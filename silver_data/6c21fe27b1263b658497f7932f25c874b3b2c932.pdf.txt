Although Fas 33 is highly expressed in cancer cells , insufficient cell surface Fas expression desensitizes cancer cells to Fas - induced 34 apoptosis . Here , we show that the increase in Fas microaggregate formation on the plasma membrane in response 35 to the inhibition of endocytosis sensitizes cancer cells to Fas - induced apoptosis . We used a clinically accessible 36 Rho - kinase inhibitor , fasudil , that reduces endocytosis dynamics by increasing plasma membrane tension . In 37 combination with exogenous soluble FasL ( sFasL ) , fasudil promoted cancer cell apoptosis , but this collaborative 38 effect was substantially weaker in nonmalignant cells . The combination of sFasL and fasudil prevented 39 glioblastoma cell growth in embryonic stem cell - derived brain organoids and induced tumor regression in a 40 xenograft mouse model . Our results demonstrate that sFasL has strong potential for apoptosis - directed cancer 41 therapy when Fas microaggregate formation is augmented by mechano - inhibition of endocytosis . 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 Fas ( CD95 / APO - 1 ) is a death receptor in the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) superfamily that regulates 58 immune system homeostasis 1 . The physiologic ligand of Fas , FasL , is a type II transmembrane protein expressed 59 on the surface of activated T cells and natural killer cells 2 . These cells can also secrete a soluble form of FasL 60 ( sFasL ) that lacks the transmembrane domain a nd is therefore able to circulate freely in the bloodstream 3 . Upon 61 ligation at the plasma membrane , Fas clusters form and generate the death - inducing signaling complex ( DISC ) , 62 which activates caspase - 8 to initiate a downstream signaling cascade that leads to apoptosis 2 , 4 . Intracellular Fas 63 trafficking , including recycling via endosomes to the plasma membrane , plays a vital role in ligand - induced DISC 64 assembly 5 , 6 . 65 Since Fas expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and metastasis in numerous types of 66 cancer , there have been several attempts to target Fas - mediated apoptosis to specifically kill tumor cells 7 – 15 . 67 However , the development of a systemic therapy utilizing sFasL has thus far failed because sFasL alone has weak 68 apoptosis - inducing capacity in vivo 8 and most human tumors are desensitized to Fas - induced apoptosis 14 , 16 . 69 Attempts to increase the efficacy of sFasL using cross - linking antibodies resulted in systemic toxicity in mice 8 . 70 Thus , novel approaches to targeting the Fas - mediated apoptosis pathway are needed to take advantage of 71 differences in Fas expression and signaling between cancer and normal cells . 72 The aggregation of Fas receptors in the plasma membrane increases the efficiency of DISC formation 73 upon FasL stimulation 17 , 18 . As Fas levels below the threshold for ligand - induced clustering render cancer cells 74 insensitive to Fas - induced apoptosis 6 , 19 – 21 , cancer cells have adopted distinct strategies to reduce Fas surface 75 levels . For example , in tumor cells lacking functional p53 , Fas is not transported from the Golgi complex to the 76 plasma membrane 22 . Moreover , Fas molecules endocytosed from the cancer cell surface are predominantly 77 delivered to lysosomes for degradation , not recycled to the plasma membrane 6 . Therefore , we aimed to determine 78 whether slowing the endocytic machinery decreases Fas internalization and increases Fas density at the plasma 79 membrane , ultimately increasing the susceptibility of cancer cells to Fas - induced apoptosis in the presence of 80 sFasL through activation of the caspase cascade ( Fig . 1a ) . 81 Cells utilize endocytosis machinery to transform flat membrane patches into highly curved endocytic 82 pockets and vesicles 23 – 26 ; such curvature generation is hindered by mechanical tension on the plasma membrane , 83 a potent and reversible regulator of endocytosis dynamics in cells 26 – 30 . Increasing membrane tension is one way 84 to disrupt endocytosis and thus significantly alter the plasma membrane proteome 31 , 32 , thereby regulating various 85 cellular and organismal processes 31 , 33 – 35 . Interestingly , the membrane tension of cancer cells is significantly lower 86 than that of their nonmalignant counterparts 36 – 38 . Although lower membrane tension may set the stage for 87 dysregulated endocytosis that contributes to malignant progression 39 , 40 , cancer cells are likely more susceptible 88 to perturbations that impede endocytosis dynamics by elevating membrane tension 37 , 38 . In this study , we show 89 that fasudil 41 , a clinically used Rho - kinase inhibitor , inhibits endocytosis in cancer cells by increasing plasma 90 membrane tension . In support of our hypothesis , we found that inhibition of endocytosis increased the formation 91 of Fas microaggregates on the cell surface and , thereby rendering cancer cells susceptible to Fas - induced 92 apoptosis in the presence of sFasL . We further show that this strategy can be used to prevent glioblastoma growth 93 in cortical organoids and mouse xenografts . Taken together , these results demonstrate that tumors can be targeted 94 by Fas - induced apoptosis through the application of sFasL in combination with agents that reduce endocytosis 95 dynamics and increase the formation of Fas microaggregates . 96 97 Results 98 Reduced actomyosin contractility by fasudil leads to mechano - inhibition of endocytosis . 99 Mechano - inhibition of endocytosis is characterized in cultured cells using techniques that allow 100 modulation of plasma membrane tension , such as cell stretching 27 , 42 , aspiration 43 , squeezing 28 , and hypo - osmotic 101 swelling 28 , 44 . Although these approaches are effective in vitro , they are not suitable for systemic inhibition of 102 endocytosis . Alternatively , reduced actomyosin contractility has been proposed to increase membrane tension by 103 increasing the adhesion between the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cortex 45 . Correspondingly , we 104 found that inhibition of the Rho - kinase by 40 µM fasudil treatment increased actin localization in the cell cortex 105 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a - d ) . The interaction between plasma membrane phospholipids and proteins and the 106 underlying cortical actin is mediated by ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) family of proteins , known regulators of 107 membrane tension 38 , 46 , 47 . Indeed , we found that fasudil treatment increased the peripheral localization of 108 phosphorylated ERM along with actin ( Supplementary Fig . 1e , f ) , and resulted in significantly higher membrane 109 tension in SUM159 triple - negative breast cancer cells ( Fig . 1a , b ) . 110 To assess the effects of fasudil on endocytosis , we focused on the dynamics of endocytic clathrin - coated 111 carriers , as it was previously shown that the internalization of Fas is mediated by this pathway 48 . To this end , we 112 used spinning - disk fluorescence microscopy to detect endocytic clathrin coats in live SUM159 cells that were 113 genome - edited to express clathrin adaptor protein AP2 fused with GFP 49 , 50 . Using the AP2 signal as a proxy for 114 clathrin coats allowed us to decouple endocytic activity from the clathrin - mediated membrane trafficking 115 originating from intracellular organelles 51 . As expected , the endocytic clathrin coats on the adherent surface of 116 SUM159 cells became increasingly static after fasudil treatment ( Fig . 1c ) . To quantitatively assess the changes in 117 endocytosis dynamics , we measured the standard deviation ( SD ) of the clathrin growth rates 43 , a robust indicator 118 of clathrin - mediated endocytosis dynamics 28 , 29 , and observed a significant reduction following fasudil treatment 119 ( Fig . 1d ) . Contrary to fasudil treatment , increased actomyosin contractility by 30 nM leptin treatment for 24 hours 120 resulted in significant reduction in membrane tension and , consequently , increased endocytosis dynamics 121 ( Supplementary Fig . 1c - e ) . Overall , our results demonstrate an inverse relationship between membrane tension 122 and actomyosin contractility and that increased membrane tension by fasudil treatment mechanically slows 123 endocytosis . 124 125 Inhibition of endocytosis increases formation of Fas microaggregates on the cell surface . 126 Given the ability of fasudil to slow endocytosis in cancer cells , we next aimed to investigate the effects of 127 fasudil - mediated endocytosis inhibition on the membrane density and distribution of Fas receptors in a broad 128 range of cancer cells . To accomplish this , Fas distribution in glioblastoma ( U87 ) , lung carcinoma ( A549 ) , liver 129 carcinoma ( HepG2 ) , prostate cancer ( PC3 ) , and triple - negative breast cancer ( SUM159 ) cells and in noncancerous 130 human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) was evaluated by immunofluorescence imaging . The Fas 131 immunofluorescence signal was significantly higher in cancer cells than in HUVECs , in accordance with the 132 previous studies reporting high levels of Fas expression in cancer cells 7 – 14 ( Fig . 2a ) . Fas receptors were observed 133 as bright punctae on the surface of the cancer cells , indicating microaggregate formation ( Fig . 2a ; Supplementary 134 Video 1 ) . As the next step , we sought to examine the effect of fasudil - mediated inhibition of endocytosis by 135 treating these cells with 40 µM fasudil for two hours . Upon treatment , the signal density of Fas microaggregates 136 increased ~ 2 - fold on cancer cells , whereas no effect was observed on HUVECs ( Fig . 2a - c ) . These results 137 demonstrate that inhibition of endocytosis by fasudil treatment enhances the formation of Fas microaggregates 138 on the surface of cancer cells . 139 To corroborate the effects of endocytosis inhibition on Fas receptor density , we evaluated the formation 140 of Fas microaggregates in cells treated with blebbistatin or dyngo - 4a , which impede endocytosis dynamics 141 mechanically and chemically , respectively . The myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin decreases actomyosin 142 contractility in cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , thereby increasing plasma membrane tension similar to fasudil 45 , 52 , 143 whereas dyngo - 4a inhibits receptor endocytosis by directly targeting the dynamin GTPase required for endocytic 144 vesicle scission 53 . Consistent with the effects of fasudil , endocytosis inhibition by 10 µM blebbistatin or 5 µM 145 dyngo - 4a markedly increased the signal of Fas microaggregates on cancer cells treated for 2 hours , whereas no 146 such increase was observed in HUVECs ( Fig . 2d , e ) . 147 We next aimed to elucidate the mechanism behind the increase in signal density of Fas microaggregates 148 upon endocytosis inhibition . Using flow cytometry to quantify protein expression , we found that 40 µM fasudil 149 treatment for two hours results in no significant difference in the total expression levels of Fas ( Supplementary 150 Fig . 2a ) . To determine whether the increase in Fas signal density is exclusive to the cell surface , we used spinning 151 disk confocal imaging to specifically analyze the ventral / adherent surface of the plasma membrane 152 ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . The fasudil - or dyngo - 4a - mediated inhibition of endocytosis had no marked effect on 153 the spatial density of Fas microaggregates on the adherent surface ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . However , the mean 154 immunofluorescence intensity of Fas microaggregates increased by up to one order of magnitude on the cancer 155 cell surface but did not increase on the surface of noncancerous cells , i . e . , HUVECs or human bronchial epithelial 156 ( HBE ) cells ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) . Taken together , these results show that the inhibition of endocytosis does 157 not affect the expression levels of Fas but promotes the growth of Fas microaggregates by increasing the number 158 of Fas molecules on the cell surface . 159 160 Inhibition of endocytosis sensitizes cancer cells to soluble Fas ligand . 161 Given that the modulation of endocytosis increases Fas localization at the cell surface , we next sought to 162 evaluate whether inhibiting endocytosis sensitizes cancer cells to exogenous FasL treatment . To this end , we 163 assessed cell viability by quantifying ATP levels in culture medium after 48 hours of treatment with human 164 recombinant sFasL alone or in combination with endocytosis inhibition . As shown in Fig . 3a , treatment with 400 165 ng / mL sFasL alone resulted in mild to moderate reduction in cancer cell viability ( 55 . 6 % , 80 . 2 % , 42 . 3 % , 67 . 8 % , 166 44 . 6 % , and 59 . 9 % in U87 , PC3 , BT549 , A549 , HepG2 , and SUM159 cells , respectively , compared to the control ) . 167 However , the addition of 40 µM fasudil increased the effect of sFasL , substantially decreasing the viability of the 168 cancer cells ( 3 . 6 - 24 . 2 % ) . As expected , unlike the effects observed in cancer cells , the viability of HUVECs , HBE 169 cells , and induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPS ) - derived cardiomyocytes was minimally affected by the combination 170 of fasudil and sFasL ( 84 . 0 % , 75 . 9 % , and 89 . 6 % , respectively , compared to the control ) ( Fig . 3b ; Supplementary 171 Videos 2 & 3 ) . Together , these results demonstrate that targeting endocytosis specifically increases the sensitivity 172 of cancer cells to sFasL while sparing noncancerous cells . 173 To confirm that the reduction in viability is due to an increase in apoptosis , we monitored the activity of 174 apoptotic markers caspase - 3 and caspase - 8 in U87 cells as we aimed to use these cells in our organoid and 175 xenograft mouse models . In support of our hypothesis , we found that the inhibition of endocytosis upon fasudil 176 treatment increased caspase - 3 and caspase - 8 activity in the presence of sFasL ( Fig . 3c ) . To further corroborate 177 that sensitization of U87 cells to sFasL is due to endocytosis inhibition , we performed cytotoxicity assays using 178 alternative chemical and mechanical approaches to temporarily reduce endocytic rates . In our first approach , cells 179 were pretreated with a combination of 400 ng / mL sFasL and a chemical endocytosis inhibitor ( either 5 µM dyngo - 180 4a or 2 µM pitstop - 2 ) for 30 minutes and subsequently treated with 400 ng / mL sFasL only . After 24 hours , we 181 found that even transient inhibition of endocytosis dynamics ( for 30 minutes ) significantly increased caspase - 8 182 activity in the presence of sFasL ( Fig . 3d ) . In our second approach , we relied on a purely mechanical strategy to 183 slow endocytosis dynamics . Specifically , we temporarily increased membrane tension by incubating U87 cells 184 with 400 ng / mL sFasL in 80 % hypotonic culture medium for 30 minutes , as hypo - osmotic swelling during this 185 period is known to result in increased membrane tension and slower endocytosis dynamics 28 , 30 , 54 . After 30 186 minutes , the mechano - inhibition of endocytosis was ceased by replacing the medium with isotonic medium ( 100 % 187 culture medium ) containing 400 ng / mL sFasL . Quantification of caspase - 8 activity after 24 hours revealed that a 188 short exposure to hypotonic medium significantly increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to exogenous sFasL 189 ( Fig . 3d ) . On the contrary , caspase - 8 activity in the presence sFasL reduced significantly when endocytosis 190 dynamics are increased by 30 nM leptin treatment ( Fig . 3d ) . To conclude , our findings demonstrate that inhibition 191 of endocytosis increases the apoptotic efficacy of sFasL in cancer cells . 192 193 Fas - mediated apoptosis targets glioblastoma in a brain organoid model 194 Next , we wanted to assess the potential utility of sensitizing cancer cells to Fas - induced apoptosis as a 195 strategy for targeted cancer therapy by testing in physiologically relevant contexts . Therefore , we generated a 3D 196 in vitro glioblastoma model based on embryonic stem cell - derived cortical brain organoids 55 containing U87 197 glioblastoma cells labeled with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ) . This approach allowed us to visualize and 198 quantitatively assess changes in the glioblastoma mass within each organoid ( Fig . 4a ) . Treatment with the 199 combination of fasudil and sFasL ( fasudil + sFasL ) did not increase the percentage of apoptotic cells in 78 - day - old 200 brain organoids without U87 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . However , U87 cell - containing brain organoids 201 treated with fasudil + sFasL for three days showed a dramatic decrease in the volume occupied by RFP - labeled 202 U87 cells , leaving an acellular space ( Fig 4b , c ) . The organoids stained positively for the neural progenitor marker 203 SOX2 and the differentiated neural marker anti - β - Tubulin III ( TUJ1 ) before and after the treatment ( Fig . 4b ; 204 Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . Altogether , these results demonstrate that treatment with fasudil + sFasL specifically 205 increases Fas - induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells in brain organoids and has a minimal effect on the viability 206 of neural progenitor cells . 207 To assess the effect of fasudil + sFasL on U87 glioblastoma cells in brain organoids at single - cell 208 resolution , we performed single - cell transcriptome analysis with a total of 1391 , 1097 , and 2149 cells derived 209 from organoids that were untreated , treated for 24 hours , or treated for 72 hours , respectively . We identified 21 210 clusters that were systematically classified into 13 cell types , including neurons , astrocytes , neural progenitor 211 cells , and glioblastoma cells ( Fig . 4d , e ) . Uniform manifold approximation and projection ( UMAP ) plots showed 212 a dramatic decrease in the number of glioblastoma cells after 24 hours of treatment , with this population becoming 213 negligible after 72 hours of treatment ( Fig . 4f , g ) . A comparison of the global transcriptomes of untreated 214 organoids and those treated with fasudil + sFasL identified 611 and 252 genes that were significantly up - and 215 downregulated by treatment , respectively . Gene Ontology analysis revealed that the upregulated genes are 216 enriched in the oxidative stress response ( e . g . , GCLM , HSF1 , and OGG1 ) , apoptosis ( e . g . , MSH6 , DNAJA1 , and 217 TRAP1 ) and DNA repair ( e . g . , FOXO4 , MDM4 , and CUL4A ) ( false discovery rate ( FDR ) < 0 . 05 by 218 hypergeometric test ) . In contrast , the glycoprotein ( e . g . , MVD and OST4 ) , ATP ( e . g . , COX5B and COX6C ) , sterol 219 ( e . g . , NPC1 and NPC2 ) and collagen metabolic processes ( e . g . , MMP2 and VIM ) were significantly 220 downregulated ( FDR < 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 4h ) . The upregulation of cell death - related genes and downregulation of 221 metabolic genes in response to fasudil + sFasL were more pronounced in glioblastoma cells than in noncancer 222 cells , such as neurons , and neural progenitor cells . Interestingly , both apoptotic and metabolic genes were 223 upregulated in astrocytes after treatment ( Fig . 4h ) . 224 225 Combination therapy of U87 glioblastoma in vivo xenografted tumors with fasudil and sFasL . 226 Motivated by the targeted killing of U87 glioblastoma cells within cortical organoids , we further evaluated 227 the antitumor efficacy of fasudil and sFasL as monotherapy and in combination using a subcutaneous U87 cell 228 xenograft tumor model in athymic nude mice . In our preliminary in vivo assays , we found that , although high 229 doses of sFasL result in systemic toxicity , the combination of 50 mg / kg Fasudil + 180 µg / kg sFasL is tolerated 230 by mice upon intraperitoneal delivery ( see Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . However , this treatment led to no significant 231 difference in tumor growth between the treatment arms ( i . e . , sFasL monotherapy , fasudil monotherapy and 232 fasudil + sFasL ) and the vehicle arm ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Next , in an attempt to increase local drug 233 concentration , the drugs were administered intratumorally twice a week in the beginning of the assay and the 234 treatment route was switched to intraperitoneal administration after two weeks . We found that , 26 days after 235 tumor cell implantation , the combination treatment ( i . e . , fasudil + sFasL ) significantly inhibited tumor growth 236 compared to vehicle or monotherapy ( Fig . 5a ) . The median survival of mice treated with vehicle , fasudil or sFasL 237 monotherapy ranged from 27 - 28 days , with fewer than 40 % of the animals surviving one month after tumor cell 238 implantation ( Fig . 5b ) . Whereas , 26 days post implantation , while 37 . 5 % ( 3 / 8 ) of mice in the control group 239 reached endpoint , none of the mice in the combination treatment arm reached endpoint and tumor growth was 240 observed in only one mouse . Fifty percent ( 4 / 8 ) of the mice in the combination arm showed tumor regression , 241 and notably , one of the mice showed complete tumor regression ( Fig . 5c ) . These results demonstrate that the local 242 administration of fasudil + sFasL , but not either alone , significantly suppresses glioblastoma tumor growth , with 243 potential curative effects in vivo . Overall , our results in cortical organoids and mouse xenograft tumor models 244 demonstrate that sFasL can potentially be utilized as an effective and selective anticancer drug when combined 245 with fasudil - mediated endocytosis inhibition . 246 247 Discussion 248 Dysregulation of endocytosis has been linked to pathogenesis of numerous diseases 56 – 58 . Endocytosis 249 dynamics is elevated in cancer cells to help reduce the expression of membrane proteins 56 , 59 , 60 , including death 250 receptors 61 , 62 . Herein we show that fasudil , a clinically used vasodialator , hinders endocytosis dynamics in cancer 251 cells by increasing the mechanical tension on the plasma membrane . Our results suggest that the increase in 252 membrane tension is due to increased membrane - cytoskeleton adhesion upon reduced acto - myosin contractility , 253 as proposed earlier 45 . Mechano - inhibition of endocytosis will enable further dissection of endocytosis function at 254 the systemic level in different disease states , including cancer . 255 Cancer cells co - opt mechanisms to exploit Fas expression as a survival factor while circumventing Fas - 256 induced apoptosis 15 . Our study aimed to sensitize cancer cells to Fas - induced apoptosis to transform this cell 257 survival strategy into targeted cancer therapy . We show that inhibition of endocytosis promotes the formation of 258 Fas microaggregates on the cell surface and thus decreases the ability of cancer cells to resist Fas - induced 259 apoptosis . In a physiological context , this sensitivity can be activated via mechano - inhibition of endocytosis by 260 fasudil . Overall , our results in cortical organoids and a mouse xenograft tumor model demonstrate that sFasL 261 combined with fasudil has potential utility as an effective and selective anticancer therapeutic regimen . 262 Our results demonstrate that endocytosis inhibition does not affect the expression of Fas but increases the 263 surface availability , promoting Fas microaggregation on the cancer cell surface . So far , there have been opposing 264 reports regarding whether internalization of TNF family receptors form the cell surface is required for the 265 induction of death receptor - induced apoptosis 48 , 63 , 64 . Our findings support models proposing that the 266 internalization of the death receptors from the plasma membrane is not required for activation of the caspase 267 cascade 64 . 268 We note that the cytotoxic activity of sFasL is orders of magnitude lower than that of membrane delivered 269 FasL 8 . It was previously proposed that tumor cells release sFasL as a means to antagonize the effects of 270 membrane - bound FasL 8 , 65 or evade immune response 66 . Further investigations may establish whether sFasL shed 271 by cancer cells may account for the increased caspase - 8 activity observed in our assays upon endocytosis 272 inhibition ( mechanical or chemical ) even in the absence of exogenous sFasL . 273 Finally , emerging research shows that cancer cells exhibit significantly lower membrane tension compared 274 to their non - malignant counterparts 36 – 38 . Future investigations may delve into whether this reduced plasma 275 membrane tension renders cancer cells more susceptible to mechano - inhibition of endocytosis . Moreover , 276 exploring the mechanical characteristics of cancer cells could unveil opportunities to enhance the specificity of 277 targeted therapies . This line of inquiry holds promise for advancing our understanding of cancer biology and 278 optimizing therapeutic strategies . 279 280 281 282 Materials and Methods 283 hESCs culture 284 BC4 hESCs 55 were cultured on Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) coated dishes with mTeSR1 media ( Stem Cell 285 Technologies ) and passaged every week by disassociating with 0 . 83 U / mL Dispase ( Stem Cell Technologies ) . 286 All experiments including hESCs were approved by Yale Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight ( ESCRO ) . 287 Cancer cell culture 288 U87 , A549 , and HepG2 cell lines were purchased from ATCC and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 289 10 % FBS and 1 % pen / strep ( Thermo Fischer ) . PC3 and BT549 cells were donated by Yale Center for Precision 290 Cancer Modeling ( YCPCM ) and cultured in F - 12 ( Thermo Fischer ) or RPMI ( Thermo Fischer ) media 291 supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % pen / strep , respectively . SUM159 cells genome edited to express AP2 - EGFP 292 were donated by Tomas Kirchhausen’s group at Harvard Medical School 50 . SUM159 cells were cultured in F - 12 293 media supplemented with 5 % FBS , 1 % pen / strep , 1mg / ml hydrocortisone ( Sigma Aldrich ) and 10mg / ml insulin 294 ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Cells were kept at optimal density by passaging when needed . In viability experiments , cells 295 were treated with different combinations of 400 ng / mL human recombinant sFasL ( Biolegend ) , 40 μ M Fasudil 296 HCl ( SellekChem ) , 10 μ M Blebbistatin ( Sigma ) , 5 μ M Dyngo - 4a ( Cayman Chemical ) , or 2 µM Pitstop - 2 297 ( Abcam ) , hypotonic medium ( 80 % of medium was replaced with water ) in 96 - well plates for 48 hours . Cell 298 viability was quantified by detection of ATP content in the culture medium with CellTiter - Glo® Luminescent 299 Cell Viability Assay ( Promega ) by following the manufacturer’s instructions . To assess the rate of apoptosis , 300 caspase - 3 and caspase - 8 activities were measured using the EnzChek Caspase - 3 Activity Assay Kit and the 301 CaspGLOW™ Fluorescein Active Caspase - 8 Staining Kit , respectively . The fluorescence generated by active 302 caspase - 3 and - 8 formation was monitored at 25°C at excitation wavelengths ( λ ex = 485 nm ) and emission 303 wavelengths ( λ em = 535 nm ) using an Infinite M1000 Pro plate reader ( Tecan , Baldwin Park , CA , USA ) . Leptin 304 ( Sigma ) concentration used in the caspase assays was 30 nM . 305 306 Immunofluorescence microscopy and image analysis 307 Cells were fixed with ice cold 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 308 ( Fisher Biotech , Hampton , NH , USA ) , and blocked with PBS supplemented with goat serum ( 2 % , v / v ) ( Southern 309 biotech ) and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( Thermo Fisher ) . Cells were then incubated with FAS Mouse anti - Human ( Clone : 310 4F8H6 , Invitrogen ) at 1 : 500 dilution and the appropriate fluorochrome - conjugated secondary antibody ( Alexa 311 Fluor 647 anti - mouse IgG1 , Fischer Scientific ) for Fas immunostaining . For labeling of actin filaments and 312 pERM , cells were treated with Phalloidin AF405 ( Thermo Fischer Scientific , 1 : 2000 dilution ) and anti - pERM 313 ( Cell Signaling Technology # 3726 , 1 : 500 ) for 10 - 15 minutes at room temperature , following either the blocking 314 step or secondary antibody labeling , depending on the experimental design . For nuclei staining , cells were 315 incubated with Hoechst ( 1 : 2000 ) for 2 minutes at room temperature after secondary antibody labeling . 316 For quantitative analysis of cell surface - associated Fas expression , fluorescent images of the immunostained cells 317 were collected using a Nikon TIE fluorescence microscope equipped with a CSU - W1 spinning disk unit 318 ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation ) , 100× objective lens ( Nikon CFI Plan - Apochromat Lambda , NA 1 . 45 ) , sCMOS 319 camera ( Prime 95B ; Teledyne Photometrics ) , and 488 - and 640 - nm excitation lasers with 100 mW of nominal 320 power . Images were acquired at a rate of 0 . 25 – 0 . 5 Hz with a laser exposure of 100 ms per frame . Image acquisition 321 was performed using NIS Elements software . 322 A comparative analysis of Fas expression was conducted using Fiji software 323 ( https : / / imagej . net / Fiji / Downloads ) by quantifying signal intensities obtained from confocal sections . To quantify 324 the number , size , and area fraction of Fas puncta , the surface area of each cell was demarcated and subsequently 325 masked to create binary images by using the ‘analyze particles’ function of the same software 67 . After background 326 subtraction , original image sections were multiplied by the mask obtained from the same field of view . For each 327 cell , the mean intensity of spots was calculated by dividing the integrated intensity of the selected area by the 328 number of detected spots . 329 Actin rearrangement and the cellular distribution of pERM were assessed through quantification of actin and 330 pERM signal intensities in the peripheral regions , defined as the outermost 20 % of the whole cell diameter , against 331 central regions , encompassing 60 % of the cell diameter . 332 Membrane tether force measurements 333 Membrane tether force measurements were conducted at 37 o C using the C - Trap optical tweezers system 334 ( LUMICKS , Amsterdam , The Netherlands ) . SUM159 cells gene - edited to express AP2 – eGFP 50 were plated in a 335 custom - designed flow chamber 15 - 24 hours prior to the experiments and incubated at 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 . The 336 flow chamber was composed of a microscope cover glass ( No 1 . 5 , Fisher Scientific ) , a layer of parafilm tape as 337 a separator , and a 1 . 0 mm thick microscope slide ( Fisher Scientific ) . This selection of thicknesses for the cover 338 glass , parafilm , and glass slide is designed for the flow channel to be compatible with the working distance of our 339 C - Trap objective and condenser . 340 Tethers were pulled from the plasma membrane using streptavidin - coated polystyrene beads with a mean diameter 341 of 1 . 87 μm ( SVP - 15 , Spherotech ) . Right before the experiments , F - 12 growth medium was replaced with phenol 342 red - free L15 imaging medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( containing the beads ) 343 and the flow channel inlet and outlet were immediately sealed . The imaging medium was prepared by diluting 344 the bead suspension down to 0 . 01 % w / v , spinning and resuspending the suspension once in PBS and then in 345 phenol red - free L15 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS . 346 The trap stiffness was calibrated using the thermal noise spectrum . After calibration , the trap stage was moved at 347 a speed of 1μm / s until the bead contacted the cell . After 4 - 10 seconds , the stage was moved in the opposite 348 direction at a speed of 5μm / s to attain a tether length of 10μm . The tether was then held stationary for up to a 349 minute to measure the static tether force as described previously 68 . 350 Imaging clathrin - mediated endocytosis dynamics in live cells 351 Fluorescence imaging was performed using a Nikon TIE fluorescence microscope equipped with a CSU - W1 352 spinning disk unit ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation ) , a 100× objective lens ( Nikon CFI Plan - Apochromat 353 Lambda , NA 1 . 45 ) , a sCMOS camera ( Prime 95B ; Teledyne Photometrics ) , and 488 nm excitation lasers with 354 100 mW of nominal power and temperature - controlled chamber . NIS Elements image acquisition software was 355 used for acquisition of 2D time - lapse movies . 356 Endocytic clathrin dynamics were captured in SUM159 cells genome edited to express AP2 - EGFP 50 . 15 - 24 hours 357 prior to imaging , cells were plated on a glass bottom dish ( MatTek Life Sciences ) and incubated at 37 o C with 5 % 358 CO 2 . Cells were imaged in phenol red - free L15 medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) supplemented with 10 % FBS 359 and 5 % ( v / v ) penicillin / streptomycin at a rate of 0 . 25 Hz with laser exposure of 100 ms per frame . Two - 360 dimensional time - lapse movies were acquired using NIS Elements software . 361 Individual clathrin - coated structures were captured and endocytic events were detected using TraCKer and 362 cmeAnalysis softwares 43 , 51 , 69 . Clathrin coat growth rate analysis was conducted was previously described 43 to 363 assess the changes in clathrin - mediated endocytosis dynamics . 364 Glioblastoma model in cortical brain organoids 365 As described previously 55 , hESCs were dissociated into single cells via Accutase and 9 , 000 cells , containing 0 . 5 % 366 RFP - infected U87 cells were plated into a well of U - bottom ultra - low - attachment 96 - well plates . Neural induction 367 medium ( DMEM - F12 , 15 % ( v / v ) KSR , 5 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated FBS ( Life Technologies ) , 1 % ( v / v ) Glutamax , 368 1 % ( v / v ) MEM - NEAA , 100 μM β - mercaptoethanol , 10 μM SB - 431542 , 100 nM LDN - 193189 , 2 μM XAV - 939 369 and 50 μM Y27632 ) was used as culture media for ten days . Organoids were transferred to ultra - low - attachment 370 six - well plate in hCO media without vitamin A ( 1 : 1 mixture of DMEM - F12 and Neurobasal media , 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) 371 N2 supplement , 1 % ( v / v ) B27 supplement without vitamin A , 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) MEM - NEAA , 1 % ( v / v ) Glutamax , 50 372 μM β - mercaptoethanol , 1 % ( v / v ) penicillin / streptomycin and 0 . 025 % insulin ) at day ten and the media was 373 changed every other day . At day 18 , Vitamin A , brain - derived neurotrophic factor , and ascorbic acid were added 374 to the culture medium . Organoids with or without glioblastoma were treated with sFasL + fasudil combination 375 after Day 75 for 72 hours for viability studies . 376 Immunofluorescence microscopy and image analysis for organoids 377 Organoids were fixed in 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight followed by three washes with 378 PBS at room temperature . Then , organoids were incubated in a 30 % sucrose solution for 2 days at 379 4 °C . Organoids were equilibrated with optical cutting temperature compound at room temperature for 15 minutes , 380 transferred to base molds , and embedded in optical cutting temperature compound on dry ice . Then , 40 - μm 381 cryosections were generated , and organoid blocks were stored at −80°C . Slides were dried for 2 hours at room 382 temperature and incubated with 0 . 1 % Triton - 100 for 15 minutes at RT in a humidified chamber . Organoids were 383 blocked with 3 % BSA at room temperature for 2 hours , and then were incubated with the primary antibodies 384 ( mouse anti - Sox - 2 and rabbit anti - TUJ - 1 ) diluted 1 : 100 in 3 % BSA overnight at 4°C . After two washing steps , 385 organoids were incubated with Alexa Fluor Dyes ( 1 : 500 ) for 1 hour following nuclei staining with DAPI 386 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) . Finally , slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent and images were taken with a CSU - 387 W1 spinning disk unit ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation ) , 20× objective lens ( CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda 388 20x / 0 . 75 , WD 1 mm , No : MRD00205 ) , Andor iXon camera ( Ultra888 EMCCD , 1024x1024 ( pix ) , 13 um pixel ) , 389 and 488 - , 550 - , and 640 - nm excitation lasers with 100 mW of nominal power . DNA strand breaks were detected 390 with TUNEL stain ( 11684795910 , Sigma ) to detect apoptotic or dead cells following the manufacturer’s protocol . 391 The ratio of the mean signal intensity for TUNEL stain to DAPI was calculated for each image . 392 For quantitative analysis of TUJ1 and SOX2 staining in the organoids , manual masks of the maximum intensity 393 projection of the images were generated using ImageJ . The DAPI signal in these masks was used to segment the 394 nuclei and postprocess the data using the Python package scikit - image . Nuclei segmentation was performed using 395 Cellpose , with a user - trained model . The masks retrieved by Cellpose were then expanded by three pixels radially 396 using the function expand _ labels ( from sci - kit image ) to encapsulate the entire cell . For each of the cell masks , 397 the mean intensity in the TUJ1 , SOX2 and DAPI channels was calculated using the function 398 skimage . measure . regionprops and the background intensity was subtracted . 399 400 Flow cytometry analysis 401 Cells were cultured under specified conditions , then washed with Phosphate - Buffered Saline ( PBS ) and detached 402 using trypsin in preparation for counting and staining procedures . To evaluate Fas ( CD95 ) expression , 3 . 0 × 10 5 403 cells were suspended in 3 . 7 % Paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) and incubated for 15 minutes at 4°C in the dark . This was 404 followed by a permeabilization step with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 20 minutes at 4°C in the dark . After each step , 405 cells were washed with PBS to remove any residual reagents . For blocking , cells were treated with 3 % Bovine 406 Serum Albumin ( BSA ) in Flow Cytometry Staining buffer ( Thermo Fisher ) overnight ( ON ) . Subsequently , cells 407 were stained with either CD95 APC antibody ( Clone 1507 , Thermo Fisher ) or the APC IgG1 antibody ( Thermo 408 Fisher ) as an isotype control . The staining was performed for 45 minutes at 4°C in the dark . Following staining , 409 cells were washed twice with PBS and kept on ice prior to flow cytometry analysis . 410 411 The stained cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson LSR II flow cytometer at the Ohio State University 412 Flow Cytometry Shared Resources . Data analysis was conducted using FlowJo software ( version 8 . 8 . 6 , Treestar 413 Inc ) . Initial gating with FSC - A and SSC - A was performed to exclude dead cells , and subsequently , FSC - W and 414 SSC - W gating was employed to eliminate doublets . For each sample , ~ 10 , 000 events were captured , and the mean 415 fluorescence intensity of the CD95 APC was analyzed using FlowJo software . 416 417 Data processing of single - cell RNA - seq 418 Single - cell RNA - seq reads were mapped to GRCh38 human genome ( GRCh38 - 2020 - A ) and counted with 419 Ensembl genes using the count function of CellRanger software ( v3 . 0 . 2 ) with default parameters . Batch effect 420 and intrinsic technical effects were normalized by Seurat ( v3 . 0 . 2 ) 70 . Briefly , we filtered out cells with less than 421 50 detected genes and more than 15 % of mitochondria - derived reads as low - quality samples . Raw UMI count 422 was normalized to total UMI count in each library . Top 2 , 000 highly variable genes were used to identify cell 423 pairs anchoring different scRNA - seq libraries using 20 dimensions of canonical correlation analysis . All scRNA - 424 seq libraires used in this study were integrated into a shared space using the anchor cells . After scaling gene 425 expression values across all integrated cells , we performed dimensional reduction using principal component 426 analysis ( PCA ) . For the visualization , we further projected single cells into two - dimensional UMAP space from 427 the 1 st and 20 th PCs . Graph - based clustering was then implemented with shared nearest neighbor method from the 428 1 st and 20 th PCs and 0 . 8 resolution value . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) in each cluster were identified 429 with more than 1 . 25 - fold change and p < 0 . 05 by a two - sided unpaired T test . Gene Ontology analysis was 430 performed to the DEGs by GOstats Bioconductor package ( v2 . 46 . 0 ) 71 . False discovery rate was adjusted by 431 p . adjust function in R with “method = ”BH”” parameter . 432 Cluster labeling was performed by unique markers , Gene Ontology , and enrichment of gene signatures as 433 described previously 55 , 72 . Briefly , neuronal and non - neuronal clusters were separated by neuronal growth cone 434 ( STMN2 , GAP43 , and DCX ) and early neurogenesis markers ( VIM , SOX2 and HES1 ) . Neuronal clusters are 435 further classified into excitatory and inhibitory neurons by expression of glutamate ( vGLUT1 / 2 ) and GABA 436 transporters ( vGAT ) , respectively . In addition , neurons expressing neuroblast markers ( NEUROD1 / 6 ) were 437 labeled as intermediate progenitor cells ( IPCs ) , which are transitioning to newborn neurons 73 . Non - neuronal 438 clusters are classified into mitotic and non - mitotic cells with the presence and absence of cell cycle - related gene 439 expression , respectively . The mitotic clusters were labeled as NPC S , NPC S / G1 , or NPC G1 by S ( PCNA , MCM2 ) 440 and G1 phase markers ( TOP2A , and MKI67 ) . The non - mitotic clusters with significant overrepresentation of a 441 GO term “Astrocyte differentiation ( GO : 0048708 ) ” were assigned to astrocytes . Astrocyte clusters with high 442 expression of GFAP and S100B were further labeled as mature astrocytes . HOPX - expressing non - mitotic clusters 443 were assigned to radial glia cells . A non - mitotic cluster without astrocyte marker expression , but with significant 444 overrepresentation of “glial cell development ( GO : 0021782 ) ” was labeled as a glial progenitor cell . 445 Neuroepithelial cells were assigned by expression of its markers ( PLP1 and SOX3 ) . Glioblastoma clusters were 446 assigned by unique expression of GBM biomarkers ( CD44 , ALDH1A3 , CAVIN1 , and MT1E ) . Global comparison 447 of transcriptome profiles was performed by 1 . 25 - fold average expression difference and p < 0 . 05 of two - sided 448 unpaired T test between 72h - treated and non - treated organoids . 449 Fasudil + sFasL combination therapy in U87 glioblastoma xenograft tumors 450 Ten million U87 glioblastoma cells ( ATCC ) were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of immune 451 deficient athymic nude mice ( Jackson Labs ) in a 1 : 1 mix of plain growth media and Matrigel ( Corning ) . After 452 approximately one week post transplantation when the tumors were palpable , with tumor volumes ranging from 453 50 - 200 mm 3 7 - 8 tumor bearing mice were randomly assigned to the following four treatment arms : Vehicle ( PBS ) , 454 sFasL monotherapy , fasudil monotherapy and fasudil + sFasL combination . On Mondays and Thursdays , the 455 Fasudil monotherapy and the fasudil + sFasL combination arms received a priming dose of 50 mg / kg Fasudil , 456 while the sFasL only and PBS groups received an equivalent volume of PBS injection . Twenty - four hours after 457 the priming injections , PBS , sFasL ( 180 µ g / kg ) , fasudil ( 50 mg / kg ) or fasudil ( 50 mg / kg ) and sFasL ( 180 µ g / kg ) 458 in combination , was administered to the relevant arms . Our maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) studies demonstrated 459 that the drug combinations used in this study do not cause fatality or significant weight loss in mice 460 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . 461 In the first study , the route of administration was intra - peritoneal for the entire study . In the second study , the 462 route of drug administration was intra - tumoral to the central tumor mass for two weeks but switched to intra - 463 peritoneal due to observation of trauma and tissue dehiscence at the injection sites . Tumor dimensions were 464 recorded by caliper measurements at three - day intervals and volumes calculated using the formula : ( length x 465 width 2 ) / 2 . Treatment was ceased and the mice were euthanized after endpoint volume of 1000 mm 3 was reached 466 in the vehicle arm . Tumors were excised from mice from all arms and images taken at the end of the study . 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 Acknowledgements 478 This work was funded by American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship ( 17POST33661238 ) awarded to 479 M .

Inhibition of endocytosis pathways is expected to increase 506 Fas expression on the cell surface and enhance the formation of the death - inducing signaling complex ( DISC ) in 507 the presence of sFasL . Endocytosis is slowed by increasing plasma membrane tension , which can be quantified 508 using optical tweezers to measure the membrane tether force . b , SUM159 cells treated with 40 µM fasudil showed 509 significantly higher membrane tension than did untreated cells . N cells = 19 ( untreated ) and 28 ( fasudil ) . c , 510 Endocytic clathrin coats were imaged at the ventral surface of live SUM159 cells ( genome edited to express AP2 - 511 EGFP ) that were untreated ( left ) or treated with 40 µM fasudil for two hours ( right ) . Kymographs obtained along 512 the marked regions show clathrin - mediated endocytosis dynamics , with short streaks representing fast endocytic 513 events . Streak length increased as endocytosis dynamics slowed . Fluorescence images are inverted to increase 514 visibility . d , Standard deviation ( SD ) of the clathrin growth rates significantly reduced after treatment with 40 515 µM fasudil .

Mechano - 548 inhibition involved increasing the plasma membrane tension of cells via hypotonic swelling for 30 minutes in the 549 presence of sFasL . After this point , the hypotonic medium was replaced with isotonic medium ( containing sFasL ) 550 to cease mechano - inhibition of endocytosis ( * * * * p < 0 . 0001 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 01 ; * p < 0 . 05 ; one - way ANOVA ) . 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 Fig . 4 : Fas - mediated apoptosis targets glioblastoma in a brain organoid model . 560 561 a , Cortical brain organoids were formed by culturing human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs , 99 . 5 % ) with red 562 fluorescent protein ( RFP ) - expressing U87 glioblastoma cells ( 0 . 5 % ) . b - c , Seventy - five - day - old organoids were 563 imaged using spinning disk fluorescence microscopy , where the glioblastoma mass could be distinguished using 564 RFP signal . Upon treatment with fasudil + sFasL , the RFP - expressing regions had almost disappeared by day 78 565 ( p = 0 . 022 ; unpaired t test ) . d - e , Cell types in the u niform manifold approximation and projection ( UMAP ) plot 566 of glioblastoma brain organoids .

The percentage of GB cells approached zero after 72 hours of treatment . h , After 572 24 hours of fasudil + sFasL treatment , the expression of genes related to apoptotic pathways , DNA damage , and 573 oxidative stress increased in GB cells , but that of genes related to metabolic processes decreased . 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 Fig . 5 : Local administration of fasudil and sFasL suppresses U87 glioblastoma growth in vivo . 598 599 a , Tumor sizes in fasudil + sFasL treatment arm was significantly smaller than those in any other group at the end 600 of the treatment . Panels on the right show the tumor sizes ( mean ± sd ) measured on 19 - and 26 - days post - 601 implantation ( * * * p < 0 . 001 , * * p < 0 . 01 , and * p < 0 . 05 ; ordinary one - way ANOVA ) . b , The survival probability in 602 the fasudil + sFasL group was significantly higher than that in any other group [ log - rank ( Mantel‒Cox ) test ; 603 compared to the combination group : PBS p = 0 . 022 , fasudil p = 0 . 006 , and sFasL p = 0 . 048 ] . c , Extracted tumors one 604 month after implantation . The tumor in one of the mice in the fasudil + sFasL combination group was completely 605 eliminated . 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 Supplementary Information 617 618 Supplementary Figure 1 . a - c , Immunofluorescence microscopy shows the distribution of actin in SUM159 cells 619 under different conditions . b , Reduction of actomyosin contractility by treatment with fasudil or blebbistatin 620 resulted in the disappearance of actin stress fibers observed in untreated cells ( a ) and the accumulation of actin 621 signal in the cell cortex , as marked by arrowheads . c , Activation of Rho - kinase by leptin treatment increased the 622 formation of actin stress fibers . d , Quantification of the actin signal in the peripheral regions of the cell versus the 623 center demonstrates that fasudil treatment causes a greater than two - fold increase in actin deposition in the cell 624 cortex . Leptin treatment , on the other hand , reduces this ratio significantly . e - f , Reduction of actomyosin 625 contractility by fasudil treatment resulted in the peripheral distribution of pERM ( red ) signal along with actin 626 ( green ) . g , Membrane tether forces quantified by optical tweezers experiments significantly reduced upon leptin 627 treatment . h , Reduced membrane tension by leptin treatment gave rise to significantly higher clathrin - mediated 628 endocytosis dynamics . * * * p < 0 . 001 , * p < 0 . 05 ; two - tailed t test .

The results are shown as 635 mean fluorescence intensity + / - standard deviation . ns ( nonsignificant ) , two - tailed t test . b , Spinning disk confocal 636 fluorescence microscopy was used to image Fas microaggregates exclusively at the ventral / bottom surface of 637 SUM159 cells that were genome edited to express AP2 - EGFP , a marker of endocytic clathrin coats at the plasma 638 membrane . The AP2 - EGFP signal was used to verify that the image plane coincides with the ventral surface of 639 the plasma membrane in these assays . c , The density of Fas microaggregates ( mean ± sd ) is shown for different 640 cells ( left ) . Treatment with 40 µM fasudil ( middle ) or 5 µM dyngo - 4a ( right ) for 2 hours did not significantly 641 increase microaggregate density in any of the cell types . d , Mean fluorescence intensity of Fas microaggregates 642 ( mean ± stdev ) for different cells ( left ) . Treatment with 40 µM fasudil ( middle ) or 5 µM dyngo - 4a ( right ) for 2 643 hours did not increase the intensity of Fas microaggregates in HUVECs or HBE cells but did substantially increase 644 this intensity in cancer cells ( U87 , A549 , HepG2 , PC3 and SUM159 cells ) .
