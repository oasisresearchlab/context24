Here , we comprehensively characterize the recently identified claudin - low tumor subtype . Methods : The clinical , pathological and biological features of claudin - low tumors were compared to the other tumor subtypes using an updated human tumor database and multiple independent data sets . These main features of claudin - low tumors were also evaluated in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models . Results : Claudin - low tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of luminal differentiation markers , high enrichment for epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition markers , immune response genes and cancer stem cell - like features . Clinically , the majority of claudin - low tumors are poor prognosis estrogen receptor ( ER ) - negative , progesterone receptor ( PR ) - negative , and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) - negative ( triple negative ) invasive ductal carcinomas with a high frequency of metaplastic and medullary differentiation . They also have a response rate to standard preoperative chemotherapy that is intermediate between that of basal - like and luminal tumors . Interestingly , we show that a group of highly utilized breast cancer cell lines , and several genetically engineered mouse models , express the claudin - low phenotype . Finally , we confirm that a prognostically relevant differentiation hierarchy exists across all breast cancers in which the claudin - low subtype most closely resembles the mammary epithelial stem cell . Conclusions : These results should help to improve our understanding of the biologic heterogeneity of breast cancer and provide tools for the further evaluation of the unique biology of claudin - low tumors and cell lines . Introduction Genomic studies have established four major breast can - cer intrinsic subtypes ( luminal A , Luminal B , HER2 - enriched , basal - like ) and a normal breast - like group that show significant differences in incidence , survival and response to therapy [ 1 - 3 ] . However , as gene expression studies evolve , further subclassification of breast tumors into new molecular entities is expected to occur . In 2007 , we identified a new molecular subtype , referred to as claudin - low , using 13 samples [ 5 ] . These distinct tumors were found in both human and murine breast tumor data sets and were characterized by the low gene expression of tight junction proteins claudin 3 , 4 and 7 and E - cadherin , a calcium - dependent cell - cell adhesion glycoprotein . More recently , a tumor initiating cell ( TIC ) genomic sig - nature derived from CD44 + / CD24 - / low - sorted cells and mammospheres obtained from primary human breast tumors was found to be exclusively enriched by gene expression in the claudin - low subtype [ 6 , 7 ] , and the expression of this CD44 + / CD24 - / low / claudin - low profile increased in posttreatment samples after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormone therapy [ 7 ] . Overall , these studies suggest that the claudin - low tumor subtype lacks common epithelial cell features and is enriched for TIC features . In this study , we comprehensively characterize the claudin - low subtype using an updated human tumor * Correspondence : cperou @ med . unc . edu † Contributed equally 1 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center , University of North Carolina , 450 West Drive , Chapel Hill , 27599 , USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Prat et al .

In contrast to the basal - like subtype , we provide evidence that claudin - low tumors are more enriched in epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) features , immune system responses , and stem cell - associated biological processes . The molecular characterization of the clau - din - low intrinsic subtype in tumors and cell lines reveals a breast cancer differentiation hierarchy that resembles the normal epithelial mammary developmental cascade . Materials and methods Human breast tumor microarray data sets All human tumor and normal tissue samples were col - lected using Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) - approved protocols and were obtained from fresh frozen invasive breast carcinomas that were profiled as described pre - viously using oligo microarrays ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) [ 8 ] ; we used all the microarrays from Herschkowitz et al . [ 5 ] , Parker et al . [ 9 ] and Hen - nessy et al . [ 6 ] , plus 39 new additional samples pre - sented here . All microarray and patient clinical data are available in the University of North Carolina ( UNC ) Microarray Database [ 10 ] and have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) under the acces - sion number GEO : GSE18229 ( referred to here as the UNC337 set ) . The probes or genes for all analyses were filtered by requiring the lowest normalized intensity values in both sample and control to be > 10 . The nor - malized log 2 ratios ( Cy5 sample / Cy3 control ) of probes mapping to the same gene ( Entrez ID as defined by the manufacturer ) were averaged to generate independent expression estimates . In the resulting UNC337 matrix , no significant batch effects were observed . We also used publicly available microarray and patient clinical data from the following breast cancer data sets : NKI295 [ 11 , 12 ] , MDACC133 [ 13 ] and NKI113 [ 14 ] . In MDACC133 , raw data were normalized using the robust multiarray analysis ( RMA ) normalization approach . In all data sets , genes were median - centered within each data set and samples were standardized to zero mean and unit variance before other analyses were performed . Gene expression signatures We analyzed the mean expression of multiple previously published gene signatures [ 7 , 15 - 19 ] . Briefly , these signa - tures include leukocyte - related signatures from Palmer et al . [ 17 ] : CD8 ( n = 10 genes ) , B _ Cell ( n = 286 ) , T _ Cell ( n = 178 ) , and GRANS ( n = 353 ) . Stromal - related signa - tures were obtained from West et al . [ 16 ] ( n = 402 ; DTF and SFT signatures combined ) and Beck et al . [ 19 ] ( n = 174 ) . Genes enriched more than twofold in mammo - sphere - derived cells compared with differentiated cells were obtained from Dontu et al . [ 15 ] ( n = 58 ) . From Shi - pitsin et al . [ 18 ] , we calculated the mean expression of the upregulated ( n = 357 ) and downregulated ( n = 353 ) genes from CD44 + versus CD24 + breast cancer cells from metastatic pleural effusions . From Creighton et al . [ 7 ] , we calculated the mean expression of the CD44 + / CD24 - / low / mammosphere signature reported ( n = 119 upregulated genes ; n = 279 downregulated genes ) . Finally , the prolif - eration and luminal gene cluster signatures were hand - picked ( node correlation > 0 . 75 ) from the unsupervised intrinsic hierarchical clustering of the UNC337 using the intrinsic list of Parker et al . [ 9 ] and average linkage clus - tering using Cluster v2 . 12 ( M . Eisen ) [ 20 ] as shown in Figure S1 in Additional file 1 . Gene lists from all genomic signatures are displayed in Supplemental Data in Addi - tional file 2 . Breast cancer cell line microarray data set We analyzed a data set that included Affymetrix U133A gene expression microarrays of 52 breast cancer cell lines [ 21 ] . Raw data were normalized using RMA , and genes were median - centered before analyses . Among the 52 breast cancer cell lines analyzed , DU4475 , HCC1008 and HCC1599 cell lines were not included in Neve et al . [ 21 ] . Mouse breast tumor microarray data set All mouse samples from the UNC were collected from fresh frozen invasive breast carcinomas as described pre - viously [ 5 ] using Agilent mouse oligo microarrays . Data normalization and preprocessing were identical to that described for the UNC337 data set . We used only sam - ples ( n = 104 ) from our previous publication that were included in 1 of the 10 mouse classes [ 5 ] . Claudin - low and normal breast Euclidian centroid - based predictors To robustly identify claudin - low samples , we built two predictors on the basis of either our human tumor data or the cell line data of Neve et al . [ 21 ] . To build a predic - tor , we first selected those genes that were significantly differentially expressed between claudin - low tumors defined by SigClust [ 22 ] ( or cell lines ) and all other sub - types using a two - class , unpaired SAM , with < 5 % false discovery rate ( FDR ) . Then we used these gene lists and calculated a claudin - low centroid and an “ others ” cen - troid from the training data . For every sample , we calcu - lated the Euclidean distances to the two centroids and assigned the class of the nearest centroid . Using the same methodology , we also built a normal breast predictor by selecting those genes that were significantly differentially expressed between normal breast tissues and breast tumors using a two - class , unpaired SAM , with 0 % FDR . Note that these gene lists are also included in Supple - mental Data in Additional file 2 . Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 2 of 18 Intrinsic subtype classification For all human breast tumor studies , intrinsic subtype classification was performed using the PAM50 predictor [ 9 ] . Human claudin - low tumor samples were identified using either SigClust [ 22 ] or the nine - cell line claudin - low predictor . Samples identified by SigClust [ 22 ] or the nine - cell line claudin - low predictor were called claudin - low , regardless of the PAM50 call . For breast cancer cell lines , the claudin - low subtype classification was based on unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the intrin - sic list of Parker et al . [ 9 ] and the node identified in Figure S4 in Additional file 1 . The complete gene list of the nine - cell line claudin - low predictor can be found in Supplemental Data in Additional file 2 . Mammary developmental analyses Public data sets from Raouf et al . [ 23 ] and Lim et al . [ 24 ] were downloaded from GEO and assigned NCBI Entrez gene identifiers as available in GEO . Samples were scaled to mean zero and variance of 1 . Features were then col - lapsed to the mean of each gene identifiers . In Lim et al . [ 24 ] , three epithelial cell - enriched subpopulations were profiled on DNA microarrays : mammary stem cells ( MaSC ) , luminal progenitors ( pL ) and mature luminal cells ( mL ) . We created a differentiation predictor for each sample as a measure of any sample ’ s position along a MaSC ® pL ® mL axis as defined by gene expression . Distance - weighted discrimination ( DWD ) was used to determine the direction of greatest variation from MaSC to pL and pL to mL . To map a sample onto this axis of differentiation , the pL centroid was set as the origin , and the MaSC and mL centroids were transformed to length 1 ( sum of squares equals 1 ) to map a sample onto this axis of differentiation . Before mapping a sample onto this axis , it is assumed that the test data set covers the range of differentiation , which allows median centering of genes to correct for platform bias . Test samples are then adjusted using the parameters for placing pL at the origin and are transformed to length 1 . Each sample is then projected onto the MaSC ® pL axis and the pL ® mL axis by calculating the inner product of the sample and the MaSC or mL vectors identified by DWD . The differ - ence of the two projected positions of each sample along the MaSC ® pL ® mL axis is referred to as the differen - tiation score . In the UNC microarray database web site [ 10 ] , we have provided the detailed R commands and files regarding the differentiation predictor . Mammospheres from normal breast tissues Fourteen normal breast tissues were dissociated mechani - cally and enzymatically as described in Stingl et al . [ 25 ] . The samples were procured and used according to approved IRB protocols for research in human subjects . Mammospheres were cultured according to Dontu et al . [ 15 ] , and single cells were plated onto ultralow attachment plates ( Corning ) at a density of 20 , 000 viable cells / ml . RNA was purified using RNeasy Mini kit ( Qiagen ) after 14 to 20 days in primary culture ( first passage ) , and microar - rays were performed as described above . Immunohistochemistry Formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tissue sections ( ~ 5 μ m thick ) were processed using standard immuno - histochemistry methods as previously described [ 26 ] . The sections were incubated for 60 min at room tem - perature with primary antibody to claudin 3 ( dilution 1 : 100 ; Invitrogen , Catalog No . 18 - 7340 ) or E - cadherin ( Clone No . ECH - 6 , pre - diluted ; Cell Marque ) . The slides were incubated for 45 min with diluted biotinylated sec - ondary antibody ( 1 : 250 dilution ) for 30 min with Vectas - tain Elite ABC reagent ( Vector Laboratories ) . Sections were incubated in peroxidase substrate solution for visualization . Slides were counterstained with hematoxy - lin and examined by light microscopy . Tumor immunor - eactivity was scored in a blinded fashion by two investigators ( JIH and XH ) into two categories : negative / weak positive and moderate / strong positive . Immunofluorescence Formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded sections ( ~ 5 μ m thick ) were processed using standard immunostaining methods as previously described [ 5 ] . The primary anti - bodies and their dilution were vimentin ( mouse anti - vimentin IgG1 - (cid:1) , dilution 1 : 100 ; Invitrogen , Catalog No . 18 - 0052 ) , keratin 5 ( rabbit anti - human , dilution 1 : 500 ; Abcam , Catalog No . ab24647 ) , and keratin 19 ( Abcam , Catalog No . ab7754 , mouse anti - human IgG2a ; dilution 1 : 200 ) . Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were conjugated with Alexa Fluor - 568 ( Red , keratin 5 and 19 ) or Alexa Fluor - 488 ( Green , vimentin ) fluoro - phores ( 1 : 200 ; Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) . Dual posi - tivity was scored in a blinded fashion by XH into two categories : negative meaning no dual positive cells and positive meaning the presence of dual positive cells . Cell lines SUM159PT cells ( Asterand ) were maintained in Ham ’ s F - 12 medium with 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , insulin ( 5 μ g / ml ) , and hydrocortisone ( 1 μ g / ml ) . MCF - 7 was cultured in RPMI with 10 % FBS [ 27 ] , and SUM149PT was maintained in HuMEC media with supplements ( Gibco ) with and without 5 % FBS [ 28 ] . All cell lines were grown at 37°C and 5 % carbon dioxide . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) and microarray analysis Nonconfluent cell cultures were trypsinized and filtered to produce single cell suspension , counted , washed with Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 3 of 18 Hanks ’ balanced salt solution ( Stem Cell Technologies ) containing 2 % FBS and stained with antibodies specific for human cell surface markers : EPCAM - fluorescein iso - thiocyanate ( Stem Cell Technologies ) and CD49f - phycoerythrin ( BD Pharmingen ) . A total of 500 , 000 cells were incubated with antibodies for 30 min at 4°C . Cells were washed from unbound antibodies and immediately analyzed using Beckman - Coulter ( Dako ) CyAn ADP or sorted using BD FACScan . RNA was purified from sorted cells using the RNeasy Mini kit , and microarrays were performed as described above . Statistical analyses All microarray cluster analyses were displayed using Java Treeview version 1 . 1 . 3 . Average linkage hierarchical clustering was performed using Cluster v2 . 12 [ 20 ] . Bio - logic analysis of microarray data was performed with the DAVID annotation tool [ 29 ] . ANOVA and Student ’ s t - tests for gene expression data , Fisher ’ s exact test for neoadjuvant clinical data , c 2 tests for pathological data , and the Cox model were performed using R [ 30 ] . Survi - val curves were calculated by the Kaplan - Meier method and compared by the log - rank test using WinStat v2007 . 1 . Reported P values are two - sided . Results Molecular characterization of the claudin - low breast tumor subtype To identify the molecular characteristics of claudin - low tumors , we created a large genomic data set by com - bining three of our previously published data sets [ 5 , 6 , 9 ] and included 37 new tumor samples ( n = 337 ; UNC337 , GEO series GSE18229 ) . Hierarchical cluster - ing analysis of this data set using the ~ 1 , 900 intrinsic gene list of Parker et al . [ 9 ] identified the major intrin - sic molecular subtypes , including the claudin - low sub - type ( Figure S1 in Additional file 1 ) . The validity of the claudin - low sample cluster was confirmed by par - sing the dendogram with SigClust [ 22 ] ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; notably , this clustering analysis placed the claudin - low tumors in close proximity to the basal - like subtype and was composed of 32 arrays , representing 32 patients ( ~ 12 % of all patients ) . Compared to the luminal A , luminal B , HER2 - enriched , and basal - like subtypes , claudin - low tumors showed inconsistent expression of basal keratins ( keratins 5 , 14 and 17 ) and low expres - sion of HER2 and luminal markers such as ER , PR , GATA3 , keratins 18 and 19 and the luminal gene clus - ter ( Figure 1a ) . Despite the apparent similarity to basal - like tumors , claudin - low tumors as a group did not show high expression of proliferation genes and thus are likely slower - cycling tumors . Indeed , signifi - cantly lower messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression of the cell cycle gene Ki67 was observed in claudin - low tumors when compared with basal - like tumors ( P < 0 . 0001 , Student ’ s t - test ; Figure S2 and Table S1 in Additional file 1 ) . To better characterize the claudin - low molecular sub - type , we identified those genes differentially expressed in claudin - low tumors compared with other tumors or subtypes . We found 1 , 308 and 359 genes significantly higher and lower in expression in claudin - low tumors , respectively ( Table S2 in Additional file 1 ) . Overall , clau - din - low tumors highly expressed genes involved in immune system response ( i . e . CD79b , CD14 and vav1 ) , cell communication ( chemokine [ C - X - C motif ] ligand 12 ) , extracellular matrix ( vimentin , fibroblast growth factor 7 ) , cell differentiation ( Krüppel - like factor 2 , interleukin 6 ) , cell migration ( integrin a5 , moesin ) and angiogenesis ( vascular endothelial growth factor C , matrix metallopeptidase 9 ) [ 29 ] . Conversely , expression of various epithelial cell - cell adhesion genes such as claudin 3 , claudin 4 , claudin 7 , occludin and E - cadherin was significantly lower as previously reported [ 5 ] ( Figure 1b ) . Further immunohistochemical analysis of 103 breast tumors of the UNC337 data set revealed that compared to the basal - like subtype , the claudin - low tumor subtype had a preponderance for low to absent expression of E - cadherin and claudin 3 ( 45 % vs . 11 % for E - cadherin , P < 0 . 05 ; 59 % vs . 11 % for claudin 3 , P < 0 . 005 ; c 2 test ) . Similarly , when compared to all other tumors ( basal - like , HER2 - enriched , luminal A , luminal B and normal breast - like ) as a single group , the claudin - low tumor subtype maintained its characteristic for low to absent expression of E - cadherin and claudin 3 ( 45 % vs . 15 % for E - cadherin , P < 0 . 005 ; 59 % vs . 22 % for claudin 3 , P < 0 . 001 ; c 2 test ) ( Figure S3 in Additional file 1 ) . Concordant with the expression of markers of mesenchyme and immunity , we observed high expres - sion of stromal - specific and lymphocyte - or granulocyte - specific gene signatures in claudin - low tumors compared to the other intrinsic subtypes [ 16 , 17 , 19 ] ( Figure 1b , Figure S2 in Additional file 1 ) . These findings , together with the low expression of epithelial cell - cell adhesion molecules such as E - cadherin , are consistent with an EMT ( changes in cell phenotype between epithelial and mesenchymal states ) [ 31 ] in claudin - low tumors and a potential recruitment of multiple types of leukocytes into these tumors . We next explored the mRNA expression of the TIC gene markers CD44 and CD24 and cell surface markers of epithelial differentiation such as MUC1 , CD49f , and epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ) across the intrinsic subtypes ( basal - like , claudin - low , luminal A , luminal B , HER2 - enriched ) and the normal breast - like group to determine their differentiation status . Overall , claudin - low tumors showed low mRNA expression of differentiated luminal cell surface markers ( CD24 , Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 4 of 18 EpCAM and MUC1 ) , while markers CD44 and CD49f were higher when compared to differentiated luminal tumors ( P < 0 . 05 , Student ’ s t - test ; Figure 1c , Figure S2 in Additional file 1 ) . The expression pattern of these gene markers is concordant with CD44 + / CD24 - / low and CD49f + / EpCAM - / low antigenic phenotypes , which have been previously shown to be enriched in breast TICs [ 32 , 33 ] and mammary stem cells ( MaSCs ) [ 24 ] . Second , we observed that claudin - low tumors compared to the other tumor subtypes , except for the normal breast - like group , showed the highest mRNA expression of ALDH1A1 , which has recently been proposed to be another marker of breast stem cells and TICs [ 34 ] but also noted in stromal cells [ 24 , 34 , 35 ] . Conversely , basal - like tumors did not show significantly lower expression of CD24 as a group , nor did they show high mRNA expression of ALDH1A1 ( Figure 1b and Figure S2 in Additional file 1 ) . This contrasts with other studies that have linked the basal - like subtype with stem cell - or embryonic cell - like features [ 36 , 37 ] ; however , these Figure 1 Average expression of important genes and gene signatures across the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes . ( a ) Classical markers used to characterize breast tumors are shown for mRNA expression levels for basal markers ( keratins 5 [ KRT5 ] , 14 [ KRT14 ] and 17 [ KRT17 ] ) , luminal markers ( keratins 18 [ KRT18 ] and 19 [ KRT19 ] ) , ER ( ESR1 ) , PR , GATA3 and HER2 ( ERBB2 ) .

P values shown were calculated by comparing gene expression means across all subtypes . Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 5 of 18 other studies did not examine claudin - low tumors as a separate group , and in the absence of a claudin - low pre - dictor , claudin - low tumors are typically classified as basal - like ( or normal breast - like ) by the PAM50 gene expression assay [ 9 ] . To further explore the potential enrichment for breast stem cells and TIC features , we evaluated the expression of three breast stem cell - like signatures [ 7 , 15 , 18 ] across the different subtypes . All signatures were highly enriched ( P < 0 . 0001 , Student ’ s t - test ; Supplementary Material in Additional file 2 ) in the claudin - low subtype despite the various derivations used of each signature ( Figure 1c , Figure S2 in Additional file 1 ) . Interestingly , these three stem cell - like signatures were representative of distinct gene expression subsets , among which < 10 % of the genes overlapped . These data suggest that differ - ent biological processes associated with TICs converge in the claudin - low tumor subtype . Identification of the claudin - low profile in a panel of breast cancer cell lines To investigate if potential in vitro counterparts for these tumors exist , we analyzed a data set of 52 breast cancer cell lines [ 21 ] by hierarchical cluster analysis using our most recent human breast tumor intrinsic classification list [ 9 ] . The three major subgroups ( luminal , basal B and basal A ) identified previously by Neve et al . [ 21 ] were evident , with nine basal B cell lines clustering together with a node correlation of 0 . 59 ( Figure S4 in Additional file 1 ) . These cell lines showed low expres - sion of the ER , HER2 and claudin 3 , claudin 4 and clau - din 7 ( Figure S4 in Additional file 1 ) . We identified those genes whose expression distinguished each human tumor subtype using significance analysis of microarrays ( SAM ) in our UNC337 tumor database , including a list defining the normal breast - like group ( Figure 2a ) . These nine cell lines ( MDA - MB - 435 , MDA - MB - 436 , Hs578T , BT549 , MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 157 , SUM1315MO2 , SUM159PT and HBL100 ) showed a gene expression pattern similar to the claudin - low tumor subtype with the lowest expression of genes involved in epithelial cell - cell adhesion ( i . e . , E - cadherin and claudins 3 , 4 and 7 ) , luminal differentiation ( i . e . , CD24 , EpCAM ) and high values for the CD44 / CD24 and CD49f / EpCAM mRNA ratios ( Figure S4 , Table S3 in Additional file 1 ) . To com - plement these clustering analyses , we developed a clau - din - low centroid - based predictor using the UNC337 tumor data set and the SigClust - defined claudin - low group versus all others , and objectively classified the 52 cell lines as claudin - low or not ; as expected , the human Figure 2 Identification of the claudin - low subtype in a panel of breast cancer cell lines . Gene clusters that characterize each primary human tumor subtype are shown in the human and cell line gene expression data sets . In both data sets , array trees have been derived by unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the intrinsic list from Parker et al . [ 9 ] as shown in Figure S1A and S4A in Additional file 1 . ( a ) The top 50 upregulated genes associated with each molecular subtype , including the top 50 downregulated genes in claudin - low tumors , are shown in the UNC337 database . Top genes were selected after performing a two - class SAM ( FDR = 0 % ) between each molecular subtype versus others . Luminal A and B subtypes were combined into the luminal subtype . In the tree , the yellow node denotes the claudin - low tumors defined by SigClust [ 22 ] . ( b ) Gene clusters characteristic of each tumor molecular subtype are shown in 52 breast cancer cell lines from Neve et al . [ 21 ] . Missing genes have been omitted .

Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 6 of 18 tumor - based claudin - low predictor identified these nine cell lines as claudin - low ( Figure S5 in Additional file 1 ) . The gene cluster that identifies the in vivo defined normal breast - like group was not differentially expressed by any of the 52 cell lines , suggesting overall that none of these cell lines show a normal breast - like phenotype ( Figure 2b ) . The normal breast - like group of primary specimens is usually composed of actual nor - mal breast samples and a small number of primary tumors [ 9 , 38 ] , the latter of which we believe show the high expression of true normal tissue genes due to sig - nificant normal breast contamination [ 9 ] . In cell culture , however , there is no such contamination by normal epithelial or nonepithelial cells , and thus this lack of contamination may explain why normal breast - like tumor cell lines are not identified as such by the clus - tering . To be more objective , we applied a normal breast centroid - based predictor ( normal breast versus all tumors using the UNC337 database ) to the cell line data , and no cell line was classified as normal breast ( Figure S5 in Additional file 1 ) . Contamination with other tissues or cells is not uncommon in other tumor subtypes [ 1 ] . For example , within the top highly expressed genes in claudin - low tumors versus all others , there are several wound response - related genes ( i . e . , CD28 , CD52 ) that are not expressed by the breast can - cer cell lines ( Figure 2b ) , potentially due to significant immune or stromal cell content in the tumor . Overall , these data suggest that the nine previously described breast cancer cell lines are most similar to claudin - low tumors in in vivo specimens . Building a Cell - line claudin - low centroid - based predictor Because primary human claudin - low tumors are highly enriched for immune system genes ( and lymphocytes ) when supervised analyses are performed , the expression of nonepithelial cell genes would likely increase the false positivity of the human claudin - low predictor when applied to other tumor data sets , because , for instance , tumors would be called claudin - low or not based upon the high expression of immune cell genes . Therefore , we developed a claudin - low centroid - based predictor using the cell line database of Neve et al . [ 21 ] . First , we evalu - ated its accuracy by applying the predictor onto our human tumor database ( UNC337 ) . The nine - cell line claudin - low predictor identified 37 samples ( ~ 11 % ) as claudin - low , including the 28 claudin - low samples pre - viously identified by hierarchical clustering . The remain - ing nine samples identified by the predictor were previously called basal - like ( n = 7 ) , normal breast - like ( n = 1 ) and HER2 - enriched ( n = 1 ) by the PAM50 predic - tor [ 9 ] . Overall , the nine - cell line claudin - low predictor showed 87 . 5 % sensitivity , 97 . 0 % specificity , and 75 . 7 % and 98 . 7 % positive and negative predictive values , respectively , if the SigClust - defined claudin - low group is considered the gold standard . We then used the nine - cell line claudin - low predic - tor to identify this subtype in a mouse tumor database [ 5 ] , which represents 13 different mouse models grouped in 10 different classes on the basis of their gene expression profiles ( Groups I to X ) . Interestingly , all claudin - low samples identified by the centroid pre - dictor ( n = 9 ) were included in Group II , which we previously highlighted for its mesenchymal features ( i . e . , spindle - shaped cells ) . These nine murine claudin - low tumor samples were derived from six different mouse models ( Brca1Co / Co ; TgMMTV - Cre ; p53 + / - , DMBA - induced , p53 - / - transplant , p53 + / - IR , TgMMTV - Neu and TgWAP - T121 ) and overall showed similar enrichment for EMT markers and human mesenchymal and stem cell - like signatures , including decreased expression of proliferative - and luminal - associated genes ( Figure S6 in Additional file 1 ) . No murine normal mammary tissue sample was classified as claudin - low . These analyses suggest that a cell line centroid - based approach , by focusing on genes expressed in epithelial cells only , might give more accurate classification of tumors , which could be evalu - ated in future studies focused on tumor subtyping . Clinical - pathological characteristics of claudin - low breast tumors To determine for the first time the clinical - pathological characteristics of human claudin - low breast tumors , we evaluated our breast cancer patient database ( UNC337 ) and two independent gene expression data sets ( NKI295 and MDACC133 ) [ 11 - 13 ] using the nine - cell line clau - din - low predictor and the previously published PAM50 subtype predictor ( Figure 3a ) because these two objec - tive centroid predictors have been demonstrated to be the most robust to classify breast tumors into discrete subtypes . Across all three databases , claudin - low tumors showed a prevalence of 7 to 14 % , and were mostly ER - / PR - / HER2 - ( also known as triple - negative tumors , 61 to 71 % ) . Conversely , the majority of triple - negative tumors were either basal - like ( 39 to 54 % ) or claudin - low ( 25 to 39 % ) , followed by HER2 - enriched ( 7 to 14 % ) , luminal B ( 4 to 7 % ) , luminal A ( 4 to 5 % ) and normal breast - like ( 1 % ) . In terms of prognosis , Kaplan - Meier survival ana - lysis revealed that claudin - low tumors have a worse prognosis compared to luminal A tumors in both the UNC337 ( hazard ratio [ HR ] of 2 . 83 and 5 . 66 for relapse - free survival [ RFS ] and overall survival [ OS ] , respectively ; P < 0 . 05 ) and NKI295 data sets ( HR of 4 . 71 and 17 . 98 for RFS and OS , respectively ; P < 0 . 001 ) . Con - versely , similar survival curves were observed between claudin - low tumors and the other poor prognosis sub - types such as luminal B , HER2 - enriched and basal - like Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 7 of 18 tumors ( Figure 3b ) . Normal breast - like samples were omitted from survival analyses because they are likely significantly contaminated by normal breast tissue , and thus their true tumor biology is masked . We also evaluated the potential association between claudin - low tumors and treatment response by using the MDACC breast cancer patient data set ( 133 pretreated samples ) of tumors treated with neoadjuvant anthracy - cline / taxane - based chemotherapy [ 13 ] . Notably , claudin - low tumors showed a lower pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate after anthracycline / taxane - based chemotherapy compared to basal - like tumors ( 38 . 9 % vs . 73 . 3 % pCR rates ; P = 0 . 08 , Fisher ’ s exact test ) , but their pCR rate was higher than luminal A or B tumors ; interestingly , the apparent pCR rate of the basal - like tumors increased from 59 % ( reported in Parker et al . [ 9 ] ) to ~ 73 % when the claudin - low subtype was included , because among 18 claudin - low tumors identified in this set , 12 ( 67 % ) of 18 of them were previously identified as basal - like and the response rate of this subgroup of patients was 41 . 7 % . These findings suggest that claudin - low tumors show some chemotherapy sensitivity but overall have a poor prognosis and may not be managed effectively with existing chemotherapy regimens . Twenty - one claudin - low samples were examined his - tologically by a pathologist ( CL ; Table S4 in Additional file 1 ) to further clinically characterize claudin - low tumors . Among the samples evaluated , 9 ( 43 % ) of 21 Figure 3 Clinical and pathological characteristics and prognosis of all intrinsic subtypes , including claudin - low tumors , across three independent breast cancer data sets . ( a ) Percentages of the different clinical - pathological characteristics in the UNC337 data set and two publicly available data sets ( NKI295 and MDACC133 ) . ER / PR / HER2 scores of the UNC337 database were based on clinically validated methods . ( b ) Survival data of the different molecular subtypes are shown for the UNC337 database and NKI295 . Normal breast - like samples have been removed from this analysis . The UNC337 set represents a heterogeneously treated group of patients treated in accord with the biomarker status , whereas NKI295 is predominantly a local therapy only cohort . Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 8 of 18 had noteworthy histological differentiation patterns , including medullary - like features ( 5 / 21 , 24 % ) such as pushing margins and brisk tumor lymphocytic infiltra - tion , two samples ( 2 of 21 , 10 % ) showed metaplastic dif - ferentiation , one sample showed mixed ductal / lobular features , and one sample was a pure micropapillary car - cinoma . The remaining 12 samples ( 12 of 21 , 57 % ) were invasive ductal carcinomas not otherwise specified . Overall , lymphoid infiltration was evident in a total of seven samples ( total of 7 of 19 , 37 % ) , which might explain the high mRNA expression of immune response genes present in these tumors . Among the other clau - din - low samples that could not be examined histologi - cally ( n = 16 ) , 50 % ( 8 / 16 ) had a previous diagnosis of metaplastic tumors . It is interesting to note that two claudin - low cell lines , Hs578T and MDA - MB - 157 , were derived from metaplastic [ 39 ] and medullary [ 40 ] carcinomas . Since the pathological examination of claudin - low tumors identified special histological features , we applied the nine - cell line claudin - low predictor to a publicly available database of histologically diverse subtypes of breast cancer ( n = 113 , NKI113 ) [ 14 ] , which includes 10 medullary carcinomas , 20 metaplastic carcinomas and 22 invasive lobular carcinomas ( ILC ) . Indeed , 8 ( 57 % ) of 14 and 2 ( 14 % ) of 14 claudin - low samples were identi - fied as metaplastic and medullary carcinomas , respec - tively ( Figure 4f and Table S5 in Additional file 1 ) . Conversely , only 2 of a total of 22 ILCs were identified as claudin - low despite the lack of E - cadherin expression in lobular tumors [ 41 ] . Claudin - low subtype resembles the MaSC profile We hypothesized , as did Lim et al . [ 24 ] , that a mam - mary differentiation program starting from a MaSC ® luminal progenitor ( pL ) ® mature luminal cells ( mLs ) exists , and therefore we built a differentiation model using data from Lim et al . [ 24 ] . For this predictor , higher scores represent greater differentiation status along this axis that culminates in ER + mLs ( Figure 4a ) . First , we applied this predictor onto similar subpopula - tions of purified human mammary epithelial cells that were separated by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) and profiled as part of the independent study of Raouf et al . [ 23 ] using different surface makers ( Fig - ure S7 in Additional file 1 ) . The differentiation predic - tor showed 100 % ( 8 of 8 ) accuracy with the bipotent progenitor subpopulation from Raouf et al .

[ 24 ] ) , followed by the luminal - restricted progenitor [ CD49f + ( MUC1 / CD133 ) + ( CD10 / THY1 ) - ] and then the mLs [ CD49f - ( MUC1 / CD133 ) + ( CD10 / THY1 ) - ] . In addition , we established and expression - profiled mammosphere cultures obtained from 14 different normal breast tissues because these cultures enrich for cells with stem or self - renewal capacity [ 15 ] . As expected , mammospheres showed a low differentiation score close to the MaSC profile ( Figure 4b ) . Notably , and as shown by Lim et al . [ 24 ] , the breast cancer subtypes segregate along the normal mammary epithelial differentiation hierarchy starting with undif - ferentiated claudin - low tumors , followed by basal - like , then HER2 - enriched tumors , and finally both luminal tumor subtypes ( Figure 4c ) . As expected , we observed the same pattern using the breast cancer cell line data [ 21 ] ( Figure 4d ) . Conversely , the nine - cell line claudin - low predictor identified the MaSC and stromal ( CD49f low / EpCAM - ) subpopulations of Lim et al . [ 24 ] as claudin - low , and as expected , both subpopulations showed the highest and lowest expression of the up - and downregulated genes that define the nine - cell line claudin - low predictor ( Figure S8 in Additional file 1 ) . Moreover , we applied the differentiation predictor to the mouse data set of Herschkowitz et al . [ 5 ] ( Figure 4e ) and observed that the previously identified claudin - low murine samples scored the lowest , while the MMTV - Neu and MMTV - PyMT models , which are known luminal mammary adenocarcinoma models , scored the highest . In addition , among 113 histological special types of breast cancer [ 14 ] , medullary , adenoid cystic and metaplastic tumors showed the lowest score in the differentiation axis ( Figure 4f ) , which is consis - tent with our previous reports of commonalities between metaplastic carcinomas , claudin - low tumors and breast cancer TICs [ 6 ] . Finally , we evaluated the prognostic ability of the differentiation predictor in the UNC337 and NKI295 breast cancer patient data sets . Low differentiation scores were statistically significantly associated with poorer RFS and OS in univariate ( Figure 5a ) and mul - tivariate analyses after adjusting for the main clinical - pathological parameters ( i . e . , size , grade , node and ER status ) , including tumor subtype ( Figure 5b ) . These data suggest that tumors with an undifferentiated phenotype similar to the normal MaSC and / or early progenitors have a poorer prognosis compared to tumors with a more mature luminal phenotype , and this association is independent of the luminal B and HER2 - enriched subtypes and the common clinical variables . Claudin - low and basal - like tumors are enriched with undifferentiated or mesenchymal cells Next , we sought to determine whether tumor cells with undifferentiated or mesenchymal features ( as defined by immunofluorescence ) exist within the different breast cancer intrinsic subtypes , similar to that performed by Creighton et al . [ 7 ] . Eighty - six breast tumors and one normal breast sample from the UNC337 database , including 20 claudin - low tumors , were evaluated using dual immunofluorescence ( IF ) staining with epithelial ( keratin 5 / 19 ) and mesenchymal ( vimentin ) markers . Staining of the normal breast sample revealed that the antibody to vimentin stains the mesenchyme or stroma , whereas the antibody to keratin 5 / 19 stains the ducts , and no dual positive cells were seen ( Figure 6 ) . Conver - sely , 33 % ( 28 of 86 ) of all tumor samples showed some degree of dual positivity , but 89 % ( 25 of 28 ) of all sam - ples with dual immunofluorescence positivity were either claudin - low ( n = 11 ) or basal - like ( n = 14 ) . The remaining dual positive samples were identified in the HER2 - enriched ( n = 1 ) and luminal A subtypes ( n = 2 ) . Claudin - low tumors showed higher percentages of dual positive tumors than the other tumor subtypes when these are considered as a group ( 55 % vs . 26 % ; P = 0 . 014 , c 2 test ) ; however , no statistically significant differences in dual positivity were observed between claudin - low and basal - like tumors ( 55 % vs . 78 % ; P = 0 . 14 , c 2 test ) . These data show that some epithelial tumor cells express mesenchymal features , these features are not due to contamination by adjacent stromal cells and almost all tumors with these features are basal - like or claudin - low tumors . We attempted to identify undifferentiated / mesenchy - mal epithelial cells within breast cancer cell lines . First , we analyzed the expression of surface markers CD49f and EpCAM ( chosen based upon the studies of Lim et al . [ 24 ] ) in three different cell lines : MCF - 7 ( luminal ) , SUM149PT ( basal - like ) and SUM159PT ( claudin - low ) ( Figure 7 ) . As expected on the basis of our previous genomic analysis of the differentiation status of these cell lines , virtually all claudin - low SUM159PT cells showed a stromal or MaSC antigenic phenotype ( CD49f + / EpCAM - ) , ~ 98 % of MCF - 7 cells showed a mL pheno - type ( CD49f - / low / EpCAM + ) , and ~ 83 % of SUM149PT cells showed a pL phenotype ( CD49f + / EpCAM + / high ) . About 10 % and ~ 2 % of cells from SUM149PT and MCF - 7 cell lines , respectively , showed low expression of EpCAM , suggesting that some cells within basal - like and luminal cell lines might have a more undifferen - tiated state . However , a clear EpCAM - / low subpopulation was identified only in the SUM149PT cell line . To further determine the differentiation status of the various cell subpopulations within MCF - 7 ( CD49f - / EpCAM + , CD49f + / EpCAM + , and CD49f - / low EpCAM - / low ) , Prat et al .

The EpCAM - / low cells derived from MCF - 7 or SUM149PT lines showed a statistically significant undifferentiated state when compared with their EpCAM + / high cell counter - parts ( Figure 7b ) ; however , for MCF - 7 cells , the EpCAM - / low cells still showed high differentiation scores .

Since both clau - din - low ( CD49f + / EpCAM - / low ) and basal - like ( CD49f + / high / EpCAM + ) cells exist within the SUM149PT cell line , we wished to determine whether one cell type gave rise to the other . When sorted and plated separately , 5 to 10 % of the CD49f + / EpCAM - / low SUM149PT cells differentiated into CD49f + / high / EpCAM + basal - like cells , whereas the CD49f + / high / EpCAM + basal - like cells maintained their dif - ferentiated status during in vitro culture ( Figure 7d ) . Discussion Here , claudin - low tumors were comprehensively charac - terized , and many important biological and clinical fea - tures were identified . Specifically , we addressed four topics for claudin - low tumors including ( 1 ) molecular features , ( 2 ) clinical and histological characteristics , ( 3 ) relation to established breast cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models and ( 4 ) differentia - tion status based on analyses of purified normal mam - mary epithelial cell subpopulations . Molecular characterization of the claudin - low sub - type reveals that these tumors are significantly enriched in EMT and stem cell - like features while showing a low expression of luminal and proliferation - associated genes . Among these molecular characteristics , EMT and stem cell features have recently been linked to one another [ 18 , 33 , 42 , 43 ] . Indeed , expression of EMT - indu - cing transcription factors SNAI1 [ 33 ] or TWIST1 [ 33 ] or repression of E - cadherin [ 43 ] in mammary epithelial cells increases the number of stem cells , and these and other EMT - inducing transcription factors such as ZEB2 and TWIST2 , as well as the mesenchymal marker vimentin , are expressed at higher levels in CD44 + CD24 - / low stem cell - like cells than in more dif - ferentiated epithelial CD44 - CD24 + cells [ 18 , 33 ] . Consis - tent with this finding , we observed a high mRNA expression of known transcriptional repressors of E - cadherin such as SNAI1 , SNAI2 , TWIST1 , TWIST2 , ZEB1 and ZEB2 , and other EMT - inducing factors such as hypoxia - inducible factor - 1a in claudin - low tumors [ 31 ] ( Figure 1b , Figure S2 in Additional file 1 ) . Thus , our data suggest that claudin - low tumors , compared with the other intrinsic breast tumor subtypes , are the most enriched for stem cell and / or TIC features , and on the basis of our vimentin immunofluorescence staining , it appears that these mesenchymal features are present within epithelial cells , which is a feature not seen in normal breast tissues . Acquisition of EMT and / or stem cell - like biological processes has been associated with therapeutic resis - tance [ 7 , 43 , 44 ] . We observed that claudin - low tumors do show a lower pCR rate than basal - like tumors ( Fig - ure 3a ) ; however , the pCR rate of claudin - low tumors was roughly equivalent to that of the HER2 - enriched subtype ( without anti - HER2 therapies ) and much higher than luminal A or luminal B tumors . Thus , as has been described for basal - like tumors [ 4 ] , claudin - low tumors show some chemotherapy sensitivity , yet patients with these tumors still have poor survival outcomes overall ( Figure 3b ) . A potential explanation for this similar sce - nario of basal - like and claudin - low tumors is that che - moresistant cells with TIC or mesenchymal properties are present at diagnosis in these two tumor subtypes as suggested by our immunofluorescence dual staining ( Figure S9 in Additional file 1 ) . This is also in concor - dance with a previous immunohistochemical study of 491 breast tumors where high expression of mesenchy - mal markers ( i . e . , vimentin , N - cadherin ) and low expres - sion of CDH1 were found almost exclusively in the triple - negative subgroup of tumors [ 45 ] . However , our treatment response data suggest that these tumor cells with mesenchymal properties within basal - like and clau - din - low subtypes might not have the same treatment sensitivity to anthracycline / taxane - based chemotherapy . Thus , further studies are needed to better characterize the treatment sensitivity of claudin - low and basal - like tumors to specific chemotherapeutics and / or targeted therapies . The claudin - low nine - cell line centroid pre - dictor developed here will assist immediately in identify - ing the claudin - low subtype and its possible predictive value in any neoadjuvant clinical trial with associated microarray data . However , we acknowledge a potential caveat of the nine - cell line claudin - low predictor , which is that tumors with high stromal content might also be identified as claudin - low . It is possible that the signature set of genes that are high in claudin - low tumors ( and cell lines ) are also high in nonepithelial cells , including fibroblasts and other mesenchyme - derived cells . Thus , we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the clau - din - low tumors identified in this study are tumors with low epithelial and high myofibroblast content . It is also possible that this signature is one that can occur within epithelial cells , within stromal cells , or both . Special attention to the percentage of tumor cellularity of the sample being analyzed and / or strategies that can differ - entiate tumor cells with mesenchymal properties ( i . e . , immunoflourescence assays ) from normal or tumor - associated fibroblasts with mesenchymal properties are needed for the further evaluation of this signature . Finally , from a translational point of view , it is interest - ing to note that the publicly available NCI - 60 in vitro drug - screening database includes six breast cancer cell Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 14 of 18 lines , four of which are claudin - low ( BT549 , MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 435 and Hs578T ) and two of which are luminal ( MCF - 7 and T47D ) . Among them , MDA - MB - 435 cells have been shown to have melanoma character - istics [ 46 ] , which is still a controversial topic [ 47 ] . Nonetheless , there is a need to develop better screening programs of drug sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines that resemble the basal - like subtype , as this subtype is missing from the NCI - 60 set . Invasive ductal , metaplastic and medullary or medul - lary - like claudin - low carcinomas share important biolo - gical relationships as defined by gene expression , suggesting that yet to be discovered common oncogenic changes might exist . Metaplastic and medullary carcino - mas both have a high incidence of methylation of BRCA1 [ 48 , 49 ] , and ~ 50 % of breast tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers show medullary - like features [ 50 ] . In addition , MDA - MB - 436 and SUM1315MO2 claudin - low cell lines have mutations in BRCA1 [ 51 ] . Moreover , we have shown that BRCA1 mutant basal - like SUM149PT cell line has a small subpopulation of cells with mesenchymal / claudin - low - like features , and that these cells give rise to the basal - like cells that domi - nate these cultures . These data suggest that BRCA1 defi - ciency , which has been implicated in the differentiation of MaSC or bipotent progenitors into ER - positive lumi - nal cells [ 52 ] , might also contribute to the development or progression of undifferentiated claudin - low tumors and cell lines . Although we have not performed functional tumor cell repopulating assays on human claudin - low tumors to show their enrichment for TICs because of the low incidence of these tumors ( i . e . , ~ 7 to 14 % ) , there is , however , evidence that the claudin - low cell lines identi - fied here show stem cell properties and may be highly enriched for TICs . For example , Charafe - Jauffret et al . [ 53 ] reported that in addition to having EMT features and high expression of stem cell markers such as ALDH1 , many of these cell lines contain functional TICs . This is in concordance with another report [ 54 ] that showed that MDA - MB - 231 , SUM159PT and SUM1315MO2 have a high proportion ( > 90 % ) of CD44 + / CD24 - / low cells , and that the CD44 + / CD24 - / low subpo - pulation obtained from these cell lines was capable of self - renewal , forming tumors in nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice , and were more resistant to chemotherapy . Lim et al . [ 24 ] delineated a human mammary epithe - lial hierarchy by performing cell sorting on the basis of two cell surface markers ( CD49f and EpCAM ) and a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments , including gene expression profiling of different subpopulations of the normal breast . Using their microarray data , we developed a genomic differentiation predictor that classifies breast tumors on the basis of their differentia - tion status along a continuous MaSC ® pL ® mL epithelial hierarchy . We observed that the information provided by the differentiation status adds prognostic value even when considered with intrinsic subtype and the classical clinical variables . However , as developmen - tal studies further characterize the normal mammary differentiation hierarchy , approaches such as the one reported here can be improved . For example , much less is known about other cell types in the normal breast , such as the myoepithelial progenitors and other poten - tial intermediate progenitors , which may be responsible for the development of other rare breast cancer subtypes such as medullary carcinomas . Finally , a similar genomic approach based on FACS data coming from other devel - opmental studies such as the ones by Lim et al . [ 24 ] or Raouf et al . [ 23 ] might prove useful in leukemia [ 55 ] or other solid tumors [ 56 ] , where similar differentiation hierarchies have been identified , and thus this differen - tiation predictor algorithm may show benefit in cancers other than breast cancer . Integration of the claudin - low tumor subtype together with the known intrinsic subtypes delineates a differen - tiation hierarchy that resembles the normal epithelial development . These data point to different cells of ori - gin for each intrinsic subtype , or different stages of developmental arrest for each subtype with a common cell type of transformation , or some combination of the two as different processes may be occurring for each dif - ferent subtype . Indeed , Lim et al . [ 24 ] suggested that the potential cell of origin of the basal - like subtype in BRCA1 carriers might be the pL instead of the MaSC . Alternatively , as suggested by our in vitro analyses of the SUM149PT cell line , BRCA1 - mutated basal - like tumors might arise from transformation of a MaSC that is similar to claudin - low tumors or cell lines , but the claudin - low tumors stay arrested in this undifferentiated state , while MaSC or claudin - low cells in basal - like tumors are able to divide asymmetrically and give off differentiated progeny that then arrest at the pL state [ 57 ] . The therapeutic implication of the claudin - low subtype will require additional retrospective and pro - spective evaluations , but what does appear clearer is that the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer may be reflective of distinct stages of mammary epithelial cell development and that the claudin - low tumors ( and cell lines ) show the least differentiated phenotype . Conclusions It has become appreciated that breast cancer is not one disease , but in fact represents multiple disease types , each of which may require a unique treatment . In this article , we characterize an important new disease group , namely the claudin - low subtype of breast cancer , and Prat et al . Breast Cancer Research 2010 , 12 : R68 http : / / breast - cancer - research . com / content / 12 / 5 / R68 Page 15 of 18 show that these tumors have a poor prognosis and fea - tures of mesenchymal and mammary stem cells . We also provide new tools for the identification and study of this subtype in tumors and cell lines .
