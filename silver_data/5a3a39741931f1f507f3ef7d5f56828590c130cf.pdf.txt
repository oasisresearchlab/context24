Review www . landesbioscience . com Cell Adhesion & Migration 1 Cell Adhesion & Migration 8 : 3 , 1 – 11 ; May - June 2014 ; © 2014 Landes Bioscience Review Preface Invadopodia are actin - based protrusions of the plasma membrane that penetrate into the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and enzymatically degrade it . 1 - 3 They belong to a family of structures , called invadosomes , 4 which facilitate cell invasion through tissues , a process that occurs under specific physi - ological conditions such as wound repair , pathogen infection , embryogenesis , and cell differentiation , as well as under patho - logical conditions such as cancer metastasis . 5 The first indication of invadosome family structures came in 1980 , when David - Pfeuty and Singer observed , in chicken embryo fibroblasts , the relocalization of vinculin and α - actinin from focal adhesions into circular “rosettes , ” following transfor - mation with Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) . 6 Five years later , these v - src induced structures were defined by Tarone and Marchisio as “podosomes” 7 , due to their foot - like morphology . Later , more of their structural and signaling components , such as actin , 8 fimbrin , 9 and the oncogenic v - src itself , 10 , 11 were identified , and RSV - induced podosomes were shown by Parsons et al . to be ECM contacts that also serve as sites of local matrix degrada - tion . 11 Their capacity to invade and degrade the ECM led Chen , in 1989 , to name these structures “invadopodia . ” 12 Chen and colleagues continued to characterize these structures , and dem - onstrated their dependence on metalloproteinase degradation activity , 12 tyrosine phosphorylation , 12 and matrix adhesion . 13 - 16 Similar adhesive and degradative structures were found in normal cells such as macrophages , 17 osteoclasts , 14 , 18 dendritic cells , 19 vascular smooth muscle cells , 20 and endothelial cells , 21 as well as in a wide variety of metastatic cancer cell lines such as breast carcinoma , 22 melanoma , 16 bladder carcinoma , 23 head and neck carcinoma , 24 prostate cancer , 25 and a variety of primary tumors . 26 Despite the overall similarity between invadopodia , podo - somes , and src - induced invadosomes , they do vary in their size , shape , density , and stability . 1 , 4 Under a fluorescent microscope , invadopodia of cultured cancer cells usually appear as dot - like structures , with an F - actin core , containing several actin - bind - ing proteins and signaling molecules . 2 , 5 The cores can be scat - tered or clustered at the cell center , usually in close proximity to the nucleus . 1 Podosomes , on the other hand , can be distributed in various fashions . They can be located throughout the cell in marcrophages , located at the cell periphery in smooth muscle cells , forming rosette - shaped clusters in endothelial cells , and in unique super - structures , such as sealing zones , in osteoclasts . 4 Src - induced invadosomes in fibroblasts display rosette - shaped peripheral invadosomes . 4 Invadopodia are long - lived , stable structures that last up to a few hours , 27 , 28 as opposed to podosomes , whose lifespans is in the order of few minutes . 5 The podosome actin core is sur - rounded by an adhesion ring containing plaque proteins such as vinculin , paxilin , and talin , 4 , 29 whereas the adhesion compo - nent of invadopodia is still poorly characterized . Invadopodia and podosomes also differ in their degree of penetration into the ECM : invadopodia were shown to penetrate deep into the matrix 30 and form filament - like processes , while podosomes display shallow appearance 4 and , fail to form long membrane protrusions . 31 Both podosomes and invadopodia degrade the ECM by local secretion of proteolytic enzymes ; as indicated , podosomes tend to degrade the exposed surface of the matrix , * Correspondence to : Benjamin Geiger ; Email : benny . geiger @ weizmann . ac . il Submitted : 11 / 21 / 2013 ; Revised : 01 / 12 / 2014 ; Accepted : 01 / 14 / 2014 http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 4161 / cam . 27842 The interplay between the proteolytic , invasive , and adhesive domains of invadopodia and their roles in cancer invasion Or - Yam Revach and Benjamin Geiger * Department of Molecular Cell Biology ; weizmann institute of Science ; Rehovot , israel Keywords : invadopodia , cancer metastasis , cell adhesion , invasion , metalloproteinases , cytoskeleton invadopodia are actin - based protrusions of the plasma membrane that penetrate into the extracellular matrix ( eCM ) , and enzymatically degrade it . invadopodia and podosomes , often referred to , collectively , as “invadosomes , ” are actin - based membrane protrusions that facilitate matrix remodel - ing and cell invasion across tissues , processes that occur under specific physiological conditions such as bone remodeling , as well as under pathological states such as bone , immune dis - orders , and cancer metastasis . in this review , we specifically focus on the functional architecture of invadopodia in cancer cells ; we discuss here three functional domains of invadopodia responsible for the metalloproteinase - based degradation of the eCM , the cytoskeleton - based mechanical penetration into the matrix , and the integrin adhesome - based adhesion to the eCM . we will describe the structural and molecular organiza - tion of each domain and the cross - talk between them during the invasion process . © 2012 Lande s B i o sc i en c e .

In podosomes of macrophages , the activation is not mediated by either one of the proteins . 32 This emphasizes the fact that while these structures are molecularly similar , and perform similar functions there might act via dif - ferent pathways . In this review , we will focus on the functional architecture of invadopodia in cancer cells , addressing the mechanisms under - lying the proteolytic and mechanical remodeling of the ECM by them . We will describe the structural and molecular organi - zation of invadopodia and the roles of the proteolytic domain , the invasive domain and the adhesive domain ( Fig . 1A and B ; Figure 1 .

The Proteolytic Domain ( Fig . 1A [ middle panel ] B ) . The matrix degradation capacity of invadopodia is attributed to a variety of proteases , belonging to the metalloproteinase ( MMPs ) , ADAM , and serine protease families . 1 , 5 , 33 , 34 Among these , the MMPs were shown to be the most functionally significant proteases associated with invado - podia activity in cancer cells . MMPs comprise a large family of zinc - dependent enzymes , both membrane - bound and soluble , 1 which are capable of cleaving multiple ECM proteins 35 . The membrane - bound form , MT1 - MMP ( or MMP14 ) , was shown to be not just an invasion - promoting component , but also a mas - ter regulator of invadopodia development , 33 , 36 whose recruit - ment promotes invadopodia maturation . 2 MT1 - MMP displays intrinsic collagenolytic activity , and can also cleave and activate some of the soluble MMPs . 34 , 37 Soluble MMP9 and MMP2 are secreted around invadopodia , and promote local ECM degra - dation . 16 , 35 - 41 Blocking MMP activity by inhibitors , antibodies , or siRNA impairs invadopodia function and matrix degrada - tion . 1 , 5 Furthermore , MMP inhibition also inhibits invadopodia formation , suggesting that MMPs regulate and fine - tune inva - dopodia function , at early stages of their formation . 2 , 5 The mechanisms where by proteases are recruited to sites of invadopodia remain unclear , and likely involve several recruit - ment pathways ( Fig . 1A and B ; proteolytic domain ) . These include vesicle trafficking along microtubules , which was demon - strated for MMP2 and MMP9 in melanoma cells . 42 MT1 - MMP is also regulated by clathrin - mediated and caveolar endocytosis ; 40 its recycling is suggested as a means of generating a membrane - active enzyme . 43 Polarized exocytosis and transport of vesicles of MT1 - MMP to sites of invadopodia is regulated by Rab8 GTPase in breast cell carcinoma . 44 In macrophages Rab5a , Rab8a , and Rab14 were shown to be important for MT1 - MMP polarized transport . 45 MT1 - MMP can be phosphorylated in a src - depended manner ; 46 and such phosphorylation was shown to promote clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 40 Exocytosis was also shown to be involved in MT1 - MMP regulation via IQGAP , a key regu - lator of cell polarity , which connects the actin cytoskeleton to microtubules . 47 Upon activation of RhoA and CDC42 , IQGAP is localized to invadopodia together with sec8 , a component of the exocytotic machinery ; together , they regulate the docking of MT1 - MMP vesicles to the plasma membrane . 48 Furthermore , the actin polymerization regulator cortactin was shown to partici - pate in the recruitment of MMPs to invadopodia , and regulate Figure 1 ( Opposite page ) . Mapping of the signaling cascades associated with the proteolytic , invasive , and adhesive domains of invadopodia . The pro - posed signaling and protein interaction cascades associated with the formation of invadopodia , their adhesion to the matrix , and their penetration into it . Key components involved in these processes , their upstream regulators and downstream targets are shown . Proteolytic domain : eCM degradation by invadopodia is attributed to the activation and function of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) . The membrane - bound form MT1 - MMP is the master regulator of the degradation process , together with the secreted proteases MMP9 and MMP2 . The synthesis and secretion of proteases is mediated by the eR and Golgi systems that deliver MMP - containing vesicles along microtubules . One of the central regulators of this process is src tyrosine kinase , which is activated upon receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) activation . Src phosphorylates MT1 - MMP and promotes its clathrin - mediated endocytosis and recycling , a process that promotes the transport of active MT1 - MMP to the plasma membrane . Other downstream effectors of the RTK signaling cas - cades are the small GTPases , Rho A and CDC42 , which can activate iQGAP interaction with sec8 , a component of the exocytosis machinery that further promotes the delivery of MT1 - MMP to the plasma membrane . Another mechanism for MT1 - MMP recruitment to invadopodia involves phosphorylated cortactin , in a mechanism that is src - and Arg kinase - dependent . As a master regulator , MT1 - MMP can also cleave and activate the secreted MMP9 and MMP2 . invasive domain : Assembly of an invasive actin network is induced by activation of RTKs ( e . g . , the eGF receptor ) , which leads to src and PKC kinase activation , as well as recruitment of adaptor molecules such as NCK1 . NCK1 binds to wiP ( wASP interacting protein ) and block its inhibitory interaction with N - wASP , thus enabling N - wASP binding to Arp 2 / 3 and activating actin nucleation . The Arp 2 / 3 complex can nucleate actin polymerization on existing filaments , forming a branched actin network . The Arp 2 / 3 actin nucleation activity is promoted by the serving activity of cofillin , which forms free barbed ends on existing actin filaments . in response to PKC kinase activation , phosphoinositides ( Pi ) are generated at the inner aspect of the plasma membrane of newly forming invadopodia . The adaptor protein TKS5 is recruited to the plasma membrane by binding to Pis , and is phosphorylated by src . The phosphorylated and membrane - associated TKS5 recruits cortactin that is also phosphorylated by src . in its unphosphorylated form , cortactin binds to cofilin , and inhibits it . Upon phosphorylation , cortactin detaches from cofilin , enabling it to sever actin filaments . Active cortactin facilitates both actin filament bundling and recruitment of MT1 - MMP ( see “proteolytic domain” ) . PKC can also activate the actin bundling protein fascin , which sta - bilizes the actin bundle . Adhesive domain : The adhesive domain of invadopodia is a ring - shaped structure associated with the periphery of the interface between the actin core bundle and the ventral plasma membrane ( see “invasive domain” ) . This domain assembles within seconds to minutes following core formation . The assumption is that the adhesion ring is molecularly similar to other types of integrin - mediated adhesions ( e . g . , focal adhesions ; see also Fig . 2 , white arrow ) . it is suggested that activation of integrins , upon binding to eCM ligands in invadopodia sites , induces the local recruitment of adhesion plaque proteins such as vinculin , paxillin , and Hic - 5 . iQGAP also localizes to the adhesion domain , and possibly interacts with the plaque proteins and facilitates the exocytosis of MT1 - MMP ( see “proteolytic domain” ) . ( B ) Organization of the different functional domains of invadopodia . A schematic representation of the structural organization of invadopodia domains ( cross - section ) is shown . each domain is denoted in different color . The proteolytic domain ( in orange ) includes the eR and Golgi systems , which produce protease - containing vesicles and transfer them to the invado - pod . Anchoring and secretion of MMP - containing vesicles are apparent in close proximity to the membrane ( see “proteolytic domain , ” Fig . 1A ) , as are recycling and exocytosis of the membrane - bound MT1 - MMP . The invasive domain ( in black ) is localized inside invadopodial protrusions into the eCM . This domain is composed of actin and actin - associated proteins ( see invasive domain Fig . 1A ) . The protein interactions within this domain lead to actin polymerization in a branched and parallel fashion . The polymerizing actin bundles generate forces that are applied on the eCM and push the ventral cell membrane toward it . Around the core , at the protrusion’s edges the adhesive domain is localized , anchored to the eCM via integrins , and associated adhesome cytoplasmic plaque proteins . This adhesion can mechanically support the invasive process . Most of the cross - talk between the three domains occurs upon recruitment of the various components to the plasma membrane , at the site of forming invadopodia . This cross - talk orchestrates the force generation mechanism which is applied to the matrix , together with mechanical stabilization by adhesion and matrix degradation , ultimately driving the invasion and migration of the cell into the matrix . © 2012 Lande s B i o sc i en c e . D o no t d i s t r i bu t e . 4 Cell Adhesion & Migration volume 8 issue 3 their secretion . 36 , 39 , 49 The adhesion machinery is also thought to play a role in invadopodia maturation and matrix degradation : β 1 integrin co - clusters with MT1 - MMP at sites of interaction with collagen fibers along the cell’s leading edge . 50 , 51 In addition , inhibition of integrin - mediated adhesion reduces recruitment of IQGAP to invadopodia , as well as matrix degradation . 52 A pos - sible mechanism for protease recruitment by β 1 integrin involves Arg kinase , which can phosphorylate cortactin on tyrosin 421 and promote matrix degradation . 53 Finally , dynamin 2 was shown to regulate the local matrix degradation in invadopodia , through proper localization and its GTPase activity . 54 , 55 Cancer cells are commonly associated with elevated levels of MMPs , whose expression is correlated with cancer aggressive - ness and poor prognosis . 40 , 56 Thus , studies of their activation and of mechanisms that could inhibit their activity are of great medical interest . Treating cancer with MMP inhibitors was con - sidered to be a very promising approach and was studied in a variety of clinical trials as therapy for various types of cancers . 57 - 59 Unfortunately , those trials were largely unsuccessful , most likely due to the development of drug resistance by the tumor cells , 60 secretion of MMP from stroma cells around the tumor , 61 lack of sufficient specificity of the inhibitors , and changes in the can - cer cell migration and invasion mechanism , capable of switching from proteolysis - dependent migration to amoeboid migration ( a so - called “mesenchymal – amoeboid transition” ) . 50 , 62 The failure of MMP inhibition to block cancer invasion indi - cates that the remodeling of the ECM per se is not sufficient for preventing cancer invasion and metastasis , and suggests that cell invasion into the matrix requires an active migratory pro - cess , whereby cancer cells “force their way” into the matrix . This mechanical penetration is primarily attributed to the invasive domain of invadopodia . The Invasive Domain General overview ( Fig . 1A [ right panel ] and B ) . Local matrix invasion , driven by invadopodia , is a highly coordinated process , whereby enzy - matic ECM degradation and mechanical cytoskeletal “pushing” occur at approximately the same time and in the same area , ulti - mately leading to effective penetration of the cell protrusion into the matrix . Considerable efforts were invested in characterizing the mechanical component of this process , which is believed to be driven primarily by actin polymerization , in a manner similar to the protrusive phase observed in the lamellipodia of migratory cells . 1 - 3 , 5 In this section , we will introduce the overall structure and assembly of the cytoskeletal machinery of invadopodia , and then discuss the specific contributions of each component to the overall process . The temporal sequence of events that eventually leads to inva - dopodia formation is not fully understood ; yet it has been pro - posed that this process is initiated by ligand - induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinases , such as the EGF receptor 28 , 63 ( Fig . 1A and B ) . This signaling event triggers the activation of c - src , 7 , 64 - 66 PKC isoforms , 67 - 70 and eventually , the adaptor protein TKS5 , 71 which plays a key role in early stages of the assembly of the actin machinery , TKS5 can then bind to Ptdlns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane , promoting the recruitment of actin regulators such as the SH2 / SH3 - containing , signaling adaptor protein NCK1 to the membrane . 2 The exact temporal sequence of these events is still not elu - cidated . A new approach of high - resolution spatiotemporal live cell imaging , published recently , shows that cortactin , N - WASP , cofilin , and actin arrive simultaneously to form the invadopodia precursor , while TKS5 is recruited later and is required for the structure stabilization . 72 Actin polymerization in the core of invadopodia is regulated by small Rho - family GTPases , mostly , CDC42 , 1 , 28 which can directly activate the N - WASP - WIP complex , which , in turn , drives actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex . 73 - 76 Arp 2 / 3 actin nucleation is promoted by the severing activity of cofil - lin . 77 - 79 Additional reports indicate that actin polymerization in invadopodia of certain cancer cells ( e . g . , MDA - 231 breast can - cer cell line ) can also be induced by specific Diaphanous - related formins , whose cell type specificity , and mode of action and regulation , are still unclear . 80 The actin bundle , thus formed , is further stabilized and mechanically reinforced by cortactin 5 and fascin , 73 , 81 , 82 producing a stable “invasive protrusion” that pushes against the ventral cell membrane , promoting its penetration into the ECM . 5 , 27 , 28 , 36 , 39 , 68 , 83 To get a closer look at the constituents of the invasive domain ( Fig . 1A and B ; invasive domain ) we summarized below the modes of action of the major proteins that are believed to partici - pate in invadopodia nanomechanics : ( 1 ) The adaptor protein N - WASP and its regulators were pre - viously shown to be an essential component of invadopodia . 28 , 84 N - WASP elimination reduced the ability of mammary adenocar - cinoma cells to form invadopodia , and metastasize . 26 N - WASP , together with WASP in hematopoietic cells and WAVE 1 – 3 , are major regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics . 26 Mutations in WASP are known to cause an X - linked inherited disease , Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome , characterized by immunodefi - ciency . WASP is negatively regulated by WASP - interacting pro - tein ( WIP ) , which is removed upon stimulation by upstream regulators such as NCK1 . 85 In invadopodia , N - WASP is a direct effector of CDC42 , 5 and is regulated by upstream signals from NCK , src , and phosphoinositides . 26 N - WASP is characterized by a C - terminal catalytic verprolin homology and a central acidic ( VCA ) domain , which mediate activation of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex . Activation of Arp 2 / 3 leads to actin polymerization , which generates the mechanical force that enables invadopodia to pen - etrate the ECM . 86 , 87 N - WASP was recently suggested to bind to barbed ends and accelerate actin assembly and polymerization in an Arp 2 / 3 - independent manner . 88 ( 2 ) The Arp2 / 3 complex drives the nucleation of a new actin filament that branches off an existing filament . 5 Arp2 / 3 is a 7 - sub - unit complex composed of Arp2 , Arp3 , and five additional sub - units ( ARPC1 – 5 89 ) . Arp2 / 3 is associated with invadopodia , and its knockdown by siRNA , or preventing N - WASP from binding to it , inhibits invadopodia formation . 27 , 28 The Arp2 / 3 complex , together with N - WASP , is upregulated in tumors and invading © 2012 Lande s B i o sc i en c e . D o no t d i s t r i bu t e . www . landesbioscience . com Cell Adhesion & Migration 5 cells . 90 , 91 Stabilization of the actin polymerization capacity of the Arp 2 / 3 complex is attributed to the binding of Arp 2 / 3 to both N - WASP and cortactin , the latter also binds to actin , and stabi - lizes the filament . 76 , 92 , 93 ( 3 ) Cortactin is a cytoskeletal , multi - domain protein that is important for the induction of actin polymerization . 30 , 63 , 94 Cortactin is ubiquitously expressed , and can be phosphory - lated by src kinase . 95 , 96 Cortactin phosphorylation was shown to be an Arg kinase - dependent process , triggered by EGFR activation , and leading to invadopodia maturation . 97 Tyrosin phosphorylation by src facilitates the response of cortactin to upstream signaling , including dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton . 98 Phosphorylation of Y421 , Y466 , and Y482 in the proline - rich domain is necessary for metastatic dissemina - tion of breast carcinoma cells , 99 while Y421 and Y466 , but not Y482 , are required for the generation of free barbed ends of actin filaments of invadopodia . 100 When phosphorylated , cor - tactin releases cofilin , and enables it to sever actin filaments , in order to form barbed ends that promote Arp 2 / 3 actin polym - erization . 77 , 92 , 101 Cortactin can also bridge between the Arp 2 / 3 complex and the actin bundle , due to its Arp 2 / 3 bind - ing N - terminal acidic domain , and thus , serves as an actin stabilizer . 102 Blocking cortactin activity by means of inhibi - tory antibodies , inhibition of src phosphorylation , or cortactin knockdown by siRNA , 68 block both the formation of invado - podia and matrix degradation . Interestingly , besides its role in the regulation of the actin machinery , cortactin is believed to directly connect the cytoskeletal components of invadopodia to the proteolytic machinery . 36 , 39 , 103 ( 4 ) Cofilin was shown to promote actin polymerization by its severing activity , which generates free barbed ends that induce the nucleation of actin polymerization by the Arp 2 / 3 com - plex . 5 , 77 - 79 Cofilin was shown to be important for invadopodia stabilization , most likely due to its interaction with cortactin ( see above ) and in its absence invadopodia become small and short - lived . 28 Cofilin severing activity is regulated and confined to invadopodia by RhoC and its upstream regulators p190RhoGEF and p190RhoGAP . 104 RhoC regulation on cofilin is mediated by regulation on cofilin phosphorylation through Rho - associated protein kinase and LIM - domain kinase . 79 , 104 ( 5 ) Fascin is an actin - bundling protein that cross - links actin filaments into a tightly packed bundle . 105 , 106 In humans , there are three members of the fascin family ( 1 – 3 ) , of which fascin 1 is the most widely expressed in tissues . 107 The actin bundling capacity of fascin is attributed to the actin - binding sites at its N - and C - termini , 108 , 109 and the bundling activity in invadopodia is specifically attributed to a PKC phosphrylation site at serine 39 . 81 Fascin is upregulated in cells localized at the invasive front of various invasive cancers . 110 , 111 Fascin is important for invado - podia elongation and actin filament stability , and its depletion was shown to reduce the ability of invadopodia to degrade the ECM . 81 , 83 ( 6 ) Other cytoskeletal systems , besides the actin network , namely , microtubules , and intermediate filaments , are believed to play either direct or indirect roles in invadopodia formation and function . Little is known about the specific mechanisms underly - ing the roles of microtubules and intermediate filaments in invadosomes in general , and particularly , in invadopodia of cancer cells . Nevertheless , intact microtubules are required for the function of other invadosomes , such as podosomes of monocytes , macrophages , and osteoclasts 1 , 112 , 113 . In breast can - cer cells , intact microtubules are not necessary for invadopo - dia formation , 114 , 115 but their destruction affects invadopodia elongation and maturation . 83 In melanoma cells , disruption of microtubules by inhibitory drugs causes invadopodia disassem - bly , inhibits their de novo formation , and consequently , reduces matrix degradation . 116 Previous studies also show that transport of proteins toward the leading edge of migrating fibroblasts requires intact , functioning microtubules , 117 a process that is thought to be important for the polarized transport of MMPs to invadopodia . 116 Intermediate filaments were shown to interact with actin fila - ments via fimbrin during the formation of podosomes in macro - phages . 118 Vimentin intermediate filaments are localized to newly formed podosomes of vascular smooth muscle cells , but are not directly necessary for their formation . In invadopodia , vimentin , but not cytokeratin , was shown to play a role in the invadopodia elongation . 83 To summarize , various proteins of the actin machinery work together in order to form a dense web of a dendritic actin net - work and long parallel bundles , which , together , apply mechani - cal force that pushes the plasma membrane toward and into the ECM . Other cytoskeletal elements ; namely , microtubules and intermediate filaments , are believed to affect the elongation stage of invadopodia ; but their specific roles are yet to be explored . The mechanical force generated by actin polymerization plays a key role in invadopodia protrusive action , but several mechanis - tic questions still remain open : Is inavdopodia protrusive activity sufficient for driving the entire process of cell invasion ? What prevents a protrusion from retracting ? What mechanisms coordi - nate , spatially , tumor cell “proteolytic invasion” and migration ? What keeps the actin network from extending deep into the cyto - plasm rather than pushing the plasma membrane ? The Adhesive Domain ( Fig . 1A [ left panel ] and B ) . Tissue cells grow and function in tight association with diverse components of the ECM . These adhesive interactions play a central role in tissue morphogene - sis and remodeling , as well as in physiological and pathological cell migration . Cells connect their cytoskeleton to ECM com - ponents via a variety of specialized transmembranal receptors , the most common of which are the heterodimeric integrins . 119 Integrins interact with the ECM components via their extracel - lular domains , and are connected to the actin cytoskeleton via their cytoplasmic tails , and a multi - protein complex of adaptor , scaffold , and signaling proteins , known collectively as the inte - grin adhesome . 120 , 121 In addition to their mechanical role , integ - rin adhesions to the ECM act as “multi - sensory” sites , enabling cells to “scan” the ECM , and respond to its chemical - molecular © 2012 Lande s B i o sc i en c e . D o no t d i s t r i bu t e . 6 Cell Adhesion & Migration volume 8 issue 3 properties , as well its physical characteristics , including rigidity , stretching , 122 - 125 and topography of the ECM . 126 - 130 It is commonly accepted that the spatiotemporally regu - lated coupling between protrusive processes and the establish - ment of nearby adhesions is essential for cell locomotion and invasion . 63 , 131 , 132 During the migration process , for example , the forward extension of lamellipodia or filopodia , driven by local actin polymerization , is guaranteed by the presence of focal adhesions or focal complexes at the posterior aspects of these protrusions . 131 , 133 Do matrix adhesions play an essential role in ECM invasion by invadopodia , or is this process primarily driven by MMPs that locally degrade the matrix ? Over the years , researchers have addressed this question , yet information about the adhesive domain of invadopodia , its molecular composition , and its struc - ture , remains scarce . Previous studies suggest that invadopodia of cancer cells lack a distinct adhesive capacity , unlike podosomes , which contain a conspicuous adhesive ring . 3 , 4 It is noteworthy that podosomes , have typical lifetimes on the order of a few min - utes , while invadopodia can be stable for hours . 1 More recently , these claims were challenged by the detection of vinculin , paxil - lin , and Hic - 5 in rings located at the periphery of newly formed invadopodia in various cultured cancer cell lines 52 , 134 ( and our unpublished data Fig . 2 ) . It is likely that this apparent discrep - ancy is attributable to differences between the cancer cell lines , or to variations in the persistence of the adhesion rings during the lifespan of the invadopodia . In fact , it was reported that the adhesive domain of invadopodia is formed soon after the forma - tion of the core F - actin bundle , showing an oscillatory behavior , and occasionally , disappears at later stages , after stabilization of the structure 52 , 72 ( and our unpublished data ) . The mechanisms underlying the interplay between the core and the adhesion ring , and their significance for ECM remodeling , are still poorly understood . Nevertheless , it was shown that integrin - mediated adhesion regulates invadopodia formation by activation of Rho GTPase family members and various kinases , together with recruitment of adhesion molecules 53 , 135 , 136 ( Fig . 1A and B ; adhesive domain ) . Several integrins were shown to be associated with invadopodia , including α 6 β 1 in melanoma 135 , 136 and α 3 β 1 in breast cancer cells , 53 , 137 suggesting that the association of integrins with inva - dopodia is tissue - specific . Within the adhesion sites , integrins are believed to bind and activate metalloproteases , besides their “classical” signaling and scaffolding functions . Blocking of inte - grin - mediated adhesion by soluble RGD peptides or inhibitory antibodies results in reduced matrix degradation , and less local - ization of MT1 – MMP to invadopodia sites . 52 Integrins are not the only players in the adhesive domain of invadopodia . In order to form stable adhesions with the ECM and link them to the cytoskeleton , various components of the integrin adhesome , including scaffolding and signaling mol - ecules , are recruited to the adhesion site . 138 - 141 For example , the adaptor protein paxillin 142 is tyrosine - phosphorylated , and can form a complex with PKC μ and cortactin in invadopodia . 68 Hic - 5 , a member of the paxillin family , localizes to invadopodia rings , and upon TGF β stimulation , promotes ECM degradation in a src phosphorylation - dependent manner . 134 The role of Focal Adhesion Kinase in invadopodia regulation is rather controver - sial ; it was shown to function as a negative regulator of invado - podia through the spatial control of src in MTLn3 mammary adenocarcinoma cells , 143 While other reports indicate that it is localized to invadopodia , and its increased expression promotes the formation of src - induced invadopodia . 144 VASP , another adhesome component , accumulates at the degradation sites of invadopodia in MDA - 231 breast cancer cells 83 and its phosphor - ylation on Ser239 was reported to suppress invadopodia forma - tion , and inhibit the formation of cancer metastasis . 145 Like other adhesion structures , invadopodia are highly regu - lated by the chemical and physical properties of the ECM . Matrix rigidity directly increases both the number and activity of inva - dopodia . This mechanosensing is regulated by the contractile machinery of the cells ( e . g , myosin II and Rho kinase ) . 146 Matrix organization can also affect invadopodia shape . For example , tumor cells cultured on a fibrillar collagen I matrix form linear F - actin structures , which share features with conventional inva - dosomes , and are capable of degrading the matrix . 147 To date , it is not clear which adhesion proteins participate in formation of the ring in periphery of the invadopodia core . Are they all co localized in the ring , both spatially and temporally , or are there differential kinetics and localization for each protein , as reported for focal adhesions ? 148 , 149 Blocking of integrin - mediated adhesion didn’t block invadopodia formation ; yet , it reduced the extent of matrix degradation . 52 These and other results raise many Figure 2 .

Cells were fixed and stained for TKS5 , an invadopodia core marker , and vinculin , a marker for integrin adhesions . The adhesion ring ( shown enlarged in the upper - right corner ) is associated with the invadopodia core at early stages ( within minutes ) of invadopodia formation , and often disappears at later stages ( hours ) . Stable focal adhesions ( FAs ) , located mainly at the cell’s periphery , are also formed in these cells . © 2012 Lande s B i o sc i en c e . D o no t d i s t r i bu t e . www . landesbioscience . com Cell Adhesion & Migration 7 questions about the role of the adhesive domain in recruitment of the degradation machinery , and the cross - talk between them . Which of the adhesion components are important for invadopo - dia formation and function ? Why do they appear primarily at the early stages of the invadopodia formation ? Are there other roles for the adhesion molecules in the invasion process ? Does adhe - sion to the ECM stabilize invadopodia mechanically ? Are there differences between the adhesion mechanism , structure , and dynamics in 2D vs . 3D matrices ? What is the interplay between the adhesive domain , and other cytoskeletal components ? An Integrated View of Invadopodia’s Functional Architecture In this article , we attempted to review the structure – function relationships in invadopodia , focusing on structures that carry out specific functions in driving cell invasion , which distinguish them from other types of cellular protrusions ( e . g . , filopodia or lamelli - podia ) or other adhesion sites ( e . g . , focal adhesions or podosomes ) . Unique to invadopodia is the spatial and temporal coordination of invasion , adhesion , and matrix degradation . Each of these three processes is regulated and executed by a set of multiple proteins that can be define as a “functional domain , ” the spatial organiza - tion of which is schematically depicted in Figure 1B . The overall “mission” of invadopodia is the promotion of cell migration across connective tissue barriers ( commonly practiced by metastatic cancer cells ) , as opposed to locomotion along spe - cific , pre - existing migration tracks ( as physiologically occurs during organogenesis and embryogenesis ) . The special property of these three functional domains of invadopodia is their spatial organization and temporal coordination , which enables them to act in concert , in what might be described as a coherent “grip - soften - push” mechanism . Such tactics require fine - tuned cross - talk between the proteolytic ( enzymatic ) , invasive ( cytoskeletal ) , and adhesive domains . According to this view , the cell utilizes its integrin adhesion machinery to probe the ECM and bind to it ( the “grip” step ) . Upon appropriate stimulation , global or local , actin nucleation is initiated at the cytoplasmic aspects of these adhesions , forming an initial actin core . Subsequently , the proteolytic domain is activated , presenting MT1 - MMP on the ventral cell surface , and releasing MMP2 and MMP9 . Focal degradation of the matrix by MT1 - MMP , and broader degradation by the soluble proteases , reduces matrix barriers under and around invadopodia ( the “softening” step ) , conditioning these areas for the penetration step . Naturally , ECM degradation can also affect nearby adhesion to the matrix by remodeling the ECM , which may explain the observation that not all invadopodia are associated with adhesion rings . Next , rigor - ous actin polymerization in the core of the invasive domain pushes against the plasma membrane , driving the penetration into the “softened” matrix ( the “push” step ) . Repeated cycles of this “grip - soften - push” by multiple invadopodia could effectively constitute the mechanism underlying invadopodia - mediated cell invasion . Recent evidence for repeating cycles of protrusion and retraction of invadopodia was indeed described . 150 The three functional domains of invadopodia , which are discussed above , are in fact , packed into one coherent struc - ture presented in the transmission electron micrograph , shown in Figure 3 . Transmission electron micrographs of invadopodia were shown previously in several cell types . 33 , 54 , 83 In the ultra - thin section shown here , cut perpendicular to the plane of the gelatin matrix , a single invadopod is seen , pushing against the gelatin layer and apparently compressing or degrading it . The invadopod itself is packed with F - actin fibers , and is devoid of cytoplasmic organelles . Microtubules are often detected at the periphery of the core actin bundle ( indicated by the arrow in Fig . 3 ) . Interestingly , the gelatin layer at the peripheral aspect of the invadopod is slightly thicker , in line with the possibility that this region correspond to the adhesion ring . Naturally , invadopo - dia formed by cultured cells , growing on thin ECM , are rather shallow structures compared with their in vivo counterparts , yet the general distributions of their functional / structural domains might be quite similar . It should be acknowledged that despite our vast information about invadopodia , their structure , and their physiological roles , we are still left with many basic , as yet unanswered questions concerning their coordinated action . To mention a few : are there special features of the ECM ( composition , rigidity , topography ) that contribute to the assembly and activation of the different domains of invadopodia ? How does MMP enzymatic activity affect invadopodia formation , adhesion , and mechanics ? How is the timing of the different phases in the “invasion cycle” Figure 3 . imaging of invadopodia by electron microscopy : A375 , human metastatic melanoma cells were cultured for 2h on glass - bottom dishes , coated with cross - linked gelatin . Cells were fixed ( 3 % paraformaldehyde , 2 % glutaraldehyde , 5 mM CaCl 2 ) in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 1h , washed , and post - fixed with 1 % OsO 4 . Samples were washed again with 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer and stained with 2 % aqueous uranyl ace - tate ( eMS ) for 1h , dehydrated , and embedded in epon . Ultrathin sections were then cut and examined in an Fei Tecnai™ Spirit T12 transmission electron microscope . in this electron micrograph actin filaments are apparent throughout the core of the invadopodial protrusion , exclud - ing other cytoplasmic structures ( e . g . , ribosomes ) from the core area . The ventral membrane at the invadopode area is in close contact with the glass and the gelatin layer is cleared . © 2012 Lande s B i o sc i en c e .
