CITATION FREQUENCY AND THE VALUE OF PATENTED INVENTIONS Dietmar Harhoff , Francis Narin , F . M . Scherer , and Katrin Vopel * Abstract —Through a survey , private economic value estimates were obtained on 964 inventions made in the United States and Germany and on which German patent renewal fees were paid to full - term expiration in 1995 . A search of subsequent U . S . and German patents yielded counts of citations to those patents . Patents renewed to full - term were signiﬁcantly more highly cited than patents allowed to expire before their full term . The higher an invention’s economic value estimate was , the more the patent was subsequently cited . I . Introduction T HE availability of rich machine - readable data sets has led during the past decade to considerable use of patent citations as an instrument for measuring the impact and ﬁne structure of technological innovations . Through citation counts , it is argued , one can achieve a better approximation to the economic value of inventive activity than using only unweighted patent counts or data on research and develop - ment expenditures . Tapping unique survey data on indi - vidual patents , this paper tests whether more valuable patents are in fact more extensively cited . II . Citations as a Measuring Instrument When an invention patent is issued by government patent offices , its text normally includes citations to prior patents ( and also to relevant prior scientiﬁc and technological literature ) . To be patentable , an invention must be novel , i . e . , not anticipated in the already practiced state of the art . Citations placed in the patent text , usually by either the inventor’s attorneys or by patent office examiners ( depend - ing upon national practice ) , serve to show how the claimed invention differs from the ‘‘prior art’’and hence to help stake out the metes and bounds of the new claims . In a sense , citations identify the shoulders upon which the new claims stand in their attempt to advance technology . Given this , patent citations can serve as measures of economic value in two quite different ways ( Griliches , 1990 , pp . 1688 – 1689 ) . For one , it is reasonable to suppose that the prior inventions cited in new patents tend to be the relatively important precursors that best deﬁne the state of the art . The broader the shoulders , the more likely they are to be cited . From this follows the hypothesis to be tested here—that patents of relatively high economic value are cited more frequently than are low - value patents . This measurement approach is analogous to using journal article citation counts to identify scholars whose research has been particularly seminal and to assess the quality of the institutions where they are employed . 1 Second , because prior inventions set the stage for new inventions , citations are used to measure a potentially important economic externality , i . e . , the impact the knowl - edge embodied in prior inventions has in stimulating new contributions . See , for example , Caballero and Jaffe ( 1993 ) , Jaffe et al . ( 1998 ) , and the survey by Jaffe ( 1998 ) . Our research here emphasizes the ﬁrst of these measure - ment approaches , hypothesizing that more valuable patents are more frequently cited . In this , it builds upon Trajtenberg ( 1990 ) —who found that medical diagnostic imaging patents of greater social value were more - frequently cited—and Hall et al . ( 1998 ) , whose preliminary results suggest that companies with more frequently cited patents have higher stock market values , other relevant variables held equal . Unlike Trajtenberg , we focus on the private value of our survey patents and their underlying inventions to patent holders , not on their social value ( including positive exter - nalities ) . III . The Surveys The sampling approach underlying our analysis was based upon two phenomena identiﬁed in earlier work with patents . See , for example , Lanjouw et al . ( 1996 ) . First , many nations require patent holders to pay periodic renewal or maintenance fees to keep their patents in force . The longer fees are paid , the higher a patent’s implied value is . Second , inventions originating in one national jurisdiction are in a sizeable fraction of cases also patented in other nations . The greater the invention’s anticipated value , the more likely patenting abroad is . To exploit these two properties , we focused on German patents resulting from applications ﬁled in 1977 , and hence with a full - term expiration date ( given the eighteen - year life span prevailing at that time ) falling within 1995 . 2 Germany was chosen because it is one of the leading industrialized nations , because its patent examination system is particu - larly rigorous , and especially because its patent renewal - fee system is one of the most progressive in the world . Fees keeping a patent in force rose from DM 50 for the third year to DM 2 , 700 for the eighteenth year , cumulating to DM 16 , 075 ( $ 8 , 856 at average 1980 exchange rates ) over the statutory eighteen - year life . From 57 , 782 applications in the 1977 cohort , 22 , 898 patents were issued and not subse - quently revoked . Of these , 4 , 349 ( 19 % ) were renewed to full - term expiration in 1995 . The samples analyzed here began with 1 , 431 full - term German patents issued to residents of Germany ( mostly to companies operating in Germany , but also to a few indepen - dent inventors ) and 900 full - term German patents issued to Received for publication September 24 , 1997 . Revision accepted for publication October 27 , 1998 . * University of Munich , CHI Research Inc . , Harvard University , and Center for European Economic Research , Mannheim , respectively . 1 For a survey of the extensive literature pursuing this approach , see Medoff ( 1996 ) . 2 The maximum patent life was increased from eighteen to twenty years beginning with 1978 priority applications . The Review of Economics and Statistics , August 1999 , 81 ( 3 ) : 511 – 515 r 1999 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology U . S . residents . Telephonic contacts were achieved in Ger - many with the holders of 1 , 352 patents from German - resident inventors . To form the U . S . sample , an attempt was made to link the German patents back to counterpart U . S . patents . Attrition occurred because not all German patents disclosed prior U . S . applications , 3 because the U . S . entities holding a single full - term German patent were included in the linking effort only when there was reason to believe they could be located , 4 and because only 61 % of the remaining U . S . applications were successful in yielding U . S . patents . Thus , the starting point of the U . S . survey comprised 485 parallel and linked U . S . patents . Each surveyed patent owner was contacted by telephone and facsimile during 1996 ( the year following patent expira - tion ) and asked to answer a single counterfactual question , which , in the U . S . survey version , was phrased as follows : If in 1980 you knew what you now know about the proﬁt history of the invention abstracted here , what is the smallest amount for which you would have been willing to sell this patent to an independent third party , assuming that you had a bona ﬁde offer to purchase and that the buyer would subsequently exercise its full patent rights ? This asset - value approach ( consistent with the view of patents as intellectual property ) was chosen following pilot interviews over a question asking for the accumulated ﬂow of proﬁts . Because selling full rights meant that the patent holder could be enjoined from using that invention or forced to pay royalties reﬂecting the invention’s value , the survey responses elicited a private value that corresponds most closely to the discounted present value of proﬁts that would be foregone by not having the invention and its accompany - ing patent protection . Respondents in the German survey were asked to locate their patent’s value within ﬁve categories ranging from ‘‘less than DM 100 , 000’’ ( $ 55 , 000 at 1980 exchange rates ) to ‘‘more than DM 5 million’’ ( $ 2 . 75 million ) . Electronic contacts were supplemented by face - to - face interviews for 69 German patents valued at more than DM 5 million . U . S . respondents , contacted ﬁrst by telephone and then by facsimile or mail , were given a broader range of eight categories , from ‘‘less than $ 100 , 000’’ to ‘‘more than $ 100 million . ’’ Altogether , there were 772 useable responses covering the inventions of German origin and 192 usable responses in the survey of U . S . patents . 5 The value distribu - tion of responses was highly skewed . Among the German patents , 12 . 9 % occupied the highest value category . Among the linked U . S . patents ( thrice winnowed—once for yielding a U . S . patent , again for yielding a German patent , and a third time for being renewed to full term in Germany ) , 18 ( 9 . 4 % ) were placed in the ‘‘above $ 100 million’’ category . Statisti - cal distribution properties of the survey responses are analyzed by Harhoff et al . ( 1997 ) . IV . U . S . Patent Citation Link Results A search of citations to the 192 U . S . sample patents contained in other U . S . patents subsequently issued ( i . e . , between 1978 and 1996 ) was made using the extensive database of CHI Research , Inc . ( See , for example , Narin ( 1995 ) . ) The number of recorded citations ranged from zero ( nine cases ) to 169 , with a mean of 15 . 91 , median of 9 . 0 , and standard deviation of 20 . 83 . The average number of citations to all U . S . patents issued to U . S . corporations , weighted by issue year counts of patents in our sample , was 6 . 83 . ( Citation rates to patents held by independent inventors and foreign corporations were lower . Universe citation counts were approximately 15 % higher on average in the U . S . Patent Office classiﬁcation groups into which our sample fell than in the citation universe generally . ) With or without an adjustment for sample composition , the differences between mean citation ratios for our sample and weighted universe means are signiﬁcant at the 0 . 001 level . Thus , U . S . patents selected on the basis of full - term German counterpart renewal are substantially more frequently cited than run - of - the - mill patents . Figure 1 displays average citation frequencies for the eight economic value groups into which respondents classi - ﬁed their patents , with the number of observations per group recorded in parentheses . In every value group , the average citation frequency for full - term German counterpart patents exceeds the weighted universe average of 6 . 83 . Within our full - term sample , two broad groupings appear . The most proﬁtable patents—those valued at $ 20 million or more— are visibly more highly cited than less - valuable patents , i . e . , 29 . 6 citations on average for the former , compared to 13 . 1 for the latter . An F - ratio test reveals the two groups to be signiﬁcantly different ; F ( 1 , 190 ) 5 18 . 66 . A less - structured test for differences among the eight classes is also highly signiﬁcant ; F ( 7 , 184 ) 5 3 . 12 . Although the group citation averages in ﬁgure 1 do not rise monotonically with estimated patent value , regression analysis of the number of citations ( in natural logarithms ) on 3 When one seeks patents both at home and abroad , it is customary to ﬁle ﬁrst at home , disclosing the home application serial number to the foreign patent office as part of establishing the legal date on which priority of invention occurs . Foreign patents then cite the home application serial number when it is available . 4 Lost by this last criterion were independent inventors and ﬁrms without publicly traded securities located outside the New England area and patents issued to ﬁrms that disappeared by merger or other corporate control transactions . 5 Of the 222 U . S . patents analyzed elsewhere by the authors , 20 U . S . patents could not be included in the analysis here because a large corporate respondent provided for the sake of conﬁdentiality only a size distribution of patent values detached from individual patent numbers , and ten replies arrived too late . Attrition between the original linked sample of 485 and the 222 with usable replies occurred mainly because of company decisions not to participate , but also because some patents went to sold - off company divisions or individuals and could not be traced to knowledgeable respondents . 512 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS survey value estimates ( also in natural logarithms ) supports the existence of a generally positive relationship . 6 Six of the eight value groups were assigned values equal to the geometric mean of their bounds ; the mean value of the most valuable patents was estimated ( on the basis of telephonic interviews ) to be $ 250 million ; and the mean of the least valuable patents was assumed to be $ 50 , 000 . The regres - sions , with and without dummy variables controlling for the eight main classes of the International Patent Classiﬁcation ( IPC ) , are presented in table 1 . 7 ( Standard errors are enclosed in parentheses . ) In OLS regressions , zero values of the citation count dependent variable are assumed to be 0 . 3 . Negative binomial regressions avoid this arbitrary zero - value convention and also permit closer comparison with later German patent results . In all cases , the economic value coefficients ( interpretable as elasticities ) are statistically signiﬁcant , with t - ratios of 3 . 6 or higher . 8 The relationships exhibit strongly diminishing returns . In regression 1a , for example , patents valued in 1980 at $ 1 million elicited 7 . 97 predicted citations on average ( with a two standard error range of from 0 . 7 to 90 citations ) ; patents valued at $ 10 million , 10 . 49 citations ; and patents valued at $ 100 million , 13 . 70 citations ( with a two - sigma range of 1 . 2 to 156 ) . Among the seven dummy variables , only the coefficient for the international patent class corresponding approximately to the scientiﬁc and professional instruments sector was statistically signiﬁcant , with a positive sign . 9 The relatively low R 2 values for all regressions and the wide conﬁdence bounds reveal that the citation - value rela - tionship is quite noisy . To the extent that errors in both the citation and value observations are random , pooling of observations to the ﬁrm level can enhance explanatory power and reduce errors - in - variables biases . For 43 compa - nies holding in total 139 of the 192 sample patents , the survey responses were complete , covering all U . S . patents linked to full - term German patents , and , in addition , it was possible to obtain data on total company - ﬁnanced research and development outlays in 1976 ( the year before German applications were ﬁled ) . 10 The analogue of regression 1a in table 1 for those 43 companies is : Ln CITES 5 2 . 62 1 0 . 314 ln VALUE ; r s 5 0 . 413 , ( 0 . 22 ) ( . 058 ) ( 1 ) with standard errors reported in subscripted parentheses . The increases in the estimated elasticity and r 2 relative to table 1 suggest that some averaging - out of random errors has occurred . It is conceivable that the amount of R & D funds expended by a company contributes to the technological quality ( and hence citation - attracting power ) of its patents independently of the patents’ economic value . A second variable , RDPAT , measuring 1976 R & D expenditures per linked patent , was therefore added to regression ( 1 ) , yielding : 6 Our maintained hypothesis is that more valuable patents elicit more subsequent citations ; thus , value is the appropriate righthand - side variable . Referees interested in using citations as a predictor of value suggested the reverse formulation . With either formulation , the righthand - side variable is measured with error—for monetary values , because survey responses are imperfect and available only in eight groups ; and for citations , because choices by patent agents and / or examiners of which prior patents to cite have substantial random components . In either case , regression coeffi - cients are likely to be biased downward . 7 The International Patent Classiﬁcation groupings are roughly ( A ) food , shelter , and clothing ; ( B ) production processes and transportation ; ( C ) chemicals ( including drugs ) ; ( D ) textiles and paper ; ( E ) construction and mining ; ( F ) machinery , machine elements , heating , cooling , and weapons ; ( G ) instruments and control devices and atomic energy ; and ( H ) electrical and electronic equipment . 8 A referee suggested that by conﬁning the regression analysis to full - term patents , we limit the variance of patent values and hence the strength of value - citation relationships . This is true , but what is selected out is mainly the great mass of low - value patents . Among the full - term survivors , there remain value variations spanning at least four orders of magnitude . 9 In the U . S . citation universe , patents with that IPC code also had unusually high citation frequencies . 10 The patents linked to full - term German patents of those companies comprised only approximately 2 . 5 % of all the patents issued in 1978 to the same companies . R & D cost was of course incurred to generate the nonlinked patents , which undoubtedly contributed to company proﬁts . Thus , the value estimates are biased downward . F IGURE 1 . —U . S .

Thus , R & D outlays appear to have no independent explanatory power once private economic value is taken into account . V . German Patent Citation Link Results Using the databanks of the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems Technology and Innovation Research in Karlsruhe , Germany , a similar link was effected between full - term patents issued to German residents on which economic value estimates were obtained through facsimile and interview methods and the German patent citations to those patents . As with the linked U . S . data , the German patent values had a highly skewed distribution that most closely approached the log normal ( Harhoff et al . , 1997 ) . Successful citation links were achieved for all 772 of the patents on which German survey responses were secured . A tally of citation counts was also made for all 10 , 780 German patents issued to German residents on the basis of 1977 applications , including the 1 , 431 patents renewed to full term . This research yielded the initially surprising ﬁnding that German patents cite prior German patents much less frequently than U . S . patents cite prior U . S . patents . For the universe of all German patents with 1977 application dates issued to German residents , the average number of subse - quent citations was 0 . 504 per patent ( compared to more than six for corresponding U . S . patents ) . The maximum number of recorded citations was 15 ; 69 . 5 % of the 10 , 780 German universe patents received no citations at all . The difference in citation rates between Germany and the United States is attributable in part to the much larger size of the U . S . patent base . During the 1980s , there were roughly four times as many U . S . patents as German patents to cite any given prior patent . In addition , there are material differences in patent laws and practice . 11 In the United States , patent applicants are required to list relevant prior patents . This is not mandated under German or European Patent Office practice ; citations are introduced mainly by patent office examiners . In the United States , examiners may add to or delete the applicant’s citations , but the tendency of both parties is toward comprehensive referencing to high - light an invention’s multiple facets . In the German and European patent offices , examiners must conﬁne their cita - tions to prior patents essential in evaluating an invention’s claim of novelty . The consequence is a lower citation rate in Europe , with all else equal . 12 Patents renewed to full term were more likely to be cited and had more citations on average than patents allowed to lapse before their maximum eighteen - year term . The aver - age number of citations per full - term patent was 0 . 732 , 47 % more than the nonfull - term German resident cohort average of 0 . 470 . The difference in means is highly signiﬁcant , with t 5 9 . 14 . The full - term patents on which economic value estimates were obtained through our German survey had 0 . 703 citations on average . The difference between survey and non - full - term patents is again highly signiﬁcant ( t 5 6 . 52 ) . 13 Among the full - term ( survey ) patents , 61 . 7 % ( 60 . 4 % ) had zero citations , compared to 70 . 7 % for the non - full - term cohort . In a binomial proportions test , the difference is signiﬁcant at better than the 0 . 01 level . 14 Figure 2 displays the average citation frequencies ( includ - ing zero - citation cases ) for survey response patents grouped by their estimated economic value . For patents originally valued at more than DM 5 million , ﬁner disaggregations from subsequent interviews are used . Also shown is the average for nonfull - term cohort patents . The two most 11 This interpretation is based upon discussion with Bernd Bettels of the European Patent Office , The Hague , and a communication from him to Francis Narin . 12 Because the applicant contributes less to generating citations , citation counts may be less useful as indicators of technological spillovers for European patents than for American patents . 13 When average citation rates for non - full - term patents in speciﬁc International Patent Classiﬁcation categories were weighted to reﬂect the composition of our survey sample , the adjusted measure ( 0 . 478 citations ) was virtually identical to the unweighted universe total . 14 Four of the eight universe patents with ten or more citations had been renewed to full term , and hence were included in our survey frame , but their owners chose not to participate in the survey . From inspection of those patents , there is reason to believe that appreciable economic values would have been reported . Among the total of 659 full - term patents on which no response was obtained , 63 . 3 % had zero citations , compared to 60 . 4 % for responding patents . The difference is not statistically signiﬁcant in a binomial test ; t 5 1 . 13 . The mean number of citations conditional upon nonzero citation was 2 . 083 for nonresponding patents and 1 . 775 for responding patents , with a t - ratio of 4 . 32 in a test of mean differences . In a test of unconditional means , t 5 1 . 67 . Thus , the responding and nonrespond - ing samples were different , but mainly with respect to citation rates for the highly cited patents . In a probit analysis of survey participation by full - term patent holders , the number of citations did not have signiﬁcant explanatory power at the 0 . 10 level , but response rates were signiﬁcantly related to differences in International Patent Classiﬁcation categories . F IGURE 2 . —G ERMAN P ATENT C ITATION F REQUENCIES BY V ALUE G ROUP 514 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS valuable inventions are grouped together for reasons of conﬁdentiality ; disaggregation would not change the impli - cations . As with the U . S . patents , early - expiration universe patents are less cited than all but the least valuable full - term patents . By far the highest citation frequencies are for the two patents with the greatest reported economic value . This visual implication is conﬁrmed by regression analy - sis of individual patent citation counts on reported economic values . Due to the high incidence of zero values and the low citation counts , ordinary least squares regression is inappro - priate . Poisson regression is also ruled out , since the variance of the citation counts is roughly twice the mean count . Therefore , a negative binomial formulation is used , with economic VALUE measured ( in millions of DM ) as the geometric mean of reporting class interval bounds for ﬁrst - stage survey responses ( with a minimum value of DM 30 , 000 for the ‘‘less than DM 100 , 000 group’’ 15 ) and as the mean point estimate for second - stage interview responses . The resulting regressions , with the number of citations as dependent variable and the economic value estimates ( along with seven IPC dummy variables ) as explanatory variables , are presented in table 2 . Several implications stand out . First , in every case the regression coefficients on ln VALUE ( interpretable as elas - ticities ) are signiﬁcantly positive , with t - ratios in the full - sample regressions of 2 . 72 and 3 . 09 . Second , the full - sample elasticities lie within a standard error of those obtained for the completely different U . S . sample of table 1 , despite the much smaller average number of German citations . Third , when the sample is limited to 66 patents with value estimates exceeding DM 5 million , higher elasticities with substan - tially larger standard errors emerge . 16 Fourth , the seven International Patent Classiﬁcation dummy variables together are statistically signiﬁcant in a chi - square test . As in the U . S . data , the instruments group had particularly high citations , as did ( unlike the U . S . results ) the class including textiles and paper goods . But ﬁnally , the pseudo - R 2 values are even more modest than in the U . S . regressions , revealing again that the value - citation relationship is quite noisy . 17 V . Conclusion In sum , our results from two surveys , one in Germany and one in the United States , reveal that patents reported to be relatively valuable by the companies holding them are more heavily cited in subsequent patents . Our evidence suggests at least a two - stage relationship between economic values and citation counts . First , patents that are renewed to full - term expiration in environments such as Germany with highly progressive annual maintenance fees are more highly cited than run - of - the - mill patents allowed to expire before running to full term . Other research reveals such full - term patents to be more valuable on average than patents allowed to lapse at midterm . Second , within the relatively select cohort of full - term patents , citation frequency rises noisily with reported economic value . REFERENCES Caballero , R . J . , andAdam B .

S . sample . When binomial regressions were conﬁned to 97 patents valued at $ 1 million or higher , the VALUE coefficient was 0 . 207 ( 0 . 059 ) without IPC dummy variables and 0 . 182 ( 0 . 063 ) with dummy variables . For regression 2b with 66 high - value patents , one could not conﬁdently reject the hypothesis that the citations were Poisson - distributed .
