Rizzoli * , Undine Lippert , Thorsten Lang , and Reinhard Jahn † Department of Neurobiology , Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry , 37077 Go¨ttingen , Germany Communicated by Thomas C . Su¨dhof , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX , December 23 , 2005 ( received for review December 4 , 2005 ) Membrane fusion in the secretory pathway is mediated by soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment receptor ( SNARE ) proteins . Different fusion steps are thought to be effected by independent sets of SNAREs , but it is unclear whether speciﬁcity is determined by an intrinsic speciﬁcity of SNARE pairing or by upstream factors . Using a newly developed microscopy - based assay , we have investigated the SNARE speciﬁcity of homotypic early endosomal fusion . We show that early endosomes contain multiple sets of SNAREs , including , in addition to the putative early endosomal SNAREs , those involved in exocytosis and in fusion of late endosomes . We demonstrate that fusion is largely mediated by a complex formed by syntaxin 13 , syntaxin 6 , vti1a , and VAMP4 , whereas the exocytic and late endosomal SNAREs play little or no role in the reaction . In contrast , proteoliposomes reconstituted with early endosomal SNAREs promiscuously fuse with liposomes containing exocytotic or late endosomal SNAREs . We conclude that the speciﬁcity of SNARE pairing does not sufﬁce to determine the speciﬁcity of organelle fusion . endocytosis (cid:1) exocytosis (cid:1) PC12 cells S oluble N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) - sensitive factor attachment receptor ( SNARE ) proteins are represented by a superfamily of small membrane - associated proteins that mediate membrane fusion in the secretory pathway . All SNAREs possess a SNARE motif that is usually flanked by a C - terminal transmembrane domain ( for recent reviews , see refs . 1 – 3 ) . SNAREs assemble into stable bundles of four (cid:1) - helices , forming coiled coils with the transmembrane domains located at one end of the bundle ( 4 – 6 ) . Each helix is contributed by a different SNARE motif belonging to separate subfamilies , termed Qa - , Qb - , Qc - , and R - SNARE motifs , respectively ( 7 , 8 ) . All functional SNARE complexes are thought to contain one member of each subfamily ( QabcR - rule ) , and , despite limited sequence homologies , the structure of SNARE complexes is highly conserved ( 6 ) . Assembly among SNAREs bridging the two fusing mem - branes is considered to be the key step in membrane fusion . It is probably initiated at the N terminus of the SNARE motifs and proceeds toward the C terminus ( referred to as ‘‘zippering’’ ) , resulting in a strained ‘‘trans’’ - complex . During membrane merger , the intermediate relaxes into a ‘‘cis’’ - complex in which the transmembrane domains are aligned so that they are parallel ( 1 – 3 ) . There are 25 SNAREs in yeast and (cid:1) 35 in mammals , and it was proposed that the SNAREs directly encode the specificity of organelle fusion ( 9 – 12 ) . According to this view , each SNARE complex functions in only one intracellular fusion step and pairs only with its ‘‘cognate’’ binding partners . For instance , the SNAREs involved in regulated exocytosis of neurons and neu - roendocrine cells , including syntaxin 1 ( Qa ) , soluble NSF at - tachment protein ( SNAP ) - 25 ( Qbc ) , and synaptobrevin (cid:2) VAMP2 ( R ) , are thought to function exclusively in regulated exocytosis . Similarly , unique SNARE complexes have been assigned for most trafficking steps in yeast . However , certain SNAREs function in multiple trafficking steps , and some SNAREs are known to substitute for each other ( 13 – 17 ) . Which are the factors determining , for a given SNARE , the fusion steps in which it operates and from which it is excluded ? In in vitro experiments involving soluble SNAREs , little discrimination was observed between SNAREs of the same subfamily in their capacity to form core complexes ( 18 , 19 ) . However , experiments involving fusion of SNARE - containing liposomes suggested a high degree of pairing specificity , raising the possibility that SNARE pairing is much more specific when the SNAREs are integrated in membranes ( 10 – 12 ) . In the present study , we have investigated the SNARE spec - ificity of homotypic fusion of early endosomes from neurose - cretory cells . Early ( or sorting ) endosomes are central relay stations for membrane recycling . Early endosomes are con - nected to late endosomes and lysosomes , to the Golgi apparatus , and to the plasma membrane , and they are involved in recycling of secretory and synaptic vesicles ( 20 , 21 ) . Consequently , the early endosomes would contain not only the SNAREs involved in homotypic fusion , but also SNAREs involved in fusion of the organelles with which they interact . Thus , homotypic fusion of early endosomes is suited as a model to investigate to which extent the SNAREs involved in this fusion step are differentiated from other SNAREs . Homotypic fusion of early endosomes is one of the best - characterized fusion reactions ( 22 ) . Recognition , tethering , and docking , the first steps in the reaction sequence , are orchestrated by the small GTPase Rab5 , which recruits a variety of effector molecules ( 23 – 25 ) . However , the identity of the SNARE pro - teins responsible for early endosome fusion has not yet been unambiguously determined . Proteins involved in Rab5 - effector complexes interact with syntaxin 13 ( Qa ) , syntaxin 16 ( Qa ) , and syntaxin 6 ( Qc ) . Furthermore , antibodies directed against syn - taxin 13 inhibit fusion ( 26 ) . Reports about a functional involve - ment of syntaxin 6 are contradictory , however ( 27 ) . Coimmu - noprecipitation studies revealed an association between syntaxin 6 , vti1a ( Qb ) , and VAMP4 ( R ) and syntaxin 16 instead of syntaxin 13 ( 28 ) . In another set of immunoprecipitation exper - iments , syntaxin 13 was found to be associated with synaptobre - vin 2 ( R ) and SNAP - 25 ( Qbc ) ( 29 ) . Moreover , botulinum neurotoxin E , which selectively cleaves SNAP - 25 , has recently been reported to block early endosome fusion ( 29 ) , whereas , in an earlier study , cleavage of cellubrevin and synaptobrevin by tetanus toxin had no effect ( 30 ) .

Postnuclear supernatants ( PNSs ) were combined and incubated for the times indicated , and the reaction was stopped by chilling on ice . Fused endosomes were enriched by Nycodenz density gradient centrif - ugation and then adsorbed on coverslips by low - speed centrif - ugation ( Fig . 6 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) , followed by image analysis ( Fig . 1 a ) . In vitro fusion of early endosomes is known to be ATP - dependent , and numerous bright spots labeled with both dyes were visible in the presence of ATP ( Fig . 1 b ) . The degree of colocalization ranged from 7 % to 27 % in 80 independent experiments , with much less variability in parallel experiments performed on the same day ( particles were scored as fused if their intensity centers in the two channels were not (cid:1) 100 nm apart , and all values were corrected for accidental colocaliza - tion ) . No colocalization was observable in the absence of ATP . Similar results were obtained with labeled transferrin , which is selectively internalized via clathrin - coated vesicles ( in three independent experiments , 6 – 16 % colocalization was observed in the presence of ATP , and no colocalization was observed in the absence of ATP ) . Fusion results in size increase of the organelles ( Fig . 1 c ) . The size increase exceeded what would be expected if each endosome would fuse only once , indicating multiple rounds of fusion . Fusion showed an almost linear increase within the first 10 min and plateaued after (cid:2) 1 h ( Fig . 2 a ) . Omission of rat brain cytosol reduced fusion , and no fusion was observed even after prolonged incubation on ice ( Fig . 2 b ) . Fusion was inhibited by the fast Ca 2 (cid:3) - chelator 1 , 2 - bis ( 2 - aminophenoxy ) ethane - N , N , N (cid:4) , N (cid:4) - tetraacetate ( Fig . 2 c ) . These findings are in close agreement with data obtained with a conventional content mixing assay ( 31 – 33 ) . Moreover , fusion was progressively inhibited by increasing con - centrations of NEM ( Fig . 2 d ) , which is attributed to the inhibi - tion of the NEM - sensitive factor ( 34 ) . To confirm this finding , we used a dominant negative variant of the cofactor (cid:1) - SNAP ( (cid:1) - SNAP L294A ) ( 35 ) . A dose - dependent inhibition of fusion was observed , whereas wild - type (cid:1) - SNAP was ineffective ( Fig . 2 e ) . Localization of SNAREs on Early Endosomes . To localize SNAREs , early endosomes were pulse - labeled and isolated as above , fixed , and immunolabeled for a variety of SNAREs ( Fig . 3 ) . Not surprisingly , there were many more immunoreactive organelles than labeled endosomes . To determine the degree of colocal - ization , linescans were performed after image alignment , fol - lowed by correlation analysis ( see Supporting Materials and Methods , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , for details ) . Correlation coefficients of 1 rep - resent complete colocalization , whereas correlation coefficients of 0 represent independent distribution . As a positive control , Fig . 1 .

Immunostain - ing for the early endosomal SNARE candidates , including syntaxin 13 , syntaxin 16 , vti1a , syntaxin 6 , and VAMP4 , resulted in a high degree of colocalization , similar to the transferrin receptor , a bona - fide resident of early endosomes ( 36 ) . Similarly high correlation coefficients were obtained for both exocytotic and late endosomal SNAREs and for the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin ( Fig . 3 c ) . In contrast , no correlation was observed for sec 22 and use 1 , two SNAREs operating in trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus , although immunopositive organelles were of comparable abun - dance ( Fig . 3 a and c ) . Inhibition of Early Endosome Fusion by Competition with Soluble SNAREs . To investigate which SNAREs are involved in early endosome fusion , we added recombinant soluble SNAREs to compete with assembly of the endogenous SNAREs and thus inhibit fusion ( 37 ) . Inactive cis - complexes formed between en - dogenous membrane - resident SNAREs and exogenously added SNAREs are probably disassembled by NEM - sensitive fusion , which counteracts inhibition ; thus , sufficiently high concentra - tions of the competing SNARE are required . Fig . 4 a shows the effects of the candidate early endosomal Q - SNAREs , including the two Qa - SNAREs syntaxin 13 and 16 , the Qb - SNARE vti1a , and the Qc - SNARE syntaxin 6 , either alone or in various combinations . Inhibition was observed in all cases . However , syntaxin 13 was consistently more potent than syntaxin 16 , and no additivity was observed . vti1a and syntaxin 6 caused partial inhibition , and a combination of vti1a , syntaxin 6 , and syntaxin 13 almost abolished fusion . No such synergism was observed with syntaxin 16 , suggesting that syntaxin 16 does not interact functionally with vti1a and syntaxin 6 . In contrast , the neuronal and late endosomal Q - SNAREs were largely ineffective in inhibiting fusion ( Fig . 4 b ) . As an independent means to exclude the SNAP - 25 functions in early endosome fusion ( 29 ) , we treated the PNSs with the light chain of botuli - num neurotoxin E , a SNAP - 25 - specific protease . No inhibition was observed ( Fig . 7 , which is published as supporting informa - tion on the PNAS web site ) . We also tested eight different R - SNAREs ( Fig . 4 c ) . VAMP4 inhibited fusion to a higher level than all of the other candidates ( (cid:1) 40 % inhibition , P (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) . Endobrevin resulted in only a minor effect ( (cid:2) 14 % inhibition , P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) , whereas synaptobre - vin , cellubrevin , Ti - VAMP , VAMP5 , Ykt6 , and Sec22 failed to elicit an inhibitory effect , despite some scatter in the results . Combining endobrevin and VAMP4 did not result in a higher block of fusion than that obtained with VAMP4 alone ( data not shown ) . Fusion of Proteoliposomes Containing SNAREs . The results described so far have established ( i ) that early endosomes contain at least three complete sets of SNAREs and ( ii ) that only one of these sets is mainly used for homotypic fusion . To test whether this specificity is encoded by the SNAREs themselves , we performed fusion experiments using liposomes coreconstituted with recom - binant SNARE proteins . Previous work has established that liposomes reconstituted with appropriate sets of SNAREs spon - taneously fuse with each other and that fusion is associated with the formation of SNARE core complexes ( 38 ) . Fusion was monitored by lipid dequenching ( 39 ) . First , we investigated whether liposomes containing all three early endo - somal Q - SNAREs ( syntaxin 13 , syntaxin 6 , and vti1a ) fuse exclusively with liposomes containing VAMP4 or whether they are also capable of fusing with liposomes containing synapto - brevin 2 and endobrevin . Robust fusion signals were observed in each case ( Fig . 5 a ) ; fusion was sensitive to competition by the corresponding soluble R - SNARE . Fusion activity was observed regardless of whether the Q - or R - SNARE liposomes were labeled ( Fig . 5 a and data not shown ) . Similarly , liposomes carrying neuronal Q - SNAREs fused equally well with liposomes containing either endobrevin or synaptobrevin ( data not shown ) . Second , we investigated to what extent fusion of Q - SNARE liposomes with VAMP4 - containing liposomes is competed for by soluble VAMP4 , synaptobrevin , and endobrevin . Again , all three R - SNAREs were capable of competing with fusion in a similar concentration range ( Fig . 5 b – d ) . Discussion In the present study we have identified the SNAREs syntaxin 13 , vti1a , syntaxin 6 , and VAMP4 as the main SNAREs responsible for homotypic fusion of early endosomes . Neither the SNAREs involved in exocytosis nor the SNAREs involved in the fusion of late endosomes participate to significant levels in the fusion reaction , although both sets of SNAREs are abundantly present Fig . 3 .

In contrast , proteoliposomes reconstituted with the same set of SNAREs promiscuously fuse with each other , showing that the specificity of organelle fusion is not determined by the specificity of SNARE pairing . Our assay for early endosome fusion is more sensitive than conventional content mixing assays , and it allows for performing immunocytochemistry on isolated organelles . However , the per - centage of fusion determined by particle counting is lower than that determined by classical contents - mixing assays . This diver - gence is to be expected because our assay does not discriminate between single and multiple fusion events , with the latter occurring abundantly , as demonstrated by the size increase during fusion . We were unable to identify a dilution - resistant state of the reaction , because dilution invariably caused an immediate inhibition of fusion ( D . B . and R . J . , unpublished observations ) . Moreover , attempts to define a docked but not fused state by measuring adjacent but nonoverlapping dots were not successful even when the putatively postdocking inhibitor 1 , 2 - bis ( 2 - aminophenoxy ) ethane - N , N , N (cid:4) , N (cid:4) - tetraacetate was used . Previous studies have shown that cell - free fusion assays are preferentially inhibited by cognate SNAREs although some crosstalk between cognate and noncognate SNAREs was ob - served . For instance , in cracked PC12 cells , exocytosis is more sensitive to inhibition by synaptobrevin (cid:2) VAMP2 than by VAMP7 and endobrevin (cid:2) VAMP8 ( 40 ) . However , specificity was not absolute because VAMP4 was almost as effective as synaptobrevin . Similarly , syntaxin 4 was almost as potent in inhibiting exocytosis as syntaxin 1 , whereas several other syn - taxins , including syntaxin 6 , syntaxin 8 , and syntaxin 13 , were Fig . 4 .

In our hands , a higher degree of specificity was observed . This observation closely agrees with the fact that the early endosomes form a main sorting platform through which many different SNAREs travel ; accurate sorting probably relies on effective mechanisms to select one set of SNAREs for the homotypic fusion while silencing all others . Our results show that the SNARE specificity of intracellular fusion reactions is not controlled by their ability to form complexes or by their ability to fuse liposomes , suggesting that pairing specificity is not a main determinant for the specificity of organelle fusion ( at least in early endosome fusion ) . Rather , it is likely that specificity is achieved by additional layers of control that may involve regions outside the SNARE motif or the outer surface of the helical SNARE motifs . Recently , it has been shown that the SM protein Sly1p increases the specificity of SNARE complex formation in the yeast endoplasmic reticulum - to - Golgi SNARE complex ( 41 ) , raising the possibility that SM proteins are an integral part of the SNARE proofreading mechanism . Another possibility is the direct interaction of specific SNAREs with organelle - specific tethering factors , as exemplified by the binding of syntaxin 13 and syntaxin 6 to EEA1 ( 27 , 42 ) . The contrast between the ability of recombinant SNARE motifs to inhibit endosome and liposome fusion asks for mechanisms that differentiate between individual SNARE mo - tifs of the same subclass , which remain to be identified . Materials and Methods Antibodies . The following antibodies were described previously : rabbit sera specific for syntaxin 7 and syntaxin 8 ( 37 ) , endobrevin ( 18 ) , and vti1b ( 43 ) , mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for synaptophysin Cl 7 . 2 ( 44 ) , synaptobrevin Cl 69 . 1 ( 45 ) , and SNAP - 25 Cl 71 . 1 ( 46 ) ( all available from Synaptic Systems , Go¨ttingen , Germany ) , and syntaxin 1 HPC - 1 ( 47 ) . Antibodies for the transferrin receptor were obtained from Zymed , and antibodies for (cid:2) - tubulin ( TUJ1 ) were obtained from Babco ( Richmond , CA ) . Secondary antibodies ( goat anti - rabbit and goat anti - mouse , Cy3 - labeled ) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch . Rabbit antisera were generated by using purified cytosolic parts of VAMP4 , syntaxin 6 , syntaxin 13 , and vti1a as antigens . All antisera recognized single bands of the expected molecular mass in immunoblots of PC12 cell homogenates ( data not shown ) . Where indicated , antibodies were affinity - purified by using the respective purified proteins bound to CNBr - Sepharose ( Amersham Pharma - cia ) .

VAMP5 , ykt6 , and sec22 were used as GST - tagged constructs , with GST alone used as a negative control . All proteins were 95 % pure as judged by SDS (cid:2) PAGE and Coomassie blue staining . Cell Culture and Internalization of Marker . PC12 cells [ clone 251 ( 50 ) ] were grown to confluence on 15 - cm - diameter culture dishes in DMEM ( with 5 % FCS , 10 % horse serum , 4 mM glutamine , and 100 units (cid:2) ml each of penicillin and streptomycin ) at 37°C in 10 % CO 2 . Cells were harvested by washing once with ice - cold PBS ( 150 mM NaCl (cid:2) 200 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) , adding trypsin (cid:2) EDTA ( 2 ml per plate ; Cambrex , East Rutherford , NJ ) . Fifteen confluent plates resulted in a cell pellet of (cid:2) 2 ml volume . Cells were washed with internalization medium ( OptiMEM ; Invitrogen , supplemented with 10 mM glucose ) , prewarmed , and incubated for 5 min with marker ( 10 - kDa dextran labeled with Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 , respectively ; Molecular Probes ) dissolved in in - ternalization medium . After the internalization had been stopped by diluting the cells in 10 ml of ice - cold PBS with 5 mg (cid:2) ml BSA , the cells were washed three times . Preparation of Subcellular Fractions and Rat Brain Cytosol . PC12 cells were homogenized as described in ref . 33 with slight modifica - tions . Briefly , the cell pellet was resuspended 1 : 4 in homogeni - zation buffer ( 250 mM sucrose (cid:2) 3 mM imidazole (cid:1) HCl , pH 4 . 7 ) with protease inhibitors ( 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 1 (cid:3) g (cid:2) ml leupeptin , 1 (cid:3) g (cid:2) ml aprotinin , and 0 . 7 (cid:3) g (cid:2) ml pepstatin ) and homogenized by 10 passages through a stainless - steel ball homogenizer with a clearance of 0 . 0008 inch ( 20 (cid:3) m ) . The homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 1 , 200 (cid:9) g , and the resulting PNSs were divided into aliquots and snap frozen in liquid N 2 . PNS fractions labeled with Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 were used for the cell - free fusion assay . Rat brain cytosol was prepared from fraction S2 ( 51 ) by centrifugation at 300 , 000 (cid:9) g for 30 min . Cell - Free Fusion Assay . Reaction mixtures ( 50 (cid:3) l final volume ) contained , as final concentrations , 4 mg (cid:2) ml PNSs , 2 mg (cid:2) ml cytosol , 11 . 25 mM Hepes at pH 7 . 0 , 1 . 35 mM magnesium acetate , 0 . 18 mM DTT , 45 mM potassium acetate , as an ATP - regenerating system , 3 . 2 mM ATP , 26 mM creatine phosphate , and 0 . 132 mg creatine kinase ( 800 units (cid:2) mg ; Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) or , as an ATP - depleting system , 5 (cid:3) l of hexokinase ( 1 , 500 units (cid:2) ml dissolved in 250 mM glucose ; Roche ) . The reaction mixtures were incubated in polycarbonate centrifuge tubes for 45 min at 37°C . After the reaction had been stopped by cooling on ice , reaction mixtures were overlaid with 100 (cid:3) l of ice - cold 30 % Nycodenz solution [ 30 % Nycodenz ( Nycomed Pharma , Unterschleissheim , Germany ) in 0 . 5 mM EDTA (cid:2) 3 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 4 ] and 100 (cid:3) l of ice - cold 12 % Nycodenz solution ( 12 % Nycodenz in 0 . 5 mM EDTA (cid:2) 3 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 4 ) and then centrifuged for 90 min at 170 , 000 (cid:9) g at 4°C . This purification step was necessary to reduce background fluorescence in the Alexa 488 channel . After removal of the top 130 (cid:3) l , 10 (cid:3) l was harvested from the top of the remaining solution and transferred into 1 ml of PBS on coverslips ( 18 - mm diameter ) in 12 - well plates . After centrifugation for 2 h at 1 , 500 (cid:9) g at 4°C , coverslips were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope ( see below ) . Before use of the coverslips , TetraSpeck beads ( 200 - nm diameter , dilution 1 : 100 , 000 in 1 ml PBS ; Molecular Probes ) were bound to the surface by centrifugation for 1 h at 1 , 500 (cid:9) g . For treatment with NEM , PNSs and cytosol were incubated separately with indicated final concentrations of NEM for 15 min Brandhorst et al .

For the experiments presented in Fig . 4 , PNS fractions were preincubated with recombinant proteins for 15 – 20 min . Coverslips were analyzed by using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope with a 1 . 4 numerical aperture (cid:9) 100 objective and appropriate filter sets . Several controls were performed to ensure that the centrifugation (cid:2) adsorption steps that followed the fusion reaction did not distort the results ( see Supporting Materials and Methods for details ) . Size Determination of Early Endosomes . Fusion assays with ATP - regenerating and - depleting systems were performed as de - scribed above . Images were analyzed by using the linescan function in METAMORPH ( Universal Imaging , West Chester , PA ) . Linescans with a width of 1 pixel and a length of 31 pixels were performed through the intensity centers of 311 fused and unfused endosomes , respectively . Values were corrected by the point spread function that was experimentally defined by mea - suring TetraSpeck beads of 200 - nm size in the red and green channel and divided into subclasses of 100 - nm size . Immunocytochemistry . PNSs obtained from labeled cells were in - cubated by using an ATP - depleting system as described above . Gradient centrifugation and adsorption to a glass coverslip were carried out as above except that the coverslips were preincubated with 10 mg (cid:2) ml BSA overnight at 37°C . Adsorbed organelles were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min , quenched for 15 min in PBS containing 50 mM NH 4 Cl , and washed two times with PBS . Primary antibodies were used in a 1 : 100 dilution in PBS containing 5 % FCS for 1 h . Subsequently , endosomes were washed three times with PBS for 10 min each , followed by incubation with secondaryantibodies ( Cy3 - labeled , dilution1 : 100inPBS (cid:2) 5 % FCS ) for 45 min . After washing three times with PBS , coverslips were imaged as described for the fusion assays . Other Methods . Liposome preparation and liposome fusion assays were performed as described in ref . 52 , except that the Hepes buffer contained 1 M KCl and further purification of liposomes on Nycodenz - gradients was omitted . Liposomes were adjusted to yield a final protein concentration of 3 (cid:3) M , and all fusion experiments were carried out at 37°C . SDS (cid:2) PAGE and immu - noblotting were performed as described in refs . 53 and 54 , and protein determination was performed according to ref . 55 . We thank Drs . P .

Supporting Materials and Methods Fluorescence Microscopy . Coverslips were analyzed by using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope with a 1 . 4 numerical aperture × 100 objective and a front - illuminated charge - coupled device camera with a 1317 × 1035 Kodak chip ( pixel size 6 . 8 × 6 . 8 µ m , Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) . Alexa 594 and Cy3 fluorescence was detected by using the excitation filter 565 / 30X - HQ , the beamsplitter 595 DCLP - Q , and the emission filter 645 / 45M - HQ . For detection of Alexa 488 fluorescence , the excitation filter 480 / 40X - HQ , the beamsplitter 505 DCLP - HQ , and the emission filter 527 / 30M - HQ were used . Fluorescence in the blue channel was detected by using the excitation filter 360 / 50X - D , the beamsplitter 400 DCLP , and the emission filter 460 / 50M - C . Exposure times were 4 s in the Alexa 488 , Cy 3 , and Alexa 594 channels and 0 . 2 s in the blue channel . Correlation Analysis of Double - Labeled Endosomes . For the correlation analysis of the images , linescans were performed by plotting lines with a length of 30 pixels and a width of 4 pixels through the intensity centers of endosomes in the red and green channels . The maximum pixel intensity values of each linescan were normalized to 100 % . The correlation coefficient of the two signals ( red and green ) was calculated by using the following equation with A i , intensity value red ; A ' , mean of A i ; B i , intensity value green ; B ' , mean of B i ; and i , number of values . Data Analysis . For each coverslip , six images from nonoverlapping fields of view with one TetraSpeck bead as reference were recorded in the Alexa 488 channel , the Alexa 594 channel , and the blue channel , respectively . Red and green images were filtered by using a 10 % high - pass filter with METAMORPH ( Universal Imaging , West Chester , PA ) . For each image , the threshold for the analysis was chosen in such a way that ≈ 100 objects with a minimum size of five pixels were above the threshold . These objects were 2 2 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( . ∑ ∑ ′ − ⋅ ′ − ′ − ⋅ ′ − = i i i i i i B B A A B B A A corr selected , and the x and y coordinates of their intensity centers were transferred to EXCEL ( Microsoft ) . Objects were sorted by their total intensity , and the shift between the channels was corrected with the TetraSpeck bead ( identified in the blue channel ) . Minimal distances between the intensity centers of objects in one image and objects in the paired image were measured . Objects were classified as fused if this distance was below 100 nm . A colocalization limit of 200 nm was used for the experiments in Fig . 4 c . Fusion rates were plotted as percentage of fused objects . These values were corrected by subtracting the random fusion rates ( the predicted fusion rates for random distribution of the same number of objects in the images ) . Fusion values of all six images from one coverslip were averaged . Images with 10 – 20 adsorbed TetraSpeck beads were used to check for the precision of the determination of the x and y coordinates . Ninety percent of the beads had a distance below 100 nm . Macros for the data analysis were programmed with VISUAL BASIC for EXCEL , including ( i ) the sorting of objects by total intensity and the correction of x / y shift between the red and green channels with the TetraSpeck beads as reference , ( ii ) the calculation of percentage of fused objects and the correction with the statistically expected value for the given density of objects ( see below ) , and ( iii ) the calculation of the mean of all values for fusion from different images of the same coverslip . Statistical Analysis of the Observed Distance Between Red and Green Particles . In our model , N g green particles and N r red particles are uniformly independently distributed on an area with size A . d g = N g / A describes the density of green particles . If we pick one red particle , the probability p that the distance to all the green particles is larger than r is given by : ) exp ( ) 1 1 ( ) ( 2 2 2 r d r d N A r A p g M g g N g g ⋅ − ≈ ⋅ − = ⋅ − = π π π So , for given r 0 < r 1 , the probability p , that the minimal distance to the green particles is between r 0 and r 1 , is p = exp ( – d g , j π r 02 ) – exp ( – d g , j π r 12 ) Let O be the observed number of red particles with the minimal distance to the green particles between r 0 and r 1 . Then ( ) ( ) p p N p N O V r r − ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ − = 1 2 2 is χ 2 - distributed with 1 degree of freedom . In case of V 2 ≥ 3 . 84 , the observed distances are significantly ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) different from the expected outcome . For positive O – N r ⋅ p we observe too many red particles with the specific minimal distance . If the term is negative , we observe too few . Next we analyzed J experiments , which are all of the same type and performed independently from the others . We can pool the results of the experiments to test our hypothesis that the distribution of the red and green particles is not random . For Exp . j , let O j be the observed number of red particles with the minimal distance to the green particles between r 0 and r 1 . p j = exp ( – d g , j π r 02 ) – exp ( – d g , j π r 12 ) is the probability that the minimal distance of one red particle to the green particle is between r 0 and r 1 . n j = N r , j = number of red particles in the experiment . Then is χ 2 - distributed with 1 degree of freedom .
