Pfeffer The GTPase dynamin has been clearly implicated in clathrin - mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membranes at the presynaptic nerve terminal . Here we describe a novel 52 - kDa protein in rat brain that binds the proline - rich C terminus of dynamin . Syndapin I ( synaptic , dynamin - associated protein I ) is highly enriched in brain where it exists in a high molecular weight complex . Syndapin I can be involved in multiple protein – protein interactions via a src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain at the C terminus and two predicted coiled - coil stretches . Coprecipitation studies and blot overlay analyses revealed that syndapin I binds the brain - speciﬁc proteins dynamin I , synaptojanin , and synapsin I via an SH3 domain - speciﬁc interaction . Coimmunoprecipitation of dynamin I with antibod - ies recognizing syndapin I and colocalization of syndapin I with dynamin I at vesicular structures in primary neurons indicate that syndapin I associates with dynamin I in vivo and may play a role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Furthermore , syndapin I associates with the neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein , an actin - depolymerizing protein that regulates cytoskeletal rearrangement . These characteristics of syndapin I suggest a mo - lecular link between cytoskeletal dynamics and synaptic vesicle recycling in the nerve terminal . INTRODUCTION Neurotransmitter release requires that synaptic vesi - cles fuse with the plasma membrane when intratermi - nal calcium rises , after which the synaptic vesicle membrane is rapidly recycled and reﬁlled with neu - rotransmitter . Recovery of plasma membrane after stimulated exocytosis is commonly referred to as com - pensatory endocytosis . Compensatory endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membrane proteins from the plasma membrane was originally attributed to only two cyto - plasmic proteins , clathrin and the heterotetrameric adaptor complex , adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) 1 ( for re - view , see Schmid , 1997 ) . A more complex model of endocytosis became necessary when the Drosophila shibire mutant that could not recycle synaptic vesicle membranes was shown to be defective in a GTPase , dynamin ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ; Koenig et al . , 1989 ; Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ) . Dynamin is now known to form tightly wound helical structures that participate in pinching off the constricted neck of a clathrin - coated pit ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Takei et al . , 1995 , 1998 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ) . It is likely that dynamin is normally part of a much larger mo - lecular machine that is responsible for compensatory endocytosis after exocytosis . Dynamin binds with high afﬁnity via a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) to four brain - speciﬁc proteins : amphiphysin I ( David et al . , 1996 ) , amphiphysin II ( Leprince et al . , 1997 ; Ramjaun et al . , 1997 ; Wigge et al . , 1997a ) , endophilin ( Micheva et * Corresponding author .

Am - phiphysin I , amphiphysin II , and endophilin bind to dynamin and other PRD - containing proteins such as synapsin I ( De Camilli et al . , 1983 ) and synaptojanin ( McPherson et al . , 1996 ) via their src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains . Interaction of dynamin via its PRD with SH3 do - main - containing proteins is essential to dynamin func - tion . SH3 domains stimulate the GTPase activity of dynamin I in vitro by binding its C - terminal PRD ( Gout et al . , 1993 ; Herskovits et al . , 1993 ) . Recruitment of dynamin to clathrin - coated pits is critically depen - dent on the amino acid sequence of a potential SH3 domain recognition site in its PRD ( Shpetner et al . , 1996 ) , suggesting the involvement of SH3 domain - containing proteins in dynamin targeting . PRD – SH3 domain interactions have been implicated in endocy - totic function . When injected into the presynaptic compartment of lamprey neurons , the SH3 domain of amphiphysin or a dynamin peptide containing the SH3 - binding site impaired synaptic vesicle recycling and caused the accumulation of invaginated clathrin - coated pits ( Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ) . A similar dy - namin peptide inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis in synaptosomes ( Marks and McMahon , 1998 ) . COS - 7 cells transfected with the amphiphysin SH3 domain were blocked in receptor - mediated endocytosis ; nor - mal endocytosis was rescued when dynamin was co - transfected ( Wigge et al . , 1997b ) . The PRD of Drosophila dynamin impaired the in vitro formation of synaptic vesicles in pheochromocytoma ( PC12 ) cells ( Shi et al . , 1998 ) . Furthermore , from immunoprecipitation stud - ies , PRD - and SH3 domain - containing proteins in the nerve terminal are known to interact with each other to form large , stable protein complexes ( David et al . , 1996 ; Micheva et al . , 1997 ; Wigge et al . , 1997a ) . An appealing conjecture , therefore , is that these molecules are linked together via their PRDs and their SH3 do - mains into protein machines that help form synaptic vesicles at endocytosis “hot spots” ( Estes et al . , 1996 ; Gonza´lez - Gaita´n and Ja¨ckle , 1997 ; Roos and Kelly , 1998 ) on the nerve terminal plasma membrane . To understand how a dynamin - based molecular machine might participate in synaptic vesicle recy - cling , the ﬁrst step is to identify the major components of the machine . While testing the binding speciﬁcity of the PRD of Drosophila dynamin , we noted strong bind - ing in rat brain extracts to amphiphysin I , amphiphy - sin II , endophilin , and a 52 - kDa protein ( Roos and Kelly , 1998 ) . Since the protein of 52 kDa had not yet been identiﬁed , we used the binding assay to purify it and obtained the sequence . We ﬁnd that the 52 - kDa protein is a dynamin - binding protein with an SH3 domain and sequence homology to a chicken focal adhesion protein 52 ( FAP52 ) ( Merila¨inen et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , the 52 - kDa protein interacts with an - other major nerve terminal enriched protein , neuronal Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . There is strong evidence that N - WASP plays a major role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton via its Cdc42 - binding domain and a verprolin / coﬁlin homol - ogy domain ( Miki et al . , 1996 ; Miki and Takenawa , 1998 ) . Thus the 52 - kDa , synapse - speciﬁc protein we have characterized might serve to link the dynamin - mediated processes of endocytosis to actin cytoskele - ton rearrangements within the terminal . We have called the 52 - kDa protein syndapin I be - cause it is the ﬁrst member of a family of synaptic , dynamin - associated proteins . MATERIALS AND METHODS Blot Overlay Blot overlays with recombinant fusion proteins were performed as described previously ( Roos and Kelly , 1998 ) . Brieﬂy , protein frac - tions were resolved on 4 – 15 % SDS - PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose . Membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat dry milk powder in PBS and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4°C with the GST fusion protein . Bound fusion protein was subsequently detected with afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies directed against GST or dynamin , goat anti - rabbit HRP - conjugated second - ary antibody ( Cappel / ICN , Aurora , OH ) , and the ECL detection system ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , United Kingdom ) . Puriﬁcation of Syndapin I Adult rat brains ( Pel - Freez Biologicals , Rogers , AR ) were homoge - nized in 1 : 3 ( wt / vol ) HEPES buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , and extracts were centrifuged at 235 , 000 3 g ( maximum ) for 75 min . Saturated ammonium sulfate solution was added to the supernatant to achieve 25 % saturation . The sample was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 17 , 000 3 g for 15 min . The resulting supernatant was then adjusted to 40 % saturation with ammonium sulfate , and the precipitation procedure was repeated . Lastly , saturated ammonium sulfate was added to bring the ﬁnal concentration to 60 % saturation . The resulting pellet was resus - pended and dialyzed overnight against HEPES buffer . The dialysate was then applied to a MonoQ anion exchange fast - performance liquid chromatography column ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) , and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient ( buffer 1 : HEPES buffer ; buffer 2 : HEPES buffer and 1 M NaCl ) . Syndapin I - positive fractions were detected by the overlay assay , pooled , and dialyzed overnight against 0 . 25 M bis - Tris , pH 7 . 1 . The dialysate was applied to a MonoP fast - performance liquid chromatography column ( Phar - macia ) . After running a linear polybuffer ( Pharmacia ) , pH 7 – 4 gra - dient , syndapin I was eluted with a linear gradient ( buffer 1 : HEPES buffer ; buffer 2 : HEPES buffer and 1 M NaCl ) . Syndapin I - positive fractions were pooled and resolved by SDS - PAGE . Syndapin I was excised , and protein microsequencing was performed by the Pro - tein / DNA Technology Center of the Rockefeller University ( New York , NY ) ( Fernandez et al . , 1994 . ) . Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Cloning of Syndapin I PCR cloning was performed with a forward primer ( 5 9 - CGCG - GATCCATGTCTGGCTCCTACGATG - 3 9 ) and a reverse primer ( 5 9 - CGGAATTCKATMGCCTCMACRTARTTKGC - 3 9 ) matching with the nucleotide sequence of the mouse h74 clone . Ten nanograms of cDNA prepared from a rat brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library in B . Qualmann et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 502 pGAD10 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) were used per reaction . The PCR product ( ; 1300 bp ) was digested with Bam HI and Eco RI and sub - cloned into the pGEX - 2T vector ( Pharmacia ) . The predicted amino acid sequence of the 1323 - bp product included the peptide se - quences obtained from the protein microsequencing project . Extension of the nucleotide sequence to the 5 9 - and 3 9 - ends was achieved by PCR using primers complementary to the syndapin I sequence ( at the 5 9 - end : 5 9 - CGTTGCACAAGCGGTGC - 3 9 ; at the 3 9 - end : 5 9 - CCGATGAGAGCGGAAACC - 3 9 ) and primers comple - mentary to the vector sequences ﬂanking the inserts , followed by a second round of PCR using nested primers complementary to the syndapin I sequence ( at the 5 9 - end : 5 9 - CGTCCGCTTGTAGTTCCC - 3 9 ; at the 3 9 - end : 5 9 - TCACCAAGCTCGGAGAGG - 3 9 ) and nested primers complementary to the vector sequences . PCR products from the second round were ligated into the pT - Adv vector ( Clon - tech ) . All PCRs were performed with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System ( Boehringer Mannheim , Indianapolis , IN ) . DNA of all PCR products was sequenced in the University of California , San Fran - cisco / Hormone Research Institute sequencing facility with an ABI model 373A sequencer . Recombinant Proteins Rat brain cDNA was used as a template to generate the following constructs for GST fusion proteins : full - length syndapin I ( SdpI ) ( amino acid residues 1 – 441 ) , SdpI - SH3 ( residues 376 – 441 ) , and the N - terminal part of syndapin I ( SdpI - N ; residues 1 – 382 ) . Full - length SdpI was generated with primer BQ023 ( 5 9 - CGCGGATCCATGTCT - GGCCCCTACGATG - 3 9 ) and primer BQ026 ( 5 9 - CGGAATTC - CTATATAGCCTCAACGTAG - 3 9 ) , SdpI - SH3 was generated with primer BQ041 ( 5 9 - CGCGGATCCAACCCCTTCGAGGACGATGC ) and primer BQ026 , and SdpI - N was generated with primer BQ023 and primer BQ027 ( 5 9 - CGGAATTCCTAGGCATCGTCCTCGAA - GGG - 3 9 ) . The PCR products were digested with Bam HI and Eco RI and cloned in frame into the Bam HI - Eco RI sites of pGEX - 2T . Constructs to express maltose - binding protein ( MBP ) fusion pro - teins of SdpI - SH3 and SdpI - N for afﬁnity puriﬁcation of anti - syn - dapin I antibodies were obtained as follows . PCR using the GST - SdpI plasmid as a template generated SdpI - SH3 and SdpI - N with an Eco RI site at the 5 9 - end and a Bam HI site at the 3 9 - end of the gene products . The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into the Eco RI - Bam HI sites of the pMAL - c2 vector ( New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA ) . MBP fusion proteins were expressed and puriﬁed over an amylose column following the recommendations of the manufac - turers ( New England Biolabs ) . Plasmids encoding for full - length SdpI and SdpI - SH3 harboring a point mutation in the SH3 domain ( SdpIm and SdpI - SH3m ) were obtained by PCR using wild - type syndapin I cDNA as a template with a primer partially matching the 3 9 - end ( 5 9 - CGGAATTC - CTATATAGCCTCAACGTAGTTGGCAAGATAGAG - 3 9 ) , which in - cluded a one - base exchange resulting in the substitution of leucine for proline at amino acid residue 434 . Full - length SdpIm was gen - erated with the forward primer BQ023 ; SdpI - SH3m was generated with the forward primer BQ041 . PCR products were cloned into the Bam HI - Eco RI sites of pGEX - 2T , and mutagenesis was veriﬁed by DNA sequencing . Generation of a plasmid encoding a GST fusion protein of the PRD of Drosophila dynamin ( GST - Ddyn [ PRD ] ) was described pre - viously ( Roos and Kelly , 1998 ) . An analogous construct encoding the rat dynamin I PRD ( amino acid 746 – 851 ) was obtained as follows . PCR was performed on rat brain cDNA using the forward primer 5 9 - CGGAATTCAACACGACCACCGTCAGCA - 3 9 and the reverse primer 5 9 - ACGCGTCGACTCAGGGGTCACTGATAGTG - 3 9 . The ; 300 - bp product was cloned into the Eco RI - Sal I sites of pGEX - 5X ( Pharmacia ) . GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells according to standard methods and were puriﬁed from cell lysates on glutathione - agarose ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) columns . Fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mM glutathione in 120 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , concentrated , and dialyzed against PBS . GST for control experiments was expressed from the plasmid pGEX - 2T . Antibodies Polyclonal antibodies against syndapin I were raised in rabbits by Alpha Diagnostic ( San Antonio , TX ) . GST - SdpI - SH3 fusion protein as an antigen generated antiserum 2521 ; GST - SdpI - N generated antiserum 2704 . Antibodies were afﬁnity puriﬁed ( Smith and Fisher , 1984 ) on MBP fusion proteins of SdpI - SH3 and SdpI - N . Fusion proteins were resolved on preparative gels by SDS - PAGE and trans - ferred to nitrocellulose . Pieces of nitrocellulose carrying the fusion protein were blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , washed with 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , and incubated with serum fo r 3 h atroom temperature . After washing the nitro - cellulose with 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS and 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , antibodies were sequentially eluted with 5 mM glycine , pH 2 . 3 , 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 5 % Tween 20 , and 0 . 01 % BSA . Eluates were neutralized immedi - ately wit h 1 M Na 2 HPO 4 . Rabbit antisera 2521 and 2704 also served as the source for afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - GST antibodies . Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against dynamin ( 2072 ) were raised and puriﬁed as described previously for anti - dynamin antibody 2073 ( Estes et al . , 1996 ) . Anti - dynamin monoclonal antibody hudy - 1 was the generous gift of Dr . Sandra Schmid ( Scripps Research Institute , La Jolla , CA ) , anti - synaptojanin and anti - endophilin anti - bodies were kindly provided by Dr . Peter McPherson ( McGill Uni - versity , Montreal , Quebec , Canada ) , and rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against N - WASP was kindly provided by Dr . H . Miki ( Uni - versity of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan ) . Monoclonal antibodies against synaptophysin , synapsin I , and synapsin IIa were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim , Stressgen Biotechnologies ( Victoria , British Columbia , Canada ) , and Transduction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY ) , respectively . Preparation of PC12 Cell Extracts and Rat Tissue Homogenates and Subcellular Fractionation PC12 cells were lysed with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in buffer A ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , supplemented with protease inhibitors ( 10 m g / ml aprotinin , 5 m g / ml leupeptin , 2 m g / ml antipain , 10 m g / ml benzamidine , 1 m g / ml chymostatin , 5 m g / ml pepstatin , 1 mM PMSF [ Sigma , Boeh - ringer Mannheim ] ) , for 30 min , and the lysates were then centri - fuged for 10 min at 16 , 000 3 g to obtain cellular extracts . Kidney , liver , lung , spleen , heart , and skeletal muscle were dis - sected from female rats , diced , and homogenized ( 1 : 3 , wt / vol ) in buffer A supplemented with protease inhibitors via 20 passes in a glass - Teﬂon Dounce homogenizer . Rat brains ( Pel - Freez Biologicals ) were treated the same way . To obtain postnuclear supernatants ( S1 ) , the homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 3 g for 20 min , yielding S1 and P1 . Postnuclear supernatants were further fractionated by differential centrifugation . The S1 fraction was spun for 30 min at 25 , 000 3 g , generating fractions P2 and S2 . The S2 fraction was centrifuged for an additional 60 min at 200 , 000 3 g , resulting in fractions P3 and S3 . All pellets were resuspended in buffer A 1 protease inhibitors . All procedures were performed on ice or at 4°C . Protein fractions were resolved by SDS - PAGE on 10 % continuous or 4 – 15 % gradient gels . Size exclusion chromatography of rat brain cytosol was per - formed at the analytical scale as follows . Five milligrams of rat brain S3 were charged on a Superose 6 column ( Pharmacia ) and eluted with buffer A ; 50 m l of the 0 . 5 ml fractions were resolved by SDS - PAGE on 6 – 15 % gradient gels and electroblotted to nitrocellu - lose membranes . After Ponceau - S ( Sigma ) staining , the protein pat - terns were analyzed by overlay analysis or antibody staining as described above . Syndapin Binds to Dynamin and N - WASP Vol . 10 , February 1999 503 Coprecipitation Assays ( Afﬁnity Chromatography ) Recombinant GST fusion proteins or the GST protein were immo - bilized on glutathione Sepharose 4B beads ( Pharmacia ) in PBS . Twenty - ﬁve microliters of saturated beads were incubated with rat brain cytosol ( 1 mg of protein in 250 m l of buffer A , prepared as described above ) overnight at 4°C with end - over - end rotation . Beads were washed extensively with buffer A and eluted with 20 mM glutathione in 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , and 120 mM NaCl for 30 min at room temperature . Proteins were then separated on 4 – 15 % SDS - PAGE and assayed by Coomassie staining , by Western blotting with various antibodies , and by blot overlay . Immunoprecipitation Dissected rat brains were homogenized 1 : 3 ( wt / vol ) in 10 mM HEPES , 1 mM EGTA , and 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 4 , supplemented with protease inhibitors ( see above ) via 20 passes in a glass - Teﬂon Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 130 , 000 3 g for 45 min . Triton X - 100 ( 1 % ﬁnal ) and NaCl ( 10 mM ﬁnal ) were added to the supernatant . Three micrograms of afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - syndapin antibodies or unrelated rabbit immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) were im - mobilized onto protein G Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) in the presence of 5 % BSA and , after several washes with immunoprecipitation ( IP ) buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) , were incubated with 1 mg of rat brain high - speed supernatant overnight at 4°C . Beads were washed four times with IP buffer and eluted with SDS sample buffer containing 4 M urea . Eluates were separated on 8 % SDS - PAGE and analyzed after immunoblotting by antibody staining . Primary Culture of Neurons Neuronal cultures were prepared from whole forebrains dissected from newborn rats . The cells were dissociated by trypsin treatment ( 0 . 25 % trypsin , 30 min , 37°C ) followed by trituration in a ﬁre - polished Pasteur pipette . Approximately 60 neurons per cm 2 were plated onto poly - l - lysine – and collagen - coated coverslips . Neurons were grown at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 in Neurobasal medium containing B27 serum - free supplement , 0 . 5 mM glutamine , and antibiotics ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) for 10 – 14 d . Immunoﬂuorescence Neuronal cultures were processed for double immunoﬂuorescence as follows . Cells were washed three times with PBS ( supplemented with 0 . 3 mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 3 mM MgCl 2 ) before ﬁxation in 4 % freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min . The remaining aldehyde groups were quenched by two washes in 25 mM glycine in PBS , followed by an additional PBS wash . Neurons were blocked and permeabilized fo r 1 h in 2 % BSA , 1 % ﬁsh skin gelatin , and 0 . 02 % saponin in PBS ( block solution ) . The coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies ( anti - syndapin I 2704 , anti - synaptophysin , and anti - dynamin hudy - 1 in block solution ) for 90 min . After three washes in block solution ( each 15 min ) , a mixture of the secondary antibodies , FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Jackson Immu - noResearch , West Grove , PA ) and Texas Red - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) , both 1 : 200 in block solution , was applied for 1 h . After several washes , neurons were mounted in 0 . 1 % p - phenylenediamine in 90 % glycerol . Incubations were viewed under a Leica TCS NT laser confocal microscope using the Leica TCS software package ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . RESULTS Isolation of a 52 - kDa Dynamin - binding Protein from Rat Brain Extracts A protein of ; 52 kDa was initially identiﬁed in a screen for dynamin ( PRD ) - interacting proteins present in rat brain cytosol ( Roos and Kelly , 1998 ) . We have now sequenced the protein and named it syndapin I . Syndapin I was one of four putative SH3 domain - containing proteins that were abundant in rat brain cytosol and identiﬁable in fusion protein overlay as - says ( Figure 1 ) . We have reported earlier that MonoQ anion exchange chromatography was able to separate amphiphysin I and II from syndapin I and endophilin ( Roos and Kelly , 1998 ) . Here , a signiﬁcant puriﬁcation of syndapin I was achieved by differential ammonium sulfate precipitation . Whereas endophilin precipitates at 25 – 40 % ammonium sulfate , syndapin I was precip - itated at 40 – 60 % ammonium sulfate . Syndapin I was subsequently puriﬁed by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography and then by MonoP chromatography as described in Materials and Methods . Primary Structure of Syndapin I Protein sequence was obtained for two peptide frag - ments of syndapin I . The amino acid sequences were compared with protein databases and were found to align exactly to two internal sequences of the pre - dicted gene product of the h74 clone ( GenBank acces - sion number 728604 ) , obtained from a mouse hip - pocampal cDNA library . Oligonucleotides for PCR ampliﬁcation of the syndapin I gene were designed according to the h74 sequence . PCR using a rat brain cDNA library as template yielded a 1323 - bp product whose deduced amino acid sequence includes a per - fect match of the peptide sequences generated from Figure 1 . Dynamin ( PRD ) overlays identify amphiphysin I , am - phiphysin II , syndapin I , and endophilin . Overlay analysis of rat brain cytosol fractions with GST - Ddyn ( PRD ) reveals a 52 - kDa pro - tein , in addition to bands comigrating with amphiphysin I , am - phiphysin II , and endophilin . Molecular weight markers on the left are in kilodaltons . B . Qualmann et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 504 the 52 - kDa band . Nucleotide sequences at the 5 9 - and 3 9 - ends of the gene were obtained by nested PCR . The primers for the nested PCR were synthesized to hy - bridize with the gene sequence and with vector se - quences ﬂanking the cDNA inserts . Figure 2A shows the obtained nucleotide and de - duced amino acid sequence of syndapin I ( GenBank accession number AF104402 ) . The coding sequence begins at a methionine codon at nucleotides 156 – 158 and is followed by an open reading frame extending to a TAG stop codon ( Figure 2A , * ) at positions 1479 – 1481 . The open reading frame encodes a putative pro - tein of 441 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 50 . 4 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4 . 93 . Within the coding region , no obvious signal sequences or putative transmembrane domains could be ob - served . A high degree of sequence identity was ob - served between the rat cDNA coding for syndapin I and the murine h74 gene ( 96 % ) . The N - terminal two - thirds of syndapin I are predicted to be a - helical and to include a region with the heptad periodicity char - acteristic of coiled - coil domains . The C - terminal end of syndapin I encodes an SH3 domain , encompassing residues 382 – 441 ( Figure 2B ) . The deduced amino acid sequence of syndapin I shares ; 65 % identity with the chicken protein FAP52 , an SH3 domain - containing protein localized to focal adhesions in cultured ﬁbroblasts ( Merila¨inen et al . , 1997 ) . Unlike syndapin I , which is highly enriched in brain tissue , FAP52 was present in all chicken tissues tested . Other SH3 domain - containing proteins such as Grb2 , paxillin , cortactin , yes , and the spectrin a - chain show . 80 % identity between mammalian and chicken forms , suggesting that syndapin I and FAP52 are in the same family of proteins but are not homologues . We have recently identiﬁed an additional brain - spe - ciﬁc isoform of syndapin I , which we call syndapin II , that is more homologous to FAP52 in sequence ( our unpublished results ) . Syndapin II has at least two alternatively spliced forms . In having an extended family , syndapin is reminiscent of another brain - spe - ciﬁc , SH3 domain - containing protein , endophilin , also called SH3P4 ( Sparks et al . , 1996 ; deHeuvel et al . , 1997 ) . SH3P4 or endophilin was detected in brain only , whereas mRNA encoding the related proteins SH3P8 and SH3P13 was found predominantly in testis ( SH3P13 ) or in all tissues examined ( SH3P8 ) ( Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) . This tissue distribution closely resembles the expression pattern of the three mammalian dy - namin isoforms ( for review , see Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . Syndapin I Is a Highly Brain - enriched Protein To characterize syndapin I further , polyclonal antisera were raised against recombinant GST fusion proteins of the SH3 domain ( residues 376 – 441 ) and the N - terminal part ( residues 1 – 382 ) of syndapin I . After afﬁnity puriﬁcation , antibodies from serum 2521 ( anti - SdpI - SH3 ) and serum 2704 ( anti - SdpI - N ) recognized a single band of 52 kDa in rat brain postnuclear super - natants ( Figure 3A ) . The electrophoretic mobility cor - responded to the band recognized by GST fusion pro - teins of the PRD of Drosophila ( Figure 1 ) and rat dynamin ( our unpublished results ) in blot overlays . In screens of postnuclear supernatants from various rat tissues , syndapin I immunoreactivity was only de - tected in brain . The protein was not expressed at a detectable level in liver , kidney , spleen , lung , heart , or skeletal muscle ( Figure 3A ) , not even after further enrichment by subcellular fractionation ( our unpub - lished results ) . At a low expression level , syndapin I was present in detergent extracts from undifferenti - ated PC12 cells . Thus , syndapin I appears to be a brain - enriched protein . Western blot and overlay analyses on subcellular fractions of rat brain homogenates demonstrated that syndapin I was present in both soluble ( S3 ) as well as sedimentable fractions ( mainly P3 ) , independent of the ionic strength of the extraction buffer ( Figure 3B ) . At physiological ionic strengths ( buffer A ) , the overall distribution of syndapin I during subcellular fraction - ation was similar to that of dynamin I and synaptoja - nin . Syndapin I Interacts via Its SH3 Domain with a Subset of Rat Brain Proteins Including Dynamin I , Synaptojanin , and N - WASP The blot overlay ( far Western ) technique was used to conﬁrm the interaction between syndapin I and dy - namin and to screen for the major syndapin I - binding partners in brain . Full - length syndapin I ( SdpI ) , the SH3 domain alone ( SdpI - SH3 ) , and the N - terminal part of the protein lacking the SH3 domain ( SdpI - N ) were expressed as GST fusion proteins . Rat brain sub - cellular fractions , resolved on SDS - PAGE and trans - ferred to nitrocellulose membranes , were overlaid with the puriﬁed GST fusion proteins . The full - length protein recognized eight major bands in rat brain cy - tosol with electrophoretic mobilities of ; 170 , 145 , 120 , 100 , 80 , 75 , 65 , and 55 kDa ( Figure 4 ) ; none of these were observed in liver , kidney , and heart cytosol ( our unpublished results ) . Dynamin in rat brain cytosol comigrated with the 100 - kDa protein , and synaptoja - nin comigrated with the 145 - kDa protein recognized by syndapin I . A protein doublet of 80 and 75 kDa , whose appearance in the soluble phase was salt de - pendent , was recognized by antibodies against synap - sin Ia and Ib and by the syndapin I overlay assay . A GST fusion protein containing the SH3 domain of syndapin I bound preferentially to the 100 - kDa band identiﬁed as dynamin and to a lesser extent to the other seven proteins .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 506 gion did not exhibit any binding to proteins in rat brain subcellular fractions . To address whether the observed interactions of syndapin I are critically dependent on the classical SH3 domain - binding interface , we mutated amino acid residue 434 from proline to leucine . Such a mu - tation in the SH3 domain of the Grb2 homologue sem - 5 caused a lethal phenotype in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Clark et al . , 1992 ) . The P434L point mutation com - pletely abolished the binding capacity of both full - length GST - SdpI and GST - SdpI - SH3 in overlays on fractionated rat brain homogenate ( Figure 4 ) . These results indicate that the interactions are speciﬁc and highly dependent on the SH3 domain consensus se - quence . To characterize the interactions between syndapin I and its binding partners further , GST fusion proteins comprising either the wild - type or the mutant syn - dapin I SH3 domain , immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose beads were incubated , with high - speed su - pernatant fractions of rat brains homogenized in buffer A . Bead - bound material was eluted with gluta - thione , separated by SDS - PAGE , and assayed by pro - tein staining , immunoblot , and blot overlay . As shown in Figure 5 , dynamin I and synaptojanin were specif - ically bound by the wild - type SH3 domain of syn - dapin I but not by the mutant form . Coomassie blue staining of bands of 145 - and 100 - kDa electrophoretic mobility ( Figure 5A ) further indicated that these two proteins were major binding partners of syndapin I in rat brain cytosol . In addition , overlay analysis of the bead - bound material revealed the synapsin I doublet and bands at 65 and 55 kDa ( Figure 5B ) . Antibodies against synapsin I demonstrated that the afﬁnity - puri - ﬁed bands of 80 and 75 kDa correspond to synapsin Ia and Ib . Western blot analysis identiﬁed the 65 - kDa protein that coprecipitated with the SH3 domain of syndapin I as N - WASP ( Miki et al . , 1996 ; Fukuoka et al . , 1997 ) , a highly brain - enriched multidomain protein sharing ; 50 % homology with the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein WASP ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) . N - WASP was iden - tiﬁed via its interaction with the SH3 domains of Grb2 , mediated via proline - rich stretches in the N - WASP sequence ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . Analysis of Syndapin I - containing Complexes in Rat Brain In high - speed supernatants of rat brains homogenized in medium ionic strength ( buffer A ) , syndapin I ex - isted as a high molecular weight complex that elutes from gel ﬁltration on a Superose 6 column with an apparent molecular mass of . 350 kDa ( Figure 6 ) . The elution proﬁle of syndapin I overlapped but did not exactly match with those of synaptojanin , dynamin , synapsin I , and N - WASP , the four PRD - containing proteins recognized by syndapin I in overlay analysis . Dynamin also comigrated with amphiphysin I but not with endophilin under these conditions ( Figure 6 ) . At low ionic strength ( 10 mM HEPES ) , the elution pro - ﬁles were shifted to even higher molecular weights ( our unpublished results ) . To investigate further the nature of syndapin I - con - taining complexes in the neuronal cytoplasm , we an - alyzed whether immunoprecipitation of syndapin I from rat brain high - speed supernatants resulted in the coprecipitation of dynamin I and N - WASP ( Figure 7 ) . Western blot analysis demonstrated that both dy - namin I ( Figure 7A ) and N - WASP ( Figure 7B ) were speciﬁcally coimmunoprecipitated with afﬁnity - puri - ﬁedanti - syndapin I antibodies . Thus , dynamin I and N - WASP are associated with syndapin I in rat brain . Colocalization of Syndapin I with Dynamin I and Synaptic Vesicle Markers in Cultured Neurons To determine whether the subcellular distribution of syndapin I was consistent with an in situ interaction with dynamin I and a possible role in synaptic vesicle recycling , double immunostaining in primary neuro - nal cultures was performed using antibodies against syndapin I , synaptophysin , and dynamin . Syndapin I immunoreactivity revealed an intense punctate stain - ing in the processes and surrounding the cell bodies of the neurons ; nuclei were immunonegative ( Figure 8 , A and D ) . Colocalization with synaptophysin at these sites indicates that syndapin I is present in presynaptic nerve terminals at a high level ( Figure 8 , A – C ) . Con - sistent with data from the subcellular fractionation , an additional diffuse cytoplasmic staining for syndapin I over the perikarya was observed . In another set of incubations , syndapin I and dynamin I immunoreac - tivities were compared by double - label immunoﬂuo - rescence using afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies against the N - terminal part of syndapin I and the monoclonal antibody hudy - 1 against dynamin I . Syndapin I im - munoreactivity overlapped with the dynamin I distri - bution ( Figure 8 , D – F ) . In addition to a diffuse cyto - plasmic ﬂuorescence ( different focus plain ) , dynamin I and syndapin I colocalized at vesicular structures in Figure 2 ( facing page ) .

DISCUSSION The protein we describe was identiﬁed by its ability to bind the PRD of both rat and Drosophila dynamin . It coimmunoprecipitates with dynamin and is enriched in synapses . We therefore propose to call it syndapin I for synaptic dynamin - associated protein I . Syndapin I exhibited an SH3 domain - mediated , di - rect binding to three major nerve terminal proteins implicated in the trafﬁcking of synaptic vesicles : syn - aptojanin , dynamin I , and synapsin I . SH3 domains appear to show preferences for different PRDs . In the experiments described here , the SH3 domain of syn - dapin I clearly preferred dynamin . The amphiphysin I SH3 domain has also been shown to prefer dynamin to synaptojanin ( David et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , pro - teins of the endophilin family recognized predomi - nantly synaptojanin in rat brain extracts ( Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) . The interactions between the major SH3 - containing proteins of the nerve terminal ( amphiphy - sin I and II , syndapin I , and endophilin [ SH3P4 ] ) and the PRD - containing proteins mentioned above are suf - ﬁciently strong to allow detection by the relatively stringent overlay assay . A high afﬁnity may let the proteins form a large protein complex that is either a protein machine that executes or regulates endocyto - Figure 3 . Tissue and subcellular distribution of syndapin I . ( A ) Proteins from postnuclear supernatants of various rat tissues or from detergent extracts of PC12 cells ( 100 m g per lane ) were re - solved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and processed for Western blots with afﬁnity - puriﬁed antibodies against SdpI - N . Protein expression was exclusively detected in brain and , at low levels , in PC12 cells after a long exposure ( exp . ) . ( B ) Proteins from subcellular fractions obtained by differential centrifugation of rat brains homogenized in buffer A were resolved by SDS - PAGE ( 20 m g per lane ) , transferred to nitrocellulose , and processed for Western blots with afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - SdpI - N – speciﬁc antibodies . Syn - dapin I was present both in soluble and sedimentable fractions ( predominantly S3 and P3 , corresponding to the 200 , 000 3 g super - natant and pellet , respectively ) . Figure 4 . Overlay analysis of rat brain cytosol with various GST - syndapin I constructs . Rat brain cytosol ( 20 m g per lane ) was sepa - rated on 4 – 15 % SDS - PAGE gels , transferred to nitrocellulose mem - branes , and either overlaid with 1 m M GST fusion proteins of syndapin I ( wild - type and P434L mutant of full - length syndapin I and SH3 domain only and SdpI - N , lacking the SH3 domain ) or incubated with antibodies against synapsin I , dynamin ( 2072 ) , and synaptojanin . Binding of GST fusion proteins was detected with afﬁnity - puriﬁed anti - GST antibodies . Full - length syndapin I fusion protein ( GST - SdpI ) reveals major bands at 170 kDa , 145 kDa ( comi - grating with synaptojanin ) , 120 kDa , 100 kDa ( comigrating with dynamin ) , 80 and 75 kDa ( doublet comigrating with synapsin Ia and Ib ) , 65 kDa , and 55 kDa , whereas the SH3 domain showed a high preference for the 100 - kDa band corresponding to dynamin ( GST - SdpI - SH3 ) . B . Qualmann et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 508 sis , a protein scaffold that holds the machinery close to the site at which it will be needed , or both . The exis - tence of large multiprotein complexes at sites of syn - aptic vesicle endocytosis is suggested by the presence of hot spots in Drosophila nerve terminals that are enriched in dynamin , AP2 , and the dynamin - scaffold - ing protein DAP160 ( Estes et al . , 1996 ; Gonza´lez - Gaita´n and Ja¨ckle , 1997 ; Roos and Kelly , 1998 ) . These hot spots are present both in resting terminals and after complete exocytosis of the vesicle content of a terminal . Formation of protein matrices requires more than two binding sites per protein , which is true for several members of the nerve terminal PRD - and SH3 domain - containing proteins . Amphiphysin I and II , dynamin , and endophilin have predicted coiled - coil domains that could mediate homo - or heterotypic in - teractions . Syndapin I has two predicted coiled - coil domains at amino acids 145 – 170 and 183 – 220 . It is also possible that one PRD can bind more than one SH3 domain - containing protein because endophilin and the amphiphysins did not compete for binding to the same PRD ( Micheva et al . , 1997 ) . A plausible hypoth - esis is that the rapid speed of the endocytosis process in nerve terminals results from several factors , includ - ing the 10 - to 50 - fold higher concentration of clathrin , dynamin , and AP complexes in neuronal compared with non - neuronal cells ( Morris and Schmid , 1995 ) , the association of these complexes into hot spots , and the neuron - speciﬁc isoforms or splice variants of pro - teins such as dynamin and adaptor proteins . Syndapin is similar to the recently described chicken protein FAP52 , a ubiquitously expressed SH3 domain - containing protein ( Merila¨inen et al . , 1997 ) . Whereas syndapin I colocalizes with dynamin I to presynaptic nerve terminals , FAP52 was localized to focal adhe - sions in cultured chicken ﬁbroblasts . The sequence homology between these two proteins suggests some relationship between the endocytotic machinery at the synapse and the machinery of cellular adhesion . Both focal adhesions and synapses are regions at which intracellular machinery is anchored to specialized re - gions of plasma membrane . We have also shown that syndapin I binds via its SH3 domain to the N - WASP protein . N - WASP , which shows ; 50 % homology to the Wiskott - Aldrich syn - drome protein WASP ( Derry et al . , 1994 ) , is found predominantly in brain nerve terminals ( Fukuoka et al . , 1997 ) and possesses several functional motifs . A pleckstrin homology domain near the N terminus that binds phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate is impor - tant in localizing N - WASP to the cortical cytoskeleton ( Miki et al . , 1996 ) . A GTPase - binding domain is recog - nized by Cdc42 , and the interaction between N - WASP and Cdc42 has been shown to regulate the formation of actin microspikes ( Miki et al . , 1998 ) . In addition to the PRD that is presumably binding syndapin I , N - Figure 5 . Identiﬁcation of major binding partners of syndapin I as dynamin , synaptojanin , synapsin I , and N - WASP . Soluble proteins ( S3 ) from rat brains after homoge - nization in buffer A were afﬁnity puriﬁed onto either wild - type or mutant GST - SdpI - SH3 immobi - lized on glutathione - Sepharose .

( B ) Precipitatedmaterial was analyzed by overlay with GST - SdpI and by Western blot analyses . Antibodies against dy - namin , synaptojanin , and synap - sin I demonstrate that the afﬁnity - puriﬁed bands of 100 , 145 , and 80 and 75 kDa correspond to dy - namin , synaptojanin , and synap - sin Ia and Ib , respectively . N - WASP – speciﬁc antibodies re - vealed that syndapin I coprecipi - tated N - WASP because of an SH3 domain - dependent interaction . Syndapin Binds to Dynamin and N - WASP Vol . 10 , February 1999 509 WASP has verpolin - homology and coﬁlin - homology domains that bind and sever actin ﬁlaments ( Miki et al . , 1996 ; Miki and Takenawa , 1998 ; Suzuki et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , syndapin I binds a nerve terminal protein , N - WASP , that associates with and regulates the dynamic of the actin cytoskeleton . Endocytosis has been linked to the actin cytoskele - ton by both genetic and pharmacological experiments . In yeast , several of the endocytosis mutations also affect the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( for review , see Riezman et al . , 1996 ) . Association between the actin cytoskeleton and the endocytotic machinery has also been observed in mammalian cells ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) . Both the actin - stabilizing drug jas - plakinolide and actin monomer - sequestering reagents such as latrunculin A and thymosin b 4 were shown to affect endocytotic processes ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Shurety et al . , 1998 ) . The link between endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton will be further strengthened if N - WASP is found to affect synaptic vesicle formation in the synapse . Strikingly , the dynamin - associated protein syndapin I is capable of interacting with three proteins implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization : N - WASP exhibiting actin - depolymerizing activity , the actin - bundling synaptic vesicle protein synapsin I ( Ba¨hler and Greengard , 1987 ; Petrucci et al . , 1988 ) , and synaptojanin , which is thought to regulate actin dy - namics via hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate bound to actin - regulatory proteins ( Sakisaka et al . , 1997 ) . Proteins associated with membrane trafﬁc or with the actin cytoskeleton often have PRDs or SH3 do - Figure 6 . Syndapin I exists in a high molecular weight complex .

Although such domains might mediate a direct interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and the endocytotic machinery , it is also possible that the do - mains allow two separate processes to be controlled by the same regulatory proteins . Establishing that di - rect linkage occurs in nerve terminals will need careful and complete analysis of the steps of synaptic vesicle formation . Note . While this manuscript was in review , the se - quence of a mouse homologue of syndapin I was reported and called PACSIN by Plomann et al . ( 1998 ) . In this study , PACSIN was discovered as a hippocam - pal protein whose mRNA level decreased dramati - cally after entorhinal - cortex lesion . Since we ﬁnd that syndapin I is a nerve terminal protein likely to be involved in synaptic vesicle recycling , we can infer that the lesions cause changes in synaptic number or function .
