Summary The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori colonizes half of the global population . Residing at the stomach epithelium , it contributes to the develop - ment of diseases such as gastritis , duodenal and gastric ulcers , and gastric cancer . A major factor is the secreted vacuolating toxin VacA , which forms anion - selective channels in the endosome mem - brane that cause the compartment to swell , but the composition and purpose of the resulting VacA - containing vacuoles ( VCVs ) are still unknown . VacA exerts inﬂuence on the host immune response in various ways , including inhibition of T - cell activation and proliferation and suppression of the host immune response . In this study , for the ﬁrst time the composition of VCVs from T cells was comprehensively analysed to investigate VCV function . VCVs were successfully isolated via immunomagnetic separation , and the puriﬁed vacuoles were analysed by mass spectrometry . We detected a set of 122 VCV - speciﬁc proteins impli - cated among others in immune response , cell death and cellular signalling processes , all of which VacA is known to inﬂuence . One of the individual proteins studied further was st romal i nteraction m olecule ( STIM1 ) , a calcium sensor residing in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) that is important in store - operated calcium entry . Live cell imaging microscopy data demonstrated colocalization of VacA with STIM1 in the ER and indicated that VacA may interfere with the move - ment of STIM1 towards the plasma membrane - localized c alcium r elease a ctivated c alcium channel protein ORAI1 in response to Ca 2 + store depletion . Furthermore , VacA inhibited the increase of cytosolic - free Ca 2 + in the Jurkat E6 - 1 T - cell line and human CD4 + T cells . The presence of VacA in the ER and its trafficking to the Golgi appa - ratus was conﬁrmed in HeLa cells , identifying these two cellular compartments as novel VacA target structures . Introduction Infection with Helicobacter pylori is responsible for chronic gastritis and gastroduodenal ulcers , but is also a high risk factor for the development of mucosa - associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) lymphoma as well as gastric adenocarci - noma ( Suerbaum and Michetti , 2002 ) . H . pylori strains may carry two major virulence factors : the active vacuolating toxin VacA ( Cover and Blaser , 1992 ) and a 40 kb patho - genicity island ( cag - PAI ) ( Covacci et al . , 1993 ) . The cag - PAI encodes a 120 – 145 kDa immunodominant protein termed cytotoxin - associated gene A ( CagA ) , as well as a type IV secretion system used by H . pylori to inject CagA into the host cell ( Odenbreit et al . , 2000 ) . The presence of a func - tional cag - PAI is associated with the development of severe gastric inﬂammation , the occurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer ( Suerbaum and Michetti , 2002 ) . VacA does not show signiﬁcant homology to any other known protein ( Cover et al . , 1994 ) . The mature toxin , which may be processed into N - terminal p33 and C - terminal p55 subunits , consists of three regions exhib - iting a particular allelic diversity : the N - terminal signal region ( with s1 and s2 alleles ) , the intermediate region in the p33 domain ( i1 , i2 , i3 ) and the mid - region in the p55 domain ( m1 , m2 ) ( Atherton et al . , 1995 ; Rhead et al . , Received 28 December , 2014 ; revised 27 May , 2015 ; accepted 11 June , 2015 . * For correspondence .

The s1 , i1 and m1 alleles are associated with more severe disease in humans ( summa - rized in González - Rivera et al . , 2012 ) . VacA binds to host cells , and during or after internalization , inserts into the membrane to form anion - selective channels ( Szabo et al . , 1999 ) that facilitate the inﬂux of Cl − ions . This causes the swelling of endosomes to so - called vacuoles . An interest - ing detail is VacA’s only strongly hydrophobic region , which is presumed to insert into membranes for channel formation ( McClain et al . , 2001 ) . A mutant version of VacA lacking this hydrophobic region ( VacA Δ 6 - 27 ) forms chan - nels considerably more slowly than the wild type , and fails to induce vacuoles ( Suerbaum and Michetti , 2002 ; Vinion - Dubiel et al . , 1999 ) . The membranes of these vacuoles carry markers of late endosomes and lysosomes such as Rab7 and Lamp1 and 2 ( Papini et al . , 1994 ; Li et al . , 2004 ) , and are therefore hypothesized to be a hybrid endolysosomal compartment , but VacA escapes lysosomal degradation ( Sommi et al . , 1998 ) . Other proteins that can be found on vacuoles include Rac1 and syntaxin - 7 ( Hotchin et al . , 2000 ; Suzuki et al . , 2003 ) . Rab7 and Rac1 are both small GTPases . Rab7 plays an important role in vesicle transport , particularly in the late endocytic pathway . Besides endosomal compartments , VacA is known to localize only to mitochondria , but how the toxin gets there is still a matter of debate ( Galmiche et al . , 2000 ; Willhite and Blanke , 2004 ; Domanska et al . , 2010 ) . The most prominent effect of the VacA – mitochondria interaction is the induction of apoptosis , which may lead to a faster turnover of cells , possibly providing more nutrients for the bacteria , whereas apoptosis of immune cells might help to suppress the immune response ( Rassow and Meinecke , 2012 ) . VacA - induced apoptosis may therefore be an important factor in persistence . Helicobacter pylori also inﬂuences the host T - cell response , partly through VacA . Intoxication leads to a down - regulation of IL - 2 production , which is important for T - cell viability and proliferation ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Gebert et al . , 2003 ; Sundrud et al . , 2004 ) . VacA inhibits the Ca 2 + calmodulin - dependent phosphatase calcineurin and , as a consequence of this , the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFAT , Nuclear factor of acti - vated T - cells , which controls IL - 2 expression . In the T - cell line Jurkat , altered expression of 46 genes was observed following VacA intoxication ( Gebert et al . , 2003 ) . The endosomal network is conventionally viewed as a sorting and trafficking system . It is responsible for the transport of a wide variety of cargo from the cell surface to sites of degradation or recycling . Moreover , a role of endosomes as signalling platforms is now recognized , assuming that signalling complexes are assembled on endocytic vesicles as a way of locally arranging all mol - ecules necessary to trigger a speciﬁc signalling cascade ( Sorkin and Von Zastrow , 2002 ; Miaczynska et al . , 2004 ; Gould and Lippincott - Schwartz , 2009 ) . The protein content of an endosome may therefore allow conclusions about the signalling pathway or network that the endosome is currently acting on . In the context of VacA intoxication , the presence of VacA on endocytic vesicles alters vesicular protein content ( Molinari et al . , 1997 ) , thereby possibly changing cellular signalling processes . The elucidation of the protein content of VacA - containing vacuoles ( VCVs ) could consequently provide information on signalling cascades inﬂuenced by VacA intoxication . The aim of this work was therefore to isolate VCVs from VacA - intoxicated cells and investigate their protein content by mass spectrometric ( MS ) analysis . The types of proteins found on VCVs could help not only to better understand the purpose of VacA - induced vacuolation but also to elucidate more of the cellular processes that VacA inﬂuences . These experiments were conducted in T cells , which are an important target of VacA . Results Strategy to purify intact VCVs from H . pylori VacA - intoxicated Jurkat E6 - 1 T cells The strategy chosen for VCV puriﬁcation was adapted from a protocol published by Hilbi and coworkers for the isolation of Legionella - containing vacuoles ( LCV ) from cells infected with Legionella pneumophila ( Urwyler et al . , 2010 ) . It relies on a primary antibody against bacterially produced VacA , which is present exclusively in VacA - fed cells , where it incorporates into compartmental mem - branes . A secondary antibody coupled to magnetic beads is then used in combination with magnetic columns to separate vacuoles from cell homogenate ( Fig . 1A ) . The antibodies are therefore an excellent tool to speciﬁcally affinity - purify VacA - induced vacuoles . With the objective to isolate VCVs from a cell lysate , a way to monitor VCV distribution in samples over the course of the isolation process became necessary . Rab7 is a late endosomal marker known to localize to VCV membranes ( Papini et al . , 1994 ) , and ﬂuorescently tagged Rab7 can conveni - ently serve as a VCV marker in ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Fig . 1A ) . A plasmid coding for an enhanced green ﬂuo - rescent protein ( EGFP ) - Rab7 fusion protein and a G418 resistance cassette was transfected into Jurkat E6 - 1 cells and transformants were obtained by G418 selection ( Fig . 1B ) . As the initial transfection efficiency was low ( approx . 10 % ) , EGFP - Rab7 expressing cells were enriched by ﬂow cytometry cell sorting , creating a cell line stably expressing the VCV marker EGFP - Rab7 as a suit - able tool for further VCV isolation ( Fig . S1 ) . An antiserum against a recombinantly expressed VacA fragment ( aa 92 – 723 ) had been established previously B . Kern et al . 1812 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 ( AK197 , α - VacA _ rec ) ( Schmitt and Haas , 1994 ) . Because α - VacA _ rec was not sufficiently capable of recognizing native VacA , a new antiserum was raised against native , puriﬁed toxin , here termed α - VacA _ nat , with the aim of using it in applications such as pull - down experiments or immunostaining . Therefore , native s1m1 VacA was iso - lated from H . pylori strain 60190 ( Fig . S2A ) and used for rabbit immunization ( see Experimental procedures ) . The antiserum obtained ( AK297 , α - VacA _ nat ) demonstrated its suitability for VacA detection under native conditions for s1m1 VacA ( H . pylori 60190 ) as well as for s1m2 VacA ( H . pylori P76 ) ( Fig . S2B and C ) . A functional assay ( neutral red assay , see Experimental procedures for details ) showed that binding of α - VacA _ nat to VacA prior to intoxication interferes with either VacA binding to cells or VacA channel formation ( Fig . S2D ) . To analyse α - VacA _ nat’s ability to recognize VacA after uptake into cells , it was used in immunostaining experi - ments . HeLa cells were intoxicated with acid - activated VacA - Alexa568 , ﬁxed , permeabilized and additionally stained with α - VacA _ nat and a secondary antibody coupled to Alexa488 ( Fig . S2E ) . Antibody and directly stained VacA can be seen to overlap for the most part , but the stain signal was usually stronger and not as regionally restricted . The fact that the antibody stain gave a more widely distributed signal is not due to unspeciﬁc staining , which was conﬁrmed by the relevant unintoxicated control sample ( data not shown ) . Instead , it is likely that not every VacA molecule was labelled with enough Alexa molecules to be detectable , whereas an antibody stain always entails an ampliﬁcation of signal . Importantly , it can be concluded that α - VacA _ nat does recognize VacA in this setting . General optimization steps for VCV isolation Because the VCV puriﬁcation process was to be moni - tored by microscopy , it was assumed that it would be easiest to isolate VCVs when they are large and numer - ous . To assess the quality of the starting material , Jurkat E6 - 1 EGFP - Rab7 cells were intoxicated with VacA - Alexa647 and treated with NH 4 Cl to enhance vacuole formation ( Morbiato et al . , 2001 ) and subjected to confo - cal microscopy before and after homogenization ( Fig . 1B ) . As expected , EGFP - Rab7 could be seen to line VCV membranes , whereas VacA - Alexa647 was found in the membrane and the VCV lumen . The homogenate contained numerous particles carrying both ﬂuorophores ( Fig . 1B , white arrowheads ) . Next , different periods of intoxication were evaluated for degree of vacuolation ( Fig . S3A ) . Vacuolation was observed to be time depend - ent , with the difference between 4 and 24 h being statis - tically signiﬁcant ( P < 0 . 05 , Kruskal – Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests ) . VCV sedimentation properties were systematically investigated in a sequential centrifu - gation experiment ( Fig . S3B ) .

After homogenization , intact VCVs were isolated by immuno - affinity separation using an antibody against native VacA located in the membrane of VCVs , followed by a secondary MACS microbead antibody and retention by a magnet . B . Jurkat E6 - 1 EGFP - Rab7 cells were intoxicated with VacA - Alexa647 and treated with NH 4 Cl ( both overnight ) before homogenization .

VacA - containing vacuoles and Ca 2 + signalling 1813 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 cells intoxicated with VacA and treated with NH 4 Cl were sequentially centrifuged ( 200 – 20 000 × g ) . The pellets of all steps were then analysed by Western blot for the presence of VacA and EGFP . Cell suspension and homogenate served as controls for total VacA / EGFP - Rab7 content . Not all VacA / EGFP - Rab7 sedimented together with VCVs , but both were detected in some of the fractions . VacA , which is expected to occur not just in VCVs but also in other cellular compartments and bound to plasma membrane , could be found in all fractions up to 6000 × g . Based on previous microscopy observations , most of EGFP - Rab7 was expected to be localized in VCVs . It was detected most prominently in the 3000 × g fraction . Because this fraction was also positive for VacA , it was therefore concluded to contain the majority of VCVs . Some of the conditions detailed for the isolation of LCVs were used as initial starting points for this work , including the homogenization buffer , HS * [ 20 mM N - [ 2 - hydroxyethyl ] piperazine - N ′ - [ 2 - ethanesulfonic acid ] ( HEPES ) , 250 mM sucrose , 0 . 5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) , pH 7 . 2 , with added protease inhibitors ] ( Urwyler et al . , 2010 ) . However , this turned out to not be ideal for the purpose of isolating VCVs , as it did not preserve vacuole shape in homogenate ( Fig . S3C ) , making it difficult to identify VCVs in the later steps of the isolation process . Phosphate - buffered saline * ( PBS * ) ( also supplemented with protease inhibitors ) was found to fulﬁl this requirement . HS * buffer seems to have an inadequate osmotic pressure , leading to a collapse of VCVs , which is in agreement with the fact that it was developed for vacu - oles containing whole bacteria unlike VCVs . Fixation of VCVs presented similar problems , as vacuole shape was not retained in either intact cells or homogenate . Vacuole shape was , however , a necessary identifying feature of VCVs alongside EGFP ﬂuorescence . Various ﬁxation reagents were tested at different concen - trations and conditions [ glutaraldehyde , cyclohexylamine , methanol , ethanol , paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) with and without sucrose , PFA in HEPES and CellFIX ( BD Biosciences ) ] , but none proved successful , as demon - strated for cells ﬁxed with 0 . 5 % PFAand homogenate ﬁxed with 3 % PFA for 10 min at RT ( Fig . S3D ) as an example . During ﬁxation , VCVs lost their characteristic round shape and shrank in size , making non - ambiguous identiﬁcation impossible . All monitoring of VCV isolation was henceforth performed with unﬁxed samples in 8 - well slides . VCV isolation procedure The VCV isolation process was monitored by confocal microscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) / Coomassie staining of cells before homogenization ( ‘intact cells’ ) , homogenate after clearance ( ‘homogenate’ ) , material that had not bound to the magnetic column ( ‘ﬂowthrough’ ) and eluate ( Fig . 2A and B ) . Fluorescent , round particles resembling vacuoles were found in all fractions when cells were treated with wild - type VacA , but not when cells were treated with VacA Δ 6 - 27 ( Fig . 2A ) or untreated cells ( data not shown ) . This was to be expected as VacA Δ 6 - 27 is still able to bind to cells , but does not readily form mem - brane channels and therefore has no vacuolating activity ( Vinion - Dubiel et al . , 1999 ) . Some non - ﬂuorescent mate - rial is puriﬁed for both variants of VacA ( data not shown ) , which is assumed to be mostly plasma membrane with VacA bound to it . This also explains the proteins visible in eluate of VacA Δ 6 - 27 - treated sample when applied to SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 2B and C ) . Cells treated with VacA Δ 6 - 27 ( B1 ) or cells without VacA treatment ( B2 ) served as a valuable background controls for MS analy - sis , as non - speciﬁc , non - VCV material is puriﬁed and can then be distinguished from VCV - speciﬁc proteins in the wild - type sample . For these reasons , wild - type and VacA Δ 6 - 27 - eluted VCV fractions can be seen to have a largely congruent protein composition in a direct com - parison ( Fig . 2C ) . However , both eluates’ composition differs enough from that of intact cells to indicate enrich - ment of VacA - bound material or VCVs . Analysis of the protein content of VCVs by MS MS experiments were conducted for four VCV prepara - tions : two obtained from cells treated with wild - type VacA ( WT1 / 2 ) , one from cells treated with VacA Δ 6 - 27 ( background BG1 ) and one from cells with no VacA treatment ( background BG2 ) , both of which were com - bined to the total background ( BG ) . Analysis of MS samples yielded lists of proteins . The accession numbers associated with these proteins were entered into the UniProt database and their information retrieved , but only reviewed entries were considered to ensure high reliability of information ( http : / / www . uniprot . org ) . Two subsets were analysed in detail and compared . The BG sample ( 2019 proteins ) represented proteins puriﬁed in the presence of mutant VacA Δ 6 - 27 and without VacA , but in the absence of VCVs . The VCV - speciﬁc subset of proteins was detected in both wild - type samples , but not in any of the background sample ( 122 proteins ) ( Fig . 3A ) . Full lists of proteins can be found in the supplementary tables ( see Table S3 for VCV - speciﬁc proteins , Table S4 for WT1 proteins , Table S5 for WT2 proteins , Table S6 for BG1 and Table S7 for BG2 proteins ) . Using the information provided by UniProt , the proteins included in these two subsets were investigated more closely regarding their subcellular location and biological function . A graphic representation showing the VCV - B . Kern et al . 1814 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 speciﬁc subset is shown in Fig . S4 , whereas the same information is provided in a table format ( Fig . 3B ) . To demonstrate the enrichment procedure during VCV puri - ﬁcation steps and to verify the data obtained by MS , we performed Western blotting of exempliﬁed mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) protein candidates ( see Fig . S5A for a list of proteins tested ) . The mitochondrial Aconitase ( ACO2 ) , a typical mitochondrial protein of the tricarboxylic acid cycle , and the ribosome - associated GTPase 1 ( MTG1 ) could be demonstrated in the unhomogenized fraction by the speciﬁc antibodies . Aconitase was found in the homogenized fraction and was enriched in the ﬂowthrough and eluate , but MTG1 was lost during the puriﬁcation steps , probably by removal of the mitochondria during the VCV - sedimenting low speed centrifugation step ( 3000 × g , 30 min , see Experi - mental procedures ) ( Fig . S5B ) . As typical ER proteins , we chose calnexin ( CANX ) ( identiﬁed in VCVs by MS ) and ER to nucleus signalling 2 ( ERN2 ) ( not identiﬁed in VCVs by MS ) for Western blotting . Calcineurin was detected in all fractions of the puriﬁcation procedure and strongly enriched in the eluate , whereas ERN2 , which is present in very low amounts in the unhomogenized fraction , was not detected in any of the puriﬁed fractions ( Fig . S5C ) . Thus , the immunoblotting data supported the speciﬁc enrich - ment of certain mitochondrial or ER - located proteins in VCVs , whereas other proteins of these organelles were absent , indicating that speciﬁc proteins from mitochondria or ER were incorporated into VCVs , rather than the whole mitochondria or ER . Colocalization of VacA with ER , Golgi apparatus markers and CTxB In order to connect the results we obtained from biochemi - cal characterization of isolated VCVs with uptake and trafficking of VacA within living cells , we chose to study the colocalization of VacA with cellular compartments . Late trafficking of VacA inside intoxicated cells is not very well researched . VacA is taken up into endocytic compart - ments that were shown to be GIP - AP - enriched early endosomal compartments ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) , and is then routed through early and late endosomes , ﬁnally reaching compartments carrying both endosomal and V a c A Δ 6 - 27 Intact cells Homogenate Flowthrough Eluate V a c A A B VacA Δ 6 - 27 kDa 170 100 55 25 VacA kDa 170 100 55 25 C Fig . 2 .

A . Equal portions of each step were loaded into an 8 - well slide and checked for vacuolation and number of VCVs by confocal microscopy ( Leica SP5 ) .

VacA - containing vacuoles and Ca 2 + signalling 1815 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 lysosomal markers ( Molinari et al . , 1997 ; Li et al . , 2004 ) , but avoiding degradation ( Sommi et al . , 1998 ) . After 4 h , VacA is found in vesicles scattered throughout the cytosol ( Fig . 4A , ﬁrst column ) , which become enlarged VCVs in the presence of weak bases ( Morbiato et al . , 2001 ) . VacA is also known to localize to mitochondria , more speciﬁ - cally to the inner mitochondrial membrane ( Galmiche et al . , 2000 ; Willhite and Blanke , 2004 ; Domanska et al . , 2010 ) , and it may be transported there via VCVs ( Calore et al . , 2010 ) . However , a localization of VacA to other intracellular compartments has not yet been reported . Therefore , HeLa cells were intoxicated with VacA - Alexa488 , ﬁxed , permeabilized and stained for the ER marker CANX , or the Golgi apparatus marker giantin . In a similar set - up , cells were intoxicated simultaneously with Alexa - labelled cholera toxin subunit B ( CTxB - Alexa555 ) . Although its uptake differs from that of VacA ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) , CTxB is transported via the retrograde endocytic pathway to the Golgi ( Progida et al . , 2010 ) , and might therefore provide an interesting comparison . DAPI staining of cell nuclei served as a general indicator of cell health . VacA and the marker proteins exhibit partial colocalization , suggesting that at least part of the internal - ized VacA localizes to the ER and the Golgi apparatus respectively ( Fig . 4A ) . Colocalization of VacA and CTxB not only in the large area representing the Golgi implies similarities in the transport of both toxins , but this may only be the case for CTxB that has not yet reached its ﬁnal destination . Interestingly , a substantial amount of VacA was also found to localize in compartments closely asso - ciated with the Golgi apparatus ( Fig . 4B ) . These compart - ments may represent VacA being transported to or from the Golgi , possibly on its way to the ER via retrograde trafficking . H . pylori VacA colocalizes with STIM1 in the ER VacA has been reported to inﬂuence intracellular calcium signalling and to severely disrupt T - cell activation and proliferation ( Chan et al . , 1996 ; Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Gebert et al . , 2003 ; De Bernard et al . , 2005 ) . A possible intermediate in these processes is the Ca 2 + calmodulin - dependent phosphatase calcineurin in T cells ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Gebert et al . , 2003 ) , which needs sustained high intracellular calcium levels in order to function properly ( Fracchia et al . , 2013 ) .

Kern et al . 1816 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 tor type 3 ( ITPR3 ) ( Table 1 ) . Both usually locate to the ER and are essential in T - cell calcium signalling ( reviewed in Soboloff et al . , 2012 ; Fracchia et al . , 2013 ) . STIM1 can relocate to the plasma membrane to bind the Ca 2 + release - activated Ca 2 + ( CRAC ) channel protein ORAI1 ( coupling ) for initiating extracellular Ca 2 + inﬂux . Thus , the discovery of STIM1 and ITPR3 on VCVs proposes a role of VacA in calcium signalling . To verify a potential locali - zation of VacA in the ER and a possible functional role of VacA concerning the regulation of cytoplasmic calcium levels , we applied confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) studies . Puriﬁed wild - type VacA was labelled with Alexa Fluor647 dye as described ( see Experimental procedures for details ) . Having conﬁrmed the activity of labelled VacA - Alexa647 , human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) - 293 cells expressing mCherry - STIM1 were incubated with acid activated VacA - Alexa647 for 4 h and used for live cell imaging microscopy ( PerkinElmer spinning disc micro - scope ) . VacA - Alexa647 clearly colocalized with mCherry - STIM1 , as demonstrated after clustering in response to thapsigargin treatment , an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic / ER calcium ATPase , which causes deple - tion of the ER calcium store ( Fig . 5A – E ) . We noticed that VacA slightly colocalizes already with STIM1 before thapsigargin treatment ( data not shown ) , and we cannot exclude that this is due to the overexpression upon transfection . However , the colocalization image reveals that VacA localizes towards STIM1 , but not towards ORAI1 ( Fig . 5A – F ) . Thus , our microscopic data support and corroborate the ﬁrst preliminary VCV proteome data and suggest that in addition to its localization in mitochon - dria , VacA can also locate to the ER to colocalize with the Ca 2 + sensor STIM1 .

We therefore analysed the effect of thapsigargin on STIM1 oligomerization and clus - tering in the presence of VacA . HEK - 293 cells were transfected with a mCherry - STIM1 - encoding plasmid car - rying the G418 resistance cassette . The mCherry expres - sion of STIM1 was analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) ( Fig . 6A – C ) . The cells were visualized ﬁrst without thapsigargin treatment , and then thapsigargin was added ( 1 μ M ) to mCherry - STIM1 expressing HEK - 293 cells . A strong STIM1 clustering occurred over time upon thapsigargin treatment from 360 to 1500 s ( Fig . 6A ) . In the next step , we thought to test whether the binding of VacA to STIM1 had an effect on STIM1 / ORAI1 coupling and consequently in store - operated calcium entry ( SOCE ) . Stably expressing EGFP - myc - ORAI1 HEK - 293 cells ( Park et al . , 2009 ) were transfected with a plasmid for the expression of mCherry - STIM1 and then incubated with VacA - Alexa647 . A signiﬁcant degree of colocalization occurred between mCherry - STIM1 and EGFP - myc - ORAI1 in HEK - 293 cells containing relatively little VacA - Alexa647 after 120 s of thapsigargin treatment ( Fig . 6B ) . However , little colocalization between mCherry - STIM1 and EGFP - myc - ORAI1 was seen in the cells with signiﬁ - cantly more internalized VacA - Alexa647 ( Fig 6C ) . In conclusion , the microscopic data suggested that the trafficking of VacA to the ER and colocalization of VacA with STIM1 might interfere with the movement of STIM1 to the plasma membrane channel ORAI1 , which could have Table 1 .

VacA - containing vacuoles and Ca 2 + signalling 1819 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 consequences for the CRAC channel to open for Ca 2 + inﬂux . H . pylori VacA inhibits the increase of cytosolic - free Ca 2 + in human Jurkat E6 - 1 T - cell line and human CD4 + T cells In order to measure an effect of VacA on Ca 2 + inﬂux , we used the human Jurkat E6 - 1 T - cell line as well as primary human CD4 + T cells ( Fig . 7 ) . To measure the intracellular level of calcium , the Fluo - 4 NW calcium assay was used . Fluo - 4 NW is a ﬂuorescent Ca 2 + indicator with high sen - sitivity and high ﬂuorescence . Its ﬂuorescence is increased upon binding of Ca 2 + in the cytoplasm of the cells . Once inside the cells , Fluo - 4 AM is hydrolysed by intracellular esterases resulting in the negatively charged membrane impermeable form , which is capable of binding Ca 2 + and emits ﬂuorescence . To sequester extracellular Ca 2 + , a combination of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) - EGTA was used . Intracellular Ca 2 + sequestering was achieved by treatment with BAPTA AM . Additionally , EDTA - EGTA and BAPTAAM were both used to sequester all free Ca 2 + ( baseline control ) . After 4 h of incubation , the cells were evaluated by ﬂuorescence measurement in a ﬂuorescence microplate reader ( FLUOstar OPTIMA ) . Thapsigargin - induced store depletion consequently acti - vated plasma membrane calcium channels , allowing an inﬂux of calcium into the cytosol ( Fig . 7A , black line ; B , black graph ) . To evaluate the effect of VacA on Jurkat E6 - 1 cells stimulated by thapsigargin , the cells were pre - incubated with puriﬁed acid activated wild - type VacA or VacA Δ 6 - 27 for 3 h and then were loaded with Fluo - 4 NW calcium assay dye for further 1 h and then evaluated by ﬂuorescence measurement ( see Experimental proce - dures ) . A dose - dependent reduction of the increase of cytosolic - free Ca 2 + was observed in Jurkat E6 - 1 T cells , when the cells were pre - incubated with VacA , as com - pared with untreated thapsigargin - stimulated cells ( Fig . 7A and B ) ( P < 0 . 01 ) . The effect of VacA to inhibit the increase of cytosolic - free Ca 2 + was consistent over time ( as measured 35 min up to 60 min after thapsigargin stimulation ) ( Fig . 7A and B ) . For VacA Δ 6 - 27 , no signiﬁcant inhibition in Ca 2 + inﬂux was observed as compared with the VacA untreated control ( Fig . 7B ) . When puriﬁed human CD4 + T cells were stimulated with thapsigargin and treated with VacA , a signiﬁcant reduction of intracel - lular Ca 2 + was observed ( P < 0 . 01 ) , but no signiﬁcant reduction was found by VacA Δ 6 - 27 treatment ( 58 min ) mCherry - STIM1 A EGFP - ORAI1 VacA - Alexa647 + Tg t = 60 min Merge STIM1 / VacA Colocaliza(cid:2)on ORAI1 / VacA No colocaliza(cid:2)on C B E F D Fig . 5 .

Kern et al . 1820 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 ( Fig . 7C and D ) . In order to completely inhibit the Ca 2 + inﬂux into the cells , a mixture of EDTA - EGTA and BAPTA AM was added and the control measurements were taken to obtain the baseline control ( Fig . 7A – D ) . Taken together , the Ca 2 + measurements in Jurkat E6 - 1 and primary CD4 + T cells clearly show that VacA is able to block Ca 2 + inﬂux upon thapsigargin - mediated ER store depletion , suggesting that the STIM1 / ORAI1 system is a target for VacA interference . Discussion The namesake cellular effect of intoxication with H . pylori vacuolating toxin VacA is the formation of large cytoplas - mic vacuoles ( Leunk et al . , 1988 ; Cover et al . , 1994 ) . Until now , the function of these vacuoles is not known . They arise from endocytic vesicles containing VacA channels in their limiting membrane , which allow the inﬂux of chloride ions , causing acidiﬁcation and subsequent osmotic swell - ing of the vesicles ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ) . VacA also exerts a variety of other effects on intoxicated cells , including the induction of apoptosis , the inhibition of T - cell activation and proliferation , and interference with intracel - lular calcium signalling , all of which depend on VacA channel - forming activity ( Boquet and Ricci , 2012 ) . In this study , VCVs were isolated and their protein content was analysed by MS . This revealed information about the vacuoles’ speciﬁc protein content and may help under - stand their purpose . Another part of this study further explored VacA involvement in calcium signalling . Moreo - ver , additional possible cellular target structures of VacA , besides vacuoles and mitochondria , were investigated . VCVs were successfully puriﬁed immunomagnetically , adapting a strategy originally published for the isolation of LCVs ( Urwyler et al . , 2010 ) . To this end , two indispensable tools were established . The ﬁrst is a polyclonal antiserum , Tg + Tg EGFP - ORAI1 Co - localisa(cid:2)on ORAI1 / STIM1 Co - localisa(cid:2)on ORAI1 / STIM1 EGFP - ORAI1 Fig . 6 . mCherry - STIM1 oligomerization upon thapsigargin treatment in HEK - 293 cells and colocalization of STIM1 and ORAI1 with high or low VacA levels .

VacA - containing vacuoles and Ca 2 + signalling 1821 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 which was shown to recognize VacA in its native confor - mation by native immunoblotting , functional inhibition of VacA - induced vacuolation and immunostaining ( Fig . S2 ) , conclusively demonstrating its suitability for VCV puriﬁca - tion . The second tool was the Jurkat T - cell line Jurkat E6 1 EGFP - Rab7 , which stably expressed an EGFP - Rab7 fusion protein , serving as a VCV marker to monitor the vacuole puriﬁcation process ( see Figs 1 and 2 ) . The immunomagnetic method for VCV puriﬁcation has one considerable ﬂaw in that VacA is not only exclusively situated on the VCV membrane but is also still bound to the plasma membrane ( see Fig . 1B ) . This is in contrast to the original Legionella protocol , which uses a bacterial effector protein exclusively present on the LCV mem - brane as target . An appropriate control consisting of cells treated with mutant VacA ( BG1 ) , or no VacA at all ( BG2 ) , was used to address this factor . The mutant VacA Δ 6 - 27 lacks 22 aa in its N - terminus , which are necessary for proper channel formation and therefore vacuolation , although cellular uptake still happens ( Vinion - Dubiel et al . , 1999 ) . Treatment of cells with this mutant toxin and their subjection to the VCV isolation protocol was expected to yield a puriﬁed fraction containing regular endocytic vesi - cles unaltered by VacA channel activity , and of course the aforementioned plasma membrane and other cell parts binding VacA . It was also expected to contain proteins unspeciﬁcally puriﬁed by the method , for instance proteins or cell parts that bind to the magnetic beads independent of the VacA toxin ( BG2 ) . These samples served as valu - able background controls for the MS analysis of VCVs . Fig . 7 .

B . Kern et al . 1822 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 The present study for the ﬁrst time performed a com - prehensive investigation of the VCV proteomic content by MS analysis , seeking to ﬁnd not only proteins that can be expected on an endocytic compartment , but various pro - teins involved in VacA intoxication effects . Two biological replicates of puriﬁed VCVs resulting from intoxication with wild - type VacA were measured . The results showed high variations between samples , with the ﬁrst ( WT1 ) returning 2096 protein hits and the second ( WT2 ) returning 1770 ( see Fig . 3A ) . The two samples overlapped for 1346 pro - teins . The numbers are comparable with the results reported for LCVs puriﬁed with the same method , and analysed on the same MS platform : around 1000 – 2000 host and Legionella proteins were identiﬁed , occurring once , twice or in all three preparations that were exam - ined ( Urwyler et al . , 2009 ; Hoffmann et al . , 2014 ) . Consid - ering only the proteins found in both wild - type samples ( 1346 ) and subtracting those found also in the back - ground sample ( 1224 ) leaves 122 proteins in the VCV - speciﬁc subset , which was used for further interpretation ( see Fig . 3A ) . It has to be noted that this method is not quantitative and therefore does not permit inferences about the amount of any particular protein present in a sample . To verify the MS results and to conﬁrm the pres - ence , the absence and the quantity of some candidate proteins , we choose two mitochondrial proteins ( ACO2 and MTG1 ) and two ER proteins ( CANX , ERN2 ) in differ - ent fractions of VCV puriﬁcation for Western blotting with speciﬁc antibodies ( Fig . S5A – C ) . The blots veriﬁed the absence or the presence of the corresponding proteins as detected by MS . The blotting data together with support - ing MS data ( Fig . S5D ) clearly show that deﬁned proteins from mitochondria and ER are associated with VCVs , rather than the complete organelles . Furthermore , Table 1 shows a list of proteins whose presence in the three MS samples is of special interest . This includes proteins that localize to VCVs , proteins that explicitly do not localize to VCVs , proteins that are required for VacA effects , proteins that are known not to be required for VacA effects and other proteins of signiﬁcance . In order to validate the different sets of proteins obtained by our VCV isolation approach , we compared our dataset with data obtained from literature . All but two proteins that are known to localize to VCVs were found in all MS samples : the small GTPase ( and puriﬁcation tool ) Rab7 ( Papini et al . , 1994 ) , the lysosomal markers Lamp1 and 2 ( Lamp2 is also known as Lgp110 ) ( Molinari et al . , 1997 ; Li et al . , 2004 ) , the vacuolar ATPase ( vATPase ) ( Papini et al . , 1996 ) , and the membrane fusion regulators Syntaxin - 7 and Vamp7 ( Suzuki et al . , 2003 ; Cover and Blanke , 2005 ; Mashima et al . , 2008 ) . The two exceptions are Rac1 , a signal transductor ( Hotchin et al . , 2000 ) , which was found in only one wild type and the background sample , and β - glucosaminidase , an LE / lysosomal enzyme ( Molinari et al . , 1997 ) , which was not found at all . Rab7 , vATPase , Vamp7 and Rac1 are also necessary for vacuolation ( Cover et al . , 1993 ; Papini et al . , 1993 ; 1997 ; Hotchin et al . , 2000 ; Mashima et al . , 2008 ) . The fact that virtually all proteins which are deﬁnitely known to be con - tained in VCVs were found in the MS measurements clearly validates the isolation technique . The most notable exception , β - glucosaminidase , was only reported to reside in VCVs in a single study that used baby hamster kidney cells , which could explain the disagreement . In addition , most proteins known not to localize to VCVs were not detected ( see Table 1 ) , showing that VCVs were successfully enriched by this method . The MS results were also scanned for individual pro - teins involved in VacA cell binding and internalization . Several protein receptors for VacA have previously been identiﬁed on different cell types , including EGFR , RPTP α / β , CD18 and Multimerin - 1 ( Seto et al . , 1998 ; Yahiro et al . , 1999 ; 2003 ; Sewald et al . , 2008 ; Satoh et al . , 2013 ) . None of these were detected in the wild - type VCV samples . In T cells , speciﬁcally , CD18 is known to mediate internalization as part of the lymphocyte function - associated antigen 1 ( LFA - 1 ) ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . Its absence can be explained by the fact that LFA - 1 is recy - cled back to the plasma membrane in Rab11 - positive structures . This suggests that after joint uptake , LFA - 1 ( and thus CD18 ) and VacA part ways . It is unknown when exactly this happens , but because cells were treated with VacA over night before VCV isolation , it is quite possible that differential sorting of LFA - 1 and VacA has already occurred at the point of cell homogenization . Other proteins involved in endocytic processes that have been investigated with regard to VacA uptake include tubulin ; the small GTPases Cdc42 , Arf6 and RhoA ; the RhoA - regulated kinases ROCK and MLCK ; several members of the protein kinase C family ( PKC ) ; the protease calpain ; and phosphoinositide 3 - kinase . Of these , calpain , PKC and Cdc42 are required for VacA uptake ( Gauthier et al . , 2005 ) . All three were detected in at least one wild - type sample ; Cdc42 is even in the VCV - speciﬁc subset . The exact differences of VacA and VacA Δ 6 - 27 uptake and transport need to be clariﬁed . Regarding VacA - induced apoptosis , the MS results reveal two out of three known mitochondrial effector pro - teins in the VCV - speciﬁc samples . The dynamin - related protein Drp1 and the multi - domain pro - apoptotic factors Bak and Bax are activated by VacA intoxication , leading to mitochondrial ﬁssion and cytochrome C release via two separate mechanisms , and , eventually , to apoptosis ( Calore et al . , 2010 ; Jain et al . , 2011 ) . Drp1 was found in the VCV - speciﬁc sample . We also studied the trafficking of VacA . Earlier reports on VacA trafficking performed in RK13 cells showed that the Golgi - disturbing agent brefeldin A increases VacA - containing vacuoles and Ca 2 + signalling 1823 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 VacA - induced vacuolation of epithelial cells , supporting the possibility that VacA could be transported to the Golgi apparatus ( Argent et al . , 2004 ) , which is supported by the earlier ﬁndings of Kuo and Wang ( 2003 ) , showing by confocal microscopy the colocalization of puriﬁed VacA from strain 60190 with the Golgi marker wheat germ agglutinin in Chinese hamster ovary cells . Our results from immunoﬂuorescence experiments conducted in HeLa cells conﬁrmed the presence of VacA in the ER and also found it to traffic to the Golgi apparatus , identifying these two cellular compartments as novel VacA target structures . The exact route of VacA transport remains unclear , but the involvement of both the ER and the Golgi suggests the possibility of retrograde trafficking , analo - gous to other bacterial toxins . As previous reports and research conducted during the course of this study demonstrated an inﬂuence of VacA on intracellular calcium signalling ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Gebert et al . , 2003 ; De Bernard et al . , 2005 ) , the MS results were also scanned for proteins involved in this process . Calcineurin , a phosphatase important in T - cell activation and reported to be inhibited during VacA intoxi - cation ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Gebert et al . , 2003 ) , was not detected in any of the samples . This is unsurprising because it is a cytoplasmic protein , and a direct interac - tion with VacA was never shown . Two very interesting proteins speciﬁcally involved in Ca 2 + signalling of T cells are STIM1 and ITPR3 , which both usually locate to the ER ( reviewed in Soboloff et al . , 2012 ; Fracchia et al . , 2013 ) . Our data further corroborate VacA’s role in calcium signalling . SOCE is deﬁned as the inﬂux of calcium into the cytosol from the extracellular milieu caused by the depletion of intracellular calcium stores , for instance the ER . A main player in this process , especially in T cells , is the STIM1 , which localizes to the ER membrane and senses the calcium concentration in the ER lumen . Upon calcium depletion , STIM1 clusters in so - called puncta and relo - cates to ER – plasma membrane junctions . There , it inter - acts with and activates the plasma membrane - situated SOCE channel protein ORAI1 , which then opens to let Ca 2 + into the cytosol ( reviewed in Soboloff et al . , 2012 ) . The expression of both STIM1 and ORAI1 is up - regulated during T - cell activation ( Lioudyno et al . , 2008 ) , conﬁrming their substantial role in this process . VacA was shown to colocalize with STIM1 ( Fig . 5E ) but not with the ORAI1 Ca 2 + channel protein in the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5F ) . Furthermore , a signiﬁcant degree of colocalization occurred between mCherry - STIM1 and EGFP - myc - ORAI1 in cells containing relatively little VacA - Alexa647 after thapsigargin treatment ( Fig . 6B ) . However , less colocalization occurred between mCherry - STIM1 and EGFP - myc - ORAI1 the cells with more internalized VacA - Alexa647 ( Fig . 6C ) . The data suggest that VacA may interfere with STIM1 , or with STIM1 / ORAI1 coupling during the process of calcium store depletion ( Fig . 6B and C ) . This , also for the ﬁrst time , demonstrated a possible localization of VacA to the ER . Because SOCE - induced high intracellular calcium levels are required for calcineurin activity , an interference of VacA with SOCE offers a new possible explanation for calcineurin inhibition . The present study attempted for the ﬁrst time to isolate VCVs from T cells and to analyse the protein content of VCVs to ﬁnd out whether VCVs are only a by - product of VacA intoxication , or whether they have a purpose . Fur - thermore , VacA trafficking and intracellular localization has mainly been studied in epithelial cells and it is not clear whether it is similar in T lymphocytes . However , the idea that VCVs do in fact have a purpose is particularly supported by four previous experimental ﬁndings : ( 1 ) VacA greatly alters vesicular trafficking ( Satin et al . , 1997 ; Molinari et al . , 1998 ; Li et al . , 2004 ) ; ( 2 ) VacA causes changes in the protein content of endocytic compartments in intoxicated cells ( Molinari et al . , 1997 ) , both indicating more than simple toxin endocytosis ; ( 3 ) VacA - containing vesicles acquire an actin tail that propels them through the cell cytoplasm ( Gauthier et al . , 2007 ) ; and ( 4 ) physical proximity of VacA - containing vesicles and mitochondria may explain how VacA reaches mitochondria ( Calore et al . , 2010 ) , and may be how VacA gets to other , yet unknown , sites of action . These activities of VacA have been summarized in an updated model ( Fig . 8 ) . Our data show that VCVs apparently consisted not only of typical endosomal proteins , clearly indicating a purpose for VCVs . The exact nature of this purpose is an intriguing subject for further study . An important part of this will be the validation of the presence of individual proteins on VCVs with special focus on VCVs as putative signalling platforms . Numerous proteins involved in known VacA intoxication effects were detected in VCV preparations , and their validation will strengthen the connections between VacA effects and their underlying cellular path - ways . Of particular interest are proteins that are impli - cated in cellular calcium homeostasis ( including STIM1 and ITPR3 ) , the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway ( includ - ing Drp1 and Bak ) and intracellular signalling and traffick - ing processes , which may all contribute to immune modulation by VacA . The VCV isolation procedure and our ﬁrst VCV proteome analysis may therefore also prove to be a valuable tool to interconnect existing knowledge about VacA and its effects . Experimental procedures Cultivation of bacterial strains and cell line maintenance All cell lines were maintained at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 with the appropriate media as indicated in Table S1 and subcultured B . Kern et al . 1824 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 every 2 – 3 days . Generally , cells were grown in 75 cm 2 tissue culture ﬂasks ( BD Falcon ) and in 6 - , 12 - and 24 - well plates ( tissue culture treated cell culture clusters , Costar , Corning Inc . ) . Transfection of Jurkat E6 - 1 cells and production of a stable Jurkat E6 - 1 EGFP - Rab7 cell line Jurkat E6 - 1 cells were transfected by electroporation using the Amaxa Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V and a Nucleofector I device ( both Lonza ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for this cell line . Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) medium for transfected cells was supplemented with additional additives . Transfection efficiency was examined via microscopy ( Leica TCS SP5 ) or ﬂow cytometry ( FACSCanto II , BD Biosciences ) . Plasmid pEGFP - C1 Rab7A codes for an EGFP - Rab7 fusion protein and a G418 resistance cassette . In order to perform selection of transfected cells with G418 , the antibiotic tolerance of untransfected wild - type Jurkat E6 - 1 cells was examined by treating cells with varying concentrations of G418 ( 0 – 1 . 4 mg ml − 1 in steps of 0 . 2 mg ml − 1 ) . Aconcentration of 1 mg ml − 1 was chosen for selection and applied to cells 24 – 48 h after transfection . To enrich EGFP - Rab7 expressing cells , the mixed culture was sub - jected to cell sorting via ﬂow cytometry . Because cell sorting took place in a non - sterile environment , a mixture of penicillin and Recruitment of host cell proteins Downstream eﬀects ? ER Inﬂuence on Ca 2 + signaling Cellular membrane VacA monomer Receptor VacA channel Retrograde transport ? ? EE Fig . 8 . VacA uptake , intracellular trafficking and effects . This diagram shows a general overview of what happens after VacA encounters a host cell , starting at the top with VacA binding to the cell surface receptors and channel formation . VacA is endocytosed into GIP - AP - enriched early endosomal compartments and then transported to early endosomes ( EE ) carrying the EE marker Rab5 . These associate with polymerized actin structures ( depicted in green ) that move them through the cytosol . VacA - containing endocytic compartments can be found in close proximity to mitochondria , where VacA inserts into the inner mitochondrial membrane ( IMM ) and induces apoptosis . Directed trafficking of VacA to other cellular organelles might also occur . Most VacA , however , accumulates in late endosomes ( LE ) carrying the LE marker Rab7 . In the presence of weak bases , VacA causes the swelling of these compartments to easily visible , large vacuoles by forming a channel in the LE membrane . It is conceivable that VCVs then proceed to recruit host cell proteins and in this fashion , or otherwise , cause the other known VacA effects . In this study a possible VacA transport to the ER and the Golgi apparatus is shown for the ﬁrst time . In which order VacA travels through these compartments and vacuoles is still unclear . VacA - containing vacuoles and Ca 2 + signalling 1825 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 streptomycin was added to the cells after sorting to avoid bacte - rial contamination ( ﬁnal concentrations 100 U ml − 1 and 100 μ g ml − 1 respectively ) . Puriﬁcation of VacA To produce large amounts of VacA , H . pylori was grown in sequential liquid cultures of 30 – 250 ml for total ﬁnal culture volumes of about 1 l . These cultures typically had a ﬁnal OD 550 of around 0 . 35 and were harvested by centrifugation ( 6000 × g , 20 min , 4°C ) . All further steps were performed at 4°C or on ice . The cell pellet was discarded and the supernatant , containing the secreted toxin , was sterile ﬁltrated ( Nalgene Rapid - Flow Sterile Disposable Bottle Top Filters with PES Membrane , 0 . 45 μ m pore size , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . VacA was precipitated by the slow addition of one volume of cold , saturated ammonium sulfate solution under continuous slow stirring . After 4 – 16 h of further stirring , the precipitate was sedimented by centrifugation ( 20 000 × g , 30 min , 4°C ) and thoroughly resuspended in a total volume of 30 ml cold phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . Sample volume was reduced to 4 ml with a centrifugal ﬁlter unit ( Amicon Ultra , Ultracel , 100K MWCO , Millipore ) ( 4000 × g , 4°C ) to simplify gel ﬁltration , which was carried out with a Sephacryl S300 16 / 60 column on an ÄKTA explorer system ( Amersham Biosciences , GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) , using a running buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM NaPO 4 at pH 7 . 4 . The resulting frac - tions were examined for purity via SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining , pooled accordingly and again concentrated by centrifu - gation to a ﬁnal volume of about 1 – 1 . 5 ml . The ﬁnal protein concentration was determined in a Bradford assay and usually ranged between 0 . 4 and 1 mg ml − 1 in a volume of 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 ml . For every preparation of VacA , the toxin’s activity was tested in a vacuolation assay . After puriﬁcation , VacA is oligomeric and thus biologically inactive . Before all intoxication experiments , puriﬁed VacA was therefore acid activated . This was carried out by adding 0 . 2 volumes of 0 . 3 M HCl , incubating at 37°C for 20 – 30 min , and neutralizing with 0 . 2 volumes of 0 . 3 M NaOH . Labelling of VacA with Alexa dyes Puriﬁed VacA was labelled with different Alexa ﬂuorophores obtained from Invitrogen , using either the Alexa Fluor 647 Mono - clonal Antibody Labelling Kit or individually bought Alexa Fluor carboxylic acid succinimidyl esters . The kit was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions while the separate dyes were used following a modiﬁed protocol . The desiccated dye was resuspended in 100 μ l MeOH for aliquoting into four portions and re - dried in a vacuum concentrator . A total of 112 μ g VacA was mixed with 50 μ l 1 M NaHCO 3 before adding PBS ( – ) ( 7 . 7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 . 5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 150 mM NaCl ) to a total volume of 500 μ l . One portion of dye ( 250 μ g ) per labelling reaction was solved in 20 μ l dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the mix , which was then incubated at RT in the dark for 45 min under gentle agitation . To remove unbound dye , the sample was extensively dialysed against PBS ( – ) at 4°C ( over night against 4 l and another 4 h against 1 l ) in Slide - A - Lyzer dialysis cassettes ( 100K MWCO , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Protein concentration and degree of labelling were assessed using a NanoDrop ND - 1000 spectrometer according to Invitrogen’s instructions , and toxin activity was assayed via neutral red uptake . Vacuolation assay Cytotoxic activity of newly prepared VacA , or activity of labelled VacA , was conﬁrmed in a vacuolation assay . The fact that VacA - induced vacuoles can be stained with neutral red enables the quantiﬁcation of toxin activity via neutral red uptake . This assay was performed on HeLa cells with a conﬂuency of 70 – 90 % , usually seeded 1 or 2 days before the experiment in 12 - well tissue culture plates . VacA was acid activated and added to cells to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 μ g ml − 1 . As a non - intoxicated control , one well was treated with ‘acid - activated’ water instead of VacA . After 4 h of incubation , NH 4 Cl was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mM to enlarge vacuoles ( 30 – 60 min ) . The cell medium was then replaced with RPMI supplemented with 10 % FCS ( fetal calf serum ) and 1 : 50 neutral red solution ( 0 . 4 % in PBS , Merck ) . After another 10 min , the cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0 . 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . The neutral red taken up into vacuoles was then extracted with 70 % ethanol / 0 . 37 % HCl and its absorbance was measured in a 96 - well plate ( Costar EIA / RIA plate , ﬂat well , medium binding , Corning ) at 534 nm ( reference wavelength 405 nm ) using a Tecan Sunrise microplate reader . Alternatively , neutral red was added directly to a small aliquot of intoxicated cells and vacuolation was conﬁrmed via microscopy . Production of α - VacA nat An antiserum was raised against puriﬁed , native VacA in a rabbit by Gramsch Laboratories according to their standardized proto - col . Brieﬂy , puriﬁed VacA was injected on day 1 and 21 ( 75 μ g , in dorsum , neck and shoulder ) and again on day 42 , 49 and 56 ( 50 μ g , intramuscularly in the hind thigh ) . Serum was taken on day 63 ( boost # 1 ) and on day 70 ( boost # 2 ) , stabilized with azide and received from Gramsch Laboratories . The second boost was named AK297 ( α - VacA _ nat ) and characterized for this work . In addition , pre - immune serum of the same animal was used for comparison . Immunostaining experiments To investigate the localization of VacA in intoxicated HeLa cells , cells were treated with Alexa - labelled VacA and subsequently stained for Golgi apparatus marker giantin and ER marker CANX . Similarly , co - intoxication with VacA and cholera toxin subunit B ( CTxB ) , both ﬂuorescently labelled , was performed . Moreover , to further characterize the new antibody α - VacA _ nat , it was used to stain Alexa - labelled VacA in intoxicated HeLa cells . Using a sec - ondary antibody labelled with a different ﬂuorophore than the one coupled to VacA facilitated a direct comparison of the signals of the immunostain with that of labelled VacA . A total of 50 000 cells were seeded onto untreated glass coverslips ( Menzel - Gläser , 12 mm , Omnilab ) in 24 - well plates on the day before the experiment . Before intoxication , the cell medium was changed to ensure equal volumes of 500 μ l in each well . Three microlitres of VacA - Alexa488 or 2 μ l of VacA - Alexa568 ( all acid - activated ) was applied per well ; this had pre - viously been titrated as the ideal volumes for these batches of labelled VacA . CTxB - Alexa555 ( Molecular Probes , Life Technolo - gies ) was applied at a concentration of 1 . 6 μ g ml − 1 . Samples were kept in the dark as much as possible to avoid ﬂuorophore bleaching and washed three times with PBS between treatments B . Kern et al . 1826 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 and antibody incubation steps . Intoxication was performed for 4 h at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 , as usual , but all subsequent incubation steps were carried out at room temperature and normal atmos - phere . Cells were ﬁxed with PFA ( 4 % in PBS , 20 min ) , followed by permeabilization with Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 1 % in PBS , 10 min ) and a blocking step with blocking buffer ( 8 % calf serum in PBS , 30 min ) . Coverslips were then sequentially incubated with 70 μ l primary and secondary antibody solution on paraﬁlm for 50 – 60 min . After a ﬁnal wash , the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using VectaShield mounting medium ( Vector Labo - ratories ) supplemented with 1 μ g ml − 1 DAPI ( 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) and ﬁxed with nail polish . Antibodies used and their respective concentrations can be found in Table S2 . Microscopy and image analysis Microscopy samples were examined with a Leica TCS SP5 con - focal microscope . Routine image processing was carried out with ImageJ 1 . 45h ( National Institutes of Health ) , while Volocity 6 . 0 . 1 ( PerkinElmer ) was used for colocalization analyses . Homogenization of Jurkat E6 - 1 cells For various purposes , most notably for all approaches of VCV isolation , Jurkat E6 - 1 cells were homogenized using a ball homogenizer ( Isobiotec ) and an exclusion size of 10 μ m . Cells were handled on ice for the entire procedure and washed twice with cold PBS before being centrifuged ( 250 × g , 5 min ) and resuspended in PBS * ( exemplarily , 10 7 cells were washed with 2 × 10 ml and resuspended in 3 ml ) . The cell suspension was transferred to disposable 3 ml Luer Lok syringes ( BD Biosciences ) and passaged nine times through the ball homogenizer , which had previously been washed with distilled water and ﬂushed with PBS * . The homogenate was cleared of intact cells and large debris particles by centrifugation ( 200 × g , 10 min , 4°C ) before being processed further . Isolation of VCVs by immunomagnetic separation Generally , the protocol for the isolation of VCVs was adapted from Urwyler et al . ( 2010 ) and modiﬁed as needed . For the purpose of MS analysis of VCVs , eight 75 cm 2 ﬂasks of cells ( corresponding to approximately 8 × 10 7 cells ) were used . The following protocol describes this scale of experiment . Jurkat E6 - 1 EGFP - Rab7 cells were intoxicated with VacA ( 1 μ g ml − 1 ) with simultaneous administration of NH 4 Cl and incubated overnight . Starting with homogenization , all steps were carried out on ice or at 4°C . The homogenate was blocked with 2 % calf serum ( 30 min ) and then incubated with α - VacA _ nat ( 1 : 500 , 1 h ) . A centrifugation step was performed to remove primary antibody ( 3000 × g , 30 min ) and the pellet was resuspended in 4 ml PBS * . MACS Anti - Rabbit IgG MicroBeads ( Miltenyi ) were added at 1 : 15 and incubated once more for 30 min ( all binding incubation steps were performed under gentle agitation ) . The beads were then applied to three MACS MS separation columns ( Miltenyi ) equili - brated with 0 . 5 ml PBS * . After sample binding , the columns were washed twice with 0 . 5 ml PBS * and elution was achieved by removing the column from the magnetic holder and pressing with the supplied piston . Intact cells , homogenate , column ﬂowthrough and eluate were examined by microscopy and SDS - PAGE to monitor the proce - dure . For microscopy , 200 / 200 / 33 / 13 μ l of the respective fraction was applied to an 8 - well slide ( μ - Slide 8 well ibiTreat microscopy chamber , Ibidi ) in a total volume of at least 200 μ l per well , centrifuged ( 600 × g , 10 min , 4°C ) and analysed shortly thereaf - ter . Proportions of the individual fractions were kept similar to facilitate comparison of samples with respect to VCV numbers . For SDS - PAGE , the same fractions ( 250 / 250 / 750 / 750 μ l , respec - tively ) were processed by centrifugation ( 15 000 × g , 10 min , 4°C ) , resuspension in 50 μ l 2 × SDS sample buffer and boiling . Twenty microlitres of each fraction was applied to SDS - PAGE . In this case , unequal proportions of the individual fractions were used to ensure that protein would be visible in all samples after Coomassie staining for comparison of protein composition . Finally , for analysis by MS , 750 μ l of eluate was centrifuged ( 15 000 × g , 10 min , 4°C ) and the supernatant was removed . The sample was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at − 70°C until it was shipped to the MS facility on dry ice . Mass spectrometry MS analysis of isolated vacuoles was performed as detailed in Hoffmann et al . ( 2014 ) . In brief , VCVs were subjected to a GeLCMS analysis by ﬁrst resolving the proteins by 1D - SDS - PAGE . The gel lanes were cut in 10 pieces of equal size and subjected to trypsin digestion . The tryptic peptides were sepa - rated by reversed phase column chromatography using an EASYnLC ( Proxeon ) with self - packed columns in a 70 min binary gradient . The LC was coupled online to a LTQ - Velos Orbitrap MS ( Thermo Fisher ) . After a survey scan in the Orbitrap ( R = 30 000 ) , MS / MS data were recorded for the 20 most intensive precursor ions in the linear ion trap . Following acquisition of the GeLCMS data , spectra were sub - jected to database searching via the Software Sorcerer using Sequest ( version 27 , revision 11 ; SageN ) . Database searching was adjusted according to the organism of vacuole origin , using the human UniProt database . Databases were used as target / decoy databases with a list of common contaminants added . Sequest was used assuming trypsinization with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 1 . 00 Da and a search tolerance of 10 p . p . m . for the overview scans . Oxidation of methionine was speciﬁed in Sequest as a variable modiﬁcation . Scaffold ( version 3 . 5 . 1 , Proteome Software Inc . ) was used to ﬁlter and validate MS / MS - based peptide and protein identiﬁca - tions . Peptide identiﬁcations were accepted when spectra exceeded Xcorr values of 2 . 2 , 3 . 3 and 3 . 8 for doubly , triply and quadruply peptides with deltaCN values of more than 0 . 1 . Protein identiﬁcations are based on at least two unique peptides . Pro - teins that contained similar peptides and could not be differenti - ated based on MS / MS analysis alone were grouped to meet the principle of parsimony . MS data processing The results of the MS tests were obtained in the form of Excel ﬁles with the names of proteins matching identiﬁed peptides and corresponding UniProt accession numbers . Protein information was retrieved from UniProt using these accession numbers , and analysis was restricted to reviewed ( Swiss - Prot ) entries . The VacA - containing vacuoles and Ca 2 + signalling 1827 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 proteins’ subcellular location was taken directly from UniProt’s subcellular location column , whereas information about proteins’ biological process was extracted from the Gene Ontology ( GO ) column and the GO tree provided at the UniProt web page . Immunoblotting ( Western blot ) Membranes were incubated in blocking solution ( 5 % skim milk in TBS ) for at least 1 h to saturate unspeciﬁc binding sites . Primary and secondary antibodies were applied as detailed in the table below . Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated for at least 1 . 5 h at RT ( or for longer periods at 4 °C ) , whereas secondary antibodies were diluted in 1 % skim milk in TBS and incubated for 45 – 60 min at RT . After antibody incubation steps , membranes were washed with TBS - T ( tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 075 % Tween 20 ) , usually three times for 7 min each . Addition of substrate ( Immobilon Chemiluminescent HRP Sub - strate , Millipore ) initiates a chemiluminescence reaction that is catalysed by horseradish peroxidase bound to the secondary antibody . This reaction was detected with X - ray ﬁlms ( Fuji Medical X - Ray Films Super RX , Fujiﬁlm ) or via a Bio - Rad ChemiDoc XRS . Isolation of human CD4 + T lymphocytes Human CD4 + T lymphocytes were isolated by positive selection with the MACS technology . The puriﬁed PBLC were obtained in the cell density of 1 × 10 7 cells per 80 μ l of MACS buffer . To the cell density of 1 × 10 7 , 20 μ l of MACS CD4 + microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) was added , and the cells were incubated for 15 min at 4°C withshaking . Thecellswerethenwashedwith20 mlMACSbuffer , resuspended in 1 ml MACS buffer and applied to MACS buffer equilibrated column LS , combined with MidiMACS™ Separator . The column was then washed with two times 4 ml each MACS buffer . The column was then removed from MidiMACS™ Separa - tor to elute the cells with 3 ml MACS buffer . The cells were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min and resuspended in 10 ml RPMI supplemented with 10 % FCS . Cells were seeded with cell density of 1 × 10 6 cells per millilitre MACS buffer ( PBS , 0 . 5 % BSA , 2 mM EDTA ) . Calcium assay Fluo - 4 NW calcium assay solution was prepared by mixing com - ponent A ( Fluo - 4 NW dye mix ) , component B ( probenecid ) and component C ( 1 × Hank’s buffered salt solution , 20 mM HEPES ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . After mixing all the components , the solution was kept at 4°C for 30 min . Cells were incubated in black , clear bottom , sterile 96 - well poly - D - lysine coated plates . In order to evaluate the effect of VacA in Jurkat E6 . 1 cells / CD4 + T cells , cells ( 1 . 75 × 10 6 cells ml − 1 ) were pre - incubated with puriﬁed acid activated wild - type VacA and Δ 6 - 27VacA ( VacA M ) ( 2 and 0 . 25 μ g ml − 1 ) for 3 h and loaded with Fluo - 4 NW calcium assay dye for further 1 h at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . The cells were then evaluated by ﬂuorescence measure - ment . In the ﬁrst step , the baseline ﬂuorescence was measured for 10 cycles . Thapsigargin at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 μ M was then added and immediately evaluated by ﬂuorescence meas - urement for 120 cycles . The ﬂuorescence measurement was performed for excitation at 494 nm and emission at 516 nm in ﬂuorescence microplate reader ( FLUOstar OPTIMA ) . Live cell imaging HEK - 293 cells ( 0 . 5 × 10 6 cells ml − 1 ) expressing mCherry - STIM1 , or eGFP - myc - ORAI1 , or both , were incubated in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) with 1 μ g ml − 1 acid activated VacA labelled with Alexa 647 for 4 h at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were washed carefully once with 1 ml PBS , resuspended in DMEM and live cell imaging was performed . First , the cells were visualized without thapsigargin treatment . Next , thapsigargin at a concentration of 1 μ M was added and eGFP expression was analysed by excitation / emission at 488 / 509 nm , mCherry at 587 / 610 nm and Alexa 647 dye at 652 / 668 nm . Live cell experiments were performed with an Ultra - View LCI spinning disk confocal system ( PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences ) ﬁtted on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a temperature - and CO 2 - controllable environment chamber .

Generation of the stable cell line Jurkat E6 - 1 EGFP - Rab7 . Rab7 is a late endosomal marker known to line VCV membranes . A . Jurkat E6 - 1 EGFP - Rab7 cells exhibiting vacuolation after intoxication with VacA and treatment with NH4Cl for at least 4 / 1 h respectively . VCVs can be seen in the bright ﬁeld image ( top ) and labelled with EGFP - Rab7 in the green channel ( bottom ) . Scale bar represents 10 μ m . B . Expression of EGFP - Rab7 in stably transfected Jurkat E6 - 1 cells was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry . The grey area represents wild - type ( untransfected ) Jurkat E6 - 1 cells . The stable cell line was subjected to cell sorting and analysed before ( black line ) and afterwards ( green line ) , clearly showing an enrichment in EGFP - Rab7 expressing cells . C . The bar graph shows mean ﬂuorescence intensity ( MFI ) ( geo - metric mean ) calculated from the measurements obtained in panel ( B ) . Both panels ( B ) and ( C ) illustrate one representative experiment . Fig . S2 . Puriﬁcation of VacA and characterization of α - VacA _ nat . A . Helicobacter pylori 60190 culture supernatant was mixed with 50 % ammonium sulfate and the precipitated proteins were sub - jected to gel ﬁltration on a Sephacryl S300 column . The blue line represents protein eluting from the column , measured via the proteins’ absorption at 280 nm ( mAU = milli absorbance unit ) . The eluted fractions ( indicated in red ) were applied to a 10 % SDS - PAGE and Coomassie stained . VacA bands can be seen just below 100 kDa . Fractions containing VacA at sufficient quan - tity and purity were then pooled and concentrated . B . Puriﬁed VacA was spotted directly onto membrane to preserve its native conformation and subsequently analysed by immunoblotting with both VacA antisera . C . Lysates of different H . pylori strains as well as puriﬁed VacA from strain 60190 were analysed by Western blotting with α - VacA _ rec and α - VacA _ nat to compare the two antisera’s ability to recognize different VacA variants ( bands detected at approx . 100 kDa ) . D . Various antisera , including those raised against VacA ( α - VacA _ rec and α - VacA _ nat ) , were tested for their ability to inhibit VacA - induced vacuolation in HeLa cells . Pre - immune serum ( PIS ) , α - RecA and α - BabA were used as unspeciﬁc con - trols . All sera were heat inactivated to reduce complement effects and incubated with acid - activated VacAbefore intoxication . Vacu - olation was measured via neutral red uptake after 4 h of intoxi - cation and 1 h of NH 4 Cl treatment . All values were normalized to untreated cells and uninhibited vacuolation was set to 100 % . Error bars represent standard errors of the mean of three inde - pendent experiments . E . HeLa cells were intoxicated with VacA - Alexa568 for 4 h and subsequently stained with α - VacA _ nat ( and a secondary anti - body labelled with Alexa488 ) so that both signals could be com - pared directly . Samples were analysed by confocal microscopy . Scale bar represents 10 μ m . Fig . S3 . Optimization of VCV isolation conditions . A . As an indicator for vacuolation over time , neutral red uptake was measured in Jurkat E6 - 1 cells after 4 , 8 and 24 h of intoxication with VacA and parallel treatment with NH 4 Cl . Meas - urements were normalized to unintoxicated cells . The graph was compiled with data obtained in three independent experi - ments . Error bars represent standard errors of the mean . * P < 0 . 05 ( Kruskal – Wallis and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests ) . B . To investigate VCV sedimentation properties , Jurkat E6 - 1 EGFP - Rab7 cells were intoxicated with VacA and treated with NH 4 Cl ( both 5 h ) before homogenization . One microlitre of homogenate was then sequentially centrifuged . One - ﬁfth of cen - trifugation pellets was loaded onto an SDS - PAGE and subse - quently analysed for the presence of VacA and EGFP - Rab7 by Western blotting . VacA - containing vacuoles and Ca 2 + signalling 1831 © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd , Cellular Microbiology , 17 , 1811 – 1832 C . Different buffers were tested for homogenization of intoxi - cated , NH 4 Cl - treated Jurkat E6 - 1 EGFP - Rab7 cells . VCVs are clearly in a better condition in PBS * .
