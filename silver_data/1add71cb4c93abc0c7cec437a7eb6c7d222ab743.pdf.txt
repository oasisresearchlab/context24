IRTKS is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation . However , the mechanism and function of IRTKS phosphorylation remains unclear . Here , we report that overexpression of IRTKS increases the speed of wound closure of HT1080 cells in a Src - dependent manner . Active Src phosphorylates IRTKS in vivo and in vitro . Deletion mapping and mutation analysis revealed that six tyrosine residues ( Y37 , Y156 , Y163 , Y274 , Y293 and Y439 ) were Src - stimulated phosphorylation sites on IRTKS . Disrup - tion of Src - stimulated IRTKS phosphorylation abolished the effect of IRTKS on wound closure . Col - lectively , these data suggest Src - stimulated IRTKS phosphorylation is essential for its function in cell motility . (cid:2) 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies .

Introduction The IRSp53 family of proteins is involved in signal transduction pathways that link actin remodeling and membrane protrusion [ 1 ] . The IRSp53 family protein , insulin receptor tyrosine kinase sub - strate ( IRTKS ) , has a wide tissue distribution and has been charac - terized as a substrate of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase [ 2 ] . IRTKS contains an inverted Bin – amphipysin – Rvs167 ( I - BAR ) domain ( also known as IMD ) in its N - terminus , a canonical Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domaininitscentralregionandaWW - binding ( WWB ) domainnear its C - terminus . I - BAR domain deforms the membranes into tubular structures and induces plasma membrane protrusions , such as ﬁlo - podia and microspikes [ 3 – 6 ] . Both the SH3 and WWB domains are involved in protein interactions . The proteins associated with the SH3 domain of IRTKS have not been characterized , but the SH3 do - main of IRSp53 was shown to bind to N - WASP and other proteins which are involved in actin polymerization and ﬁlopodia formation [ 1 , 7 ] . A recent study demonstrated that the WWB domain is re - quired for the association of IRSp53 with Eps8 [ 8 ] . Actin polymerization and membrane deformation are important processes for cell mobility [ 9 ] . IRSp53 family proteins contribute to actin dynamics and the development of membrane protrusions for generating ﬁlopodia [ 7 , 10 ] . While IRSp53 overexpression results intheformationofmanylong , oftenwavy , ﬁlopodia - likeextensions , overexpression of IRTKS induces the formation of numerous actin microspikes at the cell periphery [ 2 ] . Filopodia and lamellipodia have been shown to be important in the context of cell invasion and metastasis [ 11 ] . Funato et al . [ 12 ] reported that inhibition of association of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex suppressed motility and invasiveness in HT1080 cells , suggesting that IRSp53 family pro - teins could be involved in cell motility . Both IRSp53 and IRTKS rapidly undergo tyrosine phosphoryla - tion in insulin - treated cells [ 2 , 13 ] . Increased tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of IRSp53 was also observed in cells expressing a transforming chicken c - Src ( mutant Phe - 527 ) , or in cells treated with insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( IGF - 1 ) or epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) [ 14 , 15 ] Recent studies revealed that serine / threonine phosphorylation of IRSp53 regulated IRSp53 - dependent ﬁlopodial dynamics by pro - moting the association of IRSp53 and 14 - 3 - 3 protein [ 16 , 17 ] . How - ever , little is known about the mechanism and function of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRTKS . Src is the prototypic member of a family of non - receptor membrane - associated tyrosine kinases [ 18 ] . The Src family of tyro - sinekinases ( SFKs ) controlsmultiplecellularfunctionsincludingcell proliferation , cellcycleprogression , celldeath , differentiation , adhe - sion , migration and invasion [ 19 ] . Src is both a substrate and an up - stream activator of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , thereby creating a positive - regulatory loop that contributes to the robust - ness and persistence of RTK signaling [ 20 ] . During cell migration and invasion , Src exerts a profound effect on the reorganization of thecytoskeletonandonadhesionsystems [ 21 ] . Inthisstudy , therole of Src in IRTKS phosphorylation , the tyrosine residues involved in Src - mediated phosphorylation of IRTKS and the effect of Src - stimu - lated IRTKS phosphorylation on cell motility were investigated . 0014 - 5793 / $ 36 . 00 (cid:2) 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies .

The reaction supernatant and pro - tein G sepharose beads were then separated by centrifugation . The supernatant was used to detect the phosphorylation of IRTKS . Src protein precipitated with Src antibody and protein G sepharose beads was also analyzed by western blotting . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . IRTKS enhances cell migration in a Src - dependent manner To examine the role of IRTKS in cell motility , a stable HT1080 cell line , HT1080 - A8 , which expressed ectopic IRTKS upon with - drawal of Tet ( Fig . 1A ) , was used . HT1080 - A8 cells or wild - type HT1080 cells grew as monolayers in the presence or absence of Tet . The cells were scratched and monitored for wound healing over time . As shown in Fig . S1 , Tet could not alter the speed of wound closure of wild - type HT1080 cells . However , the Tet - off HT1080 - A8 cells in which IRTKS was overexpressed migrated markedly faster than the control cells ( Fig . 1B ) . The wound healing rate of HT1080 - A8 cells was signiﬁcantly increased by the induc - ible expression of IRTKS at 24 h ( Fig . 1C , P < 0 . 001 ) . Recently , Liu et al . reported that IRSp53 inﬂuences v - Src - elicited proliferation and tumorigenesis through the association between IRSp53 and Eps8 [ 8 ] , suggesting IRSp53 family proteins may partic - ipate in Src signaling . Src plays a pivotal role in cell migration [ 21 ] . To explore whether Src also controls cell migration induced by IRTKS , we depleted Src expression in HT1080 - A8 cells by introducing a siRNA for Src ( Fig . 1E ) . Depletion of Src slightly de - creased HT1080 - A8 cell migration in the presence of Tet ( Fig . 1D , upper two panels ; and Fig . 1F , ⁄⁄ P > 0 . 5 ) . However , in HT1080 - A8 cells cultured in medium without Tet , the increase in cell migration induced by IRTKS overexpression was signiﬁcantly inhibited by siSrc , suggesting that Src controls IRTKS - enhanced cell mobility ( Fig . 1D , lower two panels ; and Fig . 1F , ⁄ P < 0 . 001 ) . 3 . 2 . IRTKS is a substrate of Src The protein tyrosine kinase Src catalyzes the transfer of the ter - minal phosphate group of ATP to speciﬁc tyrosine residues present on protein substrates , and thereby transfers signals downstream of a variety of cell surface receptors , including integrins and RTKs [ 19 ] . A previous study reported that IRTKS could be phosphorylated upon insulin stimulation [ 2 ] .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRTKS truncation mutants is indicated by an asterisk . G . Chen et al . / FEBS Letters 585 ( 2011 ) 2972 – 2978 2975 phosphorylation of IRTKS ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , IRTKS is highly phosphorylated in some cells , including H1299 , HT1080 and Hep3B cells , while phosphorylation of IRTKS was hardly de - tected in U2OS and HeLa cells ( Fig . S2 ) . Our experiments revealed that Src controls IRTKS - induced cell migration in HT1080 cells which possess highly phosphorylated IRTKS , therefore , we tested whether Src kinase activity inﬂuences IRTKS phosphorylation . In HT1080 cells treated with Src siRNA , tyrosine phosphorylation of IRTKS was signiﬁcantly decreased ( Fig . 2A ) . Moreover , a speciﬁc inhibitor of the Src family kinase , PP2 , inhibited IRTKS phosphoryla - tion in H1299 cells ( Fig . 2B ) . When a construct expressing a consti - tutively active Src mutant , Src 530F , was transfected into U2OS cells , phosphorylation of IRTKS was dramatically enhanced ( Fig . 2C ) . Taken together , these data indicated that active Src could induce IRTKS phosphorylation in vivo . We then puriﬁed active Src from U2OS cells transfected with Src 530F and recombinant IRTKS protein expressed in E . coli , and performed an in vitro kinase assay . The results showed that Src could phosphorylate IRTKS in vitro ( Fig . 2D ) , suggesting that IRTKS is a direct substrate of Src . 3 . 3 . Domain mapping of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites in IRTKS We next analyzed the tyrosine residues of IRTKS required for Src - induced phosphorylation . IRTKS contains 15 tyrosine residues , most of which are located in its functional domains ( Fig . 3A and Fig . S3A ) . Point mutations of each individual tyrosine residue did not abolish IRTKS phosphorylation ( data not shown ) , suggesting that IRTKS has multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites . Previous studies have characterized the sequence requirements for phos - phorylation of IRSp53 in response to stimulation with insulin or EGF . Okamura - Oho et al . [ 24 ] reported that the simultaneous mutation of three tyrosine residues in the I - BAR domain ( Y17 , Y115 , Y178 ) abrogated IRSp53 phosphorylation induced by insulin or IGF - 1 , suggesting that the phosphorylation of IRSp53 may occur within the I - BAR domain . In another study , Heung et al . demonstrated that tyrosine residues in the I - BAR domain were not required for IRSp53 phosphorylation , and that tyrosine 310 in IRSp53 was the primary site of tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin signaling [ 15 ] . Moreover , EGF receptor - induced phosphorylation of IRSp53 has been shown to be distinct from that of insulin receptor - induced phosphorylation , suggesting that IRSp53 contains multiple phosphor - tyrosine sites [ 15 ] . To investigate the signiﬁcance of different domains or frag - ments of IRTKS with respect to tyrosine phosphorylation , we gen - erated IRTKS truncations ( Fig . 3A ) . Interestingly , all truncated fragments of IRTKS could be phosphorylated by Src ( Fig . 3B ) , sug - gesting that IRTKS contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its different regions . The IRTKS N - terminal truncation , IRTKS - D1 which contains the whole I - BAR domain , and the IRTKS C - terminal truncation , IRTKS - D5 which contains the SH3 domain and the WWB domain , were used for further experiments to iden - tify the phosphorylation sites on IRTKS induced by active Src .

Identiﬁcation of Src - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation sites on IRTKS A group of IRTKS mutants containing single or double tyrosine - to - phenylalanine mutations in the I - BAR domain were co - transfec - ted with Src 530F into U2OS cells . The phosphorylation levels of each mutantwere semi - quantiﬁed by densitometric analysis ( Fig . 4A and Fig . S4 ) . Five individual mutations ( Y16F , Y37F , Y114F , Y156F and Y163F ) decreased the levels of IRTKS phosphorylation ( Fig . 3A ) , implying that these ﬁve tyrosine residues were involved in the Src - induced phosphorylation of IRTKS . Consistent with this obser - vation , a mutant ( D1M5 ) containing the IRTKS - D1 truncation and mutations in these ﬁve tyrosine residues was not phosphorylated by active Src ( Fig . 4B , lane 12 ) . To deﬁne Src - induced phosphoryla - tionof the individualtyrosineresidues inthe I - BARdomain , we gen - erated single point recovery mutants of D1M5 ( 16R , 37R , 114R , 156R and 163R ) by re - substituting phenylalanine with tyrosine . Using these recovery mutants , we found that Y37 , Y156 and Y163 were Src - induced tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the I - BAR do - main of IRTKS ( Fig . 4B , lanes 8 , 10 and 16 ) . Notably , all of these three tyrosine residues were conserved among IRTKS and IRSp53 ( Fig . S3A ) . The same strategy was used to identify Src - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation sites of IRTKS in its C - terminal region . All ﬁve sin - gle point mutations of tyrosine residues in the C - terminal region decreased phosphorylation of the IRTKS - D5 truncation ( Fig . 4C and Fig . S5 ) . D5M5 , a mutant possessing an IRTKS - D5 truncation and mutations in these ﬁve residues , was used to generate single point recovery mutants ( 274R , 293R , 380R , 396R and 439R ) . Using these recovery mutants , Y274 , Y293 and Y439 were conﬁrmed as three more tyrosine phosphorylation sites on IRTKS ( Fig . 4D ) . Two tyrosine residues ( Y274 and Y293 ) were located in the region between the I - BAR and SH3 domains of IRTKS , while Y439 was located in the conserved WWB domain of IRTKS . ( Fig . 3A and Fig . S3A ) . In addition , Y274 of IRTKS was conserved with Y310 of IRSp53 , which had been demonstrated to be phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation ( Fig . S3A ) . Next , phosphorylation of an IRTKS mutant , M6 , in which six tyrosine residues ( Y37 , Y156 , Y164 , Y274 , Y293 and Y439 ) were replaced with phenylalanine , was detected in U2OS cells with Src 530F expression . As expected , Src - induced IRTKS phosphoryla - tion disappeared in this mutant ( Fig . 4E ) . Thus , in total , six tyrosine residues of IRTKS were identiﬁed as phospho - acceptors upon stim - ulation of active Src . 3 . 5 . IRTKS phosphorylation affects cell motility The N - terminal I - BAR domain is the most conserved region among proteins of the IRSp53 family [ 1 , 25 ] . I - BAR domain binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - enriched membranes and induces membrane protru - sions [ 4 , 5 , 26 ] . The I - BAR domains of IRSp53 and MIM form a zep - pelin - shaped dimer and induce membrane evagination [ 3 , 10 , 27 ] . Each end of the dimeric I - BAR domain consists of relatively large positively charged regions which are responsible for its binding to the cell membrane [ 3 , 10 ] . The basic amino acids of this region are conserved among IRSp53 and IRTKS ( Fig . S2A ) . Interestingly , Y156 and Y163 are also located at the end of IRTKS I - BAR domain , close to these conserved basic residues ( Fig . S3B ) . Phosphorylation of Y156 and Y163 of IRTKS may regulate the binding of I - BAR do - main to cells membrane and I - BAR domain induced membrane protrusion . In addition , previous studies indicated that the serine / threonine phosphorylations in the C - terminal region of IRSp53 affect the association of IRSp53 with its binding proteins , and regulate IRSp53 - mediated ﬁlopodium formation and cell – extracellular matrix signaling [ 16 , 17 ] . Therefore , phosphor - tyro - sine in the IRTKS C - terminal region may also affect its protein interactions and further regulate its function in cell motility . To assess the effect of Src - stimulated IRTKS phosphorylation in IRTKS - promoted cell migration , HT1080 cells were transiently transfected with IRTKS , M6 or control plasmid , and used to perform wound healing assays ( Fig . 5A ) . While the wound healing rates of cells with IRTKS overexpression increased markedly in comparison with control cells , the IRTKS - M6 mutant did not show signiﬁcantly enhanced cell migration ( Fig . 5B ) .

Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRTKS is essential for IRTKS - enhanced cell motility . HT1080 cells were transiently transfected with control plasmid , IRTKS and M6 . ( A ) The cells were wounded at 24 h after transfection . Images were acquired at 0 and 24 h after wounding . The expression of IRTKS and IRTKS - M6 at the wound closure site were shown in Fig . S7 .

Chen et al . / FEBS Letters 585 ( 2011 ) 2972 – 2978 2977 analysis also showed that wild - type IRTKS was highly phosphory - lated in HT1080 cells , whereas no phosphorylation could be de - tected in the IRTKS - M6 mutant ( Fig . 5C ) . These data suggested that Src - stimulated IRTKS phosphorylation was essential for the IRTKS - induced increase in cell mobility . In summary , our results revealed that IRTKS is a substrate of Src and promotes Src - dependent cell migration . Six tyrosine residues of IRTKS , located in its functional domain for membrane interac - tion ( Y37 , Y156 , Y163 in I - BAR domain ) and potentially involved in regulating protein associations ( Y439 in WWB and Y274 , Y293 in the region between I - BAR and SH3 domain ) , were identiﬁed as Src - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation sites . We also provide data that phosphorylation of IRTKS may contribute to cell motility . The function of Src - stimulated IRTKS phosphorylation therefore merits further investigation .
