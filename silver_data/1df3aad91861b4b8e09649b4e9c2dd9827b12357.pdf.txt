Within the DIS and HCI community , the term has multiple mean - ings : In sustainable HCI , it frequently refers to ecologically sus - tainable lifestyles through the design of interactive systems and to sustainability in HCI practice itself . Conversely , community - based HCI speaks of the sustainability of HCI , referring to the longevity of our socio - technical interventions . This workshop seeks to bring together these seemingly diferent conceptions of sustainability to explore their commonalities . Arguably , longevity is important for sustainable HCI , as is ecological impact for community - based HCI . We invite participants from diverse felds , such as sustainable HCI , HCI4D , Community - Based Participatory Design , and Digital Civics to refect on past and current work , develop best practice recom - mendations , and design sustainability roadmaps to help researchers and designers to conceive , run , and evaluate future projects with sustainability through , in , and of HCI in mind .

However , the term itself remains contested , with multiple defnitions used within DIS and HCI . This workshop seeks to bring into conversation two commu - nities who use “sustainability” in diferent ways . First , sustainable HCI , which is foremost concerned with how HCI can contribute to sustainable developments ( e . g . , reduction in carbon emissions ) through the design of interactive systems , and how interactive sys - tems themselves can be more sustainable , for example by using less energy or producing less e - waste ( sustainability in HCI ) [ 2 , 12 , 27 ] . The second group is more frmly rooted in community - based HCI , where researchers have been grappling with the sustainability of socio - technical innovations , infrastructures , skills , and practices . A core concern is to explore how HCI interventions can be main - tained long - term , particularly once the research project has ended [ 4 , 10 , 11 , 18 ] . While early sustainable HCI research tended to understand sus - tainability narrowly as an environmental issue , later work has increasingly broadened our understanding of sustainability and included social and — to a lesser extent — economic aspects , slowly adopting the now common Triple Bottom Line ( TBL ) model of sustainability [ 27 ] . As part of this opening , the sustainable HCI research agenda has seen several shifts : • From prescriptive ( solutionist , behaviour change ) to specu - lative work [ 3 , 28 ] • From changing individuals to supporting activists and com - munities [ 19 ] as well policy - makers [ 2 ] • From simplistic solutions to system thinking , connecting sustainability with other concepts , such democracy [ 22 ] and social justice [ 9 ] • From human - centred perspective to non - anthropocentric thinking , fattening the social and environmental domains of the TBL [ 14 , 20 ] 127 DIS Companion ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Prost et al . • From an implicit acceptance of a capitalist economy as an unquestioned fact to understanding it as a design space [ 7 , 27 ] , opening opportunities to design for diverse economics [ 6 , 23 ] • From assuming positive impact to a difcult search for new sustainability metrics [ 25 , 26 ] and for responsible innovation [ 1 ] However , recognising the limits of computing and academic re - search to efect societal transformation as well as the urgency of the climate catastrophe , some authors have asked the HCI community to refocus their eforts on climate change over other sustainability topics [ 2 , 17 ] . In parallel , community - based PD [ 15 , 21 ] and socially engaged HCI research , such as Digital Civics [ 10 , 11 ] , have grappled with the phenomenon that interactive systems designed for and with communities can remain short - lived . Sustainability in this context usually means that interventions or innovations are maintained , scaled , replicated , or evolving [ 15 ] . However , once researchers re - treat ( e . g . , at the end of a project ) , there are many cases of ‘users’ stopping to engage , knowledge getting lost , or technology breaking [ 29 ] . The research agenda of sustainability of HCI is thus concerned with : • Recognising the importance of building and maintaining relationships with and among stakeholders [ 5 ] • Sharing control over the entire research process ( incl . project conception , data analysis and results dissemination ) to en - sure an intervention actually addresses an issue of concern ( which is not defned by researchers ) [ 4 ] • Research approaches and methods that value community knowledge and are sensitive to historic design injustices [ 4 , 13 ] • Iterating and adapting responses to evolving needs , while recognising the burden this puts on community partners [ 8 , 10 ] • Training and capacity building among community partners as a core part of design [ 4 ] • Use of accessible materials and tools and low - barrier and open - source technology [ 10 , 29 ] • Continuous funding and income generation [ 10 ] • New metrics that measure above goals [ 4 ] The two conceptions of sustainability outlined above may appear quite diferent at frst . However , both ultimately ask : How can the interactive systems we design be socially relevant in the long term ? And further : How can we know they are relevant , i . e . , how can we measure impact over time ? We therefore believe that there is much that sustainability through and in HCI and sustainability of HCI can learn from each other . If we want to contribute to sustainability through HCI , the sustainability of an HCI intervention itself is important in order to have long - term and wide - spread impact . An eco - feedback app is worth little if there is no - one to use , maintain , or update it . And in turn , if we want to increase the sustainability of HCI , drawing on sustainable HCI to consider its environmental and social impact is essential . To facilitate a conversation between these two communities , in this workshop we will explore what we mean when we say “sustainability” . Drawing on existing frameworks of sustainability , such as the Triple Bottom Line [ 27 ] , Circles of Sustainability [ 16 ] , Doughnut Economics [ 24 ] , or the UN Sustainable Development Goals [ 30 ] . We will interrogate how these frameworks translate into HCI practice , spanning ecological , social , economic , political , and cultural dimensions of sustainability . We will use the various dimensions and specifc emphases of these frameworks as guiding questions and prompts to refect on the sustainability of our own work , collect challenges and opportunities for sustainability , and develop refective roadmaps to assist HCI researchers asking holistic yet specifc questions as they conceive , run , and evaluate their research . 2 WORKSHOP THEMES The workshop invites researchers and practitioners from diverse felds in DIS , HCI and PD who are interested in and have worked on questions on sustainability ( in any meaning of the term ) . Specifcally , we are interested in exploring the following themes : 2 . 1 Sustainability Frameworks We invite participants to refect on diverse sustainability concep - tions and frameworks and how they are applied within HCI , PD , and HCI4D , including Triple Bottom Line , Circles of Sustainability , Doughnut Economics , the UN Sustainable Development Goals , or specifc philosophies , such as permaculture . We welcome discus - sions on tensions between broad and narrow defnitions of sustain - ability and how they shape research agendas and the development of specifc IT interventions or solutions , including environmen - tal , ecological , social , economic , technological , political , cultural , spiritual , and emotional dimensions . Furthermore , we are inter - ested in concepts intersecting sustainability debates , including the more - than - human , diverse economies , democracy , social justice , resilience , and responsible innovation . 2 . 2 Participation , Power , and Knowledge Understanding sustainability as an interdisciplinary and collabora - tive efort within and beyond HCI , we are interested in the complex - ities that emerge out of this work . What is the role of equity and how is power shared between researchers and participants during research conception , design processes , governance , data collection , analysis , communication , and research translation ? We understand participants and users not just as consumers , but also as produc - ers , businesses , communities , activists , and policy makers . How are community , indigenous , and traditional knowledge systems recognised in the design process ? What is the role of consensus ( prescription ) versus contestation ( speculation ) in sustainability eforts ? 2 . 3 Longevity , Learning , and Impact Long - term use , iteration , adaptation , and impact of socio - technical systems is essential for their sustainability . How are these systems maintained , scaled , replicated , and how do they evolve ? There is a tension between training and capacity building for communities and continuous research involvement through infrastructuring . What sustainable funding or income sources make socio - technical systems fnancially viable ? Questioning longevity , we also invite 128 Bringing Sustainability through , in , and of HCI into Conversation DIS Companion ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA discussions of valuable dissolutions , ends , and transformations of research into something else . Finally , how do we measure impact and what are the limits of metrics ? 3 WORKSHOP GOALS AND ACTIVITIES In this 1 - day hybrid workshop , we hope to bring together a diverse group of researchers and practitioners to move forward debates on sustainability . Specifcally , the workshop will provide the opportu - nity to : • Refect on participants’ own experiences with “sustainability” in their work • Discuss diferent conceptions and frameworks of sustainabil - ity developed and used within and outside of HCI • Relate discourses on sustainability of HCI research with sustainability through and in HCI research • Gather best practice recommendations to improve the sus - tainability of HCI projects ( understood in holistic and diverse ways ) • Develop a sustainability ‘roadmap’ as a refective tool for HCI researchers ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was funded by UKRI EPSRC as part of the Centre for Digital Citizens ( EP / T022582 / 1 ) .
