RES EAR CH A RT I C LE Open Access The predictors of 3 - and 30 - day mortality in 660 MERS - CoV patients Anwar E . Ahmed Abstract Background : The mortality rate of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) patients is a major challenge in all healthcare systems worldwide . Because the MERS - CoV risk - standardized mortality rates are currently unavailable in the literature , the author concentrated on developing a method to estimate the risk - standardized mortality rates using MERS - CoV 3 - and 30 - day mortality measures . Methods : MERS - CoV data in Saudi Arabia is publicly reported and made available through the Saudi Ministry of Health ( SMOH ) website . The author studied 660 MERS - CoV patients who were reported by the SMOH between December 2 , 2014 and November 12 , 2016 . The data gathered contained basic demographic information ( age , gender , and nationality ) , healthcare worker , source of infection , pre - existing illness , symptomatic , severity of illness , and regions in Saudi Arabia . The status and date of mortality were also reported . Cox - proportional hazard ( CPH ) models were applied to estimate the hazard ratios for the predictors of 3 - and 30 - day mortality . Results : 3 - day , 30 - day , and overall mortality were found to be 13 . 8 % , 28 . 3 % , and 29 . 8 % , respectively . According to CPH , multivariate predictors of 3 - day mortality were elderly , non - healthcare workers , illness severity , and hospital - acquired infections ( adjusted hazard ratio ( aHR ) = 1 . 7 ; 8 . 8 ; 6 . 5 ; and 2 . 8 , respectively ) . Multivariate predictors of 30 - day mortality were elderly , non - healthcare workers , pre - existing illness , severity of illness , and hospital - acquired infections ( aHR = 1 . 7 ; 19 . 2 ; 2 . 1 ; 3 . 7 ; and 2 . 9 , respectively ) . Conclusions : Several factors were identified that could influence mortality outcomes at 3 days and 30 days , including age ( elderly ) , non - healthcare workers , severity of illness , and hospital - acquired infections . The findings can serve as a guide for healthcare practitioners by appropriately identifying and managing potential patients at high risk of death . Keywords : Mortality , MERS - CoV , Elderly , Camels , Saudi Arabia Background In September of 2012 [ 1 ] , the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) was initially identi - fied in humans in a 60 - year - old Saudi male . Since then , outbreaks of MERS - CoV have been noted in Saudi Arabia . Although the number of new cases has dropped tremendously , to date the Saudi Ministry of Health continues to receive cases . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) routinely receives these cases in situational reports , and on June 23 , 2016 , WHO warranted reviewing unusual patterns , continued surveillance , and applying control measures [ 2 ] . The clinical and the epidemiological out - comes of MERS - CoV have been major public health concerns and a burden on the healthcare systems , and have become a top priority in Saudi Arabia [ 3 ] . It has been re - ported that Saudi Arabia has the largest MERS population throughout the world , followed by the Republic of Korea and the United Arab Emirates [ 2 ] . Saudi Arabia hosts Hajj every year , and it is a potential zone for rapid respiratory infection , particularly MERS - CoV re - emergence , since more than 2 million pilgrims arrive annually in Makkah to conduct Hajj for a period of 5 days . As of November 17 , 2016 , and according to WHO , since its emergence in Saudi Arabia , 1826 laboratory - confirmed MERS - CoV cases have been identified worldwide , resulting in a total of 649 deaths related to MERS - CoV [ 2 ] . This results in an overall MERS - CoV mortality rate of 35 . 5 % in worldwide cases . According to the Saudi Ministry of Health , between 2012 and November 14 , 2016 , a total of 1480 confirmed Correspondence : ahmeda5 @ vcu . edu Associate Professor , College of Public Health and Health Informatics , King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia © The Author ( s ) . 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4 . 0 International License ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by / 4 . 0 / ) , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided you give appropriate credit to the original author ( s ) and the source , provide a link to the Creative Commons license , and indicate if changes were made .

Ahmed BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2017 ) 17 : 615 DOI 10 . 1186 / s12879 - 017 - 2712 - 2 MERS - CoV cases have been reported publicly : 616 deaths , 855 cases recovered , and 9 cases under treat - ment . This results in an overall mortality rate of 41 % on reported cases in Saudi Arabia . However , a number of other studies in Saudi Arabia have reported MERS - CoV with widely varying mortality rates . Assiri reported a 60 % mortality rate on a sample 47 cases [ 4 ] , while an - other study reported a mortality rate of 42 % [ 5 ] . Two other studies reported a mortality rate of 40 % [ 6 , 7 ] , and Coleman reported a mortality rate of 38 % [ 8 ] . The reported mortality rates in Saudi Arabia tend to be higher than in other countries [ 9 ] . A study in Jordan reported a mortality rate of 22 % in MERS cases [ 10 ] , while two studies in South Korea reported 19 % [ 11 ] and 20 . 4 % [ 12 ] mortality rates in MERS cases . Several studies reported that elderly patients [ 13 – 19 ] , patients with comorbidities [ 14 , 18 , 19 ] , and men [ 19 , 20 ] are at high risk of death and of developing MERS - CoV complications . However , other studies noted that the frequency of deaths was less in men [ 21 ] and in healthcare workers [ 13 , 18 , 20 , 21 ] . Little data has been collected on risk - standardized mortality rates and multi - variate risk factors of 3 - and 30 - day mortality in the MERS - CoV population . Per the author knowledge , a single study used Poisson regression to identify risk fac - tors for overall mortality and severe MERS - CoV disease [ 18 ] . The current study established MERS - CoV mortality measures at 3 days and 30 days . The study aimed to de - termine the 3 - and 30 - day survival rates and their risk factors on a large MERS - CoV population in Saudi Arabia . Methods Data sources The Saudi Ministry of Health receives new confirmed cases from hospitals across the kingdom . The Saudi Ministry of Health provides daily situational reports on new confirmed cases and provides a routine update on developments to the community and the media through the Command and Control Center ( CCC ) hotline and the website . Since its emergence , the MERS - CoV data was made publicly available on the Saudi Ministry of Health website directory at http : / / www . moh . gov . sa / en / ccc / pressreleases / pages / default . aspx . As the study data are publicly available online , it does not require Institu - tional Review Board ( IRB ) oversight and approval . The author analyzed publicly available national - level data on MERS - CoV cases and deaths that were reported from December 2 , 2014 until November 12 , 2016 by the Saudi Ministry of Health . The author used data from this period because a standard data collection was used dur - ing this time to obtain relevant demographic , clinical , and epidemiological information from each MERS - CoV patient . The data has been extracted by the study author and reviewed and entered by a research assistant . Data quality has been verified and assessed by both the author and the research assistant . The available data is anonym - ous , with no patient identifiers , and provides informa - tion on age , gender , Saudi nationality ( Yes / No ) , whether healthcare worker ( Yes / No ) , pre - existing illness ( Yes / No ) , severity of illness ( Yes / No ) , and death ( Yes / No ) . The reported severity of illness of these patients may not reflect the up - to - date final medical condition status . The ages of patients were classified into two groups : elderly ≥ 60 years and < 60 years old . MERS - CoV source of infections was investigated and reported as camels , household contact , hospital - acquired infection , and unknown infection source . MERS - CoV data was re - ported by Saudi cities , and the author divided them into five major regions ( Central , East , South , West , and North ) . Primary end points The study outcome was whether a patient died , and the date of the reported death . The overall mortality was defined as the percentage of patients who had died during the 45 days following the MERS - CoV diagnosis . The main outcome measures used were 3 - and 30 - day survival rates from the initial reported time of the MERS - CoV diagnosis to the reported death . However , the deaths were announced on the SMOH website with - out reporting the causes . Between December 2 , 2014 and November 12 , 2016 , a total of 660 confirmed cases were reported by the Saudi Ministry of Health and have been included in this study . Statistical analysis SAS version 9 . 4 ( SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC , USA ) was used to conduct the analyses . A summary of sample characteristics was reported in Table 1 . Bivariate analyses : Chi - Square / Fisher ’ s exact tests were used to compare risks of overall mortality in MERS - CoV pa - tients across the sample characteristics ( Table 2 ) . Cox - - proportional hazard ( CPH ) models were applied to estimate the unadjusted hazard ratios for the predictors of 3 - and 30 - day mortality ( Table 3 ) . Multivariate analyses : Cox - proportional hazard ( CPH ) models were applied to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios for the predictors of 3 - and 30 - day mortality ( Table 2 ) . Included in the multivariate analyses were the following variables : age , gender , nationality , whether healthcare worker , pre - existing illness , severity of illness , and MERS - CoV source of infection . Furthermore , time to death was ana - lyzed in terms of 3 days and 30 days by the Kaplan - Meier method ( Figs . 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) . The hypothesis test was two - tailed , with a p ≤ 0 . 05 indicative of statistical significance . Ahmed BMC Infectious Diseases ( 2017 ) 17 : 615 Page 2 of 8 Results A total of 660 MERS - CoV infections in confirmed cases was reported by the Saudi Ministry of Health between December 2 , 2014 and November 12 , 2016 . Of these , 39 . 2 % were elderly ( aged ≥ 60 years ) . The sample was relatively old , with a mean age of 53 . 9 ( ±SD 17 . 9 ) and with ages ranging between 2 and 109 years . More than two - thirds ( 68 . 6 % ) of the sample were males , 15 . 9 % were healthcare workers , 68 . 6 % had pre - existing illnesses , and 41 . 9 % had severe illness conditions . Camel exposure was found in 41 . 6 % of the cases . The majority ( 64 . 4 % ) of the cases were reported in the Central region of Saudi Arabia . Refer to Table 1 for the sample characteristics . The subgroup analyses are shown in Table 2 . Of the cases studied , 197 died with an overall mortality rate of 29 . 8 % and a 95 % confidence interval between 21 . 77 % – 28 . 53 % . No significant difference in the overall mortality rate was noted between males and females ( 31 . 2 % vs . 27 . 1 % ; p = 0 . 281 ) . However , there was a significantly higher mortality rate in elderly patients ( ≥ 60 years ) compared with patients aged < 60 years ( 45 . 2 % vs . 20 . 0 % ; p = 0 . 001 ) . A higher mortality rate was found in those of the Saudi nationality ( 35 . 8 % vs . 15 . 5 % non - Saudi nation - ality ; p = 0 . 001 ) , those with preexisting illness ( 60 . 6 % vs . 15 . 7 % non - preexisting illness ; p = 0 . 001 ) , and the severity of illness ( 50 . 0 % vs . 14 . 9 % stable condition ; p = 0 . 001 ) . It was found that healthcare workers had a significantly lower mortality rate ( 1 % vs . 29 . 6 % non - healthcare workers ; p = 0 . 001 ) . A high risk of mortality was noted in patients with unknown ( 39 . 5 % ) sources of infections as compared to 4 . 5 % household contact , 25 . 2 % camels , 27 . 4 % healthcare acquired ; p = 0 . 001 . The West / North region reported the lowest mortality rate ( 22 . 1 % ) as compared to 29 . 2 % South , 31 . 7 % East , 31 . 1 % Central ; p = 0 . 026 . The multivariate risk factors are shown in Table 2 . Dur - ing the 3 days of follow - up , 91 ( 13 . 8 % ) MERS - CoV pa - tients died . Cox proportional hazard multivariate analysis identified several independent predictors of 3 - day mortal - ity in MERS - CoV patients . Elderly , non - healthcare worker , severity of illness , and hospital - acquired infections ( adjusted hazard ratio [ aHR ] : 1 . 7 ; 8 . 8 ; 6 . 5 ; and 2 . 8 , respect - ively ) . During the 30 days of follow - up , 187 ( 28 . 3 % ) MERS - CoV patients died . The 30 - day mortality rate was higher in the elderly , non - healthcare worker , severity of illness , pre - existing illness , and hospital - acquired infec - tions ( aHR : 1 . 7 ; 19 . 2 ; 2 . 1 ; 3 . 7 , and 2 . 9 , respectively ) . The Kaplan – Meier method ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) shows the 3 - day ( 79 . 15 % vs . 90 . 77 % ) and 30 - day ( 57 . 92 % vs . 80 . 55 % ) survival rates in the elderly group as compared to those of the under age 60 group . The 3 - day ( 83 . 96 % vs . 98 . 10 % ) and 30 - day ( 66 . 67 % vs . 98 . 10 % ) survival rates were in the non - healthcare worker group as compared to the health - care worker group ( Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Discussion The study results are based on 660 confirmed MERS - CoV infection cases extracted from public situational re - ports available on the Saudi Ministry of Health website . The study included cases from Saudi Arabia , and as of 27 February 2017 , there have been reports of sporadic cases by the Saudi Ministry of Health . This data was also publicly available through the WHO website along with other MERS - CoV new case situational reports from other countries . Although the overall mortality rate ( 29 . 8 % ) in this study slightly decreased from what had been reported in Saudi Arabia , 60 % [ 4 ] , 42 % [ 5 ] , 40 % [ 6 , 7 ] , 38 % [ 8 ] , with approximately one death in three of those infected with the MERS - CoV virus , it is still troubling and remains high when compared to South Korea [ 11 , 12 ] . The recent declining in MERS - CoV mortality in Saudi Arabia could be due to implementation of prevention and control policies and placing great at - tention on MERS - CoV management in order to im - prove patient clinical outcomes . It was noted that there was a decline in the incidence of MERS - CoV infection reported over the past 2 years . A prior study has indicated that cases occurring later in the MERS - CoV emergence were less of a serious threat [ 18 ] .

The study investigated 3 - and 30 - day survival rates and their risk factors . The 3 - and 30 - day survival rates in MERS - CoV patients were found to be 86 . 2 % and 71 . 7 % , respectively . Mortality occurs more often in elderly patients ( 45 . 2 % ) than in those under age 60 ( 20 . 0 % ) . Being elderly was associated with a 1 . 7 times higher risk of 3 - and 30 - day mortality as compared with those under age 60 . The hazard of death in the elderly with MERS - CoV infec - tions was 70 % higher than with those under age 60 . This evidence is consistent with most of previous studies , supporting the fact that older age is associated with in - creased risk of mortality in MERS - CoV patients [ 13 – 19 ] . Since it is not clear whether MERS - CoV related - death can be prevented among elderly patients , medical inves - tigation and screening are warranted in elderly MERS - CoV patients to identify the reasons behind the high risk of death . The study findings suggest that there was no statistically significant difference in the 3 - and 30 - day survival between males and females , unlike other studies that suggest males have a higher risk of death [ 19 , 20 ] , while another study contradicts these two studies ’ find - ings and suggest that males have a low risk of death [ 21 ] . Gender influence on 3 - and 30 - day survival is war - ranted , especially in the older age group . A pre - existing illness was found to have an important effect on the risks of 30 - day mortality in MERS - CoV patients ( Figs . 3 ) . The hazard of 30 - day mortality in MERS - CoV patients with pre - existing illnesses is two times higher than in MERS - CoV patients without pre - existing illnesses . The 30 - day survival rates were found to be 42 . 91 % in MERS - CoV patients with pre - existing illness compared to 82 . 76 % in MERS - CoV patients with - out pre - existing illness . Several studies confirmed , in agreement with the current study findings , an increased risk of death in patients with underlying comorbidity [ 14 , 18 , 19 ] . When necessary , a routine check - up and treatment of MERS - CoV patients with underlying comorbidity may be effective for MERS - CoV infection recovery and prevention of 30 - day mortality . MERS - CoV patients with severe illness conditions had a higher risk of 3 - and 30 - day mortality compared to patients without severe illness conditions ( Fig . 3 and 4 ) , which is also reflected in lower survival probability ( 72 . 46 % vs . 96 . 60 % ) and ( 51 . 45 % vs . 86 . 65 % ) , respect - ively .

This is consistent with several previous studies [ 13 , 18 , 20 , 21 ] . The low risk of death among the healthcare worker group could be due to timely and early diagnosis of MERS - CoV infection and the level of control and practices [ 22 ] . However , a large epidemiological study is needed to evaluate the high risk of death among the non - healthcare worker group . In such a study , modifiable factors could be assessed . For example , those can be addressed by the health system , such as access to healthcare , or by educa - tional programs such as raising the level of awareness on proper management of infection and prevention practices . The author noted several limitations . The study data was based on Saudi Ministry of Health situational re - ports which are publicly available sources and not dir - ectly aggregated from patients ’ medical records or follow - ups . The date from symptoms onset was not re - ported publicly by the Saudi Ministry of Health , thus the time of the MERS - CoV diagnosis to outcome was used , rather than the date of symptom onset . Not all patients experience MERS symptoms , while other patients may experience mild or severe respiratory illness , thus the survival rate may differ if the date of symptom onset was used . A delay in the MERS diagnosis could worsen patient outcome and increase the risk of death . The pa - tient outcomes ( died / alive ) and new cases are updated daily by the Saudi Ministry of Health . Thus , the patient outcomes may not represent the final outcomes . The new cases , time of diagnosis , death status , and date of death were recorded at the time of reporting . However , the current analyses were based on the report as of November 12 , 2016 , where the data has been accessed by the study author . As this data is gathered from public sources , there is no information on cause of death or details on underlying conditions . Not having the specific underlying conditions at hand , the current study find - ings suggest that this type of association might become a prerequisite for interventional studies . There is no infor - mation regarding patients ’ occupations , however it may be that there are possible links between occupation and MERS - CoV infection . Nonetheless , the current study evaluated MERS - CoV outcomes , such as 3 - and 30 - day mortality and their risk factors .

This study could be of value to policymakers and healthcare sys - tems worldwide in identifying patients with high risk of death and shorter survival . The study revealed several prognostic factors that might explain the high rates of early mortality . It looks promising ( in both bivariate and multivariate analyses ) that having such information was associated with 3 - and 30 - day mortality . The results of this study may be useful to healthcare professionals who are providing medical care for MERS patients by appro - priately identifying and managing potential patients at high risk of death . Conclusion Several factors were identified that could influence mor - tality outcome at 3 days and 30 days , including being elderly , being a non - healthcare worker , along with illness severity and hospital - acquired infections . The findings can serve as a guide for healthcare practitioners when monitoring and managing the virus , especially at the early stages . Implementing outcome measures and strat - egies to improve patients ’ survival in MERS - CoV pa - tients should be an ultimate goal for public health policymakers .
