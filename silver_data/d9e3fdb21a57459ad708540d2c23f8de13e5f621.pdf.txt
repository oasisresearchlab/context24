Models of individual cells were constructed using the particles which cover the surfaces 11 of cell walls and are interconnected in a triangle mesh network by viscoelastic springs . The 12 spatial arrangement of the cells required to construct a virtual tissue was obtained using 13 Poisson - disc sampling and Voronoi tessellation in 3D space . Three structural features were 14 included in the model : viscoelastic material of cell walls , linearly elastic interior of the cells 15 ( simulating compressible liquid ) and a gas phase in the intercellular spaces . The response of 16 the models to an external load was demonstrated during quasi - static compression simulations . 17 The sensitivity of the model was investigated at fixed compression parameters with variable 18 tissue porosity , cell size and cell wall properties , such as thickness and Young’s modulus , and 19 a stiffness of the cell interior that simulated turgor pressure . The extent of the agreement 20 between the simulation results and other models published is discussed . 21 The model demonstrated the significant influence of tissue structure on 22 micromechanical properties and allowed for the interpretation of the compression test results 23 with respect to changes occurring in the structure of the virtual tissue . During compression 24 virtual structures composed of smaller cells produced higher reaction forces and therefore 25 they were stiffer than structures with large cells . The increase in the number of intercellular 26 spaces ( porosity ) resulted in a decrease in reaction forces . The numerical model was capable of 27 simulating the quasi - static compression experiment and reproducing the strain stiffening observed in 28 experiment . Stress accumulation at the edges of the cell walls where three cells meet suggests 29 that cell - to - cell debonding and crack propagation through the contact edge of neighboring 30 cells is one of the most prevalent ways for tissue to rupture . 31 32 1 . Introduction 33 Computational simulation at the macroscale has proven to be a valuable tool for 34 predicting the nutritional value , sensory attributes and safety of foods , as well as optimizing 35 food production processes and storage conditions by minimizing trial - and - error experimental 36 procedures ( Nemènyi et al . , 2000 , Hernández et al . , 2006 , Lewis et al . , 2007 , Nguyen et al . , 37 2007 , Sadrina et al . , 2008 , Dintwa et al . , 2008 ) . Further developments in numerical methods 38 along with an increase in computing power have resulted in several cell - based models of plant 39 tissues which can be found in the literature . In such applications , plant cells are often 40 described as a thin walled vessel for incompressible fluid . Through aggregation and 41 connectivity via pectin middle lamellae , cells form large macroscopic structures – tissues . 42 Although such a simulation is a crude approximation of a complex dynamic and multiscale 43 system such as plant tissue , it serves well as a foundation for numerical models . Along with 44 an increasing level of knowledge about the complex hierarchical microstructures of plant 45 tissue , a multiscale approach has become the key to understanding the resulting constitutive 46 Page 1 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

View Article Online DOI : 10 . 1039 / C7SM01137G relations that produce mechanical behavior at macroscopic scales or to simulating processes 47 important to industry ( Verboven et al . , 2008 ) . The multiscale approach involves building a 48 hierarchy of sub - models , which describe mechanical behavior at different spatial scales . 49 However , due to the increasing morphological complexity within a decreasing scale of 50 simulation , difficulties in building a suitable model increase rapidly . 51 One of the first applications of FEM in modeling plant micromechanics was aimed at 52 an analysis of the response of a single cell under uniaxial compressive loading ( Pitt and 53 Davis , 1984 , Wu and Pitts , 1998 ) . Further development of single - cell models allowed for the 54 consideration of large deformations , cell wall permeability and non - linear constitutive 55 relationships in cell wall material ( Wang et al . , 2004 , 2006 , Dintwa et al . , 2011 ) . A more 56 complex model of the whole tissue was demonstrated by Loodts et al . ( 2006 ) , who developed 57 a 2D model of onion epidermis derived from a discrete element approach . Ho et al . ( 2009 , 58 2010 , 2011 ) presented a microscale model of gas - exchange that featured virtual tissue 59 geometry based on the actual 3 - D microstructure of the tissue , however deformation and 60 mechanical loads were not included in this solution . Pieczywek et al . ( 2014 ) incorporated a 61 real microstructure in an FEM model of onion epidermis , which resulted in a qualitative 62 improvement of the mechanical characteristics . The models demonstrated the capability of 63 simulating large strains ( up to 25 % ) with nonlinear behavior and produced force - strain curves 64 that closely matched the experimental data . The ability to directly simulate the impact of 65 changes in turgor pressure was limited due to the semi - three - dimensional representation of 66 tissue . 67 Recently , particle - based models have produced interest among researchers from the 68 agriculture and food processing field . The particle based methods , originally developed for 69 geomechanics and granular matter problems , have found widespread applications in 70 simulations of bulk materials ( Baudet et al . , 2009 , Lin et al . , 2014 ) and thin membranes ( Van 71 Gelder , 1998 , Mesit et al . , 2007 , Liu et al . , 2012 ) , agriculture and food handling ( Harrison 72 and Cleary , 2012 ) , biomedical simulations ( Hammer et al . , 2011 ) and the entertainment 73 industry ( Liu et al . , 2013 , Stomakhin et al . , 2013 ) . In the field of plant tissue micromechanics 74 and its relationship with structure and properties , several numerical implementations of 75 particle methodology have already been published . Lindekerke et al . ( 2010 , 2011 ) developed 76 particle - based models to investigate the formation of bruises and other damage to tissue under 77 excessive loading . Models of parenchyma type cells included two material domains : liquid - 78 like cell interiors and viscoelastic - plastic solid cell walls . Both the three - dimensional single 79 cell model and the two - dimensional model of cell aggregates were based on similar principles 80 – the cell fluid was modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ( SPH ) technique , while 81 for the cell wall the discrete element model was applied . Models also included mechanical 82 failure either in the form of cell wall rupture or debonding of the middle lamella . The 83 proposed approach demonstrated a high degree of flexibility and was capable of reproducing 84 the experimental data of quasi - static compression . Fozard et al . ( 2013 ) developed a vertex - 85 element model which resolved individual cells and included the anisotropic non - linear 86 viscoelastic mechanical properties of cell walls and cell division . The model was applied in 87 studies of the role of mechanical properties and cellulose microfibril orientation in the 88 macroscale growth of plant root using 2D geometries . The framework developed included 89 simple mechanisms for the simulation of cell division demonstrating the capabilities of this 90 approach to computation . The particle - based approach was also successfully applied in the 91 simulation of plant cell shrinkage during drying ( Karunasena et al . , 2014a , 2014b ) . Similar to 92 Lindekerke et al . ( 2010 , 2011 ) , the model was based on coupled mesh - free techniques – SPH 93 and DEM . Hexagonal plant cells were aggregated in tissues that had the characteristics of 94 middle lamellae . However , the cell wall particle interaction model was more capable of 95 Page 2 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

In 103 contrast to the SPH technique , the MSS approach is characterized by the fixed topology of 104 particle connections approximating the mechanical properties of continuous material . This 105 approach is frequently used to simulate deformable objects due to its conceptual simplicity 106 and computational speed . The model presented in this paper was developed to simulate the 107 mechanical behavior of isotropic parenchyma tissue under external load conditions in three - 108 dimensional space . The proposed numerical formulations describe the multiphase structure of 109 the tissue in microscopic detail . Three important structural features were included : 110 viscoelastic material of cell walls , linearly elastic interior of the cells ( simulating 111 compressible liquid ) and a gas phase in the intercellular spaces . The solution presented here 112 may be considered as a coarse - grained approach in terms of the representation of the shape of 113 the cell . Less detailed discretization was a trade - off that saved computational resources for a 114 full three - dimensional realistic representation of plant tissues . To the best of our knowledge 115 this is the first 3D model describing the micromechanics of bulk plant tissue under external 116 load conditions at a subcellular level . 117 In the following sections of this paper we present a detailed description of the model 118 development . Firstly , we describe the algorithm of plant tissue structure generation in 3D 119 space . Next , we describe the basic data structures underlying the practical implementation of 120 the model . Then , the principles of numerical formulation are described – these are the 121 governing equations of tissue mechanics . Section 3 describes and discusses the results of 122 quasi - static compression simulations and model sensitivity analysis . The goal of this study 123 was to provide a flexible and robust framework capable of large - scale simulations of realistic 124 3D cellular structures , such as plant tissues . 125 126 2 . Materials and methods 127 2 . 1 . Generation of a three - dimensional structure of plant tissue 128 The virtual tissue structure was generated numerically using an algorithm based on 129 Poisson - disc sampling in 3D space . Poisson - disc sampling is an algorithm that produces 130 tightly - packed , stochastically arranged patterns of points ( Ying et al . , 2014 , Guo et al . , 2015 ) . 131 The rule by which points are arranged is based on a special routine that checks if the distance 132 between the generated points satisfies fixed distance criteria , for instance , whether it is greater 133 than an arbitrarily chosen threshold radius . 134 In our implementation , the Poisson - disc sampling algorithm populated a three - 135 dimensional space with points , which in the next step were used to generate Voronoi cells . 136 The coordinates of the new points ( cell centroids ) were selected randomly from a uniform 137 distribution , but bounded to fit an arbitrarily defined rectangular space that corresponded to 138 the desired size of the virtual tissue sample . 139 Fig . 1 shows in a simplified way , the principles of the generation of cell centroids . The 140 grid was filled using the Monte Carlo approach – a number of points were created and 141 processed in order to test if they overlap already occupied cells . When the assigned threshold 142 sphere did not overlap occupied cells it was inserted into the grid space , and the status of the 143 individual grid cell was updated . This process was repeated until the termination criterion was 144 satisfied - in our implementation it was the desired number of points inserted into the grid . 145 Page 3 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

View Article Online DOI : 10 . 1039 / C7SM01137G The coordinates of the generated points were inserted into the tessellation algorithm as seed 160 points of Voronoi cells ( red dots on Fig . 1 – generation of cell centroids ) . The Voronoi 161 tessellation was performed with an open boundary assumption . An additional layer of cells 162 was created along the boundary of virtual tissue , forcing cells to have finite edges . In the final 163 model the additional layer of boundary cells was removed . In the next step intercellular pores 164 were generated . After establishing cell shapes , cell wall surfaces were discretized with a 165 triangular mesh in order to define the spring network ( Fig 1 . step 2 ) . Finally the geometry of 166 the tissue was refined by smoothing the cell wall surfaces ( Fig 1 . step 3 ) . More details of this 167 algorithm can be found in Section 5 . 1 . 168 169 2 . 2 . Basic data structures of the numerical model 170 The virtual tissue was structured using hierarchically organized , conceptual objects that 171 reflect the basic geometrical building blocks of a deformable cell wall membrane and convey 172 information on the current state of the model ( Fig . 2 ) . The most basic structure of the model 173 was the particle , which was directly included in the differential equations of motion . In our 174 version , the particle was a material point with mass , described by its position , velocity and the 175 total force acting upon it in three dimensions . Since we were using the Mass - Spring System 176 approach , the next structure in the hierarchy was a linear element formulated by the Kelvin - 177 Voight viscoelastic material model . Each linear element connecting two particles was defined 178 by its rest length , stiffness and damping coefficient . The linear elements gave the 179 mathematical definitions of interaction between neighboring particles approximating the 180 properties of a continuous membrane material . The topology of a network of linear elements 181 was established by the edges of triangular elements that discretized cell wall surfaces , as 182 mentioned in the previous section . Therefore , the next type of structure that constituted a 183 model of virtual tissue was the triangular shell element . These types of structures conveyed 184 information about which three neighboring particles and therefore three linear elements were 185 connected and formed the basic triangular section of the cell wall membrane . Each shell 186 element also had a cell index number assigned to it . Information stored in the shell elements 187 was crucial for rapid computations of the current geometrical properties of the cell . Shell 188 elements were organized into cells that were at the top of the hierarchy of our model . Three 189 properties were assigned to the cell structure - the initial volume , current internal pressure and 190 the cell interior stiffness coefficient . 191 192 193 Fig . 2 .

Independent and pair - wise particle interactions 202 In particle - based methods of simulation , such as DEM , particles interact with each other 203 and the surrounding environment through discrete forces . In this paper , we employ the DEM 204 simulation scheme where the total force f (cid:2) acting on a single i - th particle is defined as the sum 205 of independent partial forces : 206 f (cid:2) = f (cid:8) + f (cid:10) + f (cid:11) + f (cid:12) ( 1 ) 207 Fig . 2 shows a schematic representation of force interactions from equation 1 . The f (cid:8) term 208 stands for a force generated by a linear element that connects two neighboring particles and it 209 is defined as : 210 f (cid:8) = - k (cid:2)(cid:14) (cid:15) (cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20) (cid:16) (cid:21)(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) (cid:21) - 1(cid:23) x (cid:2)(cid:14) - b (cid:2)(cid:14) ( v (cid:2)(cid:14) ∙ (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) (cid:21) ) (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) (cid:21)(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) (cid:21) ( 2 ) 211 where k (cid:2)(cid:14) is the stiffness of the elastic component of the material model ( cell wall stiffness ) , 212 b (cid:2)(cid:14) is the viscous component of the material model ( cell wall damping ) , (cid:21)x (cid:2)(cid:14)(cid:31) (cid:21) is the rest length 213 of the linear element , (cid:21)x (cid:2)(cid:14) (cid:21) is the current length of the linear element and v (cid:2)(cid:14) is the relative 214 velocity between particles i and j . The force f (cid:8) was added to the j - th particle and the opposite 215 force ( - f (cid:8) ) was also added to the i - th particle . In order to provide a direct relationship between 216 spring parameters and the elastic properties of a simulated material , the stiffness of each linear 217 element was calculated using a formulation proposed by Van Gelder ( 1998 ) . In this model the 218 stiffness coefficient of a spring with rest length (cid:21)x (cid:2)(cid:14)(cid:31) (cid:21) was calculated from the geometrical 219 parameters of triangular elements that share this spring as a common edge : 220 k (cid:2)(cid:14) = ∑ % & ' ( ' (cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20) (cid:16) ) ( * + , ) - . / * + % & ' , 01 ' ) + (cid:12) ' ) - (cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20) (cid:16) ) 2 3 ( ' 4 * - , ) 5 ( 3 ) 221 where E is Young’s modulus of the cell wall , υ is the Poisson ratio of the cell wall , t . is the 222 depth of the triangle , A . is the area of the triangle , a . and b . are the lengths of the non - 223 shared edges of the triangle . The implicit integration scheme requires the calculation of the 224 partial derivatives that contribute to Jacobian matrices ∂F / ∂x and ∂F / ∂v ( where F is the 225 total particle forces matrix , please see section 5 . 2 for more details ) . For a damped oscillator 226 generating force f (cid:8) partial derivatives are defined as a 3 x 3 matrices : 227 228 J (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) = > (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) ⨂(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) ⋅(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) + 0I - (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) ⨂(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) ⋅(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) 2 (cid:15)1 - (cid:16)(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20) (cid:16) (cid:21)(cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) (cid:21) (cid:23)B k (cid:2)(cid:14) ( 4 ) 229 J C (cid:18)(cid:19) = I b (cid:2)(cid:14) ( 5 ) 230 where I is a 3 x 3 identity matrix . J (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) and J C (cid:18)(cid:19) are added to ij and ji submatrices ( outside 231 diagonal ) and subtracted from ii and jj submatrices of the Jacobian matrices ∂F / ∂x and 232 ∂F / ∂v . Since J C (cid:18)(cid:19) depends only on b (cid:2)(cid:14) , which is constant , these derivatives are calculated 233 only at the beginning of the simulation . Submatrices J (cid:17) (cid:18)(cid:19) are recalculated during each time 234 step . 235 Page 6 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

View Article Online DOI : 10 . 1039 / C7SM01137G The pressure force f (cid:10) exerted on the i - th particle was calculated as one third of the total 236 pressure force acting on all triangular elements shared by this particle : 237 f (cid:10) = * D ∑ p . A . n . . ( 6 ) 238 where , p . is the pressure acting on the triangle , A . is the area of the triangle and n . is the 239 normal vector of the triangle ( unit vector perpendicular to the surface of the triangle ) . 240 Changes in the internal pressure for each cell were modeled by means of the simple 241 proportionality rule : 242 p (cid:11) = - K H I - H I(cid:20) H I(cid:20) ( 7 ) 243 where K is the interior stiffness coefficient of the cell , V (cid:11)(cid:31) is the initial volume of the cell and 244 V (cid:11) is the current volume of the cell . Cells volumes were calculated in each time step using 245 the Green - Gauss theorem . The contact forces V (cid:11) were modeled using the standard penalty 246 method . The penalty method enforces contact by “penalizing” any penetration of two 247 neighboring surfaces . The contact forces generated were proportional to the distance of 248 penetration , and endeavor to separate the objects . This force is defined as : 249 250 f (cid:11) = - p M dm (cid:2) ( 8 ) 251 where d is the distance between particle and penetrated surface , calculated along the direction 252 of the normal vector of the surface and p M is the penalty factor . The magnitude of this force is 253 controlled by an arbitrarily chosen penalty factor . This approach requires a carefully chosen 254 value for the penalty factor as large values may cause a stability problem . Therefore , several 255 attempts might be required before obtaining the optimal value . An additional term for the 256 “global” damping force f (cid:12) was added to slowly dissipate the energy of the system and avoid 257 excessive spring oscillations . This force was defined as : 258 f (cid:12) = - cv (cid:2) m (cid:2) ( 9 ) 259 where c is the global damping coefficient and v (cid:2) is the velocity of the particle . To maintain 260 stable simulations and the fast convergence of the solution , all particles had a similar mass . 261 Particle mass was calculated as the total mass of the cell wall material divided by the number 262 of particles . The mass of cell wall material was estimated using the total area , thickness and 263 density of the cell walls . The density of the cell wall for all models was assumed to be 0 . 0015 264 g / mm 3 . 265 266 2 . 4 . Numerical solution . 267 In this study we chose an implicit Euler’s integration scheme with a fixed time step ∆t 268 for integrating the differential equations of motion . The linear system that describes the 269 mechanical behavior of our model was solved using the Conjugate Gradient ( CG ) approach 270 ( Baraff et al . , 1998 , 2001 , Volino et al . , 2000 ) .

View Article Online DOI : 10 . 1039 / C7SM01137G highly skewed log - normal distributions ( Fig . 3a and 3c ) and one normal distribution ( Fig . 3b ) 278 were applied . The response of the tissue generator to initial conditions was characterized 279 using the statistical distributions of cell volumes ( Figure 3d , e , f ) . 280 281 282 Fig . 3 . Three distributions of the input values of the threshold radius ( a , b , c ) and the 283 distributions generated of cell volumes of the virtual structures ( d , e , f ) . The “Sk” stands for 284 skewness and “Kur” stands for kurtosis . 285 The clear influence of the initial conditions on the resulting volume distributions were 286 observed for left - side skewed ( Fig . 3a and 3d ) and normal distributions ( Fig . 3b and 3e ) . In 287 both cases the shape of the cell volumes distribution was similar to the shape of the threshold 288 radius distribution . Also , in both cases an increase or decrease in the average threshold radius 289 value ( shift of the distribution to the left or right ) resulted in a similar response ( data not 290 shown ) . However , it was also observed that the structures generated by the algorithm based 291 on a random process do not necessarily reflect the geometrical constraints imposed by the 292 initial conditions – the centroid separation radii . In some cases the shape of the distribution of 293 the centroid separation radii was not reflected by the shape of the distribution of cell volumes . 294 This was clearly visible in the example of the right - side skewed distribution presented in Fig . 295 3c , which caused the generation of the structure with the largest cells as expected , however , 296 the distribution of cell volumes were similar to the normal distributions ( Fig . 3c and 3f ) . The 297 combination of termination criterion during structure generation with the space exclusion 298 criterion based on the spherical shapes assigned to the generated points , promoted structures 299 with left - side skewed or normally distributed volumes of cells . Due to the sphere - based 300 exclusion rule only a small number of points with large values of threshold radius fit into the 301 desired space . Since the algorithm runs until the termination criterion is satisfied the 302 remaining space was gradually filled with small cells that fit into gaps between the larger 303 ones . Therefore , even with a right - side skewed distribution of threshold radius ( Fig . 3c ) the 304 resulting distribution of cell volumes tended to fall into the category of normal or left - side 305 skewed log - normal distributions . However , it should also be noted that unusual statistical 306 distributions such as those presented in Figure 4c are rarely found in nature and they do not 307 coincide with the actual structural features of plant tissues . It is necessary to mention that at 308 this stage of the development of the algorithm , the shape of cells depends entirely on the 309 Page 8 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

This could be partially solved in a future study by the 310 introduction of various shapes into the space exclusion rule , for instance the ellipsoid . 311 Although it has different underlying principles , our algorithm demonstrated a comparable 312 performance with the algorithm based on the cell growth model developed by Abera et al . 313 ( 2014 ) in terms of the shapes of generated structures . Both methods were able to generate 314 structures with cell size distributions close to normal and a relatively high variability in cell 315 dimensions . However , the two algorithms differ in the method of pore space generation . 316 Abera et al . ( 2014 ) proposed a sophisticated approach that took into account two different 317 mechanisms of pore space creation originating from schizogenous and lysigenous processes . 318 In our model , random cells were removed from the dense structure until the desired porosity 319 was achieved . Therefore , the connectivity of pore spaces was not preserved . 320 321 3 . 2 . Simulations of plant tissue compression experiment 322 3 . 2 . 1 . Boundary conditions and simulation setup 323 Simulation constraints were set up to reproduce a uniaxial compression experiment in a 324 numerical environment . The quasi - static / uniaxial compression was simulated between two 325 rigid , non - deformable , horizontally oriented plates . The position of the lower plate was fixed 326 while the upper plate was moving with a constant velocity . The velocity of the upper plate 327 was equal to 1 . 5 mm / min . Open boundary conditions were applied in the case of all 328 compression simulations . The collision model only included force interactions between cell 329 walls of the generated tissue and the plates . The mechanics of neighboring cell walls was 330 modeled after no - slip boundary conditions , i . e . the cell walls of neighboring cells formed 331 double layered boundaries with a thickness equal to twice the assumed thickness of the cell 332 wall . The neighboring cells shared the cell wall particles , however , they had separate spring 333 elements . Therefore , the neighboring cells were permanently “glued” to each other . Collisions 334 of cell walls that were not initially in contact ( for instance the cell walls of cells that 335 surrounded pore spaces ) were not taken into account . To avoid the closure of the intercellular 336 spaces and the collapse of the tissue structure , simulations were carried out up to a strain 337 factor of 8 % . The simulation time step was 0 . 0001 s , which was a compromise between rapid 338 computations and stable calculations . The cell wall material was assumed to be non - 339 permeable , therefore there was no water loss during the simulation . 340 341 342 3 . 2 . 2 . Single cell simulation . 343 A preliminary analysis of the modeling framework was carried out prior to the simulations of 344 bulk tissue compression . A simple solver performance test was carried out regarding the 345 independence of the meshing resolution and the independence of the CG convergence 346 criterion ( ε , Section 5 . 3 ) using a number of iterations . Tests were performed on a simplified 347 mechanical system – namely the single cell model . The cell was modeled as a sphere with a 348 diameter of 100 µm . The same boundary conditions and simulation setup parameters were 349 applied as described in section 3 . 2 . 1 . Model parameters from structural analysis studies were 350 used ( Table 1 . ) . Fig . 4 shows the resulting force - strain curves for a single cell model 351 compression . 352 353 354 Page 9 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

A similar non - linear concave 362 force - deformation response was reported for single tomato ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) and yeast cells 363 ( Smith et al . , 2000 ) during compression experiments . Our model also performed remarkably 364 well when compared to other modeling approaches . Again , a similar relationship between the 365 compression force and deformation was reported for the finite element model developed by 366 Dintwa et al . ( 2011 ) and the particle - based model demonstrated by Van Lindekirke et al . 367 ( 2010 ) . However , due to a number of unknown input parameters , we were unable to carry out 368 a quantitative comparison between the models . The applied numerical solution showed the 369 high independence of the CG convergence tolerance value ε ( Fig . 4a ) . The resulting force - 370 strain curves showed no difference regardless of the applied value of ε . Minor differences 371 were only visible at higher strain values ( strain above 10 % ) . Similar results were obtained in 372 the case of a number of iterations ( Fig . 4c ) . The mesh resolution had the highest influence on 373 the quality of the results obtained ( Fig . 4b ) . The lower the mesh density ( lower number of 374 triangular elements ) the less stable the behavior of the model . Lower solver performance was 375 mainly related to contact simulation and cell volume calculation . Low mesh density in the 376 contact area resulted in the low accuracy of calculations . A decrease in mesh density also 377 resulted in an increase of susceptibility to small variations in particle positions which directly 378 affected the volume calculations , leading to volume oscillations at higher cell interior 379 stiffness values . Despite the less regular shape of the force - strain curve for the low resolution 380 mesh , the force values remained very close to the results obtained for surfaces with more 381 refined discretization . 382 383 3 . 2 . 3 . The effect of tissue structure 384 Models were generated in order to study the mechanical behavior of virtual tissues with 385 different structural properties . In total , 75 geometrical models were generated based on three 386 distributions varying in average cell volume . The distributions of cell volumes are presented 387 in Figures 5 a , b and c while the model data corresponding to these distributions are shown in 388 table 1 . The virtual tissue had the form of cubes with an edge length of 1 mm . Five variants of 389 porosity 0 % , 5 % , 10 % , 15 % and 20 % were tested for each of the three distributions . To 390 ensure the statistical representativeness of the simulations , five structures were generated for 391 each combination of cell volume and tissue porosity . The number of cells generated in the 392 sample varied from 184 , for structures consisting of large cells with 20 % porosity up to 550 393 cells for dense tissue composed of small cells with 0 % porosity . 394 395 396 Page 10 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

The resulting force - strain curves were averaged for each 400 group of samples and shown in Figures 5d , e , and f . The force - strain curves obtained were in 401 agreement with the expectations and data found in the literature ( Scanlon et al . , 1996 , 402 Konstankiewicz et al . , 2001 , Oey et al . , 2006 ) . They are similar to the curves obtained for 403 single cell models ( Dintwa et al . , 2011 , Van Lindekerke et al . , 2010 ) and tissue models at 404 similar strains ( Loodts et al . , 2006 , Van Lindekerke et al . , 2011 ) and had a concave upwards 405 shape . Structurally , the plant cell wall is a fibrous biopolymer based on a soft hydrated pectin 406 matrix enforced with stiff cellulose fibers ( Hamman , 2012 , Cosgrove et al . , 2012 ) . The 407 deformation behavior for the fibrous cell walls of plant tissues may be studied in three phases 408 ( Holzapfel , 2004 ) . During the first phase ( Fig . 5d , strain below 3 % ) the force - strain 409 relationship is approximately linear and the elastic modulus of the tissue is low . The vast 410 majority of the cellulose fibers are not in tension . The load is transferred mainly by the 411 polymeric matrix . In the second phase ( Fig . 5d , at a strain of ~ 3 % to ~ 6 % ) , as the load is 412 increased , fibers gradually elongate and they interact with the hydrated matrix . Based on the 413 micromechanical model of cell wall deformation proposed by Spatz et al . ( 1999 ) and Köhler 414 et al . ( 2000 ) the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils changes due to increasing tensile 415 stress , resulting in a decreased microfibrillar angle . The cellulose fibers line up with the load 416 direction and bear loads , resulting in structural stiffening . During the third phase ( Fig . 5d , 417 strain above 6 % ) the majority of cellulose fibers are under tension , and aligned with one 418 another in the direction in which the load is applied . The stress - strain relationship becomes 419 linear again . It should also be emphasized that material properties are not the only source of a 420 concave force – strain curve . With the negligible impact of the viscous properties of the cell 421 walls ( lack of plasticity due to low cell wall damping coefficient values ) and neglecting cell 422 wall mechanical damage , this behavior may result from the geometric nonlinearity induced by 423 the structural parameters of virtual tissue . Pitt and Davis ( 1984 ) showed that in the case of 424 plant tissues , the nonlinear response to the applied load is a combination of the effects 425 induced by the cell wall geometry and the cellular fluid . This effect was clearly evident during 426 the simulation of compression of unpressurized spherical cells with the linearly elastic 427 material model , which showed a nonlinear , concave force – strain curve . 428 Page 11 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

The results of simulations of quasi - static compression experiments : force - strain curves 430 obtained for tissues with different porosities ( d , e , f ) with the corresponding distributions of 431 cell volumes for three types of tested structures ( a , b , c ) . 432 433 For all three types of structure , the total reaction force at 8 % of strain was twice as high 434 for dense tissue without intercellular spaces than for structures with 20 % of the intercellular 435 space occupied by pores . In general , it was observed that during compression , the structures 436 composed of smaller cells produced higher reaction forces , and therefore were stiffer than the 437 structures with larger cells . This is in line with the experimental observations on potato tissue 438 ( Zdunek and Umeda 2006 ) . The increase in porosity resulted in a decrease in reaction forces . 439 This effect was clearly visible for structures composed of small and average sized cells ( Fig . 440 5d and 5e ) . For structures composed of large cells ( Fig . 5f ) this effect was much less 441 significant . This was probably caused due to the small overall size of the sample in 442 comparison with the average volume of the cells . 443 The differences in response to the applied strain were also investigated in terms of 444 changes in the internal pressure of the cell and cell wall stress . Figures 6 and 7 show the cross 445 sections of cubic samples of virtual tissue at 8 % strain . The highest increase in the internal 446 pressure of the cell was demonstrated for structures with small cells and without intercellular 447 spaces or with a low proportion of pore spaces ( 5 % ) . A similar effect was observed for cell 448 wall stress , i . e . the highest cell wall stress was reported for compact structures with small cells 449 and a low proportion of intercellular spaces . It was also noted that stress accumulated at the 450 edges of cell walls where three cells meet . This demonstrated that cell - to - cell debonding and 451 crack propagation through the contact edge of neighboring cells is a prevalent process of 452 tissue rupture when the tissue consists of small cells and no intercellular spaces . A similar 453 conclusion was drawn by Van Lindekerke et al . ( 2011 ) who , based on the SPH - DEM model , 454 pointed out that dense structures show a higher susceptibility to bruising at relatively low 455 strains . The increase in cell volumes resulted in a decrease in both internal pressure changes 456 and cell wall stress for compact structures ( 0 % and 5 % porosity ) . This effect was visible , 457 especially for cells located closer to the center of the sample . It may be concluded that , in this 458 case , the rupturing of cell walls is promoted from the center of the sample . 459 460 Page 12 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

Cross - sections of compressed virtual tissues at 8 % strain for different porosity values , 462 showing an increase in internal pressure for individual cells . 463 When the proportion of intercellular spaces increased to a level above 5 % , the changes 464 in internal pressure became less significant and showed almost no dependence on cell size . 465 For structures with small cells , cell wall stress decreased with porosity . However , for 466 structures composed of medium and large cells , the effect was hardly visible . Also , for 467 porosity values above 5 % , the stress did not indicate a relationship with cells size . 468 469 Fig . 7 .

Relative changes in initial cross - section area at 8 % strain for different types of tested 476 structures . 477 The Poisson effect was also investigated . This effect describes the tendency of 478 compressed material to expand in the two directions perpendicular to the direction of 479 compression . Since the sides of the cubic samples were irregular due to the geometry of the 480 cell tissue , transversal expansion was measured as a percentage change in the initial cross - 481 section area at 8 % strain ( Fig . 8 ) . 482 483 484 485 Table 2 . Model parameters from the structural and sensitivity analysis . 486 487 488 For structures with up to 10 % porosity , with an increase in cell size , the transverse 489 expansion of the tissue decreased . The relative changes had a positive sign , which means that 490 the tissue expanded outward . Similar to the force - strain curves , this effect was less significant 491 for structures with the largest cells ; this was caused by a relatively small number of cells and 492 therefore a small representative of the virtual sample . This effect changed radically for 493 structures with 15 % and 20 % of their volume occupied by pore spaces . In this case , the 494 smallest transverse expansions were reported for structures with the smallest cells . Moreover , 495 for tissues with medium and large sized cells , the sign of relative changes in area switched 496 Page 14 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

This means that structures started to collapse inward . Also , the 497 extent of the contraction increased with an increase in the average volume of the cells . This 498 unexpected behavior may result from the lower stiffness of the tissue structure combined with 499 a high number of pore spaces which could result in mechanical behavior similar to internal 500 cell wall buckling . 501 502 3 . 2 . 4 . Sensitivity to the cell wall modulus , cell wall thickness , cell wall damping 503 coefficient , cell interior stiffness and global damping coefficient . 504 The sensitivities of all model parameters were tested using the same structures previously 505 generated for structural sensitivity analysis . The model with an average cell volume equal to 506 0 . 17 x 10 - 2 mm 3 ( medium sized cells ) and porosity of tissue equal to 5 % was chosen . The 507 same boundary conditions and simulation setup with parameters which were described in 508 Section 3 . 2 . 1 were used to reproduce a uniaxial compression experiment . The results of the 509 simulations are demonstrated in Figures 9 and 10 while the model parameters are shown in 510 Table 2 . 511 The cell wall elastic modulus ( E ) can vary significantly depending on the tissue sample as 512 well as the scale of the measurements . Usually measurements carried out on single cells or 513 samples of cell walls produce higher values of E than macroscopic measurements on tissue 514 samples . Hiller et al . ( 1996 ) reported a value of 3GPa for the cell walls of potato tuber 515 parenchyma tissue , while 2 . 3GPa was measured for a single tomato suspension cell ( Dintwa 516 et al . , 2011 ) . A value of 150 MPa for the cell walls of yeast cells was measured by Smith et 517 al . ( 2000 ) . The cell wall Young’s modulus of the inner pericarp tissue of tomatoes was 518 measured by Wang et al . ( 2006 ) it ranged from 30 to 80 MPa . Contrary to this , the Young’s 519 modulus of the primary cell walls measured using atomic force microscopy measured for 520 pears ranged from 1 . 9 to 3 . 2 MPa ( Zdunek et al . , 2016 ) . On the other hand , measurements at 521 larger scales provide results with significantly lower values of mechanical parameters ( Oey et 522 al . , 2007 , Vanstreels et al . , 2005 ) . This shows that the mechanical properties of tissues at 523 different scales are influenced by a number of undefined factors , both originating from the 524 material investigated and the technique used . 525 In this study the sensitivity of the model to the cell wall E , was conducted in a series of 526 simulations by varying E from 100 MPa to 200 MPa in five steps . An increase in the cell wall 527 modulus resulted in a proportional increase in the compression reaction forces of the whole 528 structure . An increase in E values caused an increase in the slope of the force - strain curve . 529 The curvilinear shape of the force - strain curve was unchanged within the tested range of 530 strain . Doubling the Young’s modulus of the cell wall resulted in reaction forces starting from 531 the very beginning of the compression that were twice as high . A similar effect was observed 532 in our previous studies ( Pieczywek et al . , 2014 ) with an FEM model of onion epidermis 533 tissue . 534 For cell wall thickness the results also showed an increase in reaction forces ( Fig . 9b ) . 535 Similar conclusions were drawn by Dintwa et al . ( 2011 ) in the case of finite element models 536 of single tomato cells . As was the case with the cell wall modulus , the response was 537 proportional – tripling the thickness of the cell wall resulted in reaction forces three times 538 higher at the end of the compression test . This indicated the high sensitivity of the model to 539 cell wall parameters , thus valid results for a quantitative comparison require precise 540 measurements of cell wall thickness and Young’s modulus . 541 542 Page 15 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

Results of the sensitivity analysis - response of the model to changes in the cell wall ; 544 Young’s modulus ( a ) cell wall thickness ( b ) and cell interior stiffness ( c ) . 545 546 The cell wall damping coefficient showed very little or no effect on the reaction forces during 547 compression ( data not shown ) . Several explanations are possible for this effect . First of all the 548 applied range of the damping coefficient could be too small to show any influence on the 549 resulting reaction forces . Unfortunately , due to simulation stability issues it was not possible 550 to test a broader range of this parameter . It is also possible that at the applied deformation rate 551 viscous effects were negligible . Also , the range of applied strains was relatively small and 552 therefore we were unable to observe the biphasic behavior ( elastic - plastic deformation ) , 553 which was reported by Van Lindekerke et al . ( 2010 ) . 554 555 556 Fig . 10 . Results of the sensitivity analysis – results for the global damping coefficient for 557 compression experiment ( a ) and compress - hold tests ( b ) . 558 559 The results were insensitive to the value of c , as long it was large enough to stabilize 560 the simulation and smaller than 2000 N·s / mm·kg , On the other hand , when c was large the 561 global damping coefficient showed a very strong influence on the mechanical behavior of the 562 virtual tissue under compression ( Fig . 10a ) . An increase in the value of this parameter resulted 563 in an increase in the total compressive force . Furthermore , the force - strain curve changed 564 shape from concave upwards to biphasic , showing high comparability with results obtained by 565 Van Lindekerke et al . ( 2010 , 2011 ) and Pieczywek et al . ( 2014 ) . Such a result was expected 566 in the case of the cell wall damping coefficient , however , in this case it was obtained with 567 relatively minor changes in the values of c and without any stability issues . 568 Additional compress - hold tests ( compress to 8 % strain and hold for the same time as the 569 compression took , showed on Fig . 10b ) showed that for c above 2000 N·s / mm·kg the 570 alteration of the shape of the force - strain curve was caused by the force - relaxation 571 phenomena . Up to c = 2000 N·s / mm·kg the relaxation did not occur within the simulation 572 timescale . Starting from c = 4000 N·s / mm·kg a clear drop down and the stabilization of the 573 compression force was observed after reaching 8 % strain . The comparison of force readings 574 also showed the difference between the forces on the upper and lower plate during the 575 Page 16 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

The difference increased with the increase in c value . During the relaxation 576 force , values on both plates equalized . This showed that at high values of c the global 577 damping force breaks the translation invariance . Since the inertial effects were no longer 578 negligible ( time and inertial mass are no longer irrelevant ) the compression could not be 579 treated as a quasi - static process . This is an interesting observation since global damping was 580 introduced to the model in order to produce a mechanical system with more stable behavior . It 581 should be emphasized that this parameter describes environmental conditions rather than the 582 material properties of cell walls . In this context c should be carefully chosen since at high 583 values it changes the mechanical behavior of the cell wall material . 584 A number of studies has shown the significant effect of turgor on the micromechanical 585 properties of plant tissues . The turgor effect was observed for onion epidermis , potato tuber 586 and apple parenchyma tissue , during compression and tensile experiments ( Scanlon et al . , 587 1996 , Konstankiewicz et al . , 2001 , Oey et al . , 2006 , Pieczywek et al . , 2014 ) . This 588 phenomenon was explained by the effect of stress hardening through turgor . Due to an 589 increase in intercellular pressure , the tension in the cell walls also increased , resulting in the 590 stiffening of the whole structure , while the inherent properties of the cell wall material 591 remained constant . Compression experiments carried out on potato tuber parenchyma tissue 592 showed that an increase in turgor pressure resulted in a decrease in critical stress and strain 593 values ( Lin and Pit , 1986 , Scanlon et al . , 1996 , Konstankiewicz et al . , 2001 ) . This effect was 594 attributed to an increase in the initial tension of the cell walls due to an increase in 595 intracellular pressure . 596 In this study cell turgor is described by the linear spring - like volume elasticity K 597 which generates cell wall pressure forces that tend to maintain the initial cell volume . 598 Changes in turgor were approximated by changes in the interior stiffness coefficient K of the 599 cell . The model of the interior of the cell proposed in this study is different to the models 600 presented previously by Karunasena et al . ( 2014a , 2014b ) and Van Lindekerke et al . ( 2010 , 601 2011 ) . In these cases simulations began with a pressurization stage as a slow increase in 602 pressure up to a desired value until equilibrium was achieved between internal pressure and 603 cell wall tension . This leads to the issue of the initial state of the tissue structure since 604 pressurization changes with the initial volumes , shapes and positions of the cells . Another 605 difficulty which may be encountered is the extreme swelling of the boundary cells during cell 606 pressurization ( Fozard et al . , 2013 ) . This behavior is undesirable when the initial structure 607 depicts tissue in an already pressurized state – for instance when the structure is created based 608 on microscopic images or – as in this study – it is generated via a computer programme . In an 609 ideal case , we would like to reach the desired internal pressure , while keeping the initial 610 structure intact . However , finding the right balance between cell wall stiffness and the internal 611 pressure of the cell is a difficult task . Also , to prevent the swelling of the boundary cells the 612 stiffness of the boundary cell walls should be higher than that of other cells . In this study we 613 encountered this issue as severe structural changes in tissue structure during pressurization 614 which finally led to deformed virtual tissue . Since the final geometrical characteristics of 615 pressurized cells were far from desirable , we decided to apply a different approach . As a 616 compromise , we assumed that the structure equilibrium state existed at the very beginning of 617 the simulation . The pressure increases or decreases in response to relative changes in cell 618 volume with a rate that depends on the interior stiffness coefficient of the cell . Therefore , 619 contraction and repulsion forces act on the cell walls to maintain the initial volume of the cell . 620 When this volume is reached , the force values are equal to zero . The major drawback of this 621 approach is that when the simulation begins , the cell walls are not in tension . Therefore , this 622 model is not suitable for simulations of the initial stress of cell walls . The changes in the 623 interior stiffness coefficient of the cells showed the significant , but non - linear response of the 624 model . The tenfold increase in the K value from 0 . 0001 to 0 . 001 showed almost the same 625 Page 17 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

View Article Online DOI : 10 . 1039 / C7SM01137G increase in the total reaction force value at 8 % strain as was the case with a threefold increase 626 from 0 . 01 to 0 . 03 . Despite the number of changes , in general , the increase in the K value 627 resulted in an increase of the total reaction forces and a stiffness of the virtual tissue . This 628 observation was in agreement with the results obtained by Van Lindekerke et al . ( 2010 ) for 629 single cell model compression . From the slopes of the curves , they concluded that higher 630 turgor leads to a stiffer system , but only for small deformations . At higher strain however , all 631 curves were parallel , i . e . , cells had the same stiffness . In our simulations , the slopes of the 632 curves increased with an increase in the K value at low strains . At higher strains the force 633 curves showed similar slopes for K values above 0 . 01 . Results also showed that this model 634 had limited capabilities of reproducing the effect of stress hardening through turgor . An 635 increase in the K value leads to an increase in compressive force and therefore a shift of the 636 critical force / stress factor to lower strain values . However , since the initial stress of the cell 637 walls was equal to zero , the critical force / stress value would remain the same . 638 639 4 . Conclusions 640 A new 3 - D mezo - scale model of plant tissue mechanical behavior under external load 641 conditions has been developed using the Mass – Spring Systems methodology coupled with a 642 Discrete Element Method . The model is based on a particle approach where particles which 643 covered the surfaces of the cell walls were interconnected by a triangle mesh network of 644 viscoelastic springs . Mathematical definitions of the interaction between neighboring particles 645 modeled the properties of continuous membrane material . A simplified approximate 646 implementation of various mechanical features ( a model of the cell fluid for instance ) 647 significantly improved the efficiency of the computations . Reduced computation time allowed 648 for the simulation of relatively large structures , composed of up to several hundred cells at an 649 individual cellular level of detail , with the possibility of direct reproduction of virtual 650 experiments and therefore validation of the model . 651 The realistic representation of cellular structure was generated via a numerical 652 algorithm . The spatial arrangement of the virtual tissue was obtained using Poisson - disc 653 sampling and Voronoi tessellation in 3 - D space . The algorithm allowed control over the 654 process of the generation of a structure in terms of the desired cell sizes and porosity of the 655 virtual tissue . In the current implementation , the algorithm did not allow for control over the 656 shapes and orientations of the cells , however , this issue may be solved by simple 657 modifications of the rules of the computational method ( for instance , the space exclusivity 658 rule described in Section 2 . 1 . ) The model demonstrated the significant influence of tissue 659 structure on micromechanical properties and allowed for the interpretation of the compression 660 test results with respect to changes occurring in the structure of the virtual tissue . During 661 compression the virtual structures composed of the smaller cells produced higher reaction 662 forces and were therefore stiffer than the structures with larger cells . The increase in the 663 proportion of intercellular spaces ( porosity ) resulted in a decrease in reaction forces . The 664 numerical model was capable of simulating the quasi - static compression experiment and 665 reproducing force - strain curves that matched the experimental data reported in the literature 666 within the tested range of strain . It was also noted that stress accumulated at the edges where 667 three cells meet . This suggested that cell - to - cell debonding and crack propagation through 668 contact with the edge of neighboring cells is one of the most prevalent mechanisms of tissue 669 rupture . 670 Although the numerical model was developed for the purpose of the simulation of the 671 micro - mechanics of plant tissue , due to its flexibility , simple implementation and scalability it 672 may also be easily generalized into a functional description of the mechanical behavior of 673 porous materials . This leaves the field open for practical applications , for instance , to simulate 674 Page 18 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

Further research will be required to explore 675 the capabilities of the framework presented . 676 677 678 5 . Appendix 679 5 . 1 . Structure generator 680 The virtual tissue structure was generated numerically using an algorithm based on 681 Poisson - disc sampling in 3D space . In contrast to the conventional process of Poisson - disc 682 sampling , the value of the threshold radius of each point was assigned randomly from a log - 683 normal distribution . To improve the efficiency of the algorithm , the space occupied by the 684 virtual tissue was initially discretized using a rectangular grid . When a new point was 685 generated , all grid cells , the centroids of which lay inside the threshold sphere ( defined by 686 point coordinates and assigned a radius value ) , were marked as occupied . A new point could 687 not be created inside a grid cell that was already occupied . Single grid cells could only be 688 occupied by one sphere , with the exception of “boundary” grid cells . The boundary grid cells 689 were defined as cells lying near the surface of spheres . In practice , the adjustable tolerance 690 value defined how much two neighboring spheres could partially overlap ( “boundary” grid 691 cells are shown in Fig . 1 by unfilled dots and occupied grid cells by black dots ) . By loosening 692 these criteria , the process of filling the empty space was accelerated and led to more natural 693 looking patterns . 694 Due to the nature of the numerical calculations , this process may result in the creation of 695 cells that possess very small faces or very short edges . Such small structures inserted into 696 numerical solvers dedicated to simulations of the mechanical behavior of soft solids act as 697 rigid constraints and result in concentrations of stress . To avoid excessively small edges and 698 faces we introduced the ‘jittering’ procedure . It is an iterative process which , after 699 tessellation , checks all virtual cells and shifts the location of the centroids of the cells 700 generated with short edges by random and relatively small vectors . After centroid relocation 701 tessellation is carried out again . This process was repeated until all of the generated cells had 702 edges with lengths above the threshold value , or the algorithm reached the maximum number 703 of iterations . 704 Even though DEM is considered to be a meshless method , our model required the cell 705 wall surfaces to be initially discretized . The purpose of discretization was to establish the 706 spring network using the edges of the three - dimensional membrane elements . In our study , 707 cell walls were discretized with a triangular mesh , using the discretization module provided 708 by ANSYS 11 Academic Release software ( ANSYS Inc . , USA ) . This operation was carried 709 out only once to obtain an even spread of the vertices of discrete elements on the cell wall 710 surfaces . 711 The presence of intercellular spaces has a significant influence on the physical 712 properties of tissues , this effect varies with the proportion of such spaces : from 1 % for tissues 713 that contain densely - packed polygonal cells like potato and carrot parenchyma , to over 30 % 714 in the case of apples ( Mebatsion et al . , 2009 , Pieczywek et al . , 2012 ) . In order to account for 715 this structural feature in our model , random cells were removed from the dense structure until 716 the desired porosity was achieved . It should be noted that as a consequence of using this 717 approach , the connectivity of the pore spaces was not preserved . An example of a numerically 718 generated structure with pore spaces is presented in Figure 1 ( cubic section of the geometric 719 model highlighted with a circle ) . 720 Finally , the geometry of the virtual tissue was refined and smoothed . This was 721 accomplished by the weighted averaging of coordinates of neighboring vertices . 722 Neighborhood boundaries were defined by an arbitrarily chosen distance value . Averaging 723 was carried out using inverse distance weights ( the further away the neighbor is located the 724 Page 19 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

The results of this operation are shown 725 in Fig . 1 ( an example of a single cell and whole tissue structure ) . 726 727 5 . 2 . Integration scheme 728 The main difficulty with MSS models is that their numerical formulations involve stiff 729 differential equations which result in convergence and stability problems ( Baraff et al . , 1998 , 730 Mesit et al . , 2007 ) . In this study we chose an implicit Euler’s integration scheme with a fixed 731 time step ∆t for integrating the differential equations of motion . For a dynamic motion of the 732 particle system the aim of the implicit Euler’s method is to evaluate forces F ( x (cid:31) + Δx , v (cid:31) + 733 Δv ) forward in time ∆t and find a new position x (cid:31) + Δx and velocity v (cid:31) + Δv of the particle , 734 so that if we execute step - F ( x (cid:31) + Δx , v (cid:31) + Δv ) ∆t we will ultimately arrive at x (cid:31) and v (cid:31) . This 735 may be expressed in the following equation system : 736 ∆x = ( v (cid:31) + ∆v ) ∆t ( 10 ) 737 ∆v = M - * F ( x (cid:31) + Δx , v (cid:31) + Δv ) ∆t ( 11 ) 738 where M represents the mass distribution of the particle system . The implicit approach 739 requires the linearization of this system by replacing particle forces F with a linear 740 approximation , based on the Taylor series expansion : 741 F ( x (cid:31) + Δx , v (cid:31) + Δv ) = F (cid:31) + UV U(cid:17) Δx + UV UC Δv ( 12 ) 742 Substituting ( 12 ) into ( 11 ) and regrouping yields : 743 F ( x (cid:31) + Δx , v (cid:31) + Δv ) = F (cid:31) + UV U(cid:17) Δx + UV UC Δv ( 13 ) 744 And more concisely : 745 A∆v = b ( 14 ) 746 The full run of the backward Euler step consists of the calculation of initial forces F (cid:31) , 747 ∂F / ∂x , ∂F / ∂v forming matrices A and b of the linear system ( 14 ) and solving it for ∆v . 748 With ∆v revealing the new positions of particles which are calculated as x = x (cid:31) + h ( v (cid:31) + 749 Δv ) . For a system of n particles , the matrices A , M , ∂F / ∂x and ∂F / ∂v are composed of n × 750 n submatrices , where each submatrix is a 3 × 3 matrix of scalars . The vector b in the system 751 ( 14 ) is stored as an n element array of three component vectors . 752 Symbols of partial derivatives ∂F / ∂x and ∂F / ∂v stand for the Jacobian matrix which 753 relates force variations with respect to the positions and velocities of the particles . The 754 structure of these matrices directly reflects the underlying topology of the mass - spring 755 network , thus the interactions between particles in the system . Diagonal entries of ∂F / ∂x and 756 ∂F / ∂v show the contributions of independent interactions to the particles while non - diagonal 757 entries show the contributions resulting from an interaction between particle pairs . 758 Using the sparse nature of the resulting linear system ( 14 ) the integration process can be 759 highly simplified by the implementation of simple sparse storage techniques and performing 760 calculations only on the non - zero entries of individual matrices ( indicated by particle - particle 761 interactions ) . This also eliminates the necessity of the explicit storage of matrices ( Baraff et 762 al . , 1998 , 2001 , Volino et al . , 2000 ) . 763 764 765 Page 20 of 24 Soft Matter S o ft M a tt e r A cce p t e d M a nu sc r i p t P ub li s h e d on 18 S e p t e m b e r 2017 .

Linear system solution 766 The linear system that describes the mechanical behavior of our model was solved using 767 the Conjugate Gradient approach ( Baraff et al . , 1998 , 2001 , Volino et al . , 2000 ) . The 768 Conjugate Gradient method is an iterative method that simultaneously and symmetrically 769 resolves the equations of the linear system . The CG method was solved iteratively ; A∆v = b , 770 until Wb - A∆vW was less than ‖εb‖ where ε was the arbitrarily defined tolerance value . The 771 lower the ε value , the more accurate the solution was , but the larger the number of iterations 772 taken . The main advantage of the CG algorithm is that it exploits the sparse structure of large 773 linear systems generated by the implicit integration method . To provide a solution of the final 774 equation the algorithm required only matrix - vector multiplications . Thus , the complexity of 775 this operation was reduced to multiplications of 3 x 3 non - zero blocks of the sparse matrix by 776 3 element vectors . 777 778 5 . 4 . Implementation 779 The DEM - MSS simulation framework was responsible for all of the simulations which 780 were implemented as a multi - platform and multi - thread code using the C + + programming 781 language . The code was compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Desktop 782 ( Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , WA , USA ) and written using the Standard Template 783 Library ( STL ) , a C + + library that provides many of the basic algorithms and data structures of 784 computer science . The structure generator was written as a code for the MATLAB 11 785 ( MathWorks , U . S . A . ) computing environment . All simulations were performed on a standard 786 desktop workstation with an Intel® Core™ i7 3 . 07 GHz CPU unit and 12 GB RAM memory , 787 running on a Windows 7 64 - bit ( Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , WA , USA ) operating 788 system . 789 790 References 791 1 .
