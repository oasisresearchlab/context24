Published online 6 July 2006 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nprot . 2006 . 86 This protocol describes a high - efﬁciency Ca 2 + - phosphate transfection method with low cell toxicity . The Ca 2 + - phosphate transfection method is widely used in transfecting neurons because of its low cell toxicity and simplicity in use , but the efﬁciency is typically low ( B 1 – 5 % ) . To solve this problem we have developed a new Ca 2 + - phosphate transfection protocol that increases the efﬁciency by 10 - fold ( r 60 % ) , while maintaining low cell toxicity . First , it is critical to have gentle mixing of the DNA - Ca 2 + solution with phosphate buffer to form a homogeneous snowlike precipitate ( particle size 1 – 3 l m ) . Second , the precipitate should be dissolved using a slightly acidic culture medium to reduce cell toxicity . The high efﬁciency of this new protocol makes it possible to transfect single autaptic neurons as well as mature neurons ( 15 – 82 days in vitro ) for gene functional analysis . The total time required for the protocol is 2 – 4 h ( including 45 min – 3 h incubation time ) . INTRODUCTION Neuronal cells are among the most difﬁcult cells to transfect with DNA , because they are very sensitive to microenvironmental changes and die easily after transfection . Ca 2 + - phosphate transfec - tion is one of the mostly used methods for transfecting neurons because of its low toxicity and ease of use 1 – 6 . However , compared with some other transfection methods such as liposome fusion and viral infection , the transfection efﬁciency of the classical Ca 2 + - phosphate method is typically very low ( B 1 – 5 % on average ) 1 , 7 , 8 . The ultimate goal for every gene transfer method is to have high transfection efﬁciency but low cell toxicity . With the Ca 2 + - phos - phate method it is important to increase the transfection efﬁciency signiﬁcantly so as to broaden its applications in gene functional analysis . We have made a great effort to improve the transfection efﬁciency and identiﬁed some critical steps that might have limited the efﬁciency in previous protocols . One important element of Ca 2 + - phosphate transfection is the formation of precipitate particles of the appropriate size . It is believed that the DNA – Ca 2 + - phosphate precipitate enters cells through endocytosis and that some DNA molecules actually enter the nucleus 7 . Previous Ca 2 + - phosphate transfection protocols often recommend that the DNA - Ca 2 + solution be thoroughly mixed with phosphate buffer solution by continuous shaking on a vortexer . However , we have found that continuous vortexing often resulted in large and unevenly distributed precipitate . A much milder vortexing is recommended here so as to form smaller precipitate particles that can be easily endocytosed . Another critical improvement of this protocol is the dissolution of the DNA – Ca 2 + - phosphate precipitate after incubation . We dissolve the precipitate in trans - fection medium pre - equilibrated in a 10 % CO 2 incubator . This is because our normal culture medium and transfection medium are in a 5 % CO 2 incubator , and 10 % CO 2 will acidify the medium , facilitating the dissolution of small particles of Ca 2 + - phosphate . We found that dissolving the precipitate signiﬁcantly lowered the cell toxicity and allowed for much longer incubation with the precipitate so as to increase the transfection efﬁciency substan - tially . Other important steps include performing transfection in a new culture plate and returning the cells to the original plate containing the original culture medium after the comple - tion of transfection . With these improvements we are able to increase the transfection efﬁciency as much as 60 % in low - density primary neuronal cultures . Not only has such high efﬁciency never before been achieved , but it does not result in any signi - ﬁcant increase in cell toxicity because of the dissolution of the a b 1 µ g cDNA 3 . 1 µ l 2 M CaCl 2 XX µ l H 2 O 25 µ l total 25 µ l 2 × HBS Mix A with B Add A dropwise to B .

The table provides a typical composition of the precipitate for each 12 - mm round coverslip . m CRITICAL STEP Formation of the appropriate size of DNA – Ca 2 + - phosphate precipitate is critical to achieve the high efﬁciency . m CRITICAL STEP One important modiﬁcation of the original procedure is that when mixing solution A ( cDNA + CaCl 2 + H 2 O ) with solution B ( 2 (cid:1) HBS ) , one should add about 1 / 8 volume of solution A at a time into solution B in Eppendorf tubes by quickly pipetting several times and gently vortexing in a VWR MV1 mini vortexer for only 2 – 3 s at 600 r . p . m . 3 | Incubate the DNA mixture at room temperature ( 22 – 24 1 C ) for 15 – 20 min without any further vortexing so as to form ﬁne particles of precipitate . Overmixing will result in large clusters of precipitate ( Fig . 2a ) . 4 | Add the DNA – Ca 2 + - phosphate suspension solution dropwise to each coverslip ( 50 m l per coverslip ) . 5 | Incubate cells with the precipitate for 45 min to 3 h in a 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37 1 C . Longer incubation time increases the transfection efﬁciency with minimal effect on cell survival , because the precipitate is subsequently dissolved . After 20 – 60 min of incubation , if examined under a microscope , the precipitate should be homogeneous and resemble a cover of snow all over the ﬁeld ( see Fig . 2b , c ) . 6 | After incubation , dissolve the precipitate by incubating with transfection medium that has been pre - equilibrated in a 10 % CO 2 incubator at 37 1 C for 15 – 20 min . The 10 % CO 2 will make the medium more acidic , and Ca 2 + - phosphate will dissolve in acidic solution . m CRITICAL STEP It is essential to dissolve the precipitate after incubation to reduce the cell toxicity .

We recommend gentle and intermittent vortexing so as to form ﬁne precipitate particles that are evenly distributed throughout the whole ﬁeld like a snow cover ( Fig . 2b ) . This homogeneous layer of precipitation is critical for high transfection efﬁciency , possibly because it covers the whole cell surface and the ﬁne precipitate particles are easily endocytosed into cells . Dissolution of the DNA – Ca 2 + - phosphate precipitate The DNA - Ca 2 + - phosphate precipitate , once formed , will stay in the cell cultures . Previous protocols often do not have an effective way of dispensing with the precipitate . We found that long - term exposure of neurons to the ﬁne precipitation will lead to considerable cell toxicity . Therefore , it is critical to dissolve the precipitate after transfection . Simple washing with fresh transfection medium could not adequately remove the precipitate , and some neurons might die after repeated washing . We have developed a new method to effectively remove the precipitate using transfection medium pre - equilibrated in a 10 % CO 2 incubator , making the transfection medium slightly more acidic . Importantly , after adding the acidic medium , the plate should be placed in the 5 % CO 2 incubator , not the 10 % CO 2 incubator , because neurons will die if they remain there for 15 – 20 min . Figure 2c and d show neurons before and after dissolving the DNA - Ca 2 + - phosphate precipitate . The neurons are generally in good condition after dissolving the precipitate . High transfection efﬁciency in low - density hippocampal cultures One advantage of dissolving the DNA - Ca 2 + - phosphate precipitate at any given time is that it allows experimental determination of the optimal incubation time for each individual construct . We found that an incubation time of 45 min – 3 h is sufﬁcient for high transfection efﬁciency while maintaining low cell toxicity . Although a 3 - h incubation is longer than was previously used , it does not induce excessive cell death because we dissolve the precipitate after the incubation . Different plasmids may require different incubation times for efﬁcient transfection . The high transfection efﬁciency of our improved protocol is best illustrated in Figure 3a – c , where the majority of neurons in a local ﬁeld are successfully transfected with GFP . For example , in Figure 3c ( 1 , 2 ) , the entire microisland contained a total of 22 neurons , among which 17 neurons were transfected , corresponding to B 80 % transfection efﬁciency . Quantiﬁcation of the entire coverslip found 127 transfected neurons out of a total of 211 neurons , yielding a transfection rate of 60 . 2 % , which is far better than an average of 1 – 5 % in previous reports 1 , 12 , 13 . One important note is that using our protocol , the exogenous gene expression is very rapid . We detected GFP ﬂuorescence signal in transfected neurons within 4 h after transfection . We also imaged GFP - transfected neurons for more than a week after transfection . Transfection of single autaptic neurons in microisland cultures Microisland cultures containing only a few neurons or even single autaptic neuron have been used to study molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity 10 , 14 – 16 . The dramatic increase of the transfection efﬁciency of our improved protocol makes it possible to transfect single autaptic neurons in microisland cultures . Figure 4 shows a typical example of a single autaptic neuron transfected with GFP - tagged endophilin . Transfection of mature neurons in culture The Ca 2 + - phosphate transfection method has often been used for transfecting young neurons such as from 2 to 10 d in culture , whereas mature neurons are more difﬁcult to transfect a 1 b 1 c 1 a 2 b 2 c 2 Figure 3 | High transfection efﬁciency achieved with our improved protocol in low - density hippocampal cultures .

One disadvantage of transfecting young neurons is that the synaptic network is not well established and therefore some gene functional analysis cannot be properly carried out . It is ideal for certain experiments to be able to transfect mature neurons . Using our improved protocol , we found that neurons at a wide range of ages , from 2 to 82 d in culture , can be successfully transfected ( Fig . 5a – d ) . The successful transfection of 82 - d - old neurons is remarkable because it is very difﬁcult for neurons to survive for 3 months in cell culture , yet we are still able to transfect them , suggesting that our protocol has minimal cell toxicity for transfecting mature neurons . More practical application is perhaps the routine transfection of mature neurons around 20 d in culture , when neurons have established substantial synaptic connections ( Fig . 5c ) . High transfection efﬁciency in neurons but not glial cells Our neuronal cultures contain many glial cells , because our neurons are plated on a monolayer of cortical astrocytes . If astrocytes are highly transfected like neurons , it will generate a high background signal ( such as in the GFP case ) or even directly affect neuronal functions through neuron - glial interaction . Notably , although there are numerous glial cells in our cultures , only a few of them are transfected ( Fig . 6a ) . One possible explanation is that we used cytosine arabinoside to stop glial proliferation , which may also suppress the transfection of glial cells . We also performed transfection in Banker - type culture in which neurons are usually not in contact with glial cells ( Fig . 6b ) . There is little variation between the transfection efﬁcacy of low - density cultures with ( 25 . 2 % ) or without astrocytes ( 21 . 6 % ) . In addition , our protocol is applicable to a variety of DNA constructs for transfecting neurons in culture ( Fig . 6c , d ) .
