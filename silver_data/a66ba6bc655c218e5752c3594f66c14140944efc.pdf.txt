In eukaryotic cells , MVBs are formed after invagination of the limiting membrane of the sorting endosome , delivering transmembrane proteins and lipids to the lumen . Enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus hijack the MVB pathway in order to escape from cells 5 , 6 . Cargo sorting into MVB is a highly regulated process and it has been shown that monoubiquitination of transmembrane proteins serve as a signal for sorting into the MVB pathway 7 , 8 . The vesicle formation and cargo sorting depends on a group of at least 20 proteins first identified in Baker’s yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and known as class E Vacuolar Protein Sorting ( vps ) proteins 9 , 10 . ( The vacuole is the yeast counterpart of the lysosome ) . These vps proteins are highly conserved from yeast to humans with only the addition of a few more homologs in humans indicating a more regulated MVB sorting pathway . The majority of the class E vps proteins can be grouped in three separate heteromeric subcomplexes termed ESCRT - I , ESCRT - II and ESCRT - III ( Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport ) . During MVB sorting , HRS - vps27 is first recruited to the early endosome by virtue of its FYVE domain interaction with PI ( 3 ) P and its UIM ( ubiquitin interacting motif ) interaction with ubiquitinated cargo . It then recruits the ESCRT - I complex ( composed of vps23 , vps28 and vps37 ) to the membrane . ESCRT - I recruits the downstream ESCRT - II and ESCRT - III complexes 11 . After the ESCRTs have been recruited to the endosome membrane , the AAA - type ATPase vps4 binds ESCRT - III and following MVB vesicle formation catalyses the dissociation of ESCRT protein complexes in an ATP - dependent manner for further rounds of protein sorting 12 . Together , the ESCRT complexes , vps4 , and related proteins form a complex membrane - associated network . Our laboratories have the long term goal of carrying out a complete three dimensional structural and functional characterization of this network . Using x - ray diffraction data collected at APS and SSRL beam line 9 - 2 we have determined the first structure of an ESCRT complex . Here we report the 3 . 6 Å resolution structure of the quaternary ESCRT - II complex containing vps22 , vps36 and two vps25 molecules . The complex adopts the shape of a capital letter ‘Y’ ( figure 1 ) , with overall dimensions of 120 × 85 × 52 Å . The base of the ‘Y’ consists of one of the two molecules of vps25 ; one of the branches of the ‘Y’ consists of the second molecule of vps25 , and the other branch is formed by a subcomplex consisting of vps22 and the C - terminal domain of vps36 . The N terminus of vps22 is a single α - helix that protrudes away from the tip of the ‘Y’ shape . None of the three ESCRT - II subunits has discernable homology between each other at the amino acid sequence level . However all three have in common a structure based on two copies of the winged - helix ( WH ) fold . Figure 1 . Overall structure of the ESCRT - II complex : vps22 is blue , vps36 red and vps25 green . The vps22 - vps36 interaction is the most extensive in the complex burying a total of 2 , 527 Å 2 of solvent - accessible surface area from both partners . The vps22 - vps25 interaction buries a total of 1 , 689 Å 2 of solvent - accessible surface . The focal point of the vps25 binding site on vps22 is an aromatic cage made up of the side chains of Trp 212 , Trp 224 and Trp 228 . Pro 226 and Ile 229 also contribute to the walls of the cage . Together these residues completely surround and bury Phe 10 of vps25 . In addition to hydrophobic interactions , a salt bridge is formed by the side chains of Asp 214 ( vps22 ) and Arg 83 ( vps25 ) . The parallels between vps36 - vps25 and vps22 - vps25 interactions are striking ( figure 2 ) . Phe 10 of vps25 is buried in an aromatic cage on vps36 . The cage is formed by Leu 546 , Tyr 557 , Tyr 561 and Trp 562 . Also a salt bridge is formed between Arg 83 ( vps25 ) and Asp 584 ( vps36 ) . The total surface area buried is 1 , 524 Å 2 . The mutation F10D at the heart of the vps25 interface with vps22 or vps36 , or mutation R83D , with removes salt bridges with vps22 Asp 214 and vps36 Asp 548 , leads in both cases to a class E phenotype and a monomer vps25 . The salt bridge can be rescued by a charge reversal mutation recovering the stoichiometry and functionality of the complex . The structure shows how ESCRT - II subunits assemble to form a scaffold to coordinate multiple interactions with proteins . As the first structure of ESCRT complex it is an exciting step forward . By the same token , much work remains to achieve the ultimate goal of a three dimensional mechanistic understanding at of the entire MVB protein network .
