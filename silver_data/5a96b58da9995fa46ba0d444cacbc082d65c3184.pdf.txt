J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Abstract ( word count : 247 / 250 ) Objective To assess the household secondary infection risk ( SIR ) of B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha ) and non - Alpha lineages of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) among children . Study design During January – April 2021 , we prospectively followed households with a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . We collected questionnaires , serial nasopharyngeal swabs for RT - PCR testing and whole genome sequencing , and serial blood samples for serology testing . We calculated SIRs by primary case age ( pediatric vs . adult ) , household contact age , and viral lineage . We evaluated risk factors associated with transmission and described symptom profiles among children . Results Among 36 households with pediatric primary cases , 21 ( 58 % ) had secondary infections . Among 91 households with adult primary cases , 51 ( 56 % ) had secondary infections . SIRs among pediatric and adult primary cases were 45 % and 54 % , respectively ( OR : 0 . 79 [ 95 % CI 0 . 41 – 1 . 54 ] ) . SIRs among pediatric primary cases with Alpha and non - Alpha lineage were 55 % and 46 % , respectively ( OR : 1 . 52 [ CI 0 . 51 – 4 . 53 ] ) . SIRs among pediatric and adult household contacts were 55 % and 49 % , respectively ( OR : 1 . 01 [ CI 0 . 68 – 1 . 50 ] ) . Among pediatric contacts , no significant differences in odds of acquiring infection by demographic or household characteristics were observed . Conclusions Household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from children and adult primary cases to household members was frequent . Risk of secondary infection was similar among child and adult household contacts . Among children , household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and risk of secondary infection was not influenced by lineage . Continued mitigation strategies ( e . g . , J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 masking , physical distancing , vaccination ) are needed to protect at - risk groups regardless of virus lineage circulating in communities .

Several variants of concern ( VOCs ) have emerged during the pandemic , which have affected SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , susceptibility , and disease severity . 7 , 8 The SARS - CoV - 2 B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha ) lineage was first identified in the United Kingdom in September 2020 and J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 emerged in the United States in December 2020 , 9 becoming the predominant variant within four months . 7 From December 2020 – September 2021 , the Alpha variant was classified as a VOC in the United States . Prior studies have indicated that the Alpha variant was more efficiently transmitted compared with previous lineages . 10 , 11 We conducted a household transmission investigation pre - B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Delta ) and pre - B . 1 . 1 . 529 ( Omicron ) variant emergence , during the months of January – April 2021 when Alpha was the most prevalent lineage in the United States . Using detailed epidemiological data and multiple testing modalities , we estimate household secondary infection risks ( SIRs ) , describe characteristics associated with transmission and infection , and compare symptom profiles of children infected with Alpha and non - Alpha SARS - CoV - 2 lineages in household settings . Methods Household Enrollment During January – April 2021 , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) was invited to collaborate with state and local health departments in San Diego County , California and metropolitan Denver ( Adam , Arapahoe , and Douglas counties ) , Colorado to conduct household transmission investigations . 12 Public health agencies reported persons in households with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) specimen to CDC’s investigation team to be screened for enrollment eligibility . 12 Households were eligible if the primary case was not hospitalized at enrollment , lived with ≥1 person , did not live in a congregate setting , and had illness onset ≤10 days prior to enrollment ( Figure 1 ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . Household Case Classifications and Definitions J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 The primary case was defined as the person within the household with the earliest illness onset date . Illness onset date was defined as symptom onset date , or , if asymptomatic , collection date of initial SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR – positive specimen . Household contacts were household members spending ≥1 night in the household during the infectious period of the primary case , defined as two days before through ten days after the illness onset date . 13 Households were excluded if all household members were lost to follow - up , withdrew during the 14 - day follow - up , or if the primary case could not be determined because multiple persons in a household became symptomatic or tested positive on the same day ( i . e . , co - primary infections ) . Primary and secondary case classifications were retroactively assigned following the evaluation . Secondary cases were defined as household contacts who had a positive RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 during the investigation period , converted from SARS - CoV - 2 IgG negative on enrollment to SARS - CoV - 2 IgG positive on closeout without a history of vaccination , or were seropositive on enrollment with new - onset symptoms without a history of vaccination or a previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Pediatric household members ( aged < 18 years ) were classified as young children ( ≤11 years ) or adolescents ( 12 – 17 years ) . Household Visits An in - person visit was conducted at enrollment ( Day 0 ) and closeout ( Day 14 ) . Questionnaires capturing demographic characteristics , medical histories , recent symptoms , previous SARS - CoV - 2 testing , and preventive behaviors were administered to all household members at enrollment and closeout . For young children , a parent or guardian assisted them in completing the questionnaire . A household - level questionnaire captured physical characteristics of the residence ( e . g . , square footage , number of bedrooms and bathrooms ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 Blood for serology and nasopharyngeal ( NP ) swabs for RT - PCR were collected from household members on enrollment and closeout . Household members self - completed daily symptom diaries using a standardized form with yes / no responses . At enrollment , some households were offered daily home antigen testing by QuickVue® At - Home OTC COVID - 19 Test ( Quidel ; San Diego , CA ) . Household members were asked to perform an antigen test each day , regardless of symptom status . Antigen test results were submitted daily to the investigation team . During the 14 - day follow - up period , if a household contact developed new or worsening symptoms , or newly tested positive by home antigen testing , an interim visit was conducted to collect a NP swab for RT - PCR from all household members . A parent or guardian used discretion to determine if children needed assistance with daily antigen testing and symptom diaries during the 14 - day follow - up . Vaccination Status and Symptom Categorization Individuals were considered fully vaccinated ≥14 days after completion of all recommended doses of an FDA - authorized COVID - 19 vaccine ( the primary series ) , partially vaccinated if < 14 days since completing the primary series or did not complete the series , and unvaccinated if no COVID - 19 vaccine was received . 14 Date and type of SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination was verified through direct observation of vaccination cards when available . Symptoms were categorized as constitutional ( measured or subjective fever , chills , myalgia , and fatigue ) , upper respiratory ( runny nose , nasal congestion , and sore throat ) , lower respiratory ( cough , difficulty breathing , shortness of breath , wheezing , and chest pain ) , neurologic ( headache , loss of taste , and loss of smell ) , and gastrointestinal ( nausea and / or vomiting , diarrhea , and abdominal pain ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 Laboratory Testing San Diego County Public Health Laboratories performed RT - PCR testing of NP swabs for SARS - CoV - 2 using the Perkin Elmer New Coronavirus Nucleic Acid Detection Kit and Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment ( CDPHE ) Laboratory used the TaqPath™ COVID - 19 Combo Kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) was conducted on at least one NP specimen from participants with a RT - PCR cycle threshold ( Ct ) value < 35 ( see Appendix for Supplemental Methods ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . Serum was separated from whole blood samples and stored at - 70°C until tested for presence of SARS - CoV - 2 specific antibodies using the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG Reagent Pack ( Ortho - Clinical Diagnostics ; Rochester , NY ) , xMAP® SARS - CoV - 2 Multi - Antigen IgG Assay ( Luminex ) , or Alinity i SARS - CoV - 2 IgG assay ( Abbott ) . The Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages ( PANGOLIN ) was used to assign SARS - CoV - 2 lineages to sequenced genomes . 15 A lineage was assigned to each household as determined by the lineage of a representative sequence obtained from the primary case or sequenced household member if sequencing results were unavailable for the primary case . VOCs were defined based on the CDC variant classification scheme at the time the evaluation occured . 8 Analysis Demographic characteristics of pediatric household members were described by case classification ( i . e . , primary case , secondary case , or uninfected household contact ) and lineage ( Alpha or non - Alpha lineages ) . Unadjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were estimated using generalized estimating equations ( GEEs ) to compare frequencies of J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 symptoms between pediatric and adult cases , and among pediatric cases by lineage . GEEs with an exchangeable correlation matrix were used to account for household clustering . 4 Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare symptom duration between pediatric and adult cases , and among pediatric cases by lineage . Those who remained symptomatic at closeout were treated as if their symptoms had resolved on Day 14 . SIRs were calculated as the proportion of secondary cases among all non - excluded household contacts . Contacts were excluded from SIR calculations and risk factor analyses if they were fully vaccinated or had a previously documented SARS - CoV - 2 infection . SIRs were estimated 1 ) by age and lineage ( Alpha versus non - Alpha ) of the primary case and 2 ) by age and lineage of household contacts . ORs and 95 % CIs were calculated using GEEs to compare SIRs in each primary and household contact age group and lineage group . Among pediatric household contacts , unadjusted ORs and 95 % CIs were estimated using GEEs to assess risk factors for infection . Within the GEE framework , type III tests were used to assess differences in percent positivity among age groups and lineage ; p - values were based on the limiting chi - square distributions . Using Fishers exact tests , amino acid polymorphisms in the S - gene were screened for associations between the age of the primary case ( pediatric or adult ) and SIR ( ≥50 % or < 50 % ) , evaluating each site at which two different amino acids were observed in ≥5 of the household representative sequences . P - values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . All analyses were performed using SAS 9 . 4 ( SAS Institute Inc . , Cary , NC ) ; figures were prepared using Microsoft Excel and R version 4 . 0 . 4 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . Ethical Considerations J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy . 16 – 20 All household members provided written consent , child assent with parental permission , or parent permission before participation . Results Study Population and Characteristics Individuals from 151 households were enrolled ; 24 households were excluded during analysis ( Figure 1 ) . After exclusion , 127 households with a single primary case and 316 household contacts were available for analysis . The median time interval from primary case illness onset to enrollment was six days ( range : 2 – 10 ) . Pediatric household members represented 28 % ( 36 / 127 ) of primary cases and 36 % ( 115 / 316 ) of household contacts . Of 151 pediatric household members ( including cases and household contacts ) , 73 ( 48 % ) were young children and 78 ( 52 % ) were adolescents ( Table I ) . The median age of pediatric household members was 12 years ( interquartile range [ IQR ] : 7 – 15 ) . Underlying medical conditions were uncommon ; the most frequently reported condition was chronic lung disease ( 13 % ) . No pediatric cases were hospitalized , and none died . Most ( 147 / 151 , 97 % ) pediatric household members were unvaccinated ; four ( 3 % ) ( two primary and two secondary cases ) were partially vaccinated . Alpha was the most common SARS - CoV - 2 lineage identified in pediatric primary cases ( n = 21 , 58 % ) and secondary cases ( n = 39 , 64 % ) . Demographic and clinical characteristics among pediatric cases with Alpha and non - Alpha lineages are displayed in Table II ( available at www . jpeds . com ) . Four pediatric household contacts were seropositive at enrollment or reported prior SARS - CoV - 2 infection and were excluded from RT - PCR positivity , SIR , and risk factor J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 analyses . Among the 36 pediatric primary cases and 111 non - excluded pediatric household contacts , 96 ( 65 % ) had a SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR – positive specimen collected during the evaluation ( Table III ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . One pediatric case with Alpha lineage never tested positive by RT - PCR but was classified as a case based on Day 0 seropositivity and new - onset of symptoms without a history of infection or vaccination . RT - PCR - positivity did not differ significantly by age ; among pediatric cases , positivity did not differ significantly by lineage . Overall , 75 % ( 105 / 140 ) of pediatric and 76 % ( 172 / 227 ) of adult household members participated in daily antigen testing . Blood specimens for serological assessment were not available for 56 pediatric and 17 adult household members . Symptoms Among Pediatric Household Members Among the 96 RT - PCR – positive pediatric cases , 26 ( 27 % ) were asymptomatic at the time of first positive test ( data not shown ) . Ten of 96 ( 10 % ) pediatric cases remained asymptomatic throughout the 14 - day follow - up period , whereas seven of 164 ( 4 % ) adult cases remained asymptomatic . Among the 97 total pediatric cases , 87 ( 90 % ) reported at least one symptom during the evaluation ( Figure 2 ) . Upper respiratory ( 79 % ) and constitutional ( 70 % ) symptoms were the most common . The most reported individual symptoms were rhinorrhea / nasal congestion ( 72 % ) , cough ( 61 % ) , and headache ( 55 % ) . When comparing pediatric and adult cases , pediatric cases had lower frequencies of reporting most symptoms ( Figure 2 ) . Pediatric cases were significantly less likely than adult cases to report constitutional ( OR : 0 . 31 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 15 – 0 . 65 ) , lower respiratory ( OR : 0 . 40 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 22 – 0 . 75 ) , gastrointestinal ( OR : 0 . 54 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 31 – 0 . 93 ) , and neurological symptoms ( OR : J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 0 . 10 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 04 – 0 . 25 ) . The median symptom duration among pediatric cases was 3 days ( IQR : 2 – 5 days ) , which did not differ significantly from the median among adults ( 4 days , IQR : 2 – 7 days ) ( P = 0 . 6 ) . Frequencies of reporting any symptoms during this study were similar among pediatric cases with Alpha ( 87 % ) and non - Alpha ( 94 % ) lineages ( OR : 0 . 44 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 09 – 2 . 21 ) ( Figure 3 ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . Pediatric cases with Alpha lineage were significantly more likely than cases with non - Alpha lineages to report constitutional ( OR : 5 . 5 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 55 – 19 . 20 ) , lower respiratory ( OR : 3 . 52 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 26 – 9 . 86 ) , and gastrointestinal ( OR : 3 . 55 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 16 – 10 . 89 ) symptoms . Pediatric cases with Alpha lineage experienced a similar duration of symptoms compared with non - Alpha lineages ( median : 3 versus 2 days , respectively ; P = 0 . 64 ) . Secondary Infections Risks Among 36 households with pediatric primary cases , 21 ( 58 % ) had > 1 secondary case . Among 91 households with adult primary cases , 51 ( 56 % ) had ≥1 secondary case . SIRs for household contacts of pediatric and adult primary cases were 45 % and 54 % , respectively ( OR : 0 . 79 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 41 – 1 . 54 ) ( Figure 4 and Table IV ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . SIRs for household contacts of pediatric primary cases with Alpha and non - Alpha lineages were 55 % and 46 % , respectively ( OR : 1 . 52 95 % CI , 0 . 51 – 4 . 53 ) . SIRs for household contacts of young child and adolescent primary cases were 46 % and 43 % , respectively ( OR : 1 . 02 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 35 – 3 . 0 ) ( Figure 5 ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . Among the 111 non - excluded pediatric contacts , 61 ( 55 % ) tested RT - PCR – positive or seroconverted during the 14 - day follow - up . SIRs for pediatric and adult household contacts were 55 % and 49 % , respectively ( OR : 1 . 01 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 68 – 1 . 50 ) ( Figure 6 and Table IV ) . SIRs for J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 pediatric contacts in households with Alpha and non - Alpha lineages were 64 % and 56 % , respectively ( OR : 1 . 08 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 40 – 2 . 98 ) . SIRs for young child and adolescent household contacts were 60 % and 50 % , respectively ( OR : 1 . 09 95 % CI , 0 . 60 – 1 . 97 ) ( Figure 7 ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . Inclusion of household contacts who were fully vaccinated or had a previously documented SARS - CoV - 2 infection in SIR calculations did not result in significantly different SIRs than when these individuals were excluded ( data not shown ) . Risk Factors for Infection Among Pediatric Contacts There were no significant differences in the odds of acquiring infection among pediatric contacts by age , sex , race / ethnicity , underlying medical conditions , relationship to primary case , school or daycare attendance , number of household members , sharing of bedrooms and bathrooms , having direct or indirect contact with the primary case , maintaining physical distance ( ≥6 feet ) with the primary case , or genomic lineage ( Table V ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . Genomic Analysis Sequence data were obtained for specimens from 212 household members from 104 households . Genetic analyses of RT - PCR – positive specimens showed no evidence of multiple introductions into households . Among the 59 households where SARS - CoV - 2 sequences were recovered from multiple participants , lineages always matched , with sequences varying by 0 – 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 57 households and by 4 and 5 SNPs , respectively , in the remaining two households . No genetic association was detected with SIR differences between households or primary case age , based on the phylogeny of household representative sequences or with any of 13 S - gene amino acid polymorphisms from the same sequences ( Figure 8 ; available at www . jpeds . com ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 Discussion We present an analyses of SARS - CoV - 2 household transmission among children immediately prior to the Delta wave of the pandemic when the Alpha variant was the most prominent lineage in the United States . Household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from child and adult primary cases to household members was frequent . We found similar SIRs among child and adult primary cases , contrary to prior household transmission investigations reporting SARS - CoV - 2 transmission from adults at higher proportions than children 21 – 24 . Similarly , we found similar SIRs among young children and adolescent primary cases , despite prior studies reporting age - related differences in transmissibility 11 , 25 , 26 . These findings could be explained by our universal testing independent of symptoms , allowing for comprehensive secondary case ascertainment among household contacts . Our ability to identify primary cases early in the acute phase of infection when they were likely most transmissible 27 , 28 may have increased the robustness of our SIR estimates . We also found that pediatric household contacts were as likely as adult contacts to become infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . There is conflicting literature regarding how SARS - CoV - 2 susceptibility among children compares with adults . Some studies have reported that children and adults acquired SARS - CoV - 2 infection at similar proportions , 4 – 6 and others have reported that children had lower susceptibility compared with adults . 29 – 31 Elucidating pediatric susceptibility is complicated , as transmission rates can be influenced by differences in behavior , exposure , and testing practice ( i . e . , preferential testing of symptomatic individuals ) , which could lead to an underestimation of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in children , who are less likely than adults to have symptoms when infected . Daily antigen testing likely facilitated early identification of secondary cases and may have allowed us to identify more infections among asymptomatic J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 household members compared with previous studies . the absolute proportion of symptomatic children in this investigation was higher than reported in previous studies . 32 , 33 This finding could be attributed to differences in reporting symptoms daily , as was done in this investigation , compared with reporting symptoms retrospectively , which may underestimate the proportion of symptomatic children . Although surveillance and modeling suggested that Alpha had increased transmissibility in community settings compared with non - Alpha lineages circulating at that time , 10 , 11 in this investigation , household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and risk of subsequent infection among children were not influenced by lineage . These findings suggest the substantial transmission that can occur within households due to shared living spaces regardless of genomic lineage . At the time of investigation and analysis , many children were not eligible to receive COVID - 19 vaccination , which underscores the importance of continued mitigation strategies ( e . g . , masking , physical distancing ) to protect children regardless of virus lineage circulating in the community . 34 – 39 Increases in pediatric cases , emergency department visits , and hospitalizations in the United States , especially in situations where vaccinations among pediatric age groups are limited and in the context of emerging VOCs , such as Delta and Omicron , also highlight the importance of continued mitigation measures to protect this at - risk population . 1 , 39 Further exploration of the relationship between household transmission and other emerging , highly transmissible lineages is warranted to aid in appropriate public health messaging and interventions to curb transmission . 40 This analysis is subject to several limitations . First , behavior of enrolled household members might not be reflective of behavior in the general population ; those who enrolled might be more conscious of mitigating practices , which could have influenced transmission probability J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 in this investigation . Similarly , exposures and transmission within households may differ from community transmission . Second , our sample size may have limited our ability to detect meaningful differences , especially regarding age strata within our pediatric population . We were unable to collect blood specimens from all pediatric household members , which may have influenced our ability to detect prior infection . This may have also affected our ability to identify pediatric household members who seroconverted during the investigation . Additionally , some pediatric infections may have been missed due to seroconversion after the investigation concluded . Therefore , the true infection proportion among children may have been higher than reported . Although we attributed all illnesses to SARS - CoV - 2 infection , it is possible that individuals who were only serologically positive with newly developed symptoms could have been ill from another respiratory pathogen . Finally , though our analysis attributes all transmission within households to primary cases , even with the viral genetic data , we cannot completely rule - out the possibility of tertiary transmission events ( i . e . , subsequent contact - to - contact transmission events within a household ) . This could bias SIR estimates and therefore limit analysis of primary case and contact characteristics associated with transmission . Transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from child and adult primary cases to other household members was frequent . Children were as likely as adults to acquire SARS - CoV - 2 infection in household settings . Household transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and risk of subsequent infection among children were not influenced by lineage , suggesting the substantial transmission that can occur within households due to shared living spaces regardless of genomic lineage . Symptom profiles were different among children with Alpha and non - Alpha lineages , and between children and adults . These findings highlight the continued importance of mitigation measures to reduce SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in households with at - risk groups . Although the Alpha variant is no J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 longer a prominent circulating lineage , given the still limited information around SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and susceptibility in children , this investigation adds to the growing literature providing understanding on the impact of current and emerging SARS - CoV - 2 lineages among pediatric populations .

ORs were used to compare SIRs . e The probability of transmission among household contacts was compared by age of the primary case ( pediatric versus adult ) . For pediatric primary cases , the probability of transmission among household contacts was compared by age of the pediatric primary case ( young child [ ≤11 years ] versus adolescent [ 12 – 17 years ] ) and by lineage group ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 [ Alpha ] versus non - Alpha ) . Specimens from five primary pediatric cases did not undergo sequencing and therefore a lineage was not assigned to these individuals . f The probability of infection among household contacts was compared by age of the household contact ( pediatric versus adult ) . For pediatric household contacts , the probability of infection was compared by age of the pediatric household contact ( young child [ ≤11 years ] versus adolescent [ 12 – 17 years ] ) and by lineage group ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 [ Alpha ] versus non - Alpha ) .
