WASP - mediated activa - tion of Arp2 / 3 complex requires a preformed actin ﬁlament , ensuring that activation by WASP creates branched instead of linear ﬁlaments . However , this biochemical requirement also means that assembly of branched actin networks must be primed with an initial seed ﬁlament [ 2 – 4 ] . We recently described a class of activators called WISH / DIP / SPIN90 ( WDS ) proteins , which , unlike WASP , activate Arp2 / 3 com - plex without a preformed ﬁlament [ 4 ] . Although this property may allow WDS proteins to serve as seed ﬁlament generators , it is unknown whether actin ﬁla - ments nucleated by WDS - activated Arp2 / 3 complex can activate WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . Further , despite their potential importance as branched actin network initiators , little is known about how WDS proteins turn on Arp2 / 3 complex . Here , we use two - color single - molecule total internal reﬂection ﬂuores - cence ( TIRF ) microscopy to show that Dip1 , the S . pombe WDS protein [ 5 ] , co - opts features of branching nucleation to activate Arp2 / 3 complex . Speciﬁcally , it activates Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate linear ﬁlaments analogous to the branch created by WASP - mediated activation . The barbed ends of Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 nucleated ﬁlaments are free to elongate , and their pointed ends remain anchored to Dip1 - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . The linear ﬁlaments nucle - ated by Dip1 - bound Arp2 / 3 complex activate WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex as potently as sponta - neously nucleated or branched actin ﬁlaments . These observations provide important insights into the regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex by its activators and the molecular basis for initiation of branched actin networks . RESULTS Dip1 Co - opts Features of Branching Nucleation to Create Linear Filaments Unlike Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , WISH / DIP / SPIN90 ( WDS ) proteins activate Arp2 / 3 complex without pre - formed actin ﬁlaments , suggesting they trigger nucleation using a mechanism different from WASP [ 4 ] . Several other observa - tions support this hypothesis . For instance , WDS proteins lack the canonical Arp2 / 3 complex interacting region of WASP , the CA ( central , acidic ) segment , and instead use a C - terminal arma - dillo repeat motif domain to bind and activate Arp2 / 3 complex [ 4 , 6 ] . In addition , WASP uses its conserved V region to recruit monomers directly to Arp2 / 3 complex for activation [ 7 , 8 ] , but WDS proteins lack V regions and do not bind to actin monomers [ 4 ] . Finally , WASP and WDS proteins bind to different sites on Arp2 / 3 complex [ 6 , 9 – 13 ] . However , despite these differences , some experiments indicate potentially overlapping activation mechanisms for these two nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) . For instance , both WDS and WASP family proteins stim - ulate movement of Arp2 and Arp3 into or near a short pitch dimer ( ﬁlament - like ) arrangement , a conformational change required for activation [ 4 , 14 – 17 ] . How WDS proteins use a set of molec - ular features both common to and distinct from WASP to switch on Arp2 / 3 complex is currently unclear and is critical to under - standing this class of actin regulators . During WASP - mediated activation of Arp2 / 3 complex , the nucleated ﬁlament ( daughter ﬁlament ) elongates from the barbed ends of Arp2 and Arp3 , and the pointed end of the Arps bind to thesidesofapre - existing ( mother ) ﬁlament ( Figure1A ) [ 18 ] . There - fore , we reasoned that , like WASP , Dip1 could activate Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate ﬁlaments that remain anchored by their pointed ends to the complex , with their barbed ends free to elon - gate ( Figure 1A ) . In this mechanism , linear ﬁlaments generated by Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 complex are analogous to branches generated by WASP - activated Arp2 / 3 complex . To test this model , we ﬂuores - cently labeled Dip1 with Alexa Fluor 568 to visualize its inﬂuence on actin polymerization in single - molecule total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy assays . Dip1 labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 on an engineered N - terminal cysteine ( 568 - Dip1 ) showeddecreasedactivitycomparedtounlabeledDip1butsignif - icantly accelerated actin assembly in the presence of Arp2 / 3 3886 Current Biology 28 , 3886 – 3891 , December 3 , 2018 ª 2018 Elsevier Ltd . complex , indicating the labeled protein retained activity ( Fig - ure 1B ) . Dip1 at multiple concentrations sedimented as a single peak by analytical ultracentrifugation and lysine biotinylated 568 - Dip1 bound to coverslips photobleached predominantly in single steps ( Figures 1C – 1F ; Table S1 ) . Together , these data suggest Dip1 is a monomer at low and high concentrations and 568 - Dip1 is suitable for simple single - molecule imaging . In actin polymerization reactions containing ( non - biotinylated ) 568 - Dip1 , Oregon Green actin , and unlabeled Arp2 / 3 complex , we observed Dip1 molecules bound to one end of actin ﬁlaments that adhered to the imaging surface ( Figure 2A ) . The free ends of Dip1 - bound ﬁlaments elongated at the rate expected for free barbed ends [ 19 ] , indicating Dip1 molecules bind the pointed end ( Figure 2B ) . Dip1 only bound to ﬁlament ends in reactions containing Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2C ) . Therefore , we conclude that Dip1 binds actin ﬁlament pointed ends indirectly through Arp2 / 3 complex . Together , these data demonstrate that the linear actin ﬁlament generated by Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 com - plex is analogous to the branch created by WASP - mediated activation . Three distinct classes of events produced actin ﬁlaments with Dip1 bound at their pointed ends ( Figures 2A and 2D ) . In class I Dip1 ﬁlament binding events ( 31 out of 141 observations ) , Dip1 non - speciﬁcally adsorbed to the surface and an actin ﬁlament ap - peared to nucleate from the Dip1 punctum ( Figures 2A and 2D ; Video S1 ) . Although we cannot eliminate the possibility that these events represent capture of a spontaneously nucleated actin ﬁla - ment by surface - adsorbed Dip1 , our observations argue against this interpretation ( see below ) . Therefore , we interpret these events as Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation of linear ﬁlaments . In a second , more frequent class of events ( class II ; 108 of 141 ) , actin ﬁlaments ‘‘pre - loaded’’ with Dip1 were observed when they landed on the imaging surface ( Figures 2A and 2D ; Video S2 ) . These events could represent surface capture of ﬁlaments that were nucleated by Dip1 and Arp2 / 3 complex in the reaction chamber above the zone of TIRF illumination . Alternatively , they might be spontaneously nucleated actin ﬁlaments that bound Dip1 and Arp2 / 3 complex at their pointed ends before landing on the imaging surface . Two observations argue against the latter explanation . First , association of Dip1 and Arp2 / 3 complex with pre - existing pointed ends is rare , as we observed very few in - stances in which Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 bound to free pointed ends of surface - captured ﬁlaments ( class III events ; 2 out of 141 events ; Figures 2A and 2D ; Video S3 ) .

Dip1rarelybound pointedendsofspontaneously nucle - atedandArp2 / 3 - cappedshearedﬁlaments ( < 1 % ofpointedends ; Figure 2E ) but was frequently observed ( 33 % of pointed ends ) bound in reactions in which the Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 complex assembly nucleated linear ﬁlaments ( Figure 2F ) . Therefore , our data show that Dip1 associates strongly with Arp2 / 3 complex on a ﬁlament pointed end only if it has cooperated with the complex to nucleate that ﬁlament . Actin Filaments Nucleated by Dip1 and Arp2 / 3 Complex Activate WASP - Bound Arp2 / 3 Complex Dip1 possesses a key biochemical property that could allow it to seed branched actin network assembly : it activates Arp2 / 3 com - plex without requiring a preformed ﬁlament [ 4 ] . In cells , deletion of Dip1 stalls WASP ( called Wsp1 in S . pombe ) at endocytic sites and decreases the rate at which new endocytic actin networks are initiated , leading to a signiﬁcant decrease in the total number of cortical actin puncta [ 5 ] . Together , these observations led us to propose that actin ﬁlaments nucleated by Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex might stimulate WASP - mediated activation of the complex to initiate branched network assembly . However , it is not clear whether ﬁlaments nucleated by Dip1 - bound Arp2 / 3 complex can trigger WASP - mediated activation . Impor - tantly , several recent studies show that the mode by which an actin ﬁlament is nucleated can strongly inﬂuence its interactions with other actin regulators .

Likewise , actin ﬁlaments nucle - ated by WASP - activated Arp2 / 3 complex are preferentially excluded from interactions with tropomyosin [ 21 ] . These and other experiments suggest the identity of protein ( s ) bound to the ﬁlament end may inﬂuence the conformation of interior actin ﬁlament subunits [ 22 ] . Although the precise mechanism of Dip1 - mediated activation of the complex is still unclear , a similar allosteric mechanism could inﬂuence the ability of Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 - complex - nucleated ﬁlaments to activate WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . Therefore , it is important to directly test whether ﬁla - ments generated by Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex can seed branched actin network initiation . The experiments we describe above demonstrate that 568 - Dip1 molecules mark actin ﬁlaments nucleated by Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2A ) , allowing us to distinguish them from spon - taneously nucleated ﬁlaments . Therefore , our single - molecule TIRF experiments provide an opportunity to directly test whether linear ﬁlaments nucleated by Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex can activate WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . In an assay contain - ing Arp2 / 3 complex , 568 - Dip1 , Oregon Green 488 actin , and the Arp2 / 3 complex - activating fragment of Wsp1 , Wsp1 - VCA , we observed multiple events in which new actin ﬁlaments appeared to nucleate from 568 - Dip1 puncta non - speciﬁcally adsorbed to the surface ( Figure 3A ) . As these linear ﬁlaments elongated , we frequently observed branched ﬁlaments growing from their sides ( Figure 3A ) . We also observed branches growing from Dip1 - bound ﬁlaments that landed on the imaging surface after nucleation ( Figure 3B ; Video S4 ) . Together , these experiments demonstrate that linear ﬁlaments nucleated and bound by Dip1 and Arp2 / 3 complex stimulate branching nucleation by WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . Under the conditions of these reactions , we observed branching nucleation not only from Dip1 - bound ﬁl - aments but also from free unbound ﬁlaments and from pre - exist - ing branches ( Figures 3A – 3C ; Video S5 ) . Therefore , we asked whether each source of ﬁlaments is equally potent in activating WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . We found that branches nucle - ated at the same rate from all three ﬁlament sources ( Figure 3D ) . DISCUSSION Our data show that the actin ﬁlament nucleated by Dip1 and Arp2 / 3 complex is analogous to the branched ﬁlament created by WASP - mediated activation of the complex ( Figure 1A ) . That Dip1 co - opts features of branching nucleation has implications for understanding multiple aspects of Arp2 / 3 complex function . For instance , because Arp2 / 3 complex stays anchored on pointed ends during and after Dip1 - mediated activation in this mechanism , the pointed ends of ﬁlaments nucleated by Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 complex are protected from depolymerization . Therefore , speciﬁc mechanisms may be required to stimulate dissociation of Arp2 / 3 complex from the pointed ends of ﬁlaments nucleated by Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex .

Current Biology 28 , 3886 – 3891 , December 3 , 2018 3889 have a role in dissociating Arp2 / 3 complex from the ends of linear ﬁlaments nucleated by Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex . Multiple NPFs or putative NPFs are present at endocytic sites in S . pombe , including Myo1 , Wsp1 , Dip1 , and Pan1 [ 5 , 26 , 27 ] . Although few experiments address how NPFs coordinately regu - late the complex , our results here , together with previous work [ 4 ] , show that Wsp1 and Dip1 use distinct mechanisms to acti - vate a common mode of nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex . If these mechanisms can work in concert , these two classes of NPFs could synergistically activate the complex , potentially inﬂu - encing the rates of network seeding and / or propagation of branching . Quantitative biochemical studies of the inﬂuence of coordinated regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex by these two NPFs will be important to understand the kinetics of branched actin initiation and propagation in cells . Here , we demonstrate that actin ﬁlaments nucleated by Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex stimulate branching nucleation by WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex to seed assembly of branched actin networks . Several lines of evidence suggest this seeding function of WDS proteins is broadly conserved . First , diverse WDS proteins activate the complex with similar biochemical properties and share a conserved Arp2 / 3 - complex - activating domain [ 4 , 6 ] . We anticipate that seeds generated by any WDS family protein will activate WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complexes , as we observed here for Dip1 . Second , previous studies suggest other WDS family proteins are important for actin assembly and may be involved in initiation of branched actin ﬁlament net - works . For instance , deletion of the budding yeast homolog of Dip1 , Ldb17 , causes endocytosis defects , decreasing the num - ber of endocytic actin patches and increasing their size [ 28 ] . This phenotype is identical to the dip1 D phenotype in ﬁssion yeast [ 5 ] and is consistent with a model in which Ldb17 initiates new patches by providing preformed ﬁlaments to activate WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex . Less is known about the in vivo function of the mammalian WDS protein , SPIN90 , but experiments sug - gest that it interacts with endocytic proteins and contributes to uptake of at least one endocytic cargo , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) [ 29 ] . In addition to its roles in endocytosis , some studies suggest SPIN90 may play a role in assembly of actin in lamellipodia . Speciﬁcally , one group showed that knockdown of SPIN90 in COS - 7 cells prevents platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) - induced rufﬂing [ 30 ] . Whether SPIN90 provides seed ﬁl - aments to initiate branched actin assembly in lamellipodia is an important open question . In addition , it will be important to deter - mine the relative contributions of WDS proteins in seeding compared to other potential mechanisms , which include seeding by formin - nucleated ﬁlaments [ 31 ] , Arp2 / 3 - independent ﬁlament nucleation by NPF proteins [ 32 ] , and capture of ﬁlaments gener - ated by coﬁlin - mediated severing [ 33 ] .

All puncta within each ﬁeld of view were analyzed . No statistics were used in any of the analyses in Figure 1 . In Figure 2B , three ﬁlaments lengths were measured for each condition ( 568 - Dip1 bound versus non - bound ) from a single TIRF movie . Filaments were selected for measurement only if their growth was unobstructed by other ﬁlaments in the ﬁeld and they remained adhered to the surface . For the 568 - Dip1 bound ﬁlaments that were tracked , 568 - Dip1 remained bound to the end of the ﬁlament for the duration of measurement , which was greater than 400 s in all cases . In Figure 2C , 106 total ﬁlaments were counted in the absence of Arp2 / 3 and 242 were counted in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex . In both cases , counts were made from a total of four replicate movies . All ﬁl - aments in each selected frame of a movie were counted . In Figure 2D , 242 total ﬁlaments were counted from a total of four replicate movies to determine the percentage of each class of 568 - Dip1 binding events . All ﬁlaments in a selected frame of the movie were counted . The bars represent the average 568 - Dip1 binding percentage for each binding class from the four replicates with standard error for each class . In Figure 3D , to determine the branching density of the three sources of seed ﬁlaments , all the ﬁlaments in three replicate movies were measured and counted . The bars represent the average branching rate from the three replicates with standard error for each seed ﬁlament source . A two - tailed t test assuming unequal variances was used to determine if the branching rates were signiﬁcantly different . No other statistical methods , sample size estimations , strategies for randomization , stratiﬁcation , or blinding were used in the experiments or their analyses in this study . Protein Expression , Puriﬁcation , and Labeling To generate a Dip1 construct for site speciﬁc labeling with a cysteine reactive ﬂuorescent dye , the six endogenous cysteines were mutated to alanine by amplifying pGV67 - SpDip1 [ 4 ] with non - overlapping 5 0 - phosphoryated primers encoding the mutation . The N - terminal Not1 restriction site , used to generate the GST - TEV - Dip1 expression vector , codes for a cysteine that was exploited for labeling . For expression and labeling of mutant protein , BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) RIL E . coli transformed with the pGV67 Dip1 expression vector was grown in 5 mL of LB plus 100 m g / mL ampicillin and 35 m g / mL chloramphenicol overnight at 37 (cid:1) C . One milliliter of this culture was used to inoculate 50 mL of LB plus ampicillin and chloramphenicol that was grown until turbid at 37 (cid:1) C with shaking at 180 rpm . Ten milliliters of this culture were used to inoculate 1L of LB plus ampicillin and chloramphenicol . These cultures were grown to an O . D . 600 of 0 . 6 - 0 . 7 , induced with 0 . 4 mM isopropyl 1 - thio - b - D - galactopyranoside ( IPTG ) , and grown overnight at 22 (cid:1) C for 12 - 14 hours . To each 1L culture ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) and phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) were added to 2 mM and 0 . 5 mM , respectively . The cultures were pelleted at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes in the Fiberlite F8B rotor at 4 (cid:1) C . Cells were resuspended in 100 mL of lysis buffer ; 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 140 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , plus 2 protease inhibitor tablets ( Roche ) . The resuspended cells were lysed by sonication on ice with intermittent pulses to keep the temperature below 10 (cid:1) C . The lysate was clariﬁed by centrifugation in a JA - 20 rotor at 18 , 000 rpm for 30 minutes , and the soluble fraction was loaded on a 10mL glutathione Sepharose column equilibrated in GST - binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 140 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) . Protein was eluted with 30 mL of elution buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 140 mM NaCl and 50 mM glutathione adjusted to pH 8 . 0 ) . Peak fractions were pooled and TEV protease was added at a 25 : 1 ratio ( by mass ) . The reaction mix was dialyzed overnight at 4 (cid:1) C against 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol . The sample was loaded onto a 6 mL Resource Q column at pH 8 . 0 and eluted with a gradient of 50 mM to 500 mM NaCl . Protein was then concen - trated in an Amicon - Ultra concentration device before loading on a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16 / 60 gel ﬁltration column and eluting in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 and 50 mM NaCl . Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to (cid:3) 40 m M for labeling . A 10 mM solution of Alexa Fluor 568 C5 Maleimide was prepared by dissolving in DMSO according to manufacturer’s protocol . Protein was labeled by the dropwise addition of a 10 - 40 molar ratio of dye : protein while stirring at 4 (cid:1) C . After 12 - 16 hours , the reaction was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM dithiothreitol for 24 hours at 4 (cid:1) C with buffer exchanges after 4 hr and 8 hrs . Labeled protein sample was loaded on a 5mL Hi - Trap desalting column and peak fractions were pooled and ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen . The concentration of 568 - Dip1 and the percentage labeled were calculated by measuring the absorbance at 575 nm and 280 nm . The concentration of Alexa Fluor 568 was calculated using the extinction coefﬁcient , ε , 91 , 900 M - 1 cm - 1 . The concentration of Dip1 was calculated using Beer’s law with the following correction factor for contribution from Alexa Fluor 568 : [ Dip1 ] = ( Abs 280 – ( Abs 575 * 0 . 403 ) ) / ε , where , ε , the extinction coefﬁcient of Dip1 was estimated based on amino acid content at 36 , 330 M - 1 cm - 1 . Bio - tinylated 568 - Dip1 was prepared by incubating a 15 - fold molar excess of EZ - Link - NHS - PEG12 - biotin ( Thermoﬁsher ) for 9 hours in labeling buffer ( 20 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl ) at 4 (cid:1) C . The reaction was quenched by dialysis overnight in 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 and 50 mM NaCl . To prepare lysates for S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex puriﬁcation , 10 mL of a turbid culture of S . pombe ( TP150 strain ) cells was added to each 1L of YE5S in a 2 . 8 L ﬂask . These cultures were grown for (cid:3) 12 hr at 30 (cid:1) C with shaking . All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 (cid:1) C . EDTA and PMSF were added to 2mM and 0 . 5 mM , respectively , and the cells were harvested by centrifugation . The pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of lysis buffer ( 20mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1mM DTT ) per gram of wet cell pellet , plus 6 pro - tease inhibitor tablets per liter of lysis buffer . Cells were lysed in a microﬂuidizer ( Microﬂuidics Model M - 110EH - 30 Microﬂuidizer Pro - cessor ) at 23 kPSI for 5 to 6 passes . After lysis , 0 . 5 mM PMSF was added and the lysate was spun down in a JA - 10 ( Beckman ) rotor at 9 , 000 rpm for 25 minutes . The supernatant was transferred to prechilled 70 mL polycarbonate centrifuge tubes ( Beckman Coulter # 355655 ) and spun at 34 , 000 rpm for 75 minutes at 4 (cid:1) C in a Fiberlite F37L rotor ( Thermo - Scientiﬁc ) . The supernatant was ﬁltered Current Biology 28 , 3886 – 3891 . e1 – e4 , December 3 , 2018 e2 through cheesecloth into a graduated cylinder and the volume was measured . Under heavy stirring , 0 . 243 g of ammonium sulfate per mL of supernatant was added over approximately 30 minutes . The solution was stirred for an additional 30 minutes , then pelleted in the Fiberlite F37L rotor at 34 , 000 rpm for 90 minutes . The pellet was resuspended in 50 mL of PKME ( 25 mM PIPES , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT and 0 . 1 mM ATP ) and dialyzed against 8 L PKME overnight in 50 , 000 MWCO dialysis tubing . The dialysate was spun down at 34 , 000 rpm for 90 minutes in the Fiberlite F37L rotor . Ten milliliters of GS4B beads equilibrated in GST binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT ) were charged with 15 mg of GST - N - WASP - VCA to make a GST - VCA afﬁnity column . Additional binding buffer was added until no protein was detectable in the ﬂow through by Bradford assay . The column was then equilibrated in PKME pH 7 . 0 and then supernatant was loaded at 1 mL per min before washing the col - umn with additional PKME ( (cid:3) 45 mL ) . The column was washed with PKME + 150 mM KCl until no protein was detected in the ﬂow through by Bradford assay ( (cid:3) 30 mL ) . Protein was eluted with PKME + 1 M NaCl into (cid:3) 2 mL fractions until no protein was detected by a Bradford assay ( (cid:3) 30mL ) . Fractions containing Arp2 / 3 complex were pooled and dialyzed against 2 L of QA buffer ( 10 mM PIPES , 25 mM NaCl , 0 . 25 mM EGTA , 0 . 25 mM MgCl 2 , pH 6 . 8 w / KOH ) in 50 , 000 MWCO dialysis tubing overnight . The complex was then puriﬁed by ion exchange chromatography on an FPLC using a 1 mL MonoQ column with a linear gradient of QA buffer to 100 % QB buffer ( 10 mM PIPES , 500 nM NaCl , 0 . 25 mM EGTA , 0 . 25 mM MgCl 2 , pH 6 . 8 w / KOH ) over 40 column volumes with a ﬂow rate of 0 . 5 mL per minute . Fractions containing Arp2 / 3 complex were pooled and dialyzed against Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT in 50 , 000 MWCO dialysis tubing overnight . The dialysate was concentrated to 1 . 5 mL in a 30 , 000 MWCO concentrator tube ( Sartorius Vivaspin Turbo 15 # VS15T21 ) using the Fiberlite F13B rotor at 2 , 500 rpm for 5 to 10 minute cycles . Between each cycle the solution was mixed by gentle pipetting . The concentrated sample was loaded on a Superdex 200 size exclusion column in Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50mM NaCl , and 1mM DTT . Eluted fractions with pure Arp2 / 3 complex were pooled and concentrated as described above and the ﬁnal concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at 290 nm ( E 290 = 139 , 030 M - 1 cm - 1 ) before ﬂash freezing . To purify GST - Wsp1 - VCA , 5 mL of LB plus 100 m g / mL ampicillin and 35 m g / mL chloramphenicol was inoculated with BL21 ( DE3 ) - RIL cells transformed with a pGv67 - GST - Wsp1 - VCA plasmid and grown overnight at 37 (cid:1) C . One milliliter of this culture was used to inoculate 50 mL of LB plus ampicillin and chloramphenicol and was grown until turbid at 37 (cid:1) C with shaking at 180 rpm . Ten milliliters of this culture was used to inoculate each 1L of LB plus ampicillin and chloramphenicol . These cultures were grown at 37 (cid:1) C to an OD600 of 0 . 4 to 0 . 6 and induced with 400 m L of 1 M IPTG per liter of culture . The cultures were grown at 22 (cid:1) C for 12 - 14 hr . To each 1L culture , EDTA and PMSF were added to 2 mM and 0 . 5 mM , respectively , before pelleting at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4 (cid:1) C in the Fiberlite F8B rotor . The pellet was resuspended in 100 mL of lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) plus 2 protease inhibitor tablets . The cells were lysed by sonication on ice with intermittent pulses to keep the tem - perature below 10 (cid:1) C . The lysate was spun down for 45 min at 18 , 000 rpm in a JA - 20 rotor at 4 (cid:1) C . The clariﬁed lysate was loaded onto a column containing 10 mL of GS4B beads equilibrated in GST - binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 140 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) and washed with 7 column volumes of GST - binding buffer . Protein was eluted from the column with 30 mL of GST - elution buffer pH adjusted to 8 . 0 with NaOH ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 50 mM reduced L - glutathione ) . The elution was dialyzed overnight at 4 (cid:1) C in 2 L of 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT in 3500 MWCO dialysis tubing . The dialysate was then loaded onto a Source30Q column on an FPLC equilibrated in QA buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) . GST - Wsp1 - VCA was eluted from the column over a 20 column volume gradient to 100 % QB buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT ) . Fractions containing GST - Wsp1 - VCA were concentrated to 1 . 5 mL and ﬂowed over an Superdex 75 size exclusion col - umn equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 mM DTT . Pure fractions of GST - Wsp1 - VCA were pooled and concen - trated to desired volume using a 3500 MWCO spin concentrator tube ( Sartorius Vivaspin Turbo 15 # VS15T91 ) in the Fiberlite F13B rotor at 2 , 500 rpm for 5 to 10 minute cycles at 4 (cid:1) C . An extinction coefﬁcient of 5 , 500M - 1 cm - 1 was used to determine protein concentration . Biotin - inactivated myosin was prepared by reacting 2 mg of myosin with 5 m L of 250 mM EZ - Link - Maleimide - PEG 11 - Biotin dis - solved in DMSO . The labeling reaction was carried out in 500 m L reaction buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 500 mM KCl , 5 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 1 m M ATP and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) on ice for 6 hours . The Biotin - myosin was then dialyzed into 0 . 5 L of storage buffer ( 20 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 500 mM KCl , 5 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM DTT and 50 % glycerol ) using a 3500 MWCO dialysis thimble ( Thermoﬁsher Slide - A - Lyzer MINI dialysis unit 0069550 ) . Analytical Ultracentrifugation Dip1 was diluted to 6 . 9 , 13 . 7 , and 20 . 6 m M to a ﬁnal buffer concentration of 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1 mM TCEP . Cells were inserted into a Beckman An50 Ti rotor and spun at 50 , 000 rpm at 20 (cid:1) C in a Beckman XL - I analytical ultracentrifuge . Sedimen - tation was monitored using interference optics and the resulting radial interference scans were ﬁt using a non - interacting continuous c ( S ) distribution model in SEDFIT [ 37 ] . The frictional ratio was set to 1 . 2 for the initial ﬁt of the data without using the nonlinear regres - sion method and was then optimized using nonlinear regression algorithms to improve the ﬁt . The ﬁts were regularized using a con - ﬁdence level of 0 . 95 and were considered satisfactory if the root mean squared deviation was less than 0 . 01 and the residuals were random and less than 2 % of the signal . The ﬁnal parameters , including the ﬁtted values , the sedimentation coefﬁcient and the fric - tional ratios are shown in Table S1 . e3 Current Biology 28 , 3886 – 3891 . e1 – e4 , December 3 , 2018 TIRF microscopy slide preparation TIRF ﬂow chambers were constructed and reactions setup as previously described with slight modiﬁcations [ 19 ] . Coverslips ( 24 3 60 # 1 . 5 ) were cleaned in Coplin jars by sonicating in acetone followed by 1 M KOH for 25 min each , with a deionized water rinse between each sonication step . Coverslips were then rinsed twice with methanol and aminosilanized by incubating in 1 % APTES ( Sigma ) , 5 % acetic acid in methanol solution for 10 min before sonicating for 5 min , and then incubating for an additional 15 min . Coverslips were then rinsed with 2 volumes of methanol followed by thorough ﬂushing with deionized water . After air drying , TIRF chambers were created by sandwiching cleaned coverslips and a glass microscope slide using double - sided tape to create an (cid:3) 14 m L , 0 . 5 cm wide chamber . Chambers were passivated by incubating chambers for 4 - 5 hours in 300 mg / mL methoxy PEG succinimidyl succi - nate , MW5000 ( JenKem ) containing 1 % – 3 % biotin - PEG NHS ester , MW5000 ( JenKem ) dissolved in 0 . 1 M NaHCO 3 pH 8 . 3 . Excess PEG was washed away with 0 . 1 M NaHCO 3 pH 8 . 3 and chambers were stored in deionized water for less than 1 week . All cleaning steps were carried out at room temperature . Immediately prior to imaging , chambers were incubated for 8 minutes with 1 m M NeutrAvidin ( ThermoFisher ) followed by 8 minutes with 50 - 150 nM biotin inactivated myosin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc ) , both prepared in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 600 mM NaCl . Chambers were washed 2 times with 20 mg / mL BSA in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 600 mM NaCl followed by 2 washes with 20 mg / mL BSA in 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl . Chambers were ﬁnally pre - incubated with TIRF buffer ( 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 50 mM KCl , 100 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 25 mM Glucose , 0 . 5 % Metylcellulose ( 400 cP at 2 % ) , 0 . 02 mg / mL Catalase ( Sigma ) and 0 . 1 mg / mL Glucose Oxidase ( MP Biomedicals ) ) . Actin Polymerization Reactions in TIRF chambers In a typical reaction , 1 m L of 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM EGTA was mixed with 5 m L of 9 m M 33 % Oregon Green actin and incubated for 2 minutes . Four microliters of the actin solution was then added to 16 m L of a solution containing 1 . 25x TIRF buffer and any other proteins . Reactions were imaged on a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope equipped with 100x 1 . 49 numerical aperture TIRF objec - tive , 50 mW 488 nm and 561 nm Sapphire continuous wave solid state laser lines ( Coherent ) , a dual band TIRF ( zt488 / 561rpc ) ﬁlter cube ( Chroma C143315 ) , and a 1x (cid:4) 1 . 5x intermediate magniﬁcation module . Images were collected using an 512x512 pixel EM - CCD camera ( iXon3 , Andor ) . For two color reactions , typical imaging conditions were 50 ms exposures with the 488 nm laser and 50 to 100 ms exposures with the 561 nm laser at 1 s intervals . For photobleaching measurements of 568 - Dip1 , 150 ms exposures with the 561 nm laser and 500 ms intervals were used . The concentration of 568 - Dip1 was kept in the low nanomolar range in all assays to prevent high backgrounds of non - speciﬁcally adsorbed 568 - Dip1 from obscuring Dip1 ﬁlament binding events . Pyrene Actin Polymerization Assay In a typical reaction , 2 m L of 10X ME buffer ( 5 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM EGTA ) was added to 20 m L of 15 % pyrene labeled actin and allowed to incubate for 2 minutes in 96 well ﬂat bottom black polystyrene assay plates ( Corning 3686 ) . To initiate the reaction , 78 m L of buffer containing all other proteins was added to the actin , bringing the ﬁnal buffer concentration in the reaction to 10 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCL , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 200 m M ATP and 1 mM DTT . Polymerization of actin was monitored using a TECAN Saﬁre 2 plate reader by exciting the pyrene actin at 365 nm and monitoring the emission at 407 nm . Pointed End Binding Assay A solution of 7 . 5 m M 33 % Oregon Green actin was pre - incubated for 2 minutes with 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM EGTA to exchange the calcium in G - actin storage buffer for magnesium . The actin was then diluted in TIRF buffer and reacted for 20 minutes . Filaments were sheared by drawing solution two times through a 30 - gauge needle on a 3 mL syringe . The reaction was diluted 10 - fold in TIRF buffer containing 6 nM 568 - Dip1 , 500 nM S . pombe Arp2 / 3 complex , and 0 . 1 m M 33 % Oregon Green actin . Control reactions did not contain Arp2 / 3 complex . Binding to pointed ends was assayed by equilibrating the ﬁnal mixture for 2 minutes and then imaging by TIRF mi - croscopy in ﬂow chambers as described above . TIRF Microscopy Image Analysis Images were prepared in ImageJ . Background was subtracted with a 10 - pixel rolling ball radius for the 561 channel and a 15 - pixel rolling ball radius for the 488 channel . In panels showing actin ﬁlaments , a 0 . 5 micron sigma gaussian blur was applied to the 488 channel . The total actin polymer was calculated using a custom image processing script run in MATLAB ( Mathworks ) , described as follows . For each frame , pixels corresponding to ﬁlament ﬂuorescence were identiﬁed using image segmentation followed by morphological area opening to remove non - ﬁlament small ﬂuorescent objects . The ﬁnal pixel number value was converted to micro - meters ( 1px = 106 . 7 nm ) to yield the total length of actin ﬁlaments in the image frame . To measure the number of Dip1 pointed end binding events ( Figure 3 ) and calculate the branching rates from different ﬁlament sources ( Figure 3 ) , reactions were analyzed up to 120 s after imaging was initiated . A custom ImageJ plugin was used to measure the lengths of actin ﬁlaments over time ( Figure 3 , plugin was a gift from Jeff Kuhn ) . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The number of replicates and meaning of error bars can be found in the ﬁgure legends . The signiﬁcance of data in Figure 3D was calculated using a two - tailed t test assuming unequal variances . Current Biology 28 , 3886 – 3891 . e1 – e4 , December 3 , 2018 e4
