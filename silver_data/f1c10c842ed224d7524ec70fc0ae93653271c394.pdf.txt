A clathrin - and caveolin - independent endocytosis pathway is used by important physiological cargos , including interleukin - 2 receptors ( IL - 2 R ) . However , this process lacks morphological and dynamic data . Our electron microscopy ( EM ) and tomography studies reveal that IL - 2 R - pits and vesicles are initiated at the base of protrusions . We identify the WAVE complex as a specific endocytic actor . The WAVE complex interacts with IL - 2 R , via a WAVE - interacting receptor sequence ( WIRS ) present in the receptor polypeptide , and allows for receptor clustering close to membrane protrusions . In addition , using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy ( TIRF ) and automated analysis we demonstrate that two timely distinct bursts of actin polymerization are required during IL - 2 R uptake , promoted first by the WAVE complex and then by N - WASP . Finally , our data reveal that dynamin acts as a transi - tion controller for the recruitment of Arp 2 / 3 activators required for IL - 2 R endocytosis . Altogether , our work identifies the spatio - temporal specific role of factors initiating clathrin - independent endocytosis by a unique mechanism that does not depend on the deformation of a flat membrane , but rather on that of membrane protrusions .

Besides the entry of nutrients , endocytosis is involved in many processes , such as cell migration , division , signalling , differentiation and immune response ( Sigismund et al , 2012 ) . Over the years , different endocytic pathways have been identified . So far , the best studied pathway is clathrin - dependent endocytosis , involving many well - characterized factors ( Mousavi et al , 2004 ) . In this process , the cargos are recruited into clathrin - coated pits initiated from a flat membrane that then form clathrin - coated vesicles ( Harding et al , 1983 ; McMahon & Boucrot , 2011 ) . Several clathrin - independent routes have been uncovered ; however , their molecular mechanisms are not fully understood ( Howes et al , 2010b ; Sandvig et al , 2011 ) . Cytokine receptors , like IL - 2R , were among the first physiological examples of cargos taken up by a clathrin - independent mechanism ( Subtil et al , 1994 ; Lamaze et al , 2001 ; Sauvonnet et al , 2005 ) . These receptors include the b - chain of the interleukin - 2 and inter - leukin - 15 receptors ( IL - 2R b ) and the common cytokine c - chain ( IL - 2R c c ) of the receptors for interleukins 2 , 4 , 7 , 9 , 15 and 21 . Upon cytokine stimulation , they induce signalling cascades promoting cell proliferation in the immune response ( Gaffen , 2001 ) . These cytokine receptors can be internalized constitutively , that is independently of the ligand in various cell types ( He´mar et al , 1995 ; Subtil et al , 1997 ) , suggesting a widespread mechanism . Once internalized , the receptors are sorted into lysosomes where they are degraded ( He´mar et al , 1994 , 1995 ) . Thus , endocytosis tightly controls their ability to transduce the proliferation signal ( Gesbert et al , 2004 ) and further insight into the endocytosis process is crucial to fully understand cytokine receptor functioning . As this process does not require known membrane coat compo - nents , such as clathrin and caveolin ( Lamaze et al , 2001 ; Sauvonnet et al , 2005 ) , an important issue arises regarding the mechanism of 1 Unité de Biologie des Interactions Cellulaires , Institut Pasteur , Paris , France 2 CNRS UMR 3691 , Paris , France 3 Sorbonne Universités , UPMC Univ Paris 06 , CNRS , Institut de Biologie Paris - Seine ( IBPS ) , FR 3631 , Electron Microscopy Facility , Paris , France 4 Electron Microscopy Unit , Institute of Biotechnology , University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland 5 Unité d ’ Analyse d ’ Images Biologiques , Institut Pasteur , Paris , France 6 Laboratoire de Biochimie , Unité Mixte de Recherche 7654 Ecole Polytechnique Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , Palaiseau , France * Corresponding author .

Another key question addresses the morphology of the pit , vesicle and intracellular carriers containing IL - 2R , for which no data are available . In contrast , the knowledge of this endocytic process is more advanced at the molecular level . Indeed , we previously identi - fied a dozen factors implicated in IL - 2R endocytosis , including dynamin , actin and related factors , such as cortactin , N - WASP , Arp2 / 3 , PI3K , Vav2 , Rac1 and PAKs ( Sauvonnet et al , 2005 ; Grassart et al , 2008 , 2010 ; Basquin & Sauvonnet , 2013 ; Basquin et al , 2013 ) . Many of these factors are also involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis , yielding little insights into the unique mecha - nism of clathrin - independent endocytosis . However , we have demonstrated that common factors , like N - WASP and cortactin , are regulated differently depending on the mechanism . During IL - 2R internalization , PI3K interacts with the receptor and activates Vav2 , which then induces Rac1 and Paks . This in turn enhances the asso - ciation of cortactin - N - WASP , thereby promoting actin polymeriza - tion most likely when dynamin is recruited ( Sauvonnet et al , 2005 ; Grassart et al , 2008 , 2010 ; Basquin & Sauvonnet , 2013 ; Basquin et al , 2013 ) . The present model proposes that all of these factors regulate the last step of endocytosis , the vesicle scission from the plasma membrane . However , validation of this hypothesis requires dynamic data . Besides this current model , nothing is known regard - ing the initiation of the IL - 2R pit and vesicle at either the molecular or the morphological level . In this study , we investigated the struc - tures of the IL - 2R - containing pits and vesicles and their formation using ultrastructural data , combined with biochemical experiments and dynamic image analysis . Results Morphology of IL - 2 R - intracellular carriers The main goal of this study was to obtain structural data to better understand IL - 2R endocytosis . To characterize the morphology of membrane and intracellular carriers during all the stages of endo - cytosis , we performed a cell surface immunogold labelling of IL - 2R . We incubated cells at 37 ° C for several time points to allow for endocytosis , fixed them and observed them by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) . As IL - 2R internalization occurs in several cell types , constitutively or ligand induced , we decided to use Hep2 b cells , a human epithelial cell line stably expressing IL - 2R b ( Grassart et al , 2008 ) to address the constitutive endocyto - sis . We used Kit225 cells , a human T - cell line expressing the endogenous high - affinity IL - 2R , to study the IL - 2 - induced endocyto - sis ( Basquin et al , 2013 ) . After a brief labelling at 4 ° C of IL - 2R b ( using an antibody targeting IL - 2R b ( Subtil et al , 1994 ) and protein A - gold ) , cells were incubated for a sufficient time at 37 ° C ( 7 min for Kit225 and 12 min for Hep2 b ) to allow the observation of intra - cellular vesicles and endosomes bearing IL - 2R . TEM observations of ultrathin sections ( 70 nm ) showed a specific labelling of IL - 2R b , since cells incubated with protein A - gold alone showed very rarely gold particles compared to those incubated with the antibody and protein A - gold ( Supplementary Fig S1 ) . TEM data show the uptake of IL - 2R in three endocytic compartments in both cell lines ( Fig 1 ) . Indeed , we observed IL - 2R b in vesicles of ovoid shapes having sizes from 40 to 180 nm ( mean of diameter 95 nm (cid:1) 34 nm , Fig 1A , B , D , E and I ) , in early endosomes ( Fig 1C and F ) and in multivesicular bodies ( Fig 1C , G and H ) . These first ultrastructural data show the different steps of IL - 2R b endocytosis and reveal the internalization of the receptor into small vesicles and its further trafficking to early and late endosomes , as proposed previously ( He´mar et al , 1995 ; Basquin et al , 2013 ) . Moreover , the distribution of IL - 2R b in the endocytic compartments was equivalent in both Hep2 b and Kit225 cells , showing the same intracellular trafficking of the receptor in both cell lineages , epithelial and lymphoid , respectively . Since all vesicles seen were smaller than 200 nm , our data also show that IL - 2R b does not enter by a macropinocytic pathway ( Lim & Gleeson , 2011 ) . In addition , the shape of these vesicles does not fit with caveolae or with the complex tubulo - vesicular ring - shaped CLIC morphology ( Howes et al , 2010a ) , both of which use a clathrin - independent pathway . Thus , these first ultrastructural data indicate that the endocytic vesicle harbouring IL - 2R is morphologically distinct from clathrin - independent endocytic carriers reported thus far . The IL - 2 R - containing pit is localized at the base of membrane protrusions To obtain data regarding the pit and vesicle initiation at the morpho - logical level , we performed the same experiment as for Fig 1 , but incubated the cells only briefly at 37 ° C ( 2 min for Kit225 and 7 min for Hep2 b ) to avoid the complete endocytosis of IL - 2R . Strikingly , in Hep2 b cells , we saw that IL - 2R b localized on or near protrusions ( Fig 2A – C , I , J , M and N ) . In order to quantify the relevance of this observation , we analysed all gold beads , representing IL - 2R b , at the plasma membrane and measured with ImageJ the distance to the nearest protrusion observed ( Fig 2I ) . As a control , we also analysed the localization of clathrin - coated pits ( CCP ) and transferrin ( Tf ) , a cargo using the clathrin - mediated route ( Fig 2D and I , Supplemen - tary Fig S2A ) . We defined five classes of locations with respect to protrusions ( Fig 2I ) : on protrusion , at its base , 100 – 300 nm , 300 – 500 nm and > 500 nm from the next protrusion . Quantification of the data shows that 79 % of IL - 2R b is close to protrusions ( < 300 nm ) at the plasma membrane , while this association is poorly observed with clathrin - coated pits or Tf ( 42 % , Fig 2I , Supple - mentary Fig S2B ) . This association of IL - 2R close with protrusions does not depend on clathrin because its depletion by siRNA ( siRNA CHC ) does not change IL - 2R distribution ( Supplementary Fig S2C – E ) . Interestingly , we observed the same striking distribution of the receptor close to protrusion in T cells endogenously expressing IL - 2R ( Kit225 ) ( Fig 2E – H and O ) . This association of IL - 2R with protrusions was not enhanced by the ligand IL - 2 ( 75 % ( - IL - 2 ) or 79 % ( + IL - 2 ) Fig 2O ) . To better characterize the IL - 2R pit and vesicle formation , we decided to clarify the role of dynamin , as this GTPase is an essential actor of IL - 2R uptake ( Lamaze et al , 2001 ) ( inhibition up to 80 % in dynamin 2 - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig S3 ) ) . Immunogold labelling and TEM observations of cells depleted for dynamin 2 showed IL - 2R b in unconstricted pits ( U - shape pits , Fig 2L ) or in long tubular pits still connected to the plasma membrane ( Fig 2K ) , as was reported for CCP ( Damke et al , 1994 ; Macia et al , 2006 ; Wu et al , 2010 ) . This result strengthens the importance of dynamin in the last stage of endocytosis to drive the scission of the IL - 2R b - containing vesicle . However , dynamin 2 is not required for the enrichment of IL - 2R b to membrane protrusions , The EMBO Journal Vol 34 | No 16 | 2015 ª 2015 The Authors The EMBO Journal Protrusion - based endocytosis of IL - 2 R Cyril Basquin et al 2148 Published online : June 29 , 2015 as IL - 2R - pits ( unconstricted or long tubules ) are located at the base of protrusions ( Fig 2K , L and P ) . Further analysis of all EM data revealed that most of the pits having IL - 2R b are seen at the base of such membrane protrusions ( Fig 2A – C , E – H and J ) . All these data suggest the importance of these protrusions in pit initiation . In order to observe the 3D structure of pits containing IL - 2R b , we performed electron tomography . First , we observed that IL - 2R b is located in small invaginations at the base of protrusions ( Fig 2M , Supplementary Movie S1 ) . At a later stage of endocytosis , once the neck is tight , IL - 2R b is located in not completely spherical vesicles at the base of protrusions ( Fig 2N , Supplementary Movie S2 ) . Altogether , these ultrastructural studies of IL - 2R b reveal that the receptor is mainly located in protrusion - rich regions of the plasma membrane ( Fig 2 ) and that these pits and vesicles are initiated at the base of such structures . These results are in marked contrast with the current knowledge about the initiation of endocy - tosis starting with the invagination of flat membrane ( Harding et al , 1983 ) . The WAVE complex drives IL - 2 R close to protrusions We next searched for the factor promoting the association of IL - 2R b with these protrusions . Branched actin polymerization is known to be the driving force behind membrane extensions . The WAVE complex is a nucleation - promoting factor activating the actin - related proteins 2 and 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) complex , inducing actin polymerization and membrane protrusion ( Oikawa et al , 2004 ; Steffen et al , 2004 ) . This prompted us to investigate the role of Arp2 / 3 and the WAVE complexes in IL - 2R b endocytosis . First , we confirmed that Arp2 / 3 activation was required for IL - 2R b , as treatment with CK - 666 ( a specific Arp2 / 3 inhibitor ) strongly affected IL - 2R b uptake ( 90 % of inhibition , Supplementary Fig S4A ) . Then , to investigate the role of the WAVE complex , Hep2 b cells were individually depleted using small interfering RNAs ( siRNA ) for Abi1 , Sra1 , Wave2 and Brk1 , four members of this pentameric complex ( Gautreau et al , 2004 ) ( Fig 3A – D , Supplementary Fig S5 ) . We simultaneously followed the uptake of IL - 2R b and transferrin ( Tf ) by incubating cells with a fluorescent antibody against IL - 2R b and fluorescent Tf for 15 min at 37 ° C ( Grassart et al , 2008 ) ( Fig 3A , B and D ) . We observed that depletion of Abi1 , Wave2 , Brk1 or Sra1 clearly inhibited IL - 2R b entry ( Fig 3A , B and D ) . Quantification of the data using Icy soft - ware ( de Chaumont et al , 2012 ; Basquin et al , 2013 ) showed that the depletion of each member of the WAVE complex led to an inhibition of IL - 2R b entry up to 65 % ( Fig 3D , Supplementary Fig S5A ) . Since the depletion of one subunit destabilizes the whole complex ( Dubielecka et al , 2011 ) , our results clearly show the involvement of the WAVE complex in IL - 2R b uptake . In contrast , Tf uptake , requiring the clathrin - dependent route , was not affected ( Fig 3A , B and D , Supplementary Fig S5B ) . Altogether , these data demonstrate that the WAVE complex is a new specific factor A D E G H I F B C Figure 1 . Morphology of IL - 2 R intracellular carriers . A – H Hep 2 b cells or Kit 225 cells were incubated at 4 ° C with an anti - IL - 2 R antibody and then with protein A coupled to 10 - nm gold beads . Endocytosis was enabled by incubating the Hep 2 b cells for 12 min ( A – C ) or the Kit 225 cells for 7 min ( D – H ) at 37 ° C . Cells were fixed and embedded in epoxy resin , and sections were analysed by TEM . Inside the cells , IL - 2 R can be seen in small endocytic vesicle ( A , B , D , E ) , in early endosomes ( C , F ) and in multivesicular bodies / late endosomes ( C , G , H ) .

Next , we tested the role of the WAVE complex in the recruit - ment of IL - 2R b to membrane protrusions . After siRNA treatment , depleting the cells for Abi1 ( Western blot in Supplementary Fig S3A ) , IL - 2R b was immunogold labelled and TEM data were quantified as described in Fig 2 . Strikingly , the depletion of Abi1 resulted in a strong reduction in the association of IL - 2R b with protrusions compared to control cells ( Fig 3E – I ) . Indeed , in Abi1 - depleted cells , we found only 40 % of IL - 2R b in close proximity to protrusions compared to 80 % in control cells ( Fig 3E and I ) . Note - worthy , the amount of protrusions in Abi1 - depleted cells was slightly affected ( < 20 % ) compared to control cells ( Supplementary Fig S4B and C ) , as was previously reviewed ( Krause & Gautreau , 2014 ) . This indicates that WAVE is required to drive the receptors to protrusions and / or is only involved in the formation of such protrusions . Nevertheless , these data point out the essential role of the WAVE complex in directing IL - 2R b close to protrusions where the pit is created . The WAVE complex interacts with IL - 2 R To determine the role of the WAVE complex in bringing IL - 2R to protrusions , we tested whether or not these two proteins interact . To do so , we constructed GFP - tagged forms of Wave2 , Brk1 and Abi1 , transfected them independently into Hep2 b cells and immu - noprecipitated them using antibodies directed against GFP . All three members of the complex could be co - immunoprecipitated with the other members of the complex , such as Sra1 ( Fig 4 ) . Strikingly , IL - 2R b could also be co - immunoprecipitated with Brk1 , Abi1 and Wave2 ( Fig 4A and B , Supplementary Fig S6 ) , in contrast to transferrin receptor , TfR ( Fig 4B , Supplementary Fig S6 ) . In addition , the depletion of Wave2 abrogates the co - immunoprecipi - tation between IL - 2R b and Brk1 , confirming the importance of the whole pentameric WAVE complex for this interaction ( Fig 4B , Supplementary Fig S6 ) . Altogether , these results confirm the specific interaction between IL - 2R and the WAVE complex . Recent work by Chen et al ( Chen et al , 2014 ) identified a consensus peptide motif , WIRS , which binds to a conserved site on the surface of the WAVE complex , formed by the Abi and Sra subunits . This motif is found in the intracellular tails of a large number of diverse neuronal receptors ( Chen et al , 2014 ) . Based on the definition of the WIRS consensus motif , Φ - x - T / S - F - x - x ( Φ = preference for bulky hydrophobic residues ; x = any residue ) , we found that the IL - 2R b cytoplasmic tail contains a potential WIRS ( peptide sequence YCTFPS ) that is conserved throughout mammals , with the exception of rodents ( see Fig 4C ) . To understand the role of this motif , we generated a mutant replacing the two conserved residues of the WIRS sequence ( YCAAPS , called TFAA ) and stably transfected it into Hep2 cells ( Fig 4D and E ) . We found that mutating the WIRS motif impairs the binding of IL - 2R b to the WAVE complex ( Fig 4E ) and affects its endocytosis ( Fig 4D ) . Together , these data strongly indicate that IL - 2R b contains a WIRS motif , which allows it to interact with the WAVE complex , a process essential for its internalization . The WAVE complex and N - WASP are recruited at two stages of IL - 2 R uptake Interestingly , our present and past ( Grassart et al , 2010 ) results demonstrate that IL - 2R b endocytosis requires two activators of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization : the WAVE complex ( Fig 3 ) and N - WASP ( Grassart et al , 2010 ) . This new finding raises an important issue about the role of each activator and the step of endocytosis in which they are involved . The activators may act cooperatively or independently . Therefore , we analysed the time of recruitment of the WAVE complex , N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 during IL - 2R b endocytosis using time - lapse total internal reflection fluores - cence ( TIRF ) microscopy . This technique is very convenient to visu - alize events occurring close to the plasma membrane , including endocytosis and membrane protrusions ( Merrifield et al , 2002 ; Xu et al , 2009 ) . To allow the visualization of IL - 2R endocytosis , the receptor was surface labelled ( 2 min at 37 ° C ) with an anti - IL - 2R b antibody coupled to Cy3 fluorochrome , the unbound antibodies were washed away , and then , cells were imaged with TIRF micro - scope for maximum 30 min at 37 ° C at 0 . 5 Hz . This allowed us to examine endocytosis and not exocytosis , since we observed only the internalization of the surface - labelled receptor ( He´mar et al , 1995 ) . At the plasma membrane , IL - 2R b moved on the surface of the cell and some receptors stop , remaining stable and visible for approximately 110 s and finally disappearing from the TIRF field at the end of the endocytic process ( Supplementary Movie S3 , Fig 5A – F ) . We performed an automated analysis of TIRF images with the open - source image analysis software Icy ( de Chaumont et al , 2012 ) to analyse at least 1 , 000 IL - 2R tracks . This analysis allowed us to detect the tracks , co - localize them and sort out the intensity profile of each track . To observe the recruitment of the WAVE complex , Hep2 b cells were transfected with GFP - Abi1 or GFP - Brk1 ( Supple - mentary Fig S7 ) , and TIRF analysis enabled the identification of IL - 2R - WAVE co - localized tracks . We found that the WAVE complex appeared before IL - 2R b clusters at the plasma membrane and disap - peared before the entry of the receptor into the cell ( Fig 5A and B ) . Quantitation of the data demonstrated that the WAVE complex ( GFP - Abi1 and GFP - Brk1 ) appeared around 35 s before IL - 2R , but ◀ Figure 2 .

Consis - tently , this experiment showed that Arp2 / 3 is recruited during two stages of endocytosis ( Fig 5E and F ) . First , Arp2 / 3 appeared before the IL - 2R b cluster , as for the WAVE complex , and remained visible after the entry of the receptor with a second peak of recruitment at the end of the process , like N - WASP ( Fig 5E – H ) . Therefore , our results reveal two bursts of actin polymerization during IL - 2R b uptake induced by the recruitment of two activators of Arp2 / 3 ( WAVE , N - WASP ) at two stages of the process ( Fig 5G ) . Dynamin 2 is a transition controller for WAVE / N - WASP recruitment Considerable evidence supports the view that dynamin and actin filaments play interdependent roles during clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytic processes in mammalian cells ( Menon & Schafer , 2013 ) . Thus , we decided to analyse the role of dynamin in IL - 2R endocytosis with respect to the two newly involved F - actin regulators : WAVE and N - WASP . A C D E B Figure 4 .

E Lysates of Hep 2 b WT - and TFAA - mutant cells transfected with GFP - Abi 1 or GFP were immunoprecipitated using an anti - GFP or anti - mouse IgG as described in ( B ) . ª 2015 The Authors The EMBO Journal Vol 34 | No 16 | 2015 Cyril Basquin et al Protrusion - based endocytosis of IL - 2 R The EMBO Journal 2153 Published online : June 29 , 2015 First , we tested if dynamin directly or indirectly controls the interaction of IL - 2R b with the WAVE complex . Hep2 b cells were depleted for dynamin 2 and transfected with GFP - Brk1 or GFP ; immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described in Fig 4 ( Fig 6A ) . Compared with control cells , dynamin - depleted cells showed an increase in the amount of IL - 2R b co - immunoprecipitated with Brk1 ( 1 . 4 fold , Fig 6A ) . Thus , in the absence of dynamin 2 , WAVE - IL - 2R interaction is stronger and / or longer . This suggests that the recruitment of dynamin 2 affects IL - 2R - WAVE interaction . To strengthen this hypothesis , we inhibited dynamin GTPase activ - ity using dynasore ( Macia et al , 2006 ) or dyngo - 4A ( Harper et al , 2011 ) that should block the vesicle formation after dynamin recruit - ment ( Macia et al , 2006 ; Grassart et al , 2014 ) , leading to persistence of dynamin 2 at endocytic sites ( Grassart et al , 2014 ) . In contrast to the depletion of dynamin 2 , we observed that dynamin inhibition strongly decreased the co - immunoprecipitation of IL - 2R b with the WAVE complex ( > 80 % reduction , Fig 6B ) . Thus , our data suggest that the prolonged presence of dynamin prevents the interaction between IL - 2R b and the WAVE complex . These results are in total agreement with our TIRF analysis ( Fig 5 ) and confirm the early involvement of the WAVE complex during IL - 2R b pit and vesicle formation . As off - target effects of dyngo - 4A and dynasore have been reported previously , we decided to better investigate the role of dynamin during IL - 2R b endocytosis . Thus , we performed TIRF live imaging in cells depleted for dynamin 2 and analysed WAVE , A B C D E G H F Figure 5 .

In contrast , we found a two - fold increase in the amount of co - localized tracks between IL - 2R b and either Abi1 ( WAVE complex ) or p16 ( Arp2 / 3 ) ( Fig 6E ) . Coherently , in the absence of dynamin 2 , GFP - Abi1 - IL - 2R or GFP - Brk1 - IL - 2R , and GFP - p16 - IL - 2R tracks were co - localized much longer than in the control cells ( compare Figs 6 and 5 , Supplementary Fig S7 ) . These TIRF data indicate that dynamin 2 controls the departure of the WAVE complex and is necessary for N - WASP recruitment to IL - 2R b tracks at the plasma membrane . Altogether , these results reveal the pivotal and dual role played by dynamin 2 in the clathrin - independent endocytosis of IL - 2R b . Indeed , our ultrastructural data confirm the involvement of this large GTPase in the scission of the IL - 2R b vesicle . In addition , our immunoprecipitation and TIRF data reveal the second action of dynamin 2 as a transition controller for the recruitment of two Arp2 / 3 activators : WAVE and N - WASP . Discussion This study reveals a new mechanism that we call protrusion - based endocytosis , which is used to internalize receptors into small vesicle ( Fig 7 ) . So far , all models of receptor - mediated endocytosis begin with the invagination from the flat plasma membrane using coat component . For example , during clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the recruitment of proteins , such as the BAR domain FCHO , AP - 2 and clathrin , are required for the induction of the first invagination of flat plasma membrane in order to form the pit ( Reider et al , 2009 ; Henne et al , 2010 ; McMahon & Boucrot , 2011 ; Cocucci et al , 2012 ) . Therefore , the current model for endocytic pit formation is the inward bending of the membrane directed by proteins / lipids induc - ing the invagination ( Mooren et al , 2012 ) . In this work , we show that IL - 2R endocytosis requires its recruitment at the base of protru - sions via its association with the WAVE complex . It does not seem that IL - 2R induces protrusions , but rather that IL - 2R , through inter - actions with the WAVE complex via its WIRS motif , would be recruited to these structures . The WAVE - induced , outward forces generating protrusions would create at its base the initial invagina - tion to form the pit where IL - 2R b would be trapped . This initial pit at the base of the WAVE complex would allow IL - 2R to cluster . The formation of such an initial depression is not homogenous . This is consistent with the variation of vesicles sizes , whose morphology is not as calibrated as for clathrin - or caveolin - coated vesicles . Also , our results are clearly distinct from previous findings showing that clathrin - coated pits can close with the formation of a protrusion at one side of the pit ( Shevchuk et al , 2012 ) . In this previous report , the protrusion was solely involved in the scission of some of the CCPs . Instead , our present study indicates that protrusions initiate the creation of the clathrin - independent endocytic pit . Interestingly , other cargos might use this protrusion - based endocytosis . One candidate might be the insulin receptor that was previously shown as strongly associated with villi at the cell surface of lymphocytes ( Carpentier et al , 1981 ) . A recent work described a clathrin - / caveolin - independent , though dynamin - / endophilin - dependent , pathway called FEME that is used by IL - 2R , as well as several G - protein - coupled receptors , including a 2a - and b 1 - adrenergic , dopaminergic D3 and D4 receptors , muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 , and receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR ( Boucrot et al , 2015 ) . Coherently with our study , this pathway is prominent at the leading edges of the cell that coincide with protru - sive activity . Another list of putative cargos using protrusion - based endocytosis may include receptors having a WIRS motif allowing their interaction with the WAVE complex ( Chen et al , 2014 ) . Indeed , the Rosen laboratory has identified around 120 diverse membrane proteins , including protocadherins , ROBOs , netrin receptors , neuroli - gins , GPCRs and channels ( Chen et al , 2014 ) , all of which are poten - tial candidates . In addition , our study reveals the key role of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization during IL - 2R endocytosis . Indeed , the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor , CK - 666 , strongly affects IL - 2R ( 90 % of inhibition , Supplementary Fig S4 ) ; in contrast , the clathrin - dependent pathway was less affected ( 50 % of inhibition , Supplementary Fig S4 ) . The fact that two Arp2 / 3 activators , N - WASP and the WAVE complex , are involved in IL - 2R endocytosis , whereas only N - WASP is required for clathrin - dependent endocytosis , might account for this difference . Indeed , in the case of IL - 2R endocytosis , we observed two bursts of actin polymerization . The first burst mediated by the WAVE complex appears before IL - 2R b clustering ; it should be responsible for the recruitment of the receptor at the endocytic site to initiate pit formation . Then , N - WASP induces a second round of Figure 7 . Protrusion - based endocytosis of IL - 2 R . IL - 2 R by interacting with the WAVE complex is located at the basis of membrane protrusions , thereby creating an initial pit ( 1 ) . This first step implicates outward forces ( arrows ) induced by the WAVE complex - mediated actin polymerization ( 1 ) . Once the pit would be done , dynamin would be recruited to the neck of the vesicle and the scission of the vesicle would be helped by the cortactin , N - WASP and another round of branched actin polymerization ( 2 ) . This second step involves inward forces ( arrows ) generatedbyN - WASP - mediatedactinpolymerization ( 2 ) . Finally , thevesiclewouldmigrateinsidethecell , thankstoactinpolymerization , andwouldeventuallyfusetoearly endosome ( 3 ) . The EMBO Journal Vol 34 | No 16 | 2015 ª 2015 The Authors The EMBO Journal Protrusion - based endocytosis of IL - 2 R Cyril Basquin et al 2156 Published online : June 29 , 2015 Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization at a later stage just before the internalization of IL - 2R b . This last event of actin polymerization should aid inward forces of the new - born vesicle to detach from plasma membrane and to enter deeper inside into the cell , as it is proposed for the clathrin - dependent pathway ( Boulant et al , 2011 ; Taylor et al , 2011 ) . Therefore , our work identifies the unique feature of clathrin - and caveolae - independent internalization of IL - 2R b that requires two rounds of actin polymerization induced by two activators and triggers two stages of the process , pit initiation and vesicle scission . Another important finding of our work concerns the dual role of dynamin in the clathrin - independent process . Thanks to our ultra - structural data showing the abnormal IL - 2R b pit morphology in the absence of dynamin , our work reinforces the role of this GTPase in the vesicle scission . The second role of dynamin would be a transi - tion controller for the recruitment of actin regulators during IL - 2R endocytosis . Indeed , our dynamic analysis reveals that dynamin is required for the recruitment of N - WASP during the last step of endo - cytosis . This recruitment of N - WASP promotes F - actin that would generate inward forces to detach the vesicle from the plasma membrane in combination with the pinchase activity of dynamin . Indeed , previous studies have shown that many dynamin - interacting partners , like cortactin , link dynamin to actin polymerization via Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP ( Menon & Schafer , 2013 ) . In the case of IL - 2R uptake , cortactin – N - WASP interaction was shown to be essential ( Grassart et al , 2010 ) . Thus , our work , as well as past data , indicates that the recruitment of dynamin will bring together cortactin , N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex to allow the scission of the IL - 2R vesicle . The remaining point to be discussed is the regulation of the recruitment of actors of IL - 2R b endocytosis . We previously identi - fied Rac1 and PI3K as specific and essential upstream regulators of IL - 2R uptake ( Basquin et al , 2013 ) . We already proposed that they would allow the recruitment of N - WASP to cortactin , with cortactin itself being linked to dynamin ( Gesbert et al , 2004 ; Grassart et al , 2008 ; Basquin et al , 2013 ) . Therefore , Rac1 and PI3K should regulate the last step of endocytosis , the vesicle scission . However , our new result implicates the WAVE complex at a very early stage of IL - 2R b uptake , modifying our view on the role of these regulators . Indeed , the WAVE complex is clearly known to be stimulated at the plasma membrane by the Rac GTPase and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Lebensohn & Kirschner , 2009 ) . Rac1 and PI3K could thus also promote the initiation of the IL - 2R b - containing pits , acting as general regulators of several stages of the IL - 2R endocytosis . Materials and Methods Cells , constructs , siRNA and reagents Hep2 b cells stably expressing IL - 2R b ( Grassart et al , 2008 ) were grown in DMEM containing 10 % FCS and 1 mg / l l of geneticin ( Gibco ) .

The dynamin inhibitors dynasore ( abcam ) and Dyngo - 4A TM ( abcam ) were used at 80 l M and at 30 l M , respectively , and incubated with serum - starved cells for 45 min at 37 ° C .

GFP - Abi1 , GFP - Brk1 , GFP - Wave2 and GFP - p16 were obtained by subcloning Abi1 , Brk1 , Wave2 and p16 ( Gautreau et al , 2004 ) into pcDNA - FR - PC - GFP vector .

IL - 2R b mutated on threonin 420 and phenyl - alanin 421 to alanin residues ( TFAA ) was obtained by PCR using the QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) and the following oligonucleotide : 5 0 - GTCAGGGGAGGACGACGCCTACTGCG CCGCCCCCTCCAGGGATGACCTGCTGCTC - 3 0 . All constructs were verified by sequence analysis , and one clone was stably transfected into Hep2 cells to create the Hep b TFAA cell line .

For siRNA transfection , 5 pmol ( Figs 2 and 3 ) or 20 pmol ( Figs 4 and 6 , Supplementary Fig S7 ) of siRNA was introduced by using Lipofectamine TM RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) in 0 . 5 × 10 5 Hep2 b cells ( Figs 2 and 3 ) or 1 . 5 × 10 6 Hep2 b cells ( Figs 4 and 6 ) . All siRNA - transfected cells were analy - sed 72 h after transfection , whereas plasmid - transfected cells were analysed 48 h after transfection . Endocytosis , immunofluorescence , FACS and microscopy Hep2 b were incubated with Tf coupled to AlexaFluor 488 ( TfA488 , Molecular Probes ) and anti - IL - 2R b ( 561 ) antibody coupled to cyanine 3 ( Cy3 ) for a time course up to 15 min at 37 ° C to allow receptor entry ( Grassart et al , 2010 ) . This monoclonal antibody , 561 , recognizes the extracellular part of IL - 2R b and does not affect the binding of the ligand IL - 2 nor the traffic of the receptor ( Subtil et al , 1994 ) . Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described in Grassart et al ( 2008 ) .

In parallel , to estimate the level of IL - 2R b / TfR expression at the cell surface , we incubated cells with 561 coupled to AlexaFluor647 ( Anti - IL - 2RA647 ) and TfA488 at 4 ° C for 1 h , washed and analysed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) . At least 5 , 000 cells were analysed in three different experiments . We normalized the surface expression in each condition to the control condition , ª 2015 The Authors The EMBO Journal Vol 34 | No 16 | 2015 Cyril Basquin et al Protrusion - based endocytosis of IL - 2 R The EMBO Journal 2157 Published online : June 29 , 2015 and these data were used to normalize our quantitative data of endocytosis ( see details in Supplementary Fig S5 ) . For endocytosis quantification , images were obtained with a 20 × objective under the same acquisition settings . Images collected from at least three inde - pendent experiments , representing at least 100 cells , were further analysed and quantified using Icy software as described ( Grassart et al , 2010 ; Basquin et al , 2013 ) . Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting Hep2 b or Hep2 b TFAA cells ( 4 × 10 6 ) transfected with plasmids and / or siRNA or with plasmids and / or then drug - pre - treated were lysed on ice - cold buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA and 1 % NP - 40 ) and centrifuged for 20 min at 15 , 000 g at 4 ° C to obtain the lysates . Lysates were incubated with either anti - GFP mouse antibody ( 4E6 ) or anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson Immuno - Research ) , washed and mixed with protein A - Sepharose TM CL - 4B ( GE Healthcare ) , and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer for 5 min , loaded on SDS - PAGE and analysed by Western blot ( WB ) . Antibodies ( Ab ) used for WBs were anti - Sra1 , anti - Wave2 and anti - Abi1 rabbit Ab ( Gautreau et al , 2004 ) , anti - GFP rabbit Ab ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - IL - 2R b rabbit Ab ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - dynamin mouse Ab ( Sigma Aldrich ) , anti - transferrin receptor mouse Ab clone H68 . 4 ( Life technologies ) , anti - clathrin heavy chain mouse antibody ( BD Transduction Laboratories ) and anti - flotillin2 mouse Ab ( BD Biosciences ) for loading controls . Secondary antibodies used were the enzyme horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) linked to anti - rabbit ( GE Healthcare ) and visualized by ECL , or alkaline phosphatase linked to anti - mouse , ( Pierce ) visualized by ECF and quantified by Storm FluoroImager . For all WBs , input represents 2 . 5 % of total lysate loaded on the gel . For Western blot quantification , the total intensity of each band was quantified using ImageJ and background was subtracted . For Supplementary Fig S6 , histograms represent the relative amount of IL - 2R co - immunoprecipitated to GFP - tagged protein compared to control cells ( considering 100 % of Co - IP in GFP - Brk1 - transfected control cells ) and normalized using the level of Sra1 or GFP immunoprecipitated ( mean made on three independent experiments (cid:1) SE , unpaired t - test ) . TIRF microscopy Hep2 b cells ( 3 × 10 5 ) , depleted or not for Dnm2 by siRNA treat - ment , were transfected with GFP - Abi , GFP - Brk1 , GFP - N - WASP or GFP - p16 and plated on MatTek plates . Then , cells were labelled during 2 min at 37 ° C with anti - IL - 2R b - Cy3 antibody in a TIRF medium ( 25 mM HEPES , 135 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 4 mM MgCl 2 , 4 . 5 g / l glucose and 0 . 5 % BSA , pH 7 . 4 ) and washed . Then , we incubated cells in an environmental control system set to 37 ° C and we imaged movies of 600 s at 0 . 5 Hz . Experiments were performed using a TIRF microscope ( IX81F - 3 , Olympus ) having a 100 × NA 1 . 45 Plan Apo TIRFM Objective ( Olympus ) and controlled by CellM ( Olympus ) . Two solid - state laser lines ( 561 and 488 nm ) ( Olympus ) were coupled to a TIRF condenser through two optical fibres . We acquired simultaneously the two colour channels through a Dual View beam splitter ( Optical Insights ) , which separates the two emission signals , with a dichroic mirror and emission filters ( Basquin et al , 2013 ) . Images were collected using an IxonEM + camera ( DU885 , Andor ) . Analysis of TIRF movies ( 10 per condition , five movies for Supplementary Fig S7 ) was performed using Icy software . Image analysis We performed the automated analysis of TIRF images with the open - source image analysis software Icy ( de Chaumont et al , 2012 ) ( http : / / icy . bioimageanalysis . org ) . Automatic detection of fluorescent spots We detected automatically the molecule fluorescent spots that are significantly brighter than the cell background with a wavelet - based detection algorithm implemented as a plugin ( Spot Detector plugin ) in Icy . Molecule tracking Due to the high density of molecule spots and the low signal to noise ratio leading to missing and false detections , standard Bayesian tracking algorithms fail to track robustly the different endocytic molecules . We thus developed a new tracking algorithm that exploits the confinement of endocytic molecules at the cell membrane during the IL - 2R endocytosis . In this algorithm , we first detect automatically the bright fluorescent molecule spots at each acquisition time ( see above ) . We then stack the obtained detec - tions and determine the positions of the putative endocytic events in the stacked image by detecting the very bright spots ( intensity > 40 × ( spot mean intensity ) ) . Indeed , we expect that molecules appear many times at these endocytic positions as they interact with IL - 2R during endocytosis . Conversely , molecules that are not confined and that diffuse freely at the cell membrane will not generate very bright spots in stacked image . Once we have obtained the positions of the putative endocytic events , we then reconstruct the endocytic tracks with a backtracking procedure : we associate the different detections to the nearest endocytic positions . To avoid the association of diffusing molecules with the endocytic tracks , we set a maximal association distance of 10 pixels . In addi - tion , when two detections can be potentially associated with the same track , we choose the closest . As different endocytic events can happen at the same position , we set a maximal time gap of 20 s ( 10 frames ) between two consecutive detections . Otherwise , we create two successive endocytic tracks at the same position . Our tracking algorithm is publicly available as an Icy plugin ( eTrack plugin ) . In total for each condition , 10 cells were imaged generating 10 movies and for each , between 100 and 150 IL - 2R tracks were obtained and analysed for co - localization ( at least 1 , 000 IL - 2R tracks analysed per condition ) . Co - localization analysis of tracks The analysis was done on at least 1 , 000 IL - 2R tracks per condition . First , we filtered shortest tracks ( < 4 s for all molecules or < 40 s for IL - 2R ) , and we determined co - localized tracks if at some time the centre of mass of the two tracks is inferior to 4 pixels . This led us to obtain the percentage of co - localized tracks of GFP - Abi1 ( WAVE ) , GFP - N - WASP or GFP - 16 ( Arp2 / 3 ) with IL - 2R tracks ( Fig 6E ) . In addition , we determined the time of recruitment of each track with respect to its co - localized IL - 2R - track and measured the duration of co - localization ( Figs 5H and 6G , Supplementary Fig S7E The EMBO Journal Vol 34 | No 16 | 2015 ª 2015 The Authors The EMBO Journal Protrusion - based endocytosis of IL - 2 R Cyril Basquin et al 2158 Published online : June 29 , 2015 and F ) . Finally , we quantified the fluorescence five frames before and five frames after the appearance / departure of each track , normalized the data upon max intensity of each track and exported into Excel file to draw the curve of intensities for WAVE , N - WASP , Arp2 / 3 and IL - 2R . We compared IL - 2R tracks of similar duration with the mean fluorescence intensity profiles of WAVE , N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 , time 0 being arbitrarily determined by the first protein recruited ( for Figs 5G and 6F mean of 10 tracks , for Supplementary Fig S7C and D mean of 5 tracks , (cid:1) SE ) . Cell preparation for electron microscopy analysis Hep2 b or Kit225 cells incubated on ice with DMEM containing 10 % FCS and 0 . 2 % BSA for 20 min . To label IL - 2R b , an antibody recognizing the extracellular part of the receptor ( 561 ( Subtil et al , 1994 ) ) was added for 20 min at 4 ° C and washed and cells were incubated with protein A coupled to 10 - nm gold beads at 4 ° C ( dilution 1 / 25 , Aurion ) , washed and further incubated for 7 or 12 min ( for Hep2 b ) and for 2 or 7 min ( for KitT225 ) at 37 ° C to allow endocytosis . To label transferrin ( Tf ) , Tf - 10 - nm gold conju - gate ( dilutions 1 / 50 or 1 / 100 , Cytodiagnostics ) was incubated with the cells at 4 ° C for 20 min , washed and further incubated at 37 ° C for 7 min . Cells were then fixed in 2 % glutaraldehyde ( Agar ) diluted in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer at pH 7 . 4 ( EMS ) . Cells were washed on ice with the same buffer and incubated for 1 h in 1 % osmium tetroxide ( EMS ) reduced with 1 . 5 % potassium ferro - cyanide ( Karnovsky , 1971 ) diluted in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate . Cells were dehydrated on ice through graded concentration of ethanol ( 50 – 70 – 96 – 100 % ) and infiltrated in epoxy resin ( Agar 100 resin kit , Agar ) at room temperature according to the manufac - turer’s instructions and polymerized for 48 h at 60 ° C . Kit225 cells were processed identically , except that cells were concentrated by pre - embedding them prior to dehydration with low melting - point agarose ( Promega ) . Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) Ultrathin sections ( 70 nm ) were cut with an ultramicrotome ( Ultra - cut , Leica Microsystems ) and collected on 200 - mesh copper grids ( Agar ) . For sectioning of adherent Hep2 b cells , their flat embed - ding allowed the collection of cell slices from the basal side and up to the first 800 nm from the coverslip . Sections were then stained with 2 . 5 % aqueous uranyl acetate ( Prolabo ) and 1 % lead citrate ( Agar ) before observation with a Zeiss 912 Omega TEM , JEM 1400 ( Jeol ) or Tecnai 12 ( FEI corp . ) microscope operation at 80 kV . Zeiss and Tecnai12 as well as JEM 1400 were equipped with side - mounted 2k × 2k Veleta ( Olympus ) and bottom - mounted Orius ( SC1000 , Gatan Inc . ) CCD cameras , respectively , and controlled with iTEM ( Olympus ) or Digital Micrograph ( Gatan ) softwares and subsequently processed with ImageJ , considering that IL - 2R b or CCP is close to a protrusion if distance is < 300 nm . CCPs were identified visually by the presence of the electron - dense coating of the membrane having a regular structure of about 100 nm in diameter . To quantify cell protrusion , micrographs of individual cells were acquired at low magnification . Protrusions were counted , and the ratio of protrusion number to membrane length was calculated and compared to control cells ( n = 30 ) . Electron tomography For electron tomographic analysis , two consecutive 150 - nm - thick sections were cut from trimmed Epon block that was prepared as for TEM analysis . Images were acquired with Tecnai FEG 20 ( FEI corp . ) operating at 200 kV equipped with 4k × 4k Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera ( Gatan Inc . ) using SerialEM software ( http : / / bio3d . colorado . edu / SerialEM / ) . Tilt series were collected over a tilt range of (cid:1) 62 ° with one - degree interval at nominal magnification of 14 , 500 × providing a 2 × binned pixel size of 1 . 53 nm . Gold particles of 10 nm in size were placed on top / below the sections to serve as fiducial markers ; however , all gold particles were erased from the images to reduce the artefacts cast by these markers in the reconstructions . The dual - axis tomograms were reconstructed using IMOD software package ( http : / / bio3d . colorado . edu / imod ) prior segmentation , modelling and visualization with Amira software ( FEI corp . ) .
