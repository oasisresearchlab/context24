Porter 1 Ismael Rafols 2 3 Abstract In the last two decades there have been studies claiming that science is becoming ever more interdisciplinary . However , the evidence has been anecdotal or partial . Here we investigate how the degree of interdisciplinarity has changed between 1975 and 2005 over six research domains . To do so , we compute well - established bibliometric indicators alongside a new index of interdisciplinarity ( Integration score , aka Rao - Stirling diversity ) and a science mapping visualization method . The results attest to notable changes in research practices over this 30 year period , namely major increases in number of cited disciplines and references per article ( both show about 50 % growth ) , and co - authors per article ( about 75 % growth ) . However , the new index of interdisciplinarity only shows a modest increase ( mostly around 5 % growth ) . Science maps hint that this is because the distribution of citations of an article remains mainly within neighboring disciplinary areas . These findings suggest that science is indeed becoming more interdisciplinary , but in small steps - - drawing mainly from neighboring fields and only modestly increasing the connections to distant cognitive areas . The combination of metrics and overlay science maps provides general benchmarks for future studies of interdisciplinary research characteristics . 1 Technology Policy and Assessment Center , Georgia Tech ; and Search Technology , Inc .

Introduction Interdisciplinary research seems almost universally acclaimed as “the way to go . ” Many believe that the great advances disproportionately take place at the interstices between disciplines , and that today’s research knowledge “knows no disciplinary boundaries . ” Or does it ? This paper both measures and maps cross - disciplinary research interchanges over time . We measure how integrative particular research articles are based on the association of the journals they cite to corresponding Subject Categories ( “ SCs ” ) of the Web of Science ( “ WoS ” ) . And , we present a practical way to map scientific outputs , again based on dispersion across SCs . We apply these measures and visualizations together to depict how six substantial research fields have changed from 1975 to 2005 . Collectively , these results help address our guiding questions : How interdisciplinary are different areas of science ? Are they becoming more interdisciplinary ? In 2003 , the US National Academy of Sciences , National Academy of Engineering , and Institute of Medicine launched the National Academies Keck Futures Initiative ( “ NAKFI ” ) to bolster interdisciplinary research in the US . This $ 40 million , 15 - year program needed to be able to measure interdisciplinarity in order to track its status and changes thereto . A National Academies study of Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research [ NATIONAL ACADEMIES , 2005 ] generally echoed the conventional wisdom that academia , with its staunch disciplinary roots , was not highly conducive to interdisciplinary research flourishing . This report operationally defined interdisciplinary research as : a mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates perspectives / concepts / theories and / or tools / techniques and / or information / data from two or more bodies of knowledge or research practice . The purpose of interdisciplinary research is to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single field of research practice . Examples of bodies of specialized knowledge or research practice include : low temperature physics , molecular biology , developmental psychology , toxicology , operations research , and fluid mechanics . Understood as knowledge integration , interdisciplinarity is not the opposite of specialization . research can be specialized ( i . e . focused on a narrow topic ) either within a disciplinary framework or drawing on various disciplines [ RAFOLS and MEYER , forthcoming ] . Our investigation here does not concern the degree of topic specialization of research but the degree that it relies on distinct disciplinary traditions . A key charge to the NAKFI evaluation team was to measure the degree of research interdisciplinarity , both at the macro ( e . g . , national ) and micro level ( e . g . , NAKFI participants in its seed grant programs on topics such as genomics or complexity ) . The evaluators compared perspectives to ascertain essential dimensions of interdisciplinary research [ PORTER ET AL . , 2006 ] . They concurred with the summation by MORILLO et al . [ 2001 ; 2003 ] that “we do not have appropriate indicators to measure interdisciplinarity . ” Our approach here is to investigate changes of degree of interdisciplinarity over time using various established indicators ( e . g . number of disciplines cited , percentage of citations within - field ) , together with a new indicator developed the NAKFI evaluation team [ PORTER et al . , 2007 ] : 4 Integration – reflecting the diversity of knowledge sources , as shown by the breadth of references cited by a paper . 4 A second indicator we presented in PORTER et al . [ 2007 ] reflects the diversity of disciplinary areas of publication , but that does not pertain to these analyses . The concept originally derives from LEAHEY [ 2006 ] . 3 Integration draws directly upon the above definition of interdisciplinary research . In addition to specifying integration of different knowledge sources , it allows for this to be accomplished by research teams or by individuals . It addresses “bodies of specialized knowledge or research practice , ” operationalized in the form of WoS Subject Categories , as the essential knowledge bases to be combined 5 . As per the preceding illustrations , these do not correspond closely to the nominal disciplines ( e . g . , chemistry , psychology ) . However , we later determined that Integration is a particular case of the Rao - Stirling index of diversity [ RAO , 1982 ] , which was presented as a general heuristic of diversity by STIRLING [ 2007 ] . Following Stirling’s heuristic , we have previously argued that in order to explore interdisciplinarity , one needs to investigate multiple aspects , namely : the number of disciplines cited ( variety ) , the distribution of citations among disciplines ( balance ) , and , crucially , how similar or dissimilar these categories are ( disparity ) [ RAFOLS and MEYER , forthcoming ] . The key novelty of this Integration score ( aka Rao - Stirling diversity index ) is that it captures not only the number of disciplines cited by a paper or their degree of concentration ( as Herfindahl or Shannon indices do ) , but also how disparate ( i . e . how different ) these disciplines are . In order to do so , it relies on a specific metric of distances ( or similarities ) between pairs of disciplines , as explained in previous papers [ PORTER et al . , 2007 ; RAFOLS and MEYER , forthcoming ] . Given that a measure of interdisciplinarity for a case is only meaningful in comparison to other fields or cases , the initial aim of this article is to provide benchmarks across different areas of science and at different times . To this purpose , we selected six Web of Science Subject Categories and examined their Integration indices , as well as other indicators pertaining to interdisciplinarity , over a 30 - year period , namely from 1975 to 2005 . The second and main aim of the paper is to use these benchmarks to investigate whether science is becoming more interdisciplinary - - as has been suggested by various studies , on different empirical bases ( GIBBONS et al . , 1994 ; HICKS and KATZ , 1996 ; BRAUN and SCHUBERT , 2003 ) . Although metrics provide a helpful perspective on the nature of research endeavors , they can be tremendously enriched through suitable visualizations . Therefore , we also present a visualization method that aims to convey the degree of Integration ( i . e . the diversity of knowledge sources ) via overlays on a map of science . Our findings suggest that although science is becoming more interdisciplinary , there are two sides to this growth . On the one hand , simple indicators of number of authors per paper and number of cited disciplines show a sustained and important increase ( above 50 % ) . On the other hand , in most fields , the new Integration score , in agreement with other sophisticated measures of diversity such as Shannon or Herfindahl index , show a more modest growth ( mostly around 5 % ) . The reason is that , although the total number of cited disciplines has increased , the distribution of citations occurs within neighboring areas and is only becoming a bit broader . This article is organized as follows . Section 2 explains the methods used in some details . Section 3 presents the main results of the interdisciplinarity measures and the mapping . Section 4 summarizes and discusses the findings . 2 . Methods 5 Our measures are based on the attribution of journals to ISI SCs in 2007 – hence they are not affected by previous changes in ISI categorization . 4 The computation and visualization of the interdisciplinarity measure has taken five steps , presented consecutively in this section : 1 . Operationalization of an interdisciplinary measure ( the Integration index or disciplinary diversity ) 2 . Construction of a similarity matrix among Subject Categories that is used to compute the Integration index 3 . Grouping via factor analysis of the SCs into macro - disciplines using the similarity matrix as a base to facilitate visualization 4 . Generating science maps 5 . Selection of a bibliometric sample of 6 SCs , to serve as benchmarks here and in future explorations . 2 . 1 . Definition of the Integration Score ( Disciplinary Diversity Index ) Although interdisciplinarity has been explored using various research attributes ( e . g . , research formulation , team processes , collaborations , research outputs , dispersion , and impact ) , the National Academies definition given above suggests that the key aspect to check whether interdisciplinarity has been achieved is whether the research outputs reflect knowledge integration . In other words , since knowledge integration is an epistemic category , indicators of interdisciplinarity should be based on the content of the research outcomes rather than on team membership , departmental affiliations , or collaborations ( see illustrations in case studies in RAFOLS AND MEYER , 2007 ) . Here , we focus on research publications , in particular , journal articles . After investigation of the options available , we settled upon Web of Science as our essential data resource . While recognizing limitations of that source , we appreciate its substantial coverage of science , engineering , and medicine ; its provision of citation information ; and its categorization of research areas into SCs that correspond to disciplines . These offer a granular view – quite consistent with the National Academies Committee definition of interdisciplinary research . Thomson Scientific’s Institute for Scientific Information ( ISI ) convenes editors who compose the SCs based on a combination of subject matter expert judgments and inter - journal citation patterns that , together , serve to cluster journals into topical groupings ( the SCs ) . The bibliometric community has noted that the SCs have some problems . In journal clustering exercises , only about 50 % of clusters were found to be closely aligned with SCs ( Boyack et al . , 2005 ; ( Boyack , personal communication , 14 September 2008 ) . Poor matching between SCs and classifications derived from citation networks has also been reported [ LEYDESDORFF , 2006 , p . 611 ] , but surprisingly the mismatch only has limited effect on the corresponding science maps [ RAFOLS and LEYDESDORFF , under review ] . Nonetheless , the SCs offer the most widely available categorization resource that we could ascertain for the purpose of providing an accessible measure of Integration . Note also that our categorization of articles is not based on individual article content analysis ; rather we associate the journal in which an article appears to the SC ( or SCs ) into which ISI places the journal . Over the past several years , we have been refining the NAKFI interdisciplinary metrics . The formulations have evolved somewhat , as detailed elsewhere [ PORTER et al . , 2008 ] . This paper addresses samples of journal articles , for which Integration is the salient metric . As derived in RAFOLS and MEYER [ forthcoming ] , the formula for the Integration index can be expressed as : j i j i ij p p s I , 1 where p i is the proportion of references citing the SC i in a given paper . The summation is taken over the cells of the SC x SC matrix . s ij is the cosine measure of similarity between SCs i and j ( the cosine measure may be understood as a variation of correlation ) . Here this matrix s ij is based on a US national co - citation sample of 30 , 261 papers from Web of Science as explained below in detail . 5 This Integration measure ( aka , Rao - Stirling’s diversity 6 ) can be compared with Shannon diversity : i i i p p S log Or with Herfindhal’s diversity ( the complement of Herfindahl’s concentration ) : ) ( , 2 1 j i j i i i j i p p p H The power of the Integration index is that it characterizes interdisciplinarity in terms of the diversity of knowledge sources of papers , using a general formulation of diversity ( STIRLING , 2007 ) rather than an ad hoc indicator . A number of researchers have used these traditional measures of diversity , such as Shannon or Herfindhal , to measure interdisciplinarity [ e . g . GRUPP , 1990 ; HAMILTON et al . , 2005 , or ADAMS et al . , 2007 ] . 7 These measures do not take into account how different the categories are , whereas our Integration measure reveals increased diversity only when added categories are significantly different . For instance , in agreement with Shannon and Herfindhal , an article that cites other articles that all appear in a single SC would have an Integration score of 0 . However only in our Integration score would an article that cites articles appearing in two SCs that were extremely similar also have a score close to zero . 2 . 2 . Construction of the Similarity Matrix among Subject Categories Over the past five years , we have been developing the interdisciplinary metrics . The empirical base on which the calculations are based has been growing . In particular , a broad national sample of articles from WoS is used to create the s ij matrix that underlies the metrics used for computing Integration . First we describe the sample used as a basis for the similarity matrix ; second , the construction of the matrix . We combine six separate weeks of all papers in WoS , with one or more authors having a USA address , sampled during 2005 - 07 , to obtain 30261 articles . 8 This provides a broadly based , yet manageable base sample . We processed the “Cited References” of these abstract records to identify the “Cited SCs . ” This poses challenges . These data come from WoS in somewhat varying formats . We use VantagePoint text mining software 9 to process the cited reference information as follows : Extract the source ( journal ) information from each Cited Reference text string 6 STIRLING ( 2007 ) proposed as a general diversity heuristic , where diversity indices can be explored for different valuations of the properties of diversity - - variety , balance and disparity in Stirling’s framework - - by changing the parameters and : j i j i ij p p s , , 1 Here we call Rao - Stirling diversity index the variant where and initially introduced by RAO [ 1982 ] . Notice that the Herfindhal index is a particular case for and ( the summation then is restricted to i , j for i ≠ j , since s ii = 1 by definition ) . For the particular case and the index returns the total number of categories - another basic measure of diversity . 7 ADAMS ET AL . [ 2007 ] examine interdisciplinarity for a sizable set of articles from two research universities , looking backward ( at cited references ) and forward ( to articles citing these ) . They employ three indices - proportion of citations outside source category , # of cited categories , and Shannon diversity index . They use a different set of 106 subject categories from Thomson ' s Current Contents ; these compare to those we use from WoS as somewhat less granular . They report strong correlation between subject category diversity ( Shannon index ) based on cited vs . citing articles . 8 We excluded the other 22 document types included in the sample of 44239 records ( e . g . , meeting abstracts , book reviews , editorials , reviews , letters ) . In particular , inclusion of reviews that may reference huge numbers of journal articles could alter co - citation - based relationships . 9 See www . theVantagePoint . com 6 Apply a Find - and - Replace thesaurus to consolidate alternative term forms within the journal titles ( e . g . , “American” and “Amer” and “Am” ) Apply a thesaurus that associates journals to SCs . 10 [ About 39 % of journals are associated with more than one SC . ] Check results and iteratively improve the matching thesauri . [ This has been done at least 6 times on portions of these data . ] The process captures a high percentage of the oft - cited journals . Our sample of 30261 WoS articles contains 1 , 020 , 528 cited references ( an average of 33 . 7 per article ) . Of those , our thesauri link 768 , 440 to a particular Subject Category . Another 28 , 000 have been checked and assigned to “not being in an SC . ” So , in terms of cited reference frequency , we are properly addressing almost 80 % of them . Our sample addresses all the SCs covered in WoS – i . e . , Science Citation Index , Social Science Citation Index , and Arts & Humanities Citation Index . That set evolves , so the number of SCs changes over time . For our purposes in addressing cited SCs , the list includes a few more than the current set , for a total of 244 SCs . The sample contains 1 , 114 , 930 instances of cited SCs . The range for individual SCs stretches from only 4 cites of articles published in journals associated with “Dance” to 78 , 148 cites associated with “Biochemistry and Molecular Biology . ” Our sample has at least 500 cites to 190 of the SCs ( 77 % ) ; it has at least 100 cites for 226 of the SCs ( 93 % ) . Generally , citation of each SC is substantial , except for many arts and humanities SCs that are infrequently cited . The 30261 articles , by 244 SCs , described allow for construction of a co - citation similarity matrix , s ij , using Salton cosine [ SALTON AND MCGILL , 1983 ; AHLGREN et al . , 2003 ] . To test the results obtained with this matrix , we have used a second similarity matrix , based on Salton’s cosine similarities between SCs using all the ISI data for 2007 , as detailed in LEYDESDORFF and RAFOLS ( 2008 ) . This procedure resembles that of the co - citation of SCs used by Moya et al . to generate a map of science [ MOYA et al . , 2004 ; 2007 ] . We considered adjusting for expectancies , but chose the widely used cosine measure for these large sample analyses [ KLAVANS and BOYACK , 2006 ] . The values of s ij are high ( i . e . closer to one ) when SCs i and j are co - cited by a high proportion of articles that cite one or the other . The cosine value approaches zero when two SCs are rarely cited together . That is , if articles often reference two SCs , say , “materials science , multidisciplinary” and “nanoscience & nanotechnology , ” there is a presumptive degree of association . 2 . 3 . Aggregation of SCs into Macro - disciplines For various purposes and in particular for visualization , it helps to consolidate the narrow research areas of the ISI SCs into larger categories , which we call “macro - disciplines . ” Since there is no established , widely accepted “best grouping , ” we determined to derive our own from observed relationships among the SCs based upon the s ij similarity matrix ( i . e . their co - citation in articles ) . We base our grouping of SCs on a type of factor analysis - - Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) - - following a similar methodology to that developed by LEYDESDORFF and RAFOLS ( 2008 ) to cluster SCs into macro - disciplines . Within VantagePoint , we constructed the matrix of cosine similarities for the 244 cited SCs by 244 cited SCs described in the previous section . That was exported to MS Excel and 10 Thomson Scientific’s Institute for Scientific Information ( ISI ) kindly provided the base thesaurus that listed 16036 journal entries ( for 10550 journals ) , showing full journal name , a 29 - character abbreviation , an 11 - character version , and the corresponding SC . WoS Cited References approximate the 29 - character version , but are not fully standardized . Over time as we run various analyses , we check for unmatched journals against name variations and in the Web of Knowledge Journal Citation Reports to enhance the J - SC thesaurus ( currently up to 27144 entries ) . 7 thence into SPSS . We explored various factor analysis solutions , eventually adopting a 20 - factor solution ( Varimax rotation ) . We located each SC on a single factor , that on which the SC loaded highest . In earlier explorations , we were tempted to fine - tune these assignments . However , in comparing factor solutions , we have come to believe the statistical assignments are at least as good as any refinements we might attempt . We compiled a 21 st “factor” of the SCs without substantial loading on any factor . These consisted of 8 “Literature” SCs and 8 additional “Arts” SCs ( e . g . , Theater , Medieval & Renaissance Studies , Poetry , Dance ) . The 21 macro - disciplines reflect this factor solution . 11 Appendix A gives the resulting assignment of Subject Categories to macro - disciplines . By and large , these are reasonably intuitive . That said , many individual SC assignments lead one to wonder about alternatives – might the SC load heavily as well upon another macro - discipline ? We examined the high and low loading SCs for each macro - discipline ( the Appendix lists SCs within macro - discipline in descending degree to which they relate to that factor ) . Indeed , some SCs do relate to more than one macro - discipline – e . g . , “Industrial Relations & Labor” loads 0 . 27 on “Industrial Engineering & Management Science , ” versus 0 . 24 on “Policy Sciences . ” Very few SCs show secondary loadings that would lead us to seriously consider reassignment . Given that , we retain the statistically based assignments of SCs to macro - disciplines . However , the readers should keep in mind these science maps contain areas of ambiguous attribution – and some of the macro - disciplines ( e . g . Reproductive Sciences ) are less robust groupings than are others . In naming , we placed emphasis on those SCs that load more highly on the given factor to best characterize that macro - discipline . Naming criteria were brevity ( to not unduly clutter the science maps ) and clarity , so that all would understand their thrust . Behavior of the SCs that include a traditional discipline in their name ( e . g . , “Chemistry , Analytical” ) is interesting . We were curious as to whether the seven such Chemistry SCs would form distinct factors ( i . e . , our macro - disciplines ) . They do generally coalesce , but not completely . For instance , 5 of the 7 Chemistry SCs consolidate in the macro - discipline which we name “Chemistry . ” Likewise , 5 of 8 Physics SCs load on the “Physics” factor ; and 6 of 11 Psychology SCs fall in “Cognitive Sciences . ” However , only 5 of 17 Engineering SCs group with “Engineering Sciences” ; the others divide among 6 other macro - disciplines . [ See Appendix A for details . ] So , to a considerable degree , named sub - disciplines do not fully coalesce within a single macro - discipline . This warns that the evolving research enterprise does not neatly conform to the traditional scholarly disciplines . So , as we measure degree of interdisciplinarity , reliance on traditional disciplinary labels is not necessarily the most valid approach . 2 . 4 . Science Mapping Approach Our science maps help one perceive the diversity of SCs on which a given set of publications draw . These maps present the SCs , their relative importance in size , and how related they are to each other over all science . The main aim of these science maps is to locate particular bodies of research among the macro - disciplines . Building on the overall science interrelationship representation ( as already develop by CHEN [ 2003 ] or BOYACK et al . [ 2005 ] ) among others , here we mainly seek a base upon which to situate particular research cases . That can help identify changes in degree of interrelationship over time , and key 11 To see whether additional structure was warranted for the arts and humanities , and to check the location of the social science SCs , we ran a supplemental sample of 4590 articles from the Arts and Humanities Citation Index ( AHCI ) . Various factoring solutions did not ascertain finer arts and humanities structuring or suggest significant relocation of particular SCs among the macro - disciplines ( factors ) . So , we retain a 21st “Literature & Arts” factor in our science map . 8 cross - “disciplinary” relationships that might benefit from nurturing . 12 It should also be informative to see whether knowledge sources of a set of publications are coming from research domains that are closely related ( little interdisciplinarity ) or that span very disparate domains ( high interdisciplinarity ) . These maps are constructed using the cosine similarity matrix s ij among SCs , then running factor analyses to find the macro - disciplines ( following , until this stage , the method used by LEYDESDORFF and RAFOLS ( 2008 ) . We then construct a new Salton cosine similarity matrix among SCs using the loadings of each SC on the 21 factors ( as discussed in the previous subsection ) . This matrix is then uploaded into the network analysis software Pajek ( BATAGELJ and MVAR , 2008 ) . In Pajek , the minimum similarity threshold was arbitrarily set to 0 . 6 ( this choice was found to provide a good readability - to - accuracy trade - off ) and the SCs were distributed in a 2 - D plane according to their similarities , to obtain a base science map . Finally , for each particular case , the proportions of citations of each SC , p i , are uploaded as a vector to represent the distribution of cited SCs for that case ( see RAFOLS and MEYER , forthcoming , for more details ) . Using only 21 factors [ see Footnote 10 ] , which explain 40 % of the variance , is a major simplification , but it was found to be the most effective way of achieving good readability in the 2 - D projections . As is always the case in 2 - D or 3 - D representations of highly multidimensional spaces , there is a trade - off between readability and accuracy . We are making the essential elements available on our websites to enable others to map their own cases over this base “science map . ” 2 . 5 . Sample Characterization We selected 6 of the 244 Subject Categories to benchmark research behavior . We sought to compare both across research fields ( the 6 SCs ) and over time ( sampling in 1975 , 1985 , 1995 , and 2005 ) . For each SC and year we gathered on average about 1000 articles ( the smallest and largest samples have 294 and 1910 articles respectively ) . The process of selecting this sample of 6 SCs involved many tradeoffs , but keyed on spanning US National Academies’ interests in science , engineering , and medicine . We initially studied 3 SCs , then expanded by another 3 to broaden coverage . The six selected SCs are : Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology [ Biotech ] Engineering , Electrical & Electronic [ EE ] Mathematics [ Math ] Medicine – Research & Experimental [ Medicine - R & E ] Neurosciences [ Neurosciences ] Physics – Atomic , Molecular & Chemical [ Physics - AMC ] We sought variety in terms of traditional vs . emergent , and basic vs . applied , research domains . Previously we have profiled 22 SCs [ PORTER et al . , 2008 ] . There , we had analyzed samples of about 100 papers published in 2005 , associated with the particular SC . We initially sought to replicate those analyses for other years , but decided that we wanted larger ( more robust ) article sample sets . In the process of choosing SCs for presumed diversity in research approach , we picked one that was not included in the set of 22 SCs – namely , Math . 3 . Results : Evolution of Interdisciplinarity in 6 Research Fields ( 1975 - 2005 ) How interdisciplinary is science ? In order to investigate this issue we analyze sets of articles representative of those published in journals associated with 6 WoS SCs , at 10 - year intervals . For each 12 For other analytical purposes it may be vital to examine relationships at the finer level of particular SCs . On our websites , we will provide individual SC labeling to aid in recovering such specifics from these maps . 9 set we compute multiple measures , each of them providing a perspective on interdisciplinarity . We key on the Integration score ( aka Rao - Stirling diversity ) , but want to examine it together with other basic indicators . Since interdisciplinarity is inherently multidimensional , examining a variety of perspectives ( indicators ) can both enrich and validate the new metric , Integration . In this section we first present the quantitative measures of interdisciplinarity and then explore how science mapping can help to illustrate these results . Further results of the analysis are available at Appendix B , posted on our websites . 3 . 1 Indicators of interdisciplinarity Citations within Subject Category Table 1 and Figure 1 present the percentage of Citations within SC for each of the six SCs under study . This indicator partially captures one of the aspects of diversity – namely the balance in the distribution of citations . Note that the size of SCs varies greatly . Physics - AMC contains only 32 journals as of the 2007 Journal Citation Reports , whereas EE contains 227 . 13 Interestingly , the percentage of citations to journals within the article’s own SC is not a simple function of SC size . For instance , note that the tiny SC , Physics - AMC , is quite inclined to reference articles published in Physics - AMC journals . Its concentration in 2005 is quite similar to that for two huge SCs - - EE and Neurosciences . Two of these six SCs might be deemed “undisciplines” – i . e . , those drawing relatively little on prior work published in their own SC . Those two , Biotech and Medicine - R & E , are of moderate size . Math provides another point of contrast . It behaves the most like one might have anticipated a strong “discipline” to do , primarily citing research published in Math journals . The Math SC contains a lot of journals , but so do EE and Neurosciences ( Table 1 ) . Table 1 . Percentage of Citations Within Subject Category Biotech EE Math Medicine - - R & E Neurosciences Physics - AMC # Journals SC , 2007 138 227 207 81 211 32 % of Cited SC Instances within SC , 1975 14 . 0 % 25 . 9 % 79 . 1 % 15 . 0 % 24 . 8 % 44 . 2 % % of Cited SC Instances within SC , 2005 11 . 0 % 29 . 1 % 69 . 1 % 9 . 3 % 30 . 3 % 28 . 0 % 13 This recent value is the pertinent size to consider here as we used a currently derived thesaurus to associate journals to Subject Categories . 10 Figure 1 . Percentage of Citations Within Field Table 2 presents essential empirical results concerning research published in journals associated with the six SCs from 1975 through 2005 . In the following paragraphs and figures we will focus on each of the measures . Indicators of collaboration Since research collaboration is often ( and sometimes mistakenly ) associated with interdisciplinarity , we examine measures of co - authorship . Figure 2 shows the number of authors per paper . This varies notably by field , with Math the stingiest and Medicine - R & E the most generous . The ordering by fields remains quite steady across these three decades . However , within research domain , the number of authors per paper has escalated remarkably , with about 75 % average growth . This increase ranges from 48 % in Math and 54 % in Physics - AMC to 90 % in Neurosciences . ABT ( 2007a ) notes that many have observed the increase in number of authors per paper over time . He gathers data from 64 leading journals in 16 Journal Citation Reports categories ( these don’t map directly to the WoS SCs ) for 2004 . He finds an average of 5 . 5 authors per paper , ranging from 2 . 8 in Math to 9 . 4 in Physics . He also finds the percentage of single - authored papers to average 6 . 6 % , with Math , Physics , and Astronomy the only categories averaging over 10 % . In another paper ( ABT , 2007b ) compiled data on single - authored papers in four fields over the period , 1975 - 2005 . For astronomy , the drop over this period ( averaged for four important journals ) was from 44 % to 10 % ; in physics and in biology , from about 40 % to just under 20 % . Chemistry drops from about 12 % to 4 % . Our results reinforce his with somewhat more encompassing datasets . The message is clear – norms vary by field , but all show a tendency toward increased collaboration . 11 Table 2 .

Within that range , the size reflects convenience in data downloading from WoS . For extremely large article sets , we developed a sampling frame ; for moderate article sets , we downloaded them all . We then processed the downloaded set using a special macro ( programmed routine ) to calculate Integration for each article semi - automatically using VantagePoint . 12 Figure 2 . Number of Authors per Paper over Time A closely related statistic tells a similar story – Figure 3 shows the decline in single - authorship . Even as long ago as 1975 in most of these fields , single - authored papers were relatively rare . 14 Math was a strong exception and EE also evidenced a lot of individual research . In all of these SCs , except Math , single - authored articles now constitute fewer than 10 % of the WoS publications . The results support the view that publishing in teams ( co - authoring ) is now the dominant form of research . However , as we will see , this increase in working in teams should not be equated with interdisciplinarity . 15 14 These figures can be compared with the time series of single authorship over all fields from 1900 to 1960 by PRICE ( 1986 ) and more recently by HICKS & KATZ ( 1996 , p . 392 ) . 15 Moreover , we have to keep in mind that co - authorships are the result of very different types of collaboration practices ( agreements between labs , recruitment , materials or facilities support , etc . ) leading to publication co - authorship , and that not all forms collaboration not captured by co - authorship ( CRONIN , 2001 ; GLANZEL , 2002 ; LAUDEL , 2002 ; RAFOLS , 2007 ) . 13 Figure 3 . Single - authored Papers over Time Number of Cited Subject Categories Before turning to Integration scores , we consider the number of distinct SCs that one article cites . This is a relatively raw measure , but one that should correlate somewhat with Integration . Table 2 and Figure 4 show a sturdy increase in the breadth of citing in all six of these research domains ( about a 50 % growth on average ) . As indicated in Table 1 , care should be taken in directly comparing such citation behavior across SCs because they differ in size of their journal pool . Nevertheless , journal pool size alone does not account for the wide variation in researcher outreach to knowledge from other SCs . EE , Math , and Neurosciences are similar in journal set size ( all very large ) . But , the average Math article published in 2005 cites only 3 SCs ( presumably often including itself ) ; the EE article , 6 ; and the Neurosciences article , 13 SCs . Since the linking of a publication ( journal ) to an SC is based on a recently constructed thesaurus , temporal comparison is not inherently clouded by changes in SC inclusivity over time . Nonetheless , a number of potentially confounding factors caution against easy conclusion of increasing interdisciplinarity . For instance , publication norms encouraging more referencing ( see Table 2 ) are strongly evidenced from 1975 - 2005 for all six fields . 14 Figure 4 . Change in Number of Subject Categories Cited , over Time Integration Score Integration scores are tabulated in Table 2 and shown in Figure 5 . We see that over time , there is a modest increase in Integration scores and that math researchers are notably less integrative in their citing patterns . However , math has the highest relative growth ( 39 % ) whereas other SCs’ growth ranges from 3 % to 14 % ( 5 % on average ) . t - tests between the 1975 and 2005 samples show these differences to be highly significant ( < . 005 for EE , assuming either equal or unequal variances ; all others even more highly significant ) . One - way analyses of variance for the two series for which differences among the four samples appear more questionable ( EE and Neurosciences ) yield F statistics significant at < . 001 . In order to better understand the Integration score , we compared it with the more traditional Shannon and Herfindhal indicators of diversity ( see the methods section for the equations ) . Pearson’s correlation between Integration and Herfindhal takes a mean value of 0 . 91 ( standard deviation = 0 . 07 ) and between Integration and Shannon , a mean value of 0 . 88 ( standard deviation = 0 . 07 ) . 16 These high correlations confirm that Integration is very closely associated with traditional diversity indicators – as could be expected by construction . 17 16 The correlation between Herfindahl and Shannon is 0 . 94 with standard deviation = 0 . 02 . 17 These integration scores were generated using the similarity matrix between SCs introduced in the methods ( based on samples of 30000 ) . We have checked that very similar results were obtained with a different similarity matrix based on all the ISI database , computed for 2007 following the LEYDESDORFF and RAFOLS [ 2008 ] methodology . Using this other matrix , which has higher s ij values , most integration scores take values between 0 . 35 and 0 . 45 . Notably , the correlation with Herfindahl and Shannon indices drop to a 0 . 5 - 0 . 8 range – particularly for the most integrative SCs , such as Neurosciences . This empirical result supports the theoretical expectation that corrections to traditional diversity indicators will be most important in research areas where there are major overlaps among SCs ( e . g . , more important in biomedical sciences than in math ) . 15 Figure 5 . Change in Integration Scores over Time The main finding is that Integration scores increase over time , but significantly less so than other indicators , such as percentage of singleauthored papers , mean authors per paper , and mean number of disciplines per paper . Why is this ? We believe there are three compounded reasons : First , although the number of cited SCs increases significantly , since the average number of references in a paper also shows a quicker increase ( see central columns in Table 2 ) , the actual change in the proportions of citation to different SCs is not as important as could be expected . In other words , although there are more SCs cited in 2005 than in 1975 , the proportions contributed by the newly cited SCs are rather small . 18 We believe that this is the reason for the slight decrease in Integration scores in 1995 for Neurosciences , EE and Biotech . Second , as we will show in Figures 7 through 10 , the citation patterns of a given SC tend to be with SCs in its vicinity . Since these neighboring SCs have high similarity values with the one investigated , their contribution to Integration ( to diversity ) is smaller than in other indicators . This means that the Integration score “deflates” the diversity recorded by Shannon or Herfindahl because most of the cited SCs are not very different from the SC doing the citing . 19 18 This observation is corroborated by the fact that the Shannon index ( which gives higher weight to smaller proportions than the Integration score or Herfindahl ) , shows a slightly more pronounced increase of diversity over time ( data not presented ) . 19 An examination of the matrix , s ij ( to be posted on our website ) shows that most of the values are close to 0 – which explains why the correction of Shannon or Herfindahl values has been smaller than initially expected . In the current formulation this matrix does not seem to make enough difference between SCs which are slightly related ( e . g . Astronomy vs mathematical physics s ij = 0 . 012 ) and SCs which are unrelated ( e . g . Astronomy and Physiology sij = 0 . 003 ) . For example , consider the changes seen between 1975 ( Figure 7 ) and 2005 ( Figure 8 ) of the distributions of the least cited SCs by Biotech in the map of science ( e . g . , the appearance in 2005 of a small but 16 Finally , but possibly less important , diversity indicators such as Shannon and Herfindhal ( i . e . including our Integration score ) have a saturation effect : an increase from 8 . 9 to 13 . 4 cited SCs ( as in Neurosciences ) has much less weight than an increase from 2 . 2 to 3 . 2 SCs ( as in Math ) . Diversity is viewed as increasing proportionately more in the second case . This may explain why the increase of Integration score for Math is more prominent than for the other SCs analyzed . Hence , the main conclusion of the reading of the trend in Integration scores , as presented in Figure 5 , is that we should be cautious regarding the increase of interdisciplinarity . Yes , there is an increase in the number of disciplines cited , but their relative increase , the proportion of the newly cited disciplines , and their degree of disparity are not as large as suggested by previous indicators . 3 . 2 . Mapping of disciplinary diversity Indicators of interdisciplinarity provide us a guide regarding the trend in interdisciplinarity of a given SC , but they do not provide details regarding the areas on which this SC draws . This is much easier to convey using science maps that directly show the three aspects of disciplinary diversity , namely : ( i ) the variety of “disciplines” ( i . e . , discrete research areas , the SCs , shown by the number of nodes in the map ) ( ii ) the balance , or distribution , of disciplines ( relative size of nodes ) ( iii ) the disparity , or degree of difference , between the disciplines ( distance between the nodes ) As explained in the methodology , the cosine similarity matrix among SCs allows us to construct a map of science , as shown in Figure 6 , which aims to represent in a 2 - dimensional space how similar the SCs are . For example , it conveys in an intuitive way that Materials Sciences are closely associated with Physics ; indirectly connected to Ecological Science via Chemistry , and to Environmental Sciences ; but very distant from Clinical Medicine . However , since this is 2 - dimensional representation ( a reduction of 242 dimensions for the set of SCs ! ) , it fails to show that there is one SC , namely Biomaterials , that lies in the Clinical Medicine area ( as shown from the factor analysis ) , but has a strong connection with Materials Sciences . These maps were created followed the techniques developed in LEYDESDORFF and RAFOLS ( 2008 ) , in the context of the current interest in science mapping ( MOYA - ANEGON et al . , 2004 ; BOYACK et al . , 2005 ; MOYA - ANEGON et al . , 2007 ) . We have recently verified that for a given methodology of visualization , the maps are surprisingly robust to very different categorizations ( RAFOLS and LEYDESDORFF , under review ) . In the figures presented in this article , we only label groups of SCs on the basis of macro - disciplines found by factor analysis , as explained in the methodology . However , the same maps with detailed labeling of each SC will be found on our websites ( which will also include an open KIT for the construction of maps with other data ) . 20 significant contribution from Materials Sciences and Mathematics not present in 1975 ) . The fact that the Integration score cannot fully capture these differences points to the need for re - framing our understanding the exploration of these indices as “heuristics” to make manifest different aspects of diversity , rather than aiming at self - contained , black - box indicators . See STIRLING , 2007 , and RAFOLS and MEYER [ forthcoming ] , for a discussion of the “heuristics” approach . 20 See www . sussex . ac . uk / spru / irafols and http : / / tpac . gatech . edu / . 17 Figure 6 .

The size ( area ) of nodes is proportional to the number of citations to a given SC by articles in the Biotech SC . The maps illustrate how Biotech research has changed over three decades : The Biotech SC is located in the Biomedical Sciences macro - discipline ( see Appendix A for the full macro - discipline names in case the shorthand names need explanation ) . The heavy concentration of citations by Biotech papers is on Biomedical Science SCs in 1975 and in 2005 . Several nearby macro - disciplines are cited to a considerable degree , as well , in both years . Macro - disciplines increasingly cited in 2005 include : Ecol Sci ; Math , Interdisciplinary ; Clinical Med , Reproductive Sci – perhaps suggesting that Biotech is becoming increasingly useful in clinical applications . Materials Science areas show up in 2005 – it could prove interesting to explore what is taking place at the intersection of Biotech and Materials Sciences . The Computer Sciences appearing in 2005 may reflect the advent of bioinformatics , which did not exist in 1975 . 18 Figure 7 .

Figure 9 helps us to “see” why the factor analysis locates EE with Computer Science instead of Engineering Sciences ( as one might have expected ) : most of its citations fall in the former rather than the latter . The strong secondary concentration in Materials Science stands forth boldly as well . Some of the SCs that EE - 2005 cites highly from this macro - discipline are : Physics , Applied ; Materials Science , Multidisciplinary ; Physics , Condensed Matter ; and Nanoscience & Nanotechnology . In addition we see heavy citing of the Physics macro - discipline . Math is by far the most monodisciplinary of these six SCs . It is clear that Math research draws primarily upon prior Math research . Most intriguing is to see the macro - disciplines to which the highly cited SCs have been assigned . Math itself is located in the macro - discipline ( PCA factor ) that we named Industrial Engineering / Management Science . “Mathematics , Applied” is located in the Engineering Sciences macro - discipline , 21 while “Physics , Mathematical” lies in Physics . Other SCs on which Math draws heavily are quite dispersed . Here , we are using the science overlay maps mainly to enrich understanding of the interdisciplinarity metrics . We believe that these visualization tools can be used for a variety of purposes , including research profiling , identification of new methods and findings ( “science intelligence” ) , and research evaluation . Further details and analyses of the other SCs investigated here are provided in Appendix B , to be posted on our websites . 4 . Discussion and Conclusions In this article we have investigated how the degree of interdisciplinarity has changed between 1975 and 2005 for six research domains , including both long - established ( e . g . , Math ) and relatively newly formed ones ( e . g . , Neurosciences ) . In so doing , we compute both widely used indicators of interdisciplinarity and a new index of diversity ( Rao - Stirling index or Integration score ) that we have developed recently [ PORTER et al . , 2007 ; RAFOLS and MEYER , forthcoming ] , and provide a visualization method based on overlay science maps [ LEYDESDORFF and RAFOLS , 2008 ] . We believe that the combination of interdisciplinarity metrics with science mapping enables us to characterize and track research interdisciplinarity with a detail not previously available . The Integration score proposed not only takes into account the number of disciplines and their distribution , but it incorporates a measure of how distant the knowledge sources are ( in this instance in terms of WoS SCs ) . To “deflate” the counting of disciplines including distance is very important because most classifications of science ( and particularly the most widely used , i . e . , the SCs from the WoS ) have many categories strongly intersecting with each other [ RAFOLS and LEYDESDORFF , under review ] – which leads to an overstatement of the degree of interdisciplinarity . This is apparent in the maps of science , when different categories “pile up” in the same region . The results on profiles of research articles in six SCs over the period , 1975 - 2005 , attest to notable changes in how research is conducted . Particularly striking is the extent to which research is now a team effort . In 21 Checking the factor solution , we see that “Mathematics , Applied” is strongly related to four of the Macro - disciplines : Engineering Sciences ( loading 0 . 52 ) , Computer Science ( 0 . 32 ) , Physics ( 0 . 18 ) and Math , Interdisciplinary ( 0 . 16 ) . 21 all of these SCs , except Math , single - authored articles now constitute fewer than 10 % of the WoS publications in 2005 . Research papers in 2005 cite many more references ( more than 50 % growth , on average ) , and these draw upon about 50 % more SCs than did counterpart papers in 1975 . The average number of cited SCs per article is very dependent on the SC doing the citing – from averages of only 2 or 3 in Math to 13 in Neurosciences . From this perspective , the measures of interdisciplinarity indicate considerably greater interchange of research knowledge than many of us anticipated . Except for certain disciplines , such as Math , by no means is modern research knowledge exchange restricted within narrow silos . 22 However , the perspective provided by the Integration score and the science maps suggests that the practice of interdisciplinarity in citations occurs mainly between neighboring SCs and has undergone a much more modest increase ( on average only 5 % , excluding math ) . This is mainly for two reasons : first , although the number of cited SCs has increased , the growth of citations means that the increase in the proportion of citations to new SCs is small ; second , the newly cited SCs tend to be in the vicinity of the previous ones – hence they don’t add as much interdisciplinarity as they would if they were very disparate / distant disciplines . Moreover , for already very interdisciplinary SCs , such as Neuroscience , the indicator may have a certain “saturation” effect . In summary , science is indeed becoming more interdisciplinary , but in small steps . Research knowledge transfer , as evidenced by citation , draws mainly on neighboring fields . Only slowly do we see increase in the small proportion of sources from more disparate disciplines . The study of the six research domains examined here is not only interesting on its own right to track the evolution of interdisciplinarity over time , but it also provides essential benchmarks for future investigations . By giving these profiles of cited SCs , Integration scores , and other indicators for six SCs representing quite diverse scientific areas , we ( and hopefully other researchers ) can build upon these results to investigate interdisciplinary practices for specific research topics , scientific communities , or organizations . For instance , NAKFI can compare the research of attendees at its conferences to these benchmark SCs . These benchmarks and the maps will serve both the aims of research intelligence ( e . g . , “surmising” possible cognitive complementarities ) and evaluation ( e . g . , to monitor whether their research practices change as a result of a policy initiative such as NAKFI ) . 22 This result should not be interpreted as meaning that researchers are not specialized . It suggests that most publications cite various and increasingly more disciplines , although they are possibly specialized in terms of topic ( an issue we have not covered here – see PORTER et al . [ 2007 ] and RAFOLS and MEYER [ forthcoming ] on indicators of specialization ) . 22 References ABT , H . A . ( 2007a ) The frequencies of multinational papers in various sciences .

The macro - disciplines have been generated by Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) applied to co - citation data for a large sample of articles from Web of Science . The process is described in Section 2 . 3 . The SCs are ordered within macro - discipline in this listing according to the strength of their loading on that PCA factor . 26 Health Sci PUBLIC , ENVIRONMENTAL & OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH HEALTH POLICY & SERVICES Ind Engr / Mgt Sci MANAGEMENT HEALTH CARE SCIENCES & SERVICES BUSINESS MEDICINE , GENERAL & INTERNAL OPERATIONS RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT SCIENCE NURSING ENGINEERING , INDUSTRIAL GERONTOLOGY ENGINEERING , MANUFACTURING GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY MATHEMATICS SUBSTANCE ABUSE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS & LABOR PEDIATRICS EDUCATION , SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES Cognitive Sci PSYCHOLOGY NUTRITION & DIETETICS PSYCHOLOGY , EXPERIMENTAL INTEGRATIVE & COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE PSYCHOLOGY , BIOLOGICAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES Ecol Sci ECOLOGY NEUROSCIENCES BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PSYCHOLOGY , MULTIDISCIPLINARY ZOOLOGY PSYCHIATRY EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY PSYCHOLOGY , CLINICAL BIOLOGY LINGUISTICS ORNITHOLOGY NEUROIMAGING ENTOMOLOGY LANGUAGE & LINGUISTICS ANTHROPOLOGY CLINICAL NEUROLOGY OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY Env Sci & Tech ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES MUSIC WATER RESOURCES PSYCHOLOGY , PSYCHOANALYSIS LIMNOLOGY ENGINEERING , ENVIRONMENTAL Soc / Psych & Rltd FAMILY STUDIES MARINE & FRESHWATER BIOLOGY PSYCHOLOGY , SOCIAL OCEANOGRAPHY SOCIAL WORK METEOROLOGY & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES SOCIOLOGY FISHERIES SOCIAL SCIENCES , INTERDISCIPLINARY AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING PSYCHOLOGY , DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICOLOGY WOMEN ' S STUDIES ENGINEERING , OCEAN PSYCHOLOGY , APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY , EDUCATIONAL Agri Sci AGRICULTURE , MULTIDISCIPLINARY CRIMINOLOGY & PENOLOGY FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY RELIGION CHEMISTRY , APPLIED EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AGRONOMY DEMOGRAPHY PLANT SCIENCES COMMUNICATION HORTICULTURE ETHNIC STUDIES SOIL SCIENCE LAW FORESTRY FILM , RADIO , TELEVISION AGRICULTURE , DAIRY & ANIMAL SCIENCE EDUCATION , SPECIAL MYCOLOGY MATERIALS SCIENCE , PAPER & WOOD Policy Sci PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT MATERIALS SCIENCE , TEXTILES ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES URBAN STUDIES Geosciences GEOSCIENCES , MULTIDISCIPLINARY ECONOMICS GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY GEOCHEMISTRY & GEOPHYSICS AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS & POLICY GEOGRAPHY , PHYSICAL AREA STUDIES PALEONTOLOGY POLITICAL SCIENCE MINERALOGY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ENGINEERING , PETROLEUM BUSINESS , FINANCE REMOTE SENSING PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IMAGING SCIENCE & PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY HISTORY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES ARCHAEOLOGY HISTORY ARCHITECTURE 27 Chemistry CHEMISTRY , MULTIDISCIPLINARY CHEMISTRY , ORGANIC Ethical & Social Issues MEDICAL ETHICS CHEMISTRY , INORGANIC & NUCLEAR ETHICS CHEMISTRY , MEDICINAL SOCIAL SCIENCES , BIOMEDICAL BIOCHEMICAL RESEARCH METHODS SOCIAL ISSUES BIOPHYSICS MEDICINE , LEGAL CHEMISTRY , ANALYTICAL PHILOSOPHY CRYSTALLOGRAPHY HISTORY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE PHYSICS , ATOMIC , MOLECULAR & CHEMICAL Literature & Arts LITERATURE , BRITISH ISLES Physics PHYSICS , MULTIDISCIPLINARY THEATER PHYSICS , PARTICLES & FIELDS LITERARY THEORY & CRITICISM PHYSICS , NUCLEAR LITERARY REVIEWS NUCLEAR SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY HUMANITIES , MULTIDISCIPLINARY INSTRUMENTS & INSTRUMENTATION LITERATURE , ROMANCE PHYSICS , MATHEMATICAL MEDIEVAL & RENAISSANCE STUDIES SPECTROSCOPY LITERATURE PHYSICS , FLUIDS & PLASMAS LITERATURE , AFRICAN , AUSTRALIAN , CANADIAN OPTICS ASIAN STUDIES MINING & MINERAL PROCESSING LITERATURE , AMERICAN ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS ART DANCE LITERATURE , GERMAN , DUTCH , SCANDINAVIAN FOLKLORE CLASSICS POETRY SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS – To be provided on our websites : www . sussex . ac . uk / spru / irafols and http : / / tpac . gatech . edu / Appendix B .
