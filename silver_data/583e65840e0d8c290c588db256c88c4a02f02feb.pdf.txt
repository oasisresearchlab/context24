Simon Organic electronic ion pumps ( OEIPs ) have been used for delivery of biological signaling compounds , at high spatiotemporal resolution , to a variety of biological targets . The miniaturization of this technology pro - vides several advantages , ranging from better spatiotemporal control of delivery to reduced invasiveness for implanted OEIPs . One route to miniaturization is to develop OEIPs based on glass capillary fibers that are filled with a polyelectrolyte ( cation exchange membrane , CEM ) . These devices can be easily inserted and brought into close proximity to targeted cells and tissues and could be considered as a starting point for other fiber - based OEIP and “ iontronic ” technologies enabling favorable implantable device geometries . While characterizing capillary OEIPs we observed deviations from the typical linear current – voltage behav - ior . Here we report a systematic investigation of these irregularities by performing experimental character - izations in combination with computational modelling . The cause of the observed irregularities is due to concentration polarization established at the OEIP inlet , which in turn causes electric field - enhanced water dissociation at the inlet . Water dissociation generates protons and is typically problematic for many applica - tions . By adding an ion - selective cap that separates the inlet from the source reservoir this effect is then , to a large extent , suppressed . By increasing the surface area of the inlet with the addition of the cap , the con - centration polarization is reduced which thereby allows for significantly higher delivery rates . These results demonstrate a useful approach to optimize transport and delivery of therapeutic substances at low con - centrations via miniaturized electrophoretic delivery devices , thus considerably broadening the opportuni - ties for implantable OEIP applications . Introduction Organic bioelectronics is unique as the translator of signals between biology and technology , and is a promising techno - logical solution to a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic challanges . 1 – 4 Biosensing , 5 – 7 electrophysiological recording 8 and drug delivery systems 9 – 11 based on organic electronic ma - terials have been demonstrated to record and regulate biologi - cal functions that previously have been very difficult , or even impossible , to achieve with pharmaceutical or traditional ( bio ) electronic techniques . 12 , 13 “ Iontronics ” is the subfield of or - ganic bioelectronics that combines electronic and ionic prop - erties of organic electronics . 14 – 16 It is therefore uniquely suited for biological applications where ionic ( biochemical ) signals can be triggered , released , and addressed electronically . The fundamental component of iontronics is the organic electronic ion pump ( OEIP ) , an electrophoretic delivery device that can be considered an iontronic resistor . 17 – 19 OEIPs and other simi - lar iontronic devices are based on transporting , or “ pumping ” , charged species through cation - or anion - exchange mem - branes ( CEMs or AEMs ) , resulting in high spatiotemporal de - livery resolution , high dosage precision ( ideally one electron per delivered monovalent ion ) , and , unlike analogous microfluidics - based techniques , there is ideally no liquid flow accompanied with the actual compound delivery . 14 OEIP tech - nology has been used to trigger cell signaling in vitro , 1 , 20 to control epileptiform activity in brain slice models , 21 – 23 to effect sensory function in vivo , 19 as e - therapy for pain in awake ani - mals , 17 and even to modulate plant growth via phytohormone delivery . 24 Traditionally , the bioelectronics demonstrations of OEIP technology have required photolithographic techniques on planar substrates to sequentially pattern active and passive areas . However , for implantation scenarios , this design faces some scale and rigidity limitations along with issues related to invasiveness ( planar substrates / geometry and flexibility ) . To address the need for OEIP technology which overcomes the previous limitations , we demonstrate OEIPs devices based on glass capillary fibers that are filled with an anionic polyelectro - lyte ( CEM ) ( Fig . 1A and B ) . Capillary fibers offer several design advantages for use with implantable OEIP devices .

This is due to less swelling occur - ring perpendicular to the substrate for narrower channels , as compared to wider ones , thus providing less water uptake in - side the IEM which is necessary to promote high ionic conduc - tivity ( Fig . 1C ) . 17 Fiber capillary OEIPs provide a larger ion - transport cross - section , as compared to a thin narrow channel manufactured using thin film processing , thus the capillary OEIPs facilitates transport of larger ions such as drugs and neu - rotransmitters . In addition , the capillary pipe simultaneously serves as both encapsulation and substrate for the OEIP channel ( Fig . 1C ) . Such devices , assuming a narrow outer diameter , can easily be inserted and brought into close proximity to targeted cells , tissues , and organs – particularly in vivo – and could be considered as a starting point for other fiber - based OEIP tech - nologies enabling favorable implantable device geometries . OEIPs are based on the selective transport of charged spe - cies through CEMs ( i . e . , anion selective membranes ) . CEMs are characterized by a high concentration of fixed negative charges and the permselectivity holds if the ionic concentra - tions in the adjacent electrolytes are lower than the fixed charge concentration of the CEM ( Donnan exclusion ) . 25 The ionic current through the membrane is represented by the combination of migration controlled by the electric field and diffusion along concentration gradients , with diffusion most noticeable when no potential is applied . The current through the OEIP is driven by electrochemical electrode reactions in the source and target reservoirs . In this work Ag / AgCl paste electrodes were used which operate according to eqn ( 1 ) . AgCl ( s ) + e − ↔ Ag ( s ) + Cl − ( 1 ) The capacity of the Ag / AgCl electrodes was measured in a three - electrode setup by chronopotentiometry and calculated from C = I Δ t , where I is the constant charging current ( 100 Fig . 1 A ) Experimental setup and schematic illustration of CEM and geometries .

S1 † ) . The Ag / AgCl electrode capacity was ≈ 200 mC , which was much higher than the transported charge in the OEIP experiments ( ≈ 3 mC ) . During delivery , high concentrations of ions are accumu - lated at the release site resulting in a steep concentration gra - dient . Concentration polarization refers to the emergence of concentration gradients at the interface between the CEM and an electrolyte as an electric current pass through the sys - tem . The transport rate of ions depends on the value of elec - tric current flowing through the membrane . For CEMs , the electrolyte concentration decreases in the close vicinity to the membrane on the side where cations enter into the channel , i . e . the feeding or source side , since the electric field , close to the inlet , forces cations into and anions away from the mem - brane inlet . At the other side of the membrane , cations es - cape the membrane outlet , and anions migrate toward the membrane , thus the electrolyte concentration is increased at this side of the OEIP . The resulting electric ( ionic ) current ( I ) typically increases linearly with voltage ( V ) at low voltages according to Ohm ' s law , until the concentration drops to zero at the inlet side due to concentration polarization , and the point of limiting current of the system is reached . 26 , 27 According to the classic theory of concentration polarization , as the current density increases , the concentration of the ions on the feeding side ( fiber inlet ) of the membrane drops and approaches zero at the very interface , and then forms a space - charge region ( SCR ) ( Fig . 1D ) . Meanwhile , the concen - tration increases on the opposite side ( fiber outlet ) ( Fig . 1D ) due to the membrane selectivity . For current levels above the limiting current , an additional potential loss is introduced . 28 The electric field at the inlet increases sharply as a result of ion depletion and causes electric field - enhanced water split - ting , which then generates protons and hydroxide ions along the inlet interface . 29 – 32 In Fig . 1D an archetypical ionic current – voltage ( I – V ) curve is given for a CEM channel with the three distinct regions in the I – V regions clearly displayed . The first linear region ( i ) follows Ohm ' s law for given electrolyte and membrane resis - tivity values . The second region ( ii ) is characterized by a pla - teau resulting from the reduced counterion concentration at the fiber inlet . In the third region ( iii ) , the linear increase in the I – V characteristics , above the limiting current , is referred to as the over - limiting current . 26 , 33 – 35 This over - limiting cur - rent occurs due to electrically - induced convection , electro - convection , electroosmotic convection and / or water splitting at the inlet of the membrane . 36 , 37 According to this theory , inhomogeneities of the membrane cause an irregular electric field that interacts with the extended space charge , which is built up due to an excess of counterions adjacent to the membrane which is established above the limiting current density . 38 The limiting current density is here determined as the intersection of the curve tangents of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) ( Fig . 1D ) . In this work , we address the limiting current issues by presenting a systematic investigation of the I – V curves for CEMs under different experimental conditions ( different charged molecules at different concentrations ) . The poly - anion 2 - acrylamido - 2 - methylpropane sulfonic acid ( AMPSA ) cross - linked with the polyalcohol polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) was chosen as the model CEM material system ( Fig . 1A ) . The experimental values of the limiting current , thus obtained , have been compared with those acquired from finite - element modeling . To obtain effective ion transport , we realized OEIPs with increased area at the CEM inlet by introducing an ion selective cap to prevent the limiting current and associ - ated water splitting . Methods OEIP fiber capillaries fabrication Glass fiber capillaries ( 25 μ m and 50 μ m inner diameter and 125 μ m outer diameter , Polymicro Technologies , CM Scien - tific ) , coated with polyimide to provide abrasion resistance and to maintain mechanical strength were used for OEIP fab - rication . The capillary was immersed into a beaker that contained sulfuric acid ( concentrated ) and was soaked for a controlled removal of the polyimide coating . When heated to 100 ° C , the sulfuric acid removes the polyimide under a slow stirring for 20 min . The glass capillaries were then rinsed with DI water . The capillary was glued to a needle adapter using a glue and heat gun and connected vertically , via 5 ml disposable polypropylene syringe , to a nitrogen line fitting for flushing . The syringe reservoir was filled with different solvents ( 1 ml ) and the valve , connected to the nitrogen sup - ply line , was opened to give the desired flow rate . The proce - dure was performed as follows : the capillary was flushed with nitrogen at 5 bar for 5 min . Then it was flushed with 2 M KOH ( aq ) and the left for 2 hours to allow for etching of the surface . This etching step increases the hydrophilicity of the capillary as KOH solution increases the surface silanol con - centration as hydroxide ions react with the silanol groups of the silica surface to produce silicate ions . 39 Next , the capillary was flushed with DI water for 10 min and dried by nitrogen flushing for 5 min . After etching the capillary , the silanization step was introduced . The capillary was flushed with 3 - ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( 10 wt % in tolu - ene ) for 1 hour followed by drying with nitrogen flushing for 5 min and ethanol flushing for 10 min . The silanization step introduces vinylic groups on the surface of the fused silica capillary and ensures that the polymer is attached covalently to the capillary wall . The silanizing agent reacts with the silanol group on the glass surface and methacrylic groups are expressed on the surface providing hydrophobic characteris - tics . 39 Finally , the capillary was flushed with the acrylate monomer 2 - acrylamido - 2 - methylpropane sulfonic acid ( AMPSA , Sigma - Aldrich , M W 2000 , 50 wt % ) using a dark sy - ringe tube for 20 min . AMPSA was mixed with polyethylene glycol diacrylate ( PEG - DA , M W 575 , 2 wt % ) and a photo - initiator ( 0 . 5 wt % 2 - hydroxy - 4 ′ - ( 2 - hydroxyethoxy ) - 2 - methyl - propiophenone , Sigma Aldrich ) that promotes cross - linking in DI water . Next , the capillary was exposed to UV light ( UVS - 28 EL Series 8 Watt UV lamp , 254 nm ) . The polymerization Lab on a Chip Paper O p e n A cce ss A r ti c l e .

After the polymerization , the capillary was cut into desired device lengths ( 15 mm ) by a fi - ber cleaver and these were then mounted directly onto heat shrink tubes / reservoirs . To hydrate the polyanion channel , OEIP capillary devices were soaked and stored in DI water be - fore use . To introduce the ion selective cap , the outer surface of the end of the capillaries was functionalized . The capil - laries were soaked in 2 M KOH ( aq ) solution for 2 hours and then in silane for 1 hour followed by ethanol soaking for 30 min . The last step was to introduce the ion selective cap at the fiber inlet , which is defined by the polyanion AMPSA ma - terial mixed with ( 3 - glycidyloxypropyl ) trimethoxysilane ( GOPs ) , a photoinitiator ( 2 - hydroxy - 4 ′ - ( 2 - hydroxyethoxy ) - 2 - methylpropiophenone , Sigma Aldrich ) for cross - linking in DI water and an aliphatic adhesion promoter . The capillary was exposed to UV light for 10 min . The capillaries were flushed with nitrogen during the polymerization step . Electrical characterization To investigate the limiting current for the fiber capillaries , electrical characterization was performed using a Keithley 2602 SourceMeter with custom designed LabVIEW software . These were used to source voltage in the range 0 – 5 V simulta - neously recording the current at a scan rate of 5 mV s − 1 . The limiting current was studied and evaluated for HCl , KCl and acetylcholine chloride ( AChCl ) at different concentrations ( 100 mM , 10 mM , 1 mM , 0 . 1 mM ) with and without the ion selectivity cap at the inlet of the fiber . Immediately before the main experiments , the channels were loaded with the desired ions . The devices were operated in a target solution of 100 mM KCl ( aq ) at a constant voltage of 1 V . The source reservoir was loaded with 100 mM HCl ( aq ) , KCl ( aq ) , AChCl ( aq ) respectively . Computational simulations The device was modelled by the Nernst – Planck – Poisson equa - tions ( 2 ) – ( 4 ) , which were solved with the COMSOL Multiphysics 5 . 3a software , according to the procedure in ref . 40 . j i = − D i ( ∇ c i + z i fc i ∇ V ) ( 2 ) ∇ j i = − d c i / d t ( 3 )       2 V F z c c i i i fix ( 4 ) The model assumes a homogeneous membrane with a fixed charge concentration c fix . A 2D axisymmetric geometry was used for the model , effectively making it a 2D computa - tional problem ( Fig . S2 † ) . Special care was taken in meshing the CEM - electrolyte interface , with mesh sizes in the order of 0 . 1 nm perpendicular to the interface , as quantities changes very rapidly at this surface . The inner and outer diameter of the capillary were set to 25 μ m and 130 μ m , respectively . The fixed charge concentration was set to 1 . 8 M ( estimated experi - mentally ) . The diffusion coefficients in water were set according to literature to D K + = 19 . 6 × 10 − 10 , D Cl − = 20 . 3 × 10 − 10 and D ACh + = 5 . 5 × 10 − 10 m 2 s − 1 . 41 The diffusion coeffi - cients are lower within the membrane and were decreased by a factor of 0 . 154 to match the experimental data . The diame - ter of the selective cap was set to 100 μ m . No contribution from convection or water splitting was included in the model . The concentration boundary conditions for the source reser - voir were set according to the corresponding experimental conditions and the potential was set to the applied potential V P . The target reservoir was electrically grounded and com - prised 100 mM KCl in all experiments . The OEIP outlet was implemented according to the membrane - electrolyte Donnan equilibrium ( c + = 1809 . 9 mM , c − = 9 . 9 mM , V = − 0 . 19 V ) to cre - ate a constant interface which does not affect the source side of the device . The limiting current was defined as the current for which the concentration next to the membrane was 1 / 1000 of the bulk electrolyte concentration and it was deter - mined by ramping the driving voltage from 0 V to 4 V and picking the current value for which the concentration criteria was fulfilled . Results and discussion Fiber capillary OEIPs with 15 mm long / 25 μ m and 50 μ m in - ner diameter and 7 mm long / 25 μ m inner diameter CEM channels were fabricated ( Fig . 1A and B ) to investigate the ef - fect of geometrical characteristics of the capillary pump at the limiting current and the water splitting regime . To inves - tigate the limiting current for the fiber CEMs , the source res - ervoir was loaded with a 100 mM HCl ( aq ) solution . The volt - age was then sourced within the range of 0 – 5 V and the currents were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s − 1 for different HCl concentrations ( 10 mM , 1 mM , 0 . 1 mM ) . The limiting current and threshold voltage for capillaries with 50 μ m in - ner diameter matched the measured data for capillaries with 25 μ m inner diameter reasonably well ( Fig . S3B † ) . The geo - metrical characteristics of the capillary pump affect its resis - tance , thus affecting the limiting current and the water split - ting regime . As the channel is an ionic resistor , a shorter channel results in a lower resistance , meaning that the limit - ing current is reached at a lower voltage . The length of the channel doesn ' t affect the limiting current density but does affect the threshold voltage ( Fig . S3C † ) . The experiment was repeated for the 25 μ m inner diameter capillary by switching the source electrolyte to KCl and AChCl to investigate ions of different sizes and of different biological relevance . The limit - ing current of the CEM membrane was measured in the same manner as for HCl , at different electrolyte concentrations . The obtained I – V curves clearly show the three characteristic regions , and they are most pronounced for the relatively lower electrolyte concentrations ( 1 and 0 . 1 mM ) . From the re - sults given in Fig . 2A – C , the limiting current depends on the concentration , but also on the diffusion coefficient of the ions as I lim , H + > I lim , K + > I lim , ACh + as expected .

During water splitting , H + and OH − ions are produced at the inlet , with the H + being transported through the OEIP into the target with potentially undesirable effects . 42 , 43 To determine if water splitting occurred , the fiber inlet and outlet were monitored using a horizontal spectral microscope system during KCl ( 1 mM ) delivery in real time ( Fig . 2D and E ) . A phenol red pH indicator was added to the KCl source electrolyte and a methyl red pH indicator was added to KCl target electrolyte . The OEIP was operated con - tinuously in the range 0 – 3 . 5 V and microscope images were taken every 1 . 5 min . The red channel images given in Fig . 2D was generated by first subtracting an image prior to the ex - periment from the time series , then amplifying the remaining red channel of the image by a factor of 5 . The so - lution , including the phenol red indicator , exhibits a gradual transition from yellow to red over the pH range from 6 . 8 to 8 . 2 . Above pH 8 . 2 , phenol red turns into a bright red color . The cations ( H + ) flow leftward into the fiber inlet and the an - ions ( OH − ) flow out from the inlet , causing a color change to occur . At the outlet side a KCl ( 1 mM ) solution , including the methyl red indicator , exhibited a gradual transition from yel - low to red below the pH range from 6 . 2 to 4 . 4 . Below pH 6 . 2 , methyl exhibits a bright red color . The cations ( H + ) flow left - ward ( Fig . 2E ) into the fiber inlet toward the outlet , causing a color change to occur at the fiber outlet . The limiting current was reached at 0 . 5 V and OH − and H + started to appear at the fiber inlet and outlet , respectively , at higher voltages , confirming the presence of water splitting . For the voltages and currents beyond this point , the major contribution to an increase of ion current through the CEM is then related to H + transport . A corresponding change of the pH was recorded at the fiber inlet and outlet , and was due to accumulation and transport of remaining OH − and H + , respectively . To better understand the ion transport processes at the in - let , the fiber OEIP inlet was modelled with the Nernst – Planck – Poisson equations , 40 which previously have been ap - plied to similar iontronic devices . 44 The inlet was modelled for various ionic species , concentrations , and applied volt - ages in order to determine the limiting currents , which here is defined as the current for which the concentration at the inlet has decreased by a factor 1000 with respect to the electrolyte bulk concentration . The calculated limiting cur - rents are shown as dashed lines in Fig . 2A – C , and the calcu - lated values matches the measured data reasonably well . Fig . 3A shows the concentration and voltage profiles at the inlet ( x = 0 μ m ) for c = 10 mM KCl and V = 0 – 4 V . Because of the spherical geometry at the inlet , the concentration gradi - ent has a nonlinear profile , in contrast to the semi - linear concentration gradient often calculated for flat CEM mem - branes . Before the limiting current is reached , the concentra - tion profile becomes steeper with increasing voltage . Once the limiting current is reached , most sections of the concen - tration profile become more or less independent of the ap - plied voltage and the concentration profiles scales then line - arly with the bulk electrolyte concentration . At this point any increase in applied voltage results in a greater loss in the electric potential at the electrolyte – CEM interface as shown in Fig . 3B . The resulting high electric field at the interface is the cause of local convection effects and water splitting in real devices . Based on the analysis above we conclude that the cause of the irregularities in current – voltage characteristics is gener - ated by concentration polarization at the inlet . Also , we found that this generates water splitting at the inlet , which leads to transport and delivery of H + , an undesirable consequence for most devices and applications . The measurements and simu - lations also show that this issue is especially severe for larger molecules ( lower diffusion coefficient ) at lower concentra - tions in the source electrolyte , a common scenario when de - livering biologically relevant molecules . To resolve this issue , we therefore re - engineered the inlet geometry to allow for higher currents without reaching the limiting current . We Fig . 3 Concentration and voltage at the inlet for 10 mM KCl . A ) The K + concentration profiles at the inlet for V = 0 – 4 V . The curves for 3 V and 4 V are nearly identical . B ) Voltage profiles for V = 0 – 4 V . For lower voltages the voltage drop at the CEM is quite small , while at limiting current conditions ( V = 3 V and 4 V ) additionally applied voltage is dropped at the interface ( x : distance from fiber inlet ) .

View Article Online Lab Chip , 2019 , 19 , 1427 – 1435 | 1433 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019 achieved this by designing an ion selective cap at the fiber in - let ( Fig . 4A ) to increase the area of the electrolyte – CEM inter - face . The OEIP fiber inlet was functionalized and immersed for 20 min into the AMPSA solution . The fiber inlet with the ion selective drop was exposed to UV radiation for 10 min . Fig . 4B and C shows the I – V curves obtained , with the addi - tion of the ion selective cap for the CEM at different HCl and AChCl concentrations . Indeed , the measured I – V curves for OEIPs with the cap do not show the typical signs of limiting currents which are characteristic for devices without a cap ( Fig . 2A – C ) . Simulations of devices with a cap of 100 μ m di - ameter confirm the effect ( Fig . 4D and E ) as this cap in - creases the limiting current by an order of magnitude . The influence of the cap on the limiting current can be under - stood by considering the ion concentration that decreases from that of the bulk electrolyte to nearly zero at the electro - lyte – CEM interface . The selectivity of the CEM causes the ion transport to be diffusion - dependent , thus the current density Fig . 4 A ) Microscope images of fiber with and without the ion selective cap at the inlet .

For small inlets / caps , the geometry is close to spherical and the limiting current thus scales faster than linearly with respect to inlet area . For larger caps , the diffu - sion gradient starts to resemble that of a planar membrane due to the decreasing curvature of the surface , and the limit - ing current will thus scale linearly with the surface area of the inlet cap . The selective cap resolves several of the issues related to miniaturization of OEIPs . As the OEIPs must be operated below the limiting current to avoid water splitting , it is cru - cial that the limiting current is high enough for the envi - sioned applications . The cap effectively resolves this by gath - ering ions from a larger surface of the electrolyte , thereby avoiding depletion - limitation of ion transport along the inter - face . This will then allow the OEIP to operate properly with a source electrolyte of low concentration including ionic spe - cies with low diffusion coefficient ; a common combination for biologically active substances and applications . Also , the areal cap allows for the use of arbitrarily small channels as it entirely decouples the inlet from the channel dimensions . Conclusions We have investigated irregularities observed in the I – V curves for miniaturized capillary OEIPs . The I – V curves obtained for HCl , KCl , and AChCl source electrolytes all show three char - acteristic regions , which are associated with concentration polarization occurring at the inlet . Concentration polariza - tion can lead to OEIP operation in the over - limiting current regime , which can cause water splitting . Indeed , when inves - tigated , water splitting was found to occur at the inlet of the capillary OEIP and is typically undesired as this process can generate pH changes and loss in transport efficiency . A com - bined experimental and simulation study established a good correlation between the limiting ion current and the electro - lyte concentration and diffusion coefficient of the ion . Our findings show that it would be problematic to transport many biologically relevant ions , as they typically come at low con - centrations and often exhibit low diffusion coefficients . We solved this limitation and restriction by developing an ion selective cap manufactured at the inlet , which significantly increases the surface area of the inlet and thereby the limit - ing current of the OEIP . This will enable miniaturized OEIPs to transport biologically relevant ions at relatively much higher rates and thereby address a wider range of bio - medically relevant applications and needs , such as in applica - tions related to neurological disorders and diseases where a wide window of drug delivery frequencies and amplitudes is desired .
