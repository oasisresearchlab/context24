We identiﬁed mutations that suppressed both the lethality and the excessive actin cable formation caused by overexpression of a truncated Bni1p ( BNI1 D N ) . Two recessive mutations , act1 - 301 in the actin gene and sla2 - 82 in a gene involved in cortical actin patch assembly , were identiﬁed . The isolation of sla2 - 82 was unexpected , because cortical actin patches are required for the internalization step of endocytosis . Both act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 exhibited synthetic growth defects with bni1 D . act1 - 301 , which resulted in an E117K substitution , interacted genetically with mutations in proﬁlin ( PFY1 ) and BUD6 , suggesting that Act1 - 301p was not fully functional in formin - mediated polymerization . sla2 - 82 also in - teracted genetically with genes involved in actin cable assembly . Some experiments , however , suggested that the effects of sla2 - 82 were caused by depletion of actin monomers , because the temperature - sensitive growth phenotype of the bni1 D sla2 - 82 mutant was suppressed by increased expression of ACT1 . The isolation of suppressors of the BNI1 D N phenotype may provide a useful system for identiﬁcation of actin amino - acid residues that are important for formin - mediated actin polymerization and mutations that affect the availability of actin monomers . T HE actin cytoskeleton plays essential roles in a di - verse set of cellular processes , including cell po - larization , cytokinesis , cell adhesions , and endocytosis . The dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton is spatially and temporally regulated . How the actin cyto - skeleton assembles and functions , including how its assembly relates to its function , are fundamental ques - tions in cell biology . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excel - lent model system for studies of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics because yeast cells have a relatively simple actin cytoskeleton and offer powerful experimental tools . Throughout the yeast cell cycle , precisely choreographed changes in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton underlie spatial control of cell - surface growth and thereby determine cell morphology . Extension of the cell sur - face is preceded by the polarized organization of two actin - ﬁlament - containing structures : actin cables and cortical actin patches . Actin cables , long bundles of actin ﬁlaments , are highly dynamic structures containing actin ( Act1p ) , ﬁmbrin ( Sac6p ) , and tropomyosin ( Tpm1p and Tpm2p ) . They originate from polarized sites such as a bud tip and extend throughout the mother cell along the cell axis . One major function of actin cables is to serve as tracks for the polarized transport of secretory vesicles by Myo2p , a type V myosin ( G ovindan et al . 1995 ; P ruyne et al . 1998 ) . Bni1p and Bnr1p , members of the formin pro - tein family , play an essential role in actin cable assembly ( E vangelista et al . 2002 ; S agot et al . 2002a ) by stim - ulating actin nucleation ( P ruyne et al . 2002 ; S agot et al . 2002b ) . Formins are a family of highly conserved eu - karyotic proteins implicated in a wide range of actin - based processes . These proteins are characterized by the presence of the juxtaposed formin homology ( FH ) do - mains , FH1 and FH2 ( E vangelista et al . 2003 ) . The proline - rich FH1 domain binds to the actin - monomer - binding protein proﬁlin ( Pfy1p ) , whereas the FH2 do - main is sufﬁcient for actin ﬁlament nucleation in vitro . Moreover , proﬁlin – actin enhances nucleation by the FH1 – FH2 domain but not the FH2 domain alone , sug - gesting that the interaction between the FH1 domain and proﬁlin is required for increased nucleation ( P ring et al . 2003 ) . A 12S complex termed the polarisome comprises Bni1p , Spa2p , Pea2p , and Bud6p ( S heu et al . 1998 ) , all of which are required for apical growth . In their absence , cells fail to conﬁne a growth site to a small 1 Corresponding author : Division of Molecular Interaction , Institute for Genetic Medicine , Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine , N - 15 W - 7 , Kita - ku , Sapporo , Hokkaido 060 - 0815 , Japan .

Bud6p , like proﬁlin , interacts with actin monomers and can enhance actin nucleation by Bni1p ( M oseley et al . 2004 ) . Cortical actin patches and their associated proteins are involved in the internalization step of endocyto - sis ( E ngqvist - G oldstein and D rubin 2003 ) . Cortical patches are associated with invaginations of the plasma membrane ( M ulholland et al . 1994 ) , have life times of only 5 – 20 sec ( S mith et al . 2001 ) , and are highly motile ( D oyle and B otstein 1996 ; W addle et al . 1996 ; C arlsson et al . 2002 ) . The formation and reorganiza - tion of cortical actin patches are regulated by cortical - patch - like protein structures , including the Arp2 / 3 complex and several of its activators , and endocytic adaptors and scaffolds ( P ruyne and B retscher 2000 ) . Sla2p , one of the patch components , contains an AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain that interacts with inositol phospholipids ( S un et al . 2005 ) . In addi - tion , Sla2p contains a central coiled - coil region and a talin homology domain at its C terminus ( Y ang et al . 1999 ) . The talin homology domain binds to ﬁlamentous actin and is localized to actin structures when it alone is expressed in vivo ( Y ang et al . 1999 ) . Real - time analyses of live sla2 D mutant cells expressing enhanced green ﬂuo - rescent protein - tagged patch assembly proteins revealed the formation of actin comet tail - like structures and in - hibition of endocytic internalization , demonstrating that Sla2p negatively regulates assembly of actin ﬁlaments associated with endocytic vesicles ( K aksonen et al . 2003 ) . In this study , we found two new mutant alleles , act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 , which suppressed growth defects caused by overexpression of an N - terminally truncated ( dominant active ) Bni1p . Both mutations suppressed the accumula - tion of the actin - cable - like structures induced by the trun - cated Bni1p . Our system provides a useful method to identify genes that affect the assembly or dynamics of actin cables . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , media , and genetic techniques : Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 with their genotypes . Strains were grown in rich YPDA medium [ 1 % yeast extract ( Difco Laboratories , Detroit ) , 2 % bacto - peptone ( Difco ) , 2 % glucose , and 0 . 01 % adenine ] or YPGA medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % bacto - peptone , 3 % galactose , 0 . 2 % sucrose , and 0 . 01 % ade - nine ) . The lithium acetate method was used for introduction of plasmids into yeast cells ( E lble 1992 ; G ietz and W oods 2002 ) . Yeast strains carrying complete gene deletions ( bni1 D , bud6 D , end3 D , mti1 D , and vrp1 D ) ; GAL1 promoter - inducible 3HA - BNI1 D 1 - 1226 , 3HA - BNR1 D 1 - 755 , and 3HA - BNI1 ; and green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged MYO2 were constructed by PCR - based procedures as described ( L ongtine et al . 1998 ) . The pfy1 - 116 and las17 - 11 mutants were constructed by three successive backcrosses into the YEF473 background strain . To construct YEF1159 ( sla2 - D 1 P GAL1 - BNI1 D N ) , the P GAL1 - BNI1 ( 1227 - 1953 ) fragment was integrated at the LEU2 locus of YEF186 ( sla2 - D 1 ) . Strains carrying plasmids were selected in synthetic medium ( SD ) containing the required nutritional supplements . When indicated , synthetic galactose medium containing 0 . 5 % casamino acids and 20 m g / ml tryptophan ( SGA – Ura ) was used . Standard genetic manipulations of yeast cells were performed as described previously ( S herman 2002 ) . Molecular biological techniques : PCRampliﬁcationwasper - formed using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 ( Applied Bio - systems , Foster City , CA ) . The DNA sequences of all constructs containing ampliﬁed PCR products were conﬁrmed using an ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing ready re - action kit ( Applied Biosystems ) according to the manufac - turer’s protocol . DNA sequences were obtained using an ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencer ( Applied Biosystems ) . The plas - mids used in this study are listed in Table 2 . Schemes for the construction of plasmids and the sequences of PCR primers are available upon request . Two - hybrid analysis was performed using strain L40 containing the LexA – DNA - binding domain fusion plasmid and the Gal4 - transcriptional activation domain fusion plasmid . The extent of the two - hybrid interaction was assayed by growth on SD – Trp – Leu – His plates . Isolation of mutations that suppress the lethality caused by the overexpression of Bni1p ( 1227 - 1953 ) : To isolate sponta - neous mutants that overcome the growth inhibition caused by overexpression of the dominant active formin , YKT380 cells—in which BNI1 D 1 - 1226 , the sole copy of BNI1 in these cells , was expressed under the control of a galactose - inducible GAL1 promoter ( HIS3 T P GAL1 - 3HA - BNI1 D 1 - 1226 ) —were plated on 30 YPGA plates ( 1 3 10 7 cells / plate ) and grown at 25 (cid:2) for 3 days . Eighty - seven revertants were picked up . To eliminate mutants in which the GAL1 promoter was not induced , we transformed these mutants with pSMA111 ( pRS316 - P GAL10 - GIN11 ) or pRS316 - P GAL7 - LacZ , which contained the GIN11 gene that inhibits growth when overexpressed ( K awahata et al . 1999 ) and the LacZ gene under the control of galactose - inducible promoters , respectively . b - Galactosidase activity was measured by a 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl - b - d - galactopyranoside ﬁlter assay ( V ojtek et al . 1993 ) . Mutations in nine mutants were judged to speciﬁcally suppress the growth inhibition caused by Bni1p ( 1227 - 1953 ) overexpression . Tetrad analysis revealed that three of these nine clones carried a single re - cessive mutation that was responsible for the suppression . We found that the growth of two of these mutants was inhibited at 37 (cid:2) on glucose - containing medium . This temperature - sensitive growth phenotype cosegregated with the suppression of growth inhibition by Bni1p ( 1227 - 1953 ) overexpression and was sup - pressed by a single copy of BNI1 . Another clone also showed a temperature - sensitive growth phenotype on glucose - containing medium , butthisphenotypewasnotsuppressedbyasinglecopy of BNI1 . To clone the mutated genes , we transformed the mu - tants with a YCp50 – LEU2 - based genomic library and isolated transformants that grew on glucose - containing plates at 37 (cid:2) but not on galactose - containing plate at 25 (cid:2) . Library plasmids were isolated , subcloning was performed by standard methods , and , using the linkage analysis , one allele each of act1 , pat1 , and sla2 was isolated . During the course of cloning , we found that a plasmid harboring ACT1 ( YCp50 – LEU2 - 2 . 4 . 1 ) suppressed the growth defect of the bni1 D sla2 - 82 mutant ( see results ) . Cloning of act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 : To construct pRS316 - ACT1 , a Bam HI – Eco RI ACT1 genomic fragment isolated from YCp – LEU2 - 2 . 4 . 1 was subcloned into the Bam HI – Eco RI gap of pRS316 . pRS316 - act1 - 301 was constructed by the gap - repair method using pRS316 - ACT1 linearized with Mun I . To con - struct pRS313 - SLA2gap , a 574 - bp Eco RI – Aat II fragment and a 502 - bp Aat II – Sal I fragment containing 5 9 - and 3 9 - ﬂanking 528 S . Yoshiuchi et al .

SLA2 and sla2 - 82 were cloned by the gap - repair method using pRS313 - SLA2gap linearized with Aat II . Microscopic observations : Cells expressing Myo2p – GFP were ﬁxed for 10 min by the direct addition of 37 % form - aldehyde stock solution ( Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Osaka , Japan ) to a 3 . 7 % ﬁnal concentration in medium and observed using a GFP bandpass ﬁlter set ( excitation , 460 – 500 nm ; dichroic mirror , 505 nm ; emission , 510 – 560 nm ) . To visualize the actin cytoskeleton , cells were ﬁxed as described above , harvested , and ﬁxed again for 1 hr in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 3 . 7 % formaldehyde . Fixed cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 1 m m tetramethylrhodamineisothiocyanate ( TRITC ) - phalloidin ( Sigma Chemical , St . Louis ) . Following three washes with PBS , cells were mounted in 50 % glycerol containing n - propyl gallate ( Wako ) . Cells were observed using a G - 2A TRITC ﬁlter set ( excitation , 510 – 560 nm ; dichroic mirror , 575 nm ; emission , 590 nm ) . Microscopic observation was performed as described previously ( M ochida et al . 2002 ) . To quantify the polarized localization of Myo2p – GFP , at least 200 small - budded cells were randomly selected and observed . Small buds were iden - tiﬁed to be , 30 % the size of the mother cell . RESULTS Identiﬁcation of act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 mutations that suppress the growth inhibition caused by overexpres - sion of a dominant active Bni1p : Overexpression of NH 2 - terminally truncated forms of Bni1p or Bnr1p leads to disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , in - cluding the production of an excessive number of actin cables and the depolarization of actin patches , resulting in inhibition of cell growth ( E vangelista et al . 1997 ; K ikyo et al . 1999 ) . To search for regulators of actin cy - toskeletal reorganization , we screened for mutations that suppressed the growth inhibition caused by overex - pression of NH 2 - terminally truncated Bni1p . P GAL1 - 3HA - BNI1 D 1 - 1226 ( P GAL1 - BNI1 D N ) mutant cells overexpress a truncated Bni1p , Bni1p ( 1227 - 1953 ) , which contains the FH1 and FH2 domains . This mutant does not grow in galactose medium , in which the GAL1 promoter is induced . We screened for spontaneous revertants that could grow in galactose medium . We isolated three in - dependent revertants that each carried a single recessive TABLE 2 Plasmids used in this study Plasmid Characteristic Source pSMA111 P GAL10 - GIN11 URA3 CEN6 K awahata et al .

The second gene , PAT1 , is involved in mRNA de - capping ( B onnerot et al . 2000 ) . The third gene , SLA2 , codes for Sla2p , a protein involved in the assembly of cortical actin patches ( H oltzman et al . 1993 ; R aths et al . 1993 ) . We next investigated how the act1 and sla2 mutant alleles ( designated act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 , respec - tively ) suppressed the phenotypes caused by overexpres - sion of a truncated Bni1p . Both act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 also suppressed the growth defect of BNR1 D N - overexpressing cells as well as that of the BNI1 D N - overexpressing cells ( Figure 1A ) . P GAL1 - BNI1 D N cells carrying act1 - 301 or sla2 - 82 showed normal spherical morphology and po - larized distributions of cortical actin patches and actin cables ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that these mutations sup - pressed the excessive formation of actin cables . In - terestingly , both act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 showed synthetic growth defects with bni1 D at higher temperatures ( Figures 1C , 3A , and 5B ) . Act1 - 301p seems to impair Bni1p - catalyzed actin polymerization : We cloned the act1 - 301 mutant gene and determined its DNA sequence . act1 - 301 contained a point mutation resulting in the substitution of a Lys residue for a Glu residue at amino - acid position 117 . For act1 - 301 mutant cells , the growth rates at low and high temperatures , cell morphology , polarized distributions of actin patches and cables , and ﬂuid - phase endocytosis as assayed by the uptake of Lucifer yellow were in - distinguishable from wild - type cells ( data not shown ) , indicating that the E117K substitution did not severely impair the functions of Act1 - 301p . The FH2 domain of Bni1p is required for actin cable assembly in vivo ( E vangelista et al . 2002 ; S agot et al . 2002a ) and stimulates actin polymerization in vitro ( P ruyne et al . 2002 ; S agot et al . 2002b ) . In the absence of BNR1 , a structural and functional homolog of BNI1 with a minor role , three temperature - sensitive alleles of BNI1 that produce proteins with amino - acid substitu - tions in the FH2 domain— bni1 - 116 ( V1475A , K1498E , and D1511N ) ( K adota et al . 2004 ) , bni1 - 11 ( D1511G and K1601R ) ( E vangelista et al . 2002 ; P ruyne et al . 2002 ) , and bni1 - FH2 # 1 ( R1528A and R1530A ) —cause actin cables to rapidly disappear when the mutant cells are incubated at high temperatures . The Bni1FH2 # 1 protein also exhibits defective actin polymerization in vitro ( S agot et al . 2002b ) . We found that the pheno - type caused by bni1 - 11 was the result of a single amino - acid substitution , D1511G ( data not shown ) . Similar to bni1 D , the bni1 alleles bni1 - 116 , bni1 ( D1511G ) , and bni1 - FH2 # 1 , when combined with act1 - 301 , caused the temperature - sensitive growth phenotypes ( Figure 2A ) . These results suggest that the actin - polymerizing activity of Bni1p is relevant to the genetic interaction of bni1 mutations with act1 - 301 . The temperature - sensitive growth of bni1 D act1 - 301 mutant cells seems to be due to defective actin cable formation . Labeling of actin cables with phalloidin , however , did not allow us to examine this possibility , because almost no actin cables could be detected in the bni1 D cells ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we visualized a GFP - tagged type V myosin , Myo2p – GFP , whose polar - ized localization depends on actin cables ( K arpova et al . F igure 1 . —Identiﬁcation of act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 . ( A ) act1 - 301 and sla2 - 82 mutations suppress growth defects caused by overexpression of a dominant active BNI1 or BNR1 .

Suppressors of a Dominant Active Formin 531 2000 ) in bni1 - 116 act1 - 301 mutant cells . Because a fraction of Myo2p – GFP is localized at bud tips in an actin - independent manner ( A yscough et al . 1997 ) , we examined the time course of polarized Myo2p – GFP lo - calization after a temperature upshift . act1 - 301 alone did not affect Myo2p – GFP localization after a 5 - min incubation at 37 (cid:2) , but , after 10 and 30 min , slightly enhanced the mislocalization of Myo2p that was seen in wild - type cells . In the bni1 - 116 single mutant , Myo2p – GFP was slightly mislocalized after a 5 - min incubation at 37 (cid:2) and completely mislocalized after 30 min . Myo2p – GFP was completely mislocalized even after a 5 - min in - cubation at 37 (cid:2) in the bni1 - 116 act1 - 301 mutant ( Figure 2 , B and C ) . These results suggest that act1 - 301 exacer - bates the actin - cable - assembly defects in the bni1 - 116 mutant . act1 - 301 genetically interacts with a mutation in proﬁlin and BUD6 : The genetic interactions between act1 - 301 and other genes related to Bni1p function were further investigated . act1 - 301 showed synthetic growth defects with the mutant proﬁlin allele pfy1 - 116 and bud6 D , but not with spa2 D ( Figure 3A ) . Interestingly , the synthetic growth defect with bud6 D was more severe : the bud6 D bni1 - 116 act1 - 301 mutant did not grow even at 30 (cid:2) . Pfy1p and Bud6p interact with the FH1 and the COOH - terminal domains of Bni1p , respectively ( E vangelista et al . 1997 ) . These proteins speciﬁcally bind actin mono - mers to stimulate nucleotide exchange ( M oseley et al . 2004 ) . We examined whether the interactions of Bni1p with these proteins are required for act1 - 301 mutant cells to grow . Truncation mutants of Bni1p , which lacked the domains that interact with Rho / Cdc42p ( D RBD ) , Spa2p ( D SBD ) , Pfy1p ( D FH1 ) , or Bud6p ( D BBD ) , or lacked the FH2 domain ( D FH2 ) , were expressed in bni1 D act1 - 301 mutant cells and cell growth at 37 (cid:2) was examined ( Figure 3B ) . Proper expression of the mutant proteins was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting for myc - tagged versions of the truncated Bni1ps ( data not shown ) . D SBD fully restored growth , whereas D RBD only weakly restored it . D FH1 , D FH2 , and D BBD , how - ever , failed to restore any growth . Our results suggest that act1 - 301 affected the assembly of actin cables , a process in which Bni1p acts to polymerize actin through interactions with Pfy1p and Bud6p . We examined the physical interaction between Act1 - 301p and Pfy1p or Bud6p by the two - hybrid method . Act1 - 301p , however , interacted with both Pfy1p and Bud6p to an extent similar to that of Act1p ( Figure 3C ) . Furthermore , when we examined the interaction between Act1 - 301p and Bni1p fragments containing the FH1 and FH2 domains , we found that Act1 - 301p and Act1p interacted with Bni1p ( 1227 - 1953 ) to a similar extent . Bni1p ( 1227 - 1750 ) , which lacked the Bud6p - binding domain , also inter - acted with both Act1 - 301p and Act1p ( Figure 3C ) , but F igure 2 . —Defects caused by act1 - 301 aretiedtoBni1p - mediated actin polymerization .

The bni1 D act1 - 301 strain ( YKT968 ) was transformed with pRS314 ( mock ) , pRS314 - BNI1 ( BNI1 ) , pRS314 - bni1 - 116 ( 116 ) , pRS314 - bni1 ( D1511G ) ( D1511G ) , or pRS314 - bni1 - FH2 # 1 ( FH2 # 1 ) .

Bni1p ( 1348 - 1953 ) , which lacked the FH1 domain , did not ( data not shown ) . Since Pfy1p binds to the FH1 domain , the two - hybrid interaction of Bni1p with actin may be mediated by the interaction between Bni1p and Pfy1p . The previously isolated act1 - 101 mutation also acts as a suppressor of the growth defects caused by the BNI1 D N overexpression : Our identiﬁcation of act1 - 301 suggests that isolation of suppressor mutations of the BNI1 D N - overexpressing mutant is useful to identify amino - acid residues that are speciﬁcally required for the actin cable assembly . Previously , a large collection of act1 mu - tant alleles , which affect residues over the surface of Act1p protein , was generated by alanine - scanning mu - tagenesis ( W ertman et al . 1992 ) . We examined ﬁve of these alleles and four other temperature - sensitive act1 mutant alleles for the suppression of growth defects of the BNI1 D N - overexpressing cells . Interestingly , act1 - 101 ( D363A , E364A ) displayed the suppression ( Figure 4 ) . Aspartate 363 and glutamate 364 of Act1p also may be involved in the formin - mediated actin poly - merization . sla2 - 82 genetically interacts with mutations in other actin - cable - related genes : Phenotypic suppression of P GAL1 - BNI1 D N by sla2 - 82 and the synthetic growth defect between bni1 D and sla2 - 82 are surprising , because Sla2p is a component of the machinery that assembles cortical actin patches . When sla2 - 82 was combined with bni1 - 116 , bni1 ( D1511G ) , or bni1 - FH2 # 1 , the resulting double mutants showed a temperature - sensitive growth pheno - type ( Figure 5A ) , indicating that the actin - polymerizing activity of Bni1p is relevant to the genetic interaction of bni1 mutations with sla2 - 82 . We further examined the genetic interactions of sla2 - 82 with mutations in actin - cable - related genes and found that sla2 - 82 exhibited synthetic growth defects with both pfy1 - 116 and bud6 D ( Figure 5B ) . Experiments using the BNI1 deletion con - structs schematized in Figure 3B also suggested that the interaction of Bni1p with Pfy1p and Bud6p was required for sla2 - 82 mutant cells to grow ( Figure 5C ) . Defective assembly of actin cables in the bni1 D sla2 - 82 mutant was further examined by the observation of Myo2p – GFP . sla2 - 82 alone slightly enhanced Myo2p – GFP mislocalization in wild - type cells after incubations of 5 – 30 min at 37 (cid:2) . In contrast , Myo2p – GFP was com - pletely mislocalized even after a 5 - min incubation at 37 (cid:2) in the bni1 - 116 sla2 - 82 mutant ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . These results suggest that sla2 - 82 exacerbates the defects F igure 3 . —The proﬁlin - and Bud6p - related func - tions of Act1 - 301p are defective .

The bni1 D act1 - 301 strain ( YKT968 ) was transformed with pRS314 ( mock ) , pRS314 - BNI1 ( Full ) , pRS314 - bni1 D 6 - 642 ( D RBD ) , pRS314 - bni1 D 826 – 986 ( D SBD ) , pRS314 - bni1 ( 1 – 1750 ) ( D BBD ) , pRS314 - bni1 D 1228 – 1414 ( D FH1 ) , or pRS314 - bni1 D 1553 – 1646 ( D FH2 ) .

Suppressors of a Dominant Active Formin 533 in cells carrying mutations in genes related to actin cable assembly . Synthetic growth defects of the bni1 D sla2 - 82 mutant may be due to depletion of the actin monomer pool : Phenotypic suppression of P GAL1 - BNI1 D N by mutations in other components involved in actin patch assembly was examined . arp2 - 1 , end3 D , and las17 - 11 , however , failed to suppress the growth defect of the P GAL1 - BNI1 D N mutant ( Figure 7A ) . Moreover , synthetic growth defects with bni1 D were not observed for sla1 D , abp1 D , arp2 - 1 , and las17 D ( Figure 7B ) , suggesting that the genetic inter - action with actin - cable - related mutations was speciﬁc to sla2 - 82 . The functional difference between Sla2p and the actin patch proteins examined above is that Sla2p nega - tively regulates the assembly of actin patches ( K aksonen et al . 2003 ) . In the sla2 D mutant , actin is continuously nucleated from nonmotile endocytic complexes , result - ing in the formation of actin comet tail - like structures . We reasoned that the sla2 - 82 mutation also caused the sequestration of actin monomers in the actin comet tails , which might render the impaired actin - cable - assembly machinery incapable of assembling a sufﬁcient number of actin cables to allow polarized growth . Consistent with this hypothesis , increasing the number of copies of ACT1 suppressed the growth defect of the bni1 D sla2 - 82 mutant and partially suppressed the Myo2p – GFP mislocalization in the bni1 - 116 sla2 - 82 mutant ( Figure 8 , A and B ) . Mti1p / Bbc1p , another negative regulator of actin patch assembly , inhibits Las17p from activating the Arp2 / 3 complex ( R odal et al . 2003 ) . mti1 D also exhibited a synthetic growth defect with bni1 D ( Figure 8C ; T ong et al . 2001 ) . We previously showed that mti1 D suppressed the temperature - sensitive growth phenotype observed in cells carrying a mutation in VRP1 , a positive regulator of actin patch assembly ( M ochida et al . 2002 ) . If genetic interactions between genes related to actin cables and actin patches occur depending on the availability of monomeric actin , bni1 D may have suppressed vrp1 D , because the size of the actin pool available for actin patch assembly would be in - creased in the bni1 D mutant . The temperature - sensitive growth phenotype of vrp1 D mutants was suppressed by bni1 D as well as by mti1 D ( Figure 8D ) . Deletion analysis of SLA2 for the suppression of growth defects of the BNI1 D N - overexpressing cells : Several structural motifs and functional domains have been identiﬁed in Sla2p ( Y ang et al . 1999 ; S un et al . 2005 ) ( Figure 9 ) .

Yoshiuchi et al . Sla2p binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( S un et al . 2005 ) , whereas the COOH - terminal talin - like domain binds to ﬁlamen - tous actin ( M c C ann and C raig 1997 ) . In the middle of Sla2p , there are a proline - rich region , a glutamine - rich region , a leucine - zipper domain , and predicted coiled - coil regions . To obtain structural information about Sla2 - 82p , sla2 - 82 was cloned and sequenced . sla2 - 82 contained a nonsense mutation at codon 491 , which resulted in the production of Sla2p D ( 491 – 968 ) . In con - trast to the sla2 D mutant , which shows a temperature - sensitive growth phenotype ( H oltzman et al . 1993 ) , the sla2 - 82 mutant grew normally at 37 (cid:2) . In addition , these cells showed a slight impairment in the polarized or - ganization of cortical actin patches and actin cables and a weakly impaired uptake of the endocytic marker Lucifer yellow ( data not shown ) , suggesting that Sla2 - 82p was partially functional . To examine the effect of the deletion of other regions of Sla2p on the growth of the Bni1p D N - overexpressing cells , we expressed SLA2 deletion mutants constructed previously ( Y ang et al . 1999 ) in cells overexpressing BNI1 D N ( Figure 9 ) . sla2 D 502 - 968 , which is deleted for nearly the same region with sla2 - 82 , displayed the suppression . However , sla2 D 768 - 968 , which is deleted for only the talin - like domain , did not display the sup - pression , suggesting that the deletion of the middle region is responsible for the suppression . Consistently , sla2 D 360 - 575 , which is deleted for the middle region , displayed the suppression . Interestingly , sla2 D 33 - 359 , sla2 D 33 - 501 , and sla2 D 33 - 750 , which are deleted for the NH 2 - terminal region , did not display the suppression , irrespective of the presence or absence of the middle region , suggesting that the NH 2 - terminal region is re - quired for the suppression . Consistently , the sla2 D mu - tant did not display the suppression ( data not shown ) . However , NH 2 - terminal deletion mutants as well as sla2 D were impaired in growth at 30 (cid:2) ( data not shown ) , raising a possibility that the lack of suppression was due to the impaired growth . In conclusion , our results at least sug - gest that deletion of the middle region of Sla2p is in - volved in the suppression of the growth inhibition caused by the BNI1 D N overexpression . DISCUSSION act1 - 301 mutant cells exhibit actin - cable - speciﬁc de - fects : act1 - 301 reduced the massive assembly of actin cables induced by overexpression of BNI1 D N . Sub - sequent genetic studies suggested that Act1 - 301p in - hibited formin - catalyzed actin assembly . Formin family proteins polymerize actin via a mechanism that is dif - ferent from that mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Sur - face amino - acid residues of actin that are important for the formin - catalyzed polymerization remain to be iden - tiﬁed . Our isolation of act1 - 301 demonstrates that these residues could be uncovered by screening cells with the mutant alleles of ACT1 for suppressors of the BNI1 D N - overexpression phenotype . Glutamate 117 , which was substituted to lysine in Act1 - 301p [ Act1p ( E117K ) ] , is one of the Act1p surface amino - acid residues that were characterized previously by systematic charged - to - alanine mutagenesis ( W ertman et al . 1992 ; D rubin et al . 1993 ) .

The strains described in A were grown in YPDA medium at 25 (cid:2) and then shifted to 37 (cid:2) for the indicated periods of time . Cells were ﬁxed and at least 200 small - budded cells were observed for each time point by ﬂuores - cence microscopy . Suppressors of a Dominant Active Formin 535 allele cause three consecutive amino - acid substitutions : R116A , E117A , and K118A . However , act1 - 119 did not suppress the growth defects of the Bni1p D N - overex - pressing cells ( Figure 4 ) , suggesting that the glutamate - to - lysine substitution at amino - acid position 117 may play an important role in the suppression . In contrast , the act1 - 101 mutation exhibited the suppression . act1 - 101 ( D363A , E364A ) mutant cells were found to have no actin cables at 37 (cid:2) ( D rubin et al . 1993 ) , which might be explained by weakened interactions with Pfy1p in the two - hybrid method ( A mberg et al . 1995 ) . Pfy1p and Bud6p bind to the FH1 and COOH - terminal domains of Bni1p , respectively , and these proteins promote actin monomers to exchange bound ADP for ATP ( M oseley et al . 2004 ) . In our two - hybrid experiments , Act1p ( E117K ) interacted normally with Pfy1p and Bud6p . act1 - 301 , however , exhibited synthetic growth defects with both pfy1 - 116 and bud6 D , raising the possibility that Act1 - p ( E117K ) is somewhat impaired in its ability to be acted on by Pfy1p or Bud6p . It is thought that formin FH2 dimers nucleate and processively cap the elongating barbed end of the actin ﬁlament , whereas proﬁlin generates a local increase of ATP – actin monomers to promote actin assembly ( M oseley et al . 2004 ; R omero et al . 2004 ; O tomo et al . 2005 ) .

E364A substitutions may interfere with a step in these processes . Genetic interactions among genes involved in the assembly of actin cables and actin patches may reﬂect the availability of actin monomers : The isolation of a mutation in SLA2 as a suppressor of the BNI1 D N - induced hyperaccumulation of actin cables was un - expected , because Sla2p is a regulator of cortical actin patch assembly . Synthetic growth defects of the bni1 D sla2 - 82 mutant also suggested that the sla2 - 82 mutation affected the dynamics of actin cables . Given that Sla2p is involved in the negative regulation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation at endocytic sites ( K aksonen et al . 2003 ) , we hypothesized that sla2 - 82 interferes with actin cable assembly by depleting the available actin mono - mers . Consistent with this idea , increased expression of Act1p suppressed the temperature - sensitive growth phenotype of the bni1 D sla2 - 82 mutant . Suppression of vrp1 D by bni1 D may be similarly explained by an increased actin pool due to low levels of actin cable assembly in bni1 D cells . In agreement with this hypoth - esis , an increased number of copies of ACT1 suppressed the phenotype caused by vrp1 - 1 ( V aduva et al . 1997 ) . Although we cannot exclude the possibility that Sla2p is more directly involved in actin cable assembly , the following two observations that implicated Sla2p in polarized growth can be similarly explained by indirect effects due to actin depletion . First , SLA2 was identiﬁed in a collection of mutants that inhibited hyperpolarized growth in cdc34 - 2 mutant cells ( B idlingmaier and S nyder 2002 ) . Second , electron microscopic studies sug - gested that Golgi - derived secretory vesicles accumulate in sla2 mutants ( M ulholland et al . 1997 ; G all et al . 2002 ) . On the basis of the observation that yeast have low levels of free actin monomers , K arpova et al . ( 1995 ) speculated that yeast actin cytoskeletons might be very static in comparison to those of motile cells wherein actin ﬁlaments can undergo very rapid cycles of assem - bly and disassembly . Quantitative analysis of the recovery rates of cortical actin patches after photo - bleaching , however , demonstrated that actin assembles in yeast at rates similar to those observed in motile cells ( K aksonen et al . 2003 ) . How two distinct actin - organizing systems for actin cables and actin patches can efﬁciently recruit and incorporate monomeric actin into actin ﬁlaments using a small pool of actin monomers remains an in - teresting research question . Finally , we cannot exclude the possibility that Bni1p and Sla2p share a third function that is independent of polarized transport and endocytosis . A mutant allele of SLA2 was identiﬁed ( mop2 ; modiﬁer of Pma1p ) as an enhancer of the phenotypes caused by a mutation in PMA1 , a gene that encodes the plasma membrane H 1 - ATPase ( N a et al . 1995 ) . In the mop2 mutant , the abun - dance of Pma1p on the plasma membrane was reduced . SLA2 might be involved in plasma membrane integrity , because sla2 mutations increased cell lysis as assayed by staining for extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity . Moreover , the cell - lysis phenotype was more prominent in the bni1 D sla2 - 82 mutant ( data not shown ) . Other reports suggested that Sla2p might also be involved in mRNA and DNA metabolism . A sla2 mutant was iden - tiﬁed in a collection of mutants that exhibited defects in the decay of several mRNAs ( Z uk et al . 1999 ) . In addi - tion , sla1 and sla2 mutants were found to enhance the sensitivity of cells to a self - poisoning mutant allele of DNA topoisomerase I mutant ( F iorani et al . 2004 ) . It remains to be clariﬁed whether these functions of Sla2p are mediated by the actin cytoskeleton .

C - terminal dele - tions were examined in YKT859 ( sla2 D 502 - 968 ) and YKT861 ( sla2 D 768 - 968 ) , which were trans - formed with pRS316 - P GAL1 - HA - BNI1 D N . N - terminal deletions were examined in YKT1159 ( sla2 D P GAL1 - HA - BNI1 D N ) , which was transformed with pRS313 - sla2 D 33 - 359 , pRS313 - sla2 D 33 - 501 , pRS313 - sla2 D 33 - 750 , or pRS313 - sla2 D 360 - 575 . The transformants were examined for growth on a galactose - containing plate ( SGA – Ura or YPGA ) at 30 (cid:2) for 3 days . The numbers indicate the posi - tions of the amino - acid residues . The represented domains or regions are the ANTH domain ( ANTH ) , the proline - rich region ( PR ) , the glutamine - rich region ( QR ) , the leucine - zipper domain ( LZ ) , predicted coiled - coil regions ( CC ) , and the talin - like domain ( talin ) ( Y ang et al . 1999 ; S un et al . 2005 ) . An arrowhead indicates the amino - acid residue 491 that was changed to a nonsense codon in sla2 - 82 . Suppressors of a Dominant Active Formin 537 advice during the course of this study .
