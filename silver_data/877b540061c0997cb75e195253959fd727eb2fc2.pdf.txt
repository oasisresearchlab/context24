Although OAD loss is the most frequent cause of human primary ciliary dyskinesia , the docking mechanism of OAD onto the ciliary doublet microtubule ( DMT ) remains elusive in vertebrates . Here , we analyzed the functions of Calaxin / Efcab1 and Armc4 , the components of vertebrate OAD - DC ( docking complex ) , using zebrafish spermatozoa and cryo - electron tomography . Mutation of armc4 caused complete loss of OAD , whereas mutation of calaxin caused only partial loss of OAD . Detailed structural analysis revealed that calaxin - / - OADs are tethered to DMT through DC components other than Calaxin , and that recombinant Calaxin can autonomously rescue the deficient DC structure and the OAD instability . Our data demonstrate the discrete roles of Calaxin and Armc4 in the OAD - DMT interaction , suggesting the stabilizing process of OAD docking onto DMT in vertebrates . .

Ciliary motility is responsible for various biological processes , including locomotion of unicellular organisms , vertebrate left - right patterning , cerebrospinal fluid flow , airway mucociliary clearance , and swimming of spermatozoa . The ciliary cytoskeleton is called an axoneme , which consists of nine peripheral doublet microtubules ( DMTs ) with central - pair microtubules ( so - called 9 + 2 structure ) or without central - pair microtubules ( so - called 9 + 0 ) . The ciliary beating force is generated by axonemal dyneins , which make two rows of projections on the DMT : outer arm dynein ( OAD ) and inner arm dynein ( IAD ) . The OAD row consists of single large dynein molecules that repeat every 24 nm . The IAD row consists of seven different types of dyneins ( IAD a to g ) that each repeat every 96 nm ( Oda et al . , 2014 ) . Although each dynein type can generate the motive force of ciliary motility , OADs mainly influence the frequency and the power output of the beating , while IADs affect the amplitude of waveform ( Brokaw , 1994 ; Brokaw & Kamiya , 1987 ; Kamiya , 2002 ) . In humans , malfunctions of motile cilia often cause primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) . PCD is a genetically heterogeneous , inherited disorder characterized by inversions of visceral laterality , hydrocephalus , recurrent respiratory infections , and male infertility . OAD Defects are the most common cause of PCD ; mutations of over 40 genes are known to cause PCD , including 24 genes related to OAD malfunctions ( Wallmeier et al . , 2020 ; Antony et al . , 2021 ) . These variations of OAD - related PCD genes reflect the multiple processes of OAD construction described below . OAD is a large protein complex composed of two heavy chains ( HCs ) , two intermediate chains , and numerous light chains . OAD subunits first undergo cytoplasmic pre - assembly before transport into cilia , which requires the support of multiple proteins called DNAAFs ( dynein axonemal assembly factors ) ( Kobayashi & Takeda , 2012 ; Mitchison et al . , 2012 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2018 ; Braschi et al . , 2022 ) . After assembly , OADs are targeted into the ciliary compartment , where the intraflagellar transport ( IFT ) machinery carries OADs along the DMT ( Kozminski et al . , 1993 ; Klena & Pigino , 2022 ) . At the final position of OAD , docking complex ( DC ) proteins interact with OADs and array them on the DMT . Although OAD structures are mostly conserved among eukaryotes , there are several differences reflecting variations in ciliary motilities . For example , OADs in green algae Chlamydomonas and ciliate Tetrahymena have three HCs ( α - , β - , and γ - HC ) , while metazoan OADs have only two HCs ( β - and γ - HC ) . DC structures also differ among organisms . Chlamydomonas DC is composed of three subunits : DC1 , DC2 , and DC3 ( Takada & Kamiya , 1994 ; Koutoulis et al . , 1997 ; Wakabayashi et al . , 2001 ; Takada et al . , 2002 ) . The DC1 / DC2 coiled - coil and the globular DC3 work as two linker structures tethering OAD to DMT ( Walton et al . , 2021 ) . On the other hand , vertebrates have pentameric DC compositions : CCDC151 , . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

CCDC151 and CCDC114 are homologous to Chlamydomonas DC1 and DC2 , respectively . Orthologues of TTC25 , ARMC4 , and Calaxin are not defined in Chlamydomonas , indicating evolutionary divergence of DC functions . As OADs generate the main force of ciliary beating , proper construction of OAD - DMT is essential for motile cilia . However , in vertebrates , the docking process of OADs and the functions of DC components remain elusive . Calaxin was first identified as a calcium sensor protein of OAD in ascidian Ciona intestinalis ( Mizuno et al . , 2009 ) . Ciona Calaxin plays important roles in sperm chemotaxis by modulating OAD activity depending on Ca 2 + concentration ( Mizuno et al . , 2012 ; Inaba , 2015 ) . To analyze the Calaxin function in vertebrates , our group previously generated knockout mutants in mice and zebrafish ( Sasaki et al . , 2019 ) . Calaxin mutants showed abnormal ciliary motilities not only in sperm flagella , but also in tracheal cilia , brain ependymal cilia , and left - right organizer cilia . These phenotypes indicate that Calaxin is essential for proper ciliary motilities , which are not necessarily related to the Ca 2 + - dependent sperm chemotaxis . Interestingly , Calaxin - / - OADs seemed mostly intact when observed by conventional transmission electron microscopy . Unlike Calaxin , other DC components ( CCDC151 , CCDC114 , TTC25 , and ARMC4 ) were already reported as human PCD - causative genes ( Hjeij et al . , 2014 ; Onoufriadis et al . , 2013 ; Knowles et al . , 2013 ; Wallmeier et al . , 2016 ; Hjeij et al . , 2013 ) . Mutations of these genes caused complete or near - complete loss of OAD in the patient’s respiratory cilia . In this study , we further analyzed the function of Calaxin using zebrafish spermatozoa and cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) . In addition to the calaxin - / - , we generated the zebrafish mutant of armc4 , the largest component of vertebrate DC , to assess the function of other DC components . armc4 mutation caused complete loss of OAD and slower sperm beating . In calaxin - / - , however , OAD was only partially lost at the distal region of sperm flagella , which was correlated with abnormal sperm waveform . Cryo - ET analysis revealed the detailed structure of zebrafish OAD - DC in WT and calaxin - / - . The remaining OADs in calaxin - / - were tethered to DMT through DC components other than Calaxin , indicating that Calaxin works to stabilize the OAD - DMT interaction . Armc4 was required for the ciliary localization of Calaxin , which implied the ciliary targeting of DC components as pre - assembled complexes . We also report the slight conformation change of vertebrate DC at higher Ca 2 + concentration , in line with the calcium sensor function of the Calaxin . .

Kupffer’s vesicle is the left - right organizer of teleost fish and orthologous to the mammalian embryonic node , in which rotating cilia produce leftward fluid flow to determine the left - right body axis ( Essner et al . , 2005 ; Hirokawa et al . , 2012 ; Shinohara & Hamada , 2017 ) . calaxin mutation caused slower rotation or irregular motion of Kupffer’s vesicle cilia , with the consequent randomization of left - right patterning . To compare the functions of different DC components , we also generated zebrafish armc4 mutants . A stop codon was inserted into exon2 of the armc4 gene by CRISPR / Cas9 ( Figure 1A - C ) . Since armc4 - / - zebrafish were viable , we established a homozygous mutant line . We observed the Kupffer’s vesicle cilia of armc4 - / - and found abnormal ciliary motilities : slower rotation , irregular motion , or immotility ( Figure 1D - F ; Video 1 ) . These ciliary motility defects induced laterality randomization , as inverted heart looping was observed in almost half of armc4 - / - embryos ( Figure 1G ) . For comparison at a glance , we displayed calaxin - / - data from our previous study ( Sasaki et al . , 2019 ) in Figure E - G . Although both calaxin - / - and armc4 - / - showed laterality defects with abnormal ciliary motilities , immotile cilia were found only in armc4 - / - Kupffer’s vesicle ( Figure 1E , red ) , indicating the more severe impact of armc4 mutation on the proper ciliary motilities . calaxin - / - and armc4 - / - spermatozoa show OAD loss and abnormal motilities We next focused on the sperm phenotypes and performed immunofluorescence microscopy . Dnah8 , the OAD γ - HC component , is localized along the entire length of WT sperm flagella ( Figure 2A ) . calaxin - / - spermatozoa showed partial loss of Dnah8 at the distal region of the flagella ( Figure 2A , white arrowheads ) . Dnah8 signal was detected in the proximal two - thirds of calaxin - / - flagella , but the border of the signal was unclear , suggesting that OADs decreased gradually toward the distal end . Unlike calaxin - / - , armc4 - / - showed complete loss of Dnah8 ( Figure 2A , asterisk ) . Calaxin signals were absent not only in calaxin - / - but also in armc4 - / - ( Figure 2B , asterisks ) . We also assessed the localization of IADs by the immunostaining of Dnah2 , the IAD - f β - HC component . Dnah2 was distributed normally along the entire length of flagella in both mutants ( Figure 2C ) . To correlate the OAD defects with ciliary motilities , we analyzed the sperm waveforms using a high - speed camera . We tracked the heads of swimming spermatozoa and generated the waveform traces and the shear angle plots ( Figure 2D ; Video 2 ) . Sperm flagella were traced at every 1 msec in WT and calaxin - / - , while 2 msec intervals were used in armc4 - / - to be adjusted for the decreased beating frequency . WT flagella exhibited a sine wave motion , . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

This distal - specific phenotype can be correlated with the loss of distal OAD in immunofluorescence microscopy . armc4 - / - flagella showed significantly slower beatings , consistent with the complete loss of OAD in immunofluorescence microscopy . Despite the OAD loss , armc4 - / - waveforms were mostly normal , suggesting that remaining IADs can sufficiently generate the sine wave motion of the sperm flagella . We also tested the sperm motilities by CASA ( computer - assisted sperm analysis ) modified for zebrafish ( Wilson - Leedy & Ingermann , 2007 ) . In both mutants , the ratios of motile spermatozoa decreased significantly ( Figure 2E ) . Swimming velocity and beating frequency were calculated from the trajectories of the motile spermatozoa ( Figure 2F - G ; Figure 2— figure supplement 1 ; Video3 ) . Compared to WT , calaxin - / - showed slightly increased swimming velocity but decreased beating frequency . In armc4 - / - , both swimming velocity and beating frequency decreased significantly compared to WT and calaxin - / - . These data were consistent with the sperm motilities observed in the waveform analysis . Cryo - electron tomography reveals the ultrastructure of WT and mutant sperm DMTs To gain structural insights into the mutant sperm phenotypes , we performed the cryo - ET analysis of sperm axonemes . Subtomographic averaging revealed the ultrastructure of the 96 - nm repeat unit of DMT ( Figure 3A ; Video 4 ) . This 96 - nm repeat unit contains four OADs , seven IADs , three radial spokes ( RSs ) , and a nexin - dynein regulatory complex ( N - DRC ) ( Figure 3B ) . Note that the local refinement was performed with four subdivided parts of the 96 - nm repeat unit : DMT with axonemal dyneins , RS1 , RS2 , and RS3 , because the RS - DMT connections were flexible . After local refinement , subdivided parts were combined to generate the whole structure of the 96 - nm repeat unit ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Our improved cryo - ET analysis revealed the detailed structural features of zebrafish DMT . We previously reported the zebrafish DMT structure with a resolution of 42 . 5 Å ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2018 ) . In this study , we increased the number of averaged particles approximately six - fold to get more reliable structures , with a resolution of ~ 22 Å ( Figure 3— figure supplement 2D ) . For each axonemal dynein , the ring structure of the motor domain was observed ( Figure 3A ; Video 4 ) . Each OAD has two motor domains , while each IAD has only one motor domain , except IAD - f , which has two motor domains with a large IC / LC ( intermediate chain and light chain ) ( Figure 3A - B ) . As for RSs , the spoke heads of RS1 and RS2 showed similar structures and resembled a pair of skis ( Figure 3A , black arrowheads ) . The RS3 spoke head showed a distorted star - like structure ( Figure 3A , white arrowhead ) . Similar features were reported in sea urchin sperm flagella ( Lin et al . , 2012 ) and human respiratory cilia ( Figure 3C ; EMD - 5950 ; Lin et al . , 2014 ) , suggesting that the structures of axonemal dyneins and RSs are mostly conserved among metazoans . .

In calaxin - / - , some tomograms appeared to lose OADs in the axoneme , while the others retained OADs . To analyze these different axonemal features separately , we performed structural classification and sorted the subtomograms into OAD + and OAD - classes . The OAD + class showed a mostly normal OAD structure ( Figure 3D ; Video 5 ) , while the OAD - class lost OAD ( Figure 3E , red dotted circles ; Video 6 ) . The armc4 - / - DMT showed complete loss of OAD ( Figure 3F , red dotted circles ; Video 7 ) . Although OAD loss was found in both mutants , no significant defect was observed in other DMT components , indicating that the functions of Calaxin and Armc4 are OAD - specific . calaxin - / - OADs are attached to DMT through DC components other than Calaxin To understand the cause of OAD loss , we further analyzed the OAD structures in WT and calaxin - / - . For the local refinement of OAD structures , four OAD repeats were extracted from the 96 - nm repeat units . This four - fold increase in the particle number contributed to the improved resolution of the OAD structure to 18 . 1 Å ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2D ) . Concerned about the slight flexibility of OAD - DMT connections , we performed the local refinement focusing on OAD HCs ( Figure 4A - B ) or DC - DMT ( Figure 4D ) . First , we compared the zebrafish OAD structure with the well - studied Chlamydomonas OAD model ( PDB - 7kzm ; Walton et al . , 2021 ) . To compare the OAD core region , we omitted the α - HC and DC linkers from the Chlamydomonas OAD model . Despite the evolutionary distance , the Chlamydomonas model fitted well into the map of zebrafish OAD , showing the conservation of OAD core structures ( Figure 4A’ - B’ ; Video 8 ) . One exception is the LC4 protein in Chlamydomonas ( Figure 4C , red dotted circle ) . LC4 is a calcium sensor protein of Chlamydomonas OAD and binds to the tail domain of γ - HC ( King & Patel - King , 1995 ; Sakato et al . , 2007 ) . The LC4 orthologue is not found in the vertebrate genome , which is consistent with the lack of corresponding structure in the zebrafish OAD map ( Figure 4C , lower ) . Second , we compared the zebrafish DC structure with other vertebrates . The DC structure was highly conserved among vertebrates , as the bovine DC model ( PDB - 7rro ; Gui et al . , 2021 ) fitted well into the map of zebrafish DC - DMT ( Figure 4D’ ; Video 9 ) . The bovine DC model shows that vertebrate DC is composed of four linker structures : ( a ) Calaxin , ( b ) the Armc4 - TTC25 complex , ( c ) the proximal CCDC151 / 114 , and ( d ) the distal CCDC151 / 114 ( Figure 4E ) . Note that CCDC151 / 114 coiled - coil stretches across the two OAD repeats . The coiled - coil overlaps as its N - terminus region passes between Calaxin and the neighboring distal CCDC151 / 114 ( Figure 4D’ , red dotted circle ) . To visualize the missing component in calaxin - / - OAD , we generated a difference map by subtracting calaxin - / - structure from WT structure ( Figure 4F’ , red ; Video 10 ) . calaxin - / - OADs were attached to DMT through only two linker structures ( Figure 4F ) .

However , the difference map showed an additional missing structure adjacent to Calaxin ( Figure 4F’ , black arrowhead ) . This structure corresponds to the N - terminus region of CCDC151 / 114 , suggesting that Calaxin affects the conformation of neighboring DC components . To test the interaction between Calaxin and other DC components , we performed an in vitro rescue experiment with recombinant Calaxin protein . We incubated the calaxin - / - axonemes with purified Calaxin protein and then observed the OAD structure by cryo - ET . Interestingly , the Calaxin protein autonomously bound to the axoneme and rescued the deficient DC structure ( Figure 4G ) . A difference map visualized the binding of recombinant Calaxin protein ( Figure 4G’ , white arrowhead ) and the re - stabilized structure of the neighboring region of CCDC151 / 114 ( Figure 4G’ , black arrowhead ) . Ectopic binding of the Calaxin protein was not observed . To assess the specificity of Calaxin binding , we also performed a rescue experiment with mEGFP - Calaxin ( Figure 4H - I ) . Ciona Calaxin was reported to interact with β - tubulin ( Mizuno et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting the possible binding of Calaxin along the entire length of the axoneme . However , the rescued axonemes showed partial loss of EGFP signal ( Figure 4H , white arrowheads ) . This pattern resembled the OAD localization of calaxin - / - in immunofluorescence microscopy , suggesting the preferential binding of Calaxin to the remaining OAD - DC . mEGFP alone showed no interaction with the axoneme ( Figure 4H , asterisk ) . A difference map confirmed the binding of mEGFP - Calaxin to DC , as an additional density of mEGFP was observed adjacent to the Calaxin structure ( Figure 4I ) . Calaxin stabilizes the docking of OAD onto DMT calaxin - / - spermatozoa showed loss of distal OAD with unclear boundaries ( Figure 2A , white arrowhead ) . To assess the detailed OAD distribution , we classified the 24 - nm repeat unit of DMT into OAD + and OAD - classes ( Figure 5A ) . A slice of raw tomogram confirmed that particles in OAD + class contain the OAD density ( Figure 5B , blue circles ) , which is not observed in the OAD - class particles ( Figure 5B , red circles ) . We schematically displayed the distributions of two OAD classes using colored grids as individual particles in the tomogram ( Figure 5C - D ) . Note that each tomogram contains only ~ 3 μm of the axoneme , while the total length of sperm flagella is ~ 30 μm . In WT , almost all particles were sorted into OAD + class ( Figure 5C ) . In calaxin - / - , the ratio of OAD + class to OAD - class varied among tomograms ( Figure 5D ) , probably reflecting the different distance from the sperm head . However , all tomograms in calaxin - / - showed multiple clusters of OAD - class , indicating that the OAD loss occurred even in the proximal part of the flagella . Moreover , nine DMTs showed no obvious heterogeneity about the distribution of two OAD classes , suggesting that OAD and Calaxin are localized uniformly on all DMTs . .

We incubated purified calaxin - / - axonemes with or without Calaxin proteins , in buffers containing 50 mM K - acetate as a basis and additional NaCl with different concentrations . Higher NaCl concentrations ( 200 , 250 , or 300 mM ) caused drastic loss of retained OADs in both Calaxin - conditions . However , at lower NaCl concentrations ( 0 , 50 , or 100 mM ) , axonemes incubated with Calaxin retained more OADs than the axonemes without Calaxin , showing that Calaxin contributes to stabilizing the OAD - DMT interaction ( Figure 5E , bottom ) . Importantly , even in buffers with 50 mM K - acetate and 0 mM NaCl , which are generally used to preserve the intact OAD - DMT , calaxin - / - reduced the amount of OADs . This data suggests that the docking of calaxin - / - OADs was so unstable that further OAD dissociations occurred during the incubation . Taken together , we present a model of the stabilizing process of OAD docking onto the DMT ( Figure 5F ) . OADs can bind to DMT through two linkers , which are composed of CCDC151 , CCDC114 , TTC25 , and Armc4 ( Figure 4E ) . The two linkers are insufficient to stabilize the OAD docking and cause the loss of OADs at various regions of the axoneme . Calaxin protein can bind to the pre - existing DC and stabilizes the OAD - DMT interactions as the third linker structure . Although Calaxin was initially identified as a calcium sensor of OAD in Ciona spermatozoa , our study illustrates the additional function of Calaxin as an indispensable component of vertebrate DC . Calaxin requires Armc4 to be localized to cilia Although the above structural analyses showed that Calaxin stabilizes the OAD docking , it is unclear whether Calaxin is transported together with other DC components . To test the idea , we performed immunofluorescence microscopy of multiciliated cells of zebrafish olfactory epithelium ( Figure 6 ) . Axonemal components larger than ~ 50 kDa undergo gated entry into the ciliary compartment after synthesis in the cytoplasm ( Kee et al . , 2012 ; Takao & Verhey , 2016 ) . Multiciliated cells are suitable for distinguishing proteins localized to the cytoplasm , ciliary base , and ciliary compartments . Acetylated - tubulin signals show the ciliary compartment ( Figure 6 , red ) , while DAPI signals indicate the nuclei and the surrounding cytoplasmic regions ( Figure 6 , blue ) . In WT , both Dnah8 and Calaxin were localized in the ciliary compartment ( Figure 6A ) . Dnah8 signals were also observed at the boundary region between the ciliary compartment and cytoplasm , suggesting that OAD components were accumulated underneath the ciliary base before being transported into cilia . In calaxin - / - , Calaxin was absent ( Figure 6B , asterisks ) , but Dnah8 was localized in the ciliary compartment ( Figure 6B ) . In armc4 - / - , both Dnah8 and Calaxin were absent from the ciliary compartment ( Figure 6C ) . Twister ( also known as Pih1d3 ) is one of the DNAAFs and is required for the cytoplasmic OAD pre - assembly . Previously we analyzed the phenotype of twister - / - zebrafish and revealed the complete loss of OAD from . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Consistent with our previous report , twister - / - showed the absence of Dnah8 from the ciliary compartment ( Figure 6D ) . In contrast , Calaxin remained in the ciliary compartment of twister - / - cells , indicating that the ciliary localization of Calaxin is independent of OAD . Interestingly , armc4 - / - cells showed ectopic Calaxin accumulation at the ciliary base ( Figure 6C , white arrowheads ) . The small molecular weight of Calaxin ( ~ 25 kDa ) suggests the possible diffusional entry of Calaxin into the ciliary compartment . However , cytoplasmic accumulation of Calaxin in armc4 - / - cells indicates that Calaxin requires Armc4 to be localized to cilia , implying the transport of DC components as pre - assembled complexes . Vertebrate DC exhibits slight conformation change in the Ca 2 + condition Calaxin modulates the OAD activity in response to the Ca 2 + increase ( Mizuno et al . , 2012 ) . To test whether Ca 2 + induces the change of OAD - DC conformation , we compared the structures of OAD - DC in different Ca 2 + conditions : 1 mM EGTA ( for Ca 2 + - free ; Figure 7A - A’ ) and 1 mM Ca 2 + ( Figure 7B - B’ ) . The structures shown in Figure 7A and A’ are the same as those in Figure 4D and F’ , respectively , since the experiments so far were performed in 1 mM EGTA condition . Although no noticeable difference was observed in the OAD core region , DC exhibited slight conformation changes between Ca 2 + conditions . In 1 mM EGTA condition , the N - terminus region of CCDC151 / 114 was observed ( Figure 7A - A’ , black arrowheads ) , which was not found in 1 mM Ca 2 + condition . In 1 mM Ca 2 + condition , an additional density appeared around DC ( Figure 7B - B’ , white arrowheads ) , which was not found in 1 mM EGTA condition . The corresponding structure to the additional density was not identified in the bovine DC model . We also performed a rescue experiment of calaxin - / - OADs in 1 mM Ca 2 + condition , since Ciona Calaxin was reported to switch its interactor depending on Ca 2 + concentration ( Mizuno et al . , 2009 ; Inaba , 2015 ) . However , we found the normal binding of Calaxin to DC ( Figure 7C - C’ ) , indicating that the Calaxin - DC association is independent of Ca 2 + conditions . .

Calaxin was first identified as a Ca 2 + - dependent OAD regulator in Ciona spermatozoa . Our data revealed a novel function of Calaxin as an indispensable DC component in vertebrates . OADs in calaxin - / - were tethered to DMT through only two linker structures , which were insufficient to stabilize the OAD docking . Calaxin protein rescued the instability of OAD docking as the third linker structure , suggesting the stabilizing process of OAD - DMT docking in vertebrates . calaxin mutation causes partial loss of OAD , unlike other DC component genes calaxin - / - spermatozoa exhibited a unique OAD distribution , with OAD - missing clusters at various regions of the flagella . However , as a whole , OADs decreased gradually toward the distal end , by which the mechanism is unclear . The axoneme is elongated by adding flagellar components to its distal end during ciliogenesis ( Johnson & Rosenbaum , 1992 ) . IFT88 , a component of the IFT machinery , disappears as the spermatozoa mature ( San Agustin et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , we speculate that the OAD supply at the distal sperm axoneme is insufficient to compensate for the OAD dissociation in calaxin - / - . Consistent with this idea , distal OAD loss is the sperm - specific phenotype , as olfactory epithelial cells in calaxin - / - have Dnah8 along the entire length of the cilia ( Figure 6B ) . Unlike calaxin , mutations in other DC component genes cause drastic loss of OAD . Human PCD patients with a mutation of CCDC151 , CCDC114 , or TTC25 lose DNAH5 ( human OAD γ - HC ) from the entire length of respiratory cilia ( Hjeij et al . , 2014 ; Onoufriadis et al . , 2013 ; Wallmeier et al . , 2016 ) . Zebrafish armc4 - / - showed complete loss of OAD in the sperm flagella and olfactory epithelial cilia . Intriguingly , however , human patients with ARMC4 mutation lose DNAH5 only from the distal region of the respiratory cilia ( Hjeij et al . , 2013 ) . One possible explanation for the discrepancy of armc4 - / - phenotypes is the difference in OAD composition between humans and zebrafish . Human respiratory cilia have two OAD types ( Fliegauf et al . , 2005 ; Dougherty et al . , 2016 ) : the proximal DNAH11 / DNAH5 - containing OAD ( type - 1 ) and the distal DNAH9 / DNAH5 - containing OAD ( type - 2 ) . DNAH11 and DNAH9 are the OAD β - HC isoforms . Zebrafish spermatozoa have Dnah9 / Dnah8 along the entire length of flagella . Distal specific loss of DNAH5 in human ARMC4 patients can be correlated with the loss of type - 2 OAD . Moreover , mutation positions differ between human ARMC4 patients and our zebrafish mutant . Most human ARMC4 patients have mutations in the C - terminus regions , suggesting the existence of truncated ARMC4 protein . Actually , immunofluorescence microscopy .

It is possible that the truncated ARMC4 partially incorporates the type - 1 OADs into the proximal respiratory cilia . In contrast , our zebrafish armc4 - / - has a stop - codon in the exon2 , which leaves only 41 amino acids for possible encoding , while zebrafish Armc4 has 1047 amino acids . DC components have different dependencies for ciliary localization The ciliary localization of Calaxin was Armc4 - dependent , suggesting the ciliary targeting of DC components as pre - assembled complexes ( Figure 6C ) . Interestingly , the localization of Armc4 , CCDC151 , CCDC114 , and TTC25 is independent of Calaxin , because the DC components except Calaxin were observed in the calaxin - / - axoneme by cryo - ET . Previous studies also reported the dependencies of DC components for ciliary localization : ARMC4 depends on CCDC114 for its ciliary localization , while CCDC114 localization is independent of ARMC4 ( Hjeij et al . , 2013 ) . TTC25 is required for the ciliary localization of CCDC151 , CCDC114 , and ARMC4 , but TTC25 is localized in the ciliary compartment independent of these DC components ( Wallmeier et al . , 2016 ) . Importantly , TTC25 interacts with IFT complexes ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , we hypothesize that DC components are loaded to IFT in the order of TTC25 , CCDC151 / 114 , Armc4 , and Calaxin , to be transported into the ciliary compartment . The cytoplasmic behavior of DC components remains elusive , compared to the emerging mechanisms of the cytoplasmic OAD pre - assembly ( King , 2021 ; Lee et al . , 2020 ) . Further analysis of the cytoplasmic localization and interaction of DC components could contribute to understanding the mechanism of the ciliary targeting of DC complexes . Ca 2 + induces the conformation change of vertebrate DC In Chlamydomonas , Ca 2 + induces the conformation change of OAD γ - HC , which is correlated with the LC4 function ( Sakato et al . , 2007 ) . LC4 is a calcium sensor protein of Chlamydomonas OAD and binds to the γ - HC tail domain . Vertebrates lack the LC4 orthologue but have Calaxin as a calcium sensor of OAD , suggesting the diverse mechanisms of the Ca 2 + - dependent OAD regulation ( Inaba , 2015 ) . Our cryo - ET analysis confirmed the lack of LC4 structure in the vertebrate OAD ( Figure 4C ) . Consistent with this , Ca 2 + induced no noticeable difference in the vertebrate OAD core region ( Figure 7A - B ) . On the other hand , Ca 2 + induced several conformation changes in the vertebrate DC structure , which can be correlated with the Calaxin function . First , Ca 2 + changed the stability of the N - terminus region of CCDC151 / 114 ( Figure 7A , black arrowheads ) . The stability of the same region was affected by the binding of Calaxin protein ( Figure 4F - G , black arrowheads ) . Second , we found an additional density around the DC in the Ca 2 + condition ( Figure 7B - C , white arrowheads ) . Although the corresponding structure to the additional density is not identified in the bovine DC model , the nearest is the distal region of CCDC151 / 114 , which .

Calaxin can affect the conformation of these components , since the bovine DC model shows that Calaxin binds at the interface between Armc4 and the distal region of CCDC151 / 114 ( Figure 4E ) . Thus , we speculate that Calaxin , as a calcium sensor , modulates the conformation of other DC components in the Ca 2 + condition . Regarding the Calaxin conformation , a previous biochemical analysis reported that Ciona Calaxin switches its interactor depending on Ca 2 + : β - tubulin at lower Ca 2 + concentration and OAD γ - HC at higher Ca 2 + concentration ( Mizuno et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , a crystal structure analysis revealed the conformational transition of Ciona Calaxin toward the closed state by Ca 2 + - binding ( Shojima et al . , 2018 ) . In this study , however , such conformation change of Calaxin was not detected , probably due to insufficient resolution of our cryo - ET analysis . More detailed structural analyses in the Ca 2 + condition are required to understand the mechanism of the Ca 2 + - dependent OAD regulation . . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Immunostaining was performed with monoclonal anti - acetylated tubulin antibody ( 1 : 500 dilution ) and polyclonal antibodies ( 1 : 50 dilution ) as primary antibodies . Fluorescence - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 250 dilution ) were used with 2 . 5 μg / ml DAPI for nuclear staining . Specimens were mounted with Fluoro - KEEPER Antifade Reagent ( Nacalai tesque ) . Sperm samples were observed using a fluorescence microscope ( BX60 , Olympus ) and a CCD camera ( ORCA - R2 , Hamamatsu ) . Multiciliated cell samples were observed using a fluorescence microscope system ( BZ - X700 , Keyence ) . Sperm motility analysis Spermatozoa were kept inactive in cold Hank’s buffer until analyzed and used within 1 hour of sperm collection . Spermatozoa were activated by adding an abundant amount of 1 / 5× Hank’s buffer . Spermatozoa were prepared on the glass slides with 30 μm spacers ( 200A10 , Kyodo giken chemical ) and covered with coverslips to provide a consistent fluid depth . For the observation of free - swimming spermatozoa , 2 mg / ml of BSA ( A9418 , Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to the buffers , which prevented spermatozoa from attaching to the glass surface . For sperm waveform analysis , phase - contrast images of swimming spermatozoa were filmed using a microscope ( BX53 , Olympus ) and a high - speed camera ( Eosens MC1362 , Mikrotron ) at 1000 fps . Sperm heads were tracked with the MTrack2 plugin in ImageJ / Fiji ( NIH ) and overlaid . Traces of flagella waveforms were generated with the AnalyzeSkeleton plugin in ImageJ / Fiji . Shear angles were calculated as tangent angles of the traced flagella and plotted against the distance from the flagellar base . For CASA , phase - contrast images of swimming spermatozoa were filmed using an inverted microscope ( DMI6000B , Leica ) and a high - speed camera ( HAS - L1 , Detect ) at 200 fps . CASA modified for zebrafish was performed as previously reported ( Wilson - Leedy & Ingermann , 2007 ) . Eight independent experiments with two times of 1 - sec observations were performed to obtain sixteen technical replicates of CASA . Calaxin protein purification and rescue assays of calaxin - / - sperm axoneme A full - length zebrafish calaxin sequence was subcloned into pGEX - 6P - 2 vector ( GE Healthcare ) . For the mEGFP - Calaxin protein , monomerized EGFP sequence was inserted into the N - terminus of calaxin sequence of the plasmid . The possible motion of mEGFP tag in the mEGFP - Calaxin was suppressed by removing the linker sequence and the C - terminus . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

GST - tagged recombinant polypeptides were expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) and isolated from the cell lysate using GST - Accept beads ( Nacalai Tesque ) in PBS containing 0 . 2 % Triton - X . GST tags were cleaved by HRV - 3C Protease ( Takara ) , which released the recombinant proteins from the beads . The remaining HRV - 3C Protease was removed by TALON Metal Affinity Resin ( Takara ) . In the rescue assays , 1 μM of each purified recombinant protein was added to calaxin - / - sperm axonemes in HMDEKAc buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice with 5 μM BSA as a blocking agent . Axonemes were washed once by centrifugation ( 5000 g , 3 min ) and buffer exchange . Localization of mEGFP - Calaxin on calaxin - / - sperm axoneme was observed using a fluorescence microscope system ( BZ - X700 , Keyence ) . In Ca 2 + condition analysis , HMDCaKAc buffer ( 30 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 50 mM CH 3 COOK ) was used instead of HMDEKAc buffer . Cryo - preparation of the zebrafish sperm axoneme Purified sperm axonemes were diluted to desired concentrations in HMDEKAc buffer containing 0 . 01 % Nonidet P - 40 . Methylated gold nanoparticles ( final 1 : 2 dilution ; CGM2K - 15 - 25 , Cytodiagnostics ) were added as fiducial markers . Holey carbon grids were glow discharged to make them hydrophilic and then moisturized with a manual blot of 5 μl HMDEKAc buffer containing 0 . 01 % Nonidet P - 40 and 0 . 1 mg / ml BSA . 5 μl of sample solution was loaded onto the grid , and then the excess liquid was removed with filter paper to make a thin film of the solution . Immediately after , the grid was plunged into liquid ethane at −180°C for a rapid freeze . An automated plunge - freezing device ( EM GP , Leica ) was used to perform the blotting and freezing of the grids automatically . For Ca 2 + condition analysis , HMDCaKAc buffer was used instead of HMDEKAc buffer . Grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until the recording sessions with the electron microscope . Cryo - image acquisition and data processing Cryo - images were recorded using a Krios G3i microscope ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 300 keV , a K3 direct electron detector ( Gatan ) in the electron counting mode , and a Quantum - LS Energy Filter ( Gatan ) with a slit width of 35 eV . The magnification was set to ×15 , 000 , which has a physical pixel size of 6 . 14 Å / pixel . Tilt series were acquired using the SerialEM software ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) with the following settings : target defocus of 5 - 8 μm , angular range from −55° to 55° with 2 . 5° increments , image acquisition with 16 - 21 movie frames , and total electron dose of ~ 110 electrons / Å 2 . Beam - induced motion in each movie was corrected using the MotionCor2 software ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) . Alignment , CTF correction , and back - projection of the tilt series images were performed using the IMOD software ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) to generate the reconstructed 3D tomograms . During the initial process of subtomographic averaging , tomograms were 4×binned to reduce . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Positions of each DMT were manually tracked using the 3dmod model tool ( IMOD software ) , and initial particle positions were placed at about 48 nm intervals on the DMT . Alignment was performed using the PEET software ( Nicastro et al . , 2006 ) with volumes of 60×60×60 voxels in the 4×binned tomograms . The reported zebrafish DMT structure ( EMD - 6954 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2018 ) was used as the initial reference . Duplicates of aligned subtomogram positions were removed at the end of the alignment process . Based on the aligned coordinates and rotation angles of the 4×binned subtomograms , local refinement was performed in the unbinned tomograms using the PEET software again . For the refined structures of the 96 - nm repeat of DMT , subtomograms were subdivided into four parts ( DMT with axonemal dyneins , RS1 , RS2 , and RS3 ) , and local alignment and averaging was performed individually . Obtained maps were aligned using the UCSF Chimera software ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) and combined using the EMAN2 software ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) as described in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 . For refined OAD structures , four OAD repeats were extracted from the subtomograms , and then local alignment and averaging were performed . Difference maps of OAD - DC were generated by subtracting calaxin - / - structure from each sample using the EMAN2 software , displayed with the same threshold of isosurface rendering . The structural classification was performed on the aligned subtomograms , using the PCA ( principal component analysis ) and the k - means clustering method , which are built into the PEET software ( Heumann et al . , 2011 ) . The resolutions of the resulting structures were determined by Fourier shell correlation with a cutoff value of 0 . 5 . The tomographic slice and averaged structures were visualized using the 3dmod program ( IMOD software ) and the isosurface rendering of the UCSF Chimera software , respectively . Immunoblot analysis Purified calaxin - / - sperm axonemes were incubated for 30 min on ice with or without 1 μM recombinant Calaxin protein in different salt concentration buffers , which were generated by adding 0 , 50 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , or 300 mM of NaCl to HMDEKAc buffer containing 0 . 01 % Nonidet P - 40 and 5 μM BSA as a blocking agent . Axonemes were collected by centrifugation ( 10000 g , 3 min ) and dissolved in SDS sample buffer , followed by protein denaturation at 95°C for 3 min . Proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE in 5 - 20 % gradient gels ( Extra PAGE One Precast Gel , Nacalai Tesque ) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes ( Millipore ) . After blocking with 5 % skim milk ( Nacalai Tesque ) in TBST ( Tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) , membranes were incubated with primary antibodies of monoclonal anti - acetylated tubulin antibody ( 1 : 5000 dilution ) and polyclonal antibodies ( 1 : 400 dilution ) , followed by several washes and incubation with peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 5000 dilution ) . Blots were visualized by ECL Select Western Blotting Detection Reagent ( GE Healthcare ) and observed using a luminescent image analyzer ( ImageQuant LAS4000mini , GE Healthcare ) . Blot signals were quantified by . CC - BY - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Antibodies Mouse monoclonal anti - acetylated tubulin antibody ( T6793 , Sigma - Aldrich ) was used to visualize or quantify the zebrafish axoneme . Other primary antibodies are as follows : rabbit polyclonal anti - Dnah8 antibody ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2018 ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - Dnah2 antibody ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2018 ) , and guinea pig polyclonal anti - Calaxin antibody ( Sasaki et al . , 2019 ; referred to as anti - Efcab1 antibody ) . Polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified from serum by the antigens before use . For immunofluorescence microscopy , the following secondary antibodies were used ; goat anti - rabbit IgG antibody AlexaFluor488 ( A - 11008 , Invitrogen ) , goat anti - guinea pig IgG antibody AlexaFluor488 ( A - 11073 , Invitrogen ) , goat anti - mouse IgG antibody AlexaFluor555 ( A - 21422 , Invitrogen ) , and goat anti - guinea pig IgG antibody AlexaFluor647 ( A - 21450 , Invitrogen ) . For immunoblot analysis , the following secondary antibodies were used ; goat anti - mouse IgG antibody peroxidase - conjugated ( A4416 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , goat anti - rabbit IgG antibody peroxidase - conjugated ( A0545 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , and goat anti - guinea pig IgG antibody peroxidase - conjugated ( A7289 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Statistics Data with biological / technical replicates were shown using the box - and - whisker plots . The box corresponds to the first and third quartiles , the line inside the box indicates the median , and the whiskers extend to the full range of the data . In Kupffer’s vesicle cilia analysis , statistical significance was tested by Welch’s t - test . In sperm motility analysis , statistical significances were tested by Tukey - Kramer multiple comparison test . p - value < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate a significant difference . .
