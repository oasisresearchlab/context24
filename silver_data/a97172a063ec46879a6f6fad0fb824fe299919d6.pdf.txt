Cisse 1 † Models of gene control have emerged from genetic and biochemical studies , with limited consideration of the spatial organization and dynamics of key components in living cells . We usedlive - cellsuperresolutionandlight - sheetimagingtostudytheorganizationanddynamicsof the Mediator coactivator and RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) directly . Mediator and Pol II each form small transient and large stable clusters in living embryonic stem cells . Mediator and Pol II are colocalized in the stable clusters , which associate with chromatin , have properties of phase - separated condensates , and are sensitive to transcriptional inhibitors . We suggest that large clusters of Mediator , recruited by transcription factors at large or clustered enhancer elements , interact with large Pol II clusters in transcriptional condensates in vivo . A conventional view of eukaryotic gene reg - ulation is that transcription factors , bound to enhancer DNA elements , recruit co - activators such as the Mediator complex , which is thought to interact with RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) at the promoter ( 1 – 5 ) . This model is supported by a large body of molecular genetic and biochemical evidence , yet the direct interaction of Mediator and Pol II has not been observed and characterized in living cells ( 6 ) . Using superresolution ( 7 – 9 ) and light - sheetimag - ing ( 10 ) , we studied the organization and dy - namics of endogenous Mediator and Pol II in live mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) . We directly tested whether Pol II and Mediator in - teract in a manner consistent with condensate formation ( 11 – 13 ) , quantitatively characterized their biophysical properties , and considered the implications of these observations for transcrip - tion regulation in living mammalian cells . To visualize Mediator and Pol II in live cells , we generated mESC lines with endogenous Mediator and Pol II labeled with Dendra2 , a green - to - red photoconvertible fluorescent pro - tein ( materials and methods and figs . S1 and S2 ) . We performed live - cell superresolution imaging and found that Mediator forms clusters ( Fig . 1A and fig . S3 ) with a range of dynamic temporal signatures . Mediator exists in a population of transient small ( ~ 100 nm ) clusters ( Fig . 1B ) with an average lifetime of 11 . 1 ± 0 . 9 s ( mean ± SEM from 36 cells ) ( Fig . 1G ) , comparable to that of transient Pol II clusters observed in this study ( Fig . 1 , D , E , and H ) and previously in differ - entiated cell types ( 14 , 15 ) . In addition , we ob - served that both Mediator and Pol II form a population of large ( > 300 nm ) clusters ( ~ 14 per cell ) , each comprising ~ 200 to 400 molecules , that are temporally stable ( lasting the full ac - quisition window of the live - cell superresolution imaging ) ( Fig . 1 , C and F to H , and figs . S4 to S6 ) . We tested the extent to which these clusters depend on the stem cell state . The mESCs were subjected to a protocol ( 16 ) to differentiate them into epiblastlike cells ( EpiLCs ) within 24 h ( ma - terials and methods and fig . S7 ) . Differentiation had no apparent effect on the population of tran - sient clusters , consistent with previous observa - tionsthattransientclusterspersistindifferentiatedcelltypes ( 14 , 15 ) . However , both the size and the number of stable clusters decreased along the course of differentiation ( fig . S8 ) , suggesting that these stable clusters are prone to change as cells differentiate . We focused on the stable clusters of Mediator and Pol II and investigated whether they are colocalized . We generated mESCs with endog - enous Mediator and Pol II tagged with JF646 - HaloTag ( 15 , 17 ) and Dendra2 , respectively ( materials and methods and figs . S1 and S2 ) . Direct imaging of both JF646 - Mediator ( Fig . 2A ) and Dendra2 – Pol II ( Fig . 2B ) showed bright spots of large accumulations in the nucleus , which corresponded to stable Pol II clusters accord - ing to subsequent superresolution imaging of Dendra2 – Pol II in the same nuclei ( Fig . 2C ) . The same observations were made with Dendra2 - Mediator ( fig . S9 ) . Of143Mediatorclustersimaged by dual - color light - sheet imaging ( Fig . 2 , D to F ) , 129 ( 90 % ) had a colocalizing Pol II cluster ( Fig . 2 , G and H ; materials and methods ; and fig . S9 ) . We conclude thatthese Mediator and Pol II clus - ters colocalize in live mESCs . Previous studies have shown that high den - sities of Mediator are located at enhancer clusters called super - enhancers ( SEs ) and that some are RESEARCH Cho et al . , Science 361 , 412 – 415 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 1 of 4 1 Department of Physics , MIT , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA . 2 Department of Biology , MIT , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA . 3 Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research , Cambridge , MA 02139 , USA . 4 Department of Physics , LMU Munich , Geschwister Scholl Platz 1 , 80539 Munich , Germany . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † Corresponding author .

We found that treatment of mESCs with JQ1 , a drug that causes loss of BRD4 from enhancer chromatin , dissolved transient and stable clusters of both Mediator and Pol II clusters ( Fig . 2 , I to N , and fig . S10 ) . After transcription initiation , Pol II transcribes a short distance ( ~ 100 base pairs ) , pauses , and is released to continue elongation when phos - phorylated by CDK9 ( 20 ) . We hypothesized that inhibitionofCDK9mightselectivelyaffectthePolIIstableclusters . We observed that upon incubation with DRB ( 5 , 6 - dichloro - 1 - beta - D - ribofuranosyl - benzimidazole ) , Pol II stable clusters dissolved but Mediator stable clusters remained ( Fig . 2O ) . Quantification of Mediator – Pol II colocalization revealed that incubation with DRB progressively decreasedthefractionofMediatorstableclusters that colocalized with Pol II ( Fig . 2P ) . This effect could be reversed when DRB was washed out ; the colocalization fraction recovered completely . These results imply that the association be - tween Mediator and Pol II clusters may be hierarchical , with upstream enhancer recruit - ment controlling both clusters but downstream transcription inhibition selectively affecting Pol II clusters . We characterized the long - term dynamics of stable clusters by using lattice light - sheet imag - inginlivemESCs ( moviesS1andS2 ) . Weobserved that clusters can merge upon contact ( Fig . 3 , A to D , and movies S1 and S2 ) . The time scale of coalescence was very rapid , comparable to our full volumetric acquisition frame rate ( 15 - s time interval ) . The added - up intensity of the two pre - cursor clusters was close to that of the newly merged cluster ( Fig . 3E and fig . S11 ) . These bio - physical dynamics are reminiscent of those of biomolecular condensates in vivo ( 21 ) . Inadditiontocoalescence , invivocondensates had rapid turnover of the molecular components , as shown by fast recovery in fluorescence re - covery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) assays , and were sensitive to a nonspecific aliphatic alcohol , 1 , 6 - hexanediol ( 21 ) . Our FRAP analyses of clus - ters revealed very rapid dynamics and turnover of their components : 60 % of the Mediator and 90 % of Pol II components were exchanged within ~ 10 s within clusters ( Fig . 3 , F to H ) . Moreover , the treatment of mESCs with 1 , 6 - hexanediol resulted in the gradual dissolution of both Me - diator and Pol II clusters ( Fig . 3 , I to K , and fig . S12 ) . Together , theseresultssuggestthatthestable clusters are in vivo condensates of Mediator and Pol II . We hypothesized that a phase separation model with induced condensation at the recruit - ment step of Mediator to enhancers would qual - itatively account for the observations in this study ( 22 ) . The model implies that the conden - sates are chromatin associated and colocalize with enhancer - controlled active genes . We there - fore tested these two specific implications . We tracked the diffusion dynamics of Mediator clus - ters by computing their mean squared displace - ment as a function of time ( n = 6 cells ) . On short time scales , the cluster motion was subdiffusive , Cho et al . , Science 361 , 412 – 415 ( 2018 ) 27 July 2018 2 of 4 Fig . 2 .

This is the same exponent found in the subdiffusional behavior of chromatin loci in eukaryotic cells ( 23 – 27 ) . We also observed the same diffusional parameters when tracking a chromatin locus labeled by dCas9 - based chi - meric array of guide RNA oligonucleotides ( CARGO ) in mESCs ( fig . S13 ) ( 23 ) . We concluded that clusters diffuse like chromatin - associated domains . We hypothesized that clusters were in close physical proximity to actively transcribed genes that can be visualized by global run - on nascent RNAlabelingwithethynyluridine ( EU ) ( fig . S14 ) . The run - on results showed that 2 min after DRB washout , virtually all Mediator clusters observed were proximal or overlapping with nascent RNA accumulations , as imaged by Click labeling of EU in fixed cells ( fig . S14 ) . We also employed the MS2 endogenous RNA labeling system ( 15 , 28 ) ( materials and methods and fig . S15 ) to investi - gate whether active transcription could be ob - served at Esrrb , one of the top SE - controlled genes in mESCs ( 29 ) ( Fig . 4A ) . We observed bright foci consistent with nascent MS2 - labeled gene loci and confirmed the gene loci by dual - color RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) targeting the MS2 sequence and intronic regions of Esrrb ( fig . S16 ) . Intronic FISH on 125 Esrrb loci from 82 fixed cells showed that 93 % of Esrrb loci had a stable Mediator cluster nearby ( within 1 m m ) but only ~ 22 % of the loci co - localized with a stable Mediator cluster , suggest - ing that the Mediator - bound enhancer only occasionally colocalizes with the gene ( fig . S17 ) . The variability in colocalization may be explained by a dynamic “ kissing ” model , where a distal Mediator cluster colocalizes with the gene only at certain time points ( Fig . 4A ) . By dual - color three - dimensional ( 3D ) live - cell imaging with lattice light - sheet microscopy , we found that some Mediator clusters were up to a micrometer away from the active Esrrb gene locus but in some instances directly colocalized with the gene ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . In addition , we directly observed the dynamic interaction be - tween Mediator clusters and the gene locus , sup - porting the dynamic kissing model ( Fig . 4 , D and E ; fig . S18 ; and movie S3 ) . Tracking of loci in all six cells indicated that colocalization below our resolution limit of 300 nm occurred at ~ 30 % of the time points ( Fig . 4F ) . However , even when they were not overlapping , the Mediator cluster and the gene loci moved as a pair through the nucleus ( movie S3 ) , consistent with two adjacent regions anchoring to the same underlying chro - matindomain . WeproposethatMediatorclusters form at the Esrrb SE and then interact occa - sionally and transiently with the transcription apparatus at the Esrrb promoter . We have found that Mediator and Pol II form largestableclustersinlivingcellsandhaveshownthattheseclustershavepropertiesexpectedfor biomolecular condensates . Thecondensateprop - erties were evident through coalescence , rapid recovery in FRAP analysis , and sensitivity to hexanediol . In a model of phase separation on the basis of scaffold - client relationships ( 30 ) , it is possible that enhancer - associated Mediator forms a condensate and provides a “ scaffold ” for “ client ” RNA Pol II molecules .

RESEARCH | REPORT enhancers transiently kiss the transcription ap - paratus at promoters has a number of implica - tions for gene control mechanisms . The presence of large Mediator clusters at some enhancers may allow Mediator condensates to contact the transcription apparatus at multiple gene pro - moters simultaneously . The large size of the Mediator clusters may also mean that the ef - fective distance of the enhancer - promoter DNA elements can be in the same order as the size of the clusters ( > 300 nm ) , larger than the distance requirementfordirectcontact . Wespeculatethat such clusters may help explain gaps of hundreds of nanometers that are found in previous studies measuringdistancesbetweenfunctionalenhancer - promoter DNA elements . Such cluster sizes also implythatsomelong - rangeinteractionscouldgo undetected in DNA interaction assays that de - pend on much closer physical proximity of en - hancer and promoter DNA elements .
