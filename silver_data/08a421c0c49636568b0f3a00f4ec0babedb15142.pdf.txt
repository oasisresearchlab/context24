H . pylori infects about 50 % of humans ( more than 3 billion people ) , with a prevalence as high as 90 % in some developing nations [ 3 - 5 ] . Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide [ 6 ] . H . pylori - associated gastric adenocarcinoma is a rare example of a human cancer attributed to a specific bacterial infection , a connection that led the World Health Organization to classify H . pylori as a type 1 carcinogen . One of the major virulence factors secreted by H . pylori is the pore - forming exotoxin VacA ( vacuolating cytotoxin A ) , named for its ability to induce the formation of large vacuoles in eukaryotic cells [ 7 ] . VacA causes multiple cellular effects that include cell vacuolation , depolarization of membrane potential , mitochondrial dysfunction , autophagy , cell death , activation of mitogen - activated protein kinases , and inhibition of T cell activities [ 8 , 9 ] . Most VacA - induced cellular alterations require oligomerization of the toxin [ 10 - 12 ] , insertion into the lipid bilayer to form a membrane channel [ 13 - 16 ] , and internalization into the cell [ 17 - 19 ] . The molecular mechanisms underlying each of these steps and the order in which they occur are not understood . Although there is no crystal structure of the holotoxin , there is a 2 . 4 Å three - dimensional ( 3D ) structure of part of the p55 domain by X - ray crystallography [ 20 ] and we have characterized the 3D “snowflake” - like structures of VacA oligomers at ~ 15 Å resolution by negative stain electron microscopy ( EM ) [ 21 ] . In order to form a functional anion - specific channel , VacA must oligomerize and insert into the lipid bilayer . However , the mechanisms by which these steps occur are not fully understood . The structural organization of membrane - bound VacA has not been characterized in any detail and the role ( s ) of specific VacA domains in membrane binding and insertion are unclear . Using a combination of single particle electron microscopy and biochemical techniques our work shows that membrane - bound VacA organizes into hexameric oligomers ( Figure 1 ) . Comparison of the two - dimensional averages of membrane - bound and soluble VacA hexamers generated using single particle electron microscopy reveals a structural difference in the central region of the oligomers ( corresponding to the p33 domain ) , suggesting that membrane association triggers a structural change in the p33 domain . Analyses of the isolated p55 domain and VacA variants demonstrate that while the p55 domain can bind membranes , the p33 domain is required for membrane insertion . Surprisingly , neither VacA oligomerization nor the presence of putative transmembrane GXXXG repeats in the p33 domain is required for membrane insertion . These findings provide new insights into the process by which VacA binds and inserts into the lipid bilayer to form membrane channels . 1238doi : 10 . 1017 / S1431927617006857 Microsc .
