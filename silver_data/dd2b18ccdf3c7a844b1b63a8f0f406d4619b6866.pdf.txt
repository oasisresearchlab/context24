The increasing dominance of grant - supported research in shaping scientific advances 8 – 16 , combined with growing interest in funding interdisciplinary work 2 , 7 , 14 , 17 – 20 , raises fundamental questions regarding the role of interdisciplinary grants in supporting high - impact interdisciplinary advances . Here , we develop a general measurement framework to quantify the interdisciplinarity of both research grants and publications . We then apply it to 350 , 000 grants from 164 funding agencies across 26 countries and 1 . 3 million papers that acknowledged the support of these grants from 1985 to 2009 . Our analysis uncovers two seemingly contradictory patterns . On the one hand , interdisciplinary grants tend to produce interdisciplinary papers , and highly interdisciplinary papers are associated with high impacts . Yet , on the other hand , compared with their disciplinary counterparts , interdisciplinary grants , on average , produce much fewer papers , and interdisciplinary papers that they support tend to have substantially reduced impact . We demonstrate that the key to resolving this discrepancy lies in the power of disciplinary 2 grants in propelling high - impact interdisciplinary advances . Specifically , we find that highly interdisciplinary papers supported by deeply disciplinary grants garner disproportionately high impacts from not only their core disciplines but also broader fields . Further , the broad and deep impacts of disciplinary grants are not simply a consequence of funding size , reception of ideas within disciplinary boundaries , or collaborative formats . Instead , we find that when it comes to producing key interdisciplinary advances , disciplinary grants appear to do more with less and seem especially powerful when paired with other similarly disciplinary grants . Amidst the rapid rise of support for interdisciplinary work across the sciences , these results highlight the underexplored role of disciplinary grants in driving crucial interdisciplinary advances , suggesting that interdisciplinary research is a risky endeavor and requires deep disciplinary expertise and investments . Many scientific challenges today require interdisciplinary approaches that integrate expertise and resources across diverse perspectives 1 – 3 , 5 , 7 . Amidst the rapid growth in scale and complexity of the modern scientific enterprise 2 , 3 , 21 , and the narrowing of individual expertise 22 , 23 , funding agencies and policymakers increasingly design granting mechanisms and programs to support interdisciplinary work 1 , 2 , 14 , 19 . Although funding plays a critical role in propelling scientific progress , our knowledge of how interdisciplinary grants shape the interdisciplinary research landscape remains limited . Yet such understanding is essential for more productively supporting high - impact interdisciplinary endeavors , especially given the ensuing debates about the risks and benefits of interdisciplinary work among individual researchers and research institutions 6 , 19 , 24 , 25 . Our paper builds on two related but separate streams of research to consider the role of interdisciplinary grants in supporting high - impact interdisciplinary advances . Prior research shows the rising relevance of interdisciplinary work and its positive impacts across scientific disciplines 7 , 20 , 26 27 – 30 , by developing measures to quantify the levels of interdisciplinarity of research papers 29 – 32 . At the same time , scholars have begun to examine the relationship between grants and their research outputs 33 – 35 . While often relying on data from a single agency or country 13 , 36 , 37 , these studies generally highlight the increasing importance of funding in propelling scientific progress in an era of big science 8 , 33 and growing fiscal scarcity 38 . While developing concomitantly , these two lines of research highlight an important gap in understanding the 3 relationship between interdisciplinary grants and the high - impact interdisciplinary advances they support . To fill this gap , we develop a new measurement approach to quantify the interdisciplinarity of both research grants and publications within a unified framework . We then apply this framework to 350 , 000 grants from 164 funding agencies across 26 countries and 1 . 3 million papers that acknowledged the support of these grants from 1985 to 2009 ( see Methods for more details ) , allowing us to systematically examine the longitudinal changes in interdisciplinarity for both research grants and papers across disciplines as well as the relationships between grant interdisciplinarity and the publications they support . Specifically , we combine two large - scale publication and citation databases . We first use the Dimensions database 39 , capturing more than 110 million publications , which acknowledged the support of more than 5 million research grants worldwide . We then combine the information on grants and papers with the Microsoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) 40 dataset , containing more than 250 million research papers with standardized scientific field annotations for each paper . To assign grants from different agencies to research fields in one coherent framework , we use field classifications of papers and their abstracts in the MAG dataset ( Fig . 1a ) to learn text representations of each scientific field ( Fig . 1b ) using a Labeled - Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach ( Labeled - LDA ; see Methods ) . The Labeled - LDA approach allows us to estimate word associations for each field that enable us to calculate the probabilities that a grant is associated with scientific fields based on its abstract ( Fig . 1c ) . We validate our model through various approaches , including both human ratings and out - of - sample predictions , and find that the model output is highly reliable ( see Supplementary Note 1 ) . To compute the probability that a given publication is associated with a given field , we use the paper’s references or its citations ( Fig . 1d ) . Here , we follow prior work , which has developed measures of interdisciplinarity by analyzing patterns of paper references as a proxy of inspiration or citations as a gauge for the appeal of a publication 20 , 26 , 29 – 32 . We then quantify the level of interdisciplinarity of individual publications and grants on a scale of zero to one , using the Rao - Stirling diversity 20 , 41 . Such a measure of interdisciplinarity incorporates three sets of information ( Fig . 1f ) , including the number of research fields ( volume ; Fig . 1c , d ) , their relative distribution ( balance ; Fig . 1c , d ) , and their differences ( disparity ; Fig . 1e ) . Overall , these data and measurements offer us a unique opportunity to study interdisciplinary grants and papers at a high scale . 4 We find an overall increasing trend in interdisciplinary research across the sciences over the past 25 years ( Fig . 2a and Fig . S1 ) , in line with previous studies 7 , 20 . In particular , since the mid - 1990s , papers that acknowledge grant support feature a higher level of interdisciplinarity , highlighting the relevant role of funding in supporting interdisciplinary work . To this end , we focus on grant - supported publications and examine 2 , 213 , 187 grant - paper pairs , containing 1 , 293 , 934 publications and 350 , 526 supporting grants . Here , we uncover two seemingly contradictory patterns . On the one hand , we find that more interdisciplinary grants tend to produce papers that are more interdisciplinary ( Fig . 2b and Fig . S2 ) , and papers with a higher level of interdisciplinarity tend to be associated with higher impacts ( Fig . 2c ) . Indeed , papers that acknowledge the support from interdisciplinary grants tend to draw knowledge from disparate fields ( Fig . 2b ) and attract citations from broad fields ( inset , Fig . 2b ) . Calculating the paper - level hit rate , defined as the probability that a paper is in the top 5 % of citations in the same field and year 42 , we find that highly interdisciplinary papers tend to be more impactful ( Fig . 2c and Fig . S3 ) . Notably , these patterns suggest that interdisciplinary grants appear to fulfill their premise of producing high - impact interdisciplinary advances 19 , 27 , 28 . On the other hand , however , we surprisingly find that interdisciplinary grants produce fewer papers on average compared to their disciplinary counterparts ( Fig . 2d ) . Moreover , despite the overall impact premium for interdisciplinary papers ( Fig . 2c ) , when papers acknowledge the support of interdisciplinary grants , these papers tend to have substantially reduced impact ( Fig . 2e ) . We confirm the robustness of these results over different sample frames , concerning funding agencies , time periods , and countries ( see Supplementary Note 3 ) . Overall , these results paint a more nuanced picture of the productivity of interdisciplinary grants , suggesting that interdisciplinary papers supported by interdisciplinary grants appear to feature different characteristics than interdisciplinary papers in general . Together , the results in Fig . 2 highlight the importance of considering the interdisciplinary orientation of both grants and papers , prompting us to next examine the joint distribution of grant - paper pairs . Figure 3a categorizes grant - paper pairs based on the interdisciplinary orientations of papers and their supporting grants and plots the average hit rate of papers in each category as a heat map . While the hit rate tends to increase as the paper interdisciplinarity increases ( Fig . 2c and Fig . S3 ) , we find that the highest - impact papers appear to concentrate on the upper left corner in Fig . 3a , indicating that interdisciplinary papers supported by disciplinary grants tend to garner 5 disproportionately high impacts . Interdisciplinary papers supported by disciplinary grants may be highly selected ones as disciplinary grants are less likely to produce interdisciplinary papers ( Fig . 2b and Fig . S2 ) . However , we still observe that the impact of papers systematically declines as the interdisciplinarity of the supporting grants increases , controlling for the level of paper interdisciplinarity ( Fig . 3b and Fig . S4 ) . We further split our samples by different funding agencies , time periods , and countries , confirming the robustness of these results ( see Supplementary Note 3 ) . Overall , amidst the concomitant rise of interdisciplinary research and interdisciplinary funding , this result suggests that disciplinary grants appear to play an especially important role in producing high - impact interdisciplinary advances . Such counter - intuitive results prompt us to wonder why disciplinary grants are seemingly more successful in producing high - impact interdisciplinary papers . One possibility is that disciplinary grants , born out of more established funding mechanisms 1 , 14 , tend to have larger funding and therefore are more likely to produce higher - impact work . Comparing the size of funding for disciplinary and interdisciplinary grants , we instead find that interdisciplinary grants tend to have a larger funding size than disciplinary grants ( Fig . 4a ) , consistent with the literature 43 . Moreover , the productivity and impact differences between disciplinary and interdisciplinary grants become especially pronounced conditional on the size of funding . Specifically , for both large - ( Fig . 4b ) and medium - sized ( Fig . 4c ) granting mechanisms , the average number of papers ( purple ) and hit rate of supported papers ( orange ) sharply decrease as the grant interdisciplinarity increases . Another potential explanation for the impact of disciplinary grants centers around the reception of ideas within disciplinary boundaries . For example , papers that result from deeply disciplinary grants may enjoy home - field advantages that help them acquire more citations . To this end , we trace the top and bottom 25 % of papers ranked by their interdisciplinarity as well as the top and bottom 25 % of supporting grants ranked by their interdisciplinarity . We then count the average number of citations that papers garnered from within and outside of their own field . Indeed , we find that papers supported by disciplinary grants ( top and bottom left ) do enjoy a home - field advantage in that those papers collect more citations from their own field ( Fig . 4d ) . Yet , interdisciplinary publications supported by disciplinary grants ( top left ) tend to garner higher impact not only from their core disciplines but also from broad and distant fields , suggesting that 6 interdisciplinary papers produced by disciplinary grants are associated with both deep and broad impacts in science . Finally , as teams are increasingly responsible for producing high - impact advances 22 , 42 , 44 – 48 , we examine the organizations of collaborative grants and ask whether there are certain collaborative formats that may be particularly suited for the production of high - impact interdisciplinary papers . For example , highly disciplinary grants from distant disciplines may come together to create interdisciplinary synergy by covering wide areas with deep disciplinary expertise . To test this hypothesis , we consider papers that acknowledge support from multiple grants and compute the average level of interdisciplinarity and the average disciplinary distance between supporting grants for each of those papers . By ranking papers according to these interdisciplinarity and distance scores , we compare four types of collaborative formats : proximate disciplinary grants ; distant disciplinary grants ; proximate interdisciplinary grants ; and distant interdisciplinary grants ( from left to right in Fig . 4e ) . We find that the resulting interdisciplinary papers are the most influential when they are supported by multiple disciplinary grants that are proximate in their intellectual space . By contrast , the impact of papers decreases when their supporting grants are disciplinary grants that are more distant from each other . The impact further lowers when papers result from collaborations of interdisciplinary grants that are distant from each other . These patterns are robust after controlling for a range of funding - and author - level factors ( see Supplementary Note 2 ) as well as the differences in funding agencies , time periods , and countries ( see Supplementary Note 3 ) . Overall , such observations suggest that the increased propensity of disciplinary grants producing high - impact interdisciplinary papers is not a consequence of multiple disciplinary grants balanced over different knowledge domains ; rather , research supports and programs backed with closely - related disciplinary grants tend to produce the most impactful interdisciplinary work . Taken together , our results show that the broad and deep impacts of disciplinary grants are not simply due to funding size , reception of ideas within disciplinary boundaries , or collaborative formats . Instead , in regard to producing key interdisciplinary advances , disciplinary grants appear to do more with less and seem especially powerful when paired with other closely related disciplinary grants . Despite their correlational nature that does not allow causal interpretations , our findings are consistent with the view that “narrow work has broad impact” 20 and further emphasize the growing advantage of deep disciplinary expertise in the ambit of research 22 , 49 . At the same 7 time , amidst the broad shifts toward interdisciplinary research across the sciences 7 , 20 , 26 , our results highlight the enduring challenges of interdisciplinary work , suggesting that the fruits of interdisciplinary programs are not always guaranteed . While interdisciplinary grants appear to produce intended outcomes ( i . e . , papers with high interdisciplinarity ) , we in fact find that highly interdisciplinary grants tend to produce fewer papers and see a reduced probability of producing highly impactful papers , despite having larger funding on average . While unveiling the often - overlooked role of disciplinary grants in producing key interdisciplinary insights , our findings further reflect the substantial costs and risks of interdisciplinary research , highlighting the need to manage tensions among different disciplinary and professional approaches ( for research communities ) and integrating deep disciplinary expertise in driving interdisciplinary work ( for individual researchers and teams ) . Challenges might arise in particular from the difficulties in collaborative relationships 50 – 52 , developing a common language 51 , 53 , 54 , and focusing on a shared perspective from disparate viewpoints , cultures , and traditions 1 , 53 , 55 , 56 . The power of disciplinary grants in producing interdisciplinary advances that garner deep and broad impacts , therefore , raises key questions for academics , funders , and policymakers regarding how best to unleash the full potential of interdisciplinary research and programs . Methods Dataset of research grants and articles . The Dimensions dataset 39 contains more than 110 million publications that were supported by more than 5 million worldwide grants from 1665 to 2021 . In this study , we focus on grants that were awarded after 1985 . In total , we obtain 1 , 293 , 934 papers that were published before 2009 with at least one reference and one citation and had received support from one of the 350 , 526 grants that were awarded in this timeframe . Overall , these papers and grants cover 292 research fields and 164 funding agencies across 26 countries . We further complement this dataset with abstract , field of study label , and reference and citation information from corresponding papers by merging the Dimensions data with the Microsoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) dataset 40 . Fields of study . In this study , we use the scientific categories information contained in the MAG dataset 40 , which assigns each paper to at least one research field using a four - level hierarchical classification . Specifically , we associate each publication with 292 level - 1 fields , which are 8 comparable to the granularity level of classifications commonly used in other popular bibliographic databases such as the Web of Science ( WoS ) . Relevance of a research grant across disciplines ( Labeled - LDA ) . A key empirical challenge in quantifying the interdisciplinarity of grants is to estimate the potential disciplines to which a research grant belongs . Here , we develop a new method using Labeled - LDA 57 , allowing us to estimate the probabilities that a given grant is associated to a scientific field based on its abstract . In particular , we train our model using 572 , 302 paper abstracts and their corresponding field of study labels , which we obtained through random sampling of 1 million papers from the MAG and excluding papers without a minimum abstract length of 100 characters and a level - 1 field label . The resulting model constructs a one - to - one correspondence between latent topics and labels , allowing us to learn a word - label ( i . e . , word - field ) distribution . We validate our model through manual inspections on field - word associations as well as out - of - sample classification tasks ( see Supplementary Note 1 ) . In addition , the distances between disciplines determined by Labeled - LDA and citation patterns ( described below ) are highly similar ( Pearson’s r = 0 . 451 , P < 0 . 001 ) , further confirming the reliability of our model . Applied to individual grant abstracts , the Labeled - LDA model allows us to estimate the probabilities that a grant belongs to a scientific field . Additionally , for each grant , we re - normalize the probabilities while considering those fields with the lowest probability score as irrelevant fields , i . e . , assigning zero probability , to create variations in the number of relevant fields . We stress that such an estimation of field probabilities of grants is comparable to the vector of probabilities that a publication is associated with research fields as described below . Relevance of a paper across disciplines ( reference and citation ) . Following previous research 20 , 26 , we used references to identify interdisciplinary inspiration and citations to determine the interdisciplinary impact of a paper . We first represent each publication by a vector over 292 scientific fields , p . By considering all references of a paper , we compute the paper’s probability to belong to discipline i ( p i ) as a fraction of references that are associated with discipline i . We apply the same process when we consider citations of a paper . Distance between disciplines . As scientific disciplines vary in their proximity , we compute the distance between disciplines by estimating the overall knowledge stock within a discipline . In particular , we consider the cumulative reference or citation vectors v i over a set of n papers within the discipline i , where 𝑣 ! = # 𝑝 " , ! , … , 𝑝 $ , ! ’ . The distance , d ij , is then defined as the cosine distance 9 between disciplines i ( v i ) and j ( v j ) , 𝑑 ! % = 1 − & ! ∙ & " | & ! | ∙ | & " | . Here , disciplines whose papers have very similar reference or citation patterns have a small distance d ij ≈ 0 , while disciplines whose papers have very different reference or citation patterns have a large distance d ij ≈ 1 . Using a M × N discipline proportion matrix of p i values ( for each row , i . e . , paper , ∑ 𝑝 ! ! = 1 ) , we compute the cosine distances between all discipline pairs . Note that the distances between disciplines that were determined from references and citations are highly similar ( Pearson’s r = 0 . 978 , P < 0 . 001 ) , suggesting the robustness of this approach . Measuring interdisciplinarity ( Rao - Stirling diversity ) . While it is overall difficult to quantify all salient aspects of interdisciplinarity , research suggests that simply counting the number of disciplines that occur in references and citations is inadequate , as one must consider the relative proportion of each discipline and the distance between disciplines 20 , 29 . To this end , the Rao - Stirling Diversity has emerged as a common measure to quantify interdisciplinary research 20 , 26 , 29 , 32 , 41 . The Rao - Stirling index of a grant or a paper is defined as 𝑅𝑆 ( 𝑝 ) = 2 ∙ ∑ 𝑝 ! 𝑝 % 𝑑 ! % ! ) % , where p i ( p j ) is the probability that the underlying grant ( or paper ) is associated to discipline i ( j ) while d ij is the distance between discipline i and j . An RS score of 0 reflects a lack of interdisciplinarity ( i . e . , all references , citations , or grants are from the same discipline ) , whereas an RS score of 1 points to maximal interdisciplinarity .

Major publication databases assign each paper to certain scientific fields , while grant classifications are specific to individual funding agencies . a , We collect abstract and field labels of each publication in the Microsoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) database to build a semi - supervised topic model . b , Based on a large - scale representative sample of publications , we associate each word in an abstract with the field of study labels of the corresponding paper and vice versa using Labeled - Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( Labeled - LDA ) , allowing us to obtain a robust representation of word associations for each scientific field . c , Using our trained Labeled - LDA model , we estimate the posterior probabilities that a grant belongs to a given scientific field based on the word distribution in the corresponding grant abstract . d , We calculate the probabilities that a paper belongs to a scientific discipline based on the fields of referenced and citing publications , respectively . e , We estimate the distances between scientific fields using cosine similarity between the reference ( or citation ) vectors that we obtain from corresponding publications in each field . Note that the reference - and citation - based distances are highly correlated with each other ( Pearson’s r = 0 . 978 , P < 0 . 001 ) , suggesting that our result is insensitive to the measurement specification . f , Based on the probabilities computed in c , d and distances between fields computed in e , we calculate the level of interdisciplinarity of each grant and paper with the Rao – Stirling diversity measure .

Inset shows similar results when we consider paper interdisciplinarity based on citations . c , Papers with high interdisciplinary inspirations ( i . e . , reference - based paper interdisciplinarity ) have a higher chance to be hit papers ( dashed line as the baseline ) . This relationship also holds for grant - supported papers . The number of papers resulting from a grant ( d ) and the propensity to produce hit papers ( e ) systematically decrease as grant interdisciplinarity increases . 1985 1993 2001 2009 YHar 0 . 58 0 . 60 0 . 62 0 . 64 0 . 66 3 a S H r I n t H r G i s c i S li n a r i t y ( 5 H I H r H n c H ) a Grant 6uSSRrtHG All 0 20 40 60 80 100 Grant IntHrGisciSlinarity 0 . 57 0 . 60 0 . 63 0 . 66 0 . 69 3 a S H r I n t H r G i s c i S li n a r i t y ( 5 H I H r H n c H ) b 0 50 100 0 . 64 0 . 68 0 . 72 0 20 40 60 80 100 3aSHr IntHrGisciSlinarity ( 5HIHrHncH ) 0 . 02 0 . 05 0 . 08 0 . 11 0 . 14 H i t 5 a t H c Grant 6uSSRrtHG All 0 20 40 60 80 100 Grant IntHrGisciSlinarity 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 1 u P b H r R I 3 a S H r s d 0 20 40 60 80 100 Grant IntHrGisciSlinarity 0 . 11 0 . 12 0 . 13 0 . 14 0 . 15 H i t 5 a t H e 15 Fig . 3 | The impact of interdisciplinary papers as a function of grant interdisciplinarity . a , Interdisciplinary papers from more disciplinary grants tend to be associated with higher impact . b , While the baseline average of impacts increases with paper’s interdisciplinarity ( from Quintile 1 to Quintile 5 ) , interdisciplinarity grants have an overall reduced probability of producing impactful papers when controlling for papers with the same level of interdisciplinarity ( based on references ) . 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 GraQt IQtHrGiscipliQarity 100908070605040302010 3 a p H r I Q t H r G i s c i p li Q a r i t y ( 5 H I H r H Q c H ) a 0 . 10 0 . 12 0 . 14 0 . 16 0 . 18 H i t 5 a t H 0 20 40 60 80 100 GraQt IQtHrGiscipliQarity 0 . 06 0 . 09 0 . 12 0 . 15 0 . 18 H i t 5 a t H b 4uiQtilH 5 4uiQtilH 4 4uiQtilH 3 4uiQtilH 2 4uiQtilH 1 16 Fig . 4 | Disciplinary grants and high - impact interdisciplinary papers . a , Interdisciplinary grants tend to feature larger funding amounts . b , Considering only grants with large funding amounts ( top 10 % , Mean = 3 . 5M USD ) , we observe a sharp decline in both productivity ( purple ) and impact ( orange ) as a function of grant interdisciplinarity . c shows a similar pattern of diminishing returns when we focus on grants with median funding amounts ( middle 10 % , Mean = 744K USD ) . d , Interdisciplinary papers supported by disciplinary grants ( top left ) tend to have a similar or higher number of citations than baselines ( dashed lines ) both from inside and outside of their own fields . Other papers attract more citations than the random baseline either from their own field ( disciplinary papers supported by disciplinary grants ; bottom left ) , outside their own field ( interdisciplinary papers supported by interdisciplinary grants ; top right ) , or neither ( disciplinary papers supported by interdisciplinary grants ; bottom right ) . In e , we consider sets of the top and bottom 10 % interdisciplinary papers based on their references that were supported by multiple grants . We calculate the distance between grants and further divide the groups of publications into sets of highly ( dis ) similar pairs of ( inter ) disciplinary grants . We find that high - impact interdisciplinary papers tend to acknowledge the support of closely related disciplinary grants .

We used Labeled - LDA considering the following limitations of other methods : ( 1 ) a widely - used text classifier such as Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) 3 does not provide a word - to - category probability distribution , which is essential information for interpretability of the classification outcomes ; ( 2 ) since such a classifier associates each document with exactly one label , it is not optimal for multi - label classifications ; and ( 3 ) although a typical topic model like Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) 4 computes a word - to - category distribution , such a model is not ideal to assigning available classes because it is an unsupervised model . Since we aimed to build a model which learns word distributions with document - specific label distributions ( unlike SVM ) and incorporates supervision by constraining the topic model to use only those topics that correspond to a document’s observed label set ( unlike LDA ) , Labeled - LDA was an appropriate option . The resulting model constructs a one - to - one correspondence between latent topics and labels ( fields ) , from which a word - label ( i . e . , word - field ) distribution could be learned ( see Supplementary Table S1 for the top 10 words in each field by probability and FREX score 5 , a harmonic mean of relative frequency and exclusivity ) . We evaluated the quality of our Labeled - LDA model using both automated and human - centered approaches as described below : - Direct human ratings . We first estimated topic quality through direct ratings . To draw meaningful conclusions from human annotations , we required an adequate number of raters to ensure sufficient statistical power ( at least 1 − β = 0 . 9 ) . Following Hoyle et al . 6 , we had eighteen independent raters for each topic to obtain significance at α = 0 . 05 . We recruited 3 raters in the US with a graduate degree from Amazon Mechanical Turk and paid them 1 . 5 USD per survey , equivalent to roughly 18 USD / hour . We randomly selected 20 fields and pulled the top 10 words by each probability and FREX score , resulting in a total of 20 words for review . Each rater was provided ten field - word pairs , as shown in Supplementary Table S1 , and then asked to give the topic a quality score on a conventional three - point ordinal scale from 1 ( not very related ) to 3 ( very relevant ) 6 , 7 . The average quality score was 2 . 414 ± 0 . 245 and all scores were within the range of 1 . 722 to 2 . 778 , indicating that our topic model is highly reliable . - Out of sample prediction . We further examined multi - label classification performance using out - of - sample paper abstracts and corresponding field labels . In particular , we randomly sampled 5 , 000 papers as testing data , allowing us to obtain average precision of 0 . 461 while the precision of the random baseline was 0 . 006 . - Distance between predicted and ground truth labels . We trained the Labeled - LDA model to infer field - to - grant associations . In this particular application , the outcome of posterior inference can be considered acceptable even if the field with the highest probability does not match the ground truth . For example , the field with the highest probability of a grant is ‘Humanities’ while the ground truth is ‘Classics . ’ Even though the predicted label does not directly match the ground truth , the inference is sensical and aligns with human perception regarding field - field similarities since these two fields are conceptually highly similar . To test whether our model captures the perceived similarity / distance between fields properly , we finally computed the distance between the predicted and ground truth labels , using field - field similarities inferred by Labeled - LDA . In other words , we determined 4 pairwise topic similarity based on word probability distributions ( note that the Pearson correlation between pairwise distances of fields inferred by Labeled - LDA and citation patterns in Fig . 1e is 0 . 451 , P < 0 . 001 ) , where distance 0 represents a perfect match while 1 means that the predicted field is conceptually the most distant field to the ground truth . Investigating the distribution of the distance between predicted and ground truth fields , we observed that the mean distance was 0 . 311 , which is significantly smaller than the random baseline of 0 . 606 ( P < 0 . 001 ) . In sum , these validations ensure that the topic representation reasonably captures the nuances of each field and infers the field - grant associations . Supplementary Note 2 : Multivariate Analysis We additionally examined the robustness of the relationships between the paper’s impact and grant and paper interdisciplinarities using Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) regressions . Supplementary Table S2 reports the results of regression analyses of paper impact , operationalized as normalized 10 - year citations ( year and field controlled ) . The interdisciplinarity model ( Model 1 ) consists of interdisciplinary inspirations of a paper , mean interdisciplinarity of supporting grants , and mean grant - grant field similarity . The non - interdisciplinarity model ( Model 2 ) includes the number of supporting grants , institutes , and funding countries along with the total funding amounts in USD as grant - specific conditions as well as the number of authors as author - related conditions . We excluded other grant - and author - related variables such as the number of grant investigators and institutes involved in the paper due to multicollinearity . The combined model ( Model 3 ) reports the effects of grant and paper interdisciplinarities net of non - interdisciplinary conditions . Note that we log - transformed the normalized 10 - year citations , the total funding amounts , and the number of 5 supporting grants , institutes , funding countries , and authors to correct for the skewed distribution . As shown in Supplementary Table S2 , interdisciplinarity measures indeed make an additive contribution to the full models’ explanatory power ( 0 . 060 in Model 3 ) as these measures improve the adjusted R 2 of Model 2 ( 0 . 052 ) as much as the adjusted R 2 of Model 1 ( 0 . 008 ) without significant changes in coefficients . Consistent with our main observations , the level of interdisciplinary inspiration of the paper , the number of supporting grants , and the total funding amounts all exhibit positive impacts on the success of the paper ( P < 0 . 001 for all of these variables ) . Furthermore , the mean interdisciplinarity of grants has a negative impact on the paper’s success ( P < 0 . 001 ) , indicating that papers from more disciplinary research programs are more likely to be successful . The average similarity between supporting grants shows a positive relationship with the paper’s success ( P < 0 . 001 ) , indicating that papers are more successful if supported by more closely related grants instead of highly diverse ones , clearly confirming our main results . Finally , as reported in previous research 8 , the number of authors and the number of grant - supporting institutes and funding countries all show significant positive coefficients as well ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Supplementary Note 3 : Robustness of the Results To confirm the robustness of our results based on the entire grant and publication data from 1985 to 2009 , we replicated our key analyses in Figs . 2b , d , Fig . 3a , and Figs . 4a , d considering different funding agencies ( NIH and NSF ; see Supplementary Fig . S5 ) , time windows ( before and after 2000 ; see Supplementary Fig . S6 ) , and countries ( US and China among others ; see Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . These results are almost identical to the observations we report in the main text based on the entire data . 6 Supplementary References 1 . Ramage , D . , Hall , D . , Nallapati , R . & Manning , C .

We obtained similar results as shown in Fig . 2a when we considered the interdisciplinarity of papers through their received citations as a proxy of a publication’s broad appeal . In turn , we observed a recent decline in the interdisciplinarity of citations that papers garnered that appeared to be roughly independent of grant support . Such an observation may be rooted in the fact that cross - discipline citations tend to emphasize older papers , suggesting that papers need time to accumulate more interdisciplinary citations 9 . 1985 1993 2001 2009 Year 0 . 58 0 . 62 0 . 66 0 . 70 3 a S e r I n t e r G i s c i S li n a r i t y ( C i t a t i o n ) Grant 6uSSorteG 1o Grant 6uSSort All 8 Supplementary Fig .

Sorting publications according to their interdisciplinarity based on their references , we found that interdisciplinary grants tend to produce an increasing fraction of highly interdisciplinary papers ( blue ) that we define as the top 10 % of most interdisciplinary papers .

By measuring the hit rate of papers ( probability of being in the top 5 % per field and year in terms of the number of citations ) as a function of interdisciplinary appeal ( i . e . , citation - based paper interdisciplinarity ) , we found that more interdisciplinary papers have a higher impact .
