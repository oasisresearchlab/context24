Development and Cross - Cultural Application of a Speciﬁc Instrument to Measure EntrepreneurialIntentions Francisco Liñán Yi - Wen Chen This article uses Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior to build an entrepreneurial intention questionnaire ( EIQ ) and analyzes its psychometric properties . The entrepreneurial intention model is then tested on a 519 - individual sample from two rather diverse countries : Spain and Taiwan . EIQ and structural equation techniques have been used to try to overcome previous research limitations . The role of culture in explaining motivational perceptions has been speciﬁcally considered . Results indicate EIQ properties are satisfactory and strong support for the model is found . Relevant insights are derived about how cultural values modify the way individuals in each society perceive entrepreneurship . Introduction There is a growing body of literature arguing that intentions play a very relevant role in the decision to start a new ﬁrm . The importance of cognitive variables in understanding this personal decision has been highlighted by Baron ( 2004 ) and Shaver and Scott ( 1991 ) , among other researchers . In their view , this cognitive focus provides additional insights into the complex process of entrepreneurship . “Given the impressive success of a cogni - tive approach in other ﬁelds ( e . g . , psychology , education ) , there are grounds for predicting that it may also yield positive results when applied to the ﬁeld of entrepreneurship” ( Baron , p . 237 ) . This study follows the cognitive approach through the application of an entrepre - neurial intention model . A number of works have been published lately about this issue . However , a lot of research is still needed to better comprehend what the factors affecting entrepreneurial perceptions are . In particular , our knowledge is specially limited in two speciﬁc areas . First , cross - cultural studies are needed for the effect Please send correspondence to : Francisco Liñán , tel . : + 34 . 954554487 ; e - mail : ﬂinan @ us . es , and to Yi - Wen Chen at g1359508 @ nccu . edu . tw .

Nevertheless , for different research to be comparable , measurement instruments have to be standardized . Therefore , there is also a need to develop more adequate reliable and valid instruments to analyze entrepreneurial perceptions and intentions . The main purpose of this article is clearly in line with these needs . The present study is divided into two parts . First , the construction and psychometric properties of a newly developed instrument—the entrepreneurial intention questionnaire ( EIQ ) —will be described . Reliability and validity analyses will be performed to assess the adequacy of this instrument . Second , the applicability of the entrepreneurial intention model to differ - ent cultural settings will also be tested . Empirical analyses of entrepreneurial intentions are increasingly common ( Autio , Keeley , Klofsten , Parker , & Hay , 2001 ; Chen , Greene , & Crick , 1998 ; Erikson , 1999 ; Fayolle , Gailly , & Lassas - Clerc , 2006 ; Kickul & Zaper , 2000 ; Kolvereid , 1996b ; Kolv - ereid & Isaksen , 2006 ; Krueger , 1993 ; Krueger & Brazeal , 1994 ; Krueger , Reilly , & Carsrud , 2000 ; Lee & Wong , 2004 ; Peterman & Kennedy , 2003 ; Reitan , 1998 ; Tkachev & Kolvereid , 1999 ; Veciana , Aponte , & Urbano , 2005 ; Zhao , Hills , & Siebert , 2005 ) . Most of them have developed their own ad hoc research instruments ( Chandler & Lyon , 2001 ) . Comparisons between these works become quite problematic since differences among construct measures are sometimes substantial . Therefore , this article undertakes the task of building a measure that may be statistically robust and theoreti - cally sound . This instrument will then be used on samples from two quite different countries ( Spain and Taiwan ) . Data thus obtained will be used to test the entrepreneurial intention model using structural equation techniques , following Ajzen’s ( 1991 ) formulation of the theory of planned behavior ( TPB ) . This implies the existence of structural relationships . In the past , most research on entrepreneurial intentions has used linear regression models ( Chandler & Lyon , 2001 ) despite the risk of biased results . Regarding the pattern of relationships in the model , one important concern is the traditionally weak role of subjective norm ( SN ) in the TPB . In the area of entrepreneur - ship , however , this alleged weakness is not so clear . Nevertheless , some studies have simply omitted SN ( Peterman & Kennedy , 2003 ; Veciana et al . , 2005 ) , while others found it to be nonsigniﬁcant ( Autio et al . , 2001 ; Krueger et al . , 2000 ) . The existence of inter - actions and indirect effects of SN on intention could be explaining these results . Thus , in this article , structural equations are used so that a clearer understanding of those effects may be gained . This study will hopefully shed some light on a number of issues . It will serve as a conﬁrmation of the applicability of this cognitive model to the entrepreneurial decision . In this case , our sample comes from two countries with very different cultural and social structures . Thus , the robustness of this model in different settings will be tested . It will also contribute to clarifying the speciﬁc pattern of relationships among the inten - tion antecedents . In addition , some of the effects of culture over entrepreneurial inten - tions will be tested . Finally , relevant implications for educators and policy makers could be derived . In this sense , these two countries are clearly different in history and culture . None - theless , they are both sizeable economies , whether we consider their population ( 42 . 7 million in Spain and 22 . 7 in Taiwan , according to IMF data for 2004 [ IMF , 2008 ] ) or total GDP ( U . S . $ 1 , 045 . 7 and U . S . $ 331 . 1 billion , respectively ) . They are both con - sidered high - income countries ( U . S . $ 24 , 493 and U . S . $ 14 , 594 per capita ) . In addition , according to the GEM report ( Reynolds , Bygrave , Autio , & Hay , 2002 ) , similar levels of 594 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE entrepreneurial activity 1 are found in both of them ( around 4 . 6 % ) . These data suggest Spain and Taiwan , despite their large differences , are not completely dissimilar , which would render the comparison more fruitful . The organization of the article is as follows . The second section reviews previous contributions and presents the theoretical entrepreneurial intention model adopted , together with the hypotheses to be tested . The third section describes how the question - naire was developed and its psychometric properties . The fourth section presents the results for the cross - country study using a structural equations model . Finally , a discussion is included in the ﬁfth section . The article ends with a brief conclusion . Theory and Hypotheses The decision to become an entrepreneur may be plausibly considered as voluntary and conscious ( Krueger et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , it seems reasonable to analyze how that decision is made . Entrepreneurship may be viewed as a process that occurs over time ( Gartner , Shaver , Gatewood , & Katz , 1994 ; Kyrö & Carrier , 2005 ) . In this sense , entre - preneurial intentions would be the ﬁrst step in the evolving and—sometimes—long process of venture creation ( Lee & Wong , 2004 ) . The intention to start up , then , would be a necessary precursor to performing entrepreneurial behaviors ( Fayolle et al . , 2006 ; Kolvereid , 1996b ) . Intention is considered the single best predictor of behavior ( Ajzen , 1991 , 2001 ; Fishbein & Ajzen , 1975 ) . In turn , the intention of carrying out entrepreneurial behaviors may be affected by several factors , such as needs , values , wants , habits , and beliefs ( Bird , 1988 ; Lee & Wong , 2004 ) . In particular , the cognitive variables inﬂuencing intention are called motivational “antecedents” by Ajzen ( 1991 ) . More favorable antecedents would increase the start - up intention ( Liñán , 2004 ) . Obviously , situational factors also inﬂuence entrepreneurial intentions ( Ajzen , 1987 ; Boyd & Vozikis , 1994 ; Tubbs & Ekeberg , 1991 ) . These external factors inﬂuence one’s attitudes toward entrepreneurship ( Krueger , 1993 ) . Variables such as time constraints , task difﬁculty , and the inﬂuence of other people through social pressure could be examples of these situational factors ( Lee & Wong ) . Results have supported the applicability of the TPB to entrepreneurship , despite some conﬂicts between the various studies . A good part of these differences may have been due to measurement issues ( Chandler & Lyon , 2001 ) . In fact , measuring cognitive variables implies considerable difﬁculty ( Baron , 1998 ) . Thus , empirical tests have differed widely . Krueger et al . ( 2000 ) used single - item variables to measure each construct . Kolvereid ( 1996b ) used a belief - based measure of attitudes . More recently , Kolvereid and Isaksen ( 2006 ) have used an aggregate measure for attitudes , but a single - item one for intention . Similarly , some of these studies used an unconditional measure of intention ( Autio et al . , 2001 ; Kickul & Zaper , 2000 ; Kolvereid & Isaksen ; Krueger et al . ; Zhao et al . , 2005 ) , while others forced participants to state their preferences and estimated likelihoods of pursuing a self - employment career “as opposed to organizational employment” ( Erikson , 1999 ; Fayolle et al . , 2006 ; Kolvereid ) . Therefore , there is work to be done to produce a standard measurement instrument for entrepreneurial intention and its antecedents . In this sense , this article develops an EIQ , based on an integration of psychology and 1 . Data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor . In 2002 , the term “Total Entrepreneurial Activity” was used , which corresponds to “Early - Stage Entrepreneurial Activity” at present . That is , nascent entrepreneurs and owners of young businesses ( up to 42 months of existence ) . 595 May , 2009 entrepreneurship literature , as well as previous empirical research in this ﬁeld . The EIQ tries to overcome the main shortcomings of previous research instruments . According to the TPB , entrepreneurial intention indicates the effort that the person will make to carry out that entrepreneurial behavior . And so , it captures the three moti - vational factors , or antecedents , inﬂuencing behavior ( Ajzen , 1991 ; Liñán , 2004 ) : • Attitude toward start - up ( personal attitude , PA ) refers to the degree to which the individual holds a positive or negative personal valuation about being an entrepreneur ( Ajzen , 2001 ; Autio et al . , 2001 ; Kolvereid , 1996b ) . It includes not only affective ( I like it , it is attractive ) , but also evaluative considerations ( it has advantages ) . • Subjective norm ( SN ) measures the perceived social pressure to carry out—or not to carry out—entrepreneurial behaviors . In particular , it would refer to the perception that “reference people” would approve of the decision to become an entrepreneur , or not ( Ajzen , 2001 ) . • Perceived behavioral control ( PBC ) is deﬁned as the perception of the ease or difﬁculty of becoming an entrepreneur . It is , therefore , a concept quite similar to self - efﬁcacy ( SE ) ( Bandura , 1997 ) , and to perceived feasibility ( Shapero & Sokol , 1982 ) . All three concepts refer to the sense of capacity regarding the fulﬁllment of ﬁrm - creation behaviors . Nevertheless , recent work has emphasized the difference between PBC and SE ( Ajzen , 2002 ) . PBC would include not only the feeling of being able , but also the perception about controllability of the behavior . The relative contributions of these three motivational factors to explaining entrepreneurial intention are not established beforehand . The speciﬁc conﬁguration of relationships between those constructs would have to be empirically determined for each speciﬁc behavior ( Ajzen , 1991 , 2002 ) . In the speciﬁc area of entrepreneurship research , only 7 out of the 16 studies previ - ously reported included SNs in the analysis . However , two of them did not perform any regression analysis . Of the remaining ﬁve studies , three found SN to signiﬁcantly explain EI ( Kolvereid , 1996b ; Kolvereid & Isaksen , 2006 ; Tkachev & Kolvereid , 1999 ) , whereas the other two found SN to be nonsigniﬁcant ( Autio et al . , 2001 ; Krueger et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , although there is support for the idea that a direct SN – EI relationship might be established , some controversy remains . In this sense , the possibility of indirect effects of SN on EI should be investigated further . In this sense , there may be reasons to consider that SN has an effect on both PA and PBC . From a social - capital point of view , a number of authors argue that values trans - mitted by “reference people” would cause more favorable perceptions regarding PA and PBC ( Cooper , 1993 ; Matthews & Moser , 1995 ; Scherer , Brodzinsky , & Wiebe , 1991 ) . Liñán and Santos ( 2007 ) describe SN as a speciﬁc form of social capital and suggest a causation effect over the other two intention antecedents . Figure 1 reﬂects this idea . On the other hand , as mentioned previously , human capital and other demographic factors have an inﬂuence on intentions ( Boyd & Vozikis , 1994 ; Lee & Wong , 2004 ; Tubbs & Ekeberg , 1991 ) . In particular , a greater knowledge of different entrepreneurial aspects will surely contribute to more realistic perceptions about entrepreneurial activity ( Ajzen , 2002 ) , thus indirectly inﬂuencing intentions . The relevance of experience and education has been widely highlighted , especially for the increased knowledge it provides ( Cooper , 1985 , 1993 ) . In general , greater knowledge will also directly provide a greater awareness about the existence of that professional career option ( Liñán , 2004 ) , as may be inferred by the importance attached to the existence of role models ( Carrier , 2005 ; Matthews & Moser , 1995 ; Rondstadt , 1990 ) . This latter element would have an inﬂuence on PBC and possibly on PA and SN as well 596 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE ( Scherer et al . , 1991 ) . Therefore , it might be expected that the different circumstances modifying the level of entrepreneurial knowledge would have distinct and signiﬁcant effects on the motivational intention antecedents . Figure 1 , therefore , summarizes the model we will be using as a starting point for our analysis . Apart from the explicit inclusion of demographic and human capital variables , Figure 1 is equivalent to the TPB described by Ajzen ( 1991 ) , and used by Autio et al . ( 2001 ) , Erikson ( 1999 ) , Fayolle et al . ( 2006 ) , Kolvereid ( 1996b ) , Kolvereid and Isaksen ( 2006 ) , Krueger et al . ( 2000 ) , Reitan ( 1998 ) , and Veciana et al . ( 2005 ) , among others . One particularity , however , is that we have speciﬁcally hypothesized what the pattern of relationships among the motivational antecedents of intention is . SN is assumed to inﬂuence both PA and PBC . Cultural Considerations The application of this model to different cultures has been scarce . Autio et al . ( 2001 ) is one of the few examples . Culture has been deﬁned as the underlying system of values peculiar to a speciﬁc group or society ( Mueller & Thomas , 2001 ) . Thus , culture motivates individuals in a society to engage in behaviors that may not be evident in other societies . A number of authors ( Busenitz , Gómez , & Spencer , 2000 ; George & Zahra , 2002 ; Mueller , Thomas , & Jaeger , 2002 ) see culture as a moderator between economic and institutional conditions , on one side , and entrepreneurship , on the other . Most research about the inﬂuence of culture on entrepreneurship has followed Hofstede’s ( 1980 ) cultural dimensions ( Hayton , George , & Zahra , 2002 ; Mcgrath & MacMillan , 1992 ; Mitchell , Smith , Seawright , & Morse , 2000 ; Mueller & Thomas , 2001 ; Mueller et al . , 2002 ; Shane , Kolvereid , & Westhead , 1991 ) . However , Hofstede et al . ( 2004 ) consider two alternative forms in which this inﬂuence may be exercised . A positive aggregate effect would take place when culture shapes economic and social institutions , making them more favorable toward entrepreneurial activity . Thus , “integrated” individu - als may ﬁnd it easier to become entrepreneurs . Where culture is relatively unfavorable toward entrepreneurship , “dissatisﬁed” individuals would seek personal realization through self - employment . Mcgrath , MacMillan , and Scheinberg ( 1992 ) argue that entrepreneurs would tend to exhibit certain levels of those dimensions : high power - distance ( PDI + ) , low uncertainty - Figure 1 Entrepreneurial Intention Model Human capital and other demographic variables Perceived Behavioral Control Personal Attitude Subjective Norm Entrepreneurial Intention 597 May , 2009 avoidance ( UAV – ) , high individualism ( IND + ) , and high masculinity ( MAS + ) . In par - ticular , they consider PDI + as a personal characteristic of entrepreneurs “regardless of whether the culture is high or low on power - distance” ( Mcgrath et al . , p . 119 ) . Busenitz and Lau ( 1996 ) transfer these assumptions to the national level , suggesting that cultures high on those values would favor the entrepreneurial activity of its members . Mueller et al . ( 2002 ) share this view , except for the PDI index . They argue that low power distance ( PDI – ) cultures would favor entrepreneurship . This view is called by Hofstede et al . ( 2004 ) the “aggregate psychological traits” perspective and would favor start - up of “integrated” individuals . However , they argue that “dissatisﬁed” individuals would tend to become self - employed when the national culture is relatively unfavorable to entrepreneurship . Thus , opposite relationships might be estab - lished ( PDI + , UAV + , IND – , and MAS – national cultural dimensions would be associated with higher self - employment levels ) . As Hayton et al . ( 2002 ) and Busenitz et al . ( 2000 ) point out , cultural dimensions would moderate the relationship between economic situation and entrepreneurial activity . Thus , the relative presence of integrated and dissatisﬁed entrepreneurs in any given culture may change substantially depending on its economic situation . In this sense , support found by Hofstede et al . ( 2004 ) for the “dissatisfaction” theory might partly be due to their measure of entrepreneurship . They used self - employment as the dependent variable , which is quite different from entrepreneurial activity ( Uhlaner & Thurik , 2007 ) . It would include new and established business owners , but it would not yet include nascent and intentional entrepreneurs . It might be expected that new start - up attempts would corre - spond more closely to “integrated” entrepreneurial efforts , while “dissatisﬁed” business owners would remain self - employed for a long period ( Uhlaner & Thurik ) . Thus , a culture unfavorable to entrepreneurship might lead to a higher proportion of self - employed individuals and , therefore , to smaller average ﬁrm size . However , this would be compatible with lower entrepreneurial activity ( start - ups attempted ) . On the other hand , it may be argued that a supportive culture would lead to higher entrepreneurial intentions among the population and , therefore , more new ventures being attempted . Values shared within a culture , according to the TPB approach , would affect the motivational intention antecedents . In this sense , a supportive culture would help in the legitimation of entrepreneurship ( Etzioni , 1987 ) . As SN reﬂects the perceived social pressure to start a ﬁrm , the inﬂuence of cultural values might be stronger on this motiva - tional antecedent ( Ajzen , 2001 ; Begley & Tan , 2001 ; Kristiansen & Indarti , 2004 ) argue that SN tends to play a stronger role in explaining intention in collectivist cultures , and weaker in individualistic societies . In this study , two quite different countries are considered . Nevertheless , Hoftede’s cultural dimensions are relatively similar in both of them . Thus , power - distance ( 57 for Spain and 58 for Taiwan ) and masculinity ( 42 and 45 , respectively ) scores are broadly equivalent ( Hofstede , 2003 ) . However , Spain scores substantially higher in individualism ( 51 vs . 17 for Taiwan ) , which would imply a culture more supportive of entrepreneurship . On the other hand , Spain also scores higher on uncertainty avoidance ( 86 vs . 69 ) . It could be considered that in this dimension , Spanish culture is relatively more opposed to entrepreneurship . The economic situation has been positive in both countries since the mid - 1990s ( 2002 being the only exception ) . Economic growth has tended to be somewhat higher in Taiwan , whereas unemployment level has been lower . Spain’s unemployment , although still higher , has been decreasing substantially since the mid - 1990s . Therefore , the inﬂu - ence of the economic situation might be considered as neutral for the purposes of this study . 598 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE No speciﬁc research comparing the effects of cultural differences on entrepreneurial intentions for these two countries has been found . However , Mcgrath , MacMillan , Yang , and Tsai ( 1992 ) compared cultural values of entrepreneurs from Taiwan and the United States ( and also China ) . Uslay , Teach , and Schwartz ( 2002 ) —although not using Hoft - ede’s dimensions—compared entrepreneurial attitudes of Spanish and U . S . MBA students ( and also Turkish ) . Based on this literature , some tentative predictions may be formulated . First , Taiwan is much less individualistic than Spain , being among the more collectivistic countries in the world , and this seems to be an enduring characteristic ( Mcgrath et al . , 1992 ) . Thus , one should expect that SN would exert a much higher effect over PA , PBC , and EI than in Spain ( Begley & Tan , 2001 ) . Second , Uslay et al . ( 2002 ) found that Spanish students agreed signiﬁcantly more than their U . S . counterparts with the statement “entrepreneurship offers job satisfaction . ” On the other hand , Taiwanese entrepreneurs disagree signiﬁcantly more with the statement “starting a company adds to the excitement of your life . ” This would be indicating that “salient beliefs” conforming the motivational intention antecedents are different in each culture ( Ajzen , 1991 ; Kolvereid , 1996a ) . In this sense , entrepreneurial intention could be more closely linked to PA among Spanish respondents , whereas in Taiwan PBC would be a relatively stronger inﬂuence . Regarding the effect of higher uncertainty avoidance in Spain , entrepreneurship would be considered a more uncertain career option and , therefore , socially discouraged ( Busenitz & Lau , 1996 ; Mueller et al . , 2002 ) . The effect over motivational antecedents , however , is far from clear . High UAV would lead people to feel “threatened by uncertain or unknown situations” ( Hofstede , 1991 , p . 113 ) . Thus , they might feel less able to start a ﬁrm , even if they had all the technical and practical knowledge . In this sense , the effect of PBC over EI would be lower . Hypotheses The hypotheses to be tested are summarized in Table 1 . As may be seen , hypotheses 1 to 3 correspond to the traditional intention model used elsewhere . Hypotheses 4 and 5 would explain the internal conﬁguration of antecedents . To test these two hypotheses , structural equation systems are required . Table 1 Hypotheses No . Description 1 Personal attitude positively inﬂuences entrepreneurial intention PA → EI 2 Perceived behavioral control positively inﬂuences entrepreneurial intention PBC → EI 3 Subjective norm positively inﬂuences entrepreneurial intention SN → EI 4 Subjective norm positively inﬂuences personal attitude SN → PA 5 Subjective norm positively inﬂuences perceived behavioral control SN → PBC 6 Subjective norm exerts a stronger effect on PA and PBC in the less individualistic country ( Taiwan ) Tw → SN + 7 The relative effect of PA and PBC on EI differs by country Sp → PA + ( PA effect on EI stronger in Spain , PBC effect stronger in Taiwan ) Tw → PBC + 599 May , 2009 Finally , two hypotheses relating to culture have also been derived . The higher collec - tivist character ( IND – ) of Taiwan suggests that SN would exert a stronger effect over the other motivational antecedents and also over EI ( hypothesis 6 ) . On the other hand , speciﬁc salient beliefs associated with entrepreneurship would be different in Spain and Taiwan . Similarly , higher UAV in Spain might downplay the role of PBC in the formation of entrepreneurial intentions . These two still tentative arguments , taken together , lead us to formulate hypothesis 7 . Instrument Development and Psychometric Properties In this article , the entrepreneurial intention model is considered as essentially adequate to analyze the intention of becoming an entrepreneur . Therefore , an instrument to measure intentions and the other variables in the model was needed . The EIQ was developed for that purpose . It is based on the existing theoretical and empirical literature about the application of the TPB to entrepreneurship . Thus , it has been carefully cross - checked with those instruments used by other researchers , such as Autio et al . ( 2001 ) , Chen et al . ( 1998 ) , Kickul and Zaper ( 2000 ) , Kolvereid ( 1996b ) , Kolvereid and Isaksen ( 2006 ) , Krueger et al . ( 2000 ) , and Veciana et al . ( 2005 ) . Throughout the whole construc - tion process , Ajzen’s ( 1991 , 2001 , 2002 ) work has been carefully revised to solve any discrepancy that might have arisen between the different instruments . The EIQ is available from the authors upon request . Items used to capture the central elements of the entre - preneurial intention model are included in the Appendix . The EIQ has been divided into 10 sections . Sections 3 to 6 correspond with the elements in the entrepreneurial intention model ( see Figure 1 ) . Within them , all constructs are Likert - type scales . In this sense , Nunnally ( 1978 ) suggests that multi - item scales are more reliable than single - item ones . The ﬁrst ( education and experience ) , second ( entrepreneurial knowledge ) , and ninth ( personal data ) sections require human capital and demographic information that should not affect intention directly , but could be very useful in identifying their effect on PA , SN , and PBC . Finally , we also asked students to voluntarily provide contact data so that they may be studied again later . This follow - up will hopefully allow for future analysis of the intention – behavior relationship . In this sense , a section centered on entrepreneurial objec - tives has also been included . Its purpose is to analyze students’ concept of “success” and the importance they attach to business development and growth . Entrepreneurial quality has been deﬁned as the behaviors performed to develop the ﬁrm and make it dynamic ( Guzman & Santos , 2001 ; Santos & Liñán , 2007 ) . Measures Entrepreneurial intention has been measured through a Likert - type scale with ﬁve items . These are general sentences indicating different aspects of intention . A similar system has already been used by Chen et al . ( 1998 ) and Zhao et al . ( 2005 ) . However , Armitage and Conner ( 2001 ) identiﬁed three distinct kinds of intention measures : desire ( “I want to . . . ” ) , self - prediction ( “How likely it is . . . ” ) and behavioral intention ( “I intend to . . . ” ) . This latter type seems to provide slightly better results in the prediction of behavior ( Armitage & Conner , 2001 , p . 483 ) . In this sense , Chen et al . use a mix of self - prediction and pure - intention items , whereas Zhao et al . use “interest” measures 600 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE ( “How interested are you in . . . ” ? ) . In our opinion , the similarity between interest and intention may not be so clear . For this reason we have chosen a pure - intention measure . PA has also been measured through an aggregate attitude scale . This is an important difference compared to other studies , such as those of Kolvereid ( 1996b ) and Fayolle et al . ( 2006 ) , where a belief - based measure of PA was used . However , Ajzen ( 1991 , 2001 ) states that beliefs are the antecedents of attitudes and suggests using an aggregate measure for attitudes ( beliefs would explain attitude , while attitude would explain intention ) . In this sense , Krueger et al . ( 2000 ) use such a design , with beliefs explaining an aggregate measure of attitude , while this latter variable was used to explain intention . Similarly , in Kolvereid and Isaksen’s ( 2006 ) study , both kinds of measures were included together in a linear regression with entrepreneurial intention as the dependent variable . Aggregate attitude was a signiﬁcant regressor , while beliefs were not . Correlations between the aggregate and belief - based measures are sometimes disappointing ( Ajzen , 1991 , p . 192 ) . For this reason , we have chosen an aggregate measure of PA in the EIQ . PA toward entrepreneurship has sometimes been measured unconditionally ( Krueger et al . , 2000 ) , while in some other instances it has been considered as opposed to salaried work ( Kolvereid , 1996b ) . This opposition is far from clear . It has been argued that “this dichotomization is clearly a simpliﬁcation . [ . . . ] It is not clear how to categorize people who combine working for an employer and running their own business . There is evidence to suggest that a large proportion of new business founders start their business as a part - time operation while they continue to work for their employer ( Carter , Gartner , & Reynolds , 1996 ; Delmar & Davidsson , 2000 ) ” ( Kolvereid & Isaksen , 2006 , p . 870 ) . In this sense , we have included an additional question in the EIQ to test the extent to which these two concepts may be considered as truly opposed . Thus , following Autio et al . ( 2001 ) , respondents were asked to rate their preference toward both options as different items . Analyzing the correlation between the answers to these two items could serve to check the validity of this assumption . SN , according to Ajzen ( 1991 ) , should be approached through an aggregate measure of the kind “what do reference people think ? ” In practice , however , some researchers simply omit this element from the model ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Krueger , 1993 ) . On the other hand , others have posited answers to this question with their respective “motives to comply” ( Kolvereid , 1996b ; Kolvereid & Isaksen , 2006 ; Tkachev & Kolvereid , 1999 ) . Nevertheless , Armitage and Conner ( 2001 , p . 485 ) found that , in general , the “subjective norm ¥ motives to comply” measure tends to show weaker predictive power toward intention than the “multiple - item subjective norm” measure . This alleged weakness may not be so clear in the speciﬁc area of entrepreneurship research . Nonetheless , we have used one simpler scale in the validation process , including three groups of “reference people : family , friends and colleagues . ” In this manner , we also contribute to keep the EIQ as parsimonious as possible . In previous research , PBC has been measured through speciﬁc self - efﬁcacies ( Chen et al . , 1998 ; Zhao et al . , 2005 ) . More general measures of SE and perceived controllability of behavior have also been used . In particular , Kolvereid ( 1996b ) used a general 6 - item scale with good results , whereas Kolvereid and Isaksen ( 2006 ) used an 18 - item scale that was then grouped into four speciﬁc self - efﬁcacies through factor analysis . This latter study showed no signiﬁcant correlation between PBC and intention . In Ajzen’s ( 1991 ) opinion , control beliefs would be the antecedents of an aggregate measure of PBC . Thus , speciﬁc efﬁcacies and control beliefs could be understood as being the antecedent of general PBC . In this sense , as aggregate measures have been used for PA and SN , we chose to keep this scheme for PBC as well . 601 May , 2009 Therefore , respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with several general statements about the feeling of capacity regarding ﬁrm creation . In a recent work , Ajzen ( 2002 ) considers that PBC is a concept somewhat wider than SE . It would also include a measure of controllability ( the extent to which successfully performing the behavior is up to the person ) . Nevertheless , Kolvereid and Isaksen ( 2006 ) used a pure “self - efﬁcacy” scale because Armitage and Conner ( 2001 ) concluded that SE is more clearly deﬁned and more strongly correlated with intention and behavior . The EIQ includes a 6 - item scale ; ﬁve of these items measure general SE , whereas one is a controllability statement ( 15c , see Appendix ) . Psychometric Properties To analyze the psychometric properties of the EIQ , a sample of last - year university students was used . Samples of students are very common in the entrepreneurship literature ( Autio et al . , 2001 ; Fayolle et al . , 2006 ; Kolvereid , 1996b ; Krueger et al . , 2000 ; Tkachev & Kolvereid , 1999 ; Veciana et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , recent research has found that university graduates between 25 and 34 years of age show the highest propensity toward starting up a ﬁrm ( Reynolds et al . , 2002 ) . Last - year students would be , therefore , very close to entering this segment of the population . Questionnaires were administered in class , with prior permission from the lecturer . Students were briefed on the purpose of the study by a member of the research team , and then asked to voluntarily ﬁll in the EIQ . Questionnaires were in principle anonymous , but contact data were asked for if they freely wanted to participate in the project follow - up . Fieldwork was carried out in October and November 2004 at University of Seville ( Spain ) . A total of 323 questionnaires were thus collected . Thirteen of them were removed due to a high level of missing data , or to respondents being visiting students from abroad . For the remaining 310 , missing data were always less than 2 % of responses and were thus retained . Business students were 66 . 7 % of the sample ( the rest being students of econom - ics ) . Of the sample , 53 . 5 % were female , and the average age was 23 . 8 years . These ﬁgures roughly correspond to the general characteristics of students in these degrees . Thus , it may be considered a representative sample . Chandler and Lyon ( 2001 , p . 103 ) consider reliability ( “consistency and stability of a score from a measurement scale” ) and validity ( “evidence that the measurement is actu - ally measuring the intended construct” ) as the essential psychometrics to be reported . The ﬁrst step was using Cronbach’s alpha to test reliability of the proposed scales . The usual threshold level is . 7 for newly developed measures ( Nunnally , 1978 ) . In this case , the values range from . 773 to . 943 ( see last row in Table 2 ) . Thus , the theoretically developed scales may be considered as reliable . The second step was validity analysis . Chandler and Lyon ( 2001 ) establish several possible validation procedures . Structural and content validities have been carefully considered when developing the instrument . All items are carefully matched to the theoretical construction of the model . Much care has been taken to ensure that items are both relevant and representative of the construct being measured ( Messick , 1988 ) . Substantive validity , on the other hand , refers to the convergent and discriminant characteristics of the construct . Convergent validity is usually assessed using factor analysis ( Klein , Astrachan , & Smyrnios , 2005 ; Kreiser , Marino , & Weaver , 2002 ; Moriano , Palací , & Morales , 2006 ) . In our sample , the Kaiser – Meyer – Olkin test for sample adequacy was notably high ( . 912 ) and Bartlett’s sphericity test highly signiﬁcant ( p < . 001 ) . Both statistics suggest that data 602 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE are suitable for factor analysis . A Kolmogorov – Smirnov test was performed to check for normality in the items’ distribution . Since normality was not supported , the extraction method selected was principal axis factorization . Three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 emerged , whereas the fourth eigenvalue was . 998 . Therefore , the scree plot was considered , which suggested a 4 - factor solution . Cumulative variance explained by the extraction was 72 . 2 % . Table 2 presents the rotated factor matrix . As may be observed , all items loaded on the expected factor only . Discriminant validity may be assessed looking at correlations . Items should correlate more strongly with their own construct than with any other , indicating that they are perceived by respondents as belonging to their theoretical construct ( Messick , 1988 ) . In this sense , in Table 3 , the average item - construct correlation has been computed for each construct . As may be observed , correlations of each item to other constructs are always below the average correlation with their own construct . Obviously , these psychometric properties should be tested again on different samples . Nevertheless , initial results suggest the EIQ might fulﬁll reliability and validity require - ments . Therefore , we will use it in the second part of our study .

The cross - cultural applicability of the entrepreneurial intention model and the speciﬁc role of cultural values will be analyzed . An enlarged Spanish sample was used together with a Taiwanese one . Sample Characteristics For the Spanish sample , another two universities were included ( Pablo Olavide and Jaen universities ) , to be added to the 310 original usable questionnaires from Seville . Data collection procedure was similar . In this manner , we collected another 77 questionnaires ( November 2004 ) . All of them had less than 2 % of missing data , and no foreigners or visiting students ﬁlled them in , so they were all usable . Separate analyses were performed on the initial sample and the new one . In this latter sample , there were more women ( 64 . 9 % ) and all respondents were business students ( economics is not on offer at these two universities ) . Finally , of the 387 total respondents , 71 . 9 % of them are business students , the rest being essentially students of economics ( 26 . 8 % ) . Of the respondents , 55 . 8 % are female , while the average age is 23 . 6 years . The Taiwanese sample was obtained from the eighth edition of the Technology Innovation Competition ( February 2006 ) .

One of the steps consists of a 3 - day winter camp . It was during this stage that the ﬁeldwork was carried out . Each competing team was made up of four to seven members . Two of them were randomly selected from each competing team and asked to complete the survey . Questionnaires were administered to 180 participants , 132 valid questionnaires being collected ( 73 . 9 % ) . Average age was 23 . 1 years and 42 . 1 % of respondents were female . Again , business is the most common degree ( 60 . 6 % ) , fol - lowed by engineering ( 24 . 4 % ) , the rest being mostly health and life sciences . Regarding EIQ translation , the instrument was originally and simultaneously devel - oped in Spanish and English . Three researchers ( one Spanish and two native English ) made independent bidirectional translations . Any concern or discrepancy was jointly solved . A Chinese version was used in Taiwan , based on the English version and translated by one of the authors . Three graduate students then checked the translation independently . A joint session served to solve discrepancies . Finally , the EIQ was completed by a different student , who found no problems in understanding and answering the questions . Some differences do arise between both samples , as might be expected ( see Table 4 ) . In the ﬁrst place , the Spanish sample includes signiﬁcantly more women . Similarly , knowing an entrepreneur is more common in Spain ( 86 . 3 % compared to 48 . 1 % of the Taiwanese sample ) . On the other hand , even though the proportion of respondents having work experience is broadly similar ( 43 . 4 % to 36 . 4 % ) , Taiwanese students have much higher self - employment experience . These differences might have relevant effects on the variables in the entrepreneurial intention model . For this reason , we will include these demographics as control variables in the statistical analysis . Structural Analysis The entrepreneurial intention model to be tested has been presented in Figure 1 . Structural equation modeling was used to test its empirical validity ( Gefen , Straub , & Table 4 Sample Characteristics Spain Taiwan Total N Mean SD N Mean SD N Mean SD Age 386 23 . 632 3 . 104 125 23 . 088 2 . 978 511 23 . 499 3 . 080 Gender * 387 . 442 . 497 125 . 584 . 495 512 . 477 . 500 Degree studied 385 126 511 Business 71 . 9 % 60 . 3 % 69 . 1 % Economics 26 . 8 % — 20 . 2 % Engineering — 24 . 6 % 6 . 1 % Other 1 . 3 % 15 . 1 % 4 . 7 % Work experience 387 . 434 . 496 132 . 364 . 483 519 . 416 . 493 Self - empl . exper . * * 387 . 023 . 151 129 . 085 . 280 516 . 039 . 193 Know entrepreneur * 387 . 863 . 344 131 . 481 . 502 518 . 766 . 424 * Country difference is signiﬁcant ( p < . 01 ) , * * Signiﬁcant at the 99 . 9 % level ( p < . 001 ) . 605 May , 2009 Boudreau , 2000 ) . However , as a ﬁrst step , reliability and validity analyses were performed for each subsample . Thus , Cronbach’s alphas ranged from . 776 to . 953 . Factor analysis resulted in four factors being extracted ( all of them with eigenvalues greater than 1 ) , fully corresponding to theoretical expectations . According to the theory , external variables will exert their direct inﬂuence only on the intention antecedents . For this reason , control variables are included as explaining PA , SN , and PBC . Age is measured in years . The other four demographic variables are dichotomic 0 / 1 . The value 1 means male ( in the “Gender” variable ) , knows personally an entrepreneur ( in “Role Model” ) , has self - employment experience ( in “SelfEmpl Exper” ) , and has labor experience ( in “Work Exper” ) . The value 0 means the opposite . Therefore , positive relationships are expected for these demographics with the intention antecedents , as possessing these characteristics would be associated with more favorable perceptions . The statistical analysis has been carried out using PLSGraph v . 3 . 00 ( Chin & Frye , 2003 ) . The initial model to be tested was presented in Figure 1 . Apart from human capital and demographic variables , a country dummy has also been included ( labeled Taiwan ) to account for possible cultural country differences . In this case , a direct inﬂuence of this dummy on intention was initially drawn to reﬂect the possibility of the way intentions are formed differing in each culture . After running the statistical software on these data , a number of nonsigniﬁcant path coefﬁcients were found . A recursive method has been used to eliminate the path with the lowest t - statistic at each iteration , until all coefﬁcients were signiﬁcant at least at the 95 % level ( p < . 05 ) . Figure 2 presents the results for the combined sample . As may be observed , the core entrepreneurial intention model is generally supported by this analysis , Figure 2 Results for the Combined Sample E . I . S . N . P . B . C . P . A .

Therefore , hypoth - eses 1 and 2 are conﬁrmed , whereas hypothesis 3 is not . The relative strength of this motivational factor has already been identiﬁed as a pending issue in intention models . It has been argued earlier that the main inﬂuence of SN would be exerted through its effects on PA and PBC . Hypotheses 4 and 5 were intended to test this possibility . They have been fully supported since both paths are signiﬁcant . Demographic and human capital variables have relatively few signiﬁcant effects on the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention and , in general , they are small in magnitude . The signs of coefﬁcients , however , are as expected . Only the effect of gender ( being male ) on PBC is considerably large ( . 225 ) . This model explains 55 . 5 % of the variance in entrepreneurial intention based on PA and PBC . This result is highly satisfactory since most previous research using linear models typically explain less than 40 % . Besides , the model also serves to explain nearly 20 % of the variance in PA and PBC , thanks to the important contribution of SN . These results also indicate that signiﬁcant cultural differences between these two samples probably exist since the country - dummy coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant . Neverthe - less , no signiﬁcant direct effect on EI was found from this variable . This would mean that , starting from perceptions , intentions are formed the same way in the European country and the Asian country studied , pointing to the universal applicability of the planned behavior approach in entrepreneurship . However , there are signiﬁcant differences with respect to levels of those antecedents : PA , SN , and PBC . Taiwanese respondents tend to perceive much lower support in their closer environment ( - . 367 ) than Spanish do . In contrast , they state a higher PA ( . 261 ) and , to a lesser extent , PBC ( . 108 ) . Nonetheless , testing cultural hypotheses ( 6 and 7 ) requires performing separate analyses of each national subsample . Figure 3 presents comparative results for each subsample . Paths that are signiﬁcant in both cases are drawn as a full line . Both path coefﬁcients are included ( Spain / Taiwan ) . Paths that are signiﬁcant in one subsample only ( Spain in all instances ) are drawn as a dashed line . Hypotheses 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 fully hold for each subsample , adding robustness to our results . Meanwhile , hypothesis 3 is rejected in both cases , as it was in the combined sample . Similarly , variance explained by the model is even higher than it was for the combined sample ( over 57 . 8 % ) . Regarding possible cultural speciﬁcities , some notable differences are found between the path coefﬁcients . SN exerts a stronger inﬂuence over both PA and PBC in Taiwan . This result would support hypothesis 6 . This stronger effect cannot be conﬁrmed for the SN – EI relationship since this latter path is not signiﬁcant . Hypothesis 7 stated that the relative inﬂuence of PA and PBC on EI would be different depending on the country . In the Spanish subsample , PA exerts the stronger effect ( . 677 vs . . 169 for PBC ) . In Taiwan , PBC is the strongest predictor of EI ( . 579 vs . . 301 for PA ) . Therefore , hypothesis 7 would be supported . The number of human capital and demographic variables signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing motivational factors is notably different . In Taiwan , there is only one of them , linking self - employment experience to SN . Smaller sample size probably accounts for this lower presence of signiﬁcant variables . The SelfEmpl . Exp – SN relationship holds for both sub - samples . This would indicate that , regardless of culture , having been an entrepreneur before signiﬁcantly improves perceived approval by “reference people . ” On the other hand , age is not signiﬁcant in either sample . This would be probably explained by the short age span considered . A new study of the general population may be needed to more accurately assess the role of age . 607 May , 2009 Discussion The ﬁrst part of this study describes the construction and validation of an EIQ . All items in the questionnaire are based on the theory and have taken previous empirical literature as a reference . In this sense , a decision was made to use aggregate measures for the three motivational antecedents ( PA , SN , and PBC ) . This decision may not be too problematic with regard to PA and PBC . However , with respect to SN , it has been relatively frequent in the past to moderate direct responses about reference people’s approval with their relative “motives to comply . ” The decision was taken to keep the EIQ as parsimonious as possible . Nevertheless , it may be argued that part of the results ( in particular , rejection of hypothesis 3 ) may be a consequence of this speciﬁc design of the SN measure . Previous research using a “subjective norm” ¥ “motives to comply” measure has found a signiﬁcant relationship with EI ( Kolvereid , 1996b ; Kolvereid & Isaksen , 2006 ; Tkachev & Kolvereid , 1999 ) . On the other hand , the simpler “subjective norm” measure has most often been nonsigniﬁcant ( Autio et al . , 2001 ; Krueger et al . , 2000 ) . A speciﬁc comparison of these two alternative measures using structural equations would probably be appropriate to help clarify their relative properties . Then , a modiﬁcation of this measure in the EIQ may be needed . Another characteristic of the EIQ is its consideration of entrepreneurship as not opposed to employee . To test this hypothesis , we used Spearman correlation coefﬁcients ( since the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test suggested distributions were not normal ) . Two items similar to those used by Autio et al . ( 2001 ) were checked . Correlation between “attraction toward salaried work” and “attraction toward entrepreneurship” takes a signiﬁcant value Figure 3 Compared Results for Each Subsample E . I .

Although it is negative , its magnitude is relatively small , suggesting that respondents do not see them as exact opposites . The value for the Spanish sample is slightly larger - . 362 and equally signiﬁcant ( p < . 001 ) , but it is much lower ( - . 129 ) and nonsigniﬁcant for the Taiwanese sample . Therefore , although Spaniards still see them partially as alternative options , it seems that in Taiwan this is not the case at all . Future research should be developed to conﬁrm that these two career options are not perceived as completely opposed . In this case , there would be a strong case for using unconditional measures of both PA and entrepreneurial intention in future research , in line with recent reasoning by Kolvereid and Isaksen ( 2006 ) . The validation procedure has yielded satisfactory results . Scales are reliable and valid when tested on the initial Spanish sample . In addition , the enlarged sample for Spain , and that of Taiwan also offered satisfactory psychometric properties ( although not reported in detail due to reasons of space ) . In this sense , we are conﬁdent that the EIQ may be an adequate instrument to analyze entrepreneurial intentions . The follow - up study will try to verify the intention – behavior link . Based on the ﬁndings presented in this article , strong support for the entrepreneurial intention model could be claimed . The applicability of the TPB to entrepreneurship had received wide empirical support in the past , although not without some exceptions ( Kolvereid & Isaksen , 2006 ) . The originality of this article resides in testing it on a two - country sample , considering the role of culture , with a newly developed instrument , and specifying the structural relations between the intention antecedents . General results are satisfactory since most hypotheses have been conﬁrmed and the explained variance is notably high . In particular , four of the ﬁve original core - model relationships were signiﬁcant . SN would exert its inﬂuence on both PA and PBC ( which in turn explain intention ) , but not directly on intention . Demographic or human capital variables , on the other hand , exert their effect on those antecedents . The existence of direct relationships between external variables and entrepreneurial intention was tested , with none resulting signiﬁcant . Results suggest that the traditional speciﬁcation of the entrepreneurial intention model—based on linear regressions—may not be completely adequate . It would seem that perceived SN does not play a direct role in determining entrepreneurial intention . Its effect would rather be indirect . This holds for both the Spanish and Taiwanese samples . It may be argued that social pressures modify PA and PBC levels . When individuals feel that “reference people” would approve of their decision to become entrepreneurs , they would be more attracted toward that option and feel more able to perform it satisfactorily . Nevertheless , other researchers have found a direct and signiﬁcant relationship between SN and entrepreneurial intention . However , their analyses were based on linear regression models and not on structural equations such as ours . It is important to note that the same hypotheses ( 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 ) are conﬁrmed for the combined sample and for each of the national subsamples . This holds despite national differences between both countries and even some differences in sample characteristics . Therefore , the robustness of the model seems to be conﬁrmed . For the combined sample , a country dummy was included to explain the three motivational antecedents and entrepreneurial intention itself . This latter relationship was not signiﬁcant , whereas the effect on the three antecedents was . This , in our opinion , reinforces the cross - cultural applicability of the entrepreneurial intention model , since intention is explained by its motivational factors regardless of the country . This would mean that the effect of demographics on perceptions differs for each country , depending possibly on cultural and social differences . On the other hand , the formation of intention from its antecedents is essentially similar in both samples . Thus , internal cognitive 609 May , 2009 mechanisms would be the same for all people . That is , the “lenses” through which each of us “see” reality may differ in a cultural or social manner , but our way of “elaborating” on what we have “seen” would be similar . In this case , Taiwanese respondents have more favorable perceptions about their PA and PBC toward ﬁrm creation than Spaniards do . Cultural disparities may be responsible for this difference , as stated in hypotheses 6 and 7 . However , it may also be the case that sample characteristics account for part of this difference since the Taiwanese sample is made up of participants in a business plan competition . On the other hand , Taiwanese respondents have much lower levels of perceived SN . This is more difﬁcult to explain by sample characteristics . Instead , it could be more logically attributed to cultural factors . The role of culture in explaining entrepreneurial intentions is probably very relevant . Cultural values would exert their inﬂuence on the three motivational antecedents and on their relative strength in explaining intention . In our study , two additional hypotheses ( 6 and 7 ) were included to test the inﬂuence of culture . Hypothesis 6 is relatively straightforward since the literature recognizes that individuals in collectivistic cultures tend to be more inﬂuenced by others’ opinions ( Ajzen , 2001 ; Begley & Tan , 2001 ; Mcgrath et al . , 1992 ) . Hypothesis 7 is more exploratory in nature . It derives from two parallel arguments . First , salient beliefs seem to be different between both countries . In Spain , entrepreneur - ship would be more closely associated with enjoyment and satisfaction ( Uslay et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that PA would be a stronger predictor of entrepreneurial intention than in Taiwan . On the other hand , uncertainty avoidance is higher in Spain , so respondents here would feel less capable of coping with the uncertainty of start - up even if they have the necessary skills . Thus , PBC would be a weaker predictor of entrepreneurial intention than in Taiwan . Given the complexity of culture and the exploratory character of hypothesis 7 , our results should be taken with caution until further research conﬁrms them , or alternative hypotheses are formulated and tested . In particular , since sample characteristics are not identical , this difference may explain part of the variation in PA – EI and PBC – EI rela - tionships . Nevertheless , this is one of the ﬁrst attempts to explain the speciﬁc role of certain cultural dimensions in entrepreneurial cognitions . Therefore , we call for new research that may conﬁrm or refute our results . Limitations and Implications Results from this study have to be taken with caution , as some limitations regarding the instrument or the sample may be present . In the ﬁrst place , as previously mentioned , the SN measure may be problematic . Other researchers argue that a “SN” ¥ “motives to comply” measure would be more adequate . If this is true , hypotheses 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 might be affected . A new analysis using structural equation systems with alternative measures of SN may be needed to conﬁrm our results . On the other hand , the fact that the items making up each scale were listed adjacent and always positive may have had an inﬂuence on respondents ( acquiescence bias ) . This study should be replicated with a modiﬁed questionnaire to check the results . Neverthe - less , this problem may artiﬁcially increase reliability and validity measures , but would not per se improve results of the structural model ( sign , magnitude , and signiﬁcance of the path coefﬁcients ) . A sample made up of university students is very common in entrepreneurial intention research . It offers the advantage of similar age and qualiﬁcations , making it more homo - geneous . However , in multinational studies , it is very difﬁcult to obtain fully compar - able samples . In our case , the Taiwanese students were participating in a business plan 610 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE competition , while the Spanish were not . It may be possible that this circumstance has conditioned their answers and , thus , the results . Nevertheless , we ran the analysis only for business students in both countries to make them the most similar possible . Factor analysis results were broadly equivalent and the same happened with the structural analysis . Implications of our results may be derived in at least two areas . First , regarding entrepreneurship education , more attention should be paid to the effect of different content on cognitions ( Kuratko , 2005 ) . Business plan elaboration is the basic instrument provided by the great majority of courses and programs ( Honig , 2004 ) . However , some recent studies indicate that a course consisting only of the production of a business plan may have a negative effect on PA ( Carrier , 2005 ) . Therefore , the case for a wider entrepre - neurship education program would be strengthened . Content speciﬁcally designed to increase PA and SN should be included . In particular , this latter element appears to play a very relevant role . However , we still know very little about ways of improving perceived SN . This is an obvious path for future research . Second , implications for public decision makers could also be derived . If future research conﬁrms that SN is a previous element helping to determine PA and PBC , there is a strong case for the promotion of an entrepreneurially friendly culture in each society . The better entrepreneurship is valued as a career option , the higher the probabilities that people would perceive favorable SN in their closer environment . This effect would be stronger in more collectivistic cultures since the inﬂuence of SN over PA and PBC would be higher there . Every opportunity should be taken to recognize the role of entrepreneurs in the economy . Legal reforms that facilitate ﬁrm creation—for instance—would be important not only as such , but because they transmit the message that becoming an entrepreneur is a positively valued option . Conclusions The present article has addressed some still unsolved issues regarding entrepreneurial intention . In the ﬁrst place , it has tried to test the applicability of the entrepreneurial intention model in two different cultural environments : Spain and Taiwan . Second , it has used a newly developed instrument ( EIQ ) to measure the relevant cognitive constructs . Third , it has considered the particular role of perceived SN through a speciﬁc structural pattern of relationships between the elements of the model . Finally , it has included speciﬁc hypotheses to test the role of cultural dimensions in entrepreneurial cognitions . Reliability and validity measures suggest the EIQ may be generally adequate , although there still may be room for improvement of the research instrument . Results have supported most of our hypotheses . It seems that the model holds for different countries . Cultural and social particularities would be reﬂected by the effect of external variables on the antecedents of intention ( SN , PA , and PBC ) and also by the relative strength of links between these cognitive constructs . In particular , the individualism – collectivism dimension seems to explain the relative importance of SN in the model . Similarly , beliefs associated with entrepreneurship in each culture seem to vary , resulting in the relative strength of each motivational factor being different ( espe - cially , PA and PBC ) . In particular , our results seem to conﬁrm that the cognitive process from perceptions to intention is essentially similar in different cultures . At most , the relative importance of each antecedent in the conﬁguration of intention may differ , but intentions would always be formed based on the three motivational antecedents . National particularities manifest themselves in the way people apprehend reality and transform it into perceptions toward 611 May , 2009 entrepreneurship .
