Results : ESRPs are up - regulated during carcinogenesis but down - regulated in invasive fronts . ESRP1 suppresses expression of the Rac1b isoform , whereas ESRP2 represses epithelial - mesenchymal transition - inducing transcription factors . Conclusion : ESRP1 and ESRP2 suppress cell motility through distinct transcriptional and / or post - transcriptional mechanisms . Significance : Our findings reveal a novel molecular network that regulates cancer cell motility . ESRP1 ( epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 ) and ESRP2 regulate alternative splicing events associated with epithelial phenotypes of cells , and both are down - regulated during the epithelial - mesenchymal transition . However , little is known about their expression and functions during carcinogenesis . In thisstudy , wefoundthatexpressionofbothESRP1andESRP2is plastic : during oral squamous cell carcinogenesis , these proteins areup - regulatedrelativetotheirlevelsinnormalepitheliumbut down - regulated in invasive fronts . Importantly , ESRP1 and ESRP2 are re - expressed in the lymph nodes , where carcinoma cells metastasize and colonize . In head and neck carcinoma cell lines , ESRP1 and ESRP2 suppress cancer cell motility through distinctmechanisms : knockdownofESRP1affectsthedynamicsof theactincytoskeletonthroughinductionofRac1b , whereasknock - down of ESRP2 attenuates cell - cell adhesion through increased expression of epithelial - mesenchymal transition - associated tran - scription factors . Down - regulation of ESRP1 and ESRP2 is thus closely associated with a motile phenotype of cancer cells . The epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) 2 is essential for embryonic organogenesis as well as tissue regeneration and wound healing ( 1 ) , but it is also involved in fibrotic diseases and cancer progression ( 2 , 3 ) . During EMT , individual cells convert from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotypes . EMT is principally characterized by changes in cell morphology , attenuation of cell - cell interaction , and loss of cell polarity , often leading to increased cell motility . These characteristics also contribute to acquisition of malignant phenotypes by cancer cells , including invasion into stromal tissues and distant metastasis ( 4 ) . The EMT process is controlled by four primary regulatory systems : transcriptional control , alternative splicing , noncoding RNA , and post - translational control ( 5 ) . Among these , transcrip - tional control has been explored most extensively . EMT is directly or indirectly controlled by several transcription factors , including (cid:2) EF1 / ZEB1 ( zinc finger E - box - binding homeobox 1 ) , SIP1 ( Smad - interacting protein 1 ) , Snail , and Twist , which are regarded as the most important regulatory components involved in initiating EMT and / or maintaining mesenchymal phenotypes . These EMT - associated transcription factors repress E - cadherin and up - regulate expression of mesenchymal markers ( N - cad - herin , vimentin , and fibronectin , etc . ) ( 4 , 6 , 7 ) . Recent work has revealed the crucial roles played by RNA splicing events during EMT . The RNA - binding proteins ESRP1 and ESRP2 and the RNA - binding protein FOX2 homologue RBFOX2 have been identified as key regulators of splicing events related to EMT ( 8 ) . ESRP1 and ESRP2 , also called RBM35A and RBM35B , respectively , are involved in maintenance of epithelial cell - specific isoforms , whereas RBFOX2 is required for mainte - nanceofmesenchymalphenotypes ( 8 ) . Werecentlydemonstrated that ESRP1 and ESRP2 are down - regulated by (cid:2) EF1 and / or SIP1 during TGF - (cid:3) - induced EMT ( 9 ) . Importantly , this down - regula - tion is essential for EMT progression . Although both ESRP1 and ESRP2 prefer to bind to the UG - rich motif , ESRP2 appears to be less active as a splicing factor ( 10 ) . ESRPs play multiple roles in tumor progression . Down - reg - ulation of ESRPs during TGF - (cid:3) - induced EMT triggers isoform switching of FGF receptors , which sensitizes cells to FGF - 2 ; cooperation of TGF - (cid:3) with FGF - 2 then promotes enhanced EMT with more aggressive phenotypes ( 11 , 12 ) . Furthermore , ectopic expression of ESRP1 / RBM35A suppresses malignant phenotypes of colon and breast cancer cells ( 9 , 13 ) , suggesting that ESRPs are tumor suppressors . In contrast , Yae et al . ( 14 ) reported that ESRP1 is associated with a lower survival rate in * This work was supported by the Vehicle Racing Commemorative Founda - tion ; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science ( JSPS ) KAKENHI Grants 24791764and24592592 ; theresearchprogramoftheProjectforDevelop - mentofInnovativeResearchonCancerTherapeutics ( P - Direct ) oftheMin - istry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology of Japan ; and the JSPS Core - to - Core Program Cooperative International Framework in TGF - (cid:3) Family Signaling . 1 To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Thus , whether ESRPs play positive or negative roles during tumor progression remains controversial . Moreover , although genome - wide determinations of ESRP - regulated exons have predicted that they regulate a large num - ber of splicing events in various genes ( 10 , 15 ) , most of the isoform - specific functions have not been elucidated , except in the cases of CD44 , MENA , and Exo70 ( 14 , 16 , 17 ) . In this study , we examined the expression profiles of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in human normal and tumor tissues . The expression levels of both ESRP1 and ESRP2 were low in normal epithelium but up - regulated in precancerous lesions and carcinoma in situ . Expression was maintained in advanced cancer cells but down - regulated in invasive fronts . We also found that knockdown of ESRP1 and / or ESRP2 promoted cell motility in head and neck cancer cell lines that express these proteins . Knockdown of ESRP1 derepressed Rac1b , a self - activating isoform of Rac1 , whereas knockdown of ESRP2 resulted in repression of E - cad - herin through induction of (cid:2) EF1 / SIP1 . We thus conclude that ESRP1 and ESRP2 suppress cell motility through distinct tran - scriptional and / or post - transcriptional mechanisms . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Lines— Seven human head and neck squamous cell car - cinoma ( HNSCC ) cell lines ( SAS , HSC2 , HSC3 , HSC4 , Ca9 - 22 , Kuma - 1 , and Gun - 1 ) , a human uterine cervix squamous cell carcinoma cell line ( HeLa ) , and a human breast adenocarci - noma cell line ( T47D ) were used in this study . SAS , HSC2 , HSC3 , and HSC4 cells , established from human oral squamous cell carcinomas , were purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank ( Osaka , Japan ) . Ca9 - 22 cells , established from a human gingival squamous cell carci - noma , were purchased from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank ( Tokyo , Japan ) . Kuma - 1 cells , established from a human maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma , and Gun - 1 cells , established from a human hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( 18 ) , were kindly supplied by Dr . Kazuaki Chikamatsu ( Gunma University , Gunma , Japan ) . These cells were cultured in DMEM ( Nacalai Tesque ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inacti - vated FBS , 500 units / ml penicillin , and 500 (cid:4) g / ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . Immunohistochemistry— Formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tissue blocks were sectioned ( 2 (cid:4) m thick ) and mounted on sil - ane - coated glass slides . These slides were then deparaffinized with xylene , followed by rehydration through graded alcohols to water . For antigen retrieval , deparaffinized sections were placed in plastic Coplin jars and heated in an autoclave at 120 °C for 15 – 20 min in 10 m M citrate buffer solution ( pH 6 ) or target retrieval solution ( pH 9 ) ( Dako S2367 ) . Next , endogenous per - oxidase was quenched with 3 % ( v / v ) H 2 O 2 for 5 min . After blocking with 1 % BSA at room temperature for 2 h , the sections were incubated with a primary antibody diluted with 1 % BSA in PBS . Slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary monoclonal antibodies . Primary antibodies and working dilu - tion rates were as follows : anti - ESRP1 , 1 : 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich HPA023720 ) ; anti - ESRP2 , 1 : 100 ( Abcam ab113486 ) ; anti - E - cadherin , 1 : 100 ( BD Biosciences 610181 ) ; and anti - Rac1b , 1 : 50 ( Millipore 09 - 271 ) . Slides were then incubated with HRP using a ChemMate EnVision kit ( Dako ) for 2 h . After the slides were washed twice with PBS , immunoreactivity was visualized with 0 . 6 n M 3 – 3 (cid:2) - diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride ( Dojindo ) , and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin .

The blots were incu - bated overnight at 4 °C . After incubation with HRP - conjugated mouse or rabbit IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) for 1 h , proteins were visualized using Amersham Biosciences ECL Western blotting detection reagent ( GE Healthcare ) . All images were acquired with a Fujifilm LAS - 4000 mini imager and analyzed with Image Reader LAS - 4000 software . This soft - ware was also used to quantify protein bands on immunoblots .

All PCR conditions included an initial denaturation for 2 min at 95 °C . Amplification reactions were performed for 30 cycles under the following conditions : 95 °C for 1 min , 98 °C for 20 s , and 60 °C for 30 s , followed by an extension of 1 min at 72 °C . PCR products were separated on 1 . 5 % agarose gels , stained with ethidium bromide , and visualized using a Printgraph AE - 6932 gel detection system ( ATTO Corp . ) . The gene encoding (cid:3) - actin was used as an internal control in conventional PCR . Quantita - tive RT - PCR using SYBR Green was performed on an ABI 7300 Fast real - time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) as described previously ( 21 ) . mRNA levels were normalized to the level of the mRNA encoding GAPDH in the same sample .

GST - PAK Fusion Protein Binding Assay— Cells ( 5 (cid:3) 10 5 ) were inoculated , cultured for 48 h , and harvested . Rac1b acti - vation was assessed by GST pulldown assay using the Rac1 / Cdc42 activation assay kit ( Millipore 17 - 441 ) . Wound Healing Assay— Cells were inoculated in 6 - well plates . After cells reached confluence , they were scratched with a 10 - (cid:4) l disposable pipette tip . Migration of wound edges was measured at 10 random points on photographs acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope , and then cell migration dis - tance after 12 h was compared with the distance at 0 h . A pre - vious protocol ( 19 ) was used for data analysis . Proliferation Assay— Cells ( 1 (cid:3) 10 5 ) were inoculated in 6 - well plates and cultured for 24 , 72 , 120 , and 168 h . Cells were then trypsinized and counted using hemocytometer . Statistical Analyses— All statistical analyses were performed using StatMate IV software ( ATMS Co . ) . RESULTS ESRP1 and ESRP2 Are Up - regulated during Human Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Carcinogenesis— We first assessed ESRP1 and ESRP2 expression during the progression of carci - nogenesis from normal epithelium to dysplasia and invasive carcinoma . To this end , we examined human dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) samples by immunohisto - chemical staining . In normal human squamous epithelium , ESRP1 and ESRP2 were detected only weakly . Most of the ESRP - positive cells were located in the basal layer , whereas only a few were present in the cornified layer ( Fig . 1 A ) . To the extent that they were expressed , they were principally localized in the nucleus ( Fig . 1 ) . The expression levels of ESRP1 and ESRP2 were higher in dysplastic lesions than in normal epithelium ( Fig . 1 B ) . Epithelial dysplasia can be divided into three catego - ries : mild , moderate , and severe . As the degree of cellular atypia rose , the proportion of ESRP1 - positive cells increased ( Fig . 1 C ) . In carcinoma in situ and advanced OSCC lesions , which can be classified into well or poorly differentiated types , ESRP1 expres - sion in cancer cells was also significantly elevated . The patterns and intensities of ESRP1 expression in each histological type of advanced OSCC were similar to those in dysplastic lesions ( Fig . 1 D ) . A similar expression pattern was observed for ESRP2 in dysplasia ( data not shown ) and advanced OSCC samples ( Fig . 1 E ) . In addition , we evaluated the intensities of ESRP1 and ESRP2 immunoreactivity in 49 human OSCC samples . The reactivities for ESRP1 and ESRP2 were elevated relative to those for normal epithelium in 46 of 49 and 40 of 49 OSCC samples , respectively . These results clearly indicate that human ESRP1 and ESRP2 are expressed in both normal epithelium and OSCC and are up - regulated during OSCC carcinogenesis . Reduction of ESRP1 and ESRP2 Expression in Invasive OSCC— ESRPs are down - regulated in basal - like breast cancer cell lines , which are invasive ( 9 ) . To determine whether ESRP expression levels are altered in cancer cells during invasion into surrounding stromal tissues , we next analyzed expression of ESRP1 in carcinoma in situ and OSCC with invasive pheno - types . In cancer cells that penetrated through the basement membrane to invade stromal tissues , ESRP1 expression was sig - nificantly reduced ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . We also examined ESRP1 and ESRP2 expression in cancer cells that invaded the stroma to deeper locations , as well as in cells that metastasized to a lymph node . In both locations , ESRP1 was re - expressed in the cancer nest ( Fig . 2 , C , left ; D ; and E , left ) but repressed in the invasive fronts ( Fig . 2 , C , right ; and E , right ) . These results suggest that ESRP1 and ESRP2 Differently Suppress Cell Motility 27388 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 289•NUMBER 40• OCTOBER 3 , 2014 a t NO R T H E R N I LL I NO I S UN I V on J a nu a r y 27 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m expression of ESRPs is plastic during invasion and metastasis of cancer cells . We previously reported a positive correlation between expres - sionofESRPsandE - cadherininhumanbreastcancercelllines ( 9 ) . Consistent with our earlier finding , in invasive fronts , where ESRP1 and ESRP2 levels were reduced , we observed loss or inter - nalization of junctional E - cadherin ( Fig . 2 F ) . Thus , ESRP1 and ESRP2 may suppress invasion or cell motility in HNSCC . Expression of ESRPs in HNSCC Cell Lines— To explore the possible suppressive effects of ESRPs on cell motility , we per - formed in vitro experiments using human HNSCC cell lines . We first examined ESRP mRNA expression in seven HNSCC cell lines , using HeLa cells for comparison . ESRP1 gene expres - sion was higher in all seven HNSCC cells than in HeLa cells , whereas there was no striking difference in ESRP2 expres - sion between HNSCC cell lines and HeLa cells ( Fig . 3 A ) . We also examined endogenous ESRP1 and ESRP2 proteins by immunoblotting ( Fig . 3 B ) ; the protein expression profiles were similar . Isoform switching of CD44 mRNA is regulated by ESRPs ( 9 , 14 , 22 ) . Therefore , to assess ESRP activities in HNSCC cell lines , we analyzed splicing isoforms of CD44 mRNA by conventional PCR ( Fig . 3 C ) . In HNSCC cell lines expressing higher levels of ESRP1 ( SAS , HSC4 , and Ca9 - 22 ) , CD44 variant isoforms , including CD44v2 - 10 , CD44v6 - 10 , and CD44v8 - 10 , were exclusively expressed . In contrast , only the CD44 standard iso - form was expressed in HeLa cells lacking ESRP1 . We then designed two siRNAs against ESRP1 and ESRP2 and transfected these siRNAs into SAS and HSC4 cells , in which ESRP1 and ESRP2 are highly expressed ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . Silencing of ESRP1 resulted in switching from the CD44 variant isoforms to the CD44 standard isoform ( Fig . 3 F ) , indicating that ESRP1 is active in these cell lines . In contrast , silencing of ESRP2 did not affect CD44 isoform switching ( Fig . 3 G ) . We next analyzed splicing FIGURE1 . ESRPsareup - regulatedduringhumanOSCCcarcinogenesis .

These results indicate that ESRP2 is also active in these cell lines . Knockdown of ESRPs Promotes HNSCC Cell Migration— Because we observed down - regulation of ESRPs at invasive fronts , we next examined the phenotypic effects of silencing endogenous ESRP1 and / or ESRP2 in HNSCC cell lines . First , we confirmed knockdown of ESRP1 and / or ESRP2 , as shown in Fig . 4 A . Next , we examined changes in cell morphology . Knock - down of ESRP1 and / or ESRP2 induced cell scattering , and knockdown of ESRP2 appeared to be more effective in SAS cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . Although knockdown of ESRPs did not affect cell proliferation in either of these cell types ( Fig . 4 C ) , wound clo - sure was faster in knockdown cells than in control cells ( Fig . 4 D ) . These findings indicate that knockdown of either ESRP1 or ESRP2 increases cell motility , although double knockdown does not increase motility further . Mechanisms of Enhanced Cell Motility after ESRP Knock - down— To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying enhanced cell motility in ESRP - silenced cells , we examined E - cadherin expression and actin dynamics .

Localization of E - cadherin was not affected by knockdown of ESRP1 alone ( Fig . 5 B ) , indicating that ESRP1 affects the E - cad - herin status only minimally . We also examined the status of the actin cytoskeleton in knock - down cells . Remarkably , knockdown of ESRP1 dramatically pro - motedformationoflongfilopodiarelativetocontrolcells ( Fig . 5 , C and D ) , whereas knockdown of ESRP2 had no detectable effect on the actin cytoskeleton . These results indicate that ESRPs play sup - pressive roles in the control of cell motility in HNSCC : ESRP1 is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics , whereas ESRP2 prin - cipally maintains E - cadherin expression . ESRP1 Regulates Splicing of Rac1 Isoforms— We next exam - ined the mechanism underlying formation of long filopodia after knockdown of ESRP1 . Actin dynamics are regulated by the Rho family of small G - proteins , Rho , Cdc42 , and Rac1 . Rac1 has a self - activating splice variant , Rac1b , which is characterized by inclusion of exon 3b ( Fig . 6 A ) ( 23 ) . Exon 3b encodes 19 amino acid residues , the insertion of which induces a conformational change in the switch I and II regions in Rac1b , leading to acti - vation by GDP / GTP exchange independent of guanine nucleo - tide exchange factors , as well as impaired hydrolysis of GTP ( 24 ) . A previous report showed that Rac1b promotes cell motil - ity ( 25 ) . In light of these observations , we assessed the alterna - tive splicing of Rac1 mRNA in HNSCC cell lines . ESRP1 knockdown increased the level of the Rac1b isoform in SAS and HSC4 cells , whereas ESRP2 knockdown did not ( Fig . 6 B ) . Rac1b protein was also significantly up - regulated in ESRP1 knockdown cells ( Fig . 6 C ) ; the protein was active , as assessed by FIGURE4 .

Thus , ESRP1 appears to repress expression of the Rac1b isoform by exclud - ing variant exon 3b from splicing of Rac1 mRNA . Intriguingly , we noted that an ESRP - binding motif ( UGGUGG ) ( 10 ) is pres - ent in the intron upstream of exon 3b ( Fig . 6 A ) , suggesting that ESRP1 directly regulates the alternative splicing of Rac1 mRNA . Next , we examined expression of Rac1b in human OSCC tissues by immunohistochemical staining . Consistent with our in vitro findings , the expression levels of Rac1b were increased in invasive fronts ( Fig . 6 E ) . ESRP1 and Rac1b are thus reciprocally expressed in OSCC tissues . We next investigated the role of Rac1b in the promotion of cell motility by ESRP1 knockdown . First , we knocked down Rac1b in ESRP1 - silenced HNSCC cell lines by transfecting siRNA against the Rac1b - specific exon 3b ( Fig . 7 , A and B ) . Knockdown of Rac1b significantly suppressed the elevated cell motility induced by silencing of ESRP1 ( Fig . 7 C ) .

These results demonstrate that ESRP1 suppresses cancer cell motility by repressing the Rac1b isoform . Knockdown of ESRP2 Increases EMT - associated Transcrip - tion Factors in HNSCC— Finally , we sought to clarify the mech - anism underlying down - regulation of E - cadherin after knock - down of ESRP2 . Because E - cadherin expression is directly regulated by EMT - associated transcription factors , including (cid:2) EF1 , SIP1 , Snail , Slug , and Twist , we examined the expression of these factors after knockdown of ESRP2 . (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 levels were significantly higher in ESRP2 - silenced SAS cells , whereas knockdown of ESRP2 in HSC4 cells induced only SIP1 ( Fig . 8 A ) . Together , these observations suggest that E - cadherin expres - sion is repressed by (cid:2) EF1 and / or SIP1 upon knockdown of ESRP2 . We then knocked down both (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 in ESRP2 - silenced SAS cells and SIP1 alone in ESRP2 - silenced HSC4 cells ( Fig . 8 B , upper ) . Knockdown of (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 was not com - plete , but it was sufficient to compensate for the increase in expression due to knockdown of ESRP2 . E - cadherin mRNA and protein levels were significantly restored by knockdown of (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 ( Fig . 8 , B , lower ; and C ) . As shown by immunofluores - cence staining ( Fig . 8 D ) , E - cadherin re - accumulated , and cell - cell adhesion partially recovered after silencing of (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 in ESRP2 - silenced SAS cells . Similarly , E - cadherin expres - sion was restored by knockdown of SIP1 in ESRP2 - silenced HSC4 cells ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that ESRP2 represses (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 to maintain E - cadherin expression in HNSCC cells . In addition , we examined the motility of cells in which (cid:2) EF1 , SIP1 , and ESRP2 were silenced . As described above , knockdown of ESRP2 promoted cell motility ( Fig . 4 D ) . Additional knockdown of both (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 or SIP1 alone canceled the effect of ESRP2 in SAS or HSC4 cells , respectively ( Fig . 8 E ) . Thus , we conclude that ESRP2 inhibits cancer cell motility by suppressing EMT - related transcription factors . DISCUSSION ESRP1 and ESRP2 , which belong to the RBM family of RNA - binding proteins , were originally identified as epithelium - spe - cific splicing regulators in a genome - wide cDNA expression screen aimed at finding key factors that enable alternative splic - ing of FGF receptor - 2 mRNA in epithelial cells ( 26 ) . They have molecular masses of (cid:10) 75 kDa and consist of three conserved tandem RNA recognition motifs ( 26 ) . Although several recent in vitro studies explored the functions of ESRPs as regulators of EMT - associated alternative splicing , the roles of these proteins in cancer progression remain to be elucidated .

Moreover , it remains unclear how ESRP1 and ESRP2 expression is regulated in the process of carcinogenesis . In this study , we examined the expression profiles of ESRP1 and ESRP2 during carcinogenesis using 49 samples of human HNSCC tissue . The process of squamous cell carcinogenesis consists of several developmental steps , including dysplasia , FIGURE 7 . Knockdown of ESRP1 increases cell motility through up - regulating Rac1b .

ESRP1 and ESRP2 Differently Suppress Cell Motility 27396 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 289•NUMBER 40• OCTOBER 3 , 2014 a t NO R T H E R N I LL I NO I S UN I V on J a nu a r y 27 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m carcinoma in situ , and invasive carcinoma . HNSCC samples are favorable for evaluating expression of ESRP1 and ESRP2 during carcinogenesis because multiple steps associated with HNSCC carcinogenesis can be observed in the same specimens . We found that ESRP1 and ESRP2 were only weakly expressed in normal oral epithelium , where both could be detected in the basal layers . The expression levels of both proteins in dysplasia and carcinoma in situ were higher than in normal epithelium . Moreover , they were also highly expressed in advanced OSCC and cancer nests in metastatic lymph nodes . These findings indicate that expression of ESRPs is elevated during HNSCC carcinogenesis . In contrast , ESRP1 and ESRP2 were repressed in cancer cells that penetrated through the basement mem - brane into the stroma and those invading from cancer nests into stromal tissues . In light of these findings , we asked how altered expression of ESRPs affects cellular phenotypes . ESRPs regulate alternative splicing events in a number of genes associated with reorgani - zation of the actin cytoskeleton and maintenance of cell - cell adhesion , tight junctions , and cell polarity during EMT ( 29 ) . However , these splicing products are often uncharacterized . In our study , we demonstrated that ESRP1 and ESRP2 suppress cell motility through distinct mechanisms , although involve - ment of ESRPs in cell motility regulation has been reported previously ( 10 , 27 ) . First , we found that knockdown of ESRP1 resulted in inclu - sion of variant exon 3b in alternative splicing of Rac1 mRNA , thereby increasing expression of the Rac1b isoform . In ESRP1 knockdown cells , Rac1b modulated actin dynamics to induce formation of long filopodia and augment cell motility . Variant products of other ESRP1 - targeted genes ( MENA and Exo70 , etc . ) are also associated with actin dynamics ( 16 , 17 ) . Taken together , these data indicate that ESRP1 principally inhibits cell motility via regulation of actin dynamics . Second , we found that knockdown of ESRP2 effectively repressed E - cadherin expression in HNSCC cell lines at both the mRNA and protein levels . Several reports have shown that ectopic expression or knockdown of ESRP1 does not affect E - cadherin expression ( 8 , 10 , 22 , 30 ) . We previously found that overexpression of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in basal - like breast cancer cells results in up - regulation of E - cadherin expression ( 9 ) . These observations are consistent with our present finding that ESRP2 contributes to maintenance of E - cadherin expression . Furthermore , we found that among EMT - associated transcrip - tion factors that repress E - cadherin expression , the levels of (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 were significantly elevated in ESRP2 - silenced cells . (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 bind directly to the E - cadherin promoter ( 7 , 31 , 32 ) . Down - regulation of E - cadherin by (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 is associated with acquisition of a migratory / invasive phenotype by epithelial tumor cells ( 32 – 35 ) . In addition , (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 are also direct suppressors of ESRP expression in cancer cells , indi - cating that there is a double - negative feedback loop between ESRP2 and (cid:2) EF1 / SIP1 . It remains to be elucidated how ESRP2 represses (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 . Among the many systems involved in the regulation of EMT , microRNAs ( miRNAs ) have been specifically implicated in the regulation of EMT - associated transcription factors . In particu - lar , a double - negative feedback loop is formed between miR - 34 , the miR - 200 family , and Snail or (cid:2) EF1 / SIP1 ( 6 , 36 ) . It is thus possible that ESRP2 suppresses (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 by regulating miRNA expression . Melamed et al . ( 37 ) recently reported that the alternative splicing machinery competes with the miRNA processing machinery when a pre - miRNA sequence overlaps with active splice sites . However , EMT - associated pre - miRNA sequences ( miR - 34 , miR - 200 family , and miR - 9 ) do not overlap exon - intron junctions , ruling out such a mechanism . Wu et al . ( 38 ) reported that ASF / SF2 ( SRSF1 ) has a splicing - independent function in miRNA processing . Previous reports ( 8 , 10 ) and our own data ( this study ) have shown that ESRP2 is a less potent regulator of splicing than ESRP1 . Therefore , ESRP2 may influ - ence (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 expression by regulating miRNA process - ing via splicing - independent mechanisms . Elucidation of such a mechanism might lead to identification of a novel mechanism of regulation of cancer progression . One of the important findings of our study is the plasticity of ESRP expression during cancer cell invasion and metastasis ( Fig . 9 ) . ESRP1 and ESRP2 were re - expressed in cancer cells that reached the deep stroma and the lymph nodes , whereas cells invading from cancer nests again lost expression of ESRPs . These in vivo data suggest that down - regulation of ESRP1 and ESRP2 is restricted to cells that acquire a motile phenotype during cancer invasion . As noted above , whether ESRP expres - sion has a positive or negative impact on survival rates of cancer patients remains controversial . Ueda et al . ( 27 ) reported that in a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients , the overall survival rate of an ESRP1 - high group was significantly higher than that of an ESRP1 - low group . In contrast , Yae et al . ( 14 ) showed that a high level of ESRP1 expression is significantly associated with a lower rate of overall survival in breast cancer patients , suggest - ing that increased ESRP1 expression is related to the malignant phenotypes of human breast cancer . In this study , we observed plasticity of ESRP1 and ESRP2 expression during malignant progression . Therefore , it would be difficult to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the relationship between ESRP expression andcancerprognosis . Consistentwiththis , analysisofinformation on HNSCC patients in public databases ( PrognoScan ) revealed no difference in prognosis between ESRP1 / ESRP2 - positive and ESRP1 / ESRP2 - negative groups . It is important to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the plasticity of ESRP expression . Previous reports showed that EMT - associated transcription factors ( (cid:2) EF1 , SIP1 , Snail , Slug , and Twist ) down - regulate ESRP1 or ESRP2 ( 9 , 26 , 39 , 40 ) . In contrast , the factors involved in up - regulation of ESRP1 and ESRP2 are relatively unknown . Recently , the Grainyhead tran - scription factor Grhl2 was shown to induce ESRP1 expression in breast cancer cells ( 41 ) . Ras signaling is also implicated in up - reg - ulation of ESRP1 and ESRP2 during carcinogenesis because Ha - Ras - transformed MCF10A cells express higher levels of ESRP1 and ESRP2 compared with parental MCF10A cells . 3 It remains to be determined why normal epithelial cells with low expression of ESRP1 have low motility . In this regard , it is noteworthy that Rac1b was first identified as a tumor - associ - ated splicing isoform in breast and colon cancers ( 42 , 43 ) . A 3 H . Ishii and K .

ESRP1 and ESRP2 Differently Suppress Cell Motility OCTOBER 3 , 2014• VOLUME 289•NUMBER 40 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 27397 a t NO R T H E R N I LL I NO I S UN I V on J a nu a r y 27 , 2015 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m previous report demonstrated that ASF / SF2 , a member of the serine / arginine - rich protein family , acts as an inducer of the endogenous Rac1b isoform by promoting inclusion of exon 3b ( 23 ) . In contrast , we found that ESRP1 represses Rac1b expres - sion by causing the variant exon to be skipped . Similar to the pattern for ESRPs , ASF / SF2 expression is also weak in normal epithelium but increases significantly during lung carcinogen - esis ( 44 ) . Therefore , even though ESRP1 is expressed weakly in normal epithelium , Rac1b is not expressed due to low expres - sion of ASF / SF2 . In cancer tissues , ESRP1 appears to be func - tionally competitive with ASF / SF2 in alternative splicing of Rac1 mRNA . Upon down - regulation of ESRP1 in invasive fronts , ASF / SF2 is likely to freely induce Rac1b by promoting inclusion of exon 3b . Thus , ESRP1 has context - dependent functions in the regulation of cell motility . Similarly , it remains to be elucidated why (cid:2) EF1 and SIP1 are not expressed in normal epithelium even though ESRP2 is not expressed at high levels . Understanding the regulatory networks between ESRPs and EMT regulators may lead to new treatment strategies against cancer progression and metastasis . Acknowledgments—We are grateful to Dr .
