Spatial and temporal regulation of integrin trafﬁc is critical for cell migration and cytokinesis . Impaired integrin endocytosis , because of the loss of Rab21 small GTPase or mutations in the integrin b - subunit cytoplasmic tail , induces failure of cytokinesis in vitro . Here , we describe that repeatedly failed cytokinesis , because of impaired trafﬁc , is sufﬁcient to trigger the generation of aneuploid cells , which display characteristics of oncogenic transformation in vitro and are tumorigenic in vivo . Furthermore , in an in vivo mouse xenograft model , non - transformed cells with impaired integrin trafﬁc formed tumors with a long latency . More detailed investigation of these tumors revealed that the tumor cells were aneuploid . Therefore , abnormal integrin trafﬁc was linked with generation of aneuploidy and cell transformation also in vivo . In human prostate and ovarian cancer samples , downregulation of Rab21 correlates with increased malignancy . Loss - of - function experiments demonstrate that long - term depletion of Rab21 is sufﬁcient to induce chromosome number aberrations in normal human epithelial cells . These data are the ﬁrst to demonstrate that impaired integrin trafﬁc is sufﬁcient to induce conversion of non - transformed cells to tumorigenic cells in vitro and in vivo .

A large fraction of solid tumors are aneuploid and human cells transformed in vitro usually develop chromosomal deviations ( Hahn et al . , 1999 ; Li et al . , 2000 ) . Recently , evidence has emerged supporting a primary role for aneuploidy in promoting tumorigenesis . Mouse models where loss of mitotic proteins results in impaired cell division and induction of aneuploidy , are prone to tumors with a relatively long latency ( Michel et al . , 2001 ; Iwanaga et al . , 2007 ; Jeganathan et al . , 2007 ; Sotillo et al . , 2007 ; Weaver et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , aneuploidy has also been shown to increase susceptibility to carcinogen - induced tumor formation ( Holland and Cleveland , 2009 ) . Polyploid cells are thought to act as an intermediate state during aneuploidy formation . Tetra - ploidy or near - tetraploidy has been detected in premalig - nant conditions and early stage cancers , such as Barrett’s esophagus and localized cervical cancer ( Galipeau et al . , 1996 ; Olaharski et al . , 2006 ) . Impaired cytokinesis results in multinucleation , chromosomal abnormalities and tumor formation in mice ( Fujiwara et al . , 2005 ; Rosario et al . , 2010 ) . Despite these ﬁndings , the role of aneuploidy in tumorigenesis remains unclear , as chromosomal devia - tions , especially extra chromosome copies , often cause a proliferative disadvantage both on the organism and cellular level ( Sotillo et al . , 2007 ; Torres et al . , 2007 ; Williams et al . , 2008 ) . It is therefore important to elucidate under which conditions aneuploidy promotes or suppresses tumorigenesis , and which molecular changes actually promote transformation . Cell adhesion to the matrix is primarily mediated by integrins , which are a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors composed of an a - and a b - subunit ( Giancotti and Ruoslahti , 1999 ) . Normal cells grow in an anchorage - dependent manner and detachment from matrix results in impaired cytokinesis and binucleation ( Ben - Ze’ev and Raz , 1981 ; Kanada et al . , 2005 ; Reverte et al . , 2006 ; Thullberg et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , loss of b 1 - integrin expression impairs cytokinesis of chondro - cytes in vivo ( Aszodi et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , proper cell attachment to the surrounding matrix is a prerequisite for successful cell division . Integrins are constantly endocytosed from the cell surface and recycled back to the membrane to facilitate formation of new adhesion sites . Integrin trafﬁc is critical for adhesion site disassembly , cell migration , invasion and metastasis ( Caswell and Norman , 2008 ; Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Muller Received 21 May 2011 ; revised 10 September 2011 ; accepted 12 October 2011 ; published online 28 November 2011 Correspondence : Professor J Ivaska , Turku Centre for Biotechnology , VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland , University of Turku , Turku 20520 , Finland .

Recruitment of integrin cargo to small GTPase Rab21 is involved in the endocytosis and recycling of b 1 - integrins en - route to the plasma membrane in migrating cells . In addition , integrin trafﬁc to and from the cleavage furrow is required for completion of cytokinesis and inhibition of Rab21 induces failure in cytokinesis ( Pellinen et al . , 2008 ) . Most matrix - binding integrins share a common b 1 - subunit paired with any of the 12 different a - subunits . Thus , the b 1 - subunit is of critical impor - tance in cell adhesion in vitro and in vivo ( Fassler and Meyer , 1995 ) . In many cell types , b 1 - integrins are internalized via a clathrin - mediated endocytosis route . Previous work has demonstrated that two conserved NPXY motifs of the cytoplasmic domains of b 1 - integrins are critical for integrin endocytosis ( Ng et al . , 1999 ; Parsons et al . , 2002 ; Pellinen et al . , 2008 ) . b 1YYFF mutant mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) , in which tyrosine residues 783 and 795 in the NPXY - motifs have been substituted with phenylalanines ( Czuchra et al . , 2006 ) are unable to trafﬁc their integrins and fail cytokinesis when adhering via a / b 1 - integrin heterodimers ( Pellinen et al . , 2008 ) . Derailed endocytosis has been linked to cancer and defective vesicular trafﬁcking of integrin adhesion com - plexes is emerging as a multifaceted hallmark of malignant cells ( Mosesson et al . , 2008 ) and a critical regulator of cell behavior and signaling ( Scita and Di Fiore , 2010 ) . Here , we show that downregulation of Rab21 correlates with increased malignancy in prostate and ovarian cancer samples . We ﬁnd that derailed integrin trafﬁc , because of loss of Rab21 or expression of mutant b 1 - integrin , is sufﬁcient to induce aneuploidy in cells . Furthermore , impaired integrin trafﬁc is also sufﬁcient to trigger the generation of chromosomally abnormal aneuploid and tumorigenic cells in vivo . Taken together , these data highlight a possible link with defective integrin trafﬁc and the generation of aneuploid tumorigenic cells . Results Rab21 is downregulated in human cancer samples Recently , we described that small GTPase Rab21 regulates integrin targeting during cell division and that spatially and temporally orchestrated endo / exocytic trafﬁc of b 1 - integrin is critical for execution of normal cytokinesis in adherent cells ( Pellinen et al . , 2008 ) . Generation of tetraploid cells has been suggested as a possible source of chromosomally abnormal aneuploid cells , which are detected in the majority of human solid tumors . Interestingly , we found that Rab21 mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly downregulated in prostate cancer metastasis compared with samples of normal prostate epithelium ( Figure 1a ) . In addition , expression analysis of published ovarian carcinoma samples de - monstrated a very signiﬁcant downregulation of Rab21 in malignant tissue samples compared with the normal samples ( Figure 1b ) . The downregulation of Rab21 in these clinical samples could reﬂect a role for Rab21 in maintaining a normal cell phenotype . To investigate this , we analyzed the effects of extended silencing of Rab21 in normal human mammary epithelial cells . In line with our previous ﬁndings in human cancer cell lines , continuous inhibition of Rab21 for 3 weeks resulted in accumulation of bi - and multinuclear cells ( Figure 1c ) . Furthermore , Rab21 silencing was sufﬁcient to induce aneuploidy . Two weeks after ﬁnishing the 3 - week silencing , we investigated whether the accumulation of bi - and multinuclear cells had resulted in irreversible aneuploidy , which would be retained even after Rab21 levels return to normal ( because of the discontinued RNA interference treatment ) .

( d ) Chromosome numbers determined from meta - phase spreads 2 weeks after the 3 - week silencing was discontinued to allow for investigation of sustained and irreversible aneuploidy generated as a result of 3 weeks of continued Rab21 silencing ( n ¼ 12 – 17 cells per group ) . A full colour version of this ﬁgure is available at the Oncogene journal online Failed integrin trafﬁc induces aneuploidy G Ho¨gna¨s et al 3598 Oncogene of the control small interfering RNA and Rab21 small interfering RNA - treated cells was analyzed . The majority ( 8 / 12 cells ) of the Scr small interfering RNA - transfected cells were diploid with 46 chromosomes . In contrast , the chromosome numbers detected from metaphase spreads of Rab21 silenced cells were highly variable with 10 / 17 cells having a near - triploid chromo - some number and 16 / 17 of the cells being aneuploid ( Figure 1d ) . Thus , loss of Rab21 is sufﬁcient to generate aneuploidy in vitro and correlates with malignant disease in human clinical samples . Derailed integrin trafﬁc in b 1 - mutant cells results in cytokinesis failure and induction of aneuploidy In addition to Rab21 inhibition , mutagenesis of b 1 - integrin cytoplasmic domains ( tyrosine residues were mutated to phenylalanines : b 1YY783 , 795FF ; here on referred to as b 1YYFF ) results in impaired integrin trafﬁc and failure of cytokinesis in cells cultured on b 1 - integrin - speciﬁc matrixes ( Pellinen et al . , 2008 ) . As long - term exposure of cells to repeated RNA inter - ference transfection may have adverse effects on cells , we used a mouse model with these mutant integrins to further investigate the consequences of repeated failure of cytokinesis induced by impaired integrin trafﬁc . To this end , two clones each of b 1wt and b 1YYFF MEFs isolated and cloned from E13 . 5 embryos , which carry the mutation in germline ( Czuchra et al . , 2006 ) , were used . Immortalization was done with SV40 large T , which in primary MEFs is accompanied by conversion to stable tetraploidy ( a total chromosome number of 80 ) without transforming the cells ( Weaver et al . , 2007 ) . In line with previous work , b 1YYFF MEFs were unable to internalize b 1 - integrins ( Supplementary Figure S1a ) and execute cytokinesis on b 1 - speciﬁc matrix molecules like collagen and laminin ( Figure 2a ; Supplementary Movies S1 and S2 ) . Subsequently , these cells became binucleate compared with the normal cytokinesis of the wild - type cells ( b 1wt _ L0 ) . To investigate the functional outcome of repeated cytokinesis failure , b 1wt and b 1YYFF cells were plated on the b 1 - speciﬁc matrix component laminin to allow for one cycle of cell division . Subsequently , cells were allowed to grow to conﬂuency in the presence of 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( which allows for adhesion via b 1 and b 3 integrins and thus execution of normal cytokinesis in both cell types ) . This procedure was repeated four times ( L4 for four rounds on laminin ) ( Figure 2b ) , after which all of the surviving cells were grown continuously as cell lines for numerous passages under identical conditions on plastic . The karyotypes of the parental b 1wt _ L0 and b 1YYFF _ L0 clones a and b were similar with a chromosome number close to tetraploid ( 4N ¼ 80 , Figure 2c , top ) , as determined by counting chromosomes from metaphase spreads . After four passages on the b 1 matrix followed with normal passaging on plastic , both b 1YYFF clones showed increased aneuploidy with modal chromosome numbers around 64 ( Figure 2c , bottom ) . Importantly , these altered karyotypes appeared stable as the phenotype of the L4 cells has been retained in the cells passaged on plastic for > 2 years . In contrast , identical passaging of the b 1wt clones on laminin had no obvious effects on the karyotype . As both independent b 1YYFF clones had reached near triploid chromosome number and had similar phenotypes , the b 1YYFFa clone was chosen for further studies . To verify the aneuploidy detected by counting chromosomes , a multi - color ﬂuorescence in situ hybri - dization analysis was carried out from six metaphases from the b 1YYFF _ L0a and b 1YYFF _ L4a cells . The majority of the b 1YYFF _ L0a samples had either a near - diploid or a tetraploid chromosome number . In the b 1YYFF _ L4a samples on the other hand , only one cell was near - tetraploid and the rest were aneuploid with chromosome numbers ranging from 53 to 83 . In all six cells analyzed there were also several structural aberra - tions in the chromosomes , such as translocations , deletions , fusions , chromosome fragments and dicentric chromosomes . The multi - color ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization analysis also showed variations in the copy number of individual chromosomes between b 1YYFF _ L4a cells . Representative images from the metaphases are shown in Figure 2d . Array - based comparative genomic hybridization assay was carried out to explore the nature of the chromosomal copy number changes ( Supplementary Figure S1b ) . This assay revealed a small number of deﬁned chromosomal copy number alterations in b 1YYFF _ L4a . This indicates that the predominant change in b 1YYFF _ L4a cells compared with b 1YYF - F _ L0a cells are gross chromosomal changes ( aneuploidy ) , not regional deletions and ampliﬁcations . Aneuploid cells display hallmarks of cell transformation in vitro To investigate how the acquired aneuploidy has affected cell behavior , integrin expression and cell proliferation rates were investigated . No signiﬁcant difference was detected in total or cell surface b 1 - integrin expression between b 1wt _ L0a and L4a or b 1YYFF _ L0a and L4a cells ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . b 1wt _ L0a and b 1YYF - F _ L0a cells showed similar growth rates when prolifer - ating on plastic ( Supplementary Figure S3a ) . However , after plating on b 1 matrix for four passages , which renders the cells aneuploid , the b 1YYFF _ L4a cells proliferated signiﬁcantly more slowly than wild - type cells , which had undergone the same treatment ( Supple - mentary Figure S3b ) . This is in line with the notion that aneuploidy inhibits proliferation in vitro under normal growth conditions ( Williams et al . , 2008 ) . Two hallmarks of cancer are the ability of cells to grow without anchorage and independently of growth factors ( Hanahan and Weinberg , 2000 ) . We observed a signiﬁcant difference in the capability of anchorage - independent growth between the samples . Only the aneuploid b 1YYFF _ L4a cells showed a steady increase in proliferation after 24 h ( Figure 3a ) . Furthermore , the aneuploid b 1YYFF _ L4a cells showed signiﬁcantly increased growth factor - independent proliferation ( Figure 3b ) and resistance to cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor - a treatment ( Figure 3c ) when Failed integrin trafﬁc induces aneuploidy G Ho¨gna¨s et al 3599 Oncogene compared with the stable tetraploid control cells . Thus , aneuploidy is linked to acquisition of several properties of malignant cells . Members of the Ras subfamily of small GTPases are often hyperactivated in cancer and thereby inﬂuence and deregulate many intracellular signaling pathways . However , introduction of oncogenic Ras to normal cells induces cellular senescence rather than cell transforma - tion , suggesting that other alterations are also required for cell transformation ( Serrano et al . , 1997 ) . Interest - ingly , we found that introduction of H - RasV12 to the aneuploid b 1YYFF _ L4a dramatically increased their foci growth and anchorage - independent proliferation in soft agar compared with the same cells transfected with the empty control plasmid ( Figure 3d ) . This suggests that aneuploidy - related changes in these cells have rendered them more susceptible to Ras - induced trans - formation . In contrast , Ras - transfected b 1YYFF _ L0a were not able to grow in soft agar or grow as foci ( Figure 3d ) . In fact , RasV12 slightly inhibited foci growth in the parental b 1YYFF _ L0a cells , thus supporting the perception that these cells are untrans - formed . Introduction of H - RasV12 to b 1wt - L0a and L4a cells did not induce growth of large colonies in soft agar ( Figure 3d ) . Taken together , these data demon - strate that repeated failure of cytokinesis because of impaired integrin trafﬁc is sufﬁcient to cause aneuploidy and induce cell transformation in vitro . Aneuploid b 1YYFF _ L4 cells are invasive in vitro We observed that the b 1YYFF _ L4a cells had gained the ability to execute cytokinesis normally on b 1 - speciﬁc matrix with occasional multipolar mitoses ( Figures 4a and b ; Supplementary Movies S2 and S3 ) compared with the impaired cell division of b 1YYFF _ L0a cells ( Supplementary Movie S1 ) .

Failed integrin trafﬁc induces aneuploidy G Ho¨gna¨s et al 3600 Oncogene impaired integrin trafﬁc , causative to the cytokinesis defect of the parental b 1YYFF _ L0a cells , would be somehow restored or compensated by another mechan - ism in the aneuploid cells . Indeed , the generated aneuploid b 1YYFF _ L4a cells had gained the ability to endocytose their b 1 - integrin compared with the un - transformed b 1YYFF _ L0a cells ( Figure 4c ) . The restored integrin trafﬁc could be partly via a clathrin - independent pathway , as integrin endocytosis in the b 1YYFF _ L4a cells was less sensitive to clathrin inhibitor monodansylcadaverin ( MDC ) than endocyto - sis in the b 1wt _ L4a cells ( b 1wt _ L4a cells 44 ± 2 % and b 1YYFF _ L4a 24 ± 2 % inhibition during 20 - min endo - cytosis by MDC ) . Thus , induction of aneuploidy had allowed for selection of a cell population with altered integrin trafﬁc allowing the cells to circumvent the disadvantage imposed by the expression of a mutant b 1 - integrin . Integrin trafﬁc is closely linked with cell migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo and highly invasive cells display increased integrin trafﬁc ( Caswell and Norman , 2008 ) .

A full colour version of this ﬁgure is available at the Oncogene journal online Failed integrin trafﬁc induces aneuploidy G Ho¨gna¨s et al 3601 Oncogene F _ L4a cells were able to invade efﬁciently into Matrigel , which was applied on top of adhered cells on plastic ( Figure 4d ) . This was integrin dependent because blocking b 1 - integrin adhesion to the ECM with an anti - b 1 antibody signiﬁcantly reduced b 1YYFF _ L4a invasion into Matrigel ( Figure 4d ) . None of the tetraploid control cells b 1YYFF _ L0a , b 1wt _ L0a and b 1wt _ L4a showed any invasive capacity and only formed a monolayer of cells underneath the Matrigel plugs . Derailed integrin trafﬁc results in aneuploidy and tumorigenesis in vivo To assess the tumorigenic potential of these cells in vivo , athymic nude mice were subcutaneously injected with b 1YYFF _ L0a , b 1YYFF _ L4a , b 1wt _ L0a and b 1wt _ L4a cells and monitored for tumor formation for 7 weeks . Animals injected with wild - type MEFs did not form tumors , while all 10 mice injected with aneuploid b 1YYFF _ L4a cells rapidly started developing tumors at the injection site , and these tumors grew steadily during 6 weeks to a ﬁnal average area of B 64 mm 2 ( Figure 5a ) . Intriguingly , the 10 mice injected with non - transformed b 1YYFF _ L0a cells showed very slow tumor development after a nearly 3 - week latency reaching a ﬁnal average tumor area of B 18 mm 2 , suggesting that these cells have become transformed and tumorigenic during the experiment in vivo . Histo - logical analysis of the tumors conﬁrmed them to be highly malignant ﬁbrosarcomas or rhabdomyosarcomas of grade 3 / 3 or 4 / 4 ( Figure 5b ) . Cell lines were generated from the xenografts in order to analyze them in more detail and to determine whether their ploidy had been altered in vivo . Metaphase spreads made from four of the established b 1YYFF _ L4a tumor cell lines demonstrated aneuploidy with chromosome numbers between 52 and 80 ( Figure 5c ) . Aneuploidy was also veriﬁed by karyotyping six metaphases from one of the tumor cell lines . The number of chromosomes ranged from 51 to 74 ( Figure 5d displays a cell with 68 chromosomes ) and 5 out of 6 cells also showed structural aberrations . Out of 393 chromosomes , 41 had structural rearrangements ( B 10 % ) , but none of these were recurrent . Taken together , these data conﬁrm that generation of aneuploidy in this model was sufﬁcient to induce transformation of cells that were tumorigenic also in vivo .

Failed integrin trafﬁc induces aneuploidy G Ho¨gna¨s et al 3602 Oncogene However , we were interested to analyze the tumors generated with long latency from the non - transformed , stable tetraploid b 1YYFF _ L0a cells in mice . We generated four cell lines from individual tumors and analyzed them in more detail . Interestingly , we found that , unlike the parental cells introduced to the mice , these cells were also aneuploid with chromosome numbers ranging from 58 to over 81 . Therefore , these data demonstrate that impaired integrin trafﬁc is sufﬁcient to induce aneuploidy and malignant transfor - mation in cells also in vivo . Discussion Homeostasis of tissues is regulated by cell matrix interactions and changes in the tumor microenviron - ment are linked with tumor progression and increased malignancy . Cell adhesion is critical for normal cell division and impaired integrin function because of loss of Rab21 or mutations in the integrin cytoplasmic domain results in generation of multinuclear cells in vitro ( Ben - Ze’ev and Raz , 1981 ; Reverte et al . , 2006 ; Pellinen et al . , 2008 ) .

Failed integrin trafﬁc induces aneuploidy G Ho¨gna¨s et al 3603 Oncogene thought to act as genetically unstable intermediates during cancer formation . Here , we show that loss of Rab21 is linked with cancer progression in human prostate cancer and ovarian carcinoma samples . Furthermore , we demonstrated that derailed integrin trafﬁc resulting in failed cytokinesis can generate aneuploidy . Our results show that ( 1 ) these aneuploid cells are transformed and tumorigenic in vivo , ( 2 ) aneuploidy has induced phenotypic changes in cells , which allow them to compensate for the disadvantage linked to the expression of the mutant b 1 - integrin and ( 3 ) impaired integrin trafﬁc is sufﬁcient to give rise to aneuploidy and cell transformation also in vivo . Importantly , no drugs or chemicals were used in this study ; instead , a mutation in integrin b 1 that prevents normal cell division on speciﬁc matrixes was used as a means to induce repeated cytokinesis failure and aneuploidy . Aneuploidy is as such growth inhibiting , but may actually promote evolution toward improved prolifera - tion in an aneuploid state ( Torres et al . , 2008 ) . Our data imply that induction of massive aneuploidy generates a multitude of cells with altered phenotypes and local requirements dictate that alterations provide mutant cells with a selective advantage . As an example , we ﬁnd that the b 1YYFF _ L4a cells have regained the ability to trafﬁc b 1 - integrin and this most likely contributes also to the increased invasiveness of these cells . It is becoming increasingly evident that alterations in endocytic trafﬁc are a common feature in cancer cells . Therefore , the fact that altered endocytic trafﬁc of cell adhesion receptors can induce aneuploidy and transfor - mation is fundamentally important and conceptually novel . A tumor - associated b 1 - integrin mutation has been detected in squamous cell carcinoma ( Evans et al . , 2003 ) , but integrin mutations are otherwise rare in cancer . However , we show here that loss of Rab21 expression can be detected in human cancer samples with increased malignancy . This may turn out to be clinically relevant if the degree of aneuploidy was analyzed alongside Rab21 expression levels in clinical samples . Interestingly , cells that lack the small GTPase Rab21 become bi - and multinucleate in culture because of reduced integrin trafﬁc and failure of cytokinesis ( Pellinen et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that extended silencing of Rab21 is sufﬁcient to generate aneuploid cells in vitro . Defects in integrin trafﬁc may therefore contribute to genetic instability of human cancers . Many of the mouse models of repeated failure to segregate one or a few chromosomes per division have led to tumor formation with long latencies ( Weaver et al . , 2007 ; Holland and Cleveland , 2009 ) . In contrast , generation of aneuploidy via polyploid intermediates induced by cytokinesis failure or overexpression of Mad2 seems to be more severe in terms of selection for favorable chromosomal aberrations and generation of highly malignant cells ( Fujiwara et al . , 2005 ; Sotillo et al . , 2007 ; Rosario et al . , 2010 ) . This was also the case in our model , where induction of aneuploidy in vitro gave rise to highly tumorigenic cells capable of growing very quickly as sarcomas in mice . Importantly , we also found that non - aneuploid cells with impaired integrin trafﬁc gave rise to aneuploid tumors with long latency in vivo . This is to the best of our knowledge the ﬁrst experimental demonstration of the link between im - paired integrin trafﬁc and tumorigenesis in vivo . In addition , these data demonstrate that generation of aneuploid offspring is sufﬁcient to generate tumorigenic cells without exogenous expression of known oncogenes or inhibition of bona ﬁde tumor - suppressor genes . Materials and methods Cell culture Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts from b 1wt and b 1YYFF mice were prepared from E13 . 5 embryos of heterozygous matings as previously described ( Czuchra et al . , 2006 ) . Cells were immortalized with the SV40 large T as described by Pellinen et al . ( 2008 ) and cultured in high glucose Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 2 m M L - glutamine and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Human mam - mary epithelial cells were cultured in F12 HAM : high glucose Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium in a 1 : 1 ratio supple - mented with 1 % FBS , 2m M L - glutamine , 10 m g / ml insulin , 0 , 5 m g / ml hydrocortisone , 20ng / ml epidermal growth factor and 50 ng / ml choleratoxin . Small interfering RNA - mediated silencing was done using HiPerfect transfection reagent ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) and DNA constructs were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Chromosome spreads and multi - color ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization analysis Cells were grown to B 80 % conﬂuency in a 10cm plate , 1 m M nocodazole was added to the medium and the cells were incubated B 5h at 37 1 C . The media and trypsin - detached cells were pooled and pelleted by centrifugation , after which the pellet was resuspended in 3 – 5ml 75m M KCl and allowed to stand for 10min at room temperature . Five drops of ﬁx ( 3 : 1 methanol : a - cetic acid ) was added , cells pelleted and the supernatant removed with B 250 m l remaining in which the cells were resuspended . In all , 3 – 5ml ﬁx was added dropwise while vortexing gently . Cells were ﬁxed overnight at 4 1 C and the pellet was washed twice in 1ml ﬁx the following day . Cells were resuspended in 100 m l residual ﬁx and dropped onto a methanol - wiped microscope glass . The samples were dried in a fume hood 10s and on an 80 1 C heat plate 30s . In total , 40 m l Vectashield ( Vector Labs , Burlingame , CA , USA ) mounting medium containing 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole was added for nuclear staining . For the multi - color ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization analysis , cells were incubated with 0 . 2 m g / ml colcemid ( Invitrogen ) for 3 – 4h , trypsinized and pelleted by centrifugation at 1110r . p . m . 10min . The supernatant was removed except for 0 . 5ml and the pellet resuspended by gently ﬂicking the tube . In all , 10ml 75m M KCl was added dropwise while ﬂicking . The cells were incubated at room temperature for 10min , pelleted and resuspended as above . 2 – 3ml ﬁxative ( 3 : 1 methanol : acetic acid ) was added while ﬂicking , after which the tube was ﬁlled up with ﬁxative and incubated at (cid:2) 20 1 C for 30min . Cells were pelleted and resuspended as above , ﬁxative was again added as above . Cells were ﬁnally resuspended in 1ml ﬁxative and analyzed at Chrombios GmbH ( Raubling , Germany ) . Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays The wells of a Costar 96 - well plate with clear bottom ( Corning Inc . , Corning , NY , USA ) were either left untreated or coated with 1 % agarose in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( for Failed integrin trafﬁc induces aneuploidy G Ho¨gna¨s et al 3604 Oncogene anchorage - independent growth ) and 5 – 10 (cid:3) 10 3 cells in 100 m l medium was added to the wells . To measure proliferation , the cells were incubated with 10 m l WST - 1 reagent ( Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) for 1 h at 37 1 C . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm on Envision Multilabel plate reader ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA , USA ) . For the apoptosis assay , 2 . 5 (cid:3) 10 4 cells in 100 m l medium containing 5 % FBS were applied to the wells of a 96 - well plate . After 24h , 10 m g / ml cycloheximide ( Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA ) and 100ng / ml tumor necrosis factor - a ( Peprotech Inc . , Rocky Hill , NJ , USA ) was added . After another 24h , the cells were incubated with one sample volume of Apo - ONE Caspase - 3 / 7 reagent ( Promega Corporation , Madison , WI , USA ) at room temperature for 1h . Apoptosis was determined by measuring the absorbance at 485 nm . Transformation assays For the soft agar assay , a 1ml layer of a 1 : 1 mix of 2 (cid:3) media and 1 . 2 % agar in PBS was plated on the bottom of a 24 - well plate well . After solidiﬁcation of the gel at 4 1 C for 10 min , 600 m l of 2 . 5 (cid:3) 10 5 cells / ml in a 1 : 1 mix of 2 (cid:3) media and 0 . 6 % agar was added on top of the bottom gel . After solidiﬁcation , the gel was overlaid with 500 m l medium and incubated at 37 1 C for 23 days . In the foci formation assay , 750 cells were applied on six - well plate wells in triplicates and allowed to grow for 6 days . The cells were ﬁxed with methanol for 30 min and stained with 0 . 05 % crystal violet 30min , followed by washing in PBS and drying . Invasion assays In all , 25 % Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium was added on top of B 70 % conﬂuent cells on an eight - well m - Slide ( ibidi GmbH ) and the gel was allowed to polymerize B 3h at 37 1 C before adding medium containing 2 % FBS . Cells were allowed to invade for 4 days , while successively increasing the serum content of the medium to 8 % . The cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformalde - hyde for 20 min at 37 1 C , washed with buffer ( 1 % bovine serum albumin , 2m M MgCl2 , 5 m M EGTA in PBS ) and permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 in wash buffer for 10min at room temperature . Cells were stained with 1 : 40 Alexa phalloidin - 546 in wash buffer overnight at 4 1 C . Invasion was visualized using a Zeiss microscope ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy , LLC , Thornwood , NY , USA ) with a spinning disk confocal unit and SlideBook 5 . 0 imaging software ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc . , Denver , CO , USA ) . Z intervals of 1 . 87 m m were taken with a 20 (cid:3) objective . The images were analyzed with the NIH ImageJ software package ( Bethesda , MD , USA ) . For blocking of b 1 - integrin , cells were pre - incubated with 10 m g / ml Low Endotoxin , Azide - Free ( LEAF ) puriﬁed anti - mouse / rat CD29 clone HM b 1 - 1 ( Biole - gend , San Diego , CA , USA ) or control CD29 antibody K20 ( Beckman Coulter Immunotech , Marseille , France ) before invasion into Matrigel supplemented with 10 m g / ml antibody . In vivo experiments All animal experiments were performed in accordance with relevant national regulations and were approved by an animal license ( ESLM - 2008 - 08600 / Ym - 23 ) . In all , 1 (cid:3) 10 6 cells sus - pended in 200 m l PBS were subcutaneously injected into the left ﬂank of 8 weeks old female athymic nude mice , with 10 mice each per cell group . Samples from the biggest tumors were ﬁxed in formalin 24h at room temperature , followed by washing under cold , running tap water for 1h and immersion in 70 % EtOH . The samples were embedded in parafﬁn and slices taken for hematoxylin and eosin staining . The sections were analyzed by Dr Jukka Laine at the Department of Pathology , Turku University Hospital . Array - CGH b 1YYFF _ L4a MEFs were analyzed on the 244K Mouse Genome CGH oligonucleotide microarray ( G4415A ) follow - ing the direct method of the November 2008 , version 6 protocol ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . b 1YYFF _ L0a sample was used as reference sample . In total , 3 m g of digested sample or reference DNA was labeled with Cy5 - dUTP and Cy3 - dUTP , respectively , according to the protocol . Labeled samples were pooled and hybridized onto an array .
