Email : mpopoff @ pasteur . fr Summary Botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) are responsible for severe flaccid paralysis by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions . BoNT type B ( BoNT / B ) most often induces mild forms of botulism with predominant dysautonomic symptoms . In food borne botu - lism and botulism by intestinal colonisation such as infant botulism , which are the most frequent naturally acquired forms of botulism , the digestive tract is the main entry route of BoNTs into the organism . We previously showed that BoNT / B translocates through mouse intestinal barrier by an endocytosis ‐ dependent mechanism and subsequently targets neuronal cells , mainly choliner - gic neurons , in the intestinal mucosa and musculosa . Here , we investigated the entry pathway of BoNT / B using fluorescent C ‐ terminal domain of the heavy chain ( HcB ) , which is involved in the binding to specific receptor ( s ) and entry process into target cells . While the combination of gangliosides GD 1a / GD 1b / GT 1b and synaptotagmin I and to a greater extent synaptotagmin II con - stitutes the functional HcB receptor on NG108 ‐ 15 neuronal cells , HcB only uses the gangliosides GD 1a / GD 1b / GT 1b to efficiently bind to m ‐ IC cl2 intestinal cells . HcB enters both cell types by a dynamin ‐ dependent endocytosis , which is efficiently prevented by Dynasore , a dynamin inhibi - tor , and reaches a common early endosomal compartment labeled by early endosome antigen ( EEA1 ) . In contrast to neuronal cells , HcB uses a Cdc42 ‐ dependent pathway to enter intestinal cells . Then , HcB is transported to late endosomes in neuronal cells , whereas it exploits a nonacidified pathway from apical to basal lateral side of m ‐ IC cl2 cells supporting a transcytotic route in epithelial intestinal cells . KEYWORDS botulinum neurotoxin , Cdc42 , endocytosis , gangliosides , intestinal cells , neuronal cells 1 | INTRODUCTION Botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNTs ) are potent toxins that inhibit the release of spontaneous and nerve evoked neurotransmitters and more specially the release of acetylcholine ( Ach ) at the neuro ‐ muscular junc - tions and other cholinergic endings of the peripheral nervous system . Botulism results in a flaccid paralysis and reduction of secretions , which lead to skeletal muscle palsies , respiratory insufficiency , and death in the most severe forms ( Poulain , Popoff , & Molgo , 2008 ; Sobel , 2005 ) . BoNTs are divided into seven toxinotypes ( A to G ) according to their immunological properties and in numerous subtypes based on amino acid sequence variations ( Hill & Smith , 2013 ; Peck et al . , 2017 ) . A new BoNT type called H has been reported but was characterised as an A / F hybrid ( Barash & Arnon , 2014 ; Maslanka et al . , 2016 ) . In natural conditions , botulism is acquired by ingestion of preformed BoNT in food ( foodborne botulism ) , or after intestinal or more rarely wound colonisation and subsequent in situ BoNT pro - duction ( Sobel , 2005 ) . Indeed , Clostridium botulinum can contaminate and synthesise BoNT in foods , and under certain circumstances , this bacterium can grow and produce toxin in the intestine . This is the case in babies and young children ( infant botulism ) or in adults ( botulism by intestinal colonization ) with predisposing factors such as intestinal surgery , antibiotherapy , chronic inflammation , necrotic lesions of the intestinal mucosa , and anatomical or functional abnormalities of the intestine . An immaturity or perturbation of the resident intestinal micro - biota seems to be the main factor that facilitates the implantation of Received : 31 January 2017 Revised : 7 March 2017 Accepted : 8 March 2017 DOI : 10 . 1111 / cmi . 12738 Cellular Microbiology . 2017 ; 19 : e12738 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1111 / cmi . 12738 © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd wileyonlinelibrary . com / journal / cmi 1 of 18 C . botulinum in the digestive tract ( Arnon , 1989 ; Brook , 2007 ; Fenicia & Anniballi , 2009 ; Fox , Keet , & Strober , 2005 ; Rosow & Strober , 2015 ) . Therefore , most often , the digestive tract represents the entry pathway for botulism . In food intoxication and during intestinal colonisation with C . botulinum , the ingested or locally produced BoNT has to cross the digestive tract epithelium prior to have access to the target neurons . BoNT type B ( BoNT / B ) is commonly associated with numerous cases of food borne botulism or infant botulism in humans throughout the world ( Popoff , Mazuet , & Poulain , 2013 ; Sobel , 2005 ) . Although all BoNT types induce a descending flaccid paralysis , differences in the clinical picture have been observed according to the BoNT type . Thereby , type B botulism is more often less severe and less lasting than type A botulism ( Cherington , 1998 ; Woodruff et al . , 1992 ) . Dysautonomia ( diplopia , blurred vision , dry mouth , dysphagia , and con - stipation ) is more frequent , and the motor symptoms are less pro - nounced in type B botulism than in type A ( Hughes et al . , 1981 ; Merz Bigalke , Stoll , & Naumann , 2003 ; Potulska ‐ Chromik et al . , 2013 ) . BoNT / B seems to have a higher affinity to cholinergic auto - nomic than motor ‐ neuron endings ( Brashear et al . , 1999 ) . BoNT / B and BoNT / A recognize distinct receptors on neuronal cells , synapto - tagmin ( Syt ) , and synaptic vesicle ( SV2 ) protein , respectively , which might account for the differential recognition of neurons by the two toxins ( review in [ Rummel , 2013 ] ) . In addition , BoNT / B and BoNT / A might use distinct trafficking pathways or mode of dissemination from the digestive tract to the target neurons . Botulinum neurotoxins associate with nontoxin proteins ( ANTPs ) produced by C . botulinum to form complexes of variable sizes ( 300 to 900 kDa ) . ANTPs encompass a nontoxic and nonhemagglutinin com - ponent ( NTNH ) and either several hemagglutinin components ( HAs ) or other nonhemagglutinin proteins called OrfX1 , OrfX2 , OrfX3 or P47 ( Oguma et al . , 1999 ; Popoff & Marvaud , 1999 ; Quinn & Minton , 2001 ; Sharma , Ramzan , & Singh , 2003 ) . One of the main role of ANTPs is to protect BoNT from degradation by the stomach acidic pH and digestive proteases . Indeed , NTNH retains a similar structure than that FIGURE 1 HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into neuronal primary cells , NG108 ‐ 15 and intestinal crypt m ‐ IC cl2 cells . Mouse primary cortical neurons , NG108 ‐ 15 , or m ‐ IC cl2 cells plated on glass slides were incubated with HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) for 10 min at 37 °C . Then , the cells were fixed and mounted for microscopy observation . Cells were counterstained with Dapi to visualize nuclei , and m ‐ IC cl2 cells were counterstained with phalloidin ( green ) to visualize the actin cytoskeleton . White arrows indicate neuronal cell bodies with internalized HcB ‐ Cy3 in intracellular compartments . Internalized HcB ‐ Cy3 appeared as numerous vesicular spots in m ‐ IC cl2 cells 2 of 18 CONNAN ET AL . FIGURE 2 HcB ‐ Cy3 passage through polarized intestinal crypt m ‐ IC cl2 cells . ( a ) HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) was added to the apical chamber of polarized m ‐ IC cl2 cells grown on filters for 3 min at 37 °C . Then , the culture medium was replaced with Dulbecco ' s medium . The cells were further incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times , fixed and processed for confocal microscopy . ( b and d ) Intracellular HcB ‐ Cy3 was quantified and expressed as the number of HcB ‐ Cy3 spots in apical , center , or basolateral side per cell .

The cells were further incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times , fixed and processed for confocal microscopy CONNAN ET AL . 3 of 18 of BoNT and assembles with BoNT forming a compact interlocked complex which is resistant to acidic pH and protease degradation ( Gu et al . , 2012 ; Inui et al . , 2012 ; Sagane et al . , 2012 ) . The mode of passage of either BoNT alone or the whole BoNT complexes through the intes - tinal epithelial barrier is still controversial . HA complexes , but not OrfX proteins , have been shown to bind to epithelial cadherin and to disrupt the intercellular junctional complexes between epithelial cells thus facilitating the passage of BoNT complexes through epithelial barrier by the paracellular way ( Jin , Takegahara , Sugawara , Matsumura , & Fujinaga , 2009 ; Lam , Stanker , Lee , Jin , & Cheng , 2015 ; Lee et al . , 2014 ; Sugawara & Fujinaga , 2011 ; Sugawara et al . , 2010 ) . However , it is not clear whether whole BoNT complex or BoNT alone is transported through the intestinal barrier . At acidic pH , BoNT com - plexes are highly stable , but at the neutral or basic pH of the duode - num and jejunum , BoNT complexes dissociate ( review in [ Poulain et al . , 2008 ) . BoNTs alone have been reported to cross the intestinal barrier upon a transcytotic mechanism without the help of HAs or other ANTPs ( Ahsan , Hajnoczky , Maksymwych , & Simpson , 2005 ; Couesnon , Pereira , & Popoff , 2008 ; Fujinaga et al . , 1997 ; Maksymowych & Simpson , 1998 ; Maksymowych & Simpson , 2004 ; Nishikawa et al . , 2004 ; Park & Simpson , 2003 ) . Notably , we have shown that BoNT / B free of HAs is able to translocate through mouse intestinal barrier via an endocytosis ‐ dependent process and rapidly targets in 10 min the enteric nervous system , mainly the cholinergic intestinal neurons ( Connan et al . , 2016 ) . These findings led us to inves - tigate and compared the mode of BoNT / B entry into intestinal and neuronal cell models . 2 | RESULTS 2 . 1 | HcB enters neuronal and intestinal cells The C ‐ terminal domain ( Hc ) of clostridial neurotoxin heavy chains is involved in the specific recognition and interaction with cell surface receptors . Hc has already extensively been used to investigate internalization and intracellular trafficking of clostridial neurotoxins in cells as well as toxin translocation through the intestinal epithelium and dissemination in the subjacent tissues ( Bohnert & Schiavo , 2005 ; Harper et al . , 2011 ; Lalli , Gschmeissner , & Schiavo , 2003 ; Lam et al . , 2015 ; Maksymowych & Simpson , 2004 ; Restani et al . , 2012 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . Notably , we used fluorescent Hc domains of BoNT / A and BoNT / B to analyze the neurotoxin passage and dissemination in mouse intestinal mucosa ( Connan et al . , 2016 ; Couesnon et al . , 2008 ) . Thereby , recombinant Hc from BoNT / B ( HcB ) labeled with Cy3 was used to monitor BoNT / B entry into cells . First , fluorescent FIGURE 3 Inhibition of HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into NG108 ‐ 15 cells and intestinal crypt m ‐ IC cl2 cells by Dynasore . ( a ) Cells plated on glass slides were pretreated with Dynasore 80 μ M for30minat37°C . Then , HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) was added , and cells were further incubated at 37 °C for additional 10 min before being processed for microscopy . ( b ) Quantification of HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into control cells and cells pretreated with or without Dynasore . Fluorescence of intracellular HcB ‐ Cy3 spots ( in at least 20 cells from each of three independent experiments ) was determined , and the results were expressed as relative amounts of intracellular HcB ‐ Cy3 in cells pretreated with Dynasore versus control cells . The level of internalized HcB ‐ Cy3 in control NG108 ‐ 15 or m ‐ IC cl2 cells without Dynasore was arbitrarily assigned to 1 . Data are mean values (cid:1) SD . Differences between means were tested using Student ' s t test , and p values < . 001 were taken to indicate significance ( * * * ) 4 of 18 CONNAN ET AL . HcB was incubated with several cell types at 37 °C for 15 min . HcB nicely decorated the extensions and plasma membrane of primary rat cortical neurons and was visualized in intracellular compartments ( Figure 1 ) . HcB ‐ Cy3 also labeled the membrane of the neuronal cell line NG108 – 15 , but to a lower extent than in primary neuronal cells . Pri - mary neuronal cells likely retain a larger number of HcB receptors or higher affinity receptors compared to cultured neuronal or intestinal cell lines . When incubated at 37 °C for 15 min , the largest part of HcB ‐ Cy3 was localised in intracellular compartments indicating that HcB was efficiently internalised into the NG108 ‐ 15 cell line ( Figure 1 ) . In most cells , HcB ‐ Cy3 was distributed in perinuclear com - partments . Because HcB ‐ Cy3 internalization was more easily moni - tored in NG108 ‐ 15 cells due to the larger volume of NG108 ‐ 15 versus that of primary neuronal cell bodies , NG108 ‐ 15 cells were used in the subsequent experiments . HcB ‐ Cy3 entry was tested is several intestinal cell lines ( CaCo ‐ 2 , T84 , and mouse intestinal crypt cells [ m ‐ IC cl2 ] ) with approximately the same efficiency ( data not shown ) . m ‐ IC cl2 were used as they were found to be a relevant model for analyzing the entry of BoNTs into intestinal cells ( Couesnon et al . , 2008 ) . After 15 ‐ min incubation , HcB was localised in intracellular compartments , which were more scattered through the cytoplasm than in neuronal cells ( Figure 1 ) . HcB ‐ Cy3 entry was investigated in polarised m ‐ IC cl2 cells grown on filters . HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) was added in the apical chamber of the cell cultures that were incubated at 37 °C for 3 min . Then , the cells were washed and further incubated with culture medium at 37 °C for the indicated times ( Figure 2a and 2b ) . The HcB ‐ Cy3 spots were mon - itored in the apical , center , and basolateral side of the polarized cells over time ( Figure 2b ) . Thus , a progressive passage of HcB ‐ Cy3 was observed from apical brush border binding to basolateral endocytic compartments of m ‐ IC cl2 cells within 10 – 20 min . HcB ‐ Cy3 was also visualized in cultured NG108 ‐ 15 over time ( Figure 2c and 2d ) . It is noteworthy that the internalization level of HcB ‐ Cy3 was lower in intestinal cells compared to neuronal cells ( Figure 2 ) . 2 . 2 | HcB enters neuronal and intestinal cells in a dynamin ‐ dependent manner BoNTs enter target cells via a receptor ‐ mediated endocytosis ( Beard , 2014 ; Rossetto , Pirazzini , & Montecucco , 2014 ) , but the precise mechanism of endocytosis according to the cell types is still elusive . BoNT / A has been found to enter neuronal and intestinal cells by a dynamin ‐ dependent pathway in both cell types ( Couesnon , Shimizu , & Popoff , 2009 ) . Dynasore an inhibitor of FIGURE 4 K + depletion impairs HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into NG108 – 15 and not in m ‐ IC cl2 cells . ( a ) Cells were incubated in K + ‐ depleted buffer or in Hank ' s balanced salt solution ( HBSS ) containing 10 mM KCl for 30 min at 37 °C followed by a hypotonic shock of 5 min , and then exposed to HcB ‐ Cy3 for additional 10 min . ( b ) Quantification of HcB ‐ Cy3 entry in control cells and cells incubated in K + ‐ depleted buffer as described in Figure 3 . The level of internalized HcB ‐ Cy3 in control m ‐ IC cl2 cells was arbitrarily assigned to 1 . Data are mean values (cid:1) SD from at least three independent experiments . Differences between means were tested using Student ' s t test , and p values < . 001 were taken to indicate significance ( * * * ) CONNAN ET AL . 5 of 18 dynamin ‐ mediated endocytosis ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) blocks BoNT / A entry into cultured hippocampal neurons ( Harper et al . , 2011 ) . Here , we investigated the inhibitory effect of Dynasore in the entry of HcB ‐ Cy3 in neuronal and intestinal cells ( Figure 3 ) . Cells were pretreated with Dynasore ( 80 μ M ) for 30 min and were then incu - bated with HcB ‐ Cy3 for additional 10 min . As shown in Figure 3a , Dynasore efficiently prevented HcB ‐ Cy3 entry in both neuronal NG108 ‐ 15 cells and intestinal crypt m ‐ IC cl2 cells . However , HcB ‐ Cy3 still decorated the plasma membrane of NG108 ‐ 15 neuronal cells indicating that HcB binding to surface cell receptor was unaffected by Dynasore treatment . To further support the dynamin ‐ dependent HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into cells , NG108 ‐ 15 and m ‐ IC cl2 cells were transfected with the dominant negative dynamin2 K44A as previously described ( Couesnon et al . , 2010 ) and then exposed to HcB ‐ Cy3 . Dynamin2 K44A prevented HcB ‐ Cy3 internalization in both neuronal and intestinal cells ( Figure S1 ) . The HcB entry pathway in NG108 ‐ 15 and m ‐ IC cl2 was further investigated using potassium depletion followed by hypotonic shock , which disrupts the formation of clathrin ‐ coated vesicles and prevents clathrin ‐ mediated endocytosis ( Carpentier et al . , 1989 ; Kovbasnjuk , Edidin , & Donowitz , 2001 ) . HcB ‐ Cy3 internalization was significantly prevented in NG108 ‐ 15 pretreated in K + ‐ depleted buffer . The fluores - cent HcB molecules mainly decorated the cell periphery . In contrast , K + depletion did not significantly alter the HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into m ‐ IC cl2 indicating that HcB mainly used a clathrin ‐ mediated endocytosis in NG108 ‐ 15 and an alternative pathway in m ‐ IC cl2 cells ( Figure 4 ) . 2 . 3 | HcB uses gangliosides GD 1a , GD 1b , and GT 1b but not GM1 as receptors on intestinal cells The specific receptors of BoNT / B on neuronal cells have been identified as gangliosides GT1a , GD 1b , and GT 1b associated to SytI and SytII ( Jin , Rummel , Binz , & Brunger , 2006 ; Nishiki et al . , 1994 ; Nishiki et al . , 1996 ; Rummel et al . , 2007 ) . Does BoNT / B recognise the same receptors on intestinal cells than on neuronal cells for its entry into epithelial cells ? Gangliosides are components of plasma membrane of all cell types , but they are predominantly concentrated in nerve endings . First , we investigated the role of gangliosides in HcB entry into neuronal and intestinal cells . Competition experi - ments were performed between HcB ‐ Cy3 and gangliosides in m ‐ IC cl2 cells versus NG108 ‐ 15 cells . When HcB ‐ Cy3 was preincu - bated with a preparation ( gg ) enriched in gangliosides GD 1a , GD 1b , and GT 1b ( 250 μ g / mL ) , HcB ‐ Cy3 internalization was strongly reduced in m ‐ IC cl2 cells and to a lower extent in NG108 ‐ 15 cells ( Figure 5 ) . In contrast , ganglioside monosialic acid ( GM1 ) ( 50 μ g / mL ) did not significantly impair the binding and entry of HcB ‐ Cy3 into intestinal and neuronal cells ( Figure 5 ) . GM1 was already reported to FIGURE 5 HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into m ‐ IC cl2 cells is dependent of the gangliosides GD 1a , GD 1b , and GT 1b but not of GM1 . HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) was preincubated with ( a ) a preparation ( gg ) enriched in gangliosides ( 18 % GM1 , 55 % GD 1a , 15 % GD 1b , 10 % GT 1b , 2 % others ; 250 μ g / mL ) , or ( c ) GM1 ( 50 μ g / mL ) , for 30 min at room temperature . Then , the mix was added to NG108 ‐ 15 cells or m ‐ IC cl2 cells plated on glass cover slides , and the cells were incubated for additional 10 min at 37 °C before being processed for microscopy . Quantification of HcB ‐ Cy3 entry in untreated cells and cells pretreated with gg ( b ) or GM1 ( d ) was performed as described in Figure 3 . The level of internalized HcB ‐ Cy3 in control NG108 ‐ 15 or m ‐ IC cl2 cells was arbitrarily assigned to 1 . Data are mean values (cid:1) SD from at least three independent experiments . Differences between means were tested using Student ' s t test , and p values < . 001 were taken to indicate significance ( * * * ) 6 of 18 CONNAN ET AL . not be included in the BoNT / B receptor ganglioside moiety on neuronal cells ( Dong et al . , 2003 ; Nishiki et al . , 1996 ) . To further evidence the role of gangliosides int HcB entry into m ‐ IC cl2 cells , the cells were treated with DL ‐ threo ‐ 1 ‐ phenyl ‐ 2 ‐ palmitoyl ‐ amino ‐ 3 ‐ morpholino ‐ 1 ‐ propanol ( PPMP ) , an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase . HcB ‐ Cy3 internalization in cells exposed to PPMP was significantly lower compared to untreated control cells , whereas subsequent loading with exogenous gangliosides enriched in GD 1a , GD 1b , and GT 1b restored the entry into cells ( Figure 6 ) further supporting the BoNT / B receptor role of gangliosides . 2 . 4 | HcB uptake in intestinal cells does not require synaptotagmin Synaptotagmin is a Ca + + sensor anchored in synaptic vesicle mem - brane of neuronal cells , and the isoforms SytI and SytII have been iden - tified as BoNT / B receptors ( review in [ Rummel , 2013 ] ) . SytI and SytII are also expressed in intestinal cells ( Figure S2 ) . Competition experi - ments were performed by preincubating HcB ‐ Cy3 with a 10 ‐ fold excess of SytI or SytII and then incubating the mix with cells for 10 min ( Figure 7 ) . SytII and to a lower extent SytI induced a significant but par - tial decrease in HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into NG108 ‐ 15 cells . Indeed , preincubation with SytI or SytII decreased HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into neuro - nal cells by 30 % and 50 % ( Figure 7 ) , respectively , in agreement with previous report ( Nishiki et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , no significant inhibi - tory effect of SytI or SytII was observed in HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into m ‐ IC cl2 cells indicating that SytI and SytII are not required for HcB uptake in intestinal cells . Because the functional BoNT / B receptor on neuronal cells con - sists of an association of gangliosides and Syt ( Jin et al . , 2006 ; Nishiki et al . , 1994 ; Nishiki et al . , 1996 ; Rummel et al . , 2007 ) , we performed competition experiments with combinations of gg and SytI or SytII . A stronger decrease ( 80 % ) in HcB ‐ Cy3 internalization into NG108 ‐ 15 cells was obtained by preincubation of HcB ‐ Cy3 with gg associated with SytI or SytII ( Figure 8 ) , compared to incubation with SytI or SytII alone , 30 % and 50 % inhibition , respectively ( Figure 7 ) . This further confirms that HcB requires both gg and Syt for efficient internalization into neuronal cells . In contrast , preincubation with SytI or SytII did not significantly prevent HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into m ‐ IC cl2 cells , and the combination of gg and Syt did not induce additional inhibitory effect compared to gg alone ( Figures 5 and 8 ) indicating that gangliosides , mainly GD 1a / GD 1b / GT 1b , were sufficient to mediate HcB entry into m ‐ IC cl2 cells . 2 . 5 | HcB enters neuronal and intestinal cells via a common early endosomal compartment and then follows a distinct nonacidic pathway in intestinal cells Entry pathways of HcB into m ‐ IC cl2 and NG108 ‐ 15 cells were investi - gated by colocalization of HcB ‐ Cy3 with markers of specific endosomal compartments . After 10 min incubation at 37 °C with both cell types , HcB ‐ Cy3 was distributed in vesicles containing the Rab5 effector early endosome antigen 1 ( EEA1 ; Figure 9 ) . Then , endocytosed cargos in early endosomes ( EE ) can be sortedand transported in distinct intracellular pathways . A major pathway includes the late endosomes ( LE ) / lysosomes . Rab7 is classically considered as associated with LE / lysosomes . However , Rab5 replacement by Rab7 occurs in EE , and Rab7 seems to have an earlier role in the trafficking between EE and FIGURE 6 Inhibition of ganglioside synthesis impairs HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into m ‐ IC cl2 cells . ( a ) Untreated cells and cells treated with PPMP ( 7 . 5 μ g / mL ) for 48 hr were exposed to HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) for 10 min . For ganglioside complementation , the cells treated with PPMP for 24 hr were supplemented with the mixture of gangliosides enriched in GD 1a , GD 1b , and GT 1b ( 250 μ g / mL ; PPMP + gg ) . ( b ) Quantification of HcB ‐ Cy3 entry in untreated cells and cells pretreated with PPMP or PPMP + gg was performed as described in Figure 3 . The level of internalized HcB ‐ Cy3 in control m ‐ IC cll cells was arbitrarily assigned to 1 . Data are mean values (cid:1) SD from at least three independent experiments . Differences between means were tested using Student ' s t test , and p values < 0 . 001 were taken to indicate significance ( * * * ) CONNAN ET AL . 7 of 18 LE / lysosomes ( review in [ Girard et al . , 2014 ] ) . As shown in Figure 10 , HcB ‐ Cy3 was found in vesicles containing Rab7 in both m ‐ IC cl2 cells and NG108 ‐ 15 cells after 10 ‐ min incubation at 37 °C . However , HcB ‐ Cy3 colocalized differently with lysosomal ‐ associated membrane protein1 ( Lamp1 ) , whichisaspecificmarkerofLE / lysosomes , inm ‐ IC cl2 cells and NG108 ‐ 15 cells ( Figure 10 ) . In NG108 ‐ 15 cells , HcB ‐ Cy3 was progressivelyassociatedwithLamp1compartmentsovertimefrom5to 20 min ( Figure 11a and 11c ) . At 20 min , most of HcB ‐ Cy3 was localized in NG108 ‐ 15 LE / lysosomes , whereas in m ‐ IC cl2 cells , only a low level of the fluorescent protein was detected in this intracellular pathway ( Figure 11b and 11c ) . These results support that the cellular trafficking of HcB differs in neuronal and epithelial intestinal cells . 2 . 6 | HcB enters intestinal cells via Cdc42 ‐ dependent pathway RhoGTPases are key regulators that control various cellular functions including diverse endocytosis pathways ( Etienne ‐ Manneville & Hall , 2002 ) . Notably , Cdc42 was found to control a clathrin ‐ independent endocytic process termed the clathrin ‐ independent carrier / glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) ‐ anchored protein ‐ enriched early endocytic compartment ( GEEC ) pathway and was associated with the endocytosis of GPI ‐ anchored proteins , fluid markers , and toxins such as Helicobacter pylori VacA ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ; Sabharanjak , Sharma , Parton , & Mayor , 2002 ) . Transfection of a Cdc42 negative mutant ( Cdc42T17N ) fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) into m ‐ IC cl2 cells significantly inhibited the entry of HcB ‐ Cy3 . None or only a few endocytic vesicles stained with HcB ‐ Cy3 were observed in transfected cells compared to untransfected cells ( Figure 12 ) . In contrast in NG108 ‐ 15 cells , HcB ‐ Cy3 entry was either unimpaired or only weakly compared to untransfected cells ( Figure 12 ) . Transfection of the dominant negative forms of RhoA ( RhoA T17N ‐ GFP ) or Rac1 ( Rac1 T17N ‐ GFP ) in m ‐ IC cl2 cells and NG108 ‐ 15 cells did not signifi - cantly prevent HcB ‐ Cy3 entry ( Figure S3 ) . 3 | DISCUSSION As monitored with HcB ‐ Cy3 , the fluorescent protein bound to the periphery of neuronal cells as well as of intestinal cells and then entered into endocytic vesicles . This raises the question whether BoNT / B recognizes the same specific receptors on both neuronal and intestinal cells ? SytI or SytII in combination with gangliosides , mainly GD 1a / GD 1b / GT 1b , were identified as specific BoNT / B receptors on neuronal cells ( Chai et al . , 2006 ; Jin et al . , 2006 ; Nishiki et al . , 1994 ; Nishiki et al . , 1996 ; Nishiki et al . , 1996 ; Rummel et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , SytI or SytII were shown to mediate BoNT / B entry into PC12 cells ( Dong et al . , 2003 ) . We also confirm that HcB interacts with NG108 – 15 through both gangliosides GD 1a / GD 1b / GT 1b and SytI or SytII by using binding competition experi - ments ( Figures 4 – 7 , and 8 ) . The combinations of gangliosides with the receptor protein part ( SytI or SytII ) were more effective than the individual preparations of gangliosides or Syt in binding inhibi - tion of HcB to NG108 ‐ 15 cells . This supports that the high ‐ affinity FIGURE 7 HcB ‐ Cy3 entry into m ‐ IC cl2 cells is not dependent of synaptotagmin ( Syt ) I and II . HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) was preincubated with the recombinant domain of ( a ) SytI or ( c ) SytII ( 25 μ g / mL ) for 30 min at room temperature . Then the mix was added to NG108 ‐ 15 cells or m ‐ IC cl2 cells plated on glass cover slides , and the cells were incubated for additional 10 min at 37 °C before being processed for microscopy . HcB ‐ Cy3 entry was quantified in control cells and cells pretreated with ( b ) SytI or ( d ) SytII as described in Figure 3 .

In contrast , HcB binding to m ‐ IC cl2 cells was fully prevented by gangliosides alone without the help of a protein part such as SytI or SytII . Thereby , SytI or SytII were not involved in HcB receptor on intestinal cells , and gangliosides of the GD 1a / GD 1b / GT 1B series seemed efficient and sufficient receptors for BoNT / B . SytI and SytII are mainly expressed in neuronal cells where they are localised on synaptic vesicle membrane and play a critical role in the evoked release of neurotransmitters ( Sudhof , 2013 ) . In addi - tion , SytI has been found to be involved in endocytosis of some compounds such as Na + ‐ H + exchanger in intestinal epithelial cells ( Musch et al . , 2010 ) . We also observed that intestinal epithelial cells expressed SytI and SytII using Western blot ( Figure S2 ) . Moreover , SytI and SytII were visualised in m ‐ IC cl2 by cell imaging with specific antibodies ( Figure S2 ) . It is noteworthy that m ‐ IC cl2 retains a stem cell profile and can express a wide variety of proteins ( Bens et al . , 1996 ) . However , SytI and SytII were not detected by cell imaging in mouse intestinal epithelial cells ( Connan et al . , 2016 ) , indicating that these proteins are probably weakly expressed in mouse intesti - nal epithelial cells or only in some cell subpopulations . This further excludes that SytI and SytII have a role in BoNT / B endocytosis in epithelial cells . The role of gangliosides in HcB entry into intestinal cells was fur - ther supported by inhibiting the ganglioside synthesis in m ‐ IC cl2 cells with PPMP ( Figure 6 ) . However , this does not preclude the possibility that membrane proteins of intestinal cells might be used in combina - tion with gangliosides for higher BoNT / B affinity receptors . Indeed , BoNT / B did not localize in all cell types of the mouse intestinal epithe - lium but only in specific cells that represent a preferential passage of the toxin through the intestinal barrier ( Connan et al . , 2016 ) . In con - trast , BoNT / A , which uses SV2C as protein receptor on neuronal cells ( review in [ Rummel , 2013 ] ) , enters intestinal cells in a SV2C ‐ dependent manner albeit this molecule has not been evidenced as a BoNT / A receptor in epithelial cells ( Couesnon , Molgo , Connan , & Popoff , 2012 ; Elias et al . , 2011 ) . This suggests that SV2C might facilitate endocytosis into epithelial cells in a nonspecific manner . However , competition assays with SV2C L4 luminal domain and HcB ‐ Cy3 in m ‐ IC cL2 cells showed that HcB entry into intestinal cells was not mediated by SV2C ( Figure S4 ) . HcB ‐ Cy3 internalization into endocytic vesicles was shown in both neuronal and intestinal cells . However , the distribution of endocytic vesicles containing HcB ‐ Cy3 in both cell types was slightly different . In NG108 ‐ 15 cells , HcB ‐ Cy3 entered endocytic compartments , which migrated in the perinuclear area , whereas in m ‐ IC cl2 cells , the vesicles containing HcB ‐ Cy3 had a more scattered distribution through the cytoplasm ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . This supports a different trafficking of BoNT / B in intestinal cells versus neuronal cells resulting in a delivery of the whole and active neurotoxin to the basolateral side of intestinal FIGURE 8 Both gangliosides ( GD 1a and GT 1b ) and synaptotagmin are required for HcB entry into neuronal cells . HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) was preincubated with both a preparation ( gg ) enriched in gangliosides ( 18 % GM1 , 55 % GD 1a , 15 % GD 1b , 10 % GT 1b , 2 % others ; 250 μ g / mL ) and the recombinant domain of ( a ) SytI or ( c ) SytII ( 25 μ g / mL ) for 30 min at room temperature . Then the mix was added to NG108 ‐ 15 cells and m ‐ IC cl2 cells plated on glass cover slides , and the cells were incubated for additional 10 min at 37 °C before being processed for microscopy . HcB ‐ Cy3 entry was quantified in control cells and cells pretreated with gg and ( b ) SytI or gg and ( d ) SytII as described in Figure 3 . Data are mean values (cid:1) SD from at least three independent experiments . Differences between means were tested using Student ' s t test , and p values < . 001 were taken to indicate significance ( * * * ) CONNAN ET AL . 9 of 18 cells . In contrast , in target neuronal cells , the neurotoxin is transported in acidic compartments , which trigger the translocation of the L chain into the cytosol and its subsequent proteolytic activity towards the soluble N ‐ ethylmaleimide ‐ sensitive ‐ factor attachment receptor ( SNARE ) synaptobrevin ( Keller , Cai , & Neale , 2004 ; Poulain et al . , 2008 ; Simpson , Coffield , & Bakry , 1994 ) . HcB ‐ Cy3 uptake was efficiently blocked by Dynasore , which is a specific inhibitor of dynamin ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) in both neuronal NG108 ‐ 15 and intestinal m ‐ IC cl2 cells ( Figure 3 ) . However , Dynasore not only blocks dynamin ‐ dependent endocytosis but also induces dynamin ‐ independent effects such as reduction of membrane choles - terol , disorganisation of lipid rafts , and prevention of actin filament for - mation involved in membrane ruffling ( Preta , Cronin , & Sheldon , 2015 ) . Thus , Dynasore could also impair dynamin ‐ independent endocytosis such as macropinocytosis or fluid phase endocytosis ( Preta et al . , 2015 ) . The dynamin ‐ dependent entry of HcB ‐ Cy3 into both cell types was further supported by using transfection with the dominant nega - tive dynamin2 K44A ( Figure S1 ) . A dynamin ‐ based endocytosis has also been evidenced in BoNT / A entry into cells ( Couesnon et al . , 2009 ; Harper et al . , 2011 ; Meng , Wang , Lawrence , & Dolly , 2013 ) . Moreover , K + ‐ depletion experiments indicated that HcB preferentially used a clathrin ‐ independent endocytosis into m ‐ IC cl2 cells , contrarily to NG108 ‐ 15 in which HcB uptake was clathrin ‐ mediated ( Figure 4 ) . Indeed , BoNT / B , like BoNT / A , enters neuronal cells , notably at the neuromuscular junctions , via a clathrin ‐ mediated endocytosis hijacking , at least in part , the synaptic vesicle recycling ( Meng et al . , 2013 ; Poulain et al . , 2008 ; Rossetto et al . , 2014 ) . Thereby , HcB likely exploited a clathrin ‐ mediated entry into neuronal cells and mainly a clathrin ‐ independent pathway into intestinal cells , both mechanisms of uptake being regulated by dynamin . Interestingly , toxins , which recognize glycolipid receptors , use mainly clathrin ‐ independent endocytosis . Toxin binding to membrane glycolipids such as Shiga toxin to globotriosylceramide or cholera toxin to GM1 induces lipid reorganisation ( Pezeshkian et al . , 2016 ; Watkins et al . , 2014 ) , leading to membrane curvature without clathrin ( Ewers et al . , 2010 ; Romer et al . , 2007 ) . Membrane invaginations containing toxins are then detached from the plasma membrane through a dynamin ‐ dependent process . This endocytic process is also shared by FIGURE 9 HcB ‐ Cy3 enters NG108 ‐ 15 and m ‐ IC cl2 cells through early endosomes . ( a ) HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) was incubated with NG108 ‐ 15 cells or m ‐ IC cl2 cells plated on glass slides for 10 min at 37 °C .

The mean values (cid:1) SD of the Pearson ' s correlation coefficient of 20 – 30 cells from at least three independent experiments are shown 10 of 18 CONNAN ET AL . endogenous proteins such as galectins ( Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) . BoNT / B possibly uses a similar mechanism of binding to gangliosides GD 1a / GD 1b / GT 1b to trigger a clathrin ‐ independent endocytosis in intestinal epithelial cells . Cargo molecules attached to membrane receptor are internalized into EE , and then are sorted into multiple endocytic pathways such as recycling to the plasma membrane , transcytosis to the opposite side , or sorted to degradative compartments ( LE / lysosomes ) . Endocytic ves - icles are dynamic structures that mature by different ways including fusion with homotypic vesicles or other compartments , or budding and fission in smaller vesicles . Rab proteins are key players in fusion of homotypic endosomes . EEA1 binds to Rab5 ‐ GTP and additional effectors such as phosphatidylinositol ‐ 3 ‐ phosphate ( PI3P ) and syntaxin ‐ 6 in sorting EE where it has a tethering or docking role before membrane fusion . In polarized epithelial cells , EEA1 is distributed in basolateral sorting endosomes but not in apical endosomal compart - ment suggesting that EEA1 is involved in specific directional endocytic pathway ( Christoforidis , McBride , Burgoyne , & Zerial , 1999 ; Shin et al . , 2005 ; Simonsen et al . , 1998 ; Wandinger ‐ Ness & Zerial , 2014 ; Wilson et al . , 2000 ) . Molecules endocytosed by the typical clathrin ‐ dependent pathway as well as by clathrin ‐ independent pathways are internalized into EE labeled with Rab5 and EEA1 ( Grant & Donaldson , 2009 ; Howes , Mayor , & Parton , 2010 ; Kalia et al . , 2006 ; Maldonado ‐ Baez , Williamson , & Donaldson , 2013 ; Mayor & Pagano , 2007 ) . Subsequent maturation of EE into LE is mediated through replacement of Rab5 by Rab7 ( Poteryaev , Datta , Ackema , Zerial , & Spang , 2010 ; Rink , Ghigo , Kalaidzidis , & Zerial , 2005 ) . Thus , Rab7 is found in EE and its activity seems to be required in the late trafficking step from LE to lysosome ( Feng , Press , & Wandinger ‐ Ness , 1995 ) , but also in early endosomal sorting in a cargo ‐ dependent manner ( Girard et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we showed that HcB ‐ Cy3 enters an early endosomal compartment labeled with EEA1 and Rab7 at 10 ‐ min incubation in both neuronal and intes - tinal cells , although HcB was internalized by a clathrin ‐ dependent pathway in NG108 ‐ 15 cells and by a clathrin ‐ independent pathway in m ‐ IC cl2 cells . Then HcB was transported in distinct intracellular path - ways according to the cell type . Overtime from 5 to 20 min , HcB ‐ Cy3 migrated from EE to LE as monitored with Lamp1 in NG108 ‐ 15 cells , whereas HcB used a distinct pathway in m ‐ IC cl2 cells avoiding the pas - sage in LE / lysosomes ( Figure 11a – c ) . Therefore , our findings support the hypothesis that the transport in the LE pathway in neuronal cells , FIGURE 10 HcB ‐ Cy3 enters NG108 ‐ 15 cells and m ‐ IC cl2 cells through an early Rab7 compartment . ( a ) HcB ‐ Cy3 ( 2 . 5 μ g / mL ) was incubated with NG108 ‐ 15 or m ‐ IC cl2 cells plated on glass slides for 10 min at 37 °C . Then , the cells were fixed , permeabilized , and stained with antibodies against Rab7 . ( b ) Quantification of colocalization between HcB ‐ Cy3 and anti ‐ Rab7 . Colocalization index was determined as Pearson ' s coefficient . The distribution of cell structures recognized by HcB ‐ Cy3 was expressed as the ratio of the number of cell structures costained with HcB ‐ Cy3 and anti ‐ Rab7 to the total of cell structures labelled with anti ‐ Rab7 . The mean values (cid:1) SD of the Pearson ' s correlation coefficient of 20 – 30 cells from at least three independent experiments are shown CONNAN ET AL . 11 of 18 where the endocytic vesicles are acidified , facilitates the translocation of the L chain into the cytosol and its subsequent inhibitory activity on the neurotransmitter exocytosis machinery . In contrast to neuronal cells , the whole neurotoxin transits through nonacidified vesicles in epithelial cells and is released to the basolateral side in an undissoci - ated form . Similar findings were observed with BoNT / A ( Couesnon et al . , 2009 ) . HcB transport in intestinal cells was further investigated by ana - lyzing the effects of RhoGTPases that are involved in various cellular functions notably in the control of the actin cytoskeleton and also in different endocytic pathways ( Hall , 2012 ) . In the epithelial intestinal m ‐ IC cl2 cells , HcB ‐ Cy3 was transported in a Cdc42 ‐ dependent and Rho ‐ and Rac ‐ independent pathway , whereas RhoGTPases were not involved in HcB trafficking in neuronal NG108 ‐ 15 cells ( Figure 12 and Figure S3 ) . Cdc42 is a GTPase of the Rho family , which controls certain cortical actin formations like filopodia , cell polarity in all cell types , as well as several intracellular vesicle trafficking and endocytosis pathways including caveolae endocytosis ( Cheng et al . , 2010 ; Chi , Wang , Huang , Stamnes , & Chen , 2013 ; Etienne ‐ Manneville & Hall , 2002 ; Tapon & Hall , 1997 ) . In addition , Cdc42 controls transcytosis from apical to basolateral side in polarized epithelial cells ( Harris & Tepass , 2010 ; Rojas , Ruiz , Leung , Jou , & Apodaca , 2001 ) such as transcytosis of Escherichia coli Shiga ‐ like toxin through intestinal epi - thelial cells ( Malyukova et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , Cdc42 mediates clathrin ‐ independent endocytosis of GPI ‐ anchored proteins , fluid phase markers , and toxins in nonneuronal cells such as Helicobacter pylori VacA , BoNT / A , and cholera toxin subunit B ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2016 ; Couesnon et al . , 2009 ; Gauthier et al . , 2005 ; Malyukova et al . , 2009 ; Sabharanjak et al . , 2002 ; Zachos , Alamelumangpuram , Lee , Wang , & Kovbasnjuk , 2014 ) . The HcB Cdc42 ‐ dependent entry pathway is distinct from that of GEEC , which is associated with GPI ‐ anchored protein uptake and lipid bound ligands , because in contrast to the HcB pathway , GEEC is dynamin ‐ independent and is acidified ( Zachos et al . , 2014 ) . However , HcB was not transported in the acidified route leading to LE / lysosomes in intestinal cells contrarily to neuronal cells . Cdc42 might regulate several clathrin ‐ independent pathways . Thus , in contrast to neuronal cells , HcB similarly to BoNT / A ( Couesnon et al . , 2010 ) used a Cdc42 ‐ dependent transcytosis in intestinal cells , which still remains to be defined . In conclusion , HcB used distinct entry pathways in neuronal and intestinal cells . HcB recognized gangliosides ( GD 1a , GD 1b , and GT 1B ) / Syts on neuronal cells , whereas gangliosides alone seemed sufficient to facilitate the toxin entry into intestinal cells . In both cell types , HcB uptake was dynamin ‐ dependent , but clathrin ‐ dependent in neu - ronal cells and clathrin ‐ independent in intestinal cells , and leaded to a common early endosomal compartment labeled with EEA1 . Then , HcB was driven into an acidic pathway leading to LE / lysosomes , allowing the translocation of the L chain into the cytosol of neuronal cells , whereas the neurotoxin transcytosed in a Cdc42 ‐ dependent manner and released in an undissociated form at the basolateral side of epithelial intestinal cells .
