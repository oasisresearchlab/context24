Here , we show that the I - BAR - containing IRSp53 protein controls lumen formation and the posi - tioning of the polarity determinants aPKC and podocalyxin . Molecularly , IRSp53 acts by regulating the localization and activity of the small GTPase RAB35 , and by interacting with the actin capping protein EPS8 . Using correlative light and electron microscopy , we further show that IRSp53 ensures the shape and continuity of the opposing plasma membrane of two daughter cells , leading to the formation of a single apical lumen . Genetic removal of IRSp53 results in abnormal renal tubulogenesis , with altered tubular polarity and architectural organization . Thus , IRSp53 acts as a membrane curvature - sensing platform for the assembly of multi - protein complexes that control the traf ﬁ cking of apical determinants and the integrity of the luminal plasma membrane . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17091 - x OPEN 1 IFOM , the FIRC Institute of Molecular Oncology , Via Adamello 16 , 20139 Milan , Italy . 2 Department of Health Sciences , Human Pathology Section , University of Palermo School of Medicine , Via del Vespro 129 , 90127 Palermo , Italy . 3 Cogentech , S .

Polarization requires interactions between the signaling complexes and scaffolds that de ﬁ ne cortical domains with membrane - sorting machinery 1 . This architectural organization and the morphogenesis processes that underlie it can be repro - duced by plating cells on pliable matrigel in a matrigel - containing medium that provides the mechanochemical cues for formation of a polarized hollow sphere ( cyst ) . The de - novo apical – basal polarity arises from successive divisions of a single , nonpolarized cyst - forming cell 2 , 3 . The ﬁ rst symmetry - breaking event occurs at the ﬁ rst cell division , when the midbody is formed 4 . Around the midbody , the apical membrane initiation site ( AMIS ) is assem - bled , which establishes the location of the nascent lumen . Assembly of the AMIS is mediated by both microtubules and branched actin ﬁ laments , which promote recruitment and anchoring of vesicles 5 . Transmembrane proteins , such as podo - calyxin ( PODXL ; classical apical marker , also known as GP135 ) and Crumbs3 , are transcytosed from the plasma membrane facing the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) toward the ﬁ rst cell – cell contact site 6 . This occurs via RAB11 - RAB8 endo / exosomes traf - ﬁ cking and through a direct anchoring with RAB35 at the AMIS 6 , 7 . Thus , coordination between actin cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane traf ﬁ cking is essential for the initiation of a polarized central lumen . The molecular players that link the spatially restricted actin dynamics and the polarized delivery of endosomal vesicles remain incompletely understood . What determines the shape of the opposing apical membrane during the initial phase of lumeno - genesis is also not clear . Proteins that can sense and shape the curvature of the plasma membrane at the AMIS and physically link it with the underlying cytoskeleton will be critical here . We postulated that IRSp53 can ful ﬁ ll this function . IRSp53 regulates the interplay between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton during directional migration and invasion of cells 8 – 11 . Accordingly , IRSp53 localizes at the tips of both ﬁ lopodia and lamellipodia 12 . At these sites , IRSp53 senses and promotes membrane curvature through its I - BAR domain , and acts as an effector of either CDC42 or RAC1 GTPases by ensuring the recruitment of a number of actin regulatory proteins 8 , 9 , 13 – 17 . These proteins include the nucleator - promoting WAVE complex , essential for branched polymerization of actin , and the linear actin elongators VASP and mDia1 , which together with EPS8 ( an actin capping and cross - linking protein 18 ) initiate and promote the extension of ﬁ lopodia 8 , 19 , 20 . Through its I - BAR domain , IRSp53 undergoes a phase separation that facilitates protein clustering 21 and the recruitment of Ezrin , a member of the ezrin - radixin - moesin ( ERM ) protein family , that links the actin cortex to the cell membranes 22 . The subsequent binding of activated CDC42 to this cluster leads to inhibition of the weak capping activity of IRSp53 . It further promotes a structural change in IRSp53 that facilitates the interaction of IRSp53 , via its now - liberated SH3 domain , with actin linear elongators and cross - linkers to support the growth of ﬁ lopodia 8 , 23 . IRSp53 has also been involved in the assembly of cell – cell and cell – ECM adhesions downstream of “ polarity - regulating kinase partitioning - defective 1b ” ( PAR1B ) , and in the polarized archi - tectural organization of Madin Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) epithelial cells in vitro 24 , 25 . The molecular pathways and inter - actors IRSp53 uses in these processes and their physiological relevance at the organism level , however , remains poorly understood . Here , we investigated these issues using three - dimensional cultures of renal MDCK and intestinal Caco - 2 cysts , as well as genetically modi ﬁ ed zebra ﬁ sh and mice . Our data indicate that IRSp53 is pivotal for the assembly of the RAB35 – IRSp53 – EPS8 macromolecular complex . We further show that this complex is necessary for correct kidney morphogenesis and lumenogenesis , through its control of polarized transport and the shape of the apical plasma membrane . Results IRSp53 localizes to the apical lumen in vivo and in vitro . To study the physiological role of IRSp53 in epithelial morphogen - esis , we examined its expression ( Supplementary Fig . 1A ) and localization in several epithelial tissues characterized by glandular or tubular structures ( Fig . 1a – d ) . Invariably , IRSp53 localized to the luminal - facing side of the human epithelial cells in human ( Fig . 1a , b ) , adult mice ( Fig . 1c ) , and in the pronephric ducts of developing zebra ﬁ sh ( Fig . 1d ) . We con ﬁ rm the apical localization of endogenous IRSp53 , as well as of expressed GFP - IRSp53 in two - dimensional ( 2D ) monolayers and 3D cysts of MDCK ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2A ) and colorectal adenocarci - noma ( Caco - 2 ) epithelial ( Supplementary Fig . 2B – C ) cells in vitro . The loss of IRSp53 disrupts cyst morphogenesis . To determine whether IRSp53 is involved in the establishment of apical – basal polarity and lumen formation , IRSp53 was depleted in MDCK cells using CRISPR / Cas9 , shRNA 24 , and siRNAs , and in Caco - 2 cells using CRISPR / Cas9 . Single MDCK - control and IRSp53 - depleted cells were seeded onto Matrigel for 6 days to allow the generation of hollow cysts 1 , 26 . As expected , most of the control cysts ( > 75 % ) developed a single , actin - positive central lumen that was surrounded by an epithelial monolayer , which was decorated by apical proteins , such as PODXL ( Fig . 2b ) . Conversely , < 50 % of the MDCK IRSp53 - silenced cysts formed a single apical lumen , while the remaining showed either multiple or aberrant lumens ( Fig . 2b ) . A signi ﬁ cant increase in multi - luminal aberrant cysts was also seen in two independently generated Caco - 2 cell CRISPR – IRSp53 - KO clones , as compared to the control Caco - 2 cells ( Fig . 2c ) . The aberrant multi - luminal phenotype was rescued upon re - expression of GFP - IRSp53 in both the IRSp53 - silenced MDCK and Caco - 2 IRSp53 - KO cells ( Fig . 2c ) . Thus , IRSp53 has a crucial role in the morphogenesis of these epithelial organoids . IRSp53 controls the distribution and traf ﬁ cking of PODXL . Next , we examined the localization and dynamics of IRSp53 in the very early phases of cystogenesis ( Fig . 3a ) 6 . In the ﬁ rst 8 – 12 h after plating of the control cells , PODXL localized to the per - ipheral surface of the cells , before accumulating in vesicular - like , recycling structures , as previously shown 7 , 27 – 31 . Subsequently , PODXL was delivered to the opposing membrane between the two daughter cells , where the apical lumen was formed de novo ( Fig . 3a , b ) . IRSp53 became prominently enriched along the newly formed , opposing intercellular membrane well before PODXL recruitment ( Fig . 3b , Supplementary Movie 1 ) . At later stages , IRSp53 and PODXL were concentrated at the AMIS , and when the cyst was formed , IRSp53 and PODXL co - stained along the lumen ( Fig . 3b ) . In the early phases of cystogenesis , IRSp53 and PODXL also co - localized in vesicle - like structures ( Fig . 3b ) , which , after forming at the peripheral plasma membrane , were subsequently internalized and targeted to the AMIS and the nascent lumen ( Fig . 3c – d , Supplementary Movies 2 and 3 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that IRSp53 and PODXL co - traf ﬁ c to or from endosomal recycling compartments and that IRSp53 controls the traf ﬁ cking or targeting of PODXL to the AMIS . To distinguish among these possibilities , we analyze the cellular localization of GFP - IRSp53 relative to a variety of proteins that mark distinct traf ﬁ cking compartments .

These structures were also positive for RAB7 , RAB11a , and RAB35 ( Fig . 4a ) , but not for the early and late endosome markers “ early endosome antigen 1 ” ( EEA1 ) and “ lysosome - associated membrane glycoprotein 1 ” ( LAMP1 ) , respectively , or the Golgi marker Giantin ( Supplementary Fig . S2D ) . To determine whether IRSp53 is involved in the control of PODXL traf ﬁ cking , we took advantage of the observation that PODXL is internalized from the apical membrane and undergoes b c d a b2a WT PD Kidney Colon Gastric mucosa Breast b2a – / – PD b2a WT b2b _ Mo PD b2a – / – b2b _ Mo PD Dapi / IRSp53 / Laminin Dapi / IRSp53 / ZO - 1 IRSp53 IRSp53 Laminin ZO - 1 Colon Prostate Salivary gland Breast Gastric mucosa Kidney NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17091 - x ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3516 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17091 - x | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 3 traf ﬁ cking to the so - called vacuolar apical compartment ( VAC ) upon calcium removal in MDCK polarized monolayers 32 . To verify that PODXL is internalized under these conditions , MDCK cell monolayers were incubated with a PODXL antibody that recognized the extracellular portion of PODXL in vivo . Detection of PODXL with a secondary ﬂ uorescence - conjugated anti - PODXL IgG after stripping of the cell surface with acid washes revealed that PODXL was internalized in the VACs ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 3A ) . Of note , IRSp53 and PODXL colocalize at VACs upon calcium removal in polarized monolayer ( Supplementary Fig . 3B ) . The removal of IRSp53 signi ﬁ cantly delayed the relocalization of PODXL to the VACs , in comparison to the control cells ( Supplementary Fig . S3C – E ) . If IRSp53 is required for correct traf ﬁ cking or anchoring of PODXL in the early phases of cystogenesis , its ablation should lead to mislocalization of PODXL . Consistently , while in control cells PODXL was enriched in a single , centrally - located luminal spot at the four - cell stage , in the IRSp53 - KO and knocked - down cells , we detected two or more PODXL - positive foci ( Fig . 4b , c ) . Of note , the majority of IRSp53 - silenced , early phase , multi - luminal cysts retained an apically - restricted distribution of PODXL . However , a signi ﬁ cant , albeit small , proportion of the cysts showed an inverted apical – basal polarity that was characterized by mislocalization of PODXL to the outer , ECM - facing , plasma membrane ( Fig . 4b , c ) . We performed a similar experiment also in IRSp53 - KO Caco - 2 cells by monitoring the distribution of aPKC , which is the most commonly - used apical marker in this cell system 26 , 33 , 34 . Likewise in MDCK cells , IRSp53 depletion resulted in formation of aPKC multi - foci at the 3 – 4 - cell stage during cystogenesis , as compared to the control Caco - 2 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4A ) . Collectively , these ﬁ ndings indicate that IRSp53 is implicated in the traf ﬁ cking and / or correct targeting of apical proteins , and speci ﬁ cally of PODXL , to the de - novo forming lumen . IRSp53 coordinates RAB35 and EPS8 pathways in lumen for - mation . The RAB GTPases are key regulators of PODXL trans - cytosis 35 . Among these , we focused our attention on RAB35 . RAB35 is involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis 36 and was recently shown to localize early at the AMIS , where it serves as a physical anchor for the targeting of PODXL in MDCK cell cystogenesis 7 , 35 . Of note , the complete genetic loss of RAB35 was shown to lead to a complete but transient inversion of polarity accompanied by accumulation of PODXL in intracellular vesicles and only subsequently to the formation of multilumen 32 . Con - versely , a partial reduction of its expression caused the formation of multiple lumen 10 . Collectively , these ﬁ ndings indicate that tampering with RAB35 activity impact on cystogenesis , PODXL traf ﬁ cking and establishment of apico - basal polarity . During the initial phases of cyst development , IRSp53 and RAB35 were enriched along the opposing cell – cell membrane prior to the arrival of PODXL ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 4B ) . At the later stages , IRSp53 , RAB35 , and PODXL were concentrated at the AMIS ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Fig . 4B ) . IRSp53 , RAB35 , and PODXL also colocalized in intracellular vesicle - like structures ( Figs . 3b and 4a , and Supplementary Fig . 4B ) . More relevantly , silencing of RAB35 , as previously reported 7 , 35 and partly reproduced by IRSp53 depletion , resulted in the complete inversion of the apical – basal polarity and in the formation of multi - lumen cysts ( Fig . 4c ) . The penetrance of polarity inversion caused by the silencing of IRSp53 ( Fig . 4b ) is almost as robust as in the case of RAB35 loss . This is , however , expected since IRSp53 only partially affects RAB35 localization and activity and further impacts on other independent pathways ( see below ) . Stated differently , the loss of IRSp53 mimics a partial loss of RAB35 function in epithelial polarity . Notably , IRSp53 retained its localization to the AMIS in RAB35 - silenced cells that showed inverted PODXL polarity ( Supplementary Fig . 4C ) . To determine whether IRSp53 and RAB35 interact physically , co - immunoprecipitation experiments were performed . Here , ectopically expressed IRSp53 interacted with RAB35 only upon serum starvation , which suggested that IRSp53 might preferen - tially associate with the inactive GDP - bound form of RAB35 ( Fig . 5a ) . This possibility was veri ﬁ ed using the recombinant puri ﬁ ed dominant - negative RAB35S22N and constitutively active RAB35Q67L mutants of RAB35 , and the recombinant puri ﬁ ed RAB35WT , loaded either with GDP or GTP γ S , in in vitro pull down and overlay assays . Here , IRSp53 bound directly , albeit weakly to RAB35 and , surprisingly , showed higher apparent af ﬁ nity for inactive RAB35S22N or RAB35WT - GDP compared to the RAB35Q67L or RAB35WT - GTP forms respectively ( Supple - mentary Fig . 4D , E ) . Mapping of the interaction surfaces showed that the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 is necessary and suf ﬁ cient for this association with RAB35S22N ( Fig . 5b ) . In addition , an IRSp53 mutant that lacked these critical positively charged residues ( the I - BAR - 4K domain mutant ; IRSp53 I - BAR * : K142E , K143E , K146E , K147E 37 ) did not interact with RAB35S22N under in vitro binding or co - immunoprecipitation conditions ( Fig . 5c , d ) . The direct interaction between IRSp53 and RAB35 suggested that these two proteins might function together in the regulation of PODXL localization during cystogenesis . Thus , perturbation of their association should affect PODXL traf ﬁ cking to the AMIS and lumenogenesis . To test this , we lentivirally transduced IRSp53 mutants in each of its critical domains ( i . e . , I - BAR , CRIB , SH3 , PDZ - binding domains ) 10 into IRSp53 - silenced MDCK cells and IRSp53 - KO Caco - 2 cells and performed cystogenesis assays to examine PODXL and aPKC localization . Expression of the I - BAR - 4K mutant , which retains its structural integrity 37 but does not bind to RAB35 failed in rescuing the localization of PODXL to a single spot at the AMIS in these MDCK cells ( Fig . 5e ) . This mutant was still present on the apical lumen , albeit its localization was more diffuse and less restricted than wild - type ( WT ) IRSp53 ( see also below ) . Similar ﬁ ndings were obtained upon expression of I - BAR - 4K in Caco - 2 IRSp53 - KO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5A ) . Furthermore , in the Caco - 2 IRSp53 - KO cells , analysis of the IRSp53 mutants showed that the I - BAR and SH3 domains were essential for correct IRSp53 localization at the apical lumen ( Fig . 6a ) . Thus , IRSp53 required its functional I - BAR domain for its role in lumen formation in Fig . 1 IRSp53 is restricted to the luminal side in various epithelial tissues of vertebrates . a IHC analysis of IRSp53 expression and localization in the indicated human tissues and organs .

Molecularly , both its binding to negatively curved , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bis phosphate ( Ptdins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - rich membranes ( which is compromised by the mutations inserted 37 ) , and its interactions with RAB35 are likely to account for these ﬁ ndings . Consistently , IRSp53 ablation impaired the localization of RAB35 ( Fig . 6b ) and of RAB35S22N ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 4F ) at the nascent AMIS during the early phases of cystogenesis . Caution should , however , be used in interpreting the ﬁ nding with RAB35S22N since its expression also perturbs the correct formation of a lumen and PODXL anchoring to the AMIS 7 . This notwithstanding , IRSp53 acts as an assembly platform that drives the correct localization of RAB35 , and possibly its activation , at this site . To directly address this , we measured the amount of GTP - loaded RAB35 using immobilized RAB35 - binding domain of RUSC2 38 . The loss of IRSp53 reduced the levels of active RAB35 ( Fig . 6c ) . Altogether , these ﬁ ndings point to a role of IRSp53 in promoting the optimal localization and activity of RAB35 . The structure - function analysis further indicated the require - ment of additional domains of IRSp53 for correct cyst * * * a DAPI / F - actin / IRSp53 DAPI / PODXL IRSp53 Vinculin M DC K C t r K O % m u l t il u m en * * 0 20 40 60 IRSp53 - KO IRSp53 Ctr b c Ctr IRSp53 - KO IRSp53 Vinculin * 0 20 40 60 # 3 # 12 Ctr # 3 # 12 % m u l t il u m en * * # 3 GFP - IRSp53 * # 3 GFP * * * * * DAPI / F - actin / GFP ( - IRSp53 ) # 12 IRSp53 - KO # 3 Ctr # 3 GFP GFP - IRSp53 * * * * * * * * * IRSp53 - KO IRSp53 - KO % m u l t il u m en IRSp53 Vinculin Ctr KO Ctr KD 0 20 40 60 C t r K D IRSp53 * * * DAPI / F - actin / aPKC 50 100 50 100 50 100 F - actin IRSp53 F - actin F - actin GFP GFP - IRSp53 F - actin F - actin F - actin aPKC aPKC aPKC IRSp53 Ctr vs KO MDCK Ctr vs KD 80 80 KDa KDa KDa NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17091 - x ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3516 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17091 - x | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 morphogenesis . Indeed , IRSp53 mutations in either the CRIB - PP region ( required for IRSp53 binding to active CDC42 8 , 9 , 16 , 23 ) or the SH3 domain ( which mediates interactions with a variety of IRSp53 binding partners 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 20 , 23 , 39 ) failed to rescue the defective distribution of PODXL in MDCK cells and lumen formation in Caco - 2 cells , respectively , that arose from the IRSp53 ablation ( Fig . 5e and Supplementary Fig . 5A ) . Noticeably , impairing the function of the SH3 domain also altered the luminal localization of IRSp53 ( Fig . 6a ) . This was particularly evident in the Caco - 2 cysts . In this system , IRSp53 showed a restricted , although evenly distributed , localization along the apical , luminal side . Conversely , an IRSp53 - SH3 - defective mutant focally accumulated to tight junctions , where it colocalized with ZO - 1 , with its continuous apical distribution lost ( Fig . 6a ) . These results indicate that beside the I - BAR interaction with RAB35 , SH3 interactors are also likely to be important in coordination of IRSp53 localization and activity . Among these , the actin capping and bundling protein EPS8 was previously shown to form a stoichiometrically stable complex with IRSp53 in vivo 9 . Thus , we investigated the involvement of EPS8 together with IRSp53 in orchestration of the correct lumenogenesis program . Here , we show that : ( a ) EPS8 , like IRSp53 , is recruited early at the AMIS ( Supplementary Fig . 5B ) and has an apically restricted luminal localization in MDCK cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5C ) and Caco - 2 cysts ( Supplementary Fig 5D ) ; ( b ) loss of EPS8 in Caco - 2 cells leads to the formation of cysts with multiple lumens and , at less extent , inverted of polarity ( Supplementary Fig . 6A , B ) ; ( c ) EPS8 is required for the correct localization of IRSp53 but not the opposite ( Fig . 6d and Supplementary Fig . 6D ) . IRSp53 shapes the plasma membrane at nascent lumens . Our ﬁ ndings argue that IRSp53 controls epithelial tissue polarity and lumenogenesis in vitro through the regulation of polarized traf - ﬁ cking and by acting as a scaffold for the assembly of apically restricted RAB35 and EPS8 complexes ( Fig . 6e ) . However , IRSp53 can also sense and control membrane curvature and local phos - pholipid composition through its I - BAR domain , which will ultimately impact on the ultrastructural organization and shape of the plasma membrane at the nascent AMIS . To investigate this possibility , we performed correlative light and electron micro - scopy analysis in the very early phases of cystogenesis , which was monitored by the appearance at the AMIS of β - catenin and , more importantly , of PODXL ( Fig . 7a , Supplementary Figs . 7 and 8 ) . We focused on the two - cell stage of MDCK cells plated onto a Matrigel cushion . Comparison between the MDCK control ( Ctr ) and the IRSp53 - KO cells showed that loss of IRSp53 delays or blocks the elimination of cytoplasmic bridges between newly formed apical domains at the AMIS ( Fig . 7a , b ) where IRSp53 is relocalized even before PODXL ( Fig . 2b , Supplementary Fig . 4B and Fig . 7 ) . Also , albeit less frequently , this impacted on the intercellular luminal space ( Fig . 7a ) , and resulted in the formation of PODXL - positive ectopic lumens ( cytoplasmic membrane vacuoles with features of apical domains ) ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Of particular signi ﬁ cance , there was the occasional but evident reduction of intercellular space and a signi ﬁ cant increase in the number of “ cytoplasmic bridges ” that interrupted the separation of the luminal ( apical ) plasma membrane of two adjacent IRSp53 - KO cells ( Fig . 7a , b ) . These were also visible in tomographic 3D reconstructions ( Fig . 7B ; Supplementary Movie 4 ) . Thus , IRSp53 ensures the integrity and structural organization of the plasma membrane at the AMIS . The increased number of membrane interconnections , caused by the loss of IRSp53 might generate distinct “ mini - lumens ” and plasma membrane targeting sites . These defects together with altered polarized traf ﬁ cking of PODXL carriers , also enriched in IRSp53 ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , might lead the accumulation of PODXL in multiple foci , which would eventually evolve into multiple lumens . IRSp53 is required for kidney development and morphology . To determine the functional activity of IRSp53 is physiologically relevant in living organisms , zebra ﬁ sh lines were generated that carry a mutation in the ﬁ sh paralog , baiap2a ( b2a ) , and mor - pholinos were used to ablate baiap2b ( b2b ) ( see below ) . More - over , we analyzed tissue organization in IRSp53 - KO mice . In both of these models , IRSp53 showed prominent expression and peculiar luminal localization in the kidneys . In the renal tubules of adult mice , IRSp53 was expressed and enriched at the luminal side ( Fig . 1c ) . A similar , restricted pattern of luminal apical expression was seen in early - stage pronephric ducts in developing ﬁ sh embryos ( Fig . 1d ) . The analysis was therefore focused on this organ , and speci ﬁ cally on its tubular architecture . In zebra ﬁ sh , gene duplication resulted in the generation of two distinct , but highly related , IRSp53 paralogs known as baiap2a ( b2a ) and baiap2b ( b2b ) . These two gene products are expressed at variable levels in the developing embryo , with b2a as the more expressed ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) . A mutant zebra ﬁ sh line was generated in which the gene product encoding for b2a was disrupted through introduction of a chemically - mediated nonsense muta - tion ( Supplementary Fig . 1C ) , with that for b2b targeted using a mixture of splice and translation blocking morpholinos ( Sup - plementary Fig . 1C ) . We also characterized an antibody that can recognize both b2a and b2b , at least when expressed in mam - malian cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1D ) . The loss of b2a in the mutant line caused a large reduction in the expression of IRSp53 in the pronephric ducts , which was consistent with b2a being Fig . 2 IRSp53 removal increased the formation of cysts with multiple lumens . a Three days old MDCK epithelial cysts were ﬁ xed and stained an anti - IRSp53 antibody ( green ) , and rhodamine phalloidin ( red ) to visualized F - actin and DAPI ( blue ) .

These ducts were less compact and dense ( Supplementary Fig . 9A ) , with irregular or multiple lumens ( Supplementary Fig . 9B ) and frequently ( in ~ 67 % of embryos ) showed the formation of ectopic ClaudinB - positive structures emerging from their basal surfaces ( Fig . 8a , Supplementary Fig . 9B , Supplementary Fig . 10A , and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . The multiple lumens and ectopic pseudo - lumenized structures characterized by irregular and diffused acetylated - tubulin and F - actin distributions ( Supple - mentary Fig . 9B and Supplementary Fig . 10A ) were reminiscent of the defects observed in mammalian organoids devoid of IRSp53 caused by perturbation of the correct polarity program . Despite the absence of an overt phenotypic alteration in the pronephric ducts of singly mutated b2a embryos , we reasoned that in adult life , aging - dependence or environmental stresses might combine with the genetic alterations to cause phenotypic perturbations that are not visible during development . Consis - tently , histological analysis of adult zebra ﬁ sh kidneys at various ages ( e . g . , 4 , 8 months ) showed several morphological defects in the kidneys of the adult b2a mutant line ( Fig . 8b ) . The general architecture of the organs of the b2a mutants was altered , with a decrease in the density of the tubules and a relative increase in the epithelial - to - hematopoietic cell ratio , compared to those of age - matched WT animals ( Fig . 8b ) . This was accompanied by vascular lacunae and defects in the architectural organization of the renal tubules , which were frequently coarsed or lacked an overt lumen ( Fig . 8b ) . Prompted by these observations , we examined the renal architecture in the IRSp53 - KO mice . IRSp53 - KO mice have a partially penetrant mid - gestation lethality that is due to defects in placental morphogenesis , as previously reported 41 . Some 20 % to 25 % of these mice , however , are born fertile and devoid of gross tissue dysmorphology 8 , 42 , 43 . Histopathological and immunohis - tochemical analyses of renal tissues of the IRSP53 - KO mice , however , showed some relatively mild , but evident and recurrent , alterations that were reminiscent of those in the kidneys and tubules of the adult B2a mutant zebra ﬁ sh ( Fig . 9 , Supplementary Fig . 10B ) . The overall morphology of the IRSp53 - KO mouse kidneys was defective , with thinning of the cortex despite preserved glomerular density . The renal proximal tubules showed irregular contours that resulted in ill - de ﬁ ned lumina lined by irregularly spaced epithelial cells with prominent nuclear dysmorphism ( Fig . 9a ) . Similar architectural alterations were seen in the distal tubules . Focal periodic acid Schiff – positive urinary casts were detected in the IRSp53 - KO mouse kidney parenchyma ( Supplementary Fig . 11A ) . In addition , the glomeruli of these IRSp53 - KO mice showed alterations in the capillary tufts , because of multifocal pseudo - aneurismatic vascular dilations and / or mesangial cell proliferation ( Fig . 9a ) . The severity of these phenotypes was scored using a histological alteration score ( Fig . 9b , Supplementary Fig . 10B ) . Immunohistochemistry analysis of both apical and basal epithelial renal markers further highlighted defects in the epithelial tubular cell apical – basal polarity , as shown by the following ﬁ ndings ( Supplementary Fig . 11B – D ) : ( i ) ZO - 1 , which labeled tight apical junctions in most tubules of the control kidney , was diffuse or reduced in IRSp53 - KO kidney tubules ( Supplementary Fig . 11B ) ; ( ii ) similarly , the apical label aPKC ζ was diminished , and was sometimes absent from the lumen of mutant animals ( Supple - mentary Fig . 11C ) ; ( iii ) endomucin , which localizes to the basal side of tubules in the controls , remained largely basal when expressed , but was irregularly distributed and sometimes absent in the IRSp53 - KO tubules ( Supplementary Fig . 11D ) . Altogether these data indicate that IRSp53 loss results in a set of subclinical morphological and histological aberrancies in the developing kidney and in adult renal tubules in zebra ﬁ sh and mice , by impinging on , at least in part , the correct establishment or maintenance of epithelial polarity . Discussion During the development of tubular or glandular structures of epithelial tissues , and speci ﬁ cally of kidneys , de - novo formation of a polarized central lumen is a key step that requires spatio - temporally coordinated interplay between actin cytoskeleton dynamics and targeted exocytosis of apical cargos , such as PODXL 31 . Although the molecular players that coordinate these events have been intensely studied 44 , we still do not have a complete mechanistic understanding of this process . In addition , whether the knowledge gleaned from the analysis of in vitro morphogenesis of multicellular systems , such as cysts derived from MDCK or Caco - 2 cells 1 , 26 , 27 , 45 – 47 , is physiologically rele - vant in vivo for the development of complex organs has not been systematically tested . Here , we show that IRSp53 , a CDC42 effector that can sense Ptdins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich negative membrane curvature 8 , 10 , 23 – 25 , acts as a platform for the assembly , integration , and spatial restriction of multiple complexes that are needed for correct formation of the polarized single lumen in various epithelial systems in vitro . We further show that IRSp53 is critical in the shaping of the plasma membrane , and to ensure its integrity and continuity in the nascent lumen ( Fig . 10 ) . These functional roles in in vitro systems are mirrored by the requirement for IRSp53 for correct mor - phogenesis and structural organization of kidney tubules in mice Fig . 4 Loss of IRSp53 alters PODXL traf ﬁ cking at the AMIS and apical – basal polarity . a Left : MDCK cells , expressing GFP - IRSp53 , were mock transfected or transfected with Apple - RAB11a or RFP - RAB35 , and seeded as single cells on Matrigel and ﬁ xed after 5 h of growth .

Topologically , IRSp53 is apically restricted at the luminal membrane side of tubular and glandular epithelial tissues in human , murine , and zebra ﬁ sh , and in 3D epithelial acini in vitro . This apically restricted localization is particularly prominent in adult murine and human kidney tubules , and in the pronephric ducts of zebra ﬁ sh during development . Depletion of IRSp53 disrupts cystogenesis in vitro , which leads to multi - lumen for - mation and inversion of polarity . A remarkably similar set of alterations , which includes formation of multiple lumens and of ectopic structures that have lost their stereotypical apical – basal morphology , are also observed in the pronephric duct after genetic removal of the two zebra ﬁ sh paralogs of mammalian IRSp53 . Renal tubules in IRSp53 - KO mice are convoluted , not patent , and frequently display an aberrant distribution of the epithelial cells that normally surround the lumen in an orderly and stereotypical pattern . The latter phenotypes correlate with incorrect distribution of various apical determinants , including ZO - 1 and aPKC . Collectively , these ﬁ ndings support the crucial involvement of IRSp53 in renal lumenogenesis and tubule mor - phogenesis across different species . The relatively mild tubular defects in adult organisms appear to re ﬂ ect the plasticity of the epithelial morphogenesis processes , which can use multiple , and often redundant , molecular pathways to ensure maintenance of the correctly organized structure and a b IRSp53 ( 30 nM ) c Input IPs GFPGFP - IRSp53 - WT GFP - IRSp53 - I - BAR * RFP - RAB35S22N + – + + – – – – – G F P RAB35 GFP - IRSp53 + – + + – – – – – + – + + + + + + + + + + + – – – – – GFP 100 nM BSA nM RAB35S22N nM RAB35S22N I - BAR * ( 30 nM ) d 0 10 20 50 0 10 20 50 I - BAR CRIB SH3 W413G Binding + 052 1 + 521 1 – 1 437 + 521 250 X 521 + 1 % o f c e ll s w i t h P O D X L m u l t i f o c i * 0 20 40 60 80 IRSp53KD WT I - BAR * CRIB * SH3 * PDZ * IRSp53 - KD + GFP - IRSp53 DAPI / GFP - IRSp53 / PODXL I - BAR * CRIB * SH3 * PDZ * IRSp53 - KD + GFP - IRSp53 WT IRSp53 - KD DAPI / β - catenin / PODXL * * * * * * * * * IRSp53 GFP Vinculin W T I - B A R * C R I B * S H 3 * P D Z * KD CTR GFP - IRSp53 e Input Vinculin pAKT Flag ( IRSp53 ) GFP ( RAB35 ) Ctr Flag IPs – + – + Growth factors – + Ctr GFP * * 50 50 50 100 75 50 25 110 80 β - catenin GFP - IRSp53 GFP - IRSp53 GFP - IRSp53 GFP - IRSp53 GFP - IRSp53 PODXL PODXL PODXL PODXL PODXL PODXL KDa KDa KDa 60 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17091 - x 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3516 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17091 - x | www . nature . com / naturecommunications the functional activity of the tissues . In keeping with this concept , the genetic loss of another member of the I - BAR family proteins , known as “ missing - in metastasis ” ( MIM , also known as MTSS1 ) , was shown to impact on adult kidney architecture through reg - ulation of intercellular junctions . MIM − / − mice show a pro - gressive kidney pathological diseased state with dilated tubules , glomerular degeneration , and ﬁ brosis . This set of alterations is accompanied by polyuria at the systemic level , whereas increased intercellular junctional spaces are detected by ultrastructural electron microscopy analysis 48 . Thus , different members of the I - BAR family proteins contribute to the proper structural organi - zation of adult murine kidney , with these partly acting in a redundant fashion 48 . It is also of note that some of the alterations due to loss of IRSp53 are observed in mice devoid of key com - ponents of the molecular network of the IRSp53 interactors . A case in point is CDC42 , which has a pivotal role in virtually all polarized cell processes in diverse epithelial and non - epithelial tissues by acting as a central signaling hub that connects actin dynamics , vesicular traf ﬁ cking , and membrane remodeling 1 , 49 . Indeed , genetic loss of CDC42 in murine kidney tubules during development leads to abnormal tubulogenesis with profound defects in polarity , lumen formation , and the actin cytoskeleton , which eventually result in premature death of these animals 50 – 52 . These alterations are signi ﬁ cantly more severe than those detected in IRSp53 - KO mice , which is in keeping with the concept that CDC42 is a central hub that coordinates and uses multiple effectors and pathways to control polarity . Among these , IRSp53 appears to contribute to interconnecting of the CDC42 axis with RAB35 / PODXL traf ﬁ cking and EPS8 - based actin dynamics . However , other CDC42 - dependent pathways , such as Ptdins ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - Annexin - CDC42 53 , CDC42 - PAR3 - aPKC 54 , and CDC42 / YAP1 52 are expected to remain functional following disruption of IRSp53 , and might , therefore , compensate for the lack of IRSp53 . Redundancy and compensation mechanisms of IRSp53 func - tions might also be at play in processes and pathways that control endocytic internalization of PODXL , inversion of polarity and Robo2 - p53 axis , which , as described in the Supplementary dis - cussion , have been implicated in the correct lumenogenesis and renal tubule formation . At the cellular level , during 3D cystogenesis , the loss of IRSp53 leads to formation of multiple lumens and reversal of polarity , albeit less frequently . The formation of multiple lumens occurs frequently following disruption of a variety of traf ﬁ cking , polarity , and cytokinetic regulators . This indicates that none of these processes is essential for establishment of apical – basal epithelial polarity ; rather , they all contribute to ensure the formation of the single AMIS that will eventually generate a single lumen . In the case of IRSp53 , its loss is likely to impact on the optimal func - tionality of many of these critical cell - biology processes . Indeed , IRSp53 is recruited very early on , at the onset of AMIS formation , which appears to be as a consequence of its I - BAR domain sen - sing of Ptdins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich , negative membrane curvature that is a distinguishing early feature during de - novo formation of the AMIS around the midbody immediately after completion of the ﬁ rst cytokinesis 5 , 53 . At this site , and similar to what is seen in extending protrusions of migratory cells 12 , 55 – 59 , IRSp53 accu - mulates together with its interactor , the actin capping protein EPS8 . This protein is expected to regulate not only local cortical actin dynamics , but also to maintain IRSp53 in an “ open con - formation ” , opposing the inhibitory actions of 14 - 3 - 3 23 , 60 . This might facilitate the association of IRSp53 with Ptdins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membranes , and also with activated CDC42 and inactive RAB35 . In keeping with this concept , removal of EPS8 not only pheno - copies the loss of IRSp53 in cystogenesis assays , but also results in redistribution of IRSp53 , which loses its continuous apical pat - tern , and becomes concentrated at tight junctions in association with ZO - 1 . The importance of the interaction between IRSp53 and activated CDC42 is underscored by the observation that a single - point mutation in the CDC42 binding site of IRSp53 fails to rescue the phenotype in IRSp53 - KO MDCK and Caco - 2 cells . In addition , in vitro , IRSp53 loss mimics the removal of CDC42 26 , 61 , 62 , which leads to the formation of multiple lumens . Of note , the loss of CDC42 also disrupts the orientation of the spindle in dividing cells during cystogenesis 26 , 61 , 62 and controls the traf ﬁ cking of polarized determinants . Both of these altered processes are thought to be responsible for the aberrant formation of multiple lumens . Within this context , IRSp53 , which directly binds to CDC42 , might mediate some of these speci ﬁ c functions . Consistent with this , traf ﬁ cking of PODXL was perturbed and IRSp53 localized to PODXL - positive recycling endosomes . Fur - ther , the loss of IRSp53 signi ﬁ cantly altered the spindle orienta - tion during Caco - 2 cystogenesis , to an extent and in a fashion not dissimilar from those seen after the loss of CDC42 ( data not shown ) . While the precise mechanisms through which IRSp53 applies this multiple - level regulation remains to be de ﬁ ned , the most parsimonious interpretation of our ﬁ ndings is that IRSp53 acts as an important CDC42 effector , during both spindle orientation and polarized membrane traf ﬁ cking . In addition to this role , the localization of IRSp53 at the AMIS and its interaction with RAB35 suggests that it is also part of a set of molecular cues that de ﬁ ne the identity of , and ensure the structural integrity of , the future apical membrane .

In this latter respect , it is worth noting that : ( i ) as for the loss of RAB35 that was recently demonstrated to function as a PODXL tethering factor at the AMIS 7 , also the loss of IRSp53 disrupts the correct apical distribution of PODXL ; ( ii ) the binding to RAB35 and Ptdins ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - rich membrane is mediated by the I - BAR domain . In addition , a mutant in the key positively charged patches of this domain that disrupts the interaction of IRSp53 with Ptdins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich lipid bilayers 37 as well as the binding to RAB35 failed to correctly localize apically and to rescue the multi - lumen phenotype in the IRSp53 - KO cysts ; ( iii ) IRSp53 ablation impairs RAB35 localization at the nascent AMIS , which demonstrates that IRSp53 drives the correct loca - lization of RAB35 . An equally plausible , although not mutually exclusive , possibility is that in addition to binding to inactive RAB35 along the AMIS , IRSp53 might associate with regulators of the RAB35 GTPase , including GEFs or GAPs , to thus con - tribute to the regulation of its activity . Our proteomic studies using IRSp53 – BirA approaches that can detect transient inter - actions 64 , however , failed to identify any of these proteins { deposited at PASS01464 , for details see Methods } , which would argue against this mode of action .

Thus , the involvement in membrane traf ﬁ cking appears to be a more general emerging function of the I - BAR family proteins . Ultimately , the multiple functional roles of IRSp53 are likely to be integrated with its sensing and shaping of the ﬂ at plasma membrane at the nascent lumen via its I - BAR domain . Here , IRSp53 appears to be crucial in the control of the integrity , continuity , and shape of the opposing plasma membrane . Indeed , its loss leads to the formation ( or preservation ) of bridges between the apical domains of the plasma membrane , which interrupt the continuity of the nascent lumen ( Fig . 10 ) . It appears reasonable to propose that it is exactly this structural , membrane role in combination with its control of the traf ﬁ cking of key polarity determinants that accounts for its involvement in lumen formation and tubule morphology . Whatever the case , all in all , our ﬁ ndings are consistent with a multifaceted role for IRSp53 that is crucial to ensure the struc - tural integrity and shape of the plasma membrane , and to coor - dinate the traf ﬁ cking of apical proteins to the AMIS . They further support the concept that IRSp53 acts as a platform where traf - ﬁ cking determinants ( e . g . , RAB35 ) , actin regulatory proteins ( e . g . , EPS8 ) , and the small GTPase that is critical for polarity ( i . e . , CDC42 ) are assembled for the correct coordination of diverse processes during tubule morphogenesis and the establishment of renal tubular architecture in different species .

Cells were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraf - ormaldehyde for 10 ′ , washed with PBS and permeabilized in PBS 0 , 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10min at room temperature ( RT ) . To prevent non - speci ﬁ c binding of the anti - bodies , cells were then incubated with PBS in the presence of 1 % BSA for 10min . The coverslips were then gently deposited , face down , on 50µl of primary antibody diluted in PBS 1 % BSA , spotted on Para ﬁ lm . After 40min of incubation at RT , coverslips were transferred into 12 well plates and washed three times with PBS . Cells were then incubated for 40min at RT with the appropriate secondary antibody . F - actin was detected by staining with FITC or TRITC - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) at a concentration of 6 . 7U / mL . After three washes in PBS , coverslips were transferred into 12 well plates and incubated in PBS containing DAPI ( 1 : 3000 ) for 5min at RT .

Control MDCK cells plated on Matrigel in Matrigel - containing media undergo symmetry - breaking events immediately after the ﬁ rst cell division , when after cytokinetic furrow ingression a midbody is formed 4 . Around the midbody , the apical membrane initiation site ( AMIS ) is assembled establishing the location of the nascent lumen . AMIS assembly requires the polarized transport of highly - charged and - glycosylated transmembrane proteins , such as Podocalyxin ( PODXL ) , that from the outer cell face become endocytosed and traf ﬁ c via vesicular recycling carriers to the newly formed opposing plasma membrane . At this site , repulsive charges contribute to generate interconnected mini - lumens ( leftmost inset show a Correlative Light Electron Microscopy - CLEM - analysis of MDCK cells capture after the very ﬁ rst cell division ) that will evolve to form a single apical lumen , typical of an epithelial cyst . IRSp53 is required both for directing the traf ﬁ cking of PODXL and to ensure its targeting at the AMIS via stabilizing the GTPase RAB35 ( not shown ) , and through its interaction with the actin capping protein Eps8 ( not shown ) . At the AMIS , IRSp53 through its membrane deforming and curvature sensing I - BAR domain ensures the structural integrity , continuity and correct shape of the opposing plasma membrane at two - cells stage . Consistent with this , IRSp53 genetic loss leads to interruption of the continuity of the PM at the AMIS ( top rightmost inset , yellow arrowhead indicate membrane discontinuities ) , with the formation of inter - cytoplasmic bridges , and occasionally ectopic lateral lumen ( bottom inset , magenta line outlines the intervening PM and the extra lumen ) .

The system is driven by the Olympus CellSens Dimension 1 . 18 software ( Build 16686 ) . The experiments were performed using an environ - mental microscope incubator ( OKOLab ) set to 37 °C and 5 % CO2 perfusion . Correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) . MDCK cells were trypsinized to a single cell suspension at 4 × 10 4 cells / ml in complete medium containing 2 % Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) . Cell - medium - Matrigel suspensions ( 350µl ) were plated into 35mm dish with gridded coverslips ( MatTek Corporation , P35G - 1 . 5 - 14 - CGRD ) , pre - coated with 20µl of Matrigel ( 10mg / ml ) . 2 % Matrigel complete medium was added to 2ml . After 16 – 18h cells were ﬁ xed with 150mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 4 % PFA , 0 . 05 % Glutaraldehyde ( 5min RT ) and 150mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 , 4 % PFA ( 10min RT — 3 times ) . Cells were then washed with PBS 1× ( 5min RT — 3 times ) , blocked and permeabilized in PBS 1× , 1 % BSA , 0 . 1 % Saponin ( 1h 30min RT ) . Primary antibody was then added in PBS 1× , 1 % BSA , 0 . 1 % Saponin ( 4h RT ) . After 3 washes in PBS 1X cells were incubated with secondary antibody ( + Dapi ) in PBS 1× , 1 % BSA , 0 . 1 % Saponin ( 2h RT ) then washed in PBS 1× ( 3 times ) and kept in PBS . Samples were analyzed with SP8 confocal microscope ( 20X dry 0 . 55 NA objective ) to identify cells of interests on the gridded coverslips . After selection samples were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 2 , 5 % glutaraldehyde ( EMS , USA ) mixture in 0 . 2M Sodium Cacodylate pH 7 . 2 for 2 h at RT , followed by 6 washes in 0 . 2M Sodium Cacodylate pH 7 . 2 at RT . Then cells were incubated in 1 : 1 mixture ( volume : volume ) of 2 % osmium tetra oxide and 3 % potassium ferrocyanide ( ﬁ nal concentration 1 % osmium tetra oxide and 1 . 5 % potassium ferrocyanide ) for 1h at RT followed by 6 times rinsing in 0 . 2M Sodium Cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) . Then the samples were sequentially treated with 0 . 3 % Thiocarbohydrazide in 0 . 2 M Sodium Cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 2 ) for 10 min and 1 % OsO4 in 0 . 2M Sodium Cacodylate buffer ( pH 6 , 9 ) for 30 min . Samples were rinsed with 0 . 1M Sodium Cacodylate ( pH 6 . 9 ) buffer until all traces of the yellow osmium ﬁ xative have been removed , washed in de - ionized water , treated with 1 % uranyl acetate in water for 1h and washed in water again 68 . The samples were subsequently subjected to de - hydration in ethanol , and embedded in Epoxy resin at RT and polymerized for at least 72 h in a 60 °C oven . Immunolabeling with gold particles : Samples , analyzed with SP8 confocal microscope ( 20X dry 0 . 55 NA objective ) to identify cells of interests on the gridded coverslips ( as described above ) , were ﬁ xed with a mixture of 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 15 M Hepes for 5min at RT and then replaced with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0 . 15M Hepes for 30min . Afterward , the cells were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with blocking solution ( 0 , 5 % BSA , 0 , 1 % saponin , 0 , 27g NH4Cl in 0 . 2M HEPES pH 7 . 2 ) for 30 min at RT . Then cells were incubated with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C . On the following day , the cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with goat anti - rabbit or anti - mouse Fab ’ fragments coupled to 1 . 4 nm gold particles ( diluted in blocking solution 1 : 100 ) for 2h and washed 6 times with PBS . Meanwhile , the activated GoldEnhanceTM - EM ( Nanoprobes , Yaphank NY , USA ) was prepared according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions and 100 μ l were added into each sample well . The reaction was monitored by a conventional light microscope and was stopped after 5 - 10min when the cells had turned “ dark enough ” by washing several times with PBS . Then cells were ﬁ xed , stained and processed as above . Sectioning : In order to get EM images of the cell of interest , cells were grown in three - dimensional Matrigel ( collagen ) matrix , which was prepared in such a way to get the minimal thickness of the matrix layer ( ~ 100 μ m ) . The cells at the early stages of cystogenesis , as judged by the initial recruitment of PODXL at the AMIS , were selected during the analysis of the MatTek dish ; the optical sectioning and the Z - stacking were then performed using confocal microscope . During Z - stacking the distance between the bottom and the surface of the cell was estimated to facilitate the trimming of the sample after its embedding into Epon , to ﬁ nd our pair quickly and to economize slot grids . Z - stack images were printed and during trimming of the pyramid and its sharpening these images were constantly used . Embedded samples were then sectioned with diamond knife ( Diatome , Switzerland ) using Leica EM UC7 ultra microtome . In order to start sectioning exactly when the surface of sectioning reached the cell surface , we used display of the ultramicrotome section counter , which shows the total advance and the total number of sections cut from the moment of CLEAR setting . For the trimming and advance to ROI we used the Diatome diamond trimming blades ( trimtool 45 , and histo ) ( Diatome , Switzerland ) . In order to avoid mistakes we took into consideration the possible “ shrinkage ” of the matrix during its dehydration and embedding into Epon . Thus , when only 3 μ m were left before the beginning of the cell surface we replaced the trimming histo - knife with the Ultra 35 knife ( Diatome , Switzerland ) , and then cut two 200 - nm sections and then a small series of 70nm sections . This series then was interrupted by two 200 - nm sections and then the same alternating procedure was repeated several times until the moment when according to our estimation of the deepness of the cell , the cell should be ﬁ nished . Sections were analyzed with a Tecnai 20 High Voltage EM ( FEI , now Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ; The Netherlands ) operating at 200kV . Tilt series were recorded at a magni ﬁ cation of 9600× , 11 , 500× , 14 , 500× , 19 , 000× , or 25 , 000× using software supplied with the instrument . Immune - CLEM : We followed the protocols described in ref . 69 . Brie ﬂ y , an ultramicrotome ( Leica EM UC7 ; Leica Microsystems , Vienna ) was used to cut 60 nm serial thin sections and 200 nm serial semi - thick sections . Sections were collected onto 1 % Formvar ﬁ lms adhered to slot grids . Both sides of the grids were labeled with ﬁ duciary 10 nm gold ( PAG10 , CMC , Utrecht , the Netherlands ) . Tilt - series were collected from the samples from ±65° with 1° increments at 200 kV in Tecnai 20 electron microscopes ( FEI , now Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Eindhoven , the Netherlands ) and recorded at a magni ﬁ cation of 9600× , 11 , 500× , 14 , 500× , 19 , 000× or 25 , 000× using software supplied with the instrument . The nominal resolution in our tomograms was 4nm , based upon section thickness , the number of tilts , tilt increments , and tilt angle range . The IMOD package and its newest viewer , 3DMOD 4 . 0 . 11 , were used to construct individual tomograms and for the assignment of the outer lea ﬂ et of organelle membrane contours , CLEM was performed as described 70 . Immunohistochemistry . Mouse tissues and organs were dissected just after the mice were sacri ﬁ ced by CO 2 asphyxiation or cervical dislocation .
