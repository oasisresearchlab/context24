Here we show that the formins Bni1 and Bnr1 of budding yeast stimulate the assembly of actin filaments that function as precursors to tropomyosin - stabilized cables that direct polarized cell growth . With loss of formin function , cables disassemble , whereas increased formin activity causes the hyperaccumulation of cable - like filaments . Unlike the assembly of cortical actin patches , cable assembly requires profilin but not the Arp2 / 3 complex . Thus formins control a distinct pathway for assembling actin filaments that organize the overall polarity of the cell . T he ability of cells to polarize is essential for such processes as cell division , assembly of epithelia , neuronal outgrowth and cellular locomotion 1 . To establish polarity , eukaryotic cells interpret extrinsic and intrinsic cues to assemble a polarized cytoskeleton which , in turn , organizes internal membranes . During vegetative growth in budding yeast , these processes are regulated by Rho - GTPases in pathways that bear a striking resemblance to those in vertebrates 2 . One aspect of yeast that simplifies analysis is that the actin cytoskeleton is solely responsible for polarizing cell growth , the distribution of specific mRNAs and organelle inheri - tance , whereas microtubules direct chromosome separation and cooperate with actin to orient the mitotic spindle . The yeast F - actin cytoskeleton consists of two main types of structure . Cortical patches are small foci of actin filaments and associated proteins that are associated with the plasma membrane and cluster near regions of growth 3 , 4 . They seem to be principally involved in endocytosis in a process conserved in mammalian cells 5 , 6 . Actin cables are bundles of filaments that arise from discrete regions of the plasma membrane coincident with growth sites , and extend throughout the cell 3 , 4 . Cables are highly dynamic essential structures that guide the polarized movements of two types of myosin V — Myo2 and Myo4 ( ref . 5 ) . Myo2 delivers secretory vesi - cles to sites of polarized growth 7 , 8 , directs segregation of vacuole 9 and late - Golgi components 10 , and delivers Kar9 ( ref . 11 ) , a cortical anchor that orients the mitotic spindle 12 , into the bud . Myo4 deliv - ers specific mRNAs into the bud 13 . How does yeast regulate the spatial and temporal assembly of each cytoskeletal component ? Cortical - patch assembly is mediated by a highly conserved process regulated by Rho - GTPases 14 and involving a WASp / Scar homologue ( Bee1 / Las17 ) , a WIP homo - logue ( Vrp1 ) and two type I myosins ( Myo3 and Myo5 ) , which together activate the Arp2 / 3 complex for F - actin assembly 15 – 18 . Organization of actin cables is also expected to be Rho - GTPase - dependent . The yeast formin homologues Bni1 and Bnr1 are Rho - GTPase targets 19 – 21 that are candidates for controlling cable dynam - ics . Bni1 in particular is a likely candidate as it localizes to sites of polarized growth 19 , 22 , 23 , and bni1 mutant cells display actin - cable - associated defects in localization of polarized mRNAs 13 , spindle orientation 24 , 25 and apical growth 19 , 23 , 26 . Formins are conserved from yeast to mammals , and contribute to F - actin assembly and reorganization during polarized growth , cytokinesis and stress fibre assembly 27 – 29 . They share conserved domains ( Fig . 1a ) , suggesting common modes of regulation and function , including a Rho - bind - ing domain ( RBD ) and three formin - homology domains ( FH1 , FH2 and FH3 ) . The proline - rich FH1 domain binds to profilin as well as to peptide - recognition modules such as SH3 and WW domains 27 – 29 . The FH2 domain is the largest and best - conserved region , but its function is unclear . FH3 directs the proper localiza - tion of yeast formins 30 . From studies of the mammalian formin mDia1 , the RBD confers Rho - GTPase - dependent activity through intramolecular association with a portion of the FH2 — the Dia - autoregulatory - domain ( DAD ) 31 — a region that is homolo - gous in Bni1 ( residues 1 , 794 – 1 , 824 ) and Bnr1 ( residues 1 , 309 – 1 , 335 ) . This association inhibits formin activity , but is relieved by binding of GTP - Rho with the RBD , similarly to the GTP - Cdc42 - dependent activation of WASp 32 . Here we analyse the functions of Bni1 and Bnr1 in yeast and find that either is essential for the assembly of polarized actin cables . Our results suggest that yeast has two distinct F - actin - assembly complexes : one that uses the Arp2 / 3 complex assembles the cortical patches involved in endocytosis ; a second regulated by formins assembles tropomyosin - containing actin cables that guide the overall polarity of the cell . Results FH2 mutations result in conditional bni1 alleles . Although neither Bni1 or Bnr1 is essential , loss of both formins is lethal 23 , 33 . To assess the terminal phenotype of yeast lacking formin function , we muta - genized a region encompassing the FH1 and FH2 domains of BNI1 and used the plasmid - shuffle procedure to isolate temperature - sen - sitive bni1 alleles ( bni1 - ts ) . Seven bni1 alleles rescued the lethality of © 2002 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 JANUARY 2002 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 33 bni1 ∆ bnr1 ∆ cells at the permissive temperature of 18 ° C but failed to do so at 35 ° C ( Fig . 1b ) . All alleles contained mutations between residues 1 , 441 and 1 , 718 , a region within the FH2 domain , as fol - lows : bni1 - 11 ( D1511G , K1601R ) , bni1 - 12 ( S1623G ) , bni1 - 13 ( S1562P ) , bni1 - 14 ( R1530G , L1610P ) , bni1 - 15 ( L1559P ) , bni1 - 16 ( V1441A , N1647S , S1562P ) , and bni1 - 17 ( F1455L , E1718L ) . These alleles were integrated into the chromosomal BNI1 locus of bnr1 ∆ cells for analysis , and the phenotypes of two particular alleles , bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ and bni1 - 12 bnr1 ∆ , were examined in detail . Formins are required for actin cable assembly . Simultaneous par - tial disruption of BNI1 and BNR1 is known to depolarize the actin cytoskeleton and cell growth 21 . We examined the short - term effects of the loss of formin function on the actin cytoskeleton in the bni1 - ts bnr1 ∆ mutants . Tropomyosins ( Tpm1 and Tpm2 ) are F - actin - binding proteins that associate specifically with actin cables in yeast 34 , 35 , whereas actin ( Act1 ) is the major component of both cortical patches and cables 3 . Anti - Act1 and anti - Tpm1 immunofluorescence staining and rhodamine – phalloidin stain - ing of F - actin showed that wild - type cells , bni1 ∆ cells , bnr1 ∆ cells and bni1 - ts bnr1 ∆ cells grown at 18 ° C all displayed prominent cortical patches in the bud , and actin cables that extended along the surface of the bud and into the mother cell ( Fig . 2a , b ) . When bni1 - ts bnr1 ∆ mutant strains were shifted to 35 ° C , cortical patch - es remained but actin cables disappeared ( Fig . 2b ) . Cable disas - sembly was rapid , occurring within 2 min in bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ and bni1 - 12 bnr1 ∆ cells at all stages of the cell cycle ( Fig . 2c ) , and was irreversible in bni1 - 12 bnr1 ∆ cells ( data not shown ) , but reversible in bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ mutant cells , with cables reassembling within 5 min recovery at 18 ° C ( Fig . 2b ) . This suggests that the bni1 - 11 mutation did not cause degradation of Bni1 - 11 at 35 ° C , but that the FH2 region might be critical to actin - cable stability . Cortical actin patches persisted in all bni1 - ts bnr1 ∆ mutants and gradually depolarized over the cell surface after extended periods at 35 ° C ( Fig . 2b , d ) , which is probably a secondary effect of the loss of actin cables 35 . Knowing that the steady - state maintenance of actin cables requires formins , we wished to investigate whether formins are also required for rapidly induced assembly of actin cables . Tpm1 and Tpm2 are essential for actin - cable stability , and when temperature - sensitive tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ cells are shifted from 18 ° C to 35 ° C , actin cables disassemble within 1 min ( ref . 35 ) . This phenotype is rapid - ly reversible , with actin cables reassembling in tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ cells after 1 min of recovery at 18 ° C . To determine whether formins are required for this rapid assembly , we constructed a series of strains combining the temperature - sensitive tropomyosin mutations with bnr1 ∆ , with the irreversible bni1 - 12 allele , with both mutations , or with neither . When grown at 18 ° C , all four strains displayed prominent Tpm1 - staining cables , and when shifted to 35 ° C for 1 h , showed only diffuse Tpm1 stain ( Fig . 3 ) . As expected , tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ cells bearing one or both wild - type formin genes assembled Tpm1 - staining actin cables . However , cells bearing tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ in combination with the irreversible double bni1 - 12 bnr1 ∆ muta - tion failed to assemble any cables under the same conditions , sug - gesting that formins are required for the rapid cable reassembly observed in tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ cells . Polarized growth and spindle orientation requires formins . Actin cables guide the myosin Myo2 in delivering post - Golgi secretory vesicles to sites of polarized growth 35 and the Kar9 spindle - orienta - tion protein to the bud tip 11 . We would therefore expect that polar - ized secretion and spindle orientation also depend on Bni1 and Bnr1 . At steady state , the traffic of Myo2 along actin cables causes the accumulation at growth sites of Myo2 and Sec4 ( refs 7 , 35 ) , a Rab - GTPase associated with post - Golgi secretory vesicles 36 . We compared the ability of single bnr1 ∆ and double bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ mutants to polarize Myo2 and Sec4 at 18 ° C or 35 ° C , with partic - ular attention to their accumulation at the growing bud tip . At 18 ° C , both displayed bud - tip - localized Myo2 and Sec4 ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Temperature shift to 35 ° C had little effect on bnr1 ∆ cells , but both Myo2 and Sec4 became depolarized in bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ cells after 2 min ( Fig . 4a , arrows ) . As with cable disassembly , this depolarization occurred at all phases of the cell cycle , and was reversible in bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ cells , with Myo2 and Sec4 repolarized after 5 min at 18 ° C ( Fig . 4a ) . Consistent with a loss of polarized vesicle transport 35 , bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ mutants maintained at 35 ° C for 4 h expanded isotropically into large unbudded cells ( Fig . 4c ) . Loss of Bni1 causes defects in spindle orientation 24 , 25 but the causal link was unknown . However , loss of actin cables also causes defects in spindle orientation 11 , 37 so we examined whether the ori - entation of the mitotic spindle is affected in bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ cells , and whether defects correlated with the loss of actin cables . To quantify spindle alignment in the bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ cells , we observed the mitotic spindle through anti - β - tubulin ( Tub2 ) immunofluo - rescence . We scored spindles as properly oriented if , by extrapola - tion , they intersected the bud , a measure reflecting both the spindle’s angle to the mother – bud axis and its distance from the bud neck 37 . Around 30 % of wild - type cells score as having misori - ented spindles by these criteria 11 , as a result of natural variation , and bnr1 ∆ cells showed a similar incidence of misorientation at 18 ° C and 35 ° C ( Fig . 4d , e ) . In the bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ cells , spindle orien - tation was lost in a temperature - sensitive manner , with a jump from 26 % misoriented spindles at 18 ° C to 63 % after 5 min at 35 ° C . The speed and degree of misalignment closely matches that reported for tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ and myo2 - ts mutants 11 , 37 , indicating that formins control spindle orientation at least in part through actin cables . Activated Bni1 induces cable - like filaments . To determine whether overproduction of formins promotes assembly of actin cables , we 1 90 343 359 573 826 987 1 , 230 1 , 330 1 , 348 1 , 796 1 , 824 1 , 824 1 , 953 1 , 953 1 , 647 36 355 1 63 421 757 851 875 1 , 309 1 , 335 1 , 3361 , 375 15 % 44 % 35 % RBD RBD FH3 FH3 SBD FH1 FH1 FH2 FH2 BBD BBD DAD DAD Bni1 Bnr1 18 ° C 35 ° C Wildtype bni1 ∆ bnr1 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ a b Figure 1 Mutations in the FH2 domain conditionally disrupt the essential function of BNI1 . a , Schematic representation of the primary structures of the yeast formin homologues Bni1 and Bnr1 .

Overexpression of Bni1 triggered several changes in cytoskeletal organization , as determined by immunoflu - orescence staining of Act1 or Tpm1 and by rhodamine – phalloidin staining of F - actin . Cortical actin patches in cells overexpressing Bni1 appeared normal , but tended to be clustered toward the bud tip rather than being distributed randomly in the bud as in wild - type cells . Actin cables in the mother cells were fainter than wild - type cables ( Fig . 5b ) . The most notable change was the appearance of a focal point of filament assembly at the bud tips of cells overex - pressing Bni1 ( Fig . 5b ( arrow ) , c ) . This focal point contained both Act1 and Tpm1 , indicating that its filaments were similar in compo - sition to actin cables , and it co - localized with a carboxy - terminally tagged Bni1 ( Fig . 5b , arrows ) , suggesting that Bni1 directly stimulates assembly of cable - like filaments at the bud tip . The conserved FH1 domain of Bni1 is required for profilin binding and for Bni1 functions in polarized growth 19 , 21 , 23 . We inves - tigated whether the FH1 domain is also required for the accumula - tion of cable - like filaments at the bud tip by expressing Myc - tagged Bni1 from which the FH1 region had been deleted ( Fig . 5a ) . Consistent with a previous report 23 , Bni1 ∆ FH1 – Myc localized to growth sites ( Fig . 5b ( arrow ) , c ) . However , Bni1 ∆ FH1 – Myc did not alter Act1 or Tpm1 distribution ( Fig . 5b , c ) , suggesting that the FH1 domain may be critical in Bni1 - mediated changes to the actin cytoskeleton . Deletion of the amino - terminal RBD is expected to activate Bni1 constitutively , and prolonged expression of N - terminal trun - cations of Bni1 is toxic and causes massive accumulation of actin filaments throughout the cell 19 . To examine the effects of activated Bni1 in detail , we used two GAL1 - driven constructs : Bni1 ∆ RBD , which lacks RBD and a portion of the FH3 domain , and Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD , which lacks RBD , the FH3 domain and the region of Bni1 that binds the protein Spa2 ( Fig . 5a ) . As both the FH3 region 23 and Spa2 ( ref . 38 ) are important for recruiting Bni1 to the bud tip , both constitutively activated products were expected to be at least partially delocalized . Expression of Bni1 ∆ RBD and Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD induced a major rearrangement of F - actin from cables and patches to a large accu - mulation of filaments at growth sites . This was most dramatic in small - to medium - budded cells , where the actin assumed a contin - uous distribution along the entire bud cortex ( Fig . 5b ( arrow - heads ) , c , d ( compare control and Bni1 ∆ RBD ( arrowheads ) ) . Immunofluorescence of cells expressing a C - terminally Myc - tagged version of Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD showed that expression levels vary from cell to cell within a culture ( Fig . 5e , arrows ) . Increasing levels of Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD – Myc expression correlated with increased levels Wild type bnr1 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ bni1 ∆ Act1 Tpm1 Act1 Tpm1 18 ° C 2 min 35 ° C 12 min 35 ° C 12 min 35 ° C , 5 min 18 ° C 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 30 20 10 0 15 10 5 Time ( min ) Time ( min ) P e r c en t age c e ll s w i t h a c t i n c ab l e s P e r c en t age s m a ll / m ed i u m - budded c e ll s w i t h po l a r i z ed pa t c he s a c d b u b b u Figure 2 Loss of formin function causes rapid disassembly of actin cables . a , Actin cables , visualized by immunofluorescence with antibodies to Act1 or Tpm1 , are present in wild - type or single bni1 ∆ and bnr1 ∆ mutant cells . b , Loss of actin cables in the conditional bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ mutant is rapid and reversible .

Furthermore , this accumulation was observed in bni1 ∆ cells expressing Bni1 ∆ RBD ( data not shown ) , indicating that these constructs directly stimulate F - actin assembly rather than simply activate endogenous Bni1 . Tpm1 also associated with the bud cor - tex in Bni1 ∆ RBD - and Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD - expressing cells ( Fig . 5b , arrowheads ) , indicating that the filaments that assembled in response to activated Bni1 constructs were similar in composition to actin cables . As with overexpression of full - length Bni1 , these constructs reduced actin cables in the mother cell , leaving them thinner and shorter . Notably , the remaining cables were often con - tinuous with the cortical actin of the bud , suggesting that they might arise from the Bni1 - stimulated filaments ( Fig . 5b , d , arrow ) . Unlike the case with full - length Bni1 , actin filaments that formed in response to Bni1 ∆ RBD and Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD were not associated specifically with the bud tip ( Fig . 5b , arrows versus arrowheads ) . One possible explanation is that correct targeting of Bni1 directs F - actin assembly at the bud tip , and that the truncated constructs direct filament assembly from inappropriate locations . Consistent with this , Bni1 ∆ RBD – Myc co - localized with Tpm1 ( Fig . 5b , arrowhead ) and Act1 ( data not shown ) over the entire bud cortex . However , Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD – Myc appeared throughout the mother and bud of most cells ( Fig . 5b , c , e ) , despite the fact that the cortical Act1 and Tpm1 stains were confined to the bud . Thus , tar - geting of Bni1 to the bud tip limits assembly of cable - like filaments to that locale , but additional factors limit the assembly of cable - like filaments to the bud cortex . Cortical actin patches were no longer visible in the buds of cells expressing Bni1 ∆ RBD or Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD , and only rarely appar - ent in the mother cells of Bni1 ∆ RBD - expressing cells ( 19 % ) , giv - ing the appearance of cells lacking cortical patches ( Fig . 5b ) . Two possible explanations are that cortical patches are present in the bud but are not visible above the intense cortical staining , or that Bni1 - stimulated filament assembly depletes a common pool of actin shared with patches . As cortical - patch proteins are essential to endocytosis 5 , 6 , we assayed Bni1 ∆ RBD - expressing cells for accu - mulation of the fluid - phase marker Lucifer yellow . We found no endocytic block , with 78 % of Bni1 ∆ RBD – Myc - expressing cells and 90 % of wild - type cells showing vacuolar fluorescence due to the endocytic tracer . We also examined the distribution of a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged fusion of actin - capping protein ( Cap2 ) , a protein associated with cortical patches 39 . Despite the absence of patch - like Act1 staining in Bni1 ∆ RBD - expressing cells , 98 % of such cells displayed GFP – Cap2 patches in their buds ( Fig . 5f ) , indicating that activated Bni1 constructs specifically alter actin cable structure , yet do not affect cortical patch structure and function . Filament assembly requires profilin but not the Arp2 / 3 complex . The requirement for the FH1 domain of Bni1 in order to assemble cable - like filaments indicates the possibility that an FH1 - binding protein is important for this function . Profilin ( Pfy1 ) is the only reported ligand for the Bni1 FH1 domain 19 , 21 , and associates with the FH1 domain of all formins that have been examined . Furthermore , profilin can stimulate ADP – ATP exchange on actin , as well as promoting the incorporation of actin monomers onto the barbed ends of filaments 40 , making Pfy1 an attractive candidate for bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ BNI1bnr1 ∆ BNI1bnr1 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ BNI1bnr1 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ BNI1bnr1 ∆ bnr1 ∆ Myo2 Myo2 Sec4 Sec4 18 ° C 18 ° C 2 min 35 ° C 4 h 35 ° C 2 min 35 ° C 12 min 35 ° C , 5 min 18 ° C tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ Tub2 ( green ) Myo2 ( red ) 5 min 35 ° C 100 80 60 40 20 0 100 80 60 40 20 0 P e r c en t age s m a ll and m ed i u m bud t i p s w i t h po l a r i z a t i on s t a i n 18 ° C 2 min 35 ° C 18 ° C 5 min 35 ° C P e r c en t age s m a ll and m ed i u m - budded c e ll s w i t h m i s o r i en t ed s p i nd l e a c d e b Figure 4 Loss of formin function rapidly depolarizes vesicular targeting and misorients the mitotic spindle . a , Loss of Myo2 and Sec4 polarity in formin mutants . bnr1 ∆ and bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ cells were grown under the indicated conditions and prepared for immunofluorescence using antibodies against Myo2 and Sec4 .

At 18 ° C , the actin cytoskeleton of temperature - sensitive pfy1 - 111 mutants 41 showed prominent cortical patches ; many cells also showed aber - rant aggregates ( bars ) of monomeric actin typical of many actin cytoskeletal mutants , but few and faint actin cables ( data not shown ) . When pfy1 - 111 cells were shifted to 35 ° C for 1 h , no actin cables were visible by either anti - Act1 or anti - Tpm1 immunofluo - rescence , although actin bars and cortical patches were present ( Fig . 6a ) . Thus , we confirm that Pfy1 is required for the mainte - nance of normal actin cables 41 . When Bni1 ∆ RBD was expressed in pfy1 - 111 mutant cells at 35 ° C , no cable - like staining of the bud cortex was seen , whereas actin bars and cortical patches remained visible ( Fig . 6a ( large arrow ) , b ) , showing that Pfy1 is also required for Bni1 - stimulated filament assembly . The major known contributor to actin nucleation in vivo in yeast is the Arp2 / 3 complex 15 , 16 , 42 . Subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex are nearly essential to growth 42 , making it a likely nucleator for cable assembly , but the Arp2 / 3 complex components as well as its many known regulators , such as Vrp1 , Las17 , Myo3 and Myo5 , localize specifically to cortical patches , rather than to cables 5 . When we induced Bni1 ∆ RBD in two strains mutated for two Arp2 / 3 reg - ulators , vrp1 ∆ or myo3 ∆ myo5 ∆ , we found accumulation of cable - like filaments to the same extent as in wild - type cells , even though cortical patches in myo3 ∆ myo5 ∆ mutants appeared to be much 1 90 343 359 573 452 826 987 1 , 230 1 , 215 1 , 230 1 , 330 1 , 330 1 , 348 1 , 796 1 , 824 1 , 824 1 , 953 1 , 953 1 , 647 RBD FH3 SBD FH1 FH2 BBD DAD Bni1 Bni1 ∆ RBD Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD Bni1 ∆ FH1 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 P e r c en t age s m a ll and m ed i u m - budded c e ll s Control Bni1 – Myc Bni1 – Myc Bni1 – Myc Bni1 ∆ FH1 – Myc Bni1 ∆ RBD – Myc Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD – Myc Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD – Myc Act1 Act1 Tpm1 Control F - actin F - actin Bni1 ∆ RBD Bni1 ∆ RBD GFP – Cap2 GAL1 - induced Myc fusion None Bni1 ∆ FH1 ∆ RBD ∆ RBD / SBD a c d f b e 1 2 3 1 2 3 Figure 5 Expression of Bni1 and activated fragments reorganizes actin cable proteins . a , Diagram of Bni1 - derived constructs . b , Actin , tropomyosin and Bni1 local - ization in cells expressing C - terminally Myc - tagged Bni1 - derived constructs .

Cells lacking components of the Arp2 / 3 - complex contain cable - like filaments at the bud cortex 42 , requiring a different approach to assaying the role of this complex in formin - stimulated filament assembly . We deleted the ARP3 gene in wild - type diploid and conditional bni1 - 11 / bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ / bnr1 ∆ strains , then sporulated the diploids to isolate arp3 ∆ and arp3 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ haploids , respectively . At room tempera - ture , both strains showed abundant actin cables ( Fig . 6c ( arrows ) , d ) and actin bars , but no cortical patches were present . When shift - ed to 35 ° C , actin cables persisted in the arp3 ∆ control , but were not evident in the arp3 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ strain , leaving only actin bars and faint patch - like structures . When restored to room temperature for 10 min , cables reassembled in the arp3 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ mutant strain ( Fig . 6c ( arrows ) , d ) , showing that formin - dependent actin - cable assembly can occur in the absence of Arp2 / 3 - complex function . Bud6 / Aip3 limits filament assembly to the bud cortex . Bud6 / Aip3 and Spa2 also bind Bni1 19 , 38 . Spa2 functions with another protein , Pea2 , and deletion of either causes polarity defects similar to those of bni1 ∆ cells 26 , 43 , 44 , whereas deletion of Bud6 results in more severe actin cytoskeletal and polarity defects 45 . Previous work showed that Spa2 is required for polarization of Bni1 38 , and we found that Pea2 is also required , but Bud6 is not ( data not shown ) . However , we wished to determine whether these components are essential for the Bni1 - driven filament assembly . Neither Spa2 or Pea2 have any significant role in the ability of Bni1 to assemble cables , as both spa2 ∆ and pea2 ∆ cells had normal actin cables and patches , and the expression of Bni1 ∆ RBD induced cable - like filaments that were localized to the bud cortex of both strains ( data not shown ) . This was consistent with the fact that the Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD construct is active yet lacks the Spa2 - binding region . Bud6 associates with both formins through a C - terminal region 19 , 46 present in Bni1 ∆ RBD and Bni1 ∆ RBD / SBD , and can interact with actin in yeast two - hybrid assays 45 . As reported 45 , bud6 ∆ cells had extremely faint thin actin cables that were almost devoid of Tpm1 ( Fig . 6a ) . Expression of Bni1 ∆ RBD in bud6 ∆ cells caused an increase of Act1 - and Tpm1 - containing filaments , but these were distributed throughout the mother as disorganized cables ( Fig . 6a , small arrows ) , while within the bud , actin remained associated with cortical patches ( Fig . 6a , large arrow ) . This suggests that Bud6 functions either to retain Bni1 ∆ RBD - assembled filaments at the bud cortex or to limit Bni1 ∆ RBD activity to the bud , and that Act1 Act1 Tpm1 Control Bni1 ∆ RBD Control Bni1 ∆ RBD Wild type pfy1 - 111 35 ° C bud6 ∆ 18 ° C 15 min 35 ° C 15 min 35 ° C 10 min 18 ° C arp3 ∆ arp3 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 P e r c en t age c e ll s w i t h c ab l e - li k e a c t i n i n bud Wildtype pfy1 - 111 bud6 ∆ 100 80 60 40 20 0 18 ° C 15 min 35 ° C 15 min 35 ° C 10 min 18 ° C arp3 ∆ arp3 ∆ bni1 - 11 bnr1 ∆ a b d c P e r c en t age c e ll s w i t h a c t i n c ab l e s Figure 6 Formin - stimulated filament assembly at the bud cortex requires profilin and Bud6 but not the Arp2 / 3 complex . a , Wild - type cells , temperature - sensitive pfy1 - 111 cells preincubated at 35 ° C , and bud6 ∆ cells induced to express Bni1 ∆ RBD or containing a control plasmid were prepared for anti - Act1 and anti - Tpm1 immunofluorescence .

Tropomyosin , Mdm20 and profilin promote cable maturation . Actin cables require the tropomyosins Tpm1 and Tpm2 for sta - bility 35 . Mdm20 is a protein important to the actin - tropomyosin interaction 47 , and recently has been isolated as part of the NatB N - terminal acetyltransferase complex , indicating that actin or tropomyosin acetylation may be required ( B . Polevoda , T . S . Cardillo , G . S . Bedi , and F . Sherman , personal communication ) , consistent with mdm20 ∆ suppressor mutations in TPM1 that mimic N - terminal acetylation 47 . To address whether Tpm1 , Tpm2 or Mdm20 are required for Bni1 - directed assembly of actin fila - ments , we introduced Bni1 ∆ RBD into mdm20 ∆ and tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ mutants . As expected , in the absence of Bni1 ∆ RBD , cables were absent in tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ cells grown at 35 ° C and extremely faint cables were visible in only 5 % of mdm20 ∆ cells ( Fig . 7a , large arrows ) , whereas both strains had prominent staining for actin patches . When Bni1 ∆ RBD was expressed in tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ cells preincubated for 2 h at 35 ° C or in mdm20 ∆ cells , continuous cor - tical actin was induced ( Fig . 7a , arrowheads ) , and in some cells , tenuous actin cables were visible . Tropomyosin was not associated with cortical actin or the cables in either strain , indicating that Mdm20 is necessary for the association of tropomyosin and actin , and that tropomyosin is not required for assembling the Bni1 - induced actin filaments . Overexpression of TPM1 or TPM2 suppresses the Bni1 ∆ RBD - induced toxicity 19 , suggesting that a balance between tropomyosin levels and formin activity is crucial to the cell . Whereas expression of activated Bni1 reduced actin cables while stimulating filament accumulation at the bud cortex , coexpression of either Tpm1 or Tpm2 with Bni1 ∆ RBD induced a proliferation of actin cables in the mother cell ( Fig . 7b , arrows ) . These cables were thinner than those normally seen in wild - type cells , but resembled the fine actin cables we have seen after overproduction of Tpm1 or Tpm2 in wild - type cells ( D . P . and A . B . , unpublished observations ) , suggesting an imbalance between the tropomyosins and other cable components . Also , expression of either tropomyosin led to reduction in cable - like filaments along the bud cortex and actin patches becoming more visible ( Fig . 7b ) , again indicating that tropomyosin promotes the conversion of Bni1 - stimulated filaments at the bud cortex into actin cables in the mother . Overexpression of Pfy1 also suppresses Bni1 ∆ RBD - induced tox - icity 19 , and cells coexpressing Pfy1 and Bni1 ∆ RBD also recovered normal actin cables in the mother and patches in the bud , but unlike the tropomyosin - rescued cables , the Pfy1 - rescued cables were indistinguishable from those of wild - type cells ( Fig . 7b , arrows ) . These results suggest that Pfy1 functions at an early assembly step as well as a late maturation step in actin cable formation . Discussion In this paper , we show that the formin homologues Bni1 and Bnr1 direct the overall polarity of the budding yeast cell by assembling a polarized array of actin cables to guide secretion , organelle and mRNA inheritance , and mitotic - spindle orientation ( Fig . 8 ) . The yeast formins seem to induce the polymerization of actin filaments that are necessary precursors to tropomyosin - stabilized actin cables . Such precursors are not normally visible , but accumulate at the bud cortex of cells with increased formin activity and resemble actin cables in their ability to bind tropomyosin . When tropomyosin is overproduced in cells coexpressing an activated formin , the precursor filaments are converted into actin cables that extend into the mother cells and promote polarized growth . How might the formins drive filament assembly ? The yeast formins are Rho - GTPase - dependent 19 – 21 scaffolding proteins that bind profilin 19 , 21 and Bud6 ( refs 19 , 46 ) , two proteins necessary for proper cable assembly . The properties of both profilin and Bud6 suggest that formins complexed with them might directly mediate filament assembly . Profilin can stimulate the addition of actin monomers onto the barbed ends of elongating actin filaments 40 , and both profilin and the profilin - binding FH1 domain are required for polymerization of cable precursor filaments . Bud6 binds to actin in two - hybrid assays with a footprint suggesting that it associates specifically with F - actin 45 , and we have found that Bud6 is required to restrict the accumulation of formin - stimulated cable precursors to the bud cortex . Thus , an attractive model would have the formin – profilin complex assembling actin monomers onto the barbed ends of filaments through a mechanism involving the essential formin FH2 domain , with Bud6 retaining nascent fil - aments near the formin – profilin complex to promote the proces - sive growth of filaments required for actin cables . The rate - limiting step for actin polymerization is nucleation . Known nucleators of actin filaments include the Arp2 / 3 complex , coronin , the animal protein zyxin and the bacterial pathogen pro - tein ActA 48 – 50 . Of these , yeast has only the Arp2 / 3 complex and coronin ( Crn1p ) . However , Crn1p and the Arp2 / 3 complex and its known regulators all localize to the cortical patches and not to actin cables . Furthermore , mutations in CRN1 cause no detectable change in the actin cytoskeleton , whereas loss of Arp2 / 3 - complex components results in defects in patch formation without affecting tropomyosin - containing actin cables . The cables present in Arp2 / 3 - deficient yeast still depend on Bni1 and Bnr1 for function , indicating that the nucleation of formin - stimulated filaments is through a new Arp2 / 3 - independent pathway . Comparison of formin - dependent processes across organisms indicates that formins direct the assembly of distinct F - actin Act1 Act1 Tpm1 Control Bni1 ∆ RBD Bni1 ∆ RBD Tpm1 + Bni1 ∆ RBD Tpm2 + Bni1 ∆ RBD Pfy1 + Bni1 ∆ RBD Control Bni1 ∆ RBD tpm1 - 2 tpm2 ∆ 2 h 35 ° C mdm20 ∆ a b Figure 7 Tropomyosin , Mdm20 and profilin have roles in maturation of actin cables . a , Tropomyosin and Mdm20 are not required for Bni1 ∆ RBD - stimulated accumulation of cable - like filaments at the bud cortex .

For example , the mammalian formin mDia stimulates the assembly of actin filaments from discrete foci within the cell that serve as pre - cursors to stress fibres 27 . Although stress fibres and cables are very different in organization , their actin filaments both contain tropomyosin , are expected to be long and generally unbranched and to serve as extended substrates for myosin motors . Similarly , formins are required for proper assembly and function of contrac - tile rings in a wide variety of systems 28 , 29 , and contractile - ring fila - ments also contain tropomyosin , are unbranched and serve as myosin substrates . We thus speculate that formins are a central component of a fundamental actin - filament - assembly complex . Note added in proof : While this manuscript was in preperation , we became aware of another study that demonstrates a role for formins in the assembly of yeast actin cables ( Sagot I . , Klee S . K . & Pellman D . Yeast formins regulate cell polarity by controlling the assembly of actin cables . Nature Cell Biol . This issue ( DOI . 10 . 1038 / ncb719 ) ) . Methods Plasmids Yeast plasmids were derived from pRS316 ( URA3 ) and pRS314 ( TRP1 ) 51 . For the plasmid shuffle , p3975 ( pRS314 - BNI1 ∆ FH1 ∆ FH2 ) was generated by ligating a 7 . 0 - kb Bam HI – Not I fragment contain - ing the BNI1 promoter and the coding region from p182 ( pRS316 - BNI1 ) 19 into p1799 ( pRS314 in which the Sst II site has been replaced by that of Not I ) to create p1832 ( pRS314 - BNI1 ) , followed by removal of a Bgl II – Sst II fragment encompassing the FH1 and FH2 domains and ligation of a double - stranded linker , composed of 5 ′ - GATCTT CGCGAACGCGTGC - 3 ′ plus 5 ′ - ACGCGTTCGCGAA - 3 ′ bearing Nru I and Mlu I sites ( underlined ) . For construction of GAL1 - inducible BNI1 , the GAL1 promoter was ligated between the Eco RI and Bam HI sites of a pRS316 - derived plasmid lacking the polylinker region between Kpn I and Eco RI , gen - erating the control plasmid p113 ( pRS316 - GAL1 ) . To generate p2501 ( pRS316 - GAL1 - BNI1 ) , a 6 . 0 - kb Bam HI – Not I fragment from p532 ( pRS316 - BNI1 ) 19 was cloned into p113 . To generate C - terminally Myc - tagged BNI1 , the Stop codon of BNI1 was eliminated in p1832 by replacing a 1 . 5 - kb Sst II – Not I fragment with Sst II – Nru I - digested PCR - derived sequence using the primers 5 ′ - AGGATCCCCGCGGAAGAAGAAGAAAGACTTTATAT - 3 ′ and 5 ′ - AGCGGCCGCC - TATCGCGATTTGAAACTTAGCCTCTTACCTGTGCT - 3 ′ . This was followed by ligation of the linker ( 5 ′ - ATAACGCGTTAT - 3 ′ ) into the Nru I site ( Mlu I site underlined ) , generating p1851 ( pRS314 - BNI1 minus the endogenous Stop ) . A 7 . 0 - kb Bam HI – Mlu I fragment of p1851 bearing the altered BNI1 sequence was fused to GFP in pRS316 bearing GFP sequence downstream of the Mlu I site ( Pharmacia ) , generating p1912 ( pRS316 - BNI1 - GFP ) , and a 500 - bp Nhe I – Not I fragment including the 3 ′ BNI1 coding sequence was fused to GFP then replaced the same region of p2501 . Finally , the GFP sequence was replaced with a Mlu I – Not I - digested 500 - bp cassette bearing 13 repeats of the Myc epi - tope ( Myc 13 ) followed by a Stop codon , generating p2529 ( pRS316 - GAL1 - BNI1 - 13myc ) . GAL1 - inducible BNI1 - 13myc lacking the FH1 region was created by digestion of p2529 with Bgl II and fol - lowed by religation to generate p2723 ( pRS316 - GAL1 - BNI1 ∆ FH1 - 13myc ) . GAL1 - inducible BNI1 lacking the RBD was generated by ligating a Msc I – Not I fragment from p182 into p113 , giving p356 ( pRS316 - GAL1 - BNI1 ∆ RBD ) . C - terminally tagged BNI1 - ∆ RBD was generated in two steps through replacement of the 3 ′ BNI1 sequence in p356 first with a 500 - bp Nhe I – Not I frag - ment from p1912 , then with the Mlu I – Not I - digested Myc 13 cassette , yielding p2528 ( pRS316 - GAL1 - BNI1 ∆ RBD - 13myc ) . GAL1 - inducible BNI1 lacking the RBD , FH3 and SBD was made by ligation of an Eco 47III – Not I fragment from p182 behind the GAL1 - promoter of Nru I – Not I - digested p527 ( ref . 19 ) . A C - terminal Myc tag was introduced through the same procedures as above to generate p2523 ( pRS316 - GAL1 - BNI1 ∆ RBD / SBD - 13myc ) . Other plasmids used were : pRS316 - GAL1 - TPM1 ( ref . 19 ) , pRS316 - GAL1 - TPM2 ( ref . 19 ) , p356 ( 2 µ : : PFY1 ) 19 , pDP124 ( to convert CAP2 into cap2 : : GFPCAP2 ) 35 . Yeast strains All yeast strains generated during this study were derived from W303 background strains W3031A ( MAT α ade2 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 leu2 - 3 , 112 ura3 - 1 trp1 - 1 can1 - 100 ) and W3031B ( MAT a ade2 - 1 his3 - 11 , 15 leu2 - 3 , 112 ura3 - 1 trp1 - 1 can1 - 100 ) , or S288c background strains Y1239 ( MAT a his3 ∆ 1 met15 ∆ 0 leu2 ∆ 0 ura3 ∆ 0 ) and Y1240 ( MAT α his3 ∆ 1 leu2 ∆ 0 lys2 ∆ 0 ura3 ∆ 0 ) .

For tropomyosin - dependent cable assembly assays , Y4135 was crossed to ABY944 ( ref . 35 ) and sporulated , and the following strains were used : ABY944 ( tpm1 - 2 : : LEU2 tpm2 ∆ : : HIS3 ) , ABY1804 ( tpm1 - 2 : : LEU2 tpm2 ∆ : : HIS3 bnr1 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) , ABY1805 ( tpm1 - 2 : : LEU2 tpm2 ∆ : : HIS3 bni1 - 12 : : URA3 ) , and ABY1806 ( tpm1 - 2 : : LEU2 tpm2 ∆ : : HIS3 bni1 - 12 : : URA3 bnr1 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) . The cytoskeletal effects of production of tagged - and untagged - Bni1 - derived constructs were exam - ined by transformation of plasmids p113 , p2501 , p356 , p2529 , p2723 , p2523 and p2528 into W3031A , and transformation of p113 and p356 into Y1239 , Y1239 - derived strains ABY1802 ( bni1 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) , ABY1810 ( spa2 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) , ABY1811 ( pea2 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) , ABY1813 ( vrp1 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) , ABY1809 ( bud6 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) and 1807 ( tpm1 - 2 : : LEU2 tpm2 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) , and JSY1605 ( mdm20 ∆ ) 47 and BHY46 ( pfy1 - 111 : : LEU2 ) 41 . The cytoskeletal effects of Bni1 ∆ RBD in the absence of MYO3 and MYO5 were examined by the deletion of those genes from Y488 ( MAT a ade2 - 1 leu2 - 3 , 112 trp1 - 1 ura3 - 1 can1 - 100 ade8 ∆ : : GAL1 - BNI1 ∆ RBD mfa2 ∆ : : FUS1 - lacZ his3 ∆ : : FUS1 - HIS3 ) 19 to generate Y1450 ( MAT α ade8 ∆ : : GAL1 - BNI1 ∆ RBD myo3 ∆ : : HIS3 myo5 ∆ : : TRP1 ) . The cytoskeletal effects of co - overexpression of Bni1 ∆ RBD and Tpm1 , Tpm2 or Pfy1 were examined by transformation of Y488 with pRS316 - GAL1 - TPM1 , pRS316 - GAL1 - TPM2 , or p356 ( 2 µ : : PFY1 ) . For visual analysis of GFP – Cap2 patches , Y488 was transformed with pDP124 . For analysis of yeast lacking functional Arp2 / 3 complex , ABY1857 ( MATa arp3 ∆ : : LEU2 ) was generat - ed from ABY1848 and ABY1858 ( MATabni1 - 11 : : URA3 bnr1 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) was generated from ABY1803 by deletion of one ARP3 locus followed by sporulation of the heterozygous diploid . Isolation of conditional bni1 - ts mutants PCR - derived mutagenized DNA encoding the BNI1 FH1 and FH2 regions ( residues 1 , 230 – 1 , 749 ) was amplified with primers ( 5 ′ - ATAAAACAGCGGATTTCAGCGCTGTGAGTAAACTGAATAATACAGATG - GCGCAGA - 3 ′ ) and ( 5 ′ - TTTTGCTGTTCTTCCACTATTTTCTTATGCTT - TATATAAAGTCTTTCTTCTTCTT - 3 ′ ) using standard protocols 52 . Y2804 ( bni1 ∆ bnr1 ∆ p182 [ URA3 BNI1 ] ) was cotransformed with the PCR products and Mlu I – Bgl II - linearized p3975 . Transformants were grown at the permissive temperature of 26 ° C on 5 - fluoro - orotic acid - containing medium to select for loss of p182 , then replica - plated at 35 ° C to identify temperature - sensitive isolates . Two alleles , bni1 - 11 and bni1 - 12 were targeted to the BNI1 locus in Y2304 ( Y1239 with bnr1 ∆ : : KanMX6 ) by homologous recombination to create Y4133 ( bni1 - 11 : : URA3 bnr1 : : KanMX6 ) and Y4135 ( bni1 - 12 - URA3 bnr1 : : kanMX6 ) . Treatment of cells for temperature - shift and galactose - induction experiments For temperature - shift experiments , 1 - ml aliquots of mid - log - phase cultures grown in rich medium were transferred to prewarmed and cooledculture tubes , and fixed after incubation by direct addition of formaldehyde to 5 % concentration before preparation for fluorescence microscopy . For galactose - induction experiments , mid - log - phase cultures grown in defined raffinose medium were induced by the addition of 2 % galactose for 2h before fixation with 5 % formaldehyde and preparation for fluorescence microscopy . Actin cytoskeletal organization , polarized vesicular targeting and spindle ori - entation assays For each assay , 100 small - to medium - budded cells ( bud lengths less than or equal to 2 / 3 the length of the mother cell ) were scored . For actin cytoskeletal organization assays , cells were either stained with rhodamine – phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) to visualize F - actin 4 , or stained by immunofluo - rescence using anti - Act1 polyclonal antibodies , anti - Tpm1 polyclonal antibodies , or double - labelled with anti - Act1 polyclonal and anti - Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibodies ( Boehringer Mannheim ) , or dou - ble - labelled with anti - Tpm1 polyclonal and anti - Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibodies , all as treated as described for anti - Tpm1 immunofluorescence 35 . Cells were scored as having actin cables when any cables at all were visible with Act1 antibodies . Cells with fewer than 10 Act1 - stained cortical patches in the mother were scored as having polarized patches . Cable - like actin staining in the bud was defined as the presence of a continuous actin stain over the bud cortex and the absence of visible patches . For polarized vesicular targeting assays , cells were labelled with either anti - Myo2 or anti - Sec4 antibodies as described 35 , and scored as polarized when staining was enriched at the bud tip . For spindle orientation , cells were double - labelled using anti - Tub2 and anti - Myo2 polyclonal antibodies and scored as having a correctly oriented spindle when an extrapolation of the Tub2 - labelled spindle intersected the bud neck , as done previously 11 .
