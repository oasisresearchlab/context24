Actin is a major 28 component of dendritic spines , and we previously found that alcohol alters actin composition and 29 dendritic spine structure in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) and the dorsomedial striatum ( DMS ) . 30 To examine if Rac1 contributes to these alcohol - mediated adaptations , we measured the level of 31 GTP - bound active Rac1 in the striatum of male and female mice following 7 weeks of intermittent 32 access to 20 % alcohol . We found that chronic alcohol intake activates Rac1 in the DMS , but not 33 in the NAc and DLS of male mice . Chronic excessive alcohol intake does not activate Rac1 in the 34 DMS of female mice . Similarly , closely related small G - proteins are not activated by alcohol in the 35 DMS , and Rac1 activity is not increased in the DMS by moderate alcohol or natural reward . To 36 determine the consequences of alcohol - dependent Rac1 activation in the DMS of male mice , we 37 inhibited endogenous Rac1 . We infected the DMS of mice with an AAV expressing a dominant 38 negative form of the small G - protein ( Rac1 - DN ) . We found that overexpression of AAV - Rac1 - DN 39 in the DMS inhibits alcohol - mediated Rac1 signaling and attenuates alcohol - mediated F - Actin 40 polymerization , which corresponded with a decrease in dendritic arborization and spine 41 maturation . Finally , we provide evidence to suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays a role in alcohol - 42 associated goal - directed learning . Together , our data suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays an 43 important role in alcohol - dependent structural plasticity and aberrant learning . 44 45 46 3 Significance Statement 47 Addiction , including alcohol use disorder , is characterized by molecular and cellular 48 adaptations that promote maladaptive behaviors . We found that Rac1 was activated by alcohol in 49 the dorsomedial striatum ( DMS ) of male mice . We show that alcohol - mediated Rac1 signaling is 50 responsible for alterations in actin dynamics and neuronal morphology . We also present data to 51 suggest that Rac1 is important for alcohol - associated learning process . These results suggest 52 that Rac1 in the DMS is an important contributor to adaptations that promote alcohol use disorder . 53 54 4 Introduction 55 Rac1 ( Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ) is a small G - protein belonging to the 56 Rho family of GTPases ( Van Aelst and D ' Souza - Schorey , 1997 ; Vetter and Wittinghofer , 2001 ; 57 Bosco et al . , 2009 ) . Rac1 is expressed ubiquitously and plays a role in processes such as actin 58 polymerization , endocytosis , transcription , and cell growth ( Nakayama et al . , 2000 ; Ridley , 2006 ; 59 Bosco et al . , 2009 ) . Rac1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system ( CNS ) ( Corbetta et 60 al . , 2009 ) . Rac1 cycles between a GDP - bound inactive state and a GTP - bound active state 61 ( Vetter and Wittinghofer , 2001 ) . In the CNS , the transition between GDP - bound to GTP - bound 62 Rac1 is catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide - exchange factors ( GEFs ) Tiam1 and Karilin - 7 ( Vetter 63 and Wittinghofer , 2001 ; Tolias et al . , 2005 ; Xie et al . , 2007 ) . The Rac1 GTPase activating proteins 64 ( GAPs ) , such as RacGAP1 or FilGAP ( Toure et al . , 1998 ; Nguyen et al . , 2018 ) , initiate the intrinsic 65 GTPase activity of Rac1 resulting in the conversion of GTP to GDP ( Vetter and Wittinghofer , 66 2001 ) . Upon activation , Rac1 binds to p21 - activated kinase ( PAK1 ) leading to PAK1 67 autophosphorylation and activation ( Bokoch , 2003 ) . PAK1 phosphorylates and activates LIM 68 kinase ( LIMK ) ( Edwards et al . , 1999 ) . LIMK then phosphorylates cofilin ( Yang et al . , 1998 ; 69 Bernard , 2007 ; Scott and Olson , 2007 ) . Cofilin’s function is to sever actin filaments ( F - actin ) into 70 globular actin ( G - actin ) ( Yang et al . , 1998 ; Bamburg , 1999 ; Maciver and Hussey , 2002 ; 71 Andrianantoandro and Pollard , 2006 ; Chin et al . , 2016 ; Kanellos and Frame , 2016 ) . LIMK 72 phosphorylation of cofilin prevents cofilin’s ability to cleave actin , therefore enabling the formation 73 and maintenance of F - actin ( Yang et al . , 1998 ; Pavlov et al . , 2007 ; Scott and Olson , 2007 ) . This 74 mechanism promotes spine enlargement and stabilizes and strengthens synapses ( Honkura et 75 al . , 2008 ; Chazeau and Giannone , 2016 ; Costa et al . , 2020 ) . As such , Rac1 is involved in long - 76 term potentiation , the cellular mechanism of learning and memory ( Haditsch et al . , 2009 ; Haditsch 77 et al . , 2013 ; Lv et al . , 2019 ) . 78 Malfunction of Rac1 has been associated with multiple neurological and psychiatric 79 disorders . For example , abnormal expression of Rac1 has been observed in humans suffering 80 5 from schizophrenia , autism spectrum disorders , and fragile X syndrome ( Tejada - Simon , 2015 ; 81 Reijnders et al . , 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . A reduction of Rac1 expression is also associated with 82 stress , depression , and anhedonia in mice ( Golden et al . , 2013 ) , symptoms that often coincide 83 with addiction ( Koob and Kreek , 2007 ) . Abnormal Rac1 function has been linked to drugs of 84 abuse . Specifically , Rac1 activity is inhibited after repeated , but not acute , cocaine administration 85 in the NAc of mice ( Dietz et al . , 2012 ) , and Rac1 - dependent mechanisms affect the extinction of 86 aversive opiate withdrawal memories ( Wang et al . , 2017 ) . Finally , Rac1 orthologs have been 87 shown to regulate ethanol acute sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster ( Peru et al . , 2012 ) . 88 However , Rac1 ’s function in alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) has not been investigated in a 89 mammalian system . 90 Previously , we found that excessive chronic alcohol consumption promotes the formation 91 of F - actin in the NAc ( Laguesse et al . , 2017 ) and in the dorsomedial striatum ( DMS ) of mice 92 ( Wang et al . , 2015 ; Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) . We further found that heavy alcohol consumption in 93 mice results in a structural remodeling in both brain regions , leading to the maturation of dendritic 94 spines in the NAc and in the branching of dendrites and remodeling of dendritic spines in DMS 95 ( Wang et al . , 2015 ; Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) . Here , we examined the possibility that Rac1 controls 96 these alcohol - dependent structural adaptations in the NAc and / or the DMS . 97 6 Materials and Methods 98 Antibodies 99 Rabbit anti - pLIMK ( # ab38508 ) antibodies were purchased from Abcam ( Waltham , MA ) .

Mice were housed 120 individually in a reversed 12 - hour light - dark cycle room ( lights on at 22 : 00 / off at 10 : 00 ) that was 121 temperature - and humidity - controlled . Unrestricted amounts of food and water were provided . 122 7 Animal procedures were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 123 ( IACUC ) . 124 125 Preparation of solutions 126 Alcohol solution was prepared from an absolute anhydrous alcohol solution ( 190 proof ) diluted to 127 20 % ( v / v ) in tap water for alcohol - drinking experiments . Sucrose solution ( 1 % ) was dissolved in 128 tap water ( w / v ) . 129 130 Collection of brain samples for biochemical analyses 131 Mice were euthanized 4 hours after the beginning of the last drinking session ( “binge” timepoint ) 132 or 24 hours after the last drinking session ( “withdrawal” timepoint ) . Brains were removed and 133 dissected on an ice - cold platform into 1mm sections , and specific subregions were dissected 134 based on Allen Brain Atlas anatomy . 135 136 Western blot analysis 137 Tissue was homogenized in ice - cold radio immunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) buffer ( in mM : 50 138 Tris - HCL , 5 EDTA , 120 NaCl , and 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 1 % deoxycholate , 0 . 5 % SDS , proteases and 139 phosphatases inhibitors ) . Samples were homogenized using a sonic dismembrator . Protein 140 content was determined using BCA ™ protein assay kit . Thirty µg of each tissue lysate was loaded 141 for separation by SDS - PAGE then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane at 300mA for 2 142 hours . Membranes were blocked with 5 % milk - PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 at room 143 temperature ( RT ) for 30 minutes and then probed with the appropriated primary antibodies 144 overnight at 4ºC . The membranes were washed and probed with HRP - conjugated secondary 145 antibodies for one hour at room temperature . Membranes were developed using the enhanced 146 chemiluminescent reagent ( ECL ) and band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software 147 ( NIH ) . 148 8 Small G - protein activation assay 149 Small G - protein activity was determined using the Rac1 , RhoA , or Cdc42 activation in vivo assay 150 biochemical kits for the respective protein ( Cytoskeleton Inc . , Denver , CO ) . The tissues were 151 lysed in lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris - HCl pH7 . 4 , 450mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 ) containing protease 152 and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail . Thirty µg of each lysate was incubated with 10 µL PAK 153 Rac1 / Cdc42 binding domain ( PAK - PBD ) - agarose beads for Rac1 and Cdc42 , or 15 µL Rhotekin 154 Rho binding domain ( Rhotekin - RBD ) - agarose beads for RhoA , for 16 hours . For the control , the 155 same amount of lysate was incubated with GDP or GTP for 15 minutes followed by incubation 156 with PAK - PBD or Rhotekin - RBD - agarose beads for 16 hours . The beads were washed twice with 157 washing buffer followed by boiling in 30 µL 2X sample loading buffer . The samples were analyzed 158 by western blot . 159 160 F - actin / G - actin assay 161 F - actin and G - actin content was measured using the G - actin / F - actin in vivo assay biochemical kit 162 ( Cytoskeleton Inc . , Denver , CO ) as previously described in ( Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) with slight 163 modification . Tissue punches were homogenized in 250 µL cold LAS02 buffer containing protease 164 and phosphatases inhibitors and centrifuged at 350g for 5 minutes at 4ºC to remove cellular 165 debris . Protein concentrations were determined in the supernatant using BCA ™ protein assay kit . 166 Supernatant was centrifuged at 15 , 000g for 30 minutes at 4ºC and the new supernatant contained 167 soluble globular actin ( G - actin ) . The insoluble filamentous actin ( F - actin ) in the pellet was then 168 resuspended and incubated on ice for 1 hour in 250 µL F - actin depolymerization buffer , with gently 169 mixing every 15 minutes . Samples were centrifuged at 15 , 000g for 30 minutes at 4ºC and this 170 supernatant was used to measure F - actin content by western blot . Twenty µL of the G - actin 171 fraction and 40 µL of the F - actin fractions were loaded and analyzed by western blot . 172 173 174 9 Adeno - associated viruses 175 AAV2 - Rac1 - DN - GFP ( AAV - Rac1 - DN ; 3 . 5x10 12 vg / ml ) was produced by the Duke Viral Vector 176 Core ( Durham , North Carolina ) . The plasmid containing the T17N Rac1 mutation ( plasmid 177 # 22784 , pCyPet - Rac1 ( T17N ) ) and AAV - GFP ( pAAV . CMV . PI . EGFP . WPRE . bGH ; 1 . 6x10 13 vg / ml ) 178 were purchased from Addgene . AAV - GFP was diluted to match the concentration of AAV - Rac1 - 179 DN . 180 181 Confirmation of AAV - Rac1 - DN in cells 182 HEK293 cells were plated at 120 , 000 cells per well on a 12 - well - plate . The media was changed 183 to 1 % FBS - DMEM 24 hours prior to the infection . The cells were then infected with 2 µL of AAV - 184 Rac1 - DN virus ( 3 . 5x10 12 vg / ml ) . Seventy - two hours after the infection , cells were incubated with 185 10 % FBS for 30 minutes . The cells were lysed and analyzed by western blot . 186 187 Stereotaxic surgery 188 Mice were anesthetized using vaporized isoflurane and were fixed in a stereotaxic frame ( David 189 Kopf Instruments ) . To overexpress the virus in the entirety of the DMS , bilateral microinfusions 190 were accomplished using stainless steel injectors ( 33 gauge ; Small Parts Incorporated ) 191 connected to Hamilton syringes ( 10 µL , 1701 ) at two sites in the DMS ( anteroposterior ( AP ) + 1 . 1 192 mm , mediolateral ( ML ) ± 1 . 2 mm , dorsoventral ( DV ) - 3 mm and AP + 0 . 66 mm , ML ± 1 . 2 mm , DV 193 - 2 . 8 mm measured from bregma ) . Animals received a 1μL bilateral infusion of AAV - GFP or AAV - 194 Rac1 - DN - GFP ( 3 . 5x10 12 vg / ml ) at an infusion rate of 0 . 1μL / min controlled by an automatic pump 195 ( Harvard Apparatus ) . The injectors were left at the infusion site for 10 minutes after the conclusion 196 of the infusion to allow the virus to diffuse . 197 To image single neurons , a low - titer ( 7x10 9 - 3 . 5x10 10 vg / ml ) of AAV - GFP or AAV - Rac1 - DN - GFP 198 was infused into the DMS ( AP + 1 . 1 mm , ML ± 1 . 2 mm , DV - 2 . 8 mm ) . 0 . 5μL of each virus was 199 10 infused bilaterally at a rate of 0 . 1μL / min . Injectors were left in place for 10 minutes for viral 200 diffusion . 201 202 In vivo confirmation of viral expression 203 After the conclusion of an experiment , animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation and the 204 brains were removed . The brain was dissected on ice into 1 - mm - thick coronal sections and green 205 fluorescent protein ( GFP ) was visualized and imaged using an EVOS FL tabletop fluorescent 206 microscope ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Mice with surgeries that failed to elicit viral 207 overexpression were excluded from the study . 208 209 Immunostaining 210 Mice were euthanized by transcardial perfusion with 0 . 01M PBS followed by 4 % 211 paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate buffer , for 5 minutes each step . Brains were removed and 212 postfixed in 4 % PFA for 24 hours before being transferred to a 30 % sucrose solution for 3 days . 213 Brains were then frozen rapidly on dry ice before being coronally sectioned into 100 μm sections 214 using a Leica CM3050 cryostat ( Leica Biosystems , Richmond , IL ) . Slices were placed in 0 . 01M 215 PBS and the ones containing the site of infection were selected to be stained . Sections were 216 blocked with 5 % normal donkey serum for 4 hours . Slices were incubated in the primary antibody 217 over 48 hours at 4°C on an orbital shaker . After primary antibody incubation , slices were washed 218 3 times for 45 minutes each in PBS before secondary antibody incubation overnight at 4°C on an 219 orbital shaker . There was another cycle of washing before placing the slices onto Superfrost Plus 220 microscope slides ( Fisher Scientific , Hampton , NH ) and mounting slides using Prolong Gold 221 mounting medium ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Slides were allowed 24 hours to dry 222 before the edges were sealed to prevent dehydration . 223 224 225 11 Morphological analysis 226 Low titer of AAV - GFP or AAV - Rac1 - DN ( 7x10 9 - 3 . 5x10 10 vg / ml ) was infused bilaterally into the 227 DMS . After 1 week of recovery , mice underwent 7 weeks of IA20 % 2BC . Twenty - four hours after 228 the last drinking session , mice were euthanized , perfused , processed , and 100 µm coronal 229 sections were collected . Images of GFP - stained DMS neurons were acquired with a spinning disk 230 confocal microscope with a 40x objective and a Z - interval of 1μm ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Images 231 were deconvoluted using AutoQuantX ( v3 . 1 . 3 , Media cybernetics , Inc , Rockville , MD ) , and GFP 232 neurons were traced using Neurolucida software ( MBF Biosciences , Williston , VT ) . 233 Scholl analysis : Dendritic branches were quantified using Sholl analysis ( Sholl , 1953 ) . Starting 234 radius of dendritic branches was 10μm and end radius was 160μm from the center of the soma 235 with an interval of 10μm between radii . Cell body area was measured using Fiji software ( NIH ) . 236 Spine Analysis : Images of GFP - stained DMS neurons were acquired with a spinning disk confocal 237 microscope with a 100x objective and a Z - interval of 0 . 1μm ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Only distal 238 dendrites ( 3 rd or 4 th order ) were analyzed . Morphological properties were analyzed using Imaris 239 software ( Oxford Instruments , Concord , MA ) . Dendritic spines were classified based on a 240 combination of length and head and neck morphology . Spines were classified into four subtypes 241 as in ( Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) : filipodia ( > 2μm length , indiscernible head ) , stubby ( < 1μm length , no 242 visible neck ) , mushroom ( > 0 . 4 μm head width , short neck ) , thin ( head width < 0 . 4 μm , long neck ) . 243 244 Behavioral paradigms 245 2 - bottle choice drinking paradigm 246 Intermittent access to 20 % alcohol ( IA20 % 2BC ) : The paradigm was conducted as described in 247 ( Laguesse et al . , 2017 ) . Mice were given 24 - hour access to one bottle of 20 % alcohol ( v / v ) in tap 248 water or one bottle of water . Drinking sessions started at 11 : 30AM Monday , Wednesday , and 249 Friday with 24 - or 48 - hour ( weekend ) withdrawal periods in between during which only water was 250 available . The bottles were alternated each session to prevent a side preference from developing . 251 12 The bottles were weighed at the end of each session and adjusted for spill . Mice were weighed 252 once a week . Animals that drank over 7g / kg / 24hr were included in the study . See Table 1 for 253 average values in each of the experiments . Percentile of alcohol preference ( preference index ) 254 was calculated by dividing the amount of alcohol drank to the amount of water + alcohol X100 . 255 Intermittent access to 1 % sucrose : Mice had access to a 2 - bottle choice between water and 1 % 256 sucrose three days a week for 24 - hour periods for two weeks ( Laguesse et al . , 2017 ) . Bottles 257 were weighed at the end of each session and switched in between . Between sessions , only water 258 was available . The bottle weights were spill - adjusted after each session . Mice were weighed 259 weekly , and 1 % sucrose consumption was measured in milliliters per kilogram of bodyweight 260 ( ml / kg ) . Food was available ad libitum . 261 Continuous access to 10 % alcohol : Mice had access to a bottle of 10 % alcohol ( v / v ) in tap water 262 and a bottle of water for 24 hours a day for 3 weeks ( 21 drinking sessions ) ( Laguesse et al . , 2017 ) 263 Bottles were removed and weighed daily . Bottle positions were alternated to reduce side 264 preference development . The bottle weights were spill - adjusted after each session . Mice were 265 weighed weekly and alcohol consumption was calculated for each in grams per kilogram . 266 Operant self - administration ( OSA ) : OSA was conducted as described in ( Laguesse et al . , 2017 ) . 267 Mice underwent stereotaxic surgery and IA20 % 2BC for 7 - 8 weeks as described above . Prior to 268 training , animals were handled for 1 - 2 minutes per day for 3 consecutive days . OSA was 269 conducted during the dark phase of the reverse light / dark cycle in operant chambers ( length : 22 270 cm , width : 20 cm , height : 14 cm ) . OSA boxes were connected to a computer running MED - PC to 271 control and record session activity . The operant chambers ( Med - Associates ; Georgia , VT ) had 272 two levers ( length : 1 . 5 cm , distance between : 11 cm , height above floor : 2 . 5 cm ) on one wall . The 273 operant chambers were also equipped with a reward port between the levers ( height above floor : 274 0 . 5 cm ) that included a photo - beam to track port entries . Upon reward delivery , a 3 - second tone 275 ( 2900Hz ) and a cue - light above the reward port was activated . To receive a reward , the mouse 276 must press the active lever in a fixed - ratio 1 ( FR1 ) schedule , where one active - lever press leads 277 13 to one reward . A successful completion of this condition resulted in a delivery of 10 µL of 20 % 278 alcohol to the reward port . The mouse must enter the reward port twice to reactivate the active 279 lever , ensuring consumption of the reward . Animals received a total of 20 hours of training time 280 in the paradigm in the first week ( two 6 - hour and two 4 - hour sessions ) before transitioning to 2 - 281 hour afternoon sessions that began consistently at 13 : 00 . After 8 2 - hour FR1 sessions , the 282 complexity of the task was increased to FR2 , where two active lever presses were required for 283 one reward . Active lever presses , inactive lever presses , port entries , and reward deliveries were 284 measured . Consumption was normalized based on mouse body weight and rewards 285 administered . Discrimination index was calculated as the percentage of active lever presses 286 divided by total presses . The proportion of reward lever presses statistic was calculated by 287 comparing lever presses that led to a reward to total lever presses , including inactive lever 288 presses . Mice with low viral expression were excluded from the study . 289 Sucrose operant self - administration : OSA of 1 % sucrose was slightly modified from conditions 290 described in ( Laguesse et al . , 2017 ) . Specifically , mice underwent stereotaxic surgery to 291 overexpress AAV - GFP or AAV - Rac1 - DN - GFP in the DMS . After allowing for viral overexpression , 292 mice began 1 % sucrose self - administration training in the chambers previously described with 293 two 6 - hour and two 4 - hour training sessions in the first week . Animals were handled for 1 - 2 294 minutes daily for 3 consecutive days before training began . They then transitioned to 2 - hour 295 afternoon sessions that began consistently at 13 : 00 . After 8 2 - hour FR1 sessions , the mice 296 transitioned to FR2 . Mice with low viral expression were excluded from the study . 297 298 Open - field test 299 Mice infected with either AAV - GFP or AAV - Rac1 - DN were placed in an open field ( 43cm x 43cm ) 300 in low - light conditions and allowed to explore for 20 minutes ( Warnault et al . , 2016 ) . Locomotor 301 activity was tracked using EthoVision XT software ( Noldus , Leesburg , VA ) , and total movement 302 ( cm ) was reported . 303 14 Data analysis 304 GraphPad Prism 9 and MATLAB were used for statistical analysis . 305 Biochemical analysis : Data were analyzed using the appropriate statistical test , including one - 306 way ANOVA , two - way ANOVA , or two - tailed t - test for normal populations , or Kruskal - Wallis for 307 non - normal populations . Post hoc testing was done using Šidák’s multiple comparisons test . 308 Biochemical analysis : Data were analyzed using the appropriate statistical test , including one - 309 way ANOVA , two - way ANOVA , or two - tailed t - test for normal populations , or Kruskal - Wallis for 310 non - normal populations . Post hoc testing was done using Šidák’s multiple comparisons tes t . 311 IA20 % 2BC numbers are expressed as the mean ± SEM consumption over the final two weeks 312 ( Table 1 ) . Data was first tested for normality using the Shapiro - Wilk normality test with 313 accompanying QQ plot . Parametric tests were performed on data samples deemed to be derived 314 from normal populations . The results were determined to be statistically significant if the resulting 315 p - value was less than 0 . 05 . 316 Behavioral analysis : IA - 2BC and OSA data were analyzed using a two - way repeated - measures 317 ANOVA , followed by post hoc Šidák’s multiple comparisons test . A two - tailed t - test was performed 318 on the open - field locomotion . The results were determined to be statistically significant if the 319 resulting p - value was less than 0 . 05 . 320 15 Results 321 Alcohol activates Rac1 in the DMS of male mice 322 We first tested if repeated cycles of alcohol binge drinking and withdrawal activates Rac1 323 in the striatum of male mice . Specifically , animals were subjected to 7 weeks of 20 % alcohol or 324 water choice for 24 hours a day , 3 days a week , with 24 - or 48 - ( weekend ) hour withdrawal periods 325 in between during which mice had access to water only . Mice consuming water for the same 326 duration were used as controls ( Figure 1A ) . Striatal regions were dissected and harvested 4 327 hours after the beginning of a drinking session ( “binge” ) or 24 hours after the end of a drinking 328 session ( “withdrawal” ) ( Figure 1A ) . Rac1 - GTP pulldown assay was utilized to analyze the level 329 of active GTP - bound vs . inactive GDP - bound Rac1 . We found that the activity of Rac1 was 330 unaltered by alcohol in the NAc ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ) and the DLS ( Figure 1C , Table 1 ) ( NAc 331 Kruskal - Wallis test H = 0 . 5731 , p = 0 . 7761 ; DLS One - way ANOVA : F ( 2 , 15 ) = 0 . 0139 , p = 0 . 9862 ) . 332 In contrast , we discovered that 7 weeks IA20 % 2BC produced a robust activation of Rac1 in the 333 DMS during both binge and withdrawal ( Figure 1D , Table 1 ) ( One - way ANOVA : F ( 2 , 15 ) = 8 . 233 , 334 p = 0 . 0039 ; Post hoc : Water vs . Binge p = 0 . 0058 , W vs . WD p = 0 . 0068 ) . The same pattern of 335 Rac1 activation was also observed during withdrawal after 4 weeks of IA20 % 2BC ( Extended 336 Figure 1A , Table 1 ) ( Unpaired t - test : t ( 6 ) = 2 , 938 , p = 0 . 0260 ) . In contrast , Rac1 activity was 337 unaltered in the DMS of female mice undergoing 7 weeks of IA20 % 2BC ( Figure 1E , Table 1 ) 338 ( Kruskal - Wallis test H = 0 . 2456 , p = 0 . 8968 ) , suggesting that alcohol - dependent Rac1 activation 339 is sexually dimorphic . Together , these data suggest that chronic voluntary drinking of alcohol 340 produces a long - lasting activation of Rac1 in the DMS of male mice . 341 342 Rac1 activation by alcohol in the DMS is specific 343 Next , we set to determine the specificity of alcohol - dependent activation of Rac1 in the 344 DMS . The closely related small G - proteins RhoA and Cdc42 have also been linked with synaptic 345 and structural plasticity ( Francis et al . , 2019 ; Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . We found that levels of RhoA 346 16 and Cdc42 bound to GTP ( Figure 2A - B , Table 1 ) were unchanged in the DMS at both binge and 347 withdrawal from IA20 % 2BC as compared to water - only drinking mice ( RhoA One - way ANOVA : 348 F ( 2 , 15 ) = 0 . 472 , p = 0 . 06323 ; Cdc42 Kruskal - Wallis test H = 3 . 310 , p = 0 . 1962 ) . To measure if 349 Rac1 is activated in response to moderate consumption of alcohol , we exposed mice to a 10 % 350 continuous access ( 10 % CA ) 2 - bottle - choice alcohol drinking paradigm in which mice were 351 allowed to choose between 10 % alcohol and water continuously for 21 days , matching the number 352 IA20 % 2BC sessions . We detected no change in the activation of Rac1 in the DMS after 10 % CA 353 ( Figure 2C , Table 1 ) ( Unpaired t - test : t ( 10 ) = 0 . 3960 , p = 0 . 7004 ) , which implies that higher 354 concentration of alcohol and / or repeated cycles of binge and withdrawal are necessary for the 355 alcohol - dependent activation of Rac1 in the DMS . 356 To examine if Rac1 is activated in the DMS by a naturally rewarding substance , mice 357 underwent intermittent access to a 1 % sucrose 2 - bottle - choice paradigm for 2 weeks . We found 358 that Rac1 is not activated in the DMS of sucrose drinking mice ( Figure 2D , Table 1 ) ( Unpaired t - 359 test : t ( 12 ) = 0 . 5345 , p = 0 . 6028 ) , suggesting that activation of Rac1 signaling in the DMS is specific 360 for alcohol and is not shared with natural reward . Together , these data suggest that the activation 361 of Rac1 in the DMS observed after chronic alcohol consumption is not generalized to other closely 362 related small G - proteins in the Rho family , is specific to repeated cycles of binge and withdrawal 363 of a 20 % alcohol and is not shared with natural reward . 364 365 Alcohol promotes LIM kinase activation and cofilin phosphorylation 366 Rac1 activation leads to the downstream phosphorylation of LIMK which in turn 367 phosphorylates cofilin ( Edwards et al . , 1999 ) . Therefore , we examined whether alcohol - mediated 368 Rac1 stimulation promotes the activation of LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation in the DMS . To test 369 this question , we measured the level of LIMK phosphorylation , and thus activation , as well as the 370 phosphorylation of cofilin in the DMS after 7 weeks of IA20 % 2BC . We found that the 371 phosphorylation of both LIMK and cofilin were significantly increased after alcohol binge and 372 17 withdrawal in comparison to animals that drank water only ( Figure 3A - B , Table 1 ) ( One - way 373 ANOVA : LIMK F ( 2 , 12 ) = 96 . 40 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : Water vs . Binge p < 0 . 0001 , Water vs . 374 Withdrawal p < 0 . 0001 ; Cofilin F ( 2 , 12 ) = 44 . 14 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : Water vs . Binge p < 0 . 0001 , 375 Water vs . Withdrawal p < 0 . 0001 ) . Together , these data suggest that the long - term alcohol 376 consumption activates Rac1 - dependent signaling . 377 378 Alcohol activation of the LIMK / cofilin signaling pathway in the DMS depends on Rac1 379 The LIMK / cofilin signaling pathway can also be activated by other small G - proteins such 380 as RhoA / B , Cdc42 , and Rac3 ( Edwards et al . , 1999 ; Mira et al . , 2000 ; Swanson et al . , 2017 ) . 381 Thus , to confirm that the upregulation of LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation after excessive alcohol 382 use is indeed due to the increase in Rac1 activity , we used a dominant negative Rac1 mutant to 383 inhibit the activity of the endogenous protein . Specifically , the dominant negative mutant of Rac1 384 ( Rac1 - DN ) contains a threonine to asparagine substitution at residue 17 ( Worthylake et al . , 2000 ) . 385 The Rac1 mutant forms a tight complex with Rac1 - specific GEFs , but does not allow the exchange 386 of GDP to GTP , keeping the G - protein constantly inactive ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Wong et al . , 2006 ; 387 Zhang et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 4A ) . Rac1 - DN was packaged into an adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) . 388 First , to confirm the inhibitory action of Rac1 - DN , HEK293 cells were infected with AAV - Rac1 - DN 389 in media containing 1 % serum ( Extended Figure 2A ) . Next , cells were incubated for 30 minutes 390 with media containing 10 % FBS . As shown in Extended Figure 2C , incubation of cells with 10 % 391 FBS increased LIMK phosphorylation in non - infected cells , which was not observed in cells 392 infected with AAV - Rac1 - DN . In contrast , ERK1 / 2 whose phosphorylation does not depend on 393 Rac1 was increased by 10 % serum in both uninfected cells and AAV - Rac1 - DN infected cells . 394 These data suggest that AAV - Rac1 - DN selectively inhibits Rac1 signaling in cultured cells . 395 Next , mice were bilaterally infected with AAV - Rac1 - DN ( 3 . 5x10 12 vg / ml ) or an AAV - GFP 396 ( 3 . 5x10 12 vg / ml ) control in the DMS . As shown in Figure 4B and Extended Figure 2E - F , intense 397 and localized infection was detected in mice infected with AAV - Rac1 - DN . Global Rac1 protein 398 18 level was significantly increased in the DMS of mice infected with AAV - Rac1 - DN compared to 399 mice infected with AAV - GFP in mice drinking water or alcohol ( Extended Figure 2G ) ( Two - way 400 ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 20 ) = 69 . 58 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 6 . 774 , p = 0 . 0170 ; 401 Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 0 . 2164 , p = 0 . 6468 ; Post hoc W + AAV - GFP vs . W + AAV - Rac1 - 402 DN p < 0 . 0001 ; A + AAV - GFP vs . A + AAV - Rac1 - DN p = 0 . 0001 ) . 403 We then tested if Rac1 is required for alcohol - mediated LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation 404 in the DMS . Three weeks after surgery , mice underwent 7 weeks of IA20 % 2BC before dissection 405 ( Figure 4C ) . As described below , infection of the DMS of mice with AAV - GFP and AAV - Rac1 - DN 406 did not alter alcohol consumption ( Figure 8B ) , thus the DMS of mice infected with AAV - GFP or 407 AAV - Rac1 - DN were exposed to the same concentration of alcohol ( Table 1 ) . The phosphorylation 408 of LIMK and cofilin were measured in the DMS of water - or alcohol - drinking mice infected with 409 AAV - GFP or AAV - Rac1 - DN . We observed a significant increase in the phosphorylation of LIMK 410 and cofilin in AAV - GFP - infected animals during alcohol withdrawal ( Figure 4D - E , Table 1 ) ( Two - 411 way ANOVA : pLIMK Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 35 . 12 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : Water + AAV - GFP vs . 412 Alcohol + AAV - GFP p < 0 . 0001 ; pCofilin Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 380 . 5 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : 413 Water + AAV - GFP vs . Alcohol + AAV - GFP p < 0 . 0001 ) , which aligns with our prior results ( Figure 414 3A - B ) . AAV - Rac1 - DN overexpression had no effect on the phosphorylation of LIMK or cofilin in 415 water - drinking animals ( Two - way ANOVA : pLIMK Effect of virus F ( 1 , 20 ) = 58 . 01 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post 416 hoc : Water + AAV - GFP vs . Water + AAV - Rac1 - DN p = 0 . 3184 ; pCofilin Effect of virus F ( 1 , 20 ) = 378 . 8 , 417 p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : Water + AAV - GFP vs . Water + AAV - Rac1 - DN p = 0 . 9679 ) . In contrast , 418 overexpression of AAV - Rac1 - DN significantly reduced alcohol - mediated phosphorylation of LIMK 419 and cofilin ( Two - way ANOVA : pLIMK Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 105 . 1 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : 420 Alcohol + AAV - GFP vs . Alcohol + AAV - Rac1 - DN p < 0 . 0001 ; pCofilin Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 421 423 . 8 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : Alcohol + AAV - GFP vs . Alcohol + AAV - Rac1 - DN p < 0 . 0001 ) . These 422 results suggest that the molecular consequences of Rac1 stimulation by alcohol in the DMS is 423 19 the phosphorylation , and therefore activation , of LIMK and the phosphorylation of its substrate 424 cofilin . 425 426 Alcohol promotes F - actin formation in the DMS via Rac1 427 We previously showed that chronic excessive alcohol intake increases F - actin assembly 428 and decreases G - actin in the DMS ( Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) . Phosphorylated cofilin is unable to 429 cleave F - actin into G - actin ( Bamburg , 1999 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that the consequence 430 of the alcohol - mediated activation of the Rac1 / LIMK / cofilin signaling is the formation of F - actin . 431 To determine if actin remodeling in the DMS depends on Rac1 signaling , we examined the level 432 of F - actin and G - actin in the DMS of mice that underwent 7 weeks of IA20 % 2BC or water and 433 that were infected with AAV - GFP or AAV - Rac1 - DN ( Figure 5A , Table 1 ) . Similar to previous 434 findings ( Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) , control mice infected with AAV - GFP in the DMS had a 435 significantly higher level of F - actin after excessive chronic alcohol consumption in comparison to 436 AAV - GFP - infected mice that drank water only ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 101 . 6 , 437 p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : Water + AAV - GFP vs . Alcohol + AAV - GFP p < 0 . 0001 ) . Conversely , mice 438 infected with AAV - Rac1 - DN had a significantly lower F - actin content in comparison to AAV - GFP 439 mice both in the water - and alcohol - consuming groups ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 20 ) = 440 105 . 4 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc : Water + AAV - GFP vs . Water + AAV - Rac1 - DN p = 0 . 0199 ; Alcohol + AAV - 441 GFP vs . Alcohol + AAV - Rac1 - DN p < 0 . 0001 ) . In addition , the magnitude of the difference in F - actin 442 levels is greater between alcohol - drinking AAV - GFP and AAV - Rac1 - DN mice compared to water - 443 only animals ( Figure 5B , Table 1 ) ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 30 . 92 , 444 p < 0 . 0001 ) . Overexpression of AAV - Rac1 - DN had no effect on the level of G - actin in the water - 445 only group . However , G - actin levels were reduced by alcohol in mice infected with AAV - GFP , 446 which was rescued by overexpression of AAV - Rac1 - DN ( Figure 5B , Table 1 ) ( Two - way ANOVA : 447 Effect of virus F ( 1 , 20 ) = 7 . 585 , p = 0 . 0122 ; Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 12 . 30 , p = 0 . 0022 ; Effect of virus 448 x alcohol F ( 1 , 20 ) = 11 . 73 , p = 0 . 0027 ; Post hoc : Water + AAV - GFP vs . Alcohol + AAV - GFP p = 0 . 0005 ; 449 20 Water + AAV - Rac1 - DN vs . Alcohol + AAV - GFP p = 0 . 0016 ; Alcohol + AAV - GFP vs . Alcohol + AAV - 450 Rac1 - DN p = 0 . 0018 ) . Therefore , these data suggest that the alcohol - mediated increase in F - 451 actin assembly in the DMS depends on Rac1 . 452 453 Rac1 promotes the remodeling of dendritic arbors in the DMS 454 F - actin is responsible for morphological remodeling in neurons ( Honkura et al . , 2008 ; 455 Chazeau and Giannone , 2016 ; Costa et al . , 2020 ) . Previously , we showed that alcohol 456 consumption increases dendritic branch complexity in DMS medium spiny neurons ( MSNs ) 457 ( Wang et al . , 2015 ; Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) . Since alcohol reduces F - actin content via Rac1 , we 458 hypothesized that the increase in dendritic branching after alcohol use is mediated via Rac1 459 signaling . To test this possibility , the DMS of mice that were subjected to IA20 % 2BC or water only 460 was infected with a low titer ( 7x10 9 - 3 . 5x10 10 vg / ml ) of AAV - Rac1 - DN or AAV - GFP . The goal was 461 to infect a sparse population of neurons to allow for imaging of individual arbors ( Figure 6A - C ) . 462 Low - titer infection of Rac1 - DN did not alter alcohol consumption ( Table 1 ) . Sholl analysis ( Sholl , 463 1953 ) was then performed on the DMS of water - or alcohol - drinking mice infected with AAV - GFP 464 or AAV - Rac1 - DN . 465 Similar to our prior findings ( Wang et al . , 2015 ; Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) , we found that 466 alcohol significantly increased the complexity of dendritic trees of DMS MSNs ( Three - way 467 ANOVA : Effect of alcohol x distance F ( 1 , 1008 ) = 7 . 132 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . Specifically , DMS dendrites 30 - 468 9 0μm from the soma exhibited significantly more intersections in alcohol - drinking vs . water - only - 469 drinking mice ( Figure 6D ) ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 65 ) = 17 . 24 , p < 0 . 0001 , Post 470 hoc Šídák ' s multiple comparisons test ) . The increase in dendritic complexity was further quantified 471 by calculating the area under the curve ( AUC ) ( Figure 6E ) ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of alcohol 472 F ( 1 , 63 ) = 15 . 24 , p = 0 . 0002 ) . In addition , we observed that dendritic length ( Figure 6F ) , the number 473 of branching points ( Figure 6G ) , and the number of ending points ( Figure 6H ) , were also 474 significantly increased by alcohol ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of alcohol Dendritic Length F ( 1 , 63 ) = 475 21 16 . 92 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Branching points F ( 1 , 63 ) = 9 . 086 , p = 0 . 0037 ; Ending points F ( 1 , 63 ) = 11 . 48 , p = 476 0 . 0016 ) . 477 In contrast , infection of the DMS with AAV - Rac1 - DN significantly reduced dendritic 478 arborization ( Three - way ANOVA : Effect of virus x distance F ( 1 , 1008 ) = 6 . 462 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . 479 Specifically , the number of dendritic intersections 20 - 80μm from the soma was significantly 480 decreased when DMS neurons were infected with AAV - Rac1 - DN as compared to neurons 481 infected with AAV - GFP ( Figure 6D ) ( Two - way ANOVA of consolidated data : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 65 ) 482 = 15 . 59 , p = 0 . 0002 , Post hoc Šídák ' s multiple comparisons test of each Sholl diameter , 483 represented graphically ) . Furthermore , AAV - Rac1 - DN infection decreased AUC ( Figure 6E ) , 484 along with dendritic length , branching points , and ending points ( Figure 6F - H ) ( Two - way ANOVA : 485 Effect of virus AUC F ( 1 , 63 ) = 13 . 17 , p = 0 . 0006 , Dendritic length F ( 1 , 63 ) = 14 . 88 , p = 0 . 0002 , 486 Branching points F ( 1 , 63 ) = 11 . 94 , p = 0 . 0010 , Ending points F ( 1 , 63 ) = 16 . 35 , p = 0 . 0002 ) . However , 487 there was no interaction between the variables ( Three - way ANOVA : Effect of alcohol x virus x 488 distance F ( 1 , 1008 ) = 0 . 4689 , p = 0 . 9617 ; Two - way ANOVA : Effect of alcohol x virus AUC F ( 1 , 63 ) = 489 0 . 04500 , p = 0 . 8327 , Dendritic length F ( 1 , 63 ) = 0 . 01739 , p = 0 . 8955 , Branching points F ( 1 , 63 ) = 490 0 . 03059 , p = 0 . 8617 , Ending points F ( 1 , 63 ) = 0 . 2592 , p = 0 . 6125 ) . 491 Next , we examined the number of branches per dendritic order ( Figure 6I ) . Three - way 492 ANOVA showed a significant main effect of virus ( F ( 1 , 63 ) = 13 . 21 , p = 0 . 0006 ) and a significant main 493 effect of alcohol ( F ( 1 , 63 ) = 11 . 31 , p = 0 . 0013 ) but no interaction between virus and alcohol ( F ( 1 , 63 ) = 494 0 . 5889 , p = 0 . 4457 ) . The number of branches was then analyzed for each order and two - way 495 ANOVA showed a significant main effect of virus at 2 nd , 3 rd , and 5 th order ( represented 496 graphically ) , a significant main effect of alcohol at 3 rd , 4 th and 5 th order . 497 Together , these data confirmed that chronic excessive alcohol use significantly increases 498 the complexity of dendritic branching in DMS MSNs ( Wang et al . , 2015 ; Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) . 499 Importantly , we show that Rac1 contributes to dendritic branching in DMS neurons . 500 501 22 Rac1 in the DMS is required for the alcohol - mediated alteration in dendritic spine 502 morphology 503 Actin is the major structural protein in the post - synaptic density ( PSD ) ( Ratner and Mahler , 504 1983 ) . Actin cytoskeleton organization directly controls dendritic spine morphology ( Schubert and 505 Dotti , 2007 ; Hotulainen and Hoogenraad , 2010 ; Basu and Lamprecht , 2018 ) . Rac1 signaling 506 controls actin dynamics and is involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis ( Bosco et al . , 2009 ; 507 Haditsch et al . , 2009 ; Haditsch et al . , 2013 ; Costa et al . , 2020 ) . Since Rac1 is activated by alcohol 508 which in turn promotes F - actin assembly we hypothesized that the dendritic spines in the DMS 509 are altered by alcohol in a Rac1 - dependent manner . 510 Next , we examined the shape of individual dendritic spines on distal dendritic branches 511 ( 3 rd or 4 th order ) in mice infected with AAV - GFP and AAV - Rac1DN in DMS and that consumed 512 20 % alcohol or water only for 7 weeks ( Figure 7A ) . Spine density ( spine number per 10µm ) was 513 unaffected by alcohol drinking or AAV - Rac1 - DN infection ( Figure 7B ) ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect 514 of virus F ( 1 , 48 ) = 0 . 7175 , p = 0 . 4012 ; Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 2 . 541 , p = 0 . 1175 ; Effect of virus x 515 alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 0 . 2495 , p = 0 . 6197 ) . 516 We found that in control mice infected with AAV - GFP , alcohol drinking significantly 517 increased dendritic spine area , aligning with prior findings ( Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) ( Two - way 518 ANOVA : Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 36 . 24 , p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 7C ) . Alcohol drinking also 519 significantly increased dendritic spine volume ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 32 . 76 , 520 p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 7D ) . While spine length was unaffected by alcohol drinking ( Figure 7E ) , 521 average spine head width was increased ( Figure 7F ) ( Two - way ANOVA : Spine Length Effect of 522 alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 0 . 9881 , p = 0 . 5408 ; Head Width Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 18 . 81 , p < 0 . 0001 ) , which 523 led to a reduction in length - to - width ratio by alcohol ( Figure 7G ) ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of 524 alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 5 . 490 , p = 0 . 0233 ) . 525 In contrast , the alcohol - mediated alterations in dendritic spine morphology were 526 attenuated by Rac1 inhibition . Specifically , Rac1 inhibition significantly decreased dendritic spine 527 23 area in alcohol - drinking animals , without affecting water - only controls . ( Figure 7C ) ( Two - way 528 ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 48 ) = 12 . 98 , p = 0 . 0007 ; Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 12 . 52 , p = 529 0 . 0021 ; Post hoc Šídák ' s multiple comparisons test ) . The alcohol - mediated increase in dendritic 530 spine volume was also prevented by Rac1 - DN , without affecting water - only controls ( Figure 7D ) 531 ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 48 ) = 8 . 552 , p = 0 . 0053 ; Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 9 . 659 , 532 p = 0 . 0032 ; Post h oc Šídák ' s multiple comparisons test ) . In addition , we found that AAV - Rac1 - 533 DN slightly reduced spine length independent of drinking ( Figure 7E ) , and prevented the alcohol - 534 mediated increase in spine head width ( Figure 7F ) ( Two - way ANOVA : Spine Length Effect of 535 virus F ( 1 , 48 ) = 4 . 610 , p = 0 . 0369 ; Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 0 . 4081 , p = 0 . 5260 ; Head Width 536 Effect of virus F ( 1 , 48 ) = 3 . 408 , p = 0 . 0710 ; Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 6 . 734 , p = 0 . 0125 ; Post 537 hoc Šídák ' s multiple comparisons test ) . Finally , length - to - width ratio was unaffected by AAV - 538 Rac1 - DN infection ( Figure 7G ) ( Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 48 ) = 0 . 5552 , p = 0 . 4598 ; 539 Effect of virus x alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 1 . 939 , p = 0 . 1701 ; Post hoc Šídák ' s multiple comparisons test ) . 540 Together , these findings suggest that Rac1 contributes to the alcohol - mediated increases in 541 dendritic spine area , volume , and spine head width . 542 We then examined whether alcohol - mediated activation of Rac1 signaling and the 543 increase in F - actin content was responsible for the maturation of DMS MSN dendritic spines . 544 Dendritic spines are classed into four subtypes : filipodia , thin , stubby , and mushroom , with 545 filopodia being the least mature form of spines and mushrooms being the most mature form ( Kasai 546 et al . , 2003 ) . Spines are characterized by different shape , with primary variables being spine 547 length , neck , and head width ( Kasai et al . , 2003 ) . Like our previous study ( Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) , 548 we found that alcohol drinking increased the maturity of dendritic spines in the DMS . Specifically , 549 we found that in AAV - GFP infected mice , alcohol significantly increased the proportion of 550 mushroom - shaped spines at the expense of thin spines , while not affecting filopodia or stubby 551 spines ( Figure 7H ) . Rac1 inhibition blocked the alcohol - mediated increase in mushroom spines 552 and decrease in thin spines but had no effect on animals drinking water only ( Figure 7H ) ( Three - 553 24 way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 48 ) = 0 . 9904 , p = 0 . 3246 ; Effect of alcohol F ( 1 , 48 ) = 0 . 9904 , p = 554 0 . 3246 ; Spine type F ( 3 , 144 ) = 358 . 0 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Effect of virus x spine type F ( 3 , 144 ) = 14 . 80 , p < 555 0 . 0001 ; Effect of alcohol x spine type F ( 3 , 144 ) = 11 . 12 , p < 0 . 0001 , Effect of virus x alcohol x spine 556 type F ( 3 , 144 ) = 14 . 23 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Post hoc Šídák ' s multiple comparisons test ) . Together , our data 557 suggest that Rac1 signaling is responsible for the alcohol - mediated morphological changes in 558 dendritic spine structure and maturation in DMS MSNs . 559 560 Rac1 does not play a role in the development and maintenance of voluntary alcohol intake 561 Next , we set to determine if the alcohol - dependent , Rac1 - mediated molecular and cellular 562 changes have consequences on alcohol - related behaviors . First , we tested the effect of Rac1 563 inhibition on the development of excessive alcohol drinking . To do so , the DMS of mice was 564 bilaterally infused with AAV - Rac1 - DN or AAV - GFP ( 3 . 5x10 12 vg / ml ) . After allowing for three weeks 565 of recovery , animals underwent IA20 % 2BC for 7 weeks and drinking and preference were 566 measured ( Figure 8A ) . We found that there was no difference in alcohol consumption in the group 567 with overexpressed AAV - Rac1 - DN in the DMS compared to AAV - GFP controls ( Figure 8B ) ( RM 568 Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 17 ) = 0 . 08351 , p = 0 . 7761 ; Effect of session F ( 6 , 102 ) = 5 . 420 , p 569 < 0 . 0001 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 6 , 102 ) = 0 . 1339 , p = 0 . 9916 ) , and alcohol preference was also 570 unaltered ( Figure 8C ) ( RM Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 17 ) = 0 . 1798 , p = 0 . 6768 ; Effect of 571 session F ( 6 , 102 ) = 3 . 196 , p = 0 . 0065 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 6 , 102 ) = 0 . 4250 , p = 0 . 8608 ) . 572 Next , we determined the potential contribution of Rac1 to the maintenance of alcohol - 573 drinking behavior . Mice were first subjected to the IA20 % 2BC paradigm for 7 weeks . Experimental 574 and control groups were balanced based on drinking average . IA20 % 2BC was then resumed for 575 4 weeks ( Figure 8D ) . Overexpression of AAV - Rac1 - DN did not alter the maintenance of alcohol 576 drinking ( Figure 8E ) ( RM Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 14 ) = 2 . 454 , p = 0 . 1396 ; Effect of 577 session F ( 3 , 42 ) = 1 . 262 , p = 0 . 2998 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 3 , 42 ) = 0 . 5923 , p = 0 . 6235 ) or alcohol 578 25 preference ( Figure 8F ) ( RM Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 14 ) = 2 . 520 , p = 0 . 1347 ; Effect 579 of session F ( 3 , 42 ) = 0 . 7839 , p = 0 . 5096 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 3 , 42 ) = 0 . 7518 , p = 0 . 5275 ) . 580 Overexpression of AAV - Rac1 - DN did not alter water consumption in the development 581 ( Supp . Figure 3A ) or maintenance ( Supp . Figure 3B ) drinking experiments ( RM Two - way 582 ANOVA : Development Effect of virus F ( 1 , 17 ) = 0 . 4571 , p = 0 . 5081 ; Effect of session F ( 6 , 102 ) = 3 . 855 , 583 p = 0 . 0017 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 6 , 102 ) = 0 . 8631 , p = 0 . 5248 ; Maintenance Effect of virus F ( 1 , 13 ) 584 = 0 . 8287 , p = 0 . 3792 ; Effect of session F ( 3 , 39 ) = 3 . 606 , p = 0 . 0216 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 3 , 39 ) 585 = 0 . 1149 , p = 0 . 9508 ) Together , these results suggest that Rac1 in the DMS does not contribute 586 to the development or maintenance of voluntary alcohol drinking in the IA20 % 2BC paradigm . 587 588 Rac1 in the DMS is required for alcohol - associated goal - directed learning 589 We observed that the activation of Rac1 signaling after chronic excessive alcohol use was 590 specific to the DMS , a brain region that is associated with goal - directed learning ( Dolan and 591 Dayan , 2013 ; Shan et al . , 2014 ) . As goal - directed behavior is particularly important for drug 592 seeking ( Singer et al . , 2018 ) , we hypothesized that Rac1 in the DMS may play a role in alcohol - 593 associated goal - directed learning . 594 To examine this hypothesis , the DMS of mice was bilaterally infused with AAV - Rac1 - DN 595 or AAV - GFP ( 3 . 5x10 12 vg / ml ) . Mice were allowed 3 weeks to recover before undergoing 596 IA20 % 2BC for 7 weeks . Mice were then trained to self - administer 20 % alcohol on a fixed ratio of 597 reinforcement 1 ( FR1 ) schedule for 20 hours over four sessions during the first week before 598 transitioning to 2 - hour sessions . After eight 2 - hour sessions of FR1 , mice progressed to FR2 , and 599 alcohol - associated active lever presses and inactive lever presses were examined ( Figure 9A ) . 600 We found that there was no significant change in active lever presses between mice infected with 601 AAV - Rac1 - DN or AAV - GFP ( Figure 9B , Table 1 ) ( RM Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 13 , 143 ) 602 = 1 . 522 , p = 0 . 1163 ; Effect of session F ( 3 . 043 , 33 . 47 ) = 1 . 232 , p = 0 . 3137 ; Effect of virus x session 603 F ( 13 , 143 ) = 1 . 522 , p = 0 . 1163 ) . However , mice infected with AAV - Rac1 - DN pressed the inactive 604 26 lever significantly more than the AAV - GFP - infected mice ( Figure 9C ) ( RM Two - way ANOVA : 605 Effect of virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 5 . 102 , p = 0 . 0452 ; Effect of session F ( 13 , 143 ) = 0 . 9024 , p = 0 . 5522 ; Effect of 606 virus x session F ( 13 , 143 ) = 0 . 8569 , p = 0 . 5996 ) . This phenotype is exemplified in the discrimination 607 index , showing that the AAV - Rac1 - DN mice exhibited significantly worse discrimination for the 608 active lever throughout the OSA experiment in comparison to AAV - GFP controls ( Figure 9D ) ( RM 609 Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 5 . 320 , p = 0 . 0415 ; Effect of session F ( 13 , 143 ) = 2 . 237 , p 610 = 0 . 0107 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 13 , 143 ) = 0 . 8674 , p = 0 . 5886 ) . A similar phenotype was 611 observed in the proportion of rewarded lever presses , which accounts for active lever presses 612 that do not lead to a reward . Specifically , while over 50 % of presses of the AAV - GFP control 613 animals led to a reward , the AAV - Rac1 - DN group failed to reach this threshold throughout the 614 testing period ( Figure 9E ) ( RM Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 16 . 66 , p = 0 . 0018 , Effect 615 of session F ( 13 , 143 ) = 6 . 400 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 13 , 143 ) = 0 . 5518 , p = 0 . 8880 ) . 616 There was no difference in alcohol consumption between groups ( Figure 9F ) ( RM Two - way 617 ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 1 . 099 , p = 0 . 3169 ; Effect of session F ( 13 , 143 ) = 15 . 18 , p < 0 . 0001 ; 618 Effect of virus x session F ( 13 , 143 ) = 1 . 156 , p = 0 . 3178 ) , which aligns with the IA20 % 2BC data 619 ( Figure 7B , 7E ) . Examination of the inter - response interval between lever presses of the final 620 session shows that AAV - Rac1 - DN mice exhibited a significantly increased proportion of lever 621 presses in short intervals , and significantly less lever presses in the longer intervals , compared to 622 AAV - GFP controls ( Figure 9G ) ( RM Two - way ANOVA : Effect of virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 0 . 5360 , p = 0 . 4794 ; 623 Effect of interval F ( 4 , 44 ) = 64 . 48 , p < 0 . 0001 ; Effect of virus x interval F ( 4 , 44 ) = 6 . 145 , p = 0 . 0005 ; 624 Post hoc 0 - 5 p = 0 . 0034 , > 20 p < 0 . 001 ) . These phenotypes can be visualized in the behavioral 625 trace of individual mouse profiles from the OSA session with the greatest discrimination difference 626 ( Figure 9H ) . These data suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays a role in alcohol - associated , goal - 627 directed learning . As the DMS plays an important role in movement ( Kravitz and Kreitzer , 2012 ) , 628 we examined the consequence of Rac1 inhibition in the DMS on locomotion using an open field 629 27 paradigm . As shown in Figure 9l , attenuation of Rac1 activity in the DMS had no effect on 630 locomotion ( Unpaired t - test : t ( 16 ) = 0 . 06783 , p = 0 . 9468 ) . 631 632 Rac1 in the DMS is not required for sucrose goal - directed learning 633 Alcohol is often distinct from natural reward ( Alhadeff et al . , 2019 ; Nall et al . , 2021 ; Martins 634 et al . , 2022 ) , and Rac1 in the DMS is not activated in response to sucrose consumption ( Figure 635 2D ) . We hypothesized that Rac1 in the DMS does not play a role in sucrose - dependent goal 636 directed learning . To test this hypothesis , the DMS of mice was first bilaterally infused with AAV - 637 Rac1 - DN or AAV - GFP ( 3 . 5x10 12 vg / ml ) and age - matched to the alcohol OSA group . The mice 638 were then trained to operant self - administer 1 % sucrose , initially starting with an FR1 639 reinforcement schedule for 20 hours of training over four sessions before transitioning to 2 - hour 640 sessions . After 8 2 - hour sessions of FR1 , mice were advanced to an FR2 schedule ( Figure 10A ) . 641 We observed no difference between mice with AAV - Rac1 - DN and AAV - GFP overexpression in 642 active lever pressing ( Figure 10B ) , inactive lever pressing ( Figure 10C ) , discrimination ( Figure 643 10D ) , or proportion of rewarded lever presses ( Figure 10E ) ( RM Two - way ANOVA : 10B Effect of 644 virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 4 . 651 , p = 0 . 0540 ; Effect of session F ( 3 . 905 , 42 . 36 ) = 5 . 335 , p = 0 . 0015 ; Effect of virus x 645 session F ( 13 , 141 ) = 0 . 9458 , p = 0 . 5079 ; 10C Effect of virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 0 . 2087 , p = 0 . 6566 ; Effect of 646 session F ( 2 . 224 , 24 . 12 ) = 0 . 8833 , p = 0 . 4364 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 13 , 141 ) = 0 . 6457 , p = 0 . 8119 ; 647 10D Effect of virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 0 . 007081 , p = 0 . 9344 ; Effect of session F ( 3 . 161 , 34 . 29 ) = 1 . 888 , p = 0 . 1475 ; 648 Effect of virus x session F ( 13 , 141 ) = 0 . 7552 , p = 0 . 7057 ; 10E Effect of virus F ( 1 , 11 ) = 0 . 0001974 , p = 649 0 . 9890 ; Effect of session F ( 3 . 512 , 38 . 10 ) = 6 . 534 , p = 0 . 0007 ; Effect of virus x session F ( 13 , 141 ) = 0 . 7314 , 650 p = 0 . 7298 ) . These data suggest that Rac1 in the DMS does not affect learning of natural - reward - 651 associated goal - directed behavior and that the learning deficiency exhibited by AAV - Rac1 - DN 652 overexpression in the DMS is specific to alcohol - associated goal - directed learning . 653 654 655 28 Discussion 656 We show herein that Rac1 signaling is activated in the DMS in response to long term 657 excessive alcohol drinking of male mice . We further show that the consequences of alcohol - 658 mediated Rac1 / LIMK signaling in the DMS are the formation of F - actin and the alteration of 659 dendritic spine morphology . Finally , we present data to suggest that Rac1 in the DMS plays a role 660 in alcohol - associated goal - directed learning . Together , our results suggest that Rac1 in the DMS 661 plays an important role in molecular and morphological adaptations that promote alcohol - 662 dependent learning behavior . 663 664 Rac1 is activated in the DMS after alcohol consumption 665 We found that Rac1 signaling is activated specifically in the DMS of male mice in response 666 to long - term drinking of alcohol which was observed during the 4 - hour binge drinking session and 667 was still detected after 24 hours of withdrawal . The mechanism by which alcohol activates Rac1 668 in the DMS is unknown , and the sequence of events is unclear , e . g . is the binge or withdrawal 669 session that initiates the activation of Rac1 ? Rac1 is activated by NMDA receptor stimulation in 670 rat cortical and hippocampal neurons ( Tolias et al . , 2005 ; Xiao et al . , 2013 ) . Previously , we found 671 that ex vivo and in vivo exposure to , and withdrawal from , alcohol induces long - term facilitation of 672 GluN2B - containing NMDA receptor activity specifically in the DMS ( Wang et al . , 2007 ; Wang et 673 al . , 2010 ) . Glutamatergic tone is increased in cortical regions that project to the striatum of 674 humans and rats during acute alcohol withdrawal ( Hermann et al . , 2012 ; Hwa et al . , 2017 ) . 675 Therefore , it is very plausible that Rac1 is first activated during withdrawal through the activation 676 of GluN2B receptors in the DMS , and that its activity is maintained during the alcohol drinking 677 session . The long - lasting activation of Rac1 in the DMS in response to alcohol could be due to 678 increased level and / or activity of one or both of its specific GEFs , Tiam1 and / or Karilin - 7 ( Tolias 679 et al . , 2005 ; Xie et al . , 2007 ) or because of a reduction of the level and / or activity of its specific 680 GAP ( Toure et al . , 1998 ; Garcia - Mata et al . , 2006 ; Peru et al . , 2012 ; Nakamura , 2013 ) . Another 681 29 plausible explanation for alcohol - mediated Rac1 activation in the DMS is that withdrawal from 682 IA20 % 2BC might trigger activation of a DMS - specific circuit by activating only neurons projecting 683 to the DMS . For example , Ma et al . found an increase in glutamatergic transmission from mPFC 684 neurons projecting to the DMS in alcohol but not water drinking rats ( Ma et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , 685 chronic IA20 % 2BC drinking was shown to alter instrumental learning by affecting the thalamus - 686 to - DMS circuit ( Ma et al . , 2022 ) . Further work is required to unravel the specificity of inputs and 687 its interaction with alcohol . 688 Furthermore , ~ 95 % of the DMS MSNs express either dopamine D1 receptor - ( D1 ) or 689 dopamine D2 receptor ( Gerfen and Surmeier , 2011 ; Calabresi et al . , 2014 ; Cheng et al . , 2017 ) . 690 Alcohol increases the complexity of dendritic branching and maturation of dendritic spines 691 selectively in D1 but not D2 DMS MSNs ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . Since the inhibition of endogenous 692 Rac1 attenuates alcohol - dependent re - structuring of DMS MSNs , we speculate that alcohol - 693 mediated Rac1 signaling is specifically localized to D1 neurons . This possibility will be determined 694 in future studies . 695 Interestingly , we did not detect Rac1 activation in response to alcohol drinking in the DMS 696 of female mice . While Rac1 is not activated in the DMS of female mice in response to alcohol 697 drinking , this does not exclude Rac1 from being activated by alcohol in other brain regions , such 698 as the amygdala or hippocampus , where Rac1 is involved in learning and memory ( Martinez et 699 al . , 2007 ; Haditsch et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2014 ; Gao et al . , 2015 ) . Further investigation is required 700 to unravel the mechanisms controlling sex - specificity in Rac1 signaling . 701 702 Rac1 in the DMS promotes alcohol - dependent morphological adaptations 703 We previously showed that the complexity of dendritic branching is increased by alcohol 704 ( Wang et al . , 2015 ; Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) . Here , we replicated the data of both studies and 705 showed that Rac1 is responsible for DMS MSNs dendritic complexity . However , because Rac1 - 706 DN significantly decreased dendritic arborization in both water and alcohol drinking animals , we 707 30 cannot definitely conclude that Rac1 contributes to alcohol - dependent alteration of dendritic tree 708 complexity , but based on the finding that Rac1 inhibition significantly alters F - actin content , this 709 possibility is highly likely . 710 Rac1 is involved in the maturation and morphogenesis of dendritic spines ( Nakayama et 711 al . , 2000 ; Tashiro et al . , 2000 ; Pennucci et al . , 2019 ; Costa et al . , 2020 ) . In addition to the DMS , 712 ( Wang et al . , 2015 ; Laguesse et al . , 2018 ) and data herein , alcohol exposure affects dendritic 713 spine morphology in cortical regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) ( Cannady et 714 al . , 2021 ) , and the OFC ( McGuier et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , it is plausible that the activation of Rac1 715 may also be the molecular mediator of alcohol - dependent structural plasticity in cortical regions . 716 Interestingly , Rac1 was reported to play a role in cocaine - dependent neuroadaptations in 717 other striatal regions . Specifically , Dietz et al . reported that cocaine - dependent increase in NAc 718 thin spine density was mediated by Rac1 ( Dietz et al . , 2012 ) , whereas Li et al . showed that the 719 cocaine - dependent increase of Rac1 signaling in the dorsal striatum leads to dendritic spine 720 maturation ( Li et al . , 2015 ) . Cocaine also increases actin cycling through LIMK / cofilin signaling in 721 the NAc ( Toda et al . , 2006 ) . Tu et al . observed that decreased Rac1 signaling is required for 722 METH - mediated spine density and maturation in the NAc ( Tu et al . , 2019 ) . Here , the increase in 723 dendritic maturation after alcohol drinking in the DMS is shown to be Rac1 - dependent . These 724 findings suggest that drugs of abuse are altering Rac1 signaling in a drug - and subregion - 725 dependent manner . 726 727 Rac1 and alcohol - associated behaviors 728 We found that Rac1 in the DMS does not play a role in voluntary drinking behavior . It is 729 not unusual that alcohol - mediated signaling controls a specific behavior without affecting 730 voluntary drinking . For example , inhibition of mTORC1 activity in the orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) 731 attenuates habitual alcohol seeking without affecting IA20 % 2BC consumption ( Morisot et al . , 732 2019 ) . Furthermore , lack of toll - like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) does not alter ethanol consumption or 733 31 preference ( Blednov et al . , 2017a ) , but does significantly reduce the duration of loss of righting 734 reflex and recovery from alcohol - induced motor incoordination ( Blednov et al . , 2017b ) . Although 735 Rac1 signaling in the DMS does not mediate voluntary drinking behavior , its activation may be 736 involved in other alcohol - related behaviors . 737 The DMS primarily mediates goal - directed behaviors ( Yin et al . , 2005 ; Balleine and 738 O ' Doherty , 2010 ; Everitt and Robbins , 2013 ; Gremel and Costa , 2013 ) , which play a major role 739 in the addiction cycle ( Hogarth , 2020 ) . Here , Rac1 inhibition in the DMS impaired active lever 740 discrimination and led to a reduction in the proportion of lever presses leading to a reward , 741 implying a failure to learn the association between an active lever press and alcohol reward . The 742 increase in inactive lever presses is unlikely to have resulted from increased locomotor activity , 743 as Rac1 inhibition did not affect locomotion . Interestingly , this learning deficit is specific for 744 alcohol , as Rac1 inhibition in the DMS did not affect the learning of active lever association with 745 sucrose reward . This phenotype could be the result of disrupting the Rac1 signaling reinforcing 746 active lever preference ( “GO” ) or the avoidance of undesired action ( “N o - GO” ) ( Cheng et al . , 747 2017 ) . The normal physiological role of Rac1 in the DMS is unknown . Rac1 has been linked with 748 learning and memory in other regions such as the hippocampus , where it is required for spatial 749 learning ( Haditsch et al . , 2009 ) . Rac1 in the hippocampus also mediates reversible forgetting ( Lv 750 et al . , 2019 ) , contributing to the long - term maintenance of memory behaviors like contextual - fear 751 conditioning and object recognition ( Lv et al . , 2019 ) . Further work is required to investigate Rac1’s 752 role in goal - directed behavior . 753 To our knowledge , this is the first study unveiling a molecular mechanism involved in 754 alcohol - specific goal - directed learning . Prior studies have investigated the mechanisms of goal - 755 directed learning in the context of food and sucrose seeking in the rodent striatum ( Hart et al . , 756 2018 ; Matamales et al . , 2020 ; Peak et al . , 2020 ) . For example , using chemogenetics , Peak et al . 757 found that D1R MSNs in the posterior DMS were critical for sucrose goal - directed learning ( Peak 758 et al . , 2020 ) , and Matamales et al . have shown that striatal - dependent goal - directed learning for 759 32 food involves ensembles of D1R MSNs , controlled and modified by D2R MSNs ( Matamales et al . , 760 2020 ) . It is tempting to speculate that specific sucrose or alcohol ensembles exist within the DMS . 761 With Rac1 signaling contributing to alcohol but not sucrose self - administration , our results provide 762 support to the notion that natural reward and alcohol drug reward mechanisms are different 763 ( Alhadeff et al . , 2019 ) . 764 In summary , in this study we unraveled that alcohol drinking increases Rac1 signaling in 765 the DMS , leading to the alcohol - mediated maturation of dendritic spines , which is important for 766 the goal - directed behavior learning process . As goal - directed behavior is a major contributor to 767 the cycle of addiction ( Hogarth , 2020 ) , it is likely that the maladaptive activation of Rac1 768 contributes to the progression of AUD . 769 33 Author Contributions : DR conceived the project .
