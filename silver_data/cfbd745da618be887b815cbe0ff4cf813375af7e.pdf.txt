Scaffolding CS1 Courses with a Large Language Model - Powered Intelligent Tutoring System Chen Cao ccao5 @ sheffield . ac . uk University of Sheffield United Kingdom ABSTRACT Programming skills are rapidly becoming essential for many ed - ucational paths and career opportunities . Yet , for many interna - tional students , the traditional approach to teaching introductory programming courses can be a significant challenge due to the com - plexities of the language , the lack of prior programming knowledge , and the language and cultural barriers . This study explores how large language models and gamification can scaffold coding learning and increase Chinese students’ sense of belonging in introductory programming courses . In this project , a gamification intelligent tutoring system was developed to adapt to Chinese international students’ learning needs and provides scaffolding to support their success in introductory computer programming courses . My research includes three studies : a formative study , a user study of an initial prototype , and a computer simulation study with a user study in progress . Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through surveys , observations , focus group discussions and computer simulation . The preliminary findings suggest that GPT - 3 - enhanced gamification has great potential in scaffolding introductory programming learning by providing adaptive and personalised feedback , increasing students’ sense of belonging , and reducing their anxiety about learning programming .

Consequently , the importance of programming knowledge and coding skills has grown signifi - cantly in recent years . Introductory programming courses , often referred to as computer science 1 ( CS1 ) courses are designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming and coding [ 4 ] . However , these courses can be challenging for many interna - tional students , who may lack prior programming expertise and are confronted with a language and cultural barriers [ 12 ] .

Despite the clear benefits of international student enrollment , Chinese inter - national students can often feel isolated in their new environment and struggle to integrate into university life [ 6 ] . In the context of programming education , Chinese international students often face hardship due to a lack of prior exposure to coding concepts and language [ 2 ] . As a result , they are more likely to experience anxiety and a feeling of low belonging . However , previous research showed bias and stereotypes when describing Chinese students’ learning behaviours in global higher education [ 11 ] . Chinese international students are often perceived as passive and reluctant learners when adapting to British educational systems [ 19 ] . This stereotype , how - ever , fails to take into account the cultural and educational factors driving these behaviours . At the same time , gamification has seen a surge in popularity in the educational sector . It has been used as a tool to engage students and encourage learning in a range of contexts [ 18 ] . This presents an opportunity to investigate the potential of gamification to scaffold coding learning and increase the sense of belonging among Chinese international students in introductory programming courses . Ad - ditionally , the use of educational technologies , such as intelligent tutoring systems in educational settings has been growing steadily in recent years , as an increasing number of educators recognize the potential of this approach to engage and motivate learners [ 16 ] . An intelligent tutoring system is particularly attractive due to its ability to personalise the learning experience , offering tailored ac - tivities to meet the needs of diverse learners [ 15 ] . In addition , an intelligent tutoring system can provide feedback in a timely and effective manner , offering learners the opportunity to improve their skills in a supportive and engaging environment [ 3 ] . The research background of this thesis is rooted in the idea that AI - enhanced gamification can be used to scaffold learning and increase belonging among Chinese international students in intro - ductory programming courses . AI - enhanced gamification combines the use of gamification techniques with AI - driven intelligent tu - toring systems to create a personalised learning experience . This approach encourages learners to engage in the learning process and offers them the opportunity to practise and improve their coding skills in a supportive and engaging environment . This research is motivated by the need to bridge the gaps in pro - gramming knowledge between Chinese international students and their domestic peers . It is also driven by the urgent need to create an inclusive learning environment that is accessible and welcoming to all students . The research findings could have a considerable impact on the teaching and learning of programming for Chinese international students . It has the potential to provide insight into 229 IUI ’23 Companion , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia Chen Cao how AI - enhanced gamification can be used to make the learning process easier and more effective for these students , as well as to foster a sense of belonging . The findings could inform instructors , administrators , and policymakers of the most effective strategies for teaching and learning to program for this population . This study can also be expanded to support other underrepresented student groups ( such as female STEM students and other international stu - dents from different countries and cohorts ) who also need a sense of belonging to their peers , faculty , and subject - related careers . 2 RESEARCH AIM AND QUESTIONS The main focus of this research project is to explore the potential of AI - enhanced gamification to scaffold coding learning and increase the sense of belonging among Chinese international students in introductory programming courses . Specifically , the focus will be on designing , evaluating , and refining the use of AI - enhanced gam - ification to improve learning outcomes and increase motivation among Chinese international students in introductory program - ming courses . The research project is framed within the context of design - based research , which emphasises the importance of designing , implementing , and evaluating a learning environment , with the goal of optimising the learning experience . The research project is guided by two research questions : • RQ1 : what are the challenges that Chinese international stu - dents are facing regarding developing a sense of belonging and code learning in introductory programming courses ? • RQ2 : how can AI and gamification be used to scaffold coding learning and increase the sense of belonging among Chi - nese international students in introductory programming courses ? 3 RELATED WORK This research is situated within the larger context of educational technology and game - based learning . The use of technology in education has become increasingly popular , with a growing number of educators recognising the potential of this approach to engage and motivate learners [ 16 ] . This study specifically focuses on the application of AI - enhanced gamification to scaffold coding learning among Chinese international students . There has been a considerable amount of research examining the challenges and barriers associated with teaching introductory programming courses , e . g . [ 1 ] . These studies have highlighted the need for more effective pedagogical approaches to engage learn - ers in CS1 courses . Several researchers have proposed the use of game - based learning techniques such as serious games and simula - tions to increase engagement and motivation among students [ 13 ] . Gamification combines elements of gaming ( e . g . , points , rewards , leaderboards ) with traditional educational activities to create an engaging learning experience . The use of intelligent tutoring systems ( ITS ) in programming education has also been studied extensively . Research has shown that ITS can improve student performance and reduce cognitive load in programming courses . For example , Grenander et al . [ 10 ] proposed an AI - enhanced educational system that was designed to provide personalised feedback based on individual learners’ needs and evaluated its effectiveness using deep discourse analysis . Simi - larly , Eguchi [ 9 ] investigated the use of AI - enhanced games to sup - port STEM education for children with visual impairments . They found that the AI - enhanced game had a positive impact on engage - ment and motivation among participants . Furthermore , ITS can provide personalised instruction and targeted remediation , which can be particularly beneficial for those who lack prior experience in programming . In particular , GPT - 3 ( Generative Pre - trained Trans - former 3 ) , an advanced language model developed by OpenAI , has been used to improve the performance of ITSs by providing natural language understanding capabilities [ 17 ] . This research project is also informed by recent studies on be - longing in higher education . It has been argued that belonging is an important factor when it comes to understanding and support - ing the learning experiences of international students [ 7 ] . Studies have also shown that international students often face difficulties in developing a sense of belonging due to language and cultural barriers [ 5 ] . 4 RESEARCH METHOD This research project applies design - based research ( DBR ) as its methodological approach . DBR is an iterative process that empha - sises the importance of designing , implementing , and evaluating educational technology to optimise the learning experience . This approach has been widely used in educational settings to investigate the effectiveness of new technologies and approaches in engaging and motivating learners . The use of DBR provides a unique opportu - nity to combine theoretical insights with practical implementation to create meaningful interventions that are responsive to the needs of diverse learners . The research is divided into three phases : 1 ) a survey to identify Chinese students’ needs and the challenges they met regarding a sense of belonging and learning experience in introductory pro - gramming courses ; 2 ) a design probe with a story - based gamifica - tion prototype to increase Chinese students’ sense of belonging and improve their learning experience in CS1 courses with user evaluation ; 3 ) the development and systematic evaluations of an intelligent tutoring system leveraging large language model and gamification features for CS1 courses . The study used a mixed - methods approach , incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data . The quantitative data were col - lected through a survey measuring students’ sense of belonging , academic performance , and academic emotions , and a computer simulation study evaluating the performances of the ITS . The qual - itative data were collected through participatory observations and focus group interviews to explore students’ experiences and per - ceptions in more depth . The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics , thematic analysis , and computational analysis . 5 PRELIMINARY RESULTS 5 . 1 Study 1 : Formative study The initial survey was conducted as a formative study in the first se - mester of the 21 / 22 academic year . Based on the questionnaire with 57 Chinese international students and in - depth interviews with nine of them , the study found a number of unique challenges faced by the participants in the CS1 courses . Chinese students generally 230 Scaffolding CS1 Courses with a Large Language Model - Powered Intelligent Tutoring System IUI ’23 Companion , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia found it difficult to cope with the demands of the programming course . A number of factors were identified as contributing to this difficulty , including the challenges to adapt to new teaching methods emphasizing independent thinking , critical thinking , and innovative learning ; less interaction with teachers and classmates ; disconnection between the knowledge and real - life cases and not receiving enough academic support with timely help and real - time feedback . As a result , they have low engagement in classes , low re - tention and negative academic emotions . One of the key factors that have been identified as contributing to these unsmooth academic transition experiences is a lack of intrinsic motivation , especially a lack of sense of belonging . 5 . 2 Study 2 : A prototype of story - based ITS The second study designed , deployed and evaluated a prototype of a story - based gamification design on a learning management system Blackboard . Based on the initial findings from the survey , the prototype adopted a set of gamification features , including animated trailers , story - telling , role - play , teamwork , points , leaderboards and feedback . The study was conducted over a period of two weeks with a total of 34 Chinese students enrolled in the introductory programming course INF6032 Big Data Analytics , which is one of the core modules of the MSc in Data Science programme at the University of Sheffield . The practical session in week 6 was set in the context of airline companies’ survival during the pandemic . In week 7 , the story was about solving a criminal case . The narrative storytelling of each session with real - life cases was designed to make students feel more connected to the programme . The findings from questionnaires ( n = 32 ) , focus groups ( n = 32 ) and participatory observation revealed that Chinese students generally had positive perceptions of the effect of story - based gamification design on their sense of belonging in the introductory programming course . The majority of students reported feeling more motivated to learn , more engaged in the course , and more connected to their classmates as a result of the story - based gamification design . In addition , the findings suggested that story - based gamification de - sign had a positive effect on Chinese students’ sense of belonging in the introductory programming course . Most students reported feeling a greater sense of belonging in the course after the story - based gamification design was implemented . It was also found that Chinese students have some unique cultural needs which should be considered in the story - based gamification design . These findings suggest that story - based gamification design can be an effective means of improving Chinese students’ sense of belonging in the introductory programming course . 5 . 3 Study 3 : A model of the story - based ITS empowered by GPT - 3 The reflection upon the findings from the previous study encour - aged the development of the current model of the story - based in - telligent tutoring system ( ITS ) . The ITS empowered by GPT - 3 was designed to better fit the needs of individual learners , and increase their sense of belonging to the class , institution and career - related subject , in order to further foster inclusion in higher education . The design of the user interface is inspired by the English TV series Sherlock with abundant modern English elements , which is ideal to engage international students coming to the UK for higher education . The user interface of the ITS was built on a popular open - source template 1 in React , a mainstream JavaScript library for developing front - ends . The overall design principles of the web app are inspired by the famous detective , Sherlock Holmes . The colour scheme , typography and navigation are all based on the idea of the Mind Palace , with a focus on the dark blue and white colours to convey a feeling of sophistication and intelligence . The development of the learning system consists of four main components : the instructional content , the gamification mecha - nism design , the user interface , and the generative language model . The learning content consists of the introduction of programming knowledge , demo explanations and exercises to provide the learning materials to the users . The game engine was designed to provide a fun and engaging learning experience . It consisted of a set of gamification elements , including alternative reality , points , badges , personalized feedback and encouragements , levels and challenges , an avatar , a progress bar and an exploratory word cloud . The user interface is responsible for displaying the learning content and gamification mechanisms to the users and accepting user input . The generative language model is used for providing AI capabilities such as Q & A and explaining code to the system . The system is designed to be a web - based application . It consists of three main components , which are the front end , the back end and the GPT - 3 platform . The front end used React library to develop the user interface and enable interactions . The back end is responsible for data storage , processing and retrieval . In this system , Firebase is applied to connect with the interface and synchronise data . All the states ( user behaviours and inputs ) in the front end were centralised with Redux and synchronised to Firebase , where all the user data , such as the user’s avatar , learning progress and chat history with the AI conversational agents were stored for further analysis . GPT - 3 was used in this system to train the AI model for the intelligent agents . The agents were designed to interact with the users , and provide guidance and support throughout the learning process . In addition , the agents were also responsible for marking the user’s progress and giving feedback . There were four chatbots providing support to students with different functions , including the intelligent tutoring bot Sherlock , the peer and critical thinking bot Watson , the career engagement bot Inspector Lestrade and the emotion support bot Mrs Hudson . When the student asked a ques - tion , Sherlock answered it first . Then Watson , Inspector Lestrade and Mrs Hudson generated follow - up questions to continue the conversation , in order to foster inquiry - based learning and improve students’ computational thinking and understanding of job market needs . In the interface of marking and feedback , students can submit the codes for quizzes and get real - time and tailored feedback about their answers . The model first extracts the code snippet from the user input and then generates an explanation for the code snippet by calling the GPT - 3 API with the code snippet and a prompt as input . The prompt is a natural language question that can be used to generate an explanation for the code snippet . The code - explaining module uses a set of predefined prompts to generate explanations 1 Bootstrap4UIkit , https : / / demos . creative - tim . com / now - ui - kit - react / # / index ? ref = nukr - github - readme 231 IUI ’23 Companion , March 27 – 31 , 2023 , Sydney , NSW , Australia Chen Cao for the code snippets . The prompts are selected to cover a wide range of programming concepts . A computer simulation study and a pilot user study were con - ducted to evaluate the ITS . By using prompt programming , a dataset containing 360 rounds of simulated questions that students may ask in the class and answers were simulated based on the learning objectives and instructors’ reflections . The findings from semantic similarity analysis , topic modelling and sentiment analysis indi - cated that GPT - 3 empowered agents performed well in providing feedback and having insightful conversations , but the quality of answers depend on the form and level of the questions . The ITS was also piloted with different stakeholders , including potential users , instructors , practitioners and researchers to assess the usability , ac - ceptability and effectiveness of the system . Findings from the pilot study indicated that the system performs well in terms of usability and acceptability . Most participants reported feeling positive about their experience with the intelligent tutoring system , with many saying they were impressed and felt supported by the AI agents . They also commented positively on the gamification elements in the system , such as the intriguing storyline of Sherlock . 6 IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE WORK The current studies suggested that GPT - 3 as a large language model trained on a vast amount of text data is particularly well - suited to answering questions at the remembering and understanding levels of Bloom’s taxonomy . These levels involve recalling and comprehending information , which is a strength of large language models like GPT - 3 . IT also performed well in answering questions at the higher levels of the taxonomy , such as analysis , synthesis , and evaluation if the questions are well - formed . Generally , GPT - 3’s ability to answer questions in the educational scenario of CS1 courses is promising but limited by its lack of domain - specific knowledge and expertise . Despite the promising results of this study , there are still a num - ber of areas for further research and development . Firstly , more detailed studies should be conducted to investigate the long - term impact of AI - enhanced gamification on students’ learning outcomes and sense of belonging in introductory programming courses . Sec - ondly , contextual factors such as culture , language and prior knowl - edge should be taken into account when designing AI - enhanced gamification systems to better support Chinese international stu - dents . Thirdly , more sophisticated machine learning models can be explored to improve the performance of AI agents . Finally , more user studies need to be conducted to explore how AI - enhanced gam - ification can be used to foster collaboration among team members , reduce anxiety and facilitate learning transfer . In order to fully realize the potential of the GPT - 3 enhanced ITS to increase student sense of belonging in higher education , more research must be conducted in real educational scenarios . More user studies are needed to assess how GPT - 3 affects student aca - demic performance , motivation , and sense of belonging . In addition , researchers must continue to refine GPT - 3’s capabilities to improve the ITS’s ability to pick up on subtle social cues and to develop a better understanding of student emotions and motivations .
