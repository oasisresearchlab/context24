Human P - selectin glycoprotein ligand - 1 is a functional receptor for enterovirus 71 Yorihiro Nishimura 1 , Masayuki Shimojima 2 , Yoshio Tano 1 , 3 , Tatsuo Miyamura 1 , Takaji Wakita 1 & Hiroyuki Shimizu 1 Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) is a major causative agent of hand , foot and mouth disease ( HFMD ) , a common febrile disease occurring mainly in young children . Although clinical manifestations of HFMD are usually mild and self limiting , a severe EV71 outbreak can lead to a diverse array of neurological diseases . Identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc cellular receptors is crucial for elucidating the mechanism of early virus - host interactions and the pathogenesis of enteroviruses 1 . Here we identify human P - selectin glycoprotein ligand - 1 ( PSGL - 1 ; CD162 ) , a sialomucin membrane protein expressed on leukocytes that has a major role in early stages of inﬂammation 2 – 4 , as a functional receptor for EV71 using an expression cloning method by panning 5 . The N - terminal region of PSGL - 1 binds speciﬁcally to EV71 . Stable PSGL - 1 expression allowed EV71 entry and replication , and development of cytopathic effects in nonsusceptible mouse L929 cells . Five out of eight EV71 strains bound soluble PSGL - 1 and used intact PSGL - 1 as the primary receptor for infection of Jurkat T cells . Three other EV71 strains did not use PSGL - 1 , suggesting the presence of strain - speciﬁc replication of EV71 in leukocytes . EV71 replicated in nonleukocyte cell lines in a PSGL - 1 – independent manner , indicating the presence of alternative receptor ( s ) for EV71 . The identiﬁcation of PSGL - 1 as a receptor for EV71 sheds new light on a role for PSGL - 1 – positive leukocytes in cell tropism and pathogenesis during the course of HFMD and other EV71 - mediated diseases . EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 ( CVA16 ) belong to the human entero - virus species A of the genus Enterovirus 6 and are the major causative agents of HFMD . EV71 may cause various neurological diseases , such as aseptic meningitis , acute ﬂaccid paralysis and fatal neurogenic pulmonary edema . Severe EV71 outbreaks have been reported periodically throughout the world , representing a major public health concern , particularly in the Asia - Paciﬁc region 7 – 9 . During large outbreaks of EV71 , individuals with severe EV71 - associated encepha - litis and neurogenic pulmonary edema showed a marked depletion of T cells and high levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines 10 , 11 . Because of this T cell involvement , we generated a retroviral complementary DNA ( cDNA ) library from Jurkat T cells that are susceptible to EV71 infection 12 and used it for expression cloning 5 to identify a receptor that speciﬁcally binds EV71 virions ( EV71 - 1095 strain , Supplemen - tary Table 1 ) . Transduction of mouse myeloma P3X63Ag8U . 1 ( P3U1 ) cells with the Jurkat cDNA library resulted in the formation of four colonies that bound EV71 - 1095 – coated dishes , all of which encoded human PSGL - 1 ( SELPLG ) ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . To conﬁrm the speciﬁc binding of PSGL - 1 to EV71 - 1095 , we used 293T cells , which express undetectable amounts of endogenous PSGL - 1 . Transient expression of human PSGL - 1 on 293T cells markedly increased the binding of EV71 - 1095 to 293T cells ( Fig . 1b ) ; however , expression of control ligands ( sialomucin proteins CD34 and CD43 ) and mouse Psgl - 1 did not ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To identify the region of human PSGL - 1 that is important for EV71 binding , we ﬁrst constructed a chimeric PSGL - 1 ( hmPSGL - 1 ) containing amino acids 1 – 61 of the human PSGL - 1 followed by amino acids 63 – 397 of mouse Psgl - 1 ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) . EV71 - 1095 bound hmPSGL - 1 expressed on 293T cells ( Supplementary Fig . 3c ) . To conﬁrm this ﬁnding , we examined whether monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) recog - nizing PSGL - 1 ( KPL1 ( refs . 13 , 14 ) and PL2 ( ref . 15 ) ; Fig . 1a ) block the PSGL - 1 – EV71 interaction . KPL1 , which blocks P - selectin binding to PSGL - 1 ( ref . 13 ) , inhibited EV71 - 1095 binding to 293T cells transi - ently expressing PSGL - 1 in a dose - dependent manner ; however , PL2 , which does not block binding to P - selectin , did not ( Fig . 1c ) . These ﬁndings suggest that the N - terminal region ( amino acids 42 – 61 ) of human PSGL - 1 is crucial for interactions with EV71 - 1095 . To test whether PSGL - 1 is involved in the later steps of viral entry after binding to cells , we used mouse cells that do not support EV71 infection . Mouse myeloma P3U1 cells expressing human PSGL - 1 did not support efﬁcient EV71 replication ( data not shown ) . Therefore , we obtained an L929 cell clone ( L - PSGL - 1 . 1 ) that stably expresses high amounts of human PSGL - 1 ( Fig . 2a ) . L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells showed a cytopathic effect 4 d after infection , and we detected EV71 antigen by immunoﬂuorescence in the infected L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells ( Fig . 2b ) . The development of cytopathic effect and detection of viral antigens induced by EV71 - 1095 infection was markedly inhibited by KPL1 ( Fig . 2b ) , but not by PL2 ( data not shown ) , as were the replication kinetics of EV71 - 1095 in infected L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells ( Fig . 2c , d ) , Received 2 December 2008 ; accepted 6 April 2009 ; published online 21 June 2009 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nm . 1961 1 Department of Virology II , National Institute of Infectious Diseases , Musashimurayama - shi , Tokyo , Japan . 2 Division of Virology , Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Institute of Medical Science , University of Tokyo , Minato - ku , Tokyo , Japan . 3 Present address : Japan Poliomyelitis Research Institute , Higashimurayama - shi , Tokyo , Japan .

Further - more , pretreatment of EV71 - 1095 with a soluble form of recombinant PSGL - 1 ( PSGL - 1 – Fc ) impaired viral replication 2 – 4 d after viral inoculation of L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells ( Fig . 2e ) and RD cells ( Supplemen - tary Table 2 ) expressing undetectable PSGL - 1 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of PSGL - 1 – Fc is due to either direct binding to EV71 virions or virion uncoating induced by the PSGL - 1 – Fc – EV71 interaction . To elucidate the biological role of PSGL - 1 – dependent cell tropism of EV71 - 1095 , we investigated the relationship between PSGL - 1 expres - sion on the cell surface ( Fig . 3a ) and replication of EV71 ( Fig . 3b ) in various cell lines ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Among the four leukocyte cell lines examined , we found PSGL - 1 – dependent viral replication , as indicated by the reduction of viral titers in the presence of KPL1 in Jurkat T cells and U937 monocytic cells , which express large amounts of PSGL - 1 on the cell surface . EV71 - 1095 induced a faint cytopathic effect in Jurkat T cells but no apparent cytopathic effect in the other leukocyte cell lines ( data not shown ) . EV71 - 1095 replication was not affected by KPL1 in MT - 2 cells and four nonleukocyte cell lines ( RD , HEp - 2c , SK - N - MC and Vero ) that have little or no PSGL - 1 expression , suggesting PSGL - 1 – independent replication through unidentiﬁed receptors in MT - 2 and nonleukocyte cells . Taken together , these results suggest that EV71 - 1095 can use PSGL - 1 as a functional cellular receptor in PSGL - 1 – positive leukocytes ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , but it may use alternative mechanism ( s ) for replication in cells that have little or no PSGL - 1 expression ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Although the association of a speciﬁc genogroup with severe neurological diseases has not been identiﬁed through molecular epidemiological analyses of previous and recent EV71 isolates ( geno - groups A , B and C ) 9 , 16 , in vitro and in vivo phenotypes may be associated with certain amino acid determinants of EV71 . Using eight representative EV71 strains ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , we investigated the strain speciﬁcity of EV71 and PSGL - 1 use . We ﬁrst examined the direct biochemical interaction between EV71 strains and PSGL - 1 – Fc by co - immunoprecipitation . The VP1 proteins of the SK - EV006 , C7 / Osaka , KED005 , 1095 and 75 - Yamagata strains of EV71 immuno - precipitated with PSGL - 1 – Fc ( Fig . 4a ) . In contrast , the VP1 proteins of the BrCr , Nagoya and 02363 strains of EV71 did not immuno - precipitate with PSGL - 1 – Fc ( Fig . 4a ) . Thus , these EV71 strains can be classiﬁed into two distinct phenotypes according to their PSGL - 1 – binding capability , regardless of genogroup : ﬁve PSGL - 1 – binding strains ( EV71 - PB ; SK - EV006 ( genogroup B3 ) , C7 / Osaka ( B4 ) , KED005 ( C1 ) , 1095 ( C2 ) and 75 - Yamagata ( C4 ) ) and three PSGL - 1 – nonbinding strains ( EV71 – non - PB ; BrCr ( A ) , Nagoya ( B1 ) and 02363 ( C1 ) ) .

All ﬁve EV71 - PB strains replicated in Jurkat T cells in a PSGL - 1 – dependent manner , as indicated by the reduction of viral titers in the presence of KPL1 at 4 d after inoculation ( Fig . 4b ) . Among the three EV71 – non - PB strains , two ( Nagoya and 02363 ) replicated in Jurkat T cells in a PSGL - 1 – independent manner , and the BrCr strain replicated poorly ( Fig . 4b ) . These data indicate that EV71 - PB strains use PSGL - 1 as the primary and functional receptor for infection of Jurkat T cells ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) , whereas some of the EV71 – non - PB strains may use unidentiﬁed receptors for viral replication even in PSGL - 1 – positive T lymphocytes ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Although the KED005 and 02363 strains ( genogroup C1 ) show distinct differences in their PSGL - 1 – binding phenotypes , only four amino acids ( Ile55 of VP3 and Lys98 , Glu145 and Ile262 of VP1 for the EV71 - 02363 strain ) are different in the proteins comprising the entire capsid region of these two strains , suggesting that a few amino acid determinants in the capsid proteins are fully responsible for the phenotype ( Fig . 4 ) . Among the four amino acid differences , Glu145 of VP1 may be exposed on a surface - exposed loop in the capsid VP1 protein , and this has been identiﬁed as a major virulence determinant in mouse models 17 , 18 . We next investigated PSGL - 1 – dependent replication of the proto - type CVA16 - G10 strain . This strain replicated in L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells but not in L - bsd cells ( a PSGL - 1 – negative control ) , and virus replication in L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells was inhibited by KPL1 ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . The CVA16 - G10 strain used PSGL - 1 to infect L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells but not Jurkat T cells ( Supplementary Fig . 4c ) , suggesting that CVA16 - G10 represents a strain that uses an alternative entry mechanism via unidentiﬁed functional receptors for infection of Jurkat T cells . PSGL - 1 expressed on leukocytes has a crucial role in the tethering and rolling of leukocytes during recruitment of cells from blood vessels to the sites of acute inﬂammation upon stimulation by infection 2 – 4 . The tissue expression of PSGL - 1 is primarily restricted to hematopoie - tic myeloid , lymphoid and dendritic lineages and to platelets . However , PSGL - 1 is also expressed on the dendritic cells of lymph nodes and on macrophages in the intestinal mucosa 2 , which could be the primary site of EV71 replication after viral ingestion . During the viremic phase of infection , a variety of circulating leukocytes expressing PSGL - 1 may be responsible for the in vivo replication of EV71 ( ref . 19 ) and subsequent EV71 - induced apoptosis in the infected cells 12 , 20 , possibly resulting in the T cell depletion and changes in cytokine levels observed in severe Jurkat 1 h 0 * * * * * * * * * * * V i r a l t i t e r ( l og 10 CC I D 50 pe r 100 µ l ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 d 4 d 6 d 1 h 2 d 4 d 6 d 1 h 2 d 4 d 6 d 1 h 2 d 4 d 6 d 1 h 2 d 4 d 6 d 1 h 2 d 4 d 6 d 1 h 2 d 4 d 6 d 1 h 2 d 4 d 6 d PSGL - 1 a b U937 MOLT - 4 MT - 2 RD HEp - 2c SK - N - MC Vero NoneIgG1KPL1 Figure 3 PSGL - 1 expression and EV71 - 1095 replication kinetics in leukocyte and nonleukocyte cell lines .

In addition , the dis - tribution and recruitment of PSGL - 1 – positive Langerhans cells and lymphocytes in inﬂamed skin 2 are consistent with the apparent HFMD pathogenesis associated with EV71 and CVA16 infection , which is characterized by acute skin inﬂammation . In this regard , our ﬁndings suggest the involvement of PSGL - 1 – positive inﬂammatory cells during the course of EV71 and CVA16 infection . Although EV71 infects neurons and causes acute brainstem encephalitis , paralysis or both in humans 21 , 22 and experimental animals 17 , 23 – 25 , PSGL - 1 is apparently not expressed in the adult human brain 2 . Consistent with this observation , we have shown that EV71 - 1095 may also use PSGL - 1 – independent mechanism ( s ) for replication in nonleukocyte cells , including SK - N - MC neuroblastoma cells . Furthermore , CVA16 , another causative agent of HFMD , can also use PSGL - 1 as a functional receptor in L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells . Thus , PSGL - 1 – dependent viral replication is unlikely to be directly respon - sible for the neuronal cell apoptosis induced by EV71 ( refs . 26 , 27 ) . However , we cannot exclude the possible involvement of PSGL - 1 – positive inﬂammatory cells in the pathogenesis of HFMD and a variety of EV71 diseases with or without neurological manifestations . We have shown that human PSGL - 1 is a functional cellular receptor for EV71 infection . The occurrence of severe EV71 infection with a number of fatal encephalitis cases continues to be a major public health threat even now 28 , but , currently , no vaccines or speciﬁc antiviral agents are available for EV71 . Because soluble PSGL - 1 inhibits EV71 replica - tion , it may be a potential inhibitor of EV71 - PB infection . The identiﬁcation of PSGL - 1 as a functional EV71 receptor on leuko - cytes is the ﬁrst major step in elucidating EV71 pathogenesis at the molecular level . However , other EV71 and human enterovirus species A receptors on leukocyte and nonleukocyte cells may also have key implications in EV71 tropism and pathogenesis , particularly for severe central nervous system diseases . Further structural and functional analyses of interactions of EV71 with PSGL - 1 and other unidentiﬁed receptors may provide new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of severe EV71 diseases .

We maintained RD , HEp - 2c , SK - N - MC and Vero cells in Eagle’s minimal essential medium ( Nissui ) supplemented with 10 % FCS . Viruses . We propagated all EV71 strains ( Supplementary Table 1 ) in RD or Vero cells . Because some of the strains produced diffuse plaques on RD cells , we determined the viral titers by a microtitration assay using 96 - well plates and RD cells as previously described 23 . Brieﬂy , we used ten wells for each viral dilution and expressed the viral titers as 50 % cell culture infectious dose ( CCID 50 ) . Monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins . We generated the EV71 - speciﬁc mAbs MA105 ( mouse IgG2b ) and MA35 ( mouse IgG2a ) from mice immunized with EV71 - 1095 ( Y . Tano et al . , unpublished data ) . We purchased the EV71 - speciﬁc mAb 10F0 from Biogenesis . We purchased the mAbs to human CD34 ( clone 563 ) , human CD43 ( L60 ) , human PSGL - 1 ( KPL1 ) , and mouse Psgl - 1 ( 4RA10 ) from BD Biosciences , and we purchased human PSGL - 1 – speciﬁc mAb PL2 from Beckman - Coulter . For negative controls , we purchased human ( MOPC - 21 ) and rat IgG1 ( R3 - 34 ) and human IgG2b ( 27 - 35 ) from BD Biosciences . We used NaN 3 - free mAbs , MOPC - 21 ( BioLegend ) and NCG01 ( Lab Vision ) in cell culture as negative controls . We purchased soluble recombinant forms of human proteins fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 ( PSGL - 1 – Fc and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen - 4 – Fc ) from R & D Systems . Preparation of EV71 - 1095 – coated dishes and selection of Jurkat T cell clones . We incubated a polystyrene Petri dish ( Ina - optika ) with 10 m g ml – 1 MA35 in 10 ml of 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 9 . 4 ) at 4 1 C overnight . We rinsed the dishes twice with PBS containing 2 % FCS ( PBS - 2FCS ) and blocked them with PBS - 2FCS at 25 1 C for 30 min . We then applied EV71 - 1095 ( 10 ml , 1 (cid:1) 10 8 . 6 CCID 50 ml – 1 ) to the MA35 - coated dishes and incubated at 25 1 C for 30 min . We replaced the supernatant with a fresh viral preparation , and we repeated replacing the supernatant three times . We ﬁxed the dishes with a viral preparation containing 1 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 25 1 C . Finally , we washed the dishes with PBS - 2FCS ﬁve times and used them for selection and expression cloning . We selected Jurkat T cell clones that expressed high levels of EV71 - binding molecules on the cell surface with the panning method with EV71 - 1095 – coated dishes . We added Jurkat T cells to the EV71 - coated dishes in RPMI - 1640 medium and incubated them at 4 1 C for 90 min . We removed nonadherent cells by washing with RPMI - 1640 medium , and we cultured the adherent cells for a week . We used the Jurkat T cell colonies on the EV71 - coated dishes for preparation of the cDNA library . Retroviral cDNA library . Using the Jurkat T cell colonies on the EV71 - coated dishes , we prepared a retroviral cDNA library as previously described 29 with minor modiﬁcations . We used the Pantropic Retroviral Expression System ( Clontech ) to prepare vesicular stomatitis virus G protein – pseudotyped retro - viruses . We ligated the Jurkat cDNA with the EcoRI adaptor and cloned it into the EcoRI site of the pLIB retroviral vector ( Clontech ) . We transfected the pLIB plasmid along with a vesicular stomatitis virus G protein expression plasmid into GP2 - 293 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . We harvested the culture supernatant 2 d after transfection and used it to infect P3U1 cells . Expression cloning of the EV71 - binding receptor . We preformed retrovirus - mediated expression cloning using EV71 - coated dishes and P3U1 cells as described previously 5 . We isolated genomic DNA from each P3U1 cell colony bound to the EV71 - coated dishes , subjected it to PCR ampliﬁcation with pLIB - speciﬁc primers and sequenced the ampliﬁcation product . Expression plasmids . We cloned the cDNAs encoding human SELPLG , CD34 , SPN and mouse Selplg into pEF6 - Flag - 3S to produce pEF - PSGL - 1 , pEF - CD34 , pEF - CD43 and pEF - mPsgl - 1 , respectively . For hmPSGL - 1 expression , we constructed chimeric SELPLG cDNA by PCR and cloned it into pEF6 - Flag - 3S . The primers used for cDNA cloning and chimeric protein construction and mutation are shown in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 . More details are provided in the Supplementary Methods . Detection of cell surface molecules by ﬂow cytometry . We washed cells once with ﬂow cytometry buffer ( PBS supplemented with 2 mM EDTA , 2 % FCS and 0 . 1 % NaN 3 ) and incubated them with mAb on ice for 30 min . After washing with ﬂow cytometry buffer , we incubated the cells with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 ( Invitrogen ) . We washed and analyzed the cells by FACSCalibur ( BD Biosciences ) . EV71 - binding assay by ﬂow cytometry . We collected 293T cells 24 h after transfection with expression plasmids , washed them once with ﬂow cytometry buffer and incubated them with the EV71 - 1095 preparation ( 1 (cid:1) 10 7 CCID 50 ) supplemented with 0 . 1 % NaN 3 or concentrated viruses ( containing 0 . 5 m g of VP1 protein ) per 50 m l ﬂow cytometry buffer . In the binding inhibi - tion assay with mAbs , we treated cells with mAb for 30 min on ice before exposing them to the virus . We washed the cells and stained them with Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated MA105 , washed them and then analyzed them by FACSCalibur . Establishment of the L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cell line . To establish a mouse L929 cell line expressing human PSGL - 1 , we transfected L929 cells with pEF - PSGL - 1 and selected stable transfectants with 5 m g ml – 1 blasticidin S HCl ( Invitrogen ) . Through a limiting dilution of the various cell colonies , we selected three of the 16 cell lines on the basis of high PSGL - 1 expression . Finally , we established L - PSGL - 1 . 1 as the single cell clone that supported the most efﬁcient EV71 - 1095 replication . As a PSGL - 1 – negative control , we also established an L - bsd cell line by transfecting L929 cells with pEF6 - Flag - 3S followed by selection with 5 m g ml – 1 blasticidin . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . We ﬁxed cells with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 25 1 C , washed them , permeabilized them with PBS containing 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min at 25 1 C , blocked them with PBS containing 1 % BSA for 10 min at 25 1 C and incubated them with VP1 - speciﬁc mAb 10F0 labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 for 30 min at 37 1 C . After a ﬁnal wash , we analyzed the cells with a ﬂuorescence microscope ( Keyence ) . Immunoprecipitation and western blotting . We diluted concentrated viruses ( 0 . 5 m g VP1 protein ) in 300 m l of immunoprecipitation buffer ( 20 mM Tris - Cl , 135 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 and 10 % glycerol ; pH 7 . 4 ) and incubated them with 1 m g of mAb or chimeric proteins for 2 h at 4 1 C . We added Dynabeads Protein G ( Invitrogen ) and incubated the mixture for an additional 2 h . We washed the beads and subjected the immunoprecipitates to 12 . 5 % SDS - PAGE . For western blotting , we transferred the proteins onto nitro - cellulose membranes and blotted with MA105 . Viral infection assays . We inoculated cells ( 4 (cid:1) 10 4 cells per 200 m l in a 48 - well plate ) with viruses at 10 CCID 50 per cell for 1 h , washed them and incubated them in medium at 34 1 C ( for L - PSGL - 1 . 1 , Jurkat , U937 , MOLT - 4 or MT - 2 cells ) or 37 1 C ( for RD , HEp - 2c , SK - N - MC or Vero cells ) . For mAb inhibition , we pretreated the cells with 10 m g ml – 1 mAb for 1 h , washed them and maintained them in the medium with 10 m g ml – 1 mAb . For inhibition with PSGL - 1 – Fc , we pretreated EV71 - 1095 ( 1 (cid:1) 10 5 CCID 50 ) with 1 m g PSGL - 1 – Fc per 100 m l for 1 h and then inoculated them into L - PSGL - 1 . 1 cells . We incubated the cells for 1 h in the presence of PSGL - 1 – Fc , washed them and maintained them in the absence of PSGL - 1 – Fc . We subjected the culture supernatants and infected cells to three cycles of freeze - thawing before titration . Statistical analyses . We carried out all infection assays in triplicate and compared the mean viral titers with Student’s t test ( two - tailed ) . We considered P values of o 0 . 01 statistically signiﬁcant . 29 .
