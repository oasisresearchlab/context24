Milner , * Jai Up Kim , * Allan Bradley , † and Yassemi Capetanaki * , 2 * Department of Cell Biology and † Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Institute for Molecular Genetics , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas 77030 A differentiating system based on embryonic stem ( ES ) cell - derived embryoid bodies ( EBs ) which recapitulates the in vivo cardiac , skeletal , and smooth muscle myogenesis of mouse embryos was developed and used to investigate the effects of the disruption of the desmin gene on muscle cell differentiation . Wild - type , heterozygous , and homozygous cell lines with the mutated desmin allele were evaluated . Skeletal myogenesis was totally inhibited in desmin null mutant EBs , as manifested by the absence of myotube formation , contractility , and myoD , myogenin , myf5 , and myosin heavy chain expression . Smooth muscle formation was also completely blocked in the absence of desmin . On the other hand , there were no obvious effects on cardiomyocyte differentiation in these desmin null mutant EBs . However , reduced desmin expression in EBs heterozygous for the desmin mutation leads to partial inhibition of cardiac muscle formation . These data suggest that in contrast to early cardiocyte differentiation , desmin is indispensable for skeletal and smooth muscle formation . (cid:113) 1995 Academic Press , Inc .

In plates with lower numbers of EBs ( less than 50 EBs per 10 - cm dish ) the EBs were viable for up to 40 days ; however , myogenesis in these EBs was signiﬁcantly reduced or delayed ( data not shown ) .

Low levels of des - min mRNA were detected on Day 5 , reached a maximum level at Day 9 , and remained constant thereafter at least until Day 19 . Similarly , desmin protein could be detected on Days 6 to 7 in low abundance and reached full levels at Day 9 .

As an additional positive control , EBs , generated from several of the nontargeted cell clones which had undergone the selection procedures , were checked for their potential to differentiate . The initiation of cardiomyocyte differentiation , as as - sayed by temporal appearance of rythmically beating car - diac muscle forming units , seemed to be indistinguishable in all cell lines regardless of genotype .

There was , however , a minor population of cells with Myf5 signals slightly above large polynucleated myotubes ( Fig . 5E , striated bars ) , whereas the number of small oligonucleated myotubes was background ( Fig . 7C ) and only few individual cells with normal myf5 levels ( Fig . 7D ) .

Very few large , The recent in vitro studies using desmin antisense RNA demonstrated that at least in the C2C12 cell system desmin polynucleated myotubes were formed in des m1 / / EBs ( Fig . 5B ) . In des m1 / des m1 EBs a large number of spindle - shaped is very important for skeletal myogenesis ( Li et al . , 1994 ) . The very early onset of desmin expression during mouse cells were found in areas where myotubes are formed in wild - type EBs ( Fig . 6C ) . These spindle cells ( Colley et al . , embryogenesis and the fact that desmin is the only muscle - speciﬁc protein which is expressed in all three muscle tis - 1990 ) are also seen in wild - type EBs surrounding areas of myotubes . These cells stain with desmin , MyoD , and myo - sues led us to the hypothesis that desmin might indeed play one or more vital roles during early steps of myogenic cell genin antibodies ( Figs . 6E – 6G ) and they do not yet express myosin heavy chain ( data not shown ) , suggesting that they commitment and differentiation as well as terminal differ - entiation .

Interestingly , EBs with complete absence of des m1 EBs . Very little is known so far about smooth muscle differentiation and development . At the present , there is desmin were phenotypically wild type . From these data we can draw two conclusions . First , desmin does not seem to be only one known gene product , the myocyte enhancer bind - ing factor - 2 , MEF2 ( Gossett et al . , 1989 ) , which in Drosoph - vital for cardiocyte commitment and early differentiation , including the formation of a contractile apparatus , at least ila seems to be very important for smooth muscle differenti - ation ( Lilly et al . , 1995 ) . It is of interest to note that the in this in vitro system . It is possible that vimentin , the growth - regulated intermediate ﬁlament protein present in desmin gene is one of the earliest genes to be activated by MEF2 , at least in mammalian skeletal ( Li et al . , 1993 ; Li these cells , can compensate for possible desmin function , at least for the ﬁrst 20 days of EB cell differentiation . Second , and Capetanaki , 1994 ) and cardiac muscle ( Kuisk et al . , 1995 ) . A severe phenotype was also observed in des m1 / / EBs . reduced expression of desmin severely interferes with the maintenance and performance of newly formed cardiocytes . Expression of reduced levels of desmin was correlated with a considerable reduction in secondary myotube formation . It has been reported that abnormal accumulation of desmin correlates with some familial cardio - and skeletal myopa - The myocyte population increased , which can be consid - ered to reﬂect the reduced fusion potential of des m1 / / myo - thies ( for review see Goeble and Bornemann , 1993 ) . One might speculate that any alteration in desmin expression blasts . These effects on skeletal myogenesis in des m1 / / EBs are consistent with in vitro studies using antisense desmin leads to altered regulation of other vital proteins in cardio - cytes or directly causes an instability of the contractile ap - RNA where partial inhibition of desmin expression disturbs normal myogenesis in C2C12 cells ( Li et al . , 1994 ) . In des - paratus which leads to the phenotype of lower beating fre - quency , arrhythmia , and occasional tachycardia . For rea - min null mutant EBs the fusion of presumptive myoblasts and the formation of polynucleated myotubes were com - sons unknown at the present , these cells can compensate complete absence of desmin but not reduced expression . It pletely blocked similar to the block of differentiation in C2C12 cell cultures where antisense desmin RNA was used could be speculated that during cell commitment to the cardiac phenotype , the cell adapts in a way that allows the ( Li et al . , 1994 ) . Spindle - shaped cells accumulated in des m1 / des m1 EBs with a temporal pattern which was similar to use of a similar protein , vimentin , to serve its purposes . When desmin is expressed at half normal levels , these adap - myotube formation in wild - type EBs . Since these cells are negative for MyoD , myogenin , and myf5 it is impossible to tions probably are not deleterious at the beginning , but later are detremental and the cells perform very poorly . It should assess their identity . We cannot really say if these cells are determined myoblasts or not . Consequently , we can only be noted here that recent reports with vimentin null mice suggested that the absence of vimentin was most possibly speculate that the loss of desmin either blocks directly some speciﬁc step during early myogenic commitment and differ - compensated by other IFs that are normally coexpressed with this IF protein ( Colucci - Guyon et al . , 1994 ) . The same entiation or alternatively it interferes with the maintenance of the myogenic phenotype . How could desmin be involved compensatory mechanism might explain the absence of any obvious abnormal phenotype in the recently reported glial in these processes ? Myogenesis can be divided into several phases , including cell commitment , exit from the cell cycle , ﬁbrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) null mice ( Gomi et al . , 1995 ) . On the other hand there are many functions in the initiation of differentiation , cell recognition and alignment , cell adhesion , and cell fusion ( for review see Wakelam , cell that might not have been compensated and have not been investigated in the above cases . It was recently shown 1985 ) . During most of these processes extensive signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus takes that biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids is reduced in the absence of vimentin ( Gillard et al . , 1994 ) . Similarly , it has place . Desmin could actively participate in one or more FIG . 6 . The desmin gene knockout blocks myotube formation . ( A ) Polynucleated myotubes in wild - type EBs .

If desmin , indeed , somehow modulates signals that lead to a postmitotic state , this could explain the absence of an obvious effect during cardiac cell differen - tiation , since these cells , in contrast to skeletal myoblasts , can both proliferate and differentiate simultaneously ( for review see Olson , 1993 and Lassar and Munsterberg , 1994 ) . If desmin is involved in cell recognition or attachment pro - cesses rather than fusion itself , this might explain why smooth muscle development is also severely inhibited in desmin null mutant EBs , since these cells do not fuse . Des - min , through its interaction with the membrane skeleton ( for review see Lazarides and Capetanaki , 1986 ; Nelson and Lazarides , 1984 ; Georgatos et al . , 1987 ) and particularly with components of the costameres ( Tokuyasu et al . , 1983a , b ; for review see Price , 1992 ) , might be involved in integrating and stabilizing several of their potential func - tions , including cell recognition , adhesion , and signal trans - duction . Adhesion molecules and receptors have already been reported to play important role ( s ) in myogenesis ( Menko and Boettinger , 1987 ; Rosen et al . , 1992 ; Holt et al . , 1994 ) . Finally , desmin could be directly involved in myoblast fusion . This possibility could be favored by several reported observations . Ectopic expression of desmin in the lenses of transgenic mice causes , among other abnormali - ties , partial plasma membrane fusion ( Krimpenfort et al . , 1988 ; Dunia et al . , 1990 ) . Furthermore , our previous anti - sense studies ( Li et al . , 1994 ) as well as those from other investigators ( Choi et al . , 1990 ; Lin et al . , 1994 ) have sug - gested that fusion can take place only between desmin - positive cells . Finally , the correct quantity of desmin seems to be necessary for maintaining the phenotype in newly formed myotubes , because reduced levels of desmin protein in des m1 / / EBs caused a collapse of most myotubes . Potential Mechanisms of Control of the Myogenic HLH Regulators by the IF Cytoskeleton The present data clearly demonstrated that in the absence of desmin the expression of the mHLH regulators is su - pressed . Therefore , it could be speculated that desmin regu - lates myogenesis by inﬂuencing nuclear events , possibly through its potential involvement in myogenic signal trans - duction and transport processes between the cell surface and the nucleus . This could be a way by which this part of the cytoskeleton can participate in the establishment and maintenance of the myogenic phenotype , in the initiation of differentiation , fusion , and maintenance of the terminally differentiated state . As pointed out above , desmin could be responsible for one or more of these processes . However , the observation that the absence of desmin causes also su - FIG . 7 .
