Methods : One hundred twenty - eight patients with gastric cancer were included in this study . Formalin - ﬁxed parafﬁn - embedded specimens were stained for VEGF and cortactin , and the correlation between the staining , clinicopathological parameters and prognostic power were analyzed . Results : Of the 128 patients studied , 58 ( 45 . 3 % ) and 71 ( 55 . 5 % ) cases were strongly positive for VEGF and cortactin , respectively . VEGF expression correlated with Lauren classiﬁcation ( P < 0 . 001 ) , pathological tumor stage ( P < 0 . 001 ) , and pathological tumor node metastasis ( TNM ) stage ( P ¼ 0 . 003 ) . Cortactin expression correlated with pathological lymph node stage ( P ¼ 0 . 018 ) , pathological TNM stage ( P < 0 . 001 ) , and degree of differentiation ( P < 0 . 001 ) . There were statistically signiﬁcant associations between tumor recurrence and VEGF expression ( P ¼ 0 . 023 ) , and cortactin expression ( P < 0 . 001 ) . In multivariate analysis , pathological TNM stage , VEGF expression , and cortactin expression were independent prognostic inﬂuence on disease - free survival ( P < 0 . 001 , 0 . 022 , and 0 . 034 , respectively ) . Conclusions : VEGF and cortactin may be a good biomarker to be applied in clinic to predict the prognosis of patients with curatively resected gastric cancer . J . Surg .

K EY W ORDS : gastric cancer ; tumor recurrence ; prognostic factor ; vascular endothelial growth factor ; cortactin INTRODUCTION Although the incidence of gastric carcinoma has fallen in most Western countries , it remains a signiﬁcant problem in terms of global health and is the second most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide [ 1 ] . Despite the fact that the majority of the patients at an early stage of gastric carcinoma can be cured by surgery , more than one half of the patients at an advanced stage of the disease die of carcinoma recurrence , even when they had undergone curative gastrectomy [ 2 ] . Recurrence probably arises from growth of occult micrometastases that have already become established by the time of surgery in patients who underwent curative operation . This may be dependent on the biological nature of the resected tumor itself [ 3 ] . Currently , the use of clinical parameters only cannot accurately predict the clinical outcome of patients after surgery [ 4 ] . It has been reported that vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , which was thought to be a potent angiogenesis - promoting factor , correlates with tumor progression and prognosis via angiogenesis [ 5 , 6 ] . Tumor VEGF expression was shown to be a signiﬁcant marker for tumor recurrence or reduced survival independent of conventional clinicopathological variables in several cancers [ 7 ] . In cases of gastric cancer , a positive correlation between VEGF expression and lymphatic invasion , LN metastasis , venous invasion , and patient outcome has been reported by several groups [ 5 , 8 , 9 ] , but there are also published reports that contradict this notion [ 10 , 11 ] . Cortactin is an actin - binding protein that activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to regulate the actin cytoskeleton [ 12 ] and inhibit debranching of dendritic actin networks [ 13 ] . The gene responsible for cortactin expression is in the chromosome 11q13 region and is frequently ampliﬁed in some human cancers , such as breast and head / neck carcinomas [ 14 , 15 ] . Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton has effects on cell migration , motility , and adhesion , as well as on tumor invasion and metastasis [ 12 ] . In some studies , overexpression of cortactin correlated with depth of invasion in colorectal cancer [ 16 ] , as well as poor prognosis for patients with lymph node metastasis [ 14 , 15 , 17 ] . However , the prognostic signiﬁcance of cortactin status in patients with gastric remains vague [ 18 ] . Thus , the present study was designed to investigate the clinico - pathological role of expression of VEGF and cortactin , as well as whether VEGF and cortactin expression are independent predictors of tumor recurrence following curative resection of gastric cancer . MATERIALS AND METHODS A consecutive series of 152 patients with primary gastric cancer received surgical treatment at our hospital between January 2004 and January 2006 . Of them , 128 ( 84 . 2 % ) patients underwent potentially curative resection [ R0 resection following the International Union * Correspondence to : Jiejun Wang , MD , Department of Medical Oncology , Shanghai Changzheng Hospital , afﬁliated to The Second Military Medical University .

Against Cancer ( UICC ) criteria ] [ 19 ] , deﬁned as macroscopically and microscopically complete removal of the tumor on intraoperative and histopathologic evaluation . The characteristics of patients included in the study are shown in Table I . Staging and grading were referred to the ﬁfth edition of the tumor node metastasis ( TNM ) classiﬁcation of UICC [ 19 ] . Accordingly , 17 patients ( 13 . 3 % ) were classiﬁed as stage I , 22 ( 17 . 2 % ) as stage II , 59 ( 46 . 1 % ) as stage III , and 30 ( 23 . 4 % ) as stage IV . The pathological diagnosis of these cases was reviewed by two experienced pathologists ( M . M . and W . W . ) . The histopathological differentiation of gastric adenocarcinoma was determined according to World Health Organization criteria for tumor classiﬁcation [ 20 ] . Ninety - ﬁve patients ( 74 . 2 % ) underwent adjuvant chemotherapy . The regimens included FOLFOX6 ( Oxaliplatin þ Fluorouracil / Leucovorin , 60 cases , with a median cycle of 6 ) , Docetaxel þ 5FU / CF ( Docetaxel þ Fluorouracil / Leucovorin , 16 cases , with a median cycle of 4 ) , CAPOX ( Capecitabine þ Oxaliplatin , 14 cases , with a median cycle of 5 ) , and Docetaxel þ cisplatin ( 5 cases , with a median cycle of 4 ) . No cases had received radiation or chemotherapy before surgery . After a mean follow - up of 49 . 5 months ( range , 40 . 5 – 63 . 5 months ) , 46 ( 35 . 9 % ) patients developed tumor recurrence , 29 of whom presented as locoregional relapse , 10 as distant metastases ( 6 in liver , 2 in lung , and 2 in bone ) , and 7 as peritoneal seeding . All but two patients with tumor recurrence died from it . The study was conducted with the approval of the institutional ethics board of our institute . Immunohistochemistry Parafﬁn - embedded tumor tissues were obtained and tissue micro - array slides were constructed . Tissue microarray sections were de - waxed in xylene , rehydrated in alcohol , and immersed in 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 5min to suppress endogenous peroxidase activity . Antigen retrieval was performed by heating ( 100 8 C ) each section for 30min in 0 . 01mol / L sodium citrate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 ) . After three rinses ( each for 5min in phosphate - buffered saline [ PBS ] ) , sections were incubated for 1hr at room temperature with antibody . The following antibodies were used in this study : a polyclonal antibody against VEGF ( clone A - 20 at a 1 : 300 dilution , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , and a polyclonal rabbit anti - human cortactin ( clone H - 191 ) antibody ( 1 : 100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) diluted in PBS . After three washes ( each for 5min in PBS ) , sections were incubated with biotin - labeled secondary immunoglobulin ( 1 : 100 , DAKO , Glostrup , Denmark ) for 1hr at room temperature . After three additional washes , peroxidase activity was developed with diaminobenzidine ( DAB ; DAKO ) at room temperature . The immunostaining intensity was separately evaluated by two pathologists ( M . M . and W . W . ) who had no knowledge of the patients’ clinical status . For cortactin expression , samples were classiﬁed into two groups , positive group or negative / weak group . At least 200 tumor cells were scored per 40 (cid:3) ﬁeld . All sections were scored in a semiquantitative manner according to the method described previously , which reﬂects both the intensity and percentage of cells staining at each intensity [ 16 ] . Intensity was classiﬁed as 0 ( no staining ) , þ 1 ( weak staining ) , þ 2 ( distinct staining ) , or þ 3 ( very strong staining ) . A value designated the ‘‘HSCORE’’ was obtained for each slide by using the following algorithm : HSCORE ¼ S ( I (cid:3) PC ) , where I and PC represent staining intensity and the percentage of cells that stain at each intensity , respectively , and the corresponding HSCOREs were calculated separately . Expression of VEGF or cortactin was classiﬁed as follows : when (cid:4) 30 % of the carcinoma cells in a given specimen were positively stained for VEGF or cortactin , the sample was classiﬁed as VEGF - or cortactin - positive . Statistical Analysis Correlations between clinicopathological factors and cortactin expression were analyzed using Fisher’s exact probability test or w 2 test . Univariate analysis was performed by modeling Kaplan – Meier survival curves . The log - rank test was used to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of differences in disease - free survival distributions among prognostic groups . Variables achieving a signiﬁcance level of P < 0 . 05 in the univariate analysis were subsequently introduced in a forward stepwise proportional - hazard analysis ( Cox’s model ) to identify those variables independently associated with disease - free survival . Disease - free survival was established from the time of surgery to the Journal of Surgical Oncology TABLE I . Patient and Tumor Characteristics ( n ¼ 128 ) No .

VEGF and Cortactin Expression in Gastric Cancer 327 date when recurrence or death was detected . A P - value of < 0 . 05 was considered to be signiﬁcant . The statistical data were obtained using an SPSS software package ( SPSS 11 . 5 , Inc . , Chicago , IL ) . RESULTS Relation of Clinicopathological Factors According to VEGF and Cortactin Expression In cancer cells , it was generally the cytoplasm that revealed various intensity of positive reaction for VEGF and cortactin ( Fig . 1 ) . Of the 128 patients studied , 58 cases ( 45 . 3 % ) were strongly positive for VEGF , 16 cases ( 12 . 5 % ) were negative , and 54 cases ( 42 . 2 % ) revealed unclear weak reactions , the 70 cases were included in the negative group ( 54 . 7 % ) . The relationship between VEGF or cortactin expres - sion and clinicopathological features is shown in Table II . VEGF expression correlated with Lauren classiﬁcation ( P < 0 . 001 ) , patholo - gical tumor ( pT ) stage ( P < 0 . 001 ) , and pathological tumor node metastasis ( pTNM ) stage ( P ¼ 0 . 003 ) . No other clinicopathological parameter was related to VEGF expression . Seventy - one cases ( 55 . 5 % ) were strongly positive for cortactin , 20 cases ( 15 . 6 % ) were negative , and 37 cases ( 28 . 9 % ) revealed unclear weak reactions . Cortactin expression correlated with pN ( pathological lymph node ) stage ( P ¼ 0 . 018 ) , pTNM stage ( P < 0 . 001 ) , and degree of differentiation ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( Table II ) . Tumor Recurrence and Disease - Free Survival There were statistically signiﬁcant associations between tumor recurrence and VEGF expression ( P ¼ 0 . 023 ) , and cortactin expression ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( Table III ) . In univariate analysis by log - rank test , tumor location , pN stage , pM stage , pTNM stage , degree of differentiation , VEGF expression , and cortactin expression were signiﬁcant prognostic factors of disease - free survival ( P ¼ 0 . 007 , 0 . 025 , < 0 . 001 , 0 . 003 , 0 . 0031 , < 0 . 001 , and 0 . 001 , respectively ) ( Table IV ) . A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the independent prognostic roles of VEGF and cortactin expression after adjusting for other signiﬁcant covariates . All variables that signiﬁcantly affected survival in univariate analysis were introduced into a Cox proportional - hazard model ( Table V ) . At the end of the stepwise process , pTNM stage , VEGF expression , and cortactin expression maintained its independent prognostic inﬂuence on disease - free survival ( P < 0 . 001 , 0 . 022 , and 0 . 034 , respectively ) . The 3 - year disease - free survival rate for patients with VEGF negative / weak expression ( n ¼ 70 ) was 75 . 5 % , whereas patients with VEGF positive expression ( n ¼ 58 ) was 44 . 8 % ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . Patients with cortactin positive expression ( n ¼ 71 ) were associated with a worse 3 - year disease - free survival than patients with cortactin negative / weak expression ( n ¼ 57 ; 49 . 3 % vs . 78 . 5 % , P ¼ 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . DISCUSSION Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for gastric cancer . However , the prognosis after resection has remained unsatisfactory because of a high incidence of post - operative recurrence [ 8 ] . The identiﬁcation of variables in gastric tumor biology might lead to a more precise assessment of outcome and response to therapy . Molecular prognostic markers could potentially be represented by changes in gene copy number , mRNAexpression , or protein expression levels . Immunohistochemistry is the most practical method for assessing protein expression changes by histopathology . Immunohistochemistry not only provides a semiquantitative assessment of protein abundance but also deﬁnes the cellular localization of their expression . It may also detect functionally important post - translational protein modiﬁcations , such as phosphorylation . These considerations have led to the extensive use of immunohistochemistry in studies on prognostic markers for tumors [ 21 ] . Because no special processing of tissue samples is needed and labor - intensive and expensive molecular diagnostic techniques are avoided , immunohistochemistry is perhaps the most readily adaptable technique to clinical practice [ 22 ] . In the present study , we investigated the potential prognostic value of VEGF and cortactin expression by immunohistochemistry . VEGF induces the formation of new immature vessels , with basal membrane holes , favoring the progression of tumor cells into the vascular space . VEGF expression in gastric cancer has been associated with various clinicopathological parameters such as degree of differentiation [ 10 ] , intestinal - type tumors [ 23 ] , lymphatic invasion , and vascular invasion [ 5 ] . However , in the present study , we found VEGF expression correlated with Lauren classiﬁcation , pT stage , and pTNM stage . Numerous studies have demonstrated that VEGF Journal of Surgical Oncology TABLE III .

Cortactin is overexpressed in many types of human cancers , including head and neck and esophageal squamous carcinomas , colorectal , gastric , hepatocellular , breast and ovarian cancers [ 28 ] . In one previous study , overexpression of cortactin correlated with histological differentiation , T and N stage in gastric cancer [ 18 ] . Indeed , cortactin overexpression in our study was associated with pN stage , pTNM stage , and histological grade , which was similar as in the series of Tsai et al . In the present study , patients with cortactin positive expression were associated with a worse disease - free survival than patients with cortactin negative / weak expression . From the patholo - gist’s point of view , cortactin overexpression could be a useful and powerful prognosis marker for gastric cancer . In the multivariate analysis , VEGF expression and cortactin expression were independent prognostic factors of disease - free survival . In conclusion , VEGF and cortactin may be a good biomarker to be applied in clinic to predict the prognosis of patients with curatively resected gastric cancer . REFERENCES 1 .
