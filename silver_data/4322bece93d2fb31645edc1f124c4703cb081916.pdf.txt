Author Keywords Curation ; design ; design curation ; creativity ; collaboration ; zoomable user interfaces ; multiscale . Introduction Student design teams face creativity challenges , such as collaborative ﬁxation , evaluation apprehension , and free riding [ 3 , 12 ] . To address creativity problems , my research focuses on new ways for supporting collaboration in pro - cesses of design curation . We deﬁne design curation as , the ways in which designers organize artifacts to think about , represent , communicate , present , and archive de - sign processes [ 15 ] . Prior design curation methods include design workbooks [ 5 ] , mood boards [ 13 ] , annotated portfo - lios [ 2 ] , pictorials [ 1 ] . We choose to frame these activities through the lens of curation , which is the process of bring - ing together elements , to conceptualize and create a new Session : Graduate Student Symposium CC ’19 , June 23 – 26 , 2019 , San Diego , CA , USA 691 context , for purposes of reﬂection and communication [ 18 ] . My research question is : how can design curation spaces support a gradient of individual and collaborative creative processes ? To explore this question , I am developing a Col - laborative Design Curation ( CDC ) probe which supports groups of people working together , in real - time , to organize design artifacts in a shared zoomable space . The use of a ﬂexible , multiscale space seeks to capitalize on human spa - tial reasoning , to facilitate understanding , communication , collaboration , and creativity . To help reduce team design ﬁxation [ 21 ] , the CDC probe will incorporate role - based visual layers as a way to parti - tion territories [ 20 ] within the shared zoomable space . Fig - ures 1 , 2 , and 3 show the same design curation at three points of the team’s ideation process : dividing the curation space ( Figure 1 ) , working independently ( Figure 3 ) , and coming together ( Figure 2 ) . I hypothesize that role - based layers will support both shared awareness [ 4 ] and articula - tion work [ 19 ] among team members . Student design teams will be able to create layered spaces which can modulate individual and collaborative creative processes . Modulation , in this case , we use to encompass ways in which students vary their levels of participation or engagement between in - dividual and collaborative activities during group work . The CDC probe will provide a wide spectrum of collaborative conﬁguration options . We seek to highlight how transition - ing between points along this gradient can foster team har - mony or dissonance . Figure 3 shows an example curation from a student design team engaged in a design ideation process where they have used both spatial arrangement and role - based layers to coordinate their team activities . Figure 1 : Example collaborative design curation from the start of an ideation phases . The student design team divided their curation into quadrants , one for each member . They placed some information about the design task in the center . Figure 2 : Following their individual work stage , the team shares viewing permissions to their individual layers . to support discussing possible design proposals . Figure 3 : The team created separate layers for each member to work independently . Two students , Brian and Michael decided to combine their layers and work together . The ﬁgure shows their view of the curation space . They are able to see and manipulate each others’ curation elements , but other layers remain blurred . Background Prior research has investigated supporting designers in collaborating on design processes . TeamStorm enables co - located designers to work across personal and large collab - orative displays to organize and share their ideas [ 7 ] . Freed supports designers in reﬂecting on their processes , as well as integrating multiple types of media into a single design artifact , to help prevent fragmentation [ 17 ] . ReﬂectionSpace explores how design artifacts support communication and reﬂection - on - action [ 22 ] . Collaborative Design Curation extends prior work on free - form web curation , a type of new media—designed to sup - port users in creating new conceptual , spatial contexts—in which they discover and interpret relationships visually , while composing a variety of elements to form a connected Session : Graduate Student Symposium CC ’19 , June 23 – 26 , 2019 , San Diego , CA , USA 692 whole [ 10 ] . Free - form web curation supports visual thinking [ 16 ] and creatively engaging with prior work [ 10 ] . Collaborative Design Curation also builds on recent work on collaborative live media curation , which furthers free - form web curation , supporting not one , but multiple users collect - ing and assembling together [ 8 ] . Like collaborative live me - dia curation , collaborative design curation probe supports integrated live video and audio streaming within the cura - tion space . Inspiration for CDC’s focus on levels of scale and visual layers comes from observed practices of mul - tiscale design , in which designers use visual scale to ex - plore , juxtapose , and communicate relationships among de - sign elements [ 14 ] . The present investigation of collabora - tive design curation departs from prior curation probe stud - ies by focusing on supporting creativity in design teams . Research Methods We employ the technology probe method , in which pro - totypes are deployed in real - world settings to : meet user needs , ﬁeld test new techniques , gather qualitative and quantitative data , and inspire both users and researchers to think about the transformative potentials of new capa - bilities [ 9 ] . Through the deployment , we are able to gather qualitative and quantitative data . Qualitative data comes from interviews with students and instructors and from the created design curations as visual data . Quantitative data comes from the serialized representation of the design cu - rations and from collected operation logs . Figure 4 : This curation shows the students’ prototype development process . The instructor has added their suggestions about the prototype , in red . Their design collaborative has added a note , in blue . Feedback gathered from students and design instructors guides the development of the CDC probe . Before deploy - ing the CDC probe in a course , we work with the instructors to develop design curation tasks for the students . A version of the CDC probe , which does not include role - based layers , was recently used by 680 students across 6 courses in the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 semesters . This has resulted in 1043 design curations and millions of logged operations . These design curations come from a mix of both individual and team design tasks , depending on the speciﬁc course assignments . Because these curations were created before the inclusion of the proposed features , I plan to analyze them to form an initial data point . I will look at the curations and operation logs for evidence of collaborative activities , such as multiple students working in the space simultaneously or manip - ulating the same elements . These metrics , in addition to curation and ideation metrics [ 11 ] , will be used to measure effects of new collaborative design curation techniques . We plan on deploying the new CDC probe in two situated design studio undergraduate courses : Interactive Design Studio in the Visualization Sciences department , and Land - scape Architecture Design Studio . Data gathered from these course deployments will be analyzed with the de - veloped metrics and then compared to data collected from the previous version of the CDC probe . While these com - parisons will not be from identical courses , assignments , or participants , I assert that the comparison will be able to elicit interesting ﬁndings about the effectiveness of added features . I also plan on making comparisons between teams within a speciﬁc deployment contexts and comparing their respective creativity metrics and CDC feature usage . Layers for Creativity in Teams The developed CDC probe will include the novel technique of role - based visual layers to help prevent team ﬁxation . Fixation is a cognitive block that obstructs someone’s ideation process by keeping them mentally occupied with previously expressed ideas [ 23 ] . Prior work has shown that designers are more creative when they ﬁrst work individually , before being exposed to each others ideas [ 21 , 12 ] . Session : Graduate Student Symposium CC ’19 , June 23 – 26 , 2019 , San Diego , CA , USA 693 This work proposes that visual layers mechanisms , inspired by design tools such as Adobe Photoshop , can be com - bined with the CSCW notion of roles to affect team collabo - ration and creativity . Roles are a set of associated concerns and activities of users in a CSCW system [ 6 ] . Role - based layers will enable users to conﬁgurable differ - ent levels of access for both manipulation and visibility . I hypothesize that providing users with a gradient of visibility settings , such as blurred , or outline - only , will reduce team ﬁxation while still allowing for shared awareness of team - mates activities . Shared awareness is “an understanding of the activities of others , which provides a context for your own activity” [ 4 ] . A key aspect of awareness is shared feed - back , which is information about activities performed by users in a collaborative space . Similar to prior design tools , the CDC probe will support a gradient of layering possibilities through a scene index , an ordered list showing the visual stacking order of the lay - ers . The elements in lower layers appear behind elements in layers on top . Layers can be re - ordered on the Z - axis through the scene index . In tandem with enabling visual organization of content elements in layers , the new scene index will facilitate using the layers to organize cooperative work , based on roles and activities . Each layer in the scene index will enable setting CSCW permissions for visibility and manipulation . The curation space will initially support four layer visibilities : hidden , outline , blurred , and visible . The blurred and outline visibility will show shapes of elements in a layer , possibly with some color information , without showing the speciﬁc content of the elements . These visibilities are not intended for creating visual effects , but rather to hide the speciﬁcs of the layer from other collaborators , while still showing ap - proximations of their activity in the shared curation space . By seeing the blurred shapes or outlines of other members’ elements , users can continuously organize their curation , so that when the layers are viewed together , elements are not unintentionally covered ( shown in Figures 2 and 3 ) . Layers will provide conﬁgurable view and edit permissions . Students will be able to use layers to divide design tasks and separate individual work spaces . They can use layers to create spatial territories [ 20 ] and avoid collaborative ﬁxa - tion effects , while still using the shared space to relate their design team contributions . Layers will be useful for redlining and other instructional feedback processes . Redlining is the process of adding vi - sual critique on top of student design work . Instructors will redline by adding annotations or sketches in a new layer ( shown in Figure 4 ) . Redlining in the students’ design cura - tion will support instructors in conceptualizing and providing evaluation feedback and help students track feedback . Expected Contributions Through this research , I expect the following contributions : ( 1 ) collaborative design curation as a design methodology ; ( 2 ) role - based layers as a new technique for supporting shared awareness and ideation in zoomable spaces ; ( 3 ) evaluation methods for analyzing collaborative creativity ; ( 4 ) implications for facilitating creativity student design teams .
