HIP1 is an endocytic protein that influences transport and function of AMPA and NMDA receptors in the brain . However , little is known about its contribution to neuronal dysfunction in HD . We report that the Caenorhabditis elegans HIP1 homolog hipr - 1 modulates presynaptic activity and the abundance of synaptobrevin , a protein involved in synaptic vesicle fusion . Presynaptic function was also altered in hippocampal brain slices of HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice dem - onstrating delayed recovery from synaptic depression and a reduction in paired - pulse facilitation , a form of presynaptic plasticity . Interestingly , neuronal dysfunction in transgenic nematodes expressing mutant N - terminal huntingtin was specifically enhanced by hipr - 1 lossoffunction . Asimilareffectwasobservedwithseveralothermutantproteinsthatareexpressedatthesynapseandinvolvedin endocytosis , such as unc - 11 / AP180 , unc - 26 / synaptojanin , and unc - 57 / endophilin .

Moreover , synaptic proteins involved in endocytosis may protect neurons against amino acid homopolymer expansion . Key words : HIP1 ; synapse ; synaptic plasticity ; polyglutamine ; Huntington’s disease ; neurodegeneration Introduction Huntingtin - interacting protein 1 ( HIP1 ) was identified as an in - teracting partner of huntingtin ( htt ) , the protein whose gene is mutated in Huntington’s disease ( HD ) ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ; Wanker et al . , 1997 ) . Mutant htt contains an expanded polyglu - tamine ( polyQ ) tract that influences its interaction with HIP1 , suggesting a role in HD pathogenesis ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ; Hackam et al . , 2000 ; Gervais et al . , 2002 ) . HIP1 contains several conserved domains that are important for function including the following : an AP180 NH 2 - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain enabling membrane attachment , a central coiled - coil region , and a C - terminal THATCH domain ( Metzler et al . , 2001 ; Mishra et al . , 2001 ; Waelter et al . , 2001 ; Senetar et al . , 2004 ) . HIP1 has been implicated in numerous cel - lular processes . First , HIP1 partially colocalizes and copurifies with clathrin - coated vesicles and is involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis of cell surface receptors ( Metzler et al . , 2001 ; Mishra et al . , 2001 ; Waelter et al . , 2001 ) . Studies in primary neurons of HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice demonstrate altered clathrin - dependent AMPA receptor internalization , supporting a role of HIP1 in neuro - transmitter receptor endocytosis and the modulation of synaptic activity , in agreement with the enrichment of HIP1 in dendrites and at postsynaptic sites ( Metzler et al . , 2003 ; Okano et al . , 2003 ; Yao et al . , 2006 ) . Second , HIP1 has tumorigenic properties be - cause the overexpression of HIP1 is associated with prostate and colon cancers , perhaps by dysregulation of receptors including the epidermal growth factor receptor ( Rao et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . Additionally , a nuclear role for HIP1 has been discovered because it can regulate the transcriptional activity of the androgen recep - tor ( Mills et al . , 2005 ) . Third , HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice have complex phe - notypes demonstrating a role in development . HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice display spinal deformity early in adulthood and muscle wasting in their hindlimbs , show abnormal hematopoieses , and have re - productive defects associated with reduced sperm counts and ReceivedApril30 , 2007 ; revisedJuly30 , 2007 ; acceptedAug . 20 , 2007 .

Finally , the binding of HIP1 to mutant htt is altered by polyQ expansion and coexpression of HIP1 with mutant htt in HEK 293T cells induces caspase - dependent cell death in which free HIP1 binds to the related protein Hippi , recruiting caspase - 8 to initiate apoptosis ( Kalch - man et al . , 1997 ; Hackam et al . , 2000 ; Gervais et al . , 2002 ) . To better understand HIP1 function under normal and pathological conditions , we examined the Caenorhabditis elegans HIP1 homolog Huntingtin - interacting protein related 1 ( hipr - 1 ) . Here , we provide evidence that hipr - 1 influences cholinergic neu - rotransmission at the neuromuscular junction and alters the abundance of synaptobrevin along the ventral nerve cord . Addi - tionally , we demonstrate a role for HIP1 at CNS presynaptic nerve terminals in mice . Furthermore , neuronal dysfunction caused by mutant htt - exon1 was enhanced by hipr - 1 loss of func - tion ( LOF ) , suggesting a protective function of HIP1 . Finally , synaptic proteins regulating endocytosis and vesicle recycling also protected against polyQ toxicity indicating that synaptic ves - icle transport may be a site of mutant polyQ - induced neuronal dysfunction . Together , our data reveal a novel function for HIP1 at the presynaptic nerve terminal and show HIP1 belongs to a groupofsynapticproteinsthatprotectneuronsfromdysfunctioninducedbymutantpolyQs . Materials and Methods C . elegans handling , strain construction , and phenotypic characterization . All strains were maintained and handled following standard methods . The hipr - 1 insertion / deletion allele tm2207 was generated by the Na - tional Bioresource Project for the Nematode ( Tokyo , Japan ) . hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) consists of a 340 bp deletion corresponding to nucleotides 2928 – 3269 of cosmid ZK370 , along with the addition of 8 nt ( ATATTTTC ) . Thisinsertion / deletioneliminatesaportionofexon3and all of exon 4 creating a frameshift , leading to a stop codon after a 12 codon missense mutation . hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) was outcrossed seven times beforeanyanalysesweremade . Thepresenceofthe tm2207 deletioninall strainconstructionswasconfirmedbyPCR . Oligosusedtodetect tm2207 were as follows : tm2207 - f , AGGTCATCGTTCCAGATTCC ; tm2207 - r , GCATCGTCTGTCTGAGTTCT . Additional strains used include CB47 unc - 11 ( e47 ) , CB205 unc - 26 ( e205 ) , CB246 unc - 64 ( e246 ) , CB406 unc - 57 ( e406 ) , CB840 dpy - 23 ( e840 ) , CB1072 unc - 29 ( e1072 ) , DA509 unc - 31 ( e928 ) , DH1033 bIs1 [ vit - 2 : : GFP ] ( provided by B . Grant , Rutgers University , Piscataway , NJ ) , JT73 itr - 1 ( sa73 ) , NL2099 rrf - 3 ( pk1426 ) , NM204 snt - 1 ( md290 ) , and NM664 jsIs37 [ mec - 7 : : SNB - 1 : : GFP ] from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center , which is funded by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources . Defecation cycles were scored essentially as described previously ( Dal Santo et al . , 1999 ) . For statistical analyses , we first calculated a mean defecation cycle period for each animal , and then a mean and SEM for each strain . Touch tests were done as described previously by scoring for 10 touches at the tail of the animal for a minimum of 200 animals per genotype ( Parker et al . , 2001 ) . We used C . elegans transgenics expressing N - ter htt fused to CFP under the control of the mec - 3 promoter together with YFP under the control of the mec - 7 promoter ( Parker et al . , 2001 , 2005 ) . For the evaluation of the effects of HIP1 on polyQ - dependent neuronal dysfunction , polyQ transgenics were crossed to hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) , andthepresenceofthe tm2207 deletioninallstrainconstruc - tions was confirmed by PCR . RNA interference . RNA interference ( RNAi ) experiments were per - formed as described previously ( Kamath et al . , 2001 ) . Experiments were performed at least three times . The RNAi clone for hipr - 1 was obtained from Geneservice ( Cambridge , UK ) . The control RNAi vector for the progeny and defecation phenotypes was the plasmid L4417 , which pro - ducesdsRNAagainstgreenfluorescentprotein ( GFP ) . ThecontrolRNAi vector for the touch test experiments was the empty vector L4440 ( A . Fire , Stanford University , Stanford , CA ) . Wild - type N2 was used for the progeny count experiments , and the RNAi - sensitive mutation rrf - 3 ( pk1426 ) wasusedforthedefecationscoringexperiments . Forthetouch response experiments , we used RNAi - sensitive rrf - 3 ( pk1426 ) transgenics expressingN - terhtt ( 19Qor128Q ) fusedtoGFPunderthecontrolofthe mec - 3 promoter . Quantitative real - time PCR . Quantitative real - time PCR was done as described previously ( Parker et al . , 2005 ) . Microscopy . Worms were immobilized with 5 m M levamisole in M9 and mounted on 2 % agarose pads . Animals were mounted on an Axio - scope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) and observed with fluorescent fil - tersets . ImageswereacquiredwithaCCDcameraandMetaVuesoftware ( MolecularDevices , PaloAlto , CA ) . ToassessSNB - 1 : : GFPlevelsinliving animals , images were made from at least 100 animals for each strain over seven different trials using MetaVue software ( Molecular Devices ) . Op - timal image acquisition conditions were determined for wild - type con - trolsandidenticalcameragain , exposuresettings , andfluorescencefilters wereusedforallsubsequentquantitativestudies . Morphometricanalysis was used to obtain an average gray value of the GFP signals per animal and normalized to controls . The mean and SEM was calculated for each trial and two - tailed t tests were used for statistical analysis . Final figures for presentation were generated using Adobe Photoshop 7 . 0 ( Adobe Sys - tems , San Jose , CA ) . Pharmacological assays . Cholinergic neurotransmission was tested as described previously ( Lackner et al . , 1999 ) . Electrophysiology . HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) miceandwild - typelittermatesweretested in blind manner at 2 – 4 months of age . Mice were anesthetized and killed by decapitation , and the brain was quickly removed and kept in ice - cold artificial CSF ( ACSF ) consisting of the following : 124 m M NaCl , 26 m M NaHCO 3 , 10 m M [ SCAP ] D - glucose , 3 m M KCl , 2 m M CaCl 2 , 2 m M MgSO 4 , and 1 . 3 m M NaH 2 PO 4 , saturated with 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 . In some exper - iments , a 2 . 5 : 1 . 3 ratio of Ca 2 (cid:2) / Mg 2 (cid:2) was used . Hippocampal slices ( 450 (cid:1) m ) were maintained in ASCF at room temperature and during experi - ments were perfused with ACSF ( 30°C ) . In some experiments , 10 (cid:1) M bicuculline methiodide ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , 1 (cid:1) M CGP - 55845 [ ( 2 S ) - 3 - [ [ ( 15 ) - 1 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] amino - 2 - hydroxypropyl ] ( phenylmethyl ) phosphinic acid ] ( Tocris Bioscience , El - lisville , MO ) , and 50 (cid:1) M [ SCAP ] D - AP5 ( Sigma ) were added to block GABA A , GABA B , and NMDA receptors , respectively . Glass microelec - trodes containing ASCF lacking Ca 2 (cid:2) ( 3 M (cid:3) resistance ) were used to record field EPSPs ( fEPSPs ) . Synaptic responses were amplified using an Axopatch 1D ( Molecular Devices , Palo Alto , CA ) . Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using pCLAMP6 software . Whole - cell recordings ( EPSCs ) weremadeusingpatchpipetteswith ( 3 – 5M (cid:3) ) filled with intracellular solution containing the following : 130 m M Cs glu - conate , 30 m M HEPES , 11 m M EGTA , 10 m M KCl , 2 m M Mg - ATP , 2 m M QX - 314 ( lidocaine N - ethyl bromide ) ( Sigma ) , and 1 m M CaCl 2 , pH 7 . 25 and 290 mOsmol / L . The pipette was positioned onto CA1 pyramidal cell bodies using a 40 (cid:4) water immersion objective on a Nikon ( Tokyo , Ja - pan ) E600FN microscope equipped with a C2400 Hamamatsu ( Hamamatsu , Japan ) infraredcamera . Cellsthatdidnothavestablebase - linesynapticresponsesorinputresistancewerenotstudied . Weexcluded 5 of 20 neurons that had EPSCs that facilitated (cid:5) 120 % on 10 Hz stimu - lation . Nodifferencesinbreakthroughcellmembranepotentialorcapac - itance were detected between neurons from HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) and wild - type mice . CA1 synaptic responses were evoked with tungsten electrode stimula - tion of afferent fibers in the stratum radiatum . Stimulation intensity for experiments was adjusted to yield evoked synaptic responses that were 40 % of the maximal fEPSP size ( spike - free ) or EPSC size in patch - clamped neurons held at (cid:1) 70 mV holding potential . Statistical differ - ences were determined by Student’s t test . Statistical analysis . One - way ANOVA was used for statistics , and cor - rected for multiple testing with Tukey’s multiple comparison test unless otherwise noted . Parkeretal . • HIP1InfluencesSynapticActivity J . Neurosci . , October10 , 2007 • 27 ( 41 ) : 11056 – 11064 • 11057 Results Characterization of a hipr - 1 deletion mutant hipr - 1 , the C . elegans homolog of mammalian HIP1 and yeast SLA2p ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) , is located on chromosome III and maps to the ZK370 . 3 locus . The protein contains the ANTH , coiled - coil , and THATCH domains present in all HIP1 proteins . The coiled - coil domain in Sla2p and HIP1 enables binding to clathrin - light chain , although the exact mode of interaction dif - fers from yeast to mammals , suggesting differences in the regula - tion of intracellular transport among different species ( Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2005 ; Newpher et al . , 2006 ; Ybe et al . , 2007 ) . To investigate the function of hipr - 1 , we used a LOF insertion / deletion allele , designated hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) ( Fig . 1 ) and examined basal levels of receptor - mediated endocytosis using vit - 2 : : GFP , the C . elegans vitellogenin homolog YP170 ( a yolk protein ) fused to GFP ( Grant and Hirsh , 1999 ) .

This is in agreement with the observed lack of defects in transferrin uptake in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Metzler et al . , 2003 ) . hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) animals developed slower than wild type , typ - ically reaching adulthood several hours later than wild - type N2 at 20°C , and had several phenotypes . We observed that hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) animals were defective in defecation . In C . elegans , defecation is an ultradian rhythmical behavior under the control of the inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP3 ) receptor homolog itr - 1 , and consists of a repeat period of (cid:6) 45 s with three motor steps : posterior body wall muscle contraction , anterior body wall mus - cle contraction , and expulsion ( Thomas , 1990 ) . Strong itr - 1 mu - tations greatly extend the cycle time but the cycle remains peri - odic ( Dal Santo et al . , 1999 ) . We examined the role hipr - 1 in defecation with the tm2207 mutation and by RNA interference . The defecation motor program in hipr - 1 mutants and hipr - 1 ( RNAi ) animals was intact and maintained periodicity , but the mean defecation cycle was lengthened and was significantly dif - ferent from controls ( Fig . 2 A ) . Furthermore , hipr - 1 mutants had reduced brood sizes ( Fig . 2 B ) . RNAi experiments to knockdown hipr - 1 levels similarly reduced progeny number , worms from control RNAi experiments had normal progeny numbers , whereas itr - 1 ( sa73 ) animals had reduced progeny numbers in agreement with previous reports ( Dal Santo et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , hipr - 1 has important roles in brood size and the maintenance of the defecation rhythmic behavior . hipr - 1 modulates presynaptic function Next , we investigated neuronal function in hipr - 1 mutants . To this end , we used pharmacological indicators of neuronal trans - mission including aldicarb , an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor , or levamisole , a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist . Both com - pounds result in hyperactive cholinergic synapses , muscle hyper - contraction , and paralysis ( Nonet et al . , 1993 ) . Worms defective inpresynapticcalcium - dependentvesiclereleasewereresistantto aldicarb , whereas worms with postsynaptic defects were also re - sistant to levamisole . Similar to other worm mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins , we observed that hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) mutants were resistant to aldicarb , but sensitive to levamisole ( Fig . 3 A , B ) . These data suggest a role of hipr - 1 in presynaptic function and perhaps the regulation of neurotransmission and synaptic vesicle cycling . hipr - 1 modifies the accumulation of synaptobrevin in the ventral nerve cord To directly visualize effects of hipr - 1 on synaptic morphology and function , we examined the distribution of the synaptic protein synaptobrevin fused to GFP in living hipr - 1 mutants . Synapto - brevin is associated with synaptic vesicles and plays a role in regulating synaptic vesicle fusion at the synaptic terminal . The abundance of synaptobrevin at the plasma membrane is deter - mined by relative rates of exocytosis and endocytosis ( Dittman and Kaplan , 2006 ) . Defects in endocytosis result in the accumu - lation of synaptobrevin at the plasma membrane , whereas dys - function in exocytosis results in the accumulation of vesicles at nerve terminals . We examined the expression of a synaptobrevin GFP fusion protein ( SNB - 1 : : GFP ) that is expressed in mechanosensory neu - ronsbythe jsIs37 transgeneandistypicallyobservedasoneortwo large patches along the ventral nerve cord just posterior to the animals’ vulva ( Koushika et al . , 2004 ) . To assess the effect of hipr - 1 on SNB - 1 : : GFP expression , we constructed hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) ; SNB - 1 : : GFP animals and quantified the size and intensity of the GFP signals from these patches as average gray values using morphometric analysis . We observed a significant increase in the average gray value of the GFP signals in hipr - 1 mutants ( 1238 (cid:7) 60 ) versus the control jsIs37 strain ( 986 (cid:7) 27 ; t test , p (cid:5) 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 3 C ) . The accumu - lation of synaptobrevin at the synapse suggests dysregulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle perhaps because of the proposed func - tion of HIP1 in intracellular transport . This is consistent with the observation that other endocytic proteins , such as AP180 and endophilin A , have roles in the recycling of surface synaptobrevin and increase the surface fraction of synaptobrevin in C . elegans ( Sieburth et al . , 2005 ; Dittman and Kaplan , 2006 ) . These data suggest that hipr - 1 functions in mechanosensory neurons and regulates the distribution and function of presynaptic proteins . Recovery after synaptic depression is reduced in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice Synaptobrevin is a component of the vesicle fusion machinery and influences synaptic vesicle endocytosis , recycling , and neu - rotransmitter release ( Deak et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , HIP1 may be linked to neurotransmitter release by its regulation of synapto - brevin . To determine whether HIP1 has a role in presynaptic function in mammals , we examined neuronal activity in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Metzleretal . , 2003 ) . ThefunctionalroleforHIP1 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in vitro suggested that certain forms of synaptic vesicle recycling could be altered in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Metzler et al . , 2001 ) . Synaptic transmission at CNS presyn - aptic nerve terminals is normally maintained by a small pool of releasable and recycling synaptic vesicles [ (cid:6) 25 vesicles ( Sudhof , 2000 ) ] . This pool can be depleted by extensive stimulation and synaptic vesicle release becomes rate limiting and dependent on the regeneration of vesicles by clathrin - mediated endocytosis . To determine whether recovery from synaptic depression is altered in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , a prolonged stimulation paradigm ( 10 Hz ; 200 s ) was applied to deplete the releasable synaptic vesicle pool , and subsequent recovery was monitored by stimulating at a lower frequency ( 0 . 33 Hz ) ( Fig . 4 ) . The NMDA receptor blocker AP5 was included in the ACSF to prevent any tetanus - induced changes in synaptic transmission . Evoked synaptic responses ( EPSC , EPSP ) initially facilitated and subsequently depressed to a constant low level ( n (cid:8) 9 ) ( Fig . 4 A ) . The expanded time base in Figure 4 B shows that there was a trend toward a larger initial potentiation during the first 4 s of the tetanus in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice Figure 2 .

In ad - dition , the rate of recovery from synaptic depression was significantly impaired in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Fig . 4 C ) ( significance in - dicated by * p (cid:5) 0 . 05 ) . After 3 min of re - covery , the average EPSC amplitude amounted to 58 % of the baseline response in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice in contrast to wild - type mice that showed (cid:9) 86 % of recovery from depression . These results demonstrated that recovery of synaptic transmission at the presynaptic nerve terminal is impaired inHIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) miceaftersynapticdepression induced by prolonged nerve stimulation . HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice exhibit enhanced paired - pulse facilitation The larger initial facilitation during the synaptic depression experiments in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) neurons suggests that alter - ations in short - term synaptic plasticity occur in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Most synapses , including hippocampal CA1 – CA3 , sup - port various forms of plasticity in re - sponse to two or more stimuli . We first studied paired - pulse facilitation ( PPF ) , in which delivery of two stimuli within a second of each other produces an in - crease in the size of the second synaptic response ( Magelby , 1987 ) . This increase in neurotransmitter release is thought to result from residual presynaptic Ca 2 (cid:2) that is still present after the first impulse , thereby increasing the probability of neurotransmitter release after invasion of the second action potential ( Wu and Saggau , 1994 ; Kamiya and Ozawa , 1998 ) . PPF was studied at different in - terpulse intervals between 40 and 600 ms . The sample fEPSP traces shown in Figure 5 A were evoked by delivery of paired pulses between 40 and 60 ms . A significant increase in PPF at interpulse intervals between 60 and 600 ms is evi - dent in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice compared with wild - type littermates ( Fig . 6 B ) ( t test , * p (cid:5) 0 . 04 ) . Thus , increased facilitation of neurotransmitter release occurs in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice when presynaptic neu - rons receive pairs of action potentials within hundreds of milliseconds of each other . To determine whether enhanced fa - cilitation persists under conditions fa - voring greater neurotransmitter release , synaptic responses were recorded under elevated Ca 2 (cid:2) concentrations . Raising the extracellular Ca 2 (cid:2) concentration is known to increase the probability of neurotransmitter release and leads to a decrease in PPF , because the initially high release probability acts as a ceiling and limits additional enhancement ( Wu and Saggau , 1994 ; Kamiya and Ozawa , 1998 ) . Under these conditions , PPF was still enhanced in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice but the difference was no longer statistically significant in comparison with wild - type littermates ( Fig . 5 C ) ( n (cid:8) 20 and 17 , respectively ; t test , p (cid:9) 0 . 12 ) . Thus , a lack of HIP1 affects the extent of PPF but not the Ca 2 (cid:2) dependency of this form of short - term synaptic plasticity . hipr - 1 protects against mutant polyglutamine - mediated neuronal dysfunction Changes in synaptic function have been observed in several mouse models of HD ( Cepeda et al . , 2007 ) .

In this system , the expression of mutant N - terminal htt ( 128Q ) fused to a fluorescent protein in the touch receptor neu - rons causes polyQ - dependent impairment of mechanosensation without cell death , an effect which can be rescued by mutation in genetic pathways associated with longevity and stress response ( Parker et al . , 2005 ) . The touch response of hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) mutants alone ( 83 (cid:7) 1 % ) was indistinguishable from wild - type animals ( 80 (cid:7) 1 % ) , suggesting that hipr - 1 does not contribute to normal mech - anosensation . However , touch response in 128Q animals was im - paired by 50 % in hipr - 1 mutants and by RNAi - knockdown , with no change in 19Q control animals ( Fig . 6 A ) . Enhancement of neuronal dysfunction by hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) was not attributable to changes in 128Q transgene expression because 128Q mRNA lev - els were nearly identical in 128Q controls ( 1 . 0 (cid:7) 0 . 2 ) compared with hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) ; 128Q animals ( 1 . 1 (cid:7) 0 . 2 ) as determined by quantitative real - time PCR . The touch receptor neurons at the tail ( PLM cells ) of 128Q transgenic worms show strong axonal aggregation of htt - fusion proteins and dystrophy of axonal processes , including axonal swelling ( Parker et al . , 2001 ) . We observed no change in the fre - quency of aggregates along axonal pro - cesses of hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) ; 128Q animals compared with 128Q alone ( Fig . 6 B ) . Fur - thermore , we observed no change in the frequency of axonal swelling versus con - trols ( Fig . 6 B ) . Next , we tested whether the effect of hipr - 1 LOF on PLM cell activity in mutant polyQ animals could be attributed to de - fects in PLM cell differentiation by exam - ining whether neurodevelopmental ab - normalities exist . For this purpose , we used two reporters for axonal outgrowth and guidance , including the following : mec - 7 : : YFP that is expressed primarily in the mechanosensory neurons and unc - 47 : : GFP expressed in the GABAergic motor neurons . We observed no differ - ence in neuronal morphology between hipr - 1 ( tm2207 ) mutants and control strains ( data not shown ) . Together , these data indicated that hipr - 1 protects against neuronal dysfunction induced by mutant polyQs , likely acting at the synapse . Synaptic endocytic proteins protect against mutant polyQ toxicity in nematode neurons With a putative role for hipr - 1 in regu - lating synaptic function and protection against mutant polyQ toxicity , we exam - ined other known regulators of synaptic function including homologues of syn - taxin ( unc - 64 ) , synaptotagmin ( snt - 1 ) , the clathrin adaptin protein AP180 ( unc - 11 ) , synaptojanin ( unc - 26 ) , endophilin A ( unc - 57 ) , and the mu2 subunit of adaptor protein complex 2 ( dpy - 23 ) . The contribution of each mutation to wild - type touch was assessed , and each mutant examined had in - creased touch insensitivity ( Fig . 6 C ) . These data demonstrate that these genes are required for normal mechanosensation . To determine whether any particular synaptic protein modulated mutant polyQ neurotoxicity , we constructed dou - ble mutants expressing either 19Q or 128Q transgenes for each LOF mutant . Mutations that impaired the exocytosis portion of the synaptic cycle , including unc - 64 / syntaxin , enhanced neuronal dysfunction for both control 19Q and mutant 128Q animals ( Fig . 6 D ) . This is likely a non - polyQ - related effect of transgene expression . snt - 1 / synaptotagmin enhanced 128Q toxicity , but the effects on 19Q could not be examined because we consistently failed to isolate snt - 1 ; 19Q animals . We cannot rule out the possibility of genetic linkage between the 19Q transgene and snt - 1 . However , mutants that affected the en - docytosis portion of the cycle enhanced mutant 128Q toxicity with no significant effects compared with 19Q control strains . Mutation in unc - 11 / AP180 and unc - 26 / synaptojanin en - hanced 128Q toxicity to a level comparable with hipr - 1 , mu - tation in unc - 57 / endophilin A was more severe , whereas mu - tation of dpy - 23 / mu2 subunit of adaptor protein complex 2 had no effect ( Fig . 6 D ) . Thus , genes that function in synaptic endocytosis may protect against mutant polyQ toxicity , indi - cating that mutant polyQs may alter synaptic endocytosis . Figure4 .

Parkeretal . • HIP1InfluencesSynapticActivity J . Neurosci . , October10 , 2007 • 27 ( 41 ) : 11056 – 11064 • 11061 Discussion Several studies suggest a function for HIP1 in intracellular transport of cell surface re - ceptors influencing neuronal activity in the CNS ( Metzler et al . , 2003 , 2007 ) . How - ever , the contribution of HIP1 to neuronal pathology in HD is unclear . Here , we pro - vide evidence for a presynaptic function of HIP1 . This is based on the resistance of C . elegans hipr - 1 mutant motorneurons to al - dicarb and changes in presynaptic plastic - ity and recovery from synaptic depression in hippocampal brain slices from HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice . Moreover , HIP1 and sev - eral other presynaptic proteins protect C . elegans neurons from mutant polyQ toxicity . Previous studies have shown HIP1 lo - calization at primarily postsynaptic sites . This is in agreement with the occurrence of postsynaptic defects in neurotransmit - ter receptor function and transport in neurons from HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice ( Metzler et al . , 2003 , 2007 ; Okano et al . , 2003 ; Yao et al . , 2006 ) . In this study , we provide the first evidence for a function of HIP1 at the presynaptic nerve terminal . In both nem - atodes and mice , we observed HIP1 al - tered neurotransmitter release based on the use of pharmacological and electrophysiological indicators , respectively . Reduced recovery from synaptic depression in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice indicates potential defects in endocytosis of synaptic vesicles . This defect could result from lack of HIP1 endocytic function . An alternative explanation is that the subcellular localization of syn - aptobrevin is altered in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , thereby influencing en - docytosis of synaptic vesicles . It is known that cultured synapses from synaptobrevin - 2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice have slower recovery of synaptic responses subsequent to depletion induced by hypertonic solu - tion ( Deak et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , neurotransmitter release is greatly reduced in these mice , unlike HIP1 mutants , which do not show any differences in release ( data not shown ) . It is also inter - esting that synaptobrevin - 2 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice show enhanced facilitation ; we detected a small but significant reduction in paired - pulse fa - cilitation in HIP1 mutants when bathed in saline containing a 2 : 2 m M ratio of calcium / magnesium saline . However , this difference was restored in saline containing a higher ratio that favors release . These data also raise the question of whether calcium dynamics are altered in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , especially because calcium regulates not only exocytosis but also endocytosis ( Abenavoli et al . , 2001 ) . Future studies are needed to determine whether HIP1 influences vesicle release through altered synaptobrevin distribution in HIP1 (cid:1) / (cid:1) mice , whether HIP1 has direct effects on the vesicle release machinery independent of synaptobrevin , or whether HIP1 modulates presynaptic calcium and clathrin - mediated endocytosis . A potential role of HIPR - 1 in endocytosis awaits future exper - imentation . Nevertheless , the ability of HIP1 and Sla2p to bind to clathrin light chain suggests conservation of this function from yeast to mammals . In fact , a clathrin light chain binding site was recently identified in the coiled - coil domain of HIP1 family members , which corresponds to 483 ADLLRKN in human HIP1 and KDEQIKN in yeast ( Chen and Brodsky , 2005 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2005 ; Newpher et al . , 2006 ; Ybe et al . , 2007 ) . A similar sequence is present in HIPR - 1 and corresponds to 458 KDEEITA . This suggests clathrin light chain binding and reg - ulation of clathrin - mediated endocytosis by HIPR - 1 . Still , the mode of clathrin light chain binding and clathrin assembly may differ from human HIP1 as evidenced by the lack of clathrin heavy chain and AP2 binding sites in HIPR - 1 . HIP1 interacts with htt and , therefore , may be a modifier of mutant polyQ cytotoxicity as previously suggested for other htt - interacting proteins ( Holbert et al . , 2001 ; Steffan et al . , 2001 ; Goehler et al . , 2004 ; Bae et al . , 2005 ) . We found that hipr - 1 LOF enhanced touch insensitivity in mutant polyQ transgenic animals independent of aggregation and axonal dystrophy phenotypes , suggesting exacerbation of a defect in synaptic transmission . Our findings that HIP1 modulates presynaptic activity together with the modulation of mutant polyQ cytotoxicity in neurons provide direct evidence for a protective effect of synaptic proteins against mutant polyQ . This hypothesis is supported by the observation that other synaptic proteins involved in endocytosis like unc - 11 / AP180 , unc - 26 / synaptojanin , and unc - 57 / endophilin are protec - tive against mutant polyQs . The most severe enhancement of mutant polyQ toxicity was observed with a LOF in unc - 57 / en - dophilin A . This is consistent with the previous observation that mutant htt - exon 1 fragments have enhanced binding to endophi - lin A3 ( Sittler et al . , 1998 ) . The role of HIP1 and other synaptic proteins on mutant polyQ cytotoxicity were studied in nematodes expressing N - terminal htt . Additional studies will be needed to determine whetherasimilareffectoccursinmammalianneuronsexpressingfull - length mutant htt . Nonetheless , it is notable that the gener - ation of an N - terminal htt fragment is a crucial step in the patho - genesis of HD ( Crocker et al . , 2006 ; Graham et al . , 2006 ) .

Neurosci . , October10 , 2007 • 27 ( 41 ) : 11056 – 11064 Parkeretal . • HIP1InfluencesSynapticActivity An involvement of HIP1 in the pathogenesis of HD is consis - tent with the observation that mutant htt impairs neurotransmis - sion in mouse models of HD ( Usdin et al . , 1999 ; Li et al . , 2000 ; Laforet et al . , 2001 ; Zeron et al . , 2002 ; Vetter et al . , 2003 ) . Mutant htt has been shown to directly interact with the cellular machin - ery required for synaptic transmission and neuronal function including PACSIN 1 / syndapin , syntaxin , endophilin A , and N type channels ( Sittler et al . , 1998 ; Modregger et al . , 2002 ; Singa - raja et al . , 2002 ; Swayne et al . , 2005 ) . Our data are consistent with a role for defective endocytosis as an underlying mechanism in HD ( Trushina et al . , 2006 ) . Importantly , mouse knock - outs of synaptic and / or htt - interacting proteins such as HIP1 ( Ferguson et al . , 2000 ; Metzler et al . , 2007 ; Nystuen et al . , 2007 ) often have neurological phenotypes that may be relevant to HD pathogenesis . In conclusion , we identified an important conserved role for HIP1 in the regulation of presynaptic function and the modula - tion of polyQ cytotoxicity . Exacerbation of polyQ cytotoxicity was also observed with LOF mutants for other endocytic proteins influencing transport and neurotransmitter release . This is con - sistent with the notion that htt partner proteins may modify the cytotoxicity of mutant htt , which may potentially influence HD symptoms ( Holbert et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , together with our previ - ous study of longevity modulators ( Parker et al . , 2005 ) , our data indicate that C . elegans transgenics expressing mutant polyQs in neurons are useful to search for modifier genes and active com - pounds that may restore a normal synapse before evaluation in mammalian models of HD pathogenesis and samples from HD patients .
