Integrins are important laminin receptors , but their binding site on the heterotrimeric laminins is poorly deﬁned structurally . We report the crystal structure at 2 . 13 A˚ resolution of a minimal integrin - binding fragment of mouse laminin - 111 , consisting of (cid:1) 50 residues of a 1 b 1 g 1 coiled coil and the ﬁrst three laminin G - like ( LG ) domains of the a 1 chain . The LG domains adopt a triangular arrangement , with the C terminus of the coiled coil situated be - tween LG1 and LG2 . The critical integrin - binding glutamic acid residue in the g 1 chain tail is surface exposed and predicted to bind to the metal ion - dependent adhesion site in the integrin b 1 subunit . Additional contacts to the integrin are likely to be made by the LG1 and LG2 surfaces adjacent to the g 1 chain tail , which are notably conserved and free of obstructing glycans . INTRODUCTION Basement membranes ( BMs ) are a type of extracellular matrix that underlies all epithelia and surrounds muscle , fat , and periph - eral nerve cells ( Yurchenco , 2011 ) . BMs are composed of a char - acteristic set of evolutionarily ancient glycoproteins : laminins , type IV and type XVIII collagens , nidogen , and perlecan ( Hynes , 2012 ) . BM assembly begins with the polymerization of laminins at the cell surface ; this process requires cellular receptors , including integrins , a - dystroglycan , and sulfated carbohydrates ( Hohenester and Yurchenco , 2013 ) . Integrin - mediated cell adhe - sion to laminins is essential for embryo development and for tis - sue function in adult animals ( Yamada and Sekiguchi , 2015 ; Yurchenco , 2011 ) . Disruption of the laminin - integrin interaction causes a severe skin - blistering disorder in humans ( Has and Ny - strom , 2015 ) ; the interaction is also perturbed in many cancers ( Ramovs et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , integrin - mediated adhesion to laminin supports the long - term self - renewal of stem cells in cul - ture ( Miyazaki et al . , 2012 ; Rodin et al . , 2010 ) . Laminins are large heterotrimers composed of one of ﬁve a chains , one of three b chains , and one of three g chains ( Aumail - ley et al . , 2005 ) . The laminin - binding integrins a 3 b 1 , a 6 b 1 , a 7 b 1 , and a 6 b 4 have distinct speciﬁcities for the 15 known laminin heterotrimers ( Nishiuchi et al . , 2006 ) . Laminin - 111 ( a 1 b 1 g 1 ) was originally puriﬁed from the Engelbreth - Holm - Swarm ( EHS ) mouse tumor and has been extensively studied for nearly 40 years . The N - terminal regions of the a 1 , b 1 , and g 1 chains form the short arms of the cross - shaped laminin molecule , and their C - terminal regions associate to form a long a - helical coiled coil ( Beck et al . , 1990 ) . The a 1 chain continues for another (cid:1) 1 , 000 residues after the coiled coil , which are folded into ﬁve consecutive laminin G - like ( LG ) domains ( Timpl et al . , 2000 ) . It has long been known that integrin binding requires the native quaternary structure of laminin : ﬁrst , a proteolytic laminin - 111 fragment termed E8 ( (cid:1) 220 residues of coiled coil and LG1 - LG3 ) was shown to be sufﬁcient for integrin - mediated cell adhe - sion , but the activity was lost when E8 was dissociated into its constituent chains ( Deutzmann et al . , 1990 ) . Second , a glutamic acid in the third position from the C terminus of the g 1 chain ( Glu1605 in mouse g 1 ) was shown to be essential for integrin binding to laminin - 511 , but the isolated g 1 tail was inactive ( Ido et al . , 2007 ) . A structural explanation for these observations has been difﬁcult to obtain , however . Here , we report the crystal structure of the integrin - binding region of laminin , which reveals that the critical g 1 tail lies on top of the LG1 and LG2 domains of the a chain . We propose that integrins recognize this composite surface on the laminin heterotrimer . RESULTS Structure Determination To obtain a heterotrimeric laminin fragment amenable to crystal - lization , we shortened the coiled coil of the E8 fragment from (cid:1) 220 to (cid:1) 50 residues . Our design of this mini - E8 fragment was inspired by a peptide study , which showed that (cid:1) 50 resi - dues are sufﬁcient for a stable laminin a 2 b 1 g 1 coiled coil ( No - mizu et al . , 1996 ) . Co - expression of the a 1 , b 1 , and g 1 chains of mini - E8 resulted in a stable heterotrimer with the expected di - sulﬁde bond between the b 1 and g 1 chains ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . HT1080 ﬁbrosarcoma cells , which adhere to laminin - 111 and E8 using integrin a 6 b 1 ( Brown and Goodman , 1991 ; Deutzmann et al . , 1990 ) , adhered equally well to mini - E8 , and cell adhesion was abrogated by mutation of the critical integrin - binding resi - due , g 1 E1605Q ( Figure 1C ) . The crystal structure of enzymati - cally deglycosylated mini - E8 was determined to a resolution of 2 . 13 A ˚ ( Table 1 ) . The crystallographic model is complete except for residues 2 , 539 – 2 , 546 in a 1 LG3 and the last two residues of g 1 . 530 Structure 25 , 530 – 535 , March 7 , 2017 ª 2017 The Author ( s ) .

Overall Structure of Laminin - 111 Mini - E8 The three LG domains of the a 1 chain in mini - E8 are arranged in a triangle ( Figure 1D ) , in agreement with negative - stain electron micrographs of laminin - 111 ( Bruch et al . , 1989 ) . The coiled coil of mini - E8 is attached perpendicularly to the LG1 - LG3 triangle , with its C terminus located between LG1 and LG2 . In a previous crystal structure of the isolated LG1 - LG3 domains of the laminin a 2 chain , LG1 was completely dissociated from LG2 and LG3 ( Carafoli et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , the presence of the coiled coil is required to establish the triangular LG arrangement in mini - E8 . Of the three helices making up the coiled coil , the a 1 helix is closest to the center of the triangle . LG1 interacts extensively with the coiled coil ( see below ) . The LG1 - LG2 linker passes near the C terminus of the coiled coil and places LG2 on the opposite side of the coiled coil . The association of LG2 with the coiled coil is remarkably tenuous : apart from a single direct Figure 1 .

Data shown are represen - tative of four independent experiments . ( D ) Two orthogonal views of the mini - E8 crystal structure . The disulﬁde bond linking the C termini of the b 1 and g 1 chains is shown in orange . The Ca 2 + ions in LG1 and LG2 are shown as salmon - colored spheres . The C - terminal residue of the g 1 chain in this structure is Glu1605 . See also Figure S1 . interaction involving a 1 Tyr2483 , all the contacts are mediated by water molecules . The interface between LG2 and LG3 is also dominated by water - mediated contacts . LG3 is farthest from the coiled coil and closes the triangle by forming an extensive interface with LG1 . The b 1 and g 1 helices are connected by a disulﬁde bridge near their C termini . The g 1 chain extends for another seven residues , which fold over the a 1 LG1 - LG2 linker and position the crit - ical g 1 Glu1605 residue on the surface be - tween the LG1 and LG2 domains ( Figure 1 ) . The mini - E8 structure is in excellent agreement with a recent crosslinking study of laminin - 111 ( Armony et al . , 2016 ) . The authors observed crosslinks from a 1 Lys2119 to LG1 , LG2 , and the LG2 - LG3 linker , consistent with the location of Lys2119 in the penultimate turn of the a 1 helix and its side chain pointing toward the center of the LG1 - LG3 triangle ( Fig - ure S1A ) . Furthermore , crosslinks were observed from g 1 Lys1606 ( adjacent to the critical g 1 Glu1605 ) to LG1 and LG2 , consistent with the position of the g 1 tail in our structure ( Figure S1B ) . The Heterotrimeric Coiled Coil of Mini - E8 The coiled coil in mini - E8 spans seven heptad repeats , the ﬁrst two of which have weak electron density . The heptads adopt the standard arrangement ( Cohen and Parry , 1990 ) , with pre - dominantly aliphatic residues in the a and d positions forming the core of the helical bundle ( Figure 2 ) . Unusually for a coiled coil , the a 1 helix is completely straight , except for a kink at Pro2095 . When the coiled coil is viewed from its C terminus , a 1 , b 1 , and g 1 are arranged in a counterclockwise order . Our mini - E8 structure thus conﬁrms the register and chain order proposed in the recent crosslinking study ( Armony et al . , 2016 ) . Sequence comparison shows that the very C terminus of Structure 25 , 530 – 535 , March 7 , 2017 531 the coiled coil is conserved in all laminin isoforms ( Figure 2 ) . However , the a 4 and a 5 chains deviate from the regular heptad pattern in the N - terminal half of the mini - E8 coiled coil , and may require additional regions for stable association with the b and g chains . Interactions Involving the C Terminus of the Coiled Coil The b 1 helix of the coiled coil is continuous all the way to the C - terminal b 1 - g 1 disulﬁde bond . In contrast , the a 1 and g 1 heli - ces terminate two turns earlier , and their C - terminal regions interact with each other and with LG1 ( Figure 3A ) . The a 1 chain straightens after Ile2124 to become the ﬁrst b strand of LG1 at Ala2127 . The g 1 chain bulges after Pro1595 , with the side chain of Phe1599 pointing back toward Pro1595 . The opening of the coiled coil near its C terminus creates a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the a 1 LG1 residue Trp2293 , thereby estab - lishing the intimate interface between LG1 and the coiled coil ( Figure 3A ) . Sequence comparison suggests that similar quater - nary interactions are formed in all laminin heterotrimers : aromatic residues corresponding to a 1 Trp2293 and Tyr2295 are present in all other a chains ( Carafoli et al . , 2009 ) , and a proline corre - sponding to g 1 Pro1595 is present in all g chains ( Figure 2 ) . The g 1 tail , which is critical for integrin binding ( Ido et al . , 2007 ) , is almost entirely resolved in our mini - E8 structure ; only the Glu1605 side chain and the C - terminal two residues are missing ( Figure 3B ) . The side chain of g 1 Asn1600 ( conserved in all verte - brate g 1 sequences ) forms two hydrogen bonds with the two C - terminal peptide carbonyl groups of the b 1 helix . Further along , the g 1 tail forms two main - chain hydrogen bonds with the a 1 LG1 - LG2 linker . Thus , a complex network of quaternary interactions organizes the C - terminal region of the coiled coil , including the g 1 tail . We note that the LG1 and LG2 surfaces on either side of the g 1 tail are more highly conserved than LG3 , and that none of the ﬁve N - linked glycosylation sites of mini - E8 are located in this region ( Figure 3C ) . The LG1 - LG3 Interface The LG1 - LG3 interface is the largest interdomain contact in mini - E8 ( Figure S2 ) , yet the interface residues are not conserved in other laminin a chains . For instance , a 1 LG3 residue Ala2661 , which points into a snug pocket on the LG1 surface , is replaced by arginine in the a 3 , a 4 , and a 5 chains ( Carafoli et al . , 2009 ) . The lack of conservation in this region sharply contrasts the strict conservation of quaternary interactions near the C terminus of the coiled coil , and suggests that the precise nature of the LG1 - LG3 interface may be less important , as long as a circular LG1 - LG2 - LG3 structure is established . DISCUSSION The broad features of the quaternary structure of laminins were established many years ago ( Beck et al . , 1990 ) . Since then , crystal structures have been determined of several key regions ( Carafoli et al . , 2012 ; Hohenester and Yurchenco , 2013 ; Moran et al . , 2015 ; Pulido et al . , 2016 ) , but the coiled coil and the integ - rin - binding region have deﬁed all crystallographic attempts to date . Our high - resolution crystal structure of laminin - 111 mini - E8 now reveals how the coiled coil is integrated into the LG tan - dem , and provides a satisfying explanation as to why no single laminin chain is sufﬁcient for integrin binding ( Yamada and Seki - guchi , 2015 ) . The identiﬁcation of g 1 Glu1605 as a key residue for integrin a 6 b 1 binding suggested two possible scenarios : either this res - idue binds directly to the integrin , or it is required to organize the LG tandem into a competent conformation ( Ido et al . , 2007 ) . Our structure strongly favors the ﬁrst scenario . Because the g 1 tail is located on the surface and appears to be quite mobile , it is difﬁ - cult to imagine how g 1 Glu1605 could be essential for quater - nary structure . It is more likely that this acidic residue is the ligand for the metal ion - dependent adhesion site in the integrin b 1 subunit , similarly to the aspartic acid of the famous Arg - Gly - Asp motif in the Fn10 domain of ﬁbronectin ( Xiong et al . , 2002 ) . This interpretation is in line with results from exhaustive muta - genesis of the laminin a 5 chain , which failed to identify acidic residues within the LG1 - LG3 region that are essential for integ - rin binding ( Yamada and Sekiguchi , 2015 ) . In ﬁbronectin , the so - called synergy site in the Fn9 domain makes additional contacts to the integrin a subunit ( Nagae et al . , 2012 ) . In laminin - 111 , an equivalent function may be provided by the conserved LG1 and LG2 surfaces adjacent to the g 1 tail . This interpretation would be consistent with the ﬁnding that the integrin speciﬁcity of lam - inin heterotrimers is largely determined by the a chain ( Nishiuchi et al . , 2006 ) . It is also noteworthy that the epitopes of two func - tion - blocking antibodies map to the LG1 and LG2 domains , respectively ( Ido et al . , 2006 ; Yamashita et al . , 2010 ) . Because no structure of a laminin - binding integrin is available , and Table 1 .

The requirement of LG3 for function is likely to be indirect : removal of LG3 ( Ido et al . , 2004 ) would destabilize the quaternary structure , and replace - ment with LG3 from another a chain ( Kikkawa et al . , 2007 ) would not be tolerated because of the lack of conservation in the LG1 - LG3 interface . In summary , our structure of the integrin - binding region of lam - inin - 111 rationalizes a large number of biochemical ﬁndings and provides the framework for future studies into the mechanism of laminin recognition by integrins .

In brief , 293F cells were grown in a shaking incubator at 37 (cid:3) C with 8 % CO 2 in serum - free FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium to a cell density of 10 6 cells / mL . The cells were cotransfected with the respective expression vectors at a 1 : 1 : 1 molar ratio . Transfections were performed using polyethylenimine ( PEI ; VWR Figure 2 .

The conditioned media containing the secreted heterotrimers were collected 72 hr after transfec - tion . The ﬁltered media were adjusted to a ﬁnal concentration of 20 mM Na - HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) and loaded onto 5 - mL HisTrap excel columns ( GE Healthcare ) using an A¨kta pure chromatography system ( GE Healthcare ) . The columns were washed with 20 mM Na - HEPES and 150 mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , and the proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mM imidazole .

Twenty - four hours after transfection the conditioned medium was collected , and the transfected cells were resus - pended in fresh kifunensine - containing medium , and further incubated for 48 hr . The protein was puriﬁed from the combined conditioned media using HisTrap afﬁnity chromatography and concentrated to 1 mg / mL . This protein solution was then dialyzed into 20 mM Tris - HCl and 150 mM NaCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) and simultaneously digested with His - tagged TEV protease and His - tagged EndoH endoglycosidase ( made in E . coli using expression vectors kindly pro - vided by Stephen Curry and Daniel Leahy , respectively ) at enzyme : substrate ratios of 1 : 10 for 18 hr at room temperature . The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 1 - mL HisTrap FF column ( GE Healthcare ) and the ﬂowthrough collected . The ﬁnal puriﬁcation step was done by size - exclusion chromatog - raphy , as described above . Cell Adhesion Assay Cell adhesion assays were performed using HT1080 human ﬁbrosarcoma cells ( ATCC ) . The cells were grown at 37 (cid:3) C with 5 % CO 2 in DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine serum . Twenty - four - well plates ( Corning Life Sciences ) were coated with 100 nM mouse EHS tumor laminin - 111 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , recombi - nant E8 , recombinant mini - E8 , or the respective g 1 E1605Q mutants , at 4 (cid:3) C overnight . The following day , the wells were blocked with 2 % BSA in PBS for 2 hr at room temperature . HT1080 cells were harvested , centrifuged , and resuspended in serum - free DMEM at a density of 3 3 10 5 cells / mL , and then plated on the coated wells . After incubation at 37 (cid:3) C for 30 min , the attached cells were ﬁxed , stained with Diff - Quik ( International Reagents ) , and photographed using an inverted microscope . Reductive Methylation Deglycosylated mini - E8 was reductively methylated using the Reductive Alkylation Kit ( Hampton Research ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . In brief , 1 mL of a 5 mg / mL solution of mini - E8 was reacted with dimethylamine borane complex solution and formaldehyde at 4 (cid:3) C for 22 hr . The reaction was stopped by addition of glycine . The reaction mixture was concentrated using a Vivaspin device and further puriﬁed by size - exclusion chromatography , as described above .

A mos - quito Nanolitre Robot ( TTP Labtech ) was used to set up 200 nL drops . The initial crystals of deglycosylated and methylated mini - E8 were obtained in the JCSG + screen ( Molecular Dimensions ) using a protein concentration of 17 mg / mL and 0 . 02 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate , 0 . 1 M Na - HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) , and 22 % ( w / v ) poly ( acrylic acid sodium salt ) 5 , 100 as precipitant . Larger crystals were grown in 2 m L hanging drops using the same precip - itant solution . After 2 weeks , the crystals were ﬂash - frozen in liquid nitro - gen using reservoir solution supplemented with 20 % ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant . Crystal Structure Determination Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline I04 - 1 of the Diamond Light Source ( Oxfordshire , UK ) . The data were processed using XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) and programs of the CCP4 suite ( Winn et al . , 2011 ) as im - plemented in the xia2 pipeline ( Winter et al . , 2013 ) . CC 1 / 2 was used to determine the resolution limit ( Karplus and Diederichs , 2012 ) . The phases were determined by molecular replacement using PHASER as imple - mented in the PHENIX suite ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) . The search models were derived from the crystal structure of the LG1 - LG3 region of the lam - inin a 2 chain ( Carafoli et al . , 2009 ) . Manual rebuilding and reﬁnement were done using COOT ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) and PHENIX . The ﬁgures were generated using PyMOL ( www . pymol . org ) . Sequence Alignment For the analysis of surface conservation in Figure 3C , we aligned the lam - inin a 1 sequences of 14 vertebrate species using Clustal Omega ( Sievers et al . , 2011 ) : human ( UniProt : 25391 ) , mouse ( UniProt : P19137 ) , rat ( UniProt : D4A409 ) , sheep ( UniProt : W5NQ90 ) , cow ( UniProt : F1MEG3 ) , dog ( UniProt : F1PJ02 ) , cat ( UniProt : M3W9Z2 ) , panda ( UniProt : G1LM02 ) , rabbit ( UniProt : G1TTH9 ) , chick ( UniProt : F1NM47 ) , bat ( UniProt : G1P1G9 ) , zebraﬁsh ( UniProt : Q45H72 ) , Xenopus tropicalis ( UniProt : F7AVS9 ) , and Oreochromis niloticus ( UniProt : I3KD18 ) . Residues ﬂagged by a colon ( : ) in the alignment were considered to be strongly similar .
