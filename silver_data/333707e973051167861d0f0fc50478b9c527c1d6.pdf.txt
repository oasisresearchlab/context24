Taxol acts by hyper - stabilizing microtubules , inhibiting mitosis , and eventually causing cell apoptosis . The change in cytoskeleton dynamics likely influences the cell’s ability to apply force and change shape ; both are required for metastatic invasion . We have previously shown that the mechanobiological invasiveness of metastatic cells can be determined through their mechanical interactions with a synthetic polyacrylamide gel ; metastatic cells indent gels in attempted invasion , while benign cells do not . Objectives : In the current study , we reveal reduction due to Taxol treatment in the mechanobiological invasiveness of metastatic cancer cells , as measured by their ability to forcefully indent elastic gels . Methods : We evaluate the mechanical interaction of two human , metastatic breast cell lines , MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 468 , with a physiological - stiffness , synthetic , non - degradable and impenetrable polyacrylamide gel . We evaluate the effects of Taxol at concentrations of 5 - 25μM . Using an inverted , epifluorescence microscope we obtain images of the cells and the fluorescent particles embedded at the gel surface . When cells indent the gels , the particles at the indentation location ( beneath the cells ) are pushed to lower focal depths . The indentation depth is then calculated by the difference in focal depths for each individual cell within a group . Results : Treatment with Taxol rapidly ( < 2 hours ) reduces the number of indenting cells as well as the indentation depth . Specifically , the cells exhibit smaller indentations and lose their ability to synergistically and collectively apply force .

Anti - metastatic drugs may , for example , inhibit : vascularization , cell growth in different microenvironments , cell - extracellular matrix ( ECM ) binding , various receptor kinases , and cancer stem cells [ 1 , 2 ] . Thus , in clinical cases where metastases are likely , a combined , aggressive treatment targeting both tumor growth and metastasis formation is typically used . However , such aggressive treatments reduce the patients’ quality of life and increase their risk for kidney or liver - related toxicity [ 3 ] ; inappropriate treatment may even induce metastasis formation . Therefore , accurate assessment of the metastatic risk and subsequent identification of chemotherapeutics that may reduce metastasis formation are critically important . A key step in formation of metastases is the invasion of cancer cells through surrounding tissue , including cells and ECM . Most solid tumors exhibit collective migration during metastasis [ 4 ] , requiring synergistic interactions between the cells [ 5 ] . The molecular mechanisms of cancer invasion depend on cancer phenotype and the microenvironment [ 6 ] , yet typically include mechanobiological interactions [ 7 ] , i . e . for cell adherence and subsequent force application during migration and invasion . Accordingly using mechanobiology , we have shown that the invasiveness of cancer cells , indicative of the metastatic risk , can be rapidly ( < 2hrs ) identified through their mechanical interactions with an impenetrable gel [ 5 , 8 , 9 ] . Specifically , we have shown that following cell attachment , mechanically capable subpopulations of cancer cells indent an impenetrable gel in attempted invasion , while benign cells do not indent the gels [ 5 , 8 , 10 ] ; the metastatic cells indent the gels by utilizing elements of the cytoskeleton [ 10 ] to simultaneously applying lateral and normal forces to the gels [ 8 ] . We have determined that the number of indenting cancer cells and their attained depths correlate with their invasive capacity [ 5 , 8 ] . Furthermore , we have shown that the subpopulations of indenting cells correspond to those that are able to cross an 8  m Boyden chamber membrane [ 9 ] , thus correlating indentations and their depth with the invasiveness of the evaluated cells . Until recently anti - cancer and anti - metastatic treatments were chosen and adapted to a patient by trial and error [ 11 ] . Recently , new methods and techniques for personalized cancer treatment were developed , all of which have limitations , e . g . costs , Page 3 of 21 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - CSPO - 100062 . R2 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546 47 48495051525354555657585960 A c c e p t e d M a nu s c r i p t test - times , accuracy , and specificity . For example , drugs were introduced in vivo directly into the tumor , their effect was evaluated by resecting the sample , and the subsequent treatment protocol decided from those results [ 12 , 13 ] . As in vivo experiments are complex and dangerous , mathematical models have been used to determine personalized drug doses [ 14 ] and genetic testing has been used to identify patient - subsets that may benefit from a given therapeutic [ 15 , 16 ] . To further identify drugs appropriate for specific patient subsets , the response of a wide variety ( > 400 ) of human , cancer cell lines to over 130 anticancer agents was determined [ 17 , 18 ] , using DNA , RNA and chromosome - level characterization , as well as drug - sensitivity profiles . While the response of cell lines in in vitro culture to drugs do not accurately reflect the in vivo effects , they are beneficial for preliminary drug - screening [ 19 ] . An added value in a chemotherapy would be if it were able to reduce the metastatic capacity of cells . A commonly used treatment to inhibit growth of various solid cancers ( ovarian , breast , pancreatic , etc . ) is the chemotherapy drug Paclitaxel ( Taxol ) [ 20 , 21 ] . Paclitaxel has a relatively high ( up to 76 % ) response rate in patients [ 22 ] , however has also been shown , in some cases , to have a dose dependent pro - metastatic effects [ 23 , 24 ] . Therefore , it is extremely important to determine appropriate doses through their effect on metastatic capacity of cancer cells . The effect of Paclitaxel is through hyper - stabilization of the microtubules ( MTs ) , whereby eliminating the MT dynamics , mitosis is inhibited [ 25 ] . In the context of metastasis , MTs also have important roles in cell motility and division , organelle transport , and in cell morphogenesis and organization . We have previously shown that intracellular motion is actively driven by fluctuating microtubules , and internal dynamics is directly affected by Taxol treatment [ 26 ] . In addition to the hyper - stabilization of microtubules , The enhanced polymerization and re - localization of F - actin in Taxol - treated cells was also demonstrated [ 23 , 26 ] , which has led to reduced adhesive forces applied by cancer cells on gels [ 27 ] . In the current work , we show that using the gel - assay we can determine the efficacy of varying concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drug Paclitaxel in reducing the mechanobiological invasiveness of the evaluated metastatic breast cells . We seed high and low metastatic potential cells on the gels and show a Taxol - concentration dependent reduction in the number of indenting cells and the attained depths . Both the single cells and cells in close proximity ( i . e . densely seeded ) exhibit reduced indentation depths , yet the effect is more significant when cells are closely situated .

In addition , we show a difference in the response of the high and low metastatic potential cells , relating to their relative invasiveness . Materials and Methods Cell culture . We have used two commercially - available human , epithelial breast cell lines : high MP ( MDA - MB - 231 , ATCC , Manassas , VA ) , low MP ( MDA - MB - 468 , ATCC , Manassas , VA ) both breast cancer cells collected from lung metastases . The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) supplemented with 10 % vol . fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % vol . each of L - glutamine , penicillin - streptomycin and sodium pyruvate ( all from Biological Industries , Kibbutz Beit Haemek , Israel ) [ 5 , 8 , 9 , 28 – 30 ] . Polyacrylamide hydrogel preparation . Polyacrylamide ( PAM ) gels were prepared with Young’s modulus 2 . 4 kPa ( stiffness of physiological soft tissue [ 31 ] ) according to an established protocol [ 8 , 28 ] . Acrylamide ( 34 µl of 40 % vol ) and BIS acrylamide monomers ( 3 . 8 µl of 2 % vol . ) were combined ( both Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , within 203µl of distilled water . Gelation was initiated with ammonium persulfate ( APS ) and catalyzed with the tertiary aliphatic amine N , N , N’ , N’ - tetramethylethylenediamine ( TEMED , both Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . Red fluorescent ( excitation / emission 580 / 605 nm ) carboxylated polystyrene particles ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , 200 nm in diameter , were embedded at the gel ' s surface by performing slow gelation at 2 o C during centrifugation . Finally , the surface of the gel was shortly activated with Sulfo - SANPAH ( Pierce , Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) , washed with HEPES , and coated with rat tail collagen type I ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) to facilitate cell adhesion [ 6 - 8 , 25 – 27 ] . The Young’s modulus , E , of the gels was obtained by the following relation : E = 2 G * ( 1 +  ) [ 8 , 29 ] , where the Poisson’s ratio ,  , is 0 . 49 for PAM gels [ 32 ] . The G * was measured using a TA Instruments AR - G2 rheometer ( New Castle , DE ) with a 2 - cm stainless steel parallel plate fixture . Using dynamic measurements we determine that the loss ( G " ) modulus is 1 - 2 of magnitude less than storage modulus ( G ' ) . Therefore the Page 5 of 21 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - CSPO - 100062 . R2 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546 47 48495051525354555657585960 A c c e p t e d M a nu s c r i p t complex modulus , G * ≈ G ' , as expected for an elastic material [ 33 ] . The gel recipe yielded a gel with 2 . 44±0 . 04 kPa , with high reproducibility between batches [ 8 , 27 ] . Polyacrylamide gels have previously been shown ( by comparing rheology and AFM measurements ) to be spatially homogeneous and to possess remarkably linear mechanical properties [ 34 ] . Sample preparation . We have seeded 300 , 000 cells per gel , resulting in an average of 19 ± 5 cells per field - of - view ( area of 0 . 016 mm 2 ) . The cells were closely situated or adjacent on the gel ( some touching ) , yet typically remain in a 2 - diemsnional layer on the gel . Samples ( including cells and gels ) were immersed in 1ml growth media reaching 1 cm above the gel height . The cells were allowed 40 - 55 minutes to attach the gels and then drug treatment and / or imaging was performed . Conditions of 37ºC , 5 % CO 2 , and high humidity ( 90 % ) were maintained throughout the experiment , using an on - stage and on - microscope incubator ( Life Imaging Services , Switzerland ) , to maintain cell viability for prolonged periods of time . Drug treatment . A stock solution of 0 . 01M Paclitaxel ( Taxol ) ( Cytoskeleton Ltd . , Denver , CO ) in Dimethyl Sulphoxide ( DMSO , Sigma , St Louis , MO ) was diluted with cell - growth media to a final concentration of 5 , 10 or 25 μM , and was added to the cells attached to the gels . The cells were incubated with the drug for 1 - 2 hours before imaging . At least three independent experiments were performed with each Taxol concentration ( including control with no Taxol ) for each of the two cell lines , resulting in statistically significant numbers of indenting cells ( see Table S1 ) . Viability and nucleus staining . Viability of cells was determined by Calcein - AM fluorometric assay ( BioVision , Milpitas , CA ) [ 35 ] , where the compound easily penetrates the intact membranes of live cells . Hydrolysis of Calcein - AM by intracellular esterases produces fluorescence in the cell cytoplasm which can be observed at excitation / emission of 485 / 530 nm starting at 30 min after staining . Cell nuclei were live - stained using Hoechst 33342 ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) [ 36 ] , which fluorescently labels the nuclei ( excitation / emission 346 / 460 nm ) after 1 - 2 hours of incubation . Microscopy and imaging . The imaging for cell indentations was done using an on - stage and on - microscope incubators with an inverted , epifluorescence Olympus IX81 microscope ( Olympus Japan ) , using a 60× / 0 . 7NA differential interference contrast Page 6 of 21 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - CSPO - 100062 .

Images were captured using a XR Mega - 10AWCL camera ( Stanford Photonics Inc . , Palo Alto , CA ) with a final magnification of 107 . 8 nm / pixel [ 8 , 9 ] . In each sample , at least 28 different randomly chosen fields of view ( FOV ) were imaged . We collected images of the cells , stains and the particles embedded at the gel surface , and at different depths where particles were in focus ( Figure 1 ) . Specifically , at each FOV we obtained a DIC image of the cells on the gel , fluorescence images of the calcein ( viability ) and Hoechst ( nucleus ) stains , a fluorescence image of the particles at the gel surface focal plane , and a series of fluorescence images of the particles at 4 - 6 focal depths below the gel height , where 1 - 8 indenting cells were in focus at each depth ( Figure 1 ) . The indentation depth was then calculated by the difference in focal depths between the fluorescence image at the gel surface ( undisturbed gel ) and at the lowest focal plane where particles are in focus , i . e . at the bottom of the specific indenting cell [ 5 ] . Images were analyzed using a custom - designed module in MATLAB 2012b ( The MathWorks , Nattick , MA ) to determine the number of viable and indenting cells , as well as the indentation depth of each cell . We determined the number of indenting cells out of the total viable cells . Statistical analysis . The cells with high or low metastatic potential at the same condition were compared , as were the cells of the same MP but under different conditions . The general , linear mixed model , which is a multivariate regression method that helps to generalize the analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was used [ 37 ] . In all cases , statistical significance was determined when the p - value is less than 0 . 05 . Results We have seeded high and low MP breast cancer cells on 2 . 4kPa PAM gels , allowed attachment for 40 - 55 minutes , and evaluated changes in their mechanical interactions following 1 - 2 hours treatment with Taxol . Cells were seeded in amounts that resulted in many groups of adjacent yet non - overlapping cells in each field of view [ 5 ] ; while cells were in close proximity and some were in contact they remained in a 2 - dimensional layer on the gel surface . A subpopulation of the metastatic cells indented the gels before drug treatment . The percentage of untreated ( 0µM Taxol ) indenting , closely situated high and low MP cells was 61±10 % and 38 . 8±8 . 9 % , respectively , matching our previously published work [ 5 ] ; untreated single , well - spaced cells indent Page 7 of 21 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - CSPO - 100062 . R2 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546 47 48495051525354555657585960 A c c e p t e d M a nu s c r i p t in smaller amounts , respectively , 49±8 % and 33±5 % [ 9 ] . Cell morphology was unaffected by the Taxol treatment and the cells remained rounded ( Figure S1 ) , in contrast to the same cell lines on a rigid , glass surface , which become rounded with protrusions on their surface [ 26 ] . We have evaluated the change in cell viability , the number of indenting cells and their depths , following treatment with 5 , 10 and 25µM Taxol as compared to untreated control ( Figure 2 and Table S1 ) . Viability of the high MP ( MDA - MB - 231 ) and the low MP ( MDA - MB - 468 ) breast cancer cells was affected by higher concentrations of the Taxol . Both cell types were not significantly affected by , respectively , ≤5µM and ≤10µM Taxol treatment ( Figure 2A and Table S2 ) . At the highest tested concentration of 25  M Taxol the viability decreased significantly for both cell lines , yet the low MP cells were more affected ; these cells were shown to undergo programmed cell death by Taxol treatment [ 38 ] . This may relate to weaker cell adhesion after 2 hours on the soft , elastic gels , as we have previously shown these cells’ viability is uninfluenced by 25µM Taxol when they have been adhered on glass for 24h [ 26 ] . The subpopulation of adhered and viable cells that indent the gels are the focus of the current study . We observe that the percentage of indenting cells of both types reduces linearly with increasing Taxol concentration ( Figure 2B ) ; the difference is statistically significant between most concentrations ( Table S3 ) . The reduction is steeper in the high MP cells , yet more high MP cells indent the gels than the low MP cells , at all Taxol concentrations ( Table S3 ) . Interestingly , we note that following 25  M Taxol treatment , the percentage of indenting high MP cells reduces to a similar amount as the control , untreated low MP cells . The reduced amounts of indenting cells also decrease their attained indentation depths following Taxol treatment ( Figure 3 ) . As we have previously shown [ 5 ] , the baseline indentation depth of the untreated , breast cancer cells in close proximity is a two - peak distribution , varying between 2 - 20 µm with the minima at 10µm ( Figure S2 ) . The minima depth of 10 µm is , interestingly , also the maximal indentation depth exhibited by single , well - spaced cells [ 5 , 8 , 9 ] . We observe that Taxol treatment significantly reduced and even eliminated the number of cells that indent the gels > 10 µm ( Figure 4 ) ; the depth distributions become similar to those of single cells as observed e . g . in well - spaced , single high MP cells under 25  M of Taxol ( Figure S3 ) . The high MP cells are more rapidly affected , reaching a plateau response at > 10 µm Page 8 of 21 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - CSPO - 100062 . R2 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546 47 48495051525354555657585960 A c c e p t e d M a nu s c r i p t Taxol , yet the means of the depths < 10 µm are unchanged . In contrast , in the low MP cells , where less cells indented to deep depths to begin with , the effect of the treatment was milder . Discussion The morphologies of the cells during gel indentation correlate with those previously observed during cancer cell invasion in vitro and in vivo ; here and also previously we have observed rounded cell morphologies on the soft gels , which appear mushroom - like in 3D [ 8 , 10 ] . Various stages and types of cancer cell invasion initialize with the cells changing shape and applying mechanical forces to their surroundings . Specifically , during the initial steps of in vivo cancer cell invasion into the stroma , penetration through the ECM and endothelial transmigration ( intravasation / extravasation ) invading cells must change morphology according to the locally encountered microenvironment ; cells squeeze through small pores by narrowing their leading edge and / or by applying force . Specifically , leading cells ( i . e . tip cells ) typically exhibit pseudopods and similar protrusions , observed during invasion both in vitro and in vivo [ 39 – 42 ] . Hence , the morphology of invading cells that develops during their mechanical interactions with the gel substrate ( quantified through the indentation depth ) can provide a measure for the cells’ invasive capacity . We have observed a reduction in percentage of indenting cells and in the attained indentation depths – their mechanobiological invasiveness , which correlates with the cells migratory and invasive capabilities [ 9 ] . Similar effects of comparable concentration Taxol treatments on cancer cells have previously been observed , yet on longer time scales . The number of migrating low MP breast cancer cells ( MDA - MB - 468 ) treated with 3 . 12µM Taxol was dramatically reduced , as measured by a gap - closure assay [ 43 ] . The invasive capacity of the cells through narrow barriers was also reduced under 16  M Taxol [ 44 ] , likely since the cells were unable to dynamically modify their cytoskeletons [ 10 , 26 ] . Correspondingly , adhesion was also affected , as MDA - MB - 231 cells trypsinized for 35 min resisted detachment , following 24h Taxol treatment [ 15 ] . In contrast , short time - scale Taxol treatment ( 0 . 5 - 1 . 0µM for 1h ) of prostate tumor cells ( PC3 ) was enough to completely inhibit attachment and block migration through a Boyden chamber [ 45 ] . Thus , Taxol effects in vitro depends on Page 9 of 21 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - CSPO - 100062 . R2 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546 47 48495051525354555657585960 A c c e p t e d M a nu s c r i p t Taxol concentration and treatment time , as well as on ( cancer ) cell type and the metastatic potential . We observe higher baseline mechanobiological invasiveness in the high MP breast cancer cells , yet also a larger reduction following Taxol treatment ; the high MP cells still always remain more invasive than the low MP cells . We have previously shown that the microtubule network is sparser in the high MP cell lines when on glass [ 26 , 46 ] , which is likely why their response to the microtubule - targeting drug is stronger . We have observed that during indentation , both cell types exhibit cell - wide dispersion of the microtubules at times concentrated at the leading edge , where the actin is localized [ 10 ] . The microtubule structure and dynamics in both cell types is affected by Taxol treatment [ 26 ] , where the dynamics are reduced . This directly affects the cells’ ability to dynamic modify their internal structure and actively apply force to the gels . We observe that under Taxol concentrations of 5 - 10  M applied up to 5 hours the in vitro mechanobiological invasiveness is reduced while the cell viability is not significantly affected . Mechanobiological changes following microtubule disruptions have previously been shown to be on short timescales , up to 1 hour [ 47 , 48 ] , enabling rapid , survival - driven responses . In contrast , growth inhibition is typically on longer timescales than evaluated here ; growth inhibition is assessed on timescales comparable to the doubling time of cells . In vivo , Taxol exposure is also on longer timescales and concentrations are typically lower . The IC50 , concentration at which 50 % of cell growth inhibited of the two evaluated breast - cancer cell lines has been determined as 1 - 100 nM in different studies [ 49 – 51 ] , being highly dependent on the exposure time , typically 24 - 48 hours . Interestingly , high concentrations of Taxol ( on the order of 10  M ) did not inhibit cell growth more than lower concentrations [ 49 ] and in fact increased cell survival [ 51 ] . Similarly , low Taxol concentrations applied for long times ( 20nM for 24 hours ) have also shown a reduction in adherence forces of the high MP cells ( MDA - MB - 231 ) . Specifically , the lateral , 2 - dimensional traction forces ( in plane with the gel surface ) reduced to 1 / 3 of the untreated control [ 27 ] ; traction forces of cells adhered for 10 hours [ 27 ] are larger than applied by the same cells during adherence ( 1 - 6 hours ) [ 29 ] . The mechanobiological response combined with changes in viability also control the effects in vivo and the overall effectiveness of the drug ; cell damage and death following chemotherapy directly affect the function of neighboring cells . Products of injured and dead cells in the tumor environment induce activation of the toll - like Page 10 of 21 AUTHOR SUBMITTED MANUSCRIPT - CSPO - 100062 . R2 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546 47 48495051525354555657585960 A c c e p t e d M a nu s c r i p t receptor - 4 ( TLR4 ) in viable cancer cells , which has been correlated to mechanisms for Paclitaxel chemoresistance [ 24 ] . Concurrently , pro - tumorigenic effects have been induced by chemotherapy damaged tumor cells [ 52 ] by contributory host effects [ 53 ] . In cells that undergo apoptosis due to chemotherapy , caspase - 3 is activated causing upregulation of prostaglandin synthesis and release of growth - promoting factors , which promote tumor - site repopulation by the surviving tumor cells [ 52 , 54 ] . Thus , for in vivo applications , the optimal drug concentration is one that will reduce the cell invasiveness while not reducing their viability . Conclusion In conclusion , we have shown that the mechanobiological invasiveness of the evaluated high and low MP breast cancer cells reduces following Taxol treatment , while the viability is nearly unaffected . That is , the ability of the cells to indent the cells is reduced and synergistic interactions between the adjacent cells is lost , albeit the viable high MP cells are still able to indent more than the low MP cells at all evaluated Taxol concentrations ; evaluation of more cell lines would be required to determine the generality of this phenomenon . Hence , using our previous correlation of the indentation depth with invasiveness of the cells [ 9 ] , we conclude that the Taxol reduces the invasiveness of the cell lines evaluated in the current study . Thus , the gel - deformations ( e . g . indentation ) that are induced by cell - applied forces can reveal the reduction in cell invasiveness due to chemotherapy . Using our mechanobiology approach , we have identified specific drug concentrations where cell viability is maintained while the mechanobiological invasiveness of the cells on physiological stiffness gels is reduced . Current drug - screening assays ( typically with the cell viability as the only parameter to determine the drug - response ) are mostly performed on rigid tissue culture plates . However , physiological stiffness is likely more appropriate , affecting design of predictive biomaterial - based in vitro assays for drug screening [ 55 ] . Using our tunable stiffness gels [ 8 , 29 ] and evaluating cell viability concurrently with mechanobiological invasiveness may provide an approach to determine the optimal drug concentrations and dosages in a cell line specific or patient - personalized approach .
