Rodrigues 1 , Sergey Lekomtsev 1 , Silvana Jananji 2 , Janos Kriston - Vizi 1 , Gilles R . X . Hickson 2 , 3 & Buzz Baum 1 , 4 , 5 Cell division requires the precise coordination of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis . This coordination is achieved by the recruitment of an actomyosin regulator , Ect2 , to overlapping microtubules at the centre of the elongating anaphase spindle 1 . Ect2 then signals to the overlying cortex to promote the assembly and constriction of an actomyosin ring between segregating chromosomes 1 . Here , by studying division in proliferating Drosophila and human cells , we demonstrate the existence of a second , parallel signalling pathway , which triggers the relaxation of the polar cell cortex at mid anaphase . This is independent of furrow formation , centrosomes and microtubules and , instead , depends on PP1 phosphatase and its regulatory subunit Sds22 ( refs 2 , 3 ) . As separating chromosomes move towards the polar cortex at mid anaphase , kinetochore - localized PP1 – Sds22 helps to break cortical symmetry by inducing the dephosphorylation and inactivation of ezrin / radixin / moesin proteins at cell poles . This pro - moteslocalsofteningofthecortex 2 , 3 , facilitatinganaphaseelongation and orderly cell division . In summary , this identifies a conserved kinetochore - based phosphatase signal and substrate , which function together to link anaphase chromosome movements to cortical polar - ization , thereby coupling chromosome segregation to cell division . As animal cells exit mitosis they assemble a cleavage furrow at their equator , whose position is determined by the overlapping micro - tubules of the central spindle 1 .

Recently , however , it has become clear that proliferating animal cells assemble a rigid and iso - tropic actomyosin cortex as they enter mitosis 4 , which , if not disas - sembled , might interfere with furrow formation . To test this idea , and to determine whether relaxation of the cortex at opposing cell poles contributes to cell division 5 , we analysed sensory organ precursor ( SOP ) cells in the Drosophila pupal notum , where live - cell imaging can be used to study the changes in cell shape that accompany mitotic progression in the context of a developing epithelium 6 , 7 . In these cells , actin was cleared from cell poles before any overt signs of equatorial constriction werevisible ( Fig . 1a , b ) , aspreviouslyproposed 8 . Similarly , polarrelaxation wasfoundtoprecedefurrowformationinhumancells ( Fig . 1c ) . Moreover , in both systems , polar relaxation , as evidenced by actin clearance , cell elongation and / or blebbing , was seen following silencing of the centralspindlin component RacGAP1 ( also called MgcRacGAP in humans and Tumbleweed in Drosophila ) ( Fig . 1d and Extended Data Figs 1a , d and 2a , b ) , although this led to profound defects in the equatorial recruitment of actin and myosin II , furrow formation and cytokinesis ( Extended Data Figs 1a – c , e and 2c , d ) ( following RacGAP1 / Tumbleweed depletion , 100 % of human cells failed to divide 9 , 10 as did 30 % of Drosophila cells ) . In addition , actin ( Extended Data Fig . 2e – g ) and phospho - T559 - moesin ( p - moesin ) ( Extended Data Fig . 2h ) disappeared from the polar cortex before their accumulation at the furrow . Together , these data suggest the existence of a conserved second signal that functions independently of the well - studied spindle midzone to polarize the anaphase cortex . To identify the source of the signal , we began by considering the possibility that it is associated with centrosomes and astral microtu - bules , which have previously been proposed to regulate cortical con - tractilityatthecellequator 11 , 12 and atcellpoles 13 , 14 . Weeliminatedboth through mutation of the gene asterless ( ref . 15 ) ( Extended Data Fig . 3a – c ) . This led to randomization of the orientation of the spindle ( Extended Data Fig . 3d ) without compromising mitotic progression , asexpected followinga loss of crosstalk between themetaphase spindle and cortex . Nevertheless , in anaphase , both F - actin ( Fig . 1e , f and Extended Data Fig . 3e ) and p - moesin ( Fig . 1g , h ) were cleared from opposing cell poles as efficiently as they were in control cells . As an alternative approach to address the same question , we used a cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor ( RO3306 ) to force cultured cells arrested in prometaphase to leave mitosis with a monopolar spindle . This induces monopolar cytokinesis 16 . As cortical symmetry was broken , phosphorylated ezrin / radixin / moesin ( p - ERM ) was lost from the cortex on the side of the cell furthest from centrosomes and the bulk of midzone microtubules ( Extended Data Fig . 3f ) . Similar results were observed in cells forced to exit mitosis in the presence of high doses of microtubule inhibitors following either CDK inhibition ( ExtendedDataFig . 3g – i , k ) orMad2depletion ( ExtendedDataFig . 3g , h , j , k ) . These data show that the cortical polarization induced by mitotic exit is independent of both centrosomes and astral microtubules . Notably , however , actin filaments and p - ERM proteins were always lost from portions of the cortex closest to anaphase chromatin in these ex - periments ( Extended Data Fig . 3f – k ) . This observation suggests a rolefor anaphase chromatin in the establishment of cortical polarity . To assess the timing of this chromosomally associated signal , we repeated the analysis in cells forced to flatten through the expression of an activated version of the Rap1 GTPase ( Rap1 * ) 17 . Although this pushed metaphase chromosomes close to the cell cortex , forced mitotic exit ( through CDK inhibition ) still triggered a sudden loss of F - actin and cortical relaxation close to chromatin ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) . Thus , the chromatin - associated signal appears enhanced at the onset of anaphase . To see whether segregating chromosomes perform a similar func - tion during a normalmitoticexit ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Video 1 ) , we used kymographs of dividing SOP cells ( Fig . 2b ) to monitor the relative timing of anaphase cell elongation ( D1 ) , the distance of the chromatin ( kinetochore interface ) to the cell centre ( D2 ) , and the approach of chromosomes to the poles ( D3 ) ( Fig . 2c and Extended Data Fig . 4c , d ) . Under these physiological conditions the approach of the chromatin mass to cell poles was associated with loss of cortical actin ( Fig . 2d , e ) , which translated into a simple , near - linear relation - ship between the distance of kinetochores from the cell pole and cor - ticalactinclearance ( Fig . 2f – h ) . Furthermore , inSOPcells , corticalactin was lost from the anterior pole , where chromatin approaches first , before being lost from the posterior pole ( Extended Data Fig . 4f – i ) . Taken together , these data support the existence of a chromosomally derived signal that induces polar relaxation following mitotic exit . PP1 - 87B phosphatase and its regulatory subunit Sds22 ( also called PPP1R7 in humans ) seemed good candidates for molecular regulators of this process as previous work showed that they negatively regulate p - moesin during mitotic exit 2 , 3 . As previously reported 2 , RNA inter - ference ( RNAi ) - mediated silencing of either PP1 - 87B or Sds22 led to a failure in clearance of the polar cortex at anaphase ( Fig . 3a , b and Supplementary Videos 2 , 3 ) . This was accompanied by a defect in cell elongation ( Extended Data Fig . 5c – h ) , enabling anaphase chro - mosomes to come much closer to the cortex of PP1 - 87B or Sds22 RNAi cells than they did in the control ( Extended Data Fig . 5a , b ; a similar phenotype was observed in cultured cells depleted for Sds22 D1 Cell centre a d e F - actin DNA b Early Mid Late anaphase 0 60 100 140 170 Time after anaphase onset ( s ) 230 30 s Anterior pole R e l a t i v e ac t i n l e v e l s a t p o l e ( n = 12 ce ll s ) 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 1 . 25 Actin clearance28 % P < 0 . 001 Elongation onset = 1 Met c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 c8 d2d3d4d5d6d7 d8 d9 d1 f 5 c1c2c3c4c5c6c7c8c9 0 – 10 – 20 – 30 – 40 – 50 – 60 – 70 – 80 Time to pole expansion ( s ) 4 . 0 3 . 5 3 . 0 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 Actin levels vs time ( average ) d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9 4 . 5 4 . 0 3 . 5 3 . 0 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 Distance vs time ( average ) c1c2c3c4c5c6c7c8c9 4 . 0 3 . 0 2 . 0 1 . 0 Distance vs time ( cell B ) D i s t a n ce D N A – c o r t e x ( μ m ) 5 . 0 6 . 0 d1d2d3d4d5d6 d7 d8d9 Actin levels vs time ( cell B ) D i s t a n ce D N A – c o r t e x ( μ m ) 10 cells 10 cells Time to pole expansion ( s ) Time to pole expansion Time to pole expansion ( s ) g h A c t i n l e v e l s ( a . u . ) DNA – cortex ( μ m ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 r 2 = 0 . 83 n = 12 cells C e ll ce n t r e - t o - c o r t e x ( μ m ) – 40 – 20 0 20 40 Time ( s ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 3 7 4 6 5 D1 D3 D N A - t o - c o r t e x ( μ m ) 100 s 100 s 140 s 140 s 0 s0 s P A Cell A c Elongation onset A c t i n l e v e l s ( a . u . ) c1 c9 0 – 10 – 20 – 30 – 40 – 50 – 60 – 70 – 80 0 – 10 – 20 – 30 – 40 – 50 – 60 – 70 – 80 Before After D3 Figure 2 | Polar relaxation is triggered by chromatin proximity in mid anaphase . a , b , Images and the corresponding kymograph for an SOP cell undergoing anaphase ( representative of 12 biological replicates ) .

All rights reserved ( Extended Data Fig . 6b , c ) ) . These defects were recapitulated by the expression of a constitutively active , phospho - mimetic form of moesin ( Extended Data Fig . 7a – f ) , indicating that p - moesin is a key target of the phosphatase holo - enzyme . Moreover , PP1 - 87B complexes immunoprecipitated from fly cells efficiently dephosphorylated acti - vated moesin in a manner that depended in part on Sds22 ( Extended Data Fig . 7g , h ) . The block in polar relaxation induced by PP1 – Sds22 silencingortheexpressionofconstitutivelyactivemoesinledtoa near - identical series of extreme contortions as cells entered telophase ( Extended Data Fig . 8a – d and Supplementary Videos 4 – 7 ) . However , cells nearly always completed a successful cytokinesis . This we attribute to the parallel recruitment of myosin II to the mid - zone , which is robust and functionally independent of PP1 – Sds22 ( ref . 18 ) ( Extended Data Fig . 9a – c ) . To determine the likely localization of the relevant PP1 – Sds22 sig - nal , we used an Sds22 – green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fusion to study the dynamic localization of PP1 – Sds22 during mitotic progression . Several PP1 complexes are found at kinetochores , where they counter - actAuroraB activity and silence the mitotic checkpoint 19 – 21 . Some , like Repo - Man – PP1 , have been reported to move from the centromeres to chromosome arms at the metaphase – anaphase transition 22 . However , Sds22 – GFP was found concentrated at kinetochores ( Extended Data Fig . 10a ) during both metaphase and anaphase ( Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 10a – c ) . Moreover , the approach of kinetochore - bound Sds22 – GFP to the cortex in mid anaphase was associated with local blebbing ( Fig . 4a , b and Extended Data Fig . 10b , c ) . To determine whether this mid - anaphase polar relaxation depends on the observed accumulation of PP1 – Sds22 at kinetochores , we followed chro - mosome segregation in KNL1 RNAi cells , in which the kinetochore recruitment of PP1 – Sds22 is compromised 23 . The resulting drop in kinetochore localization of Sds22 ( as measured by Sds22 – GFP , Fig . 4a and Extended Data Fig . 10d , e ) was associated with the loss of polar blebbing and with reduced anaphase cell elongation ( Fig . 4b , c ) . Finally , to test whether a spatially defined PP1 phosphatase signal is sufficient to trigger local relaxation of the cortex , as predicted by this model , we used optogenetics 24 to artificially target the subunit Sds22 to the plasma membrane in cells arrested in mitosis . By fusing crypto - chrome 2 ( CRY2 ) to Sds22 ( CRY2 – mCherry – Sds22 ) , we were able to use light to drive the phosphatase to the membrane in cells co - expressing membrane - tethered CIBN 24 ( a truncated version of the Arabidopsis cryptochrome - interacting basic helix - loop - helix protein ) ( see Methods andExtended Data Fig . 10f ) . Inapproximatelyhalfofthe cells analysed , the local recruitment of Sds22 – mCherry was associated with bleb formation ( Fig . 4d ) . Thus , PP1 – Sds22 is both required for anaphase cortical relaxationand is sufficient to drivethisprocess when mislocalized to the cortex during metaphase . 0 s 60 s 120 s 150 s 0 s 60 s 120 s 140 s a 0 10 20 30 40 50 E l o n g a t i o n p r e - f u rr o w i n g ( % ) E l o n g a t i o n p r e - f u rr o w i n g ( % ) S d s 22 – G F P S d s 22 – G F P K N L1 R N A i P < 0 . 001 n = 13 ce ll s n = 14 ce ll s Sds22 – GFP Sds22 – GFP KNL1 RNAi b 0 % c d e Polar relaxation PP1 – Sds22 Myosin II Active moesin / F - actin Inactive moesin 1 2 3 RanGTP signal C R Y 2 – m C h e rr y – S d s 22 C R Y 2 – m C h e rr y Cells with induced blebbing ( % ) 0 s 8 s 13 s 18 s 51 % ( n = 39 cells ) Region illuminated with blue light 8 s 13 s 18 s 0 % ( n = 31 cells ) 0 s 0 s 8 s 13 s 18 s 2 % ( n = 25 cells ) C R Y 2 – m C h e rr y S d s 22 – G F P Metaphase Anaphase S d s 22 – G F P S d s 22 – G F P K N L1 R N A i 0 s 150 s Polar blebbing 75 % ( 20 cells ) * * 0 s 140 s No polar blebbing 86 % ( 14 cells ) * * Figure 4 | Local recruitment of Sds22 induces cortical relaxation . a – c , Cortical relaxation in Sds22 – GFP - expressing fly cells in control and KNL1 - depleted backgrounds . a , Representative images , together with b , their outlines over time , and c , graph of cell elongation showing mean and s . d .

All rights reserved In summary , although work over many decades has focused on crosstalk between the central spindle and the overlying actomyosin cortex in positioning the cleavage furrow 1 , 9 , 18 , this study reveals an additional , conserved kinetochore - based PP1 – Sds22 signal that helps to couple chromosome segregation to anaphase cell elongation . Both signals are likely to act in parallel to generate the gradient in cortical actomyosin contractility required for cytokinesis 25 ( Fig . 4e ) . The local - ization of PP1 – Sds22 to kinetochores is striking , as related PP1 phos - phatase complexes act at the same site to help control the decision to exit mitosis and to ensure the stable attachment of chromosomes to kinetochore microtubules 19 – 21 . As is the case for the PP1 - mediated stabilization of microtubule – kinetochore attachments 20 , the ability of kinetochore - localized PP1 – Sds22 to act on the cortex is likely to depend on the phosphatase complex counteracting the activity of Aurora kinases . Unlike other phosphatase subunits 22 , however , Sds22 – GFP remains on kinetochores throughout anaphase . This places the PP1 – Sds22 phosphatase complex in a perfect position to mediate communication between segregating chromosomes and the anaphase cortex , at least , in part , through the local dephosphorylation of ERM proteins at cell poles . Although recent studies have suggested a similar role for chromatin - bound Ran – GTP in cortical polarization duringboth meiotic andmitoticdivisions 26 , 27 ( Fig . 4e ) , themechanistic link between Ran and the actomyosin cortex is not clear . Moreover , a function for Ran in this process is hard to reconcile with the enhance - ment of the polar relaxation signal seen following mitotic exit ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) . Therefore more work is required to deter - mine how Ran , PP1 – Sds22 and other signals emanating from the anaphase spindle function together to break cortical symmetry at mitotic exit , and how this initial difference between cortical contract - ility at cell poles and the midzone is amplified to drive furrow forma - tion and cytokinesis , during both symmetric and asymmetric animal cell divisions .

All rights reserved METHODS Drosophila strains and husbandry . The following fly transgenes / alleles were used : neur - RFP ( from Y . Bellaiche ) , UAS - LifeAct : : GFP ( from F . Schnorrer ) , pnr - GAL4 ( BL3039 ) , EM462 - GAL4 ( from G . Morata ) , tub - GAL80 ts ( BL7018 and BL7108 ) , neur - GMA ( GFP fused to the F - actin - binding domain of the fly moesin 28 , expressed under the neuralized promoter ) , Sqh : : mCherry ( from E . Wieschaus ) , ubi - RFP : : Centrosomin ( from J . Raff ) , Asl mecD ( from J . Raff ) , gSpc25 : : mRFP ( from C . Lehner ) , UAS - Sds22 : : GFP ( from B . Thompson ) and UAS - Moesin : : GFP and UAS - MoesinT559D : : GFP ( from F . Payre ) . RNA interfer - ence ( RNAi ) lines were used to silence the expression of the following genes : RacGAP1 / tumbleweed ( DRSC , HMS01417 ) , Sds22 ( VDRC , TID42051 ) , PP1 - 87B ( VDRC , TID35024 ) and KNL1 / Spc105R ( DRSC , HMS01752 ) . To drive RNAi expression , we first generated a fly strain encoding neur - RFP ( which labels the chromatin of sensory organ cells at allstages of the cell cycle ) , pnr - GAL4 ( pannier is expressed in the central region of the notum 29 ) and UAS - LifeAct : : GFP ( to visualize actin filaments ) . Females of this line were then crossed to UAS - hairpin RNAimales . Toovercomethelethalityassociatedwithexpressionofthe inducible hairpin targeting either PP1 - 87B or RacGAP1 , we used a GAL80 temperature - sensitive background 30 . All flies were grown at 18 u C and shifted to 29 u C ( to inactivate GAL80 ts allowing GAL4 - dependent gene transcription ) at the begin - ning of pupariation . Expression of theinducible hairpin targeting KNL1 / Spc105R was accomplished using the EM462 - GAL4 driver . Cell lines . Well - established cell lines were used , all of which have been used in previously published studies from the Baum and Hickson laboratories and their collaborators . Human cell lines were subjected to frequent mycoplasma tests and tested negative relative to a positive control . Plasmids for expression in human cells . To create CRY2 – mCherry – Sds22 , the Sds22 coding sequence ( NM _ 002712 ) was inserted into CRY2 – mCherry by using sequence - and ligation - independent cloning as previously described 31 . Briefly , a CRY2 – mCherry vector was linearized by inverse PCR reaction . Sds22 was amp - lified by PCR with primers containing a 20 - bp extension homologous to each end of the linearized vector . Vector and insert were mixed and incubated with T4 polymerase , followed by transformation in TOP10 - competent cells ( Invitrogen ) . siRNA transfection . The following siRNA duplexes were used at a final concen - tration of 50nM : AllStars control ( Qiagen , 1027280 ) , RacGAP1 ( Invitrogen Stealth HSS120934 ) ( GCCAAGAACUGAGACAGACAGUGUG ) and Sds22 ( Qiagen Hs _ PPP1R7 _ 5 ) ( CCAGATCAAGAAGATTGAGAA ) . Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) was used for siRNA transfection . Cells were analysed 31h after transfection with siRNA . For the experiments of cell flattening ( in Fig . 3c , d , Extended Data Fig . 4a , b and Extended Data Fig . 6d ) , cells were trans - fected with Rap1 * before siRNA treatment , as previously described 17 . Live imaging of DrosophilaSOP cells . For time - lapse imaging , fly pupae were first attached to a slide with double - sided tape on their ventral side , as previously described 7 . A small window was then cut in the pupal case on the dorsal side to expose the notum . A coverslip , together with a drop of halocarbon oil , was then placedoverthewholefly , supportedbycoverslipsgluedontoeitherendoftheslide toallowimagingonconfocalmicroscopes . Time - lapsemovieswereacquiredusing a Leica SPE confocal microscope with a 40 3 lens ( NA 1 . 3 ) . Nota were imaged at 14 – 16h after puparium formation . In all cases , male and female flies were treated equivalently without randomization ; animal numbers used were determined by experimental constraints . DrosophilaS2 cell experiments . Schneider’s S2 cells ( from the O’Farrell labor - atory , University of California , San Francisco ) , grown in Schneider’s medium supplementedwith10 % fetalcalfserum ( LifeTechnologies ) , wereseededin8 - well Labtek chambered coverglass dishes ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and treated with 25 m M colchicine ( Sigma ) for 30 min before the start of imaging or fixation . Mitotic exit was induced by prior incubation for 48h with Mad2 double - stranded RNAs ( dsRNAs ) ( as previously described 32 ) or by 10 m M RO3306 for 5 – 10 min . Cellswerefixedusing4 % formaldehydeinPBSfor10minbeforepermeabilization and blocking with PBS containing 0 . 1 % triton X - 100 and 5 % normal goat serum ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Cells were immunostained using antibodies against p - ERM ( Cell Signaling , 3141S , 1 / 200 ) and anillin ( 1 / 1 , 000 , a gift from C . Field ) . DNA was stained using Hoechst 33258 ( 1 / 1 , 000 ) and F - actin was stained with Alexa546 - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . Live - cell imaging was per - formed using cells stably expressing Histone - H2B – GFP and anillin – mCherry constructs under the control of the constitutive act5C promoter . Imaging was performed at room temperature using an Ultraview Vox spinning disc confocal system ( PerkinElmer ) , employing a CSU - X1 scanning unit ( Yokogawa ) and an Orca - R2 charge - coupleddevicecamera ( Hamamatsu ) fitted toa LeicaDMI6000B inverted microscope equipped with a motorized piezo - electric stage ( Applied Scientific Instrumentation ) . Image acquisition was performed using Volocity 6 ( Improvision / Perkin Elmer ) and a Plan Apo 63 3 oil - immersion objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) with camera binning set to 2 3 2 . Live imaging of human cells . HEK293T cells ( gift from the Marsh laboratory , University College London ) were plated on glass - bottomed dishes ( MatTek ) . HeLa cells stably expressing LifeAct – GFP / Histone - H2B - mRFP ( as previously published 4 , 17 ) were plated on chambered coverslips ( Labtek ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) coated with 10 m g ml – 1 fibronectin ( Sigma ) . Before recording of live cells , the medium was changed to a phenol - red - free CO 2 - independent medium , L - 15 ( Leibovitz ) . ForFig . 1c , Fig . 3c , d , ExtendedDataFig . 4a , bandExtendedData Fig . 6 , frames were acquired at 37 u C using an UltraView Vox ( Perkin Elmer ) spinning disc confocal microscope with a 60 3 oil objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) and images acquired using a Hamamatsu C9100 - 13 EMCCD camera and Volocity software ( Perkin Elmer ) . Images in Fig . 1d and Extended Data Fig . 2b were acquired at37 u CusingaZeissAxioObserverZ1microscopecontrolledbyVolocity6 . 3soft - ware ( Perkin Elmer ) and equipped with an Orca 03GO1 camera ( Hamamatsu ) and a 40 3 oil DICII objective ( NA 1 . 3 ) . For the optogenetic experiments ( Fig . 4d ) , HEK293T cells were co - transfected with CIBN – GFP – CAAX , CRY2 – mCherry , CRY2 – mCherry – Sds22 and Sds22 – GFP ( plasmid from J . Swedlow ) using FuGENE HD ( Promega ) . By 22h after transfection , cells were treated with 50ngml – 1 nocodazolefor8handimagedafternocodazolewash - outusinga Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope and 60 3 oil objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) . Ten consecutive pulses ( 800 ms each ) of 488 - nm light at 15 % of laser output were used to induce interaction between CIBN and CRY2 . A 561 - nm laser was used to image CRY2 – mCherry or CRY2 – mCherry – Sds22 . Immunofluorescence microscopy in Drosophila . Nota from pupae 14 – 16h after puparium formation were dissected in PBS at room temperature . Tissues were promptly fixedin10 % trichloroaceticacid or4 % formaldehyde for 20minat room temperature , before being permeabilized in PBS containing 0 . 1 % triton X - 100 . Subsequently , nota were incubated in a blocking solution composed of 5 % bovine serum albumin ( Sigma ) and 3 % fetal bovine serum ( PAA ) ( in PBS ) . Once immunostained and mounted , tissues were imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope and 60 3 oil objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) . Immunofluorescence microscopy in human cells . For the data shown in Extended Data Fig . 3f , hTERT RPE - 1 cells ( used previously 4 ) were arrested in prometaphasebyusingtheEg5kinesininhibitorSTLC ( 5 m M , Sigma ) for8h . Cells were treated with a low dose of nocodazole ( 20nM , Sigma ) for 3h to specifically disrupt astral microtubules 33 . To induce monopolar cytokinesis , the CDK1 inhib - itor RO3306 ( 10 m M , Sigma ) was added to STLC - treated cells for 10min . Cells were then fixed on ice in 10 % trichloroacetic acid for 15 min before being pro - cessed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described 34 . Images in Extended Data Fig . 3f were acquired on a Leica SPE confocal microscope with a 63 3 lens ( NA 1 . 3 ) . Immunoprecipitation assays . For the data shown in Extended Data Fig . 7g , dsRNAs targeting LacZ and Sds22 were generated using T7 - tagged oligonucleo - tides and a T7 dsRNA kit ( Ambion ) as previously described 35 . S2 cells were transfected with dsRNA following transfection with PP1 - 87B – GFP on the next day . Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % triton X - 100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) 72h after dsRNA transfection . PP1 - 87B – GFP was collected with GFP – Trap - A ( Chromotek ) . For the substrate , S2 cells were transfected with Flag – moesin . By 48h after transfec - tion , cells were treated with 50nM calyculin A for 25 min and lysed in buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 ( Sigma ) . Flag – moesin was collected with anti - Flag M2 beads ( Sigma ) and eluted with buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7 . 5 , 30 mM NaCl and 150 ng m l – 1 3xFlag peptide . Eluted Flag – moesin was added to the beads boundtoPP1 - 87B – GFP , incubatedat30 u Cfortheindicatedtimeandanalysedby immunoblotting . Antibodies and dyes . The following antibodies and dyes were used for immuno - fluorescence microscopy : rabbit anti - p - ERM ( Cell Signaling , 3141S , 1 / 100 in fly tissues , 1 / 200 in human cells ) , rabbit anti - pMRLC2 ( S19 ) ( Cell Signaling , 3671S , 1 / 100 ) , mouseanti - a - tubulin ( Abcam , DM1A , 1 / 100inflytissues , 1 / 200inhuman cells ) , guinea pig anti - centrosomin ( 1 / 1 , 000 , a gift from F . Pichaud ) , 4’ , 6 - diami - dino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Molecular Probes , 1 m g ml – 1 ) , Phalloidin - TRITC ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Secondary antibodies from Molecular Probes were conjugated with Alexa488 , 546 and 647 . The following antibodies were used for western blotting : rabbit anti - p - ERM ( Cell Signaling , 3141S , 1 / 100 ) , rabbit anti - moesin ( 1 / 25 , 000 , a gift from D . Kiehart ) , mouseanti - GFP ( Roche , No . 11814460001 , 1 / 500 ) , rabbitanti - Sds22 ( SantaCruz , E - 20 , 1 / 100 ) , mouse anti - c - adaptin ( BD Transduction Laboratories , No . 610386 , 1 / 1 , 000 ) and mouse anti - RacGAP1 ( Abnova , M01 , 1 / 50 , 000 ) . Quantification of protein levels at the cortex . FIJI software ( http : / / fiji . sc / Fiji ) was used to quantify the actin levels at the cell pole during anaphase ( as seen in Fig . 1f , Fig . 2e and Extended Data Fig . 1d ) . First , a kymograph of the radial cross - section was assembled for each cell ( as seen in Fig . 2a , b , yellow box denotes the LETTER RESEARCH G 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved cross - section ) . Then , the mean actin intensity was systematically measured over time by placing a 9 - pixel square region onto the polar cortex at every time point along the kymographic profile . Values were then normalized against the actin levels in metaphase . To generate the bar graphs of the actin levels , the values obtained for each cell represent the average of five values measured during a 50 - s period either before or after the onset of cell elongation . To quantify the poles / equator ( or proximal / distal ) ratios of protein levels seen in Fig . 1h , Extended Data Fig . 1e and Extended Data Fig . 3h , i , protein levels were measured by placing a small rectangle onto the polar or equatorial cortex of anaphase cells and retrieving the mean grey value ( using FIJI ) . In Fig . 3d , Extended Data Fig . 2c , d and Extended Data Fig . 4a , levels of cortical protein ( F - actinormyosinII ) werenormalizedagainstthecytoplasmicsignal . Toquantify the levels of F - actin seen in Extended Data Fig . 4b and Extended Data Fig . 6d , the levels of cortical protein under the chromatin mass were normalized against the levels of cortical signal of the whole cell area ( bottom cross - section ) . Assembly of plots : actin levels vs time and DNA - to - cortex distance vs time . FIJI software ( http : / / fiji . sc / Fiji ) was used to generate kymographs of the cortical perimeter over time ( as seen in Fig . 2g , top left ) . A line scan was drawn over the half - perimeter of each Lifeact – GFP - labelled SOP cell during early anaphase ( nine time points , 10 - s resolution ) . These lines were then straightened andcombined in the formofa kymograph ( Fig . 2g , topleft ) . Thesekymographswere savedinatext image format and subsequently binned into 9 3 9 grids of mean grey values ( not shown ) . These9 3 9gridsofactinintensityvalueswerethen‘overlaid’toobtainan averageplotofactinlevelsvstimeforallcellsanalysed ( seeninFig . 2g , bottomleft ) . In parallel to this , we measured the DNA – cortex distances , d1 – d9 , ( as seen in Fig . 2f ) ineachcellduringearlyanaphase , obtaininga9 3 9gridofdistancevstime asseeninFig . 2g , topright ) . Similarlytotheactinplots , thedistancevstimegridsof all ten cells analysed were ‘overlaid’ to obtain an average plot of distance vs time ( seen in Fig . 2g , bottom right ) . Matlab ( MathWorks ) was used to present the aforementioned plots in the form of colour maps . Graphs and statistical analysis . Various types ofgraphsareshown : bargraphsof mean withs . d .

All rights reserved Extended Data Figure 10 | Local accumulation of Sds22 triggers polar blebbing in anaphase . a , Confocal cross - sections of a representative anaphase epithelial cell showing co - localization of Sds22 and the kinetochore protein Spc25 ( 1 of 10 cells ) . Insets are of regions shown by arrowheads . b – e , Data to assess the impact of KNL1 silencing on Sds22 – GFP localization and polar relaxation . b , Representative epithelial cell expressing Sds22 – GFP imaged during anaphase , together with a corresponding kymograph of anaphase progression in c . Black arrowheads point to polar blebbing . Inverted lookup table in b , c . Darker tone indicates a stronger GFP signal . In a and b , scale bar , 5 m m . d , Line scans across kinetochore regions denoted by the green arrowheads in representative images shown in Fig . 4a . e , Levels of Sds22 – GFP at kinetochores in control ( 17 cells from four animals ) and KNL1 RNAi cells ( nine cells from three animals ) normalized against the cytoplasmic GFP signal . Graphs show mean and s . d . Significance was assessed using a two - tailed unpaired t - test . f , Graphic representation of the blue - light - induced cryptochrome - based protein – protein interaction system underlying the data shown in Fig . 4d . This scheme shows how the CRY2 - tagged Sds22 subunit interacts with membrane - tethered CIBN upon blue - light irradiation , promoting fast translocation of the phosphatase to the plasma membrane and inactivation of cortical moesin and , consequently , abrogation of F - actin linkage to the membrane .
