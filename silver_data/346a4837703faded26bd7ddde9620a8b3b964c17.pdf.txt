An increasing wealth of data indicates that in spite of variable characteristics of signaling ﬁlopodia in different biological contexts , they represent a paradigm of intercel - lular crosstalk which is presently being unraveled in a growing literature . Here , we summarize recent advances in investigating the morphology , cellular basis and function of signaling ﬁlopodia , with focus on their role during embryonic development in vertebrates . Keywords Cell – cell communication (cid:2) Actin cytoskeleton (cid:2) Microtubules Introduction The development of a vertebrate embryo is a process of immense complexity . To establish the body plan from a single cell , the zygote , very large numbers of cells need to coordinately divide , specify , differentiate and spatially rearrange during embryogenesis . In many instances , namely during induction of developmental processes by neighboring cell populations , extensive cell – cell communication is required to exchange instructive signal - ing molecules between cells . This can occur between closely adjacent cells , but also between cells separated by larger gaps , which can be ﬁlled by interstitial ﬂuid , extra - cellular matrix or other cells . In the last years , long range signaling mechanisms have been intensely investigated . In the classical morphogen model of long range cellular interaction , diffusible signal - ing molecules are secreted by donor cells , diffuse to form a concentration gradient in the interstitial space , and are sensed by recipient cells in a concentration - dependent manner . Next to this model , recent research has established that cells are able to communicate over large distances by long , thin cellular protrusions which bridge the space between them , and which enable distant cells to exchange signaling molecules even if they are not diffusible as postulated for classical morphogens . In this review , we will provide an overview on the current knowledge on cellular protrusions arising during vertebrate development . Regarding their proper designation , there is not yet a consensus between researchers , and terms vary between , e . g . , cytonemes , specialized ﬁlopodia , ﬁlopodia - like pro - trusions and others [ 1 ] . Here , we will therefore simply refer to ‘‘signaling ﬁlopodia’’ for signaling cellular protrusions , unless in certain cases special expressions have been already established , like cytonemes in the Drosophila imaginal disc . Principles of intercellular communication Morphogen gradients by diffusion The classical diffusion - based morphogen model is based on the concept that cells close to the secreting cell are exposed & Martin Scaal martin . scaal @ uk - koeln . de 1 Department of Vertebrate Embryology , Institute of Anatomy II , University of Cologne , Joseph - Stelzmann - Str . 9 , 50931 Cologne , Germany 2 Present Address : Max - Planck - Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics , Stu¨beweg 51 , 79108 Freiburg , Germany Cell .

Given threshold - dependent speciﬁc reactions of the recipient cells to the morphogen , this model can explain that cells behave differently along the morphogen gradient , thus establishing for instance positional information along body axes like in the verte - brate limb [ 2 ] . A problem of this model is its apparent lack of precision in the complex environment of embryonic tissues . By further elaborating the morphogen concept , it has been shown that morphogen uptake or degradation by the recipient cells as well as extracellular matrix properties can shape morphogen gradients [ 3 , 4 ] . In vertebrates , morphogen gradients have been suggested for BMP , Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) or Wnt signaling [ 5 , 6 ] . Even though wingless ( Wg ) gradients have been demonstrated in Dro - sophila [ 3 ] , it remains controversial how gradients of the vertebrate homologues , Wnts , can be established . Wnt proteins have highly hydrophobic residues , which are essential for their secretion and function but due to which they remain largely attached to the secreting cells [ 7 – 9 ] . Yet they are known to act at considerable distances from their sources , e . g . , in the developing chick embryo , where Wnt6 is secreted by the surface ectoderm and controls dermomyotomal cell fates [ 10 , 11 ] , even though both cell sheets are separated by the subectodermal space , which measures about 20 l m and contains a mesh of extracellular matrix . Morphogen distribution by migrating cells A different principle of intercellular communication has been suggested for the communication between the dorsal neural tube and the medial lip of the dermomyotome , which is achieved by migrating neural crest cells . Wnt1 and Wnt3a , expressed in the dorsal neural tube , induce medial fate and Wnt11 expression in the dermomyotome , which requires Wnts to bridge a distance of about 100 l m [ 12 ] . Wnt proteins have been shown to attach to migrating neural crest cells and to be transported , hitchhiking as it were , to the recipient cells in the dermomyotome [ 13 ] . This trackway could be mediated by the extracellular matrix and by cellular extensions from adjacent cells [ 14 ] . Whether dermomyotomal ﬁlopodia , which are formed by the dor - somedial lip cells of the dermomyotome [ 13 ] are involved in this process remains to be shown . However , it becomes increasingly clear that extracellular matrix proteins actively participate in this intercellular communication [ 13 , 15 ] . Morphogen transportation by ﬁlopodia Morphogen transportation by ﬁlopodia - like extensions has ﬁrst been shown in Drosophila imaginal discs , where these extensions have been named cytonemes . Cytonemes have a dual role . On one hand , they are essential for the estab - lishment of a morphogen gradient [ 16 ] ; on the other hand , they serve as signaling ﬁlopodia bridging the space between distantly located cells to deliver either mor - phogens such as Wnt and Shh proteins to recipient cells or to extend receptors such as the Wnt - receptor frizzled or Shh co - receptors to the morphogen source [ 17 – 20 ] . In the following , we will focus on this mode of ﬁlopodia - based intercellular communication . Filopodia - mediated cell – cell signaling Signaling ﬁlopodia in Drosophila Filopodia as cellular signaling extensions were ﬁrst extensively characterized in Drosophila and addressed as cytonemes [ 21 ] . These cytonemes are cytoplasmic threads that extend towards morphogen - producing regions to bring the respective receptors in close vicinity to the ligand producing cells [ 22 ] . In Drosophila , cytonemes are described in different tissues such as the eye , wing disc , and tracheal cells . The cytonemal transport of various receptors to the morphogen source has been reported in a number of signaling pathways : Branchless ( Bnl , the Dro - sophila homolog of FGF ) induces the extension of cytoneme - like , Btl ( FGF ) receptor - bearing ﬁlopodia to the Bnl / FGF - expressing cells [ 23 ] , Notch - delta ligands , where the extensions are induced by Delta to promote Notch signaling in distantly located cells [ 24 ] , Spitz / EGF that induces formation of ﬁlopodia transporting EGF receptor in form of motile puncta [ 22 ] , and the Dpp receptor thick - veins ( Tkv ) on cytonemes that orient toward the Dpp producing disc cells [ 25 ] . Recently , Hedgehog - coated cytonemes were characterized that regulate BMP signaling in Drosophila female germline stem cells to prevent their differentiation [ 26 ] . Thus , Drosophila cytonemes transport receptors or ligands and emanate either from the receptor - bearing target cell or extend from the morphogen - secreting cell [ 27 ] . Signaling ﬁlopodia in vertebrates Increasing experimental evidence demonstrates that inter - cellular communication via signaling ﬁlopodia also exists in vertebrates . As they have been independently detected in various cell types , researchers have differently named them as , e . g . , tunneling nanotubes in different cell lines [ 28 ] , cytoplasmic bridges in zebraﬁsh epiblast cells [ 29 ] , ﬁlopodia - like protrusions ( FiLiPs ) in chick dermomy - otomal cells [ 20 ] , or specialized ﬁlopodia in chick limb buds [ 19 ] . As in Drosophila , vertebrate signaling ﬁlopodia transport receptors to the morphogen - producing cell . 962 F . Pro¨ls et al . 123 Likewise , ligands can be transported via protrusions extending from the signaling cell to contact the target cell either at the cell body or at receptor - presenting protrusions . In spite of species and cell type speciﬁc differences , sig - naling ﬁlopodia seem to represent a general concept of cell – cell communication ( see Fig . 1 ) . Except for mammalian blastocyst traversing ﬁlopodia that are formed early and keep intercellular contact when the cells are separated over long distances [ 30 ] , most sig - naling ﬁlopodia are highly dynamic and show probing movements , but can form stable contacts with transport activity as soon as they contact their proper target cells [ 19 , 20 , 30 – 32 ] . Such stable contacts were also described as tunneling nanotubes ( TNTs ) , which connect cells over long distances and transfer various cellular components from cell to cell [ 29 , 33 ] . TNTs are used for the intercellular exchange of cellular cargos such as eGFP - actin , organelles / vesicles of endocytic origin , plasma membrane molecules , MHCI molecules in case of immune cells , and even mitochondria , prions and human immunodeﬁciency virus ( HIV ) , but also for electrical coupling and mechanotrans - duction [ 34 ] . Hallmarks of signaling ﬁlopodia in vertebrates are listed in Table 1 . Signaling ﬁlopodia in Wnt signaling Next to Shh signaling in the limb bud mesenchyme [ 19 , 35 , 36 ] , Wnt signaling has been a focus in recent research on ﬁlopodia - mediated cell – cell signaling in vertebrate embryos . In zebraﬁsh and Xenopus , and presumably also in chick , the transfer of Wnt protein from the secreting to the responding cell is mediated by signaling ﬁlopodia ( see below ) . In zebraﬁsh , recent work has shown that specialized ﬁlopodia mediate the paracrine transport of canonical Wnt8a during neural plate patterning [ 17 ] . Wnt8a is pre - sented at the ﬁlopodial tips of the Wnt8a producing cells and colocalizes with Evi / Wls , a specialized cargo receptor , which binds to Wnts through palmitate moieties . Approx - imately , 10 min after contact formation , the extensions are shortened , and Wnt8a - positive tips form extracellular punctate , which are attached to neighboring cells [ 17 , 37 ] ( Fig . 1a ) . In the recipient cell Wnt8a co - localizes with the Wnt - receptor Frizzled ( Fzd ) and its co - receptor Lrp6 [ 17 ] . The clustering of ligand , receptor and co - receptor initiates the recruitment of intracellular Wnt transducers , such as Dishevelled2 ( Dvl2 ) and Axin1 , to assemble the so - called ‘‘signalosome’’ [ 17 , 38 , 39 ] . This mechanism is similar to the synaptic contact of neurons , where the transmitter is transported along the entire axon to be released from the presynaptic membrane and taken up postsynaptically by the responding neuron . In Xenopus ﬁbroblasts , EGFP - labeled Xwnt2a has been shown to move along microtubules in protrusions of Wnt - producing cells and is transferred to ﬁlopodia of the recipient cells ( Fig . 1b ) . Subsequently , Xwnt2b – EGFP becomes endocytosed by the Wnt receiving cell and moves retrogradely together with the retracting protrusions [ 18 ] . In chicken embryos , Wnt signals from the surface ectoderm regulate development of the somite epithelium across the subectodermal space , which contains dense extracellular matrix [ 10 , 11 , 40 ] . Recently , ﬁlopodia have been documented in chick dermomyotomal cells that reach out through the subectodermal space to the overlying ectoderm ( Fig . 1c ) . These ﬁlopodia contain motile trans - membranous Fzd7 receptors , which are extended to close vicinity to the Wnt - producing cells and are likely to mediate the observed ectodermal – dermomyotomal cross - talk [ 20 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . In mammalian embryos , ﬁlopodia have so far not been linked to Wnt signaling . However , a similar concept has emerged for FGFR2 and ErbB3 - positive protrusions that span over the murine blastocoelic cavity to connect the mural trophectoderm with the cells of the inner cell mass [ 30 ] . Formation and retrograde transport of ligand / receptor complexes in signaling ﬁlopodia In vitro studies indicate that in EGF and FGF signaling , after delivery of the ligand , the ligand – receptor complex travels to the cell body to induce the signaling cascade Fig . 1 Three variants of long - distance intercellular communication via signaling ﬁlopodia . Stable connections are formed between signaling cell ( light gray cells on the left ) and target cell ( dark gray cells on the right ) . a The ligand secreting cell locates the ligand directly at the target cell and retracts the ﬁlopodium after ligand delivery . b The receptor - bearing target cell extends long signaling ﬁlopodia to the ligand secreting target cell . c Both , the ligand secreting and the receptor - bearing target cell extend signaling protrusions to contact Signaling ﬁlopodia in vertebrate embryonic development 963 123 T a b l e 1 F ea t u r e s o f s i gn a li ng ﬁ l opod i a d e s c r i b e d a nd c h a r ac t e r i ze d i n v e r t e b r a t e s p ec i e s S p ec i e s L o ca ti on a nd f un c ti on o f ﬁ l opod i a L e ng t h a nd d i a m e t e r ( l m ) D yn a m i c s C h a r ac t e r i s ti c s o f dyn a m i c a nd s t a b l e ﬁ l opod i a R e f e r e n ce s Z e b r a ﬁ s h e m b r yo E p i b l a s t ce ll s i n b l a s t u l a F un c ti on D e lt a - no t c h s i gn a li ng A v e r a g e l e ng t h 215 l m ( r a ng e 60 – 380 l m ) D i a m e t e r : 1 l m S t ab l e ﬁ l op od i a : ‘‘ i n t e r ce ll u l a r b r i dg e s ’’ D e lt a - po s iti v e ﬁ l opod i a A c ti n po s iti v e T ubu li n on l y a t t h e b a s e s C a r go t r a n s po r t : v = 55 n m / s [ 29 ] Z e b r a ﬁ s h e m b r yo A s ub s e t o f m i g r a ti ng N CC s C X CR 4 - G FP l o ca li ze s t o f s c n1 a - d e p e nd e n t ﬁ l opod i a A c ti n po s iti v e [ 50 ] Z e b r a ﬁ s h e m b r yo E p it h e li a l ce ll s i n t h e p r e s u m p ti v e n e u r o ec t od e r m W n t 8 a - v e nu s po s iti v e ‘‘ pun c t a ’’ a t ﬁ l opod i a l ti p i s r e l ea s e d a s t h e ﬁ l opod i u m r e t r ac t s F o r m a ti on o f W n t 8 a / F z d9b c l u s t e r s [ 37 ] Z e b r a ﬁ s h e m b r yo T r a n s f ec t e d e p i b l a s t ce ll s F un c ti on N e u r a l p l a t e p a tt e r n i ng A v e r a g e l e ng t h : 16 . 6 l m ( up t o 50 l m ) D i a m e t e r m a x 1 . 5 l m W n t 8 a - e G FP - po s iti v e ﬁ l opod i a l ti p s g i v e r i s e t o e x t r ace ll u l a r pun c t a , w h i c h a r e a tt ac h e d t o t a r g e t ce ll s O n s t ab l e ﬁ l opod i a f o r m a ti on o f ‘‘ s i gn a l o s o m e s ’’ : c l u s t e r s o f W n t 8 a a nd L r p6 - G FP , D v l - m C h e rr y ( o r A x i n1 ) on t h e t a r g e t ce ll [ 17 ] Z e b r a ﬁ s h e m b r yo H E K 293 ce ll s , ﬁ s h ﬁ b r ob l a s t s P A C 2 , m ou s e 3 T 3 L e ng t h i n P A C 2 ce ll s : up t o 70 l m E l ong a ti on : a v e r a g e v = 110 n m / s M a x . v = 240 n m / s W n t 8 a - e G FP - po s iti v e , s t a b l e ﬁ l opod i a A c ti n po s iti v e T ubu li n a t t h e b a s e M yo s i n10 po s iti v e C d c 42 d e t e r m i n e s t h e l e ng t h o f W n t - po s iti v e ﬁ l opod i a [ 17 ] X e nopu s B l a s t o c y s t F un c ti on C onn ec ti ng b l a s t o m e r e s L e ng t h S ho r t dyn a m i c ﬁ l opod i a 10 l m L ong b l a s t o c o e l t r a v e r s i ng ﬁ l opod i a up t o 250 l m D i a m e t e r : 0 . 2 – 0 . 7 l m D yn a m i c ﬁ l opod i a PF A s t a b l e S t ab l e ﬁ l o pod i a s p a nn i ng t h e b l a s t o c o e l ca v it y E x c h a ng e o f c y t op l a s m a nd m e m b r a n e C a v e o l a r e ndo c y t o s i s a t p r ox i m a l b a s e A c ti n po s iti v e T ubu li n n e g a ti v e ( a - t ubu li n s t a i n i ng ) R e t r o - a nd a n t e r og r a d e v e s i c l e t r a n s po r t ( v = 1 – 3 l m / s ) PF A s t a b l e [ 31 ] 964 F .

In mouse mesenchymal cells , FGF receptor - bearing protrusions grow in the direction of the FGF ligand and bind FGF and Rab5 , which is localized to the early endosome membranes , to form a ternary complex . This complex associates with nodules that move retrogradely through the protrusions to the cell’s body [ 41 ] . The same has been shown for com - plexes containing EGF ligand and the activated ErbB1 receptor that are retrogradely transported to the cell body and endocytosed , a process that only occurs at the base of the ﬁlopodia [ 42 ] . In zebraﬁsh , Wnt8 , presented on cellular protrusions , clusters with Fzd9b and intracellular signal transducers on the membrane of the target cell [ 37 ] . For signal transduction this complex needs to be endocytosed [ 39 ] . In this case no ﬁlopodia are formed by the target cell so that the ligand / receptor complex is formed directly on the membrane of the recipient cell body and no retrograde transport is required prior to signaling . Speciﬁcity of signaling ﬁlopodia Very interestingly , in Drosophila tracheal cells , different subsets of cytonemes have been reported . One type of cytonemes is made in response to Bnl / FGF , to which the cells synthesize the respective Bnl receptor , and another type of cytonemes of the same cell harbors the Dpp receptor [ 22 ] . This means that receptor - harboring cyto - nemes are not restricted to a speciﬁc subset of cells but that one cell can send out different subsets of cytonemes with the selective presence of a particular receptor . A similar phenomenon has been reported for the ﬁlopodia - based transport of Shh and the co - receptors Boc and Cdo in chicken mesenchymal cells . Shh particles of appr . 200 nm in size travel only to speciﬁc subsets of ﬁlopodia of donor cells . Similarly , in recipient cells , Boc and Cdo localize to microdomains within only a subset of ﬁlopodia [ 19 ] , revealing that the spatial distribution of ligands and receptors is tightly regulated . In chick , only a subset of dermomyotomal ﬁlopodia harbor the Wnt - receptor Fzd7 and seem to fetch their respective Wnt signaling protein from the overlying Wnt - producing ectoderm [ 20 ] . Whether these or the other Fzd7 - negative protrusions harbor other receptors has not been investigated in this study . Endogenous cellular ability to form signaling ﬁlopodia The current data indicate that the formation of signaling ﬁlopodia is a cell autonomous process , which is endoge - nously regulated by the ﬁlopodia - forming cells . In mammalian cells , it has been shown that expression of the stem cell markers Lgr4 and Lgr5 induces and drives the formation of membrane protrusions [ 32 ] . Lgr4 and Lgr5 are G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCR ) that identify a subpopulation of intestinal crypt stem cells and progenitor cells in the intestinal crypt , respectively [ 43 ] . In chicken and zebraﬁsh embryos and also in cells cultured in vitro , ﬁlopodia formation occurs in vitro in the absence of target cells [ 17 , 20 , 32 , 41 , 42 ] , a feature that clearly documents the cell autonomy of protrusion formation . However , these cellular protrusions can be very long compared to the in vivo situation , are highly dynamic and not polarized but extending in all directions [ 17 , 20 ] . The length of ﬁlopodia seems not only to be controlled by contact formation with the target cell but also depend on the intactness of the downstream signaling . In Drosophila Hh signaling , it was shown that ﬁlopodia that reach their target are not only stabilized but respond by up to sixfold elongation in case of experimentally impaired signaling of the target cell [ 26 ] . Length and dynamics of signaling ﬁlopodia Signaling ﬁlopodia have been described as stable and dynamic subtypes , which are likely different states of the same structures , meaning that dynamic ﬁlopodia are intermediate stages without contact to the target cell and presumably without signaling activity , and stable ﬁlopodia have established contact to the target cell and are active in signaling as shown by , e . g . , Frz7 receptor trafﬁcking [ 20 ] . The length of signaling ﬁlopodia is obviously dependent on the distance to the target cells and can be very variable within and between different embryonic structures . In zebraﬁsh , it has been shown that intercellular bridges are formed between Delta - and Notch - positive ﬁlopodia . These epiblast - derived ﬁlopodia in the zebraﬁsh blastula have an average length of 215 l m ( 60 – 380 l m ) [ 29 ] . Also Fig . 2 Signaling ﬁlopodia spanning the subectodermal space in the chicken embryo . Somitic cells ( red ) were labeled by overexpression of pCAGGS - H2B - mCherry - pA , nuclei ( blue ) are stained with DAPI , actin ( green ) was stained using Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin . Filopodia are spanning the distance of about 20 l m ( * ) between the dermomy - otome ( dm ) and the ectoderm ( ect ) 968 F . Pro¨ls et al . 123 in zebraﬁsh , Wnt8a is transported in ﬁlopodia that extend from epithelial cells of the presumptive neuroectoderm to the target site . These Wnt8a containing ﬁlopodia retract and leave Wnt8a in the vicinity of target cells [ 37 ] . The average length of these signaling ﬁlopodia is 16 . 6 l m , reaching up to 50 l m in vivo and up to 70 l m in vitro . They are formed at an average speed of 110 nm / s as has been determined in cultured zebraﬁsh ﬁbroblasts [ 17 ] . Signaling ﬁlopodia in mouse and chick are known to carry the morphogen receptors FGFR2 , ErbB3 or Fzd7 , respectively [ 20 , 30 ] . These ﬁlopodia are initially formed as short protrusions that extend in all directions in a probing manner until they reach their target and form stable connections . The length of the epithelial ﬁlopodia in the mouse blastocyst ranges up to 34 . 6 l m , depending on the degree of blastocyst extension [ 30 ] . Epithelial ﬁlopodia in the chicken dermomyotome extend up to 20 l m , which is the width of the subectodermal space between the der - momyotomal and ectodermal layer . In the absence of the ectoderm , ﬁlopodia can become considerably longer . The extension and retraction speed of the dynamic subtype is at an average of 53 . 76 and 68 . 80 nm / s , respectively [ 20 ] . In the chicken limb , the ﬁlopodia connecting distantly located mesenchymal cells have an average length of 34 . 27 l m but can reach up to a length of 150 l m , with a maximum speed of elongation velocity of 150 nm / s [ 19 ] . These ﬁlopodia extend from both sites , the signaling and the responding cells , being equipped with the morphogen Shh and the Shh co - receptors Cdo and Boc [ 19 ] . Both receptor - and ligand bearing ﬁlopodia , which are bound to their target cell , are stabilized and less dynamic than non - target bound ﬁlopo - dia , a process that has been described by Sanders et al . [ 19 ] as ‘‘dynamic probing of the extracellular environment’’ . Cytoskeleton of signaling ﬁlopodia For building up morphogen gradients [ 16 ] and for deliv - ering ligands to distantly located cells , ligands have to be transported with or along the ﬁlopodia in an anterograde direction . In the responding cell , receptors and ligand – re - ceptor complexes need to be transported retrogradely towards the cell body to induce the respective signaling cascades . The formation of ﬁlopodia as well as antero - and retrograde transport are based on the cytoskeleton , the major constituents of which are actin and tubulin . Actin Similar to cytonemata in Drosophila [ 21 ] , the cytoskeleton of all signaling ﬁlopodia in vertebrates is actin based . In chick dermomyotomal ﬁlopodia , which span the subecto - dermal space , phalloidin staining showed the entire length of ﬁlopodia to contain actin ﬁlaments [ 20 ] . Phalloidin also stained the entire length of mouse blastocoel spanning ﬁlopodia that connect the inner cell mass with the trophoectodermal cells [ 30 ] as well as the long Lgr5 - in - duced ﬁlopodia in HEK cells [ 32 ] . Filopodia of different mammalian cells in culture as well as Xenopus ﬁbroblasts stained positive for ﬂuorophore labeled actin [ 18 , 42 ] . Intercellular bridges of zebraﬁsh epiblast cells expressed transgenic EGFP - actin along their entire length [ 29 ] , and also in zebraﬁsh epiblast cells and in PAC2 cells the entire length of the Wnt8a - positive ﬁlopodia stained with LifeAct [ 17 ] . Yet , in chick mesenchymal ﬁlopodia , the highly actin - speciﬁc LifeAct staining was limited to the proximal base while the high afﬁnity F - actin probe utrophin calponin homology domain ( UCHD ) - EGFP and moesin - GFP labeled the entire length of the ﬁlopodia [ 19 ] indicating that , though LifeAct negative , the entire ﬁlopodia are actin positive . The failure of LifeAct to stain actin ﬁlaments in the shaft and tip of signaling ﬁlopodia is discussed to be due to either actin modiﬁcations or to decoration of the actin ﬁlaments with binding proteins that disturb actin recognition by LifeAct [ 19 , 44 ] . Actin ﬁlaments are sta - bilized when highly decorated with ADP / coﬁlin [ 45 , 46 ] . Whether this is the protein decoration that inhibits LifeAct staining is not known . Yet , it has been reported that these protein decorations or actin modiﬁcations very likely vary in time but also between species or ﬁlopodial types [ 46 ] . According to the data presently available all signaling ﬁlopodia have an actin - based cytoskeleton irrespective of LifeAct negative results . While the cytoskeleton of lamellipodia consists of bran - ched actin ﬁlaments , the cytoskeleton of ﬁlopodia is based on straight , parallelly aligned actin ﬁlaments , the initiation , elongation and termination of which is a highly complex and strictly regulated process . Initiation of the actin ﬁlament formation is mediated by a nucleation complex , where dif - ferent kinds of actin nucleators can work synergistically to promote actin polymerization [ 47 ] . N - WASP ( neural Wis - kott - Aldrich syndrome protein ) functions as a nucleation promoting factor , which stimulates the ability of Arp2 / 3 to induce actin polymerization . Instead of N - WASP , members of the formin family , such as mDia2 , can also mediate actin nucleation . In addition , mDia2 can promote continued elongation of uncapped actin ﬁlaments [ 41 ] , a process that is also mediated by another formin , mDia3C , when complexed with the small GTPase RhoD [ 41 ] . Prerequisite for actin elongation is the uncapped stage of the growing , barbed end of actin ﬁlaments , which is achieved by VASP ( vasodilator uncapping protein ) , which next to its uncapping function also delivers actin monomers to the growing tip of ﬁlopodia [ 48 ] ( Fig . 3 ) . Bundling of the straight actin ﬁlaments is mediated by fascin1 ( FSCN1 ) , which cross - links actin ﬁlaments to become Signaling ﬁlopodia in vertebrate embryonic development 969 123 stiff bundles in the shaft of ﬁlopodia [ 49 , 50 ] . FSCN1 labels ﬁlopodial extensions [ 51 ] and can increase the efﬁciency of Ena / VASP - associated actin polymerization [ 52 ] . It is also essential for the localization of receptors in ﬁlopodial exten - sions as has been shown in neural crest cells , in which FSCN1a promotes the directional migration by localizing the receptor CXCR4a to ﬁlopodia , which allows efﬁcient responses to local chemokine signals such as Cxcl12b [ 50 ] . In Lgr5 - induced , in Cdc42 - induced , and in chick dermomy - otomal ﬁlopodia , fascin is homogenously distributed throughout the protrusions [ 20 , 32 , 41 ] . In contrast , in RhoD - induced ﬁlopodia fascin was either only intermittently dis - tributed along the ﬁlopodia or they contained no fascin at all . This incomplete association with fascin is discussed to render the protrusions more ﬂexible [ 41 ] . Filopodia formation is a dynamic process : in vivo imaging of cell migration showed that ﬁlopodia are rapidly generated in the direction of chemo - attractive cues but collapse when exposed to repulsive cues [ 53 ] . The dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton requires assembly and disassembly of actin ﬁlaments . Stabilization is supported by high ADP / coﬁlin concentrations [ 45 ] while disassembly is mediated by the combined action of ADP / coﬁlin and Aip1 [ 46 , 54 ] . In accordance with previously described ﬁlopodia [ 55 ] , chicken dermomyotomal as well as mes - enchymal ﬁlopodia contain coﬁlin [ 19 , 20 ] . Coﬁlin has been shown to localize to speciﬁc microdomains along chick mesenchymal ﬁlopodia [ 19 ] . It accumulates rapidly at the tips of limb mesenchymal ﬁlopodia and its subse - quent retraction back to the cell soma preﬁgures the rapid and dynamic retraction of ﬁlopodial extensions [ 19 ] . Cargo transport along ﬁlopodia is closely linked to the presence of the unconventional Myosin10 ( Myo10 , MyoX ) protein , a member of the ﬁlopodial tip complex [ 56 ] . It is an actin motor protein and has been shown to travel along actin - rich ﬁlopodia and deliver cargo ( ligands as well as receptors ) to the ﬁlopodial tips [ 57 , 58 ] . In zebraﬁsh embryos , Myo10 - GFP move to the distal tips of Wnt8a - positive ﬁlopodia during the contact formation process where it accumulates [ 17 ] . In Lgr5 - induced ﬁlopodia , Myo10 travels along the ﬁlopodia and , when co - expressed with the receptor b 2 - AR , translocates the adapter protein b - arrestin2 [ 32 ] . Translocation of b - arrestin2 is a hallmark of prototypical G - protein - coupled receptor signaling and receptor desensitization [ 59 , 60 ] . Also in chick mes - enchymal ﬁlopodia , Myo10 - GFP has been shown to move to the distal tips , where it accumulates [ 19 ] . Myo10 plays an essential role not only in the formation and cargo transport of signaling ﬁlopodia but also in the delivery of integrins to the cell surface to increase cell adhesion [ 57 , 58 ] . This Myo10 - dependent transport of integrins to the ﬁlopodial tips is not primarily linked to the signaling properties of ﬁlopodia but is discussed to be essential for tumor invasiveness [ 61 ] and metastasis [ 62 ] . Signaling molecules Key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton are members of the Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatases ( Rho - GTPases ) such as RhoD , Rac1 , cdc42 . These Rho - GTPases act as molecular switches by cycling from the active GTP - bound form to the inactive GDP - bound form , thereby activating downstream targets . The GTPase activity is stimulated by GAPs ( GTPase activating proteins ) while GEPs ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) recycle the inactive GDP - bound form into the active GTP - bound form Fig . 3 The Rho family of small GTPases regulates actin polymerization and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by cycling between inactive GDP - bound and active GTP - bound forms ( * ) . GTPase - stimulating protein ( GAP ) ; guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) . Members of the Rho family are RhoD , Rac1 , cdc42 . The formin mDia2 nucleates unbranched ﬁlaments , continues elongation of uncapped actin ﬁlaments and can also replace N - WASP in its function as nucleator protein . For details on the other actin - associated molecules shown , please refer to ‘‘Actin’’ section 970 F . Pro¨ls et al . 123 ( Fig . 3 ) . Filopodia formation is mediated by either one of the above listed RhoGTPases or even by a concerted interaction between them . Accordingly , modulation of these small RhoGTPases affects ﬁlopodia formation [ 63 ] . In zebraﬁsh , the formation of Wnt8a - positive ﬁlopodia depends on Cdc42 activity . Overexpression of Cdc42 results in ﬁlopodial branching in PAC2 cells while treat - ment with the Cdc42 GTPase inhibitor ML14139 resulted in a strong reduction in the number of protrusions formed [ 17 ] . Furthermore , Toca1 ( transducer of Cdc42 - dependent actin assembly1 [ 64 ] ) , which is a core member of the Cdc42 / N - WASP nucleation complex and one of the earli - est localization markers of outgrowing ﬁlopodia , co - localizes with Wnt8a - mCherry at the plasma membrane before protrusion formation and remains at outgrowing ﬁlopodial tips [ 17 ] . Active Cdc42 and N - WASP are bound by IRSp53 ( Rho family GTPase effector insulin tyrosine kinase substrate p53 ) , the localization of which reveals a spotted pattern along the Zebraﬁsh epiblast - derived ﬁlopodia [ 17 ] . Interestingly , conditional inactivation of Cdc42 in the chicken limb bud did not perturb mes - enchymal ﬁlopodia formation [ 19 ] , indicating that ﬁlopodial protrusion is also controlled by GTPases other than Cdc42 . Activation of RhoD promotes , e . g . , the for - mation of FGF - induced ﬁlopodia in murine mesenchymal cells . RhoD was shown to facilitate actin polymerization by complexing with mDia3c . Accordingly , knockdown of RhoD interfered with FGF - induced protrusion formation [ 41 ] . In murine mesenchymal cells , Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia differ from RhoD - induced ﬁlopodia with respect to their length , thickness , straightness and microtubular composi - tion ( see below ) . This is discussed to be due to the formation of focal adhesions in Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia whereas focal adhesions collapse in the presence of acti - vated RhoD [ 41 ] . Cdc42 plays a pivotal role in cytoskeletal rearrangements [ 65 ] and induces de novo ﬁlopodia for - mation via activation of N - WASP as has been shown in cell culture [ 66 ] as well as during murine embryonic development , in which Cdc42 largely controls skin devel - opment and tubulogenesis in pancreas , kidney and intestine [ 63 ] . The RhoGTPase Rac1 has also the ability to coordinate the activation of signaling cascades that control the reor - ganization of the actin cytoskeleton and ultimately the formation of cellular protrusions . Genetic ablation of Rac1 in mouse embryonic limb bud ectoderm results in severe truncation of limbs . Molecular analyses revealed a dis - ruption of the Wnt - dependent , G a q / 11 / bc - PI3K - Rac1 - JNK2 - mediated , canonical pathway [ 67 ] . Rac1 - dependent path - ways predominantly affect lamellipodia formation and as such cell movement [ 53 , 68 , 69 ] , yet Rac1 has also been implicated in endocytotic processes [ 70 – 72 ] . Interestingly , overexpression of a dominant - negative form of Rac1 ( dnRac1 ) resulted in abrogation of dermomyotomal sig - naling ﬁlopodia in the chick [ 20 ] . Dysfunctional signaling cascades , in general , seem to affect ﬁlopodial dynamics . In Drosophila disruption of the signaling pathway of the receptor - bearing recipient cells leads to considerable elongation of ligand transporting cytonemata [ 26 ] pointing towards the plasticity of the signaling ﬁlopodia . Likewise , abrogated ﬁlopodia formation in dnRac1 transfected der - momyotomal cells could be due to defective endocytosis and subsequent dysfunctional signaling , a postulated feedback mechanism that remains to be shown . In summary , ﬁlopodia formation is largely controlled by individual members of the family of small Rho - GTPases , which rearrange actin ﬁlaments along which ligands and receptors can be transported . Microtubules Most of the signaling ﬁlopodia described so far are nega - tive for microtubules , which is in accordance with those described in Drosophila [ 21 ] . However , in several organ - isms microtubules have been described in at least a subset of ﬁlopodial subtypes . In zebraﬁsh , microtubule - positive ﬁlopodial bases exist in epiblast cells with a - tubulin being present only in the proximal portion of the intercellular bridges [ 29 ] . Micro - tubule - positive proximal bases also exist in Wnt - positive extensions as shown by the localization of the microtubule - associated protein DCK - GFP in microinjected zebraﬁsh epiblast cells while shafts and tips of the ﬁlopodia are tubulin negative [ 17 ] . For a subset of ﬁlopodia in the chicken limb bud the microtubular markers Tau and EB3 were described to be restricted to proximal bases of mes - enchymal ﬁlopodia [ 19 ] . In contrast , the entire lengths of ﬁlopodia were actin and tubulin positive in Xenopus ﬁbroblasts where Wnt protein is transported along these tubulin - positive ﬁlopodia [ 18 ] . Tubulin and actin - positive ﬁlopodia also exist in chicken dermomyotomal cells [ 20 ] . These actin - and tubulin - positive ﬁlopodia are resistant to PFA ﬁxation [ 18 , 20 ] . In mouse blastocysts , three types of ﬁlopodia have been described : long blastocoel traversing ﬁlopodia that connect the inner cell mass ( ICM ) with the trophectoderm ( TE ) , short ﬁlopodia that underly the ICM and TE surface and cellular projections , named ‘‘junctional extensions’’ that originate in junctional TE cells and lie in the transition area between ICM and TE . The analysis of microtubular structures within these ﬁlopodia reveals a diverse pattern [ 30 ] . While short and traversing extensions were unaf - fected by colchicine treatment , which inhibits tubulin polymerization , colchicine treatment resulted in retraction of the junctional extensions in 72 % of the embryos . This Signaling ﬁlopodia in vertebrate embryonic development 971 123 suggests that only a subpopulation is tubulin positive [ 30 , 73 ] . Different types of ﬁlopodial extensions were also characterized in mouse mesenchymal cells , in which for - mation of ﬁlopodia were induced by overexpression of constitutively active Cdc42 or by overexpression of con - stitutively active RhoD . The Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia are shorter ( \ 10 l m ) , thicker , straight and contain actin ﬁla - ment bundles and microtubules . Constitutively activated RhoD - induced short and long ﬁlopodia , both of which contained no microtubules [ 41 ] . In general , actin - positive / tubulin - negative ﬁlopodia , as described for ﬁlopodia in zebraﬁsh , mouse , and chick embryos as well as for mammalian cells lines , are very fragile and cannot be ﬁxed with conventional ﬁxation techniques . These signaling ﬁlopodia are described to transport receptors as well as ligands [ 17 , 19 , 29 , 42 , 74 ] . Actin - and tubulin - positive ﬁlopodia , in contrast , seem to be less fragile and more resistant to PFA ﬁxation . These ﬁlopodia contain actin and tubulin ﬁlaments along their entire lengths [ 18 , 20 , 30 , 41 ] . Up to now , only receptors have been reported to be transported along these actin - and tubulin - positive ﬁlopodia [ 20 ] . Cargo transport along signaling ﬁlopodia Antero - and retrograde cargo transport along the signaling ﬁlopodia seem to be largely linked to the actin cytoskeleton . In chick and zebraﬁsh embryos ligand net anterograde transport is reported for Shh and Wnt8a proteins [ 17 , 19 ] . Both ﬁlopodia were characterized by the existence of microtubules at the proximal base ( see above ) while ﬁlopo - dial shaft and tip were tubulin negative . Accordingly , Shh transport , with a maximum velocity of anterograde particle movement of 120 nm / s , is consistent with actin - based myosin motors [ 19 , 57 ] . Wnt8a transport is also actin based and characterized in detail . Before the outgrowth of ﬁlopo - dial protrusions Wnta8a is localized at the plasma membrane together with Toca1 , and transported to the ﬁlopodial tip via the actin - coupled motor protein Myo10 [ 17 ] . Microtubule - assisted transport has been reported in cultured Xenopus ﬁbroblast cells , where Wnt2b is trans - ported anterogradely along the microtubules at a velocity of 763 nm / s and this transport was impaired after noco - dazole treatment [ 18 ] . The velocity of the transport as well as the fact that the transport is nocodazole sensitive are strong indicators that Wnt2b transport is mediated by the microtubular system . The retrograde transport of receptors also seems basi - cally to be actin associated . In chick mesenchymal cells with predominantly tubulin - negative ﬁlopodial structures , the Shh coreceptors Cdo and Boc are transported retro - gradely [ 19 ] . Due to the availability of microtubules in chick dermomyotomal ﬁlopodia , the reported retrograde transport of Fzd7 receptor could be tubulin based . Inter - estingly , these ﬁlopodia contain the microtubule - associated motor proteins dynein and kinesin . Yet , with the measured average velocities ranging between 56 and 63 nm / s [ 20 ] Fzd7 trafﬁcking is still well in the range of actin - associated retrograde cargo transport [ 75 ] . Also in cultured mam - malian cells the retrograde transport of the ErbB1 receptor is linked , by its binding to a postulated adapter protein , to the actin cytoskeleton . This transport can be disrupted by cytochalasin D , an inhibitor of actin polymerization , but not by nocodazole , a disruptor of microtubule dynamics [ 42 ] . The measured velocities of the ErbB1 transport on the ﬁlopodia ( mean velocity 22 nm / s ) is within the range of values ( up to 55 nm / s ) that were reported for actin retro - grade ﬂow in vivo [ 75 , 76 ] . The experimental differentiation between actin - and tubulin - based cargo is not trivial since chemical disruption of F - actin not only impairs actin - based cargo transport but also ﬁlopodia for - mation . Yet , the estimated microtubular - assisted transport is expected to be very fast . The maximum velocity of kinesin measured in cells is 1 . 5 – 2 . 4 l m / s [ 77 ] . Outlook Next to classical diffusion models , ﬁlopodia - based long range signaling has emerged as a general concept of intercellular crosstalk , both in cell culture and during embryonic development . This concept will likely be dis - covered in many more biological contexts than the presently known model systems and will help to understand the signaling capacity over a distance even of low - dif - fusible morphogens like Wnts . As yet , a reliable tool to speciﬁcally disrupt ﬁlopodia formation is missing , which will be essential to study the importance of ﬁlopodial sig - naling in greater detail . With the rapidly growing research efforts on signaling ﬁlopodia in both cell and develop - mental biology , the avenue to establish their role as a general principle of biological signaling is open .
