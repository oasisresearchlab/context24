Gojon 1 * In Arabidopsis the plasma membrane nitrate transceptor ( trans - porter / receptor ) NRT1 . 1 governs many physiological and devel - opmental responses to nitrate . Alongside facilitating nitrate uptake , NRT1 . 1 regulates the expression levels of many nitrate assimilation pathway genes , modulates root system architecture , relieves seed dormancy and protects plants from ammonium toxicity . Here , we assess the functional and pheno - typic consequences of point mutations in two key residues of NRT1 . 1 ( P492 and T101 ) . We show that the point mutations dif - ferentially affect several of the NRT1 . 1 - dependent responses to nitrate , namely the repression of lateral root development at low nitrate concentrations , and the short - term upregulation of the nitrate - uptake gene NRT2 . 1 , and its longer - term downregu - lation , at high nitrate concentrations . We also show that these mutations have differential effects on genome - wide gene expression . Our ﬁ ndings indicate that NRT1 . 1 activates four separate signalling mechanisms , which have independent structural bases in the protein . In particular , we present evidence to suggest that the phosphorylated and non - phos - phorylated forms of NRT1 . 1 at T101 have distinct signalling functions , and that the nitrate - dependent regulation of root development depends on the phosphorylated form . Our ﬁ nd - ings add to the evidence that NRT1 . 1 is able to trigger indepen - dent signalling pathways in Arabidopsis in response to different environmental conditions . Plants are sessile organisms that face dramatic ﬂ uctuations of external mineral nutrient availability . Thus , they have developed sophisticated nutrient sensing systems , which activate physiological and developmental responses that prevent nutrient de ﬁ ciency or toxicity . To date , most of nutrient sensing systems remain unknown at the molecular level 1 . One exception is the sensing of nitrate ( NO 3 − ) , which relies largely on ‘ transceptors ’ , that is mem - brane NO 3 − carriers ful ﬁ lling a dual transport / sensing function 2 – 6 . The most documented NO 3 − transceptor is NRT1 . 1 of Arabidopsis thaliana 7 – 9 , also called CHL1 ( ref . 6 ) or NPF6 . 3 ( ref . 10 ) . Initially characterized as a dual - af ﬁ nity transporter involved in root uptake and root - to - shoot translocation of NO 3 − ( refs 11 , 12 ) , NRT1 . 1 was later shown to mediate an impressive number of responses to NO 3 − ( ref . 8 ) , among which three have been extensively investigated . First , NRT1 . 1 is required for the ‘ primary nitrate response ’ ( PNR ) , that is the short - term regulation of gene expression upon ﬁ rst NO 3 − supply . This includes the fast induction of many genes of the NO 3 − assimilation pathway such as NRT2 . 1 , which encodes a main component of the root NO 3 − uptake system 13 – 15 . Second , NRT1 . 1 is also responsible in the longer term for an opposite response of some of these genes ( for example NRT2 . 1 ) that are feed - back repressed by high nitrogen provision 13 , 16 . Third , NRT1 . 1 was shown to promote root branching in response to NO 3 − ( refs 17 , 18 ) , in particular by repressing the emergence of lateral root primordia ( LRP ) at low NO 3 − availability 19 . How NRT1 . 1 can control such a large palette of responses to NO 3 − is not understood . Two different models have been proposed . On the one hand , the signalling role of NRT1 . 1 in the PNR was reported to be independent of the transport function of the protein . Indeed , the PNR is unaffected by P492L substitution ( chl1 - 9 mutation ) that sup - presses NRT1 . 1 NO 3 − transport activity 14 . Furthermore , the PNR is negatively affected by phosphorylation of NRT1 . 1 at the T101 residue 14 , suggesting that it is the non - phosphorylated form that is predominantly active in NO 3 − signalling . On the other hand , the NRT1 . 1 - dependent repression of LRP emergence at low NO 3 − avail - ability was explained by auxin transport activity of NRT1 . 1 19 . We pro - posed that NRT1 . 1 mediates NO 3 − - inhibited auxin transport that exports the hormone out of the LRPs at low NO 3 − concentration , thus preventing the auxin accumulation in these organs that is required for their proper development 20 . To date , there is no link between these two NRT1 . 1 signalling models . In addition , the mechanisms involved in the NRT1 . 1 - dependent feedback repression of gene expression by high nitrogen remain totally obscure . Using Arabidopsis NRT1 . 1 P492L mutant and genotypes expressing the NRT1 . 1 T101A or NRT1 . 1 T101D mutants in an NRT1 . 1 knockout mutant background 14 , we show here that NRT1 . 1 modulates LRP development and triggers gene feedback regulation by high nitrogen through mechanisms that are indepen - dent of those involved in the PNR , and that the phosphorylated form of NRT1 . 1 also plays a crucial role in NO 3 − signalling and NO 3 − - dependent auxin transport . Results NRT1 . 1 - dependent regulation of lateral root development . The repression exerted by NRT1 . 1 on lateral root development at low external NO 3 − availability is evidenced by the markedly increased lateral root density and length in the chl1 - 5 knockout mutant of NRT1 . 1 compared with the Col wild type ( WT ) in NO 3 − - free medium , whereas this difference is abolished or dramatically reduced on medium containing 1 mM NO 3 − ( Fig . 1a – c ) . We have previously shown that it is NO 3 − per se that modulates the repressive action of NRT1 . 1 , because supply of another nitrogen source such as glutamine does not mimic the effect of NO 3 − ( ref . 19 ) . Both genotypes chl1 - 9 and T101A expressing the NRT1 . 1 P492L mutant ( lacking NO 3 − transport activity 14 ) or the non - phosphorylable NRT1 . 1 T101A mutant displayed a chl1 - 5 phenotype , whereas T101D plants expressing the phosphomimetic NRT1 . 1 T101D mutant showed a WT phenotype ( Fig . 1a – c ) . These results indicate that P492L and T101A but not T101D 1 Biochimie et Physiologie Moléculaire des Plantes , CNRS / INRA / SupAgro - M / UM , Montpellier 34060 , France . 2 Amélioration Génétique et Adaptation des Plantes , CIRAD / INRA / SupAgro - M , Montpellier , France . 3 Institute of Experimental Botany , Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic , v . v . i . , Rozvojová 263 , Prague 6 - Lysolaje 16502 , Czech Republic . * e - mail : gojon @ supagro . inra . fr LETTERS PUBLISHED : 2 MARCH 2015 | ARTICLE NUMBER : 15015 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / NPLANTS . 2015 . 15 NATURE PLANTS | VOL 1 | MARCH 2015 | www . nature . com / natureplants 1 © 201 5 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

NRT1 . 1 T101D transports auxin as the wild - type NRT1 . 1 protein . We have previously proposed that NRT1 . 1 represses LRP emergence through its auxin transport capacity 19 . The identi ﬁ cation of point mutations in NRT1 . 1 that suppress this repression ( such as P492L and T101A , Fig . 1 ) offers an important opportunity to validate this hypothesis . Therefore , the mutated forms of NRT1 . 1 were investigated for their auxin in ﬂ ux activity in Xenopus oocytes using 2 , 4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2 , 4 - D ) as a substrate and a surrogate to indole - 3 - acetic acid ( IAA ) 21 . As reported previously with 3 H - IAA , oocytes injected with WT NRT1 . 1 cRNA displayed a 75 % increase in 3 H - 2 , 4 - D accumulation compared with the control ( Fig . 2a ) . Injection with NRT1 . 1 T101D cRNA yielded the same outcome , but injection with NRT1 . 1 T101A cRNA resulted in a markedly lowered 3 H - 2 , 4 - D accumulation , whereas expression of NRT1 . 1 P492L failed to increase it over that recorded in control oocytes ( Fig . 2a ) . The facts that NRT1 . 1 P492L does not transport auxin and that NRT1 . 1 T101D has a markedly higher auxin transport capacity than NRT1 . 1 T101A were con ﬁ rmed by 3 H - IAA uptake assays in tobacco BY - 2 cell lines stably transformed with the corresponding genes under the control of an oestradiol - inducible promoter ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Therefore , we con ﬁ rm that the mutations preventing or dramatically reducing NRT1 . 1 - mediated auxin transport ( P492L and T101A substitution ) are also those altering NRT1 . 1 - dependent regulation of LRP emergence ( Fig . 1 ) . Furthermore , these data suggest that the P492L substitution not only suppresses transport of NO 3 − by NRT1 . 1 but also transport of auxin , and that it is the phosphorylated form of NRT1 . 1 that is predominantly active in auxin transport . NRT1 . 1 T101D modulates auxin gradient in LRP as wild - type NRT1 . 1 . Next , we investigated the effect of the point mutations on the auxin gradients in LRPs . Indeed , we have previously proposed that NRT1 . 1 represses emergence of LRPs because its auxin transport activity prevents auxin accumulation in these organs , in the absence but not in the presence of NO 3 − ( ref . 19 ) . To further document this point , we introduced the DR5 : : GFP auxin biosensor in the various mutant lines . As expected from the very low auxin transport capacity recorded for NRT1 . 1 P492L and NRT1 . 1 T101A , chl1 - 9 × DR5 : : GFP and T101A × DR5 : : GFP plants behaved like chl1 - 5 × DR5 : : GFP plants and exhibited strongly enhanced DR5 activity ( up to 300 % ) in LRPs compared with WT or T101D backgrounds in the absence , but not in the presence , of NO 3 − ( Fig . 2c ) . Similar results were obtained with independent lines expressing the DR5 : : GUS transgene ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that NRT1 . 1 P492L and NRT1 . 1 T101A mutants are unable to prevent auxin accumulation in LRPs at low NO 3 − , and con ﬁ rm that the effect of NRT1 . 1 on the local auxin gradients in LRPs is associated with , and most probably due to , its auxin transport activity . P492L prevents plasma membrane localization of NRT1 . 1 . Altogether , the above results are all in agreement with the conclusion that , due to its capacity to transport auxin , it is the phosphorylated form of NRT1 . 1 that actually represses LRP development at low NO 3 − by preventing auxin accumulation in these organs . To further understand why both NRT1 . 1 P492L and NRT1 . 1 T101A fail to ful ﬁ l this function , we checked whether P492L and T101A mutations led to lack of expression or mistargetting of the mutant proteins , by expressing oestradiol - inducible C o l c h l 1 - 5 c h l 1 - 9 T 1 0 1 A T 1 0 1 D C o l c h l 1 - 5 c h l 1 - 9 T 1 0 1 A T 1 0 1 D C o l c h l 1 - 5 c h l 1 - 9 T 1 0 1 A T 1 0 1 D T o t a l L R l e n g t h ( c m ) * * * * * * * * * 0 1 2 3 4 5 b L R d e n s i t y ( c m − 1 ) 1 2 3 4 0 L R d e n s i t y ( c m − 1 ) 1 2 3 4 0 DAS 8 9 11 12 10 DAS 8 9 11 12 10 a * * 0 20 10 30 40 50 T o t a l L R l e n g t h ( c m ) c 1 mM NO 3− 1 mM NO 3− 1 mM NO 3− 0 mM NO 3− 0 mM NO 3− 0 mM NO 3− C o l c h l 1 - 5 c h l 1 - 9 T 1 0 1 A T 1 0 1 D Col T101D T101A chl1 - 9 chl1 - 5 Col T101D T101A chl1 - 9 chl1 - 5 Figure 1 | Point mutations in the NRT1 . 1 nitrate transceptor differentially alter the nitrate regulation of lateral root growth .

NRT1 . 1 – mCherry translational fusions in both chl1 - 5 mutant plants and tobacco BY2 cells . All four proteins were expressed in LRPs at a similar level ( Fig . 3a ) . However , unlike the other fusion proteins that were correctly addressed at the plasma membrane , NRT1 . 1 P492L – mCherry displayed a predominant intracellular localization in both root and BY2 cells ( Fig . 3b , c ) . These data provide a relevant explanation for the lack of transport activity recorded for NRT1 . 1 P492L with both NO 3 − and auxin as substrates . They also indicate that reduced auxin transport by NRT1 . 1 T101A is not due to mistargetting , as also suggested by its high NO 3 − transport capacity 22 , but is probably an intrinsic property of the non - phosphorylated form of the protein . NRT1 . 1 - dependent regulation of NRT2 . 1 expression . It has been demonstrated 14 that both NRT1 . 1 T101A and NRT1 . 1 P492L can trigger NRT1 . 1 - dependent short - term induction of NRT2 . 1 expression by NO 3 − ( illustrative of the PNR ) , whereas NRT1 . 1 T101D only activates a restricted response . Most surprisingly , we found that the other aspect of the NRT1 . 1 - dependent regulation of NRT2 . 1 expression , that is its long - term repression under high nitrogen supply , was affected by the point mutations of NRT1 . 1 in a totally different manner ( Fig . 4 ) . As previously shown 13 , 16 , the NRT2 . 1 mRNA level was much higher in the chl1 - 5 knockout mutant than in Col when grown on 10 mM NH 4 NO 3 ( Fig . 4a ) .

In comparison , T101D mutation did not markedly alter this repression and only slightly increased NRT2 . 1 mRNA level over that recorded in WT ( Col ) plants ( Fig . 4a ) . To determine when the shift between induction and later feedback repression of NRT2 . 1 occurs and how point mutations of NRT1 . 1 affect it , we performed time course studies of NRT2 . 1 transcript accumulation following the ﬁ rst supply of NO 3 − at a high concentration ( 10 mM ) . In agreement with a previous study 14 , induction of NRT2 . 1 after 1 h of NO 3 − treatment was stronger in Col , chl1 - 9 and T101A than in chl1 - 5 or T101D ( Fig . 4b ) .

( Fig . 4b ) . This shows that NRT1 . 1 - dependent repression of NRT2 . 1 occurs soon after its initial induction , and that unlike the PNR , it requires the phosphorylated form of NRT1 . 1 . NRT1 . 1 regulation of transcriptome at high nitrogen . The unexpected ﬁ nding that induction and repression of NRT2 . 1 by NRT1 . 1 involves different mechanisms prompted us to get a genome - wide view of the transcriptome reprogramming triggered by the different forms of NRT1 . 1 under high nitrogen repressive conditions ( 10 mM NH 4 NO 3 ) . Three independent experiments were performed with the various genotypes ( including chl1 - 12 , an additional knockout mutant of NRT1 . 1 ) . Statistical analysis highlighted 490 differentially regulated probes corresponding to 468 unambiguous genes ( Supplementary Table 1 , available at http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / query / acc . cgi ? & acc = GSE49437 ) , which could be organized in 21 clusters ( Fig . 5 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Four clusters ( 11 , 16 , 17 and 20 , Fig . 5b ) were selected for further analysis on the basis of their size , expression pattern and over - represented functional categories . Cluster 20 gathers 155 genes that display NRT2 . 1 - like expression , with upregulation in chl1 - 5 , chl1 - 12 , chl1 - 9 and T101A genotypes compared with Col and T101D . Interestingly , the functional categories that are found to be enriched in this cluster relate to transport in general and to nitrogen , sulphur and selenium metabolisms ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . In particular , several nitrogen transport or assimilation genes , known to be nitrogen - regulated , such as NRT1 . 7 , NRT2 . 4 , DUR3 and GNL1 . 4 , belong to this cluster . Clusters 11 and 16 gather 135 genes that show a pattern of expression that is the opposite of NRT2 . 1 , with downregulation in chl1 - 5 , chl1 - 12 , chl1 - 9 and T101A genotypes compared with Col and T101D ( Fig . 5b ) . a b Cl 5 Cl 6 Cl 17 Cl 4 Cl 9 Cl 18 Cl 12 Cl 1 Cl 15 Cl 7 Cl 20 Cl 3 Cl 21 Cl 13 Cl 2 Cl 8 Cl 11 Cl 16 Cl 19 Cl 10 Cl 14 Cluster 20 Cluster 11 Cluster 17 Cluster 16 1 2 3 −1 −2 −3 1 2 3 −1 −2 −3 1 2 3 −1 −2 −3 1 2 3 155 Genes 55 Genes 80 Genes 54 Genes −1 −2 −3 L o g no r m a l i z e d e x p r e ss i on L o g no r m a l i z e d e x p r e ss i on L o g no r m a l i z e d e x p r e ss i on L o g no r m a l i z e d e x p r e ss i on C o l c h l 1 - 5 c h l 1 - 9 c h l 1 - 1 2 T 1 0 1 A T 1 0 1 D C o l c h l 1 - 5 c h l 1 - 9 c h l 1 - 1 2 T 1 0 1 A T 1 0 1 D Figure 5 | Point mutations in the NRT1 . 1 nitrate transceptor affect different genome - wide responses to high nitrogen provision .

Like cluster 20 , clusters 11 and 16 show an over - representation of the transport functional category , but also in genes associated with environment interactions ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Note that the NO 3 − - inducible transcription factor gene LBD39 , known to be a repressor of NRT2 . 1 expression 23 , was found in cluster 11 . Finally , cluster 17 ( 54 genes ) is striking because it displays an over - representation of genes related to extracellular matrix and secreted proteins as well as genes associated with oxydo - reduction reactions ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , and also because the pattern of expression has never been reported before , as it appears to correspond to a repressive effect of NRT1 . 1 that cannot be phenocopied by either NRT1 . 1 T101A or NRT1 . 1 T101D mutants . As such , this reveals a new role for NRT1 . 1 in the control of gene expression . Cluster 13 may also be representative of this role of NRT1 . 1 as it shows an expression pattern that is the opposite of cluster 17 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . We next investigated whether the main types of responses illus - trated by the clusters shown in Fig . 5b could be associated with already known functions of NRT1 . 1 ( for example regulator of NO 3 − - responsive genes or auxin transport facilitator ) . Therefore , we quanti ﬁ ed the overlap between clusters 11 , 13 , 16 , 17 and 20 and transcriptome datasets reporting either the NO 3 − response in WT and nitrate reductase - null mutants 24 , or the response to auxin 25 . Not unexpectedly , clusters 11 , 16 and 20 , which illustrate the same regulation behaviour ( that is NRT1 . 1 - dependent regu - lation phenocopied only by NRT1 . 1 T101D ) , display in common a highly signi ﬁ cant overlap with the subsets of genes responding to NO 3 − , either in WT or NR - null mutants ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . Clusters 16 and 20 also show a signi ﬁ cant overlap with the gene subset responding to auxin ( the overlap is slightly above signi ﬁ cance level for cluster 11 ) . These data indicate that clusters 11 , 16 and 20 are over - represented in genes regulated by signalling pathways known to be activated by NRT1 . 1 . In contrast , clusters 13 and 17 , illustrative of a totally different regulatory ‘ mode ’ ( that is NRT1 . 1 - dependent regulation not phenocopied by either NRT1 . 1 T101A or NRT1 . 1 T101D mutation ) , show no overlap with NO 3 − - responsive genes , and no ( cluster 13 ) or only a very weak overlap ( cluster 17 ) with the gene subset regulated by auxin ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . This suggests that NRT1 . 1 acts on these two clusters through signalling mechanisms different from those described previously . Discussion In this work , we considered three different responses of the plant to NO 3 − that are dependent on NRT1 . 1 but occur under different experimental conditions : ( 1 ) the repression of lateral root develop - ment at low NO 3 − availability ( Fig . 1 ) , ( 2 ) the short - term induction of NRT2 . 1 ( Fig . 4b ) that is representative of the PNR 14 , and ( 3 ) the regulation of gene expression by high nitrogen that occurs in the longer term ( Figs 4 and 5 ) . Analysis of these responses in the various NRT1 . 1 point mutants unravels four different ‘ modes ’ of NRT1 . 1 - dependent signalling ( Fig . 6 ) . Our data agree with those c d Repression of lateral root emergence at low NO 3− Induction of genes of cluster 17 at high N a b Primary NO 3− response at high NO 3− NRT2 . 1 Feedback repression of NRT2 . 1 and genes of cluster 20 at high N NO 3− NO 3− NO 3− NRT2 . 1 Auxin Auxin Auxin Cluster 17 Auxin Cluster 20 NO 3− PM NRT1 . 1 WT NO 3− ?

Furthermore , the long - term regulation of NRT2 . 1 expression and of genes of clusters 20 , 11 and 16 by high nitrogen ( Fig . 6b ) , and the repression of lateral root emergence in the absence of NO 3 − ( Fig . 6c ) show the opposite pattern , with little or no effect of T101D substitution , and loss of sig - nalling resulting from P492L or T101A mutations . Finally , clusters 13 and 17 ( > 60 genes ) , are under NRT1 . 1 - dependent regulation that is suppressed by both T101A and T101D mutations , but not by P492L , indicating a yet uncharacterized signalling role of NRT1 . 1 ( Fig . 6d ) . The unexpected ﬁ nding that P492L mutation prevents normal traf ﬁ cking of NRT1 . 1 , without affecting two of these regulatory ‘ modes ’ ( PNR and regulation of the genes of clusters 13 and 17 ) , suggests that NO 3 − signalling by NRT1 . 1 can partly occur indepen - dently of its localization and transport function at the plasma mem - brane . However , mistargetting of NRT1 . 1 due to P492L mutation raises the question of whether this substitution actually affects the intrinsic NO 3 − transport capacity of the protein . This point is important because apparent loss of NO 3 − transport by NRT1 . 1 P492L was taken as evidence that transport and signalling functions of NRT1 . 1 can be uncoupled 14 , thus supporting the trans - ceptor model for this protein . Nevertheless , it is conceivable from our data that NRT1 . 1 P492L can still transport NO 3 − , but that this ability does not lead to NO 3 − uptake into the cell , because NRT1 . 1 P492L is not at the plasma membrane . In our opinion , these considerations are not suf ﬁ cient to reject the transceptor model for NRT1 . 1 , for at least two reasons . First , although nothing demonstrates that P492L supresses NO 3 − transport activity of NRT1 . 1 , structural studies on this protein 26 , 27 provide some support for this hypothesis . Indeed , although P492 is not part of the NO 3 − recognition site , it is located in the short loop separating transmembrane domains 10 and 11 . Therefore , its mutation is expected to alter the structural coordination of these two domains 26 , and consequently the three - dimensional position of the E476 residue of transmembrane domain 10 , which is crucial for the NO 3 − transport mechanism 27 . Second , P492L is not the only point mutation reported to uncouple transport and signalling functions of NRT1 . 1 . Our own data ( Fig . 6 ) and others 7 show that T101A substitution results in loss of NRT1 . 1 - dependent NO 3 − sig - nalling , although it does not prevent NO 3 − transport by NRT1 . 1 22 . The results obtained with the various mutants are fully consistent with our previous proposal that NRT1 . 1 regulates lateral root devel - opment through its auxin transport capacity 19 . Accordingly , point mutations of NRT1 . 1 that suppress or inhibit its auxin transport facilitation ( P492L and T101A ) ( Fig . 2a , b ) are also those leading to a misregulation of both DR5 activity in LRPs ( Fig . 2c ) and emer - gence of LRPs in response to NO 3 − limitation ( Fig . 1 ) . Although it does not constitute a ﬁ nal proof , we believe this correlative evidence provides strong support for our proposal . In contrast , the mechan - ism involved in the NRT1 . 1 - dependent long - term response to high nitrogen provision remains obscure , and there are no clues indicat - ing that it is associated with the NO 3 − / auxin transport function of NRT1 . 1 , or not . However , there is circumstantial evidence that the feedback repression of NRT2 . 1 may be because NRT1 . 1 acts as an inducer of LBD39 , a previously identi ﬁ ed negative regulator of NRT2 . 1 expression 23 . Accordingly , GLN1 . 4 , which is also under negative control by LBD39 ( ref . 23 ) is repressed by NRT1 . 1 in the same way as NRT2 . 1 is . The validation of this hypothesis will never - theless require further investigation . Note that T101A and T101D mutations ( that suppress and mimic T101 phosphorylation , respectively ) inhibit different NRT1 . 1 - dependent signalling responses ( Fig . 6 ) . This suggests that phosphorylated and non - phosphorylated forms of NRT1 . 1 have separate signalling roles . Previous studies have highlighted the crucial impact of T101 phosphorylation for switching between the high - and the low - af ﬁ nity modes of the protein for NO 3 − trans - port 22 . Very recently , crystal structure studies have revealed that T101 phosphorylation controls dimerization and / or structural ﬂ exi - bility of NRT1 . 1 26 , 27 . Here , we show that T101 phosphorylation also directs the action of NRT1 . 1 towards the activation of speci ﬁ c responses ( lateral root development and feedback regulation by high nitrogen ) , pointing out a crucial signalling function of the phosphorylated form of the protein ( Fig . 6 ) . The fact that neither NRT1 . 1 T101A nor NRT1 . 1 T101D can ensure the NRT1 . 1 - dependent regulation of clusters 13 and 17 may appear highly surprising . However , several hypotheses may explain this observation . For instance , this regulation may be directly associated with the dynamic processes of phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of the T101 residue that are impaired by both T101A and T101D mutations . Alternatively , as NRT1 . 1 forms a dimer 27 , it is theoreti - cally possible that genes of clusters 13 and 17 are responsive to sig - nalling by an NRT1 . 1 dimer with only one subunit phosphorylated , a structure that cannot be mimicked in T101A or T101D plants . In conclusion , our work suggests that the wide range of responses to NO 3 − triggered by NRT1 . 1 may relate to different NO 3 − transduc - tion mechanisms at the level of the NRT1 . 1 protein itself that can be separated by speci ﬁ c point mutations . This provides a generalization of observations made on transceptors in yeast 28 . For instance , the NH 4 + transceptor Mep2 was reported to mediate two different signalling mechanisms , namely activation of the protein kinase A signalling pathway upon high NH 4 + supply 29 , and initiation of the so - called pseudo - hyphal growth in response to NH 4 + limitation 30 . These two responses were uncoupled by point mutations in the protein that prevented pseudo - hyphal growth without affecting PKA activation 29 . Therefore , our work suggests that plants , like yeast , have developed versatile transceptors with multiple sensing / transduction mechanisms , able to activate independent responses , depending on the environmental conditions . Material and Methods Plant material . The Arabidopsis thaliana accession used was Columbia ( Col - 0 ) .
