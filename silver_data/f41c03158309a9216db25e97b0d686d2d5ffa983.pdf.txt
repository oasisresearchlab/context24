Abstract — Mechanical ventilation is necessary for treatment of the acute respiratory distress syndrome but leads to overdistension of the open regions of the lung and produces further damage . Although we know that the excessive stresses and strains disrupt the alveolar epithelium , we know little about the relationship between epithelial strain and epithelial leak . We have developed a computational model of an epithelial monolayer to simulate leak progression due to overdistension and to explain previous experimental ﬁndings in mice with ventilator - induced lung injury . We found a nonlinear threshold - type relationship between leak area and increasing stretch force . After the force required to initiate the leak was reached , the leak area increased at a constant rate with further increases in force . Furthermore , this rate was slower than the rate of increase in force , especially at end - expiration . Parameter manipulation changed only the leak - initiating force ; leak area growth followed the same trend once this force was surpassed . These results suggest that there is a particular force ( analogous to ventilation tidal volume ) that must not be exceeded to avoid damage and that changing cell physical properties adjusts this threshold . This is relevant for the development of new ventilator strategies that avoid inducing further injury to the lung . Keywords — Lung injury , Alveolar stretch , Spring network model . INTRODUCTION Overdistension of the lungs during mechanical ventilation is presumed to be one of the key mecha - nisms in the production of ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) . 23 , 24 The damage this causes to the lung tissues is known as volutrauma and is readily avoided in a normal lung simply by keeping tidal volume in the normal range . 4 However , a signiﬁcant fraction of the parenchyma can become derecruited in lungs that are already injured , in which case the entire delivered tidal volume is forced into the remaining open fraction . 36 This is presumed to overdistend the open regions and cause volutrauma by a mechanism that would appear to be straightforward ; excessive strain breaks the nor - mally intact epithelial barrier allowing edematous material that has accumulated in the interstitium to leak into the airspaces . This disrupts surfactant func - tion to increase surface tension and thus cause even greater stresses on the parenchymal tissues . The result is a vicious circle that can spiral out of control . 29 Although this scenario might seem rather obvious in general terms , we currently know little about its de - tails . We do have evidence , however , that these details might be somewhat complex ; the epithelial leak in a mouse model of VILI appears to be related to tidal volume in a very nonlinear fashion for reasons that remain mechanistically obscure . 30 Understanding the details of how epithelial strain leads to epithelial leak is crucial , however , not only for developing ventilator strategies that avoid volutrauma but also for knowing what constraints on strategy are imposed once damage to the epithelial barrier has occurred . Accordingly , in the present study we developed a computational model of the airway epithelium for the purposes of studying how the initiation of a leak through the epithelial barrier is linked to epithelial strain , and how the leak worsens with increasing strain . We hypothesized that the stress released by the formation of a leak would protect a sheet of epithelial cells from further damage in the presence of increased strain . We used the model to help us establish a mechanistic basis for our previous experimental ﬁndings in mice with VILI . 30 METHODS Hexagonal Cell Model We model an alveolar epithelial cell monolayer as an approximately square two - dimensional assembly of Address correspondence to Jason H .

The boundary of each cell in its baseline conﬁguration consists of six linear segments , with horizontal segments of length h and diagonal segments of length h ﬃﬃﬃ 3 p = 2 to reduce the vertical dimension so the network is approximately square . Junctions con - nect three adjacent cells together at each hexagonal corner and connect two adjacent cells midway along each hexagonal edge , as shown in Fig . 1 . The internal cytoskeleton of each cell is represented by a network of springs that connect each of the 12 cell – cell junction points on the cell boundary to 3 of the 12 internal nodes located 65 % of the distance along the line from the cell center to each cell – cell junction point ( Fig . 1 ) . This placement produces a higher density of shorter springs around the hexagon borders , analogous to the submembranous cortical cytoskeleton of alveolar epithelial cells . 13 , 17 Additionally , this arrangement resulted in the best numerical stability of the model when we solved for its elastic equilibrium conﬁguration over the range of stretch forces we investigated . The node at the cell center connects to each of these 12 internal nodes which themselves are connected to each other to form an internal hexagon . The relationship between force ( F ) and length ( x ) of each cytoskeletal spring is linear according to F ¼ k x (cid:2) x 0 ð Þ ; ð 1 Þ where k is a spring constant and x 0 is the resting spring length ( 90 % of the length in the baseline construction of the model ) . Because the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane must have some ﬁnite stiffness , we modeled the boundaries of each cell between adjacent junction points as springs via Eq . ( 1 ) with stiffness set to 0 . 01 k . This accounts for the likelihood that the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane is much less stiff than the actin ﬁlaments comprising the cytoskeleton . Also , we found this choice of stiffness for the cell membrane to provide numerical stability for the solution of the model’s equilibrium conﬁguration . We note that in this two - dimensional model we are not explicitly accounting for the attachment of the epithelial cell monolayer to its basement membrane substrate , which may imbue the layer with additional mechanical resilience against tearing . However , we can assume in the model that this extra resilience is subsumed in some of the strength of the cell – cell junctions . Computational Method We developed custom software based on the ﬁnite element method , adapted from our previously de - scribed model of airway - parenchymal interdepen - dence , 18 – 21 that solves a system of force equilibrium equations for a planar spring network . 40 Each spring was assumed to be a bar element with baseline length x 0 . The springs were connected by a hinge at each node F s F s Network Boundary ( Fixed after Stretch ) Leak Boundary & Failed Junction Inner Springs & Nodes Cell Borders & Cell – Cell Junctions ( a ) ( b ) h 0 . 65 h FIGURE 1 . Conﬁguration of hexagonal network . ( a ) The outer boundary is ﬁxed after the network is stretched biaxially with force F s . Each cell contains a network of springs connecting inner nodes to cell – cell junctions . ( b ) The junctions on the cell borders can separate to form leaks between the cells if the resultant force from the attached springs in one cell exceeds the threshold value for that node . H AMLINGTON et al . 152 to allow free rotation . The spring network was stret - ched biaxially by applying a force F s to each of the nodes lying along the right and top boundaries , leaving the left and bottom boundary nodes ﬁxed . Fixing the left and bottom boundary nodes merely establishes a coordinate system ﬁxed to these boundaries to facili - tate the simulations , and the actual stretching of the network is uniform and biaxial when the right and upper boundary nodes are moved . Given the applied F s on the boundary nodes , we solved for the node displacements with the global matrix equation KX ¼ B ; ð 2 Þ where K , X , and B are the stiffness , displacement , and force matrices , respectively . The boundary nodes were ﬁxed at their new positions for the rest of the simula - tion . The elastic equilibrium conﬁguration of the internal spring network was computed using a suc - cessive over - relaxation procedure . 5 For each iteration , the forces at each internal node were computed , mul - tiplied by an adaptively adjusted relaxation factor , and used to solve for the internal node displacements ( Eq . 2 ) . This process was repeated until all inner node forces were less than a tolerance value set to 10 (cid:2) 5 . At this point , the spring network was assumed to have reached elastic equilibrium . To form a leak in the network due to the applied F s , we assigned to each internal cell – cell junction on hexagon borders a force threshold F t above which it would fail . With the stretched network in its equilib - rium conﬁguration after applying F s to the boundary nodes , we computed the resultant pulling forces at each internal cell – cell junction from the forces in the springs attached to it in each adjacent hexagonal cell . If a node had a pulling force that exceeded its value of F t , then that node would split into two nodes . This was accomplished by adding an additional node and con - necting springs at the location of the failed node and then solving for the new equilibrium conﬁguration of the network using the iterative procedure just de - scribed to compute the new pulling forces . This allowed the opposing cells to move apart from each other under the inﬂuence of their respective elastic elements , which created a leak between the hexagonal cells as illustrated in Fig . 1b . The leak formation due to F s was an iterative process in which the node with the largest pulling force greater than its F t was allowed to fail ﬁrst while all other nodes remained intact , a new equilibrium conﬁguration was computed , and then the next node with the largest excess force would fail fol - lowed by the equilibrium computation , and so on . This process was repeated until no junctions remained with pulling forces greater than their F t . We counted the number of leaks and computed the total leak area formed by the separated cell edges due to the initially applied F s at this point in the computation to deﬁne the epithelial leak in the stretched state analogous to end - inspiration . To determine the leak at end - expiration , we then incrementally moved the network boundary back to its baseline ( pre - stretch ) position by computing the new equilibrium conﬁguration of the spring net - work after each adjustment and calculated the leak area again when this process was complete . Scaling Parameters To relate this spring network model to an alveolar epithelial monolayer , consider that the surface area of the epithelium covering each human alveolus is around 220 , 000 l m . 2 , 37 In our baseline case , we modeled this as an assembly of N = 45 hexagons each with an edge length of h = 1 . To achieve the surface area of one alveolus , the dimensional value of the hexagon edge must be 43 . 4 l m , which served as our reference length scale in the model . We simulated networks with N = 22 , 45 , 67 , 104 , 149 , 202 , and 246 hexagons , yielding dimensional surface areas ranging from 107 , 659 to 1 , 203 , 833 l m 2 and representing monolayers that cover between half of an alveolus and ﬁve and one half alveoli . We also simulated 45 - cell networks with smaller and larger h values ( ± 10 , ± 25 , and ± 50 % ) , which reduced or increased the cell size ( dimensional edge lengths 21 . 7 – 65 . 1 l m ) and thus the network sur - face area ( 55 , 053 – 495 , 480 l m 2 ) . We computed the epithelial leak for a range of dimensionless stretch force magnitudes , 0 . 001 £ F s £ 0 . 1 , to determine the dependence of the leak area on the stretch applied to the network at both end - inspira - tion and end - expiration . The maximum F s corresponds to a strain of 30 % , deﬁned as the % change in network area from its initial ( unstretched ) state . In order to relate the parameters F s , F t , and k to dimensional values , we computed a reference force scale f based on Young’s modulus , E , of an alveolar epithelial cell , which has been measured with atomic - force microscopy to be around 1 – 5 kPa for human A549 cells in a conﬂuent mono - layer . 2 , 15 , 27 For this model , we assumed E = 1 kPa for the entire spring network . We simulated horizontal stretch of the 45 - cell network and used the stress – strain relation E = r / e , where r = f F s / A I ( the applied force adjusted by the scaling force divided by the initial cross - sectional area over which the force is applied ) and e = D L / L 0 ( the linear displacement of the network due to the force relative to its initial length ) , to compute the scaling force f for F s that yielded E = 1 kPa . In approximating A I , we assumed the height of the cell monolayer to be 5 l m . 36 This resulted in f = 118 nN ; thus the simulations covered the range 0 . 118 – 11 . 8 nN . Modeling Epithelial Leak 153 We used a node force threshold F t = 0 . 2 for the base - line case , equivalent to 23 . 6 nN using the force scaling factor . The spring stiffness constant was k = 1 for the baseline case so that a force of 1 generated an extension of 1 . Stiffness is a force per length , so the stiffness of the individual springs in the model corresponds to 2 . 7 nN / l m by dividing the force scale by the length scale . Al - though it can be helpful to relate the system to dimen - sional values , we note that it is difﬁcult to translate the values generated by this simpliﬁed model to a human system ; rather , the utility of the model lies in the interpretation of the behavior in response to the parameters . We investigated the eﬀects of modifying F t and k by ± 10 , ± 25 , and ± 50 % of their baseline values in the 45 - cell model ( F t = 11 . 8 – 35 . 4 nN , E = 0 . 5 – 1 . 5 kPa ) . To test the effects of inhomogeneity among the cells in the network the value of k for each internal spring was drawn from a normal distribution with mean l k = 1 and standard deviation r k = 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , and 0 . 15 . Each junction’s F t was chosen from a normal distribution with mean l Ft = 0 . 2 and standard deviation r Ft = 0 . 01 , 0 . 02 , and 0 . 03 . For the simulations with variation in k and F t we completed 50 computations for each F s and report the mean and standard devia - tion of the results . The same 50 conﬁgurations of k and F t were used to span F s . All simulations were carried out in MATLAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) on a regular desktop computer . RESULTS Leak Propagation In Fig . 2 , we show the 45 - cell network subjected to a biaxial stretch force of F s = 0 . 07 at several points during the progression of the cell – cell junction failures . Each panel shows the leak after the number of nodes indicated ( nf ) have failed ; 63 nodes in the network failed as a result of the applied F s ( Fig . 2f ) . The inner springs and nodes are not shown for clarity . Instead , the cells are shaded based on the maximum spring force magnitude within that cell . In this conﬁguration of the model with k = 1 , F t = 0 . 2 , and h = 1 , the ﬁrst node to fail is a corner junction between three cells . Leaks at two corners then coalesce into a single leak ( a ) nf = 9 ( b ) nf = 10 ( c ) nf = 30 ( e ) nf = 53 ( d ) nf = 35 ( f ) nf = 63 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 25 0 . 3 Maximum Spring Force in Cell 0 . 02 0 . 34 FIGURE 2 . Leak progression in the 45 - cell network . The panels ( a – f ) show how the leak caused by the applied stretch force F s = 0 . 07 forms . Only one node fails at a time ; nf indicates how many nodes have failed in each panel . The shading represents the value of the maximum spring force within each cell . Spring stiffness k = 1 , force threshold F t = 0 . 2 , and cell edge length h = 1 . H AMLINGTON et al . 154 when the node between the leaks fails ( Figs . 2a and 2b ) . A leak will also grow by adjacent node failures until the outer boundary of the network is reached ( Figs . 2c – 2e ) . Because the outer network boundary is not allowed to fail , the sheet of cells cannot completely detach into multiple segments . However , the leak can divide the sheet into sections attached only by the outer boundary . The forces of the internal springs are smaller in the cells bordering the leak because these cells are no longer bounded on one side by other cells and have thus returned close to their original pre - stretched states . Conceptually , the force in a spring is zero if its displacement is zero following Eq . ( 1 ) . Cell shape thus depends on the spring forces resulting from both the applied F s and the leak that forms . The ﬁnal leak area in Fig . 2f relative to the area of the network in its baseline conﬁguration is 0 . 33 . A movie of this leak progression can be found in the Supplementary Material . The behavior of the leak progression in networks with larger N is similar . Behavior with Increasing N and F s Figure 3 ( a ) shows the leak area , A leak , normalized by the total network area before stretching and junc - tion failure , A 0 , for N = 22 , 45 , 67 , 104 , 149 , 202 , and 246 at end - inspiration and end - expiration with increasing F s ( k = 1 , F t = 0 . 2 , h = 1 ) . We see that A leak / A 0 sharply increases from zero between F s = 0 . 028 and F s = 0 . 0285 . F s at onset decreases as N increases . After the onset of leak , A leak / A 0 increases linearly with F s in the network at end - inspiration , but at end - expiration A leak / A 0 plateaus at a near - constant value as F s increases . In both cases , once the leak be - gins A leak / A 0 vs . F s appears to converge with increasing N to a solution in which A leak / A 0 increases with F s at a constant rate at end - inspiration but maintains a con - stant value at end - expiration . We see in Fig . 3b that the number of failed junc - tions becomes increasingly constant as F s increases after leak onset with increasing N , mirroring the con - stant slope / constant value convergence behavior of A leak / A 0 . The ﬁnal number of leaks in the network with increasing F s is shown in Fig . 3c for each N . In general , for most N one large leak forms at lower F s , additional smaller leaks form as F s increases , and then the smaller leaks merge with the large leak so that the total num - ber of leaks formed is reduced at higher F s . As N increases , the highest number of leaks occurs at lower F s , leaving one large leak at higher F s . Sensitivity to Parameters k , F t , and h We changed k , F t , and h by ± 10 , ± 25 , and ± 50 % of the baseline values in the 45 - cell network ; the A leak / A 0 vs . F s curves for the ± 10 % cases are shown in Fig . 4a . The curves are the same for k and h because A leak is scaled by A 0 . By Eq . ( 1 ) , force scales with k for the same displacement , and force scales with displacement for the same k . The spring network acts in a similar way such that changing k or h alters the internal node 0 A l ea k / A 0 End - Inspiration End - Expiration ( a ) 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 22 cells 45 cells 67 cells 104 cells 149 cells 202 cells 246 cells 0 50 100 150 200 J un c t i on F a il u r e s ( b ) 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 F s 1 6 Number of Leaks C e ll s i n N e t w o r k 246 202 149 104 67 45 22 ( c ) 2 4 3 5 FIGURE 3 .

Modeling Epithelial Leak 155 forces , making them higher or lower with respect to their F t than they might have been at baseline , and shifts the applied F s that causes leak . Increasing k or h decreases the minimum F s that causes leak formation ( curve shifts to left ) , while decreasing k or h shifts the curve to the right . Conversely , increasing F t increases the minimum F s that causes leak formation ( curve shifts to right ) , while decreasing F t shifts the curve to the left . Adjustments of ± 25 and ± 50 % in k , h , and F t followed the same trend , with larger changes to F s at leak onset . We note that for a 50 % decrease in F t and a 50 % increase in k or h , all values of F s form a leak ( no threshold ) . F t has a greater effect on the F s at leak onset than k and h , as can be seen in Fig . 4b , which shows the change in F s at leak onset from the baseline case for all parameter changes . We note that in the cases where F t was decreased or k or h were increased ( all of which decrease F s at leak onset ) , the leak area at the lowest F s values makes several jumps instead of just one before increasing more steadily with F s ( Fig . 4a ) . In this region of leak onset , three or four smaller leaks formed instead of one large leak , as happened in all other cases . At end - inspiration A leak / A 0 is lower relative to the baseline case at a given F s for increased k , h , and F t and higher for decreased k , h , and F t . Stiffer or longer springs increase the spring forces , which makes the network harder to stretch ( less area strain ) and reduces the area of the leak . At the same time , the increase in spring forces increases node forces , and thus node failure and leak formation , at lower F s . Increasing ( or decreasing ) the strength of the junctions also reduces ( or increases ) the leak area . This behavior can be condensed into a single curve by plotting the results on scaled axes , as shown in Fig . 4c . The horizontal axis is F spring / F t , where F spring is the maximum spring force computed with Eq . ( 1 ) after the network is stretched but before node failures , and is dependent on the as - signed values of k and h . The left - hand vertical axis is A leak kh / A 0 F t , which accounts for the change in leak area with adjustment of k , h , and F t . At end - expiration all curves approach the baseline curve as F s increases ( Fig . 4a ) . This is plotted in Fig . 4c with the horizontal axis F spring / F t but with respect to A leak / A 0 on the right - hand vertical axis . The parameters k , h , and F t did not affect A leak / A 0 at end - expiration . Inhomogeneous Distributions of k and F t In the 45 - cell network , assigning inhomogeneous distributions of k and F t decreased the minimum F s at which the leak began compared to the baseline uniform case ( F s = 0 . 0282 ) . The mean and standard deviation of this value ( n = 50 ) is shown in Fig . 5 for r k = 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , and 0 . 15 and r Ft = 0 . 01 , 0 . 02 , and 0 . 03 ( 5 , 10 , and 15 % of l k and l Ft ) , applied separately and together ( l k = 1 , l Ft = 0 . 2 , and h = 1 in all cases ) .

H AMLINGTON et al . 156 increasing r k , which agrees with the previous result showing that changing F t has a larger effect on F s at leak onset than changing k . From a multiple compar - ison test using one - way ANOVA , all means of F s at leak onset are signiﬁcantly different ( p £ 0 . 014 ) from each other and from the baseline case with two exceptions : there is no difference between the cases [ r k = 0 , r Ft = 0 . 01 ] and [ r k = 0 . 05 , r Ft = 0 . 01 ] or between the cases [ r k = 0 , r Ft = 0 . 03 ] and [ r k = 0 . 15 , r Ft = 0 . 03 ] . In Fig . 6a , the mean A leak / A 0 vs . F s curves at end - inspiration with both r k and r Ft set at 5 , 10 , and 15 % of l k and l Ft , respectively , are shown with their cor - responding standard deviation bounds . Increasing parameter variability lowers the threshold for leak initiation and increases the threshold variability , likely because this increases the probability that some cell – cell junctions will have very low yield stresses . How - ever , the point at which leak area assumes a linear relationship with F s is not greatly changed by vari - ability , so variability merely makes the rise from zero to the linear region more gradual . Increasing the de - gree of variation in F t and k increases the mean num - ber of leaks that form at leak onset compared to the baseline case computed with uniform F t and k , as shown in Fig . 6b . This is true at higher values of F s as well , even though the total leak area is very similar between cases in this region . The inhomogeneity of the parameters thus allows leaks to begin more easily in different regions of the model and to grow indepen - dently with less likelihood of eventually coalescing into a smaller number of larger leaks . DISCUSSION We have developed a computational model that can help explain how epithelial strain caused by overdis - tension during mechanical ventilation leads to epithe - lial leak and VILI . By applying a stretch force to a sheet of hexagons representing epithelial cells , we modeled the progression of leak between the cells and examined how the leak changed with increased force . We found that if a large enough stretch was applied to the network boundary , a leak transecting the sheet from the outer edges would form . This leak resulted from the coalescence of smaller leaks that started at hexagon corners and then grew progressively due to adjacent node failures ( Fig . 2 ) .

Similar threshold behavior has been observed during in vitro cell stretching ; for example , Tschumperlin et al . found a nonlinear relationship between cell death and equibi - axial deformation magnitude in 5 - day alveolar type II cells , which they suggested were representative of pri - mary culture alveolar type I cells and the alveolar blood - gas barrier . 33 , 34 In further studies of alveolar epithelial stretch , the Margulies group found that a threshold strain magnitude of 37 % change in surface area ( corresponding to a tidal volume of 100 % total lung capacity ) disrupted tight junctions and increased epithelial barrier permeability . 7 – 9 In vivo , Gajic et al . showed a much greater degree of alveolar cell injury in rats mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 40 mL / kg than with a tidal volume of 30 mL / kg . 14 In the baseline case , the model showed initiation of leak with an applied force of 0 . 0282 resulting in 7 . 8 % area strain ( 3 . 8 % linear strain ) . Assuming E = 1 kPa for the network and a linear stress – strain relationship , the stress on the cell sheet causing leak is 38 Pa . We note that E = 1 kPa is the value measured for a single alveolar epithelial cell , not an epithelial cell monolayer . Dassow et al . measured E for a layer of human A549 alveolar epithelial cells to be 40 kPa , 10 which would increase the leak - causing stress to 1 . 5 kPa . While these values are difﬁcult to interpret because such measure - ments of alveolar strain and stress during the progres - sion of VILI in humans have not been obtained , a study of lung stress and strain during mechanical ventilation in pigs found surprisingly similar results . 26 The inves - tigators showed a threshold of strain that caused leak ( as measured by increase in lung weight ) that corre - sponded to a stress of around 10 cm H 2 O ( 980 Pa ) . We hypothesized that the stress released by the formation of a leak would protect the sheet of epithelial cells from further damage with increased strain . In support of this hypothesis we found that once the force was large enough for a leak to form , leak area at end - inspiration increased with force in a linear fashion with a positive intercept on the leak area axis ( Fig . 3a ) . In other words , the leak area increased more slowly than the applied force . This effect was even more pronounced at end - expiration where leak area was virtually independent of force after the initial leak - inducing force was exceeded ( Fig . 3a ) . The num - ber of node failures and leaks also did not increase as rapidly as the applied force ( Figs . 3b and 3c ) . These relationships held for different values of N , k , F t , and h and with non - uniform distributions of k and F t . The springs in cells adjacent to the leak approached their initial length , yielding near - zero or zero force in those springs , while the forces in the cells forming the net - work boundaries were larger because these outer boundaries were ﬁxed . The main eﬀect of changing the parameters was the adjustment of the force necessary to initiate the leak ( Fig . 4a ) . Decreasing k and h and increasing F t increased the amount of force or strain required to cause damage to the cells , which indicates the impor - tance of reducing the stiffness of the cells and strengthening the cell – cell junctions to prevent the onset of injury . Indeed , in vitro studies by Yalcin et al . have shown that ‘‘ﬂuidization’’ of the cytoskeleton reduces injury to the epithelial cells during airway reopening . 39 However , reducing k or h also increased the leak area at end - inspiration because less stiff cells are easier to stretch , which leads to a greater strain in the network . Thus , if damage has already occurred , increasing the threshold at which the cell – cell junctions break is more important than reducing k or h . In relation to VILI , this indicates that there is a threshold tidal volume ( proportional to the stretch force dis - cussed here ) that must not be exceeded during venti - lation if further injury to the epithelial barrier is to be prevented . This threshold might vary throughout the injured lung , however , as inhomogeneity increases with derecruitment , which could shrink and lower the range of safe tidal volumes . Importantly , when the plots of leak area vs . force are scaled by a non - dimensional parameter , they all coalesce onto single master curves for both end - inspiration and end - expiration ( Fig . 4c ) , which strongly supports the generality of our ﬁndings . The force needed to initiate leak was highly variable in the case of inhomogeneous k and F t and caused the mean damaging force to be reduced ( Fig . 5 ) . However , after the ﬁrst damaging force was exceeded , the net - work did not experience a greater amount of damage in terms of increased leak area with larger forces ( Fig . 6a ) , although the total number of leaks varied greatly ( Fig . 6b ) . Increasing inhomogeneity in the distributions of k and F t decreased the threshold for leak initiation , but decreasing l k or increasing l Ft will increase this threshold , according to Fig . 4b . For example , to increase F s at leak onset with 10 % vari - ability in l k and l Ft , l k should be increased by about 25 % . Greater change in l k and / or l Ft is required to achieve this with a greater degree of inhomogeneity in the distributions of k and F t . Presumably , an inter - vention that decreases mean cell stiffness , strengthens cell – cell junctions , or reduces the degree of inhomo - geneity in these properties in an inhomogeneous lung could raise the force threshold below which no leaks form and thus be protective against VILI . Leak number also varied over diﬀerent network si - zes ( Fig . 3c ) . In the networks with smaller N , the number of leaks increased with stretch force , but the opposite occurred in larger networks . The converging behavior of the leak area and leak number with increased N suggests that in the case of a sheet with an H AMLINGTON et al . 158 inﬁnite number of cells , a particular stretch force causes a single leak to form that increases with a constant slope at end - inspiration but remains the same size at end - expiration as the stretch force increases . We note , however , that our model of the epithelial monolayer with a ﬁnite number of cells and ﬁxed outer boundary is likely more physiologically representative of an alveolus and the ﬁbrous alveolar duct than an inﬁnite sheet of cells . The ﬁndings from this study are relevant to our pre - vious experimental ﬁndings in a mouse model of VILI . 30 In those experiments , anesthetized and paralyzed BALB / c mice were mechanically ventilated at high tidal volume and zero positive end - expiratory pressure for up to four hours to induce VILI . We assessed the dere - cruitability of the lung by measuring the rate at which lung elastance increased during regular ( low tidal vol - ume ) mechanical ventilation following a recruitment maneuver 3 and found that derecruitability accelerated throughout the 4 - hour experiment at a rate that increased with the tidal volume used to generate lung injury . This ﬁnding was expected and can potentially be explained as the result of plasma proteins leaking into the airspaces through holes in the epithelial barrier to deactivate pulmonary surfactant . 22 This corresponds to the predications of the present study that leak will in - crease with increased force at end - inspiration . What we have so far been unable to explain , how - ever , is another observation from our previous study , 30 which is that the peak airway pressure during the 4 - h period of mechanical ventilation increased only lin - early and that the rate of increase was independent of tidal volume . Indeed , it was this result that prompted the present modeling study , and the results suggest an answer . Our model predicts that epithelial leak area at end - expiration remains relatively constant with increasing stretch force ( Fig . 4c ) . Accordingly , ﬂow of edematous ﬂuid into the airspaces would be expected to remain relatively constant with increasing tidal volume because more time is spent near end - expira - tion , and at end - inspiration the ﬂow would be opposed by the increased alveolar air pressure . Presumably the movement of proteins into the airspaces is enhanced during the increased leak at end - inspiration to explain the increased derecruitability that occurs with more severe lung injury . We recognize that our current computational model addresses only one mechanism of VILI , barrier distribution caused by overdistension leading to volutrauma and barotrauma , and acknowledge that atelectrauma 1 , 6 , 16 and bio - trauma 12 , 25 , 32 also contribute . Our mouse model experiments show that both atelectrauma and volu - trauma are necessary in the pathogenesis of VILI , and the results of the present model provide insight into how the two are interrelated . Although our model predictions of the eﬀects of stretch on leak seem to make sense in terms of our in vivo studies of lung injury , one can imagine that it might be possible to test these predictions in vitro . In fact , numerous studies 11 , 28 , 33 , 35 , 38 , 41 have investigated stretch - induced injury of an alveolar epithelial mono - layer . Unfortunately , many of these studies have not visualized the progression of leak or damage during stretch in vitro at strain magnitudes and durations large enough to mimic mechanical ventilation , pre - venting full characterization of epithelial barrier dis - ruption in VILI . Additionally , the cells are prone to detachment from the membrane being stretched , 36 so direct validation in this manner might be problematic . Accordingly , the predictions of the present study must be viewed in light of the limitations imposed by the various assumptions we made in creating the model . For example , we assume that breaching the epithelium constitutes the crucial step in allowing plasma ﬂuid and proteins to accumulate in the alveolar spaces and thus cause the disruption of surfactant function that leads to the derangements in lung mechanics associated with ARDS . For this to be the case , however , the endothelium must have already been breached in order to allow interstitial accumula - tion of these blood - derived materials , so presumably a corresponding model could be applied to the breaching of the endothelium . We do not include a mechanism for cell contractility and wound healing in the model because our study was motivated by acute events occurring over an hour or two during the development of VILI in mice . However , modeling VILI over an extended time period would necessitate this addition to the model . We also do not explicitly account for the attachment of the epithelial cells to their basement membrane but instead assume that any mechanical resilience due to this membrane is accounted for in the values of the parameters deﬁning the strengths of the junction nodes and their connecting spring stiﬀnesses . Similarly , because the model is two - dimensional we do not take the heights of the cells into account and any inﬂuence this might have on cell – cell junction strength ; again , such strength variations are assumed to be incorporated into the junction strengths in the model . Also , cells might have an elastic impedance to changes in shape necessitated by height change , assuming that their volumes are conserved . The model could , in principle , be extended to include the third dimension ( cell height ) . For example , Suki and Hubmayr 31 de - scribed a multi - layer spring model with epithelial cells sandwiched between a basement membrane and an alveolar surface ﬁlm ; a similar method could be adapted to the hexagonal cell model . However , we do not believe this would change the essential nature of the predictions of leak formation with stretch . Modeling Epithelial Leak 159 We also considered a model that is purely elastic rather than viscoelastic . This means that leak formation in the model is purely a function of strain and not strain history , which is clearly not the case in reality ; VILI generally arises when injurious stretch to the alveolar tissue is applied cyclically over an extended duration of mechanical ventilation . This eﬀect could be included in the model by replacing the cytoskeletal and cell mem - brane springs with , for example , Kelvin bodies , but solving the model would be computationally much more expensive so as a ﬁrst step we decided to consider the purely elastic case in the present study . Similarly , we could have , in principle , tiled the monolayer with cells that exhibited diﬀerent shapes instead of being identical hexagons , and we could have perhaps considered a monolayer geometry that is more representative of an alveolar wall shape than a simple ﬂat square . However , these seem likely to be details that would introduce second order eﬀects at best , and thus would be unlikely to change our overall conclusions . Our sensitivity analyses ( Figs . 4 , 5 , 6 ) and most especially the single normalized master curves we obtained ( Fig . 4c ) suggest that our model results are robust within these limita - tions . Finally , we have modeled leak as occurring from a single stretch , whereas in VILI such leak occurs over an extended time period that includes many separate breaths . This could be readily included in the model , however , by making node failure above a threshold occur stochastically so that , on average , many cycles could be required above the threshold before a leak ﬁnally occurs . In summary , we have developed a computational model of a sheet of epithelial cells designed to recapit - ulate the manner in which leaks appear in the alveolar epithelium when the lung parenchyma is overstretched during mechanical ventilation . The area of the leak develops in a complex manner as a function of stretch , beginning with a sudden yield point where the ﬁrst leak appears and then progressing slowly as stretch increases , particularly at end - expiration . These model results are compatible with our prior observations 30 in overventilated mice in the sense that they might explain why peak airway pressure increased linearly with pro - gressing lung injury at a rate that was virtually inde - pendent of tidal volume , while derecruitability increased as a function of parenchymal strain .
