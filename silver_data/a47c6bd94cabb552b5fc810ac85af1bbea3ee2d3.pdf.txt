Yang , Elaine Yeh , E . D . Salmon , and Kerry Bloom Department of Biology , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 - 3280 Abstract . Activation of a facultative , dicentric chromo - some provides a unique opportunity to introduce a double strand DNA break into a chromosome at mito - sis . Time lapse video enhanced - differential interference contrast analysis of the cellular response upon dicentric activation reveals that the majority of cells initiates anaphase B , characterized by pole – pole separation , and pauses in mid - anaphase for 30 – 120 min with spin - dles spanning the neck of the bud before completing spindle elongation and cytokinesis . The length of the spindle at the delay point ( 3 – 4 (cid:109) m ) is not dependent on the physical distance between the two centromeres , in - dicating that the arrest represents surveillance of a di - centric induced aberration . No mid - anaphase delay is observed in the absence of the RAD9 checkpoint gene , which prevents cell cycle progression in the presence of damaged DNA . These observations reveal RAD9 - dependent events well past the G2 / M boundary and have considerable implications in understanding how chromosome integrity and the position and state of the mitotic spindle are monitored before cytokinesis . B udding yeast has been one of the key genetic sys - tems in defining the progression of cell cycle events . One of the major paradigms is the accumu - lation and destruction of cyclin – cyclin - dependent kinase complexes ( Nasmyth , 1993 ; Murray , 1995 a ) . By delaying or advancing the timing of cyclin – cyclin - dependent kinase activity , the cell is able to coordinate steps in cell cycle progression , as well as respond to environmentally in - duced damage before downstream events . Cells can delay the onset of DNA synthesis ( S phase ) or mitosis ( M phase ) after exposure to x - rays , (cid:103) irradiation , or ultraviolet light ( Hartwell and Weinert , 1989 ; Weinert and Lydall , 1993 ; Murray , 1995 b ) . DNA lesions are recognized by proteins engaged either in DNA processing ( Rad9 , 24 , 17 , and Mec3 ) or signalling ( Mec1 and Mec2 / Rad53 ) ( Siede et al . , 1993 ; Allen et al . , 1994 ; Weinert et al . , 1994 ; Lydall and Weinert , 1995 ) . Aberrant spindle assembly and alterations in kinetochore structure and function are also subject to surveillance mechanisms that act to delay anaphase onset ( Hoyt et al . , 1991 ; Li and Murray , 1991 ; Spencer and Hi - eter , 1992 ; Gorbsky and Ricketts , 1993 ; Li and Nicklas , 1995 ; Wang and Burke , 1995 ) . These lesions are moni - tored , at least in budding yeast , by the MAD1 , 2 , and 3 and BUB1 , 2 , and 3 genes ( Hoyt et al . , 1991 ; Li and Murray , 1991 ; for review see Wells , 1996 ) . Relatively little information addresses cell cycle regula - tion and checkpoint pathways that may be critical for coor - dinating spindle position and disassembly with cytokinesis . Our recent results from high - resolution video enhanced - ( VE ) 1 and digital enhanced - ( DE ) differential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy of living cells reveal discrete ki - netic and morphological transitions during anaphase pro - gression ( Yeh et al . , 1995 ) . Most notable are the sequential fast and slow phases of spindle elongation and the morpho - logical transition from a sausage shape to a bi - lobed nu - cleus that accompany these rate changes . At anaphase on - set , the 1 . 5 – 2 (cid:109) m spindle spanning the preanaphase nucleus elongates rapidly through the neck of the budded cell ( 1 . 0 (cid:109) m / min ) until the spindle and nucleus achieve a length of (cid:122) 3 – 4 (cid:109) m in a haploid cell . The rate of spindle elongation decreases ( 0 . 3 (cid:109) m / min ) , and the nucleus con - verts from a sausage - shaped structure to a bi - lobed config - uration and elongates until the maximal length of 10 – 12 (cid:109) m is reached . Similar rates and evidence for biphasic spindle elongation have been obtained from observations of spindle pole body movement in living cells , as well ( Ka - hana et al . , 1995 ) . Chromatin separation , as seen by stain - ing with DAPI , appears to be completed in the bi - lobed nucleus . Differential regulation of microtubule dynamics and nuclear and cytoplasmic motor proteins are likely to be involved in the regulation and translocation of the spin - dle during anaphase . Indeed , spindle elongation is con - fined primarily to the mother in cells lacking the microtu - bule - based motor protein dynein ( DHC1 ) , and spindle disassembly and cytokinesis are delayed until the nucleus traverses the neck of the budded cell ( Eshel et al . , 1993 ; Li et al . , 1993 ; Yeh et al . , 1995 ) . The spatial consequence of division by budding is that the plane of cleavage is estab - Please address all correspondence to Kerry Bloom , Department of Biol - ogy , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC 27599 - 3280 .

This config - uration requires spindle migration through the neck be - fore successful cell division , and the dynein mutants reflect the cellular capacity to monitor spindle and / or nuclear po - sition . Studies in populations of budding yeast , after activation of a facultative , dicentric chromosome are also indicative of a mid - anaphase cell cycle checkpoint which can delay progression through mitosis ( Neff and Burke , 1992 ; Brock and Bloom , 1994 ) . These dicentric chromosomes contain two centromeres , one of which is conditionally regulated by the GAL1 transcriptional promoter ( Brock and Bloom , 1994 ) . Transcription is repressed on glucose , and the cen - tromere is completely functional . Growth on galactose ac - tivates the promoter , which in turn , inactivates the cen - tromere . The conditional dicentric chromosome is stably maintained in a monocentric state by growth on galactose and becomes dicentric on glucose . Cells harboring an ac - tive , dicentric chromosome are delayed in their cell cycle transit . A third to one half of the cells in a population are large budded , with nuclear DNA spanning the neck and a short spindle bisecting the nucleus , after the switch to glu - cose as the sole carbon source for growth ( Neff and Burke , 1992 ; Brock and Bloom , 1994 ) . p34 cdc28 kinase activity is elevated in cells containing an active dicentric chromo - some , compared to cells with monocentric chromosomes grown on glucose for comparable times ( Neff and Burke , 1992 ; Brock and Bloom , 1994 ) . The inference from these studies was that the delay preceded the decline of p34 cdc28 kinase activity , and the cells were arrested prior to the exit from mitosis . In the present study , we have used video enhanced and digital enhanced - DIC microscopy to determine the kinet - ics of spindle elongation in individual cells harboring an active dicentric chromosome . Having established a frame - work of morphological landmarks for anaphase spindle progression in wild - type cells ( Yeh et al . , 1995 ) , we have quantitated the kinetics of anaphase , spindle morphology , and spindle length , in individual cells containing active di - centric chromosomes from anaphase to cytokinesis . These studies clearly demonstrate a mid - anaphase delay which is dependent upon the RAD9 checkpoint gene . RAD9 has been shown previously to prevent cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage prior to anaphase onset ( Weinert and Hartwell , 1988 ) . Our results are indicative of a regulated progression from early anaphase to late anaphase during the later stages of mitosis . Materials and Methods Media Yeast rich medium , YPGal and YPD , contained 2 % galactose and glu - cose , respectively , 2 % peptone , and 1 % yeast extract . Yeast minimal me - dia ( SD - URA ) contained 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base , 2 % glucose or galac - tose supplemented with 0 . 5 % casamino acids , and adenine ( 16 . 5 (cid:109) g / ml ) . Strains and Plasmids All strains used in this study are isogenic derivatives of J178 - 1D ( Mat a ade1 met14 ura3 - 52 leu2 - 3 , 112 his3 ) . The 45 - kb dicentric chromosome III strain J178 # 24 ( his4 (cid:68) : : URA3 GALCEN3 ) was constructed by fragment - medi - ated transformation of the conditional centromere at the HIS4 locus ( Hill and Bloom , 1989 ) . The rad9 (cid:68) dicentric strain was constructed by frag - ment - mediated transformation into J178 # 7 ( his4 (cid:68) : : URA3 GALCEN3 : : his4 ) , as previously described by Brock and Bloom ( 1994 ) . The 3 - kb di - centric plasmid yC 2 ( Hill and Bloom , 1987 ) was introduced into J178 - 1D by standard transformation . All dicentric strains were grown in galactose - containing medium to maintain chromosome III or the plasmid yC 2 as monocentric . Immunofluorescence Immunofluorescent staining of yeast cells was performed essentially as de - scribed by Pringle et al . ( 1989 ) . Cells were grown to early to mid - logarithmic phase growth in galactose - containing medium . Cells were pelleted , washed once with sterile water , resuspended in glucose - containing medium , and returned to 32 (cid:56) C for 1 – 2 h . Cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 2 h at 25 (cid:56) C before processing for immunofluorescence . Microtubules were vi - sualized with the rat anti – (cid:97) - tubulin antibody YOL1 / 34 ( Accurate Chemi - cal and Scientific Corp . , Westbury , NY ) . Rhodamine - conjugated goat anti – rat ( Cappel Labs , Malvern , PA ) was used as the secondary antibody . Cells were incubated with DAPI ( 1 (cid:109) g / ml ) for 5 min before the addition of mounting medium . Images were acquired and stored for further analysis , as described for FISH . Fluorescent digital images were analyzed with dis - tance measuring tools within Metamorph software ( Salmon et al . , 1994 ) . To visualize the nucleus , cells were fixed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 1 h at 25 (cid:56) C . Fixed cells were washed once with water and resuspended in 1 (cid:109) g / ml DAPI for 5 min . The cells were washed once with water and mounted in mounting medium . Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization J178 # 24 was grown to an A 660 (cid:53) 0 . 2 density in galactose - containing me - dium before switching to YPD for 1 h . Cells were fixed and stained with DAPI ( 1 (cid:109) g / ml for 5 min ) or subjected to fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) as described by Guacci et al . ( 1994 ) . Images were visualized with a Figure 1 . Dicentric chromosome breakage resulting from cen - tromere movements during prometaphase or anaphase . A sche - matic diagram representing possible centromere attachments of a dicentric chromosome to the mitotic spindle during prometa - phase and anaphase . During prometaphase , the two centromeres will independently form bipolar attachments to the mitotic spin - dle . A dicentric chromosome in which the two centromeres have formed initial monopolar attachments to opposite spindle poles is shown in the top figure . Centromere movements toward opposite spindle poles , as indicated by the arrows , may result in chromo - some breakage . During anaphase B , when the two centromeres of a dicentric chromosome have successfully formed bipolar at - tachments , centromere movements at anaphase may result in chromosome breakage . If the two centromeres of each chromo - some are oriented toward the same spindle pole ( top ) , chromo - some segregation is normal . If the centromeres are oriented to - ward opposite spindle poles ( bottom ) , anaphase bridges are formed , and chromosome breakage can occur ( Brock and Bloom , 1994 ) . on A p r il 13 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 27 , 1997 Yang et al .

Results The probability of double strand breakage in a dicentric chromosome is influenced by the behavior of each of the paired centromeres relative to the spindle poles . If the two centromeres on one sister chromatid are oriented to oppo - site poles , a dicentric bridge is formed , followed by break - age , or chromosome loss .

If each centromere behaves independently , we expect to observe two populations of cells . Half of the cells will generate a broken chromosome , and half of the cells may propagate intact , dicentric molecules during cell division ( Fig . 1 ; Koshland et al . , 1987 ) . The timing of decatenation of sister chromatids will also affect the behavior of the dicentric chromosome . This potential for different chromosome configurations on the spindle and hence , chromosome breakage or maintenance , has limited previous studies on populations of cells . Real Time Analysis of Cells Harboring an Active Dicentric Chromosome VE - DIC microscopy of individual cells allowed us to visu - alize distinct cellular responses upon dicentric chromo - some activation ( Fig . 2 ) . Cells containing the facultative dicentric chromosome were grown to mid - logarithmic phase in galactose ( monocentric conditions ) and switched to glu - cose ( dicentric conditions ) for VE - DIC analysis . Two dis - tinct mitotic populations of cells were observed ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) and confirm the expectations predicted from the in - dependent behavior of the two centromeres . One popula - tion , 7 / 29 cells ( Fig . 3 ) , mimicked wild - type cells in their kinetic progression through the cell cycle . The initial rapid elongation was completed in 7 (cid:54) 2 min , the transition from the sausage shape to bi - lobed nuclear morphology took 9 (cid:54) 2 min , and cytokinesis followed 35 (cid:54) 5 min later ( Yeh et al . , 1995 ) . Aberrant nuclear morphology and a considerable delay between the fast and slow phases of anaphase were ob - served in 22 / 29 of the mitotic cells ( Figs . 2 and 4 ) . During the initial phases of spindle elongation , a finger - like pro - trusion of the nucleus into the bud was seen , rather than the typical formation of a sausage - shaped nucleus . This protrusion seemingly snaked its way into the bud for (cid:122) 5 (cid:54) 1 min ( Fig . 4 A ) . As the spindle elongated to (cid:122) 4 (cid:109) m in length , the nucleus remained rounded in shape as it tra - versed the neck of the dividing cell ( Fig . 2 C ) . The time from nuclear protrusion to the formation of this rounded sausage nucleus took 10 (cid:54) 6 min ( Fig . 4 A ) . Interestingly , the nucleus continued to maintain this round to sausage - shaped morphology for 47 (cid:54) 18 min before further spindle elongation and the transition to bi - lobed structures . This is significantly longer than the 9 (cid:54) 2 min transition in wild - type cells , indicating a significant delay in both the kinetics Figure 3 . No mid - anaphase pause .

Mid - anaphase Checkpoints in Yeast 349 and morphological transitions that accompany anaphase B . Once the bulk of the nucleus formed a bi - lobed mor - phology and began the slow phase of spindle elongation , the time to cytokinesis was 38 (cid:54) 10 min , similar to that ob - served in wild - type cells . Coincidence of Nuclear and Spindle Position at the Mid - anaphase Delay Bending of the mitotic spindle in and out of the plane of focus often precludes direct visualization of the spindle by VE - DIC microscopy . To confirm that position of the nu - cleus during mid - anaphase corresponds to actual spindle elongation through the neck , we compared the length of the nucleus in fixed cells , as determined by DAPI staining , to the length of the mitotic spindle , as visualized by indi - rect immunofluorescence . Cells containing the conditional dicentric chromosome were grown on galactose - contain - ing medium and switched to glucose - containing medium for 2 h to activate the dicentric chromosome . Cells were fixed and stained for nuclear ( DAPI ) and spindle ( anti – (cid:97) - tubulin immunofluorescence ) analysis . In all budded cells with DNA spanning the neck ( 36 / 36 ) , the mitotic spindle had elongated through the neck ( compare Fig . 5 , C and D ; E and F ) . Quantitation of the length of tubulin immuno - fluorescence and of DAPI staining along the mother bud axis in G2 and mid - anaphase arrested cells shows an excel - lent correlation between the two measurements . In G2 cells ( medium size bud , nucleus near the neck ) , the mean spindle length was 1 . 25 (cid:54) 0 . 23 (cid:109) m , and the mean nuclear length was 1 . 31 (cid:54) 0 . 19 (cid:109) m ( n (cid:53) 13 ) ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . Early stages of anaphase in cells containing an active di - centric chromosome were often characterized by finger - like protrusions of the nucleus into the bud ( Fig . 2 B , VE - DIC ; Fig . 5 D , DAPI staining ) . Correspondingly , the spindle spanned the distance from the end of the bulk of chroma - tin in the mother to the tip of the finger - like protrusion in the bud ( Fig . 5 C , 2 . 54 (cid:109) m in length ) . In cells exhibiting a mid - anaphase pause , the mean spindle length was 4 . 17 (cid:54) 0 . 92 (cid:109) m and the mean nuclear length was 4 . 09 (cid:54) 0 . 91 (cid:109) m ( Fig . 5 , E and F , n (cid:53) 31 ) . Thus the fixed images corroborate the progression , as well as the length measurements , in early to mid - anaphase , as determined in the real time anal - ysis , and indicate the close correspondence between nu - clear and spindle elongation throughout anaphase . Kinetic Analysis of Spindle Elongation The kinetics of spindle elongation were determined using a semi - automated tracking system to quantitate spindle morphogenesis and elongation ( Skibbens et al . , 1993 ) . The direction of spindle movement could be assessed by deter - mining the position of the leading and lagging edge of the nuclear envelope relative to the neck of the budded cell . The neck provided an accurate frame of reference in stan - dardizing data from individual cells and was set at 0 (cid:109) m . Movements of the spindle pole into the bud ( leading edge ) were plotted as negative values and movement into the mother ( lagging edge ) as positive values . The nucleus abutted the neck immediately preceding spindle elonga - tion , and elongation was directed into the bud . In an ex - ample of a dicentric cell that displayed wild - type kinetics , both fast and slow phases of spindle elongation , from 2 to 8 – 10 (cid:109) m , were complete in (cid:122) 22 min ( Fig . 3 B ) . Cells de - layed in anaphase B progression ( Fig . 4 B ) displayed the initial rapid elongation phase ( 2 – 4 (cid:109) m ) , which was fol - lowed by a pause in spindle elongation in which the nu - cleus remained in the neck for a significant amount of time ( up to 60 min in Fig . 4 B ) . Only after this pause , was the second phase of elongation able to proceed to the maximal spindle length of 10 – 12 (cid:109) m . Sister Chromatid Separation at the Mid - anaphase Transition The partially elongated spindles indicate a delay in ana - phase B spindle pole separation . However , the degree of chromosome separation was not apparent in the VE - DIC images . We therefore used FISH to visualize sister chro - matids in cells arrested in mid - anaphase . Asynchronous populations of cells containing the conditional dicentric chromosome were grown on galactose and switched to glucose for 1 – 2 h , when (cid:122) 16 % of the cells were arrested as large budded cells with DNA spanning the neck ( Table I ) .

Guacci ; Guacci et al . , 1994 ) , we determined that 34 % of cells containing an ac - tive dicentric chromosome contained two spots within the nucleus ( Fig . 6 ) . In contrast , 8 % of the cells were observed to have two fluorescent spots within the nucleus in wild - type , asynchronous populations using the same DNA probes ( Fig . 6 ) . The 8 % of cells with separated sisters in wild - type populations can be attributed to the time ex - pected for centromeres to separate within one chromatin mass ( Yeh et al . , 1995 ) . Anaphase spindle elongation ( from the fast phase to the bi - lobed structures ) persists for (cid:122) 9 min ( Fig . 3 A ) . 9 / 90 min doubling time predicts that 10 % of the population will be caught in the mid - anaphase stage . This value compares quite favorably to the 8 % deter - mined by FISH ( Fig . 6 B ; Guacci et al . , 1994 ) . By the same reasoning we can predict what fraction of cells harboring a dicentric chromosome will be in mid - anaphase in a loga - rithmic growing population . The dicentric delay persists for 57 min ( Fig . 4 ) . The doubling time of this population is (cid:122) 150 min , resulting in (cid:122) 38 % of the cells at the mid - anaphase transition at any one time . However , only about a third of the cells in a population pause in response to ac - tivation of the dicentric chromosome ( Neff and Burke , 1992 ; Brock and Bloom , 1994 ) . We therefore estimate 2 / 3 ( 8 % ) (cid:49) 1 / 3 ( 38 % ) (cid:53) 17 . 8 % of cells to be in mid - anaphase . This value compares quite favorably to the 16 % of cells found to be in mid - anaphase , as determined by DAPI staining ( Table I ) , but less than that determined by FISH ( 34 % ) . While the high FISH value is certainly indicative of sister chromatid separation in the population of mid - anaphase cells , it may also reflect centromere separation in a frac - tion of large - budded cells with DNA at the neck ( Table I ) as well as cells with separated nuclei ( Table I , last column ) , in which the spindles may have collapsed and given rise to apparently undivided nuclei with two spots . In any case , the centromere regions of sister chromatids have sepa - rated in nuclei of cells containing active dicentric chromo - somes , indicating these cells traverse the metaphase / anaphase boundary and become blocked following either anaphase A or anaphase A and B , with partially elongated spindles , i . e . , mid - anaphase . Checkpoint Versus Physical Constraints on Spindle Elongation The mid - anaphase delay could reflect a physical constraint on spindle elongation , with the DNA between the two centromeres constraining the poles from further separa - tion . Alternatively , a cellular response to the dicentric in - sult could prevent further elongation ( Fig . 7 ) . To distin - guish between these possibilities we have analyzed the kinetics and spindle length of the mid - anaphase transition in cells containing variants of dicentric chromosome III , in which the centromeres are 3 vs . 45 kb pairs apart . 45 kb of DNA is (cid:122) 15 (cid:109) m in its linear form . Estimation of the pack - ing ratio in chromatin ( sevenfold around a nucleosome ) or the degree of condensation from FISH ( 80 fold ; Guacci et al . , 1994 ) provide an approximate length of this region to be anywhere from 0 . 2 – 2 (cid:109) m in vivo .

Mid - anaphase Checkpoints in Yeast 351 mosomes with their centromeres 3 kb apart would be ex - pected to span (cid:122) 0 . 02 – 0 . 2 (cid:109) m in vivo . If the physical con - straint model is correct , the length of the spindle at the arrest point would reflect centromere – centromere dis - tances , and activation of a dicentric chromosome with the centromeres 3 kb apart might result in a 10 - fold difference in spindle length at the delay point . As shown in Fig . 8 , cells containing the 3 - kb dicentric minichromosome ex - hibit similar kinetics and morphologies as those of a cell containing the 45 - kb dicentric chromosome . Thus the mid - anaphase pause is not a function of the length between the two centromeres . Checkpoint Genes in the Mid - anaphase Transition Defects in chromosome alignment , kinetochore attach - ment , or DNA breakage have all been shown to be subject to cell cycle surveillance . The distinguishing feature of de - fects monitored by these checkpoint pathways is that they delay anaphase onset . Previous studies performed by DAPI staining of fixed populations and FACS ® analysis have revealed RAD9 to be involved in mediating the di - centric response ( Brock and Bloom , 1994 ) . We have reex - amined the role of RAD9 in the real time assay to deter - mine whether the delay in mid - anaphase is also dependent upon this checkpoint gene . A single cellular response was observed upon dicentric chromosome activation in the rad9 deletion strain ( Fig . 9 , 9 / 9 cells ; Table II ) . The behav - ior of the spindle and the timing of nuclear transitions were indistinguishable from wild - type cells . Discussion Time lapse , VE - and DE - DIC analysis of cells containing an active dicentric chromosome reveals a delay in their progression through anaphase . By two criteria , spindle elongation and sister chromatid separation , cells contain - ing an active dicentric chromosome transiently pause in mid - anaphase , before maximal spindle elongation and the exit from mitosis . This mid - anaphase delay is dependent on the RAD9 DNA checkpoint gene , indicative of DNA damage surveillance pathways operative during late stages in the cell cycle ( Fig . 10 ) . The mid - anaphase delay was distinguished by both ki - netic and morphological criteria . Upon activation of the dicentric chromosome , the bulk of the nucleus remained in Figure 7 . Nature of the mid - anaphase pause . The arrest in mid - anaphase B may be due to physical constraints on the chromo - some during spindle elongation . This would predict a dependent relationship between spindle length and the distance between the two centromeres . Alternatively , activation of the dicentric chro - mosome and subsequent chromosomal alterations may signal a surveillance system resulting in cell cycle arrest . Spindle length at the mid - anaphase transition would be independent of the dis - tance between the two centromeres . Figure 8 . Kinetics and spindle dynamics upon activation of a di - centric minichromosome . The distance between the two centro - meres is 3 kb . As shown in Figs . 3 and 4 , two cellular responses are observed upon dicentric activation . ( A ) No mid - anaphase pause : Approximately 50 % of the cells ( 9 / 19 ) exhibit wild type ki - netics . Mid - anaphase pause : The other 50 % ( 11 / 19 ) are delayed in the 3 – 4 (cid:109) m stage of spindle elongation ( finger projection , gourd - shaped nucleus ) . The average time spent in mid - anaphase was 59 (cid:54) 10 min .

Even as the spindle doubled its length the nucleus re - mained rounded and only later became noticeably sausage shaped ( Fig . 2 C ) . In contrast , the nucleus in wild - type cells underwent a rounded to sausage - shaped transition as it traversed the neck and elongated to 4 (cid:109) m ( Fig . 3 ; Yeh et al . , 1995 ) . The morphological transitions characteristic of dicentric chromosome activation were accompanied by a 30 – 120 - min temporal delay in the subsequent elongation of the mid - anaphase spindle . This 4 (cid:109) m stage of spindle morphogenesis is likely to represent a critical juncture in spindle function in wild - type cells as well . In an elegant three - dimensional , serial section reconstruction of a yeast spindle , populations of anaphase spindles sorted into two classes based on their lengths : 3 . 7 and 9 . 4 (cid:109) m ( Winey et al . , 1995 ) . Both populations of spindles were shown to strad - dle the neck , and in either population , sister chromatids had already migrated to the poles based upon the length of the presumptive kinetochore microtubules . These data corroborate our findings that sister chromatids have sepa - rated at the 4 (cid:109) m mid - anaphase delay ( Fig . 6 ) . The pre - ponderance of 3 . 7 (cid:109) m spindles reported by Winey et al . ( 1995 ) also reflects the brief pause which often occurs in wild - type cells between the fast and slow phases of ana - phase spindle elongation ( Yeh et al . , 1995 ) . In addition , the oscillatory motion observed in the 4 (cid:109) m spindle in wild - type cells ( Yeh et al . , 1995 ) is indicative of a natural transition in spindle progression . Thus , both serial recon - struction of fixed cells and VE - DIC microscopy of live preparations indicate a clear transition from medial to elongated nuclear structures in wild - type cells . The dicen - tric chromosome insult simply prolongs this natural transi - tion in the development of the anaphase spindle . There are several aspects of dicentric chromosome acti - vation that may contribute to the delay . One is that ten - sion generated by the chromosome bridge could restrain spindle elongation . The finger - like protrusions of the nu - cleus into the bud ( Figs . 4 A and 5 D ) , appear to be futile attempts by the spindle / nucleus to initiate anaphase spin - dle pole separation . This period ( 5 min duration ) has no correlate in the kinetic progression of a wild type cell . These protrusions , and the rounded morphology of the nu - cleus as it traversed the neck of the dividing cell ( Fig . 2 C ) , probably reflect transient physical constraints on the spin - dle . The time lapse studies with centromeres at different distances ( 3 vs . 45 kb apart ) indicate that the arrest in spin - dle elongation is not exclusively due to a DNA bridge con - straining anaphase pole separation . Cells containing either dicentric chromosome display virtually identical spindle morphologies and lengths ( 4 (cid:109) m ) for similar durations ( 47 – 59 min on average ; Table II ) . Thus the mid - anaphase delay likely represents surveillance mechanisms that effec - tively inactivate the microtubule assembly and motility mechanisms which normally produce further spindle elon - gation . The dependency of the mid - anaphase delay on the RAD9 gene reveals that the DNA damage checkpoint continues to monitor chromosome integrity well after the start of anaphase , as well as before anaphase onset ( Fig . 10 ) . Thus RAD9 - dependent DNA damage arrests the cell at any stage ( G1 , S , G2 , and now mid - anaphase ) . This notion is similar to recent findings that checkpoint genes ( RAD9 , Siede et al . , 1993 ; and the SAD1 / RAD53 protein kinase , Allen et al . , 1994 ) indeed control multiple checkpoints . Whether the damage leads to the same or different signal in each stage , or different signals in the same stage , is not well understood , but several genes are clearly involved at multiple stages of the cycle . Rad9p is constitutively ex - pressed throughout the cell cycle ( Schiestl et al . , 1989 ) , consistent with the proposal that this protein is involved in DNA surveillance throughout G1 / S , G2 / M , and anaphase / cytokinesis . It is also likely that DNA lesions , in addition to a dicentric - induced aberration , are also subject to RAD9 surveillance at mid - anaphase . However , due to the Figure 9 . The dicentric chromosome – induced mid - anaphase tran - sition is dependent upon the RAD9 gene . A single cellular re - sponse was observed upon dicentric chromosome activation in the rad9 deletion strain . The behavior of the spindle and the tim - ing of nuclear transitions were indistinguishable from wild type cells . ( A ) Kinetics of morphological transitions .

Mid - anaphase Checkpoints in Yeast 353 rapidity of spindle elongation and the relatively extended lengths of G1 / S and G2 / M , the mid - anaphase delay would be difficult to identify in a population study . In this regard , we have examined the effect of a dominant negative form of topoisomerase I ( top1 - 103 ) , which also results in a RAD9 - dependent cell cycle arrest ( Levin et al . , 1993 ) . As reported previously , a large fraction of cells exhibited the large budded RAD9 - dependent arrest morphology follow - ing 8 h of top1 - 103 induction . However , DAPI staining of the cells revealed two classes of arrest morphologies . About two - thirds of the cells displayed a single nucleus at the neck of large budded cells , while one - third exhibited elongated nuclei ( sausage - shaped ) spanning the neck re - gion between the mother and bud ( Beach , D . , and K . Bloom , unpublished results ) . This second class of cells is identical in morphology to cells which arrest in mid - anaphase and indicates that a variety of DNA lesions can lead to delays in mid - anaphase . The description of a mid to late - anaphase checkpoint leads to the notion that the major cyclin - dependent ki - nase – cyclin complexes , other regulatory kinases , e . g . , DBF2 and 20 ( Toyn and Johnston , 1994 ) , cyclin destruction , or other anaphase - progression factors , are operative after anaphase onset ( Irniger et al . , 1995 ) . In fact , H1 kinase levels remain elevated for prolonged periods in yeast cell populations following activation of the dicentric chromo - some ( Neff and Burke , 1992 ; Brock and Bloom , 1994 ) . Cy - clins and H1 kinase activity persist throughout anaphase in budding yeast , Drosophila , and nontransformed mamma - lian cells ( Surana et al . , 1993 ; Girard et al . , 1995 ; Sigrist et al . , 1995 ) . In budding yeast , fully activated cyclins or overex - pression of nondegradable forms of cyclin prevent spindle disassembly at telophase , rather than anaphase onset ( Stueland et al . , 1993 ; Surana et al . , 1993 ) , and high levels of cdc28 / clb are found in cells arrested at telophase ( cdc15 ; Surana et al . , 1993 ; Irniger et al . , 1995 ) . The persistence of cyclin / clb complexes throughout anaphase raises the possi - bility that they may be involved in regulating the progres - sion of anaphase directly , or by delaying anaphase pro - gression in response to perturbation . The coexistence of subpopulations of degraded and protected cyclins ( Irniger et al . , 1995 ) is also suggestive of a role for the cdc28 / cyclin B complex in mediating the progression of anaphase , spin - dle disassembly , and cytokinesis . Thus the sequential deg - radation of different cyclins may drive the progression from metaphase to telophase , or may be required to delay anaphase progression in the event of damage . The description of a mid - anaphase transition raises two major questions . Upon sister chromatid separation , the cells lose a major pathway for repair of DNA damage . Therefore , why have a mid - anaphase checkpoint ? Sec - ondly , what perturbations are monitored by this check - point in the normal course of cell division ? Several at - tributes of mitosis in budding yeast shed light on these issues . Yeast chromosomes have not been observed to align on a metaphase plate before anaphase onset . This has been thought to reflect the absence of chromosome condensation . However , Winey et al . ( 1995 ) demonstrated that kinetochore microtubules shorten asynchronously , re - flecting the asynchronous movement of chromosomes to Figure 10 . Anaphase spindle morphogenesis in yeast . The major transitions in spindle morphogenesis . Formation and maintenance of a 2 (cid:109) m spindle are dependent upon members of the kinesin family ( CIN8 , KIP1 and KAR3 ; Saunders and Hoyt , 1992 ; Saunders et al . , 1995 ) , and checkpoint genes that limit anaphase onset ( AO ) ( BUB1 , 2 , and 3 , Hoyt et al . , 1991 ; MAD1 , 2 and 3 , Li and Murray , 1991 ; RAD9 , Weinert and Hartwell , 1988 ) . Separation of the spindle poles ( spindle elongation ) and translocation of the spindle through the bud neck are simultaneous in wild type cells , characterized by fast spindle elongation ( Yeh et al . , 1995 ) . VE - DIC microscopy of live cells and of serial reconstruction of yeast spindles indicates a transition between the fast ( 1 (cid:109) m / min ) to slow ( 0 . 3 (cid:109) m / min ) phases of spindle morphogenesis in wild type cells . This transition in mid - anaphase is prolonged upon activation of the dicentric chromosome and is de - pendent upon RAD9 function . Chromosome separation ( noted morphologically by the bilobed structure ) is delayed upon activation of the dicentric chromosome . The final stages of spindle elongation , disassembly , nuclear division , and cytokinesis are discrete morpholog - ical events ( Copeland and Snyder , 1993 ; Yeh et al . , 1995 ) . We propose that this mid - anaphase checkpoint is essential for coordinating spindle morphogenesis and position with chromosome separation and the onset of cytokinesis . on A p r il 13 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 27 , 1997 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 354 the poles . Mid - anaphase may therefore represent the last time in the cell cycle where errors in attachment may be rectified . Alternatively , the mid - anaphase transition could represent the last stage for DNA repair between sister chromatids . While FISH experiments ( Guacci et al . , 1994 ) and results from analysis of sister chromatids at the mid - anaphase delay ( Fig . 6 ) indicate that sister centromeres have separated at this stage , the chromosome arms may not be completely disjoined . The uniformity of DAPI stain - ing in cells with 4 (cid:109) m spindles spanning the neck indicates that the bulk of the chromosomal DNA is evenly distrib - uted within the nucleus . In contrast , the morphological transition to a bi - lobed nucleus results in substantial sepa - ration of chromosomal DNA . This most likely represents the final decatenation between sister chromatids and the irreversible commitment to chromosome separation ( Fig . 10 ) . In this view , the mid - anaphase transition represents the stage prior to the final commitment to complete DNA separation . The temporal coordination between comple - tion of sister chromatid decatenation and force generation for spindle elongation necessary for preventing chromo - some breakage may be the primary reason for the mid - anaphase pause , and one that may be important for all eu - karyotic organisms . Loss of coordination of these events in transformed cells lacking mid - anaphase checkpoints may result in increased chromosome breakage , giving rise to chromosomal rearrangements , loss of genomic integrity , and hence , the neoplastic state .
