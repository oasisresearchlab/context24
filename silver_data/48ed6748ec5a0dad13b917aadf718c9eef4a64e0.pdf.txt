Although this process controls long - term depression ( LTD ) induction in the hippocampus , how it is regu - lated by neuronal activities is not completely clear . Here , we show that Ca 2 + inﬂux through the NMDA receptor activates calcineurin and protein phos - phatase 1 to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase g 661 ( PIP5K g 661 ) , the major phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) - producing enzyme in the brain . Bimolecular ﬂuores - cence complementation analysis revealed that the dephosphorylated PIP5K g 661 became associated with the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP - 2 at postsynapses in situ . NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis and low - frequency stimula - tion - induced LTD were completely blocked by inhib - iting the association between dephosphorylated PIP5K g 661 and AP - 2 and by overexpression of a kinase - dead PIP5K g 661 mutant in hippocampal neurons . Furthermore , knockdown of PIP5K g 661 inhibited the NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endo - cytosis . Therefore , NMDA receptor activation controls AMPA receptor endocytosis during hippo - campal LTD by regulating PIP5K g 661 activity at postsynapses . INTRODUCTION AMPA receptors mainly mediate fast excitatory neurotransmis - sion at synapses located on dendritic spines of vertebrate neurons . Alterations in neural activities induce long - lasting changes in synaptic transmission , such as long - term depression ( LTD ) , which underlies certain aspects of learning and memory ( Bredt and Nicoll , 2003 ) . When neuronal activities increase moderately during LTD - inducing stimuli , postsynaptic AMPA receptors are thought to be freed from their anchoring proteins , to diffuse laterally to the endocytic zone , and to undergo clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Bredt and Nicoll , 2003 ; Cognet et al . , 2006 ; Wang and Linden , 2000 ) . Adaptor protein complex - 2 ( AP - 2 ) binds to the AMPA receptor and plays a crucial role in re - cruiting clathrin ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Man et al . , 2000 ) . However , it has been unclear whether and how neuronal activities regulate AP - 2 and other components of the endocytic machinery at postsynapses . At presynaptic sites , elevated neuronal activity induces the clathrin - mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) . The membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphos - phate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) plays a key role in recruiting AP - 2 and several components of the endocytic machinery to endocytic hot spots at the presynaptic terminal ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Rohde et al . , 2002 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is produced predominantly from phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate by phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIP5K ) ( Loijens and Anderson , 1996 ) . Of three PIP5K a - g isozymes , PIP5K g is highly and predominantly expressed in the brain ( Akiba et al . , 2002 ; Wenk et al . , 2001 ) and has three splicing variants , PIP5K g 635 , PIP5 g 661 , and PIP5K g 687 ( Giudici et al . , 2004 ; Ish - ihara et al . , 1996 ; Ishihara et al . , 1998 ; Loijens and Anderson , 1996 ) . The small GTPase ARF6 activates both PIP5K g ( Krauss et al . , 2003 ) and PIP5K a ( Honda et al . , 1999 ) . PIP5K g 661 is also activated by talin ( Morgan et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , increased neuronal activity induces dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 ( Akiba et al . , 2002 ; Wenk et al . , 2001 ) by calcineurin , which is activated by Ca 2 + inﬂux through voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels ( VDCCs ) ( Lee et al . , 2005 ; Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . The dephosphorylated PIP5K g 661 becomes enzymati - cally active by binding AP - 2 at presynaptic endocytic spots and produces PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to further recruit AP - 2 and other Neuron 73 , 135 – 148 , January 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 135 components of the early endocytic machinery ( Nakano - Kobaya - shi et al . , 2007 ) . In this study , we examined whether and how the endocytic machinery is regulated during low - frequency stimulation ( LFS ) - induced LTD at postsynapses of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampal slices . This form of LTD depends on the activation of NMDA receptors and protein phosphatases ( Mulkey et al . , 1993 ) . We found that Ca 2 + inﬂux through the NMDA receptor , but not through VDCC , activated protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) and calcineurin and dephosphorylated PIP5K g 661 , which then bound to AP - 2 at postsynapses . NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis and the LFS - induced LTD were completely blocked by inhibit - ing the association between PIP5K g 661 and AP - 2 and by over - expression of a kinase - dead PIP5K g 661 mutant in postsynaptic neurons . These results suggest that NMDA receptor activation dynamically controls early steps of the clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis during hippocampal LTD by regulating the PIP5K g 661 activity . RESULTS PIP5K g 661 Localizes to Postsynapses Of the three splice variants of PIP5K g , PIP5K g 661 was selec - tively expressed in mouse hippocampus in vivo and in vitro ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . PIP5K g 661 expression was observed in mouse hippocampus from approximately 2 weeks after birth in vivo and in vitro , and it increased during late postnatal devel - opment ( Figures 1A and 1B ) . To examine whether PIP5K g 661 is present on postsynapses , we ﬁrst analyzed cultured hippocampal neurons at 18 days in vitro ( DIV ) by immunocytochemistry . When green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged PIP5K g 661 ( GFP - PIP5K g 661 ) was ex - pressed in hippocampal neurons , the GFP signal was observed in dendrites , which were immunopositive for microtubule - asso - ciated protein 2 ( MAP2 ) , and in spines protruding from the dendrites ( Figure 1C ) . Like postsynaptic density 95 ( PSD - 95 ) and ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) , which were concentrated in the dendritic spines , endogenous PIP5K g 661 was enriched in Figure 1 .

Endogenous PIP5K g 661 partially colocalized with PSD - 95 and F - actin ( Figures 1D and 1E ) . Furthermore , immuno - blot analysis of the subcellular fractions of adult mouse brain showed PIP5K g 661 not only in the SV fraction , which was immu - nonegative for PSD - 95 , but also in the PSD fractions , which were immunonegative for an SV marker synaptophysin ( Figure 1F ) . Together , these results indicate that PIP5K g 661 localizes at least in part to postsynapses . PIP5K g 661 Is Dephosphorylated by NMDA - Induced Ca 2 + Inﬂux The dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 by calcineurin plays an essential role in the activity - dependent production of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at presynapses ( Lee et al . , 2005 ; Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . To examine whether PIP5K g 661 is also dephosphorylated at postsynapses , we treated hippocampal neurons with NMDA , which induces AMPA receptor endocytosis and LTD ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Lin et al . , 2000 ) . To block action potential - induced VDCC activation at pre - synapses , we included tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) in the culture medium . Immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates with an anti - PIP5K g antibody revealed that an additional PIP5K g 661 band , which migrated faster on electrophoresis gels , appeared after NMDA treatment ( Figure 2A ) . This band likely corresponds to the dephosphorylated form of PIP5K g 661 , because PIP5K g 661 migrated to the same position when the lysates were treated with l - phosphatase before electrophoresis ( Figure 2A ) .

Neuron Activation of PIP5K Is Essential for LTD Neuron 73 , 135 – 148 , January 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 137 treatment increased the dephosphorylated form of PIP5K g 661 in a dose - dependent manner , with an EC 50 of approximately 30 m M ( Figure 2B ) . The dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 was observed as early as 5 min and was saturated by 20 min after 50 m M NMDA treatment ( Figure 2C ) . These results indicate that PIP5K g 661 is mostly phosphorylated at the basal level and is rapidly dephosphorylated upon NMDA treatment . The concen - tration and duration of NMDA treatment were similar to those used previously to induce AMPA receptor endocytosis in cultured neurons ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Lin et al . , 2000 ) . To examine the molecular mechanism responsible for the NMDA - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 , we treated hippocampal neurons with various pharmacological reagents . The NMDA antagonist D - APV or the Ca 2 + chelator EGTA completely blocked the NMDA - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 ( Figure 2D ) , demonstrating that Ca 2 + entry through the NMDA receptor is essential for this process . Calcineurin inhibitors , cyclosporine A and FK - 520 , partially inhibited the NMDA - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 ( Figure 2D ) . In contrast , the dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 was almost completely blocked by a high concentration ( 1 m M ) of okadaic acid ( Figure 2D ) , which inhibits both PP1 and protein phospha - tase 2A ( PP2A ) . Because a low concentration ( 10 nM ) of okadaic acid and fostriecin , which speciﬁcally inhibit PP2A ( Bialojan and Takai , 1988 ; Boritzki et al . , 1988 ) , were ineffective ( Figure 2D ) , the NMDA - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 was probably mediated by PP1 and partially by cal - cineurin . These results were in contrast to the dominant role of calcineurin in the high - KCl - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 at presynapses ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . Indeed , the NMDA - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 was not inhibited by a cocktail of Ca 2 + channel blockers ( Fig - ures 2E and S2 ) . Therefore , the direct calcium inﬂux through NMDA receptors likely activates a speciﬁc pathway that involves PP1 and calcineurin and dephosphorylates PIP5K g 661 at postsynapses . NMDA Receptor Activation Triggers an Interaction of PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 The AP - 2 subunit b 2 adaptin was previously shown to interact directly with the dephosphorylated form of PIP5K g 661 in vitro ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . To examine whether NMDA treatment induces the interaction of PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 in neurons , we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay using cultured hippocampal neurons . AP - 2 subunits ( a and b adaptins ) were coimmunoprecipitated with PIP5K g 661 upon NMDA treat - ment ( Figure 3A ) . Furthermore , immunocytochemical analysis of hippocampal neurons expressing hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged PIP5K g 661 and FLAG - tagged b 2 adaptin revealed that as early as 5 min after NMDA application , colocalization of HA and FLAG immunoreactivities was detected and saturated by 10 min in the dendrites ( Figure S3 ) . To examine whether this interaction occurs at postsynapses , we performed a bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation ( BiFC ) assay using N - and C - terminal subfragments of Venus , which were fused to the ear domain of b 2 adaptin ( VN - b 2 ear ) and wild - type PIP5K g 661 ( VC - PIP5K - WT ) , respectively . In this assay , interaction of fused proteins mediates the reconstitution of Venus , resulting in efﬁcient ﬂuorescence emission ( Kerppola , 2006 ) . Time - lapse imaging of hippocampal neurons expressing these fusion proteins showed Venus ﬂuorescent puncta appear - ing along the neurites , approximately 2 min after NMDA treatment ( Figure 3B and Movie S1 ) . Changes in ﬂuorescence intensity were detected faster than those reported for full chro - mophore maturation in BiFC studies ( Kerppola , 2006 ) , but several studies of interaction between various proteins have re - ported rapid changes in ﬂuorescence intensity in response to stimuli ( Guo et al . , 2005 ; MacDonald et al . , 2006 ; Schmidt et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , immunocytochemical analysis con - ﬁrmed that most Venus puncta corresponded to spines on MAP2 - positive dendrites ( Figure 3C ) and colocalized with PSD - 95 and F - actin ( Figures 3D and 3E ) . As a negative control , we expressed N - and C - terminal fragments of Venus fused to proteins that do not interact with each other in hippocampal neurons . The combination of VN - tagged glutathione S - trans - ferase ( GST ) and VC , VN - b 2 ear , and VC , or VN - GST and VC - PIP5K - WT gave rise to diffuse background ﬂuorescence throughout dendrites and never showed punctate ﬂuorescence ( Figure S4A ) . These results indicate that NMDA receptor activa - tion triggers the interaction of PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 at postsy - napses in hippocampal neurons . The phosphorylation of Ser at position 645 of PIP5K g 661 blocks its interaction with b 2 adaptin ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . To examine whether such a dephosphorylation - dependent interaction occurs at postsynapses , we used the phosphomimetic mutant of PIP5K g 661 , VC - PIP5K - S645E , in which Glu replaced Ser at 645 . The BiFC assay using VN - b 2 ear and VC - PIP5K - S645E revealed no Venus ﬂuorescent puncta after NMDA treatment in hippocampal neurons ( Figures 3C and 3G ) . When dephosphorylation was inhibited by FK520 ( 1 m M ) or okadaic acid ( 1 m M ) , the NMDA - induced formation of Venus ﬂuorescent puncta was signiﬁcantly reduced in neurons expressing VN - b 2 ear and VC - PIP5K - WT ( Figures 3F and 3G ) . Because Ser645 of PIP5K g 661 is phosphorylated by Cdk5 ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) , we performed the BiFC assay in the pres - ence of a Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine . The NMDA - induced formation of Venus ﬂuorescent puncta in neurons expressing VN - b 2 ear and VC - PIP5K - WT was signiﬁcantly increased by olomoucine ( Figures S4B and S4C ) . Together , these results conﬁrm that the emergence of Venus ﬂuorescent puncta re - ﬂects speciﬁc interaction between b 2 adaptin and PIP5K g 661 . They also indicate that the NMDA - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 at Ser 645 plays an essential role in its associ - ation with AP - 2 at postsynapses . In contrast , immunoblot analysis of the cell lysates at 5 min after NMDA application showed that only approximately 35 % of PI5K g 661 was de - phosphorylated compared to the maximum dephosphorylation level ( Figure 2C ) . The rapid emergence of the BiFC signal may be caused by the high sensitivity of ﬂuorescence detection ( Kerppola , 2009 ) in spines , whereas the immunoblot assay reﬂects total endogenous PIP5K g 661 . The dephosphorylated form of PIP5K g 661 was mostly observed in the membrane fractions , such as SV and PSD ( Figure 1F ) , probably because it is more tightly associated with the plasma membrane via AP - 2 . Neuron Activation of PIP5K Is Essential for LTD 138 Neuron 73 , 135 – 148 , January 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . Interaction of Dephosphorylated PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 Is Required for NMDA - Induced AMPA Receptor Endocytosis Association with AP - 2 activates PIP5K g 661 , leading to the pro - duction of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vitro ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) ; PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 triggers further accumulation of AP - 2 and other endo - cytic components at presynapses . Thus , we hypothesized that the NMDA - induced association of PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 ( Fig - ure 3 ) plays an essential role in NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis at postsynapses . To test this hypothesis , we ex - pressed the GluA2 subunit tagged with HA at its extracellular N terminus in cultured hippocampal neurons . As reported previ - ously ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Ehlers , 2000 ) , the surface HA - GluA2 , which is mainly localized to the somato - dendritic domain ( Matsuda et al . , 2008 ) , rapidly decreased following NMDA stimulation ( Figures 4A and 4E ) . When the GFP - tagged C - terminal fragment of PIP5K g 661 ( PIP5K - CT - WT ) was expressed , the NMDA - induced reduction of surface AMPA receptors was blocked ( Figures 4B and 4E ) . Similarly , the expression of the GFP - tagged dephosphomimetic mutant Figure 3 .

In contrast , expres - sion of GFP - tagged phosphomimetic mutant of the PIP5K g 661 C - terminal fragment ( PIP5K - CT - S645E ) failed to do so ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . GST pull - down assays conﬁrmed that wild - type and PIP5K - CT - S645A , but not PIP5K - CT - S645E , bound to b 2 adaptin ( Figure S5A ) . These results suggest that overexpression of the wild - type and dephosphomimetic C - terminal fragment of PIP5K g 661 interferes with the interaction between endogenous PIP5K g 661 and AP - 2 , thereby inhibiting the NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis . The C terminus of PIP5K g 661 is also reported to bind to the m 2 adaptin of AP - 2 ( Bairstow et al . , 2006 ) and talin ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , b 2 adaptin binds to clathrin through its ear and hinge domains ( Thieman et al . , 2009 ) and to hippocalcin , a protein that translocates to the plasma membrane in the presence of Ca 2 + during hippocampal LTD ( Palmer et al . , 2005 ) . Nevertheless , none of these interactions are reported to be affected by the dephosphorylation of the C - terminal domain of PIP5K g 661 . To examine the speciﬁcity of the dephosphorylation - dependent binding of PIP5K g 661 to b 2 adaptin , we performed GST pull - down assays . Although b 2 adaptin bound to GST - CT - WT and GST - CT - S645A with sig - niﬁcantly higher afﬁnity than to GST - CT - S645E , m 2 adaptin equally interacted with all GST - fused C - terminal fragments of PIP5K g 661 ( Figure S5A ) . In addition , although PIP5K g 661 binding to b 2 adaptin was speciﬁcally inhibited by the depho - phomimetic C - terminal peptide of PIP5K g 661 ( pep - S645A ) , the clathrin binding to b 2 adaptin was not affected by either pho - phomimetic ( pep - S645E ) or dephosphomimetic ( pep - S645A ) peptide ( Figure S5B ) . Furthermore , binding of CT - WT to talin was inhibited by pep - S645A and pep - S645E to the same degree ( Figure S5C ) . The interaction between b 2 adaptin and hippocal - cin in the presence of Ca 2 + was also similarly inhibited by de - phosphomimetic or phosphomimetic PIP5K g 661 C - terminal peptides and fragments ( Figures S5D ) . These results indicate that the dephosphorylated form - speciﬁc effect of PIP5K g 661 ( Figure 4 ) is likely mediated by its speciﬁc interaction with b 2 adaptin and that this speciﬁc interaction is required for NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis . PIP5K g 661 Activity Is Required for NMDA - Induced AMPA Receptor Endocytosis To examine the requirement of the kinase activity of PIP5K g 661 for NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis , we coex - pressed HA - GluA2 and GFP - tagged PIP5K g 661 ( PIP5K - WT ) or its kinase - dead mutant ( PIP5K - D316A ) , in which Ala replaced Glu at 316 ( Rao et al . , 1998 ) , in cultured hippocampal neurons . We found that the NMDA - induced reduction in surface HA - GluA2 was completely blocked by expression of PIP5K - D316A ( Figures 5B and 5C ) , but not by expression of PIP5K - WT ( Figures 5A and 5C ) . There was no signiﬁcant difference in surface HA - GluA2 levels between neurons expressing PIP5K - WT and Figure 4 .

Next , we performed an in vitro kinase assay of PIP5K g 661 after its immunorecipitation from hippocampal neurons treated or untreated with NMDA . The kinase activity of PIP5K g 661 from neurons treated with NMDA was signiﬁcantly increased ( Figure 5D ) . These results suggest that an NMDA - induced increase in PIP5K g 661’s kinase activity is necessary for evoking AMPA receptor endocytosis . To further conﬁrm the role of PIP5K g 661 in NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis , we employed a loss - of - function approach using vectors for shRNA and GFP . Immunoblot anal - ysis of the cell lysates with an anti - FLAG antibody revealed that two shRNAs directed against PIP5K g ( shRNA 1 and 2 ) speciﬁcally inhibited expression of FLAG - PIP5K g 661 , but not FLAG - PIP5K a or FLAG - PIP5K b , in HEK293T cells ( Figures S6A and S6B ) . Similarly , in GFP - positive neurons , endogenous PIP5K g 661 immunoreactivity was markedly reduced by these shRNAs , but not by a scrambled shRNA , whereas tubulin immunoreactivity was not affected by either construct ( Figures S6C – S6E ) . NMDA - induced reduction in surface HA - GluA2 was signiﬁcantly inhibited by these PIP5K g - speciﬁc shRNAs ( Fig - ures 6B , 6C , and 6E ) , but not by a scrambled shRNA ( Figures 6A and 6E ) . Furthermore , the inhibitory effect of shRNA 2 on NMDA - induced reduction in surface HA - GluA2 was rescued by coexpression of the shRNA - resistant GFP - PIP5K g 661 ( PIP5K g 661 res ) in hippocampal neurons ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . These results indicate that PIP5K g 661 plays a crucial role in NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis in hippocampal neurons . Figure 5 .

LFS - Induced LTD Requires the Interaction of PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 and Its Enzymatic Activity Finally , to examine whether LTD is regulated by similar mechanisms , we introduced the dephos - phomimetic pep - S645A , which speciﬁcally in - hibited the interaction between PIP5K g 661 and AP - 2 ( Figures S5B – S5D ) , into the CA1 pyramidal neurons via a patch pipette during LFS - induced LTD in hippocampal slice preparations ( Figure 7A ) . There was no difference in the excitatory postsynaptic current ( EPSC ) ampli - tude between neurons treated with decoy peptide and control phosphomimetic peptide pep - S645E . To examine the effect of peptides on the basal EPSC amplitude in the same neurons , we measured the EPSC amplitudes just after breaking into whole - cell mode and 9 – 10 min later , because it generally takes at least several minutes for peptides to diffuse from patch pipettes to synapses . We did not detect differences in EPSC amplitudes between 0 – 1 min and 9 – 10 min after establishing the whole - cell mode ( Figures S7A – S7C ; pep - S645A , 170 ± 14 pA at 0 – 1 min and 187 ± 18 pA at 9 – 10 min , n = 24 , p = 0 . 152 by a paired t test ; pep - S645E , 174 ± 11 pA at 0 – 1 min and 195 ± 13 pA at 9 – 10 min , n = 17 , p = 0 . 186 by a paired t test ; pep - S645A versus pep - S645E , p = 0 . 672 by a Mann - Whit - ney U test ) . In contrast , after LFS was applied to the Schaffer collateral , LTD was only observed in neurons treated with control peptides ( the EPSC amplitude at 25 – 30 min after LFS was 69 % ± 5 % of baseline ; Figures 7C and 7D ) , but not in neurons treated with a dephosphomimetic peptide pep - S645A ( 92 % ± 7 % of baseline ; Figures 7B and 7D ) . These results indicate that the interaction of PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 is required for LFS - induced LTD , but not for basal neurotransmission . To examine requirement of the kinase activity of PIP5K g 661 for LFS - induced LTD , we infected hippocampal CA1 neurons with Sindbis virus encoding GFP and wild - type ( Sin - GFP - PIP5K - WT ) or kinase - dead PIP5K g 661 ( Sin - GFP - PIP5K - D316A ) ( Figure 7E ) . LTD was signiﬁcantly inhibited in neurons Neuron Activation of PIP5K Is Essential for LTD Neuron 73 , 135 – 148 , January 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 141 expressing Sin - GFP - PIP5K - D316A ( the EPSC amplitude at 20 – 25 min after LFS was 89 % ± 6 % of baseline ) than those ex - pressing Sin - GFP - PIP5K - WT ( 64 % ± 4 % of baseline ; p = 0 . 028 , Figure 7F ) . These results indicate that the activation of PIP5K g 661 following its interaction with b 2 adaptin is required for LFS - induced LTD . DISCUSSION PIP5K g 661 and the Regulated Endocytosis of AMPA Receptors at Postsynapses In the present study , we demonstrated that NMDA receptor acti - vation induced the dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 ( Figure 2 ) and its association with AP - 2 at postsynapses in hippocampal neurons ( Figure 3 ) . NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis was blocked by inhibiting the interaction of PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 ( Figure 4 ) , by inhibiting the PIP5K g 661 activity ( Figure 5 ) , or by PIP5K g 661 knockdown ( Figure 6 ) . Furthermore , LFS - induced LTD was also blocked by inhibiting the interaction of PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 or by inhibiting the kinase activity of PIP5K g 661 in the CA1 pyramidal neurons ( Figure 7 ) . Binding to AP - 2 activates PIP5K g 661 to produce PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) , which plays a key role in recruiting AP - 2 to the plasma membrane ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ) . Indeed , NMDA treatment increased the PIP5K g 661 activity in hippocampal neurons ( Fig - ure 5D ) . Based on these ﬁndings , we propose the following model in which AMPA receptor endocytosis is upregulated at postsynapses during NMDA receptor - dependent LTD ( Figure 8 ) : ( 1 ) activity - induced Ca 2 + inﬂux through NMDA receptors dephosphorylates PIP5K g 661 by activating PP1 and calcineurin ; ( 2 ) the dephosphorylated PIP5K g 661 is recruited to the postsyn - aptic endocytic site by binding to preexisting AP - 2 and ( 3 ) is activated to produce PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ; and ( 4 ) produced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 further recruits AP - 2 and other components of the early endocytic machinery ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Rohde et al . , 2002 ) and stimulates the clathrin - dependent AMPA receptor endocytosis . Several other mechanisms have been proposed for the AMPA receptor endocytosis during NMDA receptor - dependent LTD in the hippocampus . For example , hippocalcin , a protein that possesses a Ca 2 + / myristoyl switch , binds AP - 2 and translocates to the plasma membrane ( Palmer et al . , 2005 ) . However , how the hippocalcin - AP2 complex is recruited to the endocytic zone remains unclear . Activation of the small GTPase Rab5 has also Figure 6 .

Rab5 regulates multiple steps on the endocytic pathway , such as invagination of the clathrin - coated pit , endosomal fusion , and downstream signaling ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . It also mediates the uncoating of AP - 2 from clathrin - coated vesicles by decreasing the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( Semerdjieva et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , cpg2 , a protein expressed in the hippocampus after increased Figure 7 .

Neuron Activation of PIP5K Is Essential for LTD Neuron 73 , 135 – 148 , January 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 143 neuronal activity , is localized to the postsynaptic endocytic zone and regulates AMPA receptor endocytosis during LTD ( Cottrell et al . , 2004 ) . Similarly , Arc , an immediate early gene transcribed after increased neuronal activity , enhances AMPA receptor endocytosis by binding to components of the later endocytic machinery , such as dynamin and endophilin ( Chowdhury et al . , 2006 ) . These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that activity - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis is regulated at the level of the endocytic process itself . Although all these processes are not mutually exclusive and are likely to work in concert , our model proposes an important form of regulation at the initial step of endocytosis : the recruitment of PIP5K g 661 to the plasma membrane to induce the clathrin - dependent AMPA receptor endocytosis . An alternative scenario is that AMPA receptor endocytosis is regulated by the lateral movement of AMPA receptors to the constitutively active endocytic zone , but not by endocytic steps : the application of NMDA does not cause an appreciable loss of clathrin from the dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons ( Blan - pied et al . , 2002 ) . Similarly , the activity - dependent endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor occurs via its lateral move - ment to preformed clathrin - coated pits in HeLa cells ( Rappoport and Simon , 2009 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is rapidly dephosphorylated by syn - aptojanin 1 to uncoat AP - 2 and other phosphoinositide - based membrane associations from clathrin - coated membranes ( Cre - mona et al . , 1999 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . Indeed , NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis is severely impaired in synaptojanin 1 null hippocampal neurons , indicating that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 metabolism plays an essential role in the regulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptor trafﬁcking ( Gong and De Camilli , 2008 ) . Therefore , ac - cording to this scenario , the NMDA - dependent activation of PIP5K g 661 by interaction with AP - 2 may serve as a mechanism for maintaining constant PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and AP - 2 levels during enhanced AMPA receptor endocytosis . Comparison with Regulated Endocytosis at Presynapses Elevated neuronal activities increase SV endocytosis at presy - napses . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays a major role in clathrin coat dynamics . For example , activity - induced SV endocytosis is severely retarded in Pip5k g null neurons , in which the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are decreased both in the basal state and after KCl stimulation ( Di Paolo et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , our ﬁndings demonstrate that in addition to its role at the presynapse , PIP5K g also has an impor - tant postsynaptic function . Several differences exist in the regulation of PIP5K g between the pre - and postsynaptic sides . The enhanced SV endocytosis induced by high KCl or direct stimulation of nerve terminals is largely mediated by Ca 2 + inﬂux through VDCC ( Cousin and Rob - inson , 2001 ) . Indeed , high - KCl - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g is blocked by VDCC blockers ( Figures 2E and S2 ) . In contrast , NMDA - induced Ca 2 + inﬂux ( Dayanithi et al . , 1995 ) and AMPA receptor endocytosis ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ) are insen - sitive to VDCC blockers . Similarly , NMDA - induced dephosphor - ylation of PIP5K g ( in the presence of TTX ) was dependent on Ca 2 + inﬂux through NMDA receptors , but not VDCC ( Figures 2E and S2 ) . Furthermore , LFS - induced LTD in CA hippocampal neurons was largely insensitive to a VDCC blocker nimodipine under our experimental conditions ( Figure S8 ) , as reported earlier ( Oliet et al . , 1997 ; Selig et al . , 1995 ) . Such dependency on NMDA receptors as a predominant Ca 2 + source may reﬂect the geometrical arrangement of NMDA receptors , which are highly expressed in spines ( Corlew et al . , 2008 ) , together with PSD - 95 and A - kinase - anchoring proteins ( AKAPs ) . Indeed , AKAPs play a crucial role in NMDA - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis by scaffolding speciﬁc protein kinases and calci - neurin at postsynapses in hippocampal neurons ( Bhattacharyya et al . , 2009 ) . Although certain VDCCs are expressed in dendrites , they may not be fully activated by the depolarization caused by NMDA receptor activation , which may inhibit VDCC activities ( Chernevskaya et al . , 1991 ) . The second major difference is that , whereas KCl - induced SV endocytosis and the dephosphorylation of PIP5K g are largely blocked by calcineurin inhibitors ( Cousin and Robinson , 2001 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ; Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) , the NMDA - induced dephosphorylation of PIP5K g was more potently in - hibited by PP1 blockers ( Figure 2D ) . Similarly , NMDA receptor - dependent LTD requires the activation of PP1 and calcineurin ( Mulkey et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) . PP1 activity is regulated by the calci - neurin - dependent dephosphorylation of Inhibitor 1 during LTD induction ( Munton et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , the activity of PP1 is regulated by its rapid recruitment from the dendrites to synapses during LTD stimulus ( Morishita et al . , 2001 ) . Such multiple regulatory pathways for PP1 activation may explain why calcineurin only partially inhibited the NMDA - dependent dephosphorylation of PIP5K g 661 . PP1 can dephosphorylate PIP5K g 661 in vitro ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , although serine 845 of the GluA1 AMPA receptor is one of the critical substrates of calcineurin and PP1 , we propose that Figure8 . ProposedMolecularMechanismforNMDA - InducedAMPA Receptor Endocytosis and LTD Induction Upon NMDA receptor activation , PIP5K g 661 is dephosphorylated by calci - neurin and PP1 ( 1 ) and interacts with AP - 2 at the restricted area of the postsynaptic plasma membrane ( 2 ) . The interaction with AP - 2 induces the activation of PIP5K g 661 , resulting in the local production of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 3 ) . The produced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 recruits endocytic components and induces AMPA receptor endocytosis , thereby inducing LTD ( 4 ) . Neuron Activation of PIP5K Is Essential for LTD 144 Neuron 73 , 135 – 148 , January 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . PIP5K g 661 is another substrate that may regulate the endocytic process during LTD . Various Endocytic Machineries at the Postsynaptic Site In addition to NMDA receptor - activated AMPA receptor endocy - tosis , there are other forms of activity - dependent AMPA receptor endocytosis in hippocampal neurons . The application of AMPA or ( s ) - 3 , 5 - dihydroxyphenylglycine ( DHPG ) , a metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR ) agonist , induces AMPA receptor endocytosis ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Snyder et al . , 2001 ) . Similarly , mGluR - dependent LTD could be induced in hippocampal slices using paired - pulse LFS . Unlike NMDA receptor - dependent LTD , mGluR - dependent LTD is independent of an increase in cyto - solic Ca 2 + or the activation of serine / threonine phosphatases , such as PP1 and calcineurin ( Harris et al . , 2004 ; Schnabel et al . , 2001 ) . Similarly , AMPA - induced AMPA receptor endocy - tosis is relatively insensitive to Ca 2 + inﬂux or calcineurin ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Lin et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , in these forms of activity - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis , the postsynaptic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 level may be regulated by a mechanism distinct from the PP1 - and calcineurin - dependent pathway . Indeed , during the prepa - ration of this manuscript , it was reported that mGluR - dependent AMPA receptor endocytosis is regulated by ARF6 activation through the ARF6 - speciﬁc guanine - nucleotide exchange factor BRAG2 ( Scholz et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , in contrast to DHPG , NMDA did not activate endogenous ARF6 in hippocampal neurons ( Figure S9 ) , indicating the existence of multiple path - ways leading to PIP5K g activation . Other ARF6 guanine nucleotide exchange factors , such as EFA6 and ARNO , are expressed at postsynapses ( Krauss et al . , 2003 ; Vitale et al . , 2002 ) . Because inactive ARF6 also binds to PIP5K g ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) , it may also serve to concentrate PIP5K g near the postsynaptic endocytic zone and to work with the PP1 - and calcineurin - dependent PIP5K g activa - tion pathway during NMDA receptor - mediated AMPA receptor endocytosis . Some forms of activity - induced AMPA receptor endocytosis may also be mediated by clathrin - independent mechanisms , such as caveolar and lipid raft pathways ( Frances - coni et al . , 2009 ; Glodowski et al . , 2007 ) . Further study on the regulation of AMPA receptor endocytosis is warranted to better understand the various forms of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plasmid Construction cDNAs for PIP5K g splicing variants , the C - terminal fragment of PIP5K g 661 corresponding to amino acids 448 – 661 , and their mutants were prepared as previously reported ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . cDNA for HA - GluA2 was prepared by PCR and Pyrobest ( Takara ) . These cDNAs were cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector . For the BiFC assay , cDNAs for the Myc - tagged ear domain of b 2 adaptin corresponding to amino acids 714 – 951 and HA - PIP5K g 661 or its phosphomimetic mutant PIP5K g 661 S645E were inserted into the pVenus ( 1 – 173 ) N - 1 and pVenus ( 155 – 238 ) C - 1 vector , respectively . For experiments with shRNAs , we developed an expres - sion vector containing dual promoters , CAG and H1 . cDNAs encoding GFP and shRNA were inserted downstream of CAG and H1 promoters , respec - tively . PIP5K g targeting sequences employed in this study are 5 0 - GGACCTG GACTTCATGCAG - 3 0 ( Ling et al . , 2007 ; Sun et al . , 2007 ) and 5 0 - CATCAA GACTGTCATGCAC - 3 0 ( a mouse version of Mao et al . , 2009 ) for shRNA 1 and 2 , respectively . The sequence for a scrambled shRNA was 5 0 - ATTGAC CATCACTCACTGA - 3 0 . For rescue experiments , four nucleotides were mutated in the region targeted by shRNA 2 without changing the amino acid sequence to generate PIP5K res . The cDNAs encoding GFP - PIP5K res and shRNA 2 were inserted downstream of CAG and H1 promoters , respectively . Culture of Hippocampal Neurons and Transfection Hippocampi dissected from E16 / 17 ICR mice were treated with 10 U ml (cid:2) 1 papain and 100 U ml (cid:2) 1 DNase in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium at 37 (cid:3) C for 20 min . The dissociated hippocampal neurons were plated on polye - thyleneimine ( PEI ) - coated plates or glass coverslips and cultured in Neuro - basal medium ( Invitrogen ) with B - 27 supplement ( Invitrogen ) and 0 . 5 mM L - glutamine . After 14 – 20 DIV culture , the neurons were transiently transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2 , 000 and used for assays of AMPA receptor endocytosis after 24 – 48 hr or for assays of BiFC after 19 – 26 hr . For shRNA experiments , neurons were transfected with shRNA expression vectors with or without the HA - GluA2 expression vector at 7 DIV and used for immunostaining or assay of AMPA receptor endocytosis at 14 DIV . Assay for AMPA Receptor Endocytosis Hippocampal neurons transfected with plasmids for HA - GluA2 and GFP proteins or shRNA were stimulated with 50 m M NMDA for 10 min and ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde without permeabilization for 10 min at room temper - ature . After neurons were washed with PBS and incubated with a blocking solution ( 2 % bovine serum albumin and 2 % normal goat serum in PBS ) , the surface HA - GluA2 was visualized with the anti - HA antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) and Alexa 546 secondary antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Invitrogen ) . To label the total HA - GluA2 , we then permeabilized the neurons , blocked them with a blocking solution containing 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 , and incubated them with the anti - HA antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) and Alexa 350 secondary antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) . The expres - sion of GFP proteins was also detected by anti - GFP ( 1 : 3 , 000 ) and Alexa 488 secondary antibody ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) . Fluorescence images were captured by a ﬂuo - rescence microscope ( BX60 , Olympus ) equipped with a charge - coupled device camera ( DP 70 , Olympus ) and analyzed using IPLab software ( Scana - lytics ) . Only the transfected neurons with well - developed spines were analyzed . For statistical analysis of the surface expression level of HA - GluA2 , we measured the intensity of Alexa 546 for the surface HA - GluA2 and normalized it to the intensity of Alexa 350 for the total HA - tagged GluA2 . The ﬂuorescence intensity on dendrites between 20 m m and 100 m m from the soma was measured . Immunoprecipitation To investigate the NMDA - dependent interaction of endogenous PIP5K g 661 with AP - 2 , we stimulated cultured neurons with 50 m M NMDA for 10 min and solubilized them in a lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl , 5 mM NaF , 2 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 4 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 , 1 mM PMSF , and 1 % Triton X - 100 ) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Nacalai Tesque ) . PIP5K g 661 was immunoprecipitated with an anti - PIP5K g 661 antibody conjugated with protein A sepharose ( GE Health - care ) . Proteins in the immunoprecipitate were blotted with anti - a adaptin , anti - b adaptin , and anti - PIP5K g antibodies . BiFC Assay For time - lapse imaging , hippocampal neurons were plated on 35 mm PEI - coated glass - bottom dishes ( thickness = 0 . 12 – 0 . 19 mm ; Mattek or Asahi glass ) andculturedinNeurobasalmediumwithoutphenolred ( Invitrogen ) , with B - 27 supplement ( Invitrogen ) and 0 . 5 mM L - glutamineas as described above for 16 – 20 DIV . The neurons were transiently transfected with plasmids for VN - b 2 ear and VC - PIP5K - WT or VC - PIP5K - S645E and cultured for another 19 – 26 hr . During imaging , the glass - bottom dish was kept at 32 (cid:3) C by a micro - scope incubation system ( Tokai Hit ) . Time - lapse epiﬂuorescent images were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope equipped with an Apochromatic 60 3 oil immersion objective ( NA 1 . 49 ) and an ORCA - II - ER camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) . Image capture and data acquisition were performed using NIS - Elements BR3 . 0 software ( Nikon ) . Image sequences were subsequently processed with NIS - Elements and ImageJ software ( 1 . 42q , National Institutes of Health ) . Neuron Activation of PIP5K Is Essential for LTD Neuron 73 , 135 – 148 , January 12 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 145 For immunocytochemical analysis , hippocampal neurons cultured on PEI - coated glass coverslips were transfected as described above . After treatment with 50 m M NMDA for 5 min , the neurons were ﬁxed , permeabilized , and blocked with a blocking solution containing 0 . 4 % Triton X - 100 . PSD - 95 and MAP2 were labeled with anti - PSD - 95 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) and anti - MAP2 antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) , respectively , and visualized with Alexa 546 secondary antibodies ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) . F - actin was labeled with rhodamine phalloidin . The numbers of the Venus punctate signals in the dendrites and the total length of the dendrites between 20 and 100 m m from the soma were measured . Assay of PIP5K g 661 Activity PIP5K g 661 activity was determined as previously reported ( Honda et al . , 1999 ) . For more detail , see Supplemental Experimental Procedures . Recombinant Sindbis Virus and In Vivo Injection The recombinant Sindbis virus for the expression of GFP and wild - type or kinase - dead PIP5K g 661 was constructed as described ( Matsuda et al . , 2003 ) . Under the deep anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of ket - amine / xylazine ( 80 / 20mg / kg ; Sigma ) , therecombinantSindbisvirus ( 2 . 5 m l ; titer , 1 . 0 3 10 8 (cid:2) 1 . 0 3 10 9 TU / ml ) was stereotactically injected into the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus of P14 – 21 ICR mice ( 2 . 0 – 2 . 3 mm posterior to the Bregma , 1 . 5 – 2 . 0 mm lateral to the midline , and 1 . 5 – 2 . 0 mm ventral from the pial surface ) . After 24 – 36 hr , infected cells were identiﬁed by the GFP expres - sion , and hippocampal slices were used for electrophysiological analyses . Electrophysiology Transverse hippocampal slices ( 300 m m thickness ) were prepared from P14 – 21 ICR mice or virus - infected mice according to the institutional guide - lines . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings were made from visually identiﬁed CA1 pyramidal neurons using a 60 3 water - immersion objective attached to an upright microscope ( BX51WI , Olympus ) at room temperature . The resis - tance of the patch pipettes was 4 – 6 M U when ﬁlled with an intracellular solu - tionconsistingof150mMCs - gluconate , 10mMHEPES ( pH7 . 3 ) , 8mMMgCl 2 , 2 mM Na 2 ATP , 0 . 5 mM Na 2 GTP , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , and 5 mM N - ethyl bromide quaternary salt ( QX - 314 ) ( 290 mOsm / kg ) . For the experiments shown in Figures 7B and 7C , synthetic peptide , pep - S645A , or pep - S645E ( 300 m M each ) wasaddedtothepatchpipettesolutiontobeperfusedpostsynaptically . The solution used for slice storage and recording consisted of 125 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 25 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , and 10 mM D - glucose , which was bubbled continuously with amixture of 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2 . Picrotoxin ( 100 m M ; Sigma ) was always included in the assay to block inhibitory synaptic transmission . To evoke EPSCs , we stimulated the Schaffer collaterals with a glass stimulating electrode placed on the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region ( 200 – 300 m m from the recorded neurons ) . The stimulus intensity was subsequently adjusted to 50 % of the maximal EPSC amplitude . For LTD experiments , EPSCs were recorded successively from CA1 neurons voltage clamped at – 80mV at a frequency of 0 . 1 Hz . After stable EPSCs were observed for least 10 min , LFS ( 1 Hz , 300 stimuli at – 40mV ) was applied . Access resistances were monitored every 10 s by applying hyperpo - larizing steps ( 2mV , 50 ms ) throughout the experiments ; the measurements were discarded if the resistance changed by more than 20 % of its original value . ThecurrentresponseswererecordedusinganAxopatch200Bampliﬁer ( MolecularDevices ) , andthepCLAMPsystem ( version9 . 2 ; MolecularDevices ) was used for data acquisition and analysis . The signals were ﬁltered at 1 kHz and digitized at 4 kHz .
