In this study , we demonstrate that amphiphysin 1 is essential for cellular phagocytosis and that it is critical for actin polymerization . Phagocytosis in Sertoli cells was induced by stimulating phosphatidylserine receptors . This stimulation led to the formation of actin - rich structures , including rufﬂes , phagocytic cups , and phagosomes , all of which showed an accumulation of amphiphysin 1 . Knocking out amphiphysin 1 by RNA interference in the cells resulted in the reduction of rufﬂe formation , actin polymerization , and phagocytosis . Phagocytosis was also drastically decreased in amph 1 ( (cid:1) / (cid:1) ) Sertoli cells . In addition , phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate – induced actin polymerization was decreased in the knockout testis cytosol . The addition of recombinant amphiphysin 1 to the cytosol restored the polymerization process . Rufﬂe formation in small interfering RNA - treated cells was recovered by the expression of constitutively active Rac1 , suggesting that amphiphysin 1 functions upstream of the protein . These ﬁndings support that amphiphysin 1 is important in the regulation of actin dynamics and that it is required for phagocytosis . INTRODUCTION Phagocytosis is a form of endocytosis in which large mole - cules are engulfed by the plasma membrane and internal - ized for digestion ( Greenberg and Grinstein , 2002 ; Nieder - gang and Chavrier , 2004 ) . In vertebrates , macrophages and testicular Sertoli cells are the predominant phagocytes . Phagocytosis contributes to removal of foreign bodies , bac - teria , and microbe - infected and apoptotic cells . Binding of these objects to the receptors , such as Fc (cid:1) receptors or phos - phatidylserine receptors , on the surface of the macrophage initiates membrane remodeling and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton . Cytoskeletal changes cause the cells to extend pseudopods that then engulf the objects ( Anderem and Underhill , 1999 ) . Sertoli cells participate in the maturation of germ cells and the release of sperm ( Russell et al . , 1990 ) . These cells are highly phagocytic and are responsible for eliminating the residual cytoplasm of spermatids ( Chemes , 1986 ; Clermont et al . , 1987 ; Morales and Clermont , 1991 ) . The phagocytosis is also used to remove apoptotic germ cells ( Shiratsuchi et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Kawasaki et al . , 2002 ) . Phagocytosis in Sertoli cells is initiated by the recognition of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) found on the germ cell surface by PS receptors ( Shiratsuchi et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Blanco - Rodriguez and Martinez - Garcia , 1999 ; Kawasaki et al . , 2002 ) . The class B scavenger family receptors SR - BI and CD36 are found on the surface of Sertoli cells where they function in PS recognition ( Shiratsuchi et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Kawasaki et al . , 2002 ; Gillot et al . , 2005 ) . In the testis , Sertoli cells express high levels of amphiphysin 1 ( Watanabe et al . , 2001 ; Kamitani et al . , 2002 ) . The expression of amphiphysin , along with that of dynamin 2 , increases with sexual development ( Watanabe et al . , 2001 ) ; thus , it is hypothesized that amphiphy - sin 1 may play a role in spermatogenesis . Amphiphysin 1 is found mainly in the neuronal synapse and in the testis . In the synapse , amphiphysin 1 acts as a linker between clathrin - coated proteins and dynamin 1 to assist in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Slepnev et al . , 2000 ) . Amphiphysin 1 and dynamin 1 are physiological binding partners , and they play a major role in the ﬁssion process of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Schmid et al . , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) . Amphiphysin 1 has three functional domains , a highly conserved amino - terminal region composed of (cid:1) 250 amino acids called the Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) do - main , a carboxy - terminal Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain that binds dynamin 1 ( David et al . , 1996 ; Wigge and McMahon , 1998 ) , and clathrin / AP - 2 - binding sites ( CLAP ) at the central variable region ( Slepnev et al . , 2000 ) . The BAR domain of amphiphysin 1 is a banana - shaped (cid:2) - helical dimer that senses highly curved membranes ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . It also contains an amphipathic helix at the amino terminus called N - BAR , which associates primarily with acidic phospholipids ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . This prop - erty enables the N - BAR proteins to induce membrane de - This article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

It has recently been reported that N - BAR – con - taining proteins , such as the Drosophila amphiphysin isoform or endophilin function as a linker between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . Phagocytosis requires actin dynamics ; the actin poly - merization underneath plasma membrane is thought to gen - erate the driving forces of pushing ( extension ) or pulling ( invagination ) of the plasma membrane through a linker protein ( Small et al . , 2002 ; Dawson et al . , 2006 ; Smythe and Ayscouh , 2006 ) . Amphiphysin has been previously interrelated with the actin cytoskeleton . Yeast amphiphysin isoforms Rvs 167 and Rvs 161 are involved in two actin - dependent processes , cellular polarity , and endocytosis ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Sivadon et al . , 1995 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . In neurons , amphiphysin 1 is colocalized with dynamin 1 at the ﬁlopodia formed in growth cones . The suppression of amphiphysin 1 by anti - sense oligonucleotides in the neurons decreases ﬁlopodia formation and leads to the collapse of the growth cones ( Mundigl et al . , 1998 ; Yoo et al . , 2002 ) . In the mature synapse , amphiphysin 1 localizes in proximity to actin cytomatrix ( Bauerfeind et al . , 1997 ) ; however , the precise role of am - phiphysin in actin dynamics is still not deﬁned . In this study , we analyze the function of amphiphysin 1 in actin dynamics during phagocytosis in Sertoli cells . We demonstrate a novel function for amphiphysin in the stim - ulation of actin polymerization in phagocytosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Three - week - old male Wister rats , 3 - wk - old and 20 - wk - old wild - type mice were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Supplies Co . ( Kyoto , Japan ) . Am - phiphysin 1 knockout mice [ amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) ] were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells as described previously ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ) . Twenty - Figure 1 .

The average area of the residual bodies in amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) is (cid:1) 1 . 8 times of that in wild type . Statistical signif - icance was determined by Student’s t tests ( * * p (cid:4) 0 . 01 , n (cid:5) 200 ) . ( F ) Primary rat cultured Sertoli cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 4 cells / coverslip ) were incubated at 32°C for 30 min with germ cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 3 cells / cover - slip ) pretreated with camptothecin . The cells were ﬁxed , permeabil - ized and stained with anti - amphiphysin 1 antibodies ( mab 3 ) and Alexa488 - phalloidin . Nuclei of the cells were visualized with DAPI .

PS - dependent phagocytosis in Sertoli cells . ( A ) Am - phiphysin 1 accumulates at phagosomes . Ser - W3 cells were trans - fected with amphiphysin 1 - myc . After 24 h of transfection , the transfected cells were incubated with PS beads at 37°C for 90 min . They were ﬁxed , permeabilized with digitonin , and stained with anti - amphiphysin 1 antibodies ( mab 3 ) ( top ) and anti - myc antibod - ies ( bottom ) and Alexa488 - phalloidin . Arrowheads indicate the in - corporated beads surrounded by amphiphysin 1 and polymerized actin . Bar , 5 (cid:3) m . ( B and C ) The association of beads with the Ser - W3 cells is PS and SR - BI dependent . Cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 4 cells on coverslips ) were pretreated with 0 . 25 mM liposomes containing PS or PC at 37°C for 10 min . Then , cells were incubated in presence of beads coated with PS - or PC - liposomes at 37°C for 180 min . The cells were then washed , ﬁxed , stained with DAPI , and analyzed by phase contrast microscopy . To block the binding of PS receptors to PS beads , cells were pretreated with anti - SR - BI antibodies or rabbit IgG as negative control at 100 (cid:3) g / ml for 30 min ( B ) . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m . The number of beads associated with the cells was determined using phase contrast microscopy , and it is presented as the number of the beads per cell . To block the internalization , cells were pretreated with Cyt D at 2 (cid:3) M for 30 min , and attached beads to the cells were analyzed . One hundred cells in 10 independent ﬁelds were counted in each experiment . All results are the mean (cid:7) SEM from three experiments . Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by Student’s t tests ( * * p (cid:4) 0 . 01 ) ( C ) . H . Yamada et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4670 week - old wild - type or amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) mice were used for harvest of cytosol and hematoxyline - eosin staining , and 2 – 3 - wk - old mice were used for primary culture . All animals were maintained in clean conditions with free access to food and water . They were allowed to adapt to their environment for more than 1 wk before initiating the experiments . Cell Culture Preparation of Sertoli cells and spermatogenetic cells from 3 - wk - old rats or mice was done as described previously ( Shiratsuchi et al . , 1997 ) . Cells were cultured at 32°C under 5 % CO 2 . Mixture of Sertoli cells and germ cells were plated on collagen - coated culture dishes . After 24 h , the residual germ cells were removed by hypo - osmotic shock in 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , for 3 min at room temperature . Afte r 2 d ofculture , the Sertoli cell - enriched culture consisted of (cid:1) 95 % Sertoli cells as established by immunoﬂuorescent methods for the cell markers , Mullerian hormone , or amphiphysin 1 ( Tran et al . , 1987 ; Watanabe et al . , 2001 ) . Cells were plated in monolayers and experiments were performed . Ser - W3 cells were cultured with DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37°C under 5 % CO 2 ( Prognan et al . , 1997 ) . Apoptosis of the germ cells were induced by treatment with 2 (cid:3) M camptothecin at 37°C for 8 h . Apoptosis was determined by analysis of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - annexin binding or chromatin condensation with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylin - dole ( DAPI ) staining ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . cDNA Constructs and Transfection The cDNAs encoding full - length human amphiphysin 1 and its truncation constructs were prepared by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ampliﬁcation by using speciﬁc primers ( Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . Full - length amphiphysin 1 , amph 1 - 626aa ( (cid:8) SH3 ) , and 226 - 695aa ( (cid:8) BAR ) were subcloned into the plas - mid pEF - BOS - myc or pGEX - 6P vector as BamHI – EcoRI fragments . To pre - pare amph D322 - 386aa ( (cid:8) CLAP ) , amph D1 - 321aa was subcloned into a pGEX - 6P vector as a BamHI – EcoRI fragment . EcoRI - EcoRI fragments contain - ing amph 387 - 695aa were then inserted into the EcoRI site . Amph D322 - 386aa ( (cid:8) CLAP ) was subcloned into a pEF - BOS - myc vector as BamHI – EcoRI frag - ments . Full - length amphiphysin 1 containing the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites was subcloned into a pEGFP - C1 vector ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) . The nucleotide sequences of the constructs were veriﬁed using DNA sequence analysis . The plasmids pEF - BOS - myc - N17Rac1 , V12Rac1 , N17Cdc42 , and N17Rho were a gift from Dr . Toshiki Itoh ( Kobe University , Japan ) . The constructs were transfected into the cells using a Lipofectamine 2000 trans - fection system ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . The efﬁciency of transfection was (cid:1) 90 % in Ser - W3 cells determined by the levels of green ﬂuorescence protein ( GFP ) expressed in the cells . Twenty - four hours after transfection , cells were subjected to phagocytic analysis . Preparation for Liposomes and Lipid - coated Beads Liposomes containing 70 % phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) and 30 % phosphatidyl - serine ( PS ) were prepared as described previously ( Shiratsuchi et al . , 1997 ) . For the actin polymerization assay , liposomes containing 46 % PC , 30 % PS , 20 % cholesterol , 4 % phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] were prepared by sonication as described in Ma et al . ( 1998b ) . To prepare the PS - coated styrene beads , liposomes composed of 30 % PS , 60 % PC , and 10 % biotinylated phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) ( Invitrogen ) were ﬁrst made by sonication in serum - free DMEM . Two milligrams of the liposomes was incu - bated with 100 (cid:3) l of styrene beads coated with streptavidin ( 2 (cid:3) m in diam - eter ; Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) fo r 2 h atroom temperature . The slurry was centrifuged at 5000 (cid:6) g for 5 min , and the beads were resuspended with 4 ml of serum - free DMEM . Phagocytic Analysis When indicated , cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 4 cells / coverslip , 22 (cid:6) 22 mm ) were pretreated with 2 (cid:3) M cytochalasin D ( Cyt D ) , or with the equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide for 30 min at 32 or 37°C in serum - free DMEM . To measure phago - cytosis , cells were incubated with 300 (cid:3) l of bead suspension on each coverslip and incubated at 32 or 37°C for the various time points . Because the kinetics of phagocytosis in Sertoli cell is relatively slow ( Filippini et al . , 1989 ) , cells were incubated fo r 6 h toensure internalization of the beads . Cells were gently washed four times with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 1 . 5 mM CaCl 2 and 1 mM MgCl 2 [ PBS ( (cid:3) ) ] . To distinguish between internalized beads and those attached to the cell surface , the later were labeled with FITC - annexin ( BioVision , Mountain View , CA ) , which speciﬁcally binds to PS . For this purpose , cells were incubated with FITC - annexin at room tem - perature for 10 min . Then , cells were ﬁxed with 2 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS ( (cid:3) ) . When necessary , cells were permeabilized with 100 (cid:3) M digitonin to avoid detachment of FITC - annexin from the beads . Mutant cells were determined by immunoﬂuorescence for myc . To quantitate phagocytosis , the annexin - positive and negative beads on the cell surface were counted using phase contrast and ﬂuorescent microscopy . The number of internalized beads was counted in 50 cells randomly chosen from more than 10 independent ﬁelds . Phagocytic indices were presented as the number of annexin - negative beads per Sertoli cell . An attachment index was also determined by counting the number of annexin - positive beads per cell . Microscopy Sertoli cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 4 cells / coverslip ) were ﬁxed with 2 % PFA / PBS ( (cid:3) ) at room temperature , permeabilized , and subjected to immunocytochemistry ( Krauss et al . , 2003 ) . The samples were examined using a spinning disk confocal microscope system ( CSU10 ; Yokogawa Electric , Kanazawa , Japan ) Figure 3 . PS - liposomes induce accumulation of amphiphysin 1 at rufﬂes in Sertoli cells . ( A ) Ser - W3 cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 4 cells / coverslip ) were incubated with 0 . 25 mM PS liposomes at 37°C for 10 min , and then they were ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained with anti - amphiphysin 1 antibodies ( mab3 ) ( left ) and Alexa488 - phalloidin ( middle ) . Vertical sections along a line in the overlay image ( right ) are shown in the bottom panels . The length of the z - axis is expanded by four times . Arrowheads indicate the rufﬂes . Note the colocalization of amphiphysin 1 and F - actin at the rufﬂes in stimulated cells . ( B ) Sequential images of Ser - W3 cells expressing amphiphysin 1 - GFP under PS liposome stimulation are shown . After Ser - W3 cells were transfected for 24 h with amphiphysin 1 - GFP , they were stimulated with PS liposomes , as described in A . Amphiphysin 1 accumulated at the peripheral membrane rufﬂes that originated at the lamellipodial edge ( arrowheads at 150 s ) . Vertical sections along with lines are shown in the bottom panel . In the vertical sections , the length is expanded by 4 times . Amphiphysin 1 in Phagocytosis Vol . 18 , November 2007 4671 Figure 4 . Amphiphysin 1 is required for PS - stimulated membrane rufﬂing , actin polymerization and phagocytosis . ( A ) Control siRNA or siRNA for amphiphysin 1 was transfected into Ser - W3 cells . After 48 h , cells were lysed , and 20 (cid:3) g of lysate was subject to Western blotting by using anti - amphiphysin 1 antibodies ( mab3 ) . Dynamin 2 , dynamin 3 , and (cid:4) - actin were used as the controls . ( B ) Control cells and cells treated with amphiphysin 1 siRNA were stimulated with PS liposomes at 0 . 25 mM at 37°C for 10 min . Cells were labeled with anti - amphiphysin 1 ( mab 3 ) ( left ) or dynamin 2 ( middle ) antibodies . The samples were analyzed by ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m . ( C ) The number of cells , which were positive for rufﬂes , was determined and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells analyzed . One hundred cells in 10 independent ﬁelds were counted in each experiment . All results represent the mean (cid:7) SEM from the three experiments . ( D ) Amphiphysin 1 RNAi inhibits actin polymerization during phagocytosis . Control cells or siRNA - treated cells were incubated with PS beads at 37°C for 90 min . Cells were labeled with Alexa488 - phalloidin . The samples were analyzed by phase contrast and ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy . PS beads are indicated by arrowheads and are shown at high magniﬁcation ( bottom ) . F - actin is observed around the bound beads in control cells ( left ) . The actin polymerization in siRNA - treated cells was barely seen ( right ) . Control cells H . Yamada et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4672 combined with an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 ; Olympus Optical , Tokyo , Japan ) and a CoolSNAP - Pro camera ( Roper Industries . , Sarasota , FL ) . The Z - positioning was accomplished by a piezo - electric motor ( Olympus Optical ) mounted underneath the objective lens . The system was steered by Meta - Morph software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Z - series images were taken at 0 . 2 - (cid:3) m increments . Vertical images were reconstituted from the Z - series of images by MetaMorph . For live imaging , cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 4 cells / coverslip ) were cultured at 37 or 32°C for 3 d oncollagen type I - coated coverslips ( 12 mm in diameter ) , and then they were transfected with human amphiphysin 1 - GFP at the concentration of 1 (cid:3) g per coverslip . Live - cell confocal time - lapsed images were taken using a spinning disk confocal mi - croscope system ( CSU10 ) combined with an inverted microscope ( IX - 71 ) and a CoolSNAP - Pro camera ( Tadakuma et al . , 2001 ) . Images were automatically captured every 30 s . Vertical images were reconstituted from a Z - series of images by MetaMorph , as described above . When necessary , images were further processed using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator software ( Adobe Systems , Mountain View , CA ) . Small - interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - mediated Interference Preannealed siRNA for rat amphiphysin 1 , and negative control siRNA were synthesized and puriﬁed by Ambion ( Austin , TX ) . The sequences for siRNA are as follows : rat amphiphysin 1 , 5 (cid:9) - GGCAGAUGAAACAAAAGAUtt - 3 (cid:9) for oligo 1 , 5 (cid:9) - GGUAUGCAGGAGGCCUCAAtt - 3 (cid:9) for oligo 2 , and 5 (cid:9) - GGAGAA - CAUCAUCAAUUUCtt - 3 (cid:9) for oligo 3 . Scrambled RNA that has no signiﬁcant sequence homology to mouse , rat , or human gene sequences was used as the negative control . The day before transfection , cells were plated in six - well plates ( 5 . 0 (cid:6) 10 4 cells / well ) . Two hundred picomoles of duplex siRNA was transfected into the cells using 4 (cid:3) l of Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . After 48 h , the cells were subjected to the different experiments . We conﬁrmed that all three transfections of siRNA for amphiphysin 1 were effective , and we obtained essentially the same results . Quantiﬁcation of Membrane Rufﬂe Formation Liposomes were added to Ser - W3 cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 4 cells / coverslip ) at 0 . 25 mM in serum - free DMEM and incubated at 37°C for 10 min . The cells were then washed with PBS ( (cid:3) ) three times . Stimulated or control Sertoli cells were ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained with anti - amphiphysin 1 antibodies ( mab 3 ; provided by Dr . De Camilli , Yale University ) or anti - c - myc antibodies and Alexa488 - or rhodamine - phalloidin . Cells with peripheral rufﬂes were char - acterized as cells with thick peripheral actin ﬁlament accumulation according to Suetsugu et al . ( 2003 ) . When counting the cells with rufﬂes , cells with free edges were selected . To quantify rufﬂing efﬁciency , cells that had no rufﬂes were scored as negative , whereas cells that had one or more rufﬂes were considered to be positive . The number of cells that were positive for rufﬂes was counted and expressed as a percentage of total number of cells analyzed . At least 100 cells in different areas of the wells were counted in each exper - iment . Preparation for Testis Cytosol Testis cytosol was prepared as described previously ( Ma et al . , 1998b ) . Brieﬂy , 20 testis of amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) or amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) mice were homogenized in 5 ml of XB buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA , 50 mM sucrose , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 1 (cid:3) g / ml leupeptin , 5 (cid:3) g / ml pepstatin , and 0 . 4 mg / ml phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ) , pH 7 . 4 . The ho - mogenate was centrifuged at 3000 (cid:6) g for 20 min and 10 , 000 (cid:6) g for 20 min . The resultant supernatant was diluted with XB buffer to 4 times in volume and centrifuged at 400 , 000 (cid:6) g for 1 h . The clear supernatant was carefully removed and concentrated to 4 times in volume in Centriprep - 10 concentra - tors ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . A ﬁnal concentration of the cytosol was 40 – 50 mg / ml . Monomer actin in amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) and amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol was determined to be equal as estimated by Western blotting . In recovery exper - iments , recombinant amphiphysin 1 or mutants were puriﬁed as described previously ( Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) , and added to amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol . In Vitro Actin Assembly Assay For visual assay for actin assembly , cytosol ( 20 mg / ml ) was incubated at room temperature with liposomes ( 0 . 15 mM ) and rhodamine - actin ( 0 . 4 mg / ml / coverslip ; Invitrogen ) . Samples were supplemented with ATP generating system ( 1 mM ATP , 8 mM creatine phosphate , and 8 U / ml phosphocreatine kinase ) , 1 . 3 mM MgCl 2 , and 0 . 1 mM EGTA . The mixture was examined by confocal microscopy . MetaMorph software controlled the microscope func - tions , and it was used for image processing . For quantitative analysis of actin assembly , pyrene - actin assay was carried out according to Ma et al . ( 1998b ) with slight modiﬁcation . Ma et al . ( 1998b ) ﬁrst mixed all the components except liposomes and then added the lipo - somes . The sequence was altered to ensure all the components mixed uni - formly in the cuvette . Brieﬂy , 125 (cid:3) l of XB buffer was incubated in a quartz cuvette at room temperature for 5 min . Then , an ice - cold mixture of liposomes ( 50 (cid:3) M ) and cytosol ( 8 or 16 mg / ml ) supplemented with 0 . 4 mg / ml pyrene - actin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) , 1 . 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA , and ATP generating system ( 1 mM ATP , 8 mM creatine phosphate , and 8 U / ml phosphocreatine kinase ) was added to the buffer . Pyrene ﬂuorescence was measured at 407 nm with excitation at 365 nm in an F - 2500 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer ( Hitachi , Tokyo , Japan ) with a 10 - nm slit width . Fluores - cent intensity of the buffer alone was subtracted from that of samples with cytosol and liposomes . Determination of Residual Bodies in Wild and Amphiphysin 1 - deﬁcient Mice Spermatogenetic stages in mice seminiferous tubules were categorized into XII stages , and the spermatids maturation was classiﬁed into 16 steps as described previously ( Oakberg , 1956 ; Abe et al . , 1991 ) . To quantify residual bodies in stage VIII , 30 seminiferous tubules each from amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) or amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) testis were randomly examined from 5 of amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) or amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) mice using hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) staining and light microscopy . Residual bodies and unreleased spermatids were observed in VIII stage , visualized with H & E staining ( Beardsley et al . , 2003 ) . The size of the residual bodies in stage VIII seminiferous tubules was determined and the average of the areas was calculated . The quantiﬁcation of the residual body size was determined on light microscopic images of H & E - stained samples . Twenty independent ﬁelds were analyzed by Mac Scope software ( Mitani , Osaka , Japan ) . Scanning Electron Microscopy Mouse primary - cultured Sertoli cells ( 1 (cid:6) 10 4 cells on coverslip ) were incu - bated with PS coated styrene beads at 32°C for 90 min . After incubation , cells were extensively washed with PBS ( (cid:3) ) three times , and one time with 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 4 . Pairs of coverslips were ﬁxed fo r 1 h atroom temperature with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer , containing 6 . 8 % sucrose ( Diakonova et al . , 2002 ) . Coverslips were then postﬁxed with 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer fo r 1 h at 4°C andwashed with 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer twice . After dehydration with a series of ascending concentrations of ethanol , the coverslips were coated with osmium tetroxide by using an ion coater .

Amphiphysin 1 in Phagocytosis Vol . 18 , November 2007 4673 RESULTS Amphiphysin 1 Is Involved in PS - dependent Phagocytosis The last step of germ cell maturation includes the elimina - tion of the spermatid cytoplasm before their release . This occurs at stage VIII of the seminiferous tubules . Sertoli cells use phagocytic mechanisms to internally incorporate the germ cell cytoplasm ( Clermont et al . , 1987 ) . The incorporated cytoplasm , termed residual bodies , can be seen in the Sertoli cells with hematoxylin and eosin staining ( Beardsley and O’Donnell , 2003 ) . We analyzed amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) Sertoli cells to investigate whether amphiphysin 1 is implicated in the phagocytic process of the residual bodies . In stage VIII of the seminiferous tubules , we saw round eosinophilic residual bodies adjacent to mature spermatids along the luminal surface of the tubule ( Figure 1 , B and D ) . The residual bodies were clearly larger in the amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) testis versus the wild type ( Figure 1 , B and D ) . Morphological analysis re - vealed that the average size of the residual bodies in amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) is (cid:1) 1 . 8 times larger than that of amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) ( Figure 1E ) , suggesting that residual body uptake or phago - some formation is reduced in the amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) Sertoli cells . Phagocytosis of residual bodies is triggered by the recog - nition of PS moieties on the outer surface of germ cells ( Blanco - Rodriguez and Martinez - Garcia , 1999 ) . A similar mechanism is thought to be used when Sertoli cells phago - cytose apoptotic germ cells ( Shiratsuchi et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Kawasaki et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , we examined the mecha - nisms of the phagocytic processes in the presence of apopto - tic germ cells . Apoptosis of germ cells was induced using camptothecin ( Fusaro et al . , 2003 ) , and the germ cells were placed on primary cultured rat Sertoli cells . As shown in Figure 1F , amphiphysin 1 and F - actin accumulated at the phagocytic cup formed on the surface of the cells . Consistent with previous report ( Kamitani et al . , 2002 ) , amphiphsyin 1 was absent in the germ cells . To further elucidate the func - tion of amphiphysin 1 in phagocytosis , we measured the uptake of PS coated styrene beads ( PS beads ) by primary cultured rat Sertoli cells , or by Sertoli cell lines . We observed an accumulation of endogenous or exogenous amphiphysin 1 and F - actin at the phagosomes in Ser - W3 cells , Sertoli cell line ( Figure 2A ) , and in TM4 cells , mouse Sertoli cell line ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . Ser - W3 cells speciﬁcally associated to PS beads , but not to phosphatidylcholine ( PC ) - coated beads ( Figure 2 , B and C ) . The association of the PS beads with the cells was abolished by preincubation of the cells with PS liposomes or with anti - SR - BI antibodies that recog - nize the ectodomain of the receptor ( Gu et al . , 2000 ) ( Figure 2 , B and C ) . In this experimental system , we conﬁrmed that phagocytosis is dependent on both PS and the PS receptor SR - BI . PS - Liposomes Induce Amphiphysin 1 - positive Peripheral Rufﬂes Phagocytosis requires actin polymerization , which causes dynamic membrane remodeling to form the characteristic membrane rufﬂing and pseudopods ( Caron and Hall , 1998 ; Anderem and Underhill , 1999 ) . We examined rufﬂe forma - tion in PS liposome - stimulated Sertoli cells . The rufﬂes were readily observed as actin - rich protrusions at the cell periph - ery ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) . Approximately half of the Ser - W3 cells formed rufﬂes upon liposomal stimulation ( Figures 3 and 4C ) . Vertical sectioning revealed that both amphiphysin 1 and the actin ﬁlaments were colocalized at the tip of leading edge of the rufﬂes ( Figure 3A ) . In contrast , PC lipo - somes had no effect on cellular membranes ( data not shown ) . Time - lapsed observations of amphiphysin 1 - GFP revealed that amphiphysin 1 - positive peripheral rufﬂes were visible within 60 s after the application of the PS liposomes . These peripheral rufﬂes occasionally bent up and moved backward as described previously ( Figure 3B ; Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) . To test the possibility that amphiphysin 1 might function in rufﬂe formation , endogenous amphiphysin 1 was knocked down in Ser - W3 cells by RNAi , and the cells were studied for both PS - dependent membrane changes and phagocytosis . The expression of amphiphysin 1 was de - creased by (cid:1) 95 % by the RNAi . The expression of dynamin 2 was decreased by (cid:1) 20 % , and expression of dynamin 3 and (cid:4) - actin was unaffected ( Figure 4A ) . Depletion of amphiphy - sin 1 in Sertoli cells by RNAi caused smaller cell shape and slight cell detachment . In the siRNA - treated Sertoli cells , both localization of clathrin and transferrin uptake were unchanged , suggesting that depletion of amphiphysin 1 does not affect on clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Supple - mental Figure 2 ) . Stimulation of control cells with PS lipo - somes for 10 min resulted in the formation of apparent rufﬂes , which accumulated amphiphysin 1 and dynamin 2 ( Figure 4B ) , whereas rufﬂe formation in the siRNA - treated cells decreased by (cid:1) 90 % of control ( Figure 4C ) . Transfection of amphiphysin 1 cDNA into siRNA - treated cells restored the rufﬂe formation ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . We then examined actin polymerization during uptake of the PS beads . In the control cells , PS beads were associated with the membranes , and they were surrounded by F - actin . In contrast , F - actin was present much less around the beads in the siRNA - treated cells ( Figure 4D ) . As expected , PS - dependent phagocytosis in siRNA - treated cells was reduced to 15 % of the control ( Figure 4 , E and F ) . The role of amphiphysin 1 in PS - dependent phagocytosis was also conﬁrmed using primary cultured Sertoli cells from amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) mice . In the amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cells , the number of PS beads attached on the cell surface was unchanged compared with that in the wild type , but uptake of the beads was decreased by 80 % in amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cells ( Figure 4G ) . Electron scanning microscopy revealed that wild - type Sertoli cells engulfed the PS beads through membrane extension ( Figure 4H ) . In contrast , PS beads attached to amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) Sertoli cells were rarely engulfed by the plasma membrane ( Figure 4I ) . Similarly phagocytic cup formation was not observed in Cyt D - treated wild - type Sertoli cells ( Figure 4J ) . These results indicate that amphiphysin 1 is required for the actin po - lymerization that causes membrane deformation at the early stage of PS - dependent phagocytosis . Overexpression of BAR Deletion Mutant Inhibits the Membrane Rufﬂing and Phagocytosis We hypothesized that a functional domain of amphiphysin 1 is required for the rufﬂe formation and phagocytosis . To test this , we used amphiphysin deletion mutants shown in Figure 5A . Wild - type and (cid:8) CLAP amphiphysin 1 transiently expressed in Ser - W3 cells were present as punctate pattern by immunoﬂuorescence , whereas (cid:8) BAR and (cid:8) SH3 were diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 5B ) . The expression of (cid:8) BAR in the cells strongly inhibited both PS - dependent rufﬂe formation and phagocytosis ( Figure 5 , C and D ) . (cid:8) BAR - expressing cells were unable to form exten - sions and tended to be smaller than cells expressing the other mutants ( Figure 5B ) . Expression of (cid:8) SH3 inhibited rufﬂe formation by (cid:1) 35 % compared with that of control , but the mutant proteins still localized to the rufﬂes ( Figure 5B ) . Expression of (cid:8) CLAP did not affect rufﬂe formation but phagocytosis was inhibited by (cid:1) 30 % ( Figure 5 , C and D ) . H . Yamada et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4674 Figure 5 .

Ser - W3 cells transiently expressing amphiphysin 1 - myc , (cid:8) SH3 - myc , (cid:8) BAR - myc , or (cid:8) CLAP - myc were stimulated with 0 . 25 mM of PS liposomes for 10 min at 37°C .

( D ) Effect of the truncation mutant of amphiphysin 1 on PS - dependent phagocytosis . Ser - W3 cells transiently expressing the wild type , (cid:8) SH3 , (cid:8) BAR , or (cid:8) CLAP mutants were allowed to phagocytose PS beads for 6 h at37°C . The number of internalized beads was counted in 50 transfected cells randomly chosen from 10 independent ﬁelds . The attachment index , deﬁned as beads bound per cell and phagocytic index , deﬁned as beads internalized per cell , was determined as described in Figure 4E . The mean (cid:7) SEM of the three independent experiments is plotted . Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by Student’s t tests ( * p (cid:4) 0 . 05 , * * p (cid:4) 0 . 01 ) . Amphiphysin 1 in Phagocytosis Vol . 18 , November 2007 4675 These results suggest that the BAR domain of amphiphy - sin 1 is essential for rufﬂe formation and phagocytosis , whereas the SH3 domain and the CLAP domain may have regulatory functions at different steps of PS - dependent phagocytosis . Actin Polymerization Induced by Liposomes Is Decreased in Amph 1 ( (cid:1) / (cid:1) ) Cytosol Because amphiphysin 1 RNAi and the expression of the amphiphysin mutants partly inhibited rufﬂe formation and phagocytosis , we examined the effect of amphiphysin 1 on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent actin polymerization using testis cy - tosol prepared from amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) or amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) mice . Actin polymerization in the cytosol can be induced by incu - bation of the cytosol with liposomes containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( Ma et al . , 1998ab ) . Actin polymerization of amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) and amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol was visualized by using rhodamine - actin . When liposomes containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were added to amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol , F - actin started to appear as bright spots within 5 min , and massive actin bundles were visible after 15 min ( Figure 6A ) . The polymerization was abolished by pre - treatment of the cytosol with Cyt D or by absence of the liposomes ( Figure 6A ; data not shown ) . Not surprisingly , there was less actin polymerization in the amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol ( Figure 6A ) . Supplementation of the amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol with recombinant amphiphysin 1 recovered actin polymerization to levels comparable with the amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol ( Figure 6A ) . To determine the actin assembly in a quantitative manner , we monitored the activity with pyrene - conjugated actin and polymerization - derived ﬂuorescence . Consistent with the Figure 6 . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 induced actin polymeriza - tion is reduced with amph ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) testis cy - tosol . ( A ) Actin polymerization was monitored by a visual assay in which 1 (cid:3) M rhodamine - actin was used to follow actin polymerization by ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy . The cytosol of amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) and amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) testis at a concentration of 20 mg / ml was prepared . Control cytosol ( top ) or cytosol pretreated with 10 (cid:3) M ( Cyt D ) for 5 min ( bottom ) were mixed with liposomes composed of 30 % PS , 46 % PC , 20 % cholesterol , and 4 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . To determine the recovery of activity , 2 (cid:3) M re - combinant amphiphysin 1 was added to the cytosol before mixing . After 15 min of incuba - tion at room temperature , the mixtures were analyzed by ﬂuorescent confocal microscopy . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m . ( B ) The liposomes - induced actin polymerization was measured using pyrene ﬂuorescence . Cytosol from amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) tes - tis ( red line ) or amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) testis ( black line ) were treated with 50 (cid:3) M PS / PC / Chol liposomes containing 4 % of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . As con - trols , the incubation was carried out in pres - ence of 10 (cid:3) M Cyt D ( green line ) , or in absence of liposomes ( blue line ) . The arrow indicates the time when the liposomes and cytosol were added . ( C ) Comparison of the actin polymer - ization activity between amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) and amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol is shown . To avoid effect of the initial peak , activity of F - actin formation at 100 s was measured by pyrene - actin ﬂuorescent intensity . All activities are normalized to that of the amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) testis cytosol . The mean (cid:7) SEM of three indepen - dent experiments is plotted . Note the reduced actin polymerization in amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol compared with the polymerization in the amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol . Statistically signiﬁcant differences from the value of Amph ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol are indicated by ( * * p (cid:4) 0 . 01 ) ( Student’s t test ) . ( D ) The liposomes - induced actin poly - merization measured by pyrene ﬂuorescence demonstrated the recovery of F - actin forma - tion by recombinant amphiphysin . Amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol ( black line ) was supplemented with 2 (cid:3) M recombinant full - length amphiphy - sin 1 ( red line ) , with (cid:8) SH3 mutant ( blue line ) or with (cid:8) BAR mutant ( green line ) . The incubation and the measurement of activity were carried out as described in B . The arrow indicates the time when the lipids and the cytosol were added . ( E ) F - actin formation after 100 s induction in amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol treated with liposomes containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 alone , with recombinant full - length amphiphysin 1 , with (cid:8) SH3 mutant or with (cid:8) BAR mutant was measured by pyrene - actin ﬂuorescence . The recombinant mutant proteins in the mixture were at a concentration of 2 (cid:3) M . The incubation with 2 (cid:3) M recombinant full - length amphiphysin 1 was carried out in presence of 10 (cid:3) M Cyt D as a control . All activities are normalized to that in amph ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol . The mean (cid:7) SEM of three independent experiments is plotted . Statistically signiﬁcant differences from the value of amph ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol are indicated by ( * * p (cid:4) 0 . 01 ) ( Student’s t test ) . H . Yamada et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 4676 visual polymerization assay described above , rapid actin assembly was induced by the liposomes in amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol ( Figure 6 , B and C ) . The polymerization did not occur in the absence of the liposomes or with pretreatment of the cytosol with Cyt D ( Figure 6 , B and C ) . Under the same conditions , the actin polymerization in the amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol was (cid:1) 25 % of that in amph 1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) cytosol ( Figure 6 , B and C ) . The addition of recombinant amphiphy - sin 1 to amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol was sufﬁcient to recover polymerization activity ( Figure 6 , D and E ) . However , the addition of (cid:8) SH3 and (cid:8) BAR proteins could not recover the actin polymerization in amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol ( Figure 6 , D and E ) . These results suggested that amphiphysin 1 regu - lates actin polymerization and that the regulation requires for both BAR and SH3 . Addition of (cid:8) BAR protein to amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol even decreased F - actin formation , suggest - ing the mutant might depolymerize or destabilize F - actin ( Figure 6 , D and E ) . Pathway of Amphiphysin - positive Rufﬂe Formation May Be Involved in Rac It is well known that actin polymerization and rufﬂe formation are stimulated by the activation of the Rho GTPase family ( Ridley , 2001 ; Cox and Greenberg , 2001 ) . We hypothesized that amphiphysin 1 may be involved in the process of Rho GTPase family - dependent rufﬂe for - mation . As shown in Figure 7A and B , expression of dom - inant - negative Rac1 or Cdc42 ( N17Rac1 or N17Cdc42 ) blocked PS - induced rufﬂe formation by 85 and 65 % , respec - tively . Dominant - negative Rho slightly inhibited PS - depen - dent rufﬂe formation . Furthermore , endogenous Rac 1 and amphiphysin 1 colocalized to the rufﬂes in the PS - stimulated Ser - W3 cells ( Figure 7C ) . Amphiphysin 1 siRNA treatment inhibited both the recruitment of Rac1 to the membrane and rufﬂe formation in the PS - stimulated cells ( Figure 7C ) . The overexpression of V12Rac1 , a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 , in the siRNA - treated cells caused the recovery of rufﬂe formation ( Figure 7 , D and E ) . These results strongly suggest that amphiphysin 1 is involved in Rac1 - dependent actin polymerization and that it may function upstream of this protein . DISCUSSION In this study , we investigated the role of amphiphysin 1 in Sertoli cell phagocytosis by using knockout animals and cell Figure 7 . Rac1 is involved in amphiphysin 1 - positive rufﬂe formation . ( A ) Effect of dominant - negative mutant of Rac1 or Cdc42 on amphiphysin 1 - positive rufﬂe for - mation . Ser - W3 cells were transfected with myc - N17Rac , - N17Cdc42 , or - N17Rho . After 24 h of transfec - tion , cells were stimulated with 0 . 25 mM of PS liposomes for 10 min , ﬁxed , permeabilized , and stained with rabbit anti - myc antibodies , anti - amphiphysin 1 an - tibodies ( mab 3 ) . Asterisks show where there was ex - pression of mutant Rho GTPases . The rufﬂes indicated by arrowheads are enlarged on the middle panels . Note that the expression of N17Rac1 strongly inhibited PS - stimulated membrane rufﬂing ( left ) . Transfection of N17Cdc42 also caused inhibition on rufﬂe formation in response to PS - stimulation ( middle ) . N17Rho - trans - fected cells showed a slight inhibition of membrane rufﬂing ( right ) . Bar , 10 (cid:3) m .

Amphiphysin 1 in Phagocytosis Vol . 18 , November 2007 4677 culture . We demonstrated that amphiphysin 1 is required for PS - dependent phagocytosis in Sertoli cells and that the protein is crucial for actin polymerization during the pro - cess . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst indication that am - phiphysin 1 regulates actin dynamics . Amphiphysin 1 Is Involved in PS - dependent Phagocytosis in Sertoli Cells Phagocytosis in Sertoli cells contributes to removal of the residual bodies , which occur just before sperm release ( Clermont et al . , 1987 ) . In amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) testis , the residual bodies were prominent , suggesting that the phagocytic pro - cess is decreased . Consistent with this ﬁnding , the numbers of unreleased spermatids were increased in amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) testis ( our unpublished data ) . On PS - stimulation of cultured Sertoli cells , amphiphysin 1 accumulated at F - actin – rich structures such as phagocytic cups , phagosomes , or rufﬂes . Formation of these structures was abolished by amphiphysin 1 RNAi , causing a decrease in phagocytic activity . These results clearly show that am - phiphysin 1 is essential for phagocytosis and suggest a role of the molecule in actin dynamics . Although amphiphysin 1 functions in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in the neuronal synapse ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) , both transferrin uptake and clathrin localization in Sertoli cells were unchanged by RNAi ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) , indicating that the main cellular function of amphiphysin 1 in the Sertoli cells is phagocytosis . We demonstrated that the BAR domain of amphiphysin 1 is required for both PS - dependent rufﬂe formation and for phagocytosis . It has been reported that BAR domain is re - sponsible for homo - or heterodimerization of amphiphysins ( Wigge et al . , 1997 ; Friesen et al . , 2006 ) , sensing membrane curvature , ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) , and mem - brane deformation ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) . These characteristics of BAR domain might be required for rufﬂe formation and phagocytosis . It is possible that inhibition of rufﬂe formation by (cid:8) BAR mutant is indirect . Because (cid:8) SH3 mutant , which contains BAR domain partially inhibited the rufﬂe formation , sug - gesting that binding molecules via SH3 domain may be involved . In addition , because (cid:8) SH3 mutant still localized at rufﬂes , the mutant may form partially functional dimer with endogenous amphiphysin 1 . (cid:8) BAR mutant contains proline - rich stretch ( PRS ) , CLAP and SH3 , which can bind to func - tional proteins required for rufﬂe formation . In particular , the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 interacts with dynamin 2 , which has been suggested to be involved in formation of membrane rufﬂing ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ; Schafer , 2004 ) . In this study , expression of dynamin 2 was decreased by 20 % in amphiphysin 1 knocked down cells . Because amphiphy - sin 1 binds to dynamin 2 , some of free dynamin 2 may be degraded in the absence of amphiphysin 1 . It is unlikely , however , that the decrease of dynamin 2 contributes to the inhibition of rufﬂe formation . Because exogenous am - phiphysin 1 rescued rufﬂe formation in amphiphysin 1 de - pleted Sertoli cells . Furthermore , clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis was not changed in siRNA - treated cells , suggesting that dynamin 2 is still functional in the cell ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . (cid:8) CLAP inhibited by (cid:1) 30 % of PS - dependent phagocytosis . It has been reported that clathrin accumulates at nascent phagosomes to assist in the recycle of membranes and re - ceptors ( Aggeler and Werb , 1982 ) , and the CLAP domain may contribute to this process . Amphiphysin 2m , an isoform lacking a CLAP domain , has known functions in phagocy - tosis in macrophages ( Gold et al . , 2000 ) , suggesting the pres - ence of different phagocytic pathway in this cell type . Amphiphysin 1 Regulates Actin Polymerization Phagocytosis involves actin dynamics regulated by the Rho GTPase family ( Cox et al . , 1997 ; Tolias et al . , 2000 ; Bokoch , 2005 ) . In the rufﬂing area , an increased production of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 activates the Rho GTPase family proteins , such as Cdc42 or Rac ( Czech , 2000 ) . These in turn stimulate actin polymerization by the Arp 2 / 3 complex and the WASP family ( Chimini and Chavrier , 2000 ) . As shown in Figure 6 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced F - actin formation was signiﬁcantly re - duced in the amph 1 ( (cid:2) / (cid:2) ) cytosol . This effect was restored by the addition of recombinant full - length amphiphysin 1 , but not by (cid:8) BAR or (cid:8) SH3 , suggesting that BAR and SH3 domain are necessary for recruitment of amphiphysin 1 to membrane , and for recruitment of its binding proteins re - quired for F - actin formation , respectively . It has been reported that dynamin 2 is involved in actin dynamics as well as rufﬂe formation ( Kruchten and McNiven , 2006 ) . Dynamin 2 binds to cortactin , which speciﬁcally binds to F - actin ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ; Schafer , 2004 ) . Furthermore , dynamin 2 interacts with Rac1 and has been implicated both in the formation of rufﬂes ( Krueger et al . , 2003 ) and in the regulation of the localization of intracellular Rac1 ( Schlunck et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , Drosophila amphiphysin interacts with neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein , and this interaction is necessary for the morphogenesis of rhab - domere microvilli ( Zelhof and Hardy , 2004 ) . Thus , am - phiphysin 1 may indirectly function on actin dynamics . The dominant - negative mutant of Rac1 or Cdc42 abol - ished the formation of amphiphysin 1 - positive rufﬂes . In addition , amphiphysin 1 RNAi inhibited rufﬂe formation , but constitutively active Rac1 expression in the siRNA - treated cells rescued it , indicating that amphiphysin 1 func - tions upstream of Rac1 . Consistently , amphiphysin 1 is known to bind to the proline - rich domains of RICH - 1 , a RhoGAP protein ( Richnau et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , direct binding of the yeast amphiphysin homologue RVS to actin has been shown in a yeast two - hybrid system ( Amberg et al . , 1995 ) . In conclusion , we have demonstrated that amphiphysin 1 participates in phagocytosis by changing actin polymeriza - tion activity in Sertoli cells . Amphiphysin 1 is implicated in the signaling pathway that involves Rac1 and Cdc42 . The precise role of amphiphysin 1 in the actin – regulatory signal cascade should to be elucidated with further studies .
