Rho GTPases have been shown to regulate three separate signal transduction pathways , linking plasma membrane receptors to the assembly of distinct actin ﬁlament structures . Here , we examined the role of Rho GTPases on the interaction between different T . cruzi infective forms of strains from the two major phylogenetic lineages with nonpolarized MDCK cells transfected with different Rho GTPase constructs . We compared the infectivity of amastigotes isolated from infected cells ( intracellular amastigotes ) with forms generated from the axenic differentiation of trypomastigotes ( extracellular amastigotes ) , and also with metacyclic trypomastigotes . No detectable effect of GTPase expression was observed on metacyclic trypomastigote invasion and parasites of Y and CL ( T . cruzi II ) strains invaded to similar degrees all MDCK transfectants , and were more infective than either G or Tulahuen ( T . cruzi I ) strains . Intracellular amastigotes were complement sensitive and showed very low infectivity towards the different transfectants regardless of the parasite strain . Complement - resistant T . cruzi I extracellular amastigotes , especially of the G strain , were more infective than T . cruzi II parasites , particularly for the Rac1V12 constitutively active GTPase transfectant . The fact that in Rac1N17 dominant - negative cells , the invasion of G strain extracellular amastigotes was speciﬁcally inhibited suggested an important role for Rac1 in this process . © 2004 Elsevier SAS .

Introduction Trypanosoma cruzi is a ﬂagellated protozoan parasite and etiologic agent of Chagas’ disease , endemic throughout South and Central America . Recent studies with different T . cruzi isolates have grouped the parasite in at least two major phylogenetic lineages : T . cruzi I linked to the sylvatic cycle of the parasite and other mammalian hosts and T . cruzi II associated with the domestic cycle and human disease [ 1 – 3 ] . Besides the different genetic markers , T . cruzi I and II infective forms have distinct infectivity and engage charac - teristic signaling pathways upon invasion of cultured cells [ 4 ] . T . cruzi undergoes a biphasic life cycle , comprised of several distinct developmental stages in both the reduviid insect vector and the mammalian host . In the insect vector , the ﬂagellated epimastigote proliferates in the midgut before differentiating into the nondividing , infective , metacyclic trypomastigotes found in the vector’s hindgut . Following its introduction into the mammalian body , the parasite infects host cells , differentiates into amastigotes , and begins to rep - licate in the cytosol of the infected cell . Amastigotes then develop into nondividing trypomastigotes that , upon cell lysis , may either initiate another round of infection or be taken up by the reduviid vector during a blood meal [ 5 ] . Amastigotes may occasionally be found extracellularly de - rived from the premature lysis of infected cells [ 6 – 9 ] or through extracellular differentiation of trypomastigotes [ 10 , 11 ] , and can invade professional or nonprofessional ph - agocytes , where they survive and sustain the parasite’s life cycle [ 6 – 8 , 11 – 13 ] . * Corresponding author .

Moreover , it has long been recognized that trypomastig - otes , the classical infective forms of T . cruzi , display marker complement resistance that has been associated with their infectivity [ 19 , 20 ] . Although previous results from the litera - ture have provided conﬂicting evidence regarding the infec - tivity of T . cruzi intracellular amastigotes [ 9 , 12 , 21 , 22 ] , re - sults indicate that infective extracellular amastigotes resist antibody - independent complement lysis [ 23 ] . In spite of re - ports comparing surface antigen expression by T . cruzi amastigotes obtained through distinct procedures [ 18 , 24 ] , there has been no direct comparison between intracellular and extracellular forms regarding their complement resis - tance and infectivity . Furthermore , despite intense studies on trypomastigote penetration , relatively little is known about the mechanism involved in the invasion of cultured cells by amastigotes . We have seen in a previous work , that G strain ( T . cruzi I ) extracellular amastigotes are able to infect HeLa cells by interacting with microvilli on the dorsal surface of these cells [ 13 ] . By contrast , trypomastigotes preferentially enter HeLa cells at the edges , showing that the different forms of the parasite interact with speciﬁc regions of the cell surface [ 13 , 25 ] . Evidence has been provided [ 26 ] that extracellular amastigotes utilize mannose receptors to infect professional phagocytes . Moreover , host cell surface glycoprotein sialyla - tion is important for trypomastigote invasion [ 27 ] but has no effect on amastigote entry [ 28 ] . Work from our group also demonstrated the importance of host cell cytoskeleton integ - rity for extracellular amastigote and metacyclic trypomastig - ote ( G strain ) invasion of HeLa and Vero cells [ 29 ] . Adhesion of invasive microorganisms to mammalian cells is often accompanied by cytoskeletal rearrangements that favor their entry . In recent studies , evidence has shown that T . cruzi amastigote invasion of cultured cells involves dis - tinct cytoskeletal rearrangements and signaling mechanisms when compared with metacyclic trypomastigotes [ 30 ] . Un - like trypomastigote invasion , which may trigger pseudopo - dium extension in HeLa cells [ 25 ] , the entry of extracellular amastigotes in these cells involves the formation of a discrete cup - like membrane expansion around invading parasites [ 30 ] . By contrast , in Vero cells that are devoid of microvilli , amastigote invasion is associated with the expansion of membrane lamellae that surround invading parasites [ 30 ] , suggesting that in each case , a particular set of microﬁlament - regulating GTPases might be speciﬁcally acti - vated . Rho - GTPases are molecular switches that control a wide variety of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells . They cycle between two conformation states : one bound to GTP ( active state ) that turns into the GDP - bound inactive state , when they hydrolyse GTP to GDP . In the active ( GTP - bound ) state , GTPases recognize target proteins and generate a response until GTP hydrolysis returns the switch to inactiv - ity . This general mechanism has been reﬁned throughout evolution , and mammalian cells contain several hundred GT - Pase switches . They are best known for their pivotal role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton , but their ability to inﬂuence cell polarity , microtubule dynamics , membrane transport pathways and transcription factor activity is probably just as signiﬁcant . When introduced into ﬁbroblasts , constitutively activated ( GTPase activity deﬁcient ) mutants of RhoA and Rac1 were found to induce the assembly of contractile actin and myosin ﬁlaments ( stress ﬁbers ) and actin - rich surface protrusions ( lamellipodia ) , respectively [ 31 – 33 ] . Later , Cdc42 was shown to promote the formation of actin - rich , ﬁnger - like membrane extensions ( ﬁlopodia ) [ 34 , 35 ] . Thus , RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 regulate three separate signal trans - duction pathways , linking plasma membrane receptors to the assembly of distinct ﬁlamentous actin structures . These ob - servations have been conﬁrmed in a wide variety of mamma - lian cell types as well as in yeast , ﬂies and worms . In order to evaluate the relative importance of RhoA GTPases in host cell invasion by different T . cruzi infective forms of distinct strains , we used MDCK cell transfectants that express vari - ants of RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 proteins [ 36 ] . Our results indicate that metacyclic trypomastigotes from G and Tu - lahuen strains ( T . cruzi I ) presented lower infectivity than Y and CL ( T . cruzi II ) strains for the different target cells , with no apparent speciﬁc requirement for GTPases . Regardless of the strain analyzed , intracellular amastigotes were not only susceptible to complement lysis but also showed very low infectivity towards the different transfectants . Extracellular amastigotes of all four strains were complement resistant and more infective than intracellular forms , and parasites from G strain infected transfected MDCK cells more efﬁciently than the other strains . Invasion was particularly high in Rac1V12 cells and was speciﬁcally reduced in the corresponding dominant - negative line Rac1N17 , suggesting an important role for this protein in this invasion process . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cell lines and culture Vero cells ( African green monkey kidney ﬁbroblasts , ob - tained from Instituto Adolfo Lutz , São Paulo , Brazil ) were grown at 37 °C in a 5 % CO 2 humid atmosphere , in RPMI - 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , streptomycin ( 100 µg / ml ) and penicillin ( 100 units / ml ) . These cells were used to maintain the in vitro T . cruzi cycle . The Madin Darby Canine Kidney ( MDCK ) cell line MDCK - Tet - OFF , which expresses the tetracycline repressor protein ( stably transfected with the pTet - OFF plasmid , from 461 A . B . Fernandes , R . A . Mortara / Microbes and Infection 6 ( 2004 ) 460 – 467 Clonetech ) was provided by W . James Nelson ( Stanford University , CA , USA ) with different constructs : Rac1V12 ( constitutively active ) ; Rac1N17 ( dominant negative ) ; RhoAV14 ( constitutively active ) ; RhoAN19 ( dominant nega - tive ) ; Cdc421V12 ( constitutively active ) , and the control line that was transfected with empty plasmid [ 36 ] . MDCK Tet - OFF cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum and doxycycline ( 20 ng / ml ) . For the expression of the recombinant proteins , the transfec - tants were grown in the absence of doxycycline for 48 h . 2 . 2 . Parasites In this study , two strains of each major T . cruzi phyloge - netic lineage were used : T . cruzi I , G strain , isolated in the Amazon from a marsupial of the Didelphidae family [ 37 ] and Tulahuen strain , isolated in Chile from Triatoma infestans [ 38 ] ; T . cruzi II , CL strain , isolated in southern Brazil from T . infestans in human dwellings where people were infected with T . cruzi [ 39 ] , and Y strain , isolated from an acute chagasic patient [ 40 ] . Intracellular amastigotes were isolated from previously infected Vero cells and puriﬁed in discon - tinuous metrizamide gradients [ 41 ] and checked for viability by incorporation with 35 [ S ] - methionine . Extracellular amastigotes were derived from the axenic differentiation of cell - derived trypomastigotes . Vero cell - derived trypomastig - otes were isolated from culture supernatants of infected cells by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min . The pellet was resuspended in liver infusion tryptose ( LIT ) medium [ 42 ] and incubated for 24 – 48 h at 37 °C , when at least 95 % pure extracellular amastigotes were obtained [ 12 , 13 ] . Metacyclic trypomastigotes were obtained by differentiation of stationary - phase hemocultures of infected mice , in LIT me - dium [ 43 ] . Grace’s medium was also used to obtain cultures enriched in metacyclic trypomastigotes , which were puriﬁed by passage through DEAE - cellulose columns [ 37 ] . 2 . 3 . Complement - mediated lysis In order to determine T . cruzi resistance to complement , 10 µl of a 10 8 parasites / ml suspension in RPMI medium were incubated with 30 µl of freshly drawn guinea pig serum ( devoid of lytic anti - a - gal antibodies [ 44 ] ) as a complement source . After 30 min at 37 °C , 10 µl of the mixture were examined under phase - contrast microscopy , and viable re - fringent parasites were counted . Metacyclic trypomastigotes of all strains are complement - resistant forms ( data not shown and [ 45 ] ) . 2 . 4 . Cell invasion assay MDCK cells were grown in the absence of doxycycline for 48 h to induce the expression of GTPase proteins . Host cell invasion assays were carried out as previously described [ 29 ] , by seeding parasites onto each plastic Petri dish con - taining 13 - mm diameter round glass coverslips with previ - ously grown 1 . 0 × 10 5 MDCK cells , at a 10 : 1 parasite / cell ratio . The dishes were immediately centrifuged at 2300 × g for 20 min at 37 °C . After centrifugation , unattached para - sites were removed by washing the coverslips with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) solution at 37 °C . Cover - slips were ﬁxed in 2 % glutaraldehyde for 90 min at room temperature . After three washings in PBS , coverslips were incubated with 0 . 138 M ethanolamine , pH 8 . 3 , for 30 min at room temperature to quench excess aldehyde groups [ 46 ] , washed with PBS , and soaked in PBS containing gelatin ( 0 . 15 % ) and NaN 3 ( 0 . 05 % , PGN solution ) . 2 . 5 . Indirect immunoﬂuorescence assay The coverslips were inverted for 1 h onto 20 - µl drops of anti - metacyclic trypomastigote monoclonal antibody ( Mab ) 3F6 , which recognizes the 82 - kDa surface glycoprotein ( used forY and CL strains ) , or Mab 1G7 directed towards the 90 - kDa surface glycoprotein ( for G and Tulahuen strains ) [ 47 ] . Anti - amastigote Mab 1D9 , which reacts with a carbo - hydrate epitope on Ssp - 4 [ 17 ] , a major amastigote surface glycoprotein , was used to detect amastigote invasion [ 29 ] . Samples were then washed with PBS and treated in the same way with a PGN solution containing the appropriate FITC conjugate and 10 µM DAPI ( 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride , Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) to visualize internalized parasites [ 46 ] . After being washed , the coverslips were mounted with glycerol / 0 . 2 M Tris – HCl pH 8 . 4 containing 1 % p - phenylenediamine to minimize quench - ing . Quantiﬁcation of parasite internalization was done under epiﬂuorescence microscopy , as previously described [ 13 , 46 ] , and was expressed by the following formula : invasion index = number of intracellular parasites× % of infected cells number of infected cells Triplicate coverslips were analyzed in each experiment , repeated at least three times . Invasion indexes were subjected to Student’s t - test . Fluorescently labeled samples were im - aged on a Bio Rad 1024 - UV confocal system [ 17 ] . In experi - ments carried out to check the expression of RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 GTPases , ﬁxed cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody a - c - myc ( Mab CE9 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) , since these transfectant proteins contained 10 additional amino acids at their N - termini , cor - responding to the myc epitope tag . Phalloidin - rhodamine ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , USA ) was used to localize F - actin , and DAPI to visualize parasites’ kinetoplast and nuclei [ 30 ] . 462 A . B . Fernandes , R . A .

Complement - mediated lysis of T . cruzi amastigotes When exposed to complement , intracellular amastigotes of all four strains were readily lysed , whereas extracellular parasites were completely resistant ( Table 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Regulated expression of GTP - binding proteins RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 in transfected MDCK cells To ascertain the regulated expression of RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 GTPases , we carried out indirect immunoﬂuores - cence with an anti - c - myc Mab , since the recombinant pro - teins contain a c - myc tag epitope . We observed that the GTPases were homogeneously expressed in the constitu - tively active transfectants ( Rac1V12 , RhoAV14 and Cdc421V12 ) , while in the dominant - negative transfectants ( Rac1n17 and RhoAN19 ) and control cells ( transfected with the empty plasmid ) , no expression could be detected ( Fig . 1 ) . 3 . 3 . Infectivity of T . cruzi G , Tulahuen , Y and CL strains’ intracellular amastigotes in MDCK cells transfected with Rho GTPases Intracellular amastigotes from G , Tulahuen , Y , and CL strains were tested for their capacity to invade MDCK cells transfected with RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 GTPases . The re - sults showed that intracellular amastigotes presented low invasion indexes for all parasite strains , and no signiﬁcant differences were observed among the transfected target cells ( Fig . 2 ) . 3 . 4 . Distinct infectivity of T . cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes and extracellular amastigotes towards MDCK cells transfected with Rho GTPases Both metacyclic trypomastigotes and extracellular amastigotes from G , Tulahuen , Y and CL strains were tested for their capacity to invade transfected MDCK cells . Meta - cyclic trypomastigotes fromY and CL strains invaded all the transfectants to comparable degrees , and the invasion in - dexes were higher than those of G or Tulahuen strain trypo - mastigotes ( Fig . 3 ) .

Mortara / Microbes and Infection 6 ( 2004 ) 460 – 467 MDCK cells , we observed that the number of parasites from G strain that invaded MDCK cells was about four times higher than that ofY or CL strains ( Fig . 4 ) . G strain extracel - lular amastigotes presented high invasion indexes on all transfectants examined , and invaded Rac1V12 ( constitu - tively active ) signiﬁcantly more than the other transfectants ( Fig . 4 ) . Conversely , the dominant - negative transfectant Rac1N17 cell line was less susceptible to infection by G strain extracellular amastigotes than control cells and the Rac1V12 line ( Fig . 4 ) . These ﬁndings indicate that Rac protein appears to be related to cellular invasion by T . cruzi extracellular amastigotes ( G strain ) . 4 . Discussion 4 . 1 . Infectivity of different T . cruzi infective forms towards MDCK cells : intracellular amastigotes , extracellular amastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes We have shown here that T . cruzi amastigotes isolated from infected cells ( intracellular forms ) are much less infec - tive in vitro to MDCK cells than extracellular amastigotes , conﬁrming our previous observations using either Vero or HeLa cells as targets [ 48 ] . Extracellular amastigote infectiv - ity correlates well with complement resistance , a well - known characteristic displayed by trypomastigotes [ 19 , 20 ] . Blood - stream amastigotes have been found circulating in infected mammals during the acute phase ( probably extracellular forms ) [ 49 ] , and it has been shown that the aﬂagellated forms of the parasite are infective both in vitro and in vivo [ 7 , 9 , 10 , 21 , 22 , 26 , 50 ] . Although previous results from the lit - erature are conﬂicting regarding the infectivity of T . cruzi intracellular amastigotes [ 9 , 12 , 21 , 22 ] , there has been no dis - pute that extracellular amastigotes are not only infective [ 8 , 11 – 13 ] but also resist complement lysis [ 23 ] . Besides morphological [ 14 ] and immunochemical [ 24 , 18 ] variations , differences in infectivity and complement resistance between intracellular and extracellular forms suggest that circulating extracellular amastigotes may be involved in a complemen - tary subcycle that sustains T . cruzi infection in mammalian hosts [ 51 ] . Studies from our group showed that extracellular amastig - otes of the G strain are consistently more infective to both HeLa and Vero cells [ 29 ] , as well as to CHO and sialic acid - deﬁcient Lec - 2 cells [ 28 ] , than the corresponding meta - cyclic trypomastigotes . In this work , we noticed that for MDCK cells and their transfectants , metacyclic trypomastig - otes of all strains are more infective than the corresponding extracellular amastigotes , supporting the notion that not only the infective form of the parasite but also the target cells are important for the outcome of the invasion process [ 29 , 48 ] . 4 . 2 . Cytoskeletal rearrangements in T . cruzi infective forms’ invasion : role of Rac1 in the invasion by extracellular amastigotes In the previous work in our laboratory , evidence was presented that amastigote invasion involves distinct cytosk - eletal rearrangements and signaling mechanisms when com - pared with that of metacyclic trypomastigote forms [ 29 ] . For instance , in Vero cells which are devoid of microvilli , amastigote invasion is associated with the expansion of MDCK Cells xe dn I no i sav n I Control Rac1V12 Rac1N17 RhoAV14 RhoAN19 Cdc421V12 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 G strain Tulahuen strain Y strain CL strain Fig . 2 .

A . Mortara / Microbes and Infection 6 ( 2004 ) 460 – 467 membrane lamellae that surround invading parasites , and trypomastigotes invade these cells by their borders [ 29 ] . In contrast , the entry of extracellular amastigotes in HeLa cells involves the formation of a discrete cup - like membrane ex - pansion around invading parasites [ 29 ] and sleeve - like pseudopodia around trypomastigotes [ 25 ] , suggesting that for each case , a particular set of microﬁlament - regulating GTPases might be speciﬁcally activated . In order to test which of the main Rho GTPases might be performing a role in these processes , we tested RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 MDCK transfectants [ 24 ] . Interestingly , high or low expression of any of the GTPases had no effect on metacyclic trypomastig - ote invasion ( Fig . 3 ) . Our results showed , however , that extracellular amastigote invasion was enhanced in the over - expressing transfectant Rac1V12 cells and was speciﬁcally reduced in the corresponding dominant - negative line Rac1N17 , suggesting an important role for Rac1 in this invasion process . The mobilization of mammalian cell GT - Pases is being disclosed as a widespread mechanism in mi - crobial invasion . The involvement of Rac1 in MDCK cell invasion by T . cruzi amastigotes parallels the results de - scribed for Salmonella typhimurium apical invasion of MDCK cells , a process that depends on Rac1 expression and activation , and also shown to be reduced in Rac1N17 cells [ 52 ] . In the case of S . typhimurium , it appears that secreted bacterial components such as SopE2 and SptP [ 53 , 54 ] are involved in Rac1 recruitment that leads to surface rufﬂing [ 52 ] . Moreover , in polarized cells , both Cdc42 and Rac1 facilitate S . typhimurium invasion through the basolateral domain [ 52 ] . Cdc , Rho as well as Rac1 are also involved in Shigella ﬂexneri invasion of HeLa cells transfected with GTPase constructs similar to those used here [ 55 ] . Contrast - ing with bacterial invasion , neither T . cruzi metacyclic trypo - mastigote nor amastigote invasion seems to depend on Cdc42 ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . This reinforces the notion that each microbe and infective form will engage a speciﬁc set of signaling components , from each host cell type , responsible for the formation of membrane expansions required for their inva - sion . In view of the morphological relatedness with Shigella and Salmonella invasion , it would be tempting to speculate that the membrane expansions formed during Vero cell inva - sion [ 56 ] might be related to Rac1 - driven protrusions trig - gered by an as yet unidentiﬁed amastigote component . Actin - rich membrane expansions were consistently de - tected in both trypomastigote and amastigote invasion of HeLa and Vero cells [ 25 , 56 ] . However , here we could not detect evident F - actin or GTPase accumulation at the sites of amastigote or trypomastigote invasion in MDCK cells . This observation suggests that membrane expansions involved in MDCK cell invasion are relatively modest if compared with those in the other cell lines . This poor membrane protrusion activity has been previously observed when the profuse pseudopodia formed in the course of HeLa cell invasion by trypomastigotes could not be detected in MDCK cells [ 25 ] . 4 . 3 . Infectivity of T . cruzi infective forms of the two phylogenetic lineages Evidence has been accumulating that T . cruzi exists in nature as a highly variable population . Over the last years , genetic markers have enabled researchers to group numerous parasite strains into two major phylogenetic lineages that display distinct biological proprieties . Our results indicate that metacyclic trypomastigotes from G and Tulahuen strains ( T . cruzi I ) presented lower infectivity than Y and CL ( T . cruzi II ) strains towards the different MDCK cells , with no apparent speciﬁc requirement for GTPases . These results are in line with the known infectivity of metacyclic trypo - mastigotes of these strains [ 57 ] . We had previously observed that extracellular amastigotes from the T . cruzi I G strain , which is poorly virulent and only causes subpatent para - sitemia in outbred Swiss mice , are much more infective to HeLa cells than forms of the more virulent T . cruzi II isolates like Y and CL strains [ 48 ] . The results obtained here with MDCK transfectants have provided , for the ﬁrst time , a comprehensive comparison between infective forms and parasite strains . Thus far , we have conﬁrmed the poor infec - tivity of intracellular amastigotes when compared with the extracellular forms , and the notion is strengthened that the infectivity of metacyclic trypomastigotes and extracellular amastigotes differs : T . cruzi II metacyclic trypomastigotes are more infective than T . cruzi I , whereas the opposite is true for extracellular amastigotes . Whether or not the differences in signaling pathways described for T . cruzi I and II metacy - clic trypomastigotes upon invasion of cultured cells [ 4 ] are retained in their extracellular amastigote counterparts , is a subject of our current research .
