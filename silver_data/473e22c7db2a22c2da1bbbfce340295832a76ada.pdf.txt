Cytoplasmic Cl − level is dynamically regulated by Cl − channels and transporters . It is well established that movement of Cl − across the cell membrane is coupled with cell excitability through changes in membrane potential and with water secretion . However , whether cytoplasmic Cl − plays additional roles in animal development and tissue homeostasis is un - known . Here we use genetics , cell biological and pharmacological tools to demonstrate that TMEM16A , an evolutionarily conserved calcium - activated chloride channel ( CaCC ) , regulates cytoplasmic Cl − homeostasis and promotes plasma membrane remodeling required for mammalian epithelial morphogenesis . We demonstrate that TMEM16A - mediated control of cytoplasmic Cl − regulates the organi - zation of the major phosphoinositide species PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 into micro - domains on the plasma membrane , analogous to processes that cluster soluble and membrane proteins into phase - separated drop - lets . We further show that an adequate cytoplasmic Cl − level is re - quired for proper endocytic trafficking and membrane supply during early stages of ciliogenesis and adherens junction remodeling . Our study thus uncovers a critical function of CaCC - mediated cytoplasmic Cl − homeostasis in controlling the organization of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micro - domains and membrane remodeling . This newly defined role of cytoplasmic Cl − may shed light on the mechanisms of intracellular Cl − signaling events crucial for regulating tissue architecture and organelle biogenesis during animal development . calcium - activated chloride channel | epithelial morphogenesis | phosphoinositide | membrane remodeling | primary cilia C a 2 + - activated Cl − channel ( CaCC ) , molecularly identified as TMEM16A ( 1 – 3 ) , serves important functions in excitable cells . Activation of TMEM16A - CaCC in nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons generates Cl − efflux , leading to membrane de - polarization and action potential firing ( 4 ) . TMEM16A - CaCC in the interstitial cells of Cajal plays a role in the generation of pacemaker activity in the stomach and intestines ( 5 ) . TMEM16A - CaCC in the auditory inner supporting cells enhances the excit - ability of cochlear hair cells ( 6 ) . In nonexcitable epithelial cells of the trachea , pancreas , mammary glands , and salivary glands , TMEM16A - CaCC is a major contributor of Cl − secretion . For example , mucociliary transport in the airways depends on cho - linergic Cl − secretion mediated by TMEM16A ( 7 , 8 ) . Intriguingly , genetic inactivation of TMEM16A in mice leads to perinatal lethality associated with early onset morphogenic defects in the tracheal and gastrointestinal tract ( 9 ) . In the hu - man genome , TMEM16A belongs to a group of 3 , 230 genes highly intolerant of loss - of - function mutations ( 10 ) , indicating that TMEM16A is essential for human survival . Little is known , however , about the cellular mechanisms that underlie CaCC - dependent tissue formation during mammalian development . In this study , we demonstrate that TMEM16A - CaCC is re - quired for maintaining a critical level of cytoplasmic Cl − . We further identified an unanticipated role of cytoplasmic Cl − in regulating microdomain partitioning of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , also known simply as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , one of the best - studied phosphoinositide ( PI ) species , on the plasma membrane ( 11 ) , analogous to processes such as phase transition of membrane lipids ( 12 ) . Paralleling changes in membrane phosphoinositide , intracellular Cl − level can also modulate endocytic trafficking and recycling endosome to provide membrane supply during early stages of ciliogenesis and junction remodeling . We propose a model in which the funda - mental role of TMEM16A in nonexcitable epithelial cells is to control the cytoplasmic Cl − level , which serves a key regulatory mechanism for the maintenance of membrane phosphoinositide homeostasis and membrane remodeling , and may have profound impact on downstream signaling events . Given that epithelial tis - sues constitute essential barriers and perform critical physiological functions in almost all major organs , our study provides important mechanistic insight into how Cl − channels contribute to tissue architecture and function . Results Consistent with a high level of TMEM16A expression in epi - thelial cells ( 13 – 15 ) , Tmem16a mutant embryos exhibited ab - normalities in the pseudostratified tracheal epithelium and cuboidal kidney tubules with complete penetrance ( Fig . 1 A – C ) . In particular , compared with wild - type littermates , Tmem16a − / − mutants had epithelial organs with enlarged lumens . Using whole - cell patch - clamp recording , we confirmed the deficiency of CaCC activity in Tmem16a − / − mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( Fig . S1 A ) . In mouse trachea , en face examination of the apical cell borders with phalloidin and tight junction marker ZO - 1 staining revealed a change of cell packing . In the control tra - chea , the epithelium underwent a transition from pentagons at E14 . 5 to hexagons at E18 . 5 ( Fig . 1 D and E ) . This transition from Significance Calcium - activated chloride channels ( CaCCs ) serve important phys - iological functions , including modulation of signal processing of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system . In this study , we uncover a previously underappreciated role for TMEM16A , an evolutionarily conserved CaCC , in regulating cytoplasmic chloride homeostasis and membrane remodeling events in nonexcitable epithelial tissues . TMEM16A - mediated intracellular chloride ho - meostasis can modulate the partitioning of membrane phosphoi - nositides and endocytic transport , providing a new mechanism that controls membrane dynamics , a key property of eukaryotic cell membranes important for numerous cellular processes in de - velopment and diseases .

The development of specific packing geometries of the epithelium is tightly regulated by a combination of cell junction dynamics and the rate of pro - liferation ( 16 , 17 ) . As proliferation is not disrupted by the re - moval of TMEM16A ( 9 ) , our data indicate that TMEM16A plays a role in promoting cell junction remodeling to achieve optimal cell packing during epithelial morphogenesis . To characterize cellular function of TMEM16A , we developed an in vitro cell model using mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells ( mIMCD3 ) that is amenable to pharmacological treatment with CaCC blockers ( Fig . S1 B ) . We further generated two independent Tmem16a KO mIMCD3 cell lines using CRISPR - mediated gene editing ( Fig . S1 C ) . Whole - cell patch - clamp recording confirmed the absence of CaCC in Tmem16a KO mIMCD3 cells ( Fig . 1 F and G ) . When cultured in 3D Matrigel , mIMCD3 cells can self - organize into polarized spher - oids that resemble their in vivo architectures ( 18 ) . In contrast to control mIMCD3 cells that formed organized spheroids with clear lumens , both Tmem16a KO mIMCD3 cell lines formed much smaller spheroids with disorganized lumens , although overall polarity appeared normal ( Fig . 1 H ) . Polygon distribution in Tmem16a KO spheroids showed fewer hexagonal cells compared with control ( Fig . 1 I and J ) . Treatment of control cells with benzbromarone , a specific TMEM16A channel blocker ( 7 ) , resulted in spheroids with abnormal lumen morphology similar to those formed by Tmem16a KO cells ( Fig . S1 B ) . Thus , genetic inactivation and pharmacological inhibition of TMEM16A - CaCC all led to abnormal spheroid architecture , suggesting that CaCC channel activity is important for epithelial morphogenesis . When expressed in kidney epithelial cell lines , TMEM16A - GFP was present on the plasma membrane , as well as on membrane protrusions such as the microvilli stained by phalloidin ( Fig . 2 A ) . Given the primary function of TMEM16A is to per - meate chloride across the plasma membrane , we determined whether TMEM16A activity can alter the cytoplasmic Cl − level in mIMCD3 cells using live imaging and a fluorescently encoded Cl − sensor as a readout for intracellular Cl − concentration ( 19 ) Tr Es Tr Es A B C E - Cadherin Smooth muscle actin DAPI w t T m e m 16a - / - w t T m e m 16a - / - w t T m e m 16a - / - WGA w t T m e m 16a - / - pe r c en t age pe r c en t age cell folds Phalloidin ZO - 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 10 20 30 40 50 wt e14 . 5 mut e14 . 5 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 10 20 30 40 50 wt e18 . 5 mut e18 . 5 * * * * * * * * ZO - 1 E - Cadherin DAPI 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 wt mut - 80 40 80 - 200 200 400 Tmem16a - / - ( pA ) ( mV ) wt Tmem16a - / - 0 400 800 ( pA ) - 80 - 40 40 80 - 500 500 1000 - Iono + Iono DIDS ( pA ) ( mV ) * * * - Iono + Iono Iono - + - + wt - 40 - 40 D E14 . 5 E18 . 5 E cell folds F wt H Tmem16a - / - I J wt Tmem16a - / - E - Cadherin pe r c en t age cell folds polygon distribution * * * * 200 ms 500 pA - 80 mV + 80 mV w t T m e m 16 a - / - + Ionomycin 200 ms 250 pA + Ionomycin G Fig . 1 .

As the fluorescence intensity of Cl − sensor is inversely related to the intracellular Cl − concentration , an in - crease in sensor fluorescence intensity correlates with Cl − efflux and a reduction of the cytoplasmic Cl − level . Bathing in low Cl − solution ( 5 mM Cl − and 145 mM gluconate , a large anion im - permeable to Cl − channels and transporters ) resulted in an in - crease of the Cl − sensor fluorescence intensity by 1 . 85 ± 0 . 24 fold in control cells , significantly higher than the 1 . 60 ± 0 . 31 fold increase in control cells treated with CaCC blocker , and the 1 . 54 ± 0 . 20 fold increase in Tmem16a KO cells ( Fig . 2 C ) . The difference of Cl − sensor intensity change between control and mutant cells may reflect the contribution of TMEM16A - mediated Cl − efflux , supporting a role of TMEM16A in epithelial cells for controlling intracellular Cl − homeostasis . Given the membrane localization of TMEM16A and its ability to modulate cytoplasmic Cl − concentration , we further charac - terized the cellular defects in Tmem16a mutants and looked for alterations in signaling molecules that might account for the Tmem16a mutant phenotypes . We began by examining phos - phoinositides ( PIs ) ( Fig . S2 A ) , which are central regulators in many aspects of the endo / exocytosis pathways in controlling tissue organization and function ( 11 , 20 – 24 ) .

PNAS | Published online December 11 , 2017 | E11163 C E LL B I O L O G Y P N A S P L U S PIs on the plasma membrane , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays an essential role in clathrin - mediated endocytosis and is mostly enriched on the plasma membrane ( 20 ) . A semiquantitative assessment of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 staining on the plasma membrane ( 25 ) revealed that in control cells , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was present in a punctate pattern ( Fig . 2 D and E ) , consistent with the presence of membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains ( 12 ) . The intensity of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains was reduced in Tmem16a KO cells and in control cells treated with the CaCC blocker benzbromarone ( Fig . 2 E ) . Those PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains were sensitive to membrane 5 ′ lipid phosphatase ( 26 ) , as recruitment of INPP5E to the plasma membrane strongly diminished the intensity of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains in control cells ( Fig . S2 B ) . The data indicate that TMEM16A - CaCC channel activity contributes to the heteroge - neous membrane composition and partitioning of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains of variable sizes . The amount of plasma membrane PIP 3 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 were also misregulated in Tmem16a KO cells ( Fig . 2 F ) , indicating a general role of TMEM16A - CaCC in regulating phosphoinositides homeostasis . We next determined whether TMEM16A plays a role in mod - ulating receptor - mediated endocytosis , which depends on the membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 activity . Both control and Tmem16a KO cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 - conjugated transferrin ( Trf ) at 4 °C for 30 min to allow saturated binding and to prevent internalization of surface - bound Trf ; unbound Trf was sub - sequently removed by washing with cold media . After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min , the intensity of internalized Trf in Tmem16a KO cells was about 40 % of that in control cells ( Fig . 2 G and H ) . With treatment of the CaCC blocker benzbromarone during the internalization period , Trf uptake in wild - type cells was about 67 % of that in control cells without blocker treatment ( Fig . 2 G and H ) . In control cells , the localization of internalized Trf strongly overlapped with that of Rab11A - GFP , a molecular signature that defines the juxtanuclear endosomal recycling compartment ( ERC ) and slow recycling endosomes ( 27 , 28 ) , and of pericen - trin , a protein that marks the centrosome and adjacent cen - trosomal materials . In Tmem16a KO cells , the amount of Trf colocalized with either Rab11A - GFP or pericentrin was reduced , and Trf appeared to be more diffuse within the cell ( Fig . S2 C ) . Thus , the lack of TMEM16A impairs Trf accumulation at the ERC near the centrosome , which may reflect the decrease of total Trf internalization in Tmem16a KO cells . In light of the ability of inactivation of TMEM16A - CaCC to impair the levels of membrane PIs and Trf uptake , we asked whether intracellular Cl − dynamics was linked to membrane PIs and Trf endocytosis . Assessed by membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 immunostaining , mIMCD3 cells cultured in low Cl − solution for 45 min showed redistribution of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains and induced the formation of large PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 positive tubular / ring - like structures near the cell periphery ( Fig . 3 A and B and Fig . S3 A ) , similar to the uncoated endocytic structures during massive endocytosis or macropinocytosis ( 29 ) . To de - termine whether changes in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in cells exposed to low Cl − and high gluconate were due to changes in the membrane potential , we replaced 145 mM gluconate with 145 mM I − , which permeates most Cl − channels including TMEM16A ( 30 , 31 ) and thus might alter the membrane potential differently from glu - conate . High I − treatment similarly induced dimmer PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains and large PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 positive tubular structures ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S3 A ) . Using a previously characterized PH PLC δ domain tagged to GFP ( PH - GFP ) ( 32 , 33 ) to visualize PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , we characterized the dynamics of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 during Cl − efflux by live imaging . Low Cl − treatment induced extensive ruffling around the cell periphery as well as PH - GFP positive structures on the membrane ( Fig . 3 C ) . Those structures were highly dy - namic , forming and disappearing , but became more stable to - ward the end of the 45 - min imaging period . The data suggest that the reduction in the intracellular Cl − concentration may account for changes in membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Low Cl − treatment for 45 min reduced Trf fluorescence in - tensity within the cells bathed in either gluconate or I − compared with cells cultured in control solution , but caused a strong ac - cumulation of Trf colocalized with Rab11A - GFP at the ERC , as well as Trf - positive and Rab11 - GFP positive vesicles at cell pe - riphery ( Fig . 3 D and E ) . Analyses of the kinetics of internalized Trf in response to Cl − efflux revealed that lowering intracellular Cl − can promote recycling endosome accumulation at the ERC ( Fig . 3 F ) and alter the time course of Trf receptor recycling back to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3 E ) . E - cadherin endocytosis and recycling are particularly important mechanisms for cell junction remodeling . Given the effect of Cl − efflux on Trf endocytosis , we determined whether low cytoplasmic Cl − could trigger E - cadherin internalization . In a preconfluent mIMCD3 monolayer , E - cadherin was mostly present on the cell membrane at the cell – cell contacts , colocalized with F - actin . Treatment of low Cl − solution containing either 145 mM gluco - nate or 145 mM I − induced formation of ruffled cell – cell contacts and internalization of E - cadherin into small vesicles . F - actin also became more diffuse and less concentrated on the cell – cell contacts ( Fig . 3 G ) . Thus , paralleling the changes in membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , low Cl − also induced abnormal accumulation of Trf at the ERC as well as internalization of E - cadherin ; the similar effects of high gluconate or high I − on E - cadherin and Trf recycling can be accounted for by alteration of cytoplasmic Cl − controlled by CaCC rather than channels on the recycling endosomal membrane . The effect of low Cl − on Trf trafficking and E - cadherin dynamics was reversible , as incubation of normal Cl − solution facilitated Trf clearing from the ERC in cells pretreated with low Cl − solution , and caused internalized E - cadherin to be reinserted to the junctions and the disappearance of ruffled cell – cell contacts ( Fig . S3 B and C ) . Thus , the effects on Trf endocytosis and E - cadherin dynamics in - volving recycling endosomes are specific to low Cl − and reversible by restoring normal Cl − concentration . Changes in membrane PI homeostasis and membrane remodel - ing in the absence of TMEM16A - CaCC may also affect organelles on the plasma membrane . We asked whether TMEM16A - CaCC – dependent membrane remodeling is required for the formation of cilia ( Fig . S4 A ) , which are key signaling and sensory organelles present on the apical surface in most if not all epithelial cells . Treatment of CaCC blocker at different times during spheroid formation demonstrated that the activity of TMEM16A - CaCC was particularly important at the initiation stage for both cilium and lumen formation ( Fig . S4 B – D ) . Consistent with the finding that vesiculotubular structures are enriched at the pericentrosomal area at the onset of ciliogenesis but not after cilia formation ( 23 , 24 , 34 ) , our data are in agreement with the report that TMEM16A - CaCC blockers affect ciliogenesis of cultured epithelial cells ( 35 ) . We next examined the morphology of primary cilia in wild - type and Tmem16a null mouse embryos by using the cilia marker Arl13b , a small GTPase specifically localized to the ciliary membrane ( 36 ) . Various epithelial cell types in the kidney , pancreas , and trachea exhibited significantly shorter primary cilia in Tmem16a − / − mutant embryos compared with those in littermate controls ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S4 A ) . En face imaging of E14 . 5 trachea by scanning electron microscopy confirmed that primary cilia were shorter in Tmem16a mutants , and fewer cilia were observed in mutants than in controls ( Fig . 4 B ) . By estimation the ratio of cell surface to cilia surface is close to 400 ( 37 ) . If a perturbation of endocytosis was sufficient to affect primary cilia elongation in cells lacking TMEM16A , we wondered whether such perturbation in membrane supply would lead to more severe defects in cells that form a large number of motile cilia . Immunofluorescence ( IF ) staining with acetylated α - tubulin and scanning electron microscopy revealed that motile cilia were less dense and appeared shorter in the mutant trachea at embryonic day 18 . 5 ( E18 . 5 ) , as if they had not fully emerged ( Fig . 4 E11164 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1714448115 He et al .

Thus , in the absence of TMEM16A , motile cilia exten - sion was impaired in the trachea epithelium . Consistent with the defects seen in Tmem16a − / − mutant embryos , primary cilia were much shorter in Tmem16a KO cell lines as well as in control mIMCD3 cells treated with benzbromarone and 1PBC ( Fig . 4 E – G ) . Thus , genetic inactivation and pharmacological inhibition of TMEM16A - CaCC all led to shortened cilia , highlighting a critical role of TMEM16A - CaCC in providing membrane supply during early stages of ciliogenesis . Given the effect of low Cl − on membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , Trf trafficking , and E - cadherin dynamics , we next determined whether modulation of cytoplasmic Cl − could reverse tissue and cellular de - fects of Tmem16a mutants . When Tmem16a KO cells were in - cubated in 75 mM Cl − , the intensity of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains was significantly increased compared with those mutant cells cul - tured in 150 mM Cl − ( Fig . 5 A ) . Further , exposure of Tmem16a KO cells to 75 mM extracellular Cl − induced Trf accumulation to the ERC ( Fig . 5 B and C ) . Thus , reduction in the Cl − level in Tmem16a KO cells can increase Trf uptake and recruit more recycling endo - somes to the ERC , thereby partially rescuing mutant phenotypes . We further tested whether this partial restoration of endocytosis and membrane PIP 2 may rescue defects of ciliogenesis and tissue architecture in 3D matrigel culture . mIMCD3 cells cultured in 150 mM or 75 mM Cl − formed cilia with comparable length . The diameter of control spheroids in 75 mM Cl − was smaller compared with spheroids cultured in 150 mM Cl − . Tmem16a KO cells , when cultured in 75 mM Cl − media , formed primary cilia significantly longer than those of mutant cells cultured in 150 mM Cl − , and the diameter of Tmem16a KO spheroids exhibited a 20 % increase ( Fig . 5 D and E and Fig . S4 E and F ) . When cultured in media with 75 mM Cl − for 4 d , Tmem16a KO spheroids contained more hex - agonally shaped cells , compared with the pentagonally packed spheroids cultured in normal media with 150 mM Cl − ( Fig . 5 F ) . Consistent with the finding that low Cl − promotes E - cadherin in - ternalization and that E - cadherin turnover at the cell – cell junctions promotes epithelial cell rearrangement , the cell packing defects observed in Tmem16a mutant embryos and Tmem16a KO cells could arise from a reduction in E - cadherin turnover due to com - promised Cl − homeostasis . To determine whether TMEM16A - dependent epithelial morphogenesis is primarily mediated through phosphoinositol signaling , we next assessed whether depletion of PIP 2 can exacerbate the cellular defects in Tmem16a mutants . At a micromolar concentration , wortmannin , a nonselective PI3K in - hibitor , can also inhibit PI4K activity , which is required for PIP 2 replenishment ( 38 , 39 ) . When incubated with 25 μ M wortmannin for 12 h , control spheroids appeared similar to those incubated with regular culture media . In treated spheroids , tight junctions , marked by ZO - 1 , localized normally to the apical surface of the lumen , while primary cilia , marked by Arl13b , showed comparable morphology and density ( Fig . S5 ) . In contrast , wortmannin - treated Tmem16a KO spheroids exhibited collapsed lumen and ectopic localization of ZO - 1 to the basal – lateral membrane . In the presence of wortman - nin , the fluorescent intensity of Arl13b appeared diffuse , indicating a stronger structural defect associated with the primary cilia ( Fig . S5 ) .

Consistent with a crucial role in regulating epithelial organization and ciliogenesis , the morphological defects of Tmem16a − / − mutants share common features with known human congenital disorders . For example , esophageal and tracheal abnormalities associated with TMEM16A inactivation are identical to those seen in Ift172 avc1 , a mouse model for ciliopathy and human vertebral anomalies ( V ) , anal atresia ( A ) , tracheoesophageal fistulas ( TE ) , and renal ( R ) and limb ( L ) anomalies , collectively called the VACTERL association ( 40 ) . The tubular atrophy and cysts seen in Tmem16a − / − mutant kidneys are markedly similar to those of nephronophthisis , a rare inheritable human kidney disease that primarily affects children ( 41 ) . Our data suggest that the activity of TMEM16A - CaCC in reg - ulating epithelial morphogenesis depends on its chloride perme - ation to modulate membrane phosphoinositide distribution and promotes endocytic trafficking , which controls apical membrane delivery and adherens junction turnover . Because changes of in - tracellular Cl − level can modulate the organization of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomains and transferrin recycling , and partially rescue Tmem16a mutant defects , our data suggest that the function of TMEM16A in tissue morphogenesis depends on its ability to permeate Cl − ions to maintain the cytoplasmic Cl − homeostasis . Within the cell , an optimal cytoplasmic Cl − level may provide an important regulatory mechanism for proper phosphoinositide func - tions and many critical downstream signaling events conducive for the formation of a stable epithelium . Given that electrostatic interactions are sufficient to organize PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and its interacting proteins into microdomains , it is possible that cytoplasmic Cl − provides an ideal electrostatic environment that favors the formation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micro - domains and interactions among PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding partners ( 12 , 42 ) . Alternatively , it is possible that Cl − may directly interact with enzymes that metabolize phospholipids or GTP - binding proteins such as ARF6 that can activate PIP5K to promote local PIP2 production ( 32 ) . With Cl − as the predominant anion , en - zymes may have evolved to form association with Cl − , which in turn can fine tune enzymatic output . Our discovery of the role of cytoplasmic Cl − homeostasis in epithelial morphogenesis and de - velopment underscores the importance of examining possible underlying mechanisms in future studies . Materials and Methods Mice . The Tmem16a null allele , Ano1 tm1Jrr , has been described previously ( 9 ) . Breeding colonies were maintained in a mixed genetic background by out - crossing C57BL / 6J Ano1 tm1Jrr males to FVB females , which were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory . Mice were housed in an animal facility and maintained in a temperature - controlled and light - controlled environment with an alternating 12 - h light / dark cycle . A maximum of five mice were housed per cage . All protocols have been approved by the University of California San Francisco Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Cell Cultures and Generation of TMEM16A Knockout mIMCD3 Cells . Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were derived from E10 . 5 mouse embryos using standard protocols , as previously described ( 43 ) . mIMCD3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . Only cells under 15 passages from the parental ATCC stock were used for analyses . MEFs were grown in DMEM ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % bovine calf serum , penicillin , and streptomycin . To induce cilia formation , confluent MEFs and NIH 3T3 cultures were serum starved for 24 h . mIMCD3 cells were cultured in DMEM / F12 1 : 1 ( Gibco ) , supplemented with 10 % bovinecalf serum , penicillin , and streptomycin . To generate CRISPR - mediated knockout of TMEM16A , a guide DNA oligo dimer ( 5 ′ GCATACTTGCATTCGGCGTCG 3 ′ ) targeted to exon 3 of mouse Tmem16a was inserted into the vector pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ( PX459 ) V2 . 0 ( Addgene 62988 ) as described ( 44 ) . One day after seeding , mIMCD3 cells at ∼ 70 % confluence were transfected with the Tmem16a - PX459 plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Two days posttransfection , cells were incubated with fresh media plus 1 μ g / mL puromycin ( Sigma ) for 3 – 5 d . Nontransfected cells were used as control to de - termine the killing dose and time for puromycin selection . Individual puromycin - resistant clones were isolated with cloning cylinders ( Sigma ) and expanded in normal media . For genotyping , genomic DNA was isolated from clone and control cells using the quick DNA purification protocol from The Jackson Labo - ratory . A 300 - bp fragment including exon 3 was amplified and cloned into pcR4 - TOPO TA vector ( Invitrogen ) , which was transformed into Dh5 α competent Escherichia coli ( New England Biolabs ) . From each transformation , 8 – 10 bacteria colonies were analyzed to determine the sites of mutations via sequencing . A B C PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 microdomain Intensity ( A .

Membrane - tethered mRFP - FKBP - INPP5E and Lyn 11 - FRB - CFP were obtained from Addgene . Benzbromarone ( Tocris Bioscience ) and wortmannin ( Sigma ) were reconstituted with DMSO . For protein immunostaining , cells or tissue sections were fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 20 min at room temperature ; for centrosomal markers , samples were treated with cold methanol for 5 min after PFA fix - ation . Immunostaining of cells and sections was carried out as described ( 43 ) . Briefly , after fixation , samples were washed and blocked with IF buffer ( 1 × PBS with 1 % heat - inactivated goat / donkey serum and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ) . Primary antibodies were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C . After washing with IF buffer , secondary antibodies and DAPI were added at 1 : 1 , 000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature . Samples were washed with 1 × PBS and mounted with Fluoromount - G ( South - ernBiotech ) . Lipid staining was performed as described ( 25 , 26 ) . Briefly , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde and per - meabilized with 0 . 3 % saponin instead of Triton X - 100 . Washing and staining were performed with IF buffer ( 1 × PBS with 5 % serum and 0 . 2 % saponin ) at room temperature . Samples were then imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 or SP8 confocal microscope with the 63 × HC PL Apo oil CS2 objective . Transferrin Uptake Assay . Control and Tmem16a KO mIMCD3 cells , either nontransfected or mEmerald - Rab11A transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 , were seeded on gelatin - coated coverslips . The second day , cells were serum starved for 2 h and used for transferrin uptake as described ( 45 ) . Briefly , cells were incubated with 25 μ g / mL transferrin ( Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) diluted in normal serum - free DMEM / F12 at 4 °C . After being washed three times with ice - cold DMEM / F12 , cells were incubated with phenol red - free media or Tyrode ’ s solution ( 145 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 10 mM Hepes , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glucose , pH 7 . 3 adjusted with NaOH , 290 Osmol / L ) with 5 % serum at 37 °C to allow transferrin uptake . Coverslips were fixed at specific time points with 4 % paraformaldehyde , and processed for confocal imaging using a Leica SP8 . To induce Cl − efflux , cells were incubated with low Cl − Tyrode ’ s solution ( 145 mM Na gluconate , 5 mM KCl , 10 mM Hepes , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glucose , pH 7 . 3 , 299 Osmol / L ) or high I − Tyrode ’ s solution ( 145 mM NaI , 5 mM KCl , 10 mM Hepes , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glucose , pH 7 . 3 , 290 Osmol / L ) . Chloride Sensor Confocal Live Imaging . Control and Tmem16a KO mIMCD3 cells were transfected with EYFP plasmids ( 19 ) using Lipofectamine 3000 and seeded onto gelatin - coated 35 - mm glass bottom dishes . On the day of imag - ing , cells were washed with PBS and switched to normal Tyrode ’ s solution with 5 % serum and equilibrated for 10 min at 37 °C . To induce Cl − efflux , cells were switched to low Cl − Tyrode ’ s solution with 5 % serum . To induce Cl − influx , low Cl − solution was removed and normal Tyrode ’ s solution was added back . Live imaging was performed using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope with the 40 × HC PL Apo oil CS2 objective in a temperature - and CO 2 - controlled chamber . Cells were imaged for 20 min at 30 s per frame . Movies and snapshots were generated using Fiji / ImageJ . Scanning Electron Microscopy . For scanning electron microscope , embryonic and newborn tracheas were dissected in cold PBS and fixed with 2 % para - formaldehyde and 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer . After buffer rinses , samples were postfixed in 1 % OsO 4 at room temperature for 4 h followed by dehydrating in an ethanol series . Critical point drying was done with a Hitachi HCP - 2 critical point dryer . Samples were coated with a Hitachi E - 1010 ion sputter . An FEI Quanta 200 scanning electron micro - scope at 20 kV was used for viewing and imaging . Whole - Cell Recording . Standard Tyrode ’ s solution ( 145 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 10 mM Hepes , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM glucose , pH 7 . 3 adjusted with NaOH , 290 Osmol / L ) was used for whole - cell recording . The pipette solution contained 150 mM N - methyl - D - glucamine ( NMDG ) - Cl , 10 mM Hepes , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 3 – 7 . 4 ( adjusted with HCl ) . For recording , cells were lifted from their culture dishes with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA and plated onto coverslips . After cells settledfor about 20min , coverslips were transferredto a recording chamber on a Nikon - TE2000 inverted scope . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings were per - formed using borosilicate capillary glass electrodes ( Sutter Instrument ) polished to a tip resistance of 2 – 3 M Ω . Data were collected with an Axopatch 700B patch - clamp amplifier and a Digidata 1440 digitizer with pClamp10 software ( Molecular Devices ) . I – V curves were graphed with Origin 6 ( OriginLab ) . Spheroid Formation . mIMCD3 spheroids were cultured as described ( 18 ) . Either 20 μ M benzbromarone or 10 μ M 1PBC was added to DMEM / F12 media for the CaCC blocker treatment . Spheroids were cultured with fresh media plus 10 % serum , with or without blocker , for 4 – 5 d , and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde . Immunostaining and image acquisition were described above . Imaging Analysis . The fluorescence intensity of proteins and lipids were an - alyzed using line - scan based analysis in Fiji / ImageJ . Either raw data or nor - malizedintensitywerepresented . Foranalysisoftransferrinuptake , cellswith either perinuclear or cytoplasmic transferrin localization were counted . For each measurement , cell area was outlined with the freehand selection tool in Fiji / ImageJ and the average intensity per pixel of transferrin was used for quantification . Alternatively , if a cell junction marker was used , such as phalloidin , cell area was defined by the pattern of apical phalloidin . The internalized transferrin at different time points was normalized to the av - erage amount of transferrin internalized at the first time point ( 5 min postinternalization ) ; the fold change in transferrin intensity was used to distinguish between uptake and recycling defects . For analysis of PIP 2 microdomains , a 10 - pixel wide and 200 - pixel long straight line wasdrawn using the line toolofFiji / ImageJnearthecell periphery of randomly selected cells to generate the intensity profile of PIP 2 micro - domains . The intensity of PIP 2 microdomains was plotted by frequency distri - bution analysis using Prism . Quantification of plasma membrane lipids was performed using the same approach as transferrin internalization analysis . For cell neighbor and polygon analysis , cell shapes were determined by phalloidin , ZO - 1 , or E - cadherin staining . The numbers of edges per cell were determined by Neighbor Analysis in the BioVoxxel Toolbox in Fiji / ImageJ or manually , from at least three embryonic samples or 10 spheroids per ge - notype . Data analysis was performed with Excel and Prism7 . Statistical Analysis . Methods for statistical analysis and numbers of samples measured in this study are specified in the figure legends .
