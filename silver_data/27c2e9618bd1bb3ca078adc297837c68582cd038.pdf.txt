Gut 2007 ; 56 : 1557 – 1563 . doi : 10 . 1136 / gut . 2007 . 129858 Background and aims : The activation of the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor c ( PPAR c ) that forms heterodimers with retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) elicits an antineoplastic effect on colorectal cancer . It was previously reported that the accumulation of the non - functional phosphorylated form of RXR a ( p - RXR a ) interfered with its signalling and promoted the growth of hepatoma cells . In this study the effects of p - RXR a on the ability of RXR a and PPAR c ligands to inhibit growth in colon cancer cells was examined . Methods : The effects of the combination of the PPAR c ligand ciglitazone and the RXR a lignad 9 - cis - retinoic acid ( RA ) on inhibition of cell growth in Caco2 human colon cancer cells which express high levels of p - RXR a protein were examined Results : The RXR a protein was phospholylated and also accumulated in human colon cancer tissue samples as well as human colon cancer cell lines . When the phosphorylation of RXR a was inhibited by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 or by transfection with a point - mutated RXR a , which mimicked the unphosphorylated form , the combination of 9 - cis RA and ciglitazone synergistically inhibited the cell growth and induced apoptosis . The combined treatment with these agents also caused a decrease in the expression levels of both cyclo - oxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) and c - Jun proteins and mRNAs . Reporter assays indicated that this combination induced the transcriptional activity of the peroxisome proliferator - responsive element promoter and also inhibited that of the AP - 1 promoter . Conclusion : A malfunction of RXR a due to phosphorylation is associated with colorectal cancer . Therefore , the inhibition of phosphorylation of RXR a and the activation of the RXR – PPAR c heterodimer by their respective ligands may be useful in the chemoprevention and / or treatment of colorectal cancer . P eroxisome proliferator - activated receptor c ( PPAR c ) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis , energy metabolism , inflammatory responses and the induction of apoptosis . 1 2 Recent studies have indicated that the aberrant expression of PPAR c has been observed in several types of human malignancies , including colorectal cancer . 3 – 5 Moreover , both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that PPAR c agonists can inhibit cell growth , cause apoptosis and thus exert antitumour effects in human colon cancer . 5 – 7 These reports suggest that the activation of PPAR c by its ligand may be a potentially useful strategy for the chemoprevention and / or treatment of colorectal cancer . PPARs are ligand - activated transcription factors . As a result , after ligand binding , PPAR c can regulate gene expression by binding to the peroxisome proliferator - responsive element ( PPRE ) in target genes as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptors ( RXRs ) . 8 9 RXR consists of three subtypes , a , b and c . 10 Among them , we previously found a malfunction of RXR a due to post - translational modification by phosphorylation to be associated with carcinogenesis of the liver . 11 12 The phosphory - lated form of RXR a ( p - RXR a ) lost its transactivation activity via the RXR - responsive element and interfered with the function of remaining normal RXR a in a dominant - negative manner , thereby promoting the growth of hepatoma cells . 11 Exogenous 9 - cis - retinoic acid ( RA ) , a natural ligand for RXRs , induced the degradation of RXR a while also restoring the function of this receptor in human hepatoma cells . 11 These findings may explain how the retinoid can inhibit the growth of hepatoma cells in both clinical 13 14 and in vitro studies , 15 16 thereby leading us to hypothesise that the phosphorylation of the RXR a protein may thus play a role in other types of human malignancies , including colorectal cancer . In view of these observations , there has been considerable interest in utilising the combination of ligands for PPAR and RXR for the prevention and treatment of various types of cancer . 17 – 20 In the present study , we examined in detail the effects of such combined treatment on the inhibition of cell growth in Caco2 human colon cancer cells which express high levels of phosphorylated RXR a ( p - RXR a ) protein . We also transfected Caco2 cells with the mutant RXR a which expressed the unphosphorylated form of RXR a , and we examined the effects of the combination of these ligands on the cyclo - oxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) expression in these cells , since COX - 2 expression has been shown to play a crucial role in the development of human colorectal cancer . 21 22 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials 9 - cis RA and PD98059 ( a MEK inhibitor ) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co .

Plasmid construction Histidine - tagged wild - type RXR a was constructed using pRShRXR a ( kindly provided by Dr RM Evans , The Salk Institute , La Jolla , CA , USA ) , by PCR . The point - mutated RXR a T82A / S260A , in which both Thr82 and Ser260 are mutated to alanine , which are putative phosphorylation sites for mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , and thus mimicking the unphosphorylated form of RXR a protein , has been previously described . 11 Cell lines and cell culture The Caco2 , HT29 , colo320 , colo201 , DLD - 1 and SW837 human colorectal cancer cell lines were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank ( Tokyo , Japan ) . The HCT - 116 human colorectal cancer cell line and the FHC normal human fetal colon cell line were obtained from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) . All of the cell lines were maintained in RF10 medium containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FCS . The cells were cultured in an incubator with humidified air at 37 ˚ C with 5 % CO 2 . Cell proliferation assays Four thousand Caco2 cells were seeded into multiple 35 mm diameter dishes in RF10 medium , and 24 h later they were treated with 5 m M 9 - cis RA alone , 10 m M cig alone or a combination of these agents in the presence or absence of 50 m M PD98059 for 24 h . The doses of these reagents were selected according to our previous 11 study and Yang et al . 20 The numbers of viable cells in replica plates were then counted using the trypan blue dye exclusion method , as previously described . 23 Apoptosis assays Caco2 cells were treated with 5 m M 9 - cis RA alone , 10 m M cig alone or a combination of these agents in the presence or absence of 50 m M PD98059 for 24 h . To quantify the induction of apoptosis , a DNA fragmentation assay was performed using the Cell Death Detection ELISA PLUS kit , ( Roche Diagnostics , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions , as described previously . 16 The TUNEL ( terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase - mediated dUTP nick - end label - ling ) method was also performed using the In situ Cell Death Detection Kit ( Roche Diagnostics ) , which visualises apoptotic cell death by detecting DNA strand breaks in the individual cells , as described previously . 23 Protein extraction and western blot analysis Total cellular protein was extracted and equivalent amounts of protein were examined by a western blot analysis , as previously described . 11 Polyclonal anti - RXR a ( D N197 ) and anti - COX2 ( C - 20 ) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc .

Monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) was from Chemicon International ( Temecula , CA , USA ) . An antibody against GAPDH was used as a loading control . The intensities of the blots were quantified using the NIH Image software version 1 . 61 . RNA extraction and semi - quantitative reverse transcription - PCR analysis Both RNA extraction and a reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) analysis were performed as described previously . 24 Total RNA was isolated from Caco2 cells using ISOGEN ( WAKO Pure Chemical , Osaka , Japan ) . cDNA was amplified from 1 m g of total RNA using a High Fidelity RNA PCR Kit ( TAKARA Biomedicals , Tokyo , Japan ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . c - Jun - , COX - 2 - and GAPDH - specific primer sets and the amplification cycle conditions were as previously described . 24 – 26 Using a thermal controller ( Programmable Thermal Controller ; MJ Research Inc . , Watertown , MA , USA ) , 25 - and 30 - cycle rounds of PCR were chosen for an optimum analysis of the expression of c - Jun and COX - 2 mRNAs , respectively . The intensities of the mRNA bands were then quantified using the NIH Image software package version 1 . 61 . Luciferase reporter assays Reporter assays were performed as described previously . 11 The PPRE - luciferase reporter plasmid PPRE 3 - TK - LUC was kindly provided by the late Dr K Umesono ( Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan ) . 27 The AP - 1 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid pAP - 1 - Luc was purchased from Stratagene ( La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Caco2 cells were co - transfected with a combination of wild - type or a mutant hRXR a - expressing plasmid ( 300 ng / 35 mm dish ) with PPRE 3 - TK - LUC or pAP - 1 - Luc reporter ( 750 ng / 35 mm dish ) , along with p RL - CMV ( Renilla luciferase , 100 ng / 35 mm dish ; Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) as an internal standard to normalise the transfection efficiency . Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . After exposure of the cells for 24 h to the transfection mixture , the cells were treated with vehicle , 5 m M 9 - cis RA , 10 m M cig or the combina - tion of these agents for 24 h . Thereafter , the cell lysates were prepared and the luciferase activity of each cell lysate was determined using a dual - luciferase reporter assay system ( Promega ) . Changes in the firefly luciferase activity were calculated and plotted after normalisation with changes in Renilla luciferase activity in the same sample . Tissue specimens Colon cancer and its surrounding non - cancerous colon tissues were obtained by surgical resections from eight patients . This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Gifu University School of Medicine , and all of the patients gave their written informed consent . Statistical analysis The data are expressed as the mean ( SD ) . Statistical signifi - cance of the difference in the mean values was assessed with one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , followed by Sheffe’s t test . RESULTS The RXR a protein is phosphorylated in colon cancer cells In our initial study we examined whether or not the RXR a protein is constitutively phosphorylated in a series of human colorectal cancer cell lines and the FHC normal human fetal colon cell line ( fig 1 ) . The anti - RXR a ( D N197 ) antibody , which can be regarded as the specific antibody for the phosphorylated form of RXR a protein , was utilized for the western blot analysis . 11 28 We found that the level of the p - RXR a protein was constitutively increased in all seven colorectal cancer cell lines ( Caco2 , HT29 , Colo201 , Colo320 , DLD - 1 HCT - 116 and SW837 ) that we examined in this study . On the other hand , the p - RXR a protein was not detected in the FHC cell line ( fig 1 , lanes 1 ) . We also found a marked decrease in the level of this protein when the cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 alone ( fig 1 , lanes 3 ) or the combination of 9 - cis RA plus PD98059 ( fig 1 , lanes 4 ) in all of these colon cancer cells . 1558 Yamazaki , Shimizu , Okuno , et al www . gutjnl . com group . bmj . com on June 2 , 2015 - Published by http : / / gut . bmj . com / Downloaded from 9 - cis RA plus cig cause a synergistic decrease in the p - RXR a protein in Caco2 cells in the presence of MEK inhibitor We next examined whether 9 - cis RA and the PPAR c agonist cig inhibit the phosphorylation of RXR a in Caco2 cells , which express both the RXR a and PPAR c mRNAs . 29 There was no remarkable change in the expression level of p - RXR a when the cells were treated with 9 - cis RA alone , cig alone or the combination of these ligands in the absence of PD98059 ( fig 2 , lanes 1 – 4 ) . However , when the cells were treated with these ligands in the presence of PD98059 , there was a decrease in the expression level of p - RXR a proteins ( fig 2 , lanes 6 and 7 ) . This decrease was more apparent when the cells were treated with a combination of all three agents ( fig 2 , lane 8 ) . 9 - cis RA plus cig synergistically inhibit expression of COX - 2 and c - Jun in Caco2 cells COX - 2 may thus play a critical role in the development of colorectal cancer . 21 We therefore next examined whether the combined treatment with 9 - cis RA plus cig inhibits the expres - sion of COX - 2 and c - Jun , a component of AP - 1 which plays a role in the expression of COX - 2 at the level of transcription , 30 31 in Caco2 colon cancer cells ( fig 3 ) . In the presence of PD98059 , 9 - cis RA or cig caused a small decrease in the levels of COX - 2 ( fig 3A , lanes 6 or 7 , lower panel ) and c - Jun ( fig 3B , lanes 6 or 7 , lower panel ) proteins . The combination of these three agents further inhibited the expression of these proteins ( fig 3A and B , lanes 8 , lower panel ) . The decreases in COX - 2 and c - Jun proteins were paralleled by similar decreases in their mRNAs ( fig 3A and B , upper panels ) . Moreover , as shown in fig 3C and D , similar effects for the expression levels of both COX - 2 and c - Jun proteins and mRNAs were also observed in mutant RAR a Figure 1 Levels of the phosphorylated form of the retinoid X receptor a ( RXR a ) protein in colon cancer cell lines and the FHC normal human colon epithelial cell line . Seven human colon cancer cell lines Caco2 , HT29 , Colo201 , Colo320 , DLD - 1 , HCT - 116 and SW837 cells and FHC normal human colon epithelial cells were treated with vehicle ( lane 1 ) , 5 m M 9 - cis - retinoic acid ( RA ) ( lane 2 ) , 50 m M PD98059 ( lane 3 ) or the combination of 50 m M PD98059 and 5 m M 9 - cis RA ( lane 4 ) for 24 h . Total protein extracts were prepared from the indicated cell lines , and equivalent amounts of protein ( 15 m g / lane ) were then examined by a western blot analysis for the phosphorylated RXR a protein . An antibody against glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase served as a loading control . The intensities of blots were quantitated by densitometry , and the values are shown as bar graphs in the lower panel . Repeat western blot analyses gave similar results .

We previously reported that MAPKs are involved in RXR a phosphorylation in human HCC cells . 11 15 Therefore , these findings suggest that the phophoryla - tion of the RXR a protein by MAPKs may thus interfere with the function of the ligands for RXR a and PPAR c and that the induction of the unphosphorylated ( ie , functional ) form of RXR a intensifies the responses to ligands of RXR a and PPAR c , thereby affecting the expression of target molecules , including COX - 2 and c - Jun . 9 - cis RA plus cig synergistically activate the PPRE promoter activity , inhibit the AP - 1 promoter activity , inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in Caco2 cells PPAR c regulates gene expression by binding to the PPRE element in target genes as a heterodimer with RXRs and thus controlling growth of cells . 8 We then examined the effects of the combination of 9 - cis RA plus cig on the transcriptional activity of the PPRE and AP - 1 promoters , using transient transfection luciferase reporter assays . As shown in fig 4A , left panel , we found that in mutant RAR a T82A / S260A - transfected Caco2 cells , the treatment with this combination caused a synergistic increase in the transcriptional activity of the PPRE luciferase reporter activity . Treatment with either 9 - cis RA alone or cig alone also caused significant inhibition of the AP - 1 luciferase reporter activity , and this inhibition was thus enhanced when the cells were treated with a combination of these agents ( fig 4A , right panel ) . Moreover , in the presence of PD98059 , treatment with 9 - cis RA or cig significantly inhibited the growth of Caco2 cells , and the combined treatment with all three agents caused even stronger growth inhibition ( fig . 4B , lanes 6 – 8 , left panel ) . Similar growth inhibitory effects by treatment with these ligands were also observed in mutant RAR a T82A / S260A - transfected Caco2 cells ( fig 4B , lanes 6 – 8 , right panel ) . In addition , as shown in fig 4C , the DNA fragmentation assays ( left panel ) and TUNEL ( terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase - mediated dUTP nick - end label - ling ) methods ( right panel ) indicated that , in the presence of PD98059 , the combination of 9 - cis RA plus cig caused a significant induction of apoptosis in Caco2 cells ( lane 8 of left Figure 3 Effects of the combination of 9 - cis - retinoic acid ( RA ) plus ciglitazone ( cig ) on cellular levels of cyclo - oxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) mRNA and protein , and on c - Jun mRNA and protein in Caco2 cells .

( C and D ) After Caco2 cells were transfected with wild - type ( WT ; lanes 1 – 4 ) or mutant RXR a ( lanes 5 – 8 ) , the cells were treated with vehicle ( lanes 1 and 5 ) , 5 m M 9 - cis RA ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , 10 m M cig ( lanes 3 and 7 ) and the combination of 5 m M 9 - cis RA plus 10 m M cig ( lanes 4 and 8 ) for 24 h . The cell extracts were then examined by a RT - PCR analysis using COX - 2 - ( C , upper panel ) or c - Jun - ( D , upper panel ) specific primers , or then were examined by a western blot analysis using COX - 2 - ( C , lower panel ) or c - Jun - ( D , lower panel ) specific antibodies . Amplified PCR products obtained with glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) - specific primers served as internal controls ( A – D , upper panels ) .

These findings indicate that under conditions in which the phosphorylation of RXR a is reduced , the suppression of cell growth by combined treatment with 9 - cis RA plus cig is associated with apoptosis . The phosphorylated form of the RXR a protein is accumulated in human colorectal cancer tissues We next examined whether the p - RXR a protein is present in human colorectal cancer tissues . Figure 5 shows the results of a western blot analysis of the nuclear extracts prepared from eight pairs of human colorectal cancer tissue and adjacent normal colon epithelial tissue . We thus found that the RXR a protein was highly phosphorylated in six of the eight samples of colorectal cancer tissues when compared with their correspond - ing normal colon epithelial tissue ( fig 5 ) , although there were no significant differences in the expression levels of the unphosphorylated form of RXR a proteins between cancer tissues and adjacent normal colon epithelial tissues ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION The present studies provide us with the first evidence that the RXR a protein is phospholylated in both a series of human colon cancer cell lines and primary human colon cancer tissue samples , although the levels of expression of p - RXR a did not increase in FHC normal colonic epithelial cells ( figs 1 and 5 ) . These findings are consistent with our previous findings in human hepatoma cell lines and in hepatoma tissue samples , 11 and suggest that , as in hepatoma , a malfunction of RXR a due to phosphorylation might be associated with the development of colorectal cancer . In addition , we also found that the combina - tion of 9 - cis RA and cig caused a synergistic inhibition in the growth of human colon cancer Caco2 cells ( fig 4B ) and this was associated with the induction of apoptosis ( fig 4C ) and inhibition of the expression of both COX - 2 and c - Jun proteins and mRNAs ( fig 3 ) . The combination of these agents had a synergistic effect in increasing the PPRE activity and decreasing the AP - 1 activity ( fig 4A ) . These preferable effects were observed when the phosphorylation of RXR a protein was either Figure 4 Effects of the combination of 9 - cis - retinoic acid ( RA ) plus ciglitazone ( cig ) on the transcriptional activity of the peroxisome proliferator - responsive element ( PPRE ) and AP - 1 promoters ( A ) , inhibition of cell growth ( B ) and induction of apoptosis ( C ) in Caco2 cells . ( A ) After Caco2 cells were transfected with wild - type ( WT ; lanes 1 – 4 ) or mutant retinoid X receptor a ( RXR a ) ( lanes 5 – 8 ) , transient transfection reporter assays were performed with the indicated luciferase reporter in the presence of vehicle ( lanes 1 and 5 ) , 5 m M 9 - cis RA ( lanes 2 and 6 ) , 10 m M cig ( lanes 3 and 7 ) or the combination of 5 m M 9 - cis RA plus 10 m M cig ( lanes 4 and 8 ) .

The cell proliferation assay was then performed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method . Similar results were obtained in a repeat experiment .

Therefore , the inhibition of the phosphorylation of this protein appears to play a critical role in inducing the growth inhibitory effect presented in this study . A general question posed by the present study is the molecular mechanisms by which the combination of 9 - cis RA and cig synergistically induce these diverse cellular and biochemical effects in colon cancer cells . A hypothetical scheme that addresses this question is shown in fig 6 . In normal colonic epithelial cells , activated PPAR c forms a heterodimer with RXR a and binds to the PPRE in promoter regions of target genes . 8 However , in colon cancer cells , the Ras / MAPK signalling pathway is highly activated and phosphorylates RXR a , thus impairing the functions of this receptor . The MEK inhibitor PD98059 or the point - mutated RXR a T82A / S260A prevent the phosphorylation of RXR a , thus causing an increase in the unphosphorylated form of RXR a protein and restoring the heterodimeric activity with PPAR c in the presence of their lignads , 9 - cis RA and cig . A synergistic effect on target gene expression was originally reported with the optimal interaction of RXR a – PPAR c heterodimers . 8 Tsao et al 32 also reported that in HEK293 cells the transcriptional activity of PPRE was additively induced by treatment with a PPAR c activator plus 9 - cis RA , and RXR a accumulation through inhibiting its degradation by the proteasome system contributes to the enhancement of PPAR c / RXR activation . It is of interest that the PPAR and RXR ligands have been shown to recruit subsets of transcriptional coactiva - tors to the receptor complex differentially , thus leading to an enhanced transcriptional activation and cellular effects . 33 The findings of these reports support our finding that the accumulation of the unphosphorylated form ( ie , functional form ) of RXR a enhances the transcriptional activity of PPRE ( fig 4A , left panel ) and it may also explain the growth inhibitory effects of the combined treatment with RXR and PPAR ligands , which are observed in various types of cancer cells . 17 – 20 There is considerable evidence that COX - 2 may play a critical role in the development of colorectal cancer and might , therefore , be an important molecular target for colorectal cancer prevention and treatment . 21 22 In this study , we found that the combined use of ligands for RXR a and PPAR c inhibited COX - 2 expression in Caco2 cells ( fig 3A and C ) . This finding may be of significance because the inhibition of COX - 2 expression is one of the mechanisms by which the PPAR c pathway induces apoptosis . 20 Presumably , the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of the AP - 1 promoter by the combined action of these agents ( fig 4A , right panel ) contributes to the inhibition of COX - 2 expression because AP - 1 plays an Figure 5 The expression levels of the phosphorylated form of the retinoid X receptor a ( RXR a ) protein in human colon cancer tissues . Eight pairs of human colon cancer ( C ) and its adjacent normal tissue ( N ) were obtained from surgical resections . Total protein was extracted and equivalent amounts of protein ( 15 m g / lane ) were examined by western blot analysis for the phosphorylated RXR a protein ( p - RXR ) . An antibody against glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) served as a loading control . Figure 6 A hypothetical schematic representation of the effects of the combinatio n of 9 - cis - retinoic acid ( RA ) plus ciglitazone ( cig ) on growth and gene expression in colon cancer cells . When peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor c ( PPAR c ) is activated by ligand binding , it is able to heterodimerise with retinoid X receptor ( RXR ) and activate target gene expression by binding to the peroxisome proliferator - responsive element ( PPRE ) in various gene s in normal colonic epithelial cells ( A ) . In colon cancer cells , the Ras / mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway phosphorylates RXR a , which impairs its function as a heterodimeric partner for PPAR c ( B ) . In the presence of MEK inhibitor PD98059 , RXR a can escape phosphorylation by Erk ( C ) . A point - mutated RXR a T82A / S260A , which mimics the unphosphorylated form of RXR a , can form a heterodimer with PPAR c and thereby activate target gene expression by binding to the PPRE ( D ) . Combined treatment with 9 - cis RA plus cig can activate the transcriptional activity of PPRE and synergistically inhibit the expression of c - Jun , thus inhibiting the transcriptional activity of AP - 1 and the expression of cyclo - oxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) in colon cancer cells ( E ) . These combined effects may contribute to growth inhibition in colon cancer cells . 1562 Yamazaki , Shimizu , Okuno , et al www . gutjnl . com group . bmj . com on June 2 , 2015 - Published by http : / / gut . bmj . com / Downloaded from important role in activating the expression of this molecule . 30 31 However , it is likely that some other unknown mechanisms also play a role . For example , in the 2 , 4 , 6 - trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid ( TNBS ) - induced rat colitis model , administra - tion of a PPAR c agonist reduced the expression of COX - 2 and nuclear transcription factor NF - k B p65 proteins . 34 Both NF - k B and AP - 1 play an important role in regulating COX - 2 expression via the NF - k B - binding site in the COX - 2 promoter . 35 Moreover , TNBS - induced colitis was significantly reduced by the administration of both PPAR c and RXR agonists , and this beneficial effect was also reflected by the reduction in the NF - k B DNA binding activity in the colon . 36 PPAR c agonist has been shown to inhibit chemically induced colitis and an early phase of colitis - related colon carcinogenesis in the rodent model . 37 It also seems to be of interest that the inhibition of the b - catenin pathway , which promotes the development of colon cancer , by non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , requires a high level of expression of RXR a and PPAR c . 38 As a result , the activation of the RXR – PPAR c heterodimer by the co - administration of their ligands is thus considered to protect against colonic inflamma - tion and tumorigenesis . In conclusion , these previous reports , together with the results of our in vitro mechanistic studies on colon cancer cells as described herein , suggest that combination therapy with both RXR and PPAR c ligands might therefore be clinically useful in the prevention and / or treatment of both colon cancer and colonic inflammation , due to their synergistic effects . 39 Authors’ affiliations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
