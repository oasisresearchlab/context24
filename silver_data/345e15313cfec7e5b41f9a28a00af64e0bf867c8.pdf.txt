Epigenetic modifications contribute to the establishment and maintenance of cancer subclasses , as well as to the EMT process . Whether histone variants contribute to these transformations is not known . We investigated the relative expression levels of histone macroH2A1 splice variants and correlated it with breast cancer status / prognosis / types . Methods : To detect differential expression of macroH2A1 variant mRNAs in breast cancer cells and tumor samples , we used the following databases : GEO , EMBL - EBI and publisher databases ( may - august 2012 ) . We extracted macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratios and performed correlation studies on intrinsic molecular subclasses of breast cancer and on molecular characteristics of EMT . Associations between molecular and survival data were determined . Results : We found increased macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratios to be associated with the claudin - low intrinsic subtype in breast cancer cell lines . At the molecular level this association translates into a positive correlation between macroH2A1 ratios and molecular characteristics of the EMT process . Moreover , untreated Triple Negative Breast Cancers presenting a high macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratio exhibit a poor outcome . Conclusion : These results provide first evidence that macroH2A1 . 1 could be exploited as an actor in the maintenance of a transient cellular state in EMT progress towards metastatic development of breast tumors .

Treatment of TNBC has been challenging due to its heterogeneity at the molecular level and the absence of well - defined molecular targets [ 1 , 2 ] . Despite a frequent complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy , TNBC patients also have a higher rate of long term recurrence and worse prognosis than ER - positive BC patients . Distinguishing chemore - sistant TNBC patients at risk to relapse from those with a relatively favorable prognosis , would help to identify clinically relevant subgroups that could benefit from alternative treatments . Advances in gene expression profiling have permitted charac - terization of different intrinsic molecular subtypes present in TNBC [ 3 ] . One of these , the claudin - low breast cancer subtype [ 4 ] , is characterized by mesenchymal features , low expression of cell - cell junction proteins ( i . e . , E - cadherin ) , and intense immune infiltrates . Furthermore , claudin - low tumors have unique biolog - ical properties linked to mammary stem cells [ 5 ] and Epithelial - Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) features [ 6 ] . Gene expression during EMT is dependent on specific transcription factors that interact with enhancer or promoter elements , the accessibility of their binding sites which is regulated by epigenetic reprogramming [ 7 , 8 ] . Hence , chromatin reorgani - zation could contribute to the regulation of epithelial plasticity [ 9 – 12 ] . To date however , the presence of histone variants has not been investigated with respect to the phenomenon of EMT . Gene expression accompanying EMT is also regulated at the post - transcriptional level via alternative splicing of RNA [ 13 – 15 ] . The histone variant macroH2A1 is a vertebrate - specific member of the H2A family and is unusual due to the presence of a C - terminal macro domain [ 16 ] . Two isoforms , macroH2A1 . 1 and macroH2A1 . 2 are produced by alternative splicing of the H2AFY gene . Both isoforms have been associated with silencing and transcriptional repression [ 17 – 19 ] . Regulation of macroH2A1 expression seems to be linked to self - renewal and commitment of ES cells , representing a barrier to reprogramming pluripotency PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98930 [ 20 – 22 ] . In melanoma , loss of macroH2A1 promoted progression of metastasis [ 23 ] . Moreover , high levels of macroH2A1 . 1 are associated with slowly proliferating cancers , whereas highly proliferating tumors have markedly decreased macroH2A1 . 1 levels . Conversely , macroH2A1 . 2 expression is independent of proliferation in all tumours [ 24 – 26 ] . Notably , expression of macroH2A1 . 1 has been identified as a novel biomarker in lung and colon cancer models [ 25 , 26 ] . In this study , we demonstrate that selective splicing of the H2AFY gene is correlated with EMT features linked to Claudin - low breast cancers . We propose that macroH2A1 . 1 expression levels could participate in the epigenetic program linked to poor clinical outcome of this molecular breast cancer subtype , and more generally in the EMT process . Materials and Methods Cell culture MCF - 7 and MDA - MB231 were obtained from ATCC . ZR - 75 , MDA - MB436 and Hs578T , were a gift from G . Freiss ( Montpellier , France ) , originally purchased from ATCC [ 27 ] . MDA - MB231 , MDA - MB436 and Hs578T cells were maintained in DMEM high glucose with glutamax . MCF - 7 cells were maintained in DMEM / F12 with Glutamax . ZR - 75 cells were maintained in RPMI - 1640 supplemented with 10 mM Hepes . All these media were supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 mM sodium pyruvate . Protein quantification Antibodies against macroH2A1 ( 07 - 219 ; Upstate ) , macroH2A1 . 1 and macroH2A1 . 2 ( gift by A . Ladurner ) , ER a ( sc - 543 ; Santa Cruz ) , GAPDH ( MAB374 ; Millipore ) , H3 ( ab1791 ; Abcam ) were used for immunoblotting . To discriminate between the two splicing isoforms of macroH2A1 , macroH2A1 . 1 and macroH2A1 . 2 , total cell extracts were separated on low cross - linking ( 12 % acrylamide , 1 : 125 bisacrylamide ) SDS - polyacryl - amide gels and blotted with antibodies specific to one of the two isoforms ( Fig . S1 ) specifically . Proteins were quantified using the Image Gauge software . Expression levels of each isoform and total macroH2A1 were normalized to GAPDH . ZR - 75 expression was used as sample reference . RNA extraction , reverse transcription and Quantitative PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen ) . First strand cDNA was generated using the ThermoScript RT - PCR system ( Invitrogen ) and used as the template for quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) using the platinium SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Gene - or splice variant - specific primers are shown in Fig . S2A . Relative levels of RNA were determined using the threshold cycle ( D C T ) method [ 28 ] . Expression levels were normalized to the ribosomal RPLP0 gene . ZR - 75 expression was used as sample calibrator . Determination of the macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio A summary of probe set IDs used is reported in Fig . S2 . Among the probe set ID from HG - U133A , three detect the expression of H2AFY gene : 214501 _ s _ at and 207168 _ s _ at probe set ID which are common to the two isoforms and 214500 _ at which recognized specifically the sequence of the exon 6a of macroH2A1 . 1 and 10 nucleotides in exons 5 and 7 common to macroH2A1 . 1 and macroH2A1 . 2 isoforms ( Fig . S2 ) . We extracted the corresponding log2 RMA values from the different GEO datasets studied and determined relative expression of macroH2A1 ( mean value of 214501 _ s _ at and 207168 _ s _ at ) , macroH2A1 . 1 ( 214500 _ at ) and calculated the macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio by the following formula : log2 ( 214500 at ) { log2 ( 214501 s at ) z log 2 ( 207168 s at ) ½ (cid:2) = 2 ~ log 2 ( macroH 2 A 1 : 1 = macroH 2 A 1 ratio ) Among the probe set ID from Illumina Human - 6 v1 expression bead chip , two of them detect the expression of H2AFY gene : 6620403 probe set ID which is common to the two isoforms and 6620403 which recognized specifically the sequence of the exon 6a of macroH2A1 . 1 . Among the probe set ID from Illumina HumanHT - 12 v4 . 0 expression bead chip , three detect the expression of H2AFY gene : ILMN _ 2373495 and ILMN _ 1746171 probe set ID which are common to the two isoforms and ILMN _ 1674034 which recognized specifically the sequence of the exon 6a of macroH2A1 . 1 . We applied the same formula as above with corresponding log2 RMA values . Analysis of correlation of macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio and breast cancer cell lines markers For each GEO dataset analyzed , we conserved the intrinsic molecular subtype of breast cancer cell lines attributed in the original study or in absence of we attributed the molecular intrinsic subtype as defined in Table S1 . Then we classified the different breast cancer cell lines into two groups , luminal / basal , or claudin - low / non claudin - low and compared the distribution of macroH2A1 , macroH2A1 . 1 expression levels or macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio values ( Table S2 ) . The reported p - values are the results of a two - tailed Mann - Whitney test . Survival analyses A summary of affymetrix microarray datasets used in this study , including the number of patients included in each stage of the analysis , is given in Table 1 . Follow - up data was available for 383 of the 579 TNBC samples from the GSE31519 dataset . All survival intervals were measured from the time of surgery to the distinct survival endpoint used in the individual datasets . In the conduct of the presented analysis event free survival ( EFS ) was calculated as preferentially corre - sponding to the RFS endpoint , but measured with respect to the DMFS endpoint if RFS was not available . Rody A . et al . , [ 29 ] have previously shown that the effect of using these different endpoints was rather small in the overall dataset . Follow up data for those women in whom the envisaged end point was not reached were censored as of the last follow - up date or at 120 months . Subjects with missing values were excluded from the analyses . For the analyses of untreated and adjuvant therapy treatment groups , we applied the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test to compare the cumulative distribution of the two data sets . To determine the cutoff value of macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio , a receiver - operating characteristics ( ROC ) analysis was performed . We constructed Kaplan - Meier curves and used the log - rank test to determine the univariate significance of the variables . The predictive potential of macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio is assessed by its positive and negative predictive values ( PPV and NPV ) ( Table S3 ) . A Cox proportional - hazards model was used to examine the effects of multiple covariates on macroH2A1 . 1 , an Epigenetic Mark of Poor Prognosis PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 2 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98930 T a b l e 1 .

Results Expression of MacroH2A1 splice variants in breast cancer cell lines We quantified protein expression levels of macroH2A1 , macroH2A1 . 1 , macroH2A1 . 2 per se and each of the macroH2A1 isoforms relative to the total macroH2A1 protein pool in BC cell lines . MacroH2A1 isoforms or macroH2A1 expression levels did not differ significantly between cell lines representative of the ER positive luminal subtype , ZR - 75 and MCF - 7 cells , and cell lines of the ER negative basal subtype , MDA - MB436 , Hs578T , and MDA - MB231 ( Fig . 1A ) . In contrast , expression levels of macroH2A1 . 1 protein relative to total macroH2A1 protein pool were greater in cells of the basal subtype compared to the luminal one ( Fig . 1B ) . Unlike macroH2A1 . 2 , which showed no significant variation in expression levels , the increase in macroH2A1 . 1 was greatest in MDA - MB231 cells . Using splice variant - specific primers ( Fig . S2 ) , we also deter - mined that macroH2A1 . 1 transcription was greater in the basal compared to the luminal subgroup of BC cell lines , while mRNA expression levels of macroH2A1 . 2 or total macroH2A1 mRNA did not differ significantly ( Fig . 1C ) . As at the protein level , this differential expression was consolidated by analysis of the proportional expression of macroH2A1 . 1 relative to total macroH2A1 ( Fig . 1D ) . To test whether this observation could be extended to a larger panel of BC cell lines , we analyzed macroH2A1 expression in 51 BC cell lines from data published by Neve et al . , [ 30 ] ( Fig . 1E ) . Total macroH2A1 expression levels were reduced in the basal BC cell lines ( p = 0 . 006 ) . Therefore , even if macroH2A1 . 1 expression levels per se did not vary ( p = 0 . 555 ) , the relative proportion of macroH2A1 . 1 to global macroH2A1 was significantly higher in the basal subtype ( p = 0 . 027 ) . Because the three basal BC cell lines tested ( Fig . 1A – D ) belonged to the claudin - low subtype , we subdivided the cell lines from Neve et al . , study into two groups : claudin - low and non claudin - low BC cell lines . Cell line subtypes were attributed as in Prat et al . , [ 31 ] ( Table S1 ) . Then we compared the relative expression levels of macroH2A1 mRNAs . Increased macroH2A1 . 1 expression levels appeared typical of claudin - low subtype BC cell lines ( Fig . 2A ) . This correlation was significant for the macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio ( compare p - values Fig . 2A center and right panels ) and was further confirmed by our analysis of several independent studies that differed in the nature of the cell lines ( Fig . S3 ) and the array platform used ( Fig . 2B ) . Finally , the study of Lapuk et al . [ 32 ] allowed us to assess alternative splicing in 31 BC cell lines . We first analyzed relative expression levels of each exon of H2AFY gene except that of exon 8 ( data unavailable ) . Globally each exon was less expressed in the claudin - low than in the non - claudin low BC cell lines ( Fig . 3A ) . One exception appeared to be the exon 6a of macroH2A1 . 1 which was expressed more strongly in Claudin - low BC cell lines , but the difference was not statistically significant ( Fig . 3B ) . We normalized the level of expression of each exon ( log2 RMA values ) relative to that of exon 9 , the most expressed exon of the H2AFY gene . As shown in Fig . 3C , expression levels of most of the exons of the H2AFY gene in claudin - low subtype cells decreased ; and this was also true for the macroH2A1 . 2 specific exon 6b ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 3D ) . In contrast , expression levels of macroH2A1 . 1 specific exon 6a increased in the claudin - low compared to the non claudin - low subtype ( p = 0 . 007 ) . Moreover , determination of the splicing index showed that only exon 6a varied in all cell lines tested ( Fig . 3E ) . We conclude that the expression of macroH2A1 . 1 relative to total macroH2A1 expression ( macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio defined in materials and methods ) , not macroH2A1 . 1 expression per se , is correlated specifically with the claudin - low molecular subtype . MacroH2A1 . 1 variant expression correlates with epithelial - mesenchymal transition We classified the macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratios of a set of 38 BC cell lines relative to the E - cadherin expression data determined by Hollestelle et al . , [ 33 ] . In E - cadherin negative cell lines this ratio was generally greater and more diverse , but the difference between E - cadherin positive and E - cadherin negative cells was not statistically significant ( Fig . 4A ) . Different mechanisms for inactivating E - cadherin have been identified in human cancers : inherited and somatic mutations , increased promoter methylation , and induction of transcriptional repressors of the Twist , Snail and Zeb family members [ 6 ] . The latter induce EMT in parallel with induction of mesenchymal markers such as N - cadherin and / or vimentin . Interestingly , most of the cell lines exhibiting high macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratios , expressed N - cadherin and vimentin ( Fig . 4B ) . In order to determine whether enrichment of macroH2A1 . 1 could be related to the EMT process , we analyzed expression levels of this variant in different cellular models of EMT . Comparison of macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratios in HMLE _ shGFP and HMLE _ shEcad , revealed that reduction of E - cadherin expression levels was accompanied by an increase in the macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratio in two independent data sets ( Fig . 4C ) [ 34 , 35 ] . This increase was clearly associated with induction of EMT due to dysfunction in intracellular signaling caused by reduced E - cadherin levels . Indeed , expression of a truncated form of E - cadherin ( D N - Ecad ) lacking the extracellular domain of the wild - type protein normally responsible for E - cadherin cell - cell adhesion was not correlated with an increase in macroH2A1 . 1mRNA ratios ( Fig . 4C ) . Accordingly , overexpression of inducers of EMT , Twist1 , Goosecoid or Snail in the HMLE cell line was accompanied by an increase in macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ( Fig . 4D ) . In contrast , macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratios were not up - regulated by overexpression of TGF - b . This is in agreement with previous observations showing that induction of an EMT by Snail or Twist does not depend on TGF - b autocrine signaling [ 6 ] . Moreover , TGF - b signaling is not sufficient for an EMT conversion in primary normal , immortalized , and neoplastic HMECs [ 36 ] , and is thus insufficient to induce an increase in macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio . Extensive changes in alternative splicing play a role in shaping cellular behavior patterns that characterize EMT . Interestingly , the macroH2A1 . 2 specific exon was shown to be an Epithelial Splicing Regulatory Protein ( ESRP ) - regulated cassette [ 4 ] . Anal - ysis of the genomic context of the exon specifically included in macroH2A1 . 1 identified potential binding sites for the EMT - associated splicing factors , ESRP1 and RBFOX2 ( Fig . 4E ) . ESRP binding sites located at the 5 9 end and within the regulated exon macroH2A1 . 1 , an Epigenetic Mark of Poor Prognosis PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98930 seem to be ESRP Binding Splicing Inhibitors ( EBSI ) , and a RBFOX2 binding site found downstream of the alternatively spliced exon seems to be an RBFOX2 Binding Splicing Enhancer ( RBSE ) . Exon 6a skipping could thus result from the interaction of ESRP1 with EBSI in an epithelial context . In a mesenchymal context , exon 6a would be preferentially included by enhanced binding of RBFOX2 ( Fig . 4E ) . Figure 1 .

We plotted Kaplan - Meier survival curves based on macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratios segmented into two groups , high and low macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratios . The Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) analysis was used to find the optimal cut - off level . We used the log - rank test to determine the univariate significance of the variables . Poor prognosis TNBCs had high macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratios ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 5A ) . The positive predictive value ( PPV ) and negative predictive value ( NPV ) were 49 % and 69 % , respectively . In multivariate Cox regression analysis , including age , histological grade , tumor size and lymph node status , the macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio showed a trend as an independent predictor ( HR 3 . 457 , 95 % CI 1 . 087 to 10 . 990 , p = 0 . 036 ) ( Fig . 5B ) . Among the clinico - pathological characteristics of TNBC patients included in the GSE31519 dataset , the use of systemic treatment was specified . Hence , we sub - divided the cohort into one untreated sub - cohort , and a second treated sub - cohort which regroups all adjuvant treated patients . Analysis of the macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA values in the untreated sub - cohort revealed a distribution comparable to the values of the total cohort ( p = 0 . 235 ) ( Fig . S4 ) . MacroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA values of the group treated with an adjuvant therapy differed from those of the total cohort , with values shifted to higher values of the intervals ( p = 0 . 008 ) ( Fig . S4 ) . Kaplan - Meier survival curves were plotted according to macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratios after segmen - tation into high and low groups as above for the two sub - cohorts . We observed that in contrast to treated tumors , high macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratios still correlated with reduced survival curves for untreated tumor ( p = 0 . 152 vs . p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 6 ) . Discussion We provide evidence that overexpression of macroH2A1 . 1 correlates with major mesenchymal markers of the claudin - low breast cancer subtype . Notably , the increase in macroH2A1 . 1 seems to be a residual track of an EMT process , correlated with poor prognosis in TNBCs . Claudin - low tumors are typically TNBCs with poor long - term prognosis , despite reduced expression of genes related to cell proliferation . Nevertheless , unlike prognostic signatures that rely heavily on proliferation - related genes , macroH2A1 . 1 preferentially associated with non - proliferative phenomena . It would belong to a new prognostic marker class independent of proliferative status , similar to factors related to the immune system response [ 37 ] . Figure 2 . High macroH2A1 . 1 expression level in breast cancer cell lines characterizes Claudin - low molecular subtype .

MacroH2A1 was identified as an epigenetic barrier which participates in the maintainance of cell identity and antagonizes induction of cell reprogramming to naive pluripotency [ 38 , 39 ] . Thus , macroH2A1 . 1 could be involved in the maintenance of a mesenchymal state , partial or complete , by establishing an epigenetic barrier against further de / differentiation . The difficulty of identifying EMT - transitioning cells in vivo creates skepticism regarding the pathological relevance of EMT . One explanation for this is that cancer cells only undergo a transient EMT , reverting back to the epithelial state by a mesenchymal - epithelial transition ( MET ) , making it difficult to isolate cells with true EMT markers . Studies in experimental mouse models have shown that a complete EMT - MET cascade is important for tumor metastasis [ 40 , 41 ] . If the EMT process is so transient and , in parallel , so important for the development of metastatic tumors , why do only claudin - low and , to a lesser extent , metaplastic intrinsic molecular subtypes of BC present molecular features of EMT ? One explanation could be that in claudin - low tumors the EMT - MET turnover is trapped in an intermediate mesenchymal state , in which EMT markers are present . We Figure 3 .

Hence , macroH2A1 . 1 expression could divert EMT - MET processes , stop progression and trap cells in such an intermediate state . High macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratios in the slow cycling claudin - low molecular subtype [ 31 ] are correlated with earlier observa - tions that macroH2A1 . 1 expression may be restricted to non - proliferative tissues [ 42 ] , and that loss of its expression in lung and colon cancer was related to enhanced cell proliferation of cancer cells [ 24 – 26 ] . In the 67NR mouse model which formed primary carcinomas when implanted into mouse mammary fat pads , Dardenne et al . , identified a high macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 ratio . Inversely , in the 4T1 mouse model , reduced macroH2A1 . 1 expression was correlated with macroscopic metastatic capacity in the lung [ 43 ] . Our results point to high macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 ratios as markers of engaged but paused intermediate cellular stages of the EMT . Because the metastasic power of a tumor clearly depends on a complete EMT - MET process , it is tempting to propose a model in which macroH2A1 . 1 is linked to the EMT process and macroH2A1 . 2 linked to the MET process .

The lack of identified molecular targets in the majority of TNBCs implies that chemotherapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with TNBCs . Here we show that , regardless of the reason that led to an absence of adjuvant therapy for patients involved in the GSE31519 study , those with a high macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio have a worse prognosis than those with a low one . Even if this observation clearly needs to be confirmed with a larger cohort , it is tempting to propose that assessing macroH2A1 . 1 expression levels will allow the identifica - tion of TNBC patients who , despite favorable clinic - pathological variables such as lymph node status or tumour size at initial presentation , will have a worse prognosis and may benefit from treatment . Interestingly , EMT and cell dissemination , although long associated with advanced stage of tumor progression , can be found at pre - neoplastic developmental stages of tumors [ 44 ] . Identifying early EMT process in primary tumors could then allow detection of tumors progressing towards metastasis . As expression of macroH2A1 . 1 seems to be correlated with EMT and unfavorable behavior in untreated TNBC patients , it is tempting to suggest macroH2A1 . 1 expression levels as an early biomarker of tumor genesis . No difference in survival of patients who underwent adjuvant treatment was seen with respect to the macroH2A1 . 1 / macroH2A1 mRNA ratio . But , as the ratios of this sub - cohort are already globally higher than in untreated tumors ( Fig . S4 ) , one could speculate that clinico - pathological parameters that initially led to treatment may already correlate with higher macroH2A1 . 1 / Figure 6 . Kaplan Meier analysis according to the macroH2A1 . 1 mRNA ratio in untreated and treated sub - cohort .

It will be interesting to analyse this more in depth in a larger cohort . In conclusion , it will be tempting to test if the correlation between macroH2A1 . 1 expression levels and EMT markers or poor prognosis in a TNBC cohort could be linked to a role for macroH2A1 . 1 in the maintenance of a transient cellular state in the early EMT process towards metastatic development of breast tumors .
