Despite a wealth of biochemical studies , the effects of mechanical forces on podosome integrity and dynamics are poorly understood . Here , we show that podosomes are highly sensitive to two groups of physical factors . First , we describe the process of podosome disassembly induced by activation of myosin - IIA filament assembly . Next , we find that podosome integrity and dynamics depends upon membrane tension and can be experimentally per - turbed by osmotic swelling and deoxycholate treatment . We have also found that podosomes can be disrupted in a reversible manner by single or cyclic radial stretching of the substratum . We show that disruption of podo - somes induced by osmotic swelling is independent of myosin - II filaments . The inhibition of the membrane sculpting protein , dynamin - II , but not cla - thrin , resulted in activation of myosin - IIA filament formation and disruption of podosomes . The effect of dynamin - II inhibition on podosomes was , however , independent of myosin - II filaments . Moreover , formation of organized arrays of podosomes in response to microtopographic cues ( the ridges with triangular profile ) was not accompanied by reorganization of myosin - II filaments . Thus , mechanical elements such as myosin - II filaments and factors affecting membrane tension / sculpting independently modulate podosome formation and dynamics , underlying a versatile response of these adhesion structures to intracellular and extracellular cues . This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Forces in cancer : interdisciplinary approaches in tumour mechanobiology’ . 1 . Introduction Podosomes are a distinct type of integrin - mediated cell – matrix adhesion typically seen in cells of monocytic origin ( dendritic cells [ 1 , 2 ] , macrophages [ 3 ] and osteo - clasts [ 4 ] but also foundmore recentlyin avarietyofothercell types [ 5 – 8 ] ) . Inearly studies , podosomes were also found in some types of cancer cells ( Src - transformed fibroblasts [ 9 , 10 ] ) . Thus , podosomes could be considered as a ubiquitous category of integrin - based matrix adhesion structures , whose participation in cancer cell invasion and metastasis is now well documented [ 11 , 12 ] . Analogous to another class of integrin - based adhesions , focal adhesions , podosomes are membrane specializations in which clusters of integrin family & 2019 The Author ( s ) Published by the Royal Society . All rights reserved . transmembrane receptors are connected to actin filaments . While both integrin receptors themselves and numerous pro - teins linking the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors with the actin cytoskeleton are similar in podosomes and focal adhesions , the organization of the actin core is different in these types of structures . Focal adhesions are peripheral ter - mini of actin bundles known as stress fibres and the actin scaffold of focal adhesions also consists of bundles of parallel actin filaments [ 13 – 15 ] . Actin filaments of focal adhesions are associated via numerous links containing talin and vinculin , with clusters of integrins located immediately underneath the actin filament layer [ 16 ] . The major nucleators of actin fila - ments in focal adhesions are thought to be formins [ 15 , 17 – 20 ] even though the Arp2 / 3 complex plays an important regulat - ory role , especially at the early stage of focal adhesion formation [ 21 , 22 ] . By contrast , the actin core of podosomes is formed mainly via Arp2 / 3 - driven branching actin polymeriz - ation , and the Arp2 / 3 complex along with its activators WASP / N - WASP are essential components of podosomes [ 23 – 25 ] . In addition , podosomes contain a number of other actin - interacting proteins missing in focal adhesions , such as cortactin [ 26 ] , gelsolin [ 27 ] , cofilin [ 28 , 29 ] and dynamin - II [ 30 , 31 ] . Unlike focal adhesions , the clusters of integrin receptors are located not underneath the actin core but at its periphery forming an approximately ring - shaped structure [ 32 – 34 ] . Formins seem to play a less important role in podosome formation than the Arp2 / 3 complex , though the radial filaments connecting the podosome core with proteins of the adhesive ring are postulated to be nucleated by formins [ 35 , 36 ] . The formation and dynamics of focal adhesions strongly depend on physical forces developed in the course of cell inter - actions with the extracellular matrix . Treatment of cells with diverse inhibitors interfering with myosin - II filament assembly or mechanochemical activity , as well as knockdown of myosin - IIA , results in disassembly of mature ( but not nascent ) focal adhesions [ 37 – 40 ] . Moreover , application of external mechanical forces to focal adhesions can promote their growth , while plating on soft or fluid substrates , which do not support development of traction forces by cells , is not favourable for focal adhesion formation [ 17 , 41 , 42 ] . Focal adhesion maturation from initial nascent adhesions , as well as their further growth , depend on myosin - IIA filament mechanochemical and cross - linking activity as well as on polymerization and bundling of actin filaments [ 19 , 43 ] . Centri - petal traction forces required for focal adhesion growth emerge due to the coupling of centripetal actin flow to integrin clusters via a stick - slip clutch mechanism [ 44 – 46 ] . The formation of myosin - II filament superstructures ( stacks ) [ 47 ] may also play a role in organization of the actin bundles in the lamellum and focal adhesion maturation . The formation and maintenance of podosomes depends on different mechanical requirements compared to focal adhesions . In particular , podosome formation can efficiently proceed in cells plated on fluid - supported lipid bilayer membrane , a substrate which does not permit development of traction forces exerted on integrin clusters [ 8 , 48 ] . More - over , fibroblast - type cells , which normally form focal adhesions on stiff matrix , switch to forming podosomes after being plated onto fluid substrates [ 8 ] . Thus , podosomes appear to self - assemble by default under conditions of depri - vation of traction forces , while focal adhesions critically depend on development of such forces . In agreement with this premise , recent experimental evidence shows that myosin - II filaments play an inhibitory rather than stimulatory role in podosome formation . Acti - vation of myosin - IIA filament formation by a number of pathways converging to the Rho / ROCK signalling axis [ 49 – 52 ] as well as depletion of the regulatory protein S100A4 [ 53 ] promote podosome disassembly . Proteins known as supervillin and LSP - 1 ( lymphocyte - specific protein - 1 ) appear to control the disruptive effect of myosin - IIA on podosomes by regulating the recruitment of myosin - IIA to the podosome environment [ 49 , 50 ] . Last but not least , unlike focal adhesions , which are essen - tially planar structures , podosomes are known to be small uniform membrane protrusions . This protrusional activity of podosomes is especially evident when cells are attached to soft deformable substrata [ 8 , 54 – 56 ] . This means that the processes of membrane sculpting would play an important role in the formation and dynamics of podosomes . Indeed , several proteins known to be potent regulators of membrane sculpting , such as dynamin - II [ 30 , 31 ] , and several BAR domain proteins [ 30 , 57 – 60 ] are localized to podosomes and often required for their formation . The effects of mechanical deformation of membrane and factors affecting membrane tension on podosome formation are , however , not much studied . Furthermore , the relationship between myosin - II - driven podosome remodelling and factors affecting membrane sculpting has not yet been investigated . The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of different categories of external and internal mechanical forces applied to podosomes . We paid special attention to factors affecting membrane tension as well as processes of membrane sculpting . We show that the effects of factors affecting mem - brane tension and sculpting on podosomes are independent of the effects of myosin - IIA filaments . We also found that , unlike focal adhesions , podosomes are highly sensitive to sub - strate stretching and demonstrate unique dependence on substrate topography . Altogether , our results clearly show that podosome formation and dynamics are regulated by two groups of mechanical factors , one operating via myosin - IIA filaments and the other being membrane deformations . This sheds a new light on the unique role of podosome - type adhesions in cell migration and environmental sensing as well as in cancer invasion and metastasis . 2 . Results ( a ) Disruptive effect of myosin - II filament assembly on podosome integrity The antagonism between myosin - II filaments overproduction and podosome formation was documented in previous studies [ 49 – 53 ] , but the mechanism underlying this antagon - ism is insufficiently understood . Here , we studied the time course of podosome disruption upon activation of myosin - II filament assembly under conditions when localization of podosomes is defined by a micropatterned substrate ( figure 1 a – d ; electronic supplementary material , movie S1 ) . We plated THP1 cells differentiated into macrophages by TGF b 1 treatment on micropatterned surfaces consisting of 4 m m diameter adhesive islands coated with fibronectin sep - arated by non - adhesive space ( figure 1 b ) . Under such conditions , the podosomes of adherent cells are concentrated r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c .

Of note , the intensity of fibronectin fluorescence was significantly lower in zones of the islands underlying podosome clusters , presumably due to podosome - mediated matrix degradation ( figure 1 c ) . The myosin - II filaments in THP1 cells were located at the cell periphery but can also be found in the rims surrounding podosome clusters ( figure 1 c ) . The addition of the RhoA activator , CN03 ( Cytoskeleton , Inc ; see also [ 61 ] ) , triggered myosin - II filament formation within 2 min .

The relocation of myosin - II filaments to within 2 m m of podosomes rapidly instigated podosome elimination ( figure 1 d ; electronic supplementary material , movie S1 ) . Detailed examination of images and movies revealed that the filaments never overlap with exist - ing podosomes . Overall , our data suggest that podosomes disappear as a result of local remodelling of the actin network in their microenvironment induced by myosin - II filaments . ( b ) Osmotic swelling disperses podosomes and promotes their disassembly THP1cellswereexposedtoRPMImediawith10 % serumdiluted by water to 50 % or 90 % dilutions ( 0 . 5 (cid:2) or 0 . 1 (cid:2) hypotonic , respectively ) for 15 min . Such treatments are known to increase membranetension [ 62 – 65 ] . Cells incubated with 0 . 5 (cid:2) hypotonic medium showed reductions in podosome number when com - pared with cells treated with isotonic medium ( figure 2 a , b , d , e ) . The sparse residual podosomes were approximately fivefold smaller in area than podosomes in control cells ( figure 2 b , f ; elec - tronic supplementary material , figure S1A , C , D and movie S2 ) as revealed by structured - illumination microscopy ( SIM ) . The cells demonstrated numerous lamellipodia and increased spread area ( figure 2 f ) . The effect of 0 . 5 (cid:2) hypotonic medium on podosomes was transient , so that new podosomes appeared within an hour following medium dilution . This is in line with the observations that the effect of hypo - tonic medium on membrane tension is transient [ 66 ] . Incubation in 0 . 1 (cid:2) hypotonic medium ( 90 % dilution ) resulted in cell retraction and formation of numerous irregular actin - rich protrusions ( figure 2 c ) . Such cells do not demonstrate any podosome - like structures for several hours . Since we demonstrated above that podosome disruption is induced by activation of myosin - II filament formation , we examined whether elimination of myosin - II filaments interfered with the effect of hypoosmotic shock . We found that in spite of complete disassembly of myosin - II filaments upon treatment with 30 m M Rho kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 , the 0 . 5 (cid:2) hypotonic medium still disrupts podosomes ( figure 2 g ; electronic sup - plementary material , movie S3 ) . Unlike podosomes , focal adhesions of mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) did not dis - assemble upon hypoosmotic shock ( figure 2 h ; electronic supplementary material , movie S4 ) . ( c ) Decreasing membrane tension by deoxycholate promoted the clustering of podosomes In order to decrease membrane tension without perturbing the spread area of the cell , small concentrations of the detergent deoxycholate were used to expand the lipid bilayer [ 64 ] . The addition of 400 m M deoxycholate induced immediate disrup - tion of podosomes , which however quickly recovered with the formation of large podosome clusters ( figure 3 a , b , f ; elec - tronic supplementary material , movie S5 ) . As a result , by 5 min following deoxycholate addition , podosome number was similar to that in non - treated cells , but their organization differed significantly . Instead of individual podosomes evenly distributed over the cell ventral surface , podosomes in deoxy - cholate - treated cells were organized into clusters containing more than 50 podosomes each ( figure 3 c , d ) . Visualization of podosomes with high magnification using SIM revea - led thin actin links connecting neighbouring podosomes in control cells . Such links were significantly shortened or entirely disappeared in the podosome clusters formed in deoxycholate - treated cells ( figure 3 b inset , e ) . The average distance between individual podosomes in the cluster was 0 . 24 + 0 . 02 m m compared with 0 . 54 + 0 . 04 m m in controls , so podosomes were tightly packed ( figure 3 e ) . There were no differences in actin core diameter or actin fluorescence intensity between podosomes in deoxycholate - treated and control cells ( electro - nic supplementary material , figure S1B , C , D ) . The clustering effect induced by deoxycholate was , however , transient and podosomes returned to a normal distribution at about 30 min after addition of deoxycholate ( figure 2 g ; electronic supplementary material , movie S6 ) . ( d ) Inhibition of dynamin - II but not clathrin - mediated endocytosis perturbed podosome formation Since physical factors increasing membrane tension are known to inhibit endocytosis [ 63 , 67 – 70 ] , we considered whether processes of endocytosis are involved in podosome formation and maintenance . First , we confirmed and extended previous data on the role of dynamin - II in podo - somes [ 30 ] showing that inhibition of dynamin - II either by pharmacological inhibitor ( dynasore ) or by knockdown of dynamin - II , resulted in severe disruption of podosomes in THP1 cells and the formation of focal adhesions instead ( figure 4 a – i ) . Inspection of myosin - II organization in cells with dynamin - II inhibition revealed that such cells have significantly increased numbers of myosin - II filaments ( figure 4 c , g ) when compared with functional dynamin - II - containing THP1 cells . These myosin - II filaments occupied the entire cytoplasm of dynasore - treated or dynamin - II knockdown cells but did not form regular myosin - II filament stacks ( figure 4 c , g ) . Since we have shown above that accumu - lation of myosin - II filaments leads on its own to podosome disruption , we examined whether accumulation of myosin - II filaments participate in the podosome disruption induced by dynamin - II inhibition . When dynasore was added to THP1 cells pre - treated with ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 for 30 min , podosomes were still disrupted in spite of the complete absence of myosin - II filaments in these cells ( figure 4 d ) . Of note , focal adhesions typical for dynasore - treated cells did not form in cells pre - treated with Y - 27632 ( figure 4 c , d ) . Similarly , treatment with Y - 27632 was insufficient to rescue podosomes in dynamin - II knockdown THP1 cells ( figure 4 g ) . These data strongly suggest that accumulation of myosin - II filaments did not participate in the disruption of podosomes induced by dynamin - II suppression . We found that dynamin - II is localized to the podosome adhesive ring ( electronic supplementary material , figure S2 ) , while clathrin light chain marked patches that do not overlap with podosomes . In addition , while dynamin inhibition showed a severe disruptive effect on podosomes , the inhibi - tor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis via Pitstop w 2 did not interfere with podosome integrity in our experiments ( electronic supplementary material , figure S2A – C ) . ( e ) Radial stretching of the substrate induces loss of podosomes Membrane tension can also be augmented by physical stretching of the substrate to which the cell is attached [ 63 , 71 ] .

The podosomes did not recover until the stretch was released ; following stretch release , both the re - assembly of podosomes and the disappearance of the blebs were seen , with complete recovery of the control phe - notype in 30 min following the release of the stretch ( figure 5 c ) . Cycles of substrate stretching and release can be repeated sev - eral times with reproducible reverse responses of podosomes and blebs . The results were not affected if the duration of single stretch was increased up to 1 min , and cyclic stretch fre - quency varied from 0 . 01 to 0 . 1 Hz . Collectively , the data show that podosomes respond strongly to the magnitude of stretch but not to the duration of a single stretch or frequency of cyclic stretch , and cells are capable of forming new podosomes once the strain is released ( figure 5 f , g ) . ( f ) Formation of linear podosome arrays induced by substrate topography Another group of physical factors affecting podosome for - mation are topographical features of the substrate . It was shown previously that podosomes of dendritic cells prefer to form in the proximity of 90 8 steps on the substrate [ 72 ] or can be induced by pores in the nuclearpore TM filters [ 73 ] . To further explore the effects of three - dimensional topogra - phy on podosome organization , THP1 cells were plated on arrays of microfabricated parallel ridges . The ridges have the shape of a triangular prism ( figure 6 a ) with varied widths , heights and distance between them ( pitch ) ( figure 6 b ) . We have found that cells plated on fibronectin - coated substrates with such ridges showed highly ordered podosome formation , which formed single or double chains along edges of the triangular ridges regardless of their heights or the spacing between them ( figure 6 c – f ) . Cells were capable of forming multiple streaks of single or double chains of podo - somes depending on the spacing between the ridges ( figure 6 c – f ) . If the distance between the ridges was large , podosomes could also be formed at the flat areas between the ridges . However , the distance between neighbouring podosomes oriented along the ridges was always smaller than between those on the flat surface .

B 374 : 2018022 8 8 apparently fused with each other ( figure 6 c ) . This suggests that sensing local topography can favour the assembly of podosomes . Examination of distribution of myosin - IIA filaments in cells on the patterned substrates revealed that filaments remained at the cell periphery , forming a subcortical ring similar to that seen in cells on a flat substrate ( figure 6 c ) . This suggests that formation of podosome arrays at the edges of the triangular ridges is not a consequence of reorganization of myosin - IIA filaments . Moreover , podosomes formed in cells treated with the microtubule - disrupting drug nocodazole and Rho kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 still aligned along the ridges ( electronic supplementary material , figure S3 ) . These cells had only a few residual microtubules associated with the micro - tubule organizing centre and completely lacked myosin - II filaments , showing that neither microtubules nor myosin - II filaments are required for the alignment of podosomes along topographical cues . 3 . Discussion In this study , we explored the effects of several types of fac - tors on the integrity of podosomes in macrophage - type cells . We confirmed and extended the disruptive effect of 2 µm line width , 4 µm pitch ( h = 1 . 4 µm ) 1 µm line width , 4 µm pitch ( h = 0 . 7 µm ) 4 µm line width , 10 µm pitch ( h = 2 . 8 µm ) 4 µm line width , 20 µm pitch ( h = 2 . 8 µm ) pitch h gap line width phalloidin vinculin MHCIIA BF triangular ridges ( e ) ( f ) ( b ) ( a ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 6 . Podosome formation in response to topographical cues . ( a ) Scanning electron microscopy image of PDMS substrate with triangular ridges . ( b ) Schematic diagram of profile of the substrate with triangular ridges . The PDMS substrate was coated with fibronectin ( 1 m g ml 2 1 ) for 1 h . The width of the ridges , distances between them ( pitch ) and ridges’ height ( h ) were varied as shown in ( c – f ) . In each panel , four views of the same cell are presented : actin cores visualized by phalloidin staining ( upper left , red ) , podosome adhesive domains visualized by vinculin staining ( upper right , green ) , distribution of myosin - IIA filaments ( lower left , purple ) and bright field image of the cell ( lower right ) . Scale bars , 5 m m . Note that in all cases , podosomes are aligned along both sides of the ridges , and not formed in other regions of the cell . At the substrate with smallest ridges ( pitch : 1 m m ) , the discrete actin cores are seen but vinculin is not organized into ring - shaped structures . At pitches 2 – 20 m m , chains of typical podosomes are seen . Myosin - IIA filaments are located at the cell periphery similarly to the case of cells plated on planar substrate .

B 374 : 2018022 8 9 myosin - IIA filaments on podosomes . By direct observation of the interaction of small groups of podosomes with surround - ing myosin - IIA filaments , we found that activation of myosin - II filament formation affects podosomes locally , and the distance at which myosin - II filaments exert their effect is in the micrometre range . The process of podosome disassembly upon local activation of myosin - II filament formation was rapid and lasted less than a minute . The dis - assembly of myosin - II filaments , known to have a profound disruptive effect on focal adhesion integrity [ 17 , 37 – 40 ] , does not affect podosomes . There are several not necessarily mutually exclusive mechanisms by which excessive assembly of myosin - II fila - ments can interfere with podosome integrity . Myosin - II filaments under certain conditions can depolymerize actin [ 74 , 75 ] or disintegrate branching actin networks nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Forces generated through inter - action of myosin - II and actin filaments may therefore interfere with the Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization in podosomes . Finally , myosin - II filaments underlying the plasma membrane could affect membrane tension or curvature [ 76 , 77 ] in such a way that hinders the formation of podosomal protrusions . We therefore investigated the role of physical factors in regulation of podosome integrity and dynamics including those affecting membrane tension and sculpting . We have clearly shown that hypoosmotic shock , known to transiently increase membrane tension [ 66 ] , results in transient disassem - bly of podosomes . Of note , suppression of myosin - II filament formation by Rho kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 does not prevent or rescue the disruptive effect of hypoosmotic shock on podosomes . The decrease in membrane tension by treatment with deoxycholate also exerts a profound effect on podo - somes resulting in podosome clustering . Dynamin - II , known for its function in membrane fission [ 78 ] and regulation of actin polymerization [ 79 ] , is required for podosome integrity [ 30 , 31 ] . We checked whether the dis - ruptive effect of dynamin - II inhibition on podosomes is mediated by myosin - IIA filament formation . This conjecture was motivated by our observation that treatment of THP1 cells with the dynamin inhibitor , dynasore , triggered the for - mation of multiple myosin - IIA filaments . However , inhibition of myosin - IIA filament formation by Rho kinase inhibitor did not prevent the disruptive effect of either dyna - min inhibition or dynamin - II knockdown on podosomes . Thus , not all podosome - disrupting factors operate via myosin - II filaments and , in particular , manipulations with membrane tension or sculpting can affect podosomes directly . We further investigated the effects of single or cyclic substrate stretching on podosome integrity and clearly showed that such manipulations result in reversible dis - assembly of podosomes . This effect can be explained by the increase in membrane tension upon stretching observed in previous studies [ 63 , 80 ] . However , in addition to membrane tension , the substrate stretching was shown to activate RhoA [ 81 ] and reinforce contractility [ 82 ] which suggests that formation of myosin - IIA filaments is activated . Thus , the effect of substrate stretching on podosomes is most prob - ably a result of the combined action of increased membrane tension and augmented myosin - II filament formation . A common feature of all podosome - disrupting treatments discussed above is their inhibitory effect on endocytosis . Indeed , it is well documented that increase in membrane ten - sion via osmotic swelling inhibits endocytosis [ 63 , 67 , 69 , 83 ] . Substrate stretching is also known to interfere with endocyto - sis [ 63 ] . Finally , dynamin , a protein required for multiple forms of endocytosis [ 84 ] , is indispensible for podosome integrity . The sensitivity of podosomes to factors inhibiting endocytosis can be explained by the possible role of endocy - tosis in the membrane balance at podosomes . Podosomes seem to be the sites of intense insertion of new membrane required for both protrusional activity and exocytosis of ves - icles containing metalloproteinases degrading the extracellular matrix [ 11 ] . Therefore , compensatory endocyto - sis [ 85 ] could be needed for the maintenance of membrane equilibrium . Since inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocyto - sis did not affect podosome integrity in our experiments , the endocytosis that might be required for podosome integrity is probably clathrin - independent . Of note , the sensitivity of both endocytosis and podosome formation to similar experimental treatments could also reflect the similarity between the processes of endocytosis and podosome formation . In both cases , the mechanism depends on membrane remodelling mediated by the actin cytoskeleton . Further elucidation of this analogy is an interesting avenue for future studies . The unique dependence of podosome formation on substrate topography described in this study and previous publications [ 72 , 73 ] provides another example of podosome regulation . Indeed , we have found that alignment of podo - somes along the triangular ridges of microfabricated substrates is not accompanied by apparent changes in the dis - tribution of myosin - II filaments . Moreover , total disruption of myosin - II filaments did not prevent alignment of podosomes along the ridges . Thus , the podosome regulation by topogra - phical cues is myosin - II independent . However , this does not prove directly that the podosome alignment in this situation is regulated by membrane deformation or changes in mem - brane tension . Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of substrate topography - dependent regulation of podosomes . Summing up , our study revealed two groups of mechanisms affecting podosome integrity and dynamics involving myosin - IIA filament reorganization and membrane tension / shape changes , respectively . These mechanisms seem to be operating for podosomes rather than other types of integrin adhesions , such as focal adhesions . Further elucidation of these mechanisms will be important for understanding podosome - dependent processes where these are of important biological consequence , such as three - dimensional cell migration and tumour cell invasion . 4 . Material and methods ( a ) Cell culture , plasmid and transfection procedures THP1 human monocytic leukaemia cell line was obtained from the Health Protection Agency Culture Collections ( Porton Down , Salis - bury , UK ) and cultured using Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium ( RPMI - 1640 ) supplemented with 10 % HI - FBS and 50 m g ml 2 1 2 - Mercaptoethanol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at37 8 Cand5 % CO 2 . The suspension - cultured THP - 1 cells were differentiated into adherent macrophage - like cells with 1 ng ml 2 1 human recombi - nant cytokine TGF b 1 ( R & D Systems ) for either 24 or 48 h on fibronectin - coated glass substrates .

B 374 : 2018022 8 10 between the phenotype of cells stimulated for either 24 or 48 h was detected . The 35 mm ibidi ( cat . 81158 ) glass - bottomed dishes were coated with 1 m g ml 2 1 of fibronectin ( Calbiochem , Merck Millipore ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) for at least 1 h at 37 8 C , washed with PBS twice and incubated in complete medium containing TGF b 1 prior to seeding of cells . THP1 stably expressing GFP - b - actin ( described in Cox et al . [ 86 ] ) or stably co - expressing red - fluorescent protein ( RFP ) - Lifeact and human green - fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - myosin regulatory light chain ( MRLC ) ( described in Rafiq et al . [ 51 , 87 ] ) were used in all live experiments concerning podosome studies . For dynamin - II knockdown , THP1 cells were transfected with 100 nM of dynamin - II siRNA ( Dharmacon , ON - TARGET - plus SMARTpool siRNA , catalogue no . L - 004007 - 00 - 0005 ) . For control experiments , non - targeting pool siRNA ( Dharmacon , ON - TARGETplus , catalogue no . D - 001810 - 10 ) was used at a similar concentration . Cells were transfected using electroporation ( Neon Transfection System , Life Technologies ) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . Specifically , two pulses of 1400 V for 20 ms were used . Immortalized rptp - a ( þ / þ ) MEFs [ 88 ] , termed MEFs , were obtained from the Sheetz Laboratory ( Mechanobiology Institute , Singapore ) . MEFs were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium high glucose ( DMEM ) , supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated foetal bovine serum ( HI - FBS , Gibco ) , 1 % L - glutamine and 100 IU mg 2 1 penicillin – streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) at 37 8 C and 5 % CO 2 . MEFs were either seeded on fibronectin - coated 35 mm ibidi or 27 mm IWAKI ( Japan ) glass - bottomed dishes for 24 h post - transfection . For focal adhesion analysis , MEFs were transiently electropo - rated ( Neon Transfection System , Life Technologies ) with mCherry - Vinculin ( Dr Michael W . Davidson , Florida State University , FL , USA ) with a single pulse of 1400 V for 20 ms . ( b ) Immunofluorescence THP1 cells were fixed for 15 min with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS , washed twice in PBS , permeabilized for 10 min with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS and then washed twice again in PBS . For microtubule visualization , cells were fixed and simultaneously permeabilized for 15 min at 37 8 C in a mixture of 3 % PFA – PBS , 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 and 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS , and then washed twice with PBS for 10 min . Before immunostaining , samples were quenched for 15 min on ice with 1 mg ml 2 1 sodium borohydride in cytoskele - ton buffer ( 10 mM MES , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM glucose , pH 6 . 1 ) . Fixed cells were blocked with 5 % bovine serum albumin or 5 % FBS for 1 h at room temperature priortoincubationwiththefollowingprimaryantibodiesovernight at 4 8 C : anti - tubulin ( Sigma - Aldrich , catalogue no . T6199 , dilution 1 : 400 ) ; anti - vinculin ( Sigma - Aldrich , catalogue no . V9131 , dilution 1 : 400 ) ; anti - non - muscle heavy chain of myosin - IIA ( Sigma - Aldrich , catalogue no . M8064 , dilution 1 : 500 ) ; samples were washed with PBS three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 1 h at room temperature , followed by three washes in PBS . F - actin was visualized by Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , Phalloidin - TRITC ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . ( c ) Osmotic shock and drug treatments Pharmacological treatments were performed using the following concentrations of inhibitors or activators : 30 m M Y - 27632 dihy - drochloride ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 80 m M for dynasore ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 400 m M deoxycholate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 0 . 1 m g ml 2 1 Rho Activator II ( CN03 , Cytoskeleton ) and 1 m M nocodazole ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The duration of the treatment with the inhibi - tors was 1 h unless otherwise stated . In some cases , cells were pre - treated with one inhibitor for 30 min and then another inhibi - tor was added for an additional 1 h . For hypotonic experiments , cells were exposed to solutions containing complete medium diluted in sterile water at 1 : 1 ( 0 . 5 (cid:2) hypotonic ) or 1 : 9 ( 0 . 1 (cid:2) hypotonic ) using a perfusion chamber ( CM - B25 - 1 , Chamlide CMB chamber ) and the image was acquired just prior to the start of acquisition . ( d ) Micro - patterning of adhesive islands using UV - induced molecular adsorption Adhesive islands with a diameter of 4 m m were printed in square lattices with a period of 8 m m . Clean glass coverslips were sealed with NOA 73 liquid adhesive to plastic - containing dishes by UV treatment for 2 min , and were then treated with oxygen plasma for 5 min . The coverslips were coated with PLL - g - PEG ( PLL ( 20 ) - g [ 3 . 5 ] - PEG ( 5 ) , SuSoS AG , Du¨bendorf , Switzerland ) at 100 m g ml 2 1 in PBS for at least 8 h followed by multiple washes with PBS . For micropattern printing , the PRIMO system ( Alveole , France ) mounted on an inverted microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti - E , Japan ) equipped with a motorized scanning stage ( Physik Instrumente , Germany ) was used as Digital Micro - mirror Device ( DMD ) to create a UV pattern at 105 m m above the focal plane of the microscope . After alignment of specimen with the UV pattern by using the Leonardo software ( Alveole , France ) , a solution of photoinitiator ( PLPP , Alveole , France ) was incu - bated on the dishes . Depending on the UV exposure and time , the UV - activated photoinitiator molecules locally cleaved the PEG chains , which permits subsequent local deposition of pro - teins . The dishes were washed with PBS multiple times prior to incubation with labelled fibronectin ( Alexa 488 Fibronectin , Cytoskeleton , Inc . , 50 m g ml 2 1 ) or unlabelled fibronectin mixed with Fibrinogen Alexa 647 ( ThermoFisher Scientific , 50 m g ml 2 1 ) at a ratio of 20 : 1 for 10 min . After several washes with PBS , THP1 cells were plated on these micropatterned lattices for SIM imaging . ( e ) Cell stretching assay THP1 cells were subjected to 0 , 5 or 15 % single or cyclic radial stretch using the stretching device described in Cui et al . [ 71 ] . Briefly , cells were plated on a layer of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) coated with 10 m g ml 2 1 fibronectin , in a stretching unit . The substrate stretching was generated via changing the pressure in a chamber underneath the stretchable substrate . For single stretch experiments , cells were incubated under stretched conditions for 10 s , and then fixed as described above . The stretching itself lasted for less than a second [ 71 ] . For single stretch recovery experiments , cells were released from stretching 30 min prior to fixing . For cyclic stretching , cells were exposed to stretching with a frequency of 0 . 1 Hz at 5 or 15 % stretch magnitude and then fixed . ( f ) Fluorescence microscopy THP1 cells ( in figures 2 a – c and 5 ) and MEFs ( in figure 2 h ) were imaged in complete medium ( unless stated otherwise ) using a spinning - disc confocal microscope ( PerkinElmer Ultraview VoX ) attached to an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope , equipped with a 100 (cid:2) oil immersion objective ( 1 . 40 NA , UPlan - SApo ) and EMCCD camera ( C9100 - 13 , Hamamatsu Photonics ) for image acquisition . Volocity software ( PerkinElmer ) was used to control the image acquisition . For all other images , two types of SIM equipments were used : ( i ) spinning - disc confocal microscopy ( Roper Scientific ) coupled with the Live SR module [ 89 ] , Nikon Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope with Perfect Focus System , controlled by MetaMorph software ( Molecular device ) supplemented with a 100 (cid:2) oil 1 . 45 NA CFI Plan Apo Lambda r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il .

( g ) Microfabrication of triangular ridges The coverslips with PDMS structures on top were produced by adapting a moulding protocol from Migliorini et al . [ 90 ] . Silicon moulds 15 (cid:2) 15 mm 2 wide with 1 . 5 mm long trenches of triangu - lar cross - section with different sizes and pitch were prepared via silicon anisotropic etching . Briefly , standard single - side - polished silicon wafers with 300 nm of thermally grown SiO 2 were spin - coated with 1 m m thick AZ5214E - positive tone photo - resist . The pattern was then produced with direct writing in a DWL - 66fs Heidelberg laser writer equipped with a diode - laser - emit - ting light at 375 nm wavelength . After development for 1 min in AZ400 K diluted 1 : 4 in DI water , the patterned resist mask was then used to etch the silicon oxide layer in a Samco 10NR RIE tool using CF 4 / O 2 etching chemistry ( 40 / 4 sccm , respect - ively ) , 15 Pa , 150 W applied through an RF generator at 13 . 56 MHz , as described in Ashraf et al . [ 91 ] . After stripping the resist , 10 min of anisotropic etching in 5 M KOH at 80 8 C pro - duced the triangular trenches with the designed sizes . After the anisotropic etching , the silicon oxide was removed with immer - sion in a buffered oxide etching solution ( a solution of 1 : 7 of HF : NH 4 F in water ; this etching solution is selective for silicon oxide but does not attack Si ) . The wafer was then diced in the single dyes , and each was coated with an anti - sticking self - assembled monolayer of Trichloro ( 1H , 1H , 2H , 2H - perfluorooc - tyl ) silane by vapour deposition . PDMS ( Sylgard 184 , Dow Cornig , USA ) was prepared in 10 : 1 ratio with its reticulation agent and degassed for 30 min in a vacuum jar after careful mixing . A 10 m m layer was spin - coated on the coverslip ( 4000 rpm for 60 s ) and degassed a second time for 10 min . A silanized mould was then placed on top of the PDMS coating and gently pressed to the coverslip with around 150 kPa of pressure to facilitate the filling of the triangular cavities . While keeping the pressure applied , the assembly was transferred on a Hot Plate and the temperature raised to 120 8 C , where PDMS reti - culation was left to proceed for 30 min . After cooling down to room temperature , the silicon mould was peeled off revealing the struc - tured PDMS layer on top of the coverslip with the triangular ridges . Data accessibility .
