This article is published with open access at Springerlink . com Abstract Bone substitutes are being increasingly used in surgery as over two millions bone grafting procedures are performed worldwide per year . Autografts still represent the gold standard for bonesubstitution , though the morbidity and the inherent limited availability are the main limitations . Allografts , i . e . banked bone , are osteoconductive and weakly osteoinductive , though there are still concerns about the residual infective risks , costs and donor availability issues . As an alternative , xenograft substitutes are cheap , but their use provided contrasting results , so far . Ceramic - based synthetic bone substitutes are alternatively based on hydroxyapatite ( HA ) and tricalcium phosphates , and are widely used in the clinical practice . Indeed , despite being completely resorbable and weaker than cortical bone , they have exhaustively proved to be effective . Biomimetic HAs are the evolution of traditional HA and contains ions ( car - bonates , Si , Sr , Fl , Mg ) that mimic natural HA ( biomimetic HA ) . Injectable cements represent another evolution , enabling mininvasive techniques . Bone morphogenetic proteins ( namely BMP2 and 7 ) are the only bone inducing growth factors approved for human use in spine surgery and for the treatment of tibial nonunion . Demineralized bone matrix and platelet rich plasma did not prove to be effective and their use as bone substitutes remains controversial . Experimental cell - based approaches are considered the best suitable emerging strategies in several regenerative medi - cine application , including bone regeneration . In some cases , cells have been used as bioactive vehicles delivering osteo - inductive genes locally to achieve bone regeneration . In particular , mesenchymal stem cells have been widely exploited for this purpose , being multipotent cells capable of efﬁcient osteogenic potential . Here we intend to review and update the alternative available techniques used for bone fusion , along with some hints on the advancements achieved through the experimental research in this ﬁeld . 1 Introduction Bone substitutes are being increasingly used especially in oncologic surgery , traumatology , revision prosthetic sur - gery and spine surgery [ 1 ] . Bone grafting frequency is indeed the second most frequent tissue transplantation worldwide , coming right after blood transfusion . Over two millions bone grafting procedures are performed every year , with more than 500 , 000 implanted in the US alone [ 2 – 5 ] . This is due to their ease use and handling , improved safety proﬁles , intraoperative cost and time advantages , and adaptability to a variety of clinical challenges . The incorporation of a bone graft is deﬁned as the ‘‘pro - cess of envelopment and interdigitation of the donor bone tissue with new bone deposited by the recipient’’ [ 6 ] . This process follows a typical multistep cascade : initially , the bone graft produces a response leading to the accumulation of inﬂammatory cells , followed by the chemotaxis of host mesenchymal cells to the graft site . Thereafter , the primitive W . Lattanzi and G . Logroscino share senior authorship . V . Campana (cid:2) G . Milano (cid:2) E . Pagano (cid:2) G . Salonna (cid:2) G .

The additional processes of bone graft revascularization and necrotic graft resorption occur concurrently . Finally , bone production from the osteoblasts onto the graft’s three - dimensional framework occurs , followed by bone remodel - ing in response to mechanical stress [ 7 , 8 ] . A bone substitute can be deﬁned as ‘‘a synthetic , inorganic or biologically organic combination which can be inserted for the treatment of a bone defect instead of autogenous or allogenous bone’’ [ 9 ] . A wide variety of bone substitutes have been employed over the past 50 years . Bone substitutes can be broadly categorized into bone grafts ( autograft , allograft , xenograft ) , ceramics ( hydroxyapatite , TCP , cal - cium sulphate ) and growth factors ( DBM , PRP , BMP’S ) [ 10 ] . The ideal bone substitute should be biocompatible and not evoke any adverse inﬂammatory response . It should be easily molded into the bone defect within a short setting time . It should be osteoconductive , osteoinductive [ 11 ] and re - sorbable . It should be possibly traceable in vivo ; to this aim radiolucency is ideal to allow optimal radiographic assess - ment . Also , the ideal bone substitute should be thermally nonconductive , sterilizable , and readily available at a rea - sonable cost [ 12 ] . Although autologous bone grafting is still considered the ‘‘gold standard’’ in bony defect repair , the past century has seen signiﬁcant advances in the development of valid alternatives to natural bone . The latter half of the twentieth century has seen the evolution of the hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate - based cements and ceramics . Current advances are being made with the development of tissue - engineered products , incorporating growth factors and stem cells . Depending on the type of surgery and on the bone loss , many options are possible . Cortical strut grafts are used were mechanic strength is needed . Spongy bone , often morcelized , is more usefull to ﬁll cavitary bone defects or in spine fusion . Ceramics under granule , blocks , or mold - able paste shape are normally used to enhance bone heal , but have poor mechanical qualities and stable hardware ﬁxation is necessary . Growth factors are on the market as moldable paste . BMPs are currently indicated only in tibial non union ( BMP - 7 ) and spine surgery ( BMP - 2 ) . In this report we will review some of the most important biomaterials in each of these categories . 2 Bone grafts 2 . 1 Autografts Currently autografts are the ‘‘gold standard’’ in bone sub - stitution [ 13 , 14 ] . Autologous ( or autogenous ) bone grafting involves utilizing bone obtained from the same individual receiving the graft [ 15 ] . Bone can be harvested from non - essential bones , such as the iliac crest or the ﬁbula ( Fig . 1 ) , the chin , the ribs , the mandible and even parts of the skull . Autogenous bone possesses all the properties essential for bone formation : it is osteoconduc - tive and osteoinductive , and it houses growth factors and osteogenic cells with no associated immune or infective - related risks . Autologous bone fracts are slowly replaced by newly formed host bone . The disadvantages of auto - grafts reside in the inherent morbidity : ( 1 ) a surgical donor site is required , leading to possible post - operative pain and complications . [ 16 , 17 ] ; ( 2 ) a likelihood of blood loss or hematomas , infection , fracture , neurovascular injury , as well as cosmetic deformity , at the explantation site and longer operative time . Also , autogenous bone availability in a patient repre - sents a signiﬁcant limit , especially in pediatric patients and in the elderly . An autograft may also be performed without a solid bony structure , for example using bone reamed from the anterior superior iliac spine . In this case there is an osteoinductive and osteogenic action , however there is no mechanical support action , as there is no solid bony structure [ 18 ] . 2 . 2 Allografts Allograft biobanked bone represents a suitable alternative to autogenous bone , being derived from humans as well . Allograft bone can be collected from either living donors ( patients total hip replacement surgery ) or nonliving donors and must be processed within a bone tissue bank ( Fig . 2 ) . Bone Tissue Banks fastly grew up since the’80 years but doubts and concerns arise about costs and problems related to storing [ 19 ] . Donor bone is osteoconductive , weakly osteoinductive ( growth factors may still be present , depending on the pro - cessing ) . Also , allografts often require sterilization ( gamma - irradiation ) , with detrimental effects on mechanical proper - ties of bone , and deactivation of proteins normally found in healthy bone . Concerns on the potential infective risks were raised , though since 1989 only 2 documented cases of HIV were reported with a risk rate of 1 : 1 . 6 milions [ 20 ] . Anyway , current procedure for donor bone procurement and pro - cessing are designed to signiﬁcantly limit the possible transmission of knonw pathogens [ 21 ] . Other more important infective risk were reported on HBV ( 1 case ) , HCV ( 2 cases ) , one fatal infection by Clostridium Difﬁcilis , and 26 bacterial infections [ 22 – 24 ] . The limits of such transplants are costs , laborious proce - dure ( tissue processing , harvesting ) , mechanical resistance ( in freeze dried and irradiated ) , limited osteoinduction and risk of infection . 2446 J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 123 2 . 3 Xenografts Xenograft bone substitutes have their origin from a species other than human , such as bovine bone ( or porcine bone ) which can be freeze dried or demineralized and deprotei - nized ( Fig . 3 ) . Bovine bone was ﬁrst introduced by Maatz and Bauermeister in 1957 [ 25 ] . Xenografts are usually only distributed as a calciﬁed matrix .

Coral based xenografts are mainly calcium carbonate ( and an important proportion of ﬂuorides , useful in the context of grafting to promote bone development ) while natural human bone is made of hydroxyapatite along with calcium phosphate and carbonate . The coral material is thus either transformed industrially into hydroxyapatite through a hydrothermal process , yielding to a non - resorb - able xenograft , or simply the process is omitted and the coralline material remains in its calcium carbonate state for better resorption of the graft by the natural bone . The coral xenograft is then saturated with growth enhancing gels and solutions [ 27 ] . In January 2010 Italian scientists announced a breakthrough in the use of wood as a bone substitute , though this technique is not expected to be used for humans until at the earliest 2015 . Various species of wood are pyrolized in an inert atmosphere , the carbonaceous residue is saturated with calcium salts and ﬁnally reheated to obtain a highly porous crystallized material of much higher porosity than trabecular titanium or porous hard ceramic bone - substitutes ; the inventors claim the wood based material will permit better penetration during bone growth and more ﬂexion than metal or hard ceramic grafts [ 28 ] . Xenografts have given good results in dentistry , but scarce validation in orthopaedics . Clinically available coral - based products are Interpore and Pro - osteon ( Interpore International , Inc . , Irvine , CA ) as well as bovine derived products such as Bio - Oss ( Geistlich Biomaterials , Geistlich , Switzerland ) , Osteograf - N ( Cera - Med Co . , Denver , CO ) , and Endobon ( Merck Co . , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Doubts were argumented regard ‘‘zoonose’’ diseases transmitted from animals to humans , like BSE ( Bovine spongiform Encephalopathy ) or PERV ( Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses ) [ 29 ] . Results are contradictory with some authors reporting favourable data , but in the clinical practice xenografts are scarcely used [ 30 – 34 ] . Moreover poor results in hip surgery , with 25 % of pseudo infections complications , were recently reported [ 35 ] . The advantages are the easy availability , the osteocon - ductivity , the good mechanical properties and low costs . 3 Ceramics Generally ceramics bone substitutes are calcium based substitutes , a mix of HA ( Hydroxyapatite ) and TCP ( Tri - calcium . Phosphate ) , the amorphous phase of HA . HA is a relatively inert substance that is retained ‘‘in vivo ’’ for Fig . 3 a , b Bovine bone substitute ( Xenograft ) in chips and blocks shape . c The xenograft is clearly visible and not resorbed in a well bone healed proximal humeral fracture at 1 year of follow up . d Acetabular bone defect ﬁlled with the same material 2448 J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 123 prolonged periods of time , whereas the more porous TCP typically undergoes biodegradation within 6 weeks of its introduction into the area of bone formation . HA achieve very high mechanical strenght , while TCP has poor mechanical qualities . Generally the base is a biphasic cal - cium phosphate , which combine 40 – 60 % TCP with 60 – 40 % HA , that may yield a more physiological balance between mechanical support and bone resorption [ 36 ] . A level II and a level IV study found lesser pain , operating time , blood loss and complication in synthetic substitutes compared with iliac crest grafts [ 37 ] . Ceramics are widely known and are proved to be safe and effective in bone substitution . HA - TCP are now available in form of blocks , granules , and injectable kits . Macroporosity of about 100 – 400 l and interconnected porosity are necessary for bone ingrowth . Depending on the concentration of HA and TCP the strength is variable between 10 and 60 MP that is very lower than cortical bone compression strength ( 150 – 200 MP ) , and this is one of the major limit of cera - mic based biomaterials . 4 Hydroxyapatite and tricalcium phosphate Hydroxyapatite [ Ca 10 ( PO 4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 ] ( HA ) is the cristalline form of tricalcium phosaphate ( TCP ) and is the primary mineral component of teeth and bone . For the past 30 years , it has been popular in orthopaedic , craniofacial and orthog - nathic surgery , ﬁlling bony defects and smoothing contour irregularities . HA ceramics come in both naturally and synthetic forms . HA and TCP ceramics are manufactured in a variety of forms including granules and porous blocks ( Fig . 4 ) . TCP is more soluble than HA . Although HA accounts for nearly 70 % of the mineral content of teeth and bone , the occurring HA in the human body exists in a substituted form . Carbonate , silicates , and magnesium among other ions , may replace hydroxyl or phosphate groups of the apatite structure . Investigators have attempted to produce alginate [ 38 ] , strontium [ 39 ] , silicon [ 40 ] , carbonate and magnesium [ 41 – 46 ] substituted synthetic HA in an effort to produce HA that more closely resembles the mineral content of native bone , enhancing bioactivity and osteo - conduction ( Biomimetic ceramic substitutes ) [ 47 ] . Although there are few of products made of biomimetic HA in the clinical use at this time , the research is ongoing on this direction and biomimetic HA substitution will likely remain one of the most promising area of research . 5 Calcium phosphate cements Calcium phosphate cements ( CPC ) are synthetic bone substitutes that were invented in 1986 by Chow and Brown , scientists at the American Dental Association [ 48 ] . The cements are a white powder , consisting of calcium phos - phate , that when mixed with a liquid , forms a workable paste which can be shaped during surgery to ﬁt the con - tours of bone loss . The cements harden within 20 min . The hardening reaction , which forms nanocrystalline hydroxy - apatite ( HA ) is isothermic and occurs at physiologic pH so tissue damage does not occur during the setting reaction . CPCs were FDA approved for the treatment of non - load - bearing bone defects in 1996 . HA is the primary inorganic component of natural bone which makes the hardened cement biocompatible and osteoconductive . Over time , CPCs are gradually resorbed and replaced with new bone . Because CPCs are brittle , they are used for non - load - bearing applications such as dental , cranio - facial and orthopaedic applications . CPCs have two signiﬁcant advantages over pre - formed , sintered ceramics . First , the CPCs paste can be sculpted during surgery to ﬁt the cavi - ties . Second , the nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite structure of the CPC makes it osteoconductive causing it to be gradually resorbed and replaced with new bone . CPCs are injectable and were recently introduced in the clinical practice to adjuvate minimally invasive procedures ( MIS ) and tissue Sparing surgery ( TSS ) in order to reduce mor - bidity and costs ( Fig . 5 ) . The ﬁrst cement that was intro - duced on the market in the late 1990s was the Norian , by Cupertino ( Synthes - De - Puy ) , a self hardening carbonate HA , even known as ‘‘Dhallite’’ [ 49 ] . From then many other phosphate cements were pro - posed for clinical practice , like Bonesource ( Stryker ) , Calcibone ( Biomet ) , CrhonOs ( Synthes ) , Hydroset ( Syn - thes ) [ 50 ] , Sintlife ( Finceramica ) [ 47 ] , KyphOs ( Medronic ) . Recently the research on CPC has focused on improving mechanical properties , making premixed cements , making the cement macroporous and seeding cells and growth factors into the cement . 6 Calcium sulphate Calcium sulphate ( CS ) , even known as ‘‘gypsum’’ or ‘‘Plaster of Paris’’ , was ﬁrstly implanted in humans as a void ﬁller of tubercolous osteomyelitis by Dreesman in 1892 [ 51 ] . More recently it was reintroduced in the clinical practice as a bone substitute by Peltier in 1959 , in a more pure and crystalline form [ 52 – 54 ] CS is resorbed variably within 6 – 8 weeks . Proponents of calcium sulfate claim that the pellets provide an effective gap ﬁller , allow for vascular ingrowth , and resorb rapidly and completely , allowing for physiologic bone healing [ 55 ] . Apparently due to rapid graft resorption , the resulting calcium - rich ﬂuid incites inﬂammation . First reports showed very promising results J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 2449 123 in vitro [ 56 ] and ‘‘in vivo ’’ : Huff and Grisoni in the mouse [ 57 ] , Cunningham in the sheep [ 58 ] , Hadjiipavlou in the sheep [ 59 ] , Turner in the dog [ 60 ] , and also in humans [ 61 , 62 ] . Recently many adverse or no effects were reported , mainly explained because of the too fast resorption and the production of a similar inﬂammatory reaction without bone formation ( 13 – 18 % ) [ 63 – 67 ] ( Fig . 6 ) . Subsequently CS was proposed as a scaffold for demineralized bone matrix ( DBM ) . The mixture with CS enhanced the clinical out - come more than calcium sulfate alone . 7 Polymer - based bone graft substitutes Polymers have physical , mechanical , and chemical prop - erties completely different from the other bone substitutes . The polymers can be divided into natural polymers and synthetic polymers . These , in turn , can be divided further into degradable and nondegradable types . One of the most important natural polymer in bone is collagen . Cortoss is an injectable resin - based product with appli - cations for load - bearing sites [ 68 ] . It consists of 33 % difunctional methacrylates that form a highly cross - linked 3 - dimensional polymer , reinforced with 67 % radiopaque and bioactive glass ceramic particles . Initial results using Cortoss in vertebroplasty for osteoporotic and metastatic vertebral compression fractures were encouraging [ 69 ] . Degradable synthetic polymers ( i . e . , natural polymers ) are resorbed by the body . The beneﬁt is that they enhance healing without remaining foreign bodies . Degradable polymers such as polylactic acid and poly ( lactic - co - gly - colic acid ) have been used as standalone devices and as extenders of autografts and allografts .

The HA - TCP material resulted well osseoin - tegrated , but without any sign of resorption or bone substitution 2450 J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 123 Most research has been directed to poly lactic acid ( PLA ) , poly glycolic acid ( PGA ) and poly lactic - co - gly - colide ( PLGA ) copolymers . Tissue Regeneration Thera - peutics ( Toronto , Canada ) has developed a porous poly ( lactic - co - glycolic acid ) foam matrix by using a particu - late - leaching process to induce porosity . It is currently marketed under the trade name OsteoScaf . Immix ( Osteo - biologics , Smith and Nephew , Memphis , Tennessee ) and it is used as a graft extender [ 70 ] . The success of these has further led to the evaluation of aliphatic polyesters such as poly e - caprolactone ( PCL ) . It appears as semicrystalline polyester and is highly pro - cessable as it is soluble in a wide range of organic sol - vents . The uncommon things of PCL is its high thermal stability , with decomposition temperature ( Td ) of 350 (cid:3) C , whereas others aliphatic polyesters are between 235 and 255 (cid:3) C [ 71 ] . In bone engineering , PCL can be categorized as a promising biocompatible and biodegradable polymer since it is being used to enhance bone ingrowth and regeneration in the treatment of bone defects [ 72 , 73 ] , however , PCL is poorly used due to the slow degradation time [ 74 ] . 8 Composite materials 8 . 1 Composite of collagen and hydroxyapatite Bone is mainly made of collagen ( Col ) and carbonate substituted hydroxyapatite ( HA ) . Actually it is possible to obtain Col – HA by a self assembling process on a nano - metric scale [ 75 ] . Thus , an implant manufactured from such components is likely to behave better than other bone substitutes made as monolithic devices . Indeed , both collagen type I and hydroxyapatite were found to enhance osteoblast differ - entiation [ 76 ] , but combined together , they were shown to accelerate osteogenesis . A composite matrix when embedded with human - like osteoblast cells , showed better osteoconductive properties compared to monolithic HA and produced calciﬁcation of identical bone matrix [ 77 , 78 ] . In addition , Col - HA composites proved to be bio - compatible both in humans and in animals [ 77 , 79 ] . Moreover these composites have some mechanical advan - tages . The ductile properties of collagen help to increase the poor fracture toughness of hydroxyapatites . The Fig . 5 Injectable TCP cement bone substitutes : a – b injectable cements have the advantage to be mouldable and contourable to the bone loss in mininvasive or open surgery ; c bone loss in a distal tibial open fracture delayed union ( CT scan ) ; d 1 year X - ray control , showed bone consolidation and osseointegration of the TCP cement J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 2451 123 addition of a calcium / phosphate compound to collagen sheets gave higher stability , increased the resistance [ 80 ] and enhanced the mechanical ‘wet’ properties [ 81 ] . The direct comparison of other materials compared with Col – HA composites for bone substitutes have yet to be clearly investigated . However , increasing the biomimetic proper - ties of an implant may reduce the problems of bacterial infections associated with inserting a foreign body [ 82 ] . Evidence of the biological advantage compared to artiﬁcial polymeric scaffolds have been further demonstrated in cartilage regeneration [ 83 ] . The addition of collagen to a ceramic structure can provide other additional advantages to surgical applications : shape control , spatial adaptation , increased particle and defect wall adhesion , and the capa - bility to favor clot formation and stabilization [ 79 ] . Healos ( DePuy Orthopaedics , Inc , Warsaw , Ind ) is a natural polymer - based product , a polymer - ceramic composite consisting of collagen ﬁbers coated with hydroxyapatite and indicated for spinal fusions [ 84 ] . In summary therefore , combining both collagen and hydroxyapatite should provide an advantage over other materials for use in bone tissue repair [ 85 ] . Further clinical studies are required to validate its effectiveness . 9 Growth factors 9 . 1 Demineralized bone matrix The aseptical processing of banked donor bone to produce human demineralized bone matrix ( DBM ) , was ﬁrst described in 1975 [ 86 ] and introduced in the orthopedic and periodontal practice since the early 1980s . The decal - ciﬁed bone ( residual calcium \ 5 % ) is mainly represented Fig . 6 Calcium sulphate ( CS ) : a Pellets ﬁll the residual gap after DHS explant in a healed intertrochanteric fracture . b Two months after the CS was totally resorbed . c Antibiotic loaded CS pellets in a tibial osteomyelitis . d Three years CT scan control do not show any evidence of bone regeneration . No signs of CS were founded while the infection was healed 2452 J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 123 by the collagen matrix that is supposed to replicate the tridimensional architecture of bone , hence facilitating and guiding host cell invasion , growth and differentiation [ 87 ] . Moreover DBM should retaining bone - inducing growth factors , such as bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMP ) , insulin growth factor ( IGF ) , transforming growth factor ( TGF ) , ﬁbroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , able to stimulate activation and migration of osteogenic stem cells and progenitor cells , and to induce revascularization . None - theless , DBM lacks of any mechanical strength , hence are used exclusively for ﬁlling purposes and normally are associated with carriers like glycerol ( Grafton - Osteotech ) , calcium sulphate ( Allomatrix - Whright ) , hyaluronic acid ( DBX - Synthes ) , porcine collagen ( Osteoﬁl - Medtronics - Sofamor Danek ) , carbossimetilcellulose ( Dynagraft - Gen - Sci Regeneration Sciences ) ( Fig . 7 ) . Despite a copious amount of literature data reports the effectiveness of DBM , mostly in preclinical studies [ 20 ] , as a safe and effective bone grafting material [ 88 ] , there is still limitate evidence produced in Level 1 - 2 studies , to support the use of DBM as a stand - alone bone substitute [ 89 ] . Moreover , concerns were raised about the extreme variability in BMP 2 and BMP 7 content in different commercially available DBM lots , which may be due to the absence of standardized processes for production along with donor - related issues [ 89 , 90 ] . 9 . 2 Platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) Blood platelets are easily collected from blood and repre - sent a valuable source of growth factors , such as the platelet derived growth factor , the insulin - like growth Fig . 7 Demineralized Bone Matrix ( DBM ) : a – c Complex proximal humeral fracture treated by ORIF , DBM and calcium sulphate ( Allomatrix - Wright ) ; d One year follow up demonstrate good consolidation of the fracture J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 2453 123 factors , and the transforming growth factors [ 91 – 93 ] . Platelet - rich plasma ( PRP ) is easily obtained by concen - tration of autologous blood platelet through gradient den - sity centrifugation ( Fig . 8 ) . PRP proved to exert chemotactic and mitogenic properties for osteoblast and ﬁbroblast cells in vitro , to stimulate ﬁbroblast hyaluronate synthesis , a pre requisite for the formation of the extra - cellular matrix , thereby enhancing bone formation [ 94 – 98 ] . Unfortunately , diverse clinical studies so far reported unsuccessful results in spine surgery , with a decreased incidence of spine fusions ( 15 – 19 % ) , even when used in combination with bone marrow cells [ 99 ] . This failure was believed to be due to a paradoxical inhibitory effect on BMP 2 at high concentrations [ 100 – 102 ] . Indeed , currently PRP is not validated as a stand - alone bone substitute but is rather considered a co - growth factor for bone healing . 9 . 3 Bone morphogenetic proteins Originally identiﬁed and named after their ability to induce ectopic bone formation [ 103 ] , bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) represent a wide and heterogeneous family of highly conserved secreted proteins , within the transforming growth factor - b superfamily , deeply involved in the skel - etogenic process [ 104 , 105 ] . Selected BMPs appear to promote in vitro bone forma - tion by : inducing the differentiation of pluripotent me - senchimal cells towards the chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages , stimulating angiogenesis and alkaline phospha - tase activity [ 94 ] . The osteogenic / osteoinductive potential of the BMPs was strongly validated in both preclinical and clinical studies , generally reporting performance that were comparable to autogenous cancellous bone , with fusion rates between 80 and 99 % [ 106 – 112 ] . To date , only the use of recombinant human BMP2 and BMP7 has been approved both in Europe and the United States for selected clinical applications : BMP 2 with a collagen carrier ( INFUSE , Medtronic Sofamor Danek , Minneapolis ) for lumbar vertebral interbody fusion and BMP 7 ( OP - 1 , Stryker , Kalamazoo , Michigan ) for tibial non union , in patients who underwent previous unsucces - full treatments . Dark and lights persist also due to the variable needed dosage , which may be patient - and site - dependent , and to the still high costs , which makes their use prohibitive in most settings . In addition , BMPs showed adverse effect in cervical spine and are hence contraindi - cated in this application [ 113 ] .

Although mimicking the geometric architecture of bone in a synthetic scaffold has been shown to promote favorable cellular activity , the overall capacity for a scaffold to direct cell behavior can be substantially improved through the controlled delivery of bio speciﬁc cues [ 114 – 119 ] . Administration of growth factors and other bioactive molecules to promote bone formation and repair has achieved promising results in several preclinical and clin - ical models [ 120 – 125 ] . A variety of administration meth - ods have been investigated including : bolus injection , surface adsorbed protein release , osmotic pumps , and controlled release from biodegradable scaffolds . The efﬁ - cacy of the delivery vehicle relies on its ability to provide the appropriate dose over the appropriate therapeutic time . Ideally , the presentation of bioactive molecules or drugs must be ﬁnely tuned to dynamically match the physiolog - ical needs of the tissue as it regenerates . Because of the hydrolytically unstable linkages in their backbone and tunable biodegradation rate , polymers have demonstrated to be effective . Ceramic materials have also demonstrated the ability to biodegrade and release bioactive molecules at a controlled rate [ 126 – 130 ] . Natural polymers such as collagen , ﬁbrin , alginate , gelatin , and GAGs have also been extensively investigated as drug delivery vehicles in bone tissue engineering . These natural polymers have distinct advantages due to their inherent biocompatibility and bioactivity but lack the mechanical properties required for load bearing applications , may have inappropriate ( ﬁxed ) degradation rates , are difﬁcult to harvest and sterilize , and may induce an immunogenic response . Bioactive mole - cules can be covalently bound to polymers or physically entrapped inside a polymer matrix [ 131 , 132 ] . In either case , the molecule is released as the polymer degrades in the physiological environment . Aliphatic polyesters such as poly ( lactic - acid ) ( PLA ) , poly ( glycolic - acid ) ( PGA ) , and poly ( caprolactone ) ( PCL ) , and their copolymers are the most commonly utilized polymers in bone tissue engineering [ 133 – 135 ] . Both PGA and PLA scaffolds has been investigated as a slow - delivery carrier for growth factors in several ‘‘in vitro’’ and ‘‘in vivo’’ studies , and demonstrated the ability to promote healing and osseointegration compared with control scaf - folds [ 136 – 138 ] . Researchers combine multiple polymers in a chemical process called copolymerization to gain more control over the degradation rate , hydrophobicity , crystal - linity . Copolymerization is analogous to the design of composite materials where multiple constituents are com - bined resulting in a new material with desirable properties from each constituent . Undoubtedly , the most commonly utilized copolymer for bioactive molecule encapsulation and release for bone tissue engineering is the copolymer poly ( lactic acid - co - glycolic acid ) ( PLGA ) . Several researchers have utilized this well - characterized copolymer for encapsulation and release of a wide variety of bioactive molecules and drugs including TGF - b , BMPs , IGFs , VEGF , NGF , DNA , vancomycin , gentamycin , cisplatin , and others [ 139 – 146 ] . However , although PLGA has shown to be promisinge in bone scaffold applications , its clinical utility is limited due to its relatively poor mechanical properties ( speciﬁcally Young’s Modulus ) compared with cancellous bone , and therefore must be combined with other materials to enhance its mechanical properties [ 147 ] . Many synthetic bone scaffolds rely on the delivery of single factors , which may partially explain the limited clinical utility of many current approaches [ 140 ] . There - fore , researchers have been investigating techniques to encapsulate and release multiple bioactive molecules in a highly controlled spatial and temporal manner . Research has shown that this method signiﬁcantly enhances tissue regeneration compared with the controlled release of single biological cues [ 148 – 150 ] . The technology of incorporat - ing multiple chemical effectors and controlling their spatial and temporal release is a very promising strategy , but is still experimental and has not yet demonstrated widespread preclinical or clinical utility to date . The failure to identify either a single material or growth factor as the panacea for bone regeneration , or a biological scaffold that will promote integration and vascularization , has led to an increased interest in optimizing biomaterials to promote speciﬁc cell - biomaterial interactions . For example , Arg – Gly – Asp ( RGD ) sequence peptides ( involved in integrin - mediated cell adhesion ) can be incorporated onto the scaffold surface to enhance cell adhesion and spreading [ 151 ] . Yang et al . [ 152 ] have demonstrated the potential to promote human osteopro - genitor differentiation on RGD - coupled biodegradeable scaffolds . More recently drug delivery techniques such as entrap - ment within a hydrogel matrix allowing growth factors to be released in a controlled fashion from the scaffold to aid the regenerating tissue have been applied [ 153 – 156 ] . Such approaches are appealing as they avoid the use of solvents , and high temperatures ( and therefore protein degradation ) and subsequent release of the growth factor is controlled , in response to environmental stimuli . This strategy has been J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 2455 123 employed in bone tissue engineering , where rhBMP - 2 [ 157 ] basic ﬁbroblast growth factor [ 155 ] and vascular endothelial growth factor [ 156 ] have all been successfully incorporated into a hydrogel prior to in vivo implantation . Supercritical ﬂuid technology has evolved as a promising approach in the development of porous biodegradable scaffolds for tissue engineering [ 158 ] . The absence of solvents and thermal processing makes this an attractive approach to growth factor incorporation and Howdle and colleagues have demonstrated high protein ( ribonuclease ) loading into foamed PLA scaffolds which retained full activity on subsequent release from the PLA over 3 months [ 153 , 159 ] . This technology could provide a simple one - step process to the difﬁculties of incorporating growth factors and / or guest particles ( such as hydroxyapatite ) into a controlled release delivery system . New strategies works to encapsulate and release drugs which prevent pathologies that can occur post implantation of a synthetic scaffold . A wide variety of drugs have been encapsulated and released from biodegradable polymer scaffolds including antibiotics , DNA , RNA , cathepsin inhibitors , chitin , chemotherapeutics , bisphosphonates , statins , sodium ﬂuoride , dihydropyridine , and many others [ 160 – 164 ] . Researchers are aggressively pursuing strate - gies to deliver antibiotics locally to the site of injury / sur - gery . The most common biodegradable polymer / antibiotic combination is PLGA scaffolds loaded with antibiotics such as ciproﬂoxin , gentamycin , and vancomycin [ 165 , 166 ] . PLGA scaffolds have demonstrated successful sus - tained local delivery of these antibiotics for up to 20 or more days in vitro and in preclinical animal models [ 141 , 142 , 167 – 169 ] . Although local delivery of antibiotics has a very promising outlook , there remains a number of chal - lenges ( such as antibiotic stability within the scaffold and antibiotic deactivation during fabrication ) , which need to be addressed before clinical trials can begin [ 170 ] . 10 . 2 Cell - based and gene therapy The challenges offered by current bone grafting techniques have been driving the intensive research efforts spent during the last decades to develop new approaches and technologies . To this aim , cell - based gene therapy has attracted great interest from the scientiﬁc community , representing a tentative approach to achieve bone substi - tution [ 171 ] . In gene therapy approaches , cells are used as bioactive vehicles delivering osteoinductive genes locally to achieve bone regeneration . Different molecules have been tested to this aim , mainly represented by genes belonging to the BMP family and related cascade [ 172 ] . Indeed , genetically engineered cells are believed to main - tain physiologic doses of a gene product for a sustained period once inoculated into the selected anatomical site , facilitating an efﬁcient bone healing [ 173 ] . In addition , the overwhelming amount of data that have been clarifying the whole molecular scenario orchestrating osteogenesis and bone healing , provided new osteoinductive molecules to be tested as potential therapeutics [ 174 ] . Cell - based gene therapy approaches based on engineered - osteoinductive cells allowed achieving the most convincing results in terms of bone healing in animal models [ 172 , 174 , 175 ] . Though , a number of safety issues currently limit the use of genetic engineering procedures , based on viral and nonviral vectors , in the clinical setting . Thus , strictly - named gene therapy approaches for bone regeneration ceased to repre - sent suitable for translational purposes . Cell - based approaches are mainly based on mesenchy - mal stem cells ( MSCs ) , that have been widely employed , in conjunction with appropriate osteoinductive scaffolds , and considered the most effective bioactive bone substitutes ‘‘in vivo’’ [ 172 , 176 , 177 ] . MSCs are multipotent stem cells that are capable of extensive self - renewal , plasticity and multilineage potential [ 178 , 179 ] . These cells resides in the stroma of bone marrow and other organs and tissues ( fat , muscle , skin , synovial membrane , tendons lung , etc . ) ; hence they are also named ‘‘stromal stem cells’’ [ 180 ] . The great advantages of MSCs reside in the ease of isolation and ‘‘ex vivo ’’ expansion , preserving their plasticity and self - renewal potential [ 181 ] . Upon appropriate in vitro induction , MSCs can be differentiated along the osteogenic lineage . MSC derived from bone marrow showed a high potential for osteogenic differentiation , which has been exploited for cell - based therapy of congenital bone disorders [ 182 – 184 ] . The proposed use of MSCs in orthopedic surgery comes also from their immunomodulatory properties , that make them potentially suitable for allogenic transplantation [ 185 ] . It is noteworthy that naı¨ve undifferentiated MSCs are prone to environment - induced lineage commitment [ 186 ] meaning that they can undergo spontaneous osteogenic differentiation upon ‘‘in vivo ’’ inoculation into a damaged bone [ 187 , 176 ] . This feature may suggest their safe use as it does not imply any kind of ‘‘ex vivo ’’ osteogenic induction prior to ‘‘in vivo ’’ inoculation . Nonetheless , the production of clinical - grade MSCs , requires dedicated cell factories for their ‘‘ex vivo ’’ large scale culture ampliﬁca - tion ; these are GMP - proof facilities that need to comply to the same regulations required for the drug manufacturing industries , as culture - ampliﬁed cells , according to Euro - pean tissue banking rules , are considered as medicinal products [ 21 , 188 ] . Few active clinical trials are currently ongoing that exploit MSC - based treatment as bone regenerative strate - gies ( www . clinicaltrials . gov ) [ 189 ] . 2456 J Mater Sci : Mater Med ( 2014 ) 25 : 2445 – 2461 123 11 Conclusions Bone loss persists to be an important challenge in surgery , and many alternatives are available . Despite the improve - ment of research , human bone grafts persist to be the most effective bone substitutes to replace bone loss . Alternatives to bone grafts lacks of one or more of the concepts of the ‘‘Diamond theory’’ of Giannoudis : osteogenic cells and vascularization , mechanical stability , growth factors , os - teoconductive scaffolds ( in combination with growths factors ) , that are a prerequisite for bone healing [ 190 ] . Moreover most alternatives are expensive and not validated by EBM , thus being scarcely recommendable for clinical use . Actually , ceramics substitutes are the best for safeness , effectiveness and costs . BMP 2 and BMP 7 are EBM validated , for speciﬁc use , but costs are elevated . Other techniques or alternatives are expensive , and not validated , thus needing standard randomized clinical trials prior to be approved for routinely clinical use .
