Online Supplementary Material The matrix corroded : podosomes and invadopodia in extracellular matrix degradation Stefan Linder Institut für Prophylaxe und Epidemiologie der Kreislaufkrankheiten , Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität , Pettenkoferstr . 9 , 80336 München , Germany Corresponding author : Linder , S . ( stefan . linder @ med . uni - muenchen . de ) . Podosomes and invadopodia are unique actin - rich adhesions that establish close contact to the substratum but can also degrade components of the extracellular matrix . Accordingly , matrix degradation localized at the podosomes or invadopodia is thought to contribute to cellular invasiveness in physiological and pathological situations . Cell types that form podosomes include monocytic , endothelial and smooth muscle cells , whereas invadopodia have been mostly observed in carcinoma cells . Here , I highlight important new developments in the field , discuss the common and divergent features of podosomes and invadopodia and summarize current knowledge about matrix - degrading proteinases at these structures . Figure S1 . Statistics on publications addressing podosomes or invadopodia . The x - axis shows the year of publication ( for recent papers this is the year of electronic publication ; the right - hand bar indicates publications in 2006 until end of October ) ; the y - axis gives the number of publications per year .
