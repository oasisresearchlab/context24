Most of these studies that targeted complexes with intact microtubules have been carried out by helical 3 - D reconstruction , while few were analyzed by single particle approaches or from 2 - D crystalline arrays . Helical reconstruction of microtubule – MAP or motor complexes has been extremely successful but by deﬁnition , all helical 3 - D reconstruction attempts require perfectly helical assemblies , which presents a serious limitation and conﬁnes the attempts to 15 - or 16 - protoﬁlament microtubules , microtubule conﬁgurations that are very rare in nature . The rise of cryo - electron tomogra - phy within the last few years has now opened a new avenue towards solving 3 - D structures of microtu - bule – MAP complexes that do not form helical assemblies , most importantly for the subject here , all microtubules that exhibit a lattice seam . In addition , not all motor domains or MAPs decorate the micro - tubule surface regularly enough to match the underlying microtubule lattice , or they adopt conforma - tions that deviate from helical symmetry . Here we demonstrate the power and limitation of cryo - electron tomography using two kinesin motor domains , the monomeric Eg5 motor domain , and the hete - rodimeric Kar3Vik1 motor . We show here that tomography does not exclude the possibility of post - tomo - graphic averaging when identical sub - volumes can be extracted from tomograms and in both cases we were able to reconstruct 3 - D maps of conformations that are not possible to obtain using helical or other averaging - based methods .

Introduction Until now , most cryo - electron microscopy 3 - D data on microtu - bules and microtubule – kinesin complexes have been produced by so - called averaging - based methods , mainly helical averaging ( DeR - osier and Moore , 1970 ; for tubulin examples , see Sosa et al . , 1997 ; Beuron and Hoenger , 2001 ; Wendt et al . , 2002 ; Skiniotis et al . , 2003 ; Kikkawa et al . , 2000 ; Hirose et al . , 2006 ; Sindelar and Down - ing , 2007 ) , but also by single particle approaches ( Li et al . , 2002 ) and 2 - D crystallography ( e . g . to solve the structure of the a b - tubu - lin dimer itself : Nogales et al . , 1998 ) . Common to all these cases , 2 - D projections of identical particles at various angles are collected , averaged and back - projected into 3 - D space . Though this could be done in real space , it is often carried out in Fourier space where phases and amplitudes can be assessed separately . The most important prerequisites for averaging - based 3 - D reconstructions are ( A ) the averaged particle must be identical in shape and confor - mation , and ( B ) their projection angles relative to each other ( so - called Euler angles ) must be determined accurately . If this is achievable , averaging - based methods are very powerful for eluci - dating molecular structures and may yield close to atomic detail ( tubulin : Nogales et al . , 1998 ) . In most biological applications , however , many structures , even small macromolecular assemblies are often too ﬂexible and dynamic for averaging procedures . For these cases , the cur - rently most promising alternative to averaging - based 3 - D recon - struction methods is cryo - electron tomography . Initially , tomographic 3 - D reconstruction does not rely on averaging and therefore can be applied to any specimen that can be imaged in an electron microscope , no matter how complex its structure may be ( reviewed in Lucic et al . , 2005 ; Hoenger and McIntosh , 2009 ) . However , once a tomogram is completed , sub - volumes containing identical particles may be extracted and further pro - cessed by averaging ( Walz et al . , 1997 ; Taylor et al . , 2007 ; För - ster and Hegerl , 2007 ; Bartesaghi et al . , 2008 ) . To this end , we have developed our own software called PEET ( Particle Estima - tion for Electron Tomography : Mastronarde et al . , in preparation , for example , see Nicastro et al . , 2006 ) . Here , we illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of both helical reconstruction and volume averaging methods for microtubule – kinesin motor domain complexes . 1047 - 8477 / $ - see front matter (cid:2) 2009 Elsevier Inc .

Journal of Structural Biology 170 ( 2010 ) 257 – 265 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Structural Biology journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / yjsbi The kinesin superfamily comprises a large and diverse group of molecular motors that interact with microtubules to perform a wide variety of essential functions in the cell including roles in intracellular transport and cell division ( reviewed in Hirokawa et al . , 2009 ) . Mitotic kinesins are a group of kinesins that are re - quired for cell division , playing a crucial role in assembly , mainte - nance and function of the mitotic spindle ( reviewed in Wittmann et al . , 2001 ) . As such , they now constitute a new focus for studies on anti - cancer drugs and therapies targeted speciﬁcally to kinesin motor function , either directly towards the motor domains ( e . g . Monastrol : Maliga et al . , 2002 , 2006 ; Cochran et al . , 2004 , 2005 ; Crevel et al . , 2004 ; Yan et al . , 2004 ; Krzysiak et al . , 2006 ) , or to other functional parts such as cargo domains and receptors . This report focuses on the motor domains of two structurally very dif - ferent kinesins with important roles in mitosis : the plus - end direc - ted kinesin - 5 Eg5 ( Kashina et al . , 1996 ; X - ray structure : Turner et al . , 2001 ) as a monomeric motor domain , and the minus - end di - rected kinesin - 14 Kar3 ( Meluh and Rose , 1990 ) as a functional het - erodimer with Vik1 ( Manning et al . , 1999 ; Barrett et al . , 2000 ) . Eg5 is a highly conserved homotetrameric kinesin with an essential role in formation of the bipolar microtubule spindle and separation of the chromosomes during mitosis ( Blangy et al . , 1995 ) . Due to its bipolar structure , it is currently believed that Eg5 motors translocate to the plus - ends of microtubules at the on - set of mitosis and begin to organize microtubules by cross - linking leading to the formation of the stable bipolar spindle seen in meta - phase ( Kapitein et al . , 2005 ) . Once the spindle is in place , Eg5 pro - vides structural support and contributes to poleward ﬂux by sliding the microtubules apart towards the centrosomes ( Valentine et al . , 2006 ) . Structural studies are of interest to elucidate the mechanical properties of this homotetrameric kinesin and its mode of action in spindle maintenance . Kar3Vik1 is an unusual heterodimeric kinesin found in Saccha - romyces cerevisiae . Both components of the heterodimer have been individually crystallized and solved to about 2 . 5 Å resolution ( Kar3 : Gulick et al . , 1998 ; Vik1 : Allingham et al . , 2007 ) . Kar3Vik1 is unusual because it has only one motor domain , Kar3 , whose localization and activity is regulated through its association with a non - motor protein , Vik1 ( Manning et al . , 1999 ) . Kar3Vik1 is ac - tive during vegetative growth where it localizes predominantly at the spindle poles and is thought to cross - link microtubules , con - tributing to mitotic spindle assembly and stabilization ( Manning and Snyder , 2000 ; Gardner et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , the recently solved crystal structure of the C - terminal globular domain of Vik1 revealed that it has a fold remarkably similar to a kinesin motor domain , but does not have an active site for ATP hydrolysis ( Alling - ham et al . , 2007 ) . Despite being unable to hydrolyze ATP , Vik1 binds tightly to microtubules in vitro supporting a model where both Kar3 and Vik1 interact with the microtubule during its walk - ing cycle . Structural studies on Kar3Vik1 thus aim to identify a no - vel kinesin – microtubule interaction and may also provide insight into the mechanisms of movement of other heterodimeric kinesins that have thus far been difﬁcult to study ( Scholey et al . , 1996 ; De Marco et al . , 2001 ; Woehlke and Schliwa , 2007 ) . Tomography is not a new method for electron microscopy , but recent technical advances on hardware and software have since strongly boosted its popularity ( Frank , 2006 ) . In particular , tomog - raphy on vitriﬁed specimens is now realistic due to sensitive detec - tors and automated low - dose recording software . Here , we focus exclusively on cryo - electron tomography since only frozen - hy - drated specimens have the structural preservation required for molecular analysis . By using cryo - electron tomography we could resolve molecular details in kinesin – microtubule complexes that would be impossible to image in 3 - D by helical averaging . How - ever , even by volume averaging approaches the interpretable molecular details of cryo - tomography compare to the lower - reso - lution end of helically averaged maps . Hence , both methods are very complementary . Helical averaging wins the resolution race but sometimes loses important details due to averaging and sym - metry enforcement . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Expression and puriﬁcation of Eg5 and Kar3Vik1 2 . 1 . 1 . Eg5 monomer The monomeric motor domain of Eg5 was expressed and puri - ﬁed as described by Cochran et al . ( 2004 ) . 2 . 1 . 2 . Kar3Vik1 heterodimer Heterodimers of Kar3Vik1 were expressed and puriﬁed as de - scribed by Allingham et al . ( 2006 ) . 2 . 2 . Microtubule polymerization Microtubules were polymerized in vitro from 45 l M bovine tubulin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . , Denver , CO ) with BRB80 ( 80 mM PIPES , pH 6 . 8 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA ) in the presence of 1 mM GTP , 10 l M paclitaxel and 8 % ( v / v ) DMSO for 30 min at 37 (cid:3) C , and al - lowed to stabilize overnight at room temperature . 2 . 3 . Sample preparation for cryo - electron microscopy Eg5 – microtubule complexes were formed in solution in the pres - ence of 2 mM AMP – PNP ( Sigma – Aldrich Corp . , St Louis , MO ) , at a ﬁnal tubulin concentration of 4 . 5 l M and a ﬁnal Eg5 concentration of 18 l m ( see also Krzysiak et al . , 2006 ) . Complexes were adsorbed to holey - carbon C - ﬂat grids ( Protochips , Inc . , Raleigh , NC ) for 45 s and subsequently plunge - frozen into liquid ethane using a home - made plunge - freezing device . Kar3Vik1 – microtubule complexes were formed directly on holey - carbon C - ﬂat grids to prevent bundling of the microtubules . Micro - tubules at a concentration of 4 . 5 l M were adsorbed onto grids for 45 s and excess liquid was blotted away . Kar3Vik1 at concentra - tions ranging from 3 . 5 l M to 4 . 5 l M was incubated with the microtubules for 2 min in the presence of 2 mM AMP – PNP and plunge - frozen as described above . Colloidal gold ( 10 nm ) was added to all samples before plunging for use as ﬁducial markers . 2 . 4 . Electron microscopy data collection Samples were transferred under liquid nitrogen to a Gatan - 626 cryo - holder ( Gatan , Inc . , Pleasanton , CA ) . Cryo - electron microscopy data was collected on an FEI Tecnai F20 FEG transmission electron microscope ( FEI Company , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) operating at 200 kV . Images and tilt series were collected at a nominal mag - niﬁcation of 29 000 (cid:2) and a defocus of (cid:3) 2 . 5 l m ( Kar3Vik1 – micro - tubules complexes ) or (cid:3) 6 l m ( Eg5 – microtubule complexes ) . Single frame images ( Fig . 2A ) were taken with an electron dose of 15 electrons / Å 2 . Tilt series consisting of about 80 low - dose images , were collected by tilting the specimen between (cid:3) 60 (cid:3) and + 60 (cid:3) ( Figs . 1A , 3A , and 4A ) , or (cid:3) 70 (cid:3) and + 70 (cid:3) ( Fig . 5A ) , imaging at 1 . 5 (cid:3) increments . Images at higher tilts were recorded with a higher dose to compensate for the increase in sample thickness . SerialEM software ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) was used to automate the data acquisition and minimize exposure of the specimen to the electron beam . The total dose for each tilt series was about 100 electrons / Å 2 . Images were recorded binned by two on a 4K (cid:2) 4K Gatan Ultrascan 895 CCD camera ( Gatan , Inc . ) . With this camera , at a nominal microscope magniﬁcation of 29 000 (cid:2) the resulting pixel size corresponds to 7 . 6 Å on the specimen . 258 J . Cope et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 170 ( 2010 ) 257 – 265 2 . 5 . Tomogram reconstruction and sub - tomogram averaging Tomograms were reconstructed from tilt series data by weighted back - projection using the IMOD software package ( Kre - mer et al . , 1996 ) . Colloidal gold beads ( 10 nm ) were tracked as ﬁducial markers to align the stack of tilted images . To select sub - tomograms for averaging motor - decorated micro - tubules ( Figs . 1 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) , the center of the microtubule and the trajectory along one of its protoﬁlaments were modeled by hand every 15 – 30 nm . A program was run to ﬁll in model points every 8 nm along the microtubule axis ( representing the length of an a b - tubulin dimer repeat ) , and to determine the twist of the micro - tubule to produce a set of initial orientations for an alignment search in the ﬁrst round of averaging . The PEET software package was used to align and average repeating sub - volumes . To average the Kar3Vik1 heterodimers in between two microtu - bules ( Fig . 4 ) , sub - volumes each containing one Kar3Vik1 ‘bridge’ were modeled by hand and input into PEET for alignment and averaging . Isosurface rendering of the sub - volume averages was carried out using IMOD ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) or UCSF Chimera ( Figs . 1 , 3 , and 4 ) ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . A low pass ﬁlter was applied to all aver - ages to reduce noise before rendering . 3 . Results and discussion 3 . 1 . Cryo - electron tomography versus helical 3 - D reconstruction on kinesin – microtubule complexes The ﬁrst structural analyses of microtubules date back to Amos and Klug ( 1974 ) who also produced the ﬁrst 3 - D reconstruction of tubulin protoﬁlaments and model of a microtubule ( Amos and Ba - ker , 1979 ) from zinc - induced 2 - D crystalline tubulin sheets . How - ever , 3 - D cryo - EM on microtubules picked up only after the developments of cryo - EM methods ( Dubochet et al . , 1988 ) and the discovery that microtubules composed of 15 - protoﬁlaments may form helical polymers ( Fig . 1E – I ; Wade and Chrétien , 1993 ; Fig . 1 . Comparison between cryo - electron tomography and helical 3 - D reconstruction of frozen - hydrated microtubules decorated with monomeric kinesin ( Eg5 ) motor domains . ( A ) A 4 . 5 nm slice from a tomogram of microtubules decorated with monomeric Eg5 motors . Microtubules which are slightly tilted to the image plane expose a sequence of their top , lumen , and bottom regions as they cut through the slice . The B - lattice pattern emphasized by the motor decoration shows a different angle along the Bessel (cid:3) 2 helix according to the sketch . Since this is a left - handed helix , red lines show the angular orientation of the helical path according to the top view ( towards the observer ) , while the green lines indicate the course of the helix at the bottom of the microtubule . Occasionally a lattice seam , typical for non - helical microtubules with B - lattices , can be seendirectly . The inset magniﬁes the framed area and reveals a bottom view of the seam , here madevisible by the motor decoration . The seam isvisible due to the shift of one protoﬁlament by 4 nm in the axial direction relative to the other ( interruptions in green lines ) . ( B ) Cross - section through a 9 nm projection of a volume average obtained by PEET combining 218 particles along one microtubule . This microtubule is composed of 14 - protoﬁlaments , which can be clearly seen despite the obvious loss of resolution along the z - axis ( here top to bottom ) due to anisotropy caused by the missing wedge of data . ( C ) The surface rendering of the average clearly shows the helical path of the microtubule as well as the lattice seam typical for a 14 - protoﬁlament microtubule . ( D – F ) Helical averaging of microtubules is only possible if they are truly helical . This is the case for a 15 - protoﬁlament microtubule ( red frame in ( F ) ) but not for the more common 13 - protoﬁlament microtubules ( yellow frame in ( F ) ) . Fourier ﬁltering ( D and E ) of the microtubules marked by frames reveals strikingly different 2 - D projection patterns . 13 - Protoﬁlament microtubules ( D ) are perfectly aligned with the tubular axis while 15 - ( E – I ) , or 16 - protoﬁlament microtubules ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) reveals a super - twisted arrangement . The supertwist is visible in the 3 - D reconstruction in ( F ) as a deviation of the protoﬁlaments ( dotted green line ) from the microtubule axis ( solid green line ) . Kinesin motor decoration reveals a Fourier ﬁltered image as shown in ( G ) . The helical diffraction pattern ( H ) shows the helical layerline pattern where the layerlines around Bessel (cid:3) 2 ( axial motor – tubulin dimer repeat ) and (cid:3) 4 ( axial a – b – a – b - tubulin repeat ) form a cluster of 3 – 4 strong layerlines due to the convolution of the (cid:3) 2 and (cid:3) 4 helices with the protoﬁlament supertwist . ( I ) The 3 - D reconstruction reveals the added kinesin heads as yellow densities , marking each a b - tubulin dimer . J . Cope et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 170 ( 2010 ) 257 – 265 259 Arnal et al . , 1996 ; Beuron and Hoenger , 2001 ) while most others carry a so - called lattice seam ( Fig . 1A and C ; Mandelkow et al . , 1986 ; Kikkawa et al . , 1994 ; Sandblad et al . , 2006 ) that interrupts helical symmetry . The second boost came from the X - ray crystal structures of monomeric and dimeric ncd ( Sablin et al . , 1996 , 1998 ) as well as monomeric ( Kull et al . , 1996 ) and dimeric kine - sin - 1 ( Kozielski et al . , 1997 ) . With these data at hand , molecular docking became popular for kinesin – microtubule structures ( Sosa Fig . 2 . Cryo - electron microscopy of microtubules decorated with Kar3Vik1 heterodimers . ( A ) Frozen - hydrated microtubules decorated with a dimeric Kar3Vik1 construct reveals obvious cooperative microtubule - binding properties . The cooperative binding creates a heterogeneous decoration pattern where some microtubules show full decoration on one side while the opposing side is free of motor decoration ( red frame ) . ( Insets in A ) Crystal structures of the Vik1 motor - homology domain ( left ) , and the Kar3 motor domain ( right ) are shown for comparison . Some structural similarities such as the central b - sheet surrounded by three a helices on each side are obvious . However , despite the similarity , Vik1 lacks a nucleotide - binding site . ( B ) Magniﬁed and contrast - enhanced region of the frame in ( A ) . The picture contrast has been inverted and boosted by an ‘‘embossing” ﬁlter to emphasize the visibility of the tubulin – Kar3Vik1 dimer complexes . Since the motors have been ﬂushed with AMP – PNP , we believe that the domain in contact with the microtubule surface is the Kar3 - MD while the tethered domain is Vik1 - MHD . However , this remains to be determined experimentally . Fig . 3 . Dissection of microtubules partially decorated with Kar3Vik1 by cryo - electron tomography . ( A ) A 9 nm slice through a tomogram of microtubules decorated with Kar3Vik1 heterodimers reveals features similar to those discussed in Fig . 1 . Kar3Vik1 decorates microtubules in a cooperative fashion leaving empty patches besides fully decorated areas . ( B ) Three individual 4 . 5 nm sections through the top , center , and bottom of the tomogram of the microtubule boxed in ( A ) . The inset in the center panel shows an end - on view of the microtubule . While the bottom region shows strong striations every 8 nm corresponding to a fully motor - decorated surface ( green lines ) the top region reveals empty microtubule protoﬁlaments running axially . A striking advantage of tomographic 3 - D reconstruction is observed in the center panel in that small single events such as individual missing motors ( red circles ) are revealed with much better clarity than in 2 - D projections . These events would be lost after helical averaging due to the symmetry constraints . ( C ) An isosurface representation from a PEET average of 146 particles selected from the microtubule in ( B ) gives a clear view of how the top of the microtubule is free of motor decoration while the bottom and sides of the microtubule are completely decorated by KarVik1 . 260 J . Cope et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 170 ( 2010 ) 257 – 265 Fig . 4 . Cryo - electron tomography of Kar3Vik1 dimers connecting between adjacent microtubules . ( A ) Eighteen nanometers x – z ( top ) and x – y ( bottom ) slices through a tomogram showing the cross - section through two adjacent microtubules ( top ) and the Kar3Vik1 motors extending toward each other between the two microtubules ( bottom ) . ( B ) An18 nm projection and surface rendering of an average obtained by PEET from 44 sub - volumes selected from the tomogram in ( A ) . The bridging motors appear to bend towards each other in a manner different from the regular radially extending conformations shown in Figs . 3 and 5 . Since this is a highly artiﬁcial in vitro situation , the biological signiﬁcance of these bridging motors is not clear . Rather , this exempliﬁes the way we are able to use cryo - electron tomography and subsequent volume averaging to analyze structural details that would not be possible by other averaging methods . Fig . 5 . Cryo - electron tomography and subsequent volume averaging of fully decorated Kar3Vik1 – microtubule complexes . ( A ) Three nanometers thick tomographic x – y slice of amicrotubule decoratedwithKar3Vik1 overlaidwiththeaveraged volumeshown in ( B ) – ( E ) andFig . 6A andB . ( B – D ) Four nanometers x – y slices throughthe topand center of an average of 99 particles selected from the tomogram in ( A ) according to the planes indicated in ( E ) . The center slice in ( D ) cuts along the missing wedge , noticeable as reduced resolution compared to the x – y slice above . The central x – y slice ( C ) through the microtubule clearly shows densities corresponding to the a - and b - subunits of tubulin and to the two globular domains of Kar3 and Vik1 extending out from the microtubule . ( E and F ) End - on view ( x – z ) of the 3 - D map before ( E ) and after rotational averaging over all protoﬁlaments ( F ) . The rotationally averaged map now looks indistinguishable from a helical reconstruction map at the same resolution . While the missing wedge effect is clearly visible before rotational averaging as the strong densities and smearing out along the z - axis , rotational averaging eliminates the missing wedge completely . J . Cope et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 170 ( 2010 ) 257 – 265 261 et al . , 1997 ) and many other macromolecular assemblies after automated procedures became available ( Volkmann and Hanein , 1999 ; Wriggers et al . , 1999 ) . Today the best resolved 3 - D data on kinesin – microtubule complexes were obtained by helical averag - ing and show 8 – 9 Å detail ( Hirose et al . , 2006 ; Sindelar and Down - ing , 2007 ; Bodey et al . , 2009 ) . The major advantages of helical reconstruction of microtubule – MAP complexes can be summarized as follows : ( A ) Helical averaging produces low - noise data with isotropic resolution , sometimes to near - atomic detail . The averaging power is very high as a large number of unit cells ( 50 , 000 and more ) can be included rapidly , yielding an excellent sig - nal to noise ratio . Diffraction ( Fig . 1G ) and Fourier ﬁltering ( Fig . 1D , E , and G ) allow rapid assessments of the data quality . ( B ) Raw - data are obtained from single , untilted projections which strongly facilitates corrections for the contrast trans - fer function ( CTF ) and allows the application of a high elec - tron dose ( (cid:4) 40 – 100 electrons / Å 2 ; Fig . 1F ) at each image since each individual specimen is only recorded once . The major constraints of helical averaging are : ( A ) By deﬁnition , helical 3 - D reconstruction requires a perfectly helical assembly ( Fig . 1E – I ) that is often either highly artiﬁ - cial ( e . g . in the case of kinesin – microtubule complexes the motor to tubulin ratio is much higher than under in vivo conditions ( Fig . 1I ) ) , does not reproduce native conforma - tions , or is simply impossible to obtain ( structures too ﬂex - ible and dynamic ) . ( B ) Single molecular events such as lattice seams ( Fig . 1A and C ) or missing individual particles ( Fig . 3B ) cannot be observed in 3 - D . If these events occur , they will be lost by being aver - aged over all other events during the 3 - D reconstruction process , potentially interfering with the accuracy of the resulting 3 - D maps . The emerging alternative method to study macromolecular assemblies without the constraints associated with helical recon - struction is cryo - electron tomography ( Figs . 1A , 3A , B , 4A , and 5A ) . As illustrated in Fig . 1A , kinesin – microtubule complexes can be reconstructed in 3 - D independent of the polymer composition and can be analyzed for structural detail ( such as the lattice seam or handedness of the helical path at distinct locations ) that would not be observable by a helical averaging approach . By focusing on thin slices through the tomogram , single motor domains , and their empty spots when missing can be observed ( Fig . 3B ) . Such single events would be difﬁcult to detect on regular cryo - micrographs that superimpose all the densities along the projection . 3 - D data from cooperative decoration events ( Figs . 2A and 3B ) or bridging motor domains between two adjacent microtubules ( Fig . 4 ) cannot be obtained by helical averaging since they do not follow any heli - cal symmetry . However , although no averaging is done with the raw - data and / or in the tomographic 3 - D reconstruction procedure , averaging may still be applied as a post - tomographic procedure , further enhancing the signal to noise ratio for particles which can be iden - tiﬁed within a tomogram at various orientations , but which are otherwise structurally reproducible enough to be averaged as en - tire volumes ( Walz et al . , 1997 ; Taylor et al . , 2007 ; Förster and He - gerl , 2007 ; Bartesaghi et al . , 2008 ) . This is much more computationally demanding and only 10 – 15 years ago would not have been realistic without the Linux clusters or multi - core com - puters that we use today . We are developing a dedicated software suite for averaging volumes selected from tomograms called PEET ( Particle Estimation for Electron Tomography : Mastronarde et al . , in preparation , for example , see Nicastro et al . , 2006 ) . With this Fig . 6 . Rotational averaging around the tubular axis effectively eliminates the missing wedge . ( A and B ) Surface renderings of the averaged 3 - D map are shown in Fig . 5A – E . Thecross - section reveals the numberof protoﬁlaments of thismicrotubule to be 16 , which produces aperfectly helical microtubule ( Bessel order (cid:3) 2 ) withoutseams ( see ( B ) ) . ( D and E ) Surface rendered 3 - Dmap afterrotational averaging of the mapin ( A ) ( see also Fig . 5F ) . Themissing wedge effectiseliminated . Byrotationally averaging over all16 - protoﬁlaments the asymmetric unit changes from axialslices along the microtubule axis to one a b - tubulin – motor domain complex . Hence , the theoretical maximumnumber of asymmetric units included in the average is increased from 99 to 1584 ( 16 (cid:2) 99 ) . However , our average is based on the 1242 particles with the best correlation to the reference because this subset gave the highest resolution . ( C and F ) For Fourier - shell correlation calculations , the datasets were split in half on a random basis and the two halves were correlated against each other . Fourier - shell correlation graphs obtained from the maps in A ( C ) and D ( F ) reveal resolution limits of 3 . 8 nm and 3 . 2 nm , respectively , based on the 50 % correlation criterion . For FSC calculations a dataset is split in half on a random basis and correlated against each other . Accordingly the number of asymmetric units in each group is maximally 49 before rotational averaging , and 621 afterwards . 262 J . Cope et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 170 ( 2010 ) 257 – 265 software we produced the averages presented in Figs . 1B , C , 3C , 4B , and 5A – F . Each average requires between 10 and 20 CPU hours split up over 35 processors on our Linux cluster . Typically the num - ber of particles that go into an average is much smaller than for a helical approach . This reduces the averaging power , but 3 - D parti - cles contain more structural information than 2 - D projections , which facilitates accurate alignments . The major advantages of tomographic reconstruction of micro - tubule – MAP complexes can be summarized as follows : ( A ) Cryo - tomographic 3 - D reconstruction is applicable to any random structure and requires neither symmetry nor any structurally reproducible sub - particles ( unless post - tomo - graphic averaging should be applied ) . Cryo - tomography works well on plunge - frozen isolated macromolecular assemblies ( as presented here ) as well as on vitriﬁed sec - tions ( Norlén et al . , 2009 ) . ( B ) Extraction of thin slices from tomograms reveals relatively noise - free data that omits the convolution of projected data with lower and upper structures ( see Figs . 3B and 5B , C ; the result is somewhat similar to a confocal recording in light microscopy ) . ( C ) Single molecular events may be observed and analyzed ( e . g . missing particles in an otherwise regular array ; Fig . 3B ) . ( D ) Post - tomographic data processing such as sub - volume aver - aging is facilitated by starting off with 3 - D data rather than 2 - D projections and if successful , yields high signal to noise 3 - D data ( see Figs . 1B , C , 3C , 4B , and 5B – F ) . The major constraints of tomographic 3 - D reconstruction are : ( A ) Cryo - tomograms are composed of tilt series ( typically 80 – 100 projections ) recorded on the very same object . The res - olution in tomograms depends on the accuracy of alignment and back - projection of each projection . Deviations from the assumed tilt angles , focus variations , and technical limita - tions such as bending support ﬁlms reduce the resolution in the ﬁnal tomograms . ( B ) The design of electron microscope stages and grid holder geometries limit the recording range of tilt series to approx - imately (cid:3) 70 (cid:3) and + 70 (cid:3) ( rather than a full 180 (cid:3) rotation ) , leaving a missing wedge of data that results in anisotropic resolution ( see Figs . 1B , 3C , 4B , 5E , and 6A and B ) that is usu - ally lower than what is achieved with a helical approach . ( C ) Cryo - tomograms have to be collected under strict low - dose conditions and therefore individual projections are extre - mely noisy , which may interfere with the alignment and back - projection process . ( D ) While not impossible , CTF correction on tilt series is demanding due to the various focus values in images from tilted specimens ( see Xiong et al . , 2009 ) . 3 . 2 . Cryo - EM on Kar3Vik1 – microtubule complexes reveals a highly cooperative binding pattern and a one - head - down and one - head - up dimer - binding conﬁguration Kar3Vik1 is an unusual kinesin in the sense that it comprises a typical kinesin - 14 motor domain ( Kar3 - MD ) heterodimerized with a non - motor protein , the Vik1 motor - homology domain ( Vik1 - MHD ) by a coiled - coil interaction . Conventional cryo - electron microscopy reveals a Kar3Vik1 binding property that is dominated by a cooperative process ( Fig . 2A ) . This can be seen directly as un - even decoration along microtubules where one side of some micro - tubules is completely free of motor decoration while the other side appears fully decorated . Fig . 3 shows a cryo - tomographic 3 - D reconstruction of a partially decorated microtubule . Slices through the microtubule framed in Fig . 3A reveal the top portion to be void of motors , while the bottom portion shows full decoration . The center part reveals some missing individual motors along other - wise fully decorated protoﬁlaments ( circles in Fig . 3B ) . Due to the partial decoration in the framed area in Fig . 2A and the optimal side - view of the motors , the overall shape of the di - meric Kar3Vik1 construct is clearly visualized . Fig . 2B shows a con - trast - enhanced magniﬁcation of the framed region in Fig . 2A . Here , the three domains of the tubulin dimer , the Kar3 - MD , and the Vik1 - MHD are well separated . The tomographic analysis shown in Fig . 5B conﬁrms this ﬁnding . The motors have been ﬂushed with AMP – PNP , a non - hydrolyzable ATP analog used to mimic an ATP binding state . Under these conditions we found isolated Kar3 - MD to be strongly bound to microtubules while Vik1 - MHD’s bound with much lower afﬁnity . Accordingly , we assume that the domain in contact with the microtubule surface is the Kar3 - MD while the tethered domain is Vik1 - MHD . However , this remains to be deter - mined experimentally . Both features of Kar3Vik1 , the cooperative binding process ( Wendt et al . , 2002 ) , and the binding conformation with one - head - down , one - head - up is highly reminiscent of dimeric ncd con - structs ( Sosa et al . , 1997 ; Hirose et al . , 1998 ; Wendt et al . , 2002 ; Endres et al . , 2006 ) suggesting a common pattern for minus - end directed motors and the members of the kinesin - 14 family . Other dimeric kinesin MD’s prefer to bind with both heads simulta - neously to the microtubule surface and do not display the strong cooperativity seen here and with dimeric ncd ( kinesin - 1 : Hoenger et al . , 1998 , 2000 ; Eg5 : Krzysiak et al . , 2006 ) . 3 . 3 . The power of tomography in combination with volume averaging Although tomographic 3 - D reconstruction does not rely on any kind of averaging procedure , post - tomographic averaging consti - tutes a powerful tool to further enhance the signal to noise ratio in some parts of the tomogram . However , as in every averaging ap - proach , the structures subjected to averaging have to be identical else corrupted 3 - D maps prone to misinterpretations and false con - clusions will be obtained . The advantage of post - tomographic aver - aging lies in the fact that 3 - D structures are generally more easily assessed than 2 - D projections and often show more recognizable features . The difﬁculty with post - tomographic averaging , however , comes from the missing wedge of data that reduces the resolution particularly in the Z - direction and the resulting elongation of struc - tures in Z potentially interferes with the 3 - D alignment process . Our data on volume averaging presented here has been exclusively produced by our software suite PEET ( initial procedure described in Nicastro et al . , 2006 ; Mastronarde et al . , in preparation ) . The mathematical and computational details of the averaging process with PEET will be published elsewhere ( Mastronarde et al . , in preparation ) . In the case of kinesin – microtubule complexes the tomogram al - lows us to carefully inspect a microtubule for lattice defects and other irregularities . Once approved , we divide the microtubule into overlapping axial segments about 130 nm long , at intervals of 8 nm , making sure to include a full a b - tubulin repeat . While the lattice seams interrupt any helical symmetry , the sequence of cir - cular segments along the microtubule axis and each individual protoﬁlament are still identical . Once the segments have been se - lected , they are aligned according to the microtubule supertwist ( if there is one ) and averaged . The results are shown for a microtu - bule complexed with monomeric Eg5 ( Fig . 1B and C ; a total of 218 particles were averaged ) , a microtubule partially decorated with dimeric KarVik1 ( Fig . 3C ; 146 particles ) , Kar3Vik1 dimers bridging between two adjacent , parallel microtubules ( Fig . 4B ; 44 particles ) J . Cope et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 170 ( 2010 ) 257 – 265 263 and a microtubule fully decorated with Kar3Vik1 dimers ( Figs . 5A – E and 6A ; 99 particles ) . Two factors are of utmost importance here : ( i ) the usable tilt - range and ( ii ) the number of different angular views integrated . Even with a relatively large group of particles as shown in Fig . 1B and C where 218 particles have been averaged , some missing wedge effects remain visible such as a smeared - out density wall of badly separated protoﬁlaments along the z - axis , while the x - and y - axes show very clear separations . The same is visible in Figs . 3C , 5E , and 6A . This is an intrinsic effect of any single - tilt tomogram . For microtubule reconstructions that focus on 3 - D data surrounding the lattice seams this means no rotational averaging around the tubular axis can be done ( Fig . 1B and C ) and the only rotation that partially weakens the missing wedge effect comes from an axial supertwist ( see Fig . 1E and G ) . That supertwist is completely absent in 13 - protoﬁlament microtubules ( see Fig . 1D ) . The microtubule in Figs . 5 and 6 , however , is a helical 16 - protoﬁlament microtubule where rotational averaging due to the helical symmetry can be applied in addition to averaging axial segments ( Figs . 5F and 6D , E ) . We have done such averaging not by imposing rotational symmetry on the original average , but by sep - arately aligning each segment of the microtubule in 16 different orientations . The same rotational averaging could be done with any tomographic reconstruction of a microtubule that does not possess a seam , but only where features along protoﬁlaments are identical such as fully decorated motor – microtubule complexes . As shown in Figs . 5 and 6 , rotational averaging immediately in - creases the number of asymmetric units by the number of protoﬁl - aments ( i . e . 16 (cid:2) 99 = 1584 ) . The asymmetric unit is now reduced from an entire tubular slice to a single a b - tubulin – motor domain complex . Accordingly , the Fourier - shell correlation graphs reveal a signiﬁcantly increased signal to noise ratio , and an interpretable resolution ( i . e . visible detail not obscured by noise ) improvement from 3 . 8 nm to 3 . 2 nm ( Fig . 6C and F ) . 3 . 4 . Molecular details in cryo - electron tomograms Here , we demonstrate that cryo - electron tomography and heli - cal 3 - D approaches ( or any other averaging - based methods ) are highly complementary . We can conclude that cryo - electron tomography is an excellent method for any kind of assembly that lacks apparent symmetry and that precludes helical , single particle , or 2 - D crystalline averaging , such as the examples shown here in Figs . 1 , 3 , and 4 . Even without post - tomographic averaging , struc - tural details can be interpreted to about 4 nm resolution . For example , individual protoﬁlaments are spaced 5 nm laterally and 4 nm axially , features that are clearly visible in tomographic slices ( see Fig . 3B ) , at least when not obscured by the missing wedge ef - fect . Other structural features such as lattice angles and missing domains can be assessed reliably . However , molecular docking of small molecules such as kinesin motor domains remains difﬁcult at the current resolution limits attainable by cryo - electron tomog - raphy . Volume averaging , where applicable currently pushes the interpretable resolution close to 3 nm detail and may reach beyond 2 nm in the future . Here , features such as the two domains of the a b - tubulin dimer and the binding geometry of motor domains to microtubules can be reliably visualized ( see Fig . 5C ; and after rota - tional averaging : Figs . 5F and 6D , E ) . However , the theoretical res - olution attainable by post - tomographic averaging ultimately depends on the initial resolution that can be preserved from the raw images by tomographic reconstruction , which is the limiting factor in this case . Therefore , even for highly symmetric assemblies such as the helical 16 - protoﬁlament motor – microtubule complex shown in Figs . 5 and 6 , reaching better than 2 nm isotropic resolu - tion via a cryo - electron tomography approach may remain out of reach for a while longer .
