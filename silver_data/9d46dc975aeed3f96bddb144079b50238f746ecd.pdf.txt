In order to being able to satisfy the demand for high - quality products in an eicient manner , it is essential to utilize all means available . One area , which saw fast pace developments in terms of not only promising results but also usability , is machine learning . Promising an answer to many of the old and new challenges of manufacturing , machine learning is widely discussed by researchers and practitioners alike . However , the ield is very broad and even confusing which presents a challenge and a barrier hindering wide application . Here , this paper contributes in presenting an overview of available machine learning techniques and structuring this rather complicated area . A special focus is laid on the potential beneit , and examples of successful applications in a manufacturing environment . 1 . Introduction he manufacturing industry today is experiencing a never seen increase in available data ( Chand & Davis , 2010 ) . hese data compromise a variety of diferent formats , seman - tics , quality , e . g . sensor data from the production line , environmental data , machine tool parameters , etc . ( Davis et al . , 2015 ) . Diferent names are used for this phenomenon , e . g . Industrie 4 . 0 ( Germany ) , Smart Manufacturing ( USA ) , and Smart Factory ( South Korea ) . his increase and availability of large amounts of data is oten referred to as Big Data ( Lee , Lapira , Bagheri , & Kao , 2013 ) . he availability of , e . g . quality - related data ofers potential to improve process and product quality sustainably ( Elangovan , Sakthivel , Saravanamurugan , Nair , & Sugumaran , 2015 ) . However , it has been recognized that much information can also propose a challenge and may have a negative impact as it can , e . g . distract from the main issues / causalities or lead to delayed or wrong conclusions about appropriate actions ( Lang , 2007 ) . Overall , it can be safely concluded , the manufacturing industry has to accept that in order to beneit from the increased data availability , e . g . for quality improvement initiatives , KEYWORDS Manufacturing ; machine learning ; intelligent manufacturing systems ; smart manufacturing ARTICLE HISTORY Received 8 April 2016 Accepted 18 May 2016 CONTACT Thorsten Wuest thwuest @ mail . wvu . edu OPen ACCess D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 24 T . WuesT eT Al . manufacturing cost estimation and / or process optimization , better understanding of the customer’s requirements , etc . , support is needed to handle the high dimensionality , com - plexity , and dynamics involved ( Davis et al . , 2015 ; Loyer , Henriques , Fontul , & Wiseall , 2016 ; Wuest , 2015 ) . New developments in certain domains like mathematics and computer science ( e . g . sta - tistical learning ) and availability of easy - to - use , oten freely available ( sotware ) tools ofer great potential to transform the manufacturing domain and their grasp on the increased manufacturing data repositories sustainably . One of the most exciting developments is in the area of machine learning ( incl . data mining ( DM ) , artiicial intelligence ( AI ) , knowledge discovery ( KD ) from databases , etc . ) . However , the ield of machine learning is very diverse and many diferent algorithms , theories , and methods are available . For many manufactur - ing practitioners , this represents a barrier regarding the adoption of these powerful tools and thus may hinder the utilization of the vast amounts of data increasingly being available . In accordance to that , the paper aims to : • argue from a manufacturing perspective why machine learning is an appropriate and promising tool for today’s and future challenges ; • introduce the terminology used in the respective ields ; • present an overview of the diferent areas of machine learning and propose an overall structuring ; • provide the reader with a high - level understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of certain methods with respect to manufacturing application . In the following section , the current challenges manufacturing faces are illustrated . his provides a basis for the later argumentation of machine learning being an appropriate tool to for manufacturers to face those challenges head on . 1 . 1 . Challenges of the manufacturing domain Manufacturing is a very established industry , however the importance of it cannot be rated high enough . Several mature economies experienced a reduction of the manufacturing contribution toward their GDP over the last decades . However , in the last years , several initiatives to revamp the manufacturing sector were started . Examples are the US through ‘Executive Actions to Strengthen Advanced Manufacturing in America’ ( White House , 2014 ) and the European Union with their ‘Factories of the Future’ ( European Commission , 2016 ) initiative . he challenges manufacturing faces today are diferent from the challenges in the past . here are several studies available proposing key challenges of manufacturing on a global level . he key challenges most of the researchers agree upon ( Dingli , 2012 ; Gordon & Sohal , 2001 ; Shiang & Nagaraj , 2011 ; homas , Byard , & Evans , 2012 ) are the following : • Adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies . • Growing importance of manufacturing of high value - added products . • Utilizing advanced knowledge , information management , and AI systems . • Sustainable manufacturing ( processes ) and products . • Agile and lexible enterprise capabilities and supply chains . • Innovation in products , services , and processes . D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 PrODuCTIOn & MAnufACTurIng reseArCH : An OPen ACCess JOurnAl 25 • Close collaboration between industry and research to adopt new technologies . • New manufacturing management paradigms . hese key challenges highlight the ongoing trend of the manufacturing domain to becom - ing more complex and dynamic . he apparent complexity is inherited not only in the manufacturing programs themselves but increasingly in the to - be - manufactured product as well as in the ( business ) processes of the companies and collaborative networks ( Wiendahl & Scholtissek , 1994 ) . Adding to the challenge is the fact that the dynamic business envi - ronment of today’s manufacturing companies is afected by uncertainty ( Monostori , 2003 ) . Especially looking at domains most likely to being optimized , e . g . monitoring and control , scheduling and diagnostics , it becomes apparent that the increasing availability of data is adding another challenge : besides the large amounts of available date ( e . g . sensor data ) , the high dimensionality and variety ( e . g . due to diferent sensors or connected processes ) of data as well as the NP complete nature of manufacturing optimization problems ( Wuest , 2015 ) present a challenge . To overcome some of today’s major challenges of complex manufacturing systems , valid candidates are machine learning techniques . hese data - driven approaches are able to ind highly complex and non - linear patterns in data of diferent types and sources and trans - form raw data to features spaces , so - called models , which are then applied for prediction , detection , classiication , regression , or forecasting . In the following , irst the main advantages and challenges of machine learning applica - tions with regard to manufacturing , its challenges and requirements are illustrated . hen the current state of the art of machine learning , again with a focus on manufacturing applications is presented . Within that context , a structuring of diferent machine learning techniques and algorithms is developed and presented . 1 . 2 . Suitability of machine learning application with regard to today’s manufacturing challenges Before looking into the suitability of machine learning ( ML ) based on the previously derived requirements toward a future solution approach , the used terms are briely introduced . ML is known for its ability to handle many problems of NP - complete nature , which oten appear in the domain of smart manufacturing ( Monostori , Hornyák , Egresits , & Viharos , 1998 ) . he application of ML techniques increased over the last two decades due to various factors , e . g . the availability of large amounts of complex data with little transparency ( Smola & Vishwanathan , 2008 ) and the increased usability and power of available ML tools ( Larose , 2005 ) . Nevertheless , the main deinition of ML , allowing computers to solve problems without being speciically programmed to do so ( Samuel , 1959 ) is still valid today . ML is connected to other terms , like DM , KD , AI , and others ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . Today , ML is already widely applied in diferent areas of manufacturing , e . g . optimization , control , and troubleshooting ( Alpaydin , 2010 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . Many ML techniques ( e . g . Support Vector Machine [ SVM ] ) are designed to analyze large amounts of data and capable of handling high dimensionality ( > 1000 ) very well ( Yang & Trewn , 2004 ) . However , accompanying issues like possible over - itting has to be considered ( Widodo & Yang , 2007 ) during the application . If dimensionality proves to be an issue despite it being unlikely due to the power of the algorithms , there are methods available to D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 26 T . WuesT eT Al . reduce the dimensions . hese claim to reduce the impact of the reduction of the dimen - sionality on the expected results ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ; Manning , Raghavan , & Schütze , 2009 ) . he importance of using ML , in this case SVM is that dimensionality is not a practical problem and therefore the need for reducing dimensionality is reduced . his implies the possibility of being more liberal in including seemingly irrelevant information available in the manufacturing data that may turn out to be relevant under certain circumstances . his may have a direct efect on the existing knowledge gap described previously ( Alpaydin , 2010 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . Applying ML in manufacturing may result in deriving pattern from existing data - sets , which can provide a basis for the development of approximations about future behavior of the system ( Alpaydin , 2010 ; Nilsson , 2005 ) . his new information ( knowledge ) may support process owners in their decision - making or be used automatically to improve the system directly . In the end , the goal of certain ML techniques is to detect certain patterns or regularities that describe relations ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . Given the challenge of a fast changing , dynamic manufacturing environment , ML , being part of AI and inherit the ability to learn and adapt to changes ‘the system designer need not foresee and provide solutions for all possible situations’ ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . herefore , ML provides a strong argument why its application in manufacturing may be beneicial given the struggle of most irst - principle models to cope with the adaptability . Learning from and adapting to changing environments automatically is a major strength of ML ( Lu , 1990 ; Simon , 1983 ) . ML techniques are designed to derive knowledge out of existing data ( Alpaydin , 2010 ; Kwak & Kim , 2012 ) . Alpaydin ( 2010 ) emphasizes that ‘stored data becomes useful only when it is analyzed and turned into information that we can make use of , for example , to make predictions’ ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . his is especially true for manufacturing , given the struggle of obtaining real - time data during a live manufacturing program run with the technical , inancial , and knowledge restrictions . his may also have an impact on issue of positioning of process checkpoints ( Wuest , Liu , Lu , & hoben , 2014 ) . Whereas , it makes sense to select carefully checkpoints under the perspective of what data are useful , it may be obsolete given the analytical power of ML techniques to derive information from formerly considered use - less data . his may result in the ability to determine more states , to capture data , along the overall manufacturing program . Whether this is beneicial is an open question , which has to be researched . Given the ability of ML to handle high - dimensionality data , the technical side of analyzing the additional data provides no problem . However , in terms of capturing data it may still be a problem , speciically the ability to capture the data . Once the data are available , determining state drivers in very high - dimensionality situations is not considered problematic , nor is repeating it frequently . In the following table , a summary of the theoretical ability of ML techniques to answer the main challenges of manufacturing applications ( requirements ) is presented ( Table 1 ) . Overall , as Monostori , Márkus , Van Brussel , and Westkämper ( 1996 ) emphasize , ‘intel - ligence is strongly connected with learning , and learning ability must be an indispensable feature of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems . ’ ML provides strong arguments when it comes to the limitations and challenges the theoretical product state concept faces . Given the above - stated analysis , ML techniques seem to provide a promising solution based on the derived requirements . Most of the identiied requirements are successfully addressed by ML . D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 PrODuCTIOn & MAnufACTurIng reseArCH : An OPen ACCess JOurnAl 27 However , a more detailed analysis of available ML techniques as well as their strengths and limitations concerning the requirements has to be provided . Most of all , the possible compatibility with the theoretical product state concept and its perspective on the man - ufacturing program has to be elaborated further before a inal judgment can be given . Furthermore , there are many questions to be answered like how ML techniques may handle qualitative information . In the next section , the advantages and challenges of machine learning application in manufacturing are introduced based on the previous presented requirements . 2 . Advantages and challenges of machine learning application in manufacturing ML has been successfully utilized in various process optimization , monitoring and control applications in manufacturing , and predictive maintenance in diferent industries ( Alpaydin , 2010 ; Gardner & Bicker , 2000 ; Kwak & Kim , 2012 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ; Susto , Schirru , Pampuri , McLoone , & Beghi , 2015 ) . ML techniques were found to provide promising poten - tial for improved quality control optimization in manufacturing systems ( Apte , Weiss , & Grout , 1993 ) , especially in ‘complex manufacturing environments where detection of the causes of problems is diicult’ ( Harding , Shahbaz , & Kusiak , 2006 ) . However , oten ML applications are found to be limited focusing on speciic processes instead of the whole manufacturing program or manufacturing system ( Doltsinis , Ferreira , & Lohse , 2012 ) . here are many diferent ML methods , tools , and techniques available , each with distinct advantages and disadvantages . he domain of ML has grown to an independent research Table 1 . Summary of suitability of ML techniques in manufacturing application . Manufacturing requirement Theoretical ability of Ml to meet requirements Ability to handle high - dimensional problems and data - sets with reasonable eﬀort Certain ML techniques ( e . g . SVM ) are capable of handling high dimensionality ( > 1000 ) very well . However , accompanying issues like possible over - ﬁtting has to be considered ( Widodo & Yang , 2007 ; Yang & Trewn , 2004 ) Ability to reduce possibly complex nature of results and present transparent and concrete advice for practitioners ( e . g . monitor XX and parameter YY at checkpoint ZZ ) ML may be able to derive pattern from existing data and derive approximations about future behavior ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . This new information ( knowledge ) may support process owners in their decision - making or used to automatically improve a system Ability to adapt to changing environment with reasonable eﬀort and cost . Ideally a degree auf ‘automated’ adapta - tion to changing condition As ML is part of AI , and thus be able to learn and adapt to changes , ‘the system designer need not foresee and provide solutions for all possible situations’ ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . Learning from and adapting to changing environ - ments automatically is a major strength of ML ( Lu , 1990 ; Simon , 1983 ) Ability to further the existing knowledge by learning from results ML can contribute to create new information and possibly knowledge by , e . g . identifying patters in existing data ( Alpaydin , 2010 ; Pham & Aﬁfy , 2005 ) Ability to work with the available manufacturing data without special requirements toward capturing of very speciﬁc information at the start ML techniques are designed to derive knowledge out of existing data ( Alpaydin , 2010 ; Kwak & Kim , 2012 ) . ‘The stored data becomes useful only when it is analyzed and turned into information that we can make use of , for example , to make predictions’ ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) Ability to identify relevant process intra - and inter - relations & ideally correlation and / or causality The goal of certain ML techniques is to detect certain patterns or regularities that describe relations ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 28 T . WuesT eT Al . domain . herefore , within this section , the goal is to ind a suitable ML technique for application in manufacturing . 2 . 1 . Advantages of machine learning application in manufacturing he general advantages of ML have been established in previous sections stating that ML techniques are able to handle NP complete problems which oten occur when it comes to optimization problems of intelligent manufacturing systems ( Monostori et al . , 1998 ) . In the following , the focus is on the ability of ML techniques to handle high - dimensional , multi - variate data , and the ability to extract implicit relationships within large data - sets in a complex and dynamic , oten even chaotic environment ( Köksal , Batmaz , & Testik , 2011 ; Yang & Trewn , 2004 ) . ‘Since most engineering and manufacturing problems are data - rich but knowledge - sparse’ ( Lu , 1990 ) , ML provides a tool to increase the understanding of the domain . In this section , the advantages are presented in an attempt of generalization for ML in total . However , it has to be understood , that the peculiarity of the advantages may difer depending on the chosen ML technique . Overall it is agreed upon that ML allows to reduce cycle time and scrap , and improve resource utilization in certain NP - hard manufacturing problems . Furthermore , ML provides powerful tools for continuous quality improvement in a large and complex process such as semiconductor manufacturing ( Monostori et al . , 1998 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . An advantage of ML algorithms is the ability to handle high dimensional problems and data . Especially with regard to the increasing availability of complex data ( Yu & Liu , 2003 ) with little transparency in manufacturing ( Smola & Vishwanathan , 2008 ) , this will most likely become even more important in the future . However , as is true for most advantages and disadvantages of ML algorithms , this cannot be generalized . Some algorithms ( e . g . SVM ; Distributed Hierarchical Decision Tree ) can handle high dimensionality better than others ( Bar - Or , Wolf , Schuster , & Keren , 2005 ; Do , Lenca , Lallich , & Pham , 2010 ) . As was stated previously , in manufacturing mostly those ML algorithms are applicable that are capable of handling high - dimensional data . herefore , the ability to cope with high dimensionality is considered an advantage of ML application in manufacturing . Another advantage of ML techniques is the increased usability of application of algorithms due to ( oten source ) programs like Rapidminer . his allows ( relatively ) easy application in many cases and furthermore comfortable adjustment of parameters to increase the classi - ication performance . As previously stated , a major advantage of ML algorithms is to discover formerly unknown ( implicit ) knowledge and to identify implicit relationships in data - sets . Depending on the characteristic of the ML algorithm ( supervised / unsupervised or Reinforcement Learning [ RL ] ) , the requirements toward the available data may vary . However , the overall ability of ML algorithm to achieve results in a manufacturing environment was successfully proven ( e . g . Alpaydin , 2010 ; Filipic & Junkar , 2000 ; Guo , Sun , Li , & Wang , 2008 ; Kim , Kang , Cho , Lee , & Doh , 2012 ; Nilsson , 2005 ) . Given the speciic nature of manufacturing systems being dynamic , uncertain , and com - plex . Here , ML algorithms provide the opportunity to learn from the dynamic system and adapt to the changing environment automatically to a certain extent ( Lu , 1990 ; Simon , 1983 ) . he adaptation is , depending on the ML algorithm , reasonably fast and in almost all cases faster than traditional methods . D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 PrODuCTIOn & MAnufACTurIng reseArCH : An OPen ACCess JOurnAl 29 Applying ML in manufacturing may result in deriving pattern from existing data - sets , which can provide a basis for the development of approximations about future behavior of the system ( Alpaydin , 2010 ; Nilsson , 2005 ) . his new information ( knowledge ) may support process owners in their decision - making or used to automatically improve the system directly . In the end , the goal of certain ML techniques is to detect certain patterns or regularities that describe relations ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . Kotsiantis ( 2007 ) compared several algorithms according to their speciic performance in manufacturing application by diferent attributes . Even so , this presents the opportunity to get a irst impression , it is not suggested to base the decision for a suitable ML algorithm solely on comparisons as presented in such a table . Each problem is diferent and the per - formance of each algorithm also depends on the data available and data pre - processing as well as the parameter settings . he best itting algorithm has to be found in testing various ones in a realistic environment . his is discussed further in the next section . 2 . 2 . Challenges of machine learning application in manufacturing A very common challenge of ML application in manufacturing is the acquisition of relevant data . his is also a limitation as the availability , quality , and composition ( e . g . are meta - data included ? are data labeled ? ) of the manufacturing data at hand have a strong inluence on the performance of ML algorithms . Some challenges the data - set can contain are , e . g . high - di - mensional data can represent for some ML algorithms , that is , it can contain a high degree of irrelevant and redundant information which may impact the performance of learning algorithms ( Yu & Liu , 2003 ) . Today , most machine learning techniques handle only data with continuous and nominal values ( Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . How signiicant the inluence is , depends on various factors including the algorithm itself and the parameter settings . It can be considered a general challenge for most research in manufacturing and not only ML application , to get hold of any data due to , e . g . security concerns or a basic lack of data cap - turing during the process . Even though in most cases ML allows the extracting of knowledge and generates better results than most traditional methods with less requirements toward available data , certain aspects concerning the available data that can prevent the successful application still have to be considered . Together with the next point , this highlights the increased need to understand the data in order to apply ML . Hofmann ( 1990 ) highlights that compared to traditional methods where a lot of time is spent to extract information , in ML a lot of time is spent on preparing the data . Ater the available data are secured , the data oten have to be pre - processed depending on the requirements of the algorithm of choice . Pre - processing of data has a critical impact on the results . However , there are many standardized tools available which support the most common pre - processing processes like normalizing and iltering the data . Also it has to be checked whether the training data are unbalanced . his can present a challenge for the training of certain algorithms . In manufacturing practice , it is a common problem that values of certain attributes are not available or missing in the data - set ( Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . hese so - called missing values present a challenge for the application of ML algorithms . here are certain practical induction systems available which may ill the gap ( Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . However , each problem and later applied ML algorithm have speciic requirements when it comes to replacing missing values . By replacing missing values , the original data - set is inluenced . he goal is to reduce the bias and other negative inluence as much as possible D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 30 T . WuesT eT Al . in respect to the analysis goal . As this issue represents a very common challenge , there is a large amount of literature and practical solutions ( e . g . in R ) available ( e . g . Graham , 2012 ; Kabacof , 2011 ; Kwak & Kim , 2012 ; Li & Huang , 2009 ) . A major challenge of increasing importance is the question what ML technique and algorithm to choose ( selection of ML algorithm ) . Even so , there were attempts to pursue the deinition of ‘general ML techniques , ’ the diverse problems and their requirements highlight the need for specialized algorithms with certain strength and weaknesses ( Hofmann , 1990 ) . Especially due to the increased attention of practitioners and researchers for the ield of ML in manufacturing , a large number of diferent ML algorithms or at least variations of ML algorithms is available . Adding to this already existing complexity , combinations of diferent algorithms , so - called ‘hybrid approaches , ’ are becoming more and more common promising better results than ‘individual’ single algorithm application ( e . g . Lee & Ha , 2009 ) . Many studies are available highlighting a successful application of ML techniques for speciic problems . At the same time the test data are not publically available in many cases . his makes a neutral and unbiased assessment of the results and therefore a inal comparison challenging . As of today , the generally accepted approach to select a suitable ML algorithm for a certain problem is as follows : • First , one looks at the available data and how it is described ( labeled , unlabeled , avail - able expert knowledge , etc . ) to choose between a supervised , unsupervised , or RL approach . • Secondly , the general applicability of available algorithms with regard to the research problem requirements ( e . g . able to handle high dimensionality ) has to be analyzed . A speciic focus has to be laid on the structure , the data types , and overall amount of the available data , which can be used for training and evaluation . • hirdly , previous applications of the algorithms on similar problems are to be inves - tigated in order to identify a suitable algorithm . he term ‘similar’ in this case means , research problems with comparable requirements e . g . in other disciplines or domains . Another challenge is the interpretation of the results . It has to be taken into account that not only the format or illustration of the output is relevant for the interpretation but also the speciications of the chosen algorithm itself , the parameter settings , the ‘planed outcome’ and also the data including its pre - processing . Within the interpretation of the results , certain more distinct limitations ( again depending on the chosen algorithm ) can have a large impact . Among those are , e . g . immune to over - itting ( Widodo & Yang , 2007 ) , bias , and variance ( therefore bias – variance tradeof ) ( Quadrianto & Buntine , 2011 ) . 3 . Structuring of machine leaning techniques and algorithms As previously stated , ML has developed into a wide and divers ield of research over the past decades . his has led to a variety of diferent sub - domains , algorithms , theories , and application areas , etc . he relationship and structure between the diferent elements are not commonly agreed upon . Diferent researchers choose diferent approaches to structure the ield . In Figure 1 , the authors try to structure the ML domain of DM according to tasks on the one side and available algorithms on the other ( Corne , Dhaenens , & Jourdan , 2012 ) . his structure highlights the importance of diferentiation of task ( what is the goal ) and algorithm ( how can that goal be reached ) within the ML ield . D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 PrODuCTIOn & MAnufACTurIng reseArCH : An OPen ACCess JOurnAl 31 However , the presented overview in Figure 1 is falling short by not relecting the com - monly accepted diferentiation of ML methods by the available feedback in supervised , unsupervised , and RL ( Monostori , 1993 ; Kotsiantis , 2007 ; Monostori , 2003 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . Monostori ( 2003 ) described the three classes as follows : • ‘reinforcement learning : less feedback is given , since not the proper action , but only an evaluation of the chosen action is given by the teacher ; • unsupervised learning : no evaluation [ label ] of the action is provided , since there is no teacher ; • supervised learning : the correct response [ label ] is provided by a teacher . ’ his structure is widely accepted , however , there are still diferences with regard to what falls under them or what these three classes fall under . For example , Pham and Aify ( 2005 ) map supervised , unsupervised , and RL as part of Neural Networks ( NN ) ( see Figure 2 ) . However , Pham and Aify ( 2005 ) also state that they only focus on supervised classiication learning methods . his would correspond with Lu ( 1990 ) who states that inductive learning Figure 1 . An overview of tasks and main algorithms in DM ( Corne et al . , 2012 ) . Figure 2 . Classiﬁcation of main ML techniques according to Pham and Aﬁfy ( 2005 ) . D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 32 T . WuesT eT Al . can be grouped in supervised and unsupervised learning . Other researchers diferentiate between active and passive learning , stating that ‘active learning is generally used to refer to a learning problem or system where the learner has some role in determining on what data it will be trained’ ( Cohn , 2011 ) whereas passive learning describes a situation where the learner has no control over the training set . Apparently , active learning is oten used for problems where it is diicult ( expensive and / or time - consuming ) to obtain labeled training data . he advantage is to being able to achieve good performance needing less training data than other learners due to the sequentially identiied useful examples by the active learner ( Cohn , 2011 ) . Active learning is mostly applied within supervised ML scenarios but was also found to be of valuable within certain RL problems ( Cohn , 2011 ) . Some researchers like Kotsiantis ( 2007 ) focus only on supervised classiication techniques and group NN as a learning algorithm as part of supervised learning . However , NN algo - rithms can also be applied in unsupervised learning and RL ( Carpenter & Grossberg , 1988 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . his corresponds basically with Pham and Aify ( 2005 ) , when the notion on top of the hierarchy is seen as ‘Supervised ML’ instead of the ‘Machine learning’ they originally stated . An adapted and extended structuring of ML techniques and algorithms may be illus - trated as follows : Figure 3 does not include all available algorithms and algorithm variations . he purpose is to show the complex structure and the diverse nature of currently available and common ML techniques . Whereas the irst selection of the main diferentiation , supervised , unsupervised , and RL , suitable for the presented problem is in most cases possible , this is not necessarily the case when going further down the hierarchy . Additionally , it has to be kept in mind , that the diferent algorithms can be combined to maximize the classiication power ( Bishop , 2006 ) . Pham and Aify ( 2005 ) state that ‘most of the existing machine - learning methods for generating multiple models can improve signiicantly on the accuracy of single models’ ( Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . hat increases the complexity one has to face when in the process of selecting a suitable ML algorithm for a given problem , and thus the comprehensibility is hindered ( Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . Another interesting aspect is that many algorithms are applicable in both supervised and unsupervised learning ( in adapted form ) . he diferent algorithms and combinatory approaches oten tend to be adapted to spe - cial problems . his makes it hard to compare them especially against their classiication power for the given problem . A irst indication can be comparing charts as can be found Figure 3 . Structuring of ML techniques and algorithms . D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 PrODuCTIOn & MAnufACTurIng reseArCH : An OPen ACCess JOurnAl 33 in Kotsiantis ( 2007 ) . However , a more promising approach to select a suitable algorithm is to look for problems of similar nature and analyze what ML algorithm was used to solve it and what where the results . his is a good starting point . Once the algorithm is applied to the problem and irst results are available , diferent methods can be applied and the results for the given problem can be compared . Modern computer tools support diferent kernels and make the switch ( relatively ) comfortable . In the following , unsupervised machine learning , RL , and supervised machine learn - ing are briely described to being able to diferentiate them from one another . Supervised machine learning later described in greater detail as it was found to have the best it for challenges and problems faced in manufacturing applications and as manufacturing data is oten labeled , meaning expert feedback is available ( Lu , 1990 ) . 3 . 1 . Unsupervised machine learning Unsupervised machine learning is another large area of research . he deining attribute is that within unsupervised learning , there is no feedback from an external teacher / knowl - edgeable expert . he algorithm itself is supposed to identify clusters from existing data based on , e . g . conceptual cohesiveness of attributes ( Lu , 1990 ) . Kotsiantis ( 2007 ) introduced the rule that if instances are unlabeled ( no known labels and corresponding correct outputs ) , it is most likely unsupervised learning . he goal is to discover unknown classes of items by clustering ( Jain , Murty , & Flynn , 1999 ) whereas supervised learning is focused on classii - cation ( known labels ) . Basically , unsupervised ML describes any ML process that tries to learn ‘structure in the absence of either an identiied output [ e . g . supervised ML ] or feedback [ e . g . RL ] . hree typical examples of unsupervised learning are clustering , association rules , and self - organizing maps’ ( Sammut & Webb , 2011 ) . Especially in the Big Data context , unsupervised methods are becoming increasingly important . However , as in manufacturing application , the main assumption is that knowl - edgeable experts can provide feedback on the classiication of states to identify the learning set in order to train the algorithm ( Lu , 1990 ; Monostori , 2003 ) . hus , the focus will be laid on supervised methods . However , some aspects of unsupervised learning may be benei - cial in manufacturing application ater all . First , there is the possibility that in some cases there might be no expert feedback available or , in the future , desirable . Another aspect is to realize hybrid approaches , combing the ‘best of both worlds’ which gain importance due to the fast increase in unlabeled data especially in manufacturing ( Kang , Kim , & Cho , 2016 ) . And inally , unsupervised methods can be and are being used to , e . g . identify outliers in manufacturing data ( Hansson , Yella , Dougherty , & Fleyeh , 2016 ) . 3 . 2 . Reinforcement learning RL is deined by the provision of the training information by the environment . he infor - mation on how well the system performed in the respective turn is provided by a numerical reinforcement signal ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ) . Another deining characteristic is that the learner has to uncover which actions generate the best results ( numerical reinforcement signal ) by trying instead of being told . his distinguishes RL from most of the other ML methods ( Sutton & Barto , 2012 ) . However , RL is seen by some researchers as ‘a special form of supervised learning’ ( Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . However , diferent from supervised learning D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 34 T . WuesT eT Al . problems , RL problems can be described by the absence of labeled examples of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ behavior ( Stone , 2011 ) . RL , based on sequential environmental response , emulates the process of learning of humans ( Wiering & Van Otterlo , 2012 ) . his ‘reward signal , ’ which can be perceived in RL diferentiates it from unsupervised ML ( Stone , 2011 ) . Diferent from supervised learning , RL is most adequate in situation where there is no knowledgea - ble supervisor . In such uncharted territory , an agent is needed to being able to learn from interaction and its own experience – this is where RL can utilize its advantages ( Sutton & Barto , 2012 ) . As RL is based on feedback of actions , one interesting and also challenging issue is that certain actions have not or not only an immediate impact , but certain efects might show at a later time and / or during a following additional trial . Overall , RL ‘is deined not by characterizing learning methods , but by characterizing a learning problem . Any method that is well suited to solving that problem , [ might be considered ] to be a reinforcement learning method’ ( Sutton & Barto , 2012 ) . A very speciic challenge for RL is the tradeof between exploration and exploitation . In order to achieve the goal , the agent has to ‘exploit’ the actions it learned to prefer and to identify those it has to ‘explore’ by actively trying new ways ( Sutton & Barto , 2012 ) . In manufacturing , RL is not widely applied and just a few examples of successful application exist as of today ( Doltsinis et al . , 2012 ; Günther , Pilarski , Helfrich , Shen , & Diepold , 2015 ) . In the majority of manufacturing applications today , expert feedback is available . herefore , even though RL is applicable in manufacturing applications , the focus in the following is on supervised techniques . 3 . 3 . Supervised machine learning In manufacturing application , supervised ML techniques are mostly applied due to the data - rich but knowledge - sparse nature of the problems ( Lu , 1990 ) . In addition , supervised ML may beneit from the established data collection in manufacturing for statistical pro - cess control purposes ( Harding et al . , 2006 ) and the fact that these data are mostly labeled . Basically , supervised ML ‘is learning from examples provided by a knowledgeable external supervisor’ ( Sutton & Barto , 2012 ) . his is partly due to the availability of ( a ) expert feedback ( e . g . quality ) and ( b ) the labeled instances . Supervised ML is applied in diferent domains of manufacturing , monitoring , and control being a very prominent one among them ( e . g . Alpaydin , 2010 ; Apte et al . , 1993 ; Harding et al . , 2006 ; Kwak & Kim , 2012 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . he general process of supervised ML contains several steps handling the data and setting up the training and test data - set by the teacher , hence supervised ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ) . Based on a given problem , the required data are identiied and ( if needed ) pre - processed . An important aspect is the deinition of the training set , as it inluences the later classiication results to a large extent . Even so it oten appears as if the algorithm selection is always fol - lowing the deinition of the training data - set , the deinition of the training data also has to take the requirements of the algorithm selection into account . Some algorithms allow for a so - called ‘kernel selection’ to adapt the algorithm to the speciic nature of the problem . his highlights the adaptability of ML application and the variety of problems that can be tackled . Similar requirements stand to some extent also true for the identiication and pre - processing of the data as diferent algorithms have certain strength and weaknesses concerning the D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 PrODuCTIOn & MAnufACTurIng reseArCH : An OPen ACCess JOurnAl 35 handling of diferent data - sets ( e . g . format , dimensions , etc . ) . Ater an algorithm is selected , it is trained using the training data - set . In order to judge the ability to perform the targeted task , the trained algorithm is then evaluated using the evaluations data - set . Depending on the performance of the trained algorithm with the evaluation data - set , the parameters can be adjusted to optimize the performance in the case the performance is already good . In case the performance is not satisfying , the process has to be started over at an earlier stage , depending on the actual performance . A rule of thumb is that 70 % of the data - set is used as a training data - set , 20 % as an evalu - ation data - set ( in order to adjust the parameters – e . g . bias ) and inal 10 % as a test data - set . In the following section , supervised learning algorithms are illustrated in more detail as they are the most commonly used algorithms in manufacturing application today . A major reason being the availability of ‘labels’ based on quality inspections in many manufacturing application . 4 . Supervised machine learning algorithms in manufacturing application As can be seen in the previously presented igures , there are several supervised ML algo - rithms available . Each of these algorithms has speciic advantages and limitations concerning the application in manufacturing . A major challenge is to select a suitable algorithm for the requirements of the manufacturing research problem at hand . First , the general applicability of a ML algorithm with the requirements may be derived from more general comparisons ( e . g . presented by Kotsiantis ( 2007 ) ) . However , due to the individual nature , most research problems represent the speciic characteristics of ML algorithms as well as their adapted ‘siblings , ’ it is not advisable to base the decision for a ML algorithm solely on such a theo - retical and general selection . In order to being able to identify a suitable ML algorithm for the problem at hand , the next step involves a careful analysis of previous applications of ML algorithms on research problems with similar requirements . he research problems do not have to be located within the same domain , the major issue in this selection is the matching of the identiied requirements , in this case the ability to handle multi - variate , high - dimen - sional data - sets and the ability to continuously adapt to changing environments ( updating the learning set ) . A brief presentation of the main advantages and limitations of the diferent ML algorithms is presented in order to pre - select a group of potentially suitable techniques . A very promising and itting supervised ML algorithm for manufacturing research prob - lem is Statistical Learning Theory ( SLT ) . Within the theory of supervised learning , meaning the training of a machine to enable it ( without being explicitly programmed ) to choose a ( performing ) function describing the relation between inputs and output ( Evgeniou , Pontil , & Poggio , 2000 ) . SLT focuses on the question of ‘how well the chosen function generalizes , or how well it estimates the output for previously unseen inputs’ ( Evgeniou et al . , 2000 ) . Several more practical algorithms are based on the theoretical background of SLT , e . g . NNs , SVMs , and Bayesian modeling ( Brunato & Battiti , 2005 ) . A major advantage of SLT algorithms is the variety of possible application scenarios and possible application strategies ( Evgeniou , Poggio , Pontil , & Verri , 2002 ) . SLT allows to reduce the number of needed samples in certain cases ( Koltchinskii , Abdallah , Ariola , & Dorato , 2001 ) . SLT is also able to overcome issues like observer variability better than other methods ( Margolis , Land , Gottlieb , & Qiao , 2011 ) . In some other cases , SLT still needs a large number of samples to perform ( Cherkassky & Ma , 2009 ; Koltchinskii et al . , 2001 ) . Another challenge D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 36 T . WuesT eT Al . for the application of SLT is the likelihood of over - itting in some realizations ( Evgeniou et al . , 2002 ) . However , Steel ( 2011 ) found that the Vapnik – Chernovnenkis dimension is a good predictor for the chance of over - itting using STL . Furthermore , the computational complexity is not eliminated using SLT but rather avoided by relaxing design questions ( Koltchinskii et al . , 2001 ) . Bayesian Networks ( BNs ) may be deined as a graphical model describing the probability relationship among several variables ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ) . BNs are among the most well - known applications of SLT ( Brunato & Battiti , 2005 ) . Naïve Bayesian Networks represent a rather simple form of BNs , being composed of directed acyclic graphs ( one parent , multiple chil - dren ) ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ) . Among the advantages of BN are the limited storage requirements , the possibility to use it as an incremental learner , its robustness to missing values , and the easiness to grasp output . However , the tolerance toward redundant and interdependent attributes is understood to be very limited ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ) . Instance - Based Learning ( IBL ) ( Kang & Cho , 2008 ; Okamoto & Yugami , 2003 ) or Memory - Based Reasoning ( MBR ) ( Kang & Cho , 2008 ) are mostly based on k - nearest neigh - bor ( k - NN ) classiiers and applied in , e . g . regression and classiication ( Kang & Cho , 2008 ) . Even though IBL / MBR techniques have proven to achieve high accuracy of classiication in some cases ( Akay , 2011 ) , a stable and good performance ( Gagliardi , 2011 ; Zheng , Li , & Wang , 2010 ) and were found to be applicable in many diferent domains ( Dutt & Gonzalez , 2012 ) , when looking at the previously identiied requirements they seem not to be the best match . Reasons why IBL / MBR are excluded from further investigation are , among other things , their diiculty to set the attribute weight vector in little known domains ( Hickey & Martin , 2001 ) , the complicated calculations needed if large numbers of training instances / test patterns and attributes are involved ( Kang & Cho , 2008 ; Okamoto & Yugami , 2003 ) , less adaptable learning procedures ( tends to over - itting with noisy data ) ( Gagliardi , 2011 ) , task - dependency ( Dutt & Gonzalez , 2012 ; Gonzalez , Dutt , & Lebiere , 2013 ) , and time - sen - sitive to complexity ( Gonzalez et al . , 2013 ) . NN or Artiicial Neural Networks are inspired by the functionality of the brain . he brain is capable of performing impressive tasks ( e . g . vision , speech recognition ) , tasks that may proof beneicial in engineering application when transferred to a machine / artiicial system ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . NN simulate the decentralized ‘computation’ of the central nerv - ous system by parallel processing ( in reality or simulated ) and allow an artiicial system to perform unsupervised , reinforcement , and supervised learning tasks ( e . g . pattern rec - ognition ) ( Corne et al . , 2012 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . Decentralization makes use of a high ‘number of simple , highly interconnected processing elements or nodes and incorporates the ability to process information by a dynamic response of these nodes and their connec - tions to external inputs’ ( Cook , Zobel , & Wolfe , 2006 ) . hese NN play an important role in today’s ML research ( Nilsson , 2005 ) . Today’s application of NN can be seen as being on the representation and algorithm level ( Alpaydin , 2010 ) . NN are applied in various ields of manufacturing ( e . g . semiconductor manufacturing ) and diverse problems ( e . g . process control ) ( Harding et al . , 2006 ; Lee & Ha , 2009 ; Wang , Chen , & Lin , 2005 ) which highlights their main advantage : their wide applicability ( Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . Besides the wide appli - cability , NN are capable of handling high - dimensional and multi - variate data on a similar rate to the later introduced SVM ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ) . Manallack and Livingstone ( 1999 ) found NN to ‘ofer high accuracy in most cases but can sufer from over - ﬁtting the training data’ ( Manallack & Livingstone , 1999 ) . However , in order to achieve the high accuracy , a D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 PrODuCTIOn & MAnufACTurIng reseArCH : An OPen ACCess JOurnAl 37 large sample size is required by NN ( similar to SVM ) ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ) . Over - itting , con - nected to the high - variance algorithms is commonly accepted as a drawback of NN ( again partly similar to SVMs ) ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ) . Other challenges of applying NN include the complexity of the models they produce , the intolerance concerning missing values and the ( oten ) time - consuming training ( Kotsiantis , 2007 ; Pham & Aify , 2005 ) . he previously described SLT builds the theoretical foundation of a rather new and very promising ML algorithm that attracts increasing attention in recent years due to its generally high performance , ability to achieve high accuracy , and ability to handle high - dimensional , multi - variate data - sets – SVM . SVMs were introduced by Cortes and Vapnik ( 1995 ) as a new machine learning technique for two - group classiication problems . Burbidge , Trotter , Buxton , and Holden ( 2001 ) found SVM to be a ‘robust and highly accurate intelligent classiication technique well suited for structure – activity relationship analysis . ’ SVM can be understood as a practical methodology of the theoretical framework of STL ( Cherkassky & Ma , 2009 ) . SVMs have a proven track record for successfully dealing with non - linear problems ( Li , Liang , & Xu , 2009 ) . he idea behind it is that input vectors are non - linearly mapped to a very high - dimensional feature space ( Cortes & Vapnik , 1995 ) . SVM can be combined with diferent kernels and thus adapt to diferent circumstances / requirements ( e . g . NNs ; Gaussian ) ( Keerthi & Lin , 2003 ) . SVM as a classiication technique has its roots in SLT ( Khemchandani & Chandra , 2009 ; Salahshoor , Kordestani , & Khoshro , 2010 ) and has shown promising empirical results in a number of practical manufacturing applications ( Chinnam , 2002 ; Widodo & Yang , 2007 ) and works very well with high - dimensional data ( Azadeh et al . , 2013 ; Ben - hur & Weston , 2010 ; Salahshoor et al . , 2010 ; Sun , Rahman , Wong , & Hong , 2004 ; Wu , 2010 ; Wuest , Irgens , & hoben , 2014 ) . Current literature suggests that the performance of SVM compared to other ML methods is still very competitive ( Jurkovic , Cukor , Brezocnik , & Brajkovic , 2016 ) . Another aspect of this approach is that it represents the decision boundary using a subset of the training examples , known as the support vectors . Ensemble Methods are a class of machine learning algorithms that combine a weighted committee of learners to solve a classiication or regression problem . he committee or ensemble contains a number of base learners like NNs , trees , or nearest neighbor ( Dietterich , 2000 ; Opitz & Maclin , 1999 ) . In many cases , the base learners are from the same algorithm family , which is called a homogeneous ensemble . In contrast to that , a heterogeneous exam - ple is constructed by combining base learners of diferent types . For many machine learn - ing problems , it is demonstrated that the ensemble leads to a better model generalization compared to a single base classiier ( Zhou , 2012 ) . To construct the base classiiers , two main paradigms have demonstrated their predictive power . On the one hand , sequential ensemble methods use the output from a base classiier as an input of the following base classiier and therefore boost the output in a sequential way . AdaBoost , introduced by Freund and Schapire ( 1995 ) , is a well - known example , where simple decision stumps are combined toward a complex boosting cascade . On the other hand , parallel adjustment of base classiiers leads to independent models , which is also named Bagging . One famous example of bagging methods is Random Forest ( Breiman , 2001 ) , which is a combination of randomly sampled tree predictors . In a irst step , Random forest randomly selects a subset of the features space , and then performs a conventional split selection procedure within the selected feature subset . Deep Machine Learning is a new area of machine learning that allows the process - ing of data in multiple processing layers toward highly non - linear and complex feature D o w n l o a d e d by [ U n i v e r s it y o f S t r a t h c l yd e ] a t 03 : 13 03 A ugu s t 2016 38 T . WuesT eT Al . representations . he ield is mainly driven by the computer vision and language processing domain ( LeCun , Bengio , & Hinton , 2015 ) but ofers great potential to also boost data - driven manufacturing applications . Deep Convolutional Neural Networks ( ConvNets ) have demonstrated outstanding prediction performance in various ields of computer vision and won several contests , e . g . ( Krizhevsky , Sutskever , & Hinton , 2012 ) . In contrast to stand - ard NNs , where each neuron from layer n is connected to all neurons in layer ( n − 1 ) , a ConvNet is constructed by multiple ilter stages with a restricted view and therefore well suited for image , video , and volumetric data ( LeCun et al . , 1989 ) . From layer to layer , a ConvNet transforms the output of the previous layer in a higher abstraction by applying non - linear activation . In manufacturing scenarios , data streams or data with temporal behavior are of major importance . Especially deep recurrent neural nets have demonstrated the ability to model temporal patterns , e . g . in time series data . Here , an important concept is the Long – Short - Term Memory Model which is a more general architecture of deep NNs ( Hochreiter & Schmidhuber , 1997 ) . 5 . Application areas of supervised machine learning in manufacturing As was illustrated in the previous section , there is a wide variety of diferent ML algorithms available . Each of them has speciic advantages and disadvantages . In order to give an over - view of successful applications of ML in manufacturing systems , selected applications of an exemplary supervised machine learning algorithm , SVMs , are illustrated . A major application area of SVM in manufacturing is monitoring ( Chinnam , 2002 ) . Especially tool / machine condition monitoring , fault diagnosis , and tool wear are domains where SVM is continuously and successfully applied ( Azadeh et al . , 2013 ; Salahshoor et al . , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2004 ; Widodo & Yang , 2007 ) . Also quality monitoring in manufacturing is a ield where SVMs were successfully applied ( Ribeiro , 2005 ) . An application area of SVM with an overlap to manufacturing application is image recog - nition ( e . g . character and face recognition ) ( Salahshoor et al . , 2010 ; Widodo & Yang , 2007 ; Wu , 2010 ) . In manufacturing , this can be utilized to identify ( classify ) damaged products ( e . g . surface roughness ) ( Çaydaş & Ekici , 2010 ) . Other application areas are , e . g . handwrit - ing classiication ( Scheidat , Leich , Alexander , & Vielhauer , 2009 ) . Time series forecasting is also a domain where SVM optimization is oten applied ( Guo et al . , 2008 ; Salahshoor et al . , 2010 ; Tay & Cao , 2002 ) . Besides manufacturing and image recognition , SVMs are oten used within the med - icine domain . Among the many areas of application within this domain , the use of SVM in cancer research is standing out ( Furey et al . , 2000 ; Guyon , Weston , Barnhill , & Vapnik , 2002 ; Rejani & Selvi , 2009 ) . Other medical application areas are , e . g . drug design ( Burbidge et al . , 2001 ) and detection of microcalciications ( El - naqa , Yang , Wernick , Galatsanos , & Nishikawa , 2002 ) . Further application areas include but are not limited to credit rating ( Huang , Chen , Hsu , Chen , & Wu , 2004 ) , food quality control ( Borin , Ferrão , Mello , Maretto , & Poppi , 2006 ) , classiication of polymers ( Li et al . , 2009 ) , and rule extraction ( Martens , Baesens , Van Gestel , & Vanthienen , 2007 ) . hese examples from various industries and optimization problems highlight the wide applicability and adaptability of the SVM algorithm .

Conclusion and outlook In this paper , irst the challenges of modern manufacturing systems , e . g . increasing com - plexity , dynamic , high dimensionality , and chaotic structures are highlighted . Following , machine learning limitations and advantages from a manufacturing perspective were dis - cussed before a structuring of the diverse ield of machine learning is proposed and an overview of the basic terminology of this inter - disciplinary ield is presented . he structure is distinguishing unsupervised machine learning , RL , and supervised machine learning as a possible way to group the available algorithms and applications . It was argued that supervised learning is a good it for most manufacturing applications due to the fact that the majority of manufacturing applications can provide labeled data . Based on this dis - tinction , the most commonly used supervised machine learning algorithms are presented . hereater , an exemplary illustration of successful application in manufacturing of the supervised machine learning algorithm SVMs is presented . his overview highlights the adaptability and variety of usage opportunities in the ield . With fast paced developments in the area of algorithms and increasing availability of data ( e . g . due to low cost sensors and the shit toward smart manufacturing ) and comput - ing power , the applications for machine learning especially in manufacturing will increase further at a rapid pace . As of today , supervised algorithms have the upper hand in most application in the manufacturing domain . However , with the fast increase in available data , thanks to more and better sensor technologies and increased awareness , unsupervised methods ( including RL ) may increase in importance in the future . Already today , hybrid approaches are being used that ofer ‘the best of both worlds . ’ his corresponds with the attention the Big Data developments received in recent years . Concluding , it can be said with conidence , ML is already a powerful tool for many applications within ( intelligent ) manu - facturing systems and smart manufacturing and its importance will increase further in the future . Its interdisciplinary nature presents a big opportunity but also a signiicant risk at the same time as collaboration between diferent disciplines , like Computer Science , Industrial Engineering , Mathematics , and Electrical Engineering is necessary to drive progress .
