(cid:2) The eGFP - His 6 / NTA ( Ni ) dissociation constants could serve as reference for other His 6 - tagged proteins reconstituted in GUVs . (cid:2) We provide a conversion between K d and K P for the His 6 - NTA ( Ni ) system , which can be extended to any protein - lipid interaction with a known 1 : 1 stoichiometry . (cid:2) Protein diffusion coef ﬁ cients could be used as an indicator of crowding effects . (cid:2) As for DOPC / DGS - NTA ( Ni ) the lipid dynamics is independent of increasing protein con - centrations , the ATTO - 647N - DOPE diffusion coef ﬁ cient could serve as a standard . 1 . Data Hexahistidine - tag ( His 6 ) binding to Nickel ( Ni ) chelated with nitrilotriacetic acid ( NTA ) is a well - characterized process [ 2 , 3 ] and it is extensively used to reconstitute protein systems in giant uni - lamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) [ 4 – 6 ] . We made GUVs consisting of 1 , 2 - di - ( 9 Z - octadecenoyl ) - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholin ( DOPC ) and 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 mol % 1 , 2 - di - ( 9 Z - octadecenoyl ) - sn - glycero - 3 - [ ( N - ( 5 - amino - 1 - carboxypentyl ) iminodiacetic acid ) succinyl ] nickel salt ( DGS - NTA ( Ni ) ) , labeled with 0 . 05 mol % ATTO - 647N - DOPE . These GUVs were incubated with increasing amounts of His 6 - tagged enhanced green ﬂ uorescent protein ( eGFP - His 6 ) and point ﬂ uorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) was performed both at the top pole of the GUVs and in solution . From the obtained FCS auto - correlation functions the diffusion coef ﬁ cient D of both eGFP - His 6 and ATTO - 647N - DOPE as well as the dissociation constant K d of the NTA ( Ni ) / eGFP - His 6 system were calculated .

Experimental design , materials and methods The materials , the preparation of eGFP - His 6 and GUVs , the optical setup used and the FCS data acquisition / analysis were described elsewhere [ 1 ] . 2 . 1 . Determination of average diffusion coef ﬁ cients We determined the average diffusion coef ﬁ cients D of eGFP - His 6 attached to DGS - NTA ( Ni ) in the lipid bilayer and of ATTO ‐ 647N ‐ DOPE ( Table 1 and Fig . 1 ) by applying the following equation : D ¼ ω 0 2 4 τ 2 D ð 1 Þ The average focal waist w 0 obtained from a calibration with Alexa488 and with ATTO - 655 , were w 0 ¼ 218 : 0 7 6 : 0 nm ( mean 7 s . e . m , n ¼ 19 ) and w 0 ¼ 246 : 2 7 4 : 6 nm ( mean 7 s . e . m , n ¼ 19 ) , respectively . The diffusion times τ 2 D were determined ﬁ tting the auto - correlation curves with a weighted 2 D (cid:3) 3 D þ T model function . The D values were averaged and the signi ﬁ cance of their deviation was tested using a one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) in SigmaPlot 12 . 3 ( Systat Soft - ware , Inc . , San Jose , CA ) . This statistical analysis indicated a signi ﬁ cance of deviation for the average diffusion coef ﬁ cients of eGFP - His 6 in presence of different DGS - NTA ( Ni ) concentrations ( F ( 3 , 78 ) ¼ 19 . 48 , p o 0 . 001 ) . With increasing amount of DGS - NTA ( Ni ) , the eGFP - His 6 average diffusion coef ﬁ - cients decreases from D ¼ 4 : 36 7 1 : 12 m m 2 = s ( mean 7 combined s . e . m . , n ¼ 548 ) to D ¼ 1 : 90 7 1 : 01 m m 2 = s ( mean 7 combined s . e . m . , n ¼ 593 ) . In contrast , the average diffusion coef ﬁ - cient of ATTO - 647N DOPE for all concentrations DGS - NTA ( Ni ) was D ¼ 9 : 81 7 0 : 70 m m 2 = s ( mean 7 combined s . e . m . , n ¼ 3123 ) and did not show any statistical signi ﬁ cant difference ( F ( 3 , 86 ) ¼ 3 . 24 , p ¼ 0 . 026 ) . 2 . 2 . K d for eGFP - His 6 DGS - NTA ( Ni ) system Only in cases where the protein - lipid binding is purely stoichiometric and if the stoichiometry is known , the protein af ﬁ nity for the lipid membrane can be expressed by the dissociation constant K d . In equilibrium , an identical number of molecules P will dissociate from and associate to the lipid Fig . 1 . Diffusion coef ﬁ cients determined by GUV - FCS assay .

Error bars represent the combined standard error of mean . The D of ATTO ‐ 647N ‐ DOPE shows no signi ﬁ cant differences , whereas the D of eGFP - His 6 decreases with increasing amounts of DGS - NTA ( Ni ) . F . A .

For 1 : 1 binding stoichiometry ð n ¼ 1 Þ , K d is de ﬁ ned as : K d ¼ P f (cid:1) (cid:3) L f (cid:1) (cid:3) ½ PL (cid:4) ð 2 Þ where P f (cid:1) (cid:3) is the freely diffusing species in solution , PL ½ (cid:4) ¼ P m ½ (cid:4) the membrane associated fraction and L f (cid:1) (cid:3) ¼ L ½ (cid:4)(cid:3)½ L m (cid:4) with the total accessible lipid concentration L ½ (cid:4) c L m ½ (cid:4) . Thus , K d ¼ P f (cid:1) (cid:3) L ½ (cid:4) ½ P m (cid:4) ¼ k off k on ð 3 Þ L ½ (cid:4) is constant in a given sample and can be expressed by : L ½ (cid:4) ¼ A A L N A V ð 4 Þ Here , A is the total accessible lipid area , A L the area per lipid , N A the Avogadro ' s constant and V the volume of the sample chamber . P f (cid:1) (cid:3) and P m ½ (cid:4) can be determined by FCS [ 1 ] . In particular , P m ½ (cid:4) is obtained by : P m ½ (cid:4) ¼ P 2 D ½ (cid:4) A V ð 5 Þ where P 2 D ½ (cid:4) is the surface concentration on the top pole of a GUV . A rearrangement of Eq . ( 3 ) gives : P m ½ (cid:4) ¼ ½ L (cid:4) K d P f (cid:1) (cid:3) ð 6 Þ Combining Eq . ( 6 ) with Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) gives the following main equation ( A and V cancel out ) : P 2 D ½ (cid:4) ¼ 1 K d A L N A P f (cid:1) (cid:3) ð 7 Þ When a set of P f (cid:1) (cid:3) and P 2 D ½ (cid:4) is plotted and ﬁ tted with a linear equation passing through the origin of the axis , K d can be calculated from the slope a : K d ¼ 1 aA L N A ð 8 Þ Comparing Eq . ( 8 ) with Eq . ( 7 ) in Thomas et al . [ 1 ] leads to the following conversion between K d and partition coef ﬁ cient K P : K P W ¼ 1 K d ð 9 Þ with the water concentration W ½ (cid:4) being constant with W ½ (cid:4) ¼ W ¼ 55 : 5 M . Assuming that the binding stoichiometry for the NTA ( Ni ) / eGFP - His 6 system is 1 : 1 [ 2 , 7 ] , we could calculate the dissociation constant K d from the reported partitioning coef ﬁ cient K P [ 1 ] with Eq . ( 9 ) or directly from the slope a with Eq . ( 8 ) . In Table 2 and Fig . 2 the values of the dissociation constant K d are given for the different content of DGS - NTA ( Ni ) . They correspond to the upper range of values reported in the literature , which vary from 10 nM to 10 μ M [ 7 – 9 ] . Table 2 K d determined by GUV - FCS assay .
