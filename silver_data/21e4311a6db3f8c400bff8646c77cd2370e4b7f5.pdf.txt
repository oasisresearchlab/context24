1 On size and growth of cells . Arezki Boudaoud Department of Mathematics , MIT , 2 - 335 , Cambridge MA02139 , USA and Laboratoire de Physique Statistique de l(cid:213)ENS , 24 , rue Lhomond , 75231 PARIS , France Understanding how growth induces form is a longstanding biological question 1 - 6 . Many studies concentrated on the shapes of plant cells 2 , fungi 3 or bacteria 3 - 5 . Some others have shown the importance of the mechanical properties of bacterial walls 5 and plant tissues 6 in pattern formation . Here I sketch a simple physical picture of cell growth . The study is focussed on isolated cells that have walls . They are modeled as thin elastic shells containing a liquid , which pressure drives the growth as generally admitted for bacteria 4 or plant cells 7 . Requiring mechanical equilibrium leads to estimations of typical cell sizes , in quantitative agreement with compiled data 8 - 27 including bacteria , cochlear outer hair , fungi , yeast , root hair and giant alga cells . The starting point is a crude physical description of a cell ( fig . 1 a ) . A liquid ( the cytoplasm ) is contained in a thin elastic shell ( the cell wall ) . The physical parameters involved are the cell radius of curvature R , the wall thickness h , the elastic modulus of the wall material E and the pressure P exerted on the wall ( or the turgor pressure ) . P is the difference between pressures inside and outside the cell . In this Letter , I derive scaling laws relating these parameters and test them with experimental data . The analysis relies on the following remarks . The turgor pressure and the thickness of the wall are mainly regulated by the cell physiology . Wall growth is similar to plastic 2 deformations as established for plant cells 7 : The wall behaves as an elastic material below a critical strain a y and grows above by yielding to stress . So , the wall is modeled as a perfectly plastic material 28 , which yields in extension and not in compression ( see fig . 1 b ) . The cell can also regulate the wall plasticity 7 . I assume that the wall has no intrisic ( natural ) curvature when it is formed . Finally , the growth is slow : The characteristic time for growth is much larger than the time needed to reach mechanical equilibrium . Consequently , the cell is considered to be at mechanical equilibrium . I first estimate the cell mechanical energy , which is minimal at equilibrium . A thin shell has two modes of deformation : Stretching and bending 29 . The stretching energy is proportional to the strain squared , but if the material undergoes plastic deformations ( see fig . 1 b ) , then energy is stored only below the yield strain a y , so the stretching energy ( per unit surface ) scales as E s ~ Eha y 2 . The elastic energy ( per unit surface ) for bending is proportional to the square of the mean curvature , E b ~ Eh 3 / R 2 . In bending , the outside half of the wall ( with respect to the center of curvature ) is elongated while the inside half is compressed . When plastic flow occurs , it is restricted to the outside of the wall , because the material is considered to yield only in extension ( fig 1 b ) . In this case the effective thickness is reduced in the bending energy by factor of about 2 : Its order of magnitude remains the same . The potential energy ( per unit surface ) corresponding to the turgor pressure is proportional to the volume / area ratio , E t ~ PR . The yield strain for most materials is smaller than of 10 - 2 , while h / R for most cells varies between 10 - 2 and 10 - 1 . So , it is reasonable to consider the limiting case when a y < < h / R , 3 so that E s < < E b . In this case , a characteristic size for cell sizes results from the balance between bending and pressure ( E b ~ E t ) , R = a h ( E / P ) 1 / 3 . ( 1 ) A simple calculation assuming that the wall adopts locally the shape of a sphere of radius R and using the equation for the bending of thin plates 29 gives a ~ 1 . 3 ( the exact value depends on the Poisson ratio of the material ) . The best fit to the compiled experimental data ( fig . 2 b ) gives a = 4 . 0 , of the same order of magnitude . The agreement is good , although I have neglected the anisotropy of the wall , which is probably important in pattern generation . One might notice a departure from the law ( 1 ) at small radii in fig . 2 . This motivates the study of the opposite limit a y > > h / R for bacteria and cochlear hair cells . Indeed , experiments by Koch ( see ref . 5 ) have shown that the typical strain for bacillus subtilis is a y = 0 . 45 . In this limit , stretching balances the turgor pressure . The longitudinal tension for a cylindrical shell 5 , 29 is T = PR / 2 . If the wall yields then T = Eha y ( using fact that the Poisson ratio is small for a strongly anisotropic polymer as peptidoglycan 5 ) . So the cell typical radius is R = b h ( E / P ) . ( 2 ) Here b = 2 a y ~ 0 . 9 , in agreement with b = 1 . 0 obtained from the fit to the experimental data ( fig . 2 b ) . Here I have implicitly assumed that the yield strain a y varies very little for this class of cells . I have neglected the possible electric charges , which could be important in the wall shape 5 . The elastic tension Eha y is probably the origin of the tension used in the Surface Stress Theory 4 to describe the shape of bacteria . 4 To summarize , a preferred radius of curvature for growing cells has been determined from the balance between the turgor and elastic forces ( bending or stretching depending on the wall yielding properties ) . A possible physical picture is that isolated cells grow more or less spherically until this preferred radius is reached . Then they adopt a cylindrical shape to keep this radius . This remark could account for the widespread existence of isolated elongated cells : root hairs , pollen tubes , fungal hyphae , alga cells(cid:201) One can also notice that the scaling laws ( eqs . 1 - 2 ) roughly correspond to tip growing cells and cells undergoing diffuse growth respectively . The present results could motivate ( and would need ) new measurements of the elastic properties of cell walls . They would be the basis for a quantitative theory for cell growth . Methods The wall elastic modulus E , the turgor P , the cell radius R ( the radius of the cylindrical part for elongated cells ) and the wall thickness h were collected as described in the following .
