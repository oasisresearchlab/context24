We report a prospective epidemiological , virological and serological investigation of 83 a SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak in a primary school in Geneva , Switzerland , in April - May 2021 . 84 Methods 85 This outbreak investigation is part of a longitudinal , prospective , primary school - based 86 surveillance study ( SEROCoV - Schools ) . It involved repeated testing of pupils and teachers 87 and household members of participants who tested positive . Rapid antigen tests and / or real - 88 time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed at Day 0 - 2 and Day 5 - 7 ; 89 serologies on dried capillary blood samples were performed at Day 0 - 2 and Day 30 . Contact 90 tracing interviews and SARS - CoV - 2 whole genome sequencing were carried out for positive 91 cases . 92 Results 93 This SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak caused by the Alpha variant involved 20 children aged 4 to 6 94 years from 4 classes , 2 teachers and 3 household members . Infection attack rates were 95 between 11 . 8 and 62 . 0 % among pupils from the 4 classes , 22 . 2 % among teachers and 0 % 96 among non - teaching staff . Secondary attack rate among household members was 10 . 7 % . 97 Symptoms were reported by 63 % of infected children , 100 % of teachers and 66 . 7 % of 98 household members . All analysed sequences but one showed 100 % identity . Serological tests 99 detected 8 seroconversions unidentified by SARS - CoV - 2 virological tests . 100 Conclusions 101 This study confirmed child - to - child and child - to - adult transmission of the infection . SARS - 102 CoV - 2 can spread rapidly between children and adults in school settings , and is thereby 103 introduced into households . Effective measures to limit transmission in schools have the 104 potential to reduce the overall community circulation . 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 All rights reserved .

This has led most countries worldwide to implement school closures as an 119 important component of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) 120 transmission mitigation policies from the very beginning of the pandemic [ 4 ] . 121 Young children commonly have fewer and milder symptoms of SARS - CoV - 2 infection than 122 adults , with a high proportion of asymptomatic infections , and are less likely to experience 123 severe COVID - 19 [ 5 ] . However , epidemiological and biological data suggest that , when 124 infected , children may transmit as much as adults , as children achieve viral loads comparable , 125 or only minimally lower , to those of adults at the time of diagnosis [ 6 – 10 ] . 126 At school , young children have many prolonged close contacts with peers and adults in indoor 127 setting [ 11 ] , usually do not wear masks , and in many countries they are not systematically 128 tested when symptomatic , including in Switzerland [ 12 ] . These circumstances make children 129 and schools a potential strong contributor of the overall community SARS - CoV - 2 130 transmission [ 13 ] . Yet , twenty - one months into the pandemic , the extent to which young 131 children are infected and transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in school settings remains controversial 132 [ 5 , 14 ] , in particular with variants of concern . Evidence on transmission direction ( adult - to - 133 child , child - to - child , child - to - adult ) is also lacking . 134 We aim to report a prospective epidemiological , virological and serological investigation of a 135 SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak in a primary school in Geneva , Switzerland , in April - May 2021 . 136 Methods 137 Study design 138 All rights reserved .

The study started in March 2021 . Participants had a baseline assessment which 143 included SARS - CoV - 2 serology from a capillary blood test , an antigen rapid diagnostic test 144 ( RDT ) from an oropharyngeal swab sample , and the completion of an online questionnaire . 145 We collected capillary blood on a Neoteryx Mitra® collection device , and tested for anti - 146 Spike - SARS - CoV - 2 IgG on a microfluidic nanoimmunoassay as described previously [ 15 ] . 147 We used the Panbio COVID - 19 Ag rapid test ( Abbott ) which has been validated in adults for 148 use with oropharyngeal instead of nasopharyngeal swabs [ 16 ] . 149 Then , a surveillance phase started , with weekly questionnaires and self - declarations ( anytime 150 outside of the weekly questionnaires ) allowing participants to report COVID - 19 - like 151 symptoms , contact with a positive case or the diagnosis of a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 152 An outbreak investigation was triggered when a positive case was diagnosed from a positive 153 real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) , and involved repeated 154 testing of the class and household members of the triggering case and of all participants who 155 subsequently tested positive . The date of diagnosis of the first positive case in a class was 156 referred to as Day 0 for that class . RDT and / or RT - PCR were performed at Day 0 - 2 and Day 157 5 - 7 . All oropharyngeal swab samples used for the RDT were tested a second time from the 158 same swab by RT - PCR to confirm the result ( in - house SARS - CoV - 2 RT - qPCR or Cobas® 159 SARS - CoV - 2 Test , Cobas 6800 , Roche , Switzerland ) . SARS - CoV - 2 whole genome 160 sequencing was performed for positive samples at the Health 2030 Genome Center ( Geneva ) 161 using the Illumina COVIDSeq library preparation reagents following the protocol provided by 162 the supplier . Serologies were performed at Day 0 - 2 and Day 30 . Positive cases ( or their 163 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

All parents and teachers were informed about the study and gave written consent 170 while children gave verbal consent to participate . 171 Study population 172 For this investigation , the study population consisted of all children and school staff in classes 173 with a positive case as well as household members of the confirmed cases . School staff 174 included teachers ( including assistants ) and non - teaching staff ( administrative , cleaners , 175 catering ) . Children absent from school for the 2 weeks preceding this outbreak were 176 considered as non - exposed and not included in the analysis . 177 Context and public health measures 178 Mitigation of the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic in Switzerland included school 179 closures during the first wave from March to May 2020 . Thereafter , priority was given to 180 keeping schools open with several types of preventive measures in place which varied widely 181 across institutions . In the investigated school , measures in place during the outbreak included 182 checking children’s temperature every morning , sending children home if they had fever or 183 sickness beyond very mild symptoms , restricted access for parents and requiring all adults to 184 wear facemasks . During the period of this outbreak investigation , non - pharmaceutical public 185 health measures in Geneva were gradually relaxed , with restaurants and bars opening their 186 outdoor spaces and entertainment venues opening their indoor spaces . 187 All rights reserved .

From April 12 , vaccination was opened to all persons aged 45 189 years or older , and to all people in the 16 - 44 age group from May 19 . 190 Definitions and analyses 191 Only descriptive analyses are presented here . Infection attack rates ( IAR ) were defined as the 192 proportion of all participating children and school staff with a positive RDT and / or RT - PCR , 193 and / or a seroconversion between D0 - 2 and D30 ( from seronegative to seropositive according 194 to the test - specific cut - off , unrelated to vaccination ) . Household secondary attack rates ( SAR ) 195 were defined as the proportion of household members who tested positive by RDT and / or RT - 196 PCR result or who seroconverted in households with one positive RDT and / or RT - PCR 197 participant enrolled in the study . Adults were defined as individuals ≥ 18 years , whereas 198 children were defined as individuals < 18 years of age . Plausible directions of transmission 199 were determined , when possible , on the basis of symptom onset and testing dates . 200 Results 201 Outbreak description and epidemiological and serological investigation 202 The first COVID - 19 case ( triggering case : Teacher 1 [ T1 ] , Class 1 ) was diagnosed by RT - 203 PCR on April 26 , 2021 , 3 days after the onset of symptoms . The second teacher in Class 1 204 ( T2 ) had symptoms onset on April 24 with an initially negative RT - PCR on April 26 followed 205 by a positive RT - PCR on April 28 ( Figure 1 ) . 206 All 21 children from Class 1 , aged 4 years old , were tested on April 27 , 2021 . The IAR was 207 62 % ( 13 / 21 ) : 1 child had a positive RDT confirmed by a RT - PCR ( Kid 1 [ K1 ] ) ; 5 children 208 had a negative RDT , but subsequent RT - PCR testing on the same swab samples came back 209 positive ( K2 , K3 , K8 , K11 , K12 ) ; 2 children absent from school because symptomatic were 210 tested by healthcare providers outside the study setting , both had a positive RT - PCR ( K4 , 211 All rights reserved .

Class 2 was therefore 216 tested on April 29 , 2021 . Of the 19 children aged 4 years old , 17 were tested by RT - PCR , of 217 whom 2 ( K6 , K7 ) tested positive ( IAR 11 . 8 % ) , and 2 did not participate in the outbreak 218 investigation ( they both had only a negative RT - PCR performed externally on May 6 ) . No 219 additional case was identified at subsequent visits . We also repeatedly tested 4 teachers and 2 220 non - teaching staff in contact with Classes 1 and 2 , none of whom was diagnosed with a 221 SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Table 1 ) . 222 Of note , these two classes were placed in quarantine by local health authorities for 10 days 223 from April 30 , 2021 . 224 The sibling of a positive case from Class 1 , attending Class 3 in the same school , tested 225 positive on May 2 ( K9 ) , triggering the testing protocol in Class 3 . All 17 6 - years old tested in 226 Class 3 had a negative RT - PCR on May 4 , and 16 / 16 had a negative RDT on May 11 227 ( subsequently confirmed with a RT - PCR ) . Serological tests at D30 revealed 2 additional 228 seroconversions ( K17 , K20 , one was not tested at D0 - 2 of the outbreak but seroconverted 229 since baseline at the end of March 2021 ) ( IAR 16 . 7 % ) . In the other class from the same grade , 230 Class 4 , tested because of close and regular contacts with Class 3 , 15 / 15 had a negative RT - 231 PCR on May 4 , 13 / 13 had a negative RDT on May 11 , and 2 additional cases of 232 seroconversion ( K18 , K19 ) were identified ( IAR 13 . 3 % ) ; 2 children in the class did not take 233 part in the study ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) . Among 3 teachers and 11 non - teaching staff , none tested 234 positive . Classes 3 and 4 were not placed in quarantine . 235 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Three members of the same household refused to participate in this investigation , 238 two of whom were vaccinated . Secondary attack rates were 1 / 3 ( 33 . 3 % ) with an adult index 239 case , and 2 / 26 ( 7 . 7 % ) with a child index case . A teacher spent a few days at his / her parents’ 240 place while having symptoms , his / her mother then developed symptoms and tested positive 241 ( adult household member [ HA17 ] ) . The parent ( HA5 ) of a positive child from Class 1 tested 242 negative twice ( RDT on May 1 , RT - PCR on May 7 ) , though he / she seroconverted ( Figure 1 , 243 Figure 2 ) . He / she reported no contacts outside his / her household , strictly followed all 244 recommendations , and was not vaccinated between the two blood draws . Finally , a parent 245 ( HA1 ) of two positive children from Classes 1 and 3 , who initially tested negative by RT - 246 PCR , tested positive after quarantine with his / her children . 247 Among the 15 cases with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test , 3 / 3 ( 100 % ) adults and 9 / 12 ( 69 % ) 248 children reported symptoms either before or after the positive test , and 3 children were 249 asymptomatic . Among the 8 children who seroconverted without a positive RDT or RT - PCR 250 test , 3 were symptomatic , 4 were asymptomatic , and one did not provide symptom 251 information . Overall , 12 / 19 ( 63 % ) infected children reported symptoms . No severe form of 252 COVID - 19 ( requiring hospitalization ) was reported , and all cases recovered well . 253 Contact tracing analysis 254 The two infected teachers live alone and reported no contact with a positive or symptomatic 255 case in their private life or activities , during the 14 days prior to infection . Their presumed 256 source of infection was school as several children from Class 1 were coughing during the 257 week of April 19 . The two infected parents were likely infected by their children , as they 258 reported no contact outside the household . 259 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

Coverage of three isolate genomes ( HA1 , K9 and K10 ) were 269 insufficient for any comparisons due to low viral load in the specimen ( 32 % , 20 % and 16 % 270 coverage only , respectively ) . The other sequenced genomes belonged to the Alpha variant in 271 the Pangolin nomenclature . The virus sequence of K12 differed from the others in the regions 272 covered . Here , in position 15824 - 15827 a deletion and one addition that restores the reading 273 frame was observed , resulting in a total of 4 nucleotides difference compared to the other 274 sequences . All 9 sequences with > 99 % coverage shared 100 % identity between genomes in 275 comparison to the reference sequence ( Figure 3 ) . Virus specimens that could only be partially 276 sequenced retrieved the same sequence without additional mutations in the regions covered . 277 Discussion 278 This is the first investigation of a SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak caused by the Alpha variant in a 279 primary school . It involved 20 children from 4 classes , 2 teachers and 3 household members . 280 The index case could not be formally identified , but it is likely that this outbreak started 281 during the week of April 19 and was only identified on April 26 when a teacher tested 282 positive and triggered the investigation .

This 284 prospective classroom - based study provides evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 circulation among 285 young children , school teachers , and introduction into households . 286 Since at least 9 positive cases of this outbreak shared viruses with identical sequence , we 287 conclude that they are part of the same cluster . This could have been either by simultaneous 288 infection through the same source , or transmission chains between affected individuals . One 289 divergent virus sequence was found in one of the positive children , which could be either a de 290 novo mutation occurring during the outbreak , or constitute independent introductions into the 291 school , with one leading to this cluster . It cannot be ruled out that , by coincidence , several 292 infection events with viruses sharing the same sequence were introduced from the community 293 independently into the school . However , this hypothesis seems less likely given the number of 294 cases involved , the epidemiological link and time frame , and the limited period of potentially 295 other exposures before the quarantine decision . Overall community circulation at the cantonal 296 level was also relatively low at the time ( weekly incidence : about 200 cases / 100 , 000 297 inhabitants ) . 298 Other main insights are as follows . First , viral circulation of the Alpha variant in young 299 children aged 4 - 6 years old was high , with a majority of unspecific and mild symptomatic 300 infections , which might explain relatively high secondary attack rates [ 13 ] . The observed 301 cluster probably started in one class and spread to two other classes , most likely through 302 direct child - to - child contacts and interactions as for our epidemiological investigation , 303 although there could be non - sampled child or adult intermediaries . We identified two 304 seroconversions in a fourth class , but with no identification of SARS - CoV - 2 virus , thereby 305 limiting the conclusions on transmission linked to the other classes . 306 Second , child - to - parent transmission occurred in two different households , and child - to - 307 teacher transmission is probable , which supports previous findings [ 18 , 19 ] .

Child - to - adult transmission seems to depend on the duration of 310 contacts , as no infection was identified among non - teaching staff who spent only limited 311 periods of time ( meals ) with children . This is contrary to previous findings [ 20 ] , and may be 312 explained by the young age of our participants and their behaviour involving physical 313 proximity with their teachers [ 21 ] . 314 Third , social activities outside the school could have contributed to the spread of the infection , 315 as previously reported [ 22 ] . However , they could also reflect the bonding between children 316 and a closer contact at school , thus facilitating transmission . 317 Fourth , we evidenced low sensitivity of RDTs with an oropharyngeal specimen for identifying 318 both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected children , which confirms previous results 319 showing that only children with high viral load are identified by such tests [ 23 , 24 ] . We 320 conclude that RDTs with an oropharyngeal specimen are not the most appropriate for 321 surveillance and / or outbreak investigation purposes . Analysis of joint RT - PCR / serological 322 data shows that there is a substantial under - detection of infections in young children , even 323 with RT - PCR testing , although the optimal time point for viral testing might have been 324 missed in the fixed testing scheme of this study . Under - detection of acutely infected children 325 might be an explanation for the discrepancy between official numbers of infected children 326 [ 25 ] , and studies on virus prevalence and seroprevalence in school settings [ 26 – 30 ] . 327 Strengths and limitations 328 Few large SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks in young children in school settings have been 329 documented so far [ 31 , 32 ] , even fewer involved an investigation of variants of concern . As 330 part of an ongoing prospective study , this investigation started less than 24 hours after the first 331 case was laboratory - confirmed and involved the use of three complementary approaches .

However , we relied on a limited number of cases . Not all children 335 and adults were tested , which could lead to underestimating IAR and SAR . We might have 336 missed infections among adults who were vaccinated between D0 - 2 and D30 , as we could not 337 distinguish between antibodies due to vaccination and those due to infection . Also , we could 338 not test the household members of cases only detected by seroconversion at D30 with no 339 positive RT - PCR / RDT , leading to a potential underestimation of secondary attack rates . The 340 study was performed before the circulation of the more infectious Delta variant ; estimates are 341 therefore likely to be underestimated in a context of Delta dominance [ 33 ] . 342 Conclusion 343 This prospective school - based study provides evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission among 344 young children and school teachers and introduction into households . Epidemiological 345 investigation confirmed child - to - child and child - to - adult direction of transmission of the 346 infection . Children may be a significant source of extra - household infections and have the 347 potential to play a role in community transmission , potentially even more so with the more 348 contagious Delta variant . With most of the adult and adolescent population vaccinated , 349 children could act as disease reservoirs . Effective strategies are needed to limit transmission 350 in school settings and vaccination of school staff , and children when available , should be 351 encouraged . 352 353 354 355 356 All rights reserved .
