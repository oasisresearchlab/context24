Cellular / Molecular Modulation of C . elegans Touch Sensitivity Is Integrated at Multiple Levels Xiaoyin Chen ( 陈筱寅 ) and Martin Chalfie Department of Biological Sciences , Columbia University , New York , New York 10027 Sensory systems can adapt to different environmental signals . Here we identify four conditions that modulate anterior touch sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans after several hours and demonstrate that such sensory modulation is integrated at multiple levels to produce a single output . Prolonged vibration involving integrin signaling directly sensitizes the touch receptor neurons ( TRNs ) . In contrast , hypoxia , the dauer state , and high salt reduce touch sensitivity by preventing the release of long - range neuroregulators , including two insulin - like proteins . Integration of these latter inputs occurs at upstream neurohormonal cells and at the insulin signaling cascade within the TRNs . These signals and those from integrin signaling converge to modulate touch sensitivity by regulating AKT kinases and DAF - 16 / FOXO . Thus , activation of either the integrin or insulin pathways can compensate for defects in the other pathway . This modu - latory system integrates conflicting signals from different modalities , and adapts touch sensitivity to both mechanical and non - mechanical conditions . Key words : insulin signaling ; integrin signaling ; long - term sensitization ; mechanosensation ; sensory modulation Introduction Various conditions modulate sensory perception and can change behavioral responses to sensory stimuli . The human sense of smell , forexample , isregulatedbymultiplehormonesthatreduce the olfactory attraction of food when individuals are not hungry ( Palouzier - Paulignan et al . , 2012 ) . In addition the response of songbirds to songs depends on estradiol levels , which fluctuate seasonally ( Maney and Pinaud , 2011 ) , and gustatory chemosen - sationinthenematode Caenorhabditiselegans isenhancedduring hypoxic conditions because additional neurons are recruited into the circuit ( Pocock and Hobert , 2010 ) . Sensory modulation can occur through direct synaptic connections ( Fex , 1967 ) , long - range neuropeptides ( Palouzier - Paulignan et al . , 2012 ) , and hor - mones ( Maney and Pinaud , 2011 ; Palouzier - Paulignan et al . , 2012 ) . Sensory cells can also self - modulate , e . g . , the dynamic range of mammalian cone and rod cells changes in response to overall brightness ( Fain et al . , 2001 ) . Mechanosensation , in particular , can be modulated in multi - pleways . Bothhearingandtouchsensitivityhabituatetorepeated stimuli ( Pinsker et al . , 1970 ; Weber , 1970 ) , and touch sensitivity sensitizes when it is paired with a second obnoxious stimulus ( Pinsker et al . , 1973 ) . Both mechanosensory habituation and sensitization have been attributed to synaptic plasticity . A less studied form of sensitization , produced by sustained normal stimulation , affects mammalian hearing and touch ( Kujawa and Liberman , 1999 ; Govindaraju et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , visual and auditory inputs can modify mechanosensory per - ception in humans ( Ho¨tting et al . , 2003 ; Longo et al . , 2011 ) and motor function modulates the sensation of stretch in crus - taceans ( Sillar and Skorupski , 1986 ) . How multiple and con - flicting signals integrate to modulate mechanosensation , however , is unclear . In C . elegans , gentle touch is sensed by six touch receptor neurons ( TRNs ) , which detect changes in applied force and adapt quickly to constant pressure ( O’Hagan et al . , 2005 ) . Transduc - tion occurs through the MEC - 4 DEG / ENaC channel complex ( O’Hagan et al . , 2005 ) . The TRN touch response habituates to repeated stimuli given over several minutes and sensitizes for a short time ( (cid:2) 2 min ) following a single strong stimulus ( Rankin et al . , 1990 ) . In this paper , we show that C . elegans mechanosensation is sensitized by sustained vibration or tapping and reduced under several stress conditions ( high salt , low oxygen , or the dauer state ) . Unlike previously reported habituation and short - term sensitization ( Rankin et al . , 1990 ) , however , the changes we report here occur on a longer timescale ( hours rather than minutes ) and only affect the anterior TRNs . These conditions signal through three different sets of neurons and two molec - ular pathways and integrate at multiple points along these pathways . We further demonstrate the behavioral and adap - tive consequences of such modulation . ReceivedJan . 3 , 2014 ; revisedMarch11 , 2014 ; acceptedMarch31 , 2014 . Authorcontributions : X . C . andM .

C . elegans strains ( Table 1 ) were maintained at 15°C or 20°C as described previously ( Brenner , 1974 ) . Hermaphrodites were used for all experiments . Temperature - sensitive strains were main - tained at 15°C and transferred to 25°C for one generation before testing . Most of the strains came from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center , whichisfundedbyNIHOfficeofResearchInfrastructurePrograms ( P40 OD010440 ) . pat - 2 ( ok2148 ) III , unc - 112 ( gk1 ) V , akt - 1 ( ok525 ) V , and akt - 2 ( ok393 ) X were generated by the International C . elegans Gene Knock - out Consortium ( http : / / www . celeganskoconsortium . omrf . org ) . To study the importance of insulin - like peptides , we examined the effects of mutant alleles for all ins genes except for ins - 19 , ins - 20 , ins - 21 , ins - 24 , ins - 32 , ins - 36 , and ins - 39 , which we tested using feeding RNAi . Becausetheputativedeletionallele , ins - 10 ( tm3498 ) , produceddetectable ins - 10 mRNA ( J . Alcedo , personal communication ; data not shown ) , we used animals carrying a construct expressing an ins - 10 hairpin from the ins - 10 promoter to induce RNAi against ins - 10 [ ins - 10 ( i ) ] . The hypoxic treatment was performed as described previously ( Po - cock and Hobert , 2010 ) . Dauers were obtained by growing mixed - stage animals at 25°C until they depleted the bacteria on the plate ( usually after one generation ) and thenfurtherstarvedfor5d . Thedaueranimalsweretheneithertestedfor touch sensitivity directly , or separated from non - dauer animals by 1 % SDS treatment for 30 min for the chemotaxis assay . Because dauers were obtainedbystarvation , allassaysinvolvingthemusedstarvedL3larvaeas controls . For high - salt treatments , the animals were grown for one generation on NGM plates ( Brenner , 1974 ) supplemented with an additional 180 m M NaCl to produce a final NaCl concentration of 230 m M . For amiloridetreatment , bus - 17 animals , whicharemorepermeabletodrugs asadults ( Gravato - Nobreetal . , 2005 ; Bounoutasetal . , 2009 ) , weretrans - ferred to 230 m M NaCl plates supplemented with 2 m M amiloride hydro - chloride hydrate ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for at least 2 h , vibrated for 2 h , and recovered for 1 h on 230 m M NaCl plates without amiloride before test - ing . For channelrhodopsin - 2 activation during culture , TU3851 animals were grown on 230 m M NaCl plates supplemented with 500 (cid:2) M all trans - retinal ( Sigma - Aldrich ) until the L4 stage , wrapped in aluminum foil , and illuminated by an LXML - PB01 – 0040 Luxeon Rebel 470 nm LED ( Philips Lighting ) at 3 . 4 V and 700 mA continuously for 2 h , then rested for 30 – 40 min before testing . For all vibrations , we played . wav files containing the appropriate waveforms through 3 . 5” ( for culture ) or 5 . 25” ( for observation ) dual cone speakers amplified by a digital amplifier . The outer cone of the speakerwasremoved , leavingonlytheinnerconeasastandfortheplates . Alidofa3 . 5cmPetridish ( BDFalcon351008 ) wasgluedtothetopofthe cone facing up , and the bottom of the dish was glued to a test plate , also facing up . The test plate was then put on the speaker by fitting the dish bottom to the lid , which produced enough friction to hold the plate in place . The . wav files were written with MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . The average acceleration of the vibration was quantified using a DE - ACCM6G accelerometer ( Dimension Engineering ) on top of the plates . To observe the plates under vibration , we illuminated the plates on one side from underneath and recorded at a resolution of 1920 (cid:4) 1080 with a Canon EOS 60D camera ( Canon USA ) with an Olympus OM 50 mm f / 2 Macro lens ( Olympus Imaging America ) . For prolonged vibration , the animals were vibrated with 50 Hz square waves for 24 h with an average acceleration of 1 . 5 (cid:4) g , and recovered from habituation for 30 – 40 min before testing except for calcium imag - ingexperimentsandthehabituationrecoveryassay , inwhichtheanimals were tested after resting for times indicated in the following sections .

The full list of primers and plasmids used is available upon request . Most constructs were made using the three - fragment Gateway sys - tem ( Life Technologies ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using the pDONRP4 - P1r , pDONR221 , pDONRP2r - P3 , and pDESTR4 - R3 vec - tors unless noted otherwise . Behavioral assays . All behavioral assays were performed blind with regard to genotype . At least three biologically independent tests were performed for each strain . For mosaic analyses and laser ablations , the average and SEM of the response of animals were reported . For vibration - induced behaviors , the number of animals from independent tests were summed together and reported . For all other tests , the average and SEM of the means from the independent tests were reported . The touch response was assayed by gently touching the side of the animal ( see below for validations ) . Each animal was tested five times anteriorly and five times posteriorly unless noted ( Hobert et al . , 1999 ) . Ten to 20 animals were tested each time , and each strain was tested at least three times independently . Totestactivationbychannelrhodopsin - 2 ( Nageletal . , 2005 ) , bleached eggs were put on plates seeded with 100 (cid:2) l Escherichia coli OP50 in LB brothatthestationaryphase ( OD 595 (cid:5) 0 . 45 ; Brenner , 1974 ) with500 (cid:2) M all trans - retinal ( Sigma - Aldrich ) .

We then exposed each worm to a (cid:6) 0 . 5 s flash of blue light coming from the GFP filter under a 20 (cid:4) f (cid:5) 0 . 6 objective and 12 (cid:4) zoom aimed at the ALM cell body . A fast backward movement within the 0 . 5 s exposure was counted as a positive response . Eachanimalwastestedthreetimesinsteadoffivetimesbecause considerable habituation occurs after three tests ( Nagel et al . , 2005 ) . The vibration response assays ( Fig . 10 A ) were performed using 50 Hz , 0 . 5 s squarepulseswithanaverageplateaccelerationof1 . 7 (cid:4) g . Eachplatewas tested twice with at least 10 min in between , and the data from indepen - dent plates were pooled for analysis . To test the response to nonlocalized vibration , animals were stimu - lated with a 0 . 5 s 0 dB 50 Hz square wave pulse vibration reaching an average acceleration of 1 . 7 (cid:4) g . We videotaped the experiments and then counted the number of animals that backed within 0 . 5 s of the stimulus on the video and measured the turning angle of the animals that backed . The animals that did not back were given a turning angle of 0° and the average turning angle was calculated for all animals . To test touch sensitivity during background vibration ( Fig . 10 D ) , we inserted a 0 . 5 s , 0 dB 50 Hz square wave pulse in a background of (cid:7) 4 dB 50 Hz square wave vibration , reaching average accelerations of 1 . 7 and 0 . 7 (cid:4) g in the plates , respectively . We videotaped the animals and counted the number of animals that backed within 0 . 5 s of the stimulus on the videos . To test recovery from habituation ( Fig . 10 E , F ) , we tested animals at various times after cessation of vibration with a sustained 50 Hz square wave with an average acceleration of 1 (cid:4) g . Responses of animals were pooled from multiple plates . The chemotaxis assay with tapping was performed using a mechanical tapper driven by a magnetic relay as described previously ( Rankin et al . , 1990 ) . Animals were then allowed to move toward a spot of diacetyl for a fixed amount of time . The ratio of the chemotaxis efficiency index ( CEI ; percentage of animals that had reached the spot ) with or without tapping was then calculated , and the means and SEMs of the ratios were reported . Touch test validation . Originally , the touch assay was done by stroking a thin hair ( eyebrow hair ) across the animal ( Chalfie and Sulston , 1981 ) . However , by only touching the side of the animal , we were able to detect more subtle changes in touch sensitivity . For akt - 1 ( ok525 ) animals , five anteriortouchesproducedonaverage4 . 4 (cid:8) 0 . 2responses ( mean (cid:8) SEM of responses of individual animals , n (cid:5) 20 ) by stroking a thin hair across the animal , and 1 . 7 (cid:8) 0 . 2 ( n (cid:5) 19 ) by touching the side of the animal . Both methods produced similar scores for wild - type animals ( 4 . 9 (cid:8) 0 . 1 for the original method and 4 . 6 (cid:8) 0 . 1 for side touch , n (cid:5) 16 and n (cid:5) 18 , respectively ) . Feeding RNAi . Feeding RNAi was performed as described previously ( Calixto et al . , 2010 ) . All RNAi bacteria used were from the Ahringer library ( Source Bioscience ) except for ins - 20 and ins - 36 , which were made in L4440 as described . Except for the feeding RNAi screen , we examined at least three independent plates at the same time . For the feeding RNAi screen , we scored genes that caused touch insen - sitivityinthreeoffourtestsaspositive . Asacontrolweincludedtheseven dense body genes found in our initial study ( Calixto et al . , 2010 ) in our list of 87 candidate genes , and we were able to identify six of them blindly ( the remaining gene , pat - 3 , produced lethality in TU3595 ) . RNAi for 23 oftheremaining80genesreducedtouchinsensitivity ( Table2 ) . Basedon known functions or homology , the 23 genes included additional focal adhesion genes , genes in the Ras / MAPK pathway , insulin signaling path - way , Rho - GTPase - related genes , and cytoskeleton related genes . unc - 73 , which encodes a guanine exchange factor for several Rho - GTPases , and mec - 12 , which is a secondary target for tba - 1 RNAi , were previously reported to affect TRN functions and / or development ( Hedgecock et al . , 1987 ; Chalfie and Thomson , 1982 ) . For a single test , we estimated the false positive rate to be (cid:6) 20 % from a larger screen for (cid:2) 1000 genes . Therefore , the false positive rate of the screen was estimated to be C 41 (cid:3) 0 . 2 3 (cid:3) 0 . 8 (cid:4) 0 . 2 4 (cid:5) 2 . 7 % , corre - sponding to 2 . 7 % (cid:4) 80 (cid:5) 2 false positives out of the 23 genes obtained from the screen ( 7 genes from the list of 87 genes did not have RNAi bacteria , and were not tested ) . Subsequent tests of all identified insulin and Ras / MAPK pathway genes using mutant alleles identified cav - 1 and daf - 18 as false positives in these two pathways . Mosaic analysis . All tests on focal adhesion mutants were done on mosaic animals , except for RNAi treatments as indicated .

ChenandChalfie • MechanosensoryModulationin C . elegans J . Neurosci . , May7 , 2014 • 34 ( 19 ) : 6522 – 6536 • 6525 AVMcells , thetwoPLMcells , orhavingRFPin all six TRNs ( controls ) were selected and scored blindly for both anterior and posterior touch sensitivity . The anterior touch response of animals that had lost the rescuing array in the anterior TRNs and the posterior touch re - sponse of animals that had lost the rescuing array in the posterior TRNs were compared with both the anterior and posterior touch re - sponse of the controls . For calcium imaging experiments , the absence of RFP in the ALM cells was additionally confirmed under a 40 (cid:4) 0 . 95 lens . For all experiments involving mosaic animals , at least two independent tests were done with the data pooled for analysis . Laser ablations . Laser ablations were per - formed as described previously ( Tsalik and Hobert , 2003 ) . The M4 and I5 cells were la - beled with GFP and ablated in L4 larvae . All animals were anesthetized with 30 m M sodium azide . Control animals were left in sodium azide on a slide for the same time as ablated animals , and mock - ablated animals had adja - cent pharyngeal neurons ablated instead of M4 and I5 . After 24 h , the ablation was confirmed by the lack of GFP recovery in the M4 and I5 cells . The confirmed animals were then tested for touch sensitivity in blind tests . Ablating the M4 neuron prevented feeding , so the ablated animals were compared with mock ablated an - imals that were starved for 24 h . Calcium imaging . Calcium imaging was per - formed as described previously ( Suzuki et al . , 2003 ) using GCaMP3 with minor modifica - tions on a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope with a Photometrics Evolve 512 camera ( Photomet - rics ) . Each animal was glued on its ventral sur - face using Dermabond ( Ethicon ) to a 4 % agarose pad in M9 buffer on a 24 (cid:4) 60 mm No . 1 coverslip and covered with 100 (cid:2) l M9 buffer . We mounted the coverslip on a rotating stage on a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope equipped with an Eppendorf TransferMan NK2 micro - manipulator ( Eppendorf North America ) . A glass probe with a round tip with a diameter of 22 (cid:2) m driven by a two - layer piezoelectric rect - angular bending actuator ( Piezo Systems ) was mounted on the micromanipulator , and care - fullyplacednexttotheanimalwithoutpressingitandparalleltotheanimal . The piezo lever was driven by 250 ms square waves from a 33221Awaveformgenerator ( AgilentTechnol - ogies ) through a Piezo Linear Amplifier ( Piezo Systems ) . The square waves cause the probe to bend sideways in the x – y plane , thus pressing the animal . During the recording , we illumi - nated the animal with a 470 nm LED from Co - libri2 ( CarlZeissMicroscopy ) at10 % intensity through a GFP filter cube , and recorded the images through a Zeiss Apochromat 40 (cid:4) 0 . 95 lens with a Photometrics Evolve 512 camera at (cid:2) 10 fps and analyzed with AxioVision ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy ) . Only late L4 larvae or young adult animals were used for calcium imaging in the TRNs , although L3 larvae had similar touch sensitivity and calcium response ( data not shown ) . In a typical experiment , we touchedananimalwithapiezoprobeandvariedthestimulusbyincreas - ing the voltage from 0 . 01 to 1 . 6 V , once or twice at each voltage , and recorded the calcium signal . Each stimulus was given when calcium re - sponse had reached the baseline or had plateaued . The timing between two stimuli could thus be different , but such timing differences did not change the response over the small number of trials in each experiment ( data not shown ) . Calcium responses ( after background subtraction ) at different displacements were normalized to the maximum calcium re - sponse for each animal . All calcium responses from multiple animals of the same genotype and treatment were then pooled together and fitted R e l a t i v e A c t i v a t i on E Control Vibration Displacement ( µm ) Recovery 0 1 2 500 600 700 0 25 50 75 100 0 1 2 1200 1400 1600 0 50 100 150 200 G D i s p l a c e m en t ( µ m ) D i s p l a c e m en t ( µ m ) G C a M P 3 ( au ) Control Vibration Time ( s ) G C a M P 3 ( au ) D 50 ( µm ) k n ALM 1 . 1±0 . 1 26 ALM ( vib ) 0 . 6±0 . 2 7 ALM ( recovery ) 1 . 5±0 . 3 6 PLM 2 . 1±0 . 2 11 PLM ( vib ) 2 . 2±0 . 3 6 F 0 200 400 AVA AVD M a x F H 0 1000 2000 3000 AVA AVD F 0 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 AVA AVD D 10 ( µ m ) I J CV CV CV CV CV CV K 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 AVA AVD F l uo r e sc en c e ( au ) CV CV 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 T ou c h r e s pon s e Vibration time ( hrs ) Posterior Anterior * * * * * * * * * 24 A C 0 1 2 3 4 5 - 20 50 200 A n t e r i o r R e s pon s e * * * * * * Frequency ( Hz ) B A n t e r i o r R e s pon s e 0 1 2 3 4 5 - 1 2 3 * * * * * * Time ( hr ) A n t e r i o r R e s pon s e 0 1 2 3 4 5 - 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 D * * * * * * Force ( g ) 3 . 3±0 . 3 4 . 3±1 . 7 3 . 2±0 . 7 1 . 9±0 . 5 1 . 3±0 . 2 Figure 1 .

Additionally , calcium responses from the same animal were fitted with a Boltzmann equation to calculate D 50 , the slope factor k , and max - imum calcium response for each animal tested , and their means and SEMs were used for evaluating statistical significance of the changes in D 50 , k , and maximum calcium response across different strains . The D 50 and k obtained by fitting all data points for a particular strain showed only small discrepancies from the mean D 50 and k calculated from indi - vidual animals and falls within 1 SEM from the mean D 50 and k values . Calcium imaging in the interneurons was performed similarly except that only adult animals were used . Animals were stimulated every 20 s once a response was observed to minimize the effect of habituation . Each animal was tested once at each voltage because of stronger habituation than the signals in the TRNs . The actual displacement of the probe at a particular voltage was measured using DIC images from multiple ani - mals that were acquired after the calcium recordings were finished . The displacementsoftheprobewereessentiallyidentical ( within10 % ) across individual animals and genotypes . Calcium imaging of TRNs cultured on coverslips ( Topalidou and Chalfie , 2011 ) was performed according to Suzuki et al . ( 2003 ) . pat - 2 or unc - 112 ALM cells were selected by finding GCaMP3 - positive and RFP - negative cells with one long process only . ALM cells from other strains were selected by finding GCaMP3 - positive cells with one long process only . Potassium depolarization was performed according to Suzuki et al . ( 2003 ) : cells were perfused using an extracellular saline ( 145 m M NaCl , 5 m M KCl , 2m M CaCl 2 , 1m M MgCl 2 , 10m M HEPES , and10m MD - glucose , pH 7 . 2 , and adjusted to 340 mOsm with sucrose ) and depolarized with extracellular saline with 110 m M KCl and 40 m M NaCl . The maximum calcium change within five seconds from the initiation of the response was measured . Scoring of TRN morphological defects . A TRN process was scored as ensheathment defective if it was close to the muscle in adults for more thanhalfitslengthwhenexaminedunder20 (cid:4) magnification . ForRNAi - treated animals ( Fig . 3 F ) , an ALM process was scored as attachment defective if the ALM cell body was squeezed into a half - circle shape ( an indication of its adjacency to muscle ) instead of the normal raindrop shape . We scored an ALM cell as migration defective when the cell body was anterior either to the mid - point between terminal bulb of the phar - ynxandthevulva , ortotheAVMcellbody . P valueswerecalculatedusing Fisher’s exact test . Imaging and single - molecule mRNA FISH . All images were taken on a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope with a Photometrics CoolSnap HQ 2 cam - era . We performed single - molecule mRNA FISH as described previously ( Topalidou et al . , 2011 ) . The numbers of transcripts per cell were counted manually . Three independent tests were performed and the re - sults were pooled . Statistics . Results from touch assays , channelrhodopsin - 2 assays , and antibody staining were compared using Student’s t test . Categorical data from vibration assays , attachment defects , and migration defects were compared using Fisher’s exact test . smFISH data were compared us - ing Mann – Whitney’s U test . All p values reported are after Bonferroni corrections . Results Multiple conditions alter touch sensitivity The response to gentle touch in C . elegans habituates with re - peated stimuli ( Chalfie and Sulston , 1981 ; Rankin et al . , 1990 ) . We induced habituation by placing plates of animals on speakers producing a 50 Hz vibration ( 1 . 5 (cid:4) g average acceleration ) , sub - jecting them to varying periods of stimulation , and testing their touch sensitivity 5 min after the end of stimulation . The anterior and posterior responses habituated with different time courses ( Fig . 1 A ) . Vibration caused posterior touch sensitivity to be in - creasingly lost over 24 h . In contrast , although animals lost touch sensitivity to anterior touch if stimulated for less than 2 h , they were sensitized back to nearly wild - type levels after 2 h ( Fig . 1 A ) . Longer period of vibration did not further increase touch sensi - tivity . A similar increase in posterior touch sensitivity after habit - uation was not seen ( Fig . 1 A ) . The greatest sensitization occurred whenanimalswerevibratedformorethan2hatafrequencyof50Hzandwithaverageacceleration (cid:8) 1 (cid:4) g ( Fig . 1 B – D ) . We further substantiated these findings using GCaMP3 imaging : vibration re - versiblyreducedthedisplacementrequiredfor50 % activation ( D 50 ) in the ALM neurons ( p (cid:6) 0 . 02 ) , but not in the PLM neurons ( Fig . 1 E , F ) . In addition , ALM neurons of treated animals produced spontaneouscalciumspikeswithoutamechanicalstimulus ; nosuch spikeswereobservedinuntreatedanimals ( Fig . 1 G ) . Theappearance of the spikes suggests that the vibrated animals detected either back - ground vibrations from the microscope stage or stimuli induced by the contraction of body wall muscles . Thus , prolonged vibration specifically increased the touch sensitivity of ALM neurons and counteracted habituation to maintain a normal response . In addition to increased sensitivity of the TRNs , the sensitized behavioral response could also be caused by changes in the down - stream circuits . The anterior ALM neurons synapse onto the AVD interneurons neurons , which synapse onto the AVA in - terneurons ; these interneurons drive backward movement Time ( mins ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 60 120 180 A n t e r i o r r e s pon s e B * * * * * * * * * * NaCl ( mM ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 100 200 300 A n t e r i o r r e s pon s e 380 mM Sucrose C * * 0 1 2 3 4 5 - N a C l K C l NH 4 C l N a A c NH 4 A c S u c r o s e A n t e r i o r r e s pon s e D NH 4 C l NH 4 A c * * * * * * * 0 1 2 3 4 5 - - v i b t ap C h R 2 - v i b h y p - v i b A A n t e r i o r r e s pon s e * * * * * * * NaCl + Amil NaCl * * * * * * * * * * * dauer Figure2 .

ChenandChalfie • MechanosensoryModulationin C . elegans J . Neurosci . , May7 , 2014 • 34 ( 19 ) : 6522 – 6536 • 6527 ( Chalfie et al . , 1985 ) . Calcium imaging in these cells revealed a similar reduction in the displacement needed to reproducibly elicit a calcium response as in ALM neu - rons , and no increase in the maximum amplitude of calcium response by satu - rated stimulation except for a reduced baseline level in the AVA cells following sustained vibration ( Fig . 1 H – K ) . Thus , synaptic changes are unlikely to contrib - ute to sensitization . In contrast to the stimulating effect of prolonged vibration , several stress condi - tions reduced the anterior touch response ( Fig . 2 A ) . Wild - type animals grown on high salt ( 230 m M NaCl , but not 380 m M sucrose (cid:3) 50 m M NaCl ; Fig . 2 B – D ) or un - der hypoxic conditions ( 1 % O 2 ) or ani - mals that had developed into dauer larvae had reduced anterior touch sensitivity ( Fig . 2 A ) . The touch insensitivity , how - ever , was restored when the animals were subjected to several hours of sustained vibration or repeated tapping ( 1 Hz ; Fig . 2 A ) . To test if activation of the MEC - 4 mechanotransduction channel was needed for sensitization by vibra - tion , we blocked the activation of MEC - 4 mechanotransduction channels by treating bus - 17 animals with amiloride during prolonged vibration and tested the animals after recovery from amiloride ( the amiloride treatment effectively re - duced anterior touch sensitivity of bus - 17 animals from wild - type level to 0 . 3 (cid:8) 0 . 1 responses out of five touches , N (cid:5) 3 ) . Pro - longed vibration in the presence of amiloride restored touch sensitivity ( Fig . 2 A ) , indicating that activation of the MEC - 4 channel is not required for sensi - tization . In addition sensitization was not induced by continuous activation of the TRNs through channelrhodopsin - 2 ( Na - gel et al . , 2005 ; Fig . 2 A ) , suggesting that activation of the TRNs without mechani - cal stimulation is not sufficient to induce sensitization . These data suggest that vibration - induced sensitization requires a different force sensor . Integrin signaling modulates mechanical sensitivity Integrins and focal adhesion proteins sense cellular stretching forces and induce long - term cellular changes ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2012 ) . Even though the focal adhesion proteins are expressed in mechanosensory cells , including the TRNs and vertebrate hair cells ( Fig . 3 A ) , they are unlikely to mediate the rapid , submillisecond mechanosen - sory transduction seen in neurons ( Chalfie , 2009 ) because integrin - mediated mechanosensation is usually slow ( tens of seconds ; Vogel and Sheetz , 2009 ) . Nonetheless , a role of these proteins in mechanosensation is suggested by the loss of touch sensitivity that occurs when focal adhesion proteins are reduced using cell - specific RNAi or partial loss - of - function mutations ( Hobert et al . , 1999 ; Calixto et al . , 2010 ) . We wondered , however , whether the focal adhesion proteins contributed to force sensing for sensitization . To circumvent the embryonic lethality associated with the complete loss of the focal adhesion genes , we tested touch sensi - tivity in animals that were mosaic for null alleles ( Fig . 3 B ) .

( Loss of these genes in the posterior TRNs , the two PLM neurons , did not reduce touch sensitivity . ) The partial loss of anterior sensitivity was not caused by general cellular dysfunction or changes in downstream circuits , because ALM neurons expressing channelrhodopsin - 2 ( Nagel et al . , 2005 ) and containing or lacking the rescuing arrays of the focal adhesion genes were equally capable of inducing backing when activated by blue light ( Fig . 3 C ) . In contrast , animals with reduced activity of the L - type voltage - gated calcium channel EGL - 19 re - sponded less to blue light activation of channelrhodopsin - 2 . These data indicate that the focal adhesion proteins do not disrupt the channelrhodopsin - 2 response and are likely to affect an early stage of mechanosensation . The TRNs lacking rescuing arrays had normal morphology except for minor migration defects seen in ALM cells lacking pat - 3 and the failure of the ALM and PLM processes to separate from the muscle that normally occurs after the TRN processes are ensheathed by the surrounding hypodermis in adults ( Fig . 3 D , E ; Gettner et al . , 1995 ) . A similar role for integrins in the anchoring of neuronal processes to epidermal cells occurs in Drosophila ( Kim et al . , 2012 ) . These defects , however , cannot solely account for the reduced touch sensitivity ( Fig . 3 F ) . Focal adhesion proteins did , however , modulate the sensitiv - ity of the ALM neurons as measured by an increase in D 50 in pat - 2 ( 2 . 6 (cid:8) 0 . 2 (cid:2) m , mean (cid:8) SEM , n (cid:5) 11 , p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 , k (cid:5) 1 . 2 (cid:8) 0 . 1 ) and unc - 112 mutants ( 1 . 7 (cid:8) 0 . 2 (cid:2) m , n (cid:5) 6 , p (cid:6) 0 . 005 , k (cid:5) 1 . 6 (cid:8) 0 . 1 ) compared with wild - type animals ( 1 . 1 (cid:8) 0 . 1 (cid:2) m , n (cid:5) 26 , k (cid:5) 3 . 3 (cid:8) 0 . 3 ; Fig . 4 A ) . Loss of pat - 2 , but not unc - 112 , also reduced maximum calcium response both in vivo and in cultured cells depolarized by high potassium ( Fig . 4 B , C ) , suggesting an addi - tional role in regulating calcium influx . Integrins mediate vibration - induced sensitization through AKT and FOXO Using neuron - enhanced feeding RNAi , we screened conserved signaling genes whose products may interact with or affect integ - rin signaling ( Zaidel - Bar , 2009 ) and found that insulin signaling and several other signaling pathways were required for optimal touch sensitivity ( Table 2 ) . Insulin signaling prevents dauer for - mation in C . elegans through the successive activation of the DAF - 2 / insulin receptor , the AGE - 1 / PI3 kinase , the PDK - 1 / 3 - phosphoinositide - dependent kinase , and the redundantly acting AKT - 1 and AKT - 2 / AKT , which inhibit the activity of the DAF - 16 / FOXO transcription factor ( Hu , 2007 ) . Mutations in daf - 2 , age - 1 , pdk - 1 , and akt - 1 reduced anterior touch sensitivity ( Fig . 5 A ) . Both akt - 1 and akt - 2 are expressed in the TRNs ( Fig . 5 B ) . Loss of akt - 2 , however , did not produce touch insensitivity by itself , but further reduced anterior touch sensitivity of akt - 1 mu - tant ( from 2 . 5 (cid:8) 0 . 1 responses to 0 . 7 (cid:8) 0 . 2 responses , N (cid:8) 3 , p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) , suggesting that akt - 2 plays a minor role in regulating touch sensitivity . None of these mutations affected posterior touch sensitivity except for the daf - 2 ( m65 ) - null mutation ( other temperature - sensitive daf - 2 mutations , including e979 , m41 , and sa193 , which produce similar dauer formation and lifespan phe - notypes as m65 , only reduced anterior touch sensitivity ; Fig . 5 C ) . As expected from the known pathway , the touch insensitivity of daf - 2 animals was suppressed by the loss of daf - 16 ( Fig . 5 D ) or a gain - of - function mutation in pdk - 1 [ mg142 ; pdk - 1 ( gf ) ] ( from 0 . 9 (cid:8) 0 . 2 responses to 4 . 1 (cid:8) 0 . 1 , N (cid:8) 4 , p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) . Moreover TRN - specific expression of akt - 1 ( (cid:3) ) restored the anterior touch sensitivity of akt - 1 animals ( from 2 . 6 (cid:8) 0 . 3 responses to 4 . 0 (cid:8) 0 . 3 responses , N (cid:8) 3 , p (cid:6) 0 . 0001 ) , indicating that the pathway was active in the TRNs . Focal adhesion complexes phosphorylate and activate AKT kinases in mammalian cells ( Persad et al . , 2001 ) . To test if integ - rin signaling modulates C . elegans touch sensitivity through AKT - 1 , we overexpressed focal adhesion genes in the TRNs in pdk - 1 and akt - 1 mutants . Overexpressing unc - 112 and pat - 6 in the TRNs of daf - 2 ( m65 ) , pdk - 1 ( sa680 ) , but not akt - 1 ( ok525 ) an - imals restored their touch sensitivity ( Fig . 6 A ) . Increasing insulin signaling by akt - 1 ( mg144 ) , pdk - 1 ( mg142 ) , or daf - 16 ( mgDf50 ) re - stored the anterior touch sensitivity of unc - 112 and pat - 2 mosaic animals ( Fig . 6 B ) . These data indicate that insulin and integrin signaling converge on AKT - 1 to modulate touch sensitivity and compensate for each other . The focal adhesion proteins are un - likely to act downstream of insulin signaling , as suggested by quantitative PCR results of Suzuki and Han ( 2006 ) , because sin - gle molecule mRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization ( smFISH ) revealed no change in the number of unc - 112 transcripts in daf - 2 ( e1370 ) animals ( data not shown ) . Sustained vibration restored anterior touch sensitivity to daf - 2 and pdk - 1 animals , but not to unc - 112 , pat - 2 or akt - 1 mu - tants ( Fig . 6 C ) , indicating that vibration compensates for loss of insulin signaling through the focal adhesion proteins and AKT - 1 , but not PDK - 1 . Calcium imaging confirms that vibration did not change the sensitivity of ALM neurons lacking pat - 2 ( Fig . 4 A ) . Because focal adhesions are implicated in sensing force , these data suggest that the focal adhesions act as secondary mechano - B 0 10 20 30 40 + pat - 2 unc - 112 egl - 19 M a x F / F 0 ( % ) * * 0 1 2 unc - 112 pat - 2 egl - 19 F / F 0 C * * + 0 0 . 5 1 0 2 4 6 R e l a t i v e A c t i v a t i on Displacement ( µm ) WT pat - 2 unc - 112 egl - 19 pat - 2 ( vib ) A Figure4 .

Neurosci . , May7 , 2014 • 34 ( 19 ) : 6522 – 6536 • 6529 sensors in the ALM neurons , although we cannot rule out that they act immediately downstream of the receptor . If integrins act as secondary mechano - sensors , they must bind to ECM compo - nents so external force can be transmitted through the hypodermis to the TRNs ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2012 ) . him - 4 mu - tantanimalslackmostoftheECMaroundtheTRNprocessesandtheattachmentbe - tween the processes and the hypodermis ( Vogel and Hedgecock , 2001 ) , and should prevent integrin activation . Although him - 4 animals respond to touch ( Vogel and Hedgecock , 2001 ) , using our modi - fied touch test ( see Materials and Meth - ods ) , we detected a reduction in touch sensitivity ( Fig . 6 C , D ) . Anterior sensitiv - ity was restored to him - 4 animals by ex - pression of the gain - of - function pdk - 1 allele in the TRNs ( Fig . 6 D ) , but not by sustained vibration ( Fig . 6 C ) , suggesting that integrin signaling cannot be activated by external force without the ECM and / or attachment to the hypodermis . Hypoxia and the dauer state regulate TRN touch sensitivity through the reduction in INS - 10 TRNs are unlikely to sense hypoxia , high salt , or the dauer state directly . These con - ditions must be sensed by other neurons that then signal to the TRNs . Because in - sulin signaling alters the anterior touch response , we tested the effect on touch sensitivity of the loss of the 40 genes en - coding insulin - like peptides ( Pierce et al . , 2001 ) using mutants with loss - of - function alleles or RNAi - treated animals . Mutation or reduction of ins - 10 and ins - 22 caused anterior touch insensitivity ( a third gene , ins - 33 , may affect TRN de - velopment ; Fig . 7 A ) . INS - 10 modulates anterior touch sen - sitivity through its release from two pha - ryngeal neurons : the M4 motor neuron and the I5 interneuron ( Fig . 7 B ) . Laser ab - lation of both the M4 and I5 neurons in late L4 stage animals resulted in adults whose anterior touch sensitivity mim - icked the loss of ins - 10 within 24 h of ab - lation ( Fig . 7 C ) , but whose posterior touch sensitivity did not change ( data not shown ) . Ablation of either cell alone re - sulted in little or no reduction of anterior touch sensitivity compared with controls . Because neither M4 nor I5 connects syn - aptically to the TRNs or their downstream interneurons ( Albertson and Thomson , 1976 ; Chalfie et al . , 1985 ) , INS - 10 acts hormonally on the TRNs . INS - 10 expression was greatly reduced by hypoxic conditions and dauer arrest ( Fig . 7 D – G ) . Under the same conditions , GFP or RFP expressed in the pharyngeal muscles ( driven by ceh - 22p or myo - 2p ) ortheTRNs ( mec - 3p ) changedmuchless . Thesechanges in expression were not caused by starvation because starved L3 animals did not show them ( Fig . 7 D ) . These data suggest that the reduction of INS - 10 expression was not caused solely by a general 0 1 2 3 4 5 + daf - 2 age - 1 pdk - 1 akt - 1 akt - 2 daf - 16 daf - 18 pdk - 1 ( gf ) akt - 1 ( gf ) A T ou c h r e s pon s e * * * * A P A P A P A P A P A P A P A P A P A P + Null akt - 1 akt - 2 ALM : B 0 1 2 3 4 5 + e1370 e979 m41 C T ou c h R e s pon s e A P A P A P A P * * * D 0 1 2 3 4 5 - daf - 16 ( mgDf50 ) daf - 16 ( m26 ) daf - 2 ( e1370 ) A n t e r i o r r e s pon s e * * * Figure 5 .

Animals generating RNAi against ins - 10 [ ins - 10 ( i ) ] were less sensitive to mechanical stimulation ( D 50 (cid:5) 2 . 1 (cid:8) 0 . 3 (cid:2) m , n (cid:5) 16 , p (cid:6) 0 . 001 , k (cid:5) 2 . 2 (cid:8) 0 . 4 ; Fig . 8 A ) than wild - type animals ( D 50 (cid:5) 1 . 1 (cid:8) 0 . 1 (cid:2) m , k (cid:5) 3 . 3 (cid:8) 0 . 3 , as noted above ) without changing the maximum calcium response ( data not shown ) . The anterior touch insensitivity of ins - 10 ( i ) animals was restored by akt - 1 ( gf ) , pdk - 1 ( gf ) , or by an equivalentconstructof pdk - 1 ( gf ) expressedonly in the TRNs [ TRN : : pdk - 1 ( gf ) ] ( Fig . 8 B ) , suggesting that INS - 10 acts via the insulin signaling pathway in the ALM neurons . Be - cause activation of integrin signaling compensates for the loss of insulin signaling in the TRNs ( Fig . 6 A ) , we expected and saw that the touch insensitivity of ins - 10 ( i ) was restored by overexpressing UNC - 112 / PAT - 2 in the TRNs and by vibration ( Figs . 6 C , 8 B ) . Moreover , hypoxia and the dauer state did not cause anterior touch insensitivity in akt - 1 ( gf ) , daf - 16 , and TRN : : pdk - 1 ( gf ) ani - mals ( Fig . 8 C , D ) . These data suggest that hypoxia and the dauer state prevent the release of INS - 10 from M4 and I5 , causing a reduction of insulin signaling in the ante - rior TRNs and the subsequent loss of touch sensitivity . ASE releases ins - 22 to modulate touch sensation The loss of ins - 22 ( tm4990 ) also reduced anterior touch sensitivity ( Fig . 7 A ) with - out affecting normal development or dauer formation ( data not shown ) . As with ins - 10 , the ins - 22 touch insensitivity was rescued by the wild - type gene ( Fig . 7 A ) , daf - 16 , TRN : : pdk - 1 ( gf ) ( Fig . 9 A ) , and vibration ( Fig . 6 C ) . ins - 22 is expressed strongly in both ASE cells ( Fig . 9 B ) , sensory neurons that sense the ions ( Na (cid:3) , Cl (cid:7) , but not CH 3 COO (cid:7) and NH 4 (cid:3) ; Ortiz et al . , 2009 ) whose elevation reduces anterior touch sensitivity ( Fig . 2 D ) . che - 1 animals , which lack both ASE cells , have reduced anterior touch sensitivity that can be restored by TRN : : pdk - 1 ( gf ) ( Fig . 9 C ) , suggesting that INS - 22 from the ASE cells regulates TRN touch sensitivity . Consistent with this hy - pothesis , INS - 22 expression was reduced when the animals were grown in high salt ( Fig . 9 B , D ) , and the reduced touch sensi - tivity produced by high salt was rescued by akt - 1 ( gf ) , pdk - 1 ( gf ) , TRN : : pdk - 1 ( gf ) , and daf - 16 or TRN overexpression of UNC - 112 / PAT - 6 ( Fig . 9 E ) . Expressing daf - 16 a but not daf - 16b in the TRNs of daf - 16 animals caused them to reduce an - terior touch sensitivity on high salt . Animalswithout ins - 22 , however , were more sensitive to anterior touch than ei - ther che - 1 mutants or wild - type animals grown on high salt ( Fig . 9 A , C , E ) . More - over , we were unable to detect significant changes in the sensitivity of ins - 22 ani - mals ( D 50 (cid:5) 0 . 9 (cid:8) 0 . 2 (cid:2) m , n (cid:5) 10 , k (cid:5) 3 . 7 (cid:8) 0 . 8 ) . These results suggest that loss ofadditionalcomponentsotherthanINS - 22 , perhaps other neuropeptides from the ASE neurons , signals high salt conditions to the TRNs . Modulation of touch sensitivity adapts animals to diverse conditions A striking aspect of the effects of high salt , hypoxia , dauer , and prolonged vibration is that they change only anterior touch sen - sitivity . Anterior touch , but not posterior touch , causes an initial backing usually followed by a turn so animals go in a new forward direction ( Croll , 1975 ; Chalfie and Sulston , 1981 ) . Therefore , reducing anterior touch sensitivity may cause wild - type animals to change movement directions less in response to nonlocalized mechanical distractions , such as short vibratory pulse , which ac - tivates both anterior and posterior TRNs . Indeed , ins - 10 ( i ) ani - mals moved backward less often than wild - type animals ( Fig . 10 A ) when given a short pulse of vibration ( 0 . 5 s , 50 Hz ) , and as a result changed directions less than wild - type ( average turning angles are 22 . 5 (cid:8) 2 . 6° in wild - type vs 6 . 24 (cid:8) 1 . 8° in akt - 1 animals ; N (cid:5) 4 , p (cid:6) 0 . 005 ) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 + - ins - 10 ( + ) rde - 1 - ins - 10 ( + ) - ins - 22 ( + ) A n t e r i o r r e s pon s e * * * A ins - 10 ( i ) ins - 10 ins - 22 Normoxic Hypoxic E Well - fed L3 Starved L3 Dauer D 0 1 2 3 4 5 - mock I5 M4 I5 + M4 A n t e r i o r R e s pon s e Ablated : C * B MC RMF / RMH M4 I5 Well - fed Starved 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 M4 I5 pharynx TRN N o r m a li z ed i n t e n s i t y L3 dauer F 0 0 . 5 1 M4 I5 pharynx TRN N o r m a li z ed I n t en s i t y normal hypoxia G Figure 7 .

ChenandChalfie • MechanosensoryModulationin C . elegans J . Neurosci . , May7 , 2014 • 34 ( 19 ) : 6522 – 6536 • 6531 Such increased resistance to mechani - cal distraction may facilitate the comple - tion of non - mechanosensory tasks . We tested how fast animals moved to a source of an attractant ( diacetyl ) when the plates were tapped once every 30 s ( see Materials and Methods ) . This stimulus activates the TRNs . Although some habituation was seen , many animals still responded to the stimulus at the end of the trial . Fewer wild - type animals reached the diacetyl spot when the plate was tapped than when it was not tapped ( Fig . 10 B , C ) , suggesting that the mechanosensory response inter - fered with the efficiency of chemotaxis . Wild - type dauers and ins - 10 ( i ) animals moved slower ( data not shown ) in gen - eral , but they were slightly more efficient at chemotaxis when tapped ( Fig . 10 B , C ) . To compensate for the slowing of the an - imals , we looked at ins - 10 ( i ) animals in which pdk - 1 ( gf ) was expressed in the TRNs ( Fig . 10 B , C ) . These animals were sensitive to touch and , like wild - type ani - mals , chemotaxed much slower with in - termittent tapping . These results suggest that reduction of touch sensitivity in the TRNs was responsible for the change in chemotaxis efficiency when the plates weretapped . Thechangeinanteriortouch sensitivity allows animals to be less dis - tracted by mechanical signals while they are responding to other senses . Sensitization , in contrast , partially counteracts the effect of habituation that also occurs during sustained vibration : (cid:2) 10 % more animals responded to a strongervibratorypulse ( 0 . 5s ) givenat2h during sustained vibration , when the cells were sensitized , rather than at 1 h ( Fig . 10 D ) . This subtle yet statistically signifi - cant ( p (cid:6) 0 . 01 ) difference in responsive - ness became more significant during the recovery following habituation . Wild - type animals recovered 95 % of the unha - bituated response to anterior touch after 10 min of rest following 3 h of vibration compared with 35 % for akt - 1 mutants ( Fig . 10 E ) . In contrast the posterior touch response showed no significant recovery by 30 min ( Fig . 10 F ) .

Long - term sensitization acts via a pathway that joins the insulin signal - ing pathway , which is affected by several stress signals . The joining of these pathways allows the integration of several differ - ent modulatory inputs into a single output . In addition , these various responses occur only in the anterior TRNs and not in the posterior cells . Kindt et al . ( 2007 ) also found a difference between the anterior and posterior cells with regard to short - term habit - uation . Together these results suggest that these very similar looking touch - sensing cells actually function quite differently . Integrins sensitize the anterior TRNs Integrins anchor cells to the ECM and serve as cellular mechano - sensors . The activation of integrins by mechanical force induces diverse changes such as cell proliferation and differentiation ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2012 ) . Integrin sig - naling has been implicated in the function of mechanosensory cells . For example , rats exposed to strong auditory stimuli in - creased the expression of integrins in the cochlear sensory epithelium ; this change correlated with a shift in hearing thresh - old ( Cai et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , mechanical hyperalgesia , where normal touch elicits a painful response , is reduced by blocking integrin signaling ( Dina et al . , 2004 ) . The role of integrin signaling , how - ever , in neuronal mechanosensation is unclear in these examples . Our results show that the integrins are needed for the long - term sensitization of the anterior TRNs . The initial detection of prolonged stimulation does not require the MEC - 4 channel . Given their involve - ment in this sensitization and their ac - tions in other cells , the integrins are prime candidates for the secondary mechano - transducer in the TRNs . This hypothesis does not exclude the possibility that integ - rins detect changes in the ECM caused by prolonged stimulation and thus act as a signaling molecule ( indeed , change in ECM proteins usually accompanies or leads to integrin activation ; Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2012 ) . Because integrins respond less quickly than the MEC - 4 channels , they are more suited for detecting sus - tained stimuli . We propose that these two systems respond to different mechanical signals ; the MEC - 4 channels are activated by changes in displacement , whereas the focal adhesions respond to sustained or repeated force . In addition MEC - 4 chan - nels do not require the him - 4 - dependent anchorage of the TRNs to the hypodermis to function , but the integrins and sensiti - zation do . Sensitization counters habituation during sustained stimulation Similar sensitization is seen in mamma - lian hearing and mechanical nociception ( Kujawa and Liberman , 1999 ; Govindaraju et al . , 2006 ; Chen et al . , 2010 ) , suggesting that sensitization following sustained stim - ulation may be a conserved and common characteristic of mechanosensory systems . The counteracting effects of sensitiza - tion and habituation , both occurring after sustained stimuli , pose an intriguing dilemma : why would the animal reduce the behav - ioral response but concurrently become more sensitive to the stimulus ? Our data suggest that sensitization allows animals to respond better during and after habituation . Habituation attenuates the response to repeated stimulation . This process allows the animal to ignore background stimuli , but also reduces its sensitivity to specific stimuli , making the animal more vulnerable to predators ( Maguire et al . , 2011 ) . Sensitized animals respond slightly better during background stimulation ( Fig . 10 D ) , but much better after the cessation of background stimulation ( Fig . 10 E ) .

Neurosci . , May7 , 2014 • 34 ( 19 ) : 6522 – 6536 • 6533 tain their defenses against predators in the face of sustained back - ground stimulation . Because sensitization occurs over hours , but habituation can occur within minutes ( Rankin et al . , 1990 ) , sen - sitization may be a further adaptation to prolonged habituation to reduce risks associated with attenuated touch response . Long - term sensitization , thus , could provide a strong survival advan - tage in the wild under conditions that might stimulate the animals mechanically for prolonged periods , such as rain , which is simulated by our 1 Hz stimulation experiment . Neurohormones coordinate senses under stress conditions Sensory modulation optimizes behavioral outcomes in many species ( Sillar and Skorupski , 1986 ; Maney and Pinaud , 2011 ) . These changes in sensory perception allow different behavioral responses depending on environmental cues . Here we show that stress conditions sensed by several other cells modulate C . elegans touch sensitivity through insulin - like neurohormones . If insulin - based regulation of touch sensitivity is more general , the loss of insulin signaling may underlie neuropathic numbness in hu - mans , a common early symptom during prediabetic neuropathy ( Vincent et al . , 2011 ) . Mechanosensory responses are robust and faster than those of other senses , such as olfaction or thermal sensitivity ; they , thus , take priority over other senses in determining an animal’s behav - ior . Our data suggest , however , that this neuronal priority can be reordered through neurohormonal modulation . We saw , for ex - ample , that animals with reduced anterior touch sensitivity per - formed better when chemotaxing in the presence of mechanical distraction . Therefore , the reduction of touch sensitivity under stress conditions may facilitate escape from the stress environ - ment by lowering the priority of mechanosensation . Conversely , we imagine that under good conditions , increased touch sensitiv - ity would prepare the animals for escape from mechanical signals in the face of favorable environmental signals that would other - wise have them remain in place . Previous studies by Kindt et al . ( 2007 ) on dopamine modulation of touch habituation also sup - port this hypothesis . Such a change in priority may be an important adaptive change in the wild . In particular , we find that dauer larvae actu - ally accumulate more rapidly at a source of an attractive chemo - sensory signal when mechanical stimuli are present ( Fig . 10 D ) . Thus , in this instance mechanosensory signals can attract rather than repel , a reversal of the normal sensory behavior . Interest - ingly , Torr et al . ( 2004 ) found that infectious larvae ( the equiva - lent to the C . elegans dauer larvae ) from three different nematodes , Steinernema carpocapsae , S . feltiae , and Heterorhab - ditismegidis , whichparasitizeinsects , werebetterabletofindprey ( greater wax moth larvae ) when vibratory signals were present . The organization of sensory modulatory networks Although many sensory cells ( Fex , 1967 ; Sillar and Skorupski , 1986 ; Massey and Redburn , 1987 ) receive synaptic inputs from efferent neurons , the TRNs receive no obvious synaptic inputs ( Chalfie et al . , 1985 ) . Our data indicate , however , that a complex , nonsynaptic signaling network integrates multiple non - mechanical signals to modify the activity of the TRNs . Modulatory signals from different neurons converge on the TRNs through different neuropeptides : the M4 / I5 cells secrete INS - 10 , and the ASE cells rely on INS - 22 and possibly other neuropeptides . The M4 / I5 cells are pharyngeal interneuron / mo - tor neurons that control pharyngeal pumping . These cells , how - ever , also secrete multiple neuropeptides ( Rogers et al . , 2003 ) and receive neurohormonal inputs ( Pocock and Hobert , 2010 ) from outside of the pharynx . These observations and our data suggest that the M4 and I5 neurons act as neurohormonal hubs that function similarly to interneurons in a synaptic network : they integrate information and modulate multiple downstream neu - rons through diverse neurohormonal peptides . These cells may constitute a primitive neuroendocrine system similar to the Drosophila pars intercerebralis and pars lateralis and the mam - malian hypothalamus ( Hartenstein , 2006 ) , which also secrete neuropeptides and hormones to regulate animal behavior and development .

Thisnonsynapticnet - work may potentially mediate modulation of touch sensitivity through additional neuropeptides , including the FLPs , NLPs , oxytocin / vasopressin - like neuropeptides , and other redundant or negatively acting insulin - like peptides . Subsequently , the input of the insulin signals is integrated with that of integrin signaling , which respond to mechanical ac - tivation , by AKT - 1 and AKT - 2 in the TRNs . The AKT kinases then suppress the activity of DAF - 16 / FOXO transcription factor , whichprovidesacommonmechanismtointegratebothmechan - ical and non - mechanical modulatory signals . The relatively slow rate of transcriptional regulation probably explains why all four conditions require several hours to affect touch sensitivity . This convergence allows compensation between conflicting modula - tory signals from different modalities : the reduced touch sensi - tivity under non - mechanical stress conditions or in insulin signaling mutants can be restored by mechanical stimulation , and the reduced touch sensitivity caused by loss of integrin Anterior TRN ASE Hypoxia & Dauer High Salt Vibration AKT - 1 , AKT - 2 AKT kinase DAF - 16 FOXO Integrins & Focal adhesion DAF - 2 Insulin receptor INS - 10 INS - 22 + ?
