The best - characterized disassembly proteins , the ADF / cofilins / twinstar , sever filaments and recycle monomers to promote actin assembly . Cofilin is also a relatively weak actin disassembler , posing questions about mechanisms of cellular F - actin destabilization . Here we uncover a key link to targeted F - actin disassembly by finding that F - actin is efficiently dismantled through a post - translational - mediated synergism between cofilin and the actin - oxidizing enzyme Mical . We find that Mical - mediated oxidation of actin improves cofilin binding to filaments , where their combined effect dramatically accelerates F - actin disassembly compared to either effector alone . This synergism is also necessary and sufficient for F - actin disassembly in vivo , magnifying the effects of both Mical and cofilin on cellular remodeling , axon guidance , and Semaphorin / Plexin repulsion . Mical and cofilin , therefore , form a Redox - dependent synergistic pair that promotes F - actin instability by rapidly dismantling F - actin and generating post - translationally modified actin that has altered assembly properties .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Multiple cellular behaviors depend on the rapid assembly and disassembly of the actin filament ( F - actin ) cytoskeleton 1 . Under cellular conditions , F - actin assembly is favored 2 , 3 , making it critical to clarify how targeted and rapid F - actin disassembly occurs . In addition , specific extracellular cues including repellents such as ephrins , slits , semaphorins , myelin - associated inhibitors , and Wnts selectively collapse F - actin networks 4 – 6 , but their direct effectors are still enigmatic . The best - known F - actin disassembly proteins , the ubiquitous ADF / cofilins , sever actin filaments and recycle monomers with a net effect of promoting new actin assembly 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 . Moreover , cofilin’s relatively weak disassembly of actin 9 – 11 further complicates the current understanding of cellular F - actin destabilization . Recently , we identified an unusual class of F - actin regulatory proteins , the MICALs , which are multidomain Redox enzymes that induce F - actin disassembly via the direct post - translational oxidation of actin 12 , 13 . Notably , this Mical - modified actin no longer assembles normally 13 , 14 , differentiating Mical’s effects from that of other F - actin disassembly proteins 2 , 3 . Cellular and in vivo work has also revealed that MICALs are widely - expressed in different tissues 5 , 15 – 18 and control multiple cellular behaviors including motility , axon guidance , synaptogenesis , immune responses , cardiovascular integrity , muscle function , and tumorigenesis 12 – 14 , 18 – 25 . The MICALs have also been identified as working with different growth factors , adhesion molecules , and repulsive guidance cues to exert their effects 12 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 27 . Yet , nothing is known of how MICALs integrate with other better - known actin regulatory proteins to direct actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular functions . We now find that Mical synergizes with the ubiquitous actin regulatory protein cofilin to dramatically enhance the dismantling of actin filaments . This coupling between Mical and cofilin depends on the Redox - mediated post - translational alteration of actin . Mical oxidation of actin improves cofilin binding to filaments accelerating F - actin severing and disassembly by over an order of magnitude compared to either effector alone . This synergism also regulates F - actin disassembly in vivo and serves to remodel cells , wire the nervous system , and orchestrate Semaphorin / Plexin repulsive signaling . The Redox - dependent synergy between Mical and cofilin , therefore , rapidly disassembles F - actin and also generates oxidized actin that reassembles abnormally . This collective action has a net effect of promoting F - actin instability , revealing a previously unknown pathway of cellular F - actin disassembly . RESULTS Cofilin modulates Mical Redox - mediated F - actin disassembly Mical Redox enzymes are a new type of actin regulator – one that controls filament dynamics via the direct post - translational oxidation of actin 12 , 13 . Specifically , the enzyme activity of MICALs is activated in the presence of their substrate F - actin , which triggers consumption of Mical’s coenzyme NADPH and stereospecific oxidation of actin’s methionine ( M ) 44 and M47 residues to induce F - actin disassembly ( Fig . 1a ; 12 – 14 , 20 , 21 , 28 – 31 ) . Mical’s characteristic consumption of NADPH in an F - actin dependent manner has thus provided a simple biochemical test for proteins that may affect Mical’s activity . We found that the well - known actin regulatory protein – cofilin 7 , 8 – strongly Grintsevich et al . Page 2 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 January 25 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t suppressed the ability of F - actin to trigger Mical - mediated NADPH consumption ( Figs . 1b – c ; Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The ubiquitous actin depolymerizing / severing factor cofilin is known to change the conformation of the D - loop of actin 32 , which harbors Mical’s substrate residues M44 and M47 13 . These results , coupled with the observation that non - muscle human cofilin - 1 is a relatively weak severer of F - actin 9 – 11 , prompted our investigation of a possible interrelation between Mical and cofilin effects on actin . In light of our NADPH consumption results ( Fig . 1b – c ) , we first wondered if cofilin affected Mical’s ability to bind to its substrate F - actin . However , using co - sedimentation assays we did not observe any difference in the ability of Mical to associate with F - actin in the presence or absence of cofilin ( Fig . 1d ) . Therefore , we tested if cofilin affected Mical’s ability to disassemble F - actin . Strikingly , we found that preincubation of F - actin with cofilin , which alone only minimally affects F - actin disassembly under these conditions ( Fig . 1e ) , dramatically enhanced Mical - mediated F - actin disassembly ( Fig . 1f – g ) . The rate of disassembly was greater than the combined rates with cofilin and Mical added individually ( Fig . 1h ) , which was also confirmed by co - sedimentation ( Fig . 1i ) . This cooperation was not observed in the absence of NADPH ( see Supplementary Fig . 1b – e ) , which rules out the possibility that cofilin and Mical without its NADPH coenzyme form a complex that is more efficient in F - actin dismantling than its individual components . Thus , cofilin enhances Mical - mediated actin filament disassembly and their synergistic effect requires the NADPH - dependent Redox activity of Mical . Cofilin synergizes with Mical to accelerate F - actin disassembly We therefore reasoned that cofilin might enhance Mical - mediated F - actin disassembly by allowing Mical to more efficiently oxidize its M44 and M47 substrate residues on actin ( and thereby consume less NADPH in the process ) . To test for this possibility it was important to develop an independent assay for M44 / M47 actin oxidation , since NADPH consumption is not an accurate measure of Mical - mediated F - actin oxidation and occurs to some extent even in the absence of F - actin ( Fig . 1c and 13 ) . We found that the enzyme subtilisin , which under limited proteolysis conditions cleaves unoxidized actin between M47 and G48 ( 33 ) , does not cleave Mical - oxidized actin under such conditions ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Figs . 1f , 2a – c ) . Using this observation as an assay , we found that cofilin strongly decreased Mical’s rate of F - actin oxidation ( Fig . 2b ) . Furthermore , generating antibodies that specifically recognized the wild - type ( unoxidized ) M44 residue of actin ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) and the Mical stereospecifically oxidized M44 residue of actin ( MetO - 44 ) ( Fig . 2c ) , allowed us to confirm that cofilin does not increase the efficiency of Mical - mediated F - actin oxidation , but actually suppresses it ( Figs . 2d , Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . Comparison of the time courses of Mical - mediated F - actin oxidation ( Fig . 2b and d ) and F - actin disassembly ( Fig 2e , left ; and 13 ) , indicated that Mical rapidly ( ~ 1 min ) oxidizes F - actin but it takes hundreds of seconds for Mical - oxidized actin to disassemble . Strikingly , the addition of cofilin dramatically accelerated the disassembly of Mical - oxidized actin filaments ( Fig . 2e , right ) . Thus , Mical rapidly oxidizes but only relatively slowly disassembles filaments , and cofilin markedly accelerates this disassembly . These results are also consistent with cofilin’s suppressive effects on Mical - mediated NADPH consumption and actin oxidation ( Figs . 1c , 2b and 2d ) , because they reveal that Mical and cofilin combine to rapidly disassemble ( i . e . , deplete ) F - Grintsevich et al .

Mical - mediated oxidation of actin weakens the mechanical properties of filaments To more directly monitor and quantify the effect of Mical oxidation of actin and its disassembly by cofilin , we purified Mical - oxidized actin ( Methods and 13 , 14 ) . We found that Mical - oxidized actin forms filaments , but such filaments have altered polymerization kinetics and a critical concentration of at least an order of magnitude higher than that of unmodified actin ( ≥1μM ) ( Fig . 3a – e , Supplementary Fig . 2f ; see also 13 , 14 ) . Specifically , purified Mical - oxidized actin did not exhibit noticeable polymerization at 1 . 1 μM ( Fig . 3a ; 13 , 14 ) , but did polymerize to increasing levels when incubated at 2 . 2 μM , 3 . 3 μM and 4 . 4 μM ( Fig . 3b – d ) . However , we found that polymerization of Mical - oxidized actin proceeded after a longer nucleation phase than normal and ( consistent with the higher critical concentration ) reached lower plateau levels than observed for unmodified actin ( Fig . 3b – d ) . Notably , re - treating the purified Mical - oxidized actin with Mical / NADPH did not alter its polymerization properties ( Fig . 3d ) , indicating that Mical - oxidized actin is not significantly reduced during purification and storage . Thus , above its critical concentration values , Mical - oxidized actin polymerizes but with abnormal kinetics indicative of the inhibited nucleation phase . Further analysis of purified Mical - oxidized actin revealed that it also copolymerized with unoxidized actin monomers ( Fig . 3f ; see also Fig . S11C of 13 ) . We employed subtilisin digestion to quantify the extent of Mical - oxidized actin incorporation into such copolymers ( Fig . 3f ) . This allowed us to form and examine copolymers containing different and well - determined fractions of Mical - oxidized actin . Our results revealed that unlike unoxidized filaments , Mical - oxidized actin filaments easily fragment upon minimal handling ( gentle pipetting and mixing ) . Even copolymers composed of low amounts of Mical - oxidized actin ( 11 % ) had a significantly lower mechanical stability than non - oxidized actin filaments ( Fig . 3g – h ) . Therefore , Mical - oxidized actin copolymers have different mechanical properties than non - oxidized actin . Cofilin accelerates the dismantling of Mical - oxidized actin filaments To directly assess the effect of cofilin on the disassembly dynamics of filaments composed of Mical - oxidized actin , we polymerized purified Mical - oxidized actin and employed time - lapse TIRF microscopy . We first grew filaments composed of 100 % Mical - oxidized actin from unoxidized F - actin seeds . Dramatically , such Mical - oxidized actin filaments were rapidly dismantled by the addition of cofilin within the solution exchange time ( ~ 30 s ) ( Fig . 4a , lower right ) but not upon addition of buffer ( Fig . 4a , lower middle panel ) . Under the same conditions , F - actin severing in the presence of Mical / NADPH or cofilin only was much weaker ( see Supplementary Fig . 3a , Fig . 4a [ compare upper right to lower right ] ) . Thus , these results confirmed our observations using both pyrene - actin and actin sedimentation assays ( Figs . 1e - i , 2e ) and demonstrated that cofilin markedly accelerates Mical - mediated F - actin disassembly .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Mical - mediated oxidation of actin increases cofilin’s binding and severing of filaments We also examined the effects of partial Mical - oxidation on cofilin - mediated F - actin disassembly by employing copolymers with known amounts of Mical - oxidized actin incorporated . We found that even “lightly oxidized” F - actin copolymers ( 11 % Mical - oxidized actin ) accelerated cofilin severing by more than an order of magnitude ( 22 - fold ) compared to that of unmodified control F - actin ( Fig . 4b – c , Supplementary Fig . 3e , Supplementary Movies 1 – 2 ) . Increasing the content of the Mical - oxidized actin in the copolymers further accelerated cofilin severing and disassembly ( Supplementary Movies S3 – S4 , Fig . 4a , compare upper right to lower right ) , and this effect was not cofilin isoform specific since we also observed it with yeast cofilin ( Supplementary Fig . 3b – d ) . Thus , the presence of Mical - oxidized actin makes cofilin much more efficient at F - actin disassembly . Furthermore , when assisted by cofilin , partial oxidation of actin filaments by Mical is sufficient for their fast disassembly . Additional analysis using two - color TIRF microscopy and co - sedimentation also indicated improved cofilin binding to filaments containing Mical - oxidized actin when compared to unoxidized control filaments ( Fig . 4d – e , Supplementary Movies 5 – 6 , Supplementary Figs . 4 – 5 ) . In light of the extremely rapid nature of cofilin severing of Mical - oxidized F - actin , we quantified this improved cofilin binding by employing F - actin composed of either Q41C actin ( yeast ) or ANP - modified ( skeletal ) F - actin , since they both become disassembly - resistant when cross - linked between residues 41 and 374 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Using this disassembly - resistant F - actin , we found that more cofilin co - sediments with filaments containing Mical - oxidized actin in comparison to unoxidized cross - linked control filaments ( Figs . 3d – e , Supplementary Fig . 5 ) Therefore , Mical - oxidized actin increases both cofilin binding to filaments and the rate and extent of cofilin - mediated F - actin disassembly . Cofilin modulates Mical - mediated Redox - dependent F - actin disassembly and cellular remodeling in vivo In view of these results , we wondered if Mical and cofilin might also work together in vivo . Both cofilin and Mical have widespread effects on the organization of actin in vivo ( reviewed in 5 , 7 , 8 , 15 – 18 ) . For instance , Mical is required to shape Drosophila bristles , which are well - characterized cells ( Fig . 5a ) that provide a high - resolution model to study actin organization and dynamics in vivo 5 , 34 , 35 . Cofilin ( which is encoded by the twinstar gene in Drosophila ) is also required for shaping Drosophila bristles 36 . Thus we employed the bristle model to assay the interaction between Mical and cofilin in vivo . Elevating the levels of Mical specifically in bristle cells results in F - actin disassembly and cellular remodeling ( Fig . 5b ) that is dependent on Mical’s Redox activity and its M44 substrate residue within actin 12 – 14 . Notably , cofilin and Mical exhibited overlapping localization patterns within developing bristles ( Fig . 5c ) and removing even a single copy of cofilin ( cofilin heterozygous mutants ) significantly suppressed the F - actin reorganization and bristle remodeling effects that are dependent on Mical ( compare Fig . 5d with Fig . 5b ; Figs . 5f – g , Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Moreover , raising the levels of cofilin significantly enhanced Mical - mediated effects on F - actin and cellular morphology ( compare Fig . 5e with Fig . 5b ; Fig . 5f – g ) . Further analysis revealed that cofilin’s effects on Mical - mediated F - actin Grintsevich et al . Page 5 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 January 25 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t reorganization in vivo were dependent on Mical’s M44 substrate residue within actin ( Fig . 5h ) . Similarly , SelR ( MsrB ) , which is an enzyme that reverses Mical - mediated oxidation of actin 14 , 20 , reversed cofilin’s ability to enhance Mical’s effects on F - actin reorganization ( Fig . 5h ) . Thus , Mical - mediated F - actin alterations in vivo , as in vitro , are modulated by cofilin . Mical and cofilin synergize to drive Semaphorin - Plexin repulsive signaling and axon guidance In light of our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrating a synergistic action between Mical and cofilin , it is notable that Mical and cofilin exhibit widespread overlapping expression patterns 18 , 37 and both mediate the effects of growth factors , adhesion molecules , and guidance cues on diverse cellular behaviors ( reviewed in 5 , 7 , 8 , 15 – 18 ) . For instance , Mical associates with Plexins , which are receptors for one of the largest families of guidance cues – the Semaphorins ( Semas ) , and plays critical roles in Semaphorin / Plexin repulsive signaling ( reviewed in 5 ) . Cofilin has also been linked to Semaphorin repulsion 5 , 38 – 42 , but its role and mechanisms of action in this regard have remained poorly understood . Since Mical - mediated bristle actin remodeling occurs in response to Semaphorin / Plexin repulsive guidance signaling 12 , 14 , we wondered if cofilin could also be linked with Mical in mediating Semaphorin / Plexin repulsion . To test this hypothesis , we first employed the bristle system and our genetic experiments demonstrated that cofilin was necessary for Semaphorin / Plexin / Mical - mediated effects on cellular remodeling ( Supplementary Fig . 6b – c ) . Next , we turned to in vivo axon guidance assays using the Drosophila model nervous system , where Semaphorins - Plexins ( Sema - 1a and Plexin A ) serve as repulsive axon guidance cues - receptors and were first functionally linked to Mical 19 . Notably , we found that cofilin ( tsr ) mutants exhibit axon guidance defects that are similar to loss of Sema - 1a , Plexin A , and Mical ( Fig . 6a – c , Supplementary Fig . 6d ; 19 , 43 , 44 ) . Furthermore , we observed transheterozygous genetic interactions between cofilin and Mical mutants ( Fig . 6c ) , indicating they function in the same signaling pathway to mediate axon guidance . Moreover , we found that increasing the levels of cofilin enhanced Sema - Plexin - Mical repulsive axon guidance , while decreasing the levels of cofilin suppressed these guidance effects ( Fig . 6d – f ) . These results further support that Mical and cofilin work together in vivo , as in vitro , and indicate that their synergistic effects are also instrumental for Semaphorin - Plexin repulsive signaling and axon guidance . DISCUSSION Here we have found that Mical and cofilin function as a pair – synergizing in a Redox - dependent post - translational manner to disassemble F - actin and to control different cellular behaviors . Specifically , cofilin is a well - established actin regulatory protein and a relatively weak severer of F - actin 9 – 11 . In contrast , Mical family Redox enzymes have only recently emerged downstream of Semaphorin - Plexin repellents as actin disassembly factors acting via the direct post - translational oxidation of actin 12 – 14 , 18 – 21 , 28 – 31 . Previous work has also revealed that Mical , whose C - terminus associates with the intracellular portion of the Semaphorin transmembrane receptor plexin 12 , 19 , binds with its N - terminal NADPH - Grintsevich et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t dependent Redox domain to F - actin and selectively oxidizes actin’s methionine - 44 and 47 residues ( Fig . 6g , left panel ; 12 – 14 ) . We propose that Mical oxidation - induced changes in filament structure and / or dynamics improve cofilin’s binding to actin filaments ( Fig . 6g , middle panel ) . Herein , we also find that Mical - oxidized actin copolymers have different properties than unoxidized actin filaments . It is also known that the severing of actin filaments by cofilin is related to the mechanical properties of F - actin 10 , 45 , 46 . Our results support the idea that Mical uses oxidation to weaken the inter - actin ( inter - protomer ) contacts within filaments ( 13 , present study ) and these alterations dramatically speed up cofilin’s ability to break / dismantle filaments ( Fig . 6g , right panel ) . These results , therefore , uncover a previously unknown pathway of cellular F - actin disassembly and also present an unusual type of biological synergistic interaction – one involving two different types of proteins ( Mical and cofilin ) and the Redox - dependent post - translational modification of a third protein ( polymerized actin ) . Our results also shed new light on the mechanisms of action of both Mical and cofilin . They support a model that Mical and cofilin have been evolutionarily selected to work in tandem to ensure that even a low level of Mical activity in the presence of cofilin would facilitate F - actin disassembly , and vice versa . Moreover , unlike F - actin disassembly by cofilin , which promotes actin turnover by recirculation of monomers for polymerization 2 , 47 , Mical post - translationally modifies actin , decreasing its capacity for re - polymerization until the oxidation is reversed ( Fig . 6g , right panel ) . Thus , the Redox - driven synergy between Mical and cofilin not only rapidly disassembles F - actin but also generates post - translationally modified actin that re - assembles abnormally with a net effect of promoting F - actin instability . These results , therefore , provide important insights into how actin - based structures are rapidly and specifically dismantled in cells . Given their widespread overlapping expression patterns ( reviewed in 18 , 37 ) and diverse effects on cellular behaviors ( reviewed in 5 , 7 , 8 , 15 – 18 ) , this synergistic interaction between Mical and cofilin provides the molecular framework to rapidly dismantle multiple actin - based cellular structures . Methods Protein purification Drosophila Mical redoxCH construct ( referred to as Mical in this study ) 12 , 56 rabbit skeletal actin 57 , Drosophila actin mutant M44L / M47L ( 13 ) , yeast actin 58 , and human cofilin - 1 ( 59 ) were expressed and purified as previously described . Yeast cofilin was expressed and purified essentially as described 60 . In brief , yeast cofilin expression was induced at OD 600 = 0 . 8 with 1mM IPTG and carried - out for 4 hours at 37°C . Cell lysate was loaded on QAE - 52 column equilibrated with 20mM Tris – HCl ( pH7 . 5 at 4°C ) containing 1mM DTT , 0 . 2mM PMSF and cofilin was eluted with linear gradient of NaCl ( 0 – 500mM ) in 5 column volumes . Cofilin containing fractions were then gel - filtered on HiLoad 16 / 60 Superdex 75 ( Amersham Biosciences ) column equilibrated with 20mM Tris – HCl ( pH7 . 5 at 4°C ) , 200mM NaCl , 1mM DTT , 0 . 2mM PMSF . Purified cofilin was stored at −80°C . Grintsevich et al . Page 7 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 January 25 .

Polymerized F - actin was then diluted to 2μM and supplemented with NADPH ( 0 . 4mM ) and Mical 0 . 2μM ( 10 : 1 molar ratio , actin to Mical , unless stated otherwise ) . Mical - oxidation of actin was carried out for 2 hours at RT . Oxidation efficiency under chosen conditions was confirmed by mass spectrometry . After 2 hours any residual F - actin was pelleted at 100 , 000g for 20 min at 4°C . Resulting supernatant containing Mical - oxidized actin ( ox - actin ) was dialyzed overnight into buffer G ( GB 2 ) : 2mM Tris , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5mM DTT , 0 . 2mM ATP , pH 8 . Actin was gel filtered using Superdex S200 16 / 60 column . Efficiency of oxidation was confirmed in subtilisin digestion assay ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Mical - treated / oxidized pyrene actin was purified as described 13 , 14 . To examine repolymerization of Mical - treated actin , the purified actin was resuspended to 2 . 3μM in GB 5 , and polymerization was initiated with 2X polymerization buffer ( 10mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1M KCl , 4mM MgCl 2 , 2mM EGTA , 0 . 4mM ATP , 1mM DTT ) to get a final concentration of 1 . 15μM actin . To further test the ability of Mical - treated actin to repolymerize , the purified actin was resuspended to 4 . 4μM or 8 . 8μM in GB 5 , and polymerization was initiated as described above with 2X polymerization buffer ( to yield a final concentration of actin at 2 . 2μM and 4 . 4μM , respectively ) . To determine whether Mical - oxidized actin might be reduced during its purification and storage , purified Mical - treated actin was polymerized ( as described above ) , and then re - treated with 600nM of Mical and 200μM NADPH . Polymerization was monitored using either fluorescence or sedimentation assays ( described below ) . Critical concentration ( Cc ) determination To determine the Cc , Mg - ATP - ox - actin was polymerized for 1 hour at RT by adding 10X polymerizing buffer , pH 6 . 8 , 7 . 0 , 7 . 5 or 8 . 0 . Samples were diluted then into their corresponding 1X polymerizing buffer ( pH 6 . 8 – 8 . 0 ) , followed by 4°C overnight incubation . Supernatants and pellets were separated by ultracentrifugation ( TLA100 , 62K , 30 min , 4°C ) and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and densitometry was performed using Scion Image software . The intersects of these linear plots of pelleted actin ( [ F - actin ] ) versus total actin ( [ Actin ( total ) ] ) with the abscissa yielded Cc in μM . The following buffers were used for Cc experiments : pH 6 . 8 : 20mM imidazole , pH 6 . 8 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM EGTA , 50mM KCl , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 5mM DTT ; pH 7 . 0 : 10mM Hepes , pH 7 . 0 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 4mM EGTA , 50mM KCl , 0 . 2mM ATP , 1mM DTT ; pH 7 . 5 : 5mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM EGTA , 50mM KCl , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 5mM DTT ; pH 8 . 0 : 10mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 50mM KCl , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 5mM DTT .

Actin labeling with Alexa488 - succinimidyl ester ( SE ) ( Molecular Probes ) was done essentially as described 61 but Alexa488SE dye was added to F - actin in 3 – 7 fold excess ( overnight , 4°C ) and then carried out as described above for Cy3 actin . Actin concentration was measured by Bradford assay or by quantitative gels ( Coomassie staining ) employing known concentrations of unlabeled RSA as standard . Alexa488SE - actin was used to obtain 100 % oxidized labeled ox - actin ( GB 2 , 70 : 1 ( actin : Mical ) molar ratio , 100μM NADPH , 1 hour at RT ) . The resulting actin was dialyzed overnight against GB 2 then centrifuged ( TLA100 rotor , 90 , 000 rpm , 30 min , 4°C ) . Oxidation was confirmed by limited proteolysis with subtilisin . Yeast cofilin - KCK construct ( for C - terminal labeling ) was modified with Cy5 - maleimide in buffer C : 5mM Tris , pH 7 , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 50μM TCEP ( 1 : 1 . 5 ( cofilin : Cy5 - maleimide ) molar ratio , 15 min at RT ) . Excess dye was removed using Zeba Desalt Spin Column ( Pierce ) equilibrated buffer C supplemented with 1mM DTT . Extinction coefficient of Cy5 was corrected for the solvent conditions ( DMF vs [ buffer C + 1mM DTT ] ) as described 62 and was estimated ε 643 = 121 , 420 M −1 cm −1 . Total concentration of labeled cofilin was measured by Bradford assay , using unlabeled WT yeast cofilin as a standard . NADPH consumption Different RSA concentrations ( unlabeled ; Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) were polymerized as described 13 . Each polymer sample ( or actin buffer only ) was then preincubated with cofilin ( human cofilin - 1 ; Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) or cofilin buffer ( 10mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 10mM NaCl , 5 % sucrose , 1 % dextran , 1mM DTT ) at pH of 6 . 8 . NADPH consumption was measured essentially as described 13 with the decrease in the reduced form of NADPH determined from the decreased light absorption at 340 nm or alternatively ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) , by the decreased fluorescence signal at 460 nm ( when excited at 340 nm ) . Actin disassembly assays Standard pyrene - actin and co - sedimentation assays using RSA ( pyrene - labeled or unlabeled ; Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) were performed as described 12 – 14 with minor modifications to adjust sample pH . Actin in GB 5 buffer was mixed with 10X polymerization buffer ( pH 6 . 8 , 200mM Imidazole , 500mM KCl , 20mM MgCl 2 , 2mM EGTA ) to yield 10μM actin . This mixture was then incubated on ice overnight for actin polymerization and diluted the next day to 2 . 5μM actin . Then , each polymer sample was incubated with cofilin ( or cofilin buffer ) , Mical ( or Mical buffer ) , and / or NADPH , at pH of 6 . 8 . In some cases , as described in the figures , the polymers were preincubated with cofilin ( or cofilin buffer ) or Mical ( or Mical buffer ) . For pyrene - labeled actin , the fluorescence intensity was monitored immediately and over time at 407 nm ( excitation at 365 nm ) by a fluorescence spectrophotometer ( Spectra max M2 , Molecular Devices ) as described 13 . For co - sedimentation assays , the intensity of each of the stained bands in the pellet and soluble fraction was quantified by densitometry using Image J ( NIH ) 13 or Scion Image software .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Subtilisin limited proteolysis assay Actin was polymerized at pH 6 . 8 for 1 hour at RT . Next , F - actin ( 3 . 5μM ) was mixed with hCofilin - 1 ( 3 . 5μM ) or buffer ( control ) to form complexes . Samples were supplemented with NADPH ( 0 . 1mM ) . After removing unoxidized controls , reactions were started by addition of 25 – 50nM Mical . Aliquots of the samples were removed at selected time points and oxidation was stopped by addition of 1 . 5mM NADP + and 3 . 5μM of Kabiramide C ( KabC , marine macrolide toxin , a kind gift from Dr . Gerard Marriott ) 63 . NADPH and KabC were also added to the control unoxidized actin / complexes . Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C for complete actin depolymerization . Then , reaction mixtures were digested with subtilisin ( limited proteolysis conditions ) at 1 : 200 subtilisin : actin w / w ratio for 20 – 30 min at RT . Subtilisin stock was prepared in 2mM Tris , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 and used within 9 min . Limited digestion was started by adding 1μl of subtilisin solution to the samples ( 25μl ) arranged in random order and stopped with PMSF ( 1mM ) . Samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( Coomassie stain ) . Densitometry analysis was performed using Scion Image software . Increased amounts of uncleaved actin reported on the accumulation of Mical - oxidized actin . After making corrections for undercleaved actin in unoxidized controls ( ~ 5 – 14 % ) , the amount of Mical - oxidized actin was plotted vs oxidation time . We elected to use subtilisin : actin ratio that yields slightly undercleaved preparation in order to restrict proteolysis to a single site ( 47 / 48 ) on actin . We have found that a higher ratio of subtilisin to actin is needed for limited digestion of actin samples depolymerized under F - buffer conditions . For limited digestion of G - actin / G - actin - KabC in GB ( pH 8 ) by subtilisin , we routinely used 1 : 1000 ( w / w ) ratio of subtilisin : actin . Using this assay we quantified the amount of Mical - oxidized actin incorporated into copolymers under conditions closely mimicking those of our TIRF experiments ( pH 6 . 8 , 1μM of total actin , 30 min polymerization at RT ) . After polymerization , F - actin was pelleted ( TLA110 rotor , 150 , 000g , 30 min , 4°C ) . Pellets were resuspended in 100μl of GB 2 and depolymerized overnight by dialysis ( against GB 2 ) , followed by a second high speed spin ( TLA100 rotor , 150 , 000g , 30 min , 4°C ) . Alternatively , samples were depolymerized by adding KabC ( 30μM ) followed by a 3 hour dialysis against GB 2 . Limited proteolysis with subtilisin was carried out at 1 : 1000 subtilisin : actin w / w ratio , for 15 – 20 min , at RT and stopped with PMSF ( 1mM ) . The resulting samples were analyzed by SDS - PAGE ( Coomassie staining ) . The fraction of ox - actin in the sample was determined ( Fig . 3f ) as described above . Actin Met - 44 and MetO - 44 Specific Antibodies We generated an antibody that preferentially recognized the unoxidized Met - 44 residue of actin ( Supplementary Fig . 2d 1 – d 3 ) . We also generated an antibody that specifically recognized the oxidized Met - 44 residue on actin ( MetO - 44 ) ( Fig . 2c ) . These antibodies were used to observe the effect of cofilin on Mical - mediated oxidation of actin , by incubating 1 . 15μM F - actin for 1 hour at RT with 1 . 15μM cofilin or cofilin buffer only . Then , 50nM Mical and 100μM NADPH were added and the reaction was stopped at 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 minutes ( or 1 hour ) by adding loading buffer containing β - mercaptoethanol and boiling samples for 5 minutes . For Western blotting , all samples were loaded into a 12 % SDS - PAGE , transferred to PVDF membrane , blocked with 5 % non - fat milk / TBST buffer for 1 Grintsevich et al . Page 10 Nat Cell Biol .

TIRF microscopy assays Copolymers of Mical - oxidized and unmodified actin were formed in flow chambers assembled with 25×75×1 glass slides ( Fisherfinest , Premium Slides , Superfrost , 12 - 544 - 7 ) and 22×30 – 1 . 5 glass coverslips ( Fisherbrand , 12 - 544 - A ) . Coverslips were treated with polylysine PEG solution ( 1 . 25mg / ml in H 2 O ) for 4 min , rinsed 3 times with water and air - dried . Single flow chambers ( V ~ 30μl ) were assembled using two layers of permanent double - sided Scotch tape . Before each experiment the flow chamber was treated with 2 chamber volumes ( CV ) of 1 % Pluronic F127 solution ( Sigma , P2443 ) 64 for 3 min then equilibrated with 5 CV of 1xTIRF imaging buffer ( 20mM imidazole , 2mM MgCl 2 , 50mM KCl , 0 . 2mM EGTA ( pH 6 . 8 ) supplemented with 50mM DTT , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 05mg / ml caseine , 20mM glucose , 0 . 25mg / ml glucose oxidase , 50μM catalase , 0 . 5 % methyl cellulose ) . G - actin mixtures ( 10 % Cy3b - maleimide labeled ) were incubated for 3 min at RT with Mg / EGTA exchange buffer ( 0 . 1mM EGTA , 50μM MgCl 2 ) and the resulting mixture ( 3 CV ) was introduced into the flow chamber . After 15 min of on - slide polymerization , the excess of actin monomers was removed with 1 CV of 1xTIRF imaging buffer . Since cofilin binds weaker to ADP - Pi - F - actin ( compared to ADP - F - actin ) 45 , 65 , filaments were aged on the surface to allow for phosphate release . For severing experiments with yeast actin , at least 3 fields were imaged between minutes 29 and 30 to determine the average filaments length before cofilin severing . At 30 min time point from the start of actin polymerization , cofilin / buffer ( 2 CV ) was introduced into the flow chamber and movies of severing were recorded . Copolymers containing 11 % ox - actin weren’t severed upon buffer additions within the monitoring time . Images were acquired every 5 sec . Filaments were imaged using DMI6000 TIRF microscope ( Leica ) . Average filament length of on - slide grown ox - actin copolymers ( 0 and 11 % oxidized ) was compared to those pre - polymerized in tubes and applied to the polyK surface ( related to Fig . 3h ) . On - slide polymerization was carried out as described above . Images were collected after 16 – 17 min from the beginning of polymerization ( immediately after the buffer wash , at 15 min of on - slide polymerization ) ( Fig . 3g ) . Experiments with pre - polymerized ox - actin copolymers ( 0 % and 11 % oxidized ) were performed as follows . Coverslips were treated with 1mg / ml polyK for 3 min , rinsed with mQ water and air - dried . Mg - ATP - G - actin ( 15 % Cy3b labeled ) was polymerized at 10μM by 1xKMEI6 . 8 buffer ( 20mM imidazole , 2mM MgCl 2 , 50mM KCl , 0 . 2mM EGTA ( pH 6 . 8 ) ) . F - actin samples were diluted to 8μM and mixed by pipetting up and down 2 times . The resulting mixtures were incubated 5 min at RT , followed by one step dilution into 1xKMEI6 . 8 buffer supplemented with 100mM DTT and 1μM phalloidin and mixing by inversion . Filaments’ length was measured manually using JFilament plugin to Fiji ( JFilament 2D ) . Severing of fully oxidized actin by human cofilin - 1 was examined as follows ( related to Fig . 3a ) . Flow chambers were assembled as described above . Untethered filaments were imaged on Pluronic F127 - coated surface 64 as described . F - actin - Cy3 - maleimide ( 15 % labeled ) was polymerized in 1xKMEI6 . 8 buffer overnight at 4°C and used as F - actin seeds . Mical - Grintsevich et al . Page 11 Nat Cell Biol .

After 20 min , unpolymerized monomers were washed with 1xTIRF buffer . To test for severing , 10nM of human cofilin - 1 in 1xTIRF buffer was introduced into the flow chambers . Filaments fragmentation induced by Mical in the presence of NADPH was monitored under the same conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 3a ) . Unoxidized filaments ( 15 % Alexa488SE ) were grown in the flow chambers then Mical ( 55nM ) / NADPH ( 100μM ) were introduced into the flow chamber simultaneously washing out the remaining actin monomers . Cofilin clustering on intact filaments and copolymers with ox - actin ( 11 % ) was imaged using two - color TIRF microscopy . Actin ( Alexa488 - SE , 23 % labeled ) and yeast cofilin ( Cy5 - maleimide labeled ) were copolymerized in flow chambers prepared as described above and imaged , unattached , on Pluronic F127 - coated surface 64 . Co - polymerization was started by simultaneous addition of cofilin - Cy5 and polymerizing salts to Mg - ATP - G - actin . Analysis of cofilin severing Fiji ( Image J ) software was employed for movie processing . Background subtraction was done using rolling ball radius algorithm ( routinely 10 pxls ) . Total filaments’ length ( L 0 ) was estimated using the first frame recorded after cofilin addition ( L 0 ( μm ) = sum of the lengths of all filaments in frame # 1 ) . Filaments’ length was measured manually using JFilament plugin to Fiji ( JFilament 2D ) . Bundled filaments were excluded from the analysis . To quantify cofilin severing of F - actin , the number of severing events ( cuts ) was counted manually for each frame , starting from frame # 2 . Cumulative number of cuts divided by L 0 ( cuts / μm ) was plotted versus time . Linear segments of the obtained dependencies were used to determine the rates of F - actin severing by cofilin ( Supplementary Fig . 3e ) . Between 31 and 45 filaments were analyzed in each movie . F - actin cross - linking Disulfide cross - linking of Q41C yeast actin mutant was carried out as follows . DTT - free Ca - ATP - Q41C actin was polymerized by adding 0 . 1 volume of polymerizing buffer ( 20mM imidazole , 50mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 ) for 1 hour at RT . Disulfide cross - linking in QC - F - actin was triggered by addition of CuSO 4 solution ( in water ) to F - actin in 1 : 1 . 5 ( actin : Cu ) molar ratio and carried out for 1 hour at RT . Cross - linked samples were supplemented with 1mM EGTA and dialyzed against 20mM imidazole , 50mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM ATP for ≥3 hours . Efficiency of cross - linking was confirmed by SDS - PAGE analysis under non - reducing conditions in the presence of NEM . Cross - linked and uncross - linked QC - F - actin and its cofilin complexes were subjected to Mical - mediated oxidation ( 140 : 1 , molar ratio Actin : Mical , thiol - free Mical preparation ) in the presence of 0 . 1mM NADPH under non - reducing ( DTT - free ) conditions for 1 hour at RT . Co - sedimentation with cofilin was performed as described above ( TLA100 rotor , 150 , 000g , 30 min , 4°C ) . N - ( 4 - azido - 2 - nitrophenyl ) putrescine ( ANP ) cross - linking was carried out as described 66 . In brief , thiol - free skeletal G - actin was incubated with ANP ( 1 : 8 , actin : ANP molar ratio ) and transglutaminase ( 2 units per 1mg of actin ) in DTT - free GB 2 ( pH 8 ) for 2 hours at RT . Actin was centrifuged to remove any aggregates ( 21 , 000g , 10 min , 4°C ) and then polymerized Grintsevich et al . Page 12 Nat Cell Biol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2017 January 25 .

Mical - mediated oxidation was started with the addition of thiol - free Mical to ANP - F - actin ( 1 : 140 , Mical : actin molar ratio ) for 1 hour at RT . Prior to photoactivation and cross - linking , the extent of Mical - mediated oxidation was assessed by subtilisin digestion . Cross - linking ( between Gln 41 - Cys 374 ) in Mical - oxidized and unoxidized ANP - F - actin was triggered by UV exposure ( 20 min at RT ) and stopped with 1mM DTT . Mical - oxidized and unoxidized ANP - F - actin yielded the same cross - linking patterns . Co - sedimentation with human cofilin - 1 and gel analysis was performed as described above . In vivo data Expression analysis , F - actin organization , and bristle cell remodeling was examined and quantified as described 12 , 14 . Embryos were collected , processed , staged , dissected , and analyzed for axon guidance defects using an antibody to Fasciclin II ( 1 : 4 , 1D4 supernatant 67 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) as described 19 , 44 , 55 , 68 . Males and females of Drosophila embryos , pupae , and adults were used . Statistics and reproducibility For each representative image , gel , immunoblot , graph , movie , or in vivo experiment , the experiments were repeated at least two separate independent times and there were no limitations in repeatability . At least two independent protein purifications and multiple independent actin biochemical experiments were performed with similar results including reproducing the effects in Fig . 1b and Fig . 1g – h independently in both of our labs using non - overlapping / independent sets of reagents . No statistical method was used to predetermine the sample size , which was based on what is published in the field . Differences between experimental and control animal conditions were large , with little variability – and so the sample size was larger than needed to ensure adequate power to detect an effect . Animal studies were based on pre - established criteria to compare against age - matched animals . Animal experiments were not randomized . Animals of the correct genotype were determined and those collected of that genotype were included as data . For genetic experiments , in which the genotype needed to be determined based on different Drosophila genetic / chromosome markers , blinding was not employed . The figure legends list the sample size for each experiment . To the best of our knowledge the statistical tests are justified as appropriate . No cell lines were used in this study .

Mical / F - actin dynamics are modulated by cofilin ( a ) Mical ( 1 ) physically associates with its substrate F - actin ( 2 ) , which triggers Mical’s conversion / consumption of its co - enzyme NADPH to NADP + ( 3 ) . Mical then oxidizes F - actin subunits on their M44 and M47 residues ( 4 ) triggering F - actin disassembly . For simplicity , the presence of molecular oxygen ( O 2 ) and flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) have been excluded from this diagram .

This antibody recognizes Mical - treated actin but not untreated actin or Mical - treated actin following incubation with SelR , a reductase enzyme that reverses Mical - mediated actin oxidation 14 . SelR C124S is an enzymatically - dead version of SelR that does not reduce Mical - oxidized actin 14 . Specifically , 2 . 3μM of actin ( Drosophila actin 5C ) was polymerized with either 600nM Mical alone ( untreated actin ) or 600nM Mical / 100μM NADPH ( Mical - treated actin ) for 1 hour at room temperature . Mical - treated actin was then incubated with 2 . 4μM of SelR or 2 . 4μM of SelR C124S and samples were subjected to SDS - PAGE and Western blotting with the actin MetO - 44 antibody ( see also Supplementary Fig . 2d ) .

Pyrene - actin and cosedimentation ( insets , a – b ) assays show that purified Mical - oxidized actin ( ox - actin ) does not polymerize at 1 . 1μM ( a ; see also 13 , 14 ) , but does polymerize to increasing levels when at concentrations of 2 . 2μM and 4 . 4μM ( b – c ) .

Unoxidized Cy3 - F - actin seeds were introduced on the slide surface ( red filaments , unoxidized ) and extended with 100 % Mical oxidized actin ( ox - actin ) labeled with Alexa488 ( green stretches , oxidized ) . Addition of 10 nM human cofilin - 1 ( but not buffer ) to such filaments resulted in full dismantling of Mical ox - actin stretches ( green ) within the mixing time ( ~ 30 sec ) , but unoxidized actin ( red stretches ) was not disassembled and stayed on the surface ( bottom panel ) .

Increasing the levels of PlexA in combination with Mical in neurons ( Neuronal PlexA [ PlexA + + + ] and Neuronal Mical [ Mical + + + ] ) alters the pathfinding of these longitudinal axons ( e . g . , arrow , arrowhead ) and creates a sensitive genetic background to quantify CNS axonal pathfinding defects including discontinuous or missing 1 st , 2 nd , or 3rd CNS longitudinals and / or axons crossing the midline ( see also 14 , 53 – 55 ) .
