letter 60 nature genetics • volume 31 • may 2002 Fig . 1 Data set on the experimentally established genetic interactions in yeast . The graph shows causal rela - tions among the 52 interregulatory genes . To indicate downstream causality ( top arrow ) , genes lacking a known regulator other than mutual or self - regulation are listed in the left column . The other genes are then placed in the leftmost column so that all of their regulators locate to their left . Following the same rule , above are shown the numbers of nonregula - tory genes ( names omitted ) regulated by genes from each column . From left to right , downstream causation emphasizes the consequences of altering a gene’s activity for other genes . From right to left , upstream causation reveals the sources of a gene’s perturbation . Bold type indi - cates self - activation , bold italics indi - cates self - inhibition and borders indicate essential genes . Thick lines represent activation , thin lines repre - sent inhibition and the dashed gray line represents dual regulation .

Interpretation of high - throughput biological data requires a knowledge of the design principles underlying the networks that sustain cellular functions . Of particular importance is the genetic network , a set of genes that interact through directed transcriptional regulation . Genes that exert a regu - latory role encode dedicated transcription factors ( hereafter referred to as regulating proteins ) that can bind to specific DNA control regions of regulated genes to activate or inhibit their transcription . Regulated genes may themselves act in a regulatory manner , in which case they participate in a causal pathway . Looping pathways form feedback circuits . Because a gene can have several connections , circuits and pathways may crosslink and thus represent connected components . We have created a graph of 909 genetically or biochemically established interactions among 491 yeast genes . The number of regulating proteins per regulated gene has a narrow distri - bution with an exponential decay . The number of regulated genes per regulating protein has a broader distribution with a decay resembling a power law . Assuming in computer - generated graphs that gene connections fulfill these distrib - utions but are otherwise random , the local clustering of con - nections and the number of short feedback circuits are largely underestimated . This deviation from randomness probably reflects functional constraints that include biosyn - thetic cost , response delay and differentiative and homeosta - tic regulation . In integrating genome - wide data on transcript abundance 1 into a dynamic view of gene networks , recent studies have focused on abstracting the principles that underlie the architecture and causal interplay of these networks . At present , the yeast Saccha - romyces cerevisiae is the most suitable eukaryotic organism for achieving this goal , as much information about its transcrip - tional regulations has been accumulated 2 , 3 . Of roughly 6 , 000 yeast genes , 124 have been shown through genetic and biochemi - cal experiments to encode regulating proteins that can inﬂuence the expression of speciﬁc genes 2 . These data were obtained from a previous review 2 and were validated and updated , until July 2001 , by manual inspection of the websites of MIPS , SwissProt , Yeast Protein Database , S . cerevisiae Promoter Database and the Saccharomyces Genome Database ( see Web Note A online ) . The elements of the general transcription initiation machinery were excluded from this study , although some have differential roles in transcription of large subsets of genes 3 . Some of the 124 regula - tory genes transcriptionally control a set of 367 non - regulatory genes ( Fig . 1 ) through 837 connections ( see Web Table A online ) . Of the 124 regulatory genes , 52 interact with themselves or with other regulatory genes through 72 additional links ( see Web Table A online ) . A transcriptional regulatory network can thus be represented as a graph where vertices are genes and directed edges denote activating or repressing effects on transcription . The graph of these 52 ’interregulatory’ genes comprises mainly several small disconnected components ( Fig . 1 ) . Published online : 22 April 2002 , DOI : 10 . 1038 / ng873 © 2002 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / g e n e t i cs . n a t u r e . c o m Most networks fall into two major categories on the basis of their connectivity distribution , p k , which represents the proba - bility that a vertex in the network is connected to k other ver - tices . One category of networks is characterized by a p k that peaks at an average k mean and decays exponentially for large k 4 , 5 . In these exponential networks , most vertices have approx - imately the same number of links . By contrast , metabolic path - ways 6 − 8 belong to a category of nonhomogeneous networks , where p k decays as a power law . As the connections are inher - ently oriented in a transcriptional regulatory network , we sep - arately analyzed the number of regulating proteins per regulated gene ( arriving connectivity ) and the number of reg - ulated genes per regulating protein ( departing connectivity ) , to determine whether they were best described by the expo - nential or power - law models . The arriving connectivity of the yeast network has an expo - nential distribution , with 93 % of the genes being regulated by 1 − 4 regulating proteins ( Fig . 2 a ) . The probability p k that a given target gene is regulated by k regulating proteins decreases roughly as C e −β k ( C is a constant ) , with β∼ 0 . 45 for both the total set of regulated genes and its interregulatory subset . The avail - able data for Escherichia coli 9 are compatible with an exponen - tial distribution of arriving connections , with β∼ 1 . 2 ; this higher β coefﬁcient means that fewer targets have many regulators . This coefﬁcient thus reﬂects the molecular limits on the number of regulating proteins that can combinatorially exert an effect on the target gene expression . Consequently , lower coefﬁcients are predicted for multicellular organisms with a more sophisticated genetic regulatory machinery . The departing connectivity of the yeast network does not seem to be distributed according to an exponential law ( Fig . 2 b ) . It ﬁts better a power law , although there are insufﬁcient data to rule out other possibilities . The probability p k that a given regu - lating protein regulates k target genes decreases as approxi - mately C k −γ , with γ∼ 1 for both the global set of 124 regulatory proteins and its interregulatory subset . For E . coli as well , γ∼ 1 ( our best ﬁt computed from ref . 9 ; see also refs 8 , 10 ) . Because γ∼ 1 , the number of departing connections ( kp k ∼ k C k – 1 = C ) is distributed almost equally over k , unlike the connections pre - sent in metabolic networks ( γ∼ 1 . 5 – 3 ) 6 − 8 . Thus , bacterial and fungal genetic networks are free of a characteristic scale with respect to the distributions of both regulating proteins and departing connections . The differing distribution laws for arriving and departing con - nectivities suggests that there is a correlation between them . A joint distribution ( Fig . 2 c ) shows that genes with few regulators also tend to have few targets . Because there are many such genes , inactivating a gene selected at random has a low probability of altering the pathway structure of other genes . In contrast , inacti - vating one of the few highly connected genes would greatly decrease the communication between the remaining genes 11 and could be lethal . Of 124 regulatory genes , 10 are essential , includ - ing 6 interregulatory genes that tend to be located upstream in the causal graph ( Fig . 1 ) . Indeed , their overall inﬂuence ( direct and indirect targets ) is twice as big on average as that of nonessential genes . To evaluate the generality of the predicted topology , two things must be determined : ( i ) to what extent the present compilation differs from a complete yeast data set and ( ii ) whether the observed global topology is likely to hold true as more data accu - mulate . On the basis of sequence homology , at most , 77 addi - tional yeast genes encode putative regulating proteins ( see Web Note A online ) ; however , recent work has investigated the genome - wide locations of 12 DNA - binding proteins , using chro - matin immunoprecipitation and microarrays 12 − 15 . Depending on the laboratory , the number of targets thus obtained is on aver - age 3 . 5 - fold 12 , 15 and 26 - fold 13 , 14 greater than the number found here for the same regulators ( see Web Table A online ) . Although the exact number of targets depends on a somewhat arbitrary threshold , it is already clear that this new method has the poten - tial to reveal many unsuspected links 12 − 15 . It is therefore essential to re - evaluate the topology of the yeast network once a sufﬁcient set of regulatory genes has been studied with this genome - wide approach and universal threshold deﬁnitions . Moreover , theoret - ical considerations , consistent with the comparison of a subset to the whole set ( Fig . 2 a , b ) , suggest a way in which future data may affect the described network structure . If departing connectivity is free of a characteristic scale , future data should presumably not alter the power - law parameters . If arriving connectivity is shaped by the sophistication of the regulatory machinery , additional data would probably increase C while maintaining β . letter nature genetics • volume 31 • may 2002 61 Fig . 2 Connectivity of the yeast genetic network . a , Arriving connectivity dis - tribution ( semi - log plot ) . The number of regulating proteins per regulated gene follows an exponential distribution ( least - square method ) both for all 402 regulated genes ( 367 nonregulatory and 35 interregulatory genes  17 interregulatory genes are excluded because they lack a known regulator ; 909 connections ; open squares , full line ; p k = 157e – 0 . 45 k ; R = 0 . 99 ) and for the subset of 35 interregulatory genes ( 72 connections ; filled circles , broken line ; p k = 15e – 0 . 43 k ; R = 0 . 94 ) . b , Departing connectivity distribution ( log / log plot ) . The number of regulated genes per regulating protein better fits a power - law distribution both for all 124 regulating proteins ( 909 connections ; open squares , full line ; P k = 23 k − 0 . 87 ; R = 0 . 95 ) and for its subset of 37 regulating pro - teins that control regulatory genes ( 72 connections ; filled circles , broken line ; P k = 19 k − 1 . 14 ; R = 0 . 99 ) . Opposite views ( a versus b ; exponential departing and power - law arriving connectivities ) would give lower correlation coeffi - cients ( R = 0 . 88 , 0 . 91 , 0 . 83 and 0 . 98 , respectively ) and very different slopes for global versus interregulatory genes . Null values were discarded . c , Joint dis - tributions . The probability that a randomly chosen gene has in arriving and out departing connections is distributed on this linear plot as a function of in ( regulating proteins ) and out ( regulated genes ) . a b c © 2002 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / g e n e t i cs . n a t u r e . c o m To assess how accurately various models represent the biologi - cal situation , the actual yeast genetic network ( a ) was compared with directed random graphs modeled under three assumptions ( see Web Note B online and Fig . 2 ) : the connectivity distribu - tions conform with ( b ) the empirical data ( c ) the laws deduced in Fig . 2 and ( d ) a Poisson law . A uniformly distributed connectivity ( d ) favors the emergence of a connected component that com - prises the majority of the genes ( Table 1 ) , which is not observed . By contrast , both random graphs with constrained connectivity distributions ( b or c ; Fig . 2 ) reasonably approximate the average number of neighbors one or two steps away . At a more reﬁned grain , however , they are no longer acceptable approximations . The local attribution of a few edges per vertex in a sparse graph is an important parameter that affects the network dynamics . It could be uniform , as in random graphs 4 , or highly clustered , as in small worlds 5 ; extreme local clustering would result in global fragmentation , unlike small worlds , which still retain large con - nected components . Global fragmentation is observed ( Fig . 1 ) , beyond that expected from the empirical data or the deduced laws ( b or c ; Table 1 ) . A clustering coefﬁcient has been proposed to quantify the propensity of the links reaching an individual to involve him or her in local social interactions within ‘cliques’ 5 . Because genetic networks are directed , we introduce the notion of upstream or downstream ‘semi - cliquishness’ ( see Web Note B online ) . The corresponding semi - clustering coefﬁcients are approximately ﬁvefold higher than those expected for the yeast network in a constrained random graph ( Table 1 ) . Along the same lines , the total number of observed feedback circuits is ﬁve - fold higher than that predicted by ( b ) or ( c ) , and 14 - fold higher for single - gene circuits ( Table 1 ) . These circuits are crucial to the dynamics of the system . Positive circuits comprise an even number of inhibitory interactions and contribute to multistationarity , whereas negative circuits com - prise an odd number of inhibitory interactions and contribute to homeostasis 16 . In this view , higher organisms are expected to rely more heavily than lower ones on positive circuits , particularly to achieve cellular differentiation , with each cell type corresponding to one of several stationary states . We observed ﬁve negative and six positive circuits in 52 yeast interregulatory genes ( Fig . 1 ) . As expected , this is in marked contrast to the genes of E . coli , where 45 circuits ( 39 negative , 3 positive , 3 dual ) were observed for 55 interregulatory genes 9 . Yeast positive circuits control switching processes , such as those leading to pseudohyphal growth ( YJL110C / YKR034W , controlled by YER040W ) 17 , sporulation ( YJR094C ) 18 or multiple - drug resistance ( YBL005W ) 19 . Negative circuits are constituted by ( self - ) inhibitors that ﬁnely control responses to the absence of glu - cose ( YGL035C ) 20 , DNA dam - age ( YLR176C ) 21 or oxygen ( YPR065W ) 22 . As a whole , the yeast tran - scriptional regulatory net - work combines a small maximal diameter , an elevated local semi - clustering , a high number of feedback circuits and a global fragmentation . This departure from a random distribution must reflect func - tional constraints . Indeed , each small connected piece implements a biological func - tion , and the global fragmen - tation may serve to limit inter - functional crosstalk at the transcriptional level . The ele - vated clustering and feedback content probably implement dif - ferentiative and homeostatic requirements . Single - gene feedback circuits are predominant ( this study and ref . 9 ) and may have been selected through evolution for several reasons : ( i ) they decrease the biosynthetic cost ( roughly proportional to the amount of transcripts and proteins to be produced ) , ( ii ) together with the small diameter , they reduce the response delay ( often a consequence of macromolecular synthesis ) and ( iii ) they stabilize the ﬂuctuations of expression of the involved genes 23 . Similar laws seem to govern the local and global net - work topologies in eukaryotes and prokaryotes , notwithstand - ing the circuit sign . When prior knowledge of the speciﬁc transcriptional connections is limited , these laws may prove general enough to facilitate the integration of transcriptomic data into dynamic models of genetic networks .
