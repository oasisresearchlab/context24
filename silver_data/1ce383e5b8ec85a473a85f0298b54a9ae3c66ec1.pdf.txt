Cdk1 was engineered to accept an ATP analog that allows it to uniquely label its substrates with a bio - orthogonal phosphate analog tag . A highly speciﬁc , covalent capture - and - release methodology was developed for rapid puriﬁcation of tagged peptides derived from labeled substrate proteins . Applica - tion of this approach to the discovery of Cdk1 - cyclin B substrates yielded identiﬁcation of > 70 substrates and phosphorylation sites . Many of these sites are known to be phosphorylated in vivo , but most of the proteins have not been characterized as Cdk1 - cyclin B substrates . This approach has the potential to expand our under - standing of kinase – substrate connections in signaling networks . chemical biology (cid:2) chemical genetics (cid:2) cyclin - dependent (cid:2) phosphorylation (cid:2) signaling P rotein kinases regulate a vast array of biological processes through phosphorylation of protein substrates . A comprehen - sive map of all phosphorylation sites and kinase – substrate pairs would greatly facilitate the study of signaling networks . This goal facestwofundamentalchallenges . First , allproteinkinasesuseATP as a cofactor to phosphorylate their targets , and thus the direct substrates of a single kinase cannot be easily traced in protein mixtures containing multiple kinases . Second , phosphorylation often occurs at low stoichiometry and on low - abundance proteins . This makes substrate and phosphorylation site identification very challenging . Powerful methods have been developed to address these dual problems ( 1 , 2 ) . Kinase – substrate pairs can be tested in multiplexed phosphorylation assays by using immobilized arrays of purified proteins . These high - throughput chip - based assays have the added benefit of presenting low - abundance proteins at easily detectable levels and have provided a first - generation map of protein phosphorylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( 3 ) . However , theseassaysdonotcurrentlyallowidentificationofphosphorylationsitesandhavenotbeenadaptedtoorganismswithmorecomplexproteomes . Prediction of high - likelihood kinase substrates can sometimes be achieved by using knowledge of the substrate se - quence motif preferences of individual kinases , but only when these preferences are strong ( 4 , 5 ) . Finally , thousands of in vivo phos - phorylation sites from metazoan organisms have been identified in proteomic screens ( 6 – 9 ) , but for most of these sites the responsible upstream kinases remain unknown . We have demonstrated a chemical and genetic solution to the common use of ATP by all kinases . Our approach relies on engineering a kinase to accept unnatural ATP analogs by modifi - cation of the ATP - binding pocket ( 10 , 11 ) . The analogs are very poor substrates for wild - type kinases ; thus , an analog - sensitive kinase ( or as - kinase ) can be used to specifically radiolabel its substrates in cell extracts while preserving important aspects of biological context , such as the integrity of protein complexes . Coupling this approach with the use of libraries of genetically encoded affinity - tagged proteins has facilitated identification of low - abundance S . cerevisiae Cdk1 and Pho85 substrate proteins ( 12 , 13 ) . However , this approach is not currently tractable in organisms where genetic libraries present technical limits . Also , precise phos - phorylation sites are not readily determined by this approach , because proteins are purified by virtue of a protein tag rather than a phospho - dependent tagging strategy . Here , we report a method in which the as - kinase uses a ATP analog to deliver a chemical tag to its substrates , obviating the need to genetically pretag candidate substrates . The ATP analog con - tains two distinct modifications . Prior work has demonstrated that modification of the adenine moiety allows unique binding to an engineered kinase of interest ( Fig . 1 A ) . A second modification is made at the (cid:1) - phosphate of ATP , generating the kinase - transferable tag . The tag is a unique phosphate mimetic ( thiophos - phate ) that we have found can be chemically distinguished from all other functional groups in the proteome by using selective chem - istry . We developed a catch - and - release strategy to purify tagged peptides derived from digests of labeled protein mixtures . Mass spectrometric analysis revealed the identity of the corresponding protein species and the location of the phosphorylation site ( s ) . To demonstratetheutilityofthismethod , weappliedittothediscovery of substrates of the human kinase Cdk1 - cyclin B , a kinase critical for imposition and maintenance of the mitotic state , with cell extracts and purified nuclear envelope as target materials . Numer - ous phosphorylation sites in candidate substrates were identified , and many known Cdk substrates . Results and Discussion Chemistry - Based Purification of Thiophosphorylated Peptides . We and others have developed strategies for the capture of thiophos - phorylated species ( 14 , 15 ) . These strategies rely on the nucleophi - licity of the thiophosphate group , which can be modified by reaction with sulfur - selective electrophilic reagents . The key challenge is to distinguish between thiophosphate and other thiol nucleophiles , for example , cysteine . Given the abundance of cysteine , these groups must be distinguished with extremely high fidelity . The divergent ionization constants of cysteine and thiophosphate have been used to preferentially derivatize thiophosphate in the presence of cys - teine . However , the moderate difference in pK a makes it very challenging to specifically isolate thiophosphate groups in the presence of a vast excess of cysteine nucleophiles , as in complex protein mixtures . Here , we report a selective chemistry - based purification method Author contributions : J . D . B . , D . O . M . , and K . M . S . designed research ; J . D . B . performed research ; J . D .

This approach relies on the fact that thiophos - phate and cysteine form qualitatively different products on alkyla - tion . These can subsequently be distinguished with total specificity in a second chemical step . This approach is conceptually analogous to the method of Aebersold and colleagues for purification of phosphopeptides ( 42 ) . Our approach is detailed in Fig . 1 B . A protein mixture containing tagged substrates is digested to peptides , separating the majority of thiophosphate tags from cysteine . The peptide mixture is incubated with iodoacetyl - agarose resin , resulting in covalent capture of taggedpeptidesandpeptidescontainingcysteine . Cysteinereactsto form thioether linkages , whereas tagged peptides form a chemically distinct phosphate diester . This diester linkage is normally quite stable but it can be made to rapidly hydrolyze by oxidation of the sulfur atom ( 16 , 17 ) . The resin is treated with the peroxide agent Oxone , resulting in oxidation of all sulfur atoms present ( thiophos - phate , cysteine , and methionine ) . The thiophosphate linkages spontaneously hydrolyze , releasing phosphopeptides , whereas the thioether linkages , although oxidized , remain stable ( 18 , 19 ) . Thus , tagged peptides are rapidly and specifically eluted . To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of this purification strategy we tested its ability to recover a tagged peptide from simple and highly complex peptide mixtures . For the simple case , purified model Cdk substrate S . cerevisiae Fin1 ( 20 ) was thiophosphorylated at a single site with human Cdk2 - cyclin A . After digestion , 10 pmol were subjected to purification , and samples of the load , flow - through , and eluate were analyzed by MALDI - TOF mass spec - trometry ( Fig . 2 A ) . The unbound material showed specific deple - tion of the tagged peptide ( [ M (cid:1) H ] (cid:1) (cid:2) 2 , 122 . 00 ) , indicating its retention on the beads . Analysis of the eluate showed efficient recovery of the tagged peptide , now present as the phosphopeptide analog ( [ M (cid:1) H ] (cid:1) (cid:2) 2 , 106 . 02 ) because of replacement of the sulfur atom with oxygen . Next , weevaluatedourabilitytorecoverthistaggedpeptidefrom a whole - cell extract digest ( Fig . 2 B ) . Ten picomoles of tagged peptide were added to a tryptic digest of 10 mg of Jurkat T cell extract . The tagged peptide species comprised approximately one part in 500 , 000 by mass . The mixture was subjected to our purifi - cation , and the eluate was analyzed by MALDI - TOF . Although some weak background peaks were present , the expected phos - phopeptide dominated the spectrum , indicating highly specific recovery of the tagged peptide . A generalized thiophosphopeptide purification protocol is presented in supporting information ( SI ) Fig . 6 . Specific Labeling of Cdk Substrates by Using N 6 - ( benzyl ) ATP - (cid:1) - S . The most stringent test of an affinity enrichment method for substrate identification is its application to a kinase with hundreds of low - abundance substrates . We chose the Cdks as a test case because of the wide variety of critical cell - cycle events they coordinate and the likelihood that many of their substrates would be difficult to detect without enrichment . Human Cdk – cyclin complexes bearing the analog - sensitizing mutation F80G ( as - Cdks ) are capable of using a radiolabeled version of our ATP analog [ N 6 - ( benzyl ) ATP - (cid:1) - 35 S ] to label endog - enoussubstratesincellextractswithhighspecificity ( Fig . 3 A ) . Inthe absence of as - kinase , background labeling was very low , indicating minimal usage of the analog by endogenous enzymes . Many of the substrates are labeled by individual Cdk – cyclin complexes , or shared between pairs of complexes , indicating substrate specificity contributions from the Cdk and the cyclin partner ( 21 ) . Higher - resolution mapping using 2D gels revealed labeling of hundreds of proteins by Cdk1 - cyclin B ( Fig . 3 B ) . To determine which Cdk1 - cyclin B substrates were abundant enough to be identified by analysisofexcisedgelspots , thesilver - stained2Dgelsweredigitized and overlaid on the autoradiographic data ( SI Fig . 7 ) . We found minimal correspondence between the radiolabeled and silver - stained species , indicating labeled isoforms were present at mostly subnanogram levels , below the limits of protein identification methods . These experiments validate Cdk1 - cyclinB as a stringent test case for any kinase substrate identification method because the number of direct substrates is large , and their varied and often low abundance is a challenge to traditional separation methodologies . Identification of Cdk1 - Cyclin B Substrates and Their Phosphorylation Sites in Cell Extracts . We next pursued identification of Cdk1 - cyclinB substrates in HeLa cell extracts . To reduce sample com - plexity , we separated the lysates into five fractions by ammonium sulfate fractionation . Purified recombinant as - Cdk1 - cyclin B and N 6 - ( benzyl ) ATP - (cid:1) - S were added to cell lysate fractions , and then thiophosphopeptides produced by trypsinolysis were specifically recovered by using our purification methodology . The recovered peptides were analyzed by nanoscale liquid chromatography cou - pled to a Q TRAP tandem mass spectrometer . Peptide fragmen - tation data were interpreted by using MASCOT ( 22 ) and verified by manual inspection . Searches considered oxidative modifications . Consistent with expectation , we observed oxidation of methionine to the sulfoxide , rarely to the sulfone , but we never observed the natural form . We never observed peptides containing reduced or oxidized cysteine residues or oxidation of amines or other residues . Although the substantial majority of recovered peptides bore proline - directed phosphorylations consistent with labeling by Cdks , Fig . 1 . Tagging and puriﬁcation of kinase - speciﬁc phosphorylation sites . ( A ) A kinase is engineered to accept an ATP analog bearing a substitution at the N6 amine by mutation of the conserved ‘‘Gatekeeper’’ residue ( as - kinase , for analog - sensitive ) . Replacement of a (cid:1) - phosphoryl oxygen with sulfur gives the ATP analog N 6 - ( benzyl ) ATP - (cid:1) - S , which bears a transferable thiophosphate group . A kinase reaction performed with an as - kinase and N 6 - ( benzyl ) ATP - (cid:1) - S results in speciﬁc tagging of the substrates of this kinase with a thiophosphate group .

We also recovered unmodified peptides from 20 , mostly highly abundant , proteins ( SI Table 3 ) . Eighty - five percent of these were recovered from a single purification , suggesting an incomplete wash step . In total , 72 proline - directed phosphorylation sites were identified in 68 proteins ( Fig . 4 and SI Table 4 ) . The identified proteins are involved in a wide range of cellular functions from cell cycle control to receptor signal transduction . Many of the proteins we identified are known Cdk substrates with biological roles for their phosphor - ylation , confirming that our methodology can rapidly uncover significant biological connections . Examples of proteins in this class include protein phosphatase 1a ( 23 ) , DNA ligase I ( 24 ) , RNA polymerase II ( 25 ) , lamins A / C ( 26 ) and B ( 27 ) , stathmin ( 28 ) , and multiple nucleolar components . In protein phosphatase 1a , which antagonizes mitotic Cdk1 activity by dephosphorylating its sub - strates , the site we found ( T320 ) is known to be phosphorylated by Cdk1 - cyclin B in mitosis , resulting in inhibition of phosphatase activity and thus promotion of the mitotic state ( 23 ) . In lamin A / C we detected phosphorylation of serine 22 and serine 392 , sites required for nuclear envelope disassembly in mitosis ( 26 , 29 ) . Analysis of the functions of the candidate substrates revealed that many are associated with processes or structures known to be regulated by Cdks . For example , we recovered the known Cdk substrates nucleophosmin and nucleolin , nucleolar components involved in production of ribosomes . We also found three sites in the candidate substrate , Treacher Collins syndrome protein ( Trea - cle ) , a nucleolar protein involved in ribosomal DNA gene tran - scription ( 30 ) . Similarly , we uncovered four proteins involved in nucleotide biosynthesis ; two are known Cdk substrates and two are candidate substrates . These results indicate that our discovery method is capable of rapidly identifying biologically relevant con - nections between the target kinase and specific phosphorylation sites in its substrates . Further evidence for the relevance of the candidate Cdk sites comes from the observation that many are phosphorylated in vivo . We compared our results with several large phosphoproteomic datasets ( 6 – 8 ) . Interestingly , at least 36 of our sites , or 50 % , are known to be phosphorylated in vivo in HeLa cells . At least four additional sites are known to be phosphorylated in their mouse homologs ( 9 ) . Our results therefore provide an important link between these sites and a specific kinase , and strongly suggest that our method is capable of uncovering relevant in vivo connections between a kinase and its substrates .

The target species comprised 2 ng or less ; the background was 500 , 000 - fold higher . Analysis of the load ( 2 (cid:2) g , 1 : 5000 ) conﬁrmed that the target species was undetectable under these conditions . After puriﬁcation , analysis of the eluate revealed highly speciﬁc recovery of the target species . Fig . 3 . as - Cdks phosphorylate numerous and varied substrates in cell ex - tracts .

In Vitro Validation of Selected Candidate Substrates . To further confirm that our methodology targets normal Cdk1 substrates and does not alter the kinase’s substrate phosphorylation preferences , we examined the ability of four of the identified proteins to act as substrates for wild - type Cdk1 and natural ATP . These proteins were produced in bacteria , purified , and phosphorylated with Cdk1 - cyclin B and ATP . After digestion with trypsin , phosphopep - tides were enriched by using immobilized iron - affinity chromatog - raphy and analyzed by LC - MS / MS . In every case , we observed phosphorylation of the same site seen in our original substrate discovery experiments , including one site matching only a minimal Cdk consensus ( Table 1 and SI Fig . 8 ) . These results indicate that the engineered kinase / nucleotide pair Cdk1F80G / N 6 B - (cid:1) - S displays the same substrate phosphorylation site preferences as wild - type Cdk1 / ATP . Many Phosphorylation Sites Identified Lack an Optimal Cdk Consensus Sequence . Peptidephosphorylationexperimentshaveshownthatan optimal Cdk phosphorylation consensus sequence consists of a target serine or threonine followed by a proline , with an arginine or lysine residue in the (cid:1) 3 position ( [ ST ] Px [ KR ] ) ( 4 , 31 ) . We found that 68 % of the phosphorylation sites we identified ( 49 of 72 ) occurred in full consensus sequences , whereas the remaining 32 % fell within suboptimal sites containing only the minimal necessary proline feature . Considering only those sites ‘‘known in vivo , ’’ we found approximately the same distribution , with 39 % of sites ( 16 of 41 ) matching only the minimal proline - directed consensus . The abundance of suboptimal sites highlights the challenge inherent in assigning kinase – substrate pairings based on phosphoproteomic data alone ; none of these sites could be inferred to be Cdk1 sites Fig . 4 .

Given the large number of proline - directed kinases , it’s tempting to speculate that such sites may be substrates for multiple kinases , perhaps serving as signal integrators . Indeed , even optimal sites may serve such a function . For example , we found an optimal site in hnRNP - K ( S216 ) that was determined to be phosphorylated by JNK ( 32 ) . Phosphorylation of this site along with S353 was found to increase the transcriptional activity of hnRNPk from AP1 - bearing promoters . We speculate that Cdk1 - cyclin B activity may similarly regulate this protein . Identification of Cdk1 - Cyclin B Substrates in Purified Nuclear Enve - lope . We next sought to evaluate the utility of our method for the discoveryofkinasesubstratesinpurifiedsubcellularcompartments . This approach serves to greatly enrich a subset of the proteome while preserving the structural context of the enriched proteins . We chose to focus on the nuclear envelope . Mitotic disassembly of the nuclear lamina and of the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) are known to be imposed in large part by Cdk activity ( 33 , 34 ) . Rat liver nuclei were prepared as described in ref . 35 and nuclear envelope was prepared by DNase / RNase digestion followed by heparin treatment as described in ref . 36 . This material contains the nuclear membrane , transmembrane and tightly associated proteins , and the NPC . Purified recombinant as - Cdk1 - cyclin B and N 6 B - (cid:1) - S were added to the preparation ; three experiments were performed and recovered phosphopeptides were analyzed by LC - MS / MS . We recovered 20 phosphorylation sites on 11 proteins ( Fig . 5 ) . Confirming identifications in the larger screen , we identified known Cdk1phosphorylationsitesinthenuclearlaminaconstituentslaminA / C and B . We also identified sites on three transmembrane proteins that associate directly with the lamin network : Lap1 , Lap2B , and MAN1 . Lap1 and Lap2 are believed to be involved in assembly of the nuclear lamina , and mitotic phosphorylation of Lap2B is known to abrogate binding to lamin B and to chromo - somes ( reviewed in ref . 34 ) . We also identified phosphorylation sites within constituents of the NPC ( Nup53 , Nup133 , and Nup358 ) and in the nucleoplasmic domains of the three transmembrane proteins ( gp210 , POM121 , andNDC1 ) that assembleand / or anchor the NPC into the nuclear membrane ( 37 ) . Nup53 is known to tightly associate with the nuclear envelope and lamin B and may bind to the NPC assembly protein NDC1 ( 37 , 38 ) . It is also the vertebrate ortholog of yeast Nup53p , a known Cdk1 / Cdc28 target ( 39 ) . These resultsindicatethatwewereabletorecapitulatediscoveryofknownCdk1targetsinthenuclearenvelopeandtodiscovercandidate targets known to be regulated by mitotic phosphorylation . Advantages and Limitations of the Method . Although our substrate discovery technology allowed us to uncover numerous known Cdk1 substrates and candidates in our initial screen , it also missed a number of known substrates , in particular , low - abundance proteins such as transcription factors . Because our model thiophosphopep - tide experiments indicate that our purification process can recover a target peptide from a 500 , 000 - fold excess of background , we believe these false negatives result primarily from the broad dy - namic range of cellular proteins , as well as difficulty in achieving high - stoichiometry phosphorylation in cell extracts . The compre - hensive identification of substrates is therefore likely to require measures such as an increase in experimental scale , further frac - tionation of extracts , or increased focus on purified subcellular compartments . Tagged peptides with cysteine residues are not recoverable with our method . To asses the resulting loss of coverage , we conducted in silico digests of the human proteome and asked what fraction of the resulting peptides contained cysteine . For relevance to mass spectrometric analysis , we considered only those peptides between 7 and 25 residues in length . For trypsin , 24 . 5 % of the peptides contained cysteine ( SI Table 5 ) . In practice this loss could be largely mitigatedbyconductingparalleldigestswithtwoormoreproteases . Hydrolysis of the thiophosphate linkages to the beads converts these peptides to ordinary phosphopeptides . Although our enrich - ment technique is extremely specific for tagged peptides , it would be ideal to have a unique identifier that remains covalently attached to the phosphopeptide beyond this step . One way of accomplishing this is to conduct the hydrolytic release of the captured tagged peptides in 18 O - labeled water ( demonstrated in SI Fig . 9 ) , which results in the liberated phosphopeptide bearing an isotopically labeled phosphate . Alternatively , a nucleotide analog bearing one or two isotopically labeled oxygen atoms in the transferred thiophosphate could be used ( SI Fig . 10 ) . We have recently reported a method for identification of as - kinase targets by using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a chemically derivatized thiophosphorylation adduct ( 14 , 43 ) . Al - though the antibody - based approach does not immediately identify the phosphorylation site targeted by an as - kinase , it is complemen - tary to the method reported here because it leads to purification of the entire substrate protein . This allows multiple substrate tryptic peptides from the same protein to be analyzed , and is not influenced by the presence cysteines near the phosphorylation site . The capture - and - release kinase substrate identification method provides a means of rapidly determining connections between an individual kinase and candidate substrates , at amino acid level resolution . Critically , candidates can be identified in extremely complex protein mixtures that preserve important features of biological context . The method provides a potentially powerful strategyfordecipheringtheconnectionsbetweenindividualprotein kinases and their substrates in signaling networks , and provides a complementary approach to large - scale phosphoproteomic studies .

Extract fractions ( 0 . 1 – 1 mg ) were labeled by addition of puriﬁed recombinant as - Cdk1 - cyclin B to 1 % by mass of total protein , 1 mM N 6 - ( benzyl ) ATP - (cid:1) - phosphorothioate , and5mMMgCl 2 . After30minoflabeling , the reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA and then digested with trypsin . Thiophosphopeptideswererecoveredbyusingourpuriﬁcationmethodology , as described for the model thiophosphopeptide experiments . The recovered pep - tides were analyzed by nanoscale LC - MS / MS . Proteins and phosphorylation sites identiﬁed over the course of several experiments were combined in a Microsoft Access database . LC - MS / MS Analysis . Phosphopeptide samples puriﬁed from HeLa extract frac - tionswereanalyzedbynanoscaleliquidchromatographycoupledon - linetoaQ Trap tandem mass spectrometer ( Sciex ) . The peptides were separated over the course of 100 min by using a nonlinear gradient of 5 % to 30 % acetonitrile containing 0 . 1 % formic acid , at a ﬂow rate of 150 nl / min . A 75 (cid:2) m i . d . by 15 cm RP column ( LC Packings ) was used to resolve peptides , and an upstream trap column was used to facilitate sample concentration and transfer from the au - tosampler . Survey scans were performed by using the ‘‘Enhanced MultiCharge’’ mode . Neutral loss survey scans targeting loss of phosphate were occasionally used . Fragmentation spectra were acquired automatically in information - dependent acquisition ( IDA ) mode and interpreted both manually and with MASCOT ( Matrix Science ) . DatabaseSearching . MSdataﬁlesweresearchedagainsttheUniprotandNCBInr databases by using MASCOT . First - pass searches considered one missed cut and oxidation of methionine to the sulfoxide or sulfone , and phosphorylation of serineorthreonine . Furthersearchesconsideredtwomissedcuts , thepresenceof one nontryptic end , and rarer modiﬁcations such pyroglutamic acid formation . Peptides with MASCOT expect scores of (cid:5) 0 . 05 were included ; most of the reported hits had substantially better scores ( SI Tables 2 – 4 ) . InVitroPhosphorylation Assays . ORFsencodingDrp1andTPX2werepurchased as Ultimate ORF Gateway vectors ( Invitrogen ) and shuttled into the bacterial expression vector pDest17 by site - speciﬁc recombination . pDest17 encodes an in - frameN - terminal6xHistag . ORFsencodingHuRandhnRNP - kwerepurchased ascDNAs ( Invitrogen ) andclonedintopDONR221byPCR - mediatedincorporation of terminal recombination sequences , followed by recombination . The ORFs were then shuttled into pDEST17 by recombination . All four proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS ( Novagen ) , and puriﬁed by IDA - Cobalt afﬁnity chromatography . Five micrograms of each puriﬁed protein were labeled with 20 ng of Cdk1 - cyclin B and 100 mM ATP for 30 min , then reactions were stopped with 5 mM EDTA and digested . Phosphopeptides were enrichedbyusingimmobilizediron ( Phos - Selectbeads ; Sigma ) , elutedwithEDTA , and analyzed by nanoscale LC - MS / MS using the QTrap instrument . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS .
