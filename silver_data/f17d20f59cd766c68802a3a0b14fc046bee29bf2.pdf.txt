Counterventions : a reparative reflection on interventionist HCI A reparative reflection on interventionist HCI Rua M . Williams Louanne E . Boyd Juan E .

To disrupt this normalizing drive in HCI , we defne a “counterventional approach” to intervention technology design informed by critical scholarship and community perspec - tives . This approach is meant to unsettle normative assumptions of intervention as urgent , necessary , and curative . We begin with a historical overview of intervention in HCI and its critics . Then , through reparative readings of past HCI projects in autism inter - vention , we illustrate the emergent principles of a counterventional approach and how it may manifest research outcomes that are fun - damentally divergent from dominant approaches . We then explicate characteristics of “counterventions” – projects that aim to contest dominant sociotechnical paradigms through privileging commu - nity and participants in research inquiry , interaction design , and analysis of outcomes . These divergent research imaginaries have transformative implications for how interventionist HCI might be conducted in future .

Alongside this rich tradition of HCI research , the ACM has long had a clinical interven - tionist relation to disabled people as technology users . Some of the earliest ACM publications relating to disability investigate simula - tions of logistical operations in the care and handling of patients in residential facilities [ 26 , 27 , 32 ] . SIGACCESS ( emerging from the SIG for Computers and the Physically Handicapped founded in 1973 ) primarily focuses on the educational and professional access of disabled people to and through technology . Though there are several works which contest the defcit model of disability , ofering ability - based [ 71 ] , agential [ 53 ] , and transformative approaches [ 65 ] , disabled subjects in empirical HCI research predominantly fgure as sites for clinical intervention , especially disabled children who are dually vulnerable by virtue of their disabled and minor status [ 70 ] . Critical Disability Scholars will acknowledge that medical ap - proaches to disabling conditions are often necessary [ 25 ] as ac - cess to medical care and equipment is a matter of concern for many disabled people . However , HCI researchers might also en - gage with work that is critical of interventionist approaches to support progress away from the clinical and managerial handling of disabled bodies [ 61 ] toward equitable and agential technology use for disabled people [ 66 , 67 ] . Eunjung Kim explains that curative projects ( those that seek to restore the sick and injured or to over - come an embodied defcit ) can produce violence when they engage in “the exercise of force to erase diferences for the putative better - ment of the Other” [ 28 : 14 ] . Force in these instances can be overt or covert , but ultimately this depends on a sense of consent violation or coercion of the subject . Bioethicist and disabled activist Joe Stra - mondo explicates and complicates the diference between “curative” and assistive technologies , noting that the distinction between the two can often be fuzzy [ 57 ] . Stramondo encourages researchers to think through the ethical implications of technologies which seek to “restore” a deviant body to an idealized norm . Whether technology is curative or assistive , and whether this experience is desirable or distressing , is an embodied experience . Returning to the specifc domain of human - computer interaction research and technologies for disabled subjects , Mankof et al . [ 31 ] provide a useful exercise in re - evaluating assistive technologies from a Critical Disability Studies lens . They caution against the compulsion for “fxing” and encourage HCI researchers to take a more nuanced , culturally informed , critical approach to disability CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Rua Williams et al . in their work . William & Gilbert [ 66 ] contest that such nuance is not wholly possible in the absence of personal experience – crucial ethical implications of a project may be missed by researchers who do not have the experience of living in the sort of body such technologies are meant to be “for” . As Spiel & Gerling [ 54 ] note in their exploration of games designed for children with ADHD , even in projects designed for fun , the curative can seep in when researchers fail to interrogate and problematize the primacy of the medical gaze . Discomfort with the results of interventionist , medicalized at - titudes toward disability in HCI is not new . Ability - Based Design , frst theorized in 2011 [ 72 ] and reiterated in 2018 [ 71 ] , attempts to reorient researcher and designer perspectives on problem solving in accessible design toward the strengths of disabled users , rather than their defcits . This shifts the frame for problem - solving focus away from using technology to give a capacity the user does not have to enhance a capacity the user excels at . Similarly , Assets - Based design compels designers to shift their attention from defcit to capacity at the community level [ 40 ] . The authors of these design approaches are clear that they are not meant to replace , but to augment existing practices of participation and critical inquiry in design . Participatory method is meant to engage researchers in the re - fection necessary to center the needs of the people over their own assumptions . Many HCI researchers , particularly those in the de - sign space , rely on participatory methods in their work . Emerging from social justice and labor justice eforts in Scandinavia , Participa - tory Design ( PD ) began as a practice of integrating technology into the workplace in a manner that centered the desires and wellbeing of workers [ 59 ] . Gaining popularity in the United States in the mid - 90s during the dot - com bubble [ 34 ] , it is no surprise that PD quickly transformed from a justice - centered practice to the market - centered practices of User - Centered Design and Design Thinking [ 6 ] . By 2010 , Participatory Design was predominately fgured within the ACM as a method of efective innovation , specifcally addressing design dilemmas between tradition and transcendence in the work - place [ 16 ] . As critical inquiry and feminist theory achieved wider accep - tance in HCI in the mid - 2010s [ 7 , 46 ] , more researchers began to conceptualize technology design and adoption as dependent upon human relationality and social systems [ 18 ] . However , PD in HCI , particularly in the United States , remains limited in its capacity for “Real Participation” by institutional conceits of apoliticality and dominant ideologies of race , gender , and class that “exacerbate the difculties of registering marginalized voices” [ 6 : 190 ] . As Harring - ton et al . [ 21 ] illustrate , the popularization of PD in HCI has turned participatory “workshop” practices into a site of simultaneous exclu - sion and extraction and neglects the material realities of oppressed communities in service of neoliberal drives for charity and savior - ism . Similarly , Bennet and Rosner have critiqued design - thinking as a purported user - centered method that inadvertently objectifes its intended participants , especially when those participants are marginalized [ 8 ] . Thus , despite the familiarity with which HCI re - searchers regard participatory method , it is still rare for projects to center participants as respected partners in forming research aims and analyzing outcomes . Gillian Hayes has been an advocate for Action Research in HCI , in which the research outcomes are meant to directly beneft the material conditions of the participant community , with aims and scope democratically vetted by the community itself [ 22 ] . Yet most participatory research in HCI focuses on single - issue design prob - lems and rarely extends participation from those invited to the lab to the broader communities represented by those participants . In as - sistive technology , not only is community - driven Action Research rare , but participation is often limited to the problem - solving phase , rather than invited at the problem - identifcation phase . Sushil Oswal , a blind computer scientist , refects on the absence of disabled perspectives in the full research and production cycle and laments that disabled involvement is often relegated to retroft consultation after - the - fact [ 39 ] . A recent survey of accessibility research in CHI and ASSETS revealed that only 10 % of studies from 1994 - 2019 claimed to use participatory methods , and the fdelity with which participation was representative of disabled community stakeholders was unclear [ 30 ] . Likewise , in a large survey of HCI research related to autism intervention , Spiel et al . found most research in this area “does not acknowledge children’s agency in defning what kinds of technology are appropriate for them” [ 53 : 22 ] . To address the growing tendency of HCI researchers to con - fuse participation in design with participation in research inquiry , Spiel et al . [ 55 ] propose a method for Participatory Evaluation with Autistic Children ( PEACE ) that privileges their desires and curiosi - ties at every stage of the research process . The PEACE method demands researchers engage in conscientious refection and hu - mility . The fundamental premises of PEACE are well suited for other populations with which a researcher may have signifcant diferences in communication and perception . In the same vein , other scholars have recognized participant expressions of subver - sion [ 15 ] and resistance [ 70 ] , as crucial opportunities for refection and re - evaluation of project aims and future work . Participatory Design discourse in HCI traverses broad territory between optimizing sociotechnical products and markets to de - mocratizing design and research inquiry . Friedman [ 19 ] proposes value - sensitive design as an essential approach to making the hid - den and implicit values that drive design and market decisions legible , as well as bringing to the fore the contending and confict - ing values present in the target user - community . Gray & Chivukula [ 20 ] complicate this model through an analysis of practice , noting that design decisions ultimately come down to compromises be - tween existing sociotechnical constraints and ethical values which may be at odds with these circumstances . Bannon et al . [ 3 ] have recently urged HCI practitioners to refect on this contentious terri - tory , warning against an interpretation of PD as a method - in - crisis and instead embrace the emerging criticisms ( such as those from Harrington et al . [ 21 ] , Spiel et al . [ 53 ] , and Williams & Gilbert [ 65 ] ) as essential to PDs evolution and transformation . Ability - based , Assets - based , and other critical Participatory methods share a skepticism toward traditional assumptions and perspectives that unnecessarily constrain our ideas about marginal - ized people . These methods also share a focus inward toward the participant . To truly contest the constraints society has normal - ized in relation to disability , we must look outward , towards the sociotechnical systems that uphold these constraints and evaluate how these narratives infuence our personal identities , ideals , and practices . Among growing concerns about the social impacts of computing research , Hecht et al . [ 23 ] call for reform of the review Counterventions CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany process , explicitly demanding attention to the social consequences of technology to facilitate feld - wide changes in research practice . As mentioned previously , Williams & Gilbert [ 66 ] caution that such attention is not wholly possible without personal connections to the communities most directly impacted . Outside the academy , ac - tivist scholars Liz Jackson and Alex Haagaard have theorized how the lack of communal engagement and an absence sociotechnical fuency of disability leads design teams to produce “Disability Don - gles” – design spectacles that promise a revolutionary accessible new world , but ultimately fail because they were not designed while in disabled communities [ 24 ] . Despite numerous critiques [ 31 , 73 ] , critical refections [ 68 ] , and calls for reform in HCI’s rela - tionship with marginalized people [ 22 , 36 , 40 ] , the question of how to engage researchers in the difcult process of reform remains unanswered . In this paper , we produce a methodological frame for researchers to intentionally engage in practices of self - and peer - transformation required to manifest the ethical research reforms imagined by critical scholars in HCI . To explore this process of personal reform , we evaluate a spe - cifc arc of HCI interventions through “reparative readings” . As described in the following section , reparative readings extend from practices in queer media studies [ 50 ] and are not reparative in the sense of repairing what is broken but of disentangling a legacy of harm such that alternative practices for a more just future may be made legible . Our reparative analysis of this interventionist arc allows us to imagine an alternative approach to HCI interventions in the context of autism . To provide future direction to these alter - natives , we draw upon the broader tradition of counter - narrative to inform a counter - approach to research in HCI and marginalized subjectivities . A counternarrative is a story or argument which challenges a commonly held belief . As an example , Critical Dis - ability Studies is a feld which contests the normative belief that disabled life is inherently undesirable by drawing attention to the toxic cultural assumptions that produce stigmatic and oppressive relations between disabled people and society [ 25 , 38 , 61 ] . Similarly , Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie presents “The danger of a single story” , detailing how the homogeneous white coloniality of literature avail - able to her made it difcult to imagine her own life and the lives of other Africans as real , drawing attention to the power of normative narratives to erase the complexity and multiplicity of lives [ 1 ] . In much of the HCI research for autism , the “single story” is social skills intervention . In the work that follows , we will explore the transformation of the second author’s body of HCI interven - tionist work as it moves from this single story to a plurality of participant - informed possibilities . We then articulate the lessons learned through our reparative readings of interventionist research through counter - narrative as principles for conducting “counter - ventional” research . Just as Ability - based and Assets - based design were intended to augment , and not to replace , user - centered meth - ods , “Counterventions” are simultaneously a practice of critique and generation . We imagine the counterventional approach as a supplement to – and not a substitute or competitor of – partici - patory approaches . We defne “counterventions” as a critical ap - proach to research design that engages with community - informed counterargument in the production of empirical studies that imag - ine alternatives to normative intervention . Further , we understand counterventions as a means to navigate the tensions within disabled embodiment between pride and desire for relief . 2 REPARATIVE READING AS METHOD Previous scholars of HCI have introduced critical analysis from Fem - inist Theory [ 7 ] , Critical Race Theory [ 36 ] , and Queer Theory [ 29 ] . Bardzell’s treatise on Feminist theory in HCI asks how computing researchers can engage in inquiry that actively resists the marginal - ization of women and other oppressed groups in technology design and deployment and suggests critical frames from Feminist Theory which explicitly include historical and social analysis as one oppor - tunity to account for and ameliorate negative impacts [ 5 ] . Light discusses how HCI researchers might engage with Queer Theory and queering in “investigating resistance to the status quo” [ 29 : 430 ] . Ogbonnaya - Ogburu et al . extend the critical frame to directly take up issues of racism and colonialism that surround and are embed - ded within our sociotechnical contexts [ 36 ] . Because so many HCI scholars view themselves as doing socially transformative work , the community has been resistant to critique that the norms in the feld are producing and sustaining harm [ 73 ] . Critical scholars in HCI are often obligated to insert palliative deference to the broader community’s desire and intent to produce social good . Critical analysis is often categorized as paranoid , “a position of alertness to the dangers posed . . . from the world around one” [ 50 : 8 ] . Through a Kleinian positional analysis of examples from queer theory , Eve Kosofsky Sedgewick argues that the critical stance is an oscillatory practice between paranoid or defensive criticism and reparative analysis [ 50 ] . For Sedgewick , paranoid readings are not delusional in the clinical sense , but simply a position or mode of analysis that prioritizes the anticipation of danger and harm . A reparative position , on the other hand , prioritizes comprehension , organization of disparate elements , and integration into some con - duit for action . A reparative position submits to the risk of surprise and the pain of knowing that the past “could have happened dif - ferently from the way it actually did” [ 50 : 25 ] in order to prefgure and act on a more liberatory future . The reparative position is not “merely” aesthetic or reformist [ 50 : 22 ] , nor is it in mutual opposition to the paranoid position , it is a companion process by which we can theorize and enact social change . We are aware of critiques of the reparative method and agree with concerns that a focus on remediation as an ideal outcome makes such readings vulnerable to upholding the neoliberal sys - tems they attempt to address [ 58 ] . The Black Feminist tradition of Reparative Reading focuses the lens of reparation not on remedi - ating systems but on transforming one’s own praxis through the production of a counter - hegemonic love [ 37 ] . In the same spirit , we do not focus our reparative readings at the system of interventionist research itself . Instead , we model reparative readings as a tool for HCI researchers who wish to integrate the knowledge that their work “could have happened diferently from the way it actually did” with a directed sense of alternative actions going forward . Thus , our reparative readings produce a counter - hegemonic guide for counterventions . It is imperative for readers to avoid fxating on connotations of repair and brokenness – reparative readings are not curative in the sense of fxing broken things to some prior CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Rua Williams et al . perfect state , they are transformative in the sense that the practice of reparation produces something altogether diferent . Prior work informed by Critical Disability Studies has demon - strated how cultivating practices of passion and articulation in refection can support scholars eager to make the leap from tra - ditional HCI to critically engaged HCI [ 64 , 68 ] . Building on the momentum of prior critical / paranoid readings of interventionist HCI by disabled scholars ( for example : critiques of wearable com - puting [ 67 ] , of participatory method [ 55 , 65 ] , and of HCI’s general attitude toward disability [ 31 , 66 , 73 ] ) , we now oscillate to the repar - ative position through a retrospective refexive analysis of past interventionist HCI projects . In these analyses , we refect on the undergirding motivations for support and social transformation to reinterpret tensions between normalizing and curative approaches to disability technology and the surprising interactions between participants and researchers that alternately contest and afrm the potentialities of these projects . 3 REPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF AN INTERVENTIONIST RESEARCH ARC The increased volume of scholarship critical of HCI’s relationship to disabled people has been met with tension from mainstream epis - temic approaches to disability within HCI . Previously , the frst and second author have worked together to bridge epistemic conficts . We continue this relationship in a mutually refexive and repara - tive analysis of the second author’s past interventionist projects . We highlight disjunctures between researcher intent and impact uncovered by our reparative readings . This selection of Dr . Boyd’s HCI interventions for social skills and non - verbal communication in autistic users illustrates a personal arc of transformation in re - search practice . The following four projects were conducted in consecutive years , demonstrating the author’s journey from the normative - interventionist position toward conscious counterven - tional practices . Conducting reparative readings of this arc allows us to imagine how such research “could have happened diferently from the way it actually did” [ 50 : 25 ] . We identify the counter - narrative moments in which the researcher is confronted with tensions between the “single story” of autism in HCI and their participants’ desires to formulate counterventional principles for alternatives in interventionist HCI . 3 . 1 The sayWAT Project 3 . 1 . 1 Project Description and motivation . The sayWAT project [ 12 ] employed an AR headset to visualize the wearer’s prosody ( i . e . , tone of voice , volume ) . These AR cues were meant to inform the autistic wearer how to adjust their prosody to match normative con - versational expectations . This prosodic visualization intervention aimed to provide awareness of a fat voice pattern that is perceived by neurotypicals as negative in a “naturalistic” environment [ 52 ] . Simply stated , the system prescribes curative behavior change to align with clinically established norms . In the original paper , this negative pattern is presented as a “dire” autistic trait requiring in - tervention due to the evidence that unusual prosody may impact employability [ 51 ] , social relationships [ 63 ] , and mental health [ 14 ] : “Atypical prosodic patterns can heavily limit the opportunities for individuals with autism to establish social connections during face - to - face conversations . . . Over time , atypical prosody contributes to chronic social difculties that impact quality of life for people with autism . ” [ 12 : 4872 ] 3 . 1 . 2 Project Reflection . This project targeted the neurodivergent person’s atypical communication as the behavior to change , thus placing the onus of inclusion in social spaces onto the disabled user . The disabled user becomes burdened by the technologically enforced expectation to become aware of and eventually change autistic traits in real time . Although the system design involved stakeholder groups from clinical and educational backgrounds , autistic participants were only involved in the evaluation stage of the work . These participants expressed their concerns after their trial use of the system : “Your natural inclination is to go a little cross - eyed” in reference to looking at the tiny screen in front of his eye [ 12 : 8 ] . Another said that the “system was very difcult ; you have to be in the right position to see the whole screen” [ 12 : 8 ] . Beyond discomfort with a wearable technology , participants expressed confusion over the goal of the system . Participants did not appear to have an awareness of the targeted prosodic trait and were perplexed to learn of it and what it meant , especially when the corrective features would still be triggered by their neurotypical interlocutor . One participant said , “It would sometimes say ‘fat’ but that’s when he was talking” [ 12 : 8 ] . The lack of participant concern for correcting fat prosody was evident in quotes such as “I was wrapped up in the conversation , didn’t really want to look at it , would see fat a few times like 200 times , it was the volume thing mostly ignored it” [ 12 : 8 ] . The lack of meaningfulness of this system to the end users raises the question of the motivation for the system – an attempt to reinforce normative social rules on a population not invested in or in control of these traits . When participant feedback is only solicited at end - stage evaluation , their critiques are not given the space to redirect the project , resulting in a vestigial form of participation that amounts to footnotes in the fnal text . 3 . 1 . 3 Project Reparation . Although it is true that autistic people experience an 85 % under or unemployment rate , regardless of ed - ucational level [ 51 ] and report higher rates of psychoemotional distress [ 14 ] , it has been recently reported that neurotypical con - versational partners make thin - slice judgements to exclude autistic interlocutors within seconds in all conversational mediums other than text [ 48 ] , and that the higher rates of suicidal thoughts and be - haviors among autistic people may in part be explained by the stress of “trying to ft in” [ 13 ] . Recent research highlights how neurodi - vergent people often experience and internalize social and physical interactions diferently [ 17 , 48 , 49 ] . If implicit social and behav - ioral norms are internalized based on interpreting feedback from one’s social and physical environment [ 47 : 36 ] , then autistic people may indeed beneft from systems which make these implicit norms explicit and facilitate their agential behavior in social situations . However , the sayWAT system’s orientation of intervention was directed inward toward the autistic user . Therefore , the persistent attention to these hidden conversational norms was disorienting and unsatisfactory for the end users . While autistic participants did express that they wanted more information about the social world – they did not specifcally ask Counterventions CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany for feedback on their own behavior . For example , as one participant explains , “if you could know a person’s interest due to the tone of her voice that might be interesting . If you can pick up if the person is bored , the person you’re talking to , it would be pretty interesting like allow the person speaking to shift gears to get to something they know . . . Who are they talking to . ” [ 12 : 8 ] . A more refective system might provide insight into alternative conversational choices by visualizing prosody of those around the autistic user . To arrive at such an alternative , the researcher would have had to be actively and refexively engaged with the participants before imagining what the problem was and designing a solution . These insights will inform a counterventional principle described in Section 4 . 3 . 2 The ProCom Project 3 . 2 . 1 Project Description and Motivation . The Procom project used a wearable , necklace - like infrared sensor device to visualize in - terpersonal proximity in social space . The system identifed inter - personal proximity and indicated “optimal” ranges for prosocial nonverbal communication . ProCom is designed from the behavior interventionist’s perspective , based on the theory that difculties with intero and proprioceptive senses ( sensory awareness of inter - nal bodily sensations and awareness of the body in space ) distract autistic people from internalizing normative social cues . The au - thors assert awareness of and attention to these implicit social norms is imperative to efective social communication [ 11 : 1 ] : “Prox - imity regulation is critical for successful social interaction , as its dysregulation can lead to personal space violations ( and ensuing feelings of discomfort ) , as well as the inadvertent miscommunica - tion of social intentions . . . ” Again , the metrics of “optimal” range are determined by clinical authority rather than through meaning - ful participation of autistic users . The burden of change is placed solely on the disabled person . 3 . 2 . 2 Project Reflection . Like SayWAT , ProCom also targeted the neurodivergent person’s atypical nonverbal communication as the behavior to change , assuming that the neurotypical person’s prox - imity to the user is correct and it is the burden of the user to stay in an appropriate zone for the type of interaction they aspire to have ( i . e . , intimate , personal , social , public ) [ 11 : 2 ] . Although neurotypical children were part of the interface design , neurodivergent children were not included until the evaluation of the functional prototype . In the SayWAT project , we explore tensions between researcher intent and participant desire . In the ProCom project , these tensions are most perceptible when acknowledging the power diferential between autistic children and the normative desires their parents have for them . ProCom is built to meet parent’s desires : “I want them to know not to stand too close because it is annoying the person in front of you , and they are going to be like “back up” but it is not something they are motivated to care about” [ 11 : 8 ] . Another example of the ProCom project privileging parent expectations over autistic children’s preferences is illustrated when a parent exclaims : “I’m so proud of you because you tolerated that on your body . . . Not too long ago he wouldn’t have been able to do that” [ 11 : 9 ] . Here , the voices and desires of parents are supported over the bodily discomfort of the autistic child . 3 . 2 . 3 Project Reparation . Sasson et al . have found that frst im - pressions of autistic people improve when diagnosis is disclosed , and the social partners are given destigmatizing information about autistic people [ 49 ] . Emerging research on autistic sociality demon - strates that autistic - to - autistic conversations exhibit recognizable patterns similar in function to , but divergent in form from , neu - rotypical conversational norms [ 17 ] . A counterventional nonverbal communication technology might fip the intervention target by educating NT users about why an ND person may be engaging in unexpected / non - normative proximity , and coach more direct forms of communicating needs and preferences between both part - ners without making assumptions about interlocutor intentions or desires . To engage in this kind of counter - normative design , a re - searcher would have to be intentionally exposed to the disconnects between the clinical literature on autism and the Autistic commu - nity’s political desires for acceptance and access . This insight will be further explored in Section 4 . 3 . 3 The vrSocial Project 3 . 3 . 1 Project Description and Motivation . In the vrSocial project , features of SayWAT and ProCom are ported to the VR context and expanded to include turn taking regulation via a “time talking meter” . As with SayWAT and ProCom , the researchers assert in - terventions that target internalization of normative conversational behaviors as essential to improving autistic quality of life : “Specif - cally , this work seeks to address how we might reasonably make visible the nonverbal conversational cues that are invisible to many children with autism” [ 10 : 1 – 2 , 35 ] . The system is designed with the assumption that neurodivergent people are not only unaware of nonverbal norms , but that if they were made aware they would nat - urally conform . The purpose is to visualize normative expectations and to enforce those norms as “correct” regardless of context . 3 . 3 . 2 Project Reflection . Although this project presented both the NT and ND interlocutor with visualized feedback of proximity and turn taking , the target for behavior change is still assumed to be the autistic user . Unlike SayWAT and ProCom , the vrSocial project involved developmentally disabled adults at a work program in the ideation and prototyping phases . Autistic children were then directly involved in system evaluation . The vrSocial project involved intended end users from the start until the end of the software development lifecycle [ 10 : 3 ] , however the onus to change was still intended to fall on the ND users . This is demonstrated by quantitative measures which only report the ND users’ performance as fndings . Additionally , while the system was used in a mixed - neurotype context and encouraged collaborative interactions in conversational turn taking , the system prioritizes neuronormative sociality as the goal . The system , although collab - orative in use , is based on NT norms . 3 . 3 . 3 Project Reparation . Despite these normative motivations and goals , the actual experiences of NT - ND conversational pairs within the vrSocial system illustrated opportunities for cross - neurotype collaboration and understanding . The turn taking meter subtly dis - courages the NT partner from flling in empty space just because CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Rua Williams et al . the ND partner is taking longer to respond – thus opening oppor - tunities for the ND user to be an equal participant in conversation they might otherwise have been inadvertently sidelined in . NTs were coached to not exceed 50 % of the time talking . One ND participants who scored a perfect 50 % on his last combination session giggled , “my voice was getting really longer , ” and then exclaimed to his mom “oh my gosh , I got it all the way to his voice , ” indicating he understood , attended to , and referenced the time - talking bar to mediate his speaking duration [ 10 : 8 ] . In this project , the researcher is deliberately subverting interventional norms by explicitly altering the NT default behavior . In this way , the intervention produces a self - conscious critique of dominant social intervention approaches that seek only to modify the behavior of ND participants . Crucially , these moments of participant self - testimony are further used to contextualize the quantitative results of the study . These insights will inform counterventional principles in Section 4 . 3 . 4 The vrSensory Project 3 . 4 . 1 Project Description and Motivation . The vrSensory project takes up opposition to the prior three projects in both research aims and in target domain . No longer about informing an autistic user about their nonnormative social communication behaviors , vrSensory targets the sensory aspects of the physical environment , handing control over environmental conditions directly to the neu - rodivergent user . Although social skills and social communication are a meta - context for the technology , the diverse and divergent sensory needs of autistic people during social interactions becomes the space for design – the goal of the system is to facilitate sensory comfort and delight during play for mixed - ability groups . Targeting inclusivity , the authors expand from designing for autism and include others on the neurodiversity spectrum . They tar - get sensory processing challenges not only for people with autism , but also for those with ADHD , and with typical development . The authors state [ 62 : 1 ] : “By addressing the user’s often hidden sensory needs as system requirements , I leverage the recent fndings of neu - rologists who argue sensory processing challenges are likely the basis for diferences in social behavior and learning . ” This project represents a break from traditional interventionist thought . The intended user group is a mixed - neurotype social pair , and the target of intervention or change is the sensory environment rather than the human users . 3 . 4 . 2 Project Reflection . The vrSensory project is targeting inclu - sion through sensory accessibility rather than intervention via training normative social skills . The project involves diverse users from the earliest phases of design . The vrSensory environments addressed a range in sensory preferences by asking neurodiverse children ( 1 autistic , 1 ADHD , and 1 neurotypical ) what they might want via co - designing and paper prototyping sessions with families and children . There is no expected behavior to be performed and measured , and no burden is unduly placed on the ND user for the beneft of NT social partners . All users have agency within the system and the novel virtual play experiences are privileged in the results over metrics of ND behaviors as evidenced by the quotes about what they liked about the novel ( sensory ) experience [ 62 : 6 ] : “What I really liked about thunderstorm was you could go inside this rock , and you could see the water droplets come inside the rock and drop on the foor . ” - Cassidy ( ADHD ) ; “That’s cool ! I saw the rain this side . I saw the rain ! Lightening in the mountain right there . I saw the thing . Yes . ohohoh . Saw that I saw the rain , whole bunch thunder right now . ” - Max ( Autism ) 3 . 4 . 3 Project Reparation . In sayWAT , ProCom , and vrSocial , ten - sions between researcher aims and participant desires are apparent from the testimony of the participants themselves . Some partic - ipants even reported distress when using these systems , though these results are directly reported in the papers , they are presented as limitations of the system design but not as a critique of the re - search aims – deprioritizing participant voice in favor of neuronor - mative performance metrics ( i . e . , participant discomfort is the price of behavior change , and thus the price for inclusion and access ) . vrSensory is itself a reparation of prior work . The authors redirect the interventional target toward the environment as the barrier to inclusion , instead of personal traits and behaviors . The vrSen - sory virtual spaces let everyone play collaboratively to remove environmental barriers and share a welcoming play experience . This counter - normative intervention is made possible through the lessons learned in prior work . Where sayWAT made assumptions about what users needed based on clinical literature , vrSensory iden - tifed domains of struggle as described by Autistic self - advocates . Where proCom identifed autistic behavior as abberant and in need of restraint and redirection , vrSensory understood the environment as a constraint to social engagement . Where vrSocial made assump - tions about what users needed to know in order to relate to one another , vrSensory gave users full agency over the co - construction of their social world . 4 DISCUSSION : A COUNTERVENTIONAL FRAME FOR RESEARCH RETROSPECTIVES AND FUTURE DESIGN To develop a notion of “counterventions” , we followed the second author’s arc of interventionist HCI for disability , specifcally autism . In surveys of prior work in technological interventions for autistic people , researchers have noted that social skills and social inter - action norms dominate the research context in this area [ 53 , 67 ] . However , work that seeks to assess what the autistic community most desires from research inquiry contests this focus on social skills , highlighting the need for support in “dealing with sensory difculties , multi - tasking and anxiety” [ 41 : 761 ] . Recent studies in critical psychology also support this turn away from social inter - ventions . Sasson and colleagues have identifed social stigma from neurotypical peers as a primary factor in interpersonal difculties for autistic people [ 17 , 48 , 49 ] . Further , research into the causes of higher rates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the autistic population has found that social stigma and the stress of “trying to ft in” ( in other words , the dominance of social norms ) are at the heart of psychoemotional distress in autistic people [ 9 , 13 ] . These reports highlight a stark disconnect between prior HCI interven - tions that focus on social skills and participant community desires for support in day - to - day tasks [ 2 , 33 , 56 ] . Reparative readings of Counterventions CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany these disjunctures in the selected interventionist HCI arc allow us to imagine an alternative framework for inquiry . At its core , a “countervention” is a project that grapples with the infuence of the normative gaze in constructing “the problem” and the power of neoliberal logics to authoritatively dictate “the solution” , i . e . , “intervention” . Therefore , to intervene upon such a normalizing intervention requires the researcher to recognize , as Frantz Fanon did , that “the political and the psychic are intimately tied” [ 44 : 304 ] . In her detailed interpretation of Fanon’s critical psy - chiatric approach , Robcis illustrates that a critical ethic of interven - tion must be a “site of producing ‘dis - alienating’ forces” [ 44 : 318 ] . Such an ethic reinterprets “the subject” as a cultural informant , from which “the problem” can be recontextualized as a byproduct of oppressive structures rather than an inherent faw of disabled embodiment . Thus , a “countervention” is a project that intentionally shifts focus from the disabled body - as - a - problem [ 60 ] to the societal structures that construct the disabled body - as - a - problem in the frst place . Such a shift necessitates that inquiry be directed by in - siders of the “problem body” group , either via direct participation or by deep engagement of the researcher with the culturally particular perspectives of the participant group [ 65 ] . From such engagement , it becomes possible to interrogate an intervention’s function as either “curative” ( in the normalizing sense ) or assistive [ 57 ] , the former enforcing normalization and the latter afording agential engagement . Such an interrogation opens discussion within the research community about the authentic aims of inquiry , as well as the assumptions , misconceptions , and biases that shape inquiry toward oppressive mechanisms . From these discussions , we hope for community - wide refection on practices that have harmed par - ticipant groups that might engender a commitment to change [ 64 ] . Below we present fve principles for analyzing and building a coun - terventional mode of inquiry , though such a project cannot be bound by linear modalities , and should develop organically and recursively : 1 . Refexively engage with the participant community : This principle is distinct from any participatory methods the project might otherwise engage in . While participatory methods allow participants to shape the research narrative in essential ways , it is possible to conduct participatory re - search with marginalized subjects that does not question dominant societal assumptions about that participant group . In Particular , research with disabled participants commonly centers the authority of clinicians and fails to acknowledge clinical bias and presumptions . Refexive engagement re - quires a commitment to humility , surprise , and discomfort [ 42 , 45 ] . 2 . Critically examine the disconnects between interven - tion and participants’ desires : This principle requires a conscious assessment of what participants imagine for them - selves outside of the context of clinical care . Clinical perspec - tives dominate the frame of intervention , from the defnition of the problem to the establishment of optimal outcomes . This framing is rarely informed by the day - to - day experi - ences of disabled people and their desires and aspirations . [ 66 ] 3 . Interrogate the political entanglements that construct the intervention domain : When HCI researchers are un - informed about the histories of other felds’ research in the intervention domain , they are unaware of how their work may rely upon and exacerbate harms caused by those legacies [ 7 , 36 ] . Furthermore , when HCI researchers remain ignorant to the social and material realities of their participant demo - graphic , they may produce solutions that are impossible to deploy . For example , much HCI research fails to acknowledge how disabled people are subjected to policies of enforced poverty and precarity to access life - saving care [ 69 ] . 4 . Develop an intervention as a self - critique of these dis - connects and entanglements : The countervention should actively draw out the disconnects between participant de - sires and prior work , making visible the historical and social context that prior work has left hidden . Counterventional outcomes should , through the presentation and analysis of data , make empirical commentary on the ecological validity of conventional approaches [ 4 ] . 5 . Privilege participant experiential testimony in the evaluation of outcomes : When performance on quantita - tive assessment is used as the primary tool for evaluating “efectiveness” of intervention , it becomes possible to make claims about the success of a project that may have caused psycho - emotional , or even physical , harm to the participants that they were not enabled to express . Participant experi - ences should be the primary source of outcome evaluation without being fltered through proxy report . [ 65 , 73 ] These principles are derived by engaging critical inquiry in dis - ability studies , science and technology studies , and feminist philos - ophy . Principle 1 is a mandate for refection and humility , building from a tradition of refexivity in design established by prior schol - ars [ 42 , 45 ] . Principle 2 is informed by prior research revealing a bias in interventionist inquiry that privileges the perspectives of social agents that hold power over disabled people rather than disabled people themselves [ 30 , 41 , 53 , 65 – 67 ] . Principle 3 requires researchers to ground their inquiry in a deeper historical context that informs present power disparities , naturalizes the dismissal of disabled testimony , and renders it always suspect and unreliable [ 57 , 64 ] . Principle 4 is meant to focus the work of transformation inward , on the researchers themselves , rather than re - enact tech - nosaviorist impulses common in interventionist HCI [ 21 ] . Principle 5 is essential to manifesting transformation in future research . Interventionist researchers tend to prefer positivist analy - sis of quantifable outcomes as the standard of scientifc rigor . In her critique of normative presumptions guiding discourse of academic and scientifc rigor , Donna Riley asserts “a focus on efectiveness precludes judgments about appropriateness ; ‘what works’ closes of moral questions about what should be” [ 43 : 10 ] . Therefore , Principle 5 engages researchers in Riley’s call for vigor in research – the impacts of research on the embodied experiences of disabled people should supersede any quantitative assessment based on measures determined by those with social power over them . Refexive engagement with the participant community dialec - tically informs analysis of Community - research disconnects and understanding of historical and social context . Together , these three CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Rua Williams et al . Table 1 : Rubric for Counterventional Criteria 1 . ARTICULATE the researcher’s journey of refexive engagement with the participant community 0 = No acknowledgement of targeted user in the lifecycle 1 = Brief or vague mention of including the participant community 2 = Some discussion of how participants are included in research aims and design 3 = Discuss the political / historical tensions between literature and participant experiences and describe how they hope to address it with the project Table 2 : Rubric for Counterventional Criteria 2 . ( Re ) ORIENT the project to critically examine the disconnects between intervention and participants’ desires 0 = No acknowledgement of the end users’ wants and needs from novel technologies 1 = Project acknowledges proxy users were included in design , but not end users 2 = Project is collaborative , designed with marginalized expertise 3 = Project is devoted to participants’ desires without ulterior motive characteristics guide the design of an Intervention - as - critique . The study design informs what testimony it is possible to collect , while refexive engagement , disconnect analysis , and historical context shapes how researchers contextualize this testimony as an expres - sion of counterventional knowledge . There are many ways to put these principles into practice . Each situation will determine the appropriate methods of inquiry , data collection , interpretation , and outcome evaluation . Through reparative readings of the projects presented in the previous section , we arrived at insights about what might drive or enact counterventional research design . Those insights then in - formed the 5 principles above . We now return to the four projects and assess their manifestation of the principles to illustrate a trans - formative arc in the nature of the author’s research . As principles , the counterventional framework can seem confned to retrospec - tive analysis . It can be difcult to understand how to operationalize principles in any satisfactory sense . We integrate the spirit of these principles with common refections noted in the retrospective repar - ative analysis to rephrase these principals into actionable criteria with a rubric to measure the extent to which these criteria have been met . The primary author of these interventions does not begin to engage with Principle 1 until the fourth project , vrSensory , when the target of intervention is fnally redirected outside the disabled user . To turn this principle into action , the researcher must artic - ulate their process of refexive engagement with the participant community ( refer to rubric in Table 1 ) . Likewise , the frst two projects do not meet Principal 2 , as they focus on the behavior change of the autistic user and leave no room for user agency in selecting and acting upon information . vrSocial and vrSensory begin to improve on this , vrSocial by equalizing the expectations of the social playing feld and vrSensory by focusing on physical barriers to access and inclusion . To put this principle into practice , the researcher must ( re ) orient the intervention away from the marginalized body and toward systems of oppression ( refer to rubric in Table 2 ) . SayWAT and ProCom do not meet Principle 3 as they begin from and end with an unquestioned normative social expectation for which the autistic participant is responsible for meeting . vrSocial begins to interrogate the construction of neurotypical social norms almost by accident , when neurotypical participants fnd themselves resisting the temptation to fll “empty” conversational space when attending to the turn taking monitor . vrSensory makes this interro - gation more explicit , by making all users responsible for the social and sensory comfort of social partners that are disabled by a hostile sensory environment . To operationalize this interrogation of politi - cal entanglements , the researcher must identify who is burdened by system expectations and refect on how that burden sustains existing oppressive norms ( refer to rubric in Table 3 ) . Although Principle 4 might require an explicit awareness of the counterventional aim , vrSocial and vrSensory achieve an im - plicit critique through the destabilization of normative social ex - pectations . A fully realized countervention would explain how the project performs a critique on prior work and norms in the feld ( refer to rubric in Table 4 ) . Finally , for Principle 5 , only vrSocial and vrSensory begin to take up this practice , as participant experiences are fnally allowed to contraindicate or replace quantitative metrics of performance based on neuronormative ideals . To make the privileging of partici - pant testimony an intentional research practice , counterventions are explicitly designed to center participant experience both phe - nomenologically and in data collection methods . Simply , the project must directly produce afordances for participants to speak back and produce counter - narrative testimony ( refer to rubric in Table 5 ) . In Table 6 we provide a breakdown of how the projects analyzed in Section 4 match up to the rubrics discussed above . Through this table , we hope to illustrate how the counterventional criteria can be a personal refection tool for HCI researchers to evaluate their own trajectory toward personal ideals of design justice . Counterventions CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Table 3 : Rubric for Counterventional Criteria 3 . IDENTIFY WHO IS BURDENED by project expectations to interrogate the political entanglementsthat construct the intervention domain 0 = No acknowledgement of user burden 1 = Acknowledgement of burden to change on marginalized community , burden not addressed 2 = Project integrates participant voice and engages with community scholars , activists , and thought leaders 3 = direct participation of the most impacted ; sovereignty over interpretation and dissemination Table 4 : Rubric for Counterventional Criteria 4 .

This approach simultaneously reveals and resolves faws in the imple - mentation and interpretation of intervention design and outcomes , compelling other researchers to refect on how their own research and development practices may construct misconceptions about the lived reality of disabled subjects . The counterventional approach to research inquiry is a struc - tured means to engage with biases in researcher perception and the cultural norms with which labs interact with participants . lab cul - ture express purpose of a countervention is to manifest epistemic transformation within the research team and their professional communities as a result of critical refection and engagement with the broader historical , cultural , and social legacies of the particular design space . The research products that result from a counter - ventional practice may not necessarily announce themselves as counterventions in dissemination artifacts such as posters , presen - tations , and manuscripts . Evaluation of counterventional outcomes is best conducted through a case study of the research project itself rather than on analysis of data produced by participant interaction with any resultant HCI artifacts . In this paper , we retrospectively analyze an interventionist HCI researcher’s project arc , producing reparative readings of those cases to inform counterventional principals . We began with an assessment of HCI - based interventions for autistic people , con - textualizing dominant HCI inquiry against insights from Critical Disability Studies . From this assessment , we note that HCI projects for autism are dominated by interventions that target social skills . At the same time , emerging research has supported autistic peo - ple’s own interests in task management and daily - living strategies as a primary domain of difculty . Our reparative readings expose CHI ’23 , April 23 – 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Rua Williams et al . conficts and tensions that emerge between participant desires and researcher aims , rupturing dominant modes of inquiry and provid - ing space for new counterventional imaginaries . We propose “counterventions” as a critical approach to research design that engages with community - informed counterargument in the design of systems that elicit alternative imaginaries to norma - tive intervention . This approach reinterprets disabled ( or otherwise marginalized ) participants as cultural informants , from which “the problem” can be recontextualized as a byproduct of oppressive structures rather than an inherent faw of divergent embodiment . It should be possible for researchers to extend this concept to other spaces fraught with power disparities , such as equity in education , sustainable development , and public health . Counterventional ap - proaches may reveal new directions for research inquiry in many HCI domains , such as in designs of accessible technology , investi - gations into AI equity , explorations of gendered issues in HCI for health , culturally responsive design of educational technologies , and many others . We hope that this project serves as an example of critical practice in designing and evaluating interventional technologies . May such practices result in a communal shift from curative “correction” or normalization toward collective respect and mutual care . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was partially funded by Dr . Rua M .
