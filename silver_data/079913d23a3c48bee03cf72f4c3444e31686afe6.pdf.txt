These peripheral proteins displayed a tight association with mitochondria and coimmunoprecipitated from mitochondrial fractions . In line with a role for LIN7 in the regulation of IRSp53 activity on actin dynamics , the morphology of mitochondria was similarly altered by changing the expression levels of either each protein or both , whereas mito - chondrial morphology was preserved in cells overexpressing IRSp53 deleted of its binding domains for LIN7 ( IRSp53 (cid:2) 5 ) or for actin polymerisation modulators ( IRSp53 (cid:2) SH3 ) . In particular , the overexpres - sion of full length LIN7 and / or IRSp53 increased the percentage of cells with short mitochondria , while downregulation of the endogenous proteins by shRNAs increased the amount of cells with elongated and perinuclear clustered mitochondria . These mitochondria were only partially resistant to fragmenta - tion induced by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential ( i . e . treatment with sodium azide ) , whereas mitochondria were fully protected by the ﬁssion defective mutant Drp1 K38A . Overexpres - sion of LIN7 or IRSp53 did not prevent the formation of hyperfused mitochondria in cells coexpressing the Drp1 K38A mutant , thus suggesting that LIN7 - IRSp53 complex requires functional Drp1 to regulate mitochondrial morphology . © 2016 Elsevier GmbH .

Introduction Mitochondrial fusion - ﬁssion dynamic is regulated by GTPases : Mitofusin 1 , 2 on the outer mitochondrial membrane , OMM ( Karbowski et al . , 2002 ; Santel and Fuller , 2001 ; ) , and Optic Atro - phy 1 in the inner mitochondrial membrane ( Alexander et al . , 2000 ) mediate mitochondrial fusion , while mitochondrial ﬁssion is driven by OMM recruitment of the dynamin related protein 1 , Drp 1 ( Bleazard et al . , 1999 ) . Growing evidence in literature indi - cates an active role for actin in Drp1 - mediated ﬁssion ( De Vos et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2015 ; Ji et al . , 2015 ) . Mitochondrial ﬁssion is preceded by a mitochondrial pre - constriction step occurring at mitochondria ( MITO ) - endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) contact sites ( Friedman et al . , 2011 ) , where the Inverted formin - 2 ( INF2 ) on the ER ( Korobova Abbreviations : Drp1 , dynamin - related GTPase ; IRSp53 , insulin receptor sub - strate protein 53 kDa ; ER , endoplasmic reticulum ; MITO , mitochondria ; OMM , outer mitochondrial membrane ; PM , plasma membrane . ∗ Corresponding author at : Via Vanvitelli 32 , Milano , 20129 , Italy .

The IRSp53 insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa couples membrane remodelling with polymerisation of the actin cytoskele - ton ( Scita et al . , 2008 ) , as its IMD / I - BAR domain may induce either plasma membrane ( PM ) protrusions or geometrically correspond - ing invaginations toward the interior of vesicles ( Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ) , while its SH3 domain interacts with proline - rich domains of actin ﬁlament nucleators , including actin ﬁlament nucleation - promoting factors , WAVEs , and mammalian Diaphanous - related formins , mDias ( Goh et al . , 2012 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ; Scita et al . , 2008 ) . In the epithelial Madin - Darby - canine - kidney ( MDCK ) and in neuron - like cell lines , IRSp53 associates through its COOH - terminal PDZ target sequence with the PDZ1 domain of the small scaffold protein LIN7 ( Hori et al . , 2003 ) , a positive regulator of IRSp53 localisation and activity at speciﬁc PM domains in neurons and epithelial cells ( Crespi et al . , 2012 ; Ferrari et al . , 2012 ; Massari et al . , 2009 ) .

We have therefore investigated the localisation of endogenous LIN7 and IRSp53 , as well as the effects of modiﬁcations in their expression level on mitochondrial morphol - ogy in HeLa cells . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . Localisation of LIN7 and IRSp53 on mitochondria Confocal microscopy analysis of HeLa cells stained with Texas Red - conjugated Mitotracker and anti - LIN7 or anti - IRSp53 antibod - ies ( Fig . 1A - B ) revealed a ﬁne punctate staining of both proteins , which often appeared regularly spaced within 1 (cid:3) m distance along Mitotracker - positive structures ( Fig . 1B ) . The antibodies also revealed a weaker punctate staining , widespread in the cytoplasm and not reminiscent of plasma membrane or major intracellular organelles , such as ER or Golgi . However , LIN7 and IRSp53 were not cytosolic , as no signal was virtually recovered in the supernatant fraction , ( S ) , enriched in superoxide dismutase 1 , SOD1 ( Fig . 1C ) . Approximately a 60 % of the LIN7 and IRSp53 signals cofractionated in crude mitochondrial fractions ( MITO ) enriched for the OMM marker TOM20 , and the remaining signals in the membrane - containing pellet ( P ) upon cen - trifugation of the post mitochondrial supernatant ( PMS ) . LIN7 and IRSp53 were extracted from the MITO fraction with alkaline solu - tion ( 0 . 2 M Na 2 CO 3 ) , but were resistant to high salt buffer ( 0 . 5 M NaCl ) , indicating that they are peripheral proteins tightly associ - ated to mitochondria ( Fig . 1D ) . Association of LIN7 with IRSp53 on mitochondria was suggested by their co - immunoprecipitation from solubilised MITO ( Fig . 1E ) . As reliable speciﬁc markers for the PM in HeLa cells are lack - ing , to exclude PM contamination of the MITO fractions , cells were biotinylated with impermeant Sulpho NHS - LC - biotin before lysis , and biotinylated surface proteins were used to deplete PM from the post nuclear supernatant ( PNS ) by using a streptavidin magnetic beads isolation protocol ( Zhao et al . , 2004 ) . The streptavidin beads efﬁciently retained > 85 % of biotinylated proteins ( Fig . 1F , compare PNS before and after PM depletion ) . Nevertheless , the PM - depleted MITO fraction still contained ∼ 40 % of the total amount of LIN7 and IRSp53 found in MITO + PMS fractions . The mitochondrial localisation of LIN7 and IRSp53 is not a pecu - liarity of HeLa cells , as it was regularly observed in non - polarized epithelial MDCK cells and undifferentiated neuronal Neuro - 2A cells ( Fig . S1 in supplementary material ) . 2 . 2 . Mitochondrial shortening in HeLa cells overexpressing LIN7 and / or IRSp53 As expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial net - work remodelling causes changes in mitochondrial morphology ( Osteryoung and Nunnari , 2003 ) , we analysed the effect of the overexpression of GFP - tagged IRSp53 and LIN7 , expressed either individually or in combination . Localisation in puncta along mito - chondria was occasionally detected in GFP - IRSp53 expressing cells ( Fig . 2A ) , and never in GFP - LIN7A cells , probably due to the high background , although both GFP - tagged proteins were largely found in MITO fractions ( data not shown ) . Transfected cells were subdivided according to their mitochon - drial network morphology as depicted in Fig . 2B ( Losón et al . , 2013 ; Smirnova et al . , 2001 ) . The mitochondrial network appeared fragmented in GFP - LIN7 and / or GFP - IRSp53 overexpressing cells , with a reduction in control ( CTR ) and clustered mitochondria in favor of a ∼ three - fold increase in mitochondria with fragmented or mixed morphology compared to GFP - transfected cells , regardless of whether LIN7 and IRSp53 were expressed individually or co - expressed ( Fig . 2C ) . Interestingly , the mitochondrial morphology was not affected in cells expressing IRSp53 deleted of its binding domain for LIN7 ( IRSp53 (cid:2) 5 ) and F - actin nucleators ( IRSp53 (cid:2) SH3 ) , thus supporting the relevance of these domains in IRSp53 functions . Measurements of mitochondrial length conﬁrmed the altered mor - phology observed in cells overexpressing LIN7 and IRSp53 ( Fig . 2D ) . A two - fold highly signiﬁcant decrease in both mitochondrial length and longest mitochondrion was measured in regions of interest , ROIs , at the cell periphery . 2 . 3 . Mitochondrial elongation in cells downregulated for LIN7 and / or IRSp53 We then tested the mitochondrial morphology in cells down - regulated for LIN7C and / or IRSp53 . Speciﬁcity of the shRNAs is demonstrated by the clear signal reduction of both proteins in MITO fractions analysed by Western blot ( Fig . 3A ) . Few cells exhibited a mixed morphology , while virtually none had fragmented mitochondria in control ( GFP ) and downregulated cells . Conversely , downregulation of either LIN7C and / or IRSp53 increased the percentage of cells with elongated mitochondria ( Fig . 3B ) , often clustered in the perinuclear region , as shown by the two - fold increase in Mitotracker signal ratio between the perinu - clear area and the cell periphery ( Fig . 3C ) . Moreover , we measured a signiﬁcant increase in mitochondrial length in cells expressing individual or combined shRNAs ( Fig . 3D ) . The coexpression of the shRNA resistant LIN7A rescued the effects of shRNA LIN7C but not that of shRNA IRSp53 , as well as the expression of IRSp53 did not rescue the elongated phenotype of mitochondria in shRNA LIN7C ( Fig . S2 in supplementary material ) , further indicating the speci - ﬁcity of the shRNAs and the interdependent functions of these proteins . 2 . 4 . LIN7 and IRSp53 require functional Drp1 to regulate mitochondrial morphology The relationship between levels of LIN7 and IRSp35 and mito - chondrial length suggested a possible involvement of the complex in Drp1ﬁssion pathway . To this purpose , we ﬁrst compared the resistance to stimuli inducing mitochondrial fragmentation of LIN7 and / or IRSp53 downregulated cells with that of cells expressing the ﬁssion defective mutant Drp1 K38A ( Fig . 4A ) . After 120 min treatment with 30 mM NaN 3 to induce dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential ( Losón et al . , 2013 ) , 100 % of control GFP - transfected cells exhibited fragmented or mixed mitochondrial morphology , whereas ∼ 30 % and 40 % of cells respectively downreg - ulated for IRSp53 and / or LIN7 or expressing the dominant - negative Drp1 K38A mutant were still protected from ﬁssion . However , mitochondria in downregulated cells were less protected than in Drp1 K38A cells , as only clustered mitochondria from Drp1 K38A expressing cells were completely spared from fragmentation for the entire duration of the experiments ( right panel ) . Thus , down - regulation of LIN7 or IRSp53 causes ﬁssion attenuation rather than its abrogation . To verify the possibility that LIN7 and IRSp53 require a permis - sive mitochondrial ﬁssion machinery to perform their functions , we inhibited the Drp1 ﬁssion pathway ( Fig . 4B ) .

Scale bar , 1 (cid:3) m . were consistently detected either in cells expressing the Drp1 K38A mutant or downregulated for LIN7 and / or IRSp53 ( Fig . 4C ) . Moreover , aberrant nuclei were rarely , if ever , observed in cells overexpressing GFP - LIN7 and / or GFP - IRSp53 . In the attempt to further investigate the role of LIN7 and IRSp53 in Drp1 - mediated ﬁssion , we next performed colocalisation exper - iments with Drp1 antibodies . The enrichment of LIN7 and IRSp53 was often very close to Drp1 ( see mask in Fig . 4D ) , and virtually all Drp1 puncta that were clearly localised at mitochondria were in proximity of LIN7 / IRSp53 enrichments , despite their overlapping being only partial even with larger Drp1 puncta ( Fig . 4D ) . A mean of 11 , 5 % ± 1 , 7 and 15 % ± 2 , 69 % of total Drp1 signal was found to colocalise with IRSp53 and LIN7 , respectively . The low percentage is not against a role of the complex in ﬁssion , because only a low percentage of Drp1 puncta ( 2 . 5 % of total puncta and 6 . 3 % of high threshold puncta ) have been documented to be ﬁssion competent , and even more interestingly actin has been documented to be one of the signal that may target Drp1 to ﬁssion competent sites ( Ji et al . , 2015 ) . Although the distribution of LIN7 and IRSp53 is suggestive of a role for the complex in localisation of Drp1 in ﬁssion compe - tent sites , further studies are required to demonstrate their role and mechanism of action in mitochondrial division . 3 . Discussion Collectively our data reveal a previously unreported localisation for LIN7 and IRSp53 on mitochondria , and a role for the LIN7 - IRSp53 complex in morphological remodelling of these organelles . Our pre - vious data indicated a role for LIN7 in the regulation of IRSp53 localisation and functions at speciﬁc surface domains in polarized epithelial and in neuronal cell lines ( Crespi et al . , 2012 ; Ferrari et al . , 2012 ; Massari et al . , 2009 ) . In these cells , the association of LIN7 with IRSp53 is required for acquisition of actin - dependent cell surface deformation , such as those involved in apico - basal polarity and neurite differentiation , and here we show that IRSp53 requires LIN7 also to regulate mitochondrial morphology . Colo - calisation of LIN7 and IRSp53 on mitochondria is suggested by their similar enrichment in puncta spaced by 1 (cid:3) m and by their co - immunoprecipitation from MITO fractions . Moreover , LIN7 rel - evance for IRSp53 function is revealed by the unaltered morphology of mitochondria in cells overexpressing IRSp53 lacking the binding domain for LIN7 ( IRSp53 (cid:2) 5 ) or downregulated for LIN7 . We found a reduced length of mitochondria in cells overex - pressing LIN7 and / or IRSp53 and elongation of the mitochondrial network in cells downregulated for these proteins . These results are consistent with either a positive role for the LIN7 - IRSp53 complex in ﬁssion or an inhibitory effect in mitochondrial fusion .

Ferrari et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology xxx ( 2016 ) xxx – xxx 7 cases , these effects should rely on IRSp53 functions , and particu - larly on its I - BAR and SH3 domains . Consistent with their speciﬁc convex geometry , the I - BAR membrane binding interface gener - ate membrane invagination when bound to the outer leaﬂet of artiﬁcial liposomes ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2006 , 2010 ) , making this domain theoretically suitable for formation of the mitochondrial constriction that precede Drp1 - mediated ﬁssion of mitochondria ( Korobova et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) . Additionally , both the I - BAR domain and Rho GTPases activators of IRSp53 bind the phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - biphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ) , mostly found in the cytosolic leaﬂet of the plasma membrane , but also active in the OMM ( Rosivatz and Woscholski , 2011 ) . Once activated by Rho GTPAses , the SH3 domain of IRSp53 can recruit actin - nucleation - promoting factors such as formins or the WAVE1 - Arp2 / 3 complex ( Goh et al . , 2012 ; Lim et al . , 2008 ; Miki et al . , 2000 ; Scita et al . , 2008 ) to form linear or branched ﬁlaments , respectively . Mitochondrial localisation of the WAVE1 - Arp2 / 3 complex has been reported in neuronal and non - neuronal cells ( Danial et al . , 2003 ; Sung et al . , 2007 ) , and in yeast ( Boldogh et al . , 2001 ) , and in line with a possible role of IRSp53 mediated by its SH3 domain , the mitochondrial morphology was unchanged in cells expressing IRSp53 lacking this domain ( IRSp53 (cid:2) SH3 ) . Growing evidence indicates that mitochondrial ﬁssion occurs at ER - MITO contact sites ( Friedman et al . , 2011 ) , where interac - tions of the actin nucleators INF2 and Spire 1C may drive nucleation and polymerisation of linear actin ﬁlaments ( Korobova et al . , 2013 , 2014 ; Manor et al . , 2015 ) . However , HeLa cells express very low , if any , of the ER - associated INF - CAAX variant ( Ramabhadran et al . , 2011 ) , and we did not observe INF2 colocalisation with mitochon - dria , LIN7 , IRSp53 or Drp1 in these cells ( unpublished results ) . Actin - dependent pathways alternative to INF2 - Spire 1C have been already suggested ( Ji et al . , 2015 ; Li et al . , 2015 ) , and IRSp53 may be alternative or may collaborate to INF2 - Spire 1C pathway depending on the cell types . Future experiments are required to identify the partners of the SH3 domains of IRSp53 in mitochondria and the mechanisms responsible for the here described effects of LIN7 - IRSp53 on mito - chondria , but collectively our work reveals a novel role for the LIN7 - IRSp53 complex in regulation of mitochondrial morphology . 4 . Materials and methods 4 . 1 . Constructs GFP - IRSp53 ( full length , (cid:2) 5 and (cid:2) SH3 ) , GFP - LIN7A and shRNA IRSp53 have been elsewhere described and validated ( Crespi et al . , 2012 ; Disanza et al . , 2006 ; Yang et al . , 2009 ) , The shRNA LIN7C sequence ( 5 (cid:5) - GGCTACTGTTGCTGCATTT - 3 (cid:5) ) was checked to exclude any signiﬁcant homology to other HeLa cell transcripts ; oligos were inserted into pSUPER . gfp / neo RNAi system ( OligoEngine , Inc . , Seat - tle , WA ) , as previously described ( Crespi et al . , 2012 ) . The cDNA encoding HA - Drp1 K38A ( Smirnova et al . , 2001 ) was a kind gift of Alexander van der Bliek ( UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine , Los Angeles , CA ) . 4 . 2 . Cell culture and transfection HeLa cells grown in DMEM + 10 % foetal bovine serum ( Euroclone , Milan , Italy ) were transiently transfected using Polyethylenimine ( PolyScience , Eppelheim , Germany ) . For co - transfections , cells were cotransfected with equal amounts of DNAs twice on con - secutive days , and ﬁxed 48 h ( Fig . 2 ) or 72 h ( Fig . 3 ) after ﬁrst transfection . shRNA LIN7C and control pSUPER . gfp were trans - fected once and ﬁxed after 48 h ( Fig . 3B ) . 4 . 3 . Subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting Cells were homogenised in buffer H ( 1 mM TrisHCl pH 7 . 4 , 15 mM KCl , 30 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , PMSF and a cocktail of pro - tease inhibitors ) using a tight - ﬁtting Teﬂon pestle attached to a Stuart SS30 stirrer ( Bibby Scientiﬁc , Stone , Staffordshire , UK ) set to 600 – 1 , 000 rpm , followed by a series of centrifugations : 600 g for 15 (cid:5) to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells ; 16 , 000 g for 30 min to obtain the MITO fraction from the PNS ; 130 , 000 g for 1 h to pellet smaller organelles from the post - mitochondrial supernatant ( PMS ) . The supernatant ( S ) was precipitated in 4 vols of ice cold acetone at − 20 ◦ C for at least 1 h followed by centrifugation at 16 , 000 g for 20 min . Pellets were resuspended in the same volume of homogeni - sation buffer and mixed with 2X SDS solubilisation buffer ( 300 mM TrisHCl pH 8 . 9 , 5 % SDS , 20 % glycerol , 1 . 4 M 2 - Mercaptoethanol ) , loaded onto 11 % SDS - PAGE , transferred onto nitrocellulose mem - branes ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences AB , Uppsala , Sweden ) and immunoprobed using speciﬁc primary antibodies , followed by infrared - conjugated anti - rabbit IgG IRDye 800CW or anti - mouse IgG 680RD ( LI - COR Bioscience , Lincoln , NE ) as secondary reagents . Blots were scanned with the Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System ( LI - COR Biosciences ) , and band intensities were determined with Image Studio software ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . 4 . 4 . Plasma membrane depletion experiments Three x100 mm petri dishes were incubated twice with 0 . 5 mg / ml EZ - Link Sulfo - NHS - LC - Biotin ( Thermo Scientiﬁc Pierce , Rockford , IL ) for 20 min at 4 ◦ C , biotin was quenched with 50 mM Glycine pH 8 for 10 min , and scraped cells were homogenised and centrifuged to obtain 1 ml of PNS that was incubated with 400 (cid:3) l of magnetic streptavidin beads ( Streptavidin Mag Sepharose , GE Healthcare ) at 4 ◦ C for 2 h ; once magnetic beads were collected ( PM ) , MITO and PMS from the depleted PNS were obtained as above . PNS and depleted PNS were probed with peroxidase - conjugated streptavidin ( Fig . 1D ) and visualised by ECL ( GE Healthcare ) . Signal intensity was quantiﬁed by densitometry using NIH ImageJ soft - ware . 4 . 5 . Immunoprecipitation The solubilised MITO fraction was afﬁnity - puriﬁed with protein - A – Sepharose ( Sigma Aldrich , Milano , Italy ) cross - linked to anti - LIN7 antibodies or pre - immune IgGs as previously described ( Crespi et al . , 2012 ) . 4 . 6 . Immunoﬂuorescence Mitochondria were stained with 500 nM Texas Red conjugated Mitotracker CMX Ros ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) dissolved in culture medium for 30 min before 4 % paraformalde - hyde ﬁxation and staining with primary and secondary antibodies ( 488 / CY5 / Rhodamine conjugated anti - rabbit / mouse antibodies , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Texas - red Phalloidin was used to stain F - actin ( Molecular Probes ) . Confocal images were acquired with Axiovert 200 M ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) equipped with spinning - disc ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) . 4 . 7 .

Ferrari et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology xxx ( 2016 ) xxx – xxx rabbit anti - IRSp53 ( Choi et al . , 2005 ) was a kind gift of Dr Eunjoon Kim ( Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ) . 4 . 8 . Image and statistical analysis Quantiﬁcation of the distance between IRSp53 / LIN7 puncta on mitochondria was carried out by measuring the mean distance among signal peaks generated with ImageJ plot proﬁle . The per - centage of colocalisation between IRSp53 / LIN7 and Mitotracker or Drp1 was obtained by calculating the Manders’ colocalisation coef - ﬁcient using ImageJ plugin JACoP ( Bolte and Cordelières , 2006 ) . Analysis of mitochondrial morphology was double - checked by a blind examiner . To quantify mitochondrial length , ROIs were selected in the cells periphery , modiﬁed with ImageJ to discriminate mitochondria and generate masks , which were compared with the originals to avoid artefacts . Mitochondrial length was measured with ImageJ plugin Analyze Skeleton ( Arganda - Carreras et al . , 2010 ) . To evaluate mitochondria clusterisation , the greyscale Mito - tracker signal for each cell analysed , was ‘inverted’ and the cell boundary drawn by outlining the signal with the Adobe Photoshop ‘brush tool’ . A rectangle ROI long as the cell’s longest axis and 40 pixels tall was drawn over the image , crossing the nucleus , and used to generate and quantify a densitometry plot . All quantitative data are presented as mean ± s . e . m . Each quartile value used to draw the box and whiskers plots represents itself the mean of at least three independent experiments . Multiple comparisons among groups were carried out by Student’s t - test using Prism software ( GraphPad PrismTM software ) , * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 01 and * * * P < 0 . 001 .
