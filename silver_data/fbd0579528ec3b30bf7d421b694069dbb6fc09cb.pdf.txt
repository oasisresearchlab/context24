Ecker 2 , 3 & Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte 1 Pluripotency , the ability to generate any cell type of the body , is an evanescent attribute of embryonic cells . Transitory pluripotent cells can be captured at different time points during embryogenesis and maintained as embryonic stem cells or epiblast stem cells in culture . Since ontogenesis is a dynamic process in both space and time , it seems counterintuitive that these two temporal states represent the full spectrum of organismal pluripotency . Here we show that by modulating culture parameters , a stem - cell type with unique spatial characteristics and distinct molecular and functional features , designated as region - selective pluripotent stem cells ( rsPSCs ) , can be efficiently obtained from mouse embryos and primate pluripotent stem cells , including humans . The ease of culturing and editing the genome of human rsPSCs offers advantages for regenerative medicine applications . The unique ability of human rsPSCs to generate post - implantation interspecies chimaeric embryos may facilitate our understanding of early human development and evolution . Two types of pluripotent stem cells ( PSCs ) have been captured from early mouse embryos . Embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) derived from the inner cell mass ( ICM ) of a pre - implantation blastocyst 1 , 2 resemble naive epiblast 3 , and epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) established from post - implantation epiblast are probably the in vitro counterparts of anterior primitive - streak cells 4 – 6 . While both are pluripotent , they bear striking differences in molecular signature , signalling depend - ency , colony morphology , cloning efficiency , metabolic requirements and epigenetic features 7 , 8 , which together with their ability to re - enter embryogenesis at different developmental time points ( pre - implanta - tion versus post - implantation , respectively ) distinguish ESCs and EpiSCs as existing in two temporally distinct pluripotent states . After embryo implantation , signals from regionalized extra - embryonic tissues guide pluripotent epiblast cells through dynamic changes to initiate the embryonic body plan that accommodates the diversified developmental fates that ensue upon gastrulation 9 . Heterotopic grafting experiments indicate that epiblast cells , regardless oftheirregionalorigins , canadoptthedevelopmentalfatecharacteristic of the cell population at the site of transplantation , illustrating their highly plastic nature 10 . Nonetheless , it is conceivable that epiblasts are subjected to regional influences and bear a multitude of pluripotent states with distinguishable molecular and functional signatures 11 . To date it remained unknown whether PSCs with distinct spatial identities could be stabilized in culture . By carefully examining the cellular res - ponse oftheepiblast todifferent exvivo environmentalstimuli , wehave isolated , with high efficiency , a stable primed pluripotent cell type from both pre - and post - implantation epiblasts that differs from EpiSCs in cloning efficiency , cell growth kinetics , transcriptomic , epigenomic and metabolic profiles . Notably , the newly identified PSCs selectively colonize the posterior region of post - implantation embryos and allow for efficient generation of ex vivo intra - and interspecies chimaeric embryos . Our study not only uncovers a novel spatially defined plur - ipotent cell type , but also opens up a new avenue for comparing early developmental programs across species . Optimizing epiblast culture parameters FGF2 / Activin - A ( F / A ) signalling supports the derivation of EpiSCs 4 , 5 , 12 . While deriving EpiSCs using a F / A - based medium 13 , we observed cellular differentiation started around day 3 and by day 4 only a few undifferentiated epiblast cells remained ( Fig . 1a , b and Extended Data Fig . 1a , b ) . This suggested to us that the pluripotent states of most of the cells present across the in vivo epiblast could not be maintained by F / A signalling . The canonical Wnt signalling path - way also has an important role in EpiSC self - renewal 14 – 17 . We tested the effect of a Wnt inhibitor IWR1 on epiblast explants . Isolated E5 . 75 epiblasts were cultured in a serum - free N2B27 medium 18 on mitoti - cally inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) supplemented with IWR1 ( N2B27 R1 ) ( Fig . 1a , b ) . After 4 days in culture , we found the number of SSEA - 1 1 / OCT4 1 cells dramatically increased in N2B27 R1 compared to F / A - based medium ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) . However , a significant fraction of SSEA - 1 2 / OCT4 2 cells was still detected . Next we tested the combination of either Activin - A / IWR1 ( N2B27 A / R1 ) or FGF2 / IWR1 ( N2B27 F / R1 ) . Notably , while a compar - able level of differentiation was observed in N2B27 A / R1 versus N2B27 R1 , day 4 epiblast outgrowths in N2B27 F / R1 showed homogen - ous morphology and little - to - no differentiation ( Fig . 1b , c and Extended Data Fig . 1b , c ) . Mechanistically , the combination of the serum - free N2B27 medium , IWR1 and FGF2 suppressed lineage * Theseauthorscontributedequallytothiswork . 1 TheSalkInstituteforBiologicalStudies , GeneExpressionLaboratory , LaJolla , California92037 , USA . 2 HowardHughesMedicalInstitute , TheSalkInstituteforBiologicalStudies , LaJolla , California92037 , USA . 3 TheSalkInstituteforBiologicalStudies , GenomicAnalysisLaboratory , LaJolla , California92037 , USA . 4 TheSalkInstituteforBiologicalStudies , IntegratedGenomics , LaJolla , California92037 , USA . 5 LudwigInstituteforCancerResearch , UniversityofCalifornia , SanDiegoSchoolofMedicine , DepartmentofCellularandMolecularMedicine , 9500GilmanDrive , LaJolla , California92093 - 0653 , USA . 6 Life ScienceCenter , TsukubaAdvancedResearchAlliance , UniversityofTsukuba , 1 - 1 - 1Tennoudai , Tsukuba , Ibaraki305 - 8577 , Japan . 7 Grado enMedicina , UniversidadCato´lica , SanAntoniodeMurcia , CampusdelosJero´nimos , 135 , Guadalupe30107 , Spain . 8 FundacionPedroGuillen , Clı´nicaCemtro , AvenidaVentisquerodelaCondesa , 42 , 28035Madrid , Spain . 9 HospitalClinicofBarcelona , Carrer Villarroel , 170 , 08036Barcelona , Spain . 10 UniversityofCalifornia , Davis , Davis , California95616 , USA . 11 TheSalkInstituteforBiologicalStudies , PeptideBiologyLaboratory , LaJolla , California92037 , USA . { Presentaddress : Departmentof AdvancedBioscience , GraduateSchoolofAgriculture , KinkiUniversity , 3327 - 204Nakamachi , Nara631 - 8505 , Japan . 0 0 M O N T H 2 0 1 5 | V O L 0 0 0 | N AT U R E | 1 G 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved differentiation and arrested the majority of , if not all , epiblast cells in a proliferative state , with homogenous expression of the pluripotency markers OCT4 and SSEA - 1 ( Fig . 1d and Extended Data Fig . 2a , b ) . A spatially defined pluripotent state Upon passaging with collagenase type IV , traditionally used for EpiSCs , we could derive stable cell lines under N2B27 F / R1 , referred to as EpiSCs F / R1 . Surprisingly , EpiSCs F / R1 could also be efficiently derived after trypsin disaggregation of day 4 epiblast outgrowths ( Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . In addition to IWR1 , we could also obtain stable cell lines using other Wnt inhibitors XAV939 and IWP2 ( Extended Data Fig . 3i , j ) . In our experiments , the derivation success rate with F / A culture is around 33 % , similar to a recent report 6 . In contrast , we could readily obtain stable EpiSCs F / R1 from different genetic backgrounds and different developmental stages of post - implantation as well as pre - implantation epiblasts , even after the first passage with a derivation success rate of 100 % ( Extended Data Fig . 3b , c , e ) , a feat not possible with F / A culture 5 , 19 . Moreover , N2B27 F / R1 equally supported the derivation of EpiSCs F / R1 from four micro - dis - sected quadrants ( anterior - proximal , anterior - distal , posterior - prox - imal and posterior - distal ) of E6 . 5 epiblasts with a perfect success rate ( Extended Data Fig . 3f , g ) . This uniform response suggests that N2B27 F / R1 captures a pluripotent state accessible to all in vivo plur - ipotent epiblast cells of diverse spatiotemporal origins . EpiSCs F / R1 could be maintained long term in culture while display - ing homogenous morphology and a normal karyotype ( Fig . 1c and Extended Data Fig . 4f ) . EpiSCs F / R1 derived from different devel - opmental stages and different regions exhibited gene expression pat - terns characteristic of the primed - state PSCs ( Extended Data Figs 3d , h and 4a ) . EpiSCs F / R1 expressed standard pluripotent protein markers and possessed weak alkaline phosphatase activity ( Extended Data Fig . 4b , c , g ) . Epigenetically , EpiSCs F / R1 exhibited X - chromosome inac - tivation in female cells ( Fig . 2a and Extended Data Fig . 4b ) , demethy - lated Oct4 ( also known as Pou5f1 ) promoter and fully methylated Stella ( also known as Dppa3 ) and Dppa5 promoters ( Extended Data Fig . 4d ) . We found that self - renewal of EpiSCs F / R1 was dependent on balanced signalling of FGF2 and IWR1 ( Extended Data Fig . 5a – c ) . Pluripotency of EpiSCs F / R1 was demonstrated with in vivo teratoma assays and we observed that the sizes of teratomas derived from EpiSCs F / R1 were smaller than those derived from EpiSCs ( Extended Data Fig . 4i – k ) . Collectively , these results indicate that EpiSCs F / R1 bear properties characteristic of the primed pluripotent state . Low clonogenicity is regarded as one of the prominent features of primed EpiSCs . In contrast , EpiSCs F / R1 showed high cloning effi - ciency ( , 34 . 2 % ) at a comparable level to ESCs ( , 41 . 3 % ) and much higher than EpiSCs ( , 1 . 1 % ) ( Fig . 2b and Extended Data Fig . 4e ) 15 , 20 . Other notable differences between EpiSCs F / R1 and EpiSCs are prolif - eration rate and doubling time . EpiSCs F / R1 proliferate at a much faster pace than EpiSCs ( Fig . 2c ) . The doubling time of EpiSCs F / R1 ( 8 – 10 h ) is markedly shorter than that of EpiSCs ( 14 – 16 h ) and this is probably due to a shortened G1 phase ( Extended Data Fig . 4h ) . Metabolically , we found EpiSCs F / R1 were more dependent on glycolysis and less on mitochondrial respiration than already highly glycolytic EpiSCs 8 ( Extended Data Fig . 7a – g ) , which might support their fast growth rate . The high cloning efficiency , rapid proliferation rate and a more glycolytic metabolic profile suggest that EpiSCs F / R1 exist in a primed pluripotent state distinct from that of the conventional EpiSCs . Naive mouse ESCs ( mESCs ) differ from primed EpiSCs in their ability to generate chimaeras following blastocyst injection . Post - implantation embryos , however , constitute a non - permissive envir - onment for ICM - derived mESCs , and hence , grafted mESCs proliferate poorly 21 . To phenotypically evaluate the pluripotent state of EpiSCs F / R1 , we first performed blastocyst injections . We did not observe any chimaera contribution from EpiSCs F / R1 , further sup - porting the notion that EpiSCs F / R1 are in a primed pluripotent state . Although incapable of colonizing pre - implantation ICMs , EpiSCs could readily incorporate and generate chimaeras when grafted into post - implantation epiblasts followed by in vitro embryo culture 21 . Tofunctionallydefine EpiSCs F / R1 wegrafted Kusabira - Orange - labelled EpiSCs F / R1 into different regions of isolated , non - intact E7 . 5 embryos ( anterior , distal and posterior ) ( Fig . 2d ) . Unlike conventional EpiSCs , which incorporated efficiently in the distal ( 10 / 12 ) and posterior ( 8 / 10 ) regions and to a lesser extent the anterior region ( 6 / 10 ) , an observation consistent with previous reports 6 , 15 , 21 , EpiSCs F / R1 only integrated effi - ciently in the posterior epiblast ( 22 / 25 ) . They poorly integrated in the anterior region ( 3 / 12 ) and not at all in the distal region ( 0 / 12 ) . More importantly , after 36 h of embryo culture only EpiSCs F / R1 grafted to the posterior region could disperse from graft sites , proliferate and differ - entiate into the three germ layers in chimaeric embryos ( Fig . 2e – g and Extended Data Fig . 4m ) . These results not only confirmed the plur - ipotency of EpiSC F / R1 , but also revealed a preferential affinity and high compatibilitybetweenEpiSCs F / R1 andtheposteriorE7 . 5epiblast . Based on this unique embryo grafting property , we named EpiSCs F / R1 as region - selectiveEpiSCs , orrsEpiSCs . Divergentgraftingoutcomes indi - cate that rsEpiSCs represent a class of primed - state PSCs with a new spatial identity distinct from conventional EpiSCs . Multiple omics comparisons of PSCs We compared the transcriptomes of mESCs , EpiSCs , rsEpiSCs and in vivo isolated epiblasts using microarrays . Principle component ana - lysis ( PCA ) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis showed that rsEpiSCs clustered tightly as a group separated from both mESCs and EpiSCs , indicating that rsEpiSCs acquired a distinct global tran - scriptome profile ( Fig . 3a and Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . Comparative analysis of RNA - seq data identified 2 , 245 genes differentially expressed between rsEpiSCs and EpiSCs using a fourfold cut - off ( FDR , 0 . 05 , Extended Data Fig . 6b and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Notable gene ontology ( GO ) terms enriched in genes upregulated in rsEpiSCs were related to neuron differentiation and development ( Extended Data Fig . 6c ) . FACS analyses of teratomas , however , revealed no obvious lineage biases between EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs Pluripotent Epiblast Cells c b a Isolated epiblasts E5 . 75 embryos 250 µ m N2B27 KSR + F / A N2B27 F / R1 D a y 1 D a y 4 P 10 250 µ m N2B27 KSR + F / A N2B27 F / R1 O C T 4 D AP I SS E A - 1 Day 4 outgrowth 500 µ m d E5 . 75 embryo Pluripotent epiblast cells Isolation of epiblast Culture in N2B27 media Outgrowth of epiblast + IWR1 Serum free + FGF2 Serum free IWR1 FGF2 Mesodermalcells Endodermalcells Ectodermalcells Figure 1 | The effects of culture parameters on epiblast explants . a , Freshly collected E5 . 75 mouse embryos ( top ) and isolated E5 . 75 epiblasts ( bottom ) . b , Immunostaining of day 4 epiblast outgrowths .

All rights reserved ( Extended Data Fig . 4l ) . Other prevalent GO terms were associated with cell motion , extracellular matrix and plasma membrane . This is reminiscent of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) that takes place during gastrulation . We further explored thispossibility by analysing the levels of E - CADHERIN , CLAUDIN - 3 and SNAIL , pro - teins integral to the EMT process . Notably , we detected reduced expressions of both E - CADHERIN and CLAUDIN - 3 and a concom - itant increase in SNAIL expression , suggesting that the EMT process might have been initiated in rsEpiSCs ( Fig . 4b ) . It is interesting to note that , consistent with the metabolic flux analysis , gene expression levels of enzymes and complexes involved in glycolysis were higher in rsEpiSCs versus EpiSCs , and those related to mitochondrial func - tion were lower in rsEpiSCs versus EpiSCs ( Extended Data Fig . 7h ) . ChIP - seq analysis revealed that the global histone 3 lysine 4 tri - methylation ( H3K4me3 ) distribution pattern was similar between EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs while a significant increase of H3K27me3 levels was detected at the transcription start site of polycomb group target genes in rsEpiSCs ( Fig . 3b , Extended Data Fig . 6d , http : / / neomorph . - salk . edu / rsEpiSC / browser . html ) . The genomes of both EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs are highly methylated in CG contexts ( , 87 % , Extended Data Fig . 6f ) . The genome - wide discovery of differentially methylated regions ( DMRs ) identified 1 , 336 DMRs between EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs with the vast majority ( 88 . 3 % ) showing hyper - methylation in rsEpiSCs . Of these rsEpiSCs hyper - DMRs , 53 . 8 % ( 635 / 1 , 180 ) were located within 2 . 5 kilobases of the transcription start site ( Extended Data Fig . 6f ) . rsEpiSCs hyper - DMRs were strongly enriched at CpG - island - containing promoters ( P 5 2 . 14 3 10 2 88 ) . A subset of genes ( cluster 3 ) associated with complete promoter methylation and concomitant loss of H3K4me3 in rsEpiSCs was accompanied by reduced expression levels ( 48 % of genes in cluster 3 , P 5 1 . 6 3 10 2 8 , Fig . 3c ) . Consistent with the selective engraftment of rsEpiSCs to the posterior epiblast , genes associated with rsEpiSCs hyper - DMRs were enriched for GO terms such as regionalization and anterior / posterior pattern specification ( Extended Data Fig . 6h ) . In both EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs , we observed a positive correlation between gene expression and non - CG methylation levels in the gene body , characteristic of pluripotent cells 22 ( Extended Data Fig . 6g ) . Consistent with transcriptomic analysis , genes related to cell mem - brane and neuronal lineage exhibited distinct patterns while pluripo - tency - related genes remained comparable in DNA methylation and / or histone methylation levels between EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs ( Extended Data Fig . 6e ) . Untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics analysis quantified dif - ferences in hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites , respectively , between EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs . Several hundred metabolites were identified as being different between the two cell lines using XCMS online 23 and the METLIN database 24 ( Extended Data Fig . 7i , j and Supplementary Tables 2 – 7 ) . The data show broad changes in meta - bolite levels including increased tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and lower levels of lipids in EpiSCs , indicating increased energy util - ization in these processes . The increased tricarboxylic acid cycle usage is in line with a higher mitochondria respiration rate in EpiSCs than a b Cellclump A D P KO - labelled ( 1 ) EpiSCs ( 2 ) rsEpiSCs g D i s t a l P o s t e r i o r EpiSCs A n t e r i o r P o s t e r i o r rsEpiSCs D i s t a l A n t e r i o r 250 μ m EpiSCs rsEpiSCs ESCs Xist DAPI 10 μ m d f M e s o d e r m T 125 μm Kusabira - Orange SOX2 E c t o d e r m E n d o d e r m Merge ( with DAPI ) r s E p i S C s FOXA2 Days EpiSCsrsEpiSCs 1 , 000 1 2 100 10 1 0 3 4 A v e r a g e f o l d i n c r ea s e ( r e l a t i v e t o d a y 1 ) c e * * * * 34 . 2 10 . 5 1 . 1 41 . 3 E p i S C s E p i S C s ( + Y 27632 ) r s E p i S C s E S C s 40 30 20 10 0 C l o n i n g e f fi c i e n c y ( % ) 50 EpiSCs rsEpiSCs A n t e r i o r n = 10 D i s t a l n = 12 P o s t e r i o r n = 10 A n t e r i o r n = 12 D i s t a l n = 12 P o s t e r i o r n = 25 88 . 0 0 . 0 33 . 3 80 . 0 83 . 3 60 . 0 483 0 64 356 351 170 98 . 8 0 . 0 10 . 5 75 . 5 54 . 0 23 . 8 * * * * * * * * * * 50 25 700 350 0 L e n g t h o f d i s t r i b u t i o n ( μ m ) 0 150 50 0 N o . o f ce ll s i n e m b r y o 100 75 100 I n c o r p o r a t i o n e f fi c i e n c y ( % ) Figure 2 | Characterization of rsEpiSCs . a , Xist RNA FISH signals in female mouseESCs , EpiSCsandrsEpiSCs .

All rights reserved rsEpiSCs . Also , rsEpiSCs contained less glucose and more glucose - 6 - phosphate compared to EpiSCs , which correlates with the higher glycolytic activity in rsEpiSCs as determined by medium acidification measurements . Collectively these multi - omic results distinguish rsEpiSCs from EpiSCs at the transcriptomic , epigenomic and metabolic levels , fur - ther underlining their contrasting attributes despite both existing in the primed pluripotent state . In vivo relevance of rsEpiSCs To investigate which region ( s ) of the in vivo epiblast rsEpiSCs may resemble , we performed RNA - seq on four dissected regions of the late E6 . 5 epiblast ( anterior - proximal , anterior - distal , posterior - proximal and posterior - distal ) and compared differentially expressed genes among in vivo samples with rsEpiSCs . Spearman’s rank correlation revealed that in vivo posterior - proximal epiblast had a higher correla - tion with rsEpiSCs than other epiblast quadrants , suggesting that rsEpiSCs might have acquired cellular properties characteristic of the posterior - proximal epiblast ( Fig . 4a ) . To reveal the temporal identity of rsEpiSCs , we first tested the ability of rsEpiSCs to be induced into primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) . Epiblasts acquire the ability to adopt a PGC fate in response to BMP4 between developmental stages E5 . 5 and E6 . 5 25 , 26 . We did not observe any PGC induction in rsEpiSCs following an established protocol 13 ( Extended Data Fig . 6l ) , suggesting that they do not resemble in vivo epiblasts during this period . To help dissect which developmental stage rsEpiSCs most closely relate to , we next compared the transcriptomes of rsEpiSCs to those of epiblasts isolated from different embryological timelines from a published data set 6 . PCA and hierarchical clustering analysisrevealed thatgeneexpression profilesofrsEpiSCsare similar to epiblast from late - streak / no - bud - stage embryos 27 ( Extended Data Fig . 6i , j ) . This prompted us to investigate whether rsEpiSCs acquired prim - itive streak cellular properties by comparing rsEpiSCs and in vivo late - streak epiblast transcriptomes for an annotated list of primitive marker genes 6 , 28 , 29 . We found almost all primitive streak - related genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in rsEpiSCs compared to in vivo late - streakepiblast , indicatingrsEpiSCshad not acquiredthemolecular properties of primitive streak cells ( Extended Data Fig . 6k ) . To functionally time rsEpiSCs , we focused on their unusually high cloning efficiency and tested clonal derivation of rsEpiSCs by directly trypsinizing isolated epiblasts . When starting with E7 . 5 epiblasts , a few OCT4 - positive colonies appeared after 7 day’s culture . In contrast , we did not observe any colony forming with E6 . 5 epiblasts ( Fig . 4c – e ) . These results indicate that some in vivo E7 . 5 epiblast cells acquired resistance to apoptosis after single - cell enzymatic dissociation , a prop - erty shared by rsEpiSCs . This may be attributed to the EMT occurring during gastrulation when posterior - proximal epithelial epiblast cells delaminate and ingress through the primitive streak to form mesoen - doderm 30 . Taken together , these findings suggest that rsEpiSCs may represent a subpopulation of cells from the late - streak / no - bud - stage epiblast undergoing EMT before their lineage commitment . Primate region - selective PSCs Notwithstanding their blastocyst origin , human ESCs exist in a primed pluripotent state similar to mouse EpiSCs , a state that suffers from several practical disadvantages , including low derivation and cloning efficiency . When human ESCs were cultured in F / R1 condi - tions we observed long - term self - renewal and karyotypic stability ( Fig . 5a and Extended Data Fig . 8e ) .

All rights reserved standard pluripotency markers ( Fig . 5a and Extended Data Fig . 8a , c , m ) , harboured a reduced population of cells retained at the G1 phase ( Extended Data Fig . 8l ) and generated teratomas in NOD / SCID mice comprising the three germ lineages ( Extended Data Fig . 8d ) . Similar to mouse rsEpiSCs , the cloning efficiency of human rsESCs was sig - nificantly improved ( Fig . 5b and Extended Data Fig . 8b ) , which greatly facilitated genome editing at a comparable level to Y27632 - treated conventional human ESCs ( Extended Data Fig . 9a – d ) . F / R1 culture also supported generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) . Notably , compared to F / A culture , putative iPSC - like colonies in F / R1 culture were more homogenous , bigger in size and contained less colonies with partial / absent alkaline phosphatase activ - ity ( Extended Data Fig . 8g – i ) . F / R1 culture also supported long - term culture of non - human primate ( NHP ) PSCs including rhesus macaque PSCs 31 and chimpan - zee iPSCs 32 ( Fig . 5a and Extended Data Fig . 10a , b ) . The cloning efficiency of NHP rsESCs was also improved ( Fig . 5b ) . Hierarchical clustering of the trancriptome analysed using RNA - seq showed that primate rsPSCs were clustered together in a group distinct from con - ventional primate PSCs in F / A culture ( Fig . 5c ) . To functionally test whether primate rsPSCs acquired phenotypic properties characteristic of mouse rsEpiSCs , we grafted green fluor - escent protein ( GFP ) - labelled human H9 ESCs or H9 rsESCs into the anterior , distal and posterior regions of epiblasts of isolated non - intact E7 . 5 mouse embryos ( see Methods ) . Conventional H9 ESCs could not efficiently integrate and proliferate inside mouse epiblasts regardless of their grafting sites . In rare cases when few H9 ESCs were detected , they remained undifferentiated , as indicated by positive staining for OCT4 ( Fig . 5d – f ) . This indicates that unlike mouse EpiSCs , human H9 ESCs are incompatible with mouse post - implantation epiblasts . In contrast , H9 rsESCs efficiently integrated , proliferated and differentiated into all three germ layers when grafted in the posterior region , remained undif - ferentiated as clusters in the anterior region and showed no incorpora - tion in the distal region of the E7 . 5 mouse epiblasts , consistent with mouse rsEpiSCs ( Fig . 5d – f ) . In addition to human cells , we observed similar engrafting patterns with GFP - labelled rhesus macaque rsESCs ( Extended Data Fig . 10d – f ) , indicating that F / R1 culture endowed sim - ilar phenotypic features to NHP ESCs . Pluripotency , an evanescent feature of early embryonic develop - ment , permeates epiblast cells of diverse spatiotemporal orgins 33 . Nevertheless , distinct pluripotent states have been described and distinguished along the embryological timeline without regard to spatial attributes . Although post - implantation pluripotent epiblast cells are not irreversibly committed , they are spatially polarized under the influence of local milieus provided by surrounding extra - embryonic tissues 34 . The regional properties of post - implantation epiblast cells have largely been overlooked in EpiSCs . By refining culture parameters , we have captured cells of spatially defined plur - ipotency that harbour molecular , epigenetic and metabolic signa - tures that differ from conventional EpiSCs . Our study sets a precedent for exploring other spatially distinct pluripotent states in the early embryo .

All rights reserved Compared to naive cells , primed PSCs exist in a more devel - opmentally advanced state and are poised for rapid and efficient differentiation . This advantage , however , is overshadowed by the heterogeneity and poor cloning efficiency associated with the conven - tional F / A culture . F / R1 culture boosts cloning efficiency , simplifies routine cultivation , improves the quality of iPSC generations , and facilitates genome editing in primed human PSCs . These features are attractive for a myriad of applications such as synchronized and efficient differentiation , large - scale cell production , and gene - correc - tion for disease modelling and therapeutic purposes . In addition , the ability of human rsESCs to differentiate into derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers in chimaeric embryos provides us with a novel platform to study early human developmental events that are other - wise difficult to investigate , such as gastrulation and early lineage commitment , presumed , but not yet fully proven , to be conserved between human and other animal model organisms . The capture and engineering of PSCs with distinct features 35 , 36 may enrich our fundamental understanding of pluripotency in mammalian develop - ment and evolution , as well as expand the repertoire of cellular tools that can be harnessed for regenerative medicine applications .

Epiblast isolation from post - implantation embryos . Timed - pregnant mice were euthanized for embryo collection at appropriate developmental stages between E5 . 25 and E7 . 75 . To isolate epiblasts , embryos were first dissected out from decidua . Rechert’s membrane , extra - embryonic ectoderm and visceral endoderm were carefully removed mechanically with fine forceps and a tungsten needle . The embryo isolation procedures were performed in media containing DMEM ( Gibco ) , 10 % FBS ( Hyclone ) and 1 3 penicillin – streptomycin ( Gibco ) . For isolation of epiblast from stage E7 . 25 and E7 . 5 embryos , an additional step was taken to mechanically remove the mesodermal layer . Staging of embryos was performed as previously described 26 , 40 . Derivation and culture of mouse rsEpiSC lines . For rsEpiSCs derivation , epi - blasts from E5 . 25 to E7 . 5 post - implantation mouse embryos were isolated by mechanically removal of Rechert’s membrane , visceral endoderm as well as extra - embryonic ectoderm using fine forceps and a tungsten needle . In the case of stage E7 . 25 and E7 . 5 embryos , the mesodermal layer was also mechanically removed with a tungsten needle . Isolated epiblasts were placed on MEFs in chem - ically definedN2B27medium 41 supplemented withFGF2 ( 20 ng ml 2 1 , Peprotech ) andIWR1 ( 2 . 5 m M , SigmaAldrich ) . After4day’sculture , epiblastoutgrowthswere dissociated with TrypLE ( Life Technologies ) and replated onto newly prepared MEFs in one well of a 12 - well plate . rsEpiSCs were passaged every 3 – 4 days with TrypLEatasplitratioof1 : 50 . ForclonalderivationofrsEpiSCsfromE6 . 5andE7 . 5 embryos , isolated epiblasts were treated with trypsin - EDTA ( 0 . 25 % , Life Technologies ) for10minat37 u C followedbyrepeatedpipetting ( , 40times ) with aP200pipette .

Timed - pregnant mice were euthanized for blastocyst collection at E3 . 5 . Zona pellucidae were first removed fromE3 . 5 blastocysts after brief treatment with acidic Tyrode’ssolution ( Millipore MR - 004 - D ) . ICMs were isolated using immunosurgery . In brief , to remove the trophectoderm layer , blastocysts were incubated with rabbit anti - mouse serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) followed by guinea pig complement ( Sigma - Aldrich ) treatment . The trophectoderm layer was removed by repeated pipetting and ICMs were plated onto MEFs and cultured in N2B27 F / R1 medium . After 5 day’s culture , ICM outgrowths were passaged using TrypLE ( Life Technologies ) and plated onto newly prepared MEFs . Derivation and culture of mouse ESC lines . Embryo manipulations were per - formedunderadissectingmicroscope ( OlympusSZX10 ) . Blastocyststageembryos were collected from timed - pregnant mice at E3 . 5 and used for ESC derivation . In brief , zona pellucidae were removed by brief treatment with acidic Tyrode’s solu - tion ( Millipore MR - 004 - D ) . After removing zona pellucidae , embryos were plated on MEF in N2B27 2ILIF medium : N2B27 basal medium supplemented with human leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) ( 10 ng ml 2 1 , Peprotech ) , 3 m M CHIR99021 ( Selleckchem ) and 1 m M PD035901 ( Selleckchem ) .

Established mouse EpiSCs were cultured in EpiSC culture media : N2B27 basal medium , 20 % KnockOut serum replacement ( KSR ) , 2 ng ml 2 1 Activin - A and 12 ng ml 2 1 FGF2 . EpiSCs were cultured on MEF or FBS ( Hyclone ) coated plates and passaged using collagenase IV every 4 – 5 days . Immunofluorescence . For immunofluorescence studies , isolated epiblasts and cells grown on chamber slides ( BD Falcon ) were fixed with freshly prepared 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature , and permeabilized / blocked with 1 % Triton - X in PBS - contained 10 % FBS for 1 h at room temper - ature . Thecellswereincubatedwithprimaryantibodiesin1 % FBS , 0 . 1 % Triton - X in PBS overnight at 4 u C . The next day , cells were washed and incubated with fluorescent - labelled secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) at 1 : 500 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature . Cells were washed and mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI ( Vector Labs ) . Whole - mount staining of cultured embryos was per - formed as previously described 26 .

At5min , concomitant with the increase in flow rate , the gradient was increased from 0 % B to 20 % B . The gradient increased linearly to 100 % B at 45 min , followed by an 8 - min wash at 0 . 5 ml per min with 100 % B before re - equilibrating the column with 0 % B for 7 min . Mass spectrometryanalysis wasperformed using an Agilent 6220 ESI - TOF fitted with an electrospray ionization ( ESI ) source . The capillary voltage was set to 3 , 500 kV and the fragmentor voltage to 100 V . The drying gas temperature was set to 350 u C at a flow rate of 10 l per min with a nebulizer pressure set to 45 p . s . i . Untargeted data were collected using a mass - to - charge range of m / z 100 – 1 , 500 . Mass spectrometry data analysis . Data analysis was performed with XCMS online to identify changing metabolites between samples . Samples ( EpiSCs and rsEpiSCs ) were compared and differences were ranked according to statistical significance as calculated by an unpaired Student’s t test . For the volcano plot , data were obtained from the 60 - min profiling analysis in negative and positive mode and the data were filtered based on retention time range ( 5 – 40 min ) and abundance ( . 5 3 10 3 counts ) . For the metabolite and lipid identification each ionwasinspectedtoensurethatthedifferencesidentifiedbyXCMSwerereflectedintherawdata . Many of the ions in the volcano plots belonged to di - , tri - and tetrapeptides and were not annotated in our final metabolite lists . The metabolite IDs listed are based on metabolites in the METLIN database that are within 5 p . p . m . of the experimental mass measured . This is all done automatically in XCMS online . In several cases , more than one metabolite is identified for a given mass because they all have the same formula . Where required we selected the metabolite that was most appropriate ( that is , a mammalian metabolite versus a drug with the same formula ) and listed that metabolite . 38 . Yoshimizu , T . et al .
