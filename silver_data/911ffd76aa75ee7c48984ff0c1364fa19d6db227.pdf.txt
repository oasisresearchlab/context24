Chapter 18 Receptor Dynamics in Signaling Verena Becker , Jens Timmer , and Ursula Klingm¨uller Abstract Reliable inter - and intracellular communication is central to both the development and the integrity of multicellular organisms . Key mediators of these processes are cell surface receptors that perceive and convert extracellular cues to trigger intracellular signaling networks and ultimately a phenotypic response . Deregulation of signal transduction leads to a variety of diseases , and aberrations in receptor proteins are very common in various cancer types . Therefore , cell surface receptors have been established as major targets in drug discovery . However , in order to efﬁciently apply therapeutics , it is crucial to gain knowledge about design principles of receptor signaling . In this chapter , we will discuss signal transduction at the receptor level for examples from different receptor classes . 1 Introduction Tightly regulated cellular communication is key not only to the development of multicellular organisms but also to the functional integrity of tissues , organs , V .

Becker et al . Fig . 18 . 1 Generalized scheme of ligand and receptor interaction and trafﬁcking processes and the whole body . There are a plethora of mediators involved in cell - to - cell communications such as small molecules , peptides , cytokines , growth factors , lipid hormones , and physical signals . These molecules bind to speciﬁc cell surface receptors , which initiate signal transmission by linking extracellular cues to intra - cellular cascades of signaling molecules . Integration of different signal transduction networks via crosstalk of intersecting pathways processes the information and ﬁnally leads to appropriate phenotypic responses of the cell such as proliferation , differentiation , migration , survival , or apoptosis . Aberrations in signaling cascades are linked to various disease types including cancer , infections , as well as immunological and metabolic disorders . In the advent of targeted therapeutics , cell surface receptors have become prime objectives in drug discovery [ 1 ] , and various antibodies impeding ligand binding or small molecule inhibitors interfering with the enzymatic activity of receptor proteins undergo development or are already used in cancer therapy . However , to efﬁciently apply targeted therapeutics , it is crucial to understand the complex regulation of the underlying biochemical networks [ 2 – 4 ] . Therefore , the identiﬁcation of design principles for cell surface receptor signaling holds great promise in furthering rational drug discovery and personalized therapy strategies . Mathematical models have been established to aid the understanding of how ligand – receptor interaction and trafﬁcking shape receptor activation kinetics [ 5 – 8 ] . In a generalized scheme ( Fig . 18 . 1 ) , ligand undergoes binding to receptor proteins with distinct association . k on / and dissociation . k off / rates .

This generalized model varies with the receptor system under study , and additional processes might be taken into account such as ligand - induced mobilization of newly synthesized receptor from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane . In this review , we will discuss information processing at the receptor level , exem - pliﬁed by the erythropoietin receptor ( EpoR ) , the interleukin 3 receptor ( IL3R ) , the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , and the receptor for transforming growth factor beta ( TGF “ ) . 2 Cytokine Receptors Cytokine receptors are involved in diverse physiological processes such as the devel - opment of the hematopoietic system or in pro - as well as anti - inﬂammatory cellular responses [ 9 , 10 ] . Members of the cytokine receptor family are single membrane - spanning proteins that lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and , therefore , associate with cytoplasmic Janus kinases ( JAK ) . Mutations that constitutively activate cytokine receptors have been described for a variety of hematological disorders , and they are found either in receptor proteins such as the EpoR [ 11 , 12 ] , the granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( GCSF ) receptor [ 13 ] , and the thrombopoietin receptor [ 14 ] , or in receptor - associated kinases such as JAK2 [ 15 ] and JAK1 [ 16 ] . 2 . 1 Erythropoietin Receptor Erythropoietin ( Epo ) signaling [ 17 ] is crucial for the survival , proliferation , and differentiation of erythroid progenitors at the colony - forming unit - erythroid ( CFU - E ) stage [ 18 ] . Crystallographic studies revealed that the EpoR is expressed as a preformed homodimer [ 19 ] . The majority of receptor protein resides in intracellular compartments of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus as shown for both endogenous EpoR in CFU - E cells as well as exogenous EpoR expression in various cell lines [ 20 – 24 ] . Endocytosis and subsequent degradationof ligand – receptorcomplexes have been proposed to downregulate EpoR activity [ 25 ] . Using a kinetic model , ligand - induced endocytosis could be identiﬁed as a mechanism to clear Epo from the extracellular space , and differences in clearance rates between Epo derivatives were assigned to distinct ligand binding rates [ 26 ] . By combining time - resolved quantitative data for ligand - independentand ligand - induced endocytosis with ordinary differential equation - based modeling , design principles of EpoR signaling could be further reﬁned [ 8 ] . Whereas ligand - induced endocytosis plays a major role in shaping early - response kinetics of EpoR phos - phorylation , ligand - independent EpoR turnover at the plasma membrane is crucial 316 V . Becker et al . for a linear conversion of extracellular Epo levels into receptor activation . Both computational and experimental evidence showed that intracellular EpoR pools constitute a reservoir for a continuous replenishment of cell surface receptor , a process that is key to linear information processing . While peak levels of EpoR and JAK2 phosphorylation are saturated at higher ligand concentrations , the duration and thereby the integral of signaling activity of these proteins is increased under such conditions . This principle of dose - to - duration signaling has been analyzed as a means to decode ligand levels beyond saturation and subsequently shown for pheromone sig - naling in yeast at the level of mitogen - activated protein kinases [ 27 ] . In light of this , it will be interesting to examine if the linear relation between extracellular ligand concentration and activation of signaling molecules might be abrogated downstream of the EpoR . Such an observation could indicate at which level EpoR - mediated signaling interacts with other signaling networks through pathway crosstalk , thereby allowing for integration and interpretation of the cellular signaling status . 2 . 2 Interleukin 3 Receptor In contrast to the EpoR , the IL3R consists of a cytokine - speciﬁc alpha chain and the common beta chain , which is shared with cytokine receptors for IL5 and the granulocyte – macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) [ 28 ] . Studying the characteristics of IL3R activation showed that , comparable to the EpoR system , IL3 is rapidly depleted from the medium within the early phase of stimulation [ 8 ] . A second key feature shared by the EpoR and the IL3R is the restimulation capacity of both the receptor and the receptor - associated JAK2 , demonstrating that cells remain ligand - responsive ( Fig . 18 . 2 ) . However , treatment of cells with IL3 resulted in a massive degradation of the common beta chain and JAK2 ( Fig . 18 . 2b ) . This observation indicates that in contrast to the EpoR , the majority of IL3R resides at the plasma membrane where it is accessible for ligand binding . Another key difference between these receptor systems is the IL3 - induced increase of beta chain expression , which may compensate for dramatic receptor degradation after ligand engagement and prevent a refractory state of the cell . In summary , the EpoR and the IL3R reveal comparable characteristics of signaling at the receptor level , i . e . ( 1 ) rapid clearance of ligand from the medium and ( 2 ) receptor recovery at the plasma membrane . However , both receptor systems evolved distinct strategies to accomplish this systems behavior , either employing a constant rapid ligand - independent turnover of the EpoR or a massive ligand - stimulated synthesis of the IL3R ( Fig . 18 . 2 ) . Rapid uptake of ligand from the medium by ligand - induced endocytosis has been discussed to facilitate temporal ﬁdelity of receptor signaling [ 29 , 30 ] . Thus , the combination of rapid ligand depletion with fast cell surface recovery of the EpoR or the IL3R enables the cell to stay in a ligand - responsive state and at the same time promotes a high temporal resolution of extracellular signaling cues . 18 Receptor Dynamics in Signaling 317 Fig . 18 . 2 Comparison of overall systems behavior and strategies employed in ( a ) the EpoR and ( b ) the IL3R system . Immunoblot analysis shows that both receptor systems stay in a ligand - responsive state as judged by receptor and JAK2 phosphorylation after re - addition of ligand . ( b ) Left panel adapted from [ 8 ] 3 Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Members of the receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) family are single - pass trans - membrane proteins that regulate multiple cellular processes such as proliferation , differentiation , migration , angiogenesis , and metabolism [ 31 ] . Conversely , deregu - lation of RTK signaling pathways has been assigned to various human cancers as well as non - malignant diseases [ 32 , 33 ] . After completion of the Humane Genome Project , 58 RTKs have been identiﬁed [ 34 ] including ErbB receptors , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor , and c - Met . The EGFR ( ErbB1 , Her1 ) is a member of the ErbB receptor family and as the prototypical RTK probably the best - studied receptor , also from a systems point of view [ 6 ] . EGFR signaling regulates proliferation and survival in a variety of epithelial cell types , and deregulated signaling through the EGFR is associated with numerous solid tumors [ 35 ] . 318 V . Becker et al . Biochemical studies showed that the EGFR is rapidly internalized from the plasma membrane upon epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulation and subse - quently degraded in the lysosomal compartment . This downregulation is proposed to contribute to signal attenuation [ 36 , 37 ] . However , this observation is context - dependent since stimulation of the EGFR with transforming growth factor ’ ( TGF ’ ) results in receptor recycling rather than in downregulation [ 38 ] due to a higher pH sensitivity of ligand – receptor binding [ 39 ] . Differential binding and trafﬁcking of EGF and TGF ’ have been shown to result in distinct mitogenic potency of EGFR signaling [ 40 ] . This knowledge has also been employed to engineer a more effective variant of EGF [ 41 ] , and a similar study has been carried out for the cytokine GCSF [ 42 ] . Distinct receptor trafﬁcking or binding properties also account for the altered biology of IL2 [ 43 ] and Epo [ 26 ] derivatives , respectively . Comparing the regulatory role of endocytosis in EGFR and EpoR signaling shows that the contribution of endocytic downregulation D , i . e . the ratio of ligand - induced . k e / to ligand - independent . k t / receptor endocytosis , is approximately threefold higher for EGF - stimulated EGFR . D D 7 : 5 / [ 30 ] than for the EpoR system . D D 2 : 3 / [ 8 ] . This is due to both a lower rate of ligand - independent endocytosis and a higher rate for ligand - induced endocytosis of the EGFR compared to the EpoR . Whereas EGF mediated a substantial decrease in half - life and total expression of its receptor [ 44 ] , neither higher levels of Epo nor prolonged exposure to ligand resulted in a change of total EpoR expression [ 8 ] . Thus , ligand - mediated loss of receptor protein at the plasma membrane is much more likely to play a role in attenuation of EGF - stimulated EGFR signaling [ 36 , 37 ] compared to EpoR signaling . In addition , the ratio of ligand - induced endocytosis k e to ligand – receptor dissociation k off is considerably higher for Epo – EpoR compared to EGF – EGFR complexes [ 30 ] . This , in combination with a rapid constitutive receptor turnover , allows the EpoR system to reach a high temporal resolution of sampling extracellular cues , while , at the same time , staying in a ligand - responsive state . 4 Transforming Growth Factor “ Receptor In contrast to cytokine receptors and the EGFR , the TGF “ receptor belongs to the serine / threonine kinase receptor family . Binding of TGF “ ligand induces cooperative complex formation of two receptor subunits , the TGF “ type I and type II receptors . The type II receptor is a constitutively active serine / threonine kinase that , upon ligand binding , activates the dormant TGF “ type I receptor . The type I receptor in turn phosphorylates serine residues of receptor - associated SMAD2 and SMAD3 transcription factors [ 45 ] . TGF “ is mainly involved in the development as well as homeostasis of tissues . Although TGF “ signaling is typically thought of mediating anti - proliferative cues and , therefore , being a tumor suppressor , it can fuel tumor progression at later stages by stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis [ 46 ] . Signaling through SMAD transcription factors is promoted by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , whereas endocytosis via caveolae mediates receptor turnover [ 47 , 48 ] . 18 Receptor Dynamics in Signaling 319 A recent study suggested that caveolae are also involved to differentially trigger the mitogen - activated protein kinase cascade [ 49 ] . Thus , receptor trafﬁcking pos - sesses the capacity to induce distinct biological responses , thereby establishing an additional layer of regulation to TGF “ signal transduction . Mathematical analysis of the TGF “ pathway showed that the connection of receptor activation and trafﬁcking processes allows for sensing absolute and temporal changes in ligand concentrations , regulating signal duration , and controlling cellular responses upon stimulation with multiple ligands [ 7 ] . Another study suggested that the ratio of clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis controls transient versus sustained responses [ 50 ] . Similar to the TGF “ receptor , signaling from endosomes has also been proposed for signaling downstream of RTKs as well as G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCR ) as a mechanism to facilitate temporal and spatial regulation [ 51 ] . 5 Concluding Remarks The examples discussed in this review show that various strategies have evolved to shape signal initiation at the receptor level by ligand – receptor interaction and trafﬁcking kinetics . The physiological impact of distinct trafﬁcking routes and signaling endosomes is still not fully explored as illustrated by controversial results for caveolae - mediated EGFR internalization [ 52 , 53 ] . Deciphering these processes might give rise to an even more complicated picture of how receptor dynamics set the stage for selective regulation of downstream signaling . However , despite these distinct strategies , a unifying regulator of signal transduction at the receptor level appears to be the ratio of ligand - independent and ligand - induced endocytosis and subsequent receptor degradation [ 7 , 8 , 30 ] . Different from homodimeric EpoR , many cytokine receptors are composed of heterotypic subunits . Besides the IL3R that shares its common beta chain with receptors for IL5 and GM - CSF , another subset of cytokine receptors including receptors for IL2 , IL4 , IL7 , IL9 , IL13 , IL15 , and IL21 have a common gamma chain , whereas receptors for e . g . IL6 , IL11 , or LIF engage the gp130 subunit [ 28 ] . This gives rise to potential competition between different receptors for their common chain and additionally , these receptors often signal through the same JAK – STAT cascade . Moreover , induced feedback regulators , for instance members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS ) family , can affect multiple cytokine receptors either directly or indirectly at the level of JAKs or downstream pathway components . Thus , there are numerous layers of cross - regulation in cytokine signaling as exempliﬁed by studies of IL7 signaling [ 54 ] . These phenomena create the necessity to generate complex data and mathematical models , studying the effects of multiple cytokine stimuli or of a speciﬁc stimulus on the activity of various cytokine receptors . Crosstalk also plays a crucial role for EGFR signaling in cancer . The EGFR does not only form hetero - oligomeric structures with other members of the ErbB receptor family , but it is also suggested to directly interact with c - Met [ 55 , 56 ] and to exhibit 320 V . Becker et al . transactivation with c - Met [ 57 ] and GPCRs [ 58 ] at multiple levels . Such interactions are relevant for both drug resistance and cancer progression . Although studies of cell lines exposed to single stimuli give rise to important insights , it will be crucial to expand the analysis of cell signaling towards more phys - iological conditions of multi - factor stimulation for understanding in vivo signaling through cell surface receptors . This also holds true for the repertoire of stimulation schemes : bolus stimulation is a rather non - physiological , yet practical means to examine signal transduction in cell lines . However , the investigation of autocrine or paracrine signaling in the cellular microenvironment or the administration of a constant stimulus at physiological concentrations promises to advance the ﬁeld of signaling research . Here , technical developments such as microﬂuidics [ 59 , 60 ] in combination with mathematical modeling may greatly impact the success of such endeavors and ﬁnally reﬁne strategies for drug discovery [ 3 ] .
