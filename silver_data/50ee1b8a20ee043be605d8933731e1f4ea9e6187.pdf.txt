The role of Arhgap6 in the progression and development of cancer remains nearly unknown . This study aimed at exploring the effects of Arhgap6 on cervical carcinoma . Human cervical cancer cells HeLa and SiHa were transduced with a lentivirus targeting Arhgap6 ( Arhgap6 + ) , while CaSki and C4 - 1 cells were transfected with miRNA . Cell proliferation was identified by Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) . Cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis were identified by flow cytometry . The capacity of cell migration , invasion , and adhesion were detected by Transwell assay . Further , quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) and western blot were used to analyze the expression levels of Arhgap6 and several tumor - related genes . Co - immunoprecipitation assay was performed to validate the interaction between Arhgap6 and Rac3 ( Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 3 ) . Results showed that Arhgap6 inhibited cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and adhe - sion of cervical carcinoma , induced cell apoptosis , and caused cell cycle arrest in the G0 / G1 phase ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 05 ) . Expression of the tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes were up - and down - regulated respectively by Arhgap6 , and Rac3 was proved to be the target of Arhgap6 . Besides , in in vivo assays , tumor size and weight were destructed in Arhgap6 + athymic nude mouse . This study indicated that Arhgap6 may play a role in the treat - ment of cervical cancer as a tumor supressor . Keywords Cervical carcinoma . Arhgap6 . Cell proliferation . Metastasis . Signaling pathway Introduction Cervical carcinoma is the fourth most common cause of death in women , caused by the infections of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) and arising from the cervix [ 1 ] . HPV induces changes in the epigenome and host genome [ 2 ] . If screening tests and a vaccine to prevent HPV infections are available , it will be highly preventable for cervical cancer [ 3 ] . While in the world , about 8 % of the total cancer cases and total deaths from cancer is cervical cancer . Every year , more than 500 , 000 women and 260 , 000 deaths are afflicted by cervical cancer , approximately 70 % of which occurs in developing countries [ 4 ] . Up to now , the altered expression of varieties of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes has been proved to be asso - ciated with cervical cancer [ 2 ] . Metastasis and invasion are widely considered to be important features of malignancy and closely associated with the biological behavior of cancer cell . Actin , as a major component of the cytoskeleton , plays a vital role in cell movement [ 5 , 6 ] , and Ras homology GTPase activation protein 6 ( Arhgap6 ) performs a vital function on the * Yang Liu liuyang @ fudan . edu . cn * Yihua Yin yinyihua @ 51mch . com Junping Li congcong2002 @ sohu . com 1 Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics , Huashan Hospital North , Fudan University , Shanghai 200040 , People ’ s Republic of China 2 Institute of Antibiotics , Huashan Hospital , Fudan University , Shanghai 200040 , People ’ s Republic of China 3 Department of Gynecology , Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital , Tongji University School of Medicine , Shanghai 200040 , People ’ s Republic of China Tumor Biol . ( 2016 ) 37 : 1411 – 1425 DOI 10 . 1007 / s13277 - 015 - 4502 - z regulation of actin polymerization during several cellular pro - cesses , containing tumor cellular [ 7 , 8 ] . Currently , Arhgap6 has been reported to have two independent functions , one as a GTPase - activating protein with specificity for RhoA , and the other as a cytoskeletal protein that promotes actin remodeling [ 9 ] . The RhoGAP6 isoform 1 variant is reported that it may serve as a biomarker for the progression and development of colorectal cancer [ 10 ] . Ochocka et al . [ 11 ] proved that Arhgap6 protein binds to and up - regulates phospholipase C ( PLC ) - delta 1 , the altered activity of which is associated with hypertension . Suzy et al . [ 12 ] propose that Arhgap6 and ma - trix metalloproteinase 15 ( MMP15 ) transcripts are putative markers of endometrial cancers ’ sensitivity to bevacizumab and down - regulate the factors correlating with the responsive - ness of tumor to therapy . Moreover , Arhgap6 also associates with amelogenesis imperfecta [ 13 ] . However , to date , the biological roles of Arhgap6 in cervical cancer are not known . During the study of the relationship between RhoGAP family and tumor , RhoGAPs play critical roles in gene expression , cell control , migration , invasion , and normal development [ 14 , 15 ] . It also has been proved that down - expression of deleted in liver cancer - 1 ( DLC - 1 ) , also known as ARHGAP7 , or DLC - 2 is associated with various cancer types , such as DLC - 1 in ovary , colon , kidney , prostate , breast , and gastric cancer , and DLC - 2 in hepatocellular carcinomas [ 16 , 17 ] . Ad - ditionally , Arhgap9 is implicated in regulating adhesion of hematopoietic cells to the extracellular matrix [ 18 ] . The current study was aimed to explore the expression of Arhgap6 in cervical cancer and the effects of Arhgap6 on cell proliferation , apoptosis , cell cycle and metastasis of cervical cancer cells . Furthermore , we investigated the association between Arhgap6 and several tumor - related genes .

( 2016 ) 37 : 1411 – 1425 tumor growth in vivo was also proved to be effected by overexpressed Arhgap6 . Methods Bioinformatics analysis The gene expression data for the cervical carcinoma projects were obtained at The Cancer Genome Atlas website ( TCGA , https : / / tcga - data . nci . nih . gov / tcga / ) and analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) using GSEA version 2 . 0 from the Broad Institute at MIT . GSEA firstly generated an ordered list of all genes according to their correlation with Arhgap6 expression . Then , a predefined gene set ( signature of gene expression upon perturbation of certain cancer - related gene ) received an enrichment score ( ES ) , a measure of statistical evidence without null hypothesis . With the expression level of Arhgap6 as a phenotype label , B Metric for ranking genes ^ was set to Pearson correlation , and other basic and advanced fields were set to default . Enrichment analysis was performed using the KEGG gene set biological process database ( c2 . KEGG . v4 . 0 ) from the Molecular Signatures Database ( MSigDB ) ( http : / / www . broad . mit . edu / gsea / msigdb / index . jsp ) . Patients and tissue samples To compare the expression levels of Arhgap6 in cervical can - cer tissues and adjacent normal tissues , quantitative real - time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) was performed . Tissues were resected from 37 cervical cancer patients admitted to Shanghai Huashan Hospital when the patients were undergoing definitive sur - gery , with peritumoral tissues within at least 5 cm of the tumor margin . According to the ethics committee guidelines , in - formed and written consent was obtained from all patients or their advisers . And ethical approval for the study was provid - ed by the Independent Ethics Committee , Huashan Hospital . Cell lines The 293Tcells , used for packaging lentivirus , were offered by the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , USA ) . Human cervical cancer lines HeLa , C - 33A , CaSKi , SiHa , and C4 - 1 were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank , Chinese Acade - my of Sciences ( Shanghai , China ) . All the cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( DMEM , Hyclone Company , USA ) , in which 100 U / mL penicillin , 100 μ g / mL streptomycin , and 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco BRL , Rockville , MD , USA ) were supplement - ed . All the incubators ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . , Wal - tham , MA , USA ) were set to 37 °C , 100 % humidity , and 5 % CO 2 . Lentivirus transduction and small interfering RNA transfection For lentivirus transduction , the core plasmid pLVX - AcGFP - C1 ( Clontech ) was used to construct the recombinant plasmid pLVX - AcGFP - C1 - Arhgap6 by way of double enzyme restric - tion and ligation .

( 2016 ) 37 : 1411 – 1425 pMD2G , purchased from Addgene Company , together with the above recombinant plasmid or non - carrier plasmid pLVX - AcGFP - C1 , were transiently transduced into 293T cells ( ATCC , USA ) . As a result , the virus lentivirus Arhgap6 ( Arhgap6 + ) and lentivirus ( negative control , NC ) were obtain - ed and used for the following cell biology behavior assays . The day before transduction , HeLa and SiHa cells were col - lected and seeded in 96 - well culture plates in triplicate at a density of 3×10 5 cells / well and incubated in 100 - μ L antibiot - ic - free medium undisturbed at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . After being cultured for 1 day , the original medium in triplicate was pipetted and replaced by 100 μ L DMEM ( HyClone , SH30024 . 01B ) ( control ) and 100 μ L DMEM containing 0 . 1 μ L lentivirus ( NC ) or containing 0 . 1 μ L lenti - Arhgap6 ( Arhgap6 + ) , respectively . And culture plates were further in - cubated for 12 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h , with each of the time above regarded as one treated group and 0 h as a control . For siRNA transfection , CaSki and C4 - 1 cells in loga - rithmic growth phase were collected , digested by trypsin , counted , and added to a six - well culture plate with 1 ml / well containing 5×10 5 cells / mL . Then , cells were seeded in antibiotic - free medium the day before transfection . After that , cells were transfected with 400 nmol / L Arhgap6 - siRNA or siRNA ( as NC ) using Lipofectamine ™ 2000 ( Invitrogen , Shanghai , China ) according to the instructions . For Arhgap6 - siRNA , RNA oligomers were synthesized in sense and anti - sense directions , containing 19 nucleotides , corresponding to human Arhgap6 at nucleotides 5 ′ - AGGCCUACAGCUUU GUACU - 3 ′ ( NM _ 001287242 . 1 ) . After 24 , 48 , and 72 h , cells were collected respectively , with each of the time regarded as one treated group and 0 h as a control . Cell growth and proliferation assay Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK8 , SAB Company , USA ) was used to assess the effects of Arhgap6 on the viability of HeLa and SiHa cells . CCK - 8 reagent was added to each group of wells with 1 : 10 ( v / v ) per 100 μ L medium after cells were transfected for 0 , 12 , 48 , and 72 h . All cells were further cultured in the incubator for 1 h before the endpoint of incubation . The optical density ( OD ) at 450 nm was determined for the supernatant of  Fig . 3 Cervical cancer cell growth and proliferation were assessed by CCK8 assay . a HeLa cell and SiHa cell viability was markedly obstructed by overexpressed Arhgap6 in a time - dependent manner . b CaSki and C4 - 1 cells viability was markedly in Arhgap6 - siRNA group in a time - dependent manner . c After 72 h , cell proliferation were significantly weakened or enhanced . n = 3 , mean±SD . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 versus control groups ; # # # p < 0 . 001 versus negative control ( NC ) groups Fig . 4 Overexpressed Arhgap6 - induced apoptosis of HeLa and SiHa cells . a , b Annexin - V / PI assay and flow cytometry analysis were per - formed to substantiate HeLa ( a ) and SiHa ( b ) cell apoptosis . c , d Treat - ment of lenti - Arhgap6 increased the apoptotic population of HeLa cells ( c ) and SiHa cells ( d ) compared with the controls .

Flow cytometry detection To determine the effects of overexpressed Arhgap6 on cervi - cal cancer cell cycle and apoptosis , flow cytometry ( FCM ) ( FACSCalibur , BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) detection was used for cell cycles and cell apoptosis assays . The transduced cells in different groups were collected and trypsinized after transduction for 48 h . For cell cycle assay , propidium iodide ( PI ) ( QiHaiFuTai Bio Com . , Shanghai , China ) and flow cytometry were used . In brief , all cells in different transduced groups were washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and centrifuged to obtain pellets . Then , cells were suspended with 300 μ L PBS contain - ing 10 % FBS and fixed in 700 μ L cold ethanol at − 20 °C for 24 h , washed twice with PBS , and incubated in PBS contain - ing RNase A ( 1 mg / mL ) for 30 min at 37 °C . The samples were stained with 400 μ L PI ( 50 μ g / mL ) for 10 min shielded from light . Finally , all cells were analyzed by flow cytometry at 488 nm and the data were analyzed using CellQuest Soft - ware ( BD Biosciences ) . For cell apoptosis , it was identified by flow cytometry and by using the Annexin V / fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) kit ( BD Biosciences ) . Briefly , about ( 5 – 10 ) ×10 5 transduced cells were collected , centrifuged , and resuspended in 195 - μ L binding buffer containing 5 μ L of Annexin V - APC ( BD Bio - science ) , stained out of the light for 15 min at 4 °C . After centrifugation and resuspension for another time , 10 μ L PI was added , and subsequently , flow cytometric analyses were performed with Annexin V - APC and PI - PE corresponding to the BD detection channel FACS FL4 and FL2 , respectively . Adhesion assays To detect the effect of overexpressed Arhgap6 on cervical cancer cell adhesion , 12 - well plates were used for determining the number of adhesive cells . Cell suspension ( 1×10 5 cells / well ) was added to the well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . After centrifugation , the supernatant was discarded and cells were washed with PBS twice . Adherent cells were fixed with 4 % methanol for 15 min and stained with crystal violet for 30 min . The number of adherent cells from three randomly selected fields ( ×200 microscope , OLYMPUS , Shenzhen , China ) was photographed and counted .

( 2016 ) 37 : 1411 – 1425 Transwell assay Transwell assays were performed to assess the cell ability of migration and invasion after the cells were transduced with Arhgap6 . Briefly , HeLa and SiHa cells in different transduc - tion groups were starved with serum - free DMEM medium for 24 h . Prior to seeding , 24 - well plate and Transwell chamber were soaked for 5 min with 1× PBS . Invasive experiments need to add the following step : The inserts were coated with 80 μ L matrigel ( dilution at 1 : 2 ; BD Bioscience ) and solidified at 37 °C incubator for 30 min . Then , cells were digested for 5 min by 0 . 25 % trypsin ( Gibco , Shanghai , China ) , washed with serum - free medium , and resuspended in medium con - taining 1 % FBS . After counting , cells were diluted to 1× 10 5 cells / ml , seeded in a 24 - plate Transwell room with 1mL / well ; meanwhile , the lower chamber was added with 0 . 75 mL complete medium containing 10 % FBS . Each well was re - peated three times in each group and continued to incubate for 48 h . After that , cells were fixed for 10 min by 1 mL / well of 4 % paraformaldehyde ( JRDUN Biotech , Shanghai , China ) , washed by 1× PBS , and stained by 1 mL 0 . 5 % crystal violet for 30 min , after what , cells were again washed three times by 1× PBS . The Transwell room was wiped carefully without migrating cells using a cotton swab ; and then was placed under a ×200 microscope ( OLYMPUS , Shenzhen , China ) to count the number of the cells . Also , the numbers of invaded cells in five randomly selected high power fields were counted under the microscope . qRT - PCR assay Total RNA samples were isolated using Trizol Reagent ( Invitrogen , Japan ) . cDNA was synthesized from approxi - mately 5 μ g of RNA using AMV reverse transcriptase ( Fermentas , USA ) . qRT - PCR reactions in a 25 - μ L total vol - ume were performed using SYBR ® Green 10× Supermix ( Takara , Japan ) on Roche LightCycler ® 480II System ( Roche Diagnostics Ltd , Switzerland ) . The Primer Express Software ( Applied Biosystems , Shanghai , China ) was used to design primer pairs for human genes ( Table 1 ) with GAPDH as the internal control . The PCR procedure was as follows : 95 °C for 10 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s , 60 °C for 45 s ; one cycle of 95 °C for 15 s , 60 °C for 1 min ; and one cycle of 95 °C for 15 s , 60 °C for 15 s . All PCR reactions were repeated three times , and the relative expression levels of different groups were calculated by normalizing to the mRNA expression level of GAPDH using the 2 - ΔΔ CT method [ 19 ] . Co - immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis In order to explore the function of Arhgap6 on cervical cancer cells in molecular and protein levels , co - immunoprecipitation and western blot assays were performed . The transduced cells in different groups were harvested , washed twice with PBS , lysed in ice - cold radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer ( RIPA , JRDUN , Shanghai , China ) containing 0 . 01 % phos - phatase and protease inhibitor ( Sigma , Shanghai , China ) , and incubated on ice for 30 min . The obtained cell lysates was centrifuged at 4 °C and 13 , 000 rpm for 10 min . The superna - tant was used for protein quantification with BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo , USA ) , and cellular protein in each group was taken into two 1 . 5 - ml centrifuge tubes ( 2 mg per tube ) , in which 2 ug IgG and 2 ug Arhgap6 antibody were added re - spectively . After incubation on ice for 2 h , protein G agarose beads ( Roche , Switzerland ) were added to both of the tubes and supplemented lysates to 1 ml , incubated at 4 °C overnight . The protein in supernatant for western blot detection was ob - tained after centrifugation at 4 °C and 2500 rpm for 1 min , washing the pellet four times with 1 - ml lysates , adding 2× loading buffer ( JRDUN , Shanghai , China ) , and boiling for 5 min , and another centrifugation at 4 °C 2500 rpm for 1 min . The above protein samples together with the no co - precipitated processing cell lysate proteins were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE gel , respectively . Then , cells were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane ( Millipore , Shanghai , China ) . The membranes were blocked with 5 % BSA in TBST and incubated with primary antibodies against Arhgap6 ( Abcam , Ab54839 , 1 : 1000 dilution ) , Rac3 ( Ras - related C3 ) ( Abcam , Ab124943 , 1 : 1000 dilution ) , Snai1 ( Zinc finger protein ) ( CST , # 3879s , 1 : 1000 dilution ) , Cyclin B1 ( CST , # 12231 , 1 : 1000 dilution ) , Twist ( a basic helix – loop – helix transcription factor ) ( Abcam , Ab175430 , 1 : 500 dilution ) , CDH1 ( cadherin 1 ) ( CST , # 14472 ) , RHOA ( Ras ho - molog gene A ) ( CST , # 217 s , 1 : 5000 dilution ) , and GAPDH ( CST , # 5174 , 1 : 1500 dilution ) . Blots were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with goat anti - mouse or anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) , and intensities were measured using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL , Thermo Scientific , Shanghai , China ) . Nude mouse tumorigenicity assay In order to determine whether overexpression of Arhgap6 in cervical cancer cells could reduce tumor growth , nude mouse tumorigenicity assay was performed . HeLa and SiHa cells were washed and resuspended in DMEM without FBS . Cell viability and concentration were determined using trypan blue . Eight male athymic nude mice were randomly divided  Fig . 7 Arhgap6 decreased cell invasion . a , b The number of invasive HeLa and SiHa cells was decreased in Arhgap6 + group cells compared with NC and control groups . c , d The number of invasive CaSki and C4 - 1 cells was increased in Arhgap6 - siRNA group cells compared with the controls . e Arhgap6 decreased cell invasion . n = 3 , mean±SD . * * * p < 0 . 001 versus control groups ; # # # p < 0 . 001 versus negative control ( NC ) groups Tumor Biol .

After about 1 – 2 weeks , the tumor was formed and tumor size and weight were determined every 4 days . Seven weeks later , the mice were euthanized , dissect - ed , and photographed . The tumors were weighted on a digital balance . Statistical analysis Experiments were performed with values expressed as mean± SD . All statistical analyses were conducted using the Graphpad Prism 6 . 0 software . Data were analyzed by t tests . In all statistical comparisons , a P value of less than 0 . 05 was considered to be statistically significant . Results Lower expression of Arhgap6 in tumor tissues than normal tissues We obtained the expression data of Arhgap6 at TCGA for cervical cancer projects and detected the expression levels of Arhgap6 in both cervical cancer tissues and paracancerous tissues from 37 patients . Our results showed that the mRNA levels of Arhgap6 was much lower in tumor tissues ( n = 253 ) than in normal tissues ( n = 22 ) ( Fig . 1a ) . Compared with paracancerous tissues , cervical cancer tissues had an obvious - ly lower expression of Arhgap6 ( Fig . 1b ) ( n = 37 , p < 0 . 01 ) . The results suggested that Arhgap6 probably played a nega - tive role in cervical cancer . Expression of Arhgap6 in cervical cancer cell lines In order to determine which kind of cervical cancer cell line would carry out the investigation of cervical carcinoma cell biology behavior , the mRNA and protein levels of Arhgap6 in various cervical cancer cell lines containing HeLa , C - 33A , CaSKi , SiHa , and C4 - 1were detected by qRT - PCR and west - ern blot . Notably , both the mRNA expression and protein levels of Arhgap6 in HeLa and SiHa cells were much lower than the others , while in CaSki and C4 - 1 cells were much higher ( ( Fig . 2a , b ) ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 01 ) . In addition , western blot assay was performed to detect whether the lenti - Arhgap6 or Arhgap6 - siRNA expressed successfully . The results were shown as follows : the Arhgap6 levels of the lenti - Arhgap6 transduced cells were notably higher in both HeLa ( Fig . 2c ) and SiHa cells ( Fig . 2d ) in comparison with the control and NC group cells . The protein levels of Arhgap6 in Arhgap6 - siRNA group were down - regulated in both CaSki and C4 - 1 cells ( Fig . 2e , f ) which means that the Arhgap6 overexpression system was achieved and could be used for the following studies . Overexpression of Arhgap6 inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis Compared with the unprocessed control and NC group cells , cell viability of both HeLa and SiHa cells was weakened markedly in lenti - Arhgap6 group cells ( Fig . 3a ) , while cell viability of both CaSki and C4 - 1 cells was promoted in siRNA - Arhgap6 group cells ( Fig . 3b ) ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 01 ) , all of which were in a time - dependent manner . Moreover , the mean cell proliferation rates of the cells in transduction for 72 h in HeLa and SiHa cells were significantly obstructed , while in CaSki and C4 - 1 cells were markedly increased compared with that of controls ( Fig . 3c ) ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 01 ) . The results indicated that Arhgap6 inhibits cell viability of cervical cancer cell lines . Further insight into the effects of Arhgap6 on cellular apopto - sis was performed in HeLa and SiHa cell lines . Results showed that the apoptosis rates of HeLa cells in control , NC group , and Arhgap6 + group were 4 . 13 % ±0 . 40 % , 4 . 60 % ± 0 . 30 % , and 34 . 27 % ±1 . 50 % , respectively ( Fig . 4a , b ) , with the apoptosis rates of SiHa cells increasing from 2 . 00 % ± 0 . 53 % to 29 . 20 % ±1 . 08 % in the above three group cells ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 4c , d ) . This indicated that overexpression of Arhgap6 induced apoptosis of cervical cancer cell HeLa and SiHa . Overexpression of Arhgap6 induced cell cycle of HeLa and SiHa arrest at G0 - G1 phase In order to determine the effects of Arhgap6 on HeLa and SiHa cell cycle , PI stain assay and flow cytometry were car - ried out to analyze the cell cycle after HeLa and SiHa cells were treated with the overexpressed Arhgap6 . As shown in Fig . 4 , the percentages of G0 - G1 phase cells in the HeLa control and NC group and Arhgap6 + cell line were 48 . 51 % ±0 . 96 % , 49 . 72 % ±2 . 69 % , and 63 . 68 % ±1 . 55 % , respective - ly , which increased about 5 % ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Similarly , in the SiHa cell line , the percentage of G0 - G1 phase cells in the above three groups was increased from 50 . 40 % ± 1 . 29 % to 63 . 66 % ±0 . 97 % ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 5c , d ) . The results in Arhgap6 - induced cell cycle arrest at G0 - G1 phase suggested that Arhgap6 might induce a specific block in cell cycle progression .  Fig . 8 Arhgap6 decreased cell adhesion . a , b The number of adhesive HeLa and SiHa cells was decreased in Arhgap6 + group cells compared with NC and control groups . c , d The number of adhesive CaSki and C4 - 1 cells was increased in Arhgap6 - siRNA group cells compared with the controls . e Arhgap6 decreased cell adhesion . n = 3 , mean±SD . * * * p < 0 . 001 versus control groups ; # # # p < 0 . 001 versus negative control ( NC ) groups Tumor Biol .

( 2016 ) 37 : 1411 – 1425 Overexpression of Arhgap6 decreased metastasis of HeLa and SiHa Results showed that the cell migration , invasion , and adhesion ability were obviously suppressed after treatment with the overexpressed Arhgap6 in HeLa and SiHa cells , while in CaSki and C4 - 1 cells treated with Arhgap6 - siRNA , these were enhanced ( Figs . 6 , 7 , and8 ) ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Given all the results , we inferred that Arhgap6 could decrease metasta - sis of cervical cancer cells . Identification of genes and signaling associated biological pathways To probe the Arhgap6 - associated pathways and detect the coordinated differences in expression of predefined sets of functionally related genes , GSEA was performed using data from TCGA . Among all the predefined gene sets from KEGG pathways , the cytoskeleton cell viability pathway and tumor cell metastasis pathway were identified with the significant association with Arhgap6 expression in the TCGA data ( Fig . 9a , b ) . To further clarify the mechanism of HeLa and SiHa cells pathways regulated by Arhgap6 , the mRNA ex - pression and protein levels of several tumor - related genes were detected by qRT - PCR and western blot , respectively . As revealed in Fig . 9c , d , overexpressed Arhgap6 evidently decreased the mRNA levels of Cyclin B1 , RHOA , Rac3 , Twist , and Snai1 , but CDH1 was up - regulated ( n = 3 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Likewise , the same results were observed in the detection of protein levels ( Fig . 9e , f ) . Besides , among all the genes , it was verified that Arhgap6 protein bound to and down - regulated the expression of Rac3 ( Fig . 9g , h ) . All the results indicated that the effects of Arhgap6 on cell proliferation , apoptosis , cell cycle , migration , invasion , and adhesion might be via Cyclin B1 , RHOA , Rac3 , CDH1 , Twist , or Snai1 . Overexpression of Arhgap6 suppressed growth of cervical carcinoma in vivo Nude mouse tumorigenicity assay was performed to explore if overexpressed Arhgap6 in cervical cancer cells could reduce tumor growth . After 7 weeks of injection , we found that Arhgap6 - overexpressed tumors grow slower than the NC con - trol cell - injected tumors in mice ( Fig . 10a ) . In all the tumor tissues , there was a higher expression level of Arhgap6 in overexpressed Arhgap6 cell - treated tumor tissues than NC group cell - treated tumor tissues ( Fig . 10b ) .

( 2016 ) 37 : 1411 – 1425 1423 and volume of overexpressed Arhgap6 - treated tumor present - ed lighter and smaller than that of control ( Fig . 10c , d ) . The results suggested that overexpression of Arhgap6 in cervical cancer cells could suppress tumor growth in nude mice . Discussion In this study , we first proved that overexpressed Arhgap6 had tumor - suppressive function and might act as a potential mark - er in cervical cancer . Interestingly , the expression levels of Arhgap6 in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines were much lower in comparison with those of the normal and control , respectively . Our experiments revealed new sight into the function of Arhgap6 . Arhgap6 protein expression was signif - icantly associated with cell viability , apoptosis , cell cycle , me - tastasis , tumor - related genes , and tumor growth . Arhgap6 , as a member of RhoGAPs , is also named Rho GTPase - activating protein 6 ( RhoGAP6 ) . RhoGAPs are emerging as a new class of biomarkers for various cancers [ 20 , 21 ] . RhoGAPs down - regulate active GTP - bound Rho proteins ( Rho GTPases ) , and the involvement of Rho GTPases in major aspects of cancer development has been increasingly reported , containing cell proliferation , polarity , apoptosis , adhesion , invasion , and migration [ 22 ] . Here , our result that Arhgap6 expressed lower in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines was consistent with the previous reports that many RhoGAPs are deleted or lowly expressed in different types of cancers [ 23 ] . However , the functional mechanism about their low expression is still unclear . Thus , we explored the influence of Arhgap6 on cervical cancer cell biology be - havior , with HeLa and SiHa as our study objects , because of their low Arhgap6 expression . And our findings could be sup - ported by many existing related reports . About cell viability , RhoGAP ( Arhgap1 ) can significantly inhibit cell growth of MCF7 cells ( human breast adenocarcinoma cell line ) [ 20 , 24 ] and DLC - 1 ( Arhgap7 ) is also proved to suppress cancer cell growth [ 25 ] , both of which were in agreement with our result that Arhgap6 inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation . About cell cycle and apoptosis , there are no direct reports about RhoGAPs on cancer cells , while as the inhibitor of Rho GTPases , RhoGAPs including Arhgap6 may carry out the opposite effects . Rho GTPases have been reported to evade from cell apoptosis and aggregation [ 26 ] . About cell metastasis , considering that Rho GTPases can be down - regulated by RhoGAPs , the reports that Rho GTPases con - tributes to pathological processes containing cancer cell migration , invasion , and metastasis [ 27 , 28 ] proved our results from the opposite side . Taken together , the above all results determined Arhgap6 as a novel cervical cancer supressor . Further , our nude mouse tumorigenicity assay in vivo proved that Arhgap6 might be a potential therapy target for cervical cancer . In exploring the function of Arhgap6 at the molecular level , we found that cell viability - related genes Cyclin B1 , RHOA , and Rac3 and cell metastasis - related genes CDH1 , Twist , and Snai1 played crucial roles during the process of cell biology behavior triggered by overexpressed Arhgap6 . Moreover , Rac3 was proved to be downregulated by Arhgap6 . Silencing or depletion of Cyclin B1 inhibits human tumor cell prolifer - ation and induces apoptosis [ 29 – 31 ] . Both RHOA and Rac3 are members of Rho GTPase family [ 22 , 26 ] and up - regulated in human tumors , related with cytoskeletal reorganization , cell proliferation , and cell cycle [ 26 ] . Our results that Arhgap6 protein bound to and down - regulated the expression of Rac3 proved that RhoGAPs could inhibit the activity of Rho GTPases in a certain extent and Arhgap6 possibly functioned through interacting with Rac3 . Epithelial - mesenchymal tran - sition ( EMT ) is closely associated with tumor cell metastasis [ 32 , 33 ] . Twist , Snai1 , and the E - cadherin encoded by CDH1 play vital roles in the EMT process [ 34 , 35 ] . Among them , Twist is known as a highly conserved basic helix - loop - helix protein ( bHLH ) transcription factor , promoting EMT and evaluating the prognostic significance of endometrial cancers [ 36 ] . Snai1 , E - cadherin ( CDH1 ) , and zinc finger E - box - binding homeobox 1 ( zeb1 ) genes regulate EMT to initiate the metastasis process of many tumor cells [ 37 ] . Besides , when silencing Snai1 , not only the tumor invasiveness is effectively suppressed but also growth [ 38 ] . G R Stodden et al . hypothesize that the absence of CDH1 and TP53 in endo - metrial cells will exhibit a phenotype indicative of neoplastic transformation [ 39 ] . CDH1 gene is a tumor and tumor metas - tasis suppressor gene and is closely related to the development of many malignant tumors of epithelial origin , invasion , and metastasis [ 40 ] . In our study , both the mRNA expression and protein levels of Cyclin B1 , RHOA , Rac3 , Twist , and Snai1 were decreased in the HeLa and SiHa cells infected with overexpressed Arhgap6 , but CDH1 was up - regulated . Taken together , expression of the tumor suppressor genes and onco - genes is up - and down - regulated respectively by overexpressed Arhgap6 . And this suggested that Arhgap6 may work as a tumor suppressor through the above tumor - regulated genes . Conclusion In our study , we report that the expression of Arhgap6 is down - regulated in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines . Ad - ditionally , Arhgap6 inhibits cell proliferation , arrests cell cycle in the G0 / G1 phase , induces cell apoptosis , and reduces the capacity of cellular adhesion , migration , and invasion . Fur - ther , we find that expression of the tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes is up - and down - regulated respectively in Arhgap6 overexpression cells and Rac3 is proved to be bound with Arhgap6 and down - regulated . Besides , nude mouse 1424 Tumor Biol . ( 2016 ) 37 : 1411 – 1425 tumorigenicity assay reveals that Arhgap6 inhibits tumor growth in vivo . In conclusion , our study indicated that Arhgap6 may work as a tumor suppressor and play a role in the treatment of cervical cancer as a tumor supressor . References 1 .
