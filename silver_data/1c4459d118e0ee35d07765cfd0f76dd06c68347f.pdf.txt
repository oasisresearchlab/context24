However , the molecular driv - ing forces behind these processes are not well understood . Here , we describe a new approach to study curvature sensing , by simulating the direction - dependent interactions of single molecules with a buckled lipid bilayer . We analyse three amphipathic antimicrobial peptides , a class of membrane - associated molecules that speciﬁcally target and destabilize bacterial membranes , and ﬁnd qualita - tively diﬀerent sensing characteristics that would be diﬃcult to resolve with other methods . These ﬁndings provide new insights into the curvature sensing mechanisms of amphipathic peptides and challenge existing theories of hydrophobic insertion .

INTRODUCTION Curvature sensing and generation by membrane pro - teins and lipids is ubiquitous in cell biology , for exam - ple to maintain highly curved shapes of organelles , or drive membrane remodelling processes [ 1 ] . Membrane curvature sensing occurs if a molecule’s binding energy depends on the local curvature [ 2 ] . For proteins , the presence of multiple conformations with diﬀerent curva - ture preferences can couple protein function to membrane curvature [ 3 ] , with interesting but largely unexplored bi - ological implications . Curvature sensing by lipids is often rationalized by a lipid shape factor , classifying lipids as ‘cylindrical’ or ‘conical’ when they prefer ﬂat or curved membranes , re - spectively [ 1 , 2 ] . Membrane proteins oﬀer a wider range of sizes , shapes , and anchoring mechanisms [ 4 ] , and thus potentially more diverse sensing mechanisms . In particu - lar , shape asymmetry implies that the binding energy de - pends on the protein orientation in the membrane plane [ 5 ] , and thus cannot be a function of only mean and Gaus - sian curvature , which are rotationally invariant . This calls for more complex descriptions , and one natural ex - tension is to model the binding energy in terms of the lo - cal curvature tensor C ij in a frame rotating with the pro - tein [ 5 – 11 ] , which allows diﬀerent curvature preferences in diﬀerent directions . For example , a preference for lon - gitudinal curvature is generally associated with proteins ∗ jgomez @ turbula . es † federico . elias . wolﬀ @ dbb . su . se ‡ martin . linden @ icm . uu . se that are curved in this direction , such as BAR domains [ 12 , 13 ] , whereas amphipathic helices [ 14 ] are expected to sense transverse curvature , since their insertion into the membrane - water interface is energetically favored if the membrane curves away in the transverse direction [ 15 – 17 ] . Anisotropic curvature sensing is potentially complex , and theoretical investigations have demonstrated a wide range of qualitative behavior in local curvature mod - els [ 5 – 11 ] , but the models have not been rigorously tested . In principle , the curvature - dependent binding en - ergy landscape E ( C ij ) could be determined by measur - ing the Boltzmann distribution of protein conﬁgurations on curved membranes of known shape . However , cur - rent experimental techniques track only protein positions [ 18 – 24 ] , and hence orientational information is averaged out . Here , we track both position and orientation of sin - gle molecules , using a computational approach based on simulated membrane buckling . The method is applied to three amphipathic antimicro - bial model peptides : magainin , which is found in the skin of the African clawed frog [ 25 ] , melittin , an active com - ponent in bee venom [ 26 ] , and LL - 37 , a peptide derived from the human protein cathelicidin which is involved in the innate immune defense system [ 27 ] . As shown in Fig . 1 , the peptides vary in length and shape , and can thus be expected to display diﬀerent sensing char - acteristics . Many antimicrobial peptides are believed to work by mediating membrane disruption [ 28 ] . The pep - tides studied here are thought to mediate the formation of toroidal membrane pores with a highly curved inner surface partly lined with lipids [ 29 – 34 ] , although the ev - idence appears less clear for LL - 37 [ 35 ] . The ability to stabilize highly curved membrane structures suggests an a r X i v : 1 4 12 . 2371v5 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 1 2 S e p 2016 2 FIG . 1 . Structures of magainin [ 40 ] , melittin [ 41 ] and LL - 37 [ 39 ] . The melittin and LL - 37 structures contain two α - helices that form an angle β ( not the same for both structures ) . The α - helices used in the analysis are colored in blue ( N - terminal ) and orange ( C - terminal ) , with the limiting amino acids la - beled on the structure . Side chain and non - helical residues are colored in gray . intrinsic preference for curved membranes , as is generally expected for amphipathic peptides . Our method uses simulated membrane buckling to sample the unconstrained interaction of single biomolecules with a range of membrane curvatures , and extends previous simulation studies of buckling mechan - ics [ 36 , 37 ] , curvature - dependent folding and binding of amphipathic helices [ 38 ] , and lipid partitioning [ 39 ] . We obtain joint distributions of peptide positions and orien - tations that yield new biophysical insights about curva - ture sensing . The three model peptides display similar rotation - averaged curvature preferences but diﬀer in ori - entational preferences , which demonstrates the value of directional information . The asymmetry of the position - orientational distributions challenges continuum models of amphipathic helices as cylindrical membrane inclu - sions [ 15 , 16 ] . We speculate that such asymmetry is im - portant for certain modes of antibacterial activity , and argue that it might be common also for larger curva - ture sensing proteins . Finally , we discuss the limitations of characterizing curvature sensing mechanisms from as - says with zero Gaussian curvature , and conclude that this uncertainty aﬀects the overall binding energy , but not the orientational preferences . These results motivate eﬀorts to track positions and orientations of membrane proteins experimentally , and to develop assays with a broader range of local curvatures . METHODS To study curvature sensing by single peptides , we sim - ulate their interactions with a buckled membrane using the coarse - grained Martini model [ 42 ] , and track their position and orientation , as shown in Fig . 2 . On a mi - croscopic level , curvature sensing by amphipathic helices is associated with the density and size of bilayer surface defects [ 38 , 43 ] , which are well described by the Martini model [ 44 ] . a . Simulation parameters We performed molecular dynamics simulations using Gromacs 4 . 6 . 1 [ 45 ] , and the coarse - grained Martini force - ﬁeld with polarizable water model [ 42 , 46 , 47 ] , and a relative dielectric constant of 2 . 5 ( as recommended [ 47 ] ) . We used standard lipid param - eters for 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine ( POPE ) [ 48 ] , 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol ( POPG ) [ 49 ] , and peptides [ 50 ] . The peptide struc - tures for magainin ( PDB ID : 1DUM ) , melittin ( PDB ID : 2MLT ) , and LL - 37 ( PDB ID : 2K6O ) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank , and coarse - grained with the martinize script provided by the MARTINI devel - opers . Constant temperature was maintained with the velocity rescaling thermostat [ 51 ] with a 1 . 0 ps time con - stant , and pressure was controlled with the Berendsen barostat [ 52 ] using a time constant of 12 ps and a com - pressibility of 3 × 10 − 4 bar − 1 . Peptide ( when present ) , lipids and solvent were coupled separately to the temper - ature bath . Coulomb interactions were modelled with the particle mesh Ewald method [ 53 ] setting the real - space cut - oﬀ to 1 . 4 nm and the Fourier grid spacing to 0 . 12 nm . Lennard - Jones interactions were shifted to zero be - tween 0 . 9 and 1 . 2 nm . A time step of 25 fs was used in all simulations . b . System assembly and membrane buckling We as - sembled and equilibrated three rectangular ( L x = 2 L y ) bilayer patches of 1024 lipids each , with 70 % POPE and 30 % POPG , solvated with ∼ 21000 coarse - grained water beads and neutralized with sodium ion beads . POPG is negatively charged , which promotes peptide binding . These patches were equilibrated for 25 ns in an NPT en - semble at 300 K and 1 bar , with pressure coupling applied semi - isotropically . After equilibration , all systems were laterally com - pressed in the x direction by a factor γ = ( L − L x ) / L = 0 . 2 , where L is the linear size of the ﬂat system , and L x the size of the compressed simulation box , in the x di - rection . This was done by scaling all x - coordinates , and the box size L x , by a factor 1 − γ = 0 . 8 at the end of the equilibration run , yielding L x = 20 . 88 , 20 . 81 and 20 . 89 nm for the three patches , respectively . After rescaling , the compressibilities were set to 0 in the x and y direc - tions to keep the system size constant in those directions for subsequent simulations . Pressure coupling was then applied anisotropically in the z direction only . We then performed an energy minimization and a short equilibra - tion run ( 25 ns ) to let the bilayer buckle . Next , we added one peptide to each system , using the three independent patches to create three independent replicas for each peptide . The peptide was initially placed about 3 nm above the membrane surface , but quickly at - tached to the bilayer . After the binding event , we equili - brated the system for another 5 µ s before starting a pro - duction run of 15 µ s , where we collected data every 5 ns . All peptides remained essentially parallel to the mem - brane surface as expected , in agreement with experimen - tal results for low peptide concentrations [ 35 , 40 , 41 , 54 ] . c . Membrane alignment and peptide tracking The buckled membrane proﬁle diﬀuses as a traveling wave the simulation ( movie S1 ) , but curvature sensing by a pep - tide is reﬂected in its distribution relative to the buckled 3 shape . Hence , the buckled conﬁgurations must be aligned in order to extract useful information . To do this , we ﬁt the xz - proﬁle of the membrane by the ground state of the Helfrich model with periodic boundary conditions , which is one of the Euler buckling proﬁles of an elastic beam [ 36 , 37 ] . This shape depends only on the dimensionless buckling parameter γ ( γ = 0 is the ﬂat state ) . Hence , if we compute the shape for some reference system , the general case can be obtained by shifting and scaling . We chose L x = 1 as reference , and write the buckling proﬁle as a parametric curve x = s + ξ ( s , γ ) , z = ζ ( s , γ ) , param - eterized by a normalized arclength coordinate 0 < s < 1 ( the absolute arclength is given by sL = sL x ( 1 − γ ) − 1 ) . For fast evaluation , we expanded ξ ( s , γ ) and ζ ( s , γ ) in truncated Fourier series in s , and created look - up tables for Fourier coeﬃcients vs . γ . We deﬁned s to give the curve z ( x ) a maximum at s = 0 . 5 , minima at s = 0 , 1 , and inﬂection points at s = 0 . 5 ± 0 . 25 , and aligned the buckled shapes by ﬁtting the bilayer in each frame to the buckling proﬁle and aligning the inﬂection points ( Fig . 2 , movies S2 - S3 ) . Speciﬁcally , we ﬁt the rescaled buckling proﬁle to the innermost tail beads of all lipids in each frame using least - squares in the x and z directions , i . e . , minimizing (cid:88) i ( x 0 + L x (cid:0) s + ξ ( s i , γ ) (cid:1) − x i ) 2 + ( z 0 + L x ζ ( s i , γ ) − z i ) 2 ( 1 ) with respect to γ , the translations x 0 , z 0 , and the nor - malized arc - length coordinates s i of each bead ( x i , z i are bead positions ) . The time - averaged bilayer shape , after alignment , agrees well with the theoretical buckled shape ( Fig . 3a ) . The normalized arclength coordinate s of the peptide was computed by projecting the peptide center of mass onto the buckled proﬁle ﬁtted to the membrane midplane . The in - plane orientation θ was then computed by ﬁtting a line through the backbone particles of the α - helical part of the peptide , projecting it onto the tangent plane at s , and computing the in - plane angle to the tangent vector t ( see Fig . 2a ) . The local curvature at s , in the tangent direction of the buckled shape , is given by C ( s ) = 1 − γ L x dψ ds , ( 2 ) where ψ is the bilayer mid - plane tangent angle of Fig . 2a , b [ 55 ] . ( Note that the opposite sign convention is also common [ 1 ] ) . In the theoretical analysis , we neglect small shape and area ﬂuctuations ( std ( γ ) ≈ 0 . 005 ) and use the nominal value γ = 0 . 2 . d . Fitting We used least - squares routines in MAT - LAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) to ﬁt the Boltzmann distributions e − E ( s i , θ i ) / Z of the E C ( Eq . 8 ) and E 2 ( Ta - ble S1 ) models to ( s , θ ) - histograms built from the aggre - gated data with 50 bins for each coordinate . Both data and model histograms were normalized numerically . Er - ror bars in Fig . 4d are boot - strap standard deviations from 1000 bootstrap realizations , using blocks of length 100 ( 500 ns ) as the elementary data unit for resampling [ 56 ] . RESULTS e . Preferred curvature and orientations We simu - lated single peptides interacting with a buckled bilayer , using three independent production runs of 15 µs for each peptide , and tracked their normalized arc - length coor - dinates s ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] and in - plane orientations θ ( Fig . 2a ) . Aggregated ( s , θ ) - histograms are shown in Fig . 3b - d , and convergence is discussed in Sec . S1 . All three peptides prefer the concave high curvature regions with a maximum at s = 0 . 5 , as expected for hy - drophobic insertion mechanisms [ 15 – 17 , 38 , 44 , 58 ] . Re - garding the angle distributions , the three peptides behave diﬀerently . Magainin displays a rather uniform angle dis - tribution , probably because its short α - helical segment creates a fairly symmetric insertion footprint . For melit - tin , the joint between the N - and C - terminal helices ap - pears very ﬂexible , resulting in a broad distribution of the internal angle β ( Fig . 3e ) . Both helices prefer directions nearly parallel to the x - axis , the direction of maximum curvature , but the preference is stronger and slightly oﬀ - set ( θ max ≈ − 15 ◦ , 165 ◦ ) for the C - terminal helix shown in Fig . 3c , while the N - terminal helix is more symmetri - cally oriented ( Fig . S2 ) . LL - 37 maintains a linear structure , and its θ - distribution displays two sharp maxima near θ = 70 ◦ and θ = − 110 ◦ ( Fig . 3d ) . This is remarkable since , by reﬂection symmetry around s = 0 . 5 , the curvatures in those directions are the same as along − 70 ◦ and 110 ◦ , orientations that are clearly not preferred . As we will ar - gue below , this can be understood as curvature sensing along directions diﬀerent from that of the peptide itself . These sensing directions adopt θ = 0 , 90 ◦ , and thus map onto themselves under reﬂection . Notably , none of the peptides orient directly along the ﬂat direction θ = 90 ◦ as commonly assumed in mechanical models [ 15 , 16 ] . f . Orientation - averaged binding free energy Next , we look at the orientation - averaged binding free en - ergy , corresponding to the curvature - dependent enrich - ment measured in many in vitro assays [ 18 – 24 ] . To ex - tract the curvature dependence of the binding energy , we analyse center - of - mass positions along the buckled shape . These should follow a Boltzmann distribution , proportional to e − G ( s ) , where G ( s ) is the orientation - averaged binding free energy in units of k B T . We model this as depending on the local curvature only , and hence set G ( s ) = G ( C ( s ) ) , and extract G ( C ) from curvature histograms , weighted according to the change - of - variable transformation that relates the density of curvatures , ρ ( C ) , to the density of positions ρ ( s ) . Indeed , dropping normalization constants , we have ρ s ( s ) ds ∝ e − G ( C ( s ) ) ds ∝ e − G ( C ) | dC / ds | − 1 dC ∝ ρ C ( C ) dC , ( 3 ) 4 FIG . 2 . Buckled simulation and analysis . ( a ) The position s of a peptide is deﬁned by the projection of the center - of - mass ( blue dot ) onto the midplane surface ( yellow ) . The in - plane orientation θ is deﬁned by projecting the peptide backbone direction ( green arrow , pointing towards the C - terminal end ) onto the local tangent plane ( gray ) at s . The local tangent and normal vectors are indicated by t and n , respectively . ( b ) Side and ( c ) top view of a simulation snapshot with peptide position and orientation indicated using the notation and local coordinate system in ( a ) . The system size is L x = 20 . 88 nm and L y = 13 . 05 nm . The peptide ( LL - 37 in this case ) is shown in green , and lipids in gray ( tails ) , light red ( phosphate groups ) and blue ( innermost tail beads ) . The side view ( b ) also shows the Euler buckling proﬁle ( red line ) ﬁtted to the bilayer mid - plane , and the inﬂection points at s = 0 . 5 ± 0 . 25 ( yellow crosses ) used to align the buckled conﬁgurations . Molecular graphics generated with VMD [ 57 ] . from which it follows that G ( C ) = − ln (cid:0) ρ C ( C ) | dC / ds | (cid:1) + const . ( 4 ) The weights | dC / ds | can be understood as compensating for the fact that not all curvatures have equal arclength footprints along the buckled proﬁle . To estimate G ( C ) , we estimated ρ ( C ) using a simple histogram , and the weights as the mean of | dC / ds | for all contributions to each bin . Fig . 3f shows the binding free energy proﬁles G ( C ) for the diﬀerent peptides , which are more similar than the ( θ , s ) - distributions , and well ﬁt by quadratic curves . Note that Eq . ( 4 ) does not yield absolute binding energies of the peptides , and the G ( C ) curves are instead oﬀset vertically for easy visualization . Experimental binding free energies of these peptides to ﬂat membranes with anionic lipids range from - 15 to - 10 k B T [ 59 ] . g . Quantitative models We now turn to quantitative models of the peptides’ curvature sensing . As described in the introduction , we model the binding energy of a peptide as a function of the local curvature tensor in a frame rotating with the peptide , and treat the bilayer it - self as having ﬁxed shape and thus a ﬁxed deformation energy which we neglect . Generally , if the principal cur - vatures and directions are c 1 , 2 and (cid:126)e 1 , 2 , the curvature tensor , or second fundamental form , in a frame rotated by an in - plane angle θ relative to (cid:126)e 1 , is given by C ij = (cid:20) H + D cos 2 θ D sin 2 θ D sin 2 θ H − D cos 2 θ (cid:21) = (cid:20) C (cid:107) C X C X C ⊥ (cid:21) , ( 5 ) where H = ( c 1 + c 2 ) / 2 and D = ( c 1 − c 2 ) / 2 are the mean and deviatoric curvatures , and the Gaussian curvature is given by K = c 1 c 2 = C (cid:107) C ⊥ − C 2 X . Note the symme - try under rotations by 180 ◦ , since the curvature of a line is the same in both directions . For the buckled surface , c 1 = C ( s ) , c 2 = 0 ( and hence K = 0 , H = D = C ( s ) / 2 ) , (cid:126)e 1 = t , (cid:126)e 2 = y . As shown in Fig . 2 , we deﬁne the ro - tating frame using the peptide’s center of mass and the direction of the α - helical parts , and thus θ is the peptide in - plane orientation , and (cid:107) , ⊥ denote the longitudinal ( θ ) and transverse ( θ + 90 ◦ ) directions . The simplest models are linear in C ij , but can be ruled out since they cannot reproduce the convex binding free energies in Fig . 3f . To see this , we write a general linear model in the form E 1 = aH + bD cos ( 2 ( θ − α ) ) [ 5 ] , and integrate out the angular dependence to get G 1 = − ln (cid:90) 2 π 0 e − E 1 dθ = aH − ln I 0 ( bD ) + const . ( 6 ) Since H = D = C ( s ) / 2 on the buckled surface , and the modiﬁed Bessel function I 0 is convex , G 1 will be either downward convex ( if b (cid:54) = 0 ) or linear and direction insen - sitive ( when b → 0 ) , in disagreement with Fig . 3 . Moving on to quadratic terms , Akabori and Santangelo [ 10 ] explored a model of the form E X = k (cid:107) 2 ( C (cid:107) − C (cid:107) 0 ) 2 + k X ( C X − C X 0 ) 2 + k ⊥ 2 ( C ⊥ − C ⊥ 0 ) 2 , ( 7 ) where C (cid:107) 0 , C X 0 and C ⊥ 0 are preferred curvatures . Fur - ther simpliﬁcations k X = 0 and k X = k ⊥ = 0 have also been studied [ 6 – 9 ] . While these models can all display non - trivial behavior , E X is not the most general quadratic model , which would include all 9 linear and quadratic combinations of the three independent curvature tensor components . In particular , E X does not contain a sim - ple preferred mean curvature as a special case , because H = ( C (cid:107) + C ⊥ ) / 2 , and hence ( H − H 0 ) 2 contains a term C (cid:107) C ⊥ which is absent in Eq . ( 7 ) . However , the general quadratic model is not identiﬁ - able on surfaces with only one non - zero principal cur - vature . This is because the Gaussian curvature K is 5 ( a ) LL - 37 ( b ) ( c ) MAG MEL C θ [ o ] ( d ) C [ nm - 1 ] - 0 . 2 - 0 . 1 0 G ( C ) / k B T 0 1 2 3 4 5 MAG MELLL - 37 x z s = 0 s = 0 . 5 s = 1 ( e ) ( f ) β [ o ] f r eq .

( 4 ) ) for the three peptides . Error bars show max and min values from three independent simulations . Dashed lines are guides to the eye ( ﬁts to quadratic curves ) , and solid lines are results for the E C model ( Eq . ( 8 ) ) using the ﬁt parameters in Fig . 4 . zero , and hence the model can only be speciﬁed up to a term proportional to K . Also , E X can then be made to behave as a mean curvature sensor , since all angu - lar dependence cancels if k (cid:107) = k ⊥ = k X , C (cid:107) 0 = C ⊥ 0 , and C X 0 = 0 . These limitations apply to our buckled surface , as well as to tubular and plane - wave geometries used experimentally [ 18 , 19 , 22 – 24 ] . A curvature sensing mechanism therefore cannot be completely characterized using such surfaces , but some conclusions can be drawn . In particular , setting k X = 0 in Eq . ( 7 ) yields an in - tuitive model with curvature sensing only along the lon - gitudinal and transverse directions [ 6 – 9 ] . From Eq . ( 5 ) , this means angular dependence only in the form cos 2 θ , which is symmetric around θ = 0 , ± π 2 , and ± π . However , the orientational distributions in Fig . 4a do not display this symmetry , although the statistics is not quite clear in the case of melittin ( see Fig . S2 ) . Apparently , the cur - vature sensing directions are not generally aligned with the actual helices . This resembles results for α - synuclein , where peptides and induced membrane deformations ap - pear similarly misaligned [ 60 ] . A simple quadratic model incorporating these observations is E C = κ 2 ( 2 H − C 0 ) 2 + bD cos (cid:0) 2 ( θ − α ) (cid:1) + κ G K , ( 8 ) where the Gaussian curvature coeﬃcient κ G is unidenti - ﬁable since K = 0 in our data . As shown in Fig . 4 , E C describes all peptides reasonably well , and using the full quadratic model does not signiﬁcantly improve the ﬁt . To better understand the physical meaning of this model , we explore some alternative formulations . First , using Eq . ( 5 ) to trade H , D for the C ij , and rearranging the terms , we ﬁnd an equivalent formulation that resem - bles the E X model , E (cid:48) C = κ 2 (cid:0) C (cid:107) − C 0 + b 2 κ cos 2 α (cid:1) 2 + κ (cid:0) C X + b 2 κ sin 2 α (cid:1) 2 + κ 2 (cid:0) C ⊥ − C 0 − b 2 κ cos 2 α (cid:1) 2 + ( κ + κ G ) K . ( 9 ) Continuing , we can rotate the basis attached to the pep - tide by α , and thus generate a transformed curvature tensor with elements C ( α ) ij ( θ ) = C ij ( θ + α ) satisfying C ( α ) (cid:107) + C ( α ) ⊥ = 2 H , C ( α ) (cid:107) − C ( α ) ⊥ = 2 D cos (cid:0) 2 ( θ − α ) (cid:1) . ( 10 ) In this basis , there is an E X - like equivalent model that lacks ’oﬀ - diagonal’ elements , E (cid:48)(cid:48) C = κ 2 (cid:0) C ( α ) (cid:107) − C 0 + b 2 κ (cid:1) 2 + κ 2 (cid:0) C ( α ) ⊥ − C 0 − b 2 κ (cid:1) 2 + ( κ + κ G ) K , ( 11 ) i . e . , sensing curvature along two orthogonal directions that are rotated by an angle α with respect to the pep - tide backbone . Note that since Gaussian curvature is rotationally invariant , the unidentiﬁable Gaussian curva - ture term only aﬀects the overall aﬃnity to membranes with Gaussian curvature , and not the orientational pref - erences of the peptides . As a consistency check , we integrated out θ from E C . Proceeding as for G 1 in Eq . ( 6 ) and setting H = D = C ( s ) / 2 , K = 0 , we get G C = − ln (cid:90) 2 π 0 dθe − E C = κ 2 ( C − C 0 ) 2 − ln I 0 (cid:0) bC / 2 (cid:1) , ( 12 ) which we compare with G ( C ) in Fig . 3f using the parame - ters of Fig . 4d .

As a result , the N - terminal end shows ( s , θ ) - correlations resembling those seen for the LL - 37 center of mass , indicating that its “sensing site” is located in the C - terminal part . Numerical exper - iments in Sec . S2 agree qualitatively with this geometric argument , and both symmetry and consistency improves when tracking the LL - 37 C - terminal helix instead ( but the ﬁt parameters do not change signiﬁcantly ) . DISCUSSION We describe a simulation approach to study membrane curvature sensing by tracking positions and orientations of single molecules interacting with a buckled lipid bi - layer . This approach is widely applicable , and the utility of angular information is obvious from the observation that the three peptides show distinct orientational dis - tributions , but very similar orientation - averaged binding energy curves ( Fig . 3 ) .

( a ) A freely rotating peptide whose midpoint ( black ) is ﬁxed at s = 0 . ( b ) Resulting correlations s C , N ∝ ± cos θ for the N - and C - terminal ends ( red , blue ) . Our data is well described by modelling the bind - ing energy in terms of local curvatures , yielding more complex models than commonly used to ﬁt orientation - averaged data [ 18 – 21 ] , and also less symmetric than some theoretical suggestions [ 6 – 9 ] . The observed asymmetry also seems diﬃcult to reconcile with continuum elasticity models of hydrophobic insertion in terms of cylindrical membrane inclusions [ 15 , 16 ] . Recently , continuum elas - ticity models were found to underpredict the induced cur - vature of a hydrophobic insertion compared to atomistic simulations [ 17 ] . Our data shows an additional qualita - tive eﬀect of molecular detail , which we believe reﬂect the fact that the mirror symmetry of cylinder - shaped inclu - sions is absent from the peptide structures . Instead , our data can be described in terms of curvature sensing di - rections that are not aligned with the inserted α - helices . Since amphipathic helices are common curvature sens - ing motifs [ 14 ] and mirror symmetry is generally absent also in multimeric proteins [ 61 ] , such asymmetric sensing might be common . These results should motivate eﬀorts to track the po - sition and orientation of membrane proteins experimen - tally , for example using polarization - based optical tech - niques [ 62 ] or electron microscopy [ 63 ] . It would also be valuable to vary mean and Gaussian curvatures inde - pendently in order to probe Gaussian curvature sensing , for example by extending supported bilayer assays with plane - wave surfaces [ 22 ] to shapes with non - zero Gaussian curvature . Another possibility might be to combine as - says with cylindrical geometries ( K = 0 ) , such as plane waves [ 22 ] or membrane tethers [ 18 – 21 , 23 ] with spherical geometries ( K = H 2 ) such as vesicles [ 3 , 58 ] or deposited nanoparticles [ 24 ] . An interesting aspect of the E C model is that it pre - dicts a free energy minimum , i . e . , a preferred curvature , at least when K = 0 ( Eq . 12 ) . The preferred curvature radii C − 1 min of our peptides , listed in Fig . 4c , are well above the monolayer thickness of about 2 . 2 nm ( Fig . 3a ) where the bilayer folds back on itself , but below the lowest ra - dius in our simulations ( about 4 . 5 nm ) , meaning that this prediction is somewhat speculative , since higher order terms might become important at very high curvatures . 7 On a molecular level , curvature sensing by amphipathic peptides is thought to reﬂect an aﬃnity for packing de - fects in the membrane - water interface [ 38 , 44 , 58 ] . It is not clear that this mechanism predicts a preferred curva - ture at all . Testing this seems like an interesting question for future work . Our results also have biophysical implications . At high concentrations , the three peptides are thought to mediate the formation of membrane pores with highly curved inner surfaces [ 29 – 34 ] . The orientational preferences we see in single peptides are consistent with atomistic [ 31 ] and coarse - grained [ 34 ] simulations of multi - peptide pores . In particular , the asymmetric curvature preference of LL - 37 should help select for a single handedness of the resulting tilted pore structure [ 34 ] , which might facilitate pore formation by reducing frustration . This mechanism may represent a general way for membrane proteins to induce a particular orien - tation or handedness in patterns on curved surfaces [ 64 ] . h .

CONVERGENCE AND INDIVIDUAL REPLICAS Simulations of proteins interacting with mixed bilayers can be challenging to converge due to slow lipid diﬀusion and long - lived protein - lipid interactions [ 65 ] . For this reason , we run three independent replicas rather than one long simulation for each peptide , and use them as a simple control of the robustness of our conclusions . Figures S1 - S3 show histograms of center - of - mass positions , orientations , and joint positions - orientations of both the three individual production runs for each peptide , as well as aggregated histograms . In the case of melittin ( Fig . S2 ) , orientations of both the N - and C - terminal helices are shown . While the results for individual trajectories are obviously noisier than the aggregated statistics , it is clear that the same qualitative features are present in all replicas . In particular , two well - separated orientational states of melittin and LL - 37 are clearly visible ( albeit not equally populated ) in all trajectories , strongly indicating that our simulations are long enough to capture the major low - energy states of these systems . However , the sampling is still limited enough to induce signiﬁcant statistical uncertainty in ﬁt parameters , as seen Fig . 4d . FIG . S1 .

LOCATION OF THE CURVATURE SENSING SITE ON LL - 37 LL - 37 shows indications of asymmetry around s = 0 . 5 that is incompatible with the symmetry of the curvature tensor elements ( Fig . 3d ) , and the ﬁtted E C model is also less consistent with the orientation averaged binding energy ( Fig . 3e ) than the other peptides . Here , we explore the hypothesis that these eﬀects are caused by using the center - of - mass of the peptide for deﬁning the position s , which might be inappropriate if the sensitivity is unequally distributed along the peptide . Our rationale for this hypothesis is that a correlation between position and orientation , as indicated in the LL - 37 data in Fig . 3d might come about if the eﬀective curvature sensing site is diﬀerent than the center - of - mass which we tracked to extract that data , as sketched in Fig . 5 . In Fig . S4 , we show the corresponding analysis for LL - 37 assuming a few alternative eﬀective curvature sensing sites , with the center - of - mass in the middle row . The correlation between θ and s around each peak clearly becomes more pronounced and N - terminal - like ( c . f . Fig . 5 ) when the tracking site moves towards the N - terminal end . However , the asymmetry almost disappears when one assumes the eﬀective curvature sensing site to be the center of mass of the C - terminal helix , and appears again with the opposite C - terminal - like trend when tracking the C - terminal end . Of these cases , the center - of - mass of the C - terminal helix is most consistent with the symmetries of curvature tensor elements and thus acts as an eﬀective “sensing site” , which indicates that this part of the peptide is more important for curvature sensing . Fitting the E C model to this data yields κ = 323 ± 127 k B T nm , C − 1 0 = − 4 . 1 ± 0 . 5 nm , b = 8 . 2 ± 0 . 6 k B Tnm , and α = 69 ± 2 ◦ , not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the parameters shown in Fig . 4 . However , all distributions are still slightly asymmetric around s = 0 . 5 , with average s - values ranging from about 0 . 52 to 0 . 51 for the N - and C - terminal ends respectively , corresponding to an average displacement of 0 . 5 nm to 0 . 35 nm from the mid point . A closer examination of the signiﬁcance of this observation would require substantially better statistics , perhaps from using some enhanced sampling method , as well as more systematic studies using a larger range of curvatures . This is outside the scope of this study . 14 FIG . S4 .
