However , the function of cortactin remains obscure . Here we show that cortactin co - localizes with the Arp2 / 3 complex , a de novo actin nucleator , at dynamic particulate structures enriched with actin filaments . Cortactin binds directly to the Arp2 / 3 complex and activates it to promote nucleation of actin filaments . The interaction of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex occurs at an amino - terminal domain that is rich in acidic amino acids . Mutations in a conserved amino - acid sequence of DDW abolish both the interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex and complex activation . The N - terminal domain is not only essential but also sufficient to target cortactin to actin - enriched patches within cells . Interestingly , the ability of cor - tactin to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex depends on an activity for F - actin binding , which is almost 20 - fold higher than that of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Our data indicate a new mechanism for activation of actin polymerization involving an enhanced interaction between the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments . G ene amplification at chromosome 11q13 constitutes an important genetic mechanism for the progression of several cancers , including breast cancer and head and neck carcino - mas 1 . This amplification often results in overexpression of cor - tactin , an F - actin - associated protein 2 , 3 . Although overexpression of cortactin is usually correlated with poor prognosis 4 , presumably because of enhanced metastasis , its biochemical and biological functions remain unclear . Cortactin is known to be a prominent substrate for several non - receptor protein tyrosine kinases , including Src , Fer and Syk 2 , 5 – 7 . Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is a common cel - lular response to growth factors , stress , cell shrinkage , and cell injury mediated by oxygen - reactive radicals 3 , 8 – 10 . In vitro , tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src reduces the F - actin - crosslinking activity of cortactin 11 . Cortactin has a unique structure that fea - tures 6 . 5 tandem repeats of a 37 - amino - acid sequence and a car - boxy - terminal SH3 domain ( Fig . 1a ) . Between the repeat and the SH3 domain lie a proline - rich sequence , an a - helical region and three tyrosine residues that are targeted by Src - related kinases 12 . Cortactin also contains an N - terminal domain , the sequence of which is conserved across species and in HS1 , a cortactin - related protein that is exclusively expressed in the haematopoietic line - age 13 . In cultured fibroblasts , cortactin is mainly distributed within the leading edges of cells , for example in lamellipodia and punc - tate - like structures 2 , 12 . In MDA - MB - 231 cells , an invasive breast cancer cell line , cortactin is associated with the invadopodium , a cortical structure that penetrates into and degrades the extracellu - lar matrix during invasion 14 . In addition to tumour cells , cortactin is also implicated in the phagocytosis of several invasive bacteria , including Shigella flexneri , Chlamydia trachomatis and enteropath - ogenic or enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli 15 – 17 . Upon contact with the host cell , these invasive bacteria induce subcortical actin polymerization , which leads to their uptake by the host . Cortactin is accumulated either at the attachment sites or around the macropinocytic vacuole . However , the exact function of cortactin in the formation of the invasive structure is currently unknown . Over the past few years , considerable effort has been devoted towards the identification of factors involved in the de novo assem - bly of actin - rich structures . Among them , the Arp2 / 3 complex has emerged as a key regulator of actin - filament nucleation that is con - served from yeast to humans 18 . The complex is composed of seven subunits , including two actin - related proteins , Arp2 and Arp3 , and five further subunits . It is concentrated in dynamic actin structures such as the leading edges of motile cells and cellular structures 19 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is able to bind to the pointed ends and to the sides of actin filaments , and these activities are thought to be involved in the formation of the branched structures observed both in vivo at the leading edges of motile cells 20 and in vitro 21 . The puri - fied complex exhibits a low - level actin - nucleation activity that can be enhanced by cellular proteins such as members of the Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome protein ( WASP ) family 22 – 26 or by bacte - rial proteins such as Listeria ActA 19 , 27 . Here we show that cortactin binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex through its N - terminal domain and stimulates its actin - nucleation activity . Association with the Arp2 / 3 complex is also essential and sufficient for cortactin to localize within actin - rich patches . Furthermore , we show that the F - actin - binding activity of cortactin is essential for cortactin to stimulate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Our results imply a new mechanism for the regulation of actin poly - merization nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Results Cortactin interacts directly with the Arp2 / 3 complex . The N ter - minus of cortactin is remarkably conserved from humans to Drosophila as well as in HS1 ( Fig . 1a ) . This sequence contains ten © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 MARCH 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 260 acidic amino acids and a tryptophan residue . Similar sequences are also present in WASP - like proteins and in ActA ( Fig . 1b ) and have been shown to be required for the interaction of these proteins with the Arp2 / 3 complex 19 , 24 , 27 , 28 . To determine whether cortactin physi - cally interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex , we examined the association of glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) - tagged cortactin with purified bovine Arp2 / 3 complex in an in vitro pull - down assay . As shown in Fig . 1c , lane 2 , the Arp2 / 3 complex was pulled down by GST – cor - tactin but not by GST beads ( lane 4 ) , indicating that the Arp2 / 3 com - plex can interact directly with cortactin . To identify the cortactin domain that binds to the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , we generated a series of cortactin mutants and analysed their interactions with the Arp2 / 3 complex in pull - down assays using GST – cortactin beads . As shown in Fig . 1c and summarized in Fig . 2a , the N terminus of murine cortactin ( residues 1 – 39 ) is essential and sufficient to bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex . To test whether the acidic amino - acid residues and the tryptophan located in the N ter - minus are important for cortactin to bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex , we prepared two cortactin variants bearing point mutations — one con - taining a DD20 , 21GA mutation and the other containing W22A . As summarized in Fig . 2a , both mutations abolished the interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . These data indicate that cortactin may bind to the Arp2 / 3 com - plex in a manner similar to that of WASP - related proteins and of ActA . However , the affinity of cortactin for the Arp2 / 3 complex seemed to be weaker than that of WASP proteins . On the basis of the cortactin N - terminal peptide GST – Cort ( 1 – 80 ) , we estimated that the dissociation constant ( K d ) of cortactin for the Arp2 / 3 complex is ~ 1 m M ( Fig . 1d ) . Under the same conditions , we estimated the K d for a GST - tagged peptide encoding a verprolin - cofilin - acidic homology domain ( GST – VCA ) , a constitutively active peptide derived from N - WASP 25 , as 220 nM ( Fig . 1d ) . Cortactin activates the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . We examined the effect of cortactin on the activity of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex in more detail using an in vitro actin - polymerization assay with pyrene - labelled monomeric actin ( G - actin ) . Cortactin alone had no apparent effect on spontaneous actin polymerization , which is con - sistent with our previous findings 11 , whereas the Arp2 / 3 complex alone at 250 nM increased moderately the rate of actin polymeriza - tion ( Fig . 3a ) . However , combination of the Arp2 / 3 complex and cor - tactin significantly reduced the initial lag phase . The half - time to reach a steady state of actin polymerization in the presence of both the Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin was roughly two - to threefold less than that for the Arp2 / 3 complex alone . This activity was found to be about four - to fivefold lower than that of GST – VCA when both were analysed in the presence of 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3c ) . Cortactin also enhanced the rate of actin polymerization . In the pres - ence of 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 1 . 5 m M G - actin , cortactin gen - erated ~ 0 . 95 nM barbed ends at half - maximal polymerization , which is about 2 . 4 - fold more than that generated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 1 11 21 31 41 51 61 71 Human MWKASAGHAVSIAQDDA - GA DDW ETDPDFVNDVSEKEQRWGAKTVQGSGHQEH - INIHKLRENVFQEHQTLKEKELETGP Mouse MWKASAGHAVSITQDDG - GA DDW ETDPDFVNDVSEKEQRWGAKTVQGSGHQEH - INIHKLRENVFQEHQTLKEKELETGP Chicken MWKATAGHSIAVSQDD - - GA DDW ETDPDFVNDVSEKEQRWGAKTVKGSGHQEH - INIHQLRENVFQEHQTIKEKELETGP Drosophila MWKASAGHQIQATSAASAED DDW ETDPDFVNDVSEQEQRWGSKTIDGSGRTAGTIDMDKLREET - EQADLDKKKQLLKDQ HS1 MWKSVVGHDVSVSVET - - QG DDW DTDPDFVNDISEKEQRWGAKTIEGSGRTEH - INIHQLRNKVSEEHDVLRKKEMESGP Arp3 Concentration ( nM ) 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 4 , 000 5 , 000 6 , 000 GST – VCA GST – Cort ( 1 – 80 ) % A r p3 dep l e t i on Cortactin : DDAGADD W ETDPDFVNDVSEKE WASP : DEGEDQAGDEDEDDE W DD N - WASP : DEDEDEDDEEDFEDDDDE W KD Scar1 : DSEDDSEFDEVD W LE ActA : DSEDSSLNTDE W EEEKTEE N Repeat Arp2 / 3 F - actin Src Helix P SH3 a b d c 0 20 40 60 80 100 G S T – C o r t ( D 1 – 38 ) G S T – c o r t a c t i n G S T – C o r t ( D S H 3 ) G S T a l one G S T – C o r t ( 1 – 39 ) G S T – C o r t ( D 1 – 23 ) G S T – C o r t ( DD 20 , 21 G A ) G S T – C o r t ( W 22 A ) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Figure 1 Characterization of the interaction of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex . a , Schematic representation of the structural domains of cortactin .

Purified Arp2 / 3 complex ( 4 nM ) was incubated with the indicated amounts of immobilized GST – Cort ( 1 – 80 ) or GST – VCA for 90 min at 4 (cid:176) C . After incubation , samples were centrifuged at 800g for 10 s . The presence of Arp3 in the supernatants was detected by SDS – PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti - Arp3 antibody . Amounts of Arp3 were quantified by digital scanning and were normalized to percentage depletion . The resulting data were used to fit a rectangu - lar hyperbola , yielding apparent K d values of 1 , 095 nM and 222 nM for GST – Cort ( 1 – 80 ) and GST – VCA , respectively . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles 261 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 MARCH 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com alone . The activity of cortactin for actin polymerization was also dependent upon the concentration of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The actin polymerization stimulated by cortactin came to a saturated level within ~ 250 s in the presence of 250 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , whereas it required 450 s to plateau in the presence of 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3a ) . At 10 nM , the intrinsic activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex was barely detected ( Fig . 3d ) . Under these conditions , cortactin showed no significant stimulation of actin polymerization within 10 min . However , in the presence of small amounts of GST – VCA , cortactin was able to increase actin polymerization by < 30 % . In the presence of high concentrations of GST – VCA ( such as 400 nM ) the activity of GST – VCA became dominant , and no significant stimulation or inhibition by cortactin was observed . These results indicate that cor - tactin may potentiate GST – VCA - mediated actin nucleation only in a narrow range of concentrations . Cortactin also activated the Arp2 / 3 complex in a dose - dependent manner with a maximal activity at ~ 50 nM in the presence of 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figs 3b and 4c ) . The activity of cortactin for actin assembly requires its ability to bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex , as either deletion or point mutation of the sequences for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex abolished the activity to activate it ( Fig . 4a ) . To ensure that the failure of these mutants to stimulate actin polymerization was not due to a gross structural alteration , such as unfolding , that may be introduced by mutations , we analysed Cort ( D 1 – 23 ) , Cort ( W22A ) and Cort ( DD20 , 21GA ) by gel filtration . All mutants exhibited a Stokes’ radius of ~ 5 . 8 nm , which is the same as that of wild - type cortactin ( Fig . 4d ) . Because such a size is equivalent to a globular protein with a relative molecular mass of > 300 , 000 ( M r 300K ; ref . 29 ) , which is significantly larger than the mass predicted for a cortactin monomer ( 61K ) , cortactin may either exit as an oligomer or have an unusual structural conformation . As a result , these data indicate that these mutants may maintain the same structural folding as wild - type cortactin . Binding to F - actin , but not G - actin , is required for the ability of cortactin to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex itself seems to be insufficient for cortactin to stimulate actin polymerization . Both GST – Cort ( 1 – 39 ) and GST – Cort ( 1 – 80 ) , both of which bind to the Arp2 / 3 complex as efficiently as does full - length cortactin , were unable to stimulate actin polymerization ( Fig . 4b ) . The truncated mutant Cort ( 1 – 375 ) , which spans a region that includes the motifs for binding to both Arp2 / 3 and F - actin ( the tandem repeats ) , showed a similar actin - polymerization activity to wild - type cortactin ( Fig . 4b ) , indicating that binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin is sufficient for its stimulation of actin poly - merization . Consistent with this view is the observation that the cortactin mutant Cort3RP , which contains only the final three repeats but still maintains a large Stokes’ radius ( 5 . 7 nm ; Fig . 4d ) , had a significantly lesser affinity for F - actin , with an estimated K d of 9 . 1 m M ( Fig . 4c , inset ) . In keeping with its reduced F - actin bind - ing , the activity of this mutant was also much less than that of wild - type cortactin . The ability of the mutant to activate actin nucle - ation , as calculated by measuring half - maximal stimulation , was ~ 28 % of that of wild - type cortactin ( Fig . 4c ) . To activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , the VCA domain of WASP pro - teins must bind simultaneously to the Arp2 / 3 complex and to G - actin 25 , 30 . We therefore used pull - down assays to determine whether or not cortactin also binds to G - actin . As shown in Fig . 2b , neither full - length nor N - terminal derivatives of cortactin fused to GST showed any detectable G - actin - binding activity . This was the case even after prolonged exposure ( data not shown ) . Under the same conditions , the association of G - actin with GST – VCA was readily detected ( Fig . 2b ) . We also compared the affinities of cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex for F - actin . As shown in Fig . 4c ( inset ) , the K d of cortactin for F - actin is ~ 230 nM , which is almost 20 - fold lower than that of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 4 . 5 m M ) as measured under the same condi - tions . Because F - actin is known to be an important activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex 23 , these data indicate that cortactin may activate the Arp2 / 3 complex by promoting its association with F - actin . Interaction of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for their co - localization in vivo . The above results indicate that cor - tactin can interact with the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro to promote actin assembly . To determine whether cortactin may function together with the Arp2 / 3 complex within the cell , we examined their subcellular localizations in human MDA - MB - 231 breast can - cer cells and in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts using antibodies against cor - tactin and against Arp3 , a component of the Arp2 / 3 complex 31 . MDA - MB - 231 cells contain few stress fibres , as shown by phal - loidin staining , and instead deposit most F - actin into giant partic - ulate structures that are associated with membrane ( Fig . 5b ) . Within these particulate structures , endogenous cortactin or wild - type cortactin tagged with Myc epitope at its C terminus ( WT - cor - tactin – Myc ) accumulated ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Arp3 was also enriched in these F - actin patches . Using image analysis , we estimated that ~ 80 % of cortactin immunostaining was co - localized with that of Arp3 ( Fig . 6c ) . In proliferating NIH 3T3 cells , Arp3 and cortactin co - localized in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles , as well as in * * * G - actin ( ng ) Actin Actin polymerization ( % ) Arp2 / 3 binding WT 100 + Cort ( D 1 – 68 ) _ ND Cort ( D 1 – 23 ) _ _ Cort ( 1 – 375 ) 115 + Cort ( D 1 – 38 ) _ _ Cort ( DD20 , 21GA ) _ _ Cort3RP 28 + Cort ( 1 – 39 ) _ + Cort ( 1 – 69 ) _ + Cort ( 1 – 80 ) _ + Cort ( W22A ) _ _ 2 , 000 500 150 50 0 G S T – V C A G S T – C o r t ( 1 – 39 ) G S T – C o r t ( 1 – 69 ) G S T – C o r t ( 1 – 80 ) G S T – c o r t a c t i n ( w il d t y pe ) N Repeat P Helix SH3 a b Figure 2 Correlation between binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin - mediated stimulation of actin polymerization . a , Mapping of the structural motifs of cortactin for the binding to and activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Arp2 / 3 - binding activities were determined on the basis of GST - tagged proteins ( see Fig . 1c ) . Data for actin - polymerization activities were obtained on the basis of the results shown in Fig . 4 . For analysis of actin polymerization , GST - tagged peptides ( Cort ( 1 – 39 ) , Cort ( 1 – 69 ) , Cort ( 1 – 80 ) and Cort ( 1 – 375 ) ) or GST - free peptides ( other mutants ) were used . The positions of the point mutations in Cort ( DD20 , 21GA ) and Cort ( W22A ) are indicated by an asterisk . The activity of each protein was calculated by comparing the time taken to yield a half - maximal actin polymerization with that for the Arp2 / 3 complex alone . This activity was further normalized by comparison with that of wild - type cortactin . Relative activities of < 10 % of the value for wild - type cortactin were considered insignificant are indicated by a minus sign . ND , not deter - mined . b , Cortactin does not bind to G - actin . G - actin ( 1 . 4 m M ) was incubated with 2 m M GST - tagged cortactin derivatives or VCA immobilized on glutathione beads at 4 (cid:176) C for 1 h in 200 m l binding buffer ( 5 mM Tris – HCl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 50 mM KCl ) . G - actin bound to beads was detected by immunoblotting using an anti - actin monoclonal antibody . As a quantitative control , different amounts of G - actin were loaded onto the same gel . © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 MARCH 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 262 small punctate structures ( Fig . 5a ) . Thus , the Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin seem to be associated with the same type of F - actin structures . In contrast with WT - cortactin – Myc , a cortactin mutant with deletion of amino acids 1 – 68 ( Cort ( D 1 – 68 ) – Myc ) was either diffusely distributed within the cytoplasm or was localized to peripheral ruffles ( Figs 5b and 6b ) . To determine whether binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex is sufficient for the association of cortactin with particulate structures , we analysed MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing Cort ( 1 – 80 ) – Myc . As shown in Fig . 5c , this mutant accumulated within Arp3 - containing patches as efficiently as did wild - type cortactin . Quantification of the co - localization of Arp3 with wild - type and mutant cortactin proteins is shown in Fig . 6c . Whereas WT - cortactin – Myc and Cort ( 1 – 80 ) – Myc co - localized with Arp3 in the particular structures , binding of Cort ( D 1 – 68 ) – Myc to these structures was significantly reduced . Thus , interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex is not only required but is also sufficient for the specific distribution of cortactin at partic - ular structures within cells . However , Cort ( 1 – 80 ) – Myc appeared to be diffused within the cytoplasm of cells in which it was over - expressed ( Fig . 5c ) , indicating that association with cortactin mutants that are deficient in Arp2 / 3 binding could also alter the function of the endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex . Discussion Activation of the nucleation of actin assembly is an important mechanism by which extracellular signals regulate the reorganiza - tion of the actin cytoskeleton 32 . Recent studies have shown that actin polymerization in the cell cortex is mainly nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex 18 . However , the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex itself to nucleate actin assembly is inefficient and requires other cellular activators . In mammalian cells , all activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex identified so far belong to the WASP family . The ability of the VCA domain of WASP - family proteins to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex requires a G - actin - binding domain ( WH2 ) as well as a cofilin - homology domain and an acidic domain at the C termini of these proteins . Here we have shown that a non - WASP - related protein , cortactin , can also promote the actin - nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex by two - to threefold . Although this activity seems to be at a lower level than that of the VCA domain of N - WASP , cortactin activates the Arp2 / 3 complex in a manner that is distinct from that of WASP proteins and may thus constitute a unique mechanism of actin organization mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex within cells .

However , the repeat domain is distinct from the WH2 domain of the WASP family . The former shows an ability to bind to F - actin 33 , whereas the latter has a strong affinity for monomeric actin 25 , 28 , 30 , 34 , 35 . Thus , it is unlikely that cortactin would be able to shuttle G - actin to the Arp2 / 3 complex , as proposed for WASP - family proteins 25 , 30 . Conversely , binding to F - actin is essential for cortactin to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Deletion or partial dele - tion of the repeat domain can abolish or significantly reduce actin polymerization . On the other hand , Cort ( 1 – 375 ) , which contains the Arp2 / 3 - and F - actin - binding domains only , is able to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex as efficiently as WT - cortactin . Because the affinity of cortactin for F - actin is much higher ( ~ 20 - fold ) than that for the Arp2 / 3 complex and the affinity of the Arp2 / 3 complex for F - actin is lower than that for cortactin , the presence of cortactin would proba - bly promote the association of the Arp2 / 3 complex with F - actin . Interaction of the Arp2 / 3 complex with F - actin has been proposed to be important for the nucleation of dendritic actin filaments 22 , 36 . Indeed , preformed actin filaments can reduce the lag required for WASP - mediated activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex 23 , 37 Thus , we pos - tulate that cortactin promotes actin polymerization by enhancing F - actin - mediated activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . At a low concentration of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 10 nM ) , the activ - ity of cortactin was not apparent unless small amounts of GST – VCA were present ( Fig . 3d ) . However , cortactin itself was unable to stim - ulate GST – VCA - mediated actin polymerization by more than 30 % in the presence of either 10 nM ( Fig . 3d ) or higher concentrations ( data not shown ) of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Because cortactin binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex through an acidic motif , which is similar to those used by GST – VCA , it is likely that cortactin binds to the same site of the Arp2 / 3 complex as GST – VCA . Thus , the slight increase in the rate of actin polymerization in the presence of both cortactin and GST – VCA is more likely to be due to an additive , rather than a syn - ergistic , effect .

For example , an activated WASP - like protein could take over cortactin to interact with F - actin - associat - ed Arp2 / 3 complex and to warrant rapid formation of branched actin filaments in response to extracellular stimuli . Future studies will be focused on the determination of the specific functions of these two types of molecule in the regulation of actin polymeriza - tion within cells . In contrast to the activation of GST – VCA , we propose that the activity of cortactin is more intimately dependent upon an intrinsic activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , which is influenced primarily by its concentration . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that other cellular factors that might be co - purified in the preparation of the Arp2 / 3 complex can also contribute to its apparent intrinsic activity . This unique feature may explain the recently reported failure to detect the activity of cortactin in the presence of very low concentrations of the Arp2 / 3 complex 38 . However , the concentrations of cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in the cell are in the micromolar range ( ~ 2 . 0 m M for cortactin and ~ 2 . 9 m M for the Arp2 / 3 complex in MDA - MB - 231 cells , data not shown ) . Thus , it is likely that nucleation of actin poly - merization mediated by cortactin and the Arp2 / 3 complex is physio - logically relevant . Maximal activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by cortactin occurs at a concentration that is far below its K d value for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 50 nM compared with 1 m M ) . The exact reason for this apparent dis - crepancy is not clear . The possibility that the Arp2 / 3 complex may be partially denatured in preparation seems unlikely because the same preparation was able to respond effectively to GST – VCA ( Fig . 3 ) . The discrepancy may be also partially explained by limitation of the sites at which cortactin can bind to F - actin . It is known that cortactin binds to F - actin subunits with a ratio of roughly 1 : 15 , as shown using pre - formed F - actin 11 , 33 . These sites could be further restricted by the pos - sibility that only certain binding sites , such as those near to the ends of actin filaments , are able to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex 37 . Another possibility is that cortactin may not always associate stably with the Arp2 / 3 complex , given the fact that the affinity is weak ( K d 1 m M ) . Because the Arp2 / 3 complex itself is also able to bind to F - actin , albeit weakly , the transient interaction of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex would be sufficient to make the Arp2 / 3 complex competent to initiate new actin polymerization from an existing filament . In the cell , cortactin is dominantly localized within F - actin - rich peripheral areas and punctate structures 12 , 33 . We found that in MDA - MB - 231 cells plated on fibronectin - coated dishes , cortactin co - localizes with F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in giant particu - late structures . The association of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 com - plex seems to be profound because the majority ( ~ 80 % ) of sites of cortactin immunostaining co - localized with those of the Arp3 com - plex ( Figs 5a and 6c ) . Thus , cortactin is likely to have a general func - tion in the regulation of actin polymerization nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . The co - localization of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex is apparently the result of a direct association of these two complexes , as it requires the Arp2 / 3 - binding domain of cortactin ( Fig . 5b ) . Interestingly , Cort ( D 1 – 68 ) – Myc , which lacks the Arp2 / 3 - binding motif , seems to be capable of localizing to peripheral regions ( Fig . 6b ) independently of association with the Arp2 / 3 com - plex . Thus , activation of these two separate actin - rich compart - ments may be different . In contrast , Cort ( 1 – 80 ) – Myc , which con - tains the Arp2 / 3 - binding domain only , is able to associate with the Arp2 / 3 complex within the particulate structures of MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figs 5c and 6b ) . The fact that Cort ( 1 – 80 ) is unable to associ - ate with F - actin indicates that the interaction of the Arp2 / 3 complex with F - actin may not be entirely dependent on cortactin within the particular structure . However , the localization of this mutant in actin patches seems only to occur in cells in which the level of the mutant is low . In cells in which the mutant is overexpressed , it was distributed with the Arp2 / 3 complex throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 5c ) , indicating that the overexpressed mutant is able to alter the function of the endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex as well as its asso - ciation with particulate structures . The nature of the particulate structures is unknown . When MDA - MB - 231 cells are plated on extracellular matrix , cortactin is accumu - lated within the invadopodium , a cortical protrusion on the ventral side of cells that is implicated in degradation of and penetration into the extracellular matrix 14 . Further studies will be required to deter - mine whether the interaction of cortactin with the Arp2 / 3 complex is necessary for formation of invadopodia and for tumour invasion . Actin and cortactin - rich particulate structures are also abundant in other types of cell , such as osteoclasts 39 . In osteoclasts , these structures are called podosomes and are used to seal off regions of bone where bone resorption occurs 40 . Thus , actin polymerization mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin may have a general function in the for - mation of dynamic , protrusive structures through which cells interact with the extracellular matrix or with surrounding cells in which extensive proteolysis takes place .

Polyclonal antibody against Arp3 was prepared using the human - Arp3 - derived peptide YEEIGP - SIVRHNPVFGVMS and was affinity - purified as described 25 . Monoclonal anti - cortactin antibody ( 4F11 ) was from Upstate Biotechnology . Preparation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex was purified using a modified procedure as described 25 . Briefly , 100g of frozen bovine brain was minced with a Waring blender in buffer Q ( 100ml of 20mM Tris pH8 . 0 , 100mM NaCl , 5mM MgCl 2 , 5mM EGTA and 1mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ) supplemented with 50 m gml – 1 phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride , 5 m gml – 1 leupeptin and 1 m gml – 1 aprotinin . The minced tissue was fur - ther homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and was clarified by centrifugation at 5 , 000 g for 60min at 4 (cid:176) C . The supernatant was subjected to chromatography in a 100 - ml Sepharose Q column equilibrated with buffer Q . The flow - through containing the Arp2 / 3 complex was collected , supplemented with 0 . 1 mM ATP and fractionated on a GST – VCA glutathione – sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B ( 50 mM Tris pH7 . 5 , 25mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5mM EDTA , 1 mMDTT and 0 . 1mM ATP ) . After washing with 0 . 2M KCl in buffer B , the Arp2 / 3 complex was eluted with buffer B containing 0 . 2M MgCl 2 . The protein was then dialysed against buffer B and concentrated using a Centriprep 10 cartridge . The concen - trated Arp2 / 3 complex was stored in buffer B containing 30 % glycerol at – 80 (cid:176) C . Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method ( Bio - Rad protein assay ) , using BSA as a standard . Concentrations in mgml – 1 were converted to molar concentrations on the basis of the equivalence of 1 mgml – 1 to 14 m M cortactin , 23 m M actin and 4 . 6 m M Arp2 / 3 complex . Analysis of interaction of the Arp2 / 3 complex and cortactin variants . GST or GST - tagged cortactin variants ( 5 m g ) , immobilized on glutathione beads , were mixed with 10pmol of purified Arp2 / 3 complex in buffer A ( 100 m l of 50mM Tris pH8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl and 1 % Triton X 100 ) , and incubated for 2h at 4 (cid:176) C on a rotating wheel . Beads were rinsed three times with buffer A and were then boiled in 2 · SDS sample buffer . The Arp2 / 3 complex was detected by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti - Arp3 antibody after resolution by SDS – PAGE . Construction of cortactin mutants . All numbers used here are based on the amino - acid sequence of murine cortactin 3 . The deletion cor - tactin mutants Cort ( D 1 – 23 ) , Cort ( D 1 – 38 ) , Cort ( D 1 – 68 ) , Cort ( 1 – 39 ) , Cort ( 1 – 69 ) and Cort ( 1 – 80 ) were generated by mutagenesis and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ; PfuTurbo polymerase , Stratagene ) , using the murine cortactin complementary DNA ( pXZ112 ) as a template 3 . The point mutants Cort ( W22A ) and Cort ( DD20 , 21GA ) were generated by site - directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) . All constructs , except for the three - repeat deletion mutant ( pCort3RP ) , were first generated as Eco RI – Sal I fragments and then subcloned into the pUC19 plasmid . The resulting plasmids served as the master plasmids from which the inserts were excised and further cloned either into pGEX4T - 2 ( Amersham Pharmacia ) , for expression of bacterial GST - fusion proteins , or into pCMV - Tag5B ( Stratagene ) , for mammalian expression of C - terminal Myc - tagged proteins . Inserts in the master plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing . To construct pCort3RP , the DNA sequence encoding the first three repeats was deleted by PCR using the ExSite kit ( Stratagene ) and was further cloned into pGEX - 2T . The primers used were 5 ¢ - TCCAAAGGTTTTGGTGGC and 5 ¢ - AGCCTTGGGTTCCGTTTC . The plas - mid encoding histidine ( His ) - tagged cortactin was prepared as follows : a murine cortactin cDNA was constructed into the Bam HI – Sal I sites of pTrcHis2 A vector ( Invitrogen ) with the aid of PCR using primers 5 ¢ - CGGGGATCCGTGGAAAGCCTCTGCAGGCCATC and 5 ¢ - CCGGTCGACCTGCGCAGCTC - CACATAGTTGG . The resulting plasmid was transformed into XL - 1 Blue E . coli strain ( Stratagene ) . Purification of cortactin derivatives . Detailed methods for purifying GST – cortactin derivatives and GST - free proteins have been described 41 . To prepare His – cortactin proteins , bacteria were grown at 37 (cid:176) C in a shaker ( 051 – 473 , Reuce , Ashedille , North Carolina ) at 240r . p . m . When the density of the culture reached log phase , with an absorbance at 600nm of 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 , 1mM isopropylthio - b - D - galactoside ( IPTG ) was added . Bacteria were then shifted to a shaker at 30 (cid:176) C , incubated for a further 3h and collected by centrifugation at 3 , 000 g for 20min . The bacterial pellet was stored at – 80 (cid:176) C . To purify His – cortactin , the bacterial pellet was thawed at room temperature , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH8 . 0 , 300mM NaCl and 10mM imida - zole ) , and sonicated with an ultrasonic processor ( Heat Systems - Ultrasonics , Inc . ) at power setting at 3 with 20 pulses per cycle up to a total of 10 cycles . The lysate was added with Triton X - 100 to a final con - centration of 2 % , and the mixture was left on ice for 10min . Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15 , 000 g for 20min at 4 (cid:176) C . The supernatant was mixed with nickel – nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni – NTA ) metal affinity beads ( Qiagen ) and incubated at 4 (cid:176) C for 1h in a rotator tube ( Scientific Equipment Products , Baltimore , Maryland ) . Beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer , and His – cortactin was eluted in 50mM NaH 2 PO 4 pH8 . 0 , 300mM NaCl , 20mM imidazole and 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 . Eluted fractions were combined , loaded to a Mono - Q column on a Waters 600 pump in elution buffer ( 50mM Tris pH7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT and 1mM EGTA ) and eluted with elution buffer against a 0 – 1M KCl gradient at 1mlmin – 1 . The concentration of the principal peak was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as a stan - dard . All purified proteins were stored at – 80 (cid:176) C . Measurement of the affinity of cortactin for the Arp2 / 3 complex . Purified Arp2 / 3 complex ( 4nM ) was incubated with various amounts of immobilized GST – Cort ( 1 – 80 ) for 90min at 4 (cid:176) C in binding buffer ( 5mM Tris pH7 . 5 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5mM DTT , 3 mM NaN 3 , 50mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 2mgml – 1 BSA and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) . After incuba - tion , samples were centrifuged at 800 g in a microcentrifuge for 10s ; supernatants were then fractionated by SDS – PAGE using 12 % ( v / v ) SDS and immunoblotted using polyclonal anti - Arp3 antibody . The den - sities of Arp3 bands shown by the blot , which represented unbound Arp3 , were scanned and quanti - fied with NIH image software ( version 1 . 62 ) . The amounts of Arp3 depletion by different concentra - tions of cortactin was used to fit a single rectangular hyperbola using Sigma plot version 5 . 0 , and K d values were calculated on the basis of V = V max C / ( K d + C ) , where V is the depletion of Arp3 proteins in the supernatant and C is the concentration of samples to be tested . The same procedure was also used to measure the affinity for GST – VCA .

Rabbit skeletal - muscle monomeric actin labelled with pyrene with 10 % efficiency and non - labelled monomeric actin were from Cytoskeleton Inc . Labelled actin was mixed with non - labelled G - actin at ratio of 1 : 10 in G - actin buffer ( 5mM Tris – HCl pH8 . 0 , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5mM DTT and 0 . 2mM ATP ) and centrifuged at 200 , 000 g for 2h . To analyse actin polymerization , the Arp2 / 3 complex , cor - tactin or other testing protein was added to 200 m l of 1 . 5 · polymerization buffer ( 7 . 5mM Tris buffer pH7 . 5 , 1 . 5mM EGTA , 0 . 15mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 75mM DTT , 4 . 5mM NaN 3 , 75mM KCl , 3mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 3mM ATP ) . Polymerization was initiated by adding 100 m l of stock G - actin solution at 8 . 4 m M . The final concentration of G - actin in the polymerization reaction was 2 . 8 m M . In some experiments , 1 . 5 m M G - actin was used . Actin polymerization was monitored by measuring the increase in pyrene fluo - rescence using an LS50B fluorometer ( Perkin Elmer , Norwalk , Connecticut ) with filters for excitation at 365nm and emission at 407nm ( 15 - nm and 10 - nm bandwidth , respectively ) . The concentration of barbed ends was derived from measurement of the rate of elongation using R = K + ( A ) ( ends ) , where R is the rate of elongation , K + is the association rate constant ( 10 m M – 1 s – 1 ) , A is the concentration of actin monomer , and ends is the concentration of growing filament ends 23 . Gel - filtration analysis . Purified GST - free cortactin proteins were dissolved in elution buffer ( 50mM Tris – HCl pH . 7 . 4 , 134mM KCl and 1mM MgCl 2 ) at 0 . 5mgml – 1 . Fifty microlitres of each sample solution was applied to a Superose 12 ( Pharmacia ) column on a Waters 600 pump . Samples were eluted in elution buffer at 0 . 5mlmin – 1 . Eluted proteins were monitored using a Waters 2487 Dural absorbance detector . The standards used to calibrate the column were BSA , catalase and ferritin , with Stokes’ radii of 35nm , 52 . 5nm and 61nm , respectively . The sizes of eluted samples were predicated on the basis of a chart in which the Stoke’s radii of the standards were plotted against the elution volume . G - actin - binding assay . Monomeric G - actin powder was from Cytoskeleton Inc . G - actin powder was dissolved at a final con - centration of 230 m M in G - actin buffer . Before immediate analysis , G - actin was diluted to 1 . 4 m M in G - actin buffer and then centrifuged at 200 , 000 g for 3h at 4 (cid:176) C to remove any F - actin . Supernatants were then supplemented with 2mM MgCl 2 and 50mM KCl . The reconstituted G - actin solution ( 200 m l ) was then added to 5 m l glutathione beads bound to individual GST – cortactin derivatives ; the final concen - tration of GST – cortactin proteins in the reactions was 2 m M . Mixtures of G - actin and cortactin proteins were incubated at 4 (cid:176) C in a rotator . After 1h , glutathione beads were precipitated , and the insoluble pel - lets were analysed further by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti - actin antibody 5C5 ( Sigma ) . F - actin - binding assay . Cortactin or the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 80nM ) was mixed with F - actin at concentrations of 0 . 3 – 12 . 0 m M in 1 · polymerization buffer at room temperature for 30min . The reaction was centrifuged at 200 , 000 g for 30min , and the presence of cortactin and Arp3 in the supernatant was detected by immunoblot - ting using antibodies against cortactin and Arp3 . Fluorescence microscopy . MDA - MB - 231 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding cortactin – Myc proteins with a Superfect transfection kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cells were plated on a glass cover slip precoated with fibronectin at 1 m gml – 1 . After 24h cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS for 10min and permeabilized with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 5min . Treated cells were incubated for 1h with a monoclonal anti - mMyc antibody ( 9E10 ) at 2 m gml – 1 in PBS containing 5 % BSA , and then with rhodamine - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody at 14 m gml – 1 in the same buffer for 30min . For F - actin staining , fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - labelled phalloidin was added at a final concentration of 1 m M . Between each step , three washes with PBS were carried out . To quantify the efficiency of co - localization , images were collected using a · 60 1 . 4NA Olympus PlanApo lens on a Fluoview laser - scanning confocal microscope with 20 % laser intensity , confocal aper - ture set at 3 and using Argon ( 488nm ) and Krypton ( 568nm and 647nm ) lasers . All images were col - lected at the same zoom and photomultiplier settings to allow direct comparison of staining patterns . Green and red images were collected separately with excitation at 488nm and at 568nm , respectively , to avoid channel crosstalk from FITC to rhodamine images ; for presentation , red and green images were merged . Co - localization of Arp3 and cortactin ( endogenous , labelled with monoclonal antibody 4F11 , or exogenous , labelled with anti - Myc 9E10 ) was quantified using Optimas 5 . 2 image - analysis software . Briefly , matching green and red images of individual cells were opened sequentially . Fluorescence thresholds were applied to each image to exclude diffuse labelling in the cytoplasm . Punctate sites of positive staining were identified and each image was converted to binary form . Matching binary images derived from Arp3 and cortactin images were then subjected to an ‘and’ operation , resulting in the iden - tification of sites containing both Arp3 and cortactin staining . These sites were scored as well as the total number of Arp3 - positive sites per cell . Anti - Myc labeling was not detected in non - transfected cells adja - cent to transfected cells . The following equation was used to determine percentage co - localization per cell : % co - localization = ( no . punctate sites containing both Arp3 and cortactin ) · 100 / ( no . punctate sites containing Arp3 ) . Means – s . e . m . were determined and plotted using SigmaPlot software . RECEIVED 16 JUNE 2000 ; REVISED 14 NOVEMBER 2000 ; ACCEPTED 30 NOVEMBER 2000 ; PUBLISHED 9 FEBRUARY 2001 . 1 .
