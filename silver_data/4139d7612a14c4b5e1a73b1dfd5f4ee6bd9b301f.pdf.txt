Lisa Michelle Stevens December 2015 Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences The University of Surrey Surrey , GU2 7XH England , UK Picornavirus Structure Group Livestock viral diseases / Vector - borne viral disease programmes The Pirbright Institute Ash Road Pirbright Surrey , GU24 0NF England , UK Acknowledgements First and foremost , I am indebted to the unmeasurable support and advice that my primary supervisor , Terry Jackson , has given to me throughout the entirety of my PhD . Through the good times and the bad , your gentle nudges in the right direction not only kept me on track but also allowed me to develop and explore , an opportunity I will forever be grateful for . I’d like to also thank my university supervisor , Karin Darpel again for all the incredible support she has shown me and for the many thorough discussions about my work , sticking with me during stressful virus purifications but also for keeping my spirits up in the difficult moments . Thank you for Peter Mertens for reading and correcting my writing and to Toby Tuthill for letting me go to my first conference abroad and for being encouraging during lab meetings . Without a doubt , my PhD could not have been made possible without the generous support of Katy Moffatt . I’m so grateful for your good humour and occasional emotional chats that helped get me through , when things got tough but I’m incredibly grateful for you imparting your knowledge on all things flow cytometry related ! Thank you to Sarah Gold for letting me continue what you started and to Stephen Berryman for your advice and gifting your fillipin in my last week in the lab . There have been so many people at The Pirbright Institute that have made my time here , a time I’ll never forget . I have made many , I hope , life - long friends along my journey , Kyle Chamberlain , Anusha Panjwani , Joe Newman , Caroline Wright , Emma Howes and Lidia Lasecka you made working in the Picornavirus Structure group easy and I’ll never forget all the fun we’ve had outside of the lab . Stacey Human and Jessica Swanson , thank you for everything over the past year , for the knitting nights , Pitch Perfect viewing and sticking by me during the rollercoaster ride of my final year . I would have never made it through without you ! Claudia Rückert , Sabine Weisheit and Daryl Borley , thank you for the many fun times we had while you were at Pirbright , along with Kyle Chamberlain and Jacqui Morris you are people I truly miss now that you’ve flown the village nest . Thank you to Josie Golding and Marc Guimera for hosting dinners and fun chats . Jennifer Simpson , thank you for the knitting enthusiasm , confocal microscopy help and hilarious tea time chats . Thank you to Jacqui Morris for periodically arriving in Pirbright and showing how to make doing a PhD fun ! Thank you to the biodiversity interest group ; Paul Smith , Stuart Riches and Ellen Christmas , who let me , get out of the lab from time to time to enjoy Pirbright’s wildlife . Thank you to Ben Jackson for the many late night chats and to Claire Barber and Kelly Rowlands for helping keeping me sane during writing up . You will all never know how much you mean to me !

Target cells of BTV infection are endothelial and immune cells in the mammalian hosts ( bovine and ovine ) and the midgut and salivary gland cells of the insect host ( Culicoides spp . ) , which is the known vector in the transmission of BTV . Little is known about BTV entry and replication in host derived cells . This thesis investigates the endocytosis mechanisms used by BTV in bovine endothelial ( BFA ) cells and ( KC ) cells derived from Culicoides spp . Using a combination of confocal microscopy and flow cytometry , endocytosis pathways were dissected by using pharmacological inhibitors , siRNA and dominant - negative ( DN ) protein expression which inhibit cellular factors , allowing discrimination between distinct endocytosis pathways . It was found that BTV - 1 entry and trafficking to acidic endosomes was relatively slow , consistent with a non - clathrin uptake pathway in BFA cells . During entry , BTV appeared to induce global rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and disruption of F - actin filaments with Cytochalasin D inhibited BTV - 1 infection by preventing an early step in infection . Furthermore , preliminary evidence suggests that BTV - 1 may induce actin rearrangements and uptake by initiating Rho protein signalling . Infection was inhibited by EIPA and IPA - 3 which target sodium - proton exchanger 1 and p21 activated kinases respectively , which are cellular factors required for macropinocytosis . Taken together , these results suggest that BTV is utilizing macropinocytosis for entry in BFA cells . Furthermore , expression of DN eps15 and treatment with an inhibitor of CME ( Pitstop 2 ) did not inhibit BTV - 1 infection of BFA cells . Interestingly , treatment of KC cells with Pitstop - 2 appeared to inhibit BTV - 1 infection , indicating that infection may be clathrin dependent in KC cells . Additionally , treatment of BFA and KC cells with Methyl - β - cyclodextrin did not inhibit infection , indicating infection is cholesterol - independent . Treatment of BFA cells with a dynamin inhibitor , Dyngo4a , siRNA targeting dynamin - 2 and expression of DN dynamin - 2 splice variant ba all inhibited BTV - 1 infection and Dyngo4a was shown to inhibit BTV - 1 entry . In addition , dynamin inhibitors Dynasore and Dyngo4a also inhibited BTV - 1 infection in KC cells . This suggests that the endocytosis pathway used by BTV - 1 in BFA and KC cells is dynamin - dependent . This thesis provides evidence that entry of BTV - 1 is determined in part by the target cell and uses a dynamin - dependent macropinocytosis - like pathway to enter mammalian cells and CME in insect cells . Chapter 1 - Introduction Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 16 1 . 1 Bluetongue virus Bluetongue virus ( BTV ) is the aetiological agent of Bluetongue disease , a haemorrhagic disease of wild and domestic ruminants and camelids ( Verwoerd , 2004 ) . BTV is the type species of the genus Orbivirus of the family Reoviridae , a virus family of both human and veterinary importance ( Mertens , 2005 ) . The reoviruses are characterised by segmented double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) genomes , encased in a multi - layered protein capsid structure ( Roy , 1992 ) . Viruses within the family Reoviridae are divided into 9 genera , four of which infect humans and animals ( Orthoreovirus , Coltivirus , Rotavirus and Orbivirus ) while the remaining 5 infect plants , insects and fish ( Albert , 1996 ) . Orbiviruses include a number of important and emerging diseases including those of high veterinary importance such as African horse sickness virus ( ASHV ) , BTV , Peruvian horse sickness virus ( PHSV ) , Equine encephalosis virus ( EEV ) and Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus ( EHDV ) . Newly emerging orbiviruses are constantly being discovered such as the emergence of a novel orbivirus discovered in Tibet , China , which was isolated from Anopholes maulatus designated the Tibet Orbivirus ( TBOV ) , with an unknown host ( Li et al . , 2014 ) and Muko virus isolated from ixodid ticks in Japan , with migratory birds as hosts ( Ejiri et al . , 2015 ) . There are currently 22 species recognised in the Orbivirus genus ( Table 1 . 1 ) . Arthropod vectors are required for transmission of all Orbiviruses known to date , with the exception of newly discovered BTV strains ( BTV - 25 and BTV - 26 ) , which have so far no identified vector . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 17 BTV is an arbovirus ( arthropod - borne ) transmitted by certain species of biting midge , Culicoides spp ( Mellor et al . , 2000 ) . There are currently 27 serotypes of BTV that have been documented , 3 ( serotype 25 , 26 and 27 ) of which have been identified in recent years ( Jenckel et al . , 2015 , Maan et al . , 2011 , Hofmann et al . , 2008 ) .

It was first postulated that Bluetongue disease was transmitted through a parasite and therefore the disease was referred to as ‘malarial catarrhal fever’ ( Hutcheon , 1902 ) . However , the full clinical presentation of the disease was not fully described until 1905 , where symptoms were listed as being a high fever between 7 - 10 days after infection , the appearance of lesions in the mouth and tongue and lastly an indicative cyanotic tongue . It was from this description that the disease then became known as ‘Blaauwtong’ , which was given by Dutch citizens in South Africa and the direct translation was used by Spreull to name the disease , ‘Bluetongue’ as the causative agent was unknown ( Spreull , 1905 ) . It was also in this paper where the suggestion of a biting insect transmitting the pathogen was first documented ( Spreull , 1905 ) . Since the first identified case , BTV has become endemic in areas of optimal vector activity within the global latitudes of 45 to 50°N and 35°S , which includes the regions of the Mediterranean Europe , North and South America , Africa , India , Australia and China , ( Mellor and Leake , 2000 ) . Historically , the global distribution of BTV has had a northern latitude limit of 50°N , however , recent incursions in Europe since 1998 have seen the virus spread to more northern European regions that were previously free of BTV ( Purse et al . , 2005 ) . In 2006 , BTV ( BTV - 8 ) reached North - west Europe ( Germany , Netherlands , Belgium , France and Luxembourg ) for the first time , expanding its distribution further north in 2007 and resulted in the first outbreak in the UK ( Wilson and Mellor , 2008 ) . Whilst the UK promptly controlled the outbreak by an aggressive vaccination campaign in 2008 , it took until 2011 for the last case of BTV - 8 to be eliminated from Sardinia , Italy ( Niedbalski , 2015 ) . However , on 21 st August 2015 , a single sheep was diagnosed with BTV - 8 in France , Allier region , Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 20 Central France . Preliminary investigations into the outbreak have identified a further 7 holdings with the virus and suggestions are that this is not a new incursion but perhaps a result of unreported circulation of the virus in France since the last reported case in 2010 or perhaps an indication of a problem with the vaccine . ( https : / / www . gov . uk / government / uploads / system / uploads / attachment _ data / file / 460582 / poa - bluetongue - btv8 - france . pdf ) . It has been suggested that the spread of BTV to northern latitudes are influenced by climate change ( Purse et al . , 2005 ) and the emergence and re - emergence of BTV in Northern Europe will be an increasing concern as global warming continues . 1 . 2 Clinical symptoms and disease Clinical signs of Bluetongue are most commonly observed in sheep and some wild ruminants , whereas infection in cattle and goats are predominantly asymptomatic . Severity of clinical signs also vary widely between breeds as well as individuals of the same host species , indicating a wide range of differences in susceptibilities . Acute symptoms include fever , malaise , anorexia , respiratory distress , excessive salivation , haemorrhages in the mucous membranes of the oral or nasal cavities , oral erosions and lesions , oedema of the head and neck and on rare occasions , a swollen cyanotic tongue ( Spreull , 1905 ) . Mortality rates ranges from 0 - 30 % but some virulent outbreak strains in highly susceptible sheep can reach higher mortality rates . Acute severe infection predominantly leads to death within 14 days of infection . Survivors endure a prolonged convalescence that Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 21 includes emaciation and deterioration in body condition . Productivity in these animals is seriously hampered with many succumbing to secondary infections , such as pneumonia . Paradoxically , despite having differential clinical presentations and severity , the pathogenesis of BTV in sheep and cattle is similar . Infection in the mammalian host begins with cutaneous transfer of the virus from the bite of the insect vector . Viral Replication most likely begins in target cells in the skin and the nearest regional lymph node followed by virus dissemination throughout the body , and further replication primarily in microvascular endothelial cells and leukocyte subsets of numerous organs ( Pini , 1976 , Mahrt , 1986 , Darpel , 2012 ) . Replication of BTV in endothelial cells results in tissue injury and necrosis ; this is reflected in the formation of lesions ( Drew et al . , 2010a ) . However , the exact mechanism by which this occurs is unknown as the directly observed viral induced endothelial cell death cannot account for the extent of vascular leakage observed ( Maclachlan et al . , 2009 ) . The clinical manifestations of severe disease in susceptible sheep typically presents with excessive bleeding and coagulopathy . In addition , infection in ruminant vascular endothelium is relatively restricted and transient but its pathology has many similarities to the human haemorrhagic viral fever , Ebola . Mainly this similarity is presented in the permeability of capillaries causing vascular leakage in infected tissues potentially mediated by tissue necrosis factor ( TNF ) of macrophages or other local cellular immune responses ( Drew et al . , 2010b , DeMaula et al . , 2002a , DeMaula et al . , 2002b ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 22 1 . 3 Transmission , overwintering and persistence The principle transmission route for BTV is vector - borne transmission through an arthropod vector , specifically via the biting midge Culicoides spp ( Mellor et al . , 1984a , Mellor et al . , 1984b ) . However , BTV has also been documented to be transmitted via alternative transmission routes , such as transplacental and oral transmission ( Menzies et al . , 2008 , Darpel et al . , 2009 , Backx et al . , 2009 , Calvo - Pinilla et al . , 2010 ) . Recently , a serotype of BTV , BTV - 26 , has been identified as being transmitted via direct contact transmission in goats and that the virus was unable to be transmitted via Culicoides spp . bite ( Batten et al . , 2014 , Batten et al . , 2013 ) . This highlights the possibility that genetic recombination of genome segments and evolution could allow the virus to adopt alternative transmission strategies . Viral persistence of BTV in its host , mammalian or insect , has been deemed the critical factor for the viruses ability to ‘overwinter’ in temperate climates and reappear the following year . Overwintering is a term coined by Nevill in 1971 ( Nevill , 1971 ) where the same virus strains reappear the following year , despite unfavourable climates in the winter affecting the adult vector . It has been discussed that BTV might be able to persist during vector - free periods via three mechanisms . Theoretically Bluetongue could potentially persist : ( 1 ) In the vector population , ( 2 ) In the host population , or ( 3 ) via an alternative transmission cycle . A diagram depicting possible persistence and overwintering strategies can be seen in Figure 1 . 1 . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 23 Species of Culicoides spp . found in the northern hemisphere survive winters in their larvae stage and so the theoretically the most likely mechanism for the virus overwintering in the vector would be transovarial transmission of the virus within infected vectors . One study identified the presence of BTV RNA in Culicoides spp . larvae , however , no viable virus was able to be rescued ( White et al . , 2005 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 24 Figure 1 . 1 Figure 1 . 1 Proposed models of alternative transmission and persistence strategies to allow BTV to overwinter The diagram shows the principle transmission route via a vector bite on the left , which occurs during optimal vector temperatures in the summer and the progression to proposed alternative transmission routes in the winter , such as transplacental transmission , transovarial transmission and possible persistence mechanisms in the vector or mammalian hosts that may allow BTV to survive vector - free periods . Adapted from ( Wilson et al . , 2008 ) Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 25 Alternatively , despite being less tolerant of low temperatures than Culex spp . mosquitoes , the adult Culicoides spp . may be able to survive mild winters ( Mellor and Leake , 2000 ) . Laboratory studies have recreated this scenario and have elucidated that the lifespan of the Culicoides spp . vector could be extended from 10 - 20 days to up to three months if the temperature remained at 10°C ( Lysyk and Danyk , 2007 ) . Supporting this potential mechanism of overwintering of the Culicoides spp . vector , there were reports of Culicoides spp . being captured during the mild winter of 2006 - 2007 in Europe ( Zimmer et al . , 2008 ) . This identified the potential of infected Culicoides spp . vectors surviving mild winters and infecting mammalian hosts the following year . However , although some adult Culicoides spp . might survive longer in mild winter conditions , it is currently unclear if they would remain active and continue to blood - feed . The possibility of additional behaviour changes , such as adult Culicoides moving indoors and maintaining host seeking activity inside animal accommodations are still under investigation ( Wilson et al . , 2008 ) . There is also potential for persistence of BTV in the ruminant host . Typically , infectious virus is not recovered from the blood of ruminant hosts , beyond 60 days post infection ( Barratt - Boyes and MacLachlan , 1994 , Heidner et al . , 1988 , Luedke , 1969 , Luedke et al . , 1969 , MacLachlan et al . , 1992 , Richards et al . , 1988 ) , but paradoxically , have shown to be PCR positive for more than 200 days ( MacLachlan et al . , 1994 ) . However the isolation of infectious virus from the skin of a sheep 6 weeks post infection in the absence of infectious virus in the blood has been reported ( Takamatsu et al . , 2003 ) . It has also previously been shown that ovine γδT - cells can remain persistently infected with BTV in the absence of Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 26 visible cytopathic effect when cultured ex vivo ( Stott et al . , 1990 , Takamatsu et al . , 2003 ) , and this has been suggested as a potential mechanism by which the host could remain latently infected ( Takamatsu et al . , 2003 ) . However , similar studies carried out by others could not replicate the finding of infectious virus in the skin beyond detectable infectious viraemia ( Melville et al . , 2004 , White and Mecham , 2004 , Lunt et al . , 2006 ) . BTV transplacental transmission in ruminants was initially reported in the 1950s , when the vaccination of pregnant ewes with live attenuated BTV vaccines resulted in losses of newborn lambs ( Schultz and Delay , 1955 ) . Later , it was observed that transplacental transmission was dependent on the stage of pregnancy that the ruminant host was infected ( Gibbs et al . , 1979 ) . The ability of BTV strains to cross the ruminant placenta had long been associated with the attenuation and modification of viral strains through serial cell culture passage in the laboratory ( Kirkland and Hawkes , 2004 ) . However more recently , transplacental transmission of the newly emerged BTV - 8 strain was observed during the Bluetongue outbreak in Europe ( Darpel et al . , 2009 , Backx et al . , 2009 , Worwa et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore some wild - type strains of BTV might also have the capability to infect ruminant offspring in utero . Nonetheless , to this date it is still unclear how BTV can survive long absences of the adult vector insects and re - merge in favourable seasons , as a definite and efficient overwintering mechanism has yet to be confirmed . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 27 1 . 4 BTV genome BTV has a linear double stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) genome , which comprises 19 , 200 base pairs ( bp ) , forming ten discrete segments . Until recently , each segment was believed to be monocistronic , however , at least two segments have cistronic open reading frames ( Belhouchet et al . , 2011 , Ratinier et al . , 2011 , Stewart et al . , 2015 ) . The ten dsRNA segments are numbered 1 to 10 and each codes for a single polypeptide , with the exception of the two smallest segments ( 9 and 10 ) , which encode VP6 and NS4 , and NS3 / NS3A and NS5 respectively ( Mertens et al . , 1984 , Belhouchet et al . , 2011 , Stewart et al . , 2015 , Ratinier et al . , 2011 ) . Table 1 . 2 details what protein each segments encodes and their known functions . Recent studies have investigated how BTV packages its genome and has identified that structural motifs at the 3’ and 5’ ends of segment 4 of BTV - 9 and segment 8 of BTV - 1 are critical for packaging as the motifs alone are able to package unrelated sequences ( Burkhardt et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , cell free RNA - RNA interaction studies have suggested that packaging is initiated with the untranslated region ( UTR ) of the smallest of the ten segments , segment 10 , which then interacts with RNA from other segments , recruiting first medium and then large segments ( Sung and Roy , 2014 ) . Additionally , mutation of certain nucleotides within the UTR of 5’ and 3’ of segment 10 , were shown to alter RNA secondary structure and subsequently render the virus unviable due to insufficient RNA packaging ( Boyce and McCrae , 2015 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 28 The structural organisation of the viral dsRNA may further aid transcription of the genomic information , as the template will be able to function effectively without getting tangled and halting the transcriptase activity ( Diprose et al . , 2001 ) .

Adapted from ( Mertens et al . , 1984 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 29 1 . 5 Virion structure The mature virion consists of a non - enveloped , 3 layered ( outer capsid , core and sub - core ) icosahedral capsid structure ( Hewat et al . , 1992b ) that is approximately 80nm in diameter . Within this structure lies the segmented , dsRNA genome ( Gouet et al . , 1999 ) . The virion is made out of seven structural proteins known as VP1 to VP7 , which include 3 minor structural proteins VP1 , VP4 and VP6 . Within infected cells , 5 distinct non - structural proteins are also expressed , NS1 , NS2 , NS3 / NS3A , NS4 and NS5 ( Belhouchet et al . , 2011 , Ratinier et al . , 2011 , Stewart et al . , 2015 ) . A schematic illustration of the virion can be seen in Figure 1 . 2 . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 30 Figure 1 . 2 Figure 1 . 2 Schematic diagram of BTV structure Diagram shows a schematic structure of BTV with outer capsid proteins shown in blue ( VP2 ) and yellow ( VP5 ) , core protein in green ( VP7 ) and sub - core protein in red ( VP3 ) . Transcriptase complex proteins and dsRNA genome can be seen located inside the sub - core . Adapted from ( Mertens et al . , 2004 ) Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 31 1 . 5 . 1 Outer capsid proteins : VP2 and VP5 The outer capsid proteins , VP2 and VP5 cover the core particle , which is formed by VP3 and VP7 . The BTV outer capsid is formed by 60 trimers ( 180 copies ) of VP2 , which forms triskelion structures and 120 trimers ( 360 copies ) of the globular protein VP5 ( Hewat et al . , 1992b , Burroughs et al . , 1995 ) . VP2 has a trimeric structure , which protrudes from the outer capsid ( Hyatt et al . , 1993 ) . Being the most exposed viral protein of the mature virion , VP2 binds to the cellular receptor prior to cell entry ( which will be discussed in further detail in section 1 . 13 . 1 ) ( Huismans , 1983 , Eaton and Crameri , 1989 , Hassan and Roy , 1999 ) , contains haemagluttinating activity ( Cowley and Gorman , 1987 ) and specific epitopes are recognised by neutralising antibodies of the infected host’s immune response ( Marshall and Roy , 1990 , Urakawa et al . , 1994 , Pierce et al . , 1995 ) . As the most variable viral protein and the target of the hosts’ neutralising antibodies , VP2 also dictates the virus serotype ( Mertens et al . , 1989 , White and Eaton , 1990 ) and so is often used in diagnostics to determine outbreak strains ( Mertens et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , VP2 has been found to be closely associated to vimentin within the cell and is suggested to be involved in virus egress ( Bhattacharya et al . , 2007 , Beaton et al . , 2002 , Wirblich et al . , 2006 , Hyatt et al . , 1993 ) . The other outer capsid protein , VP5 has been found to have membrane fusion activity , which aids cell entry of BTV ( Forzan et al . , 2004 , Hassan et al . , 2001 ) ( which will be discussed in further detail in section 1 . 13 . 2 ) . 1 . 5 . 2 Sub - Core and core proteins : VP3 and VP7 The sub - core layer is formed by 120 copies of the VP3 protein , arranged as 60 dimers organised into an icosahedral lattice . Five sets of VP3 dimers are arranged as decamers and twelve of these interact to form the final VP3 sub - core layer ( Grimes et al . , 1998 ) . VP3 Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 32 is highly conserved and studies have indicated that it plays an important role in virus assembly . Mutated forms of VP3 , which lacked a ‘dimerisation’ domain , failed to initiate the formation of the sub - core particle . However , the ability to form dimers and decamers were retained ( Kar et al . , 2004 ) . X - ray crystallography studies identified grooves on the inside of the VP3 layer that may potentially be used to organise the dsRNA genome ( Mertens and Diprose , 2004 ) . VP3 has also been shown to be associated with the enzymatically active core proteins . In particular , VP1 and VP4 have been demonstrated to associate with VP3 decamers and it has been suggested that the assembly of the sub - core particle is initiated by the association of these three proteins ( Blois et al . , 1992 , Nason et al . , 2004 ) . The outer layer of the core particle is comprised of 260 VP7 . Cryo - EM studies have shown that the VP7 trimers are positioned below the VP2 triskelion structures and interactions are observed between the uppermost part of the VP7 protein and VP2 , whereas the sides of the VP7 protein mainly make contact with other VP7 molecules and the globular VP5 trimers ( Hewat et al . , 1992a , Nason et al . , 2004 ) . The BTV core particle without VP2 and VP5 retains infectivity for Culicoides ( KC ) cells or adult Culicoides spp . , whilst core particles lose infectivity in mammalian cell systems ( Mertens et al . , 1996 ) . This suggests that VP7 plays a role in cell entry in the vector Culicoides cells ( which will be discussed in further detail in section 1 . 13 . 3 ) . Tan and colleagues created Core Like Particles ( CLPs ) using native and mutated forms of VP7 and native VP3 proteins . These CLPs were confirmed to be structurally and biochemically similar to the viral core particle . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 33 1 . 5 . 3 Minor BTV Proteins : VP1 , VP4 and VP6 Release of the virus from endosomal compartments , removes the outer capsid proteins and triggers the core particle to become transcriptionally active ( Mertens and Diprose , 2004 ) . The proteins responsible for the formation of the replicase complex are VP1 ( polymerase ) , VP4 ( mRNA capping enzyme ) and VP6 ( helicase ) . These proteins all play a role in synthesizing capped viral messenger RNA ( vmRNA ) , which is extruded from the viral core into the cell cytoplasm . The largest of the minor proteins , VP1 , is the viral RNA - dependent RNA polymerase and synthesizes dsRNA / mRNA from a plus strand RNA ( see section 1 . 6 for more detail ) . VP4 has been shown to generate the cap structure for authentic BTV transcripts by both guanylyltransferase and two distinct methyltransferase reactions ( Ramadevi et al . , 1998 , Blois et al . , 1992 ) . Through the development of a reverse genetics system for BTV , the role of VP6 in the viral replication cycle was investigated . It was shown that VP6 exhibits activity in early replication of the virus and associates with viral inclusion bodies ( VIBs ) formed by NS2 and is believed to form an essential component of the primary replication complex along with VP1 , VP3 and VP4 ( Matsuo and Roy , 2009 ) . Previous studies found that VP6 has RNA dependent ATPase and helicase properties ( Kar and Roy , 2003 , Stauber et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , VP6 is implicated in unwinding the dsRNA of the genome in preparation Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 34 for transcription . 1 . 5 . 4 Non - structural proteins : NS1 , NS2 , NS3 / 3A , NS4 and NS5 Characteristic formation of cytoplasmic tubular structures or ‘tubules’ during BTV and other Orbivirus infections is resultant of expression of non - structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) , which is the largest of the non - structural proteins at 64kDa ( Lecatsas , 1968 , Murphy et al . , 1971 , Thomas and Miller , 1971 , Tsai and Karstad , 1970 ) . NS1 is the most abundantly expressed viral protein during infection ( Van Dijk and Huismans , 1988 ) , although the functional properties of the tubules are unknown , however , there is some suggestion that they may be involved in virus pathogenicity and regulated viral protein synthesis ( Boyce et al . , 2012 , Owens et al . , 2004 ) . Expression of this highly conserved protein occurs early in replication ( Hwang et al . , 1993 , Whetter et al . , 1990 ) and is predominantly located in the cell cytoplasm , with some association with VIBs ( Brookes et al . , 1993 , Eaton et al . , 1988 ) . Infected animals elicit strong antibody responses to NS1 ( Richards et al . , 1988 , Roy et al . , 1990 ) , likely due to its cytoplasmic abundance . Therefore , detection of NS1 antibodies is considered as a potential candidate for BTV diagnostic ELISA ( Anderson et al . , 1993 ) . The non - structural protein - 2 ( NS2 ) is the major component of VIB’s ( Brookes et al . , 1993 , Thomas et al . , 1990 ) , which are believed to be the site of replication and assembly . NS2 has been shown to bind to the N - terminus of single stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) ( Fillmore et al . , 2002 , Lymperopoulos et al . , 2003 , Lymperopoulos et al . , 2006 , Theron and Nel , 1997 , Zhao et al . , 1994 ) . VIBs are rich in ssRNA and all viral core proteins but lack ribosomes ( Brookes Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 35 et al . , 1993 , Thomas et al . , 1990 ) . As NS2 is an ssRNA binding protein , it may play a vital role in RNA genome assembly ( Lymperopoulos et al . , 2003 , Lymperopoulos et al . , 2006 ) . NS2 has also been found to attract core protein VP3 but only interacts with VP7 when NS2 is in complex with VP3 , however , sub - core and core - like particles can be formed by VP1 , VP4 , VP3 and VP7 independent of NS2 and so NS2 is not required for the early stages of assembly ( Kar et al . , 2007 ) . Segment 10 of the BTV genome encodes three non - structural proteins ; NS3 / NS3A and NS5 ( Mertens et al . , 1984 , Stewart et al . , 2015 ) . The first open reading frame codes for NS3 / NS3A , whereas a second translation initiation site produces the NS3A and a second open reading frame codes for the NS5 protein . NS3 and NS3A are often associated with secretory pathway organelles such as the Golgi apparatus , smooth surfaced vesicles and at the plasma membrane during viral egress ( Hyatt et al . , 1991 , Wu et al . , 1992 ) . It has been suggested that NS3 / NS3A is expressed to higher levels in insect cells compared to mammalian cells and therefore may play a critical role during virus egress in insect cells ( Guirakhoo et al . , 1995 , Hyatt et al . , 1993 , Van Dijk and Huismans , 1988 ) . Studies using reverse genetics have shown that in mammalian cells , viruses with only NS3 and not NS3A propagate efficiently , whereas , viruses with only NS3A are severely attenuated ( Celma and Roy , 2011 ) . Mutation studies of NS3 highlighted a similar effect whereby virus particles were not released effectively due to a lack of Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 36 interaction with S100A10 / p11 ( calcium binding protein ) , indicating that the N - terminal region of NS3 plays a role of viral release in mammalian cells ( Celma and Roy , 2011 ) . This was compared to viral propagation and release in insect cells and it was identified that both NS3 and NS3A were required for viral release ( Celma and Roy , 2011 ) . However , there is evidence that NS3 / NS3A are not essential in mammalian cell replication ( van Gennip et al . , 2014 ) but NS3 / NS3A knockout viruses were unable to replicate or disseminate in Culicoides sorensis , indicating that these viral proteins are essential for virus propagation in the vector ( Feenstra et al . , 2015 ) . NS3 has also been implicated as a type 1 interferon system antagonist in mammalian cells ( Chauveau et al . , 2013 , Ftaich et al . , 2015 ) . A second overlapping open reading frame ( ORF ) has recently been identified in segment 10 , which means as well as coding for NS3 and NS3A , the second ORF also allows expression of a further non - structural protein called NS5 ( Stewart et al . , 2015 ) . NS5 is a small protein 50 - 59 residues in length that appears to localise in the nucleoli ( Stewart et al . , 2015 ) . NS5 deleted viruses do not appear to have altered replication kinetics compared to wild type ( wt ) viruses but viruses without NS5 were highly pathogenic in mice , possibly suggesting that NS5 plays a role controlling virus pathogenicity ( Stewart et al . , 2015 ) . A further overlapping reading frame was identified within segment 9 , which appears to encode a fourth non - structural protein ( NS4 ) , which is 77 to 79 amino acids in length ( Belhouchet et al . , 2011 , Ratinier et al . , 2011 ) . Protein expression analysis and confocal fluorescent microscopy has identified NS4 aggregates throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus in both BHK and KC cells ( Belhouchet et al . , 2011 ) . However , NS4 is localised in the nucleoli during early infection ( Ratinier et al . , 2011 ) . Uncertainty surrounds the NS4 Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 37 protein function but preliminary data suggests NS4 has a protective function from DNA degradation by DNase , however the exact purpose of this is yet to be identified ( Belhouchet et al . , 2011 ) and expression of NS4 conferred an advantage to BTV - 8 replication in cells in an anti - viral state ( Ratinier et al . , 2011 ) . 1 . 6 Replication Cycle The replication cycle of BTV begins with the virion binding to the outer surface of a susceptible cell by interactions between the VP2 outer capsid protein and cellular receptors ( Huismans , 1983 , Eaton and Crameri , 1989 , Hassan and Roy , 1999 ) . The virus is then taken up by the cell via endocytosis ( Forzan et al . , 2007 , Gold et al . , 2010 ) . Within endosomes , the virion is exposed to a low pH environment , which causes the virus to modify or lose its outer capsid layer ( VP2 and VP5 ) ( Hassan et al . , 2001 , Forzan et al . , 2004 ) . The core is then released into the host cell cytoplasm , via an unknown mechanism . Transcription of the BTV genome occurs within the cell cytoplasm , however , this takes place within the intact core particle in order to evade activation of the host - cells anti - viral defence responses to dsRNA ( Jacobs and Langland , 1996 , Gitlin and Andino , 2003 ) . Transcriptase functions are activated after the outer capsid layer is removed and the RNA is transcribed and extruded out of the viral core particle ( Van Dijk and Huismans , 1980 , Mertens and Diprose , 2004 ) . The dsRNA is replicated in two steps . Following unwinding of the dsRNA by the viral helicase VP6 , plus - stranded mRNAs are transcribed from the negative RNA strand ( the template ) by the polymerase ( VP1 ) . Newly synthesised mRNAs are capped by VP4 and leave the viral core for subsequent protein translation by the cellular translation machinery ( Diprose et al . , 2001 , Gouet et al . , 1999 , Grimes et al . , 1998 , Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 38 Mertens and Diprose , 2004 ) . Plus stranded RNAs are later packed into the nascent progeny sub - viral particles where they act as templates to synthesize new minus - strand RNAs ( Mertens et al . , 2004 ) . The BTV proteins are synthesized and VIBs are formed as the principal sites of RNA synthesis and particle assemble ( Kar et al . , 2007 ) . The VIB matrix protein , NS2 , is initially dispersed throughout the cytoplasm but forms inclusion sites when at least one of the two phosphorylation sites are phosphorylated ( Modrof et al . , 2005 ) . Aside from phosphorylation , no other viral factors are required for assembly of NS2 into aggregate structures similar to VIBs ( Modrof et al . , 2005 ) . As infection progresses VIBs have been shown to move along microtubules to the perinuclear region of the cell ( Eaton et al . , 1990 , Mellor , 2009 ) The ability of NS2 to bind to ssRNA indicates a probable role in assembly , replication and genome packaging of BTV ( Fillmore et al . , 2002 , Lymperopoulos et al . , 2003 , Lymperopoulos et al . , 2006 , Theron and Nel , 1997 , Zhao et al . , 1994 ) . Newly assembled virions are trafficked through the cell and are eventually released out of the cell by a budding mechanism or through destabilisation of the cell membrane , facilitated by non - structural protein NS3 and potentially NS1 ( Guirakhoo et al . , 1995 , Hyatt et al . , 1993 , Van Dijk and Huismans , 1988 , Owens et al . , 2004 ) . The non - structural protein NS1 , which forms tubules , is observed as early as 2 hours post infection and infection . Little is known about this protein and what its role is in BTV Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 39 infection but a better understanding of the role played by viral tubules may be obtained now a BTV reverse genetics systems has been developed ( Boyce et al . , 2008 ) . Following virion release from infected cells , the replication cycle is then repeated in neighbouring cells ( see Figure 1 . 3 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 40 Figure 1 . 3 Figure 1 . 3 Schematic diagram of BTV replication cycle A schematic drawing representing the lytic replication cycle of BTV , showing the major steps in the cycle . Adapted from ( Patel and Roy , 2014 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 41 1 . 7 Infectious BTV Particles Infectious BTV virions exist as at least three different particle types : whole virions , infectious sub - viral paricles ( ISVPs ) and core particles ( Verwoerd et al . , 1972 , Mertens et al . , 1987 ) . Whole virions contain all viral proteins described in section 1 . 5 . Core particles are generated after the loss of outer capsid proteins , VP2 and VP5 , during uncoating in response to a low pH environment ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) . Core particles are reported to have a 5 log reduction in infectivity for BHK cells compared to whole virions but maintain high infectivity for KC cells ( Mertens et al . , 1996 ) . Generation of ISVPs occur during proteolytic cleavage of the outer capsid protein VP2 with trypsin and chymotrypsin enzymes ( Mertens et al . , 1987 , Mertens et al . , 1989 ) . The cleaved products of VP2 remain in association with the viral particle ( Mertens et al . , 1987 , Mertens et al . , 1989 ) . These enzymes are also known to exist in Culicoides spp . saliva and exposure of whole virions to saliva results in the generation of ISVPs ( Darpel et al . , 2011 ) . Other viruses undergo cleavage of their outer capsid glycoproteins , which often aids virus entry . For example Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ( MERS CoV ) , spike ( attachment ) protein undergoes a two - step cleavage by furin , which then facilitates membrane fusion ( Millet and Whittaker , 2014 ) . Whilst membrane fusion is unlikely in a non - enveloped virus such as BTV , the cleavage of VP2 may influence virus entry and subsequently affect the virus infectivity . ISVPs generated from cell culture adapted BTV - 1 rSArrrr / 01 were observed as having a similar titre on BHK - 21 cells as whole virions but higher titres on KC cells ( Mertens et al . , 1996 , Darpel et al . , 2011 ) . However , all studies of these particles to date have only been with purified core particles and ISVPs generated from BHK - 21 cell culture adapted BTV - 1 Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 42 and infectivity of these particles may differ when generated from field isolate strains of BTV . 1 . 8 BTV Cell targets BTV can infect and replicate in ruminants as well as insect hosts . Infection in the ruminant host is characterized by its acute hemorrhagic pathology observed in sheep , which suggests that the virus has an endothelial cellular target ( see Chapter 1 , section 1 . 2 ) . Various techniques , such as PCR and in - situ hybridization and immunofluorescence microscopy have identified the presence of BTV in vascular endothelial tissues ( Brodie et al . , 1998 ) . Cytopathic effect has also been observed in bovine and ovine primary endothelial cells derived from the pulmonary artery and lung microvasculature ( Takamatsu and Jeggo , 1989 , Barratt - Boyes et al . , 1992 , DeMaula et al . , 2001 ) . However , replicating virus in endothelial cells has only been confirmed by using confocal microscopy using antibodies that were able to distinguish between structural and non - structural viral proteins ( Darpel et al . , 2012 ) . Specific subsets of leukocytes have been shown to be infected with BTV ( Barratt - Boyes et al . , 1992 ) and it is thought that the virus disseminates by infecting lymphocytes , macrophages , neutrophils , dendritic and / or monocytes ( Barratt - Boyes et al . , 1992 , Takamatsu and Jeggo , 1989 , Stott et al . , 1990 , Maclachlan et al . , 2009 ) . Replication of the virus in leukocyte subsets of infected sheep has also been confirmed by confocal microscopy ( Darpel et al . , 2012 ) , and although cellular subsets could not be conclusively identified they phenotypically resembled monocytes , dendritic cells and lymphocytes . Within the midge , BTV disseminates from the midgut cells following ingestion of an infected blood - meal by a susceptible insect host . This occurs via the insects’ haemoceol to the fat body cells , before finally replicating in the salivary glands . Only those individual Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 43 Culicoides in which the virus reaches the salivary gland can transmit BTV during subsequent blood - feeding to susceptible hosts ( Mellor , 2009 ) . 1 . 9 Virus Cell Entry Viruses can be broadly categorized into those , which are surrounded by a lipid membrane derived from the host cell ( enveloped viruses ) and others , which lack a lipid membrane ( non - enveloped viruses ) . The first step of viral entry is attachment to the target cell ( Philipson et al . , 1968 ) . The specific interactions of a virus with a cellular receptor dictate virus tropism and host range ( Wise , 1975 ) . Both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses share the same basic steps of virus cell entry of attachment and delivery of the viral genome to the cell cytoplasm . The subsequent steps after cellular attachment can be divided into endocytic routes and non - endocytic routes . The non - endocytosis route occurs by direct penetration of the plasma membrane and is used by enveloped viruses . Endocytosis routes can be utilized by enveloped viruses as an alternative entry mechanism but are primarily used by non - enveloped viruses ( Devadas et al . , 2014 , Walker et al . , 2015 ) . Viruses can subvert many different endocytosis pathways including clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) , caveolae - dependent endocytosis , macropinocytosis ( MPC ) , CLIC - GLEEC endocytosis and flotillin - dependent endocytosis , to name but a few . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 44 1 . 10 Non - endocytosis entry routes Enveloped viruses include some of the most deadly viruses , such as , Ebola ( EBOV ) , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , Chikungunya ( CHIKV ) and Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus ( MERS CoV ) . These viruses employ simplistic but effective cellular entry strategies by fusing the envelope of the virus with the plasma membrane of the host cell ( Plemper , 2011 ) . Membrane fusion of enveloped viruses is facilitated by glycoproteins ( Knowles and Person , 1976 ) , which protrude out of outer surface of the virion , ( e . g . spike proteins ) . Independent of the classification of glycoproteins , two basic steps in membrane fusion have emerged as conserved among enveloped viruses ( Sieczkarski and Whittaker , 2002 ) . In summary , the first step involves a conformational change of the fusogenic spike glycoprotein upon attachment to the target cell that results in the membrane insertion of hydrophobic , membrane attack domains ( fusion peptide or fusion loops ) . This results in the formation of a pre - hair - pin intermediate that leads to the engagement of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane ( Plemper , 2011 ) . The next step results in the refolding of the trimeric fusogenic complex into a trimeric hairpin structure , which brings the donor and target membranes into close proximity ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 , Dimitrov , 2000 , Rawat et al . , 2003 , Takeda et al . , 2003 , Waarts et al . , 2002 , Kielian et al . , 2000 , Igakura et al . , 2003 ) . Others propose a theory whereby the membranes progress towards each other through the formation of a lipid funnel ( Lowy et al . , 1990 ) , which allows merging of the curved outer regions on the leaflets , known as a hemi - fusion step ( Lakadamyali et al . , 2003 , Dimitrov et al . , 1992 ) . The inner leaflets then fuse to form a pore Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 45 ( Waarts et al . , 2002 , Kielian et al . , 2000 , Hogle , 2002 ) , which allows delivery of the viral genome into the cell cytoplasm . 1 . 11 Endocytosis entry routes Many viruses enter cells by exploiting ‘normal’ endocytosis pathways ( Mercer et al . , 2010b ) . Endocytosis is a cellular process by which molecules and surface receptors are internalised ( Alberts , 2002 ) . There are many different pathways of endocytosis that operate in mammalian cells , many of which have not been fully characterised , that deliver cargo to distinct intracellular locations . Numerous studies have identified a number of different endocytic pathways that viruses utilize for entry and for trafficking to different parts of the cell ( Pelkmans and Helenius , 2003 , Grove and Marsh , 2011 ) and often a given virus can utilize several different pathways . Distinct endocytic pathways are characterised by the cellular factors required for them to operate ( examples outlined in Table 1 . 3 . ) .

Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 48 1 . 11 . 1 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis CME is a well - studied endocytic pathway . Clathrin - coated vesicles package and transport cargo from the plasma membrane to early endosomes . There are five stages of clathrin - coated vesicle formations ( See Figure 1 . 4 ) . These are nucleation , cargo selection , clathrin coat assembly , vesicle scission and uncoating , and clathrin component recycling ( McMahon , 2011 , McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . The first step ( nucleation ) typically begins by the invagination of the plasma membrane to form a pit . Recent studies have shown that a number of nucleation proteins ( FCHO proteins , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) pathway substrate 15 ( eps15 ) and Intersectins ) bind to phosphatidylatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and define the site of clathrin recruitment and vesicle budding ( Stimpson et al . , 2009 , Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Depletion of FCHO proteins , eps15 or intersectins inhibits clathrin recruitment , showing that these proteins are essential in clathrin coated pit formation . In the second stage of CME ( cargo selection ) the adaptor protein 2 ( AP2 ) and other cargo - specific adaptor proteins are recruited to the site of nucleation where they recruit specific receptors . Following this interaction , cargo is selected and thereby prompts the assembly of the clathrin coat . Clathrin triskelia are assembled and organised around the pit and polymerization of clathrin is thought to mediate bending of the membrane as the coated pit invaginates ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2006 ) . Next dynamin is recruited by BAR - domain containing proteins at the neck of the curvature of the vesicle ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . Dynamin undergoes a GTP hydrolysis dependent conformational change that initiates vesicle scission and release of the cargo - containing clathrin - coated vesicle into the cell cytoplasm . Dynamin scission is also common in other endocytic pathways such as Caveloale - dependent , phagocytosis and IL - 2 dependent endocytosis . The ATPase heat shock cognate 70 ( HSC70 ) and its cofactor auxillin or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) aid the disassembly of the clathrin coat , the final Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 49 stage of vesicle formation , which essentially ‘uncoats’ the vesicle . The uncoated vesicles deliver cargo to early endosomes by a fusion event where they are sorted for transport either to recycling - endosomes or to late endosomes / lysosomes for degradation ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) .

Figure 1 . 4 Diagram depicting cellular requirements and mechanics of clathrin - mediated endocytosis A diagram showing the five stages of clathrin pit formation . Adapted from ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 51 1 . 11 . 2 Cholesterol - dependent endocytosis Endocytic pathways are fundamentally divided into clathrin - dependent and or clathrin - independent . There are a plethora of clathrin - independent pathways , which include lipid - dependent pathways such as caveolin - dependent and lipid - raft dependent endocytosis . The caveolae - dependent endocytosis pathway is probably the best - studied clathrin - independent pathway . Caveolae are flask - shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane , void of a clathrin coat and are instead comprised of cholesterol and glycosphigolipids , known as lipid rafts ( Pelkmans and Helenius , 2002 ) . The major protein components of these flasks are caveolins and the recently described cavins ( Hansen et al . , 2011 ) . Stability of the caveolae is achieved by the essential protein caveolin ( Fra et al . , 1995a , Fra et al . , 1995b ) . Caveolae are found on many cell types in particular endothelium , smooth muscle , and fibroblasts ( Parton and Simons , 2007 ) . Caveolae are thought to play a role in signal transduction events due to the presence of receptor and non - receptor tyrosine kinases ( Sargiacomo et al . , 1993 , Lisanti et al . , 1993 ) . The cellular cytoskeleton comprised of actin is disrupted as caveolae are internalized and dynamin is found at the neck of the caveolar vesicle ( Oh et al . , 1998 , Henley et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin is present to aid vesicle scission as it does during CME . Internalization of caveolae requires ligand binding in order to trigger a phosphorylation cascade , which induces the downstream trafficking of the caveolar vesicle ( Williams and Lisanti , 2004 ) . SV40 , cholera toxin b , shiga toxin and many others are known to be endocytosed via the caveolar pathway . However , variations in the internalization process between different ligands mean that it is difficult to describe a common pathway employed by all ligands . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 52 1 . 11 . 3 Macropinocytosis Early publications suggested macropinocytosis ( MPC ) was an indiscriminate fluid - phase uptake mechanism primarily used to internalise large volumes of fluid and membranes ( Swanson and Watts , 1995 ) . However , there is growing evidence that MPC is a triggered cellular mechanism , where multiple forms of the pathway exist ( Mercer and Helenius , 2008 , Mercer and Helenius , 2010 , Mercer et al . , 2010a , Hetzenecker et al . , 2015 ) . MPC is driven by actin polymerisation and complex signalling cascades ( Yarden , 2001 ) that initiate increased fluid - phase uptake and temporarily alter cellular behaviour ( Mercer and Helenius , 2012 ) . There are a number of characteristic features of MPC that define this pathway . MPC involves formation of large uncoated ruffles at the plasma membrane , which close up to form fluid - filled vacuoles known as macropinosomes ( reviewed in ( Swanson , 2008 ) ) . External stimuli can be required for the activation of MPC and often involves growth factors , which activate receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) ( Hubbard and Miller , 2007 , Bryant et al . , 2007 ) . However , some viruses are also known to directly initiate MPC ( Mercer and Helenius , 2008 , Locker et al . , 2000 , Huang et al . , 2008 ) . Small guanine triphosphotases ( GTPases ) play a critical role in MPC ( Van den Broeke et al . , 2014 , Begum et al . , 2004 ) . Activation of Ras GTPases by receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) initiates three arms of the signalling pathway , involving Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , ADP - Ribosylation factor 6 ( Arf6 ) , Ras related protein Rab5 ( Rab 5 ) and Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate 3 - kinase ( PI3 Kinase ) ( Bar - Sagi and Feramisco , 1986 , Bar - Sagi et al . , 1987 ) . These GTPases modulate membrane ruffling , macropinosome closure and membrane trafficking . For example , Rac1 potentiates all three types of membrane ruffling ( circular , lamellipodia and Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 53 blebs ) ( Ridley and Hall , 1992a , Ridley et al . , 1992 , Mercer and Helenius , 2008 ) , Rab 5 associates with circular ruffles and facilitates trafficking to early endosomes ( Lanzetti et al . , 2004 , Schnatwinkel et al . , 2004 ) and Arf6 is involved in endocytic membrane trafficking and plasma membrane remodelling ( Donaldson , 2005 , Svensson et al . , 2006 , Lundmark et al . , 2008b , Radhakrishna et al . , 1999 , Radhakrishna et al . , 1996 ) . Downstream to Ras GTPases , the most important kinase in MPC , p21 activated kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) is activated by Rac1 ( Parrini et al . , 2005 , Dharmawardhane et al . , 2000 ) . Dynamics and motility of the cytoskeleton is regulated by the serine / threonine kinase , PAK1 and is required at all stages during MPC ( Galisteo et al . , 1996 ) . PAK1 relocates to the plasma membrane upon activation and potentiates several effectors needed for the generation of membrane ruffles , blebs and macropinosome formation ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 1999 ) . PAK1 also drives macropinosome closure by activating carboxy (cid:0) terminal - binding protein (cid:0) 1 / brefeldin A (cid:0) ADP ribosylated substrate ( CtBP - 1 ) ( Liberali et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , PAK1 is needed from initiation of plasma membrane rearrangements to macropinosome formation and closure ( Parrini et al . , 2005 , Dharmawardhane et al . , 2000 , Liberali et al . , 2008 ) . In addition to PAK1 , a number of other kinases also play a role in the stimulation of membrane ruffling and MPC . These include protein kinase C ( PKC ) and Src Family Kinase ( SFK ) ( Miyata et al . , 1989 , Sandilands et al . , 2004 , Donepudi and Resh , 2008 ) . Other cellular factors are also involved in MPC , such as , Sodium - Proton Exchanger 1 ( NHE1 ) , which are also known to be involved in membrane ruffle formation ( West et al . , 1989 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 54 Detachment of macropinosomes from the plasma membrane allows them to move deeper into the cytoplasm where they undergo acidification ( West et al . , 1989 , Hewlett et al . , 1994 ) . Trafficking of macropinosomes appears to be dependent on cell type and the type of induction ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . Many viruses have been identified as utilising MPC , either directly for productive infection or indirectly to assist penetration of virions . There is mounting evidence that viruses can activate different combinations of cellular factors required for MPC . Some viruses that use MPC for entry also require dynamin , a GTPase ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) that was previously thought to be only required for CME . In addition , it appears that some viruses that use MPC require myosin II , whilst others do not ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . A diagram demonstrating macropinocytosis complex signalling pathway can be seen in Figure 1 . 5 . 1 . 11 . 4 Other endocytosis pathways Some of the lesser - described endocytosis pathways include Clathrin - independent carriers / GPI enriched early endosomal compartments ( CLIC - GLEEC ) endocytosis , Arf6 dependent endocytosis , Flotillin - mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 , Mayor and Pagano , 2007 , Sandvig et al . , 2008 , Stagg et al . , 2007 ) . Morphology of endocytic intermediates at the plasma membrane aids identification of endocytic processes . The formation of invaginations at the plasma membrane are often coated in either – clathrin ( CME ) , caveolin ( Caveolae - dependent endocytosis ) , - or flotillin . Flotillin are membrane proteins which form microdomains at the plasma membrane and have been associated in a number of processes that include endocytosis ( flotillin acts as a scaffolding protein within calveolar membranes , which form calveolae or calveolae - like vesicles ) or they have distinct membrane formations such as membrane ruffling seen with MPC ( Hansen and Nichols , 2009 ) , signal transduction and the regulation of the cytoskeleton ( Otto and Nichols , 2011 ) . Phagocytosis shares similarities to marcopinocytosis but requires Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 55 AP2 and is usually restricted to specialized cells such as macrophages ( Araki et al . , 1996 , Gold et al . , 1999 , Heinsbroek et al . , 2009 ) . Flotillin - mediated endocytosis appears to be independent of both clathrin and dynamin and results in the formation of flask - shaped , flotillin decorated pits which are known to traffic to the early endosomes ( Frick et al . , 2007 ) . CLIC - GLEEC endocytosis forms GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesions kinase ( GRAF1 ) coated tubular invaginations at the plasma membrane and is regulated by lipid raft domains and facilitated by actin ( Lundmark et al . , 2008a ) . Other endocytosis mechanisms are summarised in Table 1 . 3 .

Adapted from ( Mercer and Helenius , 2012 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 57 1 . 11 . 5 Viruses that utilize endocytosis for cell entry Viruses are commonly used as a tool to study cellular endocytosis mechanisms as they can often be fluorescently tagged or antibody labelled ( Pelkmans and Helenius , 2003 ) , which has allowed many viruses entry mechanisms to be elucidated . The first virus which , was shown to use CME for cellular infection was Semliki Forest virus ( SFV ) ( Helenius et al . , 1980 ) . It was identified that SFV employed a stepwise endocytic entry pathway . The outer surface of SFV firstly binds via multiple sites to the cell surface via receptors . The virus then laterally diffuses in the plane of the membrane and is sequestered into clathrin coated pits , which once internalised via CME , form clathrin coated vesicles . Vesicles are then trafficked to early endosomes , where low pH allows penetration through the endosomal membrane via viral spike glycoproteins , a process which is mediated by membrane fusion that allows delivery of the virus to the cell cytosol ( Helenius et al . , 1980 ) . Similarly it has been shown that FMDV utilize CME which is initiated by binding to the receptor ; intergrin αVβ6 and is trafficked to early endosomes ( Berryman et al . , 2005 ) . The mechanism of release from endosomal compartments is yet to be fully elucidated but may occur via a similar mechanism as the related Human Rhinovirus whereby the myristoylated viral capsid protein , VP4 induces membrane permeability via the formation of a pore ( Panjwani et al . , 2014 ) . The first virus to be confirmed as entering cells via caveolae is the non - enveloped DNA virus , Simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) ( Hummeler et al . , 1970 , Anderson et al . , 1996 , Stang et al . , 1997 , Mackay and Consigli , 1976 ) . Caveolae is a triggered endocytosis mechanism which initialises clustering of lipid raft components such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins and Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC ) class I molecules at the Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 58 plasma membrane ( Pelkmans and Helenius , 2002 , Stang et al . , 1997 , Verkade et al . , 2000 , Anderson et al . , 1998 , Simons and Toomre , 2000 ) . SV40 binds to the cell surface via MHC class I and migrates laterally along the plasma membrane until they reside in caveolae ( Anderson et al . , 1998 , Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) . Once inside caveolae initiation of signalling via tyrosine phosphorylation triggers depolymerisation of the actin cytoskeleton and production of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Upon scission via dynamin , virus loaded caveolae are internalised into the cytosol ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ) . Caveolae were first believed to be trafficked to organelles known as caveosomes ( Pelkmans et al . , 2001 ) , which were later to be disregarded as experimental artifacts and SV40 is now believed to be trafficked directly to the early endosomes ( Pelkmans and Zerial , 2005 , Pelkmans et al . , 2004 , Hayer et al . , 2010 ) . In addition to SV40 , Echovirus 1 has also been shown to utilise a caveolae entry mechanism after binding to integrins which subsequently initiates downstream signalling ( Marjomaki et al . , 2002 ) . Many viruses have been identified to use macropinocytosis for productive infection either as a direct entry mechanism or as an assisted entry mechanism ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . Mature virions of Vaccinia virus ( VV ) use a macropinocytic entry mechanism in tissue culture cells by mimicking apoptotic bodies which are internalised by cells via macropinocytosis ( Mercer and Helenius , 2008 , Locker et al . , 2000 , Huang et al . , 2008 ) . Studies revealed that macropinocytosis seems to be the predominant entry mechanism of VV ( with membrane fusion as a minor entry mechanism ) and virions are internalised into large uncoated vacuoles that fuse at low pH ( Townsley et al . , 2006 ) . VV also initiates an increase in fluid phase uptake and the virus has been shown to trigger actin rearrangements and Rac1 signalling ( Mercer and Helenius , 2008 , Locker et al . , 2000 ) . Additional inhibitor studies identified requirements for several serine / threonine tyrosine Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 59 and phosphatidylinositol kinases ( PAK1 , PKC and PI3 kinase ) , sodium - proton exchangers , myosin II and cholesterol ( Locker et al . , 2000 , Mercer and Helenius , 2008 , Chung et al . , 2005 ) . The virus was also shown as colocalising with fluid - phase markers and triggering blebbing at the plasma membrane , characteristics which typify macroinocytosis ( Lucas , 2008 ) . Group B coxsackieviruses ( CVB ) are also believed to enter cells via macropinocytosis at epithelia tight junctions and are internalised in macropinosomes that are dependent on Rab5 , Ras , Rab34 , sodium - proton exchangers and PKC ( Coyne et al . , 2007 ) . 1 . 12 Dynamin Dynamins are guanine triphosphatases ( GTPases ) that are members of a protein superfamily that includes classical dynamins , dynamin - like proteins , OPA1 , Mx proteins , mitofusins and guanylate - binding proteins / atlastins ( Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 , Schmid and Frolov , 2011 ) . One member of this family is a GTPase known as Dynamin ( Schmid and Frolov , 2011 ) . Dynamin was first identified in the temperature sensitive Drosophila dynamin Shibire mutant ( Kosaka and Ikeda , 1983 ) and later it was identified that dynamin played a role in scission of clathrin mediated pits ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 , Chen et al . , 1991 ) . Dynamin assembles into helical structures at the neck of budding vesicles . Hydrolysis of GTP promotes a conformational change in dynamin , which aids the action of vesicle scission ( Marks et al . , 2001 ) . The elucidation of the action of this mechano - chemical enzyme using energy from hydrolysis of GTP to GDP to mediate fission of clathrin coated pits from the membrane ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ) were then described to form structures around the necks of the clathrin coated pit prior to scission ( De Camilli et al . , 1995 , Takei et al . , 1995 ) . However , the precise mode of action of dynamin Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 60 has not yet been determined . As well as scission mechanisms in endocytosis , dynamin is also involved in a number of other cellular processes , such as cell signalling , trafficking events and budding from the golgi in the secretory pathway ( Urrutia et al . , 1997 , Cao et al . , 1998 , McNiven et al . , 2000a ) . There are three isoforms of dynamin ; dynamin - 1 , dynamin - 2 and dynamin - 3 which have differential tissue distributions ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin - 2 is generally ubiquitously expressed in tissues ( Cook et al . , 1994 ) but dynamin - 1 is highly expressed in neuronal cells ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 , Nakata et al . , 1991 ) while dynamin - 3 is predominantly located in brain and testis ( Cao et al . , 1998 , Raimondi et al . , 2011 ) . It has been reported that different dynamin isoforms have different protein - protein interactions and this may affect lipid binding and membrane fission activity ( Xue et al . , 2011 , Bodmer et al . , 2011 , Gray et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , each isoform of dynamin contains multiple splice variants ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin - 1 has been reported to have 8 splice variants and dynamin - 3 is thought to have 13 splice variants ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin - 2 has had four splice variants identified , which are termed dynamin - 2 aa , dynamin - 2 bb , dynamin - 2 ba and dynamin - 2 ab ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin - 2 splice variants have been reported to be involved predominantly in different endocytosis pathways such as clathrin - mediated endocytosis , caveolae - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis ( Cao et al . , 2007 ) . Dynamins comprise of five domains . The domain responsible for GTP binding and hydrolysis known as the G domain , the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain which is involved in cell signalling and cellular compartment membrane targeting , a middle domain , which is responsible for dynamin’s tetrameric structure and plays a critical role in self - assembly at the necks of vesicles ( Ramachandran et al . , 2007 ) . The GTPase effector domain ( GED ) , Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 61 which is also needed for assembly ( Marks et al . , 2001 ) and the proline rich domain ( PRD ) required for protein - protein interactions which are facilitated by the ability of the PRD to bind to SH3 domains found in other proteins ( Kessels et al . , 2001 , Mise - Omata et al . , 2003 , Lai et al . , 1999 , McNiven et al . , 2000b , Ringstad et al . , 1997 , Wigge et al . , 1997 ) . A schematic representation of the functional domains of dynamin can be seen in Figure 1 . 6 . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 62 Figure 1 . 6 Figure 1 . 6 Diagram of Dynamin functional domains Diagram shows the five functional domains of dynamin and the schematic location on the protein . Adapted from ( Faelber et al . , 2012 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 63 1 . 13 BTV Cell Entry There has been limited research in BTV cell entry and all research to date has been with cell culture adapted viruses and non - host derived cells . 1 . 13 . 1 The BTV Receptor and the Role of VP2 in Cell Attachment The cellular receptor that BTV engages with prior to entry has not been fully characterised . However , there have been a number of putative receptors identified that may interact with virions at the cell surface . Glycoproteins aided by sialic acid acting as a co - receptor have been proposed to interact with BTV in mouse L929 cells and VP2 has been shown to strongly bind to Glycophorin A in erythrocytes ( ( Eaton and Crameri , 1989 , Hassan and Roy , 1999 ) ) . There is limited evidence that the pre - binding of BTV with heparan sulphate ( HS ) , subsequently reduces virus binding to cells ( ( Mecham and McHolland , 2010 ) ) suggesting HS as a possible receptor . The cellular attachment protein of BTV has been identified as the protruding outer capsid protein , VP2 ( Huismans and Erasmus , 1981 , Eaton and Crameri , 1989 , Hassan and Roy , 1999 ) . Removal of VP2 from the virions has shown the virus particle as incapable of binding to BHK - 21 cells , which suggest that VP2 is the primary attachment protein of the virus ( Huismans and Erasmus , 1981 ) . VP2 has been shown to share structural similarities to Class I fusion proteins of enveloped viruses ( Forzan et al . , 2004 ) . VP2 is susceptible to cleavage by proteases such as chymotrypsin and trypsin , which can be found in midge saliva ( Mertens et al . , 1996 , Darpel et al . , 2011 ) . Cleavage steps of viral attachment proteins often facilitate virus entry , particularly in enveloped viruses Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 64 ( Millet and Whittaker , 2014 , Krzyzaniak et al . , 2013 , Follis et al . , 2006 ) , however , this scenario has not currently been investigated for BTV . Membrane bound BTV has been detected upon virus egress from cells ( Mertens , 2011 ) , and cleavage of VP2 may be required to facilitate fusion entry in membrane bound virions , however due to the inability of purifying membrane bound virions , this has not been studied . 1 . 13 . 2 Role of VP5 in BTV Cell Entry Class I fusion proteins of several enveloped virus share structural similarities to VP5 of BTV ( Forzan et al . , 2004 ) . VP5 has been shown to have membrane permeabilisation properties , which are hypothesised as being required for virus release from the endosomal compartments after activation from the low pH environment ( Forzan et al . , 2004 , Hassan et al . , 2001 ) . The predicted structure of VP5 is a C - terminal globular domain and an N - terminal coiled coil domain , linked by a hinge region ( Hassan et al . , 2001 , Forzan et al . , 2004 ) . The predicted amphipathic helices at the N - terminus of VP5 show structural similarities to those of the fusion proteins of enveloped viruses and VP5 is thought to play a major role in the penetration of cellular membranes . A recombinant VP5 expressed as a fusion protein with Glutathione S - transferase was shown to bind and permeabilise mammalian and Culicoides cells and mutant forms of VP5 which lack amphiphatic helices were shown not to exhibit binding and penetration activity . This confirmed that these structures are essential for fusion activity and cellular membrane destabilisation ( Hassan et al . , 2001 ) . The fusion activity of VP5 is thought to be responsible for the formation of syncytium in infected cells ( Forzan et al . , 2004 ) . In addition , VP5 was shown to co - purify with lipid raft domains and a motif with similarities to a soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 65 fusion attachment protein receptor ( SNARE ) domain was identified in VP5 and was shown to associate with lipid rafts ( Bhattacharya and Roy , 2008 ) . 1 . 13 . 3 Role of VP7 in BTV Cell Entry The structural protein , VP7 , which forms the outer surface of the BTV core particle have been shown to confer infectivity in Culicoides spp . and KC cells , a phenomenon which is not shared with mammalian cells ( Mertens et al . , 1987 , Mertens et al . , 1996 , Mellor et al . , 2000 ) . This is suggestive that core particles may partake in alternative entry mechanisms to whole virions in insect cells ( Tan et al . , 2001 ) . An arginine - glycine - aspartate ( RGD ) tripeptide has been identified in the VP7 protein of BTV . This motif , located at amino acid ( aa ) residues 168 to 170 has been shown to be exposed on the exterior of core particles , suggesting a possible role in cell entry ( Grimes et al . , 1998 ) . RGD tripeptides have been shown to interact with the integrin family , as similar mechanism as seen with FMDV ( Jackson et al . , 1997 , Jackson et al . , 2004 ) . The externally exposed nature of the RGD motif may indicate a role in attachment with insect cells . ( Xu et al . , 1997 , Tan et al . , 2001 ) . Whilst monoclonal antibodies to the RGD peptide blocked binding of core particles to KC cells ( Tan et al . , 2001 ) , BTV cores were shown not to interact with integrin αVβ3 ( Arnaout et al . , 2002 ) . Glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) have been shown to inhibit binding of core particles to KC cells where potency of binding correlated with the increased sulphination of the GAGs and therefore negative charge . ( Hutchinson . , 1999 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 66 1 . 13 . 4 BTV and Endocytosis Two different endocytosis pathways have been independently proposed as cell entry mechanisms of BTV . The first identified pathway , CME used non - purified virus and culture - adapted BTV - 10 and endocytosis mechanisms were investigated in HeLa and Vero cells ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . The second pathway identified , MPC , employed purified BHK - 21 cell culture - adapted BTV - 1 and BHK - 21 cells ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . Both studies agree that BTV entry requires a low pH dependent step , indicating that virus delivery to an acidic compartment facilitates productive infection . Both observations are consistent with the virus using receptor - mediated endocytosis as a mechanism of cellular internalisation ( Forzan et al . , 2007 , Gold et al . , 2010 ) . CME was proposed as the internalisation mechanism used by BTV - 10 by Forzan and colleagues ( 2007 ) . A macropinocytosis - like cell entry mechanism was proposed for BTV - 1 by Gold et al . , ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . The first study showed reduced virus internalization and infection when clathrin - dependent endocytisis was inhibited by small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) which target the μ2 subunit of the clathrin - AP2 adaptor complex in HeLa cells ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , virus appeared to co - localise with fluorescently labelled transferrin at the cell surface , and treatment of Vero cells with clathrin inhibitor , Chlorpromazine reduced virus infectivity ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . The study also found that treatment of cells with Nystatin , a cholesterol inhibitor had no impact on BTV infection ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . However , as the virus used in this study was not purified , it is possible that components in the cell lysate , such as growth factors and cytokines could activate certain endocytosis mechanisms ( Bryant et al . , 2007 ) . Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 67 In contrast , BTV uptake and infection were not inhibited in BHK - 21 cells by expression of DN mutants of AP180 ( a protein required for CME ) or the DN dynamin - 2 isoform ‘aa’ , all of which have been shown to inhibit CME ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . Instead , BTV internalisation was inhibited by the MPC inhibitors EIPA and Cytochalasin - D and virus was shown to co - localise with a known marker for MPC , dextran ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . Paradoxically , inhibition of BTV entry was observed in cells treated with dynamin inhibitor , Dynasore in two independent studies ( Du et al . , 2014 , Gold et al . , 2010 ) . However , upon over expression of DN dynamin - 2 ‘aa’ , no inhibition in infection was observed . Therefore , further investigation in to the role of dynamin in BTV infection and entry is required . As each study had a number of experimental differences , such as virus purification status , virus serotype and cell type used to study endocytosis mechanisms , it is possible that the differences observed in the endocytosis mechanism utilised by BTV is influence by one or several of these factors . 1 . 13 . 5 BTV Trafficking Until recently , attempts at fluorescently tagging BTV have failed due to incorrect assembly , however , the generation of a tetracysteine - tagged BTV allowed visualisation of virus trafficking ( Du et al . , 2014 ) . Live cell imaging of the tagged BTV - 10 revealed that VP2 and VP5 segregate after 15 minutes of internalisation after trafficking from the early endosome to the late endosome ( Du et al . , 2014 ) . However , previous attempts using antibody Chapter 1 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 68 labelling of virus , identified BTV - 1 localised with late endosomal compartments after 120 minutes of entry ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . Again , the reported variation in the rate of BTV internalisation could reflect differences in endocytosis mechanisms used by different virus strains and / or be a result of the specific target cells utilised . 1 . 14 Aims The aim of this thesis is to elucidate the endocytosis mechanisms employed by a low passage , field - isolate strain of BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 in host - derived cells . Previous work investigating BTV endocytosis mechanisms have used cell culture adapted BTV in cell types that are not naturally infected by the virus . The objectives of this study are : • To purify field isolate BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 from Culicoides spp . cells to retain a field - type phenotype by not adapting the virus to mammalian cell culture . • To investigate entry mechanisms in bovine foetal aorta endothelial ( BFA ) cells ( endothelial cells are a natural cellular target during infection ) . • To investigate entry mechanisms in Culicoides spp . ( KC ) cells ( cell types that are naturally targeted during infection in the field ) . The information from this study will contribute by improving understanding understanding the endocytosis mechanism BTV uses in host cells and may aid the development of future drug therapeutics . Specifically this thesis is investigating the following hypothesis : “Bluetongue virus cellular entry mechanisms are influenced by target host cell” Chapter 2 – Materials and Methods Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 71 2 . 1 Cells and Viruses 2 . 1 . 1 Cell Lines An embryonic cell line isolated from larvae of Culicoides ( variipennis ) sonorensis , known as KC cells , were kindly supplied by Sally Wechsler , USDA to the Pirbright Institute ~ 15 Years ago . KC cells were propagated at 28°C in Schneiders insect media with L - glutamine ( Sigma ) containing 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) . Baby Hamster Kidney - 21 ( clone 13 ) ( BHK - 21 ) cells ( Public Health England , European Collection of Cell Cultures ( ECACC ) ) were propagated grown at 37°C in Glasgows Minimum Essential Medium ( GMEM ) ( Sigma ) containing 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma ) , 1 % L - Glutamine ( Sigma ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) . Bovine Aorta Endothelial Foetal ( BFA ) cells ( Public Health England , European Collection of Cell Cultures ( ECACC ) ) were propagated at 37°C in Nutrient Mixture F12 - Hams media ( Sigma ) containing 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma ) , 1 % L - Glutamine ( Sigma ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 72 2 . 1 . 2 Cell counting Cells were diluted 1 in 10 in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline ( D - PBS ) ( Sigma ) . Cell suspensions ( 100µl ) were then loaded on to cassettes of the Moxi Flow ( Orflo ) system and cell number was determined as per manufacturers’ instructions . 2 . 1 . 3 Viruses BTV , Serotype 1 , originated from a sheep in the Gibraltar outbreak in 2007 was isolated by the non - vesicular reference laboratory ( NVRL ) by incubation of sheep blood in C sonorensis ( KC ) cells . The isolate was designated BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 KC1 ( The Pirbright Institute , BTV Reference Collection ) , passaged twice more in KC cells and used for virus purification ( see section 2 . 2 ) and all subsequent experiments . Purified virus was stored at 4°C as it Infectivity reduces during freeze - thawing . 2 . 2 Virus Purification Purification of the BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 KC1 isolate was achieved by largely following the protocol described by ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) . However , as this was a field strain virus and the experiments in this thesis required that the virus was not mammalian cell culture adapted , virus was propagated in 2 extra passages of KC cells , instead of BHK - 21 cells as described ( Mertens et al . 1987 ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 73 The BTV purification method by Mertens et al . ( 1987 ) was adapted in a number of ways to allow purification of BTV , solely generated in insect cell cultures . The first adaptation was to infect KC cell cultures in T175 tissue culture flasks , as opposed to the originally used roller bottles . BTV - infected BHK - 21 cells typically dislodge from plastic tissue culture flasks by approximately 48 hours post infection ( hpi ) , which makes collection of cells from roller bottles relatively straightforward . This procedure is more suited in T175 tissue culture flasks than roller bottles as cells are grown on an easily accessible flat surface . As KC cells perpetually grow on top of one another ( subject to nutrient resources ) , as opposed to a monolayer , it meant the number of flasks infected could be reduced . Additionally this method reduced infected waste while still maintaining a high enough cell density to generate a suitable concentration of virus needed for the purification procedure . Enough KC2 passage virus was propagated in order to infect x55 T175 tissue culture flasks required for virus purification , meaning the final purified virus had undergone three passages in KC cells in total . Secondly , most of the replicated virus is found within infected KC cells . Virus recovery was maximised by collection of non - adherent cells by pipetting as well as adherent cells by mechanical scraping . As this purification procedure had never previously been tested on KC cells , it was unknown as to whether the lysis step in the procedure would be sufficient to release the virus from intact KC cells . Effectiveness of the lysis step was analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS PAGE ) ( see chapter 3 , section 3 . 3 . 1 , Figure 3 . 2 ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 74 Thirdly , due to the lack of cpe produced by BTV in infected KC cells , a quantitative reverse - transcriptase PCR ( qRT - PCR ) was carried out during the virus propagation steps to ensure sufficient virus was present prior to proceeding with the virus purification ( qRT - PCR was carried out in collaboration with Karin Darpel and Marc Guimera ) . Table 2 . 1 shows an example of the cycle threshold ( ct ) values for each passage through KC cells .

( 1987 ) BTV particles are purified using three sequential sucrose gradients after propagating virus in BHK - 21 cells ( ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) ) . In the KC cell modified method , three distinct , viscous , opaque bands were present after the first gradient step , as opposed to a single solid disc described for BHK - 21 cells . Virus was located at the expected interface between 40 % and 66 % sucrose . In order to successfully collect purified virus , the sucrose above and below the purified viscous band was removed prior to being layered on to a further two sucrose gradients . Following the second sucrose gradient , instead of a firm disc , a fluffy distinct band was located at the interface ( between the 40 % and 66 % sucrose ) . This band was collected and passed through a final gradient containing 40 % sucrose with 0 . 1 % N - Lauroylsarcosine sodium salt ( NLS ) as the top layer and a 66 % sucrose cushion as the bottom layer . At the final sucrose gradient a single distinct , blue / white band was located at the expected position at the sucrose interface ( between the 40 % and 66 % sucrose ) , which can be observed in Figure 2 . 1 . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 75 This band was harvested and stored in 40 % sucrose supplemented with 0 . 1 % NLS at 4°C and called purified BTV - 1 .

Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 77 2 . 3 Virus Assays 2 . 3 . 1 Measuring virus infectivity using Fluorescent TCID50s Ninety - six - well flat - bottomed tissue culture plates were seeded either with BHK - 21 or BFA cells the day prior to TCID 50 experiments to ensure that cells were confluent on the day of the experiment ; or with KC cells , which were seeded on the day of the experiment . Ten - fold virus dilutions were set up and 100 µL was added to wells in at least quadruple for each dilution . Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37°C or 28°C for BHK - 21 and BFA cells or KC cells respectively . Cells were then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) ( Sigma ) for 1 hour washed in D - PBS 3 times before a final addition of D - PBS to each plate . Immunofluorescence labelling was carried out after permeabilising cells with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) for 20 minutes at room temperature . Cells were incubated with guinea pig anti - BTV antibody ( Orab279 ) ( The Pirbright Institute ) diluted 1 in 2000 in 0 . 5 % Bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Melford ) / D - PBS ( Sigma ) for 1 hour at room temperature , followed by three washes with D - PBS and incubation with AlexaFluor - 488 conjugated to goat anti - guinea pig secondary antibody ( 1 : 200 in 0 . 5 % BSA / D - PBS ) for 1 hour at room temperature . Finally , cells were then washed with D - PBS ( Sigma ) 3 times and either examined under a fluorescent microscope ( Leica ) or with the fluorescent Enzyme - Linked ImmunoSpot ( ELISPOT ) reader ( AID Elispot ) . Green cells were counted as positive for virus , i . e . green cells within a well ( above background controls ) , were scored as positive for tissue culture infective dose 50 ( TCID 50 ) calculation . TCID50’s were calculated using the Spearman - Karber formula : Log 10 Median Dose = X 0 – d / 2 + d * ( Σ r / n ) Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 78 This method allowed cells that do not show cpe to be compared to those that display lytic effects of the virus . 2 . 3 . 2 Virus Infection Assays Many experiments within this thesis investigate the effect of specific inhibitory factors against cellular components and , as a result , their effect on BTV - 1 infection . After treating cells with pharmacological inhibitors ( see section 2 . 9 . 1 ) , small - interfering ( siRNA ) ( see section 2 . 5 . 14 ) or dominant - negative ( DN ) proteins ( see section 2 . 5 . 13 ) , cells were then infected with 0 . 12µg / mL purified BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 KC3 which had been diluted in serum free GMEM ( Sigma ) for BFA cells or serum free Schneiders media ( Sigma ) for KC cells . Virus was first allowed to adsorb to the cells by allowing virus to attach at 37°C for BFA cells or 28°C for KC cells for one hour . After adsorption , cells were washed 3 times with cell culture media and replaced with fresh GMEM ( Sigma ) / Schneiders media ( Sigma ) containing 1 % / 5 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Sigma ) and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin for the duration of the remaining 11 hour infection , continued at the appropriate temperature for each cell type . Following infection , cells were either processed for flow cytometry analysis ( see section 2 . 7 ) or confocal microscopy ( see section 2 . 8 ) . 2 . 3 . 3 Passaging viruses One hundred µL of the initial BTV1 GIB2007 / 01 KC1 inoculum was used to infect KC cells . After the second passage on KC cells ( KC2 ) , cells were dislodged from the flask and pelleted at 1000 rpm for 3 minutes . One ml of infectious supernatant was diluted in 35 ml of complete cell culture medium and subsequently used to infect T175 flasks seeded with Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 79 BFA , BHK - 21 or KC cells . Virus was passaged in BFA or BHK - 21 cells upon appearance of cytopathic effect ( cpe ) . Due to the slow replication cycle and lack of cpe in KC cells , virus was passaged every seven days to ensure virus budding had taken place . This was repeated until passage 6 in each cell line was reached . 2 . 3 . 4 Virus Uptake Assays Cells ( BFA and KC ) , which had been treated with inhibitors , as well as control cells , which had been treated with equivalent inhibitor diluent ( see section 2 . 9 . 1 ) were used for virus entry experiments . Cells were infected with 6µg / ml BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 KC3 ( diluted in serum free media , as described in section 2 . 3 . 2 ) and incubated on ice for one hour on ice to allow adsorption of virus and synchronisation of virus entry . After adsorption of virus on ice , cells were washed 3 times with serum free cell culture media and warmed to 37°C for BFA cells or 28°C for KC cells for durations of 30 minutes , 1 hour , 90 minutes or 2 hours post virus attachment . Cells were then processed for confocal microscopy ( see section 2 . 8 ) . 2 . 4 Protein Analysis 2 . 4 . 1 SDS PAGE SDS PAGE gels were used to analyse viral proteins with a method adapted from ( Laemmli , 1970 ) method . Eight % resolving gels and 5 % stacking gels were prepared ( see standard solutions in Appendix 9 - A ) and polymerised gels were loaded with 20µL of pre - prepared Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 80 denatured samples . Samples were prepared by adding 3x SDS loading buffer ( New England Biolabs ) together with 12 . 5mM DTT ( New England Biolabs ) and boiled at 96°C for 5 minutes . All samples were loaded in parallel with a Precision Plus Protein ladder ( Biorad ) and run in Tris - glycerine running buffer at 90V until the dye front just runs off the gel . 2 . 4 . 2 Coomasie and Silver Staining SDS - PAGE gels were stained for analysis with Coomasie Brilliant Blue stain ( Sigma ) or Pierce Silver Stain ( Thermo Scientific ) as per manufacturers’ instructions . 2 . 4 . 3 Dynamic Light Scattering The zetasizer µV ( Malvern ) was used to size purified virus particles . Virus was diluted 1 in 10 in 40 % sucrose containing 1 % NLS in a 100µL volume and placed in a disposable optically clear cuvette ( BioRad ) . Samples were read either direct from 4°C storage or heating at 37°C for 5 hours . Settings were adjusted according to sample diluent ; hence the 40 % sucrose setting was selected prior to reading . Samples were read for 40 reads at 40 seconds each in order to gather accurate information for sample size composition . The zetasizer µV was always calibrated by running arc beads ( Life Technologies ) and in - house prepared liposomes , which have a known size , prior to sample reading . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 81 2 . 4 . 4 Bio - Rad protein assay The Bio - Rad protein assay ( based on the Bradford method ) was used to quantify the protein content of purified BTV , as per manufacturers’ instructions . Albumin standards of known protein concentrations were used to generate a standard curve . Optical Density ( OD ) readings were obtained via the Spectramax plate reader . 2 . 4 . 5 The bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay The Pierce BCA protein assay kit ( Life Technologies ) was used to quantify protein content of whole cell lysates for western blot analysis , as per manufacturers’ instructions . Albumin standards were supplied within the kit and used to generate a standard curve for protein concentration inference . OD readings were obtained via the Spectramax plate reader . 2 . 4 . 6 Making protein lysates Cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) containing protease inhibitors , ProteoBlock , a protease cocktail inhibitor ( Fermentas ) at a final 1x concentration . 2 . 4 . 7 Western Blots Proteins that had been separated previously by SDS PAGE were transferred by electrophoresis from SDS PAGE gels on to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Amersham Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 82 biosciences Ltd ) at 100V for 1 hour in transfer buffer . After transfer , membranes were blocked for 1 hour to prevent non - specific binding of primary antibodies by incubating membranes in D - PBS with 5 % milk ( Marvel ) and 0 . 05 % tween ( Sigma ) . Primary antibody was diluted in D - PBS with 5 % milk ( Marvel ) and 0 . 05 % tween ( Sigma ) at a dilution of 1 in 1000 ( 0 . 5ug / ml ) for anti - Dynamin Hudy 1 ( Millipore ) , or 1 in 1000 for anti - BTV Orab276 ( The Pirbright Institute orbivirus reference antibody collection ) or anti - Actin ( Millipore ) and then incubated with the membrane overnight at 4°C whilst gently shaking . Membranes were then washed three times for 10 minutes each in D - PBS and 0 . 05 % tween ( Sigma ) followed by incubation with a secondary IgG HRP goat anti - mouse ( diluted as 1 in 5000 in block buffer ) for 1 . 5hrs at room temperature whilst shaking . The membranes were washed 3 times in D - PBS and 0 . 05 % tween ( Sigma ) , followed by 4 to 5 changes in deionised water ( dH 2 O ) changes . Finally membranes were developed using the Super Signal , West Pico Chemoluminescent Substrate ( Thermo Scientific ) as per manufacturers’ instructions . Western blots were then either imaged using films or the Kodak Image Station 4000R Digital Imaging System operated by Molecular Imaging Software v 5 . 3 . 4 . 17821 ( Carestream health inc . ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 83 2 . 5 DNA and RNA analysis 2 . 5 . 1 Viral RNA Extraction Viral RNA was extracted from infected cell culture supernatant using the Qiamp viral RNA mini kit ( Qiagen ) , as per manufacturers’ instructions . Viral RNA was stored short term at + 4C or at - 20C for subsequent analysis by qRT - PCR . 2 . 5 . 2 Messenger RNA extraction Messenger RNA ( mRNA ) was extracted using Dynabeads ™ mRNA Direct extraction kit ( Ambion from Life Technologies ) as per manufacturers’ instructions . The extracted mRNA was used to confirm KC cell dynamin - 2 sequence by PCR , which was identified from the Culicoides spp . Genome project ( see section 2 . 5 . 5 / 2 . 5 . 6 / 2 . 5 . 9 ) . 2 . 5 . 3 RT - PCR qRT - PCR carried out using extracted viral RNA ( section 2 . 5 . 1 ) was carried out by colleagues at The Pirbright Institute , using the method described either by ( Shaw et al . , 2007 , Maan et al . , 2015 ) which amplify either segment 1 or segment 9 of the BTV genome respectively . qRT - PCR was carried out to confirm whether virus has successfully replicated in KC cells as inferred by a decrease of ct values ( increase in RNA ) from the initial inoculum taken on day 0 to the sample taken on day 5 post infection . ( see Table 2 . 1 ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 84 2 . 5 . 4 Quantifying DNA or RNA One µl of purified DNA or RNA was loaded on to the NanoDrop1000 ( Thermo scientific ) spectrophotometer after blanking with molecular grade water . Results were interpreted as per manufacturers’ instructions . 2 . 5 . 5 Reverse transcription Extracted mRNA ( 5μl ) was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA ( cDNA ) by using first strand Superscript III Reverse Transcription kit ( Life Technologies ) to allow for PCR amplification of KC cell dynamin - 2 gene . The mRNA , complementary DNA was generated from annealing random hexamers or one of two reverse primers , which were based on KC cell dynamin - 2 scaffold sequence generated from the Culicoides spp . Genome project , as detailed below : ‘Reverse primer 3 – AATAGGGCAAAGGTGTGTCG’ ‘Reverse primer 2 – CAACCTCGTCTGCAGTCTCA’ Two μl primer or random hexamer ( 2μM ) was added to 5μl mRNA and 1μl 10mM dNTP’s and 3μl nuclease free water . The mixture was incubated at 65°C for 5 minutes and then placed on ice for 2 minutes . After annealing primers or random hexamers , fragments were synthesized by the addition of the following components to the reaction mix : 10X reaction buffer , 4μl 25mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1M DTT and 1μl RNase OUT ( 40U / μl ) , 1uL superscript III RT enzyme ( except for the mRNA plus no RT enzyme for the negative negative control ) and the mixture was incubated Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 85 at 50°C for 45 minutes . Template cDNA was then used to amplify KC cell dynamin - 2 ( see section 2 . 5 . 6 ) . 2 . 5 . 6 Polymerase Chain Reaction Amplification of fragments of the KC cell Dynamin - 2 gene was carried out in order to determine the Culicoides spp . Dynamin - 2 sequence proposed by the Culicoides spp . Genome project . Five primers were manually designed used in different combinations in order to amplify overlapping fragments of the gene . These primers were : Forward 1 ( F1 ) – 5’TTGCTGTAGTGGGTGGACAA3’ ( starts at bp position 83 ) Forward 2 ( F2 ) – 5’TGCGTGATCGACTTCAAAAG3’ ( starts at bp position 872 ) Reverse 1 ( R1 ) – 5’GCACCACCCGATAACTCATT3’ ( starts at bp position 1048 ) Reverse 2 ( R2 ) – 5’CAACCTCGTCTGCAGTCTCA3’ ( starts at bp position 1804 ) Reverse 3 ( R3 ) – 5’AATAGGGCAAAGGTGTGTCG3’ ( starts at bp position 1729 ) The following combinations of primers were used to amplify the proposed Dynamin - 2 gene from the cDNA generated using reverse primer 2 ( see section 2 . 5 . 5 ) , as this was determined as being the best quality cDNA : F1 - R1 , F2 – R2 , F2 – R1 and F2 – R3 . Fragments were amplified using KOD polymerase ( Novagen , USA ) . The following reaction condition were used on an Eppendorf vapo - protect mastercycler thermocycler . Denaturation : 95 °C for 2 minutes The below conditions were run for 30 cycles in total : Denaturation : 95 °C for 20 seconds Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 86 Annealing : 55 °C for 10 seconds Elongation : 70 ° C for 50 seconds PCR products were analysed using gel electrophoresis and sanger sequencing ( see section 2 . 5 . 7 / 2 . 5 . 9 ) . 2 . 5 . 7 Gel electrophoresis For 1 % agarose gels , 1 g agarose ( Sigma ) was heated in 100ml tris - borate EDTA ( TBE ) buffer until dissolved . After cooling for 5 minutes , 3 µL Ethidium bromide ( Sigma ) was added to the dissolved agarose and poured into a gel cast with a comb and left to set . The agarose gel was placed into a gel tank with TBE buffer and samples were loaded with 1x loading buffer ( New England Biolabs ) . Gels were run at 100 V for approximately 1 hour and imaged using Biorad gel doc ( Biorad ) . 2 . 5 . 8 DNA purification In order to sequence the amplified DNA fragments , DNA was purified from PCR product using PCR Clean up kit from Qiagen ( Qiagen ) following manufacturers’ instructions . 2 . 5 . 9 Sanger sequencing Sanger sequencing was carried out on purified amplified KC cell dynamin - 2 gene PCR products ( see section 2 . 5 . 6 ) to determine sequence similarity to sequences generated from the Culicoides spp . Genome project . BigDye ® Terminator v3 . 1 cycle sequencing kit Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 87 ( Applied Biosystems UK ) and was used to sequence purified DNA as per manufacturers’ instructions . Sample reactions were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended with 25 μl HI - DI formamide before being placed on ABI 3730 Analyser to determine sample sequences . 2 . 5 . 10 Ecoli Transformation Plasmid DNA ( 1μl of either WT or DN dynamin - 2 ( obtained from McNiven Laboratory ) or Eps15 plasmids ( obtained from Benmerah Laboratory , Cochin Institute , Paris ) was added to 50μl DH5α competent cells ( Invitrogen ) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes . The cell - plasmid mix was then heat shocked at 42°C for 40 seconds and then placed back on ice for 2 minutes before adding 1 ml S . O . C media ( Life Technologies ) . Transformed cells were incubated at 37°C for one hour in a shaking incubator and then plated on to Luria broth ( LB ) agar plates ( The Pirbright Institute ) containing kanamycin ( Gibco ) . 2 . 5 . 11 Plasmids A number of plasmids were used for this thesis to enable expression of both wild - type ( WT ) and dominant - negative ( DN ) proteins within the cell lines used in this study ( see section 2 . 1 . 1 ) . Firstly , DN and WT dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) splice variant constructs ( encoding DNM2 splice variants - aa , - bb and – ba ) were obtained from the Mc Niven laboratory ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , USA ) . Furthermore , DN and WT eps15 constructs ( DIII and EH29 ) and control plasmid ( D3Δ2 ) were supplied by Alexandra Benmerah ( Universt é Paris Descarte , Paris , France ) . Control plasmid peGFP were purchased from Clonetech . See table 2 . 2 . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 88 Table 2 . 2 Plasmid function and construction Construct name Protein encoded Protein function Publication detailing construction and sequence details peGFP - WTDNM2aa WT Dynamin - 2 aa ( GFP fusion ) GTP binding protein Cao et al . , 1998 peGFP - DNDNM2aa DN Dynamin - 2 aa ( GFP fusion ) Inhibits GTP binding protein DNM2aa Cao et al . , 1998 peGFP - WTDNM2ba WT Dynamin - 2 ba ( GFP fusion ) GTP binding protein Cao et al . , 1998 peGFP - DNDNM2ba DN Dynamin - 2 ba ( GFP fusion ) Inhibits GTP binding protein DNM2ba Cao et al . , 1998 peGFP - WTDNM2bb WT Dynamin - 2 bb ( GFP fusion ) GTP binding protein Cao et al . , 1998 peGFP - DNDNM2bb DN Dynamin - 2 bb ( GFP fusion ) Inhibits GTP binding protein bb Cao et al . , 1998 peGFP - DIII Eps15 with COOH terminal domain removed ( i . e . has AP2 binding domain removed ) ( GFP fusion ) Inhibits eps15 function Benmerah et al . , 1998 peGFP - D3 (cid:1) 2 EPS15 with EH and AP2 binding domain removed ( GFP fusion ) Mimics WT eps15 function , no inhibition observed .

EcoRI ( New England Biolabs ) and HindIII ( New England Biolabs ) restriction sites were used for Dynamin - 2 plasmids and BamHI ( New England Biolabs ) and XbaI ( New England Biolabs ) were used for Eps15 plasmids . Double enzyme digests were carried out as per manufacturers’ instructions . 2 . 5 . 14 Transfection of plasmid DNA Transfection of BFA cells with plasmid DNA proved to be challenging . After trialling several optimisation conditions and different transfection reagents , it was found that Xtreme - Gene 9 transfection reagent ( Roche ) with a 6 : 1 ( transfection reagent : DNA ) ratio led to the highest number of cell transfected cells and subsequently expressing the encoded proteins . Manufacturers’ instructions were followed for transfection of plasmid DNA and transfected cells were allowed to express the protein for 6 to 48 hours ( experiment dependent ) . Dominant - negative ( DN ) and wild - type ( WT ) dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) splice variant constructs ( - aa , - bb and – ba ) were supplied by the Mc Niven laboratory ( Mayo Clinic , Rochester , USA ) . DN and WT eps15 constructs ( DIII and EH29 ) and control plasmid ( D3Δ2 ) were supplied by Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 90 Alexandra Benmerah ( Universt é Paris Descarte , Paris , France ) . Control plasmid peGFP ( Clonetech ) was transfected along with plasmids described above using XtremeGene 9 ( Roche ) in a 6 : 1 ( reagent : plasmid ) ratio as per manufacturers’ instructions . Cells were transfected for a total of 16 hours prior to infecting cells . 2 . 5 . 15 Transfection of siRNA siRNA targets was designed against the published bovine dynamin - 2 gene ( Accession number : NM _ 001099369 . 1 ) using the ThermoFischer siRNA selection tool . Ten promising hits were generated , one of which , siRNA141 – 5’GCTCTGTGCTCGAGAACTT3’ ( targets bp position 141 ) , had previously been published and validated ( Dhaminka et al . , 2008 ; Dhaminka et al . , 2007 ) ) . This siRNA target along with an additional siRNA that was not located in the region of splicing siRNA657 – 5’GGGATGTCCTGGAGAACAA3’ ( targets bp position 657 ) were selected for this study . Scrambled sequences for each of the bovine dynamin - 2 targeting siRNA’s were also purchased and used as controls . Transfection of 20pmol ( unless otherwise stated ) of two Dynamin - 2 targeting siRNAs and scrambled controls , as single or duplex transfections were carried out using transfection reagent Dharmafect 4 ( Dharmacon GE Healthcare ) as per manufacturers’ instructions . siRNA’s were transfected for 48 hours prior to BTV infection or control ligand uptake experiments . Cells were then infected or allowed to take up control ligand . Infected cells would have been transfected for a total of 70 hours . siRNA transfection conditions were optimised as detailed in chapter 4 , section 4 . 2 . 1 . 2 . 5 . 16 Preparation of dsRNA for BTV genome amplification Double stranded RNA genome was prepared by using TRIZOL reagent and the guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure described by ( Attoui et al . , 2000 ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 91 2 . 5 . 17 Amplification of dsRNA BTV genome segments Full - length amplification of cDNA ( FLAC ) technique was used to amplify BTV dsRNA genome segments , as described by ( Maan et al . , 2007 ) . Briefly , the method works by ligating an self - priming anchor primer 5’ p - GAGGATTCTAAAC / iSp9 / TCCAGTTTAGAATCC - OH 3’ to the TRIZOL extracted dsRNA , this allows each segment to be attached to this anchor primer . This is then run on an agarose gel and segments are cut out and recovered using silica binding methods . cDNA is generated by carrying out first strand reverse transcriptase reaction , using the anchor primer to generate the sequence . Segments were then sequenced as described in section 2 . 5 . 9 . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 90 2 . 6 Sequence Analysis 2 . 6 . 1 Pipeline for Sequence Alignments Bovine splice variants of dynamin - 2 were identified by aligning all published cDNA transcript sequences against the full length Dynamin - 2 gene . Bovine ( Bos taurus ) cDNA Dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) transcripts were identified and extracted from : http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / projects / mapview / map _ search . cgi ? taxid = 9913 & query = DNM 2 Sequences were then opened in BioEdit v7 . 0 . 5 . 3 and duplicate sequences were removed . Using PuTTY as a shell and Filezilla to move files a reference sequence for full - length Bos Taurus DNM2 gene was built ( Accession number : NM _ 001099369 . 1 ) , using python script ( see Appendix D ) . All cDNA transcript sequences were then aligned to reference sequence using SAMtools to create . sam files , which were subsequently converted to . bam files using BAMtools . These . bam files were then sorted and indexed before viewing the alignment on Intergrative Genomics Viewer ( IGV ) . cDNA transcript sequences accession numbers are listed in ( Chapter 4 , Table 4 . 1 ) . Sequence data generated to confirm KC Dynamin - 2 sequence was also processed and analysed using the same pipeline and packages as described above . Sequence analysis of BTV whole genome sequences were carried out using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor v7 . 2 . 5 . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 91 2 . 7 Flow Cytometry 2 . 7 . 1 Cell preparation Cells were treated with pharmacological inhibitors or transfected with DN proteins or siRNA as described in sections 2 . 5 . 13 or 2 . 5 . 14 or 2 . 9 . 1 and then infected as described in section 2 . 3 . 2 . Following infection , cells were stained with 1 μL of Near - IR Live / Dead stain ( Life technologies ) for 10 minutes at 37°C for BFA cells or 28°C for KC cells . Cells were then detached from the plastic either with Accutase ( Sigma ) for BFA cells or with serum free Schneiders media ( Sigma ) for KC cells . Following this , cells were transferred to a u - bottomed 96 - well plate ( Fischer Scientific ) and pelleted at 1000rpm ( 233 g ) for 3 minutes . Cells were fixed by resuspended in 4 % PFA ( Sigma ) for 1 hour before pelleting again at 1000rpm ( 233 g ) for 3 minutes and then resuspending in D - PBS ( Sigma ) . Infected cells were then labelled for BTV proteins ( see section 2 . 7 . 2 ) before analysing on the BD LSR Fortessa ( Becton Dickinson ) , laser configurations can be found in the appendices ( Appendix B ) . Cytometer Setup and Tracking ( C , S & T ) beads ( Becton Dickinson ) were used prior to every experiment to ascertain the cytometer’s initial baseline status ( to set laser delays ) and variation for each fluorescence detector , allowing algorithms to automatically determine PMT gains allowing application settings to be used and reproducibility between experiments . Compensation and cytometer laser setup / settings are shown in Appendix B . After data collection , data was analysed using FCS Express v5 ( De Novo ) and graphically represented using GraphPad Prism v6 with statistical analysis carried out in Minitab v16 . The gating strategy can be visualised in section 2 . 7 . 3 . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 92 2 . 7 . 2 Intracellular labelling of BTV infection for flow cytometry After fixation , cells were permeabilised with 150μL of 0 . 2 % Saponin ( Sigma ) in 1 % BSA ( Sigma ) in PBS ( Sigma ) , which will be referred to as ‘saponin block buffer’ throughout for 5 minutes . Cells were pelleted for 3 minutes at 1000rpm ( 233 g ) , resuspended in 50μL of primary antibody , Orbivirus reference antibody ( Orab ) 276 ( The Pirbright Institute ) which was raised in Rabbit ( IAH ) and diluted at 1 in 4000 ( determined by antibody titration , see Appendix C ) in saponin block buffer . This was the detected using goat anti - rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 ( Life Technologies ) secondary antibody used at 1 in 200 and incubated for 30 minutes . Antibody Orab276 was identified as detecting BTV VP5 , VP6 and VP7 in western blot ( see Appendix C ) . Orab 276 polyclonal serum had been previously raised against purified BTV1 in rabbits and the detection of structural proteins VP5 , VP7 and VP6 by this antibody was confirmed by western blot . Subsequently cells were pelleted for 3 minutes at 1000rpm ( 233 g ) and then resuspended with saponin block buffer and incubated with agitation for 5 minutes before pelleting for 3 minutes at 1000rpm ( 233 g ) . This step was repeated a further 2 times to remove unbound non - specific binding of primary antibody . Cells were then pelleted for 3 minutes at 1000rpm ( 233 g ) and incubating in 50μL secondary antibody , goat anti - rabbit alexa - fluor 647 ( Life Technologies ) diluted 1 in 200 in saponin block buffer for 30 minutes in the dark . Cells were washed three times in saponin block buffer as described and then resuspended in 350μL D - PBS and transferred to FACS tubes ( BD Biosciences ) for analysis on the LSR Fortessa ( BD Biosciences ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 93 2 . 7 . 3 Flow cytometry analysis Data collected on the BD LSR Fortessa using FacsDiva software was exported as flow cytometry standard ( FCS ) files . This data was analysed with Denovo , FCS Express v5 software . Cell populations were gated to isolate single , live cells for further analysis . Examples of gating strategies are shown in figures , which demonstrate the gating strategy for quantifying BTV infection in GFP - fusion protein transfections ( Figure 2 . 2 ) , quantifying control ligand uptake in GFP - fusion protein transfections ( Figure 2 . 3 ) , quantifying BTV infection in drug inhibitor experiments or siRNA transfected cells ( Figure 2 . 4 ) and quantifying control ligand uptake in drug inhibitor exposure or siRNA transfected cells ( Figure 2 . 5 ) . The percentage of cells labelled for viral proteins were used as a measure of BTV - 1 infection . The threshold for the detection of cells positive for viral proteins were set by using uninfected cells , which were treated in the same manner and labelled with the same primary and secondary antibodies used for detecting virus . The mean fluorescent intensity ( mfi ) was used as a measure for quantifying the uptake of control ligands in a cell population . The background threshold was set by using cells that were exposed to ligand but only at 4°C ( to prevent uptake of ligand ) as a baseline . Numerical data generated from analysis of flow cytometry data were then statistically analysed using Minitab v17 and graphically represented using GraphPad Prism v6 ( see section 2 . 10 ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 94 Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2 . 2 Gating strategy for detection of BTV infection in transfected cells Flow cytometry data was analysed using FCS Express v5 . Density plots were used to gate on single cells , gate 1 ( A ) , live cells , gate 2 ( B ) and BTV infection was detected in GFP positive and GFP negative cells by using the background control to set the background gate positions ( C ) . Panel ( D ) shows GFP - fusion protein transfected cells that have been infected as an example .

Cells were exposed to 0 . 12ug / mL of purified virus ( see section 2 . 3 . 2 ) for virus infection studies or 6ug / mL ( see section 2 . 3 . 4 ) for virus entry studies . Following infection or uptake studies , cells were placed on ice and fixed with 4 % PFA for 1 hour and then washing and replacing fixative with D - PBS . Internalized and replicating virus was detected using anti - BTV Orab276 ( The Pirbright Institute ) used at 1 in 1000 , which was raised in Rabbit ( IAH ) , and labeled with a goat anti - rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 ( Life Technologies ) secondary antibody used at 1 in 200 or anti - BTV antibody / Orab279 , raised in guinea pigs ( The Pirbright Institute ) used at 1 in 1000 and then detected with goat anti - guinea pig IgG Alexa Fluor 568 ( Life Technologies ) secondary antibody used at 1 in 200 . Infectious sub - viral particles ( ISVP’s ) were labelled with polyclonal rabbit serum Orab109 or 110 ( raised against purified BTV1 ISVPs ) used at 1 in 1000 and detected with goat anti - rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 ( Life Technologies ) secondary antibody used at 1 in 200 . All coverslips were stained with 4 ' , 6 - Diamidino - 2 - Phenylindole DAPI stain ( Life technologies ) at 1 in 10000 and virus uptake experiments were also stained with phalloidin - 488 ( Life technologies ) at 1 in 25 . Virus uptake or infection was visualized using the Leica SP2 Scanning Confocal Microscope or Leica TCS SP8 Confocal laser scanning Microscope . Virus uptake studies used the Hybrid 3 settings in order to detect low fluorescent single virions in the 552 laser channel and the 488 channel in order to not bleach phalloidin - 488 staining Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 100 2 . 8 . 2 Image analysis Z - stacked images were compiled , rendered , 3D - cell reconstructed and analysed using IMARIS image analysis software . 2 . 9 Biochemical Analysis 2 . 9 . 1 Pharmaceutical inhibitors Several pharmaceutical inhibitors were used throughout this thesis either to pre - treat cells for 30 minutes prior to infection / control ligand uptake or treat cells at time points post infection , which are specified in figure legends in results chapters .

Two control ligands were used in this thesis , which were transferrin , an established marker in mammalian cell systems for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( ( Harding et al . , 1983 , Harding and Stahl , 1983 , Hanover et al . , 1984 , Hopkins , 1985 , Hopkins et al . , 1985 ) ) and dextran , an established marker for fluid - phase uptake / macropinocytosis ( Klein and Satre , 1986 ) . Cells were serum starved for 45 minutes , with three washes with serum free media , Glasgow’s Minimum Essential Media ( GMEM ) ( Sigma ) , every 15 minutes . Cells were then exposed to 10μg / mL transferrin Alexa - Fluor 647 ( Life technologies ) or 0 . 5mg / mL dextran Alexa - Fluor 647 ( Life technologies ) for 15 minutes and then placed on ice . Cells were then processed for either flow cytometry ( see section 2 . 7 ) or confocal microscopy ( see section 2 . 8 ) . Control ligand described above was slightly adapted for fluid phase uptake / macropinocytosis stimulation experiment ( See Chapter 5 , section 5 . 5 . 7 ) . For this experiment , cells were serum starved as described above and then exposed to either 1μg / mL phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) ( Sigma ) or 0 . 3μg / mL purified BTV - 1 ( diluted in serum free GMEM ) for 15 minutes . After 15 minute stimulation , cells were then exposed to 0 . 5mg / mL dextran ( Life Technologies ) and were incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to allow ligands to be internalized . Cells were then placed on ice and prepared for flow cytometry ( see section 2 . 7 ) . Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 103 2 . 9 . 3 Cytotoxicity Assay Cells were seeded onto optically clear bottom , white - sided plates ( Perkin Elmer ) the day before the assay . When cells were 80 % confluent , cells were treated with a range of concentrations of the pharmacological inhibitors tested ( see section 2 . 9 . 1 ) . Cells were incubated with inhibitors for 12 . 5 hours . The cell titre substrate and buffer were then mixed after defrosting and equilibrating to room temperature and 100uL of the substrate / buffer mix were added to cells for 10 minutes , whilst being gently rocked . The luminescence of the cells , were then read using Hidex chameleon luminometer . Viability was determined by luminescence readings where high luminescence corresponds to healthy , viable cells and low luminescence corresponds to metabolically inactive cells ( i . e . cytotoxicity ) . 2 . 10 Statistical Analysis General Linear Model ( randomised factors – date of experiment , fixed factors being treatment ) ANOVA with Tukey’s correction was carried out for all flow cytometry data using Minitabv17 . Data from GFP - fusion transfection experiments were first normalised to account for transfection efficiency before then being analysed as described above . To do this , expressing populations ( GFP positive ) that were infected were normalised by dividing the total % cells of the total expressing population , this was repeated with the uninfected population and the same process was carried out with the non - expressing populations ( GFP negative ) . All experimental data was in triplicate with at least two repeated experiments . Data from repeated experiments were combined prior to statistical analysis . Flow cytometry data was graphically represented by presenting all experiment data as dot plots with each experiment identified by a different symbol and each treatment in different Chapter 2 : Understanding the early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 104 colours . The decision on the graphical representation was to openly show inherent variability between experiments but to also show that each experiment showed the same trend and indicated where possible if the trends were significant by the use of ‘ * ’ , where * is p = < 0 . 05 , * * is p = < 0 . 005 and * * * is p = < 0 . 0005 . Chapter 3 - Purification and characterisation of the adaptation of BTV to cell culture Chapter 3 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 105 3 . 1 Introduction Laboratory adaptation of viruses through multiple passaging in cell culture often results in viruses that are genetically and phenotypically different from the original field isolates ( Krug et al . , 2015 , Kaul et al . , 2009 , Roedig et al . , 2011 ) . It has been demonstrated that these adaptations can affect virus entry , as is seen with Foot - and - Mouth Disease Virus ( FMDV ) where cell culture adaptation alters virus - receptor interactions allowing the virus to enter and replicate in cells that were previously non - permissive to infection ( Berryman et al . , 2013 , Chamberlain et al . , 2015 , Jackson et al . , 1996 , Sa - Carvalho et al . , 1997 ) . Previous publications investigating BTV cell entry used highly mammalian cell culture adapted strains ( Forzan et al . , 2007 , Gold et al . , 2010 ) . This chapter investigates cell culture adaptation of a field isolate of BTV through serial passaging in mammalian and insect cell culture . The sequences of the viral genomes were determined and the effect on virus infectivity on mammalian and insect cells compared . In addition , a method of virus purification which requires minimal virus passaging without mammalian cell culture was developed by modifying a previously published BTV purification protocol ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) . For this study , a field isolate of BTV - 1 ( BTV - 1GIB2007 / 01 ) was used . This virus originated from a sheep in the Gibraltar outbreak ( which took place in 2007 ) and was isolated at the time by one passage in insect cells ( Culicoides spp . ( KC ) cells ) and stored in the BTV reference collection designated as BTV - 1GIB2007 / 01 without propagation in mammalian Chapter 3 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 106 cells . This chapter characterises the purified BTV particles using the modified protocol for insect cell generated BTV and investigates particle purity and viability . Previous BTV cell entry publications also used different virus preparations ; Forzan et al . , used non - purified virus in cell culture supernatant ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) , whereas Gold et al . , used purified virus ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . It is documented that cytokines , growth factors and other cellular factors can activate endocytosis pathways . For example , macropinocytosis can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases , transmembrane receptors that are activated by ligands such as growth factors , which can be found in tissue culture supernatants ( Maruyama , 2014 , Hubbard and Miller , 2007 , Bryant et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , certain cytokines can play a role in the activation ( IL - 4 and IL - 13 ) and suppression ( IL - 10 and IFN - γ ) of fluid - phase uptake in macrophages ( Montaner et al . , 1999 ) . It has also been observed that pro - inflammatory cytokines IL - 1 , IL - 6 and IL - 8 , are released from BTV infected endothelial cells and are known to modulate the course of BTV infection ( DeMaula et al . , 2002b ) . To avoid the potential influence of cellular factors on BTV entry the studies carried out in this thesis used purified virus . This chapter will describe purification and characterisation of whole virion particles of BTV - 1 ( BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 ) from KC cells and evaluate the significance of cell culture adaptation . Chapter 3 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 107 3 . 2 Phenotypic and genotypic effects of serial passaging of BTV - 1 3 . 2 . 1 Effects of serial passaging on BTV - 1 infectivity The field isolate of BTV - 1 ( BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 ) was initially passaged twice in KC cells ( KC2 ) and then a further 6 times in BHK - 21 ( KC2 / BHK6 ) or BFA cells ( KC2 / BFA6 ) , or a further four times in KC cells ( KC6 ) . Viruses from passages 2 ( KC2 ) and 6 ( KC6 , KC2 / BHK6 and KC2 / BFA6 ) for each cell line were analysed for infectivity . For each virus , infectivity was quantified using 3 cell lines ( KC , BHK and BFA cells ) using a fluorescent TCID 50 method ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 3 . 1 ) . For each virus / cell combination investigated the TCID 50 / mL were determined 3 times and carried out with a minimum of quadruple replicates . Figure 0 . 1 shows the titre for KC2 , KC6 , KC2 / BHK6 and KC2 / BFA6 viruses on all 3 cell lines . The virus generated from the second passage in KC cells ( KC2 ) was taken as the closest virus to the field isolate and this was compared to all other viruses . The first observation to note was a significant increase in viral titre in KC6 ( light blue bars in Figure 0 . 1 ) virus compared to KC2 virus ( dark blue bars in Figure 0 . 1 ) when titrated in KC cells ( ANOVA , p = 0 . 01 ) indicating that KC6 has enhanced infectivity in insect cells . Additionally , both KC cell derived viruses ( KC2 and KC6 ) had significantly lower infectivity on both mammalian cell lines ( BFA and BHK - 21 cells ) compared to the titre on KC cells ( KC2 viruses comparing titres observed in BFA and BHK - 21 cells , ANOVA p = 0 . 001 and p = 0 . 005 , respectively . KC6 viruses comparing to BFA and BHK - 21 cells , ANOVA p = < 0 . 0005 , p = < 0 . 0005 , respectively ) . This suggests that during passage Chapter 3 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 108 in KC cells , changes that might improve virus growth in mammalian cells are avoided and the virus retains its field - like phenotype . The results also demonstrate that the viruses ( KC2 / BFA6 and KC2 / BHK6 ) prepared using mammalian cells have similar titres on all 3 cell lines ( KC , BFA and BHK ) suggesting that passage through mammalian cells does result in adaptation to mammalian cell culture and enhanced replication in mammalian cell likes . Taken together these results suggest that to study entry of a virus with a field phenotype it should not be prepared using mammalian cells . Chapter 3 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 109 Figure 3 . 1 Figure 3 . 1 Infectivity of BTV - 1GIB2007 / 01 after serial passage in three different cell lines Field isolate BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 was serially passaged either in BHK - 21 , BFA or KC cells after two initial passages in KC cells . The second passage in KC cells ( KC2 ) and the sixth passaged virus from each cell line ( KC6 , KC2BHK6 and KC2BFA6 ) were titrated on each of the indicated cell lines . The TCID50 was determined 3 times and carried out with a minimum of quadruplet wells . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tukey’s correction was carried out to compare virus titre between viruses and both within and between cell lines . * = p < 0 . 05 , * * = p < 0 . 005 , * * * = p < 0 . 0005 , where bars indicate the viral titres which differ statistically significant Chapter 3 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 110 3 . 2 . 2 Effects of serial passaging of BTV - 1 in cell culture of genome sequence The whole genomes of the KC2 , KC6 and KC2BFA6 viruses were sequenced ( carried out in collaboration with Kyriaki Nomikou from the Arbovirus Molecular Research group at The Pirbright Institute ) and compared to identify sequence differences . For KC6 and KC2BFA6 , each segment was aligned against the corresponding segment from the KC2 virus to compare both nucleotide and amino acid sequences ( Alignments can be seen in Appendix E ) . Differences in the sequences are summarised in Table 3 . 1 . Synonymous nucleotide changes were seen in segments 1 and 6 when comparing KC2 virus with KC6 or KC2 / BFA6 viruses . Three non - synonymous nucleotide ( nt ) changes were detected in the KC6 virus compared to KC2 virus ; two in segment 9 and one in segment 3 which encode VP6 ( the viral helicase ) and VP3 ( the core scaffolding protein ) , respectively . These resulted in a Lysine ( K ) to Asparagine ( N ) ( changes at residue 184 in VP3 , and Arginine ( R ) to Glutamate ( E ) and Glycine ( G ) to Glutamate ( E ) changes at residues 24 and 121 in VP6 . One of the changes in segment 9 ( at nt 377 ) also alters residue 66 ( Glutamate ( E ) to Lysine ( K ) ) within NS4 as the reading frames for VP6 and NS4 overlap . The KC6 virus also had a major deletion ( 18 nt ; 1180 - 1197 ) in segment 2 resulting in the loss of 6 aa ( residue 388 - 393 ) in VP2 which as the outer most protein is the target for neutralising antibodies and responsible for cell - attachment . The KC2 / BFA6 virus had the same change in VP3 as seen in the KC6 virus and two other unique non - synonymous nucleotide changes ( compared to the KC2 virus ) . These were at nucleotide 1508 in segment 2 resulting in an Isoleucine ( I ) to Methionine ( M ) changes at residue 497 of VP2 , and at nucleotide 30 in segment 9 that resulted in an Isoleucine ( I ) to Methionine ( M ) change at residue 5 in VP6 .

Essentially , the virus was propagated by limited passage in KC cells and purifying virus directly from homogenised KC cells ( as Chapter 2 , section 2 . 2 ) . 3 . 3 . 1 Analysing BTV - 1 purity The purity of the virus preparations was assessed by SDS PAGE . SDS PAGE gels for one of the virus preparations are shown in Figure 3 . 2 and were stained with either Coomasie brilliant blue stain ( Figure 3 . 2 ( A ) ) or silver stain ( Figure 3 . 2 ( B ) ) . Three different volumes of the purified virus sample were analysed in lanes 1 ( 14µL of sample ) , lane 2 ( 7µL of sample ) and lane 3 ( 5µL of sample ) . All expected viral proteins were present in lanes 1 - 3 , with little to no cellular contamination ( Figure 3 . 2 ) .

Three volumes of purified virus from KC cells can be seen in Lanes 1 ( 14uL ) , 2 ( 7uL ) and 3 ( 5uL ) of both gels ( A ) and ( B ) . All major viral structural proteins can be identified in the silver stained PAGE ( B ) while cellular proteins cannot be detected . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 114 3 . 3 . 2 Analysing BTV - 1 infectivity The infectivity ( TCID 50 ) of the purified virus was determined by viral titration on KC , BFA and BHK - 21 ( Chapter 2 , section 2 . 3 . 1 ) . The mean TCID 50 / ml for 3 separate virus purifications is shown in Table 3 . 2 . The TCID 50 / ml on BFA and BHK - 21 cells were similar , however , the TCID 50 / mL were greater for all three , virus purifications on KC cells , a finding that is consistent with mammalian cell culture adapted BTV - 1 titrated on KC cells ( Mertens et al . , 1987 , Mertens et al . , 1996 ) ( see Table 3 . 2 ) . Table 3 . 2 Purified virus titres on three different cell lines Cell Line Mean TCID50 / mL Purification 1 Purification 2 Purification 3 KC 10 9 . 3 10 9 . 23 10 8 . 25 BFA 10 6 . 7 10 6 . 5 10 6 . 5 BHK - 21 10 7 10 6 . 6 n . d . 3 . 3 . 3 Aggregation of BTV - 1 virions Purified preparations of BTV have a tendency to aggregate which can be reduced by the addition of 0 . 1 % NLS ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) . Therefore purified viruses were stored in the presence of 0 . 1 % NLS . The aggregation status of the purified viruses was evaluated by DLS . Figure 3 . 3 shows DLS data for BTV - 1 whole virions and ISVPs from purification 3 . Previous publications suggest ISVPs are not prone to aggregation ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) and so purified ISVP was used as a marker for disaggregated virus . The trace identifies a heterogenous population of particle sizes , which are distributed between 40nm and 800nm for whole virus and 45nm and 1100nm for ISVPs ( Figure 3 . 3 ( A ) ) . In the whole virus trace , Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 115 a shoulder can be seen ( red trace panel ( a ) ) , which appears to peak at 70 - 90nm , consistent with the presence of individual virions . The main peak can be seen at approximately 250nm , suggestive of some virus aggregation , which potentially indicates that virus is in small aggregates of approximately 3 virions . The main peak for ISVPs ( green trace , panel ( a ) ) , however , is approximately 150nm , which could indicate small aggregates , consistent with 2 virions . For comparison , panel ( b ) shows virus that was stored at 4°C for 12 months and appears to show extensive virus aggregation , with two peaks shown at 150nm and 1050nm . As virus aggregates over time , freshly purified virus was used for all subsequent virus entry experiments . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 116 Figure 3 . 3 Figure 3 . 3 Dynamic Light Scattering of freshly purified BTV - 1 whole virions , ISVP’s and 1 year old purified BTV - 1 whole virions . Particle size was measured using the Malvern µ zetasizer of freshly purified BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 whole virions ( shown in red ) and ISVP’s ( shown in green ) as shown in figure ( A ) and compared to purified BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 whole virions that have been stored at 4°C for one year , as shown in figure ( B ) . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 117 3 . 3 . 4 Analysing whole genome sequencing of purified BTV In section 3 . 3 . 2 , a number of genomic changes were identified upon repeated passage of BTV in cell culture . The aim of this project is to purify BTV whilst retaining genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of the field isolate . Therefore , whole genome sequencing was carried out on low KC passaged purified virus and compared to the KC2 virus in order to identify whether any genetic changes have occurred prior to virus purification . After alignment of all BTV segments from purified virus with the KC2 virus sequence , it was identified that only a single polymorphic site in segment 9 at nucleotide position 17 was detected ( see Appendix F ) . As this was consensus sequencing , the site coded in the majority of the population for a G ( 75 % population ) but 25 % of the population coded for T . This change altered the amino acid from Methionine ( M ) to Arginine ( R ) . As this site was in the helicase , it is unlikely this mutation would impact cell entry . 3 . 4 Quantifying BTV - 1 infection using flow cytometry A method was developed to quantify BTV infection using flow cytometry . A number of available antibodies ( produced at TPI ) were screened for their suitability to identify infected cells . All of the antibodies tested detected viral proteins in BFA cells , compared to a low background signal seen in the uninfected controls or with infected cells incubated with only the secondary antibodies ( no first antibody controls ) ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . The polyclonal antibody orab276 ( raised in rabbit against BTV - 1 whole virus ) gave the best signal to background ratio ( Figure 3 . 4 ) and was therefore selected for BTV viral protein detection analysed by flow cytometry . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 118 Figure 3 . 4 Figure 3 . 4 Testing anti - BTV - 1 antibodies that quantify infection in flow cytometry and confocal applications Anti - BTV antibodies were tested in infected and uninfected BFA cells for their suitability for detecting BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 infection by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy . ( A ) BTV infection was detected using flow cytometry following 12h . p . i . All antibodies tested detected viral infection by flow cytometry , with little background seen in uninfected cells , antibodies Orab276 , Orab 277 and Orab 114 were tested . Panel ( B ) shows confocal microscopy of anti - BTV antibody Orab276 labelling on uninfected cells . Panel ( C ) shows anti - BTV antibody Orab276 tested on 18h infected cells . Panel ( D ) shows anti - BTV antibody Orab114 tested on 18h infected cells . Panel ( E ) shows anti - BTV antibody Orab277 tested on cells 18h infected cells . All confocal images show blue staining which is DAPI and red staining which is BTV . Scale bars = 15 µM . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 119 The same antibodies were also tested for their ability to detect infection by confocal microscopy ( Figure 3 . 4 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) ) . The antibodies generated good fluorescent intensity with little to no non - specific background binding . The level of infection observed using confocal microscopy , agreed with what was shown using flow cytometry , which gave confidence that flow cytometry would be a good quantitative technique to measure BTV infection . To determine the specificity and sensitivity of the flow cytometry assay for detecting BTV infection , BFA cells were infected with different amounts of virus ( Figure 3 . 5 ( A ) ) and left for 1 or 16 hours for each virus dilution . A small percentage ( < 2 % ) of cells were detected as positive for viral protein labelling above background when the cells were labelled 1 hour post infection presumably as the result of detecting input virus inoculum . However , after 16 hours of infection 5 - 28 % of the cell population was positive for viral proteins , indicating that the antibody is detecting active BTV - 1 infection ( Figure 3 . 5 ( A ) ) . Figure 3 . 5 ( B ) shows an infection time course to evaluate the ability of the antibody to detect virus infection in KC cells ( Figure 3 . 5 ( B ) ) . Cells were BTV - 1 infected and incubated for 1 , 16 , 20 and 24 hours before being processed for flow cytometry ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 ) . An increase in infection can be seen in KC cells as the length of infection increases ( Figure 3 . 5 ( B ) ) , indicating that the antibody used for detection of infection is both specific and sensitive for detecting viral protein generation during virus replication in both BFA and KC cells . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 120 Figure 3 . 5 Figure 3 . 5 Quantifying BTV - 1 infection using flow cytometry BTV - 1 infection was detected using anti - BTV antibody ( Orab276 ) and secondary goat - anti rabbit AlexaFluor - 647 . Panel ( A ) shows BFA cells infected with a dilution series of BTV - 1 and details viral protein expression levels at 1 and 16 hours post infection . Panel ( B ) shows KC cells infected with BTV - 1 ( 1 in 500 dilution ) and a time course of infection from 1 to 24 hours post infection . Graph displays raw data . Single , live cell populations were analysed . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 121 3 . 5 Discussion Serial passaging of viruses at low multiplicity of infection ( m . o . i . ) in cell culture effectively forces viruses to pass through repeated evolutionary bottlenecks , which in turn can significantly impact the genetic landscape of the virus ( Woo and Reifman , 2014 ) . This can force viruses to adapt to the cellular environment to improve virus growth . Significantly , this can result in virus with altered receptor preferences , which could change the endocytosis pathway used for entry . Furthermore , viruses passaged at high m . o . i . introduce a larger viral diversity in the virus population after each passage ( Domingo et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , this may cause viruses at the undetectable sub - consensus level to become detectable after repeated passaging , if selective pressures allow it to become a dominant virus sequence in the population . This chapter describes the effects of serial passage on BTV infectivity and genome sequence during passage of a field isolate of BTV in mammalian and insect cells . A field isolate of BTV was passed 6 times through KC cells ( KC6 ) or twice through KC cells followed by a further 6 passages through BFA or BHK cells ( KC2 / BFA6 and KC2 / BHK6 , respectively ) . The infectivity of the KC2 , KC6 , KC2 / BFA6 and KC2 / BHK6 viruses for KC , BFA or BHK - 21 cells show that the KC6 virus appears to have higher infectivity for KC cells than the KC2 virus . Sequences of these viruses identified amino acid changes in the viral helicase ( VP6 ) , core protein ( VP3 ) and NS4 . Interestingly , the KC6 virus also had a major deletion in the cell attachment protein ( VP2 ) . It is not known if any of the changes result in improved growth in KC cells or if some of the changes are required in combination and so further work will be needed to determine the effects of these changes on virus growth in KC cells . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 122 The results of this analysis also show that the viruses passaged in KC cells have a lower titre for mammalian cells , suggesting that virus propagation in KC cells avoids changes associated with adaptation to growth in mammalian cell culture . This conclusion was supported by the observation that the viruses passaged in mammalian cells ( KC2 / BFA6 and KC2 / BHK6 ) had higher titres on mammalian cells compared to the KC2 virus , suggesting adaptation had occurred . Sequences of the KC2 / BFA6 virus identified changes that could account for improved growth in mammalian cells but as stated above confirmation of this will require future work . All viruses had relatively high infectious titres in midge cells . This suggests that replication of BTV in midge cells is robust and that genetic changes driven by selective pressure within mammalian cells may not impede infection in Culicoides spp . derived KC cells . It is possible that this is a viral survival strategy that has evolved to allow the virus to continue to replicate successfully in the vector . VP2 is the cell attachment protein . The virus KC6 has a deletion of 6 amino acids ( aa ) ( residues 388 – 393 ) in VP2 , which does not appear in the KC2 / BFA6 virus . This deletion could influence the functionality of the attachment protein , such as altering receptor binding and attachment of entry . Furthermore , the KC2 / BFA6 also had a non - synonymous nucleotide change in VP2 ( I497M ) , which could influence virus entry . The fact that a reduction in viral titre is observed in the KC6 virus in BFA cells , could suggest that this deletion may alter receptor - binding preference at the point of attachment , perhaps to Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 123 enhance receptor binding in insect cells by removing a less efficient binding site in the virus . It is known that the RGD tripeptide in VP7 can mediate binding to integrins and attachment to Culicoides spp . cells ( Tan et al . , 2001 ) and so this deletion may alter conformation of VP2 and may expose the RGD peptide to allow binding through that site . However , to confirm this hypothesis , further functional analysis of this virus is required . Consensus sequencing identifies the dominant sequence in a population . However , in virus population ( particularly RNA viruses ) , large viral diversities can exist . Therefore , when carrying out consensus sequencing in BTV population , the consensus sequence usually reflect a change in the dominant virus sequence in the population ( Domingo et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore changes in the dominant sequence , may reflect selective pressure allowing for cell culture adaptation . Whilst changes in sequences will be described as ‘synonymous’ or ‘non - synonymous changes’ from this point forward , it may be reflective in a change in viral sequence dominance due to selection or a polymorphic site due to adaptation . Deep sequencing would reveal which possibility is likely . Interestingly , there were two changes in the same position identified in both the KC6 and the KC2 / BFA6 viruses , one of which was non - synonymous . The synonymous substitution resided in VP1 , G to A at bp position 3497 , and the non - synonymous substitution was identified in VP3 , K184N . As the same changes were identified in both the KC and BFA passaged viruses , these residues could indicate a general cell culture adaptation . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 124 Two additional non - synonymous mutations were observed in the KC6 virus within VP6 ( segment 9 ) , R24E and G121E , the viral helicase and a further mutation in the second open reading frame of segment 9 , which codes for NS4 , E66K . In addition , another non - synonymous substitution was also observed in VP6 of the KC2 / BFA6 virus , I5M . Non - synonymous substitutions within viral proteins such as the viral helicase and non - structural proteins in both of these viruses could influence viral replication . In addition , non - synonymous mutations in the attachment protein could possibly affect virus cell attachment and / or entry . It is interesting that there is a shared non - synonymous mutation in the VP3 of both cell culture passaged viruses , a core scaffold protein , the significance of which is difficult to determine without further investigation . Whilst it is unclear from this study whether the mutations identified in this chapter observed in serial passaged viruses would be recurrent , it does demonstrate that serial passaging of BTV in cell culture can influence the viral genome sequence , which then might affect viral cell entry and / or replication . Similar observations have been made in other studies where serial passaged viruses have shown polymorphic variation such as that seen in SARS coronavirus , Ebola , HIV - 1 , Hepatitis C , Rotavirus and FMDV some of which have also reported functional effects on the virus ( Agrawal - Gamse et al . , 2009 , Pugach et al . , 2004 , Volchkova et al . , 2011 , Poon et al . , 2005 , Mohan and Atreya , 2001 , Helle et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , it is important for studies that require purified virus to use a purification method , which retains a viral genome with close sequence identity to that of the original seed virus . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 125 Previous studies into BTV endocytosis have used laboratory adapted strains that have undergone multiple passages in mammalian cell culture , such as the BTV - 1 rSArrrr / 01 strain which has undergone serial passaging in BHK - 21 cells ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) and BTV - 10 strain which has undergone serial passage in BSR cells ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . Preservation of wild - type virus - host dynamics is important when studying cell entry of viruses as adaptation for the utilization of alternative receptors and / or endocytosis mechanisms is possible . In the case of arboviruses , such as BTV , serial passaging in mammalian cell culture could potentially adapt the virus to the mammalian cell type and could lose the natural vector - host dynamic . Studies of virus endocytosis often require high titre purified viruses in order to conduct cell - based assays . Purification of the virus is needed to allow confidence that the endocytosis mechanism being used is that which is triggered by the virus itself and not by cytokines or cellular growth factors ( Hubbard and Miller , 2007 , Maruyama , 2014 , Bryant et al . , 2007 ) . Adaptation of the Mertens et al ( 1987 ) protocol by replacement of BHK - 21 cells for propagating the virus to KC cells , a Culicoides spp . cell line , meant that a number of adaptations to the purification procedure were required to grow virus , confirm growth of the virus and lysis of the virus from these cells which become persistently infected with BTV . Analysis of the purity and infectivity of virus purified from KC cells revealed that the adaptation to the purification was successful . Furthermore , sequencing of the purified virus identified only a single polymorphic site in segment 9 ( VP6 - helicase ) of the genome . Indicating that , any adaptation of the purified virus has not resulted in adaptations that could impact BTV cell entry . The results show that the purification of the field isolate virus generated in KC cells was successful . Chapter 3 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 126 It has been documented that BTV often has a tendency to aggregate after purification , except in the presence of 0 . 1 % N - Lauoryl sarcosine ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) . This study showed that whilst particles consistent with the size of single virions could be observed in the purified samples of whole virions and ISVPs , sizes which correlate to both doublet and triplet cells could also be identified . This was demonstrated by dynamic light scattering of the sample which identified a heterogenous sized virus population and singlets , doublets and also triplets of the sample and this could also be seen when looking at transmission electron micrographs of the purified virus particles ( not shown ) . The DLS analysis also showed that purified virus stocks could not be stored for prolonged periods . Virus entry studies requires freshly purified virus . In order to characterise both viral growth and endocytosis mechanisms used by BTV , a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify viral infection in both BFA and KC cells . In summary , this chapter has described that BTV can successfully be purified from KC cells with limited adaptation to cell culture and retains both genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of field isolate BTV . Furthermore , development of a flow cytometry assay was successful and can be used to quantify BTV infection for aid of study BTV endocytosis . Chapter 4 - The role of dynamin in BTV entry and infection Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 128 4 . 1 Introduction The molecular mechanisms , which govern BTV entry into cells remain largely unknown . Only two studies have specifically investigated cell entry of BTV and both used cell culture adapted strains of the virus and cell lines derived from animals not normally targeted by BTV ( Gold et al . , 2010 , Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . In one of these studies , dynamin was implicated as being required for BTV cell entry ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . Dynamin is a GTPase known to act as a vesicle scission protein in many endocytosis pathways and is believed to exist as at least four splice variants ( Cao et al . , 2007 , Cao et al . , 1998 ) ( see Chapter 1 , section 1 . 12 ) . ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) showed that a pharmacological inhibitor ( Dynasore™ ) of dynamin inhibited BTV entry suggesting a role for dynamin in the entry process . In contrast , the same study showed that transient expression of DN dynamin - 2 ( the aa splice variant ) did not inhibit BTV entry or infection ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) which appears to contradict the results obtained by Dynasore . The main aim of this chapter is to investigate whether there is a role for dynamin in infection of host derived cells ( bovine endothelial ( BFA ) cells and Culicoides spp . ( KC ) cells ) by a field isolate of BTV - 1 and whether different dynamin - 2 splice variants play different roles in infection . The role of dynamin in BTV entry and infection was investigated using three different approaches . The first used pharmacological inhibitors of dynamin . The second utilised siRNA to selectively deplete cells of Dynamin - 2 while the third , was to investigate the role Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 129 of different dynamin - 2 splice variants in BTV infection by using over expression of DN dynamin - 2 splice variants : aa , ba and bb ( see Chapter1 , section 1 . 12 ) . At the start of this study , the Culicoides spp . genome was not available . Therefore , siRNA could not be used to target the Dynamin - 2 gene , nor could splice variants be identified in the insect host . Consequently , pharmacological inhibitors of dynamin alone were used to investigate the role of dynamin in the Culicoides spp . host . 4 . 2 The effects of Dynamin inhibitors on BTV entry and infection in BFA cells Dynamin is a large GTPase and acts as a scission protein that facilitates release of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 , McNiven et al . , 2000a ) . The conundrum that Dynasore ( a dynamin inhibitor ) but not DN dynamin - 2 aa inhibited BTV entry ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) prompted further investigation into the role of dynamin in BTV infection . 4 . 2 . 1 Toxicity of dynamin inhibitors for BFA cells Many endocytosis inhibitors can cause cellular toxicity ( Vercauteren et al . , 2010 ) . To establish if dynamin inhibitors are toxic for BFA cells , the cells were incubated for 12 . 5 hours with different concentrations of the inhibitors and cell viability determined using Promega Cell ToxGlo assay , which quantifies cellular ATPase activity within cells . Reductions in cellular ATPase readings correlates to high cellular toxicity and therefore , the Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 130 toxic effects of pharmacological inhibitors on the cell lines of interest could be measured ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 9 . 3 ) . Initially four dynamin inhibitors ; Dynasore™ , Dyngo - 4a™ , MiTMAB™ and Dynole 34 - 2™ were screened for toxicity over 12 . 5 hours . All four dynamin inhibitors displayed cytotoxic effects when cells were exposed to high concentrations of drug ( Figure 4 . 1 ) . Three of the four inhibitors appeared to not affect cellular ATPase activity at concentrations reported to give effective dynamin inhibiton in other cell lines ( Robertson et al . , 2014 , Gold et al . , 2010 , Forzan et al . , 2007 , Berryman et al . , 2005 , Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 131 Figure 4 . 1 Figure 4 . 1 Toxicity of Dynamin drug inhibitors on BFA cells Cellular ATPase activity was measured using a luminescent assay in BFA cells treated with different concentrations each carried out in triplicate of one of four dynamin inhibitors for the duration of 12 . 5 hours . Panel ( A ) displays toxicity data for cells treated with increasing concentrati ons of Dyngo4a , panel ( B ) shows toxicity data for cells treated with increasing concentrations of Dynasore , panel ( C ) shows toxicity data for cells treated with different concentrations of Dynole 34 - 2 and lastly toxicity data for BFA cells treated with multiple concentrations of MiTMAB can be seen in panel ( D ) . Untreated cells are displayed in red and drug treated cells are displayed in blue . Dynole 34 - 2 and MITMAB have the highest toxicity . A B C D Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 132 Dynasore showed a maximum non - toxic concentration of 100µM ( Figure 4 . 1 B ) , for Dyngo4a the maximum non - toxic concentration was 120µM ( Figure 4 . 1 A ) and for Dynole 34 - 2 it was 40µM ( Figure 4 . 1 C ) . MiTMAB displayed high toxicity to BFA cells and the maximum non - toxic concentration was only 8µM . As MiTMAB is reported to be an effective dynamin inhibitor at 32µM , this was not included in further studies ( Figure 4 . 1 D ) . Dyngo4a exhibited the least cytotoxic effects on BFA cells and was selected for further studies at a concentration of 30µM . Initial viability assays using ToxGlo indicated Dynasore ( 100μM ) and Dynole 34 - 2 ( 40μM ) appeared to not effect cellular ATPase activity at concentrations , which have been reported by others to effectively inhibit dynamin ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . However , when cells were treated with 100µM Dynasore or 40µM Dynole 34 - 2 ( but not Dyngo - 4a ) , the live / dead amine reactive stain used for flow cytometry assays identified cells as non - viable after 12 . 5 hours ( data not shown ) , which was an observation consistent with what was seen by Gold in BHK - 21 cells ( Gold , 2010 ) . Therefore , Dyngo - 4a™ was selected as the pharmacological inhibitor of choice to use for all subsequent experiments on BFA cells . 4 . 2 . 2 Effects of dynamin inhibitor Dyngo - 4a on BTV - 1 infection of BFA cells The inhibitory activity of Dyngo - 4a™ towards dynamin was further investigated in BFA cells . BFA cells were pre - treated with Dyngo - 4a™ and incubated with AlexaFluor - 647 conjugated transferrin ( see Chapter 2 , sections 2 . 9 . 1 / 2 . 7 . 1 / 2 . 7 . 3 ) , as transferrin is known to enter cells via the dynamin - dependent endocytosis pathway of CME ( see Chapter 1 , section 1 . 11 . 1 ) . This pathway should be disrupted if dynamin is successfully inhibited . Upon treatment with Dyngo - 4a™ ( 30µM ) BFA cells displayed a statistically significant reduction in transferrin Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 133 uptake ( Figure 4 . 2 A ) compared to control treated cells ( i . e . cells treated with the equivalent drug diluent ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 9 . 1 , Table 2 . 2 ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 134 A B Figure 4 . 2 The effects of Dyngo4a on control ligand uptake and BTV infection BFA cells were treated with either 30µM Dyngo4a or an equivalent dilution of the drug diluent DMSO either 30 minutes before transferrin uptake or before infection or after infection was initiated ( 1 , 2 , 3 or 6 hours post infection ) . Empty symbols indicate experiment 1 with 3 replicates and solid symbols indicate experiment 2 with 3 replicates . Panel ( A ) shows the effects of Dyngo4a on transferrin , uptake . BFA cells pre - treated with Dyngo4a exhibit a significant inhibition of transferrin uptake compared to both the drug diluent control and untreated cells ( One - way ANOVA , tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 005 , p = < 0 . 005 , respectively ) . Panel ( B ) shows the effect of Dyngo4a on BTV infection . Inhibition of infection was seen in cells treated with Dyngo4a pre - infection ( One - Way ANOVA p = < 0 . 005 ) but not when added after the start of infection . Figure 4 . 2 Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 135 BFA cells were also pre - treated with 30µM Dyngo - 4a™ and infected with BTV or treated with Dyngo - 4a™ at certain time points post infection . BFA cells pre - treated with Dyngo - 4a™ showed a significant inhibition of infection compared to the control treatment , which is a dilution of the drug diluent equivalent to the drug concentration ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 9 . 1 ) ( One - way ANOVA , Tukey’s correction p = < 0 . 005 ) but no inhibition of infection was observed in cells treated at 1 , 2 , 3 or 6 hours post infection ( Figure 4 . 2 B ) suggesting a role for dynamin during cell entry . As Dyngo - 4a™ caused an inhibition of BTV infection only when added prior to infection , the role of dynamin during BTV entry was further explored . BFA cells were seeded on to coverslips and either treated with Dyngo - 4a™ or control treatment ( DMSO ) before incubation with BTV at 4°C for 1 hour to allow virus to adsorb , after 3 washes with cell culture media , cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C to allow virus internalisation . Cells were then fixed and labelled for BTV proteins ( red ) using appropriate antibodies ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 8 . 1 ) . The actin cytoskeleton ( green ) was stained with Alexa - Fluor488 labelled phalloidin and fluorescence detected using confocal microscopy ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 8 . 1 ) . On the figure the green intensity was set to show the actin rich cortex that lies just deep of the plasma membrane to help identified internalised virus . Panel ( A ) ( Figure 4 . 3 ) show uninfected control cells labelled in the absence of BTV and panel ( B ) shows infected cells labelled with secondary antibody only to demonstrate that no non - specific fluorescent labelling using Orab 276 polycolonal anti - BTV1 serum or secondary antibody can be detected . Panels ( C ) , ( E ) and ( G ) show control treated ( drug diluent , see Chapter 2 , section , 2 . 9 . 1 , Table 2 . 2 ) cells after 2 hours post virus entry and viral protein labelling can be seen within the cytosol . Additionally , panels ( D ) , ( F ) and ( H ) show cells pre - Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 136 treated with Dyngo4a for 30 minutes and viral proteins can be seen remaining at the cell surface after 2 hours of uptake ( Figure 4 . 3 ) Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 137 Figure 4 . 3 Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 138 4 . 3 The effect of siRNA targeting dynamin - 2 on BTV infection Dynamin inhibitors target all isoforms of dynamin ; dynamin - 1 , dynamin - 2 and dynamin - 3 . Dynamin - 2 is ubiquitously expressed in all cells , whereas dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 3 have tissue specific expression ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) ( see Chapter 1 , section 1 . 12 ) . Therefore , for BFA cells it was likely that the isoform dynamin - 2 would be involved in BTV endocytosis . Consequently , siRNA targeting bovine dynamin - 2 was designed and the effect of dynamin - 2 depletion on BTV infection investigated . 4 . 3 . 1 Effects of dynamin - 2 targeting siRNA on BTV - 1 infection of BFA cells Initially , transfection of siRNA into BFA cells was optimised through testing of different ratios of transfection reagent to a fluorescently tagged control siRNA ( called siGlo - green™ ) at different cell densities for 24 and / or 48 hours before fixing the cells and quantifying transfection efficiency by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy . Increasing numbers of transfected cells were observed as the ratio of transfection reagent to siRNA increased , while cell density showed little effect on transfection efficiency ( Figure 4 . 4 A and B ) . Analysing transfected cells by confocal microscopy , it was observed that by 48 hours and using 1μL transfection reagent to ( 20pmol ) siRNA , nearly all cells were transfected and began to show nuclear localisation of the siRNA ( Figure 4 . 4 C - H ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 140 Figure 4 . 4 Optimisation of siRNA transfections in BFA cells using the siGlo control BFA cells were transfected with 5μM of a fluorescently tagged siRNA known as siGlo in combination with 4 concentrations of the transfection reagent ( Dharmafect ) for 24 or 48h . Transfection efficiency was quantified using flow cytometry and cellular location of transfected siRNA was observed using confocal microscopy . Panel ( A ) shows transfection efficiency quantified using flow cytometry on BFA cells that were 80 % confluent . Transfection efficiency shows a steady increase in efficiency from low concentrations of the transfection reagent to high concentrations . A similar trend is also observed in panel ( B ) , which shows the transfection efficiency in BFA cells that were 50 % confluent . Little difference in transfection efficiency is observed for cells that were 80 or 50 % confluent . Mock transfected cells were treated in the same manner with transfection reagent minus siGlo . Panels ( C - H ) shows confocal images of cells transfected with siGlo ( 24h transfections are seen in Panels C , Dharmafect at 0 . 25μL ( scale bar = 14μM ) , E , Dharmafect at 0 . 5μL ( scale bar = 22μM ) and G , Dharmafect at 1μL ( scale bar = 22μM ) ) or 48h transfections ( Panels D , 0 . 25μL Dharmafect ( scale bar = 22μM ) , F , 0 . 5μL Dharmafect ( scale bar = 15μM ) and H , 1μL Dharmafect ( scale bar 21μM ) ) . Again an increase in transfection efficiency is observed in cells transfected using a high concentration of the transfection reagent ‘Dharmafect’ . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 141 siGlo is shown to target the nucleus in cells transfected for 48h using 1μL of Dharmafect ( panel H ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 142 In order to confirm that neither the transfection reagent nor the siRNA itself was causing cellular toxicity , live cells were distinguished by adding a live / dead stain , followed by quantification of live cells using flow cytometry . Untreated cells were compared to mock transfected cells ( which were exposed to transfection reagent ) and it was identified that transfection reagent alone had no significant impact on cell viability after a 12 hour incubation with the reagent . However , mean 27 . 3 % ( ± 9 . 87 Standard Deviation ) reduction in cell viability was observed in cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA , while , transfected fluorescently tagged siRNA ( siGlo ) had no impact on cell viability ( Figure 4 . 5 ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 143 Figure 4 . 5 1 5 0 1 0 0 5 0 0 Figure 4 . 5 The effects of siRNA transfection on cell viability Cells were either transfected with scrambled siRNA or SiGlo for 48h , treated with transfection reagent or left untreated . Cells were then labelled with a Live / Dead cell viability stain before quantifying the proportion of live cells using flow cytometry . Little negative effect was observed in cell viability under any conditions except in cells that were transfected with scrambled siRNA 141 , which showed a mean 27 . 3 % ( ± 9 . 87 Standard Deviation ) reduction in cell viability . % N o r m a li s e d L i v e C e ll s Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 144 Two siRNA’s designed to target bovine dynamin - 2 were named siRNA 141 and 657 , respective of the nt position on the dynamin - 2 sequence that they target . Both siRNAs also had a scrambled counterpart to use as control siRNAs , which were named scrambled 141 and 657 . Three separate siRNA experiments were carried out and the effect on BTV infection , transferrin uptake and Dynamin - 2 protein production were investigated . BFA cells were transfected for 48 hours and cell lysates were quantified for total protein content and 18µg of protein analysed for each sample by western blot for dynamin - 2 presence . Actin was visualised within the same samples on the same blot to act as a loading control ; the western blot from siRNA experiment 3 is shown in Figure 4 . 6 ( A ) . Densitometry was carried out on quantify detected protein expression by western blot . Background levels ( an area of blank film ) were subtracted and dynamin protein levels normalised against the internal actin loading control for each sample , mock control treatment was taken as 1 and ech treatment as a proportion of the mock control treatment . Normalised densitometry data is presented in Figure 4 . 6 ( B ) . The dynamin antibody identified 2 different size proteins by the western blot and they were analysed and quantified separately . Comparing scrambled controls with the paired siRNA , it was identified that there was little difference in Dynamin - 2 production in scrambled 141 ( Figure 4 . 4A Lane 2 ) compared with siRNA 141 ( Lane 7 ) . A reduction in dynamin protein was seen for siRNA 657 ( Lane 8 ) compared to scrambled 657 ( Lane 3 ) . In addition , double transfected samples containing 20pmol of each siRNA ( Lane 9 ) and another sample containing 10pmol of each siRNA ( Lane 10 ) also observed a reduction in dynamin compared to the double transfected scrambled 20pmol control ( Lane 4 ) . Statistical analysis could not be carried out due to limited sample number but the trends indicate that there was a reduction in Dynamin - 2 production in 3 out of the 4 transfection conditions ( siRNA 657 and the two double transfected siRNA 141 and 657 at concentration 20pmol and 10pmol ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 145 The effect of dynamin - 2 depletion on BTV infection was also analysed for all three experiments using flow cytometry and the results are shown in ( Figure 4 . 7 A ) . Statistically significant inhibition in infection was observed for 3 out of 4 siRNA combinations compared with the paired scrambled control and the reduction of infectivity coincided with those transfections conditions , which had also resulted in successful reduction in Dynamin - 2 . These were siRNA 657 compared to scrambled 657 ( One - way ANOVA , tukey’s correction p = < 0 . 005 ) and the double transfected siRNA’s 141 and 657 at both concentrations ( 20pmol each and 10pmol each ) compared to the scrambled controls ( One - way ANOVA , tukey’s correction p = < 0 . 0005 and p = < 0 . 0005 , respectively ) .

Cells were then infected with BTV for 12h . Cells were fixed and then analysed for BTV viral protein expression using flow cytometry . The graph shows the effect of siRNA on BTV infection from 3 experiments , empty symbols represent experiment 1 , solid symbols represent experiment 2 and half - filled symbols are from experiment 3 . Statistically significant reductions in BTV infection are seen in cells treated with siRNA 657 ( p = < 0 . 005 ) compared to scrambled 657 control , cells double transfected with siRNA 141 and 657 at double concentration ( 20pmol + 20pmol ) displayed a significant decrease in infection compared to corresponding scrambled control ( p = < 0 . 0005 ) and in addition to single concentration siRNA and scrambled siRNA ( 10pmol + 10pmol ) ( p = < 0 . 005 ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 150 4 . 4 The role of dynamin - 2 splice variants in BTV infection Alternate splicing of dynamin - 2 has been reported to exist ( Cao et al . , 1998 , Cao et al . , 2007 ) . In the rat genome , it has been confirmed that four splice variants exist called dynamin - 2 aa , bb , ba and ab . Next , the role of different dynamin - 2 splice variants in BTV infection was investigated by transiently expression of dominant negative mutants of dynamin - 2 splice variants ( aa , bb and ba ) and determining the effect on BTV infection 4 . 4 . 1 Effects of dynamin - 2 splice variants on positive control ligand uptake in BFA cells The effects of transient expression of GFP - tagged , WT and DN dynamin - 2 splice variants ( aa , ba and bb ) on endocytosis was investigated using BFA cells and Alexa - Fluor - 647 labelled transferrin ( a marker of CME ) ( Harding et al . , 1983 , Harding and Stahl , 1983 , Hanover et al . , 1984 , Hopkins et al . , 1985 ) and Alexa - Fluor - 647 labelled dextran ( a marker of fluid phase uptake / macropinocytosis ) ( Oliver et al . , 1984 ) . BFA cells were transfected for 12 hours . The cells were then serum starved and allowed to internalise transferrin or dextran for 15 minutes , followed by staining with live / dead stain , fixation ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 . 3 ) and analysis using flow cytometry . For each splice variant , two independent experiments were carried each in triplicate ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . For each transfection GFP positive ( expressers ) and GFP negative ( non - expressers ) populations were analysed separately . The data shown in ( Figure 4 . 8 ) compares transferrin / dextran uptake for WT and DN dynamin - 2 for the GFP positive populations . Expression of dominant - negative dynamin - 2 aa and bb resulted in an inhibition of transferrin uptake compared to cells expressing the corresponding WT Dynamin - 2 ( Figure 4 . 8 panels A and C ) . In contrast , the DN dynamin - 2 ba splice did not inhibit transferrin uptake and an increase in transferrin uptake compared to wild - type expressers was seen ( Figure 4 . 8 E ) . None of the dominant - negative splice variants ( aa , bb and ba ) affected dextran uptake ( Figure 4 . 8 B , D and F ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 151 Figure 4 . 8 Figure 4 . 8 The effect of DN dynamin - 2 splice variants on transferrin and dextran uptake Each dynamin - 2 splice variant was transfected into BFA cells and their effect on transferrin and ligand uptake were evaluated . Data is from two independent experiments carried out in triplicate . Empty symbols refer to data from experiment 1 and solid symbols refer to data from experiment 2 . Blue symbols indicate WT - dynamin - 2 expressing populations and red symbols reflect DN Dynamin - 2 Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 152 expressing populations . The effect of DN Dynamin - 2 aa expression on transferrin uptake can be seen in panel ( A ) . The effect of DN Dynamin - 2 aa expression on dextran uptake can be seen in panel ( B ) . DN Dynamin - 2 bb effect on transferrin uptake can be seen in panel ( C ) . Dextran uptake in DN dynamin - 2 bb expressing populations can be seen in panel ( D ) . Lastly , transferrin uptake in DN dynamin - 2 ba expressing populations can be seen in panel ( E ) and its effect on dextran uptake in panel ( F ) . Each experiment was analysed using ANOVA with Tukey’s correction . Statistical significance was only observed in transferrin uptake experiments , where DN Dynamin - 2 aa and bb had an inhibitory effect on transferrin uptake compared to WT Dynamin - 2 aa and bb ( p = < 0 . 05 , p = < 0 . 0005 , respectively ) and DN dynamin - 2 ba enhanced transferrin uptake compared to WT dynamin - 2 ba ( p = < 0 . 05 ) . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 153 4 . 4 . 2 Effects of dynamin - 2 splice variants on BTV - 1 infection in BFA cells The effect of expression of dominant negative dynamin - 2 splice variants on BTV infection was investigated next . BFA cells were transfected with the GFP - dynamin constructs ( wild type and dominant negative ) or with a construct expressing GFP alone ( peGFP ) for 12 hours and then infected for a further 12 hours before adding live / dead stain and carrying out cell fixation . The cells were permeabilised and intracellular viral proteins labelled using Anti - BTV Antibody Orab 276 and goat - anti rabbit 647 and the GFP - positive cells and GFP - negative cell populations analysed for infection using flow cytometry . For both dynamin constructs of the dynamin aa splice variant ( wt and DN mutant respectively ) , a significant reduction in infection was seen when the level of infection was compared between the GFP - positive ( expressing ) and GFP negative ( non - expressing ) cell populations ( Figure 4 . 10 A ) . This was also seen for the peGFP plasmid . This suggests that DNA transfection had an inhibitory effect on BTV infection . This effect was also seen for the bb and ba splice variants ( Fig 4 . 10 E and E ) . Analysing the level of BTV protein expression in GFP - positive cells only ( expressing populations ) revealed that the expression of the DN mutant of the ba splice variants ( Figure 4 . 10 , panels ( C ) and ( D ) ) ( One - Way ANOVA , Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 005 , p = < 0 . 005 , respectively ) , but not the aa or bb splice variants , had a significant inhibitory effect on the % of cells expressing BTV proteins suggesting that the dynamin - 2 splice variant ba may play a role in BTV infection . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 154 Figure 4 . 9 Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 155 Figure 4 . 9 The effects of over expression of dominant negative dynamin - 2 splice variants on BTV infection Each DN and WT dynamin - 2 ( GFP - fusion ) splice variant was over expressed in BFA cells for 12h and then cells were infected with BTV for a further 12h . All panels represent flow cytometry data . Empty symbols indicate experiment 1 , solid symbols represent experiment 2 , half - filled symbols identify experiment 3 . GFP expressing and non - expressing populations from the same sample are identified by the same coloured symbols . Expressing and non - expressing cell populations were normalised to account for transfection efficiency . Panels ( A ) , ( C ) and ( E ) show all experimental data including controls . Panels ( B ) , ( D ) and ( F ) represent mean ± SEM data from construct expressing populations only . Panels ( A ) and ( B ) shows data from splice variant dynamin - 2 aa experiments , panels ( C ) and ( D ) exhibits data from splice variant dynamin - 2 bb experiments . Lastly panel ( E ) and ( E ) details data from splice variant dynamin - 2 ba experiments . All data indicated the level of BTV infection in % cells infected . Only DN dynamin - 2 ba splice variant inhibited BTV infection when compared to control plasmids peGFP backbone and WT dynamin - 2 ba ( ANOVA with Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 005 , p = < 0 . 005 , respectively ) . In addition , expressing populations expressing control and DN plasmids had an inhibitory effect on BTV infection compared to non - expressing cell populations . Statistical significance is indicated by stars , where * = p < 0 . 05 , * * = p < 0 . 005 and * * * = p < 0 . 0005 . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 156 4 . 5 Identification of bovine dynamin - 2 splice variants To date splice variants of Dynamin - 2 have only been confirmed in the rat genome ( Sontag et al . , 1994 , Cao et al . , 1998 ) and the wild type and dominant negative constructs used in this study were based on rat sequences . As the DN mutants of rat dynamin - 2 splice variants showed differential effects on BTV infection , it was investigated whether splice variants of dynamin - 2 exist in the bovine genome . This was approached by identifying all published cDNA transcripts for bovine dynamin - 2 ( accession numbers shown in Table 4 . 0 . 1 ) and aligning the sequences against full - length bovine ( Bos taurus ) dynamin - 2 gene ( accession number NM001099369 . 1 ) . The alignment of the transcripts identified polymorphic regions , of which , two regions were of particular interest as two or more transcripts shared the same sequence but were polymorphic compared to the full - length gene sequence . The alignment can be seen in Figure 4 . 10 , polymorphic sites are identified by coloured bands ( showing Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) ) , horizontal black bars ( showing deletions ) and black dots ( showing insertion sites ) . On closer inspection of the two polymorphic regions of interest ( Figure 4 . 10 ) , the two sites aligned against the two splicing sites identified in the rat genome . The first region , which will now be referred to as splicing region 1 ( SR1 ) and is identified by the red box in Figure 4 . 10 and the second region , which will now be referred to as splicing region 2 ( SR2 ) is identified by the blue box in Figure 4 . 10 . The differences in transcript sequence of SR1 can be seen in Figure 4 . 11 and SR2 in Figure 4 . 12 .

In the first splicing region in the rat , two variants have been identified , variant a and b . The alignment of the bovine sequences also identified two sequences in this first region , which were common in at least two or more transcripts . The two sequences identified in the bovine genome were then aligned against variant a and variant b in the first splicing region in the rat genome . Figure 4 . 13 shows a schematic diagram of the dynamin - 2 gene with splicing regions 1 and 2 identified in blue . The bovine sequence for variants a and b in splicing region 1 can be seen in Figure 4 . 13 ( A ) and rat sequence in Figure 4 . 13 ( B ) . The amino acid residues which differ between species is highlighted in red in the sequence , of which two residues differed between species in variant a and a single residue differed between species in variant b . This analysis was repeated for the second region of interest on the bovine genome and this was aligned against the second splicing region of the rat genome . Splicing region 2 of the rat genome also has two possible variants termed variant a or variant b . It was identified that after aligning the bovine sequences with these two variants , identical sequences were shared with both rat and bovine variant sequences in this region , also shows in Figure 4 . 13 . This shows that two splicing regions were able to be identified in the bovine genome and the sequences after analysis only differed by single or double residues in the two splice variants form splicing region 1 and both splice variants were identical in splicing region 2 between the two species . Six transcripts spanned through both splicing regions and so the splice variants can be determined for these transcripts . Of the six transcripts , two splice variants were found to be variant bb , two were found to be variant ab and two were found to be variant ba ( transcripts are identified by a star in Figure 4 . 10 . This gives evidence that at least three of Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 164 the possible four splice variants can be found in the bovine genome , although variant aa is likely to exist but a targeted investigation is needed to identify this variant . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 165 Figure 4 . 13 Figure 4 . 13 Schematic representation of bovine and rat dynamin - 2 showing splice variant amino acid differences Dynamin - 2 has been confirmed to have 2 splicing regions ( shown in panel B ) in the rat , as highlighted by blue ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Through sequence alignments of all published cDNA transcripts for bovine dynamain - 2 similar splicing regions to that of the rat has been identified . Panel A , shows a schematic representation of the two splicing regions identified ( SR1 ) and ( SR2 ) . Each of these splicing regions have been identified as having one of 2 variants , as shown in panel A . Bovine variant a in SR1 identified 2 amino acid differences compared to the rat variant a , as shown by red bold amino acid resides . Bovine variant b showed a single amino acid difference compared to the rat variant b at splicing region 1 . Neither variant a or b had a single amino acid difference compared to the rat at splicing region 2 . Panel B shows each of the rat splice variants at splicing region 1 and 2 with amino acid differences compared to bovine splice variants shown by red bold text in the amino acid sequences .

Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 166 4 . 6 The effects of Dynamin inhibitors on BTV infection in KC cells Results presented in this chapter so far suggest that dynamin is involved in BTV infection of BFA cells ( Chapter 4 , sections 4 . 2 to 4 . 5 ) . Therefore , the role dynamin plays in Culicoides spp . infection in vitro was investigated next to identify whether the virus utilises a shared endocytosis mechanisms in the mammalian and insect host . 4 . 6 . 1 KC cell toxicity upon treatment with pharmacological dynamin inhibitors Cytotoxicity of dynamin inhibitors on KC cells were assessed by incubated with dynamin inhibitors for 12 . 5 hours and then staining cells with an amine reactive dye to distinguish live and dead cells . Cells were analysed by flow cytometry and analysed by gating on live , single cells ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 . 3 ) . Control treated cells ( cells treated with equivalent concentration of drug diluent ) showed the viability compared to untreated cells . Cells treated with either 100µM Dynasore or 30µM Dyngo4a showed a small reduction in cell viability compared to control treated or untreated cells ; however the reduction was not significant . Therefore , both Dynasore and Dyngo4a were investigated for their effects on BTV infection and control ligand uptake in KC cells . 4 . 6 . 2 Effects of pharmacological dynamin inhibitors on transferrin uptake in KC cells The effects of Dynasore on transferrin uptake and BTV - 1 infection were investigated . A small reduction ( but not statistically significant ) in transferrin uptake was observed in cells treated with 100µM Dynasore compared to control treated cells . Figure 4 . 14 B . The Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 167 effects of Dyngo4a on transferrin uptake was also investigated , however , due to technical difficulties the experiment did not produce reliable results and is therefore not presented in this chapter . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 168 Figure 4 . 14 Figure 4 . 14 Effects of dynamin inhibitors on BTV infection in KC cells The effects of dynamin inhibitors Dynasore and Dyngo4a on BTV infection were investigated in KC cells . Cell viability was measured using an amine reactive live / dead stain which was detected using flow cytometry . The effects of the drugs after incubating with KC cells for 12 . 5h can be seen in panel ( A ) . The effects of dynasore on transferrin uptake can be seen in panel ( B ) . Data in panel ( B ) is from two experiments , empty symbols depict experiment 1 and solid symbols experiment 2 . The effects of Dynasore on BTV infection is detailed in panel ( C ) . Pre - treatment and treatment at 1 and 2hpi with Dynasore saw a significant decrease in BTV infection compared to control treated cells ( One - way ANOVA , Tukeys correction , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = 0 . 0005 , respectively ) . Data in panel ( C ) is from two experiments , empty symbols are from experiment 1 and solid symbols from experiment 2 . The effects of Dyngo4a on BTV infection can be seen in panel ( D ) . Highly significant inhibition in infection can be seen in Dyngo4a pre - treated cells compared to control treatment ( One - way ANOVA , Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 0005 ) but treatments post infection had no effect . Graph represents data from four experiments , empty symbols are from experiment 1 , solid symbols are from experiment 2 , half - filled symbols from experiment 3 and crossed symbols are from experiment 4 . Chapter 4 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 169 4 . 6 . 3 Effects of pharmacological dynamin inhibitors on BTV infection in KC cells To determine whether BTV infection in KC cells is dynamin - dependent , two dynamin pharmacological inhibitors , Dynasore and Dyngo4a , were used . KC cells were either pre - treated with dynamin inhibitors or control treatment ( dilution of drug diluent at equivalent concentration to drug ) and then infected or treated with the inhibitor 1 , 2 or 3 hours post infection . Pre - treatment of KC cells with Dynasore appeared to have a strong inhibitory effect on BTV infection compared to matched control treatment Figure 4 . 15 , C ( One - Way ANOVA , Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 0005 ) . However , when cells were treated with Dynasore , post - infection , BTV infection was also inhibited to similar levels and statistical significance , suggesting the drug may be impacting on post entry replication mechanisms . To confirm the need of dynamin in BTV infection , an alternative dynamin inhibitor , Dyngo - 4a , was also investigated . Four independent experiments showed that pre - treatment with Dyngo - 4a resulted in statistical significant inhibition of BTV infection compared to the matched control treatment . Furthermore the inhibitory effect of Dyngo - 4a on BTV infection in KC cells was much more pronounced when the drug was added prior to infection when compared to drug treatments post infection where no significant difference in infection was observed ( Figure 4 . 15 D ) . These observations are similar to those made in BFA cells in section 4 . 2 . 2 .

However , there is some evidence for dynamin existence in insect cells ( Chen et al . , 1991 , van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 , Sontag et al . , 1994 , Gass et al . , 1995 ) . The Culicoides genome project began during the course of this study , which gave an opportunity to interrogate the genome for the presence of a dynamin gene ( carried out in collaboration with Mark Fife and Ramiro Morales - Hojas ) . Alignments of the Culicoides sorensis spp . genome against the coding sequence of Anopholese gambiae ( AGAP003018 - RA ) dynamin gene identified two scaffold sequences which showed good identity against the 5’ and 3’ ends of the A . gambiae dynamin sequence ( Figure 4 . 15 ) . A blast search identified 100 hits , all hits excluding predicted sequences identified 69 – 75 % sequences similarity to other invertebrates , with some identified as known dynamin or dynamin - like genes ( see Table 4 . 0 . 1 ) . Using the two scaffold sequences as a guide for a Culicoides spp dynamin sequence , primers were designed to target the sequence in order to confirm the sequence within KC cells . mRNA was extracted from KC cells and after a reverse transcription reaction using either specific gene primers or random hexamers , sequences were amplified using specific primers designed against the proposed Culicoides dynamin gene . PCR products were then purified and cloned in to a TOPO vector . Five out of seven cloned PCR fragments were identified as having the correct sized insert . From these cloned fragments , four out of five clones gave good quality sequencing reads in both forward and reverse . Forward and reverse reads of all four clones were aligned against the Culicoides scaffold sequence and identified as a dynamin candidate .

The alignment identified regions of good sequence identity but also identified SNPs that were common in two out of four clones and a trinucleotide region that has been deleted in all four clones . Mismatched bases could be seen in the 5’ end of the sequence , which could indicate a region of high variability .

Previously , BTV entry and infection of BHK - 21 cells was shown to be blocked by Dynasore ( a pharmacological inhibitor of dynamin ) but not by the expression of DN Dynamin - 2 aa ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . Some studies have found that entry of a virus could be influenced by the cell type it is entering , as is seen with Adenoviruses ( Bartlett et al . , 2000 , Nonnenmacher and Weber , 2011 ) . Therefore this study used two cell lines , BFA and KC cells , which are both natural host target cells for BTV to identify whether the replication - competent entry pathway used by BTV is dynamin - dependent . This chapter has identified that inhibition of dynamin - 1 , - 2 and - 3 by treatment with pharmacological inhibitor Dyngo4a in BFA cells resulted in inhibition of BTV - 1 infection and entry . Furthermore , treatment of KC cells with dynamin inhibitors , Dyngo4a and Dynasore , also resulted in inhibition of BTV - 1 infection . Expression of siRNA targeting Dynamin - 2 , successfully knocked down expression of Dynamin - 2 in BFA cells in 3 out of 4 transfection conditions tested . Cells that observed knockdown of dynamin - 2 expression also saw a significant inhibition in infection , suggesting that , Dynamin - 2 is required for BTV infection . Additionally , expression of DN dynamin - 2 ba but not dynamin - 2 aa or bb in BFA cells subsequently inhibited BTV infection , suggesting that dynamin - 2 ba splice variant is required for BTV entry and infection . Expression of DN dynamin - 2 ba did not result in inhibition of transferrin uptake . However , expression of DN dynamin - 2 aa and bb did , hinting that BTV is using a dynamin - dependent entry mechanism that is independent of clathrin . Chapter 4 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 175 Inhibition of infection was observed in BFA cells pre - treated with Dyngo4a™ but infection was not inhibited in cells treated with Dyngo4a™ post infection . Dyngo4a™ also inhibited uptake of transferrin , indicating that dynamin has been successfully inhibited and that BTV infection requires dynamin at an early stage of infection ( within the first hour of a cell being infected ) in BFA cells . In contrast , a more prolonged and highly significant inhibition of infection was observed in KC cells that were treated pre - and post - infection with Dynasore . Further investigation also inhibited dynamin with Dyngo4a and identified a statistical significant inhibition of infection in cells pre - treated with the drug but not in post infection treatments in KC cells . In addition , the effect of Dynasore™ on control ligand uptake showed that treatment of KC cells with these drugs showed little effect on uptake of control ligand , transferrin , which uses CME in mammalian cells , whilst an increase in dextran uptake was observed in Dynasore™ treated KC cells ( data not shown ) . This indicates that if these dynamin inhibitors are successfully blocking dynamin in KC cells , it may also cause an up - regulation in fluid phase uptake . The increase in fluid phase uptake observed in these drug treated KC cells , could indicate that any effect on the CME pathway utilised by transferrin may be masked if non - specific fluid phase uptake is triggered . Furthermore it is also possible that as these pharmacological inhibitors were designed to target mammalian dynamin and that their effect in insect cells is not as specific . It is equally possible that transferrin may not utilise the CME pathway in insect cells . Therefore , interpretation of the effects of dynamin inhibitors in insect cells must be conservative without the presence of an insect cell characterised positive uptake control . Nonetheless , these results suggest that BTV infection may require dynamin in KC cells but further characterisation of endocytosis and identification of adequate positive uptake controls in insect cells is required . Chapter 4 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 176 Taken together , results obtained for the mammalian cell line demonstrated that dynamin is required at an early stage of infection in BFA cells . Confocal microscopy of BTV entry with dyngo4a or control treated BFA cells identified that after 2 hours of uptake , virus was clearly visible in the cytosol of control treated cells but could only be visualised at the cell periphery in dyngo4a treated cells . This indicated that entry of the virus required a dynamin - dependent step in BFA cells . Several endocytosis pathways require dynamin but this information allows the endocytosis mechanism utilised by the virus to be narrowed down . However , a recent study using cells that have had all three dynamin isoforms knocked out ( dynamin - 1 , 2 and 3 ) , identified dynamin inhibitors Dynasore™ and Dyngo4a™ inhibited fluid phase endocytsosis and peripheral membrane ruffling , which were not impaired by the lack of dynamin . This indicates that , both Dynasore™ and Dyngo4a™ could impact dynamin - independent pathways as well as dynamin - dependent pathways ( ( Park et al . , 2013 ) ) . Therefore , dynamin - dependence of BTV entry and replication must be assessed using multiple methods . To investigate dynamin - dependence in more detail , siRNA was used to down - regulate the translation of the dynamin - 2 protein , therefore , inhibiting GTPase activity and protein - protein interactions . Transfection of single siRNAs have been known to cause off target effects by triggering cellular immune responses but transfection of siRNA pools negates unwanted off target effects ( ( Hannus et al . , 2014 ) ) , so to navigate this pitfall , transfection of dual siRNAs with the same protein target but differing target sequence was used in this investigation . Three experiments using siRNA to target dynamin were described in this chapter . Each experiment showed combinations of single and double siRNA transfections . The first siRNA experiment showed transfection of the single siRNA 657 and a combination of dual transfection of siRNA 657 and 141 , successfully knocked down dynamin - 2 protein Chapter 4 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 177 production compared to the scrambled controls . Inhibition in infection was also observed in the same siRNA transfected conditions that observed dynamin - 2 knockdown , indicating that even a small reduction in dynamin - 2 protein production has a significant effect on BTV infection . These experiments identify that upon successful inhibition of dynamin - 2 protein production , BTV infection can also be inhibited . This demonstrates that there is a requirement of dynamin - 2 in BTV infection . The complexity that dynamin exists in at least 3 isoforms and each of these isoforms have been found to have multiple splice variants , raises the question , if these dynamins are redundant or do they have distinct cellular functions . The interplay between CME and fluid phase endocytosis , particularly macropinocytosis , has been controversially argued . However , studies using dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 knock out cells revealed that dynamin - 2 involvement in CME and fluid phase endocytosis is mechanistically distinct ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) . Previous studies suggested otherwise but were reliant upon over expression of dynamin isoforms and not the removal of endogenous dynamins , which are in some cases able to compensate if one isoform / splice variant is suppressed ( Altschuler et al . , 1998 ) . The multi - faceted approach of investigating the role of dynamin in BTV infection in this chapter has highlighted that , at least for Dynamin - 2 , splice variants are likely to have distinct functions in endocytosis and intracellular trafficking . Each of the three dynamin - 2 splice variants had alternate ligand uptake profile . Dominant negative dynamin - 2 aa and dynamin - 2 bb inhibited transferrin uptake , however did not inhibit dextran uptake . Whereas , the dominant - negative , dynamin - 2 ba constructs did not inhibit dextran or transferrin uptake . In fact , expression of DN dynamin - 2 ba splice variant Chapter 4 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 178 significantly increased transferrin uptake , which suggests inhibition of dynamin - 2 ba enhances CME . This could possibly reflect that splice variant ba may be involved in an alternative endocytosis mechanism and inhibition of this pathway may upregulate CME . The differences in the ligand uptake profiles of these constructs indicate that they exhibit functional differences in endocytosis . This is further strengthened by the fact that only a single dominant - negative construct , dynamin - 2 ba , inhibits BTV infection , indicating that , dynamin - 2 splice variants have specificity in their function . This is the first time that evidence of a single splice variant has been found to be implicated to be required for infection by a pathogen . This opens up the opportunity of a more targeted approach of therapeutics , which are able to target the splice variant specifically involved in pathogen infection and thus reducing the potential of unwanted off target effects . Dynamin inhibitors are already being trialled for cancer therapy and Dynasore™ has successfully been trialled in mice to treat Athleroscerosis ( Chen et al . , 1991 , Chircop et al . , 2011a , Joshi et al . , 2011 , Chircop et al . , 2011b ) . This demonstrates that the use of dynamin splice variants as a target for the treatment of disease could be plausible and may negate development of resistance that is often generated against drugs that target the pathogen directly . An interesting observation made from the effects of DN dynamin - 2 splice variant expression on BTV infection was that expression of any DNA , in cells appeared to inhibit BTV infection . It is possible that the inhibitory effect on BTV infection observed may be indicative of transfected DNA triggering innate antiviral defences ( Unterholzner et al . , 2010 ) . Dynamin - 2 splice variants have only been published within the rat genome ( Sontag et al . , 1994 , Cao et al . , 1998 ) . However , it is likely that other splice variants are present in other mammals . In order to confirm the existence of dynamin - 2 splice variants in bovine cells , Chapter 4 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 179 published cDNA transcripts from bovine dynamin - 2 were analysed with the view to identify dynamin - 2 splice variants that may be present in the bovine genome . Multiple sequence alignment of all transcripts against the full - length bovine gene , identified two splicing regions in the same sequence position as found in the rat genome . These splicing regions had one of two possible sequences , which are able to give rise to 4 splice variants , as is seen in the rat genome . Closer comparison revealed a 2 amino acids difference in variant a in splicing region 1 between bovine and rat genome and a single amino acid change is seen in variant b in splicing region 1 . No amino acid differences are seen in either variant a or b in splicing region 2 compared to the rat genome . By examining transcripts which spanned splicing region 1 and 2 in the bovine dynamin - 2 gene , it was possible to identify 3 of the possible 4 splice variants as being present in the bovine genome . The forth splice variant is likely to exist but a targeted study is needed to confirm variant aa’s presence in the bovine genome . As sequences of the splice variants only have minor differences as those seen in the rat splice variants , it is likely that the splice variants expressed in this study share similar biological functions to the bovine splice variants which have been identified . The shibire gene in the Drosophila spp . genome ( Swanson and Poodry , 1981 ) has been identified as sharing 66 % identity with both mammalian dynamin - 1 and dynamin - 2 ( Sontag et al . , 1994 ) and was shown to have dynamin - like functionality ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) . This suggested that dynamin existed in invertebrates as well as vertebrates . Since then , single dynamin genes have been annotated in Aedes aegypti , Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopholes gambiae genomes and functional studies looking at dynamin - dependence in virus entry studies in mosquitoes have also found mosquito cells to have dynamin functionality ( Lee et al . , 2013 , Acosta et al . , 2011 ) . As there has not been a Culicoides genome available , until now , it was unknown as to whether a dynamin gene Chapter 4 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 180 existed in the Culicoides spp genome . Interrogation of the Culicoides sorensis genome sequences currently being generated at The Pirbright Institute , has identified scaffold sequences that share high sequence identifity ( 69 - 75 % ) to dynamin genes located in the mosquito and Drosophila spp genomes . These scaffold sequences were then used to confirm a region of the dynamin - like sequences in KC cells by reverse transcription PCR of extracted mRNA from KC cells and cloning PCR products for sequencing purposes . Complimentary bioinformatics suggest the presence of dynamin - 2 splice variants in the bovine genome and also the presence of a dynamin gene in the Culicoides spp genome . The clones identified a trinucleotide that was missing in all four clones compared to the scaffold sequence and common SNPs that are present in some but not all clone sequences . Some regions were found to be identical to that of the scaffold sequence from the Culicoides genome project and indicated this is likely a dynamin - like gene but functionality needs confirmation . In addition , identification of sequence variation between the clones indicated that there may be splice variants in invertebrate dynamin genes too . However , this needs further investigation but as Drosophila spp . has been shown to have multiple dynamin isoforms ( Chen et al . , 1991 ) , it is likely that multiple variants also exist in the Culicoides spp . genome . To conclude , this chapter has identified a role for dynamin in an early event in BTV infection of host derived BFA and KC cells . Dynamin - 2 splice variant ba but not splice variants aa and bb was implicated as playing a role in BTV infection . Complementary ligand uptake profiles of the dynamin - 2 splice variants also provided evidence that whilst BTV infection of BFA cells is dynamin - dependent , it occurs independent of clathrin . Bioinformatic analysis also identified splice variants in the bovine dynamin - 2 gene . This chapter also confirmed the presence of a dynamin - 2 gene in the Culicoides spp . genome Chapter 4 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 181 project and provides preliminary evidence that splice variants may also exist in the midge dynamin - 2 . Chapter 5 – Investigating the entry mechanisms utilized by BTV in BFA cells Chapter 5 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 183 183183 5 . 1 Introduction Previous studies investigating entry mechanisms utilized by BTV have used mammalian cell culture adapted viruses and standard tissue culture cell lines such as BSR , BHK or VERO cells which are not derived from the natural hosts or the cell type normally targeted by BTV ( Gold et al . , 2010 , Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . These studies concluded that BTV - 10 enters cells via CME in BSR cells ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) whereas BTV - 1 uses a non - classical dynamin - dependent macropinocytosis - like mechanism in BHK - 21 cells ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . This chapter investigates the entry mechanism utilised by a field isolate of BTV - 1 ( BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 KC3 ) , to infect a bovine foetal aorta endothelial cell line ( BFA ) as endothelial cells are a natural cell targeted during BTV infection of cattle and sheep in vivo . Furthermore the BTV - 1 strain was also purified to generate a homogenous virus particle preparation while avoiding the influence of cellular or “free” viral proteins present in tissue culture supernatant preparations . In chapter 4 , it was confirmed that BTV requires dynamin - 2 for infection and entry in BFA cells and is likely to be required for infection of KC cells ( see Chapter 4 ) . Furthermore , experiments with DN mutants of different dynamin - 2 splice variants suggested that the specific variant needed for BTV infection is Dynamin - 2 ba . Overall , dynamin - 2 is essential for many endocytic pathways such as : CME , caveolae - mediated endocytosis , IL2R endocytosis , phagocytosis , Arf6 mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling and is also necessary for some forms of macropinocytosis . Dynamin - 2 is not required for CLIC / GLEEC endocytosis and other dynamin independent pathways such as dynamin - independent macropinocytosis ( Reviewed in ( Harper et al . , 2013 ) ) . This chapter aims to Chapter 5 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 184 184184 identify the dynamin - dependent endocytosis pathway utilized by a field isolate of BTV to enter BFA cells . Entry mechanisms were studied using transient expression of DN proteins and pharmacological inhibitors of cellular endocytosis pathways . The inhibitors were screened for cytotoxicity and validated using control ligands ; transferrin ( an established CME marker ) and dextran ( an established marker for fluid phase uptake , particularly macropinocytosis ) prior to investigating the effect of the inhibitors of BTV uptake and infection . 5 . 2 Investigating the requirement of acidic endosomes in BTV infection and the rate of trafficking to acidic compartments Previous publications have suggested BTV requires a low pH - dependent step in order to initiate infection ( Gold et al . , 2010 , Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . To confirm this observation for the BTV - 1 field isolate and BFA cells , the effects of using ammonium chloride on BTV infection was investigated . Ammonium chloride is a lysosomotropic weak base and raises endosomal pH by acting as a buffer in the acidic environment within endosomes ( Baxt , 1987 , Carrillo et al . , 1984 , Martin - Acebes et al . , 2007 ) . BFA cells were pre - treated with 25mM ammonium chloride for 30 minutes and infected with BTV . The cells were fixed after 16 hours of infection , labelled for virus protein and analysed for the population of cells expressing viral proteins using flow cytometry ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 . 1 ) . In cells pre - treated with ammonium chloride infection was significantly less compared to untreated cells indicating that BTV requires a pH dependent step to initiate infection ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . Chapter 5 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 185 185185 The rate of delivery of a pH - dependent virus to acidic compartments provides clues to which endocytosis mechanism is used . For example , viruses and natural ligands that use CME usually reach early endosomes within 5 to 10 minutes post - entry ( Berryman et al . , 2005 , Baxt and Bachrach , 1982 ) . Therefore , in order to determine the rate of delivery of BTV to acidic compartments the cells were also treated with ammonium chloride at different time points post infection ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . When ammonium chloride was added to cells 1 hour post infection , a significant decrease of virus infected cells was observed compared to untreated cells . When added at later times post infection there was a small but statistically not significant reduction in the number of infected cells . The data shown in Figure 5 . 1 suggests that at 1 hour post infection approximately 50 % of the virus has reached an acidic compartment consistent with a relatively slow rate of delivery to acidic compartments suggesting a clathrin - independent entry mechanism . Chapter 5 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 186 186186 Figure 5 . 1 Figure 5 . 1 Delivery kinetics of BTV to acidic compartments BFA cells were infected with BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 KC3 for 16 hours . Ammonium chloride ( 25mM ) was added to cells at different time points during infection : pre - treatment or 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 h . p . i . or during the last 5 minutes of infection . Cells were fixed and labelled with Orab 276 prior to flow cytometry analysis . Data was obtained by gating on single , live cells . The graph shows combined data from two repeated experiments each carried out in triplicate . The data are shown as the mean % cells infected and ±SEM . ANOVA and Tukey’s analysis identified a statistically significant inhibition in infection between untreated cells and cells pre - treated and treated at 1h . p . i with 25mM Ammonium chloride ( p = < 0 . 0005 ) . After 1 hour of internalisation , approximately 50 % of virus has been delivered to an acidic compartment . Chapter 5 : Understanding early events in Bluetongue virus cell entry 187 187187 5 . 2 . 1 Field isolate BTV - 1 entry kinetics in Bovine Foetal Aorta Endothelial Cells Entry of the BTV - 1 field isolate was also investigated for BFA cells using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy . Entry was synchronised by pre - binding virus on ice for 1 hour . Cells were then washed with pre - warmed media and entry initiated by warming to 37°C . At the indicated time points the cells were fixed with 4 % PFA and processed for confocal microscopy . Viral proteins were labelled using an anti - BTV antibody ( see Appendix C ) . The actin cytoskeleton ( green ) and nucleus ( blue ) were visualised using respective dyes ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 8 . 1 ) . To allow visualisation of BTV - 1 entering the cell , high viral particle to cell ratio was required and so confocal entry experiments were carried out with 6μg purified BTV - 1 compared to 0 . 12µg used for infection studies . Before warming , virus labelling ( red ) was seen at the cell surface , which is marked by actin ( shown in green ) ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . An actin rich cortex can be seen at the cell periphery , just deep of the plasma membrane , with filopodia - like actin structures projecting from the cell periphery . Some labelling for BTV was seen in association with the apical tips of the projected actin structures . After 30 minutes uptake , ( Figure 5 . 3 ) BTV labelling was seen embedded within the actin rich cortex but virus still appears to be predominantly at the periphery of the cell . After an hour of uptake , most BTV labelling remained at the cell periphery but appeared to have accumulated in more intensely labelled puncta . Furthermore , the majority of cells showing positive BTV labelling appeared to show a global actin reorganisation . Actin was no longer seen as a rich cortex at the cell periphery but instead appeared as low intensity labelling in the cell cytoplasm ( Figure 5 . 4 ) . This was observed for the majority ( approx . 70 % ) of cells that were positive for BTV labelling . After 90 minutes of uptake , BTV labelling was seen within the cell cytoplasm ( Figure 5 . 5 ) . At this stage , actin labelling was also mostly seen in the cytoplasm . These results are consistent with the ammonium chloride experiments and suggest a slow rate of BTV - 1 .

As previous investigations implicated CME as a BTV entry mechanism ( ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) ) , the requirement for CME was investigated using pharmacological inhibitors and transient expression of a DN mutants of eps15 ( eps15 is an initiation factor required for clathrin pit formation ) . 5 . 3 . 1 Chlorpromazine is ineffective at inhibiting CME in BFA cells but inhibits BTV infection The pharmacological inhibitor , Chlorpromazine is reported to inhibit CME by inhibiting adaptor protein 2 ( AP - 2 ) binding to the clathrin lattice and thus preventing formation of clathrin - coated pits ( Wang et al . , 1993 ) . Initially a range of concentrations of Chlorpromazine ( from 1 . 25µg / ml to 320μg / ml ) were tested for toxicity on BFA cells by incubation for 12 . 5 hours ( consistent with the duration of an inhibitor / infection study ) . After this time , the cellular ATPase activity of cells were measured using a luciferase based ToxGlo assay ( Promega ) ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 9 . 3 ) . At concentrations higher than 10μg / ml cytotoxicy was observed and therefore 10μg / ml was the highest possible non - toxic concentration that could be used for BTV infection experiments ( Figure 5 . 6 ( A ) ) . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 194 Figure 5 . 6 Figure 5 . 6 Effects of Clathrin inhibitor , Chlorpromazine , on BTV - 1 infection of BFA cells ( A ) Cellular ATPase was measured for Chlorpromazine treated and untreated BFA cells using a luminesence assay and LOG10 data and mean ± SD was plotted . The highest non - toxic concentration , 10μg / ml was used to test effectiveness in blocking CME . ( B ) Cells were treated with the drug or control treated for 30 minutes and allowed to take up , transferrin . Fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry , determined from single , live cells and displayed as mean fluorescent intensity ( MFI ) indicating average fluorescent uptake of transferrin within cells . No inhibition of transferrin uptake was observed in two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate , empty symbols = experiment 1 , solid symbols = experiment 2 . ( C ) The effect of 10μg / ml Chlorpromazine on BTV infection was quantified using flow cytometry . The % of infected cells was determined from single , live cells . Three repeat experiments carried out in triplicate are displayed , empty symbols = experiment 1 , solid symbols = experiment 2 and half - filled symbols = experiment 3 . Chlorpromazine pre - treated cells show a significant effect on BTV infection when compared to control treated cells . All post infection treatments show no significant effect on infection . A B C Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 195 The inhibitory activity of the drug at 10μg / ml was tested by using the control ligand , transferrin , which enters cells via CME ( Harding et al . , 1983 , Harding and Stahl , 1983 , Hopkins et al . , 1985 , Hanover et al . , 1984 ) . If the drug inhibited CME there would be a decrease in transferrin uptake . BFA cells were pre - treated with 10μg / ml Chlorpromzine or control treatment for 30 minutes at 37 o C and then incubated with transferrin labelled with Alexa - Fluor 647 for 15 minutes . Control treatment for all pharmacological inhibitors in this chapter is the drug diluent ( e . g . DMSO ) at dilution for the drug ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 9 . 1 , Table 2 . 2 ) . Cells were then fixed and prepared for analysis using flow cytometry ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 . 1 ) . At a concentration of 10μg / ml , there was no inhibition of transferrin uptake in BFA cells compared to control treatment indicating that the highest possible non - toxic dose was not effective at inhibiting CME . Despite the drug being ineffective at inhibiting transferrin uptake the effects on BTV infection were still investigated . Cells were either pre - treated with 10μg / ml Chlorpromazine or treated with the drug at 1 , 3 or 6 hours post infection . After treatment the drug remained present throughout the assay . Cells were harvested , fixed and labelled for infection and prepared for flow cytometry analysis ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 . 1 ) . Cultures pre - treated with Chlorpromazine showed a significant inhibition in the proportion of cells becoming infected with BTV compared to the control treated control cells . However , no significant inhibition of cell infection was observed in cultures treated with the drug at 1 , 3 or 6 hours post infection . As Chlorpromazine did not appear to inhibit CME ( i . e . transferrin uptake ) it could not be concluded that the inhibitory effect on infection was due to preventing CME . Hence , these results might suggest that the inhibition of BTV infection following treatment of cells with Chlorpromazine could be a result of non - specific , off target effects of the drug . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 196 5 . 3 . 2 Clathrin inhibitor , Pitstop 2 , does not inhibit BTV infection As Chlorpromazine was ineffective at inhibiting CME , an alternative inhibitor , Pitstop 2 , was used to investigate the role of CME in BTV infection . Pitstop 2 has been shown to selectively inhibit the uptake of transferrin and HIV , which can enter some cells via CME ( Harding et al . , 1983 , Harding and Stahl , 1983 , Hanover et al . , 1984 , Hopkins , 1985 , Hopkins et al . , 1985 ) . Pitstop 2 is reported to interfere with clathrin coated pit assembly , specifically with adapter protein 2 ( AP2 ) binding to the clathrin lattice ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) . The cellular ATPase activity was measured using a luciferase based assay ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 9 . 3 ) in BFA cells when exposed to a range of Pitstop 2 concentrations ( 2 . 5μM to 240µM ) for 12 . 5 hours . Pitstop 2 was shown to be non - toxic to BFA cells up to and including 120µM ( Figure 5 . 7 ( A ) ) . Previous studies have identified an effective concentration of Pitstop 2 to be approximately 30µM ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , 30µM Pitstop 2 was tested to identify whether it was able to inhibit transferrin uptake . Cells pre - treated with Pitstop 2 showed a statistically significant inhibition of transferrin uptake compared to the control treated control ( see section 2 . 9 . 1 for details of control treatment ) ( ANOVA , Tukey’s correction p = < 0 . 0005 ) ( Figure 5 . 7 ( B ) ) . This confirmed that Pitstop 2 actively inhibited CME in BFA cells at a concentration of 30µM . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 197 B Figure 5 . 7 C Figure 5 . 7 Effects of Clathrin inhibitor , Pitstop 2 , on BTV - 1 infection of BFA cells ( A ) Cellular ATPase of Pitstop 2 treated and untreated BFA cells was measured using a luminesence assay and LOG10 data and mean ± SD was plotted . ( B ) The highest non - toxic concentration was 120µM . 30µM was used to test effectiveness in blocking CME . Cells were treated with drug or control treated for 30 minutes and allowed to take up CME positive control ligand , transferrin . Fluoresence was measured using flow cytometry and determined from single , live cells . Pitstop 2 pre - treated cells displayed a significant inhibition of transferrin uptake and this was observed in two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate , empty symbols = experiment 1 , solid symbols = experiment 2 ( ANOVA p = < 0 . 0005 ) compared to control treated cells . ( C ) The effect of 30µM Pitstop 2 on BTV infection was quantified using flow cytometry and virus antibody labelling . The % of infected cells were determined from single , live cells . Two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate are displayed , empty symbols = experiment 1 and solid symbols = experiment 2 . Pitstop 2 pre - treated cells and post infection treated cells had no significant effect on BTV infection when compared to control treated cells . A Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 198 Next the effect of Pitsop - 2 on BTV infection was investigated . At 30µM , Pistop2 was ineffective at inhibiting BTV infection either upon pre - treatment of post - infection treatment of cells with the drug ( Figure 5 . 7 ( C ) ) . This strongly suggests that BTV does not require CME for infection of BFA cells . 5 . 3 . 3 Transient expression of DN Eps15 does not inhibit BTV infection To confirm the observations made with Pitstop 2 , DN Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Substrate Clone 15 ( eps15 ) mutants were used to see further investigate the role of CME in BTV infection . Eps15 facilitates docking of the adapter protein - 2 ( AP - 2 ) at the plasma membrane to allow correct assembly of clathrin coated pits ( see Chapter 1 , section 1 . 11 . 1 ) ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . Mutations of the EH domains of eps15 result in aberrant targeting of eps15 to the plasma membrane thereby preventing clathrin and AP - 2 recruitment to coated pit formation ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . In this study , two DN mutants of eps15 were used and compared to a control eps15 construct to see the effects on BTV infection . The DN construct , DIII , lacks the eps15 homology ( EH ) and the coil domain but retains the AP - 2 binding domains . The second DN construct , EH29 , lacks part of the eps15 homology domain only . Both constructs are known to inhibit clathrin pit formation ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . The control construct D3Δ2 , has EH , coil and AP - 2 binding domain missing but does not appear to impact on the formation of clathrin coated pits ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . These proteins were expressed as GFP fusions . A control plasmid , which expresses GFP alone was used as an additional control . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 199 Figure 5 . 8 A B C Figure 5 . 8 Effects of DN eps15 expression on BTV - 1 infection of BFA cells Control plasmids peGFP backbone or D3Δ2 and DN eps15 constructs DIII and EH29 were over expressed in BFA cells and the effects of over expression of these constructs on transferrin uptake and BTV infection . Panel ( A ) shows the effects of overexpression of control plasmid D3Δ2 or DN eps15 constructs DIII or EH29 on transferrin uptake . Mean fluorescent intensity of internalised transferrin was ascertained from single , live cells using flow cytometry . Expressers of DN eps15 constructs DIII and EH29 observed a significant decrease in transferrin uptake compared to control plasmid D3Δ2 . Panel ( B ) shows the effects of DN eps15 constructs and control plasmids D3Δ2 , peGFP and DN eps15 constructs on BTV infection . Non - expressing and expressing populations can be observed . Significant differences in infection are observed between expressing and non - expressing populations of both control and DN constructs . Panel ( C ) displays infection data of expressing cell populations only . There was no significant difference in infection between DN eps15 constructs compared to the control plasmid D3Δ2 . Infected cells were labelled for virus by using an antibody Orab 276 and level of infection . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 200 The DN eps15 - GFP fusions were overexpressed in BFA cells for 12 hours and their effect on the uptake of transferrin quantified using flow cytometry . The expressing cell populations for the DN eps15 mutants , DIII and EH29 , were compared to the expressing cells for the control D3Δ2 ( expression determined by the expression of the GFP fluorescent signal from the fusion protein ) . A significant inhibition of transferrin uptake was seen for the DN mutants ( DIII and EH29 ) compared to the control cells ( D3Δ2 ) ( ANOVA with Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 005 , p = < 0 . 005 , respectively ) ( Fugure 5 . 8 ( A ) ) . GFP alone and the eps15 control plus the DN mutants were then overexpressed for 12 hours in BFA cells and their effects on BTV infection ( for a 12 hours infection ) was measured using flow cytometry ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 ) . For each transfection , the GFP expressing populations ( indicated by GFP fluorescence ) were compared with the non - expressing ( i . e . non - fluorescent ) population . This showed a significant inhibition of infection for the GFP transfected cells and all eps15 populations regardless of whether they express a DN or control protein . This suggests that DNA transfection of BFA cells reduces BTV infection ( Figure 5 . 8 ( B ) ) . However , when infection was compared for the cell populations expressing the control eps15 ( D3Δ2 ) and DN mutants ( DIII or EH29 ) no significant inhibition of infection was seen suggesting , that CME is not required for BTV infection ( Figure 5 . 8 ( C ) ) . 5 . 4 Investigating the requirement of Caveolae - dependent endocytosis specific cellular factors in BTV infection Cholesterol is involved in many endocytosis pathways most notably caveolae - dependent / lipid raft endocytosis ( Pelkmans and Helenius , 2003 ) but to a lesser extent has Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 201 also been noted to be involved in macropinocytosis and CME as cholesterol provides fluidity during plasma membrane rearrangements ( Grimmer et al . , 2002 ) . Many cholesterol - dependent endocytosis mechanisms are often associated with slow cellular entry . Therefore , as BTV was shown to reach acidic compartments and enter cells relatively slowly the requirement of cholesterol for BTV infection was investigated . 5 . 4 . 1 BTV infection in BFA cells does not require cholesterol Methyl - β - cyclodextrin selectively depletes cholesterol from the plasma membranes ( Ormerod et al . , 2012 , Kilsdonk et al . , 1995 ) . Measurement of cellular ATPase activity of cells in the presence of a range of Methyl - β - cyclodextrin concentrations for 12 . 5 hours showed that concentrations above 5mM were toxic to BFA cells ( Figure 5 . 9 ( A ) ) . To identify whether 5mM was sufficient to deplete plasma membrane cholesterol from the cell , cells were treated with the Methyl - β - cyclodextrin or control treated ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 9 . 1 , Table 2 . 2 ) for 30 minutes . Cells were then fixed and cholesterol labelled using Fillipin . Fillipin allows cholesterol to be visualised as its absorbance properties alter when it interacts and binds with cholesterol . Control treated cells showed bright fluorescence indicating the presence of cholesterol and concentrated labelling was seen at the plasma membrane and in cytoplasmic puncta consistent with a vesicular location Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 202 ( Figure 5 . 9 ( B ) ) . In contrast , upon treatment with 5mM Methyl - β - cyclodextrin , very little fluorescence was observed at the plasma membrane and reduced fluorescence was seen in the cytoplasm indicating that plasma membrane cholesterol has been depleted with treatment of 5mM Methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( Figure 5 . 9 ( B ) ) . The effects of methyl - β - cyclodextrin on BTV infection were investigated next . BFA Cells were either pre - treated for 30 minutes prior to BTV infection or at different time points post infection . All conditions tested had no significant effect on the proportion of cells infected with BTV . Some reduction in infection could be observed in pre - treated cells and 1 hour post infection , although this did not prove to be statistically significant ( Figure 5 . 9 C ) which might indicate that cholesterol plays a minor role in BTV infection . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2003 A Figure 5 . 9 Control treated MβCD treated B C D Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2013 Figure 5 . 9 Effects of Cholesterol inhibitor , Methyl - β - cyclodextrin , on BTV - 1 infection of BFA cells ( A ) Cellular ATPase of methyl - β - cyclodextrin treated and untreated BFA cells was measured using a luminesence assay and LOG10 data and mean ± SD was plotted . The highest non - toxic concentration was 5mM . ( B ) and ( C ) 5mM was used to test effectiveness in depleting cholesterol from the cell . Cells were treated with drug or control treated for 30 minutes and fixed cells were stained with Fillipin . ( B ) Control treated cells stained brightly with fillipin , indicating that cholesterol was present in plasma membrane , ER and in vesicle - like puncta throughout the cell . ( C ) However , little fluoresence was detected in drug treated cells , suggesting cholesterol had been depleted . ( D ) The effect of 5mM methyl - β - cyclodextrin on BTV infection was quantified using flow cytometry and virus antibody labelling . The % of infected cells was determined from single , live cells . Two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate are displayed , empty symbols = experiment 1 and solid symbols = experiment 2 . Methyl - β - cyclodextrin pre - treated and post infection treated cells had no significant effect on BTV infection when compared to control treated cells . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2023 5 . 5 Investigating the requirement of macropinocytosis specific cellular factors in BTV infection So far investigations have suggested that the dynamin - 2 splice variant ba ( a splice variant known to be involved in macropinocytosis ( Cao et al . , 2007 ) is required for BTV infection ( See Chapter 4 ) . In this chapter evidence has also shown that BTV entry and delivery to acidic compartments is relatively slow ( which is also consistent with macropinocytosis ) . In addition , as actin reorganisation is required for macropinocytosis the apparent actin reorganisation observed during BTV entry further supports macropinocytosis as a possible entry mechanism . Macropinocytosis results in internalisation of large volumes of extracellular fluid and requires a number of cellular factors including sodium - proton exchangers , the actin cytoskeleton , kinases and small GTPases ( reviewed in ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) ) . A number of viruses have previously been found to utilize macropinocytosis to gain entry to cells ( Mercer and Helenius , 2008 , Mercer and Helenius , 2010 , Mercer et al . , 2010a , Rossman et al . , 2012 , Aleksandrowicz et al . , 2011 ) . Many pharmacological inhibitors have been developed that are able to inhibit these cellular factors and thus inhibit macropinocytosis ( Koivusalo et al . , 2010 , Deacon et al . , 2008 ) . The use of these inhibitors allows interrogation of the macropinocytosis pathway and gives an insight into whether BTV utilizes macropinocytosis for entry . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2033 5 . 5 . 1 BTV infection in BFA cells requires actin A major reorganisation of actin was observed during BTV entry ( Figure 5 . 2 to Figure 5 . 55 ) , therefore , the role actin plays in BTV infection was investigated . The inhibitory effects of Cytochalasin D on actin polymerisation and elongation have long been known ( Brenner and Korn , 1980 , Flanagan and Lin , 1980 ) . It is now understood that activation of a signalling cascade by receptor tyrosine kinases is responsible for inducing actin remodelling during macropinocytosis , which subsequently generates plasma membrane ruffling , an indicative characteristic of macropinocytosis ( reviewed in ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) ) . Actin , therefore , plays a crucial role in the macropinocytic pathway , and localised actin reorganisation allows cargo to be engulfed by the remodelling of the plasma membrane and allows the formation of the macropinosome . Cytochalasin D inhibits macropinocytosis by causing mass disruption of the cytoskeletal organisation of actin filaments ( Schliwa , 1982 ) . In order to ascertain the toxicity of Cytochalasin D on BFA cells , cells were treated with a range of Cytochalasin D concentrations ( from 1 . 25µg / ml to 160µg / ml ) for 12 . 5 hours . Cellular ATPase measurements identified that all concentrations tested did not reduce cellular ATPase activity , indicating that Cytochalasin D has little toxic effects on BFA cells ( Figure 5 . 10 ( A ) ) . A concentration of 10µg / ml was selected to investigate whether it is able to successfully disrupt the actin cytoskeleton . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2043 A Figure 5 . 10 D Figure 5 . 10 Effects of cytochalasin D on BTV infection ( A ) Cellular ATPase of cytochalasin D treated and untreated BFA cells was measured using a luminesence assay and LOG10 data and mean ± SD was plotted . The highest non - toxic concentration was 160µg / ml . 10µg / ml was used to test effectiveness in disrupting the F - actin cytoskeleton . Cells were treated with drug or control treated for 30 minutes and fixed cells were stained with Phalloidin - AF488 . ( B ) Control treated cells stained brightly with phalloidin at the cell periphery , indicating that stable actin cytoskeleton was present . ( C ) However , no concentration of F - actin was seen in Cytochalasin D treated cells instead in puncta throughout the cytoplasm indicating the cytoskeleton was disrupted . ( D ) The effect of 10µg / ml cytochalasin D on BTV infection was quantified using flow cytometry and virus antibody labelling . The % of infected cells was Control treated Cytochalasin D treated B C Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2053 determined from single , live cells . Two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate are displayed , empty symbols = experiment 1 and solid symbols = experiment 2 . Methyl - β - cyclodextrin pre - treated and post infection treated cells at 1 and 2hpi had significant inhibitory effect on BTV infection when compared to control treated cells . Cells treated at 3 and 6 hpi saw no significant difference in infection compared to the control treatment . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2063 2 BFA cells were treated with 10µg / ml Cytochalasin D control treatment ( see Chapter 2 section 2 . 9 . 1 , Table 2 . 2 ) for 30 minutes . Cells were then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence by staining F - actin filaments with phalloidin , AlexaFluor 488 and DAPI nuclear stain ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 8 ) . Control treated cells had a strong labelling at the cell periphery and some cytomplasmic signal ( Figure 5 . 10 ( B ) ) . In contrast , in Cytochalasin D treated cells actin appeared to be disrupted in the cytosol and no labelling was seen at the cell periphery ( Figure 5 . 10 ( C ) ) . Pre - treatment of BFA cells with 10µg / ml Cytochalasin D inhibited BTV infection significantly . In order to determine whether actin was required for entry or during replication of BTV , Cytochalasin D was added at different time points post infection . Addition of Cytochalasin D at 1 and 2 hours post infection also resulted in a significant inhibition of infection . However , drug treatment at 3 and 6 hours post infection did not appear to inhibit infection ( Figure 5 . 10 ( D ) ) , indicating that actin is required for an early stage of BTV infection . 5 . 5 . 2 BTV infection in BFA cells requires NHE1 Amiloride , a pharmacological inhibitor of sodium - proton exchangers , has aided the understanding of the requirement of sodium - proton ( Na + / H + ) exchangers in macropinocytosis ( Koivusalo et al . , 2010 ) . However , Amiloride has also been shown to inhibit the sodium channel ( Na + ) and sodium - calcium ( Na + / Ca + + ) exchanger ( Masereel et al . , 2003 ) . Consequently , a number of more specific analogues of Amiloride have been developed that target sodium proton exchangers with higher specificity . One such inhibitor Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2073 2 is known as EIPA , ( 5 - ( N - Ethyl - N - isopropyl ) amiloride ) has been shown to have a strong potency and selectivity for the NHE1 and reduced off - target selectivity for the Na + channel and the Na + / Ca + + exchangers ( Masereel et al . , 2003 ) . The role of the NHE1 in macropinocytosis has been debated but it is widely believed that the role that sodium - proton exchangers play in the homeostasis of cytosolic and sub - membranous pH allows the small GTPases to be activated when the right pH is maintained . Sodium - proton exchanger inhibitors work by causing acidification of the sub - membranous pH , which actin remodelling GTPases are sensitive to and therefore inhibit the GTPase dependent - macropinocytosis ( Koivusalo et al . , 2010 ) . Toxic effects of EIPA were observed when cells were treated with concentrations above 100µM when cellular ATPase activity was measured after different concentrations of EIPA were present on cells for 12 . 5hours ( Figure 5 . 11 ( A ) ) . Therefore , a maximum of 100µM EIPA was used for subsequent experiments . The ability of EIPA to inhibit macropinocytosis was tested by observing the effect the drug has on fluid phase uptake marker , Dextran . Fluorescently labelled dextran uptake was measured in untreated , control treated and EIPA treated cells by flow cytometry . Mean fluorescent intensity of dextran uptake was determined . No statistically significant difference in dextran uptake was observed between control treated and EIPA treated cells despite being a slight reduction but non - significant in dextran uptake observed in EIPA treated cells ( Figure 5 . 11 ( B ) ) . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2083 Figure 5 . 11 A C Figure 5 . 11 Effects of EIPA on BTV infection ( A ) Cellular ATPase of EIPA treated and untreated BFA cells was measured using a luminesence assay and LOG10 data and mean ± SD was plotted . The highest non - toxic concentration was 100µM . ( B ) 100µM was used to test effectiveness in blocking fluid phase uptake . Cells were treated with drug or control treated for 30 minutes and allowed to take up fluid phase uptake positive control ligand , dextran . Fluoresence was measured using flow cytometry and determined from single , live cells . Data was observed in two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate , empty symbols = experiment 1 , solid symbols = experiment 2 . A small but non - significant reduction in dextran uptake is observed in EIPA treated cells . ( C ) The effect of 100µM EIPA on BTV infection was quantified using flow cytometry and virus antibody labelling . The % of infected cells was determined from single , live cells . Two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate are displayed , empty symbols = experiment 1 and solid symbols = experiment 2 . EIPA pre - treated cells and cells treated 1 , 2 and 3 hpi observed significant inhibitory effect on BTV infection when compared to control treated cells . No significant inhibition in BTV infection was observed in cells treated at 6 hpi . B Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 2093 To identify whether EIPA had an effect on of BTV infection , cells were either pre - treated and then infected , or treated at different time points post infection with EIPA . Cell cultures that were either pre - treated or treated 1 , 2 or 3 hours post infection , displayed a highly significant inhibition in the number of cells infected compared to the control treated cells at the equivalent time point ( ANOVA with Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = < 0 . 0005 and p = 0 . 008 , respectively ) . However , when cells were treated with the drug at 6 hours post infection , the reduction in infection observed in EIPA treated cells compared to the control treated cells from the same time point was not significant ( Figure 5 . 11 ( C ) ) . This suggests that the NHE1 is required for an early step in BTV infection , most likely entry . 5 . 5 . 3 BTV infection in BFA cells requires PAK1 IPA - 3 is a small molecule inhibitor of p21 activated protein kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) . PAK1 is one of the most important kinases required for macropinocytosis ( Deacon et al . , 2008 ) . It is known to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics after being activated by Rac1 or Cdc42 and then relocates to the plasma membrane where it activates effectors for ruffling , blebbing and macropinosome formation and aids macropinosome closure by activating CtBP - 1 ( Dharmawardhane et al . , 2000 , Dharmawardhane et al . , 1999 , Dharmawardhane et al . , 1997 , Liberali et al . , 2008 ) . IPA - 3 causes macropinocytosis inhibition by binding to regulatory domain of PAK1 and subsequently prevents the activator Cdc42 from binding and activating PAK1 , which therefore prevents PAK1 from relocating to the plasma membrane ( Deacon et al . , 2008 ) . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 210 A B C Figure 5 . 12 Figure 5 . 12 Effects of IPA - 3 on BTV infection ( A ) Cellular ATPase of IPA - 3 tre ated and untreated BFA cells were measured using a luminesence assay and LOG10 data and mean ± SD was plotted as seen . The highest non - toxic concentration was 100µM . ( B ) 100µM was used to test effectiveness in blocking fluid phase uptake . Cells were treated with drug or control treated for 30 minutes and allowed to take up fluid phase uptake positive control ligand , dextran . Fluoresence was measured using flow cytometry and determined from single , live cells . IPA - 3 pre - treated cells did not show a significant difference in dextran uptake compared to control - treated cells . ( C ) The effect of 100µM IPA - 3 on BTV infection was quantified using flow cytometry and virus antibody labelling . The % of infected cells were determined from single , live cells . Two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate are displayed , empty symbols = experiment 1 and solid symbols = experiment 2 . EIPA pre - treated cells and cells treated 1 , 2 and 3 hpi observed significant inhibitory effect on BTV infection when compared to control treated cells . No significant inhibition in BTV infection was observed in cells treated at 6 hpi . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 211 IPA - 3 concentrations ranging from 3 . 25 to 400µM were tested on BFA cells for a total of 12 . 5 hours to determine toxicity limits of the drug . This showed that concentrations above 100µM were toxic to BFA cells and so a maximum concentration of 100µM was used for all further experiments ( Figure 5 . 12 ( A ) ) The effect of IPA - 3 on macropinocytosis was measured by using the fluid phase marker , dextran as a positive control . The uptake of the fluorescently labelled dextran was measured using flow cytometry and the mean fluorescent intensity was determined . Although a small inhibition in dextran uptake was observed in IPA - 3 treated cells compared to control treated cells , this difference was not statistically significant ( Figure 5 . 12 ( B ) ) . The effect of IPA - 3 on BTV infection was then quantified using flow cytometry . BFA cells were either pre - treated with IPA - 3 or control treated or were treated at 1 , 2 , 3 or 6 hours post infection to determine the effects on infection . A significant inhibition of BTV infection was observed in IPA - 3 treated cells that were either pre - treated or treated at 1 , 2 or 3 hours post infection compared to their matched control treated control ( ANOVA , Tukeys correction , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = 0 . 0005 , p = 0 . 001 , respectively ) ( Figure 5 . 12 ( C ) ) . However , the level of infection recovers the later the drug is added post infection . This suggests that PAK1 is required for BTV infection and is consistent with the time of virus entry observed in section 5 . 2 . 1 . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 212 5 . 5 . 4 BTV infection in BFA cells require rho protein signalling Many viruses are known to manipulate rho protein signalling at different times during virus replication , such as , virus entry and egress ( Van den Broeke et al . , 2014 ) . Rho protein signalling is known to play a role in many endocytosis pathways , such as CME , caveolae dependent endocytosis , phagocytosis and macropinocytosis . Specifically , rho proteins play a crucial role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton , and viruses are often able to manipulate rho protein signalling for internalisation via actin dependent mechanisms such as macropinocytosis and phagocytosis ( Van den Broeke et al . , 2014 ) . Herpes Simples Virus - 1 and Dengue virus have been shown to activate formation of actin filopodia through rho protein , cdc42 and rac1 signalling ( Zamudio - Meza et al . , 2009 , Oh et al . , 2010 ) . Rac1 is also known to be responsible for the formation of the three types of characteristic membrane ruffles associated with macropinocytosis , lamellipodia - like , circular ruffle or membrane blebs ( Ridley et al . , 1992 , Mercer and Helenius , 2008 ) ( see Chapter 1 , section 1 . 13 . 1 ) . Therefore , as part of the investigation in to whether BTV was utilizing macropinocytosis as a possible entry mechanism , the role of rho proteins were investigated by using the rho protein inhibitor , exoenzyme C3 from Clostridium botulinum ( C3 Toxin ) . The C3 toxin is known to cause ADP - ribosylation of Rho G - proteins . Evidences have shown that Rho proteins regulate cytoskeletal activity and inhibition of Rho via C3 toxin inhibits focal adhesion and actin stress fibre formation ( Ridley and Hall , 1992b , Kozma et al . , 1995 , Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . C3 has also shown to completely abolish actin microfilaments in VERO cells and subsequently cause actinmorphic shape of cells ( Chardin et al . , 1989 ) . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 213 Doubling dilutions of C3 toxin ( 0 . 125µg / ml to 4µg / ml ) were tested on BFA cells for 12 . 5 hours and the cellular ATPase measured to identify toxicity . This showed no toxic effects at any of the concentrations used ( Figure 5 . 13 ( A ) ) . A concentration of 1µg / ml was used for subsequent experiments . Cells were treated with 1µg / ml C3 toxin or control treatment ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 9 . 1 , Table 2 . 2 for details of control treatment ) 30 minutes and then chased with 0 . 5mg / ml dextran . No statistical significant difference was seen for dextran uptake in control treated and C3 toxin treated cells ( Figure 5 . 13 ( B ) ) . Although , rho protein signalling is not an essential cellular factor required for all forms of macropinocytosis ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) , therefore the effect on dextran uptake may be due to the fact that rho protein signalling is not required for dextran form of macropinocytosis . Pre - treatment of cells with C3 toxin showed a statistically significant inhibition in infection when compared to the control treated control . However , all treatments post infection saw no significant inhibition in infection ( Figure 5 . 13 ( C ) ) , suggesting that , rho protein signalling is required at an early stage of infection . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 214 Figure 5 . 13 Figure 5 . 13 Effects of C3 toxin on BTV infection ( A ) Cellular ATPase of C3 toxin treated and untreated BFA cells was measured using a luminesence assay and LOG10 data and mean ± SD was plotted . The highest non - toxic concentration was 4µg / ml . ( B ) 1µg / ml was used to test effectiveness in blocking fluid phase uptake .

The effect of Wortmannin on cellular ATPase activity was investigated by exposing cells to Wortmannin concentrations ranging from 6 . 25nM to 800nM for 12 . 5 hours and measuring cell metabolism as above . Wortmannin displayed no toxic effects on BFA cells when used at nM concentrations ( Figure 5 . 14 ( A ) ) . 200nM concentration was selected for future experiments . The effect of Wortmannin on dextran uptake was investigated . There was no significant difference in dextran uptake between control treated and Wortmannin treated cells ( Figure 5 . 14 ( B ) ) . As PI3 kinase has been heavily implicated in macropinocytosis , it is possible that the drug is not successfully inhibiting PI3 kinase in BFA cells at a 200nM concentration . Cells that were either pre - treated or treated post infection with 200nM Wortmannin displayed no significant effect on BTV infection ( Figure 5 . 14 ( C ) ) . This could suggest that , PI3 kinase is not required for BTV infection . However , as the drug showed little effect at inhibiting to control ligand , it is more likely that the drug was ineffective at inhibiting PI3 kinase at the tested concentration of 200nM .

Myosin II is a cellular motor protein that is known to localise to membrane ruffles formed during macropinocytosis ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) and is believed to aid macropinosome closure ( Jiang et al . , 2010 , Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . Blebbistatin functions by preferentially binding to ADP and phosphate bound at the active site of myosin , which in turn blocks the myosin heads in a complex causing myosin II to have low affinity with actin and thus preventing the motorised movement of actin via myosin II ( Kovacs et al . , 2004 ) . A range of Blebbistatin concentrations ( 1 . 875µM to 240µM ) were tested on BFA cells for a total of 12 . 5 hours and cellular ATPase activity of the cells . It was identified that no concentration tested adversely affected cellular ATPase activity ( Figure 5 . 15 ( A ) ) indicating that the inhibitor was not toxic to BFA cells at the concentrations tested . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 218 Figure 5 . 15 Figure 5 . 15 Effects of Blebbistatin on BTV infection ( A ) Cellular ATPase of Blebbistatin tre ated and untreated BFA cells were measured using a luminesence assay and LOG10 data and mean ± SD was plotted as seen . The highest non - toxic concentration was 240µM . ( B ) 50µM was used to test effectiveness in blocking fluid phase uptake . Cells were treated with drug or control treated for 30 minutes and allowed to take up fluid phase uptake positive control ligand , dextran . Fluoresence was measured using flow cytometry and determined from single , live cells . Blebbistatin pre - treated cells presented no significant inhibition of dextran uptake compared to control - treated cells and this was observed in two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate , empty symbols = experiment 1 , solid symbols = experiment 2 . ( C ) The effect of 50µM Blebbistatin on BTV infection was quantified using flow cytometry and virus antibody labelling . The % of infected cells were determined from single , live cells . Two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate are displayed , empty symbols = experiment 1 and solid symbols = experiment 2 . Blebbistatin pre - treated and post - infection treated cells observed no significant inhibitory effect on BTV infection when compared to control treated cells . A B C Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 219 BFA cells pre - treated with 50µM Blebbistatin displayed no significant difference in dextran uptake when compared to control treated cells ( Figure 5 . 15 ( B ) ) indicating that Blebbistatin is not preventing the uptake of dextran Pre - treatment and treatment of cells post infection with 50µM blebbistatin do not effect BTV infection when compared to the control treated controls of the same time point of inhibitor addition ( Figure 5 . 15 ( C ) ) . However , as dextran was not inhibited at this concentration , it may suggest that the drug at 50μM was insufficient at inhibiting myosin II . Although , myosin II is not an essential cellular requirement for macropinocytosis and it is possible that uptake of dextran does not require myosin II . 5 . 5 . 7 BTV stimulates fluid phase uptake in BFA cells Macropinocytosis is constitutively active in some cells such as dendritic cells ( West et al . , 2000 ) . However , macropinocytosis can also be triggered by extracellular factors that activate signalling cascades that culminate in the generation of the classical membrane ruffling and macropinosome formation . Some viruses that utilize macropinocytosis for entry stimulate a transient elevation in fluid phase uptake which could be due to induction of macropinocytosis , ( Mercer and Helenius , 2008 ) . Phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) is known to stimulate macropinocytosis and increases fluid phase uptake ( Swanson , 1989 , Garcia - Perez et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , PMA can be used to induce macropinocytosis . BFA cells were control treated or treated with 1ug / mL PMA for 15 minutes and then incubated with 0 . 5mg / ml AlexaFluor - 647 labelled dextran . Cells were also pre - treated with BTV for 15 minutes and then incubated with labelled dextran as above . Two experiments Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 220 were carried out in triplicate and the mean fluorescent intensity of dextran quantified by flow cytometry ( Figure 5 . 16 ) . Statistically significant increases in the uptake of dextran was seen in both PMA and BTV stimulated cells when compared to the control cells ( ANOVA p = < 0 . 05 p = < 0 . 05 , respectively ) indicating that , BTV transiently stimulates fluid phase uptake in BFA cells . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 221 Figure 5 . 16 Figure 5 . 16 Effects of BTV - 1 stimulation of BFA cells on fluid phase uptake Two repeat experiments carried out in triplicate are displayed in the graph , empty symbols represent experiment 1 and solid symbols experiment 2 . BFA cells were either stimulated with the macropinosome stimulator drug PMA , BTV - 1 or the matched diluent and then cells were chased with fluorescently labelled dextran . Dextran uptake was quantified using flow cytometry and ascertained from single , live cells . Cells that were stimulated with either PMA or BTV - 1 saw a significant increase in dextran uptake compared to the matched controls ( ANOVA p = < 0 . 05 ) . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 222 5 . 6 Discussion This chapter investigated the effects of DN proteins and specific pharmacological inhibitors of cellular factors required for different endocytosis mechanisms on BTV infection of BFA cells using a purified low insect cell passage field isolate virus . The use of flow cytometry allowed quantitative analysis of the effects of inhibitors at the early stages of infection without bias or inclusion of dead cells or cell aggregates by utilizing gating strategies for analysing single , live cell populations . This is the first time cell entry has been investigated for a field isolate of BTV using cells derived from a natural host . The evidence presented in this chapter is consistent with previous reports that BTV uses a macropinocytosis - like entry mechanism ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) for productive BTV infection in BFA cells . Previous publications have investigated entry mechanisms of cell culture adapted BTV in non - host derived cells and their findings have indicated that BTV may be able to use more than one entry pathway ( Forzan et al . , 2007 , Gold et al . , 2010 ) . Although the main conclusions reached regarding the entry mechanisms used by cell culture adapted viruses were different , there were some common findings . Both studies demonstrated that BTV requires a low pH dependent step for infection and both agree that virus entry is independent of cholesterol . The main difference was one study concluded entry was via CME ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) while the other identified a macropinocytosis – like pathway as the main entry pathway ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . The entry kinetics of purified low insect cell passaged BTV - 1 was shown to be relatively slow in BFA cells . Treatment with ammonium chloride pre - infection , a drug that is able to Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 223 raise endosomal pH , identified a significant inhibition in BTV - 1 infection ( approximately a 60 % drop in cells infected ) in BFA cells when compared to untreated cells . This observation suggests that the major entry mechanism used by BTV - 1 requires a low pH dependent step ( see section 5 . 2 ) to allow productive infection . Furthermore , the level of inhibition is consistent with the decrease in infection seen by Forzan and colleagues ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . The observation that ammonium chloride added to cells 1 hour post infection still significantly reduced the percentage of cells infected further demonstrated that BTV - 1 has a relatively slow rate of delivery to acidic compartments ( section 5 . 2 ) . Together these observations suggest a non clathrin - mediated uptake mechanism . The rate of delivery observed ( 60 minutes for 50 % of virus to be delivered to an acidic compartment ) is comparable to that observed by ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) using mammalian cell culture adapted BTV - 1 and BHK - 21 cells . Entry was also studied by visualising entry steps by confocal microscopy . Internalisation of BTV - 1 to the cytosol was not observed until 90 minutes post entry ( section 5 . 2 . 1 ) and this confirmed entry mechanisms utilized by purified BTV - 1 particles display slow internalisation . CME is often described as a mechanism able to deliver rapid internalisation of cargo , often within 10 minutes ( Berryman et al . , 2005 ) and so this entry mechanism , appeared an unlikely cell entry route for BTV into BFA cells . To further support the suggestion that BTV utilizes a clathrin - independent entry mechanism , known inhibitors of CME ( i . e . Chlorpromazine , Pitstop 2 ) and DN proteins eps15 were used . Chlorpromazine was used by ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) to conclude that BTV entered cells via CME . For the studies presented here the highest non - toxic concentration Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 224 of Chlorpromazine for BFA cells 10µg / mL was used . This concentration is the same as used by ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) and other endocytosis studies ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 , Berryman et al . , 2005 ) . However , when used at this concentration Chlorpromazine did not appear to inhibit transferrin uptake . Interestingly , Forzan and colleagues did not present the effect of Chlorpromazine on the control ligand , transferrin as supporting evidence and so the Chlorpromazine data presented in this publication should be viewed with caution ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . Transferrin is an established positive control ligand for CME ( Harding et al . , 1983 , Harding and Stahl , 1983 , Hanover et al . , 1984 , Hopkins , 1985 , Hopkins et al . , 1985 ) and so a lack of inhibition suggests a failure of the drug to inhibit the CME at the tested concentration . Despite this , this line of enquiry was pursued as the publication from ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) used Chlorpromazine as the key piece of evidence that BTV used a CME mechanism . It was observed that Chlorpromazine significantly inhibited BTV infection upon pre - treatment of the cells with this drug but not upon treatment post infection , which was observed in three independent experiments . This indicated that the inhibition to infection was most likely acting upon a step before BTV entry , as demonstrated in section 5 . 3 . 1 . BTV does not enter the cytosol until 90 minutes post infection . However , as Chlorpromazine did not inhibit transferrin uptake we cannot be sure the drug is inhibiting CME and any effect on BTV infection could be an indicator of off - target non - specific effects on the cell . An alternative explanation is that clathrin is also used in a number of trafficking events ( Sousa and Lafer , 2015 ) and so the inhibition in infection observed pre - entry could be effects on the trafficking of the viruses’ receptor to the cell surface . However , as the receptor of BTV is unknown , this theory could not be tested . In order to clarify the requirement of clathrin for BTV infection further , another chemical inhibitor of clathrin , Pitstop 2 , was used to determine the role that clathrin plays in BTV Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 225 infection . The results show that non - toxic concentrations of Pitstop 2 ( 30µM ) inhibited transferrin uptake indicating that the drug was inhibiting CME . Interestingly , this concentration did not inhibit BTV infection during pre or post infection treatments , contrary to what was observed with Chlorpromazine treatments both in this study and by the ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) study . This suggests that BTV does not require CME for infection of BFA cells . To further investigate the role of CME in BTV infection , over expression of GFP - tagged DN mutants of eps15 were used . Eps15 is an initiation factor required for clathrin coated pit formation , ( see Chapter 1 , section 1 . 11 . 1 ) ( Benmerah et al . , 1999 ) . Expression of DN eps15 inhibited uptake of transferrin , indicating that the constructs were successfully inhibiting CME . Infection studies of BTV in combination with different control or DN eps15 mutant plasmids showed that when BFA cells were transfected with any construct ( controls or DN mutants ) the expressing cell populations showed less infection compared to the non - expressing cell population in the same sample . It has been documented that use of some liposomal transfection reagents can induce interferon and cellular stress responses ( Li et al . , 1998 , Fiszer - Kierzkowska et al . , 2011 ) , which could in turn inhibit BTV infection . However , these cell responses would usually impact on bystander cells too but in this study it appeared that only transfected gene expressing cells inhibited infection . Intracellular DNA sensors , such as IFI16 , are known to induce production of interferon - β ( Unterholzner et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , IFI16 is also known to act as a viral restriction factor in human cytomegalovirus infection ( Gariano et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , upregulation of such DNA sensors after transient transfection may restrict viral replication . However , investigating this possibility was not in the scope of this PhD . Despite this , when infection of cell populations expressing the control constructs were compared directly with the cells expressing a DN eps15 construct , no significant difference in BTV infection was observed Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 226 indicating , that eps15 activity was not required for BTV infection . These results further support the conclusion that BTV infection is independent of CME . In agreement with previous studies ( Forzan et al . , 2007 , Gold et al . , 2010 ) , cholesterol seemed not required for BTV infection of BFA cells . However , although not statistically significant , small decreases in infection were observed between control cells and those treated with methy - β - cyclodextrin prior to and 1 hour post BTV infection . It is known that cholesterol is required for membrane rearrangements ( e . g . membrane curvature ) , to give essential membrane fluidity needed in many endocytosis events ( Grimmer et al . , 2002 ) . The timing of the small decreases in infection could reflect the time with which membrane rearrangements are likely to occur during BTV entry . However , as there is no statistical significance it is difficult to conclude whether there is a minor role for cholesterol during virus entry . Observations made during BTV entry experiment ( section 5 . 2 . 1 ) suggested that entry was accompanied by a major rearrangement of actin . The F - actin cytoskeletal structure could clearly be seen at the cell periphery in cells negative for BTV labelling , however , the actin rich cortex was lost in BTV positive cells ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . Furthermore , in BTV positive cells actin labelling appeared more intense and disorganised in the cytosol . This suggested that actin reorganisation could play a role during BTV infection . This is not an unusual observation and many studies report actin rearrangements during virus cell entry . For example HIV - 1 induces F - actin rearrangements Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 227 upon virus binding to CD4 / CXCR4 complex during entry into CD4 positive T cells ( Gordon - Alonso et al . , 2013 ) . Also , Japanese Encephalitis Virus binds to neuronal cells and triggers rapid actin rearrangements to facilitate virus entry ( Kalia et al . , 2013 ) . To confirm the requirement of actin during BTV infection and to ensure actin rearrangements were not an artefact due to the requirement of high m . o . i . to allow visualisation of virus entry , the actin inhibitor Cytochalaisin D was used to identify whether it could inhibit BTV infection at lower m . o . i . ( m . o . i . < 1 ) . Figure 5 . 7 show that Cytochalaisin D caused actin disruption . When cells were pre - treated with Cytochalasin D or treated at 1 or 2 hours post infection , a significant inhibition of cell becoming infected with BTV was observed when compared to the control treated controls . This coincides with the time it takes for virus to be internalised and suggests that actin plays a key role during BTV entry . The confocal images also suggest that BTV is closely associated with F - actin structure during entry . These results suggest that actin is a key cellular factor during BTV entry . However , actin is known to be involved in many endocytosis pathways including CME , caveolae / lipid raft dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis ( Smythe and Ayscough , 2006 ) . Evidence presented in this chapter suggests that the requirement of F - actin during BTV infection is not linked to CME or cholesterol . Therefore , macropinocytosis was investigated to identify any role in BTV infection . The two key cellular indicators , which many attribute as sole discriminators of macropinocytic endocytosis are the requirement of sodium proton exchangers and PAK1 ( Deacon et al . , 2008 ) . To investigate the NHE1 and PAK1 in BTV infection , inhibitors EIPA which inhibit NHE1 and IPA - 3 which , inhibits PAK1 ( Deacon et al . , 2008 ) were used . Upon Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 228 pre - treatment or treatment at 1 , 2 or 3 hours post infection with either of these drugs , a highly significant inhibition in infection compared to control treatment was observed . These results are consistent with the slow entry mechanism observed in both confocal experiments and the rate of delivery of virus to acidic compartments ( section 5 . 2 ) . However , neither inhibitor inhibited dextran uptake , a marker for fluid phase uptake / macropinocytosis . As dextran is a marker of fluid phase uptake and not specifically macropinocytosis , this could suggest that most dextran uptake occurs by mechanisms that are not inhibited by the drugs or that inhibition of macropinocytosis stimulates uptake of dextran by compensating endocytosis mechanisms . Together , these results suggest that BTV utilizes a macropinocytosis - like entry mechanism . The results reported in this Chapter also indicate that BTV has the ability to trigger up - regulation of fluid phase uptake ( section 5 . 5 . 7 ) , in much the same manner as macropinosome stimulating drug PMA ( Garcia - Perez et al . , 2012 , Yoshida et al . , 2015 ) . This suggests that BTV may trigger signalling events and macropinocytosis during entry . This could include induction of filopodia extensions which protrude from the cell and are involved in ‘seeking’ virions that are in close proximity to cells , such as that seen with Human Papillomavirus ( Smith et al . , 2008 ) . Other possibilities include activation of RhoA induced phagocytosis as seen with HSV ( Clement et al . , 2006 ) . Often Rho proteins ( RhoA , Rac1 or Cdc42 ) are involved in initiating signalling cascades that are required for induction of increased virion uptake ( Van den Broeke et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , the role of Rho proteins in BTV infection was also investigated . Flow cytometry analysis of cell pre - treated with c3 toxin from Clostridium botulinum , a known rho protein inhibitor ( Chardin et al . , 1989 ) , exhibited a significant decrease in BTV Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 229 infection when compared to the control treatment . However , cells that were treated at 1 , 2 , 3 or 6 hours post infection did not see a decrease in infection . This indicated that Rho protein signalling is activated prior to virion internalisation , which occurs from 90 minutes post virus attachment . Pre - entry engagement of rho protein signalling has been described to be used by many viruses including retroviruses , papillomaviruses , herpesviruses , poxviruses , dengue virus and vesicular stomatis virus ( Van den Broeke et al . , 2014 ) . The three main mechanisms governed by Rho protein signalling that occur pre - entry are virus surfing down actin filopodia extensions to the cell body as seen with murine leukemia virus ( Lehmann et al . , 2005 ) and HPV ( Schelhaas et al . , 2012 ) , receptor clustering to virus ‘hot spots’ at the cell periphery to facilitate entry as seen with HPV ( Smith et al . , 2008 ) and HIV ( Yoder et al . , 2008 , Iyengar et al . , 1998 , Jimenez - Baranda et al . , 2007 ) and the last mechanism is filopodia extensions which ‘seek’ virions close to but not bound to the target cell as seen with HSV ( Clement et al . , 2006 ) . Observations during BTV entry ( section 5 . 2 . 1 ) identified small filopodia like - actin rich structures protruding from the cell at point of virus attachment , with virions often bound to the apical tips of these extensions and by 30 minutes uptake , virus could be seen at the periphery of the cell body ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . In addition , virus clustering at specific locations could be seen after 1 hour virus uptake . Therefore , viral surfing or virus receptor clustering are possibilities for BTV but further investigation is required for the specific mechanism . It is likely that live cell imaging of virus entry could shed light on whether virus can be seen ‘surfing’ down actin filopodia projections , however , a fluorescently tagged virus is required for such imaging . It is also likely that receptor clustering could be visualised using microscopy but this possibility is difficult when the attachment receptor of BTV in unknown . With this in mind and the understanding that myosin II is often involved in the retraction of actin filopodia projections during virus surfing , the role of myosin II was investigated . Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 230 Myosin II motors are known to drive virus surfing , working with actin filaments to move virions along filopodia ( Van den Broeke et al . , 2014 ) . Blebbistatin is a well characterised inhibitor of Myosin II ( Limouze et al . , 2004 ) and was used in this study to identify whether there is a role for myosin II in BTV infection . Blebbistatin failed to inhibit dextran uptake at the non - toxic concentration of 50µM . However , myosin II whilst is a characteristic for some forms of macropinocytosis , it is not an essential cellular factor for all forms of macropinocytosis ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . However without a suitable control it was impossible to differentiate if Blebbistatin was an effective inhibitor of myosin II For further clarification the effect of Blebbistatin treatment on BTV infection was still investigated . Pre - treatment or post infection treatments with Blebbistatin did not inhibit virus infection when compared to matched control treatments . It is possible that myosin II is not required for virus infection but equally plausible that 50µM is not a sufficient concentration to inhibit myosin II in BFA cells . To draw any firm conclusions , a better control to identify whether myosin II has effectively been inhibited is required . In addition , as toxicity of this drug was low at higher concentration than 50µM , higher concentrations of the drug could be tested to see whether this induces myosin II inhibition . Phosphoinositide ( PI ) 3 - kinase ( PI3 - kinase ) is a kinase that is frequently cited as being involved in macropinocytic entry of viruses and in the transient formation of actin filopodia extensions during HPV entry ( Smith et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore the PI3 kinase inhibitor , Wortmannin was used to identify whether PI3 kinase plays a role in BTV infection . Nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin inhibit PI3 kinase , higher concentrations of the drug then inhibit PI4 kinase and so a concentration of 200nM was selected as it has been highly cited as being the maximum concentration effective against PI3 kinase alone ( Park et al . , 1997 ) . Wortmannin did not inhibit dextran uptake of infection at any of the time Chapter 5 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 231 points tested . This could suggest that BTV is entering independent of PI3 kinase but without an effective answer as to whether the drug is inhibiting PI3 kinase in these cells ( due to lack of inhibition of the dextran control ) , it is difficult to draw conclusions . The evidence presented in this chapter demonstrate that entry and infection of BFA cells with a purified , low insect cell passaged BTV - 1 is independent of CME and share many characteristics of macropinocytosis . BTV - 1 appears to initiate rho protein signalling prior to virus entry , which subsequently results in cell signalling that triggers global actin reorganisation and a transient increase in fluid phase uptake , which appears to be directly stimulated by the virus itself . In addition , kinases and other cellular factors which are essential for macropinocytosis such as PAK1 and the NHE1 are also essential for productive BTV - 1 infection in BFA cells and appear to be required throughout the process of slow cellular entry by the virus . Taken together , the evidence in this chapter supports conclusions made by Gold et al . ( 2010 ) of macropinocytosis - like BTV - 1 entry in BHK - 21 cells . However , this study could also indicate that the target cell of the virus may influence the entry mechanism used to gain entry . Chapter 6 - Investigating entry mechanisms utilized by BTV in Culicoides spp . cells Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 235 6 . 1 Introduction Endocytosis in insect cells has largely been neglected as a research area with only a handful of publications describing endocytosis of major human arboviruses in mosquito cells ( Lee et al . , 2013 , Chu et al . , 2006 , Acosta et al . , 2011 , Acosta et al . , 2008 ) or the endocytosis of the heavily used laboratory tool ‘Baculovirus’ in Drosophila spp . cells ( Long et al . , 2006 ) . However , in recent years , the emergence of Culicoides - borne viruses such as Schmallenberg virus ( SBV ) and multiple serotypes of BTV , plus the documentation of Oropouche virus , currently the only human midge transmitted virus , strengthens the argument that the virus - vector interactions for Culicoides - borne viruses must be better understood ( Carpenter et al . , 2013 ) . In particular , better understanding of insect cell biology and endocytic processes that govern entry of viruses to their biological vector could elude to unique possibilities of preventing vector infection and thus transmission of arboviruses . In addition , many viruses , including arboviruses have been reported to use multiple entry mechanisms ( Boulant et al . , 2015 ) , although it is unknown if cell entry strategies are governed by the cell type being infected . Therefore , the possibility remains that BTV may adopt different cell - entry strategies in the Culicoides spp . host cells compared to mammalian cellular targets . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 236 The entry of BTV - 1 into Culicoides derived cells ( KC cells ) , was investigated in more detail in this chapter . In chapter 4 , data generated in Culicoides spp . cells identified a dynamin gene in the Culicoides spp . genome and results suggested that dynamin could be involved in BTV infection but could not be confirmed due to the lack of an insect cell characterised positive control ligands . The dynamin - dependent CME pathway has been reported to operate in both Drosophila cell lines ( Chang et al . , 2002 ) and Aedes cell lines ( Acosta et al . , 2008 ) suggesting that CME is an evolutionary conserved endocytic mechanism . As the full Culicoides spp . genome had not been completed or published at the start of this project , the use of siRNA and dominant negative proteins were unable to be used due to the lack of information regarding the vector’s genome . Therefore , the effects of pharmacological inhibitors targeting cellular factors in endocytosis were tested with control ligands and BTV infections were characterised in Culicoides spp . cells . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 237 6 . 2 Investigating the requirement of acidic endosomal pH in BTV infection and the rate of trafficking to acidic compartments within KC cells Many viruses require an acid dependent step ( Grove and Marsh , 2011 ) to initiate infection . The data described in Chapter 5 confirmed that , BTV requires an acid dependent step to initiate infection in bovine endothelial cells and this was also further documented in other mammalian cell lines ( Gold et al . , 2010 , Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , the requirement of an acid - dependent step during BTV infection of KC cells was investigated by treating cells with ammonium chloride . Ammonium chloride neutralises acid compartments ( see Chapter 5 , section 5 . 2 ) . Upon pre - treatment with 25mM Ammonium chloride , BTV - 1 infection of KC cells was significantly inhibited compared to cells that were untreated ( One - Way ANOVA , Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 0005 ) ( Figure 6 . 1 ) . This finding shows that , BTV requires an acid - dependent step during infection of KC cells . The addition of ammonium chloride to cells at different time points post infection allows inference of the rate with which virus reaches an acidic compartment . Statistically significant inhibition of infection was observed in cells treated with ammonium chloride up to 8 hours post infection ( Figure 6 . 1 ) , however the level of significance reduced in accordance with time post infection . This is indicative of a relatively slow process of virus reaching an acidic compartment within the cell . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 238 Figure 6 . 1 Figure 6 . 1 Rate of delivery of BTV to acidic compartments in KC cells KC cells were infected with purified BTV - 1 GIB2007 / 01 KC3 for a total of 16 hours . Ammonium chloride ( 25mM ) was added to cells at different time points during infection : pre - treatment , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 h . p . i . and during the last 5 minutes of infection .

After 2 hours of internalisation , approximately 50 % of virus has been delivered to an acidic compartment .

As a result , information on the reagents and tools that can be used to investigate endocytosis mechanisms in insect cells is limited . Therefore , the potential toxic effects of common pharmacological inhibitors of mammalian cell endocytosis were initially determined for KC cells . KC cells were incubated with one of six inhibitors for a duration of 12 . 5 hours . After incubation , cells were stained with Live / Dead stain ( Life technologies ) . Cells were then fixed and single , live cells were analysed using flow cytometry . Inhibitors were tested at concentrations shown to inhibit target cellular factors in BFA cells and previously published data , concentrations were as follows : EIPA ( 100µM ) , Cytochalasin D ( 10µg / ml ) , IPA 3 ( 150µM ) , Methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( 5mM ) , Wortmannin ( 10µM ) and Pitstop 2 ( 25µM ) . At the end - point of the experiment the only drug which displayed a substantial reduction in cell viability were KC cells incubated with IPA 3 ( Figure 6 . 2 ) . For this reason , IPA 3 was excluded from further experiments . Small but non - significant reductions in cell viability could also be seen in cells incubated with Cytochalasin D and Pitstop 2 . However , as reduction in viability was minimal , these inhibitors were still used to further investigate endocytosis mechanisms utilised in KC cells . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 240 Figure 6 . 2 Toxicity of endocytosis inhibitor on KC cells Cells were treated with one of six possible endocytosis inhibitors for 12 . 5 hours at concentrations shown to be effective in BFA cells and in previously published works . Cell viability was determined by analysing the proportion of single , live cells . Panel ( A ) identifies toxicity data for 100µM EIPA , panel ( B ) displays toxicity data for 10µg / ml Cytochalasin D , panel ( C ) exhibits toxicity data for 150µM IPA 3 , panel ( D ) identifies toxicity data for 5mM methyl - β - cyclodextrin , panel ( E ) depicts toxicity data for 25µM Pitstop - 2 and lastly panel ( F ) shows toxicity data for 10µM Wortmannin . Panel C shows that there is a significant difference in cell viability in cells treated with IPA - 3 compared to mock control treatment and untreated cells ( ANOVA , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = < 0 . 0005 , respectively ) . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 241 6 . 4 The effect of macropinocytosis inhibitors on BTV - 1 infection of KC cells Results presented in Chapter 5 , suggested that BTV might utilize a macropinocytosis - like mechanism to enter bovine endothelial cells . Therefore , pharmacological inhibitors EIPA , which inhibits NHE1 and Cytochalasin D , which inhibits actin , both factors required for macropinocytosis , were used to identify their effects on control ligand uptake and BTV - 1 infection . As IPA - 3 was toxic to KC cells ( see section 6 . 2 ) the role of p21 activated kinase 1 ( PAK1 ) could not be investigated in KC cells . Firstly , the effect of EIPA on control ligand uptake was examined as it was unknown as to whether macropinocytosis operates in the same manner in insect cells as it does in mammalian cells and if so , whether EIPA would act on NHE1 and inhibit macropinocytosis . KC cells were pre - treated with EIPA for 30 minutes or incubated with the equivalent dilution of the drug diluent , DMSO . Cells were then allowed to internalise the fluorescently labelled macropinocytosis / fluid phase uptake marker dextran . After analysis using flow cytometry , it was identified that there was a significant inhibition in dextran uptake in EIPA treated cells compared to control treated and untreated cells ( One - way ANOVA , Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = < 0 . 0005 , respectively ) ( Figure 6 . 3 ( A ) ) , indicating , macropinocytosis had effectively been inhibited with EIPA . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 242 The effects of EIPA on BTV - 1 infection within KC cells were then investigated . KC cells were either pre - treated with EIPA / control treatment or treated at 1 , 2 or 4 hours post infection Cells were labelled for viral proteins after fixation using an anti - virus antibody Orab 276 ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 ) and analysed using flow cytometry . EIPA successfully inhibited uptake of dextran in KC cell , indicating the inhibitor is effective at blocking MPC ( Figure 6 . 3 ( A ) ) ( ANOVA with Tukey’s correction p = < 0 . 0005 ) . Contrary to observation in bovine endothelial cells ( see Chapter 5 , section 5 . 5 . 2 ) no significant effect on percentage of cells infected was observed in KC cell cultures either pre - treated with EIPA or treated at 1 , 2 or 4 hours post infection compared to the matched control treatments ( Figure 6 . 3 ( B ) ) . The effect of actin inhibitor , Cytochalasin D was studied next to identify the effect on control ligand uptake and BTV - 1 infection of KC cells . However , pre - treatment of cells with Cytochalasin D had no effect on dextran uptake ( Figure 6 . 4 ( A ) ) . KC cells were then either pre - treated or treated at 1 or 2 hours post infection with 10µg / ml Cytochalasin D or an equivalent dilution of the drug diluent and the effects on BTV infection was observed . Cells either pre - treated or treated at 1 hour post infection displayed no significant effect on the proportion of cells infected with BTV ( Figure 6 . 4 ( B ) ) . Together , the data generated from EIPA and Cytochalasin D experiments suggests BTV may not use macropinocytosis for entry in KC cells .

EIPA was shown to inhibit macropinocytosis control ligand ( ANOVA , p = < 0 . 0005 ) but has no statistically significant effect on BTV infection at any of the time points for treatment .

Panel ( B ) identifies the effect of pre - treatment or post - infection treatment with EIPA on BTV infection compared to control treated and untreated cells . No significant difference in dextran uptake or BTV infection was observed in cells treated with Cytochalasin D compared to control treatments . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 245 6 . 5 Investigating the role of clathrin in BTV - 1 infection of KC cells As section 6 . 4 identified that BTV infection did not require the cellular factors NHE1 or actin commonly required for macropinocytosis , the role of clathrin in BTV infection of KC cells was further investigated . Pitstop 2 inhibits clathrin ( see Chapter 5 , section 5 . 3 . 2 ) . Initially , the effect of Pitstop 2 on the control ligand , transferrin uptake in KC cells was quantified using flow cytometry . Upon pre - treatment with 25µM Pitstop 2 ( which was selected as was shown as previously effective with BFA cells and in previous publications ) or an equivalent dilution of the drug diluent , DMSO for 15 minutes , cells treated with Pitstop2 exhibited a highly significant decrease in transferrin uptake compared to control treatment and untreated cells ( One - Way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 0005 , p = < 0 . 0005 , respectively ) ( Figure 6 . 5 A ) . The role of clathrin in BTV - 1 infection of KC cells was then investigated . Cells were either pre - treated with 25µM Pitstop 2 or the equivalent dilution of DMSO ore treated at 1 , 2 or 3 hours post infection with Pitstop 2 / control treatment . The level of infection after 12 hours was detected using an anti - virus antibody , orab 276 , and viral protein expression quantified using flow cytometry ( see Chapter 2 , section 2 . 7 ) . Statistically significant reductions in BTV - 1 infection could be observed in cells with pre - treated or treated at 1hpi compared to matched control treatments ( One - Way ANOVA , Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 005 , p = < 0 . 05 , respectively ) but no significant difference in population of cells infected was observed in Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 246 cells treated at 2 or 3 hpi ( Figure 6 . 5 ( B ) ) . This suggests that clathrin may play a role in the early events of BTV infection of KC cells . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 247 Figure 6 . 5 The effects of clathrin inhibitor , Pitstop - 2 on BTV - 1 infection and control ligand uptake in KC cells KC cells were either pre - treated with 25µM Pitstop - 2 or an equivalent dilution of drug diluent , DMSO and then allowed to internalise fluorescently labelled 10µg / ml transferrin for 15 minutes .

Figure 6 . 5 A B Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 248 6 . 6 The effect of Cholesterol inhibitors on BTV - 1 infection of KC cells To determine if BTV - 1 utilizes more than one entry mechanism for KC cells , the role of cholesterol in BTV infection was investigated . Due to time restrictions , only one experiment was carried out in triplicate . Cells were either pre - treated with 5mM Methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( see Chapter 5 , section 5 . 4 . 1 ) or the equivalent dilution of drug diluent , serum free media for 30 minutes . Cells were then infected with BTV - 1 for 12 hours and labelled for viral proteins using an anti - virus antibody , orab 276 as previously described ( see Appendix C ) . A small but non - significant reduction in BTV infection was observed in MβCD treated cells compared to both control treatment and untreated cells ( Figure 6 . 6 ) . 6 . 7 The effect of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase inhibitors on BTV - 1 infection of KC cells The role of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 Kinase ) and phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase ( PI4 Kinase ) in BTV - 1 infection was investigated in KC cells PI3 - kinase is known to be a critical kinase during macropinocytosis ( Araki et al . , 1996 , Simonsen et al . , 2001 ) , PI4 - kinase is thought to be required for phospholipid metabolism and endocytic trafficking ( Simonsen et al . , 2001 ) . PI3 kinase and some forms of PI4 kinase are inhibited by Wortmannin at μM concentrations ( Simonsen et al . , 2001 ) . Due to time constraints , only a single experiment was carried out in triplicate . KC cells that were pre - treated with 10µM Wortmannin displayed a significant inhibition in BTV - 1 infection in KC cells compared to the control treated and untreated cells ( One - Way ANOVA , p = < 0 . 005 , p = < 0 . 005 , respectively ( Figure 6 . 7 ) . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 249 Figure 6 . 6 Figure 6 . 6 The effects of methyl - β - cyclodextrin pre - treatment on BTV - 1 infection of KC cells KC cells were pre - treated with 5mM methyl - β - cyclodextrin or an equivalent of the drug diluent , serum free media for 30 minutes .

Data is from one experiment carried out in triplicate .

A significant reduction can be seen in cells treated with the drug compared to control treatment or untreated cells ( One - way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction , p = < 0 . 005 , p = < 0 . 005 , respectively ) . Data is from one experiment carried out in triplicate . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 251 6 . 8 Discussion The endocytosis mechanisms used by viruses are relatively well characterised in mammalian cells ( Pelkmans and Helenius , 2003 , Sieczkarski and Whittaker , 2002 ) but few studies have documented entry of viruses in insect cells and endocytosis pathways have so far not been studies in Culicoides derived KC cells . The novel data generated in this chapter details the first investigation of BTV endocytosis in KC cells , which may generate knowledge to inform future control strategies . To dissect the entry route of BTV in KC cells a diverse range of pharmacological inhibitors targeting cellular factors known to be required for distinct endocytic pathways were used . BTV - 1 infection was significantly inhibited ( 65 % reduction ) when KC cells were pre - treated with ammonium chloride , a drug , which immediately raises endosomal pH ( Figure 6 . 1 ) . This indicated that delivery of BTV - 1 to an acidic compartment was required to initiate infection in Culicoides spp . cells . The requirement of low pH - dependent step is described for many non - enveloped viruses and enveloped viruses , which use endocytosis as an entry route ( Grove and Marsh , 2011 ) . In the field of insect endocytosis , Dengue Virus , Chikungunya virus and West Nile Virus have been described to require a low pH step when using a clathrin - mediated entry mechanism in Aedes albopictus mosquito cells ( Acosta et al . , 2011 , Acosta et al . , 2008 , Chu et al . , 2006 , Lee et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , Baculovirus entering sf21 ( Spodoptera frugiperda ) cells via a clathrin - dependent manner were also found to require an acid - dependent step to allow infection ( Long et al . , 2006 ) . Addition of ammonium chloride at different time points post infection revealed that delivery of the virus to an acidic compartment is an extremely slow process ( Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 252 Figure 6 . 1 ) . Statistically significant levels of infection inhibition were observed even up to addition of ammonium chloride at 8 hours post infection . KC cells are propagated at 28°C and therefore , all entry experiments were carried out at this temperature . With the requirement of many different enzymes for both endocytosis mechanisms and trafficking , it is impossible to rule out that the low temperature these experiments were conducted in could slow enzymatic activity and therefore entry and trafficking processes . GTPases are required for both entry and trafficking of endocytic cargo ( Van den Broeke et al . , 2014 , Stenmark , 2009 , Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . GTPase activity in other cellular processes have been reported to be reduced at low temperatures , such as that seen in human guanylate binding protein - 1 ( hGBP - 1 ) , which is a dynamin related GTPase ( Rani et al . , 2012 ) . However , the slow delivery of BTV - 1 to an acidic compartment could also indicate slow endocytosis mechanisms , such as , caveolae - dependent endocytosis or macropinocytsosis . Nevertheless , upon inhibition with non - toxic ( Figure 6 . 2 ( A ) ) , macropinocytosis inhibitor EIPA , no significant effect on BTV - 1 infection was observed either at pre - treatment or post infection treatments ( Figure 6 . 3 ( B ) ) . In addition to this , it was confirmed that EIPA did induce inhibition of dextran uptake , implying macropinocytosis had successfully been inhibited ( Figure 6 . 3 ( A ) ) . Furthermore , pre - treatment or treatment post infection with non - toxic ( Figure 6 . 2 ( B ) ) actin inhibitor Cytochalasin D also had no effect on BTV - 1 infection compared mock treated cells ( Figure 6 . 4 ( B ) ) . The results might indicate that field isolate BTV - 1 can use an alternate endocytosis mechanism in Culicoides spp . cells than what was observed in bovine endothelial cells ( see Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 253 Chapter 5 ) but interestingly , is consistent with the published endocytic mechanism described by Forzan and colleagues ( 2007 ) in HeLa and Vero cells . CME was successfully inhibited in KC cells with non - toxic concentrations of Pitstop 2 ( Figure 6 . 2 ( E ) ) , as confirmed by the statistically significant inhibition in transferrin uptake ( Figure 6 . 5 ( A ) ) . However , it has been reported that whilst transferrin does enter S2 ( Drosophilla spp . cells ) and Sf9 ( Spodoptera frugiperda cells ) cells via a clathrin - dependent route , the ligand remains internalised in cellular compartments for hours and is not recycled back to the plasma membrane as is seen in mammalian cells ( Van Hoof et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , caution must be used when using mammalian cell characterised ligands in insect cells as positive controls . Moreover , upon pre - treatment of KC cells with Pitstop 2 and treatment of cells at 1 hour post infection , a significant decrease in % of cells infected was observed compared to control treated cells ( Figure 6 . 5 ( B ) ) . This suggests that field isolate BTV - 1 infection of KC cells is reliant on clathrin at an early stage of infection , most likely entry . Preliminary data was also generated in this chapter , which focused on the roles of cholesterol and PI4 kinase in BTV - 1 infection of KC cells . Although , no conclusions can be drawn from this data as it was only generated from one experiment in triplicate and does not include control ligand uptake confirmation , it did suggest that while cholesterol may not be a major factor in BTV - 1 infection , PI4 kinase might have a possible role in BTV - 1 replication in KC cells . However , further supporting evidence is required to confirm what the preliminary data suggests . Chapter 6 : Understanding the early events in BTV cell entry 254 In conclusion , data presented in this chapter suggests that BTV - 1 may utilize a pH and clathrin - dependent mechanism for infection in KC cells . However , confirmatory experiments with alternative pharmacological inhibitors of clathrin or expression of DN eps15 should be used to further validate the observations presented in this chapter . Chapter 7 – Final Discussion and Future Work Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 257 7 . 1 Final Discussion and Future Work BTV has evolved to replicate in ruminant and insect hosts ; how BTV achieves replication in these widely different species is poorly understood . Replication begins with virus binding to attachment receptors at the plasma membrane of target cells , which initiates infection and it is likely that the receptors and the entry pathway used by BTV are different for mammalian and insect cells . Target cells of BTV include endothelial cells and a subset of leukocytes cells in the ruminant host and the midgut cells , fat body cells and salivary glands of the midge . Following initial virus infections and once viral replication develops in the mammalian host and insect vector , the major particle type present is likely to be whole virions . Therefore , this thesis focuses on identifying the cell entry pathway used by intact BTV to infect host derived target cells from the ruminant host and insect vector cells . Previous studies in this area have used cell culture adapted BTV strains and standard mammalian cell lines derived from non - host species . Therefore , the aim of this thesis was to elucidate cell entry mechanisms utilised by a low passage KC cell generated field isolate BTV - 1 in host derived cells ( BFA and KC cells ) . Furthermore , the virus used in this study was purified to eliminate the potential for cellular factors ( possibly present in infected cell lysates ) that may influence the uptake pathway . This thesis has identified the endocytosis mechanism used by a field isolate of BTV - 1 for entry into BFA cells as a macropinoctosis - like mechanism and presents preliminary evidence for an alternative endocytosis mechanism used by the same virus in KC cells . Thus , BTV - 1 is similar to other viruses and appears to use at least 2 endocytosis mechanisms , which may be dictated by target cell type or host . Furthermore , this thesis has confirmed that dynamin - 2 splice variants appear to be specific for differential Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 258 endocytosis mechanisms and only dynamin - 2 ba splice variant was shown to play a role in BTV - 1 endocytosis , which is the first time an individual dynamin splice variant has been confirmed to be involved in pathogen entry . This is also the first study using a field isolate of BTV , which has not been adapted to mammalian cell culture , to study cell entry . Evidence presented in this thesis ( Chapter 3 ) has also highlighted how cell culture adaptation of BTV may influence infectivity , which could alter receptor binding preference and subsequent entry mechanisms . This thesis details an adapted method of BTV purification that negates the requirement of virus adaptation to mammalian cell culture entirely whilst preserving field isolate genotypic and phenotypic characteristics . Historical BTV purification methods require serial passage of virus in BHK - 21 cells ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) thereby generating purified particle likely to be adapted to mammalian cell culture . This thesis required virus that retained phenotypic characteristics resembling field isolate virus . Therefore , purification methods were adapted to propagate virus in KC cells only , which are cells derived from Culicoides larvae , as described in chapter 3 . In order to identify whether this method would alter genotypic or phenotypic characteristics of the field isolate , BTV was serially passaged in three cell lines and whole genome sequencing of these viruses highlighted possible cell culture adaptation changes , which were then related to the infectivity of these viruses . In chapter 3 , it was identified that viruses that were passaged in KC cells retained the same infectivity as field isolate BTV for mammalian cell culture and low passage KC viruses had infectivity akin to field isolate virus in KC cells . However , virus propagated multiple times in KC cells had enhanced infectivity in KC cells , which were then identified as having genetic changes in a number of segments of the viral genome . Viruses that were passaged in BFA or BHK cells were shown to have enhanced infectivity in mammalian cell culture and these viruses also observed genetic changes in Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 259 virus segments . Upon serial passaging of BTV in three different cell lines , the occurrence of sequence changes could indicate cell culture adaptation had occurred . As only consensus level sequencing was carried out , it would be valuable to assess whether these sequence changes were a result of fixation of a sub consensus level virus sequence in the virus population or the generation of mutations . Follow up work investigating whether the identified sequence changes impact on virus replication and entry would be of interest to future studies on virus host interactions . In addition , investigating the effect of passaging BTV through KC - BFA - KC - BFA cells could highlight a natural development or control of viral mutations . It was concluded that low passage virus generated in KC cells , would retain infectivity similar to the parental field isolate . Furthermore , sequencing of purified virus only identified a single nucleotide change in the whole genome . As this was not in any viral protein known to be required for BTV entry , it was concluded that field isolate entry kinetics would be maintained . BTV was successfully purified after low passage in KC cells from an adapted established method ( Mertens et al . , 1987 ) . This virus was used to investigate the mechanism of endocytosis used by BTV in BFA and KC cells . Previous work studying endocytosis mechanisms of cell culture adapted BTV identified that dynamin may play a role in BTV infection ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . However , whilst a dynamin inhibitor ( Dynasore ) blocked infection , expression of DN Dynamin - 2 aa did not inhibit infection ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) . In chapter 4 , this conundrum was addressed by using additional dynamin inhibitors , siRNA targeting dynamin - 2 and DN dynamin - 2 splice variant proteins . Pre - treatment of BFA cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of dynamin Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 260 ( Dyngo4a ) resulted in an inhibition of infection and blocked BTV entry into cells . siRNA targeting dynamin - 2 and expression of DN dynamin - 2 ba splice variant inhibited BTV infection . In contrast , no inhibition of infection was observed upon expression of DN dynmain - 2 aa and bb . Indicating that , BTV entry and infection is dependent on dynamin - 2 ba splice variant . Theba splice variant of dynamin - 2 has been implicated to play a major role in macropinocytosis which suggested that BTV may also use macropinocytosis for cell entry . In chapter 5 it was then identified that BTV - 1 entry in to BFA cells was slow and took at least 2 hours before virus could be seen in the cell cytoplasm , which suggests that the role dynamin plays in BTV infection occurs prior to virus entry . A slow rate of entry was further supported by demonstrating that virus trafficking to acidic endosomes was also slow ( Chapter 5 ) . It was further identified that BTV - 1 appeared to stimulate enhanced fluid - phase uptake and trigger a global reorganisation of cellular actin . Evidence was also presented that suggests this may be triggered by rho protein signalling . This suggests that BTV may be able to stimulate its own uptake by triggering endocytosis ( e . g . macropinocytosis ) . Rho proteins include Rac1 , cdc42 and Ras , all of which are known to play roles in macropinocytosis ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . Future work should include identification of which rho protein are involved in signalling during BTV entry and elucidate the downstream signalling cascade responsible for actin reorganisation and subsequent enhancement in fluid phase uptake . The observation that accumulation of BTV at the cell surface over time could indicate that rho protein signalling may be initiating receptor clustering , in a similar way to Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 261 what is observed with coxsackievirus B and its receptor ‘coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor’ ( CAR ) ( Coyne and Bergelson , 2005 ) . Due to the early involvement of dynamin in infection , it is possible that dynamin could also act as a signalling molecule , which could work in concert with rho protein signalling to regulate cytoskeletal activity and subsequent enhancement of fluid - phase uptake . Dynamin - 2 has been shown to be recruited to sites of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli attachment to actin rich pedestals of epithelial cells and initiate signalling that is required for pedestal formation and actin polymerisation ( Unsworth et al . , 2007 ) . Dynamin - 2 has also been shown to localise at actin tails generated by Listeria and was shown to control nucleation of actin from membranes ( Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ) . In addition , studies in yeast have identified an important link between dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 , Wendland et al . , 1998 ) . This evidence along with data generated in this thesis suggests that there is a strong functional link between dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton . From evidence presented in this thesis , it is possible that dynamin - 2 ba plays a role at the point of virus attachment , where virus was seen to be in close association with F - actin structures at the cell periphery . Future work should include studies to identify the location of endogenous dynamin - 2 during BTV - 1 attachment and entry to identify whether Dynamin - 2 is recruited to sites of virus attachment . In addition , an experiment to investigate whether inhibition of dynamin - 2 ba inhibits actin rearrangement during BTV - 1 entry to identify whether there is a direct link between this dynamin splice variant and actin during BTV entry . The role of dynamin in actin polymerisation appears to be linked to neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 262 WASP ) – WAVE and actin related protein 2 / 3 ( ARP2 / 3 ) , which along with dynamin have been found to localise at lamellipodia ( Schlunck et al . , 2004 ) , membrane ruffles ( Krueger et al . , 2003 , Gold et al . , 1999 ) , podosomes ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) and actin comets ( Lee and De Camilli , 2002 , Orth et al . , 2002 ) during bacteria cell entry ( Unsworth et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , if proposed studies identify dynamin localisation at sites of BTV attachment and inhibition of dynamin impacts actin reorganisation then the involvement of N - WASP and ARP2 / 3 should also be investigated . Expression of DN dynamin - 2 ba inhibited infection but failed to inhibit transferrin uptake , indicating that BTV entry is dynamin - dependent but independent of clathrin . The role of clathrin in BTV infection was evaluated to confirm this observation and because CME had been previously reported as an endocytosis mechanism used by BTV - 10 in HeLa and VERO cells ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . Pharmacological inhibitors of clathrin ( Chlorpromazine and Pitstop 2 ) were used to identify the involvement of clathrin during BTV infection . As Chlorpromazine was found not to inhibit the CME of the control ligand , transferrin , the results generated for BTV infection might therefore be a result of off target effects of the drug . However , Pitstop 2 inhibited transferrin uptake in BFA cell but did not inhibit BTV - 1 infection , suggesting CME is not required for infection in these cells . Furthermore , expression of DN eps15 ( Eps15 is a clathrin pit initiation factor ) also did not inhibit BTV - 1 infection strengthening the observation that BTV entry and infection occurs independent of clathrin . In addition , depletion of cholesterol using Methyl - β - cyclodextrin also did not inhibit BTV infection , suggesting that virus infection is also cholesterol - independent . One of the most striking characteristics of BTV entry into BFA cells was the slow internalisation of the virus and trafficking to acidic compartments coupled with Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 263 restructuring of the F - actin cytoskeleton to accommodate entry of the virus through the dense actin rich cortex that usually resides at the cell periphery . Furthermore , as mentioned above , inhibition of rho proteins , inhibited BTV infection when cells were pre - treated with C3 toxin but not when cells were treated post infection . This may suggest rho protein signalling may be involved in initiating enhancement of fluid - phase uptake upon virus attachment . In addition , inhibition of macropinocytosis by targeting NHE1 and PAK1 resulted in the inhibition of BTV - 1 infection . Together these observations support the conclusion that BTV uses a macropinocytosis like mechanism to gain entry into BFA cells . Future work could include analysis of the actin reorganisation induced by BTV during attachment and entry by means of live cell microscopy . This would help elucidate the rate of extension and retractions of actin filaments and determine accurate timing of events , particularly if BTV was successfully tagged with a fluorescent probe . Furthermore , studies of the generation of membrane ruffles could be carried out with the use of scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) to identify whether BTV stimulates lamellipodia , circular ruffles or blebs at the plasma membrane during virus internalisation . In addition , further investigation into the trafficking of field isolate BTV to endosomal compartments should be carried out . This study was only able to identify a cross reactive antibody against LAMP1 in bovine cells ( data not shown ) , identification of other reagents that cross react with host derived cells would benefit future virus trafficking investigations . In summary , from evidence generated in Chapters 4 and 5 , using pharmacological inhibitors , siRNA and DN proteins , the proposed model of entry for BTV - 1 in BFA cells is depicted in Figure 7 . 1 , which suggests that BTV - 1 uses a non - canonical , dynamin - dependent macropinocytosis - like entry mechanism is used for cellular entry of BFA cells . Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 264 This thesis also investigated entry of BTV using KC cells . Interestingly , inhibition of BTV - 1 infection of KC cells was not achieved when cells were treated with inhibitors of actin and NHE1 , indicating that BTV - 1 infection is independent of both actin and NHE1 . This suggests that BTV - 1 utilises an alternative route of cell entry in KC cells . Chapter 6 presented preliminary evidence , which suggested that entry for KC cells is clathrin - dependent . This is further supported by the inhibitory effect of dynamin inhibitors on BTV infection ( Chapter 4 ) . These observations suggest that a clathrin - dependent entry mechanism is used for BTV - 1 entry in KC cells . It is possible that the different entry pathways used by BTV to infect mammalian and KC cells results from differences in receptor usage . For example , it is known that BTV core particles can bind to KC cells via VP7 but this does not occur in mammalian cells ( Tan et al . , 2001 ) , which could influence the activation of alternative endocytosis mechanisms . Interestingly , current literature suggests that all virus triggered endocytosis mechanisms identified in insect cells have been via CME ( Acosta et al . , 2011 , Lee et al . , 2013 , Mosso et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that this may be an endocytosis mechanism used specifically for virus trafficking in insects . Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 265 Figure 7 . 1 Figure 7 . 1 Proposed model of BTV entry into BFA cells Diagram shows the early requirements of NHE1 , rho protein and Dynamin - 2 ba signalling , which are activated upon BTV - 1 attachment to BFA cells . Actin rearrangement occurs between 1 and 2 hours and virus begins to be internalised at 2 and 3 hours . PAK1 signalling is required throughout BTV - 1 internalisation . BTV receptor , trafficking molecules and scission protein is currently unknown . Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 266 Investigations into endocytosis in Culicoides spp . derived cells were challenging due to the lack of knowledge of the biology of Culicoides spp . derived cells and therefore , the effects of pharmacological inhibitors were sometimes difficult to interpret . Further work should be carried out to confirm the entry mechanism BTV - 1 uses in Culicoides spp . derived cells . A valuable method to consider for studying this would be Proteomics Informed by Transcriptomics ( PIT ) ( Evans et al . , 2012 , Wynne et al . , 2014 ) . This method allows detection and quantification of the upregulation / downregulation of RNA transcripts and quantifies expression of the proteome at different time points during infection . Whilst most proteomic methods are reliant on an annotated genome and proteome , this method allows detection of the transcriptome to generate a theoretical proteome from which proteins detected from the high throughput proteomics can be evaluated against ( Evans et al . , 2012 ) . This method has generated invaluable results of Hendra virus replication in unannotated bat cell lines ( Wynne et al . , 2014 ) and this method would give a unique opportunity to identify not only key cellular proteins and small RNAs / transcripts required for BTV entry into KC cells but will generate a wealth of data that could contribute to the cell biology knowledge of these cells / species . Arboviruses , such as BTV , need to enter vertebrate host cells and cells of the insect vector . Dengue virus has been shown to use CME for productive entry into both mosquito cells ( Acosta et al . , 2011 , van der Schaar et al . , 2008 , Mosso et al . , 2008 ) and human monocytes ( Alhoot et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , whereas CHIKV uses CME for entry into mosquito cells ( Lee et al . , 2013 ) this virus appears to use a clathrin - independent mechanism for entry in mammalian cells ( Bernard et al . , 2010 ) . Together with observations from this study , this suggests that arboviruses are able to utilize different cell entry strategies to ensure productive entry into the insect vector and mammalian host cells . Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 267 The findings from this thesis corroborates previous research which identified cell culture adapted purified BTV1 particles can enter cells using a macropinocytosis - like entry mechanism ( Gold et al . , 2010 ) while tissue culture supernatant BTV10 reportedly entered by CME ( Forzan et al . , 2007 ) . This thesis has identified that a field isolate BTV - 1 can also utilize both of these entry pathways and has identified that the differences between the previous publications may be , in part , due to the different cell lines used in each of the studies . Previous studies have identified that BTV can interact with a number of cellular receptors , such as Glycophorin A ( Eaton and Crameri , 1989 ) , sialogycoprotein ( Hassan and Roy , 1999 ) and heparan sulphate ( Mecham and McHolland , 2010 ) , indicating that it is possible that BTV can bind and use multiple receptors . Use of the preferential receptor may be dependent on receptor availability on the target cell , which could explain , in part , the differences in endocytosis mechanisms used in different cell lines . Despite the contribution the research presented in this thesis makes to the field , there are still a number of key questions that are still to be addressed . There are at least three different infectious particles ; whole virion , ISVP ( generated by protease cleavage of VP2 ) and core particles ( generated by low pH through dissociation of VP2 and VP5 ) ( Darpel et al . , 2011 , Mertens et al . ) . Transmission of BTV to and from mammalian host occurs via vector bite , in the presence of midge saliva ( Mellor et al . , 2000 , Mellor et al . , 1984b ) which contains numerous pharmacological active substances including both proteases and protease inhibitors ( Lehiy and Drolet , 2014 , Langner et al . , 2007 ) . Currently the exact structure of the infectious particle that is transmitted between ruminant host and insect vector remains unknown , however particle type might influence receptor use and entry pathways in each host and subsequently , cell tropism . Therefore , entry mechanisms employed by different particle types in host derived cells and identification of the particle Chapter 7 : Understanding the early events of Bluetongue virus cell entry 268 type transmitted to and from each host should be investigated . Furthermore , as this thesis has identified that target cell type can influence entry strategies of BTV , investigation into primary target cells , such as microvascular endothelial cells and leukocytes would be a logical step to follow on from this research . In addition , comparisons of entry strategies between ovine and bovine cells may offer difference perspectives to BTV’s versatility when entering host cells . Taken together , this thesis provides novel insights into the endocytosis mechanisms that a low insect cell passage field isolate BTV uses during entry of host - derived cells in both the mammalian and insect host . Identification of novel cellular factors involved in BTV entry were made , such as the involvement of dynamin - 2 ba splice variant , rho protein signalling and PAK1 , all of which were not known previously . Furthermore , this research not only contributes to the field of BTV cell entry but also to the field of endocytosis as this thesis describes a variation of a macropinocytosis - like mechanism that involves the dynamin - 2 ba splice variant prior to cargo entry and appears to be independent of PI3 kinase . In addition , it provides clarification in the differences in endocytosis mechanisms that were previously observed in to other published works , which could be partly explained by usage of different target cells . Identification of key cellular factors required in both the insect and mammalian host cell entry could influence key targets for future drug therapeutics .
