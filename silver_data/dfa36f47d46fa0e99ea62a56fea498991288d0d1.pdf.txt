The model considers imperfect insurance , sticky prices and search and matching frictions . It also imbeds a set of ﬁscal policy instruments : government spending , unemploy - ment insurance ( UI ) beneﬁts and distortionary taxes , along with government bonds . The main interest of this framework is to oﬀer an explicit relation between the dynamics of un - employment , unemployment risk and their eﬀects on the real interest rate through the usual smoothing motive and through the precautionary saving motive . In addition , the dynamics of desired savings and the equilibrium real interest rate have feedback general equilibrium eﬀects through sticky prices and monetary policy . The model consider three types of households : employed workers , unemployed workers and ﬁrm owners . Workers are heterogeneous in terms of their labor - market history and borrowing constrained as in all HA models , but we make simple assumptions that greatly simplify the model since they imply that the distribution of wealth is degenerate , as in Ravn and Sterk ( 2020 ) or Challe ( 2020 ) . As a result , employed and unemployed workers consume exactly their income . Firm owners , who are more patient than workers , are the only type of households featuring positive assets in the form of government bonds and use them to smooth consumption . They would be willing to lend private assets to the workers , which implies that the expected real rate on this asset equates the expected real rate on bonds . However , workers are not allowed to hold negative assets but to borrowing constraints . Unemployed workers’ Euler equation implies that they are borrowing constrained in terms of the amount of private asset , and employed workers’ Euler equation implies that they hold zero private asset as an equilibrium outcome . This structure of ﬁnancial markets implies that the Euler equation of employed households’ Euler equation determines the equilibrium real interest rate . Its dynamics reﬂects two opposing forces : the consumption smoothing motive and the precautionary motive . The former implies that employed workers would like to borrow in the event of a shock that lowers their income temporarily to allow them to smooth their consumption , which , as in any representative - agent model would results in a rise of the real interest rate . The latter implies that , provided the negative shock raises their future probability of unemployment , they want to save to self - insure , which pushes the real interest rate down . Challe ( 2020 ) shows that the precautionary motive may dominate the smoothing motive for reasonable calibrations and if income is smooth enough compared to the dynamics of unemployment . As a result , negative productivity shocks may be deﬂationary , calling for an optimal fall in the nominal rate controlled by the Central rather than a rise , as usually seen in models with representative agents . 1 First , we propose a monthly calibration of our model that matches empirical facts about the labor markets of Euro Area countries . When driven by standard productivity shocks , the model predicts counter - cyclical and persistent ﬂuctuations of the unemployment rate , and their relative size with respect to the ﬂuctuations of output matches that observed in the data . Second , we quantify the eﬀects of lockdown policies by which a fraction of the labor force is kept out of job , and tailor the size of the shock to match the ( scarce ) existing evidence about the recent drop in economic activity , so as to lower output by 6 percents the ﬁrst month . We consider it to last either 1 , 2 or 3 months , and assume that exit from the lockdown is progressive . We ﬁnd that , even in the case of a 1 - month lockdown , output falls almost 10 percents below its steady - state value after a few month . Unemployment jumps from a steady - value of 7 . 6 percents to 13 . 2 percents on impact , and peaks at 16 . 7 percents in June 2020 . These large negative eﬀects result from the feedback loop between unemployment , consumption and output . The rise in unemployment depresses consumption and raises the desire to precautionary - save , which further lowers aggregate demand and output , and then further raises unemployment . In other words , aggregate demand is more depressed than supply , which is also reﬂected in the implied deﬂationary pressures : the inﬂation rate and the nominal interest rate both drop signiﬁcantly . Hence , the model generates what Guerrieri , Lorenzoni , Straub , and Werning ( 2020 ) coin as Keynesian supply shocks . Longer lockdown shocks aggravate the fall in output and consumption , magnify the rise in unemployment . Last , even though the government keeps the level of its consumption expenditure and the level of UI beneﬁts constant , the budget deﬁcit explodes because the distribution of UI beneﬁts surges and because the tax base shrinks . Given our assumption that taxes increase only mildly in the short and that most of the rise in deﬁcits are ﬁnanced by issuing bonds , the debt - GDP ratio rises by several percentage points : almost 12pp in the case of a 1 - month lockdown and up to 21 . 3pp for a 3 - months lockdown . While these numbers are already huge , there are good reasons to think that they are rather conservative . Growth projections by the IMF , unemployment claim numbers suggest that the shock might be larger and trigger larger negative eﬀects . In the above simulations , we assume that government spending and UI beneﬁts remain constant while , in reality , both increased in most countries . For instance , in France , a 100 billion euros package was acted and UI beneﬁts were extended to allow for partial unemployment ( temporary unemployment where workers receive roughly 80 percents of the usual wage income ) . We thus also quantify the eﬀects of these two types of policies on macroeconomic variables . While both measures could stimulate aggregate demand , they have basically no eﬀects on aggregate output since supply is not there anyway . Government spending hikes generate inﬂationary eﬀects but UI beneﬁt extensions generate further deﬂationary pressures : since extensions are temporary , 2 employed households are better insured against unemployment today but not tomorrow , which generates additional precautionary savings . While these policies are relatively inef - fective in mitigating the aggregate dynamics of output and unemployment , they do have eﬀects on the welfare of households . Calculating the optimized government spending and UI beneﬁts in response to lockdown policies shows that a little more generous unemployment insurance and a little less public spending should be considered . None of the policies has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on unemployment or on GDP as clearly supply shocks can not be alleviated by demand stimulation measures . Economic policies can just mitigate the negative eﬀects on the utility of agents by reducing deﬂation and temporarily improving risk sharing . Research on the macroeconomic eﬀects of the Covid - 19 epidemic have burgeoned in the recent weeks . Most contributions oﬀer a mix of SIR ( epidemiological ) models and macroeco - nomic models to analyze the joint dynamics of the pandemic and macroeconomic variables depending on lockdown policies , and derive optimal lockdown policies ( See Eichenbaum , Rebelo , and Trabandt ( 2020 ) , Krueger , Uhlig , and Xie ( 2020 ) , Piguillem and Shi ( 2020 ) among other ) . Another set of papers is concerned by the eﬀects of lockdown policies and how traditional policy instrument might mitigate them ( See Bayer , Born , Luetticke , and M¨uller ( 2020 ) , Fornaro and Wolf ( 2020 ) or Guerrieri et al . ( 2020 ) , ) . Our paper is closer to these contributions . Guerrieri et al . ( 2020 ) show the conditions under which supply shocks can have Keynesian features , i . e . generate excess demand ﬂuctuations . They also show that government spending might be much less eﬀective in stabilizing the economy and that risk - sharing considerations matter critically . Our contribution in regard to their paper is to show that Keynesian supply shocks can arise in one - sector models with sticky prices , in - complete markets and unemployment risk . Fornaro and Wolf ( 2020 ) propose a very stylized model to understand the potential eﬀects of monetary and ﬁscal policies in the context of an epidemic that induces a lockdown . Their main point is to understand the qualitative eﬀects as well as to underline that lockdown policies might induce stagnation traps . Our goal is more quantitative and our focus is exclusively on ﬁscal policy instruments , considering that monetary policy is conducted through a standard Taylor - type rule . Finally , our paper is arguably closest to Bayer et al . ( 2020 ) , who build a model with heterogeneous agents to quantify the eﬀects of a lockdown and the eﬀects of transfer policies . Contrary to them , our model has a degenerate distribution of wealth and does not allow for such a granular analysis , in particular in terms of the eﬀects of transfer policies on marginal propensities to consume . However , our model imbeds unemployment risk and equilibrium unemployment through search and matching frictions , two features that we believe are critical to understand the current situation , while both features are absent in Bayer et al . ( 2020 ) . Our work can thus be seen as a complement to these existing studies . The paper is organized as follows . The model is described and discussed in Section 2 . 3 Section 3 calibrates the model . Section 4 discusses the implications of lockdown policies depending on their duration . Section 5 analyzes the eﬀects of stimulus packages ( a raise in government spending ) and those of UI beneﬁt extension programs . Finally , Section 6 derives the optimized government spending and UI beneﬁt policies in response to the lockdown . Section 7 oﬀers concluding remarks . 2 Model The model structure borrows from Ravn and Sterk ( 2020 ) and features three types of house - holds : employed workers , unemployed workers and ﬁrm owners . As will be clear , unemployed workers are ﬁnancially constrained while employed workers hold zero assets as an equilib - rium result , because they are too impatient given market rates and have a restricted access to government bonds . Firm owners are more patient than workers , receive proﬁts , consume and hold government bonds . The rest of the model is a standard search and matching framework with Nash bargained wages , that sets the stage for the endogenous dynamics of the unemployment rate , that aﬀects the composition of the household sector and the extent of unemployment risk . Finally , a government sector is introduced , that levies distortionary taxes on labor income and issues bonds to ﬁnance unemployment insurance beneﬁts and public spending . 2 . 1 Households The economy is populated with a unit size continuum of households , a proportion χ ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] of workers that can either be employed or not , and a proportion ( 1 − χ ) of ﬁrm owners that receive proﬁts from production . Firm owners . Firm owners receive the proﬁts , hold assets and consume . They maximize their lifetime utility E t (cid:40) ∞ (cid:88) s = t (cid:0) β f (cid:1) s − t u (cid:0) c fs , g s (cid:1)(cid:41) ( 1 ) where denotes their per - capita consumption and β f their discount factor , subject to the following ( aggregate ) resource constraint a ft + ( 1 − χ ) c ft = ( 1 + r t − 1 ) a ft − 1 + Π t ( 2 ) where r t − 1 is the return on assets between periods t − 1 and t . The corresponding Euler 4 equation on bonds yields E t   β f ( 1 + r t ) u c (cid:16) c ft + 1 , g t + 1 (cid:17) u c (cid:16) c ft , g t (cid:17)   = 1 ( 3 ) Workers . Household i ∈ [ 0 , χ ] belongs to the category of workers maximizes the following welfare index E t (cid:40) ∞ (cid:88) s = t β s − t u (cid:0) c is , g s (cid:1)(cid:41) ( 4 ) where β < β f is the subjective discount factor of workers , c i , t > 0 is the consumption of household i and g t is the aggregate amount of public spending . The budget constraint of household i is : a it + c it = ( 1 + r t − 1 ) a it − 1 + ε it ( 1 − τ t ) w t + (cid:0) 1 − ε it (cid:1) b t , a it > 0 ( 5 ) where a it is the household’s wealth . Variable ε it = { 0 , 1 } gives the employment status of the household : when ε it = 1 , the household is employed at the real wage w t ; when ε it = 0 , the household is unemployed and receives an unemployment insurance b t = b rt w , where we denote b rt as the replacement rate of UI beneﬁts . The wage income is taxed at the rate τ t while UI beneﬁts are exempted . The number of employed workers in the economy and the unemployment rate are tied by n t + u t = 1 . At the beginning of period t , a proportion s of past employment relationships are exogenously destroyed and the pool of unemployed workers is u t − 1 + sn t − 1 . Among these employed workers , a fraction f t becomes employed before the end of period t . The number of employed workers is thus given by the following equation n t = ( 1 − σ t ) n t − 1 + f t ( 1 − n t − 1 ) − Λ t ( 6 ) where σ t = s ( 1 − f t ) is net separation rate , and where the job - ﬁnding rate f t and the worker - ﬁnding rate q t are respectively deﬁned as f t = ψ (cid:18) v t u t − 1 + sn t − 1 (cid:19) 1 − γ and q t = ψ (cid:18) u t − 1 + sn t − 1 v t (cid:19) γ ( 7 ) Variable Λ t is an exogenous shock that lowers employment , and captures the eﬀects of the lockdown policies applied by governments to ﬂatten the pandemic curve induced by the Covid - 19 epidemic . From the perspective of a currently employed household , the Euler 5 equation on asset writes E t (cid:40) β ( 1 + r t ) ( 1 − σ t + 1 ) u c (cid:0) c i = e t + 1 , g t + 1 (cid:1) + σ t + 1 u c (cid:0) c i = u t + 1 , g t + 1 (cid:1) u c ( c i = e t , g t ) (cid:41) ≤ 1 ( 8 ) where σ t = s ( 1 − f t ) is the transition probability from employment to unemployment at the end of period t , and c i = e t and c i = u t respectively denote the individual consumption level of worker i if employed or unemployed . The above equation holds with equality when employed household i is not constrained , and with inequality when she is constrained . We assume ( i ) that workers are more impatient than ﬁrm owners and calibrate the steady - state value of β so that Equation ( 8 ) holds with equality , and ( ii ) that workers do not have access to the bond market . 1 As a consequence , they hold exactly zero assets ( a i = e t = 0 ) , implying a degenerate wealth distribution , and all employed households have the same per - capita level of consumption c i = e t = c et = ( 1 − τ t ) w t . Further , given that σ t > 0 and u c (cid:0) c et + 1 , g t (cid:1) < u c (cid:0) c ut + 1 , g t (cid:1) , a precautionary motive arises due to the risk of unemployment . Employed workers face a potentially decreasing future consumption schedule , driven by the risk of income loss . It pushes them to save to self - insure through savings . However , because they can not access bonds markets , the excess asset demand translates into a lower real rate . From the perspective of unemployed households , the Euler equation holds with strict inequality and writes E t (cid:40) β ( 1 + r t ) ( 1 − f t + 1 ) u c (cid:0) c i = u t + 1 , g t (cid:1) + f t + 1 u c (cid:0) c i = e t + 1 , g t (cid:1) u c ( c i = u t , g t ) (cid:41) ≤ 1 ( 9 ) which means that unemployed households are constrained , and therefore achieve an identical level per - capita consumption c i = u t = c ut = b t = b rt w . 2 . 2 Production and wage determination As in the search and matching literature , each ﬁrm is a job . Firms post v t vacancies , paying a unit vacancy cost κ , out of which a fraction q t will be ﬁlled to produce goods with a linear technology . The aggregate production function is thus y t = χn t z t Given that the intermediate good is sold on competitive markets at price ϕ t , the marginal 1 Imagine that agents can trade two types of assets , private and government bonds . Firm owners can access both types of assets provided there quantity is positive , and a no - arbitrage condition characterizes the returns on both assets . However , workers can only access private assets , at the same equilibrium rate than government bonds . Hence , in case of a shock that raises unemployment risk , ( employed ) workers would like to save in the form of private bonds but can not because the latter are in zero net supply , and are therefore constrained although they act as if they were not . 6 value of a ﬁlled position is : J t = ϕ t z t − w t + E t { ∆ t , t + 1 ( ( 1 − s ) J t + 1 + sV t + 1 ) } ( 10 ) where the ﬁrst argument is the net contribution of the marginal worker , his marginal product less his wage bill , the second argument is the continuation value , and where ∆ t , t + 1 = βu c (cid:16) c ft + 1 , g t + 1 (cid:17) / u c (cid:16) c ft , g t (cid:17) ( 11 ) is the stochastic discount factor of ﬁrm owners . The value of a position remaining vacant is 2 V t = − κ + E t { q t J t + ∆ t , t + 1 ( ( 1 − q t ) V t + 1 ) } ( 12 ) and we assume that the free entry condition V t = 0 holds , which implies q t J t = κ . The total proﬁts made by intermediate goods producers are Π mt = ϕ t y t − w t χn t − κv t ( 13 ) The real wage is sticky in the sense that the eﬀective wage is a geometric average of the ( notional ) Nash - bargained wage : w t = w α ( w nt ) 1 − α where w nt is a notional wage , determined as the solution to a Nash bargaining problem . The notional wage maximizes a geometric average of workers and ﬁrm job surpluses w nt = arg max ( S t ) θ J t ( w nt ) 1 − θ ( 14 ) where θ is the bargaining power of workers , S t is the surplus of being employed : S t = u ( ( 1 − τ t ) w t , g t ) − u ( b t , g t ) + β E t { ( 1 − σ t + 1 − f t + 1 ) S t + 1 } ( 15 ) where , remember , where σ t = s ( 1 − f t ) is the transition probability from employment to unemployment at the end of period t . The Nash bargaining solution to this problem implies w nt = θ ( ϕ t z t + E t { ∆ t , t + 1 ( 1 − s ) κ / q t + 1 } ) θ + ( 1 − θ ) S t ( 16 ) Retailers buy the intermediate good y t and then diﬀerentiate it into varieties i to sell them at nominal price p t ( i ) on the market for ﬁnal goods . Let y dt denote the total demand for 2 Since vacancies can be ﬁlled within the period the current value of a vacancies depends on the current probability of the vacancy to be ﬁlled and the current value of a job ﬁlled . 7 ﬁnal goods and y dt ( i ) the demand for variety i . Retailer i sets its price p t ( i ) to maximize the discounted sum of its expected dividends : E t (cid:40) ∞ (cid:88) s = t ∆ t , s Π rs (cid:41) ( 17 ) where Π rt = (cid:32) p t ( i ) p t − p mt − φ 2 (cid:18) p t ( i ) p t − 1 (cid:19) 2 (cid:33) y dt ( i ) ( 18 ) The demand for each variety depends on aggregate demand , on the relative price of good i and the elasticity of substitution between varieties η > 1 , i . e . y dt ( i ) = ( p t ( i ) / p t ) − η y dt . We denote φ as the size of Rotemberg adjustment costs Optimal pricing conditions are symmetric and imply η − 1 = ηϕ t − φ ( π t ( 1 + π t ) − E t { ∆ t , t + 1 π t + 1 ( 1 + π t + 1 ) y t + 1 / y t } ) ( 19 ) where π t = p t / p t − 1 − 1 is the net inﬂation rate . Finally , total ( intermediate and ﬁnal ) proﬁts redistributed to ﬁrm owners are given by Π t = Π mt + Π rt = y t (cid:0) 1 − φπ 2 t / 2 (cid:1) − χn t w t − κv t ( 20 ) 2 . 3 Government , monetary policy , aggregation and equilibrium The government purchases public goods g t and provides unemployment insurance to the unemployed workers . It ﬁnances this stream of expenditure using the labor income tax and government bonds , so that its budget constraint writes : ( 1 + r t − 1 ) d t − 1 + g t + χu t b = d t + τ t χn t w t ( 21 ) The labor income tax rate is used to ensure the sustainability of government debt in the long run using the following policy rule τ t = τ + d τ ( dy t − 1 − dy ) ( 22 ) where dy t = d t / ( 12 y t ) is the debt to annual GDP ratio . The Central Bank controls the nominal interest rate i nt and sets it according to the following simple Taylor - type rule subject to a zero lower bound : i nt = max (cid:0) r + ρ r i nt − 1 + ( 1 − ρ r ) d π π t , 0 (cid:1) ( 23 ) 8 where the real rate is then determined according to the following Fisher equation 1 + r t = E { ( 1 + i nt ) / ( 1 + π t + 1 ) } ( 24 ) The market clearing condition on the market for ﬁnal goods and services is y t (cid:0) 1 − φπ 2 t / 2 (cid:1) = χ ( n t c et + u t c ut ) + ( 1 − χ ) c ft + g t + κ t v t ( 25 ) and the government bonds market clearing condition is d t = a ft . A competitive equilibrium in this economy is deﬁned as a situation where , for a given path of ﬁscal policy instruments F t = { g t , b rt , d t } : ( i ) for a given path of prices , households satisfy their optimality conditions and budget constraints , the ﬁrm and retailers optimize and the government budget constraint holds , and ( ii ) for a given path of quantities , prices adjust – subject to Rotemberg costs – so that all markets clear and the Nash bargaining solution for the notional real wage is veriﬁed . 3 Calibration In this section , public spending and UI beneﬁts remain constant { g t , b rt } = { g , b r } . Before we derive quantitative results from our model , we calibrate it targeting targets the average Euro Area economy . Preferences . Let us start by specifying a utility function for workers and for ﬁrm owners . Public expenditure are introduced in the utility function of agents to introduce meaningful policy trade - oﬀs when allowing for variable public spending . More precisely , for all types of workers , we assume that utility stems from a bundle of private and public goods . Let us deﬁne ˜ c it = (cid:0) ( 1 − Υ ) (cid:0) c it (cid:1) ν + Υ g νt (cid:1) 1 ν ( 26 ) for i = { e , u , f } as the consumption bundle combining private and public goods , and assume that both types of consumption are complement , i . e . ν < 0 . This assumption has already received quite some empirical support in the literature ( see Bouakez and Rebei ( 2007 ) or Auray and Eyquem ( 2019 ) ) , but is even more relevant in a pandemic context : households’ consumption is higher when ( public health ) spending is higher and vice - versa . Further , we assume that the utility function of workers is u ( c it , h t ) = log ( ˜ c it ) for i = { e , u } and , following Challe ( 2020 ) , the utility function of ﬁrm owners is u ( c ft , g t ) = ( ˜ c ft ) 1 − ρ f / ( 1 − ρ f ) . Calibration for the households . The model is monthly . The discount factor is β = ( 0 . 9925 ) 1 / 3 = 0 . 9975 , which pins down the steady - state real rate in the baseline model to r = 0 . 1761 % monthly or 2 . 1339 % annually . Given the precautionary motive that is caused by unemploy - ment risk , employed workers would like to self - insure and therefore demand more private 9 assets than in a perfect insurance economy . Since they do not have access to private assets and that ﬁrm owners arbitrage between public and private assets , the excess demand of private assets is reﬂected in a lower equilibrium real interest rate on government bonds than the one implied by the subjective interest rate , given by r = 0 . 1636 % < 1 / β − 1 = 0 . 2513 % . The equilibrium real rate is obtained by setting the nominal rate at i n = r and by imposing a zero inﬂation target to the Central Bank . In this steady state , unemployed households are 13 . 24 % poorer on average than employed workers : c e = 0 . 5735 > c u = 0 . 4976 . Put diﬀerently , the average drop in consumption when becoming unemployed is roughly 13 % . As in Challe ( 2020 ) , the share of ﬁrm owners to 10 % , that is χ = 0 . 9 and ρ f = 0 . 25 . The discount factor of ﬁrm owners is set to β f = 1 / ( 1 + r ) = 0 . 9982 . The parameter governing the elasticity of substitution between private and public goods is set to ν = − 2 / 3 , imply - ing an elasticity of 0 . 6 , as estimated by Auray and Eyquem ( 2019 ) . Last , the government spending utility weight Υ is calibrated in accordance with “Samuelson’s principle’ following Bilbiie , Monacelli , and Perotti ( 2019 ) or Auray , Eyquem , and Gomme ( 2018 ) . For the given calibrated value of g ( see below ) , γ is set to equalize the weighted average marginal utility of public spending to the weighted average of marginal utilities of the consumption of private goods . It gives γ = 0 . 1049 . Calibration for ﬁrms and monetary policy . We set the steady - state monopolistic com - petition markup of retailers to 20 % , implying η = 6 . In addition , the Rotemberg pa - rameter is set according the a ﬁrst - order equivalence between Calvo and Rotemberg pa - rameters . A 0 . 75 probability of keeping the price ﬁxed in the quarterly Calvo set - up im - plies a 0 . 9 in the monthly set - up . Hence , the equivalent Rotemberg parameter is given by φ = ( η − 1 ) 0 . 9 / (cid:0) ( 1 − 0 . 9 ) (cid:0) 1 − β f 0 . 9 (cid:1)(cid:1) = 443 . The elasticity of the nominal interest rate to inﬂation is given by d π = 1 . 5 and the persistence parameter is ρ i = 0 . 85 . Calibration for the government . We calibrate g / y = 0 . 1928 based on Euro Area data . Further , the replacement rate is b r = 0 . 6 ( see Esser , Ferrarini , Nelson , Palme , and Sj¨uberg ( 2013 ) ) and we the debt - to - annual GDP is set according to the last available data ( 2018 ) for the Euro Area to d / ( 12 y ) = 0 . 86 . We assume that the steady - state labor income tax is adjusted for the budget of the government to be balanced , which implies τ = 0 . 3084 . The feedback parameter of the tax rule is set to d τ = 0 . 05 , the lowest value that is consistent with long - run debt sustainability . Calibration for the labor market . On the labor market , we also seek to replicate key Euro Area data . In line with Challe ( 2020 ) , we set the elasticity of matches with respect to unemployment to γ = 2 / 3 , which is also in the range of estimates proposed by Pissarides and Petrongolo ( 2001 ) . Using the labor - market transition probabilities estimated by Elsby , Hobijn , and S¸ahin ( 2013 ) , we impose a net separation of σ = 0 . 005 and adjust the job - ﬁnding 10 rate to deliver a u = 0 . 076 unemployment rate . We get f = 0 . 00608 , which lines up pretty well with the numbers reported by Elsby , Hobijn , and S¸ahin ( 2013 ) . Along with Challe ( 2020 ) , the wage stickiness parameter is set to α = 0 . 946 . We also impose a steady - state worker - ﬁnding probability of q = 0 . 7 3 = 0 . 3430 . Finally , the vacancy posting cost parameter κ remains to be pinned down . Along with the rest of the calibration , it determines the bargaining power of workers θ and the matching eﬃciency parameter ψ . We choose to target a θ = 0 . 75 bargaining power , implying κ = 0 . 1976 , and the matching eﬃciency parameter is ψ = 0 . 1082 When the model is fed with stochastic productivity shocks with a persistence of 0 . 95 and a 1 percent standard deviation , it predicts a 7 . 3 relative volatility of the unemployment rate with respect to output and unemployment is strongly counter - cyclical ( the contemporaneous correlation is - 0 . 93 ) .

A lockdown policy consists in setting Λ t = Λ for a given duration . 3 After the lockdown is lifted , we assume that its exit rate is 0 . 5 per month . We consider the model to be in the steady state in February 2020 , and consider a lockdown shock starting in March 2020 . We calibrate the size of the lockdown shock to match the ( scarce ) evidence about the output costs of the lockdown . In France , numbers have been released suggesting that output growth was − 6 percent in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020 . Provided growth was close enough to zero in the ﬁrst two quarters , we adjust the size of the lockdown shock so that it produces a 6 percent fall in output from its steady - state value . We consider three alternative durations : 1 month , 2 months or 3 months . Given that the shock is extremely large , linear approximations are likely unreliable , so we simulate the model non - linearly considering the shock as an MIT shock . 4 Figure 1 reports the eﬀects of lockdown policies on our model economy . It tracks the dynamics of key macroeconomic aggregates , along with the welfare losses from the lockdown policies , denoted ζ . We adopt a utilitarian approach to the welfare criterion and attribute to each type of household an equal weight . As such , we consider the Hicksian consumption equivalent that solves : T (cid:88) t = 0 ˜ β t (cid:16) U (cid:16) c et , c ut , c ft , g t (cid:17) − U (cid:0) c e ( 1 − ζ T ) ) , c u ( 1 − ζ T ) ) , c f ( 1 − ζ T ) ) , g t (cid:1)(cid:17) = 0 ( 27 ) where ˜ β = χβ + ( 1 − χ ) β f , T is the horizon over which welfare losses are computed and U t = χ ( n t log ˜ c et + u t log ˜ c ut ) + ( 1 − χ ) ( ˜ c ft ) 1 − ρ f / ( 1 − ρ f ) ( 28 ) where remember , ˜ c refers to a bundle of private and public goods . Let us start with the eﬀects of a 1 - month lockdown . Figure 1 shows that , by construction , the response of GDP is − 6 percents on impact . However , the overall drop in GDP is much larger because the lockdown is lifted gradually , which prevent some workers to going back on the labor market quickly . The overall drop in GDP thus reaches almost 10 percents ( - 9 . 89 ) . Consumption falls as well , not so much because the consumption of workers remaining 3 Lockdown in the Chinese province of Wuhan lasted 2 . 5 months . Most countries that engaged in such policies will set a minimal duration of one month . 4 The model is simulated under perfect foresight using a Newton - type algorithm to account for the potential non - linear eﬀects of the shocks . The algorithm is a built - in routine of Dynare ( see Adjemian , Bastani , Juillard , Karam´e , Mihoubi , Perendia , Pfeifer , Ratto , and Villemot ( 2011 ) ) . It is an application of the Newton - Raphson algorithm that takes advantage of the special structure of the Jacobian matrix in dynamic models with forward - looking variables . The details of the algorithm are explained in Juillard ( 1996 ) . 12 Figure 1 : Macroeconomic eﬀects of lockdown policies . 21 22 23 24 25 - 15 - 10 - 5 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 - 20 - 15 - 10 - 5 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 10 15 20 21 22 23 24 25 - 0 . 8 - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 5 . 5 5 . 6 5 . 7 5 . 8 5 . 9 21 22 23 24 25 59 60 61 21 22 23 24 25 19 19 . 5 20 20 . 5 % o f SS GD P 21 22 23 24 25 31 31 . 2 31 . 4 31 . 6 31 . 8 21 22 23 24 25 - 2 - 1 0 % p e r a nn . 21 22 23 24 25 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 2 2 . 2 % p e r a nn . 21 22 23 24 25 90 95 100 105 % o f S S GD P 21 22 23 24 25 6 8 10 % , H i c k s i a n e q . Dotted : One month . Solid : 2 months ( baseline ) . Dashed : 3 months . 13 employed falls , but because many workers are now unemployed . This composition eﬀect lowers consumption by almost 13 percent ( 12 . 72 ) at the trough . The reason for the lower fall in GDP compared to consumption is that GDP includes the saved vacancy posting costs , since vacancies fall dramatically . The unemployment rate jumps at 13 . 2 percents on impact and reaches a peak of 16 . 7 percents , at the end of June 2020 . The proﬁtability of a match falls substantially , which lowers the bargained notional real wage and thus the eﬀective real wage , although by less than 0 . 6 percent . The dynamics of inﬂation is of the utmost interest . Indeed , when facing a negative supply shock , a standard RANK economy would predict a rise in the real interest rate , and rise in inﬂation and a rise in the nominal rate . The chief reason is that the Euler equation would imply that the marginal utility of consumption is lower in the future than in the present , since consumption is lower today and higher tomorrow . The equilibrium real rate should thus rise , reﬂecting the demand of the representative household to borrow to smooth the consequences of the negative supply shock . In our model , this motive is present , but an additional motive determines the equilibrium real rate : the demand for a precautionary motive . When future unemployment rises , workers face a potential decrease in their con - sumption path that depresses their consumption and raises their desired savings . The real rate thus falls , aggregate demand falls along with inﬂation , and the nominal rate falls . This is the case here , as the model implies that aggregate demand is depressed more than supply , leading the shock to have even larger negative macroeconomic consequences . Hence , our model predicts that the current lockdown policies have a current deﬂationary eﬀect . After unemployment reaches its peak , the logic inverts , precautionary savings fall , raising the real rate , leading to inﬂationary eﬀects . However , in our case , the subsequent inﬂationary eﬀects are much smaller than the initial deﬂation eﬀects : inﬂation drops by 1 . 08pp in annual terms and then jumps at 0 . 43pp when unemployment starts falling . The dynamics of inﬂation implies a negative response of the nominal rate controlled by the Central Bank . In our model , the drop in inﬂation is not large enough to push the nominal rate at the ZLB . In addition , because the distribution of UI beneﬁts explodes and because the ( labor income ) tax base shrinks , a large public deﬁcit arises : from - 3 percents of steady - state output on impact to 5 . 8 percents at the trough . Hence , the debt ratio rises slowly and eventually reaches more than 97 . 7 percents of steady - state GDP , a 11 . 7pp increase . The labor income tax rate rises gradually to help ﬁnance the deﬁcit , by more than 0 . 58pp . When the lockdown lasts for more than one month , the impact responses of output , con - sumption and unemployment are the same but the subsequent movements are much larger . Output falls by 14 . 8 percents when lockdown lasts 2 months and 17 . 2 percents when it lasts 3 months . The fall in consumption shows a similar pattern ( - 19 and - 22 percents respectively ) , 14 unemployment rises to much higher levels ( 21 . 3 and 23 . 5 percents respectively ) , which mag - niﬁes the precautionary motive and leads to much greater deﬂationary eﬀects : inﬂation falls by 2pp in the 2 - month case and by 2 . 6pp in the 3 - month case , which triggers much larger drops in the nominal rate of the Central Bank . Finally , the debt ratio increases by more 18pp and 21 . 3pp respectively . Last but not least , the welfare losses from the lockdown policy are substantially large . They peak at 7 . 5 percents of consumption equivalent in the case of a 1 - month lockdown , almost 10 percents for a 2 - months lockdown and 11 . 3 percents if the lockdown lasts 3 months . In particular , the maximum welfare losses in the case of a 2 - months lockdown arise at the horizon of 8 months , in October 2020 . 5 Raising government spending and UI beneﬁts Figure 2 now reports the dynamics of our economy in the baseline case of a 2 - months lock - down when the government adopts passive policies by which government spending and the UI replacement rate remain constant ( solid ) with a case where the government raises spend - ing to steady - state GDP by 4pp ( i . e . from 0 . 198 to 0 . 238 , dotted line ) and with a case where the government raises the UI replacement rate by 10pp ( i . e . from 0 . 6 to 0 . 7 , dashed line ) . In each case , the policy instrument is raised for the duration of the lockdown and decays at the same rate as the lockdown . A last case combines both spending and UI beneﬁt policies . The ﬁrst active policy case is realistic given that , for example , France recently announced a total stimulus package of 100 billions of euros , representing approximately 4 . 25 percent of GDP . The second is also realistic , given that in most Euro Area countries , a partial unemployment system allows workers that are temporarily locked down to get a substantial fraction of their usual labor income . Figure 2 draws quite a pessimistic picture : neither the rise in government spending or the increase in UI beneﬁts are able to ﬂatten the output curve . While somehow surprising , the chief reason is relatively simple : an exogenous increase in aggregate demand relative to the case of passive policies does not alleviate the constraint on supply . Even if the government could stimulate demand , supply is simply not there . As a consequence , the unemployment rate is almost not aﬀected either . Aggregate consumption is only marginally aﬀected by the UI beneﬁt policy , and lowered by the spending policy because of crowding out eﬀects . The crowding out eﬀect is reﬂected in a lower fall of inﬂation when government spending is raised . On the contrary , when the UI rate is raised , the deﬂationary eﬀect of the lockdown policy is magniﬁed : employed workers understand that they are almost fully insured today but that it will not last , therefore raising the precautionary motive . For instance , inﬂation falls by 2pp in annual terms in the baseline case with passive policies , by 0 . 55pp when public spending 15 Figure 2 : The eﬀects of spending and UI beneﬁt policies . 21 22 23 24 25 - 14 - 12 - 10 - 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 - 20 - 15 - 10 - 5 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 10 15 20 21 22 23 24 25 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 5 . 5 6 6 . 5 21 22 23 24 25 60 65 70 21 22 23 24 25 20 21 22 23 % o f SS GD P 21 22 23 24 25 31 31 . 2 31 . 4 31 . 6 21 22 23 24 25 - 2 0 2 % p e r a nn . 21 22 23 24 25 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 % p e r a nn . 21 22 23 24 25 90 95 100 105 % o f SS GD P 21 22 23 24 25 4 6 8 % , H i c k s i a n e q .

Note : The time range for the plot of inﬂation has been shortened for to better illustrate the ( short - run ) eﬀects of policies on inﬂation . 16 are increased and by 3pp when the UI replacement is raised . Nevertheless the consequences of these policies are mainly reﬂected in nominal variables rather than in real variables , as already mentioned . Finally , Table 2 below reports the welfare losses from the 4 cases at the 8 - months horizon . Both discretionary policies reduce the welfare losses although not by much . The public spending policy cuts the welfare losses by roughly 0 . 5pp while the UI beneﬁt policy lower them by 0 . 35pp . The combination of both policies reduces the welfare losses by 0 . 6pp . 6 Optimized government spending and UI beneﬁts So government policies are almost ineﬀective in reducing the fall in output or the increase in unemployment . Does it mean that the government should not intervene in this context ? This is clearly not the case because these policies can still aﬀect welfare while having relatively little eﬀects on output and unemployment . Hence , we now analyze the optimized responses of spending and the UI replacement rate to the lockdown shock . To do this , let us consider the two simple policy rules for government spending and the UI replacement rate : g t − g = ( 1 − ρ g ) ( g t − 1 − g ) + d g Λ t ( 29 ) b rt − b r = ( 1 − ρ b ) ( b rt − 1 − b r ) + d b Λ t ( 30 ) where ρ g and ρ b are now allowed to diﬀer from the autoregressive parameter of the lockdown shock , and d g and d b are the feedback parameters to the lockdown policy . The idea of our optimized policies is to ﬁnd the set of parameters P = { ρ g , ρ b , d g , d b } that minimizes the welfare losses from the household sector that result from the lockdown policy ζ . Given that our baseline scenario is a 2 - months lockdown shock , and that welfare losses peak 8 months after the lockdown shock hits , we consider policies that seek to minimize the welfare losses at the 8 - months horizon , that is ζ 8 . Figure 3 reports the dynamics implied by optimized policies , along with those under discretionary policies investigated in the previous section and the passive case , for a comparison . Figure 3 shows that the optimized policies are actually very close to the discretionary policies undertaken by government since the beginning of the lockdown : raise public expenditure substantially and raise UI beneﬁts ( which , given the simplicity of our model , could mean in reality an extension in duration or a rise in the amount of UI beneﬁts ) . The quantitative results of our optimized policies imply however that public spending should rise less ( 2 . 5pp of steady - state GDP ) than under discretionary policies ( 4pp of steady - state GDP ) , and that the replacement rate of UI beneﬁts should rise more ( 12 . 9pp ) than under discretionary policies ( 10pp ) . In any case , as shown by Table 2 , the welfare gains from optimized policies with 17 Figure 3 : Optimized spending and UI beneﬁt policies . 21 22 23 24 25 - 14 - 12 - 10 - 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 - 20 - 15 - 10 - 5 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 10 15 20 21 22 23 24 25 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 % d e v . 21 22 23 24 25 5 . 4 5 . 6 5 . 8 6 21 22 23 24 25 60 65 70 21 22 23 24 25 20 21 22 23 % o f SS GD P 21 22 23 24 25 31 31 . 2 31 . 4 31 . 6 21 22 23 24 25 - 2 0 2 % p e r a nn . 21 22 23 24 25 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 % p e r a nn . 21 22 23 24 25 90 95 100 105 % o f SS GD P 21 22 23 24 25 4 6 8 % , H i c k s i a n e q .

Our assumptions produced a degenerate distribution of house - holds that greatly simpliﬁed the model . Hit with a shock that lowers employment for a few months , the model produced very large numbers for the drop in economic activity and the rise in unemployment . The rise in present and expected unemployment led households to precautionary save , making the lockdown shock a Keynesian supply shock . It also predicted an important deterioration of the state of public ﬁnances . The longer the lockdown the larger the resulting depression . In addition , because European labor markets are relatively sluggish , the recovery was slow and the eﬀects of the shock lasted at least until 2025 . Fi - nally , we analyzed the eﬀects of raising public spending and extending UI beneﬁts , and found that those policies had little eﬀect on output and unemployment dynamics , but were able to mitigate the welfare losses from lockdown policies by sustaining aggregate demand and fostering risk - sharing among households . Optimized policies were found to be close enough to the actual policies chosen by most European governments . 19 References Adjemian , St´ephane , Houtan Bastani , Michel Juillard , Fr´ed´eric Karam´e , Ferhat Mihoubi , George Perendia , Johannes Pfeifer , Marco Ratto , and S´ebastien Villemot . 2011 . “Dynare : Reference Manual , Version 4 . ” Dynare Working Paper 1 , CEPREMAP .
