Windler 1 and David Bilder 1 , * 1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , Berkeley , CA 94720 - 3200 , USA Summary The internalization of transmembrane receptors from the cell surface plays a central role in signal regulation . Receptor internalization can occur through different routes [ 1 ] ; however , because of the difﬁculty in selectively blocking these routes in vivo , their roles in signaling are poorly under - stood . Here we use null mutations in Drosophila dynamin , clathrin , and AP - 2 adaptor subunits to analyze internaliza - tion requirements for the Delta ligand and its receptor , Notch . Bulk Notch is internalized via AP - 2 - dependent endo - cytosis , but signaling by Notch requires AP - 2 - independent clathrin - dependent endocytosis , highlighting a distinction between Notch endocytic routes required for degradation versus signaling activation . Signaling by Delta requires dy - namin , but whether this generates a pulling force of Delta on Notch or allows for Delta entry into a recycling pathway to gain signaling competence is widely debated [ 2 , 3 ] . Surprisingly , we show that signaling by Delta in germline cells can occur by clathrin - independent endocytosis , when endosomal entry is blocked , and when activity of Rab11 or its effectors is reduced , suggesting that Delta need not pass through a recognized recycling pathway to achieve signaling competence . The absolute requirement for dyna - min - dependent endocytosis but not endosomal entry or Rab11 activity supports ‘‘pulling force’’ rather than ‘‘recy - cling’’ models for Delta activation . Results and Discussion Endocytosis has emerged as a key process governing intercel - lular interactions such as cell - cell signaling . The most impor - tant endocytic step in signal regulation is internalization from the cell surface because this controls receptor access to extra - cellular stimuli and may also inﬂuence intercellular signal transduction . A large body of literature has deﬁned several distinct routes by which receptors are internalized [ 1 , 4 ] . For many receptors , internalization is mediated by cargo - speciﬁc adaptors , such as the AP - 2 complex , which recruit clathrin to form coated pits that subsequently undergo dynamin - depen - dent scission . This route can be called AP - 2 - dependent endo - cytosis ( ADE ) ; however , AP - 2 - independent clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis ( CDE ) , dynamin - dependent endocytosis ( DDE ) that is clathrin independent ( CIE ) , and dynamin - inde - pendent endocytosis ( DIE ) also exist . Interestingly , recent work suggests that the speciﬁc internalization route of a signaling receptor can lead to distinct signaling outcomes [ 5 , 6 ] . Despite the importance of the question , studies of inter - nalization routes in animal tissues have been hampered by the expectation that regulators such as dynamin and clathrin are required for cell viability . This has prevented thorough genetic analysis , and accordingly our understanding of how surface internalization regulates metazoan signaling and development is incomplete . MENE ( 2L ) - A and MENE ( 3R ) - D Identify Genes That Regulate an Early Stage of Endocytosis Drosophila is a valuable system to study how development is inﬂuenced by endocytosis , and identiﬁcation of mutants that selectively inactivate endocytic internalization routes would provide a means to investigate how these routes impact cell - cell signaling . To identify such mutants , we examined comple - mentation groups isolated in a screen for neoplastic tumor phenotypes [ 7 ] in eye imaginal discs consisting predominantly of homozygous mutant cells ( hereafter referred to as mutant discs ) . We compared the subcellular localization of Notch to cortical actin . Notch undergoes constitutive endocytosis ; when any step of the endocytic pathway is disrupted , Notch accumulates and marks the point of blockage . Discs from two complementation groups ( MENE ( 2L ) - A and MENE ( 3R ) - D ) ( Figures 1Ba – 1Cb ) , in addition to infrequent internal puncta , showed strong Notch staining in puncta associated with the cell cortex ( Figures 1G and 1H ) , distinct from the large internal puncta seen in ESCRT mutant cells ( Figure 1F ; [ 8 ] ) and the diffuse subcortical staining seen in Rab5 mutant cells ( Figure 1E ; [ 9 ] ) . This unique pattern of cargo localization suggests that an early step of the endocytic pathway , poten - tially cell surface internalization , is disrupted . MENE ( 2L ) - A and MENE ( 3R ) - D Disrupt Subunits of the AP - 2 Endocytic Adaptor Complex Interestingly , mapping of MENE ( 2L ) - A and MENE ( 3R ) - D placed both complementation groups in regions containing genes encoding components of the AP - 2 complex . Genomic sequencing revealed nonsense mutations in AP - 2 a ( FlyBase : a - Adaptin [ 10 ] ) in four MENE ( 2L ) - A alleles ( Figure 2A ) . AP - 2 a phenotypes strongly resembled those of MENE ( 3R ) - D NN20 , which altered the initiating methionine of AP - 2 m ( FlyBase : AP - 50 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Discs homozygous for a transposon insert in the coding region of a third subunit , AP - 2 s , showed phenotypes that recapitulated those of AP - 2 a and AP - 2 m ( Figures 2A and 2B ) , suggesting that this represents the AP - 2 null phenotype . Disrupting ADE , CDE , and DDE Reveals Distinct Defects in Cargo Internalization AP - 2 controls the internalization of certain proteins from the cell surface ( Figure 2C ) , an endocytic step seldom analyzed with null mutations in animals . Because ADE also requires cla - thrin heavy chain ( Chc ) and dynamin , we sought to examine cells lacking either of these proteins . We ﬁrst sequenced Chc 3 [ 11 ] and found a nonsense mutation within the third coding exon ( Figure 2D ) . We then sequenced shi FL54 [ 12 ] and identiﬁed a frameshift that induced a premature stop codon within the GTPase binding domain ( Figure 2D ) . Imaginal discs homozygous for these putative null mutations showed neoplastic phenotypes akin to those lacking AP - 2 subunits , consistent with a role for endocytic internalization in epithelial * Correspondence : bilder @ berkeley . edu polarity and tumor suppression ( Figures 2E and 2F ) . The role of AP - 2 , Chc , and Shi in cell polarity will be described elsewhere . To compare the internalization steps disrupted by each mutant , we carried out endocytic assays in living tissue with Notch as a cargo . We directly monitored the endocytic popu - lation by following a surface - labeled cohort of Notch [ 9 ] . In wild - type ( WT ) discs , Notch was internalized after 10 min into endocytic puncta ; after 5 hr , almost no labeled Notch was de - tected because it had been degraded in lysosomes ( Figure 3A ; see also Figure S1 available online ) . In shi discs , Notch was trapped in a diffuse pattern at or near the cell surface , and almost no colocalization with endosomal markers was seen ( Figure 3D ; data not shown ) . In striking contrast to shi , most Notch in AP - 2 discs assumed a punctate cortex - associated distribution ( Figure 3B ) ; internal puncta could also occasion - ally be seen ( Figure S1 ) . In Chc discs , similar to shi discs , Notch was trapped at the cell cortex , but an additional population of endocytosed Notch could be visualized in enlarged internal puncta ( Figure 3C ) . These puncta colocalized with the endoso - mal protein Hrs , indicating that some Notch internalization still occurred in Chc cells ( Figure 3E ) ; the endosomal trapping may reﬂect a subsequent requirement for clathrin in endosomal sorting [ 13 ] . The overlapping but distinct phenotypes of the three mutants suggest that although most Notch turnover requires ADE , other populations exist that can be internalized by dynamin - dependent CIE . An AP - 2 - Independent Population of Notch Internalized by CDE Is Competent for Signaling The isolation of null Drosophila mutants that speciﬁcally block ADE , CDE , and DDE provided the opportunity to deﬁne the requirements of these routes in animal development . We focused on the Notch signaling pathway because a particularly rich literature exists concerning its endocytic regulation . We ﬁrst studied the Notch receptor , which showed a clear depen - dence on ADE ( Figures 1G and 1H ; Figure 3B ) . Mutations that block postinternalization stages of endocytosis , including early endosomal entry and subsequent endosomal sorting , strongly perturb Notch activity , though in dramatically different ways [ 14 , 15 ] . This suggests that Notch signaling potential is altered during its endocytic itinerary , but whether particular cell surface internalization routes are required for Notch signaling is unknown . Notch signal transduction can be effectively studied in the Drosophila ovary , where the signal - sending germline cells and signal - receiving follicle cells ( FCs ) are separable by clonal analysis . We have previously shown that Notch entry into the early endosome in FCs is required for transcription of its target hindsight ( hnt ; FlyBase : pebbled ) at stage 6 , when germline Delta expression activates Notch in surrounding FCs ( Figure 4A ) [ 16 ] . To investigate cell surface internalization routes required for Notch activation , we examined Notch signaling in FCs mutant for AP - 2 , Chc , and shi . Consistent with an endocytic requirement for Notch activation , we found that in stage 6 shi or Chc FCs , Hnt was not expressed ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . Unexpectedly , stage 6 AP - 2 mutant FCs showed normal Hnt expression , indicating that the Notch signal had been efﬁciently transduced ( Figure 4E ) . Together with the traf - ﬁcking data , these results suggest that although internalization and degradation of a signiﬁcant population of Notch requires ADE , efﬁcient Notch signaling itself is AP - 2 independent . Interestingly , despite the fact that a population of Notch reached Hrs - positive endosomes through CIE ( Figure 3E ) , reporter assays suggest that this pool is incapable of efﬁcient signaling ( Figure 4C ; data not shown ) . Moreover , unlike other genotypes in which Notch accumulates in an Hrs - positive compartment , such as ESCRT and lethal giant discs mutants [ 14 , 15 ] and constitutively - active Rab5 expression [ 16 ] , Chc mutants did not show ectopic Notch signaling ( Figure 4C ) ; this suggests that sorting by ﬂat clathrin coats [ 13 ] may promote access to the endosomal compartment permissive for Notch cleavage . In contrast , despite the prominent cell surface trapping of Notch seen in AP - 2 cells , these cells contain a population of Notch that is capable of WT signaling ; interestingly , a small amount of endocytic Notch could be de - tected in mutant cells ( Figures S1F and S1F 0 ) . These ﬁndings reveal that although populations of Notch can be internalized through AP - 2 - independent CDE and / or CIE , the AP - 2 - inde - pendent population can support WT signaling levels , whereas signaling cannot proceed without clathrin . Delta Signaling Requires DDE but Neither Clathrin Nor the Canonical Recycling Pathway We focused subsequent experiments on the Notch ligand Delta , which has the best - documented endocytic requirement for signaling [ 2 , 3 ] . Numerous studies suggest that DDE is required for Notch signaling [ 17 , 18 ] , and two models have been proposed to account for this requirement . The pulling force model suggests that endocytosis of Delta bound to the Notch extracellular domain enables Notch S2 cleavage and subsequent productive signaling to occur . The recycling model suggests that initially inactive Delta must be endocy - tosed and returned to the membrane before it is competent for Notch signaling , perhaps because trafﬁc through the recy - cling pathway promotes processing , association with cofac - tors , or appropriate localization and / or clustering . However , Figure 1 .

Arrows indicate Notch at the cortex , and arrowheads indicate internal Notch . Scale bars represent 100 m m ( Aa – Cb ) and 10 m m ( D – H ) . Endocytic Internalization in Notch Signaling 539 evidence for these models is indirect . Examining Delta signaling activity in the complete absence of endocytic regula - tors would reveal routes of endocytosis required for Delta activation and potentially distinguish between the models . We therefore utilized null mutant alleles of endocytic genes to make homozygous clones in the germline , the Delta signal - sending tissue during oogenesis , and assayed Hnt expression in the surrounding WT FCs at stage 6 . We ﬁrst analyzed mutants for the cell surface endocytic regulators AP - 2 , Chc , and shi . FCs surrounding AP - 2 mutant germline clones ( GLCs ) showed normal Hnt expression , demonstrating that Delta activation is AP - 2 independent ( Figures 4F and 4H ) . Though egg chambers containing Chc mutant GLCs showed morphological defects , Hnt expression was observed in most ( 12 of 13 ) cases ( Figure 4I ) , indicating that clathrin is not required in the Delta signal - sending cell . Finally , in shi mutant GLCs , Hnt was not induced in FCs ( Figure 4J ) . Avl - positive endocytic puncta colocalized with Delta in AP - 2 and Chc mutants but only rarely in shi mutant germlines ( Figure S2 ) . These data demonstrate that internali - zation of Delta is required for Notch signaling during oogenesis but that this internalization and appropriate signaling can proceed by dynamin - dependent CIE . The lack of requirement for clathrin in the germline was surprising because Delta activation in other tissues requires the epsin homolog Liquid Facets ( Lqf ) , a clathrin - interacting Figure 3 .

Current Biology Vol 20 No 6 540 endocytic adaptor thought to bind ubiquitylated Delta [ 19 , 20 ] . To test whether Delta germline activation might occur in an unconventional fashion , we generated lqf GLCs . These egg chambers showed no Hnt expression , similar to GLCs of Delta ( Figures 4G and 4K ) . Overall , the common requirement for Lqf in signal - sending cells demonstrates that the egg chamber is not unique with respect to regulation of Delta signaling and indicates that epsin can function independently of clathrin . Finally , we analyzed GLCs mutant for regulators that control postinternalization steps of endocytosis . Virtually all cargoes internalized by ADE , CDE , and CIE trafﬁc through a Rab5 - posi - tive endosome , the compartment from which recognized recy - cling routes emanate [ 1 , 21 ] . Interestingly , in egg chambers containing Rab5 GLCs , Hnt expression occurs normally at the appropriate stage ( Figure 4L ) . Delta is found predominantly near the cortex of Rab5 GLCs , as well as in certain internal Avl - positive structures ( Figure S2G ) ; ultrastructural analysis suggests that the latter represent accumulations of early en - docytic vesicles ( data not shown ; [ 22 ] ) . This result demon - strates that Rab5 function and entry into early endosomes is not necessary for Delta signaling activity . We next attempted to analyze GLCs mutant for null alleles of Rab11 , a canonical regulator of recycling , but were unable to recover stage 6 egg chambers , presumably because of Rab11’s role in biosyn - thesis and / or cytokinesis [ 23 , 24 ] . However , we could recover stage 6 egg chambers expressing dominant - negative Rab11 in the germline ; these showed normal Hnt expression in FCs , indicating that Delta activation is unaffected ( Figure 4M ) . We could also recover egg chambers with disrupted function of Rab11 effectors . GLCs of the sec15 allele 3 , which prevents Delta signaling in sensory organ precursor ( SOP ) cells [ 25 ] , displayed appropriate Hnt expression , indicating that Sec15 is not required for Delta activation in the germline as it is in SOP cells ( Figure S3B ) . Appropriate Hnt expression is further seen in egg chambers with disrupted function of DRip11 and MyoV , which both mediate Rab11 - dependent trafﬁc [ 21 , 26 – 28 ] ( Figures S3D and S3E ) . Finally , we analyzed egg cham - bers mutant for the sec5 allele E13 , which blocks recycling of the Yolkless receptor within the germline as well as E - cadherin in imaginal tissues [ 29 , 30 ] , and again found normal Hnt expression ( Figure S3C ) . Together , these data reveal that germline Delta must be internalized by dynamin - dependent forces but need not transit through the conventional recycling pathway in order to activate Notch signaling . Conclusions In this work , we have used null alleles to block ADE , CDE , and DDE in Drosophila and address the routes of cargo internaliza - tion required for Delta / Notch signaling . Although clathrin and dynamin have previously been posited to be essential for cell viability [ 11 ] , our work reveals that cells lacking these proteins not only survive but can also show tumorous phenotypes . AP - 2 serves a restricted subset of cargo , but clathrin’s and especially dynamin’s involvement is more broad ; it is thought that internalization of most CDE and CIE cargo requires dyna - min activity [ 1 ] . The survival of mutant cells and , in some cases , their ability to internalize endocytic cargo emphasizes the robustness of clathrin - and dynamin - independent endocytic routes [ 1 , 31 – 33 ] . Moreover , although clathrin and dynamin have additional nonendocytic functions , the similarities Figure 4 .

Scale bars represent 30 m m ( B – E ) and 20 m m ( F – M ) . Endocytic Internalization in Notch Signaling 541 between Chc , shi , and AP - 2 cells indicate that these shared phenotypes result from defects in endocytosis . One cargo whose internalization strongly requires ADE is Notch , which accumulates in clusters at the surface of AP - 2 cells . Despite this prominent phenotype , there is no associ - ated Notch signaling defect as seen in , for instance , shi cells . The contrast between this result and the emerging paradigm that endocytosis of Notch is required for its cleavage and acti - vation [ 14 , 15 ] suggests that some Notch must be internalized through AP - 2 - independent routes , which we conﬁrmed by de - tecting rare endocytic Notch puncta in AP - 2 cells . The small amount of internalized Notch seen in AP - 2 cells could reﬂect upregulation of alternative endocytic pathways . Alternatively , it could reﬂect the existence of a pool of Notch , perhaps acti - vated by ligand , that is normally internalized through AP - 2 - independent pathways and can therefore access endosomes to permit appropriate cleavage when ADE , but not CDE , is dis - rupted . Differing entry routes for activated and nonactivated receptors have been described for epidermal growth factor receptor and transforming growth factor b ( TGF b ) receptor [ 5 , 6 ] , and differing subsets of early endosomes are accessed by ADE and AP - 2 - independent CDE [ 34 ] . Our results justify further studies to determine whether cell surface entry routes are yet another step by which endocytosis regulates Notch signaling . Although the role of cell surface internalization in Notch activity has been little studied , there is a well - established but incompletely understood role for internalization in activity of Delta . In addition to demonstrating that Delta can be internal - ized and activated through dynamin - dependent CIE , our studies with mutant GLCs provide critical information to distin - guish between the pulling force and recycling models [ 2 , 3 ] . shi and lqf are required in the germline for Notch signaling , con - ﬁrming that regulation of Delta activity in this tissue parallels that in others . However , Delta internalized in Rab5 germlines can still activate Notch signaling as it can in WT germlines . Whereas loss of germline shi function prevents endocytic pits from undergoing scission from the cell surface [ 35 ] , Rab5 germline cells form many internalized endocytic vesicles , but not early endosomes [ 22 , 36 ] , through which cargoes destined for canonical recycling pathways pass [ 21 ] , suggesting that Delta internalized in Rab5 GLCs cannot access the recycling pathway . The requirement for recycling could not be further analyzed by utilizing null Rab11 mutations , but we found normal Delta signaling in germline cells that express domi - nant - negative Rab11 , with disrupted function of Rab11 effec - tors , and that are homozygous for a mutation that blocks recy - cling of other transmembrane proteins . In the absence of an assay that can determine whether recycling of Delta actually occurs in WT germline cells , we cannot formally exclude the possibility that these mutants provide an incomplete block to any such recycling that might occur . Moreover , our results do not exclude the possibility that recycling is used to promote Delta activity in other speciﬁc developmental contexts , such as in Drosophila SOP cells , where it may serve to enrich Delta at speciﬁc plasma membrane subdomains or promote asym - metric inheritance of Delta [ 24 , 25 , 37 , 38 ] . However , they indi - cate that a basic mode of Delta signaling , used in the simple inductive signaling of the developing Drosophila egg chamber , requires dynamin - dependent internalization , but not traf - ﬁcking through known recycling pathways . These analyses , which utilize endogenous proteins in endocytic mutant tissue in vivo , therefore support the pulling force model of Delta signaling activity . Experimental Procedures Fly Stocks and Genetics AP - 2 a 40 - 31 FRT40A and AP - 2 m NN20 FRT82B [ 7 ] were generated via ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis . AP - 2 a 40 - 31 terminates at amino acid 510 in the trunk region , prior to the hinge and appendage domains , which mediate important functional interactions with cargo and endocytic acces - sory proteins [ 39 ] . P { SUPor - P } AP - 2 s KG0245 [ 40 ] , which contains an insertion at codon 70 , was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center and recom - bined onto FRT82B . Because tissues mutant for putative null alleles of each of the three subunits have similar phenotypes , representative experiments shown performed with the AP - 2 a 40 - 31 allele are labeled AP - 2 . Chc 3 [ 11 , 41 ] truncates the protein shortly after the b - propeller repeat domain and would render any protein that was made unable to interact with other clathrin heavy or light chains [ 42 ] . Molecular lesions in AP - 2 a , AP - 2 m , Chc , and shi alleles were identiﬁed by sequencing ampliﬁed genomic DNA isolated fromheterozygous adultsvia polymerase chain reaction .
