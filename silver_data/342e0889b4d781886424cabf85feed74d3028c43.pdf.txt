D . University of Alabama at Birmingham spezzini @ uab . edu 3 rd SoTL Commons : March 11 , 2010 2 Today’s Presentation Describe an SoTL study on visual analogies . Explain the outcomes of this study . Guide participants in creating visual analogies . Challenging Course Content Linguistics and Phonology Typically , students come to the first [ linguistics ] class session feeling both apprehensive and resentful . They are nervous about having to take the class , and , at the same time , they suspect it will be of no use . No other class , with the possible exception of statistics , triggers these emotions so strongly . ( Freeman & Freeman , 2004 , p . ix ) Challenging Learning Objectives Describe sound production in the vocal tract : larynx , vocal cords , cavities ( pharyngeal , nasal , oral ) , tongue , lips , teeth , alveolar ridge , palate , velum , uvula ; Draw vocal tract structures for producing each sound ; Recognize sounds ( phonemes ) and their variations ; Match sounds with International Phonetic Alphabet ; Identify pronunciation difficulties of English language learners ( ELLs ) ; and Help ELLs improve their pronunciation . Challenging Dynamics New master’s program : ESL Teacher Education New course : Phonology for ESL Teachers New instructor : Had taught related course 15 times ( but in a different country ) January 2004 First of five Saturday classes ( 8 : 00 - 4 : 45 ) Large class : 45 students ( from up to 5 hours away ) Students : Anxious , overwhelmed , despondent “If you continue like this , you’ll get bad evaluations . ” Instructor ( 4 : 45 ) : Requested email feedback 6 Huh ? Is this course going to be hair raising or what ? EEEEEEEEK ! I have never had a class like this before . My brain strained to the point that it couldn’t take in any more information . As I look at my notes , I wonder if I will survive this . I hope I am not in over my head . It scared me half to death . My first reaction was that I had died and been sent to torment . I was so lost . I felt like a foreigner in a world where I didn’t belong . My initial reaction to your course—I had an adrenalin rush . It reminds me of a chemistry class with all those formulas . I consumed most of a bottle of wine before retiring for the evening . 7 I had to change what I was doing Initial changes Immediate ( Sp’04 ) : Adjusted my assumptions Developed handouts , charts , lists Subsequent semesters ( Sp’05 , Fa’05 , Sp’06 ) Alternated with a Tuesday night format Introduced techniques : We’ve been workin’ on phonology Breakthrough : December 2006 University’s faculty development program Master Teacher Seminar Biggest Change Visual Analogies 8 Visual Analogies Harvey Brightman ( 2006 ) Concrete symbols Help both instructors and students Bridge gap between the known and unknown Connect parts : Big Picture Diagram Instructors are able to … Communicate in everyday language Explain complexity simply Improve teaching ( especially from student perspective ) Students are able to … Use familiar image to better understand new idea . Make effective connections to critical thinking , meaningful - integrated learning , increased retention , and long - term learning 9 The chambered nautilus shell is the logo for the SoTL Commons . The self - propelling nautilus grows chamber by chamber , each one larger than the previous one , in an unfolding spiral as it develops steadily over time . The shell ' s elegant trajectory opens outward and its dynamic design is like the persevering , quiet movement of SoTL through the currents of teaching and learning . The SoTL Commons Conference aspires to be a growing , spiraling , lively catalyst for the international momentum of SoTL , encouraging the opening up and opening out of teaching and how students best learn into public conversations and collaborations . The spiraling pattern of the nautilus is found throughout nature . The conference is simply , but importantly , one swirl in the overall SoTL spiraling transformation of the nature of teaching and academic culture Nautilus : : SoTL Commons What is a visual analogy ? 10 Studies about Visual Analogies College students were helped in overcoming writing blocks ( Feild & Graves , 1981 ) . Learning improved significantly - - - when designed properly , used with text , and matched with high structural similarity between base domain / familiar ( analog ) and target domain ( Issing , 1990 ) . Students were aided in understanding math & science – through new representations on computers ( Perkins & Unger , 1994 ) . Greatest gains were experienced by low achievers ( Lin , Shiau , & Lawrenz , 1996 ) . 11 Visual Analogies were most useful in lieu of non - existent visual aids ( Siqueira , Remiao & Azevedo , 1988 ) . A beginning chemistry teacher’s instructional practices changed before and after web treatment with visual analogies ( Lin & Chiu , 2000 ) . Science knowledge and attitudes of pre - service teachers improved , especially with elaborate analogies - - text for explaining similarities ( Paris & Glynn , 2004 ) . Visual Analogy Guide to Human Anatomy . ( Krieger , 2005 ) . Methodology Research Questions ( 1 ) As indicated by exams and course evaluations , how did visual analogies affect learning outcomes ? ( 2 ) As self - reported by students , how did visual analogies affect their knowledge of phonology , ability to teach pronunciation , motivation to learn , anxiety about course content , and attitude towards the course ? ( 3 ) To what extent did visual analogies influence the students’ use of visual analogies in their own teaching ?

Introduced one train analogy at a time . Posted train cars along the wall ( even during tests ) . February 2007 Provided written explanations of similarities . Distributed explanations in class and via email . Tracks = Context ( place , topic , speech partners , etc . ) Conductor = Speaker ( personal characteristics : gender , age , SES , etc . ) Smoke = Suprasegmental Features : stress , pitch , length , intonation , juncture , linking , rhythm Cars = Segmental Features : Vowels & Consonants Coal Car = VOWELS ( energy ) : Each syllable must have a vowel . Other Cars = CONSONANTS ( Different cars = Manner of Articulation ) Box Car = STOPS ( total obstruction of air flow ) Cattle Car = FRICATIVES ( partial obstruction with noisy air flow ) Circus Car = AFFRICATES ( starts as a stop and ends as a fricative ) Grain Car = NASALS ( funny shape with different place for releasing ) Tanker = LIQUIDS ( association with a liquid product ) Flatbed = SEMI - CONSONANTS ( just partial structure of the others ) April 2007 : Student Feedback 29 helpful , useful , great , awesome , excellent ( “loved it” ) 3 fun , interesting , cute 2 seemed somewhat indifferent 2 it didn’t really help This was great ! I referred to it often ! Cute analogy—helped with initially grasping big picture when so much was new and overwhelming . It really helps to understand the overall picture and how each “car” depends on the other . It really helped my understanding . The train helped the difficult information to be more understanding . One of my favorites ! It helped to solidify the concepts . I am a visual learner and the train analogy was very helpful in learning how segmentals and suprasegmentals work together in speech . The visuals made it easier to commit to memory . It helped me learn the concepts very quickly ! Helped in recall for the quizzes . Once explained , it made a lot of sense and was a great resource . It was a little hard to follow at first , but after the initial discussion , it was helpful . An appropriate analogy - - - and I know how hard they are to come by . I prefer to come up with my own analogies . It’s much more meaningful to me that way . 23 Instructional Intervention ( continued ) January 2008 49 students in enormous lecture hall – couldn’t see Converted to Power Point for projecting on screen . Posted on Blackboard for online access . February 2008 Introduced new concepts related to train analogies . Created weather analogies for intonation features . Expanded text for explaining similarities . 24 Copyright ( 07 / 14 / 08 ) : Susan Spezzini , The Fun - Analogy Train : An Introduction to Phonology — Permission granted for reproduction with courtesy line . COAL CAR A Coal Car is like a Vowel System : : - A coal car has coal . Coal provides energy for mobilizing a train . Without coal , a train cannot move . - A vowel system has vowel sounds . Vowel sounds provide energy for uttering a syllable . Without a vowel sound , a syllable cannot exist .

BOXCAR A Boxcar is like a Stop Consonant : : - In a boxcar , the door creates an obstruction with total closure . The door fully blocks the air from flowing from the inside to the outside ( and vice versa ) . When the door is opened , the air is released and flows freely . - In a stop consonant , the articulator ( lower lip or tongue ) creates an obstruction with total closure . The articulator fully blocks the air stream ( which originated in the lungs ) from flowing from the inside ( mouth , i . e . , oral cavity ) to the outside . When the articulator is lowered , the air stream is released and flows freely . / p / / b / / t / / d / / k / / g / STOP CONSONANTS ( in the English Language ) pot ape bot Abe tot ate dot aid cot ache got egg 26 Summer  Fall 2008 Named “The Fun - Analogy Train : Intro to Phonology ” Created 15 visual analogy slides . Developed 15 ppt sets with about 20 slides per set . Threaded train theme throughout the semester .

The conductor’s personal characteristics determine the way he / she conducts the train . - The social characteristics of the setting ( place , topic , formality , conversation partners , etc . ) determine the language variety ( dialect and register ) . The speaker’s personal characteristics ( gender , age , origin , education , socio - economic status , etc . ) determine the way he / she speaks the language . 28 Fall 2008 Anecdotal evidence • Student concerns regarding course content diminished substantially . • Students experienced less anxiety and greater success . • Feedback indicated enhanced abilities and attitudes towards phonology . • Learner factors ( different learning styles and background knowledge ) were being addressed . • Students felt more empowered . • Students reported incorporating visual analogies into their own teaching . Data Collection 30 SurveyMonkey 10 questions : 8 quantitative ( Likert scale ) and 2 qualitative Pilot Study ( February - March 2009 ) Surveyed 31 Students in Tuesday evening courses without analogies ( Fall 2005 ) : 2 responded ( 10 % ) with analogies ( Fall 2008 ) : 4 responded ( 44 % ) Described SoTL design at 2 nd SoTL Commons Adjustments Defined visual analogies . Shortened the invitational email . Eliminated attachments to the invitational survey . Identified current email addressed in advance .

If you wish , please provide comments and / or insights regarding the use of visual analogies for teaching and learning . 2 . If you wish , please provide comments and / or insights regarding the use of visual analogies in courses like Phonology for ESL Teachers . New Information ( abstract ) The use of analogies has always been something that helps me learn new material . Super helpful in learning so much new information ! It was good to have visuals for the new terms . They [ visual analogies ] still help me when categorizing sounds in my mind for the manner of articulation . They [ visual analogies ] are very useful in making abstract concepts more concrete . This was a helpful visual to remember the progression of the course . Retention of Information The visual analogies have also helped the content REMAIN in my head… a very effective technique . More visuals are better ; they helped us remember . A good visual reminder of what we had been learning . I appreciated the visual ; It made it easier to commit to memory . I was better able to associate the phonological categories with sounds and phonemes by the mental images created by the analogies . I think connecting content to visual analogies helps make the content accessible to more learners . Very useful—nice to view repeatedly . This was great ; I referred to it often . Visual Learners I loved the train ! I’m a visual learner ; so it really helped me remember the suprasegmentals . I loved this analogy and pictorial representation of phonology . As a visual learner , I was able to visualize and recall facts on the tests and even in conversation . I tend to be a visual learner so for me the train analogy was very helpful in learning how , although segmentals and suprasegmentals are separate , they work together in speech . I am a visual learner , so I think that visual analogies are especially beneficial for me , and for students like me . Visual analogies are an excellent way to reinforce concepts and to reach visual learners . Helpful for others For me—a fairly straightforward learner , I preferred the charts and graphs [ phonetic symbols and vocal tract drawings ] . That’s how I learn best . I felt very positively about the use of the visual analogies ; however , for me the vocal tract diagrams were most helpful . It is my opinion that they [ visual analogies ] work more effectively for some learning styles than for others . I find them [ visual analogies ] interesting but not essential as I am able to understand the concepts without them . I think they may be very helpful to those learners who struggle with concepts . Though I believe visual analogies are helpful teaching aids , I personally do not use them to learn . I believe it is strictly a personal preference and am aware that they are helpful for many . I remember what the train looked like , but I personally did not use it . It also may have been something as simple as where I was seated in the room [ 2007 ] . Explanations ( textual analogies ) It was not until later in the course that I understood the train . I found it overwhelming the first day with no background in phonology . When analogies mean something , they are very helpful . The train analogy had meaning behind every part of it , and it was logical and helpful . The instructor’s excitement about the train analogy was contagious and allowed all of us to connect with it more freely . Excellent analogy—it worked well with the We’ve been workin’ on phonology song . Anxiety Reduction For me , I found them [ visual analogies ] to be helpful in lowering my affective filter toward the content of the phonology course . They made the content material less intimidating and easier to understand . They are great for reducing the anxiety that sometimes goes along with learning new things . Difficult new vocabulary or concepts are far less intimidating when they are part of a familiar / silly / funny analogy . Long Term Learning Today , I can still see the train and how it was used to explain concepts . It was truly a life saver when learning detailed information . I vaguely remember the train analogy , but I would not be able to tell you much now about it unless you provide some details to refresh my memory . At any rate , I taught a section on phonology to TESOL students , and I was well prepared from having taken the phonology course . No Knowledge about Trains I honestly did not know anything about trains . I imagine I would have caught on faster if the visual analogy had been an airplane or a truck . Not knowing much about trains to begin with , I have to admit that all the different types of train cars could sometimes get confusing . I think a train poster posted in the classroom might have helped a lot for reference purposes . Use of Analogies in own Teaching Phonology for ESL Teachers ( with analogies ) n M SD How often have you used visual analogies in your own teaching ? 1 = never 2 = rarely 3 = sometimes 4 = often 5 = always f % f % f % f % f % Before taking phonology 38 2 . 61 1 . 08 7 18 % 9 24 % 16 42 % 4 11 % 2 5 % After taking phonology 38 3 . 61 0 . 86 1 3 % 2 5 % 12 31 % 19 50 % 4 11 % Before taking the phonology course : M = 2 . 61 , SD = 1 . 08 After taking the phonology course : M = 3 . 61 , SD = 0 . 86 t - test on the numeric values associated with these ratings : Difference between means is significant ( t = 7 . 09 , < . 0001 , df = 37 ) I believe visual analogies are helpful teaching aids . They [ visual analogies ] should definitely be used by all teachers when teaching . I love using analogies because it helps learners connect new concepts to things they already know . Generally I find visual analogies useful , especially for visual learners and / or for those with limited English skills . I find them to be very beneficial for students of all ages . These are useful with younger as well as with older learners . Visual analogies are very helpful whether you’re teaching children or adults ! Visual analogies are quite useful tools for adult learners . Analogies as Teaching Aids I didn’t understand the full impact that visual analogies have on learning until I used them in my phonology course . It was so valuable to use the techniques [ visual analogies ] in our own learning and studying in order to see how well those techniques would work in the instruction of our own students . Educators learn the “how” and the “why” of using visual analogies . The use of visual analogies was not only helpful in regard to learning the material in the phonology course , [ but ] it was a fantastic way to model for us how visual analogies can be used to teach our students . I really appreciated that we were taught the way we are expected to teach . Impact of Course on Teaching Conclusions Visual Analogies … Reduced student anxiety Served as Big Picture Diagram ( Brightman , 2006 ) Common image representing new idea Communication using everyday language Bridge connecting known to unknown Made complex content accessible Provided meaningful understanding Fostered long - term learning and application Improved teaching ( from student perspective ) 56 Tips for Creating Visual Analogies 1 . Identifying a common object 2 . Providing explanations and Maintaining directionality 3 . Naming the visual analogy 57 1 . Identifying a Common Object Chose a difficult concept that you teach . Select an object or visual image that is analogous . Identify similarities between the object and the concept . Make sure it is a commonly known object in your area . Check with others to see if this object is recognizable . Example : I replaced the term “Stock Car” with “Cattle Car . ” 58 2 . Providing Explanations and Maintaining Directionality From Known to Unknown Describe the common object and then the concept Example : First describe the train car and then the sound system . “A coal car is like a vowel system . ” Avoid reversing the direction . Use simple language in describing the analogy . 59 3 . Naming Your Analogy The Fun - Analogy Train The Fun - Analogy Train : An Introduction to Phonology 60 Thank you !
