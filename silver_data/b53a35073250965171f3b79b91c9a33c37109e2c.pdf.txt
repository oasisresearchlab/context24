These models determine the parameters that influence the magnitude of an outbreak , such as contagion and recovery rates . However , they don’t account for individual characteristics or population actions , which are crucial for assessing mitigation strategies like mask usage in COVID - 19 or condom distribution in HIV . Additionally , studies highlight the role of citizen solidarity , interpersonal trust , and government credibility in explaining differences in contagion rates between countries . Agent - Based Modeling ( ABM ) offers a valuable approach to study complex systems by simulating individual components , their actions , and interactions within an environment . ABM provides a useful tool for analyzing social phenomena . In this study , we propose an ABM architecture that combines an adapted SEIRD model with a decision - making model for citizens . In this paper , we propose an ABM architecture that allows us to analyze the evolution of virus infections in a society based on two components : 1 ) an adaptation of the SEIRD model and 2 ) a decision - making model for citizens . In this way , the evolution of infections is affected , in addition to the spread of the virus itself , by individual behavior when accepting or rejecting public health measures . We illustrate the designed model by examining the progression of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in A Coruña , Spain . This approach makes it possible to analyze the effect of the individual actions of citizens during an epidemic on the spread of the virus .

For example , in the case of a virus , it is not acceptable to test its ability to spread in an actual situation , neither in humans nor in animals . The current pandemic caused by SARS - CoV - 2 has shown that not even the first world powers have highly effective systems for epidemiological control . Thus having reliable , fast , and easy - to - adapt tools that would allow simulating a large number of different situations would be convenient to use as an aid in decision - making for the control of several epidemics . As a solution to this problem , models can be used , understood as a simple but useful representation of the system to be studied and that seeks to answer a specific research question . There are numerous ways to define models from different areas of research , but Agent - Based Modeling ( ABM ) has established itself as a common methodology [ 29 ] . Agent - based models represent systems by simulating the actions of their individual components ( agents , which act autonomously ) , and the interaction between them and their environment , allowing complex processes and systems to be solved . These autonomous agents are placed in some virtual environment - it could be a geographical representation or a network of agents - , and they are capable of perceiving changes in their environment , interacting with it and with other agents in the model , and adapting their behavior if necessary , thus allowing for solving complex problems . This type of modeling can be used to represent practically any phenomenon . A key feature of ABM is that it allows us to tackle or study problems related to the concept of emergent phenomena [ 32 ] . This means examining system dynamics that appear from the behavior and interaction of the individuals that make up the system , thus allowing the study of questions related to how the global behavior of society links to individual behavior . An example could be the behavior of ants when searching for food , that can be divided into two states : ( 1 ) it has food and heads towards the hive expelling pheromones along the way , and ( 2 ) it has no food , so it looks for a nearby pheromone trail , if it exists , or it moves erratically until it finds food . For a pheromone trail to be powerful enough to guide an ant , many other ants must discover the food source on their own . The emerging phenomenon is that the hive learns to make a systematic and optimal collection of all food sources from the results of each individual behavior . A classic and standard way of modeling the spread of a virus in a society is through the compartmental model of epidemiology susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered - dead ( SEIRD ) . The SEIRD is a mathematical model that consists of five compartments or states for the individuals of a population at risk of infection : susceptible ( S ) the status for individuals susceptible to being infected , exposed ( E ) the status for individuals that are incubating the virus but cannot transmit it to others yet , infectious ( I ) the status for individuals who can infect others , recovered ( R ) the status for individuals already cured of the virus , and dead ( D ) the status for individuals who have died from the virus . In the study of a virus spread , in addition to the evolution that is extracted from the basic epidemiological model , it is of vital importance to predict the behavior of individuals to face possible policy measures adopted to mitigate this viral expansion . The main problem of the SEIRD model , as well as any other classical epidemiological model , is that the only information that defines an individual is that related to their epidemiological status , and so all those who are in the same state are considered identical . A solution to this problem is integrating the SEIRD in an ABM , allowing each agent in the model to represent a single individual with its characteristics , both in terms of its sociodemographic variables and its epidemic state . The psychological needs of each individual and the importance it assigns to them determine the compliance or not with the measures imposed . In this way , the SEIRD model can include individual properties that may affect viral expansion , from individual actions to specific genetic traces . In this paper , we propose an agent - based model architecture that can be easily adapted to any virus or epidemic that meets the SEIRD epidemiological transition model . To represent individuals , the ABM will use an adaptation of the Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 3 HUMAT [ 4 ] decision - making model , designed in the SMARTEES project 1 under the European Horizon 2020 program , in which an ABM was designed to study the citizens’ acceptance of different social innovations considering individual psychological needs . This model , developed in collaboration with psychologists and sociologists , will serve as the basis for this work with the relevant adaptations to simulate society’s acceptability of preventive measures and their effect on the expansion of the virus . Using HUMAT , the ABM allows to load in its architecture the socio - demographic data of the population to be represented in order to evaluate the acceptance by the society of the preventive measures against the simulated virus . This decision making will depend on the needs of each individual , so to feed the model , in addition to the actual socio - demographic data , it will be necessary to obtain the needs that define the character of each individual . The proposed model will make it possible to analyze the evolution of infections in a human society based on the characteristics of the virus and the individual decisions of each citizen . The document is structured as follows . Section 2 describes the state of the art in social and epidemiological problems . Section 3 explains the adaptation of the HUMAT decision - making model to the agent system for simulating the expansion of a virus . Section 4 defines the adaptation of certain relevant actors ( like policymakers ) to the model and its influence on HUMAT agents . The adjustment of the SEIRD to the model is described in section 5 . Section 6 specifies the representation and mobility of the society in the model . Section 7 describes the interface of the model . While section 8 explains the model execution loop . Section 9 presents an example of adapting the model to the case of SARS - CoV - 2 in A Coruña ( a city in the north of Spain ) and Section 10 includes possible scenarios and results for the example case . Finally , the last section ends with the exposition of the conclusions . 2 STATE OF THE ART Combating pandemics of emergent and re - emergent infectious diseases has been broadly studied by scientists from different fields . However , the problem stems mainly from two reasons : ( 1 ) the continuous and ever - lasting mutations of the viruses , and ( 2 ) the complexity in the disease transmission mechanism [ 35 ] . Efforts have focused on predicting , assessing , and controlling potential outbreaks [ 35 ] . The pandemic caused by COVID - 19 has led to a notable increase in these efforts , so the bibliography found to deal with this virus is very extensive and is growing every day . Similarly , there are many mathematical models available to analyze the epidemiology events , covering statistical - based methods , state - space models ( such as SEIRD and ABM ) , or even machine learning models [ 18 , 35 ] . Therefore , this state of the art cannot be exhaustive and will focus on remarkable publications using similar techniques to the one proposed inhere i . e . , employ either a SEIRD , an ABM representing a SEIRD or a different aspect of the pandemic , or a combination of both . On the first hand , many models have appeared with classical approximations of the SIR or SEIRD models for the COVID - 19 pandemic 2 , thus for the sake of brevity , we will include just a few . Loli Piccolomini & Zama proposed a forced SEIRD differential model for the analysis and forecast of the COVID - 19 spread in Italian regions , using data from the Italian Civil Protection Department [ 23 ] . Ala’raj et al . combined two different mathematical models ( SEIRD and ARIMA , Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average ) to study the properties associated with this pandemic [ 1 ] . Menda et al . used , in addition to the SEIRD , a neural network to predict the infection rate and fit a single model to data from multiple counties in the United States exhibiting different behavior [ 28 ] . However , as already mentioned , the SEIRD model is not sufficient when we want to observe not only the aseptic transmission of the virus , but also how the behavior of individuals influences its spread . 1 The SMARTEES Project Local Social Innovation : https : / / local - social - innovation . eu / 2 At the time of writing , the number of references provided for Google Scholar when looking for COVID and SEIRD is over 19500 . This number is much greater if we look for COVID and SIR Manuscript submitted to ACM 4 Alejandro , et al . On the other hand , the capability of the ABM to represent societies , through the characterization of individuals , allows capturing directly and effectively the expansion of a virus , whether in an animal or human population . For this reason , it is becoming a standard in the simulation of viral spreads and has been used to represent , among others , the spread of viruses such as the H5N1 virus ( avian flu ) [ 3 ] , H1N1 virus ( swine flu ) [ 16 ] , tuberculosis , [ 31 ] respiratory viruses [ 8 ] , or SARS - COV - 2 [ 24 , 37 ] . Silva et al . [ 36 ] proposed a SEIR agent - based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people , business , and government . In that way , they assess the economic effects of seven different scenarios with specific social - distancing interventions ( from doing nothing to lockdown ) . Kerr et al . [ 20 ] developed an open - source model to help project epidemic trends , explore intervention scenarios , and estimate resource needs , with the aim of being capable of informing real - world policy decisions . Hinch et al . [ 19 ] presented an agent - based simulation of the Covid epidemic including detailed age - stratification and realistic social networks , which can evaluate non - pharmaceutical intervention ( NPI ) , including both manual and digital contact tracing , and vaccination programmes . Badham et al . [ 5 ] used the SEIRD model in conjunction with an ABM that allows representing the individual characteristics of each citizen and permits political decision - making by simulating the impact of different preventive measures , such as social distance . However , the common drawback of these works , is that agents are unable to make decisions about their own behavior in these models , i . e . , these models do not take into account the human psychological factor , and assume that all citizens abide by a rule once established , although reality has shown us that this is not the case , either consciously ( seeking social contact ) or unconsciously ( inappropriate use of a mask ) . The behaviour of citizens is well defined by Palomo et al . [ 30 ] , as they proposed an ABM with two well - differentiated submodels , the first one is in charge of the epidemiological evolution through a SEIRD , and the second one defines citizens’ behavior . These citizens have their displacement agenda in the virtual environment , make decisions about which preventive measures they are going to comply with , and their citizen profile is defined by the geographical area in which they are located . One of the main problems with this model is that it ignores social relations , meaning that they do not consider how they affect the evolution of individual needs , and , consequently , how they influence their behaviour . Moreover , a recently published macro - study [ 10 ] discovers the significant importance of citizen solidarity , interpersonal trust and government credibility in explaining the differences in contagion between countries and rules out medical and technical aspects . So all these essential aspects need to be represented in the model . 3 CITIZEN AGENTS The are several crucial components of the proposed ABM : the agents and their environment , the interactions between them , the decisions they make , and the influence of all these on the spread of the virus . In this section we will focus on the main component that is the agents . In ABM , an intelligent agent of the model is considered to be a computational system located in an environment , which can perceive changes in that environment and has the ability to react appropriately and autonomously to these changes . The agents used in the proposed model represent citizens . First , the agents are individualized by using the sociode - mographic characteristics shown in table 1 which were chosen to model the expansion of SARS - CoV - 2 , as it will be explained later . Moreover , according to the psychologists who participated in the SMARTEES project , an important aspect of individualizing agents is the representation of their needs , such as their need for well - being . It is worth highlighting the need of belongingness to the group , which defines the agent’s need to be similar to other members of his group and which will have a special weight in actions that the agent performs . Each citizen seeks to satisfy these Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 5 Table 1 .

One of the factors determined as key for reducing the impact of the pandemic has been individual responsibility . Therefore , in the proposed model , the decision - making of the agent ( citizen ) consists of complying ( or not ) with the preventive measures imposed by the authorities to limit the spread of the virus . To carry out these decisions , these agents are developed from an adaptation of the HUMAT decision - making model which will be detailed in the next section . 3 . 1 Decision - making model : HUMAT HUMAT [ 4 ] is an architecture designed for the construction of artificial populations , where each agent makes its own decisions based on its needs and the influence of its social network . In this model , decision making , social interactions , and agent cognition are based on social science theories . The agent’s decision - making process is divided into four phases that are constantly repeated during the model’s life cycle , as can be seen in figure 1 . Each of these phases will be discussed in detail below . 3 . 2 Phase 1 : Evaluate behavioural alternatives The team of psychologists and sociologists - who collaborated in creating the HUMAT model - defined at least two categories of needs that are always present in individuals in their decision - making . The first one is related to hedonism , i . e . , the individual’s need for pleasure , for example , health or comfort . The second one is directly related to the agent’s social network and it is the need for belongingness , which is the human emotional need to be an accepted member of a group . More needs can be added depending on the problem to be modeled . Each citizen values the importance of each of these needs differently in his / her decision - making . Depending on the importance that each individual gives to these needs and how he / she can satisfy them according to the circumstances surrounding him / her , the individual will reach a certain level of satisfaction for each need . In the model , the value of the importance given to each need is in the range [ 0 , 1 ] and the value of satisfaction of each need will be in the range [ - 1 , 1 ] . Manuscript submitted to ACM 6 Alejandro , et al . Fig . 1 . HUMAT decision - making cycle The initial values of satisfaction and importance must be initialized using an external data source such as data obtained from a survey . The evaluation 𝐸 of the satisfaction 𝑆 of a need 𝑛 for a given behavioural alternative 𝑏 depends on the importance 𝐼 given by the agent and is calculated according to the equation ( 1 ) 𝐸 𝑏 , 𝑛 = 𝑆 𝑏 , 𝑛 ∗ 𝐼 𝑛 𝑛 = 1 . . . 𝑁 , 𝑏 = 1 , 2 ( 1 ) Those evaluations that result in a positive value ( 𝐸 + ) will be considered “satisfying " while those that have a negative value ( 𝐸 − ) will be considered “dissatisfying " . Evaluations with a value of 0 will be considered “neutral " . A citizen can choose between two behavioral alternatives : accept or reject preventive measures . This decision will be made based on the overall satisfaction of the needs that each alternative is expected to produce . The overall expected satisfaction 𝑂 for a behavioural alternative 𝑏 is given by the equation ( 2 ) . 𝑂 𝑏 = (cid:205) 𝑁𝑛 = 1 𝐸 𝑏 , 𝑛 𝑁 ( 2 ) When one of the behavioral alternatives evokes sufficient levels of satisfaction in one or several groups of needs but also certain levels of displeasure in others , a cognitive dissonance appears . Thus , the level of dissonance generated by a behavioral alternative b ( 𝐷 𝑏 ) is given by equation ( 3 ) 𝐷 𝑏 = 2 𝑑 𝑏 𝑑 𝑏 + 𝑐 𝑏 ( 3 ) where : 𝑑 𝑏 = 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (cid:32)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛 = 1 𝐸 + 𝑏 , 𝑛 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛 = 1 𝐸 − 𝑏 , 𝑛 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:33) 𝑐 𝑏 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (cid:32)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛 = 1 𝐸 + 𝑏 , 𝑛 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 𝑁 ∑︁ 𝑛 = 1 𝐸 − 𝑏 , 𝑛 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:33) If this dissonance exceeds a tolerance threshold , then the agent is faced with a dilemma . A given need generates a dilemma if its evaluation is positive ( 𝐸 + ) where all the others are negative ( 𝐸 − ) or vice versa . This means each of the Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 7 other evaluations individually must be of the opposite sign to that of the given need . Therefore , there could be as many dilemmas as needs . Later we will see which strategies the agent uses to solve the dilemmas . 3 . 3 Phase 2 : Choose preferred alternative Once the citizen obtains the expected satisfaction for each of his behavior alternatives , he chooses the one that produces higher levels of satisfaction . However , if both behavioral alternatives are similar – less than 10 % of the range as a difference – , the agent explores in depth the difference between both alternatives . Scanning happens in the following order : ( 1 ) Exploration of the cognitive dissonance ( see equation 3 ) for each of the alternatives . If this dissonance is different enough ( more than 10 % of the range between both dissonances ) , the alternative that generates less dissonance is selected . Otherwise , the exploration continues . ( 2 ) When faced with a difficult decision , an agent tends toward hedonism , so the hedonistic need is explored . If the difference between the evaluation of the need for well - being between both alternatives is significant , the one with the highest evaluation will be selected . ( 3 ) Finally , if none of the above criteria is applicable , the agent randomly selects an alternative . 3 . 4 Phase 3 : Act The actions available to agents consist of different forms of communication with members of their social networks . When the selected behavioral alternative generates a dilemma agents act to reduce their dissonance and will try to either persuade or seek advice on the benefits of the selected behavioral alternative . Therefore , there are two main types of actions : Inquiring and Signaling . Inquiring involves questioning other agents about their opinion of the preventive measures and its is employed when the agent has non - belongingness dilemma . Signaling consists of informing other agents about one’s own opinion on the measures , and is used when the agent has a belongingness dilemma . In order to simulate as realistic an environment as possible , also from time to time , citizens have random conversations similar to Signaling even if they do not experience any dilemmas . Every time a communication ends , the agents involved reassess their dissonances to see if they have been reduced . The way to select the agent , on whom the action of inquiring or persuading is going to be carried out , depends on several factors : ( 1 ) Existing relationship . The agent to interact with must belong to the same social network . ( 2 ) The current behavior of the agent . In the case of Inquiring , an agent with the same behavior is preferred , while for a Signaling action an agent with the opposite behavior is preferred . ( 3 ) The persuasiveness of the agent sending the message on the receiving agent , that depends on how difficult it was to persuade the agent in the past . 3 . 5 Phase 4 : Experience the effects and update memory The ability of an agent to influence another varies depending on the agents involved in the action , as each citizen has a specific trust value for each agent that is part of his network of influence . However , an agent does not radically change its mind depending on the influence exerted by the agents around . In fact , its own opinion prevails ( taking a value that goes from 60 % to 100 % ) while the opinion of others can only cover the range [ 0 % - 40 % ] . The actual influence oscillates in this range based on two factors : Manuscript submitted to ACM 8 Alejandro , et al . • The trust of the agent that is influenced in the agent who exerts the influence . This trust does not have to be reciprocal between both agents . • The similarity of needs between both citizens , that is , the importance given by them to the different needs is similar . If the evaluations of the need ( see equation ( 1 ) ) of both agents have a different sign , the value of the similarity of needs is 0 . In another case , this similarity is calculated as 𝑀 𝑏 , 𝑛 = 1 − | 𝐼 𝑒 , 𝑏 , 𝑛 − 𝐼 𝑜 , 𝑏 , 𝑛 | ( 4 ) For a maximum influence of 40 % to occur in communication , it is necessary that the needs of both agents are identical and that the trust of the agent receiving the communication in the agent that carries it out is maximum . On the other hand , if the needs are completely different or there is not even the slightest trust , communication will have a minimum influence of 0 % . The final persuasion of the agent that is trying to influence is calculated as 𝑃 𝑏 , 𝑛 = 𝛼 ∗ 𝑇 ∗ 𝑀 𝑏 , 𝑛 ( 5 ) where T is the trust of the influenced agent on the influencer and 𝛼 ∈ [ 0 , 0 . 5 ] is an arbitrary number that ensures that the agent’s previous opinion weighs more in its final satisfaction than the opinion received during the communication 3 . The new satisfaction N value is calculated using the equation ( 6 ) . Where b is the behavioural alternative , n is the need , S the need satisfaction , I the importance o the influencing agent , and e the influenced agent . 𝑁 𝑏 , 𝑛 = ( 1 − 𝑃 𝑏 , 𝑛 ) ∗ 𝑆 𝑏 , 𝑛 , 𝑒 + 𝑃 𝑏 , 𝑛 ∗ 𝑆 𝑏 , 𝑛 , 𝑜 ( 6 ) where S is the previous satisfaction of the need . Once an action ends , the dissonances are re - evaluated with the updated satisfaction values . 4 CRITICAL NODES The model may also include some critical nodes , those are agents representing groups or institutions that may have a relevant role in the evolution of the acceptability of preventive measures by citizens , such as the city council , the press or other media , or the political opposition . These agents have motivations that do not have to be aimed at reducing the effect of the pandemic . A critical node has its own social network , and only the agents in it can be influenced by a direct communication from the critical node . It is generated as a random network during model initialization and its size is defined in the configuration file of each critical node . On the other hand , citizens have a certain trust value in each critical node that determines the strength of the influence that node can exert . Each critical node has its strategy aimed at achieving its own goals . The only action these nodes can carry out is to communicate with citizens , so these strategies are reduced to attempts to influence the opinion or behavior of citizens . The communications carried out by the critical nodes are defined by the following parameters : • Main critical node : the node that initiates the communication . • Orientation of communication : communication can be aimed at promoting compliance with the preventive measures or at showing doubts about their effectiveness and therefore reducing their use . • Dates when communications start and end and the frequency of the messages during that period . • Reach : the percentage of the critical node’s social network which is reached by this communication . 3 0 . 4 has been selected after a calibration process for this model [ 6 ] Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 9 • Secondary critical node : the node that performs the communication designed by the primary critical node . As each node’s network is different , specific nodes may be interested in using the services of another node to increase the range of communications . For example , a denialist association may be interested in using the press to broaden the reach of its messages . Each critical node has a predefined communication plan that tells it when to send a message to a certain part of its social network . This message acts similarly to the agents’ communication ( see ( 6 ) . The P persuasion of the agents upon receiving a communication from a critical node is calculated following equation ( 7 ) . 𝑃 = 𝑇 ∗ 0 . 2 ( 7 ) 5 EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL Besides the ABM , a second system in the model is responsible for simulating the spread of the virus in the modeled society , for which we use an adaptation of the standard SEIRD epidemiological compartmentalized model [ 27 ] . Normally , in a compartmentalized model , a population is divided into closed groups and all individuals belonging to a group are assumed to share the same characteristics as if they were clones . In the adaptation proposed in this work , the individuals ( the agents ) that form a population are treated as unique individuals with their own characteristics and needs . In the SEIRD model , individuals go through a series of epidemiological transitions between the following states : susceptible to the disease ( S ) , exposed or incubation of the virus ( E ) , infectious ( I ) and the two final states that are recovered ( R ) or dead ( D ) . For this work , an adaptation of the standard SEIRD model will be used , dividing the infectious state into 3 substates that allow evaluating hospital pressure : a ) infectious in the community , b ) hospitalized and c ) in intensive care unit ( ICU ) . In figure 2 we can see the transition diagram between states of the epidemic . The transitions between states are assigned a probability of change and a number of days for the transition to be effective . Some of the transitions lack probabilities as they are mandatory transitions . For example , once one reaches the recovered state and gains some resistance to the virus , this resistance wears off over time and a mandatory transition to the Susceptible state is made . The values of the variables affecting the transitions are set through a configuration file that allows the model to be adapted to any virus that complies with the described state diagram . During each cycle of the simulation , the state of the model agents will be evaluated and a transition between states of the epidemiological diagram will be executed , if necessary . 6 REPRESENTATION OF THE SOCIETY An ABM must also represent the environment in which the agents are situated and simulate their relationships with their environment . In this work this involves defining the geographical environment , the movement of agents in this environment , and the social networks in which the agents are related . 6 . 1 Virtual environment First , the physical environment in which the agents coexist must be recreated . Concerning the geographical environment , a two dimensional board of 50x50 cells is used to represent the city through its census tracts . Some of these cells will be associated with places of work , study , essential purchases , or leisure , that is , places of a given relevance in the spread of a virus . It should be noted that each cell represents a large area of the city , so the same cell may contain more than one Manuscript submitted to ACM 10 Alejandro , et al . Fig . 2 . Transition diagram between epidemic states . Boxes represent states and arrows represent valid transitions between states . P - XY is the probability that the transition from state X to Y occurs ; days - XY is the number of cycles that must elapse for the state change to be effective . of these places . Each agent will be located in a single cell and represented by a human silhouette . In Figure 3 , it can be seen an example of this representation in a map divided into sections where the agents are placed , represented in green ( healthy ) or red ( infected ) . The model can load one city or another by changing the shapefile with the census tracts data . The representation of the city is done by its division in census tracts to facilitate the generation of a distribution Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 11 Fig . 3 . Representation of a geographical environment : a map of a city divided into census tracts . Agents are represented in green ( healthy ) or red ( infected ) . that coincides with a real one , both in general demographic characteristics and in its spatial distribution . This spatial distribution is relevant for generating social networks . Secondly , social networks allow us to unite different agents through links and become essential to facilitating agents to interact with each other . These links are directed and weighted , where weights represent the trust that the source agent has in the destination agent . This trust affects their communication ( see section 3 ) . In the model designed , two social networks have been considered : 1 ) the network of neighbors and 2 ) the network of friends . A proximity relationship allows us to form the first social network , that is , each agent establishes connections with the agents who live nearby . We have used the concept of social circles [ 17 ] , which allows for creating a network based on the current distance on the board , ensuring that it is reciprocal between the agents that belong to the network - i . e . , if agent A is a neighbor of agent B , then agent B is a neighbor of agent A . These networks are limited in size , vary its size between individuals , have a high clustering capacity , and naturally recreate a network of neighbors . The configurable parameter social - reach indicates the reach ( in board cells ) that each of these social circles will have . Although networks based on social circles correctly represent neighbors’ networks , they fail to adequately capture the friends’ networks , since it would not be realistic that an entire network of contacts of an agent was living in its cell . To solve this problem , the model has a second social network : the network of friends , generated as a random network with two restrictions : 1 ) there will be a minimum number of links per agent ( configurable parameter numfriends ) and 2 ) these links will be formed based on a homophily relationship concerning the age attribute , i . e . , both agents are in a similar age range . In our case , the homophily condition intends to prevent networks of friends with very different age ranges , for example , an 18 - year - old agent in a network of friends made up of agents 60 years of age or older . However , to make the model more realistic , agents may have relationships with others who are far from their age range with a certain probability random - friend . Thus , it allows to form networks of friends with individuals of very different ages but prevents this from being the norm . Table 2 summarizes the configurable parameters used for the creation of social networks . Manuscript submitted to ACM 12 Alejandro , et al . Table 2 .

Bearing in mind that these cells cover a large enough geographical area , there may be different locations in each one , such as places representing home , leisure , or work . Each agent recreated in the model has a variable referring to its census tract , as can be seen in table 1 . When the simulation starts , each agent is randomly assigned to a location within their census tract . That location will be considered their “home " . In addition , depending on their economic activity , the agent will have another location to carry out its profession . Thus , a worker agent will be linked with a work location , a student with a educational institution , and individuals on unemployment or retirement will not have any assigned locations . Each agent is also randomly assigned to one essential commerce location and one leisure location . During this work , the term contact will be used , not to refer to communication between agents , but to a physical contact between them that can lead to the transmission of the virus . This physical contact may occur beetwen any agent within the same location . The model poses a simplified movement of agents on working weekdays and non - working weekdays . Any day of the week , all agents can have contact with their friends . Furthermore , on working weekdays , worker agents contact with other worker agents in the same place of work whereas non - worker agents will have contact with other non - worker agents in locations of essential commerce . Finally , on non - business days , agents contact with others at their current location , which can be both an essential or non - essential business location . Which days are considered business days or leisure days as well as the probability that an agent is in a location of leisure or essential commerce are fully configurable parameters through a configuration file . 7 GRAPHICAL INTERFACE OF THE MODEL The model proposed in this work has been implemented using Netlogo , a free - to - use integrated development environ - ment ( IDE ) for ABM and multi - agent environments [ 38 ] . Netlogo has a huge amount of freely accessible documentation and sample models . This has been the key reason for selecting Netlogo over other alternatives such as StarLogo TNG [ 21 ] , Mason [ 25 ] or Gama [ 14 ] . In figure 4 we can see the final interface of the model . In the center , there is the 50x50 board representing the city with the agents located in their corresponding cells . There is also a small box showing the current day within the execution . On the left , we see the buttons for the initialization and execution of the simulation and selectors to switch between possible simulation scenarios ( as it will be explained later ) . On the right , there are six graphs that , from left to right , represent : ( 1 ) the evolution of the pandemic ( number of agents vs time in days ) , ( 2 ) the number of communications between agents in the simulation , ( 3 ) the acceptability level of the measures ; and three histograms with the importance values of each of the needs as well as the satisfaction generated by each of the agent’s behavior alternatives ( accept Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 13 Fig . 4 .

First , the initialization of the virtual environment and the agents : board initialization , generation of the population , construction of social networks . Second , the main execution loop of the model . A graphical representation of the loop can be seen in figure 5 . During each complete cycle of the model , which is equivalent to one day in the simulation , citizens : ( 1 ) move from their location to the appropriate work , leisure , or business location according to the day of the week and the economic activity of the Manuscript submitted to ACM 14 Alejandro , et al .

Model execution cycle agent himself , ( 2 ) they execute the HUMAT decision - making loop ( see figure 1 ) , ( 3 ) if they are COVID - 19 patients , they evolve their status with respect to the virus following the figure 2 , ( 4 ) if they are in the infectious state they can infect other agents in their same location or in their network of friends and ( 5 ) if their social circle has disappeared due to the pandemic , they seek to relate to new agents by generating new links in the social networks of the model . 9 PRACTICAL APPLICATION : ADAPTATION OF THE MODEL TO SARS - COV - 2 IN THE CITY OF A CORUÑA The proposed model aims to be used as a base architecture for epidemic simulations and thus being a tool to study the spread of a virus in a society and the effects of public reaction on the expansion . To illustrate its use , we present an adaptation of the proposed general model to simulate the spread of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus in the city of A Coruña ( northern Spain ) . Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 15 9 . 1 Adaptation of the Virtual Environment to A Coruña city . The first step for adapting the model to the case of SARS - CoV - 2 in A Coruña is to represent the city on the two dimensional board . To do this , we start from the information provided by the National Institute of Statistics ( INE ) that contains the cartographic representation of Spain 4 . In section 6 the mobility of agents between different locations has been described , for example , home - work or home - leisure travel . The locations are distributed in the environment thanks to a configuration file that indicates the geographical coordinates of each location , that is work , college , essential business , or non - essential business . Randomly , each agent is assigned to an essential business location , a non - essential business location , and , if applicable , a work or college location based on its business activity . These locations allow to create meeting points where an agent is likely to be infected outside of their usual network of contacts , that is , their network of friends . Once designed the geographic environment , the social network that links the agents to each other must be configured to finalize the virtual environment as described in section 6 . 1 . To do this , one must set values to the parameters of the table 2 . For this adaptation we used the default values of circle radius , social reach and random friend probability . Remember that the links between the different agents represent the trust that one agent has in the other and , therefore , it is also necessary to establish this value . These links are bidirectional ( if agent A is a friend of agent B , B should be a friend of A ) , but not reciprocal ( the trust that A has in B does not have to be equal to the trust that B has in A ) . Given that there is no information available about the trust that each agent has in the individuals pertaining to his social network , each link has been assigned a value that follows a uniform distribution in the range [ 0 , 1 ] . Once the environment has been configured , the population must be generated , that is , the agents . Next subsection details how these agents have been created . 9 . 2 Population of A Coruña The presented model operates at the level of citizens , so personal attribute information is needed for the entire population of A Coruña to calibrate , validate and apply the model . This information will allow us to test different scenarios of virus containment measures . Table 1 indicates the demographic variables as well as the satisfaction and importance of each need required for each agent . All these data were acquired for a certain number of citizens of A Coruña through a survey . These citizens will be directly represented by agents in the system . However , as the population is larger we have developed a method to complete the model with more simulated agents representing the city , as described below . Generation of real agents . . A survey was considered as an adequate way to collect data from citizens . This survey measures both the situational characteristics ( place of residence , type of housing , etc . ) and the psychological character - istics of the population in the midst of the generated pandemic by SARS - CoV - 2 . A psychologist supported its design and it was disseminated through electronic media and social networks in May 2020 . The survey included questions about the position , for or against , on the preventive measures proposed by the gov - ernment in relation to SARS - CoV - 2 , questions about sociodemographic data ( see table 4 ) , as well as about psychological characteristics of the population or their life situation . The psychological questions were grouped according to the need it refers to and whether it refers to the importance given to that need or to its satisfaction . Finally , an average was made for each need to determine its importance and its satisfaction , except for the need to belong to the group , which is dependent on the individual’s social network 3 . 4 Available at https : / / www . ine . es / censos2011 _ datos / cen11 _ datos _ resultados _ seccen . htm .

However , the number of inhabitants in A Coruña on January 1st , 2021 , is 245 , 468 [ 12 ] , so using only 1 , 275 agents in the model would mean using 0 . 5 % of the inhabitants , carrying possible problems in the calibration of the model and in the representation of its reality . Therefore , simulated agents must be generated to increase the population of the model . Next subsections will explain how to achieve them . Generation of citizen profiles . To generate the artificial population , following the process described in [ 2 ] , citizen profiles were created that relate sociodemographic and psychological data to each individual’s decision on whether or not to comply with the proposed preventive measures . To find this relation decision trees were used , since the solution they provide is easy to explain and to be validated by our psychologist . To train this decision tree , based on the survey carried out , we employed as inputs the variables : gender , age , family , children under 12 years of age , area of the dwelling , type of home , square meters of the dwelling ( reduced to a large or small house ) , economic activity , essential work , and net income . Those variables with multiple classes , such as family and economic activity , were transformed into multiple binary variables following a one - hot encoder scheme . The type of essential work was discarded due to a large number of response values ( more than 60 ) . Regarding to the desired outcome that the decision tree should obtain , the survey included two questions directly related : ( 1 ) is respecting the prevention measures an act of solidarity ? and , ( 2 ) does respecting the measures protect me from contagion ? . The survey asks these questions on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 , thus for training the decision tree , this scale was converted to three possible answers : No ( Likert values 1 and 2 ) , Undecided ( 3 ) , and Yes ( 4 and 5 ) leading to the classes , as shown in table 5 , in which our citizens can be classified . As can be seen in table 5 the sample is highly unbalanced , with a high percentage of the population ( 90 % in the worst case ) supporting the measures . To balance the data , the sampling reduction method random under - sampling ( RUS ) [ 13 ] was applied to the majority class and the oversampling technique Synthetic Minority Over - sampling Technique ( SMOTE ) [ 7 ] was applied to the Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 17 Table 5 . Desired outcomes for the decision tree retrieved from the survey as the main reasons to support the preventive measures .

Decision tree to classify citizens according to the question : Is respecting prevention measures an act of solidarity ? underrepresented classes . Finally , the minority classes Undecided and No were grouped into a single class Reject for the purpose of further balancing the set . Different decision tree configurations were trained for each one of both questions , changing parameters such as the minimum number of samples allowed in a leaf node or the maximum number of tree splits . Finally , the tree with the best performance was obtained using the impurity criterion as a measure to generate a division and impose a minimum value of 35 samples per leaf . For the question , Does respecting the measures protect me from contagion ? , a tree was obtained with an overall precision of 0 . 71 . For the question , Is respecting the prevention measures an act of solidarity ? , the global precision obtained was 0 . 76 . Finally , the latter was selected for having the best overall accuracy . The resulting tree is shown in Figure 6 . Notice that each branch that leads to a leaf node of the tree defines a citizen profile . For example , if we follow the left branch of the tree in the figure 6 , we will see that a profile that rejects the measures is that formed by people under 24 years of age who live with their partner and do not have children . From this decision tree , we concluded that the most relevant variables that determine the profiles of the people who accept or reject the measures are : age , type of family unit , net income , whether or not they live in a rural house , whether or not they carry out an essential job and whether or not they are in a paid employment . Based on the profiles determined by the tree , more agents will be created to complete the population , as explained below . Manuscript submitted to ACM 18 Alejandro , et al . Generation of simulated agents . The simulated agents were generated using three different the census data of A Coruña , the survey , and the previously obtained decision tree , as follows [ 2 ] : ( 1 ) Census data provides information on the age and gender distribution for each census tract in the city . Therefore , agents were generated to maintain these proportions for each census section . ( 2 ) The survey data was used to complete the rest of the sociodemographic variables ( see table 1 ) for these new agents . First , for each variable determined as relevant by the decision tree , its distribution in the survey was calculated . To obtain these distributions , the survey data is divided according to gender and the age clusters determined by the tree . For example , to obtain the distribution of the " net salary " variable in the survey , this distribution is calculated in different age and gender clusters , such as women between 25 and 50 years old or men between 18 and 25 years old . Following these distributions the sociodemographic variables of the simulated agents are filled . ( 3 ) Up to this point the simulated agents have values for all the variables except for those related to their needs ( satisfaction and importance ) . Subsequently , these variables are taken from those of the real agents . To do this , each simulated agent is classified , according to its sociodemographic variables , in one or another leaf ( profile ) of the tree . Once classified , their behavior regarding their needs is taken from a real agent randomly chosen among those belonging to the same profile . It should be noted that the leaf nodes are not pure and within the same citizen profile there are people who approve the measures as well as people who reject them . These proportions are also taken into account . 9 . 3 Adaptation of SEIRD to SARS - CoV - 2 The first question to answer before using the basic model proposed in this work is to verify that the virus to be modeled complies with the SEIRD state transition ( see figure 2 ) or if it would be easily adaptable . In the specific case of SARS - CoV - 2 , the SEIRD diagram fits perfectly with the evolution of the virus . A healthy individual becomes infected , goes through an incubation period until it reaches an infectious stage , where it can infect others with or without symptoms , and finally dies or recovers . In addition , when an individual recovers from the virus , he is resistant to it for a time but eventually returns to the initial state where he can be infected again . In addition , the patient goes through the added states in the infectious state , concerning hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit by the patient . Once verified that the stages of virus transmission fit into the SEIRD scheme , the variables in figure 2 must be adapted to the virus . Currently , the pandemic caused by SARS - CoV - 2 is still ongoing , which means that both the reference data and the virus itself , and our knowledge about it , are constantly changing and evolving . For this reason , it is difficult to obtain specific data on the rate of contagion or the duration of the disease in patients . In table 6 we can see each of the values chosen for the adaptation of the transition diagram to SARS - CoV - 2 , citing the scientific - technical publication from which it was extracted . Those values without a reference will need future calibration so that the model faithfully recreates the desired situation . 9 . 4 Model Temporality The model execution , simulating the expansion of SARS - COV - 2 in the city of A Coruña , cover approximately the period between the beginning of August 2020 and the end of the same year . These dates coincide , respectively , with both the second wave in A Coruña and the starting of the vaccination in Spain [ 34 ] . Therefore , the model simulates 150 days where each actual day equals one cycle in the model run . Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 19 Table 6 .

Thus , Monday through Friday are considered working days and workers or students will go to their job or class , while Saturday and Sunday will be non - working days and citizen agents will be distributed between essential and non - essential points of commerce . The probability that an agent visits a non - essential place of business is defined by a configurable parameter with a default value of 0 . 25 . 10 EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS We propose three different scenarios to demonstrate the adaptability of the model to the different degrees of virus containment measures : ( 1 ) a lax scenario without any measure , ( 2 ) a very restrictive scenario with total confinement , and ( 3 ) a more realistic scenario that considers some preventive measures that governments applied . The number of simulated agents is 11 , 646 , representing approximately 5 % of the population of A Coruña . The proportion of infected agents was the one at the beginning of the second wave in A Coruña ( August 2020 ) . 10 . 1 First scenario : no measures In the first scenario , the simulations are carried out without taking into account any preventive or containment measures using the SEIRD model adapted for SARS - CoV - 2 as already described . In this scenario , the critical nodes are not taken into account since , as there are no preventive measures , it is not possible to influence the citizens on them . In figure 7 we can see the average results of the simulation of the model for 10 executions . The graph reflects the number of agents in each state of the SEIRD model for each day of the period the model was run : number of infected ( red ) , exposed ( yellow ) , hospitalized ( purple ) , ICU ( brown ) , recovered ( blue ) , and dead ( gray ) . The evolution of hospitalized , in the ICU , and dead citizens is shown in more detail in figure 9 . We can observe , from graph 7 , that the entire population is infected in a couple of months if no restrictive measure is applied to control the epidemic : in Manuscript submitted to ACM 20 Alejandro , et al . Fig . 7 . Evolution of the epidemic in the 1st scenario Fig . 8 . Evolution of the epidemic in the 2nd scenario Fig . 9 . Evolution of hospitalized patients in the 1st scenario Fig . 10 . Evolution of the epidemic in the 3rd scenario Fig . 11 . Evolution of the epidemic in the proposed alternative scenarios . The first scenario ( a ) is a scenario free of preventive measures ; hospital inflows and deaths in this scenario are represented in a new graph ( b ) to facilitate readability . The second example ( c ) recreates a very restrictive situation . Finally , scenario 3 ( d ) exemplifies an intermediate situation where some preventive measures are in place . mid - September , a peak of more than 6 , 000 infected inhabitants ( around 50 % of the population ) is reached and , after two months , practically all the agents have recovered from the disease . Also , in graph 9 it can be observed that deaths and serious hospitalizations increase during the peak of the pandemic , as expected . 10 . 2 Second scenario : quarantine For the second scenario , the simulation interval is the same as in the previous scenario but declares a state of complete confinement . Accordingly , the behavior of the agents will be modified as follows : • Only citizens who have an essential job will go to the work location . • Non - essential commerce locations will remain closed . • Compliance with security measures at essential business locations will be mandatory . • Agents will be in quarantine , so they will have no chance to spread the virus to their network of friends . Since communications are maintained , they continue to influence each other . • Citizens that decide not to comply with the measures will hold meetings with the members of their network of friends who also do not comply with the measures . Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 21 • The probability of contagion is reduced compared to the scenario without measures using a P - SE of 0 . 05 . In this scenario , the critical nodes could be used , but in Spain the stages of total confinement were strongly monitored by the state security forces , making massive non - compliance impossible . In figure 8 we can see the average results of 10 simulations for this scenario . The evolution of the infected graph is in lower values than in the previous scenario , demonstrating the effectiveness of more restrictive measures . If we look at the red line , representing the number of infected , we can see that the growth is gradual and practically non - existent compared to scenario 1 . 10 . 3 Third scenario : Application of Preventive Measures At this stage , preventive measures are those imposed by the Government of Spain when the strict lockdown ended and include the mandatory use of a mask on the street and in closed rooms , a safety distance of 1 . 5 meters , and capacity control inside premises [ 11 ] . In addition , individual confinement is contemplated in case of testing positive in an antigen or polymerase chain reaction test ( PCR ) or being in contact with a positive one recently . To represent these measures in the model it is necessary to apply some changes to the epidemiological transition diagram : ( 1 ) First , to reflect the probability of the transition between the states Susceptible and Infected in this scenario we used three different probabilities : • P - SE . The probability of contagion of an individual who does not respect prevention measures . • P - SE - no - essential - business . The probability of contagion of an individual who respects prevention measures at a non - essential business location . • P - SE - accepting . The probability of contagion of an individual who respects prevention measures at a essential business location . The reason to consider these last two probabilities separately is because , in general , in essential businesses the requirement to comply with the measures is greater and , therefore , the probability of contamination is lower . ( 2 ) Second , a new substate of the Infectious state called Quarantine is added , as an agent in this state cannot infect others . In this scenario , an agent will enter quarantine 3 days after entering the infectious state , and will leave quarantine when they recover or decide not to follow prevention measures . As an exception , some agents are asymptomatic , and they are not in quarantine because they are not aware of being infected . For this adaptation , the percentage of asymptomatic patients is 40 % [ 26 ] . In graph 10 we can see the average results of the simulation of the model for 10 executions . If this graph is compared with the graph 8 of the second scenario , we can see that the preventive measures work slightly worse than total confinement , but if it is compared with the graph 7 of the first scenario , it can be concluded that the preventive measures are effective in containing the virus . The third scenario is the best example to study the effect of critical nodes on the evolution of the epidemic . Preventive measures are individual responsibility , so the level of acceptance of each citizen affects compliance with them . Based on this scenario , two new ones are designed to test the impact of critical nodes on the behavior and opinion of citizens , including the consequences of these changes on the evolution of the epidemic . In the first alternative , an utopia is assumed where all critical nodes help to alleviate the pandemic’s impact on society . With this aim , two critical nodes are included : the city council and the press . Every five days the City Council will send communications to the public in favor of preventive measures through the press . Manuscript submitted to ACM 22 Alejandro , et al . Fig . 12 . Evolution of the epidemic in scenario 3 Fig . 13 . Evolution of the epidemic in scenario 3A Fig . 14 . Evolution of hospitalized patients in scenario 3B Fig . 15 . Evolution of the epidemic : ( a ) scenario 3 , ( b ) variation in which there is only influence in favor of the measures , ( c ) variation in which the critical nodes influence for and against the measures . In the second alternative , a more realistic situation arises where we have two main critical nodes : the city council that launches communications in favor of the measures , and the political opposition that intends to influence against the use of preventive measures 5 . Again , both nodes send their communications every 5 days through press . In the figure 15 , we can see a comparison between the original scenario 3 and its alternatives with critical nodes in operation . Scenario 3A is where the critical nodes only influence in favor of the measures , causing greater adherence by the community , which results in greater containment of the virus . However , in scenario 3B there are nodes for and against the measures . That causes a drop in acceptability and a lack of control in the evolution of the pandemic . With these three scenarios , it has been shown that the model is capable of adapting to simulations with different prevention measures . The first example proposes a scenario free of preventive measures where the evolution of infections increases rapidly , whereas the second example recreates a very restrictive situation where infections grow very slowly and very few citizens end up suffering from the disease . Finally , scenario 3 exemplifies an intermediate situation where there are some prevention measures , but citizens lead a relatively normal life . In this simulation , infections are higher than in confinement , but they are far from the situation in scenario 1 . 5 The political opposition raises doubts about the proposed measures , alleging their ineffectiveness compared to alternatives that it would use Manuscript submitted to ACM ABM to Simulate the Expansion of a Virus 23 11 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Classic epidemiological models allow studying the spread of a virus in a society , but ignore the specific characteristics of the individuals that make it up . Agent - based models can be a solution since they allow individuals to be represented based on their own characteristics , permitting the study of the impact of their actions on the global spread of contagion . In addition , there are socio - psychological issues and circumstances of the individual’s environment , normally not included in the classic models of expansion , that influence this attitude . The agent - based model that has been presented proposes a general architecture that allows to consider these issues that have proven to be of great importance in pandemic situations such as that of COVID - 19 , in which the attitude of citizens as well as interpersonal trust and government credibility has proven to be decisive in containing the virus . In summary , the ABM architecture has been proposed that is easily adaptable to any population or virus and whose main characteristics are : • It uses an adaptation of the SEIRD model to simulate the spread of the virus . • It uses the HUMAT decision - making model to evaluate the possible behavior alternatives of citizens against the preventive measures proposed in each possible simulation scenario . • It establishes two social networks ( friendship and neighborhood ) that will influence the decision - making of each citizen and determine links between them that allow the spread of the virus . • It evaluates the effect of communications made by groups or institutions on the behavior of citizens and the effect that this change of behavior has on the epidemiological evolution . • It places citizens in a 2D virtual environment that represents the city or region affected by the virus . • It considers mobility of citizens ( between home and work / study or leisure areas ) which , through a relationship of proximity , can favor the spread of the virus . The operation of the model and its possibilities of adaptation have been illustrated with the case of the expansion of SARS - CoV - 2 in the city of A Coruña . The execution of the chosen scenarios , which range from strict confinement to not applying any preventive measure , denotes the adequacy of the model to represent the behavior of a population and its reactions . Therefore , it is a useful tool to test different containment policies and thus find the best balance between the harshness and effectiveness of the measure , partly determined by the adherence that it is capable of generating in the population . However , its complexity leaves us open lines for future work . Among all of them , it is worth mentioning : • The adaptation of the SEIRD model involves a large number of parameters ( see Table 6 ) . In addition , many of the values established for some of these parameters are open to question , since the information available on the behavior of SARS - CoV - 2 ( with its respective variants ) has not stopped being updated day by day . For all these reasons , carrying out an adequate calibration , and exhaustively analyzing these parameters , is a very complex and time - consuming task ( around thousands of hours as simulation of the A Coruña model lasts approximately 15 hours ) . • The mobility of citizens can determine the spread of some viruses , especially those that spread by air and not by physical contact . For the lack of simplicity , the locations of leisure , work , or home have been established randomly and , likewise , the movements made by the agents between them . It would be desirable to set these locations more precisely and make allocations based on proximity in some cases ( for example , essential business ) . • The agents are the key part of this model and , despite the success of the sample collected trough the survey , it would be desirable to obtain more data in order to have a population that is as realistic as possible . In addition , this would allow the survey to be expanded , including more specific questions and in accordance with the needs of the model that were not initially considered .
