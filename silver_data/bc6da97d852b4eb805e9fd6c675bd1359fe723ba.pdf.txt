Actin filament assembly is critical for eu - karyotic cell motility . Arp2 / 3 complex and capping pro - tein ( CP ) regulate actin assembly in vitro . To under - stand how these proteins regulate the dynamics of actin filament assembly in a motile cell , we visualized their distribution in living fibroblasts using green flourescent protein ( GFP ) tagging . Both proteins were concen - trated in motile regions at the cell periphery and at dynamic spots within the lamella . Actin assembly was required for the motility and dynamics of spots and for motility at the cell periphery . In permeabilized cells , rhodamine - actin assembled at the cell periphery and at spots , indicating that actin filament barbed ends were present at these locations . Inhibition of the Rho family GTPase rac1 , and to a lesser extent cdc42 and RhoA , blocked motility at the cell periphery and the formation of spots . Increased expression of phosphatidylinositol 5 - kinase promoted the movement of spots . Increased expression of LIM—kinase - 1 , which likely inactivates cofilin , decreased the frequency of moving spots and led to the formation of aggregates of GFP—CP . We con - clude that spots , which appear as small projections on the surface by whole mount electron microscopy , repre - sent sites of actin assembly where local and transient changes in the cortical actin cytoskeleton take place . Key words : actin assembly ¥ Arp2 / 3 complex ¥ cap - ping protein ¥ cell motility ¥ Rho family GTPase A ctin polymerization is a necessary event for many cellular movements . Classic photobleaching and photoactivation studies of motile cells showed that incorporation of actin monomer occurs predominantly near the leading edge ( 58 , 59 , 64 ) where actin filaments are short , branched , and have their fast - growing barbed ends oriented toward the membrane ( 33 , 56 ) . In addition , stud - ies using pharmacologic inhibitors of actin polymerization ( 9 , 19 , 69 ) and studies of permeabilized cells ( 24 , 47 , 57 ) support the view that actin polymerization at free barbed ends creates a propulsive force that pushes forward the lamella of migrating cells ( for review see ref . 39 ) . The next challenges for understanding how actin dynamics contrib - utes to cell motility is to observe the relationship in live cells and to define the molecular mechanism . Two models for initiating actin assembly at the leading edge are elongation of existing actin filaments at newly created free barbed ends or creation of new actin fila - ments with free barbed ends that subsequently elongate . These models are not mutually exclusive . Both models re - quire a mechanism for generating free barbed ends . In the latter model , a mechanism for the formation of new fila - ments having free barbed ends is required , because the rate of spontaneous actin oligomer formation is slow at the concentration of free actin monomer in cells . One likely candidate for a factor that promotes de novo assembly is the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 37 , 45 , 65 , 66 , 68 ) , which nucleates the formation of actin filaments that elongate only at the barbed end ( 44 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex remains bound at the pointed ends of filaments and also binds along the sides of filaments . Thus , Arp2 / 3 complex could create new actin filaments that could anchor via their pointed end to the existing filament network such that elongation at their barbed ends could propel the membrane forward ( 44 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex , together with the Listeria surface protein ActA , promotes the assembly of actin filaments ( 67 ) . In yeast , the Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for viability and nec - essary for the movement of cortical actin patches ( 41 , 68 ) . In the model where assembly occurs on existing fila - ments , free barbed ends are proposed to be generated by severing filaments or by uncapping actin filament barbed ends . Support for actin filament severing comes from stud - Address correspondence to D . A . Schafer , Department of Cell Biology and Physiology , Washington University School of Medicine , 660 S .

On the other hand , capping protein ( CP ) 1 is readily removed from barbed ends in vitro by phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - biphos - phate ( PI 4 , 5 - P 2 ) ( 52 ) , therefore , PI 4 , 5 - P 2 in the mem - brane may induce localized uncapping of actin filaments close to the membrane . Capping protein is a potent barbed end capper as well , and much evidence suggests that cap - ping protein functions to block barbed end growth and limit actin polymerization in vivo ( 14 , 16 , 26 , 51 ) . Since Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein affect actin assembly in vitro by different mechanisms and both are important for actin assembly in vivo , we reasoned that flu - orescent probes of Arp2 / 3 complex and CP would reveal distinct features of actin assembly in motile cells . We pre - pared these probes using green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) tagging and analyzed their distributions in live cells under varying conditions that modulate cell motility . The distri - butions of the GFP - tagged proteins were identical to those of endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein . Both GFP—Arp2 / 3 complex and GFP—CP were enriched at mo - tile regions of the leading edge suggesting that both Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein regulate actin dynamics at the leading edge . Unexpectedly , GFP—Arp2 / 3 complex and GFP—CP also were observed in dynamic structures at sites away from the cell periphery , in small spots scattered throughout the lamella . These localized sites of actin as - sembly may occur where transient changes in the cortical actin cytoskeleton are required for cellular events such as endocytosis , exocytosis , or signaling . Materials and Methods cDNA Constructs , Antibodies , and Reagents The expression plasmid for GFP—CP was constructed from pEGFP - C1 ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) and a cDNA encoding mouse CP - (cid:98) 2 ( 53 ) .

Rhodamine - labeled sec - ondary antibodies were purchased from Chemicon ( Temecula , CA ) . Rhodamine dextrans were purchased from Sigma . Cell Lines PtK1 fibroblasts were transfected using lipofectamine ( GIBCO BRL , Gaithersburg , MD ) according to the manufacturer(cid:213)s instructions and se - lected in media containing 1 mg / ml G418 . Clones were screened by fluo - rescence microscopy and immunoblotting ( 29 , 61 ) . Cell lines were main - tained in media containing 0 . 5 mg / ml G418 . Quantitative Immunoblotting To determine the level of expression of the GFP - tagged proteins , whole cell extracts of each cell line , including the parental PtK1 cells , were pre - pared in SDS sample buffer . The extracts were subjected to electrophore - sis and immunoblotting with antibodies to capping protein (cid:98) 2 - subunit or anti - Arp3 . The immunoblots were developed as described ( 18 ) and scanned to obtain a digital image . The intensity of the bands on the blot corresponding to the endogenous and GFP - tagged proteins were quanti - tated using NIH Image . Rhodamine - Actin Incorporation in Permeabilized Cells Incorporation of rhodamine - actin in saponin - permeabilized cells was per - formed as described ( 57 ) . Rhodamine - actin ( Cytoskeleton , Denver , CO ) at 0 . 45 (cid:109) M in 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 138 mM KCl , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mg / ml saponin , 1 mM ATP , and 1 % BSA was added to cells plated on coverslips . Latrunculin A ( 1 (cid:109) M ) or cytochalasin D ( 5 (cid:109) M ) were added to some samples . After 5 min in the presence of rhodamine - actin , the permeabilized cells on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in 3 % paraformaldehyde in 127 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 . 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 4 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 . 5 mM glucose , 1 mM EGTA , and 20 mM Pipes , pH 7 . 3 , rinsed in the same buffer containing 10 mM ethanolamine , and then mounted for microscopy . Microscopy Live cell imaging was performed using an intensifier silicon - intensifier tar - get tube ( ISIT ) camera as described ( 62 ) . Cells were maintained at 37 (cid:56) C in phenol red - free and NaHCO 3 - free MEM - Earle(cid:213)s containing 10 % fetal calf serum and 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 0 . For immunofluorescence , cells on coverslips were fixed in 1 % paraformaldehyde in IF buffer ( 127 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 . 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 4 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 . 5 mM glu - cose , 1 mM EGTA , and 20 mM Pipes , pH 7 . 3 ) for 10 min at 37 (cid:56) C , im - mersed in methanol at (cid:50) 20 (cid:56) C for 10 min , and then rehydrated in IF buffer containing 10 mM ethanolamine . Cells were blocked in 5 % horse serum , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 in IF buffer at pH 8 . 1 . Antibodies were diluted in block - ing solution . Coverslips were mounted in 1 % n - propylgallate in 50 mM TrisCl , pH 8 . 5 , with 50 % glycerol . Images were collected with a model 300T - RC ( Dage - MTI , Michigan City , IN ) cooled charge - coupled device camera . Analysis of Spot Movements Spot velocities were calculated by marking the x and y coordinates of the position of each spot in several frames of the video recording . These data were tabulated using Microsoft Excel ( Redmond , WA ) and the total life - time and distance covered by each spot was determined . Statistical analy - ses were performed with the tools available in the Microsoft Excel pro - gram . Whole Mount Electron Microscopy Cells observed by electron microscopy were first observed using fluores - cence video microscopy as described above to record the dynamics of GFP—CP just before fixation for preparation of whole mounts . Cells were grown on coated electron microscopic grids and assembled in a flow chamber for video microscopy . A video recording was made of each cell before and during fixation in 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde , 0 . 1 M cacodylate , pH 7 . 4 , 10 mM CaCl 2 , and 10 mM MgCl 2 prewarmed to 37 (cid:56) C . The sample was kept at 37 (cid:56) C for 10—15 min and then the grid was transferred for 1 h at room temperature to 2 % glutaraldehyde in the same buffer . Samples were postfixed with 0 . 1 % OsO 4 for 10 min on ice , treated with 0 . 1 % tannic acid for 20 min , and then stained , dehydrated , and subjected to critical point drying and carbon coating as described ( 4 , 34 ) . In some cases , samples were treated with 0 . 25 % saponin before postfixation with OsO 4 and stain - ing ( 49 ) . The same cells visualized by video microscopy during fixation were identified on the grid and electron micrographs were prepared . 1 .

Schafer et al . Actin Dynamics in Living Cells 1921 Results Actin Assembly in Living Cells Revealed by GFP - tagged Forms of Arp2 / 3 Complex and Capping Protein To observe sites of actin assembly in living cells , we se - lected stable PtK1 fibroblast lines expressing GFP - tagged Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein and monitored their distributions over time using video microscopy . GFP— Arp3 and GFP—CP were found in two types of motile structures . First , both proteins were concentrated in mo - tile regions of the cell periphery . The dynamics of GFP— Arp3 and GFP—CP at the cell periphery reflected move - ment of the edge of the lamella during extension and ruffling . Second , a surprising observation was the appear - ance of dynamic spots of GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP within the lamella , but back from the cell edge . Collections of im - Figure 1 . The distributions of GFP—CP ( A , C , D , and F ) and GFP—Arp3 ( B ) in living fibroblasts change dramatically over time . Each se - quence of images ( A — F ) shows selected frames from a video sequence demonstrating that the distributions of GFP—CP and GFP—Arp3 change with time . Movies of the complete video sequences for A — F present these data more clearly and are available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu or from the authors . Arrows in C and D indicate the initial position of a prominent motile spot formed in the lamella ( C ) or associated with a macropinosome ( D ) . The distribution of GFP ( E ) is diffuse , as expected . Slight changes in the distribution of GFP over time reflect changes in cell thickness that accompany cellular movements . The sequence in F was obtained using a confocal microscope and shows that the accumulation of GFP—CP at the cell periphery is not due to increased cell thickness at the edge of the cell . Numbers in the lower corner of each image indicate elapsed time in seconds . Bar , 10 (cid:109) m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 1922 ages taken from the video sequences of individual cells il - lustrate the changes in the distributions of GFP—Arp3 ( Fig . 1 B ) and GFP—CP ( Fig . 1 , A , C , D , and F ) in living cells over time . Movies ( Movies 1A—1F ; available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) present these data most clearly . Spots of GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP are components of the same structure because antibodies to subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( including Arp3 , p21 , and p34 ) labeled spots of GFP—CP and vice versa ( Fig . 2 ) . Capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex were nearly coincident in punctate structures in the lamella and at the cell periphery . The accumulation of GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP at the cell periphery and in motile spots is not due to increased cell thickness at those locations . To control for changes in fluo - rescence intensity that result from changes in cell height , we compared the distributions of GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP with those of GFP and rhodamine - dextran , two reagents that distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm . Ratio images of the fluorescence of GFP—CP or GFP—Arp3 to that of microinjected rhodamine - dextran ( 70 kD ) showed that both proteins were specifically enriched in motile regions at the cell periphery and in the dynamic spots ( data not shown ) . In addition , confocal microscopy of live cells ex - pressing GFP—CP confirmed that CP was enriched in re - gions along the periphery and in motile spots ( Fig . 1 F ; Movie 1F available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) . Time - lapse movies obtained using the confocal microscope fo - cused at several planes above the substratum indicated that the moving spots were present on the upper cell sur - face . The dynamic structures we observed are not artefacts of GFP tagging . The distributions of GFP—Arp3 and GFP— CP accurately represent the distributions of endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex and CP , respectively . Antibodies to two components of the Arp2 / 3 complex , p21 and p34 , labeled regions at the cell periphery and spots within the lamella that colocalized with GFP—Arp3 at those locations ( data not shown ) . The analogous experiment could not be done with GFP—CP due to the lack of specific antibodies , however , the distributions of GFP—CP tagged on the (cid:98) 2 - subunit were identical to that of GFP—CP tagged on the (cid:97) 2 - sub - unit . Thus , two different GFP - tagged probes for CP exhib - ited identical dynamics in cells . In addition , GFP—CP ex - pressed in myotubes or cardiac myocytes in cell culture assembled at Z disks as does endogenous CP ( 8 , 54 ) . The distribution of sarcomeric actin in myotubes was not al - tered by expression of GFP—CP and myotubes contracted spontaneously , indicating that the contractile apparatus functioned ( data not shown ) . The distributions of GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP in motile spots also are not artefacts of overexpression of the GFP - tagged proteins . GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP (cid:98) 2 - subunit rep - resented 10 and 20 % , respectively , of the total amount of Arp3 and CP (cid:98) 2 - subunit expressed in the stably trans - fected cell lines as determined using quantitative immuno - blots . Furthermore , the total amount of Arp3 and CP ex - pressed in the cell lines was not increased . The moving spots also were not specific to PtK1 fibroblasts ; other transfected cell lines in which motile spots were observed include mouse fibroblasts , rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells , and MDCK cells . Properties of the Dynamic Spots The majority of spots of GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP ap - peared in the lamella , moved short distances , and then dis - appeared with an average life time of 11 s . The rate of movement of spots of GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP were not significantly different ; spots of CP and Arp3 moved at av - erage rates of 0 . 17 (cid:109) m / s ( SEM 0 . 01 , n (cid:53) 24 ) and 0 . 14 (cid:109) m / s ( SEM 0 . 01 , n (cid:53) 12 ) , respectively . The direction of spot movement appeared random relative to the cell edge and to the location and movement of other spots . In some cases a single spot diverged into two structures which moved apart from one another . In other cases spots co - alesced into a single structure , which then continued to move . In rare instances , spots were trailed by comet - like tails similar to the actin structures assembled by moving Listeria monocytogenes ( Fig . 1 C , arrow ; Movie 1C avail - able at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) . Spots also were observed moving along the periphery of macropinosomes , which appeared as dark , round struc - tures ( Fig . 1 D , arrow ; Movie 1D available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) ; these organelles were identified as macropino - somes based on their uptake of rhodamine - dextran from the media ( data not shown ) . Compared with the short - lived spots moving in the lamella , spots associated with macropinosomes persisted throughout the entire observa - tion period ( (cid:46) 1 min ) and moved along the organelle mem - Figure 2 .

Schafer et al . Actin Dynamics in Living Cells 1923 brane with frequent stops and changes in direction . The rate of movement of spots on macropinosomes was similar to that of the short - lived spots moving in the lamella . Motile spots were most frequently observed in cells of preconfluent cultures in which PtK1 fibroblasts were well spread , but were not actively migrating . In contrast , motile spots were less abundant in cells of confluent cultures in - duced to migrate into a cleared zone scratched in the monolayer ( Fig . 3 ; Movies 3A and 3B available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) . The migrating cells extended a broad flat lamella that was nearly devoid of spots ; GFP— Arp3 and GFP—CP were enriched at the leading edge of the lamella . Thus , the appearance and movement of spots was suppressed in actively migrating cells . Actin Assembly Drives Motility at the Cell Periphery and at Spots To confirm that GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP identify sites of actin assembly , we observed the incorporation of rho - damine - labeled actin in saponin - permeabilized cells . Rho - damine - actin assembled at sites along the cell periphery and at spots of GFP—CP ( Fig . 4 ) . The incorporation of rhodamine - actin was inhibited by latrunculin A and cy - tochalasin D . In addition , treatment of intact cells with 1 (cid:109) M cytochalasin D and 200 nM latrunculin B ( which seques - ters actin monomers [ 11 , 55 ] ) caused spots to stop moving within 2 min , prevented the formation of new spots , and blocked motility at the cell periphery ( Fig . 5 ; Movies 5A and 5B available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) . Two agents that alter actin dynamics , swinholide A ( which binds actin dimers and severs filaments [ 6 ] ) and jasplakinolide ( which stabilizes F - actin [ 5 ] ) , also inhibited motility of spots ( Ta - ble I ) . The effects of all these reagents are consistent with the hypothesis that actin polymerization is required for spot motility and for motility at the cell periphery . If actin polymerization is necessary for spot motility , then filamen - tous actin should also be a component of spots . Actin , as detected using anti - actin ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) or rhodamine - phalloidin ( Fig . 6 C ) , colocalized with GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP in spots and at the cell periphery . Other proteins that regulate actin assembly or bind actin filaments , in - cluding profilin , vinculin , WASP , VASP , mena , zyxin , ezrin , myosins IIA and IIB , myosin I , and myosin V were not detected in spots using immunofluorescence analysis ; these proteins were detected at locations expected for each protein based on previous studies . Moving Spots Correspond with Fin - like Projections of the Plasma Membrane Those motile spots in the lamella not associated with mac - ropinosomes were observed in whole mount electron mi - crographs to correspond with structures on the membrane surface that protruded from the cell ( Fig . 7 ) . The struc - tures most often appeared as small fin - like projections that tapered along their length . The structures differed from microvilli , which appeared as finger - like projections with uniform thickness along their length . No vesicles were ob - served in the vicinity of the projections . The increased staining of the structures obtained after brief saponin - treatment ( 49 ) suggests that the structures are dense , con - sistent with the presence of actin filaments . Regulation of Actin Assembly and Cell Motility by Small GTPases and Polyphosphoinositides Small GTPases have been implicated in regulating actin Figure 3 . Spots were reduced in number and spot motility was suppressed in migrating cells . Confluent monolayers of PtK1 fi - broblasts expressing GFP—Arp3 ( A ) or GFP—CP ( B ) were (cid:210)wounded(cid:211) to obtain a clear area on the coverslip . Cells migrat - ing into the cleared region were monitored 2—4 h after scratching . Both Arp2 / 3 and CP were enriched in regions of motile activity at the cell edge . Few motile spots were observed and they were gen - erally restricted to a location at the rear of the extended lamella .

To evaluate the role of small GTPases in spot motility and motility at the cell periphery , we microinjected or expressed mutant forms of RhoA , rac1 , and cdc42 ( Fig . 8 ; Movies 8A—8F available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) . Expression of a dominant - negative form of rac1 ( N17rac1 ) resulted in the loss of spots , a loss of motility at the periphery of the cell , and a concomitant diffuse distribution for both GFP—CP and GFP—Arp3 ( 12 out of 13 cells ) ( Fig . 8 B ; Movie 8B available at www .

Expression of a dominant - negative form of cdc42 ( N17cdc42 ) ( Fig . 8 D ; Movie 8D available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) or injection of Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin ( Fig . 8 F ; Movie 8F available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) resulted in a similar diffuse dis - tribution for GFP—Arp3 in most cells , however , the effect was not as complete as with N17rac1 with a few spots re - maining in some cells . Expression of activated forms of rac1 ( v12rac ) ( Fig . 8 A ; Movie 8A available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) or cdc42 ( V12cdc42 ) ( Fig . 8 C ; Movie 8C available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) or microinjec - tion of activated RhoA ( v14RhoA ) ( Fig . 8 E ; Movie 8E available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) did not alter the dis - tributions of the GFP - tagged proteins or motility of spots . These results suggest that the small GTPases , RhoA , cdc42 , and especially rac1 , participate in the formation and movement of spots and in motility at the cell periphery . Polyphosphoinositides have been implicated as media - tors of actin assembly ( 27 ) , and as effectors of Rho GTP - ases ( 24 , 60 ) . To investigate the role of polyphosphoino - sitides in spot motility , we overexpressed type 1 alpha PI 5 - kinase . PI 5 - kinase catalyzes the synthesis of PI 4 , 5 - P 2 , and phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PI 3 , 4 , 5 - P 3 ) , which may increase actin polymerization by effects on ac - tin - binding proteins ( 27 ) . In cells expressing PI 5 - kinase , long - lived spots of GFP—CP and GFP—Arp3 having an av - erage lifetime of 18 . 5 s moved through the cytoplasm at an average rate of 0 . 33 (cid:109) m / s ( SEM 0 . 05 , n (cid:53) 12 ) , twofold greater than spots in the lamella of control cells ( Fig . 9 ; Movie 9 available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) . Wort - mannin , an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinases , did not affect the motility of spots in the lamella when tested at concentrations ( 100 nM for up to 30 min ) that alter 3 - phosphoinositide levels in other systems . Together , these data suggest that 5 - phosphoinositides , but not 3 - phos - phoinositides , participate in the assembly of F - actin in cells . Role of Other Proteins in Spot Motility Several recent studies implicate cofilin , which promotes actin filament depolymerization , as a regulator of actin dynamics in vivo . Phosphorylation of cofilin at Ser - 3 inac - tivates cofilin ( 1 , 43 ) via the activity of LIM—kinase - 1 ( LIMK - 1 ) ( 2 , 70 ) . To investigate a role for cofilin in motil - ity of spots and the cell periphery , we expressed LIMK - 1 in cells expressing GFP—CP . Expression of LIMK - 1 re - sulted in the loss of motility at the cell periphery and a decrease in the motility of GFP—CP spots in 11 out of 14 injected cells ( Fig . 10 A ; Movie 10A available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) . In a majority of cells expressing LIMK - 1 , aggregates of GFP—CP accumulated . In contrast , expression of a mutant form of LIMK - 1 that lacks a por - tion of the catalytic kinase domain had little effect on the motility of spots or movements at the cell periphery ( Fig . 10 B ; Movie 10B available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu ) . These data suggest that cofilin participates in the actin fila - ment dynamics required for movement of spots and for motility at the cell periphery . To determine whether or not myosin motor activity was necessary for spot motility , we treated cells with butanedi - one monoxime ( BDM ) , which inhibits the ATPase activity of myosins ( 12 ) and with KT5926 , which inhibits myosin light chain kinase ( 46 ) . Spots continued to move in cells treated for 15 min in 10 mM BDM , a concentration known to inhibit postmitotic cell spreading and whole cell motility in fibroblasts ( 12 ) . KT5926 at 160 nM for up to 60 min also did not effect spot motility . These results , together with the absence of several myosins from spots by immunofluo - rescence analysis , suggest that myosins are not involved in spot motility . Whether or not BDM or KT5926 inhibit all unconventional myosins is not known , thus , these results do not rule out the participation of all myosins . A summary of the effects on spot motility and motility at the cell periphery of all agents tested is presented in Ta - ble I . Each agent was used at concentrations and durations Figure 6 .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 1926 known to be effective in other studies . Agents that did not affect spot motility or motility at the cell periphery in - cluded the protein phosphatase inhibitor , okadaic acid , the tyrosine kinase inhibitor , genistein , and two agents that disrupt microtubule function , taxol and nocodazole . De - pletion of serum from the culture medium for 24 h did not suppress motility of spots or the cell periphery in PtK1 cells and addition of the growth factors EGF and PDGF to serum - starved cells did not enhance the motility . Phorbol 12 - myristic acetate ( PMA ) stimulated cell spreading and the accumulation of GFP—CP at the cell periphery , but motile spots continued to be observed in the lamella for up to 60 min after addition of PMA . Discussion The dynamic distributions of GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP re - vealed the nonsteady - state behavior of actin assembly in living cells . Actin assembled at the cell periphery to extend the lamella and create ruffles . Actin assembly also oc - curred throughout the lamella at small spots that likely represent dynamic regions of the cortical actin cytoskele - ton . The GFP - tagged proteins are valuable new tools for observing where actin assembles and investigating how ac - tin assembly is controlled in living cells . Other methods for observing actin assembly in living cells , such as pho - tobleaching of rhodamine - actin ( 63 ) and photoactivation of (cid:210)caged(cid:211) actin ( 58 ) , two techniques that require microin - jection of modified actin , did not reveal these novel sites of actin assembly . The motile spots , which were observed in several different types of cells , may prove to be as useful as Listeria monocytogenes for understanding the mechanism for actin assembly in vivo . Mechanism for Actin - based Motility at Spots and at the Leading Edge Movement of spots and movement at the cell periphery have many properties in common , including the participa - tion of Arp2 / 3 complex and CP , a requirement for actin polymerization , regulation by Rho family GTPases and the participation of the actin - binding protein , cofilin . We propose that the biochemical mechanisms underlying ex - tension of lamella at the cell periphery and the formation and movement of spots are related . One possible mecha - nism for the actin - based motility observed in spots and at the cell periphery is shown in Fig . 11 . We propose that Arp2 / 3 complex is activated near the Figure 7 . Motile spots in the lamella are small , fin - like pro - jections that taper toward their ends . Cells expressing GFP—CP were grown on elec - tron microscopic grids , placed in a flow chamber on the fluo - rescence microscope to docu - ment the movement of spots and the lamella , and then pre - pared as whole mounts for viewing in the electron micro - scope . Movies of single cells were obtained before and dur - ing fixation for preparing the whole mounts . A shows one frame from the video recording taken using fluorescence mi - croscopy ( left ) during the addition of fixative . Arrowheads , three regions where GFP—CP spots were actively moving just before fixation . The low quality of the fluorescence im - age is due to the decreased signal to noise ratio upon addi - tion of the glutaraldehyde - containing fixation solution . Ad - jacent to the fluorescence view is a stereo pair at low magnification ( right ) of the same cell viewed using electron microscopy ; arrowheads , three structures corresponding to the motile GFP—CP spots . A stereo pair at higher magnifica - tion of the structures marked by arrowheads is shown in B . When viewed with the aid of stereo viewers , the stereo pairs show that the fin - like structures project out from the mem - brane surface . To those observers who view stereo pairs by crossing their eyes , the structures will appear to project away from the viewer . Bars : ( A ) 2 (cid:109) m ; ( B ) 1 . 5 (cid:109) m . Schafer et al . Actin Dynamics in Living Cells 1927 membrane in response to an unidentified signal . The mechanism for the localized activation or recruitment of Arp2 / 3 complex at sites of assembly is unknown , but small G proteins may participate since the distribution of Arp2 / 3 complex was diffuse when Rho family GTPases were in - hibited . Arp2 / 3 complex is a good candidate for initiating actin assembly because it nucleates actin assembly in vitro to create free barbed ends ( 44 ) . Nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by ActA ( 67 ) , the Listeria protein required for actin assembly at the bacterial sur - face . An unknown factor may activate Arp2 / 3 complex similarly to ActA to promote de novo actin assembly at spots and at the leading edge . Actin polymerization would then proceed at the new free barbed ends until blocked by capping protein . The short , newly assembled actin fila - ments would subsequently disassemble via the action of cofilin , which promotes actin filament disassembly ( 7 , 31 , 40 , 50 ) . The formation of stable aggregates of GFP—CP ( this paper ) and actin ( 2 ) in cells expressing LIMK - 1 , which inactivates cofilin , is consistent with the idea that cofilin functions to disassemble actin formed at spots , but a role for cofilin in initiating actin assembly has not been ruled out . At first glance , the presence of both Arp2 / 3 complex , which promotes assembly , together with CP , which limits assembly , at sites of actin assembly at the leading edge may seem paradoxical . However , the actin filaments in an extending lamella or in the cortex are generally short ( 33 , 56 ) , thus , the concomitant appearance of Arp2 / 3 and CP at the leading edge may represent actin nucleation followed by actin assembly and subsequent capping within a region below the level of resolution of the light microscope . In addition , some studies ( 24 , 52 ) , but not all ( 16 ) , suggest that PIP 2 - mediated uncapping of barbed ends at the lead - ing edge is one mechanism for creating free barbed ends to initiate new actin assembly , thus , CP and PIP 2 at the mem - brane , together with Arp2 / 3 complex , may promote actin assembly . Although the mechanism for motility at the periphery and for spot movement may be related , lamellipodia , filopodia , or ruffles do not appear to form via the coales - cence or stabilization of new actin filaments formed at spots . Neither the location nor the direction of moving spots correlated with motility at the cell periphery . Indeed , the loss of spots in migrating cells , together with the con - comitant increase in GFP—Arp3 at the cell periphery , sug - gests that Arp2 / 3 complex and CP are recruited to the cell periphery for actin assembly that drives the lamella for - ward at the expense of motile spots . Regulation of Actin Dynamics The Rho family GTPases regulate the assembly different actin structures ( 22 ) , however , few studies have investi - gated directly the effects of the Rho family GTPases on actin dynamics in vivo . It is likely that the Rho GTPases act cooperatively to regulate actin dynamics in vivo . In our studies using PtK1 cells , rho , rac1 , and cdc42 were in - volved in initiating actin assembly at the cell edge and at sites within the cortical actin network . Rho , rac , and cdc42 may act by recruiting components necessary for actin as - sembly because spots disappeared and GFP—Arp3 became diffuse upon inhibition of these GTPases . In contrast , ac - tin assembly in cell - free extracts was found to require spe - cifically cdc42 ( 35 , 42 , 72 ) . A specific role for rho in actin assembly in cell - free extracts has not consistently been tested in the different cell - free systems . The involvement Figure 8 . Small GTPases regulate spot formation and motility at the cell periphery . GFP—Arp3 fibroblasts were microinjected with plasmids for expression of constitutively active ( v12 ) or dominant - negative forms ( n17 ) of rac1 and cdc42 . Other cells were microinjected with an active form of RhoA ( v14 RhoA ) protein ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) or with C3 toxin ( 160—200 (cid:109) g / ml ) . GFP—Arp3 was diffusely distributed in cells containing N17rac1 , N17cdc42 , or C3 toxin . In contrast , motile spots were observed in cells containing V12rac1 , V12 cdc42 , or V14RhoA . Movies of the complete video sequence for each panel are available at www . cooperlab . wustl . edu or from the authors . Bar , 10 (cid:109) m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 143 , 1998 1928 of multiple G proteins for actin assembly in vivo as de - tected here using GFP - tagged proteins suggests that some components of the system for actin assembly in cells may be lost or inactivated in cell - free extracts . 5 - Phosphoinositides also may regulate the actin dynam - ics observed with GFP—Arp3 and GFP—CP where move - ment of spots through the cytoplasm was stimulated in cells expressing PI 5 - kinase . It is not clear how phospho - inositides promote the movement of spots or regulate actin assembly . Polyphosphoinositides , particularly PI 4 , 5 - P 2 , may promote actin polymerization at membranes by directly stimulating actin nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 complex or by uncapping and preventing capping of actin filament barbed ends ( 25 , 52 ) . The effects of phosphoino - sitides on the actin nucleating activity of Arp2 / 3 complex have not been tested . Alternatively , polyphosphoinosi - tides may promote actin assembly by activating or localizing small G proteins and their guanine nucleotide exchange factors at the membrane , which in turn may recruit nucle - ation factors such as Arp2 / 3 complex . Support for this idea is that RhoGDI , an inhibitor of guanine nucleotide ex - change activity , blocks phosphoinositide - stimulated actin assembly in cell free extracts ( 35 ) . In addition , polyphos - phoinositides possess GEF - like activity ( 71 ) , and could act directly to maintain a sufficient supply of activated small G protein at the membrane . The function of the novel sites of assembly is unknown . The lack of correlation of motile spots with various mark - ers for endocytosis ( Schafer , D . A . , unpublished results ) and the absence of membrane vesicles in the vicinity of the motile spots does not support a role for the transient actin structures in processes that involve movement of compo - nents across the membrane . In addition , spots are not pre - cursors of the extending lamella . An alternate possibility is that the transient actin filament structures formed at spots serve as scaffolding upon which proteins involved in signal transduction are recruited or assembled . We have local - ized CD2AP , a protein having multiple SH3 domains ( 15 ) , with GFP - CP spots ( Schafer , D . A . , unpublished results ) . CD2AP has been implicated as a molecular scaffold re - quired for organization of surface receptors and for polar - izing the cytoskeleton during T cell activation ( 15 ) . At spots and at the cell periphery , CD2AP may bind compo - nents required for actin assembly resulting in localized bursts of actin assembly . On the other hand , the actin cy - toskeleton in living cells may be constitutively poised to assemble actin at the edge of the lamella and at locations within the lamella . In cells like PtK1 fibroblasts that are Figure 10 . Expression of LIMK - 1 , which inactivates cofilin , results in decreased motility of spots and of the cell periphery . Nuclei were injected with DNA for expression of LIMK - 1 ( A ) or a mutant form of LIMK - 1 lacking a portion of the catalytic kinase domain ( B ) and cells were observed 2—3 h after injection . Expression of LIMK - 1 caused spots to stop moving and , in some cases , to the formation of ag - gregates of GFP—CP . In contrast , expression of an inactive mutant form of LIMK - 1 did not affect spot movement or motility at the cell periphery . Numbers indicate elapsed time in seconds .
