However , systematically verifying how the stiﬀness of the tracer ﬁlament or its molecular interactions with the surrounding network impacts the measurement of these parameters has not been possible with the established experimental systems . Here , we use mechanically pro - grammable DNA nanotubes embedded in crosslinked and entangled F - actin networks , as well as in synthetic DNA networks , in order to measure fundamental , structural network properties like tube width and mesh size with respect to the stiﬀness of the tracers . While we conﬁrm some predictions derived from models based purely on steric interactions , our results indicate that these models should be expanded to account for additional inter - ﬁlament interactions , thus describing the behavior of real polymer networks . Both experimental and theoretical polymer physics study how features of the constituting elements deter - mine the properties of whole polymer networks . Previ - ous studies have examined the interaction of semiﬂexible ﬁlaments [ 1 ] or investigated how geometrical parameters [ 2 , 3 ] and bulk mechanical properties [ 4 ] can be deduced from tracking single ﬁlaments embedded in an entangled network . However , complex semiﬂexible polymer net - works such as the cellular cytoskeleton contain multiple types of ﬁlaments with varied mechanical properties as well as crosslinkers which create physical connections be - tween ﬁlaments [ 5 ] . A systematic investigation of the impact from these additional elements upon the dynam - ics of a single ﬁlament moving within the background network has not been possible with the systems typically used for reptation measurements . In our study , we use semiﬂexible DNA nanotubes with tunable stiﬀness [ 6 ] as embedded tracers in crosslinked and entangled F - actin networks and DNA nanotube networks [ 2 ] . Since the DNA ﬁlaments do not speciﬁcally interact with the net - work constituents , we are able to observe single - ﬁlament dynamics and directly measure the tube width of both entangled and crosslinked F - actin , as well as DNA nan - otube networks , with respect to tracer stiﬀness . By ap - plying principles of the tube model [ 7 ] , we determined the mesh size of these polymer networks and conﬁrmed some basic theoretical predictions such as the scaling of mesh size with monomer concentration . Although the concept has been proven to be successful in deriving scal - ing laws that are experimentally accessible [ 8 – 10 ] , we ﬁnd a need for adjustment beyond solely accounting for steric interactions , since the predictions dependent on tracer stiﬀness are not supported by our data . Nonethe - less , our approach allowed us to study the architecture of crosslinked networks , opening new venues to investigate a broad range of ﬁlamentous networks by applying tube model predictions . In this framework , the diﬃculties in describing semiﬂexi - ble polymer networks as a many - body problem are re - duced by studying a single test ﬁlament in the back - ground of all other ﬁlaments [ see Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . These back - ground ﬁlaments constrain the test ﬁlament so that its eﬀective available space is realized by a curved cylindrical tube [ 11 ] , wherein the ﬁlament can reptate , i . e . , diﬀuse along its own contour [ 12 ] . The mesh size ξ of a semi - ﬂexible polymer network is deﬁned as the average dis - tance between two ﬁlaments and , thus , depends on the monomer concentration of the solution , ξ ∝ 1 / c 2 [ 9 , 13 ] . We studied networks usually termed as concentrated so - lutions or tightly - entangled polymer networks , where the diameter a of the reptation tube is assumed to be much smaller than the persistence length l p of the constituting ﬁlaments , a . ξ ≪ l p ≈ L [ 7 , 9 , 14 – 17 ] , with L denoting the contour length of the tracers [ see Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . Con - sidering the relationship of tube width a , mesh size ξ , and persistence length l p , the same scaling law has been obtained by diﬀerent argumentation , a ∝ ξ 6 / 5 l 1 / 5 p [ 7 , 15 , 16 ] . This relation alone is insuﬃcient to measure a network’s mesh size quantitatively by detecting the tube width of embedded tracer ﬁlaments . Hinsch et al . [ 7 ] calculated a prefactor of 0 . 31 in a self - consistent treatment of the net - work by allowing ﬂuctuations of the background ﬁlaments and decomposing the test ﬁlament into independent rods of appropriate length . They also found an additional 2 term referring to boundary eﬀects at the tube ends , using an expression for the free energy of a conﬁned semiﬂexi - ble polymer of ﬁnite length [ 18 ] . This second - order term accounts for the fact that short tracer ﬁlaments are more inﬂuenced by ﬁnite - length eﬀects than long tracers . The complete expression reads [ 7 ] a ≈ 0 . 31 ξ 6 / 5 l 1 / 5 p + 0 . 59 ξ 2 L . ( 1 ) Equation ( 1 ) was originally derived for entangled poly - mer networks , but we were also able to employ it for the determination of the mesh size of crosslinked F - actin networks by using DNA nanotubes as embedded tracer ﬁlaments . These ﬁlaments have no binding sites for explicit actin crosslinking complexes and are thus usable as decoupled , reptating tracers in crosslinked F - actin networks . DNA nanotubes have the additional beneﬁt that their persistence length can be varied suﬃciently to investigate theoretical predictions such as a ∝ l − 0 . 2 p , which were not experimentally accessible before [ 2 ] . DNA nanotubes were hybridized from n partially complementary oligonucleotides , forming n - helix tubes ( n HTs ) [ see Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . Depending on the chosen set of n oligonucleotides , n HTs with diﬀerent diameters and , accordingly , persistence lengths are formed [ 2 , 6 , 19 , 20 ] . Their contour length distribution is comparable to that of actin ﬁlaments , while the ﬁlament width stays below 10 nm [ 6 ] . To hybridize ﬂuorescent tracer ﬁlaments , a ﬂuorescent dye was attached to one of the oligonu - cleotides [ see Fig . 1 ( c ) ] . After hybridization , n HTs are stable for weeks and maintain their structure if they are kept below the structure’s melting temperature of approximately 60 °C [ 6 ] . Subsequently , we were able to polymerize F - actin background networks around the tracer ﬁlaments , ensuring them to be homogeneously distributed . For the crosslinked F - actin background network , we selected the synthetic crosslinker wLX ( weak LifeAct ® - based crosslinker ) introduced by Lorenz et al . [ 21 ] . It consists of two actin - binding LifeAct ® peptides con - nected by double - stranded DNA and transiently links actin ﬁlaments , forming networks that mechanically resemble networks of F - actin and the natural crosslinker α - actinin [ 21 ] . We preferred using wLX over naturally occurring crosslinkers because of its reproducibility , i . e . , deﬁned length and binding strength , and applicability , as the ﬂuorescent n HT tracers showed unspeciﬁc in - teractions with natural crosslinkers such as α - actinin and heavy meromyosin ( data not shown ) that could be avoided by using wLX . The ratio of actin monomers to crosslinker molecules was chosen carefully to 150 : 1 so that the network was fully crosslinked , but not bundled [ 21 ] . In order to compare the reptation of n HTs in F - actin networks to the behavior of n HTs in nanotube networks , Figure 1 . ( a ) Scheme of a tracer ﬁlament of persistence length l p and contour length L , conﬁned to a reptation tube of width a in a network of mesh size ξ . ( b ) Symbolic cross - sections of the n HT tracers with the smallest ( 6HT ) and largest ( 10HT ) circumference used in this study , where each color corresponds to one of the 6 or 10 oligonucleotides ( adapted from [ 2 ] ) . Fil - ament diameters d f and persistence lengths l p of the other tracer ﬁlaments are in between these limits [ 22 ] . ( c ) Mi - croscopy image of a ﬂuorescently labeled 8HT ﬁlament . ( d ) Exemplary overlay of 1000 tracked frames of a reptating 8HT ﬁlament embedded in a crosslinked F - actin network ( actin at 0 . 5 mg / ml with crosslinker wLX ) . The color coding indicates the measurement time ( see color map on the side ) . The ﬁl - ament is neither crosslinked nor constrained to the original reptation tube , but able to explore the surrounding network during the observation time of 100 s . we chose 8HT as the constituting background ﬁlament type since its persistence length of 8 . 9 µm is comparable to that of actin ﬁlaments [ 23 ] . Likewise , we used 8HT as tracer ﬁlaments in F - actin background networks of similar persistence length . The reptation of n HT tracers in diﬀerent background networks was observed using epi - ﬂuorescence microscopy and tracked with the ImageJ plugin JFilament [ 24 ] , see Fig . 1 ( d ) . Details on the hybridization process , sample preparation , measurements , and data processing are given in the Supplemental Material [ 22 ] . By analyzing multiple subsets of 100 frames , we were able to determine a tube width for each individual tracer ﬁlament . After calculating a weighted mean for all tube widths measured with one type of DNA nanotube tracer , 3 Figure 2 . Using DNA nanotube tracers , we were able to ex - amine the dependency of tube width on persistence length for three diﬀerent background networks : entangled F - actin networks ( purple diamonds ) , crosslinked F - actin networks ( crosslinked at a ratio of actin monomers to wLX of 150 : 1 [ 21 ] , blue circles ) and 8HT networks ( green squares ) . Tube width error bars are weighted standard errors obtained by calculating weighted averages of several individual tracer ﬁl - aments . The tracers were 6HT , 7HT , 8HT , 9HT and 10HT , with a persistence length range from approximately 3 µm to 13 µm [ 2 , 22 ] . Matching colored lines depict the power laws re - sulting from ﬁtting the leading term of Eq . ( 1 ) . The dashed line indicates the theoretical scaling derived from the tube model . we carried out an error - weighted ﬁt to determine the power law exponents of the tube width scaling with the tracers’ persistence length . Figure 2 shows the measured tube width values for ﬁve types of n HT ﬁlaments with persistence lengths ranging from approximately 3 µm to 13 µm in three distinct background networks . In general , one would expect to observe diﬀerent tube widths for entangled and for crosslinked background networks of the same concentration since some ﬂuctua - tion modes of the background polymers are suppressed in crosslinked networks [ 25 ] . However , we observe nearly the same values for tube widths in entangled and crosslinked F - actin networks , indicating that the crosslinker wLX does not change the network geometry for the chosen ratio of actin monomers to crosslinker molecules [ 21 ] . In 8HT networks , n HTs were less motile than in F - actin networks and appeared nearly stuck , resulting in lower tube widths . The predicted scaling a ∝ l − 0 . 2 p ( indicated by the dashed line in Fig . 2 ) could not be conﬁrmed in all of the three background networks . It is only observed for n HTs in entangled F - actin where the exponent is − 0 . 33 ± 0 . 16 so that an exponent of − 0 . 2 is within the error limits . The power law exponent for crosslinked F - actin is − 0 . 42 ± 0 . 08 . However , since the tube width values have relatively large errors , it cannot be concluded that Figure 3 . Mesh size vs . monomer concentration for F - actin networks crosslinked with wLX . Error bars are calculated from relative error propagation and weighted averaging over several individual tracers [ 22 ] . The expected scaling ξ ∝ c − 0 . 5 [ 9 , 13 ] is indicated by the dashed line . the predicted scaling does not apply in this case . The scaling exponent for 8HT as a background network is − 0 . 74 ± 0 . 12 which diﬀers from the predicted exponent by a factor of at least 3 . Together with the observed lower motility of n HTs in 8HT background , this implies unspeciﬁc interactions between the ﬁlaments that are not captured by the tube model . By ﬁtting the leading term of Eq . ( 1 ) , we were also able to derive the mesh size of the background networks . The estimated mesh sizes are 1 µm for entangled F - actin , 1 . 2 µm for crosslinked F - actin and 1 . 4 µm for 8HT networks , corresponding well with previous publications [ 2 , 26 ] . With our DNA nanotube tracers , we were able to mea - sure the mesh size of crosslinked F - actin networks . This is not possible using actin - based tracer ﬁlaments because they do not reptate in the presence of actin crosslinkers . 8HTs were again chosen for their persistence length comparability to unstabilized actin ﬁlaments [ 23 ] , avoid - ing eﬀects stemming from diﬀerent polymer stiﬀnesses . By measuring the tube width of embedded 8HTs and employing Eq . ( 1 ) with the adjusted scaling of a ∝ l − 0 . 42 p obtained from the ﬁt plotted in Fig . 2 , we determined the mesh size for crosslinked F - actin networks of four diﬀerent concentrations ( see Fig . 3 ) . The expected scaling ξ ∝ c − 0 . 5 [ 9 , 13 ] was conﬁrmed as it has already been for entangled F - actin [ 2 , 27 ] . The resulting mesh size of 1 . 0 ± 0 . 2 µm for a concentration of 0 . 5 mg / ml is comparable to the ﬁtted mesh size of crosslinked F - actin networks from Fig . 2 and to already published values for entangled F - actin of the same concentration [ 2 , 26 ] , implying that crosslinking does not change the geometry of the F - actin network . Since ﬁlaments with a shorter contour length L are more aﬀected by boundary eﬀects at the end of the tube , we examined whether the scaling of the second - order term a ∝ L − 1 of Eq . ( 1 ) applies to our data . We chose to study this aspect by measuring tube widths and contour lengths of embedded 8HTs in crosslinked F - actin background networks at various concentrations . 4 Figure 4 . ( a ) Individual tube widths for 8HTs in crosslinked F - actin background networks versus tracer contour lengths . The color coding refers to the networks’ actin monomer con - centration . The predicted scaling a ∝ L − 1 is indicated by the dashed line . Error bars are standard errors [ 22 ] . ( b ) This plot shows the relative correction ( 0 . 59 ξ 2 L ) 1 a versus mesh size ( circles , calculated by a ∝ 0 . 31 ξ 6 / 5 l 0 . 42 p + 0 . 59 ξ 2 L ) for the data of panel ( a ) . The numbers accompanying each data point are the ﬁlaments’ rounded contour lengths . Predictive curves of relative corrections are plotted for theoretical contour lengths of 5 µm , 10 µm and 20 µm . In Fig . 4 ( a ) , all resulting individual tube widths for 8HTs are plotted over the tracers’ contour lengths . The predicted scaling a ∝ L − 1 ( indicated by the dashed line ) is not fulﬁlled for any of the background network concentrations . However , the fact that we do not observe it does not mean that the ﬁlaments are not aﬀected by the predicted boundary eﬀects . The leading term of Eq . ( 1 ) , by itself , is valid for inﬁnite tracer ﬁlaments ; the second term originates from considering the free energy of ﬁnite tracer ﬁlaments constrained by the surrounding network and corrects for polydisperse tracers [ 7 ] . To quantify the eﬀect of such ﬁnite tracer lengths , we computed the relative correction of the tube width stemming from the second term of Eq . ( 1 ) . The results plotted in Fig . 4 ( b ) reveal that the relative correction is indeed higher for shorter ﬁlaments . Figure 4 ( b ) also includes calculated curves of relative corrections for distinct contour lengths analogous to predictions from Hinsch et al . [ 7 ] . The data points match these predictions well , illustrating that longer ﬁlaments are less aﬀected by boundary aﬀects at the end of the tube . However , the observed eﬀect of these relative corrections of tube widths is not reﬂected in the variation of the absolute values of tube widths , probably because local inhomogeneities aﬀecting each individual tracer’s observed tube width have a higher inﬂuence than the ﬁnite - length eﬀect . Figure 4 shows the tube widths and corrections for crosslinked F - actin networks under the condition that the tracer persistence length equals that of the background network ﬁlaments . Repeating this analysis lead to the same conclusion for all other sets of tube width data from n HT tracers embedded in three diﬀerent background networks [ 22 ] . Although we expected to see a diﬀerence between the tube widths of entangled and crosslinked F - actin net - works at the same concentration due to the suppression of ﬂuctuation modes of crosslinked background ﬁlaments , the average values were comparable within the error bars , indicating that the ﬂuctuations of background ﬁlaments do not have a high impact on the constraining potential exerted on the tracer ﬁlament [ 3 , 28 ] . By varying the persistence length l p of the tracers , we found that the expected scaling relation a ∝ l − 0 . 2 p is not valid for all of the three examined background networks . 8HT background networks show a diﬀerent relation between tube width and persistence length , presumably due to interactions between the n HT tracers and the 8HT net - work that are not accounted for in the general reptation model , e . g . , electrostatic interactions between the DNA molecules that lead to an eﬀective stickiness [ 29 ] . Recent studies have shown that other scaling predictions made from the tube model are not applicable to networks of n HTs [ 2 ] and that sticky interactions lead to altered bulk properties of semiﬂexible polymer networks [ 30 ] . We speculate that an experimental adjustment of the exponent in the relation a ∝ l − 0 . 2 p is acceptable when the interactions not included in the tube model only mildly aﬀect the tracers’ reptation . Previous publications examining reptation have made use of F - actin tracers in entangled F - actin [ 1 , 31 ] . Stiﬀ ﬁlaments [ 32 ] and ﬂexible tracers [ 3 , 4 ] have also been measured . There is no experimental study that tests the predicted scaling a ∝ l − 0 . 2 p for semiﬂexible ﬁlaments over a broad range of l p . A recent attempt by Keshavarz et al . [ 3 ] utilized ﬂexible ﬁlaments with diﬀerent persistence lengths , but was limited to two data points , hindering a clear veriﬁcation of a scaling law . However , the same study proved the prediction a ∝ ξ 6 / 5 for ﬂexible ﬁlaments where ξ can be calculated independently of a from the elastic plateau modulus obtained by rheological measurements [ 3 ] . In turn , we were able to measure the mesh size of crosslinked F - actin networks by applying Eq . ( 1 ) . Until now , this 5 had only been done before for entangled F - actin by employing actin ﬁlaments as tracers [ 2 , 26 ] . The results for crosslinked F - actin networks reveal a good agreement with the established concentration scaling ξ ∝ c − 0 . 5 [ 2 , 27 ] and the absolute values are well comparable to those published for entangled F - actin networks [ 2 , 26 ] , conﬁrming that the crosslinker wLX does not change the network architecture for the chosen crosslinker concentration [ 21 ] . The correspondence of measured mesh size values between entangled and crosslinked F - actin networks justiﬁes the use of Eq . ( 1 ) for the crosslinked networks , even if it was originally derived for an entangled back - ground network with ﬂuctuating background ﬁlaments . This is comparable to the ﬁndings of Gardel et al . [ 33 ] , where the elastic modulus of a crosslinked F - actin network followed the concentration scaling that had been deduced for an entangled network in the tube model framework previously [ 8 ] . We would like to point out that the use of other actin crosslinkers might change the network architecture or the interactions between background network and tracer ﬁlaments in such a way that it is not possible to use Eq . ( 1 ) for data evaluation . A recent simulation study investigated the diﬀerence between static and entangled background polymers and its eﬀect on stress relaxation in the framework of the tube model [ 34 ] . Lang and Frey [ 34 ] showed that constraint release , the dissolution of the reptation tube upon correlated motion of the tracer and its surrounding ﬁlaments , leads to altered tracer dynamics and relaxation times [ 4 , 9 , 34 ] . This could explain why the conventional tube model predictions do not fully account for the examined networks , which diﬀer from a structure with ﬁxed obstacles . In conclusion , we have tested the persistence length dependency of tracer ﬁlaments reptating in a background network , revealing that the tube model needs to be extended to describe actual experimental data , where more than steric interactions are present . However , the tube model does indeed provide valid predictions for measuring parameters describing the geometrical structure . Utilizing mechanically tunable ﬁlaments as tracers , not only entangled , but also crosslinked networks can be architecturally characterized . This approach is particularly appealing because it avoids additional inﬂuences inherent to embedding ﬂuorescent beads for these determinations [ 27 , 35 ] or labeling the entire network with ﬂuorophores [ 36 ] . Our method may also prove applicable to other semiﬂexible polymer networks , e . g . , networks of other cytoskeletal ﬁlaments or collagen ﬁbers that have been physically crosslinked . The programmability of DNA nanotubes further allows one to choose a suitable tracer’s persistence length to match that of the background network of interest , thus mitigating emergent eﬀects due to diﬀerent polymer stiﬀnesses . Furthermore , stable and biocompatible probe ﬁlaments like DNA nanotubes may be utilized to measure local properties of heterogeneous scaﬀolds such as the extracellular matrix or the cellular cytoskeleton .

Oligonucleotide concentration was determined us - ing a NanoDrop 1000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc . , USA ) . Final DNA n HT samples consisted of the n − 1 strands U 1 − U n − 1 and one T n strand , each at the same monomer concentration . Final buﬀer conditions for hy - bridization were 1xTE ( 10 mM Tris , 1 mM EDTA , pH 8 ) and 12 . 5 mM MgCl 2 . A thermocycler ( TProfessional Standard PCR Thermocycler , Core Life Sciences Inc . , USA ) was used to hybridize the n HTs . The hybridization protocol included randomization and dehybridization for 10 min at 90°C followed by complementary base pairing in 20 temperature steps of − 0 . 5°C for 60 min each , start - ing from 65 °C and a quick drop to 20 °C . Hybridized n HTs were stored for up to 4 weeks at room tempera - ture without detectable degradation . For ﬂuorescently labeled n HTs as tracer ﬁlaments , U 1 was substituted by the modiﬁed U 1 - Cy3 , with the dye Cy3 attached to the regular U 1 strand . Actin G - actin was prepared from rabbit muscle as described previously [ S3 ] . Actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of 10 times concentrated F - Buﬀer ( 1 M KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM ATP , 10 mM DTT , 20 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 5 ) . Crosslinker wLX The crosslinker wLX was synthesized as described by Lorenz et al . [ S4 ] . In short , two actin - binding domains ( LifeAct ® , Peptide Specialty Laboratories GmbH , Ger - many ) were covalently attached to the ends of double - stranded DNA ( sequences given in [ S4 ] ) using a copper - free click - chemistry approach . Since the two LifeAct ® peptides were connected via double - stranded DNA , the composition physically crosslinked actin ﬁlaments . Sample preparation and measurement Pre - hybridized n HTs labeled with the dye Cy3 were diluted gradually to 10 nM . From this dilution , a small fraction was gently mixed with a pre - hybridized unla - beled 8HT network to a ﬁnal ratio of 1 : 4000 of labeled to unlabeled ﬁlaments . Subsequently the sample solution was placed between two glass slides previously coated with Sigmacote ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and sealed with grease and nail polish . 8HT network samples were equi - librated overnight at 4 °C and measured at 8 µM . For the actin samples , Cy3 - labeled nanotubes were mixed with monomeric unlabeled actin ( and additionally with the crosslinker wLX to a molar ratio of 150 actin monomers to 1 crosslinker molecule for the crosslinked actin networks ) to an end ratio of nanotubes to actin ﬁl - aments of at least 1 : 6000 . Actin assembly was triggered by addition of 10x F - Buﬀer and actin ﬁlaments were al - lowed to polymerize for 1 h to 2 h , ensuring that the actin network formed around the embedded tracer ﬁlaments . The samples were then placed between two glass slides previously passivated with 5 % bovine serum albumin or Sigmacote ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , sealed with grease and left to settle for 30 min to 60min prior to measurement . Entangled actin networks were polymerized at 0 . 5 mg / ml and crosslinked networks at 0 . 3 mg / ml to 0 . 9 mg / ml . After the equilibration time , images of labeled reptating n HT tubes were recorded via an epi - ﬂuorescence micro - scope ( Leica DM - IRB , 100x objective , NA 1 . 35 ) with an attached CCD camera ( Andor , iXon DV887 ) at a frame rate of 10 Hz . Tubewidth analysis After preprocessing the image stacks with the ImageJ plugin Stack Contrast Adjustment [ S5 ] , ﬁlament back - bones were determined by the ImageJ plugin JFilament [ S6 ] . From the backbones , tube widths were derived us - ing a self - written Matlab ( The MathWorks , Inc . ) script 2 Figure S1 . Scheme of tube width determination , example ﬁlament is an 8HT in F - actin at 0 . 5 mg / ml crosslinked with wLX at a ratio of 150 : 1 . The process is explained in detail in the text . 3 as depicted by Fig . S1 . The process is as follows : Panel S1 ( a ) plots all 1000 tracked conﬁgurations of the ﬁla - ment during the observation time of 100 s ( see color bar at side ) . From these 1000 frames , three sets of 100 con - secutive frames are chosen so that the ﬁlament stays in one reptation tube for the selected 10 s . As a criterion , the deviation of the ﬁlament’s midpoint from the refer - ence midpoint of the ﬁrst frame is examined as displayed in panel S1 ( c ) . Subﬁgure S1 ( b ) shows an example of one chosen set of 100 tracked conﬁgurations ( blue ) . The grey dotted line depicts the mean of all 100 conﬁgurations and the red lines are perpendicular to this tube backbone . To determine the tube width , the intersection points of the 100 individual conﬁgurations with the orthogonal lines are detected . The resulting intersection positions ( or - ange crosses ) are processed for each tube backbone point as shown in panel S1 ( d ) : From the intersection positions , a kernel density distribution is calculated ( red ) . A Gaus - sian distribution ( blue ) is ﬁtted to this kernel density esti - mate . Since this process is repeated for every orthogonal line from panel S1 ( b ) , we can plot a tube width measure for each point of the tube backbone as in subﬁgure S1 ( e ) . The orange curve shows the distance of the two outer - most individual conﬁgurations , whereas the blue line is the standard deviation of the Gaussian ﬁt from panel S1 ( d ) . Due to a rather high ﬂuctuation of the ﬁlament’s ends , only the middle part of the curve in panel S1 ( e ) is used ( i . e . , tube arc length from 1 µm to 5 . 6 µm for this example ) and the resulting tube width of the chosen set is the average of two times the standard deviation of the Gaussian ﬁt . The tube width of the whole ﬁlament is deﬁned as the average of the tube width from the three subsets of conﬁgurations , the standard error of the tube width u ( a ) is the standard error of this mean . To implic - itly calculate the mesh size from a ≈ 0 . 31 ξ 6 / 5 l 1 / 5 p + 0 . 59 ξ 2 L , ( S1 ) the contour length of the ﬁlament was deduced as the average contour length of the three hundred frames used for tube width determination . Analogously to the tube width , the standard error u ( L ) of the contour length is the standard error of this mean . For the mesh size , we calculated the error u ( ξ ) by relative error propagation using u ( ξ ) = u ( l p ) ǫ 5 / 6 + u ( a ) 5 / 6 + u ( L ) / 2 , with u ( l p ) being the standard error of the persistence length accord - ing to Table S1 . The factor ǫ is the exponent extracted from the ﬁt displayed in Fig . 2 in the main text , i . e . , ǫ = 0 . 33 for entangled F - actin , ǫ = 0 . 42 for crosslinked F - actin and ǫ = 0 . 74 for the 8HT background network . CHARACTERISTIC LENGTHS OF DNA NANOTUBE TRACERS In Table S1 , we give an overview of the n HT persis - tence lengths l p and ﬁlament diameters d f used through - out our calculations . Filament diameters were estimated from n HT circumference values given in Ref . [ S2 ] . Persis - tence length values were taken from Ref . [ S1 ] , except for 7HT , where we measured the persistence length with the method described in [ S1 ] . Since the persistence length of actin ﬁlaments is about 9 µm [ S7 ] , approximate ratios between tracer ( 6HT , 7HT , 8HT , 9HT , and 10HT ) and background ﬁlament ( F - actin or 8HT ) persistence lengths are 3x , 1 . 5x , 1x , 1x , and ( 1 / 1 . 5 ) x , respectively . tracer l p [ µm ] d f [ nm ] 6HT 3 . 18 ± 0 . 25 5 . 7 7HT 5 . 64 ± 0 . 76 6 . 7 8HT 8 . 94 ± 0 . 87 7 . 6 9HT 9 . 66 ± 1 . 57 8 . 6 10HT 12 . 75 ± 1 . 23 9 . 5 Table S1 . Characteristic lengths of the tracer ﬁlaments [ S1 , S2 ] , l p is the persistence length and d f is the tracer thickness . CONTOUR LENGTH CORRECTION OF TUBE WIDTH We used Eq . ( S1 ) to calculate mesh sizes from mea - sured tube widths . The second term accounts for bound - ary eﬀects occuring at the end of the reptation tube . In the main text , we showed that the scaling a ∝ L − 1 is not observed for 8HT tracers embedded in F - actin networks crosslinked with wLx at diﬀerent concentrations [ see Fig . 4 ( a ) ] . In Fig . S2 , we plot individual tube widths vs . contour lengths of ﬁve n HT tracer types in three diﬀer - ent background networks with constant concentrations . The results do not correspond to the predicted scaling a ∝ L − 1 as shown before , again conﬁrming that the vari - ation of the absolute values of tube width due to ﬁnite length eﬀects is negligible . By calculating the relative correction of the tube width stemming from ﬁnite length eﬀects , we are able to verify that these eﬀects are small , but larger for shorter tracer ﬁlaments [ see Fig . 4 ( b ) in main text ] . Here we show that the same results are ob - tained for all measured combinations of tracer ﬁlaments and background networks . In Fig . S3 , the relative cor - rection ( 0 . 59 ξ 2 L ) 1 a is plotted against the mesh size deter - mined by a ∝ 0 . 31 ξ 6 / 5 l ǫ p + 0 . 59 ξ 2 L with an exponent ǫ = 0 . 33 for entangled F - actin , ǫ = 0 . 42 for crosslinked F - actin and ǫ = 0 . 74 for the 8HT network , as extracted from the ﬁt displayed in Fig . 2 in the main text . 4 5 10 15 20 25 contour length [ µm ] 0 . 05 0 . 15 0 . 25 0 . 35 0 . 45 0 . 55 t ube w i d t h [ µ m ] 6HT in F - actin 6HT in F - actin + wLx 6HT in 8HT 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 contour length [ µm ] 0 . 05 0 . 15 0 . 25 0 . 35 0 . 45 0 . 55 t ube w i d t h [ µ m ] 7HT in F - actin 7HT in F - actin + wLx 7HT in 8HT 5 10 15 20 25 contour length [ µm ] 0 . 05 0 . 15 0 . 25 0 . 35 0 . 45 0 . 55 t ube w i d t h [ µ m ] 8HT in F - actin 8HT in F - actin + wLx 8HT in 8HT 5 10 15 20 25 contour length [ µm ] 0 . 05 0 . 15 0 . 25 0 . 35 0 . 45 0 . 55 t ube w i d t h [ µ m ] 9HT in F - actin 9HT in F - actin + wLx 9HT in 8HT 5 10 15 20 25 contour length [ µm ] 0 . 05 0 . 15 0 . 25 0 . 35 0 . 45 0 . 55 t ube w i d t h [ µ m ] 10HT in F - actin 10HT in F - actin + wLx 10HT in 8HT ( a ) ( c ) ( e ) ( d ) ( b ) Figure S2 .
