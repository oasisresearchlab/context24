Nonetheless , little is known about the cognitive mechanisms underlying children’s development of the capacity to engage in these complex forms of reasoning . We used longitudinal data to suggest an integrated resolution to debates about the factors underlying children’s acquisition of analogical thinking , one type of complex reasoning . Analogical reasoning is a core part of human innovation ( Markman & Wood , 2009 ) , creativity ( Dunbar , 1997 ; Sternberg , 1988 ) , and adaptive general intelligence ( Cattell , 1971 ; Gentner , 2010 ) . It is defined as the ability to draw relationships between dispa - rate or dissimilar phenomena ( Gentner , 1983 ) . Thinking rela - tionally is fundamental to analytical and inductive reasoning and may distinguish human thought from the thinking of humanity’s closest animal relatives ( Gentner , 2010 ; Penn , Holyoak , & Povinelli , 2008 ) . In the research reported here , we examined the specific contribution of early executive function to the development of analogical - reasoning skills , while taking into account pro - posed alternative mechanisms to the extent possible . Cross - sectional experimentation provides strong evidence that executive function plays a role in analogy development ( Rich - land , Morrison , & Holyoak , 2006 ; Thibaut , French , & Vez - neva , 2010 ) . Executive function , also known as cognitive control , is generally defined as the ability to control cognitive actions . This includes both inhibiting impulsive task respond - ing and manipulating and organizing complex information while holding it active in working memory . Executive func - tion thus allows such complex skills as planning , monitoring , task switching , and controlling attention ( Diamond , 2002 ; Stuss , 2007 ) . Inhibitory control and additional working memory aspects of executive function have been posited to explain analogical - reasoning capacity in children ( Richland et al . , 2006 ; Thibaut et al . , 2010 ) and adults ( Krawczyk et al . , 2008 ) . Neurological studies of analogy tasks have shown involvement of regions of the frontal lobe attributed to executive function ( Bunge , Wendelken , Badre , & Wagner , 2005 ; Krawczyk et al . , 2008 ) . Executive function further predicts some aspects of school achievement ( e . g . , Bull , Espy , & Wiebe , 2008 ) and fluid intel - ligence ( see J . Duncan , 2005 ) . Executive function is also inte - gral to the arc of reasoning skill across the life span , increasing with age in childhood and decreasing into old age , particularly from age 55 and above ( Nettelbeck & Burns , 2009 ) . Several alternative theories of analogical - reasoning devel - opment have been proposed . Halford and colleagues ( e . g . , see Corresponding Author : Lindsey E .

Burchinal 2 1 Department of Comparative Human Development , University of Chicago , and 2 Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill Abstract Analogical reasoning is a core cognitive skill that distinguishes humans from all other species and contributes to general fluid intelligence , creativity , and adaptive learning capacities . Yet its origins are not well understood . In the study reported here , we analyzed large - scale longitudinal data from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to test predictors of growth in analogical - reasoning skill from third grade to adolescence . Our results suggest an integrative resolution to the theoretical debate regarding contributory factors arising from smaller - scale , cross - sectional experiments on analogy development . Children with greater executive - function skills ( both composite and inhibitory control ) and vocabulary knowledge in early elementary school displayed higher scores on a verbal analogies task at age 15 years , even after adjusting for key covariates . We posit that knowledge is a prerequisite to analogy performance , but strong executive - functioning resources during early childhood are related to long - term gains in fundamental reasoning skills . Keywords cognitive development , reasoning Received 1 / 17 / 12 ; Revision accepted 5 / 14 / 12 Research Report 88 Richland , Burchinal Andrews & Halford , 2002 ) instead posit the relational - com - plexity theory , hypothesizing that the level of maturation in children’s short - term and working memory may explain the number of relations that children can handle when thinking analogically—thus , younger children have more limited resources with which to complete a complex analogy . In our analysis of analogy development , we included short - term memory as a predictor to distinguish the role of higher - level executive - function processes ( cognitive and inhibitory control in working memory ) from the role of storage - capacity limits ( short - term memory ) . Other theories emphasize the role of knowledge acquisi - tion . Goswami ( 1992 ) proposed the relational - primacy theory , which describes analogical reasoning as available to children from birth but limited by their knowledge . Gentner and Rattermann ( 1991 ) chart the trajectory of analogy develop - ment through relational - shift theory , hypothesizing that chil - dren will reason nonanalogically about representations before acquiring relevant background knowledge , connecting entities on the basis of appearance - based similarities . Then , following relevant knowledge acquisition , children will shift to analogi - cal reasoning . These two theories propose different trajecto - ries of analogy production but concur that base knowledge dictates a child’s capacity . In the current study , a vocabulary assessment was used as a measure of children’s base level of knowledge because analogical reasoning is closely tied to knowledge through language skills ( see Gentner , 2010 ) . We have argued previously that these theories should not be considered mutually exclusive but rather may be operating concurrently ( Morrison , Doumas , & Richland , 2011 ; Richland et al . , 2006 ) . However , in the current analysis , we were for the first time able to evaluate the long - term impact of one devel - opmental mechanism , executive function , in the context of other proposed mechanisms , short - term memory - capacity limits and base knowledge . Specifically , we examined the long - term impact of early executive - function skills , both as a composite and specifically as inhibitory control , on the development of analogical reasoning from young childhood to adolescence . Reasoning in adolescence is particularly important because this is when youth encounter their most complex learning opportunities at school ( e . g . , Richland , Zur , & Holyoak , 2007 ) , take college preparatory exams , and make important life - course decisions . Method Participants The sample included 1 , 364 children ( 48 % female , 52 % male ) participating in the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development ( SECCYD ) , of whom 539 had complete data on all variables used in the analysis . Multiple imputations were used to impute data for the missing variables for the remaining sample . The sample was diverse in terms of socioeconomic sta - tus ( 11 % poor , i . e . , income / poverty threshold < 1 . 5 ; 26 % low or middle income , i . e . , 1 . 5 < income / poverty threshold < 3 ; 63 % middle or high income , i . e . , income / poverty threshold > 3 ) , ethnicity ( 76 % White , 13 % Black , 6 % Hispanic , 5 % other ) , and maternal education ( 18 % had a high school diploma or less , 35 % had some college , 26 % had a bachelor’s degree , and 15 % had a graduate degree ) . Procedure A select subset of the SECCYD measures were included in the current analysis . These assessments are described in more detail on the SECCYD Web site ( http : / / secc . rti . org ) . Analytical reasoning . Reasoning skill was examined as a dependent measure using the Verbal Analogies subtest ( VA ) of the Woodcock - Johnson Psycho - Educational Battery – Revised ( WJ - R ; Woodcock & Johnson , 1990 ) at third grade and at age 15 years . Analogies on the WJ - R VA were presented orally at third grade and in written form at age 15 years , in the tradi - tional form of “a is to b as c is to d” ( e . g . , “dog is to puppy as cat is to _ _ _ ? ” ) . The child is shown pictures of objects and required to select the object that best completes the analogy . As a language - based , formal - analogy task , versus a nonverbal or problem - solving task , this measure relies on a combination of reasoning skill and vocabulary . The inclusion of a vocabu - lary measure as a predictor was therefore essential to evaluat - ing the distinct role of executive function . Executive function . Two measures of executive function were used . General executive - function capacity was assessed using the Tower of Hanoi ( TOH ) task ( as adapted from Borys , Spitz , & Dorans , 1982 ) at first grade . This task requires the integra - tion of component executive - function skills : inhibitory control , goal shifting , and manipulating information held in a mental set ( Bull , Espy , & Senn , 2004 ; Miyake et al . , 2000 ) . The task required children to move a configuration of objects from one peg to another without violating constraining rules ; a compos - ite efficiency score was calculated based on performance over six trials . The second task , the Children’s Stroop , administered at age 54 months , focused on inhibitory control—the execu - tive - function ability to monitor and control automatic responses to stimuli . Children were shown cards of day or night pictures and were instructed to respond “day” to the night pictures and vice versa ( Gerstadt , Hong , & Diamond , 1994 ) . Vocabulary knowledge . A vocabulary score at age 54 months was included as a measure of acquired verbal knowledge that might serve as a prerequisite to analogical reasoning ( Gentner & Rattermann , 1991 ; Goswami , 1992 ) . Standard scores on the WJ - R Picture Vocabulary subtest ( WJ - R PV ; Woodcock & Johnson , 1990 ) measured children’s ability to recognize or name picture objects . Short - term memory . The standard score on the WJ - R Mem - ory for Sentences subtest ( WJ - R MS ; Woodcock & Johnson , 1990 ) measured children’s ability at age 54 months to remem - ber and repeat simple words , phrases , and sentences presented Reasoning Development 89 verbally . A short - term memory measure allowed us to distin - guish between the contributions of simple storage capacity and active manipulation in executive function . Sustained attention . The Continuous Performance Test ( CPT ; Rosvold , Mirsky , Sarason , Bransome , & Beck , 1956 ) was administered at age 54 months as a measure of children’s vigilance and ability to sustain attention on a task . The CPT has been used to assess attention disorders that could involve executive - function processes . However , component analyses suggest that it is most directly a test of vigilance and ability to sustain attention , rather than a test of cognitive flexibility or control ( Mirsky , Anthony , Duncan , Ahearn , & Kellam , 1991 ) . Thus , in this study , the CPT was used as a covariate to distin - guish between the effects of vigilance and executive function . Demographic family characteristics . Data were collected on family background via interviews conducted with mothers . The recruitment site was considered families’ geographical location . Mothers reported the child’s ethnicity ( coded as white , black , Hispanic , or other ) , child’s gender , the mother’s years of education , family income , and household size . Socio - economic status was calculated as an income - to - needs ratio by dividing total family income by the relevant poverty line for family income established by the U . S . Office of Management and Budget . Data analysis Analyses of covariance ( ANCOVA ) predicted analogical rea - soning at age 15 years from early executive - function , vocabu - lary , memory , and attention skills , adjusting for analogical reasoning in third grade and family characteristics . In other words , this analysis tested the extent to which residualized increases in analogical - reasoning scores on the WJ - R from age 10 to age 15 years varied as a function of selected early school - age skills . All measures were included as predictors . The scores on the Children’s Stroop , CPT , and TOH were skewed toward zero , and a square - root transformation was applied to reduce the skew . The covariates included the child’s WJ - R analogical - reasoning score in third grade and the child’s gen - der , mother’s education , family income , child’s ethnicity , and recruitment site . Effect sizes were computed by multiplying the unstandardized coefficient yielded in the analysis by the standard deviation on the predictor and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the outcome ( National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Early Child Care Research Network & Duncan , 2003 ) . The inclusion of the child’s analogical - reasoning skills in third grade as a covariate allowed us to test the extent to which skills in the other measured areas at entry to school contrib - uted to predicting the variability in the youth’s analogical - rea - soning skills at age 15 years that was not related to his or her skills at age 10 years . The inclusion of analogy skill at third grade as a covariate made the analysis of the other predictors relatively conservative because analogy skill was measured at a later age . Therefore , observed associations reflect the extent to which early childhood skills predict gains over time beyond their ability to predict the child’s skill level in third grade . Not surprisingly , there were missing data in the 15 - year longitudinal study . Multiple imputations were conducted to estimate missing data in a manner that approximated both the value of a missing variable for that individual from all other data and the degree of variability in the variable ( Widaman , 2006 ) . Fifteen data sets were imputed from all of the variables in the analysis plus measures of family income and parenting during early and middle childhood . The efficiency in imputing all analysis variables exceeded . 90 . Each of the imputed data sets was analyzed using ANCOVAs , and the parameters and their standard errors were combined to reflect variability within and between data sets . Results Descriptive statistics for the entire sample are shown in Table 1 , and correlations among all analyzed variables are pre - sented in Table 2 . Verbal Analogies scores at 15 years of age were moderately to highly correlated with the selected family covariates and earlier vocabulary , attention , memory , and executive - function measures . Most of these measures of the child’s skills were modestly correlated , with somewhat higher correlations among the various subtests of the WJ - R . Regression analyses provided a relatively stringent test of the contribution of executive function , vocabulary , memory , and attention skills to the development of analogical - reason - ing skills between the ages of 10 and 15 years ( Table 3 ) . An ANCOVA indicated that most of the selected covariates— earlier Verbal Analogies score , maternal education , location : F ( 9 , 1342 ) = 2 . 91 , p < . 001 , and ethnicity : F ( 3 , 1342 ) = 9 . 30 , p < . 001—were significantly related to verbal - analogy skills at age 15 years . Child gender ( p = . 11 ) and family income ( p = . 77 ) were not . Adjusting for these covariates and all other ear - lier child skills in the model , we found that verbal - analogy skills at age 15 were independently predicted from the execu - tive - function skills in first grade ( as measured by the TOH task : p < . 012 ) and inhibitory - control skills at entry to school ( as measured by the Children’s Stroop : p < . 023 ) as well as vocabulary ( p < . 001 ) . The child’s short - term memory ( p = . 41 ) and skills at sustaining attention ( p = . 07 ) were not reli - ably related to verbal - analogy skills at age 15 years . 1 The mag - nitude of the associations tended to be small but reliable , as illustrated in Figure 1 , which shows the predicted score for children who scored 1 standard deviation below the mean , at the mean , and 1 standard deviation above the mean on mea - sures of vocabulary skills at 54 months , inhibitory control at 54 months , and executive function at the first grade . To evaluate the concern that executive function and vocabu - lary would successfully predict a wide range of outcome mea - sures , we ran the same model again twice , predicting outcomes that were not theorized to require these executive functions of 90 Richland , Burchinal Table 1 .

We ran the model first with reading comprehension as an alternative achievement outcome and second with externalizing behavior as an alternative behavioral outcome . Although both academic and externalizing behaviors have been shown to be related to behavioral control over sustaining attention to task as measured by the CPT ( G . J . Duncan et al . , 2007 ) , this construct is distinct from executive function as defined here ( i . e . , response inhibi - tion and the ability to manipulate information in working mem - ory ; see Diamond , 2002 ; Miyake et al . , 2000 ; Stuss , 2007 ) . In these additional analyses , neither executive - function variable predicted reading ( Children’s Stroop : β = −0 . 02 , SE = 0 . 04 , p = . 54 ; TOH : β = 0 . 04 , SE = 0 . 03 , p = . 14 ) or behavior problems ( Children’s Stroop : β = 0 . 02 , SE = 0 . 02 , p = . 40 ; TOH : β = −0 . 03 , SE = 0 . 04 , p = . 51 ) . In contrast , reading was predicted by vocabulary scores ( β = 0 . 48 , SE = 0 . 03 , p < . 001 ) and short - term memory ( β = 0 . 08 , SE = 0 . 03 , p = . 017 ) , and externalizing behavior was predicted by sustained attention ( β = 0 . 07 , SE = 0 . 04 , p = . 04 ) Discussion Overall , these results indicate that both inhibitory control and composite executive - function skills make independent , specialized contributions to children’s analytical - reasoning development beyond the contributions of key cognitive and environmental covariates , as we hypothesized from cross - sectional and simulation data ( Morrison et al . , 2011 ; Richland et al . , 2006 ) . The significant relationship between early vocab - ulary and later reasoning skill additionally supports theoretical Reasoning Development 91 proposals that language and knowledge are necessary underpin - nings for verbal analogical reasoning ( Gentner & Rattermann , 1991 ; Goswami , 1992 ) , but knowledge alone cannot explain these children’s long - term gains in reasoning skills . Inhibitory - control skills may be particularly influential , because they were a distinct predictor of children’s analogy development from the composite executive - function task . These results provide further evidence that strengthening early executive - function skills ( see Diamond & Lee , 2011 ) , particularly inhibitory control , should be part of the growing national discourse around early childhood education as a tool to maximize children’s potential for future academic and pro - fessional success . Supporting the development of analogical reasoning may help students become more innovative , adap - tive , and intelligent , which are qualities necessary for success in the global economy today ( National Research Council , 2012 ) .
