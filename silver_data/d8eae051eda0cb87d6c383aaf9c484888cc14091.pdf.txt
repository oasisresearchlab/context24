Voth * Department of Microbiology and Immunology , University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences , Little Rock , AR , USA Intracellular bacterial pathogens replicate within eukaryotic cells and display unique adaptations that support key infection events including invasion , replication , immune evasion , and dissemination . From invasion to dissemination , all stages of the intracellular bacterial life cycle share the same three - dimensional cytosolic space containing the host cytoskeleton . For successful infection and replication , many pathogens hijack the cytoskeleton using effector proteins introduced into the host cytosol by specialized secretion systems . A subset of effectors contains eukaryotic - like motifs that mimic host proteins to exploit signaling and modify speciﬁc cytoskeletal components such as actin and microtubules . Cytoskeletal rearrangement promotes numerous events that are beneﬁcial to the pathogen , including internalization of bacteria , structural support for bacteria - containing vacuoles , altered vesicular trafﬁcking , actin - dependent bacterial movement , and pathogen dissemination . This review highlights a diverse group of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that manipulate the host cytoskeleton to thrive within eukaryotic cells and discusses underlying molecular mechanisms that promote these dynamic host - pathogen interactions . Keywords : intracellular , bacteria , actin , cytoskeleton , pathogen INTRODUCTION Obligate intracellular bacteria comprise a group of highly infectious human pathogens that cause a spectrum of life threatening diseases . These bacteria demonstrate remarkable adaptations that support intracellular lifestyles comprised of unique challenges and advantages . To support diverse infection events , intracellular pathogens have evolved numerous methods to subvert host molecular signaling machinery that controls essential cellular functions . Intracellular pathogens display tropism for speciﬁc eukaryotic cell types and attach to these cells to initiate internalization , allowing intracellular growth using energy rich host metabolic products . Successful immune evasion is essential for productive infection , and the intracellular environment provides temporary cover from detection by immune cells and antibody / compliment - mediated immunity . Following replication , these pathogens exit the infected cell and disseminate to additional sites of infection . The cytoskeleton is a major host structural component manipulated by intracellular pathogens to drive cellular infection . The cytoskeleton is a three - dimensional network of polymeric proteins that provides structural support and assists numerous vital cellular functions . The cytoskeletal network also functions as a highway to directionally transport cargo - containing Colonne et al . Intracellular Pathogens Usurp the Cytoskeleton vesicles throughout the cell . Intracellular bacteria encounter the host cytoskeletal components actin and microtubules throughout growth and have adapted to use these networks to facilitate infection . Recent studies have broadened understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling bacteria - cytoskeleton interactions and their impact on cellular infection . Here , we focus on cytoskeletal manipulation by obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens generally considered non - cultivatable in vitro . These human pathogens include Chlamydia ( major cause of sexually transmitted disease ) , Rickettsia ( Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever , Mediterranean Spotted Fever , and epidemic typhus ) , Anaplasma ( human granulocytic anaplasmosis ) , and Ehrlichia ( human monocytic ehrlichiosis ) species . We also include the Q fever agent Coxiella burnetii , which replicates exclusively within host cells during natural infection , but can be cultured in specialized axenic media in vitro . The interaction of these pathogens with the host cytoskeletal network has been studied for many years , but detailed molecular mechanisms are lacking due to diﬃculty in genetically manipulating these bacteria . However , recent genetic breakthroughs provide tractable systems by which bacteria - actin interactions can now be deﬁned for this intriguing group of pathogens ( Beare et al . , 2009 , 2012 ; Burkhardt et al . , 2011 ; Clark et al . , 2011 ; Wood et al . , 2012 ; Cheng et al . , 2013 ; Crosby et al . , 2014 ) . We highlight how each pathogen hijacks host cytoskeletal machinery to facilitate infection events including invasion , intracellular replication , and dissemination . MAMMALIAN CELL HIGHWAYS : MULTI - FUNCTIONAL DYNAMIC CYTOSKELETAL NETWORKS The mammalian cytoskeleton consists of three major components : microﬁlaments , microtubules , and intermediate ﬁlaments . Microﬁlaments are composed of globular ( G ) - actin that hydrolyzes ATP to provide energy for F - actin polymerization ( Reisler , 1993 ; Graceﬀa and Dominguez , 2003 ) . Actin nucleation is the assembly of actin monomers into short multimers and requires nucleating factors such as actin related protein 2 / 3 ( Arp2 / 3 ) and formins . The Arp 2 / 3 complex consists of seven evolutionarily conserved subunits that bind to Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome ( WASP ) proteins to initiate nucleation . ( Egile et al . , 2005 ; Pollard , 2007 ) . Additional proteins such as proﬁlin , thymosin , and coﬁlin , are also directly involved in regulating actin polymerization ( Carlsson et al . , 1977 ; Goldschmidt - Clermont et al . , 1992 ) . Mammalian cells respond to extracellular stimuli by rearranging the cytoskeleton via activity of intracellular signaling cascades . The Rho family of small GTP - binding proteins , including Rho , Rac , and Cdc42 , regulates actin microﬁlament dynamics ( Ridley , 2006 ; Bustelo et al . , 2007 ) . Rho proteins are activated by phosphorylation and activate downstream target proteins to control actin polymerization . Microtubules are hetero - polymers composed of α - and β - tubulin , and microtubule organizing centers ( MTOCs ) provide a platform for assembly of the asymmetric microtubule network ( Vinogradova et al . , 2009 ) . Microﬁlaments and microtubules serve multifunctional roles in processes such as cell migration and intracellular vesicular traﬃcking , and provide structural support for the cell . Intermediate ﬁlaments are formed by many proteins , including the most widely distributed ﬁlament protein vimentin . Intermediate ﬁlaments perform several structural functions including anchoring organelles in the cytoplasm and maintaining cell shape and integrity ( Kirmse et al . , 2007 ; Nekrasova et al . , 2011 ) . INTRUDER ALERT : USING RAPID ACTIN POLYMERIZATION TO INVADE HOST CELLS Host cell entry is the ﬁrst step in the intracellular pathogen invasion process . Bacterial cell wall components facilitate attachment to speciﬁc host cells via distinct receptors . Pathogens use the rearranging abilities of actin to facilitate rapid entry into the host cell , with phagocytic and non - phagocytic cells internalizing bacteria by diﬀerent mechanisms ( Figure 1A ) . Bacterial cell surface antigen interaction with phagocytic cell receptors activates actin rearrangement to form membrane protrusions and internalize the pathogen ( Carabeo et al . , 2002 ; Martinez and Cossart , 2004 ; Martinez et al . , 2005 ; Rosales et al . , 2012 ) . Non - phagocytic cells internalize bacteria by “zipper” or “trigger” mechanisms activated by the pathogen . Cytoskeletal rearrangement at the bacterial attachment site is a conserved feature of entry in phagocytic and non - phagocytic cells . Actin rearrangement is triggered by activation of host kinase signaling and pathogens target distinct kinases . The zipper mechanism occurs following interaction of a bacterial protein with a host cell receptor , triggering intracellular signaling via activation of adaptor proteins and kinases , and stimulating ﬁlamentous actin rearrangement and endocytosis . The trigger method is mechanically and morphologically distinct from the zipper strategy and initiates when bacteria inject eﬀector proteins into the host cell using a specialized secretion system . These bacterial eﬀector molecules activate host GTPases and promote cytoskeletal rearrangement to trigger internalization ( Alonso and Garcia - del Portillo , 2004 ) . C . burnetii preferentially infects phagocytic human macrophages via binding to CR3 receptors , triggering reorganization of ﬁlamentous actin at the attachment site ( Meconi et al . , 1998 ) . Cytoskeletal ruﬄing is stimulated by activation of Src tyrosine kinases such as haemopoietic cell kinase ( Hck ) and Lyn . Hck phosphorylates WASP and regulates WASP - dependent actin polymerization ( Shi et al . , 2009 ) . Inhibition of Src activity prevents actin ruﬄing and C . burnetii entry into host cells ( Meconi et al . , 2001 ) , and Rho GTPases regulate internalization into phagocytic and non - phagocytic cells . Expression of dominant negative mutants or siRNA - mediated silencing of RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 , signiﬁcantly reduces C . burnetii entry into host cells ( Salinas et al . , 2015 ) . Rho GTPases may directly control internalization by regulating actin remodeling at the bacterial attachment site , and RhoA eﬀector proteins such as mDia1 and ROCK are also required for entry . Additionally , the actin regulator cortactin plays a role in C . burnetii entry into non - phagocytic cells . The cortactin SH3 Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 2 September 2016 | Volume 6 | Article 107 Colonne et al . Intracellular Pathogens Usurp the Cytoskeleton FIGURE 1 | Intracellular bacteria use host actin for diverse infection events . Intracellular bacteria actively manipulate the host actin cytoskeleton to facilitate major lifecycle events , such as cellular invasion , intracellular replication , and dissemination . Arrows indicate activation of speciﬁc host cell components . ( A ) Host cell entry : In non - phagocytic cells , bacteria use a zipper ( Rickettsia ) or trigger ( Chlamydia ) mechanism to facilitate infection . Phagocytic cells engulf bacterial pathogens ( C . burnetii and E . chaffeensis ) by phagocytosis . To promote uptake , bacteria actively remodel actin at the attachment site by activating host kinase signaling cascades . ( B ) Intracellular life : Some cytosolic bacteria ( SFG Rickettsia ) form actin tails to facilitate mobility within the cell . Pathogens that reside within membrane - bound vacuoles ( Chlamydia , C . burnetii , and E . chaffeensis ) manipulate the cytoskeleton to facilitate vacuole formation and stability . ( C ) Host cell escape : One group of bacteria ( SFG Rickettsia ) use actin - based motility to exit infected cells and move into non - infected bystander cells . Some host membrane - bound pathogen - containing vacuoles are pinched off by extrusion ( Chlamydia ) , a process that requires actin remodeling . Other intracellular bacteria actively remodel actin at the host cell surface to form membrane protrusions ( E . chaffeensis ) , connecting infected and uninfected neighboring cells . Bacteria are then transported through protrusions into neighboring cells to start a new infection cycle . T3SS , type III secretion system ; T4SS , type IV secretion system ; FcR , Fc Receptor ; CR , Complement Receptor . domain and serine phosphorylation are required for eﬃcient internalization and active cortactin binds F - actin to facilitate recruitment of Arp 2 / 3 ( Rosales et al . , 2012 ) . However , it is not known if cortactin functions in C . burnetii internalization by phagocytic cells ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Daly , 2004 ) . Rickettsia spp . use a zipper - like mechanism termed “induced phagocytosis” to invade non - phagocytic cells ( Walker and Winkler , 1978 ; Walker , 1984 ) . R . conorii invasion requires actin rearrangement via recruitment and activation of Arp2 / 3 ( Martinez and Cossart , 2004 ) following interaction with the host cell receptor Ku70 ( Martinez et al . , 2005 ) . This event is triggered by rickettsial rOmpB binding to host Ku70 , activating intracellular signaling . Additionally , Src , PI - 3 kinase ( PI - 3K ) , and Cdc42 activity are required for bacterial internalization ( Martinez Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 3 September 2016 | Volume 6 | Article 107 Colonne et al . Intracellular Pathogens Usurp the Cytoskeleton and Cossart , 2004 ) , and PI - 3K and Src are known regulators of Arp2 / 3 activity . The Src family member C - Src and cortactin localize to the bacterial entry site . Cdc42 is also recruited to the entry site and activates Arp2 / 3 to regulate actin polymerization via direct binding to WASP proteins ( Higgs and Pollard , 2001 ) . Interplay between these kinases regulates Arp2 / 3 activation and cytoskeleton rearrangement at the bacterial attachment site , allowing bacterial internalization . C . trachomatis enters non - phagocytic cells by a “trigger” mechanism . Delivery of proteins into the host cell via a type III secretion system is essential for bacterial entry ( Muschiol et al . , 2006 ; Wolf et al . , 2006 ) , and translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein ( Tarp ) is a secreted protein directly involved in cytoskeletal remodeling . Tarp contains an actin binding domain that promotes actin nucleation and a proline rich domain involved in nucleation of new ﬁlaments ( Jewett et al . , 2006 ) . Upon entering the host cytosol , Tarp is phosphorylated and acts as a scaﬀold for binding to host proteins such as Sos1 and Vav2 , known Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) ( Lane et al . , 2008 ) . These GEFs activate Rac GTPases required for actin rearrangement ( Carabeo et al . , 2004 ) , promoting Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin recruitment to the site of invasion . Actin rearrangement also promotes formation of pedestal - like structures , leading to bacterial internalization into membrane bound vesicles ( Carabeo et al . , 2002 ) . Interactions between the tick - borne pathogen A . phagocytophilum and the cytoskeleton have been largely studied in tick cells . However , only limited information is available regarding function of the tick cell cytoskeleton in pathogen infection . Altered actin dynamics in tick cells have been observed following A . phagocytophilum invasion and are implicated as a mechanism for intracellular survival rather than entry ( Sultana et al . , 2010 ) . Indeed , A . phagocytophilum infection triggers actin phosphorylation and inhibits actin polymerization , increasing the presence of nuclear G - actin and inducing expression of salp16 that supports bacterial survival ( Sultana et al . , 2010 ) . Cytoskeletal rearrangement is also important during A . phagocytophilum invasion of neutrophils . Treatment with the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D prevents A . phagocytophilum entry into HL - 60 cells , a model of neutrophil infection ( IJdo et al . , 2007 ) . A . phagocytophilum binding to neutrophil P - selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 ( PSGL - 1 ) is essential for invasion ( Herron et al . , 2000 ; Sarkar et al . , 2007 ) , and PSGL - 1 signaling activates Syk , followed by activation of the kinase ROCK - 1 . Syk depletion or blocking PSGL - 1 activation inhibits ROCK - 1 phosphorylation and prevents bacterial entry ( Carlyon et al . , 2003 ) . ROCK - 1 regulates actin remodeling , and ROCK - 1 - dependent cytoskeletal rearrangements may be required for bacterial invasion . However , A . phagocytophilum - infected primary human neutrophils do not display substantial actin rearrangement . Thus , further studies are needed to delineate the role of cytoskeletal remodeling in A . phagocytophilum invasion of neutrophils . E . chaﬀeensis targets human monocytes / macrophages for replication within the host . E . chaﬀeensis triggers internalization using the invasin EtpE , which binds to the host glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored protein DNase X located on the cell surface . This interaction triggers cytoskeletal rearrangement and ﬁlopodia formation ( Moumène et al . , 2015 ) . CD147 interacts with the EtpE - DNase X complex and is recruited to entry foci ( Mohan Kumar et al . , 2015 ) . Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K also interacts with CD147 and N - WASP , which is recruited to entry foci and triggers actin rearrangement required for bacterial entry . Additionally , a recent study demonstrated the importance of host Wnt signaling in E . chaﬀeensis uptake by macropahges . Luo et al showed that ehrlichial TRP120 stimulates phagocytosis and requires activation of the Wnt pathway ( Luo et al . , 2016 ) , establishing a link between an E . chaﬀeensis eﬀector and host cell uptake . HIDE OR RIDE : CYTOSKELETAL REMODELING TO BUILD AN INTRACELLULAR HOME After entering a host cell , bacteria encounter a potentially hostile environment . Internalized bacteria are subjected to host cell responses including phagolysosomal degradation and exposure to reactive oxygen species . Intracellular pathogens have evolved methods to subvert these responses and create a niche that allows replication ( Figure 1B ) . However , one method is often insuﬃcient , and pathogens hijack many signaling pathways to manipulate the host cellular response and cytoskeleton . After entering a host cell , Rickettsia escape the phagosome before lysosomal fusion . Failure to escape results in bacterial degradation in a phagolysosome . After escape , Spotted Fever Group Rickettsia , such as R . rickettsii and R . conorii , stimulate actin polymerization to form an actin tail that provides bacterial motility within the cell . This motility occurs in two independent phases dictated by the rickettsial protein involved . RickA localizes to the bacterial pole and facilitates actin polymerization that promotes early slow movement of bacteria through the cytoplasm shortly after uptake into a eukaryotic cell . RickA contains a WASP homology 2 ( WH2 ) domain that binds to actin monomers and WASP proteins . RickA ultimately activates the Arp2 / 3 complex , promoting actin polymerization and intracellular motility ( Gouin et al . , 2004 ; Jeng et al . , 2004 ) . Later during infection , the rickettsial autotransporter Sca2 , which resembles host formin homology proteins , is required for actin tail formation that promotes fast , directional motility ( Haglund et al . , 2010 ; Kleba et al . , 2010 ; Madasu et al . , 2013 ) . This faster mode of movement is independent of RickA and Arp2 / 3 and requires polar localization of Sca2 ( Reed et al . , 2014 ) . Members of the Typhus Group Rickettsia , such as R . prowazekii , do not form actin tails but replicate in the host cytosol following phagosomal escape ( Silverman et al . , 1980 ; Winkler and Turco , 1988 ) . Chlamydia replicate within host membrane - derived compartments termed inclusions . Following invasion of a host cell , nascent Chlamydia elementary bodies are traﬃcked toward the Golgi apparatus and perinuclear region near the minus end of microtubules , aggregating at the MTOC ( Grieshaber et al . , 2003 ) . Inclusion development requires intracellular traﬃcking , and cytoskeletal interactions are necessary for optimal inclusion formation . Actin , microtubules , and intermediate ﬁlaments organize around the inclusion , forming a cytoskeletal cage Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 4 September 2016 | Volume 6 | Article 107 Colonne et al . Intracellular Pathogens Usurp the Cytoskeleton ( Campbell et al . , 1989 ; Kumar and Valdivia , 2008 ) . Compact , uniform F - actin rings surround inclusions and are essential to maintain vacuole morphology and integrity . RhoA , but not Rac1 or Cdc42 , is required for actin assembly around the inclusion . Additionally , intermediate ﬁlament assembly requires Rho - mediated F - actin assembly to stabilize inclusions ( Kumar and Valdivia , 2008 ) . E . chaﬀeensis , A . phagocytophilum , and C . burnetii also replicate within host membrane - derived vacuoles . E . chaﬀeensis may manipulate the cytoskeleton through SUMOylation - dependent protein - protein interactions between bacterial eﬀectors and host cytoskeletal components . During invasion , the E . chaﬀeensis protein TRP120 is secreted into the host cell cytosol via a type I secretion system and is SUMOylated by host proteins . SUMOylated TRP120 interacts with γ - actin and the myosin component Myo10 . Manipulation of Myo10 , which is involved in microtubule cargo traﬃcking , may direct a supply of nutrients to expanding E . chaﬀeensis vacuoles , promoting bacterial replication ( Dunphy et al . , 2014 ) . During biogenesis of the A . phagocytophilum - containing vacuole , the intermediate ﬁlament vimentin is organized around the vacuole , potentially providing structural stability to the compartment ( Sukumaran et al . , 2011 ) . Mechanisms that control vimentin rearrangement around the vacuole have not been characterized . However , the A . phagocytophilum protein AptA directly interacts with vimentin and localizes around inclusions ( Sukumaran et al . , 2011 ) . AptA activates host Erk1 / 2 , and reorganization of vimentin around inclusions is essential for kinase activation . Moreover , vimentin and Erk1 / 2 activation are required for optimal A . phagocytophilum growth in host cells ( Sukumaran et al . , 2011 ) , indicating a critical role for intermediate ﬁlaments in A . phagocytophilum infection . C . burnetii replicates within an acidic compartment termed the parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) in macrophages . F - actin assembles around the PV and is required for optimal vacuole formation ( Aguilera et al . , 2009 ) . However , detailed mechanisms that regulate actin dynamics around the PV have not been fully characterized . Studies in our laboratory demonstrated that C . burnetii hijacks cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) signaling using a type IV secretion system , and this process is essential for PV formation ( MacDonald et al . , 2012 ; Macdonald et al . , 2014 ) . Ongoing studies are investigating a possible role for PKA activity in altering F - actin dynamics around the PV . COMING OUT OF HIDING : PATHOGEN HOST CELL EXIT STRATEGIES Although creating a replication niche within host cells provides temporary cover from host immune defenses , bacterial pathogens have also developed exit strategies ( Figure 1C ) to disseminate within the host . The host cytoskeletal network that provides structural rigidity near the plasma membrane may interfere with bacterial exit . Obligate intracellular pathogens can exit host cells by cell - to - cell spread , host cell lysis , or extrusion of bacteria - containing compartments ( Hybiske and Stephens , 2007 , 2008 ; Thomas et al . , 2010 ) . The success of these exit strategies depends on eﬃcient actin rearrangement . Some intracellular bacteria exit by host cell lysis and cell - to - cell spreading mechanisms . However , host cell lysis directly releases large numbers of bacteria and host cytosolic components into the bloodstream , potentially triggering an immune response , and necessitating cell - to - cell spread to disseminate with minimal detection . Spotted Fever group Rickettsia use actin tails for propulsion into ﬁlopodia where bacteria can be released extracellularly into the bloodstream or enter adjacent cells ( Van Kirk et al . , 2000 ; Heinzen , 2003 ) . Actin - mediated propulsion provides a mechanism for pathogen spread from cell - to - cell without exposure to host immune cells . However , exit of Rickettsia through host cell membranes causes endothelial cell damage and vascular leakage , resulting in characteristic pathologies ( i . e . , rash ) observed in infected patients . Typhus group Rickettsia do not form actin tails ( Heinzen et al . , 1993 ) , but replicate to high numbers in endothelial cells until the cell ruptures and bacteria disseminate in the bloodstream . E . chaﬀeensis uses two diﬀerent exit strategies during early and late stages of infection ( Thomas et al . , 2010 ) . During early stages , infected host cells form protrusions consisting of ﬁlopodia . E . chaﬀeensis is transported into ﬁlopodia that extend into neighboring cells , providing a direct path for bacterial entry into nearby cells without immune detection . Actin rearrangement in infected cells is essential for ﬁlopodia formation and bacterial localization into ﬁlopodia . However , during late stages of infection , bacteria exit following host cell lysis ( Thomas et al . , 2010 ) . Regarding Anaplasma , it has been suggested that A . phagocytophilum exits host granulocytes by exocytosis and host cell lysis . However , speciﬁc roles for cytoskeletal components during pathogen exit have not been characterized ( Rikihisa , 2010 ) . Chlamydia can exit host cells by host cell lysis or extrusion of the inclusion . Extrusion requires actin rearrangement and is considered an exocytosis - like process . Extrusion initiates with formation of inclusion - containing protrusions from infected cells . Extrusions are then pinched into separable compartments located at the cell periphery , allowing inclusion release without triggering cell death ( Todd and Caldwell , 1985 ; Hybiske and Stephens , 2007 ) . Inhibition of actin polymerization and N - WASP activity completely prevents extrusion , while preventing microtubule formation does not impact extrusion . Inhibition of myosin II , an ATP - dependent motor protein that interacts with actin ﬁlaments , also prevents extrusion . Inhibition of Rho GTPases does not impact protrusion formation , but arrests extrusion at the pinching step ( Todd and Caldwell , 1985 ; Hybiske and Stephens , 2007 ) . CONCLUSIONS Obligate intracellular bacteria include a unique group of human pathogens that have adapted to thrive within the host cell environment . These pathogens hijack host cell signaling by secreting bacterial eﬀector proteins into the host cytosol to promote formation of a replication - permissive niche . Intracellular bacteria constantly encounter Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology | www . frontiersin . org 5 September 2016 | Volume 6 | Article 107 Colonne et al . Intracellular Pathogens Usurp the Cytoskeleton the dynamic host cytoskeletal network and have evolved methods to use actin and related proteins to facilitate infection . Intracellular pathogens rearrange the actin cytoskeleton during internalization by phagocytic and non - phagocytic host cells . Some intracellular bacteria replicate within a specialized membrane - bound vacuole , while others replicate free in the cytosol . Host cytoskeletal proteins often form a ﬁlamentous cage around bacteria - containing vacuoles , providing structural support and allowing vesicle fusion with the vacuole . Other intracellular bacteria stimulate actin polymerization and form actin tails that aid bacterial movement within the host cytosol and propulsion into neighboring cells . Intracellular bacteria further manipulate the actin cytoskeleton to exit host cells by lysis or vacuole extrusion . In conclusion , major events in bacterial lifecycles require host cytoskeletal components , and blocking these interactions negatively impacts bacterial replication . However , we clearly have more to learn about the molecular mechanisms controlling pathogen interaction with the host cytoskeleton . Targeting these interactions may provide novel approaches to develop antibacterial therapeutics targeting obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens .
