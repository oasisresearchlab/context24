Experiments on endocytosis in yeast all agree that ( i ) actin polymerizes into a network of ﬁlaments exerting active forces on the membrane to deform it and ( ii ) the large scale membrane deformation is tubular in shape . There are three competing proposals , in contrast , for precisely how the actin ﬁlament network organizes itself to drive the deformation . We use variational ap - proaches and numerical simulations to address this competition by analyzing a meso - scale model of actin - mediated endocytosis in yeast . The meso - scale model breaks up the invagination process into three stages : ( i ) initiation , where clathrin interacts with the membrane via adaptor proteins , ( ii ) elongation , where the membrane is then further deformed by polymerizing actin ﬁlaments , followed by ( iii ) pinch - oﬀ . Our results suggest that the pinch - oﬀ mechanism may be assisted by a pearling - like instability . We rule out two of the three competing proposals for the organization of the actin ﬁlament network during the elongation stage . These two proposals could possibly be important in the pinch - oﬀ stage , however , where additional actin polymerization helps break oﬀ the vesicle . Implications and comparisons with earlier modeling of endocytosis in yeast are discussed . I . INTRODUCTION Endocytosis is the process by which extracellular agents are ingested by the cell as a result of the cell mem - brane surrounding and engulﬁng them [ 1 ] . The mem - brane then pinches oﬀ to form a vesicle that encloses the now intracellular material . Fig . 1 presents an elec - tron micrograph image of a deformed cell membrane near pinch - oﬀ in S . cerevisiae [ 2 ] . Experiments have identiﬁed a handful of core proteins , though there are upwards of 50 proteins participating in the endocytotic machinery [ 3 – 5 ] . Live cell imaging of these ﬂuorescently labeled core proteins provide us with a sequence of events for the en - docytotic machinery [ 6 , 7 ] . Though the composition and time - line of the endocytotic machinery is known , in yeast , there are competing proposals about how these few core proteins interact with the cell membrane to deform it into a vesicle [ 9 – 11 ] . We address these competing qualitative proposals by quantitatively comparing them . The sequence of events in the endocytotic machinery in yeast is as follows [ 8 , 12 ] . Clathrin is recruited to the invagination site [ 13 ] , along with adaptor proteins , such as Sla1 and Ent1 / 2 [ 5 ] . Sla1 and Ent1 / 2 proteins bind the clathrin to the membrane , while Sla2 proteins bind actin ﬁlaments to the membrane [ 5 ] . Another protein , WASp , is also recruited to the site . WASp is an activa - tor for the branching agent Arp2 / 3 , enabling a branched actin ﬁlament network to be generated near the invagina - tion site [ 6 ] . The growth of this network drives membrane tube formation . BAR proteins eventually become promi - nent and help facilitate pinch - oﬀ of the membrane [ 14 ] . Fig . 2 illustrates this process using what will turn out to be Proposal 1 for the organization of the actin .

The image is reprinted with permission from Ref . 2 . The scale bar is 100 nm . initial invagination due to clathrin and other adaptor pro - teins takes about one to two minutes . The time for the tube to form and pinch - oﬀ , in contrast , takes only about 10 - 15 seconds . The length - to - radius ratio of the tube before pinch - oﬀ is typically 7 - 10 [ 2 ] ( Fig . 1 ) . The role of clathrin is rather clear . The spontaneous curvature of individual clathrin molecules helps initiate membrane deformation as they indirectly attach to the membrane via adaptor proteins . How the actin ﬁlament network reshapes the membrane , on the other hand , is not as clear . There are currently three competing propos - als put forth by the biologists as to how this is done . The ﬁrst proposal ( Proposal 1 ) argues that the barbed / plus ends of polymerizing actin ﬁlaments are oriented towards the ﬂat part of the membrane with the pointed / minus ends anchored just above the clathrin bowl [ 9 ] . A second proposal ( Proposal 2 ) argues that a collar - like structure 2 ( a ) ( b ) Proposal 1 ( c ) ( d ) FIG . 2 : Schematic for endocytosis in yeast using Proposal 1 for the actin ﬁlament organization : ( a ) Clathrin ( purple ) attaches to the membrane ( black / blue ) via proteins Sla1 and Ent1 / 2 ( not depicted here ) and the protein Sla2 ( green / brown ) is recruited near the clathrin . ( b ) Actin ( red ) attaches to the membrane near the edge of the clathrin “bowl” via Sla2 and lengthens due to polymerization to initiate tube formation . ( c ) Actin continues to polymerize and lengthen the tube . ( d ) BAR proteins ( orange ) become prominent and surround part of the tube ( and the actin ) . The grey arrows denote the direction of the actin force on the membrane . of plus end ﬁlaments anchored to the rest of the cytoskele - ton and oriented towards the neck of the deformation to elongate it and drive the pinch - oﬀ [ 10 ] . A third proposal ( Proposal 3 ) suggests that there are two regions of attach - ment of the actin ﬁlaments to the membrane such that two branched actin networks are generated [ 11 ] . The two networks repel each other as they grow because they can - not interpenetrate and , therefore , drive tube formation . ( a ) Proposal 2 X X ( b ) Proposal 3 FIG . 3 : ( a ) Schematic depicts Proposal 2 , where the actin ﬁl - aments are tethered to the rest of the cytoskeleton , as denoted by the two black Xs , and polymerize inward towards the in - vagination site . ( b ) Schematic represents Proposal 3 , where there are two local anchoring regions such that two actin net - works form to drive tube formation . The grey arrows , again , denote the direction of the actin force on the membrane . See Fig . 2b for a schematic of Proposal 1 and Fig . 3 for a schematic for Proposals 2 and 3 . Each of these three proposals for endocytosis in yeast assumes its own respective organization for the actin ﬁl - ament network . Can any of these models be ruled out on the basis that they do not provide the forces required to deform the cell membrane that is consistent with obser - vations ? And what about the mechanism for pinch - oﬀ ? Is there any underlying instability , or is there a more architectured approach ? We approach clathrin - initiated endoctyosis in yeast by breaking up the sequence of mem - brane deformations into three stages : ( i ) initiation , ( ii ) elongation , and ( iii ) pinch - oﬀ . In the process we identify a possible mechanism that could assist in the pinch - oﬀ via a pearling - like instability , where surface tension competes with bending energy in cylindrical vesicles such that , for long enough cylinders , it is energetically favorable for the cylinder to break up into spheres . An instability driven mechanism is potentially powerful given the ubiquitous - ness of endocytosis . This pearling - like instability mecha - nism will be contrasted with a competing pinch - oﬀ mech - anism in the ﬁnal section of the paper [ 9 , 15 ] . The paper is organized as follows . Section II intro - duces our cell membrane modelling approach to endocy - tosis , which is divided up into three stages as mentioned previously , while Section III presents the resulting cell membrane conﬁgurations for each stage . We conclude with Section IV by framing our results and discussing their implications . II . MODEL AND METHODS We model the cell membrane as an ideal two - dimensional surface residing in three - dimensional Eu - clidean space . This surface represents the neutral surface of the physical membrane and approximately corresponds to the contact between the two leaﬂets 3 of the lipid bilayer [ 16 ] . Mathematically , this sur - face is parametrized by curvilinear coordinates ( α 1 , α 2 ) and is described by radius vectors ~ r = ~ r ( α 1 , α 2 ) ≡ ( x ( α 1 , α 2 ) , y ( α 1 , α 2 ) , z ( α 1 , α 2 ) ) . Using standard meth - ods of diﬀerential geometry of surfaces [ 17 ] , we then de - ﬁne the mean ( H ) and Gaussian ( K ) curvatures of the surface . The energy of a bare membrane depends on its curva - ture [ 1 ] and can be written as E bare = Z dS h 2 κ ( H − C 0 ) 2 + κ G K + σ i , ( 1 ) where C 0 is a spontaneous curvature , κ is the membrane bending rigidity , κ G is the saddle - splay modulus , σ rep - resents the surface tension , and dS represents the area of an inﬁnitesimal element of the surface . Beginning with the above energy functional , which models the energy of the deformations of a bare cellular membrane , we systematically incorporate new physics as - sociated with the three stages of endocytosis by allowing the parameters to be component - dependent or by adding new terms to the energy . A . Initiation stage Clathrin is one of the ﬁrst proteins recruited to the endocytic site . Each clathrin molecule is a nonplanar triskelion that can pucker in the center [ 19 ] . Clathrin molecules bind together to form a basket - like structure as a result of the intrinsic curvature of the molecules . Clathrin molecules , however , require adaptor proteins , such as Sla1 and Ent1 / 2 , to bind to the membrane [ 5 , 20 ] . The binding process induces curvature in the membrane . The membrane rigidity may also be aﬀected by protein binding . In fact , membrane rigidities depend on several factors , such as membrane lipid and protein composition , to account for the range of values ( tens of k B T ) that is reported in the literature [ 21 ] . We encode the eﬀect of the clathrin binding , via Sla1 and Ent1 / 2 , to the cell membrane with eﬀective parame - ters characterizing the model of the cell membrane . The clathrin indirectly binding to one side of the membrane induces spontaneous curvature in the membrane . Since the clathrin indirectly binds only to part of the mem - brane , we study a two - component membrane , one com - ponent denoting the bare membrane and the other de - noting the part of the membrane to which the clathrin is indirectly attached with non - zero spontaneous curva - ture . We also vary the bending rigidity of the part of the membrane to which the clathrin is indirectly attached . The energy functional of the membrane for this initia - tion stage is given by [ 1 ] E init = X i = 1 , 2 Z dS i h 2 κ i ( H i − C 0 i ) 2 + κ G i K i + σ i i ( 2 ) where i = 1 denotes the Sla1 / Ent1 / 2 - bound membrane and i = 2 denotes the bare membrane . B . Elongation stage We now ask how the emergent actin network exerts additional deformations / forces on the membrane follow - ing the initiation of endocytosis . As shown in Fig . 2 , the protein Sla2 is recruited to the invagination site be - fore actin assembly . Sla2 binds to the clathrin and the membrane near the clathrin , but only Sla2 bound to the membrane near the top of the clathrin basket binds actin ﬁlaments [ 5 ] . These Sla2 binding sites provide localized binding / anchoring of the actin ﬁlaments to the cell mem - brane since these Sla2 molecules are near the top of the clathrin basket , i . e . ”butting” up against the elastic clathrin basket . Assuming the minus end of the actin ﬁlament anchors to the cell membrane via Sla2 , the plus end then polymerizes upward and ratchets against the cell membrane . The asymmetry between anchoring at the minus end and ratcheting at the plus end provides a force to invaginate the membrane further into the cell . Actin ﬁlament nucleation via Arp2 / 3 increases this force . We , therefore , model the actin ﬁlament network as an applied force on the membrane localized at these Sla2 anchoring points . The magnitude of this force is related to the total number of actin ﬁlaments participating in the network , and this number has been computed based on a combination of experimental data and kinetic mod - elling [ 22 , 23 ] . We use the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the emer - gent actin network to determine the force applied to the membrane . Given the observed tubular structure of the deformation , this actin force is assumed to be axisym - metric with constant components in the radial and − z ( downward ) directions , i . e . ~ F act = F ρ ~ e ρ + F z ~ e z . The actin force is imposed by adding a linear potential of the form V act ( ρ , ϕ , z ) = − ( F ρ ρ + F z z ) to the energy for the part of the membrane to which the force is locally ap - plied . The energy functional for the elongation stage is E elong = E init + Z d ~ r [ V act ( ρ , ϕ , z ) g ( ρ , ϕ , z ) + V ster ( ρ , ϕ , z ) + V pin ( ρ , ϕ , z ) ] , ( 3 ) where g ( ρ , ϕ , z ) = 1 for the region over which the actin force is applied and zero otherwise . To distinguish be - tween Proposals 1 , 2 , and 3 , we explore diﬀerent an - choring regions and diﬀerent ratios of the force compo - nents . Note also that V ster ( ρ , ϕ , z < 0 ) = ∞ for ρ > R ap and zero otherwise . This models the accumulation of the yeast actin cytoskeleton just beneath the cell membrane and near the tubular invagination as it emerges [ 10 , 24 ] . The ρ > R ap , z > 0 region acts as a “reservoir” for tube growth . We , therefore , impose an additional quadratic potential , V pin ( ρ , z ) = 12 βz 2 for ρ > R ap , where β is cho - sen so that the membrane outside this region remains ﬂat . Pinchoﬀ stage : Experiments indicate that the BAR proteins dominate in this last stage , after the tubular - like deformation forms [ 2 , 15 ] . This observation is rather per - plexing since BAR proteins , which themselves are curved , 4 can , sense and generate spontaneous curvature in the cell membrane [ 25 ] . In other words , why does actin play the dominant role in generating the tubular - like defor - mation and not the BAR proteins ? We suggest that once a tubular - like deformation occurs , the BAR proteins surround and conﬁne the tube - plus - actin ﬁlament net - work ( see Fig . 2 ( d ) ) to stop actin polymerization . The BAR proteins only sense curvature here , not generate it . Since actin polymerization is driven by a ratcheting eﬀect in a spatially ﬂuctuating ﬁlament network , when these spatially ﬂuctuations are supressed , actin polymer - ization stops . When the polymerization stops , no more membrance material can become part of the tube . In other words , the membrane tube area remains constant . With the BAR proteins conﬁning the actin ﬁlament net - work against the membrane , we introduce an additional energetic term to the system . We model the actin net - work as an underlying elastic network of springs . Because the actin network is now connected to the membrane ( as opposed to ratcheting against it in the elongation stage ) , the spring network depends on the conﬁguration of the membrane . More speciﬁcally , the BAR protein - plus - actin ﬁlament contribution to the energy of a now cylindrical membrane is [ 26 ] E BAR + actin = X < i , j > µ 2 [ ~ r i − ~ r j ] 2 , ( 4 ) where µ is the spring constant and i , j denotes the meshwork coordinates of the springs . Since the tube has now been formed , we will study a cylinder membrane described by Eq . ( 1 ) with this additional energy , E BAR + actin . This energy will turn out to raise the surface tension of the membrane . This calculation will also suggest a new pearling instability pinch - oﬀ mechanism for endocytosis in yeast . Methods : We utilize both analytical and numerical techniques to study the above model . On the numeri - cal side , we use simulated annealing Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulations to identify low - energy structures . In our simulations we represent the membrane using standard techniques for constructing discrete surface triangula - tions [ 27 ] . To ensure that we simulate a ﬂuid mem - brane , each MC step involves two steps [ 27 ] : i ) displace a vertex in a direction chosen at random uniformly from a cube [ − 0 . 05 l 0 , 0 . 05 l 0 ] 3 , where l 0 is the average edge length of the initial triangulation , and ii ) ﬂip an edge on a rhombus . This ﬂip removes an edge shared by two triangles and reconnects it so that it spans the opposite , previously unattached , vertices [ 28 , 29 ] . Moves are ac - cepted or rejected according to the Metropolis algorithm . The sweeps are continued until the total energy does not change with some prescribed precision . Diﬀerent random number generator seeds are used to ensure the repro - ducibility of the lowest energy conﬁgurations . A typical run with N v ≈ 3 . 5 × 10 3 vertices consists of ∼ 10 6 MC sweeps , with a sweep consisting of attempted moves of each vertex and attempted ﬂips of each edge . Any moves or edge ﬂips leading to unphysical self - intersection of the triangulation are rejected . This is achieved by endowing each vertex with a hard core of diameter b = 0 . 9 l 0 , and each edge with a tethering potential [ 27 ] with maximum length l max = 1 . 4 l 0 such that l max / b ≈ 1 . 55 . These values are chosen in accordance with Refs . [ 30 , 31 ] to be tight enough to prevent edge crossings but still allow edge - ﬂips , thus ensuring ﬂuidity . Finally , the actin forces are applied to the vertices . III . RESULTS A . Initiation stage with clathrin To analyze the equilibrium shapes of the membrane in the initiation stage , we use the Monge representation such that each coordinate on the membrane in three - dimensional space is parameterized by two planar coor - dinates x and y with ~ r = ( x , y , z ( x , y ) ) . We then assume axial symmetry so that ~ r = ( r , θ , z ( r ) ) . In the small gra - dient approximation Eq . ( 2 ) simpliﬁes to ( see Appendix A ) : E init [ z ( r ) ] ≈ X i = 1 , 2 Z R i R i − 1 πκ i r (cid:2) ( ∆ z ) 2 − 4 C 0 i ∆ z + (cid:18) 2 C 20 i + σ i κ i (cid:19) ( ∇ z ) 2 + (cid:18) 4 C 20 i + 2 σ i κ i (cid:19) (cid:3) dr + X i = 1 , 2 Z R i R i − 1 2 πκ G i (cid:18) dz dr d 2 z dr 2 (cid:19) dr + σ 0 2 π Z R 1 0 (cid:18) 1 + 1 2 ( ∇ z 1 ) 2 (cid:19) rdr − A ! + γ 2 πR 1 , ( 5 ) where A is the area of domain 1 ( the Sla1 / Ent1 / 2 bound component which is attached to the clathrin basket ) , and σ 0 is a Lagrange multiplier introduced to ﬁx the area of domain 1 . We have also introduced a line tension γ at the interface between the two components—the bare component and the Sla1 / Ent1 / 2 bound component [ 32 ] . Finally , the radial coordinate of the interface is denoted by R 1 , while R 2 denotes the outer edge of the membrane . We now proceed with the variation of the Lagrangian , δE init [ z ( r ) ] = δ R R 1 0 L 1 dr + δ R R 2 R 1 L 2 dr = 0 ( see Ap - pendix A ) . As for boundary conditions we demand that membrane be continuous at the interface between the two components so that z 1 ( R 1 ) = z 2 ( R 1 ) = z ( R 1 ) . In addition , the membrane cannot have ridges for the bend - ing energy to remain ﬁnite so that z 1 ′ ( R 1 ) = z 2 ′ ( R 1 ) = z ′ ( R 1 ) . For R 2 → + ∞ , we have z 2 ( R 2 ) = 0 so that z 2 ′ ( R 2 ) = 0 . The radial symmetry demands that z 1 ′ ( 0 ) = 0 . With these conditions , δz 1 , δz 2 , δR 1 , δz ′ ( R 1 ) , and δz 1 ( 0 ) are free variables , so the energy is minimized by solving the following equations : 5 ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 − d dr ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′ + d 2 dr 2 ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′′ = 0 ( 6 ) ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 − d dr ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 ′ + d 2 dr 2 ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 ′′ = 0 ( 7 ) (cid:20) L 1 − z 1 ′ (cid:18) ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′ − d dr ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′′ (cid:19) − z 1 ′′ ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′′ (cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R 1 = (cid:20) L 2 − z 2 ′ (cid:18) ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 ′ − d dr ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 ′′ (cid:19) − z 2 ′′ ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 ′′ (cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R 1 ( 8 ) (cid:20)(cid:18) ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′ − d dr ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′′ (cid:19) − (cid:18) ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 ′ − d dr ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 ′′ (cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12) r = R 1 = 0 ( 9 ) (cid:20) ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′′ − ∂ L 2 ∂z 2 ′′ (cid:21)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = R 1 = 0 ( 10 ) (cid:18) ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′ − d dr ∂ L 1 ∂z 1 ′′ (cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) r = 0 = 0 . ( 11 ) Solving Eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) leads to z 1 ( r ) = c 1 + c 2 log ( r ) + c 3 I 0 ( rξ 1 ) + c 4 K 0 ( rξ 1 ) z 2 ( r ) = c 5 + c 6 log ( r ) + c 7 I 0 ( rξ 2 ) + c 8 K 0 ( rξ 2 ) , ( 12 ) where ξ 21 = 2 C 201 + σ 1 + σ 0 κ 1 , ξ 22 = 2 C 202 + σ 2 κ 2 , and I 0 and K 0 denote the zeroth order modiﬁed Bessel functions of the ﬁrst and second kind . We can then use Eqs . ( 8 ) through ( 11 ) and the boundary conditions to determine these 8 coeﬃcients and σ 0 , R 1 . For typical parameters for the two - component mem - brane we use κ 1 = 20 k B T [ 33 ] , κ 2 = 10 k B T [ 21 ] , C 01 = 0 . 1 nm − 1 [ 34 ] , C 02 = 0 , κ G 1 = − 0 . 83 κ 1 [ 35 ] , κ G 2 = − 0 . 83 κ 2 , σ 1 = 0 . 18 k B T / nm 2 [ 36 ] , σ 2 = 0 . 18 k B T / nm 2 [ 36 ] , A = π 100 nm 2 , and γ = 3 k B T / nm [ 37 ] . Given these parameters , the equilibrium shape of the membrane is plotted in Fig . 4a . We see that a dimple emerges due to clathrin binding . This dimple ﬁnalizes the initiation stage of endocytosis in yeast and sets the radius of the imminent tubular invagination . Fig . 4a contains two additional curves to assess the eﬀect of non - zero Gaussian rigidity κ G . Prior work has found that diﬀerences in κ G across a boundary can drive tube formation in membranes [ 38 ] . We ﬁnd , given the above parameters , that it is the non - zero spontaneous curvature that instead drives the dimple formation . More precisely , for C 01 = 0 , no dimple forms and for non - zero C 01 and κ G , the depth of the dimple is enhanced only by about 14 percent . Before concluding this subsection , we must point out that our method diﬀers from an earlier two - component - 30 - 20 - 10 0 10 20 30 x ( nm ) - 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 0 z ( n m ) C 01 > 0 , κ G = 0 C 01 = 0 , κ G < 0 C 01 > 0 , κ G < 0 ( a ) 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 0 . 12 C 01 ( nm - 1 ) 0 2 4 6 8 D e p t h ( n m ) ( d ) FIG . 4 : ( a ) Cell membrane proﬁle , or z ( x , y = 0 ) , for the parameters stated in the text .

Both images have been rescaled accordingly for presentation purposes . ( d ) Compar - ison of the maximum depth ( or depth ) obtained from the numerical simulation ( symbols ) with the analytical solution ( line ) for the intiation stage . All the parameters , except for the varying C 01 , are the same as the κ G = 0 curve in Fig . 4a . “dimple” analysis [ 39 ] . First of all , Ref . [ 39 ] does not take into account the C 201 ( ∇ z ) 2 term [ 40 ] , which is needed for consistency in the small gradient expansion . Second , we take into account non - zero κ G because κ 1 6 = κ 2 . Thirdly , to solve for some of the coeﬃcients , the earlier work im - poses mechanical equilibrium conditions , as opposed to implementing boundary conditions in the variation of the Lagrangian directly . We also conduct numerical minimization of the intia - tion stage ( Figs . 4b and c ) . As a check on our simula - tions , we compare the maximum depth of the dimple , i . e . | z max ( r ) | , as a function of C 01 , for the analytical calcula - 6 tion with the numerical one in Fig . 4d . Here , each energy relaxation is performed starting from a ﬂat conﬁguration . We place a ﬂat patch of radius R 2 = 40 l 0 on a hard plane parallel to the xy plane . We then assign spontaneous cur - vature C 01 to all vertices in the central region of radius r C 01 = 6 l 0 . We use the energy functional in Eq . ( 2 ) with an additional interfacial line tension . Fig . 4d shows the output of the simulation for the same parameters used in Fig . 4a , except with additional C 01 values . We ﬁnd very good agreement between the two . Note that since non - zero κ G does not drive the dimple formation ( for the parameters studied ) , we do not include it here . B . Elongation stage via actin polymerization Now that the initial small deformation due to Sla1 / Ent1 / 2 binding the membrane to the clathrin bas - ket is formed , the overall radius of the tubular invagi - nation is set . The protein Sla2 next binds to and near the clathrin dimple . Only those Sla2 molecules bound near the top of the clathrin dimple also bind to the actin to form a ring - like structure of binding sites [ 5 ] . Since the clathrin dimple is elastic - like , it impedes motion of the Sla2 molecules near the top of the clathrin dimple such that these Sla2 binding sites provide for an anchor - ing of the actin ﬁlaments to the membrane to which a localized force can be exerted . As the actin ﬁlaments polymerize , the interaction of the polymerizing actin ﬁl - ament tips with the membrane is much more dynamic than the anchoring points since actin ﬁlaments polymer - ize via a ratcheting eﬀect . The membrane just provides a constraint for the growing ﬁlament tips to ratchet against along the length of the tube . This asymmetry in the force is needed for a deformation ( other than due to a random ﬂuctuation ) to occur . So we model the eﬀect of the an - chored at one end , and polymerizing at the other , actin ﬁlaments as a localized force on the membrane via the potential V actin , as indicated in Eq . ( 3 ) . In addition , the steric potential V ster models the accumulation of the yeast actin cytoskeleton just beneath the cell membrane and near the tubular invagination as it emerges [ 10 , 24 ] . How large is this force ? An estimate may be obtained from quantitative confocal microscopy measurements of 16 ﬂuorescently labelled proteins involved in endocyto - sis in ﬁssion yeast [ 22 ] . The mean peak for the number of G - actin molecules ( monomeric actin ) is approximately 7500 . Assuming all of these molecules polymerize to form actin ﬁlaments of about 100 nm in length [ 23 ] and each G - actin molecule is 2 . 7 nm in length ( 5 nm in diameter ) then each ﬁlament contains about 40 molecules . About 200 actin ﬁlaments would then be formed . Each actin ﬁlament contributes approximately 1 pN of force , since the stalling force of an individual actin ﬁlament is ap - proximately 1 pN [ 41 ] . The total force is then approxi - mately 200 pN , which is applied to the anchoring region of the actin ﬁlaments . Since we do not take into account dynamics explicitly , we will merely implement the ﬁnal value of the total force rather than increasing the force as the actin network develops . In the quasistatic limit the two approaches should be equivalent . We now turn to the direction of the actin polymeriza - tion force and review the three diﬀerent proposals for the actin ﬁlament orientation [ 10 , 11 , 15 ] . As shown in Fig . 2 , actin ﬁlaments polymerize “upward” and branch via Arp2 / 3 to drive the membrane further into the interior of the cell . In Proposal 1 , the force is predominantly downward , as opposed to radially inward , provided the initial actin ﬁlaments are aligned less than 45 degrees to the normal of the undeformed membrane . Assuming the orienation of the anchored actin ﬁlaments stays relatively ﬁxed as branched actin ﬁlaments are generated , then the magnitude of the total actin force increases , whilst re - maining ﬁxed in direction . Here we assume axial sym - metry so that there are only two non - zero components of the total force . How do the competing Proposals 2 and 3 compare with Proposal 1 ? In Proposal 2 the actin network grows in - ward from the outerlying cytoskeleton towards the in - vagination site . The actin network is anchored to the outerlying cytoskeleton , as opposed the cell membrane , via Sla2 . If we assume a purely radially inward force then the membrane will not deform into a tube with the observed length - to - radius ratio of approximately 10 . The branched structure of the actin network , however , can provide a downward component to the total force to elongate the tube ( Fig . 3a ) . We , therefore , distinguish Proposal 1 as a case where the downward component of the total polymerization force is smaller than the radially inward component , whilst in Proposal 2 , it is the reverse . Proposal 3 assumes that there are two anchoring zones for actin ﬁlaments—one towards the bottom of the emerging tube and another one near the top of the tube . From these two anchoring zones emerge two actin net - works simultaneously growing towards each other and , thus , repelling each other since the actin ﬁlaments can - not interpenetrate ( Fig . 3b ) . It is this repulsion that presumably elongates the tube . Coexistence of a down - ward force component and an upward force component , however , demands that the membrane simply stretches like a rubber band with no new cell membrane material being added to the tube . Because the cell membrane is bending dominated ( and not stretching dominated ) , Pro - posal 3 would presumably lead to rupture of the tube [ 42 ] . It is not as likely that Proposal 3 contributes to mem - brane tube formation and we do not study it further as an elongation mechanism . So we focus on Proposals 1 and 2 for the elongation stage by promoting them to Models 1 and 2 , respectively , and study them quantitatively . To gain some insight , we ﬁrst review a slightly simpler model . Consider a bare ( one - component ) membrane with downward force F applied just to the origin , as opposed to being ap - plied over an extended region of the membrane [ 43 ] . As - sume the membrane has bending rigidity κ and surface tension σ . For a cylindrically shaped membrane with 7 a length L and radius R , surface tension favors reduc - ing the radius of the cylinder / tube , while bending fa - vors a larger radius . Upon minimizing the energy , one obtains an equilibrium radius of R eq = p κ / 2 σ and an equilibrium force of F eq = 2 π √ 2 σκ . For forces less than F eq , the membrane deformation is a wide - necked depres - sion and reaches some equilibrium depth that depends on the force , while for forces greater than F eq there is a ﬁrst - order transition to a cylindrical shape of arbitrary length . Simulations of the membrane shape equation in - dicate that there is a force barrier from the wide - necked depression to cylinder formation that is 13 percent larger than F eq [ 43 ] . Barriers are a characteristic signature of ﬁrst - order transitions . Monte Carlo simulations of pure downward pulling on a membrane over an extended re - gion ( as opposed to a single point ) support this scenario with the force barrier increasing linearly with the size of the region over which the force is exerted [ 44 ] . Now consider Models 1 and 2 with an additional ra - dially inward force and a steric interaction between the membrane and the actin . To begin , we expect the radi - ally inward force to increase the force barrier to arbitrar - ily long cylindrical formation . We also expect the steric interaction to alter the transition since R ap cuts oﬀ the wide - neck depression and makes it easier to cross - over to long cylinder formation . More speciﬁcally , we expect that as R ap decreases , the change from non - cylindrical to cylindrical occurs at a lower applied force . This eﬀect has been observed in Monte Carlo simulations of driving ﬂuid vesicles through a pore [ 45 ] . To test these notions we study the extension - force curve of tube / cylinder formation for the various models . We do so numerically because V act ( Eq . ( 3 ) ) is a po - tential localized to a particular region of the membrane , which would be diﬃcult to handle analytically . We ﬁrst apply a purely downward force to a ring of vertices right above the Sla1 / Ent1 / 2 attached part of the membrane . We dub this model , Model 0 . The magnitude of the total force is denoted by F t and is distributed uniformly among the vertices . Since κ 1 = 10 k b T and σ = 0 . 18 k B T / nm , F eq ≈ 49 pN ( for the applied point force ) . To numerically determine F eq 0 , the F eq equivalent for Model 0 , we pull on the ring with initially 50 pN of total force , F t , and R ap = 15 nm . We then reinitialize F t to take on smaller values and look for the F t at the boundary between tubes becoming shorter and tubes becoming longer . We ﬁnd that F eq 0 ≈ 25 pN using this algorithm . To study the force barrier , we ﬁnd that deformations for F t < 30 pN are reasonably robust to perturbations ( stepping F t up and back down again ) such that 30 pN is a lower bound for the barrier . See Fig . 5b . We now add a radially inward force component to the force applied to the ring of vertices to address Mod - els 1 and 2 . How does this radially inward modify the shape crossover due to the downward component of the force ? For a purely radially inward force applied to the ring of vertices , the membrane will pucker inward where the force is applied and no cylindrical tube will form . The additional radially inward force increases the force barrier to long tube formation . In Model 1 the actin ﬁlaments are anchored at the bottom of the tube so that the downward component of the force is larger than the radially inward component . We assume that ~ F t = p 2 / 3 F t ~ e z + p 1 / 3 F t ~ e r , which would corre - spond to actin ﬁlaments anchoring at an angle of ap - proximately 35 degrees with respect to the normal of the ﬂat part of the membrane . In Model 2 the radi - ally inward component of the actin polymerization force is larger than the downward component , so we choose ~ F t = p 1 / 3 F t ~ e z + p 2 / 3 F t ~ e r . Fig . 5c depicts the depth - versus - total force curve for both models as well as two membrane conﬁgurations for Model 1 . The tubes are reasonably robust to perturba - tions for all forces studied suggesting that the cross - over to long cylinders is not made . Even though the down - ward component of the force is increased , it is not enough to overcome the increasing force barrier introduced with the increasing radially inward force as well . For large enough radially inward forces , the tube depth begins to decrease resulting in a nonmonotonic depth - versus - total force curve . As the contribution of the radially inward force increases , it is energetically more favorable for the membrane to deform inward as opposed to elongate . Fig . 5d depicts two equilibrium conﬁgurations for Model 1 . For the values of R ap studied , 12 − 18 nm , the tube depth increases only by several percent with increasing R ap . In other words , the applied force clearly plays the dominant role . Now on to Model 2 . All tubes are reasonably ro - bust to force perturbations , just as in Model 1 , and the depth - versus - total force curve is also not monotonic . The largest depth of the membrane deformation for Model 2 is about 65 nm . While there is indeed some room to play with the ratio of the magnitude of the two compo - nents , we contend that Model 1 may better account for the range of observed tube depths [ 2 ] . Hindsight tells us that Model 1 would be more reasonable in obtain - ing longer tubes , but such depths could have been much longer than the observed ones . The nonmonotinicity sug - gests an optimal force of around 100 pN , should long tubes be the optimizing principle . And while Model 2 may not necessarily act as the initial driving force to elon - gate the tube , we address an important role for Model 2 , and one aspect of Proposal 3 , during the ﬁnal stage of endocytosis . C . Pinch - oﬀ stage via the pearling instability Experiments indicate that the BAR proteins enter in this last stage , after the actin ﬁlament network has formed [ 2 , 15 ] . Yet many qualitative depictions of the process show the BAR proteins in between the membrane and the actin ﬁlament network [ 15 ] . BAR proteins have been shown to generate spontaneous curvature in mem - branes [ 25 ] . Since the BAR proteins enter after the tube 8 0 50 100 150 200 F t ( pN ) 0 40 80 120 160 D e p t h ( n m ) Model 0 Model 1 Model 2 ( c ) FIG . 5 : ( a ) Simulation results for Model 1 with total applied force F t = 10 pN .

( b ) Same as ( a ) except with F t = 50 pN ; ( c ) Comparison of the depth as a function of F t for three dif - ferent models . Again , the error bar is of order the symbol size . The arrow pointing downward denotes the value of F eq for reference . has formed [ 2 , 15 ] , there is no need to generate sponta - neous curvature , only sense it . We suggest a potentially new role for BAR proteins here beyond just sensing cur - vature . Once the tubular - like deformation via the actin ﬁlament network occurs , the BAR proteins surround and conﬁne the tube - plus - actin ﬁlament network ( Fig . 2d ) . By conﬁning the actin ﬁlament network , actin polymer - ization stops since polymerization is driven by a ratch - eting eﬀect in spatially ﬂuctuating ﬁlaments [ 46 ] . When actin polymerization stops , no more material can become part of the tube , and the membrane tube area remains constant . Because BAR proteins conﬁne the actin ﬁlament net - work it is now restricted to lie on the membrane . This eﬀect will generate a new contribution to the membrane energy as indicated in Eq . ( 4 ) , where the coordinates of the network are the coordinates of the membrane . The actin ﬁlament network is modeled as an elastic network with spring constant µ [ 26 ] and it contributes to the mem - brane surface tension with the eﬀective membrane surface tension becoming σ eff = σ + µ / 2 , at length scales larger than the meshsize of the actin network . A lower bound of µ ≈ 10 − 2 N / m , or 2 . 5 k B T / nm 2 is given in the litera - ture [ 47 ] . How does this increase in surface tension aﬀect the membrane + actin + BAR - protein system ? We investigate conﬁgurations of a cylindrically shaped membrane with bending rigidity κ and increasing surface tension to an - swer this question . Could such an increase lead to desta - bilization of the cylindrically - shaped membrane ? As the surface tension increases , a sinusoidal perturbation may perhaps lead to the cylindrical membrane breaking up into spherical droplets as surface tension favors spheres . This mechanism is otherwise known as the pearling in - stability [ 48 , 49 ] . Is this instability relevant to the system at hand ? An - alytical analysis of this instability is included in Ap - pendix B to address this question . This analysis sug - gests that the pearling instability may be relevant to the system at hand given the physiological parameters . For the relevant range of wavevectors ( less than 0 . 1 nm − 1 ) , the cylinder is only stable when σR 2 o / κ < 2 . 39 , where R o = 8 . 71 nm , the original radius of the unperturbed cylinder and κ = 10 k B T . The length - to - radius ratio of the initial cylinder is 10 . This inequality , however , de - pends on the strength of the perturbation . To analytically investigate the pearling instability , the volume is assumed to be constant ( see SI ) . This con - straint is imposed so that the membrane does not shrink to a point once the surface tension term dominates . While , indeed , the invagination is an open system so that the volume of the tube may change slightly , as long as the volume remains ﬁnite a pearling instability can set in for some range of parameters . Pearling instabilities have been experimentally observed in open tubes in vivo and in vitro [ 50 , 51 ] . We implement numerical simulations to numerically test for this instability . We start an initial conﬁgura - tion of a triangulated capsule ( as opposed to cylinder ) with the above parameters and then vary σ . As indi - cated in Fig . 6 , the pearling instability mechanism sets in once σR 20 / κ is large enough . In this case , the sur - face tension must increase by an order of magnitude for the instability to set in . This increase by an order of magnitude is precisely the contribution of the E act + BAR term in the energy increasing the surface tension from σ ≃ 0 . 1 k B T / nm 2 to σ ≃ 1 k B T / nm 2 ! Once the membrane breaks up into spheres , the spheres remain connected , as observed in experiments [ 48 , 52 ] . This observation diﬀers from the Rayleigh - Plateau insta - bility , where the spheres do not remain connected . So how does the vesicle nearer to the interior of the cell break oﬀ from the upper part of the tubular membrane ? The most natural answer would be via actin polymer - 9 FIG . 6 : The pearling instability for a cylindrical membrane with increasing surface tension going from left to right , or σR 2 o / κ = 0 . 267 , 2 . 67 , and 4 . 15 respectively . The top and red part of the tube are ﬁxed . ization . Proposals 2 and 3 both provide mechanisms for some downward - directed actin polymerization on the vesicle to drive it further into the cell . In Proposal 2 actin ﬁlaments polymerizing inward from the surround - ing actin cytoskeleton towards the invagination sites can facilitate break - oﬀ of the vesicle by making a comet tail behind it . Such an actin comet tail has indeed been ob - served in experiments [ 10 ] . In Model 3 anchoring regions of actin ﬁlaments to the membrane near the top of the invagination region , while elongation is occuring , could initiate downward actin polymerization . These ﬁlaments can then also drive the break oﬀ of the vesicle nearer to the interior of the cell from the “top” sphere . Both routes may be important for the ﬁnal break - oﬀ of the vesicle . IV . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION We have developed and analyzed a quantitative three - stage model for endocytosis in yeast that is consis - tent with the experimental data [ 12 ] . We ﬁrst built a model for the initial small membrane deformation due to clathrin indirectly binding to the membrane via Sla1 / Ent1 / 2 . We demonstrated that the Sla1 / Ent1 / 2 - bound domain initiates invagination of the membrane by forming a depression , or dimple , to set the radius of the subsequent tubular invagination . This subsequent tubu - lar invagination is driven by actin polymerization forces . We then studied the subseqent tubular invagination in the second elongation stage by modeling the actin poly - merization as an external force applied to the membrane . We found that of the three competing proposals in the lit - erature for the orientation of the actin ﬁlaments in driv - ing tube formation , one proposal ( Proposal 1 ) [ 15 ] was most likely to account for the observed tubular length - scales of the cell membrane in endocytosis in yeast [ 2 ] . Our results predict the applied force that optimizes the length of the tube , where the largest length - to - radius ra - tio is approximately 10 . The combination of this large ratio and the eﬀective surface tension increases due to the presence of BAR proteins conﬁning the actin ﬁla - ment network against the tubular cell membrane ( Fig . 2d ) naturally motivates that the pearling instability may assist in the scission mechanism . We showed that the pearling instability may promote spherical vesicle forma - tion by both analytical calculations and simulations given the physiological parameters involved in endocytosis in yeast . Let us contrast our model with an earlier model for en - docytosis in yeast [ 9 , 15 ] . In the latter , the coordinated eﬀect of protein - induced lipid phase segregation along the tubule plays a key role for vesicle scission . The phase sep - aration between hydrolyzed and non - hydrolyzed PIP 2 , a membrane - bound protein to which actin attaches , in - duces an interfacial line tension in the middle of the de - formation and drives pinch - oﬀ . The eﬀect of actin in this model is to decrease the eﬀective surface tension of the membrane , which makes it easier for the interfacial line tension to scission the membrane . We , however , model the actin as an applied force and are able to generate tube formations as a result . The competing quantita - tive model is not able to generate tubes explicitly given the manner in which actin polymerization is incorporated into the model . We also demonstrate that the pearling instability could potentially facilitate pinch - oﬀ . The fre - quency of endocytosis in budding yeast , invaginating its total cell membrane surface in about 100 minutes [ 2 ] , suggests that an instability , as opposed to coordinated eﬀort involving lipid phase separation , would be useful . The observation that scission occurs at a range of invagi - nation depths also favors an instability as opposed to a more regulated mechanism . While we have presented a quantitative model for en - docytosis in yeast , how much of this story applies to en - docytosis in mammalian cells ? More spherical - like mem - brane deformations are generated in mammalian cells due to clathrin cage formation and the motor protein , dy - namin , driving pinch - oﬀ ? Many of the same proteins involved in yeast clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) are conserved in mammalian CME [ 4 ] . There is also an - other route to endocytosis in mammalian cells via the CLIC / GEEC pathway , which does not require clathrin or dynamin , and forms more tubular deformations as ob - served in yeast [ 53 ] . The requirement for actin in mam - malian CME has been less clear . Several new studies in mammalian cells provide support for an actin require - ment in the invagination and late stages of CME [ 4 ] . On the other hand , a recent in vitro experiment with clathrin and dynamin suggest that these two proteins are suﬃ - cient to drive endocytosis in mammalian cells [ 54 ] . In light of this experiment , it would be interesting to re - visit the modeling of endocytosis in mammalian cells [ 55 ] . It may also be useful to investigate how the modeling presented here can be extended to extocytosis and bud - ding to form a more uniﬁed theoretical framework for cell membrane deformations used to transport material in and out of the cell . 10 V .

Assuming the system is axisymmetric z = z (cid:16)p x 2 + y 2 (cid:17) ≡ z ( r ) , we write the Laplacian in the cylindrical coordinates as ∆ z = 1 r dz dr + d 2 z dr 2 , ( A7 ) where r is the distance from the origin , which we set to coincide with the center of a circular membrane . Additionally , the Gaussian curvature is given by K = 1 r dz dr d 2 z dr 2 .

Next , we ﬁx the area of component 1 ( the Sla1 / Ent1 / 2 attached domain ) to be area A by introducing a Lagrange multiplier and also consider line tension at the interface between the two components / domains , then E init [ z ( r ) ] = X i = 1 , 2 Z R i R i − 1 πκ i r (cid:20) ( ∆ z ) 2 − 4 C 0 i ∆ z + (cid:18) 2 C 20 i + σ i κ i (cid:19) ( ∇ z ) 2 + (cid:18) 4 C 20 i + 2 σ i κ i (cid:19)(cid:21) dr + X i = 1 , 2 Z R i R i − 1 2 πκ G i (cid:18) dz dr d 2 z dr 2 (cid:19) dr + σ 0 2 π Z R 1 0 (cid:18) 1 + 1 2 ( ∇ z 1 ) 2 (cid:19) rdr − A ! + γ 2 πR 1 ( A10 ) We deﬁne z ′ ≡ dzdr , z ′′ ≡ d 2 z dr 2 , ξ 21 = 2 C 201 + σ 1 + σ 0 κ 1 , ξ 22 = 2 C 202 + σ 2 κ 2 such that the Lagrangian for each component becomes L 1 = πκ 1 r " (cid:18) 1 r z 1 ′ + z 1 ′′ (cid:19) 2 − 4 C 01 (cid:18) 1 r z 1 ′ + z 1 ′′ (cid:19) + ξ 21 ( z 1 ′ ) 2 + 2 ξ 21 # + 2 πκ G 1 z 1 ′ z 1 ′′ + 2 πγrδ ( r − R 1 ) L 2 = πκ 2 r " (cid:18) 1 r z 2 ′ + z 2 ′′ (cid:19) 2 − 4 C 02 (cid:18) 1 r z 2 ′ + z 2 ′′ (cid:19) + ξ 22 ( z 2 ′ ) 2 + 2 ξ 22 # + 2 πκ G 2 z 2 ′ z 2 ′′ ( A11 ) We now proceed with the variation of the Lagrangian , or δE init [ z ( r ) ] = δ R R 1 0 L 1 dr + δ R R 2 R 1 L 2 dr .

Appendix B : Pearling instability analysis To understand how the pearling instability comes about as surface tension increases , we model the tubular invagi - nation as a cylinder with a surface of revolution along the z axis given in a parametric form ~ r = ( f ( z ) cos ϕ , f ( z ) sin ϕ , z ) , ( B1 ) where f ( z ) has the form f ( z ) = R (cid:16) 1 + a Rζ ( z ) (cid:17) , ( B2 ) where aR ≪ 1 and | ζ ( z ) | ∼ 1 with the assumption ζ ( 0 ) = ζ ( L ) = 0 . See Fig . 7a . The simplest possible form for ζ is ζ ( z ) = sin ( qz ) . ( B3 ) Moreover , to quantify the energy , the mean curvature of the surface of revolution [ 2 ] is H ( z ) = f ( z ) f ′′ ( z ) − f ′ ( z ) 2 − 1 2 f ( z ) ( f ′ ( z ) 2 + 1 ) 3 / 2 = − 1 − a 2 q 2 cos ( qz ) 2 − aq 2 sin ( qz ) ( R + a sin ( qz ) ) 2 ( 1 + a 2 q 2 cos ( qz ) 2 ) 3 / 2 ( R + a sin ( qz ) ) ( B4 ) In this parameterization , the energy of the cylindrical membrane is given as E = Z dS (cid:0) 2 κH 2 + σ (cid:1) = Z dϕdzf ( z ) (cid:16) 1 + f ′ ( z ) 2 (cid:17) 1 / 2 (cid:0) 2 κH 2 + σ (cid:1) . ( B5 ) This expands to E = Z dϕdzR (cid:16) 1 + a R ζ ( z ) (cid:17) (cid:16) 1 + a 2 ζ ′ ( z ) 2 (cid:17) 1 / 2 (cid:0) 2 κH 2 + σ (cid:1) = Z L 0 2 π p 1 + a 2 q 2 cos ( qz ) 2 ( R + a sin ( qz ) ) (cid:0) σ + κ (cid:0) 1 + a 2 q 2 cos ( qz ) 2 + aq 2 sin ( qz ) ( R + a sin ( qz ) ) (cid:1) 2 2 ( 1 + a 2 q 2 cos ( qz ) 2 ) 3 ( R + a sin ( qz ) ) 2 (cid:1) dz . ( B6 ) 15 We will now impose a volume constraint as with all minimal surface problems , otherwise , once the surface tension term dominates , no surface will be the lowest energy solution . This volume constaint is given by V = Z L 0 π ( R + a sin ( qz ) ) 2 dz = πR 2 o L , ( B7 ) where R o is the original cylinder’s radius . Using this constraint , we can solve for R and then compare the energies of the original unperturbed cylinder with the perturbed cylinder , where the former energy , E 0 , is given by E 0 = E ( a = 0 ) = Z L 0 2 πR o (cid:18) κ 2 R 2 o + σ (cid:19) dz = 2 πR o L (cid:18) κ 2 R 2 o + σ (cid:19) . ( B8 ) Using Mathematica [ 3 ] , we ﬁnd that when κ = 10 k B T , σ = 0 . 32 k B T / nm 2 , R o = 8 . 71 nm , L = 87 . 1 nm —all relevant parameters for the problem at hand—and a = 0 . 16 nm , the energy diﬀerence ∆ E = E pert − E 0 becomes negative near q ≈ 0 . 06 nm − 1 ( See Fig . 7b ) . For a cylinder of order 100 nm , this instability can lead to pinch - oﬀ . We must point out that for σR 2 o / κ > 1 . 6 , there is an instability at much smaller q , or much longer cylinders [ 4 ] , such that this instability would not be relevant for endocytosis in yeast . For the relevant range of wavevectors , for σR 2 o / κ < 2 . 39 , the smooth cylinder is stable . Therefore , the ratio σR 2 o / κ needs to be large enough for the pearling instability to set in for endocytosis in yeast since surface tension favors spheres as opposed to cylinders . In other words , once the surface tension becomes large enough , the pearling instability sets in . f ( z ) z L 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 . 05 0 . 06 0 . 07 q H nm - 1 L - 0 . 2 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 D E H k B T L FIG . 7 : Left : Schematic denoting notation used .
