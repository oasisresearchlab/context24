( a ) Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for R gives R = (cid:96)n ( π ) π − 1 . ( b ) From the transmission threshold result , π = 1 when R < 1 . For π < 1 , insert the values 0 . 01 , 0 . 02 , 0 . 03 , . . . , 0 . 99 for π into one column of a spreadsheet and use R = (cid:96)n ( π ) π − 1 to compute the corresponding values of R in a second column . Then the graphics of the spreadsheet can be used to plot values of π against values of R . 4 . As the selection for vaccination in the two campaigns is independent , the fraction of individuals susceptible following the second campaign is ( 1 − v ) 2 . Therefore , after the second campaign the mean number infected by an early infective is R ∗ = ( 1 − v ) 2 R . This is less than 1 when v > 1 − 1 / √ R = 1 − 1 / √ 5 = 0 . 5528 . Therefore , the smallest value of v that prevents epidemics with this two - dose strategy is 0 . 553 . 6 . R (cid:48) > 1 may be used in the statement of the transmission threshold property , because ( i ) R (cid:48) > 1 implies R > 1 , and ( ii ) R (cid:48) < 1 implies R < 1 . 8 . ( a ) When R = 5 and R ∗ = 0 . 8 we ﬁnd ( i ) ν 1 = 1 1 − R ∗ = 1 1 − 0 . 8 = 5 . ( ii ) Suppose the primary infective infects X individuals , each initiating a minor outbreak of mean size 1 / ( 1 − R ∗ ) . Since the mean of X is 5 , we obtain ν 2 = 1 + 5 1 − 0 . 8 = 26 . ( ii ) Arguing similarly we ﬁnd ν 4 = 1 + 5 + 25 + 1251 − 0 . 8 = 656 . ( b ) Delay has a dramatic eﬀect on the mean size of the outbreak . This stems from the fact that reproduction is a multiplicative process . 10 . By analogy with the ﬁrst equation on Book Page 18 , we ﬁnd π (cid:48) = 1 1 + 2 f − 2 fπ where , by Book Equation ( 2 . 11 ) , π = 1 / R = 12 . This gives π (cid:48) = 1 1 + f . Its graph is shown in Figure 1 . pi’ . 5 . 6 . 7 . 8 . 9 1 0 . 2 . 4 . 6 . 8 1 f Figure 1 : Graph of π (cid:48) against f . 1 Let’s spell this solution out in greater detail : π (cid:48) , the probability of a minor outbreak , is given by π (cid:48) = p (cid:48) 0 + p (cid:48) 1 π + p (cid:48) 2 π 2 + p (cid:48) 3 π 3 + · · · , ( 1 ) where π is the probability of a minor outbreak when the primary infective spends all of his infectious period back in his community . That is , π = p 0 + p 1 π + p 2 π 2 + p 3 π 3 + · · · . ( 2 ) Here p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , . . . are the probabilities of a Geometric distribution with mean 2 , while p (cid:48) 0 , p (cid:48) 1 , p (cid:48) 2 , . . . are the probabilities of a Geometric distribution with mean 2 f . That is , p j = 1 1 + R (cid:16) R 1 + R (cid:17) j = 13 (cid:0) 23 (cid:1) j and p (cid:48) j = 1 1 + 2 f (cid:16) 2 f 1 + 2 f (cid:17) j We need the geometric series equation 1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + · · · = 11 − x , which holds when 0 < x < 1 . With x = 23 π in Equation ( 2 ) the geometric series equation gives π = 1 3 − 2 π . Solve this to get π = 12 . With x = 2 fπ 1 + 2 f = f 1 + 2 f in Equation ( 1 ) the geometric series equation gives π (cid:48) = 1 1 + f . 12 . Assume that R < 1 and let X (cid:48) = the number of oﬀspring resulting from direct contacts with the primary infective , Y (cid:48) = the total outbreak size , and Y = total outbreak size when the primary infective spends his entire infectious period in the community . Conditionally , given X (cid:48) = x , the size of the outbreak Y (cid:48) may be written Y (cid:48) = (cid:40) 1 , if x = 0 , 1 + Y 1 + · · · + Y x , if x > 0 , ( 1 ) where Y 1 , Y 2 , . . . , Y x are independent random variables with the same distribution as Y . Using ( 1 ) we ﬁnd E ( Y (cid:48) | X (cid:48) = x ) = (cid:40) 1 , if x = 0 , 1 + E ( Y 1 ) + E ( Y 2 ) + · · · + E ( Y x ) , if x > 0 , = 1 + x E ( Y ) . Therefore , provided R < 1 , E ( Y (cid:48) ) = E [ E ( Y (cid:48) | X (cid:48) ) ] = E [ 1 + X (cid:48) E ( Y ) ] = 1 + E ( X (cid:48) ) E ( Y ) , where E ( Y ) = 1 / ( 1 − R ) and E ( X (cid:48) ) = R (cid:48) , because the primary infective spends only part of his infectious period in the community . That is E ( Y (cid:48) ) = 1 + R (cid:48) / ( 1 − R ) , as in Book Equation ( 2 . 12 ) . Chapter 3 2 . ( a ) ( i ) The immunization campaign changes the mean number an early infective infects outside his household from µ to µ ∗ = 23 µ . ( ii ) Using the Binomial distribution , the H households with 2 susceptibles prior to the campaign become 19 H households with no susceptibles , 49 H households with 1 susceptible and 49 H households with 2 susceptibles . The H households with 1 susceptible prior to the campaign become 13 H households with no susceptibles and 2 3 H households with 1 susceptible . As a consequence , post - campaign there are 109 H households with one susceptible and 49 H households with 2 susceptibles . Using Book Equation ( 3 . 3 ) , on page 40 , we ﬁnd ν ∗ H = 109 H + 2 × 49 Hν 2 109 H + 2 × 49 H = ( 5 + 4 ν 2 ) / 9 . ( iii ) R ∗ H = µ ∗ ν ∗ H = 23 µ × [ ( 5 + 4 ν 2 ) / 9 ] = 2 µ ( 5 + 4 ν 2 ) / 27 2 ( b ) The solid curve in Figure 2 shows the graph of the ratio R ∗ H R H = 2 µ ( 5 + 4 ν 2 ) / 27 µ ( 1 + 2 ν 2 ) / 3 = 2 9 5 + 4 ν 2 1 + 2 ν 2 = 2 9 (cid:18) 2 + 3 1 + 2 ν 2 (cid:19) against ν 2 .

Dashed curve : Corresponding graph for Strategy B , as in Book Figure 3 . 2 . By comparing this graph with the graphs of Book Figure 3 . 2 we see that randomly selecting individuals for vaccination reduces R H more than Strategy A , almost as much as Strategy B , but substantially less that Strategy C . 4 . For a community in which individuals mix uniformly , Book Equation ( 2 . 5 ) gives ν = 1 / ( 1 − R ) . In Section 2 . 7 . 2 we substituted ν by y , the mean of observed outbreak sizes , and used the equation to obtain an estimate of R . With a household outbreak as the unit that transmits the infection the corresponding estimating equation is m H = 1 / ( 1 − R H ) , where m H is the mean of the number of infected household in observed outbreaks . Solving this equation for R H gives the estimate of Book Equation ( 3 . 6 ) . Chapter 4 2 . ( a ) Pr ( Type 1 primary infective infects at least one Type 2 individual ) = 0 . 2 + 0 . 1 + 0 . 1 = 0 . 4 . ( b ) µ 12 = 0 × 0 . 6 + 1 × 0 . 3 + 2 × 0 . 1 = 0 . 5 . ( c ) Compute µ 11 , µ 21 and µ 22 similarly , to get mean matrix (cid:18) µ 11 µ 12 µ 21 µ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 1 . 3 (cid:19) . Therefore R T = 1 2 (cid:16) µ 11 + µ 22 + (cid:112) ( µ 11 − µ 22 ) 2 + 4 µ 12 µ 21 (cid:17) = 1 2 (cid:16) 0 . 3 + 1 . 3 + (cid:112) ( 0 . 3 − 1 . 3 ) 2 + 0 (cid:17) = 1 . 3 . ( d ) The equation x 2 = (cid:80) i (cid:80) j p 2 ( i , j ) x i 1 x j 2 = 0 . 2 + 0 . 3 x 2 + 0 . 5 x 2 2 can be written x 22 − 1 . 4 x 2 + 0 . 4 = ( x 2 − 1 ) ( x 2 − 0 . 4 ) = 0 . π 2 is the smaller root of this equation . Therefore π 2 = 0 . 4 . ( e ) Substitute π 2 = 0 . 4 into equation π 1 = (cid:80) i (cid:80) j p 1 ( i , j ) π i 1 π j 2 = 0 . 4 + 0 . 2 π 1 + 0 . 2 π 2 + 0 . 1 π 1 π 2 + 0 . 1 π 22 to get π 1 = 0 . 496 + 0 . 24 π 1 . Therefore π 1 = 0 . 6526 . 3 ( f ) When a fraction v 2 of the initial Type 2 susceptibles is vaccinated , with a vaccine that provides full protection , the mean matrix becomes (cid:18) µ ∗ 11 µ ∗ 12 µ ∗ 21 µ 22 ∗ (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 3 0 . 5 ( 1 − v 2 ) 0 1 . 3 ( 1 − v 2 ) (cid:19) . The post - campaign reproduction number is R ∗ T = 1 2 (cid:18) µ ∗ 11 + µ ∗ 22 + (cid:113) ( µ ∗ 11 − µ ∗ 22 ) 2 + 4 µ ∗ 12 µ ∗ 21 (cid:19) = 1 2 (cid:16) 0 . 3 + 1 . 3 ( 1 − v 2 ) + (cid:112) [ 0 . 3 − 1 . 3 ( 1 − v 2 ) ] 2 + 0 (cid:17) ( A graph of this helps ! ) = (cid:40) 0 . 3 , when v 2 ≥ 1013 , 1 . 3 ( 1 − v 2 ) , when v 2 < 1013 . We deduce that R ∗ T is below 1 when the fraction of Type 2 susceptibles immunized is greater than 3 / 13 . 4 . ( a ) Substituting µ 11 = µ 21 = µ 1 and µ 12 = µ 22 = µ 2 gives R T = 12 (cid:16) µ 1 + µ 2 + (cid:112) ( µ 1 − µ 2 ) 2 + 4 µ 2 µ 1 (cid:17) = µ 1 + µ 2 . ( b ) As µ 11 + µ 12 = µ 1 + µ 2 and µ 21 + µ 22 = µ 1 + µ 2 , the mean of the total number infected by an infective is the same for the two types . Therefore infectives are ‘homogeneous’ , in the sense assumed in Chapter 2 , and the reproduction number is µ 1 + µ 2 , the common mean number infected . Note , however , that Type 1 and Type 2 individuals may diﬀer in other disease characteristics . For example , Type 1 infectives might be more infectious , but for a shorter period of time . Chapter 5 2 . ( a ) Pr ( B and C avoid being infected by A ) = Pr ( B avoids infection by A ) × Pr ( C avoids infection by A ) = exp ( − 1 . 5 ) × exp ( − 1 . 5 / 4 ) = 0 . 223 × 0 . 687 = 0 . 153 . ( b ) Pr ( C is infected by A , but B is not ) = Pr ( C is infected by A ) × Pr ( B avoids infection by A ) = ( 1 − 0 . 687 ) × 0 . 223 = 0 . 07 . 4 . ( a ) Equating the total area under the graph of ω ( u ) to 1 gives c = 0 . 25 . ( b ) The probability that a primary household infective infects his susceptible household partner is 1 − exp (cid:2) − total area under the graph of ω ( u ) (cid:3) = 1 − e − 1 = 0 . 632 . ( c ) R H = µν H , where µ = total area under the graph of 2 ω ( u ) and ν H = 1 + Pr ( primary household infective infects his household partner ) . Therefore R H = µν H = 2 × ( 1 + 0 . 632 ) = 3 . 26 . ( d ) When 1 < u ∗ < 5 , isolating each infective u ∗ time units after their infection changes µ to µ ∗ = 12 ( u ∗ − 1 ) and ν H to ν ∗ H = 2 − exp [ − ( u ∗ − 1 ) / 4 ] . Therefore we want u ∗ such that u ∗ − 1 2 (cid:20) 2 − exp (cid:18) − u ∗ − 1 4 (cid:19) (cid:21) = 1 Numerical solution , e . g . using a spreadsheet , gives u ∗ = 2 . 52 days . 4 6 . ( a ) The initial mean matrix is (cid:18) µ AA µ AC µ CA µ CC (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 8 × 1 0 . 2 × 1 . 5 0 . 8 × 2 0 . 2 × 3 . 0 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 8 0 . 3 1 . 6 0 . 6 (cid:19) . ( b ) The initial reproduction number is R T = 12 (cid:16) 0 . 8 + 0 . 6 + (cid:112) ( 0 . 8 − 0 . 6 ) 2 + 4 × 0 . 3 × 1 . 6 (cid:17) = 1 . 4 . ( c ) Suppose onset of symptoms occurs in a child s time units after its infection . Then , isolating infected children at onset of symptoms changes the initial mean matrix to (cid:18) µ ∗ AA µ ∗ AC µ ∗ CA µ ∗ CC (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 8 0 . 3 1 . 6 Ω C ( s ) 0 . 6 Ω C ( s ) (cid:19) , where Ω C ( s ) is the area under infectivity proﬁle ω C ( u ) from u = 0 to u = s . Under this control measure the reproduction number R ∗ T becomes 12 (cid:0) µ ∗ AA + µ ∗ CC + (cid:112) ( µ ∗ AA − µ ∗ CC ) 2 + 4 µ ∗ AC µ ∗ CA (cid:1) = 12 (cid:16) 0 . 8 + 0 . 6 Ω C ( s ) + (cid:112) [ 0 . 8 − 0 . 6 Ω C ( s ) ] 2 + 4 × 0 . 3 × 1 . 6 Ω C ( s ) (cid:17) = 0 . 8 + 0 . 6 Ω C ( s ) . As R ∗ T = 1 implies Ω C ( s ) = 13 , we need s = ‘duration from infection until onset of symptoms’ small enough so that Ω C ( s ) ≤ 13 is satisﬁed . ( d ) Adults cannot infect anyone if all infected adults are isolated prior to becoming infectious . The mean matrix corresponding to this scenario is (cid:18) 0 0 1 . 6 0 . 6 (cid:19) , which leads to reproduction number R ∗ T = 12 (cid:16) 0 + 0 . 6 + (cid:112) ( 0 − 0 . 6 ) 2 + 4 × 0 × 1 . 6 (cid:17) = 0 . 6 . As this is less than 1 , it is indeed possible to prevent epidemics by very early isolation of most infected adults . 8 . ( a ) The solution to Book Equation ( 5 . 8 ) is x ( u ) = x ( 0 ) exp (cid:2) λu − (cid:82) u 0 ϕ ( w ) d w (cid:3) . With ϕ ( u ) = (cid:40) 0 , for 0 ≤ u ≤ τ , α ( u − τ ) γ , for u > τ , this becomes x ( u ) =   x ( 0 ) exp ( λu ) , for 0 ≤ u ≤ τ , x ( 0 ) exp (cid:104) λu − αγ + 1 ( u − τ ) γ + 1 (cid:105) , for u > τ . ( b ) Figure 3 shows two curves from this family . ( i ) Solid curve : τ = 2 , λ = 2 , α = 2 . 0 and γ = 0 . 3 , ( ii ) Dashed curve : τ = 2 , λ = 2 , α = 0 . 2 and γ = 2 . 0 . The curves are scaled so that the area under the curve is 1 . 0 . 2 . 4 0 2 4 6 8 time Figure 3 : Infectivity proﬁles based on a model for the pathogen population size . 5 Chapter 6 2 . ( a ) With full vaccination coverage , Vaccines 1 , 2 and 3 achieve post - campaign eﬀective reproduction numbers of 0 . 5 , 0 . 42 and 0 . 18 , respectively ( using R 1 = abR 0 ) . In this case Vaccine 3 achieves the lowest post - campaign eﬀective reproduction number . ( b ) With achievable coverage v the post - campaign eﬀective reproduction number becomes R v = [ 1 − ( 1 − ab ) v ] R 0 . With v values of 0 . 7 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 3 for Vaccines 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively , the post - campaign eﬀective reproduction numbers are 0 . 95 , 1 . 21 and 1 . 454 . Vaccine 1 should be adopted for an immunization campaign . 4 . Let fully susceptibles be Type 1 individuals and successfully vaccinated individuals be Type 2 . Type 1 individuals include vaccinees whose vaccination failed . With vaccination coverage v , the fraction of community members that are Type 1 is 1 − ( 1 − f ) v and a fraction ( 1 − f ) v are Type 2 . ( a ) Post - campaign , the type - speciﬁc mean number of oﬀspring for the two types is (cid:18) µ 11 µ 12 µ 21 µ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) [ 1 − ( 1 − f ) v ] R 0 a ( 1 − f ) vR 0 b [ 1 − ( 1 − f ) v ] R 0 ab ( 1 − f ) vR 0 (cid:19) . This gives the post - campaign reproduction number as R ∗ T = (cid:2) 1 − ( 1 − ab ) ( 1 − f ) v (cid:3) R 0 . ( b ) The campaign is able to prevent epidemics provided the reproduction number R ∗ T is below 1 when vaccination coverage is 100 % . That is , provided ( 1 − ab ) ( 1 − f ) > 1 − 1 / R 0 . When the values of a , b and f satisfy this condition , we solve the equation R ∗ T = 1 for v to obtain the critical vaccination coverage v † = 1 − 1 / R 0 ( 1 − ab ) ( 1 − f ) . Chapter 7 2 . ( a ) Let non - responders and responders be Type 1 and Type 2 , respectively . Using Book Equation ( 7 . 1 ) , the post - intervention mean matrix is (cid:18) µ ∗ 11 µ ∗ 12 µ ∗ 21 µ ∗ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 6 × R 0 0 . 5 × 0 . 4 × R 0 0 . 5 × 0 . 6 × R 0 0 . 5 2 × 0 . 4 × R 0 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 6 R 0 0 . 2 R 0 0 . 3 R 0 0 . 1 R 0 (cid:19) . For this mean matrix , Book Equation ( 4 . 2 ) gives the reproduction number 0 . 7 R 0 . This is less than 1 provided R 0 < 1 / 0 . 7 = 1 . 43 . ( b ) Let Type 1 be individuals who adjust their mixing by a small amount and Type 2 be those who reduce their mixing substantially . Post - intervention the mean matrix is (cid:18) 0 . 8 2 × 0 . 7 × R 0 0 . 8 × 0 . 2 × 0 . 3 × R 0 0 . 8 × 0 . 2 × 0 . 7 × R 0 0 . 2 2 × 0 . 3 × R 0 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 448 R 0 0 . 048 R 0 0 . 112 R 0 0 . 012 R 0 (cid:19) . For this mean matrix , Book Equation ( 4 . 2 ) gives the reproduction number 0 . 46 R 0 . This is less than 1 provided R 0 < 1 / 0 . 46 = 2 . 17 . 4 . When a fraction of community members change their mixing rate we have two types of individual , non - responder ( Type 1 ) and responder ( Type 2 ) . 6 ( a ) The type - speciﬁc mean number of primary household cases generated by the two types of infective is described by (cid:18) µ ∗ 11 µ ∗ 12 µ ∗ 21 µ ∗ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 5 µ 0 . 5 aµ 0 . 5 aµ 0 . 5 a 2 µ (cid:19) . The mixing by non - responders and responders within households is identical . As both members of each household are of the same type we have (cid:18) ν ∗ 11 ν ∗ 12 ν ∗ 21 ν ∗ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) ν H 0 0 ν H (cid:19) . Therefore (cid:18) m ∗ 11 m ∗ 12 m ∗ 21 m ∗ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 5 µν H 0 . 5 aµν H 0 . 5 aµν H 0 . 5 a 2 µν H (cid:19) and R ∗ HA = 12 ( 1 + a 2 ) R H0 . When R H0 = 1 . 6 , an epidemic is prevented when 12 ( 1 + a 2 ) × 1 . 6 < 1 , i . e . a < 0 . 5 . ( b ) The type - speciﬁc mean number of primary household cases generated is again (cid:18) µ ∗ 11 µ ∗ 12 µ ∗ 21 µ ∗ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 5 µ 0 . 5 aµ 0 . 5 aµ 0 . 5 a 2 µ (cid:19) . However , when every household has one individual of each type , we have (cid:18) ν ∗ 11 ν ∗ 12 ν ∗ 21 ν ∗ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 1 ν H − 1 ν H − 1 1 (cid:19) , giving (cid:18) m ∗ 11 m ∗ 12 m ∗ 21 m ∗ 22 (cid:19) = 1 2 µ (cid:18) ˜ a + aν H ν H − ˜ a a ˜ a + a 2 ν H aν H − a ˜ a (cid:19) . Therefore R ∗ HB = 12 ˜ a 2 µ + aµν H . ( c ) With a = 0 . 6 and ν H = 1 . 9 we ﬁnd R ∗ HA = 12 ( 1 + a 2 ) µν H = 1 . 292 µ and R ∗ HB = 12 ˜ a 2 µ + aµν H = 1 . 22 µ . Hence R ∗ HA > R ∗ HB when a = 0 . 6 and ν H = 1 . 9 . ( d ) R ∗ HA ≥ R ∗ HB when 12 ( 1 + a 2 ) µν H ≥ 12 ˜ a 2 µ + aµν H . This requires ( 1 + a 2 ) ν H − ( 1 − a ) 2 − 2 aν H = ( 1 − a ) 2 ( ν H − 1 ) ≥ 0 . This is always true and hence R ∗ HA > R ∗ HB is always true . Chapter 8 2 . ( a ) The community attack rate y satisﬁes 0 . 4 − y = 0 . 4 exp ( − 6 . 4 y ) . Numerically , its solution is found to be y = 0 . 360 . ( b ) The initial reproduction number is R = s 0 R 0 = 0 . 4 × 6 . 4 = 2 . 56 . ( i ) Need community coverage v such that ( 1 − v ) R = 1 , giving v = 1 − 12 . 56 = 0 . 609 . ( ii ) When we target susceptibles , the fraction of community members we need to vaccinate to prevent epidemics is v S , given by ( s 0 − v S ) R 0 = 1 . This leads to v S = s 0 − 1 / R 0 = 0 . 4 − 1 / 6 . 4 = 0 . 244 . ( c ) ( i ) Cost incurred by an epidemic is 100 × 0 . 360 × 825 , 000 (cid:39) $ 30m . ( ii ) Indiscriminate vaccination : Cost = 100 × 0 . 609 × 625 , 000 (cid:39) $ 38m . ( iii ) Vaccinating susceptibles : Cost = 6 , 750 , 000 + 100 × 0 . 244 × 625 , 000 (cid:39) $ 22m . ( d ) It depends on the risk of an epidemic . If an epidemic is likely , the cheapest option is to determine who is susceptible and vaccinating only susceptibles . 4 . ( a ) The proportion of cases among unvaccinated individuals equals the proportion of cases among individuals vaccinated with an inactive vaccine . Therefore 0 . 8 × 0 . 12 0 . 15 = 0 . 2 × 0 . 12 0 . 85 f , which gives estimate ˆ f = 0 . 2 × 0 . 15 0 . 8 × 0 . 85 = 0 . 044 . That is , 4 . 4 % of vaccinations are estimated to fail . 7 ( b ) The initial fraction of individuals that are susceptible is s 0 = 0 . 15 + 0 . 85 f = 0 . 1875 . With this value of s 0 the ﬁnal - size equation becomes 0 . 1875 − 0 . 12 = 0 . 1875 exp ( − 0 . 12 R 0 ) and we obtain the estimate (cid:98) R 0 = 8 . 51 . ( c ) Initial R is estimated by ˆ s 0 (cid:98) R 0 = 0 . 1875 × 8 . 51 = 1 . 60 . ( d ) Final R is estimated by ( ˆ s 0 − 0 . 12 ) (cid:98) R 0 = ( 0 . 1875 − 0 . 12 ) × 8 . 51 = 0 . 57 . 6 . ( a ) With parameter values α = 1 , β = 4 , s 01 = 0 . 8 and s 02 = 0 . 2 , Book Equations ( 8 . 3 ) become 1 − y S1 = exp ( − 0 . 8 y S1 − 0 . 2 y S2 ) and 1 − y S2 = exp ( − 0 . 8 y S1 − y S2 ) . The ﬁrst equation gives y S2 = − 0 . 8 y S1 + ln ( 1 − y S1 ) 0 . 2 . In a spreadsheet , we can use this equation to ﬁnd the values of y S2 corresponding to a column of y S1 values . Substituting the pairs of ( y S1 , y S2 ) values from this spreadsheet into the second equation allows us to ﬁnd its solution . This numerical solution gives y S1 = 0 . 283 , y S2 = 0 . 531 and y = 0 . 8 y S1 + 0 . 2 y S2 = 0 . 333 . The type - speciﬁc reproduction number is obtained from the type - speciﬁc mean number of oﬀ - spring , given by (cid:18) µ 11 µ 12 µ 21 µ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 8 0 . 2 0 . 8 1 (cid:19) . With these means , Equation ( 4 . 2 ) gives R T = 1 2 (cid:16) 0 . 8 + 1 + (cid:112) ( 0 . 8 − 1 ) 2 + 4 × 0 . 2 × 0 . 8 (cid:17) = 1 . 312 . ( b ) For parameter values α = 1 and β = 0 equations for the type - speciﬁc attack rates become 1 − y S1 = exp ( − 0 . 8 y S1 − 0 . 2 y S2 ) and 1 − y S2 = exp ( − 0 . 8 y S1 − 0 . 2 y S2 ) . We deduce that y S1 = y S2 and the common value satisﬁes 1 − x = exp ( − x ) . The only value satisfying this equation is x = 0 . Hence y S1 = y S2 = y = 0 . In other words , there is no epidemic . The type - speciﬁc reproduction number is obtained from the type - speciﬁc mean number of oﬀ - spring , given by (cid:18) µ 11 µ 12 µ 21 µ 22 (cid:19) = (cid:18) 0 . 8 0 . 2 0 . 8 0 . 2 (cid:19) . With these means , Book Equation ( 4 . 2 ) gives R T = 1 . Comment : For these parameter values , a total ban on mass - gathering events is able to prevent an epidemic . Of course , in practice there would be considerable resistance to a total ban from those with vested interest in mass - gathering events . Chapter 9 2 . ( a ) ( i ) From Book Equation ( 8 . 1 ) , in the form 1 − y = exp ( − 1 . 6 y ) , we ﬁnd the ﬁnal attack rate y = 0 . 642 . We predict that about 642 individuals will be infected . ( ii ) Compute an epidemic curve in generation time , as in Section 9 . 1 . 2 , using a generation time of 2 . 5 days . A peak generation incidence of 82 . 23 is found . Therefore , we predict that the peak daily incidence attained is about 82 . 23 / 2 . 5 (cid:39) 33 . ( iii ) Let Generation 1 consist of the initial infective and calendar time t = 0 correspond to his ‘mid - infectious period’ . The computed epidemic curve shows a peak for Generation 13 , which corresponds to calendar time t = 12 × 2 . 5 = 30 . We predict that peak incidence occurs about 30 days after the mid - infectious period of the initial infective . ( iv ) Expect the daily incidence to be above 10 when the generation size is above 25 . This occurs for 9 generations , which corresponds to about 22 to 23 days . ( b ) Now the initial number of susceptibles is 800 . 8 ( i ) From Book Equation ( 8 . 1 ) , in the form 0 . 8 − y = 0 . 8 exp ( − 1 . 6 y ) , we ﬁnd ﬁnal attack rate y = 0 . 322 and so predict that about 322 individuals will be infected . ( ii ) Peak daily incidence attained is about 21 . 66 / 2 . 5 (cid:39) 9 . ( iii ) Peak incidence predicted to be on day 42 or 43 . ( iv ) Expect the daily incidence to be above 10 when the generation size is above 25 . It is predicted that this will not happen . ( c ) − Immunizating only 20 % of susceptibles roughly halves the total number of cases . − The number of cases prevented exceeds the number of individuals immunized . − The reduction of the peak of daily incidence , from 33 to 9 , lowers the burden on resources at the peak time substantially . − This immunization delays the time of the peak of the epidemic substantially , which helps by providing more time to prepare for the period when demand on medical facilities will be highest . However , it does mean that the epidemic may linger longer . − The immunization reduces the period of high demand on resources substantially , e . g . the time period during which there are more than 10 cases per day . 4 . ( a ) The probability distribution of a sample mean is approximately Normal when the sample size is moderate to large , which we assume . This Normal approximation gives the 95 % conﬁdence interval ( 6 . 9 − 1 . 96 × 0 . 2 , 6 . 9 + 1 . 96 × 0 . 2 ) = ( 6 . 508 , 7 . 292 ) for the population mean age at infection . Using this in Book Figure 9 . 9 , as shown in Figure 4 , leads to the 95 % conﬁdence interval ( 8 . 71 , 9 . 57 ) for R 0 . 5 10 15 20 R 2 4 6 8 10 age 6 . 5 7 . 3 0 9 . 57 8 . 71 Figure 4 : Using a CI for the mean age at infection to construct a CI for R 0 . ( b ) With a mean age at infection of 16 . 9 , a similar approach leads to 95 % conﬁdence interval ( 16 . 9 − 1 . 96 × 0 . 2 , 16 . 9 + 1 . 96 × 0 . 2 ) = ( 16 . 508 , 17 . 292 ) for the mean age at infection parameter . The graph of R 0 versus ‘mean age at infection’ now leads to the 95 % conﬁdence interval ( 4 . 14 , 4 . 31 ) for R 0 . ( c ) The two conﬁdence intervals diﬀer in two obvious ways . First , a larger ‘mean age at infection’ leads to a smaller estimate of R 0 , as expected by inspecting Book Figure 9 . 9 . Second , the larger ‘mean age at infection’ led to a narrower conﬁdence interval . This might also be expected from Book Figure 9 . 9 . (cid:2) Note , however , that the width of the conﬁdence intervals diﬀer , in part , because the standard error of the sample mean in ( a ) and ( b ) was the same . It is far from clear that this happens in practice . (cid:3) 6 . ( a ) Suppose in Generation r there are I r infectives of Type 1 and J r infectives of Type 2 . The number of susceptibles exposed to these Generation r infectives is S r for Type 1 and W r for Type 2 . 9 From the given data I 1 = 0 , J 1 = 1 , S 1 = 1200 , W 1 = 800 and Mean number of suceptibles infected Type 1 Type 2 Type 1 Infective 12002000 β 11 = 0 . 6 8002000 β 12 = 0 . 8 Type 2 Infective 12002000 β 21 = 1 . 2 8002000 β 22 = 2 . 0 This gives β 11 = 1 , β 12 = 2 , β 21 = 2 and β 22 = 5 . Generation sizes are computed iteratively using I r + 1 = S r (cid:2) 1 − exp ( − I r / 2000 − 2 J r / 2000 ) (cid:3) and S r + 1 = S r − I r + 1 for Type 1 , J r + 1 = W r (cid:2) 1 − exp ( − 2 I r / 2000 − 5 J r / 2000 ) (cid:3) and W r + 1 = W r − J r + 1 for Type 2 . These computations lead to the three epidemic curves in Figure 5 , where ‘day’ is the number of days following the median of the primary infective’s infectivity proﬁle . ( A generation is taken as 4 days . ) All infectives Type 1 infectives Type 2 infectives 0 100 200 300 400 0 20 40 60 day GenSize Figure 5 . Epidemic curve for Type 1 , Type 2 and ‘All’ infectives with no immunization . Vertical axis gives the number of infectives in generations 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , 15 . The horizontal axis has been stretched to reﬂect calendar time . ( b ) Figure 6 shows the epidemic curves when there are 600 prior Type 1 vaccinations .

Six hundred Type 1 vaccinations ( i ) reduce the maximum number of infections in a single generation from 380 to 234 , ( ii ) change the time to reach peak incidence minimally . 10 ( c ) Six hundred Type 2 vaccinations reduce R , the initial reproduction number , to 1 . 04 . A deter - ministic model can only provide rough guidance when R is so close to 1 , because chance plays a signiﬁcant role in such outbreaks . A clear picture requires a simulation study . ( i ) The deterministic model predicts a maximum number of infectives in a single generation of about 2 or 3 . ( ii ) The time of peak incidence is subject to considerable chance variation . Occasionally such outbreaks linger for a long time . ( d ) Targeting Type 2 individuals for vaccination is a far more eﬀective way to mitigate the impact of an outbreak . Note : To predict the day when the maximum incidence occurs requires more information on the form of the infectivity proﬁle . Chapter 10 2 .

We test for the independence of two classiﬁcations of a contingency table . This is a large - sample test , so the expected frequency in each cell should be at least ﬁve . To ensure this we pool household outbreaks of size four and ﬁve , giving the frequencies shown below . Frequency Outbreak size Overcrowded Crowded Uncrowded Total 1 112 ( 115 . 3 ) 155 ( 153 . 5 ) 156 ( 154 . 2 ) 423 2 35 ( 35 . 7 ) 41 ( 47 . 5 ) 55 ( 47 . 7 ) 131 3 17 ( 16 . 4 ) 24 ( 21 . 8 ) 19 ( 21 . 9 ) 60 4 & 5 17 ( 13 . 6 ) 21 ( 18 . 1 ) 12 ( 18 . 2 ) 50 Total 181 241 242 664 The corresponding ‘expected’ frequencies , ﬁtted under the assumption that the classiﬁcations ‘out - break size’ and ‘level of crowding’ are independent , are shown in brackets . The ﬁtted frequency corresponding to the observed frequency of a given cell is computed by ( sum of observed frequencies for its row ) × ( sum of observed frequencies for its column ) 664 . The value of the goodness - of - ﬁt statistic is ( 112 − 115 . 3 ) 2 115 . 3 + ( 155 − 153 . 5 ) 2 153 . 5 + · · · + ( 12 − 18 . 2 ) 2 18 . 2 = 6 . 18 . This is less than 10 . 64 , the 90 th percentile of the χ 2 − distribution , with ( 4 − 1 ) × ( 3 − 1 ) = 6 degrees of freedom . Therefore we accepts the independence of the two classiﬁcations . That is , we accept that the distribution of outbreak size is similar for the three levels of crowding . 11
