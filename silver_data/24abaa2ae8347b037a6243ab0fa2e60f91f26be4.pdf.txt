Radixin is an actin barbed - end capping pro - tein which is highly concentrated in the undercoat of the cell - to - cell adherens junction and the cleavage fur - row in the interphase and mitotic phase , respectively ( Tsukita , Sa . , Y Hieda , and Sh . Tsukita . 1989a . J . Cell Biol . 108 : 2369 - 2382 ; Sato , N . , S . Yonemura , T . Obinata , Sa . Tsukita , and Sh . Tsukita . 1991 . J . Cell Biol . 113 : 321 - 330 ) . To further understand the struc - ture and functions of the radixin molecule , we isolated and sequenced the cDNA clones encoding mouse radixin . Direct peptide sequencing of radixin and im - munological analyses with antiserum to a fusion pro - tein were performed to confirm that the protein en - coded by these clones is identical to radixin . The composite cDNA is 4 , 241 nucleotides long and codes for a 583 - amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 68 . 5 kD . Sequence analysis has T HE cell - to - cell adherens junction ( AJ ) ' is a special - ized region of the plasma membrane , where cadherin molecules ( uvomorulin , L - CAM , A - CAM , etc . ) work as adhesion molecules , and actin filaments are densely as - sociated with plasma membrane through a well - developed plasmalemmal undercoat ( Farquhar and Palade , 1963 ; Gal - lin et al . , 1987 ; Geiger , 1983 ; Ringwald et al . , 1987 ; Staehe - lin , 1974 ; Takeichi , 1988 , 1990 ; Volk and Geiger , 1984 ) . It is now widely accepted that this type ofjunction is important for the formation and maintenance of tissues as well as for the transformation and metastasis of cancer cells . Recently , the cell adhesion function of cadherin molecules was reported to be regulated through the association of some cy - toplasmic proteins with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin molecules ( Nagafuchi and Takeichi , 1988 , 1989 ; Ozawa et al . , 1989 ) . Therefore , to understand the functions of AJ in molecular terms , it is prerequisite to clarify the molecular architecture of the undercoat of AJ , i . e . , the molecular link - age from cadherin molecules to actin filaments . Recent studies have revealed that the molecular organization of the undercoat of AJ is not as simple as had been expected ( Tsu - kita et al . , 1990 ) . Through immunohistochemical studies many AJ undercoat - constitutive proteins such as a - actinin , vinculin , filamin , and placoglobin have been identified ( Co - 1 . Abbreviation used in this paper : AJ , adherens junction . © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 91 / 11 / 1039 / 10 $ 2 . 00 TheJournal ofCell Biology , Volume 115 , Number4 , November 1991 1039 - 1048 (cid:9) 1039 demonstrated that mouse radixin shares 75 . 3 % identity with human ezrin , which was reported to be a mem - ber of the band 4 . 1 family . We then isolated the cDNA encoding mouse ezrin . Sequence analysis and Northern blot analysis revealed that radixin and ezrin are similar but distinct ( 74 . 9 % identity ) , leading us to conclude that radixin is a novel member of the band 4 . 1 family . In erythrocytes the band 4 . 1 protein acts as a key protein in the association of short actin filaments with a plasma membrane protein ( glycophorin ) , to - gether with spectrin . Therefore , the sequence similar - ity between radixin and band 4 . 1 protein described in this study favors the idea that radixin plays a crucial role in the association of the barbed ends of actin fila - ments with the plasma membrane in the cell - to - cell adherens junction and the cleavage furrow . win et al . , 1986 ; Geiger , 1979 ; Geiger et al . , 1984 ; Laza - rides and Burridge , 1975 ) . Recently , we developed an isola - tion method for AJ from rat liver to open the way for the systematic analysis of the molecular organization of its un - dercoat ( Tsukita and Tsukita , 1989 ) . From the isolated AJ , three novel undercoat - constitutive proteins - tenuin , radixin , and the 102 - kD cadherin - associated protein ( CAP102 ) - have been purified and characterized ( Nagafuchi et al . , 1991 ; Tsukita et al . , 1989a , b ) . Most recently , taking advantage of the isolated AJ , it was shown that specific protooncogenic tyrosine kinases of src family are highly enriched in AJ ( Tsu - kita et al . , 1991 ) . The manner of association of actin filaments with the plasma membrane in AJ in general ( end - to - membrane or side - to - membrane fashion ) remains to be clarified . How - ever , it is clear that , at least in AJ of cardiac muscle cells , all actin filaments are bound to the undercoat in an end - to - membrane fashion by their barbed ends . Therefore , one of the interesting approaches to the molecular linkage between cadherin and actin filaments from the actin side appears to be to identify a barbed - end capping protein in the AJ undercoat - constitutive proteins . Among the constituents of the AJ undercoat so far reported , only radixin shows the abil - ity to cap the barbed ends of actin filaments ( Tsukita et al . , 1989a ) . Most recently , radixin was reported to be highly concentrated at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis ( Sato on A p r il 12 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1991 et al . , 1991 ) . Considering that the most prominent feature shared by AJ and the cleavage furrow is the tight association of actin filaments with plasma membranes , it is tempting to speculate that radixin may play a crucial role in directly or indirectly binding the barbed end of actin filaments to the plasma membrane . In the present study , to clarify the structure and functions of radixin molecules in more detail , we have attempted to isolate and sequence cDNA encoding mouse radixin . The deduced amino acid sequence of radixin has led us to con - clude that radixin is homologous with but distinct from ezrin which is reported to be localized immediately under the membrane of the microvilli ( Bretscher , 1983 ; Gould et al . , 1986 ; Gould et al . , 1989 ; Pakkanen et al . , 1987 ; Thrunen et al . , 1989 ) , and that radixin is a novel member of a band 4 . 1 family . Webelieve this study will give us a clue to abetter understanding of the functions of radixin at AJ and at the cleavage furrow . Materials and Methods Purification ofRadixin and Its Direct Peptide Sequencing The AJ was prepared from mouse liver by a combination of homogeniza - tion , sucrose density centrifugation , and NP - 40 treatment as previously described ( Tsukita and Tsukita , 1989 ) . A low salt extract containing undercoat - constitutive proteins was obtained by dialysis of the AJ fraction against the extraction solution ( 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM PMSF , 1 ; 4g / ml leupeptin , 2 mMTris - HCI [ pH9 . 2 ] ) , followedbycentrifugationat 100 , 000 g for 60 min . After electrophoresis of the extract obtained from 73 mice , the band of radixin was removed with a razor blade . Such bands were pooled , and radixin was eluted electrophoretically . The eluted protein was precipitated by adding acetone , and the pellet was redissolved in 10 mM Tris - HCI ( pH 9 . 5 ) . The lysyl endopeptidase ( Wako Pure Chemical Indus - tries , LTD . , Osaka , Japan ) was added in an enzyme - to - substrate ratio of 1 : 100 ( wt / wt ) . A second aliquot of enzyme was added after digestion for 20 h at 37°C , and cleavage was continued for an additional 20 h . The en - zyme digest was subjected directly to reverse - phase HPLC ( Wakosi15c18 - 200 column ) , using a linear gradient ofacetonitrile in 0 . 1 % trifluoroacetic acid at 1 % acetonitrile per min . Selected peptide fragments were sequenced using aprotein sequencer ( model 477A , Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . cDNA Library Screening Two different XgtII expression libraries made from mouse F9 poly ( A ) + RNAs were used in the following procedures ( Nagafuchi et al . , 1987 ) . In preparing these libraries , either a random mixture of hexanucleotides or oligo ( dT ) was used as primer forthe first - strand synthesis . The initialcDNA clones , R2 and R3 ( see Fig . 1 a ) , were isolated from a randomly primed library using a polyclonal antiradixin antibody ( see Tsukita et al . , 1989a ) according to the method described by Huynh et al . ( 1985 ) , with the excep - tion that 5 % skim milk in TBS , was used as a blocking solution , instead of 20 % FCS in TBS . Then the 320 - bp Sma I - Pvu II fragment of R2 was radiolabeled with [ a - 32 P ] dCTP Using this fragment as a probe , the RTl clone ( Fig . 1 a ) was isolated from the oligo ( dT ) - primed library . To obtain cDNA encoding mouse ezrin , we rescreened the oligo ( dT ) - primed library by DNA hybridization at low stringency with R2 as a probe . Two cDNA clones , T6 and T9 , showing the same restriction map were isolated ( see Fig , 4 ) . DNA Sequencing All clones to be analyzed were subcloned into pBluescript SK ( - ) and se - quenced with the 7 - deaza Sequenase Version 2 . 0 kit ( U . S . Biochemical Corp . , Cleveland , Ohio ) . Long inserts were sequenced from nested deletion subclones created using the Deletion Kit for Kilo - Sequence ( Takara Shuzo Co . , LTD . , Kyoto , Japan ) . Both strands of all clones were sequenced . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 Isolation ofRNA and Northern Blot Hybridization Total RNAs from cultured F9 cells were isolated according to the method for rapid isolation oftotal RNA frommammalian cellsdescribedby Mania - tis et al . ( 1989 ) . Approximately 8 i ~ gperwell ofRNAwas subjectedto elec - trophoresis and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane . RNA ladder ( Bethesda Research Laboratories , Bethesda , MD ) was used as size marker . Mouse radixin cDNA R2 ( 1 . 2 kb ) and mouse ezrin cDNA ( 2 . 5 kb ) were labeled with [ a - 32 P ] dCTP using the Random Primer DNA Labeling Kit ( Takara Shuzo Co . , LTD . , Kyoto , Japan ) , and were usedas probes . Hybrid - ization was carried out at high stringency ( 50 % formamide / IOX Denhart ' s solution without BSA / 5 x SSC / 50 mMphosphate buffer [ pH 6 . 5 ] / 100 pg / pl boiled salmon sperm DNA ) . Production ofAntiserum against Radixin Fusion Protein The765 - bp Pst fragmentof R2 ( see Fig . 1 a ) was subcloned in pBluescript , and the Bam HI - Eco RV fragment was then inserted into the Bam HI site of the pGEMEX - 1 ( Promega Biotech , Madison , WI ) in frame , the expres - sion vector based onthe T7 expression systemfor high levelgene expression in vivo . Fusion proteins were expressed in JM109 ( DE3 ) synthesized ac - cording to the Promega Biotec ( Madison , WI ) procedure , and Escherichia coii lysate was separated by SDS - PAGE . The fusion protein was purified electrophoretically , and the antiserum to this purified protein was elicited in a rabbit . The affinity purification of the antibody was performed using fusion proteins bound to nitrocellulose sheets . Sequence Analysis Nucleotideandamino acid sequences were analyzed with the program from GENETYX software package ( Software Development Co . , Japan ) . Immunoblotting and Immunofiuorescence Microscopy SDS - PAGE was basedon thediscontinuous Tris - glycine system of Laemmli ( 1970 ) . Immunoblotting was performed by one - dimensional electrophore - sis , followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose sheets . Nitrocellu - lose transfers were incubated with affinity - purified antiradixin fusion pro - tein antibody . For antibody detection , a blotting detection kit ( Amersham International , Amersham UK ) was used . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of frozen sections of mouse liver was performed as described previously ( Tsukita et al . , 1989a ) . The frozen sections were air dried and fixed in 95 % ethanol at 4°C for 30 min and in 100 % acetone at room temperature for 1 min . Results Isolation and Sequencing ofcDNA Encoding Mouse Radixin We have previously obtained a polyclonal antibody specific for radixin ( Tsukita et al . , 1989a ) . Using this polyclonal an - tibody we screened - 2 . 4 x 106 plaques from a random primed Agtll cDNA library made from mouse teratocarci - noma cells ( F9 cells ) as described in Materials and Methods , and cloned two positive phage recombinants : R2 ( 1 . 2 kb ) and R3 ( 1 . 85 kb ) ( Fig . 1 a ) . Judging from their restriction maps , it was clear that these clones overlapped extensively , so both clones were sequenced . To isolate the rest of the radixin gene , - 2 x 105 colonies of the oligo ( dT ) primed Agtl l cDNA library were screened by DNA hybridization with the radiolabeled Sma I - Pvu II fragment ( 320 bp ) of R2 at high stringency . One positive clone ( RT1 ) was isolated and then sequenced . Fig . 1 a shows the overall relationship of R2 , R3 , and RTl and the restric - tion sites relevant for subcloning and sequencing . The com - plete nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid se - quences of the cloned molecule are shown in Fig . 1 b .

The calculated molecular mass ofthe protein encoded by this cloned cDNA is 68 . 5 kD . This cDNA has no long hydrophobic stretches which could encode a signal peptide or a transmembrane domain ( Fig . 2 c ) , confirming that radixin is neither a secretory protein nor a transmem - brane proteitr .

A plot of the deduced antino acid sequence of radixin against itself reveals that there is a region ( residues 304 - 468 ) within the protein con - TheJoumal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 taining short repeated similarities ( Fig . 2 a ) . This is consis - tent with the result of the secondary structure analysis of radixin , which predicts that residues 304 - 468 form an a he - lix ( Fig . 2 b ) . To confirm that the protein encoded by the above , cloned cDNA is identical to radixin , direct peptide sequencing of radixin purified from mouse liver was carried out . After lysyl endopeptidase digestion , three fragments were iso - lated . Sequencing ofall of these fragments resulted inperfect matches with the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence ( Fig . 1 b ) . Furthermore , we generated fu - sion proteins encoded by the 765 - bp Pst fragment of R2 and elicited a polyclonal antibody against this fusion protein in a rabbit . As shown in Fig . 3 , this polyclonal antibody specifically recognized the 82 - kD radixin band of F9 cells , mouse liver , and AJ fractions in immunoblot analysis , and clearly stained cell - to - cell AJ in the frozen sections ofmouse liver by immunofluorescence microscopy . Taken all together , we can conclude that the cDNA encoding mouse radixin is successfully isolated and sequenced . Isolation and Sequencing ofcDNA Encoding Mouse Ezrin Sequence analysis with the above , cloned cDNA demon - strates that mouse radixin shares 75 . 3 % identity with human ezrin ( cytovillin ) ( Gould etal . , 1989 ; Tltrunen et al . , 1989 ) . Since ezrin is reported to be localized in microvilli ofintesti - nal epithelial cells and not in the cell - to - cell adherens junc - tions , it is likely that radixin is not identical to ezrin ( Bretscher , 1983 ) . To verify this , we have isolated cDNA en - coding " mouse " ezrin . For this purpose , R2 was used to screen - 3 . 2 x 105 colonies of an oligo ( dT ) - primed Xgtll cDNA library made frommouse F9 cells by DNA hybridiza - tion at low stringency , and eight positive clones were ob - tained . Judging from restriction maps of the inserts of posi - tive clones , a single class of clones ( e . g . , T6 and T9 in Fig . 4 a ) was identified , which was distinct from cDNA encoding radixin . Then , the longest of these cDNA clones ( T9 ) was sequenced . This cDNA is 2 , 701 nucleotides long , has a 95 - nucleotide - long Y - untranslated sequence , codes for a 586 - amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 69 . 3 kD , and has an 848 - nucleotide - long Y - untranslated se - quence ( Fig . 4 b ) . The putativeprotein encoded by this cDNA clone is almost identical to human ezrin ( 96 . 2 % identity ) . Furthermore , the Y - untranslated sequences of this cDNA were also highly homologous to those ofhuman ezrin cDNA ( Fig . 5 ) . These data conclusively show that cDNA clone T9 ( and also T6 ) encodes " mouse ezrin . Comparison ofRadixin with Ezrin Now that both cDNA clones encoding mouse radixin and mouse ezrin have been obtained , the primary structure ofthe radixin molecule canbe directly compared with thatofezrin . Based on the alignment shown in Fig . 6 a , mouse radixin shares 74 . 9 % identity with mouse ezrin . As compared to the carboxyl - terminal half of these molecules , amino acid sub - stitutions in the amino - terminal halfare highly conservative ; 85 . 6 % identity for the residues 1 - 311 , and 43 % identity for the residues 312 - 000H terminus ( Fig . 6 b ) . To detect mRNA encoding radixin and ezrin , Northern blot analysis with total mRNA obtained from mouse F9 cells 1042 on A p r il 12 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1991 Figure 3 . Immunoblotting analysis ( a ) and indirect immunofluorescence staining ( b ) with the polyclonal antibody raised against the radixin fusion protein . ( a ) Coomassie blue - stained gels ( lanes 1 - 3 ) and the corresponding immunoblot profiles with the antiradixin fusion protein antibody ( lanes 1 ' - 3 ' ) . ( Lanes 1 and f ) Low salt extract of isolated mouse AJ ; ( lanes 2 and 2 ' ) F9 cells ; ( lanes 3 and 3 ' ) mouse liver . Arrowheads indicate the major constituents of the undercoat of adherens AJ ( 400 [ tenuin ] , 240 , 235 , 130 [ vinculin ] , 100 [ a - actinin ] , 82 [ radixin ] , 70 , 55 , 50 , and 43 kD [ actin ] from the top ) . Only a single band corresponding to radixin ( 82 kD ) is detected in each sample . A faint staining around 130 kD in lane 2 ' appears to correspond to a dimeric form of radixin , since radixin occasionally forms a dimer even in SDS - PAGE sample buffer ( our unpublished data ) . ( b ) Immunofluorescence staining of frozen sections ofmouse liver cells . Intense fluorescence appears on both sides of the bile canaliculi , resulting in a pair of parallel lines . Bar , 10 pm . was performed using R2 ( see Fig . 1 a ) and T9 ( see Fig . 4 a ) as probes for radixin and ezrin , respectively . As shown in Fig . 7 , the band at 4 . 2 kb was detected by R2 ( radixin ) , while the band at 2 . 7 kb was hybridized to T9 ( ezrin ) . ' Faking the distribution of the nonidentical residues between radixin and ezrin into consideration , we are led to conclude that these mRNAs are not derived from a single gene by an alternative splicing mechanism . Comparison ofRadixin with the Other Members ofthe Band 4 . 1 Family Recently the existence of a novel family of submembranous cytoskeleton - associated proteins has been recognized . These include band 4 . 1 protein from red blood cells , ezrin ( also called cytovillin or p81 ) , and talin ( Conboy et al . , 1986 ; Gould et al . , 1989 ; Rees et al . , 1990 ; Turunen et al . , 1989 ) . Each member of this band 4 . 1 family was reported to have a homologous N112 - terminal domain followed by a domain rich in a helix and a highly charged COOH - terminal seg - ment ( Rees et al . , 1990 ) . Radixin shares these structural fea - tures with these band 4 . 1 - like proteins . Fig . 8 clearly reveals Funayama et al . Primary Structure ofRadixin the existence of the homologous NHZ - terminal domain in radixin molecule . Taking all these findings together , we can conclude that radixin is a novel member of the band 4 . 1 family . Discussion We have isolated cDNA encoding mouse radixin . The se - quence of radixin was determined from three overlapping clones encoding a protein of 583 amino acids . Identification of these clones as radixin came from two pieces of evidence . First , the direct peptide sequencing of three lysyl endopep - tidase - digested fragments of radixin resulted in perfect matches with the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence . Second , antiserum to a radixin fusion pro - tein specifically recognized the mouse radixin molecule in immunoblotting analysis and clearly stained the cell - to - cell AJ by immunofluorescence microscopy . Interestingly , se - quence analysis with this radixin cDNA has revealed that mouse radixin shows a similarity to human ezrin . In addi - tion , we have cloned cDNA encoding mouse ezrin and 1043 on A p r il 12 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1991 b P P P P I (cid:9) I I I T9 Tg (cid:9) o as kalb GGTCCCGACGCGTCTCCGCCGCCCTCGCCCTCCCCCTCGCCTCCGCCGTACAGCCGAATAGCCGAGGACCCACGCAGAGCCACCAACCAGCCAAGATOCCCAAGCCAATCAACGTCC000 120 M P K P I N V R V TGACCACCATOOATGCCGAGCTGGAGTTTGCCATCCAGCCAAACACCACCGGGAAGCAGCTCTTTGATCAGGTGGTAAAGACGATTGGCCTCCGGGAAGTGTOOTACTTCOGCCTGCCGT 240 T T M D A E L E F A I Q P N T T G K Q L F D Q V V K T I G L R E V W Y F G L P Y ATGTAGACAATAAAGGATTTCCTACCTGGCTGAAACTTGATAAAAAGGTCTCCGCACAGGAGGTCCGAAAGGAGAACCCTGTCCAGTTTAAATTCCGGGCCAAGTTCTACCCCOAAOACO 360 V D N K G F P T W L K L D K K V S A Q E V R K E N P V Q F K F R A K F Y P E D V TGGCCGAGGAACTCATCCAGGACATCACACAGAAGCTCTTCTTCCTGCAAGTCAACGACGGGATCCTCAGCGACGAGATCTACTGCCCCCCAGAOACAGCCOTOCTCCTGGGCTCCTATG 480 A E E L I Q D I T Q K L F F L Q V K D G I L S D E I Y C P P E T A V L L G S Y A CCGTTCAGGCCAAGTTCGGAGATTATAACAAGGAAATGCACAAGTCTGGGTACCTCAGCTCGGAGCGGCTGATCCCCCAGAGAGTCATGGACCAACACAAGCTCAGCAGOGACCAGTGGO $ 00 V Q A K F G D Y N K E M H K S G Y L S S E R L I P Q R V M D Q H K L S R D ' Q W E AGGACCGGATCCAGGTGTGGCACGCGGAACACCGAGGGATGCTCAAGGACAGTGCTATGCTGGAATACCTGAAGATTGCCCAGGACCTGGAAATGTATGGGATCAACTATTrCOAGATCA 720 D R I Q V W H A E H R G M L K D S A M L E Y L K I A Q D L E M Y G I N Y F E I K AAAACAAGAAAGGAACAGACCTTTGGCTTGGAGTCGATGCCCTTGGACTTAACATTTATGAGAAAGATGACAAGTTGACCCCAAAGATCGGCTTCCCTTCGAGTGAGATCAGGAACATCT 840 N K K G T D L W L G V D A L G L N I Y E K D D K L T P K I G F P W S E I R N I S CTTTCAACGACAAGAAGTTTGTCATTAAGCCCATCGACAAGAAGGCACCTGACTTTGTGTTCTACGCCCCGCGCCTGAGAATTAACAAGCGGATCCTGCAGCTCTGCATGGGGAACCATG 960 F N D K K F V I K P I D K K A P D F V F Y A P R L R I N K R I L Q L C M G N H E AGCTGTACATGCGCCGCAGGAAGCCCGACACCATCGAGGTGCAGCAGATGAAGGCCCAGGCTCGGGAGGAGAAGCACCAGAAGCAGCTAGAGCGACAGCAGTTGGAAGCCGAGAAGAAGA 1080 L Y M R R R K P D T I E V Q Q M K A Q A R E E K H Q K Q L E R Q Q L E A E K K R GGCGAGAGACGGTGGAGAGAGAAAAGGAGCAGATGCTCCGGGAGAAGGAGGAGCTGATGCTTCGGCTGCAGGACTACGAGCAGAAGACCAAGAGGGCGGAGAAAGAGCTCTCCGAGCAGA 1200 R E T V E R E K E Q M L R E K E E L M L R L Q D Y E Q K T K R A E K E L S E Q I TTGAGAAGGCCCTCCAACTGGAGGAAGAGAGGAGGCGAGCCCAGGAGGAGGCTGAACGTCTGGAGGCCGACCGCATGGCCGCCCTGCGGGCCAAGGAAGAACTCGAGAGACAGGCGCAGG 1320 E K A L Q L E E E R R R A .

These sequence data are available from EMBL / GenBank / DDBJ under accession number x60671 . confirmed that radixin is distinct from ezrin although they share 74 . 9 % amino acid sequence identity . Ezrin ( also called cytovillin or p81 ) was originally identified as an undercoat - constitutive protein of the microvilli plasma membrane ( Bretscher , 1983 ; Pakkanen et al . , 1987 ) , and was reported to be a good substrate in vivo for some tyrosine kinases ( Bretscher , 1989 ; Gould et al . , 1986 ; Hunter and Cooper , 1981 , 1983 ) . Recent sequence analysis of ezrin has revealed that ezrin shows homology to the band 4 . 1 protein of erythro - cyte membranes ( Conboy et al . , 1986 ; Gould et al . , 1989 ; T1lrunen et al . , 1989 ) . Most recently , talin , a major TheJoumal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 undercoat - constitutive protein at the cell - to - substrate AJ , was also reported to be a member of this band 4 . 1 family ( Burridge and Connell , 1983 ; Burridge and Mangeat , 1984 ; Rees et al . , 1990 ) . Our present data add radixin as a new member to the band 4 . 1 family . In various types of cells , there are some specialized regions of the cell surface which are tightly associated with actin filaments : the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis , cell - to - cell AJ , cell - to - substrate AJ ( focal contacts ) , ruffling membrane , and microvilli . According to the previous im - munolocalization results , it may be safe to say that the first 1044 on A p r il 12 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1991 ÇL N Wc 0 E 750 - i5ee 225 300 Mouse Ezrin 750 1500 2250 Figure S .

What we can say at present is that the band 4 . 1 - like proteins play a pivotal role in cytokinesis , cell adhesion , and cell motility by directly or indirectly linking actin filaments to plasma membranes . To understand the physiological functions of these band 4 . 1 - like proteins in molecular terms , the following question must be answered in future : How do these proteins interact with actin filaments ? Band 4 . 1 protein is one ofthe major ac - cessory proteins of human erythrocyte membranes , and as - sociated with spectrin and actin in membrane skeletons ( Bennett , 1989 ) . In vitro assays so far clarified the following properties ofband 4 . 1 protein . ( a ) It participates in a ternary or higher order complex together with spectrin and actin . ( b ) It binds directly to spectrin and promotes spectrin binding to actin . ( c ) It does not interact directly with actin ( Bennett , 1989 ; Correas et al . , 1986 ; Fowler and Taylor , 1980 ; Oha - nian et al . , 1984 ; Ungewickell et al . , 1979 ) . In sharp con - trast , radixin specifically binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments ( T § ukita et al . , 1989a ) . As shown in Figs . 8 and 9 , the amino acid sequence of an NH2 - terminal domain of band 4 . 1 protein is homologous to that of radixin , and the binding site for a plasma membrane protein ( glycophorin ) is mapped to this domain of band 4 . 1 protein ( Leto et al . , 1986 ) . Therefore , the rest part of each molecule ( 000H - terminal half ) seems likely to have a bearing on the interac - tion ofeach with cytoskeletal proteins . Actually , the 000H - terminal half of band 4 . 1 protein is reported to contain the spectrin - binding region ( Correas et al . , 1986 ) . The amino acid sequence of this COOH - terminal half of band 4 . 1 pro - tein is not homologous to that ofradixin . This suggests that the COOH - terminal half of radixin is responsible for its barbed - end capping activity , although there are no obvious homologies between radixin and other barbed - end capping proteins such as gelsolin ( Dieffenbach et al . , 1989 ) , fragmin ( Ampe and Vandekerckhove , 1987 ) , and Cap - Z protein ( Casella et al . , 1989 ; Caldwell et al . , 1989 ) . Considering that the other members of the band 4 . 1 family such as ezrin and talin have their respective COOH - terminal domains , it is likely that these proteins interact with cytoskeletons in dis - tinct manners . No evidence has yet been obtained for any di - rect interaction between actin filaments and ezrin . Tàlin was believed not to directly interact with actin filaments , but re - cently the direct interaction between talin and actin was reported ( Muguruma et al . , 1990 ) . The interaction of these band 4 . 1 - like proteins with actin filaments should be exam - ined under various conditions , for example , in the presence of phospholipids and / or other protein factors . The existence of an homologous NH2 - terminal domain in proteins ofthe band 4 . 1 family will give us a clue toward un - derstanding their physiological functions . In band 4 . 1 pro - tein , this domain contains a binding site for glycophorin A or glycophorin C ( also called glycoconnectin ) , one of the major membrane proteins in erythrocytes ( Anderson and Lovrien , 1984 ; Anderson and Marchesi , 1985 ; Bennett , 1989 ; Leto et al . , 1986 ; Mueller and Morrison , 1981 ) . As shown in Fig . 6 , this domain is highly homologous between radixin and ezrin , leading us to speculate that a single class of membrane protein may be present in cell - to - cell AJ , cleavage furrows , and microvilli as membrane - attachment sites for radixin and ezrin and that this membrane protein may have a similarity to glycophorin A or glycophorin C ( glycoconnectin ) . In this study , we have shown that radixin is a new member ofthe band 4 . 1 family . Recent studies have suggested the pos - sibility that in addition to band 4 . 1 protein , ezrin , talin , and radixin , many other proteins may be included in the band 4 . 1 family ( Spiegel et al . , 1984 ; Bretscher , 1989 ; Birgbauer and Solomon , 1989 ) . For example , a nonerythroid 4 . 1 variant was identified in lymphocytes and its cDNA was cloned and sequenced , indicating that mRNAs of both erythrocyte and 1046 on A p r il 12 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 15 , 1991 lymphocyte band 4 . 1 proteins are produced from a single gene by alternative splicing ( Tanget al . , 1988 ) ( Fig . 9 ) . The relationship of radixin and ezrin to this variant in noneryth - roid cells remains to be clarified . The expression experi - ments using cDNAsencoding the members ofband 4 . 1 fam - ily will lead us to abetter understanding ofthe physiological roles of these band 4 . 1 - like proteins .
