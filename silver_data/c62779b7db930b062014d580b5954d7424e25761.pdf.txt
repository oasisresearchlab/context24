Here we show that RESV counteracts the TGF -  - induced Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) phenotype in mammary gland cells and affects the alternative exon usage of pre - mRNAs that encode crucial factors in adhesion and migration —including CD44 , ENAH , and FGFR2— in a panel of immortalized and transformed mammary gland cells . RESV causes a shift from the mesenchymal - specific forms of these factors to the respective epithelial forms and increases the expression of the RNA - binding proteins KHSRP and hnRNPA1 . From a mechanistic point of view , we show that the combined silencing of KHSRP and hnRNPA1 prevents the RESV - dependent inclusion of the epithelial - type exons in the Cd44 pre - mRNA . Our findings support an unexpected regulatory mechanism where RESV limits EMT by controlling gene expression at post - transcriptional level . Highlights  Resveratrol prevents TGF -  - induced EMT in mammary gland cells ;  Resveratrol favors the epithelial - type alternative splicing of Cd44 , Enah , and Fgfr2 ;  Resveratrol enhances the expression of KHSRP and other RBPs in mammary gland cells . Keywords . Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition ; Resveratrol ; Alternative splicing ; RNA - Binding Proteins . A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 1 . Introduction . Resveratrol ( RESV ) is a polyphenolic phytoalexin derived from a number of plants including berries , grapes , and peanuts [ 1 ] . In the last years RESV has been proven to exert anti - oxidant , anti - inflammatory , anti - proliferative , as well as pro - apoptotic activities [ 1 ] . As a consequence , RESV might have beneficial effects in reducing the risk of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases , diabetes , and cancer [ 2 , 3 ] . The ability of RESV to induce apoptosis as well as to suppress proliferation and invasion has been demonstrated in a number of cell lines and , although there are still unsolved mechanistic questions to be faced , RESV holds promising anti - tumor potential [ 3 , 4 ] . Many effects of RESV are operated through Sirtuin1 ( SIRT1 ) activation which , in turn , modulates cellular function by deacetylation of transcription factors and other proteins even if some studies questioned the role of SIRT1 as a direct binding partner of RESV [ 5 ] . Recently , a role for RESV has been proposed in limiting the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition ( EMT ) , a multi - step reversible trans - differentiation event in which epithelial cells lose their characteristics and instead acquire mesenchymal properties with transforming growth factor  ( TGF -  ) being a major inducer of the process [ 6 - 9 ] . EMT has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes , including embryonic development , wound healing , organ fibrosis , cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy [ 9 ] . It has been demonstrated that modulation of alternative pre - RNA splicing operated by several RNA - Binding Proteins ( RBPs ) —including ESRP1 / 2 , hnRNPM , DDX5 / 17 , and RBFOX2—plays a causal role in EMT [ 9 - 14 ] . Recently , we reported that miRNA - mediated silencing of the single - strand RBP KHSRP is required for TGF -  - induced EMT in non - transformed NMuMg mammary gland cells [ 15 ] . We demonstrated that KHSRP controls both the levels of mature miR - 192 - 5p ( a microRNA that targets a group of EMT factors ) and the alternative splicing of a cohort of pre - mRNAs related to cell adhesion and motility such as Cd44 [ 15 ] . KHSRP belongs to a ribonucleoprotein complex that includes hnRNPA1 and we showed that the two proteins cooperate in promoting epithelial - type exon usage of select pre - mRNAs in non - transformed mammary gland cells [ 15 ] . KHSRP exerts various roles in the post - transcriptional control of gene expression and its ability in modulating the half - life of inherently unstable mRNAs , such as pro - inflammatory cytokines ( including TNF and IL8 ) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( NOS2 ) , has been extensively studied in the last years [ 16 , 17 ] . Recently , Bollmann et al . demonstrated that RESV interacts with KHSRP and prevents its p38 MAPK - dependent phosphorylation [ 18 ] . As a consequence , KHSRP binding to target mRNAs as well as its interaction with the RNA exosome A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT is enhanced and TNF , IL8 and NOS2 mRNA half - life is decreased . These effects are SIRT1 - independent and might explain the anti - inflammatory effects of RESV [ 18 ] . Little is known on the role of RESV in alternative splicing regulation [ 19 - 21 ] and its activity in regulating the alternative splicing of pre - mRNAs in EMT has never been addressed . For all the above reasons , we decided to investigate the potential regulatory role of RESV on KHSRP functions in TGF -  - induced EMT in mammary gland cells . We found that RESV treatment of a panel of either immortalized or transformed mammary gland cells affects the alternative splicing of pre - mRNAs that encode factors implicated in cell adhesion and migration by modulating the expression of the RBPs KHSRP and hnRNPA1 . 2 . Materials and Methods . 2 . 1 . Cell cultures and treatments . Murine immortalized NMuMg cells ( obtained from ATCC , no . CRL - 1636 ) were cultured in DMEM plus 10 % FBS and 10  g / ml bovine Insulin ( Sigma ) . Py2T cells , originally isolated from a breast tumor of a MMTV - PyMT female mouse with a FVB / N background , were a kind gift of Dr . G . Christofori ( University of Basel , CH ) and were cultured in DMEM plus 10 % FBS as described [ 22 ] . 4T1 ( obtained from ATCC , no . CRL - CRL - 2539 ) and TS / A mouse mammary gland cancer cells ( obtained from Dr . C . Bagni , VIB Center for the Biology of Disease , Leuven , B ) were cultured in DMEM / F12 plus 10 % FBS . Human mammary gland adenocarcinoma cells MDA - MB - 231 ( obtained from Dr . G . Fronza , IRCCS San Martino - IST , Genova , I ) were cultured in DMEM plus 5 % FBS . HEK293 cells ( obtained from ATCC , no . CRL - 1573 ) were cultured in DMEM plus 10 % FBS . NMuMg and Py2T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2 % and 1 % FBS , respectively , for 8 - 16 h prior to the addition of 10 ng / ml human recombinant TGF -  1 purchased from R & D Systems . Resveratrol ( RESV ) was purchased from Sigma ( R5010 ) , dissolved in DMSO at a 100 mM concentration , and used at a 75  M concentration in the majority of the experiments . 2 . 2 . Scratch Wound Closure Assay . NMuMg and 4T1 cells were cultured in six - wells plates up to confluence . A wound was scratched into monolayers and cultures were treated for 40 h with either RESV or DMSO . Images were taken using an Olympus CKX41 microscope and analyzed using the ImageJ 1 . 49r package A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT ( http : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / index . html ) . Average distance of wound obtained from six microscopic fields was used for calculation of percent wound healed . Experiments were performed three times in triplicate . 2 . 3 . Antibodies . Affinity - purified rabbit polyclonal anti - KHSRP antibody and the corresponding pre - immune serum were previously described [ 23 ] ; mouse monoclonal anti - ACTB ( also known as  - actin ) and mouse monoclonal anti - hnRNPA1 ( 4B10 ) antibodies were from Sigma . Immunoblots were quantitated using ImageJ 1 . 49r software . 2 . 4 . Cell transfections . Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( ThermoFischer ) . Stable KHSRP knock - down was obtained using previously described silencing sequences cloned in pSuper . Neo or pSuper . Puro ( Oligoengine ) for NMuMg and 4T1 , respectively [ 15 ] . Stable shKHSRP NMuMg transfectants were obtained using G418 ( Sigma ) selection ( 800 μg / ml ) [ 15 ] . Either stable hnRNPA1 knock - down ( generated transfecting cells with hnRNPA1 shRNA plasmid [ sc - 35576 - SH , Santa Cruz Biotechnologies ] ) or stable KHSRP knock - down were obtained using Puromycin selection ( 5 . 0 μg / ml , ThermoFischer ) in 4T1 cells . Double knock - down ( shKHSRP / shhnRNPA1 ) was obtained transfecting cells with pSuper . Neo - shKHSRP and hnRNPA1 shRNA plasmid . Then transfected 4T1 cells were selected in both G418 ( 100 μg / ml ) and Puromycin ( 5 . 0 μg / ml ) . A minigene splicing reporter construct that contains the CD44 v8 exon and its flanking introns ( kindly provided by Dr . Chonghui Cheng [ 12 ] ) was transfected into HEK - 293 cells using Attractene transfection Reagent ( Qiagen ) . siRNAs utilized to knock - down human KHSRP ( 5’— GAUCAACCGGAGAGCAAGA—3’ ) and human hnRNPA1 ( 5’— AACUUUGGUGGUGGUCGUGGA—3’ ) were purchased from Sigma . 2 . 5 . RNA preparation , RT - PCR , and quantitative RT - PCR . Total RNA was isolated using either the miRNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen ) or QIAzol Lysis Reagent ( Qiagen ) and retro - transcribed ( 50 - 100 ng ) using either miScript reverse transcription kit ( Qiagen ) or Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase ( Roche ) according to manufacturers’ instructions . PCR analysis was performed using the GO - Taq system ( Promega ) and PCR products were analyzed by agarose ( 2 % in TAE ) gel electrophoresis . Quantitative PCR was performed using either the miScript SYBR green PCR kit ( Qiagen ) or the Precision 2X QPCR Master Mix ( Primer Design ) , and the Realplex II Mastercycler ( Eppendorf ) . For some experiments the end - points of A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT the qPCR reactions were analysed by agarose gel ( 2 % in TAE buffer ) electrophoresis . The sequence - specific primers utilized for PCR reactions are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . 3 . Results . 3 . 1 . Resveratrol prevents TGF -  - induced EMT in mammary gland cells . In order to investigate whether RESV affects TGF -  - induced EMT in mammary gland cells , murine immortalized NMuMg cells were pre - treated for 2 hours with RESV ( concentrations ranging from 5 to 150  M ) , exposed to 10 ng / ml TGF -  for 2 days and the expression levels of a representative group of factors crucial to EMT were analyzed by RT - qPCR . As shown in Fig . 1A , 75  M RESV significantly impaired basal and TGF -  - induced expression of mesenchymal factors and enhanced miR - 200c expression while reduced miR - 155 expression . Consistent with a role of RESV in antagonizing cell migration , scratch wound assays revealed that RESV treatment reduces the gap closure in a time - dependent manner when compared to negative control ( DMSO ) - treated cells ( Fig . 1B ) . The observation that RESV prevents the TGF -  - induced expression of mesenchymal factors was extended to murine Py2T cells ( Fig . 1C and data not shown ) . Figure 1D and Supplementary Fig . S1 show that RESV treatment was able to revert the expression of EMT makers also in NMuMg cells that had achieved a clear mesenchymal phenotype in response to a three - days TGF -  treatment . Altogether these observations indicate that RESV strongly counteracts the TGF -  - induced EMT phenotype in mammary gland cells . 3 . 2 . Resveratrol promotes the epithelial - type alternative splicing of Cd44 , Enah , and Fgfr2 pre - mRNAs in mammary gland cells . Recent evidence suggested that modulation of the alternative splicing of specific pre - RNAs , including Cd44 , Enah , and Fgfr2 , plays a causative role in EMT [ 9 - 11 ] . We wanted to investigate whether the alternative splicing of pre - mRNAs that encode factors implicated in EMT is affected by RESV in mammary gland cells . A schematic representation of the exon - intron structure of Cd44 , Enah , and Fgfr2 pre - mRNAs is presented in Supplementary Fig . S2A . As shown in Fig . 2A , RESV significantly reduced the ratio between the mesenchymal - type Cd44s A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT and the epithelial - type Cd44v isoforms ( Cd44s / Cd44v ) in both untreated and TGF -  - treated NMuMg cells . NMuMg cells express seven Cd44 mRNA isoforms due to alternative usage of the ten variable exons ( R . G . and P . B . , unpublished observation ) . Exon 6 is one of the Cd44 exons whose exclusion is induced by TGF -  ( left panel in Supplementary Fig . S2B ) . Supplementary Fig . S2B ( right panel ) shows that RESV treatment prevents the TGF -  - dependent exclusion of Cd44 exon 6 in NMuMg cells . Similarly , RESV favored the inclusion of the epithelial - type exon 6L of Enah ( increased Enah6L / Enah6 ratio ) and of the epithelial - specific exon IIIb of Fgfr2 ( decreased Fgfr2 IIIc / IIIb ratio ) ( Fig . 2A ) . Figure 2B shows that RESV induced a similar splicing pattern in Py2T cells . Further , we observed that RESV treatment of NMuMg cells that achieved an overt mesenchymal phenotype ( through a three - day treatment with TGF -  reverted the mesenchymal - type splicing pattern of Cd44 , Enah , and Fgfr2 pre - mRNAs despite the continuous presence of TGF -  ( Fig . 2C ) . RESV has been reported to limit breast cancer cells proliferation and invasiveness [ reviewed in 24 ] . We investigated whether RESV is able to increase the expression of epithelial - type versus mesenchymal - type factors in transformed mammary gland cells . A 24h RESV treatment significantly enhanced the expression of epithelial - type cadherin Cdh1 ( also known as E - cadherin ) while reduced the levels of mesenchymal - and invasiveness - related factors such as Fn1 , Fstl1 , and Mmp9 in 4T1 , TS / A , and MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 3A , 3B , Supplementary Fig . 3A and data not shown ) . In line with these results , scratch wound assays revealed that the gap closure was significantly reduced by RESV treatment in 4T1 and TS / A cells when compared to control ( DMSO - treated ) cells ( Fig . 3C and data not shown ) . Recent experimental evidence connected the molecular program of alternative splicing regulation with the occurrence of metastasis in patients [ 12 - 14 ] . We investigated the ability of RESV to affect the alternative exon usage of Cd44 and Enah in transformed mammary gland cell lines . Cultures were treated with RESV for 24 hours and the expression of epithelial - and mesenchymal - type splicing variants of Cd44 and Enah pre - mRNAs was quantitated by RT - qPCR analysis . As presented in Fig . 3D and Supplementary Fig . 3B , RESV favored the inclusion of the respective epithelial - type splicing variants also in 4T1 , TS / A , and MDA - MB - 231 cells . Altogether our data indicate that RESV affects the alternative exon usage of pre - mRNAs that encode factors crucial to adhesion and migration in both immortalized and transformed mammary gland cells . A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 3 . 3 . Resveratrol upregulates KHSRP and hnRNPA1 expression to favor the epithelial - type alternative splicing of Cd44 pre - mRNA in mammary gland cells . We recently reported that TGF -  - dependent KHSRP down - regulation is required to favor the mesenchymal - type splicing pattern of Cd44 , Enah , Fgfr2 , and other pre - mRNAs during EMT [ 15 ] . Based on these findings , we hypothesized that RESV may affect the alternative splicing of select pre - mRNAs influencing KHSRP expression . Indeed , RESV treatment increased the expression of KHSRP in untreated NMuMg cells and restored , in part , its levels in TGF -  - treated cells ( Fig . 4A ) . RESV did not enhance KHSRP transcription ( data not shown ) while , in agreement with our recent observation that miR - 27b - 3p causes KHSRP down - regulation in NMuMg cells [ 15 ] , RESV prevented TGF -  - induced miR - 27b - 3p up - regulation ( Supplementary Fig . S4A ) thus suggesting that RESV affects KHSRP expression at post - transcriptional level . Further support to our hypothesis that RESV influences alternative splicing by regulating KHSRP levels was provided by the evidence that RESV treatment controls the alternative isoform usage of an additional group of pre - mRNAs that we have previously reported to be splicing targets of KHSRP ( Supplementary Fig . S4B ) [ 15 ] . In order to verify our hypothesis , we analyzed the response to RESV in KHSRP - silenced mammary gland cells compared to mock - silenced cells . KHSRP silencing significantly limited — but failed to abrogate— the RESV - dependent reduction of the Cd44s / Cd44v ratio in NMuMg cells ( Fig . 4B ) . Similar effect of KHSRP silencing was obtained in 4T1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S4C , S4D ) . Even though the ability of RESV to up - regulate the expression of the small residual amount of KHSRP still present in shKHSRP cells ( Supplementary Fig . S4E and data not shown ) could explain , at least in part , the incomplete effect of KHSRP silencing , our results prompted us to investigate additional mechanisms for the effect of RESV on Cd44 alternative splicing modulation . We have recently shown that the RBP hnRNPA1 , a molecular partner of KHSRP [ 15 and literature cited therein ] , is able to interact with KHSRP to form a ribonucleoprotein complex that promotes the epithelial - type exon usage of Cd44 in NMuMg cells and that both KHSRP and hnRNPA1 directly interact with an intronic consensus motif of Cd44 pre - mRNA [ 15 ] . Thus , we explored the possibility that RESV may affect the expression also of hnRNPA1 . Indeed , Fig . 4C and 4D show that this is the case in both NMuMg and 4T1 cells . Next , we stably silenced hnRNPA1 and analyzed the effects of RESV on Cd44 pre - mRNA alternative splicing ( Supplementary Fig . S4F ) . As shown in Fig . 4E , hnRNPA1 silencing in 4T1 cells significantly limited the RESV - dependent reduction of the Cd44s / Cd44v ratio although failed to completely A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT prevent the RESV - induced epithelial - type Cd44 alternative splicing . Thus , considering that the individual silencing of either KHSRP or hnRNPA1 failed to completely abrogate RESV effect on Cd44 alternative splicing , we decided to simultaneously silence both KHSRP and hnRNPA1 in 4T1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S4F ) and to quantitate the Cd44 pre - mRNA alternative splicing isoforms . As shown in Fig . 4F , the double stable silencing of KHSRP and hnRNPA1 almost completely prevented the induction of the epithelial - type Cd44 exon usage by RESV . In order to strengthen these findings , we transiently expressed a minigene splicing reporter construct including CD44 exon v8 and its flanking introns in HEK - 293 cells in which RESV is able to modulate the alternative splicing of endogenous CD44 pre - mRNA ( Fig . 5A ) . Figure 5B shows that RESV significantly decreased the skipped / included exon v8 ratio as evaluated by qRT - PCR using specific primer sets that amplify exon CD44v8 - included and CD44v8 - skipped products . Agarose gel electrophoresis of end - point RT - qPCR reactions shows a reduction of the exon v8 - skipped product and a strong increase in exon v8 - included PCR product ( Fig . 5C ) . Finally , silencing of both KHSRP and hnRNPA1 almost completely hindered the effect of RESV on the splicing pattern of CD44 exon v8 minigene in HEK - 293 cells ( Fig . 5D ) . As a whole our data indicate that RESV affects Cd44 alternative splicing by upregulating the expression of KHSRP and hnRNPA1 and that the combined silencing of these two RBPs prevents its action . 4 . Discussion . In this report , we show that the natural polyphenolic compound RESV limits EMT in mammary gland cells by affecting the alternative splicing pattern of pre - mRNAs related to cell adhesion and motility including Cd44 , Fgfr2 , and Enah . Our data indicate that RESV causes a shift from the mesenchymal - specific forms of the encoded factors to the respective epithelial forms in both immortalized and transformed mammary gland cells by modulating the expression of KHSRP and hnRNPA1 . Markus et al . previously reported that RESV can affect the alternative splicing of transfected minigenes suggesting that this might be due to enhanced expression of a group RBPs [ 20 ] . Our data demonstrate that RESV modulates the alternative splicing of endogenous pre - mRNAs that exert a crucial role in EMT and that RESV - dependent upregulation of KHSRP and hnRNPA1 is critical to enhance the epithelial - type exon usage of Cd44 pre - mRNA in mammary gland cells . A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Emerging evidence has suggested that modulation of alternative pre - mRNA splicing plays a causal role in EMT and different studies have also revealed that alternative splicing of select pre - mRNAs may be associated with epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes and with tumor invasiveness [ 9 - 14 ] . Here it is tempting to propose that RESV - dependent inhibition of EMT relies on modulation of the alternative splicing of specific pre - RNAs that is mediated , at least in part , by the upregulation of KHSRP and hnRNPA1 . Pautz and Coworkers have demonstrated that RESV directly interacts with KHSRP and modulates its mRNA decay promoting activity thus resulting in down - regulation of pro - inflammatory cytokine expression in colon cancer cells [ 18 ] . In their report the Authors show that RESV reduces the p38 MAPK - dependent threonine phosphorylation that has inhibitory effects on KHSRP mRNA decay - promoting function [ 18 , 25 ] . It is well known that KHSRP post - transcriptionally controls gene expression at multiple levels in response to distinct stimuli depending on the cellular context [ 16 , 17 ] . We and others have reported that various cellular effectors influence KHSRP function through phosphorylation and / or cellular localization [ 16 , 17 ] . However , we have recently demonstrated that KHSRP down - regulation —instead of a functional modulation of the protein— reshapes the transcriptome and plays a crucial role in TGF -  - induced EMT in mammary gland cells [ 15 ] . Thus , it is not surprising that RESV exerts its effect regulating KHSRP levels even though our experiments cannot exclude a RESV - induced modulation of KHSRP function . It is interesting to note that we previously observed that several breast cancer cell lines , including 4T1 , display a limited EMT response to TGF -  and that TGF -  fails to reduce KHSRP levels [ 15 ] . Our current data indicate that RESV up - regulates KHSRP expression also in 4T1 cells and that KHSRP silencing strongly influence alternative splicing in these cells . This reinforces the idea that RESV controls KHSRP function through modulation of its expression levels , at least in mammary gland cells . Recent evidence demonstrated that several RBPs coordinately regulate hundreds of pre - mRNA alternative splicing events forming dynamically regulated ribonucleoprotein complexes [ 26 , 27 ] . Thus , although in our cellular models RESV activity on Cd44 pre - mRNA splicing is abrogated by the combined silencing of KHSRP and hnRNPA1 , it is very likely that RESV may target distinct ribonucleoprotein complexes to modulate pre - mRNA alternative splicing in other cellular contexts . The importance of alternative splicing in various diseases [ 28 ] makes the identification of non - toxic compounds that inhibit certain splicing events of notable interest . Indeed , RESV ability to modulate the function and expression of different RBPs including KHSRP and hnRNPA1 A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT might account for a part of the wide range of beneficial effects shown by the compound . However , RESV ability to affect different targets at different levels raises a specificity issue and makes compelling the necessity to investigate the whole spectrum of RESV potentialities at the molecular level .
