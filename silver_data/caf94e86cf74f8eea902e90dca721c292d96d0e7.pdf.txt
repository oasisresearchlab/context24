Aortic cell samples obtained from patients harboring the R256H mutation , the third most common of this group , reveal a lack of α - SM organization . However , the biochemical mechanisms contributing to this disorganization have yet to be elucidated . Biochemical analysis of these mutations is critical to understanding the mechanisms underlying this disease ; however , this goal proves difficult due to the inability to obtain diseased aortic tissue , the difficulty in purifying pure mutant actin from smooth muscle tissue , and the absence of a sufficient animal model . The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single actin - encoding gene , ACT1 , that shares 86 % homology with human α - SM actin , making it a viable model system for analysis of TAAD mutations . Regulation of actin function by actin binding proteins is conserved between yeast and humans and plays a key role in cytoskeletal assembly and disassembly events . Two such actin binding proteins are cofilin and Aip1p , which work together to facilitate filament disassembly . Cofilin severs actin filaments , an action enhanced by actin interacting protein 1 ( Aip1p ) through mechanisms that are not well understood . Normal regulation of filament disassembly is important for cell proliferation and migration . In vivo data obtained by lab colleagues reveal that , in the absence of Aip1p , cells have abnormal cytoskeleton and organelle morphologies and poor growth . This thesis summarizes the investigation into the regulation of R256H mutant actin by Aip1p . S . cerevisiae was used to express R256H actin as the sole actin in the cell , and the effect of the mutation was assessed in vitro . The mutant actin exhibited decreased thermal stability indicative of an effect on monomer integrity . Filament stability was also affected as evidenced by aberrant polymerization kinetics , and high critical concentration and phosphate release rates . While the mutant actin was more sensitive to cofilin - mediated severing , it was less sensitive to disassembly in the presence of Aip1p with incomplete oligomer breakdown at varying Aip1p v concentrations . Collectively , these data suggest an alteration in the filament in the presence of the R256H mutation that interferes with proper actin - Aip1p interaction . The biochemical effects observed with this mutant suggest how its presence leads to α - SM cytoskeletal disorganization and TAAD . vi TABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF FIGURES . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . viii LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ix CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Overview of Thesis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 CHAPTER II MATERIALS AND METHODS . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 Construction of Mutant Yeast Strains . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 Actin Purification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 Yeast Cofilin Expression and Purification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 Yeast Aip1p Expression and Purification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 Actin Polymerization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 Critical Concentration Cetermination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 Phosphate Release . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 Circular Dichroism Measurements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 ε -

TAAD is a difficult disorder to diagnose due to an absence of symptoms until a dissection occurs ( 1 - 3 ) . While it can occur alongside other cardiovascular diseases , 20 % of patients inherit TAAD in an autosomal dominant fashion ( 1 , 4 ) . Since TAAD is a disease of variable penetrance , it is difficult to track and is commonly discovered upon clinical admittance of patients with other cardiovascular problems ( 1 ) . Mutations in the ACTA2 gene are the most common genetic cause of TAAD and account for 15 % of inherited cases ( 5 ) . ACTA2 encodes alpha smooth muscle ( α - SM ) actin , and mutations in this gene have been attributed to additional acquired and congenital cardiovascular diseases such as patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) , stroke and premature coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ( 6 ) . The aortic wall has three layers . The middle layer , termed the tunica media , is populated by vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) ( 1 ) . The actin cytoskeleton within VSMCs is organized into dense bodies , providing smooth muscle cell structures that function to properly position VSMCs with respect to force transduction , blood flow and maintaining blood vessel diameter ( 7 ) . α - SM actin is the most abundant protein found in VSMCs , constituting 70 % of the total actin , with β - and γ - non - muscle actin constituting the remaining 30 % ( 8 ) . α - SM actin plays a major role in VSMC proliferation , force transduction and integrity of the cell wall ( 9 ) . Patients with TAAD exhibit disorganization and loss of aortic VSMCs in addition to fewer α - SM actin cables observed within the cells from excised specimens ( 5 , 10 ) . Currently , there are more than 30 known ACTA2 mutations that have been identified to cause TAAD ( 11 ) . To understand how these α - SM actin mutations lead to the development of TAAD , it is important to understand the biochemical effects they have on actin function . 2 Actin is a 42 kDa protein that exists in both monomer ( G - actin ) and filament ( F - actin ) forms with a nucleotide binding cleft specific for binding ATP and a divalent cation . The actin monomer consists of four subdomains : subdomains 1 and 3 located at the barbed end , and subdomains 2 and 4 located at the pointed end . The polarity of the actin filament also translates to the monomer ( 12 - 14 ) ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . Polymerization requires three to four ATP - bound monomers to come together in an energetically unfavorable reaction , known as nucleation . Filament elongation then takes place with monomers added to both the barbed and pointed ends . However , monomers are preferentially added to the barbed end of the growing filament depending on the critical concentration of the actin , which is the minimum concentration of monomers required for polymerization ( 12 ) . During polymerization , the slow release of inorganic phosphate ( P i ) is matched by the addition of ATP - bound monomers to the barbed end and release of ADP - bound monomers from the pointed end . During the treadmilling phase at steady - state , the filament balances assembly and disassembly . An actin filament is comprised of two actin strands that coil around each other in a double - helical fashion . Within the helix , the actin filament has numerous monomer - monomer contacts ( 12 , 13 , 15 ) . Of the more than 30 mutations in α - SM actin ( Figure 1 . 2 ) , the focus of this project is the R256H mutation ( R258H in humans ; the yeast numbering system will be used throughout this document ) . This mutation is of particular interest due to its proximity and location at the interface of both F - actin strands ( Figure 1 . 3 ) . Mutations can disrupt the inter - monomer contacts or cause propagated conformational changes in the monomer to affect filament stability and function . This project focuses on assessing the biochemical effects of the R256H mutation on actin stability and dynamics . Understanding the effects that the R256H mutation has on the actin monomer can provide insight into the stability of both the monomer and filament . Insight into how a mutation can alter biochemical properties such as monomer integrity 3 and filament dynamics will result in a further understanding of how this actin mutation might lead to this potentially fatal cardiovascular disease . The R256H mutation is the third most common ACTA2 mutation leading to the development of TAAD ( 11 ) . The clinical phenotype found with this mutation includes aneurysm and dissection of the ascending aorta , patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) and the highest incidence of stroke of the known ACTA2 mutations ( 5 , 11 ) . A biochemical analysis of both monomer and filament effects of this mutation provide a basis for understanding how actin mutations might play a role in disease development . However , actin mutations can also alter regulation by actin binding proteins , which facilitate actin assembly and disassembly , a breakdown in which may contribute to disease pathologies . Two regulatory proteins have critical roles in facilitating actin filament disassembly , cofilin and actin - interacting protein 1 ( Aip1p ) ( 16 - 21 ) . Cofilin is a well - characterized 16 kDa actin binding protein that is a key regulator of filament disassembly through the severing of F - actin ( 22 - 24 ) . Cofilin binds at the monomer - monomer interface of the filament where it induces a twist in the filament conformation , resulting in severing ( 23 - 27 ) . This severing plays a major role in the ability of a cell to proliferate and migrate through regulation of actin assembly and disassembly events . VSMC migration is critical in response to vascular injury , and a recent study reveals that cofilin plays a major role in regulating VSMC migration ( 7 ) . Therefore , cofilin could be important in maintaining aortic integrity through its key role in actin flux via regulation of VSMC migration ( 7 ) . The location of R256H in proximity to the cofilin binding site on the actin filament suggests that this mutation could disrupt the actin - cofilin interaction through structural alterations within the filament , causing a breakdown in cofilin regulation of actin assembly / disassembly . Aip1p is a 67 kDa actin binding protein that also regulates filament disassembly through enhancement of cofilin activity , but it is a protein that has been minimally - characterized . Mutation analyses indicate that the binding site of Aip1p on the actin 4 monomer involves subdomain 4 , where the R256 residue is located , while the C - terminus binds on the outer portion of subdomain 1 ( 28 , 29 ) . However , the exact mechanisms of Aip1p function and how it specifically interacts with cofilin remain unclear . While cofilin alone can sever actin filaments , the extent of severing is increased in the presence of Aip1p ( 16 , 18 , 21 , 28 ) . Following the initial severing by cofilin , Aip1p facilitates further breakdown of actin oligomers into monomers ( 19 ) . Deletion of Aip1p ( ΔAip1p ) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae decreases the cofilin - mediated severing of actin filaments ( 18 , 21 ) . Ideally , filament instability observed in mutant actin might be compensated for by decreasing the extent of filament turnover within the cell . However , data obtained by others in the lab using S . cerevisiae reveal that ΔAip1p cells expressing the R256H mutation exhibit decreased growth under both normal and stress conditions , such as varied temperatures and a hyperosmolar environment , compared to cells expressing wild - type actin as well as cells expressing R256H actin that contain Aip1p . These findings suggest that R256H cell growth is more sensitive than wild - type cells to the decrease in actin flux . Further investigation into the biochemical effects of the R256H mutation on actin regulation by cofilin and Aip1p would give much needed insight into the individual and synergistic functions of these two actin binding proteins . To understand the mechanisms by which actin mutations lead to vascular disease , improved knowledge of mutation - specific biochemical effects is needed . However , studying mutations in α - SM actin poses a problem as it is difficult to obtain aortic samples from patients . Additionally , the presence of the three unresolvable isoforms of actin in VSMCs , β - and γ - non - muscle actin in addition to αSM actin , would interfere with obtaining pure mutant isoform preps . An ideal system for mutational analyses is the budding yeast , S . cerevisiae , which is often used to study actin function . Yeast actin , encoded by the ACT1 gene , is 86 % homologous to human α - smooth muscle actin ( 30 ) . The single actin isoform and evolutionary conservation of actin function and dynamics between yeast and mammals , including regulatory partners such as cofilin and Aip1p , 5 validate S . cerevisiae as an established model system for actin studies . In addition , it is the only system that allows for coordinated in vitro and in vivo analyses of actin function due to the high yield of actin obtained from purification preps for in vitro studies , as well as providing a cell system for in vivo analysis . The residue of interest in this study , R256 , is conserved in yeast . Therefore , this mutation can be introduced into the yeast actin gene via site - directed mutagenesis to express the R256H actin as the sole actin isoform . This allows for efficient analysis of specific TAAD - related mutations without interference of additional actin isoforms . Overview of Thesis Investigation of few of the α - SM actin mutations associated with TAAD showed that they caused biochemical and cytological defects ( 5 , 10 , 31 ) . For example , immunofluorescence analyses of the TAAD mutations , T351N and R116Q , from isolated human VSMCs reveal diminished polymerized α - SM actin fibers that failed to extend across the cell body ( 5 ) . Biochemically , the R116Q mutation , along with N115T , have been assessed in S . cerevisiae , and both exhibit pronounced defects in monomer integrity and filament stability ( 31 ) . VSMCs have been isolated from the aortic wall of patients presenting the R256H mutation , and immunohistochemistry reveals a lack of organized α - SM actin ( 10 ) ; however , the effects of this mutation remain to be elucidated on a molecular scale . This thesis summarizes the investigation into the biochemical effects that the R256H mutation has on actin dynamics . In the studies described herein , R256H was expressed as the sole actin in S . cerevisiae . To begin , the effects of the mutation on cell growth and cytology were determined and compared to monomer and filament function in vitro . Furthermore , we investigated the effects of the mutation on actin regulation by both cofilin and Aip1p given the lab data showing growth defects in the absence of Aip1p . In total , the data reveal a story of how the R256H mutation alters actin dynamics and regulation . These results provide insight into how an actin mutation might lead to 6 cell - wide defects . These defects could lead to aberrant cell proliferation and migration events . Clinically , VSMCs with this mutation might result in misorganization within the aortic wall of TAAD patients . Complete characterization of each TAAD mutation can provide further knowledge into how disruption of events on a molecular level can collectively result in this fatal disorder .

This model was modified using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 1 . 3 , Schrödinger , LLC . 10 CHAPTER II MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials DNase I ( grade D ) was purchased from Worthington . DE52 DEAE - cellulose was obtained from Whatman . Micro Bio - Spin P - 30 Tris columns and Affi - Gel 10 - activated resin were purchased from Bio - Rad . ATP was purchased from Sigma . 1 , N6 - ethenoadenosine 5′ - triphosphate ( ε - ATP ) , was purchased from Molecular Probes . The QuikChange® site - directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene , and oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies . Yeast cakes for wild type actin preparations were purchased from a local bakery . The plasmid expressing yeast Aip1 ( pDAG27 ) was a generous gift from David Amberg ( SUNY Upstate Medical University , Syracuse , New York ) . All other chemicals were of reagent - grade quality . Construction of Mutant Yeast Strains Mutations were introduced into the centromeric plasmid pRS314 ( 32 ) containing the yeast actin coding sequence driven by the ACT1 promoter using the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer instructions . Plasmids ( with a TRP1 selectable marker ) containing the desired mutations were introduced into a recipient yeast strain containing a deleted chromosomal ACT1 gene and a plasmid expressing wild type actin ( pRSWT , with a URA selectable marker ) . Plasmid shuffling yielded viable haploid strains for each of the mutations . This process involved growing the newly transformed yeast cells in Trp - media to select for the mutant plasmid . Dilutions of cell cultures were then grown on 5 - FOA media ( 5 - fluoroorotic acid ) to counter - select against yeast cells that successfully eliminated the wild - type plasmid ( with a URA selectable marker ) . Cells still containing the wild - type plasmid are unable to grow in 5 - FOA due to an enzyme ( encoded by the Ura gene ) that converts 5 - FOA to the lethal 5 - fluorouracil ( 33 ) . The 11 plasmids containing the mutant constructs were re - isolated from these strains and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation . Actin Purification Wild - type and mutant yeast actin were purified from lysates of frozen yeast cells using a combination of DNase I - agarose affinity chromatography and DEAE - cellulose chromatography . Fractions were collected from the DEAE column , and those containing the highest amount of actin were dialyzed overnight in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 mM ATP pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol ) at 4°C . Actin was concentrated to a final volume of one to two mL using Dextran powder ( average molecular weight 100 , 000 to 200 , 000 Da ) and polymerization was induced at room temperature using F - salts ( 10 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 40 mM MgCl 2 , 1 M KCl , 0 . 1 mM dithiothreitol , and 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) , which was diluted 10 : 1 ( F - salts to actin ) into the final actin solution . Polymerized actin was centrifuged at 75 , 000 rpm for one hour in a Beckman J2 - HS centrifuge using a JA20 rotor , and the resulting pellet was resuspended in G buffer to induce the F - actin back to G - actin form . The G - actin was dialyzed in G buffer over 48 hours at 4°C with three buffer changes then centrifuged at 75 , 000 rpm for 30 minutes to pellet any polymerized actin that still remained post - dialysis . The quality of actin preparations was assessed using 12 % Tris HCl SDS - PAGE gels and Coomassie Blue staining . The concentration of G - actin was determined from the absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 26600 M - 1 cm - 1 . Actin was stored as G - actin in G buffer ( described above ) . All actins were stored at 4 0 C and used within four days of purification . Yeast Cofilin Expression and Purification Yeast GST - cofilin was expressed in Escherichia coli carrying an ampicillin - resistant recombinant construct for the protein according to Lappalainen et al . ( 26 , 34 ) . Cells were grown in Luria broth containing 1 mg / mL ampicillin to select for the plasmid of interest . Cells were centrifuged , lysed in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 12 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol and 5 mM EGTA ) and passed over a GST - Sepharose column . Following a low salt ( lysis buffer ) and high salt wash ( lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl ) , cofilin was eluted into four mL fractions using lysis buffer containing 10 mM reduced glutathione . Fractions were assessed for the presence of protein and any impurities on a 12 % Tris - HCl SDS - PAGE gel . No impurities were detected . Positive fractions were dialyzed overnight in buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM dithiothreitol and 5 mM EGTA ) , then incubated with 80 units of thrombin overnight at 4°C to cleave the GST tag . Thrombin was removed using 160 µL of p - amino benzamidine - agarose and incubating for 30 minutes at 4°C then centrifuging to remove the thrombin . The protein solution was passed back over the GST - Sepharose column , washed with a 1 M salt wash , and 10 mM reduced glutathione buffer ( described above ) was used to elute the cofilin in separate fractions . Aliquots of the fractions were run on a gel as before to assess cleavage of the GST tag . Fractions containing the cleaved cofilin were concentrated using Amicon Ultra 3K Centrifugal Filters , and the concentration of the purified cofilin was determined by absorption at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 14650 M - 1 cm - 1 . Yeast Aip1p Expression and Purification Yeast GST - Aip1p was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli carrying a recombinant construct for the protein according to Amberg et al . ( 21 ) . BL21 Star TM ( DE3 ) One Shot ® cells from Invitrogen were used for protein expression in Terrific Broth Media from Research Products International Corporation . Cells were grown at 37 0 C to an OD 600 of 0 . 3 – 0 . 4 , induced with 0 . 7 mM Isopropyl β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) , and grown overnight at 18 0 C . Cells were centrifuged , and the resulting cell pellets were used for purification . Cells were lysed and centrifuged and the resulting cell lysate was passed over a GST - sepharose column . Aip1p was eluted using glutathione buffer ( 10 mM glutathione , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM dithiothreitol ) , and resulting fractions were digested with thrombin at room temperature . Thrombin was 13 removed using p - amino benzamidine - agarose , and fractions were centrifuged . Supernatant was run on a 10 % Tris HCl - SDS gel to assess digestion . Digested fractions were concentrated and run on a size - exclusion column at 0 . 75 ml / min . Peak fractions were run on a 10 % Tris HCl - SDS gel to determine purity . Actin Polymerization Polymerization of G - actin in a total volume of 120 μl was induced by the addition of MgCl 2 and KCl to final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm , respectively ( F - salts ) . Polymerization at 25°C was monitored by following the increase in light scattering of the sample in a FluoroMax - 3 fluorescence spectrometer outfitted with a computer - controlled thermostat with a four - position multi - sample exchanger ( HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc . ) . The excitation and emission wavelengths were both set to 360 nm with the slit widths set at 1 nm . All polymerization experiments were performed at least twice with at least two different actin preparations . Critical Concentration Determination To measure the critical concentration ( C c ) for polymerization of each actin , the net change in light scattering of an actin polymerization reaction was measured as a function of increasing actin concentration . Polymerization of G - actin , at concentrations between 1 µM and 4 . 8 µM , was induced by the addition of F - salts and monitored by light scattering . Average G - actin light scattering values were subtracted from F - actin light scattering values and the resulting data were plotted against the actin concentration . The critical concentration of actin was obtained by fitting the points to a linear regression trendline and determining its intersection on the x - axis . Phosphate Release The rate of P i release from polymerizing actin samples following ATP hydrolysis was assessed using the commercially available EnzChekTM phosphate assay ( Invitrogen ) at 25 °C . Briefly , this spectrophotometric assay utilizes the purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) - dependent phosphorolysis of 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7 - methylpurine 14 riboside ( MESG ) to ribose 1 - phosphate and 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7 - methylpurine , the latter of which has a characteristic absorbance at 360 nm that is not shared by the nucleotide substrate at pH values greater than 6 . 5 . An increase in P i concentration during polymerization directly corresponds to an increase in 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7 - methylpurine which can be quantitated as an increase in absorbance . Following induction of polymerization of 4 . 8 µM actin , the absorbance was monitored as a function of time , with readings at 360 nm taken automatically at 10 s intervals using a thermostatted cuvette holder set to 25 °C ± 0 . 1 °C ( 35 ) . The change in absorption allows quantitation of P i consumed in the reaction . The concentration of P i released during polymerization was plotted as a function of time and the slope of the line during each phase of polymerization corresponds to the P i release rate during that respective phase . Circular Dichroism Measurements The apparent melting temperatures of wild type and mutant actins were determined using circular dichroism by following the change in ellipticity of the G - actin sample at 222 nm as a function of temperature between 25 and 90°C at intervals of 1°C ( 32 ) . Measurements were made on an Aviv 62 DS spectropolarimeter . Data were fit to a two - state model , and the apparent T m value was determined by fitting the data to the Gibbs - Helmholtz equation to approximate the temperature at which 50 % of the actin was denatured . ε - ATP Exchange The ability of G - actin to exchange bound nucleotide was assessed by first depleting the actin of unbound ATP using Micro Bio - Spin TM 6 Chromatography Columns ( 6 kDa cutoff ) and centrifuging at 1 , 000 x g at 4°C . A five - fold molar excess of a fluorescently labeled ATP analog ( ε - ATP ) was added to the actin and the solution was allowed to incubate overnight at 4°C . Excess ε - ATP was removed using the same method described above , and the actin concentration was determined using UV spectrometry at a wavelength of 290 nm . A 33 - fold excess of standard ATP was added to 15 the ε - ATP - bound actin and the rate of the monomer exchange of ε - ATP for ATP was measured as a decrease in fluorescence over time using a FluoroMax ( Jobin Yvon Inc . , Edison , NJ ) . Exchange rates were determined by fitting the data to a single exponential expression using BioKine Version 3 . 1 . Growth Behavior in Liquid Culture Cells were grown in complete liquid YPD medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , and 2 % dextrose ) with 0 . 01 % adenine ( YPAD ) at 30°C on a shaking platform . Growth was determined by diluting an overnight culture of each strain into fresh medium at an initial A600 of 0 . 1 at 600 nm and following growth at 30°C with agitation . The absorbances of the cultures were recorded at 600 nm as a function of time . The actual absorbances were calculated following the appropriate dilutions to lower the cell density to the linear range of the spectrometer . Growth Under Stress Conditions Temperature sensitivity of mutant actin was examined by plating four serial 10 - fold dilutions of the cultures on YPD plates followed by incubation at 24 , 30 , or 37°C . Cell growth was assessed as a function of time . To assess mitochondrial function , cells were grown on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon source . Cultures were plated on YPG medium ( YPD medium with the dextrose replaced with 2 % glycerol ) , and incubated at 30°C . To test for hyperosmolar sensitivity , cells were plated on YPD plus 0 . 5 M and 0 . 9 M NaCl agar plates and incubated at 30°C . Cell Cytology Cell structures were imaged with an Olympus IX81 microscope and a Hamamatsu camera ( Model # C10600 - 10B - H ) . Camera control and image enhancement were performed using Slidebook5 ( 3i Inc . , Denver , Co . ) . The actin cytoskeleton was visualized by fluorescence microscopy after staining fixed cells with rhodamine - phalloidin ( 31 ) . Cytoskeletal morphology was assessed in budding cells when the daughter was less than ½ the size of the mother cell . Out - of - focus light was removed 16 from each section by deconvolution using Slidebook5 . The Z - series of deconvolved images were stacked into a 3D image with ImageJ . Presentation of cell images was done using Adobe Photoshop . All cellular statistical analyses were based on cell counts of > 100 for each sample . Cofilin Titration - F - Actin Polymerization of wild - type and mutant G - actin in a total volume of 120 μl was induced by the addition of F - salts . The change in light scattering due to actin polymerization was recorded with a FluoroLog3 spectrometer ( Jobin Yvon - Spex ) as described above . After steady state was reached , an increasing amount of cofilin was added to the sample , and the cofilin - dependent change in light scattering was recorded . Aip1p Enhancement of Cofilin - Mediated Severing – F - actin Polymerization of wild - type and mutant G - actin in a total volume of 120 μl was induced by the addition of F - salts . Upon reaching steady - state , the same cofilin concentrations used above were titrated into each sample and the change in light scattering recorded . Following cofilin titration , a set ratio of Aip1p was titrated into each sample , and again the change in light scattering was recorded . The ratio of Aip1p utilized was a ratio of 50 : 50 : 1 ( actin : cofilin : Aip1p ) , the physiological ratio previously determined in yeast cells ( 21 ) . This assay was performed using the same FluoroLog3 spectrometer . Varied ratios of Aip1p were also titrated into the actin - cofilin samples described above , at ratios of 100 : 1 , 50 : 1 and 5 : 1 actin - to - Aip1p to assess concentration effects on actin severing in the presence of a set cofilin concentration . Electron Microscopy To visualize actin filament morphology , samples of wild type and mutant actin were deposited onto carbon - coated Formvar grids , negatively stained with 1 % uranyl acetate , and imaged with a JOEL 1230 transmission electron microscope ( University of Iowa Central Electron Microscopy Facility ) equipped with a Gatan UltraScan 1000 CCD 17 2000 _ 2000 - pixel camera . Accelerating voltage of the transmission electron microscope was 100 kV . Image J was used to process the images . Statistical Analysis All data are presented as means ± standard deviation . Results for wild type and mutant actins were compared by using a paired t - test with a p value < 0 . 05 considered significant . 18 CHAPTER III RESULTS Effect of the R256H Mutation on the Actin Monomer In Vitro Thermal Stability To understand the effect of the R256H mutation on basic actin function , the biochemical effects on the actin monomer was first investigated . The integrity of the actin monomer in the presence of the mutation was assessed through thermal stability measurements by measuring the change in circular dichroism as the monomer unfolds as a function of temperature . The apparent melting temperature ( T m ) of mutant actin was 55 ± 2 °C compared to a T m of 61 ± 1 °C for wild - type ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 3 . 1 ) . This data suggests an effect of the mutation on monomer integrity . ATP - Exchange Rates The ability of the monomer to efficiently exchange ATP can be hindered by mutation - specific conformational changes in the nucleotide - binding cleft . Therefore , the ability of the monomer to exchange ATP for ADP is critical to maintaining a properly functioning actin cytoskeleton . To assess the effect of a mutation on this critical monomer function , ATP - exchange rates were measured for wild type and R256H actin . Actin monomers were depleted of excess unlabeled ATP then incubated with fluorescently labeled ε - ATP . The change in fluorescence corresponding to the exchange of ε - ATP from the monomer was measured over time to obtain an exchange rate ( t 1 / 2 ) from the first order reaction . The t 1 / 2 for the mutant actin was 40 ± 2 s compared to 32 ± 4 s for wild - type actin ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 3 . 2 ) . This suggests a slight alteration in the nucleotide binding site within the R256H monomer . Effect of the R256H Mutation on Actin Polymerization The location of R256H at the interfilament interface suggests the possibility of altered actin polymerization kinetics . The polymerization kinetics of mutant actin was 19 measured by monitoring the change in light scattering over time , corresponding to the formation of filaments . Wild - type actin has a rapid nucleation phase that is concentration dependent and is too rapid to observe at the 4 . 8 µM used in this assay . However , the nucleation phase of the R256H mutant actin at 4 . 8 µM is prolonged and lasts 100 seconds ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . The mutant actin final extent revealed a 32 % drop from wild - type ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Collectively , this suggests a defect in the ability of the mutant actin monomers to form the nucleus upon which filament elongation can occur . Not only does the mutant have a nucleation defect , it also has a decreased final extent of polymerized actin , which indicates mutant filament instability . While there is a slight elongation defect observed in R256H actin at 4 . 8 µM compared to wild - type , this difference disappears at higher actin concentrations of 6 . 0 µM . However , the nucleation lag remains , indicating a true defect in this phase of polymerization ( data not shown ) . Effect of the R256H Mutation on Filament Stability In Vitro Critical Concentration A way to define the stability of actin filaments is quantification of the critical concentration ( Cc ) , or the minimum concentration of monomers required for polymerization ( 12 ) . The Cc of the mutant actin was 1 . 3 ± 0 . 2 µM which was three times higher than the wild - type Cc of 0 . 4 ± 0 . 1 µM ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . The higher Cc value of the mutant indicates a less stable filament . P i Release One manifestation of altered monomer - monomer contacts is an increase in filament instability , which would be reflected by an increase in treadmilling of monomers through the filament . Increased treadmilling would result in an increase in P i release rates . The P i release for R256H actin was five times higher than wild - type at 14 . 8 ± 0 . 6 nM / s compared to 3 . 3 ± 0 . 5 nM / s , respectively ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . The high P i 20 release rate observed for the R256H actin indicates an inherent instability within the filament . Effect of R256H on Cytoskeletal Morphology Alterations in actin function or morphology resulting from actin mutations can result in actin misorganization ( 32 ) . As a result , cellular events dependent on a normal actin cytoskeleton , such as proliferation or migration , could be affected . In yeast , the actin cytoskeleton is displayed as polarized cables extending across the mother cell to the daughter cell ( bud ) , which aids in transport of nutrients and organelles . Actin is also located in patches in yeast cells , which serve as cites of endocytosis and are largely confined to the bud ( 36 , 37 ) . The phenotype of a mutant actin cytoskeleton can be investigated through analysis of both cable polarization and distribution of patches . The cellular phenotypes containing the R256H mutant actin were investigated by lab colleagues , with data revealing that 41 % of mutant cells have a lack of polarized patches and cables compared to 6 % of wild - type cells ( Figure 3 . 6A ) [ Alyson Pierick and Lindsey Malloy , Bartlett Lab ] . Cytoskeletal Morphology in ΔAip1p Cells The abnormal cytoskeletal morphologies of R256H cells support an overall cytoskeletal defect . This morphological defect might be rescued by decreasing the system of filament turnover within the cell . Cofilin is a key player in filament severing ; therefore , decreasing cofilin activity may result in improved cytoskeletal morphology . However , deletion of cofilin is lethal in yeast cells . Therefore , elimination of the cofilin enhancer , Aip1p , would result in decreased cofilin - mediated severing without resulting in cell death . ΔAip1p cells expressing wild - type actin showed a slight improvement in cytoskeletal morphology , with 4 % expressing a lack of polarized patches and cables compared to 6 % in cells containing Aip1p . Strikingly , ΔAip1p cells expressing the R256H actin showed a more drastic improvement in cytoskeletal morphologies , with only 21 23 % expressing a lack of polarized patches and cables compared to 43 % in cells containing Aip1p ( Figure 3 . 6B ) [ Alyson Pierick , Barlett Lab ] . Effect of R256H on Cell Growth Due to the abnormal cytoskeletal morphologies observed in the presence of the R256H mutation , the effect of the mutation on cell growth was established ( 38 , 39 ) . Data showed no difference in the doubling time or extent of growth of the R256H cells ( Figure 3 . 7A ) [ Alyson Pierick and Lindsey Malloy , Barlett Lab ] . Cell Growth in the Absence of Aip1p Although there was no difference in cell growth between cells expressing wild - type actin versus R256H actin , the vast improvement in cytoskeletal morphologies observed in ΔAip1p cells expressing R256H actin led to the belief that perhaps a further improvement would be seen in cell growth . While ΔAip1p cells expressing wild - type actin did show slight improvement in final cell growth , ΔAip1p cells expressing the mutant actin showed an increase in doubling - time compared to cells expressing wild - type actin ( 2 . 5 ± 0 . 1 hours and 2 . 2 ± 0 . 1 hours , respectively , p < 0 . 05 ) . Additionally , ΔAip1p cells expressing mutant actin exhibit early growth arrest which resulted in a lower overall final cell density compared to not only ΔAip1p cells containing wild - type actin , but also to cells expressing R256H that contain Aip1p ( Figure 3 . 7B ) [ Alyson Pierick , Bartlett Lab ] . Cell Growth Under Stress Conditions In order for a cell to quickly adapt to a changing environment , it must rely on a properly functioning actin cytoskeleton that is capable of rapid disassembly and reassembly in response to its surroundings . A method for assessing this is to monitor cell growth under a variety of stress conditions , such as varying temperatures and hyperosmolar conditions . Cell growth for cells expressing wild - type actin and cells expressing R256H actin revealed normal growth under all stress conditions ( Figure 3 . 8 ) . 22 Yeast cells require the mitochondrial enzyme , glycerol - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase , to metabolize glycerol for glycolytic purposes ( 40 ) . If mitochondrial function is impaired due to a defective actin cytoskeleton , then glycerol will not be efficiently metabolized . As a result , decreased cell growth would be observed on glycerol - containing medium ( YPG ) . However , data showed no aberrant growth of R256H cells on YPG medium , indicating functional mitochondria ( Figure 3 . 8 ) . ΔAip1p Cell Growth Under Stress Conditions Since abnormal cell growth was observed under normal conditions in ΔAip1p cells expressing R256H actin , the next step was to look at if cell growth was also affected under the same stress conditions listed above . While ΔAip1p cells expressing wild - type actin showed no difference in cell growth compared to cells containing Aip1p , the ΔAip1p expressing R256H actin showed a decrease in cell growth under all conditions , including increased sensitivity to temperature , hyperosmolarity and growth on YPG media ( Figure 3 . 9 ) [ Alyson Pierick , Bartlett Lab ] . Effect of the R256H Mutation on the Actin - Cofilin Interaction Since Aip1p enhances cofilin activity and altered growth is observed in R256H cells in the absence of Aip1p , this suggests altered cofilin regulation of the mutant actin . Therefore , the severing of both wild - type and R256H actin by cofilin was assessed using the same light scattering assay described previously for actin polymerization . To account for the differences in critical concentration , equivalent amounts of polymerizable actin were used . Reactions containing 4 . 8 µM wild - type or 6 . 0 µM R256H actin were induced to polymerize , then varied concentrations of yeast cofilin ranging from 0 µM to 20 µM were added . The change in final extent of polymerization was measured . For wild type actin , cofilin decorates filaments at an actin - to - cofilin ratio of 1 : 1 with a dose dependent increase in severing occurring beyond the 1 : 1 . 6 ratio ( Figure 3 . 10 ) . Near total disassembly of wild - type filaments occurs at and beyond an actin - to - cofilin 23 ratio of 1 : 4 . 2 . As anticipated , mutant actin is more sensitive to cofilin - mediated severing . Severing of the mutant filaments occurs just beyond an actin - to - cofilin ratio of 1 : 1 with light scattering values remaining 10 to 15 % lower than that of wild - type ( Figure 3 . 10 ) . Effect of the R256H Mutation on Aip1p - Enhanced Severing of Filaments Aip1p - Enhanced Cofilin Activity Due to the altered R256H cell growth observed in vivo in the absence of Aip1p , as well as the increased sensitivity of the mutant actin to cofilin - mediated severing , the extent of severing in the presence of Aip1p was next investigated . As described above , reactions containing equal concentrations of actin and cofilin were polymerized in a 1 : 1 ratio . When polymerization had reached final extent , Aip1p was added and the change in final extent was quantified . The concentration of Aip1p utilized reflected the known cellular ratio of cofilin - to - actin - to - Aip1p , specifically 50 : 50 : 1 , which was determined from yeast cell extracts ( 21 ) . While wild - type actin - cofilin samples demonstrated a consistent decrease in light scattering post - Aip1p addition , R256H actin showed less sensitivity to Aip1p ( Figure 3 . 11 ) . At the 1 : 1 actin - cofilin ratio , the physiological ratio in yeast cells , mutant actin shows 20 % less sensitivity to Aip1p than wild - type actin ( Figure 3 . 11 ) . This study was extended further to include a range of Aip1p concentrations resulting in different actin - to - Aip1p ratios , all in the presence of 1 : 1 actin - to - cofilin . Aip1p was titrated into each actin - cofilin sample to result in final actin - to - Aip1p ratios of 100 : 1 , 50 : 1 and 5 : 1 ( Figure 3 . 12 ) . The R256H actin was less sensitive than wild - type actin at all ratios of Aip1p . The titration results did not follow the regular linear relationship that was expected upon increasing Aip1p concentrations . Therefore , electron microscopy was utilized to clarify the titration data . Micrographs were taken of 4 . 8 µM wild - type and 6 . 0 uM mutant actin alone ( the same F - actin concentration ) , with 6 . 0 µM cofilin ( 1 : 1 F - actin - 24 to - cofilin ) , 100 : 1 , 50 : 1 , and 5 : 1 actin - to - Aip1p ( all Aip1p ratios are in the presence of 6 . 0 uM cofilin ) . Images reveal filaments for both wild - type and R256H actin in the actin - only samples ( Figure 3 . 13 , Panel A ) , while cofilin - decorated filaments are observed for mutant vs . wild - type actin in the presence of 1 : 1 F - actin - to - cofilin ( Figure 3 . 13 , Panel B ) . The mutant actin shows small oligomers present at both the 100 : 1 and 50 : 1 actin - to - Aip1p ratios ( Figure 3 . 13 , Panels C and D , respectively ) . Interestingly , the 5 : 1 actin - to - Aip1p ratio appears to produce aggregates with different morphologies than wild - type actin , which could explain the increase in light scattering observed at this ratio ( Figure 3 . 13 , Panel E ) . Enlarged images of the 5 : 1 actin - to - Aip1p micrograph is presented for clearer viewing ( Figure 3 . 14 , Panel A ) , and the 50 : 1 actin - to - Aip1p images are provided for comparison ( Figure 3 . 14 , Panel B ) . These findings further support the in vitro data indicating decreased sensitivity of mutant actin to Aip1p - enhanced severing in the presence of cofilin . 25 Figure 3 . 1 . Effect of the R256H mutation on thermal stability of the actin monomer . Circular dichroism was used to measure the apparent melting temperatures ( T m ) of wild type and R256H actin monomers . The T m for R256H actin was 6°C lower than wild type ( p < 0 . 05 ) . See Figures A . 1 and A . 2 for actual data points containing best - fit lines . 26 Figure 3 . 2 . Effect of the R256H mutation on ATP - exchange . The flexibility of the monomer can be assessed through ATP - exchange rates , which can provide insight into the ease with which the monomer can open and close to expose the nucleotide - binding cleft ( 12 - 14 ) . The rate of ATP - exchange was calculated from the change in fluorescence emission upon release of ε - ATP . Wild - type monomers had an ATP - exchange rate of 32 ± 4 s , while mutant monomers had a slightly slower ATP - exchange rate of 40 ± 2 s . 27 Figure 3 . 3 . Effect of the R256H mutation on polymerization kinetics . The polymerization of 4 . 8 µM wild - type and mutant actin was assessed following initiation by the addition of F - salts as described under “Materials and Methods” . The change in light scattering was monitored over time at room temperature and a pH of 7 . 5 . Shown are representative plots of experiments performed at least three times over three independent actin preparations . Mutant actin exhibits a prolonged nucleation phase ( designated by the arrow ) , followed by elongation , then final extent , which is 30 % lower than wild - type actin . 28 Figure 3 . 4 . Effect of the R256H mutation on critical concentration . A measurement of both polymerization kinetics and filament stability can be accomplished via critical concentration ( Cc ) , the minimum concentration of actin monomers required for polymerization . The increase in light scattering upon polymerization was monitored as a function of increasing actin concentration . The Cc of actin was determined by drawing a line through the points and determining the intersection at the X - axis . Wild - type actin had a Cc of 0 . 4 ± 0 . 1 µM while mutant actin had a Cc four times higher than that of wild - type at 1 . 3 ± 0 . 2 µM . Error bars indicate standard deviations . Differences were statistically significant compared to wild - type actin at p < 0 . 05 . 29 Figure 3 . 5 . Effect of the R256H mutation on P i release . The rate of P i release during the treadmilling phase of steady - state polymerization was quantified as described in “Materials and Methods” . Shown above is the concentration of P i released over time during the entire course of polymerization ( blue ) overlapping the respective polymerization curve ( black ) . The P i release for wild - type actin was 3 . 3 ± 0 . 5 nM / s and R256H actin was 14 . 8 ± 0 . 6 nM / s , p < 0 . 05 . 30 A . B . Figure 3 . 6 .

The doubling - time , designated by the rapid growth phase over the first 24 hours , was the same with wild - type and mutant cells both doubling over 2 . 3 ± 0 . 1 hours ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The final cell density at 70 hours also revealed no differences [ Alyson Pierick and Lindsey Malloy , Bartlett Lab ] . B . The same growth curve outlined above was repeated for ΔAip1p cells expressing either wild - type or R256H actin . Doubling - time for both varied at 2 . 2 ± 0 . 1 hours and 2 . 5 ± 0 . 1 hours ( p < 0 . 05 ) for ΔAip1p cells expressing wild - type or mutant actin , respectively . There was also an early growth arrest in ΔAip1p cells expressing the mutant actin , resulting in a decrease in final cell density [ Alyson Pierick , Bartlett Lab ] . 32 Figure 3 . 8 .

Wild - type and mutant actin cells were expressed on solid medium with either 2 % dextrose ( YPD at 30 , 24 and 37 °C ) , in the presence of 0 . 5 or 0 . 9 M NaCl , or 2 % glycerol ( YPG ) as the sole carbon source . Cell cultures were diluted and spotted onto YPD or glycerol - containing agar plates and grown at 30 °C unless otherwise specified . Growth was monitored and images taken at 48 hours . Cell growth was normal under all conditions with no significant growth differences observed for the mutant cells . 33 Figure 3 . 9 .

Wild - type and mutant actin were expressed in ΔAip1p : pRSWT host cells on solid medium with either 2 % dextrose ( YPD at 30 , 24 and 37 °C ) , in the presence of 0 . 5 or 0 . 9 M NaCl , or 2 % glycerol ( YPG ) as the sole carbon source . Cell cultures were diluted and spotted onto YPD or glycerol - containing agar plates and grown at 30 °C unless otherwise specified . Mutant cells demonstrated decreased cell growth under every condition , including the normal growth temperature of 30°C . Compared to the growth under stress conditions in a wild - type background presented in Figure 3 . 3 , aberrant mutant cell growth is apparent in a ΔAip1p background [ Alyson Pierick , Bartlett Lab ] .

Once the samples reached steady - state , a range of yeast cofilin concentrations was added to the samples , and the change in light scattering was recorded . Data were normalized to the maximum light scattering value . The average light scattering value is plotted relative to the cofilin concentration . Mutant actin showed higher sensitivity to cofilin severing at cofilin concentrations beyond 6 µM compared to wild - type severing beyond cofilin concentrations of 8 µM . Error bars indicate standard deviations . 35 Figure 3 . 11 . Effect of the R256H mutation on cofilin - mediated severing of filaments in the presence of Aip1p .

Once the samples reached a final extent , a range of yeast cofilin concentrations was added to the samples , and the change in light scattering was recorded . Upon reaching final extent after cofilin addition , Aip1p was added at a ratio of 50 : 1 actin - to - Aip1p and the change in light scattering was recorded . While wild - type actin showed increased sensitivity to cofilin - mediated severing in the presence of Aip1p , mutant actin showed a decrease in sensitivity at cofilin concentrations over 4 . 8 µM , specifically at 6 µM cofilin . Error bars indicate standard deviations . 36 Figure 3 . 12 . Effect of varied concentrations of Aip1p on mutant actin filaments in the presence of cofilin . A total of 6 µM yeast cofilin was titrated into the same F - actin concentrations of wild - type and mutant actin .

The change in light scattering was monitored over time . The final light scattering values ( y - axis ) of wild - type and mutant actin after 6 µM cofilin and select Aip1p ratios ( x - axis ) were quantified and are displayed in this figure . Mutant actin is less sensitive to cofilin - mediated severing at all three actin - to - Aip1p ratios . Error bars indicate standard deviations .

W T 40 CHAPTER IV DISCUSSION The data outlined in this project addresses the role of the R256H mutation on actin function and dynamics through both in vivo and in vitro assays . The results provide a starting point for understanding the biochemical effects of actin mutations that are associated with vascular disorders such as TAAD . The R256H mutation causes filament instability as evidenced by the high critical concentration , rate of ATP exchange and rate of polymerization - associated P i release . Other disease - causing mutations that have been studied , such as the α - SM actin mutations N115T and R116Q that cause TAAD , and the γ - non - muscle - actin mutations K118M , T278I , P332A and V370A that cause deafness , are also associated with similar defects ( 32 , 34 ) . The R256H mutation also alters polymerization kinetics . The nucleation lag coupled with a high critical concentration indicates a deficiency in the ability of the mutant actin to initiate polymerization . This defect may contribute to the cytoskeletal defects seen in the mutant yeast strain and human pathology samples . Although filament instability may be a contributing mechanism to actin - mediated human disease , the mutation - specific clinical phenotypes may also be due to changes in regulation by actin binding proteins . The location of the R256H mutation at the interstrand interface in the actin filament suggests that the mutation can affect both these parameters ( 12 , 13 ) . The actin binding protein , cofilin , preferentially binds ADP - bound actin , inducing a twist in the filament to induce severing , providing short actin oligomers upon which actin reassembly can occur ( 16 - 18 , 21 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 28 ) . This control of actin flux regulates cell migration and proliferation . The data indicate that R256H mutant actin has increased sensitivity to cofilin - mediated severing . Cofilin has been shown to play a key role in the migration of VSMCs through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge of the cell following vascular injury ( 7 ) . Therefore , misregulation by 41 cofilin could contribute to the VSMC disorganization found in diseased aortic tissue from patients carrying the R256H mutation . The mechanism for misregulation by cofilin may be due to conformational changes in the binding site on the filament . The direct binding site of cofilin involves regions of subdomain 1 of one monomer and subdomain 2 of the adjacent monomer within the same strand ( 23 , 24 , 27 , 28 ) . Although the R256 residue is not directly located within the cofilin binding site , a mutation of this residue can induce a conformational change in the filament as such would interfere with efficient cofilin binding . The increased instability observed in R256H mutant actin and the potential conformational change induced by this mutation could contribute to filament strain , thereby accelerating the severing process . The crux of the story that lies behind the altered cofilin interaction with R256H actin involves the cofilin enhancer , Aip1p . Importantly , the R256 residue is located at the Aip1p binding site ( 21 ) . Although little is known about Aip1p outside of its ability to enhance cofilin activity , subdomain 4 has been identified to be important for Aip1p binding through genetic mutation screens ( 21 ) . A mutation in this subdomain could result in disruption of proper actin - Aip1p interaction . While wild - type actin displays a slight increase in cell growth in the absence of Aip1p due to decreased cofilin - mediated filament severing , the mutant has significant growth defects . This finding opposes previous data obtained from TAAD mutations depicting an improvement in cell growth in the absence of Aip1p ( 31 ) . The decreased growth observed in R256H mutant cells in the absence of Aip1p suggests a dependence on the cofilin enhancer in a certain capacity . However , a biochemical analysis of the mutant actin in the presence of cofilin and Aip1p was required to understand how the mutation may alter regulation by these two actin binding proteins . The response of R256H actin to cofilin - mediated severing in the presence of Aip1p in vitro provides further insight . At physiological actin - to - Aip1p ratios , the 42 mutant is less sensitive to severing in the presence of cofilin and this persists at higher and lower ratios . This offers a perspective as to what could be occurring conformationally in the actin - cofilin - Aip1p interaction . Even at higher Aip1p concentrations , R256H mutant actin has incomplete oligomer disassembly by cofilin and Aip1p . This is evidenced by the electron micrographs of actin filaments . Wild - type actin has no visible oligomeric structures and only small aggregates can be seen ; however , R256H actin has short filament structures consistent with oligomers . Strikingly , high concentrations of Aip1p result in what appear to be morphologically abnormal aggregates in the mutant actin following cofilin - mediated severing . These images are consistent with the in vitro polymerization data showing that mutant actin is less sensitive to severing by cofilin and Aip1p . The R256H mutation could induce a conformational change within the actin filament that results in either Aip1p binding the actin oligomers in such a way that cofilin is unable to properly bind and / or induce further severing . Consequently , build - up of unsevered oligomers would interfere with proper cofilin - mediated actin flux within the cell , making it difficult for reassembly to occur in order to drive proper cell growth and migration . In light of this data , one would expect an improvement in cell growth in the absence of Aip1p for the R256H mutant . However , this is not the case . Perhaps the aberrant growth phenotype observed in ΔAip1p mutant cells is part of a larger system at work rather than a single actin binding protein , such as cofilin or Aip1p . Considering that the in vitro data reveals incomplete oligomer breakdown of R256H actin in the presence of Aip1p , perhaps Aip1p also functions to stabilize and protect the mutant actin from further degradation by other proteins within the cell . While this is not the case with wild - type actin , perhaps the R256H mutation results in a structural change within the filament that makes this degradation a possibility if Aip1p is not there to stabilize and protect it . As a result , the aberrant growth observed in ΔAip1p mutant cells would be the expected phenotype . Aip1p may also play a key role cofilin - mediated migration of 43 VSMCs through enhancement of cofilin activity . Importantly , the clinical significance of the R256H mutation in the development of TAAD may partially lie in the aberrant interaction observed with Aip1p presented in this study . Ultimately , this would result in a disorganization of VSMCs within the aortic wall and , eventually , development of TAAD . To better understand the effects observed in vivo and in vitro , it is important to consider this mutation on a molecular scale . The R256 residue is located at a position in the monomer that supports adjacent residues at the interfilament interface . If a mutation such as R256H is introduced at this position within the filament , monomer - monomer contacts within the filament strands may be disrupted . At the interface of the two actin strands within the filament , the R256 residue appears to form an ionic bridge with E195 of the same monomer ; additionally , the K113 residue of the adjacent monomer also appears to form an ionic bridge with E195 ( Figure 4 . 1 ) . Mutation of the R256 residue to R256H may potentially increase the ionic interaction between K113 and E195 due to a loss of charge of the R256 residue , leading to a decrease in overall filament stability ( Figure 4 . 1 ) . Directly altering the K113 and E195 bond produces similar effects on filament stability as those observed with the R256H mutation [ Wen , unpublished ] . The downstream effects of this mutation likely affect the contour of the filament , which would interfere with both cofilin and Aip1p regulation . For example , wild - type oligomers are further disassembled by cofilin in the presence of Aip1p ( 19 ) , most likely with cofilin and Aip1p dissociating following this process ; however , R256H actin may result in a conformational defect as such that cofilin is unable to properly disassemble oligomers due to aberrant binding by Aip1p ( Figure 4 . 2 ) . Further investigation is required to understand what is occurring within the mutant cells in the absence of Aip1p and why aberrant growth is observed in vivo . One option would be to assess colocalization of cofilin and Aip1p in yeast cells in the presence of the R256H mutation . A previous study has shown that Aip1p and cofilin 44 localize to patches in yeast cells , the primary sites of endocytosis , where actin flux is high ( 18 ) . In yeast , cofilin mislocalizes to actin cables in the absence of Aip1p which highlights the interrelationship of these two proteins in actin regulation ( 18 ) . To further elucidate the effects observed in vitro with the actin - to - Aip1p ratios , cosedimentation is needed to fully quantitate these effects . Additionally , the binding affinity of Aip1p for R256H actin needs to be determined in order to understand the binding relationship with the mutant actin vs . wild - type . Elucidating the biochemical mechanisms underlying the disorganization of VSMCs within the aortic wall will provide insight into the development of TAAD on a molecular scale . Understanding the impact of actin mutations on actin function and their resulting effects on regulation by actin binding proteins will help determine how these mutations disrupt cellular function and organization , thereby leading to TAAD pathology . While there is insufficient information known about the individual role of Aip1p or the synergistic role of both cofilin and Aip1p in VSMC migration , more knowledge on both fronts will advance the knowledge of disease mechanisms not only for TAAD but potentially other actin - mediated diseases . Utilization of the assays outlined in this project with other TAAD mutations will lead to a better understanding of the development of this disorder and provide a basis for further research into diagnosis and potential treatments . A . B . 45 Figure 4 . 1 . The R256H mutation could alter ionic interactions at the interstrand interface . The actin trimer model is based on the filament model by Oda et al . , depicting two actin monomers within one strand ( highlighted cyan and gray ) and a monomer from the opposing strand ( highlighted red ) ( 13 ) . A . The R256 residue is highlighted purple , E195 in the same monomer is highlighted blue , and K113 in the opposing monomer is highlighted yellow . The ionic bridge involving R256 and E195 most likely fosters the integrity of the monomer - monomer interface . B . The R256H mutation might result in a decrease in this integrity through disruption of the ionic bridge . This model was modified using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 1 . 3 , Schrödinger , LLC . 46 Figure 4 . 2 A model of altered regulation of R256H actin by Aip1p and cofilin . A . Model of wild - type filament severing in the presence of cofilin and Aip1p . Cofilin can bind and sever actin filaments in the absence of Aip1p , albeit at lower efficiency . In the presence of Aip1p , cofilin - mediated severing is increased . Additionally , Aip1p enhances further dissociation of actin oligomers into monomers at which point cofilin and Aip1p are released . B . The R256H actin mutation results in decreased cofilin - mediated severing in the presence of Aip1p . Hypothetically , a conformational change is induced in the mutant actin , which interferes with further severing of actin oligomers . Aberrant binding of Aip1p may play a role in this decreased sensitivity .
