Leading Edge Review Single - Particle Cryo - EM at Crystallographic Resolution Yifan Cheng 1 , * 1 Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics , University of California San Francisco , 600 16th Street , San Francisco , CA 94158 , USA * Correspondence : ycheng @ ucsf . edu http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . cell . 2015 . 03 . 049 Until only a few years ago , single - particle electron cryo - microscopy ( cryo - EM ) was usually not the ﬁrst choice for many structural biologists due to its limited resolution in the range of nanometer to subnanometer . Now , this method rivals X - ray crystallography in terms of resolution and can be used to determine atomic structures of macromolecules that are either refractory to crystallization or difﬁcult to crystallize in speciﬁc functional states . In this review , I discuss the recent break - throughs in both hardware and software that transformed cryo - microscopy , enabling understand - ing of complex biomolecules and their functions at atomic level . A major goal of structural biology is to provide mechanistic understanding of critical biological processes . The most detailed insights come from atomic structures of macromolecules and complexes involved in these processes in relevant functional states . Beyond basic research , obtaining atomic structures of drug targets is also a standard approach in the pharma - ceutical industry in the design and optimization of therapeutic compounds . Prior to 2013 , most atomic structures deposited in the protein data bank ( PDB ) were determined by X - ray crystallography . This technique starts with crystallization of molecules that are homo - geneous in both composition and conformation . Once the 3D crystals are of sufﬁcient size to diffract X - rays , they are used for structure determination . The resolution of crystal structures is largely determined by how well the molecules are ordered ( or aligned to each other ) in the crystal . After 100 years of devel - opment and maturation , X - ray crystallography has become a routine method , delivering a wealth of structural information about important biomolecules and cellular processes ( Jones , 2014 ; Shi , 2014 ) . While X - ray crystallography will continue to play an important role in answering many biological questions , it completely depends on growth of well - ordered 3D crystals . Producing such crystals , however , is a major bottleneck for chal - lenging targets , such as integral membrane proteins of mamma - lian origin or chromatin in complex with its modiﬁers . In the last 2 years , single particle electron cryo - microscopy ( cryo - EM ) has emerged as a technique for determining atomic resolution struc - tures at better than 4 - A˚ resolution , comparable to many solved using crystallographic approaches . It has now determined a number of structures of proteins and complexes that have vexed crystallographers . The Way Electron Cryo - Microscopy Works Rather than determining structures from diffraction of 3D crys - tals , single - particle cryo - EM determines structures by computa - tionally combining images of many individual macromolecules in identical or similar conformations ( Frank et al . , 1978 ) . In this approach , samples of puriﬁed molecules in solution are applied to an EM grid covered with a thin holey carbon ﬁlm and blotted by a ﬁlter paper to remove most of solution so that the a thin liquid layer is formed across the holes in the carbon ﬁlm . This is followed by plunge - frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitro - gen . This method was originally developed by Dubochet and colleagues ( Dubochet et al . , 1982 ) , and improved signiﬁcantly with semi - automated plunge - freezer machine to improve reproducibility . After plunge - freezing , frozen - hydrated mole - cules are embedded in a thin layer of vitreous ice ( Figure 1A ) that preserves the native structure to the atomic level ( Taylor and Glaeser , 1974 ) , prevents dehydration of biological samples within the vacuum of an electron microscope , and reduces the effects of radiation damage ( Stark et al . , 1996 ) . Molecules embedded in a thin layer of vitreous ice adopt a range of orientations , which are then imaged using an electron beam ( Figure 1B ) . Each particle image is a 2D projection of a molecule , whose spatial orientation and position are deﬁned by six geo - metric parameters . These include three Euler angles and two in - plane positional parameters . The sixth parameter is the defo - cus that deﬁnes the z position along the direction of the electron beam and is often assumed to be the same for all particles in a micrograph ( or image ) . After further correction for aberrational errors of the microscope , a 3D structure can be reconstructed by combining images of many molecules that have been aligned to each other . The resolution of the reconstruction is improved iteratively by reﬁning the ﬁrst ﬁve geometric parameters for each particle to high accuracy ( Frank , 1996 ) . The ﬁnal 3D recon - struction is a Coulomb potential density map that can be inter - preted in the same way as electron density maps determined by X - ray crystallography ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . Both X - ray and electron beams cause radiation damage to biological samples . For X - ray diffraction , a larger crystal with coherently packed molecules can tolerate a high total dose and often diffracts to high resolution because more molecules contribute to the diffraction . For single - particle cryo - EM , the to - tal electron dose used to image each molecule is set to a very low 450 Cell 161 , April 23 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . level to preserve structural information at the subnanometer - res - olution level . The consequence of such low - dose imaging is that individual images have a very poor signal - to - noise ratio ( SNR ) . Hence , images from many identical or similar molecules must be averaged to enhance the SNR as well as to provide the different views needed to calculate a 3D reconstruction ( De Rosier and Klug , 1968 ) . Therefore , the total number of particle images used in a reconstruction has a similar signiﬁcance to the size of a 3D crystal . Similarly , the accuracy of image align - ment in single - particle EM is analogous to how well molecules are packed in a 3D crystal . Provided that a sufﬁcient number of images containing high - resolution information are classiﬁed and aligned accurately , sin - gle - particle cryo - EM will produce a 3D reconstruction at atomic resolution . An atomic model can then be built de novo based on ﬁtting the known sequences into the density map from the reconstruction . Furthermore , electron micrographs are real - space images containing both amplitude and phase information . Thus , cryo - EM structure determination does not have a ‘‘phase problem’’ as in X - ray crystallography , but its amplitudes are less accurate than that measured from X - ray diffractions . Resolution Determinants of Single - Particle Cryo - EM Reconstructions Considering the scattering power of electrons versus X - rays , and the amount of information present in an image of a single mole - cule that can be used to determine the precise position and orientation of the molecule , Richard Henderson predicted that single - particle cryo - EM can , in theory , determine atomic - reso - lution structures of biological molecules as small as 100 kDa in molecular weight ( Henderson , 1995 ) . However , there are many Figure 1 . Single - Particle Cryo - EM ( A ) Puriﬁed biological molecules are embedded in a thin layer of vitreous ice , in which they ideally adopt random orientations . The orientations are speciﬁed by the in - plane position parameters , x and y , and three Euler angles a , b , and g , which are reﬁned iteratively to high accuracies . The defocus values of the images are currently often determined separately . ( B ) Typical image of frozen - hydrated archaeal 20S proteasomes . ( C ) 3D reconstruction of the 20S proteasome at 3 . 3 - A˚ resolution . ( D ) Side - chain densities of the map shown in ( B ) are comparable with those seen in maps determined by X - ray crystallography at a similar resolution . practical limitations that resulted in a gap between what physics allows and what can be accomplished by using the existing technologies . Some limitations are related to the intrinsic properties of low - dose imaging of frozen hydrated bio - logical molecules , while others are related to the properties of frozen - hydrated samples used in single - particle cryo - EM ( Typke et al . , 2004 ) . Overcoming these obstacles took many years , but by 2008 , it was possible to achieve resolutions that were sufﬁcient to visualize side - chain densities ( (cid:1) 3 . 8 A˚ ) ( Yu et al . , 2008 ; Zhang et al . , 2008 ) , and to determine the ﬁrst de novo atomic structure ( 3 . 3 A˚ ) of a non - enveloped icosahedral virus ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) . Because of their large sizes and high symmetry , icosahedral virus particles were among the ﬁrst for which high - resolution maps were ob - tained , and now it is quite feasible to determine reconstructions of such samples at resolutions better than 4 A˚ ( Chen et al . , 2009 ; Wolf et al . , 2010 ; Yu et al . , 2011 ) . However , it has been much harder to achieve similar resolutions for molecules that are smaller and / or less symmetric . Nowadays , an electron microscope with 200 kV or 300 kV ac - celeration voltage and a ﬁeld emission gun ( FEG ) electron source can typically deliver images with a resolution of better than 2 A˚ . Therefore , the achievable resolution of single particle cryo - EM is not limited by the resolution power of a modern microscope itself , but rather by the conditions required to image frozen - hydrated biological samples and the unique properties of such samples . Determining a high - resolution 3D reconstruction re - quires that 2D projection images contain sufﬁcient information at both high and low resolutions . The amount of high - resolution information present in images determines the possible ﬁnal res - olution of a 3D reconstruction . However , low - resolution informa - tion , i . e . , image contrast , is also required to visualize particles . Together , they determine how well a homogeneous set of molecules can be computationally selected for averaging , how accurately these images can be aligned , and the total number of images that are required to achieve a certain resolution . For any electron micrographs , both image amplitudes and phases are modulated by the contrast transfer function ( CTF ) of the Cell 161 , April 23 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 451 microscope , which is mostly a sine function with an envelope that reduces the amplitude at high resolution , such as shown in Figure 2C . The overall envelope of the CTF function combines effects from many factors , including the spatial and temporal coherence of the electron beam , specimen motion , the modula - tion transfer function ( MTF ) of the image recording device , and others . The contribution of the spatial coherence to the envelope is also a function of the defocus . A small defocus maximizes the envelope at high resolution but minimizes the CTF at low resolu - tion . Thus , to obtain the best high - resolution signal , an image must be recorded with a small defocus , which results , however , in a poor image contrast . The converse is also true : to obtain good contrast , an image has to be recorded with a relatively large defocus , which reduces , however , the high - resolution signal ( Figure 2 ) . Both low - and high - resolution signalsare further reduced by the MTF of the image - recording device . This is not a serious problem for a radiation - resistant spec - imen . Using a sufﬁcient electron dose , a modern electron micro - scope can image , for example , a single layer of graphene at atomic or near - atomic resolution with good contrast ( Urban , 2011 ) . The weak low - resolution signal is compensated by a high - electron dose , which generates sufﬁcient image contrast . However , this approach is not possible for biological samples , which are sensitive to radiation damage ( Henderson and Glaeser , 1985 ) . To visualize frozen - hydrated biological mole - cules with sufﬁcient contrast , one has to record images with some defocus ( Figures 2A and 2B ) , which causes a reduction in the high - resolution signal ( Figure 2C ) . Hence , imaging frozen - hydrated biological molecules always requires a ﬁne bal - ance between contrast and resolution . Note that such balance is always inﬂuenced by the microscope hardware , such as the spatial coherence of the electron beam , the image recording de - vice , etc . , as well as by the size and symmetry of the molecule being studied . The ﬁrst breakthrough in boosting the resolution of single - particle cryo - EM maps came from the use of FEGs , which generate an electron beam with much better spatial coherence than a thermo - ionic electron source ( Zhou and Chiu , 1993 ) . While FEGs do not change the oscillation of the CTF function , at the same defocus , high - resolution signal is better preserved in images recorded with a microscope equipped with a FEG than with a thermo - ionic electron source . FEGs thus enable struc - ture determinations at subnanometer resolutions for molecules ranging from icosahedral viruses ( Bo¨ttcher et al . , 1997 ; Conway et al . , 1997 ; Zhou et al . , 2000 ) to molecules as small as (cid:1) 300 kDa with mere 2 - fold symmetry ( Cheng et al . , 2004 ) . Manufactures made many efforts to improve microscope performance . State - of - the - art electron microscopes nowadays use constant - power electromagnetic lenses to improve stability , parallel illumination to reduce image phase error induced by beam tilt ( Glaeser et al . , 2011 ) , very high vacuum to reduce water contamination on frozen - hydrated samples loaded into the mi - croscope column , and better computer control for sophisticated and automated microscope tuning and data acquisition ( Sulo - way et al . , 2005 ) , etc . All these features helped to improve the ef - ﬁciency of as well as the resolution achievable by single - particle cryo - EM , and they eventually enabled the ﬁrst de novo atomic structure determination of an icosahedral virus ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) . Large and highly symmetrical particles , such as icosahe - dral viruses , have certain advantages in achieving better resolu - tion by single - particle cryo - EM . They can be imaged with very small defocus to preserve the high - resolution signal while still provide sufﬁcient image contrast . However , the same approach does not work for small molecules . Images of small molecules must be recorded using a much larger defocus , thus trading high - resolution signal for image contrast . The need to use a rela - tively large defocus to generate image contrast was a major obstacle in achieving even subnanometer - resolution maps for proteins smaller than 300 kDa without high symmetry . Over - coming these limitations required new technologies . The simple use of small defocus without any other means to generate sufﬁ - cient image contrast led to featureless images and controversial results ( Henderson , 2013 ; Mao et al . , 2013 ) . Recent Technological Advances in Single - Particle Cryo - EM Some recent technological advances led to a major break - through in achievable resolution , resulting , in a short period of time , in 3 - to (cid:1) 5 - A ˚ - resolution structures of biological molecules ranging from ribosomal particles to integral membrane proteins ( Allegretti et al . , 2014 ; Amunts et al . , 2014 ; Liao et al . , 2013 ; Lu et al . , 2014 ; Vinothkumar et al . , 2014 ) . Some of these structures were determined for proteins with known atomic structures , Figure 2 .

Others were determined ab initio for pro - teins that resisted crystallization for years ( Liao et al . , 2013 ; Lu et al . , 2014 ) . Here , I will brieﬂy summarize the recent technolog - ical advancements and how they enabled a ‘‘resolution revolu - tion’’ ( Ku¨hlbrandt , 2014 ) . Camera Technology Image - recording devices are characterized by the detective quantum efﬁciency ( DQE ) , which describes the signal and noise performance in a digitally recorded image over the spatial fre - quency range ( McMullan et al . , 2009a ; Mooney , 2007 ) . Tradition - ally , EM images were recorded on photographic ﬁlm that was subsequently digitized or with scintillator - based digital cameras , such as charge - coupled device ( CCD ) or complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( CMOS ) cameras . These cameras use a thin layer of phosphor scintillator to convert electron signals to photons , which are coupled through ﬁber optics to the camera sensor . Photographic ﬁlm has a relative poor DQE at low Figure 3 . Direct Electron Detection Camera Enabled Major Breakthroughs in Single Particle Cryo - EM ( A ) An image of frozen hydrated T . acidophilum 20S proteasome recorded using K2 Summit camera with a 300 - kV microscope and a defocus of (cid:1) 0 . 9 m m .

( F ) Same views of the TRPV1 3D reconstruction determined from a dataset collected with a K2 Summit camera . ( A – C ) are reproduced from ( Li et al . , 2013 ) . spatial frequency , leading to poor image contrast . Thus , recording on photo - graphic ﬁlm typically requires imaging at a higher defocus to ensure sufﬁcient contrast for reliable particle picking and accurate image alignment . Scintillator - based cameras have a better low - fre - quency DQE than photographic ﬁlm , resulting in a better image contrast . How - ever , the high - frequency DQE of these cameras is signiﬁcantly poorer than that of ﬁlm , making them less suitable for high - resolution imaging ( Booth et al . , 2006 ; Meyer et al . , 2000 ) . As their name suggests , the new direct electron detection cameras no longer convert electron signals to light signals but detect the electrons directly ( McMullan et al . , 2009b ; McMul - lan et al . , 2009c ) . All commercially available direct detection cameras have signiﬁcantly higher DQEs than photographic ﬁlm and scintillator - based cameras in both the low - and high - resolu - tion regimes ( Li et al . , 2013 ; McMullan et al . , 2014 ; Ruskin et al . , 2013 ) . These cameras typically operate in two distinct modes , the linear charge - integration mode or the electron - counting mode . In the linear mode , charges generated from electrons striking the detector are integrated , while in the counting mode individual electron events are identiﬁed and counted . An advan - tage of operating in the counting mode is that both Landau noise ( i . e . , the ﬂuctuation in energies generated by each electron striking the camera sensor ) and readout noise are removed . Combining direct electron detection with single electron count - ing signiﬁcantly improves the DQE further , particularly at low fre - quencies ( Li et al . , 2013 ) . Electron - counting cameras thus enable recording low - dose cryo - EM images of small particles with much smaller defocus values ( Figure 3A ) , providing a much Cell 161 , April 23 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 453 better balance between the requirements for both image contrast and high - resolution signal ( Li et al . , 2013 ; Liao et al . , 2013 ; Lu et al . , 2014 ) . Another important feature of the newly developed direct detection cameras is their fast frame readout rate . It enables the already low total electron dose used to image biological sam - ples to be fractionated into many subframes . Computational alignment of these subframes before averaging them can correct for motion - induced image blurring , which results from beam - induced image motion and mechanical instability of the spec - imen holder ( Bai et al . , 2013 ; Brilot et al . , 2012 ; Campbell et al . , 2012 ; Li et al . , 2013 ) . The combination of dose fractionation and motion correction greatly improves the efﬁciency of data acquisition , because nearly all images can be corrected to recover high - resolution information ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . It also provides novel means to optimize usage of the total electron dose ( Baker and Rubinstein , 2010 ) . The contrast can be maxi - mized by using a higher total dose and using all frames for par - ticle alignment . However , the later frames that record images of molecules with higher accumulated electron dose and thus more severe radiation damage can later be eliminated or prop - erly down - weighted so as to minimize the effect of radiation damage on the ﬁnal 3D reconstruction ( Li et al . , 2013 ; Scheres , 2014 ) . These novel technologies are now being applied in many cryo - EM laboratories . They marked the beginning of a new era in single - particle cryo - EM , in which atomic structures of a broad range of biological macromolecules can be deter - mined de novo and without crystallization ( Figures 3D – 3F ) . Maximum Likelihood - Based Classiﬁcation A major advantage of single - particle cryo - EM is that it does not require absolute sample homogeneity . Computational image analysis can deal with a certain level of heterogeneity , both conformational and compositional . Such heterogeneity may pre - vent crystallization , but in single - particle EM , particles can be computationally sorted into different classes , some of which may contain relatively homogeneous subsets of particles . Sin - gle - particle cryo - EM datasets consist of 2D projection images . As determining the orientation parameters of these 2D projec - tions is intertwined with the classiﬁcation of a heterogeneous dataset into homogeneous subsets , it is always challenging to distinguish whether different 2D projection images represent different views of the same molecule or views of molecules with different conformations or compositions . While there are many ways to classify particles according to their conformations or functional states , a particularly powerful approach is to use a maximum likelihood - based method for classiﬁcation and reﬁne - ment ( Scheres et al . , 2007 ) . Implementing sophisticated maximum likelihood - based classiﬁcation and reﬁnement algo - rithms ( Sigworth , 1998 ; Sigworth et al . , 2010 ) into user - friendly software packages ( Lyumkis et al . , 2013 ; Scheres , 2010 , 2012 ) made this method easy to use in practice . It has become routine now to classify particle images into different 3D classes , each of which may be amenable to reﬁnement into higher - resolution reconstructions than the global ensemble . The process of 3D classiﬁcation may separate a number of conformations of the molecule being studied , or separate fully intact particles or com - plexes from incomplete , truncated or fragmented complexes , or from those damaged during vitriﬁcation ( Ferna ´ ndez et al . , 2013 ; Liao et al . , 2014 ) . Note that the better image quality provided by direct detection cameras and motion correction enabled suc - cess of these classiﬁcation procedures . Almost all newly pub - lished near - atomic resolution 3D reconstructions , in one way or another , utilized such classiﬁcation procedures . The use of automated data acquisition ( Suloway et al . , 2005 ) with automated particle - picking procedures enables collecting very large datasets with millions of particle images in relatively short periods of time . With large numbers of particles it will be possible to classify particle images with very subtle conforma - tional differences and thus to detect and quantify even subtle conformational states that exist within a population . This has been achieved at somehow moderate resolution ( Fischer et al . , 2010 ) . It is only a matter of resources and time before single - par - ticle cryo - EM is able to provide solution structures of molecules in multiple conformations at near - atomic resolution and to pro - vide quantitative comparisons of population occupancies under different conditions . Single - Particle Cryo - EM Is Complementary to X - Ray Crystallography There are many large protein assemblies and dynamic com - plexes that are difﬁcult or may even be impossible to crystallize . Thus , single - particle cryo - EM has always been viewed as a sup - plementary method to X - ray crystallography for studying such assemblies or complexes , such as clathrin coats ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) , the 26S proteasome ( da Fonseca et al . , 2012 ; Lander et al . , 2012 ; Lasker et al . , 2012 ) , the anaphase promoting com - plex ( Chang et al . , 2014 ; da Fonseca et al . , 2011 ) , and chromatin ﬁbers ( Song et al . , 2014 ) , to name just a few . In these studies , structures were typically determined by single - particle methods to subnanometer resolution . Crystal structures of domains and fragments or sequence - based homology models were then ﬁtted into the cryo - EM density maps by molecular dynamic sim - ulations or other computational methods ( DiMaio et al . , 2015 ; Seidelt et al . , 2009 ; Trabuco et al . , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . Such hybrid approaches made , for example , subnanometer - res - olution structures of integral membrane proteins very meaningful in providing rich structural insights into large membrane protein complexes ( Efremov et al . , 2015 ; Vinothkumar et al . , 2014 ) or for dissecting function - related conformational changes ( Kim et al . , 2014 ; Meyerson et al . , 2014 ) . With the resolution improved to a level sufﬁcient for sequence - based de novo model building , structures determined by single - particle cryo - EM are comparable to those determined from crystals ( Bartesaghi et al . , 2014 ; Li et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , for many difﬁcult crystallographic targets , either because they are refractory to crystallization or difﬁcult to express and purify in sufﬁcient quantities for crystallization , single - particle cryo - EM is becoming the method - of - choice for structure determination . Recent successes in structure determination of mammalian inte - gral membrane proteins clearly demonstrated this capability ( Liao et al . , 2013 ; Lu et al . , 2014 ; Yan et al . , 2015 ; Zalk et al . , 2015 ) . Even for those targets that could be crystallized , it is now feasible to use single - particle cryo - EM to determine high - resolution structures of the targets in speciﬁc functional states or in complexes with co - factors . We can anticipate that such successes will continue rapidly , with many more structures of 454 Cell 161 , April 23 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . various types of biological molecules being determined to near - atomic resolution . Besides large complexes such as ribosome and icosahedral viruses , integral membrane proteins or mem - brane protein complexes will be a major area in which single - par - ticle cryo - EM will play a role that is equally signiﬁcant as X - ray crystallography . Another class of targets that is difﬁcult to crys - tallize but suitable for single - particle cryo - EM is chromatin in complex with its modiﬁers , which is essential for understanding the complexities of gene expression . Progress of crystallo - graphic studies in this area has been slow with only a few atomic structures available for nucleosomes alone or in complex with modiﬁers , each having led to major discoveries in chromatin biology ( Cramer , 2014 ) . Recent work , although still limited to nanometer resolution , has shown the tremendous promise of single - particle cryo - EM in this important structural biology ﬁeld ( Song et al . , 2014 ) . Future Perspectives for Single - Particle Cryo - EM Without a doubt , single - particle cryo - EM is no longer ‘‘blob - ology’’ but is now a method that can provide resolutions compa - rable with X - ray crystallography . However , unlike X - ray crystal - lography , which often ends up with a binary result of either having or not having a diffracting crystal , single - particle cryo - EM always yields some information ( although not always at atomic resolution ) . Even a reconstruction at a modest resolution provides information of how to improve the preparation as well as valuable biological insights . Thus , single - particle cryo - EM is probably even more attractive than X - ray crystallography in studying macromolecules . However , the technology of single - particle cryo - EM is still far from perfect and technological developments are still moving forward rapidly . The current resolution is still unsatisfactory in many ways . For example , extending the achievable resolution to beyond 3 A˚ is necessary to convincingly visualize the location of ions , or to visualize not only where but also how small ligand molecules bind to target proteins . The latter is of particular inter - est for the pharmaceutical industry because it can facilitate structure - based drug design and optimization . A recent review discusses in detail the current technical limitations of single - par - ticle cryo - EM , particularly in achieving higher resolution , and possible solutions ( Agard et al . , 2014 ) . Related to insufﬁcient res - olution , time spent on de novo model building and reﬁnement is often far more than that used to determine the reconstruction it - self . While many tools from X - ray crystallography can be applied to cryo - EM density map - based model building and reﬁnement , it requires signiﬁcant modiﬁcations ( Amunts et al . , 2014 ; Brown et al . , 2015 ) . Also , the traditional validation criterion in X - ray crystallography , such as the free R - factor , is no longer valid for models built into cryo - EM density maps . Therefore , tools and methodologies for efﬁcient model building , reﬁnement , and vali - dation all need further developments . In addition to improving the technology itself , there are other factors that limit the wide application of single - particle cryo - EM . First , the method itself is not yet a ‘‘turnkey’’ method . Even with automated data acquisition technology and stream - lined data processing , image acquisition , and processing is still too complex for a novice to learn with minimal training or by studying manuals . Second , the needed infrastructure , including fully functional cryo - EM equipment and computational re - sources for data processing and storage , requires signiﬁcant ﬁnancial investment . In addition to the initial investment , the ongoing costs required to maintain and operate a high - end cryo - EM facility are signiﬁcant . Third , there are currently too few synchrotron - like cryo - EM facilities dedicated for high - throughput cryo - EM data acquisition for the community at large . These limitations set the threshold for entering the ﬁeld far too high , and improving access will require efforts from multiple parties . Therefore , making the technology robust and relatively easy to learn , reducing the equipment and operational costs , and providing access to ready - to - use facilities staffed with experts will all be important steps toward making cryo - EM as widely used as X - ray crystallography . While the future of single - particle cryo - EM is bright , it requires strong support from the scientiﬁc community as well as from funding agencies to make the single particle cryo - EM as popular as X - ray crystallography .
