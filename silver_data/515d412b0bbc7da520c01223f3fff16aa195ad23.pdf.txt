The three layers of the glomerular ﬁltration barrier include the vascular endothelium , glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) , and podocyte epithelium . Podocytes are capable of internalizing albumin and are hypothesized to clear proteins that traverse the GBM . The present study followed the fate of FITC - labeled albumin to establish the mechanisms of albumin endocytosis and processing by podocytes . Confocal imaging and total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy of immortalized human podocytes showed FITC - albumin endocytosis occurred pref - erentially across the basal membrane . Inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis and caveolae - mediated endocytosis demonstrated that the majority of FITC - albumin entered podocytes through caveolae . Once internalized , FITC - albumin colocalized with EEA1 and LAMP1 , endocytic markers , and with the neonatal Fc receptor , a marker for transcytosis . After preloading podocytes with FITC - albumin , the majority of loaded FITC - albumin was lost over the subsequent 60 min of incubation . A portion of the loss of albumin occurred via lysosomal degradation as pretreatment with leupeptin , a lysosomal protease inhibitor , partially inhibited the loss of FITC - albumin . Consistent with transcytosis of albumin , preloaded podocytes also progressively re - leased FITC - albumin into the extracellular media . These studies conﬁrm the ability of podocytes to endocytose albumin and provide mechanistic insight into cellular mechanisms and fates of albumin handling in podocytes . albumin ; caveoli ; endocytosis ; podocytes ; trafﬁcking THE SPECIALIZED CAPILLARY BED of the renal glomerulus plays an essential role in the formation of urine . Under physiological conditions , the glomerulus readily allows the movement of water , ions , and small solutes from the plasma into the urinary space of the nephron . At the same time , the glomerulus restricts the exodus of cells and larger macromolecules . The glomerular ﬁltration barrier ( GFB ) is established by three adjacent physi - ological layers : vascular endothelial cells , glomerular base - ment membrane ( GBM ) proteins , and podocyte epithelial cells ( 21 ) . The ﬁrst ﬁltration layer , the glomerular endothelial cells are fenestrated , allowing the movement of most of the plasma constituents while still restricting the cellular components of blood to the vascular space . The second ﬁltration layer , the GBM is a meshwork of extracellular matrix proteins , including laminin , collagen IV , nidogen , and heparan sulfate proteogly - can ( 23 ) . The third ﬁltration layer , podocytes are a specialized epithelial cell type that completely encase the capillary tufts within the glomeruli . This coverage includes extensions of cellular processes out from the cell body . Progressive branch - ing ultimately generates ﬁne foot processes that interdigitate with the ﬁne foot processes of neighboring podocytes . By doing so , podocytes markedly increase the area available for the paracellular ﬂux of the glomerular ﬁltrate . To selectively restrict the paracellular ﬂux of speciﬁc solutes , the extracellular domains of speciﬁc integral membrane proteins extend be - tween these foot processes to form the slit diaphragm ( SD ) . Under physiological conditions , the SD forms a selective barrier that is highly permeable to water and small solutes but largely reﬂects macromolecules . Traditionally , only small amounts of albumin were thought to pass through the GFB and into the glomerular ultraﬁltrate ( 28 , 39 ) . Challenging this view , more recent studies have measured the passage of nephrotic levels of albumin through the GFB ( 32 , 34 ) . The ﬂux of albumin across the podocyte layer could arise by either the paracellular movement of albu - min through the SD or the transcellular migration of albumin through the podocytes . In support of albumin being transcyto - sed through podocytes , podocytes in culture endocytose albu - min ( 13 , 14 ) and , in human and animals models under albu - minuric conditions , albumin is observed within the cytoplasm of native podocytes ( 13 , 41 , 42 ) . In addition , a study by Kinugasa et al . ( 19 ) using Evans blue - labeled albumin demon - strated increased endocytosis of albumin by podocytes in vivo in a rat model of minimal change disease and albuminuria was decreased after treatment of proteinuric animals with an anti - body that blocks transcytosis . Several cell types are capable of endocytosing albumin but do so by distinct mechanisms . For example , renal proximal cells and alveolar type II cells endo - cytose albumin via clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 7 , 25 , 47 ) while cultured astrocytes , endothelial cells , and hepatocytes utilize caveolin - mediated endocytosis to bring albumin into the cell interior ( 4 , 6 , 9 ) . Once within the cells , the fate of albumin can vary . In most cell types , albumin is trafﬁcked to lysosomes where it is degraded ( 16 ) . In cells that express the neonatal Fc receptor ( FcRn ) , FcRn is capable of intercepting albumin from the degradation pathway and trafﬁcking albumin to the plasma membrane for transcytosis ( 20 ) . The present study utilized cultured human urine - derived podocyte - like epithelial cells ( HUPEC ) to examine albumin trafﬁcking pathways in podocytes . HUPEC cells express podo - cyte markers ( 33 ) and respond to albumin in a similar fashion as podocytes derived from human biopsy specimens ( 26 ) .

The ﬁndings advance the understanding of podocyte handling of albumin under physiological condi - tions and may contribute to the discovery of pathogenic mech - anisms that underlie chronic kidney diseases that are associated with albuminuria . MATERIALS AND METHODS Immunoﬂuorescence imaging of rat renal podocytes . All proce - dures involving animals were performed using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado , Denver . Male Sprague - Dawley rats ( 200 – 250 g ) were obtained from Harlan Laboratories ( Madison , WI ) . Animals were used to immunoblot or immunolocalize speciﬁc proteins within renal tissues , as previously described ( 12 ) . For the immunolocalization studies , the kidneys were cleared of blood by cannulating the descend - ing aorta and retrograde perfusion of phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) and then ﬁxed by perfusion with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ; Hatﬁeld , PA ) in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) . The kidneys were then removed , immersed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 60 min , cut into 3 – 4 mm cubes , infused with 5 % ( 2 h ) , 10 % ( 2 h ) and 25 % ( overnight ) sucrose , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and cryosectioned ( 5 – 8 (cid:2) m ) . Kidney sections were blocked [ 10 % normal goat serum and 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in PBS ] and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody synaptopodin ( undiluted , clone G1D4 , 10R - S125A , Fitzgerald Laboratories ) , clathrin ( 1 : 100 ; 23 / clathrin heavy chain , Becton - Dickinson ; Franklin Lakes , NJ ) caveolin - 1 ( 1 : 100 , Abcam , ab2910 , Cambridge , MA ) , and podocin ( 1 : 100 ; PO372 , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . After washing , the sections were incubated ( 30 min , room temperature ) with appropriate mix of Alexa 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , Alexa 633 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 500 ; Invitrogen ) , and Alexa 546 - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 : 100 ; Invitrogen ) . Sections were then washed with PBS and mounted in Mowiol 4 – 88 ( Calbiochem , Gibbstown , NJ ) containing 2 . 5 % 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ( Sigma ) . Fluorescence images were obtained using Zeiss Axiovert 200M laser - scanning confocal / multiphoton - excitation ﬂuorescence microscope with a Meta spectral detection system ( Zeiss NLO 510 with META , Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) . The imaging settings were initially deﬁned empirically to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio and to avoid saturation . In compar - ative imaging , the settings were kept constant between samples . Series of confocal ﬂuorescence images were simultaneously obtained with a Zeiss C - Apochromat 40x / 1 . 2NA water - immersion lens objective . The illumi - nation for imaging is provided by a 30 - mW argon laser , HeNe 5 mW ( 633 nm ) and 1 mW ( 543 nm ) . Image processing was performed using Zeiss ZEN 2008 software . Figures were mounted using Adobe Photoshop CS4 ( Adobe System ) . Cell culture . Human urine derived podocyte - like epithelial cells ( HUPEC ) carrying genes encoding a temperature - sensitive variant of the simian virus ( SV40 ) large tumor antigen and human telomerase were cultured and maintained , as previously described ( 33 ) . Brieﬂy , podocytes were grown on type I collagen - coated ﬂasks ( Fisher Sci - entiﬁc , Rochester , NY ) at 33°C ( growth permissive conditions ) in growth media [ RPMI 1640 medium ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone , Logan , UT ) , 15 mM HEPES , 5 mM L - glutamine , 100 U / ml penicillin , 100 U / ml streptomycin ; 5 % CO 2 atmosphere ] . After reaching conﬂuency , cells were seeded onto 35 mm type I collagen - coated dishes and maintained at 37°C ( growth restrictive conditions ) for 7 – 12 days to allow for differentiation . All cells were used between passages 17 and 25 . FITC - albumin uptake / degradation / transcytosis . FITC - labeled al - bumin was used to monitor and measure the uptake , degradation , and transcytosis of albumin by cultured podocytes . The fate of FITC - albumin was followed both biochemically and by immunoﬂuores - cence . Two hours prior to the experimental procedures , the media was changed to Ringer solution ( 122 . 5 mM NaCl , 5 . 4 mM KCl , 1 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 8 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 0 . 2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 5 . 5 mM glucose , and 10 mM HEPES ; pH 7 . 4 ) . For albumin uptake experiments , podocytes were incubated with 1 . 5 mg / ml human FITC - albumin ( MP Biomedicals , Santa Ana , CA ) in Ringer solution at either 4°C or 37°C for 0 , 60 , and 120 min . For the 4°C condition , cells were kept at 4°C while loading and then for the duration of the experiment . After the speciﬁed times , cells were washed 6 times with ice - cold PBS . For spectroﬂuorometric measure - ments , podocytes were lysed in 20 mM MOPS with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . FITC - ﬂuorescence was measured using an excitation wave - length of 490 nm and an emission wavelength of 540 nm . The amount of protein in the lysates was measured using the bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and the amount of cell associated FITC - albumin at each time point was normalized to the protein content . For Western blot analyses , podocytes were lysed in 50 (cid:2) l of 5x PAGE [ 50 mM Tris - base , 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 25 % sucrose , 5 mM EDTA ; pH 8 . 0 ; complete protease inhibitors ( Roche ; Indianapolis , IN ) ] . For degradation / transcytosis experiments , podocytes were incu - bated with 1 . 5 mg / ml human FITC - albumin solution for 90 min at 4°C or 37°C . Further , each group was run either with or without 20 (cid:2) M leupeptin , an inhibitor of lysosomal protein degradation . Leupeptin was added 15 min prior to loading and was present throughout the experiment . After FITC - albumin loading , podocytes were washed 6 times with ice - cold PBS , and Ringer solution was added for 0 , 30 min and 60 min . After the speciﬁed times , the Ringer solution from each dish was collected , completely lyophilized , and reconstituted in 50 (cid:2) l of 2 . 5x PAGE . The abundance of FITC - albumin released into the media and remaining in the podocytes was measured by Western blotting . Western blotting . For podocytes lysed in a 5x PAGE buffer , protein concentrations were measured by BCA assay ( Pierce ; Rockford , IL ) , and samples were reduced ( 10 % (cid:3) - mercaptoethanol ) . Cell lysates were run on 9 % polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellu - lose membranes ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Subsequent blocking , an - tibody , and wash solutions were diluted in blot buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 5 mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 ; pH 7 . 4 ) . Mem - branes were initially blocked ( 5 % nonfat dry milk ; 60 min ) and then incubated with primary antibody . Primary antibodies include FITC ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; clone ZF2471 – 1900 , Invitrogen ; Carlsbad , CA ) , synaptopo - din ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; H - 140 , Santa Cruz Biotech ; Santa Cruz , CA ) , GAPDH ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; FL - 335 , Santa Cruz Biotech ) , actin ( 1 : 5 , 000 ; JLA20 , Chemicon ; Temecula , CA ) , FcRn ( 1 : 100 ; H - 247 , Santa Cruz Bio - tech ) , EEA1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; 14 / EEA1 , Becton - Dickinson ; Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , LAMP1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; clone LY1C6 , Enzo , Farmingdale , NY ) , caveolin - 1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; ab2910 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) , and clathrin ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; 23 / clathrin heavy chain , Becton - Dickinson ) . Blots were then washed , incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 10 , 000 dilution ; Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) , and washed . The antibody complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Pierce ; Rockford , IL ) and captured using a photodocumentation system ( UVP ; Upland , CA ) . Immunoﬂuorescence . For confocal microscopic imaging of live cells , podocytes were seeded onto glass - bottom collagen - coated Mat - Tek dishes ( MatTek , Ashland , MA ) . Images were acquired on Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope ( Zeiss NLO 510 with META ; Zeiss Plan - Apochromat 63 / 1 . 4NA oil ; Thornwood , NY ) that was equipped with a temperature - controlled incubation chamber ( Solent Scientiﬁc ) as described above . For ﬁxed - cell images , podocytes were incubated in 4 % paraformal - dehyde in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( 20 min ; room temperature ) , washed , blocked with 10 % normal serum , and labeled with primary antibodies .

Cells were subsequently washed and labeled with the appropriate conjugated secondary antibodies ( Alexa Fluor 488 , Alexa Fluor 546 , Alexa Fluor 633 ; Invitrogen ) . F - actin was concurrently stained with Alexa - Phalloidin 633 or Alexa - Phalloidin 546 ( Invitrogen ) . The degree of colocalization of FITC - albumin with different mark - ers within the cells was quantiﬁed by calculating their intensity correlation quotient ( ICQ ) values ( 10 , 22 ) . Intensity _ Correlatio - n _ Analysis macros ( www . macbiophotonics . ca ) for this analysis were applied to ImageJ ( National Institute of Mental Health , Bethesda , MD ) . Values for the product of the differences from the mean ( PDM ) quantify the degree of pixel - by - pixel synchrony of the ﬂuorophore intensities in the two channels [ PDM (cid:4) ( R i - R ave ) (cid:5) ( G i - G ave ) ; R i (cid:4) individual pixel intensity - red , R ave (cid:4) average pixel intensity - red , G i (cid:4) individual pixel intensity - green , G ave (cid:4) average pixel intensity - green ] . The intensity correlation quotient ( ICQ ) ratio is equal to the ratio of the number of positive PDM values to the total number of pixel values [ ICQ (cid:4) ( N (cid:6) ve / N total ) ; N (cid:6) ve (cid:4) number of pixels with a positive PDM value , N total (cid:4) total number of pixels with a non - zero value in each channel ] . The 11 focal planes of 10 individual podocytes for each marker after 0 and 1 h of FITC - albumin uptake were analyzed ( ImageJ ; NIH ) . Total internal reﬂectance ﬂuorescence microscopy . Total internal reﬂectance ( TIRF ) microscopy was used for live - cell imaging of FITC - albumin internalization along the basal membrane of podocytes . Cells were initially incubated with FITC - albumin for 5 min at 37°C . Unbound extracellular FITC - albumin was then removed by washing with ice - cold PBS . Labeled cells were then placed in RPMI media without phenol red and imaged on a Zeiss TIRF microscope equipped with a temperature and CO 2 incubation chamber . Cells were kept at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 throughout the experiment . Images were acquired with a 100 (cid:5) 1 . 45 NA objective under the control of AxioVision V4 . 5 software ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NJ ) . Laser excitation of FITC - albumin was derived from a multiline argon ion laser . Excitation and emission wavelengths were selected using ﬁlter set for FITC ( 488 nm ) . Images were acquired every second for a total of 5 min . Inhibition of clathrin - and caveolin - mediated endocytosis . The relative contribution of clathrin - mediated and caveolin - mediated en - docytosis was evaluated using biochemical inhibitors . Clathrin - medi - ated endocytosis was inhibited by treating cells with 30 (cid:2) M Pitstop2 ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ; Ref . 44 ) . Caveolin - mediated endocytosis was inhibited by treating cells with 20 (cid:2) g / ml nystatin ( Calbiochem , Gibbstown , NJ ; Ref . 29 ) . For both inhibitors , podocytes were pre - treated for 15 min with inhibitor , and then 1 . 5 mg / ml of human FITC - albumin in Ringer was added as described above . The presence of inhibitors was maintained throughout the experiment . Statistical analysis . All data are presented as means (cid:7) SE . Statis - tical analysis was performed using t - tests for pairs of data and one - way analysis of variance for data groups of three or more using Prism - 4 GraphPad software . Tukey’s post hoc test was applied to the ANOVA data . Values were considered statistically signiﬁcant when P (cid:8) 0 . 05 . RESULTS HUPEC cells express podocyte - speciﬁc marker proteins .

To conﬁrm that the HUPEC cells used in this study express podocyte - speciﬁc proteins , these cells were evaluated by Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence imaging for synaptopodin expression . Western blot analysis shows the presence of synaptopodin in rat renal cortex ( Fig . 1 A ) while immunoﬂuorescence staining of rat renal cortex shows that synaptopodin antibody interacts with proteins within the glomerular tufts ( Fig . 1 B ) . Other renal cell types within the same section , such as proximal tubule cells , do not show any speciﬁc expression of synaptopodin . Western blot analysis of HUPEC lysates shows the presence of a speciﬁc synaptopodin band with a similar migration pattern as rat renal synaptopodin ( Fig . 1 A ) . Further , HUPEC cells , hereafter referred to as podocytes , were readily immunolabeled by synaptopodin antibodies . At low magniﬁcation using epi - ﬂuorescence , synaptopodin was observed broadly distributed throughout the cultured podocytes ( Fig . 1 C ) . At higher mag - niﬁcation with confocal imaging , costaining podocytes with synaptopodin and F - actin staining found that , similar to previ - ous podocyte studies ( 24 ) , much of the synaptopodin on the outer periphery of the cells colocalized with actin ﬁlaments . Time course of FITC - albumin uptake by cultured podocytes . The presence and time course of FITC - albumin uptake by podocytes were evaluated by comparing the amount of cell - associated FITC - albumin when cells were incubated at 37°C ( binding and internalization ) vs . at 4°C ( binding only ) . Podo - cytes were incubated with FITC - albumin for 0 , 30 , 60 , or 120 min . Spectroﬂuorometric analysis of cell lysates ( Fig . 2 A ; n (cid:4) 4 ) shows that FITC - albumin was taken up by podocytes in a temperature - sensitive manner . At 4°C , FITC - albumin signal at 0 min ( FITC - albumin added and washed off in (cid:8) 1 min ) was above background levels ( i . e . , cell surface binding ) but was unchanged after 120 min of additional incubation ( i . e . , minimal internalization ) . Podocytes incubated for 0 min at 37°C had a similar amount of FITC - albumin bound as the cells at 4°C . After 60 min of incubation at 37°C , however , the FITC - albumin signal was trending upward and was signiﬁcantly increased after 120 min of incubation . Similar studies using Western blot analysis had a similar pattern of FITC - albumin uptake ( Fig . 2 B ; n (cid:4) 5 ) . Podocytes without exposure to FITC - albumin ( 0 min ) showed no signal at either 4°C or 37°C . The FITC - albumin signal in cells incubated at 4°C was similar at the 60 min and 120 min time points while the signal in cells incubated at 37°C showed a progressive increase in these levels over both time points . Polarity of albumin uptake : basal membrane endocytosis . Fluorescence imaging of podocytes indicated there was a marked polarity in the uptake of FITC - albumin . Despite a predicted hindrance in accessing the basal membranes , FITC - albumin was preferentially endocytosed along the basal mem - brane . As shown in ﬁxed - cell confocal images after incubating podocytes with FITC - albumin for 10 min ( Fig . 3 A ) , FITC - albumin was abundant and readily observed in optical sections within 2 (cid:2) m of the basal membrane . In contrast , in optical sections over 8 (cid:2) m above the basal membrane , comparatively little FITC - albumin was observed . Live - cell TIRF microscopy was able to observe the dynamics of FITC - albumin - laden endosomes as they emerged and trafﬁcked within 100 nm of the basal membranes . Within minutes of adding FITC - albumin to the media , concentrated puncta consistent with FITC - albu - min - laden endosomes ( Fig . 3 B ; arrows ) emerged from the basal membrane . FITC - albumin undergoes caveolin - mediated uptake in podocytes . The pathway for albumin endocytosis is cell type dependent and includes either clathrin - or caveolin - mediated endocytosis ( 4 , 6 , 11 , 38 , 46 ) . Conﬁrming previous observations , confocal immunoﬂuorescence imaging of glomeruli in rat kidneys showed both clathrin and caveolin - 1 are expressed in glomer - ular tufts ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Western blotting of podocyte lysates similarly shows both clathrin and caveolin - 1 are ex - pressed in these cultured podocytes ( Fig . 5 A ) . Immunoﬂuores - cence imaging of the cultured podocytes found a small per - centage of FITC - albumin endosomes colocalized with caveo - lin - 1 ( Fig . 5 B ) . Little or no colocalization of FITC - albumin was observed with clathrin ( Fig . 5 C ) . This low percentage of colocalization could be due either to FITC - albumin not being associated with that pathway or to the transient nature of clathrin or caveolin - 1 association with albumin - containing en - dosomes following endosome formation . Consequently , a bio - chemical approach was applied to investigate the relative contributions of clathrin - and caveolin - mediated endocytosis in the internalization of FITC - albumin by podocytes .

Cultured podocytes endocytose FITC - albumin .

In podocytes at 37°C , the cell - associated FITC - albumin was trending upward after 60 min of incubation ( 78 . 8 (cid:7) 6 . 4 (cid:2) g FITC - albumin / mg protein ) and signiﬁcantly increased after 120 min of incubation ( 117 . 9 (cid:7) 19 . 3 (cid:2) g FITC - albumin / mg protein ) . n (cid:4) 5 . * P (cid:8) 0 . 05 compared with t (cid:4) 0 . B : similarly , Western blot analysis of FITC - albumin binding / uptake by podocytes at 37°C shows a marked increase in FITC - albumin ove r 2 h ofincubation . Podocytes at 4°C again showed initial binding but no change in albumin uptake between the 60 and 120 min time points . The faint laddering under the albumin band at 120 min at 37°C is likely due to albumin degradation within the cell .

Podocytes treated with Pitstop2 contin - ued to endocytose FITC - albumin and display the clear pres - ence of FITC - albumin - laden endosomes . Importantly , podo - cytes treated with nystatin showed a marked decrease in the amount of FITC - albumin endocytosis and generally had FITC - albumin labeling similar to control podocytes at 4°C . To quantify the effects of Pitstop2 and nystatin , FITC - albumin uptake levels by podocytes were evaluated by Western blot analysis ( Fig . 6 , B and C ) . Densitometric analysis showed that incubation at 37°C resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the accumulation of FITC - albumin when compared with podo - cytes incubated at 4°C . Inhibition of clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis with Pitstop2 had variable results with the mean value not being signiﬁcantly different from mean values of either the 4°C or 37°C control podocytes . Inhibition of caveolae - medi - ated endocytosis with nystatin , however , had a clear effect with the mean value being signiﬁcantly different from mean values of 37°C control podocytes . These ﬁndings indicate that while clathrin - mediated endocytosis may contribute , caveolae - medi - ated endocytosis plays the primary role in the internalization of albumin by podocytes . FITC - albumin trafﬁcs to early endosomes and lysosomes . Having established that FITC - albumin preferentially enters podocytes at the basal membrane via caveolae - mediated endo - cytosis , the intracellular fate of FITC - albumin was investi - gated . Speciﬁcally , it was determined whether FITC - albumin trafﬁcked through the early endosome to the lysosomal com - partment and whether FITC - albumin associated with the neo - natal Fc receptor ( FcRn ) . In numerous cell types , albumin is generally trafﬁcked to the lysosome and degraded . In speciﬁc cell types , FcRn intercepts and redirects albumin for transcy - tosis and release ( 2 , 5 , 8 , 18 ) . Western blotting shows human podocytes express EEA1 ( an early endosome marker ) , LAMP1 ( a lysosomal marker ) , and FcRn ( Fig . 7 A ) . To determine the intracellular trafﬁcking patterns of albumin in podocytes , podocytes were loaded with FITC - albumin for 10 min , ﬁxed , and imaged . Confocal imaging showed that a portion of the FITC - albumin - containing endosomes colocalized with EEA1 ( i . e . , early endosomes ; Fig . 7 B ) , LAMP1 ( i . e . , lysosomes ; Fig . 7 C ) , and FcRn ( i . e . , transcytotic endosome ; Fig . 7 D ) . ICQ analysis of FITC - albumin vs . the three marker proteins was evaluated after 10 min of loading at 1 - (cid:2) m steps along the vertical axis of each podocyte ( Fig . 7 , E – G ) . The modest ICQ values for FITC - albumin vs . each of the three endosomal markers is consistent with only a fraction of the total FITC - albumin being associated with each distinct compartment at any one time . Consistent with the preferential entry of FITC - albumin along the basal membrane , the highest degree of intensity correlation ( i . e . , colocalization ) for each endosomal marker protein was in the basal sections and diminished in the apical reaches of the podocytes . For both EEA1 and FcRn , the ﬂuorescence intensity correlations with FITC - albumin were consistent through the ﬁrst 9 (cid:2) m above the basal membrane before falling off . For LAMP1 , the ﬂuo - rescence intensity correlations with FITC - albumin fell off in regions 6 (cid:2) m above the basal membrane . This may reﬂect a delay in FITC - albumin progressing through the earlier en - dosomal compartments and trafﬁcking into the lysosomal compartments within the higher reaches of the podocytes . Degradation and transcytosis of FITC - albumin by podocytes . Having observed FITC - albumin colocalizing with putative degradation and transcytotic markers , the fate of the internal - ized FITC - albumin was investigated . Podocytes were initially incubated and loaded with FITC - albumin at 37°C or 4°C for 90 min . Extracellular FITC - albumin was then washed away and the cells incubated in unlabeled media . Cell lysates and media were collected at 0 min , 30 min , and 60 min and analyzed by Western blotting . Consistent with surface binding and no internalization , podocytes maintained at 4°C showed a modest amount of associated FITC - albumin following the loading period ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . This level remained unchanged over the experimental period . Podocytes loaded at 37°C had signif - 25kDa - 180kDa - Clathrin Caveolin - 1 A FITC - Albumin F - Actin Clathrin B FITC - Albumin F - Actin Caveolin - 1 C Fig . 5 .

After both 30 and 60 min of postloading incubation , these podocytes showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the amount of FITC - albumin associated with the podocytes . The decrease in FITC - albumin observed following washout could occur either from cellular degradation of FITC - albumin or from transcytosis ( i . e . , release ) of FITC - albumin . To eval - uate the contribution of lysosomal degradation , a paired set of podocytes was incubated in the presence of 20 (cid:2) M leupeptin . Signiﬁcantly more albumin was found in the cellular fraction of podocytes loaded at 37°C in the presence of leupeptin compared with those loaded at 37°C without leupeptin ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) , suggesting that a portion of albumin endocytosed by podocytes is degraded in the lysosome . Sixty minutes after loading , there was a trend toward increased albumin accumu - lation ( which was not statistically signiﬁcant ) in podocytes treated with leupeptin compared with podocytes incubated at 37°C without leupeptin . These data are consistent with either partial inhibition of degradation by leupeptin or removal of albumin from the cell via an additional pathway such as transcytosis . In support of the presence of transcytosis , there was a signiﬁcant accumulation of full - length FITC - albumin in the media after 30 and 60 min of incubation ( Fig . 8 , A and C ) . This indicates that after having taken up FITC - albumin , a portion of the FITC - albumin trafﬁcs to the plasma membrane and is released from the podocytes . The levels of FITC - albumin released by podocytes into the medium were not impacted by leupeptin treatment . DISCUSSION The long - standing model of the GFB had only a very small percentage of plasma proteins such as albumin traversing the GFB and entering the urinary space .

FITC - albumin endocytosis by cultured podocytes is caveolae - dependent . A : when incubated with FITC - albumin ( green ) for 60 min at 4°C , little or no FITC - albumin is observed within the interior of control podocytes . Incubation for 60 min at 37°C results in a marked level of FITC - albumin associated with the control podocytes . FITC - albumin also associated with podocytes when incubated at 37°C in the presence of Pitstop2 , an inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . In contrast , podocytes coincubated with nystatin , which inhibits caveolin - dependent endocytosis , had little or no observed endocytosis of FITC - albumin . Bar (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) m . F - actin staining is shown in red . B : Western blot analysis shows the comparative FITC - albumin levels in podocytes incubated with FITC - albumin for 60 min . The coincubation of Pitstop2 had no observed effect while nystatin treatment markedly inhibited FITC - albumin uptake . GAPDH served as a loading control . C : densitometric analysis of the Western blots shows control podocytes at 37°C had 53 (cid:7) 4 % more FITC - albumin than control cells at 4°C . The FITC - albumin uptake in cells coincubated with Pitstop2 ( 137 (cid:7) 19 % of control cells at 4°C ) was not signiﬁcantly different from either the 4°C or the 37°C control cells . The coincubation with nystatin resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in FITC - albumin uptake ( 82 (cid:7) 9 % of control cells at 4°C ) compared with control cells at 37°C . n (cid:4) 6 .

Albumin has also been found within the podocyte cell body in human and rodent proteinuric kidney disease ( 19 , 41 , 43 ) . In vivo two - photon imaging of rat renal glomeruli determined the glomerular sieving coefﬁcient for albumin ( GSC A ) varies from (cid:10) 0 . 016 to (cid:10) 0 . 034 ( 32 , 34 ) which is much higher than that obtained by traditional micropuncture techniques , which gave a GSC of 0 . 00062 in rats ( 40 ) . Depending on the value used to calculate the GSC ( 0 . 00062 to 0 . 034 ) , the amount of albumin ﬁltered through the glomerulus could range fro m 3 g to 200 g per day . While several theories have been proposed to explain why the GFB does not clog with serum proteins such as albumin and IgG ( 36 ) , podocyte uptake and disposal of serum proteins provides a biologically plausible mechanism for maintaining GFB homeostasis . Evidence for the importance of the podocyte in preventing GFB clogging comes from the following : In animals with heavy proteinuria , albumin - ﬁlled vesicles are found within the podocyte cell body ( 19 , 43 ) ; IgG appears to collect in the GFB in mice that lack FcRn ( 1 ) and podocytes endocytose albumin in vitro ( 14 , 26 ) . The mechanism by which albumin traverses the podocyte epithelial layer remains to be deﬁned . Although the slit dia - phragms between interdigitated podocytes were generally con - sidered to resist the vast majority of the paracellular passage of albumin , scanning electron microscopy indicates that the SD may have pores large enough to allow the diffusion of proteins with the diameter of albumin ( 15 , 31 ) . Alternatively , albumin may cross the epithelium via transcellular transport . Several cell types , including proximal tubule cells ( 48 ) , endothelial cells ( 38 ) , and astrocytes ( 4 ) , are capable of endocytosing albumin by either clathrin - mediated or caveolae - mediated en - docytosis . While most cells can trafﬁc albumin to the lyso - somal compartment for degradation , proximal tubule cells divert much of the albumin away from lysosomes , trafﬁc albumin to the basal membrane , and release albumin into the serosa . Podocytes are also capable of endocytosing albumin ( 14 , 26 ) . The present study utilized immortalized podocytes that were isolated from the urine of a normal subject to explore and deﬁne the polarity , endocytic pathways , and fate of the albumin in human podocytes . Podocytic uptake of albumin occurred along the basal membrane . The polarity of albumin uptake has signiﬁcant implications for our understanding the purpose of the uptake . Preferential uptake at the apical membrane , which faces the urinary space , would suggest that the function of albumin A 46kDa - 170kDa - 120kDa - FcRn EEA1 LAMP1 D FITC - Albumin FcRn F - Actin B FITC - Albumin EEA1 F - Actin FITC - Albumin LAMP1 F - Actin C - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 EEA1 vs Albumin I C Q va l u es E - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 LAMP1 vs Albumin I C Q va l u es F - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 FcRn vs Albumin I C Q va l u es G Fig . 7 .

The modest ICQ values for FITC - albumin vs . each of the three endosomal markers is consistent with only a fraction of the total FITC - albumin being associated with each distinct compartment at any one time . Consistent with the preferential entry of FITC - albumin along the basal membrane , the highest degree of intensity correlation for each marker protein was in the basal sections and diminished in the apical reaches of the podocytes .

Preferential uptake at the basal membrane , which abuts the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) , would support the hypothesis that podocytes internalize albu - min and other large proteins from the GBM - podocyte interface to reduce the accumulation of proteins along the slit dia - phragms and maintain the ﬁltration characteristics of the GFB ( 1 ) . In the present albumin uptake studies , podocytes were adhered onto collagen - coated coverslips . During the FITC - albumin incubation period , the FITC - albumin was considered to have unfettered access to the apical membrane while diffu - sional access to the basal membrane was predicted to be hindered . Despite this potential limitation , both ﬁxed - cell con - focal microscopy and live - cell TIRF microscopy studies dem - onstrated preferential uptake of FITC - albumin at the basal membrane ( Fig . 3 ) . If representative of native podocytes , this ﬁnding is consistent with the hypothesis that podocytes take up albumin , the most abundant protein in serum , in an effort to maintain a clear ﬁltration barrier . If one function of podocyte albumin uptake is to prevent protein clogging of the slit diaphragm , albumin endocytosis is predicted to be particularly enhanced at the extremity of the foot processes ( i . e . , at the foot process sole and the adjacent lateral aspects ) as these regions lie in the space between the GBM and the slit diaphragm . One limitation of the present studies is that cultured podocytes do not manifest well - developed foot processes that would allow this localization to be studied in vitro . Podocytic uptake of albumin occurred by caveolae - mediated endocytosis . While a number of distinct cell types endocytose albumin , the pathway for cell entry varies between cell types . More speciﬁcally , renal proximal tubules and alveolar epithe - lial cells use clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 7 , 46 , 48 ) while astrocytes , cultured hepatocytes and endothelial cells utilize caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( 4 , 6 , 38 ) . The present study found marker proteins for both clathrin - coated pits and cave - olae were expressed in podocytes ( Fig . 5 ) . While both clathrin and caveolin are expressed in podocytes , the present study found that inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis had little or no effect on the level of albumin endocytosis whereas inhibition of caveolae - mediated endocytosis profoundly blunted albumin endocytosis in these cells ( Fig . 6 ) . In other cell types , caveolae - dependent endocytosis is dy - namically regulated . Endothelial cell response to oxidative stress includes phosphorylation of caveolin - 1 and increased albumin uptake ( 38 ) . Caveolin - 1 is also thought to play a role in transducing stretch and shear stress information to signaling pathways . In vascular endothelial cells , caveolin - 1 is required for ﬂow - mediated dilation of the vessel walls ( 45 ) . In podo - cytes , caveolin - 1 is found at the slit diaphragm where it A 37 °C 37 °C + leupeptin 4 °C 0 30 60 FITC GAPDH FITC cells media 0 30 60 0 30 60 0 . 00 1 . 00 2 . 00 3 . 00 0 30 60 F I T C ( R e l a t i v e t o 0 m i n a t 37 ° C ) C Media 0 . 00 0 . 50 1 . 00 1 . 50 0 30 60 B F I T C / G A P D H ( R e l a t i v e t o 0 m i n a t 37 ° C ) Cells a 4 °C 37 °C 37 °C + leupeptin b c a a a a a a a a a a a b b b b Fig . 8 . Lysosomal degradation and transcytosis of FITC - albumin by cultured podocytes . To evaluate the capacities of podocytes to degrade and transcytose FITC - albumin , cells were preincubated ( i . e . , loaded ) with FITC - albumin for 60 min and then the cells and media were harvested at speciﬁc time points . A : Western blot analysis of FITC - albumin from podocytes kept at 4°C showed modest loading and minimal change over the subsequent 60 min of incubation . Podocytes at 37°C had robust loading and progressive loss of FITC - albumin after 30 min and 60 min of incubation . Podocytes treated with leupeptin also had robust cell loading but had a reduced rate of loss in the 60 min after loading . Analysis of FITC - albumin in the media shows that cells incubated at 37°C had a progressive release of FITC - albumin in either the absence or presence of leupeptin . B : densitometric analysis showed leupeptin treatment increased the amount of FITC - albumin loading and partially preserved FITC - albumin levels after 60 min of subsequent incubation .

In addition , the effects of angiotensin II on podocytes are mediated at least in part by caveolin . Ren et al . ( 30 ) have found that angiotensin II upregulates phospho - caveo - lin 1 both in vivo and in vitro and that silencing caveolin - 1 decreases angiotensin II - induced apoptosis in cultured podo - cytes . It will be of interest to determine if the extracellular albumin load inﬂuences glomerular dynamics and rates of albumin endocytosis . Podocytes both degrade and transcytose albumin . Studies in other cell type have found that both clathrin - mediated and caveolae - mediated endocytosis can deliver albumin to the lysosomal compartment ( 6 , 27 , 48 ) . Colocalization and ICQ analyses of FITC - albumin and LAMP1 in podocytes showed that a portion of the albumin trafﬁcked into the lysosomal compartments ( Fig . 7 ) , and inhibition of leupeptin - sensitive proteolysis found (cid:10) 20 % of the internalized albumin underwent lysosomal degradation ( Fig . 8 ) . In proximal tubule cells , FcRn can rescue albumin from the lysosomal degradation pathway and redirect the albumin for transcytotic release at the basal membrane ( 3 , 35 ) . FcRn also plays a pivotal role in the transcytosis of albumin in endothelial cells ( 3 ) . In a related model of FcRn - dependent protein clear - ance , FcRn ( (cid:11) / (cid:11) ) mice have a marked accumulation of IgG within the GBM ( 1 ) . Like albumin , IgG is a very abundant serum protein . As with other podocyte models ( 1 , 17 ) , HUPEC podocytes also express FcRn , and FcRn colocalizes with a subpopulation of albumin - laden endosomes ( Fig . 7 ) . While the present studies did not determine the dependence on FcRn , pulse - chase studies demonstrated that following endocytic loading of FITC - albumin into the cells , podocytes released a signiﬁcant portion of the FITC - albumin back into the extracel - lular media ( Fig . 8 ) . Our data support the ﬁndings of Kinugasa et al . ( 19 ) , who demonstrated that purine aminonucleoside - induced nephrotic syndrome in in vivo rats that albumin uptake by podocytes is increased . Further , administration of an anti - body against FcRn decreased proteinuria in the PAN - treated animals providing additional evidence for a role for FcRn in albumin trafﬁcking in podocytes ( 19 ) . Taken together , the polarized uptake of albumin from the basal membrane along with the capacity of the podocytes to release full length FITC - albumin back into the extracellular space supports the hypothesis that podocytes actively engage in clearing large serum proteins that make it to the GBM - podocyte interface . These studies contribute new insights into the physiology of podocytes and the molecular and cellular mechanisms that allow for the exquisite control of glomerular ﬁltration .
