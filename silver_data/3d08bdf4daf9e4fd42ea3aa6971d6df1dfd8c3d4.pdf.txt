Signal Transduction Fer Protein - Tyrosine Kinase Promotes Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Invasion and Tumor Metastasis Joseph Ahn 1 , 3 , Peter Truesdell 1 , 3 , Jalna Meens 1 , 3 , Carli Kadish 1 , Xiaolong Yang 2 , Alexander H . Boag 2 , and Andrew W . B . Craig 1 , 3 Abstract Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) is frequently ampli ﬁ ed or mutated in non – small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Although Fer protein - tyrosine kinase signals downstream of EGFR , its role in NSCLC tumor progression has not been reported . Here , Fer kinase was elevated in NSCLC tumors compared to normal lung epithelium . EGFR signaling in NSCLC cells fosters rapid Fer activation and increased localization to lamellipodia . Stable silencing of Fer in H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells ( Fer KD ) caused impaired EGFR - induced lamellipodia formation compared to control cells . Fer KD NSCLC cells showed reduced Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation that was correlated with direct Fer - mediated phosphorylation of Vav2 on tyrosine - 172 , which was previously reported to increase the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of Vav2 . Indeed , Fer KD cells displayed defects in Rac - GTP localization to lamellipodia , cell migration , and cell invasion in vitro . To test the role of Fer in NSCLC progression and metastasis , control and Fer KD cells were grown as subcutaneous tumors in mice . Although Fer was not required for tumor growth , Fer KD tumor - bearing mice had signi ﬁ cantly fewer numbers of spontaneous metastases . Combined , these data demonstrate that Fer kinase is elevated in NSCLC tumors and is important for cellular invasion and metastasis . Implications : Fer protein - tyrosine kinase is a potential therapeutic target in metastatic lung cancer . Mol Cancer Res ; 11 ( 8 ) ; 952 – 63 . (cid:1) 2013 AACR . Introduction Non – small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) is the most common form of lung cancer and the leading cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide . NSCLC has a 5 - year survival rate of only 15 % due in part to advanced disease at diagnosis and high rates of metastases . A subset of NSCLC ' s acquire increased copy number or gain - of - func - tion mutations in EGF receptor ( EGFR ) leading to consti - tutive EGFR signaling to pathways controlling cell growth , survival , and motility ( 1 ) . EGFR is a known driver of NSCLC as transgenic mice with inducible expression of mutant alleles of EGFR ( e . g . , D 747 - 752 or L858R ) in type II lung pneumocytes develop lung adenocarcinomas that regressed upon treatment with an EGFR inhibitor ( 2 ) . Indeed , patients with lung cancer with activating EGFR mutations who are treated with EGFR inhibitors frequently show a positive initial response but eventually relapse due to development of resistance ( 3 ) . Therefore , identifying new targets for molecular - targeted therapies and development of combinational therapies may lead to improved NSCLC patient outcomes . Fer ( Fes - related ) is a widely expressed nonreceptor tyro - sine kinase that is activated downstream of EGFR ( 4 ) , and was recently reported to promote resistance to quinacrine ( 5 ) , an antimalarial drug with potential as a cancer thera - peutic ( 6 ) . Fer is composed of 4 domains : F - BAR ( Fer / CIP4 homology - Bin / amphiphysin / RVS ) , FX ( extended F - BAR ) , SH2 ( Src homology 2 ) , and a protein - tyrosine kinase domain . F - BAR domains form crescent - shaped dimers that bind phosphoinositides that are enriched in membrane microdomains at sites of endocytosis and ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) polymerization ( 7 ) . The F - BAR domains ofFer and Fes , a more tissue - restricted family member ( 8 ) , were ini - tially shown to bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 9 , 10 ) . More recently , the FX domain in Fer was shown to bind phosphatidic acid ( PA ) , leading to enhanced Fer kinase activity and localization to lamellipodia ( 11 ) . Itoh and colleagues also show that Fer promotes cell motility in a phospholipase D ( PLD ) / PA – dependent pathway ( 11 ) . Recently , Fes was also shown to bind phosphatidic acid and participate in a PLD - induced pathway of myeloid differentiation ( 12 ) . The SH2 domain of Fer confers binding to tyrosine - phosphorylated proteins , including receptor tyrosine kinases [ e . g . , EGFR , platelet - derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , etc . ] , adaptor proteins ( e . g . , cortactin , Gab1 , etc . ) , and immune receptors ( 8 ) .

MCR - 13 - 0003 - T fragment of Fes was solved , and this revealed a critical interface allowing allosteric regulation between the SH2 and kinase domains ( 13 ) . The implications of this study are that Fes kinase activation occurs only upon ligand binding to its SH2 domain . Because of conservation of these critical interface residues between Fer and Fes , it is likely that Fer kinase activation also requires the SH2 domain to be bound to ligands such as EGFR . A number of studies have identi ﬁ ed Fer activation or upregulation in a number of different cancers , including lung ( 14 ) , hepatic ( 15 ) , prostate ( 16 ) , and triple - negative breast cancer ( 17 ) . Overexpression of Fer was also linked to quinacrine resistance and enhanced activation of NF - k B pathway ( 5 ) . Other Fer substrates are linked to tumor progression and metastasis . The transcription factor STAT3 is a known substrate of Fer , and has been linked to prostate tumor progression ( 16 ) . The actin regulatory protein cortactin is a substrate of Fer downstream of growth factor receptors and integrins ( 18 – 20 ) . Recent studies also implicate Fer in signaling via Rac GTPase to promote lamellipodia formation and cell motility ( 11 ) . Overexpression of Fer also correlated with enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 ( 11 ) , a Rac guanine exchange factor ( GEF ) that is activated via tyrosine phos - phorylation downstream of EGFR ( 21 ) . Fer may also promote Rac activation by phosphorylating RhoGDI a to limit Rac1 binding ( 22 ) , and prevent sequestration by RhoGDI a ( 23 ) . In this report , we show that Fer is expressed in normal lung tissue , primarily in type II pneumocytes , and at elevated levels in NSCLC ( adenocarcinoma and squamous subtypes ) . EGF treatment of H1299 lung adenocarcino - ma cells led to rapid Fer activation and localization to leading edge membrane projections . Fer silencing reduced lamellipodia formation , motility , and cell invasion via defects in the Vav2 / Rac signaling axis . Stable silencing of Fer also reduced spontaneous metastases in subcuta - neous tumor xenograft assays in mice . Together , these ﬁ ndings identify Fer as a positive regulator of EGFR - induced lamellipodia formation , cell motility , invasion , and tumor metastasis . Materials and Methods Cell culture , transfections , and EGF treatment NCI - H1299 were purchased from American Type Cul - ture Collection and were maintained in Dulbecco ' s modi ﬁ ed Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 1 % glutamine ( Invitrogen ) , and 1 % anti - mycotic / antibiotics ( Invitrogen ) at 37 (cid:1) C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . A549 cells were acquired from Dr . Susan Cole ( Queen ' s University , Kingston , ON , Canada ) and grown in 5 % FBS as earlier . Immortalized wild - type ( WT ; fer þ / þ ) and fer - de ﬁ cient ( fer DR / DR ) mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts ( MEF ) were described previously ( 19 , 20 ) . Transient transfections of cells with plasmid DNA were conducted using FuGENE HD ( Roche Diagnostics Inc . ) or X - tremeGENE ( Roche Applied Science ) according to the manufacturer ' s directions . EGF stimulation of H1299 cells were conducted by starving overnight in serum - free media ( 16 hours ) before treatment with human EGF ( 50 or 100 ng / mL ; Peprotech ) for indi - cated times in ﬁ gure legends . EGF stimulation of MEF cells was conducted by starving in serum - free media for 48 hours before treatment with human EGF ( 100 ng / mL for 5 minutes ) . Generation of stable Fer knockdown cell lines pGIPZ - based lentiviral transfection encoding a nontar - geting short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) and Fer - speci ﬁ c shRNA ( FerKD1 : 5 0 - CTATCCAAATTTGAATCTA - 3 0 , FerKD2 : 5 0 – AGGCTCACCATGATGATTA - 3 0 ) were obtained from Open Biosystems . Lentiviral plasmids were cotransfected with packaging and envelope plasmids ( CMV D R8 . 91 and MD . 2G ) in HEK 293T human embryonic kidney cells and viral supernatants collected at 48 hours . H1299 and A549 cells were transduced with the above viruses and stable cell pools were selected after 48 hours in media with puromycin ( 2 m g / mL ) . Cell pools were passaged several times and lysates prepared to test the ef ﬁ ciency of Fer silencing by immunoblotting . Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting For immunoprecipitation assays , cells were lysed in Mg2 þ lysis buffer [ 50 mmol / L Tris – HCL ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mmol / L NaCL , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 25 % sodium deoxycholate , 10 % glycerol , 25 nmol / L NaF , 10 mmol / L MgCl 2 , 1 mmol / L EDTA , 10 m g / mL aprotinin , 10 m g / mL leupeptin , 1 mmol / L Na 3 VO 4 , and 100 m mol / L phenyl - methylsulfonyl ﬂ uoride ] and soluble cell lysates ( SCL ) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti - Fer ( 24 ) antibodies or mouse anti - Vav2 antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; H - 200 ) , and recovered with 25 m L of GammaBind Sepharose ( 50 % v / v slurry in PBS ) , per 1 mL SCL . After extensive washing , the immune complex was subjected to SDS - PAGE as described later . For immunoblot assays , cells were lysed using kinase lysis buffer [ 20 mmol / L Tris – HCL ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 nmol / L NaCl , 1 mmol / L EDTA , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 10 m g / mL aprotinin , 10 m g / mL leupeptin , 1 mmol / L Na 3 VO 4 , 100 m mol / L phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂ uoride ] . Cell lysates were separated by SDS - PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to Immobilon P membranes ( Millipore ) using a semi - dry transfer appara - tus ( Bio - Rad ) . Membranes were blocked in either 5 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for antiphosphotyrosine antibodies ( pY99 ) , or 5 % nonfat milk for all other anti - bodies and then probed with antibodies directed against : Fer ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; ref . 24 ) , p - Tyr ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Santa Cruz Bio - technology ; PY99 ) , tubulin ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Sigma ; T6074 ) , actin ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; C4 ) , Vav2 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; H - 200 ) , phospho - 172 Vav2 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; ECM Biosciences ) , Rac1 ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Millipore ; 23A8 ) , active Rac1 - GTP ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; NewEast Biosciences ) , and transferrin ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Invitrogen ; H68 . 4 ) overnight at 4 (cid:1) C . Antibody – antigen complexes were detected using either horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) – con - jugated goat anti - mouse immunoglobulin ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; GE Fer Promotes Lung Cancer Metastasis www . aacrjournals . org Mol Cancer Res ; 11 ( 8 ) August 2013 953 on April 14 , 2017 . © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research . mcr . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Published OnlineFirst May 22 , 2013 ; DOI : 10 . 1158 / 1541 - 7786 . MCR - 13 - 0003 - T Healthcare ) or HRP - conjugated goat anti - rabbit immu - noglobulin ( 1 : 10 , 000 ; GE Healthcare ) and followed by enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; Applied Biological Materials ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining and confocal microscopy Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining was conducted on serum - starved H1299 cells plated on ﬁ bronectin ( 20 ng / mL ) – coated coverslips , and treated with EGF ( 50 ng / mL ) for the times indicated in ﬁ gure legends . Cells were incubated with mouse anti - Fer antibodies ( 1 : 50 ; Selleck ; 5D2C4 ) or mouse anti - active Rac1 ( Rac GTP - speci ﬁ c ) antibody ( 1 : 50 ; NewEast Biosciences ) , detected with either Alexa Fluor 568 - or 633 – conjugated goat anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G ( IgG ; 1 : 200 ; Invitrogen ) or Alexa Fluor 568 - or 633 – conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 200 ; Invitrogen ) and counterstained with Tritc - phalloidin ( 1 : 400 ; Invitrogen ) and 4 0 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; 1 : 400 ; Invitro - gen ) and analyzed by confocal microscopy ( HCX PL APO DIC 63X / 132 Oil CS objective ; WaveFX - X1 spinning disc confocal microscope ; Quorum Technologies Inc . ) . Analysis of Fer expression in NSCLC cell lines and tumor homogenates Fer expression was analyzed in a panel of normal lung epithelial ( NL20 ) and NSCLC cell lines ( NCI - H1299 , A549 , NCI - H1975 , HCC - 827 , SK - LuCi - 6 , QU - DB , and LC - T ; described in ref . 25 ) . Tumor and adjacent normal lung tissues were acquired from the Ontario Tumor Bank ( Ontario Institute for Cancer Research , Toronto , ON , Canada ) . These biopsies were collected at initial diagnosis of 12 patients with NSCLC ( ages , 48 – 75 years ; grade 2 – 3 ) . Homogenates were prepared and along with cell lysates above , were subjected to immunoblot with Fer and actin antibodies . Cell growth assays Cell growth assays were conducted on H1299 control and Fer knockdown ( KD ) cells grown to 80 % con ﬂ uence . Cells were trypsinized , ﬁ xed in 70 % ethanol overnight at 4 (cid:1) C , and treated with 0 . 1 mg / mL RNaseA in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature . Cells were permeabilized with PBS with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 and resuspended in propidium iodide ( PI ; 10 m g / mL ) / RNase A ( 0 . 1 mg / mL ) at 37 (cid:1) C for 20 minutes . Samples were analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . Cell migration assays Wound - healing assays were conducted on con ﬂ uent monolayers of H1299 and A549 cells ( nontargeting and Fer knockdown ) that were serum - starved overnight before forming a wound using a pipette tip and removal - sus - pended cells . Cells were stimulated with media supple - mented with EGF ( 50 ng / mL ) and phase contrast micro - graphs acquired ( 0 hours ) . After 18 to 24 hours of incubation , cells were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet and images were taken at the same positions taken at 0 hours . Cell migration was quanti ﬁ ed as the difference between cell - free areas at time 0 and 18 hours for the same ﬁ eld of view . Agarose drop chemotaxis assays were conducted as previously described with minor alterations ( 26 ) . Coverslips were coated with ﬁ bronectin ( 20 ng / mL ) for 24 hours at room temperature before adding an agarose drop ( 0 . 1 % low - melting tem - perature agarose ) supplemented with EGF ( ﬁ nal concen - tration of 20 ng / m L ) . H1299 cells ( 20 , 000 ) were stained with either CellTracker orange or CellTracker green ( Invitrogen ; 10 m mol / L ) for 1 hour before plating on coverslips and allowed to adhere for 6 hours at 37 (cid:1) C . Postadherence images from the edge of the agarose drop were acquired by the Quorum Wave FX microscope ( (cid:3) 10 objective ) every 10 minutes for 18 hours in a chamber heated to 37 (cid:1) C in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . Migration analysis was conducted using the manual tracking suite in ImageJ ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Invasion assays Boyden chamber invasion assays were conducted using Transwell inserts ( 8 m m ; BD Biosciences ) coated with 17 m L of growth factor – reduced Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ) that were allowed to solidify at 37 (cid:1) C for 30 minutes . The inserts were placed in a 24 - well plate containing DMEM supple - mented with 10 % FBS and 50 , 000 H1299 cells in DMEM with 0 . 5 % FBS were plated into the upper chamber . For assays with A549 cells , TGF - b 1 ( 2 ng / mL ) was included to increase their invasive potential . After 48 hours for A549 and 60 hours for H1299 cells , the ﬁ lters were ﬁ xed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , Matrigel from the upper chamber was removed and ﬁ lters were stained with DAPI . Epi ﬂ uorescence was used to detect nuclei of cells that had invaded and image ﬁ elds were scored using Image Pro Plus software ( Media Cybernetics ) . Vav2 constructs and in vitro kinase assays Plasmids encoding Vav2 glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusions with different point mutations were obtained from Dr . Buday Laszlo ( Hungarian Academy of Sciences , Buda - pest , Hungary ; ref . 21 ) . All plasmids were transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli , grown to mid log phase in Luria Broth ( LB ) and induced with 1 mmol / L isopropyl - l - thio - B - [ scap ) d [ r ] - galactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Cell pellets were resus - pended in A1000 buffer [ 1 mol / L NaCl , 20 mmol / L Tris – HCL ( pH 8 ) , 0 . 2 mmol / L EDTA , 0 . 5 mmol / L dithio - threitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 , 10 m g / mL aprotinin , 10 m g / mL leupeptin , and 100 m mol / L phenylmethylsulfo - nyl ﬂ uoride ] , treated with lysozyme ( 166 ng / mL ) for 30 minutes , sonicated , and cleared by centrifugation . GST - fusion proteins were puri ﬁ ed on prepared glutathione – sepharose beads and subsequently eluted using glutathione elution buffer [ 50 mmol / L Tris – HCL ( pH 8 ) and 3 . 1 mg / mL reduced glutathione ] . Puri ﬁ ed GST - fusion proteins were treated with thrombin ( 10 U / mg ) to remove the GST tag . For kinase reactions , cleaved Vav2 constructs ( 1 m g ) were incubated with or without 250 ng of active Fer ( GST - fusion to SH2 - kinase ; Signal Chem ) in kinase reaction buffer [ 0 . 2 mol / L Tris – HCL ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 0 . 1 mmol / L Na 3 VO 4 , 10 Ahn et al .

Tumor xenograft assays Rag2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) : g c (cid:4) / (cid:4) mice ( BALB / c background ) are de ﬁ cient in NK / B / T cells and recently shown to be an excellent model for detecting lung metastases ( 27 ) . All experiments were approved by the Queen ' s University Animal Care Commit - tee . H1299 nontargeting and Fer knockdown cells were grown to 80 % to 90 % con ﬂ uence , trypsinized and counted . For xenografting assays , cells were injected subcutaneously into the ﬂ ank area of the mice ( ( 2 . 5 (cid:3) 10 6 cells in 100 m L ) . After 5 weeks , mice were sacri ﬁ ced and tumor masses were recorded . The tumor and lung tissues were resected , ﬁ xed in formalin , and embedded in paraf ﬁ n . Paraf ﬁ n blocks were serially sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination . Three sections , spaced 25 m m apart , from each mouse were digitally scanned and metastatic nodules were manually scored in a blinded fashion . Tumor tissue microrrays and immunohistochemistry Tissue microarrays covering a range of lung cancer types ( LC1005 ; US Biomax ) were stained using the VMSI Dis - covery XT Automated Immunostainer ( Ventana Medical Systems , Inc . ) . Antigens were retrieved with EDTA ( pH 8 ) solution and incubated with mouse anti - Fer ( Selleck ; 5D2C4 ; diluted 1 : 100 in TBS / 1 % BSA ) . As a control for speci ﬁ city , an aliquot of mouse anti - Fer that was precleared with beads containing GST - Fer - FX domain that overlaps the antigenic region ( amino acids 280 – 474 ) was also used . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) signals were developed using biotinylated goat anti - mouse secondary antibody followed by 3 , 3 0 - diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) and hematoxylin coun - terstained . Tissue microarrays were digitally scanned and were scored using ImageScope software ( Aperio ) to calculate H scores according to the formula H ¼ ( % negative (cid:3) 0 ) þ ( % weak positive (cid:3) 100 ) þ ( % positive (cid:3) 200 ) þ ( % strong positive (cid:3) 300 ) , as described in ref . ( 28 ) . Statistical and image analysis Statistical signi ﬁ cance ( (cid:5) , P (cid:6) 0 . 05 ) was determined using paired Students t test in Microsoft Excel . Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism . ImageJ image - analysis software with the manual tracking package was used for quanti ﬁ cation analysis of cell migration . Results Expression of Fer kinase in normal human lung tissue and NSCLC tumors To evaluate Fer expression in normal lung and NSCLC tumors , we surveyed Fer levels in NSCLC tumors and matched normal lung tissue homogenates by immunoblot . Although Fer was expressed in all samples , we observed increased Fer protein levels in most tumors ( T ) compared with their normal ( N ) lung tissue controls ( Fig . 1A ; 2 . 2 (cid:7) 0 . 4 ( mean (cid:7) SEM ) for T : N ratio ; actin served as a loading control ) . To visualize Fer expression in these tissues , we ﬁ rst established optimal immunohistochemical staining condi - tions ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Importantly , antisera deple - tion using a recombinant Fer construct ( FX domain region ) abrogated the immunohistochemical signal ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Next , we conducted Fer immunohistochemical staining in NSCLC tumor tissue microarrays with matching normal adjacent lung tissue . Fer expression was detectable in normal lung tissues , with highest expression in type II pneumocytes that secrete surfactant ( Fig . 1B ; see arrows within insets ) . Fer was highly expressed in NSCLC tumors , including most adenocarcinomas and squamous carcinomas ( Fig . 1B ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of the immunohistochemical staining ( H score ) revealed a signi ﬁ cant increase in Fer levels in adenocarcinomas or squamous carcinomas compared with normal adjacent lung tissue ( Fig . 1C ) . Together , these results are consistent with high Fer expression in human lung tumors .

MCR - 13 - 0003 - T EGFR - induced Fer activation and localization to lamellipodia in NSCLC cells To identify potential cell models to test Fer signaling and function , a panel of human lung epithelium - derived cell lines was screened for Fer expression . This panel included an immortalized , normal lung epithelial cell lines ( HBE154 , HBE158 , and NL20 ) , and 6 NSCLC cell lines . Fer immu - noblot analysis revealed expression of Fer in normal lung epithelial cell lines , and all NSCLC cell lines tested ( Fig . 2A ) . Because previous studies have implicated Fer in signaling downstream of EGFR ( 4 , 5 ) , we selected H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells that express WT EGFR , and effec - tively model EGFR - driven metastasis in mice ( 29 , 30 ) . To test for EGF - induced activation of Fer in H1299 cells , serum - starved cells were treated with or without EGF for 5 minutes . Following immunoprecipitation of Fer from SCLs , tyrosine phosphorylation ( pY ) of Fer was assessed by immu - noblot . We observed increased Fer pY in EGF - treated cell lysates , consistent with increased EGFR pY in SCLs ( Fig . 2B ; see arrow at 170 kDa ) . Because we observed equal recovery of Fer in the immunoprecipitations ( Fig . 2B , bottom ) , we conclude that Fer signals downstream of EGFR in H1299 NSCLC cells . Fer was recently shown to localize to lamellipodia via N - terminal F - BAR / FX domains that bind the PLD product phosphatidic acid and enhance Ferkinase activation ( 31 ) . To test whether EGFR signaling alters Fer localization in NSCLC , H1299 cells were plated on poly - L - lysine / ﬁ bro - nectin – coated coverslips , serum - starved , and treated with or without EGF for 5 minutes . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining for Fer along with staining of ﬁ lamentous ( F ) - actin and nuclei was conducted before confocal microscopy . In serum - starved H1299 cells , Fer localized within the cytosol ( green ) , and displayed no localization to cortical F - actin ( red ) or the cell nucleus ( Fig . 2C , top ) . Upon EGF treatment , H1299 cells acquired a migratory phenotype featuring a leading edge with broad lamellipodial protrusions ( Fig . 2C , bottom ) . Interestingly , Fer was enriched within F - actin – rich regions of the lamellipodia ( Fig . 2C , see arrows ) . Together , these results are consistent with EGF - induced Fer activation and localization to the leading edge of NSCLC cells undergoing dynamic F - actin polymerization and membrane protrusions . Stable silencing of Fer impairs EGF - induced lamellipodia formation in H1299 NSCLC To probe the function of Fer in NSCLC cells , we selected H1299 cell pools transduced with lentiviruses encoding either a nontargeting shRNA control or shRNAs speci ﬁ c for Fer . Fer expression was analyzed following several cell passages , and this revealed ef ﬁ cient Fer knockdown with shRNA1 ( KD1 ) and shRNA2 ( KD2 ) compared with non - targeting control ( Fig . 3A ) . Densitometry analysis for several cell passages revealed a stable reduction in Fer levels ( relative to tubulin ) by approximately 80 % and 60 % in Fer KD1 , KD2 cell lysates , respectively . To test whether Fer silencing affects growth of H1299 cells , the cell - cycle pro ﬁ les of nontargeting and Fer knock - down cells were compared . Following PI staining of sub - con ﬂ uent H1299 nontargeting and Fer knockdown cells grown in presence of serum , the DNA content of cells was analyzed by ﬂ ow cytometry . No signi ﬁ cant differences were observed for the percentage of cells residing in G 1 , S , or G 2 – M phases of the cell cycle between nontargeting , Fer KD1 , and Fer KD2 ( Fig . 3B ) . Thus , Fer silencing does not regulate growth or survival of H1299 cells . Because we observed Fer localization within EGF - induced lamellipodia in H1299 cells , we compared the proportion of nontargeting and Fer knockdown cells with prominent leading edge lamellipodia marked by F - actin staining . Fol - lowing EGF treatment for 5 minutes , Fer knockdown cells appeared less polarized , and had less extensive F - actin – rich membrane ruf ﬂ es compared with nontargeting control cells ( Fig . 3C ) . Next , we scored the percentage of cells in these Normal A 95 43 170130 95 72 55 95 95 NSCLC IB : Fer IB : pY – + EGF B C IP : Fer IP : Fer IB : pY IB : Fer Actin Fer DAPI Merge S e r u m s t a r v ed E G F ( 50 ng / m L ) : 5 m i n IB : Actin Figure 2 .

MCR - 13 - 0003 - T assays with extensive lamellipodia ( > 50 % of cell periphery ) , and observed signi ﬁ cantly fewer Fer knockdown cells with this migratory phenotype compared with nontargeting con - trol ( Fig . 3D ; P < 0 . 05 ) . Taken together , these results implicate Fer kinase in enhancing EGFR signaling to path - ways promoting lamellipodia formation . Fer phosphorylates Vav2 downstream of EGFR A recent study reported that overexpression of Fer enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the GEF Vav2 and formation of lamellipodia ( 11 ) . Because EGF - induced Vav2 pY was shown to enhance its GEF activity toward Rac GTPase ( 21 ) , we hypothesized that Fer silencing impairs Vav2 pY leading to defects in Rac activation , a key inducer of lamellipodia formation ( 32 ) . To test this , serum - starved H1299 nontargeting and Fer knockdown cells were treated with or without EGF for 5 minutes and then harvested . No overt defect in global pY levels was observed in SCLs from Fer knockdown cells compared with nontargeting control ( Fig . 4A , top ) . EGF treatment led to increased Vav2 pY in both nontargeting and Fer knockdown cells , however , the levels of Vav2 pY were reduced in Fer knockdown cells ( Fig . 4A , third panel ) . This difference was not due to altered levels or recovery of Vav2 in Fer knockdown cells ( Fig . 4A , bottom ) . To complement these ﬁ ndings , and rule out the possibility of off target effects of our shRNAs , we tested Vav2 pY phosphorylation status in MEF from WT ( fer þ / þ ) and homozygous D743R knockin mice ( fer DR / DR ) devoid of Fer kinase activity ( 19 ) , ( 20 ) . MEFs were serum - starved and treated with or without EGF for 5 minutes . As expected , EGF treatment led to increased pY of many prominent proteins in lysates for both genotypes ( Fig . 4B , top ) . As previously reported ( 19 ) , Fer levels were greatly reduced in fer DR / DR MEFs due to instability of Fer DR protein . Although no differences were observed in levels of Vav2 between genotypes , fer DR / DR MEFs showed reduced Vav2 pY upon EGF treatment compared with that observedin fer þ / þ MEFs ( Fig . 4B , second and fourth panels ) . Taken together , these results indicate that EGFR - induced Vav2 pY is partially dependent on Fer kinase in NSCLC and MEFs . Vav2 has 3 tyrosines within an acidic domain , and phosphorylation of these residues leads to enhanced Rac GEF activity ( Supplementary Fig . S2A and S2B ; ref . 33 ) . We predicted that Fer may phosphorylate at least one of these sites , due to the observed partial reduction in Vav2 pY in Fer - de ﬁ cient cells . To address this , we compared Vav2 pY sites with an autophosphorylation site in Fer ( Y402 ) , and that of a known Fer substrate ( cortactin Y421 ; refs . 13 , 20 ) . Of the 3 sites in Vav2 acidic domain , Y172 showed some conserva - tion of acidic residues in þ 1 and þ 2 positions with Fer Y402 and cortactin Y421 ( Supplementary Fig . S2C ) . To test whether Vav2 - Y172 is a target of Fer kinase in NSCLC cells , we subjected lysates from nontargeting , Fer KD1 , and KD2 cell treated with EGF for 0 to 15 minutes to immu - noblot analyses with pY172 - Vav2 antisera . We observed increased Vav2 pY172 within 5 minutes of EGF treatment in nontargeting cells ( Fig . 4C ) .

MCR - 13 - 0003 - T failed to induce detectable Vav2 pY172 in Fer knockdown cells ( Fig . 4C ) . These results are consistent with Fer pro - moting Vav2 pY downstream of EGFR , but do not address whether Vav2 is a direct substrate of Fer . To test this , we conducted in vitro kinase assays with puri ﬁ ed , active Fer and puri ﬁ ed Vav2 N - terminal domain constructs ( GST - Vav2 nontargeting ) with individual or combined mutations of pY sites to phenylalanine ( F ) residues ( Fig . 4D ) . Interestingly , Fer induced Vav2 pY in the WT construct and this was lost in the Y172F - mutant construct ( Fig . 4D ) . Additional muta - tions to Y142 and Y159 did not have an effect in this assay ( Fig . 4D ) , suggesting that Fer speci ﬁ cally phosphorylates Vav2 Y172 in vitro and in NSCLC cells . Fer promotes EGFR signaling to Rac1 GTPase Because phosphorylation of Vav2 Y172 enhances GEF activity toward Rac ( 34 ) , and Vav2 was hypophosphorylated in Fer knockdown NSCLC cells , we tested for potential differences in Rac GTP levels . H1299 cells ( nontargeting , KD1 , KD2 ) were serum - starved and treated with EGF for 5 minutes , and processed for immuno ﬂ uorescence staining with a Rac1 GTP - speci ﬁ c antibody , along with counterstain - ing of F - actin and cell nuclei . Subsequent confocal micros - copy analysis revealed the expected accumulation of Rac1 GTP ( green ) within the F - actin ( red ) – rich lamellipodia in H1299 nontargeting cells treated with EGF ( Fig . 5 , see arrows ) . In contrast , Fer knockdown cells contained a cytosolic pool of Rac1 GTP , which may re ﬂ ect the endosomal pool of this protein ( 35 ) , and only limited Rac1 GTP at the cell periphery was observed ( Fig . 5 ) . These results are consistent with EGFR signaling leading to activation of a membrane - targeted pool of Fer that phosphorylates Vav2 and enhances GTP loading of Rac at leading edge membrane protrusions . Fer silencing impairs NSCLC cell motility and invasion Because Rac1 promotes lamellipodia formation and cell motility ( 36 ) , and Fer silencing impaired EGFR and Vav2 signaling to Rac1 , we tested whether Fer regulates NSCLC cell motility . Initial experiments using a scrape wound – induced cell motility assay , we observed a signi ﬁ cant reduc - tion in wound area closure in Fer knockdown cells ( 55 % and 74 % reductions in KD1 and KD2 , respectively ) compared with nontargeting control cells ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . We further tested the effect of Fer knockdown on cell motility using an adapted EGF - embedded agarose drop chemotaxis assay ( 26 ) to allow simultaneous analysis of H1299 non - targeting and Fer knockdown cells under identical condi - tions . Cell lines were cultured with cell permeable ﬂ uores - cent dyes ( nontargeting , red channel ; Fer knockdown , green channel ) before plating of an equal mixture on poly - L - lysine / ﬁ bronectin – coated coverslips containing an agarose drop enriched with EGF . Time - lapse confocal microscopy was conducted on live cells over 18 hours , and we observed cells around the margin of the agarose drop begin to invade underneath the drop ( Fig . 6A and Supplementary Video S1 ) . Compared with nontargeting control cells , we observed fewer Fer knockdown cells migrating under the agarose drop in multiple separate ﬁ elds of view ( Fig . 6B ; 50 % reduction compared with control ; P < 0 . 05 ) . Analysis of cells migrating under the agarose drop revealed a signi ﬁ cant reduction in cell migration velocity with Fer silencing ( Fig . 6C ; 41 % reduc - tion ; P < 0 . 05 ) . To extend on these results , we compared the invasive properties of H1299 nontargeting and Fer knock - down cells after culturing them in Transwell chambers overlayed with Matrigel . We observed a 75 % reduction in cell invasion in Fer knockdown cells compared with non - targeting control ( Fig . 6D ; P < 0 . 05 ) . To test the role of Fer in another NSCLC cell line , we achieved stable Fer silencing in A549 cells and observed similar defects in wound healing migration and cell invasion in Fer knockdown cells com - pared with nontargeting control ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) .

MCR - 13 - 0003 - T Fer / Vav2 / Rac pathway that promotes directional migration and invasion in NSCLC cells . Fer kinase promotes NSCLC metastasis in vivo To test the in vivo effects of Fer silencing on NSCLC progression and metastasis , we generated subcutaneous tumor xenografts for H1299 nontargeting or Fer knock - down cells in mice lacking NK , B , and T cells ( Rag2 (cid:4) / (cid:4) : g c (cid:4) / (cid:4) ) , that were effective to model metastatic disease ( 37 ) . At 5 weeks postinjection , mice were sacri ﬁ ced and primary tumors and several secondary organs were har - vested . We observed no signi ﬁ cant differences in primary tumor mass in mice injected with nontargeting control cells or Fer knockdown cells ( Fig . 7A ; N ¼ 17 mice / group from 3 separate experiments ) . To test whether Fer silenc - ing was maintained in vivo , tumor homogenates were prepared and analyzed for Fer expression by immunoblot . We observed reduced levels of Fer in 3 separate tumors from Fer KD1 cells compared with nontargeting control tumors ( Fig . 7B ) . Because H1299 cells were previously shown to form spontaneous metastases in mice ( 29 , 30 ) , we screened other organs ( e . g . , lung , liver , etc . ) for GFP - expressing tumor cells . The only tissue in which we consistently observed spontaneous GFP þ metastases was within the lungs ( data not shown ) . Indeed , metastatic nodules were present within lung tissue sections from these mice harboring subcutaneous H1299 tumors ( Fig . 7C , see arrows ) . Upon analysis of serial lung sections from each mouse , we observed signi ﬁ cantly reduced numbers of lung metastases for mice harboring Fer knockdown sub - cutaneous tumors than those with nontargeting control tumors ( Fig . 7D ; P < 0 . 05 ) . Together , these results identify an EGFR / Fer / Vav2 / Rac signaling axis that pro - motes metastasis of NSCLC , and suggests that Fer is a potential therapeutic target for metastatic NSCLC . Discussion Aberrant EGFR signaling is known to drive a number of NSCLC - promoting tumor growth and invasiveness ( 1 ) . In this study , we provide evidence that Fer propagates EGFR signals that enhance cell migration , invasion , and tumor metastasis . EGFR signaling via Fer is facilitated by high level Fer expression in human NSCLC tumors and derived cell lines . In H1299 adenocarcinoma cells , EGFR signaling led to rapid Fer activation and localization to leading edge membrane protrusions . This membrane pool of Fer is functional , as stable silencing of Fer caused defects in EGF - induced lamellipodia formation , cell migration , and invasion . We went on to de ﬁ ne Fer substrates and pathways to explain these defects . Because Fer overexpression was shown to enhance Vav2 pY and Rac - dependent lamellipodia formation ( 11 ) , we tested whether Fer knockdown cells displayed defects in this signaling axis . Indeed , Vav2 was identi ﬁ ed as a direct substrate of Fer , with Y172 identi ﬁ ed as the preferred site . Because EGF - induced Vav2 pY was previously shown to enhance GEF activity toward Rac ( 21 ) , our study implicates Fer in participating in this key pathway at leading edge membrane protrusions . Reduced Rac1 signaling to actin nucleation promoting factors ( e . g . , WAVE ) at these sites may explain the defects in H1299 cell migration ( reduced velocity and persistence ) observed by live cell imaging . Similar results were observed with Fer silencing Actin Rac1 GTP DAPI Merge N T K D 1 K D 2 Figure 5 . Fer promotes Rac1 membrane localization downstream of the EGFR .

MCR - 13 - 0003 - T in A549 NSCLC cells , which displayed reduced motility and cell invasion . The signi ﬁ cance of these defects observed using in vitro assays was tested by conducting tumor xenograft assays in mice using control and Fer knockdown H1299 cells . We observed no effects of Fer silencing on growth of subcutaneous NSCLC tumors , but a signi ﬁ cant defect in numbers of spontaneous lung metastases . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings identify Fer as a key mediator of EGFR signaling in NSCLC that enhances tissue invasion and metastasis pathways . EGFR - induced Fer activation and downstream signaling is likely to involve more than the direct interaction of these proteins , such as production of second messengers that attract Fer and its substrates to the plasma membrane . EGFR activation is known to activate PLD and enhance phospha - tidic acid levels in membrane microdomains ( 31 ) . It is worth noting that both the F - BAR / FX of Fer and the poly - basic C domain of Rac1 bind to phosphatidic acid , leading to Fer activation and reduced Rac1 sequestration by RhoGDI a ( 11 ) , ( 38 ) , ( 39 ) . Fer can also phosphorylate RhoGDI a directly to limit Rac1 binding ( 22 ) . Along with enhanced Vav2 pY , this may also contribute to the ability of Fer to enhance Rac1 GTP at the leading edge protrusions in NSCLC cells ( this article ) . Fer phosphorylates multiple substrates linked to the regulation of actin polymerization . One of these proteins is the actin branching protein cortactin , which is phosphor - ylated by Fer in response to integrin - induced reactive oxygen species and F - actin depolymerization ( 20 ) , ( 40 ) . Defects in cortactin pY may also contribute to the defects in actin - based motility in Fer knockdown NSCLC cells , although no consistent defects in cortactin pY were observed in Fer knockdown H1299 cells ( data not shown ) . However , we do provide evidence for a Fer - mediated Vav2 / Rac pathway that enhances F - actin branching and cell motility via acti - vation of WAVE - Arp2 / 3 complex and inhibition of F - actin severing by co ﬁ lin ( 41 ) , ( 42 ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest that Fer signals through multiple actin polymerization pathways to ultimately promote cell migration and invasion . Although Fer pY was identi ﬁ ed in proteomic studies of lung cancer ( 14 ) , there have been limited studies of Fer function in lung cancer . In addition to our ﬁ ndings linking Fer to NSCLC cell invasion and tumor metastasis , it will be important to further characterize potential roles 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 T ~ 11 h T ~ 14 . 5 h T ~ 18 h T ~ 7 . 5 h T ~ 3 . 5 h T = 0 WT Fer KD 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 A B C D M i g r a t i ng c e ll s / f i e l d I n v aded c e ll s / a r ea V e l o c i t y , µ m / h NT KD1 NT KD1 NT KD1 Figure 6 .

MCR - 13 - 0003 - T of Fer in regulating key transcription factors linked to cancer progression and resistance to potential cancer therapies . Recently , an insertional mutagenesis screen led to the discovery that Fer overexpression confers resistance to quinacrine - induced cell death via enhancing EGFR signaling to NF - k B ( 5 ) . Thus , it will be important to test whether Fer knockdown NSCLC cells display defects in NF - k B target genes that may contribute to NSCLC metastasis . These include NF - k B – induced cell adhesion proteins linked to chemotherapy resistance and lung cancer metastasis ( 43 , 44 ) . Another recent study identi ﬁ ed a Fer / STAT3 pathway that represses expression of laminin binding glycans and glycosyltransferases ( e . g . , LARGE ) that inhibit the motility of carcinomas ( 45 ) . These glycans regulate airway wound - healing responses ( 46 ) . Loss of laminin binding in lung cancers was recently shown to involve downregulation of LARGE , and migration was inhibited following ectopic expression of LARGE ( 47 ) . In future studies , it will be worth testing whether Fer reg - ulates airway wound - healing responses or NSCLC metas - tasis via the STAT3 pathway . Although this study was under review , another group reported that Fer overexpres - sion is associated with poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC that had undergone surgery , and this association was independent of tumor stage , treatment regimen , or EGFR status ( 48 ) . Together with our results implicating Fer in promoting NSCLC metastasis , this lends further support to pursuing Fer as a therapeutic target in NSCLC . Fer is likely to promote the progression or metastasis in other cancer types as well as lung cancer . Recently , Fer was shown to promote prostate cancer progression via an IL - 6 / Fer / STAT3 pathway ( 16 ) . Increased Fer phosphorylation has also been observed in metastatic hepatocellular carcino - mas ( 15 ) and highly metastatic breast cancers ( 17 ) . Because Fer - de ﬁ cient mice have no overt phenotypes ( 19 ) , it is likely to be a drugable target . It is also promising that several inhibitors of Fes kinase were recently identi ﬁ ed and used to inhibit osteoclast differentiation ( 49 ) . On the basis of their high degree of homology , it is likely that at least a subset of Fes inhibitors are also Fer inhibitors , and this will be worth testing in future using preclinical models of metastatic lung cancer and other relevant cancer models . In conclusion , Fer is an emerging therapeutic target to develop additional antimetastasis treatment regimens .
