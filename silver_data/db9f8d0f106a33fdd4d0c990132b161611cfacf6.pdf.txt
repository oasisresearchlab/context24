Malik Peiris , * Tai - Hing Lam , * and Anthony J . Hedley * A total of 1 , 068 asymptomatic close contacts of patients with severe acute respiratory ( SARS ) from the 2003 epidemic in Hong Kong were serologically tested , and 2 ( 0 . 19 % ) were positive for SARS coronavirus immuno - globulin G antibody . SARS rarely manifests as a subclinical infection , and at present , wild animal species are the only important natural reservoirs of the virus . S ince severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and the coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) that causes it have emerged and spread , considerable progress has been made in understanding the biology , pathogenesis , and epidemio - logic features of both the virus and the disease . Epidemiologic studies of hospitalized patients suggest that the overall transmissibility of SARS ( as indicated by the basic reproductive number R 0 = 2 . 7 , 95 % confidence inter - val [ CI ] 2 . 2 – 3 . 7 ) ( 1 ) is relatively low compared to other pathogens . However , such studies could not take into account possible episodes of mild or moderate illness that did not require inpatient medical care and could not address whether asymptomatic community spread played a role in the 2003 epidemic . If this type of spread occurred , sufficient herd immunity against SARS - CoV to protect against another large - scale outbreak might have been developed in the population . The full spectrum of disease associated with SARS - CoV infection should be examined to define more precisely what constitutes a case requiring quarantine and isolation to minimize potential human - to - human spread . Understanding these issues requires the systematic study of the seroprevalence of SARS - CoV anti - body in a large sample stratified by age and other baseline characteristics , especially since children were dispropor - tionately less affected by SARS , both in terms of reduced incidence and severity of infection . Serologic surveys can be based on a random sample from the total population with appropriate stratification , on serum collected for other reasons ( e . g . , blood donors , all hospital admissions ) , or on surveys of persons who resided in sites of superspreading events or who have had close contact with a confirmed SARS patient . We report a serologic survey for immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G against SARS - CoV in a representative sample of close contacts of all SARS patients in Hong Kong ( > 76 % had laboratory confirmation of SARS by either paired serology or repeat reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) according to World Health Organization [ WHO ] criteria [ 2 ] ) . The Study During the epidemic , close contacts were prospectively identified by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Department of Health through stan - dardized telephone interviews with all 1 , 755 confirmed SARS patients within 1 week of hospital admission ( February 15 – June 22 , 2003 ) . A close contact was defined as a person who had cared for , lived with ( in the same household ) , or came into direct contact with body fluids of the SARS patients within 10 days before hospital admis - sion . A total of 3 , 612 close contacts were recorded ; 505 were diagnosed as having SARS . Of the remaining 3 , 107 contacts , 2 , 805 ( 90 % ) had a telephone number available , as reported by the primary patient . We successfully con - tacted 2 , 337 ( 83 % ) from October 23 to November 30 , 2003 , and 1 , 776 ( 57 % of those eligible ) consented to a telephone interview after the purpose of the study was explained to them by trained public health nurses . The interview consisted of questions that assessed the relation - ship between the patients and contacts ; the timing , intensi - ty and frequency of contact ; precautionary measures adopted during contact with the patient ; known contact with other SARS patients ; clinical symptoms of febrile , respiratory , gastrointestinal , or constitutional illness since February 2003 ; medical and travel history ; and sociode - mographic details . Participants were then invited to pro - vide blood samples for serologic testing . Shopping coupons ( worth U . S . $ 25 . 00 ) were given to participants after blood was collected as compensation for time and travel costs . Samples were screened by the Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health by using viral lysate enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ( GBI Biotech , Beijing ) . Positive results were confirmed with immunoflu - orescence assay ( IFA ) and neutralization tests . For the IFA , microscopic slides coated with SARS - CoV – infected Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 10 , No . 9 , September 2004 1653 * University of Hong Kong , Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) , China ; †Department of Health , Hong Kong SAR , China ; and ‡Imperial College , London , England FRhK4 cells were incubated with serum samples at serial twofold dilutions starting from1 : 25 . A positive test is indi - cated by cytoplasmic fluorescence under UV microscopy . By using IFA as the standard , the ELISA detects antibody with IFA titer of > 25 ( i . e . , sensitivity of 100 % ) and has a specificity of 95 % . Neutralization test was performed by standard virologic method with Vero E6 cells and SARS - CoV isolate 6109 . A titer of > 10 was considered positive . The reported sensitivity of 100 % was for convalescent - phase serum samples taken a few weeks after the onset of infection in SARS patients , which should apply to our study . During the early phase of infection , IgM predomi - nates ; the ELISA kit we used detects IgG only . Therefore , the sensitivity is 80 % – 90 % ( depending on the number of days after illness onset when the serum samples were taken ) . However , this sensitivity should not have affected our findings , which were based on tests carried out at least 6 months after the last reported case of SARS in Hong Kong . The study received ethics approval from the Department of Health Ethics Committee , which complies with the Declaration of Helsinki . Results and Conclusions Of the 1 , 068 samples analyzed , 2 ( 0 . 19 % , exact 95 % CI 0 . 02 % – 0 . 67 % ) had a positive titer ( 1 : 25 to 1 : 50 on IFA compared to at least 1 : 100 in most recovered SARS cases ) for SARS - CoV IgG antibody . Neither participant with a positive sample reported a chronic medical condition or being sick with febrile or respiratory illness from February to August . Both seropositive participants arose from two superspreading events in Hong Kong , i . e . , Prince of Wales Hospital nosocomial outbreak and Amoy Gardens environ - mental point source community outbreak ( 1 , 3 ) . The con - tact of the Prince of Wales Hospital seropositive participant reported one other close contact , who was interviewed but declined to be tested . The other seroposi - tive index patient living in Amoy Gardens was separately identified by three intrafamilial index patients , all of whom lived in the same household and reported only each other as close contacts . The participants who consented to test - ing were broadly similar to those who declined , except that the first group had relatively fewer children and fewer of the first group were men ( Table ) . However , those who declined testing were more likely to report more frequent contact and closer relationships with SARS patients , more febrile or respiratory illness episodes since February , and a travel history to SARS - affected regions , which may have biased our seroprevalence estimate upwards . The extent of seroconversion in close contacts of con - firmed patients should provide the upper limit of SARS - CoV antibody seroprevalence in the general population , given the relatively intense exposure history of these per - sons to SARS patients . Our finding of the near absence of transmission resulting in asymptomatic infection in this representative high - risk group of close contacts indicates that the prevailing SARS - CoV strains in Hong Kong almost always led to clinically apparent disease . Whereas some SARS patients , especially healthcare workers , might have been initially admitted to reduce transmission to fam - ily members , virtually all SARS patients ( perhaps with very few exceptions in children [ 4 ] ) had severe disease requiring inpatient treatment ; thus , we can infer that infec - tion with SARS - CoV inevitably caused severe disease requiring hospitalization . Although our results suggest that SARS - CoV was a new virus in humans without a close precursor or an anti - genically related virus that would have induced at least a small degree of cross - reactivity on serologic testing , a recent study on a select group of 938 healthy Hong Kong adults , whose serum had been previously stored as part of a hepatitis B serosurvey in 2001 , indicated that 1 . 8 % of the sample had acquired a SARS - CoV – related virus infection at least 2 years before the 2003 SARS outbreak ( 5 ) . The investigators speculated that the virus that affected these healthy , seropositive persons was antigenically closer to the recently isolated animal SARS - CoV – like virus ( 3 ) than human SARS - CoV , but interspecies transmission from ani - mals to humans was probably inefficient , as the virus might not have adapted in the new host . This hypothesis would explain why only a few persons became infected and why they were likely to have been asymptomatic . This hypothesis would be compatible with the presumed asymptomatic infection observed in Guangdong animal traders , especially in those who handled masked palm civets , who had a seropositivity rate of 72 . 7 % ( exact 95 % CI 49 . 8 % – 89 . 3 % ) in the absence of prior overt clinical dis - ease ( 6 ) . The limitations of the study include incomplete contact tracing , especially in the earlier parts of the epidemic , and potential recall bias from underreporting of contacts by some patients who were too sick to answer questions . Another possible shortcoming is the lack of a survey of close contacts who did not report a telephone number , although there is no reason to suspect they had a systemat - ically different serologic profile . In fact , these were most - ly nonhousehold contacts who would have had less intense exposure to SARS patients . In addition , because peak infectivity , as indicated by viral load , usually occurred dur - ing week 2 of illness ( 7 ) , when most of the patients would have been isolated in hospital ( the mean onset - to - admis - sion interval decreased from a maximum of 9 . 3 days in late February to 1 . 0 day by mid - May ) ( 8 ) , transmission to close contacts in the later stages of the epidemic was less likely . Finally , contacts who refused to participate ( 561 ) or refused to have serologic testing ( 708 ) might have done so because they were concerned about having had SARS DISPATCHES 1654 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www . cdc . gov / eid • Vol . 10 , No . 9 , September 2004 ( possibly because of having had SARS - like symptoms ) and did not want to be identified and stigmatized as having been infected with SARS - CoV . Surveys in other countries with large - scale outbreaks such as Canada , China , Singapore , and Taiwan should be undertaken to confirm our findings .
