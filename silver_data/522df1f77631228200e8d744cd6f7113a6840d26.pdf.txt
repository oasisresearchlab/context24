Introduction Hospitals have had to create new infection prevention and control policies , or adapt current policies , for patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . The spectrum of illness can range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death . 1 Different approaches are available for facilities to identify patients with SARS - CoV - 2 , which include ; testing only those patients who have symptoms , testing those with high risk or testing all patients upon admission ( universal surveillance testing ) . The benefits of the latter include knowing who to isolate in order to prevent transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 to staff and other patients . The disadvantages include increased cost of testing and use of additional resources that may be limited ( e . g . laboratory testing supplies and personal protective equipment ) . Another potential disadvantage is decreased bed capacity if a hospital has semi - private rooms unless positive patients are cohorted . At the University of Louisville Hospital ( UofL Health ) , universal surveillance testing for SARS - CoV - 2 was implemented in April , 2020 . Patients were tested on admission and , if positive , were placed in a specific coronavirus disease - 19 ( COVID - 19 ) unit depending on what level of care they needed . The presence of asymptomatic patients hospitalized in the facility had been identified justifying the continuation of universal surveillance testing . 2 The objective of this study was to define the proportion of asymptomatic patients admitted with SARS - CoV - 2 . Secondary objectives were to define the positivity rate , reasons for admission and the geographic distribution in the region . Materials and Methods This was an observational , descriptive study of all patients admitted to the hospital who were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 from April 9 to July 1 , 2020 ( 12 weeks ) at UofL Health ; an academic acute care trauma hospital in Louisville , KY . Patients were identified using an electronic medical record ( Cerner® , North Kansas City , MO ) and an electronic surveillance system ( TheraDoc® , Charlotte , NC ) . Geographic datasets were used ( ArcMap , Esri® , Redlands , CA ) to visualize the distribution of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in the city . A report was generated including all SARS - CoV - 2 reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) tests with positive and negative results . The list of patients was filtered to remove duplicate results and outpatients . Institutional review board approval was obtained ( IRB # 20 . 0225 ) . Consent was not necessary since data was gathered by retrospective chart review . Information collected for each record included the COVID - 19 RT - PCR test result from a nasopharyngeal swab . One of three RT - PCR instruments were used onsite by the hospital for SARS - CoV - 2 detection ( BD Max™ , Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ; Cepheid® , Sunnyvale , CA ; or Liaison® MDX , Diasorin , Saluggia , Italy ) . Demographics collected included age , sex , race , ethnicity , preferred language , and primary address . Information also collected were comorbidities ( pulmonary , cardiovascular , endocrine , renal , oncologic and other ) , symptoms , as well as physical examination signs . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) defines 11 symptoms for COVID - 19 as fever or chills , cough , shortness of breath or difficulty breathing , fatigue , muscle or body aches , headache , new loss of taste or smell , sore throat , congestion or runny nose , nausea or vomiting , or diarrhea . 3 Symptomatic patients were defined as having any of the 11 symptoms , where as asymptomatic patients did not report any of the 11 symptoms on admission . Symptoms may have been a patient’s chief complaint or discovered in a review of symptoms . Admission diagnoses of asymptomatic patients were also reviewed . All patients admitted to the hospital with positive SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR tests were identified . The patients who had COVID - 19 symptoms on admission were analyzed separately from those who were asymptomatic . Baseline patient characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 patients were compared using  2 test for categorical variables and t - tests test for continuous variables . A P - value of < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Positivity rates and trends were plotted ( Microsoft Excel v16 . 0 ( 2016 ) , Microsoft ? ? , Redmond , WA ) . Results A total of 5081 SARS - CoV - 2 results were reviewed . Of those , 1609 were excluded because they were outpatients , and 590 duplicate results were removed . Of the 2882 that remained , 103 were SARS - CoV - 2 positive ( Figure 1 ) The proportion of positive samples among the 2882 tested over time varied between 1 - 6 % . ( Figure 2 ) Among the 103 positive SARS - CoV - 2 patients , 65 ( 63 % ) patients were symptomatic and 38 ( 37 % ) patients were asymptomatic . The proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 patients who were asymptomatic varied over the duration of the study but trended up from 20 % at the onset of the study period to 60 % at the end ( Figure 3 ) . 5081 Test results for SARS - CoV - 2 103 Positive patients 2882 Unique patients 590 Duplicate patients 1609 Outpatient results 2779 Negative patients 38 Asymptomatic patients 65 Symptomatic patients Figure 1 Among all patients who were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 , 2882 were admitted and 103 were positive .

Figure 3 Among hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 ( left y axis ) , the positivity rate ( right y axis ) for those who were symptomatic versus asymptomatic is displayed per week . Demographics for the 103 positive patients are identified in Table 1 . Asymptomatic patients were significantly younger and had a lower body mass index ( BMI ) . A higher proportion of pregnant asymptomatic patients spoke Spanish as a preferred language . Reasons for admission of the 38 asymptomatic patients were active labor ( 55 % ) , trauma ( 26 % ) , burn / wound ( 5 % ) and other ( 13 % ) . Predominant and comprehensive symptoms of the symptomatic patients were also reviewed . ( Table 2 ) Symptomatic patients with COVID - 19 were more likely to have COPD , asthma or any other comorbidity . Geographic datasets identified clusters of SARS - CoV - 2 within the city of Louisville , and specific groups of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients . ( Figure 4 ) The comparison of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients identified in the geographic dataset showed no obvious differences between the two groups and their residency locations within the city .

Solid circles represent symptomatic patients and grey circles represent asymptomatic patients . The size of a circle correlates to the number of patients from each area . Discussion Approximately one third of admitted patients positive for SARS - CoV - 2 during a 12 - week period of the 2020 pandemic were asymptomatic . This is the first study to identify the proportion of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID - 19 patients from an acute care setting . Asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 patients sought care for non - COVID - 19 related reasons and were only identified due to universal surveillance testing . The most common reasons for admission of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 patients were labor and trauma . Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients came from all areas of the region and did not appear to be localized . Known risk factors for COVID - 19 include persons frequently in congregate settings with an increased likelihood of close contact . The risk factors were exemplified in our population as pregnancy , poverty and crowding . These clusters represented a group of pregnant Hispanic patients from one area , and additional clusters of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in densely populated urban parts of the city . This type of information could contribute to outbreak investigations by a health department . The primary implication of this study is that SARS - CoV - 2 is not always clinically detectable based on presentation of signs and symptoms . An important strategy to protect healthcare workers and other patients is to perform a surveillance test on all patients admitted to the hospital . In addition to surveillance testing for SARS - CoV - 2 , other strategies utilized were standard and transmission - based precautions , as well as universal masking of all staff . In the midst of a pandemic with a local positivity rate of ~ 5 % , a mortality of ~ 3 % , a paucity of treatment options , and the absence of a vaccine , the implementation of these practices was supported . The proportion of asymptomatic patients may change as the positivity rate changes in a local area . If it were to increase , presumably there would be more beds occupied with symptomatic COVID - 19 patients , thus decreasing the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic patients . The proportion for the subpopulation of trauma and labor and delivery patients , however would likely stay the same , regardless of the positivity rate , since other issues drive them to the hospital . After recovery from a pandemic , the numbers of SARS - CoV - 2 patients would likely be too small to be statistically meaningful . It appears that asymptomatic positive people fueled the pandemic to persist for months . 4 , 5 The reason that we currently isolate asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 patients in the hospital is based on the indirect finding that they shed live virus . Thus , the premise of isolating asymptomatic positive patients is to contain the shedding of live virus . What is known is that a positive RT - PCR test doesn’t necessarily confer that live virus is present . Culturing live virus would confer that , but is burdensome and complicated . A cheaper and quicker , but less accurate , way to determine if someone is shedding live virus is to know how many cycles the RT - PCR instrument took to detect SARS - CoV - 2 , if positive . Most instruments have a cycle threshold ( Ct ) for reporting positive as < 40 cycles . The more cycles it took an instrument to detect the virus , the less likely there was live virus present 4 At least three studies discuss linking the contagiousness of an asymptomatic patient and their cycle threshold values . This is important because they provide data that supports the recommendation from Infection Prevention and Control Departments to isolate asymptomatic patients testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . First , the cycle thresholds of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients on the Diamond Princess were comparable , thus supporting a similar degree of contagiousness and the need to identify and isolate both populations . 5 Second , SARS - CoV - 2 identified with RT - PCR in asymptomatic patients , detected it with cycle thresholds as low as 21 . 9 . 6 Third , two of 114 asymptomatic travelers from Wuhan to Frankfurt , Germany tested positive and had viral growth of their samples . 7 Studies have identified the proportion of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals in a variety of populations . A study from Chongqing , China reported 167 patients admitted who were positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . 10 Twenty patients ( 12 % ) were asymptomatic , but the study did not report if they were consecutive patients or report why they were tested if they didn’t have symptoms ( clinical suspicion versus surveillance ) . Surveillance testing was performed in four long - term care facilities by the San Francisco Department of Public Health in response to COVID - 19 outbreaks . Between March 30 - April 30 of 2020 , the rate of positivity among those tested ( residents and employees ) was 50 % ( 214 / 431 ) . Of those , 40 % ( 86 / 214 ) were asymptomatic – 63 residents and 23 employees . 9 In a similar study , among 76 residents of a long - term care skilled nursing facility who were tested for SARS - CoV - 2 , 23 were positive with 13 ( 57 % ) asymptomatic residents . 6 The study reviewing those tested on the Diamond Princess that was isolated in Japanese waters early in the pandemic in February 2020 ; had 3 , 711 people on board , of whom 82 % were tested and 634 ( 21 % ) were positive . Among the positive people , 328 ( 52 % ) were asymptomatic . 5 The city of Vo’ , Italy was the first town to have a death related to COVID - 19 in Italy . Of the 3 , 275 residents , 86 % were tested and 73 ( 2 . 6 % ) were positive . Among the positive citizens of Vo’ , 29 ( 40 % ) were asymptomatic . 10 The proportions from these studies are summarized in table 3 .

Multiple PCR testing instruments were used , which range in sensitivities for SARS - CoV - 2 detection from 83 to ≥95 % . Using the CDC definition of symptoms for COVID - 19 may have resulted in some patients being miscategorized due to the inability to adequately attribute signs and symptoms to COVID - 19 . For example ; some patients fulfilled the CDC criteria , but a more significant contributing factor was present , such as a symptomatic patient with shortness of breath who had been kicked in the chest by a horse ( false positive ) . Alternatively , some patients did not meet criteria due to an inability to collect a complete assessment of signs and symptoms , such as an asymptomatic patient with expressive aphasia who was unable to verbalize COVID - 19 symptoms ( false negative ) . Considering the retrospective nature of this study , we were reliant on clinician assessments which varied by provider . Therefore , a rigorous chart review for symptoms was performed rather than merely using the chief complaint or billing codes to categorize patients . The study was strengthened by the longitudinal , rather than point - prevalence , assessment of the data over 12 weeks . Among all the patients admitted to the hospital over 12 weeks that tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , 37 % were asymptomatic in this acute care setting . These patients were characterized by lower body mass index , lower age and were primarily admitted for trauma or labor . Having a universal surveillance testing policy in place to test everyone admitted during the COVID - 19 pandemic likely prevented exposure and development of hospital - acquired COVID - 19 cases among healthcare workers and other patients . Acute care facilities should consider universal surveillance testing on admission to identify all positive patients – symptomatic or asymptomatic . References 1 .
