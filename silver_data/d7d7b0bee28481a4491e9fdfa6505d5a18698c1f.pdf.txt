The struc - tures of these Ir fragments were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy , analytical ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy . Deletion mapping identiﬁed a distinct 14 residue site within the Ir coiled coil , Arg311 – Asp324 , which was absolutely necessary for dimer formation , indicating that heptad repeats alone are not sufﬁcient for stable coiled - coil formation . More - over , deletion of the six N - terminal heptad repeats of Ir led to the formation of a four - rather than a two - helix structure , suggesting that the full - length cortexillin I coiled - coil domain behaves as a cooperative folding unit . Most interestingly , a 16 residue peptide containing the distinct coiled - coil ‘trigger’ site Arg311 – Asp324 yielded ~ 30 % helix formation as monomer , in aqueous solution . pH titration and NaCl screening experiments revealed that the peptide’s helicity depends strongly on pH and ionic strength , indicating that electrostatic interactions by charged side chains within the peptide are critical in stabilizing its monomer helix . Taken together , these ﬁndings demonstrate that Arg311 – Asp324 behaves as an autonomous helical folding unit and that this distinct Ir segment controls the process of coiled - coil formation of cortexillin I . Keywords : analytical ultracentrifugation / autonomous helical folding unit / circular dichroism spectroscopy / electron microscopy / heptad repeats Introduction Subunit oligomerization of many proteins is mediated by coiled - coil domains ( Lupas , 1996 ; Kammerer , 1997 ; Kohn et al . , 1997 ) . Typically , coiled coils consist of two to ﬁve right - handed amphipatic α - helices which coil around each other to form a slightly left - handed supercoil . Polypeptide segments giving rise to coiled coils are characterized by so - called heptad repeats of seven amino acid residues , denoted a to g ( Sodek et al . , 1972 ; McLachlan and © Oxford University Press 1883 Stewart , 1975 ; Cohen and Parry , 1990 ) . The residues at positions a and d are mostly apolar , thereby forming a 3 , 4 - hydrophobic repeat with charged residues occurring frequently at the e and g positions . The hallmark of coiled coils is the distinctive packing of amino acid side chains in the hydrophobic core of the helix bundles , called ‘knobs - into - holes’ packing , which was ﬁrst described by Crick ( 1953 ) . Accordingly , hydrophobic interactions appear to represent the major driving force in stabilizing a coiled coil ( Harbury et al . , 1993 ) . Ionic interactions between the side chains of neighboring helices are con - sidered relevant to the stability , orientation and stoichio - metry of coiled coils ( O’Shea et al . , 1992 ; Monera et al . , 1994 ; Zhou et al . , 1994 ; Beck et al . , 1997 ) . The simplicity and regularity of the coiled - coil structural motif have made it an attractive system for exploring some of the fundamental features of protein folding and protein – protein interactions . Moreover , coiled coils have been the focus of de novo protein design , a research area which has recently become important in attempts to rationally design multi - stranded coiled coils for a variety of purposes , including medical applications such as the targeting and delivery of drugs by heterodimerization technology , the engineering of synthetic biosensors and carrier molecules , and the discovery of new drugs ( for a review see Hodges , 1996 ) . Although the parameters which determine the state of oligomerization and the stability of coiled coils are well known , only limited information is currently available on the mechanistic details leading to the formation of this apparently simple structural motif . Studies on the folding of coiled coils have primarily focused on tropomyosin , myosin and leucine zipper peptides , all producing two - helix structures . Thermodynamic and kinetic studies with leucine zippers suggested that their unfolding follows a simple two - state mechanism ( Thompson et al . , 1993 ; Wendt et al . , 1995 , 1997 ; Sosnick et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , the unfolding of the much longer coiled - coil domains of tropomyosin ( Lehrer , 1978 ) and skeletal muscle myosin ( King et al . , 1995 ) were reported to be non - two - state reactions indicating that these coiled coils may consist of discrete , independently stable subdomains . Kinetic studies using stopped - ﬂow techniques with tropomyosin ( Mo et al . , 1991 , 1992 ) , the leucine zipper domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 ( a 33 residue peptide denoted GCN4 - p1 ; Zitzewitz et al . , 1995 ; Sosnick et al . , 1996 ) , and other leucine zipper peptides ( Wendt et al . , 1995 , 1997 ) suggested a fast bimolecular association step . However , none of these investigations established the mechanistic details underlying the folding pathway of coiled coils which in turn would not only be of theoretical but also , as mentioned above , of considerable practical value . In this context , a rather puzzling , frequently made M . O . Steinmetz et al . observation is that relatively long heptad - repeat - containing polypeptide chain fragments derived from stable coiled - coil domains fail to associate into coiled - coil structures . For example , Trybus et al . ( 1997 ) have recently reported that smooth muscle myosin fragments with as many as 15 heptad repeats of the coiled - coil rod sequence failed to dimerize . This failure cannot be simply explained by instability due to the type of residues occupying the a and d positions of the heptad repeats , or by electrostatic repulsion of the two chains . As it is not known what factors determine chain association , the failure of chain assembly raises the question of whether there exist distinct sites within heptad - repeat - containing amino acid sequences which are necessary to mediate or initiate coiled - coil formation . We have addressed this question in detail by using the two - stranded coiled - coil oligomeriz - ation domain of cortexillin I ( Ir ) , an actin cross - linking protein from Dictyostelium discoideum ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) . For this purpose , we produced a variety of fragments of Ir by heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli , and investigated their structures and oligomeric states by circular dichroism ( CD ) spectroscopy , electron microscopy ( EM ) and analytical ultracentrifugation ( AUC ) . Our data document that a distinct 14 residue segment exists within Ir that is absolutely required to mediate proper assembly of Ir into a parallel homodimeric coiled coil . Using a 16 residue synthetic peptide ( cI - t ) , we further demonstrate that this coiled - coil ‘trigger’ site represents an autonomous helical folding unit . These novel ﬁndings suggest that coiled - coil formation is controlled by a helical trigger site ( s ) . Results The oligomerization domain of cortexillin I forms a tightly packed , two - stranded , parallel coiled coil Electron microscopic evidence , together with sequence analysis of cortexillin I predicting 18 continuous heptad repeats within its C - terminus , suggested that assembly of the parallel dimeric molecule is mediated by a coiled - coil oligomerization domain ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) . To test this hypothesis , we produced a recombinant polypeptide chain fragment corresponding to the predicted full - length oligo - merization domain comprising residues 227 – 352 of D . dis - coideum cortexillin I in E . coli ( Figure 1A and B ) . The homogeneity of the afﬁnity - puriﬁed recombinant protein was assessed by tricine - SDS – PAGE ( Figure 1C , lane 1 ) which revealed a single band consistent in size with the calculated molecular mass of the Ir monomer ( 15 . 0 kDa ) , with no obvious degradation products detected . The oligomeric state of the recombinant Ir molecule was assessed by AUC . As shown in Table I , at 20°C in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 150 mM NaCl , the sedimentation equilibrium of Ir revealed an average molecular mass of 27 . 5 kDa , and sedimentation velocity yielded a sedimentation coefﬁcient of 2 . 1S . These values are consistent with a dimeric rod - shaped conform - ation of Ir . Inspection of the Ir molecules by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) after glycerol - spraying and rotary metal - shadowing yielded uniformly appearing , rod - shaped particles ( Figure 2 ) . The apparent length of the molecules was measured and put into a histogram ( Figure 2 , inset ) . 1884 Fig . 1 . Design and preparation of N - and C - terminal deletion constructs from Ir .

The migration of marker proteins is given on the right in kDa . A Gaussian ﬁt of the histogram revealed a mean length of 19 . 2 (cid:2) 2 nm . This value is consistent with the mean length found for the tail domain of the native cortexillin I molecule ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) as well as the calculated length of ~ 19 nm for a two - stranded , α - helical coiled - coil consisting of 18 continuous heptad repeats ( with the assumption that the axial rise per residue corresponds to 1 . 485 Å ; Fraser et al . , 1964 ) . Far - ultraviolet ( UV ) CD spectroscopy was employed to probe for the secondary structure of Ir . At 5°C and a total chain concentration of 35 μ M , the CD spectrum recorded from Ir ( Figure 3A ) was characteristic for an α - helical coiled - coil structure exhibiting minima at 208 and 222 nm Identiﬁcation of a coiled - coil trigger site Table I .

Based on a [ Θ ] 222 value of – 35 400 deg . cm 2 / dmol ( Table I ) , a helical content of (cid:3) 90 % was estimated by assuming that a value of – 37 300 deg . cm 2 / dmol corresponds to a helicity of 100 % for a 130 residue polypeptide chain fragment ( Chen et al . , 1974 ) . As expected for a non - covalently bonded , two - stranded α - helical coiled coil , the CD signal at 222 nm was concentration - dependent ( data not shown ) . The stability of the recombinant two - stranded α - helical coiled coil was assessed by thermal unfolding proﬁles recorded by CD at 222 nm . As shown in Figure 3B , at a total chain concentration of 35 μ M , Ir revealed a single sharp melting proﬁle characteristic for a cooperative helix – coil transition with a melting temperature ( T m ) of 64°C . The thermal unfolding proﬁle was monophasic and revers - ible with (cid:3) 95 % of the starting signal being recovered upon cooling ( data not shown ) . To assess whether the hydrophobic core of the coiled coil was tightly packed , binding of the ﬂuorescent dye 1 - anilino - 8 - naphthalenesulfonate ( ANS ) to Ir was tested ( Stryer , 1965 ; Jelesarov and Bosshard , 1996 ) . Native proteins bind ANS weakly unless there is a solvent - accessible nonpolar region . At 20°C , addition of a 1 - to 5 - fold molar excess of ANS to a 35 μ M Ir solution revealed an increase of the total ﬂuorescence signal of (cid:4) 10 % ( data not shown ) indicating no signiﬁcant binding of the dye to the coiled coil . To determine whether the helix orientation in the isolated two - stranded coiled - coil domain was parallel , as in the case of the native full - length cortexillin I molecule ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) , we recombinantly synthesized an Ir variant 1885 Fig . 2 .

Non - reducing SDS – PAGE revealed a single ~ 30 kDa protein band , demonstrating that the two Ir chains assemble into a parallel dimer ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that Ir associ - ates into a tightly packed two - stranded , parallel , α - helical coiled coil which behaves as a single cooperative folding unit . This ﬁnding conﬁrms the suggestion made by Faix et al . ( 1996 ) that the cortexillins represent a fourth class of molecules within the α - actinin / spectrin superfamily whose members are deﬁned by a common F - actin binding motif , but are distinct from each other mainly in the design and architecture of their oligomerization domain ( Matsudaira , 1991 ) . A distinct 14 residue site is necessary for coiled - coil formation of Ir Ir was used as a model system to address the question of whether coiled - coil formation starts preferentially at a distinct site . Towards this goal , our strategy was to produce a number of Ir fragments and assess their ability to form coiled - coil structures by AUC and CD . First we produced , by heterologous gene expression in E . coli , four recombin - ant polypeptide chain fragments comprising the ﬁrst six and twelve N - terminal ( Ir - 12hC and Ir - 6hC , respectively ) and the last six and twelve C - terminal ( Ir - 12hN and Ir - 6hN , respectively ) heptad repeats of Ir ( Figure 1B and C ) . As the minimum length required for the formation of stable coiled coils has been reported to be in the range of 21 – 23 residues ( Lumb et al . , 1994 ; Su et al . , 1994 ; Fairman et al . , 1995 ) , these recombinant fragments were expected to be long enough to fold into stable coiled - coil structures . The homogeneity of the afﬁnity - puriﬁed recombinant polypeptide chain fragments was assessed by tricine - SDS – PAGE , which revealed single bands with M . O . Steinmetz et al . Fig . 3 .

The same color code as for the spectra displayed in ( A ) and ( C ) was used . The total chain concentration was 35 μ M for all seven fragments in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 150 mM NaCl . mobilities corresponding to their calculated monomer molecular masses ( Table I ) , with no degradation products detected ( Figure 1C ) . Deletion of six ( Ir - 6hC ) or twelve ( Ir - 12hC ) heptad repeats from the C - terminus of Ir completely abolished coiled - coil formation . AUC analysis of both Ir - 6hC and Ir - 12hC yielded average molecular masses of 10 . 3 and 4 . 9 kDa , respectively , which are consistent with the calculated monomer molecular masses ( Table I ) . Surpris - ingly , Ir - 6hC revealed a CD spectrum indicating a substan - tial amount of helicity at 5°C ( Figure 3C , green curve ) . However , its CD spectrum was characteristic for partial monomer helix formation as evidenced by its insigniﬁcant 1886 concentration dependence ( data not shown ) , a shift of the minimum from 208 to 205 nm and a [ Θ ] 222 : [ Θ ] 205 ratio of (cid:4) 1 . Moreover , its corresponding thermal unfolding proﬁle exhibited a very broad , non - cooperative transition ( Figure 3D , green curve ) . Finally , glycerol - sprayed / rotary metal - shadowed Ir - 6hC molecule samples produced speci - mens which appeared rather heterogeneous in the EM in terms of particle size and shape ( data not shown ) . Ir - 12hC , on the other hand , revealed a CD spectrum at 5°C typical for proteins in a random coil conformation with a pronounced minimum at 200 nm ( Figure 3C , black curve ) . As expected , this Ir fragment yielded no signiﬁcant thermal unfolding proﬁle ( Figure 3D , black curve ) . Identiﬁcation of a coiled - coil trigger site In contrast , deletion of six ( Ir - 6hN ) or twelve ( Ir - 12hN ) heptad repeats from the N - terminal end of Ir did not signiﬁcantly affect coiled - coil formation ( Figure 3C and D , magenta and cyan curves ; Table I ) . Both fragments yielded concentration - dependent CD spectra characteristic for α - helical coiled - coil structures ( Figure 3C ) , and the corresponding thermal unfolding proﬁles at a chain con - centration of 35 μ M exhibited cooperative transitions with T m s of 63 and 27°C for Ir - 6hN and Ir - 12hN , respectively ( Figure 3D ; Table I ) . Rather surprisingly , sedimentation equilibrium revealed that the Ir - 6hN fragment forms a tetramer ( Table I ) . Electron micrographs of glycerol - sprayed / rotary metal - shadowed Ir - 6hN yielded uniformly distributed , elongated particles which appeared shorter but somewhat thicker than corresponding Ir particles ( data not shown ) . An average molecular length of 12 . 8 (cid:2) 1 . 2 nm was determined for Ir - 6hN , which is exactly two - thirds of the full - length Ir molecule . Together with the data obtained by CD , these ﬁndings suggest a four - stranded , most likely unstaggered coiled - coil structure of Ir - 6hN . Based on these ﬁndings , we next focused our attention on the last six C - terminal heptad repeats ( Arg311 – Arg352 ) of Ir . To map more precisely the critical site for coiled - coil formation , we prepared chain variants missing two ( Ir - 2hC ) , three ( Ir - 3hC ) , four ( Ir - 4hC ) or ﬁve ( Ir - 5hC ) heptad repeats from the C - terminus of Ir ( Figure 1B and C ) . Deletions of up to four heptad repeats from the C - terminus of Ir retained the ability of the corresponding Ir fragments for coiled - coil formation ( Figure 3E and F ; Table I ) . Ir - 2hC ( red curve ) , Ir - 3hC ( data not shown ) and Ir - 4hC ( blue curve ) all had features reminiscent of two - stranded coiled - coil structures as revealed by their α - helical CD spectra ( all concentration - dependent ; data not shown ) , cooperative thermal unfolding proﬁles ( T m values of 55 , 53 and 51°C , respectively , at a chain concentration of 35 μ M ; Table I ) , and AUC sedimentation velocity proﬁles and sedimentation equilibrium boundaries characteristic for elongated dimeric molecules ( Table I ) . In contrast , whereas Ir - 5hC ( Figure 3E and F , black curve ) still yielded a mixture of monomers and dimers , deletion of more than ﬁve heptad repeats from the C - terminus of Ir resulted in the complete loss of homodimer formation as revealed by AUC ( see above and Table I ) . Taken together , deletion mapping identiﬁed a distinct 14 residue site , Arg311 – Asp324 , which was absolutely necessary to trigger the assembly of the oligomerization domain of cortexillin I into a two - stranded , parallel , α - helical coiled coil . To conﬁrm our ﬁndings further , we prepared two cortexillin I fragments , cI - 310 and cI - 324 , which were designed so as to contain the N - terminal globular head domain ( residues 1 – 226 ) together with 12 ( cI - 310 ) or 14 ( cI - 324 ) heptad repeats of its coiled - coil domain . Remarkably , electron micrographs of glycerol - sprayed / rotary metal - shadowed cI - 310 molecules which were missing the critical sequence Arg311 – Asp324 yielded uniformly distributed , apparently monomeric globular par - ticles ( Figure 4A ) . The 4 – 6 nm diameter particles evidently represented the N - terminal actin - binding domain ( residues 1 – 226 of cortexillin I ; Faix et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , cI - 324 , which differs from cI - 310 only in the critical 14 residues Arg311 – Asp324 revealed dimeric molecules con - sisting of two globular heads attached to one end of a ~ 15 nm long stalk ( Figure 4B ) . With the exception of a 1887 Fig . 4 . Electron micrographs of glycerol - sprayed / rotary metal - shadowed recombinant ( A ) cI - 310 and ( B ) cI - 324 cortexillin I fragments which were designed so as to contain the N - terminal globular head domain ( residues 1 – 226 ) and 12 or 14 heptad repeats , respectively , of the coiled - coil oligomerization domain , Ir . Scale bars , 50 nm for low magniﬁcation overviews and 25 nm for high magniﬁcation gallery . ~ 4 nm shorter rod , the overall morphology of the dimeric cI - 324 particles appeared very similar to that of glycerol - sprayed / rotary metal - shadowed native cortexillin I ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) . These EM - based ﬁndings were conﬁrmed by AUC measurements yielding average molecular masses of 37 . 1 kDa ( calculated monomer mass 35 . 4 kDa ) for cI - 310 and 71 . 0 kDa ( calculated monomer mass 37 . 1 kDa ) for cI - 324 ( Table I ) . The coiled - coil ‘trigger’ site represents an autonomous helical folding unit To characterize the coiled - coil trigger site further , we synthesized the 16 residue peptide Ac - ARMELEARLAK - TEKDR - NH 2 ( Ala310 – Arg325 ) , denoted cI - t , and ana - lyzed its structure and oligomeric state by CD and AUC . As illustrated in Figure 5A , at 3°C and in 1 mM sodium phosphate , pH 7 . 4 , the far - UV CD spectrum of cI - t was characteristic for partial helix formation with well - deﬁned minima at 222 nm ( α - helix n – π * transition ) and 203 nm ( mixture of α - helix π – π | | * transition and random coil π – π * transition ) . Helix formation by the peptide was monomolecular as shown by AUC ( Table I ) and the lack of any signiﬁcant concentration dependence of [ Θ ] 222 in the range of 20 – 200 μ M ( data not shown ) . Based on the [ Θ ] 222 value of – 9200 deg . cm 2 / dmol , a helical content of ~ 30 % was estimated by assuming that a value of – 30 000 deg . cm 2 / dmol corresponds to 100 % helicity for a 16 residue peptide ( Chen et al . , 1974 ) . The monomeric helix formed by cI - t unfolds rapidly with increasing temperature as evidenced by a shift in wavelength of the minimum from 203 to 200 nm at higher temperatures and a concomitant decrease of – [ Θ ] 222 ( Figure 5A ) . The helix content of cI - t has also been measured as a function of pH and ionic strength . The helix content of cI - t at 3°C was strongly pH - dependent : – [ Θ ] 222 decreased moderately as the pH was raised above 2 and decreased signiﬁcantly as the pH was increased above 11 ( Figure 5B , M .

This pH effect was drastically attenuated at 50°C where the helix was largely melted ( Figure 5B , ﬁlled symbols ) . A strong decrease in the helix content of cI - t was also observed upon raising the ionic strength from 0 to 2 M NaCl ( Figure 5C ) . Throughout the pH range and salt concentrations evaluated , helix formation remained temperature - dependent and occurred in a monomolecular reaction . These results suggest that electrostatic inter - actions of charged amino acid side chains are critical in stabilizing the cI - t monomer helix . Discussion A coiled - coil trigger site is absolutely necessary for chain assembly of cortexillin I The two - stranded parallel coiled coil is the simplest representative of multi - subunit proteins with only one type of secondary - and a well - deﬁned quartenary - structure . This structural motif has been used extensively as a model system for studying both the intra - and intermolecular interactions which govern the folding and stability of multimeric proteins . As a consequence of ( i ) thermo - dynamic studies of naturally occurring coiled - coil proteins ( Lehrer , 1978 ; O’Shea et al . , 1989 ) , ( ii ) the design and characterization of simple peptides of diverse length and 1888 sequence ( for a review see Betz et al . , 1995 ) , and ( iii ) determination of the crystal structure of a number of coiled - coil proteins ( Malashkevich et al . , 1996 ; for review see Lupas , 1996 ; Kohn et al . , 1997 ) , the interactions which stabilize coiled coils and specify their oligomerization state are now fairly well understood . Information on the mechanistic details of the coiled - coil assembly process , however , has remained rather limited . For example , the observation that fragments of considerable length derived from stable coiled - coil domains failed to oligomerize ( Trybus et al . , 1997 ) has been difﬁcult to explain . For this reason , we have addressed the question of whether there exist distinct sites within coiled coils which are necessary to mediate chain assembly of heptad - repeat - containing segments . We have chosen the coiled - coil oligomerization domain of D . discoideum Ir as a model polypeptide for the following three reasons ( for details see Results ) . ( i ) Ir forms a tightly packed parallel homodimer which represents the simplest type of coiled - coil structure . ( ii ) The full - length Ir domain is of intermediate size and is exceptional in the sense that it consists of 18 continuous heptad repeats which are not interrupted by any dis - continuities such as stutters , stammers or skip residues ( Brown et al . , 1996 ) . Generally , in two - stranded coiled coils the average length of a continuous heptad - repeat segment is only ~ 80 residues ( i . e . 11 – 12 heptad repeats ; Conway and Parry , 1991 ) . As the minimum length required for the formation of stable coiled coils has been reported to be in the range of 21 – 23 residues ( Lumb et al . , 1994 ; Su et al . , 1994 ; Fairman et al . , 1995 ) , our recombinant Ir fragments ( Figure 1B ) were expected to be long enough to fold into stable coiled - coil structures . ( iii ) Ir exhibits cooperative , two - state unfolding and refolding , which suggests that the dimer represents a uniform and entire folding domain . Using a systematic N - and C - terminal deletion mapping strategy ( Figure 1 ) we have identiﬁed a 14 residue segment , Arg311 – Asp324 , which was absolutely required for triggering oligomerization of cortexillin I . Deletion of this speciﬁc coiled - coil trigger site completely abolished dimerization of up to 12 heptad repeat long Ir fragments . This ﬁnding may explain why in some cases the presence of heptad repeats is not sufﬁcient to mediate stable coiled - coil formation ( Trybus et al . , 1997 ) . Finally , the observation that Ir - 4hC and Ir - 12hN formed stable coiled - coil structures indicates that folding can occur from the trigger site in both the N - and C - terminal directions . Deletion of N - terminal heptad repeats alters the state of oligomerization of Ir Deletion of the ﬁrst six N - terminal heptad repeats of Ir ( Ir - 6hN ) yielded tetramers , as revealed by AUC . Moreover , CD thermal unfolding proﬁles exhibited a monophasic cooperative transition , and AUC measurements at varying ionic strength ( data not shown ) suggested a four - stranded coiled - coil structure for Ir - 6hN rather than a tetramer formed by the association of two two - stranded coiled coils . In agreement with this suggestion , inspection of metal - shadowed Ir - 6hN specimens by TEM revealed rod - shaped particles whose length was consistent with the calculated length of ~ 13 nm for an unstaggered four - stranded coiled coil consisting of four 86 residue chains . The formation of different oligomerization states of Identiﬁcation of a coiled - coil trigger site coiled coils was explained in terms of packing geometries of the a and d position amino acid side chains in the hydrophobic core ( Harbury et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) . However , it has recently been documented that the e and g positions ﬂanking the a and d sites can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the oligomerization speciﬁcity of coiled coils . For example , by replacing a single amino acid residue at the heptad positions e ( Kammerer et al . , 1998 ) or g ( Beck et al . , 1997 ) within the coiled - coil domains of tenascin - C and matrillin I , these authors observed a switch from three - to four - stranded coiled - coil structures . The hydrophobic interface of four - stranded coiled coils is more extended relative to that of dimers and trimers ( Harbury et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) : the e and g sites in the tetramer are almost as deeply buried as the a and d positions in the dimer ( Harbury et al . , 1993 ) . As hydrophobic packing is the major driving force of coiled - coil formation , removal of particular heptad repeats or even substitution of single amino acid residues may allow for a more favorable packing of the e and g residues in the tetramer conform - ation . Moreover , the tetramer also exhibits several types of interchain ionic interactions that are not observed in the dimer ( g to b (cid:5) and c to e (cid:5) , i . e . between residue i in one chain and residue i (cid:5)(cid:6) 2 in the neighboring chain ; Harbury et al . , 1993 , 1994 ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings suggest that the full - length cortexillin I coiled - coil domain behaves as a cooperative folding unit and that its oligomerization state is speciﬁed by the arrangement and number of heptad repeats . Deletion of particular heptad repeat segments distinct from the coiled - coil trigger site alters this context , and therefore may result in a switch of the oligomeriz - ation state . The coiled - coil trigger site of cortexillin I represents an autonomous helical folding unit Most interestingly , we found that the 16 residue cI - t peptide which contains the coiled - coil trigger site ( Arg311 – Asp324 ) of Ir folded into a monomeric helix exhibiting 30 % helicity at 3°C and pH 7 . 4 . Generally such short peptides are not stable in aqueous solution unless they contain a special sequence ( for review see Scholtz and Baldwin , 1992 ; Dyson and Wright , 1993 ) . Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of cI - t revealed that 11 out of 16 residues occur with high frequencies in α - helices ( A , R , K , L and M ) . These residues are known to exhibit the strongest helical propensities among all naturally occurring amino acids ( Parthasarathy et al . , 1995 ) . Further - more , helix formation by cI - t was strongly dependent on pH and ionic strength . Variation of these parameters revealed differences in helicity of up to a factor of two , demonstrating that electrostatic interactions ( e . g . charge – helix dipole interactions or electrostatic side - chain – side - chain interactions ) are critical for stabilizing the cI - t monomer helix . Three favorable , putative helix - stabilizing , i , i (cid:6) 4 intrachain ionic interactions ( Marqusee and Bald - win , 1987 ) can be assigned to cI - t , for example . As other 14 residue sites with three or even four positive i , i (cid:6) 4 attractive ion pairs exist within Ir , the coiled - coil trigger sequence is not different from other two - heptad repeat segments in terms of intrahelical electrostatic interactions . Although the peptide’s pH titration curve is difﬁcult to interpret due to the presence of several charged residues , 1889 a rough estimation suggests that protonation of lysine residues ( p K a (cid:7) 10 . 8 ) is the main cause of the pH - dependent helix - stabilizing effect in cI - t ( Figure 5B ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings are consistent with cI - t representing an autonomous helical folding unit ( Shoemaker et al . , 1987 ; Scholtz and Baldwin , 1992 ) . Towards dissecting the mechanistic details of coiled - coil formation For productive oligomer formation of coiled coils to occur , it is reasonable to assume that some partial folding of the monomer species may be required . Recent measurements of the kinetics of helix unfolding , both in a peptide ( Williams et al . , 1996 ) and in a protein ( Gilmanshin et al . , 1997 ) , have indicated that helix unfolding and refolding occur on a time scale of 10 – 7 s or faster . Because helix nucleation is ten times faster than the fastest loop closure reaction ( Eaton et al . , 1997 ) , it follows that incipient helices are already present when formation of the tertiary structure begins . As the monomeric peptide cI - t revealed signiﬁcant helicity in aqueous solution , we may speculate that the process of chain assembly in native cortexillin I is controlled by helix formation at the coiled - coil trigger site Arg311 – Asp324 . One feature of the trigger site which might be important in this context is the presence of a putative interhelical , g to e (cid:5) , attractive ionic interaction between Arg317 of one chain and Glu322 of the other ( i . e . between residue i and residue i (cid:5)(cid:6) 5 ; O’Shea et al . , 1991 ) . This interaction may be important in the chain – chain recognition and in - register alignment process at some stage in the folding pathway . From the interacting trigger sites , helices then propagate along the molecule to form ﬁnally a stable two - stranded coiled coil . Clearly , the heptad repeats involved in the elongation process are important for the overall stability and stoichiometry of the ﬁnal structure . Such a mechanism might explain the fast folding rates observed for two - stranded coiled coils of varying length ( Mo et al . , 1991 , 1992 ; Wendt et al . , 1995 ; Zitzewitz et al . , 1995 ; 1997 ; Sosnick et al . , 1996 ) . It should be noted , however , that the ability of a chain segment to fold into a stable monomer helix is probably not sufﬁcient to mediate proper coiled - coil formation . The CD spectrum of Ir - 6hC , for example , was characteristic for 50 – 60 % helix formation . However , the fragment was clearly monomeric , as revealed by AUC and by its concentration - independent CD signal at 222 nm . More - over , Ir - 6hC exhibited a broad non - cooperative thermal unfolding CD proﬁle . The possibility that Ir - 6hC forms an antiparallel coiled coil in which the monomeric chain folds back on itself therefore cannot be completely ruled out . Coiled - coil regions of different stabilities , in turn , may be important for regulatory or mechanical processes as has recently been proposed by Tripet et al . ( 1997 ) . Interestingly , these authors found that conserved ‘non - ideal’ residues located within hydrophobic positions of the two central heptad repeats of the kinesin neck destabil - ize the two - stranded , parallel coiled coil . Based on this ﬁnding , Tripet et al . ( 1997 ) concluded that these non - ideal residues may enable a portion of the coiled coil to unwind cooperatively during kinesin motility . Clearly , kinetic folding and unfolding measurements of wild - type and mutant Ir molecules and fragments thereof M . O . Steinmetz et al . will now be necessary to elucidate more rigorously the exact role of the coiled - coil trigger site . Materials and methods Construction of expression plasmids cDNA of full - length D . discoideum cortexillin I ( Faix et al . , 1996 ) was used as a template for PCR ampliﬁcation of DNA fragments encoding residues 227 – 352 ( Ir ) , 227 – 338 ( Ir - 2hC ) , 227 – 331 ( Ir - 3hC ) , 227 – 324 ( Ir - 4hC ) , 227 – 317 ( Ir - 5hC ) , 227 – 310 ( Ir - 6hC ) , 227 – 268 ( Ir - 12hC ) , 311 – 352 ( Ir - 12hN ) , 269 – 352 ( Ir - 6hN ) , 1 – 310 ( cI – 310 ) and 1 – 324 ( cI – 324 ) . For Ir , oligonucleotides were designed to obtain a Nde I site at the 5 (cid:5) end ( CCTCCCATATGGCCTATAGAGCCAAGGAAGAG ) and two translation stop signals TAA followed by a Bam HI site at the 3 (cid:5) end ( CCCGGATCCTTATTATCTGATTCTGGTGGCTTCGAT ) . For the Ir fragments , primers were designed to obtain either a Nde I ( Ir - 2hC , Ir - 3hC , Ir - 4hC and Ir - 5hC : same 5 (cid:5) primer as for Ir ) or a Bam HI site at the 5 (cid:5) end ( Ir - 6hC and Ir - 12hC , CCCGGATCCGCCTATAGAGCCAA - GGAAGAG ; Ir - 12hN , CCCGGATCCCGTATGGAACTCGAAGCAAG ; and Ir - 6hN , CCCGGATCCAAGGATCAACTCAATAGTTTATTG ) and two TAA stop codons preceding a Bam HI site ( Ir - 2hC , CCCGGATCCTT - ATTATTCATCGATGGCTTCAGCTAAT ; Ir - 3hC , CCCGGATCCTTA - TTATTTCAATTCCAAGATAGCTCTATC ; Ir - 4hC , CCCGGATCCTT - ATTAATCCTTTTCGGTCTTGGCTAAT ; Ir - 5hC , CCCGGATCCTTAT - TATCTTGCTTCGAGTTCCATACG ; Ir - 6hC , CCCGGATCCTTATTAA - GCCAATTTCTCTAATTCCAA ; Ir - 12hC , CCCGGATCCTTATTATTG - TTTGATTAATTGTTCACGTG ; Ir - 12hN and Ir - 6hN , same 3 (cid:5) primer as for Ir ) at the 3 (cid:5) end . Four cI - 310 and cI - 324 primers were designed to obtain a Bam HI site preceding an FXa cleavage site at the 5 (cid:5) end ( CGCGGATCCCAATCGAAGGTCGTATGGCAGGTAAAGATTGGG - AAATA ) and a TAA stop codon followed by a Hin dIII site ( cI - 310 , CCCAAGCTTTTAAGCCAATTTCTCTAATTCCAA ; cI - 324 , CCCAA - GCTTTTAATCCTTTTCGGTCTTGGCTAA ) at the 3 (cid:5) end . The ampliﬁed products were ligated into the following bacterial expression vectors : pET – 15b ( Novagen ) at Nde I – Bam HI sites ( Ir , Ir - 2hC , Ir - 3hC , Ir - 4hC and Ir - 5hC ) ; pPEP – T ( Brandenberger et al . , 1996 ) at Bam HI – Bam HI sites ( Ir - 6hC , Ir - 12hC , Ir - 12hN and Ir - 6hN ) ; and pQE – 32 ( Qiagen ) at Bam HI – Hin dIII restriction sites ( cI - 310 and cI - 324 ) . The inserted sequences of all constructs were veriﬁed by Sanger dideoxy DNA sequencing . Production and puriﬁcation of recombinant cortexillin I fragments The E . coli host strains JM109 ( DE3 ) ( Promega ) for pPEP – T and pET – 15b and M13 ( Qiagen ) for pQE – 32 - expression plasmids were used for expression . Production and afﬁnity puriﬁcation of His 6 - tagged fusion proteins by immobilized metal afﬁnity chromatography ( IMAC ) on Ni 2 (cid:6) - Sepharose ( Novagen ) was performed under denaturing ( all Ir fragments ) or non - denaturing ( cI - 310 and cI - 324 ) conditions as described in the manufacturer’s instructions . Separation of recombinant fragments from the His 6 - tag or from the His 6 - tagged carrier protein by thrombin cleavage was carried out as described by Kammerer et al . ( 1995 ) . FXa ( Boehringer Mannheim ) cleavage was performed at 10°C for 72 h in 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 at an enzyme : substrate stoichiometry of 1 : 2000 . Polypeptide chain fragments obtained from pPEP – T and pET – 15b contained two additional GlySer residues or four GlySerHisMet residues , respectively , at their N - termini which are not part of the cortexillin I sequence . The homogeneity of the recombinant cortexillin I fragments was tested by SDS – PAGE or tricine - SDS – PAGE according to Scha¨gger and von Jagow ( 1987 ) . Concentrations of the puriﬁed proteins were determined by the BCA protein assay ( Pierce ) . If not stated otherwise , all protein samples were dialyzed against 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , supplemented with 150 mM NaCl and stored at either 4°C or – 70°C for further analysis . Peptide The 16 residue peptide cI - t ( Ac - ARMELEARLAKTEKDR - NH 2 ) was purchased from MedProbe ( Norway ) . Purity of the peptide , which was (cid:3) 95 % , had been checked by qualitative amino acid and mass spectral analysis . Exact concentrations of peptide solutions were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis . Analytical ultracentrifugation ( AUC ) AUC was performed according to Faix et al . ( 1996 ) . Unless stated otherwise , the recombinant cortexillin I rod fragments were analyzed at 1890 20°C in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with 150 mM NaCl , and protein concentrations were adjusted to 0 . 1 – 0 . 5mg / ml .

Electron microscopy ( EM ) Sample preparation for EM was performed as described by Engel ( 1994 ) . The glycerol - sprayed / rotary metal - shadowed specimens ( 10 – 50 μ g / ml ) were examined in a Philips EM400 TEM operated at 80 kV . Electron micrographs were recorded on Kodak SO - 163 electron image ﬁlm at 40 000 times nominal magniﬁcation , which was calibrated according to Wrigley ( 1968 ) . Molecular length distributions of Ir were measured from micrograph areas enlarged ten times , plotted as histograms and ﬁtted by single Gaussian curves using a Marquaradt curve ﬁtting software ( Sigma Plot , Jandel Scientiﬁc ) . Circular dichroism ( CD ) spectroscopy Far - UV CD spectra and thermal unfolding proﬁles were recorded on a Cary 61 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature - controlled quartz cell of 0 . 1 cm pathlength as described by Kammerer et al . ( 1995 ) . A ramping rate of 1°C / min was used for all experiments . CD analysis of the peptide cI - t was carried out on a Jasco J 720 spectro - polarimeter equipped with a temperature - controlled quartz cell of 0 . 5 cm pathlength . Spectra represent averages of ten accumulations . Data were evaluated with the Jasco J 720 ( Japan Scientiﬁc ) and Sigma Plot ( Jandel Scientiﬁc ) software . 1 - anilino - 8 - naphthalenesulfonate ( ANS ) binding studies Fluorescence studies of binding to ANS were performed as described in Jelesarov and Bosshard ( 1996 ) in a Jasco FP - 777 spectroﬂuorimeter by measuring the change in ﬂuorescence emission between 400 and 600 nm ( excitation 350 nm ) .
