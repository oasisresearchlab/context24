Yet how proliferation is regulated in the tissue context remains poorly understood . Here , we introduce a quantitative framework to elucidate how tissue growth dynamics regulate cell proliferation . We show that tissue growth causes confinement that suppresses cell growth ; however , this confinement does not directly affect the cell cycle . This leads to uncoupling between rates of cell growth and division in epithelia and , thereby , reduces cell size . Division becomes arrested at a minimal cell size , which is consistent across diverse epithelia in vivo . Here , the nucleus approaches a volume limit set by the compacted genome . The loss of Cyclin D1 - dependent cell size regulation results in an abnormally high nuclear - to - cytoplasmic volume ratio and DNA damage . Overall , we demonstrate how epithelial proliferation is regulated by the interplay between tissue confinement and cell size regulation . Highlights - In epithelia , regulation of cell growth and cycle are uncoupled - Cell growth is regulated by tissue - scale dynamics , which determine confinement - Cell volume in epithelial tissue is described by G1 sizer model with a tunable growth rate - Volume of cells in epithelial tissues is near a minimum set by genome size Keywords : contact inhibition of proliferation ; cell cycle ; cell growth ; epithelium ; 2 INTRODUCTION Regulation of cell proliferation is a central question for understanding tissue development , growth and homeostasis ( Murray and Hunt , 1993 ; Nurse , 2000 ) . In contrast to the exponential proliferation of isolated cells ( Broach , 2012 ; Scott and Hwa , 2011 ) , multicellular tissue requires tight coupling between cell proliferation and tissue growth ( Irvine and Shraiman , 2017 ) . One proposed mechanism for regulating proliferation in epithelia is the so - called process of “contact inhibition of proliferation” ( henceforth referred to as contact inhibition ) where cell proliferation becomes highly restricted due to spatial constraints imposed by the tissue ( Irvine and Shraiman , 2017 ; McClatchey and Yap , 2012 ) . The disruption of contact inhibition results in cell overgrowth and altered tissue architecture ( Fomicheva and Macara , 2020 ; Kim et al . , 2011 ; Leontieva et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , contact inhibition is thought to play a key role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing tumor formation ( Irvine and Shraiman , 2017 ; Mendonsa et al . , 2018 ) . However , because contact inhibition is regulated through multiple signaling pathways and largely unknown parameters , we currently lack a framework for understanding the process across diverse tissues . This is evident from the literature where contact inhibition is described as dependent on cell density ( Ibar et al . , 2018 ) , adhesion signaling ( Kim et al . , 2011 ; McClatchey and Yap , 2012 ) and mechanical stress ( Irvine and Shraiman , 2017 ; Pan et al . , 2016 ) . As these variables are difficult to manipulate independently , it remains unclear how tissue geometry and growth dynamics impacts size and growth of constituent cells . The regulation of size and growth of isolated mammalian cells is , by contrast , well understood ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ; Tan et al . , 2021 ; Zatulovskiy et al . , 2020 ; Zatulovskiy and Skotheim , 2020 ) . Single cells go through cycles of coupled growth and division and have stable cell size due to feedback between cell growth and division . However , there appear to be different feedback mechanisms acting in different contexts . For example , single cells mainly sense the total amount of cell growth throughout the cell cycle to regulate the length of cell cycle phases ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ; Tan et al . , 2021 ) . In contrast , mouse epidermal tissue shows feedback via a cell size checkpoint preventing small cells from entering S phase ( Xie and Skotheim , 2020 ) . Due to limited data in vivo it remains unclear if this is a consequence of tissue specific behavior in the skin or could reflect a difference in regulation between single cells and epithelial tissue . Several lines of evidence suggest the latter is true . For instance , the cell cycle duration can be on the scale of weeks or months in vivo ( Sender and Milo , 2021 ) , challenging established dilution - based mechanisms of cell cycle regulation ( Zatulovskiy et al . , 2020 ; Zatulovskiy and Skotheim , 2020 ) . Further , prior work has shown a possible switch to size - dependent regulation of the cell cycle in cell culture models of epithelial tissue ( Puliafito et al . , 2017 , 2012 ) . However , we lack a systematic study that explores how tissue - scale growth dynamics impact regulation of cell size and growth in epithelia . To understand how cell proliferation is regulated in epithelium , we first performed a meta - analysis of cell size data and found that epithelial cell sizes are remarkably consistent and highly context dependent . The cell size in epithelial tissue in vivo is always smaller than single cells in culture . However , we could recapitulate the in vivo cell size using a cell culture model of epithelial tissue formation , indicating that tissue - scale phenomena impact cell size regulation . To quantitatively explore this , we employed model epithelial tissues with varied growth rates . We then introduce a general framework to quantify how tissue - scale growth dynamics constrain cell growth , providing 3 a measure of “tissue confinement” . We show that increasing tissue confinement reduces cell growth and YAP / TAZ signaling but does not impact the cell cycle duration directly . Instead , cell cycle duration is regulated by cell size . There is a sharp cell cycle arrest at a cell volume of ~ 1000 µm 3 , consistent with cell size found in vivo . In both epithelial and single cell contexts , cell size regulation is well described by a “G1 sizer model” with a tunable growth rate . In epithelia cyclin D1 protein levels are strongly cell size - dependent and overexpression of cyclin D1 reduces the minimal cell size . This suggests that the levels of cyclin D1 controls size - dependent cell cycle arrest . We see that abnormally small cells display DNA damage as these cells approach a size limit set by the volume occupied by the fully compacted genome . This suggests that , in addition to mediating cell cycle arrest during contact inhibition , cell size regulation pathways are critical for maintaining epithelial homeostasis . Overall , we demonstrate the general mechanisms of cell growth and division regulation in epithelia which provides new insight into proliferative processes in tissue development , homeostasis , and disease . RESULTS Epithelial cell size is context dependent To screen for varied cell size regulation in epithelial tissue , we systematically compared cell volume from different tissues in vivo and cell culture models ( Table S1 ) . We compiled these data from available sources including histology sections from the human protein atlas ( Fig . 1A ) ( Uhlén et al . , 2015 ) , 3D segmentation data from Allen Cell Institute ( Fig . 1A ) ( 3D cell viewer - Allen Cell Explorer . ) and published cell volume measurements ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ; Elamin et al . , 2012 ; Engelberg et al . , 2011 ; Goldspink et al . , 2017 ; Guo et al . , 2017 ; Karve et al . , 2017 ; Leung et al . , 2014 ; Medeiros et al . , 2021 ; Morizane et al . , 2015 ; Padovan - Merhar et al . , 2015 ; Park et al . , 2010 ; Perez - Gonzalez et al . , 2019 ; Schutgens et al . , 2019 ; Viana et al . , 2021 ; Yao et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2008 ) . When cell volume measurements weren’t available , we estimated cell volume by identifying cells perpendicular to the tissue slice and then measuring their length and width . We confirmed that this provides an accurate estimation of volume from benchmarking against full 3D imaging ( Fig . S1 & S2 ) . Across 15 tissue types in the human protein atlas , we find the volume of epithelial cells is surprisingly consistent , with a narrow distribution of 630±180 μ m 3 ( Fig . 1B , circles ) . By comparison , the volume across 12 types of isolated epithelial or epithelial - like cells is consistently measured to be severalfold larger , with a volume of 2330±650 μ m 3 ( Fig . 1B , squares ) ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ; Guo et al . , 2017 ; Leung et al . , 2014 ; Park et al . , 2010 ; Perez - Gonzalez et al . , 2019 ; Viana et al . , 2021 ; Zhao et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , the volumes of epithelial cells cultured in 3D more closely matched those in vivo , with a mean of 1020±520 μ m 3 ( Fig . 1B , diamonds ) ( Elamin et al . , 2012 ; Engelberg et al . , 2011 ; Goldspink et al . , 2017 ; Karve et al . , 2017 ; Medeiros et al . , 2021 ; Morizane et al . , 2015 ; Schutgens et al . , 2019 ) . These data suggest that epithelial cell volume is strongly influenced by the tissue environment . To test this hypothesis , we utilized several different epithelial cell lines ( Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) , Caco - 2 and HaCaT ) to measure the cell volume in either subconfluent colonies ( SC ) or mature epithelium ( ME ) . Controlling cell plating density allowed for the formation of sub - confluent colonies each comprised of 50 - 1000 cells or a nearly confluent monolayer on collagen 4 gels ( see Methods ) . After the initial plating of monolayers , cell dynamics drive changes in their density , shape and speed over the next 1 - 2 days ( Devany et al . , 2021 ) ; we define a mature epithelium as the time at which these properties stop changing in time ( see Methods ) . Cell sizes were visualized with a fluorescently tagged membrane protein ( stargazin - gfp ( CACNG2 - gfp ) or stargazin - halotag ) ( Fig . 1C ) . To facilitate measurement of cell volume , cells were trypsinized , resuspended and then imaged ( Fig . 1C , Fig . S1 , see Methods ) . When in sub - confluent colonies , the cell volume of all three epithelial cell types is ~ 2800 μm 3 ( Fig . 1D , SC ) , consistent with the mean value of single cells in Fig . 1B ( Fig . 1D , dashed line ( ii ) ) . Further , we found that ME culture conditions reduced the cell volume by 60 % to plateau at ~ 1000 μm 3 ( Fig . S3 ) , a size consistent with in vivo data reported in Fig . 1B ( Fig . 1D , dashed line ( i ) , ) . We performed the same experiment on two cell lines which do not form coherent colonies , retinal pigment epithelial cells ( RPE - 1 ) and Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEF ) and did not see size reduction ( Fig . S4 ) . This suggests this context - dependency of cell size may be specific to epithelium . Together , these data suggest that contact inhibition qualitatively changes cell size regulation across diverse epithelia . Cell size reduction involves an uncoupling of growth and the cell cycle To query how cell growth and division rates change during the transition from subconfluent colonies to mature epithelium , live cell imaging was used to monitor changes in cell size and number . The data was aligned such that t = 0 h denotes the onset of confluence ( OC ) . For all earlier times , cells are in subconfluent colonies . By t > 12 h the cell movement has ceased , and density is constant ; we denote this as a mature epithelium ( Fig . 2A ) . We first consider cell division and growth rates for t < < 0 h ( SC ) , t ~ 0 h ( OC ) and t > > 0 h ( ME ) . Cell division rate , obtained by cell counting measurements , was completely arrested in the ME but only suppressed by ~ 40 % at OC , as compared to SC ( Fig . 2B , black bars ) . By contrast , the cell growth , obtained by quantifying the rate of protein dilution using pulse chase labeling ( see Methods ) , was suppressed almost entirely at OC ( Fig . 2B , purple bars ) . These data indicate suppression of cell growth and cycle are not tightly coupled during the transition from subconfluent to confluent tissue . Instead , cell growth is suppressed acutely at OC whereas cell cycle progression is only impacted in later stages ( Fig . 2C ) . In single cells , cell growth and division are coupled to maintain a constant size ( Zatulovskiy and Skotheim , 2020 ) . A division rate exceeding the growth rate would , instead , be expected to result in cell size reduction . To test this hypothesis , we measured the cell size between t = 0 and 18 h during the transition from OC to ME . Over this time , the cell height remained constant , such that changes in cell area were accurate indicators of cell volume ( Fig . S2C ) . The average cell area from a population of ~ 1000 cells decreases by ~ 50 % from OC ( t = 0 h ) to ME ( Fig . 2D ) . To determine the mechanism driving changes in cell volume we performed single cell tracking . Cells that divided near the beginning of the experiment ( t = 0 h ) were identified and tracked through the experiment . Individual cell trajectories revealed that the cell size reduction occurred by successive cell division events in the absence of cell growth ( Fig . 2E , F ) . Indeed , across a large population of mother - daughter cell pairs , the cell size of a daughter cell 8 hr ( ~ 1 / 2 cell cycle time , τ ) post cell division remained approximately half that of the mother cell size ( Fig . 2G ) . This indicates minimal cell growth during the cell cycle . This is in stark contrast with subconfluent cells , where a cell grows at a constant 5 rate and doubles in size prior to division into two daughter cells ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ) . For single cells , we would expect the cell to grow by ~ 50 % at 8 hours post division , resulting in a slope of ~ 3 / 4 ( Fig . 2G , dashed line ) . To demonstrate that cell division is necessary for cell size to decrease , experiments similar to those in Fig . 2A were performed with a Tet - On p27 MDCK cell line to artificially arrest the cell cycle in the presence of doxycycline ( Sherr and Roberts , 1999 ) . In the absence of dox ( - dox ) , the volume decreases in ME compared to SC , similar to our previous experiments ( Fig . 2H , I ) . Addition of doxycycline at OC prevented cell volume decrease in ME ( ME + dox p27 ) , and the volume of these cells remained similar to that of SC ( Fig . 2H , I ) . Induction of a mutant p27 which does not arrest the cell cycle ( + dox p27ck ) ( Vlach , 1997 ) had no effect on cell size in ME ( Fig . 2I ) . Together , these data demonstrate that temporal uncoupling of cell growth and cell cycle result the cell size reduction during formation of mature epithelial tissue . At the onset of confluence , cell growth is highly suppressed and cell volume reduces by division in absence of cell growth ( Fig 2J ) . Then at later times the cell cycle also becomes arrested , and cells reach a final cell size which is comparable to epithelium in vivo . We next sought to understand regulation of cell growth and cycle in the epithelium . Tissue confinement regulates cell growth These data motivate the need to introduce a quantitative framework to relate the tissue and cell growth rates . We first consider the growth of a multi - cellular tissue with initial area 𝐴 0 and time - dependent area , 𝐴 ( 𝑡 ) . Then , consider this tissue broken up into individual cells to represent the proliferation dynamics of this tissue in the absence of spatial constraints ( Fig . 3A ) . The collection of single cells grows in total size exponentially , such that the total time - dependent area is described by 𝐴 𝑈 ( 𝑡 ) ~ 2 𝑡 / 𝜏 , where τ is the average cell cycle time . The deviation of the tissue growth from this hypothetical maximum exponential rate quantifies the constraints tissue growth places on cell growth . For a certain tissue area , A’ , if the ratio of the tissue growth rate to the unconfined growth rate : 𝑑𝐴𝑑𝑡 | 𝐴′ 𝑑𝐴𝑈𝑑𝑡 | 𝐴′ is less than 1 , then the tissue growth dynamics constrain cell proliferation . We then define the tissue confinement 𝐶 ( 𝐴 ′ ) = 1 − 𝑑𝐴 𝑑𝑡 | 𝐴′ 𝑑𝐴𝑈𝑑𝑡 | 𝐴′ such that there is no confinement effect ( C = 0 ) when single cells and tissues have identical growth dynamics and C = 1 when tissue growth rate is zero . We explored this framework using model tissues comprised of large , circular colonies of MDCK cells , chosen for their well - characterized growth dynamics and the facility of controlling their size ( Heinrich et al . , 2020 ; Puliafito et al . , 2012 ) . Circular colonies of variable size A 0 from ~ 1 - 7 mm 2 were formed by seeding the cells in a Polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) stencil atop a glass coverslip ( Fig . 3B & C ) . The stencil was then released to allow for colony expansion for Δt = 48 hours ( Fig . 3D ) . Importantly , the colony expansion is determined by radial migration speed 𝑣 of cells at the periphery to increase the colony radius by 𝑣∆𝑡 ( Fig . 3B , arrow ) . Consistent with previous studies , the radial expansion rate was independent of colony size ( Fig . 3D , Fig . S5 ) . This results in a growth rate that scales quadratically with colony area ( see Methods ) . For a given colony area , variation in 𝑣 provides additional control over colony growth rate ( Fig . 3E ) . Under control conditions , 𝑣 varied 6 between experiments from 15 - 30 μm / hr ( Fig . S5 ) . This tissue growth rate was not impacted when inhibiting cell division but was reduced by inhibiting cell migration by a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor ( FAKi ) ( Fig . S5 ) . Thus , variations in both the initial colony size and expansion velocity provide a wide range of tissue growth rates . We generated model curves of the expected colony growth rates for the ranges of areas and edge velocities observed experimentally ( Fig . 3F , solid lines ) . These rates were then compared to that expected for exponential growth of single cells , using the experimentally measured doubling time of 15 h ( Fig . 3F , dashed line ) . For small areas , exponential growth is smaller than the growth rate of the expanding colony ( Fig . 3F ) ; here tissue - scale growth dynamics do not constrain cell proliferation . This is the behavior for SC . By contrast , for large areas , expanding colony growth rates become substantially lower than the exponential growth of single cells ( e . g . Fig . 3F , gray shaded region ) . Here , tissue growth dynamics constrain cell proliferation . The colony area when exponential growth and quadratic growth rates are equal demarks the transition between these two regimes and , here , 𝐶 = 0 ( Fig . 3F , black X ) . For each given growth model , the confinement 𝐶 is plotted as a function of colony area ( Fig . 3G , lines ) . Confinement was determined from experimental data with varying 𝐴 0 and 𝑣 ( Fig . 3G , points ) . These experimental conditions then provide a means to systematically explore cell behavior in varied 𝐶 from < 0 . 25 to ~ 0 . 8 . Thus , our tissue confinement framework provides a quantitative method to assess how tissue - scale growth dynamics are expected to constrain growth of single cells . To test the utility of this framework , we explored cell growth and signaling in tissues with varied levels of confinement . To query cell growth , we labeled the cells at t = 0 with CellTrace , a fluorescent dye which reports on biomass production by its dilution ( i . e . more growth leads to lower cell intensity ) ( see Methods ) . The total growth is determined from the CellTrace images by the ratio of intensity 𝐼 ( 𝑡 = 0 ) 𝐼 ( 𝑡 = ∆𝑡 ) − 1 = 𝑉𝑜𝑙 ( 𝑡 = ∆𝑡 ) 𝑉𝑜𝑙 ( 𝑡 = 0 ) − 1 = ∆𝑉𝑜𝑙 . Since the growth rate of confluent monolayers is close to zero ( Fig . 2B ) , the intensity of the confluent monolayer 𝐼 𝐶 ~ 𝐼 ( 𝑡 = 0 ) , can be used as the standard to compare to the intensity 𝐼 of expanding colonies ( Fig . 4A , C = 1 ) . This allows for determination of the growth rate by 𝐼 𝐶 / 𝐼 − 1 . For ∆𝑡 = 48 hours , subconflucent cells show significant 10 - fold CellTrace dilution consistent with the cells doubling every 15h ( Fig . 4A , C = 0 ) . We then used expanding colonies with varied 𝐴 0 to explore intermediate levels of confinement from 0 . 2 to 0 . 8 . In smaller colonies with C = 0 . 2 , cell growth is already suppressed to < 50 % that of sub - confluent conditions . By C = 0 . 6 , growth is restricted to < 10 % that of the subconfluent cells and is suppressed to nearly zero by C = 0 . 8 ( Fig . 4A ) . Changes in growth can also be modulated by changing the edge velocity . In our experiments , we observed that differences in migration rate significantly impact the cell growth , as predicted by our modeling ( Fig . 4C ) . In all conditions , the intensity is remarkably uniform across the tissue suggesting that the growth regulation mechanism is a tissue - scale phenomenon . To query cell growth signaling under confinement , we also performed immunostaining against YAP . YAP is a transcription factor implicated in regulating cell proliferation during contact inhibition ( Aragona et al . , 2013 ; McClatchey and Yap , 2012 ; Zheng and Pan , 2019 ) . When YAP is active , it is localized to the nucleus ; when inactive , YAP is localized to the cytoplasm . We see 7 in the conditions with lower confinement , a greater faction of YAP is localized to the nucleus , whereas around C = 0 . 5 it becomes more localized to the cytoplasm ( Fig . 4B ) . This suggests that YAP activity is regulated in response to changes in tissue confinement ( Fig . 4B ) . Taking together , all our experimental data from colonies with varying size and edge velocity ( Fig . 3G ) reveal a systematic decrease in cell growth and YAP signaling as a function of confinement ( Fig . 4D , points ) . Moreover , the predicted growth from the definition of tissue confinement is consistent with the experimental data ( Fig . 4D , line ) . All of these data demonstrate the rapid suppression of cell growth at low levels of confinement . At the onset of confluence , the cell division rate remains similar to subconfluent cells despite the increased confinement ( Fig . 2B ) ; this suggests that tissue confinement may not immediately affect the cell cycle . To query the cell cycle , we performed the expanding colony experiments with MDCK cells expressing the pip - degron fluorescent ubiquitination cell cycle indicator ( FUCCI MDCK ) ( Grant et al . , 2018 ) to measure the fraction of cells in S / G2 / M in model tissues with varying levels of confinement . We restrict our analysis to short expansion times ( ∆𝑡 = 12 h ) before cells have reached the ME state and arrested the cell cycle . In contrast to cell growth ( Fig . 4F , peach data ) , there cell cycle is insensitive to tissue confinement ( Fig . 4F , red ) . Instead , the fraction of cells in S / G2 / M is constant ( Fig . 4F , dashed line ) . This data reveals the qualitatively different impact of confinement on cell cycle and growth . Thus , the transient uncoupling between cell cycle and growth observed in Fig . 2B is consistent with a rapid increase in confinement at the onset of confluence . A G1 sizer arrests the cell cycle in confined epithelium We next explored how the cell cycle arrests in monolayers at the later stages of contact inhibition . After confinement reduces the growth rate , cell size decreases through successive cell division until the cell cycle becomes arrested ( Fig . 2J ) . Previous work has shown that cell cycle regulation in isolated mammalian cells is cell size independent ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ) whereas it can be size - dependent for in in vivo epithelium ( Xie and Skotheim , 2020 ) . To examine if cell division is regulated by cell size in our data , we measured how the cell division rate varied as a function of cell size by tracking individual division events . We estimate volumes from the cell area multiplied by the typical cell height of 6 . 5±1 . 5  m ( Fig . S2 , mean±S . D . ) . Above a volume of 1200 μm 3 , the cell division rate is independent of size ( Fig . 5A ) . However , the division rate sharply decreases for smaller volumes . This trend is observed across a range of experimental conditions and two epithelial cell types , indicating it is a robust feature of cell size regulation in confluent epithelial tissue ( Fig . S6 ) . We then used FUCCI MDCK cells to look more closely at the cell cycle regulation for large and small cells . From the FUCCI data , we obtained the S / G2 / M duration by tracking single cell trajectories and saw that the duration of the S / G2 / M phases is ≈10 hours and independent of cell size ( Fig . 5B ) . In the same data , the duration of the entire cell cycle was estimated by measuring the fraction of cells in each cell cycle phase ( see Methods ) . We see that the cell cycle duration rapidly increases for smaller cells ( Fig . 5B , purple data ) . The division rate in Fig . 5A can also be used to estimate cell cycle duration and shows a similar trend ( Fig . 5B , dashed line ) . Together , these data indicate an increased duration of the G1 phase for smaller cells . This is consistent with previous results that size regulation occurs at the G1 - S transition ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ; Murray and Hunt , 1993 ; Xie and Skotheim , 2020 ) . 8 Motivated by this data , we developed a simple “G1 sizer” model of size - dependent exit from G1 ( Fig . 5C ) ( Heldt et al . , 2018 ; Xie and Skotheim , 2020 ) . In the model , we simulate an ensemble of cells that grow at a constant rate , have two cell cycle phases G1 and S / G2 / M , and divide into two daughter cells with half the mother volume . We added additional features based on experimental observations : ( 1 ) There is a sharp volume threshold of the G1 - S transition rate and below this minimal size 𝑎 , the transition rate is zero , ( 2 ) cells have an S / G2 / M duration of 𝜏 = 10 hours independent of cell volume , and ( 3 ) a variable cell growth rate G that is normalized to vary from 0 for no growth to 1 for growth in the unconfined condition . Due to rule ( 2 ) the minimum cell cycle time is 𝜏 hours and cells will grow by a minimum of 𝐺𝜏 before each division . When 𝐺𝜏 ≫ 𝑎 , cells are large compared to 𝑎 and the G1 - S transition proceeds quickly . In this regime , the cell cycle regulation is size independent ( timer - like ) with a time 𝜏 between cell divisions ( Fig . 5D , G = 1 , Fig . S7 ) . However , when the growth rate is suppressed such that 𝐺𝜏 < < 𝑎 , additional time is required to relieve the size constraint of the G1 - S transition ( 1 ) ( Fig . 5D , G = 0 . 05 , Fig . S7 ) . In this regime , the cell cycle regulation is highly size - dependent ( sizer - like ) . Plotting the cell size at division as a function of cell size at birth for a range of growth rates shows that the model transitions smoothly from size - dependent to size - independent behavior as a function of growth rate ( Fig . 5E , Fig . S8 ) . Size - dependent cells divide at the same size and show no correlation between birth size and division size ( Fig . 5E , dashed lines for G = 0 . 05 , 0 . 2 ) . This contrasts with size independent cells which show a correlation between birth size and division size ( Fig . 5E , dashed lines for G = 0 . 7 & 1 ) ( Amir , 2014 ; Cadart et al . , 2018 ; Xie and Skotheim , 2020 ; Zatulovskiy and Skotheim , 2020 ) . These different regulation mechanisms also occur in distinct cell size ranges consistent with previous work showing that large , rapidly growing , single cells are size independent ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ) and small , slowly growing cells , in vivo are size - dependent ( Xie and Skotheim , 2020 ) . Having developed an understanding of the model at constant or near - constant growth rates , we tested if the model could also predict the cell size distributions found in the experiments of monolayer formation and maturation in Fig . 2B . We simulate monolayer formation in our model by a rapid quench of cell growth rate from 1 to 0 at t = 0 and measure the cell size distribution over time ( Fig . 5F ) . The simulation results ( Fig . 5F , black ) are consistent with those of the experiment ( Fig . 5F , peach ) . This suggests that the G1 sizer model together with an understanding of how confinement impacts cell growth ( Fig . 4F ) is sufficient to explain transitions in size of isolated cells to those in epithelial tissue . S ize - dependent Cyclin D degradation leads to cell cycle arrest To investigate molecular mechanisms of size control , we took advantage of our Tet - inducible cell lines to manipulate cell size in confluent monolayers . We prepared monolayers at the onset of confluence with Tet - On p27 and Tet - On p27ck cells . At t = 0 we added doxycycline ( + dox ) to induce expression . After 5 days , both monolayers are in a cell cycle and growth arrested ME state , but the + dox p27ck cells are 40 % the size of + dox p27 cells ( Fig . 2I ; Fig . 6A ) . RNA sequencing revealed almost no differences in the steady - state transcriptome of these samples ( Fig . 6B ) . However , close examination revealed several weak signatures ( Fig . S9 ) including a slight downregulation of cyclin D1 , 2 , 3 in the smaller contact inhibited cells ( Fig . 6B , inset ) . The G1 / S 9 transition has a steep dependence on cyclin D concentration ( Fan and Meyer , 2021 ) so it is possible that small changes in cyclin D concentration are sufficient to arrest the cell cycle . Furthermore , cyclin D is strongly post transcriptionally regulated by degradation ( Alao , 2007 ) . To check if this difference in RNA abundance leads to changes in protein levels , we looked at cyclin D1 ( cyD1 ) protein levels via immunofluorescence in ME formed with Tet - On p27 cells ( + dox p27 ) and co - cultures including Tet - On p27ck cells ( + dox p27 / p27ck ) . Since p27 is known to interact with cyclin D , we tested that its overexpression did not change the cyclin D1 levels by inducing p27 after ME formation ( Delay + dox p27 ) . Interestingly , we found significant difference in cyclin D1 abundance , with nearly undetectable levels in cells with a nuclear area < 100  m 2 ( Fig . 6 C ; Fig . S10 ) . We observed that the intensity of CyD1 drops rapidly with decreasing cell size , measured by the nuclear area ( Fig . 6D ) . The same trend was seen for all monolayer preparations , suggesting that the cyclin D1 level is regulated by a size - dependent pathway . This suggests that in addition to transcriptional changes in cyclin D , additional size - dependent post transcriptional regulation occurs , possibly as reported in other contexts ( Alao , 2007 ; Masamha and Benbrook , 2009 ) . To test if decreased cyclin D levels are required to arrest the cell cycle , we overexpressed cyclin D1 in contact inhibited cells . We used Tet - On Cyclin D1 - GFP ( CyD ) or Tet - On Cyclin D1 T286A T288A - GFP ( CyDAA , a degradation resistant mutant ) cells and induced the expression of additional cyclin D1 at OC . We then looked at the cell size 3 days later , after it had reached a plateau . We observe that overexpression of either CyD or CyDAA leads to decrease in minimal cell size in ME , compared to control ( - dox ) ( Fig . 6E , F ) . Therefore , restoring Cyclin D1 in small cells is sufficient to initiate the cell cycle . This suggests that the depletion of cyclin D is necessary for size - dependent arrest of the cell cycle . We also overexpressed the viral oncoprotein E1a which is known to bind and inactivate Rb pocket proteins and activate the G1 / S transition ( Whyte et al . , 1989 ) . Cells that overexpressed E1a also showed decreased size , suggesting that cyclin D depletion arrests the cell cycle by inhibiting the G1 / S transition ( Fig . 6F ) . Cell cycle arrest occurs near cell size minimum set by the genome size We next wanted to understand why the cell cycle normally arrests at a volume of ~ 1000  m 3 . A possible constraint on cell size comes from the volume occupied by the genome . As the cell size decreases , the nucleus gets smaller and chromatin gets more compact ( Viana et al . , 2021 ) . A simple estimate suggests low chromatin concentrations ~ 5 % by volume in an average subconfluent mammalian cell ( Vol nuc ~ 1 / 3Vol cell ~ 800um 3 vs Vol genome ~ 40um 3 ) ( Milo and Phillips , 2015 ) . However , the concentration would increase several fold as cell size reduces and the total chromatin per cell remains constant . Previous measurements of chromosome size by TEM and AFM have shown that the volume of a full set of chromosomes are approximately 50 - 100  m 3 ( Fritzsche and Henderson , 1996 ; Heslop - Harrison et al . , 1989 ) and 50 % chromatin by volume ( Ou et al . , 2017 ) , thus , setting a lower limit on cell size . When we stained both the DNA and cell membrane , we observed that the abnormally small Tet - On CyDAA cells appear to have an unusually large nucleus relative to the cell size ( Fig . 7A ) . This was surprising given that there is typically a tight scaling relationship between cell size and nuclear size ( Viana et al . , 2021 ) . Comparing the cell volume against the nuclear volume for epithelium prepared under our previously described conditions , we observe this scaling relationship except in the Tet - On CyDAA cells in the presence of doxycycline ( Fig . 7B , peach ) . Instead , we observe that the ratio of nuclear to cell size is rapidly increasing as 10 cell size decreases below 1000  m 3 ( Fig . 7C ) and approaches the regions where DNA compaction exceeds the chromosomal values or where nuclear size would exceed cell size ( Fig . 7B , gray , Fig . 7C gray ) . We hypothesized that increasing chromatin concentration could disrupt normal chromatin function , leading to DNA damage . In abnormally small cells we observed phospho - H2A . X foci indicating locations of DNA damage ( Fig . 7D , E ) . This suggests that normal cells arrest near a cell size minimum but outside the range where DNA damage occurs frequently . DNA damage is known to arrest the cell cycle through Rb / Cyclin D independent mechanisms ( Shaltiel et al . , 2015 ) preventing further size reduction . Therefore , in epithelia , proliferative homeostasis is maintained by an interplay between cell growth in proportion to tissue constraints and cell size - dependent G1 / S regulation which arrests cell size near a minimum ( Fig . 7F ) . DISCUSSION While growth and division are coupled in single cells , we observe their regulation is uncoupled in epithelial tissue . The tissue growth dynamics regulate cell growth whereas cell division is regulated solely by cell size . Differences in these two rates drive changes in cell size depending on the tissue environment . In single cells , the environment places no constraint on cell growth leading to high growth rates and large cell size . In contrast , in mature epithelia , tissue growth rates are low and reduce cell size to a minimum . In this regime , cell size regulation is critical for maintaining cell homeostasis and preventing DNA damage . The consistency in cell size distributions across diverse epithelial cell types ( Fig . 1B ) suggest that our models should be broadly applicable to understand contact inhibition and cell size regulation across diverse biological systems . Canonically , growth factor signaling is thought to be the main pathway to control and coordinate proliferation ( Liang et al . , 2017 ; Schlessinger and Ullrich , 1992 ) . We identify an independent role for tissue confinement in controlling cell growth . While we exploited model tissues with a particular type of growth dynamics driven by edge migration , these ideas can be easily extended to arbitrary systems so long as the tissue growth dynamics can be readily characterized ( Fig . S11 ) . Tissue growth is driven by diverse processes , including migration , tissue buckling or mechanical stretch and occurs in response to cell turnover ( Cowin , 2004 ; Guillot and Lecuit , 2013 ) , all of which would reduce tissue confinement . Previous work has implied that cell growth and YAP / TAZ signaling in epithelium are regulated by mechanical stress ( Irvine and Shraiman , 2017 ; Pan et al . , 2016 ; Puliafito et al . , 2012 ; Shraiman , 2005 ; Streichan et al . , 2014 ) . Our framework provides a means to isolate the roles of physical constraints on cell growth regulation . Importantly , confinement is a geometric quantity readily determined from timelapse microscopy . Our data show that confinement is a strong predictor of YAP / TAZ activity , demonstrating the utility of our model to study the mechanisms underlying epithelial growth control . However , future work is needed to determine the relationships between tissue confinement , growth and mechano - transduction . Our observation of a transition between size - dependent and independent behaviors in epithelia may explain prior observations of size regulation in mammalian cells ( Cadart et al . , 2018 ; Xie et al . , 2022 ; Xie and Skotheim , 2020 ) . In our computational model we find that a size - dependent G1 / S transition gives rise to both sizer - like and timer - like behaviors of cell size regulation at low and high growth rates , respectively ( Fig . 5E ) . In future work , such a cell cycle model may be 11 extended to other cell types or non - mammalian systems which show uncoupling between growth and division like Chlamydomonas or cyanobacteria ( Li et al . , 2016 ; Liao and Rust , 2021 ) . Furthermore , the molecular mechanisms of G1 sizer regulation have remained elusive ( Xie et al . , 2022 ; Xie and Skotheim , 2020 ; Zhurinsky et al . , 2010 ) . By experimentally manipulating cell size , we showed that cyclin D1 regulation underlies G1 sizer behavior in epithelium . Cyclin D1 is strongly post transcriptionally regulated by degradation ( Alao , 2007 ) , suggesting that upstream kinase localization or activity may function in the size sensing pathway . Our observations may lead to future work to connect cyclin D1 regulation directly to cell size sensing . Finally , below the minimal size set by cyclin D1 regulation , significant DNA damage occurs suggesting an important role of size regulation in maintaining cell homeostasis . Cancers which are driven by mutations in genes implicated in cell size regulation , such as small cell cancer , may show similar DNA damage leading to additional mutations . Alongside recent work which shows that very large cells become nonfunctional ( Cheng et al . , 2021 ; Lanz et al . , 2021 ; Neurohr et al . , 2019 ) , the lower bound set by the genome size establishes a range of cell sizes for viable diploid mammalian cells from ~ 200 - 10000 µm 3 , similar to the range observed across different cell types ( Milo and Phillips , 2015 ) . Overall , our understanding of the proliferative behaviors in epithelium provides a new basis for studying development , homeostasis , and disease in complex epithelial tissues across diverse biological contexts .
