Scales and Jennifer A . Horney Epidemiology , University of Delaware , Newark , DE , United States From the start on the COVID - 19 pandemic , federal leadership on the implementation of control measures has been sporadic and inconsistent , with most decision - making dele - gated to state and local governmental public health agencies . While this type of delega - tion of authority to deliver public health services is typical in our decentralized public health system , as a result , the use of control measures has varied widely across different regions of the USA , with implications for health outcomes for their residents ( Box 3 . 1 ) . For example , states that implemented the fewest nonpharmaceutical interven - tions ( NPIs ) had a higher average number of cases per capita and higher hospitalization rates ( Leatherby & Harris , 2020 ) . The politicization of response d which has often been centered on resistance to NPIs like face coverings , closures , or social distancing d has also been highly problematic . Since May 2021 , U . S . counties won by Donald Trump in the 2020 election had death rates that were three times the death rates of counties won by Joe Biden ( Ngo , 2021 ; Wood & Brum ﬁ el , 2021 ) . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and other federal agencies have issued guidance for risk mitigation and disease control throughout the pandemic . Upon taking of ﬁ ce , the Biden Administration announced a National Strategy for the COVID - 19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness , which focused on restoring trust , mitigating spread , expanding emergency ﬁ nancial relief , safely reopening schools , busi - nesses , and travel , and vaccinating Americans ( White House , 2021 ) . However , following the widespread distribution of vaccines and expansion of age eligibility d ﬁ rst to anyone age 12 and older in May 2021 and subsequently to anyone 5 years of age or older in November 2021 d much of the focus on NPIs included in the National Strategy were abandoned in favor of a vaccine - centered strategy ( Raifman & Skinner , 2021 ) . For example , in May 2021 , the CDC eased its masking guidance for fully vaccinated people , with its director proclaiming that those who were fully vaccinated could “ participate in indoor and outdoor activities d large or small d without wearing a mask or physically distancing ” ( Miller & Balsamo , 2021 ) . More than 2 decades ago , a professor of psychology proposed a “ Swiss cheese model ” that could be used to avoid medical errors or mitigate their effects ( Reason , 2000 ) . Since the holes ( or vulnerabilities ) in any single slice of Swiss cheese would be unlikely to align The COVID - 19 Response ISBN 978 - 0 - 323 - 98810 - 0 , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / B978 - 0 - 323 - 98810 - 0 . 00009 - 0 © 2023 Elsevier Inc .

S . public health system is highly decentralized , with federal government agencies typi - cally providing funding , but delegating authority , to state and local public health agencies ( Wasserman et al . , 2006 ) . The organization of public health at the state level also varies widely . Some states have freestanding public health agencies , while others operate as part of a larger state - level health , human , or social - services agency . State public health agencies can be centralized or decentralized ( Table 3 . 1 ) . In centralized states , all public health workers are typi - cally state employees and decision making happens at the state level . In decentralized states , local health departments operate similar to the federal e state relationship ; local health depart - ments receive funding from the state but are delegated the authority to carry out their activ - ities based on local priorities . Several studies have determined that the public health system structure is a characteristic that is associated with public health preparedness and response . For example , centralized state health departments have less comprehensive pandemic in ﬂ uenza plans , perhaps because local authorities have reduced independence or autonomy to adapt their plans to local conditions ( Klaiman & Ibrahim , 2010 ) . Centralized health departments may also have less administrative capacity to rapidly receive additional funds during a public health emergency , slowing the hir - ing and purchasing needed during the response ( Horney et al . , 2017 ) . State public health struc - ture also played a role in the early adoption of NPIs , with one early study demonstrating that states with centralized public health governance were both slower to enact NPIs , and enacted fewer NPIs overall , compared with decentralized or locally controlled public health governance structures ( Strickland et al . , 2021 ) . Associations between public health structure and NPI timing are important to understand on order to maximize disease prevention and control . An analysis of the effect of NPIs such as school and work closures , stay - at - home orders , mobility restrictions , and event and gathering limits across 131 countries found that the maximum effect of NPIs lagged adoption of NPIs by 1 e 3 weeks ( Li , Campbell et al . , 2021 ) . Historically , there is also evidence that earlier implemen - tation of NPIs reduced mortality rates . During the 1918 in ﬂ uenza pandemic , cities that closed public spaces like schools , churches , and theaters and enforced quarantines and isolations had attenuated peak mortality rates ( Hatchett et al . , 2007 ) . Epidemiological studies from the 2009 novel In ﬂ uenza A ( H1N1 ) pandemic also showed notable reductions in in ﬂ uenza attack rates for workplaces that implemented social distancing guidelines ( Ahmed et al . , 2018 ) .

When applied to public health control measures , the “ slices ” would include various NPIs d distancing , face coverings , symptoms checkers , and schools closures d until pharmaceutical interventions could be developed ( Ngo , 2021 ) . Once available , vaccines could provide another layer of protection , but not the only one , since vaccine uptake was slow in some populations and access was inequitable in others . Balancing the incentives to be vaccinated ( e . g . , no longer needing to wear a mask ) with the populist push - back against mandates and the confusion amid frequent changes in guidance around the need to use NPIs proved a very dif ﬁ cult aspect of the public health response to the COVID - 19 pandemic . NPIs include , but are not limited to , handwashing and environmental sanitation , masking , closures , air ﬁ ltration , and voluntary isolation of cases and quarantine of close contacts . NPIs are frequently utilized as stop - gaps before pharmaceutical methods such as vaccines and other therapeutics are available ( Howard , 2021 ) . Understanding the tools available to public health authorities to support layers of protection against COVID - 19 remains important , both for ongoing efforts to control the course of the COVID - 19 pandemic and for integration into guidance for future pandemic preparedness . Quarantine , isolation , and contact tracing Quarantine and isolation are two fundamental tools used by public health of ﬁ cials for in - fectious disease control . The ﬁ rst recorded quarantine dates to 1377 in Dubrovnik , Croatia , where it was used as a means of separating sailors and their cargo from local pop - ulations until there was no longer a risk of them spreading plague ( Tognotti , 2013 ) . Quarantines have subsequently been put into place in response to threats from diseases ranging from typhus and typhoid , to in ﬂ uenza , severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , and Ebola ( Klibanoff , 2020 ) . While quarantine is intended to separate individ - uals who have been exposed to and potentially infected with a disease from others , isola - tion is intended to separate those known to be ill from others until they are no longer infectious ( CDC , 2017 ) . Voluntary selfquarantine has been promoted throughout the COVID - 19 pandemic as a means of reducing the risk that exposed , but not currently ill , individuals would trans - mit COVID - 19 to others in the community . Historically , as well as in response to the COVID - 19 pandemic , quarantines have been inequitably enforced , and had inequitable consequences , for different groups . During COVID - 19 , access to paid sick leave , remote work , and other workplace accommodations that support an individual ’ s ability to quar - antine when needed have been far more widely available to those with higher incomes . Half as many Black and Hispanic workers were able to work from home compared to White workers , and households with income at or above the median were twice as likely to be able to switch to remote work compared with those with household incomes Implementing public health control measures 37 less than $ 25 , 000 ( Gwynn , 2021 ; U . S . Census Bureau , 2021 ) . With the introduction of vaccines , guidelines for selfquarantine have changed , with no quarantine periods required following exposures for those who are considered up to date on vaccination ( CDC , 2022a ) . Although these changes are in part designed to encourage vaccination , differential access to , and trust in , vaccines could deepen inequities that result from short - ening quarantine times for those who are vaccinated and have received a booster dose . The isolation of contagious individuals clearly reduces contact rates and breaks transmis - sion chains . Countries like South Korea that implemented strict isolation protocols supported by technologies such as location data , credit card transactions , and closed - circuit television were largely able to limit community transmission , at least early in the pandemic ( Kang et al . , 2021 ) . In addition to a reliance on technologies , the countries that were most success - ful in their implementation of isolation and quarantine were also able to rely on lessons learned from their response to the 2003 SARS outbreak . Many also provided comprehen - sive supports , including ﬁ nancial payments , food assistance , and alternative accommodations , to support people required to isolate ( Patel et al . , 2021 ) . However , isolation d speci ﬁ cally as a public health control measure and more generally as a result of the use of other NPIs d led to striking increases in the prevalence of negative mental health sequelae . An additional challenge to the effectiveness of isolation during the COVID - 19 pandemic was the proportion of transmission that occured prior to symptom onset , which was un - known early in the pandemic . As more data became available , it appeared that the majority of spread was between 2 days prior to symptoms and 5 days after symptoms , at least among those who were vaccinated ( Kissler et al . , 2021 ) . Based on these data , and also in part due to economic pressures and workforce shortages during the Omicron surge , isolation periods were shortened over the course of the pandemic , with recommended isolation periods being reduced to 5 days in late December 2021 . Similar to reductions of quarantine periods , or even elimination of quarantine requirements among the fully vaccinated , these changes to isolation requirements were likely at least partially intended to encourage vaccination . Many felt that given the proportion of those who remained unvaccinated in the USA , and the lack of data speci ﬁ c to Omicron transmission , these changes went too far . Contact tracing , or identifying and notifying the close contacts of con ﬁ rmed and probable cases , can be a highly effective method of disease control . Public health of ﬁ cials notify individuals that have been exposed to an infected individual , communicating in - formation about the need to quarantine following exposure and of the importance of isolating if they develop symptoms ( CDC , 2022b ) . Because it is resource - intensive d early estimates were that U . S . health departments needed to hire and train several hundred 1000 contact tracers to contact those exposed to the virus d contact tracing is most effective and ef ﬁ cient when there are relatively low levels of community transmission . Like many other aspects of the COVID - 19 pandemic response , this means that the use of contact tracing , and its effectiveness , has varied in accordance with trans - mission levels ( Armbruster & Brandeau , 2007 ; Lewis , 2020 ; Randall , 2021 ) . However , as 38 The COVID - 19 Response long as clinical outcomes associated with COVID - 19 remain potentially severe and we have tools to stop transmission , contact tracing needs to continue to be part of our approach to controlling the COVID - 19 pandemic . In addition to transmission levels , the number of asymptomatic infections and the availability of home - based testing are additional challenges to effective COVID - 19 con - tact tracing . With the surge of cases from the Omicron variant in late 2021 and early 2022 , some public health jurisdictions all but stopped contact tracing since the volume of cases meant contacts could not be reached until their quarantine period would have already been complete . Others modi ﬁ ed their approach toward electronic noti ﬁ cations or focused them on health education . Although contact tracing is a well - established tool for breaking transmission chains ( Hellewell et al . , 2020 ; Kojaku et al . , 2021 ) , wide - spread hesitancy to participating in contact tracing conducted by public health authorities d as high as 41 % in an October 2020 poll ( McClain & Rainie , 2020 ) d has also limited its effectiveness in COVID - 19 control . To increase effectiveness , contact tracing has also been carried out among various or - ganizations and entities beyond state and local health departments , including private companies , the National Football League ( NFL ) , and many colleges and universities . Companies trained their own employees to conduct internal contact tracing using freely available resources ( e . g . , massive open online courses or MOOCs ) , smart phone applica - tions , or hired vendors to provide contact tracing services . The NFL and other profes - sional sports leagues developed their own protocols , training internal staff to contact trace any cases identi ﬁ ed through frequent , required testing . Data from wearables helped contact tracers know where , how long , and with whom , players had recently been . The use of wearables was adopted by other organizations like the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) for competitions like the NCAA men ’ s basketball tournament , known as March Madness . Professional sports organizations d like health departments and large companies d have cross - trained operations staff , athletic trainers , and others who previously worked in health and safety to contact trace positive cases among players and their close contacts . Colleges and universities also worked closely with health departments to conduct contact tracing on their campuses and to support contact tracing efforts in their com - munities . Yale University , in coordination with the New Haven Health Department and the Connecticut Department of Public Health , trained nearly 200 student volun - teers to work as contact tracers , mostly from their public health , medicine , and nursing programs ( Niccolai et al . , 2021 ) . At Boston University ’ s Healthway , the or - ganization that manages COVID - 19 on campus , more than half of the contact tracing staff was recruited from the graduate public health program . Robust , often student staffed , contact tracing programs on university campuses supported the high fre - quency testing approaches needed to keep campuses safe and helped identify asymp - tomatic infections . For example , at Duke University cases identi ﬁ ed through contact Implementing public health control measures 39 tracing accounted for nearly three - quarters of asymptomatic cases during the fall 2020 semester , cases that would not have been found through symptomatic testing ( Denny et al . , 2020 ) . Movement and travel The very nature of the COVID - 19 pandemic demonstrates the need for a global perspec - tive on prevention , risk reduction , and pandemic response . From the beginning of the pandemic , the City of Wuhan in Hubei Province , China , was effectively shut off from the rest of the world when the Chinese government quarantined 11 million residents before also locking down millions more in neighboring cities ( Graham - Harrison & Kuo , 2020 ) . In Europe , the Schengen Borders Code provides Schengen Member States with the purview to reintroduce internal border controls in response to grave public con - cerns ( European Commission , 2022 ) . Throughout the course of the pandemic , border control measures have been implemented in accordance with changing disease burden and transmission dynamics , limiting movement across otherwise dissolved internal bor - ders ( Guild , 2021 ) . Their success has been mixed . Early screenings for entrance to the U . S . were centered around resource - intensive tem - perature and symptom screenings and resulted in the identi ﬁ cation of only one case per 85 , 000 passengers screened ( Dollard et al . , 2020 ) . As of October 2021 , proof of vaccination is required for all non - U . S . citizens and non - U . S . immigrants entering the U . S . through airports ( CDC , 2022a ) . As of January 2022 , non - U . S . travelers entering via land borders will also be required to meet vaccination requirements . Additionally , all individuals 2 years of age or older d including U . S . citizens and lawful permanent residents d entering the U . S . must also have a negative COVID - 19 test no more than 24 h before departure or provide proof of COVID - 19 recovery from the past 90 days . In circumstances where in - dividuals entering the USA have a valid vaccine exemption , selfquarantine for 5 days upon arrival into the USA is required in addition to a negative test . While pandemic risks function on a global scale , international travel bans provided only temporary or , if any , bene ﬁ ts for reducing COVID - 19 transmission ( Errett et al . , 2020 ) . Rapid and systematic reviews have found that the epidemiological effectiveness of border closures and international travel bans are primarily supported by evidence derived from modeling studies rather than real - world data ( Burns , 2020 , 2021 ) . As seen with the travel bans introduced against Southern Africa nations after the identi ﬁ ca - tion of the Omicron variant there , travel bans can also discourage countries from trans - parency with regard to data sharing and disease surveillance , as well as reinforce racism and discrimination . As with many other facets of COVID - 19 pandemic response , a layered approach that includes masking , disinfection and hygiene protocols , and posttra - vel test and trace programs , is the best strategy for minimizing risk while allowing for more normal population movement ( Bielecki et al . , 2021 ) . 40 The COVID - 19 Response Masks and face coverings While masking has been a common practice in many East Asian cultures at least since the 2003 SARS outbreak , western countries , including the U . A , have faced appreciable pop - ulation push - back on public health mandates broadly and masking mandates speci ﬁ cally . Early studies of mask wearing in Hong Kong after SARS found that perceived suscepti - bility and perceived bene ﬁ ts were both predictive of individual mask wearing ( Tang & Wong , 2004 ) . Follow - up studies investigating the sociocultural factors driving mask wearing have highlighted factors outside of health beliefs with important implications community and public health practice . For example , during the height of the SARS outbreak , face coverings were considered to be symbols of civic duty and a visible show of support for healthcare systems , in addition to being a means of personal protec - tion ( Siu , 2016 ) . Lacking federal guidelines , mask mandates have not been uniformly implemented or enforced across the U . S . Leading up to the 2020 presidential election , then nominee Joe Biden advocated for state governments to implement a three - month mask mandate while simultaneously appealing to the American people to adopt mask wearing in the absence of state - led initiatives ( AJMC , 2020 ) . This Biden Administration ’ s pandemic response plan echoed these messages , initially calling for the mitigation of the spread of COVID - 19 through expanded masking ( White House , 2021 ) . However , as vaccination became more widely available , masking was deemphasized by federal , state , and local public health authorities . In May 2021 , with less than 40 % of the U . S . population fully vaccinated , the CDC lifted mask requirements for vaccinated individuals ( Edwards et al . , 2021 ) . The lack of universal guidance on masking made control of the Delta wave , which began to surge in July 2021 , even more dif ﬁ cult , despite vaccination coverage increasing to nearly 70 % ( McEvoy , 2021 ) . Masking guidance shifted again in response to the massive surges of cases , hospitalizations , and deaths that resulted from widespread transmission of the Omicron variant in the USA . As of January 2022 , the CDC again recommended indoor masking in areas of substantial or high COVID - 19 transmission , which covered all but two U . S . counties ( Simmons - Duf ﬁ n et al . , 2022 ) . At the same time , some Mayors and Governors renewed emergency declarations to reinstate city - and state - level indoor mask mandates . However , as of January 20 , 2022 , only nine states , plus Washington , D . C . , and Puerto Rico , had mask mandates for indoor and public spaces ( Markowitz , 2022 ) . There is ample evidence to support the utility of mask wearing as a means of risk reduction . Some of the earliest data came from a so - called natural experiment in Kansas . After the Governor of Kansas issued an executive order requiring masks in public spaces on July 3 , 2020 , counties were allowed to opt out of the requirement . After July 3 , the 24 Kansas counties that complied with the Governor ’ s executive order saw decreased Implementing public health control measures 41 incidence of COVID - 19 , while the 81 counties that opted out saw a continued increase in new cases ( Van Dyke et al . , 2020 ) . Overall , during the height of the Delta wave , states that implemented mask mandates had lower COVID - 19 incidence per capita ( Joo et al . , 2021 ) . In another study of 15 states , daily case rates decreased following mask measure implementation compared with the 5 days prior to the mask mandate ’ s implementation ( Lyu , 2020 ) . From March to October 2020 , weekly hospitalization rates declined appre - ciably in the weeks following mask mandates compared to hospitalization rates in the month preceding the mandate ( Joo et al . , 2021 ) . In addition to population - level data , there was evidence of mask effectiveness at the individual level . In one Missouri hair salon , masking prevented COVID - 19 transmission from two symptomatic stylists to nearly 140 patrons ( Hendrix et al . , 2020 ) . In the end , mask wearing is an individual decision that is in many cases made indepen - dent of governmental mandates ( Rader et al . , 2021 ) . Social cultural factors and the nature of COVID - 19 play important roles in the decision to wear a mask . Therefore , public health must consider the changing dynamics of social perceptions and health beliefs when imple - menting mask guidance . Effective communication , role - modeling , and community engagement are critical for maximizing the uptake and effectiveness of all NPIs ( Doogan et al . , 2020 ) . Masking d with its dual bene ﬁ ts to both the wearer and to others d appears to sit directly on the battle lines between individual - and population - level actions that pro - tect health . Limits to gatherings and congregate spaces Because SARS - CoV - 2 is a respiratory pathogen , crowded and congregate settings pose signi ﬁ cant transmission risk . Large gatherings like sporting events , concerts , weddings , and religious services , among others , and congregate settings like theaters , restaurants and bars , and stadiums , create high - contact environments , where preventive and control measures are dif ﬁ cult to effectively implement ( CDC , 2021a ) . However , cessation of these events and closing congregate spaces has appreciable social and economic impact ( Basahel et al . , 2021 ; DeSouza et al . , 2021 ; Richter , 2020 ) . Therefore , there have been inconsistent public health guidelines on the size and required safety measures for gatherings and congregate spaces . Indoor dining is considered to be a high - risk activity . One study found that cities with indoor dining closures had a more than 60 % decrease in six - week COVID - 19 case rates compared to cities without indoor dining closures ( Schnake - Mahl et al . , 2021 ) . Another study , including both indoor and outdoor dining spaces , found that both case rates and mortality rates increased when on - premises dining was permitted ( Guy , Massetti , & Sauber - Schatz , 2021 ) . Following the relaxation of indoor dining re - strictions in all 50 US states after March 1 , 2021 , the daily rate of COVID - 19 infections increased after 40 days , and COVID - 19 deaths increased after 60 days ( Guy , Lee , et al . , 42 The COVID - 19 Response 2021 ) . However , following risk mitigation guidance such as lowering operational ca - pacity , upgrading mechanical ventilation , and implementing robust environmental sanitation practices has also been shown to help reduce transmission risk in indoor din - ing settings . Fitness centers also pose signi ﬁ cant risk , primarily for presymptomatic and asymp - tomatic transmission . In Hawaii , a cluster of COVID - 19 cases was linked to a presymp - tomatic ﬁ tness center instructor who taught classes in an environment with limited physical distancing and poor ventilation ( Groves et al . , 2021 ) . Another ﬁ tness center - related cluster occurred following a high - intensity exercise class in Chicago , where 67 % of attendees were later identi ﬁ ed as cases ( Lendacki et al . , 2021 ) . Similar to indoor dining , the combined effects of masking , surface sanitation , limited air recir - culation , and utilization of high ﬁ ltration and disinfection devices can reduce risk ( Li , Shankar et al . , 2021 ) . This is important since the maintenance of exercise routines dur - ing the pandemic has been shown to be protective against negative changes to mental health and well - being . Church services , weddings , and other large gatherings are also potentially high risk for COVID - 19 transmission . In a rural Arkansas church , roughly 38 % of church event at - tendees were infected with COVID - 19 following exposure to the index cases d the pastor and his wife d with an attack rate of over 59 % for attendees 19 e 64 years old ( James et al . , 2020 ) . Following two - and - a - half - hour choir practice with 122 singers in Skagit County , Washington , 53 of the singers were identi ﬁ ed as con ﬁ rmed or probable cases , and the super spreader event had a hospitalization rate of 5 . 7 % and a mortality rate of 3 . 7 % ( Hamner et al . , 2020 ) . A cluster with a mortality rate of nearly 18 % was identi ﬁ ed in Chicago following multifamily gatherings in February and March of 2020 ( Ghinai et al . , 2020 ) . Among a highly vaccinated population ( 74 % ) in Barnstable County , Mas - sachusetts , 469 COVID - 19 cases were identi ﬁ ed among individuals who attended large public gatherings in July 2021 ( Brown et al . , 2021 ) . Again , given the potential for social support to be a positive predictor of mental health during the pandemic , alternative types of gatherings enabled by web - conferencing as well as online cultural events could offer some bene ﬁ ts while minimizing risks . These examples highlight the importance of measures that limit the number and duration of contacts to reduce wide - spread transmission risk as well as the balance that must be achieved to protect mental health . While the most straight - forward method for accomplishing these objectives is closures , the sociocultural , economic , and psycho - logical impacts of such closures cannot be ignored ( Kojaku et al . , 2021 ) . Therefore , the simultaneous use of a wide range of NPIs and pharmaceutical interventions like vaccine mandates can provide adequate risk management and allow for the safer resumption of public and congregate activities . Implementing public health control measures 43 Schools and instructional modes The start of school has long been associated with seasonal spikes of respiratory pathogens . For example , prior to the introduction of wide - spread measles vaccination , consistent biennial epidemic peaks were observed in alignment with the academic calendar ( Fine & Clarkson , 1982 ) . Similar observations have been made for both in ﬂ uenza and mumps ( Lipsitch & Viboud , 2009 ) . In France , school holidays correspond with a 20 % e 29 % reduction in the transmission rate of in ﬂ uenza among children ( Cauchemez et al . , 2008 ) . Because transmission risk is driven in part by the indoor congregation of suscep - tible individuals in schools , school closures are potential tools for the control of transmis - sion ( Lipsitch & Viboud , 2009 ) . Although both modeling and epidemiological studies of school closures have demon - strated risk reduction associated with closures , failure to limit other gatherings of school - aged children ( e . g . , extracurricular activities ) and school staff often limit their effectiveness . A study in Georgia demonstrated that in - school clusters were driven by both educator - to - educator and educator - to - student transmission pathways ( Gold et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , ambiguity remains about the most effective frequency and duration of closures and best practices for maximizing impact while minimizing time away from in - person in - struction ( Jackson et al . , 2013 , 2014 ; Ruijs et al . , 2011 ; Sugisaki et al . , 2013 ) . There is however , little ambiguity about the negative social , physical , and mental health toll that school closures places on school - aged children and their families . During the latest Omicron surge , staf ﬁ ng shortages , rather than concerns about COVID - 19 transmission in schools , forced many schools districts back to virtual learning . The relationship between community levels of transmission and in - school transmis - sion rates is important to consider as part of decisions about school closures and instruc - tional modes . In areas with low levels of community transmission , in - person school has not corresponded with increased disease incidence . However , in areas with moderate to high levels of community transmission , in - person learning was associated with increases in COVID - 19 transmission ( Goldhaber et al . , 2021 ) . Layered prevention strategies are vital for controlling in - school transmission . After schools reopened in Israel , schools not adhering to masking and distancing closed after only 2 weeks due to high prevalence and secondary transmission rates ( Stein - Zamir et al . , 2020 ) . Across the USA , even in schools where physical distancing was not possible , the use of other preventative measures like masking helped to maintain low in - school transmission rates ( Parks et al . 2021 ; Dawson et al . 2020 ; Hershow et al . , 2021 ; Zimmer - man et al . , 2021 ) . A pilot study conducted in St . Louis and Spring ﬁ eld , Missouri over a 2 - week period in December 2020 showed that implementing masking , physical distancing , and ventilation requirements allowed for in - person instruction while maintaining lower transmission rates than community rates ( Dawson et al . , 2020 ) . Similarly , in New York City public schools , asymptomatic surveillance testing showed that incidence rates and 44 The COVID - 19 Response prevalence were not higher than those of the community at large when schooling was conducted in person ( Varma et al . , 2021 ) . In addition to masking , ventilation , and distancing measures , test - to - stay programs have recently been implemented as an intervention that can reduce the number of in - person school days missed by a student who is a close contact of a positive case . In effect , test - to - stay programs utilize contact tracing and testing protocols to allow in - person learning during quarantine periods for close contacts following in - school exposure ( CDC , 2021c ) . In a study conducted in Lake County , Illinois , test - to - stay policies were estimated to preserve upwards of 8000 in - person days of instruction while also showing low secondary transmission in participating K - 12 schools ( Nemoto et al . , 2021 ) . However , test - to - stay requires complex logistical coordination between families and schools , as well as both ﬁ nancial and personnel costs , making these programs poten - tially infeasible in lower resourced school districts ( Harris - McCoy et al . , 2021 ) . Air ﬁ ltration Respiratory pathogens such as SARS , measles , tuberculosis , and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome pose serious transmission concerns in congregate and indoors spaces ( Luongo et al . , 2016 ) . Even well - ﬁ tted , medical - grade masks cannot completely block viral spread , which requires layers of protective measures for maximizing infection control ( Ueki et al . , 2020 ) . Air ﬁ ltration and viral inactivation measures are important tools for ﬁ ltering ambient viral particles and sanitizing public spaces . There are a range of options for air ﬁ ltration , environmental sanitation , and increased ventilation , which are part of NPIs . For example , in simulations , the combination of wearing masks and utilizing portable High Ef ﬁ ciency Particulate Air ( HEPA ) ﬁ lters in enclosed spaces reduced environmental exposure to aerosols ( Lindsley et al . , 2021 ) . In addition to increasing ventilation , air - cycling , duration of system running , and other ﬁ ltration parameters , ultraviolet ( UV ) germicidal irradiation can also mitigate trans - mission in high - risk , high - transmission settings such as schools , prisons , and healthcare facilities ( Guo et al . , 2021 ) . Clean Air Delivery Rate ( CADR ) and HEPA ratings are used to indicate the performance of air ﬁ ltration systems and devices , and the U . S . Envi - ronmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) recommends portable ﬁ ltration systems are HEPA designated , CADR rated , or remove particles smaller than 1 m m ( EPA , 2022 ) . Intro - ducing outdoor air by opening windows and doors can also help to increase air ﬂ ow and circulate fresh air . Limiting or stopping the use of demand - controlled ventilation sys - tems that modulate air circulation rates based on detected occupancy levels is another method for improving circulation . UV germicidal irradiation can supplement or comple - ment air ﬁ ltration systems when used in spaces with limited ventilation or applied to in - duct air ﬁ lters to clean air moving through ventilation systems ( CDC , 2021b ) . Implementing public health control measures 45 Prior to the COVID - 19 pandemic , there had been limited investigation into the causal relationship between HVAC systems and airborne pathogen transmission with most evidence coming from modeling studies . Emerging real - world evidence has sup - ported these ﬁ ndings . In student dorms , air sampling proved to be an informative surveil - lance technique , with positive air samples corresponding to same - ﬂ oor cases and 100 % detection in isolation dorms ( Sousan et al . , 2021 ) . An air sampling study of two sel ﬁ solat - ing cases with mild and severe symptoms detected SARS - CoV - 2 via samplers roughly 6 - 7 feet from the infected persons ( Shankar et al . , 2022 ) . Far UVC light has the same germicidal bene ﬁ ts of 254 nm UV light while being safer for human tissues , although there are limited data characterizing the impact of long - term exposure risk for eyes ( Buonanno et al . , 2020 ; Hessling et al . , 2020 ) . Within regulatory limits , 25 minutes of UVC exposure inactivates greater than 99 % of ambient coronavirus particles ( Buonanno et al . , 2020 ) . Krypton chloride excimer lamps , which emit 222 nm UVC irradiation , can be used in public spaces to inactivate ambient and surface virus ( Ma et al . , 2021 ) . Conclusion Multifaceted approaches to COVID - 19 control using a wide range of NPIs and pharma - ceutical interventions are needed to reduce contact rates and transmission risk . Quaran - tine and isolation practices are well - established tools for managing large - scale infectious disease threats . Travel restrictions and border closures provide limited bene ﬁ ts beyond the theoretical delay in disease introduction and , by extension , delayed community transmis - sion , and can disincentivize information sharing while promoting stigma . A combination of individual and population level protections , such as masking , vaccination , and envi - ronmental controls , adds protective layers to public heath ’ s Swiss cheese approach to pro - tecting populations during the COVID - 19 pandemic and reduces the potential for breaches that raise the level of community transmission . An integrated , layered approach to COVID - 19 control provides the best path forward for more safely resuming community - based , congregate , and public activities .
