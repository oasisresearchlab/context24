Vieira , Christophe Lamaze , Sandra L . Schmid * Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling was analyzed in mammalian cells conditionally defective for receptor - mediated endocytosis . EGF - dependent cell prolif - eration was enhanced in endocytosis - defective cells . However , early EGF - dependent signaling events were not uniformly up - regulated . A subset of signal transducers required the normal endocytic trafficking of EGFR for full activation . Thus , endocytic trafficking of activated EGFR plays a critical role not only in attenuating EGFR signaling but also in establishing and controlling specific signaling pathways . S ignaling by ligand - activated receptor ty - rosine kinases ( RTKs ) such as EGFR can elicit a wide range of cell type – specific re - sponses leading to proliferation or differen - tiation . EGF binding triggers dimerization and trans - or autophosphorylation of the receptor , followed by recruitment and acti - vation of SH2 ( src homology domain 2 ) or PTB ( phosphotyrosine binding ) domain – containing intracellular signal transducers ( 1 ) . Ligand binding also triggers the recruit - ment of EGFR to clathrin - coated pits , fol - lowed by internalization of the EGFR - li - gand complex and its delivery to lysosomes for degradation ( 2 ) . Although activated EGFR follows the canonical endocytic path - way ( 3 ) during this process of “down - regula - tion , ” RTK - specific regulators affecting sort - ing at both early ( 4 , 5 ) and late ( 6 , 7 ) trafficking steps have been identified . Many of these regulators , for example , snx - 1 ( sort - ing nexin 1 ) ( 6 ) and phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI - 3 - kinase ) ( 7 ) , appear to affect sorting of only a subset of RTKs . Why should RTKs have their own repertoire of intracel - lular trafficking regulators ? One possibility is that regulation of trafficking serves to mod - ulate RTK signaling . To examine whether EGFR endocytosis and trafficking are important for control - ling the signaling pathways and cellular re - sponses to EGF , we examined these events in cells conditionally and specifically defec - tive in clathrin - dependent receptor - mediat - ed endocytosis ( 8 ) . The conditional defect in endocytosis is imposed by the regulated expression of the Lys 44 3 Ala 44 ( K44A ) mutant form of dynamin ( 8 ) , a guanosine triphosphatase that is required for clathrin - coated vesicle formation ( 9 ) . Ligand - induced endocytosis of EGFR was potently inhibited in cells overexpress - ing K44A dynamin ( K44A cells ) as com - pared with cells overexpressing comparable amounts of wild - type dynamin ( WT cells ) ( Fig . 1A ) . In contrast , endocytosis of inac - tivated EGFR , defined as the basal rate and measured with mAb528 [ an antagonistic monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) to EGFR ] as ligand ( 10 ) , was not significantly affected ( Fig . 1A ) .

Intracellular accumulation of EGF in K44A cells ( Fig . 1A ) reached a steady state by 10 min , which suggests that intracellular ligand - receptor complexes are either rapidly degraded or recycled . To distinguish these two possibilities , we compared EGFR down - regulation and the surface expression of EGFR in WT and K44A cells . In the ab - sence of EGF , both WT and K44A cells expressed equal levels of the endogenous EGFR ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . In WT cells , after a brief lag , surface EGFR was degraded with a half - time of (cid:59) 30 min , whereas in K44A cells (cid:59) 80 % of EGFR was detected even 2 hours after EGF addition ( Fig . 1B ) . Correspond - ingly , EGFR was rapidly and efficiently cleared from the surface of WT cells but not K44A cells after addition of EGF ( Fig . 1C ) . Thus , after internalization at a basal rate , activated EGFR appeared to be efficiently recycled back to the cell surface in K44A cells , which is consistent with a previous model suggesting that endocytosis rates , not EGFR kinase activation , control EGFR down - regulation ( 10 ) . In the absence of EGF , neither K44A nor WT cells showed any significant loss of EGFR over the 2 - hour time course ( 12 ) . Thus , in K44A cells EGFR is not subject to normal ligand - induced in - tracellular trafficking and degradation . Responses to EGF were then analyzed in cells with WT or defective EGFR traffick - ing . First , as an endpoint of a complex series of signal transduction events , EGF - depen - dent proliferation of K44A and WT cells was measured after serum starvation . K44A cells showed increased EGF - dependent pro - liferation as assessed by either cell number – dependent catabolism of the dye MTT [ ( 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyl - tetrazolium bromide ] or [ 3 H ] thymidine in - corporation into DNA ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Furthermore , when K44A cells were grown in the presence of tetracycline to suppress mutant dynamin expression , they behaved indistinguishably from WT cells grown with or without induction of dynamin . Thus , overexpression of K44A dynamin , but not WT dynamin , enhanced the cell prolifera - tive response . Because the overexpression of WT or K44A dynamin does not alter the levels of endogenous EGFR , these results establish that defective endocytic traffick - ing of EGFR leads to enhanced EGF - dependent proliferation , which confirms that receptor - mediated endocytosis is criti - cal for attenuating EGFR signaling ( 13 ) . Early responses to EGF were examined by analyzing EGF - dependent tyrosine phospho - rylation in WT and K44A cells . After serum starvation , both WT and K44A cells showed significant EGF - dependent increases in ty - rosine phosphorylation , which indicates that overexpression of neither WT nor K44A dynamin led , in general , to EGF - indepen - dent activation of signaling pathways ( Fig . 2C ) . In contrast , several proteins were either hyperphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated in K44A cells relative to WT cells after EGF stimulation ( Fig . 2C ) . Thus , normal EGFR endocytic trafficking was required to trigger distinct signaling pathways . Fig . 2 . EGF - dependent proliferation and tyrosine phos - phorylation patterns in WT and K44A cells . ( A ) Serum - starved HeLa cells overexpressing either WT or K44A dynamin were treated with ( striped bars ) or without ( solid bars ) 4 nM EGF .

EGFR was tyrosine - phosphoryl - ated to a lesser extent in cells that overex - pressed K44A dynamin ( Fig . 3A ) than in either WT cells ( Fig . 4F ) or in noninduced K44A cells ( Fig . 3A ) . These differences were even more pronounced 20 min after addition of EGF , because EGFR degrada - tion would have begun in WT cells ( Fig . 3B ) . Thus , normal endocytic trafficking of activated EGFR was necessary to achieve full EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation . As is consistent with this observation , EGFR is hyperphosphorylated in endosomal versus plasma membrane fractions from rat liver ( 14 ) . Furthermore , we have confirmed that hypophosphorylated EGFR can trigger en - hanced proliferation ( 15 ) . Activation of mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinases was also suppressed in en - docytosis - defective cells , as measured by both tyrosine phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 ( Figs . 3C and 4F ) and by MAP kinase activity ( Fig . 3E ) . Thus , normal endocytic trafficking of EGFR is important for the full activation of MAP kinases ( 16 ) . The 85 - kD regulatory subunit of PI 3 - ki - nase ( p85 - PI3K ) can be tyrosine - phospho - rylated in response to EGF ( 17 ) , although p85 tyrosine phosphorylation does not nec - essarily correlate with activation of the PI3K catalytic subunit . We found p85 to be hypophosphorylated in endocytosis - defec - tive HeLa cells relative to WT cells in response to EGF ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . Because PI3K activity is required for regulating re - ceptor trafficking in endosomal compart - ments but not for internalization ( 7 ) , our findings may reflect preferential activation of p85 - PI3K during later events in intracel - luar trafficking of EGFR . In any case , these results provide an additional example of the requirement for correct EGFR trafficking in establishing specific signaling pathways . Among the signaling proteins that were hyperphosphorylated in endocytosis - defec - tive cells were PLC - (cid:103) ( Fig . 4 , A through C and F ) and SHC ( Fig . 4 , D and F ) . PLC - (cid:103) showed increased phosphorylation even in the absence of EGF , although there was not a general up - regulation of EGF - independent tyrosine phosphorylation ( Fig . 2C ) . The sig - nificance of this finding remains to be deter - mined . The hyperphosphorylation of PLC - (cid:103) and SHC or both ( 15 ) may be an important factor in the enhanced EGF - dependent hy - perproliferative pathway of these cells . Thus , in addition to initiating the clear - ance and down - regulation of the EGF - EGFR signaling complex , receptor traffick - ing plays a critical role in defining the signals transmitted by activated EGFR . Our results provide functional insight into the physiological significance of RTK - specific regulators of receptor trafficking . A com - parison of the mitogenic potencies of EGF ( which diverts internalized receptor - ligand complexes to late endosomes and lyso - somes ) and transforming growth factor – (cid:97) ( which dissociates from EGFR at mild acid - ic pH , allowing it to recycle from early endosomes ) suggests that EGFR ligands have evolved to regulate their signals by controlling EGFR trafficking ( 18 ) . Signal transducing molecules have been shown to affect membrane trafficking ( 19 ) ; here we present evidence that this regulation can flow in both directions , that is , that mem - brane trafficking can also regulate signal transduction events .

Holmes , Debra A . Fadool , Ruibao Ren , Irwin B . Levitan * The human Kv1 . 5 potassium channel ( hKv1 . 5 ) contains proline - rich sequences identical to those that bind to Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains . Direct association of the Src tyrosine kinase with cloned hKv1 . 5 and native hKv1 . 5 in human myocardium was observed . This interaction was mediated by the proline - rich motif of hKv1 . 5 and the SH3 domain of Src . Furthermore , hKv1 . 5 was tyrosine phosphorylated , and the channel current was sup - pressed , in cells coexpressing v - Src . These results provide direct biochemical evidence for a signaling complex composed of a potassium channel and a protein tyrosine kinase . P otassium channels are important for such cellular electrical properties as resting poten - tial , excitability , and the repolarization of the action potential . Thus , modulation of these channels can profoundly affect physiological processes including neuronal integration , ves - icle secretion , and muscle contraction . The modulation of potassium channel activity by serine - threonine kinases has been studied ex - tensively ( 1 ) . The recently discovered PYK2 tyrosine kinase ( 2 ) , as well as endogenous tyrosine kinases in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cells ( 3 ) , can also phosphorylate and suppress the activity of potassium chan - nels . In spite of emerging evidence concern - ing the functional effects of tyrosine phospho - rylation of potassium channels , there is no information available about the mechanisms of targeting and association of these channels with tyrosine kinases . However , the existence of signaling complexes consisting of ion chan - nels and closely associated protein kinases and phosphatases has been inferred from biochem - ical and functional electrophysiological stud - ies ( 4 ) . Specific protein - protein interactions be - tween signaling proteins are mediated by modular binding domains ( 5 ) . Among the first of these to be characterized was a con - served sequence found in the Src tyrosine kinase , known as the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain . SH3 domains bind to proline - rich regions in partner proteins . We examined the sequences of mammalian voltage - dependent potassium channels , and noted that several species isoforms of Kv1 . 5—including those from human ( hKv1 . 5 ) , dog , and rabbit ( 6 ) — contain one to two copies of the preferred Src SH3 domain binding motif RPLPXXP ( 7 , 8 ) . In particular , hKv1 . 5 contains two repeats of the sequence RPLPPLP between amino acid residues 65 and 82 of the channel protein ( 6 , 8 , 9 ) . To determine whether hKv1 . 5 and Src are associated in vivo , we coexpressed the channel and kinase in HEK 293 cells and tested for their interaction by immunoprecipi - tation followed by protein immunoblotting with specific antibodies to hKv1 . 5 and Src ( 10 ) . When hKv1 . 5 and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with a specific antibody , Src was co - precipi - tated ( Fig . 1A ) . Similarly , when Src and as - sociated proteins were immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cell lysates , hKv1 . 5 co - precip - itated with endogenous and coexpressed Src ( Fig . 1A ) . Expression of hKv1 . 5 protein was not altered by v - Src coexpression , as verified by protein immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with antibodies directed against tagged ( Fig . 1A ) and native ( Fig . 2A ) sequences of the channel . Furthermore , immunoblot ( Fig . 1A ) or protein silver stain ( Fig . 3A ) analysis of immunoprecipitates demonstrated that the ef - ficiency of immunoprecipitation of hKv1 . 5 was not affected by v - Src coexpression . Enzy - matic activity of Src also co - precipitated with hKv1 . 5 , as detected by an in vitro kinase assay with hKv1 . 5 immunoprecipitates and an Src - specific substrate ( 11 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . The association between hKv1 . 5 and Src was also observed in human tissue . Native Src was detected in immunoprecipitates , prepared with a Kv1 . 5 antiserum , from hu - man myocardium ventricle tissue lysates ( Fig . 1C ) . The native Src that co - immuno - precipitated with native Kv1 . 5 co - migrated on protein immunoblots with native Src , immunoprecipitated directly with a poly - clonal anti - Src antibody ( Fig . 1C ) . Thus association of hKv1 . 5 and Src occurs under physiological conditions , and does not de - pend on expression in a heterologous sys - tem . This association may contribute to the co - localization of Kv1 . 5 and Src in cellular adhesion zones in myocardium ( 12 ) . Al - though the stoichiometry of the association between hKv1 . 5 and Src is not known , only a fraction of the total myocardial Src co - immunoprecipitated with hKv1 . 5 ( Fig . 1C ) , consistent with the fact that Src phosphor - ylates other substrates . There are specific sequence requirements for the association of hKv1 . 5 and Src . For example the NH 2 - terminal region of the rat Kv1 . 5 ( rKv1 . 5 ) channel also contains a pro - T . C .
