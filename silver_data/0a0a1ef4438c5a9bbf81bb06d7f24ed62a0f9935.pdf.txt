De Camilli , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , and approved August 28 , 2002 ( received for review June 27 , 2002 ) Actin is an abundant component of nerve terminals that has been implicated at multiple steps of the synaptic vesicle cycle , including reversible anchoring , exocytosis , and recycling of synaptic vesicles . In the present study we used the lamprey reticulospinal synapse to examine the role of actin at the site of synaptic vesicle recycling , the endocytic zone . Compounds interfering with actin function , including phalloidin , the catalytic subunit of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin , and N - ethylmaleimide - treated myosin S1 fragments were microinjected into the axon . In unstimulated , phalloidin - injected axons actin ﬁlaments formed a thin cytomatrix adjacent to the plasma membrane around the synaptic vesicle cluster . The ﬁla - ments proliferated after stimulation and extended toward the vesicle cluster . Synaptic vesicles were tethered along the ﬁlaments . Injection of N - ethylmaleimide - treated myosin S1 fragments caused accumulation of aggregates of synaptic vesicles between the endocytic zone and the vesicle cluster , suggesting that vesicle transport was inhibited . Phalloidin , as well as C2 toxin , also caused changes in the structure of clathrin - coated pits in stimulated synapses . Our data provide evidence for a critical role of actin in recycling of synaptic vesicles , which seems to involve functions both in endocytosis and in the transport of recycled vesicles to the synaptic vesicle cluster . S ynaptic communication depends on local recycling of synaptic vesicles in nerve terminals . A major recycling pathway involves retrieval by means of clathrin - coated pits ( 1 – 3 ) . The basic features of this process are shared with that of clathrin - dependent endocy - tosis in nonneuronal cells ( 4 ) . It involves recruitment of clathrin by adaptors to the membrane followed by polymerization of the clathrin coat . A clathrin - coated pit grows progressively along with an invagination of the coated membrane . After a deeply invagi - nated coated pit has formed , the base of the pit is cut off resulting in formation of a free coated vesicle . A range of accessory proteins havebeenidentified , whicharethoughttoregulatedifferentaspects of the endocytic process ( 2 ) . Many of these proteins interact with components of the actin - regulating machinery , which has pointed to a coupling between endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton ( 2 , 5 , 6 ) . Such a coupling is also supported by the observation of actin tails at moving endocytic vesicles ( 7 – 10 ) . Disruption of actin function has been shown to inhibit endocytosis in some but not all cell types ( 11 – 14 ) . In nerve terminals clathrin - mediated budding occurs in an endocytic zone of the plasma membrane , which surrounds the release site ( 1 , 3 ) . Several observations indicate that actin filaments are present in this synaptic compartment . Studies of the denervated frog neuromuscular junction have shown that phalloidin labeling accumulates around rather than within re - lease sites ( 15 ) . In cell - free synaptosome preparations actin was identified by immunogold labeling in regions containing endo - cytic intermediates associated with filaments ( 16 ) . Moreover , a filamentous cytomatrix was found to proliferate in the endocytic zone of the lamprey reticulospinal synapse after disruption of synaptojanin function ( 17 ) . Perturbation of this polyphospho - inositide phosphatase increases the levels of phosphoinositides , which are known to stimulate actin polymerization ( 18 ) . Al - though these morphological observations support an involve - ment of actin filaments in synaptic vesicle recycling , functional evidence is as yet lacking . Extracellular application of actin - depolymerizing compounds at intact synapses has not been found to produce consistent effects on vesicle recycling ( 19 – 22 ) . We have now used the lamprey giant reticulospinal synapse to examine the effects of specific disruption of the presynaptic actin cytoskeleton . The reticulospinal axon is large and unbranched , which allows compounds to be microinjected in the vicinity of the release sites . By combining presynaptic microinjections with subsequent microscopic analysis we show that disruption of actin filaments in the endocytic zone is associated with impaired recycling of synaptic vesicles . Materials and Methods Preparation and Testing of Reagents . Rhodamine - or Oregon green 488 - linked phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , R - 415 ; O - 7466 ) was mixed with injection buffer ( 250 mM K acetate (cid:2) 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 ) at 300 units (cid:2) 250 (cid:1) l . Synapsin antibodies [ G - 304 ( 23 ) ] were labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 ( Molecular Probes , A - 10239 ) . The catalytic C2I component of Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin was obtained from H . Barth , University of Freiburg , Freiburg , Germany , and tested in an ADP - ribosylation assay ( 24 ) . In both lamprey spinal cord and rat brain extracts , a single band with a molecular weight corresponding to actin was ADP - ribosylated ( see Fig . 4 ) . Rabbit S1 myosin fragments ( Sigma ) were treated with N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) ( Sigma ) as described ( 25 ) . NEM - treated myosin subfragment 1 ( NEM - S1 ) was prepared fresh for each microinjection experiment and tested for binding to (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:3) - actin in vitro . Bovine actin was polymerized in 75 mM KCl (cid:2) 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 (cid:2) 10 mM imidazole (cid:2) 1 mM EGTA for 5 min at room temperature ( pH 7 . 2 ) with or without ATP . Samples were incubated for 15 min after addition of NEM - S1 ( 1 mM ) and then centrifuged at 200 , 000 (cid:1) g for 20 min at 15°C . Both supernatant and pellet were analyzed by SDS (cid:2) PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . An increased binding of S1 to the pellet was consistently observed in the NEM - S1 (cid:2) ATP sample . Pellets were also adsorbed on formvar - coated grids and negatively stained with 1 % uranyl acetate and examined in a Philips CM12 electron microscope . A consistent decoration of actin filaments with NEM - S1 was observed ( not shown ) . The C2 toxin and NEM - S1 were dialyzed against injection buffer and then mixed with an injection marker [ Cy5 - labeled GST , 10 : 1 – 5 : 1 ( 26 ) ] , which had been dialyzed against the same buffer . Control axons were injected with Cy5 - GST alone which This paper was submitted directly ( Track II ) to the PNAS ofﬁce .

Microinjection . Pressure microinjection into lamprey ( Lampetra fluviatilis ) giant reticulospinal axons and subsequent stimulation was performed as described ( 23 , 26 , 27 ) . The physiological solution contained either a normal Ca 2 (cid:2) level ( 2 . 6 mM ; stimu - lated specimens ) or a reduced level ( 0 . 1 mM Ca 2 (cid:2) with 4 mM Mg 2 (cid:2) ; specimens maintained at rest ) . Experiments with phal - loidin microinjections were also performed in Ca 2 (cid:2) - free solution containing 10 mM EGTA . This condition , which strongly sup - presses vesicle cycling ( 28 ) , was used to ensure that the filaments detected at resting synapses were not due to low levels of vesicle turnover . The specimens were maintained in this solution for at least 30 min before injections . Action potential stimulation was performed at a rate of 5 Hz . Earlier studies of the reticulospinal synapse have shown that at this rate of stimulation recycling keeps pace with release even after prolonged stimulation , but after perturbation of the syn - aptic vesicle cycle depletion of vesicles occurs ( 17 , 26 ) . In the present experiments stimulation periods of 2 , 5 , 15 , and 30 min were used . Prolonged exposure with phalloidin ( exceeding 30 min ) can also induce complex structural changes including actin bundling and proliferation of actin - like filaments outside syn - apses ( not shown ) . Proliferation of actin filaments in axoplasm after prolonged exposure to phalloidin has been reported ( 29 ) . Electron Microscopy . Stimulation was ended by replacing the physiological solution with 3 % glutaraldehyde (cid:2) 0 . 5 % parafor - maldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) , or with 3 % glutaraldehyde (cid:2) 4 % tannic acid in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Tannic acid treatment was used to enhance the visibility of actin filaments . The specimens were embedded in Durcupan ACM ( Fluka ) , as described ( 17 ) . For each experimental condi - tion a minimum of five serially cut synapses from at least two different axons were examined . In most experiments both un - injected and GST - Cy5 - injected axons were used as controls ( 17 , 26 ) . Endocytic intermediates were quantified as described ( 17 ) . Fluorescence Microscopy . Microinjections were monitored with a charged coupled device detector ( Princeton Instruments , Tren - ton , NJ ) . Images were used to identify the injected axons and to judge the relative concentration of injected compounds ( 27 ) . To obtain high - resolution images of fluorescence in living axons ( Fig . 1 ) , the spinal cord was removed from the recording chamber , mounted with the ventral side down on a coverslip , and then analyzed with an inverted fluorescence microscope ( Nikon Diaphot 300 ) or a confocal microscope system ( Odyssey XL , Noran Instruments , Middleton , WI ) . To record the intensity of the fluorescent structures in stimulated axons , the injection was performed in normal Ringer’s solution . The specimen was then quickly removed from the recording chamber and maintained for 5 min in solution with 30 mM K (cid:2) . Resting specimens were maintained in Ca 2 (cid:2) - free solution with 10 mM EGTA during the injection and image recording . Confocal images were sampled at 0 . 1 - (cid:1) m steps ( (cid:1) 63 objective , numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) . For each fluorescent structure , the average pixel intensity of the whole ring - like structure was quantified in the focal plane located in the center of the collected image stack and then normalized to the background level measured in an adjacent control region . Results Phalloidin Identifies a Dynamic Actin Cytomatrix in the Endocytic Zone . To investigate the distribution of actin filaments in living reticulospinal axons , we first used phalloidin , which binds to and stabilizes actin filaments . Microinjection of fluorophore - coupled phalloidin resulted in accumulation of ring - shaped fluorescent structures at the inner surface of the living axon ( Fig . 1 A – F ) . The location of the fluorescent rings relative to synapses was studied by coinjecting Oregon green - coupled phalloidin with Alexa - linked synapsin antibodies . These antibodies have been shown to bind to synaptic vesicle clusters ( 23 ) . The synapsin antibodies decorated the center of the rings ( Fig . 1 B – D ) confirming that the phalloidin - labeled structures surrounded synaptic release sites . We then tested whether the phalloidin rings were affected by synaptic activity . Microinjections were performed either in resting axons maintained in Ca 2 (cid:2) - free solution or in axons stimulated with 30 mM K (cid:2) , respectively ( see Materials and Fig . 1 .

Fluorescent rings of similar shape were observed under both conditions , although they seemed somewhat dimmer under resting conditions ( Fig . 1 E ) than during stimulation ( Fig . 1 F ) . Comparison of the averaged fluorescence intensity of the phalloidin - labeled rings showed that it was higher during stim - ulation as compared with rest ( P (cid:5) 0 . 01 , t test ; Fig . 1 G ) . We next studied the effects of phalloidin at synapses with electron microscopy . In resting axons ( Fig . 2 A ) synapses con - tained dense synaptic vesicle clusters surrounded by vesicle - free cytoplasm . Endocytic intermediates were only occasionally ob - served and were absent in most of the synapses studied in serial ultrathin sections . A thin filamentous cytomatrix could be de - tected in the cytoplasm of the endocytic zone adjacent to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 A and B ) , consistent with phalloidin labeling under these conditions . The lateral extension from the margin of the active zone did not exceed 1 (cid:1) m ( Fig . 2 A and C ) . A similar cytomatrix seemed to be present also in resting uninjected axons , although it was often much less prominent or below the limits of detection ( see Fig . 5 A ) . After action potential stimulation , several striking changes occurred in the endocytic zone of phalloidin - injected axons ( Fig . 3 ) . First , the filamentous cytomatrix was expanded ( Fig . 3 A – C ) consistent with the increase in phalloidin fluorescence observed by light microscopy . The filaments also showed a change in organization . Distinct strands of filaments were now seen instead of an unstructured filamentous material ( small arrows in Fig . 3 B – E ; for images of stimulated control synapses see ref . 27 ) . The filaments could be traced from the endocytic zone to the periphery of the vesicle cluster . Second , synaptic vesicles were tethered to the filaments ( Fig . 3 A – D ) . Their distribution apart from the vesicle cluster suggested that they could represent recycled vesicles moving from the endocytic zone to the cluster . Moreover , an effect on clathrin - coated pits was observed in the endocytic zone ( Fig . 3 D and E ) . In addition to coated pits with a normal morphology , a proportion of the coated pits had very long unconstricted necks ( Fig . 3 D and E ) . The occurrence of such coated pits depended on the concentration of phalloidin in the axon and could reach in single synapses up to 50 % of the total Fig . 3 .

( D and E ) Sections from a different synapse in the same specimen as in C .

Because coated pits with this morphology have not been ob - served at this synapse previously , we assume that they were specifically induced by phalloidin ( 3 ) . Clathrin - coated pits , in - cluding those with extended necks , were sometimes seen to be contacting actin - like filaments ( Fig . 3 E ) . Perturbation of Actin Filaments with C2 Toxin and Myosin Fragments Impairs Vesicle Recycling . The effects of phalloidin indicated that the actin - containing cytomatrix participates in synaptic vesicle recycling . To examine this possibility further , we tested the effect of disrupting actin polymerization with the enzymatic C2I subunit of C . botulinum C2 toxin ( 24 ) . The effect of the toxin was studied in synapses either maintained at rest or after 30 min stimulation at 5 Hz . In both conditions , the filamentous cyto - matrix could not be detected in the endocytic zone after micro - injection of the C2I subunit ( Fig . 4 ) . Moreover , the synaptic vesicle clusters were greatly reduced in stimulated ( Fig . 4 B ) , but not in unstimulated ( Fig . 4 A ) axons . At least part of the vesicle depletion seemed to be due to an impaired retrieval of vesicle membrane , because the presynaptic plasma membrane in the endocytic zone was expanded ( Fig . 4 B and C ) . Clathrin - coated pits with a distorted morphology were observed on expanded portions of the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4 C ) . An effect of the C2 toxin on membrane retrieval was further supported by analysis of stimulated synapses far from the injection site [ (cid:6) 500 (cid:1) m , where the concentration of C2 toxin was lower ( 27 ) ] . Under these conditions ( Fig . 4 D ) vesicle clusters were not depleted , but the number of clathrin - coated pits was increased approximately 4 - fold as compared with synapses from uninjected axons from the same specimen ( P (cid:5) 0 . 001 ; t test ; n (cid:3) 6 serially sectioned synapses ) . Moreover , the proportion of coated pits with wide necks ( ‘‘stage 2 , ’’ see ref . 28 , was increased from 26 % in stimulated uninjected control axons to 67 % in injected axons ( P (cid:5) 0 . 001 ; n (cid:3) 6 ; t test ) . Involvement of the actin cytomatrix in synaptic vesicle recy - cling was also probed with an actin filament - binding compound . The subfragment 1 ( S1 ) of myosin was pretreated with NEM , which inhibits dissociation of the bound fragment ( 25 ) . The ability of the fragments to bind actin filaments was verified in in vitro assays and at the ultrastructural level by negative staining ( see Materials and Methods ) .

After stimulation at 5 Hz ( 30 min ) , the filamentous cyto - matrix lateral to the active zone was clearly visible ( Fig . 5 B , thin arrow ) . Vesicles seemed to be associated with filaments in the cytomatrix , and the cluster was depleted almost completely ( Fig . 5 B ) . Scattered synaptic vesicles could also be detected in the cytoplasm outside the synaptic area ( not shown ) . Effects of NEM - S1 on clathrin - coated pits were not observed . Clathrin - coated pits were similar in structure and number to those in stimulated control synapses . We also examined synapses located far from the injection site ( (cid:6) 500 (cid:1) m ) . At these synapses the vesicle cluster was only partly depleted ( Fig . 5 C ) , whereas large aggregates of synaptic vesicles occurred lateral to the active zones . Axons injected with NEM - S1 were then subjected to only brief stimulation ( 2 min ) . Under these conditions , synapses located close to the injection site contained large vesicle clusters ( Fig . 5 D ) . Lateral to the cluster synaptic vesicles occurred in strands extending between the endocytic zone and the periphery of the vesicle cluster . Such strands of vesicles were observed consistently in serial sections of synapses in NEM - S1 - injected axons , but not in adjacent control axons . In the axons injected with NEM - S1 and stimulated for 2 min , the number of synaptic vesicles lateral to the vesicle cluster was more than three times higher than in synapses in adjacent uninjected giant axons ( n (cid:3) 6 in each case ; P (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) . We did not , however , observe the regular ‘‘arrowhead’’ decoration of filaments ( evident in vitro ; see Materials and Methods ) in the intact synapse , most likely because of lower concentrations of NEM - S1 at synapses after microinjection . Discussion The coupling between synaptic activity and the occurrence of clathrin - coated intermediates at the plasma membrane around synaptic release sites has been documented at a variety of central and peripheral synapses ( 1 , 3 , 30 , 31 ) . This region has been defined as a distinct synaptic compartment , the endocytic zone , on the basis of light microscopic studies in Drosophila . The dynamin - binding protein Dap160 (cid:2) intersectin was shown to be accumulated in this region ( 32 ) , and other endocytic proteins including dynamin and endophilin have been localized to this area in stimulated Drosophila synapses ( 33 , 34 ) . Our recent immunogold studies in lamprey synapses have shown that dy - namin can be detected in the endocytic zone after stimulation ( E . Evergren , N . T . , H . Gad , P . L . , L . B . , and O . S . , unpublished observations ) . Here we localized actin to this compartment at a central synapse and showed that it is linked with synaptic vesicle recycling . The three different compounds used , phalloidin , C2I toxin , and NEM - S1 , are all known to affect actin specifically by different mechanisms . Our observation that each compound affected the trafficking of vesicles at endocytic zones strongly indicates that actin is a component of the endocytic protein machinery around synaptic release sites . Actin - like filaments could be detected in the endocytic zone in resting synapses even after suppression of vesicle cycling in Ca 2 (cid:2) - free solution . Under these conditions the cytomatrix ap - peared as a thin layer adjacent to the plasma membrane . Stimulation induced proliferation of the filamentous cytomatrix toward the synaptic vesicle cluster . We therefore suggest that actin filaments grow out from the endocytic zone during synaptic activity ( Fig . 6 ) . Although we did not determine the exact time course of filament proliferation , they were already detectable after 2 min of stimulation , suggesting that it is a rapid process . Synaptic vesicles were associated with the proliferated filaments in stimulated synapses both after NEM - S1 and phalloidin injection . In unstimulated synapses vesicles were not detected in this region ( 17 , 27 ) . These observations suggest that the synaptic vesicles detected lateral to the vesicle cluster represent recycled vesicles trapped during migration from the endocytic zone to the cluster . This possibility is supported by the observation of aggregates of synaptic vesicles adjacent to synaptic vesicle clusters after NEM - S1 injection . The close association between vesicles and actin filaments is suggestive of an actin - based mechanism of vesicle transport in the synapse . Such a mechanism could share features with the actin tails implicated in intracellular movement of different types of vesicles and infectious agents ( 7 , 8 , 35 , 36 ) . Both actin treadmilling and actin – myosin interactions may potentially be involved in this mech - anism of movement ( 36 ) . Recently , dynamin was shown to be present in actin tails at endocytic vesicles suggesting that these tails may be functionally coupled with the endocytic machinery ( 9 , 10 ) . The involvement of actin in synaptic vesicle recycling is most likely not restricted solely to vesicle transport . In experiments with C2 toxin and phalloidin we observed an inhibition of endocytosis and changes in the relative proportion of uncon - stricted clathrin - coated pits . These observations are consistent with the proposed role of actin at the constriction and (cid:2) or fission steps of endocytosis ( 2 , 5 , 6 ) . Our observations of actin filaments attached to the neck of coated pits and the presence of some coated pits with elongated necks could be related to such a function . We thank Dr .
