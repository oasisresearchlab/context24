A ﬁtter type generally has higher chances of disseminating their copies to other individuals . The ﬁxation probability of a single mutant type introduced in a population of wild - type individuals quantiﬁes how likely the mutant type spreads . How much the excess ﬁtness of the mutant type increases its ﬁxation probability , namely , the selection pressure , is important in assessing the impact of the introduced mutant . Previous studies mostly based on undirected and unweighted contact networks of individuals showed that the selection pressure depends on the struc - ture of networks and the rule of reproduction . Real networks underlying ecological and social interactions are usually directed or weighted . Here we examine how the selection pressure is modulated by directionality of interactions under several update rules . Our conclusions are twofold . First , directionality discounts the selection pressure for diﬀerent networks and update rules . Second , given a network , the update rules in which death events precede reproduction events signiﬁcantly decrease the selection pressure than the other rules . 2 1 Introduction In evolutionary dynamics , diﬀerent types of individuals compete for survival in a population . A type means genotype , social behavior , cultural trait , and so on , depending on the context . A type that is ﬁtter than others generally bears more oﬀsprings . A major quantity representing how successfully a type spreads in evolutionary dynamics is the ﬁxation probability ( Moran , 1958 ; Ewens , 2004 ; Lieberman et al . , 2005 ; Nowak , 2006 ) . In a simple case in which there are only two types , the ﬁxation probability of a type is the probability that a single individual of that mutant type introduced in a population of the other wild - type individuals eventually occupies the entire population . Requirements for considering the ﬁxation probability are that the evolutionary dynamics are stochastic and that the two unanimity states , that is , the one of the introduced type and the other of the wild type , are the only two absorbing states . The ﬁxation probability of a type depends on the ﬁtness of the type , connectivity of individuals , and the update rule of evolutionary dynamics ( Ewens , 2004 ; Lieberman et al . , 2005 ; Antal et al . , 2006 ; Nowak , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . Evolutionary dynamics , both ecological and social , pretty often occur on complex contact networks of individuals ( Newman , 2003 ; Watts , 2004 ; Keeling 2005 ; Proulx et al . , 2005 ; May , 2006 ) . Some networks as well as the rule of reproduction and other factors amplify the selection pressure in the sense that a ﬁtter type has a larger ﬁxation probability and a less ﬁt type has a smaller ﬁxation probability compared to a reference case of the all - to - all connected population ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ; Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . Other combinations of a network and an update rule may suppress evolutionary pressure , with the ﬁxation probability relatively insensitive to the ﬁtness of the mutant type . To quantify the extent to which a particular situation ampliﬁes or suppresses the selection pressure is important for assessing the impact of a mutant type . Studies of ﬁxation probability on networks and structured populations have been restricted to two neutral types ( Donnelly and Welsh , 1983 ; Taylor , 1990 ; Taylor , 1996 ) or undirected and 3 unweighted networks ( Maruyama , 1970 ; Slatkin , 1981 ; Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) , albeit a notable exception ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) . Regarding the directionality , undirected ( and unweighted ) networks may be natural for modeling social interaction such as games , where an adjacent pair of individuals , for example , is simultaneously involved in a single game to determine the ﬁtness of each individual . However , reproduction events given the ﬁtness of each individual may occur on directed or weighted networks . Indeed , relevant contacts in many real networks have directionality because of , for example , heterogeneity in the size of habitat patches ( Gustafson and Gardner , 1996 ) and geographical biases such as the wind direction ( Schooley and Wiens , 2003 ) and riverine streams ( Schick and Lindley , 2007 ) in ecological networks . Social networks based on glooming behavior of rhesus monkeys ( Sade , 1972 ) , email communication of humans ( Ebel et al . , 2002 ; Newman et al . , 2002 ) also have directionality . In the present work , we examine the evolutionary dynamics on diﬀerent undirected and directed networks , namely , the complete graph , the undirected cycle , the directed cycle , the weighted undirected star , undirected and directed random graphs , and undirected and directed scale - free ( SF ) networks . Motivated by previous studies ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Ohtsuki et al . , 2006 ; Ohtsuki and Nowak , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) , we examine the eﬀects of several update rules on the selection pressure . We show that asymmetric connectivity generally turns down the selection pressure and that speciﬁc update rules suppress the selection pressure more than other rules . 2 Model 2 . 1 Dynamics We consider a population of N haploid , asexually reproducing individuals . The structure of the population is described by a directed graph G . We denote by E the set of directed edges , implying that ( v i , v j ) ∈ E if and only if there is a directed edge from v i to v j . Each node v i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N ) is occupied by an individual of one type . Edges represent the likelihood with which the types are transferred from nodes to nodes in evolutionary dynamics . 4 We assume that there are two types A and B . A node is occupied by either type A or B . Types A ( mutant type ) and B ( wild type ) confer ﬁtness r and 1 to its bearer , respectively . Given graph G and an update rule , the collective network state , which is speciﬁed by an assignment of A or B to each node of the network , stochastically evolves . The dynamics last until the unanimity ( i . e . , ﬁxation ) of A or that of B is reached . We do not assume mutation so that these two collective states are the only absorbing states . We are concerned with the ﬁxation probability of type A denoted by F v ( r ) . It is the probability that a single type - A mutant introduced at node v in a sea of N − 1 resident type - B individuals ﬁxates . Type B ﬁxates with probability 1 − F v ( r ) . The ﬁxation probability depends on G , the update rule , and the initial location v of the A mutant . To focus on the eﬀect of G and the update rule , we examine F ( r ) = P v F v ( r ) / N . The eﬀect of the initial location of the mutant has been analyzed for undirected ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) and directed ( Masuda and Ohtsuki , 2009 ) networks . An update event occurs on one directed edge per unit time . We assume that the direction of reproduction is the same as the edge direction . We examine the following ﬁve update rules , most of which are motivated by past literature . For the sake of explanation , we explain the update rules for directed and unweighted networks . However , we can extend the model and the results to the case of weighted edges in a straightforward manner ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) ( also see related analysis in Sec . 4 . 4 ) . 2 . 2 BD - B update rule Under the birth – death rule with selection on the birth ( BD - B ) , we ﬁrst select one node v i for reproduction in each time step . The probability that v i is selected is proportional to the ﬁtness value , that is , f i / P l f l , where f i ∈ { r , 1 } is the ﬁtness of the type on v i . Note that selection operates on the birth . Then , the type at v i is propagated to a neighbor of v i along a directed edge that is chosen with probability 1 / k outi , where k outi is the outdegree of v i . The probability that directed edge ( v i , v j ) ∈ E is used for reproduction is equal to f i / k outi P l f l . 5 BD - B is the update rule considered in ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) . It is equivalent to the previously deﬁned birth – death rule for games on undirected networks ( Ohtsuki et al . , 2006 ; Ohtsuki and Nowak , 2006 ) and to the invasion process deﬁned in ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . 2 . 3 BD - D update rule Under the birth – death rule with selection on the death ( BD - D ) , a random individual v i is ﬁrst chosen for reproduction with equal probability 1 / N . Then , one of its neighbors v j that receives a directed edge from v i dies with probability proportional to 1 / f j , and the type at v i replaces that at v j . Selection operates on the death . The probability that edge ( v i , v j ) ∈ E is used for reproduction is equal to f − 1 j / N P l ; ( v i , v l ) ∈ E f − 1 l . When r = 1 , BD - B and BD - D are identical . 2 . 4 DB - B update rule Under the death – birth rule with selection on the birth ( DB - B ) , a random individual v j ﬁrst dies with equal probability 1 / N . Then , a neighbor of v j that sends a directed edge to v j , denoted by v i , is selected for reproduction with probability f i / P l ; ( v l , v j ) ∈ E f l , and the type of v i replaces that at v j . Selection operates on the birth . The probability that ( v i , v j ) ∈ E is used for reproduction is equal to f i / N P l ; ( v l , v j ) ∈ E f l . DB - B is equivalent to the score - dependent fertility model proposed in ( Nakamaru et al . , 1998 ) and to the death – birth rule previously used for evolutionary games on undirected networks ( Ohtsuki et al . , 2006 ; Ohtsuki and Nowak , 2006 ) . Many numerical studies of spatial reciprocity ( Nowak and May , 1992 ) and network reciprocity ( Santos and Pacheco , 2005 ) are also based on this update rule or similar rules . 2 . 5 DB - D update rule Under the death – birth rule with selection on the death ( DB - D ) , a node v j is ﬁrst chosen for death with probability f − 1 j / P l f − 1 l . Selection operates on the death . Next , a neighbor of v j that sends a directed edge to v j , denoted by v i , is chosen for reproduction randomly with 6 probability 1 / k inj , where k inj is the indegree of v j . Then , the type at v i replaces that at v j . The probability that ( v i , v j ) ∈ E is used for reproduction is equal to f − 1 j / k inj P l f − 1 l . This rule is equivalent to the score - dependent viability model proposed in ( Nakamaru et al . , 1997 ) and to the voter model deﬁned in ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . When r = 1 , DB - B and DB - D are identical . 2 . 6 LD update rule Under the link dynamics ( LD ) with selection on the birth ( resp . death ) , directed edge ( v i , v j ) ∈ E is chosen with probability f i / P ( v l , v l ′ ) ∈ E f l ( resp . f − 1 j / P ( v l ′ , v l ) ∈ E f − 1 l ) . The denominators in these probabilities indicate the summation over all the directed edges . Selection operates on the birth ( resp . death ) . Then , the type at v i replaces that at v j . When there are only two types , as assumed in this and most previous studies ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ; Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) , the LD with selection on the birth and that on the death coincide with each other , up to a change of the timescale . Then this rule is the same as the LD deﬁned in ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . 3 Evolutionary ampliﬁers and suppressors In this section , we explain the order parameter measured in the following analysis . We are concerned with dependence of selection pressure on networks and update rules . The ﬁxation probability at neutrality , namely , r = 1 , is equal to F ( 1 ) = 1 / N . A type with a larger ﬁtness is more likely to ﬁxate , that is , dF ( r ) / dr ≥ 0 . However , how F ( r ) depends on r diﬀers by the network and by the update rule . The reference proﬁle of F ( r ) is given by the Moran process ( Moran , 1958 ; Ewens , 2004 ; Nowak , 2006 ) . In the Moran process , we select an individual v i at each time step for reproduction with the probability proportional to f i . Then , the oﬀspring replaces an individual randomly picked from the rest of the population with the equal probability 1 / ( N − 1 ) . The evolutionary dynamics on the complete graph under BD - B is the Moran process . As explained in Appendix B , F ( r ) for the Moran process is equal to F ( r ) 7 for the complete graph under DB - D and LD as well as under BD - B , and it is given by 1 − r − 1 1 − r − N . ( 1 ) A network or an update rule that yields F ( r ) larger than Eq . ( 1 ) for r > 1 and smaller than Eq . ( 1 ) for r < 1 is called evolutionary ampliﬁer . For an evolutionary ampliﬁer , the selection pressure is magniﬁed relative to that of the Moran process ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) . If the ﬁxation probability is smaller than Eq . ( 1 ) for r > 1 and larger than Eq . ( 1 ) for r < 1 , the network or the update rule is called evolutionary suppressor . The ampliﬁcation factor K may be deﬁned when the ﬁxation probability is given in the form : 1 − r − 1 1 − r − KN . ( 2 ) If Eq . ( 2 ) holds for a graph with N nodes , the evolutionary dynamics are equivalent to the Moran process with the eﬀective population size KN . Because a larger population size results in stronger selection pressure for the Moran process , K > 1 and K < 1 correspond to evolutionary ampliﬁer and suppressor , respectively . For example , for a family of star graphs under BD - B ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) , and for undirected uncorrelated graphs under BD - B and DB - D ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) , F ( r ) obeys Eq . ( 2 ) with diﬀerent values of K in an appropriate limit . However , F ( r ) generally deviates from Eq . ( 2 ) . Therefore , in the numerical simulations in Sec . 5 , we calculate the ﬁxation probability at r = 4 and compare it with that of the Moran process . 4 Fixation probability for some simple graphs For some simple graphs , we calculate the ﬁxation probability for diﬀerent update rules to determine the selection pressure . The details of the calculations are shown in Appendix B . The results in this section are mostly restricted to undirected networks . We will treat the eﬀect of directionality numerically in Sec . 5 . 8 4 . 1 Complete graph Consider the evolutionary dynamics on the complete graph of N nodes depicted in Fig . 1 ( a ) . Self loops are excluded . The complete graph is undirected and regular , where a regular graph is one in which the indegree and the outdegree of all the nodes are the same . For undirected regular graphs , BD - B , DB - D , and LD are all equivalent to the Moran process with the same population size N ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , F ( r ) is given by Eq . ( 1 ) . For BD - D , we obtain F ( r ) = 1 1 + ( N − 1 ) P N − 1 m = 1 r − m + 1 m + r ( N − 1 − m ) . ( 3 ) For DB - B , we obtain F ( r ) = N − 1 N 1 − r − 1 1 − r − N + 1 . ( 4 ) In Fig . 2 ( a ) , F ( r ) for the Moran process , BD - D , and DB - B is compared for the complete graph with N = 10 . The three lines cross at neutrality , that is , ( r , F ( r ) ) = ( 1 , 1 / N ) . The complete graph is an evolutionary suppressor under BD - D , even though lim r →∞ F ( r ) = 1 and lim r → 0 F ( r ) = 0 . This is because selection occurs among the N − 1 nodes excluding the reproducing node . DB - B is a stronger suppressor than BD - D . Diﬀerently from BD - D , we obtain lim r →∞ F ( r ) = ( N − 1 ) / N and lim r → 0 F ( r ) = 0 for DB - B , so that a mutant may not ﬁx under DB - B even if its ﬁtness is inﬁnitely large . For the three diﬀerent cases , F ( 4 ) is plotted against N ( ≥ 2 ) in Fig . 2 ( b ) . The ﬁxation prob - ability for BD - D and DB - B converges to that for the Moran process as N → ∞ . Remarkably , for BD - D and DB - B , the existence of more competitors in the population , that is , larger N , leads to the higher ﬁxation probability of the single type - A mutant . As N increases , selection acts on more nodes relative to the population size ( i . e . , ( N − 1 ) / N ) under BD - D and DB - B . Then type - A nodes , which are rare in an early stage of dynamics , are involved in competition for survival ( under BD - D ) or reproduction ( under DB - B ) more often such that type A takes advantage of being inherently ﬁtter than type B . 9 4 . 2 Undirected cycle Consider the undirected cycle of size N depicted in Fig . 1 ( b ) . Because the undirected cycle is unweighted and regular , BD - B , DB - D , and LD are again equivalent to the Moran process , and F ( r ) is given by Eq . ( 1 ) . For BD - D , we obtain F ( r ) = 1 − r − 1 1 + r − 1 r ( r + 1 ) + ( r 2 − 2 r − 1 ) r − N + 1 r + 1 . ( 5 ) For DB - B , we obtain F ( r ) = 1 − r − 1 1 + r − 1 2 r + ( r − 3 ) r − N + 1 2 . ( 6 ) For the undirected cycle , F ( r ) with N = 10 and F ( 4 ) with N varied are shown in Fig . 2 ( c ) and Fig . 2 ( d ) , respectively . Qualitatively agreeing with the case of the complete graph , BD - D is suppressing , and DB - B is even more so . In contrast to the case of the complete graph , BD - D and DB - B persist to be suppressing for large N . Under BD - D and DB - B , selection operates on about h k i individuals , where h k i is the mean degree of the network , whereas selection operates on N individuals under BD - B , DB - D , and LD . For the complete graph , the diﬀerence diminishes as N → ∞ because h k i = N − 1 . For the undirected cycle , h k i = 2 independent of N , which is a likely reason why BD - D and DB - B are suppressing even for large N . 4 . 3 Directed cycle Consider the directed cycle of size N depicted in Fig . 1 ( c ) . It is straightforward to verify that the evolutionary dynamics under BD - B , DB - D , and LD are equivalent to the Moran process . For BD - D and DB - B , selection pressure is totally annihilated , that is , F ( r ) = 1 / N . 4 . 4 Star Consider the star with N nodes depicted in Fig . 1 ( d ) . One central hub is connected to the other N − 1 leaves . Only in this section , we introduce the edge weight for a computation purpose . Speciﬁcally , each edge outgoing from the hub has weight 1 , and each edge incoming to the hub 10 has weight a . The edge weight is assumed to be multiplied to the likelihood with which the edge is used for reproduction ( see Secs . 2 . 2 - 2 . 6 and Appendix B ) . The ﬁxation probability for the weighted star under LD is given by F ( r ) = 1 − N − 1 N r + a r ( ra + 1 ) − 1 N ra + 1 r ( r + a ) 1 − r − N (cid:0) r + a ra + 1 (cid:1) N − 2 . ( 7 ) For general a , we obtain in the limit N → ∞ K = − ln r + a r ( ra + 1 ) ln r , ( 8 ) where K is deﬁned by Eq . ( 2 ) . Although in an incomplete form of Eq . ( 8 ) , which includes r in the RHS , K > 1 ( K < 1 ) for all r 6 = 1 when a > 1 ( a < 1 ) . Therefore , the weighted star is an ampliﬁer ( a suppressor ) when a > 1 ( a < 1 ) . With a = 1 in Eq . ( 7 ) , F ( r ) is equal to Eq . ( 1 ) . This is expected because the evolutionary dynamics for any undirected network are equivalent to the Moran process under LD ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . As shown in Appendix B , LD on the weighted star with a = N − 1 is equivalent to BD - B on the unweighted star . Therefore , the unweighted star is an ampliﬁer under BD - B . Particularly , in the limit N → ∞ , Eq . ( 7 ) yields K = 2 , consistent with the previous result ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) . The theory for undirected uncorrelated networks ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) also predicts K = h k i h k − 1 i ≈ 2 for the undirected star under BD - B . Also shown in Appendix B is that LD on the weighted star with a = 1 / ( N − 1 ) is equivalent to DB - D on the unweighted star . Setting a = 1 / ( N − 1 ) in Eq . ( 8 ) yields K = 0 in the limit N → ∞ . This is consistent with the result for undirected uncorrelated networks : K = h k i 2 / h k 2 i = 2 / N ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . The ﬁxation probability for BD - D is given by F ( r ) = ( N − 1 ) N 1 + r ( N − 2 ) 2 + r ( N − 2 ) + 1 N 1 1 + 1 + r ( N − 1 ) r − 1 (cid:16) 1 − r − N + 2 N N − 1 + r (cid:17) , ( 9 ) and that for DB - B is given by F ( r ) = ( rN + N + 2 r − 2 ) ( rN − r + 1 ) N 2 ( N + 2 r − 2 ) ( r + 1 ) . ( 10 ) 11 For the unweighted star , F ( r ) with N = 10 and F ( 4 ) with N varied are shown in Fig . 2 ( e ) and Fig . 2 ( f ) , respectively . LD corresponds to the Moran process , and BD - B is the only amplifying update rule . Among the other three suppressing update rules , DB - B is the most suppressing . Figure 2 ( f ) indicates that BD - D is more suppressing than DB - B for small N and vice versa for large N . As N tends large , DB - B and DB - D become strongly suppressing . Indeed , both Eq . ( 7 ) with a = 1 / ( N − 1 ) representing DB - D and Eq . ( 10 ) representing DB - B yield F ( r ) = O ( 1 / N ) , r > 1 . In contrast , the ﬁxation probability for BD - D approaches that for the Moran process as N → ∞ ; Eq . ( 9 ) yields lim N →∞ F ( r ) = ( r − 1 ) / r , which agrees with the result for the Moran process derived from Eq . ( 1 ) . 5 Numerical results Here we report numerical results for the ﬁxation probability of the mutant type with r = 4 . Equation ( 1 ) implies lim N →∞ F ( r ) = 3 / 4 for the Moran process . If F ( 4 ) measured for a combination of a network and an update rule is larger ( smaller ) than 3 / 4 , that combination is probably amplifying ( suppressing ) . Whether the combination is amplifying or suppressing and to what extent actually depend on r . However , our extensive numerical results suggest that this dependence is not strong unless r is extremely small or large . The values of F ( 4 ) are also well correlated with dF ( r ) / dr | r = 1 , which is the sensitivity of the selection pressure at neutrality . Therefore , we assume r = 4 in the following . A graph G is called strongly connected if there is a directed path from an arbitrary chosen node to another . For G that is not strongly connected , the mutant type introduced at a node in a downstream component never ﬁxates , and the ﬁxation problem is ascribed to that for the most upstream strongly connected component of G ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , we assume that G is strongly connected without loss of generality . 12 5 . 1 Small networks In this section , we present numerical results for small networks . The evolutionary dynamics are interpreted as a discrete - time Markov chain on a ﬁnite space . A state of the Markov chain is speciﬁed by an assignment of type A or B to each node , so that there are 2 N possible states . Among them , the two states corresponding to the unanimity of A and that of B are the unique absorbing states . Given G and an update rule , we obtain the exact ﬁxation probability by solving a system of linear equations of 2 N − 2 variables ( see Appendix A for methods ) . Because of the computation time , we set N = 6 and calculate F ( 4 ) for all the 1047008 strongly connected networks under the ﬁve update rules . The results are qualitatively similar for N = 4 and N = 5 ( data not shown ) . To visualize the results and to correlate F ( 4 ) with the structure of G , we regard the values of F ( 4 ) for diﬀerent networks as diﬀerent data points . Then we regress F ( 4 ) of these data points against various measurements of the network , which we call order parameters . We look for the order parameters that are more correlated with F ( 4 ) than other order parameters . Our choice of the order parameters is arbitrary . For each of the ﬁve update rules , we list in Tab . 1 the Pearson correlation coeﬃcient between F ( 4 ) and the order parameters , where h·i denotes the average over the nodes . The ﬁrst order parameter is the mean degree h k i ≡ h k in i = h k out i , where k in and k out is the indegree and the outdegree of a node , respectively . Seven order parameters are normalized moments of the degree distribution : h k i h 1 / k in i , h k i h 1 / k out i , h k i 2 / D ( k in ) 2 E , h k i 2 / D ( k out ) 2 E , h k i 2 / h k in k out i , h k out / k in i , and h k in / k out i . The other two order parameters are the normalized standard deviation of the node temperature : std ( T in ) and std ( T out ) . The tem - perature T ini of node v i ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) is deﬁned by T ini ≡ P j ; ( v j , v i ) ∈ E ( w ji / P l w jl ) . We deﬁne std ( T in ) ≡ q P Ni = 1 ( T ini − h T in i ) 2 / N / h T in i = qP Ni = 1 ( T ini − 1 ) 2 / N , where we have used h T in i = 1 . For isothermal networks , which satisfy std ( T in ) = 0 , the evolutionary dynam - ics under BD - B are equivalent to the Moran process ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , we deﬁne the temperature for the outdegree by T outi ≡ P j ; ( v i , v j ) ∈ E ( w ij / P l w lj ) , which satisﬁes h T out i = 1 , and measure std ( T out ) . 13 Under BD - B , we have not found an order parameter that is strongly correlated with F ( 4 ) , as listed in Tab . 1 . For a visualization purpose , we plot F ( 4 ) against std ( T in ) for all the networks in Fig . 3 ( a ) . Each gray dot in the ﬁgure corresponds to a network of size N = 6 . Black circles are for undirected networks . The Moran process with N = 6 yields F ( 4 ) = 0 . 7502 , which is shown by the solid line . Because r = 4 > 1 , networks with F ( 4 ) above ( below ) the solid line are ampliﬁers ( suppressors ) . Figure 3 ( a ) suggests the following . First , the undirected star ( indicated by the arrow ) is by far the most amplifying among all the networks . Most networks that yield large F ( 4 ) are variants of the star and have large std ( T in ) . Second , all the undirected networks are ampliﬁers under BD - B , consistent with the result that F ( r ) for undirected uncorrelated networks is given by Eq . ( 2 ) with K = h k i h k − 1 i > 1 ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . Indeed , F ( 4 ) for undirected networks with N = 6 ( black circles ) are strongly correlated with h k i h k − 1 i ( data not shown ) . Third , a majority of directed networks is suppressor . The mean and the standard deviation of F ( 4 ) based on all the networks and those based on the undirected networks compared in Tab . 2 indicate a signiﬁcant diﬀerence . Under BD - D , h k i is most strongly correlated with F ( 4 ) . The values of F ( 4 ) for diﬀerent networks are plotted against h k i in Fig . 3 ( b ) . The complete graph , which corresponds to h k i = N − 1 = 5 , is the least suppressing , although it is nevertheless a suppressor , as shown in Sec . 4 . 1 . All the networks are suppressors . Table 2 indicates that the suppression is generally stronger under BD - D than under BD - B and that directed networks are stronger suppressors than undirected networks on an average . Under DB - B also , h k i is most strongly correlated with F ( 4 ) . Figure 3 ( c ) , which shows the relation between F ( 4 ) and h k i , indicates that the complete graph achieves the largest F ( 4 ) , that all the networks are suppressors , and that directed networks are more suppressing than undirected networks on an average . These tendencies are similar to those for BD - D . Under DB - D , std ( T out ) is most strongly correlated with F ( 4 ) . Equation ( 2 ) with K = h k i 2 / h k 2 i , which was derived for undirected uncorrelated networks ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) , approximates our numerical results for the undirected networks ( data not shown ) . 14 However , std ( T out ) seems to be a better predictor of F ( 4 ) than h k i 2 / D ( k in ) 2 E , h k i 2 / D ( k out ) 2 E , and h k i 2 / h k in k out i , probably because of the small network size . Figure 3 ( d ) indicates that F ( 4 ) for the networks with std ( T out ) = 0 is equal to F ( 4 ) for the Moran process , that all the other networks are suppressors , and that directed networks are more suppressing than undirected networks on average . Under LD , h k in / k out i is most strongly correlated with F ( 4 ) . Evolutionary dynamics for undirected networks are equivalent to the Moran process ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . Figure 3 ( e ) indicates that directed networks are generally more suppressing than undirected networks , that there are both ampliﬁers and suppressors among directed networks with the majority being suppressors , and that smaller h k in / k out i tends to yield larger F ( 4 ) . The network that achieves the largest F ( 4 ) is shown in Fig . 4 . Most networks that pro - duce large F ( 4 ) are variants of this network . Because P Ni = 1 k ini = P Ni = 1 k outi , a small value of h k in / k out i requires that k in < k out holds for many small - degree nodes and that k in > k out holds for a relatively small number of hubs . The network shown in Fig . 4 complies with this property . In Fig . 4 , each of the two hubs links to the half of the peripheral nodes , whereas each peripheral node links to both hubs . If we merge the two hubs into one as an approximation , the network is regarded as a weighted star with a = 2 ( Fig . 1 ( d ) ) . The weighted star with a = 2 is indeed an ampliﬁer , as shown in Sec . 4 . 4 . Based on the numerical results for the ﬁve update rules , we claim the following . First , directed networks tend to be suppressors compared to undirected networks regardless of the update rule . Second , some update rules ( i . e . , BD - D , DB - B , and DB - D ) are much more sup - pressing than the others ( i . e . , BD - B and LD ) . Particularly , the magnitude of the ampliﬁcation is ordered as : BD - B > LD > DB - D > BD - D > DB - B ( Tab . 2 ) , which is consistent with the one for the undirected star with small N ( Fig . 2 ( f ) ) . In a single time step , the selection pressure operates on N nodes for BD - B , DB - D , and LD . However , it operates on at most N − 1 nodes for BD - D and DB - B , because the node ﬁrst selected for reproduction under BD - D or for death under DB - B does not participate in the competition . This is a main reason why BD - D and 15 DB - B are strongly suppressing . We will corroborate these points by numerical simulations of large networks in Sec . 5 . 2 . 5 . 2 Large networks Because of the computational cost , the exact numerical analysis performed in Sec . 5 . 1 is feasible only for small networks . In this section , we examine evolutionary dynamics on larger networks by Monte Carlo simulations . We use the Erd¨os – R´enyi ( ER ) random graph , SF networks , and their directed versions of diﬀerent sizes ( e . g . Albert and Barab´asi , 2002 ; Newman , 2003 ) . We generate the undirected ER graph of mean degree h k i by connecting each pair of nodes with probability h k i / ( N − 1 ) . The directed ER graph is generated by connecting each ordered pair of nodes with probability 2 h k i / ( N − 1 ) so that h k in i = h k out i = h k i . In both cases , the degree distribution p ( k ) follows a poisson distribution with mean h k i : p ( k ) ≈ e − k / h k i / h k i . For SF networks , we assume p ( k ) ∝ k − 3 , ( h k i / 2 ≤ k ) , where the power - law exponent 3 is an arbitrary choice . The SF network represents the situation in which the degree is strongly heterogeneous ( Albert and Barab´asi , 2002 ; Newman , 2003 ) . To generate a SF network , we ﬁrst determine the degree of each node stochastically according to the power - law distribution p ( k ) with the restriction that the sum of the degree is even . Then , we randomly add edges one by one so that the predetermined degrees are respected at each node ( Albert and Barab´asi , 2002 ; Newman , 2003 ) . For undirected and directed SF networks , the added edges are undirected and directed , respectively . In each of the four network models , we discard networks that are not strongly connected . To calculate F ( 4 ) , we perform 2000 runs for each initial location of the type A individual and count the fraction of the 2000 N runs in which the unanimity of type A is reached . This is a Monte Carlo realization of the ﬁxation probability . For a ﬁxed N , h k i , network model , and update rule , we calculate the average and the standard deviation of F ( 4 ) based on 20 samples of networks . For h k i = 10 , F ( 4 ) under BD - B is plotted against N for the ER and SF networks in Figs . 5 ( a ) 16 and ( b ) , respectively . The standard deviation is shown by the error bars . The SF networks are more amplifying than the ER networks , consistent with the previous results ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ; Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , undirected networks ( solid lines ) are more amplifying than directed networks ( dashed lines ) , even for large N . The same tendencies are found for BD - D ( Figs . 5 ( c ) and ( d ) ) , DB - B ( Figs . 5 ( e ) and ( f ) ) , DB - D ( Figs . 5 ( g ) and ( h ) ) , and LD ( Figs . 5 ( i ) and ( j ) ) . This is a strong indication that directionality of edges generally suppresses the selection pressure . For each of the four types of networks used in Fig . 5 , the strength of the selection pressure is ordered as : BD - B > BD - D , LD > DB - D > DB - B . This order is consistent with the one for the unweighted star with large N ( Fig . 2 ( f ) ) . Compared to the results for the small networks shown in Sec . 5 . 1 , BD - D is much less suppressing in large networks , as shown in Figs . 5 ( c ) and ( d ) . This is a bit surprising because we have kept h k i = 10 in Fig . 5 so that the competition for survival happens among roughly h k i ≪ N nodes per unit time . In contrast , DB - B remains strongly suppressing even for large N ( Figs . 5 ( e ) and ( f ) ) . An increase in h k i with N ﬁxed makes DB - B less suppressing , as shown in Fig . 6 . This is consistent with the behavior of the ensemble of the small networks ( Fig . 3 ( c ) ) . 6 A theoretical explanation of the eﬀect of directionality The ﬁnding that the directionality of the network suppresses the selection pressure can be explained for LD on a simple network . Consider a bidirectionally but asymmetrically connected two - node network . Edge ( v 1 , v 2 ) ( from v 1 to v 2 ) has weight unity , and edge ( v 2 , v 1 ) has weight a . Even though we have formulated the evolutionary dynamics on unweighted networks , the extension to the case of weighted networks is straightforward ( also refer to the analysis of the weighted star in Appendix B ) . By enumerating the possible reproduction events per unit time , 17 we obtain F ( AB ) = rF ( AA ) + aF ( BB ) r + a = r r + a , ( 11 ) F ( BA ) = raF ( AA ) + F ( BB ) ra + 1 = ra ra + 1 , ( 12 ) where the ﬁrst and the second arguments of F are the types at v 1 and v 2 , respectively , and F is the ﬁxation probability starting from that network state . Note that F ( AA ) = 1 and F ( BB ) = 0 . Using Eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) , we obtain F ( r ) = F ( AB ) + F ( BA ) 2 = 1 2 (cid:18) r r + a + ra ra + 1 (cid:19) . ( 13 ) For r > 1 , F ( r ) as a function of a takes the maximum at a = 1 . For r < 1 , F ( r ) takes the minimum at a = 1 . Therefore , the unweighted network ( i . e . , a = 1 ) is the most amplifying when we vary a . LD on this unweighted network ( i . e . , a = 1 ) is equivalent to the Moran process with N = 2 . Accordingly , weighted networks ( i . e . , a 6 = 1 ) are suppressors , and the suppression is stronger as a deviates from unity . The applicability of the arguments above is beyond the two - node network . Suppose that a network is divided into two modules with homogeneous intramodular connectivity and that intermodular connectivity is sparse and homogeneous , possibly with more edges from one mod - ule to the other than the converse . Then the ﬁxation probability of a mutant on a particular node will depend only on the module in which the initial mutant invades . In this case , we can approximate the network by the two - node weighted network , where the edge weights between the two aggregated nodes represent the gross connectivity between the two modules . 7 Discussion Motivated by the observation that many real ecological and social networks underlying repro - duction in evolutionary dynamics are directed or weighted , we have investigated the ﬁxation probability on networks with directed edges under ﬁve update rules . For undirected networks , selection pressure relies on the network and the update rule , which reproduces the previous 18 results ( Lieberman et al . , 2005 ; Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . Our main conclusions in the present paper are twofold . First , directionality of edges suppresses the selection pressure for all the network types and the update rules that we have dealt with . We have presented numerical evidence for diﬀerent sizes of networks ( Sec . 5 ) and simple analytical arguments ( Sec . 6 ) to support this claim . Note that many ecological and social situations in which evolutionary dynamics take place can be modeled as directed or weighted networks rather than undirected and unweighted networks . Spreads of a type from one habitat to another may be easier than in the other direction because of heterogeneity in habitats and other geographical factors ( see Sec . 1 for references ) . Accordingly , ﬁxation in real contact networks may be less controlled by the values of ﬁtness than in the corresponding undirected networks or well - mixed populations . Second , the strength of the selection pressure depends on the update rule for various net - works , no matter whether edges are directed or not ( Secs . 4 and 5 ) . This conclusion extends the previous ﬁndings ( Antal et al . , 2006 ; Sood et al . , 2008 ) . For BD - D , DB - B , and DB - D , no evo - lutionary ampliﬁer has been found by our exhaustive numerical analysis for small N ( Sec . 5 . 1 ) . Moreover , DB - B is strongly suppressing compared to the other update rules . In evolutionary game theory , DB - B ( Nakamaru et al . , 1998 ; Ohtsuki et al . , 2006 ; Ohtsuki and Nowak , 2006 ) and its variants ( Nowak and May , 1992 ; Santos and Pacheco , 2005 ) have commonly been used . In games , the ﬁtness of a type is not constant , as assumed in the present paper , but depends on neighbors’ types . Therefore , the results obtained in this work are not immediately applicable to evolutionary games . However , these previous results on evolutionary games might considerably change under update rules less suppressing than DB - B , as has been argued ( Nakamaru et al . , 1998 ; Ohtsuki et al . , 2006 ; Ohtsuki and Nowak , 2006 ) . We have treated directed but unweighted networks for the sake of clarity of the analysis . However , we believe that our conclusions for directed networks extend to the case of weighted networks . This is partly supported by the analysis of the two - node weighted network presented in Sec . 6 . In addition , if we quantize the edge weight and allow multiple directed edges between 19 two nodes , a weighted network can be regarded as a directed unweighted network . A unique point in our analysis is the use of very small networks with N = 6 . Small networks per se appear in many ecological contexts . For example , the number of relevant habitats may not be very large ( Gustafson and Gardner , 1996 ; Tischendorf and Fahrig , 2000 ; Schick and Lindley , 2007 ) . In addition , small directed networks are likely to be structural and functional building blocks of large networks ( Milo et al . , 2002 ; Itzkovitz et al . , 2003 ) . According to the present analysis , the eﬀect of the directionality of edges and that of the update rule are mostly consistent between small and large networks . We believe that the conclusions of the present paper apply to real evolutionary dynamics in populations of various scales . Acknowledgments N . M thanks Hisashi Ohtsuki for valuable discussions . N .

Appendix A : Numerical procedure for small networks Here , we explain the methods for exactly calculating the ﬁxation probability for strongly con - nected networks . Because each node takes either type A or B , there are 2 N possible states of the evolutionary dynamics . We deﬁne the ﬁxation probability for a state , which may have multiple type - A nodes , by the probability that type A ﬁxates starting from that state . The ﬁxation probability for the all - A state is 1 , and that for the all - B state is 0 . Given a network , an update rule , and r , the evolutionary dynamics are equivalent to a nearest - neighbor random walk on the N - dimensional hypercube comprising 2 N points . In each time step , the type at a node replaces the type at one of its neighbors in the original evolutionary dynamics . Therefore , at most one node ﬂips its type per unit time . In terms of the random walk on the hypercube , the walker moves to a neighboring state or does not move . The random walk continues until either the all - A state or the all - B state is reached . 20 Consider an example network shown in Fig . 7 . Denote the ﬁxation probability for the state shown in Fig . 7 by F ( BAB ) , where the ﬁrst , second , and the third arguments ( A or B ) correspond to the types at v 1 , v 2 , and v 3 , respectively . In a unit time , state BAB may change to AAB , BBB , or BAA . Otherwise , it does not change . Under BD - B , for example , the ﬁxation probability satisﬁes F ( BAB ) = 1 r + 2 F ( BBB ) + F ( BAB ) 2 + r r + 2 F ( AAB ) + F ( BAA ) 2 + 1 r + 2 F ( BBB ) . ( 14 ) The ﬁrst , second , and third terms in the RHS of Eq . ( 14 ) represent the propagation of the type at v 1 , v 2 , and v 3 to its neighbor , respectively . Noting the boundary conditions F ( BBB ) = 0 and F ( AAA ) = 1 , we can write down the other ﬁve linear equations corresponding to the single - step transition of F ( ABB ) , F ( BBA ) , F ( AAB ) , F ( ABA ) , and F ( BAA ) . The ﬁxation probabilities are obtained by solving the system of the six linear equations . The ﬁxation probability starting from a single type - A node is given by F ( r ) = [ F ( ABB ) + F ( BAB ) + F ( BBA ) ] / 3 . Generally speaking , the ﬁxation probability for an N - node network is obtained by solving a system of 2 N − 2 linear equations . A standard method such as the Gauss elimination requires O (cid:16)(cid:0) 2 N (cid:1) 3 (cid:17) time of computation . For small N , we can enumerate all the possible networks ( Milo et al . , 2002 ; Itzkovitz et al . , 2003 ) . There are 1047008 strongly connected directed networks out of 1530843 weakly connected directed networks with N = 6 . We cannot solve the ﬁxation probability for N > 6 due to the computational cost of enumerating the directed networks , but not due to the cost of solving systems of 2 N − 2 linear equations . Appendix B : Fixation probability for simple graphs In this appendix , we show detailed calculations of the ﬁxation probability for simple graphs . Following a standard procedure , we map the evolutionary dynamics onto the discrete - time nearest - neighbor random walk on interval { 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . , N } . The position on the interval corre - sponds to the number of type - A individuals in a network of size N . Positions 0 and N are the 21 only absorbing states . The type - A individuals increase or decrease at most by one per unit time . The probability F m that the walker at position m eventually reaches position N satisﬁes the following relations : F 0 = 0 , ( 15 ) F m = α m F m + 1 + ( 1 − α m − β m ) F m + β m F m − 1 , ( 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 1 ) ( 16 ) F N = 1 , ( 17 ) for some α m and β m ( 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 1 ) . Then , the ﬁxation probability for a single mutant is represented by ( Moran , 1958 ; Ewens , 2004 ; Nowak , 2006 ) : F 1 = 1 1 + P N − 1 m = 1 Q mm ′ = 1 β m ′ α m ′ . ( 18 ) Complete graph Consider the complete graph with N nodes . The evolutionary dynamics under BD - B are equivalent to the Moran process , and Eq . ( 16 ) becomes F m = mr ( N − m ) F m + 1 + ( m − 1 ) F m N − 1 + ( N − m ) ( N − m − 1 ) F m + mF m − 1 N − 1 mr + N − m . ( 19 ) Therefore , α m = mr ( N − m ) / [ ( mr + N − m ) ( N − 1 ) ] , β m = m ( N − m ) / [ ( mr + N − m ) ( N − 1 ) ] , and β m / α m = 1 / r , which plugged into Eq . ( 18 ) leads to Eq . ( 1 ) . DB - D and LD also yield β m / α m = 1 / r and hence the same result as that for BD - B . For BD - D , we obtain F m = m N ( N − m ) F m + 1 + m − 1 r F m m − 1 r + N − m + N − m N ( N − 1 − m ) F m + mr F m − 1 mr + N − 1 − m . ( 20 ) Therefore , β m α m = m − 1 + r ( N − m ) r [ m + r ( N − 1 − m ) ] . ( 21 ) Plugging Eq . ( 21 ) into Eq . ( 18 ) leads to Eq . ( 3 ) . 22 For DB - B , we obtain F m = m N r ( m − 1 ) F m + ( N − m ) F m − 1 r ( m − 1 ) + N − m + N − m N rmF m + 1 + ( N − 1 − m ) F m rm + N − 1 − m . ( 22 ) Therefore , β m α m = rm + N − 1 − m r [ r ( m − 1 ) + N − m ] . ( 23 ) Plugging Eq . ( 23 ) into Eq . ( 18 ) leads to Eq . ( 4 ) . Undirected cycle Consider the undirected cycle with N nodes . Under BD - D , we obtain F 1 = 1 N F 2 + 2 N F 1 + F 0 r 1 + 1 r + N − 3 N F 1 , ( 24 ) F m = 2 N F m + 1 + F m r 1 + 1 r + 2 N F m + F m − 1 r 1 + 1 r + N − 4 N F m , ( 2 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) ( 25 ) F N − 1 = 2 N F N + F N − 1 r 1 + 1 r + 1 N F N − 2 + N − 3 N F N − 1 . ( 26 ) Therefore , β m α m =   2 r + 1 , ( m = 1 ) 1 r , ( 2 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) r + 1 2 r . ( m = N − 1 ) ( 27 ) Plugging Eq . ( 27 ) into Eq . ( 18 ) leads to Eq . ( 5 ) . Under DB - B , we obtain F 1 = 2 N rF 2 + F 1 r + 1 + 1 N F 0 + N − 3 N F 1 , ( 28 ) F m = 2 N rF m + 1 + F m r + 1 + 2 N rF m + F m − 1 r + 1 + N − 4 N F m , ( 2 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) ( 29 ) F N − 1 = 1 N F N + 2 N rF N − 1 + F N − 2 r + 1 + N − 3 N F N − 1 . ( 30 ) Therefore , β m α m =   r + 1 2 r , ( m = 1 ) 1 r , ( 2 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) 2 r + 1 . ( m = N − 1 ) ( 31 ) Plugging Eq . ( 31 ) into Eq . ( 18 ) leads to Eq . ( 6 ) . 23 Star Consider the undirected star with N nodes . To calculate the ﬁxation probability for BD - B and LD simultaneously , it is convenient to introduce the edge weight . We assume that an edge from the hub to a leaf is endowed with weight unity and one from a leaf to the hub is endowed with weight a ( Fig . 1 ( d ) ) . The edge weight works as a multiplicative factor to the probability that this edge is chosen for reproduction , which is explained in Sec . 2 . Denote by F m , A ( F m , B ) ( 0 ≤ m ≤ N − 1 ) the ﬁxation probability of type A when there are m type - A leaves and the hub is occupied by type A ( B ) . BD - B for the unweighted star is equivalent to LD with selection on the birth , which is actually the ordinary LD , for the weighted star with a = N − 1 . DB - D for the unweighted star is equivalent to LD with selection on the death , which is again the ordinary LD , for the weighted star with a = 1 / ( N − 1 ) . Therefore , we calculate the ﬁxation probability for the weighted star under LD . Interpreting LD as the LD with selection on the birth , we obtain F m , A = rmaF m , A + ( N − 1 − m ) aF m , B + rmF m , A + r ( N − 1 − m ) F m + 1 , A rma + ( N − 1 − m ) a + r ( N − 1 ) , ( 32 ) ( 0 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) F m , B = rmaF m , A + ( N − 1 − m ) aF m , B + mF m − 1 , B + ( N − 1 − m ) F m , B rma + ( N − 1 − m ) a + ( N − 1 ) . ( 33 ) ( 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 1 ) Eqs . ( 32 ) and ( 33 ) , respectively , lead to ( r + a ) F m , A = aF m , B + rF m + 1 , A , ( 0 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) ( 34 ) ( ra + 1 ) F m , B = raF m , A + F m − 1 , B . ( 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 1 ) ( 35 ) By combining Eqs . ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) , we obtain ( r 2 a + 2 r + a ) F m , A − r ( ra + 1 ) F m + 1 , A − ( r + a ) F m − 1 , A = 0 . ( 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) ( 36 ) The solution to Eq . ( 36 ) that satisﬁes ( r + a ) F 0 , A = rF 1 , A , which comes from Eq . ( 34 ) with 24 m = 0 and F 0 , B = 0 , and F N − 1 , A = 1 is F m , A = r ( r + a ) ra + 1 − (cid:16) r + a r ( ra + 1 ) (cid:17) m r ( r + a ) ra + 1 − (cid:16) r + a r ( ra + 1 ) (cid:17) N − 1 . ( 37 ) Plugging Eq . ( 37 ) into Eq . ( 34 ) leads to F m , B = r ( r + a ) ra + 1 h 1 − (cid:16) r + a r ( ra + 1 ) (cid:17) m i r ( r + a ) ra + 1 − (cid:16) r + a r ( ra + 1 ) (cid:17) N − 1 . ( 38 ) The ﬁxation probability for a single mutant is represented by F ( r ) = ( N − 1 ) F 1 , B + F 0 , A N = 1 − N − 1 N r + a r ( ra + 1 ) − 1 N ra + 1 r ( r + a ) 1 − r − N (cid:0) r + a ra + 1 (cid:1) N − 2 . ( 39 ) For BD - D on the unweighted star , we obtain F m , A = mr mr + N − 1 − m F m , A + N − 1 − m mr + N − 1 − m F m + 1 , A + mF m , A + ( N − 1 − m ) F m , B N , ( 40 ) ( 0 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) F m , B = mr mr + N − 1 − m F m − 1 , B + N − 1 − m mr + N − 1 − m F m , B + mF m , A + ( N − 1 − m ) F m , B N . ( 41 ) ( 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 1 ) Equations ( 40 ) and ( 41 ) , respectively , lead to [ r ( N − m ) + m ] F m , A = [ m + r ( N − 1 − m ) ] F m , B + rF m + 1 , A , ( 42 ) ( 0 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) [ m + 1 + r ( N − 1 − m ) ] F m , B = [ m + r ( N − 1 − m ) ] F m , A + F m − 1 , B . ( 43 ) ( 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 1 ) By combining Eqs .

( 45 ) By substituting F 1 , A = NF 0 , A , which is derived by setting m = 0 in Eq . ( 42 ) , and F N − 1 , A = 1 into Eq .

( 43 ) and using F 0 , B = 0 , we derive F 1 , B = [ 1 + r ( N − 2 ) ] N 2 + r ( N − 2 ) F 0 , A . ( 47 ) Therefore , the ﬁxation probability F ( r ) = [ ( N − 1 ) F 1 , B + F 0 , A ] / N is given by Eq . ( 9 ) . For DB - B on the unweighted star , we obtain F m , A = mF m , A + ( N − 1 − m ) F m + 1 , A + rmF m , A + ( N − 1 − m ) F m , B rm + N − 1 − m N , ( 48 ) ( 0 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) F m , B = mF m − 1 , B + ( N − 1 − m ) F m , B + rmF m , A + ( N − 1 − m ) F m , B rm + N − 1 − m N . ( 49 ) ( 1 ≤ m ≤ N − 1 ) 26 Eqs . ( 48 ) and ( 49 ) , respectively , lead to ( rm + N − m ) F m , A = F m , B + ( rm + N − 1 − m ) F m + 1 , A , ( 50 ) ( 0 ≤ m ≤ N − 2 ) [ r ( m + 1 ) + N − 1 − m ] F m , B = rF m , A + ( rm + N − 1 − m ) F m − 1 , B .
