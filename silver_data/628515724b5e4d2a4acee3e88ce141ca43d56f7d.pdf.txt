We ﬁ nd that the sphingolipid pathway gene ISC1 , the product of which catalyzes the generation of bioactive ceramides from complex sphingolipids , plays a novel role in determining cellular morphology following HU / MMS treatment . HU - treated isc1 D cells display morphological aberrations , cell - wall defects , and defects in actin depolymerization . Swe1 , a morphogenesis checkpoint regulator , and the cell cycle regulator Cdk1 play key roles in these morphological defects of isc1 D cells . A genetic approach reveals that ISC1 interacts with other checkpoint proteins to control cell morphology . That is , yeast carrying deletions of both ISC1 and a replication checkpoint mediator gene including MRC1 , TOF1 , or CSM3 display basal morphological defects , which increase following HU treatment . Interestingly , strains with deletions of both ISC1 and the DNA damage checkpoint mediator gene RAD9 display reduced morphological aberrations irrespective of HU treatment , suggesting a role for RAD9 in determining the morphology of isc1 D cells . Mechanistically , the checkpoint regulator Rad53 partially in ﬂ uences isc1 D cell morphology in a dosage - dependent manner . T HE baker ’ s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is dimorphic , existing in budding or pseudohyphal form , depending on its environment . In response to environmental cues such as nitrogen starvation or the presence of short - chain alco - hols , diploid and certain haploid strains of yeast undergo morphological differentiation from budding to pseudohy - phal forms ( Gimeno et al . 1992 ; Lorenz et al . 2000 ; Lew 2003 ; Bharucha et al . 2008 ) . MAPK and cAMP pathways are important in inducing such pseudohyphal growth in re - sponse to these environmental cues ( Liu et al . 1993 ; Roberts and Fink 1994 ; Ward et al . 1995 ; Lengeler et al . 2000 ; Lorenz et al . 2000 ; Pan et al . 2000 ; Pan and Heitman 2002 ; Bharucha et al . 2008 ) . A morphogenesis checkpoint allows the cell to monitor defects in bud morphology , actin cytoskeleton perturbations , and cell - wall synthesis ( Lew and Reed 1995 ) through its key regulator , Swe1 protein kinase ( Lee et al . 2005 ; Keaton et al . 2007 ) . Swe1 phosphorylates and inactivates Cdk1 at Tyr19 to cause cell cycle delay and to control morphogenetic irreg - ularities . Swe1 accumulation is initiated in early S phase and its degradation must occur at the end of the G2 phase for the G2 / M transition to occur ( Sia et al . 1998 ; Lee et al . 2005 ) . Persistence of Swe1 causes prolonged inhibition of Cdk1 , which , in turn , can induce pseudohyphal growth ( Pruyne and Bretscher 2000a , b ) . Exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ) or methyl methanesulfo - nate ( MMS ) , both of which slow DNA synthesis , has been shown to induce minor morphological aberrations in yeast , speci ﬁ cally semi ﬁ lamentous growth in certain wild - type strains ( Jiang and Kang 2003 ) , although most haploid wild - type strains tested undergo no morphological changes after HU exposure ( Enserink et al . 2006 ) . Both HU and MMS impede progression of DNA replication machinery , slow S - phase progression , and can induce DNA damage ( Tercero and Dif ﬂ ey 2001 ; Katou et al . 2003 ; Zegerman and Dif ﬂ ey 2003 ) .

Furthermore , recent studies have shown that checkpoint proteins also play a role in morphogenesis in S . cerevisiae and Candida albicans ( Jiang and Kang 2003 ; Enserink et al . 2006 ; Smolka et al . 2006 ; Shi et al . 2007 ) in addition to their role in cell cycle arrest and DNA repair ( Wang 2009 ) . Many genes are involved in DNA damage checkpoint activity and morphogenesis , only some of which have been identi ﬁ ed . In S . cerevisiae , DNA damage is identi ﬁ ed by sen - sor proteins Mec1 and Tel1 , which signal through the me - diator Rad9 to downstream effectors Rad53 and Chk1 ( Putnam et al . 2009 ) . Three important components of the DNA replication machinery — Mrc1 , Tof1 , and Csm3 — act as the replication checkpoint mediators in the place of Rad9 ( Alcasabas et al . 2001 ; Katou et al . 2003 ; Bando et al . 2009 ) . These mediators appear to function differently during nor - mal DNA replication from when they are activated as part of a checkpoint ( Katou et al . 2003 ; Calzada et al . 2005 ; Szyjka et al . 2005 ; Tourriere et al . 2005 ; Mohanty et al . 2006 ; Bando et al . 2009 ; Tanaka et al . 2009 ) . Genome - wide stud - ies reveal that , in addition to genes controlling cell cycle checkpoints , genes from other pathways such as amino acid , carbohydrate , and lipid metabolism also contribute to HU and MMS resistance ( Chang et al . 2002 ; Hanway et al . 2002 ; Parsons et al . 2004 ) . Genes in the sphingolipid pathway have been found to confer resistance to HU and MMS ( Chang et al . 2002 ; Hanway et al . 2002 ) . Sphingolipids not only have major structural roles in the cell , but also are important bioactive molecules involved in signaling ( Futerman and Riezman 2005 ; Riezman 2006 ; Mil - has et al . 2009 ) . Isc1 is the sole inositol phosphosphingolipid - phospholipase C protein identi ﬁ ed in yeast that converts complex sphingolipids to ceramides ; it is the ortholog of the mammalian neutral sphingomyelinases ( Sawai et al . 2000 ; Matmati and Hannun 2008 ) . Deletion of ISC1 in yeast causes sensitivity to HU and MMS and G2 / M arrest ( Matmati et al . 2009 ) . HU - mediated G2 / M block of isc1 D cells can be rescued by deleting the SWE1 gene or by expressing a non - phosphorylatable Tyr - 19 mutant of Cdk1 ( Matmati et al . 2009 ) . We report that deletion of the ISC1 gene leads to mor - phological aberrations in S . cerevisiae cells upon exposure to various agents such as HU , MMS , galactose , or butanol . Morphological defects occurring after treatment with HU , galactose , or butanol are associated with stabilization of the morphogenesis checkpoint regulator Swe1 ; deletion of the SWE1 gene abolishes defects under all stress conditions tested . The aberrations induced upon replication stress by HU are associated with modi ﬁ cation of the actin cytoskele - ton and cell wall . Deletion of the replication checkpoint mediator genes MRC1 , TOF1 , or CSM3 does not reduce mor - phological defects signi ﬁ cantly in isc1 D cells after HU treat - ment ; instead , these cells have morphological irregularities and cell - wall defects under unperturbed conditions . In con - trast , deletion of RAD9 in isc1 D cells reduces morphological Table 1 Strains and plasmids Strains Genotype Reference Jk9 - 3d a MAT a trp1 leu2 - 3 his4 ura3 ade2 rme1 Matmati et al .

Finally , checkpoint effector Rad53 plays an important role in morphological defects of isc1 D cells under HU stress . Such results indicate the importance of a sphingolipid gene in the control of cellular morphogen - esis under various stress conditions . Materials and Methods Strains and plasmids All strains and plasmids are listed in Table 1 . Gene deletions were produced using G418 and phleomycin cassettes ( Longtine et al . 1998 ; Gueldener et al . 2002 ) . Construction of double - deletion strains in isc1 D background Plasmid pRS416 - ISC1 containing the ISC1 gene , including its endogenous promoter ( Vaena De Avalos et al . 2004 ) , was transformed into the isc1 D derivative of Jk9 - 3d a . The CSM3 , TOF1 , MRC1 , or RAD9 gene was then deleted from this strain using a phleomycin cassette . To subsequently se - lect for loss of pRS416 - ISC1 , cells were grown in SD / Ura 2 media followed by growth in YPD media , and cells were plated on SC plates containing 5 - FOA . Microscopy Live cells grown in rich or minimal media were visualized under a Nikon Eclipse ( TE2000 - 5 ) microscope with · 400 magni ﬁ cation . For all other purposes , cells were ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde , washed with phosphate buffer ( 50 mM , pH 7 ) , and suspended in phosphate buffer . Formaldehyde - ﬁ xed cells were stained with calco ﬂ uor white ( CFW ; Sigma ) at a ﬁ nal concentration of 50 m g / ml and visualized by · 1000 magni ﬁ cation at excitation and emission wavelength of 350 and 550 nm , respectively . For visualization of the actin cy - toskeleton , ﬁ xed cells were stained with rhodamine – phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions and visualized by · 1000 magni ﬁ cation at excitation and emission wavelengths of 525 – 545 and 565 nm , respectively . For visual - ization of nuclei , cells were stained with DAPI ( Vectashield ) and examined by · 1000 magni ﬁ cation at excitation and emis - sion wavelengths of 355 and 455 / 525 nm , respectively . Analysis of morphological aberrations Overnight cultures were inoculated into fresh YPD at 1 : 20 dilution and grown at 30 (cid:2) to an A 600 of 0 . 4 , when agents were added to the following ﬁ nal concentrations : 12 . 5 – 200 mM HU ( Sigma ) , 0 . 033 % v / v MMS ( Sigma ) , 1 % v / v 1 - butanol , or 2 . 0 % D - galactose ( Sigma ) . For galactose experi - ments , log - phase cells were pelleted , washed with medium containing yeast extract and peptone ( without glucose ) , and grown in yeast extract – peptone – galactose medium . Cells containing pRS315 or pCla6 were grown overnight in SD / Leu 2 medium , inoculated into fresh SD / Leu 2 medium , and grown to an A 600 of 0 . 2 when HU was added to 12 . 5 or 25 mM . Cells were collected at 5 and 22 hr after HU / MMS exposure or after 17 hr of butanol and galactose exposure , ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde , and washed with phosphate buffer before visualization . A bud was considered elongated if its length was more than two times its width ( Enserink et al . 2006 ) . The percentage of elongated buds or cells with abnormal morphology was calculated from large - budded populations only ; populations containing only unbudded and small - budded cells were not considered . Growth rates Overnight cultures were inoculated in fresh YPD to an A 600 of 0 . 2 , and absorbance ( A 600 ) was measured at 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 hr growth at 30 (cid:2) . Cells containing pRS315 or pCla6 were grown in SD / Leu 2 medium as described above . Experiments were repeated at least ﬁ ve times . Sensitivity to HU , MMS , and CFW YPD plates containing 100 or 200 mM HU , 0 . 033 % ( v / v ) MMS , or 8 mM CFW were prepared and used within 48 hr of preparation . Overnight cultures were inoculated in fresh YPD medium at an A 600 of 0 . 2 and grown at 30 (cid:2) . Log - phase cultures were adjusted to an A 600 of 0 . 4 before making 10 - fold serial dilutions and spotting 2 . 5 m l each on the plates . Cells containing plasmids such as pCla6 ( Diani et al . 2009 ) were grown in SD / Leu 2 medium ; SD / Leu 2 plates contained 25 or 50 mM HU . Western blot analysis Cell extracts were prepared from log - phase cultures as described previously ( Matmati et al . 2009 ) . An equal amount of each protein extract was fractionated by SDS - PAGE , blotted , and probed for Swe1 protein as previously de - scribed ( Matmati et al . 2009 ) . The Pstaire antibody ( Santa Cruz ) that recognizes amino acid residues 45 – 51 of Cdc2 - p34 was used as a control in all Western blot analyses . Samples were also run through SDS - PAGE in parallel to compare protein concentrations using Coomassie blue staining . Results Replication stress induces aberrant morphology in isc1 D cells Strains containing ISC1 gene deletions are sensitive to gen - otoxic agents HU and MMS in long - term exposure tests ( Matmati et al . 2009 ) . We observed that isc1 D cells devel - oped many morphological aberrations after exposure to ei - ther HU or MMS . Wild - type ( WT ) cells exposed to HU or MMS display modest elongation of mother cell or buds only after 22 hr of HU exposure . In contrast , isc1 D cells had many morphological abnormalities after exposure to either HU or MMS for 5 or 22 hr ( Figure 1 , A and B ) . The morphological changes could even be seen as early as 3 hr after genotoxic treatment ( data not shown ) . Abnormalities included elon - gated buds , seen in 60 % of cells 22 hr post - HU treatment , and daughter cells that did not separate from mother cells , ISC1 and Morphogenesis 535 resulting in chain - like structures of three or more cells ( Fig - ure 1C ) . After 22 hr of HU treatment , (cid:1) 22 % of the cells were found in three - cell chains and (cid:1) 5 % in four - cell chains ( Figure 1D ) . Often the bud attached to the mother cell was highly elongated . In the absence of HU treatment , a small population of isc1 D cells ( (cid:1) 3 % ) had elongated buds and three - cell chains ( Figure 1 , C and D ; 200 – 500 cells were counted in each sample for morphological defects ) . Perhaps these cells have experienced replication stress , DNA dam - age , or other types of stress and are more sensitive to that stress in the absence of isc1 . The pattern of HU - induced morphological abnormalities was also observed in isc1 D cells of the Jk9 - 3d “ a ” mating type as well as in isc1 D cells of BY4741 ; wild - type cells of each strain did not undergo signi ﬁ cant morphological change , whereas isc1 D cells formed elongated buds and chains of incompletely separated cells . These experiments suggest that Isc1 suppresses morphological irregularities un - der replication stress induced by HU and MMS . Abnormal chitin deposition in stressed isc1 D cells The cell wall is responsible for maintaining cell shape ; therefore , morphological abnormalities may indicate alter - ations in cell - wall dynamics , including chitin distribution , during morphogenesis ( De Groot et al . 2001 ; Roncero 2002 ) . Because HU - and MMS - treated isc1 D cells were often misshapen and had elongated buds or attached daughter cells , we investigated whether chitin deposition was altered in these cells . We stained cells with CFW that binds specif - ically to chitin in the cell wall . Regardless of HU treatment , wild - type cells displayed a thin line of chitin deposition on the cell wall and signi ﬁ cant ﬂ uorescence at the bud neck ( Figure 2A ) . Untreated isc1 D cells had a similar pattern of chitin deposition ( Figure 2A ) . However , after HU exposure , the elongated buds and chains of cells of the isc1 D strain showed a high level of ﬂ uorescence at different locations on the cell surface , including the tips of the elongated buds ( Figure 2A ) , suggesting increased chitin deposition and ab - normal cell - wall architecture . Our results suggest that Isc1 is needed for proper chitin deposition or cell - wall architecture in stressed cells . Nuclear division and bud morphogenesis in HU - treated isc1 D cells Wild - type cells are known to slow DNA synthesis and delay nuclear and cell division following replication stress such as that induced by HU treatment ( Slater 1973 ) . Generally DNA replication and nuclear division coordinate transition from polar bud growth to isotropic bud growth . We wanted to analyze the status of nuclear division following HU treat - ment of isc1 D cells . After 5 hr of HU exposure , the shape of wild - type cells remained normal but nuclei were found at the bud neck ( Figure 2B ) . Untreated isc1 D cells each had a nucleus but , after HU treatment , nuclei did not divide and remained at the bud neck ( Figure 2B ) . Although HU treat - ment delayed nuclear division in both WT and isc1 D cells , in the majority of isc1 D cells , buds continued to elongate ( polar growth ) in isc1 D cells . The results suggest that transition from polar bud growth to isotropic growth does not occur in isc1 D cells after HU treatment . Role of Isc1 in actin dynamics during replication stress The actin cytoskeleton plays a major role in bud growth and many other cellular events and is a key component of the Figure 1 HU and MMS induce morphological aberrations in isc1 D cells .

Interestingly , actin shows a deleterious complex haploinsuf ﬁ ciency with Isc1 ( Haarer et al . 2007 ) . Therefore , we investigated whether Isc1 plays any role in actin dynamics during replication stress by HU . Rhodamine – phalloidin staining revealed that , in WT cells , the actin cytoskeleton was present as polarized cables spreading from the mother cell to the bud ( Figure 3 ) . Actin depolarization was notable after 3 hr of HU treatment ( data not shown ) and after 5 hr almost all cells had depo - larized actin , seen as punctate staining throughout the cell ( Figure 3 ) . Rhodamine – phalloidin staining in untreated isc1 D cells was identical to that of WT cells . However , HU treatment did not cause any actin depolymerization in the isc1 D cells ( Figure 3A ) . In these cells , actin cables were clearly visible and extended from mother cell to the bud tip . The results suggest that Isc1 plays an important role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization during replication stress , and it may also control cellular morphogenesis . To be sure that the lack of actin depolarization in isc1 D cells was not simply due to an actin depolarization defect , but to media - tion of replication stress by isc1 D , we treated WT and isc1 D cells with latrunculin A ( LatA ) , a compound known to in - duce actin depolarization ( McMillan et al . 1998 ) , for 5 hr and then analyzed actin distribution . We observed punctate actin staining in both WT and isc1 D cells after LatA treat - ment ( Figure 3B ) , indicating depolarization . It is clear from these experiments that Isc1 controls actin depolarization in cells under replication stress . Isc1 acts in parallel with replication checkpoint mediators to maintain cell growth and morphology HU treatment activates the replication checkpoint ( Figure 4A ) and causes DNA replication arrest in an Mrc1 - Tof1 - Csm3 - dependent manner ( Katou et al . 2003 ; Bando et al . 2009 ; Tanaka et al . 2009 ) in which Csm3 forms hetero - trimers with Tof1 and Mrc1 ( Mayer et al . 2004 ; Xu et al . 2007 ; Bando et al . 2009 ) . MMS blocks progression of the replication fork , causes DNA damage , and activates the DNA damage checkpoint through Rad9 ( Putnam et al . 2009 ) ( Fig - ure 4A ) as well as the S - phase checkpoint . Interestingly , Rad9 can function at the replication fork in the absence of Mrc1 or Tof1 ( Foss 2001 ; Katou et al . 2003 ) . We investi - gated whether the defects of HU - treated isc1 D cells depend on these proteins by deleting MRC1 , TOF1 , CSM3 , and RAD9 in isc1 D cells . Genome - wide studies had already shown that simultaneous deletion of ISC1 and CSM3 induces synthetic growth defects ( Tong et al . 2004 ; Pan et al . 2006 ) . We con - structed isc1 D csm3 D , isc1 D mrc1 D , and isc1 D tof1 D strains and found them to be viable although slow growing ( Sup - porting Information , Figure S1 ) . Figure 2 Cell - wall defects and DAPI staining of isc1 D cells after HU exposure . ( A ) WT and isc1 D cells treated with HU were stained with CFW ( · 1000 - fold magni ﬁ cation ) .

ISC1 and Morphogenesis 537 Cell morphology of double - mutant strains of isc1 D mrc1 D , isc1 D tof1 D , and isc1 D csm3 D was assessed with and without HU treatment ( Figure 4 , B – F ) . Untreated single - mutant isc1 D , csm3 D , mrc1 D , or tof1 D strains did not display major morphological aberrations compared to untreated WT cells . However , double - mutant isc1 D mrc1 D , isc1 D tof1 D , and isc1 D csm3 D strains frequently formed large and sometimes misshapen mother cells and buds in comparison to WT cells and to the single - deletion derivatives even in the absence of genotoxic treatment ( Figure 4B ) . However , some major dif - ferences were observed in cell shape and size between HU - treated isc1 D cells and the untreated double - deletion strains isc1 D mrc1 D , isc1 D tof1 D , and isc1 D csm3 D ( compare Figure 1 , A and B with Figure 4B ) . In addition , the double - mutant strains had signi ﬁ cant chitin accumulation in the cell wall as evidenced by enhanced CFW staining compared to staining of WT and single - mutant cells ( Figure 4C ) . Cells with mor - phological aberrations are known to be sensitive to CFW ( De Groot et al . 2001 ; Enserink et al . 2006 ) ; thus we assessed CFW sensitivity in our strains . We found that CFW sensitivity was not signi ﬁ cantly different in WT , isc1 D , or tof1 D cells . However , isc1 D tof1 D cells were very sensitive to 25 m g / ml of CFW . We also tested mrc1 D and isc1 D mrc1 D strains and observed that the isc1 D mrc1 D strain was very sensitive to low concentrations of CFW ( 8 m g / ml ) and that the MRC1 deletion alone caused sensitivity to higher concentrations of CFW ( 25 m g / ml ; data not shown ) . The HU sensitivity of double - mutant isc1 D mrc1 D , isc1 D tof1 D , and isc1 D csm3 D cells was assessed . Single - mutant isc1 D , mrc1 D , and tof1 D cells were sensitive to both HU and MMS compared to WT cells . However , isc1 D mrc1 D and isc1 D tof1 D strains were much more sensitive to these genotoxins than was the WT strain or strains containing single deletions ( Figure 4E ) . Notably , double - deletion strains grew slowly — even when cultures of the same absorbance were cultured on YPD plates ( Figure S1 ) . Because isc1 D mrc1 D , isc1 D tof1 D , and isc1 D csm3 D cells were slow growing , they were treated with a low concentration of HU ( 25 mM ) to preserve viability while we assessed their morphology . As expected from analyses of untreated double - mutant strains , HU treatment induced severe morphological defects , includ - ing increased cell size , elongated buds , and chains of con - nected cells in isc1 D mrc1 D , isc1 D tof1 D , and isc1 D csm3 D cells ( Figure 4F ) . However , whereas the extent of cell elonga - tion and chain formation in the HU - induced isc1 D tof1 D ( n = 440 cells ) and isc1 D csm3 D ( n = 278 cells ) cells was not less than that of HU - treated isc1 D cells , the HU - treated isc1 D mrc1 D cells ( n = 314 cells ) showed (cid:1) 30 % less bud elongation and chain formation than the HU - treated isc1 D cells ( n = 415 cells ) ; all the HU - treated double - mutant cells Figure 4 Genetic interactions of ISC1 with replication checkpoint mediators MRC1 , TOF1 , and CSM3 and control cell morphol - ogy .

Mec1 and Tel1 are sensors and Rad53 is the major effector in both DNA replication checkpoint and DNA damage checkpoint ( Chk1 effector is not shown ) .

( E ) Spot tests of the WT , isc1 D , mrc1 D , isc1 D mrc1 D , tof1 D , and isc1 D tof1 D cells on YPD , YPD + 0 . 033 % MMS , 100 mM HU , and 200 mM HU plates show that isc1 D mrc1 D and isc1 D tof1 D cells grow slowly compared with other strains and are more sensitive to HU and MMS . ( F ) . Bars indicate the percentage of cells with HU - induced morphological aberrations ( elongated buds and chains of cells ) in isc1 D csm3 D , isc1 D mrc1 D , and isc1 D tof1 D strains compared to the isc1 D strain . 538 K . Tripathi et al . were bigger in size than the HU - treated isc1 D cells . The results suggest that the absence of MRC1 partially compromised HU - generated signal transduction . These results suggest that Tof1 and Csm3 do not play a role in the morphological defects of HU - treated isc1 D cells , whereas Mrc1 may play a minor role in promoting bud elongation and chain formation following HU treatment . Although the morphological aberrations in double - mutant strains are somewhat different from the HU - induced defects in isc1 D cells , we conclude that Isc1 acts in parallel with the replication checkpoint mediators to maintain cell growth and morphology in the absence of genotoxic treatment . Rad9 mediates signals of replication stress in isc1 D cells Although Mrc1 is the main replication checkpoint mediator functioning in HU treatment , Rad9 is known to function in its absence ( Katou et al . 2003 ) . To explore a possible role for Rad9 in cellular signaling during replication stress , an isc1 D rad9 D strain was constructed and characterized . The growth pattern of the double - mutant strain was reduced compared to wild type or either single - mutant strain ( Figure S2 ) , but its cellular morphology ( Figure 5A ) and CFW stain - ing pattern ( Figure 5B ) were normal . Both the isc1 D rad9 D strain and rad9 D strain were sensitive to HU and MMS ( Fig - ure 5 , C and D ) . Because these cells were highly sensitive to HU , we tested various concentrations of HU to identify a low concentration that induced morphological aberrations in isc1 D cells without killing the rad9 D and isc1 D rad9 D cells . It was observed that 25 mM HU was suf ﬁ cient to induce morphological aberrations in isc1 D cells . When cells were treated with 25 mM HU , WT and rad9 D cells displayed no morphological irregularities ( n = 214 cells ; data not shown ) whereas isc1 D cells had severe morphological defects in 41 % of the cells ( n = 415 cells ; Figure 5E ) . Interestingly , signi ﬁ cantly fewer isc1 D rad9 D cells — only 4 . 6 % — displayed morphological defects , and cells remained viable ( n = 277 cells ) . Following treatment with 100 mM HU , we found that , whereas (cid:1) 64 % of isc1 D cells had morphological defects , only (cid:1) 12 % of isc1 D rad9 D cells had similar defects ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that Rad9 plays an important role in the transmission of replication stress sig - nals generated in HU - treated isc1 D cells . Role of Rad53 in HU sensitivity and morphological aberrations of isc1 D cells We explored the possible involvement of the Rad53 effector in this pathway for the following reasons : ( 1 ) HU and MMS activate DNA integrity checkpoints in which signals from Mrc1 - Tof1 - Csm3 - Rad9 converge at the effector protein Rad53 ( Alcasabas et al . 2001 ; Foss 2001 ) ; ( 2 ) a reduction of cellular Rad53 concentration causes increased HU sensi - tivity of WT cells ( Cordon - Preciado et al . 2006 ) ; ( 3 ) Rad53 has been shown to control cellular morphology through Swe1 activity ( Enserink et al . 2006 ; Smolka et al . 2006 ; Diani et al . 2009 ) ; and ﬁ nally , ( 4 ) RAD9 , implicated ( above ) in this pathway , is an activator of RAD53 . To investigate the role of Rad53 , we transformed either an empty vector or a vector carrying RAD53 into WT and isc1 D strains . As expected , WT cells containing the vector alone were resis - tant to HU ; however , WT cells carrying an extra copy of RAD53 had modestly increased resistance to HU . Similarly , whereas isc1 D cells with an empty vector were sensitive to HU , isc1 D cells containing an extra copy of RAD53 showed a modest increase in resistance to HU ( Figure 6A ) . These data suggest that RAD53 dosage partially controls HU sen - sitivity of isc1 D cells . We conducted a quantitative analysis of the effects of an extra copy of RAD53 on the HU sensitivity of isc1 D cells . Figure 5 Signals generated in isc1 D cells after HU treatment pass through Rad9 to control cellular morphology . ( A ) Phase - contrast microscopy ( · 1000 ) revealed no morphological aberrations of isc1 D rad9 D cells when compared to WT , isc1 D , or rad9 D cells in the absence of genotoxic treatment .

( C and D ) Spot tests of serial dilutions of WT , isc1 D , rad9 D , and isc1 D rad9 D cells on YPD , YPD + HU , and YPD + MMS plates showing that isc1 D rad9 D cells are sen - sitive to both HU and MMS . ( E ) Bars show reduc - tion in HU - induced morphological aberrations in isc1 D rad9 D cells in comparison to isc1 D cells . ISC1 and Morphogenesis 539 Because HU slows DNA replication and growth , WT cells carrying an empty vector or an extra copy of RAD53 had a slower growth rate after HU exposure compared to un - treated cells ( Figure 6B ) . However , by 24 hr , cells exposed to HU reached the concentration of the untreated cells as the untreated cells slowly reached the stationary phase . In contrast , isc1 D cells containing only the chromosomal copy of RAD53 had severely reduced growth ( 75 % ) when ex - posed to HU compared to untreated cells . An extra copy of RAD53 restored the growth of cells treated with HU to the degree of untreated cells by 24 hr ( Figure 6C ) . We calcu - lated the generation times of the cultures during a 3 - to 6 - hr growth period and observed that isc1 D cells containing an empty vector had generation times of (cid:1) 1 . 8 and 4 . 8 hr with - out HU and with HU treatment , respectively . In contrast , isc1 D cells carrying a RAD53 plasmid showed a generation time of (cid:1) 1 . 8 hr in HU during the same time period . These experiments also indicate a role for Rad53 in the growth of isc1 D cells in HU . We also assessed the effect of RAD53 gene dosage on cellular morphology after HU treatment . Whereas isc1 D cells containing the chromosomal copy of RAD53 displayed in - creased morphological aberrations ( in 52 % of cells ) , an addi - tional copy of RAD53 signi ﬁ cantly reduced their HU - induced morphological irregularities to only 13 % of cells ( Figure 6D ) . We found such differences not only after 22 hr of HU expo - sure but also after 6 or 12 hr of HU exposure . To con ﬁ rm that the extra copy of RAD53 , and not a mutation in the isc1 D cells , was responsible for these results , we grew isc1 D cells containing the RAD53 plasmid from the above experiment in rich ( YPD ) medium for several generations to evict the plas - mid and then treated the resulting cells with HU as above . These cells displayed morphological aberrations , as did isc1 D cells that had always lacked RAD53 plasmid . Results of this experiment eliminate the possibility of a second mutation in the RAD53 - transformed isc1 D cells , causing the observed phenotypes . Role of Swe1 and Cdk1 proteins in determining cellular morphology during stress Because stabilization of the morphogenesis checkpoint regulator Swe1 occurs in isc1 D cells upon exposure to HU / MMS ( Matmati et al . 2009 ) , we investigated whether Swe1 is associated with morphological aberrations in isc1 D cells . As expected , stabilization of Swe1 was observed in both isc1 D tof1 D and isc1 D mrc1 D cells in comparison to WT , isc1 D , and tof1 D strains in the absence of genotoxic treat - ment ( Figure 7A ) . We also observed that morphological aberrations seen in isc1 D cells upon exposure to HU were dependent on the presence of Swe1 ( Figure 7 , B – D ) . Unlike the isc1 D strain , the isc1 D swe1 D strain did not differ in cel - lular morphology , CFW staining , or actin depolymerization from swe1 D and WT strains ( compare Figure 7 , B – D isc1 D swe1 D with Figure 1 , A and B , Figure 2 , and Figure 3 ) . We stained HU - treated swe1 D and isc1 D swe1 D cells with DAPI and observed that most of the cells had nuclei at the Figure 6 Increase in RAD53 dosage rescues HU sensi - tivity and HU - induced morphological aberrations of isc1 D cells . ( A ) WT and isc1 D cells were transformed with empty vector pRS315 or a plasmid containing a WT RAD53 gene expressed under the endogenous promoter . Fivefold dilutions of log - phase cells were spotted on SD / Leu 2 and SD / Leu 2 / HU and incubated at 30 (cid:2) . Both WT and isc1 D cells containing RAD53 had increased resistance to HU compared to cells con - taining the empty vector . ( B ) WT cells containing either an empty vector or a RAD53 plasmid were grown in SD / Leu 2 and SD / Leu 2 / HU liquid media , and absor - bance of all cultures was monitored at 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , and 24 hr .

Cells were collected 22 hr after HU exposure , ﬁ xed with formaldehyde , and ana - lyzed for morphological aberrations by phase - contrast microscopy ( · 400 ) . 540 K . Tripathi et al . bud neck and no morphological irregularities ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that the morphological aber - rations in isc1 D cells under replication stress require Swe1 . Because Swe1 controls G2 / M arrest by inactivating Cdk1 in isc1 D cells ( Matmati et al . 2009 ) , we tested whether the morphological aberrations of isc1 D cells occurred due to in - activation of Cdk1 . As expected , expression of a nonphos - phorylatable mutant of CDK1 , Cdk1 Y19F ( Y19F , n = 407 ; in comparison to WT Cdk1 , n = 404 ) , in isc1 D cells prevented the induction of morphological aberrations by HU to a large extent ( Figure 7E ) . These results strongly suggest that Isc1 protein controls cellular morphology during HU exposure by destabilizing Swe1 such that Cdk1 remains active . Isc1 functions through actin regulators during budding Actin assembly and disassembly is regulated by proteins in more than one pathway ( Pruyne and Bretscher 2000a , b ; Rodal et al . 2005 ; Moseley and Goode 2006 ) . For example , formin homologs Bni1 and Bnr1 are downstream targets of Rho proteins and function in actin cable nucleation ( Imamura et al . 1997 ) . Whereas Bni1 controls actin cable nucleation in the bud , Bnr1 functions at the bud neck ( Pruyne et al . 2004 ) . Bni1 is a member of the polarisome complex and has been implicated in bud elongation during nitrogen star - vation of diploid cells ( Bidlingmaier and Snyder 2004 ; Liu et al . 2010 ) . We wanted to test whether Bni1 functions downstream of Isc1 during HU stress . BNI1 was deleted in isc1 D cells , and the resulting cells were characterized upon HU treatment . Whereas isc1 D cells showed elongated buds and polarized actin , isc1 D bni1 D cells had shorter buds , and some cells showed a few depolarized actin spots ( Figure S3A ) . However , the reversal was not complete , suggesting that additional proteins play a role in actin cable nucleation in isc1 D cells . To identify other proteins involved in this process , we looked to the Cdk1 pathway . Cdk1 controls actin cable or - ganization through Cdc42 that , in turn , controls actin organization by forming a complex with Cdc42 and Bem1 ( Wang 2009 ) . BEM1 and ISC1 have been shown to share positive genetic interactions ( Fiedler et al . 2009 ) , and they may function in a common pathway to control bud morpho - genesis . To test this possibility , we constructed an isc1 D bem1 D strain , treated it with HU , and found that bud elongation occurred much faster than in the isc1 D strain ( Figure S3B ) , suggesting that the two genes may function in parallel pathways to control bud elongation during replication stress . To determine whether Isc1 functions through the pro - teins known to control actin disassembly such as co ﬁ lin , coronin , and Aip1 ( Lin et al . 2010 ) during replication stress , a plasmid containing GFP - tagged COF1 ( Gandhi et al . 2009 ) was transformed into WT and isc1 D cells . Following HU treatment , Cof1 - GFP dynamics were compared to actin dy - namics via rhodamine – phalloidin staining ( Figure S3C ) . In untreated WT cells , actin cables spread from mother to daughter cells with the highest phalloidin staining seen in Figure 7 Role of Swe1 in deter - mining morphology of isc1 D cells under replication stress . ( A ) Ex - pression pro ﬁ le of Swe1 in the WT , isc1 D , tof1 D , isc1 D tof1 D , mrc1 D , and isc1 D mrc1 D strains . P - STAIRE antibody probing of the same samples shows equal load - ing of protein in various samples . ( B ) Phase - contrast microscopy reveals similar cell morphology of indicated strains regardless of HU treatment . ( C ) Rhodamine – phalloidin staining shows that SWE1 deletion in isc1 D cells restores actin depolymerization upon HU treatment as in WT cells . ( D ) CFW staining shows that swe1 D and isc1 D swe1 D cells have no cell - wall defect . ( E ) Expression of the Cdk1 Y19F mu - tant , but not WT CDK1 , rescues isc1 D cells to a large extent from budding defects after HU exposure . ISC1 and Morphogenesis 541 the daughter cells ; Cof1 - GFP was fairly evenly distributed in mother and daughter cells . After HU treatment , actin cables in WT cells were disassembled to form punctate structures and Cof1 - GFP also appeared in a punctate pattern in most cells ( Figure S3C ) . In the isc1 D cells , actin and Cof1 - GFP were similarly distributed regardless of whether the cells were treated with HU ( Figure S3C ) . All these data suggest that Isc1 functions through actin regulators to control actin depolymerization during replication stress . Response to galactose - or butanol - induced stress is also Swe1 dependent Because the isc1 D cells displayed morphological aberrations under HU and MMS stress , we investigated whether they would show similar phenotypes under other stress condi - tions . Cells were grown in the presence of either galactose or butanol , both of which induced extensive morphological aberrations in isc1 D cells compared to WT cells ( Figure 8 , A and B ) . It is known that a small proportion ( 2 – 3 % ) of WT cells display morphological aberrations after treatment with galactose ( Palecek et al . 2002 ) . In contrast , butanol has been shown to induce morphological aberrations in haploid WT yeast in a strain - speci ﬁ c manner . Although morphological aberrations were induced in S 1278b and W303 strains , bu - tanol did not induce aberrations in the S288c strain ( Lorenz et al . 2000 ) . In WT cells of the Jk9 - 3d ( “ a ” type ) strain used in this study , we observed morphological aberrations in , 1 % of cells after treatment with either galactose or buta - nol . However , . 70 % of isc1 D cells displayed morphological aberrations after treatment ( Figure 8 , A and B ) . Because we found that Swe1 controls the morphology of HU - treated isc1 D cells ( Figure 7 ) , we investigated whether Swe1 plays a similar role after galactose or butanol treat - ment . If so , deletion of SWE1 in isc1 D cells should abolish the morphological defects . Unlike isc1 D cells , neither swe1 D nor isc1 D swe1 D cells displayed morphological aberrations after galactose or butanol treatment . These experiments show that both galactose and butanol induced morphologi - cal aberrations in isc1 D cells in a Swe1 - dependent manner . These experiments , taken together , strongly suggest that , under several stress conditions , the absence of the ISC1 gene leads to morphological defects and that these events are Swe1 dependent . Isc1 also cooperates with various DNA integrity and morphogenesis checkpoint proteins and with several actin regulators to control cellular morphology un - der replication stress . Finally , Rad9 and Rad53 control the HU - dependent morphological aberrations of isc1 D cells . Discussion The goal of the present study was to dissect the role of ISC1 in determining cellular morphology during replication stress in yeast . Our results suggest that ISC1 is a key regulator of cellular morphogenesis under a broad range of environmen - tal stressors . The results show that the absence of ISC1 leads to morphological aberrations , cell - wall defects , and defects in actin depolymerization during HU treatment . The repli - cation checkpoint mediators Tof1 or Csm3 ( and to a large extent Mrc1 ) do not play a major role in transmission of the signals generated in isc1 D cells during HU treatment . How - ever , Isc1 functions in parallel with these mediators to con - trol cell growth and morphology in unperturbed cells . The DNA damage checkpoint mediator Rad9 was found to control signals generated by HU treatment in isc1 D cells , leading to morphological defects . The checkpoint effector Rad53 , activated by Rad9 upon DNA damage , also controls HU - dependent morphological aberrations of isc1 D cells , sug - gesting that DNA damage checkpoint proteins are active un - der these conditions . However , there is no evidence that the DNA damage checkpoint itself controls morphology . Inter - estingly , Swe1 and Cdk1 were found to control morpholog - ical defects of isc1 D cells . Finally , the role of ISC1 in cellular morphology was not limited to replication stress ; this sphin - golipid gene was also found to control cell morphology un - der other stress conditions such as during galactose or butanol treatment . We ﬁ nd that Rad9 and Swe1 function differently to con - trol morphology in response to HU stress in isc1 D cells . Deletion of RAD9 reduced morphological aberrations to a large extent in isc1 D cells during HU stress . In C . albicans , genotoxin - induced morphological aberrations are reduced by RAD9 deletion ( Shi et al . 2007 ) . Rad9 is known to cause G2 / M arrest upon DNA damage , and rad9 D cells are MMS / HU sensitive . Although isc1 D rad9 D cells had fewer morpholog - ical defects at low HU concentrations , they are not resistant Figure 8 Galactose and butanol induce morphological aberrations in isc1 D cells in a Swe1 - dependent manner .

Tripathi et al . to HU because rad9 D cells are also partially sensitive to HU . In contrast , isc1 D swe1 D cells showed no morphological defects as well as increased HU resistance . Although both Swe1 and Rad9 control HU - induced morphological aberrations in isc1 D cells , we do not know if they are acting in a single pathway or in two different pathways ( see Figure 9 ) . Because our experi - ments demonstrate that the effect of Swe1 in isc1 D cells is greater than the individual effects of Rad9 , Rad53 , or Cdk1 , Swe1 may operate through various effector molecules to cause cell elongation in isc1 D cells during HU stress . Rad53 has been shown to control cellular morphology ( Enserink et al . 2006 , 2009 ; Diani et al . 2009 ) . Our study shows that increasing Rad53 gene dosage decreases the morphological aberrations of isc1 D cells to a large extent . How does Isc1 control Rad53 ? Isc1 may partially regulate Rad53 function by altering its concentration , activity , and phosphorylation status . Although it is possible that Isc1 con - trols the morphological functions of Rad53 through Rad9 , the DNA damage checkpoint functions of Rad9 and Rad53 may or may not be involved in this process . At present , the proteins that transmit HU - induced signals in isc1 D cells to Rad9 / Rad53 are not known , but two differ - ent models can explain our results . On one hand , it is pos - sible that Isc1 controls morphological functions of Rad53 function , which in turn , may control Swe1 , and ultimately control Cdk1 . On the other hand , Rad53 has phosphoryla - tion targets of Cdk1 , and a speci ﬁ c amino acid residue on Rad53 has been implicated in its role in certain aspects of morphogenesis ( Diani et al . 2009 ) . It has been shown that both Swe1 and Cdk1 control HU - mediated G2 / M arrest of isc1 D cell sensitivity ( Matmati et al . 2009 ) , and we show here that they control morphological aberrations of isc1 D cells under HU stress . It is possible that Rad53 activity is affected in HU - treated isc1 D cells through Cdk1 and Rad9 via two independent pathways . This may control Swe1 sta - bilization and activity in the isc1 D cells . It is known that Swe1 accumulation leading to aberrant morphology occurs in both untreated and HU - treated rad53 D cells ( Enserink et al . 2006 ) . Regulation of one or more proteins from among Rad53 , Rad9 , Cdk1 , and Swe1 by phosphorylation is an attractive possibility since Isc1 generates ceramide that may , in turn , activate protein phosphatases . Detailed muta - tional analysis of ISC1 and related sphingolipid genes is necessary to understand the possible role of the sphingolipid pathway in controlling Rad53 activity . Similarly , mutational analyses as well as biochemical analyses of Rad53 will show how Isc1 controls Rad53 activity . Experiments are underway to understand the mechanism of action of Isc1 on Rad53 function . Our ﬁ ndings clearly indicate that both replication check - point and DNA damage checkpoint proteins play signi ﬁ cant roles in cellular morphogenesis . Although Mrc1 , Tof1 , and Csm3 do not play a signi ﬁ cant role in the morphological defects of isc1 D cells upon HU exposure , simultaneous dele - tions of ISC1 and MRC1 / TOF1 / CSM3 caused slow growth and frequent basal morphogenetic aberrations in the ab - sence of genotoxic treatment ( albeit in a somewhat different manner than that of isc1 D cells during HU stress ) . These ﬁ ndings suggest the following : ( 1 ) that ISC1 functions re - dundantly with replication checkpoint mediator genes MRC1 , TOF1 , and CSM3 to control cellular morphology and cell growth ; ( 2 ) that Swe1 stability plays an important downstream role in this process ; and ( 3 ) that Tof1 and Csm3 play key roles in cellular morphology , a role revealed in the absence of ISC1 . Previous studies had implicated other checkpoint proteins such as Mec1 and Tel1 , Mrc1 and Rad9 , and Rad53 in cellular morphology ( Jiang and Kang 2003 ; Enserink et al . 2006 ) in S . cerevisiae and Mec1 , Rad9 , and Rad53 in C . albicans ( Shi et al . 2007 ) . Results from this study also speci ﬁ cally connect Isc1 to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics . Whereas wild - type cells undergo actin depolymerization upon expo - sure to HU , isc1 D cells do not , suggesting that Isc1 controls Figure 9 Model depicts mechanisms by which morphological defects are induced in isc1 D cells under stress conditions . ( A ) In one pathway , HU treatment of isc1 D cells generates signals that are recognized by Rad9 and passed to Rad53 , inhibiting the latter and leading to overproduction and / or stabilization of Swe1 . This leads to Cdk1 phosphorylation and inactivation , resulting in a G2 / M arrest and defects in actin dynamics . Furthermore , ISC1 gene deletion causes cell - wall defects under HU stress . The combination of the actin defect and the cell - wall defect leads to morphological aberrations . Alternatively , HU treatment of isc1 D cells leads to stabilization of Swe1 , which inactivates Cdk1 ; also HU treatment of isc1 D cells causes signaling through Rad9 and Rad53 . Both Cdk1 and Rad53 ( see parallel pathways in Figure 9A ) pathways ﬁ nally lead to actin and cell - wall defects , causing morphological aberrations . Finally , Cdk1 is known to phosphorylate Rad53 to control cellular morphology . In isc1 D cells , this pathway may also be active ( arrow from Cdk1 to Rad53 ) . The role of Mrc1 , Tof1 , and Csm3 is not shown . ( B ) Galactose or butanol treatment of isc1 D cells causes Swe1 stabilization that , in turn , causes morphological aberrations . ISC1 and Morphogenesis 543 actin depolymerization speci ﬁ cally during replication stress . Several studies have shown that ISC1 interacts genetically with actin . ISC1 and ACT1 genes share complex haploinsuf - ﬁ ciency interactions , suggesting complementary roles for each of the two genes in the maintenance of cell growth and viability ( Haarer et al . 2007 ) . Diploid cells containing a single copy each of ISC1 and ACT1 show a severe growth defect , and similar defects in both cell growth and morphol - ogy also occur when the wild - type ACT1 gene is replaced by act1 - 105 or act1 - 111 ( Wertman et al . 1992 ; Cali et al . 1998 ; Haarer et al . 2007 ) . Furthermore , defects in cell growth and actin depolarization in a slm1 D slm2 ts mutant were abolished by deletion of the ISC1 gene along with the calcineurin gene ( Tabuchi et al . 2006 ) . These results and the current ﬁ ndings suggest that Isc1 plays a key role in maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton and controls cellular morphology under DNA replication stress . As shown by a previous work ( Enserink et al . 2006 ) , we observed that HU treatment caused actin depolarization in WT cells , indicated by punctuate staining ( that was not seen in isc1 D cells ) . It is possible that the punctate staining of actin is a re ﬂ ection of actin patches . When actin patches switch from a polar to an isotropic pattern , no polar actin patterns or actin cables are seen . Many HU - treated isc1 D cells are growing in a polar manner , and thus actin cables and high concentrations of patches in the early buds or tips of elongated cells are expected . Thus , the in ﬂ uence of HU on actin in isc1 D cells could be indirect . Several other sphingolipid pathway genes such as LCB1 , RVS161 , and RVS167 have been implicated in actin dynam - ics ( Munn et al . 1995 ; Zanolari et al . 2000 ) . However , the ﬁ nding that ISC1 controls actin dynamics upon HU exposure is novel . Deletion of BNI1 in isc1 D cells partially abolishes the actin defect , suggesting that Isc1 plays a key role in actin depolarization in HU by affecting actin regulators . However , since deletion of BNI1 confers only a partial effect , there are other genes playing redundant roles to control actin disrup - tion mediated by ISC1 . These data suggest that studies of other actin regulators are needed to determine how Isc1 might control actin dynamics under HU stress . Isc1 also seems to play an important role in cell - wall synthesis . Chitin accumulates to high levels in the cell wall and bud tips during exposure to HU in isc1 D cells as well as in isc1 D mrc1 D , isc1 D tof1 D , and isc1 D csm3 D cells . Isc1 , along with the replication checkpoint mediators , may be involved in a cell - wall checkpoint ( Harvey and Kellogg 2003 ) . Re - cently , it was observed that the cell - wall synthesis gene CWP1 was upregulated during the diauxic shift in isc1 D cells ( Kitagaki et al . 2009 ) . In addition , deletion of the ISC1 ho - molog CSS1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe caused severe cell - wall defects , including unusual accumulation of glucans in the periplasmic space , suggesting that Css1 plays a key role in cell - wall synthesis ( Feoktistova et al . 2001 ) . These observations strongly suggest that there is a link between sphingolipid metabolism and cell - wall synthesis in both yeast species . However , at present we do not have direct evidence of Isc1 controlling cell - wall synthesis . Moreover , changes in actin dynamics can affect cell - wall dynamics , and isc1 D cells show defects in actin dynamics in HU . Thus the defect in cell walls of isc1 D cells may be indirect . Another major ﬁ nding is that Isc1 regulates cellular mor - phology not only under HU / MMS stress , but also during galactose - and butanol - induced stress , and that Swe1 con - trols this response . Isc1 may act not only along with check - point proteins but also with or through various proteins of the cAMP and MAPK pathways to control cell morphology . Future experiments will elucidate the detailed mechanism of action of Isc1 in determining cell morphology under various stress conditions . Our current understanding of the control of cellular morphology by Isc1 can be summarized in several models ( see Figure 9 ) . For example , in the absence of ISC1 ( Figure 9A ) , HU stress may act on Rad9 to control Rad53 . Inhibition of Rad53 stabilizes Swe1 such that Cdk1 is inactivated . Loss of Cdk1 activity in turn causes defects in actin dynamics and cell - wall synthesis , resulting in morphological aberrations . Alternatively , HU exposure of isc1 D cells can cause Swe1 accumulation ( by a yet - unknown mechanism ) leading to Cdk1 inactivation . In parallel , HU exposure of isc1 D cells activates the Rad9 - Rad53 pathway . Both pathways contrib - ute to actin defects and cell - wall defects leading to morpho - logical aberrations . These parallel pathways may in ﬂ uence each other or act independently . A third possibility is that treatment of isc1 D cells with HU may also lead to Swe1 accumulation inducing Cdk1 phosphorylation , which can affect Rad53 phosphorylation . Cdk1 - dependent Rad53 phosphorylation already has been implicated in morphogen - esis in yeast ( Diani et al . 2009 ) . All three pathways may be used simultaneously to affect cell morphology also . Finally , a pathway supported by our ﬁ ndings suggests that deletion of MRC1 , TOF1 , or CSM3 in an isc1 D strain also leads to Swe1 stabilization and morphological aberrations . In conclusion , we have shown for the ﬁ rst time that a sphingolipid pathway gene ( ISC1 ) controls cellular mor - phogenesis under various stress conditions . We have further demonstrated that the DNA replication checkpoint media - tors Mrc1 , Tof1 , and Csm3 function in parallel with Isc1 to monitor cell - wall and cellular morphology . Also , we ﬁ nd that the Isc1 protein coordinates the checkpoint mediator Rad9 , the checkpoint effector Rad53 , the stability of the morpho - genesis checkpoint regulator Swe1 , the activity of the cell cycle regulator Cdk1 , and actin dynamics to control cellular morphology under HU stress . Finally , the Isc1 protein con - trols cell morphology under various stress conditions through the Swe1 protein .
