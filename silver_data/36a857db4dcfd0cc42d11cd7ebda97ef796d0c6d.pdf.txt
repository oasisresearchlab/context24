Andrade - Navarro , 2 Jens P . von Kries , 1 Tobias Stauber , 1 , 2 * Thomas J . Jentsch 1 , 2 , 4 * Regulation of cell volume is critical for many cellular and organismal functions , yet the molecular identity of a key player , the volume - regulated anion channel VRAC , has remained unknown . A genome - wide small interfering RNA screen in mammalian cells identified LRRC8A as a VRAC component . LRRC8A formed heteromers with other LRRC8 multispan membrane proteins . Genomic disruption of LRRC8A ablated VRAC currents . Cells with disruption of all five LRRC8 genes required LRRC8A cotransfection with other LRRC8 isoforms to reconstitute VRAC currents . The isoform combination determined VRAC inactivation kinetics . Taurine flux and regulatory volume decrease also depended on LRRC8 proteins . Our work shows that VRAC defines a class of anion channels , suggests that VRAC is identical to the volume - sensitive organic osmolyte / anion channel VSOAC , and explains the heterogeneity of native VRAC currents . C ells regulate their volume to counteract swelling or shrinkage caused by osmotic challenges and during processes such as cell growth , division , and migration . As water transport across cellular membranes is driven by osmotic gradients , cell volume regulation re - quires appropriate changes of intracellular con - centrations of ions or organic osmolytes such as taurine ( 1 , 2 ) . Regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) follows the extrusion of intracellular Cl – and K + and other osmolytes across the plasma membrane . A key player is the volume - regulated anion channel VRAC that mediates character - istic swelling - activated Cl – currents [ I Cl ( swell ) ] and is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells ( 3 – 5 ) . Nearly inactive under resting conditions , VRAC slowly opens upon hypotonic swelling . The mech - anism behind VRAC opening remains enigmatic . VRAC currents are outwardly rectifying [ hence the alternative name VSOR for volume - stimulated outward rectifier ( 4 , 5 ) ] and show variable inac - tivation at inside - positive voltages . VRAC con - ducts iodide ( I – ) better than chloride ( Cl – ) and might also conduct organic osmolytes such as taurine ( 6 ) [ hence VSOAC , volume - stimulated organic osmolyte / anion channel ( 7 ) ] , but this notion is controversial ( 8 – 10 ) . VRAC is believed to be important for cell volume regulation and swelling - induced exocytosis ( 11 ) and also for cell cycle regulation , proliferation , and migra - tion ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) . It may play a role in apoptosis and various pathological states , including ischemic brain edema and cancer ( 4 , 12 ) . Progress in the characterization of VRAC and its biological roles has been limited by the failure to identify the underlying protein ( s ) despite decades of efforts ( 1 , 5 ) . ClC - 2 Cl – channels activate upon cell swelling , but their inward rectification and Cl – over I – selectivity deviate from VRAC ( 13 ) . Drosophila dBest1 , a member of a family of Ca 2 + - activated Cl – channels , mediates swelling - activated Cl – currents in insect cells ( 14 , 15 ) , but their characteristics differ from those of VRAC currents , and the mammalian homolog of dBest1 is swelling - insensitive ( 16 ) . We show that VRAC represents a distinct class of anion channels that also conduct organic osmolytes . To identify VRAC , we used a genome - wide RNA interference screen that could identify non - redundant VRAC components . Swelling - induced I – influx into human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) cells expressing the I – - sensitive yellow fluores - cent protein YFP ( H148Q / I152L ) ( 17 ) was used as readout in a fluorometric imaging plate reader ( Fig . 1A ) . Exposure to saline containing 50 mM I – yielded a slow fluorescence decay under iso - tonic conditions , whereas hypotonicity induced a delayed increase in YFP quenching ( Fig . 1B ) that could be reduced by VRAC inhibitors such as carbenoxolone ( 18 ) ( fig . S1 ) . In a prescreen targeting 21 anion transporters ( table S1 ) , only small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) against the Cl – / HCO 3 – exchanger AE2 gave significant ef - fects ( Fig . 1B ) . They decreased I – influx under both isotonic and hypotonic conditions . Our genome - wide screen used three separate - ly transfected siRNAs per gene ( fig . S2 ) . Offline data analysis ( fig . S3 , A and B ) yielded the max - imal slope of fluorescence quenching that was used to define hits . Further criteria included the presence of predicted transmembrane domains and a wide expression pattern . Eighty - seven genes ( table S2 ) were taken into a secondary screen with independent siRNAs .

LRRC8A knockdown also strongly suppressed I Cl ( swell ) in patch - clamp experiments ( Fig . 1 , D to F ) , suggesting that the multispan membrane protein LRRC8A is an indispensable component of VRAC or is needed for its activation . Although LRRC8A reached the plasma mem - brane ( Fig . 1G , and fig . S4A for HeLa cells ) , its transfection into HEK cells rather decreased I Cl ( swell ) ( Fig . 1F ) . We hypothesized that VRAC contains LRRC8A as part of a heteromer and that LRRC8A overexpression led to a subunit stoichiometry that was incompatible with channel activity . LRRC8A has four closely related homologs ( LRRC8B to LRRC8E ) , which all have four predicted trans - membrane domains ( 19 , 20 ) . Expressed sequence tag ( EST ) databases suggested that all homologs were widely expressed . Immunocytochemistry of transfected HeLa cells ( fig . S4A ) and of native HEK cells ( Fig . 1 , G and H ) detected LRRC8A at the plasma membrane . Truncation of its C termi - nus , as in a patient with agammaglobulinemia ( 21 ) , led to cytoplasmic retention ( fig . S4B ) . LRRC8B through LRRC8E remained intracellular when transfected alone , but reached the plasma mem - brane when cotransfected with LRRC8A ( Fig . 1 , I and J , and fig . S4 , C to H ) . Unlike LRRC8A transfection , LRRC8A and LRRC8C coexpres - sion did not suppress I Cl ( swell ) ( Fig . 1F ) . However , neither this coexpression , nor any other com - bination tested , significantly increased current amplitudes above wild - type ( WT ) values . We used zinc - finger nuclease and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ( CRISPR ) – Cas ( 22 ) technologies to constitutively disrupt LRRC8 genes . In addition to polyploid HEK cells , we used stably diploid human HCT116 cells for increased disruption efficiency . Gene disruption was confirmed by sequencing and West - ern blots ( Fig . 2A and table S3 ) . To exclude off - target effects , we generated two HEK and three HCT116 lines in which LRRC8A was disrupted at different positions ( tables S3 and S4 ) . I Cl ( swell ) was abolished in all five lines and could be res - cued by LRRC8A transfection ( Fig . 2 , B and C , and fig . S5 ) , demonstrating that LRRC8A is essential for I Cl ( swell ) . We also produced HCT116 cells in which other LRRC8 genes were disrupted singly or in combinations , including a line with disruption of all five LRRC8 genes ( henceforth called LRRC8 − / − cells ) . Except for LRRC8A , dis - ruption of single LRRC8 genes did not abolish VRAC currents ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . However , I Cl ( swell ) amplitudes were robustly reduced in LRRC8E − / − and in LRRC8 ( C / E ) − / − double and LRRC8 ( C / D / E ) − / − triple knockout ( KO ) cells . I Cl ( swell ) was abolished in LRRC8 ( B / C / D / E ) − / − cells ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . I Cl ( swell ) inactivated faster and at less positive po - tentials in LRRC8C − / − and LRRC8 ( C / E ) − / − cells compared to WT HCT116 , LRRC8B − / − , LRRC8D − / − , or LRRC8E − / − cells . By contrast , I Cl ( swell ) inacti - vated more slowly and at more positive voltages in LRRC8 ( D / E ) − / − HTC116 cells ( Fig . 2 , B and D , and fig . S6D ) and in WT HEK cells ( Figs . 1E and 2D ) . I Cl ( swell ) of these mutant cell lines re - tained the ion selectivity of WT VRAC with the characteristic I – > NO 3 – > Cl – > > Glc – ( gluconate ) permeability sequence ( fig . S6A ) . LRRC8A transfection into quintuple KO LRRC8 − / − cells failed to rescue I Cl ( swell ) ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) , agreeing with the absence of I Cl ( swell ) in LRRC8 ( B / C / D / E ) − / − cells ( Fig . 2 , B and C ) . Cotransfecting LRRC8 − / − cells with LRRC8A and either LRRC8C or LRRC8E yielded I Cl ( swell ) with current densities similar to those of native cells ( Fig . 2F ) . Coexpressing LRRC8A with LRRC8D yielded lower currents ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . No current was observed upon coexpression of LRRC8A and LRRC8B , which may relate to the poor expression of LRRC8B ( Fig . 3 , D and F ) . These findings are consistent with the low currents observed in LRRC8 ( C / E ) − / − cells ( Fig . 2C ) , where LRRC8A can only interact with poorly expressed LRRC8B and / or LRRC8D .

I Cl ( swell ) inactivated more slowly and at more positive voltages when LRRC8Awas coexpressed with LRRC8C in LRRC8 − / − cells compared to cells coexpressing LRRC8A with LRRC8E or LRRC8D ( Fig . 2 , E and G , and fig . S6E ) . This observation was in agreement with the faster I Cl ( swell ) inactivation in LRRC8C − / − cells ( Fig . 2 , B and D , and fig . S6D ) in which the “ decelerating ” LRRC8C subunit may be replaced by LRRC8E or other “ accelerating ” subunits . Native I Cl ( swell ) currents display different in - activation kinetics ( 3 ) . Whereas I Cl ( swell ) shows prominent inactivation at positive potentials in HEK cells ( 23 , 24 ) ( Fig . 1E , Fig . 2D , and fig . S6D ) and even more inactivation in HCT116 cells ( Fig . 2 , B and D , and fig . S6D ) , it inactivates much less in blood cells such as promyelocytic HL - 60 cells and in vascular smooth muscle and neurons ( 24 – 26 ) . EST databases suggest that these cells express the “ decelerating ” subunit LRRC8C , but lack LRRC8E that potently induces inactiv - ation ( Fig . 2 , E and G , and fig . S6E ) . Quantitative reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction confirmed that HEK and HCT116 cells expressed LRRC8A through LRRC8E , whereas LRRC8E was almost absent from HL - 60 cells ( fig . S7 ) . Moreover , HCT116 cells , whose I Cl ( swell ) inacti - vates to a greater extent than that of HEK cells ( Fig . 1E , Fig . 2 , B and D , and fig . S6D ) , express less “ decelerating ” LRRC8C than HEK ( fig . S7 ) . LRRC8 proteins have four predicted trans - membrane domains ( TMDs ) followed by hydro - philic C termini with up to 17 leucine - rich repeats ( 27 ) ( Fig . 3A ) . Their C termini were originally thought to be extracellular ( 19 , 21 ) , but proteome databases revealed ( 20 ) that the TMD2 - TMD3 linker can be phosphorylated and suggested that LRRC8 N and C termini are cytoplasmic ( Fig . 3A ) . LRRC8 proteins display weak homology ( 20 ) to pannexins , pore - forming proteins ( 28 ) with Fig . 2 . Characterization of LRRC8 KO cells and of reconstituted I Cl ( swell ) .

Connexins form hexa - meric hemichannels and gap junctions ( 29 ) . This similarity suggested ( 20 ) that LRRC8 proteins form hexameric channels for as yet unknown sub - strates . Like VRAC currents ( 14 , 15 , 30 ) , LRRC8 proteins are found in vertebrates but not in other phyla such as arthropoda ( 20 ) . We ascertained the pannexin - and connexin - like transmembrane topology of LRRC8A . Mutat - ing potential N - linked glycosylation sites between TMD1 and TMD2 abolished the size shift upon PNGaseF treatment ( Fig . 3B ) , demonstrating that this loop is extracellular . Immunofluorescence of cells transfected with hemagglutinin ( HA ) – tagged LRRC8A constructs showed that the TMD3 - 4 segment is extracellular and the C ter - minus cytoplasmic ( Fig . 3C ) . The formation of LRRC8 heteromers was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation from HEK cells transfected with LRRC8A and epitope - tagged versions of either LRRC8B , C , D , or E . LRRC8A coprecipitated each of the other isoforms , but not the Cl – channel ClC - 1 used as a control ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . Conversely , precipitation of epitope - tagged versions of LRRC8B through LRRC8E copre - cipitated LRRC8A ( Fig . 3F ) . Coprecipitation of LRRC8 isoforms was also observed for native HEK cells ( fig . S8 ) . Hypotonicity induced a robust taurine efflux from HEK and HCT116 cell lines , but not from their LRRC8A − / − derivates ( Fig . 4A and fig . S9A ) , where taurine efflux could be rescued by LRRC8A and LRRC8C cotransfection ( fig . S9B for HEK cells ) . Taurine efflux was also abolished in LRRC8 ( B / C / D / E ) − / − HCT116 cells ( Fig . 4A ) . Because both I Cl ( swell ) and swelling - induced taurine efflux similarly depended on LRRC8 hetero - mers , VRAC is most likely identical to VSOAC , the volume - sensitive organic osmolyte / anion chan - nel ( 7 ) . Accordingly , LRRC8A − / − HEK cells showed severely impaired volume regulation . After ini - tial swelling , WT , but not LRRC8A − / − , cells slowly reduced their volume in the continuous presence of extracellular hypotonicity ( Fig . 4B ) . Hence , LRRC8 - containing VSOAC plays a major role in RVD . The absence of I Cl ( swell ) upon genomic dis - ruption of LRRC8A and its rescue by transient reexpression identified LRRC8A as an indispen - sable component of VRAC , or alternatively , as being crucial for its activation . The wide expres - sion pattern of LRRC8 genes and the plasma mem - brane residency of LRRC8A - containing heteromers fulfill the prerequisites for LRRC8 proteins form - ing the channel . The dependence of current proper - ties on LRRC8 isoform combinations indicated that LRRC8 heteromers are integral components Fig . 3 . Transmembrane topology and heteromerization of LRRC8A .

Because cotrans - fection of LRRC8 isoforms did not significantly increase I Cl ( swell ) amplitude over that of the WT , other factors limit VRAC activity ; for example , an auxiliary subunit of VRAC or part of the sig - naling cascade leading to its activation . Indeed , VRAC currents seem to be highly regulated , with amplitudes differing by a factor of only 2 to 3 across cell types ( 3 , 30 ) . The homology between LRRC8 proteins and pannexins suggested that LRRC8 proteins form hexameric channels ( 20 ) . We confirmed the pannexin - like topology of LRRC8A and pro - pose that VRAC is formed by LRRC8 hexa - mers of LRRC8A and at least one other family member . In this model , VRAC may contain two to five different LRRC8 isoforms , creating a po - tentially large variety of VRAC channels with different properties . The variation of I Cl ( swell ) in - activation kinetics between different tissues and cells ( 3 ) can be ascribed to different expression ratios of LRRC8 isoforms . LRRC8 - dependent Cl – and taurine fluxes indicated that VRAC is identical to VSOAC ( 6 ) and fit to a pore formed by LRRC8 hexamers , because hexameric pan - nexin channels likewise display poor substrate specificity ( 28 ) . Our results provide the basis to explore the structure - function relationship of VRAC / VSOAC , to clarify the signaling pathway that couples cell volume increase to channel opening , and to in - vestigate the role of the channel in basic cellular processes such as cell division , growth , and mi - gration and in various pathological states . Inter - estingly , a truncating LRRC8A mutation has been described in a patient with agammaglobulinemia ( 21 ) , and LRRC8C may have a role in fat metab - olism ( 31 ) . References and Notes 1 . E .

Winter , 1 * Miin - Feng Wu , 1 Yuri Kanno , 2 Ayako Yamaguchi , 1 Mitsunori Seo , 2 Doris Wagner 1 † The switch to reproductive development is biphasic in many plants , a feature important for optimal pollination and yield . We show that dual opposite roles of the phytohormone gibberellin underpin this phenomenon in Arabidopsis . Although gibberellin promotes termination of vegetative development , it inhibits flower formation . To overcome this effect , the transcription factor LEAFY induces expression of a gibberellin catabolism gene ; consequently , increased LEAFY activity causes reduced gibberellin levels . This allows accumulation of gibberellin - sensitive DELLA proteins . The DELLA proteins are recruited by SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN – LIKE transcription factors to regulatory regions of the floral commitment gene APETALA1 and promote APETALA1 up - regulation and floral fate synergistically with LEAFY . The two opposing functions of gibberellin may facilitate evolutionary and environmental modulation of plant inflorescence architecture . S ynchronization of the developmental tran - sitions that lead to reproductive compe - tence is important for species survival . Plants form new lateral organs iteratively through - out their life from the flanks of the shoot ap - ical meristem ( fig . S1 ) ( 1 , 2 ) . The type of the lateral organ produced depends on the phase of the life cycle . In Arabidopsis , rosette leaves are produced during the vegetative phase . Dur - ing the reproductive phase , an inflorescence forms . Not all lateral organ primordia of the inflorescence are competent to become flow - ers . Those that are not instead give rise to branches subtended by cauline leaves during the first inflorescence phase ( 3 , 4 ) . The dura - tion of the branch - producing first inflorescence phase determines inflorescence architecture and is critical for optimal seed set . To gain insight into the regulation of the tran - sition from branch to floral fate in the lateral primordia of the inflorescence , we analyzed pub - lic genome - wide binding and expression data and identified genes that aredirecttargetsof theLEAFY ( LFY ) transcription factor ( 5 – 7 ) ( table S1 ) . LFY promotes flower formation ( 8 , 9 ) . We identified for further study the EUI - LIKE P450 A1 ( ELA1 ) gene ( fig . S2 ) , which encodes a cytochrome P450 ( 10 ) . ELA1 expression was very low in vegetative tissues but increased when flowers formed ( fig . S3 ) . On the basis of in situ hybridization and reporter studies , ELA1 was initially expressed on the abaxial side of incipient flower primordia and later along their entire circumference ( Fig . 1A and fig . S3 ) . ELA1 expression was dependent on the 1 DepartmentofBiology , UniversityofPennsylvania , 415South University Avenue , Philadelphia , PA 19104 – 6018 , USA . 2 RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science , Yokohama , Kanagawa , 230 - 0045 , Japan . * Present address : Department of Biology , Duke University , Box 90338 , Durham , NC 27708 , USA . † Corresponding author .
