A peptide from this region ( CD2 : 322 – 339 ) isolated CMS ( human CD2AP ) ; a related protein , CIN85 ; and the actin capping protein , CAPZ from a T cell line . In BIAcore™ analyses , the N - terminal SH3 domains of CMS and CIN85 bound CD2 : 322 – 339 with similar disso - ciation constants ( K D (cid:1) (cid:1) 100 (cid:2) M ) . CAPZ bound the C - terminal half of CMS and CIN85 . Direct binding between CMS / CIN85 and CAPZ provides a link with the actin cytoskeleton . Overexpression of a fragment from the C - terminal half or the N - terminal SH3 domain of CD2AP in a mouse T cell hybridoma resulted in enhanced inter - leukin - 2 production and reduced T cell receptor down - modulation in response to antigen . These adaptor pro - teins are important in T cell signaling consistent with a role for CD2 in regulating pathways initiated by CMS / CIN85 and CAPZ . CD2 is a T and NK cell surface protein that mediates low affinity cell - cell interactions by binding to related immunoglob - ulin superfamily ( IgSF ) proteins , CD58 in humans and CD48 in rodents ( reviewed in Ref . 1 ) . In antigen - specific T cell activa - tion , the interaction between CD2 and its ligand contributes toward lowering the threshold of activation by TCR in antigen - specific responses ( 2 ) . Adhesion between the extracellular re - gions of CD2 and CD48 assists in the initial segregation of proteins in antigen - specific T cell activation ( 1 ) . However , re - cruitment of CD2 into the central contact zone during forma - tion of an immunological synapse is dependent on the cytoplas - mic tail of CD2 ( 3 ) . Among the proteins to which CD2 is related in its extracellular region ( 4 ) , CD2 has a unique mechanism of engagement of intracellular machinery based on proline - rich motifs . The membrane - distal region of the cytoplasmic tail contains the sequence HQQKGPPLPRPRVQPKPP , which is conserved in CD2 from many species . Deletion in this region impairs signaling events induced by CD2 mAbs 1 ( 5 ) . CD2AP isolated in a yeast two - hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic tail of CD2 contains three SH3 domains ( 3 ) . The N - terminal SH3 domain appeared to have a relatively high specificity and avid - ity for this conserved region of the CD2 cytoplasmic region ( 3 ) . In cells , a truncated protein containing only the two most N - terminal SH3 domains of CD2AP disrupted T cell polariza - tion , implicating CD2 in cytoskeletal rearrangement ( 3 ) . Anti - gen - specific engagement was required for proper cluster forma - tion by CD2 , leading to speculation as to whether CD2 regulates the cytoskeleton or vice versa ( 3 ) . There are data showing that other SH3 domains have the potential to bind the distal conserved region of CD2 ( 3 , 6 , 7 ) . CD2BP2 , a protein containing a novel GYF domain , is a candidate for interacting with a more membrane - proximal conserved motif PPPPGH , which is repeated exactly in human ( 8 ) . A molecular interaction has not yet been defined to explain the role of the distal end of the CD2 tail in enhancing the avidity for its cell surface ligand ( 9 ) . We identified proteins that interact with the CD2 cytoplas - mic region and show that there is a direct link through CMS and CIN85 with the actin capping protein , CAPZ . We show these proteins have a role in regulating signaling in T cells . MATERIALS AND METHODS Peptides— The peptides were synthesized with an N - terminal biotin ( Table I ) . CD2 peptide sequences are numbered according to Swissprot : P06729 . CD2 : 322 – 339 * was used in peptide pull - down experiments . Position 14 differs from Swissprot : P06729 . No difference in specificity of binding between CD2 : 322 – 339 * ( not shown ) and CD2 : 322 – 339 ( see Figs . 3 and 4 ) was observed in BIAcore TM experiments . Pull - down Experiments— The human T cell line Jurkat cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed at 10 8 / ml in 10 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 140 m M NaCl , 1 m M EDTA , 10 % glycerol , and 1 % Brij - 96 detergent .

Washed beads were resuspended in 10 (cid:1) l of Nu - PAGE SDS sample buffer ( Novex , San Diego , CA ) , reduced with 1 % ( w / v ) dithiothreitol , vortexed , and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min . The beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge , and supernatant was run on NuPAGE 4 – 12 % Bis - Tris gels ( Novex ) in an X - Cell II gel tank ( Novex ) using MOPS SDS running buffer ( Novex ) . The gels were stained with Coomassie , and the protein bands were excised from the gel and ana - lyzed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry ( 10 ) . After overnight trypsin digestion , the peptides were extracted twice with 30 (cid:1) l of 50 % acetonitrile , 5 % trifluoroacetic acid . Finally , the dried peptide solution was resuspended in 10 (cid:1) l of H 2 O . MALDI Mass Spectrometry— 0 . 5 (cid:1) l of saturated 2 , 5 - dihydroxyben - zoic acid in H 2 O was mixed on - target with 0 . 5 (cid:1) l of sample and dried . Peptide mass fingerprints were acquired on a REFLEX III mass spec - trometer ( Bruker Daltonics , Coventry , UK ) . The spectra were internally or externally calibrated ( Calibration Mixture 2 from a Sequazyme kit , Applied Biosystems , Warrington , UK ) . Data interpretation was carried out using the Prospector Suite of search programs ( prospector . ucsf . edu / ) . Peak lists from MALDI spectra were input into MS - Fit , and the NCBI nonredundant protein data base was searched . Constructs— Maltose - binding protein fusion proteins were con - structed using the pMAL - c2X vector ( www . neb . com ) . Templates CMS ( 11 ) and CIN85 ( 12 ) for amplification by PCR using cloned Pfu polym - erase were provided by K . Kirsch and S . Kaijigaya , respectively . The fragments were cloned in - frame into vector cut with Bam HI and Sal I . SH3 domains with 5 (cid:3) Bam HI and 3 (cid:3) Sal I sites lacked the initiator Met and contained a stop codon after the following C - terminal sequences CIN85 - SH3 , FVKLLPP ; CMS - SH3d1 , KEIKRE ; and CIN85 - SH3d1 , REIKKE . C - terminal regions were cloned using an engineered 5 (cid:3) Bam HI site for CIN85 - C , a natural Bgl II site for CMS - C , and a Xho I site after the stop codon producing the following N - terminal sequences after the junction with pMAL : CMS - CC , IVEALK ; CMS - C , SGTVYP ; and CIN85 - C , GALPPR . CD2BP1 - SH3 was amplified from human PBL cDNA and fused to pMAL , the sequence codons for SPAQEY following the Bam HI site and with a Sal I site after the stop codon . In the T cell hybridoma , PLEGFP - C1 ( www . clontech . com ) was used for expression of EGFP fused to CD2AP - C , a Hin dIII ( 1078 bp ) - Xho I ( 2426 bp ) restriction fragment of CD2AP ( M . Dustin and A . Shaw , St . Louis , MO ) , CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC ( CMS and CD2AP SH3d1 are identical , CD2AP terminology is used in the mouse experiments ) constructed in two steps using a 3 (cid:3) primer containing adjacent Bgl II and Hin dIII sites . The intermediate vector was cut with Bgl II and Sal I , and the CMS - CC fragment was inserted , which produced the joining sequence ERSIVE . CMS - CC was also inserted into pLEGFP - C1 to provide a dimeric EGFP control . A mouse CD2 pBabe construct was made by Anna Cambiaggi . Proteins— pMAL fusion proteins were expressed and affinity - purified using standard procedures with amylose resin ( www . neb . com ) . SH3 constructs were further purified by gel filtration using Superdex 75 ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Chicken CAPZ (cid:2) 1 (cid:3) 1 , which was the first CAPZ available to us was expressed using a construct provided by T . Obinata ( 13 ) and purified from bacterial lysates containing 0 . 15 M NaCl by ion exchange on Q Sepharose using a binding buffer containing 10 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 05 M NaCl and eluted with the same buffer and increasing NaCl concentration , with CAPZ eluting at about 0 . 4 M NaCl . A single peak containing the heterodimeric CAPZ was isolated by gel filtration on Superdex 200 . Human erythrocyte CAPZ was provided by P . Khulman ( 14 ) . Attempts to produce full - length CMS and CIN85 in bacteria as pMAL fusion proteins and in insect cells with a His - biotin tag were hampered by low level expression and degradation and not pursued . Confirmatory sequencing of all constructs was obtained using Big - Dye™ ( ABI ) Sanger dideoxynucleotide method on a Prism 377 DNA or 3100 Genetic Analyzer sequencer ( ABI ) . Purified proteins were ana - lyzed by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . The concentrations were estimated by absorption at 280 nm in a 1 - cm flow cell using theoretical extinction coefficients for the pMAL fusion proteins : CMS - SH3d1 (cid:4) 74 , 250 M (cid:5) 1 cm (cid:5) 1 and CIN85 - SH3d1 (cid:4) 77 , 380 M (cid:5) 1 cm (cid:5) 1 . Experimentally determined extinction coefficients determined in triplicate for CMS - SH3d1 ( 76 , 973 , 79 , 501 , and 88 , 107 M (cid:5) 1 cm (cid:5) 1 ) are similar to the theo - retical value . BIAcore Analysis— The experiments were carried out using a BIA - core 2000 at 25 and at 37 °C ( 15 , 16 ) for affinity measurements with SH3d1 proteins using buffers , anti - mouse Fc (cid:4) , and amine coupling to research grade CM5 chips ( BIAcore AB ) using flow rates of 10 (cid:1) l / min and for equilibrium binding 20 (cid:1) l / min . Chicken CAPZ mAbs 5B12 . 3 and 1E5 . 25 . 4 were obtained from Development Studies Hybridoma Bank ( www . uiowa . edu / (cid:1) dshbwww ) . Biotinylated peptide solutions were in - jected in HEPES - buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 , at 400 ng / ml over immobilized streptavidin ( 3000 – 4000 RU ) . CMS , CIN85 , and cCAPZ were directly immobilized by amine coupling in 10 m M NaAc buffer , pH 5 . 0 . The response units immobilized are in the relevant figure legends . An extra washing step after blocking with ethanolamine was avoided to avoid possible inactivation of immobilized material . For affinity measure - ments , 5 - (cid:1) l injections of increasing and decreasing concentrations of monomeric SH3d1 proteins were passed over immobilized peptides at 20 (cid:1) l / min at 37 °C , and the data were analyzed as described ( 15 , 16 ) . Antigen - specific T Cell Hybridoma assays— 2B4 mouse T cell hybrid - oma and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing mouse I - Ek were used as model T and antigen presenting cells , respectively , as described ( 17 ) . CD2 (cid:6) 2B4 T cell hybridoma cells were made by Anna Cambiaggi ( Oxford , UK ) using calcium phosphate transfection of the BOSC 293T packaging cell line , retroviral transduction , and selection using puro - mycin at 1 (cid:1) g / ml . Several clones were pooled to produce a polyclonal population . PLEGFP - C1 constructs were introduced into the CD2 (cid:6) and CD2 (cid:5) T cell hybridomas by retroviral transduction , with recombinant virus being produced by transfection using FuGENE ( Roche Applied Science ) into the Phoenix packaging cell line . Antigen - specific IL - 2 production and TCR down - modulation experiments were essentially as previously described ( 17 ) with the following differences . For both anti - gen stimulation and IL - 2 production , round bottomed plates were used in the initial experiments ( i . e . Fig . 6 ) , and subsequently , flat bottomed plates were used . To measure IL - 2 production , 8 , 000 HT2 cells ( 50 (cid:1) l ) were incubated with supernatants ( 50 (cid:1) l : usually 1 : 1 and 1 : 5 ) for 16 h followed by a 6 - h pulse with 0 . 8 – 1 (cid:1) Ci of [ 3 H ] thymidine . IL - 2 produc - tion of triplicate or quadruplicate cultures was calculated using a stand - ard of recombinant human IL - 2 and curve fitting in PRISM . Down - modulation experiments were initially carried out in plates , with triplicate cultures being pooled into one fluorescence - activated cell sorter tube ( Fig . 7 B ) , but subsequently the whole assay was performed in fluorescence - activated cell sorter tubes ( Fig . 7 C ) . Optimal staining was obtained using a three - step staining procedure with KT3 ( anti - mCD3 ) , biotinylated anti - rat Ig ( Jackson Labs ) , and Streptavidin - Quantum Red ( Sigma ) . The stained cells were fixed with 2 % paraform - aldehyde and read the following day . The median fluorescence was determined from cells gated for the same levels of EGFP . RESULTS CMS , CIN85 , and CAPZ Were Isolated from Jurkat Cell Lysates by CD2 Peptide 322 – 339— To identify proteins inter - acting with the cytoplasmic tail of CD2 , synthetic peptides were coupled to magnetic beads and used as an affinity matrix in “pull - down” experiments to purify associated proteins from extracts of the Jurkat T cell line . Four bands seen in analysis by SDS - PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining ( Fig . 1 ) with peptide CD2 : 322 – 339 but not with other peptides includ - ing CD2 : 281 – 305 ( data not shown ) were identified ( Table II ) . Band 2 represents CMS , the human homologue of CD2AP ( 11 ) . Band 1 is a closely related protein CIN85 ( 12 ) , which has the same overall structure as CMS . Bands 3 and 4 contained the (cid:2) and (cid:3) subunits of the actin capping protein , CAPZ . CAPZ (cid:2) exists in two closely related isoforms ( (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 2 ) that differ at T ABLE I Peptides Peptide name Peptide sequence Manufacturer CD2 : 322 – 339 * Biotin - QKGPPLPRPRVQPAPPHG - COOH Sigma - Genosys CD2 : 322 – 339 Biotin - QKGPPLPRPRVQPKPPHG - COOH Interactiva CD2 : 281 – 305 Biotin - HPPPPPGHRSQAPSHRPPPPGHRVQ - COOH Interactiva ICOS - P Biotin - DPNGEYMFMRAVNTAKKSRLTDVTL - COOH Interactiva CMS and CIN85 Bind CAPZ Linking CD2 to Actin 22397 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 7 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m the C termini ( 18 ) . Band 3 contained both CapZ (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 2 isoforms , because peptides unique to (cid:2) 1 and (cid:2) 2 were present ( Table II ) . Peptide data from band 4 matched the human CAPZ (cid:3) 2 subunit ( 19 ) ( Table II ) , which is the dominant isoform in nonmuscle cells ( 20 ) . CMS and CIN85 but Not CAPZ Bind Directly to CD2 : 322 – 339— Direct interaction between the mouse homologue of CMS , CD2AP , and the cytoplasmic region of CD2 contained in CD2 : 322 – 339 has been previously demonstrated ( 3 ) . The N - terminal SH3 domain of CD2AP mediated binding . Both this SH3 do - main and the CD2 : 322 – 339 peptide have identical sequences in mice and humans . To confirm that CMS was binding directly to CD2 : 322 – 339 via its N - terminal SH3 domain and to ask whether CIN85 had comparable specificity , we tested binding of recombinant forms of CMS - SH3d1 and CIN85 - SH3d1 ( Fig . 2 ) to peptides using a BIAcore™ . The N - terminal SH3 domains of CMS and CIN85 are the most similar , being 68 % identical . Care was taken to conduct experiments with monomeric mate - rial within hours of elution from a gel filtration column . CMS - SH3d1 was injected over immobilized peptide , and the data are shown for five concentrations in Fig . 3 A . CD2 : 281 – 305 , which did not bind pMAL fusion proteins containing all three SH3 domains of CMS ( not shown ) or CIN85 ( Figs . 2 and 4 A , inset ) , was used as a negative control peptide . CMS - SH3d1 bound to CD2 : 322 – 339 and not to CD2 : 281 – 305 ( Fig . 3 A ) . CIN85 - SH3d1 bound in a similar fashion ( Fig . 3 B ) The signals for CMS - SH3d1 and CIN85 - SH3d1 passing over the control CD2 : 281 – 305 are due simply to the high concentration of protein neces - sary for detection of weak interactions . Binding was characteristic of a low affinity monomeric interaction with rapid kinetics enabling a quantitative comparison between the two proteins to be made by calculating the K D from equilibrium binding values over a range of concentrations of soluble CMS or CIN85 SH3d1 ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . Fitting binding data to a nonlinear hyperbole and Scatchard analysis ( Fig . 3 , C and D , insets ) showed that CMS - SH3d1 and CIN85 - SH3d1 bound CD2 : 322 – 339 according to a Langmuir model and with similar dissociation constants , 105 and 76 (cid:1) M , i . e . in the order of 100 (cid:1) M . Duplicate sets of data gave comparable results : CMS , 76 (cid:1) M and CIN85 , 72 (cid:1) M . Slightly lower levels of immobilized peptide resulted in K D values of 129 and 127 (cid:1) M for 127 and 76 and 77 (cid:1) M for CIN85 . We did not detect in our pull - down experiments another SH3 domain containing protein , CD2BP1 , previously reported to interact with the region of CD2 covered by CD2 : 322 – 339 in either the absence or the presence of presence of 200 (cid:1) M Zn 2 (cid:6) ions ( 7 ) . This may have been due to the sensitivity of the assay , and this putative interaction was tested using purified mono - meric pMAL fusion protein containing the SH3 domain of CD2BP1 , CD2BP1 - SH3 ( Fig . 2 B , lane 4 ) . An interaction was detected at 37 °C , but levels of binding were low despite the high levels of peptide immobilized , and the interaction showed less specificity than CMS or CIN85 because CD2BP1 bound to both CD2 : 322 – 339 and CD2 : 281 – 309 peptides ( Fig . 3 E ) . In experiments using immobilized peptide levels that gave clear CMS - SH3 binding at 4 (cid:1) M , no binding was detectable with CD2BP1 - SH3 at 40 (cid:1) M even in the presence of 2 m M MgCl 2 ( data not shown ) . CAPZ does not contain domains that are known to bind proline - rich sequences ( 21 ) and was not predicted to bind di - rectly to the CD2 cytoplasmic tail . To distinguish between direct and indirect interactions , recombinant chicken CAPZ (cid:2) 1 (cid:3) 1 , which was available to us ( cCAPZ ; Fig . 2 B , lane 9 ) , CAPZ being highly conserved among species , was tested for interac - tion with CD2 peptides . Chicken CAPZ ( 46 (cid:1) M ) ( Fig . 2 ) did not bind CD2 peptides ( Fig . 3 F ) but was antigenically active be - cause it bound mAbs specific for either chicken CAPZ (cid:2) 1 and (cid:3) 1 ( Fig . 3 F , inset ) . CAPZ Binds the C - terminal Region of CMS and CIN85 but Not the Coiled - coil Region of CMS— The lack of binding of CD2 peptides by cCAPZ was consistent with CAPZ being associated with the CD2 peptide via CMS and / or CIN85 . The lack of proline - rich sequence in CAPZ suggested the mechanism of interaction between CAPZ and CIN85 or CMS would not in - volve the SH3 domains . This prediction was correct because CIN85 - SH3d1 – 3 did not bind to immobilized cCAPZ ( Fig . 4 A ) , whereas CIN85 - SH3d1 – 3 bound CD2 : 322 – 339 peptide ( inset ) . A C - terminal fragment of CMS ( CMS - C ; Fig . 2 , A and B , lane 6 ) was tested for interaction with immobilized cCAPZ . It bound avidly ( Fig . 4 B ) to cCAPZ but not to CD2 : 322 – 339 . This result with cCAPZ (cid:2) 1 (cid:3) 1 heterodimer shows that the interaction is not CAPZ (cid:3) isoform - specific because the human CAPZ ( hCAPZ ) identified in the pull - down experiments contained the (cid:2) 1 (cid:3) 2 heterodimer . The avid binding is consistent with CMS - C being dimeric as shown by gel filtration ( data not shown and Ref . 11 ) . CMS - C also bound directly to human CAPZ (cid:2) 1 (cid:3) 2 heterodimer ( Figs . 4 C and 2 B , lane 8 ) and not to CD2 : 322 – 339 . A motif ( VEALK ) within the coil - coil region of CMS known to self - associate ( 11 ) is also present in the C terminus of human CAPZ (cid:3) 2 , raising the possibility that this region mediated binding to CAPZ . However , the coiled - coil region of CMS , CMS - CC ( Fig . 2 , A and B , lane 5 ) , which formed a tetramer as described for CIN85 ( 22 ) demonstrating a capability to form higher order complexes , did not bind to CAPZ ( Fig . 4 C , inset ) . CIN85 - C ( Fig . 2 , A and B , lane 7 ) was also dimeric ( data not shown ) and bound immobilized hCAPZ with high avidity ( Fig . 4 D ) . In the reverse orientation , hCAPZ bound to immobilized CMS and CIN85 , showing that binding was not an artifact of CAPZ immobiliza - tion ( Fig . 4 , E and F ) . Thus CAPZ interacts through a discrete fragment of the CMS / CIN85 C - terminal region , which is dis - tinct from the upstream putative endophilin - binding sites ( 23 ) F IG . 1 .

Overexpression of the C - terminal Region of CD2AP Enhances Antigen - specific IL - 2 Production— The functional consequences of disrupting CMS / CIN85 binding to CAPZ and potentially a link between CD2 and the actin cytoskeleton were explored . Responses of a T cell hybridoma expressing mouse CD2 to antigen presented by Chinese hamster ovary cells with major histocompatibility complex class II on their surface were meas - ured ( 17 ) . For these experiments we used a C - terminal frag - ment of the mouse equivalent of CMS , CD2AP , to maintain optimal interactions in the murine hybridoma . The N - terminal SH3 domains of CMS and CD2AP are identical ; thus CMS - SH3d1 and CD2AP - SH3d1 are interchangeable , and for consis - tency in describing the functional experiments in mouse cells , we have used the nomenclature CD2AP - SH3d1 . Expression of retroviral constructs encoding EGFP fusion proteins was readily observed by microscopy in the packaging cell line where fluorescence of CD2AP - C ( Fig . 6 A ) and CMS - CC ( Fig . 6 B ) fu - sion proteins was consistent with localization at the plasma membrane in contrast to EGFP ( Fig . 6 C ) , which remained cytoplasmic . Membrane localization of CMS - CC is consistent with it mediating interactions either by its capacity to form tetramers or heterodimerization ( 24 ) . 2B4 T hybridoma cells expressing these constructs were produced and tested for com - parable levels of EGFP ( Fig . 6 D ) and CD3 ( Fig . 6 E ) . EGFP levels were high enough to quantitate by flow cytometry but very faint in microscopic examinations . The cells were then assayed for antigen - specific IL - 2 production ( Fig . 6 , F and G ) . Antigen dose response is shown in Fig . 6 F as [ 3 H ] thymidine incorporation to establish the criteria for subsequently compar - ing levels of IL - 2 production for one antigen concentration in T ABLE II Identities of bands 1 – 4 in Fig . 1 The bands were digested with trypsin and analysed by MALDI mass spectrometry .

Cells expressing CD2AP - C gave enhanced levels of IL - 2 in response to antigen and concanavalin A in contrast to cells expressing CMS - CC or EGFP ( Fig . 6 , F and G ) . The effects of CMS - CC relative to a high level of EGFP were marginal in contrast to CD2AP - C . In subsequent experiments CMS - CC was used as the sole control vector . Interactions of the N - terminal SH3 Domain of CD2AP Are Important in Regulating T Cell Signaling— It is the specific location of the CD2 - CD2AP ( or CIN85 ) interaction that will be important in the way CD2 utilizes this pathway in the cell . Thus it was essential to know whether disruption of binding to the N - terminal SH3 domain of CD2AP is significant . To di - rectly compare with the dimeric CD2AP - C , we constructed a dimeric form of CD2AP - SH3d1 by fusing it to the coiled - coil region of CMS . As expected based on the behavior of CMS - CC , CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC localized to the plasma membrane , as did constructs expressing CIN85 - SH3d1 - CC and CD2BP1 - SH3d1 - CC ( data not shown ) . Antigen - specific IL - 2 production was enhanced by expression of CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC relative to cells expressing CMS - CC ( Fig . 7 A ) . CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC had a significant effect , although with comparable levels of EGFP and CD3 ( data not shown ) , CD2AP - C was more effective than CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC in the enhancement of IL - 2 production ( Fig . 7 A ) . Overexpression of truncation mutants of CIN85 potenti - ates signaling by inhibiting receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 23 , 25 ) . Cells expressing EGFP fusion proteins of CD2AP - C , CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC , and , as a control , CMS - CC were compared for their effects on antigen - induced TCR down - modulation . The same trend was observed reproducibly ( Fig . 7 , B and C ) . Rela - tive effects on down - modulation were comparable with those observed for EGF receptor internalization in similar experi - ments ( 25 ) . CD2AP - C and CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC inhibited TCR down - modulation consistent with enhanced IL - 2 production being the result of prolonged signaling . As for results for IL - 2 production , in cells with comparable EGFP and CD3 levels , CD2AP - C appeared more effective than CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC . We did not observe a reproducible CD2 - dependent effect in IL - 2 production or TCR down - modulation between CD2 (cid:6) and CD2 (cid:5) T cell hybridoma cells ( data not shown ) . Comparisons were made using antigen presenting Chinese hamster ovary cells , which did not express CD48 to avoid the complication of the dominant effects of the CD2 - CD48 interaction . The re - sponses were enhanced only in CD2 (cid:6) cells when CD48 (cid:6) anti - gen presenting Chinese hamster ovary cells were used ( data not shown ) . Similar effects of CD2AP - SH3d1 - CC expression on IL - 2 production and TCR down - modulation were observed in CD2 (cid:6) and CD2 (cid:5) hybridoma cells ( data not shown ) . The dom - inant effects of adhesion between CD2 and CD48 reduced the relative effects of the EGFP fusion proteins in CD2 (cid:6) cells and did not assist in assessing a role for the CD2 cytoplasmic region . DISCUSSION The biochemical data presented here provide proof that there is a direct link between the cell surface receptor , CD2 , and the cytoskeleton via CAPZ , and this is shown schematically in Fig . 5 . CMS and CIN85 are widely expressed , and linkage to CAPZ has implications for a fundamental role in regulation of the cytoskeleton in many cell types not just in T cell triggering ( 11 , 12 , 26 ) . Direct interaction between CMS / CIN85 and CAPZ pro - vides a molecular basis for interpreting other biochemical data ( 24 ) and observations made on the localization of components of the actin cytoskeleton in cells ( 27 ) . CAPZ colocalizes with actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex in leading edges and in small spots of actin assembly in the lamella of motile cells ( 27 ) . A similar distribution of CMS ( 11 ) and CD2AP ( 30 ) has been demon - strated in transfected and normal cells , respectively . Unpub - lished data describing CAPZ and CD2AP colocalization are F IG . 5 . CMS and CIN85 bind CAPZ , providing a link between the cell surface protein CD2 and the actin cytoskeleton . F IG . 4 . CAPZ does not bind SH3 domains but does bind the C - terminal region of CMS . A , CIN85 - SH3 ( 0 . 5 (cid:1) M ) did not bind immobilized cCAPZ ( solid line ; 2507 RU ) or control streptavidin ( dashed line ; 1423 RU ) but does bind CD2 : 322 – 339 ( not shown ) . The inset shows CIN85 - SH3 ( 2 (cid:1) M ) binds to immobilized CD2 : 322 – 339 ( solid line ; 711 RU ) not CD2 : 281 – 305 ( dashed line ; 868 RU ) or ICOS - P ( dotted line ; 699 RU ) . B , CMS - C ( 1 . 3 (cid:1) M ) bound to immobilized cCAPZ ( 1742 RU ) but not to CD2 : 322 – 339 ( 150 RU ) or to a blank flow cell . C and D , CMS - C ( C ) and CIN85 - C ( D ) ( 1 . 3 (cid:1) M ) bound immobilized hCAPZ ( 4265 RU ) not CD2 : 322 – 339 ( 640 RU ) , whereas ( C , inset ) CMS - CC ( 1 . 1 (cid:1) M ) did not bind immobilized hCAPZ ( solid line ; 2425 RU ) or CD2 : 322 – 339 ( dashed line ; 640 RU ) . E and F , hCAPZ ( 0 . 42 (cid:1) M ) bound immobilized CMS - C ( E , solid line ; 1330 RU ) and CIN85 - C ( F , solid line ; 924 RU ) but not CD2 : 322 – 339 ( E and F , dashed lines ; 664 RU ) .

The interaction with CAPZ is common to CMS and CIN85 in contrast to claims of direct binding of actin by CMS ( 28 ) and not CIN85 ( 29 ) . Comparable affinities of two structurally related proteins for the highly conserved region of the CD2 cytoplasmic tail support a model for building complex networks as against linear sig - naling in response to a single input signal ( 31 ) if CMS and CIN85 coupled to different downstream effectors . The affinities of CMS - SH3d1 and CIN85 - SH3d1 for CD2 : 322 – 339 peptide at a K D level of (cid:1) 100 (cid:1) M are at the lower end of the range reported for other synthetic peptides binding to SH3 domains ( 21 , 32 ) . A low affinity may be an advantage in responding quickly to changes in the micro - environment ( 31 ) . Given the broad distri - bution of CMS and CIN85 ( 11 , 12 , 26 ) , specificity of any in vivo interaction with CD2 appears to be determined by the distri - bution of CD2 . F IG . 6 .

Raw data are shown in F , and IL - 2 production calculated from the linear part of the IL - 2 response curve is shown in G . Inset in F , enhanced IL - 2 production was also observed in response to concanavalin A . F IG . 7 . Interactions of the N - terminal SH3 domain of CD2AP are important in regulating T cell signaling , and the mechanism involves TCR down - modulation .

Two ( of (cid:8) 5 ) representative experiments are shown . CMS and CIN85 Bind CAPZ Linking CD2 to Actin 22401 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 7 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m The N - terminal domains of CMS and CIN85 clearly have a greater affinity for CD2 than other candidates ( 3 , 6 , 7 , 29 ) . Other candidates include CD2BP1 , which is restricted to he - matopoietic tissue , in particular T and NK cells , which express CD2 ( 7 ) . We showed that the SH3 domain of CD2BP1 does have some capacity to bind CD2 : 322 – 339 but that it has a much weaker affinity for the peptide than CMS and CIN85 , it showed less specificity , and its significance is debatable ( 33 ) . An inter - action between the region of CD2 encompassed by CD2 : 322 – 339 and other SH3 domains has been previously reported ( 3 , 6 ) , and although monomeric affinities were not measured at 37 °C , relative levels of binding with GST fusion proteins indicated that CD2 : 322 – 339 had a marked preference for CD2AP ( 3 , 6 ) . Ligands for the N - terminal SH3 domain of CMS and CIN85 have not been identified in cells lacking CD2 , but their exist - ence is implied from functional data discussed below . CD2AP binds the cytoplasmic region of the cell surface receptor , neph - rin through a different mechanism involving the C - terminal region of CD2AP ( 34 ) . The second N - terminal SH3 domains of CMS and CIN85 are crucial for binding c - Cbl ( 12 , 35 ) . CAPZ is involved in control of actin polymerization and as - sociated functions and for instance is essential for Listeria movement ( 36 ) . A reduction in CAPZ concentration will reduce the rate of treadmilling and thus slow the rate of actin move - ment ( 36 ) . However , filament length is not accounted for by a simple treadmilling model leading to speculation that CAPZ is regulated in vivo ( 37 – 39 ) . CMS and CIN85 have been reported to bind various other intracellular proteins in a manner that can be regulated ( 11 , 12 , 22 , 35 , 40 ) , thus through interaction with the multiple protein binding motifs and domains in CMS and CIN85 there are multiple possibilities for regulating CAPZ activity . The phenotype of the CD2AP ( mouse CMS ) - deficient mouse is consistent with a role of CD2AP in regulating move - ment because podocytes do not form properly in the knockout mouse ( 26 ) . Disruption of interactions , which include the link with the actin cytoskeleton through the C - terminal regions of these adaptor proteins leads to loss of regulation of receptor signal - ing . Antigen - specific responses in a T cell hybridoma were enhanced by expression of the C - terminal region or N - terminal SH3 domain of CD2AP . A corresponding reduction in TCR down - modulation indicates a mechanism reported recently for receptors on other cell types ( 23 , 25 ) . A similar approach to perturbing CIN85 function resulted in potentiated signaling caused by a loss of receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 23 , 25 ) . The role ascribed to CIN85 in receptor - mediated endocytosis is at - tributed to its association with endophilin ( 23 , 25 ) . Interest - ingly the EGFP - CD2AP - C protein did not contain the putative endophilin site that is conserved between CD2AP ( CMS ) and CIN85 ( 23 ) ; thus interactions of the more distal region of these proteins are important in receptor internalization . Interfering with binding to the N - terminal SH3 domain had a marked effect on adaptor - regulated receptor internalization ( Fig . 7 and Ref . 25 ) . However , a role for CD2 in the pathways initiated by CMS / CIN85 and CAPZ in regulating TCR signal - ing has not yet been defined . Hyper - responsiveness has been observed in CD2 - deficient mice where thymocytes are more readily positively selected ( 42 , 43 ) , which could also be ex - plained by a failure to down - regulate TCR . Failure to down - regulate TCR has indeed been observed in T cells from CD2 - deficient mice ( 2 ) . The difficulty in interpreting these experiments in models using CD2 - deficient mice is distinguish - ing between the effects on extracellular and intracellular in - teractions of CD2 . This is avoided in the model of transgenic mice expressing human CD2 , which is not engaged by endog - enous CD48 so that effects can be directly attributed to the cytoplasmic region ( 44 ) . However , comparisons between TCR down - modulation in TCR transgenic mice null , heterozygous , or homozygous for a single copy of human CD2 ( 44 ) did not reveal a consistent trend . 2 Discerning a role for CD2 in the pathways initiated by CMS / CIN85 and CAPZ will require a more refined assay system . The key to understanding why CD2 has hijacked this general cell biological mechanism in a T cell will be its effect on local - ization of CMS ( CD2AP ) and CIN85 . Concentration of CD2 at the contact site between a T cell and an antigen presenting cell is initially dependent on the optimal size of the complex it forms with its cell surface ligand , thus aiding in recruiting CD2AP ( 41 ) . This supports a model in which CD2 influences the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . The CD2AP - CD2 interaction is enhanced on cell activation ( 3 ) , providing a mo - lecular explanation for earlier observations where cross - linking CD2 with mAbs led to immobilization of CD2 indicative of an interaction with the cytoskeleton ( 45 ) . Cross - linking with CD2 mAbs provided evidence that perturbation of CD2 can affect the activity of actin - associated proteins as it resulted in cofilin dephosphorylation and translocation ( 46 ) . However , the effects of cross - linking CD2 by mAbs are dependent on engagement of a classical signaling receptor ( 47 ) . Thus the dependence of CD2 reorganization on engagement of TCR by antigen can be inter - preted as regulation of CD2 distribution by the cytoskeleton ( 3 ) . This latter scenario is more in keeping with the model proposed for CD43 where there are clear data showing cytoskeleton - dependent relocation of CD43 ( 48 ) . Either way , whether a cell surface receptor regulates the cytoskeleton or it is the other way around , a link between CD2 and actin via CMS / CIN85 and CAPZ provides a firm molecular basis for a mechanism .
