Lionnet @ nyulangone . org Abstract The transfer of regulatory information between distal loci on chromatin is thought to involve physical proximity , but key biophysical features of these contacts remain unclear . For instance , it is unknown how close and for how long two loci need to be in order to productively interact . The main challenge is that it is currently impossible to measure chromatin dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution at scale . Polymer simulations provide an accessible and rigorous way to test biophysical models of chromatin regulation , yet there is a lack of simple and general methods for extracting the values of model parameters . Here we adapt the Nelder - Mead simplex optimization algorithm to select the best polymer model matching a given Hi - C dataset , using the MYC locus as an example . The model’s biophysical parameters predict a compartmental rearrangement of the MYC locus in leukemia , which we validate with single - cell measurements . Leveraging trajectories predicted by the model , we find that loci with similar Hi - C contact frequencies can exhibit widely different contact dynamics . Interestingly , the frequency of productive interactions between loci exhibits a non - linear relationship with their Hi - C contact frequency when we enforce a specific capture radius and contact duration . These observations are consistent with recent experimental observations and suggest that the dynamic ensemble of chromatin configurations , rather than average contact matrices , is required to fully predict long - range chromatin interactions . Main text Introduction The three - dimensional organization of the genome plays an important role in regulating gene expression by constraining long - range regulatory communication , for instance between promoters and enhancers ( 1 ) . In proximity ligation - based methods such as Hi - C , two main genomic structures are apparent ( 2 ) : Topologically Associating Domains ( TADs ) , which are regions with high interaction frequency , and thus appear as squares around the diagonal in contact frequency matrices ; and large A and B compartments , which are regions that preferentially interact with alternating regions but not neighbors , and thus appear as a checkerboard pattern in contact frequency matrices . On one hand , TADs constitute an emergent property of the chromatin fiber resulting from dynamic loop extrusion by Loop Extrusion Factors ( LEFs ) , such as cohesin ( 3 ) , and are bound by CTCF ( CCCTC - binding factors ) binding sites ( 4 - 6 ) . On the other hand , compartments largely correlate with alternating heterochromatin and euchromatin domains ( 7 ) . Simulations combining polymer dynamics , loop extrusion by LEFs with fixed boundaries , and weak attractive domain interactions accurately describe genome organization , including compartments ( 3 , 8 ) and their dynamics ( 9 , 10 ) . These simulations enable quantitative exploration of the mechanisms driving chromatin folding . Yet , given an experimental Hi - C dataset , there is a lack of simple and general methods to unbiasedly extract the parameter values of the corresponding polymer model . Recent work has compared experiments to a series of simulations based on a grid sweep of the parameters . Such a sweep provides an unbiased mapping of parameter space but is computationally costly ( 10 ) . Others have used machine learning to find the parameters for the weak attractive domain interactions . However , determining the parameters for loop extrusion still requires systematically testing hundreds of parameter sets based on prior knowledge of CTCF binding ( 8 ) . Here , leveraging a polymer model that combines loop extrusion and domain interactions ( 3 ) , we adapted the Nelder - Mead simplex optimization algorithm to build a method that can find the polymer parameters that best describe any input Hi - C data . We validated our strategy using in silico ground truth , published datasets featuring established biological perturbations , and DNA FISH data . Leveraging the temporal trajectories of chromatin generated by our simulations , we show that similar loci pairs with similar Hi - C contact frequencies can nonetheless exhibit dramatically different chromatin dynamics . Enforcing a specific capture radius and minimum duration for long - range communication , we show that long - range regulation varies non - linearly with Hi - C contact frequency across a range of plausible parameters . Materials and methods Cell Culture Human peripheral blood CD4 + T cells were bought from Lonza ( Lot No . 18TL156140 ) and thawed following the manufacturer’s protocol . The T cells were then cultured in RPMI media ( Corning , # 10 - 040 - CV ) supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen ; 10082147 ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; 15 - 140 - 122 ) , 1x glutamax ( Fisher Scientific ; 35 - 050 - 061 ) , 1x non - essential amino acids ( Fisher Scientific ; 11 - 140 - 050 ) , 1x sodium pyruvate ( Thermo Scientific ; 11360070 ) , 1x beta - mercaptoethanol ( Thermo Scientific ; 21985023 ) , and 30 U / ml IL2 ( PeproTech ; # 212 - 12 ) . CUTLL1 cells are a gift from the Aifantis lab . The cell line was cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin . Imaging Sample Preparation Cells were spun down to polylysine ( Sigma - Aldrich ; A - 005 - C ) coated slides using a Thermo Scientific Cytospin 4 centrifuge at 1250 rpm for 5 min . Cells were then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ; # 15713 , diluted in PBS ) at 4 °C overnight . After rinsing once with 1x PBS ( Fisher Scientific 14 - 190 - 250 ) , cells were permeabilized with 0 . 5 % TritonX - 100 ( Bio - Rad # 1610407 , diluted in PBS ) for 15 min at room temperature . Cells were rinsed again with PBS . The slides were used immediately for subsequent processes or stored in PBS at 4 °C overnight . DNA FISH Custom DNA FISH probes were ordered from Arbor Biosciences ( sequences in Supp . Table 1 ) . To label DNA FISH probes , dual - HPLC purified , amino - modified oligos were obtained from IDT and labeled by incubation with NHS esters conjugated with Cy3 ( Cytiva PA13101 ) or Cy5 ( Cytiva PA15101 ) in 0 . 1 M sodium carbonate buffer ( pH 9 . 0 ) overnight . Labeled oligos were purified with QIAquick nucleotide removal kit ( Qiagen ; # 28304 ) and used as reverse transcription primers . Probe labeling and DNA FISH were performed following the manufacturer’s protocol . The probes were resuspended in nuclease - free water at 0 . 07 ng / uL , and PCR amplified with KapaHiFi Hotstart Readymix ( Fisher Scientific KK2601 ) . Following PCR , a debubbling mix ( 10 uL KapaHiFi Hotstart Readymix , 1 . 2 uL myTag PCR primer mix , and 8 . 8 uL nuclease - free water ) was added to the sample and incubated in a thermocycler with the following program : 1 ) 95 °C 3 min , 2 ) 98 °C 20 s , 3 ) 54 °C 15 s , 4 ) 72 °C 30 s , 5 ) repeat steps 2 - 4 one time . The product was purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( Qiagen ; # 28104 ) and eluted in 30 uL of nuclease - free water . To obtain single - stranded DNA FISH probes , after PCR purification , probes were in vitro transcribed with the MEGAshortscript T7 kit ( ThermoFisher AM1354 ) for 4 h at 37 °C and purified with RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ; # 74104 ) . Following the in vitro transcription , the probes were reverse transcribed with Superscript IV Reverse Transcriptase ( ThermoFisher 18090010 ) . 52 ug in vitro transcription product and 2 nmoles labeled oligo were vacuum dried with Eppendorf Vacufuge Plus and resuspended in 44 uL nuclease - free water . The mixture was then combined with 15 uL 10 mM dNTPs ( New England Biolabs ; # N0447S ) and 1 uL SUPERase - In ( ThermoFisher AM2696 ) and incubated at 65 °C for 5 min . Then the mixture was combined with 6 . 5 uL nuclease - free water , 20 uL reverse transcription buffer , 10 ul 0 . 1 M DTT ( Invitrogen ; # 1949355 ) , 1 uL SUPERase - In , and 2 . 5 uL reverse transcriptase and incubated at 50 °C for 3 h . 11 uL Exonuclease I Buffer and 2 uL Exonuclease I ( New England Biolabs ; M0293S ) was added following reverse transcription and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min . Then 12 uL 0 . 5 M EDTA ( Invitrogen ; # 00486682 ) was added and incubated at 80 °C for 20 min , and the reverse transcription product was purified with Quick - RNA Miniprep Kit ( Zymo ; # R1054S ) . The probes were then digested with 4 uL RNaseH ( New England Biolabs M0297S ) and 4 uL RNaseA ( Thermo Scientific ; EN0531 ) in RNaseH buffer using the following program : 37 °C 2 h , 70 °C 20 min , 50 °C 1 h , 95 °C 5 min , ramp down to 50 °C at 0 . 1 °C / sec , 50 °C 1 h . Following digestion , the probes were purified again with Quick - RNA Miniprep Kit . DNA FISH slides were incubated in 20 % glycerol ( Fisher Bioreagent ; # 172572 , diluted in PBS ) for 30 min , frozen in liquid nitrogen for 30 s , and thawed for 1 min at room temperature . The slides were again incubated in 20 % glycerol for 20 min , frozen in liquid nitrogen for 30 s , and thawed for 1 min at room temperature . The slides were then incubated for 5 min in 0 . 1 N HCl ( Fisher Scientific ; S25354 ) and washed with 2xSSC ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 11666681001 ) 3 times , 1 min each . Then the slides were incubated for 30 min in hybridization buffer ( 30 % formamide , Thermo Fisher Scientific ; 15 - 515 - 026 ; 5xSSC , 9 mM Citric Acid , Sigma - Aldrich ; 251275 - 500G and MKCF6319 , pH 6 . 0 ; 0 . 1 % Tween20 ; 1x Denhardt’s Solution ; 40 % Dextran Sulfate , Sigma - Aldrich ; 42867 - 5G ; 0 . 4 mg / mL BSA ) at 37 °C . 10 pmol probes were diluted in hybridization buffer , incubated for 5 min at 70 °C , added to the slides , incubated at 85 °C for 5 min , and hybridized overnight in a 37 °C humidified chamber . The slides were then washed twice for 30 min with probe wash buffer ( 30 % formamide , 5x SSC , 9 mM Citric Acid pH 6 . 0 , 0 . 1 % Tween20 ) at 37 °C and twice 5 min with 5x SSCT ( SSC + 0 . 1 % Tween20 ) at room temperature . Finally , the slides were rinsed with 0 . 5 ug / mL DAPI ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 32670 - 5MG - F ) in 1xPBS , mounted in ProLong Gold ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; P36930 ) and sealed with nail polish the next day ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ; # 72180 ) . Image Acquisition Slides were imaged on a customized , MicroManager - controlled ( 11 , 12 ) , epi - fluorescent Nikon microscope equipped with a Chameleon camera , using a 100x oil - immersion lens ( NA = 1 . 4 ) . 10 - 15 image stacks were captured per sample with voxel size 73x73x250 nm . Slides were imaged using three channels : 405 ( DAPI ) , 532 ( Cy3 ) , and 637 nm ( Cy5 ) excitation lasers . Image Analysis We first estimated the locations of the centroids of DNA FISH signals using AirLocalize ( 13 ) , eliminating double detections . We then cropped out a small 3D region around each approximate centroid , and subtracted the surrounding background intensity . We determined the centroid of each locus as the center of mass of the intensity distribution using the meshgrid function . We matched centroids from different channels if they shared the same nuclear mask ( generated with CellProfiler ( 14 ) ) and were mutual nearest neighbors , and calculated their mutual distance . Cells were categorized into G1 or G2 phase based on the number of FISH spots ; one or two for G1 , three or four for G2 . Cells with no spots or more than four spots were excluded from the analysis . Matlab code ( https : / / www . mathworks . com / ) is available on GitHub : https : / / github . com / timotheelionnet / DNAFISH _ analysis Polymer Simulations Polymer simulations combining Langevin dynamics and loop extrusions were adapted from a previous publication ( 3 ) . TAD boundary monomers were assigned two permeabilities , corresponding respectively to the probability of stopping a LEF moving forward ( stallL ) or backward ( stallR ; Fig . 1 C and Supp . Fig . 1 A ) . The interaction potential between monomers consists of a short - range repulsive hard core enforcing impenetrability , followed by an attractive well at intermediate distances . The well depth is set to the attractive energy E attr , a value specific to each TAD ( Fig . 1 D and Supp . Fig . 1 A ) . We set the well radius and hard core repulsion energy to values that recapitulate typical compartmental checkerboard patterns and kept them fixed throughout ( Table 1 ) . We optimized the simulation duration to streamline the parameter search ( Supp . Fig . 1 B ) : based on the decay of the autocorrelation function of the simulated structures ( Supp . Fig . 1 C ) , we saved structures every 300 blocks , and reset the positions of loop extrusion factors every 600 blocks ; each block consists of a LEF position update ( each LEF moves by one monomer or dissociates / reloads ) , followed by 250 Langevin dynamics iterations . Each simulation consisting of 10 parallel replicates takes < 30 min on 10 GPUs . To define the initial guess , we systematically adjusted the parameters one by one ( E attr at 0 . 1 interval , stallL / R at 0 . 25 interval for each TAD / boundary ) while keeping others at a fixed value . The best - fits from manual systematic adjusting were used as the initial guess for simplex . The simplex leverages the Nelder - Mead method ( https : / / docs . scipy . org / doc / scipy / reference / optimize . minimize - neldermead . html ) as implemented in the scipy . optimize package ( https : / / docs . scipy . org / doc / scipy / reference / optimize . html ) . To build contact frequency maps , we assigned contact between monomer pairs lying within a given distance threshold , set to 420 nm in best - fits ( matching the lower resolution of HindIII Hi - C input data ( 15 , 16 ) ) , and 200 nm for the dynamic trajectories ( matching the increased resolution of recent experiments using MboI capture - C ( 15 , 17 ) ) . We measured the similarity between simulated contact frequency maps and Hi - C maps using Spearman Correlation . The simulation code is available on Github : https : / / github . com / yf1037 / ChromatinSimulation Dynamic simulation To follow dynamics , we saved structure coordinates every five blocks . We converted simulation block units to minutes by comparing the temporal scaling of the mean squared displacement of monomers with published data ( 3 ) . Hi - C Data Analysis We downloaded CTCF mutant Hi - C data ( 18 ) from the GEO accession viewer ( GSM4041374 , GSM4041375 ) , and processed them with Hi - C Bench ( 19 ) ( https : / / github . com / NYU - BFX / hic - bench / ) using default settings at 40 kb bin size . T - ALL ( 16 ) data were previously analyzed using Hi - C Bench ( 19 ) . All coordinates are mapped to hg19 . Significance tests We estimated statistical significance between Cumulative Distribution Functions using two - sample , one - sided Kolmogorov - Smirnov tests . All other statistical tests used a two - tailed student t - test . To test the sensitivity of Nelder - Mead simplex optimization , we estimated the standard deviation of optimizations based on 8 repeated optimizations of CTCFmut data ( Supp . Fig . 1 E ) . We then set means of optimizations at a given difference , e . g . means at 0 . 4 and 0 . 6 for StallL = 0 . 2 , and simulated optimization results based on a normal distribution . Then , we calculated the probability of observing a significant difference using the simulated optimization results . Results A parameter optimization algorithm predicts the contributions of loop extrusion and domain interactions from Hi - C maps The simulations leverage an established polymer model ( 3 ) combining the following ingredients : 1 ) Polymer dynamics based on a Rouse Model and Langevin dynamics ; 2 ) Loop extrusion using possessive LEFs that are stochastically loaded onto the chromatin fiber ( Fig . 1 C and Supp . Fig . 1 A ) ( TAD boundaries are set to discrete locations matching Hi - C TAD boundaries and assigned two directional permeabilities for LEFs : StallL , StallR ) ; and 3 ) domain interactions via attractive interactions between monomers , modeled by a potential well whose depth ( attraction energy , E attr ) quantifies mutual affinity ( Fig . 1 D and Supp . Fig . 1 A ) . To search for the best - fit parameter set for the loci of interest ( StallL , StallR , E attr for each boundary / domain ) , we start the optimization with an initial guess set of biophysical parameters ( see Methods ) and conduct a series of polymer simulation replicates ( Supp . Fig . 1 B ) . These simulations are combined to build a simulated Hi - C map in which pairs of monomers closer than a distance threshold are scored as making contact . We then measure the Spearman Correlation between the simulated Hi - C map and the experimental Hi - C map ( Fig . 1 A ) . Using the Nelder - Mead simplex optimization algorithm ( Fig . 1 B ) , we update the parameter values to find the parameter set maximizing the Spearman Correlation . We first validated the optimization method using ground truth maps built from simulation runs with known biophysical parameters . After typically 70 - 90 iterations , the Nelder - Mead algorithm converges close to the expected parameters ( Fig . 1 E - J ) . Since CTCF binding blocks loop extrusion ( 18 , 20 ) , simulations should predict a loss of boundary permeability when CTCF is perturbed . To validate whether simulations recapitulate known biology using experimental data , we leveraged recent Hi - C maps captured on a cell line homozygously expressing a CTCF mutant missing zinc fingers 9 - 11 ( CTCFmut ) ( 18 , 20 ) . Cells expressing CTCFmut lose a subset of CTCF binding , resulting in chromatin rearrangements visible in Hi - C maps . We optimized parameters for one of the rearranged loci against Hi - C contact frequency maps measured in the WT and CTCFmut ( chr3 : 59 , 800 , 000 - 61 , 840 , 000 ) ( Fig . 1 K ) . As expected , the simulation predicted a significant drop of 0 . 13 in boundary permeability in CTCFmut compared to WT ( Fig . 1 L ) , but no significant changes in E attr ( Fig . 1 M ) . We repeated the optimization eight times ( Supp . Fig . 1 D ) to calibrate the sensitivity and specificity of the simulations against experimental data ( Supp . Fig . 1 E ) . Since the simulation contains stochastic components , we quantified the sensitivity to small changes ( see Methods ) . With three independent optimization runs , there is a 70 % chance of finding a significant difference in boundary permeability StallL between two simulated maps if the change is 0 . 2 or greater ( Supp . Fig . 1 F ) . For E attr , the chance of finding a significant difference with a change of 0 . 1 k B T is 90 % with three optimizations ( Supp . Fig . 1 G ) . While the sensitivity further increases with the number of runs , the specificity is very high ( low false positive rates ) even with only two optimization runs . The rearrangement of the MYC locus in leukemia cells is consistent with changes in E attr Having established our parameter optimization approach , we went on to test whether it can formulate mechanistic predictions . We used the pathogenetic chromatin rearrangements at the MYC locus in leukemia as a model ( 16 ) , and ran an optimization search for the biophysical parameters yielding best agreement between simulated and previously published Hi - C contact frequency maps of T - ALL ( T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ) patient samples , the model leukemia cell line CUTLL1 ( Columbia University T cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma 1 ) , and naive T cells from healthy donors ( Fig . 2 . A ) . Loss of CTCF binding at the boundary of the MYC - containing TAD ( TAD boundary 3 ) in leukemia samples ( 16 ) suggests that a disruption in loop extrusion boundary could explain the observed changes in chromatin organization . In order to investigate whether loop extrusion changes alone could explain chromatin rearrangements , we ran the optimization using loop extrusion biophysical parameters only while omitting domain interactions . We separately ran optimizations to find the parameter values best describing Hi - C data from CUTLL1 or naive T cells . To our surprise , both optimizations converged to the same set of biophysical parameters , failing to recapitulate the distinct organization of the locus in T cells ( Fig . 2 . B ; Spearman Correlation : 0 . 79±0 . 01 for CUTLL1 , 0 . 67±0 . 02 for T cells ) . Since loop extrusion alone appeared insufficient to explain the difference between the MYC locus structures of T cells and CUTLL1 , we turned to the full model which includes both loop extrusion and E attr . With this model , we were able to obtain distinct Hi - C maps for the two conditions , each in agreement with its experimental counterpart ( Spearman Correlation : 0 . 87±0 . 05 for CUTLL1 , 0 . 84±0 . 07 for T cells , 0 . 93±0 . 03 for T - ALL ; Fig . 2 . C ) , regardless of the values of the parameters chosen to initialize the simplex ( Supp . Fig . 1 I ) . In naive T cells , the best - fit exhibits stronger E attr between the TADs upstream ( TAD2 ) and downstream ( TAD4 ) of the MYC - containing TAD , compared to the same parameters in CUTLL1 and T - ALL ( Fig . 2 D , Supp . Fig . 1 H ) . In other words , TAD2 and TAD4 preferentially interact with one another , but are segregated from the MYC - containing TAD3 in T cells . Interestingly , TAD4 super - enhancers are active in CUTLL1 ; the E attr disruption in leukemia could result in a TAD4 more permissive to promoter contacts ( 16 ) . To further confirm that changes in E attr but not boundary permeability underlie MYC rewiring , we generated contact frequency maps using a series of simulations set to different boundary permeabilities but keeping E attr constant , either set to the weak value observed in CUTLL1 ( Fig . 2 E ) or the strong value observed in T cells ( Supp . Fig . 1 J ) . None of these simulated maps correlate with the T cell data better than the one with high E attr . Moreover , those with low boundary permeabilities correlate better than those with high boundary permeabilities . Together , these results suggest that changes in loop extrusion alone can’t explain the differences between CUTLL1 and naive T cells . Single - cell chromatin structures are consistent with E attr disruption at the MYC locus in leukemia While contact frequency maps provide an informative readout of the average 3D organization of a locus , they are blind to the rich ensemble of conformations explored by chromatin ( 21 ) . Polymer simulations , on the other hand , do sample the conformation ensemble : they not only predict the average organization of a locus , but also its variability across time and replicates , which should reflect the heterogeneity observed across cells . Having validated that the simulated MYC locus provides a realistic model of the average locus organization , we went on to test whether the ensemble of simulated structures recapitulates the heterogeneity in 3D organization measured in single cells . Simulations of the full model at the MYC locus predict that TAD2 and TAD4 are further apart in CUTLL1 than in T cells . In contrast , simulations of T cells where we only allow a gain of a loop extrusion boundary relative to the CUTLL1 best - fit ( i . e . enforcing that E attr remains constant ) do not lead to a substantial change in the inter - TAD distance ( Fig . 3 A ) . We performed DNA FISH using probes tiling the two TADs in distinct colors and measured the distances between each TAD centroid in either cell type ( Fig . 3 B , C , Supp . Fig . 2 A - C ) , confirming the simulation predictions that TAD2 and TAD4 are on average further apart in CUTLL1 compared to T cells ( p = 4 ✕ 10 - 12 , two - sample one - sided Kolmogorov Smirnov test ) . This agreement suggests that the differences between CUTLL1 and naive T cells are caused by E attr changes but not loop extrusion . Importantly , not just the average distances , but the shape of the distance distribution across individual cells closely matches the predictions of the simulations in both cell types , further confirming that the simulations can predict heterogeneity across cells . The faster cell cycle of CUTTL cells might constitute a possible confounder if the MYC locus confirmation is strongly cell cycle - dependent . To eliminate this possibility , we assigned individual CUTLL1 cells to distinct cell cycle stages according to the number of visible DNA FISH spots per nucleus ( see Methods ) . The interTAD distances in G1 and G2 stages exhibit similar cumulative probability distributions ( Supp . Fig . 2 . D ) , suggesting that changes in E attr rather than differences in cell cycle phases explain the MYC rearrangement in leukemia cells . Pairs of loci with the same contact probability exhibit dramatically different looping dynamics Because polymer simulations recapitulate complex chromatin organization features , from sensitivity to key perturbations ( 3 ) to single - cell distributions ( 8 ) and dynamic chromatin behavior ( 10 , 22 ) , we reasoned that they might help investigate how the chromatin dynamic ensemble relates to average contact frequency maps , a widely used observable . Using the best - fit to the MYC locus in CUTLL1 as a testing ground , we simulated chromatin temporal trajectories to characterize how dynamics shape the interactions of the MYC promoter with its surroundings ( Fig . 4 A and B ) . While the MYC locus constitutes a realistic chromatin landscape within which we explore general principles driving long - range interactions , we stress that we do not intend here to recapitulate the specifics of MYC expression regulation . We first selected two loci with similar contact frequencies to the MYC promoter in simulated Hi - C data ( monomer 859 and 1590 , respectively located 120 kbp and 1 . 9 Mbp downstream of the MYC promoter at monomer 811 ; Fig . 4 B ) . Surprisingly , simulated contacts ( < 200 nm ) between the promoter and either locus exhibited very distinct dynamics : contacts with monomer 859 are short and frequent , while contacts with monomer 1590 are long but infrequent ( Fig . 4 C and Supp . Fig . 3 A ) . We hypothesized that the long infrequent promoter contacts of monomer 1590 are driven by loop extrusion , while the frequent short promoter contacts of monomer 895 are mediated by the thermal motion of the chromatin fiber . Indeed , decreasing the density of LEFs on chromatin threefold results in minimal effects on the dynamics of promoter contacts with close monomers , but significantly impacts the dynamics of promoter contacts with far away monomers ( Fig . 4 D and Supp . Fig . 3 B ) . We also tested perturbing the lifetime of LEFs on chromatin which again impacted the contacts with monomers far away from the promoter but not those with closeby monomers ( Supp . Fig . 3 B ) . These findings illustrate that Hi - C contact frequency has limited power to predict looping dynamics . Time - and distance - gating regulate chromatin contacts non - linearly The transcription output of a reporter gene exhibits a sigmoidal response to the frequency of contacts between its promoter and a distal enhancer , as measured by Hi - C ( 17 , 23 ) , although the molecular mediators of this relationship remain unknown . Cross - linking used in Hi - C likely captures transient contacts because DNA binders that reside on chromatin for ~ 5 - 100 seconds ( 24 ) are efficiently captured by crosslinking in chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques . Comparisons between Hi - C and DNA FISH suggest that loci crosslink in Hi - C if they lie within ~ 100 - 400 nm from each other , with different variants of the Hi - C protocol providing slightly different spatial resolutions ( 15 , 25 ) . Yet , it remains unclear how close two loci need to come together in order to transfer regulatory information , and how long the contacts need to last in order to yield productive activation of a target gene . Based on the complex dynamics of our model locus , we reasoned that non - linearities in chromatin contact kinetics might account for the sigmoidal response of transcription with Hi - C contacts observed experimentally . While Hi - C captures transient and close contacts ( 15s , 200 nm ) , the capture radius and minimum duration of productive interactions between distal chromatin loci remain undetermined . We first tested how the frequency of productive interactions between loci would change as a function of the capture radius ( Fig . 4 E ) or the minimum duration ( Fig . 4 H ) . The frequency of productive interactions with the promoter as a function of genomic distance varied non - linearly with the capture radius or the minimum duration ( Fig . 4 F , I ) . Interestingly , the frequency of productive interactions also displayed a non - linear relationship with the frequency of transient , close contacts mimicking Hi - C capture ( 15s , 200 nm ) for a series of capture radii and minimal durations ( Fig . 4 G , J , Supp . Fig . 3 C ) . We also confirmed that , independent of gatings in radius and duration , loop extrusion drives long , infrequent interactions between distant loci , but not short frequent interactions between nearby loci ( Supp . Fig . 3 D and E ) . When combining changes in minimum duration and capture radius , we found that the frequency of long interactions within a large capture radius ( > 1 min , 400 nm ) exhibited a sigmoidal response to the frequency of close contacts mimicking Hi - C capture ( 15s , 200 nm ; Fig . 4 K and Supp . Fig . 3 F and G ) . Recent observations show that cohesin depletion results in a sharp drop in the frequency of productive bursts of transcription , with little change in their duration or amplitude ( 23 ) . Simulated productive interactions ( 400 nm , 2 min ) echoed these findings , predicting less frequent contacts , but no major changes in their duration in the presence of LEF depletion ( Fig . 4 L ) . Interestingly , the predicted effect of cohesin depletion on the frequency of productive interactions is much more pronounced at large genomic distances , consistent with findings that loop extrusion is crucial for enhancer function only at large distances ( 26 , 27 ) . Discussion In this study , we developed a parameter optimization workflow to predict the respective contributions of loop extrusion and E attr from Hi - C maps . We were able to fit biophysical models of the chromatin fiber to Hi - C data using the Nelder - Mead algorithm , confirming that a combination of the two processes provides a tractable but realistic depiction of the large - scale features of chromatin folding ( 3 , 8 ) . Importantly , best - fit simulations predict not only population - averaged observables such as Hi - C contact frequency but also single - cell variability , measured with DNA FISH . Besides the modeling proposed here , the String Binders Switch ( SBS ) model ( 8 ) of chromatin has recently been used to fit experimental 3D organization data . In this model , different segments of chromatin are assigned a different binder type and can phase - separate into different globular compartments , compartmental TADs , or sub - TAD structures . The SBS approach successfully models chromatin organization in detail , at the cost of a larger , more complex set of parameters . The parameter optimization is computationally costly , requiring several days of computational time for 13 parameters used in our MYC locus model . Increasing the number of parameters would likely increase optimization time and / or require additional constraints , such as prior knowledge of CTCF binding ( 8 ) . The model presented here offers the advantage of simplicity and only needs Hi - C data as input for parameter optimization . Validating the model on the oncogenic rewiring of the MYC locus , we found that the rewiring is consistent with a loss of E attr rather than a loss of loop extrusion permeability ( Fig . 2 and 3 ) . While major changes in loop extrusion permeability are ruled out by the simulations , we cannot rule out small changes in loop extrusion permeability that might fall under the method’s detection threshold . Such small changes are unlikely to explain the observed rewiring ( Fig . 2 E , Supp . Fig . 1 J ) . In addition to blocking loop extrusion by cohesin , CTCF facilitates interactions of different compartments ( 28 ) . It is thus possible that CTCF might play this non - canonical role instead of TAD insolation when bound to the boundary between TAD3 and TAD4 in T cells . One possible explanation for the disruption of E attr at the MYC locus could be the loss of histone methylation marks . Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) establishes initial H3K27me2 / 3 and spreads H3K27me3 on chromatin ( 29 ) . Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 ( PRC1 ) reads these H3K27me3 marks and induces the formation of chromatin compartments by forming oligomers ( 29 ) . PRC2 is frequently mutated or silenced in T - ALL , and is inactive in CUTLL1 ( 30 ) . Consistently , T - ALL and CUTLL1 exhibit low H3K27me3 levels genome - wide ( 30 ) , which could lead to the E attr changes observed at the MYC locus . Analyzing the dynamics of chromatin structures , we observed that pairs of loci with similar Hi - C contact frequencies exhibit distinct looping dynamics : nearby loci pairs are dominated by thermal fluctuations while loci far apart exhibit more infrequent interactions mediated by loop extrusion . These observations raise the question of how the temporal dimension - largely missed in Hi - C - factors into long - range regulation . Transcription activation from a distal enhancer exhibits a sigmoidal relationship to the Hi - C contact frequency with its target promoter ( 17 ) . The simulations presented here suggest that the sigmoidal relationship could emerge from productive interactions being limited to long events ( > 1min ) within a larger capture radius ( ~ 400 nm ) than that of Hi - C . In support of this idea , the time - and distance - gated model proposed here recapitulates several observations : the increased dependence of loop extrusion for transcription activation from long distances ( 27 , 32 ) ; the stronger effect of loop extrusion perturbations on the frequency of activation intervals compared to their duration ( 23 ) ; the fact that Sox2 transcription exhibits little temporal correlation with distance to its SCR enhancer - since the SCR lies within < 400 nm of the promoter the vast majority of the time , the model predicts near uninterrupted enhancer - promoter communication ( 33 , 34 ) ; the strong temporal correlation between enhancer - promoter distance and transcription activity for artificial systems where the enhancer regularly explores distances outside of the ~ 400 nm capture radius from the promoter ( 35 , 36 ) . While other mechanisms have also been proposed to account for the non - linearity observed between chromatin contact matrices and transcription regulation ( 17 , 37 , 38 ) , the simulations presented here demonstrate that the choice of a specific contact observable as a metric is not a neutral decision , but in itself can introduce non - linearities . More importantly , these findings put into question the use of a single metric ( e . g . Hi - C contact ) to describe a complex dynamic ensemble ( the chromatin fiber ) . A unidimensional metric has obvious practical advantages , yet it remains unknown which features of chromatin’s dynamic ensemble are interpreted by the cell to orchestrate long - distance regulation , and whether those features are captured by Hi - C contacts linearly and unambiguously . While the values of the time and distance gates presented here are by necessity approximative due to the simplicity of the model , they represent plausible estimates . The contact radius of ~ 400 nm , sufficient to generate a sigmoid relationship with Hi - C contacts in simulations , is tantalizingly close to the typical size of transcription clusters or hubs : dynamic , non - stoichiometric assemblies of transcription factors and co - activators observed around active genes and enhancers ( 34 ) . Interestingly , the 400 nm capture radius also coincides with the typical distance under which promoters are more likely to burst in sync ( 39 ) . These findings are consistent with the idea that regulatory information transfer might not rely on direct molecular contacts between chromatin segments , but rather on the continued presence of distal elements within a relatively large radius . Transcription regulators might then diffuse at a very short range between chromatin segments , possibly confined within local nano environments characterized by specific composition and biochemical properties ( 40 ) . In such a model , why would only interactions longer than ~ 2 minutes become productive ? One possibility is that time - gating ensures regulatory specificity : increased dwell times of transcription activators at regulatory targets are stronger predictors of transcription output than increased average occupancy ( 41 ) , suggesting the presence of kinetic proofreading steps in the transcription cycle ( 42 - 44 ) . The minimal duration of ~ 2 min predicted by the model allows a few typical transcription factor binding events to take place , which is likely sufficient to enable proofreading of the transcription binding events . Our parameter optimization can be adapted to build biophysical models of any locus of interest . Despite the model simplicity , the best - fit simulations are sufficient to predict the contribution of loop extrusion and domain interactions , as well as single - cell variability from Hi - C data . Modeling dynamics enables testing mechanistic relationships between chromatin dynamics and transcription regulation . As more experimental results emerge to define simulation parameters , updates to the model should further increase its power .
