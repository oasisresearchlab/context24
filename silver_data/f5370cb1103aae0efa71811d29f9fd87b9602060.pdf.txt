Abstract : Glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor modiﬁcation is a posttranslational modiﬁcation of proteins that has been conserved in eukaryotes . The biosynthesis and transfer of GPI to proteins are carried out in the endoplasmic reticulum . Attachment of GPI to proteins is mediated by the GPI - transamidase ( GPI - TA ) complex , which recognizes and cleaves the C - terminal GPI attachment signal of precursor proteins . Then , GPI is transferred to the newly exposed C - terminus of the proteins . GPI - TA consists of ﬁve subunits : PIGK , GPAA1 , PIGT , PIGS , and PIGU , and the absence of any subunit leads to the loss of activity . Here , we analyzed functionally important residues of the ﬁve subunits of GPI - TA by comparing conserved sequences among homologous proteins . In addition , we optimized the puriﬁcation method for analyzing the structure of GPI - TA . Using puriﬁed GPI - TA , preliminary single particle images were obtained . Our results provide guidance for the structural and functional analysis of GPI - TA . Keywords : glyco - diosgenin ; GPI - anchored proteins ; GPI - transamidase ; protein purification ; single particle 1 . Introduction Protein anchoring by glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) is a conserved posttransla - tional modiﬁcation in eukaryotes [ 1 – 4 ] . More than 150 proteins such as adhesion molecules , receptors , ligands , hydrolytic enzymes , and prion proteins are in the form of GPI - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) on the cell surface in mammalian cells . GPI confers unique properties to proteins . For example , GPI - APs are associated with lipid rafts and dynamic membrane domains composed of sphingolipids and cholesterol [ 5 ] . The association with lipid rafts regulates polarized transport , signal transduction , and endocytosis [ 6 – 9 ] . GPI biosynthesis and transfer to proteins are carried out on the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane . The synthesis of GPI is started from phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) by the stepwise addition of sugars , a fatty acid , and ethanolamine - phosphates ( EtNPs ) . GPI precursor proteins , which have an N - terminal signal sequence for ER translocation and a GPI attachment signal peptide at the C - terminus , are separately synthesized ( Figure 1A ) . Once the proteins are translocated into the luminal side of the ER , the N - terminal signal Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / molecules26185462 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / molecules Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 2 of 16 sequence is cleaved by signal peptidases , and the C - terminal GPI attachment signal peptide is recognized by GPI - transamidase ( GPI - TA ) , which transfers a GPI to the proteins [ 10 ] . Mammalian GPI - TA is a multi - subunit complex consisting of ﬁve subunits : PIGK , GPAA1 , PIGT , PIGS , and PIGU ( Figure 1B ) . PIGK is the catalytic subunit of GPI - TA , and is homologous with members of the cysteine protease family with transaminase activity [ 11 ] . PIGK likely cleaves the GPI attachment signal between ω and ω + 1 sites and forms the thioester bond on the catalytic Cys residue to generate an enzyme – substrate intermediate . GPI is then transferred to the newly exposed C - terminus of the protein . This reaction may be mediated by GPAA1 , which is structurally similar to M28 - type aminopeptidase [ 3 , 12 ] . GPAA1 is proposed to catalyze the formation of an amide bond between the ω - site and the bridging EtNP on the GPI complete precursor [ 13 ] . Mammalian PIGK and PIGT form an intermolecular disulﬁde bond that stabilizes GPI - TA formation . The loss of this disulﬁde bond reduces the activity of GPI - TA [ 14 ] . Through sequence homology analysis , PIGT is predicted to form an open - ring β - propeller structure with an additional α - helical N - terminal hook that can embrace another subunit [ 15 , 16 ] . PIGU is homologous with other GPI biosynthetic enzymes ( such as PIGW and PIGM ) , suggesting that it recognizes the lipid portion of GPI [ 17 ] . Lacking PIGU , other subunits ( PIGK , GPAA1 , PIGT and PIGS ) still form a complex , but have no activity . PIGS is an indispensable subunit of GPI - TA activity , although its role is unclear . Mutations in the GPI - TA genes PIGK [ 18 ] , GPAA1 [ 19 ] , PIGT [ 20 ] , PIGS [ 21 ] , and PIGU [ 22 ] have been reported to cause inherited GPI deﬁciencies ( IGDs ) , which are char - acterized by intellectual disability , seizures , hypotonia , and facial deformities [ 23 ] . In addition , somatic PIGT mutations in hematopoietic stem cells cause a type of paroxys - mal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) that has autoinﬂammatory features such as aseptic meningitis [ 24 , 25 ] . On the other hand , dysregulated overexpression of GPI - TA subunits is known to promote various cancers including bladder cancer , lymphoma , and breast cancer [ 26 ] . Therefore , understanding the molecular and structural bases of GPI - TA is of great signiﬁcance for the development of therapies for diseases . Due to the complex structure of GPI - TA , which consists of ﬁve subunits with mul - tiple transmembrane domains , its structure is difﬁcult to investigate . To date , only low - resolution structures of subunits yPIGK ( 24 – 337 ) [ 27 ] , yPIGS ( 38 – 467 ) [ 27 ] , and yGAA1 ( 170 – 247 ) [ 28 ] from S . cerevisiae have been observed ; however , a high - resolution structure of GPI - TA has not been solved . The molecular mechanism of GPI - TA is also the most incomprehensible aspect of GPI biosynthesis . Based on the above reasons , we explored the important amino acid residues of the ﬁve subunits of GPI - TA by comparing conserved se - quences and homologs , and then optimized the puriﬁcation method of the GPI - TA complex for cryo - EM structure analysis . The results provide important information for acquiring a high - resolution structure of GPI - TA and understanding the molecular mechanism . 2 . Results and Discussion 2 . 1 . Exploration of Functionally Important Residues of the GPI - TA Complex GPI - TA consists of ﬁve subunits : PIGK , GPAA1 , PIGT , PIGS , and PIGU ( Figure 1B ) . We previously constructed human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) - based knockout ( KO ) cell library defective in genes required for GPI biosynthesis [ 29 ] . The library contains KO cells defective in each GPI - TA subunit gene ( PIGK - KO , GPAA1 - KO , PIGT - KO , PIGS - KO , and PIGU - KO ) . To clarify the functionally important residues of each subunit , the KO cells were used to analyze the rescue of GPI - APs ( CD55 and CD59 ) expression by transfection of the mutant constructs . PIGK is the catalytic subunit of GPI - TA and shares the sequence with members of the cysteine protease family . Residues His164 and Cys206 are the putative active sites of PIGK [ 30 ] , and they are highly conserved in the cysteine protease family such as legumain ( UniProtKB : Q99538 ) [ 31 ] , peptide asparaginyl ligases ( UniProtKB : A0A509GV09 ) [ 32 ] , and vacuolar - processing enzyme beta - isozyme ( UniProtKB : Q39044 ) [ 33 ] . We expressed the H164A or C206S mutant PIGK construct in PIGK - KO cells . The H164A and C206S mutants Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 3 of 16 did not restore the surface expression of CD55 and CD59 ( Figure 2A – C and Figure S1A ) , indicating that the two residues were critical for GPI - TA activity . It has been reported that residue Cys92 of PIGK forms a disulﬁde bond with residue Cys182 of PIGT [ 14 ] . Consistent with previous results , the cell surface expression of CD55 and CD59 was decreased by 40 % and 22 % , respectively , in PIGK - KO cells expressing the PIGK C92S mutant compared with those expressing the wild - type PIGK ( Figure 2A , B and Figure S1A ) , suggesting that the destruction of this disulﬁde bond reduces the activity of GPI - TA . Alternatively , the intermolecular disulﬁde bond would be important for the stability of PIGK , because the mutant protein levels were decreased ( Figure 2C ) . Figure 1 . GPI attachment to proteins mediated by the GPI - TA complex . ( A ) Schematic representation of a GPI precursor protein that possesses an N - terminal signal peptide for ER translocation ( pink ) and a C - terminal GPI attachment signal ( orange ) . The GPI - attachment signal consists of ( 1 ) ω , ω + 1 , and ω + 2 amino acid residues with short side chains ( red ) ; ( 2 ) ﬁve to ten hydrophilic amino acids ( blue ) ; and ( 3 ) 15 – 20 hydrophobic amino acids at the C - terminus ( orange ) . When a GPI precursor protein ( preproprotein ) is translocated into the ER , the N - terminal signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidases . By reaction of the GPI - TA complex , the C - terminal GPI attachment signal is cleaved from proprotein at the ω - site , which is ligated to the preassembled GPI via an amide bond , generating a nascent GPI - AP . The GPI moiety is remodeled during transport , and mature GPI - AP is generated . ( B ) Schematic representation of the GPI - TA , which is a complex with ﬁve subunits localized on the ER membrane . PIGK is a catalytic subunit and forms an intermolecular disulﬁde bond with PIGT . GPAA1 may catalyze the formation of the amide bond between the ω - site and a bridging ethanolamine - phosphate ( EtNP ) on GPI . PIGU may be related to recognizing the GPI attachment signal or the lipid portion of GPI . The function of PIGS is still not clear . Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 4 of 16 Figure 2 . Functional analysis of mutant PIGK . ( A ) PIGK - KO cells were transiently transfected with both a plasmid expressing mutant PIGK and a plasmid expressing BFP . The BFP - positive cells were gated , and the surface expression of CD55 was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry . ( B ) Mean ﬂuorescence intensity of CD55 in PIGK - KO cells expressing wild - type PIGK - StrepII - GST was set to 1 , and the relative intensities of CD55 in PIGK - KO cells expressing mutant PIGK - StrepII - GST are displayed as the mean ± SD from three independent experiments with p - values ( unpaired Student’s t - test ) . * * * * , p < 0 . 0001 . ( C ) Cell lysates prepared from the cells used in ( A ) were analyzed by western blotting . Expression of wild - type or mutant PIGK - StrepII - GST was detected . BFP was used as a control to check the transfection levels and loading . ( D ) PIGK homology model generated using the Phyre2 website . The functionally important residues ( H164 , C206 , and C92 ) are depicted as green sticks , oxygen is shown in red , nitrogen is shown in blue , and sulfur is shown in yellow . We next compared the PIGK sequences among Homo sapiens ( UniProtKB : Q92643 ) , Mus musculus ( UniProtKB : Q9CXY9 ) , Xenopus tropicalis ( UniProtKB : Q05AQ6 ) , Danio rerio ( UniProtKB : Q6IQM5 ) , Drosophila melanogaster ( UniProtKB : Q8T4E1 ) , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( UniProtKB : P49018 ) to identify the important residues of PIGK ( Figure S1B ) . More - over , we constructed the PIGK homology model using the Phyre2 website [ 34 ] ( Figure 2D ) . Human PIGK structure was most similar to a cysteine protease legumain [ 31 ] . The residues Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 5 of 16 that were charged and conserved among species and residues around the active center of the homology model were selected and replaced with Ala . We prepared 21 mutant PIGK constructs by site - directed mutagenesis , and the rescue efﬁciency of GPI - TA activity in PIGK - KO cells was analyzed by transient transfection of the constructs ( Figure S1C ) . Unexpectedly , although 21 mutant constructs were transfected , all the constructs rescued the expression of CD55 . However , when we expressed the PIGK mutants under a minimum promoter , some mutants such as N58A , R60A , and D204A weakened the rescue efﬁciency compared with wild - type PIGK ( Figure S1D ) . These results suggest that once PIGK is incorporated into the complex , it could remain active , even the activity is weakened with certain mutations , but not catalytic residue mutations . GPAA1 has weak homology to M28 family peptidases , which usually have one or two metal ions in tetrahedral coordination [ 35 , 36 ] . The GPAA1 homology model was constructed by Phyre2 ( Figure 3A ) . GPAA1 was structurally similar to type II glutaminyl cyclases [ 37 ] , which also belong to M28 family peptidases . Mammalian and insect type II glutaminyl cyclases were originally believed to be Zn - dependent enzymes [ 38 – 40 ] . How - ever , several lines of evidence suggest that Zn - binding is dispensable for the activity [ 41 – 45 ] . In particular , structural analysis of glutaminyl cyclase from the black - legged tick Ixodes scapularis indicates that it possesses Zn ions , but that are independent of the activity [ 37 ] . For GPAA1 , it is not clear whether the metal ion bindings are required for the catalytic functions . Based on the structure of the M28 peptidases , it has been reported that Asp153 and Glu226 in human GPAA1 ( UniProtKB : O43292 ) may be residues for Zn1 , and Asp153 ( shared in two zinc ) , Asp188 , and Tyr328 may be residues for Zn2 [ 13 , 16 ] . The Asp153 , Glu226 , Asp188 , and Tyr328 residues are closely accommodated in the cavity of the GPAA1 structure ( Figure 3A ) . Single point mutants ( D153A , E226A , D188A , and Y328A ) and double point mutants ( D188A , E226A ) of these residues for the putative metal binding sites could restore the CD55 expression of GPAA1 - KO cells ( Figure S2A , B ) . It should be noted that the rescue efﬁciencies of those mutant constructs by transient expression were a little weaker than that of wild - type GPAA1 . These results suggest that at least these metal binding sites are not essential for GPI - TA activity , which is consistent with the independence of Zn ions for a GPAA1 structural homolog protein , I . scapularis glutaminyl cyclase [ 37 ] and similar catalytic mechanisms might be considered . Instead , the mutation in the Asp250 residue of GPAA1 ( D250A ) among the conserved sequences could not fully rescue CD55 expression ( Figure S2 ) . To conﬁrm this ﬁnding , GPAA1 - KO cells were cotransfected with wild - type GPAA1 or the D250A mutant GPAA1 together with a BFP - expressing construct . The BFP - positive region was gated , and the expression of CD55 and CD59 was analyzed . The D250A construct reduced GPI - TA activity without changing the protein stability ( Figure 3B , C and Figure S3 ) . In addition , mutations in N - glycosylation sites ( N203Q and N517Q ) of GPAA1 did not reduce the expression of CD55 on the cell surface ( Figure S2 ) . The PIGT Cys182 residue forms an intermolecular disulﬁde bond with C92 on PIGK , as described above [ 14 ] . The C182S mutant reduced the restoration efﬁciency of GPI - TA activity in PIGT - KO cells , which is consistent with the result of the PIGK C92S mutant ( Figure 4A and Figure S3 ) . We also checked the restoration of CD55 surface expression using constructs mutated in conserved amino acids of PIGT ( Figure S4 ) . The mutation in Glu429 of PIGT ( E429A ) lost GPI - TA activity ( Figure 4A and Figure S3 ) . The expression of E429A was reduced compared to that of the wild - type Myc - PIGT ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting that Glu429 is required for PIGT stability or assembly into the GPI - TA complex . In addition , the conserved amino acids in PIGS among species were mutated and the restoration of the activity was analyzed using KO cells ( Figure S5 ) . To analyze the importance of N - glycosylation sites on each subunit protein , N - glycosylation sites were mutated in PIGT ( N164Q , N291Q , and N327Q ) ( Figure S4 ) and PIGS ( N267Q and N370Q ) [ 21 ] ( Figure S5 ) . All the constructs mutated in N - glycosylation sites could restore the expression of CD55 on the cell surface , suggesting that N - glycans on the subunits do not affect GPI - TA activity . Among the PIGU constructs mutated in the conserved amino acids ( Figure S6 ) , the construct with mutations in both Leu375 and Trp376 residues ( L375A , W376A ) reduced the restoration Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 6 of 16 activity ( Figure 4B , D and Figure S3 ) . The protein expression level of the L375A and W376A mutants was the same as that of the wild - type HSV - PIGU . Taken together , we explored the functionally important residues of the GPI - TA complex . In addition to the catalytic active sites on PIGK ( His164 and Cys206 ) and Cys residues that form an intermolecular disulﬁde bond between PIGK ( Cys92 ) and PIGT ( Cys182 ) , we found important residues for GPI - TA activity including GPAA1 ( Asp250 ) , PIGT ( Glu429 ) , and PIGU ( Leu375 , Phe376 ) . Figure 3 . Functionally important residues of GPAA1 . ( A ) GPAA1 homology model constructed using the Phyre2 website . The D250 residue is depicted in green , and the residues for putative metal binding sites are depicted in yellow . ( B , C ) GPAA1 - KO cells were transiently transfected with both a plasmid expressing GPAA1 - 3HA ( wild - type or D250A ) and a plasmid expressing BFP . The BFP - positive cells were gated , and the surface expression of CD55 was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry ( B ) . Protein levels of GPAA1 - 3HA were detected by western blotting ( C ) . BFP was used as a control to check the transfection levels and loading . Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 7 of 16 Figure 4 . Functionally important residues of PIGT and PIGU . ( A , B ) Surface expression of CD55 in PIGT - KO ( A ) and PIGU - KO ( B ) cells transiently expressing wild - type or mutant PIGT - 6Myc and PIGU - 3HSV constructs , respectively , was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry , as described in Figure 2A . ( C , D ) Expression of PIGT - 6Myc ( C ) and PIGU - 3HSV ( D ) mutants was detected by western blotting . BFP was used as a control to check the transfection levels and loading . 2 . 2 . Expression of PIGK Recombinant Protein To understand the GPI - TA structure , we next examined methods for puriﬁcation of the GPI - TA complex in a large scale . StrepII - GST - tagged or StrepII - tagged human PIGK was stably expressed in PIGK - deﬁcient human K562 ( K562K ) cells [ 46 ] . The expression of hPIGK - StrepII - GST and hPIGK - StrepII was detected at 70 kDa by anti - GST ( Figure 5A ) and 45 kDa by anti - StrepII ( Figure 5C ) , respectively . Flow cytometric analysis conﬁrmed that both constructs successfully rescued the expression of CD55 on the cell surface in K562K cells ( Figure 5B , D ) . Under nonreducing conditions ( - DTT ) , both recombinant hPIGK - StrepII - GST and hPIGK - StrepII migrated slowly and were detected at higher molecular weights ( Figure 5E , F ) , suggesting the formation of an intermolecular disulﬁde bond with Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 8 of 16 PIGT . These results support that both recombinant hPIGK - StrepII - GST and hPIGK - StrepII form active GPI - TA complexes with PIGT , PIGU , PIGS , and GPAA1 . Figure 5 . Establishment of cells for GPI - TA puriﬁcation . ( A , B ) K562 PIGK - KO ( K562K ) cells and K562K cells stably expressing PIGK - StrepII - GST were lysed , and PIGK - StrepII - GST was detected by the anti - GST antibody ( A ) . The surface expression of CD55 in these cells was analyzed using ﬂow cytometry ( B ) . ( C , D ) K562 PIGK - KO ( K562K ) cells and K562K cells stably expressing PIGK - StrepII were lysed , and PIGK - StrepII was detected by the anti - StrepII antibody ( C ) . Surface expression of CD55 in those cells was analyzed using ﬂow cytometry ( D ) . ( E , F ) PIGK - StrepII - GST ( E ) and PIGK - StrepII ( F ) samples were prepared under reducing ( sample buffer with dithiothreitol ( + DTT ) ) and nonreducing ( sample buffer without dithiothreitol ( − DTT ) ) conditions . Both PIGK - StrepII - GST and PIGK - StrepII were detected at higher molecular weights under the nonreducing condition , indicating the formation of intermolecular disulﬁde bonds with PIGT . Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 9 of 16 2 . 3 . Optimization of the Puriﬁcation Conditions of the GPI - TA Complex Since a GPI - TA complex has ~ 20 transmembrane domains in total ( Figure 1B ) , it is difﬁcult to purify GPI - TA without destroying the complex structure . First , we tried to use StrepTactin Sepharose and Glutathione Sepharose beads to purify the GPI - TA complex . However , the reduced glutathione contained in the elution buffer of Glutathione Sepharose beads broke the disulﬁde bond between PIGK and PIGT ( Figure S7A ) . At the same time , β - mercaptoethanol ( β - ME ) , a reducing reagent commonly used in puriﬁcation experiments at low concentrations , also destroyed the structure of the GPI - TA complex ( Figure S7B ) . Therefore , we chose to use StrepTactin Sepharose beads for single - step puriﬁcation of the GPI - TA complex without adding any reducing reagent . The choice of detergent is critical for the solubilization , monodispersity , and stability of membrane proteins in the puriﬁcation process . In addition , detergent affects the dispersal of protein samples on the grid for cryogenic electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) analysis . First , we applied three kinds of detergent to purify the GPI - TA complex : n - dodecyl - β - D - maltopyranoside ( DDM ) ; cholesteryl hemisuccinate ( CHS ) , which was added to DDM in a ratio of 1 : 5 ( w : w ) , with the resulting detergent called DDM - CHS ; and digitonin . Among them , the lipid compound CHS was used in the puriﬁcation and crystallization of various GPCRs [ 47 – 49 ] , thus stabilizing membrane proteins [ 50 ] . In the puriﬁed protein fraction , all ﬁve subunits of the GPI - TA complex could be detected by silver staining and were conﬁrmed by mass spectrometry ( Figure S7C and Table S1 ) , and part of the disulﬁde bonds between PIGK and PIGT were retained under conditions using any of the detergents ( Figure S7D ) . However , when DDM was used as a detergent , the puriﬁed protein structure was unstable and the protein mass fraction was decreased when analyzed by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) ( Figure S7E ) . The cryo - EM results showed that the protein particles puriﬁed with DDM - CHS were scattered on the edges because the ice in the center was too thin . The particles in the center were evenly dispersed ( Figure S7F ) . Compared to DDM - CHS , digitonin particles have more difﬁculty entering the holes in the samples . When using DDM , only small particles were observed , which may be individual subunits of the GPI - TA complex . We next applied glyco - diosgenin ( GDN ) as a detergent during purification . Since it has multiple advantages such as > 10 % solubility and nontoxic byproducts , it is widely used to solubilize and purify membrane proteins for the purpose of structural and cryo - EM studies [ 51 – 54 ] . In addition , we chose K562K cells expressing hPIGK - StrepII instead of hPIGK - GST - StrepII to purify the GPI - TA complex since the GST tag is relatively large and easily forms dimer structures [ 55 ] . Membrane fraction was first solubilized in solubilization buffer containing DDM - CHS , then the soluble fraction was purified in buffer containing GDN . The purified GPI - TA complex containing all five subunits could be observed ( Figure 6A ) . Most of the PIGK formed disulfide bonds with PIGT under nonreducing conditions ( Figure 6A , B ) . In addition , the protein particles with GDN were equally dispersed on the grids for cryo - EM ( Figure 6C ) compared to the other detergents . Therefore , we chose K562K - hPIGK - StrepII cells and GDN as detergents for purification of the GPI - TA complex . 2 . 4 . Preliminary Cryo - EM Analysis of GPI - TA Complex To date , low - resolution structures of yPIGK ( 24 – 337 ) , yPIGS ( 38 – 467 ) [ 27 ] , and yGAA1 ( 170 – 247 ) [ 28 ] from S . cerevisiae have been resolved . However , little is known about the structure of the GPI - TA complex . Using the GDN - puriﬁed GPI - TA complex containing hPIGK - StrepII , we performed a preliminary cryo - EM on the GPI - TA complex to evaluate the sample quality . Single particle analysis of the GPI - TA complex using 300 kV cryo - EM equipped with a K2 summit direct electron detector camera showed monodisperse particles ( Figure 6C ) . The particles extracted from more than two thousand images were classiﬁed into several representative 2D classes ( Figure 6D ) . At this resolution , it was difﬁcult to verify the stoichiometry and composition of the GPI - TA complex , whereas putative trans - membrane regions and a soluble globular domain could be observed ( Figure 6E ) . The soluble domain would be the luminal domain of GPI - TA based on the protein topology and Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 10 of 16 the active site . These results indicate the sample quality of GDN - puriﬁed GPI - TA , which would be suitable for structural studies . By using the proposed method and selecting more high - quality single particles , the structure of the fully assembled GPI - TA complex could be acquired in future analysis . Figure 6 . Large - scale puriﬁcation of the GPI - TA complex by GDN . ( A , B ) PIGK - StrepII containing the GPI - TA complex was puriﬁed in buffer containing GDN . The puriﬁed samples were detected by silver staining ( A ) or by western blotting ( B ) . Samples were detected under reducing ( + DTT ) or nonreducing ( − DTT ) conditions as described in Figure 5 .

In addition to catalytic residues ( His164 and Cys206 ) of PIGK and residues for the intermolecular disulﬁde bond between PIGK ( Cys92 ) and PIGT ( Cys182 ) , we found several amino acid residues ( Asp250 on GPAA1 , Glu429 on PIGT , Leu375 and Phe376 on PIGU ) , which are critical for GPI - TA activity or stability . We further optimized the puriﬁcation process of the GPI - TA and applied the puriﬁed complex for a preliminary structural analysis using single - particle imaging . We found that solubilization of GPI - TA in buffer containing DDM - CHS detergent , followed by puriﬁcation in buffer containing GDN detergent was the best for keeping ﬁve subunits and particle distribution on the grids for cryo - EM . Our study provides the basis for functional and structural analysis of the GPI - TA complex . 4 . Materials and Methods 4 . 1 . Cell Lines , Antibodies , and Reagents HEK293 ( ATCC CRL - 1573 ) cells and their derivatives were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle medium ( DMEM ) with high glucose , glutamine ( 01 - 052 - 1ACS , Biological Industries , Beit HaEmek , Israel ) and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( 04 - 001 - 1ACS , Biological Industries , Israel ) at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . PIGK - KO , GPAA1 - KO , PIGT - KO , PIGS - KO , and PIGU - KO cells were previously constructed [ 29 ] . K562K ( K562 PIGK - KO ) [ 46 ] cells were cultured in DMEM with high glucose , glutamine and 10 % fetal bovine serum . K562K - hPIGK - StrepII or K562K - hPIGK - StrepII - GST cells were established by transfection of the plasmid pME - puro - hPIGK - StrepII or pME - puro - hPIGK - StrepII - GST into K562K cells , respectively , and selection using puromycin ( ant - pr - 5 , In vivo Gen , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Mouse monoclonal anti - CD55 ( clone IA10 ) [ 56 ] , anti - CD59 ( clone 5H8 ) [ 57 ] , anti - GST ( HT601 , TransGen Biotech , Beijing , China ) , anti - Myc ( HT101 , TransGen Biotech ) , anti - StrepII ( M211 - 3 , MBL , Nagoya , Japan ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - HA ( 3724 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , anti - RFP ( R10367 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) , and anti - HSV ( BRP0002 , Beijing B & M Biotech , Beijing , China ) were used as primary antibodies . F ( ab’ ) 2 - goat anti - mouse IgG ( H + L ) PE ( 12 - 4010 - 82 ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) ( for ﬂow cytometric analysis ) , goat anti - mouse IgG ( H + L ) HRP ( HS201 , TransGen Biotech ) , and goat anti - rabbit IgG ( H + L ) HRP ( HS101 , TransGen Biotech ) ( for western blotting ) were used as the secondary antibodies . StrepTactin Sepharose ( 28 - 9355 - 99 , GE , Chicago , IL , USA ) was used to purify the GPI - TA . 4 . 2 . Plasmids All primers used in this study are listed in Table S2 . The DNA fragments correspond - ing to human PIGK were ampliﬁed from pPB - FRT - hPIGK . The HRV3C protease cleavage site and StrepII were ampliﬁed from the forward primer Strep - tag - F and the reverse primer Strep - tag - R . The DNA fragments consisting of hPIGK and StrepII ( containing the HRV3C protease cleavage site ) were ligated into the EcoRI / NotI site of the vector pME - puro to generate pME - puro - hPIGK - StrepII by using the M - Quick Cloning Mix ( T1406 , Talen - bio , Shanghai , China ) . The DNA fragments corresponding to GST were ampliﬁed from pME - GST and ligated into the SalI / NotI site of the vector pME - puro - hPIGK - StrepII to generate pME - puro - hPIGK - StrepII - GST . The DNA fragments corresponding to hGPAA1 - 3HA , hPIGT - 6Myc , FLAG - hPIGS , and hPIGU - 3HSV , which were ampliﬁed from pME - hGPAA1 - 3HA , pME - hPIGT - 6Myc , pME - FLAG - hPIGS , and pME - hPIGU - 3HSV , respectively , were ligated into the EcoRI / NotI site of the vector pME - Hyg to generate pME - Hyg - hGPAA1 - 3HA , pME - Hyg - hPIGT - 6Myc , pME - Hyg - FLAG - hPIGS , and pME - Hyg - hPIGU - 3HSV . Plasmids harboring mutant PIGK , GPAA1 , PIGT , PIGS , or PIGU were constructed by site - direct mutagenesis based on pME - puro - hPIGK - StrepII - GST , pME - Hyg - hGPAA1 - 3HA , pME - Hyg - hPIGT - 6Myc , pME - Hyg - FLAG - hPIGS , or pME - Hyg - hPIGU - 3HSV , respectively . Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 12 of 16 Generally , conserved amino acids were replaced with Ala or Ser , and the Asn residues on N - glycosylation sites were mutated to Gln . The primers used for the construction of mutant plasmids are listed in Table S2 . 4 . 3 . Transient Transfection and Flow Cytometric Analysis For transient transfection to screen various mutant constructs , cells ( ~ 10 6 cells / well ) were plated in 6 - well plates one day before transfection . Four micrograms of plasmids were transfected into KO cells using polyethyleneimine MAX ( PEI - MAX ) ( 24765 , Polysciences , Warrington , PA , USA ) in OPTI - MEM ( 31985062 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Three days after transfection , the transfected cells were harvested and washed with PBS ( E607009 , Sangon Biotech , Shanghai , China ) . Then , the samples were stained with primary antibodies ( 10 µ g / mL ) in FACS buffer ( PBS containing 1 % BSA and 0 . 1 % NaN3 ) for 25 min on ice . After washing twice with FACS buffer , the samples were stained with the secondary antibody F ( ab’ ) 2 - goat anti - mouse IgG ( H + L ) PE ( 10 µ g / mL ) in FACS buffer for 25 min on ice . The samples were then washed twice with FACS buffer and analyzed using an Accuri C6 system ( BD ) . Accuri C6 and FlowJo software ( BD ) were used to analysis the data . For co - transfection with a BFP construct , cells ( ~ 5 × 10 6 cells / well ) were plated in 12 - well plates one day before transfection . Plasmids ( 0 . 8 µ g of plasmids expressing GPI - TA genes and 0 . 8 µ g of plasmids expressing BFP ( pME - tagBFP ) ) were mixed and transfected into KO cells using PEI - MAX . Three days after transfection , the transfected cells were harvested and stained with antibodies as described above . In mammalian cells , co - transfection efﬁciency is generally high . Therefore , BFP - positive cells were gated and only plasmid - transfected cells were analyzed using an Accuri C6 system . 4 . 4 . Western Blotting Western blotting was performed to conﬁrm the expression level of recombinant pro - teins . Cells ( ~ 10 6 cells / well ) were lysed with 100 µ L of lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) ( HY - B0496 , MedChemExpress , Monmouth Junction , NJ , USA ) , protein inhibitor cocktail ( HY - K0010 , MedChemExpress ) on ice for 30 min . When detecting the recombinant protein PIGU - 3HSV , an additional 8 M urea was added to the lysis buffer . After incubation , the sample was centrifuged at 21 , 600 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C to remove insoluble fractions . The supernatant was mixed with SDS - PAGE loading buffer and kept at 4 ◦ C overnight . To check the protein levels of GPI - TA mutant proteins , BFP was used as a control to check the transfection levels and loading . A plasmid expressing BFP ( pME - tagBFP ) and mutant GPI - TA gene constructs at a ratio of 1 : 1 were mixed and co - transfected into cells . When cell lysate samples were prepared , at least BFP expression levels of cells in Figures 2C , 3C and 4C , D were similar among samples . 4 . 5 . Stable Transfection of hPIGK - StrepII or hPIGK - StrepII - GST Twenty micrograms of pME - puro - hPIGK - StrepII or pME - puro - hPIGK - StrepII - GST was digested by FspI ( R0135s , New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA , USA ) for 4 h at 37 ◦ C . The linearized plasmid was transfected into K562K cells ( ~ 10 7 cells ) suspended in 800 µ L of OPTI - DMEM by electroporation . Cells expressing hPIGK - StrepII or hPIGK - StrepII - GST were screened using the antibiotic puromycin . 4 . 6 . Puriﬁcation of the GPI - TA Complex All the puriﬁcation steps were performed at 4 ◦ C . K562K - hPIGK - StrepII cells ( ~ 50 L ) were harvested by centrifugation and washed with PBS . The cells were disrupted with a mi - croﬂuidizer in TBS ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl ) ( with 1 mM PMSF , protein inhibitor cocktail ) , and the debris was removed by centrifugation ( 8400 × g ) for 20 min . The collected supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100 , 000 × g for 1 h to collect the membrane . Then , the membranes were solubilized by adding 150 mL of solubilization buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 % n - dodecyl - β - D - maltopyranoside ( DDM ) ( 69227 - 93 - 6 , Anatrace , Maumee , Molecules 2021 , 26 , 5462 13 of 16 OH ) —0 . 4 % cholesteryl hemisuccinate ( CHS ) ( C6512 , Merck , Burlington , MA , USA ) , 1 mM PMSF , protein inhibitor cocktail ) . After incubation with rotation for 2 h , the mixture was ultracentrifuged at 100 , 000 × g for 1 h to remove unsolubilized debris . The supernatant was mixed with 5 mL of StrepTactin Sepharose resin pre - equilibrated with buffer A ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 06 % glyco - diosgenin ( GDN ) ( GDN101 , Anatrace ) and rotated for 1 h [ FT ] . StrepTactin Sepharose was collected through the column and washed 10 times with 5 mL of buffer A [ W ] . The GPI - TA complex was eluted by 5 mL of buffer B ( buffer A containing 2 . 5 mM desthiobiotin ( D1411 , Merck ) ) ﬁve times [ E1 , E2 , E3 , E4 , E5 ] . 4 . 7 . Sliver Staining To detect the purity of the puriﬁed GPI - TA complex , a Fast Silver Stain Kit ( P0017S , Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) was used according to the instructions . The protein bands were cut , and the peptides were analyzed using mass spectrometry to verify whether GPI - TA was successfully puriﬁed . 4 . 8 . EM Data Acquisition A total of 2 . 5 µ L of the GPI - TA complex sample was applied to a glow - discharged holey carbon - ﬁlm grid ( Quantifoil , Au 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 , 300 mesh ) blotted with a Vitrobot system ( FEI , Hillsboro , OR ) using a 3 . 0 s blotting time with 100 % humidity at 9 ◦ C , then the sample was plunge - frozen in liquid ethane . Cryo - EM data collection was performed using a 300 kV Titan Krios microscope ( FEI ) equipped with a K2 summit direct electron detector camera ( Gatan Inc . , Pleasanton , CA , USA ) set to super resolution mode , with a pixel size of 0 . 65 Å ( a physical pixel size of 1 . 3 Å ) and a defocus ranging from − 1 . 5 µ m to − 2 . 3 µ m . The specimen stage temperature was maintained at 80 K . The dose rate was 10 e − s − 1 , and each movie was 7 . 6 s long , dose - fractioned into 38 frames with an exposure of 1 . 18 e − Å − 2 for each frame . 4 . 9 . Image Processing A total of 2445 movies were motion - corrected and binned with MotionCor2 [ 58 ] with 5 × 5 patches , which produced summed and dose - weighted micrographs with a pixel size of 1 . 3 Å . Contrast transfer function ( CTF ) parameters were estimated by CTFFIND 4 . 1 [ 59 ] . Particle picking and further image processing were performed using RELION 3 . 0 [ 60 ] . A total of 132 , 558 particles were autopicked and extracted with a box size of 300 × 300 pixels . 2D classiﬁcations were then performed .
