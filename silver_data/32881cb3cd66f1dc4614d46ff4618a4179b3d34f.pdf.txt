Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors . Low - grade gliomas ( LGGs ) include diffuse LGGs ( WHO grade II ) and intermediate - grade gliomas ( WHO grade III ) . Few studies have focused on membrane tension in LGGs . Herein , we assessed the prognostic value of plasma membrane tension - related genes ( MTRGs ) in LGGs . Methods : We selected plasma MTRGs identiﬁed in previous studies for analysis . Based on LGG RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) data in The Cancer Genome Atlas , a prognostic signature containing four genes was constructed via log - rank testing , LASSO regression and stepwise multivariate Cox regression and was validated with other datasets . Additionally , functional annotation , pathway enrichment and immune and molecular characteristics of the prognostic model deﬁned subgroups were analyzed . Thereafter , a predictive nomogram that integrated baseline characteristics was constructed to determine the 3 , 5 , and 10 - year overall survival ( OS ) of patients with LGG . Differentially expressed genes were conﬁrmed via quantitative reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) and immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Results : Our MTRG prognostic signature was based on ARFIP2 , PICK1 , SH3GL2 , and SRGAP3 expression levels . The high - risk group was more positively associated with apoptosis and cell adhesion pathways and exhibited a low IDH1 mutation rate , high TP53 mutation rate and a low 1p19q co - deletion rate . The high - risk group also exhibited incremental inﬁltration of immune cells , more forceful immune activities and high expression of immune checkpoints as well as beneﬁted less from immune therapy compared with the low - risk group . Our prognostic model had better forecasting ability than other scoring systems . We found that the nomogram was a better tool for predicting outcomes for patients with LGG . Finally , qRT - PCR conﬁrmed that SH3GL2 and SRGAP3 expression levels in glioma tissues were signiﬁcantly lower than those in normal brain tissues . The results of IHC analysis conﬁrmed that SH3GL2 protein expression was higher in patients with longer survival . FrontiersinNeurology 01 frontiersin . org Li et al . 10 . 3389 / fneur . 2022 . 1024869 Conclusion : Our plasma membrane tension - related gene prognostic signature is a prospective tool that can differentiate between prognosis , gene mutation landscape , immune microenvironment , immune inﬁltration and immunotherapeutic efficacy in LGG . KEYWORDS LGG , plasma membrane tension , SH3GL2 , survival , prognostic model Introduction Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor that accounts for approximately 80 % of all malignant brain tumors ( 1 ) . Gliomas are deﬁned as brain tumors of glial origin ; depending on their malignant behavior , gliomas can be categorized into WHO grades I – IV . The most common histological types of gliomas include astrocytomas ( grades I – III ) , oligodendrogliomas ( grades II – III ) , oligoastrocytomas ( grades II – III ) and glioblastomas ( grade IV ) ( 2 ) . The prognosis of patients with gliomas varies with the molecular subtype . compared with isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH ) wild - type glioma , mutations in IDH1 / 2 constitute a glioma subtype with better prognosis and distinct ontogeny . O6 methylguanine - DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) expression is repressed by MGMT promoter methylation , which results in TMZ resistance . The 1p19q co - deletion is strongly associated with an oligodendroglial phenotype and favorable prognosis ( 2 – 4 ) . In addition , the cIMPACT - NOW update 3 recommends that IDH wild - type LGG harboring EGFR gene ampliﬁcations , chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss , or TERT promoter mutations will follow an invasive clinical course similar to IDH wild - type glioblastoma and patients with this condition have signiﬁcantly shorter survival ( 5 ) . LGG molecular subtyping may provide additional prognosis information regarding patient outcome ; however , new risk - stratiﬁcation biomarkers need to be identiﬁed . Cell membrane tension aﬀects various vital biological processes , including cytokinesis , cell motility , endocytosis , exocytosis and organelle function sustainability , which is closely correlated with rapid disease progression ( 6 ) . Recent studies have shown that high plasma membrane tension eﬀectively inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion by counteracting the membrane curvature sensing / production of BAR family proteins ( 7 – 9 ) . Membrane tension regulates the cellular pluripotent state via endocytosis - mediated ERK signaling and regulates cellular metabolism through proteasome degradation of the rate - limiting metabolic enzyme phosphofructokinase to maintain high glycolytic rates in cancer cells ( 10 , 11 ) . Recent studies have reported the association between plasma membrane tension and tumor invasion , pluripotency and metabolism ( 12 – 14 ) . However , there are only few studies on its association with LGG prognostic value . To better predict survival of patients with LGG , our prognostic nomogram took into account patient age , grade , IDH mutation and 1p19q co - deletion state while calculating baseline characteristics and risk scores . Our results indicate that our plasma membrane tension - related prognostic model may be a potential prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for LGG . Materials and methods Study ﬂow diagram The study ﬂow diagram is presented in Figure 1 . Collectively , we constructed and externally validated MTRG - based prognostic models which showed signiﬁcant diﬀerential expression between LGG and normal brain tissues . We then performed gene enrichment , clinical characteristics , gene mutation , immune microenvironment and immunotherapy responsiveness analyses of patient groups according to the model . Finally , we validated our results through quantitative reverse - transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) and immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Patient samples RNA - seq data , survival information and baseline characteristics of 529 samples from patients with LGG were obtained from TCGA ( https : / / tcga - data . nci . nih . gov / tcga / ) . RNA - seq data of 207 normal brain tissue samples were obtained from Genotype - Tissue Expression ( GTEx , http : / / commonfund . nih . gov / GTEx / ) . Subsequently , mRNA expression data and survival information of GSE16011 , mRNAseq _ 325 , mRNAseq _ 693 , mRNA - array _ 301 and Rembrandt microarray - independent datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO , http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo ) and China Glioma Genome Atlas ( CGGA , https : / / www . cgga . org . cn / ) for FrontiersinNeurology 02 frontiersin . org Li et al . 10 . 3389 / fneur . 2022 . 1024869 FIGURE1 Flow diagram of the study . external validation . Gene mutation data were obtained from TCGA ( 15 – 18 ) . Differential expression analysis A total of 40 MTRGs were selected for expression analysis based on a literature search ( 19 ) . The list of 40 MTRGs are included in Supplementary material 1 . We performed diﬀerential expression analysis of MTRGs extracted from TCGA and compared them with the GTEx datasets . Diﬀerentially expressed genes were deﬁned as those with a false discovery rate ( FDR ) p value of < 0 . 05 and absolute log2 fold change ( logFC ) of > 1 . We used the “limma” package in R for diﬀerential analysis , and normalized gene expression proﬁles using the normalizeBetweenArrays function ( 19 ) . MTRGs with diﬀerential expression were uploaded to Metascape ( http : / / metascape . org / ) for functional analysis ( 20 ) and subsequently uploaded to String ( https : / / string - db . org / ) to construct a protein interaction network ( 21 ) . Developing and validating our prognostic signature To develop our prognostic signature , log - rank tests , LASSO regression and multivariate Cox regression were used to screen for diﬀerently expressed MTRGs that were signiﬁcantly correlated with LGG prognosis . Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed through a step function , and the lowest AIC value was selected as the ﬁnal model . The risk score for each sample was calculated by multiplying the expression values of speciﬁc genes by their weights in the Cox model and adding them . We categorized the patients into low - and high - risk groups as per a median risk score . Kaplan – Meier ( KM ) curves were used to compare the OS between the two groups , and 3 , 5 , and 10 - year receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curves were plotted . Area under curve ( AUC ) was used to evaluate the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of survival prediction . Finally , validation datasets were used to validate our prognostic signature . Comprehensive analysis of risk score Patients were grouped according to diﬀerent clinical characteristics ( age : divided into younger and older age groups based on the median age ; sex : female and male ; grade : grades II and III ; IDH1 mutation status : IDH1 mutant and IDH1 wild - type and 1p19q co - deletion status : 1p19q codel and 1p19q non - codel ) . The risk scores were analyzed separately for diﬀerences in the clinical features . Thereafter , in the gene mutation analysis , the “maftools” package in R was used to visualize the somatic mutations of the TCGA – LGG samples ( 22 ) . We also calculated tumor mutational burden ( TMB ) for each LGG sample and compared the diﬀerence in TMB of the high - and low - risk groups . Finally , Spearman correlation was used to assess the association between TMB score and our risk score . Gene set enrichment analysis and related LncRNA exploration Gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) ( 23 ) was performed using GSEA v4 . 1 . 0 software ( http : / / www . broadinstitute . org / gsea ) . The Hallmark v7 . 2 , c2 KEGG , and c5 Go BP gene sets were used for further analyses ( 24 ) . GSEA enrichment plots were constructed using the “ggplot2” package in R . In addition , long non - coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) with a correlation coeﬃcient of > 0 . 5 and a p value of < 0 . 05 for ARFIP2 , PICK1 , SH3GL2 , and SRGAP3 were considered to be signiﬁcantly associated with our prognostic model . Subsequently , the lncRNA – mRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape 3 . 8 . 2 , and univariate FrontiersinNeurology 03 frontiersin . org Li et al . 10 . 3389 / fneur . 2022 . 1024869 Cox regression was used to test the signiﬁcance of the association between survival and lncRNAs ( 25 ) . Immune characteristics and immune therapy analysis Samples from the TCGA – LGG cohort were used for immune - related analysis . The enrichment scores of 16 immune cells and 13 immune - related functions per sample were estimated using single - sample GSEA ( ssGSEA ) . The R package “CIBERSORT” was used to quantify 22 immune cell types . Only the samples with a CIBERSORT output p value of < 0 . 05 were selected for further analysis ( 26 ) . We selected eight well - known glioma related immune checkpoints , obtained their mRNA expression and downloaded tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion ( TIDE ) scores , microsatellite instability ( MSI ) , T cell dysfunction scores and T cell exclusion scores from the TIDE website ( http : / / tide . dfci . harvard . edu ) to explore the predictive ability of our prognostic model for immunotherapy response . All these immune - related characteristics of the high - and low - risk groups were compared . Finally , we compared the prognostic value among our prognostic signature , TIDE and T cell inﬁltration score ( TIS ) with the “timeROC” R package ( 27 ) . Prognostic nomogram establishment Using stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis to screen prognostic factors , a model with a minimum AIC value used to assess the 3 , 5 , and 10 - year OS of LGG , including age , grade , IDH mutation , 1p19q co - deletion and our risk score . Calibration curves were plotted to assess the predictive power of the nomogram prognostic model and the multivariate timeROC was plotted to compare the predictive power levels of various features . qRT - PCR and IHC Total RNA was extracted using the TIANGEN RNA Extraction Kit ( TIANGEN , Beijing , China ) and reverse - transcribed using TOROIVD R (cid:13) III Reverse Transcription Kit ( Toroivd , Shanghai , China ) . Quantitative PCR was performed using TOROGreen qPCR Master Mix ( Toroivd , Shanghai , China ) . The results are standardized using GAPDH . qPCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Real Time PCR system and analyzed using Applied Biosystems QuantStudio Design & Analysis Software . Fold change was determined using the 2 − 11 Ct method for gene expression . Gene - speciﬁc PCR primers are listed in Supplementary material 2 . IHC was performed according to the previously described protocol ( 28 ) . LGG tissues were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 ◦ C . Subsequently , tissue samples were embedded in paraﬃn and sectioned at 4 µ m . The sections were dewaxed with xylene , rehydrated using a graded series of alcohol and then placed in a retrieval box containing citrate antigen retrieval buﬀer ( pH 6 . 0 ) for antigen retrieval in a microwave oven . Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating with 3 % H 2 O 2 solution for 10min . The sections were then blocked with 5 % BSA for 30 min and incubated with SH3GL2 antibody ( 1 : 400 , 12345 - 1 - AP ; ProteinTech ) SRGAP3 antibody ( 1 : 200 , ab204408 ; Abcam ) overnight at 4 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed chamber . The sections were then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 1 h and treated with SABC for 1h . After each incubation step , sections were washed three times with phosphate - buﬀered saline for 5min each . Finally , the specimens were stained with DAB chromogen ( Zhongshan Jinqiao ) and counterstained with hematoxylin . Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an immunohistochemical kit ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) . Clinical information on samples in qRT - PCR and IHC experiments is provided in Supplementary material 3 . Immunohistochemical image analysis was conducted as follows : H - SCORE = P ( pi × i ) = ( percentage of weak intensity × 1 ) + ( percentage of moderate intensity × 2 ) + ( percentage of strong intensity × 3 ) ( 29 , 30 ) . Statistical analyses Diﬀerences in the indicators of the high - and low - risk groups were compared by Wilcoxon test . Univariate survival analysis was performed by KM survival analysis and log - rank test . Multivariate survival analysis was performed using Cox regression models . Two - sided p < 0 . 05 was considered signiﬁcant . Statistical data analysis was performed using the R software ( Version 4 . 0 . 5 ) . Results Differentially expressed MTRGs The results of diﬀerential gene expression analysis of 40 MTRGs between 529 TCGA – LGG samples and 207 GTEx normal brain tissue samples are shown in Supplementary Figure 1A . Overall , 17 MTRGs were identiﬁed as diﬀerentially expressed genes ( Figure 2A ) and were ranked according to the signiﬁcance of diﬀerences ( Figure 2B ) . The results of functional analysis showed that the diﬀerentially expressed MTRGs in LGG and normal brain tissues were mainly enriched through synaptic vesicle endocytosis , CDC42 GTPase cycle , endocytosis regulation and actin ﬁlament organization regulation ( Figure 2C ) . Finally , the protein – protein interaction network is shown in Figure 2D .

FrontiersinNeurology 05 frontiersin . org Li et al . 10 . 3389 / fneur . 2022 . 1024869 Construction and validation of MTRG - related prognostic signature The prognostic signature was constructed based on RNA - seq data from TCGA . Among 17 diﬀerentially expressed MTRGs , six of them had statistical signiﬁcance in the prognosis of LGG using log - rank test . High expression of PICK1 , SRGAP2 and PABPC4 were considered predictors of poor prognosis , whereas high SH3GL2 , SRGAP3 , and ARFIP2 expression were considered predictors of positive prognosis in LGG ( Figure 3A ) . Using LASSO and stepwise multivariate Cox regression , we found that only four MTRGs—ARFIP2 , PICK1 , SH3GL2 , and SRGAP3—signiﬁcantly aﬀected the OS of patients with LGG ( Figures 3B , C ) . Next , we constructed a prognostic signature for all LGG samples and calculated their risk score formula as follows : − 0 . 7459 × expression of ARFIP2 + 0 . 3572 × expression of PICK1 − 0 . 2948 × expression of SH3GL2 − 0 . 4229 × expression of SRGAP3 ( Figure 3D ) . There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in terms of patient survival time , survival status and expression of the four MTRGs between the high - and low - risk groups ( Figure 3E , Supplementary Figure 1B ) . The KM curve showed that the OS of the two groups was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and the survival time of the high - risk group was signiﬁcantly shorter than that of the low - risk group ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Finally , time - dependent ROC analysis revealed that the diagnostic accuracy is as follows : 3 - year AUC = 0 . 760 , 5 - year AUC = 0 . 717 and 10 - year AUC = 0 . 739 ( Figure 3F ) . Six validation datasets were used , including the CGGA mRNAseq _ 693 , CGGA mRNAseq _ 325 , the whole CGGA mRNAseq , CGGA mRNA array _ 301 , Rembrandt microarray and the GSE16011 dataset to validate the prognostic model . Patients in each validation dataset were also divided into two groups according to their median risk score . There were also signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the expression of the four genes between the high - and low - risk groups . KM curves and time - correlated ROC analyses were performed for six validation datasets . The results showed that our prognostic signatures could diﬀerentiate well between high - and low - risk populations . It could also eﬀectively estimate OS probabilities for 3 , 5 , and 10 years ( Figures 4 , 5 ) . The expression patterns of the four MTRGs between the high - and low - risk groups in the model are presented in Supplementary Figure 2 . Clinical features and gene mutation landscape Patients in TCGA were stratiﬁed as per their median age , sex , grade , IDH mutation and 1p19q co - deletion status , respectively . There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in risk scores among patients with diﬀerent IDH mutation status , diﬀerent tumor grades and diﬀerent 1p19q deletion status . WHO grade III patients ( p < 0 . 001 ) , IDH - wild - type patients ( p < 0 . 001 ) and chromosome 1p19q non - co - deletion patients ( p < 0 . 001 ) had higher risk scores ( Figure 6A ) . Diﬀerences in these molecular signatures suggested a strong relationship between risk scores and molecular and pathological tumor subtypes . Epigenetic alteration plays a vital role in early malignancies and can inﬂuence prognosis . Here we obtained the mutation spectra of all LGG samples in TCGA . Missense mutations were the most common , followed by nonsense mutations . The most commonly mutated genes were IDH1 , IDH2 , TP53 , ATRX , EGFR , PTEN , CIC and TTN . The results showed that mutations in IDH1 ( 91 % : 63 % , p < 0 . 001 ) and IDH2 ( 6 % : 1 % , p = 0 . 004 ) was more common in the low - risk group and mutations in TP53 ( 44 % : 38 % , p = 0 . 177 ) , EGFR ( 10 % : 1 % , p < 0 . 001 ) and PTEN ( 6 % : 0 % , p < 0 . 001 ) was more common in the high - risk group ( Figures 6B , C ) . Furthermore , we calculated the TMB of each sample . Then , the TMB of the high - and low - risk groups was compared and the correlation between the risk score and the TMB score was analyzed . The results indicated the high - risk group had a higher TMB score ( p < 0 . 001 ) and it was positively correlated with TMB ( R = 0 . 22 , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 6D , Supplementary Figure 3A ) . GSEA and MTRG - related lncRNA network The results of GSEA showed that the apoptosis pathways , immune response related pathways and processes , cell endocytosis , exocytosis and cell adhesion biology processes was enriched in the high - risk group . Detailed results of GSEA are shown in Figures 7A , B . Previous studies have shown that lncRNAs can regulate the expression of target genes in their cis or trans forms , which is the main regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs ( 31 – 34 ) . To explore the possible regulatory mechanisms of MTRGs in our prognostic model for LGG , we screened 28 highly correlated lncRNAs and constructed a lncRNA – mRNA regulatory network ( Figure 7C ) . In our prognostic signature , high expression of SH3GL2 and SRGAP3 suggested a beneﬁcial eﬀect on survival , but high expression of PICK1 led to a poor survival rate . Those lncRNA which positively regulated SH3GL2 or SRGAP3 or negatively regulated PICK1 might beneﬁt in terms of survival . Conversely , the other lncRNAs might have a deleterious eﬀect on patient survival . Survival analysis of the 28 lncRNAs was performed using the KM curve , and the results showed that only two of them had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on survival ; 26 of 28 lncRNAs were consistent with the expected results ( Figure 7D ) . NEAT1 , AC004067 . 1 , AC009227 . 1 , and AC074286 . 1 were associated with all three MTRGs . Among them , NEAT1 and AC004067 . 1 were not only positively correlated with SH3GL2 and SRGAP3 but negatively correlated with PICK1 , whereas AC009227 . 1 and AC074286 . 1 were negatively correlated with SH3GL2 and SRGAP3 and positively correlated with PICK1 .

( F ) KM curve analysis of two groups and ROC curves for 3 , 5 , and 10 - year OS . studies should explore whether these four lncRNAs have a binding relationship with MTRGs . Immune - correlation and immunotherapy beneﬁt analysis To further explore the correlation between the 11 - gene signature risk score and immune status , we used ssGSEA to quantify the enrichment scores of 16 immune cell subgroups and 13 related functions , or pathways . Overall , 12 types of immune cells were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between high - and low - risk groups ( Figure 8A ) . Likewise , all 13 immune - related functions were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the two groups , which revealed a signiﬁcant relationship with risk scores ( Figure 8B ) . Then , CIBERSORT was used to calculate the abundance of 22 immune cells . We used the Wilcoxon test to compare the distribution of immune cells in diﬀerent risk subgroups . We found that resting CD4 memory T cells , regulatory T cells , M0 macrophages and resting mast cells were more abundant in the high - risk subgroup , whereas plasma cells , activated NK cells and activated mast cells were more abundant in the low - risk subgroup ( Figure 8C ) . We found that immune checkpoints ( PD - 1 , PD - L1 , LAG3 , B7 - H3 , B7 - H4 , CD28 , CD40 , and TIM3 ) were signiﬁcantly highly expressed in the high - risk group ( Figure 8D ) . We also found higher TIDE scores ( p = 0 . 046 ) and dysfunction scores ( p < 0 . 001 ) in the high - risk group than in the low - risk group , suggesting that the low - risk group would beneﬁt more from immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ICI ) therapy ( Figure 8E ) . Finally , we calculated the AUC for TIDE = 0 . 514 and for T cell - inﬂamed signature ( TIS ) = 0 . 707 , so we suggest that the predictive value of our prognostic signature was better than TIS and TIDE in LGG ( Figure 8F ) . Construction of nomogram The nomogram included the risk score and baseline characteristics ( age , grade , IDH mutation status and 1p19q co - deletion status ) and was built to estimate 3 , 5 , and 10 - year survival probabilities ( Figures 9A , B ) . We found that the AUC for OS from the nomogram model was greater than any other factor , implying that the nomogram incorporated risk score and clinical features could assess patient survival more accurately than a single prognostic signature ( Figure 9C ) . For calibration curves forecasting 3 , 5 , and 10 - year survival , red lines represent the estimated survival and gray lines represent the ideal survival time . All three lines were tightly aligned , showing good calibration in the TCGA dataset ( Figure 9D ) . Data from the validation sets ( CGGA mRNAseq 693 and CGGA mRNA - seq 325 ) were also acceptable in terms of predictive power ( Supplementary Figure 3B ) . Validation of MTRGs expression levels in the prognostic model Combined with the results of qRT - PCR , we noticed that the RNA expression levels of ARFIP2 , PICK1 , SH3GL2 , and SRGAP3 in normal brain tissue were higher than those in LGG tissue , and the diﬀerence between SH3GL2 and SRGAP3 was statistically signiﬁcant ( Figure 10A ) . In addition , the IHC results showed that samples from two patients with a survival period of more than 50 months had high expression of SH3GL2 ( Samples 1 and 3 ) . The samples from three deceased patients revealed low SH3GL2 expression ( Samples 2 , 4 and 7 ) . SH3GL2 protein expression was low in two IDH1 wild - type samples ( Samples 6 and 8 ) , one of which hardly expressed SH3GL2 protein ( Figure 10B ) . In summary , SH3GL2 is at the RNA and protein levels . In summary , SH3GL2 showed signiﬁcant inter - group diﬀerences in expression at both RNA and protein levels . The immunohistochemical results of SRGAP3 are shown in Supplementary Figure 4 , and they revealed that SRGAP3 was not expressed in three of the four samples . Discussion Gliomas are common aggressive primary malignant brain tumors that occur in adults . Current treatment strategies for glioma are not adequately eﬀective because of their high inﬁltration rate and heterogeneity . Even after comprehensive treatment , gliomas are prone to recurrence and can easily invade surrounding normal tissues ( 1 – 4 , 35 ) . Recently , increasing evidence indicates that cellular mechanics are intrinsically linked to cancer invasion and FrontiersinNeurology 08 frontiersin . org Li et al . 10 . 3389 / fneur . 2022 . 1024869 FIGURE4 Validation results ( A ) CGGA mRNA - seq _ 693 cohort .

High membrane tension helps maintain cell integrity and increases cell stiﬀness , thereby inhibiting cell migration ( 7 – 9 , 36 , 37 ) . Malignant cells are mechanically characterized by reduced cell stiﬀness , which is strongly correlated with increased invasiveness and metastasis ( 10 – 12 , 38 , 39 ) . To the best of our knowledge , the prognostic value of plasma MTRGs in LGG is yet to be elucidated . In this study , we systematically analyzed the diﬀerences in the expression of 40 MTRGs in tumor tissues and normal brain tissues and examined their relationship with patient prognosis . We then constructed an MTRG - based prognostic risk score model FrontiersinNeurology 09 frontiersin . org Li et al . 10 . 3389 / fneur . 2022 . 1024869 FIGURE5 Validation results ( A ) CGGA array _ 301 cohort . ( B ) Rembrandt microarray cohort . ( C ) GSE16011 cohort . using the TCGA – LGG cohort and validated its stability and eﬀectiveness in the CGGA , GEO , and REMBRANT cohorts . Based on this proposed model , the TCGA – LGG cohort was divided into high - and low - risk groups for further analysis . The results demonstrated that patients with poorer pathological grades had higher risk scores . Other factors , including IDH1 / 2 , TP53 and EGFR mutation status and 1p19q co - deletion status , which are considered to be associated with glioma progression and patient prognosis , are also signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for high - and low - risk groups . These results are consistent with those of previous prognostic models that revealed that high - risk scores are inversely associated with patient outcomes . To further explore the signaling pathways associated with prognostic models , we performed GSEA and noted that our model was associated with multiple cancer - related pathways , including apoptosis , epithelial – mesenchymal transition , reactive oxygen species and immune - related pathways . Furthermore , we constructed an lncRNA – mRNA network to provide potentially useful information on lncRNA – mRNA interaction mechanisms in LGG progression .

FrontiersinNeurology 15 frontiersin . org Li et al . 10 . 3389 / fneur . 2022 . 1024869 Of the four genes , ARFIP2 , SH3GL2 , and SRGAP3 have a protective function . ARFIP2 is a member of the BAR family and plays a role in constitutive metalloproteinase ( MMP ) secretion from the trans - Golgi network . It is also involved in autophagy through the regulating of ATG9A vesicles that deliver phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase beta to the autophagosome initiation site ( 40 ) . SH3GL2 , also known as endophilin - A1 , is involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and may recruit other proteins to membranes with high curvature ( 41 ) . Zhu et al . found that SH3GL2 inhibits the migration and invasion behavior of glioma cells by negatively regulating STAT3 / MMP2 signaling . Moreover , SH3GL2 dysregulation has been associated with increased blood – brain barrier permeability , which may promote tumor progression ( 42 ) . SRGAP3 regulates the actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting actin dynamics speciﬁcally via lamellipodia formation ( 43 ) . High expression of ARFIP2 , SH3GL2 , and SRGAP3 help maintain cell tension and stiﬀness as well as inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis . Finally , PICK1 , a protein containing PDZ and BAR domains , inhibits actin polymerisation dependent on actin - related protein 2 / 3 and is involved in regulating the traﬃcking of many cell surface receptors ( 44 ) . Experimental evidence suggests that PICK1 is involved in promoting tumor growth and is associated with poor prognosis in human breast cancer ( 45 ) . In conclusion , our risk scores were negatively correlated with the expression levels of ARFIP2 , SH3GL2 , and SRGAP3 , whereas the risk scores were positively correlated with the expression level of PICK1 . Finally , qRT - PCR and IHC analysis conﬁrmed the diﬀerential expression of SH3GL2 in tissues of diﬀerent origin and its correlation with the prognosis of patients with glioma . Recently , the most advanced therapy for cancer is immunotherapy . According to the correlation analysis between the proposed model and immune cell inﬁltration , immune - related activities using ssGSEA and CIBERSORT , our prognostic signature could reﬂect the tumor immune microenvironment . NK cell inﬁltration levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the low - risk group , indicating greater antitumor ability . Subsequently after the TIDE analysis , it was found that the low - risk group had lower TIDE and immune dysfunction scores . These results suggest that patients in the low - risk group beneﬁt more from ICI therapy than those in the high - risk group . Conclusion Our prognostic signature was validated using six independent datasets and exhibited better predictive ability than TIDE and TIS scores . Our MTRGs related prognostic signature is , therefore , a promising predictive tool for better risk - stratiﬁcation of patients with LGG .
