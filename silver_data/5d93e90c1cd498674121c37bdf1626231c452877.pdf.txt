Letters RESEARCHLETTER Single - blind vs Double - blind Peer Review in the Setting of Author Prestige Most medical journals practice single - blind review 1 ( authors’ identities known to reviewers ) , but double - blind review ( au - thors’ identities masked to reviewers ) may improve the qual - ity of reviews . 2 Bias with single - blind review might be great - est in the setting of author or institutional prestige . 2 Methods | This study was approved by the University of Washingtoninstitutionalreviewboardandconductedat Clini - cal Orthopaedics and Related Research ( CORR ) , an orthopedic journal ( 2015 impact factor , 3 . 127 ; acceptance rate , 20 % ) thatallowsauthorstoselectsingle - blindordouble - blindpeer review . Potential reviewers ( based on expertise ) were identified from the journal’s database , informed that a study on peer review would occur in the coming year , and allowed to opt out . To avoid in - fluencing behavior , the details and timing of the study were notdescribedandthetrialwasregisteredaftercompletion . The protocol appears in the Supplement . BetweenJune2014andAugust2015 , reviewerswereran - domized via random number table ( 1 : 1 ratio in blocks of 8 ) to receive single - blind or double - blind versions of an otherwise identical fabricated manuscript , which was putatively writ - ten by 2 past presidents of the American Academy of Ortho - paedic Surgeons from prominent institutions . The manu - script described a prospective study on a nonclinical topic of broad interest ( team training to improve communication and safety in the operating room ) . Five subtle errors were in - cluded , rangingfromnumericalmistakestoanerrorinthecon - clusion , to determine differences in how critically the manu - script was examined . The primary outcome was recommendation of accep - tanceorrejection . Gradesof“accept”and“reject”weretaken at face value and , for grades of “major revision” and “minor revision , ”reviewers’commentswereanalyzedforlanguagerec - ommending rejection by researchers blinded to group alloca - tion . Secondary outcomes were the number of intentionally placederrorsdetectedandqualityscoresfortheMethods . Post hoc , scores for the other categories usually solicited by CORR were compared .

Reviewers were more likely to recommend acceptance when the prestigious authors’ names and institutions were visible ( single - blind review ) than when they were redacted ( double - blind review ) ( 87 % vs 68 % ; multivariable relative risk , 1 . 28 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 06 - 1 . 39 ] , P = . 02 ) ( Table 1 ) and also gave higher ratings for the methods and other categories ( Table 2 ) .

The study also examined peer reviewinthesettingofauthorandinstitutionalprestige , asitu - ation potentially yielding biased reviews . The study was conducted at a single orthopaedic journal ; generalizabilitytootherjournalsandotherfieldsofmedicine is unknown . With larger numbers , sex and nationality differ - encesbetweenthesingle - blindanddouble - blindgroupscould have been significant . The study used a single test manu - script ; resultscouldhavedifferedwithdifferentqualitymanu - scripts . Although reviewers could have identified the test manuscriptaspartofastudy , therewasnoevidencethatany - one did , and several steps were taken to prevent this includ - ing sending invitations in small batches and not inviting con - currentreviewersfromthesameinstitutionorreviewersfrom the high - prestige authors’ institutions .
