In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells , interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories ( CT ) , and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within CTs 1 . These models , however , provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function . Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid revolutions in the study of 3D genome organization . In particular , Hi - C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide 2 . In the present study , we investigated the 3D organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution . We identify large , megabase - sized local chromatin interaction domains , which we term “topological domains” , as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization . These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin . The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species , suggesting that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes . Lastly , we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF , housekeeping genes , tRNAs , and SINE retrotransposons , suggesting that these factors may play a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome . * To whom correspondence should be addressed : biren @ ucsd . edu .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t To study chromatin structure in mammalian cells , we performed the Hi - C experiment 2 in mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) , human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) , and human IMR90 fibroblasts . Together with Hi - C data for the mouse cortex generated in a separate study 3 , we analyzed over 1 . 7 billion read pairs of Hi - C data corresponding to pluripotent and differentiated cells ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . We normalized the Hi - C interactions for biases in the data ( Supplemental Figure 1 and 2 ) 4 . To validate the quality of our Hi - C data , we compared the data with previous 5C , 3C , and FISH results 5 – 7 . Our IMR90 Hi - C data shows a high degree of similarity when compared to a previously generated 5C dataset from lung fibroblasts ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . In addition , our mESC Hi - C data correctly recovered a previously described cell - type specific interaction at the Phc1 gene 6 ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Furthermore , the Hi - C interaction frequencies in mESCs are well - correlated with the mean spatial distance separating six loci as measured by 2D - FISH 7 ( Supplemental Figure 6 ) , demonstrating that the normalized Hi - C data can accurately reproduce the expected nuclear distance using an independent method . These results demonstrate that our Hi - C data is of high quality and accurately captures the higher order chromatin structures in mammalian cells . We next visualized 2D - interaction matrices using a variety of bin sizes to identify interaction patterns revealed as a result of our high sequencing depth ( Supplemental Figure 7 ) . We noticed that at bin sizes less than 100kb , highly self - interacting regions begin to emerge ( Figure 1a , Supplemental Figure 7 , seen as “triangles” on the heatmap ) . These regions , which we term “topological domains , ” are bounded by narrow segments where the chromatin interactions appear to end abruptly . We hypothesized that these abrupt transitions may represent boundary regions in the genome that separate topological domains . To systematically identify all such topological domains in the genome , we devised a simple statistic termed the “directionality index” ( DI ) to quantify the degree of upstream or downstream interaction bias for a genomic region , which varies considerably at the periphery of the topological domains ( Figure 1b , see supplemental methods for details ) . The DI was reproducible ( Supplemental Table 2 ) and pervasive , with 52 % of the genome having a DI that was not expected by random chance ( Figure 1c , FDR = 1 % ) . We then used a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) based on the DI to identify biased “states” and therefore infer the locations of topological domains in the genome ( Figure 1a , see supplemental methods for details ) . The domains defined by HMM were reproducible between replicates ( Supplemental Figure 8 ) . Therefore , we combined the data from the HindIII replicates and identified 2 , 200 topological domains in mESCs with a median size of 880kb that occupy ~ 91 % of the genome ( Supplemental Figure 9 ) . As expected , the frequency of intra - domain interactions is higher than inter - domain interactions ( Figure 1d , e ) . Similarly , FISH probes 7 in the same topological domain ( Figure 1f ) are closer in nuclear space than probes in different topological domains ( Figure 1g ) , despite similar genomic distances between probe pairs ( Figure 1h , i ) . These findings are best explained by a model of the organization of genomic DNA into spatial modules linked by short chromatin segments . We define the genomic regions between topological domains as either “topological boundary regions” or “unorganized chromatin” , depending on their sizes ( Supplemental Figure 9 ) . We next investigated the relationship between the topological domains and the transcriptional control process . The HoxA locus is separated into two compartments by an experimentally validated insulator 5 , 8 , 9 , which we observed corresponds to a topological domain boundary in both mouse ( Figure 1a ) and human ( Figure 2a ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that the boundaries of the topological domains might correspond to insulator or barrier elements . Dixon et al . Page 2 Nature .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Many known insulator or barrier elements are bound by the zinc - finger containing protein CTCF 10 – 12 . We see a strong enrichment of CTCF at the topological boundary regions ( Figure 2b , Supplemental Figure 10 ) , indicating that topological boundary regions share this feature of classical insulators . A classical boundary element is also known to stop the spread of heterochromatin . Therefore , we examined the distribution of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 in humans and mice in relation to the topological domains 13 , 14 . Indeed , we observe a clear segregation of H3K9me3 at the boundary regions that occurs predominately in differentiated cells ( Figure 2d , e , Supplemental Figure 11 ) . Since the boundaries we analyzed in Figure 2d are present in both pluripotent cells and their differentiated progeny , the topological domains and boundaries appear to “pre - mark” the end points of heterochromatic spreading . Therefore , the domains do not appear to be a consequence of the formation of heterochromatin . Taken together , the above observations strongly suggest that the topological domain boundaries correlate with regions of the genome displaying classical insulator and barrier element activity , thus revealing a potential link between the topological domains and transcriptional control in the mammalian genome . We compared the topological domains with previously described domain - like organizations of the genome , specifically with the A and B compartments described by Lieberman - Aiden et al . , 2 with Lamina - Associated Domains ( LADs ) 11 , 15 , replication time zones , 16 , 17 and Large Organized Chromatin K9 - modification ( LOCK ) domains 18 . In all cases , we can see that topological domains are related to , but independent from , each of these previously described domain - like structures ( Supplemental Figures 12 – 15 ) . Notably , a subset of the domain boundaries we identify appear to mark the transition between either LAD and non - LAD regions of the genome ( Figure 2f , Supplemental Figure 12 ) , the A and B compartments ( Supplemental Figure 13 , 14 ) , and early and late replicating chromatin ( Supplemental Figure 14 ) . Lastly , we can also confirm the previously reported similarities between the A and B compartments and early and late replication time zone ( Supplemental Figure 16 ) 17 . We next compared the locations of topological boundaries identified in both replicates of mESCs and cortex , or between both replicates of hESCs and IMR90 cells . In both human and mouse , the majority of the boundary regions are shared between cell types ( Figure 3a , Supplemental Figure 17a ) , suggesting that the overall domain structure between cell types is largely unchanged . At the boundaries called in only one cell type , we noticed that trend of upstream and downstream bias in the DI is still readily apparent and highly reproducible between replicates ( Supplemental figure 17b , c ) . We cannot determine if the differences in domain calls between cell types is due to noise in the data or due to biological phenomena , such as a change in the strength of the boundary region between cell types 19 . Regardless , these results suggest that the domain boundaries are largely invariant between cell types . Lastly , only a small fraction of the boundaries show clear differences between two cell types , suggesting that a relatively rare subset of boundaries may actually differ between cell types ( Supplemental Figure 18 ) . The stability of the domains between cell types is surprising given previous evidence showing cell type specific chromatin interactions and conformations 6 , 8 . To reconcile these results , we identified cell - type specific chromatin interactions between mouse ES cell and mouse cortex . We identified 9 , 888 dynamic interacting regions in the mouse genome based on 20kb binning using a binomial test with an empirical false discover rate of < 1 % based on random permutation of the replicate data . These dynamic interacting regions are enriched for differentially expressed genes , ( Figure 3b – d , Supplemental Figure 19 , Supplemental Table 5 ) . In fact , 20 % of all genes that undergo a 4 - fold change in gene expression are found at dynamic interacting loci . This is likely an underestimate , because by binning the genome at 20kb , any dynamic regulatory interaction less than 20kb will be missed . Lastly , > 96 % of dynamic interacting regions occur in the same domain ( Figure 3e ) . Therefore , we favor a Dixon et al . Page 3 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 17 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t model where the domain organization is stable between cell types , but the regions within each domain may be dynamic , potentially taking part in cell - type specific regulatory events . The stability of the domains between cell types prompted us to investigate if the domain structure is also conserved across evolution . To address this , we compared the domain boundaries between mouse ES cells and human ES cells using the UCSC liftover tool . The majority of boundaries appear to be shared across evolution ( 53 . 8 % of human boundaries are boundaries in mouse and 75 . 9 % of mouse boundaries are boundaries in humans , compared to 21 . 0 % and 29 . 0 % at random , p - value < 2 . 2×10 −16 , Fisher’s Exact Test ) ( Figure 3f ) . The syntenic regions in mouse and human in particular share a high degree of similarity in their higher order chromatin structure ( Figure 3g , h ) , indicating that there is conservation of genomic structure beyond the primary sequence of DNA . We explored what factors may contribute to the formation of topological boundary regions in the genome . While most topological boundaries are enriched for the binding of CTCF , only 15 % of CTCF binding sites are located within boundary regions ( Figure 2c ) . Thus , CTCF binding alone is insufficient to demarcate domain boundaries . We reasoned that additional factors might be associated with topological boundary regions . By examining the enrichment of a variety of histone modifications , chromatin binding proteins , transcription factors , around topological boundary regions in mESC , we observed that factors associated with active promoters and gene bodies are enriched at boundaries in both mouse and humans ( Figure 4a and Supplemental Figures 20 – 23 ) 20 , 21 . In contrast , non - promoter associated marks , such as H3K4me1 ( associated with enhancers ) and H3K9me3 , were not enriched or were specifically depleted at boundary regions ( Figure 4a ) . Furthermore , transcription start sites ( TSS ) and global run on sequencing ( GRO - Seq ) 22 signal were also enriched around topological boundaries ( Figure 4a ) . We found that “housekeeping genes” were particularly strongly enriched near topological boundary regions ( Figure 4b – d , See Supplemental Table 7 for complete GO terms enrichment ) . Additionally , the tRNA genes , which have the potential to function as boundary elements 23 , 24 , are also enriched at boundaries ( p - value < 0 . 05 , Fisher’s exact test ( Figure 4b ) . These results suggest that high levels of transcription activity may also contribute to boundary formation . In support of this , we can see examples of dynamic changes in H3K4me3 at or near some cell - type specific boundaries that are cell type - specific ( Supplemental Figure 24 ) . Indeed , boundaries associated with both CTCF and a housekeeping gene account for nearly a third of all topological boundaries in the genome ( Figure 4e , Supplemental Figure 24 ) Lastly , we analyzed the enrichment of repeat classes around boundary elements . We observed Alu / B1 and B2 SINE elements in mouse and Alu SINE elements in humans are enriched at boundary regions ( Figure 4a , Supplemental Figures 24 , 25 ) . In light of recent reports indicating that a SINE B2 element functions as a boundary in mice 25 , and SINE element retrotransposition may alter CTCF binding sites during evolution 26 , we believe this contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting a role for SINE elements in the organization of the genome . In summary , we show that the mammalian chromosomes are segmented into megabase - sized topological domains , consistent with some previous models of the higher order chromatin structure 1 , 27 , 28 . Such spatial organization appears to be a general property of the genome : it is pervasive throughout the genome , stable across different cell types and highly conserved between mice and humans . We have identified multiple factors that are associated with the boundary regions separating topological domains , including the insulator binding factor CTCF , housekeeping genes , SINE elements . The association of housekeeping genes with boundary regions extends Dixon et al . Page 4 Nature . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2012 November 17 .

The topological domains we identified are well conserved between mice and humans . This suggests that the sequence elements and mechanisms that are responsible for establishing higher order structures in the genome may be relatively ancient in evolution . A similar partitioning of the genome into physical domains has also been observed in Drosophila embryos 30 and in high - resolution studies of the X - inactivation center in mice ( termed Topologically Associated Domains or TADs ) 31 , suggesting that topological domains may be a fundamental organizing principle of metazoan genomes . Method Summary Cell Culture and Hi - C Experiments J1 mouse embryonic stem cells were grown on gamma - irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells under standard conditions ( 85 % High Glucose DMEM , 15 % HyClone FBS , 0 . 1mM non - essential amino acids , 0 . 1mM β - mercaptoethanol , 1mM Glutamine , LIF 500U / mL , + P / S ) . Before harvesting for Hi - C , J1 mESCs were passaged onto feeder free 0 . 2 % gelatin coated plates for at least 2 passages to rid the culture of feeder cells . H1 Human embryonic stem cells and IMR90 fibroblasts were grown as previously described 14 . Harvesting the cells for Hi - C was performed as previously described , with the only modification being that the adherent cell cultures were dissociated with trypsin prior to fixation . Sequencing and Mapping of Data Hi - C analysis and paired end libraries were prepared as previously described 2 and sequenced on the Illumina Hi - Seq2000 platform . Reads were mapped to reference human ( hg18 ) or mouse genomes ( mm9 ) , and non - mapping reads and PCR duplicates were removed . 2 - dimensional heat - maps were generated as previously described 2 .
