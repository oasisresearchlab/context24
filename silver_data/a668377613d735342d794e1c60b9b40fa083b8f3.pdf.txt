Whereas tilt - based approaches have previously been employed in single - particle studies , resulting reconstructions have generally been limited to low - to - moderate resolution 6 – 10 . Our implementation shows that it is now possible to obtain near - atomic resolution structures of preferentially oriented single - particle samples . We also introduce a tool to quantitatively assess directional resolution anisotropy of density maps using an algo - rithm based on the conventional Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) analysis ( see Online Methods ) . This program generates a set of 1D FSC curves computed over distinct angular directions and com - bines them into a 3D array that we term the 3D FSC . We evaluate this program using synthetic data and show that an isotropic pro - jection distribution produces a spherical 3D FSC ( Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Several aspects of our strategy deserve mention . First , indi - vidual fields of view are exposed only once ; in other words , all aspects of data collection are performed as in conventional single - particle analysis , with the sole exception that the goniometer is set to a defined nominal tilt angle . Second , contrast transfer function ( CTF ) estimation must take into account the defocus gradient across individual micrographs to obtain per - particle CTF values . We estimate per - particle CTFs using GCTF 11 for the described results , which provided the highest resolution reconstructions among the strategies evaluated ( see Online Methods ) . Third , we used gold substrates to minimize beam - induced movement at tilt 12 and motion correction of individual movie frames to account for any residual movements 13 . Fourth , to account for increased ice thickness and particle contrast reduction at tilt , we used a high - dose imaging strategy and exposure filtered the resulting frames 14 . Finally , the tilt collection scheme is independent of the sample or buffer and can be universally used . We tested our tilt collection strategy on the soluble portion of the small , 150 - kDa influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) trimer , which exhibits a single , highly preferred ‘top’ orientation on vitrified cryo - EM grids ( Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To evaluate how expected improvements in resolution and density isotropy would counterbalance the practical drawbacks associated with tilting , we collected images at 0° , 10° , 20° , 30° , 40° , and 50° tilts ; equally divided the data sets ; refined each set in an identi - cal manner ; and compared the resulting maps ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . 3D FSCs and their corresponding sphericities were cal - culated for each reconstruction to evaluate directional isotropy . Distinct directional resolution values obtained at a nominal cutoff threshold ( 0 . 143 ( ref . 15 ) ) were plotted as a histogram onto a addressing preferred specimen orientation in single - particle cryo - em through tilting Yong Zi Tan 1 , 2 , Philip R Baldwin 1 , Joseph H Davis 3 , James R Williamson 3 , Clinton S Potter 1 , 2 , Bridget Carragher 1 , 2 & Dmitry Lyumkis 4 We present a strategy for tackling preferred specimen orientation in single - particle cryogenic electron microscopy by employing tilts during data collection . We also describe a tool to quantify the resulting directional resolution using 3d fourier shell correlation volumes . We applied these methods to determine the structures at near - atomic resolution of the influenza hemagglutinin trimer , which adopts a highly preferred specimen orientation , and of ribosomal biogenesis intermediates , which adopt moderately preferred orientations . Recent methodological advances in single - particle cryogenic electron microscopy ( cryo - EM ) have enabled the elucidation of biological macromolecular structures to near - atomic resolu - tions . Despite numerous advances , preferred particle orientation represents a recurring problem for the cryo - EM field 1 , 2 . Ideally , macromolecules adopt random orientations within a layer of vit - reous ice supported by an EM grid ; which , in principle , results in isotropic distribution of angular projection orientations . This , however , is rarely true in practice , presumably on account of surface properties of the molecules that cause specific regions to preferentially adhere to the air – water interface or substrate support 3 . Preferred specimen orientations result in nonuniform distribution of angular projection views of the individual parti - cles , a proportional undersampling of Fourier components within the final reconstruction , and an overall loss of resolution parallel to the preferred orientation axis ( a ‘smearing effect’ of the map 4 ) . In extreme cases , reconstructions have large amounts of missing information in Fourier space , or they may completely misrepre - sent the true structure of the imaged object . These effects can be collectively described by directional resolution anisotropy 5 . Prior efforts have attempted to address preferred specimen orientation in cryo - EM using a number of different approaches ( Supplementary Note 1 ) .

Map - to - model 3D directional and global FSCs were also included to specifically evaluate external consistency to a common refer - ence ( X - ray structure of HA , PDB : 3WHE ) , and the FSC external consistency contrasts with the internal self - consistency of conven - tional half - map - based resolutions . We observe that , in the absence of any tilt or at lower angle tilts , reconstructions exhibit a bulk loss of axial density concomitant with elongation along the Z - axis characteristic of poor Z - axis resolution . As expected , at higher angle tilts , these effects are ameliorated with improved isotropy and are quantitatively captured by both half - map and especially map - to - model 3D FSCs , which in these examples provide a better evaluation of the accuracy of the reconstruction ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) .

These results are consistent with the general idea that the overall fidelity of the maps characterized by low - resolution features improves with better density isotropy , but that high - resolution features suffer from the practical disadvantages associated with tilting . Having observed quantitative improvements in global and direc - tional resolution from HA data collected at high tilt angles , we proceeded to evaluate the possibility of using tilts for near - atomic - resolution single - particle analysis . A larger stack of particles from untilted ( control ) and 40° - tilted micrographs were collected and processed using the gold - standard refinement approach imple - mented within the latest generation software 16 to produce maps ( Fig . 1a ) at nominally near - atomic resolution ( 3 . 4 Å and 4 . 4 Å , respectively ) . Visually , however , the reconstruction from untilted images was severely elongated along the Z - axis , and this produced artifactual densities and influenced apparent missing axial den - sity at typical display thresholds . In contrast , the reconstruction from 40° - tilted images was a far more accurate representation of the real HA trimer structure . Furthermore , the reconstruction from untilted images displayed signs of overfitting . These signs , largely absent in the reconstruction from tilted images , included ( i ) streaking at low - density thresholds ( Fig . 1 arrows ii , v ) ; ( ii ) a sharp drop ( Fig . 1 arrows iii , vi ) that is characteristic of overfitting exhibited by the global FSC 17 ; and , most tellingly , ( iii ) the map - to - model global and 3D FSCs were much worse than the half - map FSCs . We reasoned that this overfitting also likely caused the side views within the Euler distribution plot ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . To test this , we combined the particles from untilted and tilted images to maintain a more accurate den - sity throughout refinement ( Fig . 1b ) . The same particles from untilted images that appeared as side views were now mostly clas - sified as top views ( compare arrows i and iv in Fig . 1a , b ) , which supported the conclusion that the highly anisotropic data set also led to some overfitting . Furthermore , the combined reconstruc - tion showed that , despite doubling the number of particles , the resulting density and its associated resolutions ( measured using an external reference ) actually worsened ( i . e . , more elongation and signs of overfitting ) . These results demonstrate that pre - ferred orientation can result in a reconstruction with apparent high resolution that is completely incorrect .

The issue of directional resolution anisotropy is also alleviated . Using the entire particle stack from 40° - tilted images , we obtained a reconstruction resolved to 4 . 2 and 4 . 4 Å using half - map and map - to - model criteria , respectively ( Fig . 2 ) . All image - processing operations , including the generation of an initial model , were performed de novo . The resulting map exhibited regions with bulky side chains , glycans , alpha - helical pitch , and beta - strand separation ( Fig . 2 ) . The missing cone , although still present , did not significantly affect the interpretability of the reconstruction , a scenario that is qualitatively similar to our synthetic data results comparing 60° and 90° tilts ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . To test the generality of our approach , we applied our tilted collection strategy to bacterial large ribosomal subunit assembly intermediates 18 that also exhibit preferred orientation , although less severely than HA ( Supplementary Figs . 6 – 10 ) . While the exact gains differed slightly across the four structural interme - diates ( superclasses ) , in part on account of different degrees of preferred orientation , we consistently observed an improvement in global and directional resolution with tilts , nominally ranging from ~ 0 . 2 – 0 . 7 Å , as well as expected improvements to isotropy ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . To determine the limits of tilting , we refined a data set from 50° - tilted images combined from homo - geneous regions within all four superclasses , and we focused on mutually occupied ribosomal proteins . Using 17 , 170 particles , we resolved multiple proteins to ~ 4 – 5 Å resolution , with the best regions at ~ 4 . 2 Å ; and the reconstruction was characterized by a nearly spherical 3D FSC ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . The optimal collection strategy is a trade - off between degree of directional isotropy ( higher tilts lead to better Fourier space sampling ) and resolution ( higher tilts lead to loss of high - spatial - frequency information ) . Based on our experiments , sam - ples adopting extreme preferred orientations benefit from data collection at a single high tilt because of the amount of miss - ing Fourier information . Incorporation of untilted data , without proper weighting , may lead to overfitting . It will thus be use - ful to incorporate anisotropic filters and orientation - weighting schemes during density refinement 19 or reconstruction 20 . For samples adopting less preferred orientations , smaller tilt angles , or combinations of tilt angles , this method provides improvements in both isotropy and global resolution . We thus conclude that single - particle data characterized by preferred orientation may generally be collected using some tilts , especially as the practical issues associated with tilting are addressed in future work . As is widely accepted , global resolution alone is insufficient to determine map quality . Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 11d , e demonstrate that smearing along the preferred orientation axis— a manifestation of directional anisotropy—obscures features like beta - strand separation and alpha - helical pitch . Importantly , loss of directional resolution may adversely affect researchers’ ability to build and / or refine models into EM density maps . In addition to displaying Euler angle distributions , quantitative directional isotropy analysis should thus be a useful metric for evaluating cryo - EM density maps ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . In conclusion , we demonstrate that tilted cryo - EM single - particle analysis quantitatively improves directional isotropy in samples exhibiting preferred orientation . We also present the 3D FSC program , which provides a method to evaluate the degree of resolution anisotropy in any single - particle cryo - EM reconstruction . These methods , as they are sample independent and simple to implement , should be immediately applicable to many preferentially oriented cryo - EM specimens , including integral membrane proteins 21 . methods Methods , including statements of data availability and any associated accession codes and references , are available in the online version of the paper .

A general protocol for employing tilts for single - particle data acquisition and analysis is available as a Supplementary Protocol and has been deposited into Protocol Exchange 22 . Notably , with the excep - tion of setting the microscope at a defined tilt angle and taking into account the defocus gradient across the micrograph during CTF estimation , all other data collection and image processing operations can be performed normally , as in conventional single - particle analysis . Statistics . For calculations of Fourier shell correlations ( FSC ) , the FSC cutoff criterion of 0 . 143 ( ref . 15 ) was used . Three - dimensional Fourier shell correlation algorithm . We will here describe the meaning of the 3D FSC plot . The usual FSC between two maps ( in Fourier space ) F and G is given by FSC ( ) ( ) * ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) | | k F k G k N k N k k k F G = ′ ′ ′ = ∑   1 Here | |  ′ k is the magnitude of the spatial frequency vector  ′ k . The normalizations are such that , when F and G agree , then FSC ( k ) = 1 : N k F k F k F k k ( ) ( ) * ( ) ( ) | | = ′ ′ ′ ≅ ∑    2 N k G k G k G k k ( ) ( ) * ( ) ( ) | | = ′ ′ ′ ≅ ∑    3 The sums in these expressions are given over all the data k ′ such that the distance of the points to the Fourier origin is given approximately by k . The meaning of this expression is that FSC is nearly equal to one when the normalized maps are similar . It can be viewed as the cross term of the differences between the normalized maps over the shell . On account of the Friedel sym - metry and the integration over the entire shell , the FSC is real . In the continuous limit , the sum reduces to the integration over a shell of data . If , instead , we wanted to investigate the agreement of F and G over a limited angular range over the shell , then we could alter these quantities to define a conical measure of FSC , which we call 3D FSC . We believe this is essentially the same as the conical measure discussed recently by Diebolder et al . 23 , except a hard cutoff is used here instead of the soft one that intro - duces another parameter . FSC dq dq dq ( ) ( ) * ( ) ( ) | | , | | cos , ,        k F k G k N k N k k k k F G = ′ ′ ′ = ′⋅ ≥ ∑ ddq ( ) ( )  k 4 N k F k F k F k k k k , | | , | | cos ( ) ( ) * ( ) ( ) dq dq       = ′ ′ ′ ≅ ′⋅ ≥ ∑ 5 N k G k G k F k k k k , | | , | | cos ( ) ( ) * ( ) ( ) dq dq       = ′ ′ ′ ≅ ′⋅ ≥ ∑ 6 Now the sums are performed over all those values of k ′ that are nearly on the same shell as k and sufficiently close to the direction as governed by the parameter dq . A series of dq values were tested ; ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 6 ) and a value of 20° was chosen , as it provides good averaging prop - erties while still allowing for discrimination of anisotropic FSC patterns . Because of the averaging , the patterns on the surface of a sphere are mostly of a low angular frequency . The result , which is conceptually similar to the conical resolution plots that have been used in tomography 19 , 23 , 24 , is a set of 1D Fourier shell correlation curves computed over distinct angular directions , which can be compiled into a 3D array that we term the 3D FSC . This 3D FSC can be visualized as a 3D density ( e . g . , in Chimera ) and at a fixed threshold value . Here , we chose to present the 3D FSC by show - ing a central slice through the isosurface ( thresholded at 0 . 143 ( ref . 15 ) ) , as this helps to show the shape and degree of spheri - cal deformation along the direction of the slice , and the shape and degree in turn represent the degree of directional anisotropy . Alternative representations of directional resolution have also been proposed by Diebolder et al . 23 and Dudkina et al . 24 . Our numerical implementation is indeed a straightforward modifica - tion of the FSC / FRC code in SPARX 25 / EMAN2 ( ref . 26 ) . This 3D FSC evaluation , which is performed in Fourier space and meas - ures directional resolution , is distinct from local resolution meas - ures 25 , 27 , which have no relationship to direction . The two metrics are independent of , but complementary to , one another . In order to quantify the degree of anisotropy of this 3D FSC , spherical Fibonacci mapping using 100 points was performed . The first crossing at a FSC of 0 . 143 ( ref . 15 ) was used to deter - mine the resolution at these 100 points ; and a histogram of these points was plotted , along with the spread of directional resolution values defined by ± 1 σ from the mean . Sphericity was also used as a measure of the degree of anisotropy . To calculate sphericity , the 3D FSC was first thresholded ( at 0 . 5 ) and Gaussian smoothed by 2 pixels in Chimera . Thereafter , the volume and surface area of this smoothed volume was derived and used to calculate the sphericity using the formula 28 below : Sphericity volume Surfacearea = × p 1 3 2 3 6 7 / / ( ) ( ) Synthetic data set . A molecular PDB model of the HA trimer ( PDB : 3WHE ) was first converted to a 2 . 62 Å density map using EMAN 26 . 10 , 000 synthetic particles were then projected from the molecular density map at specific theta angles 30° , 60° , and 90° and with a uniform 5° distribution of phi angles . A fourth data set was generated with uniform distribution of theta and phi projec - tion directions at 5° increments . The synthetic data was generated as previously described 29 . Briefly , the projections were randomly rotated ( randomizing the psi Euler angle ) and shifted , followed by the addition of white Gaussian noise , modulation of the noisy images by a contrast transfer and envelope function , and another layer of white Gaussian noise . The final signal - to - noise ratio was estimated at ~ 0 . 05 , in accordance with real cryo - EM data 30 . In order to simulate real experimental errors during recon - struction and mimic the effects of Euler angle uncertainty , all Euler angles and both X and Y shifts were randomly perturbed . The perturbation value was randomly selected from a Gaussian dis - tribution with a mean of 0 and a s . d . of ± 4° for all Euler angles and ± 2 pixels for all shifts ; the true Euler angles and shift values were then modified by adding the above perturbation . Following per - turbation , two rounds of Frealign 29 , 31 refinement were performed .

FSC between the masked half maps was calculated using EMAN . Materials , instrumentation , and data acquisition for HA Trimer and LSU bL17 dep . The recombinantly expressed and purified H3N2 Hong Kong hemagglutinin trimer ( A / Hong Kong / 1 / 1968 ) was obtained from MyBioSource ( catalog number : MBS434205 ) . 3 µ l of the sample at 0 . 75 mg / ml was added to a plasma - cleaned ( Gatan Solarus ) 1 . 2 µ m hole , 1 . 3 µ m spacing holey gold grid ( made in house ) and plunge frozen in liquid ethane using the Cryoplunge 3 system ( Gatan ) operating at > 80 % humidity , 298 K ambient temperature . The bacterial large ribosomal subunit depleted of bL17 protein ( LSU bL17 dep sample ) was obtained by growing E . coli cells without the L17 gene , supplanted with a titratable plasmid containing the L17 gene , with details described in ref . 18 . The cells were lysed and the crude lysate separated with a sucrose gradient . 3 µ l of the fraction containing the intermediates was concentrated using a 100 kDa MW filter ( Amicon ) and vitrified in the same manner as the HA trimer . Both samples were imaged on a Titan Krios electron micro - scope ( FEI ) equipped with a K2 summit direct detector ( Gatan ) at 1 . 31 Å per pixel in counting mode using the Leginon software package 32 . The HA trimer sample was collected at a dose of ~ 82 e − / Å 2 across 100 frames for a dose rate of ~ 7 . 0 e − / pix / sec , using a defocus range of −0 . 75 µ m to −3 µ m , with data being acquired over four sessions . A total of 2 , 469 raw micrographs were col - lected . The LSU bL17 dep sample was collected at a dose of ~ 34 e − / Å 2 across 50 frames for a dose rate of ~ 5 . 8 e − / pixel / s using a defocus range of −0 . 8 µ m to −2 µ m , with data being acquired over three sessions . A total of 3 , 906 raw micrographs were collected . Movies were collected from 0° to 50° tilt at 10° increments . The negative tilt side of the goniometer was used , as it is the more stable tilt direction of this particular microscope’s goniometer . Data processing for per - tilt analysis of HA Trimer and LSU bL17 dep . For the first set of single - particle analyses at all the various tilts from 0° to 50° ( per - tilt analysis , Supplementary Figs . 4 , 7 – 10 ) , the first three sessions for the HA trimer sample ( consisting of 121 0° , 131 10° , 569 20° , 218 30° , 242 40° , and 237 50° micrographs ) and all the three sessions for the LSU bL17 dep sample ( consisting of 1 , 220 0° , 574 10° , 559 20° , 449 30° , 527 40° , and 577 50° micrographs ) were used . For both samples , CTF estimation was performed initially with CTFFind3 and CTFTilt 33 . Particle extraction was performed reference - free first using DoG picker 34 . 2D classification was then performed using Xmipp CL2D 35 . Good class averages were then selected and used for template picking with FindEM 36 . 2D classification was then performed again with Xmipp CL2D . Initial models for both samples using 2D classification class averages were generated ab initio using Optimod 37 . All these software packages were accessed through the Appion pipeline 38 . A total of 364 , 949 particles for the HA trimer sample and 332 , 546 particles for the LSU bL17 dep sample were obtained after 2D classification . For analysis of the data set , an equal number of particles from micrographs at each tilt angle ( 0° , 10° , 20° , 30° , 40° , and 50° ) were randomly selected , resulting in 155 , 172 particles for the HA trimer data set and 150 , 018 particles for the LSU bL17 dep data set ( 25 , 862 and 25 , 003 particles per tilt angle , respectively ) . For both samples , the selected particles were pooled together and iteratively classified in 3D in order to remove bad particles ; for the LSU bL17 dep sample , 3D classification additionally produced four distinct superclasses of intermediates ( B , C , D , and E 18 ) . Finally , the particles from both data sets were again equalized to ensure the distributions of defocus values were consistent across tilts ( 0° , 10° , 20° , 30° , 40° , and 50° ) . This resulted in a total of 78 , 000 HA trimers ( 13 , 000 particles each tilt ) and 5 , 400 particles for each supergroup B , C , D , E , and for each tilt angle within the LSU bL17 dep data set . For both HA and LSU bL17 dep , CTFs were estimated using either CTFFind3 alone , CTFFind3 for untilted micrographs and CTFTilt for tilted micrographs ( when using CTFFind3 or CTFTilt , the per - particle CTFs were computed using the geometric extrapolation based on the average CTF across the micrograph , nominal tilt angle , and an experimentally derived tilt axis ) , and GCTF 11 . In our hands , GCTF provided the best resolution for both HA and LSU bL17 dep samples and it was therefore used for all subsequent studies herein . We also evaluated different motion correction programs ( Unblur 14 , Rubinstein & Brubaker 39 , and MotionCor2 ( ref . 13 ) ) , with and without exposure weighting 14 ; and a standardized refinement ( see below ) was performed . In our hands , for all five reconstructions , MotionCor2 with exposure weighting produced the highest resolution and was used for subsequent analysis . In order to refine particles from the individual tilts ab initio and separately from one another , the HA trimer reconstruction at this stage was low - pass filtered to 30 Å and used as an initial model for Relion refinement of each individual data set from tilted images . The same was done for the LSU bL17 dep , except the model was low - pass filtered to 40 Å . Using these initial models , Relion 3D refine - ments were performed for each of the five data sets ( HA trimer , LSU bL17 dep class B , C , D , and E ) collected from each individual tilt ( 0° , 10° , 20° , 30° , 40° , and 50° ) . The mask for the HA trimer was generated using the HA trimer initial model , which was low - pass filtered , binarized , extended by 9 pixels using ‘relion _ mask _ create’ , and modified with a soft Gaussian edge of 6 pixels using apply _ mask . exe ( distributed with the Frealign software suite ) . The mask for all four LSU bL17 dep classes was created using the B - class initial model , as it comprises the homogeneous region across all four LSU bL17 dep superclasses ( details described in ref . 18 ) . The model was binarized and extended by 2 pixels using relion _ mask _ create and given a soft Gaussian edge of 4 pixels using apply _ mask . exe . The FSC between the masked half maps was calculated using EMAN 26 . Sharpening of the reconstructions was per - formed using bfactor . exe , which is distributed with Frealign . The best bfactor value was deduced by visual inspection of the map after sharpening with bfactor values in multiples of 50 . In order to calculate the map - to - model FSC , the atomic structure of H3N2 HA Trimer ( PDB : 3WHE ) and the atomic structure of the ribosomal proteins and rRNA helices ( PDB : 4YBB ) present in all four LSU bL17 dep superclasses 18 were used for their respective reconstructions . For the latter , the rationale for only using ribosomal proteins and rRNA helices present in all superclasses is to ensure any observed map differences are not due to structural heterogeneity . The models were converted to density maps at 2 . 62 Å using Chimera 40 and aligned to the reconstruction . The density map was then binarized to a mask doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 4347 nature methods using EMAN and then applied to the sharpened reconstruction with a soft Gaussian edge of 6 pixels using apply _ mask . exe . The FSC between the model density map and the masked reconstruc - tions was calculated using EMAN to give the map - to - model FSC . Similar relative results for all resolution calculations were obtained using shaped masks ( as above ) and spherical masks , although the exact FSC values differed slightly . Data processing comparing 0° and 40° tilts for HA trimer analysis . For the second set of single - particle analyses for the HA trimer from micrographs collected at 0° and 40° tilt ( Fig . 1a ) , all four sessions for the HA trimer sample ( consisting of 466 0° and 847 40° micrographs ) were used . Using the 20 most populated 2D Relion class averages , Gautomatch ( developed by K . Zhang ) was used to select particles , with 226 , 468 particles picked for 0° micrographs ( ~ 486 picks per micrograph ) and 287 , 820 particles picked for 40° micrographs ( ~ 340 picks per micrograph ) . The dis - crepancy in the average number of selected particles between the 0° and 40° micrographs is caused by the use of the same particle - picking parameters for both sets of data sets for consistency . By visual inspection , more particles could have been picked from the 40° micrographs ; but because there were already more particles selected from these than from the 0° micrographs , the particle - picking parameters were not further optimized . Manual mask - ing of bad regions resulted in 214 , 490 particle picks left for 0° micrographs and 235 , 049 particle picks left for 40° micrographs . Per - particle CTF was used for CTF estimation , and MotionCor2 with exposure weighting was applied for motion correction . Two rounds of 2D classification were then performed , first using Xmipp CL2D ( within the Appion framework ) and then using Relion 2D , and bad class averages were discarded , resulting in 137 , 701 0° tilt particles and 158 , 432 40° tilt particles . Particles from both data sets were then equalized to ensure the distribu - tions of defocus values were consistent across tilts , resulting in two 130 , 000 particle stacks for 0° and 40° tilt . Both particle stacks were put through Relion 3D refinement using the standard HA trimer initial model used in the per - tilt analysis . Sharpening , masking , half - map FSC , and map - to - model FSC calculations were performed as described above for the per - tilt analysis . For the combined data set ( Fig . 1b ) , the two equalized stacks of 130 , 000 particles from micrographs at 0° and 40° tilt were merged to form a stack of 260 , 000 particles and put through the same refinement and postprocessing procedure as above . Data processing for ab initio 40° - tilt HA trimer . For the ab initio 40° - tilt HA - trimer reconstruction ( Fig . 2 ) , the full stack of 158 , 432 particles from micrographs at 40° tilt from the HA trimer ( 0° and 40° ) analysis was used . CryoSPARC 41 was used to generate an ab initio model . Using a 30 Å low - pass filtered version of this model , the particles were refined using Relion 3D refinement . After the first round of refinement , particles with a maximum probability score of under 0 . 07 ( ref . 42 ) were removed , resulting in a stack of 125 , 077 particles . These particles were put through a final round of Relion 3D refinement using a 15 Å low - pass filtered reconstruction from the first round of refinement . Data processing for ab initio 50° - tilt LSU bL17 dep . For the ab ini - tio 50° - tilt LSU bL17 dep reconstruction ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , an ab initio initial model was generated from all the particles from micrographs at 50° tilt from per - tilt analysis ( 17 , 170 in total ) using SIMPLE 43 . The rationale for combining the particles was to obtain the highest possible resolution for the most homogeneous regions of the data set at a high tilt angle . The initial model was low - pass filtered to 40 Å and used for Relion 3D refinement . The resulting Euler angles from this Relion 3D refinement were then converted to Frealign for ten further rounds of mode 1 refinement and five more rounds of mode 3 refinement with DANG of 3 . The masking , sharpening , and FSC calculations were identical to the other LSU bL17 dep reconstructions . Local resolution was estimated using the sxlocres . py function within the SPARX 25 package . Code availability .
