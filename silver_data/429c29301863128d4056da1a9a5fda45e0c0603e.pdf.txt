PIEZO1 loss - of - function mutations in patients are associated with congenital lym - phedema with pleural effusion . However , the mechanistic link be - tween PIEZO1 function and the development or function of the lymphatic system is currently unknown . Here , we analyzed two mouse lines lacking PIEZO1 in endothelial cells ( via Tie2Cre or Lyve1Cre ) and found that they exhibited pleural effusion and died postnatally . Strikingly , the number of lymphatic valves was dramatically re - duced in these mice . Lymphatic valves are essential for ensuring proper circulation of lymph . Mechanical forces have been implicated in the development of lymphatic vasculature and valve formation , but the identity of mechanosensors involved is unknown . Expression of FOXC2 and NFATc1 , transcription factors known to be required for lymphatic valve development , appeared normal in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice . However , the process of protrusion in the valve leaflets , which is associated with collective cell migration , actin polymerization , and remodeling of cell – cell junctions , was impaired in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice . Consistent with these genetic findings , activation of PIEZO1 by Yoda1 in cultured lymphatic endothelial cells induced active remod - eling of actomyosin and VE - cadherin + cell – cell adhesion sites . Our analysis provides evidence that mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1 is a key regulator of lymphatic valve formation . PIEZO1 | mechanotransduction | ion channel | lymphatic system | valve formation T he lymphatic system is essential for fluid homeostasis in the body . Lymphatic vessels collect extracellular fluid from the interstitial space and drain it back to the venous circulation ( 1 , 2 ) . The lymphatic system is also involved in absorption of fat from the gut and is important for coordinating adaptive immune responses . Its dysfunction often results in peripheral lymphedema as well as pleural effusions and ascites . Lymphatic valves are required to ensure unidirectional flow of lymph in collecting vessels that are composed of contractile units known as lymphangions . The valves are formed from lymphatic endothelial cells ( LECs ) , the main component of the lymphatic vasculature . Mouse genetic studies have identified transcription factors , adhesion proteins , and mediators of intercellular signaling as essential components for the development and maintenance of lymphatic vasculature and valves ( 1 , 3 – 5 ) . In addition , the contribution of mechanical forces to the development and maintenance of the lymphatic vasculature has been described ( 6 ) . Accumulating evidence suggests that genes involved in valve formation are up - regulated when LECs are exposed to shear stress ( 7 , 8 ) . However , it still remains unclear how mechanical stimuli are converted into intracellular signals in the lymphatic endothelium . Recently , studies of patients with familial lymphatic dysfunction suggested that mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1 is required for lymphatic system function . Specifically , homozygous and com - pound heterozygous mutations in PIEZO1 were identified among patients suffering from persistent lymphedema , plural effusions , and ascites associated with congenital lymphatic dysplasia ( 9 – 11 ) . PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are nonselective cation channels activated by mechanical forces applied to the cell membrane , such as fluid shear stress and cell stretching ( 12 – 16 ) . PIEZOs are large proteins containing more than 2 , 000 amino acids with 38 transmembrane domains per protomer . PIEZO1 trimeric channels form a three - bladed propeller shape with a curved transmembrane region as revealed by cryoelectron microscopy . It has been proposed that a change in membrane tension induces conformational change of these propellers and leads to channel pore opening ( 17 – 20 ) . PIEZO2 functions as the key mechanotransducer for light touch sensation , proprioception , and control of respiration ( 21 – 24 ) . PIEZO1 , on the other hand , is expressed in endothelial cells , including LECs , and plays essential roles in developing blood vessels in mouse embryos and in flow - mediated vasoconstriction in adult mice ( 8 , 15 , 25 – 28 ) . In addition , PIEZO1 in red blood cells controls cell volume regulation , and gain - of - function mutations in PIEZO1 cause dehydrated RBCs and some protection from malaria infection in mice and human ( 29 – 32 ) . In this study , we analyzed mouse lines lacking PIEZO1 in endothelial cells and found that PIEZO1 is re - quired for formation of lymphatic valves , highlighting the physio - logical importance of PIEZO1 in the lymphatic system . Results Postnatal Pleural Effusion and Lethality of Endothelial - Specific Piezo1 Conditional Knockout Mice . We previously reported that , when PIEZO1 is constitutively and globally ablated ( Piezo1 − / − ) , mice Significance PIEZOs are mechanically activated cation channels . Recently , loss - of - function mutations of human PIEZO1 were found among patients with familial lymphedema , suggesting a requirement of PIEZO1 in the lymphatic system . In this paper , utilizing mouse models lacking PIEZO1 in endothelial cells , we show that this ion channel is required for the formation of lymphatic valves , a key structure for proper circulation of lymph in the body . The re - quirement of PIEZO1 in valve formation provides mechanistic insight on how PIEZO1 variants cause lymphatic dysfunction in patients . This study also extends the relevance of PIEZOs beyond acute signaling molecules ( e . g . , touch sensation ) and highlights the importance of these ion channels in controlling morpho - logical / structural specification during development .

To investigate the role of PIEZO1 in the lymphatic system in detail , we gen - erated two mouse lines in which PIEZO1 was deleted specifically in endothelial cells . The Tie2Cre mouse line , in which Cre recombinase is expressed in vascular endothelial cells , including both blood ( BECs ) and lymphatic endothelial cells ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 A ) , was crossed with Piezo1 flox / flox mice to generate Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice ( 29 , 33 ) . Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice were born at the expected ratio [ ac - tual : 23 . 9 % ( 28 / 117 ) , expected : 25 % ] , suggesting that they survive past embryonic development . Previously , endothelial - specific deletion of PIEZO1 in mice was reported to cause embryonic lethality ( 25 ) . The variation in phenotype between the two studies could potentially be due to differences in genetic back - ground ( 25 , 29 , 34 ) . In our colony , most Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice died within 2 wk after birth ( Fig . 1 A ) . The body weight of the Piezo1 - deficient mice was slightly less than control littermates during postnatal days ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B ) . Among human patients with PIEZO1 loss - of - function variants , pleural effusion , a sign of defect in the lymphatic system , especially damage of lymphatic vessels close to the chest cavity , has been reported . Consistently , pleural effusion was evident in 1 - wk - old Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice ( Fig . 1 B and C ) . The second mouse line we utilized was initially aimed to more specifically ablate PIEZO1 in lymphatic endothelial cells . Here , Cre recombinase was expressed from the locus of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 ( Lyve1 ) , a widely used marker for LECs ( 5 , 35 – 37 ) . High efficiency of Cre - mediated recombination of loxP sites in LECs was reported with this line ; however , re - combination in a subset of BECs was also reported ( 35 ) . We ex - amined the specificity of Cre activity in various endothelial cells by crossing the Lyve1Cre line to the Ai9 line ( loxP - stop - loxP - tdTomato reporter in the ROSA26 locus ) ( 38 ) . In the mesentery of Lyve1Cre ; Ai9 mice , tdTomato signal was detected in arteries and veins , as well as lymphatic vessels ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 A ) . These results were identical to what was observed for tdTomato signal in Tie2Cre ; Ai9 mesentery ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 A ) . Therefore , Lyve1Cre ; Piezo1 cKO and Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO both appear to delete PIEZO1 from LECs as well as BECs , although the efficiency of recombi - nation in BECs might be less in Lyve1Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice ( 35 ) . Regardless , we used the Lyve1Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice to confirm our results obtained from Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice . Lyve1Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice showed postnatal lethality around 1 – 2 wk after birth and pleural effusion 1 wk after birth ( Fig . 1 D – F ) , resembling Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice . In human PIEZO1 - deficient patients , respiratory defects resulting from severe pleural effu - sion were also reported ( 9 ) . In line with this , three out of four Lyve1Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice exhibited collapsed alveoli at postnatal day 7 ( P7 ) , while this was never observed in WT mice ( SI Ap - pendix , Fig . S2 B ) . Taken together , these mouse models exhibit similar defects in patients with PIEZO1 loss - of - function muta - tions , suggesting that a role of PIEZO1 in the lymphatic system is likely conserved between human and mouse . Reduced Number of Lymphatic Valves in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO and Lyve1Cre ; Piezo1 cKO Mice . Next , we checked the structure of the lymphatic vasculature of Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO and Lyve1Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice in the mesentery , where the development of lymphatic vasculature is well studied ( 7 ) . At P4 , it was evident that lym - phatic valves , which are marked by clusters of Prox1 high nuclei and strong signal of integrin α 9 , were drastically reduced in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice compared with WT littermates ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . Reduced numbers of lymphatic valves were also ob - served in P4 Lyve1Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice , compared with WT lit - termates ( Fig . 2 C and D ) . Therefore , endothelial PIEZO1 is required for the formation and / or maintenance of lymphatic valves . Given the similar phenotypes observed with Tie2Cre and Lyve1Cre , we performed the rest of the analysis with Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice . Impaired Lymphatic Valve Protrusion in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO Mice . Our results suggested an almost complete absence of lymphatic valves at postnatal day 4 . Next , we checked the development of lym - phatic valves in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO embryos . The development of lymphatic valves is divided into several stages ( 7 , 39 ) . Up - regulation of Prox1 expression ( Prox1 high ) is a marker for cells which will form valve leaflets ( 7 , 39 ) . First , a few Prox1 high LECs appear in the vessel ( stage 1 ) . Next , the number of Prox1 high cells increases and they align in the shape of a ring in the vessel ( stage 2 ) . The rings of Prox1 high cells are often formed around branching points within vessels . Then , clusters of Prox1 high cells further develop into valves . During this process , Prox1 high cells align perpendicular to the vessel ’ s axis ( reorientation ) ( stage 2 . 5 ) . Reoriented Prox1 high cells migrate toward the lumen ( valve protrusion ) , resulting in disk - like structures ( 39 ) and constriction Fig . 1 .

The valves continue to elongate until they form V - like shapes with leaflets in association with a thick ex - tracellular matrix core ( stage 4 ) . Valve development is known to commence earlier in larger diameter , more proximal lymphatic vessels . Therefore , at embryonic day 18 . 5 ( E18 . 5 ) , valves at different stages of development can normally be identified in different segments of mouse mesentery . We first compared the number of valve - forming regions ( VFRs ) , containing ≥ 10 Prox1 high nuclei , in E18 . 5 mesentery between WT and Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO embryos . In contrast to the nearly complete loss of fully formed valves at P4 , we observed no significant difference in the number of VFRs between WT and Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mesenteries at E18 . 5 ( Fig . 3 A and B ) . Next , we checked the proportion of VFRs at different stages based on the direction of the major axis of Prox1 high nuclei and the presence of constric - tion in the vessel ( Fig . 3 C ) . In the mesentery of E18 . 5 Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO embryos , there was an overrepresentation of valves at stage 2 at the expense of stages 3 and 4 , compared with WT littermates . The percentage of valves at intermediate phase ( stage 2 . 5 ) was not different between Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO and WT mesenteries ( Fig . 3 D ) . Next , we examined the structure of VFRs of Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO embryos in more detail . Previous studies demonstrated that valve protrusion results from collec - tive cell migration of Prox1 high cells , which is associated with actin polymerization and formation of cell – cell junctions ( 39 , 40 ) . In the optical cross - sections at VFRs of WT embryos , Prox1 high nuclei were observed not only on the wall of the vessel , but also in the more central regions , a sign of cell migration , which results in valve protrusion ( Fig . 3 E and F ) . These Prox1 high nuclei were indeed associated with VE - cadherin and F - actin signals ( Fig . 3 E , G , and H ) . In the cross - sections at VFRs of Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO embryos , Prox1 high nuclei were lined as a single layered ring , suggesting a defect in cell migration ( Fig . 3 E and F ) . In addition , in these sections , signals of F - actin or VE - cadherin were rarely observed in the more central regions than Prox1 high nuclei on the vessel wall , suggesting that structures such as cell extension toward lumen or cell – cell junction between valve - forming cells ( that might contribute to valve protrusion ) were not formed in VFRs of Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO embryos ( Fig . 3 E , G , and H ) . These data suggest that the protrusion process of lymphatic valves is impaired in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO lymphatic vasculature . We also examined valves in the veins and the heart in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice . In P3 iliac veins , valves marked with Prox1 high nuclei were observed in WT mice but not in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice , suggesting that PIEZO1 is also required for venous valve formation ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 A ) . In contrast , no obvious de - fects were detected in the heart valves of P6 Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 B ) . Whether the deficits in venous valve formation contribute to the pathology or lethality of Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice is not known . Expression of Transcription Factors Involved in Valve Development in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO Mice . A number of proteins , including tran - scription factors , are specifically expressed or activated at VFRs and are involved in the initiation of valve development ( 3 ) . Recent studies utilizing cultured LECs suggest that shear stress induced by lymph flow is upstream and induces these changes , implying that mechanotransduction is involved in this process ( 6 – 8 , 41 ) . Our previous in vitro data suggested that PIEZO1 is not required for flow - induced expression of FOXC2 and GATA2 in LECs ( 8 ) . Nuclear localization of another transcription factor NFATc1 at VFRs is suggested to occur via Ca 2 + signaling ( 7 ) . To assess the involvement of PIEZO1 in expression of transcrip - tional factors at VFRs , we examined the distribution of FOXC2 and NFATc1 in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mesentery . However , no obvious difference was detected in the expression pattern of FOXC2 or NFATc1 between WT and Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO lym - phatic vasculatures ; clusters of FOXC2 high or NFATc1 high nuclei were observed overlapping with Prox1 high signal in both WT and Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mesenteries ( Fig . 4 ) . Other transcription fac - tors and proteins are involved in the initiation of valve devel - opment , and it remains an open question whether PIEZO1 is involved in such pathways . However , our in vivo data suggest that up - regulated expression of FOXC2 and nuclear localization of NFATc1 at VFRs , which are currently proposed to occur through mechanotransduction , are not dependent on PIEZO1 . Piezo1 Activation Induced Cytoskeletal and Cell – Cell Adhesion Remodeling in Cultured LECs . Our in vivo data suggest that PIEZO1 is involved in the protrusion process of lymphatic valves , which was previously shown to be associated with remodeling of the cytoskeleton and Fig . 2 .

To test whether the activation of PIEZO1 can affect these components in LECs , we used Yoda1 , a chemical agonist of PIEZO1 , but not of PIEZO2 ( 42 , 43 ) . Before Yoda1 administration , actin fibers associated with phospho - myosin light chain 2 ( pMLC2 ) were abundantly observed in cultured LECs , while VE - cadherin + cell – cell adhesion appeared punctate . To activate PIEZO1 , we used Yoda1 at 1 . 5 μ M . This represents a moderate stimulus as the EC 50 of Yoda1 activation of PIEZO1 is ∼ 25 μ M . Treatments with higher concentrations , such as 5 μ M , resulted in detachment of LECs ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 A and B ) . When LECs were exposed to 1 . 5 μ M Yoda1 for 1 h , drastic changes were observed in the LEC morphology described above ( Fig . 5 A ) . The abundant F - actin stress fibers reorganized into predominantly cortical actin structures . pMLC2 signal was greatly reduced , and VE - cadherin + cell – cell boundaries were straightened . Continued exposure to Yoda1 ( 16 h ) led to further changes in cell morphology . LECs now became elongated with F - actin stress fibers and pMLC2 signals , while VE - cadherin + cell – cell adhesion was poorly formed . These LECs often overlapped each other . These effects of Yoda1 were suppressed by knockdown of PIEZO1 in - duced by siRNA treatment , confirming that these changes in F - actin , pMLC2 , and VE - cadherin are dependent on PIEZO1 acti - vation ( Fig . 5 B and C and SI Appendix , Fig . S4 C ) . These data suggest that activation of PIEZO1 in LECs can induce remodeling of actomyosin and / or VE - cadherin + cell – cell adhesion . Discussion Lymphatic valves are an essential structure for proper flow of the lymph throughout the body . In this study , by utilizing mouse lines lacking PIEZO1 in endothelial cells , we show that PIEZO1 is Fig . 3 . Impaired lymphatic valve protrusion in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice .

These knockout mice also exhibited pleural effusion , possibly leading to collapsed alveoli , and difficulty in breathing , which might cause the le - thality of these mice . These phenotypes bear a strong re - semblance to what was observed in human patients with familial lymphatic dysfunctions associated with loss - of - function variants of PIEZO1 ( 9 – 11 ) . It is worth noting that in those patients , deep rerouting of lymph was observed in the lower limbs , likely resulted from attenuated drainage by superficial lymphatic vessels ( 10 ) . These data suggest that the function of PIEZO1 in the lymphatic system is likely to be conserved between human and mouse . The severity of phenotypes associated with loss - of - function PIEZO1 mutations in patients covers a wide range . Some pa - tients survive to adulthood , while others experience fetal or neonatal demise due to severe tissue edema sometimes char - acterized as fetal or neonatal hydrops ( 9 – 11 ) . As varying se - verity was reported between siblings carrying the same PIEZO1 variants , there may be genetic modifiers or environmental ef - fects , which might also explain the phenotypic difference be - tween Tie2Cre ; Piezo1 cKO mice of our colony and one previously reported ( 11 , 25 ) . Mechanotransduction plays an essential role in the devel - opment , maintenance , and function of the vasculature . Here , we show that PIEZO1 is one of the mechanosensors required for lymphatic and venous valve formation , likely playing a role during the valve protrusion process . However , our data do not exclude the possibility that phenotypes other than impaired valve formation contribute to the phenotypes observed in the mutant mice . In contrast , we find that PIEZO1 is dispensable for early events in valve development , as the up - regulation of FOXC2 and NFATc1 , key transcription factors in valve devel - opment that are up - regulated by oscillatory shear stress in cultured LECs , were not affected in Tie2Cre ; Piezo1cKO mice ( 7 , 8 ) . Our in vivo data are in line with previous findings showing that knockdown of PIEZO1 and / or PIEZO2 does not affect transcriptional up - regulation of FOXC2 , Cx37 , Integrin α 9 , or GATA2 induced by oscillatory shear stress ( 8 ) . These data suggest that there are at least two different mechano - transduction pathways involved in the formation of lymphatic valves . The identity of the other mechanosensor required for initiation of valve formation remains unknown . Our in vitro data suggest that activation of PIEZO1 can induce dynamic remodeling of actomyosin and / or VE - cadherin + cell – cell adhesion in LECs . It is important to note , however , that we do not present data showing whether mechanical forces relevant for LECs Fig . 4 .

Future experiments will address this issue . Nevertheless , as Yoda1 was administrated , VE - cadherin + cell – cell junctions changed their form from punctate into straight - ened ones . These structures may have similarities to previously reported focal adherens junction ( also called punctate or dis - continuous ) and linear adherens junction ( also called continu - ous ) ; the former is connected to radial actin bundles that pull on the cadherin – catenin complex , and the latter is supported by cortical parallel actin bundles ( 44 , 45 ) . As implied by the change in the amount of pMLC2 , contracting force on actomyosin might be attenuated by Yoda1 - induced PIEZO1 activation . The effect of PIEZO1 on cellular shape or migration has been reported in BECs and other cell types ( 15 , 25 ) . In BECs , it is sug - gested that the effect of PIEZO1 on cell alignment against flow is through calpain - induced remodeling of focal adhesion ( 25 ) . In CHO cells ectopically expressing α 4 β 1 integrin , PIEZO1 - dependent in - tracellular calcium increase is suggested to negatively regulate pro - tein kinase A , which in turn modulates proteins , including Rac1 , a modulator of F - actin dynamics ( 46 ) . While the molecular mecha - nisms through which PIEZO1 activation leads to the remodeling of cytoskeleton and / or cell – cell adhesion in LECs remain to be de - termined , regulation of these cellular components is likely the key for valve morphogenesis . Together , our data highlight the require - ment of mechanosensor channel PIEZO1 in the formation of lym - phatic valves , an essential structure for lymph circulation .
