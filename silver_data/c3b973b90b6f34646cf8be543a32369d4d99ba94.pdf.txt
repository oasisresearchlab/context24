This parasite requires iron for its metabolic functions . Lactoferrin is a mammalian glycoprotein that chelates extracellular iron on mucosal surfaces , including the surface of the large intestine , where E . histolytica initiates infection . This work examined the interaction in vitro of E . histolytica trophozoites with human hololactoferrin ( iron - saturated lactoferrin ) . A minimum concentration of 50 m M Fe from hololactoferrin supported growth of the amoeba . Amoebic binding sites for hololactoferrin were different from those for human apolactoferrin , holotransferrin and haemoglobin . One amoebic hololactoferrrin - binding polypeptide of 90 kDa was found , which was not observed after treatment of trophozoites with trypsin . Hololactoferrin - binding - protein levels increased in amoebas starved of iron , or grown in hololactoferrin . Internalization of hololactoferrin was inhibited by ﬁlipin . Endocytosed hololactoferrin colocalized with an anti - chick embryo caveolin mAb in amoebic vesicles , and lactoferrin was further detected in acidic vesicles ; amoebic caveolin of 22 kDa was detected by Western blotting using this antibody . Cysteine proteases from amoebic extracts were able to cleave hololactoferrin . Together , these data indicate that E . histolytica trophozoites bind to hololactoferrin through speciﬁc membrane lactoferrin - binding proteins . This ferric protein might be internalized via caveolae - like microdomains , then used as an iron source , and degraded . INTRODUCTION Iron is an essential nutrient for pathogens surviving in a mammalian host . Therefore , a host defence strategy against pathogens is to decrease the concentration of free iron in such a way that the extracellular environment contains a very low level of iron ( Bullen , 1981 ; Weinberg & Weinberg , 1995 ; Testa , 2002 ) . In humans , this defence strategy is accomplished through iron - withholding systems , such as transferrin ( Tf ) in serum , and lactoferrin ( Lf ) in exocrine and neutrophil secretions ( Bullen , 1981 ; Finkelstein et al . , 1983 ; Masson et al . , 1966 , 1969 ; Van Snick et al . , 1974 ) . In order to survive , pathogens have developed mechanisms for scavenging iron from host supplies , such as iron - containing and iron - binding proteins ; these mechanisms are consid - ered to be virulence factors ( Finkelstein et al . , 1983 ; Weinberg , 1999 ) . In bacteria , iron - acquisition systems have been widely studied ( Alderete et al . , 1988 ; Gray - Owen & Schryvers , 1996 ; Jarosik & Land , 2000 ) . However , the mechanisms of iron acquisition in protozoa are less well understood ( Loo & Lalonde , 1984 ; Murray et al . , 1991 ; Rodrı´guez & Jungery , 1986 ; Tachezy et al . , 1998 ) . Some of these primitive eu - karyotes acquire iron from Tf through receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Coppens et al . , 1987 ; Reyes - Lo´pez et al . , 2001 ) . A receptor on Trypanosoma brucei binds and endocytoses Tf ; inside vesicles , iron is released , apotransferrin ( apoTf ) is degraded , and the receptor is recycled ( Steverding , 2000 ) . Lf is also taken up by Try . brucei ( Coppens et al . , 1987 ) . Other parasites possess lactoferrin - binding proteins ( Lfbp ) , and use Lf - iron for growth ( Britigan et al . , 1998 ; Tachezy et al . , 1996 ; Weinberg , 1999 ) . Entamoeba histolytica is an extracellular parasitic protozoan that causes amoebiasis , a human intestinal and hepatic disease that is a signiﬁcant source of morbidity and mor - tality in developing countries . E . histolytica cysts transform into trophozoites in the terminal ileum , and reproduce and invade the colonic mucosa , resulting in ulcerative lesions and dysentery .

In further stages of the disease , amoebas can migrate to the liver and other organs ( Espinosa - Cantellano & Martı´nez - Palomo , 2000 ) . E . histolytica trophozoites depend on exogenous iron sources for growth in axenic culture , and they can use both ferric and ferrous ions ( Latour & Reeves , 1965 ; Serrano - Luna et al . , 1998a ; Smith & Meerovitch , 1982 ) . The capability of amoebas to use haemoglobin ( Hb ) as an iron source , and its cleavage by cysteine proteases , has been documented ( Serrano - Luna et al . , 1998b ) . Also , the utilization of holotransferrin ( holoTf ) as an iron source , and iron acquisition through receptor - mediated endocytosis , have been described ( Reyes - Lo´pez et al . , 2001 ) . Lf has been observed in E . histolytica tubular invaginations that did not show a typical clathrin coat ( Batista et al . , 2000 ) ; however , it is not known whether human Lf supports growth of the amoeba . The aim of this work was to determine how E . histolytica trophozoites take up and use human holoLf . We established that iron acquisition from this ferric protein can support growth of the amoeba . E . histolytica hololactoferrin - binding protein ( EhLfbp ) speciﬁcally recognized holoLf ; this ferric protein was endocytosed by ﬁlipin - sensitive vesicles , which were recognized by an anti - caveolin mAb . METHODS Cultures . Trophozoites of E . histolytica strain HM - 1 : IMSS were axenically grown in BI - S - 33 medium ( Diamond et al . , 1978 ) ( Dibico ) supplemented with 16 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated bovine serum ( BS ) ( Microlab , Mexico ) , at 37 u C . Unless otherwise speciﬁed , amoebas from 48 h cultures were chilled on ice , harvested by centrifugation at 500 g , and washed twice in PBS ( 0 ? 2 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 ? 2 M Na 2 HPO 4 , 0 ? 11 M NaCl , pH 7 ? 4 ) before experiments . Trichomonas vaginalis was cultured in TYM ( Dibico ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated horse serum ( Diamond , 1957 ) ( Gibco ) . HEp - 2 cells were cultured in humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 / 95 % air at 37 u C in Eagle’s medium modiﬁed by Dulbecco , and supplemented with 5 % ( v / v ) fetal BS ( Hyclone ) , 1 % non - essential amino acids , 5 mM L - glutamine , 100 U penicillin ml 2 1 and 100 m g streptomycin ml 2 1 . Glass materials were treated with 6 ? 0 M HCl for 24 h , and rinsed six times with double - distilled water before use . All chemicals were from Sigma . Bovine holoLf was kindly donated by Morinaga Milk ( Tokyo , Japan ) . Growth of E . histolytica in holoLf as an iron source Media and iron concentrations used are shown in Table 1 . The low - iron medium listed in Table 1 is BI - S - 33 medium without ammonium ferric citrate that was treated with 5 g ml 2 1 of the chelating resin Chelex - 100 in order to remove iron from the trace reagents in the medium . The resin was subsequently removed by ﬁltration , and the medium was sterilized . This medium is henceforth referred to as ‘low - iron’ . In order to determine whether holoLf sustains trophozoite growth , the following methods were used . Growth kinetics . Cells were kept for 2 h in BI - S - 33 lacking BS , ammonium ferric citrate ( AFC ) and cysteine in order to synchronize the culture ( Vohra et al . , 1998 ) . Amoebas ( 10 4 ) were inoculated into 1 ml BI - S - 33 or low - iron with or without holoLf incubated for 96 h , and samples were collected every 24 h to test cell viability by trypan blue exclusion , using light microscopy . Viability was also tested by double labelling : amoebas ( 10 4 ) were inoculated , as described above , in medium containing FITC - human holoLf ( 25 or 50 m M total iron ) , incubated for 48 h , centrifuged , and incubated for 10 min with 10 m g propidium iodide ml 2 1 . Amoebas were washed , and scanned by ﬂow cytometry ( FACScan ; Beckton Dickinson ) . Successive transfers . Amoebas ( 10 4 ) were inoculated into BI - S - 33 , low - iron and low - iron containing human holoLf ( 50 or 100 m M total iron ) . Amoebas were subcultured in each medium at least three times , and incubated for 48 h each time . Viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion . Speciﬁc holoLf binding to the E . histolytica cell surface The interaction of the amoebic cell surface and holoLf was investigated using the following methods . Dot blot . Amoebas suspended in PBS ( 10 6 ml 2 1 ) were ﬁxed ( 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , pH 7 ? 4 , for 1 h at 37 u C ) . Cell suspen - sions ( 10 m l ) were vacuum blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane ( Sigma ) in a blotter apparatus ( Bio - Rad ) . The membrane was blocked with PBS - T ( 5 % non - fat milk in PBS / 0 ? 05 % Tween 20 , pH 7 ? 4 , for 1 h ) at room temperature , washed , and incubated for 1 h with 3 ? 0 m g HRP - holoLf ml 2 1 [ holoLf was coupled to horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) by using the method of Avrameas & Ternynck , Table 1 .

The reaction was revealed with 3 9 , 3 - diaminobenzidine . BS and Tri . vaginalis were used as negative and positive controls , respectively . Confocal microscopy . Trophozoites ( 2 6 10 5 ) were suspended for 30 min in BI - S - 33 , or low - iron lacking BS and AFC . The trophozoites were then washed , ﬁxed , and incubated for 1 h with 100 m g ml 2 1 FITC - holoLf or FITC - apoLf [ FITC - holoLf was prepared as described for holoTf ( Reyes - Lo´pez et al . 2001 ) , and FITC - apoLf was prepared by depleting iron from FITC - holoLf , as described by Mazurier & Spik ( 1980 ) ] . Samples were mounted in Vectashield on glass slides , and examined in a Leica TCS - SP2 confocal laser - scanning micro - scope , observing 10 – 20 optical sections from each cell . Competition assays . To determine the speciﬁcity of the E . histo - lytica holoLf - binding sites , nitrocellulose membranes from the dot blot , and ﬁxed amoebas from the confocal experiments , were prein - cubated for 1 h with 1 mg ml 2 1 of other iron - containing proteins ( Tf and Hb ) , and with apoLf . Evidence of an EhLfbp was obtained by preincubating the membrane or the ﬁxed cells with 1 mg holoLf ml 2 1 for 1 h , or by treatment of ﬁxed amoebas with 24 m g trypsin ml 2 1 ( 1 h at 37 u C ) , before incubation with HRP - holoLf or FITC - holoLf , as indicated for dot blot or confocal microscopy , respectively . Detection of EhLfbp in low - iron - containing medium , with and without holoLf . An amoebic total extract was obtained as reported by Serrano - Luna et al . ( 1998b ) from 5 6 10 6 cells grown for 6 h in BI - S - 33 , low - iron , and low - iron plus holoLf ( 50 m M iron ) , or grown in BI - S - 33 , and then ﬁxed and incubated with trypsin ( see above ) . Proteins ( 30 m g per well ) were separated ( 12 % SDS - PAGE ) and stained with Coomassie blue . Protein concentration was deter - mined by the method of Bradford ( 1976 ) . For overlay assays , pro - teins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( 1 ? 5 h , 400 mA ) ( Towbin et al . , 1979 ) , which was blocked ( 5 % non - fat milk in PBS - T , 3 h ) , incubated for 12 h with 3 ? 0 m g holoLf ml 2 1 , washed , and incubated with rabbit anti - human Lf antibody ( Ab ) ( Sigma , catalogue no . L 3262 ; 1 : 100 ) . A secondary HRP - anti - rabbit IgG ( 1 : 1000 ) was added . The blotted dried membrane was then scanned and quantiﬁed by densitometry using SigmaGel software . Competition assays were performed in a similar way to the dot blots , but the membrane was incubated with HRP - holoLf for 12 h . Expression of holoLf - binding sites from E . histolytica grown in dif - ferent iron sources was measured as follows : amoebas ( 1 6 10 6 ) were incubated for 30 min in BI - S - 33 or low - iron , ﬁxed ( see above ) , washed , and incubated for 30 min with 100 m g FITC - holoLf ml 2 1 , and processed for ﬂow cytometry . In other experiments , amoebas grown in low - iron or BI - S - 33 were simultaneously exposed to FITC - holoLf and BI - S - 33 , ﬁxed , washed , and processed . Fluorescence intensity ( FI ) was measured in 10 4 cells by ﬂow cytometry , and the statistical signiﬁcance of the difference between the two conditions was evaluated with the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test ( Young , 1977 ) . The holoLf endocytic pathway in E . histolytica . To investigate whether E . histolytica is able to endocytose Lf , amoebas ( 2 6 10 5 ) were incubated in low - iron ( without BS ) containing FITC - apoLf or FITC - holoLf , for 5 or 30 min , ﬁxed ( see above ) , and processed for confocal microscopy . To determine the endocytosis pathway , amoebas ( 10 6 ) were incubated for 30 min in BI - S - 33 without BS , but containing one of the following endocytosis - inhibitors : 100 m g ﬁlipin ml 2 1 , 8 m M chlorpromazine , 2 % ( w / v ) sucrose , 200 nM wortmannin or 100 mM chloroquine . Next , cells were incubated for 30 min with the inhibitor plus 100 m g ml 2 1 FITC - holoLf , and pre - pared for scanning by ﬂow cytometry and confocal microscopy . To investigate whether caveolin or clathrin was participating in the holoLf endocytosis process , amoebas ( 2 6 10 5 ) were incubated for 30 min in BI - S - 33 without BS , and then for 15 min in the presence of 200 m g FITC - holoLf ml 2 1 , ﬁxed , permeabilized ( 0 ? 2 % Triton X - 100 , 15 min ) , and ﬁnally incubated for 1 h with anti - chick embryo ﬁbroblast caveolin - 1 mAb ( Zymed , catalogue no . 03 - 6000 , clone Z034 ; 1 : 20 ) or goat anti - bovine brain clathrin Ab ( Sigma , catalogue no . C 8034 ; 1 : 40 ) . Some amoebas were also treated with 100 m g ﬁlipin ml 2 1 for 30 min before adding the Abs . Amoebas were then incubated for 1 h with secondary Abs : rabbit TRITC - anti - mouse IgG ( for caveolin ; Zymed ; 1 : 50 ) , and rabbit RITC - anti - goat IgG ( for clathrin ; Zymed ; 1 : 50 ) . The presence of caveolae - like vesicles in E . histolytica was determined by staining the following caveolae components : lipids ( 10 m g ml 2 1 Nile red for 30 min , as described by Kimura et al . , 2004 ; and Klinkner et al . , 1997 ) and caveolin [ using anti - caveolin mAb as above , and , as a secondary Ab , goat anti - mouse IgG coupled to CY5 ( Zymed ; catalogue no . 62 - 6516 ; 1 : 100 ) ] . Filipin was used to disrupt caveolae . In other assays , the trafﬁc of endocytosed holoLf was visualized using Lucifer yellow ( LY ) , which stains acidic vesicles . Cells were incubated for 35 or 45 min in BI - S - 33 containing 1 mg LY ml 2 1 and 100 m g holoLf ml 2 1 . Amoebas were then ﬁxed , permeabilized , and incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti - human Lf ( see above ) , and then for 1 h with a secondary Ab coupled to CY5 ( Zymed ; mouse anti - rabbit IgG ; 1 : 100 ) . Samples were processed for confocal microscopy , and for ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcation by ﬂow cytometry . Immunodetection of clathrin and caveolin - like protein in E . histolytica . Lysates of HEp - 2 cells or E . histolytica trophozoites ( 30 m g protein each ) were separated by 13 % SDS - PAGE , and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for 45 min at 4 u C . The blot was blocked with PBS - T at room temperature ( see dot blot ) , and incubated for 2 h with anti - caveolin - 1 or anti - clathrin Ab ( 1 : 300 ) . HRP - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG , or rabbit anti - goat IgG ( Zymed ) ( each at 1 : 2000 ) , was used as a secondary Ab . Blots were developed by chemiluminiscence ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Substrate gel electrophoresis . To determine whether amoebic proteases cleave holoLf , the method of Heussen & Dowdle ( 1980 ) was followed . Cells were placed for 6 h in BI - S - 33 or in low - iron ( both without BS ) , then centrifuged , and total extracts were obtained from the pellet . Supernatants were precipitated with neat 2 - propanol . In order to characterize the proteolytic activity , total - extract proteins from BI - S - 33 cultures were incubated with an equal volume of protease inhibitor [ p - hydroxymercuribenzoate ( pHMB ) , N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) , PMSF or EGTA ] , as reported by Serrano - Luna et al . ( 1998b ) . Samples ( 10 m g protein per well ) were run in 12 % polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with 0 ? 1 % holoLf ( 3 h , 100 V , 4 u C ) . Gels were washed , and incubated for 1 h with 2 ? 5 % Triton X - 100 , rinsed , and incubated for 12 h with 10 mM CaCl 2 in either 1 M Tris - OH , pH 7 ? 0 , or 0 ? 1 M sodium acetate - Tris / HCl , pH 4 ? 0 . Gels were rinsed one more time , and stained with Coomassie R - 250 . RESULTS Human holoLf is used as an iron source by E . histolytica trophozoites To test whether holoLf supports the growth of E . histolytica , we used several holoLf concentrations ( Table 1 ) in growth kinetics ( Fig . 1a ) . Human holoLf ( 25 – 100 m M Fe ) sup - ported growth of the amoeba over a period of 96 h . Bovine holoLf was also used by E . histolytica , though less efﬁciently than human holoLf . In low - iron ( 6 ? 5 m M Fe ) , the culture developed slowly until 48 h , and then the number of viable cells decreased . HoloLf sustained amoebic subcultures http : / / mic . sgmjournals . org 3861 HoloLf use by E . histolytica Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 21 Dec 2018 17 : 23 : 35 ( Fig . 1b ) , and the percentages of viable cells throughout three consecutive culture passages in low - iron plus 100 m M Lf - iron were 100 , 98 ? 5 and 93 ? 2 % , respectively . When 50 m M Lf - iron was tested , the number of viable cells showed a slight reduction . In low - iron , trophozoite viability decreased considerably in the ﬁrst passage , and decreased even more in the second passage . Next , we veriﬁed that human holoLf interacted with amoebas , and that cells remained viable ( Table 2 ) . In 25 m M Lf - iron , 83 % of amoebas were viable , and 65 % of these cells showed interaction with FITC - holoLf . In 50 m M Lf - iron , amoebas showed 98 % viability , and the percentage of labelled cells increased to 88 % . These data indicate that E . histolytica trophozoites use holoLf as an iron source by a mechanism in which the interaction between the parasite and holoLf is necessary . E . histolytica cells bind holoLf speciﬁcally A dot blot assay was used to demonstrate the interaction between holoLf and the trophozoite ( Fig . 2a ) . HRP - holoLf was found to be strongly associated with cells ( Fig . 2a , row 3 , I ) . Speciﬁc binding to holoLf was determined in ﬁxed cells incubated with an excess ( tenfold ) of unlabelled Hb , holoTf or apoLf , and then incubated with HRP - holoLf . Binding of HRP - holoLf was not inhibited by these proteins , and only unlabelled holoLf was able to compete ( Fig . 2a , row 3 , V ) . Since Tri . vaginalis trophozoites possess Lfbp ( Peterson & Alderete , 1984 ) , they were used as a positive control ( Fig . 2a , row 2 , I ) . BS was the negative control ( Fig . 2a , row 1 , I ) . To further analyse the binding of holoLf to the amoeba surface , confocal microscopy was carried out on ﬁxed cells . FITC - holoLf showed a patch - like pattern on the cell surface ( Fig . 2b , 2 ) . Preincubation of amoebas with unlabelled holoLf prevented the binding of FITC - holoLf ( Fig . 2b , 3 ) . Neither holoTf nor Hb competed with FITC - holoLf for the surface of the amoeba ( Fig . 2b , 4 and 5 , respectively ) , suggesting that E . histolytica cells exhibit Lf binding sites distinct from those for Hb and Tf . On the other hand , treatment of amoebas with 24 m g trypsin ml 2 1 affected their sites for FITC - holoLf binding ( Fig . 2b , 6 ) , but cell integrity was preserved ( not shown ) . To assess whether apoLf and holoLf bind to different amoeba proteins , competitive binding assays were carried out . Incubation of ﬁxed iron - starved amoebas with apoLf prior to the interaction with FITC - holoLf ( Fig . 2c , 2 ) , or with holoLf prior to the interaction with FITC - apoLf ( Fig . 2c , 3 ) , did not affect Fig . 1 .

These results indicate that the E . histolytica trophozoite possesses speciﬁc proteins that bind holoLf , and that these proteins are localized on the cell surface . Detection of EhLfbp In conditions of insufﬁcient iron availability , bacteria and protozoa express a high number of Lfbp ( Lehker & Alderete , 1992 ; Gray - Owen & Schryvers , 1996 ) . We decided to study the expression of Lfbp in amoebas grown in three different media : BI - S - 33 ( Fig . 3 , lane 1 ) , low - iron ( Fig . 3 , lane 2 ) , and low - iron plus holoLf ( Fig . 3 , lane 3 ) . Coomassie blue staining showed similar protein proﬁles in the three media . Overlay assays using holoLf and anti - Lf Ab were carried out to identify the EhLfbp . Results revealed a major band of 90 kDa , and a weak band of 45 kDa . The 90 kDa band was strongly recognized in iron - restricted amoebas ( Fig . 3 , lane 5 ) , and in the presence of holoLf ( Fig . 3 , lane 6 ) , compared with amoebas grown in BI - S - 33 ( Fig . 3 , lane 4 ) . This band was submitted to a densitometry analysis , and it showed a double intensity when amoebas were in low - iron or with holoLf . The lower band ( 80 kDa ) observed in lane 6 corresponded to the holoLf added to the medium . The speciﬁcity of the 90 kDa polypeptide was demonstrated , given that unlabelled Hb , holoTf and apoLf did not prevent the binding of HRP - holoLf ( Fig . 3 , lanes 8 – 10 , respectively ) . Only holoLf prevented the binding of HRP - holoLf to the 90 kDa band ( Fig . 3 , lane 7 ) . Treatment of amoebas with trypsin inhibited the recognition of HRP - holoLf by the 90 kDa band ( Fig . 3 , lane 11 ) . These results suggest that the 90 kDa polypeptide might correspond to a speciﬁc EhLfbp . In addition , the FITC - holoLf binding level was increased in iron - restricted amoebas ( Table 3 ) compared with the basal binding measured in amoebas grown in BI - S - 33 . However , when iron - starved amoebas were exposed simultaneously to FITC - holoLf and BI - S - 33 , the FI decreased to a value similar to that in non - starved cells . These results suggest that there is an increase in amoebic holoLf - binding sites when this protein is the sole iron source , and cells are starved of iron . However , when iron - starved amoebas were exposed to holoLf plus ferric citrate , they returned to the basal levels of expression for holoLf - binding sites ( Table 3 ) . Fig . 2 .

However , it is not known if apoLf is internalized by the parasite . Confocal microscopy was used to observe the internalization of holoLf and aopoLf . Amoebas incubated for 5 min with FITC - holoLf showed a clearly labelled surface ( Fig . 4 , 2 ) , and at 30 min , the protein was localized in vesicle - like structures ( Fig . 4 , 3 ) . However , cells incubated for 5 min with FITC - apoLf showed the protein on the surface ( Fig . 4 , 4 ) , but at 30 min few cells remained attached to the slide , and no label was found ( Fig . 4 , 5 ) . These results show that holoLf is bound and internalized by amoebas , whereas apoLf is bound , but not internalized . Also , amoebas incubated for 30 min with FITC - apoLf plus BI - S - 33 showed the label internally ( Fig . 4 , 6 ) , suggesting that apoLf immediately sequesters iron from ferric citrate , and then internalizes it as holoLf . On the other hand , we used speciﬁc inhibitors to characterize the endo - cytic holoLf pathway in E . histolytica ( Fig . 5a ) . If endocytosis by untreated amoebas is taken as 100 % , ﬁlipin ( which disrupts caveolae structure and function ) inhibited FITC - holoLf entrance by 70 % . Inhibitors of clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Wu et al . , 2003 ) , such as sucrose , chloroquine , and the cationic amphiphilic drug chlorpromazine ( not shown ) , did not affect the internalization of FITC - holoLf ( < 10 % inhibition ) . Wortmannin , which inhibits ﬂuid - phase endocytosis ( Clague et al . , 1995 ) , did not have an effect either . Similar results were obtained using these drugs in confocal microscopy assays ( not shown ) . Further , entry of FITC - holoLf was inhibited by prior incubation of E . histo - lytica trophozoites with the anti - caveolin mAb , whereas anti - clathrin Ab did not impede holoLf entry ( data not shown ) . As holoLf entry into amoebas was ﬁlipin - sensitive , Fig . 3 . Speciﬁc EhLfbp . Amoebas ( 5 6 10 6 ) were grown for 6 h in : BI - S - 33 ( lanes 1 and 4 ) , low - iron ( lanes 2 and 5 ) , and low - iron plus holoLf ( lanes 3 and 6 ) .

Lipids ( stained with Nile red ; Fig . 5b , 2 , red ) and caveolin ( immunolocalized using mAb ; Fig . 5b , 3 , blue ) , co - localized in amoebas ( Fig . 5b , 4 , violet ) . Filipin was used to corroborate the sensitivity of caveolae - like structures in amoebas . This drug disrupted lipids ( Fig . 5b , 6 ) , and diminished the recognition by anti - caveolin mAb ( Fig . 5b , 7 ) , as well as the co - localization between lipids and caveolin ( Fig . 5b , 8 ) ; the FI was measured by ﬂow cytometry , and is shown in the ﬁgure panels . Next , the participation of amoebic caveolae - like structures in the holoLf endocytosis was determined , since , at 15 min of incubation , FITC - holoLf ( green ) co - localized with caveolin - like coated vesicles ( detected with anti - caveolin mAb and a secondary Ab in red ) as a yellow ﬂuorescent mark ( Fig . 5c , 1 ) . It seems that clathrin - coated vesicles do not participate in holoLf endocytosis , since the anti - clathrin Ab did not co - localize with holoLf ( Fig . 5c , 2 ) . In order to conﬁrm the presence of caveolin - like proteins and clathrin in E . histo - lytica , Western blot assays were performed . Anti - caveolin mAb recognized amoebic proteins of 22 and 24 kDa , which might correspond to caveolin - 1 like isoforms ( Fig . 5d ) . Anti - clathrin Ab recognized a 180 kDa protein that is possibly the heavy chain of clathrin ( Fig . 5d ) ; this Ab has been used to localize amoebic clathrin ( Tovar et al . , 2000 ) . Our attempt to identify the amoebic caveolin gene was not successful . Taken together , these results show that the mechanism responsible for internalizing holoLf in E . histolytica tro - phozoites is not clathrin dependent ; however , caveolin - like containing vesicles might be involved in this process . Trafﬁc of holoLf in acidic vesicles , and proteases that cleave holoLf Since the E . histolytica trophozoite is a multivesicular cell in which non - acidiﬁed and acidiﬁed vesicles have been found ( Aley et al . , 1984 ; Swanson , 1989 ; Batista et al . , 2000 ) , we investigated whether holoLf reaches acidic vesicles , an environment in which Lf - iron is probably released . LY ( green and red ) ( Fig . 6a , 1 and 2 ) and holoLf ( blue ) ( Fig . 6a , 3 ) co - localized in low amounts in acidic vesicles ( purple and light blue ) after 35 min incubation ( Fig . 6a , 4 ) ; at 45 min , co - localization was clearly observed ( Fig . 6a , 8 , light blue ) . This co - localization was quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry ( not shown ) . These results suggest that holoLf may follow the vesicular trafﬁc from endosomes , and reach the acidic vesicles in amoebas .

Proteases of 250 , 100 , 40 and 22 kDa from amoebic extracts cleaved holoLf at pH 7 ( Fig . 6b , lane 2 ) ; however , the activity increased considerably at pH 4 ( Fig . 6b , lane 9 ) . Fig . 5 .

No activity was found in supernatants ( not shown ) . All activities were inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors pHMB and NEM ( Fig . 6b , lanes 4 and 10 , and 5 and 11 , respectively ) . There was no inhibition by the serine ( PMSF ) and metallo - ( EGTA ) protease inhibitors ( Fig . 6b , lanes 6 and 7 ) . The data suggest that cysteine proteases could cleave holoLf in acidic vesicles , where the pH allows the release of Lf - iron , which is then utilized by E . histolytica for growth .

On mucosal surfaces , iron is mainly sequestered by Lf , and its concentration has been used as a parameter to identify intestinal inﬂammatory disorders , such as ulcerative colitis ( Kane et al . , 2003 ; Masson et al . , 1966 ; Uchida et al . , 1994 ) . This study was undertaken to investigate whether E . histolytica is able to use Lf as a source of iron for growth . A possible mechanism of the Lf - iron acquisition by the parasite was also assessed . The iron content of BI - S - 33 medium supplemented with BS ranged between 90 and 105 m M depending on the reagent batch ; however , the minimum iron requirement for amoebas is > 50 m M . This requirement surpasses that of the majority of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells , and is due to the presence of amoebic iron - containing proteins ( Weinbach et al . , 1980 ) . Human Lf - iron ( > 25 m M ) sup - ported E . histolytica growth , and 50 – 100 m M Lf - iron sustained growth through several passages . Lf - iron was the growth support , since a low - iron environment and absence of this ferric protein promote amoebic death . Thus , Lf - iron seems to be more efﬁcient than ferric citrate for amoebic growth . In addition , pathogens grown in vitro require higher iron concentrations from ferric citrate , ferric nitrilotriace - tate ( Fe - NTA ) , FeSO 4 and other sources than from host proteins , such as Hb , Lf and Tf ( Wilson et al . , 1994 ; Tachezy et al . , 1996 ; Jarosik et al . , 1998 ; Serrano - Luna et al . , 1998b ; Reyes - Lo´pez et al . , 2001 ) . The results also show that amoebas have a constitutive level of expression of binding sites for holoLf . However , in conditions of iron deﬁciency , the number of binding sites for holoLf is increased . Interest - ingly , in the presence of holoLf plus ferric citrate , amoebas expressed the basal level of binding sites , which could be due to Lf - iron acquisition requiring receptor expression and synthesis , endocytosis and iron release at acidic pH , whereas iron ferric citrate acquisition may consist of a more straightforward iron release and entry process . Suchan et al . ( 2003 ) reported that human Lf - iron ( up to 100 m M ) was unable to support E . histolytica HM - 1 : IMSS growth in TYI - S - 33 containing the iron chelator 2 , 2 - dipyridyl ( 100 m M ) . A possible explanation could be the characteristics of Lf in its N - terminal arginine - rich part , which is important for binding to some receptors ( van Veen et al . , 2002 ) . We used the Chelex - 100 resin to eliminate ferrous and ferric iron from traces of reagents in the media , since the resin can be subsequently removed from media , and then the culture is not affected . Chelex - 100 also se - questers calcium , magnesium and zinc ( Giles & Czuprynski , 2004 ) , but they are restored by the serum added after chelation . Our data also show that bovine holoLf can sustain amoebic growth , but to a lower extent than human holoLf . It has been reported that Lf glycans are speciﬁc for different animal species ( Spik et al . , 1988 ) , however , since we tested human and bovine Lf only , it remains to be determined whether or not the use of Lf - iron by E . histolytica is species speciﬁc . It is important to state that the holoLf concentra - tions used by amoebas in this work can be found in phy - siological conditions . HoloLf present in the large intestine could be providing iron to amoebic cells , which is important for amoebic colonization and invasion . We found speciﬁc holoLf - binding sites distributed in a patch - like pattern on the amoebic surface , which is in agreement with the observations of Batista et al . ( 2000 ) by electron microscopy . Other iron - containing proteins , such as Tf and Hb , and apoLf , were unable to prevent holoLf recognition by the E . histolytica sites located on the cell surface . HoloLf recognition was affected by unlabelled holoLf only , or by degradation of amoebic membrane pro - teins with trypsin , a serine protease . Therefore , different receptors for all these proteins may be present in E . histo - lytica . Protozoa such as Tritrichomonas foetus , Leishmania donovani and Tri . vaginalis bind ferric Lf in a speciﬁc receptor - mediated fashion to use it as iron source ( Peterson & Alderete , 1984 ; Lehker & Alderete , 1992 ; Tachezy et al . , 1996 ) . However , Leishmania chagasi binds Tf and Lf through the same protein , indicating that a speciﬁc receptor is not present ( Wilson et al . , 2002 ) . All these results corroborate that E . histolytica possesses speciﬁc holoLf - binding proteins on the surface . E . histolytica Lfbp might be recognizing amino acid residues or structural motifs unique to the holoLf molecule . In mammalian cells , Lf receptors bind equally to apoLf and holoLf ( Testa , 2002 ) . As a result of its conformation , ApoLf ( iron - free Lf ) displays different pro - perties compared with the ferric - saturated form of Lf ( Mazurier & Spik , 1980 ; Testa , 2002 ) . Since human apoLf did not compete with holoLf for the binding sites in amoe - bas , this suggests that amoebas could have different receptors for the two Lfs . In addition , apoLf was able to bind to amoebas , but the cells became round and died ; we presume that apoLf had an amoebicidal effect that damaged the cellular membrane , and we are currently studying this possibility . Amoebic proteins of 70 and 140 kDa that bind Tf have been reported ( Reyes - Lo´pez et al . , 2001 ) . Here , we report an E . histolytica surface protein of 90 kDa that is speciﬁcally recognized by holoLf . This recognition was not affected by Tf , Hb or apoLf ; it was only inhibited with an excess of holoLf , or by treatment of amoebas with trypsin . On the other hand , since the 90 kDa band was detected in amoebas grown with ferric citrate , in low - iron , and with holoLf , this protein could be constitutively synthesized ; however , its expression could be stimulated by holoLf or iron stress . Whether the EhLfbp is involved in the virulence of the parasite remains to be determined . With these results , it is tempting to speculate that amoebas could bind and use several iron - containing proteins at the time of invasion , e . g . Lf from mucosal surfaces , Tf from serum , and Hb from destroyed erythrocytes . Use of multiple iron sources by E . histolytica explains its successful survival in different organs , and it should be highly advantageous at sites with different iron environments . The ability of amoebas to bind and endocytose holoLf , and the presence of a speciﬁc E . histolytica 90 kDa protein on the cell surface , provide some indication of the mechanism of 3868 Microbiology 151 N . Leo´n - Sicairos and others Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 21 Dec 2018 17 : 23 : 35 Lf - iron acquisition . Protein endocytosis may occur through several different pathways , such as clathrin - coated pits , caveolar structures , and macropinocytosis ( Mellman , 1996 ; Pelkmans & Helenius , 2002 ) . By using speciﬁc inhibitors of vesicular trafﬁc and endocytosis , we found that only ﬁlipin inhibited the holoLf entry in amoebas . Filipin disrupts cholesterol , a major component of membrane glycolipid microdomains , and thus affects the structure and organiza - tion of caveolar components ( Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ; Orlandi & Fishman , 1998 ) . Filipin has been recently used in E . histo - lytica to detect the presence of raft - like vesicles , and investi - gate their participation in virulence events ( Laughlin et al . , 2004 ) . We localized caveolae - like structures in E . histolytica by using an anti - caveolin mAb and lipid staining ( Fig . 5b ) ; this mAb recognizes both a and b isoforms of caveolin - 1 in ﬁbroblasts from humans , mice and rats ( Okamoto et al . , 1998 ) , and , in amoebas , it recognized two proteins of 22 and 24 kDa that could correspond to caveolin - 1 - like isoforms . Further evidence of caveolae - like structures in E . histolytica included the inhibition of co - localization between lipids and caveolin when amoebas were treated with ﬁlipin . This inhibition could be due to loss of integrity of caveolae - like structures , as a result of cholesterol disruption and caveolin dissolution . The participation of E . histolytica caveolae - like vesicles in holoLf internalization was further supported by endocytosis experiments , which showed co - localization of holoLf and the anti - caveolin signal in vesicles after 15 min of holoLf endocytosis . Clathrin - coated pits did not participate in the holoLf endocytosis . After endocytosis of holoLf via amoebic caveolae - like struc - tures , we found that this protein reached acidic vesicles . In the environment of these vesicles , holoLf probably releases iron . The vesicular trafﬁc of caveolae has been the subject of some controversy ; however , recent studies have shown that caveolar structures can interact with both the caveosome and the lysosome pathway , and that caveolin - enriched regions can incorporate cargo in a regulated manner ( Escriche et al . , 2003 ; Peters et al . , 2003 ; Parton , 2004 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1995 ) . Furthermore , in amoebic extracts , we found proteases that cleave holoLf . It has been reported that E . histolytica endo - cytic vesicles are enriched in cysteine proteases which con - tain acid phosphatase ( Temesvari et al . , 1999 ) ; the presence of holoLf in acid - phosphatase - containing vacuoles has been described in Trt . foetus and E . histolytica ( Affonso et al . , 1994 ; Batista et al . , 2000 ) . E . histolytica acidic vesicles show a pH below 4 , ( Aley et al . , 1984 ) , a pH at which Lf - iron is partially released . These results suggest that holoLf could be releasing iron in the amoeba cysteine - protease - enriched acidic vesicles . Together , the results indicate that human holoLf can be used by the parasite as an iron source for growth . The amoeba might acquire Lf - iron in a speciﬁc receptor - mediated endocytosis mechanism via caveolae - like ﬁlipin - sensitive vesicles . The acidic environment of amoebic vesicles , and the presence of cysteine proteases , may be factors that con - tribute to Lf - iron release . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank QFB Blanca Reyes and Biol .
