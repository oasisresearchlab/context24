Cofilin , a 21kDa actin - binding protein , binds to F - actin in a 1 : 1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin molecule ( Nishida , E . , S . Maekawa , and H . Sakai , Biochemistry , 23 , 5307 - 5313 , 1984 ) and is capable of controlling actin polymerization and depolymerization in vitro in a pH - sensitive manner ( Yonezawa , N . , E . Nishida , and H . Sakai , J . Biol . Chem . , 260 , 14410 - 14412 , 1985 ) . In this study , immunoblot analysis using monospecific antibodies against cofilin showed that cofilin is ubiquitously distributed in a variety of bovine and rat organs and tissues . Cofilin is also present in various cultured cell lines . Indirect immunofluorescence staining of mouse fibroblastic cells and human epidermoid carcinoma cells indicated that cofilin is distributed nearly uniformly in the cytoplasm and is concentrated in ruffling membranes where F - actin is also concentrated as revealed by staining with rhodamine - phalloin . Stress fiber structures were not strongly stained with the anti - cofilin antibody , although stress fiber staining was sometimes observed near the cell periphery in mouse 3T3 cells . These results suggest that the bulk of cofilin may not be associated with F - actin bundles in vivo . Cofilin ( 12 ) is a 21kDa actin - binding protein which has been purified from mammalian brain ( 7 ) and kidney ( 10 ) . Previous in vitro studies have revealed that at near neutral pH , cofilin binds to F - actin in a 1 : 1 molar ratio of cofilin to actin molecule ( 12 ) . The binding of cofilin to F - actin inhibited actin - myosin interactions and blocked the binding of tropomyosin to F - actin ( 12 ) . Cofilin also binds to mono - meric actin in a 1 : 1 molar ratio with a dissociation constant of 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 ƒÊM at pH 7 . 1 ( 11 ) . Recently , it has been demonstrated in vitro that cofilin is capable of controlling actin polymerization and depolymerization in a pH - sensitive manner ( 16 ) . We show in this report that cofilin exists in a wide variety of cells and tissues derived from chicken , rat , mouse , pig , bovine , and human , and that cofilin is nearly uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of cultured cells except in ruffling membranes . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials . Fetal calf serum ( FCS ) , RPMI 1640 , modified Eagle ' s medium ( MEM ) and Dulbecco ' s medium ( DMEM ) were obtained from GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ; calf serum ( CS ) from Flow Laboratories , McLean , VA ; N - 2 - hydroxymethylpiperazine - N7 - 2 - ethane - 443 444 N . Yonezawa et al . sulfonate ( HEPES ) from Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ; fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - conjugated IgG fraction from goat antiserum directed against rabbit IgG from Cappel Laboratories , Cochranville , PA ; and penicillin G and kanamycin from Meiji Seika , Co . , Tokyo . RPMI 1640 and MEM were usually supplemented with 10 mM HEPES , 0 . 2 sodium bicarbonate , 100 U / ml penicillin G and 0 . 2 mg / ml kanamycin . DMEM was supple - mented with 0 . 15 % sodium bicarbonate and the same antibiotics at the same concen - trations as above . Rhodamine isothiocyanate ( RITC ) - conjugated phalloin ( 15 ) was a gift from Dr . Th . Wieland , Max Planck Institut , Heidelberg , FRG . Preparation of antibodies against cofilin . Cofilin was purified from porcine brains as described previously ( 11 , 12 ) . The purified protein was further subjected to preparative SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and the protein bands were excised and processed for immunization . Antibodies were elicited in rabbits . A monospecific antibody against cofilin was obtained by affinity chromatography using cofilin - Sepharose . Purified cofilin ( 0 . 8 mg ) was covalently coupled to one ml of CNBr - activated Sepharose 4B ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals ) . Immune serum was mixed with 2 vol of phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and brought to 50 % saturation with ammonium sulfate . The precipitate was collected by centrifugation , suspended in and dialyzed against PBS , and then poured into a small cofilin - Sepharose column . Unbound material was washed out with PBS , and bound antibody was eluted with 0 . 1 M glycine / HCl ( pH 2 . 7 ) . The antibodies obtained were neutralized with 2 M Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 4 ) and dialyzed against PBS . Bovine serum albumin was added to the purified antibody solution to give a final concentration of 0 . 5 % ( W / V ) . Cells and growth conditions . The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line KB was cultured in MEM containing 10 % CS at 37(cid:129)Ž in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 - 95 % air . The mouse fibroblast cell line C3H - 2K , Swiss 3T3 , rat embryonic fibroblast cell line 3Y1 - B , and human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FCS . Secondary cultures of chicken embryonic fibroblast ( CEF ) cells were grown in MEM containing 5 % FCS . The mouse T cell clone K23 and mouse P cell clone ( mast cell progenitor cell line ) IC2 were cultured as described previously ( 5 ) . Briefly , cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 5 % FCS , 50 ƒÊM ƒÀ - mercaptoethanol and 50 % ( v / v ) conditioned medium prepared by stimulation of mouse spleen cells with concanavalin A . Ruffling membranes were induced in KB cells by the methods described previously ( 2 , 4 ) . Cell fractionation . Mouse fibroblast - Mouse fibroblastic cells were fractionated into three fractions as described by Fey et al . ( 1 ) . Plates of C3H - 2K cells were rinsed twice with PBS , and first extracted in a buffer solution containing 100 mM NaCl , 300 mM sucrose , 10 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 3 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and 1 . 2 mM PMSF for 10 min at 0(cid:129)Ž . The extract ( first fraction ) was removed and then a second extraction buffer solution ( 250 mM ammonium sulfate , 300 mM sucrose , 10 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 3 mM MgCl2 , 1 . 2 mM PMSF , and 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ) was poured into the plates , and the plates incubated for 10 min at 0(cid:129)Ž . The resulting extract ( second fraction ) was removed . The same buffer solution was added to the remaining insoluble material and this material was scraped from the plates with a rubberpoliceman ( third fraction ) . An aliquot ( 3 ml ) of each fraction was mixed with 25 ƒÊl of 2 % deoxycholate and 1 ml of 24 % trichloroacetic acid , and centrifuged for 30 min at 3 , 300 rpm . The pellets were prepared for SDS - polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis . Rat brain—Rat brains were freshly dissected and washed in a buffer solution consisting of 50 mM Tris - Cl ( pH 7 . 3 ) , 25 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , and 250 mM sucrose . Then the brains were homogenized in 10 vol of the same buffer solution with a teflon - pestle glass homogenizer . The homogenate was centrifuged at 1 , 000 g for 10 min . To the pellet , 5 vol of the above buffer was added and homogenized again . The nuclear fraction was Distribution of Cofilin 445 obtained as a pellet after centrifugation at 1 , 000 g for 10 min . The supernatant of the first 1 , 000 g spin was centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction as a pellet . The supernatant was centrifuged at 100 , 000 g for 2 h , and a microsomal fraction and a soluble fraction were obtained as pellet and supernatant , respectively . Each fraction was mixed with 3 vol of PBS containing 1 % SDS and 1 mM PMSF , and incubated in boiling water for 5 min . After centrifugation at 18 , 000 rpm for 60 min , the supernatants were used for SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . Immunoblotting analysis . Samples were subjected to SDS - polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis ( 6 ) , and were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose sheets ( 14 ) . The sheets were first blocked for 1 h with 3 % gelatin dissolved in 20 mM Tris - Cl containing 500 mM NaCI , pH 7 . 5 ( TBS ) for 1 h . After a brief rinse in TBS , the sheets were incubated with the antibody in TBS containing 1 % gelatin for about 2 h . The sheets were then rinsed in TBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 for 50 min , and incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG . After a rinse in TBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 for 50 min , the sheets were developed in 0 . 05 % 4 chloro - 1 - naphthol and 0 . 03 % H2O2 in TBS for 10 min . Immunofluorescence staining . Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described previously ( 3 ) . Cells grown on cover slips were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min , washed in PBS , and treated with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min . They were then incubated with antibodies at the indicated dilutions for 30 min at 37(cid:129)Ž . After washing in PBS , cover slips were incubated with FITC - coniugated 2nd antibodies for 30 min at 37(cid:129)Ž . In most cases , coverslips were subsequently incubated with RITC - coniugated phalloin for 15 min . RESULTS Immunochemical identification of cofilin in tissues and cultured cells . Two rabbits immunized with porcine brain cofilin produced antibodies . The monospecificity of the anti - cofilin antibody purified by affinity chromatography on cofilin - Sepharose was confirmed by the immunoblotting analysis of porcine brain extracts . Figure 1 shows that the purified antibody reacts exclusively with a protein of the same electro - phoretic mobility as purified cofilin . It was also found that the antibody reacts with cofilin itself . These results demonstrate that cofilin ( 21kDa ) is not a degradation product of a larger protein . The immunoblotting analysis demonstrated the presence of cofilin in a variety of mammalian tissues ( Fig . 2 ) . Among the rat organs examined , brain , lung , kidney , liver , and heart contained a single crossreactive protein that comigrated with porcine brain cofilin on polyacrylamide gels . In the case of heart and liver , the corresponding band was so faintly stained that it could not be clearly visualized in photographs , as seen in Fig . 2 , although the presence of the stained band was reproducible . Bovine adrenal gland , bovine stomach ( Fig . 2 ) , and rat testis ( not shown ) also contained a 21kDa crossreactive protein . In contrast , rat skeletal muscle contained few or no crossreactive polypeptides ( Fig . 2 ) . A protein with the same electrophoretic mobility as cofilin was also identified in a variety of cultured cells ( Fig . 3 ) including mouse fibroblasts ( C3H - 2K and Swiss 3T3 ) , a mouse T cell clone ( K23 ) , a mouse P cell clone ( mast cell progenitor IC2 ) , rat embryonic fibroblasts ( 3Y1 - B ) , chicken embryonic fibroblasts ( CEF ) , human epidermoid carcinoma cells ( KB ) , and human cervical carcinoma cells ( HeLa ) . Of 446 N . Yonezawa et al . these , chicken embryonic fibroblasts reacted most weakly with the anti - cofilin anti - body . In each of these immunoblotting analyses , the anti - cofilin antibody reacted exclusively with a single 21kDa protein . No other crossreactive proteins were detected ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , these results demonstrated the widespread occurrence of cofilin in Fig . 1 . Specificity of the anti - cofilin antibody . Two sets of crude extracts of porcine brain ( A and B ) and purified cofilin ( C and D ) were electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide ( 13 % ) gels . After the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets , A and C were stained with amidoblack . and B and D were immunoreacted with affinity purified antibody ( (cid:129) ~ 10 diluted with TBS containing 1 % gelatin ) .

Subcellular distribution of cofilin . 448 N . Yonezawa et al . vertebrate organs , tissues and cultured cells . The subcellular distribution of cofilin was investigated by using a cell fractionation method combined with immunoblotting analysis . Rat brain tissue was fractionated into nuclear , mitochondrial , microsomal , and soluble fractions as described under MATERIALS AND METHODS , followed by an immunoblotting analysis . As shown in Fig . 4A , the bulk of the cofilin was recovered in the soluble fraction , while part of the cofilin was recovered in both the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions . Another fractionation method was applied to fibroblastic cells cultured in dishes . Mouse C3H - 2K cells , grown to confluence , were fractionated into three fractions ; " soluble " ( detergent - soluble ) , " cytoskeleton " ( detergent - resistant , high salt - soluble ) , and " nuclear matrix - intermediate filament " ( detergent - and high salt - insoluble ) fractions . Fig . 4B shows that cofilin was largely recovered in the " soluble " fractions , but a small portion of the cofilin was also detected in the " cytoskeleton " fraction . Intracellular distribution of cofilin . The indirect immunofluorescence staining method was used to localize cofilin in mouse fibroblastic C3H - 2K cells ( Fig . 5 ) and Fig . 5 . Immunofluorescence visualization of cofilin in mouse fibroblastic C3H - 2K cells . C3H - 2K cells were fixed , permeabilized , and incubated with antibody to cofilin ( (cid:129) ~ 10 diluted with PBS ) , FITC - conjugated 2nd antibody and RITC - conjugated phalloin as described under MATERIALS AND METHODS .

(cid:129) ~ 450 . Distribution of Cofilin 449 human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Since cofilin interacts strongly with actin in vitro ( 11 , 12 , 16 ) and in order to compare the subcellular distribution of cofilin with that of F - actin , the cells were stained not only with the anti - cofilin antibody but also with rhodamine - phalloin which specifically recognizes F - actin . In both types of cells , cofilin was distributed in the cytoplasm rather uniformly except for in the cell periphery . Cofilin did not appear strongly associated with stress fibers . There was little decrease in the anti - cofilin staining intensity in the nuclear region . This may indicate the presence of cofilin in the nucleus . The staining was hardly visible when C3H - 2K cells were reacted with FITC - conjugated 2nd antibody alone ( data not shown ) . When ruffling membranes were induced in KB cells by the addition of insulin , cofilin became concentrated there where F - actin was also con - Fig . 6 . Immunofluorescent localization of cofilin in human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells . KB cells were incubated with 10 - 7 , M insulin for 4 min at 37(cid:129)Ž in order to induce ruffling membranes . After fixation and permeabilization , cells were incubated with anti - cofilin antibody ( (cid:129) ~ 10 diluted with PBS ) , FITC - conjugated 2nd antibody and RITC - conjugated phalloin sequentially .

Yonezawa et al . centrated , as revealed by the rhodamine - phalloin staining ( Fig . 6 ) . C3H - 2K cells also showed ruffling membranes on occasion . Cofilin was localized in these ruffling membranes along with F - actin ( Fig . 5 ) . In mouse fibroblastic 3T3 cells , stress fiber - like structures were sometimes stained by anti - cofilin antibody near the cell periphery ( Fig . 7 , arrow ) . DISCUSSION Cofilin was first purified from porcine brain and its interaction with actin has been characterized in detail ( 7 , 11 , 12 , 16 ) . Later , it was also purified from porcine kidney ( 10 ) . Biochemical studies revealed that kidney cofilin does not functionally and structurally differ from brain cofilin . In this study we have shown that a protein which is immunologically crossreactive with cofilin is present in vertebrate organs and cultured cells . On the basis of the similarity in the molecular weights ( 21kDa ) of the protein and porcine brain cofilin , we conclude that cofilin is widely distributed in most mammalian tissues except for skeletal muscle . Furthermore , it is present in cultured cell lines derived from a variety of mammalian tissues and organs . Indirect immunofluorescence staining revealed that , in mouse fibroblastic C3H - 2K cells , cofilin is distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm and is also present in the nucleus . Moreover , it was found that cofilin is densely distributed in the ruffling membranes but is not strongly associated with stress fibers . The results of the cell fractionation experiments were consistent with those of the immunofluorescence staining . These results might suggest that some fraction of cofilin binds to the non - bundled F - actin in the cell periphery in living cells and that the bulk of it is associated with actin monomers or oligomers , because cofilin is capable of binding to the actin molecule strongly in vitro ( 11 , 12 , 16 ) . We suggest that in some cases cofilin is associ - ated with stress fibers , because in Swiss 3T3 cells , stress fiber - like structures near the cell periphery were stained with anti - cofilin antibody . Such faint staining of stress fibers could be obscured by the dense uniformly distributed staining of the cytoplasm seen everywhere except in the cell periphery . Fig . 7 . Immunofluorescent localization of cofilin in Swiss 3T3 cells . Swiss 3T3 cells were fixed , permeabilized , and incubated with antibody to cofilin ( (cid:129) ~ 10 diluted with PBS ) and FITC - conjugated 2nd antibody as described under MATERIALS AND METHODS . A fluorescence micrograph is shown . The arrow indicates stress fiber - like structures . (cid:129) ~ 580 . Distribution of Cofilin 451 A possible tunction of cofilin in cells may be suggested by its relatively dense distri - bution in ruffling membranes . For instance , the cofilin present in the cell periphery may spatially and temporally regulate the behavior of cellular structures containing of actin filaments so as to induce membrane ruffles in response to growth factors . It has been reported that the intracellular pH is raised by the exposure of cells to growth factors ( 8 , 9 , 13 ) . We have previously shown that cofilin regulates polymeri - zation and depolymerization of actin in vitro in a pH - dependent manner ( 16 ) . Taking these two facts together , it is possible that growth factors induce the reorganization of actin structures by raising the intracellular pH in regions where cofilin is co - distributed .
