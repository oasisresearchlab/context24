Basement membrane assembly requires integrin activity but the role of the associated actomyosin cyto - skeleton is poorly understood . Here , we identify the actin - bundling protein T - plastin ( Pls3 ) as a regulator of basement membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis . In utero depletion of Pls3 transcripts in mouse embryos caused basement membrane and polarity defects in the epidermis but had little effect on cell adhesion and differentiation . Loss - of - function experiments demonstrated that the apicobasal polarity defects were secondary to the disruption of thebasementmembrane .

Our results provide insights into the regulation of cortical actomyosin and its importance for basement membrane assembly and skin morphogenesis . INTRODUCTION The mouse epidermis is an ideal model system to study the estab - lishment of tissue architecture during development . Genetic studies have highlighted key roles for cell adhesion and polarity , the actin cy - toskeleton , and spindle orientation in this complex process ( 1 – 6 ) . The basementmembrane ( BM ) alsoplaysamajorroleinthemorphogenesis of this tissue by functioning as a molecular platform that provides mechanical , structural , and signaling support [ reviewed in ( 7 – 9 ) ] . TheBM is a thin , sheetlikeextracellular matrix ( ECM ) thatunderlies all epithelia and endothelia . Quantitatively , the major components of BMs are type IV collagen , laminin , nidogen , and perlecan . Type IV col - lagen and laminin both assemble into large , homomeric suprastructures , and nidogen and perlecan link these two networks , thus increasing their stability ( 10 , 11 ) . In the skin , the BM separates the dermis , which is a con - nective tissue , from the epidermis , which consists of stratified differen - tiating keratinocytes and functions as a barrier ( 12 , 13 ) . The molecular composition of the BM varies between different regions of the skin , for example , interfollicular versus follicular regions , which creates specific niches that influence key processes ( such as the behavior of multipotent epidermalstemcells ) ( 14 ) andmediatesinteractionsbetweenpopulations ofdifferentcells ( 15 ) . TheskinBMisadynamicstructure , withepidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts both playing critical roles in the assembly and remodeling of the BM through the secretion of its constit - uent proteins ( 16 , 17 ) and through cell - matrix interactions that transmit mechanical forces generated by cytoskeleton to the BM ( 18 , 19 ) . Integrin - mediated cell - matrix adhesions ( also known as focal adhe - sions ) play a key role in linking the cytoskeleton to the BM . Loss - of - function experiments in the mouse epidermis have demonstrated key roles for b 1 integrin ( 1 , 4 ) , its binding partner integrin - linked kinase ( ILK ) ( 2 ) , and the ILK - binding protein PINCH1 ( 20 ) in the assembly of the skin BM . Without these proteins , the BM - cytoskeleton link is severed , causing major defects in cell adhesion and polarity and in BM organization . It is equally important to study the direct role played by the actin cytoskeleton and its binding proteins in skin BM assembly . Plastins ( also known as fimbrins ) are highly conserved actin - bundling proteins ( 21 ) . The single plastin of budding yeast , Sac6p , plays a key role in morphogenesis , endocytosis , and polarity ( 22 , 23 ) . Mam - mals have three plastins : I - plastin ( encoded by Pls1 ) , present in the in - testine and in the kidney ; L - plastin ( encoded by Lcp1 ) , present in hematopoietic cells ; and T - plastin ( encoded by Pls3 ) , which is detected in solid tissues , including the skin epidermis ( 24 , 25 ) . Loss - of - function studies in mice have shown that L - plastin is essential for the development and function of T cells ( 26 ) , whereas I - plastin plays a role in the function of intestinal microvilli ( 27 ) and stereocilia ( 28 ) . In humans , mutations in PLS3 cause early - onset osteoporosis ( 29 ) , whereas high expression of PLS3 correlateswithprotectionagainstspinalmuscularatrophy , afrequent genetic cause of early childhood lethality ( 30 ) . Moreover , ectopic or dysre - gulatedexpressionof PLS3 isahallmarkofseveralcancers , includingSézary syndrome , an aggressive form of cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( 31 ) . Here , we investigated the role of Pls3 in the developing mouse epider - mis . Silencing of Pls3 expression disrupted the epidermal architecture and induced defects in BM organization and in the polarity and spindle orientation of epidermal cells . We found that the depletion of the po - larity protein Par3 did not affect BM organization , yet subtle develop - mental defects in the actin cytoskeleton were incompatible with the assembly of a normal BM . Pls3 localized to the actomyosin - rich cortical cytoskeleton of epidermal keratinocytes . Although depletion of Pls3 in theepidermisdidnotpreventcell - cellorcell - BMadhesionor b 1 integrin activity , actomyosinorganizationandmyosinIIactivationwereperturbed . Moreover , weshowthatinhibitionofmyosinIImotoractivityseverelydis - rupted BM organization . These observations provide insights into the functionofPls3 , theorganizationofthecorticalcytoskeletoninvivo , andtheir role in BM assembly and tissue morphogenesis in a mammalian system . RESULTS Pls3 depletion disrupts epidermal architecture In the mouse , commitment of the epidermal lineage begins soon after gastrulation , and stratification of proliferating and differentiating kera - tinocytes is evident by embryonic day 16 . 5 ( E16 . 5 ) ( 32 ) . To study the function of Pls3 , we selected three potent Pls3 - specific short hairpin RNAs ( shRNAs ) — Pls3 - 2958 , Pls3 - 353 , and Pls3 - 1215 — and confirmed that each effectivelydepleted Pls3 expression in cultured primarymouse keratinocytes ( Fig . 1A and fig . S5 ) . To study the function of Pls3 in ep - idermal development in vivo , we injected the embryonic sacs of E9 . 5 Department of Cell and Developmental Biology , Sackler Faculty of Medicine , Tel Aviv University , Tel Aviv 69978 , Israel . * Corresponding author .

S8 ) . To examine the effects of Pls3 silencing on epidermal differentiation and architecture , we isolated dorsal skin sections from control or Pls3 knockdown ( KD ) E16 . 5 embryos and immunostained the tissue with antibodies recognizing markers of the basal , suprabasal , and granular epidermal layers [ keratin 14 ( K14 ) , K10 , and filaggrin , respectively ] . Ep - idermis from Pls3 KD embryos exhibited abnormal tissue architecture and was curved and irregularly shaped compared with the relatively flat appearance of the control epidermis ( Fig . 1 , B to G ) . Epidermis from control embryos showed uniform labeling of K14 in the basal layer and the developing hair follicles , K10 present in all suprabasal cells , and filaggrin in the most apical granular layer ( Fig . 1 , B to D ) . In con - trast , epidermis from Pls3 KD embryos showed aggregations of K14 - positive cells extending up to about six to eight cells in depth ( Fig . 1E ) . Similarly , K10 staining was not uniform , with some regions showing staining in all suprabasal cells and other regions showing areas of about five to six cell layers with no staining ( Fig . 1F ) . Filaggrin was detected in the most apical layers of the epidermis from Pls3 KD embryos ( Fig . 1G ) , as observed in the epidermis from control embryos . All of the defects observed with Pls3 - 2958 were recapitulated in embryos transduced with lentivirus carrying Pls3 - 353 on E9 . 5 and examined on E16 . 5 ( fig . S1A ) . Notably , K6 ( a stress - related marker of hyperproliferation ) and acti - vated caspase 3 ( a marker of apoptotic cells ) were not present in the epidermis from Pls3 KD embryos ( fig . S2 ) . These data indicate that al - though Pls3 depletion leads to defects in epidermal architecture , it does not interfere with differentiation . The distribution of cell - cell adhesion proteins is largely maintained in Pls3 - depleted epidermis Epidermalarchitectureisestablishedthroughahighlyorderedsequenceofevents , and defects in any of several processes , including cell adhe - sion , cell polarity , spindle orientation , and BM assembly , can lead to abnormalities . We therefore asked whether Pls3 depletion affected these processes . We first examined distribution of E - cadherin and a - catenin in the epidermis of control and Pls3 KD embryos ( Fig . 2 , A to D ) . These adhesion proteins are important for the formation of adherens junc - tions , which play a key role in tissue morphogenesis ( 33 , 34 ) . In the ep - idermis from control embryos , the two proteins were enriched at the periphery of cells but were largely excluded from the base of basal layer cells ( Fig . 2 , A and C ) . A similar pattern was seen in the epidermis from Pls3 KD embryos , except that labeling was also detected at the base of basallayercells ( Fig . 2 , BandD ) . Moreover , thedistributionofE - cadherin and a - catenin revealed a striking difference in tissue structure : Cells from controlembryosexhibitedanorderedarchitecture , transitioningfromcu - boidal cells in the basal layer to a more flattened shape in the suprabasal layers , whereas epidermal cells from Pls3 KD embryos were irregularly shaped in both the basal and suprabasal layers , and the shape transition was less pronounced . Desmosomes and tight junctions are also important for epidermal structureandfunction ( 35 ) . Weexamined the distributionofdesmopla - kin and zonula occludens - 1 ( ZO1 ) , markers of desmosomes and tight junctions , respectively . In the epidermis from both control and Pls3 KD embryos , desmoplakin maintained its peripheral enrichment and ZO1 was detected at the apical part of the tissue ( fig . S3 ) . These data suggest that PLS3 is required for normal cell shape and tissue structure ; how - ever , cell - cell junctions form in Pls3 - depleted epidermis . Pls3 - depleted epidermis exhibits defects in Par3 distribution and spindle orientation Apicobasal polarity contributes greatly to epithelial morphogenesis [ reviewed in ( 36 , 37 ) ] . To determine whether loss of Pls3 disrupted cell polarity , we stained sections of skin from control and Pls3 KD embryos for the polarity protein Par3 and the centrosome marker pericen - trin ( Fig . 2 , E to H ) . As expected , the basal layer of the epidermis from control embryos showed apical enrichment of Par3 ( Fig . 2E ) ; however , Par3 was often mislocalized in the epidermis of Pls3 KD embryos ( Fig . 2F ) . Overall , the ratio of ap - icaltobasalPar3stainingintensityinbasallayercellswassignificantlydecreased ( 24 % ) by Pls3 loss ( Fig . 2I ) . In contrast , pericentrin maintained its apical localiza - tion in the epidermis of Pls3 KD embryos ( Fig . 2 , G and H ) . Intheepidermis , Par3 - derived polarity cues guide spindle orientation ( 38 ) , which controlsverticalversushorizontaldivisionandthusplaysaroleinnormaltissuemorphogenesis ( 5 , 39 ) .

Innormalskin , abouthalfofthespindlesinthebasallayerwereoriented perpendicular to the BM , and about half were oriented parallel to the BM ( Fig . 2J ) ; however , Pls3 KD caused an ~ 50 % reduction in perpen - dicular spindle orientation ( 75° to 90° ) and 3 . 4 - fold increase in oblique divisions ( 15° to 75° ) ( Fig . 2K ) . Notably , the adhesion and Par3 defects seen with Pls3 - 2958 shRNA were recapitulated in embryos transduced with a different Pls3 - specific shRNA ( Pls3 - 353 ; fig . S1 , B and C ) . Col - lectively , these data establish a role for Pls3 in Par3 localization and spindle orientation in developing epidermis . Pls3 is required for assembly of the cutaneous BM We next investigated the involvement of Pls3 in BM organization by examining the expression pattern of nidogen , a major BM constituent . In the epidermis from control embryos , nidogen appeared as a thin and continuous line separating the epidermis and dermis , with occasional small patches of diffuse staining ( Fig . 3A ) . The epidermis from Pls3 KD embryos , however , was characterized by large patches of diffuse ni - dogen staining , often in highly convoluted patterns ( Fig . 3A ) . To quan - tify the defect in nidogen organization , we calculated the percentage of the BM showing diffuse nidogen staining . These data revealed that loss of Pls3 ( using Pls3 - 2959 , Pls3 - 353 , or Pls3 - 1215 shRNA ) significantly increasedtheareasofdiffusenidogenstain - ing ( ~ 7 % in control versus ~ 35 % in Pls3 KD ) ( Fig . 3B and fig . S1 , D and E ) . More - over , a hairpin - resistant DNA encoding human PLS3 fused to GFP rescued the Pls3 KD BM phenotype ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . Several additional BM abnormalities were observed upon Pls3 depletion , including gaps of up to 50 to 60 m m , suprabasal BM fragments , irregularly shaped BM , and basal layer cells completely embedded in nidogen ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . BM defects weredetectedinPls3KDepidermisimmu - nostained for the basal cell receptor b 4 in - tegrin andtheBM componentlaminin332 ( Fig . 3 , F and G ) . Despite these defects , separation between the epidermis and the dermis was not detected in Pls3 KD skin . These observations demonstrate that Pls3 is essential for BM assembly , which , along with Par3 localization and spindle orientation , is a major factor in epidermal morphogenesis . Defective BM assembly in Pls3 - depleted epidermis is not caused by cell polarity defects Our data demonstrate that depletion of Pls3 causes defects in both the BM and Par3distribution . Itis wellestablishedthat signals resulting from cell - BM interac - tions affect the establishment of epithelial cell polarity ( 40 , 41 ) . However , cell polar - ity signals also influence BM organization ( 42 , 43 ) . Par3 is one of several proteins that affects epidermal cell polarity , and its depletion impairs polarity - dependent pro - cessesinthedevelopingepidermis ( 38 ) . Be - cause both apical Par3 localization and BM structure were disrupted by loss of Pls3 ( Figs . 2 , E , F , andI , and3 ) , weaskedwheth - er dysregulation of Par3 caused the defects in BM assembly . Par3 was knocked down in the epidermis by injecting the amniotic sacs of E9 . 5 embryos with Pard3 - 1340 shRNA ( fig . S4A ) ( 38 ) .

Because mutations in genes encoding cutaneous BM proteins can disrupt BM organization and function ( 44 ) and because the actin cyto - skeleton can affect gene expression ( 45 ) , we knocked down Pls3 in primary mouse keratinocytes and examined the expression of key genes involved in BM formation ( laminin and collagens ) , cell adhesion , and the cytoskeleton ( b 1 and b 4 integrins , ILK , b - actin , myosin IIA , and E - cadherin ) . Quantitativepolymerasechain reaction ( qPCR ) analysis revealed no dif - ferences between mRNA abundances in control and Pls3 KD cells ( fig . S5A ) . In addition to being a major regulator of skin BM assembly , b 1 integrin is also important for the dermis and epidermis to adhere to one another . Loss of b 1 integ - rin function during skin embryonic de - velopment causes large blisters due to dermal - epidermal separation ( 1 , 4 ) . Al - though our analysis did not reveal any dermal - epidermal separation , we asked whether b 1 integrin in the active confor - mation could be detected in Pls3 - depleted epidermis . In the epidermis from both control and Pls3 KD embryos , similar distribution of the 9EG7 epitope that rep - resents active b 1 integrin ( 46 , 47 ) was de - tected ( fig . S5B ) . Moreover , normal 9EG7 epitope intensity was detected in primary mousekeratinocytesinwhichPls3wasde - pleted ( fig . S5 , C and D ) . Together , these results show that defects in Par3 localiza - tion are secondary to the BM defects in Pls3 - depleted epidermis . Moreover , ex - pression of key adhesion , cytoskeletal , and BM components and b 1 integrin activ - ity are all normal in Pls3 KD epidermis . Actin cytoskeleton integrity is essential for assembly of the BM Transmission of forces between the actin cytoskeleton and BM through integrin - matrix interactions has been suggested to play a major role in the skin BM assembly ( 48 , 49 ) . However , although the role of in - tegrins and their interacting proteins in the skin BM assembly has been extensive - ly explored ( 1 , 2 , 20 , 50 ) , the direct role of the actin cytoskeleton in this process is poorlyunderstood . Toevaluatethedirectrole oftheactincytoskeletoninBMassemblyanddeterminewhethertheBMdefectintheepidermisofPls3KDembryosresultsfromadysregulatedactincytoskeleton , we identified two shRNAs that target the transcript encoding b - actin ( Actb ) : Actb - 289 , which depleted Actb mRNA abundance by ~ 50 % , and the more potent Actb - 1652 , which depleted Actb mRNA by ~ 70 % ( Fig . 4A ) .

Actb - 289 treatment resulted in severe defects in both BM organization and Par3 localization and disintegration of the epider - mis ( Fig . 4B ) . To examine BM assembly under conditions of less severe epidermis disruption , we injected the amniotic sacs with a low titer of virus , which gave rise to small clones of basal cells ( about six to eight ) in which Actb - 289 was expressed while epidermal integrity was main - tained ( Fig . 4C ) . We observed a significant increase in diffuse nidogen staining in the epidermis of these embryos ( ~ 7 % in control versus ~ 30 % inActbKD ) ( Fig . 4D ) . Similardefectsweredetectedwhenembryos were injected with a different shRNA targeting Actb ( Actb - 1652 ) ( fig . S6 ) . Together , these results provide direct evidence for the profound and pre - viously unappreciated sensitivity of BM assembly to defects in the actin cytoskeleton . Pls3 localizes to the cell cortex and is required for actomyosin organization We next asked whether loss of Pls3 affected the actin cytoskeleton in the developing epidermis . Plastins can be detected in various actin - rich structures ( 21 ) , and we observed endogenous Pls3 in the epidermis at E16 . 5 throughout the actin - rich cell cortex in all epidermal layers , in - cluding the basal layer cells adjacent to the BM ( Fig . 5A ) . Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified plastin as enhancer of actomyosin activity ( 51 , 52 ) . Therefore , we analyzed actomyosin or - ganization in Pls3 KD and control embryos . Whereas F - actin was enriched in the cell cortex in both control and Pls3 KD epidermis ( Fig . 5B ) , the distribution of myosin II was aberrant . Myosin II was de - tectedthroughoutthecortex ofbasallayercellsincontrolepidermis , but the overall distribution of myosin II in the basal layer was abnormal in epidermis from Pls3 KD embryos and it was often entirely excluded from the base of basal layer cells ( Fig . 5C ) . Phosphorylation of myosin light chain ( MLC ) , a key regulator of myosin II activity ( 53 ) , was also affected by Pls3 deletion . Phosphorylated MLC was present in all layers of control epidermis and was highly enriched in the compact apical cells , but this pattern was lost and phosphorylated MLC was reduced upon Pls3 KD ( Fig . 5D ) . This observation was confirmed in mosaic Pls3 KD tissues , where the phosphorylated MLC signal was detected mainly in areas not infected by lentiviruses carrying Pls3 - 2958 ( Fig . 5E ) . The same myosin II defects were recapitulated in embryos transduced with a different Pls3 - specific shRNA ( Pls3 - 353 ) ( fig . S7 ) . To determine whether the motor activity of myosin II plays a role in BM organization , E15 . 5 embryos were exposed to blebbistatin , a drug thatinhibitstheadenosinetriphosphataseactivityofnonmusclemyosinII ( 54 ) . After treatment , sections of back skin were stained for nidogen , and BM organization was analyzed by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 5F ) . Whereas dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) treatment ( control ) did not affect BM organization , blebbistatin treatment disrupted BM organization and significantly increased diffuse nidogen staining ( 15 % in DMSO - treated versus 35 % in blebbistatin - treated ) ( Fig . 5G ) . Together , these results suggest that Pls3 is a cortical protein that affects the ability of the actin network to recruit and activate myosin II and that actomyosin motor activity is essential for normal BM organization . DISCUSSION The function of the epithelia relies on the mechanical , structural , and biochemical support of the underlying BM . Defects in the BM are asso - ciated with various human diseases , affecting many organs , including the skin ( 44 ) . Although an extensive body of work has contributed to our understanding of the complex biology of the BM , particularly in the skin ( 55 ) , our knowledge of BM assembly during development is still incomplete . Here , we have identified Pls3 as a regula - tor of BM assembly and epidermal mor - phogenesis . In the absence of Pls3 , epidemal cell - cell and cell - BM adhesion is maintained , but there are defects in cor - tical actomyosin organization and activa - tion . These defects are physiologically relevant , as reflected by the observed effects on the BM and , secondarily , on cell polarity , spindle orientation , and tissue morphogenesis . In the developing skin , loss of any one ofseveralfocaladhesionproteinsseversthecytoskeleton - BM link and disrupts the BM ( 1 , 4 , 56 ) . Focal adhesions are connected to the actomyosin cytoskeleton ; however , they are complex structures that play a role in many biological processes in addition to their ability to transmit cytoskeleton - derived forces to the BM ( 57 ) . The current study directly demonstrates a key role for the actomyosin cytoskeleton in BM assembly by identifying an actin - binding protein , Pls3 , as a regulator of skin BM assembly .

Our results reveal Pls3 as a major regulator of the actomyosin cyto - skeleton in the skin epidermis . Previous studies identified plastin in C . elegans and Dictyostelium discoideum as positive regulators of ac - tomyosin contractility ( 51 , 52 , 58 ) and showed plastin to be essential for establishment of polarity in C . elegans zygotes ( 51 , 52 ) and for cyto - kinesis in several organisms ( 52 , 59 – 61 ) . All of these processes are actomyosin - dependent ( 62 , 63 ) . Our findings extend these observations to an in vivo mammalian model . Nevertheless , the precise mechanism by which Pls3 enhances actomyosin activity remains to be determined . One possibility is that plastin - mediated F - actin bundling might modify the actin network architecture and its ability to transduce mechanical force ( 64 , 65 ) . Ding et al . demonstrated that in the C . elegans zygote , plastin stiffens the cortex by allowing the assembly of large contractile structures and by transmitting their contractile forces in the cortex ( 52 ) . Another possibility is that plastin may affect the binding and activity of other proteins that interact with actin or myosin , such as tropomyosins and cofilin ( 60 , 66 ) . Additional studies will be required to fully under - stand the position of plastin in the highly complex actin networks that integrate and control myosin II activity ( 67 ) . Our data suggest that at E16 . 5 , the strongest phosphorylated MLC signal can be detected in the apical layers of the epidermis and in the dermis . Although the distribution of mechanical forces in intact mam - malian organs , such as the skin , is poorly understood , Samuel et al . de - monstrated that epidermal tension promotes collagen deposition in the dermis ( 68 ) . Cells sense external mechanical forces and alter their be - havior accordingly . Mechanosensation occurs not only through cell - cell junctions in cells that adhere to one other , such as keratinocytes in the epidermis , but also through contacts with the ECM in cells that lack directcell - cellcontacts , suchasfibroblastsinthedermis ( 69 ) . Additional studies are needed to understand whatforces the epidermis and the der - mis exert on the BM and how this mechanical input contributes to the assembly and remodeling of the BM . Abnormal amounts of b - actin ( 70 ) , myosin IIA ( 71 ) , and plastins ( 72 ) are detected in many human cancers . A recent study demonstrated that myosin IIA functions as a tumor suppressor , and its loss induces cellinvasionthrough theskinBM ( 71 ) . Itistemptingto speculatethatat least part of the malignant phenotype of myosin II , b - actin , and plastin might be due to defects in the BM that allow penetration and passage of cells . Overall , our findings reveal a function for T - plastin in BM assembly and provide insights into how tissue morphogenesis is achieved in a complex mammalian system in vivo .

Production of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein – pseudotyped lentivirus was performed by transfection of 293FT cells ( Invitrogen ) . Viral supernatant was collected 48 and 72 hours after transfection , filtered througha0 . 45 - m mfilter , andconcentratedbyultracentrifugationinAvanti JXN - 30 ( Beckman Coulter ) . We determined viral titers by fluorescence - activated cell sorting of infected HeLa cells ( American Type Culture Collection ) . In utero lentivirus injections and controls Injection of lentivirus was done as previously described ( 73 ) . Briefly , females at E9 . 5 of gestation were anesthetized with isoflurane and up to five embryos were injected per litter . Each embryo was injected with 0 . 1 to 1 m l of ~ 2 × 10 9 colony - forming unit ( CFU ) lentivirus . Two controls were used for each in vivo experiment : ( i ) shScr ; H2B - GFP – injected embryos and ( ii ) uninjected littermates . In vitro lentivirus infections and controls For in vitro infection , cells were plated at 1 × 10 5 cells per six wells , infected with ~ 1 × 10 7 CFU lentivirus in the presence of Polybrene ( 100 m g / ml ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . After48hours , mediumwassupplemented with puromycin ( 2 m g / ml ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for selection . For all in vitro experiments , control cells were infected with shScr ; H2B - GFP , or H2B - RFP , or puromycin viruses . Antibodies , immunofluorescence , and immunoblotting The following primary antibodies were used : T - plastin ( HPA020433 for immunofluorescence , 1 : 100 dilution factor ; Sigma - Aldrich ; PA5 - 27883 for Western blotting , 1 : 1000 dilution factor ; Pierce ) ; PAR3 ( 07 - 330 , 1 : 500 dilution factor ; Millipore ) ; nidogen ( ELM1 , 1 : 2000 dilution factor ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ; Laminin 332 , phospho - MLC , and GFP ( ab14509 , 1 : 500 dilution factor ; ab2480 , 1 : 100 dilution factor ; and ab13970 , 1 : 4000 dilution factor , respectively ; Abcam ) ; pericentrin and myosin IIA ( PRB - 432C , 1 : 500 dilution factor ; and PRB - 440P , 1 : 500 dilution factor , respectively ; Covance ) ; E - cadherin , CD104 ( b 4 integ - rin ) , and CD29 ( 610182 , 1 : 300 dilution factor ; 553745 , 1 : 400 dilution factor ; and550531 , 1 : 500 dilutionfactor , respectively ; BDPharmigen ) ; K14 , K10 , K6 , and Filaggrin ( Poly19053 , 1 : 1000 dilution factor ; Poly19054 , 1 : 1000 dilution factor ; Poly19057 , 1 : 500 dilution factor ; and Poly19058 , 1 : 500 dilution factor ; respectively ; BioLegend / Covance ) ; Vinculin ( hVIN - 1 , 1 : 500 dilution factor ; BioLegend / Covance ) ; and TurboGFP ( AB514 , 1 : 2000 dilution factor ; Evrogen ) . Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 / 647 or rhodamine Red - X ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . F - actin was labeled with phalloidin – Alexa Fluor 555 . Nuclei were labeled with DAPI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . For tissue staining , skin was embedded in optimal cutting tempera - ture ( OCT ) compound ( Scigen ) and frozen . For immunoreactions , skin sections ( 10 m M ) were fixed for 15 min in 10 % trichloroacetic acid ( for phospho - MLCstaining ) orfor10minin4 % formaldehyde ( forallother staining ) and blocked with phosphate - buffered saline , 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % bovine serum albumin , 5 % normal goat serum , 5 % normal donkey serum , or MOM Basic kit ( Vector Laboratories ) . Primary anti - bodies were incubated overnight at 4°C at theaforementioned dilutions . Incubations with secondary antibodies were performed at room tem - perature for 1 hour at 1 : 1000 dilution . For immunoblot analyses , proteins were extracted with radioimmu - noprecipitation assay buffer ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and quantified using the bicinchoninicacidkit ( Pierce ) . Samples ( 20to40 m g ) wereloaded ontoa 12 % polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose mem - brane at 350 mA for 45 min . Membranes were blocked overnight with blocking solution ( tris - buffered saline , 0 . 3 % Tween 20 , and 5 % milk ) and then probed overnight with primary antibodies ( 1 : 1000 dilution in blocking solution ) , followed by a 1 - hour incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) ( 1 : 10000 dilu - tion in blocking solution ) . The HRP reaction was carried out using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit ( Biological Industries ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions Microscopy and image processing Images were acquired witha Nikon C2 + laser - scanning confocal micro - scope through a 60× / 1 . 4 oil objective or a 20× / 0 . 75 air objective ( Nikon ) . Images were recorded at 1024 × 1024 square pixels . RGB images were assembledinImageJ ( imagej . nih . gov ) , andpanelswerelabeledinAdobe Illustrator CS5 v . 15 . 0 . 2 . Semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR Equal amounts of RNAs were added to a reverse - transcriptase reaction mix ( ProtoScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit , New England Biolabs ) , and semiquantitative PCR was conducted with StepOnePlus ( Thermo Fisher ) . Reactions were performed using the indicated primers and template mixed with the LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green kit and run for 40 cycles . Specificity of the reactions was determined by subsequent melting curve analysis . StepOnePlus analysis software was used to remove background fluorescence . The number of cycles needed to reach the crossing point for each sample was used to calculate the amount of each product using the 2C - P method . The amount of each PCR product was expressed as a function of Ppid and / or Hprt . Quantification of nidogen staining Embryos that had been infected with lentiviruses encoding Scr , Pls3 , Pard3 , or Actb shRNA at E9 . 5 and their uninfected littermates were harvested at E16 . 5 , frozen in OCT , sectioned ( 10 m m ) , fixed , and stained for nidogen ( 1 : 2000 ) overnight at 4°C . BM in the back skin was documented using Nikon C2 + 60× / 1 . 4 objective that generates optical sections of 0 . 49 m m . Infected and uninfected littermates were processed simultaneously . Control data represent both uninjected embryos and embryos infect with lentiviruses carrying a Scr shRNA . Nidogen staining was analyzed throughout the back skin interfollicu - lar epidermis ( excluding hair follicles ) . Nidogen staining was defined as “ diffuse ” when the normal , thin line of nidogen was completely re - placed with diffuse staining . Measurements of diffuse nidogen repre - sent the ratio between the length of diffuse nidogen and the total length of the BM . Measurements were performed using the “ segmen - ted line ” tool in ImageJ . S C I E N C E S I G N A L I N G | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Dor - On et al . , Sci .

Infected embryos and uninfected littermate controls were processed simultaneously . The back skin keratinocytes were docu - mented using a Nikon C2 + 60× / 1 . 4 objective that generates optical sections of 0 . 49 m m . The “ Polygon selection ” tool in ImageJ was used to calculate the ratio of Par3 fluorescence intensity between the apical and the basal halves for single basal layer back skin keratinocytes . Quantification of 9EG7 intensity Primary mouse keratinocytes were infected with shScr ; H2B - RFP or shPls3 ; H2B - RFP lentiviruses , plated on fibronectin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) – coated coverslips ( 10 m g / ml ) , fixed , labeled for vinculin ( 1 : 500 ) and 9EG7 ( 1 : 500 ) , and imaged at the focal adhesion plane using a Nikon C2 + 60× / 1 . 4 objective . Data were collected using the same parameters for all samples . The Polygon selection tool in ImageJ was used to calcu - late the average fluorescence intensity of the 9EG7 epitope . Blebbistatin treatment E15 . 5 embryos were incubated in serum - free Dulbecco ’ s modified Eagle ’ s medium ( Biological Industries ) supplemented with 50 m M blebbistatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) or DMSO ( 1 : 1000 ) for 6 hours at 37°C , after which embryos were frozen in OCT , sectioned ( 10 m m ) , fixed , and stained for nidogen , as described above .
