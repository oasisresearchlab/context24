At the molecular level , PI3K signaling involves the generation of the second messenger lipids phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ] and phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ] . There is increasing evidence that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 is not only the waste product for the removal of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 but can also act as a signaling molecule . The selective cellular functions for PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 independent of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 have been recently described , including clathrin - mediated endocytosis and mTOR regulation . However , the speciﬁc spatiotemporal dynamics and signaling role of PI3K minor lipid messenger PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 are not well - understood . This review aims at highlighting the biological functions of this lipid downstream of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases and its implication in cancer metabolism . Keywords : AKT , INPP4 , PTEN , cancer biology , phosphatases , phosphoinositide , PI3K , cancer metabolism INTRODUCTION Phosphoinositides are synthetized in the endoplasmic reticulum by phosphatidylinositol synthase ( PIS ) and consist of a glycerol backbone , an inositol ring , and two fatty acid chains ; in humans , these are usually enriched with stearic acid and arachidonic acid at the sn - 1 and sn - 2 position of their glycerol backbone , respectively ( 1 , 2 ) . Diﬀerent phosphatidylinositol kinases can catalyze the binding of phosphate groups at the position 3 , 4 , or 5 of the inositol ring , while several phosphatases can speciﬁcally remove the phosphate groups ( Figure 1 ) . The diﬀerent combinations of phosphorylation give rise to seven diﬀerent PIs ( phosphoinositides ) ( 3 ) . This variety of membrane signals leads to the ﬁnely tuned recruitment of diﬀerent eﬀectors at diﬀerent time points , contributing to the maintenance of membrane identity and the control of signaling pathways and cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics ( Figure 2 ) . There is growing evidence that phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ] is a critical second messenger in cancer , regulating vesicular traﬃcking , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , cytoskeletal rearrangements ( lamellipodia and invadopodia ) , and cell metabolism [ micropinocytosis and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling ] ( 4 ) . In this review , we will discuss the speciﬁc contributions of kinases and phosphatases to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 synthesis and how they regulate PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 - dependent cellular functions . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 GENERATION BY KINASES The synthesis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 can proceed via class I and class II phosphoinositide 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) that can directly phosphorylate the 3 - OH of the plasma membrane ( PM ) phosphoinositide PI ( 4 ) P ( 5 ) . Gozzelino et al . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 Signaling in Cancer and Metabolism FIGURE 1 | Schematic representation of phosphoinositides , kinases , and phosphatases involved in the generation of phosphoinositides . PI3Ks are a large family of lipid enzymes that phosphorylate the 3 ′ - OH group of PI at the plasma membrane ( Figure 1 ) . PI3K signaling encompasses the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ] and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 that activate downstream eﬀector proteins like serine / threonine kinase AKT ( 5 , 6 ) . PI3Ks have been divided into three classes according to their structural characteristics and substrate speciﬁcity . Class I PI3Ks are the most commonly studied enzymes that are activated directly by cell surface receptors like receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) and G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) . Besides the class I enzymes , recent studies revealed the importance of class II PI3Ks in cell proliferation , migration , and metabolism ( 6 ) . Class III PI3K consists of a single catalytic vacuolar protein - sorting defective 34 ( Vps34 ) subunit that generates only PI ( 3 ) P , an important regulator of membrane traﬃcking and mTOR signaling mediator ( 5 ) . There is increasing evidence that the three class II PI3K isoforms ( PI3K - C2 α , PI3K - C2 β , and PI3K - C2 γ ) have distinct and non - overlapping cellular roles . Class II PI3Ks generate PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 from PI and PI ( 4 ) P , respectively , on spatially deﬁned membrane sections regulating clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 7 ) , primary cilium function ( 8 ) , and insulin signaling and sensitivity ( 9 ) . The three isoforms of class II PI3Ks are homologous in sequence but diﬀer in catalytic activities and biological functions . In particular , PI3K - C2 α and PI3K - C2 β are expressed in a wide range of tissues where they are catalytically active in several subcellular compartments , diﬀerently from PI3K - C2 γ isoform that is present in a restricted number of tissues ( 6 ) . Several papers showed a dose - dependent eﬀect of PI3K - C2 α on proliferation ( 10 , 11 ) , emerging as the ﬁrst tumor suppressor of the PI3Ks in breast cancer ( 11 ) . Increased levels of PI3K - C2 β expression promote tumorigenesis in breast , ovarian , prostate neuroblastoma , and esophageal cancers , possibly by an AKT - dependent mechanism ( 12 – 15 ) . Moreover , PI3K - C2 β expression is associated with proliferation and invasion in breast cancer , being highly expressed in lymph nodes metastases compared to matching primary tumors , suggesting a pivotal role in the metastatic process . A recent study reported that PI3K - C2 β represses mTORC1 activity at lysosomes by the synthesis of a speciﬁc subcellular pool of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ( Figure 3 ) ( 16 ) . Upon depletion of growth factors , PI3K - C2 β represses mTORC1 activity through the Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 2 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 360 Gozzelino et al . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 Signaling in Cancer and Metabolism FIGURE 2 | PIs conversion in internalization , migration , and endolysosomal system . Internalization of receptors and molecules through clathrin - mediated endocytosis , micropinocytosis , and fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis depends on plasma membrane PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , generated either by dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , or by synthesis from PI ( 4 ) P . PI ( 3 ) P , a key determinant of early endosomes , is generated primarily by the class III PI3K Vps34 complex II with a possible contribution of class II PI3Ks . Endosomal recycling to the cell surface generation of PI ( 4 ) P by PI4KII α to enable exocytosis . During endosomal maturation into late endosomes , the PI ( 3 ) P 5 - kinase PIKFYVE converts PI ( 3 ) P into PI ( 3 , 5 ) P2 . The lysosomal membranes contain several PIs such as PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 ) P , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . PI ( 3 ) P can be produced by class III PI3K / Vps34 at the lysosome , PI ( 4 ) P is generated by PI4KIII β , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 is hydrolyzed by OCRL . PI ( 4 ) P can be converted to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 by the class II PI3KC2 β . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 - derived PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 regulates podosomes , lamellipodia , and invadopodia at the leading edge in cell migration . association of 14 - 3 - 3 proteins with the Raptor subunit of mTORC1 ( 16 ) . In addition , the same group reported that protein kinase N ( PKN ) directly phosphorylates PI3K - C2 β to induce its association with inhibitory 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , thus facilitating mTORC1 signaling ( 17 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 GENERATION BY PHOSPHATASES 5 - Phosphatases : SHIP and INPP5 In addition to kinases , the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 levels are also controlled by speciﬁc phosphatase enzymes that hydrolyze PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ( Figure 1 ) . In cancer , the activity of SHIP1 and SH2 - containing inositol 5 ′ - polyphosphatases ( SHIP2 ) and 3 - phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) is generally considered as a negative regulator of the PI3K axis by reducing the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 levels at the plasma membrane . The SHIP family includes two gene products , SHIP1 ( encoded by INPP5D gene ) and SHIP2 ( INPPL1 gene ) , that share 43 % of sequence identity at the amino acid level . They are composed of a SH2 domain at their N - terminal region , a 5 - phosphatase domain and a prolin - rich C - terminal region that can be cleaved , generating diﬀerent SHIP isoforms ( 18 ) . SHIP acts as a speciﬁc phosphoinositide 5 - phosphatases that dephosphorylates the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 to produce PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ( 19 ) . SHIP1 expression is mainly restricted at the hematopoietic compartment , where it plays a key role in cytokine signaling , whereas SHIP2 has a wider expression pattern , including in the skeletal muscle , the heart , and the pancreas ( 20 ) . SHIP1 / 2 are known to act as tumor suppressors , being frequently down - regulated in several types of cancer , and they counteract the PI3K pathway by producing PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ( 21 , 22 ) . Nevertheless , there is growing evidence indicating that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 is critical for AKT activation , thus suggesting that SHIP1 / 2 have a Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 3 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 360 Gozzelino et al .

( B ) Glucose uptake and insulin signaling . ( C ) Macro - autophagy and recycling cytosolic components . ( D ) Macropinocytosis . proto - oncogenic activity . Recently , pan and selective SHIP chemical inhibitors have been identiﬁed for the treatment of hematological malignancies ( Table 1 ) . In particular , SHIP1 - selective chemical inhibitor 3AC ( 3 α - aminocholestane ) is able to block multiple myeloma ( MM ) cell lines , inducing apoptosis , and cell cycle arrest . Interestingly , SHIP inhibition can be rescued by the addition of exogenous PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , suggesting that these inhibitors may have a broader application in multiple tumor types other than MM ( 23 ) . INPP5E has a substrate speciﬁcity similar to that of SHIP , being a 5 - phosphatase which dephosphorylates PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( 24 ) . INPP5E has a broad pattern of expression and it was reported to negatively regulate insulin - like growth factor 1 - mediated AKT phosphorylation , counteracting the PI3K axis . Similarly , INPP5K , also known as skeletal muscle and kidney - enriched inositol 5 - phosphatase ( SKIP ) , suppresses insulin signaling in the skeletal muscle in an AKT - dependent manner ( 25 , 26 ) . Diﬀerently from SHIP which mainly dephosphorylates PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , inositol polyphosphate 5 - phosphatase ( PIPP ) is mainly involved in the hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ( Figure 1 ) . PIPP , also named as INNP5J , has two prolin - rich domains at the N - and C - terminal , respectively , and a SKIP C - terminal homology domain . In cancer , loss of enzymatic activity of the PIPP induces PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 accumulation , promoting AKT1 - dependent tumor growth and progression ( 27 ) . In contrast , PIPP overexpression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma decreases PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 levels and AKT phosphorylation , concomitantly suppressing cell proliferation and anchorage - independent growth ( 28 ) .

PTEN is responsible for the hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . From a structural point of view , PTEN consists of a phosphatase domain that contains the active site and a C2 domain that binds to the phospholipid membrane ( 29 ) . The tumor suppressor activity of PTEN is based on the reduction of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 levels , repressing AKT activation and regulating a variety of cellular processes including proliferation , survival energy metabolism , and cellular architecture ( 30 ) . Inactivating mutations of the PTEN gene are frequently reported in human tumors , including genomic locus deletions , missense / nonsense mutations , promoter methylation , and regulation of oncogenic microRNAs ( 31 , 32 ) . In addition , germline mutations in PTEN gene are associated with hereditary tumor syndromes such as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes and Cowden and Bannayan – Riley – Ruvalcaba syndrome ( 33 ) . Although it is widely accepted that PTEN is the major negative regulator of the PI3K axis through PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 hydrolysis , there is growing evidence showing that PTEN can also function as a PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 3 - phosphatase in normal and pathological conditions ( 34 , 35 ) . Malek et al . recently reported that PTEN loss alone has no detectable eﬀect on the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 levels , while the concomitant loss of PTEN and INPP4B , a PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 4 - phosphatase , leads to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 accumulation and increased cell growth and migration within epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) stimulation ( 34 ) . Similarly , PTEN deletion inversely correlates with PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 levels in the EGF - stimulated mouse model of prostate cancer and human prostate and breast cancer cell lines . Interestingly , PTEN / INPP4B loss in non - transformed cells ( Mcf10a ) potentiates EGF - dependent AKT phosphorylation and invadopodia formation , although it has opposite eﬀects in breast and prostate cancer cells , reducing AKT activation possibly by inhibiting class I PI3K signaling ( 35 ) . Finally , PTEN loss leads to PI3K / AKT - mediated mTOR activation , regulating cell metabolism and promoting glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway ( PPP ) ( 36 , 37 ) . These results suggest a novel functional role for PTEN together with INPP4B , regulating PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 levels upon EGF stimulation and compensating each other in cancer ( 34 , 35 ) . It is possible that technical diﬃculties related to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 measurement in vitro , using recombinant proteins , and in vivo ( cellular extracts ) masked this new PTEN activity . However , the functional role of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 in promoting and sustaining cancer growth in PTEN - dependent tumors requires further investigation . 4 - Phosphatases : INPP4A and INPP4B Inositol polyphosphate 4 - phosphatase ( INPP4A ) and its isoenzyme INPP4B are magnesium - independent phosphatases that hydrolyze the 4 - phosphate from PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 to form phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate [ PI ( 3 ) P ] ( 38 – 40 ) . Recent ﬁndings report that INPP4 can also hydrolyze PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 and PIP3 in vitro ( 41 ) . INPP4A and INPP4B consist of an N - terminal C2 domain , a PEST domain , and a C - terminal lipid phosphatase “CX5R” motif and they share about 40 % of sequence homology ( 38 , 39 ) . In cancer , INPP4A and INPP4B are considered to act as tumor suppressors by inhibiting the PI3K / AKT signaling pathway in several tumor types including breast , ovary , lung , pancreatic , melanoma , and esophageal cancer ( 40 , 42 , 43 ) . In basal - like breast cancer patients , reduced INPP4B expression is associated Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 5 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 360 Gozzelino et al . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 Signaling in Cancer and Metabolism with poor survival rate . Similarly , in prostate cancer , loss of INPP4B correlates with poor prognosis and reduced time to biochemical recurrence by promoting AKT activation ( 44 , 45 ) . In follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma , loss of INPP4B expression or catalytic activity in mice is not oncogenic per se ( 41 , 46 ) . However , depletion of INPP4B phosphatase domain in a Pten + / − mice background results in malignant cancer and lung metastases by activating PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 - mediated AKT2 signaling . In normal tissue ( 41 ) , INPP4B dephosphorylates both PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , but a concomitant loss of PTEN and INPP4B results in PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 accumulation and enhanced AKT signaling , favoring tumor growth and progression ( 47 ) . Conversely , in acute myeloid leukemia , two recent reports showed that INPP4B over - expression correlates with poor prognosis ( 48 , 49 ) , suggesting that this eﬀect is not due to the phosphatase activity of the enzyme ( 49 ) . Therefore , in tumors with high INPP4B expression , the hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 can promote the activation of an alternative eﬀector , such as serum and glucocorticoid - regulated kinase 3 ( SGK3 ) . In breast cancer , SGK3 is ampliﬁed and acts as PIK3CA oncogenic eﬀector in a INPP4B phosphatase - dependent manner ( 50 ) . In fact , PI ( 3 ) P binds to the SGK3 PX domain , leading to enhanced SGK3 activation and inhibition of AKT phosphorylation . INPP4B directly activates SGK3 through the hydrolysis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , driving cell migration , anchorage - independent growth , and in vivo tumor development ( 50 ) . Hence , the predominant mechanism by which INPP4B functions in cancer cells mostly relies on its ability to reduce PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 levels . Further studies are required to better understand its oncogenic role in either promoting or inhibiting AKT activation in a speciﬁc genetic background or cellular context . It is therefore possible that the level of activity of 4 - posphatase diﬀerently aﬀects oncogenic transformation on the basis of 5 - phosphatase activity . As a result , one can hypothesize two scenarios : ( a ) When the activity of 4 - phosphatases is low , 5 - phosphatase promotes PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 accumulation , acting as pro - oncogenic enzymes . ( b ) When the activity of 4 - phosphatases is high , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 is rapidly converted into PI ( 3 ) P , and 5 - phosphatases act as tumor suppressors . Future work will lead to a further understanding of the nature of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 phosphatases in a speciﬁc cellular context and in cancer . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 IN CYTOSKELETON REARRANGEMENTS Recent studies indicate that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 can promote cytoskeletal rearrangements at the plasma membrane by regulating lamellipodia maturation , podosomes , and invadopodia formation ( 4 ) . Lamellipodia are actin - formed structures that protrude at the leading edge of the cell , which are essential for cell motility . Several works showed that the formation of these structures is highly dependent on the recruitment of lamellopodin to the plasma membrane ( 51 – 53 ) . Lamellopodin promotes the growth of actin ﬁlaments by regulating the proteins of the enabled / vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( Ena / Vasp ) family , which have also been implicated in the interactions with talin and integrins ( 54 ) . Of interest is the fact that lamellipodin contains a PH domain that mediates the binding to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , which possibly is produced by the 5 - dephosphorylation of class I PI3K - derived PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 at the leading edge ( 55 ) . SHIP2 - derived PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 also participates in the formation of podosomes and invadopodia ( 56 ) . The primary function of these actin - rich structures is to degrade the extracellular matrix at the base of the cell to allow cell migration or to promote metastasis , respectively . In particular , mature invadopodia interact with the microtubule cytoskeleton , which delivers vesicular cargoes containing both membrane bound membrane type I - matrix metalloproteinase and soluble matrix metallopeptidases ( 57 ) . Similar to the lamellipodia or the dorsal ruﬄes , the regulation of actin polymerization is strictly controlled by PIs . Indeed one of the main podosomal / invadopodial core proteins , tyrosine kinase substrate with 5 SH3 domains ( Tks5 ) , possesses a PH domain which binds PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ( 58 ) and recruits N - Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome gene - like protein , actin - related proteins , dynamin - 2 , growth factor receptor - bound protein 2 , and other proteins involved in the formation of podosomes . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 regulation in invadopodia is crucial in cancer invasion and metastasis . It has been demonstrated that , in breast cancer , the activation of PI3K α or PI3K β is implicated in invadopodia formation and matrix degradation , following integrin signaling , by increasing the levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 used by SHIP2 as substrate to produce PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ( 59 , 60 ) . Moreover , decreased Tks5 expression correlates with reduction in tumor growth , metastasis , and angiogenesis in vivo ( 61 ) . Reduced SHIP2 expression in PTEN - deﬁcient glioblastoma cell lines is also linked to increased cell migration ability . In addition , SHIP2 regulates focal adhesion ( FA ) dynamics through the hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 to PI ( 4 ) P , inhibiting cell migration ( 62 – 64 ) . In addition , SHIP2 generates PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 at FA and invadopodia , inducing the development of mature FA , and lamellipodia extrusion ( 65 ) . In contrast , increased SHIP2 protein levels correlate with lymph node metastasis , TNM stage , and reduced 5 year survival rate ( 66 ) in non - small - cell lung carcinoma and with increased cell migration and metastasis in breast cancer cells ( 67 , 68 ) . These ﬁndings indicate a novel mechanistic role of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 in the regulation of cell migration and invasion in cancer cells . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 IN NUTRIENT SCAVENGING Advances in the study of PIs led to a deeper understanding of the processes regulating insulin signaling , energy homeostasis , signal transduction , and intracellular traﬃcking . Glucose and Cholesterol Metabolism PI3K - C2 α is known to promote glucose uptake by regulating the insulin - dependent translocation of glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) to the plasma membrane ( 69 ) . In addition , the knockdown of PI3K - C2 α levels results in the rerouting of the Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 6 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 360 Gozzelino et al . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 Signaling in Cancer and Metabolism insulin signal , promoting a beta - cell switch from a glucose - responsive to a proliferative state ( 70 ) . Recent work showed that reduced levels of liver - speciﬁc class II PI3K , PI3K - C2 γ , induces the development of type II pre - diabetic condition by modulating an endosomal pool of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 required to sustain AKT2 activation ( 71 ) . PI3K - C2 γ null mice display reduced levels of liver glycogen and develop hyperlipidemia , adiposity as well as insulin resistance with age or after a high - fat diet . Conversely , SHIP2 null mice have normal levels of glucose and insulin but are resistant to weight gain in high - fat diet conditions ( 72 ) . These results indicate that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 in vivo modulates glucose homeostasis in physiological conditions , regulating insulin secretion and glucose uptake . Cholesterol metabolism involves multiple organelles , including the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , the Golgi apparatus , and the endosomal / lysosomal compartment , where exogenous cholesterol is catabolized . In particular , exogenous cholesterol is transported as cholesteryl ester by low - density lipoproteins , which can be internalized via receptor - mediated endocytosis . This endocytic pathway results in the fusion of endosomes with lysosomes , where cholesteryl ester is hydrolyzed and cholesterol is sorted to the ER or membranes . It is becoming more and more evident that these sorting routes are tightly controlled by PIs and , vice versa , the amount of cholesterol can regulate PIs turnover and lysosomal activity . Sterols and lipids can be moved between organelles and membranes by lipid transfer proteins in a non - vesicular way . Proteins of the oxysterol - binding protein 1 or oxysterol - related proteins ( ORP ) families can associate with phospholipids , uptake cholesterol , and mediate its transport toward acceptor membranes ( 73 , 74 ) . Moreover , ORP1L has also been demonstrated to be a cholesterol sensor that regulates the microtubule - dependent movement of lysosomes and late endosomes . Recent work demonstrated that ORP1L is able to strongly bind to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 on the surface of lysosomes and functions as a shuttle to transport cholesterol toward the ER ( 74 ) . Through a structural analysis of the protein , the authors demonstrated that the binding of ORP1L to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 allows the cholesterol uptake from lysosomes , which in turn loosened the binding of ORP1L to the lysosomal membranes , promoting the detachment of the protein and the delivery of lipids to the ER . Interestingly , sorting of cholesterol from lysosomes dramatically decreased in ORP1L knockout cells or when PI3K - C2 β was silenced , indicating that the two proteins cooperate in regulating the endosomal cholesterol eﬄux . Given that lysosomal cholesterol activates mTORC1 through solute carrier family 38 member 9 ( 75 ) , it is evident that both the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 production by PI3K - C2 β and the subsequent PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 - regulated cholesterol export from lysosomes contribute to the silencing of mTORC1 . Macropinocytosis and Lysosomal Catabolism In order to support tumor growth and fuel biosynthetic pathways , cancer cells are able to modulate vesicle generation from the plasma membrane processes ( namely , endocytosis ) to scavenge proteins and lipids from the extracellular space . Macropinocytosis is a regulated form of endocytosis in which cells can uptake nutrients and small particles from the extracellular environment ﬂuid phase . Macropinosomes are formed by the folding back of dorsal membrane ruﬄes that fuse with the plasma membrane and create large endocytic structures ( 76 ) . Oncogenic Ras can stimulate nutrient uptake by the upregulation of nutrient transporters to the plasma membrane and by inducing the membrane ruﬄes in a PI3K - dependent manner . Recently , it has been reported that Ras - transformed cells depend on macropinocytosis to internalize extracellular protein into the cell and sustain their metabolic needs ( 77 ) . In particular , oncogenic Ras regulates the early events of macropinosome formation through the activation of class I PI3K and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 production at the plasma membrane ( 78 ) . The actin - driven membrane ruﬄing is under control of class I PI3Ks . The local production of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 coordinates the activity of Rho and Arf GTPases , which organize the cortical cytoskeleton to form dorsal ruﬄes ( Figure 2 ) , and recruits PH - domain - containing eﬀector molecules that shape the macropinosomes , such as AKT and a myosin - I motor protein ( 79 ) . However , the closure of the dorsal ruﬄes to form the macropinocytic vesicle needs a sequential breakdown of PIs from PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 ( 80 ) . It has been observed that SHIP2 catalyzes the conversion from PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , leading to the recruitment of TAPP1 to the dorsal ruﬄes . TAPP1 is then able to recruit the actin - binding protein syntrophin ( 81 ) , contributing to cytoskeletal rearrangement . However , it is also conceivable that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 could promote the recruitment of other eﬀectors , like the SNX ( sortin nexin ) family proteins , to detach the nascent macropinosome from the plasma membrane , with a similar mechanism to CME . Next , INPP4B activity is required during this process to sequentially dephosphorylate PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , indicating that this lipid is not only a degradation product of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 but has its own functions during micropynocitosis ( 80 ) . The ﬁnal hydrolysis of PI ( 3 ) P to PIs by the phosphatases MTM6 and MTM9 ( myotubularin - related protein ) is then necessary for the closure of the membrane ruﬄes and the completion of the pinocytic process ( 80 ) . The requirement of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 in macropinocytosis is demonstrated using PI3K inhibitors ( 82 ) . Reducing PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 levels , by the use of wortmannin or LY294002 , can block the closure of macropinosomes before the circular dorsal ruﬄe formation ( 80 ) . In addition , in tumors harboring PTEN loss , the expression of class I PI3K β is required to maintain elevated levels of micropinocytosis ( 83 ) . The fate of the extracellular macro - nutrients obtained by micropinocytosis is then regulated by mTORC1 , which inhibits the lysosomal catabolism of proteins . Consistently , in amino - acid - starved conditions , the inhibition of mTORC1 sustains tumor growth by upregulating macropinocytosis and the catabolism of engulfed proteins ( 84 ) . Aside from regulating the scavenging of extracellular nutrients , mTORC1 also negatively regulates autophagy in nutrient - rich conditions through the regulation of a protein complex composed of unc - 51 - like kinase 1 , autophagy - related gene 13 , and focal adhesion kinase family - interacting protein of 200 kDa ( 85 ) . Therefore , mTORC1 suppresses the use of proteins as nutrients , limiting the cellular metabolic ﬂexibility during times of nutrient abundance . Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 7 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 360 Gozzelino et al . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 Signaling in Cancer and Metabolism Recent studies revealed a link between lysosomal position and nutrient signaling via mTORC1 ( 86 ) . Lysosome distribution is tightly controlled by a complex interplay between small GTPases , such as Rab7 , and kinesins , that are in turn regulated by several factors including PI . In particular , under conditions of growth factor deprivation , PI3K - C2 β is responsible for the production of a lysosomal pool of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 that inhibits mTORC1 and facilitates the perinuclear clustering of lysosomes ( 16 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that the lysosomal generation of PI , including PI ( 3 ) P and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , depends on nutrient levels , directly regulating mTORC1 signaling . Given the key role of lysosomes in nutrient sensing , future studies will need to address how PIs couple mTORC1 regulation via the autophagy / lysosome pathway . Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis Besides micropinocytosis , which is a clathrin - and caveolin - independent endocytotic process , CME is one of the main processes through which cells internalize surface molecules and proteins , including receptors , nutrients , and growth factors . The initialization and the timing of CME are highly regulated by a close interplay between the diﬀerent PI3Ks and phosphatases , which modify the composition of the plasma membrane in the endocytic pits and recruit several eﬀectors , such as adaptors , membrane - deforming scaﬀolds , and actin modulatory factors ( 87 ) . For many years , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was thought to be the main regulator of the process , given the presence of a multitude of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 binding proteins in the endocytic machinery . Early - acting clathrin adaptors AP - 2 ( 88 ) , membrane remodeling proteins containing BAR domains ( 89 ) , and dynamin ( 90 ) are all able to bind PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , giving a functional identity to the clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) and promoting the invagination and the ﬁssion of the clathrin - coated vesicles . However , it has been recently demonstrated that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 also exerts a crucial role in the maturation of the vesicles ( 7 ) ( Figure 2 ) . During the early stages of CME , diﬀerent 5 - phosphatases such as SHIP2 or synaptojanin are recruited to the CCP , suggesting that the levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 decline as the vesicle matures ( 91 ) . The resulting accumulation of PI ( 4 ) P is used as a substrate for the PI3K - C2 α - dependent synthesis of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 . The pool of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 is able to recruit the PX - BAR domain proteins SNX9 and SNX18 , which contribute to the formation of the narrow neck in the nascent vesicles that will be ﬁnally cut by dynamin , leading to the release of the vesicles ( 7 ) . The production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 also contributes to the recruitment and activation of the adaptor protein FCHSD2 ( FCH and double SH3 domains protein 2 ) ( 92 ) . This F - BAR containing protein promotes the formation of actin structures around the CCPs , leading to the eﬃcient invagination of the plasma membrane . Recent ﬁndings showed that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 can also be directly synthetized during the process of clathrin - mediated pinocytosis by PI3K - C2 β ( 93 ) . In this work , PI3K - C2 α is recruited to the clathrin - coated structures through its binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , in a similar way to CME , while PI3K - C2 β is recruited to the plasma membrane by the interaction with the scaﬀold protein ITSN1 ( intersectin 1 ) . The production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 by PI3K - C2 β recruits FCHSD2 , which contributes to actin polymerization and drives the mechanical force needed for the abscission of the vesicle . CME is a complex process that requires several adaptors , membrane curvature eﬀectors , and a membrane scission machinery . Therefore , the formation of the clathrin - coated pits and the release of clathrin - coated vesicles take a relatively long time . However , in speciﬁc conditions , cells can internalize some receptors and ligand – receptor complexes in a faster way , through the so - called fast endophilin - mediated endocytosis ( FEME ) , which does not require clathrin . This endocytic route relies on endophilin , a protein containing a SH3 domain , a BAR domain , and possesses multiple amphipathic helices ( 94 ) . The coexistence of these domains allows endophilin to recognize cargo receptors by itself , to promote membrane curvature , and to support membrane scission in collaboration with dynamin ( 95 , 96 ) . The process of FEME starts with the activation of the plasma membrane receptors and the production of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 . Subsequently , the production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 by SHIP1 / 2 leads to the recruitment of lamellipodin and its binding partner endophilin , which induces actin rearrangement together with WASP or Ena / Vasp proteins ( 96 ) ( Table 1 ) . Thus , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 seems to act in a very similar way both in CME and in FEME . ROLE OF PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 IN CANCER METABOLISM The formation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 has diﬀerent eﬀects in the biology of the cell : it is an alternative pathway for the removal of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , a source for the production of PI ( 3 ) P , and the origin of a second messenger . The inappropriate accumulation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 due to excess in production or defects in degradation contributes to several disorders caused by mutations in kinases and phosphatases , respectively . The main source of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 derives from the dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 mediated by SHIP . While it is clear that the tumor suppressor function of PTEN is due to the removal of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , the eﬀect of SHIP on tumor transformation was debated . The tumor suppressor role of the 5 - phosphatases can be associated to the removal of the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 - dependent signaling and consequent downregulation of class I PI3K signaling or to a negative feedback loop of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 ( 27 ) . On the contrary , it is now clear that , in a certain context , SHIP may facilitate tumor cell survival , contrarily to PTEN , due to a diﬀerent eﬀect on AKT . In particular , the removal of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 is anti - tumoral if followed by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 production mediated by PTEN , while it is pro - tumoral if it results in SHIP - mediated accumulation of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 . Accordingly , the increase in PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 levels , due to the loss of the tumor suppressor function of 4 - phosphates , is usually considered as pro - growth ( 40 ) , and mutant mice for INPP4B show mammary epithelial transformation . The SHIP - mediated increase of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 enhances the number of docking sites at the plasma membrane in order to recruit and activate PH - containing kinases such as AKT . Thus , SHIP , which is mainly expressed in blood cells , promotes MM and leukemia cell transformation . The requirement of both PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 to sustain malignant transformation is known as “the two PIP hypothesis” Frontiers in Oncology | www . frontiersin . org 8 March 2020 | Volume 10 | Article 360 Gozzelino et al . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 Signaling in Cancer and Metabolism ( 18 ) . In line with this concept , both the agonistic and the antagonistic compounds of SHIP are eﬃcient in killing multiple myeloma cells . SHIP inhibition using 3AC abrogates MM growth ( 23 ) ; however , another group demonstrated that the reduction of SHIP expression levels did not aﬀect MM cell proliferation . While the loss of INPP4 [ with PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 accumulation ] or SHIP [ with PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 increase ] is not suﬃcient to promote tumor formation , PTEN deﬁciency alone ( impacting on both lipids ) is associated with a high incidence of cancer ( Table 1 ) . These data suggest that the uncontrolled production of both lipids is necessary to induce cell transformation mediated by PI3K dysregulation . Alternatively , some phosphatases may have partially redundant roles ; thus , single mutants are not enough to impact on tumor onset . Another way of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 derivation comes from class II PI3K . However , by now , there is no direct evidence about class II PI3K - derived PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 in tumor . In fact , the only study based on a cancer mouse model and a patient cohort demonstrates the implication of PI3K - C2 α in breast cancer progression due to its scaﬀold rather than to its catalytic function ( 11 ) . It is becoming clear that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 is not only a lipid component that characterizes membrane identity but that it also acts as a signaling molecule . The pathologies associated with PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 accumulation are characterized not only by mutations in kinases and / or phosphatases but also by alterations in the PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 - dependent signaling pathway . The PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 eﬀectors contain 3 - phoshoinositide binding domains , including PH , PX , FYVE , ANTH , ENTH , and FERM . Although some proteins selectively bind to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , most proteins , such as AKT and PDK , have dual speciﬁcities for both PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 , making it diﬃcult to discriminate between the functional contributions of the two lipids in diﬀerent signaling contexts . However , it is becoming clear that PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 mainly regulates AKT1 at the plasma membrane , while PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 regulates a spatially restricted pool of AKT2 in endosomes . The AKT - mediated phosphorylation of mouse double minute 2 homolog , a negative regulator of p53 , causes the activation of pyruvate kinase isozymes , which are involved in the last step of glycolysis , preventing serine synthesis and promoting glycolysis ( 97 ) . By now , the only convincing speciﬁc eﬀect mediated by PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 is the Tapp1 / 2 - induced feedback inhibition of class I PI3K . In response to insulin stimulation , the ko for Tapp1 results in increased AKT stimulation in the heart and the muscles ( 98 ) . Interestingly , the same phospholipid mediates opposite eﬀects according to its localization : at the plasma membrane , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 downstream class I PI3K activates mTOR and pro - survival signals , while on the lysosome it inhibits mTOR in serum - starved conditions . At the plasma membrane , PI3K - C2 α promotes glucose uptake , impacting on GLUT4 translocation upon insulin stimulation ( 69 ) . On the contrary , another class II PI3K , PI3K - C2 γ , controls the endosomal pool of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 on endosomes , where it regulates glycogen deposition in the liver . Ko mice display insulin resistance and dyslipidemia with age ( 71 ) . Given its implication in metabolism and its speciﬁc pattern of expression , PI3K - C2 γ could be involved in tumors highly dependent on metabolism , such as pancreatic cancer . PI3K - C2 β is also involved in the production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 at endomembranes , in particular , on the lysosome . After nutrient deprivation , the PI3K - C2 β - derived phospholipid inhibits mTOR , suggesting a metabolic impact of this kinase ( 16 ) . In particular , mTORC1 activation sustains glycolysis and the PPP oxidative arm , promoting the expression of glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase . In addition , mTOR is responsible of the de novo purine synthesis for nucleic acid production and of mitochondrial biogenesis in order to boost ATP production ( 37 , 99 ) . It was recently demonstrated that both PI3K - C2 α and PI3K - C2 β regulate clathrin - mediated pinocytosis , a ﬂuid endocytosis involved in the acquisition of nutrients from the extracellular environment ( 93 ) . This study further supports the involvement of both class II PI3K in cell metabolism control . Understanding how PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 contributes to several diseases , mainly linked to cancer and metabolism , would be therapeutically beneﬁcial . In particular , the alteration of the PI3K signaling as well as the defects in phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes are the main causes of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 - related diseases . Given that the production of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P2 comes from diﬀerent pathways , the manipulation of only one enzyme is not suﬃcient to interfere with its physiological function . By now , the main inhibitors in clinical trials target class I PI3K , while drugs against phosphatases and speciﬁc for class II PI3Ks are still at the preclinical level and need further studies .
