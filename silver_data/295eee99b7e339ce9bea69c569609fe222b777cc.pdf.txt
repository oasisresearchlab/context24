De Camilli , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , and approved January 17 , 2006 ( received for review December 6 , 2005 ) Epsins are endocytic proteins with a structured epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain that binds phosphoinositides and a poorly structured C - terminal region that interacts with ubiquitin and endocytic machinery , including clathrin and endocytic scaf - folding proteins . Yeast has two redundant genes encoding epsins , ENT1 and ENT2 ; deleting both genes is lethal . We demonstrate that the ENTH domain is both necessary and sufﬁcient for viability of ent1 (cid:1) ent 2 (cid:1) cells . Mutational analysis of the ENTH domain re - vealed a surface patch that is essential for viability and that binds guanine nucleotide triphosphatase - activating proteins for Cdc42 , a critical regulator of cell polarity in all eukaryotes . Furthermore , the epsins contribute to regulation of speciﬁc Cdc42 signaling path - ways in yeast cells . These data support a model in which the epsins function as spatial and temporal coordinators of endocytosis and cell polarity . actin (cid:1) endocytosis (cid:1) polarity E ndocytosis is an essential mechanism for internalizing extracel - lular material and controlling the composition of the plasma membrane ; this is critical for cellular homeostasis , including down - regulation of signaling receptors and recycling of transmembrane proteins such as v - SNAREs that reside transiently at the plasma membrane ( 1 ) . Many cytosolic proteins that contribute to the mechanisms and regulation of endocytosis have been identified , but assigning precise functions to each protein has been more chal - lenging ( 2 , 3 ) . Some of these proteins may also participate in multiple steps or pathways ( 4 , 5 ) , either related to or independent from endocytosis , further complicating the elucidation of their function ( s ) . Additionally , roles for the actin cytoskeleton in regu - lating or effecting specific stages of endocytosis are another active area of investigation ( 2 ) . One goal is to identify multifunctional proteins that coordinate these various cellular processes . The epsin proteins are proposed to function as endocytic clathrin adaptors for ubiquitinated cargo ( 6 , 7 ) . They are found in all eukaryotes and have an N - terminal phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] - binding epsin N - terminal ho - mology ( ENTH ) domain , two ubiquitin interaction motifs , and several peptide ligands that bind components of the endocytic machinery ( 7 ) . In addition to putative adaptor roles , it has been shown previously that mammalian epsin binds RalBP1 (cid:2) RLIP76 , a GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) for Cdc42 and Rac1 ( 8 ) . RalBP1 has been implicated in endocytosis , because it binds the plasma membrane clathrin adaptor AP - 2 ( 8 ) . The Cdc42 and Rac GTPases are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton ( 9 ) , thus suggesting that this complex links signaling , endocytosis , and actin cytoskeleton regulation . The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has two epsins , Ent1 and Ent2 ; deleting either alone leads to no detectable phenotype , but a double deletion is lethal ( 10 ) . Here we show that the ENTH domain of yeast epsin is necessary and sufficient for viability of ent1 (cid:1) ent2 (cid:1) cells ( (cid:1)(cid:1) ) . The essential function requires a patch of residues , conserved only in the ENTH domains of epsin proteins , that interacts with Cdc42 GAPs . Our results indicate that this interaction regulates levels of activated Cdc42 in vivo , and that an [ epsin (cid:1) GAP ] complex plays a critical physiological role together with specific Cdc42 effectors . Furthermore , Cdc42 regulation via epsins is likely to be conserved in higher eukaryotes . Based on these data , we propose a model in which the epsins link the endocytic and cell polarity machineries to coordinate membrane and cytoskeletal pathways in response to polarized signals . Results The ENTH Domain Is Sufficient for Viability . To determine which regions of epsin contribute to its essential role , we used (cid:1)(cid:1) containing a wild - type ENT1 or ENT2 plasmid and a marker for counterselection on a toxic compound ; this allows for shuffling of mutated epsin plasmids with a different selection marker and evicting the original one . Cells will not grow on plates containing the toxic compound [ 5 - fluoroorotic acid or 5 - fluoroanthranilic acid (cid:2) alcohol ( 5 - FAA ) ] if the new plasmid encodes a protein that cannot fulfill the essential function of the wild - type epsin ; this assay is used throughout . The ENTH domain of either Ent1 or Ent2 , with or without an N - terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag and expressed from either endogenous or methionine ( Met ) - regulated MET25 promoters , was both necessary and sufficient for (cid:1)(cid:1) viability ( Fig . 1 A and data not shown ) . The ENTH domain of the related proteins Ent3or Ent4didnot complement (cid:1)(cid:1) ( Fig . 1 A anddatanot shown ) . Thus , the epsin ENTH domain is required for cell viability . To identify candidate regions of epsin ENTH domains that could mediate essential functions , we compared the sequences of S . cerevisiae Ent1 (cid:2) 2 ENTH domains with the homologous domains from Drosophila melanogaster ( liquid facets ) and Xe - nopus laevis ( MP90 ) epsin , which also complement (cid:1)(cid:1) ( ref . 11 and our unpublished results ) . We found three residues ( Y100 , T104 , and E137 ) that were both conserved exclusively in epsin ENTH domains and also different in all other nonessential ENTH and AP180 N - terminal homology domain - containing proteins encoded by the yeast genome ( Ent3 , Ent4 , Ent5 , Conﬂict of interest statement : No conﬂicts declared .

These three candidate essential residues were predicted to be on the surface of a model for the folded domain ( Fig . 1 B ) ; moreover , T104 had been found previously as a critical residue in epsin function ( 10 ) . To test their functional importance , we individually mutated these three residues to a corresponding residue found in a non - complementing ENTH (cid:2) AP180 N - terminal homology domain ( Y100R , T104D , and E137G ) and asked whether the mutant ENTH domains could fulfill the essential domain function . ENTH1 Y100R and ENTH1 T104D domains did not complement (cid:1)(cid:1) when expressed from the endogenous promoter ( Fig . 1 C and Fig . 7 A , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . Western blotting confirmed that wild - type or mutant ENTH domain proteins was stable ( data not shown ) . Purified recombinant wild - type and mutant ENTH domains had nearly identical struc - tures , based on fluorescence emission of two tryptophan residues ( W70 and W94 ; Fig . 8 A , which is published as supporting infor - mation on the PNAS web site ) . Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the ENTH1 domains were properly folded , their denaturation being centered at 52 . 5°C ( data not shown ) . ENTH domain lipid - binding activity was also preserved in the ENTH1 Y100R domain ; it bound IP 6 , which mimics the head group of phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( 12 ) , with a binding affin - ity and enthalpy identical to the ENTH1 WT domain ( K d (cid:2) 39 (cid:3) 6 mM , (cid:1) H (cid:2) (cid:4) 2 . 2 (cid:3) 0 . 9 kcal (cid:2) mol ; Fig . 8 B ) . Thus , the inviability associated with the mutation of Y100 or T104 is unlikely to be caused by gross misfolding of the mutant domains . These results also suggest that the essential function of the ENTH domain mediated by the Y100 (cid:2) T104 patch is independent of lipid binding . ENTH domains with lipid - binding mutations partially comple - mented (cid:1)(cid:1) , further suggesting independent functions for lipid binding and the Y100 (cid:2) T104 patch ( Fig . 8 C ) . ENTH1 Y100R Phenotypes . Although ENTH1 Y100R could not comple - ment (cid:1)(cid:1) when expressed from the endogenous promoter , cells with higher - level expression from the regulated MET25 promoter were viable , although they grew more slowly than ENTH1 WT cells ( Fig . 1 C ) . In contrast , even high - level expression of ENTH1 T104D could not support (cid:1)(cid:1) viability ( Fig . 7 B ) . This suggests that ENTH1 Y100R acts as a hypomorphic allele . Thus , we used plasmids encoding ENTH1 WT or ENTH1 Y100R domains expressed from the MET25 promoter to study in vivo the effect of mutating the Y100 (cid:2) T104 essential patch . Cells with these plasmids grown in 0 – 0 . 02 mM Met had the highest protein levels ; those grown in higher Met concen - trations ( 0 . 2 – 2 mM ) had lower protein levels ( Fig . 9 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . ENTH1 Y100R - expressing cells grown in 1 mM Met ( low protein levels ) exhibited dramatically slow growth , inviability at 37°C , and greatly enlarged , fragile , and often broken cells ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . Sites of cell wall synthesis , secretion , and endocytosis in yeast correlate with the polarized locations of F - actin - containing struc - tures ( 13 , 14 ) .

Unlike the normal actin organization observed in ENTH1 WT cells , cortical patches were not polarized in the buds and few , if any , actin cables were visible in ENTH1 Y100R cells ( Fig . 2 C ) . Thus , mutation of the essential patch of the ENTH domain altered cell growth , morphology , and polarity . These data also demonstrate that a wild - type ENTH domain is the minimal functional unit of the epsin molecule required to maintain proper actin organization (cid:2) polarity ( Fig . 2 C ) . Interestingly , under the conditions of our exper - iments , the Ste3 mating pheromone receptor is endocytosed nor - mally in both ENTH1 WT and ENTH1 Y100R cells ( Fig . 2 D ; see Discussion ) . ENTH Domains Bind Cdc42 GAPs . Because the lipid - binding activity of the ENTH domain appeared to be dispensable for the functions mediated by the Y100 (cid:2) T104 patch , we hypothesized that this essential region might bind proteins . A yeast two - hybrid screen with an ENTH1 WT bait versus a yeast cDNA prey library identified fragments from all three known Cdc42 GAP proteins , one each for Rga1 and Bem3 and two for Rga2 . Prey plasmids encoding each GAP interacted with baits for both ENTH1 (cid:2) 2 WT , as indicated by activation of the reporter genes ADE2 , HIS3 , and lacZ ( Fig . 3 A Top and data not shown ) . The interactions were confirmed to be both direct and specific by in vitro recombinant protein - binding assays . GST - Rga1 (cid:2) 2 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione - agarose beads were incubated with purified His 6 (cid:4) - ENTH1 (cid:2) 2 ; bound His 6 (cid:4) - ENTH domains were detected by Western blotting with anti - His 6 (cid:4) antibody ( Fig . 3 B Upper ) . Endogenous Ent1 from yeast lysates was also pulled down by GST - Rga2 immobilized on glutathione beads ( data not shown ) . Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments gave an approximate affinity for the ENTH1 – Rga2 interaction as a K d of (cid:6) 0 . 6 mM ( data not shown ; see Supporting Text , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The ENTH1 – Rga1 interaction appears to be considerably weaker . Directed two - hybrid experiments showed a reduced interaction when ENTH1 Y100R bait was paired with the Cdc42 GAPs ( Fig . 3 A Middle ) . More severe impairment of the ENTH1 – GAP interaction was seen with ENTH1 T104D or ENTH1 Y100R , T104D as bait ( Fig . 3 A Bottom ) . A role for the essential patch in the interaction was confirmed by in vitro binding assays showing reduced His - 6 - ENTH1 Y100R – Rga2 interactions ( Fig . 3 B Lower ) . Together , our data indicate that the ENTH domain interacts with Cdc42 GAPs , and that this interaction depends upon the essential patch contain - ing the Y100 and T104 residues . To complement these data , the minimal region of Rga2 that binds to ENTH1 WT was mapped by using GST pull - down assays with Rga2 truncations ( Fig . 3 C ) . The ENTH - binding site ( EBS ) corresponded to Rga2 604 – 786 . Interest - ingly , Rga2 710 – 721 shows sequence homology with the more diver - gent Cdc42 GAP , Bem3 ( Bem3 425 – 433 ) . Preliminary data suggest that this homology region is involved in , but not sufficient for , ENTH domain recognition ( data not shown ) . In Vivo Requirement for ENTH Domain – Cdc42 GAP Interaction . To address the role of Cdc42 GAP binding to the ENTH domain , we used several strategies predicted to influence [ ENTH (cid:1) GAP ] complex formation in vivo . ImpairedENTH – Cdc42GAPinteractionleadstodecreasedviabilityandcell polarity defects . We affected the equilibrium of [ ENTH (cid:1) GAP ] complex formation by manipulating each interaction partner ( im - pairing the ENTH - binding affinity or decreasing the GAP dosage ) or by adding a Cdc42 GAP competitor . First , mutations in the ENTHdomainthataffectitsinteractionwithCdc42GAPs , yielding low levels of [ ENTH (cid:1) GAP ] complex , led to impaired cell viability and cell polarity defects ( Figs . 1 C and 7 A ) . Second , (cid:1)(cid:1) with lower levels of intracellular GAPs were obtained by deleting RGA1 . rga1 (cid:1) in (cid:1)(cid:1) cells expressing ENTH1 WT were temperature - sensitive , and the phenotypes were enhanced with rga1 (cid:1) in (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:5) ENTH1 Y100R cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . We also used competitive inhibition of the ENTH – GAP inter - action by overexpressing the Rga2 EBS . High levels of EBS expression in endogenous ENTH1 WT cells yielded morphology and actin disorganization similar to ENTH1 Y100R cells ( Fig . 4 B ) . These data indicate a dominant negative consequence of EBS expression consistent with competition for the endogenous interaction and suggest that the ENTH – Rga2 interaction is important for normal cell physiology . Enhanced ENTH1 Y100R – Cdc42 GAP interaction alleviates ENTH1 Y100R phe - notypes . An in vivo role for the ENTH1 – Cdc42 GAP interaction predicts that promoting the formation of [ ENTH1 Y100R (cid:1) GAP ] complexes by overexpressing either binding partner ( ENTH1 Y100R or GAP ) should suppress the ENTH1 Y100R phenotypes . Fig . 1 C shows that increased levels of ENTH1 Y100R improve ENTH1 Y100R cell phenotypes . Conversely , overexpressing either Rga1 or Rga2 improved growth on hyposmotic media and at 37°C ( Fig . 4 C ) . Overexpression of Bem3 only mildly rescued ENTH1 Y100R pheno - types ( Table 1 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ; data not shown ) . In contrast , Bem2 , a Rho GAP for both Rho1 ( 17 ) and Cdc42 ( 18 ) , did not suppress ENTH1 Y100R phenotypes when overexpressed ( Table 1 ) . Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP Levels Depend on the ENTH Domain . Ourdataindicatethat impairing the ENTH – GAP interaction leads to cell viability and polarity defects , whereas promoting the formation of the [ ENTH1 Y100R (cid:1) GAP ] complex partially suppresses the ENTH1 Y100R cell phenotypes . Because the newly identified ENTH interaction partners are Cdc42 regulators , we asked whether Cdc42 activation might be affected by the ENTH1 Y100R mutation by Fig . 3 . The ENTH domain binds Cdc42 GTPase activating proteins . ( A ) ENTH domains interact with Cdc42 GAPs . Yeast two - hybrid cells with plasmids encoding GAL4 DNA - binding domain fusions to ENTH1 WT , ENTH1 Y100R , ENTH1 T104D , ENTH1 Y100R , T104D , ENTH2 WT , or mouse p53 ( mp53 ) , and GAL4 activation domain fusions to Rga1 , Rga2 , Bem3 , or SV40 T - large antigen ( T - LAg ) weregrownonplateslackinghistidineandadenineandcontaining10 mM 3 - amino - triazole .

The Cdc42 (cid:2) Rac interactive binding ( CRIB ) domain of the p21 - activated kinase 1 binds specifically to the GTP - bound form of Cdc42 ( 19 ) . A GST - CRIB fusion protein immobilized on glutathi - one beads was incubated with yeast lysates ; bound GFP - Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP was visualized by Western blotting with anti - GFP antibody . Total Cdc42 present in the lysates was measured by Western blotting with anti - GFP ( not shown ) or by loading with nonhydrolyzable GTP (cid:2) S and pulling down with CRIB beads as described above , as a measure of the total pool that can be activated ( Fig . 4 D ) . Amounts of GFP - Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP vs . GFP - Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP (cid:2) S were quantified by densitometry after Western blotting . We found a 62 % reduction in Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP in ENTH1 Y100R cells relative to wild - type or ENTH1 WT cells ( Fig . 4 D ) , indicating a dependence of Cdc42 regulation on ENTH1 function . Similar results were ob - tained for endogenous Cdc42 ( data not shown ) . Attempts to demonstrate in vitro a direct regulation of the Cdc42 GAP activity by ENTH domain binding were unsuccessful . This suggests that full - length GAP , other proteins , posttranslational modifications , or localization - dependent events are required for the epsin - dependent effects observed in vivo . Thus , our data indicate that , at least in vivo , ENTH1 Y100R mutants with reduced interaction with Cdc42 GAPs exhibit enhanced inactivation ( or deficient activation ) of Cdc42 - regulated pathways . The Cdc42 - Dependent Gic1 (cid:2) 2 - Bem1 Pathway Depends on the ENTH Domain Essential Patch . Next we asked whether overexpression of downstream Cdc42 effectors could bypass the deficiency in acti - vatedCdc42andrescuesomeoftheENTH1 Y100R phenotypes . Only asubsetofCdc42effectors ( Gic1 , Gic2 , andtoalesserextentBem1 ) allowed growth of ENTH1 Y100R cells at 37°C , on hyposmotic medium at 30°C , or in 1 mM Met ( Fig . 5 A and data not shown ) . Overexpression of other Cdc42 effectors , including the protein kinases Ste20 and Cla4 or the formin Bni1 , did not improve ENTH1 Y100R cell growth on either hyposmotic media or at 37°C ( data not shown ) . A complete list of all proteins tested , including other Cdc42 effectors and Rho1 effectors , is in Table 1 . In agreement with the above results , deleting either GIC1 or GIC2 further reduced growth of ENTH1 Y100R cells ( Fig . 5 B ) . Together , the results suggest a role for the ENTH domain in the Gic1 (cid:2) 2 - Bem1 specific branch downstream of Cdc42 . Interestingly , a physical interaction between Rga1 and Gic2 has been reported ( 20 ) , suggesting possible synergism between these two Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP - binding proteins . Moreover , both GAPs and Gics have been implicated in cell polarity regulation ( 21 ) . ENTH Domain Regulation of Cdc42 Is Conserved in Higher Eukaryotes . The Y100 (cid:2) T104 (cid:2) E137 patch is conserved in the ENTH domain of metazoans ; thus , we asked whether the function of this patch is conserved in mammals . The rat epsin1 ENTH domain ( RnENTH1 ) , expressed from the MET25 promoter , comple - mented (cid:1)(cid:1) yeast cells ( Fig . 6 A ) . Importantly , these cells also had normal levels of activated Cdc42 , by using the same GST - CRIB assay described above ( Fig . 6 B ) and bound the Rga proteins in vitro ( Fig . 6 C ) . Individual mutation of the corresponding essential residues , Y101R and T105D , yielded nonfunctional ENTH do - mains ( Fig . 6 A and data not shown ) . Western blotting showed that each domain was stable ( data not shown ) . Additional evidence supporting functional conservation of ENTH domains was obtained by transfecting S . cerevisiae ENTH1 or ENTH2 into human HeLa cells . Immunofluorescence experi - ments showed significant colocalization between the yeast ENTH domains and peripheral F - actin - rich structures ( Fig . 6 D ) . Costain - ing was enriched in filopodia and lamellipodia , which are sites of Cdc42 and Rac activity , but not in stress fibers , which depend upon the GTPase Rho1 ( 22 ) . In transfected HeLa cells , we also observed ENTH domain accumulation in Golgi structures ( data not shown ) , which are enriched in activated Cdc42 ( 22 ) . Interestingly , the mammalian Golgi - localized EpsinR protein shows potential con - servation of the essential patch ( Y106 and S110 residues ) , suggest - ing analogous Cdc42 - related functions for this nonendocytic epsin - related protein at the Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells . Discussion It is well established that the epsins are key endocytic proteins ; in yeast , they are also required for viability . Here , we showed that the ENTH domain is both necessary and sufficient for cell viability , identified an ENTH domain region in which the essential function Fig . 4 .

Impairingthis interaction in vivo ( by mutating the ENTH domain , using dominant negative approaches with GAP fragments , or deleting GAP genes ) , led to reduced cell viability and defects in polarity and actin organization . ENTH domain mutations in this region are associ - ated with decreased levels of Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP , a biochemical deficiency that explains some phenotypes of the epsin mutant cells . There are many independent observations supporting this role for the epsins in the Cdc42 pathway . ( i ) ENTH1 Y100R cells have decreased levels of Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP in vivo . ( ii ) The ENTH domain interacts with the three known Cdc42 GAPs , all at least in part via the Y100 (cid:2) T104 patch . ( iii ) Y100 (cid:2) T104 patch mutants of the ENTH domain exhibit genetic interactions with the Cdc42 GAPs and a subset of Cdc42 effectors ( Gic1 and Gic2 ) . ( iv ) Cells with deletion of both GIC1 and GIC2 Cdc42 effectors phenocopy ENTH1 Y100R cells . ( v ) Cdc42 GAPs and a subset of Cdc42 effectors ( Bem1 , Gic1 , and Gic2 ) , but not GAPs or effectors for other Rho proteins , were high - copy suppressors of the ENTH1 Y100R phenotypes . ( vi ) The epsins localize to sites of polarized growth and to the bud neck of yeast , whereas in mammalian cells , the ENTH domain localizes to filopodia and lamellipodia ( and not to Rho - dependent actin stress fibers ) , all sites of activated Cdc42 accumulation . ( vii ) Other authors’ and our unpublished data show that the yeast epsins bind Cdc24 , the Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor . The Essential Epsin Function May Be in a Cdc42 - Gic1 (cid:2) Gic2 (cid:2) Bem1 Pathway . Gene deletion and overexpression studies indicated that , despite the pleiotropic nature of Cdc42 signaling , the epsins are specifically involved in a Gic1 (cid:2) Gic2 (cid:2) Bem1 - dependent Cdc42 path - way ( 23 , 24 ) . Genetic interactions between the ENTH1 Y100R mu - tant and deletion of either GIC1 or GIC2 were more severe than those produced by GAP deletion , indicating a fundamental link between the epsins and these Cdc42 effectors . That gic1 (cid:1) gic2 (cid:1) bem1 (cid:1) triple deletion is lethal ( 23 ) further suggests an essential role of these effectors may be linked to an essential ENTH function on the Cdc42 pathway . Because Bem1 recruits the Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor to sites of polarized growth ( 25 ) , its impaired function would also contribute to deficient Cdc42 activation . It is also significant that a gic1 (cid:1) gic2 (cid:1) double knockout strain exhibits phenotypes very similar to ENTH1 Y100R cell phenotypes , including enlarged fragile cells with actin cytoskeleton depolariza - tion . The absence of actin cables in ENTH1 Y100R cells is compatible with deficient function of the yeast formin Bni1 , which in turn depends on Gic1 (cid:2) 2 activation ( 26 ) . The Cdc42 effectors Gic1 (cid:2) 2 have also been proposed to act as scaffold proteins that stabilize the interactions of activated Cdc42 with yet other effectors ( 26 ) . Interestingly , a similar effector com - plex - stabilizing role has been proposed for the Cdc42 GAPs ( 27 ) . We postulate an effector - stabilizing role for Cdc42 GAPs that is mediated by a protein complex containing epsin , Cdc42 GAP , Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP , and the effectors Gic1 (cid:2) 2 - Bem1 . Besides further sup - porting the hypothesis that the epsins are involved in Cdc42 signaling , this pathway selectivity suggests the interesting possibility that the epsins could specify activation of one particular branch among multiple Cdc42 pathways . Although we do not favor this alternative possibility , it could be that all Cdc42 pathways are equallyaffectedinENTHdomaincells , butonlysomeofthese , such as the Gic1 (cid:2) 2 - Bem1 pathway , are required for viability . Cdc42 Regulation Function Is Independent of the Endocytic Role of the Epsins . Our results suggest independent functions for the epsins in endocytosis and cell polarity , because the endocytic determinants ( UIMs , NPF tripeptides , CBMs ) are dispensable for the epsin essential function ( Fig . 1 A ) , and ENTH1 Y100R cells lack endocytic defects ( Fig . 2 D ) . We are investigating the lack of an endocytic defect in ENTH1 Y100R cells , which may be explained by our preliminary evidence that the endocytic function of the epsins can be fulfilled by other proteins ( L . Maldonado - Baez and B . W . , unpublished work ) . Thus , we propose that dual functions in endo - cytosis and polarity allow epsins to coordinate these two processes ; for example , endocytosis and recycling of Cdc42 and other proteins are part of a positive - feedback loop for establishment and main - tenance of polarity ( 28 – 30 ) . Evolutionary Conservation of Epsin Regulation of Cdc42 Pathways . We began our study by analyzing the sequences of the yeast ENTH (cid:2) AP180 N - terminal homology domain - containing proteins and later found our conclusions to be valid in other species . Residues Y100 and T104 are conserved among the epsins from evolutionarily distant species and among epsin isoforms ( including the tolerated Y100F substitution ; Fig . 7 ) . We showed genetic and physical evidence that the rat ENTH domain functions like the yeast ENTH domain in nearly every respect ( Fig . 6 ) . Interestingly , an interaction between mammalian epsin and a Cdc42 GAP has been previously reported , although its physiological role was unclear ( 8 ) . We also found that the yeast ENTH domain , expressed in human cells , colocalizes with F - actin structures rich in activated Cdc42 and not with Rho - dependent actin stress fibers . Thus , the essential function of the epsin ENTH Fig . 6 . Epsin ENTH domain essential patch in higher eukaryotes . ( A ) Rat ENTH1domaincomplements (cid:1)(cid:1) .

Other ENTH Domain Interaction Partners . The triple rga1 (cid:1) rga2 - (cid:1) bem3 (cid:1) Cdc42 GAP deletion is viable , in contrast to epsin deletion , suggesting the existence of unidentified ENTH domain - interaction partners contributing to the epsin essential function . We believe that a main function of the [ epsin (cid:1) GAP ] complex is to activate the essential Cdc42 effectors Gic1 (cid:2) 2 and Bem1 ( gic1 (cid:1) gic2 (cid:1) bem1 (cid:1) cellsareinviable ) . Thus , theunidentifiedENTH domain - binding proteins need not be Cdc42 GAPs but could be factors that contribute in other ways to signaling downstream of Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP . Candidates for such factors were also found in our two - hybrid screen , Fir1 and Nis1 . Like the Cdc42 GAPs , both are localized at the bud neck ( 31 ) . Nis1 also interacts with the bud neck - localized septins ( 32 ) ; the septins in turn interact with Gic1 (cid:2) 2 and are also regulated by the Cdc42 GAPs ( 20 , 33 ) . A Model for Epsin Regulation of Cdc42 . Our working model proposes that , by binding to sites of nascent endocytosis , the epsins stabilize or reinforce sites of Cdc42 activation to establish a spatial - temporal link between the endocytic and the cell polarity machineries . At these sites , the epsins will form complexes with the Cdc42 GAPs , Cdc42 (cid:1) GTP , and perhaps certain effectors ( Bem1 , Gic1 , and Gic2 ) . Although in vivo there might be an ENTH domain - dependent inhibition of the GAP activity , we think that the key function of the ENTH - GAP interaction is to allow proper effector selection and activation to trigger the appropriate signal transduction pathway . We speculate that other proteins ( not epsin ) selectively activate non - Gic1 (cid:2) 2 - Bem1 - dependent Cdc42 pathways . Epsin (cid:1) Cdc42 GAP complexes may also promote the cycling of Cdc42 through iterative rounds of GTP hydrolysis . It has been proposed that assembly of septins requires this type of iterative Cdc42 activation ( 34 ) . The ENTH1 Y100R cells show septin mislocalization and cytokinesis defects ( unpublished results ) , as predicted for cells with impaired Bem1 activation , and therefore defective Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor recruitment ( 35 ) . Motile chemotactic cells have enhanced endocytosis toward the leading edge , where secretion and polarized growth are directed ( 36 ) . These processes also occur in metastatic cells as they migrate ( 37 ) . We propose that the endocytic epsin protein links sites of endocytosis and polarized cell growth and , by interacting with Cdc42 regulators , epsin contributes to the stabilization of the position of cellular responses to internal or external signals .
