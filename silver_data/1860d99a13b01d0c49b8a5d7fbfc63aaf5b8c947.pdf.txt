In eukaryotic cells , clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the major internalization pathway for nutrients , signaling molecules , and pathogenic agents ( 1 , 2 ) . It is implicated in numerous diseases in - cluding cancer , neurological disorders , and virus entry and is there - fore the focus for both basic and translational research ( 3 ) . The distinctive feature of CME is a layer of proteinaceous coat , of which clathrin is a prominent member . The coat contains more than 20 evolutionarily conserved proteins that assemble at the intra - cellular side of the endocytic site , curves as the endocytic pit matures , and disassembles after the budding of the endocytic vesicle ( 4 , 5 ) . Endocytic coat proteins make extensive interactions with each other , with the lipids of the plasma membrane , and with a meshwork of actin filaments that surrounds the endocytic coat ( 6 – 9 ) . Forces produced by actin polymerization are transmitted through adaptor proteins of the endocytic coat to help transform a flat membrane patch into a cargo - filled vesicle into the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1A ) ( 10 – 12 ) . Deformation of the membrane during CME is energetically ex - pensive ( 12 – 14 ) . In mammalian cells with elevated membrane tension and in yeast cells where the turgor pressure is as high as 1 MPa , actin polymerization is required for successful CME ( 4 , 14 , 15 ) . Epsins and Hip1R are believed to transmit the force produced by actin assembly to the plasma membrane because their removal stalls the invagination of endocytic pits , their C - terminal domains [ actin cytoskeleton binding ( ACB ) and talin - HIP1 / R / Sla2p actin - tethering C - terminal homology ( THATCH ) , respectively ] bind actin filaments , and their N - terminal domains [ epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) and AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) , re - spectively ] bind phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate on the membrane ( Fig . 1B ) ( 8 , 10 , 11 , 16 ) . Because both proteins also bind clathrin and other endocytic coat proteins , it is possible that forces could be transmitted to the membrane via multiple routes ( 6 , 17 – 19 ) . In contrast to the abundant knowledge gleaned from biochemical and genetic approaches , a quantitative understanding of force production and distribution at the molecular level during CME is lacking because tools to measure forces in live cells in the context of small ( ~ 100 nm in diameter ) and transient ( ~ 10 s ) endo - cytic pits are scarce , difficult to use , and often too bulky to insert into proteins without causing side effects . Here , we present a new approach for force measurement in vivo that overcomes these limitations . RESULTS The assembly of the endocytic coat relies on weak and multivalent interactions that facilitate the rapid exchange of binding partners during the dynamic rearrangement of the endocytic coat and the constant change in membrane shape during CME ( 20 – 22 ) . Many endocytic proteins contain promiscuous binding sites , multiple copies of short peptide motifs , and intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) ( 9 , 20 , 21 , 23 ) . Recent developments in protein en - gineering have indicated that the dual incorporation of IDRs and oligomerization domains ( either controlled by light or small mole - cules ) promotes the condensation of proteins in vivo ( 24 – 26 ) . We reasoned that if a mechanically actuated oligomerization domain is introduced into an endocytic adaptor protein that contains an IDR , then protein condensation could be induced in a force - dependent manner . The force required to activate this domain for oligomeri - zation could be determined through calibration , and the formation of protein condensates would inform us of the presence of force . Dimeric coiled coils are excellent candidates for this mechanical - ly actuated oligomerization domain because they are small , have well - characterized shape and mechanical properties , and can be easily introduced into proteins without affecting their normal func - tions ( figs . S3A , S4 , and S8 ) ( 27 – 29 ) . We and others ( 30 – 32 ) have previously measured the unfolding forces and energies of dimeric coiled coils and found that they unfold at pulling force thresholds in the range of 2 to 14 pN . The unfolding of a coiled coil exposes two hydrophobic interaction surfaces that can mediate higher - order oligomerization ( fig . S3 , B and E ) ( 33 ) , while a folded coiled coil 1 Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry , Yale University , New Haven , CT , 06520 , USA . 2 Nanobiology Institute , Yale University , West Haven , CT 06516 , USA . 3 Department of Cell Biology , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT 06520 , USA . * Corresponding author .

Therefore , we used this property to repur - pose dimeric coiled coils as in vivo force sensors . A calibrated coiled coil detects the force on End4p in vivo by inducing protein condensation First , we linked the two parallel α helices in a heterodimeric Gene Control Protein 4 ( GCN4 ) leucine zipper with a 30 – amino acid flex - ible linker to form a single - chain polypeptide that can be genetically encoded ( fig . S3A ) . To measure its unfolding force using optical tweezers , a single GCN4 coiled coil was tethered between two beads held in two optical traps ( Fig . 1C ) and pulled to high force by separating the two traps at a speed of 10 nm / s ( 31 ) , which is the typical predicted speed of actin polymerization during endocy - tosis ( see discussion of force versus speed section in the Supplemen - tary Text ) . Unfolding of the coiled coil was manifested by a sudden extension increase at ~ 11 pN ( Fig . 1D , black trace ) . The unfolded coiled coil refolded during relaxation but at a lower force ( Fig . 1D , red trace ) . Repeated pulling and relaxation reveals a distri - bution of unfolding forces , with a single peak at 10 . 8 ± 0 . 4 pN ( mean ± SEM ) ( Fig . 1E ) . This coiled coil is referred to as cc - 11pN hereafter . Fig . 1 . Insertion of acalibrated coiled - coil force sensor within End4p leadsto the formation of End4p condensates .

Adv . 9 , eadi1535 ( 2023 ) 13 October 2023 2 of 10 We inserted cc - 11pN into the fission yeast homolog of Hip1R ( End4p ) at its genomic locus using CRISPR - Cas9 so that the expres - sion level of End4p was not perturbed ( fig . S4 ) . End4p functions as a dimer in vivo ( 10 , 34 ) and contains an IDR between its proline - rich domain and its dimerization domain ( fig . S1 ) . In wild - type cells , fluorescently tagged End4p is present at endocytic sites and appears as diffraction - limited puncta ( hereafter referred to as End4p patches ) that are enriched at cell tips during interphase and around the division plane during mitosis ( Fig . 1F ; figs . S2A and S5 , B and C ; and movie S1 ) . When cc - 11pN was inserted before the actin binding THATCH domain of End4p , many large spherical End4p condensates appeared among small patches ( Fig . 1G and fig . S5 , E and F ) . The condensates remained visible in the cell during the entire time course of the movies ( > 10 min ) , whereas End4p remained at endocytic patches for a much shorter time ( < 50 s ) . The condensates displayed behaviors such as fusion and fission ( Fig . 1H ; fig . S2 , B and C ; and movies S2 and S3 ) , sug - gestive of liquid - like features . We hypothesized that condensate as - sembly of End4p constructs is mediated by force - induced unfolding of cc - 11pN , which , in turn , leads to the formation of intermolecular association of the unfolded α helices ( Fig . 2A and fig . S3E ) . To test this hypothesis , we created a construct where we shortened the linker between the two α helices of cc - 11pN to force the coiled coil to be unfolded ( fig . S3 , C and D ) . We observed larger conden - sates ( Fig . 2B and fig . S5 , H and I ) , supporting our hypothesis that the unfolded coiled coils mediate the condensate assembly . The in - sertion of cc - 11pN did not change the timing and number of End4p molecules recruited to the endocytic sites , and no growth defect was detected , demonstrating that insertion of the coiled - coil force sensors does not disrupt End4p ’ s function , even when the coiled coil is open and induces the constructs ’ condensation ( figs . S4 and S8 ) . We constructed several control strains to demonstrate that the formation of End4p condensates is indeed force dependent . To remove the force on cc - 11pN , we inserted it at the C terminus of End4p ( Fig . 2C ) , deleted the THATCH domain ( Fig . 2D ) , or split the construct after the dimerization domain of End4p using the self - cleaving 2A peptide ( Fig . 2E ) . We did not observe any condensate in any of the three cases , suggesting that the incorporation of cc - 11pN per se does not cause End4p condensation and that force is needed to generate End4p condensates . Splitting cc - 11pN between the two α helices prohibited the formation of intermolecular coiled coils and thereby prevented the formation of End4p condensates ( Fig . 2F and fig . S3F ) . Mutations in the THATCH domain that abolish the binding of End4p to F - actin ( RVK1010DDD in Fig . 2G and R1093G in Fig . 2H ) also prevented the formation of End4p conden - sates ( 35 , 36 ) . In all these experiments , the cellular localization of these End4p constructs was the same with or without the insertion of cc - 11pN ( fig . S6 ) . Last , by inhibiting the polymerization of F - actin and accelerating the disassembly of F - actin through latruncu - lin A ( LatA ) ( 37 ) , we observed a reduction in both the size and the number of End4p condensates ( Fig . 2 , I to K ) , demonstrating that the formation of End4p condensates depends on F - actin polymer - ization . Collectively , our data are consistent with the idea that force - induced unfolding of cc - 11pN in End4p promotes the protein con - densation of End4p constructs and that the magnitude of force on End4p between the dimerization domain and THATCH domain is above 11 pN . An array of calibrated coiled coils detects the boundaries of force on End4p To further assess the force involved in the condensate assembly , we designed and tested four more force sensors that are based on arti - ficial coiled coils ( 38 , 39 ) and a Basic Leucine Zipper ( B - ZIP ) protein ( Fig . 3 and fig . S7A ) ( 40 ) and that have average unfolding force thresholds of 8 . 2 ± 0 . 2 pN , 10 . 0 ± 0 . 1 pN , 17 . 5 ± 0 . 7 pN , and 20 . 0 ± 0 . 7 pN , which are hereafter referred to as cc - 8pN , cc - 10pN , cc - 18pN , and cc - 20pN , respectively ( Fig . 3A and fig . S7 ) . cc - 18pN was derived from cc - 20pN by point mutations ( fig . S7A ) . Insertion of cc - 8pN , cc - 10pN , and cc - 18pN into the same position as cc - 11pN before the THATCH domain led to the formation of End4p condensates , whereas insertion of cc - 20pN did not ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . An unfolded version of cc - 20pN before the THATCH domain caused End4p condensates ( fig . S7G ) . Insertion of these four coiled coils into actin binding – defective End4p did not lead to the formation of End4p condensates ( fig . S7 , C to F ) , demonstrating that condensation with cc - 8pN , cc - 10pN , and cc - 18pN was force dependent . We also observed a positive correlation between the di - ameter of End4p condensates and the unfolding force thresholds of the calibrated coiled coils ( Fig . 3B ) . This correlation is consistent with the idea that the force - induced unfolding of the coiled coils and their subsequent intermolecular association drive condensate formation ( fig . S3 ) . Together , this library of calibrated coiled - coil force sensors showed that the magnitude of force before the THATCH domain is between 18 and 20 pN . Using two published fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) – based in vivo force sensors ( 34 , 41 ) , we confirmed that force on End4p was larger than 11 pN before the THATCH domain ( Fig . 3 , D and E ) . Because the FRET - based force sensors measure force up to 11pN , our coiled - coil force sensors had the advantage to achieve force measurements in a range never achieved in vivo before . A gradient of force on End4p is revealed by measuring forces between different End4p domains This library of calibrated coiled - coil force sensors allowed us not only to refine force measurements before the THATCH domain but also to measure the force at two other locations along End4p ( Fig . 4A and fig . S1A ) . The coiled - coil force sensors were inserted after the lipid - binding ANTH domain ( Fig . 4A , left column ) or between the proline - rich domain and the dimerization domain ( Fig . 4A , right column ) . The insertion of a given coiled coil at dif - ferent locations led to End4p condensates in some but not all cases ( compare each row in Fig . 4A ) . Because the formation of End4p condensates reflects the local presence of force above the unfolding force threshold of the coiled - coil force sensors , our results demon - strate a gradient in the magnitude of force along an End4p molecule : between 8 and 10 pN after the ANTH domain , between 10 and 11 pN between the proline rich domain and the dimerization domain , and between 18 and 20 pN before the THATCH domain ( Fig . 4E ) . These data also provided internal controls for the full functionality of the constructs when the forces are lower than the sensors ’ force thresholds because the timing of endocytosis and the number of End4p molecules were unchanged for all constructs that did not condensate ( fig . S8 ) . The gradient of force on End4p suggeststhat the binding of other endocytic coat proteins to End4p distributes the force transmitted from F - actin to the lipid membrane . We tested this hypothesis by splitting End4p after its proline - rich domain , therefore S C I E N C E A D VA N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Ren et al . , Sci . Adv . 9 , eadi1535 ( 2023 ) 13 October 2023 3 of 10 disconnecting End4p N terminus from its C terminus , while pre - serving the localization of End4p C terminus at endocytic patches ( fig . S6E ) . Despite its inability to bind lipids of the clathrin - coated pit , forces on End4p C terminus were still large enough to unfold cc - 11pN , confirming that forces are also transmitted by End4p via its binding partners in the endocytic coat ( Fig . 4B ) . Similarly , when we mutated the THATCH domain to prevent the direct binding between End4p and F - actin , we still measured forces higher than 8 pN between End4p ’ s ANTH and proline - rich domains , while forces after the proline - rich domain were now smaller than 8 pN ( whereas they were larger than 8 pN in wild - type cells ) ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . This result clearly shows that other endocytic coat proteins mediate the transmission of force to the N terminus of End4p , even when End4p itself is unable to bind F - actin ( Fig . 5A ) . To further demonstrate the extensive interconnectivity of the endocytic coat , we deleted the F - actin binding domain of another putative force transmitting endocytic protein Ent1p ( homologous to human epsin - 1 ) ( 10 , 21 ) and measured an increase in tension on End4p before the THATCH domain , while forces after the ANTH domain or after the proline - rich domain remained unchanged ( Fig . 5B ) . Together , these results demonstrate that , contrary to the common belief , forces are not transmitted directly through adaptor proteins such as End4p but are relayed and redistributed by End4p and its binding partners along the different layers of the endo - cytic coat . DISCUSSION Force requirement in CME has been the subject of multiple theoret - ical work , but direct force measurements in the densely woven en - docytic coat have been lacking ( 12 , 42 , 43 ) . Only one recent study in Saccharomyces cerevisiae used FRET - based force sensors to measure Fig . 2 .

This study measured forces larger than 8 pN near the actin binding THATCH domain . In our study , we developed calibrated coiled coils as novel force sensors to induce force - depen - dent condensation of the endocytic adaptor End4p and found that , in a wild - type background , the forces directly transmitted by the actin network to End4p C - terminal end are between 18 and 20 pN . We also showed that there is a gradient of force along End4p , demonstrating that forces are relayed and redistributed across the endocytic coat ( Fig . 4E ) . Our new strategy to measure forces in live cells harnesses the pre - existing multivalent interactions in protein complexes and well complements the current FRET - based approaches ( 41 , 44 ) . Our method circumvents the need for inserting two large fluorescent proteins in the middle of the target protein used in the FRET force sensors and provides a larger range of force measurement up to 20 pN in vivo . For example , the 18 - to 20 - pN force measure - ment before THATCH had been impossible with the currently ex - isting FRET force sensors ( Fig . 3 ) . In addition , the FRET force sensors could not be inserted into two of the three sites within End4p where the coiled - coil force sensors were readily inserted . We suspect that End4p is less tolerant for large insertions closer to the plasma membrane where the density of proteins is extremely high because of the hemispherical geometry of the endocytic coat Fig . 3 .

Adv . 9 , eadi1535 ( 2023 ) 13 October 2023 6 of 10 and where interactions with other endocytic coat proteins are nu - merous ( 6 , 45 ) . The self - propagating intermolecular interactions of the coiled - coil force sensors are triggered by transient force on End4p , and the effect of force is amplified both spatially and tem - porally through the generation of condensates that have micrometer diameters and outlast the lifetime of the endocytic coat . Condensa - tion of End4p does not perturb the endocytic process because protein condensation likely happens at the end of CME , when the force on End4p has dropped below the coiled - coil refolding thresh - old , which is markedly smaller than the coiled - coil unfolding threshold ( figs . S4 and S8 ) . The combination of the small size and the clear readout makes our coiled coil – based strategy a promising tool for easy in vivo force measurements in previously inaccessible locations and an exciting platform for further development . Another advantage of our strategy is that it embeds internal controls and redundancies because all sensors have very similar folds , and every coiled coil is a sensor and a control for other coiled coils . After insertion into the same position within a protein , a folded coiled - coil force sensor detects the upper limit of the local force magnitude without changing the protein function , while an unfold - ed coiled - coil force sensor reports the lower limit of force and drives the formation of protein condensates for easy detection ( Figs . 3 and 4A ) . Pairwise application of the coiled - coil force sensors demarcates the force range . Nevertheless , our strategy in the current format measures the peak force on a protein and does not allow one to pre - cisely determine the location or the time frame of the force . The spatial and temporal resolution can be added to the calibrated coiled coils by integration into an FRET pair ( 41 , 44 ) , and the mea - surement of peak force well complements the force measurement from averaged FRET signal ( 34 ) . We do not expect the coiled - coil force thresholds measured in vitro to be notably different in vivo because the mechanical stabil - ities of the coiled coils derive mainly from the hydrophobic residues and therefore robust in aqueous environments ( Fig . 3 ) ( 28 , 31 ) . In addition , the force - independent effect ( e . g . , local protein concentra - tion , protein mobility , pH , etc . ) on protein condensation is con - trolled by the insertion of different coiled coils in the same site ( Figs . 3 , B and C , and 4A ) . For coiled coils that have hysteresis , we chose the unfolding force instead of the equilibrium force as the threshold for our sensors because the unfolding of coiled coils in vivo is unlikely in thermal equilibrium due to the long refolding time ( fig . S9 and table S2 ) . The pulling rate only has a small effect on the unfolding force threshold of coiled coils in the physiological range ( see the Supplementary Text ) ( 46 ) . We do note , however , that the physiological range of in vivo force loading rate has not been experimentally measured and may differ depending on the bi - ological context , leading to systematic shifts in force magnitude measurements ( 47 ) . Because the coiled coils are either engineered from nuclear proteins or are artificially designed , we do not expect any binding partners in the cytoplasm to compound the force measurement . Last , the coiled coils are inserted into unstruc - tured regions of End4p to avoid domain disruption , and no defect was observed at the protein or cellular level ( figs . S4 and S8 ) . We estimate the peak force on each End4p molecule to be in the range of 8 to 10 pN after the lipid - binding ANTH domain , in the range of 10 to 11 pN between the proline - rich domain and the di - merization domain , and in the range of 18 to 20 pN before the THATCH domain ( Fig . 3E ) . The gradient of force along End4p and our mutant data showing that force can still be transmitted to the membrane even if End4p cannot bind actin strongly suggest that the endocytic forces are integrated along the endocytic coat accord - ing to a “ collect - and - redistribute ” mechanism ( 6 , 41 ) . Because pre - vious quantitative microscopy studies showed there are up to ~ 120 End4p molecules per endocytic coat ( 5 ) , our data suggest that a maximum total force of ~ 2300 pN is generated by the actin mesh - work on End4p at the periphery of the endocytic coat and ~ 1000 pN is transmitted directly to the lipid membrane by End4p ANTH domain , assuming that all End4p domains are under force at the same time . These total force estimates on End4p are smaller but in the same order of magnitude as the total forces theory predicted to be required for endocytosis ( 13 ) . Total forces on the plasma membrane could possibly be larger than our estimates because we showed that force transmission in the endocytic coat is relayed through the binding to other adaptor proteins , as fragments of End4p that do not bind actin are still under tension in the endocytic coat ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . We speculate that the Sla1p / Pan1p / End3p protein complex , which arrives later than End4p in the assembly of the endocytic coat and has been shown to have interactions with both End4p and Ent1p , bridges the transmission of force from F - actin to End4p ( Fig . 5A ) ( 48 , 49 ) . The clathrin lattice is prob - ably a hub for integrating the transmission of force in the endocytic coat , as End4p , Ent1p , Sla1p , and numerous other endocytic adaptor proteins bind to the clathrin lattice , and we detected a change in the magnitude of force on End4p before and after its di - merization domain , which contains the putative clathrin - binding site ( 18 , 19 ) . The heavily interconnected endocytic coat ensures re - dundancy to robustly transmit forces deep into the endocytic coat and to the membrane , despite peripheral perturbations closer to the F - actin binding side ( Fig . 5B ) . We expect the magnitudes of forces during CME to be slightly smaller in budding yeast because turgor pressure there is slightly lower , and we expect the forces to be even smaller in mammalian cells where turgor pressure is several orders of magnitude lower . The redundancy in force transmission through the binding of endocytic coat proteins , however , is probably con - served . The “ collect and redistribute ” mechanism may be a general theme for robust mechanotransduction in vivo . Although End4p condensates only serve as a readout for the coiled - coil force sensors , our in vivo data offer a clear mechanism for the condensation of End4p constructs . We show that valency amplification from zero to two following the unfolding of coiled coils is critical for generating End4p condensates ( Fig . 2B and figs . S3 and S7G ) and that the disconnection of two α helices , which prevents intermolecular interactions ( Fig . 2F ) , disrupts End4p condensates . Our coiled - coil force sensors therefore repre - sent a new way to induce in vivo protein condensates in a force - de - pendent manner , joining currently existing approaches using light or small molecules ( 24 – 26 ) . The prevalence of low - affinity interac - tions in the endocytic coat and the large force gradient along End4p hint at the potential involvement of force - induced protein conden - sation in normal CME ( 50 – 52 ) , potentiating the formation of End4p condensates after coiled - coil insertion . The exposure of less hydrophobic residues from the unfolding of weaker coiled coils may be insufficient to drive protein condensation in other systems . The incorporation of IDR and other functional peptides into the coiled - coil backbone could overcome these restraints and enable force - induced protein condensation for low abundance or low valency proteins .

Adv . 9 , eadi1535 ( 2023 ) 13 October 2023 7 of 10 and engineering of coiled coils pave the road for additional func - tionalities based on this simple protein motif . MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein constructs and purification The codon - optimized DNA of coiled coils were synthesized ( Invi - trogen ) and cloned into pGEX - 6P - 1 vectors ( Sigma - Aldrich ) after polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplification and Gibson cloning ( New England Biolabs ) . Constructs were confirmed by DNA se - quencing and introduced into BL21 ( DE3 ) competent Escherichia coli cells ( New England Biolabs ) for protein expression . Glutathione S - transferase fusion proteins were purified by binding to glutathi - one Sepharose 4B beads ( GE Healthcare ) , and the glutathione S - transferase tag was removed by cleaving with PreScission Protease ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The purified proteins were exchanged to the bio - tinylation buffer containing 25 mM Hepes and 200 mM potassium glutamate with pH 7 . 7 and biotinylated at the Avi - tag in the pres - ence of BirA ( 50 μg / ml ) , 50 mM bicine buffer ( pH 8 . 3 ) , 10 mM adenosine 5 0 - triphosphate , 10 mM magnesium acetate , and 50 μM D - biotin ( Avidity ) at 4°C overnight . Protein - DNA handle cross - linking The PCR - generated DNA handle used in the single - molecule exper - iments was 2260 base pairs in length and contained a thiol group ( ─ SH ) at one end and two digoxigenin moieties at the other end . The DNA handle was cross - linked to the coiled - coil protein con - struct as was described previously ( 31 ) . Briefly , the protein con - struct was mixed with the deoxythymidine diphosphate ( DTDP ) – treated DNA handle in a 50 : 1 molar ratio in 100 mM phosphate buffer and 500 mM NaCl ( pH 8 . 5 ) and incubated at room temper - ature overnight . Single - molecule manipulation experiments All pulling experiments were performed using dual - trap high - reso - lution optical tweezers as previously described ( 31 , 32 ) . Briefly , an aliquot of the cross - linked protein - DNA mixture was mixed with 5 μl of 2 . 1 - μm - diameter antidigoxigenin antibody – coated polysty - rene beads ( Spherotech ) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min . Then , the antidigoxigenin - coated beads and 0 . 5 μl of 1 . 7 - μm - diameter streptavidin - coated beads were diluted in 1 ml of phosphate - buffered saline buffer [ 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 8 . 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 ( pH 7 . 4 ) ] and were separately injected into the top and bottom channels of a homemade micro - fluidic chamber . Both channels were connected to the central channel with glass tubing . The two beads entering the central channel were caught in two optical traps . The stiffness of each optical tweezer was calibrated by the Brownian motion of the trapped bead and set to ~ 0 . 15 pN / nm by adjusting the power of the trapping laser . After calibration , the two beads were brought close to allow a single protein to be tethered between them . All ma - nipulation experiments were carried out in the phosphate - buffered saline buffer supplemented with the oxygen scavenging system [ glucose ( 400 mg / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , glucose oxidase ( 0 . 02 U / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and catalase ( 0 . 06 U / ml ) ] . All single molecules were pulled and relaxed by increasing and decreasing , respectively , the trap separation at a speed of 10 nm / s . We chose this speed because during CME in yeast , ~ 100 - nm - long actin filaments are as - sembled in ~ 10 s ( 53 , 54 ) , corresponding to an average growth speed of 5 to 10 nm / s . Because actin dynamics is the main source of force during endocytosis , we expect endocytic proteins participating in force transmission to be under loads moving at ~ 10 nm / s . The data were processed by MATLAB codes as were described elsewhere ( 31 , 32 ) , and the unfolding forces were determined from the force - extension curves . Yeast strains and media The Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains used in this study are pre - sented in table S1 . Strains were constructed using the method de - scribed in our previous publication ( 51 ) and verified by sequencing of the colony PCR products . Fission yeast cells were grown in YE5S ( yeast extract supplemented with uracil , lysine , his - tidine , adenine , and leucine at 0 . 225 g / liter ) , and imaged in EMM5S ( Edinburgh minimum medium supplemented with uracil , lysine , histidine , adenine , and leucine at 0 . 225 g / liter ) . Yeast cells were grown at 32°C under 200 rpm shaking overnight to reach exponen - tial phase at an optical density at 595 nm ( OD 595nm ) between 0 . 3 and 0 . 5 . Growth assay Ten microliters of overnight grown yeast cells was diluted to OD 595nm of 0 . 1 and spotted onto YE5S plates with 10 0 , 10 1 , 10 2 , and 10 3 serial dilutions . Plates were kept at 32° or 37° incubator for 48 hours before imaging . Microscopy Cells were imaged on 25 % gelatin pad at room temperature on a Nikon TiE inverted microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) with a CSU - W1 Confocal Scanning Unit ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) under a CFI Plan Apo 100× / 1 . 45 numerical aperture phase objective ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . Images were acquired with an iXon Ultra888 electron multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( Andor , Belfast , UK ) . Monomeric enhanced green fluores - cent protein ( mEGFP ) – tagged strains were excited with a 488 - nm argon - ion laser and filtered by Spectra X with a single bandpass filter 510 / 25 . mScarlet - I – tagged strains were excited with a 561 - nm argon - ion laser and filtered by Spectra X with a single bandpass filter 575 / 25 . Fluorescent signals from the whole cell were collected with 21 optical sections separated by 0 . 5 μm , and max - projected to create two - dimensional images . The laser excitation and image ac - quisition settings for the same fluorophore ( mEGFP or mScarlet - I ) were the same for all strains imaged . Images were displayed and an - alyzed with the Fiji distribution of ImageJ [ National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , USA ] . Fluorescent lifetime imaging Cells containing an FRET force sensor ( mTurquoise2 - HP35 - mNeonGreen or mTurquoise2 - HP35st - mNeonGreen , a gift from M . Skruzny ) or the donor only controls were imaged on 25 % gelatin pad at room temperature on a Stellaris 8 Falcon laser scan - ning microscope ( Leica , Germany ) equipped with a 100× objective with a 20 % 440 - nm laser excitation at 600 speed , 512 × 512 pixels , 1 arbitrary unit ( 0 . 896 - μm section ) , 4× line averaging , and bidirec - tional scan . Photons were detected by a Leica HyD2 detector . Fluo - rescent lifetime was calculated with the FLIM module in Leica Application Suite X .

Adv . 9 , eadi1535 ( 2023 ) 13 October 2023 8 of 10 LatA treatment Cells were washed with EMM5S and loaded into CellASIC micro - fluidics chambers ( Y04C - 02 - 5PK , MilliporeSigma , Saint Louis , USA ) before LatA ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , MA , USA ) treatment . The medium exchange was controlled by the CellASIC ONIX2 mi - crofluidics system ( MilliporeSigma , Saint Louis , USA ) with a flow pressure of 4 psi . LatA was diluted in EMM5S to a final concentra - tion of 100 μM . Fluorescent signals from the whole cell were collect - ed with 21 consecutive optical sections separated with 0 . 5 - μm z - steps , and stacks were displayed using average intensity projection . Cells were imaged every 5 min , and the final images were corrected for photobleaching ( exponential fit ) before being analyzed . Protein condensate analysis For the quantification of End4p protein condensates , we created an ImageJ plug - in that identifies protein condensates and excludes End4p patches based on fluorescence intensity ( 900 - 65535 ) , size ( 4 to 500 pixels ) and circularity ( 0 . 2 to 1 . 0 ) . Our plug - in shows good agreement with manual selection . Examples of automatically identified protein condensates are shown in fig . S5 . Patch tracking Following EMM5S washes , cells were loaded into the chambers of a six - well ibidi μslide ( ibidi , Munich , Germany ) pretreated with 0 . 1 % poly - L - lysine ( Peptide Instituted , Osaka , Japan ) for imaging . The fluorescence signal from five consecutive optical sections , separated by 0 . 5 - μm z - steps and centered at the mid - plane of the cells , was acquired at 1 - s intervals for 1 min . Patch tracking was performed as described previously in ( 56 , 57 ) . Briefly , after corrections for uneven field illumination and camera noise , the temporal evolution of fluorescence intensity was tracked and measured in the z - sum – projected movies with an updated version of the PatchTracking - Tools ( 56 , 57 ) for the Fiji distribution of ImageJ ( NIH , USA ) ( 58 ) . Tracks from each strain are obtained from several movies , aligned , and averaged using temporal superresolution alignment ( 56 ) with MATLAB R2019a ( MathWorks , Natick , USA ) . We used a calibra - tion curve to convert fluorescence intensity into number of mole - cules ( 56 ) . The curves depicting the temporal evolution of protein copy number were generated in MATLAB , and the statistical com - parison between strains was performed using Welch ’ s t test on the mean peak number of molecules as shown in the accompanying table in fig .
