This is particularly true for opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , an agent which causes nosocomial infec - tions . Despite extensive study , details on the mechanisms used by this bacterium to transmi - grate across epithelial tissues , as well as the entry sites it uses , remain speculative . Here , using real - time microscopy and a model epithelial barrier , we show that P . aeruginosa employs a paracellular transmigration route , taking advantage of altered cell - cell junctions at sites of cell division or when senescent cells are expelled from the cell layer . Once a bacte - rium transmigrates , it is followed by a cohort of bacteria using the same entry point . The basal compartment is then invaded radially from the initial penetration site . Effective transmi - gration and propagation require type 4 pili , the type 3 secretion system ( T3SS ) and a flagel - lum , although flagellum - deficient bacteria can occasionally invade the basal compartment from wounded areas . In the basal compartment , the bacteria inject the T3SS toxins into host cells , disrupting the cytoskeleton and focal contacts to allow their progression under the cells . Thus , P . aeruginosa exploits intrinsic host cell processes to breach the epithelium and invade the subcellular compartment . Author Summary In normal situations , the mucosae constitute efficient barriers against the invasion of opportunistic pathogens . The bacteria inducing nosocomial infections take advantage of pre - existing pathological situations to cross the epithelium and spread in deeper tissues . The conditions on the host side permitting transmigration and the combination of viru - lence factors used by the bacteria to transmigrate are mostly speculative . Here , we studied the transmigration process of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , a bacterium causing hospital - acquired acute and chronic infections . We found that bacteria exploits weakened cell - cell junctions of the epithelium , such as those generated at sites of cell division or when dying PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005377 January 4 , 2016 1 / 22 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Golovkine G , Faudry E , Bouillot S , Elsen S , Attrée I , Huber P ( 2016 ) Pseudomonas aeruginosa Transmigrates at Epithelial Cell - Cell Junctions , Exploiting Sites of Cell Division and Senescent Cell Extrusion .

Introduction Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major opportunistic bacterial pathogen associated with nosoco - mial infections . It is the principal agent responsible for mortality in cystic fibrosis patients and one of the main bacteria linked to hospital - acquired infections , particularly infections sus - tained after the placement of therapeutic devices such as ventilators , blood or urinary catheters . With acute infections , P . aeruginosa can disseminate from the initial site of infection across tis - sue barriers to induce bacteremia and systemic infection [ 1 ] . P . aeruginosa is present in the environment and in the human digestive and respiratory tracts , but healthy people are resistant to infection despite its arsenal of virulence factors . This resistance suggests that the epithelial barriers together with the action of immune cells consti - tute efficient protection mechanisms . Indeed , several groups have shown that the apical domain of epithelial cells , when assembled in monolayers , is refractory to intoxication by P . aeruginosa , which could explain why people with uninjured tissues are resistant to infection [ 2 – 6 ] . Consistent with these findings , epithelial tight junctions have been reported to play a role in the protection against P . aeruginosa invasion [ 5 , 7 ] . P . aeruginosa ’ s virulence factors include exotoxins which most strains produce and inject directly into the cytoplasm of target cells through their type 3 secretion system ( T3SS ) , a syringe - like apparatus common to many Gram - negative pathogenic bacteria [ 8 , 9 ] . The T3SS effectors ( ExoS , T , Y and U ) are considered to be P . aeruginosa ' s most potent toxins , because strains not expressing T3SS are much less virulent both in the clinic and in animal models of infection [ 10 – 14 ] . The majority of clinical strains secrete Exo S , T and Y , all of which disrupt the cytoskeleton to cause cell retraction , or cell rounding , eventually leading to cell detachment ; ExoU induces rapid necrotic cell death [ 9 ] . P . aeruginosa also has type 4 pili ( hereafter called pili ) and a flagellum at its surface . These structures are used for movement due to twitching and swimming motions , respectively . A third motion type , called swarming , allows motility across semi - solid surfaces , and is promoted by the flagellum , the pili and bacterial surfactants [ 15 ] . In animal models of infection , pili and the flagellum are both required for full virulence [ 16 , 17 ] . Pili are composed of retractile fibers , and — in addition to their role in motility — serve to attach the bacterium to host cells in prepa - ration for toxin injection through the T3SS [ 6 , 18 ] . Pili have also been shown to preferentially interact with the cells ’ basolateral domain [ 6 , 18 , 19 ] . Recently , Heiniger et al . [ 6 ] demonstrated that pili and T3SS are required for P . aeruginosa to cross an epithelial barrier , potentially by interacting with exposed basolateral surfaces . These results suggest a paracellular route of transmigration . However , these authors analyzed the infection process using fixed samples , and provided no information on the sequence of events leading to initial barrier disruption and bacterial transmigration . Internalization of P . aeruginosa in non - phagocytic cells is known to be facultative . In epithe - lial monolayers , it has been proposed that bacterial uptake involves the transformation of a sub - domain of the apical cell surface into a basolateral - like domain [ 20 , 21 ] , which would indi - cate a transcellular route of transmigration . However , the whole transmigration process and the conditions required for its achievement have never been completely characterized . In this paper , we investigated P . aeruginosa transmigration across polarized epithelial monolayers using real - time 3 - dimensional microscopy . Our results indicate that bacteria P . aeruginosa Transmigration at Cell - Cell Junctions PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005377 January 4 , 2016 2 / 22 Competing Interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . transmigrated using paracellular routes at very specific points : sites of cell division or cell death , where intercellular junctions are temporarily discontinuous . No internalization was observed , thus precluding a transcellular transmigration route . Time - course experiments showed that bacteria induced cell rounding only once they had gained access to the cells ’ baso - lateral domain . Bacterial progression below the cells was possible after disruption of the cyto - skeleton and focal contacts upon toxin injection , and the entire process was shown to require functional pili , the T3SS and the flagellum . Results Spatio - temporal visualization of P . aeruginosa transmigration across epithelial monolayers In this paper , we investigated P . aeruginosa ( strain CHA labeled with mCherry ) transmigration across epithelial monolayers ( EGFP - labeled confluent MDCK cells ) . MDCK monolayers are formed by polarized cells with continuous tight junctions ( S1A Fig ) and constitute an estab - lished cellular model for the study of P . aeruginosa virulence [ 4 , 22 , 23 ] . After exposure to P . aeruginosa , 3D confocal microscopy images of bacteria and MDCK cells were acquired for 7 hours at different locations on the cell monolayer . Bacteria were seen to transmigrate at specific sites and to propagate radially below the cell layer ( Fig 1A and S1 Movie ) . Transmigration was consistently seen to occur via a paracellular route ( i . e . , through cell - cell junctions ) , first by a single bacterium , rapidly followed by a cohort of bacteria , reminiscent of the " pack swarming " observed when P . aeruginosa infects macrophages [ 24 ] . In contrast , A549 cell layers , formed by non - polarized cells with discontinuous tight junctions ( S1B Fig ) , were penetrated at many dif - ferent points , also via paracellular routes ( Fig 1B and S2 Movie ) . Thus , intercellular junctions appear to be key to restricting P . aeruginosa transmigration . To determine the rate of penetration , the number of bacteria in the basal compartment was quantified at different time points , in 10 microscopy fields per condition , and was expressed as a function of hours - post - infection ( hpi ) ( Fig 1C and 1D ) . Transmigration across MDCK layers started at approximately 3 . 5 hpi and reached a peak at 6 . 5 hpi ( Fig 1C ; selected images are shown in S2A Fig ) . In contrast , transmigration across A549 cells started at 2 hpi and reached a peak at 4 hpi ( Fig 1D ) , confirming the permissiveness of A549 cell layers . After bacterial inva - sion , the cells detached from the coverglass and bacteria were released back into the superna - tant , which explains why the number of bacteria decreased in the basal compartment at later time points ( Fig 1C and 1D ) . These results were confirmed with P . aeruginosa strain PAK applied to MDCK cell layers ( S2B Fig ) . We next wished to determine which bacterial components were involved in the transmigra - tion process . We therefore used real - time microscopy to examine whether isogenic mutants defective in the T3SS ( Δ pscF ) , the flagellum ( Δ fliC ) or pili ( Δ pilY1 ) could transmigrate across epithelial layers . None of the mutants transmigrated across MDCK layers ( Fig 1C ) . In contrast , with A549 cell layers transmigration was abolished by pili deficiency , whereas lack of the flagel - lum or the T3SS was less detrimental ( Fig 1D ) , although it did still greatly reduce the transmi - gration efficiency . Thus , only pili are absolutely required for transmigration with a permissive epithelium , whereas all three factors are required to cross a polarized epithelium . The three mutant strains were also used to study the link between bacterial transmigration and cell retraction , a typical effect of ExoS or ExoT injection [ 25 – 28 ] . MDCK cells retracted upon infection with the wild - type strain , while the pili mutant did not induce cell retraction ; a slight retraction was observed with the T3SS and flagellum mutants at late time points ( Fig 1E and S2A Fig ) . However , this mild effect was not typical of T3SS - induced cell retraction , rather it was related to intercellular junction remodeling ( arrowheads in S2A Fig ) .

Cells were infected by either the wild P . aeruginosa Transmigration at Cell - Cell Junctions PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005377 January 4 , 2016 4 / 22 retracted when infected with the wild type strain , and to a lesser extent when infected with the flagellum - deficient strain . The T3SS and pili mutants induced no retraction ( Fig 1F ) , indicating that junction remodeling did not occur in this model . Altogether , these results demonstrate that transmigration , when possible , consistently occurs at cell - cell junctions . In epithelial layers with sealed junctions , mimicking in vivo epithe - lia , pili , the T3SS and the flagellum were all required to initiate transmigration . These results support those of previous studies showing that T3SS effectors and pili are required for efficient penetration of epithelial monolayers [ 6 , 18 ] . Bacterial transmigration occurs at sites of host cell division or cell death We next wished to determine the factors initiating the transmigration process . As MDCK monolayers are a good model of physiological epithelia , we used them for these further studies . Close examination of all the transmigration events occurring with MDCK monolayers revealed that bacteria can use very small gaps ( " clefts " ) formed between daughter cells upon cell division ( Fig 2A ) . Like in Fig 1A , transmigration first involved a single bacterium penetrating the cleft , rapidly followed by a group of bacteria attracted to the transmigration site ( Fig 2A ) . Less fre - quently , bacteria were also observed to transmigrate at sites where senescent cells had been expelled from the monolayer ( see below ) . Transmigration sites were observed for 5 hours on 48 microscopic fields , representing 28 , 000 cells , and were classed , using nucleus labeling with vital Hoechst , as sites of cell division , cell death or unknown — when the phenomenon was ambiguous ( Fig 2B ) . The results show that cell division and cell death are the major , probably only , permissive events allowing bacterial transmigration . Transmigration occurred mainly and more rapidly at cell division sites , and was less frequent and occurred later at cell extrusion sites ( Fig 2B ) . Transmigration remained a rare event , and many sites of cell division or death were not exploited by bacteria for transmigration ( Fig 2C ) , suggesting that other , as yet undiscovered , parameters may contribute to the transmigration process . To determine whether the presence of bacteria alters cell division or cell senescence rates in the MDCK monolayer , we compared the number of dividing and dying cells in uninfected and infected monolayers until 3 hpi , i . e . , before massive intoxication with the T3SS toxins ( Fig 2D and 2E ) . In this time frame , the pres - ence of bacteria neither affected cell division nor senescence rates , indicating that bacterial transmigration at specific sites is an opportunistic rather than an instrumental event . The fact that specific cellular processes are linked to transmigration events suggests particu - larities of the intercellular junctions at these positions . We therefore used MDCK cells express - ing E - cadherin - EGFP to more precisely analyze the cell - cell junctions during cell division and cell death . During cell division , these cells revealed minute interruptions in E - cadherin staining between dividing cells , where bacteria could penetrate the epithelial layer ( Fig 2F and 2G and S3 Movie ) . In the case of cell death , senescent cells were extruded from the monolayer while adjacent cells formed new junctions below the cell being expelled , as previously reported [ 29 ] . Like with cell division , gaps in E - cadherin - EGFP labeling were observed in the newly - formed junctions ( Fig 2H and S4 Movie ) and bacteria availed of these to gain access to the sub - epithe - lium . Thus , P . aeruginosa exploits natural weaknesses in the epithelial monolayer to gain access to the basal domain . type ( WT ) , or mutants lacking T3SS ( Δ pscF ) , flagellum ( Δ fliC ) or pili ( Δ pilY1 ) .

The curve representing average cell retraction ( Fig 3A ) is shifted to the right , or later time points , compared to the average transmigration curve . This shift was consistently observed for each location analyzed . Thus , cell retraction appears to occur when bacteria have already gained access to the basal compartment . To visualize toxin injection , we used a previously reported system [ 14 , 30 ] , in which bacteria secrete an ExoS toxin - ß - lactamase ( Bla ) fusion protein ( ExoS - Bla ) , and MDCK cells are loaded with CCF2 , a bifluorescent ß - lactamase substrate . With this system , toxin injection is revealed by cleavage of CCF2 by ExoS - Bla , shifting cellular fluorescence from green to blue ( Fig 3B ) . Blue fluorescence was only detected at and around transmigration sites , and was particularly intense in cells close to the entry site ( Fig 3C and S5 Movie ) . The fluorescence shift expanded radially , mirroring bacterial propagation under the monolayer . The leading edges of bacterial migration consistently correlated with the positions of the outermost injected cells ( Fig 3C ) . The percentage of bacteria in the basal compartment within areas containing infected cells ( i . e . , blue cells ) was 80 % ; this percentage increased to 93 % when the areas were increased by 15 μ m ( Fig 3D ) , confirming the correlation between bacterial progression under cells and toxin injec - tion . These observations strongly suggest that bacteria located in the basal compartment inject toxins into cells to allow their progression . Bacterial aggregates were also noted close to the cell surface , but their positions did not correspond to transmigration sites ( Fig 3C ) . To further examine the molecular events involved in bacterial propagation and how they correlate with toxin injection , we analyzed the biological effects of the toxins on the cytoskele - ton and focal contacts in real - time . To do this , MDCK cells were transfected with either Life - act - GFP — to label the actin cytoskeleton — or vinculin - GFP — to reveal focal contacts — and the basal compartment was observed by total internal reflectance fluorescence ( TIRF ) videomicro - scopy . As previously reported [ 25 , 26 ] , toxin injection caused disruption of actin fibers and focal contacts ( Fig 4A , 4B and S6 and S7 Movies ) . Bacteria only progressed below the cells after these two cellular components had been eliminated , suggesting that toxin injection took place when bacteria were still located at cell edges rather than directly under cells . Disruption of the cytoskeleton and focal contacts then facilitated bacterial propagation , as indicated by the arrowheads in Fig 4A and 4B . Bacterial infiltration below the cells was also visible as a loss of fluorescence in the green channel ( when cells were labeled with intracellular EGFP ) at the basal side of the cell ( S3 Fig ) , suggesting that bacteria raised the basal membrane , as previously hypothesized based on elec - tron microscopy data [ 22 ] . Fluorescence was restored once the bacteria had moved away ( S3 Fig ) , indicating that cells subsequently recovered their initial basal geometry , before cell round - ing and detachment occurred . dataset .

With this cell system , mutants lacking pili never gained access to the basal compartment , while the T3SS and the flagellum mutants had severely reduced invasion capacities ( S4 and S5A Figs ) . Thus , all three factors are required for motility below the cell layer . Interestingly , bacteria without a flagellum were present in the wound in much smaller numbers than the other strains ( S4B Fig ) , suggesting an altered capacity to reach the wound . Even when present in the wound , the rate of invasion with this mutant was highly variable ( S4B Fig ) , suggesting that it is a stochastic phenomenon . These observations hint that Fig 4 .

Bacterial migration under the cells is related to twitching motility We next investigated which characteristics of P . aeruginosa were necessary for migration under the epithelium . Pili - dependent twitching movement has been described as a type of collective migration used by P . aeruginosa under agar [ 31 ] . In our cell layers , bacteria initially migrated individually below epithelial cells , but were rapidly followed by cohorts of bacteria migrating together as rafts ( S8 Movie ) . The leading bacterium progressed below the cells or under inter - cellular junctions , while the trailing bacteria within rafts mainly migrated below intercellular junctions . The instantaneous velocities of bacteria were measured on several trajectories at the initial stages of bacterial migration ( 4 – 5 . 5 hpi ) and at later time points ( beyond 7 hpi ) ( Fig 5B ) . The median velocities were significantly different between these two time frames , progressing from 2 . 2 to 6 . 7 μ m / min . These velocities are consistent with the median velocity reported for twitch - ing under agar : ~ 3 . 5 μ m / min [ 31 ] . Interestingly , the few flagellum - deficient bacteria that pene - trated the basal compartment in transmigration experiments at late time points ( 7 hpi ) ( S9 Movie ) had a comparable median velocity to wild - type cells ( ~ 4 μ m / min ) ( Fig 5C ) , but only progressed under the cells as individual bacteria , suggesting that migration in rafts requires the flagellum . These results indicate that the motility of P . aeruginosa beneath the epithelial cell layer involves a pili - dependent twitching mechanism , but collective behavior , including the forma - tion of rafts , requires the flagellum . Discussion Up to now , the precise mechanisms through which P . aeruginosa breaches the epithelial barrier have remained elusive . The fact that P . aeruginosa infection occurs in already established path - ological settings suggests that specific biological events are required to facilitate bacterial dis - semination . The results presented in this paper , based on a model epithelial barrier , provide new clues as to how P . aeruginosa transmigrates across an epithelium , and new information on the characteristics of its behavior in the basal compartment . One of the major results of this study was the demonstration that P . aeruginosa uses a para - cellular route to transmigrate , without requiring cellular internalization . In the tens of movies generated for this study , no bacterial internalization events were observed , thus eliminating a transcellular route . In previous studies [ 6 , 7 , 22 ] , bacteria were observed in the basal compart - ment of infected epithelia in fixed samples , but no information on the route followed by the bacteria to reach this compartment was provided . Bacterial pathogens do not commonly employ a paracellular route across epithelia , a transcellular route being much more common . However , paracellular migration is described for specific examples , such as Neisseria meningiti - dis which uses it to cross the blood - brain barrier [ 32 ] . P . aeruginosa internalization by epithelial cells has been described in several studies , most of which used an antibiotic protection assay [ 33 – 35 ] . However , a recent report [ 36 ] suggests that the antibiotic protection assay may not be a relevant method to assess bacterial uptake by host cells as bacterial aggregates forming at the apical surface of cells are resistant to antibiotic treat - ment . Other groups reported electron microscopy images showing bacterial uptake in epithelial cells [ 37 – 39 ] . It is thus possible that cellular models other than MDCK or A549 , or other infec - tion conditions would be more appropriate to assess bacterial internalization . P . aeruginosa Transmigration at Cell - Cell Junctions PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005377 January 4 , 2016 10 / 22 In this article , we show for the first time that P . aeruginosa transmigration across MDCK layers takes place at sites of cell division and cell extrusion , but that bacteria exploit less than 5 % of these occurrences . One explanation for this low level of exploitation might be statistical : there may be a low probability that patrolling bacteria would encounter cell - cell junctions in the apposite temporal window . Alternatively , perhaps not all division or extrusion sites are per - missive to bacteria , and this process is controlled by other host factors ( see below ) . In the time - frame of our experiments , the pathogen was not seen to specifically induce cell division or senescence , indicating that it is not a strategy initiated by P . aeruginosa to facilitate access to the sub - epithelium . Although the entry site , once used by a leading bacterium , subsequently attracted many swimming bacteria , how bacteria are attracted so efficiently below the cells remains a major unsolved question and deserves further investigation . Conversely , the formation of immobile Fig 5 . Bacterial propagation below an epithelial monolayer . ( A ) A wound was made in MDCK monolayers and bacteria were subsequently introduced in the medium . Invasion from the wound was recorded in the basal compartment by confocal microscopy at different time points , as illustrated in S4 Fig The wounded monolayers were infected with the wild type or with mutants lacking T3SS ( Δ pscF ) , flagellum ( Δ fliC ) or pili ( Δ pilY1 ) . The invasion surfaces were measured in 8 fields . The data represent the averaged percentages of invaded surfaces ( + SEM ) of total field surface minus the wounded area .

Furthermore , bac - terial aggregates did not specifically accumulate around transmigration sites . These two phe - nomena are therefore probably independent . Interestingly , A549 monolayers , which establish immature cell - cell junctions , were highly permissive to bacterial penetration , indicating that adhesive proteins located at intercellular junctions constitute a main defense against bacterial dissemination . In agreement with these findings , E - cadherin , the major adhesive protein of adherens junctions promoting cell - cell interaction is not affected by the proteases secreted by P . aeruginosa [ 40 – 42 ] . In contrast , vas - cular endothelial ( VE ) - cadherin , expressed in vascular endothelia , is a substrate of P . aerugino - sa ' s elastase , LasB , making the vascular barrier vulnerable to invasion [ 41 ] . In this study , we observed that the interrupted E - cadherin junctions between dividing MDCK cells could be exploited by bacteria for transmigration . Imperfect sealing following divi - sion may be a rare phenomenon , which would explain why transmigration occurs at such a low rate . Alternatively , given that T3SS - deficient bacteria were unable to transmigrate , the bac - terium may take advantage of exposed lateral membranes to inject T3SS toxins , eventually leading to loss of cell - cell contacts . In cell monolayers , senescent cells are extruded apically . E - cadherin and tight junctions are lost by the apoptotic cells [ 43 – 46 ] , but the neighboring cells rapidly move in to seal the gap . In this location , active junction remodeling takes place over a number of hours [ 29 ] . We observed that E - cadherin labeling was interrupted in the newly - formed junction , where bacterial pene - tration could occur . Further work will be needed to determine whether the gap exploited by bacteria for transmigration during cell division is pre - existing or triggered by the bacteria . In systemic infections , P . aeruginosa mainly enters through the epithelium of lung alveoli . In normal situations , the alveolar epithelium is a slowly proliferating cell population , whereas in an injured epithelium the proliferation rate is considerably increased to allow for the replace - ment of injured cells [ 47 , 48 ] . Thus , opportunities for mucosal penetration by bacteria may be available in these situations . However , the precise mechanisms of cell extrusion and cell divi - sion in this organ , particularly at the level of cell junctions , are unknown and constitute a major hurdle to our understanding of P . aeruginosa dissemination . Bacterial transmigration across MDCK layers requires pili , the T3SS , and the flagellum ; propagation below the monolayer involves the T3SS and pili , whereas the flagellum is only nec - essary for optimal invasion . The results presented here are the first to indicate involvement of the flagellum in P . aeruginosa transmigration across epithelial monolayers . As previously reported [ 49 ] , like most Gram - negative pathogenic bacteria , P . aeruginosa does not inject T3SS toxins into the apical domain of epithelial cells . The cell ' s basolateral domain must therefore be accessible for pili - dependent bacterium - host cell contact to allow T3SS toxin injection [ 6 , 18 ] . Therefore , it is not surprising that the T3SS and the pili mutants exhibited similar transmigra - tion - and propagation - defective phenotypes . Bacterial propagation under cells correlates with toxin injection and is followed by disrup - tion of the cytoskeleton and focal contacts . The toxin effect may be a pre - requisite for bacterial propagation , as the absence of T3SS abolished invasion in the wound assay . Furthermore , bac - teria only penetrated underneath the cells once actin fibers and focal contacts had been abol - ished , which can be easily explained by the need for the bacterium to lift the cell ' s basal membrane in order to progress . Interestingly , the flagellum mutants were only present in small numbers in wounds in the invasion assay , preventing efficient incursion into the basal com - partment , while the other strains accumulated in this location whether or not they invaded the cell layer . The flagellum is thus needed to reach points where invasion opportunities are avail - able . Although access of flagellum - deficient bacteria to the sub - basal compartment was delayed P . aeruginosa Transmigration at Cell - Cell Junctions PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005377 January 4 , 2016 12 / 22 compared to the wild - type strain , once present , cells progressed with comparable speed , dem - onstrating that this motility parameter is independent of the flagellum . This paper also reports the first characterization of P . aeruginosa migration under cell monolayers . In terms of speed and raft formation , the properties of wild - type bacterial migra - tion under cells were similar to what has been described under agar [ 31 ] , except that the lead - ing bacteria migrated individually before assembling into rafts . Importantly , although the role of the flagellum in collective migration currently remains obscure , flagellum - deficient bacteria never formed rafts . It is thus possible that flagella may be required for collective migration under cells . Based on the main data presented in this paper , we propose a model ( Fig 6 ) in which bacte - ria take advantage of either cell division sites or sites of senescent cell extrusion to transmigrate across an epithelial layer . At these specific sites , junctional sealing is imperfect or the basolat - eral membranes are partially exposed allowing toxin injection . Transmigration of the first cell is rapidly followed by massive bacterial infiltration and access to the basal compartment . Once beneath the cell layer , the T3SS toxins induce cell rounding and detachment from the extracel - lular matrix , promoting rapid bacterial propagation below cells , rapidly undermining the epithelium . In conclusion , this paper describes a chronological view of P . aeruginosa transmigration across a model epithelium . The bacteria exploit rare , specific characteristics of the monolayer to breach the barrier at intercellular junctions and to propagate underneath it , employing at least three virulence factors : the T3SS system , pili and the flagellum . Materials and Methods Genetic constructions Replicative pIApX2mCherry plasmid derived from pIApX2 ( 32 ) by replacing the gfp reporter gene fused to constitutive and strong pX2 promoter by mCherry coding sequence . The pX2 - mCherry fusion was subcloned into mini - CTX integrative plasmid leading to mini - CTXpX2mCherry plasmid . P . aeruginosa strains and culture The strains and the plasmids used in this study are described in S1 Table . The bacteria of CHA strain secrete ExoS , T and Y through their T3SS , and exhibit functional pili and flagellum [ 50 – 52 ] . CHA Δ pilY1 and CHA Δ fliC were checked for defective twitching and swimming , respec - tively ( S5 Fig ) and CHA Δ pscF was previously shown to have impaired T3SS toxin secretion [ 52 ] . All strains were transformed with pIAPX2 - mCherry plasmid for fluorescence imaging . Bacteria were grown in liquid LB medium at 37°C with agitation until the cultures reached an optical density value of 1 . 0 to be in the exponential growth phase . Cell culture and infection A549 - EGFP ( Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein ) ( this study ) and MDCK - EGFP ( a gift from René - Marc Mège ) cells were grown in RPMI and DMEM medium , respectively , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( all from Invitrogen ) . For videomicroscopy experiments , cells were seeded at 2 , 500 cells per mm 2 on Labtek II 8 - chambered ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) coverslips and used 72 h later to obtain highly confluent monolayers . Medium was replaced 16 h before infection with fresh medium , and 1 h before infection with fresh non - supplemented medium . Cells were infected at a multiplicty of infection ( MOI ) of 15 ( unless otherwise indicated ) and immediately observed by videomicroscopy .

Model of P . aeruginosa transmigration across epithelial layers . In resting epithelium , T2SS proteases or T3SS toxins are inefficient to disrupt the barrier formed by polarized epithelial cells provided with mature junctions . Bacteria may use cell division or dying cell extrusion to penetrate the epithelium . Once bacteria have access to the baso - lateral domain , they interact with cell membranes using their pili and inject their T3SS toxins , inducing cell retraction and facilitating their invasion of the basal compartment . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005377 . g006 P . aeruginosa Transmigration at Cell - Cell Junctions PLOS Pathogens | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . ppat . 1005377 January 4 , 2016 14 / 22 Cell transfection The plasmid coding for Lifeact - EGFP ( Fig 4A ) was obtained from Roland Wedlich - Soldner . The vinculin - GFP plasmid ( Fig 4B ) was from Hélène Delanoë - Ayari . MDCK cells were trans - fected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamin 2000 ( LifeTechnologies ) 48 h prior to infection . The medium was replaced 24 h before infection with fresh medium . Visualization of bacterial transmigration and cell retraction during infection A549 - EGFP and MDCK - EGFP cells were grown as described above , and were infected by CHA - mCherry . Bacterial transmigration was observed by confocal microscopy for 6 hours , with time points every 15 min . Successive planes in 3D stacks were taken every 0 . 4 μ m . Out - of - focus information in confocal images was removed using the restoration module from Volocity ( PerkinElmer ) . Iterative deconvolution was performed with calculated point spread function . 3D - recontructions of confocal time - lapse were performed using the 3D VTK module from Icy software . For quantitative analysis of bacteria transmigration ( Fig 1C and 1D ) and cell retraction ( Fig 1E and 1F ) , 4 different mCherry transfected - strains were filmed in parallel . For each strain , 10 randomly chosen positions were imaged as above . The infection was filmed for 7 . 5 h , with time points every 15 min . To minimize the acquisition time , only the basal part of the cells was imaged ( 11 z - planes ) . For bacteria counting , only the z - sections where transmigrated bacteria were on focus were used . Images were binarized and bacteria were counted using ImageJ soft - ware . For cell retraction quantification , projections of the 5 lowest z - sections of A549 - EGFP or MDCK - EGFP confocal images were generated . The projections were then binarized and the total cell surfaces were calculated for each image . Quantification of cell division and cell death MDCK - EGFP were grown as described above . One hour prior to experiment , medium was replaced with fresh non - supplemented medium and nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 ( 1 μ g / mL final concentration , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Nuclei and bacteria were filmed every 15 min with a confocal microscope and a 20X air objective . 48 fields were filmed in parallel , at 16 z - planes separated by 1 μ m . Nuclei were counted on the first time point using ImageJ . Transmi - gration sites were scored visually , and classified according to their properties ( i . e . cell division or cell death ) ( Fig 2B ) . Cell divisions and cell deaths were scored visually for the first 3 hours of infection ( Fig 2C ) . Comparison of cell division numbers in infected and non - infected condi - tions was performed in another set of experiment , in which 24 infected fields and 24 non - infected fields were imaged in parallel . Cell division and cell death were scored visually for the first 3 hours of infection ( Fig 2D and 2E ) . Visualization of E - cadherin labeling at transmigration sites MDCK Ecad - GFP were grown as described for MDCK - EGFP . One hour prior to experiment , medium was replaced with fresh non - supplemented medium and nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33342 . Then , cells were infected by CHA - mCherry . Bacterial transmigration was observed by confocal microscopy for 6 hours , with time points every 15 min , at 40 z - planes separated by 0 . 4 μ m .

Briefly , after 3 h of infection with CHA Δ exoS - Sbla - mCherry , cells were washed with PBS containing 2 . 5 mM probenicid , and incubated with freshly prepared CCF2 - AM solution ( 2 μ M final concentration , LiveBLAzer FRET — B / G Loading Kit , Life Technologies ) for 90 min in the dark at room temperature . Then , cells were carefully washed twice with PBS - 2 . 5 mM probenicid . Fluorescence images were acquired with a wide - field microscope as described below . Images of bacteria were also captured , either on the basal ( i . e . transmigrated bacteria ) or on the apical side of MDCK . To distinguish between these two pop - ulations of bacteria in merged images , transmigrated bacteria were given a red artificial color , whereas bacteria on the apical side were colored in yellow ( Fig 3C ) . To determine whether bacteria in basal compartment are located below injected or unin - jected cells , 12 fields exhibiting injected cells were acquired by wide - field microscopy . For each field , the red channel ( bacteria ) was binarized , and the total number of transmigrated bacteria was measured using ImageJ . On the same images , the blue channel ( cleaved CCF2 ) was binar - ized , and a mask corresponding to the zone of injected cells was generated . The number of bac - teria in the mask was calculated . As the CCF2 fluorescence shift is delayed compared to bacterial propagation under cells , the number of bacteria surrounding the blue cells was also measured in the same mask dilated of 15 μ m ( Fig 3D ) . Measurement of bacterial propagation from a wound in the epithelial monolayer Cells were grown as indicated above . One hour prior to infection , the monolayer was scratched with a sterile 10 - μ L pipette tip across the well median . The well was then washed twice with fresh non - supplemented medium . Wounded MDCK - EGFP monolayers were infected with 4 mCherry transfected - strains in parallel ( S4 Fig ) . For each strain , 8 positions were imaged by confocal microscopy . The infec - tion was filmed for 6 hours , with time points every 10 min . Only the basal part of the cells was imaged ( 11 z - planes separated by 0 . 4 μ m ) . The surface occupied by bacteria under MDCK was measured using ImageJ . Briefly , for each time point , a polygon representing the area invaded by bacteria under the cells was manually drawn . Its surface was then measured and compared to the total cell surface minus the wounded area ( Fig 5A ) . Tracking of transmigrated bacteria MDCK - EGFP were infected with CHA - mCherry . After 4 h of infection , early transmigration sites were localized visually on a confocal microscope and bacteria propagation from these sites was filmed for 1 . 5 h every 30 s ( S8 and S9 Movies ) . Tracking of bacteria at the propagation leading edge was performed using the MTrackJ plugin of ImageJ . The instantaneous velocities were measured ( Fig 5B and 5C ) . Only tracks of more than 20 μ m were considered . Confocal microscopy For fluorescence time - lapse microscopy , cells were imaged using a confocal spinning - disk inverted microscope ( Nikon TI - E Eclipse ) equipped with an Evolve EMCCD camera . The opti - cal sectioning was performed by a Yokogawa motorized confocal head CSUX1 - A1 .
