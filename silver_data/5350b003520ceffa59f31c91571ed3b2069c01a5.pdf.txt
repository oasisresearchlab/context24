Major targets of cancer - causing HPV E7 proteins are the pRB family of tumor suppressors , which E7 targets for proteasome - mediated degradation and whose interaction is promoted through an acidic patch , downstream of the LXCXE motif in E7 , that is subject to phosphorylation by casein kinase II ( CKII ) . In this study we show that HPV - 16 E7 targets the AP2 - complex , which plays a critical role in cargo recognition in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Intriguingly , HPV - 16 E7 contains a speci ﬁ c amino acid sequence for AP2 recognition , and this overlaps the pRb LXCXE recognition sequence but involves completely different amino acid residues . HPV - 16 E7 does this by binding to the AP2 - m 2 adaptor protein subunit via residues 25 - YEQL - 28 within the LXCXE motif . Point mutations at Y25 within 22 - LYCYE - 26 suggest that the interaction of E7 with AP2 - m 2 is independent from pRB binding . In cells , this interaction is modulated by acidic residues downstream of LXCXE , with the binding being facilitated by CKII - phos - phorylation of the serines at positions 31 and 32 . Finally , we also show that associa - tion of HPV - 16 E7 with the AP2 adaptor complex can contribute to cellular transforma - tion under low - nutrient conditions , which appears to be mediated , in part , through inhibition of AP2 - mediated internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . This indicates that E7 can modulate endocytic transport pathways , with one such com - ponent , EGFR , most likely contributing toward the ability of E7 to induce cell transfor - mation and malignancy . These studies de ﬁ ne a new and unexpected role for HPV - 16 E7 in targeting clathrin - mediated endocytosis . IMPORTANCE Despite being a very small protein , HPV - E7 has a wide range of func - tions within the infected cell , many of which can lead to cell transformation . High - risk HPV - E7 deregulates the function of many cellular proteins , perturbing cellular homeostasis . We show that a novel target of HPV - E7 is the clathrin - adaptor protein 2 complex ( AP2 ) m 2 subunit , interacting via residues within E7 ’ s pRB - binding region . Mutational studies show that an AP2 recognition motif is present in the CR2 region and is conserved in . 50 HPV types , suggesting a common function for this motif in HPV biology . Mutational analysis suggests that this motif is important for cellular transformation , potentially modulating endocytosis of growth factor receptors such as EGFR , and thus being a novel activity of E7 in modulating clathrin - mediated endocytosis and cargo selection . This study has important implications for the mo - lecular basis of E7 function in modulating protein traf ﬁ cking at the cell surface .

Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women aged 15 to 44 and is almost always associated with infection by high - risk HPVs ( 2 ) . More recently , there has been a signi ﬁ cant rise in oropharyngeal cancers associated with HPV infection ( 3 ) . Currently , effective prophylactic vaccines are available against several of the high - risk HPV types ( reviewed in reference 4 ) ; however , the dif ﬁ culties linked to the cost and logistics of these vaccines in developing countries — where most of these infections occur — remain the biggest challenges in ﬁ ghting the cancers associated with these viruses . In addition , as the vaccine has no therapeutic effect ; those already infected are at risk of developing cancers later in life , suggesting the urgent need for , and importance of , therapeutic agents ( reviewed in references 5 and 6 ) . HPV infections are , in general , cleared by the host immune system ; however , in some individuals a persistent infection develops , which , together with a perturbed immune clearance , marks the highest risk factor for the development of cancer . 10 to 20 years later ( 7 , 8 ) . The major hallmark of HPV - associated cancers is the high and con - tinued expression of the HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 , which contribute to the devel - opment of these malignancies by targeting several host cellular processes ( reviewed in reference 9 ) . Mainly , the E7 oncoprotein binds the pocket proteins ( pRB , p130 , and p107 ) , allowing E2F transcription - induced cell cycle reentry in already differentiated ke - ratinocytes , while the HPV E6 oncoprotein , by targeting the tumor suppressor p53 for degradation , circumvents the consequent cellular apoptosis . While both these onco - proteins are known to play signi ﬁ cant roles in the development and maintenance of cancer , much remains to be clari ﬁ ed in de ﬁ ning the mechanisms behind their roles in malignant transformation ( reviewed in reference 10 ) . HPV oncoproteins are very plastic in their ability to interact with many host proteins and modulate their functions ( reviewed in references 11 – 13 ) . A proteomic screen ( 14 ) using dif - ferent HPV types showed that HPV E7 interacts with several proteins involved in membrane protein traf ﬁ cking , suggesting that it could affect the endocytic machinery of the cell ( Fig . 1A ) . Endocytosis is the process of selective packaging and traf ﬁ cking of membrane pro - teins into endosomes in the cell interior , a process that is mainly mediated by clathrin and adaptor proteins ( AP ) ( 15 , 16 ) . Several steps in vesicular traf ﬁ cking that are important for exchange of proteins and lipids between intracellular membrane compartments ( plasma membrane , endosomes , and the trans - Golgi network ) use clathrin / clathrin adaptor coats ( 17 ) . Protein sorting within these membrane compartments mostly relies on short linear peptide sequences ( sorting signals ) in the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins , which are recognized by adaptor proteins . These sorting signals include YXX w ( where w is a hydrophobic residue ) , [ D / E ] XXXL [ L / I ] , FXNPXY , DXXLL , and the acidic cluster motif ( phospho - serines ﬂ anked by acidic residues , often seen adjacent to dileucine motifs ) . Clathrin adaptor complexes ( AP1 to 3 ) are heterotetramers composed of large subunits ( g 1 , g 2 / a A , a C / d and b 1 / b 2 / b 3A , b 3B ) , a medium subunit ( m 1A , m 1B / m 2 / m 3A , m 3B ) , and a small subunit ( s 1A , s 1B , s 1C / s 2 / s 3A , s 3B ) with corresponding gene names designated AP1G1 - 2 / AP2A1 - 2 / AP3D1 and AP1B1 / AP2B1 / AP3B1 - 2 for the large subunits , AP1M1 - 2 / AP2M1 / AP3M1 - 2 for the medium subunit , and AP2S1 - 3 / AP2S1 / AP3S1 - 2 for the small subunit . Tyrosine - based motifs bind to the m subunits , while leucine - based motifs bind to the s and g / a subunits ( 18 , 19 ) . The AP2 adaptor complex is mainly involved in the endocytic process , and many cellular proteins contain these endocytic motifs , allowing them to be recognized by the AP2 com - plex and endocytosed to the endosomes . Intriguingly , a closer look at HPV - 16 E7 shows that it contains a YXX w endocytic motif , partly overlapping the LXCXE motif . This is followed by an acidic cluster motif at the casein kinase II ( CKII ) phosphorylation site , typical of the classi - cal cytoplasmic tail of furin , which mediates trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) localization and endocytosis at the plasma membrane ( 20 , 21 ) . In this study we therefore asked whether , via this motif , HPV - 16 E7 is able to cross talk with the endocytic machinery of the cell . RESULTS HPV - 16 E7 associates with the AP2 adaptor protein complex . Early studies of the N - terminal regions of HPV - 16 E7 found sequence similarities to some regions of the HPV - 16 E7 Interacts with AP2 - m 2 Subunit mBio November / December 2022 Volume 13 Issue 6 10 . 1128 / mbio . 02302 - 22 2 adenovirus ( Ad ) E1a protein and the simian vacuolating virus 40 large tumor antigen ( SV40T ) , suggesting that similar mechanisms of action of these viral proteins might be essential for cellular transformation ( 22 ) . Later , the LXCXE sequence motif in the con - served region 2 ( CR2 ) of HPV - 16 E7 was shown to interact with the retinoblastoma tu - mor suppressor gene product pRB ( 23 ) , similarly to Ad E1a ( 24 ) and SV40T ( 25 ) , using similar transactivation and transformation functions ( 22 , 26 , 27 ) . It is now well estab - lished that the CR2 region of HPV - 16 E7 is required to modulate many host cell regula - tory proteins that are important for the viral life cycle , for cellular transformation , and for maintenance of the transformed phenotype of tumor cells ( 28 – 31 ) . Interestingly , the LXCXE sequences in the HPV - 16 E7 CR2 ( Fig . 1B and 2A ) partly overlap the endo - cytic motif ( YXX w , where X is any amino acid and w is a hydrophobic residue ) , which is FIG 1 HPV - 16 E7 associates with the AP2 adaptor protein complex m 2 subunit .

A proteomic screen also identi - ﬁ ed several of these endocytic adaptor protein complex AP2 subunits ( Fig . 1C ) as potential binding partners of HPV E7 ( Fig . 1A ) ( 14 ) .

HPV - 16 E7 Interacts with AP2 - m 2 Subunit mBio November / December 2022 Volume 13 Issue 6 10 . 1128 / mbio . 02302 - 22 4 assay , in which [ 35 ] - S - labeled AP2 - m 2 was incubated with puri ﬁ ed HPV - 16 E7 GST fusion protein , and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . HPV - 16 E7 does , indeed , bind to the AP2 - m 2 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 ( AP2 ) ( Fig . 1D ) . Furthermore , when puri ﬁ ed C - terminally , His - tagged HPV - 16 E7 was incubated with puri ﬁ ed GST AP2 core and analyzed by GST pulldown assay , we could pull down HPV - 16 E7 , suggesting that there is a direct interaction between HPV - 16 E7 and the AP2 adaptor complex , potentially via the AP2 - m 2 subunit ( Fig . 1E ) . We could also see that such an interaction occurs in vivo , by overexpressing C - ter - minally FLAG - tagged HPV - 16 E7 and HA - tagged AP2M1 in HEK 293 cells ; after 24 h the AP2 adaptor protein complex subunits can be coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG - tagged HPV - 16 E7 using anti - FLAG agarose beads and , reciprocally , HPV - 16 E7 can be coimmunoprecipitated with AP2 - m 2 using anti - HA agarose beads ( Fig . 1F ) . We then extended this analysis to cells endogenously expressing E7 by performing coimmuno - precipitation assays in SiHa and CaSki cells using antibodies against HPV - 16 E7 , and we showed that the AP2 adaptor protein complex subunits are immunoprecipitated with HPV - 16 E7 , and a reciprocal immunoprecipitation of HPV - 16 E7 is seen using antibodies against AP2 - m 2 or AP2 a subunits ( Fig . 1G ) , suggesting that HPV - 16 E7 is a bona ﬁ de interacting partner of the AP2 adaptor protein complex and that it associates poten - tially via a tyrosine - based endocytic motif in its CR2 region . HPV - 16 E7 interacts with the AP2 - l 2 subunit via 25 - YEQL - 28 and the CKII phos - pho - acceptor site at S31 / S32 . The HPV - 16 E7 residues responsible for binding to the AP2 complex , 25 - YEQL - 28 , appear to partly overlap the LXCXE pRB binding motif ( Fig . 2A ) . To further map this site , several CR2 region mutants of HPV - 16 E7 were gener - ated , and these were analyzed by coexpressing them with HA - tagged AP2 - m 2 in HEK 293 cells , followed by immunoprecipitation using FLAG agarose beads and Western blotting , as before . We can see from Fig . 2B that the mutations Y25A , Y25H , L28A , and Y23L / Y25H , in the putative YXX w endocytic motif of the E7 CR2 , severely compromise the ability of HPV - 16 E7 to bind AP2 - m 2 , suggesting that these residues are critically important for E7 ’ s interaction with the AP2 - m 2 subunit . Furthermore , when a double al - anine ( S31A / S32A ) mutant of HPV - 16 E7 is used , there is a decrease in interaction , while a phosphomimic ( S31E / S32E ) mutant interacts with AP2 - m 2 as ef ﬁ ciently as wild - type HPV - 16 E7 ( Fig . 2B , lane 2 compared with lanes 8 and 9 ) , suggesting that phos - phorylation of E7 might play a role in this association . We also validated this interaction using normal immortal keratinocytes ( NIKS ) stable cell lines expressing either empty vector , HPV - 16 E7 wild type , or the HPV - 16 E7 Y25A mutant to perform coimmunopre - cipitation assays with AP2 - m 2 antibody ( Fig . 2C ) . Since these residues partly overlap the LXCXE pRB binding region , we asked if they might also affect the ability of E7 to interact with pRB . Using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting assays , as before , we found that mutating the Y25 residue to histidine or alanine has minimal effects upon pRB binding ( Fig . 2D ) . Furthermore , when we probed for pRB in reciprocal coim - munoprecipitation as before in HEK 293 cells overexpressing HA - AP2M1 and C - termi - nally FLAG - tagged HPV - 16 E7 , we could see that pRB immunoprecipitates with E7 but not with AP2 - m 2 ( Fig . 2E ) , suggesting that E7 ’ s AP2 - binding and pRB - binding activities are separable and , potentially , have evolved to execute diverse biological functions . The L28A mutation , however , seems to severely abrogate the ability of E7 to interact with pRB , suggesting that a conserved Leucine residue beyond the LXCXE motif might have a critical role in interacting with RB ( Fig . 2D ) . We then proceeded to analyze the sequences of multiple HPV - E7s for the presence of an endocytic motif ( Yxx w ) in their CR1 or CR2 domains . Interestingly , we found it to be present in the E7 of 54 different HPV types : three Mu HPVs ( HPV - 1 , - 63 , and - 204 ) , seven - teen beta HPVs ( HPV - 9 , - 15 , - 17 , - 37 , - 49 , - 75 , - 76 , - 80 , - 104 , - 107 , - 110 , - 111 , - 113 , - 122 , - 159 , - 182 , - 209 ) , and thirty - four alpha HPVs , of which ten ( HPV - 16 , - 31 , - 33 , - 35 , - 39 , - 45 , - 51 , - 52 , - 58 , and - 59 ) are classi ﬁ ed as group 1 , cancer - causing high - risk types ; eleven ( HPV - 26 - 30 , - 34 , - 67 , - 68 , - 69 , - 70 , - 73 , - 82 , - 85 , and - 97 ) are group 2 , probable / possible high - risk types , and nine ( HPV - 6 , - 11 , - 13 , - 28 , - 32 , - 42 , - 44 , - 74 , and - 81 ) are group 3 , HPV - 16 E7 Interacts with AP2 - m 2 Subunit mBio November / December 2022 Volume 13 Issue 6 10 . 1128 / mbio . 02302 - 22 5 low - risk types ( refer to Fig . 3 for an alignment of all 54 motif - containing HPV E7s ) , which suggests a broadly conserved function for this site in HPV biology . Interestingly , although most high - risk HPV types have this motif , the HPV - 18 E7 has a histidine instead of the consensus Y25 at the putative endocytic motif site ( Fig . 2A ) ; we questioned whether this residue would prevent interaction with the AP2 complex , as occurred with HPV - 16 E7 when the Y25 residue was mutated ( Fig . 2B ) . We overexpressed the C - terminally FLAG / HA - tagged HPV - 16 , - 18 , or - 11 E7s and HA - AP2 - m 2 in HEK 293 cells and performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay , as before . In Fig . 2F it can be seen that HPV - 18 E7 has a dramatically decreased ability to bind AP2 - m 2 compared with HPV - 16 and HPV - 11 E7s . Furthermore , we saw similar differential binding between AP2 - m 2 and E7s in the case of NIKS stable lines expressing either empty vector , HPV - 16 E7 , - 18 E7 , or - 11 E7 , using coimmunoprecipitation as before , depending on the presence of the tyrosine residue in the Yxx w motif ( Fig . 2G ) . We generated further mutants : HPV - 18 E7 H28Y and HPV - 18 L26Y / H28Y ( as an HPV - 16 “ look - alike ” in the LXCXE and Yxx w regions ) to generate a Yxx w motif , and analyzed their ability to interact with AP2 - m 2 using HEK 293 overexpression and coimmunoprecipitation as before . As can be seen in Fig . 2H , swapping a tyrosine residue at 28 for histidine in HPV - 18 E7 allows it to interact with AP2 - m 2 , suggesting that there is a critical requirement for tyrosine at this position , as is true for a typical endocytic motif in cargoes of AP2 - m 2 ( 19 , 32 ) . Hydrophobic pockets and basic residues in AP2 - l 2 are important for interac - tion with HPV - 16 - E7 in a phosphorylation - dependent manner . It has been previ - ously shown that Yxx w motif - containing cargoes interact with the hydrophobic pocket residues F174 , D176 , W421 , V422 , and R423 of the AP2 - m 2 subunit ( 19 ) ( Fig . 4A and B ) . We therefore asked whether this hydrophobic pocket in AP2 - m 2 is responsible for FIG 3 Alignment of E7 proteins from HPV types with a potential AP2 - m 2 binding site , showing the YXX U motif in the CR2 region ( boxed ) , grouped based on risk types .

HPV - 16 E7 Interacts with AP2 - m 2 Subunit mBio November / December 2022 Volume 13 Issue 6 10 . 1128 / mbio . 02302 - 22 7 interacting with HPV - 16 E7 . Indeed , in a coimmunoprecipitation assay using HEK 293 cells overexpressing either HA - AP2M1 wild - type or the D176A mutant , together with HPV - 16 E7 , we saw that mutation in the tyrosine binding pocket ( D176A ) in AP2 - m 2 also perturbs the interaction with HPV - 16 E7 ( Fig . 4C ) . Furthermore , basic residues in AP2 - m 2 ( Fig . 4B ) have also been shown to interact with the phosphoserine acidic cluster motif ( PSAC ) ( 20 ) , and there is an acidic patch just downstream of the LXCXE motif in the E7 CR2 ( Fig . 2A ) , where the serine residues of several high - and low - risk E7s are phosphorylated by casein kinase II , albeit with dif - fering kinetics ( 33 – 35 ) . This is similar to the acidic patch found in HIV - 1 Nef protein that is important for interaction via the dileucine - based motif ( 36 , 37 ) . To investigate whether such an acidic patch could contribute to binding the AP2 - m 2 subunit , we performed a preliminary biotinylated peptide pulldown using a phos - pho - peptide corresponding to the CR2 region of the HPV - 16 E7 N29S variant . We found that this phospho - peptide pulled down more AP2 a subunit from HaCaT cell extract than the nonphosphorylated peptide ( Fig . 4D ) . Furthermore , in pulldown assays using puri ﬁ ed GST fusion proteins of HPV - 16 E7 and phospho - HPV - 16 E7 incubated with HaCaT cell lysate , we saw an enhanced interaction of AP2 - m 2 with phospho - HPV - 16 E7 compared with non - phospho - HPV - 16 E7 ( Fig . 4E ) . We extended these analyses using puri ﬁ ed AP2 hemicomplexes or AP2 core , incubating them with HEK 293 cell extracts overexpressed with HPV - 16 E7 wild type or S31A / S32A mutant , and then per - forming either GST or Ni - nitrilotriacetic acid ( Ni - NTA ) agarose pulldowns . As seen in Fig . 4F , the nonphosphorylable S31A / S32A mutant of HPV - 16 E7 weakly associates with AP2 core or AP2 - b 2 - m 2 hemicomplex , while phosphorylable HPV - 16 E7 wild type binds strongly to both AP2 core and AP2 - b 2 - m 2 hemicomplex . It is also noteworthy that E7 ’ s association with AP2 - a 2 - s 2 hemicomplex is undetectable , compared with its association with AP2 - b 2 - m 2 hemicomplex , which suggests that the m 2 subunit is chie ﬂ y responsible for this interaction , with the acidic cluster contributing through an avidity effect . To analyze the role of the basic residues of AP2 - m 2 in this interaction in vivo , we used one of the several basic patch mutants in AP2 - m 2 , K308E K312E ( 20 ) , and per - formed immunoprecipitation assays as before . In Fig . 4C and G we show that the dou - ble mutant K308E K312E also disrupts the association with HPV - 16 E7 , albeit to a lesser degree . Furthermore , when the HPV - 16 E7 CKII phosphorylation site mutant ( S31A S32A ) and the AP2 - m 2 basic patch mutant ( K308E K312E ) are overexpressed in HEK293 cells , co - immunoprecipitation assays show that the interaction between AP2 - m 2 K308E K312E and HPV - 16 E7 S31A S32A is compromised , compared with the interaction between the wild - type counterparts ( Fig . 4G ) . This suggests that , in addition to a bona ﬁ de Yxx w motif , phospho - serine residues in the acidic patch are important for E7 ’ s interaction with basic residues in AP2 - m 2 , and in cells this might be chie ﬂ y modulated by CKII phosphorylation of E7 . Is interaction of HPV - 16 E7 with AP2 complex important for BRK cell transfor - mation ? The overlap between E7 ’ s pocket - protein interaction region and residues respon - sible for binding the AP2 complex was intriguing and led us to ask if the AP2 - HPV - 16 E7 interaction has any role in cellular transformation . To examine this , we performed baby rat kidney ( BRK ) cell transformation assays , as described previously ( 27 ) . As shown in Fig . 5A , the pRB binding - defective mutant , HPV - 16 E7 C24G , has a dramatically reduced ability to transform cells compared with the wild - type HPV - 16 E7 , as described before ( 38 , 39 ) . However , AP2 - m 2 binding - defective mutants ( Y25A , Y25H , and CKII mutants ) showed simi - lar transforming ability as the wild - type E7 ( blue bars ) , although when AP2 - m 2 was coex - pressed , wild - type HPV - 16 E7 gave rise to more transformed colonies ( difference not sig - ni ﬁ cant at 95 % con ﬁ dence interval [ CI ] ) than HPV - 16 E7 alone ; and when we used AP2 - m 2 binding - defective mutants of E7 ( Y25A , Y25H , or CKII mutant ) , coexpression of AP2 - m 2 largely abolished the ability of these mutants to bring about cell transformation ( pink bars ) , suggesting that HPV - 16 E7 ’ s interaction with AP2 can potentially augment its trans - forming ability in BRK cells . In addition , we see a signi ﬁ cant increase in the number of transformed colonies HPV - 16 E7 Interacts with AP2 - m 2 Subunit mBio November / December 2022 Volume 13 Issue 6 10 . 1128 / mbio . 02302 - 22 8 induced by the H28Y mutant compared with wild - type HPV - 18 E7 ( Fig . 5B ) alone or coexpressed with AP2 - m 2 , emphasizing the importance of E7 ’ s Yxx w motif and its interaction with AP2 - m 2 in cell transformation . These results indicate that , for optimal transforming activity , E7 must target the AP2 complex and that increased levels of AP2 can actually enhance E7 ’ s transforming activity . However , where E7 is unable to target AP2 , overexpression has a strong tumor - suppressive potential . HPV - 16 E7 is a major transforming protein and shows transforming potential even under low - growth factor conditions ( 28 ) . To further delineate the role of this motif in FIG 5 Residues in HPV - 16 E7 responsible for binding the AP2 complex are important for BRK cell transformation .

As shown in Fig . 5C , the wild - type HPV - 16 E7 can very ef ﬁ ciently transform BRK cells as before ; however , the AP2 - m 2 - binding - defective mutants ( Y25A , Y25H , or CKII mutant ) have signi ﬁ cantly reduced ability to transform these cells , con - ﬁ rming that there is a critical requirement for this motif , and potentially for interacting with AP2 - m 2 , for ef ﬁ cient transformation by HPV - 16 E7 , particularly under low - nutrient conditions . Does interaction of HPV - 16 E7 with AP2 - l 2 affect endocytic cargoes ? The in - triguing results from the interaction and BRK transformation assays led us to wonder whether E7 might affect the endocytic cargoes traf ﬁ cked into endosomes by interacting with the AP2 endocytic complex and potentially affecting signaling receptors , such as ty - rosine kinase receptors ( Fig . 6A ) . To study this , we chose the epidermal growth factor re - ceptor ( EGFR ) , which interacts with AP2 - m 2 via the EGFR tyrosine residue 974 ( 19 , 40 ) , and this is important for its internalization upon activation ( 41 , 42 ) . To analyze whether expression of E7 could perturb the AP2 - m 2 - EGFR interaction , we performed coimmuno - precipitation analyses of HEK 293 cells overexpressing myc - His - tagged EGFR wild - type ( WT ) and HA - AP2 - m 2 WT , together with either FLAG - tagged HPV - 16 E7 WT or Y25A mu - tant . We also included HPV - 11 E7 wild type and Y26A mutant and HPV - 18 E7 wild type in this assay . HA - AP2 - m 2 was precipitated using anti - HA - agarose beads , and coprecipi - tated proteins were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting . As seen in Fig . 6B , we could reproduce the results of previous studies where EGFR clearly precipitates with wild - type AP2 - m 2 but not with a D176A mutant of the AP2 - m 2 tyrosine binding motif . Strikingly , coimmunoprecipitation of EGFR with wild - type AP2 - m 2 is abrogated in cells expressing wild - type HPV - 16 E7 but is regained in cells expressing the HPV - 16 E7 Y25A mutant , suggesting that E7 may occupy a cargo binding motif in AP2 - m 2 , possibly hin - dering the endocytic internalization of receptor proteins such as EGFR . We also saw simi - lar perturbation of the AP2 - m 2 / EGFR interaction in cells expressing wild - type HPV - 11 E7 , which is rescued in cells expressing the 11 E7 Y26A mutants defective in binding to AP2 - m 2 . In cells expressing HPV - 18 E7 , defective in binding with AP2 - m 2 , the interaction with EGFR is preserved . Taken together , these results suggest that HPV - E7s with the tyrosine motif competitively occupy the cargo - binding motif of AP2 , potentially modulating EGFR endocytosis . AP2 - dependent internalization of EGFR is one of the main means of regulating EGFR endocytosis ( 43 ) . Given that HPV - 16 E7 would competitively occupy the cargo binding motif of AP2 - m 2 , it would potentially delay EGFR internalization , leading to sustained activation of EGFR upon EGF stimulation , which also suggests that HPV - 16 E7 - expressing cells would have higher total levels of EGFR on the cell surface than wild - type cells ( Fig . 6A ) . To analyze this , we used stable NIKS cell lines expressing either empty vector , HPV - 16 E7 wild - type , or the HPV - 16 E7 Y25A mutant . These NIKS cell lines were then analyzed for time - dependent EGFR activation ( phosphorylation of Y1068 ) upon EGF stimulation after overnight serum starvation , using SDS - PAGE and Western blotting of whole - cell lysates . As seen in Fig . 6C , all three NIKS cell lines showed profound activation of EGFR ( phospho - Y1068 ) as soon as 1 min after EGF treat - ment ; however , this activation was only sustained in NIKS lines expressing wild - type HPV - 16 E7 . Furthermore , phospho - extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) , a downstream target of EGFR activation , follows the same sustained activation pattern as EGFR activation ( Fig . 6C ) . We also analyzed the levels of phospho - EGFR in the mem - brane fractions of the NIKS stable lines at 1 and 60 min post - EGF treatment after overnight starvation ( Fig . 6D ) and saw that phospho - EGFR is more highly retained in NIKS - 16 E7 wild type than in NIKS - 16 E7 Y25A . We also saw a similar downregulation of surface EGFR in the membrane fraction of HPV - 18 E7 NIKS stable cells upon EGF chase between 1 and 60 min , suggesting that activated EGFR is sustained in the membrane in E7 - expressing cells only where E7 sequestrates the AP2 - m 2 cargo binding motif , potentially delaying clathrin - AP2 - dependent EGFR endocytosis .

The results in Fig . 6E and F , show that HPV - 16 E7 - expressing CaSki cells sustain EGFR activation upon EGF treatment , leading to the concomitant activation of phospho - ERK1 / 2 , whereas HPV - 18 E7 - expressing HeLa FIG 6 EGFR signaling is sustained in cells expressing E7 with the AP2 binding motif . ( A ) Cartoon showing normal cells and cells expressing HPV - 16 E7 upon EGF stimulation . Normal cells activate EGFR , relaying the signal downstream to the ERK pathway , and ﬁ nally , leading to growth and proliferation . Activated EGFR is endocytosed through the AP2 complex , leading to degradation or recycling of the receptor . In cells expressing HPV - 16 E7 , however , endocytosis is probably delayed due to sequestration of AP2 by E7 occupying the cargo binding motif , allowing sustained EGFR - ERK signaling . ( B ) Perturbation of AP2 interaction with EGFR in wild - type and mutant E7 - expressing cells shown by coimmunoprecipitation assay . Cell lysates from HEK 293 cells cotransfected with myc - His6 - tagged EGFR WT , HA - AP2 - m 2 WT or D176A mutant , HPV - 16 E7 WT or Y25A mutant , HPV - 11 E7 WT or Y26A mutant , or HPV - 18 E7 WT as indicated , were used to coimmunoprecipitate EGFR and E7s using anti - HA agarose beads to concentrate AP2 - m 2 . Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting for bound EGFR , and E7s , and AP2 subunits as shown .

Furthermore , the levels of phospho - EGFR in membrane fractions of CaSki cells are higher after 1 h , compared with after 1 min of EGF treatment , while in similarly treated HeLa cells , there are lower levels of phospho - EGFR in the membrane fraction after 1 h compared with 1 min , suggesting that competitive binding of E7 to AP2 - m 2 leads to sustained EGFR activation and enhanced EGFR - ERK signaling in HPV - 16 - positive CaSki cells , while this does not occur in HeLa cells , further highlighting impor - tant differences in the mechanisms of action of HPV - 16 and HPV - 18 E7 oncoproteins . DISCUSSION In this study we have identi ﬁ ed a novel biochemical activity , common to the E7 on - coproteins from many HPV types and residing within the LXCXE pRb binding domain , that confers association with components of the AP2 complex and thus affects the reg - ulation of clathrin - mediated endocytic cargo transport . Biologically , this appears to play a major role in the ability of E7 to bring about cell transformation and , in the ab - sence of such an activity of E7 , the AP2 complex can act as a potent tumor suppressor . Previous proteomic studies had indicated the potential for E7 to interact with compo - nents of the clathrin endocytic transport complex ( 14 ) . Further analysis of the HPV - 16 E7 sequence identi ﬁ ed a perfect consensus for AP2 - m 2 recognition between residues 25 - YEQL - 28 , upstream of the acidic patch that de ﬁ nes the CKII recognition motif . Such AP2 - m 2 recognition motifs have also been reported to be important for AP2 - m 2 recognition in a number of cargoes , including furin ( 21 , 44 , 45 ) . This potential AP2 - m 2 recognition sequence is present in E7 proteins from both high - and low - risk HPV types , suggesting that it is not uniquely linked with E7 transforming activity but re ﬂ ects a major conserved function , spanning multiple HPV types . Intriguingly , the AP2 - m 2 consensus site is partly embedded within the LXCXE pRb recognition motif , again highlighting the incredible functional diversity within these small DNA tumor virus oncoproteins . Using puri ﬁ ed components in vitro , we ﬁ rst showed that HPV - 16 E7 can interact directly with AP2 - m 2 and , using mutational analysis , we ﬁ nely mapped the residues within E7 and AP2 - m 2 required for this association . This analysis also allowed us to pre - cisely separate E7 ’ s pRb binding activity from its ability to interact with AP2 - m 2 . Intriguingly , HPV - 18 E7 lacks the consensus recognition sequence for AP2 - m 2 , but mutation of a single amino acid at residue 28 makes HPV - 18 E7 look like HPV - 16 E7 , and the ability to interact with AP2 - m 2 is conferred . Most importantly , we were able to show , in cells derived from cervical cancers , that HPV - 16 E7 can interact strongly with the AP2 complex , indicating that the interaction does , indeed , occur in vivo and , fur - thermore , that phosphorylation of E7 by CKII enhances its association with AP2 - m 2 , as has been observed for other classical cargoes of the AP2 complex ( 21 , 44 , 45 ) . This raises the important question of how E7 might target pRb and AP2M1 within the same cell . However , E7 is not solely a nuclear protein , and we favor the hypothesis that the LXCXE motif confers pRb association within the nuclear pool , while the cytoplasmic pool of E7 targets the AP2 complex through the overlapping 25 - YEQL - 28 motif . At present we have no evidence to suggest that E7 modulates the level of AP2 - m 2 protein expression ; rather , it would appear that E7 simply occupies the cargo - interact - ing motif of the complex , potentially competing for cargo recognition during endocy - tosis . Indeed , we present compelling evidence that in the case of EGFR , E7 contributes to maintaining EGFR signaling by delaying its recognition by the AP2 complex , thereby maintaining its surface expression and growth - promoting signaling . A major future goal will be to more fully understand the landscape of cellular proteins whose clathrin - AP2 - dependent transport is modulated by the HPV E7 oncoproteins . In the current article we show that the interaction of high - risk E7 with AP2 contrib - utes to transforming ability potentially through EGFR signaling . However , the E7 / AP2 interaction is also conserved among many low - risk E7 proteins , indicating that support of transforming activity in high - risk types is subordinate to a more general activity linked to the successful completion of the viral life cycle . Indeed , enhancement of HPV - 16 E7 Interacts with AP2 - m 2 Subunit mBio November / December 2022 Volume 13 Issue 6 10 . 1128 / mbio . 02302 - 22 12 proliferative signaling through EGFR may be one such mechanism , but further studies are required to gain a fuller understanding of the global effects of E7 upon AP2 - medi - ated cargo transport . It is also interesting to note that the E7 / AP2 interaction is enhanced by CKII phosphorylation of E7 , where high - risk types are substantially better substrates than the low - risk types ( 35 ) , which also most likely contributes to differences between the different viruses with respect to the biological consequences of the AP2 interaction . As noted above , the AP2 - m 2 recognition motif is found in both high - and low - risk E7 oncoproteins ; hence , it is not unique to transforming HPV types . However , AP2 - m 2 recognition appears to have an important role to play in the ability of HPV - 16 E7 to induce cell transformation . Clearly , loss of AP2 - m 2 binding results in a modest reduc - tion of cell transforming activity , albeit not to the same extent as loss of pRb recogni - tion ; however , restoration of AP2 - m 2 recognition in HPV - 18 E7 clearly augments its ability to bring about cell transformation . However , when transformation assays were performed under reduced growth factor conditions ( 3 % serum medium ) , the ability to transform cells is severely compromised for E7 mutants that cannot interact with AP2 - m 2 , while wild - type E7 can transform cells almost as well as under regular growth fac - tor conditions . This result again highlights the potential importance of this interaction in conferring enhanced proliferative potential under conditions of low nutrients . This also re ﬂ ects nicely the previous studies also showing the that CKII phosphorylation of E7 plays an important role in maintaining proliferation in low - nutrient conditions ( 28 ) , and it is tempting to speculate that the activities are connected through CKII regula - tion of interaction with both pRB and AP2 , subsequently maintaining growth factor signaling such as that shown here for EGFR . Taken together , these results de ﬁ ne a new and unexpected mechanism by which E7 can modulate clathrin - mediated endocytosis and cargo selection . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells .

The following antibodies were used for Western blotting : mouse monoclonal anti - a - tubulin , mouse monoclonal anti - HA - peroxidase ( clone HA - 7 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - FLAG - M2 - peroxidase from Sigma , 6 (cid:1) - His Tag antibody ( MA1 - 21315 ) from Thermo Fisher , mouse monoclonal anti - HPV - 18 E7 antibody ( F - 7 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - HPV - 16 E7 antibody ( NM2 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - GFP antibody ( B - 2 ) , mouse monoclonal EGFR antibody ( A - 10 ) ( sc - 373746 ) , mouse monoclonal b - adaptin ( A - 5 ) ( sc - 74423 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - ERK1 / 2 antibody ( C - 9 ) ( sc - 514302 ) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , mouse monoclonal anti - Rb ( G3 - 245 ) , puri ﬁ ed mouse anti - adaptin a ( 610502 ) , puri ﬁ ed mouse anti - AP50 ( 611350 ) from BD Pharmingen , rabbit anti - phospho - EGF receptor ( Tyr1068 ) ( D7A5 ) ( monoclonal antibody [ MAb ] no . 3777 ) , rabbit anti - phospho - p44 / 42 mitogen - activated pro - tein kinase ( MAPK ) ( Erk1 / 2 ) ( Thr202 / Tyr204 ) ( D13 . 14 . 4E ) ( MAb no . 4370 ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - Rb antibody ( D20 ) ( MAb no . 9313 ) from Cell Signaling , goat polyclonal anti - HA tag antibody ( ab215069 ) , and rabbit monoclonal anti - AP2M1 antibody ( EP2695Y ) from Abcam . HPV - 16 E7 pS31 / S32 peptide antibodies have been described before ( 28 ) . Secondary anti - rabbit horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) , anti - goat HRP , and anti - mouse HRP antibodies were obtained from Dako . For Western blotting , total cell extracts were obtained by lysing the cells directly in 2 (cid:1) SDS - PAGE sample buffer and were then separated by SDS - PAGE and blotted on a 0 . 22 - m m nitrocellulose mem - brane . Membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat dry milk in TBST ( 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ) for 1 h and probed with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies . The blots HPV - 16 E7 Interacts with AP2 - m 2 Subunit mBio November / December 2022 Volume 13 Issue 6 10 . 1128 / mbio . 02302 - 22 14 were then developed using the ECL Western blotting detection reagent ( GE Healthcare ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . For coimmunoprecipitation , cells were harvested using lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , 1 mM NaF , protease inhibitor cocktail I [ Calbiochem ] ) and centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 15 min . Cell lysates for over - expressed proteins were incubated with FLAG - or HA - agarose beads as indicated for 4 h at 4°C followed by washing times with the lysis buffer . For coimmunoprecipitation using endogenous proteins , cell lysates were incubated with 1 to 2 m g of the indicated antibody overnight at 4°C . After incubation , immune complexes were incubated further with protein A or G beads ( immobilized protein A 300 [ Repligen ] or protein G Sepharose [ Amersham Biosciences ] ) for 90 min at 4°C , followed by four washes in the NP - 40 buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 ) . Immunoprecipitates were then run on SDS - PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting . Preparation of HaCaT cell lysate and peptide pulldown . Soluble proteins were extracted from 80 % con ﬂ uent HaCaT cells by incubation for 10 min on ice in lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , protease inhibitor cocktail I [ Calbiochem ] ) . The cell lysate was col - lected by scraping the plate into a prechilled Eppendorf tube followed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm in a benchtop centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C . Next , 500 m g of each peptide ( non - phospho - peptide : biotin - LQPETTDLYCYEQLSDSSEEEDEIDG ; phospho - peptide : biotin - LQPETTDLYCYEQLpSDpSpSEEEDEIDG ; scrambled peptide : biotin - RRLQRTVEQR ) in lysis buffer , was bound to streptavidin - conjugated magnetic Sepharose beads ( Streptavidin - MagSepharose , GE Healthcare ) by incubation at 4°C on a rotating wheel for 1 h and then washed three times with lysis buffer . The cell extract was precleared by incubation with empty streptavidin - conjugated magnetic beads at 4°C on a rotating wheel for 1 h . After removal of the preclearing beads , the extract was incubated at 4°C on a rotat - ing wheel for a further 2 h with each of the biotinylated peptides bound to streptavidin - conjugated mag - netic Sepharose beads . The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors , transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes , and washed twice more with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors or Triton X - 100 . Equal amounts of beads were then analyzed using SDS - PAGE and Western blot analysis ( 56 ) . Primary baby rat kidney ( BRK ) cell transformation assay . Primary epithelial cells were obtained from the kidneys of 9 - day - old Wistar rats as described previously ( 53 ) . After 24 h , the cells were trans - fected by calcium phosphate precipitation ( 55 ) with plasmids expressing EJ - ras or HPV - 16 E7 or with plasmids expressing m 2 - HA . The cells were maintained under G418 selection for 2 weeks and then ﬁ xed and stained with Giemsa . For transformation assays in reduced growth factor conditions , DMEM supple - mented with 3 % fetal bovine serum was used . The stained colonies were counted , and a t test was used to compare the mean numbers of colonies formed in different sets of transfections , as described in “ Statistical Analysis . ” Generation of NIKS stable cell lines . NIKS empty , NIKS 16 E7 WT , and NIKS 16 E7 Y25A were gener - ated using piggyBac technology ( 57 ) . Brie ﬂ y , NIKS cells were transfected with the pCMV - HyPBase ( 57 ) and transposon plasmids pPB - MCS empty , pPB - HPV - 16 E7 or pPB - HPV - 16 E7 Y25A , and pPB - HPV - 18 E7 or pPB - HPV - 11 E7 using a ratio of 1 : 2 . 5 with FuGENE HD transfection reagent ( Promega ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions . The cells were maintained in NIKS medium as described above for 3 days , and then the cells were incubated with same medium with 1 . 25 m g / mL puromycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 4 days to allow the selec - tion of cells expressing the gene of interest . Preparation of plasma membrane fraction from cells . Plasma membrane fractions from the cells were prepared with the Minute endosome isolation and cell fractionation kit from Invent Biotechnologies ( catalog [ cat . ] no . ED - 028 ) using the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Brie ﬂ y , NIKS stable lines , CaSki , and HeLa cells were starved overnight with serum - free medium and then treated with 50 ng / mL of EGF for 1 min and 60 min . Cells ( 10 (cid:1) 10 6 to 30 (cid:1) 10 6 ) were collected using Trypsin - EDTA and low - speed centrifugation ( 600 (cid:1) g for 5 min ) . The cells were washed once with ice - cold PBS and resuspended in 500 m L of buffer A to incubate in ice for 7 min . After incubation , the cell suspension was vigorously vortexed for 15 s and immedi - ately transferred to ﬁ lter cartridge and spun for 16 , 000 (cid:1) g for 30 s . The ﬁ lter cartridge was discarded , and the pellet was then vigorously vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 700 (cid:1) g for 2 min . The supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1 . 5 - mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 4°C for 60 min . After centrifugation , the supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1 . 5 - mL tube , and the pellet ( plasma membrane fraction ) was dis - solved in Minute denaturing protein solubilization reagent ( cat . no . WA - 009 ; Invent Biotechnologies ) . This membrane fraction then was mixed with 2 (cid:1) sample buffer for SDS page and Western blotting . Statistical analysis . All experiments were performed at least thrice , and data are shown as the mean and standard error of the mean . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was calculated using GraphPad Prism soft - ware . For the quanti ﬁ cation of protein levels from Western blots , the ﬁ lms were scanned , and the inten - sity of bands was measured using ImageJ software . The ﬁ nal relative quanti ﬁ cation values are the ratio of net band to net loading control . To compare two groups , the paired Student ’ s t test was performed . A P value below 0 . 05 was considered statistically signi ﬁ cant , and a P - value above 0 . 05 was considered nonsigni ﬁ cant . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS O . B . and O .
