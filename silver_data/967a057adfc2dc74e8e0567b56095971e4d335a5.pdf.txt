Summary : Coﬁlin is an actin - binding protein that depolymerizes and / or severs actin ﬁlaments . This dual function of coﬁlin makes it one of the major regulators of actin dynamics important for T - cell acti - vation and migration . The activity of coﬁlin is spatio - temporally regu - lated . Its main control mechanisms comprise a molecular toolbox of phospho - , phospholipid , and redox regulation . Phosphorylated coﬁlin is inactive and represents the dominant coﬁlin fraction in the cytoplasm of resting human T cells . A fraction of dephosphorylated coﬁlin is kept inactive at the plasma membrane by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate . Costimulation via the T - cell receptor / CD3 complex ( signal 1 ) together with accessory receptors ( signal 2 ) or triggering through the chemokine SDF1 a ( stromal cell - derived factor 1 a ) induce Ras - dependent dephosphorylation of coﬁlin , which is important for immune synapse formation , T - cell activation , and T - cell migration . Recently , it became evident that coﬁlin is also highly sensitive for microenvironmental changes , particularly for alterations in the redox milieu . Coﬁlin is inactivated by oxidation , provoking T - cell hypore - sponsiveness or necrotic - like programmed cell death . In contrast , in a reducing environment , even phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate - bound coﬁlin becomes active , leading to actin dynamics in the vicinity of the plasma membrane . In addition to the well - established three signals for T - cell activation , this microenvironmental control of coﬁlin delivers a modulating signal for T - cell - dependent immune reactions . This fourth modulating signal highly impacts both initial T - cell activation and the effector phase of T - cell - mediated immune responses . Keywords : costimulation , T - cell activation , immune synapse , microenvironment , redox , actin cytoskeleton Introduction T cells migrate through the body and communicate with other hematopoietic or tissue - resident cells . In each new environment , T cells must adapt to the prevalent micromi - lieu , and their surface receptors have to interact with ligands on other cells or the extracellular matrix . High ﬂexibility of the entire cell body is a prerequisite for T - cell - mediated immune surveillance , including transition from the radially symmetric shape of unstimulated cells within the blood stream to bipolarly asymmetric cells during migration or immune synapse formation of T cells with antigen - presenting Immunological Reviews 2013 Vol . 256 : 30 – 47 Printed in Singapore .

The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role for these shape changes . It provides a scaffold for protein clustering and signal transduction and serves as an engine that generates physical forces important for T - cell acti - vation and migration ( 2 – 5 ) . Thus , regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is pivotal for T - cell functions . The functional rel - evance of actin rearrangements is emphasized by the fact that they belong to the major energy - consuming processes in cells , and in nature , energy is seldom wasted ( 6 , 7 ) . This review focuses on one essential protein that modulates the actin cytoskeletal architecture : the actin - severing and depolymerizing protein coﬁlin . Regulation of actin dynamics by coﬁlin The actin cytoskeleton is a meshwork composed of 42 kDa globular units ( G - actin ) that can be reversibly polymerized to polar ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) . Several nucleation - promoting factors , including the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , the WASP family Verprolin - homologous protein 2 , and the hematopoietic lineage cell – speciﬁc protein 1 , regu - late the initiation of actin polymerization through activation of the actin - related protein 2 / 3 complex ( 8 – 14 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . The pronounced phenotype of patients suffering from Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome and the knowledge about the relevance of WASP for actin polymerization ( 15 , 16 ) focused immunological research initially on WASP and other proteins important for actin polymerization , while actin - remodeling events other than actin polymerization were hardly considered for a long time . This changed during the last decade , during which time the importance of dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton became evident ( reviewed in 5 , 17 , 18 ) . It is now known that actin reorga - nization is tightly controlled in a spatio - temporal fashion during T - cell activation . Proteins that bind two actin ﬁla - ments , like L - plastin ( 19 – 24 ) or a - actinin ( 25 – 27 ) , coordi - nate the complex actin meshwork through their crosslinking and bundling activity ( Fig . 1 ) . Crosslinking or bundling of actin ﬁlaments causes an increase in cytoskeletal elasticity , thereby stabilizing the cell shape as well as cellular interac - tions . Notably , the actin cytoskeleton is not unidirectionally polymerized and / or crosslinked . Instead , it undergoes constant depolymerization / enhanced polymerization cycles termed ‘actin dynamics’ . These are mediated primarily by coﬁlin ( 5 , 28 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Coﬁlin is a 19 kDa protein that is ubiquitously expressed in all mammalian cells . It contains an actin - depolymerizing factor homology ( ADF - H ) domain , which enables stoichiometric binding of coﬁlin to both G - and F - actin ( 29 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Binding of coﬁlin to F - actin is only weakly inﬂuenced by temperature but is highly dependent on salt concentration and pH value ( 30 – 32 ) . Phosphorylation on serine 3 inactivates coﬁlin ( 33 – 35 ) by generation of a charge repulsion between coﬁlin and actin , which is thought to occur without altering the protein structure ( 36 ) . Coﬁlin is evolutionarily highly conserved and belongs to the ADF / coﬁlin family of actin - binding proteins . The family consists of three isoforms : non - muscle coﬁlin [ n - coﬁlin or coﬁlin - 1 ( CFL - 1 ) ] , muscle - speciﬁc coﬁlin [ m - coﬁlin or coﬁlin - 2 ( CFL - 2 ) ] , and ADF ( or destrin ) ( 28 ) . This review focuses on coﬁlin - 1 , which is highly expressed in human T cells ( 37 ) . Coﬁlin disassembles actin ﬁlaments by increasing the off - rate of ADP - actin at the so - called minus - pole ( or pointed - end ) of actin ﬁlaments . Thereby , coﬁlin depolymer - izes F - actin on the one hand and frees ADP - actin , making it available for recycling to ATP - actin on the other hand . In addition , coﬁlin is able to sever F - actin , which shortens the overall length of the remaining actin ﬁlaments ( 38 ) . Despite the fact that severing of F - actin into smaller pieces is one mechanism of F - actin disassembly , it also multiplies the number of actin ﬁlaments . Each of those F - actin fragments is prone to grow by polymerization at the barbed - end , which induces a net enhanced actin polymerization if the barbed - ends are not covered by capping proteins ( 5 , 38 ) . Notably , although actin rearrangements demand a high supply of energy , mere actin severing by coﬁlin is indepen - dent of energy addition , as for example generated by ATP hydrolysis . This makes enhanced actin polymerization to an energetically favorable molecular mechanism compared to de novo actin nucleation ( 30 ) . Whether coﬁlin activity results in F - actin shrinking or enhanced polymerization depends on the conditions and availability of G - actin in the speciﬁc area within the cell ( 39 – 41 ) and is likely inﬂuenced by different signaling cascades . The dual function of coﬁlin , namely depolymerization and severing , makes it a key molecule controlling actin dynamics . Therefore , it is not surprising that coﬁlin expres - sion is essential for cell survival . Coﬁlin knockout mice exhi - bit an embryonic lethal phenotype ( 42 ) , and coﬁlin null mutants are also lethal in yeast ( 43 ) . Due to this essential role , coﬁlin needs to be tightly controlled . Both extrinsic factors of the microenvironment and intrinsic signal trans - duction events mediate this coﬁlin orchestration through phospho - , phospholipid , and redox regulation of coﬁlin © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 31 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells within human T cells ( Fig . 2 ) . The signal transduction pathways and the microenvironmental elements regulating coﬁlin are discussed below . Coﬁlin activation induced by T - cell costimulation Costimulation of human T cells leads to coﬁlin activation through dephosphorylation T cells recognize antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) molecules on APCs via their antigen - speciﬁc TCR / CD3 complex . For induction of clonal growth and development of full functionality , T cells require not only the competence signal through TCR / CD3 triggering but also costimulatory signals through accessory receptors ( e . g . CD2 or CD28 ) . Absence of costimulation is one of the mechanisms leading to clonal anergy and antigen - speciﬁc tolerance ( 44 – 46 ) . In our studies of signaling processes speciﬁcally occurring after stimulation of accessory receptors on untransformed human peripheral blood T cells , we uncovered an important role for coﬁlin ( 37 , 47 ) .

Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd 32 Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells was T - cell activation through the ‘alternative pathway’ ( 48 , 49 ) , where stimulation of human T cells with monoclonal antibodies directed against two or three different epitopes of the CD2 molecule is able to fully activate T cells , even in the absence of antigen and APCs . While many signal trans - duction mechanisms are similar in terms of whether T cells are stimulated via the TCR / CD3 - complex or via the ‘alterna - tive pathway’ of T - cell activation , two - dimensional gel - electrophoresis of cells loaded with radioactively labeled orthophosphate showed that coﬁlin ( which is constitutively phosphorylated on serine 3 in the cytoplasm of resting untransformed T cells ) undergoes dephosphorylation follow - ing CD2 stimulation but not following triggering of TCR / CD3 alone ( 37 , 47 ) . The principal independence of this sig - naling process from triggering of the TCR on the cell surface was conﬁrmed by use of a CD2 + human NK cell clone in which coﬁlin likewise undergoes dephosphorylation follow - ing CD2 stimulation ( 47 ) . Induction of coﬁlin dephosphorylation / activation through the accessory receptor CD2 but not through TCR / CD3 alone gave rise to the assumption that coﬁlin represents a mediator of T - cell costimulation . Indeed , this dephosphorylation event is observed if T - cell stimulation through TCR / CD3 is accomplished by stimulation through the accessory receptors CD2 or CD28 ( 50 – 52 ) . Accordingly , in untransformed human T cells , expression of the T - cell growth factor IL - 2 , which represents a hallmark of T - cell activation after costi - mulation , is drastically reduced , if the interaction of coﬁlin with actin is blocked by cell - permeable coﬁlin peptide homologues ( 53 ) . Similar to CD2 stimulation , an activation pathway via CD28 ( in the absence of TCR / CD3 triggering ) has been described . This pathway is inducible by ‘superagonistic’ CD28 antibodies ( 54 ) . Note , however , that in contrast to ‘alternative pathway’ activation via sole stimulation of CD2 , dephosphorylation and activation of coﬁlin does not occur if untransformed human T cells are activated through ‘super - agonistic’ CD28 antibodies ( 52 ) . The same holds true for phosphorylation of the actin - bundling protein L - plastin , another costimulation - related signaling event , which coordi - nates receptor polarization upon T - cell costimulation ( 19 – 21 , 55 ) . Intriguingly , while CD3 / CD28 costimulation induces polarized large receptor clusters ( caps ) in T cells , crosslinking of ‘superagonistic’ CD28 antibodies provokes only small receptor clusters that fail to coalesce at one pole of the cell . Thus , ‘superagonistic’ CD28 stimulation does not mimic T - cell costimulation . Instead it represents induction of a coﬁlin and L - plastin independent state of ‘unpolarized’ T - cell activation ( 52 ) . Coﬁlin - dependent actin dynamics are crucial for the maturation of the immune synapse Upon antigen recognition , a specialized contact zone between T cells and APCs is formed , in which these cells communicate and transduce signals leading to T - cell activa - tion , proliferation , and differentiation . Analogous to the neuronal synapse , this contact zone is called immune syn - apse ( 56 ) . Actin dynamics in the immune synapse induce radio symmetric forces from the edge inwards , and an orga - nized receptor movement ( as microclusters ) in the immune synapse is generated ( 57 – 60 ) . During this immune synapse maturation , surface receptors and cytoplasmic proteins are segregated in supramolecular activation clusters ( SMACs ) within the T - cell / APC contact zone . Three SMACs have been described , which are named central SMAC ( cSMAC ) , periph - eral SMAC ( pSMAC ) , and distal SMAC ( dSMAC ) , according to their relative localization in the cell interface ( Fig . 3 ) . The cSMAC contains the TCR / CD3 complex , whereas the pSMAC has a high content of lymphocyte function - associated anti - gen 1 ( LFA - 1 ) , and the dSMAC harbors receptors with large extracellular domains like CD45 ( reviewed in 1 , 61 ) . Nota - bly , both costimulation and sustained actin dynamics are important to build and maintain a mature immune synapse ( 4 , 17 , 62 – 65 ) . Upon antigen recognition , coﬁlin is enriched concentrically at the periphery of the contact zone , that is , the pSMAC and dSMAC ( 53 , 66 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Interaction of coﬁlin with actin is crucial for receptor redistribution and actin dynamics within this contact zone ( 53 ) . Moreover , the Fig . 2 . Regulation sites of coﬁlin . Coﬁlin is a highly regulated protein . The ﬁgure displays a threefold regulation of coﬁlin : phospho - regulation at serine 3 , redox regulation at cysteine residues , and phospholipid regulation via PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding . © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 33 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells effects of coﬁlin for protein segregation at the immune synapse are receptor speciﬁc . Thus , inhibition of coﬁlin by coﬁlin - derived , cell - permeable peptides that interfere with the binding of coﬁlin to actin reduces accumulation of the costimulatory receptor CD2 at the pSMAC of the immune synapse . However , enrichment of the TCR / CD3 complex in the cSMAC remains unchanged ( 53 ) . In conclusion , activa - tion of the actin - remodeling protein coﬁlin represents a long - sought molecular mechanism that links T - cell costimu - lation to actin dynamics - dependent maturation of the immune synapse ( 50 , 53 ) . Nuclear functions of coﬁlin In addition to its function in the cytoplasm , dephosphoryl - ated coﬁlin has the ability to translocate into the nucleus . Initially , coﬁlin was detected in intranuclear actin rods fol - lowing treatment of the mouse ﬁbroblast cell line C3H - ZK with dimethylsulfoxide or following exposure of these cells to heat shock ( 67 ) . Note that ‘actin / coﬁlin rods’ do not bind phalloidin . In 1994 , we showed for the ﬁrst time that coﬁlin translocation into the nucleus succeeds triggering of a cell surface receptor , namely CD2 stimulation of untrans - formed human T cells ( 37 ) . By use of single amino acid point mutations , it could be shown that dephosphorylation of coﬁlin on serine 3 is required to enable its nuclear trans - location ( 35 ) . Coﬁlin contains a nuclear localization sequence ( KKRKK ) similar to the nuclear translocation signal sequence of simian virus 40T antigen ( 68 , 69 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . As coﬁlin but not actin bears a nuclear localization signal , coﬁlin acts as an actin transporter into the nucleus ( 70 ) . In malignant T - lymphoma cells , dephosphorylation of coﬁlin as well as the nuclear translocation of coﬁlin together with actin happens spontaneously ( 71 ) . As shown by confo - cal laser scanning microscopy following intracellular staining of T - lymphoma cells with rabbit antisera against actin and coﬁlin , both proteins colocalize within nuclei . Yet , actin / coﬁlin rods do not occur . The serine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid prevents dephosphorylation of coﬁlin and nuclear translocation of coﬁlin and actin . Okadaic acid rep - resents an inhibitor of the serine phosphatases PP1 ( protein phosphatase 1 ) and PP2A . These ﬁndings imply a role of PP1 or PP2A in the spontaneous dephosphorylation of coﬁ - lin in transformed cells . At the same time , okadaic acid induced apoptosis of lymphoma cells ( 71 ) . Considering the fact that actin has the capability to inactivate DNase I ( 72 ) , an enzyme involved in apoptosis ( 73 , 74 ) , inhibition of the actin import into the nucleus by prevention of coﬁlin dephosphorylation may contribute to the apoptotic DNA fragmentation observed following okadaic acid treatment . Besides the potential anti - apoptotic function of coﬁlin , we speculated that another function of coﬁlin may be the enhancement of transcriptional processes ( 37 ) . This conclu - sion was based on ﬁndings that injection of actin antibodies into oocyte nuclei drastically inhibited the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase II and led to changes in chro - mosome morphology ( 75 , 76 ) . Later it was shown that in mammalian cells actin plays an important role for the regu - lation of different nuclear processes like transcription , chromatin remodeling , and nucleocytoplasmic trafﬁcking . Importantly , it has been shown only recently in HeLa cells that coﬁlin is indeed required for RNA polymerase II tran - scription elongation ( 77 – 79 ) . These potential functions of intranuclear actin / coﬁlin complexes , enhancement of tran - scription , and prevention of apoptosis , precisely represent mechanisms that one would expect to occur upon malignant transformation as well as following T - cell costimulation . In conclusion , coﬁlin - mediated actin remodeling is not only a central integrator of costimulation in the immune synapse but rather may fulﬁll key functions also within the nucleus by enhancing transcription and preventing apoptosis . Signaling cascades involved in coﬁlin dephosphorylation In response to costimulation , coﬁlin activation in untrans - formed human T cells is initiated via a Ras - MEK / PI3K ( Rat Fig . 3 .

Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd 34 Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells sarcoma - mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase / phospho - inositide 3 - kinase ) signaling cascade ( 51 ) . This was concluded from the following ﬁndings : ﬁrst , transient expression of cDNA - encoded constitutively active Ras in T cells results in dephosphorylation of coﬁlin . Second , dephos - phorylation of coﬁlin after T - cell costimulation or expres - sion of constitutively active Ras can be prevented by inhibitors of MEK or PI3K . Final proof that the GTPase Ras plays a central role in the regulation of coﬁlin dephosphory - lation came from experiments where we showed that expression of a dominant negative form of Ras in untrans - formed human T cells prevents activation of PI3K and dephosphorylation of coﬁlin after costimulation through CD3 / CD28 . Initially , these ﬁndings were surprising , since so far it was thought that PI3K is a substrate of Ras in all cell types except T cells ( 80 ) . Yet , in the cells that were used in this study , namely the Jurkat T - lymphoma cell line , the situation is indeed different from untransformed T cells . In Jurkat cells , PKB ( protein kinase B ) / Akt phosphorylation and coﬁlin dephosphorylation occur spontaneously in the absence of Ras activation ( 51 ) . Also , in untransformed human T cells , dephosphorylation of coﬁlin can be blocked by the serine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid ( 47 ) . Interestingly , both PP1 and PP2A were found to associate with and to dephosphorylate coﬁlin ( 81 ) . In principle , the phosphorylation state of coﬁlin can be inﬂuenced by at least two other serine phosphatases , namely slingshot ( 82 ) and chronophin ( 83 ) . Phosphorylation and thereby inactivation of coﬁlin is mediated by LimKinase ( LimK ) and testis - speciﬁc kinases ( TES kinases ) ( reviewed in 84 ) . The involvement of PP1 in coﬁlin regulation could recently be conﬁrmed by knockdown of PP1 in untrans - formed human T cells ( 85 ) . The contribution of the other enzymes to the regulation of coﬁlin in untransformed T cells remains to be analyzed in detail . Implication of the Ras - coﬁlin pathway for T - cell anergy prevention Recognition of antigen without costimulatory signals induces clonal anergy or apoptosis of T cells , a process enabling peripheral tolerance ( 44 – 46 , 86 ) . Anergic T cells are tolerant toward their antigen and do not execute effector functions . Notably , they are not able to produce IL - 2 in response to sec - ondary antigen exposure . Due to the induction of anergy , potential autoreactive T cells that escaped the selection for central tolerance in the thymus and circulate within the blood stream are not hazardous for the organism . The molecular mechanisms for the induction of periph - eral tolerance are not yet fully understood . There are several lines of evidence that an altered regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the induction or maintenance of T - cell anergy ( 87 , 88 ) . As described above , coﬁlin dephos - phorylation is part of a costimulatory signaling pathway and may therefore link costimulation and anergy prevention via its regulatory functions on actin dynamics . Like coﬁlin acti - vation , full Ras activation is also a costimulation - dependent event in primary human T cells ( 52 ) and in mouse T cells ( 89 ) . Thus , TCR / CD3 triggering alone provokes only a very weak Ras activation , whereas upon costimulation via CD28 , a strong ( synergistic ) activation of Ras is induced . That Ras is indeed important for anergy prevention was underlined by the following ﬁndings : ﬁrst , activation of Ras is blocked in primary anergic T cells ( 90 ) , and second , expression of constitutively active Ras in once anergic T cells enables them to produce IL - 2 ( 91 ) . Since costimulation - induced coﬁlin dephosphorylation is mediated via Ras ( 51 ) , it is tempting to speculate that active Ras mediates T - cell anergy preven - tion via coﬁlin activation , thereby leading to an increase in actin dynamics . Consequently , blocking the Ras - coﬁlin path - way in T cells may serve as a valuable means to enable induction of antigen - speciﬁc anergy . Chemokine - mediated activation of coﬁlin during migration of T cells The actin cytoskeleton fundamentally controls the stop - and - go behavior of T cells . Hence , the force vectors induced by radio symmetric actin dynamics in the immune synapse neutralize each other and induce a stop of T - cell migration , which is important for T - cell activation ( 66 , 92 ) . T cells leave their cognate APCs after their symmetry is broken through polar forces induced by asymmetric actin dynamics ( 66 ) . Chemokines then control the migration of T cells in lymphoid organs , their extravasation , and their movement in inﬂamed tissues . Triggering of T cells with chemokines induces cell polari - zation by forming a lamellipodium at the leading edge and a uropod at the rear . In principle , there are two modes of T - cell migration which are used dependent on the microen - vironment . On two - dimensional surfaces as they occur on endothelial cells of vessel walls in vivo or in petri dishes coated with integrin - ligands in vitro , T cells migrate via short - lived interactions of integrins with their substrates and subsequent oscillatory T - cell shape changes mediated via the actomyosin system . This mode of migration is called amoe - © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 35 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells boid migration ( 93 , 94 ) . The situation changes if T cells reach three - dimensional environments in interstitial space or extracellular matrix within tissues . Here , migration is not dependent on integrins . T cells migrate in three - dimensional environments by adapting their shape and squeezing through narrow gaps within the extracellular matrix . This movement is highly dependent on constant actin dynamics that induce an actin ﬂow toward the cell front ( 94 – 101 ) . Interference with coﬁlin activation or expression has no signiﬁcant impact on T - cell migration on two - dimensional substrates , as for example on cell culture plates that are coated with ICAM - 1 ( intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ) ( 101 ) . This result is in line with the fact that actin dynamics are of minor importance for amoeboid migration . Coﬁlin only becomes relevant for T - cell migration on two - dimen - sional substrates if G - actin availability is limited ( e . g . through latrunculin ) or if T cells are forced to migrate via constant actin dynamics ( e . g . by inhibiting actomyosin via blebbistatin ) . Importantly , coﬁlin - dependent actin dynamics are pivotal in three - dimensional environments , as they occur in tissues and can be mimicked by Matrigel (cid:1) matrices . By interference with the signaling pathway leading to coﬁlin dephosphorylation or by a knockdown of coﬁlin expression , we showed that in the absence of coﬁlin - driven actin - modulation , migration in three - dimensional environments in terms of directionality , velocity , and euclidean distance is strongly reduced ( 101 ) . Altogether , this demonstrates that the coﬁlin - mediated dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is the engine that allows crawling of T cells especially in the three - dimensional environment of tissues . T - cell migration needs a spatio - temporal regulation of coﬁlin to assure a timely movement and directionality . In line with the dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskele - ton at the leading edge , in untransformed human T cells , coﬁlin is dephosphorylated at the lamellipodium via a Ras - MEK signaling module in response to chemokine stimulation ( 101 ) . Mizuno and coworkers ( 102 ) reported a chemokine - induced phosphorylation rather than a dephosphorylation of coﬁlin . Differing from our experiments , their data were derived from Jurkat lymphoma cells . In this system , how - ever , the phosphorylation state of coﬁlin is shifted toward the dephosphorylated protein without any stimulation , due to a constitutively active PI3K pathway ( 51 , 103 ) . In untransformed human T cells , activation of the Ras - MEK pathway by SDF1 a leads to inhibition of the coﬁlin kinase LimK , thereby shifting the kinase / phosphatase balance toward the phosphatase ( 101 ) . Since one of the coﬁlin phosphatases , namely PP2A , is constitutively active in primary human T cells , dominance of PP2A over LimK activity could mediate coﬁlin dephosphorylation upon chemokine treatment . Contrary to T - cell costimulation , PI3K is not involved in this chemokine - dependent coﬁlin dephos - phorylation ( 51 , 101 ) . The difference in dependence of coﬁlin dephosphorylation on PI3K signaling may result from costimulation - dependent deactivation of PP2A , since this phosphatase was found to be associated with CD28 ( 104 ) . Costimulation - induced deactivation of PP2A would require activation of another coﬁlin phosphatase to ensure coﬁlin dephosphorylation , which is presumably regulated by PI3K . In summary , exposure of primary human T cells to chemokines ( e . g . the CXCR4 ligand SDF1 a ) induces a Ras - MEK - dependent activation of coﬁlin in the lamellipodium . The resulting onset of actin dynamics at the cell front is cru - cial for T - cell migration in three - dimensional tissues yet is dispensable for crawling on two - dimensional substrates . Phospholipid regulation of coﬁlin at the cell membrane Coﬁlin activation through dephosphorylation starts within 5 min after costimulation of primary human T cells and takes up to 30 min to reach its pinnacle . The initial rise in F - actin occurs during the ﬁrst few minutes after costimula - tion or chemokine treatment and declines within the following 5 min . Thereafter , it stays at a level that is still signiﬁcantly elevated compared to unstimulated cells ( 105 ) . The kinetics suggests a faster activation of coﬁlin than observed by its phophoregulation . Such an immediate con - trol of the actin - depolymerizing activity of coﬁlin is likely mediated by phospholipid regulation . Thus , one of the actin - binding motifs of coﬁlin also interacts with phosphati - dylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , however , not with its cleavage products inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) ( Fig . 2 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding to coﬁlin inhibits its capacity to associate with and depolymerize F - actin ( 106 – 108 ) . PLC activation , although controlled by TCR signaling , is boosted by CD28 - mediated T - cell costimu - lation , which leads to an enhanced costimulation - dependent PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 cleavage ( 109 – 111 ) . Therefore , we postulated that in response to costimulation , a release of coﬁlin from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inhibition may belong to the earliest events of T - cell activation ( 37 ) . This assumption is supported by recent work showing that stimulation of carcinoma cells with epidermal growth factor leads to a fast hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and as a consequence , dephosphorylated coﬁlin is rap - idly released from the cell membrane ( 39 , 112 – 114 ) . Aside © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd 36 Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells from this temporal regulation of coﬁlin , phospholipid regu - lation also provides spatial control of coﬁlin activity . Coﬁlin inhibition by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 takes place near the cell membrane , whereas phosphorylation ( inactivation ) of coﬁlin by LimK is compartmentalized to the cytosol ( 40 , 115 ) . It was pro - posed that this mechanism explains how coﬁlin is activated speciﬁcally within lamellipodia or invadosomes of metasta - sizing tumor cells to produce the asymmetric force that is necessary for migration of the tumor cells ( 40 , 116 ) . Regulation of coﬁlin by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 cleavage represents an intrinsic molecular mechanism for a spatio - temporal induc - tion of actin dynamics in carcinoma cells . Accordingly , it is tempting to speculate that a phospholipase - mediated libera - tion of dephosphorylated coﬁlin from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 upon T - cell costimulation is responsible for the initial actin dynamics that precedes Ras - dependent coﬁlin dephosphorylation . Redox regulation of coﬁlin and its impact on T - cell - mediated immune responses The actin - binding and remodeling abilities of coﬁlin are inﬂu - enced not only by intrinsic factors like phosphorylation and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding but also by microenvironmental conditions . Surrounding factors modulate coﬁlin functions independently and thus allow adaptation of immune responses to speciﬁc tis - sues and microenvironmental circumstances . In this regard , our group was the ﬁrst one to show that coﬁlin is directly targeted by both oxidation and reduction , leading to coﬁlin regulation through thiol modiﬁcations in human T cells ( 85 , 105 , 117 ) . Thereby , coﬁlin serves as molecular sensor that translates changes of the redox microenvironment into cellu - lar functions . Oxidation - induced molecular changes of coﬁlin result in disturbed actin dynamics Physiologically , a pro - oxidative milieu exists in the gut , which is important to control T - cell activation in a microen - vironment in which these cells must tolerate food antigens ( 118 – 121 ) . Pathologically , a shift toward oxidative stress occurs during inﬂammation where activated granulocytes and macrophages release reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Similarly , a pro - oxidative micromilieu prevails in certain tumors . Such an accumulation of ROS causes local or general immunosuppression , which is characterized by T - cell hyporesponsiveness ( 122 – 124 ) . This malfunction of T - cell - mediated immunity is accompanied by an altered actin cytoskeleton within these cells ( 105 ) . When exoge - nous ROS are present , primary human T cells display not only a higher amount of steady - state F - actin but also have deﬁciencies in actin modulation upon cell surface receptor triggering . We showed that these disturbed actin dynamics can be explained by a direct oxidation of coﬁlin : upon oxidation , the structure of coﬁlin changes , and as a consequence , it loses its actin - depolymerizing ability , even though it is still able to bind F - actin ( 105 ) . The functional relevance of an observed diminished binding of oxidized coﬁlin to G - actin remains as yet unknown ( 125 ) . Regarding the impaired actin - depolymerizing activity of oxidized coﬁlin , initially it seemed likely that oxidative stress leads to enhanced coﬁlin phosphorylation , thereby prevent - ing its activity . Surprisingly , oxidative stress does not promote phosphorylation of coﬁlin but rather increases the proportion of unphosphorylated coﬁlin induced by costimu - lation of T cells ( 105 ) . Even culturing T cells with hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) alone is sufﬁcient to induce coﬁlin dephos - phorylation over time without further stimuli . As described above , MEK and PI3K ( downstream effectors of Ras ) are key proteins in the signaling cascade leading to coﬁlin dephos - phorylation after T - cell costimulation ( 51 ) . Although these two proteins are activated by oxidative stress ( yet indepen - dently of Ras ) , they do not play a role in the H 2 O 2 - induced diminished phosphorylation of coﬁlin ( 105 ) . Thus , the molecular mechanisms propagating decreased coﬁlin phos - phorylation after T - cell costimulation versus oxidative stress are distinct from each other . Our studies revealed that oxi - dized coﬁlin is a poor target for the coﬁlin kinase LimK , which leads to an increase in the proportion of unphosphor - ylated yet inactive coﬁlin ( 105 ) . Thiol groups of cysteines are the most prominent targets for oxidation in proteins . They can form reversible inter - or intramolecular disulﬁde bonds or can be modiﬁed into higher oxidized ( in part irreversible ) forms like sulﬁnic ( RSO 2 H ) or sulfonic ( RSO 3 H ) acids ( 126 ) . Coﬁlin contains four cysteine residues ( at the positions 39 , 80 , 140 , and 148 ) that are potential targets for ROS ( Fig . 2 ) . Indeed , H 2 O 2 treatment induces a slight mobility shift of coﬁlin in non - reducing SDS - PAGE . Addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol abolishes this shift , suggesting reversible structural changes and the presence of at least one disulﬁde bridge in oxidized coﬁlin ( 105 ) . In the tertiary structure of coﬁlin , cysteines 39 and 80 are buried inside the molecule , whereas cysteines 139 and 147 face the outside ( 127 ) . By electrospray mass spectrome - try of human recombinant coﬁlin , we revealed that under oxidative stress conditions , cysteine 139 is modiﬁed to a sul - fonic acid ( Cys - SO 3 H ) , and the inner cysteines 39 and 80 are © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 37 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells likely engaged in an intramolecular disulﬁde bridge ( 105 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Disulﬁde bridge formation within the coﬁlin mole - cule was later independently conﬁrmed in COS cells and B - lymphoma cells treated with taurine chloramine ( TnCl ) , another oxidizing agent ( 125 ) . In addition , the existence of another intramolecular disulﬁde bridge between cysteines 139 and 147 was proposed in that study . Moreover , intermo - lecular disulﬁde bridges leading to coﬁlin dimers or oligo - mers have been described in vitro ( 128 ) and in glutamate - stressed neuronal cells ( 129 ) . Altogether , coﬁlin oxidation is a phenomenon that has been described in different cell types and under diverse oxidative conditions ; however , the suscep - tibility toward oxidative stress and the functional conse - quences differ between cell types . Coﬁlin cysteine - oxidation leads to T - cell hyporesponsiveness As described above , oxidative stress leads to an impaired actin remodeling by coﬁlin . On the cellular level , impaired actin dynamics during antigen - speciﬁc T - cell activation in the presence of H 2 O 2 manifest in a disturbed immune syn - apse maturation : coﬁlin as well as LFA - 1 do not properly localize to the T cell / APC contact zone ( 105 ) , which is rem - iniscent of the phenotype observed if the interaction of coﬁ - lin with actin is blocked by cell - permeable coﬁlin peptide homologues ( 53 ) . In accordance with its effects on immune synapse formation , oxidative stress interferes with T - cell activation and consequently induces T - cell hyporesponsive - ness ( 105 ) . This hyporesponsive state is reinforced by inhi - bition of the migratory capacity of T cells in a pro - oxidative microenvironment . Hence , T cells that are exposed to H 2 O 2 exhibit defective F - actin polarization , are not able to adhere to immobilized ICAM - 1 , and lose their ability to migrate toward chemokine gradients . Interestingly , T cells whose endogenous coﬁlin is replaced by C39G or C80G coﬁlin ( carrying a glycine instead of a cysteine at position 39 or 80 ) show similar characteristics as oxidatively stressed T cells ( e . g . costimulation - dependent activation is strongly impaired if T cells express C39G coﬁlin even in the absence of ROS ) . The cysteine - to - glycine mutants C39G and C80G coﬁlin are therefore on the functional level considered as oxidation - mimicking coﬁlin mutants ( 105 , 117 ) . Mitochondrial translocation of oxidized coﬁlin provokes necrotic - like programmed cell death Exposing primary human T cells to H 2 O 2 for expanded time periods can even result in T - cell death ( 117 , 130 , 131 ) . Electron microscopy and InFlow microscopy revealed that coﬁlin itself localizes within mitochondria of T cells after long - term treatment with H 2 O 2 ( 117 ) . Using our oxidation - mimicking coﬁlin mutants , we identiﬁed the oxidation - induced changes of coﬁlin as the relevant molecular switch that targets coﬁlin to the mitochondria . A single point muta - tion at cysteine 39 or 80 to glycine is sufﬁcient for mito - chondrial translocation of coﬁlin and induction of T - cell death . A change of cysteine to non - oxidizable alanine in coﬁlin , in contrast , can rescue T cells from death induced by H 2 O 2 . These two types of coﬁlin mutants , oxidation - mimicking cysteine - to - glycine mutants and oxidation - resis - tant cysteine - to - alanine mutants , are valuable tools to further elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to and resulting from coﬁlin oxidation . Chua and colleagues ( 132 ) demonstrated that coﬁlin trans - locates to mitochondria in staurosporine - treated mammalian cell lines ( e . g . COS - 7 ) and that this coﬁlin translocation is an early step in cell death . The molecular mechanism of coﬁlin transport to the mitochondria , however , was not elucidated in this study . In T cells , heat - shock cognate protein 70 ( HSC70 ) , a chaperone transporting certain proteins into mitochondria ( 133 , 134 ) , seems to be one effector molecule in transferring oxidized coﬁlin to the mitochondria . Upon long - term oxida - tive stress , HCS70 binds to and colocalizes with coﬁlin at the mitochondrial membrane ( 117 ) . Moreover , the oxidation - mimicking coﬁlin mutants bind to HSC70 even in the absence of H 2 O 2 . Having discovered that coﬁlin translocation into mitochondria is controlled by oxidation of coﬁlin and a guided transport mechanism , it seemed likely that coﬁlin is directly involved in the induction of T - cell death upon oxida - tive stress . In line with this assumption , targeting of coﬁlin to mitochondria by introducing the oxidation - mimicking mutants into T cells ( 117 ) or targeting of coﬁlin into mito - chondria of COS cells by fusion to a mitochondrial targeting sequence ( 132 ) leads to mitochondrial disintegration and cytochrome C release . Despite this cytochrome C release , T - cell death provoked by treatment with H 2 O 2 or by expres - sion of oxidation - mimicking coﬁlin mutants is caspase independent ( 117 ) . In addition , no DNA fragmentation or other signs of apoptosis ( or autophagy ) are detectable . These observations deﬁne the H 2 O 2 - induced T - cell death to be of a necrotic - like phenotype . The fact that expressing oxidation - resistant coﬁlin mutants or downregulation of coﬁlin via siRNA rescues the majority of T cells from oxidant - induced cell death highlights the indispensable role of coﬁlin in the H 2 O 2 - triggered necrotic - like T - cell death and demonstrates © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd 38 Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells that it is a programmed rather than an accidental type of cell death ( 117 , 135 ) . The sensitivity toward oxidative stress depends on the T - cell subpopulation . Naive T cells are less sensitive toward oxidative stress induced by low micromolar concentrations of H 2 O 2 than central and effector memory cells ( 130 ) . Moreover , the mode of cell death seems to be depen - dent on the cell death - inducing agent and cell type analyzed . Thus , in contrast to H 2 O 2 - induced necrotic - like programmed cell death in untransformed human T cells , staurosporine - induced and coﬁlin - dependent cell death of COS cells ( 132 ) as well as TnCl - induced cell death in COS cells and B - lym - phoma cells ( 125 ) were reported to occur by apoptosis rather than necrotic - like programmed cell death . Reduction of coﬁlin as a spatio - microenvironmental control mechanism of actin dynamics As described above , accumulation of ROS can have detrimen - tal effects on T - cell functions and survival ( 105 , 117 ) . With - out effective protection , T cells would malfunction in every situation in which a pro - oxidative milieu predominates . To overcome this problem , the body has evolved mechanisms to guard T cells from such an oxidative stress - mediated immune suppression . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) , for example , can induce the upregulation of free thiols inside antigen - speciﬁc T cells during an infection and can thereby rescue them from harmful consequences of ROS at the site of inﬂammation ( 136 – 138 ) . Which proteins are affected by this environment , however , remained unclear . Recently , we found that coﬁlin is such a target for reduction ; treatment of human coﬁlin with reducing agents results in changes of its 3D - ( NMR ) - structure ( 85 ) . These structural changes do not alter the actin - depoly - merizing function of coﬁlin in the absence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . However , they render dephosphorylated coﬁlin insensitive toward inhibition by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ although PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 still binds to reduced coﬁlin ] . Thus , under reducing conditions , an addi - tional pool of active coﬁlin , which is still anchored to the membrane by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , can lead to increased actin dynamics especially during immune synapse formation . In line with this observation , we found that in untransformed human T cells the F - actin content in the immune synapse is diminished , if the T cell / APC contact occurs within a reducing milieu . In conclusion , reduction of coﬁlin , which renders it insensitive to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inhibition , may raise the amounts of active coﬁlin near the plasma membrane . Thereby , a reduc - ing milieu may upregulate actin dynamics at the immune synapse and the rate of T - cell activation . In a pro - oxidative environment , coﬁlin reduction may enhance resistance toward oxidative stress - induced T - cell hyporesponsiveness . Ultimately , for the fate of the T cell , it may be crucial which side of the redox spectrum outweighs the other , for example , how long the protective reducing intracellular milieu is exposed to oxidative stress . Comprehensive model of spatio - temporal and microenvironmental regulation of coﬁlin In this review , we have described that coﬁlin - induced actin dynamics are important for immune synapse formation , T - cell activation ( 50 , 53 , 105 ) , and T - cell migration ( 101 ) . Taking these vital functions of coﬁlin into account , it is clear that coﬁlin needs to be tightly controlled in different subcel - lular compartments . Here , we introduce a model of ‘spatio - temporal and microenvironmental control of coﬁlin in T cells’ ( Fig . 4 ) . It is based on in vitro data and data derived from T cells or other cellular systems . In resting human T cells , coﬁlin is mainly inactive and exists in distinct subcel - lular locations . Cytoplasmic coﬁlin is mainly phosphorylated and thus in an inactive state . The membrane - bound fraction of coﬁlin is dephosphorylated but kept inactive by binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Both the cytoplasmic fraction and at least a proportion of the membrane - bound coﬁlin are activated by T - cell costimulation . Cytoplasmic coﬁlin becomes dephos - phorylated through costimulation - induced activation of Ras and its downstream effectors PI3K and MEK ( 51 ) . Mem - brane - bound dephosphorylated coﬁlin can be activated by PLC - dependent PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 cleavage releasing dephosphoryl - ated coﬁlin into the cytoplasm ( 38 , 40 , 112 ) . Thereby , the cytoplasmic pool of activated coﬁlin is increased and actin dynamics are reinforced . Moreover , dephosphorylated coﬁlin can translocate into the nucleus ( 37 ) , where it may act as actin shuttle and as chaperone for RNA polymerase II - dependent gene transcription ( 70 , 79 , 139 – 141 ) . Although costimulation boosts PLC activation , a large amount of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 remains uncleaved . Therefore , a signiﬁcant fraction of coﬁlin remains inactive at the plasma membrane . This PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - bound fraction can be activated in situ by the creation of a reducing milieu in T cells . Thus , antigen - speciﬁc T - cell activation via DCs not only provides costimulation but DCs can also induce an increase of free thi - ols within T cells in an antigen - speciﬁc manner ( 136 ) . Such a reducing milieu changes the structure of coﬁlin and makes it insensitive toward inhibition by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 85 ) . The resulting additional activation of coﬁlin at the plasma membrane in a reducing environment does not only increase the total pool of active coﬁlin within T cells but also represents a spatial © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 39 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells control of coﬁlin function . This mechanism appears to be especially important for the dynamics of cortical actin as the activated coﬁlin is still bound to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and thus remains at the plasma membrane . The reducing conditions induced by DCs ( 136 ) can also protect T cells surrounded by a pro - oxidative environment . Oxidative stress occurs if ROS exceed the reducing potential within the cytoplasm . Coﬁlin becomes inactivated during Fig . 4 . Spatio - temporal and microenvironmental control of coﬁlin in T cells . Costimulation induces coﬁlin activation via Ras ( A1 ) , which results in coﬁlin dephosphorylation in the cytoplasm , and via PLC ( A2 ) , which liberates dephosphorylated coﬁlin from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inhibition . This results in the onset of activation - induced actin dynamics ( B ) . In addition to its functions for actin dynamics , dephosphorylated coﬁlin can carry actin into the nucleus ( C ) . Thereby , it can modulate gene transcription by altering the nuclear actin pool and the activity of RNA polymerase II . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 bound coﬁlin is inactive and detains F - actin at the plasma membrane ( = cortical actin , D ) . In the presence of a reducing milieu , this coﬁlin pool gets active despite binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Thereby , actin dynamics near the plasma membrane are enhanced ( E ) . In contrast , a strong pro - oxidative milieu can oxidize ( inactivate ) coﬁlin which results in a stiff actin cytoskeleton and T - cell hyporesponsiveness or even necrotic - like programmed cell death ( NL - PCD ) through mitochondrial disintegration ( F ) . © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd 40 Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells oxidative stress , which ultimately leads to T - cell hyporesponsiveness due to an inability of coﬁlin to induce actin dynamics and eventually a stiffening of the actin cyto - skeleton ( 105 ) . Moreover , as a long - term effect , oxidized coﬁlin binds to HSC70 and translocates into the mitochon - dria , provoking their disintegration and induction of necro - tic - like programmed T - cell death ( 117 ) . Altogether , signal transduction pathways , factors of the microenvironment , or both can control each of these coﬁlin pools in different sub - cellular localizations with distinct kinetics , thereby inﬂuenc - ing the outcome of a T - cell - mediated immune response . Relevance of coﬁlin in diseases The role of coﬁlin for uptake and spreading of pathogens Cortical F - actin represents a mechanical barrier for entry of pathogens into T cells . Thus , pathogens need to induce phagocytosis and / or an active breakdown of the F - actin structures near the plasma membrane to get access to the host cell . Since coﬁlin represents the main actin - depolymer - izing factor , some pathogens like Listeria monocytogenes and the human immunodeﬁciency virus ( HIV ) evolved mechanisms to highjack coﬁlin to increase their pathogenicity . Listeriosis is an infectious disease caused by the Gram - positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes . The severity of the disease is in part due to the ability of L . monocytogenes to evade the immune system by hiding within the cytoplasm of host cells . L . monocytogenes can not only persist within the host cells but also spread through cell - to - cell migration without reaching the extracellular space ( reviewed in 142 ) . The cell invasion and cell - to - cell spreading is in different steps dependent on coﬁlin , and , thus , coﬁlin is an important factor in the pathology of listeriosis . The surface receptor internalin B of L . monocytogenes binds to the MET - receptor and increases the level of phospho - coﬁlin via activation of LimK in the host cytoplasm . Phosphorylated coﬁlin is inactive for induction of actin dynamics , but it is necessary for activa - tion of phospholipase D , which is required for the invasion of L . monocytogenes into host cells ( 143 , 144 ) . However , the inactivation of coﬁlin must be balanced during L . monocytoge - nes internalization , since , as mentioned above , the barrier of cortical F - actin needs to be broken down through coﬁlin activation ( 145 ) . In addition to its role for host cell penetra - tion , L . monocytogenes recruits the host’s actin cytoskeleton to create actin comet tails within the cytoplasm . Coﬁlin is one important factor to create actin dynamics in the comet tail to generate a force for bacterial movement within the host cell ( 146 , 147 ) . Importantly , this actin - based movement enables L . monocytogenes to spread into neighboring cells with - out reaching the extracellular space . This keeps the bacteria hidden from phagocytosis by innate immune cells and prevents their antibody - mediated opsonization or neutraliza - tion . Thus , coﬁlin regulation is an important step for the pathogenicity of Listeria spp . ( 142 , 148 ) . HIV infects human T cells and thus interferes with T - cell - mediated immunity . Yoder and colleagues ( 149 ) demon - strated that HIV triggers its uptake by binding to the HIV co - receptor CXCR4 . Binding of HIV to CXCR4 activates coﬁ - lin , which consequently breaks down the cortical actin through the induction of actin dynamics , allowing entry of the virus . We have recently shown that T - cell stimulation via the chemokine receptor CXCR4 through it natural ligand SDF1 a leads to coﬁlin activation via a Ras - MEK signaling module and an acceleration of actin dynamics ( 101 ) . It would be interesting to know whether the HIV - induced coﬁlin dephosphorylation follows the same signaling path - ways as triggered by SDF1 a to allow virus entry . After the successful infection , the HIV genome is transcribed within the cytoplasm of the host cell . Thereby , the negative regula - tory factor ( Nef ) is expressed as one important protein for HIV pathogenesis . Expression of Nef induces phosphoryla - tion and thus deactivation of coﬁlin via binding to p21 - activated kinase 2 ( Pak2 ) ( 149 , 151 ) . It was suggested that this coﬁlin inactivation is pivotal for inhibiting the chemoki - ne - dependent migration of HIV - infected T cells . Eventually , these T cells are not able to provide B - cell help and thus the induction of germinal centers and production of high afﬁn - ity antibodies is dampened . In addition , the slowing down of HIV - infected T cells may induce a microenvironment enriched by these cells and thereby facilitate infection of bystander T cells . Thus , HIVs use coﬁlin at different stages of their infection cycle . The role of coﬁlin in cancer In malignant T - lymphoma cells the phosphorylation state of coﬁlin is shifted toward the dephosphorylated and thus active form of coﬁlin ( 37 ) . This is a tumor - promoting mechanism , since a coﬁlin knockdown diminishes the clon - ing efﬁciency of these cells and interference with the respec - tive coﬁlin phosphatases induces apoptosis of T - lymphoma cells ( 71 ) . Coﬁlin is also constitutively dephosphorylated in non - hematopoietic tumor cells , such as the cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa or the colon carcinoma cell line KM12 ( 35 ) . Within the last decade , coﬁlin expression and its activation © 2013 The Authors . Immunological Reviews published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Immunological Reviews 256 / 2013 41 Samstag et al (cid:1) Coﬁlin regulates actin dynamics in T cells state were described as determining the metastatic potential of tumor cells . They represent major factors of the severity of the disease in several cancer entities , such as breast cancer ( 116 , 152 ) . One main function of coﬁlin in these tumor cells is its role for chemotaxis , directionality ( 153 , 154 ) , and the maturation of the invadopodium ( 155 , 156 ) . Another mechanism favoring cancer progression is the potential downregulation of coﬁlin activity in T cells by tumor cells or tumor - inﬁltrating immune cells like macro - phages , granulocytes , and myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) . These can produce high amounts of immunosup - pressive mediators ( e . g . ROS or TGF b ) ( 123 , 124 ) . Given that coﬁlin is a direct target for ROS and oxidized coﬁlin mediates T - cell hyporesponsiveness or necrotic - like pro - grammed cell death ( 105 , 117 ) , this may be detrimental , since adaptive immunity against tumor cells is hindered . Myeloid cells regulate not only the redox milieu but also amino acid catabolism . Arginase I is an enzyme that hydrolyses arginine and induces arginine deprivation in the surrounding tissues . It is constitutively expressed in human neutrophils and is inducibly produced by MDSCs ( 157 , 158 ) . The physiological role of arginase I production and release is the balancing of immune responses to avoid exces - sive tissue destruction during inﬂammation ( e . g . pus induc - ing infections ) ( 159 ) . Too high arginase I activity can lead , however , to arginine deprivation , thereby provoking T cell hyporesponsiveness , for example , in tumor microenviron - ments ( 160 – 162 ) . We found that such an arginine depriva - tion in the environment of human T cells increases the amount of phosphorylated , inactive coﬁlin . Accordingly , immune synapse formation between T cells and APCs and the resulting T - cell activation are inhibited ( 163 ) . Notably , while polyclonal and antigen - speciﬁc proliferation of pan T cells are diminished , the antigen - speciﬁc cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells , which occurs through a different type of immune synapse , remains unaffected by arginine depriva - tion ( 164 ) . Potential role of coﬁlin in chronic inﬂammation / autoimmune diseases Whereas the relevance of coﬁlin for infectious and neoplas - tic diseases is without dispute , the evidence for an involve - ment of coﬁlin in chronic inﬂammatory / autoimmune disorders are in fact more indirect but conclusive . Notably , autoantibodies directed against coﬁlin have been found in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , polymyositis , dermatomyositis , and Behc (cid:1) et’s disease ( 165 ) . This ﬁnding implies a diagnostic and / or pathological role of coﬁlin in autoimmune diseases . More - over , the environmental control of coﬁlin activity could be an important key for the pathological onset or propagation of chronic inﬂammatory diseases . Thus , a knockout of p47phox disturbs activation of NADPH ( nicotinamide ade - nine dinucleotide phosphate ) oxidase and thus the oxidative burst in granulocytes . The p47phox knockout in mice or rats increases the severity of T cell - dependent but not of T cell - independent arthritis ( 166 , 167 ) . It is tempting to spec - ulate that a shift of the redox state of coﬁlin toward reduc - tion may be one molecular mechanism that leads to the pathological activation of T cells in the joints of these rodents . Notably , dephosphorylation / activation of coﬁlin is not blocked by cyclosporine A or FK506 , important immu - nosuppressive drugs targeting the serine phosphatase PP2B ( protein phosphatase 2B / calcineurin ) ( 81 ) . Other well - known immunosuppressive drugs for example , mycophenol - ic acid , leﬂunomide , dexamethasone , and rapamycin , also do not inﬂuence this signaling event . Therefore , enzymes regulating the activity of coﬁlin ( either directly or by inﬂu - encing the microenvironment ) may represent interesting novel targets for therapeutic immune modulation . Concluding remarks The widespread relevance of coﬁlin for T - cell activation and migration as well as its implications in different diseases suggest that pharmacological manipulation of the signaling pathways leading to coﬁlin activation or a cell type - speciﬁc inhibition of coﬁlin expression could provide effective means to improve the outcome of various dis - eases . Recently , an additional mode of coﬁlin regulation has been discovered : the redox regulation of coﬁlin ( 85 , 105 , 117 ) . It is independent of receptor triggering and cytokine functions and thus provides a previously unrecog - nized microenvironmental signal inﬂuencing T - cell - medi - ated immune responses . Therefore , we propose a ‘four signal model for T - cell activation’ ( Fig . 5 ) . The classical competence signal ( ﬁrst signal ) of T - cell activation is pro - vided by the peptide - MHC - complex ( pMHC ) and its recog - nition through the antigen - speciﬁc TCR / CD3 - complex . A second signal through costimulation of accessory receptors ( e . g . CD28 or CD2 ) is essential to avoid TCR - induced anergy . It induces coﬁlin dephosphorylation ( 37 ) and full T - cell activation ( 44 , 168 , 169 ) . The third signal is elicited through particular cytokine combinations , which are needed for the differentiation , development , and © 2013 The Authors .

Th1 , Th2 , or Th17 ) or cytotoxic T cells ( reviewed in 170 , 171 ) . The microenvi - ronmental regulation of T cells can be described , as a logi - cal extension of this concept , as a fourth or modulating signal for T - cell activation and function . Coﬁlin is a key molecule that senses alterations in the redox microenviron - ment as well as arginine deprivation and translates these signals into T - cell functions via its impact on actin dynam - ics . Notably , this fourth signal of T - cell activation and modulation is not only restricted to the activation of naive T cells in the lymphoid organs but also represents a modu - latory mechanism for T - cell - mediated immunity of naive and memory T cells in non - lymphoid organs and inﬂamed tissues . Future research should take this modulating fourth signal more into account to fully understand tissue - speciﬁc immune responses . References 1 . Angus KL , Grifﬁths GM .

T - cell costimulation via the TCR / CD3 complex ( competence or ﬁrst signal ) and costimulatory receptors ( progression or second signal ) is mandatory to induce coﬁlin dephosphorylation and full T - cell activation . Neither the ﬁrst nor second signal alone is sufﬁcient to provoke coﬁlin and T - cell activation . The third signal mediates T - cell differentiation via cytokines like IL - 12 . Effects on coﬁlin are as yet unknown . A fourth signal is provided by the microenvironment . This fourth signal has a modulating function that adapts T - cell responses to the conditions in the surrounding tissue . It can be activating ( e . g . reducing milieu ) or inhibiting ( e . g . oxidative milieu or arginine deprivation ) . © 2013 The Authors .
