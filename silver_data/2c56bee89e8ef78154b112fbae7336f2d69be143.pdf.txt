All experiments were performed in NRK cells stably expressing 4 ×λ N22 - 3 × mEGFP - M9 . The stable cell line was selected according to standard protocols and maintained in 0 , 5mg / ml G418 . For imaging , growth medium was replaced by CO 2 - independent phenol red free medium ( Invitrogen ) . Transfection was with FuGene 6 ( Roche ) . To promote movement of 4 ×λ N22 - 3 × mEGFP - M9 NRK cells transfected with p mRFP - 4 × boxB - β - actin - zipcode , 20 % FCS was added back after 4 hours of serum ( FCS ) starvation . DNA constructs An array of four λ N22 ( MDAQTRRRERRAEKQAQWKAAN ) , spaced by 21 amino acid linkers ( PPLDGAGAGAGAGAGAGGLAT ) , was fused to a tandem of three mEGFP 2 to increase the signal 3 , and followed by an M9 nuclear localization signal 4 . p Srprb - mRFP - 4 × boxB and p Srprb - mRFP - 16 × boxB were made the following way : mRFP 5 has been subcloned in place of CFP into p Srprb - CFP 3 . An oligonucleotide containing four boxB ( GCCCTGAAAAAGGGC ) spaced by four nucleotides and flanked by restriction sites was synthesized ( Sigma ) and subcloned downstream of mRFP stop codon . The total length of the stem loop tag was thus 80 nucleotides . Restriction sites 5’ and 3’ of this oligonucleotide were designed to subclone multiples of this array of four boxB motifs and used to generate a tag containing 16 boxB motifs , with a total length of 310 nucleotides . p mRFP - 4 / 16 × boxB - β - actin - zipcode were generated using the same oligonucleotide containing 4 boxB and the same strategy as for the previous construct . Chicken β - actin - zipcode was designed as construct G in 6 . The plasmid p5 × boxB - SRPRNA was constructed using the forty one nucleotides of the human SRP RNA promoter followed by 5 boxB , the SRP RNA sequence and PolIII terminator 7 . EGFP was replaced by mRFP in p SRP19 - EGFP 8 to generate p SRP19 - mRFP . Imaging Imaging was performed on a customized ZEISS LSM510 Axiovert confocal microscope as described previously 9 , 10 using a 63x Plan - Apochromat 1 . 4 NA oil immersion objective lens ( Carl Zeiss , Jena ) . Images were analyzed in the LSM software ( Carl Zeiss , Jena ) and ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Figures were assembled in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator ( Adobe Systems , Inc . ) . Image ratios were calculated by dividing background subtracted mRNA intensities by the corresponding background subtracted protein intensities . For display purposes , cell contours were defined by automated segmentation in the mRFP channel and applied to the ratio images . Ratio values at each pixel are displayed as warm colors for higher ratio and cold colors for lower ratio . For correlating post - mitotic mRNA export and encoded protein translation , quantitation during the first wave of cytoplasmic mRNA localization is displayed . Fluorescence intensities were background subtracted and normalized between 0 and 1 in the following manner . For mRNA , average cytoplasmic background of untransfected cells and highest values in the first wave where normalized to 0 and 1 . For protein , average cytoplasmic background of untransfected cells and highest values were set to 0 and 1 . Data from n = 6 cells have been registered in time to the highest mRNA value of the wave . Photobleaching was done on mRNA and protein molecules using the 488 nm line of the argon laser and the 561 nm diode laser simultaneously . Images were taken with wide open pinhole , fluorescence in the bleached region of the cytoplasm was background subtracted and corrected for bleaching due to acquisition and loss of total fluorescence due to the photobleach pulse and normalized to 1 for the prebleach intensity .
