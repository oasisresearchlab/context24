University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign | wagnert @ illinois . edu Fenlon , Katrina University of Maryland , USA | kfenlon @ umd . edu Sorensen , Amanda University of Maryland , USA | asorens1 @ umd ABSTRACT This paper explores the social and technical perceptions of physical and digital formats as they relate to work in the recovery and reuse of scientific data , specifically historical , archival , and defunct data sources . Proprietary and obsolete formats , or formats that need significant transformation work , stand out as central challenges for scientists and data curators who are recovering reusable data from archival or legacy data sources . The challenges confronting data sharing and reuse of contemporary scientific data are already known to be myriad ; formats often pose a major , compounding challenge to retrospective data curation research and practice . Based on 23 qualitative interviews with practitioners conducting data recovery and reuse , ranging from marine biologists to data librarians , we study how they understand , engage with , and utilize formats within their data curation work . This paper enumerates the formats deployed throughout the scientific data curation process and explores how practitioners creating and curating scientific data based on historical and archival materials encounter , make sense of , and utilize formats .

The paper concludes by with practical and theoretical implications of navigating formats within the recovery and reuse of scientific data and offers suggestions for reconfiguring formats within broader data curation lifecycles . KEYWORDS Formats ; data recovery ; data reuse ; scientific data ; sociotechnical issues INTRODUCTION Research and practice in the field of scientific data curation have provided a growing body of guidance and tools for sharing and reusing recent and future scientific data , but attention to retrospective practices of curating scientific data from historical or otherwise defunct materials has been relatively limited . This leaves in limbo untold masses of potentially valuable scientific evidence (cid:178) in archives , on hard drives in the basements of scientific labs , or in the papers of retired scientists , for example . Yet , these data have significant potential value to longitudinal and integrative data reuse , proven by a growing body of work on historical data reuse to support active scientific research in many fields ( Choudhury , 2017 ; Mayernik et al . , 2017 ; Pasquetto et al . , 2017 ; Thomer , 2022 . ) . The Recovering and Reusing Archival Data for Science project is investigating data recovery and reuse efforts that focus on legacy or historical data within a wide range of institutional , disciplinary , and research contexts , in particular to explore the distinctive challenges of curating data from legacy research sources as opposed to curating contemporary data . One central challenge that has emerged from interviews with scientists and curation professionals doing data recovery work lies in the material and digital formats of the data sources themselves . While contemporary curation work focuses on data that already exists as such , retrospective work often involves significant format conversions , including data extraction and transformation work . This paper explores this central challenge of data formats as a distinguishing factor between contemporary and retrospective data curation practices . Formats provide but one context for broader practices , trends , and challenges in the recovery and reuse of archival data . Across processes of recovering , reusing , and storing data , formats (cid:178) including the types and analog formats of physical media , as well as digital file formats or filetypes (cid:178) serve as surrogates for data , mediate between archival preservation and curatorial usability , and often offer proprietary hindrances to reuse across physical and digital contexts ( Rosenthal , 2010 ) . Not all formats are created equally . Some are designed to offer a long - term solution for preserving information ( Hodge & Anderson , 2007 ; Park & Oh , 2012 ) , whereas other formats function exclusively as conduit for documentation ( Pearson & Webb , 2008 ; Duretec & Becker , 2017 ) . The fluidity of formats only grows when working to differentiate between digital and physical , and the migration from analog to digital surrogates and from obsolete files to new digital files ( Sherring et al . , 2018 ) . Additionally , little is known about the range of places where scientific data recovery work happens and , by extension , the importance of scientific data recovery work more broadly , including the inevitable impact of formats on this work . In spite of clear calls for dealing with format obsolescence ( Casey , 2015 ) and advocacy to make format migration work within cultural heritage institutions more visible ( Lischer - Katz , 2019 ) , the sociotechnical role of formats in data recovery and reuse remains under - examined . ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 397 Long Papers This qualitative study utilizes findings from 23 interviews with practitioners conducting data recovery and reuse across disciplinary and organizational contexts . The overarching goal of this study is to identify common challenges for scientific data recovery and reuse across disciplines . However , one prominent theme that emerged in our findings was the wide variety of physical and digital formats with which scientists and data practitioners wrangle in the process of their recovery work . Therefore , this study focuses on a subset of our findings : on how participants discuss their perceptions of formats in the production and distribution of scientific data recovered from historical , archival , or defunct sources . First , this paper offers up an enumeration of format types across physical and digital scientific data contexts . Second , it offers insight into how practitioners identify their own curatorial expertise in relationship to formats , how practitioners contextualize the value of any given format , and what particular formats reveal about the sociotechnical issues informing institutional support of scientific data recovery and reuse . LITERATURE REVIEW Sociotechnical Issues in Digital Preservation / Curation There exist well - established concerns around the dire need for proactive digital preservation and curation within cultural heritage institutions ( Hedstrom , 1997 ) . Sociotechnical concerns regarding digital preservation and curation include several issues : identifying institutional preparedness for digital preservation workflows ( Ahmad & Rafig , 2022 ) ; planning for long - term preservation of web - based content ( Day , 2006 ) ; scaling institutional resources to assure digital sustainability ( Montoya , 2016 ) ; and assuring that materials include enough context to explore diverse and understudied histories ( Sheffield , 2016 ) . In spite of the variety of generative outcomes associated with planning for and implementing thorough methods for digital preservation and curation , institutional and stakeholder support remain limited if present at all ( Council on Library and information Resources , 2013 ; Poole , 2016 ) . In addition to the challenges associated with supporting digital preservation and curation , the perceived skills necessary for digital curation work often prove overly demanding and too technical for many practitioners ( Kim et al . , 2012 ) . Further , robust preparation for the needs of digital preservation and curation remain absent from curricular pedagogy , especially within library and information graduate programs ( Kim et al . , 2012 ; Sheffer & Hunker , 2019 ) . In response , solutions to addressing digital preservation and curation concerns range from seeking support from publishers and vendors ( Smit et al . , 2011 ; Narlock et al . , 2021 ) to collaborative consortia work aimed at offloading costs , labor , and expertise across institutions ( Trehub et al . , 2019 ) . Despite progress towards digital preservation and curation solutions , there still exists an abundance of content held in an equally abundant amount of formats . As a result , scholars have begun shifting focus to social practices of digital curation and preservation beyond institutions (cid:90)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:39)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:90)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:17) The continued rise of participatory digital ecosystems necessitates expansive considerations on the roles and responsibilities of digital preservation and curation . These shifts in participation require institutions and practitioners to reimagine how they understand their work and how we train individuals to identify , enact , and prioritize digital curation work ( Becker , 2018 ) . One response to this increased social responsibility includes open data and citizen data work , especially within the sciences ( Molloy , 2011 ; Purdham , 2014 ) . As a result , the obligations associated with allowing for open participation in data curation raise questions around usability and barriers to access which , as will be discussed , surface questions around uniform , long term accessible file formats ( Juell - Skielse et al . , 2014 ) . In addition to making curation work more open and collaborative , shifts in focus include valuing and prioritizing community - based data curation and understanding legitimate community choices to keep their own data outside of institutional settings ( Curry et al . , 2010 ; Dallas , 2016 ; Gupta et al . , 2023 ) . Additionally , awareness of uneven institutional support and infrastructures for digital curation paired with many different community needs for data has resulted in a shift towards valuing both professional and amateur labor in the digital preservation and curation processes across physical and born - digital (cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:11)(cid:38)(cid:82)(cid:91)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:19)(cid:28)(cid:30)(cid:3)(cid:50)(cid:182)(cid:49)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:26)(cid:12)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:86)(cid:3) amateur and community digital curation work opens up venues that provide methods for both institutional , content building vis - a - vis something like the National Archives and Records Administration ' s Citizen Archivist project ( Liu , 2021 ) . Formats and Data Curation The rise in digital librarianship and the responsibilities by libraries to curate both digitized and born - digital data increased concerns about both format and technological obsolescence issues and the perceived role of information institutions and their staff members ( Yadav , 2016 ) . For academic libraries format migration represents a sliver of a broader digital curation environment , which already suffers from a lack of technical expertise and infrastructural support for relevant training on contemporary formating needs , let alone the identifying , preserving , digitizing , and migrating obsolete formats ( Rahman , 2020 ) . Additionally , both institutional and community archives face quandaries with attending to obsolete formats , often having to offer reactive migration solutions when attending to obsolete formats , which range from transferring information from one unstable format to another rather than identifying long term preservation solutions . Further , the aforementioned lack of support both in terms of labor and resources results in archives often prioritizing rare or valuable materials at the expense of seemingly mundane or ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 398 Long Papers arbitrary materials ( Baker & Collins , 2017 ) . Despite both the scientific and humanities disciplines understanding the value of data stored on obsolete formats , most institutions sorely underutilize these collections , again centering preservation and migration efforts towards more high - profile materials and collections such as rare books and manuscripts ( Ordelman et al . , 2019 ) . Scholars argue that part of the reason valuable data takes precedent over the uniqueness and complexity of formats often has more to do with the expertise to use data production tools , broader access to technologies in producing information , and infrastructure to hold and treat equal all formats ( Jancovic et al . , 2019 ) . As such , the obligations for format preservation and the curation of data associated with these formats became a dispersed endeavor . For example , in the case of preserving formats associated with sound recordings , work toward the restoration of older formats ( i . e . , a vinyl record ) co - occurred with digital preservation efforts that preserved copies , alongside access copies ( Canazza , 2012 ) . Alternatively , when dealing with formats that are both physical and in need of digitization , and formats that are born - digital and in need of quality checks and reformatting ( i . e . , proprietary time - based media ) the utilization of microservices , such as digitization vendors , takes precedence over internal solutions ( Rice and Schweiker , 2019 ) . Materials held on obsolete formats , which represent marginalized groups advocating for material repatriation can also force institutions to address migration and preservation , as occurs within Indigenous work around media sovereignty and ceding control back to tribes and their affiliates ( Ginsburg , 2016 ) . In turn , distributed networks of institutions , communities , and divergent and overlapping stakeholders result in a variety of approaches . Indeed , methods of preservation at the cross - organizational level provide useful methods for format specific endeavors , ranging from physical film heritage preservation ( Antoniazzi , 2021 ) to preparing for ingesting and curating born - digital three - dimensional and augmented reality data ( Hall et al . , 2019 ) . Recovery and Reuse of Scientific Data The past two decades have witnessed the rapid advancement of research and practice in scientific data curation , as the potential public value of shared research data has gained widespread recognition among a range of stakeholders , including scientists , data managers , funders , etc . The proliferation of sociotechnical infrastructures for supporting data curation and reuse (cid:178) ranging from federal open access mandates to data repositories , from credentialing programs on best practices guidelines , such as the FAIR and CARE principles ( Wilkinson et al . 2016 ; Carroll et al . 2020 ) (cid:178) has largely focused on making interventions in the sharing and reuse of current and future scientific data . The vast accumulation of historic data records (cid:178) or , still more vast body of historic artifacts , documents , specimens , and other sources of scientific evidence containing potential data (cid:178) has gone largely unrecognized by the data curation field . Relatively little empirical research has addressed the recovery and reuse of scientific data from historical or otherwise defunct sources , despite the proven value of these data for supporting active and ongoing scientific research . Historical data demonstrably support longitudinal and meta - analyses , computational modeling , and cross - disciplinary research in various domains ( Wyborn et al . , 2015 ) , including ecological and climate research ( e . g . , Specht et al . , 2018 ; Brunet & Jones , 2011 ) ; oceanography and earth sciences ( e . g . , Fallas et al . , 2015 ; Hsu et al . , 2015 ) ; archaeology ( e . g . , Kansa & Kansa , 2022 ; Faniel et al . , 2013 ) ; astronomy ( e . g . , Borgman & Wofford , 2021 ) ; and biological sciences , health , and medicine ( Wolinetz & Collins 2020 ; McKeown et al . 2021 ; Meystre et al . 2017 ) . Scientists recover historical and otherwise defunct data to serve a broad range of research purposes . Pasquetto et al . ( 2017 ) offer distinctions among different kinds of data reuse : reuse to serve the reproducibility or replication of research outcomes ; independent reuse , targeting fundamentally novel questions ; and integrative reuse , which combines data from multiple sources to serve comparisons , new models , or new research questions altogether . Historical data reuse practices may exemplify any of these categories . (cid:58)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3) from digital or analog sources ( of many kinds ) that have been compromised by any number of factors , including natural disasters , political or organizational shifts , technological decay , obsolescence , and gradual obscurity ( Wyborn et al . , 2015 ) . These data may lie in handwritten tables within the papers of a retired scientist , lying unprocessed in the basement of an archive . They may live on the disappearing web pages of a governmental research agency during a shift in political administrations ( as in the Data Refuge initiative (cid:177) see Janz , 2018 ) . They may have been lost to time , their traces only visible in published , visualized charts and graphs that reference source numbers that have evaporated . They may be buried in inaccessible file formats on a defunct harddrive (cid:178) or , in contrast , they might be eminently accessible from a technical perspective but unusable due to uncertainty around intellectual property constraints . Data curation as a field is concerned with making and keeping data accessible for lifecycles of use and reuse over time , including practices and processes such as data sharing , data citation and evaluation , documentation , description , and preservation ( Cragin et al . , 2010 ; Higgins 2008 ; Vearncombe et al . 2017 ) . Within this broader field , data recovery emphasizes aspects of curation applied to data no longer in use , or data that are not usable : data that are at imminent risk of being lost , data that are not usable as such , and data from the past . In many cases , data being ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 399 Long Papers subject to data recovery were never shared as such , or never intended for broad distribution or open - ended reuse , and therefore lacking documentation , computational amenability , and critical context . Mayernik et al . ( 2020 ) offer a matrix for understanding the risk factors facing research data , including losses of funding , losses of contextual knowledge , catastrophes , changes in legal status or ownership , and cybersecurity breaches . Even for data in current use , or data living in preservation repositories , the challenges facing their endurance are significant . Historical or otherwise defunct data face the same challenges , but compounded by the passage of time , separation from original creators and contexts , technological deterioration , software obsolescence , and more . Data recovery is invariably resource - intensive . It often entails manual workflows , involving aspects of contextual research , digital - forensic work , digitization , transcription , and other significant interpretive and analytic work . Because of scale and manual labor , the most highly visible and scalable projects come from crowdsourcing ( e . g . , Eveleigh et al . , 2014 ) . Data recovery also often requires networks of collaboration , and relies on specialized skills that are not widely held , whether among scientists or data curators ( Griffin , 2015 ) . Moreover , the process of data recovery may raise new ethical considerations for the welfare of human subjects represented in data , or for communities whose sensitive knowledges may be represented in historical data sources . While the overwhelming focus of data curation research and practice are on contemporary and future data , there are important strands of work that have made significant headway on data recovery and data rescue , including but not limited to the Research Data Alliance Data Rescue Interest Group and the CODATA Data - at - Risk Task Group . The prior work in this vein has characterized endemic challenges to data recovery and reuse from at - risk sources , and identified opportunities for support from libraries as well as the necessity of cross - institutional collaboration ( Murillo , 2014 ; Choudhury , 2017 ; Mayernik et al . , 2017 ) . METHODS The objective of this research was to uncover both shared and distinctive practices among data recovery practitioners in diverse institutional and research contexts . Interviews were conducted to examine case studies involving the retrieval of analog data , such as scientific formulas written by hand , and born - digital data that often existed in outdated file formats . After presenting the case studies to researchers in different agricultural subdisciplines and realizing that recovery practices were more prevalent than previously thought , the scope of the study was expanded to encompass information practices across disciplines among scientists and curators involved in data recovery work . The research presented here focuses specifically on a subset of questions related to the role of formats in their curatorial work , for a more expansive explanation of topics and findings see ( Sorensen et al . , 2023 ) . Following IRB approval , the research team engaged in 23 semi - structured interviews with practitioners across the scientific data curation landscape including : archivist , scientists , librarians , scholars , and individuals working in institutional capacities adjacent to scientific data curation such as museums , crowdsourcing endeavors , and observatories . Questions engaged participants in topics related to their experiences with scientific data curation , methods and tools for evaluating and identifying recovery worth data , procedures for recovering data , and challenges that emerged in their work . Of particular focus for this paper are questions related to the challenges and experiences working with formats in the recovery and reuse of scientific data . Interviews ran for approximately an hour and with the permission of participants were audio recorded . Upon transcription all audio recordings were deleted . A codebook was constructed emically by identifying key themes drawn from participant discussions ( Guba & Lincoln , 1994 ) . Figure 1 represents the sample code , definition for Formats , as well as a relevant quote . Formats Particular formats , file formats , documentation practices or policies , metadata standards ( formal or informal ) , or other facets of representation and description .

Sample of Formats code used in analysis In order to ensure validity , the team engaged in constant comparative coding to achieve intercoder reliability ( Boeije , 2002 ) . Emergent topics arose during coding meetings , the team examined these topics , built new codes , and reapplied additional codes accordingly . All participants were assigned a unique identifier ( e . g . , P01 ) to ensure anonymity . Additionally , when necessary , we have redacted personally identifiable information from transcripts . FINDINGS The findings enumerate the format types present within scientific data curation . This enumeration , while not a quantification of all potential formats , nonetheless provides insight into how scientists and the curators understand physical , digitized , and born - digital formats within the sciences , and what degrees of data structuration exist across these formats . The range of formats from which scientists and curation practitioners are conducting data recovery is striking , and necessitates in turn a wide range of transformational practices in the process of recovery . The findings ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 400 Long Papers also explore the sociocultural factors that inform the navigation of formats within scientific data curation , highlighting issues surrounding the role of practitioner expertise in curation across formats , the impact of perceived informational value as a context for engaging with potentially challenging or obsolete formats in data curation work , (cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:78)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3) within recovery and reusing scientific data . Of the 23 participants , who ranged on a spectrum from scientists to data curation professionals ( many of whom have joint expertise in a domain science as well as in data curation ) , 7 may be (cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:17)(cid:3) Enumerating Format Types Broadly speaking , formats often fell into one of three categories . Formats were either physical ( i . e . , handwritten notes ) , digitized from a physical origin ( i . e . , scans of microfilm ) , or born - digital objects ( i . e . , 3D data models ) . Not all formats easily fit this distinction , of cour (cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:243)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3) files , but their physicality and need for relational hardware make their relationship to the constraints of physical formats more prominent . Equally , not all formats discussed by participants neatly map onto a linear understanding of the physical format to digitized format workflow . Participants identified , for example , the presence of printed emails , webpages , and other born - digital documents as part of their navigation of formats , often raising questions about the origin and location of the born - digital originals . Participants also treated file formats as equivalent to physical formats , discussing their structure , usability , and even obsolescence in similar terms . Examples of file formats discussed ranged from basic data files ( i . e . , . CSV ) to structured digital objects ( i . e . , . JPEG ) as well as more complex digital objects related to scientific research , such as . DICOM files which represent a format used extensively in the production of computerized tomography ( CT ) scans . Perhaps most unique within the framing of formats by scientists and scientific data curators were the treating of physically occurring objects as a format type . Given that scientific disciplines such as geology and archaeology rely on natural objects , multiple participants identified rocks and fossils as a format type in their work . Practitioners working with scientific data enumerated formats across a landscape of structured and unstructured data . Unstructured data often emerged at the creation or ingestion phase of recovery and reuse work and included physical formats ( i . e . , handwritten notes ) as well as unstructured digital data such as digital photographs from archaeological sites . Formats discussed also included both physical and digital semi - structured data such as handwritten logbooks and . TSV files with unique tabulations and multifaceted relationship between data points . In terms of structured data , physical formats included discussions of objects like punch cards used in computer processing , whereas highly structured born - digital formats represented automated data gathering via technologies such as satellites and barometric tools . As with distinctions between physical and digital formats , the categories of unstructured , semi - structured , and structured believe how many formats rest upon particular relationships to other software , hardware , and related elements . For example , participants discussed working with Apple Hypercards and other storage devices , which relied on proprietary software only retrievable through emulation . As such , while practitioners can view data stored on these devices , it is often impossible to open the files , leaving the practitioners to do interpretive work not dissimilar to their engagements with unstructured data . While exhaustively listing each format is beyond the scope and space of this paper , the following chart provides a range of format types and structuration [ Figure 2 ] . Figure 2 . Formats based on their degrees of structuration and proximity to being physical or born - digital ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 401 Long Papers While the metrics for the graph are arbitrary , locations represent the degree to which an object falls on two axes : on the horizontal axis , ranging from physical to inherently digital or born - digital ; and , on the vertical axis , how (cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:37)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:15)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3) formal structures of data contained by or derived from the source .

For most items on this chart the distinctions are clear . A specimen , for example , is both incredibly unstructured as data and wholly physical , placing it squarely on the bottom left of the chart , whereas biometric data is both incredibly structured and entirely digital placing it in the top right corner of the chart . Some objects remain more complex , such as a CD - ROM whose content may include structured data , but the requirements of additional hardware and software to open it cause it to remain unstructured and somewhere between purely physical and purely digital format . Alternatively , photographic images exist between the physical and the digital depending on their mode of production , however , all require the same degree of interpretive data making them low on the y - axis ( unstructured ) and somewhere near the middle of the x - axis ( physical or digital ) . We acknowledge that some of these categorizations are debatable , but have done our best to reflect the unique ways that practitioners working in scientific data recovery and reuse understand these formats . Embodied Knowledge and Format Expertise Practitioners often framed format expertise as part of an embodied knowledge that comes with the territory of scientific data curation . Participants would often evoke a specific format and connect it directly to a historical moment in scientific data curation . P01 , a data curator at a national library , in acknowledging changes between contemporary born - digital file formats , noted having had to use CDs in their own prior preservation work , (cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:79) d database files , we , we used to just put out a CD ROM , (cid:92)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:92)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:78)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:75)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:38)(cid:39)(cid:3)(cid:53)(cid:50)(cid:48)(cid:86)(cid:17)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3) researchers on this project , who are likely only a generation removed in age , would be completely unaware of the role a format played in the daily storing and distributing of data . P13 , an information science professor , signaled their own relationship to obsolete formats as an inherent challenge learning to prioritize good digital curation practices du (cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:10)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:62)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:64)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:3) (cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:83)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:78)(cid:17)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:20)(cid:22)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:93)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3) value of migrating data whenever possible and to assure that proper documentation exists external to a format should someone need a sense of what data resides on a format relying other hardware and software to open . P04 , a historian of science , exposes how embodied knowledge can actually serve as a deterrent to innovating on modernized approaches to scientific data curation stating : I actually was supposed to do a project when I was an undergraduate , using punch cards , that was in 1985 or so , 86 . But then I just like , there ' s no way of doing this . I just told the professor ; I ' m just going to take these cards and migrate them to something reasonable . So I took him to the computer center , back when we had computer centers . And they turned on the IBM machine and shuffled all the cards and transferred it all into a prime system . I think it was so and I ' m like , I ' m very happy . I did my research project using the prime version of the data that I gave him back his giant box of cards I was supposed to use along with the digital data . For P04 , their expertise ran a (cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3) format , potentially exposing other instances in which physical formats were in need of digitization . P04 , however , also admitted having to confront their own preferred format and migration preferences . Specifically , P04 recalled doing digital imaging work prior to the rise of cheaply available multi - terabyte storage and holding off for far too long before investing in the storage mechanism , assuming it to be costly and an inefficient long term solution .

Finally , an additional finding related to experiential knowledge and its impact on scientific data curation work ties to having training directly connected to format use , curation , and preservation . Recollecting again their own learning about the challenge of scientific data via the curatorial challenges of a floppy disk , P13 , an information science professor , acknowledge that : Had I not been working in a geochemistry lab , I wouldn ' t have had the ability to recreate that and rerun a portion of the experiment to double check to make sure that , that the larger data set was correct . So and ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 402 Long Papers that comes back to the comment from earlier , the most precious data is that data that cannot be recreated in that way .

P07 , an information science professor , who also teaches courses in digital curation , acknowledges the challenges of incorporating this type of format migration a (cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:93)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:44)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:44)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3) digital curation teacher .

As we will discuss in the upcoming finding , this type of contextualization proves deeply important to navigating and prioritizing certain formats in scientific data recovery and reuse . P16 , a historian of science , connects contemporary born - digital format knowledge with broader historical scientific data curation knowledges and the boons and hindrances of each paradigm in scientific data curation by reflecting : So I think there ' s like a little bit of inherent mystery to some kinds of born - digital research , as a researcher , and th (cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:71)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:84)(cid:88)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:78)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:10)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:73)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:171)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:10)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3) age of born - digital acquisitions that we ' re already moving out of .

Informational Values of Formats are Contextual Participants perceived various formats within the recovery and reuse of scientific data to prove either context - rich or context - void , which often informed how they went about prioritizing or steering clear of particular formats . Indeed , P16 , whose previous discussion regarding the lack of mystery in receiving a hard drive from a research , notes that born - digital files , especially those related to proprietary software always come with contextual hindrances .

Though P16 does not explicitly state a file format during their discussion , it likely echoes a concern raised by multiple participants around proprietary database software , which often remain inoperable as anything other than .

Participants like P17 , a data librarian , identified formats that could be deeply rich contextual resources , but seem contextually challenging due to their size and scope .

In response to their own concession that the logbooks are contextually massive , P17 approaches sharing out the logbooks in smaller formats such as single document files or reports , which they then share across social media as a way to both encourage use and alleviate the contextual barrier of information overload . When navigating the question of context within born - digital formats , multiple participants argued that a combination of good preservation workflows and intentional file - level metadata could help to enrich the context of a format . In the case of P05 , a data science librarian , they identify codebooks as a format whose contextual richness occurs (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:74)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:93)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:15)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:17)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:19)(cid:24)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:78)(cid:86)(cid:3) often include things like the creator of the code , geographic location , and guidelines on how to interpret codes means that the format often invites use and reuse through ease of design . Alternatively , P11 , an information science professor , identifies their own role in helping to assure context - richness within geo - located data observing : (cid:179)(cid:62)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:64)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:82) - located , it ' s time stamped , it is validated , there ' s historical models to run it against it is , it is absence / presence - based so you can use it for more things because absence is implied as long as I say (cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:10)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:180) For P11 , not only is the database in question richly contextualized in terms of how data were gathered , its association with a university - funded project and its crowdsourcing through scientific knowledge generation , affirm its contextual richness as authoritative . In contrast , P05 ( data science librarian ) , argued that their engagement with codebooks , while context - rich , held no explicit a tie to co - production , which raised questions about the validity of the data generated and its potential for reuse . While both examples refer to born - digital documents , a physical (cid:72)(cid:84)(cid:88)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:20)(cid:24)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:93)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:86)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3) help provide context to otherwise physical formats with minimal contextual access points . Formats Expose Broader Sociotechnical Issues within Scientific Data Curation Given that format digitization and migration occur within larger ecosystems and , as suggested by the literature , often remain under - supported by institutional stakeholders , dealing with the complexities of formats for some practitioners occurred in response to the demands of broader social influences . In the case of P14 ( archivist ) , their organi (cid:93)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:75)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:78)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:87)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:87)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:83)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3) turn , required that they do away with software used in emulating obsolete formats . Of the need to move away from obsolete file formats , P14 said : This is purely an infrastructure issue and a tracking of concerns about security , concerns about being able to track the machines . So we have this tension where we can ' t , you know , these obsolete software will not pass security review , in many cases , but we need the software in order to emulate the content . So we ' re trying to work through if we can , or the OCIO ( Office of the Chief Information Officer ) was trying to work through where and how they could set up a server that could do all of the many things that we needed to do . . . For P14 and their institution , grappling with format relevance occurred through broader sociotechnical demands around cybersecurity , which necessitated altering digital file standards as a safety precaution . Fortunately , P14 utilized the opportunity to create a solution for longer term preservation tied to dedicated server space . Other participants such as P15 exposed sociotechnical barriers to their ability to engage with the best practices of format migration , in response to external regulations on how and where governmental organizations could spend money . In needing to attain obsolete hardware for format digitization P14 recollected : I had to purchase some of the necessary programs to provide access .

Where P14 noted institutional barriers to digitization and migration work in scientific data reuse , P22 interrogates broader social relationships to data production that remain concerned with advances or moments in which (cid:179)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:74)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:73)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:75)(cid:15)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:87) - sinking initiatives and lead to d (cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:92)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:82)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:69)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3) elsewhere . P22 surfaces an unspoken sociotechnical perception of older formats wherein their data is likely available elsewhere and therefore checking becomes counterproductive , despite acknowledgements by other practitioners of hidden contextual value across older format types . Older formats in this framing are simply useless technologies , both in their physical , digital , and potentially even born - digital iterations . To borrow from P16 in what can only be described as a knowingly apocryphal statement , sociotechnical systems and their perceived relationship to formats within scientific curation lifecycles refuse to address the destruction of formats leading to situations where once (cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:78)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:3)(cid:62)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:92)(cid:182)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:64)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:78)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:17)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:58)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3) experiences with formats in the recovery and reuse of scientific data inform digital curation work moving forward . DISCUSSION Theoretical Implications For the participants of this study , there exists a thin line between format - based data that once existed as data as opposed to data lurking within formats related to scientific evidence ( specimens , samples , artifacts , documents ) that are not yet data . While this distinction should produce a clean binary between data types , the formats encountered and engaged with by participants cut across both contexts creating blurred distinctions between each . In particular , data held across formats become beholden to their immediacy of usability . Formats whose data is easily usable ( i . e . , retrievable ) tend to take precedent in popular curatorial practices . Generally speaking , this means that a born - digital file is presumed to be the most contextually rich resource . While participants certainly acknowledged instances wherein physical preferences dismissed the need for digital surrogates , the centering of digital formats remained a preferred value . Such preferences , however , betrayed larger curatorial practices relational to format migration and sustainability when an overreliance on a particular type of digital format or standard faced proprietary - based challenges ( i . e . , discontinuing a database design software ) or shifts in institutional thinking around data privacy ( i . e . , the removal of compromisable software from desktops integral to using a particular file format ) . In each instance the need for access to an older , albeit obsolete format with the same data , could have helped data recovery . Given the realities that many types of data , not just those associated with scientific research , exist only on outdated formats , a shift towards centering challenging formats within this work proves paramount . Formats prone to degradation such as magnetic media do require unique digitization priorities , but as our participants observed older formats can be data rich in unanticipated ways meaning that questions about how we identify sustainability in current format creation and migration can best be understood by looking towards what remains accessible and reusable on older formats . In many ways attending to obsolescence is an act of sustainability , and enacting sustainability means accounting for all possible forms of obsolescence moving forward . In an extension of a somewhat radical take on the archival mantra Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe ( LOCKSS ) allowing for some presence of outdated formats and their data to retain a presence in scientific data recovery and reuse helps to keep stuff sustainably safe . Practical Implications Retrospective data curation work necessitates significant transformational work (cid:178) often highly labor - intensive , and demanding scientific domain expertise (cid:178) on a strikingly broad range of material and digital sources of evidence . Practitioner responses to the role of formats in their daily work most clearly highlights a well - identified need for more meaningful investments in navigating formats and their contextual challenges across curation ecosystems . Whether it be antiquated rules for how to obtain obsolete hardware or older practitioners refusing to adapt to digital migration demands , the scientists and data curators in this study remain keenly aware of the need for broader ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 405 Long Papers investment in changing goals . As P14 observed , a top - down policy can force immediate , albeit drastic , changes in curatorial practice , but such opportunities when properly leveraged can become sites for negotiating support for format migration , preservation , and curation training . A potential solution to addressing many of these challenges might come from policies which require public facing institutions to run audits of their format holdings . These audits can ask not only for an enumeration of what formats exist within archival and research holdings , but further contexts for what data resides on these formats . Such initiatives would result in proactive rather than reactive response to format concerns and curatorial needs . Given the well - chronicled gaps in digital curation knowledge amongst emerging information science professionals , utilizing more focused and impactful fellowships and internships aimed at identifying and addressing format - based curation needs both within and outside of the sciences . Such initiatives might help raise awareness and even alleviate issues regarding format migration and conversion within scientific data curation lifecycles . CONCLUSION The use of formats in the recovery and reuse of scientific data remains a vastly complex undertaking which brings to light various challenges and opportunities to extend questions about format obsolescence , data sources , and informational contexts in data recovery work . Formats function as proxies , impediments , and even linkages between sustained preservation and curatorial reusability . The fluidity of formats is further complicated by the differentiation between digital and physical formats , and the varying degrees with which the data held on those formats possess meaningful structure . Despite the importance of addressing format - based challenges such as obsolescence and accounting for format migration work within cultural heritage institutions , there remains much to understand regarding the sociotechnical role of formats in scientific data curation . Through interviews with practitioners across the scientific data recovery and reuse lifecycle , this paper provides insight into how practitioners perceive formats in relation to the production and distribution of scientific data . Though providing enumeration around formats present within scientific data curation , alongside identifying the importance of experiential knowledge , informational contexts , and sociotechnical influences of format prevalence , this paper illuminates the oft - overlooked potential of formats to expand rather than limit the possibilities of scientific data recovery and reuse . While formats will likely remain sites of instability within data curation lifecycles , the practitioners interviewed remind us that we should think twice before tossing that old hard , as it may well hold within it a data value waiting to be revived .
