A key aspect of the vitamin A - redox hypothesis , applicable to both yellow and red coloration , is the hypothesized negative feedback of tightly regulated Vitamin A plasma levels on the enzyme responsible for sequestering both Vitamin A and carotenoids from the gut . We performed a meta - analysis and ﬁnd that vitamin A levels are posi - tively related to carotenoid plasma levels ( r = 0 . 50 , P = 0 . 0002 ) . On the basis of this ﬁnding and further theoretical considerations , we propose that the vitamin A - redox hypothesis is unlikely to explain carotenoid - dependent honest signaling . Introduction Carotenoid - dependent traits are found throughout the ani - mal kingdom and are especially ubiquitous in birds . The color intensity of these traits is presumed to honestly signal phenotypic quality ( Alonso - (cid:1) Alvarez and Galv (cid:1) an 2011 ; Si - mons et al . 2012a ) , and female choice for these traits has been demonstrated ( e . g . , Simons and Verhulst 2011 ; Too - mey and McGraw 2012 ) . Carotenoid - dependent traits have been hypothesized to signal oxidative stress state and immunocompetence , because of carotenoids’ alleged anti - oxidant ( von Schantz et al . 1999 ) and immune - enhancing properties ( Lozano 1994 ) . There is evidence for both these hypotheses , yet effect sizes are low , suggesting that there could be additional honesty maintaining mechanisms operating ( Svensson and Wong 2011 ; Simons et al . 2012b ) . The Vitamin A - redox hypothesis provides such an alternative mechanism ( Hill and Johnson 2012 ) . The vitamin A - redox hypothesis is based on the con - straints imposed by vitamin A regulation and its shared biochemical pathways with carotenoids . Hill and Johnson built upon the physiological actions of vitamin A , which are deeply rooted into physiology , and hypothesize that these physiological actions might therefore maintain hon - esty of carotenoid - dependent signals . For instance , vitamin A regulates intracellular signaling involved in for example early development and B lymphocyte activation . Vitamin A does so by acting as a transcriptional activator across the genome . More speciﬁcally , all - trans retinoic acid , a product derived from vitamin A , drives transcription in a redox - dependent manner . Hill and Johnson argued that carotenoid uptake and metabolism are impaired when vitamin A homeostasis is compromised , rendering carot - enoid - dependent traits honest signals of condition . The thorough biochemical background of vitamin A , carote - noids and their connections outlined by Hill & Johnson 224 ª 2014 The Authors . Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd .

We explored whether the vitamin A - redox hypothesis can explain carotenoid - dependent signal honesty by focusing on one key aspect of the hypothesis , negative feedback of vitamin A levels on carotenoid uptake , which is the proposed mechanism by which disturbances in vita - min A homeostasis can disrupt carotenoid uptake . This key biochemical constraint assumed in the vitamin A - redox hypothesis ( Hill and Johnson 2012 ) , that is applicable to both yellow and red carotenoid - dependent coloration , is that pro - vitamin A carotenoids and , impor - tantly , also other carotenoids ( more commonly used in coloration than pro - vitamin A carotenoids ) are taken up by the same protein in the gut , SR - B1 , and that BCMO1 converts pro - vitamin A carotenoids to vitamin A . Vita - min A homeostasis is ( in part ) regulated by negative feed - back of retinoid acid on BCMO1 and SR - B1 . Hill and Johnson hypothesized that this negative feedback links the vitamin A pool and thus vitamin A homeostasis , to carot - enoid uptake and availability for its use in trait pigmenta - tion ( Fig . 1 ) , and thereby ensures signal honesty . Note that knowledge of these feedbacks is largely based on research in mammals , and were assumed by Hill and Johnson to be similar in birds because they are suppos - edly evolutionary conserved . However , whether these feedback mechanisms do indeed operate similarly in birds and mammals remain to be veriﬁed . With this caveat in mind , we can however evaluate aspects of the vitamin A - redox hypothesis . Because of the presumed negative feed - back ( Fig . 1 ) of vitamin A levels on carotenoid uptake , vitamin A levels may be either ( 1 ) negatively related with carotenoid levels if negative feedback is sufﬁciently strong as assumed in the vitamin A - redox hypothesis , or it may ( 2 ) decouple carotenoid levels from vitamin A lev - els , because vitamin A homeostasis is maintained and the carotenoid pool reﬂects perturbations in vitamin A homeostasis via negative feedback on carotenoid uptake or ( 3 ) If negative feedback is not sufﬁciently strong , vita - min A and carotenoid may be positively related if they covary in the diet or for other physiological reasons not related to sexual signaling . The latter ﬁnding would falsify a key aspect of the Vitamin A - redox hypothesis , in that the postulated processes may still occur , but are appar - ently overridden by other processes making their net effect negligible in the context of honest signaling . Such processes could for example be between - individual varia - tion in quality resulting in differences in the ability to maintain vitamin A homeostasis or the ability to bear the handicap of reduced vitamin A homeostasis – also gener - ating a positive relationship between vitamin A , carote - noids and associated sexual signaling . In humans in which SBR1 , BCMO1 negative feedback has been well conﬁrmed , a positive correlation between retinol and car - otenoids is still apparent ( Russell - Briefel et al . 1985 ; Schunemann et al . 2001 ) , suggesting that between - indi - vidual variation in retinol and carotenoid levels is more important than the negative feedback via BCMO1 and SRB1 . Methods To distinguish between these three options , we gathered all available data on the relationship between vitamin A ( speciﬁcally retinol ) and carotenoid plasma levels in adult birds and subjected these to a meta - analysis . We searched the literature using Google Scholar with the following search terms ( with the last search in August 2014 ) : vita - min A , retinol , carotenoids , birds , and contacted authors of the eligible papers if the correlation was not directly reported , but vitamin A and carotenoid levels were reported . We retrieved observational data from six species of birds ( Blount et al . 2003 ; H ~ orak et al . 2004 ; Larcombe et al . 2008 ; Arnold et al . 2010 ; Martinez - Haro et al . 2011 ) , and with the exception of two studies ( H ~ orak et al . 2004 ; Martinez - Haro et al . 2011 ) , that were conducted on captive birds . From three additional eligible publications , we failed to obtained the data ( Møller et al . 2005 ; Navar - ro et al . 2010 ; Giraudeau and McGraw 2014 ) . All studies employed high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) as measurement technique , ruling out cross - reac - tivity causing spurious correlations . We could however not distinguish between types of carotenoids and although this should generally be preferred ( McGraw 2006 ) , total carotenoid plasma content correlates strongly to carotenoid - dependent signal expression across species ( Simons et al . 2012b ) . Random - effect meta - analyses were Figure 1 . The negative feedback of vitamin A levels on carotenoid uptake via retinoid acid according to Hill and Johnson ( 2012 ) . SR - B1 takes up carotenoids ( pro - vitamin A carotenoids and carotenoids ) and vitamin A from the gut and BCMO1 convert pro - vitamin A carotenoids to vitamin A . Negative feedback from the vitamin A pool regulated by retinoid acid regulates uptake from the gut to maintain vitamin A homeostasis . ª 2014 The Authors . Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . 225 M . J . P . Simons et al . Vitamin A and Signal Honesty performed using metafor ( Viechtbauer 2010 ) in R ( R Development Core Team 2011 ) . Results All studies showed a positive correlation between carote - noids and retinol , which was overall highly signiﬁcant ( r = 0 . 50 , P = 0 . 0002 ; Fig . 2 ; without apparent publica - tion bias : rank test , P = 0 . 36 and funnel plot inspection ) . This suggests that the negative feedback of vitamin A levels on carotenoid uptake is not sufﬁciently strong to constrain carotenoid uptake in order to render caroten - oid - dependent signal honest . Although the sample size of the meta - analysis is relatively small , patterns are consis - tent across studies ( Fig . 2 ) , increasing our conﬁdence in the overall estimate . Note also that whether the species exhibited a carotenoid - dependent trait as an adult ( Taeni - opygia guttata , Parus major and Anas platyrynchos ) or not did not affect the overall correlation when tested as a moderator ( Q = 0 . 49 , P = 0 . 48 ) . First , pooling across Melopsittacus undulates across the two separate studies included also did not change any of the conclusions . Discussion Our meta - analysis , although relatively low on sample size , but showing a very consistent overall effect , is to our best knowledge the ﬁrst test of a key aspect of the vitamin A - redox hypothesis . Because this hypothesis currently lacks any in vivo support in birds , our ﬁndings challenge the validity of the vitamin A - redox hypothesis in general , warranting a further critical review of this hypothesis . In addition to our empirical ﬁnding , there are also theoreti - cal reasons to doubt the explanatory power of the vitamin A - redox hypothesis . In general , it is debatable whether shared biochemical pathways can maintain honesty by providing a physiological evolutionary constraint ( Arnold 1992 ) in the face of sufﬁciently strong sexual selection . A biochemical constraint becomes unlikely if it can be overcome by stepwise pathway evolution . Here , we explore qualitatively , possible mutations that allow cheat - ing of the constraint mechanism proposed by Hill and Johnson , if it were to operate . If a mutation would arise that causes SR - B1 to be less sensitive to retinoid acid , it will increase sexual coloration inducing the cost of a decrease in vitamin A homeostasis , because the balance in negative feedback between BCMO1 and SR - B1 is altered . This mutant is now outcompeting its rivals with superior sexual coloration , acting as a handicap signal of vitamin A homeostasis . Another mutation can however restore this balance via a mutation to increase sensitivity of BCMO1 to negative feedback via retinoid acid . Such a cycle can continue until the degree of negative feedback on BCMO1 and SR - B1 is balanced such that uptake of carotenoids can continue without direct dependence upon vitamin A levels . BCMO1 has the potential to effectively regulate retinol levels via cleavage of pro - vitamin A carot - enoids without the need for affecting carotenoid uptake . Such mutations are not merely hypothetical given that polymorphisms in the BCMO1 gene in humans strongly inﬂuence levels of b - carotene and conversion to retinol ( Leung et al . 2009 ) . Another consideration that sheds doubt on the vitamin A - redox hypothesis is that additional regulatory pathways are likely to exist , given that the proportion of nonvita - min - A precursor carotenoids and pro - vitamin A carote - noids will not be constant in the diet and only the latter affects the retinol pool . This provides another reason why regulation at the uptake level , limiting carotenoid acquisi - tion , is unlikely to be constrained by vitamin A homeo - stasis . Moreover , short - term dynamics depleting vitamin A stores – a detrimental event reasoning from the crucial role of vitamin A in physiological processes – will actually lead to a strong upregulation of both vitamin A and carotenoid uptake , thereby potentially increasing caroten - oid - dependent coloration after a detrimental life - event , in striking contrast with the hypothesized role of caroten - oid - dependent signals as an indicator signal of phenotypic quality . Different mechanisms are also plausible . For example , beta - carotene dioxygenase 2 ( BCDO2 ) removes Figure 2 . Correlations ( closed dots ) between retinol and total carotenoids in plasma with the corresponding 95 % conﬁdence intervals . The overall effect as estimated by random - effect meta - analysis , and the corresponding 95 % conﬁdence interval is depicted with an open dot . 226 ª 2014 The Authors .

Simons et al . harmful oxidized carotenoids from mitochondria ( John - son and Hill 2013 ) and regulates carotenoid - based integu - ment coloration of the domestic chicken ( Eriksson et al . 2008 ) . This may suggest different windows in which car - otenoids are beneﬁcial and harmful thereby possibly gen - erating signal honesty ( Johnson and Hill 2013 ) and explaining context - dependent effects of carotenoid sup - plementation on reproduction ( Simons et al . 2014a ) . These considerations , together with the meta - analysis on the relationship between carotenoids and vitamin A , suggest that the joint pathways of uptake of vitamin A and carotenoids , as postulated in the vitamin A - redox hypothesis , are unlikely to be strong enough to maintain signal honesty . Resource allocation and acquisition of car - otenoids or alternative hypotheses ( Hartley and Kennedy 2004 ; Svensson and Wong 2011 ; Simons et al . 2012b , 2014b ) are therefore more likely to maintain honesty in our view . This also encompasses pro - vitamin A carote - noids allocation away from ornamentation toward serving as retinoic acid resource ( Hartley and Kennedy 2004 ) . Alternatively , between - individual variation in vitamin A levels and the associated carotenoid levels , resulting in differential expression of sexual coloration , could reﬂect differences between individuals in the extent to which they tolerate possible costs of reduced vitamin A homeo - stasis . Thus , individuals that acquire higher amounts of carotenoids , and hence are more ornamented , may be tol - erating higher costs and may thus hence be of higher quality . This would mean that such individuals reduce negative feedback of vitamin A on shared vitamin A and carotenoid uptake to increase carotenoid levels , which may impose a cost in terms of reduced vitamin A homeo - stasis or higher vitamin A levels in general . In particular , variability in vitamin A levels could impose a cost , given that it may be possible to reduce the sensitivity of vitamin A - dependent processes negating possible costs of higher vitamin A levels , but variability in vitamin A is likely to result in possibly detrimental variability in these vitamin A - dependent physiological processes . This latter hypothe - sis can be tested by examining within - individual variabil - ity in vitamin A levels ( homeostasis ) and relating this to carotenoid uptake or levels , and sexual coloration . In general , it will be experimental studies that can demonstrate a causal link between vitamin A , carotenoids , and carotenoid - dependent sexual signaling . Moreover , the hypothesized constraints might not be detectable in healthy unchallenged individuals and more insight could be gained by evaluating vitamin A homeostasis and con - nections to signaling in a stressful environment . Note any effect dependent on such an environment will have rela - tively low signaling value because it will not differentiate amongst healthy individuals , whereas choice for caroten - oid - dependent signals can be strong in unchallenging environments ( Simons and Verhulst 2011 ) . In conclusion , our meta - analysis and subsequent considerations do not support a dominant role for vitamin A regulation in maintaining honesty of carotenoid - dependent signals , but we acknowledge that experimental tests are required for a more conclusive statement on the explanatory power of the vitamin A - redox hypothesis .
