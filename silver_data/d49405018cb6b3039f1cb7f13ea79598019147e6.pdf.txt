We discuss the involvement of invadopodia in invasive cell migration , and their capacity to promote cancer metastasis . Considering the regulation of invadopodia formation , we describe studies that demonstrate the role of Rac1 in the metastatic process , and the suggestion that this effect is attributable to the capacity of Rac1 to promote invadopodia formation . This notion is demonstrated here by showing that knockdown of Rac1 in melanoma cells expressing a wild - type form of this GTPase , reduces invadopodia - dependent matrix degradation . Interestingly , we also show that excessive activity of Rac1 , displayed by the P29S , hyperactive , “ fast cycling ” mutant of Rac1 , which is present in 5 – 10 % of melanoma tumors , inhibits invadopodia function . Moreover , knockdown of this hyperactive mutant enhanced matrix degradation , indicating that excessive Rac1 activity by this mutant can negatively regulate invadopodia formation and function . & 2016 Elsevier Inc .

Invadopodia - mediated cancer invasion Invadopodia are actin - based protrusions of the plasma mem - brane that penetrate into the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , and en - zymatically degrade it [ 1 – 3 ] . They belong to a family of structures , collectively known as invadosomes [ 4 ] , that facilitate cell invasion through tissues . This process occurs under speci ﬁ c physiological conditions such as wound repair , embryogenesis , and cell differ - entiation , as well as under pathological conditions such as pa - thogen infection or cancer metastasis [ 5 ] . Invadopodia are unique adhesion structures whose activities – invasion , adhesion and matrix degradation – are each regulated and implemented by a set of multiple proteins . Coordination of their functions occurs on both spatial and temporal levels , con - trolled by a mechanism that can be referred to as a highly co - ordinated “ grip - soften - push ” mechanism [ 6 ] . Invadopodia attach to the ECM via their adhesion domain , a ring - shaped structure surrounding the actin core [ 7 – 9 ] . This ring contains transmembrane integrin receptors and various adhesion proteins such as vinculin , paxillin , zyxin , ILK and Hic - 5 , as well as GTPases and proteases [ 9 ] . The adhesion process is critical for in - vadopodia function , yet it is commonly a transient state [ 7 , 9 ] , which is followed by matrix degradation by a variety of proteases belonging to the metalloproteinase ( MMPs ) , ADAM , and serine protease families [ 2 , 5 , 10 , 11 ] . The membrane - bound protease , MT1 - MMP ( or MMP14 ) , functions as a master regulator of in - vadopodia development [ 10 , 12 ] , whose recruitment promotes Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / yexcr Experimental Cell Research http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . yexcr . 2016 . 02 . 003 0014 - 4827 / & 2016 Elsevier Inc .

Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 82 – 88 invadopodia maturation [ 3 ] and activation of the soluble MMPs , MMP9 and MMP2 [ 11 , 13 ] . The actin core arises out of the adhesion process , starting when receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF receptor are activated [ 14 , 15 ] . This signaling event , in turn , triggers the activation of c - src [ 16 – 19 , 3 – 6 ] , PKC kinases [ 20 – 23 ] and , eventually , the adaptor protein TKS5 [ 24 ] , which plays a key role in the nucleation and formation of the actin core bundle . TKS5 can then bind to Ptdlns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane , enhancing the recruitment of actin regulators , such as NCK1 , to the membrane [ 3 ] . This sig - naling cascade , which leads to actin polymerization in invadopodia cores , is regulated by small Rho - family GTPases , and drives actin polymerization by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 25 – 28 ] . Arp 2 / 3 - driven actin nucleation is promoted by the severing activity of co ﬁ llin [ 29 – 31 ] . The actin bundle thus formed is further stabilized and is mostly CDC42 - dependent [ 2 , 14 ] , which can directly activate the N - WASP - WIP complex ; this , in turn , is mechanically reinforced by cortactin [ 5 ] and fascin [ 25 , 32 , 33 ] , producing a stable “ invasive protrusion ” that pushes against the ventral cell membrane , pro - moting its penetration into the ECM [ 5 , 12 , 14 , 20 , 34 – 36 ] . The main cause of cancer mortality is the process of metastasis . In order to metastasize , cancer cells must acquire the ability to breach the surrounding extracellular matrix ( by various modes of cell invasion [ 37 ] ) , then disperse and penetrate into the sur - rounding normal tissue , as well as into neighboring blood vessels and lymphatics ( by intra - and extravasation ) [ 38 ] . The invasive potential of cancer cells is mostly correlated with their ability to form invadopodia [ 39 ] . This correlation has been demonstrated in many types of cancer cells , among them primary glioma [ 40 ] , breast cancer [ 41 ] , and bladder cancer [ 42 ] . Modulation of invadopodia components was shown to inhibit cancer cell invasion in in vitro models , and cancer metastasis in mice . For example , while overexpression of cortactin in breast cancer cells led to an increase in bone metastatic potential , over - expression of a phosphorylation - de ﬁ cient mutant cortactin re - duced the cell ’ s metastatic potential [ 43 ] . Furthermore , expression of various TKS5 adaptor isoforms was shown to regulate the me - tastatic potential of lung adenocarcinoma in a mouse model : While the short TKS5 isoform inhibits metastasis , the long one promotes it [ 44 ] . 2 . Rho family GTPases and their role in invadopodia - mediated cancer invasion Studies addressing the regulation of invadopodia formation and function focused much attention around the involvement of Rho - family GTPases in the number and activity of invadopodia in cancer cells . Activation of Rho GTPases was shown to drive in - vadopodia development and invasion in epithelial ovarian cancer cells [ 45 ] . Over - activation of small GTPases through upregulation of intracellular GTP levels was also shown to enhance the ability of melanoma cells to invade and metastasize [ 46 ] . Though Rho family GTPases were shown to be involved in in - vadopodia formation and function [ 2 ] , until now , most such stu - dies have focused primarily on the small Rho - family GTPase CDC42 [ 2 , 28 ] . Expression of constitutively active CDC42 in RPMI17951 melanoma cells increased formation of invadopodia , while expression of dominant negative RAC1 resulted in a diffuse type of matrix degradation [ 47 ] . In glioma cells , inhibition of RAC1 Fig . 1 . RAC1 - P29S is an active form of RAC1 in cells that harbor the mutation . ( A ) A schematic drawing depicting the mode of Rac1 - mediated signaling , including the activation of the molecule by exchange factors ( GEFs ) , replacing bound GDP with GTP , and its deactivation by Rac - GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) . The active form of Rac1 , in turn , is responsible for multiple cellular processes , including regulation of cell growth and survival ( e . g . , via stimulation of MAP kinases and NFkB ) and modulation of cytoskeletal organization ( e . g . , via activation of the WAVE1 - Arp2 / 3 pathway ) , which enhances cell migration , invasion and metastasis . At the bottom , a scheme of the Rac1 molecule is presented , highlighting the main domains of the molecule , and pointing to the position of the P29S mutation within the Switch I domain . ( B ) Sanger sequencing chromatogram showing the zygosity of the 104Tand 83Tcells . A normal Rac1 chromatogram is shown for comparison . Red arrow indicates the C 4 T mutation leading to the P29 4 S amino acid change in the Rac1 protein ( C ) RAC1 activation assay . 104Tand 83Tcells were cultured for 24 hours prior to lysis . Lysates were precipitated using PDB - PAK beads ; a small amount was set aside for use as a loading control . Each sample was split into two , and 0 . 1 mM GTP γ S was added to one of the samples . O . - Y . Revach et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 82 – 88 83 reduced invadopodia formation [ 48 ] , and in MCF10A cells , such inhibition reduced matrix degradation . Based on such results , it was proposed that RAC1 has a role in invadopodia formation and invasive function , although the mechanisms underlying this pro - cess are still poorly understood . Another instance of actin reorganization occurs during cell migration [ 37 ] . This process is mainly regulated by the small GTPases RAC1 and Cdc42 [ 37 ] , which play an important role in driving the development of lamellipodial and ﬁ lopodial extensions at the cell ’ s leading edge during cell migration , and are known to promote cancer invasion [ 49 , 50 ] . During the past decade , multiple melanoma oncogenes were identi ﬁ ed , several of which were successfully targeted pharma - cologically , using small molecular - weight drugs [ 51 , 52 ] . Among them , the small GTPase RAC1 , mutated at position 29 , was shown to be associated with 5 – 10 % of all melanomas . This mutant was shown to be an active form ( “ fast - cycling ” ) of RAC1 [ 53 , 54 ] , sug - gesting that excessive Rac1 activity might promote melanoma malignancy . The P29S mutation is located in the switch I region of RAC1 , known to be a conserved regulatory element of the GTPase superfamily , important for nucleotide binding and , therefore , in - teractions with downstream effectors [ 54 – 56 ] . RAC1 - P29S was shown to bind more GTP , as well as downstream effectors such as PAK1 and MLK3 [ 53 , 54 ] . It also induces ERK phosphorylation , cell proliferation , membrane ruf ﬂ ing , and transwell migration in normal cells [ 54 , 57 ] . The general mode of action of Rac1 , and its P29S mutant , are shown in Fig . 1A . Due to the importance of RAC1 in cytoskeletal regulation dur - ing migration , primarily through its ability to stimulate actin nu - cleation at the leading edge [ 53 , 58 ] and its newly discovered as - sociation with metastatic melanoma , we aimed to characterize the effects of RAC1 - P29S on cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organiza - tion in melanoma . We speci ﬁ cally focused on the involvement of the RAC1 - P29S mutation in the regulation of invadopodia forma - tion and organization in metastatic melanoma cells . 3 . RAC1 - P29S is an active form of RAC1 in cells that harbor the mutation To study the effects of RAC1 - P29S on adhesion , cytoskeletal organization , and invadopodia formation and function in mela - noma cells , we used four melanoma cell lines , two of which ex - press wild - type RAC1 ( A375 and 31T ) and two that harbor the RAC1 - P29S mutation ( 104T and 83T ) . From the available Sanger sequencing information , shown in Fig . 1B , we know that one of the mutant cell lines is a homozygote for the mutation ( 83T ) , and the other ( 104T ) is a heterozygote ( Fig . 1B ) . To test if the zygosity af - fects RAC1 activity in the cells , both mutants were analyzed using the RAC1 activation assay ( Fig . 1C ) . As shown , the homozygous Fig . 2 . RAC1 - P29S drives lamellipodia formation in cells that harbor the mutation . ( A ) Snapshots of time - lapse , phase contrast microscopy of 104T , 83T ( RAC1 - P29S ) , and 31T , A375 ( RAC1 - WT ) cells . The cells were plated on ﬁ bronectin - coated , glass - bottom dishes and cultured for 6 h , to enable cell spreading . Scale bar : 100 um ( Supplementary Movie 1 ) . ( B ) Western blot analysis of RAC1 levels in control ( siCON ) , or RAC1 knockdown ( siRAC1 ) in 83T , 104T , 31Tand A375 cells . ( C ) First and last time point of time - lapse , phase contrast microscopy of control ( siCON ) versus RAC1 knockdown ( siRAC1 ) of 104Tand A375 cells . The cells were plated on ﬁ bronectin - coated , glass - bottom dishes and cultured for 6 h , to enable cell spreading . Cells were then imaged every 5 min for 24 h ( Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Magni ﬁ cation as in A . O . - Y . Revach et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 82 – 88 84 mutant 83T demonstrated considerably stronger Rac1 activity than the heterozygous mutant , when normalized to the total Rac1 protein present in the cell . This was true both at basal levels of Rac1 activity , and after stabilization of the active Rac1 form by the addition of GTP ɣ S , a non - hydrolysable form of GTP ( Fig . 1C ) . No - tably , Rac1 activity levels were very low in the wild - type Rac1 melanoma lines , A375 and 31T ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that the zygosity of RAC1 - P29S correlates with RAC1 ac - tivation in the cells , strengthening the claim that the mutant en - codes for an active RAC1 , as previously shown [ 57 ] . 4 . RAC1 - P29S drives lamellipodia formation in cells that harbor the mutation To test the activation of RAC1 - P29S at the level of cytoskeletal function , the two RAC1 - WT cell lines ( A375 and 31T ) and the two mutant cell lines ( 104T and 83T ) were monitored for over 24 h by phase contrast , live - cell microscopy ( Fig . 2A and Supplementary Movie 1 ) . Both mutant cells formed multiple , rounded lamellipo - dia per cell , and kept their migratory phenotype throughout the assessment . The migratory behavior of the mutant cells was distinctly different from that of the WT cells , which were more polarized and displayed fewer lamellipodia ( Fig . 2A and Supple - mentary Movie 1 ) . Supplementary material related to this article can be found online at http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . yexcr . 2016 . 02 . 003 . To verify that lamellipodia formation in the mutant cells is due to RAC1 activity , RAC1 was knocked down in both the 104T mutant cells and the A375 WT cells ( Fig . 2B ; 104T and A375 ) , and the cells were followed for 24 h using time - lapse microscopy ( Fig . 2C , and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . Both WT and mutant RAC1 mutant cells displayed reduced motility upon RAC1 knockdown ( siRAC1 ) , compared to control siRNA ( siCON ) . In the mutant 104T cells , treatment with RAC1 siRNA led to a gradual loss of the lamelli - podia phenotype , and over time , the cells became polarized and less motile ( Fig . 2C , and Supplementary Movie 2 ) . In comparison , control cells ( siCON ) kept their migratory phenotype throughout the period of monitoring .

RAC1 - P29S negatively regulates invadopodia function in melanoma cells As RAC1 is known to be involved in actin remodeling processes , we tested the capacity of the RAC1 - P29S mutation to affect in - vadopodia formation and function . To this end , we knocked down RAC1 by siRNA in the two WT ( A375 , 31T ) and two mutant RAC1 cell lines ( 104T , 83T ) ( Fig . 2B ) , and analyzed invadopodia forma - tion and function using a gelatin degradation assay . To our surprise , Rac1 knockdown led to a differential effect on invadopodia - mediated matrix degradation in the WT and mutant cells . Knockdown of Rac1 in WT cells caused a twofold reduction in matrix degradation in both cell types ( A375 and 31T ) ( Fig . 3A and B ) , while knockdown of Rac1 in the mutant cell lines ( 104T and 83T ) , caused a dramatic elevation in invadopodia function ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Notably , the effect of increased invadopodia function in 83T cells that harbor a homozygous P29S mutation was Fig . 3 . RAC1 enhances invadopodia function in melanoma cells WT for Rac1 . ( A ) Representative gelatin degradation assay of control ( siCON ) and RAC1 knockdown ( siRAC1 ) in A375 and 31T ( WT ) cells . Cells were cultured on ﬂ uorescently labeled gelatin for 6 h . Cells were then ﬁ xed and stained for actin ( as invadopodia marker ) , and DAPI and gelatin degradation were analyzed . Scale bar : 20um .

( A ) Representative experiment of gelatin degradation assay of control ( siCON ) and RAC1 knock down ( siRAC1 ) in 104T and 83T cells ( RAC1 - P29S ) . Scale bar 20 um . ( B ) Invadopodia function analysis , of control versus RAC1 knock down 104T and 83T cells . Invadopodia function was quanti ﬁ ed as gelatin degradation area / cell ( m m2 ) using ImageJ software , and was normalized to the control ( percentages ) . Fig . 5 . Effect of Rac1 knockdown on the percentage of invadopodia - forming cells , in cells harboring the Rac1 - P29S mutation ( 104T and 83T ) or in cells wild - type for Rac1 ( A375 and 31T ) . The number of invadopodia - forming cells was counted manually in the experiments described in Figs . 3 and 4 . As shown , Rac1 knockdown had no effect on the percentage of invadopodia - forming cells in the 31T and A375 lines ( both expressing WT Rac1 ) , as well as in the mutant 104T line , suggesting that the effects of the knockdown on the total matrix degradation activity are mostly attributable to the effect on the degradation by individual cells . In the case of the mutant 83Tcells , part of the enhancement is attributable to the increase in the number of invadopodia - forming cells ( (cid:1) 2 fold ) . O . - Y . Revach et al . / Experimental Cell Research 343 ( 2016 ) 82 – 88 86 consistently stronger than that seen in the 104T cells that harbor a heterozygous P29S mutation ( Fig . 4A and B ) , suggesting that WT - RAC1 and P29S - RAC1 regulate invadopodia function in opposite ways . In addition , it would appear that the overall effect of RAC1 on invadopodia occurs downstream of core formation , since the number of invadopodia - forming cells was similar in control ( siCON ) and knockdown ( siRAC1 ) in both WT and the hetero - zygous RAC1 - P29S mutant cells . Interestingly , in the homozygous mutant cell line 83T , RAC1 - P29S showed a clear capacity to ne - gatively regulate not only invadopodia matrix degradation ability , but also the prominence of invadopodia - forming cells ( Fig . 5 ) . In conclusion , we show here that Rac1 can serve as a potent regulator of invasive cell migration and invadopodia - dependent matrix degradation . Interestingly the effects of the WT Rac1 are quite different from those of the mutant Rac1 . As shown here , Rac1 activity in A375 and 31T cells is rather low , compared to that of the mutated 104T and 83T cells , and this difference is manifested in the higher capacity of the mutant to develop lamellipodia and migrate . Surprisingly , and potentially most interesting , is our ob - servation that the hyper - active mutated form , Rac1 - P29S , unlike WT Rac1 , suppresses matrix degradation while enhancing la - mellipodial extension , raising the possibility that the WT and mutant forms of Rac1 operate along different downstream cytos - keletal elements , and possibly signaling pathways . The sig - ni ﬁ cance of these differences for understanding the tumorigenic properties of the hyperactive mutant remains to be unraveled .
