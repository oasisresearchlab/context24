A hallmark of the SC is the presence of its constituent protein SYCP3 on the chromosome axis . During SC assembly , SYCP3 is deposited on both axes of the homologue pair , form - ing axial elements that fuse into the lateral element ( LE ) in the tripartite structure of the mature SC . We have used cryo - electron tomography and atomic force microscopy to study the mechanism of assembly and DNA binding of the SYCP3 fibre . We find that the three - dimensional architecture of the fibre is built on a highly irregular arrangement of SYCP3 molecules displaying very limited local geometry . Interaction between SYCP3 mol - ecules is driven by the intrinsically disordered tails of the protein , with no contact between the helical cores , resulting in a flexible fibre assembly . We demonstrate that the SYCP3 fibre can engage in extensive interactions with DNA , indicative of an efficient mechanism for incorporation of DNA within the fibre . Our findings suggest that SYCP3 deposition on the chromo - some axis might take place by polymerization into a fibre that is fastened to the chromosome surface via DNA binding . 1 . Introduction At the heart of meiosis lies the exchange of genetic material between homologous parental chromosomes , which generates sexual diversity in the offspring . Correct and efficient recombination ( crossover ) between homologous chromosomes requiresthat they become physicallyaligned along their length . A supramolecular proteinaceous structure known asthe synaptonemal complex ( SC ) is acritical par - ticipant in the process of crossover at meiotic prophase , by acting as a molecular zipper and linking the homologous chromosomes during recombination [ 1 , 2 ] . Despite considerable variation in the nature and sequence of its protein com - ponents , the SC structure shows a remarkable evolutionary conservation , consisting of lateral elements ( LEs ) that form on each paired chromosome and are linked by transverse filaments to a central element ( CE ) [ 3 ] . Relatively little is known about the detailed structure of the SC , and how its dynamic architecture influences meiotic processes . Recent studies using super - resolution fluorescence have begun to provide important insights into the overall 3D structure of the SC and location of known factors [ 4 – 6 ] . SYCP3 is a major protein component of the LE [ 7 ] . It is recruited to meiotic chromosomes in leptotene , contributing to the formation of axial elements that spreadover the entire length of the chromosome axis at pachytene , resulting even - tually in the formation of the LE in the tripartite SC structure [ 8 ] . The molecular mechanism of LE assembly is unknown , but it requires the involvement , together with SYCP3 , of other meiotic axial proteins . Indeed , an evolutionarily conserved set of chromosome axis proteins comprising members of the Hormad family and coiled - coil proteins ( for example , Hop1 and Red1 in yeast , ASY1 and ASY3 , ASY4 in plants , Hormad 1 , 2 and SYCP2 , SYCP3 in humans ) is likely to be responsible © 2019 The Authors .

The three - dimensional architecture of the meiotic chromosome that is competent for recombination results from the functional and physical interactions of SC components with meiotic cohesin complexes [ 12 – 17 ] . Correct SYCP3 function is essential for SC formation , chromosome synapsis and fertility [ 8 , 18 ] . Sycp3 gene knockout causes infertility in male mice and reduced fertility in females , due to aneuploidy in oocytes and ensuing embryonic lethality [ 8 , 19 ] , and a mutation that renders SYCP3 defective causes human male infertility [ 20 ] . Overexpression of SYCP3 has been reported in some types of cancer [ 21 , 22 ] . In SYCP3 - null male mice , the LE and SC do not form and homologous chromosomes fail to achieve full synapsis [ 8 , 17 , 23 ] . A twofold increase in chromosome fibre length in SYCP3 - deficient mice oocytes suggests a defect in chromosome organization [ 19 ] . Presumably , the LE must assemble on the existing structure of the chromosome axis , which is determined to a large extent by meiotic cohesins [ 14 , 15 , 24 , 25 ] . SYCP3 folds into a highly elongated helical tetramer , where each chain forms antiparallel coiled - coil interactions and with two N - and C - tails protruding at each end of the helical core [ 26 ] . A well - characterized property of SYCP3 is its ability to form filamentous fibres displaying transversal striations when overexpressed in mammalian cells [ 20 , 27 – 29 ] ; this behaviour is mirrored by the ability of the recombinant protein to polymerize into similar , striated filamentous struc - tures [ 26 ] . Although the structural determinants driving SYCP3 polymerization are presently unknown , self - assembly is critically dependent on sequence motifs in the N - and C - termini of the SYCP3 tetrameric structure [ 26 , 28 ] . In addition to forming large filamentous structures , SYCP3 can interact with double - stranded DNA , via DNA - binding motifs located in its N - terminal tails [ 26 ] . The presence of DNA - binding domains at either end of the elongated rod - like shapeoftheSYCP3tetramerindicatesthatitcansimultaneously interact with distinct segments of DNA [ 30 ] . Single - molecule studies of the interaction of SYCP3 with DNA showed that DNA - bound SYCP3 molecules can form clusters that drive a limited degree of DNA compaction , in agreement with SYCP3 ’ s structural role in determining LE architecture [ 30 ] . In this paper , we set out to elucidate how SYCP3 self - associates into filamentous fibres and how the SYCP3 fibres interact with DNA . Using a combination of cryo - electron tom - ography of the SYCP3 fibres and atomic force microscopy of SYCP3 - DNA complexes , we have obtained important new insights into SYCP3 function . We show that the regular higher - order structure of the SYCP3 fibre arises from a remark - ably heterogeneous mode of association of individual SYCP3 particles , conferring plasticity to the fibre . Furthermore , we pro - vide experimental evidence that polymeric SYCP3 fibres can engage in extensive interactions with DNA . Our results suggest that SYCP3 can coat the chromosome axis in a continuous structure containing both DNA - bound and DNA - free SYCP3 layers . We discuss the implications of this structural model for the function of SYCP3 and LE assembly in meiosis . 2 . Material and methods 2 . 1 . Protein expression Amino acid sequences corresponding to 1 – 236 ( full length ) and 1 – 230 of human SYCP3 were cloned into the pHAT4 vector [ 31 ] for expression in bacteria with an N - terminal TEV - protease cleavable His6 - tag . Recombinant proteins were expressed in Rosetta 2 ( DE3 ) E . coli ( Novagen ) . Trans - formed cells were plated out on LB agar supplemented with 34 µg ml − 1 chloramphenicol and 100 µg ml − 1 ampicillin . Bacterial colonies were transferred to 1 l 2xYT ( 100 µg ml − 1 ampicillin , 34 µg ml − 1 chloramphenicol ) at 37°C and grown until 0 . 6 OD600 in a baffled 2 l flask . Bacteria were then induced ( 0 . 5 mM IPTG , 25°C ) and grown overnight , har - vested by centrifugation ( 4000 g , 20°C , 20 min ) , resuspended in 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 400 mM KCl buffer ( 25 ml buffer per pellet of 1 l culture ) containing EDTA - free protease inhibitors ( Sigma ) and stored at − 80°C . 2 . 2 . Protein purification The bacteriawere lysed bysonication , the lysatewas clarified by centrifugation ( 30 000 g , 4°C , 30 min ) and passed through a 45 µm filter . SYCP3 proteins were first purified using Ni - NTA agarose resin ( Qiagen ) . A Ni - NTA column ( 2 ml ) was equili - brated with five column volumes of wash buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 400 mM KCl ) . The clarified lysate was passed over the column under gravity flow . The column was washed with 20columnvolumes ofwash buffer to remove unboundbacterial proteins , followed by 4 column volumes of wash buffer with 20 mM imidazole to remove weakly binding bacterial contaminant proteins . Bound SYCP3 was recovered in two elution steps , using wash buffer with 100 and 200 mM imida - zole . The 200 mM imidazole elution typically contained the cleanest recombinant protein , and was purified further as described below . 2 . 2 . 1 . Full - length SYCP3 To cleave the His 6 - tag , TEV protease was added at mass ratio of 1 : 50 and incubated at 4°C overnight . To help remove nucleic acid contamination present after the Ni - NTA step , benzonase was also added during the TEV treatment . Full - length SYCP3 was then concentrated by centrifugation device and further purified by gel filtration over a Superdex 200 16 / 60 column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 400 mM KCl . Peak fractions were analysed by SDS - PAGE , pooled , spin concentrated ( 4500 g , 10°C ) using 4 ml Amicon Ultra 10 000 MWCO filter units ( Millipore ) , flash frozen and stored at − 80°C . 2 . 2 . 2 . SYCP3 1 – 230 To cleave the His 6 - tag , TEV protease was added at mass ratio of 1 : 50 and incubated overnight on ice . SYCP3 1 – 230 was further purified by cation - exchange over a 5 - ml HiTrap SP column ( GE Healthcare ) and Heparin Sepharose chromato - graphy ( GE Healthcare ) , using a linear salt gradient from 150 mM to 1 M KCl gradient in 20 mM Tris - HCl pH8 . 0 , 150 mM KCl . Peak fractions were pooled , spin concentrated ( 4500 g , 10°C ) using 4 ml Amicon Ultra 10 000 MWCO filter units ( Millipore ) , flash frozen and stored at − 80°C . 2 . 3 . Salt - dependent aggregation of SYCP3 The aggregation index ( AI ) of the SYCP3 protein was analysed adaptingapublishedprotocol [ 32 ] , usingthefollowingformula : AI ¼ 100 (cid:2) A340 A280 (cid:3) A340 , r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 9 : 190094 2 where A340 and A280 are the absorbance of the SYCP3 sample at 340 nm and 280 nm , respectively . The AI provides an indi - cation of the aggregation state of a protein sample in solution , independent of its concentration . The AI was used to study the salt dependency of SYCP3 aggregation , measuring five SYCP3 samples at 25 µM in 20 mM Tris - HCl buffer pH 8 . 0 and KCl concentrations ranging from 100 to 500 mM . 2 . 4 . Sample vitrification for cryo - electron tomography 100 µl of BSA - coated 10 nm gold bead suspension ( Aurion , Wageningen , The Netherlands ) were centrifuged at 14 000 g for 10 min , the clear supernatant discarded , and the gold beads resuspended in 50 µl ice - cold 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 ( DB buffer ) . Quantifoil grids ( Cu 200 mesh , 2 / 1 holey carbon , Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH , Jena , Germany ) were plasma - cleaned for 30 s . Vitrification was carried out in a Vitrobot Mk IV ( FEI / Thermo Fisher , Eindhoven , The Netherlands ) , with the sample chamber set to 4°C and 90 % humidity , a blot - ting strength parameter set to ‘ 10 ’ and a blotting time of 5 s . 3 µl of previously prepared gold particle resuspension were applied to the grid . The droplet was allowed to dry for about 2 min , until only a thin liquid film covered the grid . Immedi - ately afterwards , 4 µl of ice - cooled SYCP3 protein solution ( 14 mg ml − 1 ) , freshly mixed 1 : 1 with DB buffer , to reduce salt concentration and promote fibre formation , were pipetted onto the grid . After a short incubation time of 10 s , the grid was transferred to the Vitrobot , blotted and plunged into a liquid nitrogen - cooled bath of 37 % ethane , 63 % propane . 2 . 5 . Cryo - electron tomography of SYCP3 fibres Ten tilt series of fibres were recorded with a Tecnai G2 Polara ( Thermo Fisher ) , equipped with a 300 kV FEG , a Gatan post - column energy filter and a K2 Summit direct electron detector ( Gatan ) . Images were recorded at a working magnification factor of 34 000× , a pixel size of 3 . 45 Å px − 1 and a dose rate of 0 . 8 e Å − 2 s − 1 with a total dose per tilt series of 70 – 100 e Å − 2 . The target defocus was 2 . 5 µm . For each tilt series , 61 micrographs were recorded at 2° increments with a tilt order of − 30° to + 60° followed by − 32° to − 60° . 2 . 6 . Tomographic reconstruction and subtomogram analysis Here we provide a complete description of the subtomogram analysis of the SYCP3 fibres under native conditions . Further information on the method can be found in our recently pub - lished protocol for analysis of filamentous protein assemblies such as the SYCP3 fibres [ 33 ] . Drift correction for the tilt series micrographs was performed with MotionCor2 [ 34 ] . The tomograms were backprojected in IMOD [ 35 ] , using the embedded 10 nm gold markers as fiducials for the align - ment . Due to the characteristically low signal - to - noise of the tomographic reconstructions , it was not practical to identify and select individual SYCP3 tetramers as subvolumes . Instead , subvolume coordinates were picked along the stria - tion density of the fibres . To facilitate the detection of the striations within the fibre , the tomographic volumes were low - pass filtered with a cut - off at 0 . 44 nm − 1 . Two coordinate models were created using IMOD [ 35 ] , by manually tracing the ends of individual striations with a single contour and then interpolating equidistant points within each contour via the program addModPts of the PEET package [ 36 , 37 ] . The first model featured a smaller set of 5756 coordinates , widely spaced at 44 nm ( 128 voxels ) , which was used to gen - erate an initial reference structure de novo ( see below ) . The second model comprised a total of 46051 subvolume coordi - nates , at a narrow spacing of 16 . 5 nm ( 48 voxels ) in the XY plane and 22 nm ( 64 voxels ) along Z . This set of coordinates was used later for masked structural refinement . Subtomogram averaging was performed in R ELION v . 2 . 1 , adapting a modified protocol by Bharat & Scheres [ 38 ] . The IMOD coordinate models were converted to ASCII format using model2point [ 35 ] . CTF estimation and correction was performed with ctffind4 ( 4 . 0 . 15 ) [ 39 ] , via the relion _ prepare _ subtomograms . py script [ 38 ] . The first set of subvolume coordi - nates was used to extract 5767 non - overlapping subvolumes , rescaled from 128 3 voxels unbinned to a size of 64 3 voxels ( equiv - alentto44 × 44 × 44 nm 3 atapixelsizeof6 . 9 Åpx − 1 ) . Anidentical set was extracted and resized with a binning factor of 2 . Due to the manual picking of coordinates , each subvolume was only roughly centred on a striation density . Since the long axis of the fibres was oriented parallel to the grid surface , a translatio - nal alignment in the XY plane was sufficient to precisely align all subvolumes within the fibre pattern . For this , Z - projections of all rescaled subvolumes were used as the input for a reference - free 2D classification of three classes . This step served as an XY - plane alignment measure , as well as a screen - ing step to remove unsuitable particles , such as subvolumes picked too close to the edge of a fibre , from the following pro - cessing steps . The majority of particles ( 51 % ) contributed to a class that showed a clear striation density layer at its centre , with separate elongated densities of around 2 × 20 nm in size connecting orthogonally to adjacent striations , in good agree - ment with the dimensions of the coiled - coil core region of an SYCP3 tetramer [ 26 ] . Using the relion _ 2Dto3D _ star . py script [ 38 ] , the file paths of 2D projections contributing to this class averagewere translated back to their respective 3D subvolumes in a new particles _ subtomo _ 2Dto3D . star table . In addition to the file paths , the translational shift columns ( _ rlnOriginX and _ rlnOriginY ) were added for each subvolume . Using this list of XY - centred subvolumes , a reference - free 3D angular search was performed . The resulting single - class average con - stituted a low resolution de novo structure and was rotated with IMOD ’ s rotatevol function ( http : / / bio3d . colorado . edu / imod / doc / man / rotatevol . html ) so that the striation plane was orthogonal to the Y - axis of the subvolume . The rotated structure was subsequently refined in 3D classification and 3D auto - refinement steps against the entire first set of subvo - lumes . The refined structural average featured a clearly aligned centred striation density , with orthogonally connecting elongated SYCP3 tetramers , roughly arranged in a rectangular mesh along the striation plane . Using the second set of coordinates , 46051 overlapping subvolumes of 44 × 44 × 44 nm 3 ( 128 3 voxels at the unbinned pixel size of 3 . 45 Å px − 1 ) were extracted and rescaled by a factor of 0 . 5 , corresponding to a subvolume size of 64 3 voxels at twice the pixel size ( 6 . 9 Å px − 1 ) . This larger set of subvo - lumes was used for a masked 3D classification , with the refined de novo structure created in the previous step serving as the input reference . The reference mask was created in Matlab / Tom Toolbox [ 40 ] , and consisted of a narrow cylinder of 24 voxel diameter ( equivalent to 16 . 5 nm at a binning factor of 2 ) with its long axis oriented parallel to the Y - axis and a r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 9 : 190094 3 smooth Gaussian falloff within a rescaled 64 3 voxel volume . The masked 3D classification resulted in 4 class averages , with nearly equal class distributions . Subvolumes with a large translational shift ( with individual translational shifts in X , Y and Z ≥ d = ð 2 p 2 Þ , d being the distance of subvolume coor - dinates in voxels ) were removed to exclude auto - correlation effects of potentially overlapping subvolumes . Each trimmed class dataset was then 3D auto - refined . These final refined class averages showed a high degree of heterogeneity in the organization of the SYCP3 tetramer within the fibre , with resolutions of around 30 – 27 Å . Additional hier - archical 3D classification of these classes , focusing on a single striation - striation repeat by using a reference mask of only a half cylinder and splitting each refined subvolume subset into 8 classes , resulted in a clearer separation of structural motifs but did not improve resolution . Consistent with this , the class distribution was close to 12 . 5 % ( ±2 % ) for the refined subsets 1 , 2 and 3 , confirming the presence of high structural heterogeneity ; subset 4 showed a slight deviation from this pat - tern as it featured two heavily warped class averages with 16 . 6 % and 15 . 9 % subvolume distribution , probably due to the missing wedge - induced elongation of subvolumes , which could not be compensated for with sufficient precision . 2 . 7 . Atomic force microscopy Foranalysis of the DNA - free fibres , purified SYCP3 was diluted to micromolar concentrations ( 1 – 3 µM ) into a low - salt buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl ) to induce fibre for - mation , deposited on freshly cleaved mica and incubated at room temperature for 10 min . The samples were washed five times with 1 ml of BPC grade water ( Sigma ) and dried under a nitrogen stream . For fibre formation in the presence of DNA , 0 . 5 nM plasmid DNA was mixed with a 5 - fold molar excess of SYCP3 in the low - salt buffer and incubated for 5 min at room temperature . Before deposition on mica , 5 mM MgCl 2 were added to the buffer , to facilitate binding of the protein – DNA complexes on the negatively charged mica sur - face . The experiments were also performed on poly - l - lysine coated mica in the absence of MgCl 2 , with identical results . The majority of experiments were performed with pUC19 DNA , but other circular double - stranded DNA such as PhiX174 RFII were tested with similar results . The samples were washed and dried as described above . Imaging was per - formed using a Bruker Dimension FastScan AFM , in air , at ambient temperature . The probes used were FastScan - A ( Bruker ) , with resonant frequency of 1400 kHz and the drive frequencies were approximately 5 % below the maximal reson - ance peak . AFM images were acquired at a rate of four frames per minute and plane - fitted to remove tilt . Each scan line was fitted to a first - order equation , using N ANO S COPE A NALYSIS v . 1 . 9 software ( Bruker ) . To measure the height of the fibres , cross sections were taken across ten different areas of each fibre using N ANO S COPE Analysis . The length of fibres reported , representsthe longest available continuous path along the fibre . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . In vitro reconstitution of the SYCP3 fibres We had previously shown that recombinant human SYCP3 forms filamentous fibres that can be visualized by negative - stain electron microscopy ( EM ) on continuous carbon grids [ 26 ] . The fibres show a periodic pattern of trans - versal , alternating light and dark bands , appearing at regular intervals of 22 nm . To determine whether SYCP3 fibre for - mation and its periodic appearance is an intrinsic property of SYCP3 in solution , we examined recombinant SYCP3 by cryo - electron microscopy . First , we established buffer con - ditions for controlled SYCP3 polymerization , by determining that salt concentrations less than 300 mM KCl drive rapid SYCP3 self - association into a fibre ( electronic supplementary material , figure S1 ) . We then exploited the salt - dependency of SYCP3 ’ s aggregation state to prepare SYCP3 fibres in solution , which were preserved in vitreous ice . Electron micrographs showed that SYCP3 fibres in vitreous ice maintained the same macroscopic organization observed by negative - stain EM , consisting of transversal 22 nm - wide striations ( figure 1 a ; electronic supplementary material , figure S2 ) . Different from the ribbon - like appearance of SYCP3 fibres prepared on continuous carbon grids , the SYCP3 fibre embedded in vitreous ice appeared as approximately cylindri - cal objects , with length in the micrometre scale and a diameter of the oval cross - section of 100 – 250 nm , indicating that the striation pattern extends three - dimensionally throughout the fibre ( figure 1 a ) . To confirm that fibre formation is a robust bio - chemical property of SYCP3 which persists under different preparation modes , we visualized the SYCP3 fibres by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . AFM analysis showed the presence of filamentous SYCP3 fibres that had a clear resemblance to those observed by EM , including the presence of the transverse 22 nm repeat ( figure 1 b ) . As the cryoEM analysis had shown that the SYCP3 fibre maintains its characteristic periodic appearance in solution , we decided to investigate its three - dimensional architecture using cryo - electron tomography . A total of ten tomograms for native SYCP3 fibres were recorded under cryogenic con - ditions ( electronic supplementary material , movie S1 ) and the tomographic volumes reconstructed ( see Material and methods ) . The presence of a periodic striation pattern was confirmed by Fourier analysis , which revealed a correspond - ing layer line of spatial frequency of 0 . 045 nm − 1 ( 22 nm ) . 3 . 2 . Sub - tomogram averaging of the SYCP3 fibre To determine the structural basis for the homotypic SYCP3 interactions that underpin the three - dimensional architecture of the fibre , we performed sub - tomogram averaging . Due to the apparent dense packing of SYCP3 within the fibre and the low signal - to - noise typical of cryo - electron tomography , we did not attempt to pick individual SYCP3 particles for determination of initial subvolume coordinates . Instead , we chose the clearly identifiable 22 nm striation pattern as the guiding feature for subvolume coordinate selection . Thus , for each striation layer of the fibre , start and end points were selected manually , followed by automatic picking of intervening subvolume coordinate points ( electronic sup - plementary material , figure S3 ) . Two sets of coordinate models were created this way . The first model , which was used to generate an initial reference structure de novo , had a large spacing of 44 nm ( 128 voxels ) between each subvolume coordinate along the striation pattern . The second coordinate model featured a narrower spacing of 16 . 5 nm ( 48 voxels ) . This procedure was applied to the ten tomograms , resulting in 5756 subvolume coordinates for set 1 and 46 051 for set 2 . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 9 : 190094 4 A reference - free 2D classification of Z - projected subvo - lumes extracted from set 1 was then performed in R ELION [ 41 ] , to obtain 2D averages of the striation pattern and align all particles in the XY plane ( figure 2 a ) . The 2D - class averages indicated that each striation in the fibre contained a parallel array of elongated densities , which resembled the character - istic rod - like shape of the helical core of individual SYCP3 tetramers [ 26 ] . The 2D averages further showed that the SYCP3 tetramers are aligned side - by - side in a direction paral - lel to the fibre long axis , and interact end - to - end to span the 22 nm repeat of the fibre . To gain further insight into the three - dimensional organiz - ation of the SYCP3 fibre , we performed a maximum - likelihood 3D classification using R ELION [ 41 ] . Exploiting the parallel orien - tation of the fibres to the grid surface , the subvolumes were aligned based on their projections in the XY plane of the fibre . The alignments were then used as the starting point for a rotational 3D alignment . This procedure resulted in a low - resolution de novo structure which served as the initial reference model for masked 3D classification and 3D auto - refinement using the second , larger dataset ( electronic supplementary material , figure S4 ) . The final class averages derived from the 3D classification were highly similar , and revealed a remarkable degree of structural heterogeneity in the arrangement of SYCP3 molecules within the fibre ( figure 2 b and electronic supplemen - tary material , figure S5 ) . Importantly , further hierarchical 3D classification did not yield distinct , better - resolved models of the averaged sub - volumes ( electronic supplementary material , figure S6 ) indicating that a lack of long - range 3D order is an intrinsic architectural feature of the SYCP3 fibre . Sub - tomogram averaging showed that individual rod - shaped SYCP3 tetramers are arranged in a parallel fashion along the long axis of the fibre . Occasionally , a kink or a bend is detected within a particle , in agreement with our previous X Y Z X Y Z Z 200 nm 0 100 nm 250 nm 30 nm ( a ) ( b ) Figure 1 .

Despite lack of side - by - side contacts between adjacent helical cores , the SYCP3 particles remain in vertical register within a layer . Thus , all contacts between SYCP3 particles appear to be mediated by the N - and C - exten - sions , taking place within the dense striations transversal to the fibre ( figure 2 c ) . A striking result of the 3D classification is the lackof geometric regularity in the planararrangement ofneigh - bouring SYCP3 particles , as highlighted by the XZ section of the 3D classes ; the sections show only a loosely rectangular arrangement of SYCP3 particles but no discernible long - range order . The implications of this finding for SYCP3 function are analysed in the Discussion . 3 . 3 .

The com - bination of these two biochemical properties is likely to form the basis for SYCP3 ’ s role in lateral element formation . Single - molecule experiments had provided evidence of DNA - dependent clustering by a C - terminally truncated version of SYCP3 that is defective in fibre formation [ 30 ] . However , direct evidence that the SYCP3 fibre is competent to interact with DNA has been lacking . To investigate its potential mode of DNA binding , we pre - pared samples of SYCP3 for AFM in the presence of plasmid DNA . The AFM images provided striking evidence of DNA incorporation into the SYCP3 fibre ( figure 3 a ; electronic sup - plementary material , figure S7 ) . The regular and continuous presence of DNA loops projecting from the protein core along the fibre length indicates that an established mechanism of protein – DNA interaction operates within the proteinaceous core of the fibre . The ability of full - length SYCP3 to polymerize in a fibre depends critically on N - and C - terminal sequences flanking its helical core [ 26 ] , and homotypic interactions were also found to be important for SYCP3 - DNA fibre formation : SYCP3 1 – 230 , lacking six resi - dues at its C - terminus that are required for self - association but retaining DNA - binding ability , did not form extended fibres in the presence of DNA . Instead , clusters of DNA - bound SYCP3 1 – 230 were detected , in agreement with its behaviour in single - molecule optical tweezer experiments ( electronic sup - plementary material , figure S8 ) [ 30 ] .

The shorter length of the fibre when bound to linear DNA suggests that fibre growth is assisted by a degree of DNA supercoiling , probably because it facilitates DNA bridging by SYCP3 . Inspection of the DNA - bound SYCP3 fibres showed that fibre height was not uniform , with variation along the fibre length ranging from 5 to 30 nm ( figure 4 a , b ; electronic supplementary material , figure S10 ) . A similar height distribution was observed for DNA - free SYCP3 ( figure 4 b ) . Conversely , the height distribution of the DNA - bound SYCP3 1 – 230 fibre was sharper and clustered at around 10 nm ( figure 4 b ) .

Discussion In this paper , we have provided an experimental description of the SYCP3 fibre , in isolation and bound to DNA . We have shown that the filamentous SYCP3 fibres are based on a loose and heterogeneous mode of packing , and that they can readily incorporate DNA into their structure . The homotypic interactions of SYCP3 tetramers within the fibre represent a remarkable example of how a large three - dimensional scaffold can be built rapidly and efficiently out of a small number of homotypic interactions between intrinsi - cally disordered protein regions . Thus , the only apparent inter - particle contacts in the fibre are those between N - and C - terminal tails of the SYCP3 tetramers , leaving the coiled - coil core of the SYCP3 tetramer to act as a strut between layers in the fibre . The strut itself appears to be rather flexible , as demonstrated by our EM analysis and the observation of high B factors in the central region of the crystal structure of SYCP3 ’ s helical core [ 26 ] . The combination of flexible linkages between adjacent SYCP3 molecules and pliability of the SYCP3 helical core endows the fibre with a high degree of plasticity . Thus , rather than a rigid 3D scaffold , the SYCP3 fibre is akin to flexible chain mail . We note that the peculiar structural properties of the SYCP3 fibre described here seem compatible with the pro - posed liquid - crystal properties of the SC [ 42 ] . The plasticity of the SYCP3 fibre highlighted by our data suggests that , rather than fulfilling a structural role in determining chromo - some architecture , SYCP3 might form a protein layer coating the surface of the existing chromosome structure established by meiotic cohesins . The function of such SYCP3 coating might include maintenance of local chromosomal architec - ture , modulating the availability of defined chromosomal domains during recombination , and acting as a recruiting platform for meiotic factors such as the HORMAD proteins and SYCP2 . The relationship between SYCP3 and SYCP2 in LE assem - blyappearsparticularly intimate . The two proteins relyon each other for recruitment to the chromosome axis [ 16 , 19 , 43 , 44 ] . Biochemical and structural studies with purified recombinant proteins have shown a potentially significant difference : whereas SYCP3 can exist as both a homo - tetramer [ 26 , 45 ] and a 2 : 2 SYCP3 - SYCP2 hetero - tetramer [ 45 ] , SYCP2 appears to be stable only as a hetero - tetramer with SYCP3 [ 45 ] . Taken together , this evidence suggests that SYCP3 might exist in two functionally relevant forms , as a homo - tetramer and a SYCP2 - SYCP3 heterotetramer . As both SYCP2 and SYCP3 are coiled - coil proteins , their recruitment to and functional cooperation at the chromosome axis is likely to involve the formation and dynamic rearrangement of homo - and hetero - oligomers . How the spatial and temporal formation of the relevant helical assembly might be regulated is unclear , and it has been suggested that the thermal stability of the coiled - coil assemblies might play a role . The melting temperature of the coiled core region of human SYCP3 , spanning amino acids 66 – 230 , that we had previously measured [ 26 ] shows that human SYCP3 homo - tetramers are highly stable assem - blies . At the end of meiotic prophase , the SC is rapidly disassembled and SYCP3 disappears from the chromosome axis , except for the centromeric region [ 46 , 47 ] . As formation of the SYCP3 fibre is a fast and irreversible process in vitro , SYCP3 removal might require post - translational modifica - tions that weaken its self - association and target it for degradation [ 48 ] . Our AFM experiments provide the first direct evidence for the ability of the SYCP3 fibre to form in the presence of DNA . The array of DNA loops protruding from the DNA - bound SYCP3 fibre indicates that , rather than a sporadic phenomenon , the interaction with DNA is a specific property of the SYCP3 fibre . Although our AFM data do not yield dynamic information about the process of fibre formation , our findings suggest that SYCP3 polymerization on the chromosome axis might be coupled to binding chromosomal DNA loops . What is the functional relationship between the DNA - free and DNA - bound states of the SYCP3 fibre ? A SYCP3 truncation that abolishes fibre formation limits the size of the DNA - bound fibres ( figure 4 a ) , indicating that the DNA - free and DNA - bound states of the fibre share at least some of their homotypic interactions . Conversely , the AFM analysis shows that the DNA - bound fibre lacks the characteristic periodic striations , suggesting that at least some of the underlying interactions between SYCP3 mol - ecules have changed . We did not observe hybrid fibres containing both DNA - bound and DNA - free segments , so their seamless integration might be impossible within the plane of the fibre . However , it is conceivable that DNA - bound and DNA - free forms of the SYCP3 fibre might stack together in a multi - layer structure . The presence of additional SYCP3 on top of a DNA - bound SYCP3 layer might ensure lateral element stability or reinforce the functional insulation of specific chromosomal domains . Our findings provide a structural and mechanistic basis to help unravel the role of the SC lateral element in meiosis . Future investigations will aim to elucidate the interaction mechanism of the SYCP3 fibre with DNA and with other known components of the meiotic chromosome axis . Such studies will be essential to improve our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic recombination and the impact on fertility when such mechanisms become defective . The realization that meiotic gene products , includ - ing SYCP3 , are upregulated in a number of cancers [ 49 , 50 ] further highlights the importance of these studies to under - stand the pathological mechanisms that contribute to genomic instability in human cells .
