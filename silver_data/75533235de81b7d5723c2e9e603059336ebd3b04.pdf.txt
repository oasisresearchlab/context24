Summary The cytoskeleton not only gives cells mechanical stability , but also enables them to exert forces and actively change their shape . It consists of three polymer net - works made of actin , microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments that are further structured by a manifold of proteins . Forces are generated either by polymer - isation , where the elongation of ﬁlaments drives forward motion , or by motor proteins that use chemical energy to actively move along the polymers . How - ever , for functional cellular structures the arrangement of the ﬁlaments is of high importance . To this end , these structures have to self - assemble from their con - stituents in the cytosol , deﬁning directionality , alignment and density gradients . Typically an initial break in symmetry is a prerequisite , which is provided the cell - enveloping membrane in many assemblies . The cytoskeleton shapes the cell , but in turn the cell shape also inﬂuences the organisation of the polymer gel . Investigating the interplay of minimal subsets of proteins with the membrane in reconstituted in vitro and in silico systems will grant insights into mechanisms of dynamic structure formation . In the ﬁrst part of this thesis , an extensile microtubule - kinesin gel is encapsu - lated within a giant unilamellar vesicle , adding both topological and geometrical constraints . The rod - like microtubules form a liquid crystalline layer on the sur - face that has to arrange in speciﬁc patterns to minimise the number of regions without parallel order and maximise their inter - distances . As the kinesin mo - tors apply forces in between the microtubules , the layer is actively driven and the disordered regions – the defects – move . These constraints deﬁne an os - cillatory steady state with a ﬁxed number of four defects , that travel on correl - ated trajectories alternating between a planar and a tetrahedral conﬁguration . Thereby , the oscillation frequency is tunable by the chemical energy input for the motors and the radius of the vesicle . Moreover , the microtubule layer stead - ily expands against membrane elasticity , leading to ellipsoidal shape changes of the vesicle . Lowering membrane tension enhances the deformation amp - litude and initiates the growth of ﬁlopodia - like protrusions , whereas suppressing the shape changes by conﬁnement stalls the defect motion . In smaller ves - icles , a lower number of only two defects is favourable and the microtubules arrange in spindle - like asters or equatorial rings . Due to the ongoing elongation of the microtubule bundles by the motors , these conﬁgurations are also dynamic and exhibit repetitive cycles of motion . The active nematic microtubule vesicles demonstrate how the combination of conﬁnement , continuous propulsion and v symmetry generates ordered dynamical states in hierarchically organised act - ive matter . In contrast to the extensile microtubule - kinesin system , actin - myosin gels cre - ate contractile forces that drive the network into a static compacted state . The effect of boundary conditions on contractile actin networks is investigated in the second part of this thesis . Therefore , geometry and adhesion is varied in both macroscopic setups and microscopic cell - mimic systems . Adhesion guides structure formation by providing forces counteracting the gel contraction . The actin network is pulled towards the anchorage points until the stresses are bal - anced throughout the gel . This either leads to the formation of ﬁbrous con - nections between neighbouring adhesive regions , or to a tensed network within an enclosing bond shell . Depending on the force balance between adhesion strength on the surface and stresses generated by myosin inside the volume , the actin gel is either stabilised or detaches and contracts , where high forces rupture the network . These ﬁndings characterise the basic behaviour over vari - ous length scales . However , in cell - mimic systems the contraction is altered by the recruitment of a dense actin cortex and the accompanying depletion of the vesicle volume . Although the cortex is globally attached , microscopic local detachments occur , leading to bleb formation . Geometry not only comes into play by the system size , but also by the symmetry of the boundaries . Elongated shapes cause the short axis of the gels to contract earlier and stronger than the long axis , as a result of the unbalanced forces at their rim . Taken together , structure formation in actin - myosin gels is a consequence of the boundary con - ditions . Thus , the control of attachment and geometry provides a mechanism to shape the contraction . In addition to motor induced restructuring , network growth conditions are de - cisive for the self - organised assemblies . The third part of this thesis addresses the growth of dendritic actin networks in silico . There , directional force genera - tion and network architecture are tightly regulated by the interplay of the branch nucleator Arp2 / 3 and the growth terminator Capping Protein . This process is coordinated by membrane - bound proteins , which have been widely simpliﬁed in previous in silico models . Including these proteins not only sets natural limit - ations to steady - state network growth , but also generates spatio - temporal pat - terns in the assembly process . Gradients in network density and growth speed emerge , that potentially drive oscillatory reaction diffusion kinetics . In three - dimensional growth , these gradients steer the formation of structures with either inward or outward curvature , which are required to shape the cell membrane . During this process , growth against the membrane adds a load force , to which dendritic networks are known to be responsive . This feedback behaviour is cap - tured by only including geometrical arguments to the binding kinetics . The in silico study sheds light on how consecutive reaction dynamics drive gradient formation in cytoskeletal actin gels . Thereby , it identiﬁes mechanisms to pattern force exertion on the membrane . vi Contents 1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 2 Materials and methods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 2 . 1 Proteins . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 2 . 1 . 1 Actin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 2 . 1 . 2 Tubulin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 2 . 1 . 3 Anillin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 2 . 1 . 4 Fascin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 2 . 1 . 5 α -

Yet all organisms consist of cells , and higher beings are the result of the most complex hierarchical assembly process of morphogenesis . Their bodies are structured in skeletons and organs , which consist of specialised tissues made of polymer matrices and cells . The inside of each cell , in turn , is organised into a cytoskeleton and organelles , which are surrounded by the cytosol . On that level , everything is built from proteins , lipids and ribonucleic acids . By self - organisation , functional structures are formed that deﬁne cellular shape and motion ( Alberts et al . , 1997 ; Misteli , 2001 ) . The cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells consists of three sub - networks made of actin , microtubules and intermediate ﬁlaments , that are regulated by a manifold of auxiliary proteins ( Pollard & Goldman , 2017 ) . These polymers exhibit different properties and each network fulﬁls speciﬁc tasks ( Fig . 1 . 1 ) . Only little is known about the intermediate ﬁlaments , that consist of a broad family of proteins . In general they have a rope - like structure and a diameter of about 10 nm and are found spanning throughout the cell ( Köster et al . , 2015 ) . Microtubules are long , rigid , polar tubes with a diameter of about 25 nm and are known to serve as tracks for intracellular transport , where kinesin and dynein motors walk along them to carry cargo ( Hancock , 2014 ) . Typically , they arrange as an aster in the centre of the cell , however their most prominent task is the formation of the mi - totic spindle during cell division ( Pavin & Tolic , 2016 ) . Moreover , they organise axonal transport and the neural growth cones in the nervous system ( Stiess & Bradke , 2011 ) as well as migratory processes ( Etienne - Manneville , 2013 ) . Actin is the most ubiquitous of the three polymers , present both inside the cell volume and as a cortex on the cell membrane . Its thin ﬁlaments have a diameter of only about 7 nm and are very ﬂexible . Together with crosslinking proteins , they form meshworks and bundles that give the cell mechanical stability . In combin - ation with myosin motor proteins , they build all kinds of contractile structures ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) , like the contractile ring for cell division ( Schwayer et al . , 2016 ) or stress ﬁbres ( Naumanen et al . , 2008 ) . Additionally , cells make use of the forces created by actin polymerisation to protrude their membrane in the lamellipodium for migration ( Krause & Gautreau , 2014 ) or during endocytotic processes ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . 3 Chapter 1 Introduction cortex contractile ring endocytosis lamellipodium stress ﬁbre spindle Figure 1 . 1 : Schematics of fuctional cellular structures . Actin structures are depic - ted in red , microtubules in blue , the cell membrane in cyan and the nucleus or chromo - somes in grey . All these structures are created by self - organised assembly of their constitu - ents . Their growth is controlled by cellular regulation and their composition is highly deﬁned , however they dynamically grow and shrink inside the cytosol Karsenti ( 2008 ) . This complexity impedes a detailed understanding of the role of each protein and the assembly process . An approach to overcome this problem is the in vitro reconstruction of the systems ( Bausch & Kroy , 2006 ) . Thereby , key proteins of the structures are identiﬁed and combined in a controlled manner , so that they can be extensively studied . Bottom - up , the complexity of the min - imal systems is again gradually enhanced , creating cell - mimic systems inside of vesicle membranes ( Brizard & van Esch , 2009 ) . Similarly , the in silico approach implements the protein interactions into mathematical models and simulates the global behaviour of the system ( Di Ventura et al . , 2006 ) . In this thesis , the two approaches are applied to investigate the spatio - temporal organisation of cytoskeletal proteins and their interplay with the cell membrane . Thereby , force generating structures made of extensile microtubule - kinesin gels and contractile actin - myosin gels are studied in vitro and polymer - ising dendritic actin networks are analysed in silico . In the ﬁrst chapter , microtu - bule gels are encapsulated into cell - sized vesicles , following the question , how topological and geometrical conﬁnement determine dynamic vesicle shapes and microtubule organisation . The second chapter investigates the inﬂuence of ad - hesion and asymmetric shapes on the contraction of actin - myosin gels in mac - roscopic systems and cell - mimicking vesicles . In the third chapter , the regulated growth and force exertion of polymerising dendritic networks is simulated , seek - ing for auto - induced assembly patterns and feedback loops . 4 Chapter 2 Materials and methods Active cytoskeletal in vitro gels not only consist of the proteins , but also the reaction buffer and the way how samples are prepared matters as well . This chapter brieﬂy sums up the applied methods and the origin of the reactants . A list of the materials , their origin and abbreviations is given in Table 2 . 1 . Name Abbreviation Source ID - nr .

Each monomer has a diameter of about 5 . 4 nm and the helix has a periodicity of 26 monomers , corresponding to 72 nm . F - actin ﬁlaments are polar and grow and shrink on both ends , where the barbed end – also called " plus end " – polymerises faster than the pointed end – also called " minus end " . Actin is a main component of the cyto - skeleton and is found in all eukaryotic cells ( Howard , 2001 ) . G - actin is puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle by a modiﬁed protocol of Spudich & Watt ( 1971 ) , where a gel ﬁltration step ( Sephacryl S - 300 HR ) is added ( MacLean - Fletcher & Pollard , 1980 ) . It is stored in G - Buffer 2 mM TRIS ( pH 8 ) , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 005 % NaN 3 at 4 ◦ C for no longer than seven days . 1 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - [ ( N - ( 5 - amino - 1 - carboxypentyl ) iminodiacetic acid ) succinyl ] ( Ni salt ) 2 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine - N - [ methoxy ( polyethylene glycol ) - 2000 ] 6 2 . 1 Proteins 2 . 1 . 2 Tubulin Tubulins are a family of globular proteins ( ≈ 55 kDa ) similar to actin . Microtu - bules polymerise from α - and β - tubulin and serve as polar tracks for intracellular transport , most impressively shown in the mitotic spindle ( Howard , 2001 ) . Tu - bulin is puriﬁed from bovine brain and subsequently labelled ( Alexa 647 Ester ) as described in Sanchez et al . ( 2012 ) . It is stored in M2B - buffer ( 80 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 1 mM EGTA and 2 mM MgCl 2 ) at − 80 ◦ C . 2 . 1 . 3 Anillin Anillin is an actin crosslinking protein that also has a binding site for myosin ( Kinoshita et al . , 2002 ) . In vivo it serves as a scaffold protein and is also abund - ant in the contractile ring ; in vitro , it forms branched bundle networks ( Kinoshita et al . , 2002 ) . The interaction with myosin is excluded by using a fragment of Xenopus laevis anillin spanning amino acids 1 - 428 ( Kinoshita et al . , 2002 ) . The fragment was cloned into pET - 28a and puriﬁed from E . coli with His - tags on both termini . Anillin 1 - 428 is stored in 25 mM imidazole ( pH 6 ) , 25 mM KCl , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT ) at − 80 ◦ C . 2 . 1 . 4 Fascin Fascin is a small ( 55 kDa ) monomeric protein that cross - links actin in parallel . In vivo it is known to form actin bundles in ﬁlopodia and ﬁlopodia - like structures ( Vignjevic et al . , 2006 ) . In vitro , low concentrations of fascin form a network with actin , whereas high concentrations pack the actin into polar bundles with a diameter of about 20 actin ﬁlaments ( Claessens et al . , 2008 ) . Here , recombinant human fascin is prepared by a modiﬁcation of the method of Ono et al . ( 1997 ) as described by Vignjevic et al . ( 2003 ) , cloned into E . coli BL21 and stored in 2 mM Tris / HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 150 mM KCl at − 80 ◦ C . 2 . 1 . 5 α - actinin α - actinin is a large crosslinker ( 108 kDa ) that forms dimers Craig & Pollard ( 1982 ) . It is ubiquitous in virtually all cells ( Foley & Young , 2014 ) , where it plays a prominent role in the Z - disk of muscles and in stress ﬁbres ( Sjoblom et al . , 2008 ) . Some of its different isoforms are calcium dependent ( Foley & Young , 2014 ) , which has been shown to be required for contractile ring assembly ( Jay - adev et al . , 2012 ) . Here , the calcium - insensitive isoform α - actinin 1b is cloned into pET - 28c and puriﬁed from E . coli according to Franzot et al . ( 2005 ) , where the TEV - protease cleavage step is omitted to preserve the His - tag for membrane adhesion via Ni - NTA . α - actinin 1b is stored in 20 mM TES ( pH 8 ) , 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT ) at − 80 ◦ C . 7 Chapter 2 Materials and methods 2 . 1 . 6 Myosin - II Myosins are a large family of motor proteins , that are able to move along actin ﬁlaments under use of ATP . While many myosins play a role in intracellular cargo transport , the moysin - II subfamily is the most prominent . Muscle myosin - II gen - erates the contraction of muscles and non - muscle myosin - II is found in the con - tractile ring during division and plays an important role in cell migration ( Howard , 2001 ) . Skeletal muscle myosin - II is isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Mar - gossian & Lowey , 1982 ) and stored in 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 ( pH 6 . 5 ) , 0 . 6 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT and 0 . 005 % NaN 3 at − 80 ◦ C . 2 . 1 . 7 Kinesin - I Kinesins are a family of ATP - hydrolising motor proteins that walk processively along microtubules in eukaryotic cells ( Howard , 2001 ) . The functional 401 amino acid N - terminal domain of kinesin - I is derived from Drosophila melanogaster and fused to the Escherichia coli biotin carboxyl carrier protein ( Young et al . , 1995 ) . The kinesin is also labelled with a six - histidine tag ( Martin et al . , 2010 ) , forming K401 - BIO - 6xHIS - referred to as " kinesin " in this thesis . Kinesin motors are expressed and puriﬁed from E . coli as described in Henkin et al . ( 2014 ) and stored in 50 mM imidazole ( pH 6 . 7 ) , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT , 50 µ M ATP and 36 % sucrose at − 80 ◦ C . 2 . 2 Active mixtures 2 . 2 . 1 Actin - myosin gels Actin - myosin gels are prepared by mixing an inactive sample lacking these two proteins ﬁrst . For a controlled preparation , all solutions are kept on ice . Then , myosin is added and 19 – 21 s later , actin is added and the sample is immedi - ately pipetted into the sample chamber or capillary . During this step of myosin incubation , the salt concentration is ﬁxed at 83 mM KCl , which is achieved by pre - diluting actin in G - buffer , such that a constant volume is added in the ﬁnal step . The deﬁned time interval serves for a rudimentary control of myosin ﬁl - ament length and enhances the reproducibility of the experiments signiﬁcantly . However , better alternatives would be the pre - incubation of myosin - II ( Thoresen et al . , 2013 ) or the use of platelet myosin . For observations on long time scales ( droplet setup ) , 20 mM CP and 0 . 1 mg / ml CPK are added for ATP regeneration . In vesicle experiments , the buffer of the ﬁnal solution is composed of 10 mM im - idazole ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 30 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 2 mM DTT , 1 mM EGTA , 300 mM sucrose and 0 . 5 µ M Alexa488 - ph . All other experiments use 50 mM KCl instead , no sucrose and add 3 % the actin concentration of Alexa488 - ph for la - beling . 8 2 . 3 Giant unilammelar vesicles 2 . 2 . 2 Microtubule - kinesin gels Before mixing the active solution , microtubules and kinesin motor clusters have to be prepared , modifying the protocol of Sanchez et al . ( 2012 ) . Unlabelled and Alexa - 647 - labelled tubulin are polymerised in M2B - buffer in the presence of 0 . 6 mM GMPCPP and 1 mM DTT , to achieve a ﬁnal concentration of 8 mg / ml with a label fraction of 2 . 9 % . After an initial heating step at 37 ◦ C , the micro - tubules are kept at room temperature for two days before use to prepare an average length of 1 µ m . Kinesin – streptavidin complexes are assembled by mix - ing freshly thawed K401 - BIO - 6xHIS solution with SA in M2B - buffer with 1 . 5 mM DTT , to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 32 mg / ml kinesin and 0 . 19 mg / ml SA . After an incubation on ice for at least 10 min , the solution is diluted to 1 . 9 - fold its volume and is ready for use . The ﬁnal active mixture contains 1 . 33 mg / ml micotubules and 11 µ g / ml kin - esin in a buffered solution of 80 mM PIPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 1 . 42 mM ATP , 5 . 5 mM DTT , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA . The volume depletion effect is induced by 0 . 8 % w / w PEG ( 20kDa ) and 300 mM sucrose are added to increase the weight for vesicle production . In order to maintain the ATP concentration , a regeneration system is included , consisting of pyruvate kinase / lactate dehydrogenase and the substrate phosphoenol pyruvate ( 26 units / ml PK / LDH ( 2 . 8 % v / v ) , 26 . 6 mM PEP ) . Finally , antioxidants are added using 2 mM Trolox and a system of catalase , glucose - oxidase with the substrate glucose ( 388 units / ml CAT ( 39 µ g / ml ) , 22 units / ml GOX ( 0 . 22 mg / ml ) , 3 . 3 mg / ml glucose ) . 2 . 3 Giant unilammelar vesicles 2 . 3 . 1 Lipid solutions Lipids are dissolved according as previously published by Claudet et al . ( 2016 ) , whereby a modiﬁcation that improves the encapsulation of proteins is applied for the actin experiments . EggPC - lipids in powder form are dissolved at 50 mg / ml in a chloroform / methanol mixture ( 9 : 1 , v / v ) . In the initial protocol which is used for the microtubule experiments , 95 % EggPC - lipids and 5 % PEG - lipids are dissolved in 200 µ l of chloroform at a controlled humidity of 10 - 15 % . After the chloroform is removed using an exsiccator under vacuum , the lipids are dis - solved in mineral oil in a sonicator and subsequently mixed by a vortexer . In the improved protocol , the chloroform - solved lipids are directly added to 0 . 6 ml decane in a 20 ml glass vial . Then , 9 . 4 ml of a 0 . 175 : 1 silicone oil / mineral oil mixture is rinsed in while gently vortexing . In both protocols , the total lipid con - centration is set to 0 . 5 mM . In the actin experiments , a ﬁxed amount of 2 . 5 % PEG - lipids is used and Ni - NTA - lipids are varied , replacing EggPC - lipids . 2 . 3 . 2 Capillaries Borosilicate glass capillaries of 0 . 5 mm diameter are ﬁrst teared into two with a pipette puller ( Sutter Instruments ) and then the resulting tip is opened us - 9 Chapter 2 Materials and methods ing a microforge , adjusting the capillary diameter . Subsequently , the tip part of the capillary is bent at 90 ° over a ﬂame to create a kink that facilitates the in - troduction in the rotating setup chamber ( see below ) . Then the capillary tip is hydrophobised to prevent wetting on the outer capillary walls : the tip is dipped for 1 min in a solution of 65 % nitric acid to clean the glass , followed by a washing step in a bath of double distilled water . The remaining inner ﬂuid is expelled with a nitrogen ﬂow and afterwards the tip is incubated for 1 min in a silane solution . Finally , the excess of silane is ﬂushed out by a nitrogen ﬂow and the capillaries are baked at 70 – 100 ◦ C for at least 1 h . 2 . 3 . 3 Vesicle encapsulation Giant unilammelar vesicles are produced by the continuous droplet interface crossing encapsulation method ( cDICE ) of Abkarian et al . ( 2011 ) . A cylindrical rotating chamber is successively ﬁlled with a glucose solution to collect the ves - icles , a lipid - in - oil solution to saturate the oil / water interfaces , and decane as the continuous phase in which droplets are formed . 10 – 25 µ l of active mixture solu - tion are injected through a glass capillary , whereby the tip of the capillary was inserted into the decane . Due to an overpressure of about 30 – 100 mbar applied by a Femto - Jet microinjector ( Eppendorf ) , droplets form and detach from the tip because of the centrifugal force . While droplets move through the lipid - in - oil solution , they become coated by a ﬁrst lipid monolayer and then by a second lipid monolayer when they cross the oil / water interface . Thereby , the two mono - layers zip together to form a bilayer . The vesicles are collected in the glucose solution , which is extracted by a micropipette after the chamber stops rotating . For are successful encapsulation , the weight of the protein solution has to be increased , typically by adding 300 mM of sucrose . Furthermore , the osmolarity of the glucose solution must be adjusted to a value 10 – 20 mosmol higher than the one of the encapsulated solution . Capillary tip diameters are chosen between 20 – 40 µ m and the speed of rotation is adjusted accordingly . For high diameters , decane is replaced by a solution containing 70 % decane and 30 % mineral oil to increase the viscosity . The encapsulation of actomyosin is performed inside a cold room ( 5 ◦ C ) to slow down the activity . A fast processing allows to observe vesicles on the microscope 7 – 10 min after mixing . 2 . 4 Microscopy 2 . 4 . 1 Fluorescence microscopy Actin setups and vesicles embedded in actin gels are imaged by standard ﬂuorescence microscopy on a Leica Microscope DMI6000 B inverted micro - scope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) using the objectives HCX PL FLUOTAR 10x / 0 . 3 and the 40x / 1 . 25 CS , 63x / 1 . 4 and 100x / 1 . 4 of the HCX PL APO oil series . If necessary , an appropriate C - mount scaling of 0 . 63x or 0 . 35x is applied . Images are aquired by an Orca ER camera ( Hamamatsu ) . 10 2 . 5 Experimental setups 2 . 4 . 2 Confocal microscopy Vesicles with both microtubule gels and actin , vesicles embedded in actin gels and actin assays with cylindrical geometry are observed by ﬂuorescence mi - croscopy on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wet - zlar , Germany ) using a 63x / 1 . 4 oil ( HCX PL APO CS ) and a 10x / 0 . 3 ( HCX PL FLUOTAR ) objective . Images are acquired using the manufacturers software ACS by the Hybrid Detector ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) and the resonance scanner of the instrument is used for fast three dimensional stack ac - quisition . Alexa 647 is excited with a HeNe laser at 633 nm and an Argon laser line at 488 nm is used for Alexa 488 . 2 . 5 Experimental setups 2 . 5 . 1 Droplet setups Basically , for the macroscopic droplet setups , active mixtures are pipetted into lipid - in - oil solutions . However , it is crucial that the droplets do not ﬂatten too much on their contact area to the coverslip , as this disturbs the contraction and impedes reproducibility . For large droplets ( ≈ 1 µ l ) , ﬂattening could not be avoided by using hydrophobic slides made by silanisation of by addition of sur - factants ( Span20 or Tween80 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) ) . Additionally , the intersection of the surfactants into the bilayer is unclear and thus not favourable , as the lipid composition is essential for the experiments on adhesion strength . A hydrophobic brush is prepared by dissolving paraﬁlm in mineral oil / silicon oil solution . Therefore paraﬁlm is stretched as thin as possible and spanned on a coverslip within a large well ( Fig . 2 . 1a ) . The well is ﬁlled with oil solution and after incubation for at least 4 h the paraﬁlm layer is dissolved and becomes transparent . Droplets are pipetted on top and stay round , rolling around without visible adhesion ( Fig . 2 . 1b ) . Macroscopic observations of the active gel are possible , imaging through the layer , however ﬁne details cannot be resolved ( Fig . 2 . 1c , d ) . To do so , the droplets can be harvested with a cut - off pipette and brought to another chamber . Experiments with a size distribution of droplets are performed on a silanised coverslip . ( Therefore , a simple protocol for silanisation has been developed . A rack of coverslips is stored for > 1 h in a sealed glass box with a solution of 30 ml toluene and 150 µ l Dichlorodimethylsilane ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . After removing the toluene solution , three ﬂushing steps with water and a sonication in ethanol for 5 min , the slides are cleaned in water again and dried in a nitrogen ﬂow . ) Droplets are prepared by shaking 2 µ l of active solution in an 1 . 5 ml eppendorf tube with 500 µ l . Afterwards , 2 % of the surfactant Span20 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) is ad - ded to stabilise the droplets . Later on , the droplets are pipetted on the coverslip . Time series experiments supporting the droplet results are performed using a plate - reader setup ( inﬁnite M1000Pro , Tecan ) . The cylindrical wells with a dia - meter of 0 . 5 mm are coated with BSA to prevent surface adhesion and ﬁlled with a mineral - oil - lipid solution ( 98 % EggPC , 2 % PEG ) as a seal against evaporation 11 Chapter 2 Materials and methods paraﬁlm a b c d coverslip droplet lipid - in - oil sol . Figure 2 . 1 : Droplets on a hydrophobic layer of paraﬁlm . ( a ) Schematic cross - sections of the setup . Colour - code as in ( b ) , acrylic glass frame in grey . Top : Paraﬁlm is stretched and wrapped around a frame . Mid : Then the frame is placed into a match - ing bigger well ﬁlled with a thin layer of lipid - in - oil solution . Bottom : The well is ﬁlled with lipid - in - oil solution and incubated . ( b ) After incubation , the paraﬁlm is dissolved , presumably forming a brush on which droplets of active solution keep their spherical shape . ( c ) Fluorescence microscopy through the layer is possible with good contrast at low magniﬁcations . Orange line denotes the droplet perimeter , cyan is the contracted actin sphere . ( d ) Brightﬁeld image of ( c ) . Bars are 400 µ m . ( Fig . 2 . 2a ) . 100 µ l of active gel solution are pipetted in each well , correspond - ing to a height of 5 mm . Thereby , pre - solutions without actin are pipetted into the wells and activity is initiated by adding myosin and actin within a short time interval of about 1 min each . A spatially resolved intensity measurement at 18 regions of each well detects the contraction , whereby an increase of intensity corresponds to a compaction and a decrease below the initial level tells the contracting gel left that region of the well ( Fig . 2 . 2b ) . The advantage of this ap - proach is , that a high number of samples can be observed simultaneously over a long time , using the identical protein stock . It is worth mentioning , that this cannot be done with the standard droplet setup on an automated microscope stage , as the droplets start rolling around on the paraﬁlm due to inertia . Further - more , the readout demonstrates that contractions of active actin gels can be measured with only a low number of detectors , which may offer the opportunity for high - throughput experiments in microﬂuidic devices or on labs - on - a - chip . 2 . 5 . 2 Vesicle setups Coverslips are coated with casein by incubation for at least 5 min or an acrylamide - brush ( as stated in Sanchez et al . ( 2012 ) ) and afterwards either a cylindrical PDMS chamber 20 µ l or a ring of vacuum grease was placed on them . The vesicle solution is pipetted in using a cut - off 200 µ l tip before the chamber is closed by another coverslip . To increase the stability of the vesicles , the sur - rounding buffer can be matched to the active solution . This is done by mixing a 2 - fold concentrated buffer with the same osmolarity as the glucose solution . The setup for a deswelling experiment places a second 20 µ l PDMS chamber on top of the standard setup instead of the coverslip . After the lower chamber is ﬁlled , a ﬁlter membrane ( 0 . 1 µ m ) that is soaked in the glucose solution is placed on top of it . The second level is set atop and ﬁlled with a glucose solution of the desired the osmolarity . 12 2 . 5 Experimental setups I n t e n s i t y ( a . u . ) T i m e ( s ) a b 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 1002003004000 x y t o p v i e w s i d e v i e w active gel lipid - in - oil sol . well Figure 2 . 2 : Plate reader setup for the measurement of gel contraction .

The inset on the right shows the geometry of the 18 scan regions ( blue circles ) . ( b ) Ex - emplary kymograph of contraction , colour - coding the intensity in each region . As time proceeds ( from bottom to top ) , the intensity in the regions successively falls below a threshold ( black ) , and the gel accumulates in the upper right . For the observation of microtubule vesicles inside actin gels , the osmolarity of the actin buffer is matched to the glucose solution by adding sucrose and glucose . Therefore , a 10 - fold buffer solution is matched to the osmolarity of the 1 M glucose stock . This facilitates balancing the osmotic pressure , as an ini - tial guess can be prepared similar to the vesicle outside glucose solution . For the adjustment it is to point out , that also buffers of antioxidants , labels and re - generation systems contribute to the osmotic pressure . As their contribution is considered to be additive , they are replaced by a place holder glucose solution , saving materials and pipetting time . Actin solutions are prepared with additional 1 % actin seeds , produced by 10 - fold up and down pipetting of a pre - polymerised 10 µ M in a 1 ml syringe ( Hamilton ) . By this , actin polymerisation is sped up , to avoid that vesicles sink to the glass surface . Finally , ﬁrst actin and then the ves - icles are mixed into the buffer , that is subsequently ﬁlled into the setup chamber using cut - off pipette tips . 2 . 5 . 3 Geometry setups Rectangular geometries and channel setups are made of Paraﬁlm . Paraﬁlm is laser cut by a Trotec Engraver ( Trotec , Marchtrenk , Austria ) . For thin , curved channel geometries , Paraﬁlm is left on its supporting paper for cutting and cleaned afterwards in two bathes of ethanol and water using a sonicator . The cut Paraﬁlm is placed on a coverslide , heated up to 70 ◦ C and a coverslip is placed atop , applying a mild pressure . Taller chambers can be build by stacking up layers of Paraﬁlm . In the case of thin channel geometries , the components are plasma activated before assembly to make them hydrophilic . For building a chamber with inverted edge materials , a coverslip is engraved with the laser cutter and carefully broken along the perforation . After connecting coverslide and coverslip with the paraﬁlm as before , the long sides are closed with vacuum grease , leaving an inlet and an outlet . 13 Chapter 2 Materials and methods yz x z lipid - in - oil solution active gel capillary a b c Figure 2 . 3 : Cylindrical gel geometry in capillaries . ( a ) Schematic of the setup . Capillaries are closed with vacuum grease ( brown ) and can be stacked together for imagining . ( b ) Brightﬁeld image , depicting a contracted gel inside a capillary next to the oil - water meniscus . ( c ) Confocal ﬂuorescence images of the gel in ( b ) , showing the central plane ( mid ) and the xz - ( bottom ) and yz - projection ( right ) of a stack . The gel appears broader in the projections due to convolution artifacts . Bars are 200 µ m . The chambers are cooled on ice before injecting the active mixtures to avoid artifacts due to inhomogeneous polymerisation . After ﬁlling , the chambers are sealed with vacuum grease . For evaluation of the aspect ratios , the width of the chambers is determined with a sliding calliper or from stitched microscopy images for small sizes ( < 4 mm ) . Cylindrical setup geometries are built from glass capillaries with a diameter of 0 . 78 mm . An active mixture is prepared in a reaction tube ( Eppendorf ) and covered with lipid - in - oil solution . The two solutions are sucked into the capillary , creating alternating fractions of active gel separated by oil ( Fig . 2 . 3a ) . Due to the resulting meniscus , the samples are only quasi - cylindrical . To take account for that , the length is measured at the wall . Many of the gels curl or are too far away from the objective for precise imaging . In these cases , only the pro - jected lengths are evaluated . Due to these assumptions the ratio of length to diameter is overrated in the initial state and underrated in the ﬁnal state . Thus the measurement serves as a lower limit for elongation during contraction . 2 . 6 Data evaluation All data is evaluated by self - written programs in ImageJ / Fiji ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ; Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) and MATLAB ( The Mathworks ) . Three dimen - sional defect tracking in microtubule vesicles is performed by a stack analysis that dynamically tracks the centre of the vesicles , creates six xyz - hemisphere maximum projections and identiﬁes the enclosing ellipses . The defect patterns are tracked manually and the average coordinates are reconstructed from the six resulting subsets . In the case of low contrast or adjacent bright objects , the stacks are preprocessed by manual cutting or by a dynamic threshold analysis , that detects the steep increase of local maxima at the noise - level . All other analysis are performed using maximum hemisphere z - projections . The analysis of macroscopic actin gels uses stitched images if necessary ( MosaicJ , ( Thevenaz & Unser , 2007 ) ) . In rectangular shapes , long sides are 14 2 . 7 Simulation measured along the central line and the width of the gels is averaged from a set of equidistant lines . Droplet radii are determined from the projected area , whereby samples with deformed non - spherical shapes are discarded . Asym - metric , partly attached gel volumes are estimations . Merged data points in the phase diagram represent one to ﬁve samples . 2 . 7 Simulation Numerical simulations and analytical computation is performed by Mathematica ( Wolfram ) , using the routines Solve and NDSolve . In brief , the network com - position and its temporal development is derived from the kinetic equations of protein interactions by implementation of the corresponding system of partial dif - ferential equations . The main assumption of the model is , that all activity takes place in an active region at the membrane , whereby the back part of the network remains passive . If not stated otherwise , the standard parameter set given by Table 2 . 2 is used .

It is easy to see , that lines cannot be drawn in parallel on a sphere without creating points where the resulting pattern is ill deﬁned . A common ex - ample are the lines of longitude and latitude on a globe , which form aster and ring patterns that diverge at the poles . These necessary singular points are known as topological defects ( Mermin , 1979 ) . Naturally all assemblies of matter have to obey this mathematical law . A closer look reveals this concept behind various phenomena like the ridge patterns of ﬁngerprints ( Penrose , 1965 ) , the organisation of elongated cells ( Elsdale & Wasoff , 1976 ; Gruler et al . , 1999 ) or the alignment of liquid crystals on microscopic length scales ( Chandrasekhar , 1992 ) . They all can be described as an ensemble of rod - like particles that spon - taneously align along a preferred orientation that is locally deﬁned by the dir - ector line ﬁeld . By this , a so called nematic phase is formed , where there is order in the directionality of the particles , however their positions are unordered ( Fig . 3 . 1a ) ( Gramsbergen et al . , 1986 ) . The physics underlying the formation of the nematic phase are of entropic nature and originate from excluded volume effects , e . g . described by Onsager theory ( Onsager , 1949 ; Frenkel , 2015 ) . Mathematically , the nematic phase is quantiﬁed by an orientational order para - meter S which is the average of the second Legendre polynomial : S = (cid:104) P 2 ( cos ( θ ) ) (cid:105) = (cid:28) 3 cos 2 ( θ ) − 1 2 (cid:29) ( 3 . 1 ) where θ is the angle between the particle axis and the director . Therewith a perfect alignment is characterised by S = 1 and a total disorder is found at S = 0 . Furthermore , a topological charge is assigned to the nematic defects , which denotes the rotation of the director ﬁeld when following a closed path encircling the defect ( Vitelli & Nelson , 2006 ; Lopez - Leon et al . , 2011 ) . Thus a charge s rotates the director ﬁeld by 2 πs . The basic nematic defects have charges of + ½ or – ½ , corresponding to a π rotation of the director ﬁeld ( Fig . 3 . 1b ) . According to the Poincaré - Hopf theorem , the charges on a spherical surface add up to + 2 ( Fig . 3 . 1c ) . In material science , the nematic ordering has become a promising building principle to drive self - organisation . The topological constraint forces particles to assemble into highly complex and tunable spatial arrangements , which en - 17 Chapter 3 Extensile microtubule - kinesin gels b θ d isotropic nematic a c + 1 + 1 + ½ - ½ charge sum = + 2 Figure 3 . 1 : Schematics of nematic order and defects . ( a ) Isotropic and nematic phase have in common that the positions of rod - like particles are not ordered . However in the nematic phase the axis are aligned on average parallel to a director d . ( b ) Discon - tinuities in the director ﬁeld are called defects and described by a topological charge , where + 1 means a 360 ° rotation of the director ﬁeld . Only + 1 and + ½ charges are ob - served in the active nematic vesicles . ( c ) Schematic of a nematic phase conﬁned in a spherical topology . A continuous non - vanishing director ﬁeld is not possible , expressed by the Poincaré - Hopf - theorem : the sum of the charges has to be + 2 . able intriguing higher - order hierarchical materials ( Poulin , 1997 ; Musevic et al . , 2006 ) . Previous work in this ﬁeld has focused on equilibrium materials conﬁned on rigid surfaces of varying topology ( Bausch et al . , 2003 ; Moreno - Razo et al . , 2012 ) . As their assembly process relies on equilibration , these systems only show dynamics during their formation while the ﬁnal state is quasi static ( Irvine et al . , 2010 ; Lipowsky et al . , 2005 ) . Subsequent recent studies indeed have created non - equilibrium active nematic liquid crystals , that are propelled by the continuous conversion of chemical to mechanical energy by the rod - like building blocks ( Narayan et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore they make use of biological matter , util - ising rod - like swimming bacteria ( Mushenheim et al . , 2013 ; Zhou et al . , 2014 ) , elongated crawling cells ( Duclos et al . , 2014 ; Kemkemer et al . , 2000 ) , or driving motion by cytoskeletal motors ( Sanchez et al . , 2012 ) . The resulting dynamic systems expose out - of - equilibrium phenomena , such as chaotic ﬂows with con - tinuous defect pair generation and annihilation , that are also subject to current theoretical research ( Thampi et al . , 2013 ; Gao et al . , 2015 ) . In this chapter , a novel system that merges active nematics with topological constraints is investigated . An extensile microtubule - kinesin gel is conﬁned onto the spherical surface of a lipid vesicle . Consequently the nematic microtubule layer has to expose defects with a total charge of + 2 . The steady energy input by the kinesin motors drives defect motion and thereby prohibits relaxation of the nematic to an equilibrium conﬁguration . In contrast an oscillatory steady state is created where the defects move on ﬁxed trajectories passing extremal conﬁgurations . Furthermore the ﬂexible membrane allows the nematic to ex - pand , causing dynamic shape changes of the vesicles as well as the formation of protrusions . When an additional geometrical conﬁnement is set by the ves - icle diameter , various morphologies appear , as different defect conﬁgurations become energetically favourable . Finally a spatial constraint by a surrounding network is shown to be able to stall defect motion . 18 3 . 1 Assembly of active nematic vesicles 3 . 1 Assembly of active nematic vesicles To study the effects of topology on an actively driven liquid crystal , a cytoskeletal gel is conﬁned into the ﬂexible boundary of a vesicle . The active nematic mix - tures have been developed before in the group of Zvonmir Dogic ( Sanchez et al . , 2012 ) . They consist of microtubules , kinesin motor clusters , and the non - adsorbing polymer polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) and are encapsulated into a lipid bilayer membrane by the cDICE method ( Abkarian et al . , 2011 ) ( Fig . 3 . 2a ) . When mixed together the interactions of the constituents drive both structure formation and dynamics . PEG induces both bundling of microtubule ﬁlaments and their adsorption onto the inner leaﬂet of the vesicle by the entropically driven depletion mechanism ( Asakura & Oosawa , 1954 ) . By this the entire vesicle surface becomes coated with microtubule bundles . At high concentrations this leads to a dense monolayer , effectively creating a two - dimensional ( 2D ) nematic cortex with visible defects ( Fig . 3 . 2b , c ) . This cortex is populated by kinesin motors . In contrast to their native appearance as single motors , here the kines - ins are coupled to clusters of up to four individuals by biotin - streptavidin links . While in cells individual kinesins transport cargos along microtubules and walk processively ( Svoboda et al . , 1993 ; Vale et al . , 1996 ) fuelled by energy from adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) hydrolysis ( Schnitzer & Block , 1997 ) , here the kinesin clusters form cross - links with two adjacent microtubules and thus two cases of motion emerge . If the microtubules have the same polarity , the motors on the cluster walk together . Whereas if the microtubules have different polarity , the motors induce the microtubules to slide relative to each other and generate active extensile stresses ( Hentrich & Surrey , 2010 ; Surrey et al . , 2001 ) . 3 . 2 Topological conﬁnement The active nematic microtubule - kinesin mixtures have been studied before on planar surfaces ( Sanchez et al . , 2012 ; Henkin et al . , 2014 ) . These systems are far from equilibrium due to the active energy input by the motors , trans - forming chemical energy from ATP into mechanical movements . The emer - ging active stresses destabilise the homogeneous state of the nematic ( Aditi Simha & Ramaswamy , 2002 ; Voituriez et al . , 2005 ) and generate self - sustained streaming ﬂows ( Marenduzzo et al . , 2007 ) . Thereby the nematic defects be - come motile , interacting through elastic and hydrodynamic forces . Addition - ally , defects with opposing charges are spontaneously created and annihilated , whereby the local charge is conserved ( Giomi et al . , 2013 ; Thampi et al . , 2013 ) . How does this behaviour change when the nematic ﬁlm is conﬁned to the surface of a sphere ? Then the ﬂow ﬁelds of the defects will self - couple and underlie the topological constraint that their charge sum equals + 2 , leading to an oscillatory steady state . The oscillatory state described in this section is analysed in large vesicles ( r > 20 µ m ) with dense cortices . Just as in a passive nematic on a sphere there are four + ½ defects ( Fig . 3 . 3 ) . However the kinesin motor activity generates un - 19 Chapter 3 Extensile microtubule - kinesin gels + - + - + - motor force depletion forces biotin - kinesin s t r e p - t a v i d i n microtubule PEG cDICE ATP PEG motor multimer a + - nematicmicrotubulecortex lipid bilayer 2 4 1 3 2 4 1 3 c b + ½ Figure 3 . 2 : Assembly of active nematic vesicles .

Right : Corresponding hemisphere projection of a confocal microscopy stack . Bar is 20 µ m . balanced stresses that drive the motility of these four + ½ surface - bound defects , which leads to streaming ﬂows of the entire vesicle . Notably , the dynamics of spherical active nematics is simpler than in planar systems . The topology limits the possible defect conﬁgurations by conserving the sum of charges . Thus de - fects cannot disappear and only distinct conﬁgurations of defects are possible . Furthermore , the sphere is a closed system such that travelling defects never encounter a boundary or leave a limited ﬁeld of view . Remarkably , the conﬁnement in the vesicles suppresses spontaneous defect pair creation and hence the four defect conﬁguration is stable and observable over long times . This suppression effect is likely to be a geometrical effect . In all cases , the diameter of the vesicles is well below the length scale l a at which the homogeneously ordered system is unstable to bend deformations . For microtubule - based planar active nematics , l a is estimated to be ≈ 100 µ m ( Sanchez et al . , 2012 ) . 3 . 2 . 1 Oscillatory steady state In equilibrium the free energy of the nematic on a spherical surface can be minimised by multiple arrangements , depending on the elastic constants . If the bend and splay moduli are equal , four + ½ defects are located at the corners 20 3 . 2 Topological conﬁnement 0s 41s 90s Figure 3 . 3 : Dynamics of four + ½ defects on a spherical vesicle surface . Top and bottom rows : Hemisphere projections of a confocal stack of a spherical active nematic vesicle . Four + ½ defects are identiﬁed that show a correlated motion at any time . The sequence shows one period of oscillation in which the four defects move from tetra - hedral conﬁguration ( t = 0 s ) through a planar one ( t = 41 s ) to another tetrahedral one ( t = 90 s ) . Mid row : Schematic illustrating the reconstruction of three dimensional defect coordinates from hemisphere projections . Thereby all x , y and z hemispheres are taken into account . The intermediate times ( t = 24 s , t = 65 s ) visualise the motion of the defects ( black arrowheads ) . Scale bar is 20 µ m . of a tetrahedron inscribed within the sphere ( Lubensky & Prost , 1992 ; Nelson , 2002 ) . This tetrahedral defect conﬁguration is favourable , as it maximises the distances between defects and thereby minimises the elastic energy ( Shin et al . , 2008 ) . However , this conﬁguration cannot be sustained when activity is added . The forces in between the rod - like particles generate collective stresses and ﬂows in the nematic ﬁeld . In extensile systems this results in a propulsion of the + ½ defects towards their heads at a constant speed ( Fig . 3 . 2b ) ( Giomi et al . , 2013 ) . Similar to equilibrium systems , a tetrahedral arrangement of four + ½ defects is found in the active nematic vesicles . However , due to the continuous propul - sion by the motor forces this conﬁguration is only temporary . The favourable minimised repulsion cannot be sustained as the prescribed velocity reduces the distances between the defects . As a consequence , defects move along complex trajectories ( Fig . 3 . 3 , mid row ) . While travelling from one tetrahedral conﬁgura - tion to another , they undergo a planar conﬁguration that offers a symmetric way to pass the unfavourable close inter - distances . The three dimensional trajectories of the defects are further analysed . There - fore , at any given time the positions of the four defects are described by the 21 Chapter 3 Extensile microtubule - kinesin gels a −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 −1 0 1 x y z x y z ff t A m p li t u d e Frequency ( mHz ) 200 400 600 5 10 15 c d b 0 . 05 0 . 15 0 . 25 0 . 35 90° 180° 0° Angle α ij F r e q u e n c y 0 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 108° 112° 116° 120° 121314 232434 90° 180° α ij Time ( s ) 〈 α 〉 pair 104° α ij α ij Figure 3 . 4 : Oscillatory dynamics of topological defects .

By this only the relative movement of the defects is taken into account , because possible global rotations are can - celled out . Hence at any given time , the set of six angles α ij characterises the conﬁguration of the defects . In particular , for a tetrahedral conﬁguration , all angles are α ij = 109 . 5 ° , while for a planar conﬁguration α 12 = α 23 = α 34 = α 41 = 90 ° and α 13 = α 24 = 180 ° ( and permuta - tions ) . Neglecting torsional frustrations of the nematic , the repulsive energy E of the defects can be described proportional to the sum of the squared angular distances . Evaluating the extremal values of E shows how closely the tetrahed - ral and planar conﬁgurations are passed through by the system ( Fig . 3 . 4a and b ) . To further analyse the temporal evolution of all six angles , the average angle serves as a one dimensional measure : (cid:104) α (cid:105) = 1 6 4 (cid:88) i < j = 1 α ij , ( 3 . 2 ) 22 3 . 2 Topological conﬁnement where (cid:104) α (cid:105) planar = 120 ° and (cid:104) α (cid:105) tetra = 109 . 5 ° identify planar or tetrahedral conﬁgur - ations . The trajectories of all six angles reveal a clear pattern of defect motion ( Fig . 3 . 4c ) . For example , at time t = 602 s , two angles assume a large value near 180 ° while the other four are ≈ 90 ° , indicating a planar conﬁguration . Forty - three seconds later , this conﬁguration switches to a tetrahedral conﬁguration in which all angles are equal . Observations on longer time scales demonstrate that the defects repeatedly oscillate between the tetrahedral and planar conﬁgurations , with a well - deﬁned characteristic frequency of 12 mHz ( Fig . 3 . 4d ) . Thereby the frequency is set by the motor speed and the size of the vesicle , and can be tuned by the ATP concentration , which is discussed in the next section . In summary , the results demonstrate how topology affects the behaviour of an active gel . The nematic defects , that exert unpredictable dynamics in a two dimensional layer , obtain a correlated movement when conﬁned to a sphere . Due to the coupling of the ﬂow ﬁelds around the nematics , only distinct tra - jectories are possible minimising the repulsive energies under the constraint of continuous propulsion . These solutions are symmetric among the defects and pass through distinct extremal conﬁgurations , one tetrahedron and one planar . While the tetrahedron obviously is the conﬁguration that maximises the dis - tances between all defects , the planar conﬁguration can be understood as the symmetric solution for the defects to pass each other . This combination of sym - metry , continuous propulsion and repetition of the tetrahedral conﬁguration cre - ates a remarkable oscillatory steady state . Therefore , the ﬁnding of a conserved number of defects is a prerequisite , yet it presumably originates from geomet - rical constraints that are further discussed in the next section . The oscillatory dynamics of spherical nematics can be described by a coarse - grained theor - etical model that handles the defects of the nematic ﬁeld as pseudo - particles , developed by Luca Giomi , Christina Marchetti and Marc Bowick ( Fig . 3 . 5 ) ( Keber et al . , 2014 ) . Recent work is also able to simulate entire active nematic layer by a Landau - de Gennes continuum model , where the active nematic vesicles serve as a validation ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . 3 . 2 . 2 Defect velocity dependencies The oscillatory steady state in spherical active nematic vesicle shows a remark - ably homogeneous movement of the defects . Theory predicts that the defect velocity should be approximately v 0 ∝ ar / η , where a is a parameter describing activity , r is the sphere radius and η is the shear viscosity of the suspension ( Giomi et al . , 2013 ) . It has to be recalled that the defects themselves are not particles , but discon - tinuities in the nematic microtubule layer and their movement originates from the forces exerted by the kinesin motors . Thus the parameter a should be propor - tional to the kinesin motor activity . There about it is known that kinesin is fuelled by ATP and that its enzymatic reaction obeys Michealis - Menten kinetics ( Leibler , 1993 ; Schnitzer & Block , 1997 ) . This behaviour transfers directly to the defect velocities , creating a steep increase at low ATP concentrations ( < 0 . 25 mM ) and saturation above ≈ 1 mM to 1 . 4 µ m / s ( Fig . 3 . 6a ) .

( b ) In the absence of activity , four + ½ sphere - bound disclin - ations relax toward the minimum of their potential energy , with the four defects sitting at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron .

The energy landscape re - veals a minimum for the tetrahedral conﬁguration and a maximum for the planar one . The average angle (cid:104) α (cid:105) does not distinguish between the two equivalent alternating tet - rahedra shown in ( d ) and ( f ) . When described in terms of this coordinate , the dynamics oscillates from the minimum of the plot in ( b ) to the maximum , then back to the same minimum . ( d , e , f ) For active nematics , the defects undergo a self - organised periodic mo - tion : Starting from a passive equilibrium tetrahedral conﬁguration ( d ) , they pass through a planar conﬁguration ( e ) on the way to another tetrahedral conﬁguration ( f ) and then back again periodically .

However this is not contradictory , as the stacking of microtubules into bundles couples the motors effectively in series , adding up their velocit - ies . The found oscillation frequencies are approximately just little higher than 2 πr / v 0 , yet this does not imply the defects move on grand circles ( as shown in Fig . 3 . 3 and 3 . 5 ) . Furthermore the defect velocity is found to increase with the vesicle radius ( Fig . 3 . 7a ) . Small vesicles show a high variance in their defect velocities , because their defect conﬁgurations do not exhibit continuous motion ( Section 3 . 3 . 1 ) . For the spherical four + ½ defect conﬁguration , a trend to a linear de - pendency with a slope of 0 . 035 ± 0 . 007 s − 1 is observable . However , other factors depending on the protein preparation appear to have signiﬁcant inﬂuence , as for example more rigid microtubule bundles slowed down the defect speed . Addi - tionally a direct correlation between the velocities of defects and deformations of the perimeter at the cross section of the vesicles is found , identifying the defects as the direct cause throughout all size regimes ( Fig . 3 . 7b ) . In conclusion the ﬁndings for both defect velocity and frequency as well as the size dependence agree with the theoretical prediction ( v 0 ∝ ar / η ) . However the viscosity parameter η was excluded from the analysis . Hypothetically η also shows a dependence on the activity a ( Giomi et al . , 2013 ) and may also change in the experiment due to the fact that the microtubule surface density should be roughly proportional to the radius . Experimental approaches to vary η would be to change the length or density of the microtubules ( Lin et al . , 2007 ; Henkin et al . , 2014 ) , however other properties of the gel like the collective motor activity may be affected by this as well ( Bieling et al . , 2008 ; Leduc et al . , 2012 ) . 25 Chapter 3 Extensile microtubule - kinesin gels a b 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 Defect velocity ( µm / s ) D e f o r m a t i o n ( µ m / s ) 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 m = 1 15 20 25 30 Radius ( µm ) D e f ec t v e l o c i t y ( µ m / s ) 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 Figure 3 . 7 : Coupling of vesicle shape and defect velocity .

( b ) The shape deformations of the vesicles directly scale with the velocity of the defects . The grey line with slope m = 1 serves for comparison . Marker sizes correspond to the cross section areas of the vesicles . 3 . 3 Geometrical conﬁnement The oscillatory steady state is an amazing example of the way how topological boundary conditions affect the dynamic nematic . While the constraint of topo - logical charge sum conservation is of course valid for any spherical nematics , the other parameter that critically affects the emergent behaviour is the ves - icle diameter ( Elbaum et al . , 1996 ; Nguyen et al . , 2013 ) . Varying the diameter reveals a manifold of morphologies , that exhibit other dynamic defect conﬁgura - tions . Thereby , not only the arrangement of the microtubules changes , but also the vesicle shape is deformed due to the ﬂexible membrane . Here , the different morphologies and the dependency on membrane tension are characterised . 3 . 3 . 1 Vesicle morphologies Vesicles of different size have substantially different appearances ( Fig . 3 . 8 ) . This geometric conﬁnement effect can be qualitatively explained by the energetics of the nematic layer ( Nelson , 2002 ) . One contribution is , that smaller diameters increase the curvature of surface - bound microtubules and thereby the energetic cost . Furthermore , the nematic defects can be described by the sum of defect self - energy terms and contributions dependent on the defect inter - distances . Thus decreasing the accessible area favours a lower defect number . The experimental ﬁndings conﬁrm this view . Vesicles with radii larger than 18 µ m arrange exclusively in the oscillating four + ½ defects conﬁguration . Thereby the vesicles are not necessarily spherical , but can be deformed by the active microtubule layer inside of them . Flexible membranes allow the nematic to expand to ellipsoidal shapes ( Fig . 3 . 8a , Section 3 . 3 . 2 ) 1 and for very high 1 Evidently a sphere is only a special case of an ellipsoid . In the following , ellipsoids with by visual judgement indistinguishable axes are called spheres . 26 3 . 3 Geometrical conﬁnement a b c d 10 12 14 16 18 20 30 0 % 100 % 50 % O cc u r e n ce Radius ( µm ) e + 1 + 1 + ½ D e f ec t c h a r g e P i c t og r a m E x a m p l e i m a g e Figure 3 . 8 : Size - dependent morphology of ﬂexible active nematic vesicles . ( a ) Four + ½ defect vesicles show ellipsoidal shapes if excess membrane is available . ( b ) Very large vesicles ( r ≈ 50 µ m ) also form the oscillatory four + ½ defect nematic , however their shape shows additional bending modes . ( c ) - ( d ) Conﬁned to smaller radii , the nematic shows two + 1 defects . Either the microtubule bundles arrange temporarily in a belt around the equator thereby forming two + 1 ring defects ( c ) , or two aster defects at the poles create a spindle - like conﬁguration ( d ) . ( a ) to ( d ) are projected confocal stacks , bars are 20 µ m . ( e ) The histogram shows the percentage of vesicles displaying a defect conﬁguration as a function of the radius ( total count N = 168 ) . For radii above 18 µ m , all the vesicles exhibit the four + ½ defect conﬁguration discussed above For radii in the range of 10 – 18 µ m , vesicles that undergo continuous transitions between four + ½ defect ( blue ) and ring ( cyan ) conﬁgurations are found - discussed below . The colour code for the defect topology is shown in the pictograms ; some cases remain uncharacterised because of resolution limitations . Figure partly adapted from Keber et al . ( 2014 ) . radii additional bending modes are observable , presumably caused by the an - isotropic elastic properties of the nematic ( Fig . 3 . 8b ) . Even for these vesicles with the highest radii accessible to the vesicle production technique ( ≈ 50 µ m ) the hypothetical transition to a regime of spontaneous defect pair creation and annihilation could not be observed . While the same defects are found for all vesicles at higher radii , the population at smaller radii becomes heterogeneous ( Fig . 3 . 8e ) . There the nematic assumes shapes with two + 1 defects : Ring defects arrange the microtubules in a belt around the equator of spherical ves - icles ( Fig . 3 . 8c ) whereas aster defects on the poles span the microtubules in a spindle - like manner , typically stretching the vesicle axis and protruding bundles at their pinned ends ( Fig . 3 . 8d ) . Both the + 1 defect conﬁgurations show remarkable structure and dynamics . In the ﬁrst type , the equatorial belt formed by ring defects exists only transi - ently ( Fig . 3 . 9a ) . Inside the belt , microtubule bundles move in counter - rotating directions . Thereby the diameter of the microtubule belt increases because of extensile forces driven by the kinesin motors . Conﬁned in a sphere by the ves - 27 Chapter 3 Extensile microtubule - kinesin gels icle hull , the belt buckles out of the equatorial plane , resulting in a saddle shape which resembles the four + ½ defect conﬁguration . Ongoing elongation of the belt drives the defects towards each other until they collide pairwise at the former poles . Then the belt breaks and the open ends fuse laterally to the remaining part , such that a new ring is formed . The sequence starts anew , whereby the average time fraction spent in the ring conﬁguration decreases with the vesicle radius ( Fig . 3 . 9b ) . In the same size regime the second , spindle - like type of + 1 defect vesicles is found ( Fig . 3 . 9c ) . Although it is contentious whether the observed bundle structure is still to be called a nematic , it is notable that the director ﬁeld is ortho - gonal to the one in the ring conﬁguration , spanning lines of longitude instead of lines of latitude . The extensile bundles exert pushing forces against the spindle poles and elongate the structure working against membrane tension . Thereby the central region of the spindle loses connectivity and eventually buckles and breaks when a critical length is reached . Subsequently the membrane drives the shape back into a more spherical shape by folding the old spindle poles together . The bundles redistribute , forming a new aster defect on the opposite side of the vesicle . Hence the original shape is restored and the process repeats multiple times ( Fig . 3 . 9d ) . However it is mentionable that the spindle - like type appears to be unstable . It is possible to observe the transition from spindle to ring structures ( Fig . 3 . 9e ) . After merging the poles the opposite side does not create a new aster defect , but stays rounded . The resulting loop elongates until its ends collide and anneal , forming a ring . An inverse transition is not observed , and thus the number of spindle - like vesicles should decrease over time . Therefore , as the time from vesicle production to observation was not normalised throughout experiments , this type is not included to the histogram ( Fig . 3 . 8e ) . Despite the different appearance of ring and spindle - like vesicles , their dy - namics show a remarkable parallelism ( Fig . 3 . 9f ) . I both cases a low energy state is disturbed by the intrinsic elongation behaviour of the microtubule gel . As the system is conﬁned into a membrane , the required expansion is either limited by elasticity ( spindle - like type ) or by the self - encounter of the nematic layer due to the spherical topology ( ring type ) . This leads to a frustration that is subsequently resolved by a loss of connectivity and a subsequent rearrange - ment of the constituents closer to the low energy state , thereby enabling cyclic behaviour . 3 . 3 . 2 Membrane interaction The effects of geometrical conﬁnement are further investigated on vesicles with a four + ½ defects conﬁguration . Notably their population does not only consist of spheres , but also of ellipsoidal shapes that clearly deform the enclosing mem - brane ( Fig . 3 . 10a ) . Thereby , the nematic activity also leads to displacements of the vesicle , that are however smaller than its diameter . Presumably the vesicles roll back after each axis elongation , causing a persisting rocking motion . While the four + ½ defects can be readily identiﬁed , a detailed tracking was omitted 28 3 . 3 Geometrical conﬁnement a b c 38s 57s 165s 19s 0s 0 50 T i m e ( % ) 12 14 16 18 Radius ( µm ) 25 0min 2min 3min 1min 4min 10 0 20 30 Time ( min ) 4 8 12 16 D i s t a n ce ( µ m ) d 75s 0s 150s 225s 300s e + + f extension frustration connectivity loss rearrangement Figure 3 . 9 : Dynamics of ring - mode and spindle - like vesicles .

Yet the mo - tion can be compared to the spherical case . The oscillatory defect motion in a spherical vesicle also induces small deformations , which can be detected in the projected perimeter ( Fig . 3 . 10b ) . It reveals regions more and less distant to the vesicle centre alternate every π / 2 and have a similar amplitudes , hence typifying an ellipsoidal shape . Their temporal evolution can be described by two counter - rotating angular frequencies , establishing a breathing mode . Similar features can be found in the analysis of ellipsoidal vesicles as well as for very large vesicles ( Fig . 3 . 10d ) , indicating an analogues dynamics . The temporal evaluation of ellipse ratios for different vesicles supports this view , as all distributions transiently pass a ratio close to 1 while being relat - ively symmetric around their median value ( Fig . 3 . 10c ) . Apparently there is no clear dependence on the vesicle radius . However a trend towards more spherical shapes for larger vesicles is observed ( r > 24 µ m ) , in agreement with observations throughout experiments not included to the analysis .

Excess membrane area is provided by applying 10 % hypertonic stress at t = 5 . 2 min . Initially , the vesicle is spherical in the four + ½ defects conﬁguration .

Figure adapted from Keber et al . ( 2014 ) . geneous behaviour suggests that other parameters determine the shape ﬂuctu - ations , supposedly membrane tension . Vesicles offer a unique opportunity to vary membrane tension ( Mui et al . , 1993 ) . It is to recall that membrane tension has its origin in the energy stored in bending modes . Thus the tension is lowered if excess area is available . As the phospholipid membrane is permeable to water , the membrane area changes if an osmotic pressure to the outside solution is applied : A hypertonic stress leads to water leaving the vesicle and consequently the enveloping membrane is larger than required . Deﬂating a spherical vesicle by such a hypertonic stress ( 10 % ) causes re - markable shape changes ( Fig . 3 . 11a ) . First , shape ﬂuctuations become more pronounced while their frequency stays constant , conﬁrming the gradual trans - ition from spherical to ellipsoidal four + ½ defect vesicles ( Fig . 3 . 11b - e ) . Further increase of excess area not only enhances ellipticity , but also causes protrusions 31 Chapter 3 Extensile microtubule - kinesin gels to grow outwards from the defect centres . Subsequently the protrusions grow up to lengths of tens of micrometres and while the vesicle axis ratio further rises to a median value of 1 . 6 until a new steady state is reached after approximately one hour . The high deformation amplitudes in combination with the protrusion travelling with the defects induce a random back and forth motility on the glass slide . Finally , the entire process can be inverted by applying a hypotonic pres - sure . The vesicle re - swells and the ellipticity decreases while the protrusions are retracted again until the initial spherical shape is recovered . Taken together the results demonstrate two ways how the active nematic in - teracts with the membrane . In both cases , the nematic expands as far as mem - brane tension allows it . Forces perpendicular to the membrane are able to in - duce lipid tube formation ( Derenyi et al . , 2002 ; Koster et al . , 2005 ) , where a high excess area is prerequisite . However the lateral expansion uses up such an ex - cess area rapidly , continuously pushing against the membrane . Hypothetically , due to this competition for membrane area , protrusion formation can only be initiated under osmotic shock conditions that provide a high excess membrane faster than the nematic can expand laterally . The resulting ellipsoidal shape re - ﬂects the ﬂow ﬁelds of the defects , elongating the nematic along the forward direction . Interestingly , simulations of passive nematics also predict distorted tetrahedrons if there is high coupling between curvature and orientational order ( Nguyen et al . , 2013 ) . 3 . 4 Network interaction It is topic of current research , how cells couple mechanically to their environ - ment ( Even - Ram & Yamada , 2005 ; Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Typically , the extracellu - lar matrix consists of ﬁbrous polymer networks like collagen and cells bind to it or to their neighbours by specialised adhesion proteins . Thereby a manifold of effects are superimposed and can hardly be separated ( Katz et al . , 2000 ; Kass et al . , 2007 ) . Although active nematic vesicles are evidently far away from being a cell model , they are the ﬁrst cell - sized in vitro system that shows continuous dynamic shape deformations inside a lipid membrane envelope . Here , mech - anical interactions of the vesicles with a surrounding network are tested in both passive and active actin gels . 3 . 4 . 1 Static networks Actin - fascin networks are chosen as a suitable environment , as their properties are well characterised . The reaction buffer is matched to the osmotic pressure of the vesicles such that ellipsoidal phenotypes are caused by excess membrane . During the polymerisation process , that is accelerated by actin seeds ( 1 % ) , the vesicles are trapped in the network . In very weak networks the vesicles sink to the ground . Possibly the elasticity is not sufﬁcient to hold the vesicles in place , but also the slower polymerisation speed due to the lower actin content could allow sinking .

( a ) In soft networks ( 3 µ M actin , 0 . 03 µ M fascin ) , the movement of ellipsoidal is not affected and the surrounding network is compacted .

( d ) Furthermore twisted static shapes are observed in very hard networks ( 3 µ M actin , 3 µ M fascin ) , as shown in the side projection ( right panel ) . Images aquired in standard ( a , b ) and confocal ( c , d ) ﬂuorescence microscopy . Bars are 30 µ m . also sink if the mesh sizes are bigger than their diameter . When the vesicles are embedded in dense but weakly crosslinked networks , they show regular el - lipsoidal motion ( Fig . 3 . 12a ) . Thereby a region around the vesicle is compacted to denser bundles , leaving more space for the vesicle . The network undergoes oscillatory deformations , obeying the forces caused by the vesicle . In the case of a harder bundle network , vesicles are localised inside a mesh ( Fig . 3 . 12b ) . There , they oscillate regularly and the generated forces cause only negligible displacements on the surrounding bundles . In the case of a hard bundle network , the situation is turned around as the network is able to withstand the forces of the nematic . Interestingly ellipsoidal vesicles can become stalled in the middle of dense bundles and stop their os - cillatory defect movement ( Fig . 3 . 12c ) . Hypothetically , the space provided by the breathing mode of the ellipsoid is essential for the energy reduction on the defect trajectories . Once the nematic is expanded to an ellipsoid , the defects cannot pass each other if the shape does not return to a sphere . Simulations also predict the defects to locate at the high curvature regions , suggesting high repulsive energies for travelling towards the central region ( Bates et al . , 2010 ) . This stalling effect is further investigated in section 3 . 4 . 2 . Furthermore , twisted shapes are observed in hard networks where the protrusions of a vesicle are entwined with the bundles ( Fig . 3 . 12d ) . Presumably a stalled ellipsoidal vesicle can transform into such a shape in the presence of excess membrane . 33 Chapter 3 Extensile microtubule - kinesin gels The regimes discussed above demonstrate the mutual interaction of the active vesicle and the network . Depending on the balance of network elasticity and deformation forces caused by the nematic , the system is in between the two limiting cases , where either the vesicle or the network dominate the dynamics . 3 . 4 . 2 Active networks The experiments on vesicles embedded in passive actin network led to the hy - pothesis that a geometrical conﬁnement by the environment is able to stall de - fect motion in the nematic . Admittedly , the emerging heterogeneities in network growth impede a systematic investigation and would make high statistics ne - cessary . Hence the hypothesis is further tested in a different setup , making use of the properties of a contractile actin myosin gel ( 3 µ M actin , 0 . 3 µ M anillin , 0 . 025 µ M myosin - II ) , that applies a successively increasing external force on the vesicles . Indeed , the increasing force load promotes a transition from the oscillatory state to stalling , ﬁnally leading to crushing of the vesicles ( Fig . 3 . 13a ) . Initially ( t (cid:46) 90 s ) , vesicles are found in the oscillatory steady state and also show trans - lational motion . In that phase , the actin polymerises and its loosely connected ﬁlaments do not provide enough elasticity to counteract the forces of the nematic ( Fig . 3 . 13b , left column ) . As the actin ﬁlaments elongate and more crosslinks are established in the network , the connectivity increases . This enables the myosin motors to apply forces , contracting the actin network around the ves - icles . The thereby created pressure works from the outside against the nematic motion , restricting the ellipsoidal elongation . Presumably dependent on the ves - icle radius , the oscillation changes . The smaller vesicles ( r 1 = 18 µ m , r 2 = 20 µ m ) become stalled , while the bigger one ( r 3 = 23 µ m ) continues oscillating until it is crushed , however its translational motion stops ( Fig . 3 . 13b , right column ) . Not - ably the smallest vesicle also stalls earliest , while the amplitudes of the larger one remain widely unchanged ( Fig . 3 . 13c ) . The ﬁndings support the idea of conﬁnement induced stalling , however higher statistics are necessary . A possible size dependence may originate from two effects . On the one hand , forces in the nematic should be proportional to its kin - esin concentration and thus approximately to the vesicle volume . On the other hand , the previous observations have shown , that the four + ½ defect conﬁgura - tion is less stable for smaller radii due to repulsive forces in the nematic layer . 34 3 . 4 Network interaction t 1 t 2 a b c t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 time Figure 3 . 13 : Active vesicles in a contracting actin - myosin gel .

The combination of conﬁnement , continuous propulsion and symmetry generates ordered dynamical states in hierarchically organised active matter . Adding the topological constraint of a conserved defect charge sum on a spherical surface restricts the possible arrangements of the nematic layer . Serendipitously the geometrical conﬁnement suppresses spontaneous defect generation and thus the number of accessible phenotypes is limited , where only either four + ½ defects or two + 1 defects are observed . As a consequence , the behaviour of the nematic defects simpliﬁes compared to the dynamics in a two dimensional layer . An oscillatory steady state emerges , where four + ½ defects travel on distinct trajectories , minimising the repulsive energies in the nematic under continuous propulsion . The dynamics can be described by a theoretical model , and its pre - dicted linear dependencies of defect velocity and oscillation frequency on ves - icle size and energy input are validated . Thereby , the relation between defect speed and ATP concentration is proportional to the one of a single kinesin mo - tor , demonstrating how hierarchically organised matter inherits its macroscopic properties from its molecular building blocks . Furthermore , geometrical conﬁnement leads to a vesicle size dependent vari - ety of morphologies . At smaller sizes , the energy of the nematic is minimised by reducing the number of defects , thereby increasing the distances in between of them . Thus vesicle types with two + 1 defects at the poles emerge , one spindle - like and one forming an equatorial belt . Both have in common that they undergo cycles of nematic expansion , limited by the enclosing membrane . The extensile forces build up a tension that is released by a breakdown and rearrangement of the nematic pattern . This reordering resets the nematic to its original state and hence the motion is repetitive . Inside a ﬂexible membrane , the oscillating nematic assumes ellipsoidal shapes . This indicates for the anisotropy of forces in the nematic layer , as the resulting shape minimises the repulsive energies . If excess membrane is provided under osmotic shock conditions , the ellipticity is increases gradually and protrusions are formed at the positions of the defects . The process is revers - ible and demonstrates how the interplay with the ﬂexible envelope inﬂuences the organisation of the nematic . The behaviour of the nematic is modulated by its environment . Two limiting cases are found in the interplay of the vesicles with a surrounding actin network . Either the vesicle moves freely and the network is elastically deformed , or a hard network causes the nematic to stall . Hypothetically , as there is no more room for ellipsoidal deformations , the repulsive energy prohibits further motion of the defects . Applying an isotropic external force by a contracting actin myosin gel also causes stalling , supporting this idea . 36 Chapter 4 Contractile actin - myosin gels Essential cellular processes include the generation of tensile stresses and con - tractile structures by actomyosin gels ( Murrell et al . , 2015 ) . A prominent example of this is the formation of the contractile ring during cytokinesis , that drives the division of the cell ( Pollard , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ) . However , many more cellu - lar functions rely on contractile forces . Cells maintain a cortical tension ( Lecuit & Lenne , 2007 ; Salbreux et al . , 2012 ) and span stress ﬁbres between focal ad - hesions ( Naumanen et al . , 2008 ) to achieve mechanical stability . Contractile forces actively pull the cell rear forward during cell migration ( Poincloux et al . , 2011 ) and also support the endocytotic machinery ( Sun et al . , 2006 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Lastly , higher organisms developed specialised muscle cells that enable their motion . In muscle cells , the main elements of contractile force generation are organ - ised in a highly ordered manner ( Huxley , 1957b ; Gautel & Djinovic - Carugo , 2016 ) . Filaments of actin and myosin of controlled size are stacked together , building the so - called sarcomere . A contraction is created by a coordinated slid - ing of the ﬁlaments against each other that shortens the sarcomere ( Huxley , 1957a ) . Thereby , each single myosin motor moves towards the plus ends of the polar actin ﬁlaments , and as the myosins are coupled to two - sided ﬁlaments , they stay in place and pull the actin inwards ( Fig . 4 . 1a , b ) . Generally , contractile processes take place in much less ordered active gels , where actin ﬁlaments are connected by crosslink proteins and myosin motors apply contractile forces between them ( Fig . 4 . 1c ) ( Janson et al . , 1991 ) . Thereby , the balance between the motor forces and the crosslink binding is a prerequis - ite for contraction , leading to four major regimes ( Fig . 4 . 1d ) ( Alvarado et al . , 2016 ) . A static network is formed , if the binding forces outmatch the motor forces . In the opposite case , ﬁlaments are only loosely connected and moved around by the myosins in an active solution . Increasing the crosslink density leads to a coarsening and the actin is contracted to local clusters . A further enhanced connectivity establishes gel percolation and causes the network to contract globally . The properties of the gel are not only determined by the protein concentra - tions , but also depend on its internal organisation and cells assemble speciﬁc structures to fulﬁl their various tasks ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , essential processes react to geometrical ( Chen , 1997 ) and mechanical ( Discher et al . , 37 Chapter 4 Contractile actin - myosin gels F - actin myosin ﬁlament G - actin myosin II a b tensed network local contraction active solution global contraction c o nn ec t i v i t y motor activity I II III IV I II III IV d c crosslink Sarcomere Disordered gel crosslinked actin + - + - + - Figure 4 . 1 : Schematics of contractile actin - myosin gels . ( a ) Filamentous ( F ) actin is a polar polymer that attaches globular ( G ) actin monomer subunits mainly on its plus end . Myosin - II is a two - headed motor that multimerises with its tail domain to antisym - metric ﬁlaments . Crosslink proteins are able to connect F - actin . ( b ) In muscle cells , F - actin and myosin ﬁlaments are stacked together in between two anchoring z - disks ( blue ) to build a sarcomere . During contraction , each myosin head binds to actin and moves towards the plus end , leading to a shortening of the sarcomere . ( c ) In dis - ordered gels , the interactions between actin and myosin can also lead to contractions . ( d ) Thereby the balance between crosslink strength and motor forces creates distinct regimes of contractility . Left : Schematic phase diagram . Right : Exemplary microscopy images . Bar is 250 µ m . 2005 ) cues of the environment . In cell division , geometry guides daughter cell positioning ( Théry & Bornens , 2006 ) , cell migration is biased by asymmetric sur - roundings ( Jiang et al . , 2005 ) and tissue morphogenesis is inﬂuenced at many stages by the environment ( Nelson , 2009 ) . Cells grown on two - dimensional ad - hesive patterns adjust their stress ﬁbre conﬁguration ( Théry et al . , 2006 ) , and the tissue formation rate of osteoblasts has been shown to react to three dimen - sional matrices ( Rumpler et al . , 2008 ) . Since all intracellular processes underlie complex biochemical regulation , in vitro approaches investigate the behaviour of isolated active gels ( Bausch & Kroy , 2006 ; Vignaud et al . , 2012 ) . In these it has been shown that myosin activity alone creates ordered structures ( Reymann et al . , 2012 ) , how network connectivity affects the contractile behaviour ( Alvarado et al . , 2013 ) and that conﬁnement leads to alignment of actin ( Claessens et al . , 2006 ; Silva et al . , 2011 ) . Further studies reconstituted stress ﬁbre assembly on adhesion com - plexes ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2012 ) as well as contractile rings ( Miyazaki et al . , 2015 ) and worked towards cell - mimicking vesicles ( Tsai et al . , 2011 ; Carvalho et al . , 2013 ) . 38 4 . 1 Symmetric boundaries In this study , the inﬂuence of geometry and adhesion on macroscopic active gels is investigated and set into context with a cell - mimic system . A focus is set on globally contracting systems , which are further characterised , including be - haviour that occurs over long time scales . In symmetric geometries , the balance between contractile forces and surface adhesion is varied , identifying regimes of network stabilisation , detachment and rupture . This behaviour is altered in cell - sized vesicles by the redistribution of actin to a cortex - like structure . Remark - ably , afﬁne contractions are only found for symmetrical geometries , whereas an asymmetry in the starting conditions leads to disturbances within the gel that develop differently over time . Elongated shapes enhance their side aspect ratio over time during contraction , as a result of their local force balances . 4 . 1 Symmetric boundaries The design of in vitro experiments requires the active actin gel to be enclosed in a reaction chamber . As the characteristics of this container will be imprin - ted on the contracting gel , reproducibility demands for controlled environments . Thereby , the inﬂuence of geometry is minimised in a spherical symmetry , as it is provided by droplets or vesicles . While advantages of macroscopic droplets are an easy production process with sharply deﬁned sizes and a higher robustness to stochastic deviations , the encapsulation into a vesicle creates a cell - mimic system , in which the interactions of the actin cytoskeleton with the membrane can be tested . 4 . 1 . 1 Contractile forces and network elasticity Inside the active gel , myosin motors create contractile forces that act against the crosslink dependent network elasticity . While the regimes of contractility are well studied ( Bendix et al . , 2008 ; Alvarado et al . , 2013 ) , here the balance between myosin and crosslink concentration is investigated in higher detail with a focus on the ﬁnal contracted state . Active solutions of actin , myosin and anillin macroscopic droplets ( V = 2 µ l ) contract approximately as shape - preserving spheres and their initial and ﬁnal radii ( r i = 0 . 78 mm , r f ) are evaluated ( Fig . 4 . 2a ) , quantiﬁed by the contraction ra - tio R = V f / V i . In the case of low crosslinking ( c ani ≤ 56 nM ) , the active solutions stay homogeneous . At higher linkage , a threshold myosin concentration ( c myo = 3 nM ) separates a non - contractile and a globally contracting regime . In the non - contractile regime , tensed networks are formed ( Fig . 4 . 2c ) of which some do not span the entire drop volume anymore ( Fig . 4 . 2d ) . Above the threshold , the gels contract to very dense spheres of only less than one tenth the drop diameter , where higher myosin content returns bigger spheres ( Fig . 4 . 2e - g ) . While the ﬁnal contraction ratios do not differ signiﬁcantly for higher crosslink concentrations ( c ani = 167 nM and c ani = 500 nM ) , harder gels contract more slowly 39 Chapter 4 Contractile actin - myosin gels c d e f g c ( Myo ) 100nM c ( Myo ) 25nM c ( Myo ) 3 . 2nM c ( Myo ) 1 . 6nM c ( Myo ) 0 . 4nM C o n t r ac t i o n R a t i o V f / V i 10 - 1 10 - 2 10 0 10 - 3 a b T i m e ( m i n ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 10 0 10 1 10 2 Myosin - II ( nM ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 Myosin - II ( nM ) Anillin , Time 500nM , 500nM , 56nM , 167nM , 167nM , 500nM , 2h 2h 24h 18h 24h 2h Figure 4 . 2 : Spherical contraction in macroscopic droplets .

Stitched images for ( c ) and ( d ) . Bars are 500 µ m . ( Fig . 4 . 2a ) . Thereby , higher myosin contents speed up the contraction , where the scaling is notably faster than exponential ( Fig . 4 . 2b ) . In the contractile regime , the gels contract to small spheres of similar sizes . The dependency of the contraction ratio on the protein concentrations is fur - ther analysed . For different droplet sizes , initial and ﬁnal volume are directly proportional , suggesting that surface to volume effects do not come into play ( Fig . 4 . 3a ) . Furthermore , keeping the stoichiometry of the constituents constant ( c a : c ani : c myo = 1 : 0 . 1 : 0 . 01 ) , the contraction ratios increase with the total concen - tration ( Fig . 4 . 3b ) . Thereby R increases steeper than linear , presumably propor - tional to c 3 a . Interestingly , higher myosin concentrations do not further decrease the ﬁnal volume , but an increase is found ( Fig . 4 . 3c ) . Although the contraction accumulates the material to a dense sphere , the ﬂuorescence intensity of labelled actin indicates that the surrounding droplet still contains a residual gel ( Fig . 4 . 4a ) . As there is no more visible activity , the gel presumably is either a tensed network or an unconnected solution . SDS gels suggest the latter case , as only very few anillin is found in the residual gel . To further test it , more crosslinks ( 0 . 2 µ l , 65 µ M ) are added to contracted gel in a droplet ( 2 µ l ) . Indeed the residual gel starts contracting , whereby a global motion also translates the sphere ( Fig . 4 . 4b , c ) . However , it still has to be excluded that the mechanical perturbation caused the effect . 40 4 . 1 Symmetric boundaries a 0 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 V f ( 10 6 µ m 3 ) V i ( mm 3 ) Actin 14µM 5µM 0 5 10 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 V f / V i ( 10 - 3 ) Actin ( µM ) b c 10 2 10 1 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 Myosin ( nM ) V f / V 5 10 15 0 40 80 120 160 r ( µ m ) Figure 4 . 3 : Final compacted state .

Right : At t = 15min , the gel is still contracting . ( c ) Intensity proﬁles along the kymograph line , aligned to the sphere position . The contracting residual gel adds a side peak next to the sphere . In conclusion , already small amounts of myosin are sufﬁcient to contract actin networks , where network elasticity does only inﬂuence the velocity , but not the ﬁnal state . Thus a balance between contractile forces and network elasticity is only reached at very dense states , or its observation would require a higher sampling around the threshold concentration . While the compacted states ﬁt well a ratchet - like mechanism , the highly different contraction speeds require an additional explanation , as the increase of speed by a series of ratchets is proportional to their number . A threshold behaviour is also predicted by theory , however with a shift of the transition for higher linkage ( Wang & Wolynes , 2012 ) . The identiﬁed threshold of about c myo = 3 nM , above which gels contract to dense spheres , corresponds to an average spacing of approximately 5 µ m between myosin ﬁlaments of 200 subunits in the initial solution . Interestingly , recent studies also ﬁnd different 41 Chapter 4 Contractile actin - myosin gels contractile regimes for a motor spacing in the range of 1 – 20 µ m , where forces are transmitted more effectively ( Ronceray et al . , 2016 ) . Critically reviewing the time - lapse data on the contraction speed , it yet cannot be excluded that the observed threshold would vanish for even longer observation times . Additionally , some data suggests that there is residual adhesion that prevents contraction ( Fig . 4 . 2d ) . The density in the ﬁnal contracted state is discussed in context with protein sizes . Assuming a dense packing of 5 µ M G - actin ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) returns a compaction to 0 . 4 × 10 − 3 of the solution volume , in the same range as found for the contraction ratios . Although certainly not all actin is accumulated in the sphere , this underlines the high packing ratio and suggests sterical arguments to limit the ﬁnal volume . Following the idea that actin determines the ﬁnal volume , the increase of R for higher actin concentrations can be understood , if polymerisation is taken into ac - count . As the residual gel suggests , that polymerisation is not completed before contraction , faster polymerisation should lead to higher volumes . Indeed , as - suming the nucleation process to go with c 3a returns the notional linear increase of the radius . An analogous estimate may explain the increase of R for high c myo . A dense packing of myosin ﬁlaments ( Skubiszak & Kowalczyk , 2002 ) returns a ratio of 0 . 2 × 10 − 3 for c myo = 100 nM with a linear dependence on c myo . This is in the same range as found for actin and thus higher myosin contents could set a ster - ical limit , too . An alternative explanation is found in the crosslinking behaviour of myosin ﬁlaments due to the motor duty ratio , that could increase the elastic modulus and impede further contraction . However , it is likely that higher mo - tor activity leads to more buckling of ﬁlaments that induces breakage and in turn more actin plus ends for polymerisation ( Murrell & Gardel , 2012 ) . A recent simulation has shown that buckling - induced fragmentation alone modulates the contraction , due to structural changes . Larger ﬁnal clusters are found for more myosin at certain levels of crosslinking ( Li et al . , 2017 ) . Presumably , including polymerisation will increase that effect . The more myosin , the faster the con - traction , which means the fragmentation takes places earlier , when there is still more actin to polymerise . Hypothetically , the overall behaviour with an elasticity dependent velocity and similar ﬁnal states is a consequence of the transient behaviour of the crosslinks . On short time scales , motors work against the elasticity , thereby possibly stalling in a rigid mesh . Whereas on long time scales , neighbouring crosslinks randomly detach , such that the mesh can be further compactiﬁed by the motor . This could be experimentally tested by introducing stable biotin - streptavidin bonds between the actin ﬁlaments . Further studies may also elucidate the effect of the polymerisation process in parallel to the contraction , that presumably highly inﬂuences fast contracting gels . Therefore , the residual gels should be analysed quantitatively , e . g . by SDS gels and optical density measurements , which would also further characterise their non - contractile state . Finally , fully polymerised gels could be investigated in systems with switchable contractility ( Schuppler et al . , 2016 ) . 42 4 . 1 Symmetric boundaries 4 . 1 . 2 Lipid membrane adhesion An important part of the cytoskeleton is the cell cortex , where a layer of actin is recruited to the phospholipid membrane . Its composition and force gener - ation are key factors in processes like morphogenesis ( Salbreux et al . , 2012 ) , development ( Paluch & Heisenberg , 2009 ) or migration ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) . In vitro systems investigate the interplay of active gels with supported bilayers ( Murrell et al . , 2011 ; Koster et al . , 2016 ) . However , vesicle cell mimic systems previous to this study have mainly investigated passive cortices ( Berndl et al . , 1990 ; Merkle et al . , 2008 ) , or bound an active cortex from outside to the vesicle ( Carvalho et al . , 2013 ) and only few reconstructed an active cortex from inside the ves - icle ( Tsai et al . , 2011 ) . Here , the balance of force generation and adhesion is tested in droplets and vesicles with functionalised lipids and the comparability of microscopic and macroscopic setups is discussed . The fate of contractile actin - myosin gels is crucially affected by surface adhe - sion . Sufﬁciently high anchorage prevents gels from contraction and results in tensed networks ( Fig . 4 . 5a ) . To implement adhesive and non - adhesive mem - branes in a cell mimic vesicle , the active gels are encapsulated in functionalised lipids ( Abkarian et al . , 2011 ) . Thereby polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) lipids create a repulsive coating that prevents unspeciﬁc binding to the membrane . Adhesion is mediated by crosslinkers with a His - tag that binds to Ni - NTA - groups on the lip - ids ( Fig . 4 . 5b ) . The Ni - NTA density adjusts the adhesion strength , which allows switching between volume spanning networks or cortices ( Loiseau et al . , 2016 ) . A shortcoming of the approach is , that the same crosslink both binds inside the network and mediates adhesion . This could be improved by using a His - tagged protein with only one actin binding site or even physiological membrane linkers , like ezrin . The effect of crosstalk between bulk and membrane binding depends on the surface to volume ratio , and thus is minimised in macroscopic assays . Varying the adhesion strength in macroscopic droplets ( V = 1 . 8 µ l ) results in different phenotypes of contracted gels ( Fig . 4 . 6a ) . Depending on myosin con - centration and Ni - NTA - lipid content , distinct regimes emerge ( Fig . 4 . 6b ) . For passivated surfaces ( 2 . 5 % PEG lipids ) , the gels contract widely keeping their spherical shape as observed in Section 4 . 1 . 1 , where for low myosin concentra - tions the contraction stalls at larger radii . If a low amount of Ni - NTA lipids is added , a threshold for contraction is found at about c myo = 1 . 6 – 3 . 1 nM . Below the threshold , the gels are adhered and form tensed networks , whereas above it the usual contraction is observed . This changes , if the adhesion is further en - hanced . Higher myosin concentrations ( > 1 . 6 nM ) rupture the network , leaving behind a cortex - like structure ( Fig . 4 . 6c ) . Thereby , intermediate myosin levels ( 3 . 1 – 6 . 3 nM ) return partly contracted networks , while high levels ( > 6 . 3 nM ) again form spheres . The force ranges of the identiﬁed regimes of detachment , stabilisation and rupture can be estimated . Under the assumptions that each motor creates an average force of 0 . 42 pN ( Guilford et al . , 1997 ) and that all forces in the volume are transduced as stresses to the surface ( Ronceray et al . , 2016 ) , an upper limit for the stress on the surface σ maxmyo is found . The counteracting maximal possible adhesion strength σ maxbind is estimated from the area per lipid ( 0 . 7 nm 2 ) and the 43 Chapter 4 Contractile actin - myosin gels Ni - NTA lipid 2 . 5 % PEG 0 . 1 % NiNTA Anillin - His F - actin Anillin F - actin PEG lipid a b Figure 4 . 5 : Adhesion organises actin - myosin gels in cell mimicking vesicles .

( a ) The same active gel ( 3 µ M actin , 0 . 3 µ M α - actinin , 0 . 1 µ M myosin ) inside vesicles with functionalised membranes contracts differently . While a passivated surface leads to a global contraction ( left ) , adhesion recruits a cortex - like layer of actin to the membrane , which stabilises the net - work . Higher linkage leads to a pronounced cortex and a depleted bulk ( see Fig . 4 . 8 ) . Mid : Schematic view , as in ( b ) . Images are confocal slices of the equatorial plane of the vesicles . Stroked line ( left ) indicates the vesicles perimeter . Bars are 20 µ m . ( b ) Schematic of membrane functionalisation . strength of a streptavidin - biotin bond at low loading rates ( 5 pN ) ( Merkel et al . , 1999 ) , as no data on anillin was found . However , the bond dynamics are much more complicated , as also the His - tag is only transient ( Schmidt et al . , 2002 ) . Analysis on the anillin - His Ni - NTA system showed , that approximately 1 % of the Ni - NTA sites is occupied on average ( Loiseau et al . , 2016 ) . Relating these estimations to the data ﬁnds a stalled contraction in the range of 50 Pa , in good agreement with the compression modulus for the actin anillin network , that is ≈ 20 Pa 1 and increases during contraction . Regarding the point of detachment at low Ni - NTA , the contractile stress is in the range of 100 – 200 Pa , which results in a force per bond of about 10 pN with the assumed 1 % occupa - tion . Increasing adhesion leads to the rupture regime , where presumably the force to detach the membrane linkers is greater than the yield strength of the network - where typical values are on the 100 Pa scale ( Schmoller et al . , 2009 ) . The hypothesis of network rupture at yield strength is further tested by enhan - cing the network elasticity ( Fig . 4 . 6d ) . Under the assumption , that the elasticity of the semiﬂexible polymer network at ﬁxed crosslink ratio ( c a : c ani = 1 : 0 . 1 ) scales by c 2 . 5 a and that the yield strength is approximately proportional to it ( MacKintosh et al . , 1995 ; Schmoller et al . , 2009 ) , an increase of c a by a factor of two should 1 Calculated from a rheologically determined elastic modulus of ≈ 10 Pa and a poisson factor for gels of ν = 0 . 3 . 44 4 . 1 Symmetric boundaries 0 . 1 - 10 % Ni - NTA 10 % Ni - NTA 10 % Ni - NTA 0 % Ni - NTA 1 % Ni - NTA 0 - 0 . 1 % Ni - NTA adhered partly adhered linker detached detached , large network rupture Detachment Rupture M y o s i n ( n M ) 20 2 Actin ( µM ) 5 10 20 30 1 . 0 % Ni - NTA a b c d stabilise rupture detach M y o s i n ( n M ) Ni - NTA % 0 0 . 1 1 . 0 10 10 0 10 1 10 2 0 . 07 0 . 7 6 . 6 0 7 70 700 σ bind ( kPa ) max σ m y o ( k P a ) m a x Figure 4 . 6 : Adhesion modulates the contraction in macroscopic droplets .

( a ) A poly - disperse ensemble of droplets ( c a = 5 µ M , c ani = 0 . 5 µ M , c myo = 25 nM ) , 0 . 1 % Ni - NTA lipids , 2 . 5 % PEG lipids ) contains both adhered and contracted phenotypes . As bulk networks exhibit an overall brightness , whereas contracted spheres have both very dark and very bright values , they ca be automatically characterised by the inhomogeneity of the in - tensity , deﬁned by its standard deviation divided by its mean ( numbers ) . ( b ) Radius dependent adhesion and contraction , classiﬁed by inhomogeneity ( red threshold line to guide the eye ) . The transition between stabilised and detached regime is in between r = 60 µ m and r = 100 µ m , which corresponds to the same surface stress as found for macroscopic droplets ( σ maxmyo = 100 – 200 Pa ) . Bars are 30 µ m . require about 5 . 5 - fold the motor force . Indeed the networks are stabilised and the boundary to the rupture regime is shifted by a factor greater than two . It remains the question , in how far the results from macroscopic droplets can be applied for cell - sized systems . One testable prediction is obtained from the surface to volume ratio : At given adhesion surface density and motor volume density , the force per link increases linearly with the radius . Thus the boundary between contractile and stabilised regime should depend on the droplet dia - meter . Indeed , in a polydisperse ensemble of droplets ( c a = 5 µ M , c ani = 0 . 5 µ M , c myo = 25 nM ) , 0 . 1 % Ni - NTA lipids , 2 . 5 % PEG lipids ) the two phenotypes are ob - servable ( Fig . 4 . 7a ) . At low radii ( < 60 µ m ) , nearly all gels are adhered to the surface , while at high radii ( < 100 µ m ) all are contracted ( Fig . 4 . 7b ) . This means the transition takes place in the same force range as found in the macroscopic droplets 100 – 200 Pa , conﬁrming the predicted surface to volume effect . On the microscopic scale , active gels are encapsulated into giant unilamellar vesicles using the same adhesion system ( Anillin - His / Ni - NTA ) ( Loiseau et al . , 2016 ) . A high fraction of Ni - NTA - lipids ( 10 % ) is necessary for cortex formation . Thereby the detailed number of links can be estimated from ﬂuorescence data and also depends on the Anillin concentration . The balance between adhesive and contractile forces deﬁnes a phase diagram ( Fig . 4 . 8 ) . At low inter - linker dis - tances ( (cid:54) 31 nm ) , high amounts of actin are recruited to the membrane forming a cortex - like layer , while only a weak bulk network resides . In the case of high inter - linker densities ( (cid:62) 145 nm ) , no discernible cortex is detected and the gel forms a volume spanning network . In this regime , the results are comparable to the ﬁndings in macroscopic droplets . At low myosin forces , adhesion stabil - ises a tensed network ( Fig . 4 . 8f ) , while higher forces are able to detach the gel , 46 4 . 1 Symmetric boundaries cortex - like network 208 nm 25 nm blebbingno bleb 10 % Ni - NTA 10 µM actin Inter - linker distance M y o s i n ( µ M ) Anillin ( µM ) 0 . 1 0 . 2 1 . 0 1 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 volume spanning network 145 nm 31 nm σ m y o ( k P a ) m a x σ bind ( kPa ) 0 . 12 0 . 24 5 . 2 8 . 0 0 0 . 6 1 . 2 a b c d f e g h Figure 4 . 8 : Adhesion and detachment in cell - mimicking vesicles . A high linker density induces cortex formation , independently of the presence of myosin ( g , h ) . At low linker densities , a volume spanning network is formed that exhibits similar behaviour as observed macroscopically , where the network can be stabilised ( f ) , or detach fully or partly ( a , b ) . Membrane detachment causes blebs , of which the size decreases with in - creasing linker density ( c ) until blebbing is fully suppressed for very strong attachments ( d ) . Bars are 20 µ m . Figure adapted from Loiseau et al . ( 2016 ) . leading to a full or partial contraction ( Fig . 4 . 8a , b ) . While the attached gel con - tracts , the detached membrane forms blebs due to the internal overpressure . Even in the regime of cortex formation , microscopic blebs occur , indicating local detachments that can be only suppressed at very high linker densities . Overall , vesicles with cortices exhibit distorted shapes in the presence of myosin forces . Due to their very different network structure , they are not comparable to the droplets . However , analogues estimations for the maximal stress σ maxmyo ( 0 . 42 pN per motor , r = 18 µ m ) and adhesion σ bind ( 5 pN per link ) predict the global stabil - isation . In the low adhesion regime , the estimate ﬁts well for the detachment ( Fig . 4 . 8a , b ) , but the motor force exceeds adhesion where a stabilised network is found ( Fig . 4 . 8f ) . Allowing a mismatch factor of six for the calculated stresses both explains the stabilised case and returns values close to equilibrium for the partial detachment . This discrepancy is comparably small , as the inter - linker distances are also estimations and the myosin stress denotes an upper limit . In conclusion , adhesion inﬂuences both structure and dynamics of contractile actin gels . Low afﬁnities to the surface counteract contraction , while high link - age leads to the formation of a dense cortical layer . By this , tensed networks are formed that either detach or rupture upon high myosin forces , presumably 47 Chapter 4 Contractile actin - myosin gels dependent on the ratio between adhesion and yield strength . Importantly , the surface to volume effect comes into play , scaling the stress on the surface lin - early with the radius of the droplet or vesicle . Therewith , macroscopic results can be compared to microscopic cell - mimic systems . Major deviations from this relation are caused by the formation of the cortical layer , that affects a higher fraction of the network at smaller length scales . An investigation of this discrep - ancy could shed light on structure and formation of cortical layers ( Loiseau et al . , 2016 ; Lecuit & Lenne , 2007 ) . 4 . 2 Asymmetric boundaries While spherical systems are favourable to study the behaviour of the contractile gels , the situation in cells is more complicated as they are asymmetric objects . Cells not only use their actin cytoskeleton to change their shape , but also react to the shape of their environment , e . g . adapting stress ﬁbre alignment ( Théry et al . , 2006 ) or signalling during differentiation ( Kilian et al . , 2010 ) . Evidently these processes underlie cellular regulation , however little is known on the inﬂuence of geometry on the contraction of active actin gels alone . In the common picture the gels can be seen as ensemble of contractile units of which each is scaled by the contraction ratio , leading to an isotropic , shape preserving contraction . Here , the behaviour in asymmetric environments is tested . 4 . 2 . 1 Aspect ratio geometries A basic asymmetry is given by a rectangular geometry with a long x - axis and a short y - axis . In macroscopic assays ( x ≈ 10 mm ) with ﬁxed z - direction ( z ≈ 120 µ m ) , the aspect ratio of the initial rectangular chamber R i = y i / x i is varied . The ﬁnal contracted states still have rectangular shapes , however , the ﬁnal shape is more elongated than the initial . For high aspect ratios ( R i > 10 ) this trend continues , however the gels typically fracture . Moreover , bright edges and rufﬂes are observed ( Fig . 4 . 9a ) . Elongated initial shapes cause even more elongated ﬁnal shapes ( R f > R i ) , whereby the contraction of the short side gets stronger ( R y < R x ) at higher R i ( Fig . 4 . 9b ) . To exclude that the effect origin - ates from adhesion , the materials of the chamber edges are swapped , returning similar results . Exemplary samples with doubled z - height follow the same trend , however the elongation effect may be less pronounced . To further investigate the inﬂuence of the third dimension , a quasi - cylindrical geometry is chosen , where the gel is ﬁlled into a capillary ( r = 0 . 25 mm ) enclosed by a lipid oil solution . After contraction , the ﬁnal states also exhibit elongated shapes ( R f > R i ) and do not fracture at higher aspect ratios ( Fig . 4 . 9c ) . How - ever , only a lower limit for R f can be determined , as optical distortions caused by the capillary walls impede a precise three dimensional measurement . The study is continued in a microscopic setup , where arbitrary shapes of the contractile gel can be deﬁned by light activation ( Schuppler et al . , 2016 ) . There , ﬁnal and initial ratio are equal , however the sides of rectangles contract at dif - 48 4 . 2 Asymmetric boundaries x y a R i = 1 . 33 R i = 2 R i = 3 R i = 3 . 6 R i = 4 . 5 R i = 6 R i = 9 b 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 2 4 6 8 Initial ratio R i F i n a l r a t i o R f 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Initial ratio R i F i n a l r a t i o R f c 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 2 4 6 8 R x R i R y R max R maxmodel Cyl ( b ) R i = 22 , 41 x f ~ Figure 4 . 9 : Asymmetric boundaries induce non - isotropic contraction .

( c ) Comparison of ( b ) ( blue ) with the maximal aspect ratio measured in a microscopic setup and its model ﬁt ( R max ( green ) , R modelmax ( purple ) ) ( Schuppler et al . , 2016 ) . The effect is also observable with a non - vanishing third dimension , in cylindrical gels . Due to setup limitations , only the x - projected length ˜ x f is measured ( inset ) and thus the plot ( red ) depicts a lower limit . ferent speeds and thus a maximal aspect ratio R max emerges . The behaviour of R max is similar to the elongated shapes observed in the macroscopic setups ( Fig . 4 . 9c ) . A possible explanation is found in the network connectivity . In con - trast to the macroscopic setup , the microscopic gel does not use crosslinkers , but gains its elasticity from entanglements of the actin and connections from the myosin ﬁlaments . This should result in more dynamic reordering , while the crosslinks in the macroscopic gel freeze the compacted state . Further analysing the dynamics of the contraction grants insights to the ori - gin of the asymmetry . Observing the long side and the short side , the onset of contraction in y - direction takes place earlier than in x - direction ( Fig . 4 . 10a ) . Thereby , regions directly at the edge start moving ﬁrst . Later on , the short edges detach and both dimensions contract simultaneously . Hypothetically , the earlier contraction of the short dimension globally increases the elastic modulus . Thus the later contraction of the long dimension does not reach the same contraction ratio , as it works against a higher counter force . To understand the different 49 Chapter 4 Contractile actin - myosin gels a b c y x t x y Time ( min ) C o n t r ac t . r a t e ( 1 / h ) 0 0 . 3 0 . 6 0 . 9 1 . 2 5 10 15 20 0 100200 t d ( µm ) Figure 4 . 10 : Contraction dynamics in a rectangular geometry .

( b ) The contraction rate increases over time in regions more distant to the boundary ( d ) until an isotropic contraction is reached , as shown in Schuppler et al . ( 2016 ) . onset times , one can imagine the force balances in the middle and at the edge of the gel . While the forces in the middle are isotropic and do not lead to a net movement , the forces on the edge are not balanced and can effectively contract the gel . As the gel becomes tensed over time , the motors can exert their forces in larger regions . Considering the overlap of these regions as a percolation pro - cess , the contraction of the short side precedes the one of the long side . The observations agree with the ﬁndings in the microscopic setup , where the con - traction speed increases with time in regions distant to the boundary ( Schuppler et al . , 2016 ) ( Fig . 4 . 10b ) . In conclusion , aspect ratio geometries fundamentally affect active gel contrac - tions . Thereby , the boundary plays a central role by breaking the symmetry of the local force balances . This provides a generic mechanism for the build - up of structures as a consequence of their initial shape . Many in vivo processes have been shown to react on geometry , both on the single cell ( Oakes et al . , 2014 ) and the cell ensemble level ( Fernandez & Bausch , 2009 ) . A comparison with these phenomena will help separating cellular regulation from intrinsic gel properties . 4 . 2 . 2 Internal adhesion sites Asymmetric boundary conditions can be deﬁned by controlling adhesions . If one imagines a channel that provides anchor points only at its ends , the gel inside will certainly contract to span a ﬁbre . A similar , but more complex scen - ario is found in cells , where stress ﬁbres assemble between focal adhesions ( Naumanen et al . , 2008 ) , and in vitro systems mimic the assembly ( Ciobanasu et al . , 2012 ) . While these examples study point - like adhesions , here the effect of objects embedded in the contractile gel is demonstrated . An arbitrary geometry of large adhesive sites is provided by mixing Ni - NTA agarose beads ( r ≈ 10 – 100 µ m ) into the gel , where anillin can bind via His - tag . 50 4 . 3 Conclusion a b c Figure 4 . 11 : Marcroscopic internal adhesion sites reorganise contractile gels . Ni - NTA agarose beads are embedded into active gels , binding to the His - tag of anillin . ( a ) In weakly connected gels , actin accumulates on the beads c a = 5 µ M , c ani = 56 nM , c myo = 6 . 3 nM ) . ( b ) At intermediate levels , a cortex forms around the surface , pulling on the environment c a = 5 µ M , c ani = 167 nM , c myo = 6 . 3 nM ) . ( c ) For higher concentrations , a network of ﬁbres spanning in between the beads is formed ( c a = 5 µ M , c ani = 500 nM , c myo = 25 nM ) . Bars are 100 µ m . The reaction of the gel depends on the crosslink concentration and results in distinct structure formation . In a loosely connected active solution ( c ani = 56 nM ) , actin accumulates over time at the bead surfaces ( Fig . 4 . 11a ) . On an inter - mediate anillin level ( c ani = 167 nM ) , the beads attract a dense cortex , that pulls on the network environment ( Fig . 4 . 11b ) . Remarkably , this gel conﬁguration showed a global contraction in spherical setups . At high crosslink concentration ( c ani = 500 nM ) , the gel fully contracts , spanning a network of ﬁbres in between the beads ( Fig . 4 . 11c ) . In a similar setup , the effect of an ensemble of small internalised objects is tested ( r ≈ 1 µ m , silica beads ) . Without any additional beads , the gel contracts locally to well - seperated clusters ( c a = 5 µ M , c ani = 125 nM , c myo = 100 nM ) . After the addition of beads , the clusters merge and form a network of clusters connected by ﬁbres . Further increasing the bead concentration leads to a global contraction to one single cluster ( Fig . 4 . 12 ) . In summary , the results exemplarily demonstrate how adhesive objects within the gel alter its contraction . Different structures are formed , depending on the gel composition and on the distance in between the objects . Presumably , ad - hesive objects can create stable connections , that link contractile clusters and thereby lower the percolation threshold . 4 . 3 Conclusion Geometry and adhesion of the boundaries steers contraction dynamics and structure formation . In the absence of adhesion , already low concentrations of myosin motors are able to contract the entire gel to a very dense state , pre - sumably until sterical limitations come into play . Thereby , the contraction speed is slowed down by network elasticity and is crucially sped up by the myosin concentration . 51 Chapter 4 Contractile actin - myosin gels w / o 1x 100x Figure 4 . 12 : Internalised objects induce gel percolation . The addition of different amounts of silica beads ( r ≈ d ( r ≈ 1 µ m ) to a locally contractile gel ( left , no beads ) leads to the formation of larger clusters ( middle , 1x beads ) . Higher bead densities ( right , 100x beads ) induce a global contraction . Lower images depict four - fold magniﬁed details of the top row . Bars are 400 µ m ( top ) and 100 µ m ( bottom ) . Asymmetric geometries cause the short axis of the gels to contract earlier and stronger than the long axis . Thereby , the boundaries cause unbalanced forces that propagate into the gel , increasing the fraction of motors taking part in directed contraction over time . While pure actomyosin gels return to their initial aspect ratio , crosslinked systems keep a higher aspect ratio that they reach during contraction . Adhesion counteracts the contractile motor forces and thus is able to organise structures . The adhesion strength determines if a cortical layer or a volume spanning tensed network is formed . Under contractile stress , the gel either detaches from the surface in case of low adhesion , or ruptures if a strong cortical layer is formed . Importantly the force balance depends on the surface to volume ratio , as the adhesion has to counteract myosin forces that are created in the bulk . Adhesive surfaces do not only recruit a cortex - like structure , but also guide the gel to span ﬁbres in between them . In state - of - the - art in vitro sytems , both polymerisation and contraction start with the mixing of the gels . By this , reproducibility of experiments and com - parability between studies is impeded , as polymerisation speed deviates for dif - ferent buffer conditions and actin preparations ( Falzone et al . , 2012 ) . Further - more , the composition of the contracting part becomes unknown , as indicated by the surrounding residual gel . To overcome this problem , more well - deﬁned setups should initialise contraction after polymerisation is ﬁnished , e . g . by light - activation of myosin ( Nakamura et al . , 2014 ; Schuppler et al . , 2016 ) . Future systems will also include actin turnover , creating a dynamic equilibrium between polymerisation and degradation as it is found in cells Abu Shah & Keren ( 2014 ) . By this , more sophisticated cell - mimic systems will shed light on cytoskeletal actin organisation . 52 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels The actin cytoskeleton serves cells not only for mechanical stability , but also to actively generate forces ( Janmey & McCulloch , 2007 ) . While myosin motors are employed to generate contractions ( Backouche et al . , 2006 ) , many essential processes require protrusive forces as well . Therefore cells make use of poly - merising actin gels ( Kovar & Pollard , 2004 ) , where the addition of monomers to the ﬁlament tips serves as a ratchet - like mechanism to build up pressure against obstacles ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ; Mogilner & Oster , 1996a ) . This principle is ubiquitously found in cellular motion like the protrusion of lamellipodia dur - ing migration ( Svitkina & Borisy , 1999 ) , ﬁlopodia formation ( Hug et al . , 1995 ) , phago - and pinocytotic cups ( May et al . , 2000 ) , endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) , autophagy ( Coutts & La Thangue , 2016 ) , as well as in the propulsion of various pathogens ( Dabiri et al . , 1990 ; Stevens et al . , 2006 ) . However , an unordered polymerisation process only generates isotropic forces and hence is not sufﬁcient to exert forces in a deﬁned manner . Therefore the actin is organised into highly specialised structures ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ; Skau & Waterman , 2015 ) and their required net directionality is commonly in - duced by speciﬁc actin nucleation promoting factors ( NPF ) that are localised at the plasma membrane ( ( Machesky et al . , 1997 ; Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . In addi - tion to that , the structures rely on deﬁned ﬁlament lengths that are controlled by proteins capping the ﬁlament tips . A prominent example of protrusive structures are dendritic networks formed by Arp2 / 3 and Capping Protein ( CP ) , where Arp2 / 3 nucleates new branches on ﬁlaments and CP limits their growth ( Fig . 5 . 1a ) ( Welch et al . , 1997 ; Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . This interplay regulates both network architecture and force exer - tion which was demonstrated in a wide range of in vitro and in vivo experiments ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . While the lamellipodium is just a thin layer pushing the membrane forward ( Small , 1995 ; Lammermann & Sixt , 2009 ) , listeria are pro - pelled by a comet - like actin column at their rear ( Dabiri et al . , 1990 ) and en - docytotic structures create complex force patterns in a cylindrical patch , pulling the membrane inward ( Martin et al . , 2006 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Many insights have been gained reconstructing listeria - like motility in vitro ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Wiesner et al . , 2003 ) , where shorter ﬁlaments form more protrusive structures ( Achard et al . , 2010 ) . In further in vitro studies on beads , the importance of the interplay of CP and Arp2 / 3 was shown , as CP also promotes the nucleation rate 53 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels Membrane actin monomer a b Arp2 / 3 CP VCA Plusend actin ﬁlament + - + - VCA VCAG Arp2 / 3 Arp * CP G - actin F - actin Plusends + - + + Activation Regulation Polymerisation Figure 5 . 1 : Schematic of binding kinetics and structure generation . ( a ) Key protein interactions . Actin ﬁlaments polymerise at their plus ends until CP stops their elonga - tion . Arp2 / 3 nucleates sidewards branches on ﬁlaments after its activation by VCA at the membrane . ( b ) Dendritic network growth is composed of three sub - processes : ac - tivation , regulation and polymerisation . Polymerisation takes place at the ﬁlament plus ends , which are regulated by Arp2 / 3 and CP . Before binding , the nucleator Arp2 / 3 is activated by VCA at the membrane , thereby creating directionality . Filled arrows denote complex formation . Light arrows with + / - signs denote up and down regulation . and thereby sets distinct regimes of stalling and motility , shifting the force distri - bution ( Akin & Mullins , 2008 ) . To that end , forces have been characterised for single ﬁlaments ( Footer et al . , 2007 ) and ensembles like in lamellipodia ( Prass et al . , 2006 ) , conﬁrming the ratchet - like mechanism and identifying regimes of maximal power transduction and stalling ( Demoulin et al . , 2014 ) . However , the force feedback on network organisation , observed in vivo ( Vignjevic & Montag - nac , 2008 ) and in vitro ( Parekh et al . , 2005 ; Bieling et al . , 2016 ) remains elusive . In all these systems , the activation of Arp2 / 3 by Ena / VASP ( Laurent et al . , 1999 ) or WASP ( Yarar et al . , 1999 ) plays a key role in structure formation ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) . The distribution of these proteins was shown to direct force ex - ertion in lamellipodia ( Bear et al . , 2002 ) or endocytosis ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2004 ) and they are the interface for cellular regulatory mechanisms to access dendritic networks ( Higgs & Pollard , 2001 ; Millard et al . , 2004 ) . Theoretical studies soon captured the basic behaviour of lamellipodia ( Mogil - ner & Oster , 1996b ) , networks pushing against obstacles ( Carlsson , 2001 ) and motile cells like listeria ( Gerbal et al . , 2000 ) or keratocytes ( Grimm et al . , 2003 ) . Nowadays in silico work is capable to describe highly complex systems like motile cells ( Kabaso et al . , 2011 ) , endocytotic cups ( Carlsson & Bayly , 2014 ) , synergistic effects with co - proteins ( Maree et al . , 2006 ; Tania et al . , 2013 ) , as well as directionality effects of the network ( Weichsel & Schwarz , 2010 ) . While proceeding towards modelling high complexity , the nucleation rate was com - monly assumed to be constant ( Keren et al . , 2008 ) and rather than implementing the activation process , artiﬁcial saturations for branching were introduced ( La - cayo et al . , 2007 ) . This returned partly contradictory results of either autocata - lytic or constant branching , which could be resolved by modelling the activation , however leaving out the detailed binding kinetics ( Weichsel et al . , 2013 ) . 54 5 . 1 Dendritic network assembly Here , following the early studies , a simplistic kinetic model of the key proteins actin , Arp2 / 3 and CP is implemented , now including the dynamics of the ac - tivation system . Basic steady - state network properties are derived analytically , identifying threshold conditions for continuous growth . Furthermore , the effects on structure formation in the temporal evolution from an out - of - equilibrium initial state is investigated . There , also coupled depletion of limited protein reservoirs is shown to create gradient structures . Extending the model to a spatial di - mension , a possible CP dependent mechanism to generate distinct patterns of protrusive force exertion is identiﬁed . Subsequently the transition from an ini - tially ﬂat to a three dimensional growing network is discussed , emphasising that ﬁlaments in ﬂat angle to the membrane offer more interaction sites for branch - ing . From this a mechanical force feedback model for dendritic network growth is derived , explaining phenomena observed in current literature . 5 . 1 Dendritic network assembly Dendritic networks gain their properties through their assembly process ( Carls - son , 2010 ) . While in bulk network formation the constituents bind into an iso - tropic equilibrium structure ( Kushner , 1969 ) , the restriction of growth to the nucleator presenting surface creates directionality and offers the opportunity to organise the assembly ( Nicolis & PRIGOGINE , 1977 ; Fritzsche et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore the antagonistic proteins Arp2 / 3 and CP regulate the number of poly - merisation sites ( the plus ends ) up and down ( Iwasa & Mullins , 2007 ) ( Fig . 5 . 1 ) . Notably there is a positive feedback from the number of plus ends to its up - regulation by Arp2 / 3 while capping is a linear process . Thus a full control of growth requires another effect that limits branching . A physical reason for a sat - uration of branching is identiﬁed in the activation step of Arp2 / 3 ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . Including this step into the model allows to derive the network properties from the kinetic equations of protein binding . 5 . 1 . 1 Kinetic equations The growth of dendritic networks is organised as follows . First Arp2 / 3 is ac - tivated at the membrane by building a complex with VCA ( Marchand et al . , 2001 ) . Thereupon it binds to the side of an existing actin ﬁlament , which is called " mother ﬁlament " and nucleates a " daughter ﬁlament " in an angle of 70 ° ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Amann & Pollard , 2001 ) . This process generates direc - tionality , because the plus ends predominantly point towards the membrane ( Maree et al . , 2006 ) . Subsequent actin polymerisation elongates the ﬁlaments and only subunits that remain in vicinity of the membrane are accessible for fur - ther branching . Finally the binding of CP to the plus ends stops the growth of ﬁlaments and thereby controls their length ( Cooper & Schafer , 2000 ) . By itera - tion of the processes a branched polymer network is formed and its properties are controlled by the frequencies of branching and capping . Consequently the 55 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels chemical composition of the network is set by the kinetic equations of protein binding : Nucleation : G + G − (cid:42)(cid:41) − G 2 ; G 2 + G − (cid:42)(cid:41) − G 3 : = F 3 ; ( 5 . 1 ) Polymerisation : F n + G k on −− (cid:42)(cid:41) −− k oﬀ F n + 1 ; ( 5 . 2 ) Arp2 / 3 - Activation : VCA + G k 1 − (cid:42)(cid:41) − k 2 VCAG ; VCAG + Arp2 / 3 k 3 − (cid:42)(cid:41) − k 4 Arp ∗ ; ( 5 . 3 ) Branching : Arp ∗ + F n k Arp −− (cid:42) F n + F 1 + VCA ; ( 5 . 4 ) Capping : CP + F n k CP −− (cid:42) CPF n ; ( 5 . 5 ) With the notation : G / G 2 / G 3 actin monomer / dimer / trimer F n actin ﬁlament of n subunits VCA Arp2 / 3 - activating region of WASP family proteins VCAG complex of VCA with an actin monomer ( activated VCA ) Arp ∗ complex of Arp2 / 3 with VCAG ( activated Arp2 / 3 ) CP , CPF n Capping Protein , capped actin ﬁlament k oﬀ , k on De - / polymerisation rate k 1 , k 3 Activator system forward rates k 2 , k 4 Activator system reverse rates k Arp interaction constant of activated Arp2 / 3 with a ﬁlament k CP capping rate 5 . 1 . 2 Network properties As alluded before the interplay of actin polymerisation with the antagonists CP and Arp2 / 3 and VCA - activation offers a manifold of possibilities to modulate the behaviour of the gel . Thereby the network structure is a key feature and know - ledge about polymerisation speed and actin density is not sufﬁcient to character - ise the properties of the gel . For example the same actin density can be formed by different micro - structures , given by ﬁlament length and number of daughter branches ( Fig . 5 . 2a ) . The detailed composition affects elastic properties ( Pujol et al . , 2012 ; Bieling et al . , 2016 ) and presumably also intracellular transport ( Ali et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , growth velocity and force exertion are affected ( Prass et al . , 2006 ; Dmitrieff & Nedelec , 2016 ) , especially when interacting with a mem - brane ( Keren , 2011 ) ( Fig . 5 . 2b ) . In turn forces also lead to internal stresses that can be stored and released afterwards ( Zhu & Mogilner , 2012 ) ( Fig . 5 . 2c ) . The simulation aims for providing a minimal model to follow the question how the constituents modify the properties of the network . To this end the kinetic equations 5 . 1 - 5 . 5 are transcribed into a system of dif - ferential equations . Together with the initial concentrations of the proteins and the boundary conditions , a continuum description of network growth is possible : 56 5 . 1 Dendritic network assembly Arp * CP G - actin ﬁlamentlength Plusends elongationspeed monomeruptake forcetotal protrusionspeed Load force angle F - actin density forceﬁlament Arp2 / 3 VCA branchcount b r a n c h c o un t 1 2 ﬁlament length 1 2 v 0 v net F ﬁl F tot F m v m v net v m a c e b d passive active Polymeri - sation Activation Regulation Feedback Membrane Filament v v Figure 5 . 2 : Schematics of dendritic network properties . ( a ) Filament length and number of daughter branches per mother branch determine the network structure . Not only density is affected , but notably an average branch number unequal to one leads to increasing or decreasing density . ( b ) The ﬁlaments elongate at velocity v 0 and the network growth speed v net is a projection normal to the activation surface . This addition of monomers creates a force F ﬁl or for the ensemble F tot pushing forward that is coun - teracted by membrane tension F m . ( c ) Thus the protrusion velocity v m is lower than v net presumably creating internal stresses . Thereby the network gets densiﬁed , effectively increasing the ﬁlament angle . ( d ) In absence of restructuring processes the rear net - work is a passive structure and all activity takes place in the front region at the activator surface . ( e ) The properties of a growing dendritic network can be derived from its key constituents G - actin , CP , Arp2 / 3 , VCA and the load force , e . g . given by a membrane tension . The arrows show the dependencies implemented in the model . 57 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels The addition of all species of proteins is calculated at any time , returning the expectational values for the ensemble . Because the model does not include any processes acting on ﬁlaments distant from the membrane , the network is considered to be passive with an active region at the front . As a consequence the time dimension of the formation process directly translates into the spatial dimension of the passive part ( Fig . 5 . 2d ) . Starting from that , it is sufﬁcient to know about the key players G - actin , CP , Arp2 / 3 , VCA area density and membrane tension to ﬁnd both the resulting struc - ture and dynamics ( Fig . 5 . 2e ) . Serendipitously some quantities do not depend on all the key players and there are only few feedback loops , enabling to form simple equations . For example the ﬁlament length (cid:104) l (cid:105) is only a result of the competition of actin and CP binding : (cid:104) l (cid:105) = ˙ G ˙ C = k on G − k oﬀ k CP C . ( 5 . 6 ) Together with the distance between branches (cid:104) l Arp (cid:105) - which is derived from the activator dependent nucleation rate k nuc and the number of plus ends N B - the number of daughter branches calculates to be (cid:104) n (cid:105) = (cid:104) l Arp (cid:105) (cid:104) l (cid:105) = ˙ G ( k nuc N B ) − 1 ˙ G ˙ C − 1 = k CP C k nuc N B . ( 5 . 7 ) A steady - state growth is characterised by (cid:104) n (cid:105) = 1 , while values of (cid:104) n (cid:105) > 1 tell that the network densiﬁes , and accordingly at (cid:104) n (cid:105) < 1 the density decreases ( Fig . 5 . 2a ) . Similarly the elongation speed of load - free ﬁlaments purely depends on the actual G - actin concentration ( Fig . 5 . 2b ) , v 0 = k on G − k oﬀ , ( 5 . 8 ) and the force exerted by the ﬁlament F ﬁl can be directly derived if the angle to the surface is known ( Mogilner & Oster , 1996b ) . In the presence of a counterforce , the protrusion speed is weighted by a Boltzmann factor v = (cid:18) k on G exp (cid:18) − F ﬁl d k B T (cid:19) − k oﬀ (cid:19) , ( 5 . 9 ) where the exponent is the work done against the load by the insertion of one monomer , creating a normal displacement of d ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) . For an ensemble of pushers , each ﬁlament bears an equal share of the total load : F ﬁl = F tot / N B ( Mogilner et al . , 2001 ) ( van Doorn et al . , 2000 ) , and thus the membrane moves with the speed v m = d (cid:18) k on G exp (cid:18) − F tot d N B k B T (cid:19) − k oﬀ (cid:19) . ( 5 . 10 ) Notably , the ﬁlaments then elongate faster than the membrane protrudes and this mismatch leads to a more dense growth ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . This sug - gests the average angle of the ﬁlaments against the membrane becomes more 58 5 . 2 Steady state analysis shallow ( Fig . 5 . 2c ) , which has been shown to be important for the force exer - tion ( Dmitrieff & Nedelec , 2016 ) ( Weichsel & Schwarz , 2010 ) , but is also sugges - ted to come into play for Arp2 / 3 binding ( Carlsson , 2001 ) . However a detailed description of the behaviour under load is still lacking . Therefore the main part of this study investigates dendritic assembly neglecting the load force and a feedback model is presented in section 5 . 5 . 5 . 2 Steady state analysis For any given network composition and protein pool constitution , the kinetic equations describe deterministically the evolution of the system . Notably , as they are a set of coupled rate equations , it is in their nature to drive towards a steady state . Two different cases emerge . The ﬁrst is an equilibrium of on and off - reactions : there is no more net change in the system anymore and all deriv - atives equal zero . Whereas the second case are steady dynamics : the system grows uniformly and all derivatives are constant . In the following , a system of differential equations is formulated that models the kinetic equations 5 . 1 - 5 . 5 . Its steady - state solutions are calculated analyt - ically and their dependencies on the protein concentrations are subsequently discussed . 5 . 2 . 1 VCA - Arp2 / 3 activator equilibrium As pointed out before an important sub - process for localisation of the dendritic network growth is the activation of Arp2 / 3 . Only after complexation with VCA , which is localised at the membrane , Arp2 / 3 is able to bind sidewards on an existing actin ﬁlament ( Amann & Pollard , 2001 ) . Before that , VCA ( V ) has to form a complex with an actin monomer ( VCAG , V ∗ ) ( Kelly et al . , 2006 ) . Thus the relevant concentration of activator for ﬁlament branching is the one of Arp2 / 3 bound to VCAG , in the following called activated Arp2 / 3 ( A ∗ ) . This activation process is described by the equations 5 . 11 - 5 . 14 : d V d t = − k 1 G 0 V + k 2 V ∗ , ( 5 . 11 ) d V ∗ d t = + k 1 G 0 V − k 2 V ∗ − k 3 A 0 V ∗ + k 4 A ∗ , ( 5 . 12 ) d A ∗ d t = + k 3 A 0 V ∗ − k 4 A ∗ , ( 5 . 13 ) V 0 = V + V ∗ + A ∗ , ( 5 . 14 ) where V 0 , V , V ∗ and A ∗ are the area densities of total VCA , unbound VCA , VCA - actin complex and activated Arp2 / 3 ; G 0 , and A 0 are the pool concentrations of G - actin and Arp2 / 3 and k i are the binding rates . Equation 5 . 14 is redundant and only sets valid initial conditions of the system . 59 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels a b c d e f 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 inf 3 . 0 1 . 5 0 . 75 0 . 38 0 . 19 G 0 ( µM ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 inf 3 . 0 1 . 5 0 . 75 0 . 38 0 . 19 G 0 ( µM ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 inf 10 3 . 2 1 0 . 32 0 . 1 G 0 ( µM ) A 0 ( µM ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 G 0 ( µM ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 1 . 0 A 0 ( µM ) A 0 ( µM ) A * / V 0 G 0 ( µM ) G 0 ( µM ) inf 10 3 . 2 1 0 . 32 0 . 1 A 0 ( µM ) A 0 ( µ M ) A 0 ( µ M ) A * / V 0 A * / V 0 A * / V 0 A * / V 0 A * / V 0 Figure 5 . 3 : VCA - Arp2 / 3 activation system . Fraction of VCA presenting an activated Arp2 / 3 for branching . ( a ) The activator density A ∗ saturates in A 0 and G 0 . ( b ) Close - up of the low concentration regime of ( a ) . At low actin concentrations , the dependencies are strong in both A 0 and G 0 . ( c ) Saturation behaviour in A 0 at different G 0 ( colour ) . ( d ) Close - up of ( c ) in the low - Arp2 / 3 regime . ( e ) Saturation behaviour in G 0 at different A 0 ( colour ) . ( f ) Close - up of ( e ) in the low - actin regime . From these equations the equilibrium concentrations ( d c d t : = 0 ) of the activator system in absence of F - actin can be derived analytically as functions of G 0 , A 0 and V 0 : V eq = k 2 k 4 κ V 0 , ( 5 . 15 ) V ∗ eq = k 1 G 0 k 4 κ V 0 , ( 5 . 16 ) A ∗ eq = k 1 G 0 k 3 A 0 κ V 0 , ( 5 . 17 ) κ = k 1 G 0 k 3 A 0 + k 1 G 0 k 4 + k 2 k 4 . ( 5 . 18 ) The equations 5 . 15 - 5 . 17 all show a similar structure : each state is deﬁned by a product of transition rates and the common denominator κ is the sum of these 60 5 . 2 Steady state analysis terms . For the ground state V eq it is the product of the two reverse rates k 2 and k 4 . While for the excited state A ∗ eq it is the product of the two forward rates k 1 G 0 and k 3 A 0 . Finally , for the intermediate V ∗ eq the factors describe forward reaction from the ground state ( k 1 G 0 ) and reverse reaction from the excited state ( k 4 ) . Naturally , all concentrations ( 5 . 15 - 5 . 17 ) depend linearly on the total amount of VCA ( V 0 ) . In particular the activated Arp2 / 3 shows saturating behaviour in both Arp2 / 3 and actin concentration , going asymptotically towards V 0 ( Fig . 5 . 3a ) . Thereby , the saturation in G 0 already takes place at low levels of about 3 µ M . Hence this low actin regime should be considered separately ( Fig . 5 . 3b ) , whereas for higher actin concentrations A ∗ can be approximated by lim G 0 →∞ A ∗ = k 3 A 0 k 3 A 0 + k 4 V 0 . ( 5 . 19 ) In the high actin regime the saturation constant - denoting the half - maximum value - is given by K ∞ m = k 4 / k 3 = 0 . 75 µ M , comparable to literature values K m = 2 µ M ( Maree et al . , 2006 ; Tania et al . , 2013 ) that are related to exper - imental results from ( Higgs & Pollard , 1999 ) . Noteworthy in the low actin re - gime the saturation occurs much slower ( Fig . 5 . 3c and d ) , at K m = k 4 / k 3 + k 2 k 4 / ( k 3 k 1 G 0 ) . Relating these results to living cells , the high actin regime can be assumed in the lamellipodium , as concentrations there are known to be high ( ≈ 150 µ M ) ( Koestler et al . , 2009 ) . Fluctuations of the actin concentration , e . g . by local con - sumption , should not feedback on the rate of branch creation . On the contrary in the regime of low actin , as it can be found in HeLa cells ( Fritzsche et al . , 2016 ) , A ∗ shows strong gradients in both actin and Arp2 / 3 . Consequently depletion effects are likely to come into play as the actin monomers have to be distrib - uted among the consumers ( Mogilner & Edelstein - Keshet , 2002 ) . For example , if a high number of plus ends incorporates a high amount of actin , the activator density will decrease and less daughter branches are formed in the following , reducing the actin consumption . 5 . 2 . 2 Steady polymerisation dynamics Under the condition of constant protein pools ( V 0 , G 0 , A 0 , C 0 ) , the kinetic equa - tions lead to steady growth dynamics . That means after an equilibration phase all net particle on - rates stay constant resulting in a network of ﬁxed structure that is growing continuously from the activator surface . This behaviour is experi - mentally observed on actin columns at patterned surfaces ( Galland et al . , 2013 ; Bieling et al . , 2016 ) , the growth of actin shells around beads ( Akin & Mullins , 2008 ) , in listeria propulsion or in bead motility assays ( Plastino et al . , 2004b ) . The key variable in the polymerisation process is the density of plus ends B , since it is proportional to the number of ﬁlaments and the actin monomer uptake . Both Arp2 / 3 and CP can be seen as regulators of this growth , enhancing or decreasing the number of plus ends ( Fig . 5 . 1 ) . As the network is considered to grow against the activated surface , the branching rate is proportional to the number of ﬁlaments in proximity to the membrane and thus to B . This generates 61 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels a self - ampliﬁcation for B , that is counteracted by the termination of ﬁlament growth by CP . d B d t = + k Arp A ∗ B − k CP C 0 B , ( 5 . 20 ) where k Arp is the interaction constant of activated Arp2 / 3 with a ﬁlament and C 0 is the concentration of CP with its binding constant to barbed ends k CP . Subsequently the equations 5 . 11 and 5 . 13 have to be extended by the terms describing the binding of the activated Arp2 / 3 - VCAG complex to the ﬁlaments ( Eq . 5 . 21 ) and the release of the VCA after branch formation ( Eq . 5 . 22 ) . d A ∗ d t = + k 3 A 0 V ∗ − k 4 A ∗ − k Arp A ∗ B , ( 5 . 21 ) d V d t = − k 1 G 0 V + k 2 V ∗ + k Arp A ∗ B , ( 5 . 22 ) In steady state ( ss ) , the number of plus ends newly created by branching equals the number of plus ends annihilated by capping : k Arp A ∗ ss B ss = k CP C 0 B ss , k Arp A ∗ ss = k CP C 0 . ( 5 . 23 ) Under use of this condition , the steady state concentrations can be derived ana - lytically : A ∗ ss = k CP C 0 k Arp , ( 5 . 24 ) V ss = (cid:18) ( k 2 + k 3 A 0 ) V 0 − k CP C 0 k Arp ( k 2 + k 3 A 0 + k 4 ) (cid:19) τ , ( 5 . 25 ) V ∗ ss = (cid:18) k 1 G 0 V 0 − k CP C 0 k Arp ( k 1 G 0 − k 4 ) (cid:19) τ , ( 5 . 26 ) B ss = (cid:18) 1 k CP C 0 k 1 G 0 k 3 A 0 V 0 − 1 k Arp κ (cid:19) τ , ( 5 . 27 ) τ = 1 k 1 G 0 + k 2 + k 3 A 0 , ( 5 . 28 ) where τ is a characteristic time of the reactions and κ is the squared time con - stant from the activator system ( Eq . 5 . 18 ) . Exemplary values at G 0 = 3 µ M and A 0 = 0 . 1 µ M are τ ≈ 6 ms and κ ≈ 90 s − 2 . Although the number of plus ends depends on all concentrations , the density of activated Arp2 / 3 at the surface ( A ∗ ss ) is only a function of CP ( Eq . 5 . 24 ) ( Fig . 5 . 4a ) . This may appear contradictory at a ﬁrst view , however it is a consequence of the condition for steady growth ( Eq . 5 . 23 ) . In fact A ∗ ss is just a transient state and though its density is ﬁxed , the throughput increases with V 0 , G 0 and A 0 . The resulting plus end density has two contributions ( Eq . 5 . 28 ) . The ﬁrst positive term expresses the maximum plus end density possible for a hypothet - ical inﬁnite branch rate k Arp . Whereas the second negative term describes the amount of Arp2 / 3 that is not accessible for branching due to the kinetics of the activation system . Thereby the two parts show some similarity : both terms show 62 5 . 2 Steady state analysis c d a 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 00 0 . 15 0 . 30 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 C 0 ( µ M ) A 0 ( µM ) 0 . 00 0 . 15 0 . 30 C 0 ( µ M ) G 0 ( µM ) 20 60 100 A * ( / µm 2 ) C 0 ( µ M ) C 0 ( µ M ) A 0 ( µM ) G 0 ( µM ) B ( / µm 2 ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 20 60 100 A * ( / µm 2 ) 0 B ( / µm 2 ) 100 200 300 400 500 b Figure 5 . 4 : Steady polymerisation dynamics . ( a ) - ( b ) The steady - state density of activated Arp2 / 3 depends only on CP and notably is independent of VCA , Arp2 / 3 or actin . ( c ) The barbed end density B and thus the network density ( at zero force ) is controlled by the concentrations of Arp2 / 3 and CP . ( d ) The barbed end density saturates rapidly with increasing actin G 0 . Negative B ( black regions ) indicate for conditions that do not support continuous network growth , discussed in section 5 . 2 . 3 a numerator that describes a production reaction , while their denominators are the counteracting rates of capping or branching . Remarkably , only the positive contribution depends on the total VCA density at the surface . As a consequence of the subtraction , negative values may emerge . They describe conditions that do not allow steady growth dynamics , which are discussed further in section 5 . 2 . 3 . Analogous to the activation system , the dependency on actin saturates already at low concentrations ( G 0 ≈ 3 µ M ) , and limits the activation step ( Fig . 5 . 4c ) : lim G 0 →∞ B ss = (cid:18) 1 k CP C 0 V 0 − 1 k Arp (cid:19) k 3 A 0 − k 4 k Arp . ( 5 . 29 ) For V 0 (cid:29) k − 1Arp this further simpliﬁes to : lim G 0 →∞ B ss = k 3 A 0 k CP C 0 V 0 . ( 5 . 30 ) This reciprocal relation between Arp2 / 3 and CP is the central point of the regulation of ﬁlament density . Equally scaling the concentrations of the two regulators keeps the plus end density constant ( Fig . 5 . 4d ) . Interestingly , the branch constant k Arp could be determined experimentally , making use of equation 5 . 29 . For the threshold CP concentration that is required 63 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels to suppress steady network growth in dependence of Arp2 / 3 , k Arp calculates by k Arp = k CP C 0 V 0 (cid:18) 1 + k 4 k 3 A 0 (cid:19) . ( 5 . 31 ) Estimations based on literature , where steady growth is still observed at A 0 = 20 nM , C 0 = 112 nM and V 0 < 1 × 10 5 / µ m 2 ( Akin & Mullins , 2008 ) , return 500 nm 2 s − 1 as a lower limit for k Arp . 5 . 2 . 3 Critical concentrations Regulation of dendritic actin networks does not only mean to adjust their prop - erties , but also includes controlled switching between states of steady growth and paused activity . This transition can be achieved by tuning the activity of the involved proteins ( Edwards et al . , 2014 ) . If less plus ends are nucleated than capped at any time , the plus end density will decrease until no polymerisation sites are left . Obviously this can originate from high CP concentrations . But in fact for every set of concentrations ( V 0 , G 0 , A 0 , C 0 ) once three of them are ﬁxed , the fourth one shows a lower limit below which there is no steady network growth ( Fig . 5 . 5a ) . The model predicts the concentration regime in which steady - state polymer - isation takes place . As a growing network requires open barbed ends in the steady state , the borders of the regime - the critical concentrations - are given by the condition B ss = 0 . Using this , the upper limit C crit0 for the CP concentration in dependence of the Arp2 / 3 and VCA concentrations is derived to be : C crit0 = k Arp k CP k 1 G 0 k 3 A 0 κ V 0 = k Arp k CP A ∗ eq , ( 5 . 32 ) Again it turns out that the actin concentration only comes into play if it is very low ( G 0 ≈ 3 µ M ) ( Fig . 5 . 5b ) . Hence for the high actin regime C crit0 simpliﬁes to : lim G 0 →∞ C crit0 = k Arp k CP k 3 A 0 k 3 A 0 + k 4 V 0 . ( 5 . 33 ) Similarly , if the concentration of CP is kept constant , the critical density of VCA is found : V crit0 = k CP C 0 k Arp κ k 1 G 0 k 3 A 0 , ( 5 . 34 ) with the high actin limit : lim G 0 →∞ V crit0 = k CP C 0 k Arp k 3 A 0 + k 4 k 3 A 0 . ( 5 . 35 ) The critical concentrations offer a unique opportunity for regulation of dend - ritic networks . If only one protein species is below its threshold , steady network growth is suppressed . If the threshold is exceeded , an avalanche of branching is unleashed due to the multiplicative effect of branch formation . In particu - lar , cells can achieve this switching not only by varying the concentrations , but 64 5 . 3 Time evolution c d a b 0 . 00 0 . 10 0 . 20 0 . 30 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 5001000150020002500 0 . 00 0 . 10 0 . 20 0 . 30 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 2004006008001000 C 0 ( µ M ) A 0 ( µM ) G 0 ( µM ) A 0 ( µM ) C 0 ( µ M ) G 0 ( µ M ) C 0 ( µM ) crit V 0 ( / µm 2 ) crit V 0 ( / µm 2 ) crit A 0 ( µM ) V 0 ( / µ m 2 ) C 0 ( µM ) Figure 5 . 5 : Critical concentrations as a requisite for network growth .

( d ) Close - up on V crit0 in the low actin regime . also by chemical regulation of their proteins . In the case of CP , its dissipation constant increases in the presence of the phospholipid PIP 2 in the membrane , effectively lowering the concentration ( Schafer , D . A . , Jennings P . B . , Cooper J . A . , 1996 ) and additional regulators like V - 1 and CARMIL exist ( Fujiwara et al . , 2014 ; Jung et al . , 2016 ) . Recent studies have identiﬁed similar inihibitors for Arp2 / 3 as well , for example CK - 0944636 and CK - 0993548 ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) or WASH , WHAMM and JMY ( Rottner et al . , 2010 ) . Likewise in the case of VCA , phosphorylation enhances its afﬁnity to Arp2 / 3 ( Cory et al . , 2003 ) , resulting in a higher net concentration . Assemblies of functional structures could make use of the critical concentrations and initialise growth after localising the NPFs in low - activity state . 5 . 3 Time evolution The previous section 5 . 2 discussed the equilibrium states of the activator sys - tem and the steady state polymerisation of a network separately . However , the temporal development from the initial to the ﬁnal state is of interest , as this non - equilibrium process intrinsically generates gradients in network architecture and 65 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels force exertion . Furthermore , if the assumption of unlimited protein reservoirs is omitted , the growth process drives itself out of equilibrium . Here , these dynam - ics are analysed by numerical simulation of the model system . 5 . 3 . 1 Equilibration dynamics Merging the results of the steady state analysis reveals that more activator is offered at the membrane in absence of a network than during polymerisation ( Fig . 5 . 6a ) . This discrepancy drives the time evolution of the system towards steady state , as it generates an enhanced branching activity after initiation of growth . The resulting initial phase of exponential network growth is followed by either an increases or a decreases to the steady state level , depending on the CP concentration ( Fig . 5 . 6b ) . Conceptually the emerging dynamics can be understood as consecutive ele - mentary reactions . Therefore it is helpful to consider the branching and the capping reactions as two successive steps , introducing a total number of plus ends as an ancillary quantity . In steady - state ( ss ) , there are as many branches created as ﬁlaments capped ( Fig . 5 . 6c ) . However , in the initial state , the equi - librated activation system offers a high amount of nucleator A ∗ eq that exceeds A ∗ ss ( Fig . 5 . 6d ) . A given initial barbed end density B i rises exponentially , as the plus end production self - feedbacks . Thereby the excess in A ∗ propagates to the total plus ends ( bright region ) , of which CP subsequently caps a ﬁxed fraction . Thus CP temporarily cannot counteract the increase of the plus end density , and values higher than the steady - state level can occur . Later on the activator drops to its steady state level and two cases emerge . Eventually existing plus ends above the steady - state level ( B > B ss ) are not sustainable , as they would request A ∗ faster than it is regenerated . Whereas if there are still less plus ends than in steady state ( B < B ss ) , more branches are created at a constant rate and the cap - ping rate gradually increases ( Fig . 5 . 6b ) . Thus in both cases the concentrations are driven towards the steady state . The equilibration dynamics are inﬂuenced by CP at three stages ( Fig . 5 . 6e ) . First , the difference of A eq and A ss decreases with CP , providing less branches for out - of - equilibrium growth . Second , the slope of the exponential in the initial phase is reduced by CP . However the third effect on the steady - state level is the strongest and thus the plus end density either increases monotonically or exhibits an overshoot . By this , spatio - temporal gradients in network density and force generation are generated , that become especially interesting when a three dimensional growth process is considered , as discussed in section 5 . 4 . 2 . 5 . 3 . 2 Finite reservoir effects Cellular processes like lamellipodia formation take place on relatively short time - scales and incorporate extensive amounts of proteins from the cytosol ( Lammer - mann & Sixt , 2009 ) . This raises the question , how the depletion of protein pools affects their structure formation . Independently of the debate whether this plays 66 5 . 3 Time evolution a b * * A B ActivatedArp2 / 3 Total Plus ends Plusends branch cap A ss B ss Time - CP + CP - CP + CP steady - state initial phase P l u s e n d s B ss - CP + CP 0 . 00 0 . 10 0 . 20 0 . 30 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 - 245 - 175 - 105 - 35 35 105 175 245 A 0 ( µM ) C 0 ( µ M ) A e q - A ss ( / µ m 2 ) * * 0 100 200 300 400 0 100 200 300 A ( / µ m 2 ) * 0 2 4 6 8 0 200 400 600 Time ( s ) E v e n t s ( / µ m 2 / s ) B ( / µ m 2 ) * * A ss A eq 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 18 CP ( µM ) 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 18 CP ( µM ) 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 18 CP ( µM ) capping branching * * A ss B ss B i A eq c d dt e Figure 5 . 6 : Equilibration of polymerisation and activation .

( c ) Schematic represent - ation of the steady state , introducing the ancillary quantity of total plus ends . Notably there is a positive feedback within branching ( sketched by the exponential increase ) while capping goes linearly with the number of plus ends . ( d ) The excess in A ∗ in the initial state causes the barbed ends to rise faster than the counteracting capping process . ( e ) Thereby , B undergoes either a monotonous increase or an overshoot be - haviour , depending on the CP concentration that has more inﬂuence on the steady state level than on the initial slope . 67 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels a role in cells or not , certain cell - mimic systems like vesicles are certainly sub - ject of limited reservoirs and it is necessary to study these effects to understand their behaviour . The extension of the model requires not only that the formerly constant pool concentrations G 0 , C 0 and A 0 become time dependent , but also a scaling between active area and solution volume . Additionally , equations for the ac - tivator system at positions where no polymerisation takes place ( ¯ V , ¯ V ∗ , ¯ A ∗ ) have to be deﬁned analogues to Eqs . 5 . 15 - 5 . 17 . d G d t = ( ( − k on G + k oﬀ ) B − k 1 GV + k 2 V ∗ ) χ + (cid:0) − k 1 G ¯ V + k 2 ¯ V ∗ (cid:1) ¯ χ ( 5 . 36 ) d C d t = − k CP CBχ ( 5 . 37 ) d A d t = ( − k 3 AV ∗ + k 4 A ∗ ) χ + (cid:0) − k 3 A ¯ V ∗ + k 4 ¯ A ∗ (cid:1) ¯ χ ( 5 . 38 ) χ = 3 r 2 4 R 3 N Avo , ¯ χ = 3 ( 4 R 2 − r 2 ) 4 R 3 N Avo ( 5 . 39 ) Where G , C and A are the concentrations of actin , CP and Arp2 / 3 in solution . χ and ¯ χ are a conversion factors from particle count to molar values , for the active and the passive region respectively , with the Avogadro constant N Avo and the radii r and R of the circular area and the spherical volume respectively . For simplicity the area is assumed to be constant and the case of lateral growth is discussed in section 5 . 4 . 2 . The proteins pools deplete in a correlated manner ( Fig . 5 . 7a ) . Initially , both actin and Arp2 / 3 show a rapid drop since they have to saturate the activation system . In the further time evolution , the ratios between the protein concen - trations are no longer kept constant , signiﬁcantly affecting network architecture ( Fig . 5 . 7b ) . The emerging imbalances in CP and Arp2 / 3 change the average ﬁlament length (cid:104) d CP (cid:105) and the average spacing of branches (cid:104) d Arp (cid:105) . Thereby , if the number of branches per ﬁlament (cid:104) n (cid:105) = (cid:104) d CP (cid:105) / (cid:104) d Arp (cid:105) is smaller than 1 the network density decreases , while (cid:104) n (cid:105) > 1 leads to an increase . Addition - ally , the depletion of actin changes the elongation speed of the ﬁlaments . As a consequence , the actin network densiﬁes even if a constant branch rate is assumed . A global picture of these depletion effects becomes comprehensible when looking at the steady - state phase space ( Fig . 5 . 7c ) . At any given point in the G - C - plane , the derivatives of the concentrations are deterministically coupled . Thus , assuming a quasi equilibrium , the system evolves along certain trajector - ies of deﬁned network structure . Importantly , the characteristics of the coupling depend on the ratios of the binding constants . Substantially different network behaviour upon pool deple - tion is caused by changing k CP ( Fig . 5 . 7d - f ) . In the case of a high k CP of 12 / µ M / s , where the relative consumption of CP almost equals the one of actin , depletion predominantly leads to an increase of network density ( Fig . 5 . 7c ) . On the contrary , a lower k CP of 4 / µ M / s causes a decrease , as the fraction of CP in the solution becomes relatively higher . Interestingly , these particular values 68 5 . 3 Time evolution 0 50 100 150 200 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 F - ac t i n ( m M ) 0 50 100 150 200 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 0 100 200 300 400 0 . 0 2 . 0 4 . 0 6 . 0 8 . 0 0 50 100 150 Coordinate ( µm ) < d > ( n m ) 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 12 CP ( µM ) ActinArp2 / 3 CP Coordinate ( µm ) Time ( s ) Time ( s ) Arp2 / 3 CP ActinArp2 / 3 CP Arp2 / 3 CP c / c 0 F - ac t i n ( m M ) < d > ( n m ) c / c 0 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0100200300400500 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 3 . 0 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 400 800 1200 1600 3 . 0 C 0 ( µ M ) G 0 ( µM ) C 0 ( µ M ) G 0 ( µM ) a d b e c f B ( / µm 2 ) B ( / µm 2 ) Figure 5 . 7 : Effects of ﬁnite protein reservoirs on the network structure .

( d - f ) Shift - ing the capping rate from k CP = 12 / µ M / s ( a - c ) to k CP = 4 / µ M / s substantially changes the resulting network structure , as CP depletes slower than actin . Spatial parameters : R = 15 µ m and r = 4 . 5 µ m . 69 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels for k CP are reported from literature , however for CP originating from different organisms ( Schafer , D . A . , Jennings P . B . , Cooper J . A . , 1996 ; Shekhar et al . , 2015 ) . Future in vitro experiments could be designed to detect the predicted difference . Finally it is left for speculation , if cells make use of the described depletion mechanism to tune network architecture and force generation . 5 . 3 . 3 Reaction - diffusion oscillation Although the cellular protein pool may appear large , the assembly of a structure locally reduces the concentrations and diffusion equilibrates the local and global levels . This has been shown to affect lamellipodia ( Mogilner & Edelstein - Keshet , 2002 ) , as a high number of consumers competes for a low pool of actin ( Carlier & Pantaloni , 1997 ) . With a look on the coupled pool depletion discussed in the previous section , this raises the question how the dynamics of the activator system comes into play . The model identiﬁes a regime of oscillations , where the consumption of actin by a high number of plus ends creates a negative feedback loop . The model is extended by a spatial dimension ( ∀ X ∈ { V , V ∗ , A , B } : X ( t ) → X ( x , t ) ) . A simple geometry is assumed , where the concentrations of actin , CP and Arp2 / 3 diffuse from an unlimited pool at x 0 to the consuming network around x = 0 with a ﬁxed area πr 2 . ∂G ∂t = ( ( − k on G + k oﬀ ) B − k 1 GV + k 2 V ∗ ) χ + D G ∇ 2 G , ( 5 . 40 ) ∂C ∂t = − k CP CBχ + D C ∇ 2 C , ( 5 . 41 ) ∂A ∂t = ( − k 3 AV ∗ + k 4 A ∗ ) χ + D A ∇ 2 A , ( 5 . 42 ) χ = πr 2 N Avo , ( 5 . 43 ) where D G = 30 µ m 2 / s , D C = 26 µ m 2 / s and D A = 17 µ m 2 / s are the diffusion constants in water for actin , CP and Arp2 / 3 respectively , estimated by the Einstein - Stokes equation 1 . Initial values are set by the equilibrium values for the activator sys - tem , V 0 = 1 × 10 5 / µ m 2 , G 0 = 10 µ M , x 0 = 5 µ m , r = 2 . 9 µ m and binding rates are set to k Arp = 1 × 10 − 3 µ m 2 / s and k CP = 4 / µ M / s . For numerical reasons the geometry is symmetrised with another unlimited pool at x = − x 0 . The plus end density is described by a narrow Gaussian distri - bution of width s = 0 . 2 µ m , around the origin . However , an artiﬁcial degradation k cut is added that prevents the tail of the Gaussian from piling up over time .

( 5 . 45 ) 1 The diffusion in the cytosol ( McGrath et al . , 1998 ) or in presence of a network ( Plastino et al . , 2004a ) have been shown to be one order of magnitude lower for actin . 70 5 . 3 Time evolution 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 20 Arp2 / 3 ( µM ) c 0 . 08 0 . 10 0 . 12 CP ( µM ) B ( / µ m 2 ) 0 500 1000 1500 B ( / µ m 2 ) 0 500 1000 1500 a b 1200 1400 1600 1800 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 B G Arp2 / 3 CP 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 0 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 f ( m H z ) 0 1000 2000 3000 Time ( s ) 0 1000 2000 3000 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) s t ea d y g r o w t h s u pp r e ss e d c / c 0 CP0 . 1µM Arp2 / 3 0 . 1µM d Ratio ( Arp2 / 3 : CP ) oscillation Figure 5 . 8 : Diffusion - induced oscillatory steady state .

( d ) Phase diagram of steady state behaviour character - ised by the activity ratio Arp2 / 3 : CP . In between of the regimes of suppressed and steady growth , the oscillatory state is found , where the frequency depends approximately lin - early on the activity . The assumptions of the implementation have to be checked more concisely and hence the further analysis has to be regarded as a preliminary result . Taking into account the local concentrations and diffusion ﬂuxes changes the steady - state behaviour dramatically . The overshoot dynamics ( Section 5 . 3 . 1 ) can still be observed , however not throughout all concentration regimes . For lower Arp2 / 3 or higher CP concentrations , the plus end density starts to oscil - late , forming an alternating pattern of pulses and lag phases ( Fig . 5 . 8a , b ) . This behaviour can be understood looking at the coupled pool depletions ( Fig . 5 . 8c ) . A high amount of activated Arp2 / 3 induces a rising plus end density and as the dendritic network grows , the local concentrations of CP and G - actin drop down . Thereby , the activation of new Arp2 / 3 is decelerated and in turn CP is able to decrease the number of plus ends again . The many plus ends still request actin , keeping the actin in a low concentration regime . Thus the diffusive reﬂux of CP can fully suppress the slow new branch creation . With only few consumers left , the concentration levels equilibrate again , and as Arp2 / 3 rises , another avalanche of branching is unleashed , restarting the cycle . The oscillatory state is only found in a certain concentration regime . Char - acterising the activity by the ratio of Arp2 / 3 to CP , three regions appear in the phase diagram ( Fig . 5 . 8d ) . If the activity is too low , growth is suppressed and if the activity is sufﬁciently high , a steady assembly is found . In between , the activity tunes the frequency of the oscillation . Hypothetically , the transition to steady growth can be explained by the pulsed behaviour . While the width of the 71 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels pulses appears to be conserved , CP tunes the frequency by the length of the lag phase . When the periodic time becomes shorter than the duration of a pulse , adjacent pulses overlap , presumably causing the oscillation to fade out . This agrees to the measured half maximum widths of ≈ 100 s and phase boundary period of ≈ 250 s . In conclusion , the oscillatory steady state demonstrates the importance of diffusion effects for dendritic network assembly . The resulting temporal pat - tern is created by the auto - catalytic behaviour for the plus ends , that on a longer time - scale has a negative self - feedback by direct depletion of the ac - tivator and by slowing down the recreation of the activator by depletion of actin . In phases where CP dominates , it suppresses growth such efﬁcient , that the slow Arp2 / 3 diffusion can replenish the activator concentration until a critical value is reached , inducing cycles of activity . Further investigations are required to explore the emerging parameter space of concentrations and geometries and the effect of the different diffusion constants among the proteins . In living cells , periodic activity has been found in lamellipodia of embryonic mouse ﬁbroblasts ( Giannone et al . , 2004 ) and neural growth cones ( Betz et al . , 2009 ) . Interest - ingly , the persistence and frequency of the protrusion waves in epithelial cells , has been shown to depend on the relative abundance of activated Arp2 / 3 and G - actin ( Machacek & Danuser , 2006 ) . The oscillatory activity due to the reaction - diffusion kinetics of the activator system could provide a mechanism for spatio - temporal organisation in the cytoskeleton , additional to the well - established activator - inhibitor waves ( Weiner et al . , 2007 ; Inagaki & Katsuno ) . 5 . 4 Spatially resolved model The model discussed in the previous sections is focused on the binding kinetics and therefore assumed an inﬁnitely expanded system with biased growth per - pendicular to the membrane . However , in processes like endocytosis ( Mooren et al . , 2012 ) or in yeast actin patches ( Young et al . , 2004 ) , spatially delimited structures are required . Thus it is of interest , how a three dimensional ( 3D ) net - work is formed after the initiation of polymerisation on a surface . In that case , the growth processes tangential and perpendicular to the membrane are convo - luted . In the following , the model is extended to describe the transition from a ﬂat spreading on the membrane to a volume spanning dendritic growth . Thereby a mechanism is identiﬁed , that is able to spatially organise force exertion on the membrane . 5 . 4 . 1 Two - stage network growth Considering network growth starting from a seeding event , the assumption of an average growth direction perpendicular to the membrane is not applicable . As reported from experiments before ( Achard et al . , 2010 ) , the temporal de - velopment can be described by a two - stage model . In the ﬁrst stage ﬁlaments grow laterally away from a seed , creating a two dimensional ﬂat network on the 72 5 . 4 Spatially resolved model membrane . This is followed by a second stage where the network is growing effectively perpendicular to the membrane and thereby expands into the third dimension ( Fig . 5 . 9a ) . The network continuously spreads along the membrane and subsequently grows into the volume . As a consequence , the resulting geo - metry exhibits a ﬂat periphery in the ﬁrst growth stage and a three dimensional centre in the second growth stage . Here , the transition between the two stages is discussed at a ﬁxed position , while the next section adds the simultaneous lateral spreading process . A major difference of the two stages is the way how Arp2 / 3 can interact with actin , that should depend on the angle α between ﬁlament and membrane . The smaller the angle , the more interaction sites are offered to A ∗ . Hence a ﬂat region densiﬁes more rapidly than a 3D network . The enhancement of bind - ing sites is obtained by a geometrical consideration ( analogous to ( Carlsson , 2001 ) ) , assuming an interaction region on the membrane ( Fig . 5 . 9b ) : η = sin ( α 0 ) sin ( α ) − 1 , ( 5 . 46 ) where α 0 is the angle between membrane and ﬁlament in 3D growth , typically 55 ° . This relation is valid as long as the ﬁlament is not entirely inside the inter - action region , where binding should be proportional to the total F - actin units . The enhancement of binding sites η is used as a transition parameter to model the evolution from a 2D to a 3D network , modifying the existent model equations . In the ﬁrst growth stage , branching is ampliﬁed by η ( Eq . 5 . 47 ) . Thereby η is used up with a rate λ ( Eq . 5 . 48 ) until the branching occurs at the rate for a 3D network . ∂B ∂t = k Arp A ∗ B ( 1 + η ) − k CP C 0 B ( 5 . 47 ) ∂η ∂t = − k Arp A ∗ Bηλ ( 5 . 48 ) ∂V ∂t = − k 1 G 0 V + k 2 V ∗ + k Arp A ∗ B ( 1 + η ) ( 5 . 49 ) Reasonable limits for the ampliﬁcation parameters η and λ can be obtained by the comparison with a 2D model where branching is proportional to the total number of F - actin subunits ( Fig . 5 . 9c ) . Thereby the initial increase of the plus end density should be similar to the 2D case , yet never exceed it ( Fig . 5 . 9d ) . Furthermore , the transition region in which the ampliﬁcation decays to zero is assumed to be in the order of a few hundred nanometres . The transition model is able to describe the phenomenology of a two stage growth ( Achard et al . , 2010 ) , that also explains short onset times to a steady state reported in previous studies ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . Instead of deﬁning the regimes of growth piecewise , a continuous changeover to the original 3D model is provided , that returns steady functions for the network properties . However the parameters η and λ cannot capture the underlying processes , that presum - ably depend on the network elasticity and the force balance with the membrane . Special emphasis should be placed on the comparison of 2D and 3D growth . The model demonstrates the importance of ﬁlament orientation for dendritic net - work growth , where 2D growth presumably leads to a high nucleation activity 73 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels d α 0 α Membrane Arp2 / 3 * F - actin Interactionsites ∆ t 2D 3D a b 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 12 CP ( µM ) c d Time ( s ) 0° 20° 40° α 0 200 400 600 0 50 100 150 0 2 4 η B ( / µ m 2 ) Time ( s ) 0° 10° 20° 30° α 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 2 4 η 0 50 100 150 200 B ( / µ m 2 ) 2D3D transition Figure 5 . 9 : Transition between 2D and 3D growth .

( b ) Model for the number of Arp2 / 3 - actin interaction sites . Considering a region for branching of arbitrary width d , the number of interaction sites increases for more acute angles α by η = sin ( α 0 ) / sin ( α ) − 1 . ( c ) Comparison of a 2D model , where branching is propor - tional to the total amount of F - actin ( dotted lines ) , with the 3D model discussed in the previous sections ( continuous lines ) and the proposed transition model ( dashed lines ) . ( d ) In the initial phase , the parameters η and λ are set in agreement with the 2D model ( η 0 = 5 , λ = 0 . 01 ) . 74 5 . 4 Spatially resolved model that rapidly establishes high densities . This offers an opportunity for cellular structure formation , where a ﬂat growth can be enforced by NPFs like cortactin which do not immediately release Arp2 / 3 upon binding ( Egile et al . , 2005 ; Kirk - bride et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , angle - dependent branching kinetics imply a force feedback mechanism , as discussed in section 5 . 5 . 5 . 4 . 2 Three dimensional domain growth A major difference emerges , if the spreading of the actin network along the membrane is considered to take place at the same time as perpendicular growth . By this the symmetry of the previously inﬁnitely expanded system is broken . As the equilibration dynamics take place with a position dependent time offset , spatial gradients in network density and force exertion emerge . Their in - teraction with the membrane presumably creates curvatures that are required for endocytosis ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Galletta & Cooper , 2009 ) . Here , the growth of an actin domain originating from a single seeding event is investigated . Straightforwardly the model is extended by a radially symmetric spatial dimen - sion r ( ∀ X ∈ { V , V ∗ , A , B } : X ( t ) → X ( r , t ) ) . However , little is known about the spreading of the branched actin network along the membrane . Thus a simplistic description is chosen : the branching process is regarded as a random walk of the ﬁlament plus ends . Hence the lateral growth can be described by a diffusive term with constant D for the plus end density B . ∂B ∂t = k Arp A ∗ B ( 1 + η ) − k CP C 0 B + D ∇ 2 B ( 5 . 50 ) The initial values for V , V * and A * are set to their equilibrium values in the ab - sence of plus ends ( Eqs . 5 . 15 5 . 17 ) . The initial value for the plus ends B ( r , 0 ) is set to be a Gaussian distribution around r = 0 with σ = 10 nm normalised to 1 / µ m 2 , representing a small actin seed . Despite the assumption of diffusive branching the growth in r - direction is approximately linear after a short initial phase ( Fig . 5 . 10a ) . This is a con - sequence of the self - amplifying network growth process , comparable to trigger wave propagation on excitable media ( Tyson & Keener , 1988 ; Sakurai et al . , 2002 ) . As the spreading behaviour of real networks is widely unknown , the con - stant D is chosen to return spreading speeds in the range of the ﬁlament growth velocity . An alternative modelling approach would be a travelling Gaussian puls , with a deﬁned spreading velocity . The temporal evolution of the plus end density shows distinct gradients , de - pending on the CP concentration ( Fig . 5 . 10a , b ) . Thereby the equilibration dy - namics ( Section 5 . 3 . 1 ) are reﬂected in the emerging spatial distributions . During the spreading process , the periphery of the network encounters regions where a high amount of activated Arp2 / 3 is provided , since the activation system is in its equilibrium state A ∗ eq . Subsequently the plus end density rises and the activator is depleted . While the density increases continuously at low CP concentrations ( Fig . 5 . 10a ) , high CP levels create a transient overshoot before the density 75 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels 20406080100120140 50100150200250300350 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Time ( s ) r ( µ m ) B ( / µm 2 ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 Time ( s ) r ( µ m ) B ( / µm 2 ) a b 40nm / s 20nm / s 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 10 20 30 r ( µm ) r ( µm ) v ( n m / s ) v ( n m / s ) σ ( kPa ) 0 . 24 0 . 63 Time ( s ) 1 s 3 s 5 s c d ∆ Figure 5 . 10 : CP dependent polymerisation patterns .

( c ) - ( d ) Effect of load force on the velocity proﬁles . While the absolute values decrease under pressure , the relative peak hight ∆ increases , returning more pronounced proﬁles . decreases over time ( Fig . 5 . 10b ) . Remarkably , this effect is generated by the activator system alone , yet it can be further enhanced by the 2D - 3D transition model ( Section 5 . 4 . 1 ) . Importantly , the gradients in the plus end density not only vary the local net - work architecture , but moreover generate distinct patterns of force exertion that steer the perpendicular growth velocity . In ﬁrst approximation , however without respect to internal force distributions , the velocity can be estimated by the val - ues obtained for a single ﬁlament growing against a membrane ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) v = k on Gδ exp ( − ω / B ) , ( 5 . 51 ) ω = σδ / k B T , ( 5 . 52 ) where δ is the ﬁlament length increment per monomer , k B is Boltzmann’s con - stant , T is the temperature and σ is the counter - pressure provided by the mem - brane . If the velocity in the central region is larger than in the periphery , a convex network is formed ( Fig . 5 . 10c ) ; whereas larger velocities in the periphery lead to a concave shape ( Fig . 5 . 10d ) . Furthermore , the resulting force proﬁles can be tuned by the membrane tension : a higher membrane tension generates more expressed gradients . 76 5 . 5 Force feedback model In conclusion the model identiﬁes a mechanism to spatially organise force ex - ertion of the polymerising actin network . Remarkably , due to the activation sys - tem , pattern formation takes place without the need of building an initial gradient . Hence the effect is particularly interesting on low length and time scales . Addi - tionally , the model suggests that the high pressures required in distinct fast cell processes ( Basu et al . , 2014 ) can be generated . Future experiments will elude if the mechanism is realised in living cells , where processes like endocytosis rely on force gradients ( Carlsson & Bayly , 2014 ) . 5 . 5 Force feedback model Major aspects of dendritic networks are both the generation of forces and their behaviour under load ( Abu Shah & Keren , 2013 ) . Although recent studies have well characterised the mechanics ( Pujol et al . , 2012 ; Bieling et al . , 2016 ) , a the - oretical description of the force - feedback is still elusive ( Dmitrieff & Nedelec , 2016 ) . Here , based on the common theory of ﬁlamentous force exertion ( Mo - gilner & Oster , 1996a ) , the model is extended to describe dendritic network growth under load : A force dependent ﬁlament angle is introduced , explaining both feedback in the binding kinetics and the network density . Basic observations on network growth under load are , that both the plus end density and the actin density increase , however the stoichiometry of the con - stituents Arp2 / 3 , CP and actin stays constant ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) ( Fig . 5 . 11a ) . This suggests that the binding kinetics follow a similar force response while the actin network has to be compressed . Both effects can be explained by mechan - ical arguments , changing the average angle between ﬁlament and surface . As derived from standard thermodynamics for a ﬁlament pushing against a membrane under an angle β , the probability to elongate a ﬁlament by one monomer is scaled by a Boltzmann - distribution ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) : p ( β ) = exp (cid:18) − E 0 k B T (cid:19) , E 0 = fδ cos ( β ) ( 5 . 53 ) where f is the force encountered by the ﬁlament and δ is the ﬁlament length increment per monomer in forward growth . 5 . 5 . 1 Harmonic potential To further implement the geometry of the system , the ﬁlament angle is still as - sumed to be symmetric to the membrane normal vector . However ﬁlaments are now allowed to change their angle to the surface . Therefore membrane bending and surface energy as well as ﬁlament bending have to be taken into account ( Schaus et al . , 2007 ) . In a simplistic approximation , this is described by rods on a torsional spring ( Fig . 5 . 11b ) . Thus a harmonic potential is added to the angular dependent binding energy of a monomer ( as from Eq . 5 . 51 ) ) E K ( β ) = F N δ cos ( β ) + 1 2 K δ l ( β − β 0 ) 2 , ( 5 . 54 ) 77 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels P l u s e n d s ( / µ m 2 ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 F - ac t i n ( m M ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Load stress ( kPa ) β 0 β δ d 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 V e l o c i t y ( µ m / m i n ) 0 20 40 60 80 β ss ( ° ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Load stress ( kPa ) a c d e f b E 0 ( β ) E K ( β ) F ρ 0 < ρ F B 0 < B F F K F ext P 1 P 2 Lit B 0 / ρ 0 > B F / ρ F Figure 5 . 11 : Force feedback model for dendritic growth .

( c ) - ( f ) Simulation of network growth under load . Two exemplary parameter sets P 1 ( V 0 = 5000 / µ m 2 , k Arp = 1060 nm 2 s − 1 , K = 4 . 1 pN nm rad − 2 ) and P 2 ( V 0 = 2500 / µ m 2 , k Arp = 2750 nm 2 s − 1 , K = 3 . 7 pN nm rad − 2 ) are compared with ex - periments from literature ( Lit ) at ( G 0 = 5 µ M , A 0 = 0 . 1 µ M , C 0 = 0 . 1 µ M , k CP = 4 . 5 / µ M / s and k on = 9 . 1 / µ M / s ) ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . where FN denotes the share of the total force on a single ﬁlament ( that can also be expressed as σB ) and K is the force constant of the harmonic potential with the equilibrium angle β 0 . On the one hand , the ﬁrst term describes the energy required to build in a monomer , favouring higher β while on the other hand the second term accounts for the elastic energy stored in the network and drives the ﬁlament back to its equilibrium angle β 0 . Thereby the factor δ / l accounts for the share of the energy each subunit contains . Using this balance , the main model assumption is that steady - state growth adapts its average angle β ss such that the energy is minimised : β ss : = β ( E K ) (cid:12)(cid:12) d E d β = 0 ( 5 . 55 ) where β ( E K ) is the inverse function of E K ( β ) and β ∈ [ 0 , π / 2 ] . 78 5 . 5 Force feedback model Furthermore , the number of interaction sites between Arp2 / 3 * and a ﬁlament is rescaled according to the angle , as discussed in Section 5 . 4 . 1 . Thus the full set of equations is : ∂V ∂t = − k 1 G 0 V + k 2 V ∗ + cos ( β 0 ) cos ( β ) k Arp A ∗ B ( 5 . 56 ) ∂V ∗ ∂t = + k 1 G 0 V − k 2 V ∗ − k 3 A 0 V ∗ + k 4 A ∗ ( 5 . 57 ) ∂A ∗ ∂t = + k 3 A 0 V ∗ − k 4 A ∗ − cos ( β 0 ) cos ( β ) k Arp A ∗ B ( 5 . 58 ) ∂B ∂t = + cos ( β 0 ) cos ( β ) k Arp A ∗ B − k CP exp (cid:18) − E K k B T (cid:19) C 0 B ( 5 . 59 ) The system is solved numerically under the condition for β ss . Therefore valid initial conditions are set by a hypothetical very dense state with B 0 (cid:29) B ss , in which the force is distributed among many ﬁlaments and thus the angle is the one for a load free network β 0 = 35 ° . As the activator system cannot sustain the high ﬁlament density , the system relaxes into the steady state under load . It is an experimental observation that the stoichiometry of the network stays constant . Although more branches are created , the same number of monomers are built in before capping . Therefore the rates of capping k CP C 0 and polymer - isation k CP C 0 have to be rescaled by an equal factor exp ( − E K / k B T ) , despite the fact that CP is bigger and thus should react more sensitive to the angle . As a direct consequence of the model equations 5 . 55 - 5 . 59 , changing the av - erage angle leads to an increase in F - actin density at constant ﬁlament num - ber . Higher angles increases the number of accessible interaction sites between Arp2 / 3 and a ﬁlament and thus lead to denser networks . However this ampliﬁc - ation ﬂattens the higher the angle due to the saturation of the activator system , whereas the density increase of F - actin diverges at β = 90 ° . The modelled network properties are compared with published data ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) , obtaining parameter values for the binding constants from the non - load network properties . This has to be seen as an estimate , as also text and ﬁgures of the study are not fully consistent 2 . Throughout various parameter sets , the model matches the experiment , where the F - actin density increases faster than the number of plus ends ( Fig . 5 . 11c , d ) . However , the relative increase in F - actin is too low , especially in the initial phase , indicating that the angle initially should increase faster . Comparing the growth velocity , two ﬁlament elongation schemes are considered ( Fig . 5 . 11e ) . The ﬁrst scheme assumes the ﬁlament only to work against the load force ( E 0 ( β ) ) , while in the second the additional network elasticity acts against it as well ( E K ( β ) ) . Qualitatively the decay of the velocity is captured well by the model , yet the experiment lies in between , suggesting that the used energy function E K ( β ) is too high . Taken together , the simplistic model can explain the basic force feedback be - haviour . Presumably the harmonic potential does not return the right depend - ency of the angle on the load force and requires too high energies at higher angles . 2 The greatest mismatch is v text0 = 7 . 33 µ m / min and v plot0 ≈ 6 . 3 µ m / min 79 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels 5 . 5 . 2 Macroscopic elastic potential Before following the hypothesis , that another energy potential is required to de - scribe the force feedback mechanism more precisely , the proposed angle de - pendent ampliﬁcation of branch nucleation is further tested . The model predicts the relation between actin density ρ and plus end density B as follows : ρ = ˙ G ˙ x = Bv 0 δ cos ( β ) v 0 = B δ cos ( β ) , ( 5 . 60 ) where v 0 is the elongation speed of the ﬁlament . Using this relation , the angle β is extracted from the experimental data ( Fig . 5 . 12a , β Lit ) . Subsequently the model is tested reversely by omitting the assumption for E K ( β ) and applying the extracted values for β instead . A very good agreement in the densities ρ and B ( Fig . 5 . 12c , d , β Lit ) is found , suggesting that the model for the ampliﬁcation of branching is valid . To further calculate the growth velocity , an energy function is necessary . A promising approach is to adapt the macroscopic elasticity modulus , as it should represent an ensemble of microscopic ﬁlaments . It has been reported to go with ρ 0 . 6 ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) and hence the new energy function is deﬁned by : E K ( β ) = σ B δ cos ( β ) + 1 2 K δ l (cid:18) B δ cos ( β ) (cid:19) 0 . 6 ( cos ( β 0 ) − cos ( β ) ) 2 , ( 5 . 61 ) where K is an elastic constant 3 . The resulting velocity dependency on the load force shows remarkable agreement with the data ( Fig . 5 . 12b , β Lit ) . Finally , the entire model is tested and the average growth angle β is obtained by minimising the energy function . Looking at the energy landscape , that is adjusted by the setting of K , the experimental angle to stress relation ﬁts in very well , where it is only more shallow at low stresses ( Fig . 5 . 12a ) . The numerically calculated steady - state values for β deviate a little from the absolute minimum , presumably due to the negligence of terms in the total derivative . Overall , the model results agree excellently with the experimental data ( Fig . 5 . 12b - d , β E K ) . In conclusion , the force feedback of dendritic network growth can be under - stood by mechanistic arguments . Introducing an elastic potential and consider - ing the accessibility of interaction sites for branching is sufﬁcient to explain the increase in ﬁlament count and actin density as well as the decreasing growth velocity . Furthermore adapting the elastic potential from the macroscopic bulk modulus closely ﬁts experimental ﬁndings . Already the simplistic assumption of symmetric growth of straight ﬁlament re - turns a high accordance to experimental observations . However , there are many opportunities for future work to reﬁne the model . Analogous to previous work ( Mogilner & Oster , 1996b ) , more sophisticated energy partition sums should be derived from beam bending theory ( Landau et al . , 1986 ) and moreover include the membrane energy ( Schaus et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , comparing the en - ergy functions obtained for single beams with the currently employed potential 3 The unit of K is currently 1 Jm 1 . 8 . A reasonable normalisation has to be added inside the bracket . 80 5 . 6 Model discussion 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 V e l o c i t y ( µ m / m i n ) c d b E K ( pNnm ) Lit P l u s e n d s ( / µ m 2 ) 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 F - ac t i n ( m M ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Load stress ( kPa ) 40 50 60 70 80 90 123456789 β ( ° ) 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 Load stress ( kPa ) a β Lit β E K Figure 5 . 12 : Force feedback model using the macroscopic elastic potential .

A more resolved understanding of the local ﬁlament angle will also improve the modelling of the network growth velocity and the ampliﬁcation of branching . Further improvements could also include the lever arm of force exertion ( Dmitrieff & Nedelec , 2016 ) or detailed asymmetric ﬁlament angle distributions ( Koestler et al . , 2008 ) . 5 . 6 Model discussion The main idea of the model is the understanding of the basic behaviour of dend - ritic growth which is evidently far away from a complete description . Simplicity is emphasised and therefore the main focus is set on the kinetic equations . By this , basic results can be obtained analytically to provide a guidance when analysing more complex effects later on . An advantage of the approach is that the model does only require a minimum number of free parameters . Nearly all reaction rates and concentrations can be taken from literature , at least providing the right order of magnitude . The only exception is the Arp2 / 3 - ﬁlament interaction rate k Arp . Notably , as k Arp describes the interaction rate of two particle densities , its dimension is the one of a diffu - 81 Chapter 5 Polymerising actin - Arp2 / 3 - CP gels sion constant . Hence the order of magnitude is assumed to be comparable to diffusion constants of the molecules . While the Einstein - Stokes equation returns a high value for three dimensional diffusion ( ≈ 50 µ m 2 / s in water ) it is known that membrane bound two dimensional diffusion is much slower . As a comparison , the diffusion of small G - proteins is reduced by two orders of magnitude upon binding ( from 10 – 50 µ m 2 / s to 0 . 1 µ m 2 / s ) ( Postma & van Haastert , 2001 ; Postma et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed values around k Arp = 0 . 01 µ m 2 / s return reasonable results in the simulation . Moreover the branch creation is not fully resolved on a molecular level . After binding to the ﬁlament , VCA is modelled to return immediately to its unbound state . However , it is shown that different nucleation promotion factors stay bound for some time ( Egile et al . , 2005 ) . This bond is particularly interesting , since it is capable to transmit traction forces ( Marcy et al . , 2004 ) and provides a connec - tion between network and membrane ( Co et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore a bound intermediate state creates a dead - time for the VCA , lowering the replenishment of activated Arp2 / 3 , presumably enhancing the observed activator depletion ef - fects . It is to remark that the binding kinetics of the activation process are in fact far more complicated , as they allow all permutations of complexation , while the model only includes the most likely pathway ( Ti et al . , 2011 ) . Another assumption of the model is the absence of diffusion effects . This is justiﬁed by the fact that diffusion ( D cytosolactin = 3 – 6 µ m 2 / s , ( McGrath et al . , 1998 ) and D wateractin = 30 µ m 2 / s ( Lanni & Ware , 1984 ) is faster than network growth such that the particle uptake is low compared to the diffusive ﬂow . Furthermore recent ex - periments report , that diffusion effects do not play a role in relatively large - scale systems in the order of 10 µ m 2 ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . However , as suggested by other studies as well ( Carlsson , 2001 ; Plastino et al . , 2004a ) , sections 5 . 3 . 2 and 5 . 3 . 3 show that the dendritic assembly reacts sensitively to changes in local concentrations and thus it has to be checked concisely if diffusion can be neg - lected . Furthermore directionality and homogeneity of the networks are highly over - estimated , since the model treats all quantities as a continuum , evaluating only expectational values for the ensemble and neglecting stochastic deviations . Thereby new branches are always pointing towards the membrane and back - ward branching is neglected . This is justiﬁed , because ﬁlaments that are distant from the membrane do not gain further branches and thereby do not affect fur - ther growth . However , a term describing this backward branching can easily be introduced to Eq . 5 . 20 . On average , growth is perpendicular to the surface and all actin branches arrange in a symmetrical angle around the normal vec - tor . This neglects three dimensional effects that result in more complex angle distributions . Together with statistical ﬁlament lengths and branch points , this presumably heavily affects the force generated by each ﬁlament on the mem - brane ( Dmitrieff & Nedelec , 2016 ; Weichsel & Schwarz , 2010 ) . The assumption of a passive rear part of the network is justiﬁed , as the un - binding of CP and branch detachment are slow processes on the time scales of 10 3 s and 10 4 s respectively ( Le Clainche et al . , 2003 ; Shekhar et al . , 2015 ) . Related to that , the transition from ATP to ADP actin is not implemented , as it 82 5 . 7 Conclusion should only come into play for severing mechanisms ( Pollard & Borisy , 2003 ) . Furthermore it is assumed that capped ﬁlaments immediately belong to the passive parts and cannot be branched any more . This is justiﬁed for sufﬁciently high growth speeds ( Mogilner & Edelstein - Keshet , 2002 ) , however may not be the case in the low actin regime or if ﬁlaments grow in a ﬂat angle to the mem - brane . 5 . 7 Conclusion Including the activation step of Arp2 / 3 and geometrical considerations into a kinetic model adds important details to the description of dendritic network as - sembly . Thereby the activation step introduces a physically meaningful satura - tion for branch formation and also clariﬁes the way how NPFs regulate network growth . A spatio - temporal modelling grants insights into the assembly of func - tional force - exerting structures and their feedback to external forces . The analysis of steady - state growth identiﬁes a low actin regime , where activ - ation is impeded . This provides a negative feedback on branch creation at high plus end densities that consume high amounts of actin . Additionally , growth can be switched on by increasing only one protein species above a critical concen - tration . As a further consequence of the steady states , the activator system provides a higher amount of activated Arp2 / 3 in absence of a network than during poly - merisation . By this , the initial phase of growth exhibits an enhanced branching activity and its equilibration to steady state creates gradients in network proper - ties . Considering a simultaneous lateral spreading of the network , these gradi - ents generate distinct patterns of force exertion , which presumably shape the membrane into concave and convex structures . This effect is even enhanced if a two - stage growth is assumed , where the actin ﬁlaments initially grow ﬂat to the membrane and thus expose more interaction sites for branching . Gradient network architectures also emerge if the protein solution concentra - tions are limited . The assembly of the network depletes these pools in a coupled manner , that depends on the ratio between the binding constants . Thereby the relative concentrations of the pools continuously change , altering the network properties . While a substantial change in the pool concentrations may not occur in cells , the effect of coupled depletion strikingly comes into play if diffusion is taken into account . The different binding rates and diffusion speeds of the pro - tein species in combination with the negative feedback of high ﬁlament densities on branching can even lead to an oscillatory steady state , where bursts of poly - merisation alternate with lag phases . Dendritic networks also to respond to external forces . Under load , they densify and create higher forces themselves . This feedback can be explained by mechanistic arguments , assuming branch nucleation to be dependent on the ﬁlament angle and ﬁlament elongation to work against both membrane and network elasticity . Adapting the elastic potential from the macroscopic bending modulus returns excellent agreement with experimental observations . 83 Chapter 6 Outlook Understanding the cytoskeleton in all its complexity is a daunting task . How - ever , great challenges have always been an inspiration for humankind and it is especially motivating that further insights will promote medical breakthroughs . Early on in the 1970s , the drug taxol was found for cancer therapy ( Wani et al . , 1971 ) . It acts as a toxin that suppresses cell division by stabilisation of the microtubules , which affects tumor cells more than healthy ones . This identiﬁed microtubules as a promising target for drugs and further cytoskeletal inhibitors followed ( Jordan & Wilson , 2004 ) . However , the applied principle of action is rather blunt and causes severe side effects . A detailed knowledge about cytoskeletal assemblies like the spindle should offer not only more , but also more speciﬁc ways to manipulate them . Over the last decades , huge progress has been made , notably by the interplay of in vivo , in vitro , in silico and theoretical work . Myriads of cytoskeletal proteins have been identiﬁed ( Pollard & Goldman , 2017 ) and the structure of their as - semblies becomes resolved in unprecedented detail ( Picco et al . , 2015 ; Henson et al . , 2017 ) . In vitro experiments have granted insights into fundamental pro - cesses like ﬁlament bundling ( Lieleg & Bausch , 2007 ) , network percolation ( Al - varado et al . , 2013 ) and the assembly of contractile units ( Thoresen et al . , 2011 ) . At the same time , the theoretical framework of active gel physics has been de - veloped to describe the motor - driven polymer gels ( Prost et al . , 2015 ) . Addition - ally , the increase in computational power enables numerical simulations of cyto - skeletal dynamics on the particle level even on ofﬁce computers ( Letort et al . , 2015 ) . Physical models became capable of describing complex processes , like the self - organisation of the spindle ( Brugues & Needleman , 2014 ) and cleav - age furrow constriction ( Turlier et al . , 2014 ) during cytokinesis , cell migration ( Danuser et al . , 2013 ) and morphogenesis ( Fletcher et al . , 2014 ) . Nowadays , more complex in vitro models aim for the creation of cell - mimic systems or even synthetic cells ( Blain & Szostak , 2014 ) . Along that road , the creation of an artiﬁcial actomyosin cortex presented in this thesis and in Loiseau et al . ( 2016 ) is an important step in studying the interplay of the cytoskeleton with the membrane . Further insights are also gained by studying the adhesion of cell - mimics on substrates ( Sackmann & Smith , 2014 ) . Therefore , active nematic vesicles could be utilised to add a deﬁned , periodic force exertion , presumably 85 Chapter 6 Outlook combined with ﬂuorescent force sensor proteins ( Freikamp et al . , 2016 ) . A vis - ionary view already sees their application as micro - robots ( Sato et al . , 2017 ) . More sophisticated cell - mimic models should include actin turnover ( Carlier & Shekhar , 2017 ) . The dynamic equilibrium between actin polymerisation and disassembly , called treadmilling , is neglected in most state - of - the - art actin sys - tems , as it has not been reconstructed bottom - up so far . However , treadmilling is an essential feature and makes the difference between an equilibrium as - sembly and a dynamic self - organising system ( Karsenti , 2008 ) . Recent theoret - ical work has already demonstrated the importance of turnover for actomyosin contractions ( Hiraiwa & Salbreux , 2016 ) and the creation of dynamic steady states ( Oelz & Mogilner , 2016 ) . Furthermore , a future challenge will be sym - metry breaking . Cells polarise either spontaneously , or as a response to ex - ternal stimuli and cytoskeletal structures form accordingly ( Levayer & Lecuit , 2012 ) . Hence , a break in symmetry will be required for the reconstitution of many complex assemblies and therefore could be induced artiﬁcially . However , its emergence from self - organisation of molecular assemblies is a fascinating topic as well ( Pohl , 2015 ; Verkhovsky , 2015 ) . Thereby , it will be a benchmark for in vitro systems to establish the global , motor - induced chirality that is observed in vivo ( Naganathan et al . , 2016 ) . Strategies to induce symmetry breaking can be manifold . Interestingly , already a decade ago it was shown that conﬁnement is sufﬁcient to induce actin ring formation ( Claessens et al . , 2006 ) , however it was used for reconstruction of a rudimentary contractile ring only recently ( Miyazaki et al . , 2015 ) . Current the - oretical work elucidated a generic mechanism to establish geometry - sensitive protein gradients that could be used to couple on subsequent assembly pro - cesses ( Thalmeier et al . , 2016 ) . In a simplistic approach , the shape of the sys - tems could be modiﬁed by external matrices , adhesion or polymer gels . The latter has been demonstrated here on the microtubule vesicles and further work showed the rearrangement of an active microtubule layer under conﬁnement ( Is - lam et al . , 2017 ) and hypothesized the creation of motile systems by adhesion ( Khoromskaia & Alexander , 2015 ) . Additionally , the spindle - like state in the ves - icles could offer a nifty way to produce elongated shapes , whereby tuning the long axis elongation speed may serve for a temporal control of the assembly ( Fig . 6 . 1 ) . More ways to break the symmetry are provided by the membrane , where a rich interplay between phase separated lipids and the cytoskeleton is found in vivo ( Sezgin et al . , 2017 ) . Thereby , photo - switchable lipids can be util - ised to induce vesicle shape transitions ( Pernpeintner et al . , 2017 ) or lipid raft formation ( Frank et al . , 2016 ) . Similarly , localised photo - activation of motors can deﬁne arbitrary patterns of contractility ( Schuppler et al . , 2016 ; Linsmeier et al . , 2016 ) . The formation of complex cytoskeletal structures requires deﬁned spatio - temporal gradients . Therefore , a key principle in two and three dimensions are Turing patterns that emerge from reaction - diffusion kinetics ( Epstein & Xu , 2016 ) . Further important organisation mechanisms originate in the actin nuc - leators ( Skau & Waterman , 2015 ) and current studies show their signiﬁcant ef - fect on network architecture and cell mechanics ( Fritzsche et al . , 2016 ) . This 86 Figure 6 . 1 : Schematic of a contractile ring inside a spindle - like vesicle . Both spindle microtubule ( blue ) conﬁguration and an equatorial actin ( red ) ring assemble due to the volume depletion effect inside a vesicle ( cyan ) . Thereby the spindle could serve to counteract contractile forces of the ring . Depending on the time - scales of extension and contraction , the ring either strips off towards the poles , or is able to contract when the extending spindle loses connectivity in the central region . thesis identiﬁed a reaction - diffusion oscillation and a solitary activation pulse for gradient generation as well as a force - feedback in polymerising actin networks . However , subsequent studies are left to investigate , if these mechanisms occur in vitro or in vivo . Recent works has also demonstrated nematic ordering effects on the self - organisation of actin ( Alvarado et al . , 2014 ; Gupta et al . , 2015 ) . Despite all recent advances , cytoskeletal self - organisation remains still far from being fully understood . However , deciphering the underlying principles of biological assemblies will also promote material science and non - equilibrium physics – even if we cannot yet build an entire cell bottom - up . 87 List of Figures 1 . 1 Schematics of fuctional cellular structures . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 2 . 1 Droplets on a hydrophobic layer of paraﬁlm . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 2 . 2 Plate reader setup for the measurement of gel contraction . . . . 13 2 . 3 Cylindrical gel geometry in capillaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 3 . 1 Schematics of nematic order and defects . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 3 . 2 Assembly of active nematic vesicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 3 . 3 Dynamics of four + ½ defects on a spherical vesicle surface . . . 21 3 . 4 Oscillatory dynamics of topological defects . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 3 . 5 A theoretical model predicts oscillatory dynamics . . . . . . . . . 24 3 . 6 ATP - dependence of defect motion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 3 . 7 Coupling of vesicle shape and defect velocity . . . . . . . . . . . 26 3 . 8 Size - dependent morphology of ﬂexible active nematic vesicles . 27 3 . 9 Dynamics of ring - mode and spindle - like vesicles . . . . . . . . . 29 3 . 10 Actively driven vesicle shape deformations . . . . . . . . . . . . 30 3 . 11 Excess membrane induces deformations . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31 3 . 12 Active vesicles in actin networks of different density . . . . . . . 33 3 . 13 Active vesicles in a contracting actin - myosin gel . . . . . . . . . 35 4 . 1 Schematics of contractile actin - myosin gels . . . . . . . . . . . . 38 4 . 2 Spherical contraction in macroscopic droplets . . . . . . . . . . . 40 4 . 3 Final compacted state . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41 4 . 4 Residual gel surrounding the sphere . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41 4 . 5 Adhesion organises actin - myosin gels in - cell mimicking vesicles . 44 4 . 6 Adhesion modulates the contraction in macroscopic droplets . . 45 4 . 7 Surface to volume effect on contractile gels in droplets . . . . . . 46 4 . 8 Adhesion and detachment in cell - mimicking vesicles . . . . . . . 47 4 . 9 Asymmetric boundaries induce non - isotropic contraction . . . . . 49 4 . 10 Contraction dynamics in a rectangular geometry . . . . . . . . . 50 4 . 11 Marcroscopic internal adhesion sites reorganise contractile gels . 51 4 . 12 Internalised objects induce gel percolation . . . . . . . . . . . . 52 5 . 1 Schematic of binding kinetics and structure generation . . . . . . 54 5 . 2 Schematics of dendritic network properties . . . . . . . . . . . . 57 5 . 3 VCA - Arp2 / 3 activation system . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60 5 . 4 Steady polymerisation dynamics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63 89 5 . 5 Critical concentrations as a requisite for network growth . . . . . 65 5 . 6 Equilibration of polymerisation and activation . . . . . . . . . . . 67 5 . 7 Effects of ﬁnite protein reservoirs on the network structure . . . . 69 5 . 8 Diffusion induced oscillatory steady state . . . . . . . . . . . . . 71 5 . 9 Transition between 2D and 3D growth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74 5 . 10 CP dependent polymerisation patterns . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 76 5 . 11 Force feedback model for dendritic growth . . . . . . . . . . . . . 78 5 . 12 Force feedback model using the macroscopic elastic potential . . 81 6 . 1 Schematic of a contractile ring inside a spindle - like vesicle . . . . 87 90 Bibliography Abkarian , M . , Loiseau , E . , and Massiera , G .
