Spudich , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , and approved April 30 , 2010 ( received for review March 19 , 2010 ) In order to understand the mechanism of muscle contraction at the atomic level , it is necessary to understand how myosin binds to actin in a reversible way . We have used a novel molecular dynamics technique constrained by an EM map of the actin - myosin complex at 13 - Å resolution to obtain an atomic model of the strong - binding ( rigor ) actin - myosin interface . The constraining force resulting from the EM map during the molecular dynamics simulation was suffi - cient to convert the myosin head from the initial weak - binding state to the strong - binding ( rigor ) state . Our actin - myosin model suggests extensive contacts between actin and the myosin head ( S1 ) . S1 binds to two actin monomers . The contact surface between actin and S1 has increased dramatically compared with previous models . A number of loops in S1 and actin are involved in establish - ing the interface . Our model also suggests how the loop carrying the critical Arg 405 Glu mutation in S1 found in a familial cardio - myopathy might be functionally involved . cryoelectron microscopy ∣ myosin II ∣ myosin V T he binding of myosin to actin can be weak or strong . The affinity , which changes over 5 orders of magnitude , is con - trolled by ATP binding to the myosin head at a position remote from the actin binding site . ATP binding produces “ weak binding . ” In the absence of ATP the binding is “ strong . ” The mechanism of this interaction and its control by ATP is central to an understanding of muscle contraction ( 1 ) . Thus we need to know the structure of the strong - binding state of myosin to actin in atomic detail . Attempts to crystallize the complex have been unsuccessful . However , incubating myosin heads ( subfrag - ment 1 , S1 ) with filamentous actin ( f - actin ) produces “ decorated actin ” in which each myosin head binds to the actin filament in the strong - binding or “ rigor ” configuration . Decorated actin may be used as a model of the actin - myosin “ strong - binding ” mode . Cryoelectron microscopy and 3D reconstructions of actin deco - rated with myosin II have produced a density map at 13 - Å reso - lution ( 2 ) . Combining this with structural data from the head of myosin V , which can be crystallized in the strong - binding myosin conformation ( 3 ) , gave a near - atomic view of the actin - myosin rigor interaction ( 4 ) . The actin binding site comprises parts of the upper and lower 50 - K domains that are separated by a cleft in the weak - binding form . The cleft closes on strong binding . However , the interface appears incomplete : Some additional lo - cal refolding of myosin and actin appears to be necessary . We have now used constrained molecular dynamics — molecular dy - namics flexible fitting ( MDFF ) ( 5 ) to fit atomic models into the interface using the EM density map as a constraint . In MDFF the gradient of the density is used as an extra force field . It appears that , in addition to the elements of the upper and lower 50 - K domains recognized in the earlier study , part of the flexible loop 2 between the upper and lower 50 - K domains in S1 and the actin - DNase I binding loop in actin form essential parts of the interface . Furthermore , loop 4 in S1 ( sequence 364 – 380 ) located close to the cardiomyopathy loop ( sequence 400 – 418 ) and loop 3 ( sequence 567 – 577 ) move in toward the actin binding interface , suggesting contacts with two actin monomers . Similar molecular dynamics studies were undertaken previously without EM restraints ( 6 ) . However , compared with the previous study our studies indicate about twice the area of interaction . Results The First Run with Unconstrained Coordinates . As starting coordi - nates for f - actin we used PDB ID code 2ZWH derived from X - ray fiber diffraction data ( 7 ) . For myosin II we used the crystal - lographic coordinates 2MYS ( 8 ) . MD trajectories are often more stable with crystallographically derived coordinates . Since the coordinates of f - actin were the output from an MD process , we replaced each of the two main domains of the actin monomer coordinates with the best overlaid coordinates from 1J6Z for each domain ( 9 ) taking over just the DNAse I binding loop and C terminus from 2ZWH . This ensures good secondary struc - ture for the starting coordinates . Moreover , the 2MYS coordi - nates needed to be modified by removing the added methyl groups from the surface lysines [ 2MYS crystal structure was solved with methylated surface lysines ( 8 ) ] and by adding the missing side chain coordinates to the light chain C α coordinates ( this has no effect on the actin - myosin interface ) . Initially , the atomic coordinates were fitted to the EM density as rigid bodies by least squares . Subsequently an MD trajectory was run for 5 ns . The 2MYS coordinates of myosin II are in the postpower stroke weak - binding form , whereas the EM density data are derived from the rigor - like strong - binding form ( 4 ) . Therefore , we antici - pated quite big changes on running an MD simulation . Indeed , under the influence of the strong - binding ( rigor ) EM density the myosin II coordinates deform to become very much like 1W8J of myosin V ( 10 ) , which is already in the strong - binding form . The actin binding cleft closes and the β - sheet ( Fig . 1 B ) takes on the more twisted configuration shown by myosin V . In addition , part of loop 2 ( see Fig . 1 B ) initially inserted as random coil was moved into the actin - myosin interface ( residues 633 – 640 and 643 – 646 ) . The final MDFF calculations were carried out in the absence of water because embedding the acto - S1 complex in a water box showed the same overall features such as the closing of the actin binding cleft . We found that calculations in vacuum were suffi - cient in order to uncover the main structure segments and loops that participate in the acto - S1 interaction . The map force scaling was set to 0 . 2 in order to avoid it dominating the MD simulation . The final model used five actin monomers to allow the major S1 - binding actin monomer ( AC3 ; see Fig . 1 A for an explanation ) all possible interactions with neighboring actins . The EM density force was not applied to the lever arm in S1 ( residues 795 – 843 ) , the regulatory light chain and the essential light chain . The results are shown in Fig . 2 . The first runs displayed a number of problems including a tendency to shift the structure toward the actin helix axis caused by a small but significant radial fall off of the EM density . Also the limited resolution of the EM density map resulted in strong gradients near the edges of the molecule , which caused some Author contributions : M . L . and K . C .

Moreover , parts of loop 2 were pushed into the actin - myosin interface rather indiscriminately . Nevertheless , the final model we obtained showed a good match with the myosin V motor domain structure ( 10 ) . The over - lay shown ( Fig . 3 ) was calculated in a highly extensible program for interactive visualization and analysis of molecular structures , called Chimera ( 11 ) , based on secondary structure elements , showing the converged myosin II structure in blue and the myosin V structure in red . The actin binding cleft in myosin II closed and the β - sheet took on the more twisted conformation found in myosin V that is thought to represent the strong - binding confor - mation of S1 ( 12 ) . The rmsd between the starting model and the converged mod - el was slightly more than 7 Å after 5 ns of MD simulation , using backbone atoms of five actin monomers and S1 for the RMSD calculation ( Fig . S1 , SI Text ) . Even though the MDFF runs converged after 1 – 2 ns , the refinements were extended to over 5 ns to ensure convergence . Modeling Myosin II in the Strong - Binding Form . To counter the pro - blems described in the previous section we first generated starting coordinates of myosin II in the strong - binding form based as far as possible on crystallographically derived coordinates . Then harmonic constraints were applied to areas not close to the inter - face to prevent unwarranted movement . Previous studies ( 12 ) showed that myosin V without bound nucleotide is in the strong - binding form . As described above , unconstrained refinement of myosin II starting in the weak - bind - ing state transforms into a myosin V strong - binding ( rigor - like ) state when exposed to the map force ( see Fig . 3 ) . Thus myosin V provides a good template for modeling myosin II in its strong - binding state . The head of myosin II can be divided into three domains ( upper 50 - K , lower 50 - K , and N - C domain ) each of which is very similar in structure to the corresponding domain in myosin V . The 50 - K upper , 50 - K lower , and N - C - terminal domain of myosin II weak binding and myosin V strong binding canbematched separately ontoone anotherwith highcoincidence ( SI Text ) . It transpires that two rotational transformations of the individualdomainssufficetobringthewholestructureofmyosinIIintogoodcoincidencewithmyosinV . By using these transforma - tions to generate starting coordinates we are able to preserve the crystallographic quality of the data . For myosin V we used chain A of 1W8J ( 10 ) . The two mole - cules were brought to similar orientations by overlaying the lower 50 - K domains ( Fig . S2 , SI Text ) . Then the upper 50 - K domain of myosin II weak binding may be fitted to myosin V strong binding by a 22° rotation of the upper 50 - K domain around an axis that runs approximately along the β - sheet and is roughly at right an - gles to the helix axis . The N - C - terminal domain may be treated in the same way . Superposition of the N - C - terminal domain from myosin II ( yel - low , Fig . S3 , SI Text ) on myosin V ( apple green , Fig . S3 , SI Text ) is achieved by a rotation of 8 . 1° around an axis that runs close to strand 3 of the β - sheet . Because this axis lies close to the domain boundary , the rotation amounts to an 8 . 1° bending of the β - sheet . The converter domain carries the long light chain bearing lever arm of myosin . The orientation of the converter domain achieved by the process outlined above leads to a positioning of the lever arm that is in excellent agreement with the EM density map . The two rotations described above produced a model of myosin 2 in the strong - binding form ( Figs . S4 and S5 , SI Text ) . Adding the Missing Loops . Loop1 . Loop 1 in myosin II ( 199 – 219 ) is disordered as in most myosin structures . The residues from 205 – 215 are missing in 2MYS ( 8 ) and thus were model built and inserted as a random coil and were not exposed to the map force or harmonic constraints . Loop2 . Loop 2 , between the upper and lower 50 - K domains , is disordered in most myosin S1 structures . It is missing in 2MYS from residues 627 – 646 . However , initial studies described above showed that at least some of loop 2 is involved in the actin - myosin interface . The resolution of the map is too low to build the missing structure without initial modeling . We have constructed the part of loop 2 that appears to be involved in actin binding by hand using the EM map and crystallographic data from dictyos - telium myosin II as a guide . Loop 2 is of variable length and is rich in lysine and glycine residues . At the C terminus of the loop ( 647 in skeletal myosin II ; 635 in myosin V ) is an invariant threonine at the N terminus of helix W ( 649 – 667 ) . The eight residues on the N - terminal side of the threonine are conserved in myosin II . They are quite different in myosin V ( loop 2 is also much longer ) and indeed in all other myosins . The N terminus of loop 2 is marked by an invariant phe - nylalanine . Dictyostelium discoideum myosin II ( Dd ) is unusual because the loop 2 region is short — it has only 16 residues . The whole of loop 2 is visible in 2AKA ( 13 ) and shows a β - hairpin . The form taken may be indicative of a preferred fold of the poly - peptide chain . Therefore , we have built an extended polypeptide chain ( working from C to N ) toward the actin surface from the beginning of the W helix into a type - 2 β - bend . After the bend an Fig . 1 .

This configuration lies entirely within that part of the EM den - sity that was empty in earlier fits . With the given build , the Phe 646 that is invariant in myosin II interacts with the Pro 602 of the “ strut ” ( 14 ) , which is common to all myosin II ( see Fig . 4 ) . This may be a stabilizing interaction . Furthermore , on strong binding of skeletal myosin II to actin , the sequence between Gly 634 and Gln 647 would become an ordered part of the actin binding site , in which case all the trypsin - sensitive lysine residues would be - come unavailable for tryptic cleavage . This would provide a nice explanation of the protection of loop 2 from tryptic attack when myosin is bound to actin ( 15 ) . Murphy and Spudich ( 16 ) also found that changes in loop 2 altered the affinity of S1 for actin both in the absence and presence of nucleotide . Chaussepied ( 17 ) proposed that residues 633 – 642 in S1 are already essential for the weak - binding state of the acto - S1 complex . Loop3 . Loop 3 was completed by inserting the three missing re - sidues 572 – 574 . It is located in the lower 50 - K domain of S1 from residues 567 – 577 and moves toward AC1 ( first actin monomer ; see Fig . 1 A ) during the MDFF refinement . This possible contact was already suggested by an earlier EM reconstruction ( 18 ) . We refer to myosin II matched onto myosin V and with loops rebuilt as described as “ myo2 - 5 . ” Refinement of Myo2 - 5 . We used myo2 - 5 as a starting model for several MD runs in MDFF with slightly altered parameters . In addition to the secondary structure preserving energy function described in the Materials and Methods , we added harmonic con - straints to several areas of actin and S1 . The harmonic constraints were applied to the C α atoms of the designated areas in the molecules and were slightly altered for the three different runs in MDFF . The scaling of the density force from the EM map was also changed . Parameters are shown in Table S1 ( SI Text ) . The MD runs in MDFF were carried out for 5 ns for models 1 and 2 where the density force was set to 0 . 1 and for 3 ns for model 3 where the density force was set to 0 . 2 . For all three models we calculated the acto - S1 contact surface and the potential intermolecular H bonds and potential electro - static interaction . The surface areas are shown in Table 1 . S1 not only makes major contacts with the actin monomer ( AC3 ) but also with the monomer ( AC1 ) below the major actin monomer in the actin helix ( see Fig . 1 A ) . The measurements of the contact surface area are in good agreement with previous results ( 19 ) . The solvent accessible surface areas were calculated with visual mole - culardynamics ( VMD ) ( 20 ) usingthe “ measuresasa ” routine ( 20 ) . The sasa - parameter “ sradius , ” which is the additional value in Åaddedtotheatomicradiusinordertoscanthesolventaccessiblearea , was set to 1 . 4 Å . Furthermore , to regularize the result produced by the uncon - strained refinement of the DNase I binding loop , the rather similar crystallographic coordinates of the loop from the actin : DNase I crystal structure 1ATN ( 21 ) were inserted into the actin coordinates . This enhanced the interface with S1 by moving the DNase I binding loop into the S1 contact area as is described in the following section . All three models converged to a similar result with the same loops and segments being involved in the actin - S1 interface . The details of the residues involved in contacts between actin and S1 varied with the altered loop and harmonic constraint con - ditions , thereby providing an estimate of the accuracy of the method . The rms deviations of the three models from each other ranged between 1 . 0 and 1 . 1 Å . From the initial MYS2 coordinates of myosin II used in the unconstrained first runs , the values ran - ged between 4 . 7 and 4 . 9 Å ( the rmsd values were determined by selecting the backbone atoms of significant secondary structure elements of the 50 - K upper and 50 - K lower domains , resulting in 165 residues ) . In the next section we describe the details of model 1 where the nucleotide binding pocket of S1 was preserved by applying strong harmonic constraints to the P loop and switch 1 ( these already had the geometry of the strong - binding state because myosin II had been matched onto myosin V ) . The rmsd of the actin structure from the initial starting coor - dinates was 1 . 3 Å , mainly resulting from the regions that make actin - S1 contacts and actin - actin contacts . The rmsd of the heavy chain of S1 from the initial starting coordinates was 2 . 6 Å . The Actin - Myosin Interface of Model 1 . The refinement of the acto - S1 complex using MDFF ( 5 ) shows strong interactions not only from S1 to AC3 ( the major actin binding site ) but also from S1 to AC1 , which increases the contact surface and probably stabilizes the strong - binding state . Fig . 5 shows the binding site of the acto - S1 complex in stereo . ContactsofS1withAC3 . The binding of S1 to AC3 ( see Fig . 1 A ) shows a stable contact surface with S1 of 1 ; 385 Å 2 as shown in Table 1 . The contact surface indicates several potential electro - static interactions and H bonds . The interaction between the lower 50 - K domain and actin described in ref . 4 — helix and bulge Fig . 3 .

Potential candidates for H bonds between S1 and AC3 are mainly found in the loops of S1 , namely , loop 2 , loop 4 , and the cardiomyopathy loop ( see Fig . 1 B ) . Furthermore , the loop 541 – 545 ( S1 ) shows possible H bonds to AC3 . Fig . 6 A shows the major potential H bonds between S1 and AC3 . In addition , two lysines in the modeled loop 2 show possible interactions from Lys 640 ( S1 ) to Asp 25 ( AC3 ) and from Lys 642 ( S1 ) to Glu 334 ( AC3 ) . Loop 4 running from 366 to 377 in S1 in the form of a β - hairpin also shows a number of potential electro - static interactions with residues in AC3 . Fig . 6 B displays the con - tact area of AC3 and S1 with potential electrostatic interactions . The cardiomyopathy loop makes a direct electrostatic interac - tion via Glu 411 ( S1 ) to Lys 336 ( AC3 ) . Other hydrophobic inter - actions also occur . The critical Arg 405 Gln mutation ( identical with the Arg 403 Gln mutation in human cardiac myosin ) , which occurs in a severe familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and re - sults in a decreased actin - activated myosin ATPase ( 22 ) , is not in the interface : It faces away from actin . However , it may make a salt bridge with Glu 631 in the now structured part of loop 2 . Therefore , its affect on the actin - myosin association is probably via a stabilization of the folded conformation of loop 2 . Liu and co - workers ( 6 ) found in a MD simulation of the acto - S1 structure of Holmes et al . ( 2 ) that Lys 415 in S1 forms a stable H bond with Glu 334 in AC3 . In our refinement we did not find this salt bridge . However , the participating atoms are only 6 Å away from each other . Instead we found a H bond from Asn 410 of S1 to Tyr 337 in AC3 . They also found possible contacts of loop 4 to actin ( they called it “ C - Loop ” ) . Our results are in broad agreement with the findings of the earlier MD simulation ( 6 ) . Furthermore , Onishi et al . ( 23 ) performed mutations of three regions in heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) by phosphorylation of re - sidues 546 – 548 ( hydrophobic region ) , residues 407 and 409 and 412 – 414 in the cardiomyopathy loop , and finally residues 652 and 653 in loop 2 . They all have significantly lower actin - activated AT - Pase in HMM or even completely extinguish it . We found all those mutations in the contact surface of acto - S1 with possible contacts to actin residues ( see Table 2 ) . ContactsofS1withAC1 . S1 also makes significant contacts with AC1 ( see Fig . 1 A ) . Milligan ( 18 ) suggested that there might be an interaction between loop 3 ( 567 – 577 in S1 ) and actin . This was also suggested by Mornet et al . ( 15 ) by zero - cross - linking experiments . Furthermore , Blanchoin et al . ( 24 ) also favored the binding of S1 to two actin monomers in their kinetic studies .

The initial MD trajectory moved the DNase I binding loop away from the configuration given in 2ZWH to a configuration similar to that found in the crystal structure of the actin - DNase I complex 1ATN ( 21 ) . Replacing the DNase I binding loop in actin with the original loop from the crystal structure revealed an interaction of the DNase I binding loop with S1 . During the sub - sequent MD trajectory the crystal configuration was modified , but it retained the general shape of the DNase I binding loop . It showed strong interactions with S1 particularly through 44 – 49 ( AC1 ) with S1 543 – 554 ( S1 ) . We also found candidate H bonds between AC1 and S1 in the S1 helix 543 – 554 to the DNase I binding loop in actin and from loop 3 in S1 to residues Tyr 91 and Arg 95 in actin . Possible H bonds are shown in Fig . 8 A . Fig . 8 B shows the potential electrostatic interactions of AC1 with S1 . Lys 50 located in the DNase I binding loop in actin shows a weak interaction with Glu 576 from loop 3 in S1 . However , the major contacts are established by the Milligan contact from Glu 576 ( S1 ) to Arg 95 ( AC1 ) and Lys 569 ( S1 ) to Glu 99 ( AC1 ) . Table 2 shows all potential electrostatic interactions and poten - tial H bonds between AC1 and S1 and AC3 and S1 during the MDFF refinement . Discussion MDFF ( 5 ) trajectories run on an actin - myosin complex using the EM map at 13 - Å resolution ( 2 ) as a constraint showed the cleft - open weak - binding state ( myosin 2 postrigor ) changing into a structure verysimilartothecleft - closed strong - binding state ( myo - sin 5 rigor ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , the results showed that part of the disordered loop 2 was involved in the actin - myosin interface . The MDFF method in the unconstrained run showed that the actin binding cleft , which is open in myosin II , has to close into a myosin V - like structure in order to account for the strong - binding state . However , the procedure distorted some regions near the bound - aries of the map and a falloff of radial density in the EM map produceda force pushing allstructures1 – 2 Åtoward thehelix axis . Therefore details of the unconstrained run are uncertain and are notfurtherdiscussed . Inordertorectifythesedeficiencies , wetook as a starting structure a modified myosin 2 modeled on the crystal - lographic structure of myosin 5 . In addition , loop 2 in S1 and the DNase - bindingloopinactin ( AC1 ) wererebuiltasdescribedinthe text . For stability , harmonic constraints were applied to selected areas not involved in the interface . Three MDFF trajectories with varying starting parameters led to similar structures for the inter - face . The generated interface is extensive and stereochemically plausible . We found that myosin S1 interacts with two adjacent actin molecules . In addition to the established interactions between the lower 50 - K domain and actin described in ref . 4 , most of loop 2 is involved in establishing the association of S1 and AC3 . Furthermore , the cardiomyopathy loop participates in the acto - S1 interaction . We also found substantial contacts between AC1 and S1 . The DNase - binding loop showed strong contacts with S1 residues . Moreover , the MDFF refinement moved loop 3 toward the actin helix axis resulting in substantial support of an additional site predicted by Milligan ( 18 ) . Our results are also in good agreement with the findings by Liu and colleagues ( 6 ) . However , the contacts from loop 2 to actin differ as the part of loop 2 that makes contacts with AC3 in our acto - S1 structure was modeled in a different way to be buried in the actin - S1 contact surface . There is also a discrepancy of the buried solvent accessible surface area . Whereas in our structure the total contact surface of AC1 - S1 and AC3 - S1 is 1980 Å 2 , Liu and colleagues measure only 463 Å 2 . But they also favor loop 2 , loop 4 , and the cardiomyopathy loop in S1 as important segments to establish contacts with actin . Their MD simulations could not take account for the Milligan contact as shown in our acto - S1 structure that was driven by the map force during the MDFF refinement . The resulting acto - S1 model was achieved by using harmonic constraints in the regions of actin and S1 , which do not contribute to the acto - S1 and also actin - actin interface . The reason was that the resolution is too low to let all of the structure move in the molecular dynamics process using MDFF . However , it seems to be very likely that actin would not behave like a rigid body upon S1 binding , resulting in at least small movements of loops and segments in order to enhance the interface .

Further details would require higher resolution of the EM map . Our results reveal additional acto - S1 interactions that provide a plausible model for the strong - binding state of S1 to actin . Since the EM map has a resolution of only 13 Å , which is too low to show atomic structure , the details of the present model need to be refuted or substantiated by additional experiments . Fortunately , the additional potential contacts suggest numerous biochemical experiments . Materials and Methods MDFF ( 5 ) is a MD simulation with each atom being subjected to an additional force derived from the gradient of the EM density . The EM density map from Holmes ( 2 ) was used to provide the constraining force field . This procedure results in atoms being moved into higher density areas of the EM map . In addition , we added another energy term to preserve secondary structure elements as an option in MDFF . Thus the total energy function we used is U TOTAL ¼ U MD þ U EM þ U SS ; where U MD is the MD energy function , U EM is the energy function corre - sponding to a force derived from the gradient of the EM density , and U SS the energy function used to preserve the secondary structure elements . A scaling factor adjusted by trial and error was applied locally to U EM in order to avoid dominance of the force resulting from the EM density map . Calculations were carried out both in vacuum and in a water box in which the protein complex had been embedded . The box was set up to have per - iodic boundary conditions . The MD runs were carried out until the rmsd between therefined structures and theinitial coordinate set reached astable value . We carried out 12 MD runs in vacuum and 3 MD runs in a water box . Convergence was generally reached after 1 to 2 ns of simulation depending on the parameter settings . The following parameters were changed during the refinements : (cid:127) The map force scaling , varying between 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 , (cid:127) simulation using 2 actin monomers or 5 actin monomers , (cid:127) different start configurations of loop 2 , (cid:127) strength of constraints used to preserve secondary structure elements , (cid:127) harmonic constraints — applied to selected areas .
