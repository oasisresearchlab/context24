Correspondence to : Paolo Ruzza ; e - mail : paolo . ruzza @ unipd . it ABSTRACT : Cortactin is a ubiquitous actin - binding protein that regulates various aspects of cell dynamics and is implicated in the pathogenesis of human neoplasia . The sequence of cortactin contains a number of signaling motifs and an SH3 domain at the C - terminus , which mediates the interaction of the protein with several partners , including Shank2 . A recombinant protein , comprising the murine cortactin SH3 domain fused to GST ( GST - SH3 m - cort ) , was prepared and used to assess the domain - binding afﬁnity of potential peptide - ligands reproducing the proline - rich regions of human HPK1 and Shank2 proteins . The key residues involved in the SH3 m - cort domain recognition were identiﬁed by three different approaches : non - immobilized ligand interaction assay by circular dichroism , isothermal titration calorimetry , and nuclear magnetic resonance . Our results show that the classical PxxPxK class II binding motif is not sufﬁcient to mediate the interaction with GST - SH3 m - cort , an event that depends on the presence of additional basic residues located at either the N - or the C - terminus of the PxxPxK motif . Especially effective in promoting the peptide binding is a Lys residue at the - 5 position , a determinant present in both P2 ( HPK1 394 - 403 ) and S1 ( Shank2 1168 - 1189 ) peptides . GST - SH3 m - cort exhibits the highest afﬁnity toward peptide S1 , which contains additional Lys residues at the - 3 , - 5 , and - 7 positions , indicating that the optimal consensus motif may be KPPxPxKxKxK . These results are supported by the in silico models of SH3 m - cort complexed with P2 or S1 , which highlight the domain residues that interact with the recognition determinants of the peptide - ligand and cooperate in binding stabilization . # 2009 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .

Many regulated biochemical processes are initi - ated or inhibited through transiently - formed protein complexes , a notable number of which are mediated by the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain family of interaction modules . With a preference for binding proteins that contain speciﬁc proline - rich sequences , SH3 domains are single , non - catalytic protein modules of around 60 amino acids . Originally discovered in the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) product of the v - src oncogene , these domains are present in numerous proteins and enzymes . 1 , 2 The ability of SH3 domains to bind short , speciﬁc peptides with sequences enriched with Pro has led the majority of investigations to focus solely on these motifs ; this is due in large measure to the convenience of using peptides rather than intact pro - teins . As a result , the sequence homology among many pro - line - rich peptides is well established , 3 , 4 revealing that a PxxP core binding motif is almost always present in the cognate binding sites , generally ﬂanked by a basic residue . This conserved basic residue may be either N - or C - termi - nal to the PxxP sequence deﬁning ligands of class I , or II , respectively . 5 The crystal and solution structures of Src - related SH3 domains in complex with a Pro - rich peptide reveal that the peptide binding conformation is a left - handed polyproline type II ( PPII ) helix , and that two of the three edges of the helix interact with a set of conserved aro - matic residues at the SH3 binding interface . 6 , 7 Cortactin was initially identiﬁed as one of the most prom - inent tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in v - src - infected chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts . 8 Overexpression of cortactin fre - quently occurs in several human carcinomas 9 – 12 and corre - lates with lymph node metastasis and increased mortality . 13 – 15 Elevated expression of cortactin increases cell motility , inva - sion 16 – 18 and metastasis . 19 The deduced amino acid sequence of cortactin consists of three main distinguishable domains : the N - terminal acidic region which contains a DDW - Arp2 / 3 binding motif followed by six and one - half 37 - amino acids F - actin binding repeat domains ; a central portion ; and an SH3 domain at the C - terminus . This SH3 domain mediates the interaction of cortactin with several proteins , including Shank2 , also called CortBP1 ( Cortactin Binding Protein 1 ) , an adaptor protein playing a crucial role in neuronal growth cones . 20 – 22 Hashimoto et al . found that the SH3 domain of cortactin interacts also with AMAP1 proline - rich peptide , even if with atypical stoichiometry and interface structure . In fact , a single molecule of ligand binds to two molecules of the cortactin SH3 domain . 23 Cortactin shows the closest resemblance to the haemato - poietic lineage cell - speciﬁc protein 1 ( HS1 ) . The overall simi - larity at the amino acid level of the two proteins is 51 % , while the sequences corresponding to the SH3 and the F - actin binding domains of cortactin and HS1 reach a similar - ity of about 86 % . 24 Despite the high sequence homology , the distribution and function of cortactin and HS1 differ consid - erably . 25 Nagata et al . 26 found that HS1 is associated with the proline - rich region of the haematopoietic progenitor kinase - 1 ( HPK1 ) in haematopoietic cells through its C - terminal SH3 domain . HPK1 is a member of a family of mammalian Ste20 - related Ser / Thr protein kinases , which is widely expressed during embryogenic development and becomes re - stricted to haematopoietic organs and cells in adults . 27 – 29 The central region of HPK1 harbors four proline - rich motifs called P1 , P2 , P3 , and P4 ( Table I ) . For this investiga - tion , these Pro - rich peptides were synthesized together with the S1 peptide matching the sequence 1168 – 1189 of the Shank2 protein , which interacts with cortactin SH3 do - main . 21 , 22 We have also synthesized C1 and C2 peptides on the basis of the proposed consensus - binding motif for the cortactin SH3 domain , determined by a phage - displayed library encoding peptides of the form x 6 PxxPx 630 ( Table I ) . In this study , the interactions of the SH3 domain of mu - rine cortactin ( SH3 m - cort ) with the aforementioned Pro - rich peptides ( Table I ) are analyzed using three different analytical approaches : non - immobilized ligand interaction assay by CD spectroscopy ( NILIA - CD ) ; isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) ; and nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy . The observed K d values support the assignment of a new SH3 cort binding - motif , which contains a class II Pro - rich sequence ﬂanked by Lys residues located at speciﬁc positions of the peptide - ligand . METHODS Peptide Synthesis and Puriﬁcation Fmoc - protected amino acids and preloaded Wang or 2 - chlorotrityl resins were purchased from Calbiochem - Novabiochem ( La¨ufel - ﬁngen , Switzerland ) . HBTU , HOBt , DIEA and NMP were obtained from Applied Biosystems - Perkin Elmer ( Foster City , CA ) . Peptides were synthesized using an Advanced ChemTech ( Louisville , KY ) 348 O peptide synthesizer and the Fmoc / HBTU chemistry in a 0 . 05 mmol scale . Coupling yields were monitored on aliquots of peptide resin either by Kaiser test for the amino groups or by evaluation of Fmoc displacement . 31 Peptides were side chain - deprotected and removed from the resin by TFA treatment in the presence of 2 . 5 % TIS , 2 . 0 % anisole and 0 . 5 % water , and then precipitated by addition of diethyl ether . Crude peptides were puriﬁed by preparative reversed - phase HPLC using a Shimadzu LC - 8 ( Shimazdu , Kyoto , Japan ) system Atypical Cortactin SH3 Domain Ligand 299 Biopolymers ( Peptide Science ) with a Vydac 218TP1022 , 10 l , 250 3 22 mm column ( Grace Davi - son Discovery Sciences , Deerﬁeld , IL ) . The column was perfused at a ﬂow rate of 12 mL / min with a mobile phase containing solvent A ( 0 . 05 % TFA in water ) and a linear gradient from 10 – 30 % of solvent B ( 0 . 05 % TFA in acetonitrile / water , 9 : 1 by vol . ) in 40 min . The frac - tions containing the desired product were collected and lyophilized to constant weight in the presence of 0 . 01 N HCl . Analytical HPLC analyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC - 10 instrument ﬁtted with a Jupiter C18 , 10 l , 250 3 4 . 6 mm column ( Phenomenex , Tor - rance , CA ) using the described solvent system ( solvents A and B ) , with a ﬂow rate of 1 mL / min , and detection at 216 nm . All peptides showed less than 1 % impurities . Molecular weights of compounds were determined by ESI - MS on a Mariner ( PerSeptive Biosystem , Foster City , CA ) mass spectrometer instrument . The mass was assigned using a mixture of neurotensin , angiotensin and bradyki - nin , at a concentration of 1 pmol / l L , as external standard . The amino acid compositions of the peptide acid hydrolysates ( 6 M HCl , 22 h at 110 8 C in sealed evacuated vials ) were determined with a Carlo Erba 3A30 ( Milan , Italy ) amino acid analyzer . Expression and Puriﬁcation of the SH3 m - cort Domain The expression construct containing the SH3 domain of murine cortactin ( sequence 491 - 546 ) fused to glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) was kindly provided by Sheila M . Thomas ( Cancer Biology Program , BIH / Harvard Medical School ) . GST - SH3 m - cort was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 from a pGEX - 4T1 plasmid . The cells harboring pGEX - 4T1 were grown at 37 8 C to an optical density of OD 600 ¼ 0 . 6 , and expression was induced by adding 1 m M isopropyl - 1 - thio - b - D - galactoside ( IPTG ) followed by incubation at 37 8 C with constant shaking at 180 rev / min for 4 h . The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 140 m M NaCl , 2 . 7 m M KCl , 10 m M Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 m M KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 0 ) and lysed by two pas - sages through a French pressure cell at 18 , 000 lb / in . 2 Crude extracts were then cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 10 , 000g for 10 min . The supernatant was mixed with Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) and incubated for 2 h at 4 8 C in a rotator at 20 rev / min . After washing with lysis buffer , GST - SH3 was eluted with a 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 buffer contain - ing 10 m M reduced glutathione . The eluate was collected and con - centrated with an Amicon Ultra - 10 ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . The GST - SH3 domain concentration was determined by absorption spectroscopy ( e ¼ 57 , 420 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 at 280 nm ) . The SH3 domain was cleaved from GST - SH3 on glutathione - Sepharose beads using thrombin ( 0 . 1 U per 1 mg of protein ) at 20 8 C for 14 h , and the excess thrombin was removed using benza - midine Sepharose 6B ( Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) . The elu - ate was collected and concentrated with an Amicon Ultra - 10 ( Milli - pore ) . The SH3 domain concentration was determined by absorp - tion spectroscopy ( e ¼ 16 , 960 M (cid:1) 1 cm (cid:1) 1 at 280 nm ) . For NMR studies , uniformly 15 N - labeled GST - SH3 m - cort protein was expressed in BL21 , grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g / L of 15 NH 4 Cl , and induced with IPTG . Cells were grown and lysed as before . Crude extracts were centrifuged at 10 , 000g for 10 min , and the supernatant was mixed with glutathione Sepharose 4B resin . After washing with lysis buffer , the 15 N - labeled SH3 m - cort domain was cleaved from GST as described above . The domain was brought to 20 m M phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 5 , and the ﬁnal protein concen - trations of the sealed NMR samples were about 1 m M . Circular Dichroism All measurements were performed using a nitrogen - ﬂushed Jasco J - 715 spectropolarimeter ( Tokyo , Japan ) using either a 0 . 5 - cm or a 1 . 0 - cm quartz cell for the near - UV region and a 0 . 1 - cm quartz cell for the far - UV region . The CD spectra were recorded using a band - width of 2 nm , a scan speed of 20 nm / min , a time constant of 4 sec and 6 accumulation scans . Each titration was performed in aqueous buffer ( 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 ) at room temperature by addition of small aliquots of peptide stock solution in the same buffer as described in Siligardi et al . 32 Peptide concentration was determined by weight using a Mettler Toledo microbalance ( Columbus , OH ) model AT21 Com - parator ( sensitivity 6 1 l g ) .

Biopolymers ( Peptide Science ) peptide / GST - SH3 complexes were determined by analyzing the CD data at a single wavelength by nonlinear regression analysis as previ - ously described . 32 Far - UV CD spectra of proline - rich peptides were obtained in aqueous buffer ( 20 m M Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 ) at room temperature and at 5 8 C . Isothermal Titration Calorimetry ITC studies were performed with GST - SH3 m - cort fusion protein on a VP - ITC calorimeter ( MicroCal Inc . , Northampton , MA ) . Recombi - nant GST - SH3 protein samples were extensively dialyzed in 20 m M Tris - HCl buffer , pH 7 . 5 , and peptides were dissolved in the same ﬁnal dialysis buffer . The pH value of the peptide sample was brought to the same value as that of the protein sample ( allowed difference < 0 . 02 units ) . Before each titration experiment , the GST - SH3 protein ( 2 mL ) and peptide ( 600 l L ) samples were degassed for 30 min under vacuum , without stirring , at a temperature a few degrees below that of the experiment . The GST - SH3 protein sample ( 50 – 90 l M ) was loaded carefully ( to prevent the introduction of air bubbles ) into the 1 . 4 mL sample cell . The peptide sample ( 0 . 8 – 1 . 2 m M ) was placed in the injection syringe . Each experiment was con - ducted with 30 injections , beginning with a single 1 l L injection ( 2 sec ) , and the remaining ones of 10 l L each . The spacing between injections was 180 sec . The reference power was 10 l cal / sec and the initial delay was 1 min . The experiment was conducted at 25 8 C with a stirring speed of 270 rpm . The data from the experiment was collected and analyzed with the software ORIGIN ( version 5 . 0 , MicroCal Inc . ) . Thermodynamic parameters were determined by nonlinear least squares ﬁtting for the ‘‘one set of binding sites’’ model , following ORIGIN recommendations . NMR Spectroscopy Uniformly 15 N - labeled SH3 m - cort domain protein samples for NMR were prepared in 20 m M phosphate buffer at pH 7 . 5 with 10 % of D 2 O . NMR experiments were collected at 25 8 C on a Bruker Avance 600 ( Bruker BioSpin GmbH , Rheinstetten , Germany ) spectrometer equipped with a gradient triple resonance probe . The following 2D and 3D heteronuclear spectra were acquired to assign the 1 H - 15 N - HSQC spectra used for binding studies . A 3D - 15 N - HSQC - NOESY experiment ( 100 ms mixing time ) was acquired with spectral windows ( and number of complex points ) of 3005 Hz ( 512 ) , 7184 Hz ( 160 ) , and 2189 Hz ( 64 ) in the 1 H ( direct ) , 1 H ( indirect ) , and 15 N dimensions , respectively . Additional 2D - 15 N - HSQC - TOCSY ( 75 ms mixing time ) , and 2D - 15 N - HSQC - NOESY ( 100 ms mixing time ) spectra were collected using spectral windows ( and number of complex points ) of 7184 Hz ( 512 ) and 2189 Hz ( 256 ) , in the 1 H and 15 N dimensions , respectively . For the titration , a series of 2D - 1 H - 15 N - HSQC spectra were recorded with the pulse sequence proposed by Mori et al . 33 Each of these experiments was acquired with 256 increments of 512 time points each and with spectral windows of 3005 Hz and 2189 Hz in the 1 H and 15 N dimensions , respectively . After every step in the ti - tration , peaks in the HSQC spectrum were analyzed for changes in chemical shift . The proton carrier was set to the water frequency for the two - dimensional HSQC - TOCSY and HSQC - NOESY , while it was set to 8 . 5 ppm for the 3D experiment and for the HSQC spectra ; the 15 N carrier was set to 119 ppm for all experiments . The 3D spectrum was processed and analyzed using the software package nmrPipe , 34 whereas all 2D spectra were processed using Bruker XWINNMR software and analyzed using the software NMR Sparky . 35 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Analysis of the Binding Afﬁnity Displayed by the Pro - Rich Peptides for the SH3 m - cort Domain CD spectroscopy provides a useful and simple method to screen the capability of the synthetic peptides ( Table I ) to interact with the SH3 domain of murine cortactin . These binding studies were performed with recombinant GST - SH3 m - cort fusion protein using the near - UV NILIA - CD tech - nique . Indeed , the region of the SH3 domains involved in the interaction with the proline - rich core of the ligands is a sur - face patch formed by the side chains of a few well - conserved aromatic residues , which are excellent in situ molecular probes of protein - peptide interaction . Actually , the binding of the synthetic peptides to GST - SH3 m - cort domain can be clearly determined by the spectral changes of the two strong features of Trp residue at approximately 290 and 295 nm ( Figure 1 , panel A ) . The values of the apparent dissociation constant K d can be determined by non - linear regression anal - ysis of the D A values at 295 nm obtained at different SH3 / peptide ratios ( Figure 1 , panel B , and Table I ) . Control titrations performed with recombinant GST dem - onstrated that the protein does not interact with the Pro - rich peptides , ruling out the hypothesis that the GST portion of the fusion protein GST - SH3 m - cort might affect the binding afﬁnity to the peptide - ligands ( data not shown ) . Moreover , since GST protein might undergo dimerization , 36 parallel titrations were performed using free SH3 m - cort domain and either P2 or S1 peptide ( Figure 1 , panel C and D ) . The K d values determined with either GST - SH3 m - cort or SH3 m - cort were very similar : 0 . 9 and 1 . 1 l M , respectively , with P2 , and 0 . 5 and 0 . 3 l M with S1 . These results support the validity of using the recombinant fusion protein instead of the free SH3 m - cort domain in CD spectroscopy analysis . As expected , peptide P3 , which ﬁts poorly within the classi - cal SH3 domain binding consensus motifs , is unable to interact with GST - SH3 m - cort domain ( Table I ) . Surprisingly , the typical class II motif PxxPxK ( peptide P2a ) is also insufﬁcient to pro - mote an interaction with the domain , while the replacement of the proline at the 3 position with a basic residue ( peptides C1 and C2 ) induces the ability of peptides C1 and C2 to interact with the SH3 m - cort domain ( K d ¼ 12 and 41 l M , respectively ) ( Table I ) . Therefore , the C1 and C2 peptides , which match the SH3 cort consensus binding - motif determined by a phage - dis - played library , + PP § PxKP ( where + and § are basic and hydro - Atypical Cortactin SH3 Domain Ligand 301 Biopolymers ( Peptide Science ) phobic residues , respectively ) , 30 contain the minimum require - ment for binding to SH3 m - cort domain . GST - SH3 m - cort binds with the highest afﬁnity to peptides P2 ( K d ¼ 0 . 9 l M ) and S1 ( K d ¼ 0 . 5 l M ) , which reproduce the sequence 394 – 403 of HPK1 and 1168 – 1189 of Shank2 , respectively . Peculiar features of both P2 and S1 peptides , which belong to the class II of the SH3 ligands , are the pres - ence of ( i ) a Lys residue instead of the more common argi - nine at the - 3 position and ( ii ) additional Lys residues located outside the classical PxxPxK binding motif ( Table I ) . The replacement of lysine residues at positions - 3 and - 5 of the P2 sequence by arginines ( see peptide P1 ) leads to a twelve - fold reduction in the afﬁnity for GST - SH3 m - cort ( Table I ) suggesting the presence of a Lys - speciﬁc binding site in the SH3 m - cort domain . The capability of distinguishing between Arg and Lys , ﬁrst described in the c - Crk N - terminal SH3 do - main , 37 is rare in protein interactions , and confers additional selectivity to the molecular recruitment mediated by the SH3 m - cort domain . A similar property was displayed by HS1 SH3 domain as demonstrated by its binding afﬁnities with the HPK1 P1 and P2 peptides or the P2 - derivatives Arg 5 P2 , Arg 7 P2 , and Arg 5 , 7 P2 ( unpublished data ) . The binding afﬁnity of the peptide P4 ( HPK1468 - 477 ) to the GST - SH3 m - cort domain ( K d ¼ 33 l M ) is consistent with the K d values determined by Lewitzky et al . 38 for the sequence HPK1459 - 484 interacting with the Grb2 - related Mona / Gads / Grap2 SH3 domain ( K d * 22 l M ) , which is highly homologous to SH3 m - cort domain . This evidence prompted us to reconsider the length of P4 , and therefore the P4a derivative was synthesized ( Table I ) , where the native Met - 7 was replaced by the isosteric Nle to avoid the potential decrease of the peptide bioactivity due to the methionine ox - idation . 39 , 40 This elongation promotes an increase of about 2 . 5 - fold in the ligand binding afﬁnity ( Table II ) , likely ascrib - able to the presence of two additional Lys residues at the - 6 and - 8 positions . The ﬁnding that the binding afﬁnity of P4a is about 15 - fold lower than that of P2 and S1 , supports the crucial role of the Lys residue at the - 5 position . To conﬁrm the NILIA - CD results , the thermodynamic parameters for the binding of recombinant GST - SH3 m - cort FIGURE 1 Near - UV CD titration of the HPK1 - derived peptide P2 versus GST - SH3 m - cort fusion protein ( panel A ) or free SH3 m - cort domain ( panel C ) and corresponding binding curves ( panels B and D ) . The analysis was performed in Tris - HCl buffer solution , pH 7 . 5 , at room temperature . The CD changes , observed in the near - UV region ( 265 – 350 nm ) upon addition of HPK1 Pro - rich pep - tide to either GST - SH3 m - cort ( 46 . 5 l M ) or free SH3 m - cort domain ( 108 . 3 l M ) , are due to the pertur - bation of the local tertiary structure of the SH3 Tyr ( about 270 nm ) and Trp ( about 295 nm ) aro - matic side chain residues . The D A values were measured as a function of the indicated SH3 / peptide molar ratios . 302 Rubini et al . Biopolymers ( Peptide Science ) protein with peptides P2 , P4 , P4a , and S1 were determined using ITC analysis . From a single binding isotherm the en - thalpy ( D H ) , entropy ( D S ) , and the free energy ( D G ) changes , and stoichiometry ( n ) of the binding reaction can be obtained ( Table II ) . The range of the experimentally observed free energy of binding to the GST - SH3 m - cort fusion protein is comparable to that obtained for the binding of sev - eral peptide - SH3 systems , such as the human homologue Grb2 SH3N domain to mSos , 41 c - Src SH3 domain to RLP2 peptide , 42 Sem - 5 SH3C domain to Sos peptide , 43 and Fyn SH3 domain to P2l peptide , 44 as a further conﬁrmation of the absence of undesired effects related to the use of the GST fusion protein . The K d values obtained range from 140 n M ( S1 ) to 64 l M ( P4 ) ( Table II ) . The trend of binding afﬁnity determined by ITC is in general agreement with that observed with NILIA - CD experiments ; such correspondence would indicate that both techniques are monitoring the same process . Consider - ing how signiﬁcantly different the CD versus ITC methods are , and how they can be affected to different degrees by dif - ferent factors , our data sets do actually demonstrate a very reasonable correlation as shown by plotting the K d ( CD ) ver - sus the K d ( ITC ) ( Supporting Information , Figure 1S ) . The ITC measurements reveal that the change in entropy upon association with the SH3 m - cort domain is a major driv - ing force for almost all the examined peptides . With respect to entropy , however , ITC measures global thermodynamic parameters ( a formulaic deconstruction is presented by Stur - tevant 45 ) , and what is ultimately determined is the total change in entropy of the system as a whole ( D S tot ) . The con - tribution of enthalpy is evident in the drop in binding afﬁn - ity from P2 ( K d ¼ 1 . 4 l M ) to P4 ( K d ¼ 64 l M ) . This may be consistent with the loss of van der Waals - type interactions through proline , since P4 has only four such residues , while P2 has six . The absence of a signiﬁcant entropy change in this case suggests that P4 still retains the helical conforma - tion as P2 , a speculation conﬁrmed by the far - UV CD studies ( Supporting Information , Figure 2S ) . Alternatively , the release of associated water upon binding is not notably dif - ferent between the two peptides ( Table II ) . P4 elongation has a favorable effect on the entropic contribution to the free energy of binding , and the magnitude of the T D S of binding for the P4a peptide is large enough to offset the losses in D H observed for P4 . The binding constant of P4a obtained by ITC supports the CD measurements ( Table I ) and suggests an even more positive effect of the P4 elongation . Peptide S1 displays an unpredicted thermodynamic behavior . This peptide , which interacts with the highest bind - ing afﬁnity ( K d ¼ 0 . 14 l M ) , possesses a signiﬁcant entropic driving force ( T D S ¼ 7 . 2 kcal mol (cid:1) 1 ) , whereas it is character - ized by the lowest D H of binding . The absence of some level of preorganized structure in solution of the free peptide S1 ( Figure 2S ) suggests that the peptide engages in enhanced hydrophobic interactions , culminating in entropically favor - able release of water upon binding . Mapping of the Peptide - Binding Region of the SH3 m - cort Domain Chemical shift perturbation mapping was then used to iden - tify the peptide binding interface of the SH3 m - cort domain . The experiment consists of a stepwise addition of ligand onto the protein sample monitoring the chemical shifts of the backbone amide resonances ( 1 H N and 15 N ) of the pro - tein . Firstly , the backbone amide resonances in 20 m M phos - phate buffer , pH 7 . 5 , for the free SH3 m - cort domain were assigned using 2D - 15 N - HSQC - TOCSY , 2D - 15 N - HSQC - NOESY , and 3D - 15 N - HSQC - NOESY experiments ( Sup - porting Information , Table S1 ) . The SH3 m - cort assignments are in general agreement with those reported for the SH3 do - main of the human cortactin , 23 which differs only for the presence of V494 instead of I494 present in the murine do - main . The residues at the extreme N - terminus ( before resi - due A493 ) could not be assigned . Mapping total chemical shift changes in the presence of either the P2 or the S1 peptide - ligand ( Figure 2 , panel A ) onto SH3 m - cort structure revealed that the majority of the res - idues displaying changes in the amide chemical shifts are at or near the domain - ligand interface ( Figure 2 , panels B and C ) . However , the ﬁnding that Q500 , A501 , D504 , I507 , S508 , F509 , D510 , and F537 are remote from the bound ligand sug - gests the presence of long - range effects .

In the n - Src loop , changes are observed for W525 ( for this resi - due , only a large total chemical shift for the indole resonance was observed ) , which directly interacts with the ligand , and E519 , M520 , I521 , and E522 , located at the base of the loop . It is possible that ligand - induced restrictions of W525 may alter amide resonances of residues positioned directly across the loop , as well as of residues hydrogen - bonded across the loop . Similarly , correlated changes in amide chemical shifts are observed in the RT loop , where the side chain carboxyl groups of D515 and E516 are involved in salt bridges with the side chains of Lys residues . On the other hand , the FIGURE 2 Differences in chemical shifts for each SH3 m - cort residue between free and complexed state .

The solid circles show the residues of the ligand PxxPxK motif and their inter - acting amino acids belonging to the SH3 m - cort domain : Pro 2 - Y541 ( A ) , Pro 1 - N540 ( B ) , Pro - 1 - W525 ( C ) and Lys - 3 - D505 / E506 ( D ) . The dashed circles indicate other essential interactions between the cati - onic side chain of the Lys - 5 residue of either P2 or S1 peptide and the anionic side chain of the domain D505 residue ( E ) . Other inter - actions involving the S1 peptide ( panel B ) are Lys - 7 - D522 ( F ) and Lys 3 - D498 ( G ) .

Biopolymers ( Peptide Science ) ligand - induced changes in the amide chemical shifts of A501 , I507 , S508 , and F509 residues , belonging to the RT loop and not directly involved in the binding , indicate that the binding process is coupled to a conformational change in the RT loop . 46 Finally , residues F537 and N540 are located in the 3 10 - helix . Role of Lys Residues in the Interaction Between the Peptide - Ligand and the SH3 m - cort Domain In silico models of SH3 m - cort in complex with peptide - ligands were built using the crystal structure of human cortactin SH3 domain bound to AMAP1 proline - rich peptide , 23 even if this interaction is unique in its atypical binding stoichiometry and manner of ligand interaction . Indeed , the AMAP1 pro - line - rich peptide binds to two molecules of the cortactin SH3 domain , as conﬁrmed by crystal structure and size exclusion chromatography . The peptide acts as a class I ligand in its binding to one SH3 domain , and as a class II ligand in the binding to the other domain . The models of the domain interacting with either peptide P2 ( Figure 3A ) or S1 ( Figure 3B ) further support our experi - mental data . Speciﬁcally , Figure 3 shows that the PP II confor - mation of the class II binding motif ( PxxPxK ) provides a ‘‘semi - rigid’’ template , enabling hydrogen - bonding between the accessible peptide amide carbonyl groups and the SH3 Y541 phenolic hydroxyl group , the W525 indolic amino group , and the side chain amide group of N540 . Other inter - actions involve the long cationic side chain of Lys - 3 and the anionic side chain residues of the SH3 domain D505 and E506 . In addition , the side chain of Lys - 5 can form a salt bridge with the side chain of D505 of the SH3 domain that is needed to assist and maintain the binding . These results are bolstered by the large value for the chemical shift change found for D505 and E506 and summarized in Figure 3 . Figure 3 also highlights contacts , speciﬁc for the S1 peptide ( panel B ) , that occur between the side chains of the Lys resi - dues at the 3 and - 7 positions with the side chains of D498 and D522 of the SH3 domain , respectively . This ﬁnding supports the thermodynamic data , which indicate that S1 binds to SH3 m - cort with an afﬁnity higher than that displayed by the P2 peptide . Speciﬁcally , the interaction involving the ligand Lys 3 , also present in the computational models relative to peptides C1 and C2 ( data not shown ) , explains the different behavior of P2a peptide with respect to peptides C1 and C2 . CONCLUSIONS We determined the binding afﬁnities and the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction occurring between the SH3 do - main of murine cortactin and the peptide - ligands derived from the proline - rich region of HPK1 and Shank2 . In addi - tion , the SH3 m - cort chemical shift perturbation induced by the ligand binding was mapped , and the in silico models of the peptide / domain complexes were obtained . We found that the SH3 m - cort domain strongly interacts with peptide S1 ( K d ¼ 0 . 5 l M ) , which reproduces the sequence 1168 - 1189 of Shank2 , a natural cortactin - binding protein 21 and with peptide P2 ( K d ¼ 0 . 9 l M ) , which matches the sequence 394 - 403 of HPK1 kinase . Taken together , our data provide evidence that the SH3 m - cort domain does not interact with peptides containing the classical class II binding motif , but recognizes proline - rich sequences , which contain addi - tional basic residues , Lys being a better determinant than Arg , either N - or C - terminal of the PxxPxK core . The presence of a Lys at the - 5 position of the peptide - ligand is especially effective in promoting the binding to the SH3 m - cort domain . It has been recently proposed that the SH3 domains , which bind to extended proline - rich sequences , are charac - terized by the presence of two distinct surfaces : one interact - ing with the PxxP motif and the other mediating the binding with the residues ﬂaking the consensus motif , named Surface I and Surface II , respectively . 47 Residues located in the n - Src loop belong to Surface II in all the structure examined by the FIGURE 4 Alignment of different SH3 domains , which bind to extended peptide sequences . The sequence alignment was constructed in ClustalW ( http : / / www . uniprot . org ) . According to Ref . 47 , Surface I positions , which contact the PxxP region of peptides ( positions P - 2 to P 3 ) are colored red , and Surface II positions , which contact position P - 3 and ﬂanking residues , are colored blue . Posi - tions contacting both the PxxP regions of peptides and other parts are colored green . Note that the Gads SH3 domain binds to PxxP - containing peptides and to peptides lacking this motif .

The comparison with the sequences of other domains interacting with extended peptides ( Figure 4 ) sug - gests that also the binding site of the SH3 m - cort domain can be viewed as having two distinct surfaces . In fact , the bulk of information deduced from the NMR analysis and the in sil - ico modeling of the peptide / domain complexes highlights that the SH3 m - cort residues interacting with the ligand - pep - tide are located in positions corresponding to both surfaces .
