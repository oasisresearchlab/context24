All rights reserved Abstract The mainstream treatments for non - melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) include photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , surgery excision ( SE ) , cryotherapy ( CT ) , imiquimod ( IM ) , radiotherapy ( RT ) , 5 - fluorouracil ( FU ) and vehicle ( VE ) . Our network meta - analysis ( NMA ) was aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of these seven treatments and providing superior ones . After searching the trials from Embase and PubMed and screening with our criteria , we conducted the NMA with software R 3 . 2 . 3 and STATA 13 . 0 . Complete lesion response ( CLR ) , complete lesion clearance ( CLC ) , cumulative recurrence probabilities ( CRP ) and adverse effects ( AEs ) were considered as outcomes and displayed as odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % credible intervals ( CrI ) . The surface under the cumulative ranking curve ( SUCRA ) was calculated to rank each treatment on each index . The consistency of direct and indirect evidence was also assessed by node - splitting and heat plot methods . Data from 18 trials with 3 , 706 patients were included . Both IM and SE were demonstrated significantly higher CLR rate than VE ( OR = 9 . 12 , 95 % CrI = 1 . 92 - 47 . 5 ; OR = 26 . 1 , 95 % CrI = 1 . 92 - 347 ; respectively ) , while only IM was proved to be statistically better than VE in CLC rate ( OR = 7 . 03 , 95 % CrI = 1 . 51 - 32 . 8 ) . No significant difference was observed concerning CRP , and IM was more likely to induce AEs than VE ( OR = 4 . 44 , 95 % CrI = 1 . 58 - 13 . 9 ) . The SUCRA results indicated that SE was the treatment with best ranking in the entire three efficacy indexes and a relatively high safety . Taking efficacy and safety into account , our study recommended SE as the optimal regimen for NMSC with high efficacy considering CLR , CLC and CRP and moderate AEs when compared with other interventions .

All rights reserved Introduction Skin cancers , primarily induced by sunlight and UV radiation [ Bath - Hextall et al . , 2007b ] , are cancers located in the skin and developed with the progression of abnormal cells invading or spreading to other parts of the body . Non - melanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) is mainly used to define basal - cell carcinomas ( BCC ) and squamous - cell carcinomas ( SCC ) , in contrast to melanoma [ 2002 ] . Among three types of skin cancers , BCC and SCC are more frequently seen in the population . It is reported that BCC occupies up to 30 % of the white people in their lifetimes [ Wong et al . , 2003 ] , making it the most common cutaneous lesion classification and its incidence has been remarkably increasing 3 to 10 % annually [ de Vries et al . , 2005 ; Holterhues et al . , 2010 ; Roewert - Huber et al . , 2007 ] . SCC , including the Bowen’s disease ( BD ) , is another common type of skin cancer with a continuously rising trend across the world . In the USA , 180 , 000 to 400 , 000 cases of SCC happened in 2013 [ Karia et al . , 2013 ] . It should be noted that the elderly group often accounts for the majority of the patient population , however , in recent years , as a consequence of entertaining sun exposure and tanning beds , a larger number of youth tend to develop NMSC [ Bath - Hextall et al . , 2007a ; Birch - Johansen et al . , 2010 ] . It is often presented as translucency to fleshy color vessels in BCC and a red , crusted or scaly patch in SCC , and could cause cosmetic influence as well as has a certain degree of metastatic risk , especially the SCC subgroup [ Vasconcelos et al . , 2014 ] . Therefore , it is very urgent and essential to offer an ideal treatment for NMSC . Due to the obvious treatment type deviation of the melanomas from other skin cancers , this study mainly focused on the treatments of NMSC . Up to now , there have been a range of intervention options to treat NMSC and surgical excision ( SE ) is the most prevalent one . SE practice often involves different margins from the clinical estimated edge of the lesion , from 1mm to 5mm [ Wheatley et al . , 2016 ] . In addition , topical This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved therapies , including 5 - fluorouracil ( FU ) and imiquimod ( IM ) cream , are two main medical treatments for skin cancer . FU realizes the function of injuring cells by inhibiting the DNA synthesis owing to its ability of competitively repressing thymidylate synthetase and incorporating into RNA and DNA [ Bath - Hextall et al . , 2013 ] . As to IM , it works as an immune - response modifier to promote the cellular immune response . Other treatment regimens are destructive ones like cryotherapy ( CT ) and radiotherapy ( RT ) . Cryotherapy uses the low temperatures to destroy abnormal or diseased tissue , thus treating various kinds of benign and malignant tissue damage or lesions . The cell - destroying function of radiotherapy is based on the high - energy X - rays . In addition , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is a form of tumor intervention that uses the phototoxicity to kill the cells on the basis of light and a photosensitizing chemical substance [ Saini et al . , 2016 ] . However , all of the above available treatments are associated with different degrees of scarring , tissue defects and pigmentation change [ Telfer et al . , 1999 ] . Apart from the effectiveness evaluation of these treatments , safety factors should also be taken into consideration . For instance , in patients went through PDT section , moderate to severe burning sensation and pain were reported most often ; local swelling , itching , erosion , crust formation of skin often occurred in patients treated with creams ; and local skin redness was most common side effect in almost all treatment groups . Therefore when we try to screen out the most suitable intervention the balance between fewer negative effects and higher efficacy should be taken into consideration . A MA study on the treating of BD demonstrated that there existed a significant higher clearance rate of lesions when PDT was applied as the NMSC treatment compared with CT ( risk ratio ( RR ) 1 . 17 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1 . 01 - 1 . 37 ; n = 215 ) [ Morton et al . , 1996 ] but showed no obvious superiority over FU [ Bath - Hextall et al . , 2013 ] . Yet , in other studies [ Roozeboom et al . , 2012 ; Wang et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ] , PDT was believed to possess similar long - term efficacy This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved concerning BCC when compared with CT , IM or FU . The standard treatment in NMSC still goes to SE , which showed statistically higher complete lesion response or clearance and lower recurrence rate than PDT . The 4 - year failure rate ( 95 % CI ) was 0 . 7 % ( 0 . 1 - 3 . 9 % ) for SE but 7 . 5 % ( 4 . 2 - 13 . 1 % ) for RT ( log - rank P = 0 . 003 ) with respect to skin BCC [ Wang et al . , 2015 ] . Nevertheless , its safety and cosmetic effects could not be neglected . No systematic reviews or MA have been carried out with special attention to the safety of the various NMSC treatments , possibly due to the lack of enough safety data . Thus , the current evidence could not provide a substantial and firm suggestion on which regimen is superior concerning NMSC treating . In this study , we applied the network meta - analysis ( NMA ) method , which is also referred to as multiple treatment comparisons . By this means , we could gather the information of the current different treatments together and make comparisons between treatments with the direct and indirect evidence calculated via the Bayesian model . Its utility and value has been acknowledged widely [ Khera et al . , 2016 ; Palmer et al . , 2016 ; Samara et al . , 2016 ] . By examining outcomes of complete lesion response ( CLR ) , complete lesion clearance ( CLC ) , cumulative recurrence probabilities ( CRP ) and adverse effects ( AEs ) , this NMA is aimed to provide superior treatments for NMSC . It should be noted that this study is the first NMA study to conduct relevant NMSC treatment assessment and might work as a basis and reference for the future clinical practice . Methods Literature Search In order to carry out the NMA for the treatments of NMSC including BCC , SCC and BD , a This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved full - scale of literature search was conducted by retrieving relevant publications from the sources of medical databases including PubMed and Embase . The MeSH terms and related synonyms including " skin neoplasms " , " photodynamic therapy " , " surgery excision " , " 5 - fluorouracil " , " imiquimod " , " cryotherapy " , " radiotherapy " , etc . were combined in the search strategy . After importing the associated publications into the endnote library , the eligibility of these publications was carefully examined . Duplicates were removed and publications that had irrelevant title and abstract , outcomes as well as insufficient information were also discarded . The remaining ones were further allowed for full length articles retrieving . Inclusion Criteria In general , the qualified trials had to fulfill the following criteria : ( 1 ) enrolled studies should be at least two - arm studies or meta - analysis studies which target at the treatment of NMSC ; ( 2 ) necessary information such as treatments and outcomes of patients was sufficient ; ( 3 ) At least one of the mainstream treatment types ( PDT , SE , CT , IM , RT , FU with VE as the control group ) should be included ; ( 4 ) clinical outcomes of trials included at least one of our outcomes ( CLR , CLC , CRP , AEs ) . Data Extraction Outcome information from qualified RCTs or prospective studies and related MA were both examined and extracted . Captured data mainly consisted of study characteristics ( author , year , study design , blinding method , tumor features , follow - up duration , patients’ information and intervention types ) and all - relevant outcomes . The CLR refers to the proportion of lesions that disappear or maintain normal tumor marker level for at least 4 weeks . CLC is related to the complete histologic clearing of their target tumors at the post treatment biopsy for at least 4 weeks . CRP is the cumulative probability for tumor to become active again and the time could vary from 1 year to 5 This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved years . AEs in this study contain all observed adverse effects . All reports were further examined by two experts separately . Divergences were resolved by joint discussion until a final consensus was reached . Our analysis was restricted to endpoints of efficacy and safety . Data Manipulation & Statistical Analysis On the basis of a rigorous review of the authenticity and accuracy of the extracted data , data was merged and sorted before being statistically analyzed and transformed into plots . R 3 . 2 . 3 and STATA 13 . 0 were used to complete this work . Data pairing and pre - processing were achieved by STATA . Network plots were constructed by showing both treatment sample size and the count of direct comparison study between every two interventions . In this NMA study targeting NMSC , direct and indirect evidence concerning different NMSC treatments were also combined using Bayesian framework model . Due to the binary characteristics of the extracted outcomes , the evidence was displayed as OR and 95 % CrI , which is illustrated in the relative effect table and node - splitting plots . The random - effects model was utilized in this study to calculate the evidence inconsistency since it was believed to be the most suitable and conservative method to speculate heterogeneity of various trials within each intervention comparison . The heat plots are visualized formats which show the overall inconsistency among various groups of comparison considering both the direct and indirect evidences . The relative ranking of different NMSC treatments concerning four core outcomes ( CLR , CLC , CRP and AEs ) was presented as the SUCRA probabilities . In this study , we further transformed SUCRA values into the visualized cluster plots with the aim of obtaining a more intuitional view of the superiority positions of various treatments . In addition , publication bias was evaluated via observing the symmetry characteristics of funnel - plots . A symmetrical and concentrated distribution of dots indicates no obvious deviation .

Briefly , a total of 2107 potential publications were obtained from the literature search in the databases . After a removal of 529 duplicates , there remained a record of 1578 studies . With the check of the relevance of title , abstract , outcomes as well as information sufficiency , we finally took 18 trials with 3706 patients into NMA manipulation . Overall , the 18 included studies were published from 1986 to 2015 , with 3 prospective studies and 15 randomized controlled trials ( RCT ) studies [ Arits et al . , 2013 ; Avril et al . , 1997 ; Basset - Seguin et al . , 2008 ; Bath - Hextall et al . , 2014 ; Beutner et al . , 1999 ; Geisse et al . , 2004 ; Geisse et al . , 2002 ; Hall et al . , 1986 ; Morton et al . , 2006 ; Morton et al . , 1996 ; Rhodes et al . , 2004 ; Roozeboom et al . , 2013 ; Roozeboom et al . , 2015 ; Salim et al . , 2003 ; Schulze et al . , 2005 ; Shumack et al . , 2002 ; Szeimies et al . , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ] . The baseline characteristics of each study were summarized in Table 1 . All patients were adults and follow - up time varied from 3 to 60 months . The network plots gave us a better scope of the direct connections and sample size among the treating regimens ( Figure S2 ) . In all , there were 7 groups of interventions including PDT , IM , CT , vehicle ( VE ) , SE , RT and FU for the four outcomes but six groups for each outcome in that some interventions were missing under particular outcomes . CLR , CLC along with CRP were considered as three efficacy evaluation outcomes while AEs was included as the safety indicator . Efficacy Outcomes The NMA results showing odds ratio ( OR ) and associated 95 % credible interval ( CrI ) of different interventions regarding three efficacy outcomes ( CLR , CLC and CRP ) were illustrated in This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved Table 2 . From the results , when compared with VE , both IM and SE demonstrated significantly higher CLR rate ( OR : 9 . 12 , 95 % CrI : 1 . 92 - 47 . 5 ; OR : 26 . 1 , 95 % CrI : 1 . 92 - 347 ; respectively ) . With respect to the CLC , only IM was proved to be statistically better than VE ( OR : 7 . 03 , 95 % CrI : 1 . 51 - 32 . 8 ) . No significant difference was observed concerning other intervention comparison groups associated with the above two efficacy outcomes and CRP . Safety Outcome AEs could reflect the safety characteristic of treatments . No obvious AEs difference was detected for most of the intervention comparisons , except for IM vs VE in Table 2 . It was suggested that IM was more likely to induce AEs among NMSC patients than VE ( OR = 4 . 44 , 95 % CrI : 1 . 58 - 13 . 9 ) . Consistency Assessment Significant inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence was not detected among the various treatment comparisons with the P - value displayed in the node - splitting plots being lower than 0 . 05 ( Figure 1 ) . Direct , indirect and network results combining the former two evidence types were also revealed in the forms of odds ratio and the corresponding 95 % CrI . Consistent with the node - splitting plots , the heat plots did not indicate any severe discrepancy for CLR , CLC nor AEs evidence ( Figure 2 ) . Treatment Rankings The rankings from 1 to 6 as well as the associated surface under cumulative ranking curve ( SUCRA ) values for different treatments regarding four outcomes were displayed in Table 3 . The top three ranked interventions were particularly shown in bold face . With respect to CLR , SE was the most preferable treatment with a SUCRA of 0 . 91while PDT and IM ranked the second and third ( SUCRA : 0 . 63 and 0 . 61 , respectively ) . When it comes to CLC , SE was again ranked first showing a This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved high SUCRA of 0 . 91 . In this case , IM and CT were the medium effective treatments ( SUCRA : 0 . 64 and 0 . 55 , respectively ) . CRP ranking also identified SE as the most favored one . Considering the safety factor AEs , CT and VE were the top two interventions that had low possibility for patients to develop AEs with SUCRAs of 0 . 85 and 0 . 83 , respectively . SE ranked the third and demonstrated moderate level compared with other interventions with a SUCRA of 0 . 52 . Moreover , according to the cluster plots , no matter which clustering criteria were chosen , SE was the most favored intervention , located at the top right corners of the plots ( Figure 3 ) . Publication Bias The assessment of publication bias was achieved by examining the symmetry of the dots distribution shown in Figure S3 . The distribution of the dots indicates no obvious publication bias among the trials . Discussion Primary Findings Due to the high cure rate of NMSC , clinical trials aimed at treating this kind of disease did not investigate the survival data as usual ; instead , the included studies here adopted a few binary outcomes such as the CLR , CLC and CRP to assess the treatment efficacy . This NMA compared 7 interventions for the treating of NMSC in view of CLR , CLC , CRP and AEs . Based on the network results and SUCRA rankings , SE was eventually recommended as the optimal intervention that had the best efficacy and moderate safety . Efficacy outcomes demonstrated that SE had statistically higher CLR than VE and with respect to CLC . No obvious difference was displayed for most of the intervention comparisons when it came to the safety outcome AEs , except for IM vs VE . Although significant difference was not detected for most of the intervention comparisons , superiority of This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved some therapies could still be observed via the SUCRA calculation and cluster plots . According to the SUCRA results , SE appeared on the first place concerning the outcome of all CLR , CLC and CRP . In addition , quite different from the efficacy evaluation , the safety outcome AEs identified CT and VE as the top two interventions that were of less probability for NMSC patients to experience adverse events compared to others . Nevertheless , when incorporating AEs with CLR , CLC or CRP in cluster plots , we could not suggest a treatment with both highest effectiveness and safety . SE did not perform well in this case but it still occupied moderate ranking . Thus , combing the efficacy and safety outcomes , we still regarded SE as the most excellent regimen for NMSC . Confirmation and Discrepancy from Other Studies It should be noted that consistency and discrepancy both existed between our findings and other publications . For instance , Beutner et al . [ Beutner et al . , 1999 ] concluded that the BCC clearance was higher for IM than VE . This finding corresponded with our calculation that IM was statistically better than VE considering the CLC outcome . With respect to the relatively new therapy PDT , it was proved to be similar in recurrence rates to CT [ Basset - Seguin et al . , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ] in the case of BCC treating , while another study done by Morton et al . [ Morton et al . , 2006 ] illustrated that PDT was higher in efficacy considering the sustained lesion response compared with CT when applied to SCC patients . The above conclusions were also in line with what we found that considering CLR , PDT ranked higher than CT while they showed no obvious SUCRA difference with respect to CRP . PDT was also proved to be better than the traditional intervention FU [ Morton et al . , 2006 ; Salim et al . , 2003 ] with regard to CLC , CLR , CRP and AEs in treating the SCC subgroup of NMSC . However , our study displayed its inferiority to FU with regard to CRP . This might be attributed to the particular patient background ( SCC and BD subgroups ) in the above publications . Thus , future subgroup analyses that are targeted at treating one particular type of This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved NMSC might be of necessity in order to offer a more reliable and subgroup - specific suggestion . In addition , considering both efficacy and safety characteristics , IM was thought to be superior to PDT in the field of BCC treating [ Arits et al . , 2013 ] . And this study suggested IM to be the preferred therapy , which contradicted with what we offered in this NMA . Although IM showed higher clearance rate and lower recurrence rate than PDT , it ranked poorly with respect to AEs . Therefore , there existed an inconsistency concerning IM safety , which could possibly be owing to the single blinded study method applied in the particular study , lowering the results credibility . According to one meta - analysis study [ Bath - Hextall et al . , 2007b ] , SE and RT seemed to be more efficacious than other interventions ( PDT , CT , FU and IM ) with SE demonstrating lower failure rate . Another RCT study also concluded that SE was significantly better than RT [ Avril et al . , 1997 ] . This result further confirmed our findings that combining the three efficacy outcomes ( CLR , CLC and CRP ) , SE was the most excellent regimen for NMSC , with SUCRA rankings all being the first . Meanwhile , SE with a predetermined margin is the treatment recommended by United Kingdom National Multidisciplinary Guidelines of NMSC for the majority of both BCCs and SCCs [ Newlands et al . , 2016 ] , which is also consistent with our study . This superiority of SE might probably due to the fact that this intervention practice is believed to be more thorough and clearance is generally confirmed . The overall high curing rate of NMSC was one result of the non - metastatic property of NMSC and thus by means of SE practice , patients could get rid of the local lesions . As to the safety of different interventions , it was reported that patients treated with FU or IM often reported moderate to severe local swelling , erosion and skin itching compared with those treated with PDT [ Arits et al . , 2013 ] , which was consistent with our SUCRA ranking result of AEs that PDT ranked higher and was less likely for patients to undergo AEs than FU and IM although no significance was detected . Another study also stated that PDT caused fewer adverse events than FU This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved [ Salim et al . , 2003 ] . Strengths and Limitation To our knowledge , this is the first NMA aimed at screening out the best regimen ( s ) that are both efficacious and safe for NMSC patients , which could be of great reference significance for the future associated clinical practice . Apart from that , the outcomes that we included in this study contained three efficacy outcomes ( CLR , CLC and CRP ) and one safety outcome AEs , which was quite comprehensive and could assist us with making a reliable therapy suggestion . The 7 interventions consisted of the mainstream therapies nowadays for NMSC . In addition to the NMA methodological advantages over traditional MAs and clinical trials , in this study , the direct and indirect evidence calculated on the basis of Bayesian Model did not show obvious inconsistency , which verified the random - effects model utilization and further confirmed the validity of the NMA results . From the basic characteristics of included RCTs , large sample sizes could be detected for almost all the intervention groups including SE , PDT , IM , CT and FU , which could lower the potential data fluctuation caused by the small number of publication pieces . However , there are still some limitations that this study possesses . Firstly , the CRP was often associated with different follow - up time and in this study , we observed 1 to 5 years of follow up period , which could possibly lead to the inner heterogeneity and further interfere with the interpretation of the CRP outcome . Apart from the heterogeneity caused by the variation of CRP follow - up time , other factors such as the population difference , NMSC subgroup variation , tumor size and location could also result in heterogeneity . It should also be noted that many potential studies concerning the treating of NMSC were inner - group comparison trials . Take PDT treatment for an example , different illumination length and wavelength as well as different cream types ( methylaminolevulinate ( MAL ) and 5 - aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) ) existed inside this treatment This article is protected by copyright . All rights reserved group , making these trials could not be incorporated into the NMA because of the lack of network sufficiency . In addition , cosmetic score outcome is another possible outcome that could be included in future NMA in that it could reflect the cosmetic influence posed by the intervention and patients actually had concerns about it . Conclusion In conclusion , this NMA identified SE as the optimal regimen for NMSC with high efficacy considering CLR , CLC and CRP and moderate AEs when compared with other interventions . It provides evidence for the future clinical choice , while efforts still shall be paid to eliminate the heterogeneity and carry out more advanced studies .

Node - splitting plot A P - value that is less than 0 . 05 indicates a significant inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence for the associated intervention comparison . Odds ratio ( OR ) and 95 % credible intervals ( CrI ) are shown for direct , indirect and network results . Figure 2 . Heat plot The area of the grey squares displays the contribution of the direct estimate in design ( shown in the column ) to the network estimate in design ( shown in the row ) . The colors are associated with the change in inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence ( shown in the row ) after detaching the effect ( shown in the column ) . Cold colors indicate an increase of consistency and warm colors indicate a decrease of consistency ( the stronger the intensity of the color , the stronger the change ) . Figure 3 . Cluster analysis plot Cluster results are based on the surface under cumulative ranking area ( SUCRA ) values for different interventions . The dots located in the top right corner indicate their superiority while the dots located in the left bottom indicate their inferiority . This article is protected by copyright .
