Thanks to technological and 48 methodological advances , transmission chain data is increasingly available , providing 49 information about individual - level transmission . However , it remains unclear how 50 effectively and under what conditions such data can inform on transmission patterns 51 between groups . 52 In this paper , we introduce a novel metric that leverages transmission chain data to 53 estimate group transmission assortativity ; this quantifies the extent to which individuals 54 transmit within their own group compared to others . Through extensive simulations , we 55 assessed the conditions under which our estimator performs effectively and established 56 guidelines for minimal data requirements . Notably , we demonstrate that detecting and 57 quantifying transmission assortativity is most reliable when groups have reached their 58 epidemic peaks , consist of at least 30 cases each , and represent at least 10 % of the total 59 population each . 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 .

Policies and interventions may differ 69 substantially depending on how much transmission is within groups or between them . However , 70 assessing transmission patterns between groups is challenging as these patterns are not only 71 influenced by social contacts but also by variations in individual susceptibility and infectiousness , 72 which changes over time . To address this challenge , we developed an estimator that utilises 73 information on transmission chains ( who infected whom ) , enabling the identification and 74 quantification of transmission patterns between groups . Through extensive simulations , we 75 assessed the conditions under which our estimator performs effectively and established guidelines 76 for minimal data requirements . Our results suggest that inferring transmission patterns is most 77 reliable when groups have reached their respective epidemic peaks , contain at least 30 cases each 78 and constitute at least 10 % or more of the total population , each . 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 .

However , these measures could not 96 always be optimised in real - time due to a lack of quantitative understanding regarding the varying 97 roles different groups played in disease transmission . For example , the decision to close schools 98 was initially based on the assumption that children were significant drivers of transmission [ 1 , 2 ] . Yet , 99 subsequent research suggested that children may be less susceptible to infection and that schools 100 may not have played a major role in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 3 – 6 ] . 101 The ability to detect and quantify the contributions of different groups to transmission during an 102 outbreak is essential for implementing effective control measures . Not only does it enhance our 103 comprehension of transmission dynamics within a population , but it may also lead to better 104 predictions of the epidemic’s future trajectory and enables the development of evidence - based public 105 health strategies tailored to the outbreak’s characteristics . 106 Broadly , two approaches have been employed to assess the contributions of different groups to 107 epidemic transmission . First , dedicated surveys have been conducted to measure the frequency of 108 contact between different groups ; combined with information about the relative infectiousness and 109 susceptibility of each group ( e . g . obtained from epidemiological or serological investigations ) , these 110 data can be used by transmission models to estimate transmission assortativity [ 7 , 8 ] . Unfortunately , 111 the underlying contact data can be biased , have limited sample size or representativeness , and may 112 not be generalisable across different epidemic contexts [ 9 – 11 ] . 113 Alternatively , transmission assortativity can be directly assessed from observed transmission 114 patterns e . g . by measuring the proportion of cases in different groups [ 12 , 13 ] or by reconstructing 115 the transmission chains [ 14 , 15 ] . These approaches have their own limitations . For instance , 116 accurately reconstructing transmission chains is challenging [ 16 ] and even with perfectly known 117 transmission chains , transmission assortativity estimation may be impeded by differences in group 118 sizes and group - level saturation ( i . e . the depletion of susceptibles ) . 119 This paper introduces a novel framework for evaluating transmission patterns among distinct groups 120 .

We 121 evaluate the performance of our estimator through simulations across diverse outbreak scenarios 122 and offer guidance on the minimum data collection requirements and the optimal estimation 123 timeframe to inform policy . 124 125 Methods 126 A new estimator of transmission assortativity 127 Assortativity has been amply described for social mixing patterns , with homogeneous mixing 128 referring to random contacts between individuals , and heterogeneous mixing denoting interactions 129 characterised by distinct ( non - random ) patterns depending on group memberships [ 7 ] . 130 Heterogeneous mixing can be either assortative , where individuals tend to interact more within their 131 own group ( e . g . social contacts by age [ 9 , 17 , 18 ] ) , or disassortative , where individuals interact 132 preferentially with members of other groups ( e . g . sexual contacts [ 19 ] ) . Here we use these definitions 133 to characterise the patterns of transmission rather than contact . 134 To quantify transmission assortativity , we examine the person - to - person transmission patterns . We 135 denote β b←a the person - to - person transmission rate from an individual in group a to an individual in 136 group b . We assume that β a←a can be expressed as β a←a = γ a β b←a ( with a ≠ b ) , where γ a is the 137 assortativity coefficient for group a . γ a is defined as the excess probability of a secondary infection 138 taking place within group a compared to random expectation . γ values range from 0 ( fully 139 disassortative ) to ∞ ( fully assortative ) , with 1 indicating homogeneous patterns . For instance , γ a = 2 140 indicates that an infected individual from group a is twice as likely to infect an individual from the 141 same group compared to infecting an individual from another group . Conversely , a γ a of 1 / 2 means 142 that an infected individual from group a is twice as likely to infect an individual from another group 143 compared to infecting an individual from the same group . 144 We consider G groups of relative sizes f 1 , . . . , f G defined as : 145 .

Among infections generated by infected 153 individuals in group a , the proportion of secondary cases in group a , π a←a , can therefore be 154 calculated as : 155 ( 5 ) where τ a←a is the number of observed within - group transmission pairs and τ . ←a is the total number of 156 infections coming from group a . We can obtain a confidence interval ( CI ) on π a←a for various 157 significance ( α ) levels using the Clopper - Pearson binomial interval method [ 20 ] ( S1 . 2 ) . Feeding 158 estimates of π a←a from equation 5 into equation 4 , provides estimates of γ a with confidence intervals . 159 To simplify interpretation , we introduce a rescaled parameter δ , ranging between - 1 ( fully 160 disassortative ) and 1 ( fully assortative ) , with 0 corresponding to a homogeneous transmission 161 pattern ( Figure S1 ) , defined as : 162 .

Simulations were specified with : i ) group - level parameters including the 167 size of each group , their assortativity coefficients ( δ ) , initial introductions , basic reproduction 168 numbers ( R 0 ) and ii ) epidemic level parameters such as the number of groups , the pathogen 169 generation time ( w ) and incubation period ( v ) distributions ( both assumed the same across groups ) . 170 The simulation outputs the transmission tree of the infected individuals including their group and that 171 of their infector , their date of infection and date of symptom onset . We constructed 10 , 000 sets of 172 input parameters , referred to as ‘scenarios’ , by randomly sampling parameters from pre - defined 173 distributions ( S1 . 3 , Figure S2 ) . To account for stochasticity , we conducted 100 simulations for each 174 unique scenario resulting in a total of 1 , 000 , 000 simulated outbreaks . 175 In our branching process model , the force of infection ( FOI ) generated by individual j from group a 176 at time t , towards each individual in group b is defined as : 177 178 ( 7 ) where : 179 ● s ja is the time of infection of individual j in group a 180 ● R 0 a is the basic reproduction number of individuals in group a 181 The total FOI that group b receives from all groups at time t is obtained as : 182 .

The simulation progresses in 188 discrete daily time steps for 365 days . Nearly all simulations ( 99 . 99 % ) finished with the last infection 189 occurring before day 300 . Note that we assume that individuals who have been infected become 190 fully immune . 191 Assuming that b i ( i th individual in group b ) was infected at time t + 1 , their infector is drawn across 192 all infected individuals in all groups from a multinomial distribution with probabilities : 193 ( 11 ) Where a j is the j th individual in group a . 194 To assess the performance of our estimator , we computed 4 different performance metrics for each 195 scenario : 196 ● Bias : defined as the average difference between the true δ value and its estimate ( 𝛿̂ ) across 197 100 simulations . It is a measure of the estimator’s systematic error and inaccuracy and should 198 be close to 0 . Bias is positive when δ is underestimated , indicating underestimation of 199 assortativity or overestimation of disassortativity . Conversely , negative bias occurs when δ is 200 overestimated , indicating overestimation of assortativity or underestimation of 201 .

We evaluate 4 significance 204 levels 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 25 and 0 . 5 . Assessing coverage helps determine the reliability of the 205 confidence intervals generated by the estimator . Coverage should approximate 1 - α , and the 206 coverage error , which measures the deviation from this target , should be close to 0 . A positive 207 coverage error suggests underestimation of uncertainty , while a negative coverage error 208 indicates overestimation . 209 ● Sensitivity ( true positive rate ) : defined as the proportion of simulations ( out of 100 ) where the 210 estimator correctly identifies a significant assortative or disassortative effect ( i . e . the 𝛿̂ CI 211 doesn’t contain 0 ) . Sensitivity should be close to 1 ( 100 % ) . 212 ● Specificity ( true negative rate ) : defined as the proportion of simulations ( out of 100 ) where 213 the estimator correctly identifies no significant assortative or disassortative effect ( i . e . the 𝛿̂ 214 CI contains 0 ) . Specificity should be close to 1 ( 100 % ) . 215 216 We evaluated the estimator ' s performance at various stages of the outbreak , defined in relation to 217 the group ' s epidemic peak , i . e . the day with the highest symptom onset incidence following the first 218 case . Denoting T the date of the group’s peak incidence , we define the analysis time window as the 219 time period from the first case of the group to day T x ε , where ε represents any non - negative real 220 number and is referred to as the “peak coefficient” . A peak coefficient value of ε = 1 implies analysis 221 until the group ' s peak , while values above or below 1 imply analysis using data up to before or after 222 the peak respectively ( S1 . 4 , Figure S3 ) . Additionally , we introduce the term ' peak asynchronicity ' , 223 calculated as the standard deviation of peak dates T across groups , to measure heterogeneity in the 224 groups ' peak dates . 225 226 To assess the impact of the scenario parameters on the performance metrics , separate regressions 227 were conducted with each performance metric as a dependent variable and scenario parameters as 228 independent variables ( S1 . 5 ) . 229 .

Halfway before the epidemic peak ( peak coefficient ε = 0 . 5 ) , coverage at α 238 levels up to 25 % was too low , with average errors of 0 . 22 , 0 . 18 and 0 . 07 for α levels of 5 , 10 , and 239 25 % , respectively . In contrast , the 50 % coverage was too high with an average error of - 0 . 10 . Around 240 the epidemic peak ( ε 0 . 7 - 1 . 3 ) , coverage for α = 5 - 10 % was good , whilst coverage for α = 25 - 50 % 241 was too high ( average error - 0 . 14 ) . At later epidemic stages ( ε 1 . 5 - 5 ) , coverage was good across 242 most significance levels , although the 50 % coverage remained high across all epidemic stages . 243 244 Sensitivity and specificity were contingent upon the CI significance level α and the stage of the 245 group’s epidemic ( ε ) ( Figure 1C ) . Larger α values enhanced sensitivity at the expense of specificity , 246 irrespective of the epidemic stage . And , regardless of α , analysing transmission chains later in the 247 epidemic ( i . e . increasing ε ) also enhanced sensitivity , although this improvement was marginal past 248 a peak coefficient of 1 . 5 . However , the gain in sensitivity relative to the loss in specificity induced by 249 delaying the analysis varied with α , with more pronounced tradeoffs for larger α values . 250 251 Figure 2 presents the relationship between various epidemic characteristics ( columns ) and the 252 estimator’s performance metrics ( rows ) , for a peak coefficient of 1 and a significance level of 0 . 05 . 253 Additional configurations are shown in supplementary materials ( Figure S6 ) . 254 255 Our estimator maintained consistent unbiased performance across the entire assortativity range ( δ 256 from - 1 to 1 ) ( Figure 2 column A row 1 ) . Coverage consistently met the 95 % target for δ < 0 . 5 , with 257 a slight decrease in coverage performance for δ > 0 . 5 , although coverage remained close to the 258 .

This decrease in coverage in highly assortative 259 scenarios could be due to a saturation effect : high assortativity will accelerate the depletion of 260 susceptibles in the group , eventually resulting in lower observed assortativity compared to the true 261 value ( Figure S4 ) . Although the assortativity coefficient δ only had a small effect on bias or coverage , 262 it had a substantial impact on sensitivity , which was higher for larger absolute values of δ . However , 263 sensitivity rose more gradually as ❘ δ ❘ increased on the disassortative scale compared to the 264 assortative scale ( Figure 2A3 , Table S1 . 1 ) , reaching an average of 82 % for δ ≥ 0 . 5 compared to 265 55 % for δ ≤ - 0 . 5 , suggesting a better ability to detect assortative than disassortative transmission . 266 Indeed , assortative transmission implies that transmissions propagate within the same group across 267 multiple generations , consequently increasing the sample size ( τ . ←a in equation 5 ) compared to 268 disassortative transmission , and thus narrowing the CI , thereby enhancing sensitivity . Our linear 269 regression suggested that the assortativity coefficient explained nearly 60 % of the variance observed 270 in sensitivity ( Table S1 . 1 ) . 271 272 Increasing the number of cases substantially reduced bias ( Figure 2C1 , Table S2 ) , and increased 273 sensitivity ( Figure 2C3 , Table S1 . 2 ) but had little effect on specificity or coverage ( Figure 2C4 and 274 2C2 ) . Bias was negligible ( mean : 0 . 04 , sd : 0 . 07 ) once the group reached 30 to 40 cases . Sensitivity 275 was positively correlated with the number of cases : controlling for δ , the odds of detecting an 276 assortative or disassortative pattern increased by 4 % with each additional case ( Table S1 . 2 ) . 277 278 The relative size of the group had a substantial effect on bias ( Figure 2B1 , Table S2 ) and sensitivity 279 ( Figure 2 B3 , Table S1 . 2 ) but no effect on specificity ( Figure 2B4 ) nor coverage ( Figure 2B2 ) . When 280 groups comprised 10 % or more of the total population size , bias was close to 0 ( Figure 2B1 ) , and 281 the odds of detecting an assortative pattern increased fourfold , compared to smaller groups ( odds 282 ratios ( OR ) = 4 . 15 , 95 % CI = 4 . 07 – 4 . 24 ) ( Figure 2B3 , Table S . 1 . 2 ) . Relative size and the number 283 of cases jointly accounted for 72 % of the variation in bias ( Table S2 ) , and contributed to a 42 % 284 increase in the pseudo R - squared for the linear regression on sensitivity ( from 0 . 566 in Table S1 . 1 285 to 0 . 805 in Table S1 . 2 ) . 286 287 .

This diversity results in varying saturation 289 levels between groups over time , affecting transmission patterns within and between groups . Peak 290 asynchronicity , a measure of heterogeneity in epidemic peak timing across groups was negatively 291 associated with coverage ( OR = 0 . 78 , 95 % CI = 0 . 78 - 0 . 78 ) and specificity ( OR = 0 . 76 , 95 % CI = 292 0 . 76 - 0 . 76 ) , explaining 18 % and 24 % of the variance , respectively ( Table S3 and S4 , Figure 2D2 and 293 2D4 ) . These results suggest a decrease in our estimator’s performance with increasing 294 heterogeneity between groups . However , our estimates remained unbiased ( Figure 2D1 ) and with 295 consistent sensitivity ( Figure 2D3 ) irrespective of that heterogeneity . 296 297 In summary , analysing transmission chains at least up to the group’s epidemic peak generally 298 improved all performance metrics . Near the group’s epidemic peak , coverage with significance levels 299 of 5 or 10 % yielded good performance , while levels of 25 and 50 % were a bit too high , improving 300 after the peak . Specificity was higher at lower significance levels , while sensitivity was higher at 301 larger significance levels . Increased cases and relative group size contributed to improved estimator 302 accuracy , reduced bias , and heightened sensitivity , with no significant impact on coverage nor 303 specificity . Complex epidemic settings , measured through peak asynchronicity , did not significantly 304 affect sensitivity or bias but were associated with a reduction in coverage and specificity . 305 Discussion 306 We developed a method to detect and quantify the transmission assortativity of different groups 307 based on transmission chains . We performed an extensive simulation study covering a range of 308 epidemic scenarios to assess the performance of our approach . 309 310 Our results indicate that the estimator ' s performance is influenced by assortativity patterns , relative 311 group sizes , number of cases , and peak dates asynchronicity . 312 Generally , analysing transmission chains too early in the outbreak , before the group’s epidemic 313 peak , results in poor performance across all metrics considered . On the other hand , delaying 314 assortativity coefficient estimation poses challenges for timely policy implementation . Choosing 315 .

For instance , minimising 317 bias and maximising sensitivity is best achieved later in the epidemic , past the group’s peak , and 318 using larger significance levels . Conversely , improving coverage and maximising specificity is 319 easiest before the group ' s epidemic peak and using lower significance levels . Nevertheless , 320 estimating assortativity at a target time before or at the peak requires accurate prediction of the 321 group’s peak date which can be very challenging . 322 As a rule of thumb , we suggest analysing all available transmission chain data up to the group’s 323 epidemic peak with a significance level of 0 . 05 . Under this setting , our estimator provides a generally 324 accurate measure of assortativity with reliable coverage and specificity albeit lower sensitivity . 325 326 Detecting non - homogeneous transmission patterns ( sensitivity ) in the presence of relatively small 327 groups ( i . e . a group constituting less than 10 % of the total population ) , with groups having fewer 328 than 30 cases is challenging , particularly when assortative or disassortative patterns are mild ( - 0 . 5 329 ≤ δ ≤ 0 . 5 ) . Importantly , it is considerably easier to detect assortativity than disassortativity , given that 330 assortativity yields more transmission events within the group considered ( where most new 331 infections appear ) compared to disassortativity ( where new infections tend to appear in other groups , 332 by definition ) . Hence , all other things being equal , larger sample sizes are more easily achieved in 333 assortative groups . 334 335 Our approach complements traditional survey - based methods when transmission chains are 336 available . Worby et al . ' s relative risk estimation [ 12 ] , measuring each group’s proportional change in 337 infection incidence before and after the peak , and Abbas et al . ' s assessment method [ 15 ] , comparing 338 actual and expected proportions of infections across groups , do not consider the influence of group 339 size . By integrating group size into our approach , we account for variations in the pool of susceptible 340 individuals within each group , offering a more comprehensive understanding of transmission 341 dynamics . Consequently , our approach should provide novel insights into the impact of group 342 dynamics when estimating transmission patterns . 343 344 .

Although transmission trees can be reconstructed from data , such reconstruction effort 346 comes with inherent uncertainty , which we have not considered here . Conventional epidemiological 347 investigations may provide reliable transmission chains but require intensive labour for contact 348 tracing , data collection and analysis , and may be prone to error [ 21 ] . Statistical approaches have 349 been developed to reconstruct who infected whom using data on contacts , symptoms onset dates , 350 and pathogen genome sequences [ 22 ] , but in some contexts even these prove insufficient to 351 precisely reconstruct transmission trees [ 14 , 23 ] . Our study underscores the challenges of inferring 352 group contributions in some scenarios , even in the hypothetical instance where transmission trees 353 are perfectly known . Nevertheless , our approach is adaptable and can be extended to reconstructed 354 transmission chains , for example , by estimating the assortativity coefficient across all posterior 355 transmission trees in the setting of Abbas et al . [ 15 ] . Future research should delve into understanding 356 how uncertainty surrounding these transmission trees further impacts our ability to infer transmission 357 patterns . 358 359 Another limitation of our approach includes that our estimator requires information on group sizes 360 which may be difficult to obtain in real - life settings , however various methods exist for population 361 size estimation [ 24 ] . Our simulations also assumed that individuals who have been infected become 362 permanently immune , an assumption which is typically valid over short time frames but may be 363 unrealistic over longer time horizons . 364 365 Despite these limitations , this study provides a valuable first step towards evaluating the 366 contributions of different groups to the transmission of infectious diseases and informing targeted 367 control policy . 368 369 370 .

Distribution of bias ( the mean difference between the true assortativity δ value and its estimate ) 401 by peak coefficient . The peak coefficient ( ε ) is a non - negative real number used to define the analysis 402 time window in relation to the group ' s epidemic peak . It determines the analysis period from the first 403 case to the day Tε , where T is the date of peak incidence for the group . A value of ε = 1 indicates 404 analysis up to the group’s peak date , while values above or below 1 extend the analysis to data after 405 or before the group’s peak date , respectively . 406 B . Mean coverage ( proportion of simulations where the true δ value is within the estimated CI ) by 407 peak coefficient for each significance level ( blue shades ) . 408 C . The Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) ( the trade - off between sensitivity and specificity ) 409 curves by peak coefficient ( orange - pink points ) for each significance level ( blue shaded lines ) . 410 In panel A , each point shows the mean metric value across all scenarios for a given peak coefficient . 411 In panels B and C , each point shows the mean metric value across all scenarios for a given peak 412 coefficient and significance level . Dashed lines refer to the metric’s target value for A and B and 413 represent a random classifier ' s ROC performance for C . 414 .
