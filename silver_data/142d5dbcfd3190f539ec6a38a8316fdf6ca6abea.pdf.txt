Gulping rather than sipping : macropinocytosis as a way of virus entry Jason Mercer and Ari Helenius Macropinocytosis has emerged as a major endocytic mechanism in the cell entry of animal viruses . The process differs fundamentally from other endocytic mechanisms involved in virus internalization . By activating growth factor receptors or other signaling molecules , plasma membrane - bound viruses trigger the activation of a signaling pathway . When ampliﬁed , this causes a transient , global change in cell behavior . The consequences of this change include the actin - dependent formation of membrane protrusions , the elevation of non - speciﬁc uptake of ﬂuid , and the internalization of membrane together with surface - bound ligands and particles including viruses . Recent studies show that this strategy is used by a variety of enveloped and non - enveloped viruses .

Release of the viruses themselves or their capsids into the cytosol occurs through the penetration of membranes in endosomes or other downstream organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum . While many viruses bind to receptors and follow these receptors into cells exploiting clathrin - coated vesicles for internalization , it is now increasingly evident that others depend on clathrin - inde - pendent endocytic mechanisms [ 2 – 4 ] . Macropinocytosis , a ligand - induced mechanism for the uptake of ﬂuid and solutes , has in the last few years emerged as a major mechanism for virus infection . The viruses that use it belong to different families . They include enveloped and non - enveloped viruses , RNA and DNA viruses , large and small . For some , the macropinocytic entry pathway seems to be one of several possible pathways . Others seem to be using variants of the general theme with properties different from classical macropinocytosis . In this review , we will describe the salient features of this rather unusual endocytic mechanism and the membrane trafﬁcking pathways downstream of initial uptake . We will discuss the data collected for the various viruses , and attempt to ﬁt these data into the larger cell biological picture . What is macropinocytosis ? In contrast to phagocytosis , a cargo - triggered endocytosis mechanism involving the uptake of large particles through locally assembled machinery , macropinocytosis is primarily responsible for nonspeciﬁc uptake of ﬂuid , solutes , membrane , ligands , and smaller particles attached to the plasma membrane . In most cell types , it is not a continuously ongoing process , but rather tran - siently triggered , and when activated , operational for a limited time . Physiological ligands such as growth factors , integrin substrates , and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) - contain - ing cell remnants serve as speciﬁc triggers [ 5 – 7 ] . A complex signaling pathway is activated by these ligands . When ampliﬁed in the cell , the signal induces an increase of endocytosis and a transient global change in cell behavior . These changes may include alterations in cell shape , motility , plasma membrane dynamics , and so on [ 8 ] . Many of these events result from changes in actin dynamics . The activation of ﬂuid phase endocytosis is the consequence of plasma membrane rufﬂing ( see Box 1 ) . The collapse of these rufﬂes results in the formation of large uncoated , irregularly shaped , ﬂuid - ﬁlled endocytic vacuoles called macropinosomes ( reviewed in [ 18 ] ) . Uptake of ﬂuid is transiently elevated ( 30 – 60 min ) up to ten - fold above the basal rate , and as a rule it is not restricted to any speciﬁc region of the cell surface . It is also recognized that macropinocytosis can lead to uptake of particles as well as ﬂuid . The uptake of particles is , in fact , physiologically important for the clearance of cell debris left behind after apoptosis of cells in tissues [ 7 ] . The non - speciﬁc aspect of the uptake process is probably an advantage for the viruses involved . Instead of having to bind to speciﬁc receptor molecules , as other viruses do , those that trigger macropinocytosis can initially bind to any surface component . Once bound these viruses some - how ‘tickle’ the appropriate receptors in the plasma membrane to turn on the macropinocytosis program . Available online at www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Microbiology 2012 , 15 : 490 – 499 www . sciencedirect . com When uptake begins , it is the consequence of a cell - wide change , and occurs in seemingly arbitrary locations . Thus any bound virus , whether associated with the activating receptors or not , has a chance for internalization . The non - speciﬁc nature of macropinocytosis also renders the path - way useful for delivery of other cargo : it is increasingly viewed as a promising gateway for the delivery of peptides , proteins , nanocarriers , therapeutics , and so on [ 18 – 21 ] . Criteria for macropinocytic virus entry Macropinocytosis can be divided into ﬁve steps that depend on distinct sets of cellular factors ; ( 1 ) Virus binding , ( 2 ) Activation of intracellular signaling , ( 3 ) Plasma membrane protrusion , ( 4 ) Vacuole closure and formation , and ( 5 ) Macropinosome trafﬁcking . Some of the key players in these steps and their roles are illus - trated schematically in Figure 1 . There is no single diagnostic test reliable enough to deﬁne whether a given virus uses macropinocytosis . However , reliance on actin dynamics and Na + / H + exchange can provide a rapid and consistent ﬁrst glance . To this end , disruption of actin with jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D , and Na + / H + exchange using amiloride or Macropinocytosis as a way of virus entry Mercer and Helenius 491 Box 1 Macropinocytic protrusions Depending on cell type , conditions , choice of receptors , activation mechanisms , and properties of the virus , the macropinocytic protru - sions induced can take different forms [ 9 , 10 (cid:2) ] . ( a ) Lamellopodial ruffles . Some viruses ( Ebola and Adeno 35 ) , as well as stimulation with epidermal growth factor [ 6 ] cause formation of large , motile , flattened lamellopodia . ( b ) Circular ruffles . Stimulation of cells with platelet derived growth factor leads to the formation of thin crown - like projections called ‘circular ruffles’ on top of the cell [ 11 ] . The resulting macropino - some formation is dynamin - dependent . Macropinocytosis of HIV - 1 , HRV8 , HRV14 , and BTV - 1 have been described as dynamin - dependent . ( c ) Filopodial protrusions . In some instances , macropinocytosis involves the formation of thin finger - like filopodia . This has been described for VV MVs ( strain IHD - J ) and Nipah virus [ 9 , 10 (cid:2) , 12 ] . ( d ) Blebs . Membrane blebbing was demonstrated for VV mature virions of the WR strain and extracellular virions [ 13 , 14 (cid:2) ] as well as KSHV [ 15 , 16 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Bleb formation relies on actin destabilization rather than stabilization . The images presented have been reproduced with permission from [ 9 ] and [ 17 ] .

To deﬁne experimentally whether a virus uses macropi - nocytosis , several additional approaches are needed . Most important is to determine which cellular proteins the entry process depends on , and which not . This is typically done by determining whether infection – or preferably endocy - tosis of the virus – is affected by perturbing key players using inhibitors , siRNA - mediated or shRNA - mediated depletion , or expression of mutant constructs . We have in a previous review recommended a set of experimental criteria to assess virus entry by macropinocytosis [ 17 ] . In addition to dependence on actin and Na + / H + exchangers , they include the Rho GTPases ( Rac1 or Cdc42 ) , p21 - activated kinase 1 ( Pak1 ) , PI ( 3 ) K , and protein kinase C ( PKC ) . Together with evidence for rufﬂing or blebbing and a transient elevation in ﬂuid uptake , they provide positive evidence for a macropinocytic uptake process . The dependence on dynamin - 2 , receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , and myosin II are examples of supporting but less reliable discrimi - nators . Exclusion of clathrin - mediated and caveolar / lipid raft - mediated endocytosis is also important . Electron microscopy is valuable to visualize the size of primary endocytic vesicles that contain viruses , and the presence or absence of cytoplasmic coats . Light - microscopy is especially useful for the characterization of rufﬂing / bleb - bing , as well as for the detection of viruses in ﬂuid - containing vacuoles after endocytosis . It is clear that any set of criteria chosen leaves open a degree of ambiguity that is ampliﬁed by cell type differences and the general complexity in the regulation of vesicular trafﬁcking [ 22 ] . In the ﬁeld of cell biology , the classiﬁcation of endocytic mechanisms is still far from complete [ 23 ] . That many viruses use more than one entry mechanism [ 24 ] does not make deﬁnition of pathways easier .

Macropinocytosis of viruses occurs in five stages ; Binding , signaling , membrane protrusion , vacuole closure and formation , and trafficking . Each stage is governed by a unique set of cellular factors with some overlaps . Virus binding often occurs through rather non - specific attachment factors ( such as glycosaminoglycans ) . These serve to concentrate the viruses on the plasma membrane or to bring them to specific sites that facilitate activation of internalization receptors . Engagement of a variety of cell - surface receptors ( receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) such as EGFR , integrins , and in some cases PS receptors ) is used to activate kinases ( blue ) , GTPases ( gray ) , adaptors ( purple ) , and other factors such as Na + / H + exchangers , phospholipases , myosins and fission / fusion factors ( orange ) . This signaling cascade triggers actin rearrangement and plasma membrane protrusion and ruffling ( see Box 1 ) . Circular ( crown - like ) ruffles , blebs , and lamellipodia are displayed here . To form an endocytic vacuole ( a macropinosome ) the protrusions collapse back on the plasma membrane forming an invagination . The membrane fission events that separate the macropinosomes from the extracellular space differ depending on the type of protrusion . Closing of circular ruffles is dynamin - dependent , lamellipodial ruffles close via the action of CtBP1 / Bars , and the cellular factors that govern closure of bleb - derived macropinosomes are not known . After closure , the newly formed macropinosomes move into the cytoplasm where they rely on a further set of cellular factors for trafficking and maturation ( see Figure 2 ) . Solid arrows represent direct allosteric or catalytic activation and dashed arrows represent interactions that serve in signal amplification , macropinosome closure , and trafficking . Current Opinion in Microbiology 2012 , 15 : 490 – 499 www . sciencedirect . com duce a further level of uncertainty . As the experimental read - out frequently relies on negative data , that is , lack of endocytosis and infection , it is useful to include control viruses for which the entry pathways are better known , such as vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) , and Semliki forest virus ( SFV ) that do not use macropinocytosis [ 25 – 27 ] . An alternative approach to deﬁning the mechanisms of virus entry is provided by using targeted siRNA or shRNA screening libraries . The approach is based on depleting key factors in the various endocytic mechanisms , and comparing the effects of this on infection by different viruses . We are using a library of siRNAs called the ‘Usual Suspects’ in our lab jargon , and applying it to many different viruses . A pilot version was already published for SV40 [ 26 ] . In the future , it will be considerably easier to determine whether a virus enters by macropinocytosis using such diagnostic screens . Macropinocytic triggers used by viruses In the case of macropinocytosis , one must consider that the interaction between the virus and the cell surface is likely to involve multiple different types of contacts : some providing anchoring to the membrane , others needed for activation of receptors . Attachment can depend on direct contact with speciﬁc receptors or on less - speciﬁc adsorption to extracellular matrix com - ponents such a heparansulphate proteoglycans ( HSPGs ) [ 28 ] . To trigger macropinocytosis , further contacts have to be established with RTKs , PS - receptors , integrins , or other surface molecules capable of activating the appro - priate signaling pathways . The interaction between the virus and the signaling recep - tors is not necessarily a direct one . The viruses simply need to activate the receptors , even if that occurs indirectly , for example through the assistance of bridging molecules . More speciﬁcally , it has been shown that vaccinia virus mature virions ( VV MVs ) , vaccinia virus extracellular vir - ions ( VV EVs ) , inﬂuenza A virus ( IAV ) , and possibly human papillomavirus - 16 ( HPV - 16 ) bind to HSPGs and other glycans before activating classical growth factor receptors , such as epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) [ 10 (cid:2) , 14 (cid:2) , 29 , 30 (cid:2) ] . Other viruses take advantage of integrins to which they bind directly : adenoviruses 3 and 35 to a v - integrins and CD46 , echovirus 1 to a 2 b 1 - integrins , and Kaposi’s sarcoma - associated herpes virus ( KSHV ) to a 3 b 1 , a v b 3 , and a v b 5 integrins [ 31 – 34 ] . The signaling pathways downstream of the different receptors are somewhat vari - able , but they all end up inﬂuencing actin dynamics and inducing endocytosis . Apoptotic mimicry Recent ﬁndings have demonstrated that ‘apoptotic mimi - cry’ is a mechanism used by some of these viruses to trigger macropinocytosis . This strategy relies on the presence of PS on the virus surface to mimic apoptotic debris . Thereby these viruses take advantage of the host cell’s PS - depend - ent apoptotic removal system for internalization [ 35 ] . First suggested for hepatitis B virus [ 36 ] , and subsequently demonstrated experimentally for VV MVs [ 13 ] , PS - mediated macropinocytosis has now been shown to be used by lentiviral vectors , pichinde virus ( a model for Lassa fever virus ) , cytomegaloviruses , Ebola virus , Marburg virus , and possibly HIV - 1 [ 37 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 38 – 40 ] . VV MVs , HIV - 1 , and pichinde virus have been shown to contain PS in their envelope [ 38 , 40 – 42 ] . A connecting factor between virus PS and activating receptors was recently discovered : a serum protein called Gas6 [ 37 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . It belongs to a family of dual function molecules that recognize PS , and on the contrary activate the TAM receptors Tyro3 , Axl , and Mer [ 43 ] . These RTKs serve as receptors for PS - dependent internalization of cell debris and apoptotic bodies [ 44 ] . Using lentivirus vectors , it was demonstrated that Gas6 could enhance PS - dependent infection of non - permissive cell lines by bind - ing to Axl [ 37 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . It will be interesting to see how commonly Gas 6 and similar molecules , like Protein S , serve as bridging factors in virus entry . The macropinocytosis - like pathway used by IAV in A549 cells only appears functional in the presence of serum [ 45 (cid:2) ] . This raises the possibility that a serum factor acts as a bridging component to trigger endocytosis . Axl has also been shown to enhance macro - pinocytic entry of Ebola virus in some cell types [ 39 , 46 ] , although no direct interaction between the Ebola virus glycoprotein and Axl was found [ 47 ] . Thanks to its non - speciﬁc nature , apoptotic mimicry may serve as a general strategy used by enveloped viruses to broaden their tissue and host tropisms . If so , targeting PS on these various pathogens may be an effective broad - range antiviral strategy [ 40 ] . Additionally , PS may provide a general passport for the internalization of nanoparticles and drugs into cells . Viruses that use macropinocytosis In Table 1 , we have collected information about the macropinocytic and macropinocytosis - related entry of viruses as described in the current literature . It is import - ant to note that for most of the viruses the experimental data are still incomplete . For many , the assays used depend on infection as a read - out rather than endocytosis , which leaves open the possibility of post - endocytosis effects . Nevertheless , it is apparent that seven of the viruses ﬁt the criteria for macropinocytic uptake ( see Table 1 ) . Macropinocytosis - like mechanisms The various steps in the macropinocytic process depend on a large number of cell factors ( shown in Figures 1 and 2 ) [ 17 , 18 ] . Here we focus on issues that involve some of these Macropinocytosis as a way of virus entry Mercer and Helenius 493 www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Microbiology 2012 , 15 : 490 – 499 proteins and protein families during macropinocytic virus entry . In certain cases , the authors of papers have invoked ‘macropinocytosis - like’ mechanisms because the results are either incomplete or show deviations from classical macropinocytosis . A clear case of macropinocytic - like virus entry was reported for HPV - 16 [ 30 (cid:2) ] . It was found that endocytosis and infection relies on many hallmarks of classical macro - pinocytosis ( see Table 1 ) , but does not depend on the Rho GTPases . Internalization is , moreover , inhibited by chlorpromazine , a reagent that inhibits clathrin - mediated endocytosis , but does not generally affect macropinocy - tosis [ 30 (cid:2) ] . For HPV - 16 there is no evidence of rufﬂing , and electron microscopy shows viruses in small , uncoated primary endocytic vesicles [ 30 (cid:2) ] . Adeno - associated virus 2 ( AAV2 ) has recently been shown to enter cells by a dynamin - independent pathway sensi - tive to EIPA , and dependent on Cdc42 , Arf1 , Graf1 , and actin polymerization [ 56 (cid:2) ] . While entry was associated with plasma membrane rufﬂing , there was no increase in ﬂuid phase uptake after virus addition [ 56 (cid:2) ] . Although the mechanism seems in many ways macropinocytosis - like , the authors concluded that the virus made use of the so - called CLIC / GEEC pathway , which has not previously been observed to carry viruses . Kinases , GTPases , and other factors Macropinocytosis requires the coordinated activation of multiple kinases ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) [ 17 ] . The process is therefore sensitive to a variety of general and speciﬁc kinase inhibitors . Thus , it is surprising that infection by 494 Host – microbe interactions : Viruses Table 1 Cellular factors used by viruses for macropinocytic entry . The cellular factors involved in macropinocytosis are listed according to molecular function ( cytoskeletal elements , GTPases , and kinases , etc . ) . Their roles are designated as indispensable ( green ) , not required ( red ) , and as not determined ( gray ) . The viruses included use macropinocytosis or macropinocytosis - like entry mechanisms . They represent a wide range of virus families , and include ( S ) and ( + ) single - stranded RNA , double - stranded - RNA , and DNA viruses . They vary in size from 30 nm to 1 m m . Based on the cellular requirements , we can now include Ebola virus , adenovirus 35 ( Ad35 ) , influenza A virus ( IAV ) , Kaposi’s sarcoma - associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) , vaccinia virus extracellular virions ( VV EVs ) , vaccinia virus mature virions of the IHD - J strain ( VV MV IHD - J ) , and Nipah virus to the growing list of viruses using macropinocytosis [ 10 (cid:2) , 12 , 14 (cid:2) , 16 (cid:2)(cid:2) , 32 , 45 (cid:2) , 48 – 52 ] . While more research is required , bluetongue virus 1 ( BTV - 1 ) , and human Rhinoviruses 8 and 14 ( HRV8 and HRV14 ) may be tentatively included [ 53 – 55 ] .

Since these viruses depend on RTKs for infection , this probably reﬂects a general insensitivity of certain tyrosine kinases to this inhibitor , which will be important to keep in mind when studying virus macro - pinocytosis . PI ( 3 ) kinase has been implicated in several stages of macropinocytosis , from membrane protrusion , to macro - pinosome trafﬁcking and fusion [ 18 , 57 – 62 ] . The presence of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in the plasma membrane during macropi - nosome formation coincides with the binding of various SNX - PX - BAR family proteins [ 63 – 66 ] . Therefore it is unexpected that macropinocytosis of VV MVs and EVs of the IHD - J strain , as well as HIV - 1 entry into macro - phages , can occur in the presence of the PI ( 3 ) K inhibitor wortmannin [ 10 (cid:2) , 14 (cid:2) , 67 ] . PI ( 3 ) K - independent macropi - nocytosis also occurs in neuronal cells [ 68 ] . Although the mechanism remains unclear , these results suggest that , under certain conditions other lipid kinases may regulate macropinocytosis . A ‘macropinocytosis - like’ entry pathway has been invoked for IAV [ 45 (cid:2) ] . This dynamin - independent mech - anism is activated in A549 cells in the presence of serum . It has many of the properties of macropinocytosis ( Table 1 ) , but seems to be independent of Rac1 and Cdc42 , which play a central role in actin dynamics during macro - pinocytosis [ 69 , 70 ] . Inconsistent with the observed Rho GTPase - independence , the amiloride derivative EIPA , which inhibits activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 by altering submembranous pH [ 71 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] , effectively blocked IAV in - fection [ 45 (cid:2) ] . This suggests that EIPA has additional effects on the IAV lifecycle , or this virus relies on unde - ﬁned EIPA - sensitive Rho GTPases . The large , multi - functional GTPase dynamin - 2 can be inhibited by several drugs including dynasore and Dyn - go4a , or by overexpression of dominant negative forms of the protein [ 72 , 73 ] . Macropinocytosis of HIV - 1 ( in macro - phages ) , human rhinovirus - 14 ( HRV - 14 ) , and bluetongue virus - 1 ( BTV - 1 ) was inhibited by dynasore , and entry of human rhinovirus - 8 ( HRV - 8 ) by dynasore and the dyna - min - 2 dominant negative [ 53 – 55 , 67 ] . Although not required for lamellopodia - associated and bleb - associated macropinocytosis [ 13 , 52 , 74 ] , dynamin - 2 is needed for clo - sure of PDGF - stimulated circular rufﬂes [ 53 , 67 , 75 , 76 ] . This implies that the uptake of these viruses involves circular rufﬂing , but this needs to be conﬁrmed using live cell microscopy . It is worth noting that owing to side effects on the actin cytoskeleton and lamellipodia formation , dynasore should not be used as the sole criteria for deter - mining dynamin - dependence [ 77 ] . Taken together , these observations raise important questions . Are there endocytic mechanisms that have similarities to macropinocytosis but do not share the aspect of systemic activation and the formation of large ﬂuid - ﬁlled vacuoles ? How distinct is macropinocytosis from other clathrin - independent and caveolin - indepen - dent mechanisms ? How far does the plasticity of the systems reach when extended to different cells types and tissue architectures ? Macropinosome trafﬁcking Viruses internalized by clathrin mediated - endocytosis and caveolar / lipid raft - endocytosis are delivered to early endosomes . This is a sorting compartment from which a portion of the incoming ﬂuid and cargo is recycled back to the plasma membrane while some , including viruses , is targeted via multivesicular late endosomes to lysosomes for degradation . During movement into the perinuclear space and preparation for fusion with lysosomes , endo - somes undergo dramatic maturation [ 78 ] . This includes changes in the phosphoinositide content , the cohort of proteins that cover the cytoplasmic surface , the Rab proﬁle ( Rab5 to Rab7 switch ) , further acidiﬁcation , and formation of intralumenal vesicles ( Figure 2 and reviewed in [ 23 , 24 , 78 ] ) . Macropinosomes appear to undergo maturation as well ( details in Figure 2 ) . The main differences are that an initial sorting station comparable to early endosomes is apparently missing , the existence of a ‘maturing’ macro - pinosome that would contain both early and late macro - pinosome markers has not been described , and there is no evidence that macropinosome maturation involves the formation of intralumenal vesicles ( ILVs ) . After endocytosis , macropinosomes help to transport internalized viruses through the cortical cytoskeleton and cytoplasm while providing cues , such as low pH , to promote virus escape by membrane fusion . Many of the studies on macropinocytic entry of viruses have focused on the initial stages of uptake . Viruses are likely to serve as valuable tools for mapping later events in the pathway as well . Perspectives Interactions with cell surface factors and receptors deﬁne , to a large extent , the cell type and host species tropism of viruses , as well as the pathogenesis of viral diseases . It is therefore of utmost importance to analyze the initial interactions in detail and determine their consequences for the viruses and the cells . Here , we are dealing with a group of viruses that has evolved to exploit surface proteins that cells normally use as antennas for intercel - lular communication . By triggering their activation , the viruses turn on a complex , highly ampliﬁed downstream signaling cascade thus managing to induce dramatic glo - bal changes in cell behavior .

The main organelles of the classic endocytic pathway are early endosomes ( EEs ) , maturing endosomes ( MEs ) , late endosomes ( LEs ) , endolysosomes ( ELs ) , and lysosomes ( LYs ) . The maturation program of these organelles , their trafficking , and the fate of viruses that enter this network are relatively well defined ( reviewed in [ 24 ] ) . Although macropinosome trafficking differs with cell type and the triggering ligand , largely , macropinosomes appear to mature in a parallel fashion to classical endosomes . They undergo changes in their phosphoinositide make up , Rab GTPase components , pH , and position within the cell . Upon detachment , PI ( 3 ) K generates PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 on the newly formed early macropinosomes ( EMs ) [ 79 ] . Rab5 then accumulates together with its GEF , Rabex5 , and the effector Rabankyrin 5 [ 79 , 80 ] . In some cell types macropinosomes acquire Rab34 and EEA1 , which serve to mediate pinosome formation and homotypic fusion [ 81 , 82 ] . The action of sorting nexins ( SNX ) 1 and 5 , allows macropinosome cargo to be recycled or trafficked to EEs [ 63 – 66 ] . As macropinosomes move deeper into the cytoplasm they become late macropinosomes ( LMs ) , they undergo acidification , and acquire Rab7 and Rab21 [ 83 , 84 ] . While there is no consensus as to the final fate of LMs , at this stage they can fuse with each other , LEs , or LYs [ 83 , 85 , 86 ] by a process shown to rely on the lipid kinase activity of PIKfyve [ 87 (cid:2)(cid:2) ] . Current Opinion in Microbiology 2012 , 15 : 490 – 499 www . sciencedirect . com Our present understanding of macropinocytosis leaves open many questions both at the conceptual and the molecular level . For example , it would seem likely that such reprogramming would have other consequences that favor productive infection . Growth factors turn on the cell cycle , they induce changes in the cytoskeleton , and so on [ 8 ] . Does this help us to understand how viruses penetrate tissue barriers , as suggested by the work on coxsackie - virus B [ 88 ] ? By activating macropinocytosis , this virus triggers a dramatic change in cell architecture in order to infect otherwise impermeable epithelial cells . The sud - den internalization of large vacuoles and cargo induced by these viruses must have consequences for the entire endocytic network . Is this important for virus entry ? The adenovirus 2 data suggest that it does . Although these viruses enter by clathrin - mediated endocytosis , they have to induce parallel macropinocytosis for sub - sequent penetration [ 6 ] . The answers to these and many other questions will require careful analysis of virus cell interactions using molecular , cell biological , physiological , and systems - based approaches . The results will hopefully increase our understanding of viral diseases and provide strategies to prevent infection by turning off cellular responses that are so helpful to the viruses . In addition , through these studies it may be possible to make cells more amendable to uptake of therapeutic nanoparticles and drug delivery vehicles .
