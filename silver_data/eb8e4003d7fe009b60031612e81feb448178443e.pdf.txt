Here we focus on the convergence of product design schemes and put forward the extension case - based reasoning ( ECBR ) based on product semantic relevance . Through the semantic relevance function built , the method for goodness evaluation targeting the issue of convergence of product family comes into being . Finally , ECBR for the product function module is realized by relying on semantic relevance network and region relevance evaluation . 2 . Basic element representation of design process knowledge In extension theory , basic element unites quality and quantity and action and relation through a triplet consisting of object O , characteristic C and value V . By this means , the matters , affairs and relations are described in a formalized way . Basic element B is divided into matter element M , affair element A and relation element R , collectively expressed as Eq ( 1 ) ( ) 1 1 2 2 n n , , = O v v B O C V v       =         c c c ( 1 ) Basic element set { } S B = of product design is established to represent the quantitative and qualitative issues during the design process . Thus the innovation method and product design evaluation method are described intuitively . 3 . Convergence of design based on semantic relevance 3 . 1 Determination of evaluation indicators and weights Design goodness evaluation is performed for the conceptual product set { } S B = . First , the evaluation objective characteristic set ( ) 1 2 , , , m c c c c =  is defined along with the corresponding value ( ) 1 2 , , , m v v v v =  , where i i i v x V c = ⊂ （ ） and i V c （ ） is the value range of the evaluation objectives . Weight coefficient of the evaluation objective characteristic set 1 1 m α α α α =  （ ， ， ） is determined . The indicators that must be satisfied are denoted as Λ , i . e . r α = Λ , thus 1 1 m k kk r α = ≠ =  . The evaluation indicator set is constructed as { } 1 2 , , , m H H H H =  , where , 1 2 i i i H c v i m = =  （ ， ） ，， ， . 3 . 2 Construction of semantic relevance function For evaluation indicator set { } 1 2 , , , m H H H H =  , where , 1 2 i i i H c v i m = =  （ ， ） ，， ， , the corresponding weight coefficient 1 1 m α α α α =  （ ， ， ） , and the relevance function is established as 1 1 2 2 ( ) , ( ) , ( ) m m K x K x K x  . Three situations may apply to the relevance function thus built : If i V is a finite interval or an infinite interval , the simple correlation function is ( ) i i K x ; If i V is the set of discrete data { } 1 2 n b b b b =  ， ， ， , then Eq ( 2 ) 1 1 2 2 ( ) i i i i n i n a x b a x b K x a x b =  =  =  =   ， ， ， ( 2 ) If i V is the nested interval due to the mixing of the two situations above , the elementary dependent function is constructed . Consider the product family object p S and its subobject pj O . The correlation function of pj O with 1250 respect to the evaluation indicator i H is ( ) i pj K O ; the composite correlation function of product family object p S with respect to the evaluation indicator set is ( ) i p K S . The evaluation method for the product family taking p S as object is then constructed . According to the connotation of correlation function in conceptual design , the correlation degree represents the distance between the conceptual scheme and the i H value standard , which is divided into positive region ( 0 , ) + ∞ , critical point 0 and negative region ( , 0 ) −∞ . The mean ( ) E K denotes the value standard of the evaluation indicator . i K is standardized as Eq ( 3 ) : { 1 , 2 , , } ( ) , 1 , 2 , , , 1 , 2 , , , max ( ) p i pj ij p i po o n K O k i m j n K O ∈ = = =    ( 3 ) and the standardized correlation degree of subobject 1 2 , , , p p p pn O O O  in product family p S with respect to the evaluation indicator i H is ( ) 1 2 , , , 1 , 2 p i i i in k k k k i m = =   ， . The standardized correlation degree of object pj O with respect to evaluation indicator 1 2 , , , m H H H  is expressed as Eq ( 4 ) ( ) 1 2 , 1 , 2 , , j j pj p j k k K O j n k       = =           ( 4 ) 3 . 3 Goodness evaluation Goodness of conceptual product object pj O is denoted as ( ) pj C O . Goodness is calculated in three different ways . First , goodness can be calculated with composite correlation function as Eq ( 5 ) ( ) ( ) 1 2 1 1 1 j m j pj pj m i ij i j k k C O K O k k α α α α α =       = = =            （ ， ， ） ( 5 ) where 1 , 2 , , p j n =  . This method applies to multi - objective evaluation of most products . Goodness is taken as the minimum of the correlation function , ( ) 1 , 1 , 2 , , m pj ij p i C O k j n = = ∧ =  , which means that all characteristics of products being evaluated must be satisfied for a product to be qualified , regardless of weight . This typifies the “short - board effect” . Goodness is taken as the maximum of the correlation function , ( ) 1 , 1 , 2 , , m pj ij p i C O k j n = = ∨ =  , which means that only one characteristic need to be satisfied for a product to be qualified , regardless of weight . Computation of the goodness of a product family consists of the computation of the goodness of individual products and the overall goodness . If ( ) ( ) { } 0 { 1 , 2 , , } max p p pj j n C O C O ∈ =  , then individual object 0 p O is superior . The individual products can be ranked in descending order of goodness . Goodness ( ) 1 m pj i ij i Y C O k α = = =  of individual products in the product family is a discrete random variable . The maximum goodness of individual in the product family is taken as the standard goodness , denoted as Eq ( 6 ) ( ) ( ) ( ) { } 0 { 1 , 2 , , } max p p pj j n E Y C O C O ∈ = =  . ( 6 ) 1251 4 . A case of ECBR 4 . 1 Knowledge acquisition and representation We elaborate on the design of a machine tool as an application case . First of all , the basic element model of objectives based on users’ demand is constructed according to user knowledge : ( ) ( ) 0 4 5 6 , , 30 - 300 2000 1000 design parameters workpiece diameter distance between centers workpiece weight workpiece Rotational speed grinding wheel Specification Linear velocity of t B O C C O mm he grinding mm kg w V V V heel = ≤ ≤ = 7 8 9 Convex amount of grinding Concave amount of grinding Precisi V on V V                             The set of key characteristics in roll grinding machine case base is given in Table 1 .

Since a diversity of indicators are involved , the cases can be hardly differentiated in terms of superiority based on simple evaluation . Therefore , multi - level evaluation is adopted , which is to cluster 13 evaluation indicators on the basis of secondary evaluation into 4 groups of primary evaluation indicators . This forms the standard for the final goodness evaluation . The weights of each indicator are provided : 0 0 . 15 , 0 . 05 , 0 , 15 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 1 T α = ( ) ( 0 . 4 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 4 T a = ) The parameter estimates of the conceptual product MK8430 ( evaluation indicators ) are also given as ( 30 300 , 1 . 2 , 1200 , 2000 , 5 150 , 50040203 , 35 , 0 . 001 0 . 002 , 0 . 001 0 . 002 , 1 0 . . 1 , 0 . 002 , 0 . 2 2 , T Ra Ra H = − − ≤ ≤ ≤ − − ≤ （ ，， ） ） . 4 . 2 Relevance computation The results of relevance computation for the above case are shown in Table 2 . 1252 Table 2 : Standardized semantic relevance Weight Weight subdivision Standardized semantic relevance MK8420 MK8440 MK8450 MK8463 MK8463A MK8480 … 0 . 4 0 . 15 0 . 847 0 . 954 0 . 883 0 . 435 0 . 374 0 . 296 … 0 . 005 0 . 400 0 . 897 0 . 897 0 . 436 0 . 436 0 . 264 … 0 . 15 1 . 000 1 . 000 1 . 000 0 . 258 0 . 258 0 . 175 … 0 . 05 1 . 000 0 . 650 0 . 650 0 . 347 0 . 347 0 . 395 … 0 . 2 0 . 05 1 . 000 0 . 000 0 . 000 0 . 000 0 . 000 0 . 000 … 0 . 05 1 . 000 0 . 500 0 . 500 0 . 300 0 . 200 0 . 200 … 0 . 05 1 . 000 0 . 926 0 . 926 0 . 640 0 . 640 0 . 438 … 0 . 05 1 . 000 0 . 926 0 . 926 0 . 640 0 . 640 0 . 438 … 0 . 4 0 . 05 1 . 000 1 . 000 1 . 000 0 . 595 0 . 463 0 . 347 … 0 . 05 1 . 000 0 . 848 0 . 848 0 . 595 0 . 463 0 . 347 … 0 . 1 1 . 000 1 . 000 1 . 000 0 . 800 0 . 800 0 . 800 … 0 . 1 1 . 000 1 . 000 1 . 000 0 . 800 0 . 800 0 . 800 … 0 . 1 1 . 000 1 . 000 1 . 000 0 . 800 0 . 800 0 . 800 … The relevance of primary level evaluation is determined based on the standardized correlation of secondary level evaluation . 1 0 . 329 0 . 330 0 . 319 0 . 123 0 . 114 0 . 092 0 . 200 0 . 118 0 . 118 0 . 079 0 . 074 0 . 054 0 . 400 0 . 392 0 . 392 0 . 300 0 . 286 0 . 275 R K     =          The composite relevance of evaluation is ( ) 0 . 929 0 . 840 0 . 829 0 . 502 0 . 475 0 . 420 K =  . Thus product family 1 S of roll grinding machine is selected for the extension case , i . e . workpiece moving - CNC roll grinding machine MK8420 , MK8440 and MK8450 . In product family 1 S , MK8420 has the highest relevance . As analyzed above , product family 1 S is chosen as the general module , and the machine tool module configuration scheme is formulated . Production family 1 S of workpiece moving - CNC roll grinding machine consists of products with mature modularization ( see Figure . 1 ) . Figure 1 : Workpiece moving - CNC roll grinding machine modules 5 . Conclusions We propose the method of semantic relevance - based convergence method aiming at CBR for product design . The empirical approach for product case selection in conventional product design process is adopted and integrated with the formalized and quantitative approach so as to achieve CBR . Starting from the perspectives of product semantics and basic element model in extension theory , the method for semantic relevance evaluation oriented towards the product family is established . For the design of machine tool , the design issue is formalized , and the user semantic is transformed into design semantic . The reference product or product family is selected by semantic relevance computation , and CBR is performed for the modules constituting the conceptual product using region relevance and semantic network . The case has verified the feasibility of the convergence method based on semantic relevance . Moreover , we present a method that integrates formalization and quantification of knowledge for the early stage of conceptual product design . Some further 1253 studies are required with respect to the application in the refined structural design , specifically , ECBR in refined structural design and in product appearance design .
