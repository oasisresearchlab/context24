Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) Imaging , MR based diﬀusion measurements and MR Elastography ( MRE ) are considered sensitive to the microstructure of tissues including collagen networks of the ECM . However , little is known whether water diﬀusion interacts with viscoelastic properties of tissues . This study combines highfield MR based diﬀusion measurements , novel compact tabletop MRE and confocal microscopy in collagen networks of diﬀerent cross - linking states ( untreated collagen gels versus additional treatment with glutaraldehyde ) . The consistency of bulk rheology and MRE within a wide dynamic range is demonstrated in heparin gels , a viscoelastic standard for MRE . Additional crosslinking of collagen led to an 8 - fold increased storage modulus , a 4 - fold increased loss modulus and a significantly decreased power law exponent , describing multi - relaxational behavior , corresponding to a pronounced transition from viscous - soft to elastic - rigid properties . Collagen network changes were not detectable by MR based diﬀusion measurements and microscopy which are sensitive to the micrometer scale . The MRE - measured shear modulus is sensitive to collagen fiber interactions which take place on the intrafiber level such as fiber stiﬀness . The insensitivity of MR based diﬀusion measurements to collagen hydrogels of diﬀerent cross - linking states alludes that congeneric collagen structures in connective tissues do not hinder extracellular diﬀusive water transport . Furthermore , the glutaraldehyde induced rigorous changes in viscoelastic properties indicate that intrafibrillar dissipation is the dominant mode of viscous dissipation in collagen - dominated connective tissue . Introduction Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) properties determine the micro - environment in which cells survive , grow and migrate , and influence chemical and mechanical signalling pathways . 1 – 5 In vivo characterization of ECM properties by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) requires quantitative imaging methods sensitive to biophysical tissue interactions which occur on micro - scales and which can normally not be resolved by in vivo imaging methods . 6 MR based diﬀusion measurements , such as diﬀusion weighted imaging ( DWI ) , and magnetic resonance elastography ( MRE ) are known to be sensitive to the microstructure of biological tissues by measurement of water transport and viscoelastic behaviour , respec - tively . Water diﬀusion quantified by MR based diﬀusion measure - ments has many clinical applications including the detection of ischemic lesions , nerve fiber tracking or tumor characterization 7 – 10 and has also been reported to be to some extent sensitive to the microstructure of collagen gels . 11 In contrast to other techniques used to characterize the diffusive properties of ECM - like networks , such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) , MR based diffusion measurements are not dependent on small fluorescent mole - cules and optically accessible sample geometry .

Densely packed structures that contain predominantly cells such as neuronal 21 or muscle tissues 22 clearly demonstrate restricted water diﬀusion . Nevertheless , DWI has recently been proposed as a surrogate marker of tissue stiﬀness in the fibrotic liver . 23 , 24 Vice versa , MRE has been paired with diﬀusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) for the measurement of anisotropic stiﬀness along fiber pathways . 25 This study addresses MR based collagen network characterization by MRE and MR based diﬀusion measurements . In biophysics collagen - based hydrogels have been established as scaﬀolds for investigating 3D cell – matrix interactions , 26 due to their physio - logic relevance as well as tunability and adaptability . Their unique mechanical properties arising from intrinsic crosslinks prominent to a certain extent in native gels . 27 In more detail , intermolecular as well as intra - and intermicrofibrillar cross - links are formed by aldehyde groups created by the conversion of specific lysine and hydroxylysine residues to peptide bound aldehydes by lysyloxydase . 28 In this study , we are using a well - established ECM model system 29 – 31 consisting of collagen gels produced from a mixture of type 1 bovine skin and type 1 rat tail collagen in order to simulate the ECM of human connective tissue . 32 To mimic fibrosis induced tissue stiffening additional collagen crosslinking is induced by glutaraldehyde ( GA ) treatment . 33 The idea dates back to the 60ies where it has been shown that GA shows the best efficiency regarding chemical and thermal stability . 34 GA reacts primarily with amino groups of proteins . Since the gap between these amine groups on adjacent fiber or fiber bundle surfaces is too large to be bridged by GA crosslinks the additional crosslinks are mostly introduced within fibers rather than in between fibers , 35 indicating that the crosslinking of directly touching fibers such as knots or decussating fibers might be possible . The current techniques to characterize the viscoelastic behaviour of collagen networks have some disadvantages . The gold standard plate rheology requires relatively large samples , can be hampered by surface artefacts and is very difficult to use for combination studies with live cells . 36 AFM - based microrheology can only probe the surface of the network . 37 For microrheological approaches it still remains unclear how the shear modulus can be quantitatively extracted . 38 , 39 MRE is ideally suited to precisely measure the shear modulus deep in the bulk of a collagen network . We will use a compact table - top MRE device which has advantages concerning ease of cost and use and allows stiffness measurements which can be related to results reported for in vivo tissue . Since our MRE console operates above the frequency range of conventional oscillatory rheology we are using heparin gel phantoms to demon - strate the consistency of both methods . In contrast to traditional phantoms such as ultrasound gels , heparin gel as a pharma - ceutical is superior regarding reproducibility and international comparability and has thus already been used as viscoelastic phantom material in MRE for hardware calibration and model fitting . 40 , 41 Its properties are characterized by a viscoelastic power law behavior characteristic for multi - relaxational materials and can thus better simulate biological tissue properties than pure rubber - like materials . 42 , 43 We have conducted small - sample MRE tests for the visco - elastic characterization of prototypical diﬀerently strong cross - linked collagen networks , combined with MR based diﬀusion measurements and confocal microscopy as well as pore size analysis of the networks . Our aim is to quantify parameter changes in MRE and MR based diﬀusion measurements under well - controlled conditions and to identify the length scale of structural changes in model collagen networks to which both modalities are sensitive . Methods Collagen gel preparation & additional crosslinking The collagen gels were made by a mixture of bovine skin type 1 and rat tail type 1 ( 2 : 1 ) collagen which mimics ECM properties of human connective tissue . 32 Collagen gel concentration was 3 mg ml (cid:2) 1 . For the preparation of 1 ml gel , 0 . 25 ml of rat tail collagen type 1 ( 4 mg ml (cid:2) 1 , Lot # 161088 , Serva , Heidelberg , Germany ) and 0 . 5 ml of bovine skin collagen type 1 ( 4 mg ml (cid:2) 1 , Lot # 0606E , Biochrom , Berlin , Germany ) were mixed with a phosphate buﬀer solution consisting of 171 m l 1 M disodium hydrogen phosphate ( Na 2 HPO 4 ) , 50 m l dH 2 O and 29 m l 1 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate ( NaH 2 PO 4 (cid:3) H 2 O ) to set the final pH value to 7 . 4 . 29 , 44 To inhibit gel polymerization during preparation pre - cooled solutions were used and the mixing was done on ice . Pipetted into a pre - cooled carrier of choice the collagen solution was immediately transferred to an incubator for polymerization at 37 1 C and 95 % humidity for 1 . 5 hours . Afterwards , the polymerized gels were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated overnight also with PBS . 29 Additional network crosslinking was carried out according to Lang et al . 2015 33 by adding 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde solution ( diluted in PBS , stock 25 % , Serva , Heidelberg , Germany ) to the polymerized gels for 1 hour , followed by 12 consecutive washing steps with PBS over the next 24 hours . Confocal microscopy & pore size analysis The gels were polymerized as described above in a 24 Well m - Plate ( ibidi , Martinsried , Germany ) . Afterwards , the gels were stained overnight with a 10 m g ml (cid:2) 1 5 - ( and - 6 ) - carboxytetramethyl - rhodamine , succinimidyl ester ( TAMRA - SE ) solution , followed by three rinsing steps with PBS . Imaging was done with a confocal Paper Soft Matter O p e n A cce ss A r ti c l e . P ub li s h e d on 20 M a r c h 2019 . D o w n l o a d e d on 8 / 26 / 2019 7 : 14 : 18 A M .

Confocal stacks were recorded with a HC PL APO CS2 40 (cid:4) / 1 . 10 WATER objective ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) with water immersion under illumination of a 561 nm DPSS - laser . The total stack dimensions were ( 151 . 99 (cid:4) 151 . 99 (cid:4) 177 . 57 ) m m 3 consisting of 402 slices with 2024 (cid:4) 2024 pixels resolution . The Leica Application Suite X ( 3 . 1 . 5 . 16308 , Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) was used as recording and image displaying software . Image stacks were taken at least 50 m m above the bottom of the gels and 5 diﬀerent stacks were taken for the untreated and GA treated collagen gels each around the center position of diﬀerent wells . All images were deconvoluted with Huygens Essential ( v . 16 . 10 , Scientific Volume Imaging , The Netherlands ) using the ‘‘Huygens essential automatic , best resolution’’ approach . After the deconvolution the pixel size in xy - direction could be reduced by a factor of 4 to achieve faster computing without sacrificing the quality of the outcome . The three - dimensional ( 3D ) pore size , a robust measure to describe gel topology , 45 was determined by using an improved 3D implementation of Bubble Analysis . 46 To overcome light absorption and diﬀraction of the very large image volumes , we first denoised each image plane separately using total variation denoising 47 and binarized the confocal images per plane using an adaptive local threshold and morphological operations to refine the binarization . Subsequently , local maxima of a Euclidean Distance Transform were determined , representing 3D pore location and radii , displaying the mesh size of the collagen gels . Tabletop MRE A tabletop MRI scanner ( Pure Devices GmbH , Wu¨rzburg , Germany ) with a 10 mm bore and 0 . 5 T permanent magnet was customized by addition of an external gradient amplifier ( DC 600 , Pure Devices GmbH , Wu¨rzburg , Germany ) and an integrated MRI system - controlled piezoelectric driver ( Piezosystem Jena , Jena , Germany ) . The piezoelectric driver ( + , 20 mm ; length , 72 mm ) was fed with a sinusoidal alternating current from the gradient amplifier covering a frequency range from 200 and 5700 Hz . Glass tubes ( untreated soda - lime glass , + , 8 . 0 mm ; length , 15 cm ) were coupled onto the piezoelectric driver from their topside and were sealed at the bottom with a PVC - plug containing an additional NB70 - rubber sealing ring . A disk ( R = 4 . 0 mm , thickness = 1 mm ) of closed cell PVC foam was fixated on top of the bottom plug , functioning as a shock absorber to decouple the sample from vibrations of the sample holder bottom to enable wave excitations originating only from the sides of the glass tube into the sample . The vibrations inside the glass cylinder were polarized along the main axis of the tube due to the constrained axial motion direction of the actuator . The amplitude of the piezoelectric driver was adjusted for each measured frequency that the resulting peak strain was always between 1 % and 2 % , ensuring linear collagen displacements . An overview over the setup and the sample geometry is depicted in Fig . 3a and b respectively . 500 m l of the actual sample was filled in the tubes from the top resulting in a sample height of 11 mm . To avoid premature collagen fibrillation and fiber alignment by flow the sample holders were cooled down in an ice bath during the filling process . The tubes were sealed against evaporation with foam plugs at the top . The tabletop scanner has an inbuilt temperature control which held the sample constantly at 37 1 C during the measurements . Driving frequencies ranged from 200 – 800 Hz for untreated and from 200 – 2000 Hz for GA treated collagen samples . The range of frequencies was adapted for each sample to meet the resolution requirements of the shear wave . The upper frequency limit related to the image resolution . Given a spatial resolution of 0 . 15 mm over 8 . 0 mm diameter of the sample provided 53 pixels of support for a full wave profile . This resolution supported the shortest wavelengths of at least 0 . 6 mm , assuming that four voxels were necessary to accurately fit a complex sine function to a discrete waveform . This limit is still several magnitudes over the characteristic length scale of collagen gels , e . g . persistence length 48 and pore size ( see results ) , ensuring the measurement of bulk properties . In the low frequency range , the largest wavelength to be properly resolved was on the order of the sample diameter ( i . e . , 8 . 0 mm ) . For each sample the viscoelastic dispersion function was acquired with at least seven frequencies . Imaging sequence , acquisition parameters and post processing were identical to the method explained in greater detail in a previous publication . 19 In brief , data acquisition was carried out twice at each frequency and averaged , resulting in a total acquisition time for a single frequency of 22 . 6 min . The samples were imaged using the following acquisition parameters : repetition time = 2000 ms , echo time = 42 ms , slice thickness = 3 mm , matrix size = 64 (cid:4) 64 , field of view = ( 9 . 6 (cid:4) 9 . 6 ) mm 2 , voxel size = ( 0 . 15 (cid:4) 0 . 15 (cid:4) 3 ) mm 3 . The acquired phase data were unwrapped and Fourier - transformed in time to extract complex - valued wave images at driving frequency f ( Fig . 3d and e ) . All data points of the z - deflection ( parallel to the cylinder axis ) were mapped onto cylindrical coordinates and averaged over the azimuthal angle , yielding a single profile along the radial coordinate ( Fig . 3f and g ) . The resulting profiles were fitted by the analytical solution of shear waves in a z - infinite cylinder 49 , 50 as described previously , 19 where the Bessel function of first kind yields the desired result of the fit , the complex wave number k * = k 0 + i k 00 . As described by Tzscha¨tzsch et al . , 51 we translated k * into two real - valued quantities related to elastic stiﬀness ( shear wave speed c ) and inverse attenuation ( shear wave penetration rate a ) , both in the dimension of m s (cid:2) 1 : c ¼ o k 0 and a ¼ (cid:2) o 2 p k 00 ( 1 ) where o is the angular driving frequency equal to 2 p f . As described in a previous study , 19 we directly fitted c and a by a viscoelastic model to derive shear modulus - related para - meters instead of first calculating a complex shear modulus G * from k * and then fitting G * . We chose this approach because c and a are the primary results of the Bessel fit instead of G * , which is normally obtained from direct inversion - based MRE . Our model of choice was the fractional element ( FE ) , which predicts a monotonic increase in storage and loss modulus over the full frequency range based on only two parameters : m ( shear modulus in the dimension kPa ) and a ( dimensionless power Soft Matter Paper O p e n A cce ss A r ti c l e .

Based on a fractal ladder and introduced by Helmut Schiessel and Alexander Blumen in 1996 52 it has among others shown applicability to describe the frequency dependent rheological behavior of eukaryotic cells . 42 In this model the complex shear modulus G * = G 0 + i G 00 is described as : 13 G (cid:5) ¼ m 1 (cid:2) a Z a ð i o Þ a ¼ m 1 (cid:2) a Z a o a cos p 2 a (cid:2) (cid:3) þ isin p 2 a (cid:2) (cid:3) h i ( 2 ) with the independent variables m and a as well as the dependent variable Z , which is known a priori as viscosity of the material or set to 1 Pa s as done in this study .

MRE To validate our tabletop MRE device against standard plate rheology heparin gel ( Heparin Ratiopharm 180000 Gel , Ratiopharm , Ulm , Germany ) with known viscoelastic power law properties 40 , 41 was used . This gel consists mostly of Carbomer 980 ( polyacrylic acid ) , trometamol ( TRIS ) , macrogol glycerolhydroxystearate , propylene glycol and isopropanol with the eponymous active agent only accounting for less than 1 % of the gel volume . MRE experiments were performed with the same sample geometry , measurement protocol and processing steps as explained above . The range of driving frequencies was 120 – 2000 Hz . For the shear rheology experiments an Anton Paar Physica MCR301 ( Anton Paar GmbH , Graz , Austria ) rheometer with plate – plate configuration ( diameter = 50 mm , gap height = 2 mm ) was used . The frequency sweeps at 2 % strain covered a range from 0 . 5 – 80 Hz . Data evaluation was done on - site with the software Rheoplus v . 3 . 40 ( Anton Paar GmbH , Graz , Austria ) . MR based diﬀusion study Diﬀusion measurements were performed by means of pulsed field gradient ( PFG ) 1 H NMR using a 100 MHz spectrometer equipped with a homebuilt PFG unit allowing for the application of strong gradient pulses with the intensities g up to 35 T m (cid:2) 1 and diﬀusion times t d as low as 1 ms . 53 , 54 The measurements were conducted with a 13 - interval pulse sequence ( see Fig . 2a ) permitting for an eﬃcient compensation of the disturbing eddy currents upon the application of the strong magnetic field gradient pulses . 55 Typical parameters of the pulse sequence were : t = 2 ms for the separation between the p / 2 and p pulses , D = 10 ms for the separation between the p / 2 pulses defining the diﬀusion time t d , d = 300 m s for the duration of the gradient pulses . The temperature of the measurements was set to ( 25 (cid:6) 0 . 1 ) 1 C . The NMR spin echo signal intensities were measured for diﬀerent values of b , where b = g 2 g 2 d 2 t d with g = 2 . 67 (cid:4) 10 8 T (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 being the gyromagnetic ratio and t d = D + 7 t / 2 + d / 6 is the diﬀusion time of the 13 - interval pulse sequence . Our experiments were performed with three diﬀerent diﬀusion times : 10 ms , 40 ms and 160 ms . The spin - echo signals S ( b ) , attenuated due to diﬀusion in the presence of the inhomogeneous magnetic field ( g = d B / d z ) , were measured by incrementing the linear gradient intensity and by keeping all other parameters of the pulse sequence constant . The apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcients ( ADC ) of our samples were conventionally obtained as a slope of ln ( S ( b ) ) plotted vs . diﬀerent b values . The typical precision of the ADC determination is less than 5 % . With obtained ADC and given t d the diﬀusion length l d can be calculated according to l d ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ADC (cid:3) t d p . Results No visible diﬀerences in network architecture and in particular pore size , i . e . mesh size , can be detected in the cLSM image stacks of untreated and GA treated collagen gels ( Fig . 1a and b ) . An analysis covering more than 22 . 000 pores from 5 diﬀerent samples for each untreated and GA treated collagen revealed that the average pore size ( mean (cid:6) SD ) of the gels after glutaraldehyde treatment is with ( 4 . 44 (cid:6) 1 . 46 ) m m almost identical as without glutaraldehyde treatment ( 4 . 58 (cid:6) 1 . 50 ) m m . Thus , diﬀerences in the mechanical behavior between GA treated and untreated samples can be only due to changes in inter - as well as intra - fiber cross - linking and a consequential increase in filament bending stiﬀness . Fig . 2b displays the signal intensities obtained for diﬀerent b values at the diﬀusion times t d indicated in the inset for a typical normalized spin - echo attenuation . The linearity of the plots in Fig . 2b and the independence from the diﬀusion time reveals that normal diﬀusion occurs , meaning the mean - squared - displacements growing linearly with diﬀusion time . ADCs obtained for all samples are shown in Table 1 and reveal that ADCs of water in untreated and GA treated collagen gels have no significant diﬀerence . Three diﬀerent samples were measured for each type , where the untreated collagen gels have an ADC of ( 2 . 133 (cid:6) 0 . 062 ) (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 3 mm 2 s (cid:2) 1 , and the glutaraldehyde treated samples have an ADC of ( 2 . 173 (cid:6) 0 . 094 ) (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 3 mm 2 s (cid:2) 1 . Since the concentration of collagen responsible for the creation of the open pored network only accounts for approx . 0 . 3 % of the sample volume it is not unexpected that the measured ADCs were very close to the unhindered diﬀusion in pure samples of water ( 2 . 5 (cid:6) 0 . 1 ) (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 3 mm 2 s (cid:2) 1 , PBS ( 2 . 4 (cid:6) 0 . 1 ) (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 3 mm 2 s (cid:2) 1 or the 200 mM buﬀer solution that was used during the preparation of the collagen gels ( 2 . 3 (cid:6) 0 . 1 ) (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) 3 mm 2 s (cid:2) 1 . The obtained diﬀusion lengths l d were in the range from 4 . 6 m m to 18 . 6 m m and thus larger than the average pore size of the gels . Together with measured ADCs close to bulk proper - ties this alludes to unhindered water diﬀusion in our samples .

An overview of wave images of untreated and GA treated collagen gels obtained with the table top MRE device at multiple frequencies is shown in Fig . 3d and e .

This can be clearly seen by comparing the wave images at 400 Hz for the untreated and the GA treated collagen gel . The untreated collagen gel has a wavelength of approx . 1 . 1 mm , whereas the treated gel has a wavelength of approx . 2 . 7 mm . The wave speed c and the penetration rate a were obtained from the Bessel fits at individual frequencies for untreated ( Fig . 4a ) and GA treated collagen gels ( Fig . 4b ) . The dashed lines in Fig . 4a and b represent the FE fits for c ( f ) and a ( f ) according to eqn ( 4 ) . Glutaraldehyde treatment fixes a sample , i . e . it drastically strengthens intrafilament connections and crosslinks . Consequentially , this freezes out relaxation through internal dynamics . The multi - relaxational FE model does not fit as well to rubber - elastic permanently crosslinked polymer gels which also explains the deviations between FE - model ( dashed line ) and data in Fig . 4b and why the frequency dependent behavior of these samples is better fitted by a Kelvin – Voigt model 57 ( solid line ) , for which the complex shear modulus is derived as : G * = m + i Zo ( 5 ) with the independent variables m and Z . The FE fit results for the untreated collagen samples were m = ( 35 . 2 (cid:6) 4 . 9 ) Pa and a = ( 0 . 380 (cid:6) 0 . 021 ) while treatment with glutaraldehyde increased m to ( 1032 (cid:6) 84 ) Pa and decreased a to ( 0 . 123 (cid:6) 0 . 018 ) . These changes in m and a correlate with the static rigidification of the collagen network . The results for the KV fit for GA treated collagen were m = ( 1 . 33 (cid:6) 0 . 18 ) kPa and Z = ( 0 . 068 (cid:6) 0 . 016 ) Pa s . The storage and loss moduli depicted in Fig . 4c and d are calculated directly from eqn ( 3 ) and thus not aﬀected by the parameters of any fit model . The change from a softer , liquid state to a more elastic , rigid state is reflected by storage modulus G 0 and loss modulus G 00 averaged over all measured frequencies showing an 8 - fold increase for the GA treated samples ( 155 (cid:6) 22 ) Pa to ( 1032 (cid:6) 84 ) Pa in G 0 while only a 4 - fold increase from ( 113 (cid:6) 24 ) Pa to ( 447 (cid:6) 210 ) Pa in G 00 . The results are summarized in Table 2 . Discussion Here we demonstrate that tabletop MRE can be an important extension to classical rheological measurements and represents an easy - to - use alternative while accessing a frequency spectrum above the range of conventional plate rheology . It overcomes the diﬃculty of inadequate coupling between sample and plate by polymerizing the sample directly inside the sample holder and reflecting the coupling quality in the recorded wave images ( see Fig . 3d and e ) . The sample environment of the tabletop MRE avoids in particular problems typical for biological samples such as sample evaporation at physiological temperatures or protein denaturation at the air – water interface and enables long - term measurements of viscoelastic bulk properties under physiological conditions . In the future , our approach will be essential to solve the enigma of rheological measurements in biological cells and tissues . The results obtained by diﬀerent state - of - the - art techniques can diﬀer by several orders of magnitude . 58 , 59 MRE can be readily performed in vivo and the observed rheological behavior can be cross checked by plate rheology using suitable MRE phantoms . In polymer physics the viscous part of viscoelastic behavior is greatly attributed to intrafibrillar dissipation and hydrodynamic drag with even minimal amounts of untangled polymers signifi - cantly changing viscoelastic properties . 60 Assuming suﬃcient polymer concentration and coupling with the solvent , the latter can be reflected in altered diﬀusive behavior of the solvent molecules . Thus , a combination of MR based diﬀusion measurements and MRE is an ideal research tool to investigate to what extent hydrodynamics contributes to viscous dissipation in soft matter . Our tabletop device technologically permits to combine simul - taneous MR based diﬀusion and MRE measurements . In dilute solutions of conventional flexible polymers , the increase in viscosity with respect to the pure solvent is attributed to dissipation of the polymer’s Brownian motion through hydro - dynamic drag . This means that there is a frictional coupling between solvent and collagen filaments . According to free volume models 61 increasing polymer concentration will eventually hinder free solvent diﬀusion . Our results for collagen networks clearly show that water diﬀusion remains unhindered by the presence of collagen fibers . This is not surprising considering the large pore size and the low volume fraction that collagen fibers take up and is in accordance with the dilute regime from aforementioned free volume models . While other techniques such as FRAP and FCS were able to detect hindered diﬀusion in dense collagen - based structures in dependency of the probe size , 62 , 63 the reliance of these techniques on optically accessible slices for the fluorescent probes and the diﬀerent corresponding ADC regimes renders them to be hardly comparable to MR based diﬀusion measurements in bulk materials . However , a possible extension of our current experiments would be to use our combination to measure denser ECM sub - stitutes ( i . e . centrifuged or artificially aligned collagen samples ) with an increased amount of biological or trapped water to identify multiple diﬀerent diﬀusion timescales as has been demonstrated before on Amyloid Fibrils . 64 From a biological perspective , a regulated extracellular diﬀusive transport is essential for morphogen gradients to facilitate correct embryonal development , while under hin - dered nutrient flow solid tumors develop necrotic cores . The semiflexible nature of collagen networks , i . e . filament stiﬀness , assures that connective tissue can be mechanically stable and strong as well as simultaneously provide a large pore size that does not hinder diﬀusive transport .

It is essential for connective tissue to protect from mechanical trauma by viscous dissipation . This dampening cannot be caused by the hydrodynamic drag of the polymer strands through the surrounding solvent . It can only be caused by internal dynamics of the collagen fibers themselves . In our experiments the GA treatment fixes the filaments and thus freezes intrafibrillar motions in the filaments 66 – 68 which ultimately leads to a loss of Fig . 4 Shear wave speed c and shear wave penetration rate a plotted over frequency for an untreated ( a ) and a GA treated ( b ) collagen gel . Presented data is each from one single measurement and representative FE fits ( dashed lines ) and an additional fit based on the Kelvin – Voigt model ( KV fit , solid line ) for GA treated collagen demonstrate the GA induced changes . Model independent storage ( G 0 ) and loss modulus ( G 00 ) obtained from eqn ( 3 ) vs . frequency for the collagen samples before ( c ) and after ( d ) additional glutaraldehyde treatment show the transition from a softer liquid power law behavior to a solid elastic rubber plateau . The fits are from the same nature as in ( a ) and ( b ) . The displayed data shows the mean + SD ( shaded regions ) for N = 7 individual samples for each condition .

Our findings convincingly demonstrate that the combination of MR based diﬀusion measurements and MRE can be a power - ful tool in polymer and biophysics . We have shown that MRE is sensitive to viscoelastic alterations in low - volume fraction hydrogel networks while MR based diﬀusion measurements are known to be sensitive to restricted diﬀusion in cellular systems . Therefore , our experimental approach permits combined studies on how the water diﬀusion in ECM - like networks is influenced by interspersed objects that hinder or restrict water diﬀusion ( e . g . cells , spheroids , beads ) while simultaneously measuring the eﬀects on the visco - elastic properties of the samples via MRE . Furthermore , the experimental roadmap presented in this study can be easily transferred to other hydrogel systems of interest in polymer physics , such as F - actin and other cytoskeletal filaments . Finally , the combi - nation of the presented techniques seems to be suitable for the in vivo characterization of both viscoelastic and diﬀusion related properties of tumors and their surrounding microenvironment .
