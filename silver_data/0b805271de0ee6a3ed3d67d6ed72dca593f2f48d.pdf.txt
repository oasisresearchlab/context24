The study uses Consensus ( C ) as the control . The main objectives were to investigate the development , management and productivity of conflicts . It thus extends the earlier studies on DA and DI from the manual group work to the computer aided group work . 20 groups , involving 116 students , participated in this study . A factorial design was used where each group achieved consensus decisions on two separate tasks . The process of Decision Conferencing was used to help the groups in arriving at the decision . The results are mixed . It was found that , in terms of generating conflicts there were no differences among DI , DA and C groups . For the conflict management strategies , however , DI and DA groups used less avoidance strategies than the C groups . The study also did not find any differences among DI , DA and C in terms of the productivity of conflict . It was , however , observed that task type plays an important role and future studies on GDSS should , therefore , be aimed at dealing with multiple tasks . 1 . INTRODUCTION Organizational decision making are complicated by a number of factors . Topping the list are considerations for : multiple criteria , uncertainty , and group decision making . Traditionally , a single criterion was the basis for economic decision making , for example utility maximizing behaviour of consumer and profit maximizing behaviour of firm . However for effective organizational decision making one needs to consider more than one criteria . Survey [ Bilkey 1973 ] has shown that beside making profit a firm may have other criteria as : provide good product , expand market share , influence price , influence power , benefit community etc . It is these multiplicity of criteria / objectives / goals which make organizational decision making challenging . Uncertainty has plagued decision making since the beginning of human civilization . As business environment becomes more complex ( competitive , global etc . ) uncertainty becomes even more prevalent in organizational decision making . It is wellknown that most organizational decisions are undertaken by groups [ Hackathorn & Keen 1981 ] . Group decision making involves two or more people who are jointly responsible for finding solution to an organizational problem . Unique characteristic of group decision making is the group interaction which might result in conflict among the group members . Research on group decision making is not new . Arrow [ 1963 ] has pioneered the systematic study on the group decision making ( GDM ) and introduced his famous ( im ) possibility theorem . With the maturity of technology GDM has taken a new turn when Group Decision Support Systems ( GDSS ) was introduced in 1980s [ Jessup & Valacich 1993 ] . GDSSs are computer based information systems used to support the intellectual , goal directed group work [ Jessup & Valacich 1993 ] . Various levels of GDSS have been suggested in the literature [ DeSanctis & Gallupe 1987 ] . Main purpose of all these is to provide a form of structure in GDM . This structure may come in different form : in manual or computer - aided communication support , in some form of computer aided modelling , or in the group decision process ( i . e . structured procedure ) . Many GDSSs mostly introduce structure in all of them [ Jessup & Valacich 1993 , Bostrom et al . 1992 ] . While GDSSs may not go through the 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 2 rigorous group decision making process of Arrow [ 1963 ] they nonetheless have demonstrated potential benefits [ Bostrom et al 1992 , Dennis et al . 1988 , Valacich et al . 1994 ; among others ] . This paper addresses a type of GDSS where the primary focus is to develop an on - line group model to structure the organizational problem at hand . Widely known as “Decision Conferencing” [ Quaddus et al 1992 , Vari and Vecsenyi 1992 ] , it uses a single PC ( and therefore non - networked ) which is operated by an analyst whose primary job is to capture the group deliberations in order to develop the group decision model . The meeting is facilitated by a trained facilitator whose main job is to keep the group task focused and help create an environment conducive to a productive group session . Although hundreds of Decision Conferences have been conducted world wide , only a handful have been reported in the literature , primarily due to the proprietary nature of the case applications . For example , 32 Decision Conferences have been conducted at the Curtin University , Western Australia , by the end of 1994 . But only one has been reported in the literature [ Quaddus et al . 1992 ] . 1 . 1 Conflict and Decision Conferencing Group work of any kind creates conflict . According to Rahim [ 1986 ] , conflict should not be reduced , eliminated or avoided , but properly targeted and managed . An absence of conflict can lead to groupthink - a phenomenon detrimental to effective decision making , in which one or more group members are compelled subconsciously to conform to the mode of thinking of the majority group members . On the other hand , inappropriate or poorly managed conflict is also dysfunctional . It inhibits effective problem solving , results in participants’ dissatisfaction with the process and outcomes , and can lead to the disintegration of the group [ Rahim 1986 ] . Being more people centered [ Phillips 1989 ] conflict in Decision Conferencing is even more prevalent . The steps of Decision Conferencing ( see below ) reveal the possibility of conflict generation clearly . The process of the Decision Conference starts with pre - conference preparation , which includes visiting the client organization and finding out the problem to be dealt with , the decision making group , its composition , history etc . In the next stage the group is invited to take part in the Decision Conference , the steps of which are [ Phillip 1988 ] : ( i ) Problem Statement , ( ii ) Identifying the current situation with respect to the problem , ( iii ) Identifying the desired future which the organization wants to achieve within a given time frame ( 3 - 5 years ) , ( iv ) Developing possible strategies to take the organization from the current situation to the desired future , ( v ) Finding the attributes that are seen as distinguishing among the strategies ( hence develop the group decision model ) , ( vi ) Assessing the parameters of the model , ( vii ) Exploring the model and performing a variety of sensitivity analyses , and ( viii ) Planing the implementation . All of these steps are performed in an open face - to - face discussions among the group members . It is evident from the above steps that chances of conflict development are enormous in the Decision Conference , the management of which is of paramount importance . Various authors [ McCartt and Rohrbaugh [ 1989 ] , Quaddus et al . [ 1992 ] , and Vari and Vecsenyi [ 1992 ] ; among many others ] have also demonstrated conflict in Decision Conferencing over the years and argued that conflict and its proper management are primary ingredients of Decision Conferencing success . Although conflict seems to be a major issue in Decision Conferencing , very little systematic study has been devoted to it . Pervan & Atkinson [ 1995 ] also found a general lack of research in non - networked GDSS including Decision Conferencing . The authors claimed that the focus of research in GDSS was primarily on human behaviour and found no studies on conflict and conflict management in Decision Conferencing . Very recently Quaddus et al . [ 1997 ] reported an experimental research on the impact of Decision Conferencing on conflict and its management . The authors investigated how various tasks interact with the Decision Conferencing process in the development and management of conflict . The authors found the evidence of more issue based conflict than interpersonal conflict [ Miranda & Bostrom 1993 ] in Decision Conferencing , however they were not significantly different from the manual process . However task played a significant role in the generation and management of conflict [ Quaddus et al 1997 ] . This study , however , looked into the natural conflict generation during the Decision Conferencing and the corresponding manual process . For proper introduction and management of conflict , researchers over the years have primarily dealt with two types of structured conflict generation techniques as Devil’s Advocacy ( DA ) and Dialectical Inquiry ( DI ) [ Mason 1969 , Schweiger et al . 1986 , Schwenk 1983 , Schwenk 1990 ] . In DI a plan is developed and presented under some explicit set of assumptions . Next a counter plan is developed under a different set of assumptions which are opposite to the initial assumptions [ Mason 1969 ] . A debate then takes place and the group as a whole adopts a plan . In DA , on the other hand , only one plan is developed under some explicit set of assumptions . This plan is then criticized by the 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 3 devil’s advocates ( a subgroup , different planners etc . ) to find all that are wrong with the plan . The plan is then revised in light of the criticisms and the devil’s advocates again criticize the plan . This process continues until an eventual plan is accepted by the group [ Schweiger et al . 1986 ] . Past studies on the effect of DA & DI have suggested that they bring positive impacts on the groups by reducing such negative effects as groupthink , avoidance of uncertainty , premature smoothing over conflict etc . [ Tung and Heminger 1993 , Schwenk 1990 ] . In recent years the techniques of DI and DA have been integrated with various GDSS environments to study the resulting impacts [ Tung and Heminger 1993 , Valacich and Schwenk 1995 ] . Both process and outcome measures were studied and the results were mixed . Tung and Heminger found no significant differences among the DA , DI and Consensus methods in terms of meeting quality , outcome & process satisfaction etc . However the authors found that DI groups made significant assumptions of higher validity than the Consensus or DA groups . Valacich and Schwenk found that DA groups developed and considered more alternatives and selected higher quality recommendations than the DI and expert based approaches . The authors also found that DA and expert based approaches needed more voting rounds to reach agreement than the DI approach . However , in terms of satisfaction ( process and solution ) there were no significant differences among DA , DI and expert based approaches . 1 . 2 Research Objectives Above studies on DA and DI in the context of GDSS reveal some inherent weaknesses . All of these studies deal with only networked GDSS [ Tung and Quaddus 1996 ] . While the studies deal with various process and outcome measures they don’t measure the level of conflict which are supposed to be generated due to the introduction of DA and DI . Chances are that computer aided regular group work can generate enough conflict by itself due to its very structured approach . Above studies have also dealt with only one task - hence the results are limited to the extent of the task . The research presented in this paper addresses the above weaknesses . It deals with Decision Conferencing as the computer supported group environment and deals with two tasks to explore the variation of results due to the task differences . To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of its kind which deals with the DA and DI methods in Decision Conferencing . In particular , the objectives of this research are as follows : ( i ) To investigate the level of conflict development due to the introduction of DA and DI methods in Decision Conferencing and to explore how the generated conflicts are managed and if they are productive for the group work . ( ii ) To investigate the interaction of tasks with DA and DI methods in the development and management of conflict . 2 . RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND HYPOTHESES This study is organized around three research questions and related hypotheses as follows : 1 . How does conflict differ in DA and DI methods compared to the Consensus ( C ) approach in Decision Conferencing ? This question focuses on the level of conflict in DA , DI and C approaches in Decision Conferencing . It is noted that in C approach the group works together as a whole and the conflict is generated naturally in the course of the group process , i . e . no artificial conflict is generated . We are interested in two broad categories of conflict as “issue - based” and “interpersonal” [ Miranda and Bostrom 1993 ] . Issue - based conflict focuses on issues related to the task and is desirable , while the interpersonal conflict is directed at group members and can be dysfunctional . As mentioned earlier , we are also interested in identifying the roles of different tasks in conflict generation and as such we study two different tasks in this research . Both DA and DI are , by definition , structured conflict approaches . Their application would expectedly generate greater levels of conflict than the C approach , which is the control for this study [ Priem and Price 1991 ] . Earlier studies on the comparison of DA and DI also reveal that different levels of issue - based and interpersonal conflicts are generated by the two approaches [ Priem & Price 1991 , Schweiger et al . 1986 ] . Since in DI two sets of plans and assumptions are proposed , the proponents of DI argue that it creates an environment where more issue based conflicts are generated compared to both DA and C . Participants in DI are also likely to develop more emotional stakes in their respective plans and this would lead to certain level of interpersonal conflict in DI . The method of DA dictates that the nature of the criticisms by the “devil’s advocates” as being destructive rather than constructive [ Mason 1969 ] . As such interpersonal conflict is expected to emerge more prominently in DA . Due to the lack of earlier research involving multiple tasks in GDSS environment , we only explore the contribution of tasks and make no explicit propositions . We thus suggest the following hypotheses : 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 4 H1a : For each task , groups using DI and DA experience higher issue based conflict than those using C . H1b : For each task , groups using DI experience higher issue based conflict than those using DA . H1c : For each task , groups using DI and DA experience higher interpersonal conflict than those using C . H1d : For each task , groups using DA experience higher interpersonal conflict than those using DI . 2 . How does strategies of conflict management differ in DA and DI methods compared to the C approach in Decision Conferencing ? This question focuses on the strategies of conflict management in DA , DI , and C approaches in Decision Conferencing . We are interested in investigating three strategies as “integrative” , “distributive” , and “avoidance” [ Miranda and Bostrom 1993 , Poole et al . 1991 ] . The integrative strategy attempts to work on the conflicts and identify and achieve outcomes that are satisfying to all group members and therefore is desirable . It is a “win - win” strategy . In distributive strategy the conflicts rise to such a point that some members of the group give in to the dominance of other members . Power play becomes a dominant factor and , therefore , distributive strategy is undesirable . In avoidance strategy conflict is not resolved to the full extent . This strategy , therefore , could lead to groupthink and reduction of satisfaction of the group members . While none of the strategies were found to be universally effective , integrative strategy is considered to be more suitable for strategic decision making [ Rahim 1986 ] . There is a lack of relevant literature on the conflict management strategies in the context of DA and DI . We therefore formulate the hypotheses purely on the basis of roles of DA and DI and the process of Decision Conferencing . As mentioned elsewhere [ Quaddus et al . 1992 ] , Decision Conferencing promotes open and extended discussions , integrates opposing view points and preferences and attempts to achieve a shared understanding and commitment to action . It is therefore argued that in the C approach , where group works more as a team than opposing parties , there will be more integrative conflict management strategies . The DI and DA approaches will definitely have lesser element of the avoidance strategy than the C approach . This is because they are essentially conflict eliciting approaches . The DI approach should see a higher utilization of integrative strategies than the DA approach . This is because the DA approach requires the “devil’s advocates” to criticize the plan which may impede mutual discussions and lead to lower utilization of integrative strategies . Since conflicts are generated deliberately in DA and DI and debates take place in an open forum , there is a likelihood that DA and DI groups will experience more distributive strategies than the C groups . We thus suggest the following hypotheses : H2a : For each task , C groups will use more integrative strategies to conflict management than the DA and DI groups . H2b : For each task , the DA and DI groups will use more distributive strategies than the C groups . H2c : For each task , DA and DI groups will use less avoidance strategies than the C groups . 3 . Does conflict and its management lead to productive group work and does it differ in DA , DI , and C approaches ? This question focuses on the resulting impact of conflict and its management on the outcome of the group work in the approaches of DA , DI and C . Past literature [ Mason 1969 , Schweiger et al . 1986 , Schwenk 1983 , 1990 ] suggests that DA and DI approaches improve decision making compared to the C approach . As mentioned previously , in the context of GDSS the results are mixed [ Tung & Heminger 1993 , Valacich & Schwenk 1995 ] . In line with Mason [ 1969 ] we propose that decision making in DI will be more productive than DA , since DI offers two sets of assumptions and plans and the group members have a better world view of the problem . We thus suggest the following hypotheses : H3a : For each task , groups using DI and DA will experience higher perceived productivity than those using C . H3b : For each task , groups using DI will experience higher perceived productivity than those using DA . 3 . RESEARCH MODEL AND METHOD The research model for this study is presented in Figure 1 . As noted in the model , we used only one technological support as Decision Conferencing , using HIVIEW as the decision support software [ Quaddus et al . 1992 ] . The conflict generation techniques of DA , DI , and C were also used as input to the model , which have been described previously . As mentioned before , we used two tasks . The resource allocation task has been developed and validated by Watson et al . [ 1988 ] . It requires groups to allocate funds to a list of competing projects based on the values of the group members . This task falls in the “choose” quadrant of McGrath’s [ 1984 ] task circumplex . It’s a relatively easy task to deal with as the alternatives ( competing projects ) are given . The planning task is of strategic planning type [ Whetten and Cameron 1984 ] and requires the development 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 5 of strategies to address several problems faced by a small college . This task falls in the “generate” quadrant of McGrath’s [ 1984 ] circumplex and requires generation of novel ideas . This task has been used previously by various authors [ Sambamurthy and Poole 1992 , Quaddus et al . 1997 ] . The interactions of technology ( specifically , structures imposed by the technology ) , conflict generation methods and task create conflict which needs to be managed properly . As discussed previously and noted in Figure 1 , the output of the research model is the amount of conflict , management of conflict and productiveness of conflict . 3 . 1 Research Design Ideal research design for this study would be a 3 x 2 factorial design , i . e . two factors with three and two levels respectively . The first factor is the “inquiry” methods with three levels as DA , DI , and C . The second factor is the “task” with two levels as resource allocation and planning tasks . However , research reported in this study is part of a comprehensive research on conflict in technology supported group work [ Tung and Quaddus 1996 ] . Thus to avoid duplication of effort , research design adopted in this study was a 2 x 2 factorial design . The “inquiry” factor was used with only two levels as DA and DI . Data on C method was collected from a similar study which also used Decision Conferencing as the technology environment .

It is noted that each group worked on two tasks , one using the DA approach and the other using the DI approach . The order of inquiry methods was counterbalanced , i . e . ten groups used DA method first , whereas the other ten groups used DA method second . This was done in order to minimize the order effects .

A total of 116 students ( 52 . 5 % female ) participated in this study . They formed 20 adhoc groups of size five or six . The subjects were drawn from a large class of over 1000 students and they were randomly assigned to treatment conditions . 3 . 3 Instruments Two instruments were used in this study . They were the pre - session survey and the post session questionnaire . The pre - session survey was conducted during the half - hour pre - session preparation . The purpose of this survey was primarily to gather demographic and personality data about the research subjects , as well as their level of acquaintance with one another etc . The post session questionnaire constituted the main source of data in this study . It had three sections measuring the amount of conflict , conflict management strategies , and productivity of conflict . All questions in the questionnaire had a 7 - point Likert scale which the subjects used to measure their perceptions . The instrument was developed and tested by Miranda & Bostrom [ 1993 ] . It has also been used recently by Quaddus et al [ 1997 ] . 3 . 4 Procedure The experiments were held within a Decision Conferencing environment . The process of Decision Conferencing ( as discussed in section 1 . 1 ) was strictly followed . A written script was used to make sure that all experiments are 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 6 performed as similarly as possible . Upon arrival at the experimental site , subjects were briefed on the session itself , the nature of inquiry approaches ( DA & DI ) , and background on the two tasks . There are a number of ways to operationalize the DA and DI methods [ Mason 1969 , Valacich & Schwenk 1995 ] . In this study we chose to use the sub - grouping approach which is very common in the literature . Each group , in this study , was randomly divided into two subgroups . For every DI experiments , the two subgroups were given two different and countering guidelines for their decisions . The two subgroups thus came up with two different sets of assumptions and proposals quite easily . To apply the Decision Conferencing process , each subgroup then independently came up with different sets of criteria , strategies and weightings for the strategies based on the criteria . At this point subgroups debated and reached agreement on a common proposal before proceeding to the next step of the Decision Conferencing process with the group as a whole . For DA experiments , the two subgroups were randomly assigned as “non - devil” and “devil” . The non - devil sub - group came up with a set of assumptions , criteria , and strategies for the task at hand . The devil sub - group then criticized the criteria and the strategies , and in view of these criticisms the non - devil subgroup revised the proposal . This process continued until an agreement was reached . The weightings and subsequent steps of the Decision Conferencing then continued with the group as a whole . The group sessions were facilitated by a facilitator and an analyst . HIVIEW [ Quaddus et al . 1992 ] was used as the primary software for decision modelling . For both DI and DA sessions , the analyst was responsible for the input of criteria , strategies and weightings into the HIVIEW software to come up with the group decision model . Exploration and sensitivity analyses of the model were then performed by the entire group to decide on the optimal strategy . 3 . 5 Pilot Experiment A pilot experiment was conducted in accordance with the above design . This was conducted for two reasons . Firstly , the feasibility of the design required some form of testing . Secondly , it was conducted to refine upon the session procedures . One full pilot session , consisting of one DI and one DA experiment , was conducted . Two elements of the research design were particularly tested for their feasibility : time allocated for each activity in a session , and the scripts of the facilitator . It was found that time was a great constraint for the experiment . However , it was also discovered that properly drafted script can help to ensure smooth running of the sessions through minimizing unnecessary delays . Minor modifications to the script were thus made to perform the experiments efficiently . 4 . RESULTS A series of two - way ANOVAs were run to test the hypotheses related to various research questions . Although hypotheses were preset , we were also interested to see if there is any impact of the treatment variables in the global sense . ANOVA test is therefore justified in this situation . 4 . 1 Hypotheses related to Issue - Based Conflict Table 2 presents the ANOVA results for issue - based conflict . It is observed that “Approach” is not significant , though table 3 indicates that total mean for DI ( 34 . 74 ) is greater than those of DA ( 33 . 98 ) and C ( 33 . 86 ) . However , an in - depth analysis was done for each task separately . It was found that for the resource allocation task , DA groups have higher issue - based conflicts than the DI and C groups ( p = 0 . 058 & 0 . 014 respectively ) , thus supporting hypothesis H1a partly . For the strategic planning task , DI groups have higher issue - based conflicts than the DA and C groups ( p = 0 . 0016 & 0 . 075 respectively ) , thus supporting hypotheses H1a and H1b partly . For the same task , however , DA groups have lower issue - based conflicts than the C groups ( p = 0 . 026 ) . We , therefore , conclude that hypotheses H1a and H1b are not fully supported and the results are mixed . This is an interesting result as the conflict generation techniques of DI and DA did not produce more conflicts than the C approach . One reason for this could be the Decision Conferencing environment itself . As indicated in Figure 1 , the structures introduced by the Decision Conferencing ( primarily the modelling and sensitivity analyses ) are conducive to producing more issue - based conflict .

Table 3 shows that total mean of “Resource Allocation” task ( 35 . 14 ) is greater than that of “Strategic Planning” task ( 33 . 33 ) and it is significant . By examining the interaction effects , Table 3 reveals that for both DA and C “Resource Allocation” task has higher mean than those of “Strategic Planning” task . It is , therefore , safe to claim that “Resource Allocation” task did produce higher issue - based conflict than the “Strategic Planning” task . It is rather surprising , as “Resource Allocation” task , in this study , was a relatively easy task , whereas the “Strategic Planning” task was more challenging . One reason could be that the “Resource Allocation” task was carried out first and the subjects were more enthusiastic and more discussions and debates took place during the first session than the second session . 4 . 2 Hypotheses related to Interpersonal Conflict As indicated in Table 4 , the “Approach” is not significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) for the interpersonal conflict , i . e . DI , DA , and C all produced more or less similar interpersonal conflict ( see Table 5 for the total means which are 11 . 63 , 11 . 52 , and 11 . 23 respectively ) . Further in - depth analyses for each task did not also reveal any significant results supporting the hypothesis . Therefore , Hypotheses H1c and H1d are not supported . It is however encouraging to observe that the levels of interpersonal conflicts are much smaller ( in the scale of 6 to 42 , see Table 5 ) than the corresponding levels of issue - based conflicts ( in the scale of 8 to 56 , see Table 3 ) , which are desirable .

Table 7 also shows that the mean scores are also fairly close . Hypotheses H2a is , therefore , not supported . As mentioned earlier , due to lack of relevant literature this hypothesis was formed on the basis of expected roles of DA , DI , and C . This study has shown that levels of integrative strategies usage are similar for DA , DI , and C .

However , the “Interaction” effect is significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) . Table 8 : ANOVA for Distributive Strategy Effect Computed F Significance Approach 1 . 092 0 . 337 Task 2 . 548 0 . 111 Approach x Task Interaction 3 . 906 0 . 021 Table 9 shows that , for resource allocation task DA and DI have higher means than that of C approach . Tests of means revealed that DA and DI groups used significantly higher distributive strategies than the C groups ( p = 0 . 002 & 0 . 078 respectively ) , thus supporting hypothesis H2b partly . On the other hand for strategic planning task , means of distributive strategies were not found to be significantly different for the DI , DA , and C groups . It is , therefore , concluded that hypothesis H2b is not fully supported and the results are mixed . By comparing Tables 7 and 9 it is observed that overall the groups used more integrative strategies than the distributive strategies , which is a desirable result .

DA , DI and C groups are significantly different in terms of using the avoidance strategy . Further tests of means revealed that , DI groups used significantly lower avoidance strategies than the C groups for both resource allocation ( p = 0 . 037 ) and planning ( p = 0 . 00 ) tasks . On the other hand DA groups Table 10 : ANOVA for Avoidance Strategy Effect Computed F Significance Approach 6 . 376 0 . 002 Task 0 . 285 0 . 594 Approach x Task Interaction 1 . 530 0 . 218 used lower avoidance strategies for the resource allocation task ( 15 . 35 versus 16 . 10 , see Table 11 ; p = . 176 ) and significantly lower for the planning task ( p = 0 . 00 ) . Considering all , we claim that hypothesis H2c is supported . Table 11 : Cell Means , Std Deviations , & N for Avoidance Strategy ResAllocation StratPlanning Total DI 14 . 76 ( 3 . 76 , 54 ) 14 . 94 ( 4 . 04 , 62 ) 14 . 85 ( 3 . 89 ) DA 15 . 35 ( 4 . 30 , 62 ) 14 . 63 ( 4 . 34 , 54 ) 15 . 02 ( 4 . 31 ) C 16 . 10 ( 3 . 75 , 40 ) 17 . 38 ( 2 . 88 , 40 ) 16 . 74 ( 3 . 38 ) Total 15 . 34 ( 3 . 99 ) 15 . 46 ( 4 . 03 ) 5 = no conflict ; 35 = highest conflict 4 . 6 Hypotheses related to Productivity o f Conflict As seen in Table 12 , the effect of “Approach” is not significant , i . e . the DI , DA and C groups perceived the productivity of conflicts to be similar . This contradicts some earlier studies in the manual groups environment where they found that DI and DA groups are more 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 9 productive than the C groups in terms of improving the decision making [ Mason 1969 , Schweiger et al . 1986 ] . Table 12 also shows that there are no significant “Task” and “Interaction” effects . However , a close look at the individual tasks show that , for both tasks , means of DI and DA groups are higher than the corresponding means of C groups ( Table 13 ) . Further significant tests , however , reveal that for resource allocation task means for DI and DA groups are not significantly greater than that of C groups ( for DI vs . C p = 0 . 11 ) . For the planning task , mean of DA is greater than the mean of C groups ( p = 0 . 012 ) , while others are not significant . It can , therefore , be concluded that while the ANOVA table shows no significant effects of the “Approach” , further analyses , however , show some mixed results .

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION This study is the first of its kind to investigate the impacts of conflict generation methods of DA , DI , and C for a specific group decision support system called Decision Conferencing . Researchers have been exploring the performance of group decision making over the last few decades . It is a belief that any group work must generate enough conflict to improve the decision making and past literature supports this belief . Our objectives in this research were to see what level of conflicts are generated in the Decision Conferencing environment , how these conflicts are managed and whether the conflicts are productive or not . The important findings of this research are as follows : 1 . No clear winner in generating conflicts : DI , DA and C methods are not significantly different in generating interpersonal conflicts . For the issue - based conflicts results were mixed and task type had a significant impact . For the resource allocation task , DA outperformed both DI and C , however for the strategic planning task DI outperformed DA and C . The level of issue - based conflicts had been always on the much higher side than the interpersonal conflicts . This indicates that the process of Decision Conferencing might have an important role in conflict generation . Due to its structured approach and modelling process Decision Conference generated more issue - based than interpersonal conflicts and the subjects did not perceive any significant contribution of the inquiry methods . 2 . DA and DI methods used less avoidance strategy than the C method : It was found that the DA and DI methods used significantly less avoidance strategy than the C method . This is an expected result . The methods of DA and DI force the group members to take positions and debate and resolve issues . Whereas in C method one or more group members might be inactive and keep the conflicts unresolved . It was also found that all three inquiry methods used similar levels of integrative strategies , which was much higher than the avoidance or distributive strategies . This a direct impact of Decision Conferencing . By its very nature it keeps the group decision focused and creates an environment where the members feel committed to the process . 3 . No clear winner in the perceived productivity of conflict : Productivity of conflict has been found to be on the high side ( around low 40s in the scale of 8 to 56 ) . However there was no clear winner , except DA being better than C in the strategic planning task . This again shows the impact of Decision Conferencing which makes the outcome satisfactory to all the group members . Above findings are not uncommon in the context of inquiry methods used in the manual or computer aided group work [ Tung & Heminger 1993 , Valacich and Schwenk 1995 , Schwenk 1990 ; among many others ] . Our study , however , indicated the impact of task in the final outcome . As mentioned earlier almost all the past studies have been conducted using only one task . Our results show that there are important interactions of tasks with the inquiry methods . It was observed that DA method interacted with 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 1060 - 3425 / 98 $ 10 . 00 ( C ) 1998 IEEE 10 the resource allocation task to produce the largest issue - based conflict and use the largest distributive strategy ( Tables 3 & 9 ) . On the other hand , DA method also interacted with the strategic planning task to produce the smallest issue - based conflict and distributive strategy ( Tables 3 & 9 ) . More research is needed using multiple tasks to establish the link , if any .
