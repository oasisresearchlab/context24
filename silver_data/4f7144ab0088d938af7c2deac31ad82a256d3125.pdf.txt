Pollard * †‡ § Departments of * Molecular , Cellular , and Developmental Biology , † Cell Biology , and ‡ Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry , Yale University , New Haven , CT 06520 Contributed by Thomas D . Pollard , August 12 , 2004 Formins are large multidomain proteins required for assembly of actin cables that contribute to the polarity and division of animal and fungal cells . Formin homology - 1 ( FH1 ) domains bind proﬁlin , and highly conserved FH2 domains nucleate actin ﬁlaments . We characterized the effects of two formins , budding yeast Bni1p and ﬁssion yeast Cdc12p , on actin assembly . We used evanescent wave ﬂuorescence microscopy to observe assembly of actin ﬁlaments ( i ) nucleated by soluble formin FH1FH2 domains and ( ii ) associated with formin FH1FH2 domains immobilized on microscope slides . Bni1p ( FH1FH2 ) p and Cdc12p ( FH1FH2 ) p nucleated new actin ﬁla - ments or captured the barbed ends of preformed actin ﬁlaments that grew by insertion of subunits between the immobilized formin and the barbed end of the ﬁlament . Both formins remained bound to growing actin ﬁlament barbed ends for > 1 , 000 sec . Elongation of a ﬁlament between an immobilized formin and a second anchor point buckled ﬁlament segments as short as 0 . 7 (cid:1) m , demonstrating that polymerization of single actin ﬁlaments pro - duces forces of > 1 piconewton , close to the theoretical maximum . After buckling , further growth produced long loops that did not supercoil , suggesting that formins do not stair step along the two subunits exposed on the growing barbed end . In agreement , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex branched ﬁlaments did not rotate as they grew from formins attached to the slide surface . Formins are not mech - anistically identical because barbed end elongation from Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p , but not Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , requires proﬁlin . How - ever , proﬁlinincreasedtherateofBni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p - mediatedbarbed end elongation from 75 % to 100 % of full - speed . M any cellular structures composed of actin filaments de - pend on formins , so the discovery that the FH2 domain of budding yeast Bni1p stimulates spontaneous polymerization of pure actin was a major advance ( 1 , 2 ) . Biochemical experiments in those pioneering papers and subsequent work ( 3 – 5 ) suggest that Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p nucleates filaments and then allows both the fast growing barbed end and slowly growing pointed end of the filaments to elongate . Several lines of evidence suggest that formins bind actin filament barbed ends and remain in place as filaments grow . Although Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p does not raise the critical concen - tration like a barbed end capping protein , it was observed to bind near barbed ends by immunoelectron microscopy ( 1 ) and inhibits association of capping protein with barbed ends ( 4 , 5 ) . The FH1FH2 domains of fission yeast formin Cdc12p tightly cap actin filament barbed ends and nucleate short filaments that grow slowly from their pointed ends ( 6 ) . The actin – monomer binding protein profilin allows filaments nucleated by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p to grow at their barbed ends ( 6 ) . Because Cdc12p inhibits end to end annealing of actin filaments even in the presence of profilin ( 6 ) , profilin might not simply dissociate Cdc12p from barbed ends . Indeed , Higashida et al . ( 7 ) recently showed that aggregates of the mammalian formin mDia1 per - sistently associate with elongating barbed ends . Here , we used real - time evanescent wave fluorescence microscopy to observe the assembly of individual filaments attached to yeast formins . We measured the force produced by actin polymerization , addressed some of the unresolved kinetic and thermodynamic problems raised by the presence of a formin on a growing barbed end , and compared the mechanisms of budding yeast Bni1p and fission yeast Cdc12p . Materials and Methods Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification . Bacterial expression plasmids for Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p were con - structed by using standard methods ( 8 ) . Proteins were purified as described ( 6 ) with minor modifications ( Fig . 4 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . For details , refer to Supporting Text , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) Microscopy . We col - lected images of fluorescent actin filaments excited by total internal reflection at 15 - sec intervals with a Hamamatsu C4742 – 95 CCD camera ( Orca - ER ) on an Olympus IX - 70 mi - croscope and processed them with IMAGEJ software ( http : (cid:1)(cid:1) rsb . info . nih . gov (cid:1) ij ) as described in detail ( 6 , 9 ) . Glass flow cells of 5 (cid:1) 25 (cid:1) 0 . 3 mm ( width (cid:1) length (cid:1) height ) ( 9 ) were incubated with either 100 nM Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , 100 nM GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , 250 nM GST - Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p , or 10 nM N - ethylmaleimide ( NEM ) - myosin and Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p or GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p for 2 – 5 min , washed extensively with 1 % BSA , and equilibrated with TIRF buffer { 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 (cid:1) 50 mM KCl (cid:1) 1 mM MgCl 2 (cid:1) 1 mM EGTA (cid:1) 50 mM DTT (cid:1) 0 . 2 mM ATP (cid:1) 50 (cid:1) M CaCl 2 (cid:1) 15 mM glucose (cid:1) 20 (cid:1) g / ml catalase (cid:1) 100 (cid:1) g / ml glucose oxidase , 0 . 5 % [ 4 , 000 cP ( centipoise ; 1 P (cid:2) 0 . 1 Pa (cid:1) sec ) ] methylcellulose } . Mixtures of unlabeled Mg - ATP actin and either Mg - ATP Oregon green ( OG ) actin or Mg - ATP Alexa green ( AG ) actin monomers were mixed with 2 (cid:1) TIRF buffer supplemented with water and formin , profilin , Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , GST - WA , capping protein , or phalloidin to give the final con - centrations indicated in the figure legends . These samples were transferred to a flow cell , and imaging began as soon as filaments appeared ( 2 – 5 min , depending on flow and polymerization rates ) . In some experiments , a second sample with twice the concentration of labeled actin replaced the initial sample during continuous imaging . Maximum intensity projections revealed movement - constricted NEM - myosin II and formin attachment points of individual filaments ( 6 ) . Calculation of Force . The force of actin assembly required to buckle actin filaments was calculated with a derivation of the beam equation ( 10 ) F c ( Euler force ) (cid:2) (cid:2) 2 ( EI (cid:1) L 2 ) , where EI is the flexural rigidity of an actin filament , and L is the distance between attachment points at the buckling moment .

Results Comparison of Budding Yeast Bni1p and Fission Yeast Cdc12p . We used time - lapse TIRF microscopy ( 6 , 9 ) to observe the effects of fission yeast Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and budding yeast Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p on growing actin filaments attached to the surface of glass slides by NEM - myosin II ( Fig . 1 and diagram 1 in Fig . 2 a ) . Direct observation of individual actin filaments eliminated the need to make assumptions about the effects of formins on filament ends , as required with bulk assembly assays . We obtained similar results by using 1 (cid:1) M unlabeled actin with a trace of fluorescent actin labeled on either cys - 374 ( OG - actin ) or on lysines ( AG - actin ) . Fluorescent subunits allow visualiza - tion of the filaments , but unlabeled actin accounts for most of the growth ( 9 ) . NEM - myosin bound to the microscope slide an - chored filaments at one or a few points along their length , leaving both ends free to elongate . First we compared the effects of formin on the elongation of preexisting actin filaments ( Fig . 1 a – f and Fig . 5 a – c , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , and Table 1 ) . Movies 1 – 24 , corresponding to all time lapse micro - graphs , are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( residues 1227 – 1766 ) did not block barbed end growth , and nucleated many filaments that also grew at their barbed ends ( Fig . 1 d – f ) . Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p had no effect on pointed end growth . In contrast , Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( residues 882 – 1390 ) completely blocked growth at the barbed ends of most ( 95 % ) filaments without affecting growth at pointed ends ( Fig . 1 a – c ) , as we described previously for a Cdc ( FH1FH2 ) p con - struct consisting of residues 882 – 1375 ( 6 ) . Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p also nucleated numerous filaments that grew only at their pointed ends . Second , we compared the effects of formins on spontaneous assembly of new filaments ( Figs . 1 g – l and 5 d – o and Table 1 ) . Fig . 1 .

With Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p and profilin , barbed ends grew at the full rate , but pointed ends did not grow ( Fig . 1 j – l ) . Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p nucleated filaments that grew at their pointed ends only ( Fig . 5 j – l ) . Rare barbed ends ( (cid:5) 1 % ) in these samples grew normally , indicating that the monomer pool was not depleted . Profilin inhibited pointed end growth , but allowed filaments nucleated by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p to grow at their barbed ends at (cid:6) 75 % the normal rate ( Fig . 5 m – o ) . Persistent Attachment of Yeast Formins to Growing Barbed Ends . Next , we used TIRF microscopy to observe actin filaments growing on the surface of glass slides coated with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p or Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p . Higashida et al . ( 7 ) used a similar strategy to observe polymerization of rhodamine phalloidin - labeled filaments relative to immobilized clusters of antibodies and the mammalian formin mDia1 . Incubation of actin monomers on glass slides coated with formin FH1FH2 domains under polymerizing conditions ( dia - gram 2 in Fig . 2 a ) produced two types of actin filaments : filaments with free ends , and filaments growing with one end Fig . 2 .

Actin alone was required for growth from immobilized Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 2 c – m ) , whereas growth from immobilized Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p required actin and profilin ( Fig . 2 n – s ) . Filaments with one fixed end grew at rates near those of filaments with free barbed ends ( Fig . 2 c and e ; filament 2 ) in the same samples . Increasing the fraction of fluorescent actin by replacing the contents of the chamber during an experiment showed that new subunits inserted at the attached barbed end ( Fig . 2 f , g , k , l , q , and r ) . Some filaments rotated about their attachment points through angles up to 90° in static preparations and up to 180° when buffer flowed through the chamber . Growing filaments rarely dissociated from either formin : 8 . 0 (cid:1) 10 (cid:3) 4 sec (cid:3) 1 for Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p and (cid:5) 1 . 0 (cid:1) 10 (cid:3) 5 sec (cid:3) 1 for Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p . GST - tagged Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 2 b ) and GST - Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p were more active than the untagged constructs , but GST was not required for insertional assembly ( Figs . 2 i – m and 3 b – f ) . Although the number of formins immobilized on glass greatly exceeded the number of captured barbed ends , the active formins were fully functional . We measured bound formins by SDS (cid:1) PAGE and immunoblotting for GST . Approximately 20 % of 100 nM GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p remained bound to the sur - faces of flow chambers and was eluted with SDS . The bound formin corresponded to 40 formin dimers per (cid:1) m 2 of glass surface . Over 30 min , an average of 100 filaments per field grew from such a surface , corresponding to one filament per 6 , 500 attached Bni1p molecules ( 0 . 015 % ) . This calculation underes - timates the number of active immobilized formins , because the surface of the slide continued to nucleate ( (cid:6) 25 % ) and capture ( (cid:6) 75 % ) filaments at the same rate of two filaments per min throughout the 30 - min observation .

The active immobilized formins were indistinguishable from soluble formins : both supported persis - tent barbed end elongation at rates in the range of 50 – 100 % ( Fig . 2 d , h , m , and s ) of the rate of free barbed ends , and profilin allowed immobilized Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p to nucleate and support barbed end growth of actin filaments ( Fig . 2 q and r ) . The following observations are consistent with a single formin dimer anchoring each growing filament to the slide . Both tagged and untagged formins supported barbed end growth of single filaments from points on the slide . We never observed two filaments growing from the same point on the slide among the (cid:6) 1 , 000 that we observed . Gel filtration of Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p removed any aggregates , but did not change its properties when immobilized on a slide ( Figs . 2 i and j and 3 b – f ) . The Stokes’ radius of this homogeneous Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p was consistent with an asymmetric dimer . The fraction of filaments originating from or captured by an immobilized formin depended on the con - centration of formin used to coat the slide , with GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p capturing (cid:6) 3 - fold more filaments than Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p at all concentrations tested ( Fig . 2 b ) . Force Produced by Polymerization of Individual Actin Filaments . To measure the force produced by polymerization of individual actin filaments , we polymerized actin on slides preincubated with both a formin and NEM - myosin II to provide a second attach - ment point along the length of the filament ( diagram 3 in Fig . 2 a ) . When tethered by NEM - myosin , growth of a filament from immobilized Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 3 b – f ) or GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 3 a and h – m ) caused the filament to buckle between the formin and the NEM - myosin . As buckled filaments grew , they looped out randomly to the right or left between the two attachment points ( Fig . 3 a – f and h – m ) . As these loops grew , the maximum rotation around the point of barbed end attachment was 180° . Some doubly tethered fila - ments dissociated from the formin ( Fig . 3 c ) or NEM - myosin ( Fig . 3 d ) or broke between attachment points ( Fig . 3 e ) . The force required to buckle a rod is proportional to its stiffness and inversely proportional to its length squared ( 10 ) . Thus , the length of the shortest filament that buckled revealed the maximum observed force produced by actin polymerization . Polymerization of 0 . 25 (cid:1) M Mg - ATP actin with 0 . 1 (cid:1) M OG - actin buckled filaments between GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p and NEM - myosin attachment points separated by as little as 0 . 8 – 1 . 2 (cid:1) m ( Fig . 3 h – j ) , corresponding to forces of 0 . 25 – 0 . 56 pN . Polymer - ization of 0 . 5 (cid:1) M Mg - ATP actin with 0 . 2 (cid:1) M OG - actin and 20 (cid:1) M phalloidin buckled filaments between attachments sepa - rated by as little as 0 . 75 (cid:1) m ( Fig . 3 k – m ) . Phalloidin increases the stiffness of actin filaments 2 - fold , so polymerization produced a force of at least 1 . 3 pN , close to the theoretical maximum ( (cid:6) 2 pN ) under the experimental conditions . The flexibility of actin filaments and the resolution of the microscope limited the detection of buckling filaments shorter than 0 . 7 (cid:1) m and mea - surement of forces (cid:8) 1 . 3 pN . We expect that force transiently slows the rate of assembly as the filament buckles , but the temporal and spatial resolution ( (cid:6) 100 subunits ) were too small to detect this change . Mechanistic Details of Formin - Mediated Insertional Assembly at Actin Filament Barbed Ends . Buckling experiments provided further evidence that a single formin dimer is associated with an elongating barbed end . Gaussian line fits of buckled filaments showed that growing barbed ends remained fixed to a space representing a single pixel ( Fig . 3 j and m ) . Thus , barbed end attachment points of buckled filaments deviated (cid:5) 0 . 2 (cid:1) m for times as long as 500 sec . Buckled filaments growing in association with a formin or GST - formin remained attached to a single point during the addition of (cid:8) 7 , 000 new subunits ( Fig . 3 a and b ) . Upon dissociation from an immobilized formin , the elastic restoring force in a bent filament caused it to ‘‘snap out’’ from the attachment point ( Fig . 3 a and c ) , almost never rebinding to another fixed point on the slide . The low probability of recapture during elastic recoil means that a filament growing under tension from a single point over hundreds of seconds must associate continuously with a single active formin dimer rather than jumping locally between formins in an aggregate . Additionally , we note that the barbed end elongation rate in the presence of formins is 30 - fold higher than the ATP - hydrolysis rate , measured without formin ( 14 ) , suggesting that ATP hydrolysis does not regulate formin - mediated insertional assembly . Elongating filaments did not rotate relative to the immobilized formin . First , branches formed by Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex did not rotate as they grew from an immobilized GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 3 g ) . Capping protein included in these experiments limited the growth of branches formed by Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex , but not elon - gation of barbed ends anchored to the slide by formins . This finding confirms that formins protect barbed ends from capping protein ( 4 , 5 , 15 ) . Second , although loops between a formin and a myosin grew to (cid:6) 20 (cid:1) m ( 284 turns of the actin helix ) ( Fig . 3 a and b ) , none of (cid:8) 50 of these long loops attached to Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) or GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p supercoiled or twisted like tethered filaments translocated by myosin ( 16 ) . This finding provides strong evidence that filaments growing from immobi - lized formins do not rotate . Discussion By direct comparison , we show that budding yeast Bni1p and fission yeast Cdc12p are not mechanistically identical . Cdc12p , but not Bni1p , requires profilin to allow barbed end assembly . However , we found that profilin does increase the barbed end elongation rate of individual Bni1p nucleated filaments , from 75 % to 100 % of full - speed , which explains why bulk assembly rates in the presence of Bni1p are increased by profilin ( 2 , 4 ) even though profilin reduces Bni1p - dependent actin nucleation ( 3 ) . Additionally , we provide evidence that the barbed end of an individual growing filament remains bound to a single formin molecule for (cid:8) 1 , 000 sec , 50 times longer than predicted from indirect experiments ( 5 ) . Independently , Higashida et al . ( 7 ) observed barbed end growth of numerous actin filaments from ‘‘large aggregates’’ of mDia1 and antibodies . They also made spectacular movies of ‘‘single or a few EGFP molecules coupled to multimeric mDia1’’ surfing on actin filaments in cells . Their use of fluorescent formins is ideal for observing surfing of formins in cells . The single , immobilized formins used here have advantages for biophysical analysis , because the formin is be - tween the surface and the growing barbed end of the filament . Our observations of formin - mediated barbed end insertional polymerization are completely consistent with experiments on several formins ( 1 – 6 , 15 , 17 ) . However , few mechanistic details were known . A popular idea is that one FH2 domain of a formin dimer maintains contact with the barbed end of one strand of the actin helix , whereas the other FH2 domain interacts with the end of the other long pitch helix ( 4 , 5 , 18 ) . Flexible linkers between the two formin FH2 domains ( 18 ) might accommodate the 2 . 7 - nm offset of the two actin subunits . This mechanism postu - lates that growth of a barbed end involves dissociation of the trailing formin FH2 domain from its strand , addition of an actin subunit to that strand , and reassociation of the formin FH2 domain with the new terminus of the filament . Because barbed ends grow at (cid:8) 10 subunits per second in vitro and (cid:8) 100 subunits per second in vivo ( 19 ) , FH2 domains would have to dissociate rapidly from the penultimate actin subunit , but very slowly ( half time of (cid:8) 1 , 000 sec according to our measurements ) from the terminal subunit . Kovar and Pollard PNAS (cid:2) October 12 , 2004 (cid:2) vol . 101 (cid:2) no . 41 (cid:2) 14729 B I O P H Y S I C S S EE C O MM E N T A R Y Two experiments show that filaments elongating while an - chored by a formin do not twist as expected if the formin were immobilized and tracked along the growing actin helix : loops between a myosin anchor and an immobilized formin do not supercoil , and branches formed by Arp2 (cid:1) 3 complex do not rotate . If a filament is prevented from rotating by a myosin anchor , growth at its barbed end will rotate the orientation of subunits 360° for every 26 subunits added . Thus , the formin must reorient rapidly on the end of the growing filament or the tether between the formin and the glass must include a rotatable bond . We have never observed rotation of a filament about its attach - ment point by (cid:8) 180° , even under fluid flow . Thus , alternatives to simple stair - stepping mechanisms should be considered , such as rotation of a growing actin helix relative to the FH2 ho - modimer like a shaft in a bearing . It has also been proposed that formins might bind to the side at the barbed end of the actin filament ( 15 ) . Rigorous experimentation will be required to differentiate between these and other possible mechanisms . It has long been appreciated that actin polymerization pro - duces force for cell motility ( 20 , 21 ) , but analysis of this force has been restricted to theoretical studies and investigations of sam - ples of numerous filaments . Biomimetic systems allow measure - ments of the force produced by populations of actin filaments pushing on a bacterium , bead , or vesicle ( 22 – 25 ) . However , these systems are subject to both propulsive forces and opposing friction , and do not reveal the force produced by individual actin filaments . Polymerization of an individual actin filament tethered be - tween a formin and a myosin molecule in the presence of phalloidin produced a force of at least 1 . 3 pN , close to the theoretical maximum ( (cid:6) 2 pN ) under the experimental condi - tions . Thus , the polymerization motor is very efficient . Micro - tubules are much stiffer , and their elongation produces buckling forces up to 10 pN ( 13 , 26 ) . Because only short filaments are sufficiently stiff to transmit the polymerization force without buckling , capping protein is useful to limit the length of the force - producing filaments at the leading edge of motile cells . The capacity of actin polymerization to produce force in association with a formin supports the idea that formins mediate some protrusive forces in cells ( 7 , 27 ) . In the presence of profilin , looped filaments attached along their length by NEM - myosin and growing from immobilized GST - Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) have been observed to rotate up to 360° .
