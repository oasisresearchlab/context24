Identiﬁcation of a coﬁlin homolog in the yeast S . cere - visiae has opened new avenues for studying the function of this small actin - binding protein ( Iida et al . , 1993 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) . Because coﬁlin is an essential gene , it is possible to use yeast molecular genetics to identify coﬁlin residues that are important for coﬁlin – actin interactions . Systematic mutagenesis approaches combined with yeast genetics have been successfully applied to identify func - tional domains in other essential cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and β - tubulin ( Wertman et al . , 1992 ; Reijo et al . , 1994 ) . Here , we have combined systematic mutational analysis of the yeast COF1 gene and biochemical charac - terization of mutant coﬁlins . This approach allowed us to identify residues that are required for coﬁlin function in vivo and to analyze the biochemical defects of these Fig . 1 . Alignment of amino acid sequences of yeast ( S . cerevisiae ) , coﬁlin alleles . The mapping of these residues onto the human and fruitﬂy ( D . melanogaster ) coﬁlins ( Ogawa et al . , 1990 ; three - dimensional structure of yeast coﬁlin implicates Moon et al . , 1993a ; Gunsalus et al . , 1995 ) . The charged residues ( Lys , distinct molecular surfaces of coﬁlin in F - actin - and Arg , His , Glu and Asp ) are highlighted . The residues that were mutated are underlined and the corresponding allele numbers are G - actin - related functions . indicated above the sequence . Results of the 17 charged - to - alanine substitutions , are shown in Figure 1 . In addition to the charged - to - alanine mutations , Site - directed mutagenesis strategy The overall goal of our analyses was to identify by we replaced Ser4 with alanine ( cof1 - 4 ) and glutamate ( cof1 - 3 ) . This serine corresponds to a residue that is mutagenesis regions in yeast coﬁlin that are important for function in vivo , and to elucidate the biochemical defects phosphorylated in more complex eukaryotes ( Agnew et al . , 1995 ) . The serine - to - alanine mutation was intended to of the resulting mutants . We wished to discover mutations that impaired protein – protein interactions rather than pro - encode constitutively unphosphorylated coﬁlin , whereas the glutamate substitution was intended to mimic the tein stability . Since our mutagenesis was initiated prior to determination of the molecular structure of coﬁlin , we phosphorylated state . Finally , to test the importance of the ﬁrst ﬁve residues , which are disordered in the recently used a ‘clustered - charged - to - alanine’ strategy ( Bass et al . , 1991 ; Wertman et al . , 1992 ) to bias mutations to the determined crystal structure of yeast coﬁlin ( Fedorov et al . , 1997 ) , we also created a yeast coﬁlin allele ( cof1 - surface of the protein . Whenever two or more charged residues were present in a window of ﬁve residues , the 28 ) missing residues two to ﬁve . Oligonucleotide - directed mutagenesis was carried out charged residues were changed to alanines . Each mutant allele contained one to three amino acid substitutions as described in the Materials and Methods . For all mutations , the oligonucleotide sequence was designed to ( Table I ) . The alignment of S . cerevisiae , D . melanogaster and human coﬁlins , together with the amino acid changes make the mutation veriﬁable by restriction digest ( see 5521 P . Lappalainen et al . integrated , because recombination was forced to occur outside the coﬁlin open - reading - frame ( strategy adapted from Wertman et al . , 1992 ) . The presence of the desired mutations , and integration at the COF1 chromosomal locus , were veriﬁed by polymerase chain reaction ampli - ﬁcation of the genomic DNA and subsequent restriction endonuclease digestions as described in Materials and methods . In vivo phenotypes of cof1 mutants None of the mutations created in this work resulted in a dominant - lethal phenotype . Therefore , the mutant pheno - types were analyzed in haploid segregants . For each coﬁlin mutant , cells from two Leu (cid:4) / His – transformants were sporulated and at least six tetrads were dissected and germinated on rich medium at 20°C . Five charged - to - alanine alleles as well as the Ser4Glu mutant and the N - terminal deletion showed 2 : 2 segregation of viability : nonviability and all viable segregants were Leu – . These mutations are therefore concluded to result in recessive lethality ( Table I ) . Three mutants ( cof1 - 5 , cof 1 - 8 and cof1 - 22 ) showed temperature sensitivity for viability . cof1 - 5 and cof - 8 formed colonies of normal size between 14°C and Fig . 2 .

Oligonucleotides A and B [ shown wild - type COF1 allele over all temperatures examined in ( B ) ] were used for ampliﬁcation of the coﬁlin gene for the ( 14 – 37°C ) . subsequent analytical restriction enzyme digestion to conﬁrm the For the non - lethal cof1 alleles , actin organization was presence of the correct mutation in the genome . Oligonucleotides C examined by ﬂuorescence microscopy using rhodamine – and D were used for conﬁrming that the cof1 alleles were integrated into the correct position of the genome . Note that oligonucleotide D is phalloidin . We found that in the conditional - lethal alleles located outside the integrated region . ( cof1 - 5 , cof1 - 8 and cof1 - 22 ) actin organization was severely altered at the non - permissive temperature ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . In contrast , the alleles Table I ) . Most of the mutations introduce a new restriction site . However , cof1 - 3 , cof1 - 4 and cof1 - 17 destroy Bgl II that showed wild - type growth properties showed actin organization indistinguishable from that of the wild type sites . All mutations were veriﬁed at the plasmid stage by restriction digestions and subsequent DNA sequencing ( see Table I ) . The one exception was cof1 - 4 which showed slightly aberrant actin organization ( data not shown ) ( data not shown ) . despite having wild - type growth properties . Chromosomal integration of mutant coﬁlin genes in yeast diploids Biochemical properties of the mutant proteins In order to determine the biochemical defects that are All cof1 alleles were expressed in single copy at the COF1 chromosomal locus . The plasmid in which the mutagenesis responsible for the lethal and temperature - sensitive pheno - types observed in yeast , we expressed all such cof1 was performed contains the entire COF1 - coding sequence linked to the LEU2 gene , which was inserted 91 bp mutants in Escherichia coli and puriﬁed the recombinant proteins . In addition to these mutants , as a control , we downstream of the COF1 translational terminator . In this plasmid , COF1 and LEU2 are transcribed in the same expressed in E . coli Cof1 - 12 ( E55A , K56A ) , an allele for which no phenotype was detected in yeast . With one direction . LEU2 provided a selectable marker for the integration of the cof1 alleles ( Figure 2 ) . Strains expressing exception ( see below ) mutant proteins were expressed as glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion proteins in the wild - type COF1 linked to LEU2 at the COF1 chromosomal locus grow normally at all temperatures tested ( 14 – 37°C ) pGEX . 2T vector ( see Materials and methods ) . The fusion proteins were puriﬁed on glutathione – agarose , coﬁlin was ( Table I ) and have normal actin and coﬁlin organization ( data not shown ) . cleaved from GST by thrombin digestion , and the two resulting proteins were separated from each other by gel Plasmids carrying the cof1 mutant alleles were linearized as described in the Materials and methods . The linearized ﬁltration . The thrombin cleavage site introduces two additional residues ( glycine followed by serine ) at the cof1 - LEU2 fragments were transformed into a diploid strain carrying a disruption of COF1 ( cof1 - Δ 1 : : HIS3 ) .

In the Met1 – Gly5 deletion this would result in a replacement of Val6 and Ala7 by allele was replaced with the cof1 : : LEU2 from the plasmid . This also insured that the entire cof1 mutant allele was glycine and serine , respectively . Therefore , this mutant 5522 Mutational analysis of yeast coﬁlin changes which are not detected by monitoring tryptophan ﬂuorescence during urea denaturation . The interaction of yeast mutant coﬁlins with yeast actin ﬁlaments was ﬁrst studied by use of a co - sedimentation assay . Recombinant yeast coﬁlins and pre - polymerized yeast actin were mixed to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 μ M each . After incubation for 60 min at room temperature , the actin ﬁlaments were sedimented by centrifugation , and the amount of actin and coﬁlin in the pellets and super - natants was quantiﬁed by densitometry of Coomassie - stained SDS gels ( see Materials and methods ) . A representative gel from a co - sedimentation assay is shown in Figure 4A , and quantiﬁed data for all mutants are presented in Figure 4B . While Cof1 - 12 ( E55A , K56A ) ( control ) , Cof1 - 5 ( D10A , E11A ) and Cof1 - 9 ( D34A , K36A , E38A ) did not show a detectable decrease in F - actin binding , all other mutants showed a variable range of defects in actin ﬁlament binding ( Figure 4B ) . Mutants that showed defects in F - actin binding in this assay ( Figure 4B ) were analyzed further by co - sedimentation using a range of F - actin concentrations ( Figure 4C ) . Cof1 ( wild type ) shows saturation of binding at 4 μ M actin . Cof1 - 22 Fig . 3 . The stability of the recombinant proteins measured by and Cof1 - 20 bound to actin ﬁlaments more weakly at ﬂuorescence - monitored urea denaturation as described in Materials and all actin concentrations , but the binding increased in methods . The arbitary ﬂuorescence units are shown on the y - axis and the urea concentration on the x - axis . Note that Cof1 - 14 unfolds at a a concentration - dependent manner , suggesting that the signiﬁcantly lower urea concentration than wild - type coﬁlin . binding is saturable . In contrast , Cof1 - 16 , Cof1 - 17 and Cof1 - 28 show no signiﬁcant increase in binding within the F - actin concentration range tested ( 0 – 6 μ M ) , indicating ( Cof1 - 28 ) was instead expressed in E . coli as a non - fusion protein in the pBAT4 vector ( see Materials and methods ) . that these mutants bind to F - actin with very low afﬁnities . The ability of the mutant coﬁlins to interact with actin - This results in a recombinant protein with an identical N - terminal sequence to the corresponding yeast coﬁlin ATP monomers was assessed by native gel electrophoresis of coﬁlin – actin complexes and by inhibition of nucleotide allele ( cof1 - 28 ) . Recombinant wild - type and mutant coﬁlins , except for exchange by the actin monomer . Formation of the coﬁlin – G - actin complex has been shown to inhibit nucleotide Cof1 - 14 ( D68A , E70A , E72A ) , showed similar levels of expression in E . coli . The Cof1 - 14 allele was expressed at exchange by the actin monomer ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ) . The results from these two assays were entirely consistent approximately one - ﬁfth of the wild - type level , which may be a result of protein degradation . The elution proﬁles in that both implicated the same alleles as being defective in monomer binding . However , as the detection of coﬁlin – obtained using a Superdex - 75 gel - ﬁltration column suggest that wild - type coﬁlin and most coﬁlin mutants behave as actin monomer complexes from native gel electrophoresis is complicated by the mobility shifts caused by charged - monomers at neutral pH . However , (cid:3) 95 % of Cof1 - 8 ( K23A , K24A , K26A ) elutes from this column in the void to - alanine mutations , only the data from the nucleotide exchange assay are shown ( Figure 5 ) . Only three mutations volume , suggesting the formation of aggregates . After puriﬁcation by gel ﬁltration , wild - type coﬁlin , as well as ( Cof1 - 17 , Cof1 - 20 and Cof1 - 28 ) showed signiﬁcant defects in actin - ATP monomer binding in these two assays . all of the mutants , were (cid:3) 99 % pure , based on inspection of Coomassie - stained SDS gels ( data not shown ) . The Cof1 - 16 and Cof1 - 22 mutants that have severe defects in F - actin binding showed only very small defects in To determine the effects of speciﬁc mutations on the overall stability of the coﬁlin molecules , ﬂuorescence - G - actin binding , suggesting that the F - actin binding surface of coﬁlin is more extended than the G - actin binding monitored urea denaturation was performed on each recombinant protein ( Figure 3 ) . The behavior of the wild - surface . We next determined whether the coﬁlin mutations are type and mutant coﬁlins is consistent with a simple two - state unfolding transition . The wild type and most of the defective in F - actin depolymerization . Puriﬁed yeast actin was polymerized to a ﬁnal concentration of 5 μ M and mutants , including the N - terminal deletion , show a mid - point for the transition at ~ 5 . 3 M urea , indicating that was then diluted with buffer containing different coﬁlins to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 5 μ M coﬁlin and 0 . 5 μ M these mutations do not signiﬁcantly perturb the stability of coﬁlin . The mutant Cof1 - 20 ( D123A , E126A ) is slightly yeast F - actin . The depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments was followed immediately after dilution by the decrease in less stable ( 4 . 7 M ) , while Cof1 - 14 ( D68A , E70A , E72A ) is signiﬁcantly less stable than the wild type ( 3 . 6 M ) . light - scattering at 400 nm . As shown in Figure 6 , dilution of 5 μ M actin ﬁlaments to 0 . 5 μ M results in slow These data indicate that residues Asp68 , Glu70 and / or Glu72 contribute to the stability of coﬁlin . However , it is depolymerization of the ﬁlaments . This depolymerization occurs when the monomeric actin concentration falls important to note that this urea denaturation assay measures only the folded to unfolded transition of the entire coﬁlin below the critical concentration for F - actin assembly , which for ATP - actin is ~ 0 . 1 μ M ( Pollard , 1986 ) . Wild - molecule . Therefore , it is possible that some of our charged - to - alanine mutations result in local conformational type coﬁlin and Cof1 - 12 ( E55A , K56A ) ( control ) promote 5523 P . Lappalainen et al . a large increase in the actin ﬁlament depolymerization wild - type coﬁlin expressed as a GST fusion protein in the pGEX2T vector ( which results in the replacement of Met1 rates ( Figure 6 ) . All other mutants show variable defects in F - actin depolymerization . However , mutants Cof1 - 5 by glycine ) , and non - fusion wild - type coﬁlin expressed in pBAT4 ( which maintains Met1 ) , are indistinguishable in ( D10A , E11A ) and Cof1 - 9 ( D34A , K36A , E38A ) , both of which bind actin monomers and actin ﬁlaments with a all the biochemical assays described above ( data not shown ) . In addition , the mutant Cof1 - 12 ( E55A , K56A ) , similar afﬁnity to the wild - type coﬁlin , show only minor decreases in stimulation of actin ﬁlament depolymerization which showed no phenotype in yeast , did not show detectable differences compared with wild - type coﬁlin in compared with the wild - type coﬁlin ( Table II ) , despite showing dramatic defects ( temperature sensitivity or leth - any of our biochemical assays ( Table II ) . ality , respectively ) in vivo . Therefore , it is possible that the phenotypes of these two mutants result from a currently Mapping the coﬁlin alleles on the three - dimensional structure of yeast coﬁlin unidentiﬁed activity of coﬁlin . It should also be noted that The three - dimensional structure of yeast coﬁlin has been determined recently by X - ray crystallography ( Fedorov et al . , 1997 ) , allowing us to map the mutants generated in this study onto the surface of the coﬁlin molecule . The charged residues that can be mutated to alanines without a discernible in vivo phenotype are mostly clustered on either side of the ‘disc - shaped’ coﬁlin molecule ( Figure 7 , green ) , while the mutants that result in lethal or temperature - sensitive phenotypes cluster along the circum - ference of the molecule ( Figure 7 , red , orange and blue ) . The residues that are altered in mutants with reduced coﬁlin stability ( Lys23 , Lys24 , Lys26 , Asp68 , Glu70 and Glu72 ) are located proximal to each other ( Figure 6 , blue ) . Side chains of Lys23 and Asp68 form a salt bridge , while the side chain of Lys26 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asp68 . This offers a plausible explanation for the folding / stability problems in the Cof1 - 8 and Cof1 - 14 mutants . Residues Asp10 , Glu11 , Asp34 , Lys36 and Glu38 ( Cof1 - 5 and Cof1 - 9 ) , which do not appear to play an important role in F - actin binding or depolymerization , but whose mutation can result in inviability or temperature sensitivity for growth at high temperatures , also cluster close to each other ( Figure 7 , orange ) . The residues that are altered in mutants with markedly decreased F - actin binding and depolymerization form a half - circle along the edge of coﬁlin ( Figure 7 , red ) . Interestingly , only three out of ﬁve mutants showing defects in F - actin binding and depolymerization ( i . e . Cof1 - 17 , Cof1 - 20 and Cof1 - 28 , but not Cof1 - 16 and Cof1 - 22 ) also show defects in actin monomer binding . Finally , it is also important to note that the coﬁlin residues which are Fig . 4 . ( A ) Representative co - sedimentation data . The assay was performed by mixing 2 μ M pre - polymerized yeast actin ﬁlaments with 2 μ M wild - type or mutant coﬁlin . In the wild - type coﬁlin sample ( lanes 1 and 2 , S (cid:6) supernatant and P (cid:6) pellet ) , ~ 73 % of the actin and 67 % of the coﬁlin are found in the pellet . In contrast , only 13 % of Cof1 - 28 ( M1 - G5 deletion ) pelleted . Note that the amount of actin in the pellet for this mutant was higher than for wild - type coﬁlin ( 85 % for the Cof1 - 28 mutant compared with 73 % for the wild type ) . Cof1 - 12 , which shows no phenotype in yeast , co - sediments with actin ﬁlaments similarly to the wild - type coﬁlin ( lanes 3 and 4 ) . ( B ) The coﬁlin / actin molar ratios in the pellet from two independent co - sedimentation experiments using 2 μ M actin and 2 μ M coﬁlin . Ratios were determined by densitometry of Coomassie - stained SDS - gels like the one shown in Figure 4A . Note that Cof1 - 5 ( D10A , E11A ) , Cof1 - 9 ( D34A , K36A , E38A ) and Cof1 - 12 ( E55A , K56A ) show similar afﬁnity for actin ﬁlaments as the wild - type coﬁlin . The other six mutants show variable defects in F - actin binding . ( C ) Co - sedimentation of coﬁlin / coﬁlin mutants with 0 , 2 , 4 or 6 μ M actin in F - buffer . The coﬁlin concentration in these experiments was 2 μ M and the concentration of coﬁlin that co - sedimented with actin ﬁlaments is shown on the y - axis . 5524 Mutational analysis of yeast coﬁlin coﬁlin , and therefore represent a signiﬁcant coverage of the molecular surface . Ten of the coﬁlin mutations caused either conditional - lethal or lethal phenotypes in vivo . Biochemical characterization of mutant coﬁlins revealed that seven of these mutations decrease actin ﬁlament binding and / or depolymerization activity without affecting protein stability ( Table II ) . Previous site - directed muta - genesis studies have shown that Lys112 and Lys114 in porcine coﬁlin ( corresponding to Arg96 and Lys98 in yeast coﬁlin ) are important for F - actin binding and depoly - merization activities ( Moriyama et al . , 1992 ) . Cross - linking studies by Sutoh and Mabuchi ( 1989 ) have also implicated the N - terminal segment of destrin ( residues 1 – 20 ) in interactions with actin . Our studies conﬁrm the role of Arg96 and Lys98 ( Cof1 - 17 ) and the N - terminal region of coﬁlin ( Cof1 - 28 ) in F - actin binding and depolymeriz - ation and show that these regions are also essential for G - actin binding . The ﬁrst ﬁve amino acids of yeast coﬁlin , Fig . 5 . Interaction of coﬁlins with G - actin - ATP was determined by the inhibition of actin nucleotide exchange . The reaction rates are which are disordered in the crystal structure ( Fedorov indicated on the y - axis as the inverse of the reaction half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) . et al . , 1997 ) , are particularly important for these activities The ﬁnal actin concentration for each reaction was 2 μ M and the ( Table II ) . concentrations of coﬁlins are indicated on the x - axis . Our systematic mutagenesis also revealed that several previously untested regions of coﬁlin are important for these activities : mutants Cof1 - 16 ( R80A , K82A ) and Cof1 - 22 ( E134A , R135A , R138A ) show severe defects in actin ﬁlament binding and depolymerization , and no detectable defects in G - actin binding . Cof1 - 20 ( D123A , E126A ) shows severe defects in inteactions with both F - and G - actin . Mutants Cof1 - 5 ( D10A , E11A ) and Cof1 - 9 ( D34A , K36A , E38A ) are very interesting because , despite causing severe phenotypes in vivo , they show no defects in F - of G - actin binding and show only small defects in F - actin depolymerization in vitro . It is possible that the phenotypes of these two mutants result from a currently unrecognized activity of coﬁlin . Earlier studies using synthetic peptides to inhibit the coﬁlin – actin interaction predicted that residues in the middle of the long α - helix of coﬁlin ( 122 – 128 in human Fig . 6 . Representative kinetic data from actin depolymerization assay coﬁlin ; 106 – 112 in yeast coﬁlin ) might play an important induced by dilution of F - actin samples . Actin ﬁlament role in actin ﬁlament binding ( Yonezawa et al . , 1989b ) . depolymerization was followed for 3 min at 25°C by the decrease in However , our results suggest that the charged residues in light - scattering at 400 nm after dilution of 5 μ M F - actin with buffer this region of yeast coﬁlin are not critical for the coﬁlin – containing coﬁlin to ﬁnal concentrations of 0 . 5 μ M coﬁlin to 0 . 5 μ M actin interaction in vivo ( see Table I for cof1 - 18 and cof1 - F - actin . The spontaneous depolymerization of F - actin ( no coﬁlin ) and F - actin depolymerization stimulated by wild - type coﬁlin were 19 ) . One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that monitored in parallel for each mutant sample . the heptapeptide used by Yonezawa et al . , ( 1989b ) is highly charged ( DAIKKKL ) and could therefore interact with actin or coﬁlin in a non - speciﬁc manner . Peptide not important for protein stability , but which are important for viability and growth at high temperatures , are located concentrations in a millimolar range were required to inhibit the coﬁlin – actin interaction in this study , further close to the most highly conserved , solvent - accessible hydrophobic residues ( Figure 7 , purple ; Val40 , Val41 , suggesting that the peptide – actin interaction might have been non - speciﬁc . Met99 and Val100 ) . Solvent - exposed hydrophobic residues that are conserved in evolution are in general located in Based on the structural homology between coﬁlin and gelsolin segment - 1 , it has been hypothesized that coﬁlin the areas involved in protein – protein interactions ( Janin et al . , 1988 ) . This provides support for our model , in and gelsolin segment - 1 might interact with actin in a similar manner ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ) . However , the which these surfaces participate in essential interactions with actin and / or other proteins . actin - binding interface of coﬁlin indentiﬁed in our studies is distinct from the actin - binding surface of gelsolin segment - 1 , identiﬁed from a segment - 1 – actin co - crystal Discussion structure ( McLaughlin et al . , 1993 ) .

The scoring for F - actin binding is based on the [ coﬁlin ] / [ actin ] ratio in the pellets as shown in Figure 4B ( (cid:3) 80 % (cid:6) (cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) , 30 – 80 % (cid:6) (cid:4)(cid:4) and (cid:2) 30 % (cid:6) (cid:4) ) . The depolymerization and G - actin binding data tabulated here are derived from experiments shown in Figures 6 and 5 , respectively , except that the F - actin depolymerization data for the Cof1 - 5 and Cof1 - 22 mutants were taken from Lappalainen and Drubin ( 1997 ) . Note that Cof1 - 8 ( K23A , K24A , K26A ) aggregated when expressed in E . coli , and therefore the actin binding and depolymerization assays were not carried out for this mutant . cof1 - 12 ( E55A , K56A ) , which shows no phenotype in yeast , is indistinguishable from the wild - type coﬁlin in our biochemical assays . Fig . 7 . Space - ﬁlling model of the yeast coﬁlin in two different orientations ( rotated 180° horizontally ) showing the locations of the coﬁlin mutations in the three - dimensional structure of coﬁlin . The residues that can be replaced with alanines without a discernible phenotype in yeast are colored green . The mutations that resulted in altered stability of the protein are shown in blue ( cof1 - 8 and cof1 - 14 ) . The cof1 - 5 and cof1 - 9 alleles ( orange ) do not show defects in stability or F - actin binding , but have small but reproducible defects in the F - actin depolymerization assay . cof1 - 16 , cof1 - 17 , cof1 - 20 and cof1 - 22 ( red ) result in defects in both F - actin binding and depolymerization . Only cof1 - 17 , cof1 - 20 and cof1 - 28 show signiﬁcant defects in the G - actin binding assay . Note that the residues Met1 – Gly5 ( Cof1 - 28 ) , that are disordered in the crystal structure , are probably located close in space to the residues that are mutated in the cof1 - 17 allele . The conserved , surface - exposed hydrophobic residues ( Val40 , Val41 , Met99 and Val100 ) are shown in purple . important for G - actin binding ( Table III ) . In contrast , the with the actin monomer , further indicating that these two proteins do not interact with actin in similar manner . actin - binding site of gelsolin segment - 1 is located primar - ily along and proximal to the long α - helix present in While gelsolin segment - 1 only binds to G - actin , other segments of gelsolin ( e . g . segments 2 and 3 ) bind to F - actin gelsolin segment - 1 and coﬁlin , and the gelsolin residues involved in contacting actin have a different spatial distri - ( for review see Weeds and Maciver , 1993 ) . Therefore , it is formally possible that these other segments , which show bution compared with those in coﬁlin ( Figure 8A and B ) . These results are consistent with the observation that , signiﬁcant sequence homology and therefore structural homology to segment - 1 , might interact with F - actin via a unlike coﬁlin , gelsolin segment - 1 does not bind to or depolymerize actin ﬁlaments ( reviewed by Weeds and binding surface similar to that identiﬁed for coﬁlin . It is possible that a more extended surface of coﬁlin is Maciver , 1993 ) . Coﬁlin and gelsolin segment - 1 show essentially no sequence conservation in the regions that required for F - actin binding than is needed for G - actin binding to allow interactions with neighbouring subunits are important for the interaction of gelsolin segment - 1 5526 Mutational analysis of yeast coﬁlin Table III .

The side - chains of coﬁlin residues that appear vertebrate coﬁlin / ADF that can be phosphorylated in vivo , to be important for F - actin binding are indicated by red . The gelsolin by alanine caused no readily detectable phenotype in yeast residues that are important for G - actin - interaction ( right - hand panel , red ) are taken from the segment - 1 – actin monomer co - crystal structure ( Table I ) . This indicates either that in contrast to vertebrates ( McLaughin et al . , 1993 ) . yeast coﬁlin is not phosphorylated at this serine , or that phosphorylation does not play an essential role during the haploid life cycle . The inability to detect a phosphorylated within actin ﬁlaments . This hypothesis is supported by form of yeast coﬁlin ( P . Lappalainen , unpublished observ - the fact that only three out of ﬁve coﬁlin mutants that ations ; J . Bamburg , personal communication ) supports the showed defects in F - actin binding showed signiﬁcant former possibility . In light of these results , it is possible defects in our G - actin binding assays ( Figure 5 and Table that regulation of coﬁlin by phosphorylation is unique to II ) . These three mutants cluster close to each other around the beginning of the long α - helix . It is possible that when organisms and cell types in which stimulus - responsive bound to an actin ﬁlament , residues mutated in Cof1 - 17 , inactivation of actin ﬁlament depolymerization is required Cof1 - 20 and Cof1 - 28 alleles interact with one monomer , to stabilize speciﬁc actin ﬁlament populations . Neverthe - whereas residues mutated in Cof1 - 16 and Cof1 - 22 alleles less , the lethal phenotype of the Ser4Glu mutation in yeast interact with an adjacent monomer in the actin ﬁlament . coﬁlin suggests that phosphorylation of this residue in yeast would similarly disrupt the interaction between Function and regulation of coﬁlin in yeast coﬁlin and F - actin . Recent studies have shown that members of the coﬁlin / Despite evidence that regulation of coﬁlin by phos - ADF family stimulate actin ﬁlament depolymerization in phorylation is not required for vegetative growth in yeast , extracts and in vivo , and are key regulators of actin our data shed light on the mechanism of this regulation dynamics ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , in other organisms . In principle , phosphorylation of Ser3 1997 ; Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ) . Results from our systematic in vertebrate cells might inactivate coﬁlin / ADF by one of mutagenesis support the conclusion that coﬁlin plays an at least two different mechanisms . First , it is possible that essential role in regulation of actin organization . All the phosphate group at Ser3 could interact with positively three coﬁlin mutants resulting in a temperature - sensitive charged residues that are essential for F - actin binding ( e . g . phenotype in yeast show severe defects in organization of Lys112 and Lys114 in porcine coﬁlin ) , thereby disrupting the actin cytoskeleton . In contrast , coﬁlin mutants that the coﬁlin – actin interaction . Alternatively , Ser3 itself could grew normally at temperatures between 14°C and 37°C be positioned within a critical actin - binding sequence , and did not show severe defects in actin organization ( Table therefore the introduction of a phosphate group at this I ) . In addition , since two of our mutants ( Cof1 - 16 and position would prevent this region from interacting with Cof1 - 22 ) whose mutations resulted in lethality or temper - actin . Our data show that the N - terminal region of yeast ature sensitivity , respectively , appeared defective in F - actin coﬁlin is critical for both actin binding and depolymeriz - binding but not G - actin binding , we conclude that the ation . The removal of this segment does not effect overall F - actin binding activity coﬁlin is critical for its essential protein stability ( as expected , since there is no precedent function . These and other data ( Lappalainen and Drubin , for a disordered protein terminus affecting a compact 1997 ) suggest that F - actin binding and stimulation of actin globular domain ) . Since conservation of the N - terminus ﬁlament depolymerization are essential functions of coﬁlin of coﬁlin / ADF extends to yeast coﬁlin , which appears not in yeast , and most likely in all eukaryotic cells . to be phosphorylated , we suggest that the evolutionary Coﬁlin and ADF are negatively regulated by phos - conservation of this region reﬂects its importance in actin phorylation in many vertebrate cell types ( Morgan et al . , binding , rather than its role as a kinase / phosphatase 1993 ; Davidson and Haslam , 1994 ; Saito et al . , 1994 ; recognition sequence . We further speculate that upon Samstag et al . , 1996 ) . Phosphorylation of coﬁlin / ADF binding to actin , the coﬁlin N - terminus adopts a unique sharply reduces its ability to interact with F - actin ( Agnew conformation , and that in more complex eukaryotes et al . , 1995 ) and may play an essential role in the early phosphorylation of Ser3 inhibits the interaction of this stages of development in Xenopus ( Abe et al . , 1996 ) .

After 60 min of polymerization , 5 μ l of 20 μ M coﬁlin or coﬁlin mutant proteins in F - buffer were mixed with F - actin samples and Yeast strain construction The cultivation and manipulation of yeast strains followed standard incubated at room temperature for 60 min . The actin ﬁlaments were sedimented by centrifugation at 90 000 r . p . m . for 20 min at 23°C in a methods ( Rose et al . , 1990 ) . Yeast cell transformation was performed by the Li - acetate method ( Ito et al . , 1983 ) and the strains were sporulated TLA100 rotor ( Beckman Instruments ) . Equal proportions of the super - natants and pellets were loaded on 12 % SDS – polyacrylamide gels . The at 25°C in SPM medium as described by Kassir and Simchen ( 1991 ) .

Five μ l of F - actin were mixed with 40 μ l of 0 . 6 μ M coﬁlin ( in F - buffer ) in a quartz ﬂuorometer cuvette with a et al . , 1993 ) . The cells were plated on media selective for the LEU2 auxotrophic marker and grown for 3 days at 25°C . The colonies were 3 mm light path ( Hellma ) . Actin ﬁlament depolymerization was followed by monitoring the decrease in light - scattering at 400 nm in a F - 4010 replica - plated onto selective media to identify transformants in which the gain of the LEU2 marker was accompanied by the loss of the HIS3 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer ( Hitachi ) . In order to reduce noise in the spectra , all solutions used for these experiments were clariﬁed by marker . Approximately 15 % of the Leu (cid:4) transformants were unable to grow on media selective for His (cid:4) . Cells from two such colonies were centrifugation for 2 min , at 14 000 g . sporulated and six tetrads from each were dissected on YPD plates at 20°C .
