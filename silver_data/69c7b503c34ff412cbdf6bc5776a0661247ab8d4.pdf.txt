LETTERS Rapid spine stabilization and synaptic enhancement at the onset of behavioural learning Todd F . Roberts 1 , Katherine A . Tschida 1 , Marguerita E . Klein 1 & Richard Mooney 1 Behavioural learning depends onthe brain’s capacity to respond to instructive experience and is often enhanced during a juvenile sensitive period . How instructive experience acts on the juvenile brain to trigger behavioural learning remains unknown . In vitro studies show that forms of synaptic strengthening thought to underlie learning are accompanied by an increase in the stability , number and size of dendritic spines , which are the major sites of excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate brain 1 – 7 . In vivo imaging studies in sensory cortical regions reveal that these struc - tural features can be affected by disrupting sensory experience and that spine turnover increases during sensitive periods for sensory map formation 8 – 12 . These observations support two hypotheses : first , the increased capacity for behavioural learning during a sensitive period is associated with enhanced spine dynamics on sensorimotor neurons important for the learned behaviour ; second , instructive experience rapidly stabilizes and strengthens these dynamic spines . Here we report a test of these hypotheses using two - photon in vivo imaging to measure spine dynamics in zebra finches , which learn to sing by imitating a tutor song during a juvenile sensitive period 13 , 14 . Spine dynamics were measured in the forebrain nucleus HVC , the proximal site where auditory information merges with an explicit song motor representa - tion 15 – 19 , immediately before and after juvenile finches first experi - enced tutor song 20 . Higher levels of spine turnover before tutoring correlated with a greater capacity for subsequent song imitation . In juveniles with high levels of spine turnover , hearing a tutor song led to the rapid ( 24 - h ) stabilization , accumulation and enlarge - ment of dendritic spines in HVC . Moreover , in vivo intracellular recordings made immediately before and after the first day of tutoring revealed robust enhancement of synaptic activity in HVC . These findings suggest that behavioural learning results when instructive experience is able to rapidly stabilize and strengthen synapses on sensorimotor neurons important for the control of the learned behaviour . Investigating structural correlates of song learning requires repeated imaging of dendritic structure as a juvenile bird learns to sing . Weusedlentivirus / greenfluorescentprotein ( GFP ) constructsto label neurons fluorescently 21 , 22 , retrograde tracers to localize the boundaries of HVC and two - photon microscopy to image dendritic spines on individual HVC neurons through a surgically implanted cranialwindowin male zebrafinches ( Fig . 1a ) .

Therefore , viral label - ling of HVC neurons with GFP combined with two - photon imaging offersa means of examiningrapidlearning - related structural changes to sensorimotor neurons . Songbirds learn to sing during a juvenile sensitive period by memorizing a tutor song ( sensory learning ) and using auditory feed - back to match their own song to this memorized model ( sensorimo - tor learning ) . In juvenile male zebra finches , sensory learning occurs during the period , 30 – 60d after hatching and sensorimotor learning occurs during the period , 45 – 90d after hatching 13 , 14 . To examine whether experience with a tutor affects spine dynamics in HVC , spine turnover levels were quantified in juveniles raised without access to a tutor . Initial experiments focused on untutored 60 - d juveniles , an age when zebra finches raised with a tutor become refractory to copy - ing new song models 13 . Imaging HVC neurons in untutored 60 - d birds revealed a wide range of spine turnover levels , with some birds ( six of 14 ) exhibiting levels substantially higher ( . 2 s . d . ) than in age - matchedjuvenilesraisedwithatutor , andothers ( eightof14 ) showing levelssimilar ( 6 1 s . d . ) tothecontrolanimals ( Fig . 2a ) . One possibility is that this variation reflects individual differences in when the sensi - tive period for sensory learning ends . To test this idea , we quantified spine turnover in 45 - d and 90 - d untutored birds as well as age - matched birds raised with a tutor . Spine turnover in all untutored 45 - d birds was significantly higher than in age - matched control birds ( P , 0 . 01 ) and overlapped with the upper end of the turnover distri - bution in untutored 60 - d birds . By contrast , spine turnover in all untutored 90 - d birds was in the range of age - matched control birds ( P 5 0 . 3 ) and overlapped with the lower end of the turnover distri - bution in untutored 60 - d birds . These observations support the idea that tutor experience acts during early stages of normal development to decrease spine turnover in HVC , while also showing that spine turnover can eventually decrease even in the absence of tutor experi - ence . Because untutored birds use auditory feedback to learn and stabilize their ‘isolate’ songs , this transition to lower levels of turnover may reflect a commitment to a vocal behaviour learned in reference to an innate model . In this light , the transition to low levels of spine turnover in untutored birds could reflect a diminished ability to learn from a tutor . If this view is correct , then the variable levels of turnover in untutored 60 - d birds would be expected to correlate with the ability to copy a tutor song . To test this idea , we exposed previously untutored 60 - d juveniles ( N 5 14 ) to either a live tutor or operant tutoring methods for three consecutive days and tracked their song development into adulthood . Consistent with prior observations 26 , delayed tutoring resulted in a wide range of song - learning outcomes , with some birds copying elements from the tutor song ( an increase of up to 37 . 8 % in similarity to the tutor song by adulthood ) and other birds copying little or not at all ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Spine turnover levels measured in HVC before tutoring correlated positively with the subsequent increase in similarity of the pupil’s song to the tutor ( P 5 0 . 02 ; correlation coefficient , r 5 0 . 63 ) . Therefore , the capacity for learning a new behaviour is associated with enhanced spine dynamics in sensorimotor circuits important for that behaviour . The observations that the capacity for song learning is associated with enhanced spine dynamics in HVC and that spine turnover in all untutored 45 - d birds was significantly higher than in age - matched controls suggest that experience of tutor song resulting in learning may stabilize dendritic spines in HVC . To test this idea , we repeatedly imagedthesamedendriticregionsinHVCatleastonenightbeforeandonenightafterthefirstdayofexposuretotutorsong ( N 5 8 , asubsetof the14untutored60 - dbirdsdescribedpreviously ; Fig . 2b ) . Fiveof these birds , termed high - turnover birds ( HTBs ) , displayed pre - tutoring levels of spine turnover . 2s . d . higher than in age - matched controls , and the other three , termed low - turnover birds ( LTBs ) , displayed pre - tutoring levels of spine turnover commensurate to controls . In all five HTBs , spine turnover in HVC decreased significantly by the night following the first day of either live ( N 5 3 ) or operant ( N 5 2 ) tutoring ( P , 0 . 01 ; Fig . 3a ) . The finding that decreased spine turnover could occur with operant tutoring indicates that these structural effects did not depend on social interactions with the tutor , and instead are related to hearing a tutor song . Furthermore , in one live - tutoring experiment , the tutor failed to sing until the third day after it was housed with the juvenile . Notably , spine turnover only decreased after the tutor began to sing ( Fig . 3b ) , further underscoring the importance of auditory rather than social experience in triggering structural changes in HVC . Moreover , in this live - tutored juvenile , it was possible to repeatedly image the same dendritic regions for 30 d following tutor exposure , a period encompassing the remainder of sensorimotor learning . In this case , the decrease in turnover over the first 48 h after tutoring accounted for the bulk ( 67 % ) of the decrease that occurred during sensorimotor learning ( Fig . 3b ) . In addition to displaying rapid spine stabilization , four of five HTBs had increased spine density the night following the first day of tutoring ( P 5 0 . 03 ; Fig . 3c , d and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , LTBs showed no changes in either spine turnover or spine density following live or operant tutoring ( Fig . 3a , d ) . Finally , increased syllable entropy vari - ance , which is an early indicator of song imitation , was detected in HTBs but not LTBs by the end of the first day of tutoring ( post hoc Tukey test , significance threshold ( a ) of 0 . 05 in three of four HTBs ; Fig . 3e ) , and , as adults , HTBs had copied more from their tutors than had LTBs ( HTBs , 19 . 6 6 3 . 5 % increase in similarity to the tutor over song development ; LTBs , 6 . 2 6 4 . 0 % increase ) . These findings sup - port the idea that instructive experience leads to the stabilization and accumulation of dendritic spines on sensorimotor neurons important for the learned behaviour . In other systems , increased spine stability and the accumulation of new spines have been linked to synaptic strengthening 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 . Another structural hallmark of synaptic strengthening is a dynamic increase in the volume of pre - existing ( that is , stable ) spines 1 , 8 , 27 . We tracked indi - vidual HVC dendritic spines maintained acrosspre - and post - tutoring imaging sessions and measured changes in theirfluorescence intensity , a feature monotonically related to spine volume 28 ( 81 spines , eight 20 15 10 5 45 60 90 + 0 40 10 20 30 – 10 0 5 15 20 10 Turnover ( % ) T u r n o v e r ( % ) I n c r e a s e i n s i m il a r i t y t o t u t o r s o n g ( % ) Age ( d ) a b Figure 2 | Levels of HVC dendritic spine turnover correlate with song imitation . a , Mean 2 - h HVC spine turnover levels are greater in 45 - d ( P 5 0 . 009 ) and 60 - d ( P 5 0 . 04 ) , but not 90 - d , untutoredbirds ( circles ) than in age - matched control birds ( triangles ) ( 45 - d untutored , 180 spines from sixcellsinfourbirds ; 45 - dcontrol , 621spinesfrom11cellsinthreebirds ; 60 - duntutored , 1 , 419spinesfrom17cellsin14birds ; 60 - dcontrol , 1 , 579spines from 23 cells in 16 birds ; 90 - d untutored , 188 spines from four cells in two birds ; 90 - d control , 1 , 544 spines from 23 cells in 11 birds ) .

The night following the first tutoring session , the size of stable dendriticspinesincreased by 28 % in HTBsbut remained unchangedin LTBs ( HTBs , P 5 0 . 001 ; LTBs , P 5 0 . 4 ; Fig . 4 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Additionally , before tutoring , stable dendritic spines in HTBs were52 % smaller thanin LTBs ( P 5 0 . 02 ; Fig . 4b ) , a differencethathad disappeared by the night following the first tutoring session ( P 5 0 . 3 ) . The smaller stable spines and higher levels of turnover in HTBs observed before tutoring may reflect functionally weaker excitatory synaptic connections to HVC neurons 1 , 27 . Thus , instructive experience can act on more dynamic and presumably weaker dendritic spines to increase their size , number and stability , all of which are hallmarks of functional enhancement of synaptic transmission . Indeed , tutoring rapidly enhanced synaptic activity in HVC , con - sistent with the idea that structural changes to spines elicited by tutor - ing are associated with functional changes to synapses . By adapting the windowing methods used for in vivo imaging , we were able to obtainsharpintracellularrecordingsfromelectrophysiologically iden - tified projection neurons 23 in the same small region of HVC one night before and one night after a juvenile bird’s initial exposure to a tutor ( Fig . 5 ) . To maximize the likelihood that HVC dendritic spines of all birds were in a high - turnover state , experiments were conducted in , 45 - d juveniles previously raised without a tutor . Comparing spon - taneous synaptic activity recorded before and after the first day of tutoring revealed a marked increase in the amplitude of depolarizing synaptic activity ( 24 cells in three birds , P , 0 . 00001 ; Fig . 5 and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) and the emergence of prolonged ( , 1 - s ) bursts of synaptic activity . These functional changes were not paralleled by changes in resting membrane potential ( P 5 0 . 6 ) or action - potential firingrate ( P 5 0 . 3 ) . Therefore , thesynapticenhancementwasunlikely to arise from increased driving force on synaptic currents or increased firingofHVCprojectionneurons , whichareamajorsourceofsynaptic input into other HVC projection neurons . Rather , the functional and structural changes observed in HVC following tutoring are suggestive of rapid synaptic strengthening , although another mechanism that cannot be excluded is increased excitability of neurons afferent to HVC . The rapid enhancement of synaptic activity was even detected in a juvenile that failed to sing during its first tutoring session ( P , 0 . 00001 ; Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , suggesting that it could occur in the absence of vocal practice and its associated auditory feedback . Lastly , the cumulative distributions of spontaneous synaptic events recorded in HVC the night following the first tutoring session were similar to those from age - matched juveniles raised with access to a tutor ( P 5 0 . 1 ; Supplementary Fig . 4b ) , consistent with the idea that tutoring results in a rapid physiological strengthening of initially weaker synaptic inputs into HVC projection neurons . a b c 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 R e l a t i v e s p i n e fl u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y * * * * * NS 60 – 60 40 – 40 20 – 20 0 HTBs LTBs N o r m a li z e d fl u o r e s ce n ce i n t e n s i t y p o s t - t u t o r i n g P o s t - t u t o r i n g P r e - t u t o r i n g P o s t - t u t o r i n g P r e - t u t o r i n g Pre - tutoring Post - tutoring Figure 4 | Tutoringtriggersenlargement ofstabledendriticspinesinHVC . a , Example of two stable spines ( blue arrowheads ) that exhibited increased fluorescence intensity following tutoring , indicating an increase in dendritic spine volume 28 .

All rights reserved ©2010 Our findings show that behavioural learning is favoured when instructive experience rapidly stabilizes structurally dynamic dend - ritic spines and enhances synaptic activity of sensorimotor neurons , thereby forging a link between experience , structural and functional properties of synapses , and behavioural learning . Prior studies in juvenile mammals established that the quality of sensory experience can affect the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in the corres - ponding regions of sensory cortex 9 , 11 . Our findings show that the consequences of a single instructive signal—a tutor song—are rapidly manifested as structural changes to dendritic spines as well as functional changes to synapses in HVC , a sensorimotor region important for the control of learned vocalizations 18 . A variety of evidence implicates HVC as the source of precise timing signals for song patterning 19 , the source of corollary discharge signals harnessed to allow song imitation 15 , and as a primary site where auditory signals merge with these song motor representations 15 , 16 , 19 . The location of HVC at the sensorimotor interface suggests that the large - scale struc - tural changes to dendritic spines we observed following tutoring can have direct consequences for how the HVC network translates audi - tory and motor - related activity into song . Consistent with this view , tutoring rapidly enhanced spontaneous synaptic activity in HVC and also led to rapid changes in vocal behaviour . Moreover , spontaneous bursting activity in song premotor neurons immediately down - stream of HVC has been found to increase drastically during the initial stages of tutor - song imitation 29 , a functional change that is likely to be the consequence of the structural and functional changes occurring in HVC . Overall , our findings suggest experience can act in the juvenile brain to rapidly stabilize and strengthen a structurally dynamic sensorimotor network , providing a foundation for learning new behaviours . METHODS SUMMARY We raised juvenile male zebra finches either in isolation from an adult song model ( isolates ) or with normal access to adult male song ( controls ) . We used repeated in vivo two - photon optical imaging in the sensorimotor song nucleus HVC to assess structural plasticity of dendritic spines before and after the onset of song learning . Lentivirus coding for enhanced GFP injected 14 – 20d before cranial windowing was combined with retrograde labelling of HVC projection neurons to genetically label and identify HVC neurons for in vivo two - photon laser scanning microscopy ( Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope , Tsunami Ti : sapphire laser ( Spectra - Physics ) at 910nm , 3 40 infrared Zeiss Achroplan objective ) . Changes in turnover , density and fluorescence intensity of dendritic spines on HVC projections neurons were calculated ( Methods ) using data from 2 - h imaging sessions ( total of 7 , 048 spines from 103 cells in 61 birds ) . We used sharp intracellular recordings from electrophysiologically - identified HVC pro - jection neurons made the night before and the night after initial exposure to a song model to analyse associated changes to synaptic activity ( Methods ) . To quantify song learning , we measured how much the pupil’s song gained in similarity to the tutor over song development using percentage similarity score inSOUNDANALYSISPRO1 . 04a ( adultpercentagesimilarityminuspre - tutoring percentagesimilarity ; http : / / ofer . sci . ccny . cuny . edu / sound _ analysis _ pro ) .

All birds were placed on reverse day – night cycles ( 14h of light , 10h of darkness ) $ 15d before imaging . Control birds were raised in our breeding colony and givenfullaccesstoadulttutorsuntil $ 43dafterhatching . Experimentaljuvenile zebrafincheswereisolatedfromadultmaletutorsby10dafterhatchingandthenhousedinnestinggroupsandcaredforbytwoadultfemalezebrafinchesorfemaleBengalesefinches . Beginning at , 45d ( 40 – 50d after hatching ) , juvenile males from the nesting groups were separated and housed individually in visual isolation from each other until adulthood ( 115 – 130d ) . Some of these juvenile birds were then tutored beginning on day 60 ( 59 – 62d after hatching ) . For tutoring , juvenile birds were allowed to trigger playback of the song of an adult zebrafinch or wereintroducedtoanadult malezebrafinchstartingthe morning following the initial night of imaging . Birds were given access to key - peck - triggered tutoring or a live singing tutor for three consecutive days . Vocaliza - tions of juvenile birds subjected to delayed tutoring were recorded continuously using automated methods ( SOUND ANALYSIS PRO1 . 04a ; http : / / ofer . sci . ccny . cuny . edu / sound _ analysis _ pro ) . Songs were recorded daily beginning 2 – 7d before and ending $ 3d after tutoring , and then were recorded either continu - ously or semi - continuously ( every 3 – 10d ) into adulthood . Viralandtracerinjections . Weanaesthetizedmalezebrafinchesusingisoflurane inhalation ( 2 % ) and placed them in a stereotaxic apparatus . Injection target sites were located using stereotaxic coordinates and multi - unit neural recordings . A glass pipette attached to a pressure injection unit ( Drummond Nanoject II ) was used to deliver the lentivirus , expressing enhanced GFP under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat ( FRGW ) 21 , to HVC . Similar methods were used to deliver the neuronal retrograde tracer Fast Blue to area X and Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated dextran amines to RA ( lentivirus : 32 . 2nl per injection and , 30 injections , for a total of , 1 m l ; tracers : 32 . 2nl per injection and 2 – 5 injec - tions ) . Lentiviral injections were made 15 – 20d before imaging and retrograde tracer injections were made 5 – 7d before imaging to optimize labelling of HVC neurons . In vivo two - photon imaging . We longitudinally imaged dendritic spines on GFP - expressingHVCneuronsinmalezebrafinchesaged41 – 130d ( 7 , 048spines , 61 birds ; Supplementary Table1 ) . Birds were injected with mannitol ( 10 m lg 2 1 , intramuscular ) , anaesthetized by isoflurane inhalation ( 2 % ) and positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus . The scalp overlying HVC was removed and the scalp margins were sealed to the surface of the skull using Vetbond ( n - butyl cyanoa - crylate ) . Bilateral craniotomies ( , 1 – 1 . 5mm 2 ) were made in the skull overlying HVC . The dura mater was excised , leaving intact the pia mater , the 60 – 150 - m m - thick layer of neural tissue and the lateral telencephalic ventricle overlying HVC . A custom - cut coverslip ( no . - 1 thickness ) was placed directly on the pial surface or on a thin layer of agarose covering the brain , then sealed to the skull with dental acrylic . A head post was also affixed to the skull with dental acrylic . Birds were placed onto a custom stage under a Zeiss LSM510 two - photon laser scan - ning microscope . Only GFP - labelled neurons located within a field of retro - gradely labelled HVC RA and / or HVC X neurons were classified as HVC neurons and imaged . Dendritic segments of HVC neurons were imaged at high resolution during the bird’s subjective night time ( 1024 3 1024 pixels , 76 3 76 m m 2 , 3 . 2 m s per pixel , averaging two samples per pixel with 1 - m m z steps , focused through a 3 40 , NA0 . 8 Zeiss IR - Achroplan immersion objective ) . Birds were returned to a darkened holding cage and allowed to sleep until being re - imaged 2h later . Two - hour imaging sessions were repeated during the same period each night for 1 – 5 nights . Image analysis . Three - dimensional image stacks were auto - aligned and smoothed using a Gaussian filter ( IMAGEJ ; http : / / rsbweb . nih . gov / ij / ) and the same dendritic segment , imaged twice with a 2 - h or 24 - h interval , was selected . Images exhibiting changes in fluorescence or rotational artefacts were excluded from further analysis . All sets of selected three - dimensional image stacks were coded and scored by researchers blind to the experimental condition . To assess spinegrowthandretraction , wecomparedindividualdendriticspinesacross2 - h time intervals and calculated spine stability ( 100 N stable / N total ) , spine elimination ( 100 N lost / N total ) , spine addition ( 100 N gained / N total ) and spine turnover ( 100 ( N gained 1 N lost ) / 2 N total ) , where N stable is the number of spines that were stableoverthe2 - hinterval , N lost isthenumberofspineslostoverthe2 - hinterval , N gained is the number of spines gained over the 2 - h interval and N total is the total number of spines from the first imaging time point . Changes in spine density ( N total divided by dendritic length in micrometres ) and spine fluorescence intensity were measured from the same dendritic segments used to assess spine turnover . Spine fluorescence intensity ( integrated GFP intensity ) was measured by summing all pixels for a dendritic spine , subtraction - corrected for the mean background fluorescence measured from a non - labelled region of equal area located adjacent to the dendritic spine . This value was normalized by dividing by the mean dendritic fluorescence measured on a segment of dendrite at the base of the spine , subtraction - corrected for the background fluorescence . Standardnon - parametricandparametricstatisticalmethodswereusedtodetect significant differences ( a 5 0 . 05 ) . Repeated intracellular recording . Sharp intracellular recordings were made on two consecutive nights from the same small location in HVC using repeated electrode penetrations through the same opening in the dura . During recording sessions , birds were lightly anaesthetized with diazepam ( 50 m l , 2 . 5mgml 2 1 ) . Electrode impedances were 100 – 150M V when filled with 2M KAc . Between nightly recording sessions , the craniotomy overlying HVC was filled with sili - cone oil ( Advance Weight Systems ) and covered with a glass coverslip and a silicone adhesive ( Kwik - Sil , World Precision Instruments ) . Intracellular electro - physiological data was captured as previously described 23 . Briefly , recordings were amplified using an AxoClamp 2B amplifier ( Axon Instruments ) , low - pass filtered at 3kHz and digitized at 10kHz . Analysis of depolarizing postsynaptic potential amplitudes from spontaneous electrical activity was conducted on median - filtered traces using custom event detection software ( written by K . Hamaguchi using MATLAB , version 2009 ) . Behaviouralanalysis . Wequantifiedtheamountthatjuvenilebirdscopiedfrom their tutor using the percentage similarity score in SOUND ANALYSIS PRO . Acoustic similarity is calculated by measuring ‘pitch’ , amplitude modulation , frequency modulation , Weiner entropy and goodness of pitch . This aggregate score reflects the percentage of elements in the pupil’s song that are similar to thoseinthetutor’ssong . Wefirstcalculatedhowmuchthepupilcopiedfromthe tutor by analysing similarity scores from recordings of the pupils’ adult song ( 115 – 130d ) . Next we measured how similar the pupil song was to the tutor immediately before tutor exposure ( 58 – 59d ) , by retrospectively identifying syllable clusters in the juvenile song that were proto - syllables for the adult song motif ( n < 45 comparisons per bird per time point ) . From these measurements , we calculated how much the pupil gained in similarity to the tutor over song development ( adult percentage similarity minus pre - tutoring percentage simi - larity ) . This approach was used instead of absolute similarity because some juvenile songs before tutor exposure ( 58 – 60d ) were sufficiently structured to return spuriously high similarities to a tutor song . To measure the onset of changes in song with tutoring , we calculated the entropy variance , which is a measureofsong complexityandanearlyindicatoroftutor - songimitation 20 , 26 , 29 , of identified proto - syllable clusters from afternoon recording sessions , starting 2d before tutoring and during the 3d of tutoring . doi : 10 . 1038 / nature08759 Macmillan Publishers Limited .
