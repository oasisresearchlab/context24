Tuft cells are a rare epithelial cell type found in diverse epithelia , 60 where they play important roles in sensing antigens and stimulating downstream immune 61 responses . Exhibiting a unique polarized morphology , tuft cells are defined by an array of giant 62 actin filament bundles that support ~ 2 μm of apical membrane protrusion and extend over 7 μm 63 towards the cell’s perinuclear region . Despite their established roles in maintaining intestinal 64 epithelial homeostasis , tuft cells remain understudied due to their rarity ( e . g . ~ 1 % in the small 65 intestinal epithelium ) . Details regarding the ultrastructural organization of the tuft cell cytoskeleton , 66 the molecular components involved in building the array of giant actin bundles , and how these 67 cytoskeletal structures support tuft cell biology remain unclear . 68 69 Methods : To begin to answer these questions , we used advanced light and electron microscopy 70 to perform quantitative morphometry of the small intestinal tuft cell cytoskeleton . 71 72 Results : We found that tuft cell core bundles consist of actin filaments that are crosslinked in a 73 parallel “barbed - end out” configuration . These polarized structures are also supported by a unique 74 group of tuft cell enriched actin - binding proteins that are differentially localized along the giant 75 core bundles . Furthermore , we found that tuft cell actin bundles are co - aligned with a highly 76 ordered network of microtubules . 77 78 Conclusions : Tuft cells assemble a cytoskeletal superstructure that is well positioned to serve 79 as a track for subcellular transport along the apical - basolateral axis and in turn , support the 80 dynamic sensing functions that are critical for intestinal epithelial homeostasis . 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 4 INTRODUCTION 90 Epithelial tissues are composed of a diverse array of cell types including transporting , sensory , 91 and secretory cells , which work together to support physiological homeostasis . However , not all 92 cell types are equally represented within the epithelium , and certain populations are extremely 93 rare . One such rare cell type is the tuft cell ( e . g . less than 1 % of cells in the small intestine ) , which 94 is broadly characterized as a chemosensory cell and found in the thymus , gastrointestinal , 95 respiratory , and urogenital tracts [ 1 - 5 ] . Perhaps because of their rarity , our understanding of their 96 basic biological features and how they support epithelial tissue physiology remain understudied . 97 Tuft cells from diverse tissues perform similar functions dependent on G - protein coupled 98 receptors ( GPCRs ) sensing ligands specific to their biological niche . In the small intestine , tuft 99 cells sense bacteria , protists , and helminths using a variety of GPCRs including succinate 100 receptor 1 and free fatty acid receptor 3 [ 6 , 7 ] . Through the canonical taste receptor pathway , 101 transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 5 ( TRPM5 ) causes an influx of 102 sodium that depolarizes the cell [ 8 ] . Downstream , in pathways that are not yet defined , 103 depolarization causes the secretion of tuft cell effectors including interleukin 25 ( IL - 25 ) , cysteinyl 104 leukotrienes ( CysLTs ) , prostaglandin D2 ( PGD2 ) , and acetylcholine ( Ach ) [ 9 - 12 ] . These effectors 105 trigger a type 2 innate lymphoid cell response which , in the intestine , results in tuft cell hyperplasia 106 and aids in the subsequent clearance of parasites and barrier maintenance [ 9 - 12 ] . Interestingly , 107 tuft cells may be heterogenous within individual tissues , with evidence for two broad subtypes . 108 Type - 1 tuft cells are classified as neuron - like and express choline acetyltransferase , an enzyme 109 required for synthesis of acetylcholine , whereas type - 2 tuft cells are classified as immune - like and 110 express immune - related genes such as pan - immune marker CD45 / Ptprc [ 13 ] . Although animal 111 studies are beginning to reveal how tuft cells contribute to epithelial physiology , the subcellular 112 mechanisms underlying tuft cell function in these diverse contexts remains poorly understood . 113 Tuft cells were first characterized by their morphology as ‘peculiar cells’ with a small apical 114 surface that presents a large ‘tuft’ of protrusions [ 14 , 15 ] . Superficially , tuft cell protrusions exhibit 115 a fingerlike morphology resembling microvilli . However , early electron microscopy ( EM ) data 116 revealed some unique features , e . g . tuft protrusions are supported by ‘giant’ actin - rich structures , 117 which protrude ~ 2 µm from the cell surface wrapped in apical membrane and extend many 118 microns deep into the cytoplasm , down to the perinuclear region [ 2 , 16 , 17 ] . These imaging 119 studies also noted microtubules beneath the tuft cell apical surface [ 18 , 19 ] , which is common for 120 polarized epithelial cell types . Interestingly , EM volume reconstructions of single tuft cells revealed 121 that the sub - apical cytoplasm contains a large ‘tubulovesicular structure’ , although any connection 122 between this structure and the cytoskeletal features alluded to above remains unclear [ 20 ] . Later 123 5 studies using light microscopy and single cell RNA sequencing ( scRNAseq ) , reported enrichment 124 of specific cytoskeletal components in tuft cells , including acetylated tubulin [ 4 ] , actin bundling 125 protein fimbrin [ 2 ] , actin and Akt binding protein girdin [ 21 ] , and actin binding protein advillin [ 22 - 126 24 ] . Advillin is part of a well characterized family of actin bundlers and has high homology ( 59 % ) 127 with villin , a major bundler in enterocyte microvilli [ 25 ] . 128 Although previous studies hinted at the unique organization and composition of the tuft 129 cytoskeleton , important questions remain unanswered . For example , the molecular mechanisms 130 that drive the formation of giant actin bundles or promote the packing of apical protrusions into a 131 tuft remain undefined . How this cytoskeletal specialization supports the physiological functions of 132 tuft cells also remains unclear . Answers to these questions will be essential for understanding 133 how tuft cells are adapted to support homeostasis through sensing and secretion . To address 134 these gaps , we leveraged quantitative light and electron microscopy , in combination with trainable 135 image segmentation , with the goal of building detailed three - dimensional views of the cytoskeletal 136 structures underlying the tuft , in tuft cells in the small intestine . To work around the problem of tuft 137 cell rarity in this tissue , we took advantage of succinate treatment to increase tuft cell specification 138 [ 26 ] . Using these approaches , we defined the organization and packing of actin filaments within 139 tuft cell protrusions , and characterized the subcellular distribution of cytoskeletal proteins that 140 exhibit tuft cell specific enrichment . Our studies identified a striking array of microtubules that 141 exhibit interdigitating co - alignment with giant actin bundles , forming a superstructure of parallel 142 cytoskeletal polymers that extend from the apical surface down to the perinuclear region . 143 Extensive decoration of this superstructure with multi - vesicular bodies and other small 144 membranous organelles suggests that this unique architecture might support vectorial transport 145 along the apical - basolateral axis . These discoveries advance our knowledge of fundamental tuft 146 cell biology and suggest models for how the unique cytoskeleton found within this rare cell type 147 might contribute to sensing and secretion , subcellular activities that are essential for intestinal 148 homeostasis . 149 150 RESULTS 151 The tuft cell ‘tuft’ contains ~ 100 giant actin bundles 152 Our review of the tuft cell literature revealed a lack of cohesive terminology for describing the sub - 153 cellular features of this unique cell type . Herein , we propose and apply a simple nomenclature 154 when referring to specific structures within the tuft , defined here as the full array of surface 155 protrusions and their supporting core actin bundles ( Figure 1A ) . Our hope is that these terms will 156 6 be adopted by others in the field to facilitate clear and coherent communication . To begin defining 157 the structural architecture of the tuft , we used confocal and super - resolution light microscopy to 158 visualize the tuft cytoskeleton . As a model for these studies , we took advantage of mouse small 159 intestinal tissue sections and whole mount preparations ; these allowed us to visualize single tuft 160 cells in both lateral and en face ( top down ) views . We first performed high - resolution confocal 161 imaging of tissue sections labeled with fluorescent phalloidin to visualize F - actin . Lateral views of 162 single tuft cells revealed arrays of long , continuous actin bundles ranging from 5 to 12 µm in length 163 ( median : 7 ) ( Figure 1B , C ) , up to ~ 10 times longer than the core bundles that support microvilli on 164 neighboring enterocytes [ 27 ] . Close inspection of the phalloidin signal along these giant actin 165 bundles revealed that they extend as a single , continuous structure from the distal end of the 166 supported protrusion , down to the perinuclear region ( Figure 1B ) . Imaging whole mount sections 167 captured just under the apical surface enabled us to define the number of actin bundles per cell 168 ( Figure 1D ) . Tuft cells contained a median of 101 core bundles ( Figure 1E ) and linescans drawn 169 along the bundle axis show that phalloidin signal tapers toward the rootlet end ( Figure 1F ) . 170 Although phalloidin intensity is generally proportional to actin filament density , whether such loss 171 of signal towards the rootlet end represents a decrease in filament number , or alternatively , 172 inhibition of phalloidin binding by enrichment of an actin - associated protein remains unclear . 173 Within the small intestine , tuft cells exhibit a fusiform ( i . e . bottle shaped ) morphology , with 174 a narrow apical surface and wider cell body [ 17 , 28 ] . To determine whether the array of core actin 175 bundles is shaped by the overall morphology of the cell , we measured the cross - sectional area of 176 the cell body relative to the area occupied by bundles , moving down from the apical surface in 177 1 . 5 µm increments ( Figure 1G ) . Right at the apical surface , bundle area and cell area are similar 178 ( Figure 1H ) , suggesting that the junctional actomyosin belt constrains bundle spacing in this 179 plane . However , both bundle area and cell area progressively increased below the apical surface , 180 although the rate of increase was higher for the cell body , indicating that the width of cell body 181 does not limit bundle spreading deeper in the cell ( Figure 1H ) . To better visualize the orientation 182 of individual bundles relative to the apicobasal axis , bundles were segmented via trainable 183 Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis ( WEKA ) segmentation [ 29 ] , thresholds were 184 applied to the generated probability maps to reduce noise ( see Methods ) , and structures were 185 then rendered in 3D ( Figure 1I ) . Bundles in these reconstructions demonstrated a median tilt of 186 81 . 1° , splaying slightly outward from the apicobasal axis ( 90° ) ( Figure 1J ) , again with narrowest 187 point of constriction right at the apical surface . We also examined the packing organization of 188 bundles within the tuft ( Figure 1K ) . Enterocyte microvilli exhibit hexagonal packing , which 189 maximizes the number of protrusions and thus , apical membrane holding capacity per cell . In the 190 7 tuft , measurements of the angle formed by groups of three adjacent protrusions revealed a 191 median of 59 . 3° suggestive of hexagonal packing , although the spread around this value was 192 large , indicating areas of fluid packing ( Figure 1L ) . To gain insight on mechanisms that constrict 193 giant actin bundle packing at the apical surface , we examined the actomyosin belt that forms at 194 the level of junctional complexes [ 30 ] . Tuft cells have long been identified by their small apical 195 profiles ( en face area ) [ 16 , 17 ] , and our measurements of en face cell surface area using tight 196 junction marker , zonula occludens 1 ( ZO - 1 ) ( Figure 1M ) , did reveal that tuft cells exhibit 197 significantly smaller and more circular apical areas than neighboring enterocytes ( Figure S1A , B ) . 198 The small radius of the tuft cell apical profile is suggestive of elevated contractility in the junctional 199 actomyosin belt [ 31 ] . Intestinal epithelial cells express three distinct non - muscle myosin - 2 200 isoforms - NM2A , NM2B , and NM2C [ 32 ] , with NM2A supporting the highest levels of contractility 201 [ 33 ] . In the case of tuft cells , en face images showed NM2A enrichment in the junctional 202 actomyosin belt ( Figure 1N ) and lateral views of tissue sections also revealed puncta enriched at 203 the level of junctional contacts ( Figure 1O ) ; a similar distribution was observed for NM2C ( Figure 204 S1C , D ) . Relative to enterocytes , tuft cells express similar levels of NM2A ( Figure S1E , F ) but 205 much lower levels of NM2C ( Figure S1G , H ) . These data suggest that the constrained diameter 206 of the tuft cell apical surface and the tuft are primarily due to a high NM2A / NM2C ratio . 207 208 Giant actin bundles contain ~ 100 hexagonally packed actin filaments 209 We next sought to define the organization of actin filaments within individual giant core actin 210 bundles . We used transmission EM ( TEM ) to collect en face cross - sectional views of the tuft , 211 which enabled us to resolve individual actin filaments in core bundles . To overcome the difficulty 212 of capturing rare tuft cells in ultrathin sections , we increased the number of tuft cells using an 213 established model of succinate - driven tuft cell hyperplasia [ 34 ] . With this approach , we found that 214 bundles ( Figure 2A ) contain ~ 100 filaments ( median : 101 . 5 ) ( Figure 2B ) , in contrast to enterocyte 215 microvilli , which contain only 20 - 30 [ 27 ] . We also noted that the distance from the core actin 216 bundle to the surrounding membrane was spaced at a median of 16 . 8 nm ( Figure 2C ) , which is 217 consistent with the dimensions of known membrane - actin linkers , including class 1 myosins [ 35 ] . 218 To further examine the arrangement of giant core bundle actin filaments , we used Fourier 219 analysis to create frequency space maps that highlight dominant spacing features . In image fields 220 containing many bundle cross - sections , Fourier maps were indicative of uniform filament - filament 221 spacing ( Figure 2D ) . Fourier patterns were also used to create a filter that was then overlayed 222 with the original image ( magenta ) , to highlight all filaments with uniform spacing ( Figure 2D ) . 223 Virtually all filaments were highlighted showing uniform spacing . Because such uniform inter - 224 8 filament spacing is typically associated with hexagonal packing patterns , we performed a similar 225 analysis on individual bundles to examine this possibility . Here , we generated Fourier filters to 226 highlight only filaments with hexagonal packing ( magenta ) ( Figure 2G ) . In all bundles analyzed , 227 the majority of actin filaments were packed hexagonally . We then used Trackmate , a FIJI plugin , 228 to identify filament center coordinates with sub - pixel precision ( Figure S2A ) . Counting nearest 229 neighbors within a 12 nm radius ( approximately twice the width of a single filament ) , it was evident 230 that hexagonally packed filaments , indicated by 6 nearest neighbors , were enriched in the center 231 of the bundle . Filaments at the edge of the bundle deviated from perfect hexagonal packing , which 232 reduced the number of nearest neighbors to 5 ( Figure S2B ) . Additionally , the angle formed by 233 groups of three neighboring filaments was close to 60° ( median : 58 . 9° ) ( Figure 2E ) , which is 234 consistent with hexagonal packing . This analysis also revealed that the mean center - to - center 235 distance between filaments was ~ 9 nm ( median : 9 . 2 nm ) ( Figure 2F ) . Finally , we noted that some 236 bundles contained packing anomalies ( dislocations ) where filaments were entirely missing ( yellow 237 arrow in Figure 2A ) , although this did not appear to disrupt the organization of filaments around 238 these voids . To visualize the filaments within giant actin bundles along their length , we examined 239 lateral tissue sections via TEM ( Figure 2H ) . Using this approach , it was difficult to capture 240 complete views of entire bundles . However , we did observe that bundle thickness and the number 241 of filaments decrease toward the rootlet ends , which is consistent with the decay in phalloidin 242 signal ( Figure 1F ) . The filament packing patterns revealed in these ultrastructural studies hold 243 implications for understanding mechanisms that drive tuft formation , as we discuss in more detail 244 below . 245 246 Filaments in giant core actin bundles exhibit uniform ‘barbed - end out’ polarity 247 Based on our TEM images , core bundle actin filaments appear to be crosslinked tightly , in parallel . 248 However , the orientation of individual filaments within these bundles has not been defined . 249 Filament orientation in this scenario is important because it will constrain models for how these 250 structures contribute to subcellular function . Bundles consisting of filaments with uniform 251 orientation are well - suited for supporting directional motor - driven transport [ 36 ] , whereas mixed 252 orientation bundles are typically associated with contractile functions [ 37 ] . To determine bundle 253 orientation , we stained mouse small intestine with epidermal growth factor receptor pathway 254 substrate 8 ( EPS8 ) , an actin binding protein that marks barbed - ends of filaments in bundles with 255 uniform orientation [ 38 ] . Previous studies established that this factor is highly enriched at the distal 256 tips of microvilli , filopodia , and stereocilia , where the barbed - ends of uniformly oriented filaments 257 reside [ 39 - 41 ] . Confocal images revealed that tuft cells do exhibit some distal tip targeting of 258 9 EPS8 , although linescan analysis showed significantly lower levels than enterocytes ( Figure 3A , 259 C ) . From this perspective , we then stained for other EPS8 - like molecules including EPS8 - like 2 260 ( EPS8L2 ) , which has a domain organization similar to EPS8 [ 42 ] . Relative to neighboring 261 enterocytes , EPS8L2 is highly enriched in tuft cells where it localizes specifically to the distal tips 262 of apical protrusions ( Figure 3B , C ) . Analysis of single cell RNAseq data also confirmed the higher 263 level of enrichment for EPS8L2 vs . EPS8 in tuft cells ( Figure S3A , B ) . Although there is no direct 264 biochemical evidence confirming EPS8L2 as a barbed - end binder , this factor has been shown to 265 target the tips of row 2 stereocilia in hair cells of the inner ear [ 43 ] , which is consistent with barbed - 266 end binding . We also expressed an EGFP - tagged version of EPS8L2 in HeLa cells and observed 267 strong localization to the tips of filopodia ( Figure 3D ) , providing additional support for barbed - end 268 binding . Taken together , these data suggest that the tuft cell giant actin bundles are composed of 269 filaments organized with uniform ‘barbed - end out’ polarity . 270 271 Giant core actin bundles show regionalization of tuft cell enriched actin - binding proteins 272 Cells form higher - order actin structures using a vast array of actin - binding proteins , some of which 273 cross - link and stabilize filaments . For example , stereocilia core bundles contain espin - 1 , 274 fimbrin / plastin - 1 , and fascin - 2 [ 44 - 46 ] whereas enterocyte microvilli contain espin , villin , fimbrin , 275 and mitotic spindle positioning protein ( MISP ) [ 47 - 50 ] . Recent research also indicated that these 276 bundlers occupy distinct ‘neighborhoods’ relative to the ends of the bundle [ 50 , 51 ] . In tuft cells , 277 previous studies identified specific expression of actin - binding proteins including fimbrin , advillin , 278 and girdin ( Y1798 ) [ 2 , 21 , 23 , 24 ] . By screening scRNAseq datasets , we also identified additional 279 tuft cell enriched filament bundling candidates including espin and LIM domain and actin binding 280 1 ( LIMA1 ) ( Figure S3C , D ) . To better understand the localization of espin and LIMA1 within tuft 281 cells , we used super - resolution Zeiss Airyscan microscopy to image immunostained tissue 282 sections . For spatial points of reference , samples were also stained with phalloidin to highlight all 283 F - actin in the tuft , and advillin , an established tuft cell marker [ 23 , 24 ] . Linescans were drawn 284 along individual core bundles ( from distal tip to rootlet ) and the signal intensity along that axis was 285 plotted from multiple tuft cells . Advillin displayed high level enrichment in tuft cells , with strong 286 signal at the protruding ends of giant actin bundles that decayed toward the rootlets ( Figure 4A , 287 B ) . Consistent with scRNAseq data , espin was also strongly localized to the protruding ends of 288 giant actin bundles ( Figure 4C , D & S3C ) . Interestingly , LIMA1 was uniquely restricted to the 289 rootlets and maintained a high intensity down to the most proximal ends ( Figure 4E , F ) . Thus , 290 espin and LIMA1 are newly identified components of tuft cell giant actin bundles , and the 291 10 regionalization of these factors may hold importance for understanding the function and / or 292 mechanical properties of the rootlet vs . protruding bundle segments . 293 The cylindrical morphology of surface protrusions such as microvilli is maintained by high 294 levels of linker proteins , including class 1 myosins and ezrin , which stabilize membrane - actin 295 interactions [ 52 , 53 ] . From this perspective , we sought to determine if tuft cells shared similar 296 membrane - actin linking proteins . Interestingly , scRNAseq data showed a strong enrichment of 297 myosin - 1b in tuft cells compared to enterocytes ( Figure S3E ) . As one of eight class 1 myosins 298 expressed in mice , myosin - 1b is a tension sensitive motor implicated in vesicle secretion [ 54 ] . 299 Immunostaining revealed that myosin - 1b is strongly expressed in tuft cells , where it localizes to 300 the protruding ends of giant actin bundles ( Figure 5A , B ) . Ezrin was also detected in tuft cells 301 ( Figure S3F ) and its expression was similarly restricted to the apical tuft ( Figure 5C , D ) . Ezrin is 302 autoinhibited , but it can be activated through the activity of SLK / LOK kinases , which 303 phosphorylate residue Y565 ( pEzrin ) [ 55 ] . Interestingly , whereas total ezrin levels were similar 304 between tuft cells and enterocytes , tuft cells had significantly higher levels of pEzrin in apical 305 protrusions ( Figure 5E - G ) suggesting that higher levels of membrane - cytoskeleton adhesion may 306 be needed to achieve the larger dimensions of protrusions in the tuft . Collectively , these 307 immunostaining results highlight a unique complement of actin associated factors that likely 308 cooperate to drive giant bundle assembly and organization within the tuft . 309 310 Giant actin bundles co - align and interdigitate with acetylated microtubules 311 Previous transcriptomic analysis confirmed an enrichment of tubulin in tuft cells [ 22 ] and TEM 312 imaging of ultrathin sections also noted the vertical orientation of microtubules between core actin 313 bundles [ 16 , 18 ] . Confocal microscopy using markers for tubulin or acetylated tubulin ( Ac - tubulin ) , 314 a post - translationally modified version of tubulin associated with long - lived microtubules [ 56 ] , also 315 confirmed the presence of long microtubule tracks in tuft cells [ 4 , 19 , 57 ] . Yet how microtubules in 316 the tuft are arranged relative to giant core actin bundles remains unclear . To address this , we 317 stained for Ac - tubulin in frozen tissue sections and imaged these samples using confocal 318 microscopy . Consistent with previous work , we observed that microtubules enriched in Ac - tubulin 319 were oriented along the vertical axis of tuft cell but excluded from apical protrusions ( Figure 6A ) . 320 This microtubule network also extended several microns past the rootlet ends of giant actin 321 bundles , although the overall length of both cytoskeletal networks was comparable ( Figure 6B ) . 322 Like actin filaments , microtubules are polarized polymers , and in polarized epithelial cells ( e . g . 323 enterocytes ) , they generally extend their minus ends towards the apical surface [ 58 , 59 ] . However , 324 when we stained for dynein heavy chain to mark microtubule minus ends , we unexpectedly found 325 11 that tuft cells exhibit minimal dynein enrichment at the apical surface relative to neighboring 326 enterocytes ( Figure 6C , D ) , although we noted some dynein labeling towards the perinuclear 327 compartment and strong labeling in the basolateral region ( Figure 6E ) . These data suggest that 328 tuft cells build stable microtubule arrays that extend their plus ends toward the apical surface . 329 Similar to our analysis of giant core actin bundles , we used trainable WEKA segmentation 330 to generate a 3D reconstruction of the Ac - tubulin signal in tuft cells ( Figure 6F ) . The overall 331 positioning , organization , and tilt of the microtubules ( relative to the apicobasal axis ) was 332 remarkably similar to that of giant core actin bundles ( microtubule median : 79 . 9° ; F - actin median : 333 81 . 1° ) ( Figure 6I ) , suggesting the possibility of physical interactions between these two 334 cytoskeletal networks . The strong co - alignment of giant actin bundles and Ac - tubulin signal is also 335 apparent when superimposing their reconstructions ( Figure 6G ) . To better visualize the alignment 336 of these networks , we generated a separate map showing actin bundle segments that were 337 overlapping or immediately adjacent to microtubules ( see interaction map , Figure 6H ) . It is 338 important to note that our 3D maps were drawn with conservative thresholding parameters ( see 339 Methods ) , so the full scale of microtubule - actin overlap or contact may be underestimated . 340 Despite this , our analysis revealed extended segments of contact ranging up to 4 μm in length 341 ( median : 1 . 0 µm ) ( Figure 6J ) . Moreover , within each tuft cell , a large percentage ( median : 37 . 8 342 % ) of the core actin bundles are marked as interacting with the microtubules using this approach 343 ( Figure 6K ) . Taken together , these findings reveal that tuft cell giant actin bundles co - align and 344 interdigitate with an array of stable microtubules , forming a cytoskeletal superstructure that 345 extends from the apical surface , down through the sub - apical cytoplasm , to the perinuclear region . 346 347 Membranous organelles associate with cytoskeletal polymers in the tuft 348 The highly ordered , interdigitated network of acetylated microtubules and giant core actin bundles 349 within the sub - apical cytoplasm is uniquely positioned and organized to support motor - driven 350 trafficking of cargoes between the perinuclear region and apical tuft . Consistent with this proposal , 351 TEM revealed numerous small vesicles and membranous organelles in the submicron range 352 tightly associated with giant actin bundles and co - aligned microtubules ( Figure 7A ) . These include 353 both electron lucent vesicles ( green arrow ) as well as potential multivesicular bodies ( MVBs , blue 354 arrow ) . We also observed vesicles that appeared compressed by the surrounding core bundles , 355 implying direct physical association ( see green arrow ) . Interestingly , TEM images showing cross - 356 sections through apical protrusions revealed an abundance of extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) 357 situated between apical protrusions . These EVs were similar in dimensions and appearance to 358 the smaller vesicles noted in the sub - apical cytoplasm ( Figure 7B , cyan ) , suggesting that they 359 12 might be released by tuft cells into the extracellular space . To further examine the possibility that 360 cytoskeletal polymers in the tuft support trafficking of organelles to or from the apical surface , we 361 used light microscopy to examine the distribution of potential membrane protein cargoes . Here 362 we took advantage of mice expressing endogenously tagged cadherin related family member 5 363 ( CDHR5 ) , a single spanning transmembrane protein that resides in apical protrusions , in both 364 enterocytes [ 60 ] and tuft cells . Imaging revealed strong CDHR5 signal at the distal tips of 365 protrusions as expected , and in large vesicles that were closely associated with Ac - tubulin 366 containing microtubules in the sub - apical and perinuclear regions ( Figure 7C ) . These results 367 suggest that the cytoskeletal superstructure supporting the tuft could play a role in delivering or 368 retrieving membranous cargoes to and / or from the apical surface . 369 370 Tuft cells have increased secretory and endocytic pathway markers relative to enterocytes 371 The dense collection of vesicles in the sub - apical cytoplasm and the presence of EVs outside the 372 tuft suggest that tuft cells engage in robust membrane trafficking activities . We therefore stained 373 tuft cells for markers of endo - and exocytosis . Remarkably , tuft cells exhibit robust enrichment of 374 dynamin - 2 beneath the apical surface ( Figure 8A , B ) . Dynamin - 2 drives vesicle scission at the 375 plasma membrane during endocytosis and is also involved in the secretory pathway , promoting 376 the release of vesicles from the Golgi network and the fusion of vesicles at the apical membrane 377 [ 61 ] . We also stained for protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2 ( pacsin - 2 ) , 378 an F - BAR protein involved in apical endocytosis [ 62 ] ; this factor was also markedly increased in 379 tuft cells compared to neighboring enterocytes ( Figure 8C , D ) . Together , these data suggest that 380 tuft cells exhibit elevated trafficking activities and further imply that the tuft plays a fundamental 381 role in transferring materials to and / or from the extracellular space . 382 383 384 DISCUSSION 385 Whereas the physiological roles of canonical apical specializations such as the brush border and 386 hair bundle are well established ( solute uptake and mechanosensation , respectively ) [ 63 , 64 ] , 387 how the apical tuft supports the functions of the tuft cell remains unclear . We reasoned that by 388 developing insight on the architecture of the tuft and its underlying cytoskeleton , we could begin 389 to hypothesize how this structure might be leveraged in vivo to promote tuft cell function and 390 intestinal homeostasis . Previous studies on tuft cells in diverse tissues offered glimpses of the 391 cytoskeletal underpinnings of their unique morphology , although they stopped short of providing 392 13 the specific molecular and structural details needed to understand the cell biological function of 393 the tuft [ 2 , 16 , 17 ] . To fill these gaps , we combined light and electron microscopy to build detailed 394 maps of the cytoskeletal structures and associated binding proteins that comprise the tuft . Below 395 we discuss observations on the organization and composition of these structures , and their 396 implications for understanding the subcellular function of the tuft . 397 398 Organization of protrusions and giant core actin bundles in the tuft 399 Tuft protrusions extend from the apical surface in a cluster with a median packing angle of ~ 59° 400 when viewed en face , indicative of tight , hexagonal packing . For cylindrical objects , a hexagonal 401 arrangement allows the cell to achieve maximum packing density . However , the spread of packing 402 angles observed throughout the tuft was large ( range of 20° - 120° ) revealing flexibility in how giant 403 actin bundles are situated relative to their neighbors . How giant actin bundles are positioned and 404 organized during tuft cell differentiation remains unclear . Enterocyte microvilli exhibit near perfect 405 hexagonal packing , which is enforced by protocadherin - based intermicrovillar adhesion 406 complexes ( IMACs ) that localize to the distal tips of these protrusions [ 60 ] . Interestingly , some 407 IMAC components , such as CDHR5 , are expressed in tuft cells and positioned to serve a similar 408 role ( Figure 7C ) . Whether tuft cells express and localize a full complement of IMAC proteins to 409 control the packing of tuft cell protrusions remains an open question for future studies . However , 410 our dataset does suggest additional mechanisms that might control the organization of tuft 411 protrusions . For example , tight packing could be the result of compressive forces applied by the 412 junctional contractile ring of F - actin and NM2 , which encircles the cluster of giant core actin 413 bundles ( Figure 1N , O ) . This general idea is supported by our quantitative morphometry , which 414 showed that the cross - sectional areas of the cell and the tuft converge right at the transition point 415 where giant actin bundles emerge as protrusions ( Figure 1H ) . Measuring such compressive 416 forces directly is not possible , but high levels of contractility in this belt can be implied from the 417 smaller en face areas and circularity of the apical perimeter . In enterocytes , NM2A and NM2C 418 localize to a similar circumferential belt , but are also found in a medial plane that extends 419 throughout the terminal web [ 31 , 65 ] , a meshwork of actin and intermediate filaments found just 420 below the apical surface . Although previous EM studies were unable to resolve a terminal web 421 meshwork in tuft cells [ 16 ] , we were able to detect both NM2 variants in this plane . This sub - apical 422 population of myosins might also constrain the packing of giant core actin bundles , either through 423 direct binding / crosslinking or by propagating constraining mechanical forces generated by the 424 circumferential belt across the sub - apical region . 425 426 14 Filament organization in giant core actin bundles 427 Previous studies highlighted EPS8 as a barbed - end binding protein that is enriched in discrete 428 puncta at the distal tips of actin - bundle supported protrusions including microvilli , stereocilia and 429 filopodia [ 38 , 40 , 66 ] . Although we only detected low levels of EPS8 at the distal tips of tuft 430 protrusions , a structurally related family member , EPS8L2 , strongly localized to the tips ( Figure 431 3 ) , suggesting that filaments within giant core bundles are uniformly oriented ( i . e . polarized ) in a 432 barbed - end out configuration . The strong distal end enrichment of EPS8L2 is also consistent with 433 a model where individual filaments extend continuously through the full length of the core bundle , 434 although TEM confirmation of this point was complicated by the tilt and curvature of these 435 structures throughout the tuft , which made it difficult to capture their full length in ultra - thin 436 sections . 437 TEM imaging of giant core bundle cross - sections revealed that these structures are 438 composed of ~ 100 hexagonally packed actin filaments . This highly ordered pattern contrasts with 439 the F - actin core found in hair cell stereocilia , which exhibit poorly ordered ‘fluid’ packing , 440 characterized by tight but irregular spacing of filaments [ 67 ] . The hexagonal packing observed in 441 tuft cell giant core bundle might reflect the kinetics or mechanism of bundle polymerization , as 442 highly ordered structures are generally produced through slow growth and low actin bundler 443 concentrations [ 68 ] . The details of filament packing are important as they may ultimately dictate 444 the mechanical flexibility of the bundle in response to lateral forces [ 69 ] . In stereocilia , filaments 445 are crosslinked with multiple structurally distinct actin bundlers ( e . g . fascin - 2 , plastin - 1 , espin - 1 ) 446 and fluid packing is the result of filaments accommodating these different crosslinker lengths [ 67 ] . 447 Indeed , knockout of the most abundant crosslinker in hair cells , plastin - 1 , shifted filament 448 organization from fluid to well - ordered hexagonal packing [ 67 ] . Based on those results , the 449 ordered packing of filaments in giant core actin bundles observed here implies that the activity of 450 single actin crosslinker dominates throughout these structures . 451 452 Regionalization of actin binding proteins along the giant core bundle axis 453 Although our ultrastructural evidence argues in favor of a single crosslinker in giant core actin 454 bundles , our immunofluorescence imaging detected several bundlers in these structures , 455 including advillin , espin , and LIMA1 ( Figure 4 ) . These findings add to the short list of actin binding 456 proteins , including fimbrin and girdin , which have been localized to the tuft by others [ 2 , 21 ] . Our 457 analysis does not allow us to rank order the abundance of the factors we examined . However , 458 these proteins did exhibit an unexpected regionalization along the giant bundle axis , with advillin 459 and espin occupying the membrane - wrapped distal ends , and LIMA1 demonstrating restricted 460 15 localization to the more proximal , rootlet ends . Thus , filament packing patterns could be dictated 461 locally by the specific complement of bundlers present in that segment . Such regionalization 462 would also allow the tuft cell to create segment - specific mechanical properties , which may be 463 important for function . The rootlet localization of LIMA1 is reminiscent of MISP , an actin bundling 464 protein that exhibits specific enrichment on the rootlets of enterocyte microvilli [ 50 ] . Recent studies 465 showed that loss of MISP function in an epithelial cell culture model shortened rootlets , whereas 466 MISP overexpression led to rootlet hyper - elongation , through a mechanism involving competition 467 with membrane - actin linker Ezrin [ 50 ] . Interestingly , previous in vitro studies showed that LIMA1 468 holds actin cross - linking activity , slows F - actin depolymerization , and inhibits binding of the Arp2 / 3 469 complex responsible for branched filament nucleation [ 70 ] . All of these activities are consistent 470 with a role in rootlet elongation . Mechanistic follow - up studies will be needed to define the function 471 of LIMA1 in shaping these unique structures . 472 473 A cytoskeletal superstructure supports the tuft 474 By generating high - resolution 3D image segmentations , we discovered that microtubules and 475 giant core actin bundles interdigitate and exhibit striking co - alignment throughout the sub - apical 476 cytoplasm , with regions of overlap stretching for several microns . Such co - alignment is highly 477 suggestive of specific molecular cross - linking between the two cytoskeletal networks , which could 478 further constrain bundle spreading in the sub - apical compartment ( Figure 1G , H ) . Physical contact 479 between microtubules and actin networks is known to be critical for normal cell function in a range 480 of tissue contexts [ 71 ] . Neuronal growth cones offer a striking example ; in this system , intimate 481 cross - linking between the two cytoskeletons is essential for neurite outgrowth , growth cone 482 motility , and steering [ 72 ] . However , in that case , a central bundle of microtubules connects with 483 a peripheral meshwork of F - actin that is highly branched and extends to the leading edge to drive 484 cell motility . The interdigitated microtubules / actin bundle super - structure revealed here is 485 morphologically unique and likely holds important implications for understanding the physiological 486 function of tuft cells ( more below ) . 487 488 Potential functions for the cytoskeletal superstructure 489 The giant core actin bundles that comprise the tuft extend their rootlets many microns through the 490 sub - apical cytoplasm . Such cytoskeletal architecture is rare in animal cell biology , although it does 491 point to exciting possibilities for potential functions . For example , in any cytoskeletal network , the 492 net orientation of polymers dictates the direction of motor protein driven transport [ 73 ] ; polarized 493 ( i . e . uniform ) filament orientation allows for unidirectional movement of motors , whereas mixed 494 16 filament polarity can lead to motor stalling as demonstrated in vitro for MYO10 [ 74 ] . From this 495 perspective , the parallel and polarized barbed - end out orientation of actin filaments in giant core 496 bundles seem well suited for supporting efficient myosin - driven transport . Although MyTH4 - FERM 497 domain containing myosins are believed to drive transport within the confines of surface 498 protrusions such as filopodia ( MYO10 ) [ 36 ] , microvilli ( MYO7B ) [ 75 , 76 ] , and stereocilia ( MYO7A , 499 MYO15A ) [ 75 , 76 ] , we are not aware of any precedent in the literature for myosin - dependent 500 transport along large parallel actin bundles in open cytoplasm . Investigating this idea in tuft cells 501 would first require identification of candidate myosin motors holding structural and kinetic 502 properties that are compatible with a role in transport ( e . g . a dimeric structure with a processive 503 mechanochemical cycle ) [ 77 ] . Another possibility is that the cytoskeletal superstructure supports 504 directed transport by microtubule motors ( i . e . kinesin family members or dynein ) , which have well 505 established roles in cytoplasmic trafficking [ 78 ] . In this scenario , the long rootlets of giant core 506 bundles might simply serve as a physical scaffold for the alignment of stable microtubules . As 507 some myosins directly interact with kinesins and such interactions increase the movement of both 508 motors along networks containing F - actin and microtubules [ 79 ] , cooperation between these 509 systems might also be possible in the cytoskeletal superstructure that supports the tuft . 510 What cargoes might be transported along the tuft cytoskeleton ? Tuft cells are responsible 511 for the secretion of several effectors including IL - 25 , CysLTs , PGD2 , and Ach , [ 9 - 12 ] which could 512 be potential cargoes . EM and light microscopy analysis also revealed large numbers of vesicles 513 with diverse morphologies distributed along giant core bundle rootlets . In some cases , these were 514 identifiable as MVBs , leading to the possibility that these organelles are trafficked apically , along 515 rootlets , to eventually release of their vesicle cargoes from the cell surface . The abundance of 516 EVs we observed between individual tuft protrusions is consistent with this idea . Live imaging of 517 tuft cells expressing labeled versions of secreted effectors or MVB markers will be needed to 518 determine if the cytoskeletal superstructure in the tuft supports these trafficking functions . 519 520 Next steps 521 Although previous studies uncovered general characteristics of tuft cells , the quantitative 522 morphometry we report here provides a framework for future mechanistic studies of tuft cell 523 function . Additionally , our work provides an experimental blueprint and quantitative point of 524 comparison for eventual characterization of tuft cells in other tissues , as well as neuron - like and 525 immune - like tuft cell subtypes . Tuft cells have been increasingly implicated in intestinal health for 526 parasite clearance as well as restoration of intestinal barrier function in models of Crohn’s disease 527 and ulcerative colitis [ 26 ] . Thus , investigation of how the unique tuft cell cytoskeletal features 528 17 identified here are perturbed in these disease states should be an important goal for future 529 studies . 530 531 532 533 18 METHODS 534 All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript . 535 536 REAGENT OR RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Antibodies anti - EPS8 ( mouse ) [ 1 : 400 ] Sigma - Aldrich Cat # HPA003897 ; RRID : AB _ 1848224 anti - Eps8L2 ( rabbit ) [ 1 : 400 ] Sigma - Aldrich Cat # HPA041143 ; RRID : AB _ 10794985 anti - ZO - 1 ( rat ) [ 1 : 100 ] Milliporesigma Cat # MABT11 ; RRID : AB _ 10616098 anti - NM2A ( rabbit ) [ 1 : 500 ] BioLegend Cat # 909802 ; RRID : AB _ 2734 686 anti - Espin ( rabbit ) [ 1 : 500 ] ThermoFisher Cat # PA5 - 5594 ; RRID : AB _ 2641126 anti - Advillin ( rabbit ) [ 1 : 500 ] ThermoFisher Cat # PA5 - 63621 ; RRID : AB _ 2638403 anti - LIMA1 ( rabbit ) [ 1 : 500 ] Sigma - Aldrich Cat # HPA052645 ; RRID : AB _ 2681898 anti - Myosin 1b ( rabbit ) [ 1 : 500 ] ThermoFisher Cat # PA5 - 63820 ; RRID : AB _ 2644364 19 anti - Ezrin [ 1 : 200 ] Cell Signaling Cat # 3145S ; RRID : AB _ 2100309 anti - Phosphorylate d ezrin ( T567 ) Cell Signaling Cat # 3726S ; RRID : AB _ 10560513 anti - Acetylated tubulin ( mouse ) [ 1 : 800 ] Sigma - Aldrich Cat # T6793 ; RRID : AB _ 477585 anti - Dynein ( mouse ) [ 1 : 50 ] ThermoFisher Cat # MA1 - 070 ; RRID : AB _ 2093668 anti - mCherry ( rat ) [ 1 : 100 ] ThermoFisher Cat # M11217 ; RRID : AB _ 2536611 anti - Pacsin - 2 ( 1 : 200 ) Sigma - Aldrich Cat # HPA049854 ; RRID : AB _ 2680915 anti - Dynamin - 2 ( 1 : 200 ) Sigma - Aldrich Cat # HPA054246 ; RRID : AB _ 2682 427 Goat anti - mouse Alexa Fluor 488 F ( ab’ ) 2 fragment [ 1 : 1000 ] ThermoFisher Cat # A - 11017 ; RRID : AB _ 2534084 Goat anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 F ( ab’ ) 2 ThermoFisher Cat # A - 11070 ; RRID : AB _ 2534114 20 fragment [ 1 : 1000 ] Goat anti - rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 F ( ab’ ) 2 fragment [ 1 : 1000 ] ThermoFisher Cat # A - 21069 ; RRID : AB _ 2535730 Chemicals , peptides , and recombinant proteins Alexa Fluor Plus 405 Phalloidin [ 1 : 200 ] ThermoFisher Cat # A30104 Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin [ 1 : 200 ] ThermoFisher Cat # A22287 Alexa Fluor 568 Phalloidin [ 1 : 200 ] ThermoFisher Cat # A12380 16 % Paraformaldeh yde Electron Microscopy Sciences Cat # 15710 Triton X - 100 Sigma Cat # T8787 ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent Invitrogen Cat # P36930 Lipofectamine 2000 ThermoFisher Cat # 11668019 Antibiotic - antimycotic ( anti - anti ) Gibco Cat # 15240062 Glutaraldehyde 25 % Electron Microscopy Sciences Cat # 16220 Tannic Acid Electron Microscopy Sciences Cat # 21700 21 Osmium Tetroxide Electron Microscopy Sciences Cat # 19112 Cell lines HeLa American Type Culture Collection Cat # CCL2 Mouse models C57BL6 CDHR5 - mCherry mice Developed in house by the Vanderbilt Genome Editing Resource .

Cells were replated onto 35mm 544 glass - bottom dishes or coverslips ( Cellvis # D35 - 20 - 1 . 5 - 23 N ) and incubated in Lipfectamine 545 overnight . Media was replaced the following morning and cells were washed gently in PBS . 546 547 Mouse models 548 Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with Vanderbilt University Medical Center 549 Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines under IACUC Protocols . NM2C - EGFP 550 mouse were obtained as a generous gift from Dr . Robert Adelstein ( NHLBI , NIH ) and were 551 22 described previously [ 31 ] . Mice expressing endogenously tagged CDHR5 mice were created in 552 collaboration with the Vanderbilt Genome Editing Resource . Briefly , CRISPR / Cas9 genome 553 engineering methods were used to insert a flexible linker and mCherry coding sequence at the 3’ 554 end of the CDHR5 terminal coding exon . 555 556 METHOD DETAILS 557 Succinate administration 558 For tissue used in TEM preparation , 120 nM of sodium succinate hexahydrate ( with dextrose at 559 1 % / volume to improve taste ) was added to drinking water of wild - type ( C57BL6 ) mice for one 560 week prior to euthanasia and tissue preparation . 561 562 Frozen and whole mount tissue preparation 563 Segments of proximal intestine were removed , flushed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and 564 prefixed for 15 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) to preserve tissue structure . The tube was 565 then cut along its length , subdissected into 0 . 5 mm – chunks , fixed for an additional 30 min in 4 % 566 PFA at room temperature , and washed three times in PBS . Whole mount samples were then 567 moved to Eppendorf tubes for staining . For frozen sections , tissue samples were gently placed 568 on top of a 30 % sucrose solution in TBS and allowed to sink to the bottom overnight at 4°C . 569 Specimens were then swirled in three separate blocks of OCT ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) , 570 oriented in a block filled with fresh OCT , and snap frozen in dry ice - cooled acetone . Samples were 571 cut into 10 - μm sections and mounted on slides for staining . 572 573 Immunofluorescence 574 Cell culture : For spinning disk confocal imaging , cells were washed three times with pre - 575 warmed phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) before being fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron 576 Microscopy Sciences # 15710 ) in PBS for 15 mins at 37°C . Cells were then incubated for 1 hr with 577 Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin ( 1 : 200 ; Invitrogen # A12380 ) at room temperature . Coverslips were 578 then washed three times in PBS and mounted on slides with 20 μL ProLong Gold ( Invitrogen 579 # P36930 ) . 580 Frozen tissue sections : For Zeiss Airyscan or spinning disk confocal imaging , frozen tissue 581 sections were rinsed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 15 582 mins at room temperature . After permeabilization , tissue slides were rinsed three times in PBS 583 and blocked with 10 % BSA ( Research Products International # 9048 - 46 - 8 ) in PBS for 2 hr at 37°C 584 in a humidified chamber . Immunostaining was performed using primary antibodies ( see table for 585 23 details ) diluted in 1 % BSA overnight at 4°C . After incubation with primary antibody , slides were 586 rinsed three times in PBS and incubated for 2 hr with appropriate secondary antibodies ( see table 587 for details ) and an Alexa Flour conjugated phalloidin ( see table for details ) at room temperature . 588 Slides were then washed three times with PBS and coverslips were mounted with 60 μL ProLong 589 Gold ( Invitrogen # P36930 ) overnight . 590 Wholemount tissue sections : For spinning disc confocal imaging , whole mount tissue was 591 stained in Eppendorf tubes . Tissue was rinsed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % 592 Triton X - 100 in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature on a rocker . After permeabilization , tissue 593 was rinsed three times in PBS and blocked in 5 % BSA overnight at 4°C on a rocker . Primary 594 antibody ( see table for details ) diluted in 1 % BSA was added and left overnight at 4°C on a rocker . 595 The next day , the tissue was washed three times in PBS and the appropriate secondary antibodies 596 ( see table for details ) were diluted in 1 % BSA for 4 hours at room temperature on a rocker . At two 597 hours of incubation , an Alexa Fluor conjugated phalloidin was added to the tissue ( see table for 598 details ) . The tissue was then washed three times in PBS and mounted villi - down on a glass - 599 bottom dish with 20 μL ProLong Gold with a coverslip on top overnight . 600 601 Light microscopy 602 Laser scanning confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon A1 microscope equipped with 603 488 nm , 568 nm , and 647 nm LASERs and a 100x / 1 . 49 NA TIRF oil immersion objective . Spinning 604 disk confocal imaging was conducted using a using a Nikon Ti2 inverted light microscope with a 605 Yokogawa CSU - W1 spinning disk head , a Photometrics Prime95B sCMOS camera , four 606 excitation LASERs ( 488 , 568 , 647 , and 405 nm ) , and a 100X / 1 . 49 NA TIRF oil immersion objective 607 or a 60X / 1 . 49 NA TIRF oil immersion objective . Images presented in figures were deconvolved 608 ( Richardson - Lucy deconvolution of image volumes , 20 iterations ) using Nikon Elements software . 609 Super - resolution images were collected on a Zeiss LSM980 Airyscan microscope with four 610 excitation LASERs ( 488 , 568 , 647 , and 405 nm , ) , and a 63X / 1 . 43 NA oil immersion objective ; 611 images were processed using Zeiss Zen software . 612 613 Electron microscopy 614 To prepare samples for TEM , 1 mm pieces of small intestine were fixed for 1 h in 2 % 615 paraformaldehyde , 2 % glutaraldehyde , in 0 . 1 M cacodylate buffer with 2 mM CaCl 2 . The samples 616 were washed in 0 . 1 M HEPES and slowly equilibrated with 30 % glycerol as a 617 cryoprotectant . Samples were plunge frozen in liquid ethane followed by freeze - substitution in 618 1 . 5 % uranyl acetate in methanol for 48 hours at - 80C . Samples were washed extensively in 619 24 methanol and infiltrated with HM20 Lowicryl . The HM20 was polymerized by UV light at - 30C for 620 24 hours under nitrogen vapor . Samples were sectioned on a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome with a 621 nominal thickness of 70 nm on 200 mesh Ni grids and poststained with uranyl acetate and lead 622 citrate . Images were collected with a Tecnai T - 12 transmission electron microscope operating at 623 100 kV using an AMT nanosprint5 CMOS camera . 624 625 Analysis of scRNAseq data 626 We used a previously published scRNAseq dataset to probe for tuft cell enriched candidate genes 627 [ 26 ] . This dataset was generated using droplet - based single cell sequencing from the small 628 intestine of 6 wild - type mice . Further method details can be found in the original paper . UMAPs 629 were displayed using CellxGene , a single - cell visualization platform . 630 631 Image analysis and statistics 632 All images were processed using Nikon Elements or FIJI software ( https : / / fiji . sc / ) . 633 Actin bundle length and intensity , and localization of actin - binding proteins : Lateral images 634 of frozen sections were analyzed using FIJI . Maximum intensity projections of core actin bundles 635 were generated and lines were drawn from the apical tuft to the bottom of the rootlets to enable 636 measurements of bundle length and marker intensity along the bundle axis . 637 Number , angle , and bundle spreading measurements : Images captured en face using 638 whole mount tissue were used for these quantifications . Maximum intensity projections of image 639 volumes acquired just beneath the apical surface were used to count the number of individual 640 core actin bundles per tuft cell . The core actin bundles were identified by dark spot identification 641 in Nikon Elements and angles were measured from every bundle to two adjacent neighbors . 642 Bundle spreading was measured by calculating bundle area versus cell area ( identified by 643 phalloidin staining ) , using individual slices at the apical surface , 1 . 5 μm , 3 μm , and 4 . 5 μm below 644 the apical surface . 645 Fourier analysis of TEM images : To map filaments of equidistant packing or hexagonal 646 packing back onto an original TEM image , Fourier filtering was performed with DigitalMicrograph 647 and Fiji . Target areas were selected and then filtered using an Fast Fourier Transform . A circular 648 ( for equidistant packing ) or hexagonal mask ( for hexagonal packing ) was placed over the 649 predominant reflections in Fourier space using the masking tools built - in DigitalMicrograph , 650 making the mask as tight as possible to reduce background Fourier signal . After applying the 651 mask , an inverse FFT was performed to generate the corresponding real - space image . This 652 25 image was thresholded in Fiji to remove background signal , pseudocolored , and then merged 653 with the original image . 654 Trainable WEKA segmentation of giant actin bundles and microtubules : Oversampled 655 images of en face whole mount tissues stained with phalloidin and acetylated tubulin were opened 656 in FIJI and subject to Trainable WEKA segmentation [ 29 ] to identify core actin bundles and 657 microtubules independently . Actin probability maps were put under the minimum auto local 658 thresholding while microtubule probability maps were put under the default auto local threshold . 659 These thresholds were chosen to maximize selection of the cytoskeleton . Both maps were 660 opened in Nikon Elements and thresholded so that individual objects ( in this case individual core 661 actin bundles or microtubules ) could be visualized . From this data , we obtained the pitch ( ° ) data . 662 To determine the interaction between microtubules and core actin bundles , we dilated the core 663 actin bundle signals and measured the length of overlap with microtubules . We further compared 664 the volume of the overlap with the volume of the core actin bundles to determine the percent of 665 actin polymer overlapping with microtubules . 666 Intensity analysis of antibody staining : For quantification of NM2C intensities in tuft cells 667 and enterocytes , we used FIJI to analyze en face images from whole mount tissues . Sum intensity 668 projections encompassing the apical surface were generated , an ROI was drawn to capture the 669 tuft cells or a neighboring enterocyte , and the mean intensities were measured . For other intensity 670 measurements , including NM2A , ezrin , phospho - ezrin , dynamin - 2 , pacsin - 2 , and dynein , lateral 671 images of frozen tissue sections were analyzed in FIJI . Sum intensity projections were generated 672 to include the full tuft , an ROI was drawn over apical protrusions , and the mean intensity of the 673 marker was measured using an ROI tool . An identically sized ROI was used to measure the mean 674 intensities from neighboring enterocytes . 675 Nearest neighbor measurements for filaments within individual core actin bundles : FIJI 676 plugin TrackMate was used to mark individual actin filaments within single giant core bundles . 677 The center of each filament was exported as an x , y coordinate , and a custom MATLAB script 678 ( created with generative AI ) was used to identify : ( i ) the number of nearest neighboring filaments 679 within a 12 nm radius of each filament , ( ii ) the distance between nearest neighbors , and ( iii ) the 680 angle between a filament and two adjacent nearest neighbors . 681 682 683 684 26 REFERENCES 685 1 .
