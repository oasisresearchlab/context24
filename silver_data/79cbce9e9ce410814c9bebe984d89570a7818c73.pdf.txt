Dynamic systems perspectives argue that insight arises from self - organizing perceptual and motor processes . Entropy and fractal scaling are potential markers for emerging new and effective solutions . This study investigated whether specific features associated with self - organization in dynamical systems can distinguish between individuals who succeed and those who fail in solving insight tasks . To achieve this , we analyzed pupillary diameter fluctuations of children aged 6 to 12 during the 8 - coin task , a well - established insight task . The participants were divided into two groups : successful ( n = 24 ) and unsuccessful ( n = 43 ) task completion . Entropy , determinism , recurrence ratio , and the β scaling exponent were estimated using Recurrence Quantification and Power Spectrum Density analyses . The results indicated that the solver group exhibited more significant uncertainty and lower predictability in pupillary diameter fluctuations before finding the solution . Recurrence Quantification Analysis revealed changes that went unnoticed by mean and standard deviation measures . However , the β scaling exponent did not differentiate between the two groups . These findings suggest that entropy and determinism in pupillary diameter fluctuations can identify early differences in problem - solving success . Further research is needed to determine the exclusive role of perceptual and motor activity in generating insights and investigate these results’ generalizability to other tasks and populations .

Insights occur when people suddenly discover the only possible solution after unsuccessfully trying to solve a problem while expressing astonishment ( Chronicle et al . , 2004 ; Chu and MacGregor , 2011 ; Weisberg , 2015 ) . So far , theoretical approaches that account for the occurrence of insights propose unconscious or automatic restructuring mechanisms and representations that operate through symbolic or algorithmic systems assembled to reduce error ( Ohlsson , 1992 , 2011 ; Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . According to these approaches , the inadequate representation of a problem creates a space of solutions that cannot solve the task ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . As a result , the repeated unsuccessful attempts create stagnation and the feeling that all possible solutions have been exhausted ( Impasse ; Ohlsson , 1992 ) . One theory that integrates these elements is the Representational Change Theory ( RCT ) , which argues that insight involves the conceptual and perceptual reformulation of the problem . Even when insight tasks may appear to require only a few simple steps for their solution , the real solution can be challenging to discover . According to RCT , incorrect representations of the problem can prevent us from identifying an efficient strategy and executing the correct actions . In order to overcome this difficulty , it is necessary to reorganize the problem representation using two mechanisms : relaxing self - imposed restrictions ( restriction relaxation ) and breaking down the problem into simpler components that are easier to manage perceptually ( chunk decomposition ) . By utilizing both of these mechanisms , the solver can increase the chance of finding the solution to the problem ( Jones , 2003 ; Öllinger et al . , 2013 ) . This process takes place outside of a person’s consciousness , displaying a new space of solutions , and is often accompanied by positive emotions such as pleasure , surprise , and certainty , among others ( Danek et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2016 ) . It is important to note that RCT appeals to the use of symbols and representations and implicitly assumes top - down processes to explain the phenomenon of insight ( for an alternative view , see Satisfactory Progress Theory ; MacGregor et al . , 2001 ; Ormerod et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast , the group of Dixon and collaborators sought to approach insight from a perspective linked to dynamic systems . This view addresses several criticisms raised against the traditional cognitive model , such as the rigidity of the concept of representation and the model’s inability to account for the spontaneous emergence of new strategies or new patterns of response ( Stephen and Dixon , 2009 ) . According to this view , the mechanisms involved in insight are of a perceptual and motor nature . This approach offers an ecological view in which cognition is context - dependent . In that sense , Dixon and collaborators proposed that insight is a self - organizing behavior that emerges from the coupling of perceptual - motor processes during phase transitions ( Dixon and Bangert , 2002 ; Dixon and Dohn , 2003 ; Stephen et al . , 2009 ; Stephen and Dixon , 2009 ; Dixon et al . , 2010 ) . Self - organization refers to the emergence of a new structure or pattern where the components , by themselves , cannot explain what emerges ; and where there is no direction from either a central executive or an external agent ( Ashby , 1962 ; Kelso , 1995 ; van Orden et al . , 2003 ; Smith , 2005 ; Castillo et al . , 2010 ) . Dynamical features related to insight According to Dixon and his colleagues , behavior , and cognition continuously self - organize themselves based on the fluctuations of information and the uncertainty of the environment ( Kugler and Turvey , 1988 ; Bak , 1996 ; Jensen , 1998 ; van Orden et al . , 2003 ; Holden , 2005 ) . This conjecture emerged after they observed two features in the dynamics of behavior linked to self - organizing physical and biological systems : a peak in entropy and a sharp manifestation of 1 / f noise , both just before discovering a new and effective solution . These characteristics indicate the dynamic behavior of some complex systems as they move from one state to another ( Kelso , 1995 ) . 1 / f noise , also known as pink noise , has a power spectrum proportional to the inverse of frequency and is often observed in systems that exhibit long - range correlations or self - similarity ( Holden , 2005 ) . Dixon and Bangert ( 2002 ) reported that the emergence of insights in participants during the Gear System Task experiment was due to self - organizing patterns of behavior that emerged to dissipate entropy . The new strategy was the product of the interaction between the participant’s perceptual - motor system and the environment through force tracing , which introduced entropy . Entropy measures the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a signal . The more uncertain or random the signal is , the higher its entropy will be . Conversely , if the signal is predictable or orderly , its informational entropy will be lower . According to Dixon and collaborators , the cognitive system that is compelled to dissipate such entropy generates a new organization or structure that is more efficient in dissipative work ( van Orden et al . , 2003 ) . The transition from the force - tracing strategy to the alternation strategy was found in preschoolers , schoolers , young people , and adults ( Dixon and Bangert , 2002 ; Dixon and Dohn , 2003 ) . In these groups , the angular velocity of finger movements showed an abrupt increase and decrease in entropy before discovering the alternation strategy through the tracing strategy . Furthermore , the angular velocity adopted the shape of a power - law distribution , which is an asymmetrical distribution that shows the inverse relationship between the frequency of a phenomenon and its magnitude on a logarithmic scale ( Stephen and Dixon , 2009 ) . Dixon conducted other experiments in which uncertainty ( randomness ) was intentionally introduced to the gear - related tasks . As a result , more people could find a solution , and they did so more quickly . In the cases where the task was solved , sudden changes in the entropy of the angular velocity were observed . Furthermore , when analyzing the distribution of eye fixations , the results adopted the form of a power law distribution . Power law distributions are the distribution of objects known as fractals , which themselves are recursive , self - similar patterns at different scales of observation with no mathematical end . In practical terms , fractals reproduce the same variability on different time scales . In other words , they are objects reproduced on more minor scales and where their relative size is inversely related to their frequency ( Brown and Liebovitch , 2010 ) . This type of invariant relation between size and frequency has been detected in various tasks such as time estimations , mental rotation , lexical decision , rhythmical aiming , motor - control tasks , perception of reversible figures , visual search and visual matching , implicit measures of stereotyping , prejudice , self - esteem and physical self - perception reports ( Gilden , 2001 ; Aks and Sprott , 2003 ; Delignières et al . , 2004 ; Correll , 2008 ; Wijnants et al . , 2009 , 2012a ; Diniz et al . , 2011 ; Castillo et al . , 2015 ) . Vásquez - Pinto et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2023 . 1129355 Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin . org While 1 / f - pink noise is ubiquitous in many complex systems , it is not a universal feature of all signals . For example , pupil diameter fluctuations over time cannot behave like 1 / f noise because the pupil does not expand and contract rapidly and sharply under normal conditions . Instead , these fluctuations are better described by Brownian noise , which resembles a random walk process characterized by small and gradual changes in size . There is compelling evidence that this type of signal exhibits Brownian noise instead of 1 / f or pink noise ( Moon et al . , 2014 ; Kim and Yang , 2017 ) . Since these two signals differ radically , the question remains whether , with Brownian noise time series , it is possible to detect significant differences such as those found in the studies mentioned above . In summary , Dixon and colleagues proposed that behavior and cognition self - organize themselves based on the fluctuations of information and the uncertainty of the environment . This self - organizing process involves dissipating entropy to generate a new organization or structure that is more efficient in dissipative work . The emergence of insights is due to self - organizing patterns of behavior that appear to dissipate entropy and is characterized by a peak in entropy and a sharp manifestation of 1 / f noise . These features indicate the dynamic behavior of some complex systems as they move from one state to another and are observed in different cognitive and behavioral tasks . It is important to note that Dixon and his colleagues did not study dilated pupils . In contrast , other researchers who have analyzed fluctuations in pupillary diameter have observed that this signal produces a noise that can be classified as Brownian noise . The gear system task as a pseudo - insight task and the 8 - coins task as an insight task Even though human behavior expresses these two features detected in complex dynamic systems during the resolution of the Gear system task , these results have not been immune to criticism . One important criticism is that the Gear System task lacks the characteristics of a real insight problem ( Chronicle et al . , 2004 ; Chu and MacGregor , 2011 ) . The main difference between insight problems and other types of problems ( e . g . , analytical problems ) is a phase known as an impasse . Although it is a matter of discussion ( Fleck and Weisberg , 2013 ; Danek et al . , 2014 ; Webb et al . , 2016 ) , several models point to the existence of a period of stagnation that precedes the occurrence of an insight ( Wallas , 1926 ; Ohlsson , 1992 ; Öllinger et al . , 2014 ) . Misrepresenting a problem would generate that impasse , usually associated with negative emotions ( Fleck and Weisberg , 2004 ) . The impasse is reflected in a cessation of the resolution activity and by repeating unsuccessful attempts ( Beeftink et al . , 2008 ) . Because of this , solvers think they have tried all the solutions unsuccessfully . After that , a true insight , the only possible solution emerges abruptly due to a mental reorganization of the problem ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Öllinger et al . , 2013 ) . In the Gear System task , no impasse occurs because , from the beginning , participants can solve the problem without significant difficulties , and different strategies might coexist without any mental reorganization . For this reason , the Gear System task is classified as a pseudo - insight task , limiting the applicability of Dixon’s findings to real insight tasks . Given this criticism , in the current study , we explored whether the findings of Dixon and colleagues are generalizable to real insight tasks . More specifically , we asked whether it is possible from entropy fluctuations and fractal scaling to differentiate children who solve an insight problem from those who do not . For this purpose , we used the 8 - coins task , considered a real insight problem task ( Ormerod et al . , 2002 ; Gilhooly et al . , 2010 ; Öllinger et al . , 2013 ) . This task consists of presenting eight black coins , which participants must reorganize with just two moves such that each coin touches three other coins . The solution involves overlapping two key pieces into two separate groups of three pieces each . The 8 - coin task was thoroughly studied by Öllinger et al . ( 2013 ) , who manipulated the presence / absence of certain perceptual cues in the task . For example , in some conditions , the eight coins were located so that all touched each other ( grouped ) or only touched some other ( ungrouped ) . Moreover , other conditions had one coin positioned on top of another ( 3D cue ) or not ( 2D cue ) . These cues affected participants’ performance , showing higher solution rates in ungrouped 3D configurations than in grouped 2D configurations ( Öllinger et al . , 2013 ) . Although the 8 - coin task is a simple problem , the solution can be difficult for individuals . According to the Representational Change Theory ( RCT ) , this would occur because an erroneous representation of the problem would prevent participants from performing 3D movements and thinking about strategies that involve separating the initial group of pieces . Hence , insight would appear as a product of the reorganization of said representation in terms of two mechanisms : restriction relaxation and chunk decomposition ( Öllinger et al . , 2013 ) . The first is the solver’s relaxation of self - imposed restrictions ( e . g . , only performing 2D movements ) . The second would be to decompose the problem into simpler components , more manageable units perceptually ( e . g . , to split the eight - coin group into two four - coin groups ) . The deployment of both mechanisms would allow the participants to find the solution . Pupillary diameter fluctuations as a signal closer to the insight phenomena To study insight in the 8 - coin task , we focused on a physiological signal that may be related to this event . We analyzed the pupillary diameter fluctuations of participants . It is well - known that the pupil constricts or dilates by reflex in response to environmental stimuli . For example , it contracts to luminous stimuli ( Pupillary Light Response or PLR ) , or it constricts to a stimulus presented near fixation ( Pupillary Near Response or PNR ) ( Mathôt , 2018 ) . However , it is less known that the pupil diameter fluctuates according to the Psychosensory Pupil Response ( PPR ) , in which pupil dilation is associated with cognitive activities such as mental effort ( Hess and Polt , 1960 , 1964 ) ; experience of surprise ( Friedman et al . , 1973 ; Preuschoff et al . , 2011 ) , disambiguation of stimuli ( Suzuki et al . , 2018 ) and the change in expectation ( Gilzenrat et al . , 2010 ) ; core components of the insight experience ( Chu and MacGregor , 2011 ) . Moreover , a study demonstrated that increases in pupil diameter were associated with insight achievement , both in the form of “false insight” and “real insight” ( Salvi et al . , 2020 ) . These authors registered the participants’ oculomotor activity while participants solved a battery of problems and discovered that microsaccades were related to resolution through mental analysis . Additionally , they found that increases in pupil diameter were related to problem - solving through insight ( Salvi et al . , 2020 ) . Vásquez - Pinto et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2023 . 1129355 Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin . org Recurrence quantification analysis ( RQA ) and power spectrum density ( PSD ) applied to insight phenomena Based on the analyses conducted by Dixon and colleagues , we utilized two statistical techniques to examine pupil diameter fluctuations : Power Spectrum Density ( PSD ) for estimating power - law scaling ( Hausdorff et al . , 1995 ; Peng et al . , 1995 ; Holden , 2005 ; Kello et al . , 2007 ; Wijnants et al . 2012a , b ) ; and Recurrence Quantification Analysis ( RQA ) for estimating entropy , recurrence ratio , and determinism ( Marwan and Kurths , 2002 ; Shockley , 2005 ; Orsucci et al . , 2006 ; Marwan et al . 2007 ; Bastos and Caiado , 2010 ; Castillo et al . , 2015 ; Ngamga et al . , 2016 ; Lira - Palma et al . , 2018 ; Morales - Bader et al . , 2023 ) . PSD is a method of estimating the power spectrum of a signal from its time - domain representation , which characterizes its frequency content and helps to identify periodicities ( Kello et al . , 2007 ) . This method decomposes the signal into different frequencies using a Fourier transformation . Low - frequency sine waves represent slow changes , high - frequency waves represent fast changes , high - amplitude sine waves represent large changes , and low - amplitude sine waves represent small changes . By plotting the frequency and power of each sine wave on log / log scales , the paired amplitudes and frequencies exhibit a proportional relationship , forming a scaling relation . The slope of the regression line provides a rough estimate of the 1 / f scaling exponent ( Castillo et al . , 2010 ) . By analyzing the slope of the scaling exponent of the power spectral analysis , the Beta ( 𝛃 ) scaling exponents of the simulated time series of White , Pink ( 1 / f ) , and Brownian noise can be estimated ( Figures 1A – C , respectively ) . Panels D , E , and F depict three logarithmic scale plots in which the time series have been submitted to Power Spectral Analysis . The white noise series has a slope of 0 , the pink noise series has a slope of − 1 , and the Brownian noise series has a slope of − 2 . 04 ( 𝛃 ≈ − 2 ) . These results are presented in logarithmic scale plots . RQA is a non - linear , multidimensional statistical analysis used to discover attractors in time series whose signal is irregular , multidimensional , and non - stationary ( Riley and Turvey , 2002 ; Marwan et al . , 2007 ; Wijnants et al . , 2012b ) . RQA has the advantage that from a single time series subjected to a time - delay treatment , it is possible to estimate the value of other variables to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of a system ( Takens , 1981 ) . RQA makes no assumptions about the distribution or size of the data . Measures extracted with RQA are estimated from recurrence plots ( RPs ) , which are graphical representations of a matrix of recurrence that highlights aspects that cannot be detected in the original data set . This matrix is the autocorrelation of the same signal with some delay . Figures 1G – I show three Recurrence Plots ( RPs ) . These plots represent each time series with itself ( on the X and Y axis ) ( Webber and Zbilut , 2005 ) . With this procedure , it is possible to identify points where the series tends to return ( recurrence ) , informing the “preference” of the systems to state in a specific trajectory . Several quantitative and reliable measures can be estimated from RPs , such as the degree of the system’s entropy ( ENT ) , the recurrence ratio ( RR ) , and the proportion of determinism ( DET ) ( Marwan et al . , 2007 ) . ENT estimates the degree of disorder expressed by a system based on the Shannon equation . Mathematically , ENT is the probability distribution of the diagonal line lengths . RR represents the likelihood of a particular state recurring . Finally , DET is related to the system’s predictability ( Stephen and Dixon , 2009 ) . RR is mathematically defined as the density of recurrence points in a plot . DET is calculated as the percentage of recurrence points that form diagonal lines in the recurrence plot with the minimum length . The white noise series ( Figure 1G ) is characterized by a system that moves randomly without any preferred trajectory , resulting in the absence of recurrences . On the other hand , the 1 / f - pink noise ( Figure 1H ) and Brownian noise series ( Figure 1I ) demonstrate a preference for specific trajectories , which can be observed as marked patterns of recurrences . To establish the degree of entropy and other derived measures , the observed pattern in the RP must undergo a series of analyses . However , before implementing these calculations , three parameters must be estimated : the delay , embedded dimensions , and the radius ( Shockley , 2005 ) . For the simulated 2048 - point time series of White , Pink ( 1 / f ) , and Brownian noises , these parameters were 1 , 3 , and 0 . 6 , respectively . The values obtained from the Recurrence Plots ( RPs ) exhibit differences in entropy , recurrence ratio , and determinism . The simulated series of White noise shows the lowest values , pink noise shows intermediate values , and Brownian noise has the highest values . White noise is the most random , with a low preference for a particular trajectory in phase space ( RR ) and a low ability of the initial states to predict future states ( DET ) . On the other extreme , Brownian noise displays a higher level of order or structure , with a marked preference for a particular trajectory in phase space and high levels of predictability due to the semi - periodic nature of the system ( Marwan et al . , 2007 ) . In sum , the present study aimed to test Dixon’s hypotheses on the 8 - coins task , which has a unique correct solution and no alternative strategies . We analyzed participants’ pupillary fluctuations as a physiological signal to study differences between subjects who solved and did not solve the task . Given that visual neurocognitive systems modulate pupillary fluctuations , we hypothesized that children who solved the task would exhibit entropy changes just before finding the solution . This pattern would be absent in those who did not solve the task . Additionally , as previously reported by Dixon and colleagues , successful problem - solvers would exhibit a fractal structure similar to 1 / f - pink noise . However , previous studies on pupillary dilation during cognitive tasks suggest that the temporal structure should be closer to Brownian noise . Therefore , by exploring these different possibilities of temporal structures , we aim to shed light on pupillary fluctuations and their relationship to problem - solving cognitive processes . Method Participants We recruited 76 children between the ages of 6 and 12 ( M = 9 . 39 ; SD = 1 . 53 ) from public schools in Talca City . However , we excluded nine participants from the sample because they solved the task too quickly or withdrew from the study within 120 s of starting the task . Before starting the experiment , we obtained informed consent from the parents or caregivers ( IRB FONDECYT 1161533 ) and provided an informed assent document to the children . The experiment only began once the children explicitly agreed to participate . Our final sample consisted of 67 children ( 36 boys , 31 girls ) randomly assigned to the four experimental conditions ( See Figure 2 ) . No significant Vásquez - Pinto et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2023 . 1129355 Frontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin . org differences in average age across the four conditions were found [ F ( 3 , 63 ) = 0 . 914 , p = 0 . 439 ] . We used G - Power to estimate the required sample size ( Faul et al . , 2007 ) . We employed a 2 × 2 experimental design , which included four groups ( 3D vs . 2D x grouped vs . ungrouped ) . Each group was measured 56 times ( windows ) on their dependent variables , with an effect size of 0 . 30 , an alpha error of 0 . 05 , and a power of 0 . 80 . The total number of participants suggested was 64 ( 16 participants per group ) . Subsequently , we estimated the post - hoc sample size required to compare two groups of children ( non - solvers and solvers ) using an effect size of 0 . 30 , an alpha error of 0 . 05 , a power of 0 . 80 , and 56 measurements of their dependent variables . The estimated sample revealed that we needed 20 children ( 10 per group ) to achieve the desired statistical power . Materials and methods We used the 8 - coin task as an insight task ( Öllinger et al . , 2013 ) . This task contained eight circular pieces ( or “coins” ) of 40 mm in diameter and 2 mm high . These were placed on a 7 cm x 31 cm x 31 cm ( “ABITARE , LIGHTING , ” 220v ) platform . The surface was divided into 36 cells of 4 cm2 each ( Figure 2B ) . One of four possible 8 - coin configurations was presented ( Figure 2 , Panels C to F ) with approximately 10 degrees of inclination relative to the participant . These four configurations resulted from combining two factors with two levels each ( grouping and dimensionality ) . Grouping refers to configurations where the eight coins could be grouped in one big segment ( Panel C and D ) or separated into subsets ( Panel E and F ) . Dimensionality refers to configurations that could present a 3D cue ( coin overlapping other ; Panel D and F ) or where this cue is absent ( Panel C and E ) . These factors combined formed four conditions : Grouped - 2D , Ungrouped - 3D , Grouped - 3D , and Ungrouped - 3D . An eye - tracking system was used to record eye activity ( Tobii Eye Tracker X2 - 60 ; Figure 2A ) . This system consists of glasses that record eye movements ( i . e . , fixations , attention , and pupil behavior ) and a tablet that receives and records this information in real - time . From each child’s task recording , a video of his / her eye movements was obtained by the Tobii Studio software . FIGURE 1 Time - series simulation of white noise ( A ) , pink noise ( B ) , and Brownian noise ( C ) with 2048 samples .

Recurrence Plot of the Recurrence Quantification Analysis ( RQA ) for white noise ( G ) , pink noise ( H ) , and Brownian noise ( I ) . For the RQA , a delay of 1 , embedding dimensions of 3 , and a threshold of 0 . 6 were used . Vásquez - Pinto et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2023 . 1129355 Frontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin . org Procedure Each participant was evaluated in an isolated laboratory room with two experimenters ( E1 and E2 ) . E1 ( located next to the child ) was in charge of positioning the eye - tracking glasses , giving instructions , rearranging the pieces whenever an attempt was unsuccessful , and providing feedback ( i . e . , briefly explaining why the attempt did not accomplish the solution ) . E2 ( located behind the child ) was responsible for recording a video with the information captured by the eye - tracking glasses and monitoring that each child was looking at the board when solving the task . Once the eye - tracking glasses were calibrated , the experiment began with E2 starting the recording and E1 reading the following instruction : “In this task , there are 8 circular coins . Please , count them : one , two , three… and eight coins . As you can see , all coins are identical . Your task is to move only two coins so that each coin touches the other three coins . Note how they are distributed on the platform ; some touch two other coins , some touch three , and so on . You can move any coin you want . Remember that your task is to move only two coins , so each coin touches another three coins . You must move the coins whenever you have a solution in mind . Remember FIGURE 2 ( A ) Sketched picture of a participant using eye - tracking glasses ( Tobii Eye Tracker X2 - 60 ) during the insight problem - solving task . ( B ) Picture of the grouped coins with 2D cues distributed on the platform . ( C ) At right , configuration with grouped coins and 2D cue . ( D ) Configuration with grouped coins and 3D cue .

In all four configurations , at the right , the arrows indicate the coins that must be moved and where they must be placed to solve the task successfully . Vásquez - Pinto et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2023 . 1129355 Frontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin . org that you can move two coins per attempt . You must inform the experimenter when you think you have found the solution” . After each unsuccessful attempt , participants were instructed to avert their gaze from the platform and look in a different direction . At this moment , E1 resets the coins to their initial configuration and begins the next attempt . This procedure was repeated until the task was solved , or until a minimum of 20 min had passed ( after which participants had the option to discontinue ) , or a maximum of 40 min . If the children had not found the solution after 20 min , once they had completed the attempt , they were asked if they wanted to continue . If they decided to continue , the task continued for 20 more minutes . The time range of 20 to 40 min was established based on a pilot sample in which coins of various sizes and materials ( metal , wood , and poker chips ) were tested on different surfaces . While this time frame was initially determined preliminarily , it was consistently applied to all children in the study . It should be noted that there were no instances of children voluntarily giving up before the 20 - min mark , nor were there any cases of children wanting to continue beyond the 40 - min limit if they had not yet solved the problem . Regardless of the result , each child received a didactic toy as a reward for their participation . Data processing Pupil diameter fluctuations were extracted from the eye with the most information from each participant . A Hampel Filter was applied to remove atypical data ( records with pupil diameters ±3 SD ) . Then some data lost due to blinking or loss of eye tracking were interpolated with the Akima interpolation method , as one of the suggestions of Dan et al . ( 2020 ) for this type of data . When the window of missing values was equal to or less than 2 s ( 100 data points ) , an interpolation was performed ; otherwise , those missing values were assumed missing and deleted . Finally , the data were normalized using a MinMax normalization between 0 and 1 to compare subjects with different pupil sizes on the same scale . Figure 3 shows the data preprocessing at each step . Data analysis RQA and PSD analyses A windowed recurrence quantification analysis ( RQA ) was performed . Each window comprised 500 data points , corresponding to approximately 100 s of the task . The windows were moved in steps of 100 data points in each step . For example , the first window went from 0 to 500 data points , the second from 100 to 600 , and so on . Since subjects took different times to finish the task or give up , to analyze equivalent time instants and compare the same moments between subjects , we took the last 120 s of each subject . These last 120 s are equivalent to the last 56 windows of the RQA . The Python library PyRQA ( Rawald et al . , 2017 ) was used to perform the RQA . The RQA has three main parameters to be estimated . The first is the lag , estimated with the average mutual information ( AMI ) technique , selecting the lag where the function decays to 1 / e of its value at zero . Since we are working with windows of 500 data points and steps of 100 data points , the lag was estimated for the same windows and all subjects . A lag of 6 was chosen , corresponding to the mode of the lag of all windows for all subjects . The second parameter is the embedded dimensions , which depend on the lag . The false nearest neighbor’s method was used to estimate this parameter . For the selected lag or delay ( d = 6 ) , embedded dimensions of 6 were chosen , corresponding to the mode of the smallest fraction of false neighbors in each window among all subjects . The AMI method is implemented in the R library NonlinearTseries ( Garcia and Sawitzki , 2015 ) , whereas the false nearest neighbor’s method is implemented in the R library tseriesChaos ( Fabio Di Narzo , 2019 ) . Finally , we estimate the threshold , which defines the minimum threshold for two points considered close or recurrent in the phase space . A general guideline is to select a value that allows the recurrence percentage to be low but not so low as to produce a floor effect ( Pellecchia and Shockley , 2005 ; Webber and Zbilut , 2005 ) . For this , we analyzed different values until we obtained an average recurrence percentage between all windows and subjects that fell around 10 % . Our chosen threshold value was 0 . 02 . As for other parameters , the minimum number of points considered as a diagonal or vertical line was 25 . Because pupil diameter fluctuations do not usually vary so much in such a short time , this minimum length was chosen to avoid a ceiling effect in the determinism measure or a floor effect in the entropy measure . From the RQA , we selected three measures to be analyzed between the two groups : recurrence ratio , determinism , and entropy . The recurrence ratio indicates the probability that a specific state will recur . It corresponds to the density of points on a recurrence plot . We expect to see similar recurrences among participants since it was one of the calibration measures for the threshold parameter . However , differences between groups may occur if they suddenly become more or less recurrent for a significant period . Determinism is , in some cases , related to the predictability of the system . It is the percentage of points that form a diagonal line on a recurrence plot . Differences between groups would indicate differences in the variability and predictability of fluctuations . Entropy ( Shannon entropy ) is related to the complexity of the deterministic structure of the system . It corresponds to the probability that a diagonal line of the recurrence plot has precisely its length . It is a measure related to determinism but gives us more details about the complexity of the variability of the data . For a more detailed description , the interested reader can review the appendix , which contains a mathematical description of the RQA and its measures mentioned here ( Supplementary Appendix A ) . To evaluate the temporal structure of the pupil diameter fluctuations ( i . e . , whether it is closer to Brownian or 1 / f pink noise ) , we performed a Power Spectral Density ( PSD ) using Welch’s method with a sampling frequency of 50hz . This analysis was performed for all subjects in the same windows used in the RQA ( 500 data points and steps of 100 ) . For pink noise , if plotted on a log – log scale , the logarithmic power function follows a straight line with slope − 1 . In contrast , the Brown noise is a line with a slope of − 2 . White noise has a slope of 0 ( Stadnitski , 2012 ) . Thus , the slope of the spectral power was estimated in a log – log scale for each subject and each window . A brief mathematical description of the PSD and the Welch method is described in the appendix ( Supplementary Appendix A ) . In addition , to explore whether it is possible to detect differences with traditional measures of central tendency , we calculated the group average in each window and the average of the standard deviation of each group and window . Vásquez - Pinto et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2023 . 1129355 Frontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin . org For each measure mentioned ( recurrence ratio , determinism , entropy , spectral power density estimate , average per window , and standard deviation per window ) , a two - way mixed ANOVA was performed , with the measure as the dependent variable , solving and the non - solving group as the between - subjects and the windows as the within - subjects . Post - hoc tests were performed , if appropriate , with the Bonferroni test . Performance analysis One of our study’s primary aims was to replicate prior investigations’ findings using our adapted version of the 8 - coin task . This task enabled us to be in line with insight theories . The separate presentation of coins facilitates chunk decomposition , which is impeded when coins are presented together . Additionally , presenting 3D cues , where one coin is placed on top of another and slightly misaligned , promotes constraint relaxation . When coin configurations are presented separately and with 3D cues , it enhances the probability of finding the correct solution . Therefore , our 2 - by - 2 design should impact the proportion of correct responses , time to complete the task , and the number of attempts made by participants . Regarding performance , three dependent variables were selected : the task result ( the participant solved or did not solve the problem ) , the total time spent completing the task ( in seconds ) , and the number of attempts before desisting or solving the problem . These variables were analyzed by a 2 - by - 2 factorial ANCOVA , in which grouping ( grouped versus ungrouped ) and dimensionality ( presence of a 3D cue versus only 2D cue ) were the between - subjects factors . The children’s age was selected as a covariate . Results Performance The results showed that ungrouped coins led to a higher proportion of correct responses ( M = 0 . 515 ) compared to grouped coins ( M = 0 . 224 ) , [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 8 . 345 , p = 0 . 005 , η p2 = 0 . 12 ] . Similarly , the use of 3D cues resulted in a higher proportion of correct responses ( M = 0 . 476 ) compared to 2D cues ( M = 0 . 263 ) , [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 4 . 59 , p = 0 . 036 , η p2 = 0 . 07 ] . However , no interaction effect was observed between grouping and dimensionality [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 1 . 579 ; p = 0 . 214 ] . The analysis also revealed that children took less time to solve the problem with ungrouped coins ( M = 715 . 87 s ) compared to grouped coins ( M = 1132 . 15 s ) , [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 14 . 175 , p = 0 . 0001 , η p2 = 0 . 192 ] . There were no significant effects of dimensionality [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 2 . 834 ; p = 0 . 10 ] or grouping - dimensionality interaction [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 1 . 5831 ; p = 0 . 213 ] on solution time . The number of attempts was not significantly affected by grouping [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 2 . 54 , p = 0 . 116 ] , dimensionality [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 0 . 685 , p = 0 . 411 ] , or dimensionality - grouping interaction [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 0 . 348 , p = 0 . 558 ] . The results showed significant associations between age and three variables : proportion of correct responses [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 14 . 487 , p = 0 . 000 , η p2 = 0 . 189 ] , solution time [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 4 . 086 , p = 0 . 048 , η p2 = 0 . 062 ] , and number of attempts [ F ( 1 , 62 ) = 4 . 536 , p = 0 . 037 , η p2 = 0 . 068 ] .

Figure 4 displays the estimated means while controlling for the effect of age . In sum , even after controlling for age statistically , grouping and dimensionality had independent effects on finding the correct solution and the solution time . Specifically , the proportion of correct responses increased , and solving times decreased when the coins were ungrouped or when 3D cues were utilized . However , no interaction effect was observed between clustering and dimensionality . Our results provide evidence that our adapted version of the 8 - coins task produces results consistent with previous research . Specifically , our findings support the positive impact of using 3D cues and ungrouping the coins on task performance , which were observed not only in the proportion of correct responses but also in the time taken to complete the task and the number of attempts made . Pupil diameter fluctuations Two groups of children were formed depending on who solved the task . Forty - three children did not solve the task ( 64 . 2 % ) and spent an average of 20 min and 24 s ( SD = ±5 min approximately ) trying to find the solution until they gave up . In contrast , 24 children solved the task ( 35 . 8 % ) , spending an average of 6 min and 22 s ( SD = ±5 min approximately ) to find the solution . We calculated four measures , Entropy ( ENT ) , recurrence ratio ( RR ) , determinism ( DET ) , and Beta scaling exponent ( β ) , for each participant in the last 56 windows , each lasting around 10 s , with an 8 - s overlap with the next window . A mixed ANCOVA was used to analyze the data , with the group solvers versus no - solvers being the between - subjects factor and the 56 windows being the within - subjects factor . The model included children’s age as a covariate ( refer to Figure 5 ) . Regarding ENT ( Figure 5 , Panel A ) , the solver group had a lower average than the non - solver group [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 10 . 271 ; p = 0 . 002 ; η p2 = 0 . 138 ] . There was also a significant group - windows interaction effect [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 2 . 960 ; p = 0 . 0000 ; η p2 = 0 . 044 ] , indicating that children who solved the problem had lower ENT than those who did not , specifically in 24 windows , from 47 to 39 and from 25 to 11 . The analysis did not reveal any effect of children’s age on ENT [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 1 . 068 ; p = 0 . 305 ] or windows [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 1 . 064 ; p = 0 . 349 ] or any significant windows - age interaction [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 1 . 135 , p = 0 . 232 ] . These findings suggest that the amount of uncertainty or randomness in the physiological signal , pupil diameter , increases in the solver group before children find the solution . In terms of DET ( Figure 5 , Panel C ) , only a significant group - windows interaction effect was detected [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 1 . 959 ; p = 0 . 000 ; η p2 = 0 . 030 ] , indicating that the solver group had lower DET than the not - solver group in 5 windows , from window 22 to 18 . The analysis also revealed that children’s age was associated with DET [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 5 . 27 , p = 0 . 025 ] . However , the analysis did not find any significant effects of groups [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 1 . 031 , p = 0 . 314 ] , windows [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 0 . 701 , p = 0 . 954 ] , or windows - age interaction [ F ( 55 , 53 , 520 ) = 0 . 716 , p = 0 . 943 ] . In terms of RR ( Figure 5 , Panel E ) , the solver group had a lower average than the non - solver group [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 4 . 227 ; p = 0 . 044 ; η p2 = 0 . 062 ] . There were no differences among windows [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 0 . 619 , p = 0 . 988 ] , and no significant windows - groups or windows - age interaction effects [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 1 . 201 , p = 0 . 148 and F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 0 . 588 , p = 0 . 993 , respectively ] . Children’s age had no significant effect on RR [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 1 . 219 , p = 0 . 274 ] . In Figure 5 , Panel B , we examined the β scaling exponent and found that there were no significant effects related to children’s age [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 3 . 280 ; p = 0 . 075 ] , group [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 0 . 29 , p = 0 . 592 ] , windows [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 0 . 709 , p = 0 . 949 ] , windows - group interaction [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 1 . 148 , p = 0 . 213 ] , or windows - age interaction [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 0 . 756 , p = 0 . 908 ] . Furthermore , it is worth noting that the beta FIGURE 4 Mean and standard error of task - solving ratio ( A ) , duration or time to complete the task in seconds ( B ) , and the number of attempts ( C ) for each coin grouping condition and each coin dimensionality condition . The age of the participants was controlled as a covariate . Although no significant interaction effects were observed , a subsequent analysis of simple effects , employing the Bonferroni test , revealed that when examining grouped coins , the solving rate was lower , and the duration was longer for 2D cue configurations compared to 3D cues configurations . The asterisk indicates significant differences . Vásquez - Pinto et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2023 . 1129355 Frontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin . org values observed in each window fell within a range of − 1 . 7 to − 2 . 0 , close to the range associated with Brownian noise . We also investigated whether nonlinear analysis can detect changes that traditional measures , such as the mean and standard deviation , are unable to detect . In Figure 5 , Panels D and F , we analyzed the mean average and the average standard deviation of pupil diameter , respectively . For the mean average ( Figure 5 , Panel F ) , we found no interaction effect [ Fs ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) ≤ 1 . 215 ; ps ≥ 0 . 135 ] , and there were no significant differences among windows [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 0 . 622 , p = 0 . 987 ] or between groups [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 0 . 008 , p = 0 . 931 ] . The children’s age , as a covariate , had no effect [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 0 . 129 , p = 0 . 720 ] . Regarding the average standard deviation of pupil diameter , we found that the solver group had a higher average than the non - solver group [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 26 . 104 ; p = 0 . 000 ; η p2 = 0 . 290 ] . However , no interaction effects were observed [ Fs ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) ≤ 1 . 224 ; ps ≥ 0 . 125 ] , and there were no significant differences among windows [ F ( 55 , 3 , 520 ) = 0 . 686 , p = 0 . 963 ] . The children’s age , as a covariate , had no effect [ F ( 1 , 64 ) = 1 . 038 , p = 0 . 312 ] . The findings suggest that the children who successfully solved the problem displayed higher entropy in their pupillary diameter fluctuations than those who did not . This difference was observed between 92 and 20 s before the end . The determinism also detected group differences between 86 and 76 s before the end . Conversely , RR , β scaling exponent , average standard deviation , and average mean of pupil diameter fluctuations did not differentiate the groups at any time . In summary , the study analyzed the pupillary diameter fluctuations of children solving an insight problem - solving task . It divided them into two groups : children who solved the task ( solver group ) and those who did not ( non - solver group ) . The analysis was focused on four nonlinear dynamics measures : Entropy ( ENT ) , recurrence ratio ( RR ) , determinism ( DET ) , and β scaling exponent . The study found that seconds before finding the solution , the solver group had a lower average of ENT and DET than the non - solver group . These results indicate that the solver group had more uncertainty and less predictability than the non - solver group . The results suggest that RQA measures can detect changes that means and standard deviations fail to detect . Finally , two findings are noteworthy regarding the β scaling exponent . Firstly , it failed to detect any significant differences between the solver group and the non - solvers FIGURE 5 Comparisons of the last 120 s of those who did and did not solve the task on different metrics .

Secondly , the values of the said exponent were closer to Brownian noise than to 1 / f pink noise . Discussion The main goal of our study was to test if pupillary diameter fluctuations could distinguish between children who successfully solved the adapted 8 - coins insight task and those who did not , using analyses associated with dynamical systems . Our key finding was that before solving the task , the pupils of the children who successfully solved the problem showed significant differences . In terms of entropy , such differences appeared between 102 and 86 s , and in between 58 and 30 s . In terms of determinism these differences were seen between 52 and 44 s compared to the unsuccessful group . After this period , pupil fluctuations between the two groups became similar again . Moreover , the recurrence ratio measure revealed that the pupillary diameter fluctuations of children who successfully solved the task had a lower probability of recurrence during all the measure trajectory than those who did not solve the task . In contrast , the beta exponent of the PSD did not show any differences between the two groups . Additionally , the estimated exponents for each of the 56 windows indicated that the values fluctuated within the range of what is known as Brownian Noise . It is worth noting that when comparing both groups using conventional statistics ( mean and standard deviation ) , we did not find apparent differences as we did with RQA measures ( DET and ENT ) . During the 8 - coin task , each trial involves the child observing and manipulating coins on a surface to find the correct solution . These action - perception chains initially fail and introduce uncertainty into the system , which cannot be dissipated using the system’s existing structures . Consequently , the system is compelled to reorganize itself and find a new structure that can handle the uncertainty more efficiently . From this perspective , solving an insight problem reflects the emergence of a new structure capable of managing a high degree of uncertainty . Our results support this view , as the pupil diameter fluctuations associated with cognitive functioning , as suggested by Hess and Polt ( 1960 , 1964 ) and Mathôt ( 2018 ) , were linked to changes in entropy . However , the most important finding occurs between seconds 58 and 30 ( Windows 25 and 11 ) , where an entropy peak was appreciable in the group that solved the problem . During that time segment , the pupil of this group exhibited greater randomness , which was accompanied by less predictability in the measure put forward by Dixon and Bangert ( 2002 ) , Dixon and Dohn ( 2003 ) , Stephen et al . ( 2009 ) , Stephen and Dixon ( 2009 ) , and Dixon et al . ( 2010 ) . They proposed that changes in entropy are related to self - organization within the system and reflect a transition from one state to another ( Kugler and Turvey , 1988 ) . In the case of insight , the self - organization of a new cognitive structure leads to its emergence . External factors can introduce instability into a system , causing an increase in entropy . As entropy increases , the interaction between perceptual and motor mechanisms promotes adopting a new state that can cope with instability and uncertainty and restore order ( Bak , 1996 ; Jensen , 1998 ) . Thus , the emergence of insight depends on the continuous interaction of various motor and perceptual components with contextual elements and aspects of the 8 - coin task . A new pattern or structure emerges at a certain level of disorder , making it possible to solve the task . Regarding the PSD per window , the Beta scaling exponent ( β ) of the solvers and the non - solvers groups did not differ throughout the windows . In fact , β scaling exponent of both groups moved systematically in the Brownian noise spectrum , far from 1 / f pink noise ( Gilden et al . , 1995 ) . This kind of noise has been previously discovered in pupil diameter fluctuations ( Moon et al . , 2014 ; Kim and Yang , 2017 ) . Even when 1 / f pink noise has been detected in different types of tasks such as visual attention ( Kello et al . , 2007 ) , time estimation ( Gilden et al . , 1995 ; Holden , 2005 ) , rhythmical aiming ( Wijnants et al . , 2012a , b ) , automatic response ( Gilden , 1997 ; Beltz and Kello , 2006 ) , mental rotation ( Gilden , 2001 ) and problem - solving ( Dixon et al . , 2010 ) , the interpretation of such noise remains under discussion . Some researchers have argued that fractal patterns close to 1 / f - noise in behavioral and physiological responses show that the boundaries of the system become less rigid , allowing various processes to operate at different timescales to exhibit similar patterns of variability for a period of time and eventually giving rise to the formation of a new , organized structure ( Bak , 1996 ; Jensen , 1998 ; for an alternative interpretation , see Wagenmakers et al . , 2004 , 2005 ; Bogartz and Staub , 2012 ) . After examining the results , a question that arises is why only entropy and determinism allowed us to find differences between groups . Fractal exponents are influenced by the interplay between internal and external constraints in a task ( van Orden et al . , 2003 ; Likens et al . , 2015 ) . Dixon et al . proposed that the appearance of 1 / f noise is linked to agent - environment dynamics ( Bak , 1996 ; Chemero , 2009 ) . These fractal patterns would reflect the healthy functioning of organisms ( Hausdorff et al . , 1995 ; Goldberger et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , the fact that both groups exhibited β exponents close to Brownian noise could indicate a short - term coordinated activity between motor and perceptual processes rather than a long - range correlation . Moreover , it could be argued that pupillary diameter fluctuations have a less flexible functioning compared to other variables , such as angular velocity , in which individuals can demonstrate greater flexibility and dexterity as the task is practiced repeatedly . This study showed that the pupil diameter fluctuations of both groups exhibited Brownian noise , and noticeable fluctuations of entropy and determinism were observed in the successful group . The reason for this discrepancy remains unclear , and it is possible that the 8 - coin task induced a different type of variability in pupil diameter fluctuations , which may reflect the unique cognitive demands of this task . It is worth mentioning that conventional statistics ( average and standard deviation ) failed to detect significant differences between groups at specific windows . Therefore , the advantages of Recurrence Quantification Analysis ( RQA ) in these cases are evident ( Marwan and Kurths , 2002 ; Shockley , 2005 ; Orsucci et al . , 2006 ; Marwan et al . , 2007 ; Bastos and Caiado , 2010 ; Ngamga et al . , 2016 ) . RQA is a powerful tool to identify complexity and temporal structure patterns in time series data , particularly when the underlying dynamics are poorly understood or when traditional statistical methods are not sensitive enough to detect subtle differences . In this sense , our study adds to the growing body of literature highlighting the value of RQA as a complementary approach to conventional statistics in analyzing complex time series data . Overall , our findings partially support the direction proposed by Dixon and colleagues , suggesting that human beings ( in this case , Vásquez - Pinto et al . 10 . 3389 / fpsyg . 2023 . 1129355 Frontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin . org children ) may experience the self - organization of a novel and effective response pattern during the resolution of insight tasks . Specifically , our results indicate that participants who successfully solved the task exhibited distinct patterns of entropy and determinism in their pupil diameter fluctuations before finding the solution , consistent with the behavior expected from self - organizing systems . However , it remains to be determined whether beta scalar exponents can reliably distinguish individuals who successfully solve the task from those who do not . Furthermore , it is unclear whether fractality is a characteristic that applies equally to all participants when solving insight tasks , or if it may vary depending on the specific nature of the problem . These questions warrant further investigation in future studies .
