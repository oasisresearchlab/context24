MaxQuant enables high peptide identiﬁcation rates , individualized p . p . b . - range mass accuracies and proteome - wide protein quantiﬁcation Ju ¨ rgen Cox & Matthias Mann Efﬁcient analysis of very large amounts of raw data for peptide identiﬁcation and protein quantiﬁcation is a principal challenge in mass spectrometry ( MS ) - based proteomics . Here we describe MaxQuant , an integrated suite of algorithms speciﬁcally developed for high - resolution , quantitative MS data . Using correlation analysis and graph theory , MaxQuant detects peaks , isotope clusters and stable amino acid isotope – labeled ( SILAC ) peptide pairs as three - dimensional objects in m / z , elution time and signal intensity space . By integrating multiple mass measurements and correcting for linear and nonlinear mass offsets , we achieve mass accuracy in the p . p . b . range , a sixfold increase over standard techniques . We increase the proportion of identiﬁed fragmentation spectra to 73 % for SILAC peptide pairs via unambiguous assignment of isotope and missed - cleavage state and individual mass precision . MaxQuant automatically quantiﬁes several hundred thousand peptides per SILAC - proteome experiment and allows statistically robust identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of 4 4 , 000 proteins in mammalian cell lysates . Data analysis in MS - based proteomics is much more challenging than for other high - throughput technologies such as microarrays 1 and remains a principal bottleneck in proteomics 2 , 3 . In one popular format of MS - based proteomics , proteins are enzymatically digested to peptides , which are analyzed online by liquid chromatography ( LC ) coupled to electrospray and tandem MS ( MS / MS ) 4 . MS spectra contain peptide mass and intensity information , and the identity of the peptides is deduced by matching the MS / MS spectra against a sequence database 5 , 6 . Typically , peaks are extracted from raw data , the peptide mass is estimated from the scan from which the peak was ‘picked’ for sequencing and the peak ﬁles are sent to a search engine . Results consist of tables of identiﬁed proteins . In a quantitative proteomics experiment using stable isotopes , peptide and protein ratios are obtained by direct comparison of the signals of the ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ isotope in the same LC run 7 , 8 . There is already a substantial literature on ‘computational proteo - mics’ ( reviewed in refs . 3 , 9 – 12 ) . However , these efforts were usually not directed at high - resolution data of the type readily attainable today and they do not approach the quality of a skilled human expert . Here we describe a set of algorithms that efﬁciently and robustly extracts information from raw MS data and allows very high peptide identiﬁcation rates as well as high - accuracy protein quantiﬁcation for several thousand proteins in complex proteomes . RESULTSAnalysispipeline MaxQuant incorporates all steps needed in a computational proteo - mics platform but currently uses Mascot 13 to generate peptide candidates for MS / MS spectra . Below , we describe the analysis frame - work and illustrate its performance with SILAC - treated HeLa cells that were stimulated for 2 h with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) 14 . These data were obtained by triplicate analysis of 24 peptide fractions from isoelectric focusing using an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer . We describe conceptual issues and computational analysis . A detailed explanation of algorithms is provided in Supplementary Notes online and their C # source code in Supplementary Data online . Feature detection and quantiﬁcation The high resolution of modern mass spectrometers and the need for quantiﬁcation in functional proteomics led us to start the data analysis with ‘features’ in the MS spectra ( mass and intensity of the peptide peaks ) rather than focus on the fragmentation spectra . This is already commonly done in MS - based biomarker discovery 9 . In MaxQuant , peaks are detected in each MS scan by ﬁtting a gaussian peak shape to the three central raw data points and then assembled into three - dimensional ( 3D ) peak hills over the m / z - retention time plane ( Fig . 1a – c ) . Smoothed intensity proﬁles over retention time are split at signiﬁcant local minima . From the centroid masses we obtain a high precision , intensity - weighted estimate of mass for the 3D peak ( Fig . 1d ) . For each 3D peak an individual mass precision is calculated by bootstrap replication ( Supplementary Notes ) . Each of the 72 LC - MS runs of the HeLa proteome resulted in B 382 , 000 3D peaks , on average . It is not trivial to efﬁciently and reliably determine isotope patterns , and we employ a graph theoretical data structure to construct an undirected graph with the 3D peaks as vertices .

The resulting graph contains millions of edges , connecting ‘pre - isotope’ patterns , which , however , are not necessarily consistent in terms of charge state . We then iteratively determine the longest , consistent sub - graphs . In the LC - MS run in Figure 2 , the number of 3D peaks was 317 , 658 , assembling into 31 , 806 isotope patterns . Thus , isotope patterns reduce data features tenfold and are a potent noise ﬁlter . A particularly dense region is greatly enlarged in Figure 2c . In this small region of a few m / z units , three overlapping isotope patterns are automatically and correctly assigned , despite the overlap caused by peptides of different charge states ( z ¼ 5 versus z ¼ 2 ) and near - identical masses of two co - eluting peptides . This would have been difﬁcult from the MS information alone , even for an expert human scientist ( Fig . 2d ) . In our example we carried out SILAC 16 using arginine and lysine . To detect heavy - light SILAC partners we consider all possible pairs of isotope patterns . Potential SILAC pairs are ﬁrst required to have sufﬁcient intensity correlation over elution time ( allowing for some retention - time shift due to isotope effects ) and to have equal charges . By default we assume at most three labeled amino acids per peptide . Therefore , pairs could contain lysine ( K ) , arginine ( R ) , KK , KR , RR , KKK , KKR , KRR and RRR .

If the mass differences are within the combined bootstrap error and if there is sufﬁcient intensity correlation of the two isotope patterns in m / z dimension , the peaks are associated as a SILAC pair . Figure 2 contains 5 , 666 SILAC pairs . The resulting isotope patterns are then scaled to each other using all ratios , starting with a least - square solution and determining the best median ﬁt iteratively by bisection . This yields the fold - change between the two SILAC peptides ( Supplementary Notes ) . For triple - labeling SILAC experiments 17 more cases need to be considered but the procedures are very similar . In each LC - MS run , we normalize peptide ratios so that the median of their logarithms is zero , which corrects for unequal protein loading , assuming that the majority of proteins show no differential regulation . Improving peptide mass accuracy The peptide mass is calculated as the intensity - weighted average of all MS peak centroids in the 3D peaks within the isotope patterns belonging to a SILAC pair or triplet . The statistics of the number of mass measurements per SILAC peptide is given in Supplementary Figure 1 online . We use the several hundred SILAC charge pairs in every LC - MS run for recalibration without knowing their identity and minimize differ - ences between mass estimates from different charge states . The resulting polynomial remaps experimental m / z values to their cor - rected values . Nonlinear mass corrections are about 1 p . p . m . for the LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . We next use the two masses of peptide charge pairs to derive an estimate of the mass accuracy ( deviation from the true value ) from the estimate of the mass precision ( repeatability of the measurement ) by requiring that mass estimates are within the error range . We then scale the bootstrap errors by the required factor—between two to three in our data . As in similar cases 18 , this factor is likely due to autocorrelation between the centroid determinations in subsequent spectra . To correct for global expansion or contraction of the mass scale we use well - identiﬁed pep - tides and minimize the mass deviation of these peptides weighed by their individual mass precisions . We plotted the corrected mass precisions for the 477 , 511 SILAC pairs in our data set as a function of peptide signal ( Fig . 3a ) . Mass pre - cisions are extremely high ( p . p . b . ) and roughly proportional to one over the square root of the peptide signal . Figure 3b shows that 50 % of the peaks have corrected mass precisions better than 393 p . p . b . In agreement with this , the actual mass deviations of all identiﬁed peptides ( measured minus calculated mass ) have a s . d . of 409 p . p . b . and average absolute mass devia - tion ( average of the absolute value of the difference between measured and calculated masses ) of 278 p . p . b . ( Fig . 3c ) . Peptide mass estimates are usually taken from the MS peak that leads to selecting the peptide for fragmentation ( Fig . 3d ) . Average absolute mass accuracy in this standard approach is 1 . 8 p . p . m . and s . d . is 2 . 5 p . p . m . Thus mass accuracy measured as s . d . , a key performance parameter in proteomics 19 , improved sixfold using our computational approach . We suspect the improvement would have been even greater if we had not used the ‘lock mass option’ 20 . Worse , even including the lock mass , the normal approach would have necessitated a maximum allowed mass deviation of 10 p . p . m . for all peptides , whereas searches are performed with much tighter and individualized mass tolerances in MaxQuant . Peptide and protein identiﬁcation Because the SILAC state of most isotope patterns is known beforehand , we can treat the label modiﬁcations as ﬁxed in the database search . By counting the number of arginines and lysines , the SILAC state distinguishes limit tryptic peptides from incompletely cleaved ones . This a priori information decreases the search space about tenfold . For fragmentation spectra not associated with a SILAC pair , a conventional database search is performed . After a database search , the list of top ten sequences matching a fragmentation spectrum is sorted according to their peptide score or P - score 21 and ﬁltered for consistency with a priori information , retaining the best scoring one . We allow a deviation between the measured and calculated mass of four s . d . of the individual bootstrap error for each peptide . We use a database containing all true protein sequences , concate - nated with reversed nonsense versions of these sequences 22 , 23 . To avoid spurious correlations because half of the reversed tryptic peptides have the same mass as the forward sequence , we also swapped every arginine and lysine with the preceding amino acid in the reversed sequences . This approach still retains the local amino acid relations— leading to the same length and mass distributions of peptides ( Supplementary Notes ) . To assess the likelihood of false identiﬁcation we generate two lists of peptides , one for the hits in the forward sequences and one in the reversed sequences . We construct two histograms by gaussian kernel smoothing ( Fig . 4 ) .

The probability of a false hit , given the peptide identiﬁcation score and the length of the peptide is then p X ¼ false j s ; L ð Þ ¼ p s ; L j X ¼ false ð Þ p X ¼ false ð Þ p s ; L ð Þ the posterior error probability ( PEP ) of each individual peptide . We use the PEP only as input for calculating the false - discovery rate ( FDR ) below . The a priori probability p ( X ¼ false ) is a constant with no effect on the ﬁnal list of accepted peptides at a given FDR . Longer peptides , which are less frequent in the database , are automatically accepted with lower scores . To determine a cutoff score for a speciﬁc FDR , we sort all peptide identiﬁcations , from the forward and the reverse database , by their PEP , starting with the best . Peptides are accepted until 1 % of reverse hits / forward hits has accumulated . The fraction of wrong iden - tiﬁcations in the forward database is then 1 % as well . In this run , 11 , 299 sequencing events led to 7 , 307 peptide identiﬁcations ( identiﬁcation rate of 64 . 7 % , Fig . 5 ) . Sequencing events associated with SILAC pairs have identiﬁca - tion rates of 84 . 4 % . Identiﬁcations ( red squares ) cluster in particular regions of the contour plot ( Fig . 5a ) , with characteristic polymer patterns devoid of peptide identiﬁ - cations ( Fig . 5b ) and fragmentation events in peptide - rich regions almost uniformly identi - ﬁed ( Fig . 5c ) . Note that many SILAC pairs were not targeted for sequencing at all ( 32 . 3 % in this run ) . We next assemble peptide hits into protein hits , a nontrivial step in shotgun proteo - mics 24 . Whenever the set of identiﬁed peptides in one protein is equal to or com - pletely contained in the set of identiﬁed peptides of another protein these two proteins are joined in a protein group . Shared peptides are most parsimoniously associated with the group with the highest number of identiﬁed peptides ( ‘razor’ peptides 24 ) but remain in all groups where they occur . Protein quantiﬁcation may then be per - formed based only on unique peptides , including razor peptides , or using all peptides . By default we use unique and razor peptides as a compromise between unequivocal peptide assignment and most - accurate quantiﬁcation . We assign to each protein group a PEP by multiplying their peptide PEPs . Only peptides with distinct sequences and only the highest - scoring identiﬁed spectra are used to avoid bias due to dependent peptides . Similarly to the peptide PEP , the protein PEP serves to sort the list of hits from forward and reverse databases . Using a protein FDR of 1 % and requiring that each protein group contain a unique peptide , we identiﬁed 4 , 149 proteins in the cell line proteome ( Supplementary Table 1 online ) .

For these peptides the m / z - elution time shapes of the 3D peaks belonging to the identiﬁed SILAC version are translated to the location of the missing SILAC partner and after integration of intensities , ratios are calculated in the same way as for SILAC pairs that were detected before identiﬁcation . Protein ratios are calculated as the median of all SILAC peptide ratios , minimizing the effect of outliers . We normalize the protein ratios to correct for unequal protein amounts . We next calculate an outlier signiﬁcance score for log protein ratios ( signiﬁcance A ) . To create a robust and asymmetrical estimate of the s . d . of the main distribution we calculate the 15 . 87 , 50 and 84 . 13 percentiles r (cid:1) 1 , r 0 , and r 1 . r 1 - r 0 and r 0 - r (cid:1) 1 are right - and left - sided robust s . d . For a normal distribution , these would be equal to each other and to the conventional deﬁnition of an s . d . A suitable measure for a ratio r 4 r 0 being signiﬁcantly far away from the main distribution is the distance to r 0 measured in terms of the right s . d . z ¼ r (cid:1) r 0 r 1 (cid:1) r 0 As a P - value for detection of signiﬁcant outlier ratios we deﬁne significanceA ¼ 1 2erfc z ﬃﬃﬃ 2 p (cid:2) (cid:3) ¼ 1 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 p p Z 1 z e (cid:1) t 2 = 2 dt which is the probability of obtaining a log - ratio of at least this mag - nitude under the null hypothesis that the distribution of log - ratios has normal upper and lower tails ( Supplementary Fig . 3 online ) . For highly abundant proteins the statistical spread of unregulated proteins is much more focused than for low abundance ones 8 ( Fig . 6 ) . To capture this effect , we deﬁne another quantity , signiﬁcance B , which is calculated only on the protein subsets obtained by intensity binning . We deﬁne bins of equal occupancy such that each contains at least 300 proteins . We quantiﬁed 4 , 100 proteins , comparable to the number of signiﬁcant messages in a microarray experiment on the same cell type 14 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . If a minimum of three quantiﬁca - tion events ( three SILAC pairs ) is required , quantiﬁcation becomes very reliable 25 , 26 because an outlier ratio has no effect on the median . Strikingly , 99 . 3 % of proteins were within 50 % of the one - to - one ratio . This implies excellent SILAC partner identiﬁcation as wrongly part - nered peptides would have ratios strongly deviating from 1 . We found 48 proteins to be signiﬁcantly upregulated based on signiﬁcance B with a Benjamini - Hochberg 27 FDR o 5 % ( Supplementary Table 2 online ) . Notably , two of the most heavily upregulated proteins after 2 h of EGF stimulation were the transcription factors JunB and the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 , also termed early - response protein NAK1 ( Fig . 6 ) . Both are known to be regulated by growth stimuli . Among the most upregulated proteins in Figure 6 there is a conserved dual - speciﬁcity tyrosine - serine phosphatase ( MTM1 ) , widely studied in relation to myotubular myopathy 28 and , like PTEN , a lipid phospha - tase 29 . The completely uncharacterized protein C1orf52 is tightly associated with the tumor suppressor BCL10 and therefore also called BAG for BCL10 - associated gene . Neither of these proteins was known to be induced upon EGF stimulation . Many of the other signiﬁcantly regulated proteins also have potential connection to growth factor signaling ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Proteins encoded by genes having regulatory binding sites for SREBP - 1 are shown to be signiﬁcantly upregulated when analyzed by TRANSFAC 30 . SREPB - 1 likely mediates the effects of EGF stimulation on cancer - relevant proteins like FAS 31 . DISCUSSION We have introduced a set of computational proteomics algorithms with several useful features . Efﬁcient extraction of mass information allows us to search protein databases with maximum allowed mass deviations that adjust themselves to the precision with which the peptide is measured . The mass accuracies achieved here are the highest yet reported in large - scale proteomics 32 and sharply limit the number of candidate peptides in database searches . With low - resolution data , only a few percent of fragmentation events lead to successful identi - ﬁcation 33 , whereas the mass accuracy and feature extraction in MaxQuant allow 73 % of the fragmentation events associated with SILAC peptide pairs to be identiﬁed . Thus , standard ion trap frag - mentation is extremely information rich , and nontryptic and modiﬁed peptides do not constitute the majority of fragmented peptides . The MaxQuant algorithms recently enabled comprehensive quantiﬁcation of the yeast proteome 34 . Although we identiﬁed essentially the complete proteome , we found only three ( o 1 % ) of the 814 ‘dubious’ open reading frames ( ORFs ) ( http : / / www . yeastgenome . org / ) , which are not expected to be expressed from evidence such as comparative genome sequencing . This provides independent evidence that our FDR estimates of peptide and protein identiﬁcations are very stringent ( Supplementary Fig . 4 online ) . Much higher identiﬁcation rates among dubious ORFs ( 3 % ) were found in genome - wide tagging experiments 35 , 36 . Likewise , aggregate data from yeast proteome resources cover 12 % of these dubious ORFs 37 , the same percentage as their occurrence in the genome . We have already applied MaxQuant to quantify 4 5 , 000 proteins in the mouse stem cell proteome 38 and several other proteomes in similar depth . We conclude that the computational tools for proteome - wide quantiﬁcation are now in hand . With further advances in instrumen - tation , particularly in the dynamic range of measurements 39 , 40 , proteomics should be suitable for routine ‘functional genomics’ experiments , for which microarrays have so far been the only option . 0 . 1 1 Protein ratio JUNB C1orf52 NR4A1 OBSCN MTM1 KIAA1429 10 1e6 1e8 1e10 I n t en s i t y Figure 6 Proteome - wide accurate quantiﬁcation and signiﬁcance .

MaxQuant is developed for the . NET framework and written in the C # language . The interactive 3D data viewer was developed on the basis of DirectX . MaxQuant executables are available via http : / / www . maxquant . org / , whereas the source code of algorithms is available in Supplementary Data . It runs on Windows desktop computers and is compatible with XP and Vista . Processing time is currently about 20 min per raw ﬁle and per processing core . Detailed description of the algorithms used in MaxQuant can be found in Supplementary Notes . Data processing . The Mascot program version 2 . 2 . 04 was used to generate up to ten peptide sequence candidates per fragmentation spectrum ( Matrix Science ) , and International Protein Index ( IPI ) version 3 . 48 was searched . The database search is done with an initial maximum allowed mass deviation of 7 p . p . m . for the peptide mass and 0 . 5 m / z units for fragmentation peaks , which is optimal for linear ion trap data 41 . Gene Ontology , Pfam domain and TRANSFAC overrepresentation analysis . P - values for overrepresentation in regulated proteins were calculated with the Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney test on the continuous signiﬁcance B values calcu - lated by the MaxQuant software . Data used in analysis . The data used in this analysis have been published in reference 14 . SILAC was performed as described 42 . Brieﬂy , HeLa cells were stimulated with EGF for 2 h and mass spectrometric analysis performed as described 20 . ‘Heavy’ ( EGF stimulated ) and ‘light’ ( control ) SILAC cell popula - tions were combined and lysed . Proteins were digested in solution with trypsin , and the resulting peptides were separated by isoelectric focusing into 24 fractions with an Agilent 3100 OFFGEL Fractionator . Each fraction was puriﬁed with StageTips 43 and analyzed by liquid chromatography combined with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Thermo Scientiﬁc LTQ Orbitrap mass spectro - meter with lock mass calibration 20 . The experiment was performed in triplicate .
