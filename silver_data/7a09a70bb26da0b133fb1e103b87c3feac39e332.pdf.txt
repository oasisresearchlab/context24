Dear Editor , The first confirmed case of SARS - CoV - 2 in the city of Barcelona , Spain , was identified on February 25th , 2020 . Since then , the epidemic spread countrywide , and Spain has become the second most affected country worldwide ( 130 , 759 cases , on April 5 th ) after the United States , and the second in the number of deaths ( 12 , 418 deaths , on April 5 th ) after Italy ( Our World in Data , 2020 ) . The regions most affected are Madrid and Catalonia , where Barcelona is located ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The transmission of coronaviruses can be affected by several factors , including the climate ( Hemmes et al . , 1962 ) . Therefore , it is essential to understand the role that weather conditions could have on the transmission of COVID - 19 . However , there is still a lack of evidence . A previous study in the four major Chinese cities suggested that the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with the temperature , increasing the daily incidence rate with lower temperatures ( Tan et al . , 2005 ) . Recent preprint studies using national data from countries affected by COVID - 19 reported that low temperature is beneficial to the viral transmission ( Triplett 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020a ; Wang et al . , 2020b ) . However , these should be taken with caution since have not yet been peer reviewed . We collected daily incident diagnosed cases confirmed from PCR tests in the Barcelona’s Health Region ( Regió Sanitària de Barcelona ) , between March 2 nd and April 5 th , 2020 . Data was collected from the COVID - 19 registry of PCR tests by the Health Evaluation and Quality Agency of Catalonia ( AQuAs , 2020 ) . Daily maximum temperature was provided by the Meteorological Service of Catalunya ( MeteoCat ) . We fitted a quasi - Poisson regression model allowing for features specific to the infectious disease context ( Imai et al . , 2015 ) . We adjusted for linear and quadratic trends , weekends , and the lookdown period ( after March 16 th ) , and accounting for residual autocorrelation by adjusting for the logarithm of lagged outcome ( Brumback et al . , 2000 ) . Since the incubation the median incubation period for COVID - 19 is just over 5 - 6 days ( Lauer et al . , 2020 ) , we used a one week distributed lag model ( Gasparrini et al . , 2010 ) . The incidence rate of a positively diagnosed case of COVID - 19 ranged from 0 to 60 % and daily maximum temperature between 12 . 2ºC and 22 . 8ºC ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . An average increase of 1ºC of maximum temperature decreased the incidence rate by - 7 . 5 % ( 95 % CI = [ - 12 . 3 ; - 2 . 6 ] ) on the same day ( lag 0 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Afterward , the temperature effect almost disappears , being substantially reduced from lag 1 to lag 6 . We evaluated the linearity of the associations without observing evidence of departure from linearity ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . Temperature is an essential factor in people’s living environment , which can play a significant role in public health in terms of epidemic development and control ( McMichael et al . , 2008 ) . There is a specific temperature that best fits the benefit of the virus and that lower temperatures contribute to the transmission because it is when the vulnerability increases . Thus , the arrival of summer could reduce the transmission of the COVID - 19 . Our result agreed with those already reported in other geographical locations , showing how the number of diagnosed cases increase below a maximum temperature of 10 ºC and linearly decreasing afterward ( Triplett 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2020b ) . However , these are cross - sectional studies at the country scale , which might have some measurement error due to high spatial variability when estimating a fixed temperature exposure for large geographic areas ( Soares et al . , 2012 ) . Our study considers a smaller area , mainly defined by Barcelona’s metropolitan area , where the daily variability of maximum temperature can be estimated more accurately . However , we have not been able to account for socioeconomic status or other meteorological factors , such as ultraviolet radiation or absolute humidity . While daily mortality could be a more robust indicator of the virus behavior , because it is not affected by the number of people tested , mortality may have different incident lag , from days to weeks from the diagnostic . We used instead of the incidence rate of positive diagnosed COVID - 19 confirmed with a PCR test . Although we adjusted for time - trends and accounted for residual autocorrelation , typical for in infectious diseases ( Imai et al . , 2015 ) , we are concerned that our finding could still be due to a spurious relationship due to the small number of days considered in our analysis . Our result has to be further explored ; however , it could provide a first clue to understanding the temperature - transmission relation of COVID - 19 since it shares genetic similarities with SARS ( Benvenuto et al . , 2020 ) .
