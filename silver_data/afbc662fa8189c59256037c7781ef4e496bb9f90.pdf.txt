Schneider Received : 24 January 2012 / Accepted : 2 March 2012 / Published online : 14 March 2012 (cid:2) Springer Science + Business Media , LLC . 2012 Abstract Locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) was initially characterized as a large primary tumor ( C 5 cm ) , associated with or without skin or chest - wall involvement , ﬁxed axillary lymph nodes , or disease spread to the ipsi - lateral internal mammary or supraclavicular nodes . Since 2002 , LABC has been reclassiﬁed to include smaller stage IIB tumors ( 2 to \ 5 cm ) with lymph node involvement , or stages IIIA – IIIB ( C 5 cm ) with or without nodal involve - ment . Despite the rather common presentation of LABC , it remains a poorly understood and highly variable clinical presentation of breast cancer that is a challenge to treat - ment . Here , we characterized a panel of breast tumors of known stage , grade , and key clinical – pathological parameters for the expression of the protein ezrin , which is involved in promoting signaling of the PI3K - Akt - mTOR pathway in response to extracellular and tumor micro - environmental signals , and is involved in breast cancer invasion and metastasis . We show that ezrin , which resides primarily in the apical membrane in normal breast epi - thelium , relocalizes primarily to the cytoplasm in [ 80 % of traditional ( T3 ) invasive ductal LABC tumors ( C 5 cm ) . Cytoplasmic ezrin is very strongly associated with a single characteristic in breast cancer—large tumor size . In con - trast , in large non - malignant ﬁbroadenomas , ezrin staining was similar to that of normal breast epithelium . Small ( T1 , 1 cm ) invasive ductal carcinomas displayed largely apical membrane and perinuclear ezrin localization with weak cytoplasmic staining . Cytoplasmic ezrin localization was also associated with positive lymph node status , but no other clinical – pathological features , including hormone receptor status , histological or nuclear grade of tumor cell . The cytoplasmic relocalization of ezrin may therefore represent a novel marker for large malignant tumor size , reﬂecting the unique biology of LABC . Keywords Ezrin (cid:2) ERM proteins (cid:2) Breast cancer (cid:2) Locally advanced (cid:2) mTOR Introduction Ezrin is a member of the ezrin / radixin / moesin ( ERM ) family of proteins . The ERM proteins interact with both membrane proteins and the actin cytoskeleton , serving as membrane – cytoskeleton organizers [ 1 , 2 ] . Ezrin also plays key roles in growth - factor receptor signaling [ 3 , 4 ] and regulates several cell signaling pathways , including the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt / mTOR pathway Alan A .

Based on protein binding activities , ezrin and other ERM proteins are thought to be involved in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions , including extracellular matrix interactions , cell – cell com - munication , apoptosis , carcinogenesis , and metastasis [ 6 – 8 ] . It has been proposed that increased expression of ezrin is associated with epithelial tumor progression and metastasis through the interaction of metastasis - associated cell surface proteins and increased signal transduction by Ras , Akt / mTOR and other pathways [ 8 , 9 ] . Ezrin up - regulation has been associated with increased metastatic potential in vari - ous tumor types , including osteosarcoma [ 10 ] , rhabdomyo - sarcoma [ 11 ] , carcinomas of the pancreas [ 12 ] , ovary [ 13 , 14 ] , endometrium [ 15 , 16 ] , and breast [ 17 , 18 ] . A positive correlation was reported between increased cytoplasmic ezrin localization and adverse tumor characteristics in a heterogeneous group of breast cancers . This included high grade , high levels of Ki - 67 expression ( a mitotic prolifera - tion marker ) , hormone receptor negativity , and lymph node metastases . Apical membrane localization of ezrin was found in normal breast epithelium and was associated with favorable characteristics of breast tumors [ 17 ] . We are particularly interested in a distinct form of breast cancer known as locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) . LABC is a very common clinical presentation in developing countries , comprising between 30 and 60 % of cases , and in 30 % of medically underserved women in the US [ 19 ] . Due to its late stage at presentation , LABC presents a serious challenge for treatment . There remains little understanding of LABC at a molecular level . LABC is classically charac - terized as a stage IIIB clinical presentation of a large primary tumor ( C 5 cm ) , with or without skin or chest - wall involve - ment , with ﬁxed axillary lymph nodes or with disease spread to the ipsilateral internal mammary or supraclavicular nodes , but without distant metastasis at presentation [ 20 ] . The American Joint Committee for Cancer ( AJCC ) 2002 staging guidelines classify LABC as any stage IIB smaller breast cancers with lymph node involvement , as well as stages IIIA or IIIB , with or without lymph node involvement [ 21 ] . The reclassiﬁcation of LABC makes sense from the clinical perspective of treatment outcomes , although at a molecular level large locally advanced breast tumors are likely bio - logicallydistinct from smaller aggressive breast cancers with multiple lymph node involvement [ 22 ] . Ezrin is involved in human tumor development and invasiveness as both an effector and a regulator of several signal transduction pathways , particularly the mTOR / 4E - BP axis [ 23 ] . A number of studies have linked increased ezrin expression levels to increased metastatic potential and reduced survival in a variety of human cancers [ 15 , 24 – 28 ] . However , ezrin functions to connect cell membrane receptor signaling to cytoplasmic events , and as such , its intracellular relocalization is of critical importance in its function . Nevertheless , studies to date have not systematically explored the relationship between ezrin cellular location and stage / grade and other key histopathological features with tumor development and progression . Given our previous work showing the importance of the Akt / mTOR pathway in LABC [ 22 ] , and the interaction of ezrin with this pathway , we investigated whether the cellular localization of ezrin is associated with speciﬁc clinical and pathological features of breast cancer . We show that the relocalization of ezrin , predominantly to the cytoplasm , is very strongly associated with large tumor size for invasive ductal carcinomas ( IDCs ) , comprising [ 80 % of traditional ( T3 , C 5 cm ) invasive ductal LABC tumors . Importantly , ezrin localization in large benign ﬁbroadenomas was identical to normal breast epi - thelium , displaying primarily apical membranous and weak cytoplasmic staining . Thus , the cytoplasmic localization of ezrin is a function of both large tumor size and malignancy . The strong cytoplasmic localization of ezrin , and loss of membrane association , is consistent with a role in promoting extensive invasion of LABC . Materials and methods Tissue specimens Tumor tissue specimens consisted of 121 primary breast cancer invasive ductal carcinoma specimens stages I – IV ( Table 1 ) , and 20 ﬁbroadenoma specimens from 2 to 3 cm in size . Specimens were obtained from archival parafﬁn blocks obtained between 1996 and 2006 . Breast cancer patients were aged 27 – 79 years , patients with ﬁbroadenomas were aged 25 – 40 years , and all were treated at the NYU School of Medicine or New York Hospital Medical Center . Samples were selected as blindly coded specimens under a HIPAA - compliant protocol approved by the NYU School of Medi - cine and New York Hospital Medical Center Institutional Review Boards . All tumor specimens were obtained from pretreatment surgical resections or pretreatment tumor core biopsies . Final breast cancer diagnosis was conﬁrmed by pathological examination . Pretreatment tumor size was determined at surgical pathology ( T1 and smaller T2 tumors ) or clinically by caliper measurement ( large T2 tumors [ 4 cm and T3 tumors C 5 cm ) . Normal breast epithelium specimens were obtained from reduction mammoplasty samples avail - able at the NYU School of Medicine and were provided in a blind fashion , without personal identiﬁers . Immunohistochemistry All kits and developing substrates were obtained from Vector Laboratories . Parafﬁn - embedded specimens were deparafﬁnized and rehydrated followed by antigen retrieval 982 Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2012 ) 134 : 981 – 988 123 using antigen retrieval solution ( Vector labs ) . Sections were incubated in 5 % hydrogen peroxide for 30 min before staining using the Universal Vectastain - ABC horseradish peroxidase Kit and incubated with the 3C12 anti - ezrin anti - body at a 1 : 1 , 000 dilution ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Slides were developed with the DAB Substrate Kit , dehydrated , dried , and mounted using VectaMount Permanent Mounting medium . Immunoﬂuorescence Deparafﬁnized and rehydrated tissues were permeabilized by incubation in 0 . 25 % Triton - X in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , blocked in 3 % BSA followed by incubation with the 3C12 anti - ezrin antibody overnight at 4 (cid:3) C , washed three times in PBS followed by incubation for 1 h with tet - ramethyl rhodamine iso - thiocyanate ( TRITC ) - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) alongwith ﬂuorescent carbocyanine nucleic acid stain TO - PRO - 3 ( Stratagene ) for nuclear staining . Stained tissues were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with 4 0 , 6 0 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) DNA ﬂuorescent stain ( Vector Laboratories ) . Image acquisition was performed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss Axiophot Microscope . Statistical analyses Statistical analyses of laboratory results comparing ezrin localization and intensity by various clinical – pathological characteristics of breast tumors were conducted using the Chi - square test and Jonckheere – Terpstra test for ordinal charac - teristics , a measure of ordinal association , gamma , that is based on the numbers of concordant and discordant pairs of observations and the Cochran - Armitage test for trend [ 29 ] . P values \ 0 . 05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant . Results Descriptive characteristics of breast cancer patients are provided in Table 1 . The mean age at diagnosis was 59 . 5 years with 27 . 3 % of patients diagnosed with stage I , 44 . 6 % stage IIA – IIB , 23 . 2 % stage IIIA – IIIC , and 5 % stage IV invasive ductal breast carcinoma . Lymph node status was known for all subjects except one . The majority of breast cancer tumors were estrogen and progesterone receptor positive ( 76 and 57 % , respectively ) . HER2 / neu was over - expressed in 28 % of cases ( Table 1 ) . In this study , we deﬁned traditional LABC according to primary tumor ( pT ) size ( pT C 5 cm , stage III ) as well as using the AJCC criteria . Fifty percent of breast tumors in our study were LABC according to the AJCC criteria ( TNM stages : IIB , IIIA , IIIB , and IIIC ) , and 26 % were LABC according to Table 1 Characteristics of breast cancer patients Characteristic Distribution Age at diagnosis ( years ) , mean ( SD ) 59 . 5 ( 13 . 6 ) Age groups , n ( % ) \ 40 10 ( 8 . 3 ) 40 – 49 20 ( 16 . 5 ) 50 – 59 31 ( 25 . 6 ) 60 – 69 30 ( 24 . 8 ) 70 – 79 19 ( 15 . 7 ) C 80 11 ( 9 . 1 ) Tumor size , n ( % ) pT1 ( B 2 cm ) 29 ( 24 . 0 ) pT2 ( 2 – 5 cm ) 61 ( 50 . 4 ) pT3 ( [ 5 cm ) 31 ( 25 . 6 ) Lymph node status , n ( % ) Negative 57 ( 47 . 5 ) Positive 63 ( 52 . 5 ) Stage , n ( % ) I 33 ( 27 . 3 ) IIA 22 ( 18 . 2 ) IIB 32 ( 26 . 4 ) IIIA 22 ( 18 . 2 ) IIIB 0 ( 0 ) IIIC 6 ( 5 . 0 ) IV 6 ( 5 . 0 ) Histological grade , n ( % ) 1 8 ( 6 . 7 ) 2 61 ( 51 . 3 ) 3 50 ( 42 . 0 ) Nuclear grade , n ( % ) 1 8 ( 6 . 7 ) 2 65 ( 54 . 6 ) 3 46 ( 38 . 6 ) ER a , n ( % ) Negative 29 ( 24 . 4 ) Positive 90 ( 75 . 6 ) PR , n ( % ) Negative 52 ( 43 . 0 ) Positive 69 ( 57 . 0 ) HER2 b , n ( % ) 1 ? 48 ( 44 . 0 ) 2 ? 31 ( 28 . 4 ) 3 ? 30 ( 27 . 5 ) LABC - AJCC c , n ( % ) Negative 59 ( 49 . 6 ) Positive 60 ( 50 . 4 ) LABC - pT d , n ( % ) Negative 90 ( 74 . 4 ) Positive 31 ( 25 . 6 ) a ER and HER2 data were missing in 2 and 12 subjects , respectively .

Twenty archived ﬁbroadeno - mas ( * 0 . 5 – 3 cm ) were selected at random from patients aged 25 – 40 years . In normal breast epithelial cells , ezrin was concentrated at the apical ( luminal ) membrane surface with a weak cyto - plasmic distribution ( Fig . 1a ) . In breast tumor IDC cells , ezrin localization was found to change distinctly with tumor stage . In early stage IA breast tumors ( 1 cm shown ) , ezrin intracellular distribution localized with a strong perinuclear pattern and weak , cytoplasmic and membrane staining ( Fig . 1b ) . In smaller stage IIB tumors ( T2 , 3 cm shown ) , ezrin acquired a greater level of diffuse cytoplasmic staining and retained a weaker perinuclear and membrane distribu - tion ( Fig . 1c ) . In late stage IIIB large tumors ( C 5 cm ) , ezrin was almost exclusively conﬁned to a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution with little evidence for membrane association or perinuclear distribution in virtually all of the breast tumors ( Fig . 1d ) . Finally , ezrin distribution in 20 ﬁbroadenomas , ranging in size from * 0 . 5 to 3 cm , were found to be almost indistinguishable from normal breast epithelium , displaying primarily strong apical membrane and weak cytoplasmic staining ( Fig . 1e , f ) . Thus , malignancy and large tumor size together dictate an almost exclusive cytoplasmic accumu - lation of ezrin and exclusion of membrane association . To more thoroughly examine the cellular localization of ezrin in IDC breast cancers , specimens were subjected to immunoﬂuorescence staining of ezrin . Normal breast ductal epithelium displayed discreet apical expression of ezrin ( Fig . 2a , red stain ) , whereas mixed perinuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic staining predominated in intermediate stage II tumor specimens ( Fig . 2d ; representative 2 cm IDC shown ) . In contrast , almost all stage III LABC tumor specimens displayed primarily a pronounced diffuse cyto - plasmic staining with little evidence for membrane locali - zation ( Fig . 2e ) . Ezrin cellular localization and staining intensity were compared with clinical – pathological features of breast cancer . In particular , there was a highly signiﬁcant asso - ciation between ezrin cytoplasmic localization and tumor size . In fact , 80 . 7 % of the pT3 ( C 5 cm ) tumors showed diffuse intense and almost exclusive cytoplasmic ezrin localization , whereas the majority ( 69 % ) of pT1 tumors ( B 2 cm ) were characterized by apical membranous / peri - nuclear localization ( Table 2 ) . pT2 tumors , which range in size from 2 to 5 cm , showed a pattern of ezrin localization between that of pT1 and pT3 tumors ( Figs . 1c , 2b ; Table 2 ) , consistent with increased size of malignant IDCs dictating increased cytoplasmic distribution . Lymph node positive tumors , which generally include larger tumors , were signiﬁcantly associated ( P = 0 . 005 ) with diffuse cytoplasmic ezrin staining ( 61 . 9 % ) , whereas lymph node negative tumors , which tend to be smaller pT1 tumors , were more likely to be associated with perinuclear ( 38 . 6 % ) ezrin staining ( Table 2 ) . There was no statistically signiﬁcant association between ezrin intracellular localiza - tion and tumor histological or nuclear grade ( Table 2 ) . There was also no signiﬁcant association between ezrin localiza - tion and ER / PR or Her2 / neu receptor status ( Table 2 ) . LABC , according to AJCC criteria , was signiﬁcantly associated with both diffuse cytoplasmic ( 70 % ) and dif - fuse membranous ( 11 . 7 % ) ezrin staining ( Table 2 ) , con - sistent with the large range of tumor sizes included in these criteria .

Interestingly , a fraction of the advanced LABC specimens were signiﬁcantly reduced in ezrin expression , as determined by immunoﬂuorescence staining ( 11 . 7 % using AJCC criteria and 12 . 9 % using classical LABC deﬁnition ) . Importantly , neither apical nor perinuclear staining was observed in LABC specimens classiﬁed according to the classical criteria of C 5 cm tumor size ( Table 2 ) , again suggesting that LABC as classically deﬁned is a unique biological entity . Ezrin expression level was previously shown not to be associated with most breast cancer clinical – pathological characteristics , apart from an overall increase in breast tumors compared to adjacent stroma [ 17 ] . On the other hand , in other types of cancers , ezrin overexpression has been linked to increased metastatic behavior [ 8 ] , particu - larly in osteosarcomas , certain lung cancers , and pediatric sarcomas [ 10 ] . We therefore evaluated the relationship between ezrin expression level and clinical – pathological characteristics in our breast cancer cohort , using a 3 - point staining scale ( Table 3 ) . We did not detect signiﬁcant statistical association between expression level ( staining intensity ) and hormone receptor and HER2 / neu receptor status . However , we did observe a trend toward increased staining ( ? 2 / ? 3 ) of ezrin when combined with increased tumor stage and histological grade ( Table 3 ) . Discussion In this study , we observed that increased cellular cyto - plasmic localization of ezrin is strongly associated with large tumor size in breast cancer , and that diffuse cyto - plasmic ezrin localization in particular is signiﬁcantly associated with classically deﬁned LABC status ( C 5 cm ) . Using the new AJCC criteria for LABC that includes smaller tumor size ( 2 to \ 5 cm ) with multiple lymph mode involvement , there was greater variability in ezrin cellular staining patterns . Thus , these data , like previous work from our group , suggest that as classically deﬁned ( C 5 cm ) , LABC may have biologically distinctive features compared to smaller breast tumors regardless of stage [ 22 ] . There is accumulating evidence that ezrin localization or expression may play a role in breast cancer . A role for expression of ezrin in metastasis was demonstrated by using a highly metastatic murine mammary carcinoma cell line AC2M2 , although ezrin expression alone was not sufﬁcient to induce metastasis in animal models [ 30 ] . Ezrin likely participates in breast cancer metastasis via c - Src and PI3K / Akt effectors acting on tumor cell motility and invasion stages of the metastatic process . In addition , sig - niﬁcant associations were found between ezrin expression and poor outcome in breast cancer and high - grade sarco - mas when the expression of ezrin was studied in over 5 , 000 human cancers and normal tissues using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry [ 18 ] . Ezrin and other ERM proteins share highly homologous N - terminal domains , which bind plasma membrane pro - teins including CD43 , CD44 , CD95 , ICAM - 1 , ICAM - 2 , ICAM - 3 , and syndecan , among others , as well as the actin cytoskeleton . By organizing membrane – cytoskeleton complexes , the ERM proteins regulate cellular activities such as adhesion , migration , invasion , and survival , which are critical for tumor progression and likely point to a role for ezrin in these processes [ 1 , 2 ] . More recent data also suggest that ezrin and E - cadherin expression may serve as important markers in predicting lymphatic metastasis [ 31 ] and poor prognosis [ 32 ] of invasive ductal breast cancer . Interestingly , ezrin silencing by RNA interference using small hairpin RNA reversed the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in vitro [ 33 ] . Collectively , these studies make a strong case for ezrin expression in promoting malignant progression of breast cancer , although expres - sion level per se did not correlate with typical parameters of malignancy in our study or a previous one [ 17 ] . These data therefore focused our attention on the cellular locali - zation of ezrin in association with markers of breast cancer malignancy . Among these markers , only large tumor size was found to be associated with altered ezrin localization . Large tumor size itself is strongly associated with increased metastatic potential and reduced survival [ 20 ] . Sarrio et al . [ 17 ] suggested that the switch in cellular localization of ezrin from the apical membrane to either the complete membrane or to the cytoplasm is associated with dedifferentiation and adverse features in invasive breast Normal breast ductal epithelium Stage II 2 . 2 cm IDC Stage III 5 cm IDC ( LABC ) blue stain : TOPROL - 3 nuclear red stain : TRITC - tagged anti - ezrin antibody a c b Fig . 2 Immunoﬂuorescence staining of ezrin in normal breast epithe - liumandbreastcancerspecimens ( magniﬁcation , 9 400 ) .

A representative poorly differentiated 5 cm LABC is shown Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2012 ) 134 : 981 – 988 985 123 tumors and breast cancer cell lines . In our study , we observed that stage III LABC tumors are primarily asso - ciated with diffuse cytoplasmic and some diffuse mem - branous ezrin expression , whereas early stage tumors showed strong perinuclear staining . We found no statisti - cally signiﬁcant association between ezrin localization and other tumor characteristics such as grade , estrogen / pro - gesterone receptor , and HER2 status . Thus , our ﬁndings provide an important understanding of the association of ezrin in breast cancer not previously identiﬁed . We suggest that the switch in ezrin localization to the cytoplasm might serve as an independent marker of LABC potential . We also observed that in a subset of large breast tumors ( 10 – 12 % ) there is a trend toward an inverse relationship between intensity of ezrin staining and primary tumor size , suggesting that intensity of ezrin staining weakens with large primary tumor size in this group . Ezrin promotes tumor cell survival by directly binding to PI3K and activating PI3K / Akt - dependent mTOR , in turn stimulating the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase Table 2 Ezrin localization and clinical – pathological features of breast cancer Characteristic Ezrin localization n P value Apical Perinuclear Cytoplasmic Membranous Absent Tumor size , n ( % ) pT1 ( B 2 cm ) 2 ( 6 . 9 ) 18 ( 62 . 1 ) 8 ( 27 . 6 ) 1 ( 3 . 5 ) 0 29 pT2 ( 2 – 5 cm ) 0 15 ( 24 . 6 ) 35 ( 57 . 4 ) 8 ( 13 . 1 ) 3 ( 4 . 9 ) 61 pT3 ( [ 5 cm ) 0 0 25 ( 80 . 7 ) 2 ( 6 . 5 ) 4 ( 12 . 9 ) 31 \ 0 . 0001 Lymph node status , n ( % ) Negative 2 ( 3 . 5 ) 22 ( 38 . 6 ) 29 ( 50 . 9 ) 3 ( 5 . 3 ) 1 ( 1 . 8 ) 57 Positive 0 10 ( 15 . 9 ) 39 ( 61 . 9 ) 8 ( 12 . 7 ) 6 ( 9 . 5 ) 63 0 . 005 Stage , n ( % ) I 2 ( 6 . 1 ) 20 ( 60 . 6 ) 10 ( 30 . 3 ) 1 ( 3 . 0 ) 0 33 II 0 13 ( 24 . 1 ) 35 ( 64 . 8 ) 4 ( 7 . 4 ) 2 ( 3 . 7 ) 54 III 0 0 19 ( 67 . 9 ) 4 ( 14 . 3 ) 5 ( 17 . 9 ) 28 IV 0 0 4 ( 66 . 7 ) 2 ( 33 . 3 ) 0 6 \ 0 . 0001 Histological grade , n ( % ) 1 1 ( 12 . 5 ) 2 ( 25 . 0 ) 4 ( 50 . 0 ) 1 ( 12 . 5 ) 0 8 2 1 ( 1 . 6 ) 24 ( 39 . 3 ) 28 ( 45 . 9 ) 4 ( 6 . 6 ) 4 ( 6 . 6 ) 61 3 0 7 ( 14 . 0 ) 34 ( 68 . 0 ) 6 ( 12 . 0 ) 3 ( 6 . 0 ) 50 0 . 06 Nuclear grade , n ( % ) 1 0 2 ( 25 . 0 ) 4 ( 50 . 0 ) 2 ( 25 . 0 ) 0 8 2 2 ( 3 . 1 ) 23 ( 35 . 4 ) 32 ( 49 . 2 ) 5 ( 7 . 7 ) 3 ( 4 . 6 ) 65 3 0 8 ( 17 . 4 ) 30 ( 65 . 2 ) 4 ( 8 . 7 ) 4 ( 8 . 7 ) 46 0 . 24 ER , n ( % ) Negative 0 7 ( 24 . 1 ) 19 ( 65 . 5 ) 2 ( 6 . 9 ) 1 ( 3 . 5 ) 29 Positive 2 ( 2 . 2 ) 26 ( 28 . 9 ) 47 ( 52 . 2 ) 9 ( 10 . 0 ) 6 ( 6 . 7 ) 90 0 . 62 PR , n ( % ) Negative 0 12 ( 23 . 1 ) 33 ( 63 . 5 ) 4 ( 7 . 7 ) 3 ( 5 . 8 ) 52 Positive 2 ( 2 . 9 ) 21 ( 30 . 4 ) 35 ( 50 . 7 ) 7 ( 10 . 1 ) 4 ( 5 . 8 ) 69 0 . 42 HER - 2 , n ( % ) 1 ? 1 ( 2 . 1 ) 16 ( 33 . 3 ) 25 ( 52 . 1 ) 4 ( 8 . 3 ) 2 ( 4 . 2 ) 48 2 ? 1 ( 3 . 2 ) 8 ( 25 . 8 ) 15 ( 48 . 4 ) 4 ( 12 . 9 ) 3 ( 9 . 7 ) 31 3 ? 0 9 ( 30 . 0 ) 17 ( 56 . 7 ) 3 ( 10 . 0 ) 1 ( 3 . 3 ) 30 0 . 89 LABC - AJCC , n ( % ) Negative 2 ( 3 . 3 ) 29 ( 47 . 5 ) 26 ( 42 . 6 ) 4 ( 6 . 6 ) 0 61 Positive 0 4 ( 6 . 7 ) 42 ( 70 . 0 ) 7 ( 11 . 7 ) 7 ( 11 . 7 ) 60 \ 0 . 0001 LABC - pT , n ( % ) Negative 2 ( 2 . 2 ) 33 ( 36 . 7 ) 43 ( 47 . 8 ) 9 ( 10 . 0 ) 3 ( 3 . 3 ) 90 Positive 0 0 25 ( 80 . 7 ) 2 ( 6 . 5 ) 4 ( 12 . 9 ) 31 \ 0 . 0001 986 Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2012 ) 134 : 981 – 988 123 ( S6K1 ) / eukaryotic initiation factor 4E - binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) pathway [ 5 , 34 ] . Suppression of ezrin expression either by small interfering RNAs or disruption of ezrin function by transfection of a dominant - negative ezrin - T567A mutated gene , leads to decreased expression and decreased phosphorylation of both S6K1 and 4E - BP1 [ 23 ] . We previously showed the importance of the mTOR pathway in LABC [ 22 ] . A direct interaction of ezrin with PI3K as a result of cytoplasmic redistribution , may there - fore lead to sequential activation of the PI3K / Akt / mTOR signaling pathway , which we have shown to be important for primary LABC tumor growth and angiogenesis . In conclusion , changes in ezrin localization ( diffuse cytoplasmic staining ) and intensity ( weak intensity ) are associated with an aggressive large locally advanced breast tumor phenotype and may serve as a novel cellular marker of classic LABC .
