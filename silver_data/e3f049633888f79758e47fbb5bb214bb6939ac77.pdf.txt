Here , we search for other binding partners for the IRSp53 SH3 domain and identify Eps8 as the major binding protein in fibroblasts and various cancer cell lines . Eps8 has been shown to form a Rac - specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex with Abi - 1 and Sos - 1 , which seems essential for ruffling formation induced by oncogenic Ras . We confirm the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex formation in vivo and the direct asso - ciation between Eps8 NH 2 - terminal proline - rich sequence and IRSp53 SH3 domain . This complex synergistically activates Rac by reinforcing the formation of the Eps8 / Abi - 1 / Sos - 1 Rac - guanine nucleotide exchange fac - tor complex , which mediates positive regulation of Rac activity . In addi - tion , IRSp53 / Eps8 complex formation as determined by fluorescent reso - nance energy transfer analysis , occurs at the leading edge of motile cells , and the motility and invasiveness of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells are sup - pressed by inhibiting complex formation . These findings implicate the importance of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex in Rac activation and metastatic behavior of the malignant tumor cells . INTRODUCTION Increased cell motility and invasiveness are key steps for metastasis of the tumor cells . Rac , a Rho - family small GTPase is known as a critical regulator of membrane ruffling caused by actin cytoskeleton rearrangement , and it has also shown to be involved in tumor metas - tasis ( 1 – 3 ) . WAVE2 is a WASP family actin - polymerizing protein that is essential for Rac - dependent membrane ruffling , directed mi - gration , and cardiovascular development ( 4 – 8 ) . Rac does not bind directly to WAVE2 , but it interacts instead in an indirect manner through IRSp53 ( 9 – 11 ) . IRSp53 has been best characterized as an adaptor protein between Rho - family small GTPases and actin cytoskeleton reorganizing pro - teins . In addition to Rac and WAVE2 , Cdc42 binds to IRSp53 and stimulates filopodium formation through Mena ( 12 , 13 ) . Shank1 is also linked to Cdc42 through IRSp53 , and mDia , a target protein for Rho , binds to IRSp53 in a Rho - GTP - dependent manner ( 14 – 16 ) . Eps8 was identified first as a substrate of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( 17 ) . It has been reported that overexpression of Eps8 leads to increased mitogenic signaling and malignant transformation ( 17 – 19 ) . Enhanced expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps8 has been detected in tumors and transformed cell lines ( 18 , 20 , 21 ) . At the molecular level , Eps8 has been reported to bind Abi - 1 and Sos - 1 and forms a trimolecular Rac - guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex ( 22 , 23 ) , which is important for passing the signal from Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3 (cid:1) - kinase ( PI3k ) to Rac ( 24 , 25 ) . We performed a comprehensive search for IRSp53 - binding proteins by pull - down assay . Here , we report that Eps8 is the major binding protein for IRSp53 in both fibroblasts and cancer cells . We also show that the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex mediates Rac activation and seems to be important for cell motility and invasion . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies . We used antibodies for IRSp53 ( 9 ) , Myc - tag ( Santa Cruz Bio - technology , Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA ) , FLAG - tag ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) , Eps8 ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) , Sos - 1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , actin ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eugene , OR ) , and Rac ( a generous gift from Dr . Toshifumi Azuma , Keio University Medical School , Tokyo , Japan ) . Construction of Mutant IRSp53 and Eps8 . IRSp53 - RCB , - middle , and - CT were prepared previously ( 9 ) . IRSp53 - SH3 and - (cid:2) SH3 were constructed by digesting the CT fragment with Pst (cid:3) restriction enzyme . Eps8 - Pr and Eps8 - Cont were prepared by inserting chemically synthesized oligonucleo - tides . The other fragments of mouse Eps8 were constructed by inserting the corresponding fragments amplified by PCR . Cell Culture and Transfection . The following cell lines were used : B16 melanoma cells ( the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research , Tohoku University , Sendai , Japan ) ; and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and MCF - 7 breast adenocarcinoma cells ( Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources , Osaka , Japan ) . NIH3T3 cells , COS7 cells , and A431 cells were maintained routinely in our laboratory . NIH3T3 , COS7 , and HT1080 cells were transfected by LipofectAmine2000 , LipofectAMINE ( Invitrogen Corp . , Carlsbad , CA ) , and FuGENE 6 ( Roche Applied Science , Indianapolis , IN ) , respectively . The [ 35 S ] - Labeling . The 280 (cid:1) Ci ( 10 MBq ) Redivue Pro - mix L - [ 35 S ] in vitro cell labeling mix ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) was used for cells in each 150 - mm diameter dish . Labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography with a BAS2000 imaging analyzer ( Fujifilm , Tokyo , Japan ) . Rac Activation Assay . We used 15 (cid:1) g of plasmid for transfection of COS7 cells in a 150 - mm diameter dish . As an indicator of Rac activation status , 3 (cid:1) g of pEFBOS - Myc - Rac - WT was always included . The remaining 12 (cid:1) g was divided equally for each plasmid ( indicated in Fig . 3 , A and B and Fig . 4 , A and B ) . Twenty - four h after transfection , the medium was replaced and starved for 24 h . Lysates were mixed with 100 (cid:1) g of glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - PAK - Cdc42 - and Rac - interactive binding ( CRIB ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose beads ( Amersham Biosciences ) . After 45 min of rotation , the beads were washed , and bound proteins were analyzed . The results for three inde - pendent experiments were quantified by measuring the band of interest with densitometer . The activity of Rac was evaluated by dividing the amount of Rac precipitated with PAK - CRIB by the amount of Rac in the lysate . The average and SE of three independent experiments were calculated . For the detection of activated endogeneous Rac , confluent cells on 150 - mm diameter dishes were starved for 24 h and used . Imaging of Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer ( FRET ) Efficiency Inside the Migrating Cells . Twenty - four h after transfection , a wound was made by scraping the cell monolayer across the dish with a pipette tip to generate motile NIH3T3 cells . Then , cells were incubated for an additional 8 h and observed with a TCS - SP2 confocal microscope ( (cid:4) 63 objective ; Leica Microsystems K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) . FRET measurement was performed with FRET acceptor photobleaching program of the Leica confocal software , ac - cording to the manufacturer’s instructions . Migration / Invasion Assays . Phagokinetic motility assays , migration as - says , and invasion assays were performed as described previously ( 8 , 26 ) . Cells were photographed with an Axiovert S10 inverted phase - contrast microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) . Statistics . All of the P s were determined according to Student’s t test .

We performed pull - down assays to identify novel binding proteins for the IRSp53 SH3 domain in various cell lines . Lysates from [ 35 S ] - labeled A431 , B16 , HT1080 , MCF - 7 , and NIH3T3 cells were incubated with GST - IRSp53 - CT containing a SH3 domain ( schematic is shown in Fig . 1 A ) . Bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography . We identified a major bound protein of (cid:5) 95 kDa in all of the cell lines ( Fig . 1 B ) . By MALDI - TOF - MS , we identified this protein as Eps8 . In Vivo and in Vitro Binding between IRSp53 and Eps8 . To confirm the in vivo interaction between IRSp53 and Eps8 , coimmu - noprecipitation analysis was performed . We observed a significant Eps8 signal in the anti - IRSp53 precipitates but not in the preimmune rabbit serum precipitates , confirming the in vivo complex formation between IRSp53 and Eps8 ( Fig . 2 A ) . We investigated next at which regions of IRSp53 and Eps8 this interaction occurs . Various truncated fragments of IRSp53 were pre - pared as GST - fusion forms ( Fig . 2 B ) , and pull - down assays were performed . We observed positive Eps8 signals in GST - IRSp53 - WT , - CT , and - SH3 precipitates , indicating that Eps8 binds to the SH3 domain of IRSp53 ( Fig . 2 C ) . To determine the binding site of Eps8 , Eps8 was divided into four fragments ( Eps8 - 1 – Eps8 - 4 ; Fig . 2 B ) , which were expressed as FLAG - tagged forms in COS7 cells . In pull - down assays with GST - IRSp53 - CT , there were strong positive signals for FLAG - Eps8 - WT and FLAG - Eps8 - 1 ( Fig . 2 C ) . This result indicates that Eps8 binds to IRSp53 via the NH 2 - terminal region , which includes a proline - rich sequence ( amino acids 207 – 221 ) . Then , we divided Eps8 - 1 into several regions that contain or do not contain this proline - rich sequence ( Eps8 - 1 - 1 – Eps8 - 1 - 3 , Eps8 - Pr , Eps8 - Cont , and Eps8 - 1 - (cid:2) Pr ; Fig . 2 B ) and performed pull - down assays with these GST - tagged Eps8 fragments . To verify that the binding was direct , purified His - tagged IRSp53 - WT was used ( the purity is shown in the left - end lane in Fig . 2 C ) . Significant signals of bound IRSp53 were identified by Coomassie Blue staining in the lanes with GST - Eps8 - 1 , - 1 - 3 , and - Pr ( Fig . 2 C ) , all of which contained the proline - rich sequence . These results indicate clearly that Eps8 binds directly to the IRSp53 SH3 domain via its proline - rich sequence in the NH 2 - terminal region . Cooperative Activation of Rac by the IRSp53 / Eps8 Complex . As described above , Eps8 has been implicated in the regulation of Rac . This observation prompted us to investigate the possible involve - ment of IRSp53 in the regulation of Rac . To analyze the amount of activated Rac , a pull - down assay with GST - PAK - CRIB was used , because the CRIB motif of PAK selectively binds activated Rac ( 27 , 28 ) . From lysates of COS7 cells expressing Myc - Rac - WT ( as an indicator ) with FLAG - IRSp53 - WT or FLAG - Eps8 - WT , we did not identify any significant change in the amount of precipitated Myc - Rac - WT ( Fig . 3 A ) , consistent with previous reports of Eps8 ( 23 ) . Surprisingly , when both Myc - IRSp53 - WT and FLAG - Eps8 - WT were coexpressed with Myc - Rac - WT , the level of activated Rac increased dramatically ( Fig . 3 B ) . This phenomenon was observed also when we coexpressed Myc - IRSp53 - CT , but not Myc - IRSp53 - (cid:2) CT , instead of Myc - IRSp53 - WT . These results suggest a positive interaction be - tween IRSp53 and Eps8 in the regulation of Rac . We hypothesized that an Eps8 / Abi - 1 / Sos - 1 Rac - guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex formation is stimulated by IRSp53 / Eps8 interaction . To verify this hypothesis , pull - down assays were per - formed with GST - Abi - 1 - WT from lysates of COS7 cells expressing FLAG - Eps8 - WT alone or with Myc - IRSp53 - WT . We found that the amount of precipitated FLAG - Eps8 and Sos - 1 increased significantly when Myc - IRSp53 - WT was coexpressed , which was also precipitated ( Fig . 3 C ) . Taken together , we concluded that the interaction of IRSp53 with Eps8 augments Eps8 / Abi - 1 / Sos - 1 trimolecular complex formation , resulting in activation of Rac . Essential Role of the IRSp53 / Eps8 Complex in Rac - Induced Rac Activation . On the basis of the findings described above and our initial characterization of IRSp53 as the downstream effector of Rac , Rac - induced Rac activation through IRSp53 and Eps8 was hypothesized . Then , we investigated whether the dominant - active form of Rac , Rac1G12V ( Rac - DA ) , is able to induce Rac activation . Lysates from COS7 cells expressing Myc - Rac - WT ( as an indicator ) and FLAG - Rac - DA were prepared and subjected to pull - down assays with GST - PAK - CRIB . Indeed , there was a significant increase in the amount of activated Myc - Rac - WT compared with that of cell lysates expressing Myc - Rac - WT alone ( Fig . 4 A ) , indicating that dominant active form of Rac can induce Rac activation . Next , we investigated whether the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex is involved in this Rac - induced Rac activation . We used the Eps8 - 1 fragment , which binds to the SH3 domain of IRSp53 and should inhibit complex formation between IRSp53 and Eps8 . We coexpressed FLAG - Rac - DA and Myc - Rac - WT with or without FLAG - Eps8 - 1 in COS7 cells and investigated the effect on Rac activation . The levels of activated Myc - Rac - WT were decreased significantly when FLAG - Eps8 - 1 was coexpressed ( Fig . 4 B ) . Coexpression of FLAG - Eps8 - WT or FLAG - Eps8 - 1 - (cid:2) Pr did not decrease the levels of activated Rac , suggesting that IRSp53 / Eps8 complex is important for Rac - induced Fig . 1 .

To confirm the inhibition of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex formation by FLAG - Eps8 - 1 , immunoprecipitation analysis was per - formed also with lysates of COS7 cell expressing Myc - IRSp53 , FLAG - Eps8 - WT , and with or without FLAG - Eps8 - 1 . We observed that the positive signal of FLAG - Eps8 - WT in the anti - Myc immunoprecipitates clearly disappeared by the coexpression of FLAG - Eps8 - 1 ( Fig . 4 C ) , and FLAG - Eps8 - 1 was instead coimmunoprecipitated , which suggests that FLAG - Eps8 - WT was competed away by FLAG - Eps8 - 1 . Taken together , these results implicate the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex in Rac - induced Rac activation . IRSp53 / Eps8 Complex at the Leading Edge of Motile NIH3T3 Cells . Next , we wanted to investigate the localization of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex inside motile cells . We used FRET analysis , because this method makes visible complex formation rather than colocaliza - tion . We used CFP - IRSp53 and YFP - Eps8 as donor and acceptor , respectively . The acceptor photobleaching method was selected to avoid the problem of bleed - through between excitation and emission channels ( schematic of acceptor photobleaching is shown in Fig . 5 A ) . We expressed CFP - IRSp53 and YFP - Eps8 in NIH3T3 cells , and a wound was made to generate motile cells . Moving cells were then fixed and observed . When we calculated FRET eff , a significant FRET eff signal was observed at the leading edge of the cells ( ROI1 ; 16 . 7 (cid:8) 1 . 4 % ) compared with other areas inside the cells ( ROI2 ; 2 . 2 (cid:8) 1 . 3 % ; FRET efficiency included ROI1 and the aggregation of expressed proteins observed elsewhere in the cells ; Fig . 5 B ) . There was no significant FRET eff signal in cells expressing CFP - IRSp53 with YFP or YFP - Eps8 - (cid:2) Pr and also in cells expressing YFP - Eps8 with CFP or CFP - IRSp53 - (cid:2) CT ( Fig . 5 B ) . These observations indicate clearly that IRSp53 / Eps8 complex formation and , most likely , Rac - induced Rac activation occur at the leading edge of motile cells . Fig . 3 .

The FRET observations suggested that the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex is involved in cell motility , presumably through the positive regulation of Rac - activity . Therefore , we planned to analyze the possible role of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex in cell motility . First , we looked at the amount of activated Rac in various cell lines , which we found in the early experiments that Eps8 is probably present ( Fig . 1 B ) . By pull - down assays using GST - PAK - CRIB , we found that Rac inside HT1080 cells is activated strongly compared with other cell lines ( Fig . 6 A ) . This high Rac activity in HT1080 cells is consistent with the findings that HT1080 cells possess an oncogenic mutation in the N - ras gene and show high motility and invasion ( 29 – 31 ) . Thus , we decided to use these HT1080 cells to analyze the importance of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex in cell motility . HT1080 cells were transfected , then seeded onto colloidal gold - coated coverslips , and allowed to migrate for 12 h . Fixed cells were visualized by anti - FLAG antibody , and the area of the tracks of expressing cells was calculated . Cell motility was suppressed signif - icantly by FLAG - Eps8 - 1 expression but not by FLAG - Eps8 - WT or FLAG - Eps8 - 1 - (cid:2) Pr expression ( Fig . 6 , B and C ) . In order to eliminate the possibility that the suppression was attributable to blockade of the interaction between IRSp53 and some other SH3 domain binding partners , such as WAVE2 , the effect of FLAG - Eps8 - (cid:2) Pr lacking the NH 2 - terminal proline - rich sequence that binds IRSp53 was also in - vestigated ( schematic of Eps8 - (cid:2) Pr structure is shown in Fig . 6 B ) . FLAG - Eps8 - (cid:2) Pr inhibited motility to a similar level as FLAG - Eps8 - 1 or FLAG - Rac - DN , suggesting that the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex is im - portant for cell motility . We also performed Boyden chamber assays to determine cell motility and invasiveness . The transfection efficiency of HT1080 cells was checked by green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) fluorescence ; it was 70 – 80 % ( data not shown ) . For counting the number of migrated cells , however , we used crystal violet staining instead of GFP fluorescence , because the GFP fluorescence from cells on the lower side of the chamber was too faint to allow for adequate quantification of the cells . Expression of GFP - Eps8 - 1 or GFP - Eps8 - (cid:2) Pr ( but not GFP - Eps8 - WT or GFP - Eps8 - 1 - (cid:2) Pr ) suppressed cell migration and invasiveness to - ward the lower side of the chamber . The difference in the migration assay was weak , but the decreased level was statistically significant and was comparable with that of cells expressing GFP - Rac - DN ( Fig . 6 D ) , which is consistent with the phagokinetic track assay results . Interestingly , the decrease of invading cell number in the invasion assay was significantly greater than that in the migration assay ( Fig . 6 D ) . There was no significant difference in the proliferation rate of expressing cells by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the decreased number of invading cells ex - Fig . 4 .

These results support the notion that the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex is especially important for the invasive behavior of HT1080 cells . DISCUSSION In this study , we identified Eps8 as the major binding protein for IRSp53 in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells and various cancer cell lines . Complex formation of endogenous IRSp53 and Eps8 was also confirmed . Taken together with the results of the functional characterization of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex , we propose that Eps8 is a novel functional partner for IRSp53 . We reported previously that IRSp53 is an adaptor protein that functions downstream of Rac ( 9 , 10 ) , and the results presented above indicate an additional role for IRSp53 as an upstream regulator of Rac . Thus , we concluded that IRSp53 is a bifunctional molecule and may mediate positive feedback on the Rac signal . A positive regulation of Rac via IRSp53 / Eps8 complex may underlie the spontaneous formation of polarity by neutrophils in response to chemoattractants , which has been observed in previous studies ( 32 , 33 ) . Although the authors have shown that the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 (cid:1) - OH kinase ( PI3k ) is important for it , the precise mechanism has not been revealed completely . Several possi - bilities can be considered about the relevance between PI3k - mediated Rac - activation and IRSp53 / Eps8 complex - mediated Rac - activation . There is a report suggesting that inhibition of PI3k activity cannot suppress polarity formation completely ( 34 ) . Therefore , the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex - mediated Rac - activation can be a novel route for positive feedback regulation of Rac , which can compensate the PI3k - mediated Rac - activation . Another case is that the IRSp53 / Eps8 com - plex plays a regulatory role during the PI3k - mediated Rac - activation . Indeed , Abi - 1 , an essential component of the Eps8 - containing guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac , has been reported to associate with the p85 subunit of PI3k ( 25 ) . Therefore , it may be possible that IRSp53 also participates in the complex formation with PI3k through Fig . 5 . IRSp53 / Eps8 complex at the leading edge of motile NIH3T3 cells . A , schematic repre - sentation of FRET determination by acceptor pho - tobleaching method . First , the emission intensity from CFP - IRSp53 ( D pre ) was acquired . Then , YFP - Eps8 was photobleached by repeated scan - ning with 514 - nm light . After photobleaching , the emission intensity from CFP - IRSp53 ( D post ) was again acquired . If FRET has occurred , the emission intensity from CFP - IRSp53 after photobleaching ( D post ) should become stronger than that before ( D pre ) , because the emission signal that has been consumed by YFP - Eps8 for FRET is also emitted . B , confluent NIH3T3 cells were transfected with CFP - IRSp53 and YFP - Eps8 . At 24 h after trans - fection , a wound was made by a pipette tip , and 8 h later they were fixed . FRET signals of motile NIH3T3 cells were observed by acceptor photo - bleaching method . ROI1 is the area photobleached . The FRET efficiency ( FRET eff ) of ROI1 and ROI2 was calculated as FRET eff (cid:10) [ D post ] - [ D pre ] ) / [ D post ] ( the area without positive donor signal was ex - cluded for calculation ) . The arrow indicates the moving direction of the cell . Similar results were obtained from three individual experiments , and in each experiment , all of the observed cells showed the similar tendency . The statistic data of FRET eff in ROI2 ( leading edge area ; 10 % from the tip of the cells ) and ROI1 ( inside the whole cell ) are shown in the table below the figure as mean (cid:8) SE . * , P (cid:9) 0 . 05 compared with ROI1 . 5242 RAC AND CELL MOTILITY REGULATION VIA IRSP53 / EPS8 Research . on April 20 , 2017 . © 2004 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Eps8 and Abi - 1 and exerts some regulatory effect on it . Now , we do not possess a clear answer to this problem , which should be the focus for future studies . One important question is whether the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex for - mation is regulated by external cues , such as growth factors . We performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis with lysates from growth factor - stimulated or mock - stimulated cells , although we have not found a significant difference in the amount of the complex ( data not shown ) . However , we do not think that this result does not necessarily exclude the possibility that the complex formation is regulated dy - namically in vivo , because lysis procedure destroys the cytoskeletal structure such as those seen at the leading edge , which may be required for maintaining the complex . More careful examination may be needed to solve this problem . In addition , it is possible that the signal transduction via the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex is regulated by extracellular stimuli . The simplest scenario is that the localization of the complex may be regulated . Accumulation of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex above some threshold level may be necessary for maintain - ing Rac activation at the leading edge and after cell movement . Additionally , both IRSp53 and Eps8 were identified originally as substrates for tyrosine kinases activated by extracellular stimulation ( 35 , 17 ) . Thus , it is possible that Rac - activating ability of the IRSp53 / Eps8 complex is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation . Many addi - tional studies will be required to clarify the mechanism of IRSp53 / Eps8 complex mediated signaling . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Dr .

The areas of the tracks by three independent assays are shown as mean (cid:8) SE . * , P (cid:9) 0 . 05 compared with the migrated area of empty vector , FLAG - Eps8 - WT , or FLAG - Eps8 - 1 - (cid:2) Pr - expressing cells . D , transfected HT1080 cells were seeded on the upper membrane of Boyden chambers . Fixed cells on the lower side were then stained with crystal violet . The number of the cells were counted and normalized against the number of green fluores - cent protein ( GFP ) - expressing cells . Data are shown as mean (cid:8) SE . * , P (cid:9) 0 . 05 compared with the number of migrated GFP , GFP - Eps8 - WT , or GFP - Eps8 - 1 - (cid:2) Pr - expressing cells . 5243 RAC AND CELL MOTILITY REGULATION VIA IRSP53 / EPS8 Research . on April 20 , 2017 . © 2004 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from 2 .
