During clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the dynamic assembly and disassembly of protein scaffolds comprising members of the bin - amphiphysin - rvs ( BAR ) domain protein superfamily constrain the membrane into distinct shapes as the pathway progresses toward ﬁssion by the GTPase dynamin . In this Review , we discuss how BAR domain protein assembly and disassembly are controlled in space and time and which structural and biochemical features allow the tight regulation of their shape and function to enable dynamin - mediated membrane ﬁssion . Introduction Adeﬁningfeatureofeukaryoticcellsistheabundanceoffunction - ally andstructurally distinct membranes . Rather than being stable entities , cellular membranes are in dynamic ﬂux , as they are constantly changing their shape and exchanging material between them , e . g . , via vesicular or tubular transport carriers . Dy - namic membrane ﬂux is essential for nearly all cell physiological functions , includingsecretion , cellsignaling , migration , anddevel - opment , among many other processes . Mechanistically , mem - brane ﬂux involves the ﬁssion and fusion of transport carriers or even entire organelles ( Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ) . During mem - brane ﬁssion , an initially continuous membrane is segregated into twoseparateentities ( Kozlovetal . , 2010 ) . Aprominentexampleof membrane ﬁssion is the internalization of parts of the plasma membraneanditssurroundingﬂuidbyclathrin - mediatedendocy - tosis ( CME ) , a process that requires membrane ﬁssion by mem - bers of the dynamin family of GTPases ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; PraefckeandMcMahon , 2004 ) . InthisReview , wewillfocus on the role of membrane - associated BAR domain protein scaf - folds ( Frost et al . , 2009 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) in promoting dynamin - dependent membrane ﬁssion . We will survey how bin - amphiphysin - rvs ( BAR ) domain proteins are recruited to distinct endocytic intermediates in a spatially and temporallywell - deﬁnedsequenceofeventsandhowtheirassem - bly remodels the underlying membrane . Finally , we will discuss how these scaffolds co - operate with dynamin to promote mem - brane remodeling and ﬁssion in endocytosis . Sequential Recruitment of Endocytic Proteins during Distinct Stages of Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis Endocytosis is an essential cellular process by which cells inter - nalize parts of the plasma membrane along with extracellular material to regulate a variety of functions , ranging from neuro - transmission to pathogen entry and development ( reviewed in McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ) . Cells have evolved several and perhaps partially overlapping pathways of endocytosis that have been classiﬁed based on their differential requirements for the coat protein clathrin and for dynamin ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . CME is initiated at the plasma membrane by the recruitment of early acting scaffolds ( i . e . , FCH domain only 1 and 2 [ FCHo1 / 2 ] and its relative SGIP1 [ Henne et al . , 2010 ] , epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 [ Eps15 ] , and intersectin [ Henne et al . , 2010 ; Pechstein et al . , 2010 ] and adaptors [ Cocucci et al . , 2012 ] , i . e . , the heterotetrameric AP - 2 complex , AP180 , and clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia [ CALM ] ) . These factors assemble at sites enriched in phosphatidylinosi - tol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) and generate a membrane template for clathrin protein assembly . During the following maturation process , the clathrin - covered plasma membrane area undergoes massive remodeling involving local deformation , resulting in a deeply invaginated spherical clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) . The late - stage CCP remains connected to the plasma membrane through a narrow stalk that ﬁnally undergoes dynamin - mediated ﬁssion to release a clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) , which concomitantly uncoats ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Endocytic membrane remodeling during CME is accompanied and presumably driven by changes in the local lipid composition . CCP initiation occurs at sites enriched in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a phosphoi - nositide ( PI ) synthesized on the cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the plasma membrane by type I PI 4 - phosphate 5 - kinases ( PIPKIs ) ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) . PIPKIs associate with and are activated by 882 Cell 156 , February 27 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . AP - 2 ( Krauss et al . , 2006 ) . As clathrin displaces PIPKIs from AP - 2 ( Thieman et al . , 2009 ) , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis is limited to early stages of CME . Late - stage CCPs contain the 5 - phosphatase synaptojanin , an enzyme recruited to CCPs and activated by the BAR domain protein endophilin ( Chang - Ileto et al . , 2011 ; Mi - losevic et al . , 2011 ) . Synaptojanin converts PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI ( 4 ) P , suggesting that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels may decline as CCPs mature . Recent work has shown that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis to PI ( 4 ) P may be part of a PI conversion system that governs CME by convert - ing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 : CCP maturation is accompanied by the clathrin - mediated recruitment of class II PI 3 - kinase C2 a ( PI3KC2 a ) , a large multidomain enzyme that synthesizes PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 from PI ( 4 ) P . Loss of PI3KC2 a or enzymatic depletion of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 stalls CME at the level of U - shaped CCPs , a stage prior to dynamin - mediated ﬁssion ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) . These re - sults suggest a mechanism whereby endocytic membrane re - modeling during CCP maturation requires PI conversion from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( Figure 1 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 recruits assemblies of SNX9 and its close relative SNX18 to late - stage CCPs ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 1 ) . SNX9 and SNX18 are members of the sorting nexin family of BAR domain proteins found at the plasma membrane and throughout theendosomalsystem , wheretheyexecutekeyfunctionsinmem - brane remodeling and protein sorting ( Cullen and Korswagen , 2012 ) . Unlike most other BAR domain proteins , which associate with acidic phospholipids with low speciﬁcity , SNXs ( Figure 2 ) speciﬁcally bind to PIs 3 - phosphates , including PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , and to some extent also to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 via their phox - homology ( PX ) domain . Depletion of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , either due to loss of PI3KC2 a or through enzymatic hydrolysis by overexpression of a mem - brane - targeted PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - speciﬁc 4 - phosphatase , interferes with the assembly of SNX9 at late - stage CCPs and with the formation or stability of ARP2 / 3 - and BAR domain protein - coated tubular membrane invaginations , accumulating in dynamin - 2 - depleted cells ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) . These data suggest a model whereby local PI conversion from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 at maturing CCPs serves as an endocytic checkpoint at which the selective recruit - ment and assembly of SNX9 / SNX18 prepares late - stage endo - cytic intermediates for dynamin - mediated ﬁssion and , hence , makes the pathway irreversible ( Figure 1 ) . We thus predict that thischeckpoint ( Aguetetal . , 2013 ) playsacrucialroleinregulating the ﬁssion process . BAR Domain Scaffolds Shape Different CCP Intermediates en route to Membrane Fission Numerous endocytic proteins have been identiﬁed and charac - terized that serve as protein scaffolds to regulate endocytic membrane remodeling , eventually leading to ﬁssion of late - stage CCPs . These scaffolds form rigid assemblies on the surface of membranes and impose their curvature onto the underlying lipid bilayer . Among these—as mentioned above—are several mem - bers of the BAR domain superfamily of membrane - molding molecules ( Frost et al . , 2009 ; Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with the scaffolding concept , CME is characterized by the spatiotemporally deﬁned recruitment and dissociation of distinct sets of BAR domain proteins ( Posor et al . , 2013 ; Taylor et al . , 2012 ) . BAR domains comprise dimeric a - helical coiled coils that bind to acidic membrane phospholipids with low afﬁn - ity and stabilize or induce membrane curvature to achieve a geometry that corresponds to the overall shape of their mem - brane - binding surface ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . Cryo - electron micro - scopic studies have shown that the local curvature of the BAR domain matches the curvature of the underlying membrane , often without noticeable change from the crystal structure ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , dimeric BAR domains constitute rigid scaf - folds for the generation of membrane domains with deﬁned cur - vature . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding , shallowly curved FER and CIP4 homology ( F ) - BAR domain proteins FCHo1 / 2 arrive at nucleating CCPs and have been proposed to induce or stabilize the invag - ination of the initially ﬂat plasma membrane into shallow early CCPs ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Accordingly , FCHo1 / 2 are depleted from late - stage CCPs and from free CCVs . Maturation of shallow Figure 1 . Endocytic Membrane Remodeling during Clathrin - Mediated Endocytosis CME is nucleated by coassembly of the shallowly curved F - BAR domain protein FCHo with endo - cytic adaptors such as AP - 2 and clathrin at PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich plasma membrane sites generated byphosphatidylinositol4 - phosphate5 - kinasetype I ( PIPKI ) . FBP17 and possibly other F - BAR domain proteins may be recruited to nascent early CCPs . CCP maturation is accompanied by membrane remodelingandpartialPIconversionfromPI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( orange ) to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( green ) catalyzed by phos - phatidylinositol 3 - kinase C2 a ( PI3KC2 a ) - mediated phosphorylation of PI ( 4 ) P ( pink ) . PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is re - quired to recruit the PX - domain - containing BAR domain proteins SNX9 / 18 to maturing CCPs that undergo constriction of the vesicle neck to form U - shaped intermediates . The highly curved BAR domain proteins endophilin and / or amphiphysin assemble around the constricted vesicle neck and aid the recruitment of the GTPase dynamin . GTP hydrolysis in dynamin ﬁnally catalyzes membrane ﬁssion , followed by uncoating accompanied by sequential synaptojanin - mediated hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI and possibly of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 ) P ( blue ) en route to endosomes . Cell 156 , February 27 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 883 CCPs to the preﬁssion stage is accompanied by recruitment of more highly curved N - BAR proteins , such as amphiphysin and endophilin ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . The inner diam - eter of N - BAR assemblies of endophilin or amphiphysin ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) on membranes matches the diameter of the neck of late - stage CCPs undergoing dynamin - mediated ﬁssion and ﬁts well with the ability of both proteins to recruit dynamin to late - stage CCPs ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Ring - stad et al . , 1999 ; Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ) ( Figure 2 ) . BAR domain dimers contribute to scaffolding and curvature induction through higher - order interactions . When recruited to membranes , BAR domain dimers further self - assemble through low - afﬁnity interaction sites ( Mim and Unger , 2012 ) ( Figure 2 ) . For example , CIP4 or FBP17 use lateral contacts and / or con - tacts at the tips of their F - BAR domains to form helical oligo - mers at tubular membrane surfaces ( Frost et al . , 2008 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . These secondary interactions are comparably ﬂexible and allow the rigid F - BAR dimers to rotate along the Figure 2 . Domain Organization , Structure , and Assembly of BAR Domain Proteins and Dynamin On the left , the domain organization of human FCHo1 ( Expasy accession number O14526 ) , FBP17 ( Q96RU3 ) , SNX9 ( Q9Y5X1 ) , endophilin A1 ( Q99962 ) , amphiphysin - 1 ( P49418 ) , and dynamin - 1 ( Q05193 ) are shown . In the middle , structures of the corresponding BAR domain dimers ( PDB codes 2V0O for human FCHo2 [ Henneetal . , 2007 ] , 2EFLforhumanFBP17 [ Shimadaetal . , 2007 ] , 2RAJforhumanSNX9 [ Pylypenkoetal . , 2007 ] , 2C08forratendophilin - A1 [ Gallopetal . , 2006 ] , 1URU for Drosophila amphiphysin [ Peter et al . , 2004 ] ) , and 3SNH for human dynamin - 1 ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ) , are drawn to scale in their proposed order of recruitment to CCPs from top to bottom . One subunit is colored according to the domain organization , and the other is shown in gray . At the right , the oligo - merization modes of the F - BAR domain of the close FBP17 homolog CIP4 ( top ) ( Frost et al . , 2008 ) , of full - length endophilin ( middle ) ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) , and of the constricted dynamin helix ( bottom ) ( Faelber et al . , 2012 ; Mears et al . , 2007 ) are shown schematically . Dimeric building blocks are boxed in green , and cylinders indicate the approximate diameter of the encircled lipid tubule ; the outer diameter of the protein - coated oligomer is indicated . In CIP4 , interactions of dimers are mediated by lateral and tip - to - tip interactions of the F - BAR domain to encircle a lipid tubule of low curvature . In endophilin , tip interactions are not as prominent and no lateral interactions are observed . Instead , helical oligomers are crosslinked by their N - terminal amphipathic helices .

This results in differently spaced helical oligomers with different curvatures . The sequential transition between such oligomeric forms might in fact be a mechanism for how rigid F - BAR domain scaffolds can generate increasing membrane curvature . In contrast to CIP4 , endophilin dimers lack prominent lateral interactions but employ their N - terminal amphipathic helices for crosslinking adjacent endophilin dimers ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 2 ) . The resulting open lattice of endo - philin N - BAR assemblies may compartmentalize the membrane surface to accommodate interacting proteins , most notably dynamin . The membrane - remodeling function of BAR domain pro - teins is modulated by additional sequence elements , in partic - ular , amphipathic helices or hydrophobic membrane insertion wedges nested into or ﬂanking the actual BAR domain ( Frost et al . , 2009 ; Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 2 ) . Amphipathic heli - ces have been found in an ever - growing list of membrane - remodeling proteins and are often unstructured until they insert in an asymmetric fashion into one leaﬂet of the membrane ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ) . In N - BAR proteins such as amphiphysin or endophilin , the partial penetration of N - terminal amphipathic helices into one leaﬂet of the membrane bilayer locally induces curvature and may thereby potentially destabilize the bilayer to facilitate ﬁssion ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) . The pro - pensity of amphipathic helices to induce membrane curvature also contributes to the ability of some BAR domain proteins to sense membrane curvature by detecting lipid packing defects ( Bhatia et al . , 2009 ) . The interplay between curvature induction , stabilization of curved membrane domains by BAR domain pro - tein scaffolds , and the destabilizing effects of amphipathic helix insertion are likely crucial for the spatiotemporal regulation of endocytic membrane remodeling and ﬁssion , as further dis - cussed below . In addition to these elements , BAR domain proteins often har - bor additional structured domains that modulate membrane binding or regulate their assembly . For example , the PX domain of SNX9 forms an intramolecular interaction with the tip of its BAR domain . This interaction is stabilized by a small ‘‘yolk’’ domain , which ensures the parallel orientation of the basic lipid - binding sites within the PX and BAR domains ( Pylypenko et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 2 ) . Similar to N - BAR proteins , an internal amphipathic helix of SNX9 was suggested to contribute to mem - brane remodeling . Several BAR domain proteins , such as amphiphysin , endophi - lin , SNX9 , or syndapin ( also termed PACSIN ) , contain N - or C - terminal SH3 domains that coordinate scaffold assembly with dynamin recruitment ( Figure 2 ) . In syndapin 1 , SH3 domains were shown to bind to the membrane interaction site of the BAR domain , therefore auto - inhibiting scaffold assembly and / or membrane remodeling ( Rao et al . , 2010 ) . Similar auto - inhibitory roles were suggested for the SH3 domains of amphiphysin ( Far - sad et al . , 2003 ) , endophilin ( Va´zquez et al . , 2013 ) , and SNX9 ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Yarar et al . , 2007 ) , though the exact mechanistic details are unclear . Auto - inhibition is thought to be relieved by binding of the SH3 domain to partially overlapping sites in the C - terminal PRD of dynamin ( Rao et al . , 2010 ) or , in case of SNX9 , to actin regulatory factors such as N - WASP ( Yarar et al . , 2007 ) . Dynamin Catalyzes the Rapid Fission of Clathrin - Coated Vesicles The actual ﬁssion reaction of late - stage endocytic intermediates in CME crucially depends on the GTPase dynamin , a protein that was originally discovered as a brain microtubule - binding protein and was later found to be involved in endocytosis by genetic loss - of - function studies in Drosophila melanogaster ( Chen et al . , 1991 ; van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) . Subse - quent studies revealed a general requirement for dynamin in CME and several other forms of endocytosis , a function inti - mately linked to its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP when assembled at appropriate templates ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ) . Whereas invertebrate genomes , such as those of C . elegans or D . melanogaster , encode a single dynamin gene , mammals contain three dynamin genes with distinct expression patterns and multiple splice variants . Dynamin 1 is the major isoform in brain , whereas dynamin 2 is ubiquitously expressed . Dynamin 3 is found in brain and testis as well as in a few other tissues , including lung . These isoforms are similar overall , though differences exist with respect to lipid binding , afﬁnities for SH3 domain - binding partners , oligomerization , membrane penetra - tion ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) , and GTPase activities ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . Whether these isoforms functionally overlap is unclear . Endocytic defects due to loss of function of dynamin 1 in knockout mice ( see below ) are fully rescued by re - expression of dynamin 1 or 3 but , surprisingly , not by dynamin 2 ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ) . This result suggests a functional specialization of dynamin isoforms in vivo that may relate to their differential cur - vature - generating and - sensing abilities ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Strong evidence from a variety of systems ranging from Drosophila mutants ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ) , knockout mice , and cells derived from them ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) to minimal liposomal systems ( Pucadyil and Schmid , 2008 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ) indicates a key role for dyna - min in membrane ﬁssion . Shibire mutant ﬂies carrying a defective temperature - sensitive allele of dynamin display rapid onset paralysis , synaptic fatigue , and a neuronal activity - dependent depletion of synaptic vesicles ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ) . At the nonpermissive temperature , the shibire mutant accumulates protein - coated endocytic intermediates at the presynaptic plasma membrane in larval neuromuscular synapses ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ) . Also , neuronal synapses from mice lacking dynamin 1 ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ) or both dynamins 1 and 3 ( Raimondi et al . , 2011 ) show a striking accumulation of cla - thrin - coated endocytic intermediates connected to the plasma membrane via long tubular extensions ( or stalks ) . Endocytic ﬁssion deﬁcits in these cells lead to a depletion of synaptic ves - icles . Conversely , dynamin , GTP under conditions of longitudinal tension has been shown to be sufﬁcient to mediate ﬁssion of liposomal templates ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) . In living cells and tissues , dynamin is recruited to CCPs in two phases . Initially , dynamin levels at CCPs are low ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) and may depend on the association with dynamin - binding endocytic proteins such as intersectin ( Koh et al . , 2007 ) , SNX9 / SNX18 ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2003 ; Soulet et al . , 2005 ) , and amphiphysin ( David et al . , 1996 ; Owen et al . , 1998 ; Shupliakov Cell 156 , February 27 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 885 et al . , 1997 ) , both of which also bind to clathrin and AP - 2 . Recent data using intensity - based thresholding of live images acquired by total internal reﬂection microscopy suggest that this early pool of dynamin may be part of an endocytic checkpoint that regulates maturation of productive CCPs ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) , though the precise mechanism remains unknown . During late stages of CME , a burst of dynamin recruitment is observed , probably reﬂecting assembly of the dynamin helix about 10 – 15 s prior to ﬁssion ( when measured in cultured nonneuronal cells ) ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . This burst phase of dynamin recruit - ment coincides with the accumulation of SH3 - domain - contain - ing BAR domain proteins such as endophilin and SNX9 , as well as actin - polymerizing factors at the neck of late - stage CCPs ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Loss of SNX9 / SNX18 , depletion of PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , or actin depolymerization all result in collapse of tubular endocytic intermediates induced by dynamin depletion ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Posor et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting a cooper - ative interplay between dynamin , BAR domain proteins including SNX9 / SNX18 , and actin in membrane ﬁssion . Such cooperation may involve the ability of actin to aid ﬁssion by fostering lipid phase separation , as recently proposed for both clathrin - medi - ated ( Yao et al . , 2013 ) and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Ro¨mer et al . , 2010 ) . A crucial aspect of endocytic membrane ﬁssion is its kinetics . In vitro studies of dynamin function on liposomal templates have shown that membrane ﬁssion requires seconds or even tens of seconds to complete , depending on membrane elastic proper - ties and the concentration of GTP ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . Though these timescales are grosslyconsistent with the kinetics of endo - cytic membrane ﬁssion of CCPs observed in nonneuronal cells ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , they are much slower than the time course of fast endocytosis at neuronal synapses in some systems . Recent elegant work on C . elegans neuromuscular junctions , stimulated by single light pulses to induce exo - and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and snap frozen within milliseconds , has revealed an ultrafast mode of endocytosis that operates within 50 – 100 ms ( Watanabe et al . , 2013a ) . Dynamin loss of function blocks ﬁssion of large , about 100 nm sized endocytic intermedi - ates , that in wild - type animals would be consumed by mem - brane ﬁssion within 50 – 100 ms , e . g . , much faster than the time required for dynamin alone to mediate scission in vitro . Ultrafast dynamin - dependent endocytosis has also been found in mouse hippocampal synapses , arguing for a conserved mecha - nism in invertebrates and vertebrates ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) . These data indicate that dynamin - mediated ﬁssion in neurons may be assisted by other factors ( Kononenko et al . , 2013 ) , most notably actin ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) , BAR domain pro - teins such as endophilin , amphipathic helix - containing factors , or membrane lipids . These factors thus will need to be consid - ered for a thorough understanding of the mechanism of mem - brane ﬁssion . Structural Insights into Dynamin Assembly Dynamin assembles into helical oligomers at membrane sur - faces , leading to massive stimulation of its intrinsic GTPase activity and remodeling of the underlying membrane ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1999 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . A recent series of structural studies on dynamin and dynamin - related proteins has provided unprecedented mechanistic in - sights into this reaction ( Chappie et al . , 2010 , 2011 ; Faelber et al . , 2011 , 2012 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . Besides the unstructured C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) , dynamin comprises four domains : the GTPase domain , the bundle signaling element ( BSE ) , the stalk , and the PH domain ( Figure 2 ) . A number of intra - and intermolecular interactions between these domains are required for dynamin’s helical assembly and for the regulation of its membrane - remodeling activity ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . The central domain mediating assembly into a helical ﬁlament is an antiparallel four - helix bundle called the stalk ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . The architecture of this domain is somewhat reminiscent of that of the SNARE complex mediating membrane fusion ; these helical bundles might provide the mechanical stability required for membrane - remodeling pro - cesses . The stalk stably self - associates in a criss - cross fashion via a symmetric hydrophobic interface . Such stalk dimers further assemble via two additional interfaces to form a ﬁlamentous olig - omer ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that assembly of dimers provides for some ﬂexibility , therefore allowing the dynamin helix to adapt to different tubular diameters ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ) . The PH domain of dynamin is interspersed between the stalk and mediates bind - ing to negatively charged membrane lipids ( Burger et al . , 2000 ; Ramachandran et al . , 2009 ) . Based on biochemical experiments and the localization of disease mutations , the PH domains were proposed to bind against a conserved surface of the stalk in solution . At this position , they may interfere with further assem - bly of dynamin subunits , thereby acting in an auto - inhibitory fashion ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ) . In the presence of membranes , the PH domains can switch to a position below the stalk . It has been proposed that insertion of bulky hydrophobic residues of the PH domain of dynamin 1 into the outer monolayer of the membrane ( Burger et al . , 2000 ) might contribute to membrane curvature induction en route to membrane ﬁssion ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . GTPase activity is not required for dynamin’s assembly on membranes but is required for membrane scission ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Marks et al . , 2001 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . The GTPase domains of dynamin can dimerize with low afﬁnity in the presence of GTP and with higher afﬁnity in the presence of a transition state analog of the GTPase reaction ( Chappie et al . , 2010 , 2011 ) . Following GTP hydrolysis , the GDP - bound GTPase domains are thought to dissociate into monomers . Cryo - electron microscopic studies have indicated that such GTPase domain dimers interlink adjacent dynamin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2 ) ( Mears et al . , 2007 ) . Nucleotide - hydrolysis - dependent rearrangements of such GTPase domain dimers might then pull neighboring stalk ﬁlaments along each other ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ; Faelber et al . , 2011 , 2012 ) . In this way , the dynamin helix may act as a molecular sling that constricts the underlying mem - brane , thereby increasing membrane curvature . How can this transition be achieved at the molecular level ? Dimerization of the GTPase domains triggers conformational changes in catalytic residues and the positioning of a catalytic cation as a prerequisite for activation of the GTPase reaction ( Chappie et al . , 2010 ) . The nucleotide - loading state , in turn , 886 Cell 156 , February 27 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . was shown to control the twist of the central b sheet of the GTPase domains , which then directs the movement of a three - helical bundle , the BSE , at the backside of the GTPase domain ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ) . The BSE is thought to function as a trans - mitter of conformational changes between the GTPase domain and the stalk . It adopts an open conformation toward the GTPase domain in the presence of a GTP analog and a closed conformation in the absence of nucleotide , the presence of GDP , or a transition state analog . The conversion between these two states might act as a GTPase - triggered power stroke . Cooperative Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins In addition to their roles in establishing curvature , BAR domain proteins are also thought to recruit dynamin to CCPs . A role for BAR domain proteins , in particular amphiphysin ( David et al . , 1996 ) and endophilin ( Ringstad et al . , 1999 ) , in recruitment of dy - namin had originally been inferred from the ability of their SH3 domains to interact with the PRD of dynamin . Moreover , acute perturbation of complex formation between these proteins and dynamin in lamprey reticulospinal synapses in situ led to the accumulation of late - stage endocytic intermediates ( Ringstad et al . , 1999 ; Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting that amphiphy - sin or endophilin cooperate in the recruitment of dynamin to the vesicle neck of CCPs prior to membrane ﬁssion . An overlapping function of amphiphysin and endophilin isoforms in dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane has recently been conﬁrmed in nonneuronal cells ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , binding of GST - tagged amphiphysin SH3 do - mains to dynamin was shown to prevent assembly of dynamin scaffolds , suggesting that BAR - SH3 domain proteins may nega - tively regulate dynamin assembly ( Owen et al . , 1998 ) . Electron microscopic studies , on the other hand , provided evidence for the formation of amphiphysin - dynamin ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) and endophilin - dynamin complexes on the surface of tubulated lipo - somes , consistent with a role of BAR domain proteins as recruit - ment factors for dynamin ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Sundborger et al . , 2011 ) . These studies also revealed an increased pitch of the dy - namin helix when coassembled with amphiphysin or endophilin . How coassembly affects the GTPase activity of dynamin and ultimately membrane ﬁssion remains controversial . Coassembly of dynamin with endophilin and amphiphysin on tubular lipid templates has been shown to reduce the self - assembly - stimu - lated GTPase activity of dynamin 1 ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ) , suggest - ing that BAR domain protein scaffolds might prevent the GTPase domains of dynamin from reaching each other across neigh - boring rungs of the dynamin helical ﬁlament . A more recent study using liposomal templates with low - membrane tension ( so - called SUPER templates ) conﬁrmed an inhibitory role of amphi - physin on dynamin’s GTPase stimulation but found little effect for endophilin ( Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . Yet another study reported stimulatory effects of amphiphysin on dynamin’s GTPase activity and on vesiculation that were dependent on liposome size and on the molar ratio of amphiphysin : dynamin ( Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the effect of BAR - SH3 domain proteins on the enzymatic activity of dynamin in vitro appears to strongly depend on the exact experimental conditions ( see also below ) . In vivo , the BAR - SH3 domain proteins amphiphysin and SNX9 are thought to be recruited to CCPs via their clathrin - and AP - 2 - binding sites ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2003 ) , i . e . , prior to the arrival of dynamin . Recent data suggest that endophilin , a pro - tein that apparently lacks the ability to associate with clathrin coat components , may undergo reciprocally cooperative recruit - ment with dynamin to the neck of CCPs . Depletion of endophilin reduced dynamin recruitment , whereas conversely , loss of dynamin interfered with endophilin accumulation at CCPs in nonneuronal cells ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) . Such cooperative recruitment may depend on the auto - inhibition of BAR domain proteins by their SH3 domains , which is relieved upon binding to the PRD of dynamin ( Rao et al . , 2010 ; Va´zquez et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , ﬁbroblasts lacking dynamins 1 and 2 display an accumulation of CCPs with elongated necks covered by BAR domain proteins , including endophilin , indicating that endophilin can also be recruited to the neck of CCPs independently of dynamin ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . In addition to BAR - SH3 domain proteins , dynamin recruitment may be modulated by autoregulatory mechanisms . Although the precise molecular details are currently unresolved , such an autoregulatory mechanism appears to involve intra - and inter - molecular interactions of the PH domain , the stalk and , possibly , the PRD ( Faelber et al . , 2012 ) . Upon recruitment to the bud neck ( i . e . , by BAR - SH3 domain proteins ) , this auto - inhibitory clamp would be relieved and oligomerization may then proceed without further aid from BAR - domain - containing scaffolds . It is also currently unclear what determines the exact dimension of the dynamin oligomer at the lipid template . In vitro in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs or GDP , dynamin can assemble into long ﬁlaments on tubular lipid templates comprising hundreds of turns ( Mears et al . , 2007 ) . In vivo , the situation may be different . Once the growing dynamin ﬁlament has embraced the bud neck , the GTP - loaded GTPase domains of opposing turns face each other , and the GTPase activity and mechano - chemical function is triggered . This step may prevent further assembly of dynamin subunits to the growing ﬁlament . It may thus be envisaged that comparably small dynamin collars comprising only one helical turn mediate the ﬁssion of CCP necks , consistent with recent experimental data ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ; Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . In such a scenario , BAR domain proteins would be required for the initial recruitment of dynamin to the bud neck but would not interfere with nucleo - tide - dependent interaction of neighboring dynamin rings . Solv - ing the mechanistic details of this puzzle is one of the important challenges for the near future . BAR Domain Proteins and Membrane Fission The direct involvement of BAR proteins in membrane ﬁssion re - mains controversial . Theoretical considerations suggest that rigid BAR domain scaffolds may promote tubulation but would not favor membrane ﬁssion ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) , as they would ﬁx the curvature of the membrane to the intrinsic curvature of the BAR scaffold . Thereby , they would block further constriction , a prerequisite for membrane ﬁssion . However , ﬁssion may be pro - moted by the ability of at least some BAR - domain - containing proteins to sequester PIs into stable lipid microdomains ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ) , resulting in the generation of a phase boundary Cell 156 , February 27 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . 887 that could aid membrane ﬁssion ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Similarly , hydrophobic membrane insertions of amphipathic helices or ‘‘wedges’’ often found within or adjacent to the BAR domain ( Bhatia et al . , 2009 ; Frost et al . , 2009 ; Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) could promote proper ﬁssion . Indeed , in vitro studies have pro - vided evidence that at least the N - BAR - domain - containing pro - tein amphiphysin can promote dynamin - dependent liposome vesiculation ( Takei et al . , 1999 ; Yoshida et al . , 2004 ) . Two recent studies have re - addressed this topic using high - tension giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) or low - tension SUPER templates as substrates for dynamin ( Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . Meineke et al . observed vesiculation of GUVs only when dynamin , amphiphysin or endophilin , and GTP were added together . Furthermore , GUV shrinkage was strongly dependent on the interaction of these BAR domain proteins with dynamin , as dynamin mutants lacking the PRD were unable to vesiculate liposomes . Neumann et al . reported that the iso - lated N - BAR domain of endophilin promotes dynamin - 2 - depen - dent vesicle release from SUPER templates , as did full - length amphiphysin , whereas full - length endophilin was ineffective . By contrast , SNX9evenpreventeddynamin - dependentvesiculation from SUPER templates , though it had been reported to stimulate dynamin assembly and GTPase activity on liposomes in earlier studies ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ) . Although these studies offer impor - tant insights into the cooperative action of BAR domain proteins and dynamin , it remains unclear how far such mixed oligomers assembled on artiﬁcial lipid templates faithfully represent the architecture of BAR domain protein - dynamin complexes at the neck of late - stage CCPs in vivo . One intrinsic caveat of such in vitroassays isthat theproteins added needtoinduceliposome tubulation as a prerequisite for ﬁssion . Tubulation among other factors depends on the size , composition , rigidity , and tension of the lipid templates ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) used , as well as on the concentrations of the proteins added to the assay . It is there - fore conceivable that the precise spatiotemporal choreography of recruitment and assembly of these factors to the neck of nascent CCPs in vivo ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) might lead to architec - tures of the resulting protein assemblies that differ substantially from those on lipid templates studied in vitro . In addition to their well - characterized roles in CME and dyna - min - mediated membrane ﬁssion , BAR domain proteins may also function in dynamin - independent processes . For example , arfaptins , BAR domain proteins interacting with small GTPases of the ADP ribosylation factor ( Arf ) and Arf - related protein ( Arl ) families , are required for secretory granule biogenesis at the trans - Golgi network , possibly via regulating membrane ﬁssion ( Gehart et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , the formation of plasma mem - brane structures called eisosomes in yeast , which potentially mark the site of future endocytic events , involves the BAR domain proteins Pil1 and Lsp1 ( Karotki et al . , 2011 ) , which self - assemble to generate stable lipid microdomains ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . In all of these cases , BAR domain proteins seem to oper - ate independently of dynamin , yet their precise mechanistic function remains elusive . Dynamin in Membrane Constriction and Fission The actual mechanism by which dynamin mediates membrane ﬁssion in endocytosis remains heavily debated . There is general consensus that dynamin needs to polymerize around the neck of a late - stage endocytic CCP ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ) , and a GTP hydrolysis - dependent structural rear - rangement of the oligomer then drives ﬁssion ( Chappie et al . , 2010 , 2011 ; Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . Helical assembly of dynamin was shown to result in constriction upon GTP hydrolysis ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ) , consistent with recent structural data ( discussed above , Faelber et al . , 2011 ; Chappie et al . , 2011 ; Ford et al . , 2011 ) . Whereas initial studies suggested that constriction was sufﬁcient for ﬁssion , subse - quent in vitro experiments ( Danino et al . , 2004 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) established that additional longitudinal tension is required . The diameter of the membrane constrained by unconstricted nucleotide - free dynamin has been determined by several methods , including transmission and cryo - electron microcopy ( Chen et al . , 2004 ; Danino et al . , 2004 ) and force measurements ( Roux et al . , 2010 ) , to be in the range of 20 – 25 nm . By contrast , there has been an intense debate as to how much further dynamin , GTP is able to constrict the underlying membrane . Available cryo - EM data of constricted dynamin loaded with a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog argues for a constricted diameter of about 10 nm , leaving a lumen of 5 – 6 nm ( Mears et al . , 2007 ) . However , it is known that this nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog does not induce membrane ﬁssion , opening the possibility that GTP - loaded dynamin may constrict the membrane even further . Whether dynamin , GTP is able to drive further constriction to a diameter in the range of the thickness of a single leaﬂet of the membrane bilayer ( < 3 nm ) where membrane ﬁssion becomes spontaneous ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ) remains to be seen . It thus appears likely that other factors , such as longitudi - nal tension , polarized actin assembly , or insertion of amphipathic helices ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) , aid in triggering membrane ﬁssion under physiological conditions in vivo ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . How is dynamin - mediated membrane constriction brought about mechanistically ? Reaching sufﬁcient constriction requires the sliding of adjacent turns of the dynamin helix over distances greater than the size of the dimeric assembly unit . In this case , bonds between GTPase domains from adjacent rings must be broken at least transiently . One of the unresolved questions , thus , is how the hydrolysis cycle of GTP and the resulting confor - mational changes within assembled dynamin are coupled to its membrane association and dissociation ( Schmid and Frolov , 2011 ) . If all links between adjacent turns were broken at the same time , the dynamin scaffold would be weakened and the membrane tube beneath would expand , leading to aborted ﬁssion . Clearly , the GTPase cycles of successive dynamin dimers have to be uncoupled to allow some to generate a confor - mational change and constriction force ( torque ) , whereas others are detached . It is tempting to speculate that BAR - domain scaf - folds contribute to such a mechanism—for example , by selec - tively anchoring one end of the helical dynamin ﬁlament to the membrane while the other would be free to move . The torque generated by dynamin in order to constrict a membrane below a diameter of 10 nm is huge , in the range of 1 , 000 pN . nm . As a comparison , proteins that unwind the DNA double helix usually exert torques of a few tens of pN . nm ( Lee et al . , 2013 ) , and the F1 - ATPase generates a maximal torque of 90 pN . nm . ( Kinosita et al . , 2000 ) . The resulting torque may enable dynamin to 888 Cell 156 , February 27 , 2014 ª 2014 Elsevier Inc . constrict the membrane even further than 10 nm in diameter ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . It also makes dynamin one of the strongest mechano - enzymes known , as the strongest rotational motor described to date—the rotor of the bacterial ﬂagellum—gener - ates torques of 1 , 200 – 1 , 500 pN . nm . Finally , how does the membrane actually break ? At the edge of the constricted neck of dynamin , the membrane undergoes a dramatic change in curvature , resulting in local membrane stress at this location and a corresponding increase in elastic energy . Theelasticenergyaccumulationissufﬁcienttoreducetheenergy barrier to ﬁssion , which may ﬁnally result from simple Brownian ﬂuctuationsofthemembrane . Thestochasticityofﬁssionkinetics and the fact that ﬁssion occurs at the edge of the dynamin poly - mer support this mechanism ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) . Choreography toward Membrane Fission As described above , the order of endocytic protein recruitment to sequential stages of endocytic intermediates appears at least in part to be regulated by the spatiotemporal regulation of mem - brane composition and grossly to correspond to the curvature of the underlying membrane . As CCPs are metastable structures , the endocytic machinery needs to maintain a delicate balance between the generation and stabilization of curved membrane nanodomains and their destabilization as the structure moves forward toward ﬁssion ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) . A salient feature of the pathway appears be the fact that the curvature of each BAR domain protein sequentially added appears to follow an increasing curvature sequence en route to dynamin - mediated ﬁssion ( Figure 2 ) ( Mim and Unger , 2012 ; Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) . The F - BAR domains of FCHo proteins , which participate in CCP nucleation ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) , display a shallow curva - ture and can accommodate a corresponding membrane with a diameter of 110 – 130 nm ( Henne et al . , 2007 ) , much larger than the diameter of a ﬁnal clathrin - coated vesicle . Furthermore , these proteins lack an SH3 domain and the ability to associate with dynamin . As CCPs mature , BAR domain proteins of increasing curvature are recruited . These include FBP17 , with a curvature preference for a membrane sphere of 70 nm in diam - eter ( Shimada et al . , 2007 ) , substantially larger than FCHo and SNX9 , which can adopt two different conformations that yield different membrane curvatures ( Pylypenko et al . , 2007 ) , possibly facilitating constriction ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , amphiphysin and endophilin , N - BAR proteins with a preference for highly bent membranes of about 25 – 30 nm in diameter , are recruited ( Gallop et al . , 2006 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ) . The recruitment pattern of these latter BAR - SH3 domain proteins ( e . g . , SNX9 , amphiphysin , en - dophilin ) partially overlaps with that of dynamin ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , the sequential assembly of BAR domain proteins follows the progressive ingression of the endocytic vesicle neck , driven at least in part by the BAR domain proteins them - selves . Importantly , the sequential recruitment of BAR domain proteins will lead to the generation of an asymmetrically coated membrane tubule that reﬂects the time course of addition of the various BAR domain proteins to the maturing CCP . In this scenario , dynamin is ﬁnally added to the ‘‘tip’’ of the asymmetric BAR protein scaffold close to the coated vesicle , a model that is supported by super - resolution microscopy analysis of CCPs formed from plasma membrane sheets in vitro ( Wu et al . , 2010 ) . Apart from differential curvatures , the resulting BAR - dynamin protein assembly also displays asymmetry with respect to the number of amphipathic helices inserted into the underlying membrane . FCHo proteins lack bona ﬁde amphipathic helices ( Henne et al . , 2007 ) , indicating that their primary function in CME may be the stabilization of shallowly curved membrane domains . Amphiphysin and endophilin dimers , by contrast , har - bor two or four amphipathic helices ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ; Mim and Unger , 2012 ) , respectively , thereby poising the vesicle neck for ﬁssion by dynamin at the interface with the vesicle coat . Insertion of hydrophobic residues within the PH domain loops of dynamin ( Liu et al . , 2011 ; Ramachandran et al . , 2009 ) and from other endocytic proteins such as epsin ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ) may further aid the local membrane desta - bilization at the boundary between the coated vesicle and its neck . Thus , we anticipate that membrane ﬁssion will occur pref - erentially at the coat - to - neck boundary , in agreement with recent data from electron microscopy ( Sundborger et al . , 2011 ) . Another prediction derived from this model is that the location of the ﬁssion reaction is controlled by the sequential addition of BAR domain proteins , thereby determining the volume en - closed by the budding endocytic vesicle . Lack of individual en - docytic proteins , thus , would not only decrease the efﬁciency of endocytosis , but would also result in the generation of variably sized vesicles . Indeed , variations in the size of synaptic vesicles formed by CME have been observed at synapses from a variety of endocytic protein mutants ( Dittman and Ryan , 2009 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ) . A burning open question relates to the temporal regulation of ﬁssion . The above considerations suggest that BAR domain pro - teins indeed may fulﬁll dual roles in stabilizing curved membrane domains , thereby aiding constriction via the assembled BAR scaffold and promoting ﬁssion by amphipathic helix insertion , e . g . , in the case of endophilin . Further mechanisms , for example phosphorylation events that could modulate SH3 - PRD interac - tions with dynamin , may impose additional layers of regulation onto membrane ﬁssion in vivo . Future studies will need to address these possibilities in detail . Furthermore , principles similar to those described here for dynamin will likely apply to other ﬁssion reactions mediated by dynamin family members such as the ﬁssion of mitochondria ( Fro¨hlich et al . , 2013 ; Mears et al . , 2011 ) or chloroplasts ( Watanabe et al . , 2013b ) , though the dimensions of the organelles involved and the timescale of these reactions differ substantially from endocytic membrane ﬁssion .
