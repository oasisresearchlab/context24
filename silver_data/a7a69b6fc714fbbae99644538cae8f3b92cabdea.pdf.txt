Articles 244 | VOL . 12 NO . 3 | MARCH 2015 | nAture methods specific labeling of biomolecules with bright fluorophores is the keystone of fluorescence microscopy . Genetically encoded self - labeling tag proteins can be coupled to synthetic dyes inside living cells , resulting in brighter reporters than fluorescent proteins . intracellular labeling using these techniques requires cell - permeable fluorescent ligands , however , limiting utility to a small number of classic fluorophores . here we describe a simple structural modification that improves the brightness and photostability of dyes while preserving spectral properties and cell permeability . inspired by molecular modeling , we replaced the N , N - dimethylamino substituents in tetramethylrhodamine with four - membered azetidine rings . this addition of two carbon atoms doubles the quantum efficiency and improves the photon yield of the dye in applications ranging from in vitro single - molecule measurements to super - resolution imaging . the novel substitution is generalizable , yielding a palette of chemical dyes with improved quantum efficiencies that spans the uV and visible range . Fluorescence imaging of specific intracellular molecules requires precise labeling with bright , photostable fluorophores . Genetically encoded fluorophores ( GFP and variants ) excel with regard to their genetic specificity of labeling 1 but lack the requisite photostability for single - molecule microscopy and other photon - intensive imaging paradigms 2 . Over the past two decades , a number of alternative labeling strategies have been developed that combine the genetic specificity of fluorescent proteins with the favorable photophysics of small - molecule fluorophores . These include FlAsH 3 , enzyme - based ‘self - labeling tags’ ( for example , Snap - tag 4 and HaloTag 5 , 6 ) , electrophilic ligand – receptor pairs ( for example , trimethoprim ( TMP ) tag 7 and coumarin – photoactive yellow pro - tein ( PYP ) 8 ) and lipoic acid ligase variants 9 . In particular , the self - labeling tags have enabled advanced imaging experiments , such as super - resolution microscopy 7 , 10 , 11 and biomolecular tracking at single - molecule resolution 12 , 13 inside living cells . Although the general collection of chemical dyes is exten - sive 14 – 16 , relatively few exhibit the cell permeability needed for intracellular labeling . Thus , the available palette of intracellular A general method to improve fluorophores for live - cell and single - molecule microscopy Jonathan B Grimm 1 , Brian P English 1 , Jiji Chen 1 , Joel P Slaughter 1 , Zhengjian Zhang 1 , Andrey Revyakin 1 , 2 , Ronak Patel 1 , John J Macklin 1 , Davide Normanno 1 , 3 , Robert H Singer 1 , 4 , Timothée Lionnet 1 & Luke D Lavis 1 self - labeling tag ligands has been limited to classic , net - neutral fluorophores based on coumarin and rhodamine scaffolds 4 – 6 , 17 , 18 , which exhibit excellent membrane permeability and rapid labeling kinetics but suboptimal brightness and photostability . Previous campaigns to improve dye performance ( for example , Cy , Alexa Fluor ) , involved substantial modifications such as structural rigidification and addition of sulfonate groups 19 – 21 . These efforts resulted in highly polar , cell - impermeant dyes , useful in vitro 22 or on the cell exterior 23 but incompatible with live - cell intracellular applications . We sought , and now report , a general strategy to improve the brightness of fluorophores through a minimal structural change , thereby preserving cell permeability and efficiency of intracellular labeling . Using molecular modeling as a basis , we replaced the N , N - dimethyl group in the classic dye tetramethylrhodam - ine ( TMR ) with a four - membered azetidine ring . This minor alteration—a net addition of two carbon atoms—elicited a large increase in quantum yield relative to that of the parent fluoro - phore , enabling prolonged observations of single molecules in tracking experiments and localization microscopy with improved spatial resolution . We expanded this strategy to other fluoro - phores including the coumarin , naphthalimide , acridine , rhodol , carborhodamine , oxazine and Si - rhodamine classes , in which the straightforward replacement of N , N - dialkylamino groups with azetidines also increased quantum yield . This general method allowed for substantial improvements in fluorophore brightness while preserving the requisite small size and high membrane per - meability for use in live cells . resultsrational design of an improved tetraalkylrhodamine dye The simplest rhodamine fluorophore , rhodamine 110 ( 1 ; Fig . 1a ) , exhibits an absorption maximum in the blue ( λ max = 497 nm ) with a large extinction coefficient ( ε = 7 . 6 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) , emis - sion maximum in the green ( λ em = 520 nm ) and a high quantum yield ( φ = 0 . 88 ) ( ref . 24 ) . Alkylation of the rhodamine elicits a bathochromic shift in absorption and fluorescence emission wavelengths . For example , TMR ( 2 ) displayed λ max / λ em = 548 nm / 572 nm and ε = 7 . 8 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ( Fig . 1a ) .

Both of these dyes are used in commercial self - labeling tag substrates and can be used to label intracellular and extracellular proteins in living cells . A plausible explanation for the lower quantum efficiency of N , N , N ′ , N ′ - tetraalkylrhodamines such as 2 is the formation of a twisted internal charge transfer ( TICT ) state . In this process fluoro - phore 2 absorbs a photon to give an excited state ( 2 * ; Fig . 1b ) , which is followed by electron transfer from the nitrogen atom to the xanthene ring system with concomitant twisting of the C aryl - N bond ( 2 TICT ) . TICT is energetically favorable in tetraalkylrhodamine dyes owing to the lower ionization poten - tial of N , N - dialkylanilines versus less substituted anilines 25 . The TICT form relaxes without emission of a photon , leading to rapid nonradiative decay of the excited state 25 – 27 . The 2 TICT diradical intermediate may also undergo irreversible bleaching reactions 27 . Thus , rhodamine derivatives in which TICT is disfavored should exhibit increased quantum efficiency , longer fluorescence life - times and higher photostability . On the basis of this hypothesis , we reasoned that replacing the N , N - dimethyl group in TMR ( 2 ) with differently sized nitrogen - containing rings ( ranging from aziridine to azepane , compounds 3 – 7 ; Fig . 1a ) might mitigate TICT and improve fluorescence properties . Although previous work had shown the pyrrolidine - containing rhodamine 5 to have a higher fluorescence brightness than the piperidino - rhodamine 6 ( refs . 25 , 28 ) , azacyclic rhod - amines with smaller or larger ring sizes ( 3 , 4 and 7 ) had not been explored . From quantum mechanical calculations , we predicted that the novel azetidinyl rhodamine 4 would exhibit superior brightness to TMR ( 2 ) and the other alkylated rhodamines 3 , 5 , 6 and 7 ( Supplementary Note ) . To test this prediction we synthesized compounds 3 – 7 from fluorescein ( 8 ) using a palladium - catalyzed cross - coupling a b 300400500 600 700 800 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 2 abs 2 fl 4 abs 4 fl Wavelength ( nm ) N o r m a li z ed ab s & f l e � max ( nm ) � ( M – 1 cm – 1 ) � em ( nm ) � ( ns ) Dye � NR 2 78 , 000 548 572 2 . 21 2 0 . 41 – – – – 3 – 101 , 000 549 571 3 . 84 4 0 . 88 76 , 000 553 576 3 . 60 5 0 . 74 80 , 000 560 586 0 . 59 6 0 . 10 1 76 , 000 497 520 3 . 26 0 . 88 106 , 000 560 583 1 . 62 7 0 . 25 O CO 2 – NR 2 R 2 N + c n = 1 – 5 3 : n = 1 4 : n = 2 5 : n = 3 6 : n = 4 7 : n = 5 8 1 .

We then evalu - ated the photophysical properties of compounds 3 – 7 in aque - ous solution , comparing them to known rhodamines 1 and 2 ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Aziridine derivative 3 gave a colorless solution with no discernible fluorescence , a result sug - gesting that the ring strain in the aziridine substituents forces the rhodamine molecule to adopt a colorless , nonfluorescent lactone form . Compounds 4 – 7 had λ max and λ em values similar to those of TMR ( 2 ) , with increased ring size causing a slight bathochro - mic shift of up to 10 nm . Compounds 4 and 7 had ε values ~ 30 % higher than those of the other dyes ; values of this magnitude have been observed with tetraethylrhodamine 15 , 28 . Although the λ max , λ em , and ε of the different rhodamine dyes showed only modest dependence on substituent ring size , the fluorescence lifetime ( τ ) and φ varied widely as a function of molecular structure ( Fig . 1a ) . Rhodamine 4 exhibited a high quantum yield value ( φ = 0 . 88 ) and long fluorescence lifetime ( τ = 3 . 8 ns ) , larger than the values for TMR ( 2 ; φ = 0 . 41 , τ = 2 . 2 ns ) and similar to the parent rhodamine 110 ( 1 ; φ = 0 . 88 , τ = 3 . 3 ns ) . Rhodamine 4 was also 60 % brighter ( ε × φ ) than the pyrrolidine derivative 5 , which had φ = 0 . 74 and τ = 3 . 6 ns . The piperidine deriv - ative 6 showed a sharp decrease in fluorescence with φ = 0 . 10 and τ = 0 . 6 ns ; the lifetime values for 5 and 6 were consistent with those measured for similar fluorophores 25 . Rhodamine 7 gave slightly higher values of φ = 0 . 25 and τ = 1 . 62 ns relative to 6 , suggesting that the increased flexibility of this larger ring can offset the other deleterious structural effects on rhodamine fluorescence . The improved brightness of rhodamine 4 under one - photon excitation ( Fig . 1a ) extended to two - photon excitation ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . This enhancement is brought about by a negligible structural change—the addition of two carbon atoms—that preserves many of the desirable properties of TMR . For example , the absorption and emission spectra of 2 and 4 are superimposable ( Fig . 1e ) , and the dyes show comparable sensitiv - ity to solvent polarity ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) , which suggests similar cell permeability 18 , 24 . Because of its high brightness , favo - rable chemical properties and λ max = 549 nm , azetidinyl rhodam - ine 4 was named JF 549 ( Janelia Fluor 549 ) . utility of JF 549 in cellular imaging To evaluate the performance of the dye as a label , we syn - thesized JF 549 HaloTag ligand ( 9 ; Fig . 1f ) starting from a 6 - carboxyfluorescein derivative ( Supplementary Note ) . This molecule is a direct analog of the commercial TMR - based HaloTag ligand 10 . We compared the labeling kinetics of compounds 9 and 10 with a novel Cy3 HaloTag ligand and measured the brightness and photon yield of the resulting conjugates . The JF 549 ligand ( 9 ) showed labeling kinetics comparable to those of the TMR ligand ( 10 ) and increased brightness relative to that of the other dyes in vitro ( Supplementary Note ) . Incubation of live HeLa cells expressing a HaloTag – histone 2B ( H2B ) fusion with compound 9 resulted in bright nuclear labeling ( Fig . 1g ) and low cytoplasmic background , thereby demonstrating that the JF 549 HaloTag ligand can efficiently cross the membrane of live cells and selectively label the HaloTag protein . Incubation with low amounts of ligand 9 or 10 ( < 50 nM ) allowed imaging of single molecules ( Supplementary Video 1 ) and evaluation of fluorophore brightness ( photons / s ) and photostability ( i . e . , track length ) of individual molecules of labeled HaloTag - H2B . The JF 549 ligand 9 demonstrated a large increase in both brightness and photostability compared to those of TMR ligand 10 ( Fig . 1h ) . Proteins labeled with 10 exhibited a mean value of 1 . 1 × 10 4 photons / s and a mean track length of 0 . 72 s . Conjugates of JF 549 ligand 9 emitted nearly twice the number of photons per second ( 1 . 9 × 10 4 ) and lasted about twice as long ( mean track length = 1 . 6 s ) . This improvement in single - molecule brightness extended to direct stochastic optical recon - struction microscopy ( dSTORM ) experiments , in which the use of a reducing environment enables the reversible photoswitching of synthetic fluorophores 7 , 29 – 31 . We labeled U2OS cells expressing HaloTag - H2B with JF 549 ligand 9 or TMR ligand 10 . We then fixed the cells and imaged them using standard dSTORM conditions . This resulted in a super - resolution image of H2B using ligand 9 or molecule 10 with median localization errors ( σ ) of 14 . 1 nm and 17 . 0 nm , respectively ( Fig . 1i and Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . We could also perform dSTORM inside living cells using the cellular reducing environment to elicit photoswitching of the JF 549 label 7 ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . Together , our results establish JF 549 as the best available ligand in this spectral range for HaloTag conju - gation in vitro , in fixed cells and in live cells , thus validating our fluorophore design strategy . extension of the azetidine strategy to other dye scaffolds After observing the improved brightness with the rhodamine scaffold , we sought to replace N , N - dialkyl groups found in other fluorophores with azetidines . The N , N - dialkyl motif is found in numerous classic fluorophore scaffolds 14 ( Table 1 ) , including coumarins ( for example , 11 , coumarin 461 ) , naphthalimides , acridines ( for example , 17 , acridine orange ) , rhodols , car - borhodamines 24 , oxazines ( for example , 23 , oxazine 1 ) and Si - rhodamines 18 , 32 . TICT has been proposed as a major contribu - tor to nonradiative decay in these fluorescence systems , leading to modest quantum efficiencies 26 . As with the rhodamine case , we used an efficient palladium - catalyzed cross - coupling approach to install the azetidine motif in these fluorophores , starting from accessible aryl halides or aryl triflates ( Supplementary Note ) . In all cases the azetidine substitution imparted large increases in quantum yield without substantial deleterious effects on other spectral properties ( Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Coumarin 461 ( 11 ) exhibited λ max / λ em = 372 nm / 470 nm , ε = 1 . 8 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 and a modest φ = 0 . 19 in aqueous buffer . The analog 12 showed a fivefold increase in quantum yield ( φ = 0 . 96 ) along with an 18 - nm hypsochromic shift in absorbance maxima ( λ max = 354 nm ) . The emission spectrum and extinc - tion coefficients of 12 ( λ max = 467 nm , ε = 1 . 5 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) were similar to those of the parent dye 11 . The widely used 7 - ( diethylamino ) coumarin - 3 - carboxylic acid ( DEAC , 13 ) dis - played λ max / λ em = 410 nm / 471 nm and ε = 3 . 5 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 but a low quantum yield ( φ = 0 . 03 ) . The azetidinyl analog 14 had a shorter absorption maximum ( λ max = 387 nm ) and a smaller extinction coefficient ( ε = 2 . 4 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) . Nonetheless , the emission maxima proved quite similar with λ em = 470 nm , and the azetidine substitution increased the quantum yield by almost 30 - fold ( φ = 0 . 84 ) . We then considered the naphthalimide , acridine and rhodol fluorophore scaffolds . Dimethylamino - substituted naphthalimides such as compound 15 are important environmentally sensitive n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

We prepared the azetidinyl analog 16 , which showed a bathochromic shift in absorbance maximum ( λ max = 464 nm ) , a larger extinction coefficient ( ε = 1 . 8 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) and a high quantum yield ( φ = 0 . 28 , λ em = 553 nm ) . The classic fluorophore acridine orange ( 17 ) gave φ = 0 . 21 when measured in aqueous solution , a value consistent with published data 34 . The azetidine analog 18 was 2 . 5 - fold brighter with φ = 0 . 52 . Other spectral properties of the two acridines were similar . Rhodol ( 19 ) had λ max / λ em = 518 nm / 546 nm , and ε = 6 . 0 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 and φ = 0 . 21 , consistent with previous results 35 . The azetidine - containing analog 20 had nearly indistinguishable λ max , λ em and ε values . However , the replace - ment of the N , N - dimethylamino group in 19 with an azetidine in 20 gave a fourfold increase in quantum yield ( φ = 0 . 85 ) . We then turned to longer - wavelength fluorophores . The carbon - containing analog of TMR ( 21 ) exhibited λ max / λ em = 606 nm / 626 nm , ε = 1 . 21 × 10 5 M −1 cm −1 and φ = 0 . 52 in aqueous buffer ( Table 1 ) . The azetidinyl carborhodamine 22 had similar absorption and emission maxima ( λ max / λ em = 608 nm / 631 nm ) and extinc - tion coefficient ( ε = 9 . 9 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) but a higher quantum yield ( φ = 0 . 67 ) . The classic dye oxazine 1 ( 23 ) had spectral properties in the far red with λ max / λ em = 655 nm / 669 nm and ε = 1 . 11 × 10 5 M −1 cm −1 but a relatively low φ = 0 . 07 . The aze - tidine substitution in dye 24 gave a small hypsochromic shift ( λ max / λ em = 647 nm / 661 nm ) , a slightly lower extinc - tion coefficient ( ε = 9 . 9 × 10 4 M −1 cm −1 ) and a 3 . 4 - fold improvement in quantum yield ( φ = 0 . 24 ) . Finally , the recently described silicon - containing TMR 18 , 32 ( SiTMR , 25 ) had λ max / λ em = 643 nm / 662 nm and φ = 0 . 41 ; the azetidinyl analog 26 gave similar absorption and emission maxima ( λ max / λ em = 646 nm / 664 nm ) and a higher φ = 0 . 54 . Because Si - rhodamines often adopt a colorless form in water 18 , 32 , we measured the extinction coef - ficients in acidic ethanol , finding ε = 1 . 41 × 10 5 M −1 cm −1 for SiTMR ( 25 ) and ε = 1 . 52 × 10 5 M −1 cm −1 for azetidine 26 . Overall , these results demonstrate that the azetidinyl substitution is generalizable to different fluorophore scaffolds , produc - ing substantial improvements in quantum yield values . cellular imaging using azetidinyl si - rhodamine Compounds based on SiTMR ( 25 ) were previously reported to be efficient labels for Snap - tag , HaloTag and other proteins inside live cells 18 , 32 . Compound 26 had superior brightness ( ε × φ ; Table 1 ) relative to that of 25 and was named JF 646 ( Janelia Fluor 646 ) . To compare these two dyes directly in cellular imaging experiments , we synthesized the HaloTag ligand of the azetidinyl Si - rhodamine ( 27 ; Fig . 2a ) and the known 18 HaloTag ligand of SiTMR ( 28 ) , starting from a novel silafluorescein precursor ( Supplementary Note ) . Both Si - rhodamine ligands 27 and 28 were excellent labels for super - resolution dSTORM imaging of HaloTag - H2B in U2OS cells ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) , showing median localization errors of 8 . 4 nm and 9 . 0 nm , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . We also performed dSTORM on live HeLa cells expressing HaloTag - tubulin and labeled with JF 646 ligand 27 . We observed high photon yields and low background with this label , giving a median σ = 7 . 1 nm ( Supplementary Fig . 4c – e ) . table 1 | Spectroscopic data for fluorophores 11 – 26 Parent structure substitution l max ( nm ) « ( m −1 cm −1 ) l em ( nm ) f O R 2 N O CH 3 11 : R 2 N = N 372 18 , 000 470 0 . 19 12 : R 2 N = N 354 15 , 000 467 0 . 96 O R 2 N O CO 2 H 13 : R 2 N = N 410 35 , 000 471 0 . 03 14 : R 2 N = N 387 24 , 000 470 0 . 84 R 2 N N O O CO 2 H 15 : R 2 N = N 436 9 , 500 – < 0 . 01 16 : R 2 N = N 464 18 , 000 553 0 . 28 N NR 2 R 2 N 17 : R 2 N = N 493 50 , 000 528 0 . 21 18 : R 2 N = N 492 47 , 000 531 0 . 52 O CO 2 H O R 2 N 19 : R 2 N = N 518 60 , 000 546 0 . 21 20 : R 2 N = N 519 59 , 000 546 0 . 85 CO 2 – NR 2 R 2 N + 21 : R 2 N = N 606 121 , 000 626 0 . 52 22 : R 2 N = N 608 99 , 000 631 0 . 67 N O NR 2 R 2 N + 23 : R 2 N = N 655 111 , 000 669 0 . 07 24 : R 2 N = N 647 99 , 000 661 0 . 24 Si CO 2 – NR 2 R 2 N + 25 : R 2 N = N 643 141 , 000 a 662 0 . 41 26 : R 2 N = N 646 152 , 000 a 664 0 . 54 a Extinction coefficient measured in ethanol containing 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) trifluoroacetic acid . λ max , absorption maximum ; ε , extinction coefficient ; λ em , emission maximum ; φ , quantum yield . n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

However , conjugation to a protein changes the local environment around the dye , eliciting a large increase in absorbance 18 , 32 . We compared the chromogenicity of ligands 27 and 28 upon reac - tion with purified protein and in live - cell imaging experiments . The SiTMR ligand 28 showed an enhancement of 6 . 8 - fold upon reaction with excess HaloTag protein in buffer ( Fig . 2c ) , a result consistent with previous reports 18 . The azetidinyl Si - rhodamine – HaloTag ligand 27 had lower background , leading to a larger , 21 - fold increase in absorbance under the same conditions ( Fig . 2d ) . We then performed ‘no - wash’ imaging experiments using HeLa cells expressing the HaloTag - H2B fusion . Incubation with either ligand ( 100 nM ) followed directly by wide - field imaging gave brightly labeled nuclei using both the SiTMR ligand 28 and the JF 646 ligand 27 ( Fig . 2e , f ) . However , SiTMR showed substantial extranuclear fluorescence , whereas the JF 646 ligand exhibited lower nonspecific staining ( Fig . 2g , h and Supplementary Fig . 4f ) . Overall , these results show that the known SiTMR ligand 28 can be replaced with the structurally similar JF 646 ligand 27 to achieve better localization error in super - resolution imaging and lower background in conventional fluorescence microscopy . The excellent properties of JF 549 and JF 646 and the large spectral separation between the two fluorophores raised the possibility of imaging two distinct protein species at the single - molecule level in the same living cell . To achieve orthogonal labeling , we prepared the Snap - tag ligand of JF 549 ( 29 ; Fig . 2i and Supplementary Note ) . We coexpressed HaloTag - H2B and a fusion of the Snap - tag enzyme and the Tet repressor protein ( Snap - tag – TetR ) in U2OS cells and labeled the HaloTag - H2B with JF 646 ligand 27 and the Snap - tag – TetR with JF 549 ligand 29 . We imaged the trajectories of individual JF 549 - labeled TetR proteins and then performed a rapid live - cell dSTORM experi - ment of the JF 646 - H2B conjugate ( Supplementary Fig . 4g and Supplementary Video 2 ) . This proof - of - concept , two - color experiment revealed the respective partitions of fast - and slow - diffusing DNA - binding protein in relation to the chromatin structure of the nucleus ( Fig . 2j ) and showed that TetR diffusion is slower in H2B - dense regions ( Supplementary Fig . 4h ) , which is consistent with previous observations that inert tracers diffuse more slowly in dense chromatin regions 36 . cellular imaging using an azetidinyl coumarin label The improvements to coumarin 13 brought about by the azeti - dine substitution were also interesting , as derivatives of this cell - permeable dye can be used for intracellular labeling . We compared the performance of a commercial Snap - tag ligand 30 ( i . e . , Snap - Cell 430 ; Fig . 3a ) to that of novel azetidinyl derivative 31 , which we synthesized from coumarin 14 ( Supplementary Note ) . Under identical transient transfection , labeling and imaging conditions , H2B - Snap - tag – expressing HeLa cells were stained with the red fluorescent nuclear stain DRAQ5 and either known ligand 30 or azetidinyl ligand 31 . Using the DRAQ5 staining as a spatial refer - ence ( Fig . 3b , c ) , we measured the intensity of individual nuclei labeled by either Snap - tag ligand . Cells incubated with ligand 30 had low fluorescence intensity , whereas cells labeled with 31 exhibited brighter nuclear labeling ( Fig . 3d , e ) . Quantification of nuclear intensity showed that the cells labeled with azetidine 31 had median values that were fivefold higher than those of cells labeled with the commercial compound 30 ( Fig . 3f ) . b Si CO 2 – NR 2 R 2 N HN O O O Cl + N N 27 : NR 2 = 28 : NR 2 = a c 400 500600700800 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 Wavelength ( nm ) A b s o r ban c e – HT + HT 6 . 8 - fold e 1284 × 10 3 1284 × 10 3 f Line length ( µ m ) Nucleus 12108642 I n t en s i t y ( × 10 3 a . u . ) 40 30 20 10 0 g h Nucleus 12108642 I n t en s i t y ( × 10 3 a . u . ) 40 30 20 10 0 Line length ( µ m ) d 400 500600700800 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 A b s o r ban c e Wavelength ( nm ) – HT + HT 21 - fold D app ( µ m 2 s – 1 ) 8 6 4 2 0 j i O C O 2 – N + N HN O O N N N NH NH 2 29 Figure 2 | Utility of JF 646 in cellular imaging .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nAture methods | VOL . 12 NO . 3 | MARCH 2015 | 249 Articles discussion We report a simple structural modification—the replacement of N , N - dialkyl groups with azetidines—that improves the quantum efficiency of classic fluorophores with absorbance maxima from the UV to the far red . In particular , the azetidine substitution endows JF 549 and JF 646 with superior brightness while retain - ing excellent cell penetration and fast labeling kinetics with the HaloTag . These novel dyes should facilitate new microscopic experiments such as multiplexed single - molecule measurements at a high spatiotemporal resolution inside living cells ( for exam - ple , Fig . 2j ) . Such experiments will constitute a major tool in testing models relating molecular architecture and biological dynamics 36 , 37 . In addition to serving as ligands for self - labeling tags , many classic fluorophores are components of fluorescent labels , stains and indicators 14 , 15 , 21 . Replacement of the dialkylamino groups in these molecules with azetidines could yield a new generation of probes with improved properties . For example , derivatives of the bright coumarin fluorophores 12 and 14 could find use in other protein - based labeling schemes 8 , 9 or as non - natural amino acids 38 , where the size of the fluorophore label is restricted by the biochemical machinery . This general approach to attenuate nonradiative decay sets the stage for combinatorial enhancements via other structural modifications , such as halo - genation 39 or attachment of triplet - state quenchers 40 , to further improve brightness and photostability , altogether pushing the limits of biological imaging . methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper .

Methods for molecular modeling , organic synthesis and additional characterization can be found in the Supplementary Note . General spectroscopic methods . Fluorescent and fluorogenic molecules for spectroscopy were prepared as stock solutions in DMSO and diluted such that the DMSO concentration did not exceed 1 % ( v / v ) . Phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) was at pH 7 . 4 unless otherwise noted . Commercial compounds for spectros - copy were of the highest quality available and obtained from the following sources : Anaspec ( 2 ) ; Promega ( 10 ) ; Sigma - Aldrich ( 11 , 13 ) ; Life Technologies ( 17 ) ; AAT Bioquest ( 23 ) ; New England BioLabs ( 30 ) . UV - Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy . Spectroscopy was per - formed using 1 - cm path length , 3 . 5 - mL quartz cuvettes from Starna Cells or 1 - cm path length , 1 . 0 - mL quartz microcuvettes from Hellma . All measurements were taken at ambient temperature ( 22 ± 2 °C ) in 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 , buffer unless otherwise noted . Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary Model 100 spectrom - eter ( Varian ) ; reported values for extinction coefficients at λ max ( ε ) are averages ( n = 3 ) . Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Cary Eclipse fluorometer ( Varian ) . Normalized spectra are shown for clarity . Quantum yield determination . All reported quantum yield values were measured in our laboratory under identical conditions using a Quantaurus - QY spectrometer ( C11374 , Hamamatsu ) . This instrument uses an integrating sphere to determine photons absorbed and emitted by a sample . Measurements were carried out using dilute samples ( A < 0 . 1 ) , and self - absorption correc - tions 41 were performed using the instrument software . Reported values are averages ( n = 3 ) . Dioxane - H 2 O titration . Dioxane - H 2 O titrations were performed in spectral - grade dioxane ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and milliQ H 2 O . The solvent mixtures contained 0 . 01 % ( v / v ) triethylamine to ensure the rhodamine dyes were in the zwitterionic form . The absorb - ance values at λ max were measured on 5 µ M samples ( n = 2 ) using a quartz 96 - well microplate ( Hellma ) and a FlexStation3 micro - plate reader ( Molecular Devices ) . Values of dielectric constant ( ε r ) were as reported 42 . Multiphoton spectroscopy . The two - photon measurements were performed as previously described 43 , 44 . Measurements were taken on an inverted microscope ( IX81 , Olympus ) equipped with a 60× , 1 . 2 - NA ( numerical aperture ) water objective ( Olympus ) . Dye samples were excited with pulses from an 80 - MHz Ti - sapphire laser ( Chameleon Ultra II , Coherent ) . Fluorescence collected by the objective was passed through a shortpass filter ( 720SP , Semrock ) and a bandpass filter ( 550BP200 , Semrock ) , and detected by a fiber - coupled Avalanche Photodiode ( APD ) . Two different APDs were used , one optimized for low noise for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) and spectral mea - surements ( SPCM _ AQRH - 14 , PerkinElmer ) and the other for precise timing for lifetime measurements ( PDF - CCTB , Micro Photon Devices ) . The focused laser spot size was measured to be 0 . 420 µ m ( radius where intensity drops to 1 / e 2 ) . Two - photon excitation spectra were taken on samples of 1 µ M dye in HEPES buffer , using 1 mW of laser power at the sample across the spec - tral range of 710 – 1 , 080 nm . The peak molecular brightness , defined as the maximum detected count rate per emitting mol - ecule , was obtained by determining the fluorescence count rate and the average number of emitting molecules in the beam using FCS 43 . For FCS measurements , a stock dye solution was diluted to 50 nM in 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 2 , and excited at discrete laser powers ranging from 5 to 30 mW , with FCS data acquisition for each power setting taken for 100 – 200 s . The samples were excited at 830 - nm and 1 , 020 - nm laser wavelength ( the absorption peaks obtained from two photon excitation spectra ) . The fluorescence signal detected by the APD at each wavelength and power set - ting was fed to the autocorrelator ( Flex03LQ , Correlator . com ) , and a computer program recorded the autocorrelation function and average fluorescence counts per second , defined as < F > . The measured autocorrelation curve was fit to an FCS diffusion model with a Matlab program using a customized code ( available upon request ) , to determine the average number of excited mol - ecules < N > in the volume of excitation . The molecular bright - ness ( < ε p > ) was thus obtained as the rate of fluorescence per excited molecule defined as < ε p > = < F > / < N > ( ref . 43 ) . Increasing the laser intensity initially increases the molecular brightness ; however , at a certain point molecular brightness leveled off or started decreasing , indicating photobleaching or saturation of the molecule in the excitation volume . The maximum or peak brightness achieved before photobleaching or saturation repre - sents the useful proxy for the photostability of a fluorophore . Fluorescence - lifetime spectroscopy . For fluorescence - lifetime measurements , a pulse picker ( Model 350 - 160 , ConOptics ) was placed in the laser beam to reduce the pulse frequency from 80 MHz to 20 MHz . Samples ( 2 µ M dye diluted in 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 2 , H 2 O , or CH 3 OH ) were excited at 830 - nm laser wave - length and 6 - mW laser power . The emitted light was collected by the fast - timing APD and fed to the single - photon counting board ( TimeHarp200 , PicoQuant ) . Timing pulses were obtained from a PIN diode ( DET01CFC , Thorlabs ) monitoring the 20 - MHz pulse train . The temporal impulse response of the system was deter - mined by second harmonic generation of laser pulses using a thin nonlinear crystal in place of a dye sample . The lifetime decay data were fit to a single exponential decay function using a custom Matlab program ( available upon request ) . Lifetime value of the reference fluorescein dye measured using our system was 4 . 025 ± 0 . 015 ns ( mean ± s . d . , n = 2 ) compared to a literature value of 4 . 1 ± 0 . 1 ns ( ref . 45 ) . Measurement of increase in fluorescence of HaloTag ligands 27 and 28 upon reaction with HaloTag protein . Absorbance measurements were performed in 1 - mL quartz cuvettes . HaloTag protein was used as a 100 µ M solution in 75 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 4 , with 50 % ( v / v ) glycerol ( TBS - glycerol ) . HaloTag ligands 27 and 28 ( 5 µ M ) were dissolved in 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 3 , containing 0 . 1 mg mL −1 CHAPS . An aliquot of HaloTag protein ( 1 . 5 equiv ) or an equivalent volume of TBS - glycerol blank was added , and the resulting mixture was incubated until consistent absorbance signal was observed ( ~ 30 min ) . Additional HaloTag protein did not elicit an increase in absorbance ( not shown ) . Absorbance scans are averages ( n = 2 ) . n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3256 nAture methods Cell culture , transfection and labeling . HeLa cells ( ATCC ) and U2OS cells ( ATCC ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ; Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Life Technologies ) , 1 mM GlutaMAX ( Life Technologies ) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Sigma ) , and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % ( v / v ) CO 2 environment . These cell lines undergo regular mycoplasma test - ing by the Janelia Cell Culture Facility . Cells were transfected with HaloTag - H2B , HaloTag - tubulin , Snap - tag – TetR or Snap - tag – H2B using an Amaxa Nucleofector ( Lonza ) . Before the imaging experiments , transfected cells were transferred onto a no . 1 coverslip ( Warner Instruments ) that was cleaned by Piranha solution ( 3 : 1 ( v / v ) mixture of concentrated H 2 SO 4 and 30 % ( v / v ) hydrogen peroxide ) . To label live cells with the HaloTag or Snap - tag ligands , we added compounds 9 , 10 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , or 31 to the growth medium , and the samples were incubated for 15 min . Labeling concentrations were typically 100 – 500 nM for confocal , wide - field , and dSTORM experiments and 5 – 50 nM for single - molecule tracking experiments . Cells were then washed briefly with PBS ( 1× ) and then incubated in DMEM - FBS for an addi - tional 15 min . Before imaging , the cells were washed briefly with PBS ( 3× ) and placed in fresh DMEM - FBS for imaging . All washes were omitted in the ‘no wash’ experiments . For nuclear staining , cells were incubated in PBS for 5 min ( 2× ) and then in PBS con - taining 5 µ M DRAQ5 ( Cell Signaling ) for 5 min , followed by a brief wash with PBS ( 1× ) . During all imaging experiments , cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO 2 environment supplied by a live - cell incubator ( Tokai Hit ) . Microscopy hardware . Three separate systems were used to acquire microscopic images . Confocal microscopy was per - formed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope with an LD C - Apochromat 40× , 1 . 2 W Korr M27 UV - VIS - IR objec - tive . Wide - field microscopy , 2D single - molecule tracking and super - resolution imaging experiments were conducted on a Nikon Eclipse Ti wide - field epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100× , 1 . 4 - NA oil - immersion objective lens ( Nikon ) , a Lumencor light source , a set of lasers ( 405 nm / 100 mW , Coherent Cube ; 561 nm / 200 mW , Cobolt Jive ; 633 nm / 140 mW , Vortran Stradus ) , controlled by an Acousto - Optic Tunable Filter ( AA Opto - Electronic ) , two filter wheels ( Lambda 10 - 3 , Sutter Instruments ) , a perfect focusing system ( Nikon ) and an EMCCD ( electron - multiplying charge - couple device ) camera ( iXon3 , Andor ) . Emission filters ( FF01 593 / 40 or FF01 676 / 37 , Semrock ) were placed in front of the cameras for JF 549 and JF 646 emission . A multiband mirror ( 405 / 488 / 561 / 633 BrightLine quad - band bandpass filter , Semrock ) was used to reflect the excitation laser beams into the objective . The microscope , cameras and hardware were controlled through the NIS - Elements software ( Nikon ) . Other live - cell single super - resolution imaging experiments were recorded on a custom - built three - camera RAMM frame ( ASI ) microscope using an 1 . 4 - NA PLAPON 60× OSC objective ( Olympus ) , and a 300 - mm focal length tube lens ( LAO - 300 . 0 , Melles Griot ) , resulting in 100× over - all magnification . Stroboscopic 405 - nm excitation of the Stradus 405 - 100 laser ( Vortran ) was achieved using a NI - DAQ - USB - 6363 acquisition board ( National Instruments ) , which also controlled the 637 - nm laser emission from a Stradus 637 - 140 laser ( Vortran ) . A 2 - mm - thick quad - band dichroic ( ZT 405 / 488 / 561 / 640rpx , Chroma ) , and a bandpass emission filter ( FF01 - 731 / 137 - 25 , Semrock ) filtered the emitted light . Fluorescence was detected with a back - illuminated EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology , Ixon Ultra DU - 897U - CS0 - EXF , 17 - MHz EM amplifier ) , which was controlled through µ Manager ( v . 1 . 4 . 17 ) . dSTORM imaging . Super - resolution imaging experiments were performed on live samples ( Fig . 2j and Supplementary Figs . 2c and 4d , g ) and fixed cells ( Figs . 1i and 2b and Supplementary Figs . 2a and 4a ) . For live - cell dSTORM imaging the cells were labeled , washed and imaged directly in DMEM - FBS . For fixed - cell prepa - rations , cells were labeled , washed and fixed in 4 % paraformalde - hyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS buffer ( pH 7 . 5 ) . The cells were imaged in a sealed cell chamber ( Life Technologies ) con - taining nitrogen - degassed redox buffer consisting of PBS supple - mented with 50 mM mercaptoethylamine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 10 % ( w / v ) glucose , 0 . 5 mg mL −1 glucose oxidase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 28 , 400 U mL −1 catalase ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Before imaging , JF 549 could be efficiently ‘shelved’ in a dark state upon illumination with 2 kW cm −2 of excitation light ( 561 nm ) and then activated back to a fluorescent state by blue light ( 405 nm ) with low intensity ( ~ 20 W cm −2 ) . JF 646 fluorophores were converted into a pre - dominately dark state using continuous illumination of 637 - nm excitation light at 14 kW cm −2 , after which individual rapidly blinking molecules of JF 646 fluorophores were observed . These experiments were conducted on the two wide - field microscope systems described above : the Nikon Eclipse Ti epifluorescence microscope ( Figs . 1i and 2j and Supplementary Figs . 2a , c and 4g ) and the custom - built three - camera microscope with an ASI RAMM frame ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 4a , d ) . dSTORM analysis . The spot localization ( x , y ) was obtained on the basis of the multiple - target tracing ( MTT ) algorithm 46 , 47 using a custom Matlab program ( available upon request ) . For each frame , the point spread function ( PSF ) of individual fluorophores was fitted into 2D Gaussian distribution . Integrated fluorescence intensities were calculated and converted to photon counts using analysis routines written in Igor Pro version 6 . 34A ( available upon request ) . Localization errors were calculated using equation ( 6 ) in Mortensen et al . 48 . Super - resolution images were rendered using the software package Localizer by Dedecker et al . 49 run - ning from Igor Pro v . 3 . 34A , which superimposes the position coordinates of detected spots as Gaussian masks using the fitted intensity values as amplitudes and the localization errors as the widths . The dSTORM data for experiments comparing two different fluorophore ligands were recorded on the same day under identical illumination conditions . Two - color single - molecule experiments . The two - color single - molecule experiments were recorded on the Nikon Eclipse Ti wide - field epifluorescence microscope . We first performed a 2D single - molecule tracking of Snap - tag – TetR – JF 549 using a 561 - nm laser of excitation intensity ~ 1 kW cm −2 at a frame rate of 100 Hz . Immediately after the completion of the single - particle track - ing experiment , we then imaged HaloTag - H2B - JF 646 under the dSTORM mode as described above . Transmission images were taken before and after the tracking dSTORM experiments , and a cross - correlation algorithm was employed to calculate the image drift 50 . Tracking analysis of TetR was performed using the com - mercial tracking software DiaTrack ( v . 3 . 03 , Semasopht ) , which n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 3256 nAture methods identifies and fits the intensity spots of fluorescent particles with 2D Gaussian functions matched to the experimentally determined PSF . The diffusion map was created using tracking routines writ - ten in Igor Pro 6 . 34A , calculating the local apparent diffusion of TetR mobility evaluated on a 20 nm × 20 nm xy grid from the mean square displacements over a timescale of 10 ms ( Fig . 2j ; code is available upon request ) . Whenever two or more separate displacements originating within 80 nm of a given grid node were found , a local apparent diffusion coefficient was calculated and plotted . We then selected H2B clusters as the 500 brightest spots in the super - resolved image . From this analysis , we generated a histogram of apparent diffusion coefficients for all trajectories that dwelled within 320 nm of a H2B cluster for at least 10 ms . We then plotted histograms of the diffusion coefficient of both the H2B - colocalized and the noncolocalized TetR trajectories ( Supplementary Fig . 4h ) . 42 . Critchfield , F . E . , Gibson , J .
