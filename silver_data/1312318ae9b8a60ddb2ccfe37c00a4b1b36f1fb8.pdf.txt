In this paper , we call for a holistic view when designing support mechanisms , such as interaction paradigms , interfaces , and systems , for these multifaceted workflows . 1 Introduction Human - centered AI ( HCAI ) research focuses on various aspects : analyzing practitioners’ work practices along dimensions such as collaboration [ 5 , 27 ] , explainability [ 19 ] , and trust [ 13 ] ; conceptu - alizing specific workflows to inform design guidelines [ 16 , 22 , 10 , 12 , 15 ] ; and developing supporting tools and frameworks [ 18 , 26 , 1 ] . HCAI workflows are multi - faceted , wherein stakeholders with different roles — e . g . , product managers , subject matter experts , and data scientists — perform diverse tasks in various phases using different tools . Multiple roles introduce challenges related to collaboration among stakeholders and interaction with tools . The iterative workflows necessitate fine - grained provenance management [ 18 ] . The scope and diversity of domains ( e . g . , NLP , ML , Vision ) introduce challenges related to the modeling of domain semantics . To this end , we propose a holistic design that employs plastic interfaces to enable seamless interactions , integrated workflows for ease of task completion , and a graph - based system for managing workflows and provenance . Figure 1 : Multifaceted Human - centered AI ( M - HCAI ) conceptual diagram . 2 M - HCAI Challenges Figure 1 depicts the conceptual diagram of M - HCAI with various workflow components and system requirements . A workflow is iterative with transitions among phases ( a ) . However , a fine - grained characterization , proposed by Rahman et al . [ 16 ] , reveals the iterative nature of a phase with stake - holders performing diverse tasks ( c ) . Stakeholders may interact with different tools and interfaces depending on their task requirement , familiarity , and expertise ( d ) [ 18 , 25 ] . Stakeholders with differ - ent roles collaborate in various phases within the workflow both synchronously ( in - person and virtual meetings ) and asynchronously ( e . g . , Email , Slack , Google Docs ) [ 16 , 17 , 27 ] . Preprint . Under review . Such complexity of an MHCAI workflow introduces several challenges . First , iteration : iterative workflows often force the users to switch multiple tools tediously , often within a single phase [ 16 , 18 , 2 ] . Second , interface rigidity : existing tools lack the plasticity to accommodate diverse roles and expertise as stakeholders ideate and deliberate [ 4 , 13 ] . Third , non - standardized collaboration : as stakeholders collaborate , there may be conflict and misunderstanding [ 23 , 24 ] . However , there is a lack of standardization around documentation to record these discussions [ 9 , 27 , 17 ] . Finally , domain diversity : when we factor in diverse domains within the HCAI setting such as text [ 18 , 3 ] , image , graphs , and tables [ 14 ] , the lack of formal abstractions and grammar makes it difficult to define and instrument operations in the interfaces systematically . One aspect lacking from the HCAI discourse is the management of complicated workflows , which necessitate robust system design . Zhang et al . [ 27 ] identified lack of provenance as a contributing factor in obfuscation and loss of knowledge when data science teams share data . Rahman et al . [ 16 ] advocate for instrumenting provenance management mechanisms as built - in features of systems . Kandogan et al . [ 6 ] highlight how existing systems fail to connect and exploit context across stakeholders and agents due to a lack of initiative in modeling data , people , and interactions . 3 Multifaceted Human - centered AI : A Holistic View We posit that the workflow - and system - level challenges mentioned in Section 2 are interdependent . Capturing the provenance of interactions and decisions within the workflow requires provenance - aware interfaces with built - in logging capabilities . For the underlying system to effectively persist and catalog the provenance information , the interactions defined on the interfaces need grounding on sound principles . Such principled design requires ( a ) building abstractions to capture domain semantics ( e . g . , texts contain words , sentences , POS tags , and opinions ) , ( b ) defining operators that represent interactions over those abstractions in an interface ( similar to the grammar of interaction graphics [ 20 ] ) , and ( c ) explicit modeling of stakeholder roles . Finally , managing these human - centered iterative workflows requires developing frameworks that manage the integration of tools and interfaces . In response , we propose the following design considerations for M - HCAI : An integrated workflow supporting multiple paradigms . Avoiding the context switching overhead during iteration requires integrating different modalities : programming environments and interactive interfaces ( e . g . , spreadsheets and visualization tools . ) Computational notebooks are suitable for such integration where programming can be complemented by introducing interactive widgets [ 26 , 7 ] . However , notebooks are not suitable for non - programmers involved in the HCAI process . Moreover , these tools neither manage the fine - grained provenance of user interactions nor support versioning . Therefore , research efforts for bridging these gaps are crucial for the holistic M - HCAI system design . Plastic interfaces as the basis for interaction . The multi - role inclusion challenge with computational notebooks can be addressed by developing custom interfaces that may act as boundary objects for the stakeholders . Boundary objects are artifacts that are “both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and the constraints of the several parties employing them , yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across site” [ 21 , 8 ] . Recent work introduces cross - platform capabilities to transform interactive widgets in notebooks into web dashboards that enable shared understanding among stakeholders within an organizational workflow [ 1 ] . However , these widgets are not provenance - aware , and the corresponding interactions are domain semantics agnostic . Therefore , further augmentation is required to employ these interfaces to operate in concert with the underlying system . Systems for supporting M - HCAI . Interactions among automated agents and stakeholders of different expertise and roles may occur at any phase . Therefore , the context ( where and when a task or interaction occurred ) , scope ( specific data domain and phase ) , and abstractions of interactions will vary depending on the scenario . To this end , knowledge graphs [ 11 ] ( KGs ) may serve as the core data model for the support systems managing M - HCAI workflows . KGs can explicitly capture diverse stakeholder roles and automated agents , different interaction types , and the corresponding context [ 6 ] . Existing work define grammars to capture operations for interactive text analysis [ 18 ] , information extraction [ 3 ] , and tabular data analysis [ 14 ] . Capturing domain - specific interaction contexts such as operations and data types would require defining such abstractions for M - HCAI . In this position paper , we draw attention to the multi - faceted nature of HCAI while identifying workflow and system - level challenges . We propose a research agenda that requires multi - disciplinary research efforts spanning databases , AI , visualization , and HCI . 2 References [ 1 ] A . Bäuerle , Á . A . Cabrera , F .
