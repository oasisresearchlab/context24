Drubin † Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California , Berkeley , California 94720 - 3202 Submitted November 25 , 1998 ; Accepted April 20 , 1999 Monitoring Editor : David Botstein Sla2p , also known as End4p and Mop2p , is the founding member of a widely conserved family of actin - binding proteins , a distinguishing feature of which is a C - terminal region homologous to the C terminus of talin . These proteins may function in actin cytoskeleton - mediated plasma membrane remodeling . A human homologue of Sla2p binds to hun - tingtin , the protein whose mutation results in Huntington’s disease . Here we establish by immunolocalization that Sla2p is a component of the yeast cortical actin cytoskeleton . Deletion analysis showed that Sla2p contains two separable regions , which can mediate association with the cortical actin cytoskeleton , and which can provide Sla2p function . One localization signal is actin based , whereas the other signal is independent of ﬁlamentous actin . Biochemical analysis showed that Sla2p exists as a dimer in vivo . Two - hybrid analysis revealed two intramolecular interactions mediated by coiled - coil domains . One of these interactions appears to underlie dimer formation . The other appears to contribute to the regulation of Sla2p distribution between the cytoplasm and plasma membrane . The data presented are used to develop a model for Sla2p regulation and interactions . INTRODUCTION SLA2 ( Synthetic Lethal with ABP1 ) , also known as END4 and MOP2 , is essential in yeast for correct or - ganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . It is also required for endocytosis and for accumulation or maintenance of a plasma membrane ATPase at the cell surface ( Raths et al . , 1993 ; Na et al . , 1995 ) . Sla2p might therefore facilitate actin - mediated plasma membrane remodeling . Cells lacking Sla2p are temperature sensitive for growth . In addition , they exhibit a disorganized actin cytoskeleton , and their cell surface growth is depolar - ized ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . Instead of the character - istic ellipsoid cell shape displayed by wild - type dip - loid cells , sla2 mutants are spherical . The cortical actin patches , normally spatially restricted to growing do - mains within the cell cortex , are no longer concen - trated at the surface of the bud and instead are dis - tributed evenly across the surface of the mother cell and the bud . Finally , sla2 mutant cells accumulate post - Golgi vesicles , possess an abnormally thick cell wall , and do not undergo the wild - type bipolar bud - ding pattern ( Mulholland et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ) . Several of these defects are characteristic of mutants affecting the cortical actin cytoskeleton . A deletion mutation of SLA2 is synthetically lethal with null alleles of at least three genes encoding components of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . These genes are ABP1 ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) , which encodes a protein containing a C - terminal Src homology 3 domain and an N - terminal ADF homology domain ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1998 ) , SRV2 ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) , which encodes a protein that binds to actin monomers and to adenylyl cy - clase , a component of the Ras signaling pathway in yeast ( Freeman et al . , 1995 , 1996 ) , and SAC6 ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) , which encodes the actin ﬁlament - bundling protein ﬁmbrin . A deletion mutant of SLA2 is also synthetic lethal with a deletion mutant of GCS1 . Gcs1p is a GTPase - activat - ing protein for Arf proteins in yeast that also appears to have a direct effect on actin dynamics ( Blader et al . , 1999 ) . These genetic interactions suggest that Sla2p , Sac6p , Srv2p , Abp1p , and Gcs1p contribute to common properties of the cytoskeleton . * Present address : Baylor College of Medicine , Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Houston , TX 77030 . † Corresponding author .

Homologues of Sla2p have been identiﬁed in nematodes , fruit ﬂies , mice , and humans . Hip1p , a human homologue of Sla2p , binds to huntingtin , the protein product of the Huntington’s disease ( HD ) gene ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ; Wanker et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , studies of Sla2p might provide insights into the etiology of HD . Sla2p and related proteins all share a similar arrangement of three predicted coiled - coil regions ( amino acids 360 – 580 , 700 – 730 , and 930 – 960 of Sla2p ) , as well as a C - terminal domain similar to the C terminus of talin , a protein found in focal adhesion plaques ( Figure 1A ) . Talin contains at least three actin - binding sites , one of which , amino acids 2269 – 2541 , spans the region that shows homology to Sla2p ( Hemmings et al . , 1996 ) . Indeed , this region of Sla2 has been shown by in vitro biochemical studies to bind to actin ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) . Previous studies have shown that Sla2p is a periph - eral membrane protein ( Na et al . , 1995 ; Wesp et al . , 1997 ) and is likely to be part of a protein complex in vivo . In addition , Sla2p sediments as a single peak at ; 10 . 6 S , which correlates to 220 kDa , or about twice its molecular mass ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . This behavior re - quired the presence of the large , central coiled - coil domain . Wesp and colleagues ( 1997 ) performed a do - main analysis in an attempt to correlate Sla2p’s func - tion with its various regions . A Sla2p N - terminal de - letion protein lacking amino acids 114 – 284 was unable to restore endocytosis , actin organization , and growth at high temperature in sla2 D mutant cells . Because none of the other deletion mutants of Sla2p exhibited this severe lack of activity , they concluded that the N - terminal region of Sla2p is indispensable for its cellular activity . Somewhat surprisingly , the talin - like domain was shown to be dispensable for endocytosis and growth at high temperature . Finally , as well as appearing to be involved in the formation of either a dimer or a multiprotein complex , the central coiled - coil domain of Sla2p was found to be required for endocytosis in genetic backgrounds mutant for ABP1 or SRV2 ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . In this study , we report on the cellular localization of Sla2p , demonstrating that it is a component of actin cortical patches . We also provide further analysis showing that different domains of the protein interact with each other and thereby regulate the localization and activity of Sla2p . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and Growth Conditions Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Standard yeast genetic procedures and media were used ( Rose et al . , 1990 ) . Except where noted , yeast strains were grown at 25°C in rich YPD media . Figure 1 . Domain arrangement of Sla2p . ( A ) Schematic diagram of identiﬁable domains in Sla2p . The three predicted coiled - coil forming domains are indicated , as well as glutamine - and proline - rich regions and the C - terminal talin - like domain . ( B ) The COILS program ( Lupas et al . , 1991 ) was used to predict the potential coiled - coil – forming domains of Sla2p and its homologues in humans ( Hip1p ) and nematodes ( GenBank accession number 1353119 ) . The probability of coiled coil formation is plotted as a function of the amino acid position in the protein . All three proteins are ; 950 amino acids in length , and , in addition to sharing secondary structure , they show ; 20 % identity over their lengths . S . Yang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2266 Plasmid Constructions and Other DNA Manipulations All DNA manipulations were performed by standard techniques ( Maniatis et al . , 1982 ; Ausubel et al . , 1989 ) . The PCR was used to create restriction enzyme sites for cloning purposes or to build gene disruption constructs ( Lorenz et al . , 1995 ) . Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2 . GST - Sla2p Fusion Proteins Different portions of SLA2 were cloned into pGEX - 2T or pGEX - 3X ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , Piscataway , NJ ) to create GST fu - sion proteins . The GST moiety could be cleaved from the fusion protein because pGEX - 2T contains a thrombin cleavage site , and pGEX - 3X contains a Factor Xa site . To construct a plasmid encoding a GST - Sla2p fusion containing amino acids 664 – 968 of Sla2p ( pDD356 ) , Bam HI linkers were added to a 1 . 1 - kb Rsa I SLA2 frag - ment , which was then was cloned into the Bam HI site of pGEX - 2T . For the GST - Sla2p fusion protein expressing amino acids 503 – 968 of Sla2p ( pDD358 ) , a plasmid containing SLA2 was digested with Pst I and Aat II . The ends of the 1 . 4 - kb fragment were ﬁlled in using T4 DNA polymerase . Bam HI linkers were then added , and the frag - ment was cloned into the Bam HI site of pGEX - 3X . To construct a plasmid encoding the GST - Sla2p fusion expressing amino acids 90 – 547 of Sla2p ( pDD361 ) , a plasmid containing SLA2 was digested with Bst YI . The resulting 1 . 4 - kb fragment was subcloned into the Bam HI site of pGEX - 2T . The resulting plasmids were screened by restriction analysis for those containing the insert in the correct orientation . pDD356 and pDD358 produce soluble fusion proteins , which were induced and puriﬁed as described ( Ausubel , 1990 ) . Fusion proteins were eluted from the glutathione – agarose beads with an excess of free glutathione ( 5 mM , pH 8 . 0 ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Alternatively , thrombin ( Sigma ) or Factor Xa ( Boehringer Mann - heim , Indianapolis , IN ) was used to cleave and , in doing so , solu - bilize the Sla2p portion of the fusion protein . pDD361 produces mainly insoluble fusion protein . However , an “inclusion body” preparation from a strain expressing this plasmid provided partially puriﬁed protein that was used for generating antibodies ( see be - low ) . Cells were prepared in the same manner as above , except that here the majority of the fusion protein is insoluble and present in the pellet . The fusion protein comprised most ( 90 % ) of the protein in the pellet . To purify the protein , the pellet was solubilized using sample buffer containing 2 % SDS and then run on an SDS - PAGE gel . Protein was eluted from the gel as described in ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . Antibodies Antibodies against Sla2p were raised in New Zealand White rabbits , essentially as described in ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . To generate antibodies against the Sla2p C terminus , Sla2p amino acids 664 – 968 were fused to GST ( pDD356 ) . A GST fusion protein containing Sla2p amino acids 90 – 547 ( pDD361 ) was used to generate the Sla2p N - terminal antibodies . The GST - Sla2 fusion from pDD356 was not further puriﬁed after glutathione elution from Sepharose beads , whereas the GST - Sla2 fusion protein from pDD361 was puriﬁed by excision of Coomassie blue – stained bands from SDS - PAGE gels . Approximately 100 m g of fusion protein were used for each injec - tion . Freund’s complete adjuvant was used for the ﬁrst immuniza - tion , and Freund’s incomplete adjuvant was used for subsequent injections ( days 21 , 36 , and 78 ) . Antisera were afﬁnity puriﬁed against Sla2p as follows . The GST - Sla2 fusion protein from pDD358 ( amino acids 503 – 968 of Sla2p ) was cleaved with Factor Xa and then puriﬁed further by excision of Coomassie blue – stained bands from SDS - PAGE gels . The protein was coupled to cyanogen bromide ( CNBr ) – activated beads , gener - ating a column containing only Sla2p amino acids 503 – 968 . This column was then used for afﬁnity puriﬁcation of the C - terminal antibody . The resulting afﬁnity - puriﬁed antiserum recognized a protein with apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa in immunoblots of whole - cell extracts ( 1 : 5000 dilution ) ( Figure 2A ) . This band was absent in sla2 D whole - cell extract . However , the antiserum also recognized another protein with apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa in whole - cell extract from wild - type or sla2 D cells . Cross - reactivity of the antibody with this protein did not effect the localization of Sla2p by indirect immunoﬂuorescence , however , because sla2 D cells showed only faint background staining using this antibody . For the N - terminal antibody , antisera were ﬁrst adsorbed to GST - coupled Table 1 .

Sla2p Is Regulated by Intramolecular Interactions Vol . 10 , July 1999 2267 CNBr beads to deplete the anti - GST antibodies . The GST - Sla2 fusion protein from pDD361 was puriﬁed in the same manner as that used for the rabbit injections and coupled to CNBr beads . Additionally , a smaller amount of soluble GST - Sla2 fusion protein was puriﬁed by excision of Coomassie blue – stained bands from SDS - PAGE gels and then coupled to CNBr - activated beads to generate an afﬁnity col - umn containing only the GST - Sla2 fusion protein . Antisera afﬁnity - puriﬁed on either column recognized similar proteins in immuno - blots , although lower - titer antiserum was obtained using the latter column . These antisera ( 1 : 5000 ) recognized a protein with apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa that is absent in sla2 D whole - cell extract . They also recognized less strongly a protein with apparent molec - ular mass of 70 kDa that is present in sla2 D whole - cell extract . However , the reactivity against the 70 - kDa protein was variable and not always observed . Polyclonal rabbit anti - myc antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy Yeast cells grown to early exponential phase in either YPD or supplemented synthetic media were prepared for immunoﬂuores - cence as described previously ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) . The cold meth - anol – acetone ﬁxation – permeabilization step , which is required for anti - actin reactivity , is not required for anti - Sla2p reactivity but results in better staining ( probably because of the ﬂattening of the cells allowing easier visualization of the staining pattern ) . Both anti - N - and anti - C - terminal afﬁnity - puriﬁed rabbit anti - Sla2p anti - sera were used for immunoﬂuorescence at a dilution of 1 : 50 . Anti - actin guinea pig antiserum ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) was used at a 1 : 1000 dilution . Detection was accomplished by applying either FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit or FITC - conjugated goat anti - guinea pig antibodies ( Cappel / Organon Teknika , Malvern , PA ) at a dilution of 1 : 1000 or CY3 - conjugated sheep anti - rabbit antibodies ( Sigma ) at a dilution of 1 : 200 . Cells were visualized with a Zeiss Axioscop ﬂuorescence microscope with an HB100 W / Z high - pres - sure mercury lamp and a Zeiss 100 3 Plan - Neoﬂuar oil immersion objective ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) . Images were captured elec - tronically using a 200 - E charge - coupled device camera ( Sony Elec - tronics , San Jose , CA ) using Northern Exposure software ( Phase 3 Imaging Systems , Milford , MA ) . Endocytosis Assays Endocytosis was assayed using the internalization of Lucifer yellow ( LY ; Sigma - Aldrich - Fluka , Milwaukee , WI ) as a marker , according to the method described by Dulic et al . ( 1991 ) . Creation of a Diploid Strain Expressing myc Epitope - tagged and Histidine - tagged Sla2p A 10 - histidine tag ﬂanked by Bam HI sites was placed at the N terminus of Sla2p using a PCR - stitching strategy .

( 1995 ) . S . Yang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2268 used high - ﬁdelity DNA polymerases , and all relevant constructs were sequenced for accuracy . Two ﬁrst - round PCR reactions were per - formed between 1 ) primers Sla2Htag5 ( CAGGATGATGATTCGGA - TCCTCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATGGGGATCCA - AACTGATCATGAATTGTAC ) and M13Universal ( GTAAAACGAC - GGCCAGTG ) and 2 ) primers Sla2Htag6 ( GTACAATTCATG ATCAGTTTGGATCCCCATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATG - ATGAGGATCCGAATCATCATCCTG ) and Sla2Htag7 ( GATGTTAC - CGATGCATGC ) using pDD550 as template , which is an Eco RI genomic fragment containing SLA2 inserted into pBluescript II SK 1 ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . The products of the ﬁrst two PCR reactions were mixed and reampliﬁed using the outside primers M13Universal and Sla2Htag7 . The resulting ampliﬁed DNA was digested with Hin - dIII and Pﬂ MI and used to replace a Hin dIII – Pﬂ MI fragment from pDD550 , generating an SLA2 gene encoding Sla2p with a C - terminal 10 - His tag ( . . . DDDSDPHHHHHHHHHHGDPNstop ) , ﬂanked by Bam HI sites . The 10 - His tag was replaced with a 6 - myc tag ( 6xMEQKLISEED - LNE ) ﬂanked by Bam HI sites . A Not I site was placed after the predicted polyadenylation signals 3 9 of SLA2 using the mutagenic primer Sla2NotIins ( CATATCACATCTCTGGCGGCCGCTAC - CATTTTGCTTC ) . The URA3 gene , ﬂanked by Not I sites ( from pJC56 , which is pBluescript II SK 1 containing URA3 ﬂanked by Sma I / Xba I and Not I sites ; our unpublished data ) was inserted to generate auxotrophically marked constructs . During these manipu - lations , pUC118 and pGEM - 9Z were used as intermediate vectors . The Eco RI - digested inserts from pDD551 ( 10 - His C - terminal tagged Sla2 with URA3 marker in pUC118 ) and pDD552 ( 6 - myc C - terminal tagged Sla2 with URA3 marker in pGEM - 9Z ) were used to transform DDY1166 , which contains the HIS3 gene in place of the deleted SLA2 gene . Colonies that were Ura 1 and His 2 were selected , and the inser - tion of tagged SLA2 was conﬁrmed by PCR using JCYNL243F ( CTG - GATCCTTGACAATGTTAC ) and JCYNL243R ( CTACTACTGTCT - GAAGAGC ) as primers . Both the 10 - His and 6 - myc constructs ( in DDY1550 and DDY1551 , respectively ) complemented various sla2 null phenotypes fully ( our unpublished results ) . DDY1551 was crossed with DDY131 and sporulated , and haploid , Ura 1 , and Mat a progeny were identiﬁed ( DDY1554 ) . DDY1550 and DDY1554 were crossed to create diploid yeast ( DDY1556 ) containing one copy of SLA2 tagged with 6 - His and one copy tagged with 6 - myc . DDY1551 and DDY1554 were crossed to create diploid yeast ( DDY1557 ) with both copies of SLA2 tagged with 6 - myc . Fractionation of Yeast Cell Extracts Cell extracts for sucrose gradient fractionation were prepared using a liquid nitrogen grinding method . Exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with cold dou - ble - distilled H 2 O and once with buffer C ( 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM DTT ) . Cells were then resuspended into an equal - weight volume of buffer C with the addition of protease inhibitors ( antipain , leupeptin , pepstatin A , chymostatin , and aprotinin at 1 m g / ml and 10 m M PMSF and 1 mM benzamidine ) . The cell suspension was then drop frozen in liquid nitrogen . Depending on the amount of material , cells were lysed either manually using a mortar and pestle , or in a 1 - l Waring blender . Liquid nitrogen was used liberally to ensure that cells remained frozen at all times . The cell lysate was then thawed at room temperature to obtain crude extract . All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C . At this point , if detergent - solubilized extract was desired , Nonidet P - 40 was added to 0 . 2 % . The lysate was then spun at 1000 3 g to clear unlysed cells and cell debris . The extract was then spun at 100 , 000 3 g to obtain the high - speed supernatant fraction for loading onto the sucrose gradient . The pellet and su - pernatant fractions were assayed by immunoblotting to determine the amount of Sla2p present ; usually , Sla2p was present at approx - imately equal levels in both fractions . For isolation of 6 - histidine – tagged Sla2p , the above procedure was modiﬁed as follows : no EDTA was present in the extraction buffer , and 15 mM b - mercaptoethanol was used instead of DTT . Also , a medium - speed centrifugation was introduced ( 15 , 000 3 g for 10 min ) , after which the pellet was resuspended in modiﬁed buffer C plus 100 mM NaCl and 0 . 5 % 3 - [ ( 3 - cholamidopropyl ) dim - ethylammonio ] - 1 - propanesulfonic acid . The resulting solutions were spun at 250 , 000 3 g for 30 min . The supernatants were prein - cubated with Sepharose CL - 6B beads ( Amersham - Pharmacia Bio - tech ) to remove proteins that bind to this matrix nonspeciﬁcally , and then applied to an Ni - NTA column ( Qiagen , Chatsworth , CA ) . The columns were washed , and the bound protein was eluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The high - speed supernatant de - rived from the medium - speed pellet ( i . e . , the material that was extractable only in the presence of high salt and detergent ) was termed the membrane extract . Sucrose Gradients Linear sucrose gradients ( 11 ml of 3 – 30 % ) in buffer C were prepared in Ultra - Clear centrifuge tubes ( Beckman , Palo Alto , CA ) . Samples ( 400 m l ) of yeast extract or protein molecular mass standards were layered on top . The gradients were spun at 34 , 000 rpm in an SW41 rotor for 15 h at 4°C . Fractions ( 400 m l ) were removed manually and then assayed on SDS - PAGE . Immunoblotting was used to deter - mine the position of various proteins . Native high - molecular - mass proteins ( thyroglobulin , 669 kDa ; ferritin , 440 kDa ; catalase , 232 kDa ; aldolase , 158 kDa ; and BSA , 66 kDa ) ( Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) were used to calibrate the gradients . For immunoblots , anti - Srv2p antibody ( Freeman et al . , 1996 ) was used at a dilution of 1 : 5000 , anti - Sac6p antibody ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) at 1 : 500 , and anti - Abp1p antibody at 1 : 5000 ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) . HRP - conjugated secondary antibody was used at 1 : 5000 , and detected using the ECL chemiluminescence kit ( Amersham , Arlington Heights , IL ) . Sla2p Deletions and Truncation Sla2p C - terminal truncation mutants were generated using a PCR gene deletion strategy ( Lorenz et al . , 1995 ) . Oligonucleotides containing 54 or 55 nucleotides ( nt ) homologous to portions of SLA2 and 20 or 21 nt homologous to pRS vector sequences ﬂanking URA3 were used as primers in PCR reactions amplifying the URA3 gene . All PCR reactions used primer SY16 ( 5 9 - AAATATATTTATATTAACGTTTATCTTTAT - ATATAAAAAGTACAATTCATGATCACTGTGCGGTATTTCACA - CCGC - 3 9 ) , which contains 55 nt homologous to the 3 9 region of SLA2 immediately following its stop codon as well as 21 nt homologous to a region 3 9 of the URA3 gene . The other primer used in the PCR reaction contains 54 nt homologous to various regions of the SLA2 ( depending on the desired truncation ) , a stop codon , and 20 nt homologous to a region 5 9 of the URA3 gene ( ; 100 nt before the URA3 start codon ) . Primer SY18 ( 5 9 - GTTGC - CACTGCTGACAAAATTGTCAAATCCTCAGAACACTTACGT - GTTGACGTTTGAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACC - 3 9 ) contains homology until amino acid 768 , primer SY20 ( 5 9 - CTATACTCCCAG - TTGCGTCAAGAGCATCTAAATCTTTTACCTCGTTTTAAAAAAT - GAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACC - 3 9 ) contains homology until amino acid 501 , and primer SY21 ( 5 9 - GGTGCAGCTAACGCCATTTTTCCA - CAGGCGACGGCACAAATGCAGCCGGACTTCTGAGATTGTACTG - AGAGTGCACC - 3 9 ) contains homology until amino acid 359 . The resulting PCR products consist of the URA3 gene ﬂanked by ; 50 nt of SLA2 sequence . They were puriﬁed using the Qiaquick PCR puriﬁcation kit ( Qiagen ) and then used to transform wild - type diploid yeast ( DDY426 ) . If integrated at the SLA2 locus , the PCR construct should delete a speciﬁc amount SLA2 ( depending on the construct ) and insert the URA3 gene . PCR was performed on genomic DNA from Ura 1 transformants to determine whether the PCR product integrated at the SLA2 locus . The presence of a trun - cated gene product of the predicted length was further conﬁrmed by immunoblotting using an Sla2p antibody . The heterozygous diploids were then sporulated to generate haploids expressing a Sla2p Is Regulated by Intramolecular Interactions Vol . 10 , July 1999 2269 truncated Sla2p . Homozygous diploids were obtained by mating the appropriate haploids . Two Nsi I sites are naturally present in SLA2 , one before codon 33 and one after codon 896 . Additional Nsi I sites were inserted before codon 751 , codon 502 , or codon 360 through PCR using primers SY5 ( 5 9 - GCATGCATAGTTGCCACTGCTGAC - 3 9 ) and SY7 ( 5 9 - GTTGCT - GCTGTTGCGAAG - 3 9 ) , SY6 ( 5 9 - GCATGCATACTGCAGTTAAAGGT - C - 3 9 ) and SY7 , or SY26 ( 5 9 - GCATGCATATGGGCCAATCAACAAG - CC - 3 9 ) and SY7 respectively . Primers SY26 and SY34 ( 5 9 - CGATGCA - TACTAGGCATCCAGAATAGGGTTC - 3 9 ) were used to insert an Nsi I site before codon 360 and to insert an Nsi I site and a stop codon after codon 576 . The PCR - generated Nsi I fragments were then used to replace the normal Nsi I fragment of pDD353 or pDD354 ( SLA2 in pRS313 ; Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) or YEP430 ( Ma et al . , 1987 ) . All PCR - generated DNA that was not later replaced with plasmid DNA was sequenced , and no PCR - induced base pair changes were found . Thus , eight plasmids were obtained ( Table 2 ) : pDD362 ( sla2 D 33 – 750 in pRS313 ) , pDD363 ( sla2 D 33 – 750 in YEP430 ) , pDD364 ( sla2 D 33 – 501 in pRS313 ) , pDD365 ( sla2 D 33 – 501 in YEP430 ) , pDD367 ( sla2 D 33 – 359 in pRS313 ) , pDD368 ( sla2 D 33 – 359 in YEP430 ) , pDD369 ( sla2 D 33 – 359 , 576 stop in pRS313 ) , and pDD370 ( sla2 D 33 – 359 , 576 stop in YEP430 ) . To construct a GAL1 promoter - driven sla2 D 33 – 750 ( pDD366 ) , the Nsi I fragment of pDD362 was used to replace the Nsi I fragment of pDD355 , a plasmid containing GAL1 - SLA2 . In the above cloning procedures , when necessary , pBluescript , which contains no Nsi I sites , was used as the shuttle vector . Primer SY23 ( 5 9 - GCACAAATGCAGCCGGACTTC - GATGCCATATTGGAAAGCGGTATC - 3 9 ) was used with the Clon - tech Transformer Mutagenesis kit ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) to delete Sla2p codons 360 – 576 , generating pDD371 ( sla2 D 360 – 575 in pRS313 ) and pDD372 ( sla2 D 360 – 575 in YEP430 ) . Two - Hybrid Interactions Residues 503 – 968 of Sla2p were fused to the Gal4p DNA - binding domain by cloning the Bam HI fragment of pDD356 into pAS1 - CYH2 ( Durfee et al . , 1993 ) ( to generate pDD373 ) . Residues 768 – 968 of Sla2p were fused to the Gal4p DNA - binding domain by cloning the Hin cII – Rsa I SLA2 fragment into pAS1 - CYH2 ( to generate pDD374 ) . SY11 ( 5 9 - CGGGATCCTGCAGTTAAAGGTG - 3 9 ) and SY12 ( 5 9 - GCG - GATCCTCAGTCAACACGTAAGTG - 3 9 ) were used as primers in a PCR reaction to create Bam HI sites ﬂanking Sla2p residues 502 – 767 , and the resulting fragment was cloned into pACTII ( Durfee et al . , 1993 ) ( which contains the Gal4p activation domain ) to generate pDD375 . SY13 ( 5 9 - CGCCATGGATGCCATATTGGAAAGCGG - 3 9 ) and SY12 were used as primers in a PCR reaction to create Nco I and Bam HI sites ﬂanking Sla2p residues 575 – 767 . The resulting fragment was cloned into pACTII to generate pDD376 . SY14 ( 5 9 - CGCCATG - GTTGCCACTGCTGAC - 3 9 ) and SY15 ( 5 9 - GCGGATCCTTATTCG - GATGTGAAGTCCAA - 3 9 ) were used as primers in a PCR reaction to create Nco I and Bam HI sites ﬂanking Sla2p residues 751 – 930 . The resulting fragment was cloned into pAS1 - CYH2 to generate pDD377 . SY29 ( 5 9 - CGCCATGGATTCAGATCTGCAGAAAGCG - 3 9 ) and SY31 ( 5 9 - GCGGATCCTCAGGCATCCAGAATAGGG - 3 9 ) were used as primers in a PCR reaction to create Nco I and Bam HI sites ﬂanking Sla2p residues 5 – 576 . The resulting fragment was sub - cloned into pACTII to generate pDD379 or into pAS1 - CYH2 to generate pDD378 . All PCR products were sequenced to conﬁrm the absence of any Taq polymerase - generated errors or were replaced with plasmid DNA . The plasmids were transformed into yeast strain Y190 ( Durfee et al . , 1993 ) . Immunoblotting of whole - cell ex - tract from these strains , using either anti - Sla2p antibody or anti - hemagglutinin antibody ( both pACTII and pAS1 - CYH2 contain a hemagglutinin tag ) , conﬁrmed the expression of a fusion protein of the expected size . To determine whether the different proteins can interact with each other , pairwise combinations of the plasmids were transformed into Y190 . This strain contains the Escherichia coli lacZ gene and the HIS3 gene under control of the GAL1 promotor . If the proteins bind to each other , the cells can grow in media ( His 2 / 3 - AT ) lacking histidine and containing 25 mM 3 - aminotriazole , and b - galactosidase is expressed . The plasmids pAS1 - CYH2 , pACTII , pSE1111 , and pSE1112 , and the yeast strain Y190 were kindly pro - vided by Steve Elledge ( Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX ) . The actin 2 - hybrid plasmids were kindly provided by David Am - berg ( State University of New York , Health Science Center , Syra - cuse , NY ) . RESULTS Immunolocalization of Sla2p The genetic interactions and morphological defects of the sla2 mutants show that Sla2p is necessary for the correct functioning of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . To determine the cellular localization of Sla2p , we raised polyclonal antisera against its N terminus ( aa 90 – 547 ) and its C terminus ( aa 664 – 968 ) . Both antisera recognize a 116 - kDa protein that is absent in sla2 D extracts ( Figure 2A ) , and both produce similar immu - noﬂuorescence staining patterns ( below ) . In wild - type cells , Sla2p localizes to cortical patches at the growing surfaces of the cell ( Figure 2 ) . The Sla2p staining pattern , however , is distinct from that of ac - tin . First , although staining is detectable in medium - and large - budded cells , the staining is strongest in unbudded and small budded cells . Second , Sla2p co - localizes with the actin cortical patches , but it appears that not every actin cortical patch contains Sla2p ( Fig - ure 2B ) . Finally , Sla2p appears to be present in some cortical patches independent of actin . This is most apparent in medium - and large - budded cells , in which only ; 45 % of Sla2p patches overlap with actin patches , compared with an 85 % overlap in unbudded and small - budded cells . Similarly , only ; 40 % of actin patches in medium - and large - budded cells also con - tain Sla2p , compared with 85 % in unbudded and small - budded cells . Thus , a subset of the actin patches contains Sla2p , and a subset of the Sla2p patches con - tains actin . The latter observation is consistent with the ability of Sla2p to achieve a partial polarized cor - tical localization in cells lacking ﬁlamentous actin ( Ay - scough et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore , we also observed that known actin cortical patch components ( i . e . , Abp1p , Sac6p , and coﬁlin ) colocalize 100 % with cortical actin , and their localization is unchanged in sla2 D mutants ( our un - published results ) . Effects of Sla2p Deletion and Truncation Mutations on Cell Growth Properties Sla2p shares with its homologues in other organisms an extensive , internal , predicted coiled - coil region . In addition , its C terminus is similar to that of talin and contains an actin - binding site ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) . Previously , Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) determined that only the N terminus of Sla2p is absolutely essential for growth at high temperatures , for endocytosis , and for correct actin cytoskeleton organization . In strains car - S . Yang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2270 rying mutations in ABP1 or SRV2 , the large central coiled - coil domain of Sla2p becomes essential for the above - listed functions as well . The in vivo roles of the various Sla2p domains , however , have yet to be fully explored . To further identify and clarify the roles of Sla2p domains , we have produced eight new truncation and deletion mu - tants of SLA2 ( summarized in Figure 3 ) and have tested these for their ability to complement the various phenotypes caused by a complete deletion of SLA2 . Our analysis supports conclusions reached by Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) but also provides novel insights , which lead us to propose a revised model for Sla2p function . First , the importance of Sla2p’s C terminus was ex - plored by creating three Sla2p C - terminal truncation mutants ( Figure 3A ) , each of which was integrated Figure 2 .

Sla2p D 768 – 968 expresses residues 1 – 767 and lacks the entire talin homology region . This mutant is almost identical to the sla2 D talin mutant described by Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) , which expresses resi - dues 1 – 766 . Sla2p D 501 – 968 expresses residues 1 – 500 , a region that includes two - thirds of the predicted large coiled - coil region and terminates at the end of a pre - dicted leucine zipper motif . Sla2p D 360 – 968 expresses residues 1 – 359 and lacks this predicted coiled - coil re - gion altogether . Immunoblots performed on yeast ex - tracts generated from strains expressing the different C - terminal truncation mutants showed that each ex - Figure 3 . Expression and temperature growth proﬁle of Sla2p deletion proteins . ( A ) C - terminal deletions . Crude extracts were prepared from wild - type ( full - length Sla2p ; DDY426 ) and mutant cells containing the Sla2p C - terminal deletions Sla2 D 768 – 968 ( DDY1194 ) , Sla2 D 501 – 968 ( DDY1195 ) , and Sla2 D 360 – 968 ( DDY1196 ) , grown at 25°C , and then shifted to 37°C for 3 h . Equal cell equivalents ( based on A 600 absorbance ) were immunoblotted using the N - terminal Sla2p antibody . Cells expressing wild - type or Sla2p C - terminal deletion mutants were then replica plated and grown for 36 h ( 37 and 34°C ) , 48 h ( 30 and 25°C ) , 72 h ( 20°C ) , or 5 d ( 14°C ) on YPD plates before being photographed . ( B ) N - terminal and central coiled - coil domain deletions . Crude extracts were prepared from wild - type ( DDY426 ) cells containing pRS313 ( empty vector ) and sla2 D ( DDY540 ) cells containing pDD367 ( Sla2 D 33 – 359 ) , pDD364 ( Sla2 D 33 – 501 ) , pDD362 ( Sla2 D 33 – 750 ) , pDD371 ( Sla2 D 360 – 575 ) , pDD369 ( Sla2 D 33 – 359 , 576 stop ) , or vector alone , grown at 25°C , and then shifted to 37°C for 3 h . Equal cell equivalents from the 25°C cultures or the 37°C - shifted cultures were immunoblotted using the C - terminal Sla2p antibody , except for extracts containing pDD369 , in which case the N - terminal Sla2p antibody was used . Wild - type and sla2 D cells containing vector alone or expressing these Sla2p deletion mutants were then replica plated and grown for 2 d ( 37 and 34°C ) , 3 d ( 30 and 25°C ) , 5 d ( 20°C ) , or 8 d ( 14°C ) on SC - his plates before being photographed as shown . The ﬁrst spot of each panel represents growth with a low - copy - number plasmid , and the second spot represents growth with a high - copy - number plasmid . ( C ) Sla2 D 33 – 750 overexpression is recessive - lethal . Wild - type and sla2 D cells express - ing either Sla2 D 33 – 750 under the control of the galactose - inducible GAL1 promotor or containing vector alone ( pYES - R ) were grown on glucose - or galactose - containing media at 25 or 37°C for 72 h before being photographed .

( 4 ) sla2 D cells expressing galactose - inducible Sla2 D 33 – 750 . S . Yang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2272 pressed a protein of approximately the predicted size ( Figure 3A ) . Although sla2 D mutant cells are unable to grow at 34°C or above ( Figure 3B , vector alone ) all of the C - terminal truncation mutants were able to grow at 34°C . In addition , only cells carrying the largest trun - cation , sla2 D 360 – 968 , failed to grow at 37°C ( Figure 3A ) . These results suggest that the N - terminal third of Sla2p is sufﬁcient to fulﬁll a critical role of Sla2p and perhaps represents the essential functional region of Sla2p , consistent with the observations of Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) . To delineate further the functionality of the N - ter - minal region of Sla2p , three Sla2p N - terminal deletion mutations were generated ( Figure 3B ) . Sla2p D 33 – 750 comprises almost solely the talin - like domain . Sla2p D 33 – 501 contains the talin - like domain and the 250 amino acids preceding it . Sla2p D 33 – 359 contains both the extensive internal coiled - coil region and the talin - like domain but lacks the N - terminal third of the protein . These Sla2p deletion mutants were intro - duced into sla2 D mutant cells on either low - or high - copy plasmids and were tested for expression ( Figure 3B ) . One of the three Sla2p N - terminal deletion mutants , Sla2p D 33 – 359 , rescued the temperature sensitivity of the sla2 D cells ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , the N terminus is not absolutely required for Sla2p functionality . A less se - vere deletion ( of residues 114 – 284 ) did not support growth in the hands of Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) . The reason for this discrepancy is unknown ( possibilities dis - cussed below ) . Overexpression of Sla2p D 33 – 750 , the talin - like domain , not only failed to support growth at the higher temperatures , but it seemed to have a del - eterious effect on growth , in contrast to the overex - pression of full - length Sla2p , which has no effect on cell growth ( our unpublished results ) . To characterize this deleterious effect further , the Sla2p D 33 – 750 dele - tion protein was expressed from the powerful GAL1 promoter ( pDD366 ) . Overexpression of the talin - like domain in sla2 D cells was lethal , even at 25°C ( Figure 3C ) . Wild - type cells transformed with pDD366 or plas - mid vector alone , however , showed no obvious differ - ence in their ability to grow on galactose , showing that this effect is recessive . Additional effects of overex - pression of the talin - like domain are discussed below . In the experiments described above , only a portion of the large predicted coiled - coil domain ( residues 360 – 500 ) , as well as the ﬁrst 32 Sla2p residues , were found to be indispensable for growth at high temper - atures . To test the importance of the central coiled - coil domain in Sla2p function directly , two additional de - letion mutants were generated . Sla2p D 360 – 575 lacks the entire predicted coiled - coil domain , whereas Sla2p D 33 – 359 , 576 stop comprises almost solely the pre - dicted coiled - coil domain . These mutants were again expressed in sla2 D cells on either low - or high - copy plasmids and were tested for expression ( Figure 3B ) . We found that sla2 D cells expressing the various con - structs had growth characteristics similar to those of cells carrying vector alone ( Figure 3B ) . Intriguingly , the corresponding coiled - coil deletion of Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) , which removes residues 376 – 573 , was able to complement most of the sla2 mutant phenotype . This result is further discussed below . Effects of Sla2 Deletion Mutations on Cell Morphology and Actin Organization The relative ability of different Sla2p mutants to rescue the temperature - sensitive growth of sla2 D mutant cells is a sensitive measure of function . However , the eval - uation of growth properties alone does not provide insight into the nature of the underlying defects in cells expressing the Sla2p mutants . Therefore , we next examined the effects of sla2 mutations on actin cy - toskeleton organization . The data presented below in - dicate that Sla2p is capable of mediating the polariza - tion of actin patches in the absence of either the C - terminal 468 residues or the N - terminal 360 residues ( or , more speciﬁcally , residues 33 – 359 ) . Effects on the actin cytoskeleton thus parallel effects on growth at high temperatures , suggesting that the ability to de - velop polarized actin cytoskeleton organization is re - quired for growth at high temperatures . The actin cytoskeletons of cells expressing the dif - ferent Sla2p deletion mutants were visualized after growth at 25 and 37°C . The phenotypes were gener - ally more severe at 37°C ( our unpublished results ) . Cells grown at 25°C are shown in Figure 4 , and results are summarized in Figure 5 . sla2 D mutant cells ex - pressing Sla2p D 360 – 968 ( Figure 4D ) , Sla2p D 360 – 575 ( Figure 4H ) , Sla2p D 33 – 501 ( Figure 4F ) , or Sla2p D 33 – 359 , 576 stop ( Figure 4I ) all exhibited morphological and actin phenotypes similar to those observed for the null mutant . These cells were round , they exhibited an increased number of cortical actin patches , and their patches were not restricted to the bud . sla2 D mutant cells expressing Sla2p D 501 – 968 ( Figure 4C ) or Sla2p D 33 – 359 ( Figure 4E ) were also round , but they exhibited largely polarized cortical actin patches . These patches did look “chunkier” ( i . e . , larger and less discrete ) than those in wild - type cells . When these mutant cells were grown at 37°C , they still retained a polarized actin cytoskeleton , but the actin patches be - came even chunkier ( our unpublished results ) . sla2 D cells expressing Sla2p D 768 – 968 , lacking the talin - like domain , do not exhibit any obvious defects in actin organization at 25°C ( Figure 4B ) . These cells retain a polarized actin cytoskeleton at 37°C but ex - hibit fainter cables and chunkier cortical patches ( our unpublished results ) . On the other hand , expression of the talin domain alone ( Sla2p D 33 – 750 ) not only failed to restore wild - type morphology to sla2 D cells but Sla2p Is Regulated by Intramolecular Interactions Vol . 10 , July 1999 2273 resulted in a more abnormal actin cytoskeleton ( Figure 4G ) . These cells seem to contain more cortical actin , and some cells also contain actin “cables , ” which ap - pear much thicker than those seen in wild - type cells . The exaggerated actin cables could be stained by rhoda - mine – phalloidin ( our unpublished results ) , indicating that they contain ﬁlamentous actin . Thus , they are different from the actin bars that are found in some actin cytoskeleton mutants and that are thought to consist of aggregates of monomeric or denatured ac - tin . Effects of expression of the talin - like domain alone on actin organization were seen in wild - type back - ground and therefore are dominant . sla2 D cells exhibit an abnormal budding pattern ( Yang et al . , 1997 ) . Of the eight mutants , only Sla2p D 768 – 968 restored the wild - type bipolar bud - ding pattern in MAT a / MAT a cells . Again , no domi - nant effects were observed . Endocytosis in sla2 Mutants We tested the ability of the sla2 truncation and dele - tion mutants to undergo ﬂuid phase endocytosis as assayed by the ability to take up LY an concentrate it the vacuole . The ability of the sla2 mutants to endocy - tose closely followed their ability to grow at high temperatures . Cells expressing Sla2p D 768 – 968 , Sla2p D 501 – 968 , or Sla2p D 33 – 359 were able to endocy - tose LY at both 25 and 37°C , whereas cells expressing the ﬁve remaining mutants were unable to do so even at 25°C . Additionally , overexpression of the ﬁve plas - mid - based sla2 mutants in wild - type cells did not af - Figure 4 . Actin cytoskeleton organization in sla2 D cells and cellular localization of the Sla2 deletion mutant proteins . The yeast strains are those described in Figure 3 , A and B , with all plasmids being low copy number ( CEN ) , except for pDD368 , which is a high - copy - number ( 2 m ) plasmid expressing Sla2 D 33 – 359 . Cells were grown at 25°C and were then ﬁxed and stained with either anti - actin antibodies , or anti - Sla2p antibodies , as indicated . Cells expressing Sla2p D 360 – 968 , Sla2p D 501 – 968 , and Sla2p D 33 – 359 , 576 stop were stained with the N - terminal Sla2p antibody . The remaining cells were stained with the C - terminal Sla2p antibody . S . Yang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2274 fect their ability to endocytose LY ; therefore , the mu - tants did not confer any dominant effects . Cellular Localization of the Sla2p Deletion Proteins The generation of polyclonal antibodies capable of de - tecting Sla2p localization by indirect immunoﬂuores - cence allowed us to determine the effect of the eight sla2 mutations on the cellular localization of Sla2p . Double labeling with Sla2p and actin antibodies was performed for each mutant and is shown in Figure 4 . Sla2p D 768 – 968 ( Figure 4B ) exhibited a localization indistinguishable from that of full - length Sla2p . sla2 D mutants expressing either Sla2p D 501 – 968 ( Figure 4C ) or Sla2p D 33 – 359 ( Figure 4E ) contain chunkier actin cortical patches near or in the bud , and the mutant Sla2p colocalizes with these patches . Although there Figure 5 . Sla2p domain analysis summary . The phenotypes of the Sla2p C - terminal truncation and N - terminal deletion mutants are summarized . The schematics indicate the regions of Sla2p expressed in each case and reﬂect the domain arrangement shown in Figure 1A . The phenotypic analysis was performed in sla2 D cells expressing the different Sla2p mutants , from either a genomic copy ( the three C - terminal mutants were integrated into the genome ) or from a high - or low - copy - number plasmid ( the ﬁve N - terminal deletion mutants ) . Sla2p Is Regulated by Intramolecular Interactions Vol . 10 , July 1999 2275 seems to be more Sla2p D 360 – 968 in the cytoplasm , this protein is still present in cortical patches but at apparently reduced levels ( Figure 4D ) . Sla2p D 360 – 575 ( Figure 4H ) still localizes to cortical patches , but these patches were evenly spread over both mother and bud , and , intriguingly , many seem not to contain ac - tin . Sla2p D 33 – 750 ( Figure 4G ) colocalizes with actin cortical patches and the aberrant thick actin cables . The remaining two deletion proteins , Sla2p D 33 – 501 ( Figure 4F ) and Sla2p D 33 – 359 , 576 stop ( Figure 4I ) both exhibited cytoplasmic localization and not cortical patch localization . Full - length Sla2p displays partially polarized corti - cal localization in cells treated with the actin depoly - merizing drug latruculin A ( latA ) ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . We assayed the localization pattern of the three Sla2p C - terminal truncation mutants ( Sla2p D 768 – 968 , Sla2p D 501 – 968 , and Sla2p D 360 – 968 ) when cells were grown in the presence of latA . All three mutants dis - played some partially polarized cortical localization ( our unpublished results ) . Thus , both the N - terminal 360 residues and the C - terminal talin - like domain of Sla2p are capable of lo - calizing to cortical actin patches independent of the rest of the protein . In addition , the N - terminal third of Sla2p seems to achieve its localization independently of ﬁlamentous actin , whereas evidence discussed be - low points to actin as the localization signal for the C - terminal talin - like domain . Synthetic Lethality with abp1 D and sac6 D sla2 D is synthetic lethal with abp1 D and sac6 D mutants ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . We tested the sla2 deletion and truncation mutants for synthetic lethality with either abp1 D or sac6 D mutations . Seven of the eight deletion mutants were synthetic lethal with both abp1 D and sac6 D , the exception being sla2 D 768 – 968 , which was not synthetic lethal with either abp1 D or sac6 D . The sla2 D 768 – 968 abp1 D double mutant exhibited no growth defects . However , the sla2 D 768 – 968 sac6 D double mutant exhibited a narrower temperature range permissive for growth than that of the sac6 D single mutant . Although the sac6 D mutant can grow at 34°C , the sla2 D 768 – 968 sac6 D double mutant was un - able to grow at 34°C and grew only poorly at 30°C . This synergistic genetic interaction is striking , because the sla2 D 768 – 968 single mutant is very healthy and exhibits few discernible growth defects . Thus , the functionality provided by both the C - terminal and the N - terminal regions of Sla2p becomes important for viability in the absence of either Abp1p or Sac6p , with the talin - like domain being only partially dispensable . Interaction of Sla2p Domains The Sla2p talin - like domain ( expressed and puriﬁed from E . coli ) binds to actin in vitro ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) and is similar to a domain of talin that binds to actin ( Hemmings et al . , 1996 ) . Therefore , it is not sur - prising that Sla2p D 33 – 750 , which encompasses the talin - like domain , localizes to actin structures in vivo . What is harder to explain is the cytoplasmic localiza - tion of Sla2p D 33 – 501 , which contains the entire talin - like domain plus the 250 amino acids N - terminal to this domain . The presence of the additional 250 amino acids somehow precludes binding of the talin - like do - main to the actin cytoskeleton . This observation could be explained if the 250 – amino acid region directly binds to the talin homology region , thereby occluding its actin localization signal . An alternative possibility is that the mutant protein aberrantly binds to another protein , which then obstructs the actin - binding signal in the talin homology region . Because we had observed that Sla2p residues 503 – 968 expressed and puriﬁed from E . coli do not bind to actin in vitro ( our unpublished results ) , the self - interaction hypothesis was tested . The two - hybrid system was used to test whether different domains of Sla2p could interact with each other . The following Gal4p DNA - binding domain fu - sions were made : Sla2p residues 503 – 968 ( pDD373 ) , 768 – 968 ( pDD374 ) , 751 – 930 ( pDD377 ) , and 5 – 576 ( pDD378 ) . The following Gal4p activation domain fu - sions were also created : Sla2p residues 502 – 767 ( pDD375 ) , 575 – 767 ( pDD376 ) , 5 – 358 ( pDD381 ) , and 5 – 576 ( pDD379 ) . Interactions with actin were also tested using actin fusion proteins . A pair of protein chimeras known to interact with each other , SNF1 ( pSE1112 ) and SNF4 ( pSE1111 ) , were used as a positive control ( Celenza et al . , 1989 ) . All the pair - wise plasmid combinations were tested to determine whether they could activate HIS3 expression ( Figure 6 ) and also acti - vate lacZ expression ( our unpublished results ) . Of the internal Sla2 interactions tested , only Sla2 768 – 968 in combination with Sla2 502 – 767 or Sla2 575 – 767 , as well as Sla2 5 – 578 in combination with Sla2 5 – 578 , were positive ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . Note that amino acids 768 – 968 , but not amino acids 503 – 968 , interacted with amino acids 502 – 767 . This suggests that the binding site for the Sla2 502 – 767 fusion present in Sla2 768 – 968 is occluded in Sla2 503 – 968 . Sla2 503 – 968 is similar to the deletion mutant Sla2p D 33 – 501 , which exhibits cytoplasmic localization in vivo despite containing an actin - binding site . These ob - servations are consistent with the hypothesis that the site in Sla2p that mediates localization to actin is masked in Sla2p D 33 – 501 by an intra - or intermolecular interaction . Furthermore , although Sla2 751 – 930 in combination with Sla2 575 – 767 did not activate HIS3 expression , Sla2 768 – 968 in combination with Sla2 575 – 767 was able to do so ( Figure 6 ) . Therefore , the predicted coiled - coil forming residues 930 – 968 are essential for the associ - ation of the talin - like domain with residues 575 – 767 , which themselves contain a second region of pre - dicted coiled - coil that is evolutionarily conserved ( Figure 1 ) . S . Yang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2276 We also tested the ability of the various Sla2p do - mains to interact with actin in the two - hybrid assay and found that only the talin - like domain ( Sla2 768 – 968 ) was capable of doing so . In addition , residues 930 – 968 ( a predicted coiled - coil region ) were essential for this interaction . This result agrees with the in vitro results of McCann and Craig ( 1997 ) , who found that residue 957 is essential for actin binding . Thus , the same pre - dicted Sla2p coiled - coil region that is necessary for actin binding is also necessary for self - association . No other region of Sla2p , including the construct contain - ing residues 503 – 968 , was capable of interacting with actin in our assay . Finally , we observed that Sla2p fragment 1 – 575 could interact with itself , and that residues 360 – 575 , the central predicted coiled - coil region , are essential for this interaction . A clone containing this coiled - coil domain alone was also retrieved from a two - hybrid library when residues 5 – 576 of Sla2p were used as bait ( our unpublished results ) . Evidence That Sla2p Is a Dimer In Vivo Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) demonstrated that the central coiled - coiled domain of Sla2p mediated the formation of a complex that sediments at ; 220 kDa . This complex might have resulted from dimerization of Sla2p or from the binding of another protein ( s ) to Sla2p . Our two - hybrid analysis showed that this coiled - coil do - main is capable of interacting with itself , suggesting that the 220 - kDa complex might be an Sla2p dimer . To test this result biochemically , Sla2p was tagged with either multiple histidines or multiple myc epitopes ( see Figure 7A ) . Extracts were prepared from diploid Figure 6 . Sla2p two - hybrid interactions . Yeast strain Y190 containing the indicated plasmids was replica plated either onto me - dium containing histidine ( His 1 plates ) , or onto medium lacking histidine and contain - ing 3 - aminotriazole ( His 2 / 3AT plates ) . If the DNA - binding domain fusion protein and DNA activation domain fusion protein interact with each other , the cells are able to grow on media lacking histidine . The Snf1p - Snf4p pair serves as a positive control . Plates were scored for growth after 2 – 3 d of growth at 25°C . Positive interactions were also veriﬁed by detection of lacZ expression ( our unpublished results ) . Sla2p Is Regulated by Intramolecular Interactions Vol . 10 , July 1999 2277 yeast expressing either one copy of 10 - His - Sla2p and one copy of 6 - myc - Sla2 ( DDY1156 ) or two copies of 6 - myc - Sla2 ( DDY1157 ) . From these strains , the His - tagged Sla2p was isolated on a Ni - agarose column ( see Figure 7B ) . Membrane - extracted 10 - His - Sla2p was found to be associated with 6 - myc - Sla2p , indicating that the two tagged versions of Sla2p form a complex with each other in vivo . A similar result was obtained with Sla2p extracted from the cytoplasm . This result , together with the evidence described above , strongly suggests that Sla2p dimerizes in a manner mediated by its central coiled - coil domain . Fractionation of Sla2p and Sla2p N - terminal Deletion Mutants We determined the fractionation proﬁle of some of the actin - binding proteins encoded by genes that when mutated exhibit synthetic lethality with sla2 mutants ( see Figure 8 ) . We performed this analysis to test the possibility that these proteins exist in complexes with Sla2p . Abp1p eluted in fractions ranging from ; 4 . 5 S ( 65 kDa ) to 11 . 3 S , with more protein present in the earlier fractions . Srv2p eluted in fractions ranging from 11 . 3 to 19 . 5 S ( 670 kDa ) , with more protein present in the later fractions . Sac6p eluted as two distinct peaks , one at 4 . 5 S and the other at 19 . 5 S . Because Sla2p D 33 – 750 ( a protein that associates with actin patches and cables ) and Sla2p D 33 – 501 ( a protein with cytoplasmic localization ) showed vastly different cellular localizations when localized by immunoﬂuo - rescence ( Figure 4 ) , the distribution of these mutant proteins was also analyzed by velocity sedimentation ( see Figure 8 ) and gel ﬁltration ( our unpublished re - sults ) . The presence or absence of full - length Sla2p had no effect of the fractionation properties of either deletion mutant ( our unpublished results ) . Sla2p D 33 – 501 sedi - mented at 4 . 5 S ( 66 kDa ) , in accordance with the size of the monomeric protein ( see Figures 3 and 8 ) . Intrigu - ingly , although a portion of Sla2p D 33 – 750 sedimented below 4 . 5 S ( as expected for its monomeric size ) , most of this protein was found at 19 . 5 S , suggesting that it is in a large , ; 670 - kDa complex . ( see Figure 8 ) . Thus , Sla2p D 33 – 750 is present in a signiﬁcantly larger com - plex than the one containing full - length Sla2p ( 220 kDa ) . As described above , two other actin - binding proteins , Sac6p and Srv2p , also sediment at 19 . 5 S . DISCUSSION Yeast cells lacking Sla2p have previously been dem - onstrated to contain a defective actin cytoskeleton , wherein the cortical actin patches are no longer con - centrated at the surface of the bud ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . These cells also exhibit defects in actin - medi - ated functions , such as endocytosis ( Raths et al . , 1993 ) , the bipolar budding pattern ( Yang et al . , 1997 ) , and abnormal post - Golgi secretory vesicle accumulation ( Mulholland et al . , 1997 ) . In this study , we demonstrate that Sla2p is a com - ponent of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . Sla2p local - izes to only a subset of the actin cortical patches , as well as to cortical patches apparently free of actin ( Figure 2 ) , despite containing an actin - binding site ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) . This is in contrast to pre - viously characterized actin - binding proteins , such as Abp1p or coﬁlin , which are present in all actin patches and absent from patches devoid of actin ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ; Moon et al . , 1993 ) . ( These proteins also maintain their actin patch localization even in sla2 D mutant cells [ our unpublished results ] . ) An additional difference is that these actin - binding proteins ( Abp1p and coﬁlin ) became localized to the cytoplasm when cells were treated with the actin - depolymerizing drug latA ( Ay - scough et al . , 1997 ) . In contrast , Sla2p still exhibited cortical localization , and this localization appeared appropriately polarized to one end of the cell in ; 20 % Figure 7 . Sla2p intramolecular interaction in vivo . ( A ) Haploid yeast expressing Sla2p , tagged with multiple histidines , or multiple myc epitopes , were extracted as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS , and the supernatants from high - speed centrifugations were subjected to SDS - PAGE . The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with either anti - Sla2p ( C - terminal anti - body ) or anti - myc antibodies , as shown . The anti - myc antibody detects only the myc - tagged Sla2p and a background band at ; 90 kDa . ( B ) Heterozygous diploid 6myc - SLA2 / 10His - SLA2 yeast ( DDY1556 ) and homozygous diploid 6myc - SLA2 / 6myc - SLA2 yeast ( DDY1557 ) were extracted as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . Solubilized membrane extract was applied to a Ni - agarose column , which binds the histidine - tagged Sla2 ( lane 6 ) but not the myc - tagged Sla2 ( lane 5 ) . The Western blot was probed with anti - Sla2 antibodies . When His - tagged Sla2 from the heterozygous yeast binds to the column ( and is thus lost from the ﬂow - through ; lane 4 ) , myc - tagged Sla2 is brought with it ( lane 6 ) , indicating that Sla2 is capable of complexing with itself in vivo . S . Yang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2278 of the latA - treated cells ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . This and additional observations discussed below suggest that Sla2p interacts with cortical proteins in addition to actin . The colocalization of Sla2p with actin is most evi - dent early in the cell cycle , in unbudded and small - budded cells , suggesting that its interaction with actin might be especially important during these stages and that its localization and functionality is regulated dur - ing the cell cycle . This suggestion is reinforced by the observation that Sla2p is localized almost exclusively to the cytoplasm in stationary phase yeast cells ( our unpublished results ) . A number of hypotheses to ex - plain the observation that Sla2p patches do not always contain actin can be posited . First , Sla2p may play a regulatory role in actin cortical patch formation . For example , Sla2p might help nucleate actin polymeriza - tion or recruit and stabilize the correct components of cortical patches as they initially form ; thus the patches containing Sla2p but no detectable actin may mark the future sites of actin patch formation . This hypothesis is supported by the observation that sla2 D mutants are defective in nucleation of actin assembly in permeabil - ized cells ( Li et al . , 1995 ) . Alternatively , Sla2p may remain behind after an actin patch has been disassem - bled . A third possibility is that the cortical patches that contain Sla2p alone ( compared with those that contain both Sla2p and actin ) constitute separate functional entities . Further studies using differentially colored green ﬂuorescent protein – tagged fusions of Sla2p and actin in living cells might shed light on this issue . To elucidate ﬁrst the function of Sla2p in actin as - sembly and distribution and second to investigate the regulation of Sla2p distribution , we generated eight Sla2p truncation or deletion mutants ( Figures 3 and 5 ) . Previously , Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) had also generated and characterized some Sla2p deletion mutants . They re - ported that only the N - terminal domain ( speciﬁcally residues 114 – 284 ) is required for growth at 37°C , for endocytosis , and for polarized actin . In addition , a portion of the predicted central coiled - coil domain of Sla2p becomes necessary for the above activities when Srv2p is absent from the cell or when the Src homol - ogy 3 domain of Abp1p is deleted . In contrast , the C - terminal talin - like domain of Sla2p was dispensable under all conditions tested . We have created a differ - ent set of deletion proteins ( the only overlapping one is Sla2p D 768 – 968 ) and subjected them to a comple - mentary set of analyses , including actin localization , Sla2p localization , and two - hybrid interactions . These experiments have produced novel insights regarding the regulation and important functional regions of the protein . We found that Sla2p missing large portions of either its N - or C - terminal domain was still largely func - tional . Both Sla2p D 501 – 968 and overexpressed Sla2p D 33 – 359 could fully rescue the temperature sen - sitivity of sla2 D cells and restore the polarized place - ment of the cortical actin patches and endocytosis ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . ( Unlike full - length Sla2p , these mu - tants did not allow growth in the absence of Sac6p or Abp1p and did not restore the bipolar budding pat - tern . ) These Sla2p mutants colocalized with the corti - cal actin patches ( Figure 4 ) . Thus , both the N - and C - terminal domains of Sla2p contain a cortical patch localization signal , and this localization is probably key to the functionality of these Sla2 deletion proteins . In addition , the N terminus of Sla2p seems to localize to the cell cortex independently of actin , because this domain still exhibits partially polarized cortical local - ization in cells lacking ﬁlamentous actin . A closer examination of the indispensable func - tional regions of Sla2p demonstrates that there is a surprising amount of redundancy within Sla2p . As stated above , we observed that either the N or C terminus ( but not both ) of Sla2p can be removed without greatly perturbing its functional activity . These two deletion mutants have in common the central predicted coiled - coil region ( as well as the ﬁrst 32 residues ) . Although we found that a Sla2p deletion mutant entirely lacking this domain ( D 360 – 575 ) exhibited no functional activity , Wesp et al . , Figure 8 . Sedimentation behav - ior of Sla2p and other cytoskeletal proteins . Velocity sedimentation was performed on a wild - type yeast extract using a 3 – 30 % su - crose gradient as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS section . Fractions were immuno - blotted with the indicated anti - bodies . ( For Sla2p , the C - terminal antibody was used . ) Where indi - cated , extracts were derived from sla2 D cells expressing either Sla2p D 33 – 750 or Sla2p D 33 – 501 . The size standards shown are BSA ( 4 . 5 S ) , catalase ( 11 . 3 S ) , and thyroglobulin ( 19 . 5 S ) . Sla2p Is Regulated by Intramolecular Interactions Vol . 10 , July 1999 2279 ( 1997 ) characterized a slightly less complete dele - tion of the predicted coiled - coil domain ( D 376 – 573 ) and found that it was capable of complementing most of the sla2 null mutant’s deﬁciencies . The dif - ferent boundaries likely contributed to the different functionalities of the deletion proteins and could also explain the discrepancy between our observa - tions and those of Wesp et al . ( 1997 ) concerning the importance of the N terminus of Sla2p . Because very few residues of Sla2p were present in all of our active Sla2p deletion proteins , the results of the Sla2p domain analysis suggest that the protein comprises several functional modules . Removal of any one portion causes relatively little perturbation , but more extensive deletion leads to loss of function . The basic requirements for Sla2p function would appear to be 1 ) a cortical localization signal and 2 ) an additional domain , perhaps for contacting another constituent of the cortical patches . In addition , every deletion mutation we made re - sulted in some loss of function . For example , we ob - served that removal of the C - terminal talin homology region of Sla2p had little effect on the actin cytoskel - eton or cell growth under optimal conditions ( Figures 3 and 4 ) , consistent with the results reported by Wesp et al . , ( 1997 ) . At 37°C , however , we observed that the actin cytoskeleton had fainter cables and chunkier cortical patches if the talin - like domain was deleted ( our unpublished results ) . In addition , this truncation mutation showed a synthetic negative synergism with a sac6 D mutant ( causing inviability at 34°C ) . Intrigu - ingly , expression of the C - terminal talin homology Figure 9 . Model of Sla2p regulation and inter - actions . Sla2p exists in the cytoplasm and asso - ciated with cortical actin patches . Localization to the cortex is probably necessary for activity . Based on the N - terminal deletion and C - termi - nal truncation analysis of Sla2p , both termini of the protein contain a cortical actin patch local - ization signal . The unknown proteins that me - diate Sla2p’s cortical patch localization are de - noted X and Y . The C terminus has been demonstrated to contain an actin - binding site , so Y might be actin . The large , central coiled - coil domain potentially interacts with other proteins ( Z ) . Indeed , Rvs167p has been reported to bind this domain of Sla2p in two - hybrid studies ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . Rvs167 binds to Abp1p , which itself binds to Srv2p and to actin . When expressed alone , however , the coiled - coil do - main is cytoplasmic , and thus this link seems to be insufﬁcient for Sla2p localization . Regulation of the distribution and function of Sla2p could potentially be accomplished through interaction with any of a number of proteins . We have shown , however , that the actin - binding site lo - cated in the C - terminal talin - like domain is likely to be inactivated through a self - associa - tion with the upstream small coiled - coil domain of the protein . This interaction may also be suf - ﬁcient to block the N - terminal and coiled - coil domain binding sites for proteins X and Z , as shown ii , or additional switches and signals may be involved , as depicted in i . S . Yang et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2280 region ( Sla2p D 33 – 750 ) by itself resulted in a dominant phenotype . Cells appeared to exhibit more ﬁlamen - tous actin structures , larger and more abundant actin cortical patches , and thick actin cables ( Figure 4 ) . Thus , the Sla2p talin homology domain may promote actin polymerization or stabilize F - actin structures . Consistent with the observations that the Sla2p talin - like domain pellets with F - actin ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) , we found that this domain interacts with actin in the two - hybrid system ( Figure 6 ) . However , as assayed through the two - hybrid sys - tem , no other region of Sla2p exhibited an interac - tion with actin , supporting the view that Sla2p makes actin - dependent and independent interac - tions with the cell cortex . Furthermore , a construct containing an additional 265 amino acids N - termi - nal of the talin - like domain did not interact with actin , suggesting that the actin - binding site may be masked , somehow , in this construct . High overexpression of the Sla2p talin - like domain results in death in sla2 D cells . In contrast , overexpres - sion of full - length Sla2p , or of a large C - terminal frag - ment of Sla2p ( Sla2p D 33 – 501 ) , has no detectable dom - inant effect on cell growth or on the actin cytoskeleton . The excess Sla2p appears to be mainly cytoplasmic and not present in cortical patches , as judged by indi - rect immunoﬂuorescence ( our unpublished results ) . These results suggest that sequences N - terminal to the talin homology domain may be able to mask the talin - like region of Sla2p , through either a direct inter - or intramolecular interaction ( see Figure 9 ) . There are precedents in which intramolecular interactions affect the accessibility of functional domains in other cy - toskeletal proteins , including vinculin , a component of focal adhesions , and ezrin , a membrane - cytoskeletal linking protein . The N - terminal domains of ezrin and vinculin bind to their C - terminal domains , thereby masking an F - actin – binding sites ( Gary and Bretscher , 1995 ; Johnson and Craig , 1994 , 1995 ) . Phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate , which is also thought to regu - late cytoskeletal proteins , such as proﬁlin ( Lassing and Lindberg , 1985 ) , can disrupt vinculin self - association , thus exposing its talin - and actin - binding sites ( Gil - more and Burridge , 1996 ) . In support for a model invoking regulation of Sla2p association with the cell cortex via intramo - lecular interaction , we found using the two - hybrid system that the C - terminal talin homology domain of Sla2p binds speciﬁcally to the 250 - residue seg - ment immediately upstream of it ( Figure 6 ) . This interaction is dependent on Sla2p residues 930 – 968 and on residues 567 – 767 , both of which contain evolutionarily conserved domains that are pre - dicted to form alpha - helical coiled coils . As men - tioned above , residues 930 – 968 are also necessary for actin binding . Thus , Sla2p can self - associate , and this self - association is predicted to mask the actin - binding site ( see Figure 9 ) . How the Sla2p intramo - lecular ( or intermolecular ) interactions may be reg - ulated has not yet been investigated . Sla2p is phosphorylated ( our unpublished results ) , and this provides one potential means of regulation . The large central coiled - coil region mediates Sla2p dimerization ( Figure 7 ) . Dimerization may be neces - sary for full functionality . In addition , the central coiled - coil domain might interact with other cytoskel - etal proteins ; this region has been shown to interact with Rvs167p using the two - hybrid system ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) . Speciﬁc interaction between the putative alpha - helical coiled - coil regions of one protein with another protein has been reported previously ( Spencer et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , the Sla2p human homologue Hip1p binds to huntingtin , the protein whose muta - tion results in HD , and this interaction is mediated by the conserved central putative coiled - coil region of Hip1p ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ) . Crude fractionation of yeast extract suggested that the majority of Sla2p is present in a large , membrane - associated complex ( Figure 8 ) . Fractionation of wild - type yeast extract on a sucrose gradient showed that full - length Sla2p sediments at 11 . 3 S , which corre - sponds to ; 220 kDa ( assuming a globularly shaped protein ) . The talin homology region , however , sedi - mented at 19 . 5 S ( 670 kDa ) . Two other cortical cy - toskeletal proteins , Sac6p and Srv2p , also sediment at 19 . 5 S . Intriguingly , null alleles of all three genes , SLA2 , SAC6 , and SRV2 , are synthetically lethal with each other . Thus , the 19 . 5 S complex might contain all three proteins , providing internal functional redun - dancy , and represent a subunit or a building block of a “cortical patch . ” Sla2p presumably contacts other proteins to pro - mulgate its effects ( shown as X , Y , and Z in Figure 9 ) . Because the N - and C - terminal regions are indepen - dently capable of localization to cortical patches , they both must interact with cortically located components . Furthermore , because the majority of Sla2p is localized to the cytoplasm in stationary ( G o ) cultures , or when Sla2p is overexpressed , negative regulation and / or the requirement for a positive signal must occur at both termini . From our results , we believe that the switch at the C - terminus involves inhibition of self - association mediated by the two small predicted coiled - coil domains of Sla2p . Whether this interaction also regulates the N - terminal binding is unknown ; however , this is unlikely because in the absence of the C terminus , the protein still seems to be correctly localized and functional . It is possible that a number of signals and switches are involved . Additionally , the binding partners for Sla2p might themselves be targets of regulation , providing an indirect method of regu - lating Sla2p distribution .
