A number of results suggest that phosphorylation of the conserved TEDS serine of the myosin I motor head by the Cdc42p activated p21 - activated kinases Ste20p and Cla4p is required for the orga - nization of the actin cytoskeleton . However , the role of this sig - naling cascade in the endocytic uptake has not been investigated . Interestingly , we find that Myo5p TEDS site phosphorylation is not required for slow , constitutive endocytosis of Ste2p , but it is essential for rapid , ligand - induced internalization of the recep - tor . Our results strongly suggest that a kinase activates the myo - sins I to sustain fast endocytic uptake . Surprisingly , however , despite the fact that only p21 - activated kinases are known to phosphorylate the conserved TEDS site , we find that these kinases are not essential for ligand - induced internalization of Ste2p . Our observations indicate that a different signaling cas - cade , involving the yeast homologues of the mammalian PDK1 ( 3 - phosphoinositide - dependent - protein kinase - 1 ) , Phk1p and Pkh2p , and serum and glucocorticoid - induced kinase , Ypk1p and Ypk2p , activate Myo3p and Myo5p for their endocytic function . Myosins I constitute a well characterized and ubiquitous group of unconventional myosins , which participate in a variety of cellular pro - cesses , including endocytosis , phagocytosis , cell motility , secretion , and cell polarity ( 1 , 2 ) . As other myosins , myosins I bear an N - terminal actin - activated ATPase , which can translocate actin filaments in vitro ( 3 ) . A short positively charged tail that binds acidic phospholipids and targets the myosin to the appropriate cellular membranes follows the conserved motor domain ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ) . The fungal and the protozoal myo - sins I bear an additional C - terminal extension that participates in the activation of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization ( 6 – 10 ) . In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , two highly homologous genes encode myosins I : MYO3 and MYO5 . Deletion of either gene does not result in anyobviousphenotype , whereas , dependingonthestrainbackground , a double knock - out is lethal or very sick , suggesting functional redun - dancy ( 11 , 12 ) . Genetic analysis indicates that the yeast myosins I par - ticipate in the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and in endocytosis . Cortical actin patches , which concentrate in the daughter cells in wild type budding yeast , partially redistribute to mother cells in a double myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) null mutant generated in a permissive strain background ( 11 , 12 ) . Besides , Myo3p and Myo5p have a well established function in the ligand - induced internalization of the (cid:1) - factor pheromone receptor Ste2p . Ste2p is a G protein - coupled receptor that triggers the mating response in the presence of (cid:1) - factor ( 13 ) . Binding of the pheromone to its receptor accelerates its internalization and degradation rate as part of a pheromone desensitization program ( 14 ) . Temperature - sensitive myosin I mutants are blocked in their capacity to internalize radioac - tively labeled (cid:1) - factor immediately upon a shift to restrictive tempera - ture ( 11 , 12 ) . The endocytic (cid:1) - factor uptake requires the most C - termi - nal domain of the myosins I , which participates in the induction of Arp2 / 3 - dependentactinpolymerization ( 8 ) , anditmightalsorequireits motor activity ( 12 ) . A number of results suggest that the actin - activated ATPase of the protozoal and the fungal myosins I is induced by phosphorylation of a conservedserineorthreoninepositionedonasurfaceloopthatcontacts the actin filament ( 15 ) . Phosphorylation of this residue induces a con - formational change that accelerates phosphate release during ATP hydrolysis in vitro ( 16 ) . The unconventional mammalian myosins VI also bear a serine or a threonine at this position , and therefore , they might also be regulated by phosphorylation ( 2 ) . Other myosins have a glutamate or an aspartate at this site , suggesting that a negative charge is required there for full myosin ATPase activity ( 17 ) . Because only thre - onine , glutamate , aspartate , or serine is present at this position in the myosin motor domain , this site is named the TEDS site ( 17 ) . A number of results illustrate the physiological relevance of the myo - sin I TEDS site phosphorylation . In vivo phosphorylation of this residue has been demonstrated for the protozoal myosins I ( 18 , 19 ) , and muta - tion of the TEDS site to alanine of the Dictyostelium myoB results in a protein unable to complement a double myoA (cid:2) / myoB (cid:2) null mutant ( 20 , 21 ) . Consistently , the yeast MYO3 TEDS site serine to alanine mutant ( myo3 - S357A ) fails to complement the synthetic lethal pheno - type of a double myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) null strain ( 20 , 21 ) . Interestingly , how - ever , not all fungal myosin I functions require phosphorylation of this residue and / or full ATPase activity , since a TEDS site to alanine muta - tion in the Aspergillus nidulans MYOA only causes slight defects when compared with the null mutation ( 22 , 23 ) . * This work was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Grants SFB 352 and Grossgera¨teinitiative and Ministero de Ciencia y Tecnologı´a Grant SAF2002 - 04707 .

PAKs are ubiquitous kinases activated by acidic phospholipids and by the small Rho - like GTPases Cdc42 and Rac ( 24 – 30 ) . Among many cel - lular tasks , PAKs participate in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the development of cell polarity ( 31 ) . Three genes encode PAKs expressed during vegetative growth in yeast : STE20 , CLA4 , and SKM1 . Deletion of STE20 and CLA4 within the same cell is synthetically lethal , suggesting that they share an essen - tial function ( 28 , 32 – 35 ) . The cellular role of the third PAK Skm1p is still unknown ( 36 ) . Numerous results demonstrate that the yeast myosins I are targets of the Cdc42p - activated PAKs controlling actin assembly and polarization ( see Ref . 37 and references therein ) . Cla4p and Ste20p phosphorylate the Myo3p TEDS site in vitro ( 21 ) , and , most strikingly , a Myo3p bearing a TEDS serine to aspartate substi - tution ( Myo3 - S357Dp ) suppresses the actin depolarization defects of a cdc42 - 1 mutant ( 9 ) . In the present work , we have investigated the role of the yeast myosin I TEDS site phosphorylation in the endocytic uptake . Interestingly , we find that myosin I phosphorylation is required for fast , ligand - induced internalization of Ste2p but not for slow , constitutive endocytosis of the receptor . Further , we show that a Myo5p mutant that mimics the TEDS site phosphorylated state significantly accelerates constitutive Ste2p internalization . Our results suggest that activation of the myosin I ATPase can control the endocytic uptake rate in yeast and that a kinase or kinases activate the myosins I to sustain fast internalization . Surpris - ingly , although only PAKs are known to phosphorylate the conserved myosin TEDS site , we found that sustained activity of Cdc42p and the yeast PAKs Ste20p , Cla4p , and Skm1p is dispensable for (cid:1) - factor - in - duced Ste2p internalization . Our results suggest that a different signal - ing cascade that involves the yeast PDK1 ( 3 - phosphoinositide - depend - ent protein kinase - 1 ) and serum and glucocorticoid - induced kinase ( SGK ) homologues ( Pkh1 / 2p and Ypk1 / 2p , respectively ) activates Myo3p and Myo5p for their endocytic function .

Beads were washed with IPT and IP , and Myo5p was released with 10 units / ml TEV protease ( Invitrogen ) in 50 m M Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 0 . 5 m M EDTA for 2 h at 16 °C . Myo5p was eluted from the beads in the presence of 0 . 5 M NaCl . Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS - polyacrylamide gel of IgG - Sepharose precipitates from yeast expressing ProtA - Myo5p demonstrated the presence of two polypep - tides of (cid:4) 130 and 150 kDa ( Fig . 1 C ) that could be decorated with rabbit PAP ( anti - peroxidase antibodies raised in rabbits with horseradish per - oxidase ; DAKO ) ( data not shown ) . TEV protease digestion of the beads released 132 - and 116 - kDa polypeptides ( Fig . 1 C ) that most likely cor - respondtothefull - lengthMyo5pandatruncatedformlackinga16 - kDa C - terminal polypeptide ( 8 ) . Consistently , the upper but not the lower band was recognized by an anti - Myo5p polyclonal antibody raised against the C - terminal portion of the protein ( data not shown ) ( 44 ) . For MALDI - TOF analysis , purified protein was separated in a 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel , and (cid:4) 5 (cid:2) g of ProtA - Myo5p was sliced from the gel . Protein bands were digested in gel with trypsin ( Promega ) , and phosphopeptides were enriched using Ga 3 (cid:5) IMAC minispin col - umns ( Pierce ) . Peptides from in - gel digests were adjusted to 10 % acetic acid and incubated with the beads of a minicolumn for 10 min at room temperature . The columns were washed with 0 . 1 % acetic acid , pH 3 , and 0 . 1 % acetic acid , 10 % acetonitrile , pH 3 , to remove nonspe - cifically bound peptides . Bound peptides were eluted with 150 m M ammonium bicarbonate , pH 9 . For MALDI - TOF analysis ( 48 ) , the IMAC - enriched samples were eluted from (cid:2) C18 ZipTips ( Millipore ) directly onto the sample plate with 1 (cid:2) l of 5 mg / ml (cid:1) - cyano - 4 - hydroxy - cinnamicacidin50 % acetonitrile , 3 % formicacidandwerethenoverlaid with 1 (cid:2) l of 25 m M ammonium citrate solution to enhance the ioniza - tion efficiency of phosphopeptides . Positive ion mass spectra were acquired on a Reflex III ( Bruker Daltonik ) for peptide mass determina - tion or on an Ultraflex TOF / TOF ( Bruker Daltonik ) for peptide frag - mentation analysis by PSD / LIFT . RESULTS The Myo5p TEDS Site Is Phosphorylated in Vivo —Despite all data supporting the physiological relevance of the myosins I TEDS site phos - phorylation , phosphorylation at this position in vivo has only been dem - onstrated for the protozoal myosins I ( 18 , 19 ) . Since some of the fungal myosins I do not require phosphorylation to fulfill their cellular tasks ( 22 , 23 ) , we decided to first investigate if the S . cerevisiae Myo5p TEDS site was phosphorylated in vivo . In order to address this matter , the wild type Myo5p or a mutant bearing a TEDS serine to alanine substitution ( Myo5 - S357Ap ) was immunoprecipitated from 32 PO 43 (cid:2) - radiolabeled yeast cells . An equivalent phosphorylation signal could be detected for samplesexpressingthewildtypeandmutantMyo5p . Nosignalcouldbe detected when the anti - Myo5p antibody was omitted in the immuno - precipitation or when the proteins were immunoprecipitated from cells lacking MYO5 ( Fig . 1 A ) . Interestingly , C - terminal truncation of Myo5p resulted in loss of the radioactive signal ( Fig . 1 B ) , suggesting that if the Myo5p TEDS site was phosphorylated , phosphorylation requires an intact Myo5p tail . To further investigate if the Myo5p TEDS site was phosphorylated in vivo , we purified it from yeast expressing a Protein A N - terminal tagged version of MYO5 ( PROTA - MYO5 ) ( Fig . 1 C and “Materials and Methods” ) . ProtA - Myo5pwastrypsin - digestedingel , andphosphopep - tides were enriched by IMAC . MALDI - TOF analysis of the IMAC elu - ate revealed peptides with masses of 1022 . 48 , 1178 . 68 , 1917 . 93 , and 2074 . 2 that correlated with the masses of the tryptic monophospho - rylated Myo5p peptides 775 – 782 , 774 – 782 , 356 – 372 , and 355 – 372 , respectively ( Fig . 1 D ) . Fragmentation by PSD confirmed the identity of these peptides and revealed Ser 357 and Ser 777 as the sites of phosphoryl - ation ( Fig . 1 E and data not shown ) . Phosphorylation of the Yeast Myosin I TEDS Site Is Required for the Organization of the Actin Cytoskeleton —Experimental evidence from Wu and co - workers ( 21 ) demonstrated that mutation of the Myo3p TEDS serine to alanine results in a protein ( Myo3 - S357Ap ) that cannot complement the lethality of a double myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) knock - out , indicat - ing that phosphorylation of the TEDS site might be required for at least the essential myosin I function in yeast . However , instability or mislo - calization of the protein might have caused the loss of function in these experiments . On the other hand , the contribution of the TEDS site phosphorylation to any particular myosin I function could not be exam - ined under these circumstances . Interestingly , we found that the anal - ogous mutation in MYO5 ( MYO5 - S357A ) could indeed complement the lethality of the myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) double knock ( Fig . 2 A ) , although it caused a temperature - sensitive growth defect ( Fig . 2 B ) . This result is consistent with our previous observations suggesting that Myo5p plays a predominant role in the cell when compared with Myo3p ( 12 ) . No growth defect could be detected when the serine 357 was mutated to a negative charged amino acid ( myo5 - S357E ) ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . This result demonstrated that the unphosphorylated myosin I is sufficient to sus - tain growth , at least under optimal conditions . To investigate if TEDS site phosphorylation was required for the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton , myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357A cells were grown at permissive temperature ( 23 °C ) , fixed , and stained with TEDS Site Phosphorylation of Myo5p APRIL 21 , 2006• VOLUME 281•NUMBER 16 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 11107 a t B i b li o t heque F a c u l t e M ede c i ne G ene v e on M a y 3 1 , 2007 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m TRITC - phalloidin to visualize filamentous actin . Almost 80 % of the myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357A small budded yeast cells exhibited a clearly depo - larized actin cytoskeleton with more than two actin patches present at themothercells ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Underthesameconditions , only1 % of small budded yeast expressing the wild type Myo5p presented a depo - larizedcytoskeleton ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Theseresultssuggestedthatphos - phorylation of the myosin I TEDS site is required to sustain a properly polarized actin cytoskeleton in yeast . Interestingly , nearly 30 % of the small budded myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357E cells also exhibited a depolarized cytoskeleton ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) , suggesting that dephosphorylation of the TEDS site is also required for an accurate cytoskeletal organization . Phosphorylation of the Myosin I TEDS Site Is Required for Ligand - induced but Not for Constitutive Internalization of Ste2p —To investi - gate if the myosin I endocytic function also requires TEDS site phos - phorylation , we examined the kinetics of constitutive and ligand - induced endocytosis of Ste2p ( 14 ) in cells expressing the Myo5p TEDS site mutants as the only source of myosin I ( myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357E and myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357A ) . As shown in Fig . 3 A , the myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357A strain exhibited a strong defect in its capacity to internalize Ste2p in the presence of (cid:1) - factor when compared with cells expressing the wild type Myo5p . Strikingly , however , constitutive internalization of the receptor appeared unaffected in these cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . The prominent (cid:1) - factor uptake defect installed in the myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357A strain was not the result of cell sickness , since biosynthetic transport and maturation of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y ( 43 ) was unaffected ( Fig . 3 C ) . Further , immunoblot analysis of the wild type and the mutant Myo5p ( Fig . 4 A ) and confocal fluorescence microscopy of strains expressing green fluorescent protein - tagged versions of these proteins demon - FIGURE 1 .

These data indicated that TEDS site phospho - rylation of the myosin I is required in yeast for fast , ligand - induced internalization of Ste2p but not for its slow , constitutive uptake . Inter - estingly , we also found that cells expressing the Myo5p mutant mimick - ing the phosphorylated state ( myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357E ) displayed a slight but significant acceleration of the constitutive Ste2p uptake kinetics when compared with cells expressing the wild type Myo5p ( Fig . 3 B ) . This result suggested that phosphorylation of the myosin I TEDS site can control the endocytic uptake rate , possibly through activation of the myosinIATPase . Noaccelerationcouldbedetected , however , whenthe internalization assay was done in the presence of the pheromone ( Fig . 3 A ) . Other endocytic factors might limit the fast ligand - induced Ste2p internalization rate . Actually , although the initial uptake kinetics of the myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357E strain was nearly identical to that of the wild type , mutant cells only managed to internalize 70 % of the total cell - bound (cid:1) - factor as opposed to 100 % for cells expressing wild type Myo5p ( Fig . 3 A ) . Depletion of the available endocytic machinery in cells with con - stitutively accelerated endocytosis or excessive recycling of Ste2p to the plasma membrane could account for the observed phenotype in the myo3 (cid:1) myo5 - S357E cells ( 49 ) . Sustained Cdc42p Signaling through the PAKs Is Not Essential for Ligand - induced Ste2p Internalization —Our data demonstrated that TEDS site phosphorylation was necessary not only for the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton but also for ligand - induced Ste2p internaliza - tion .

TEDS Site Phosphorylation of Myo5p APRIL 21 , 2006• VOLUME 281•NUMBER 16 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 11109 a t B i b li o t heque F a c u l t e M ede c i ne G ene v e on M a y 3 1 , 2007 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m sin TEDS site , we decided to investigate if the Cdc42p / PAK / myosin I signaling pathway , which is required in yeast to polarize the actin cytoskeleton , also functioned to activate Myo3p and Myo5p for their endocytic function . For that purpose , we first created a temperature - sensitive kinase - dead PAK mutant by deleting the chromosomal genes encoding SKM1 and STE20 and by introducing a H685Y mutation in a highly conserved residue of the CLA4 core kinase domain ( 50 ) . As expected , the cla4 - H685Y ste20 (cid:1) skm1 (cid:1) strain ( pak - ts ) was tempera - ture - sensitive for growth ( Fig . 5 B ) . At permissive temperature ( 24 °C ) , the growth rate of pak - ts cells was comparable with the wild type ( Fig . 5 B ) , althoughsomeofthemutantcellspresentedelongatedbudssimilar to those described in the cla4 - 75 ste20 (cid:1) mutant ( Fig . 5 C ) ( 33 ) . Upon a 30 - min shift to 37 °C , pak - ts cells stopped dividing and adopted a round morphology analogous to that described for other cla4 ste20 mutants at this temperature ( Fig . 5 C ) ( 35 , 42 ) . Also , consistent with previous pub - lications ( 35 , 42 ) , our pak - ts mutant was unable to repolarize its actin cytoskeletonatelevatedtemperature ( Fig . 5 , D and E ) . Inwildtypeyeast , heat stress causes rapid depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton , which only recovers 2 – 3 h after prolonged incubation at elevated temperature ( 51 ) . Our results demonstrated that a temperature shift to 37 °C tightly inactivated the Cla4 - H685Yp in vivo . To investigate if PAKs were required to sustain ligand - induced Ste2p internalization , we performed an (cid:1) - factor uptake assay using the cla4 - H685Y ste20 (cid:1) skm1 (cid:1) mutant upon a shift to restrictive temperature . Surprisingly , upon 30 - min preincubation at 37 °C , the (cid:1) - factor internalization kinetics of the mutant cells was identical to that of the wild type ( Fig . 5 F ) . In addition , we failed to detect any (cid:1) - factor uptake defect in yeast strains bearing four different cdc42 mutations ( cdc42 - 1 , cdc42 - 118 , cdc42 - 123 , and cdc42 - 129 ) ( Fig . 6 ) that are known to specifically interfere with Cdc42p signaling to the PAKs ( 52 ) . Most strikingly , the cdc42 - 1 mutation that specifically hinders the signaling pathway to the myosins I ( 9 ) did not alter the (cid:1) - factor uptake kinetics at restrictive temperature . Additional pre - incubation at restrictive temperature of the pak - ts and cdc42 mutants resulted in very low (cid:1) - factor binding to the cells , maybe reflecting a defect in Ste2p traffic to the plasma membrane ( 53 , 54 ) . To further inspect the endocytic uptake phenotype of a conditional pak mutant under the very same experimental circumstances that clearly installed an actin polarity defect , we decided to use a chemically sensitive CLA4 allele , cla4 - as3 ( 42 ) . The Cla4 - as3p bears two mutations that enlarge the ATP binding pocket of the kinase without significantly affecting its activity in vivo ( 42 ) . These mutations allow binding of the membrane - permeable pyrimidine analogue 1NM - PP1 , which can then efficiently and specifically inactivate the Cla4 - as3p kinase ( 42 ) . It was previously shown that the in vivo activity of Cla4 - as3p is inhibited upon 1 - h incubation in the presence of 25 (cid:2) M 1NM - PP1 ( 42 ) . Under the same conditions , nouptakedefectwasobservedinthe ste20 (cid:1) skm1 (cid:1) cla4 - as3 ( pak - as3 ) mutantwhencomparedwithawildtypeoranisogenic ste20 (cid:1) skm1 (cid:1) CLA4 strain ( data not shown ) . Further , increasing the concen - tration of 1NM - PP1 to 100 (cid:2) M did not alter the internalization kinetics of the conditional pak - as3 mutant ( Fig . 7 A ) . In contrast to the uptake kinetics , the actin distribution in the 100 (cid:2) M 1NM - PP1 - treated pak - as3 cells was similar to that observed in the myo3 (cid:1) myo5S357A strain FIGURE 4 .

Upon 1 - h incubation in the presence of the drug , pak - as3 cells appeared big and round , and more than 80 % of the small budded yeast exhibited a depolarized actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 7 , B and C ) . This terminal phenotype was strikingly different from that previ - ously described for the ste20 (cid:1) cla4 - as3 double mutant ( 42 ) . Deletion of SKM1 and / or treatment of the cells with a higher 1NM - PP1 concentra - tion may account for the observed differences . The actin and morphol - ogy defects installed in the pak - as3 cells were dependent on the pres - ence of the cla4 - as3 mutation and the drug , since they did not appear in the mock - treated pak - as3 strain or in the 1NM - PP1 - treated ste20 (cid:1) skm1 (cid:1) CLA4 cells ( Fig . 7 , B and C ) . The data strongly indicated that ligand - induced endocytosis of Ste2p is not abolished under conditions that tightly block the Cdc42p - activated PAK signaling pathway , and the data suggested that kinases other than PAKs can also activate the myosins I for their endocytic function . A Signaling Cascade Involving the Yeast Homologues of the Mamma - lian PDK1 and SGK Might Activate the Myosins I for Their Endocytic Function —Searching for proteins required for ligand - induced Ste2p internalization that might physically and genetically interact with the myosins I , we found the essential and functionally redundant Pkh1p and Pkh2p , the yeast homologues of the mammalian PDK1 ( 55 ) . Sphingoid base - activated Pkh1p and Pkh2p are thought to initiate a signaling cas - cade that modulates the endocytic uptake in yeast ( 55 ) . Interestingly , we found that deletion of the chromosomal copy of MYO5 caused a syn - thetic growth defect in the temperature - sensitive pkh1 - ts pkh2 (cid:1) strain ( 55 ) ( Fig . 8 A ) . The synthetic growth defect could not be observed when MYO5 was deleted in other mutant backgrounds with similar growth and uptake defects ( 8 ) , suggesting an intimate functional interaction between the myosins I and the yeast PDK1 homologues . In agreement with this view , we also observed a physical interaction between Pkh1p and Pkh2p and the Myo5p head and tail domains in a two - hybrid assay ( Fig . 8 B ) . These interactions seemed to be specific , since we could not observe significant transcriptional activation of the (cid:3) - galactosidase reporter when we tested interactions between the Myo5p fragments and other kinases involved in endocytosis ( Prk1p and Yck1p ( 56 , 57 ) ) ( Fig . 8 B ) . The yeast Pkh1p and Pkh2p and the mammalian PDK1 are known to activate a number of downstream kinases that bear a consensus motif ( Thr - Phe - Cys - Gly - Thr - X - Glu - Tyr , where Thr is the phosphorylable residue and X is any amino acid ) . Such kinases include members of the protein kinase C , protein kinase A , and SGK families ( 58 – 61 ) . Pkh1p and Pkh2p are also able to phosphorylate in vitro the yeast Pkc1p ( pro - teinkinaseC ) andthefunctionallyredundanthighlysimilarSGKhomo - logues Ypk1p and Ypk2p ( Fig . 8 C ) ( 55 , 62 – 64 ) . The Myo3p and Myo5p TEDS site does not match the PDK1 consensus motif . Therefore , we suspected that these molecular motors might not be direct targets of Pkh1p and Pkh2p . These kinases might rather work to recruit and to activate the actual TEDS site kinase . To identify kinases that might mediate between Pkh1 / 2p and the myosins I , we searched for synthetic interactions between the myo5 (cid:1) null mutation and mutations in genes encoding the known Pkh1 / 2p targets Pkc1p , Ypk1p , and Ypk2p ( pkc1 - ts ( 55 , 63 , 64 ) , ypk1 (cid:1) , and ypk2 (cid:1) ) . Interestingly , although we failed to observe synthetic growth defects in the double mutants , we detected a strong and a mild synthetic (cid:1) - factor uptake defect when MYO5 was deleted in the ypk2 (cid:1) and ypk1 (cid:1) backgrounds , respectively . The syn - thetic uptake defect observed in the ypk2 myo5 mutants could still be observed when the myo5 (cid:1) null mutation was substituted with the myo5 - S357A point mutation , thus suggesting that the lack of Ypk2p interfered with the Myo5p ATPase function .

TEDS Site Phosphorylation of Myo5p APRIL 21 , 2006• VOLUME 281•NUMBER 16 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 11111 a t B i b li o t heque F a c u l t e M ede c i ne G ene v e on M a y 3 1 , 2007 www . j b c . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m defects were observed when the myo5 (cid:1) mutation was combined with a pkc1 - ts mutation or with a partial loss of function mutation in another gene required for early events in the endocytic uptake ( sla2 - n ) ( Fig . 9 ) . These results suggested that the yeast homologues of the mammalian SGK and Myo5p functionally cooperate in the endocytic uptake of Ste2p . Consistent with this view , we found that Ypk2p and , to a lesser extent , Ypk1pinteractedwithMyo5pinthetwo - hybridassay ( Fig . 10 A ) . No significant activation of the reporter was triggered when Pkc1p was used in the assay ( Fig . 10 A ) . To test if Ypk2p or Ypk1p directly and specifically phosphorylate the Myo5p TEDS site , an in vitro kinase assay was performed using purified components . For that purpose , a recombinant purified Myo5p fragment fused to GST bearing the TEDS site ( amino acids 322 – 391 ) ( GST - TEDS ) was incubated in the presence of [ (cid:4) - 32 P ] ATP and purified Ypk2p or Ypk1p fused to GST . In the presence of Ypk2p , the TEDS construct was covalently labeled with radioactive phos - phate ( Fig . 10 B ) . Phosphorylation occurred in the TEDS serine , since mutation of the Myo5p Ser 357 to alanine or glutamic acid completely abrogated transfer of the phosphate to the TEDS construct ( Fig . 10 B ) . Further , MALDI - TOF signals that correspond to masses of phosphorylated GSVYHVPLNIVQADAVR ( 1917 , 64 ) and RGSVYH - VPLNIVQADAVR ( 2073 . 72 ) , could be detected in samples treated with GST - Ypk2p but not in untreated samples ( Fig . 10 C ) . An extra band probably corresponding to the autophosphorylated Ypk2p could also be observed on the autoradiography of all samples con - taining this kinase . Neither autophosphorylation nor TEDS phos - phorylation could be detected in the samples containing purified Ypk1p ( Fig . 10 B ) , suggesting that this kinase might not be active under the conditions assayed . TEDS site phosphorylation in the presence of purified GST - Ypk2p required an active enzyme , since mutation of conserved residues in the kinase domain ( His 459 and Lys 373 ) ( 50 , 65 ) completely abolished the phosphorylation of the Myo5p TEDS site ( Fig . 10 B ) . All of these data strongly indicated that kinases other than PAKs can also phosphorylate the conserved myosin I TEDS site . Further , the results suggested that the yeast myosins I are targets of the Pkh1 / 2p and Ypk1 / 2p signaling cascade that modulates endocytosis in yeast . DISCUSSION TEDS Site Phosphorylation of the Myosins I and the Control of the Endocytic Uptake Rate in Yeast —Our results demonstrated that a mutant Myo5p mimicking the constitutively TEDS site - dephosphoryl - ated isoform ( Myo5 - S357Ap ) was unable to rescue the actin polariza - tion defects of a myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) double knock - out . In addition , the mutant failed to sustain fast , ligand - induced internalization of the (cid:1) - factor receptor Ste2p . Since the mutant was stable and it was properly localized , the data indicated that TEDS site phosphorylation is required for at least two myosin I functions in budding yeast . These observations are in striking agreement with the results from Novak and Titus ( 20 ) showing that substitution of the Dictyostelium discoideum myoB TEDS FIGURE8 .

However , in agreement with what was demonstrated for the A . nidulans MYOA ( 22 , 23 ) , we also found that phosphorylation of the myosins I was not essential to sustain slow con - stitutive endocytosis . Also in agreement with the results in A . nidulans ( 66 ) , we found that the basal ATPase activity of the unphosphorylated myosin I might be rate - limiting in this process , since mutants that mim - icked the phosphorylated state significantly accelerate constitutive endocytosis . Since Myo5p TEDS site phosphorylation is essential for rapid (cid:1) - factor - induced internalization of Ste2p , our results suggest that fungi can use TEDS site phosphorylation and dephosphorylation to control the endocytic uptake rate in response to intracellular or extra - cellular signals . Two simple models might explain the observation that myosin I TEDS sitephosphorylationisrequiredforligand - inducedbutnotforconstitutive internalization of Ste2p . In the first model , a slow and a fast endocytic pathway would co - exist , only the last one being sustained by the phospho - rylatedmyosinsI . LigandbindingmightthensimplytargetSte2ptothefast endocytic pathway . A second model to explain the observed results would propose that certain intracellular or extracellular signals might be able to modulate the endocytic uptake rate by inducing signaling cascades that phosphorylate and activate Myo3p and Myo5p . Interestingly , modulation of TEDS site phosphorylation by extracellular signals have been described in D . discoideum . In this organism , treatment with the chemoattractant cAMP causes a transient 3 - fold increase in the amount of myoB phospho - rylated at the TEDS site ( 19 ) . Analysis of this possibility will now require careful inspection of the Myo5p TEDS site phosphorylation state under conditions that induce endocytosis . Unfortunately , this is not a trivial experiment , giventhat , incontrasttothe D . discoideummyoB ( 19 ) , Myo5p isphosphorylatedatothersitesbesidesserine357 ( Fig . 1 ) , andtheexpected increase in the amount of the phosphorylated isoform might be subtle and transient . Different Signaling Pathways Lead to Phosphorylation and Activation of the Yeast Myosins I for Distinct Cellular Functions —Mutations in genes encoding myosins I cause multiple defects in eukaryotic cells . Although the primary cause leading to such phenotypes is not always fully understood , it is reasonable to think that myosins I participate in different cellular tasks , which might be regulated by distinct intracellu - lar and / or extracellular signals . To date , however , only PAKs have been identified as TEDS site kinases , and only the Cdc42p / PAK / myosins I signalingpathwayrequiredforthepolarizationoftheactincytoskeleton in yeast was described ( see Introduction ) . Reinforcing the physiological relevance of this signaling cascade , we showed that Myo5p was phos - phorylated in vivo and that a MYO5 TEDS site serine to alanine mutant ( myo5 - S357A ) failed to complement the actin polarization defect of a myosin I null strain . On the other hand , our results clearly showed that even though myosin I TEDS site phosphorylation was required for ligand - induced Ste2p internalization , tight in vivo inactivation of the Cdc42p / PAKs signaling pathway did not result in any significant uptake defect , not even under experimental conditions that clearly installed severe actin defects . These data demonstrated that sustained Cdc42p / PAK activity is not essential to support fast endocytic uptake in yeast , andtheysuggestedthatadifferentsignalingcascadecanactivateMyo3p and Myo5p for their endocytic function . Consistent with this view , we found that Myo5p physically and func - tionally interacts with different components of a signaling pathway that is known to control endocytosis in yeast ( 55 , 63 ) : the yeast homologues of the mammalian PDK1 , Pkh1p , and Pkh2p and their downstream FIGURE 10 .

Further , we demonstrated that purified Ypk2p specifically phosphorylates the Myo5p TEDS site in vitro . The mammalian PDK1 stands at a pivotal point in cell signaling , and it mediates a multitude of cellular responses following extracellular stimulation by peptide growth factors and hormones . Besides cell death and survival , deregulation of PDK1 influences a wide variety of pro - cesses , including cell growth , motility , and differentiation ( 67 ) . In yeast , Pkh1 / 2p have been shown to influence cell wall biogenesis ( 64 ) and endocytosis ( 55 , 63 ) . Our data provide now evidence for the first molec - ularmechanismwherebyPkh1 / 2pandYpk1 / 2pcanmodulatetheendo - cytic uptake rate by controlling the myosin I TEDS site phosphorylation state and , thereby , the myosin I ATPase activity . Nevertheless , it should be mentioned that myosins I are probably not the only Ypk1 / 2p targets requiredfortheendocyticuptake , sinceexpressionoftheMyo5 - S357Ep mutant , which mimics the constitutively phosphorylated state , failed to suppress the uptake defects of ypk1 / 2 mutants ( data not shown ) . Takentogether , weprovideforthefirsttimerobustevidencesuggest - ing that kinases other than PAKs can also phosphorylate the conserved TEDS site of the unconventional myosins and different signaling cas - cades can activate the myosins I to fulfill distinct cellular tasks .
