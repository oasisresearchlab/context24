JNK Regulates MCP - 1 Expression in Adenovirus Type 19 – Infected Human Corneal Fibroblasts Jingnan Xiao 1 and James Chodosh 1 , 2 , 3 P URPOSE . Previous studies indicate that adenovirus type 19 ( Ad19 ) infection of human corneal ﬁbroblasts ( HCFs ) induces the expression of several proinﬂammatory mediators , includ - ing IL - 8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( MCP - 1 ) , and that the tyrosine kinase c - Src and its downstream target , the mitogen - activated protein kinase ERK1 / 2 , mediate IL - 8 expres - sion . In this context , the authors sought to investigate the potential role of another mitogen - activated protein kinase , c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , in adenoviral ocular pathogenesis . M ETHODS . Ad19 - and mock - infected HCFs were solubilized at various time points after infection , and cell lysates were sub - jected to SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with a panel of antibodies against components of the MKK7 / JNK / c - Jun pathway or immunoprecipitated for JNK assay . The induc - tion of chemokine mRNA and protein was determined by real - time PCR and ELISA , respectively . R ESULTS . Ad19 induced the phosphorylation of MKK7 , JNK , and the downstream transcription factor c - Jun in HCFs at 15 and 30 minutes after infection . JNK activity was demonstrated at 30 minutes after infection using the GST – c - Jun fusion protein as a target substrate . SP600125 , a speciﬁc pharmacologic inhibitor of JNK , blocked MCP - 1 but not IL - 8 mRNA and protein expression . Finally , PP2 , a speciﬁc inhibitor of c - Src previously shown to inhibit the expression of both IL - 8 and MCP - 1 in Ad19 - infected HCFs , also blocked JNK phosphorylation after infection . C ONCLUSIONS . The MKK7 / JNK / c - Jun cascade is rapidly activated and mediates MCP - 1 expression in Ad19 - infected HCFs . Fur - thermore , the activation of c - Src on Ad19 infection appears to regulate both the ERK and the JNK pathways . ( Invest Ophthal - mol Vis Sci . 2005 ; 46 : 3777 – 3782 ) DOI : 10 . 1167 / iovs . 05 - 0724 H uman adenoviruses ( Ad ) have been identiﬁed as major pathogens in eye , gastrointestinal , and respiratory infec - tions . 1 They are classiﬁed into six subgroups or species ( A - F ) , comprising 51 serotypes . Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis ( EKC ) , the only ocular adenoviral infection with signiﬁcant corneal involvement , is typically caused by infection with either Ad8 , Ad19 , or Ad37 , all from subgroup D . 2 Keratocytes , the resident cells of the corneal stroma , main - tain the cornea in a precisely organized and transparent state . 3 Moreover , keratocytes play an active role in host responses to injury by production of a variety of cytokines and chemokines , such as IL - 1 , IL - 6 , IL - 8 , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) - 1 , TNF - (cid:1) , RANTES , and granulocyte – colony - stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) , and expression of adhesion molecules includ - ing intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) - 1 . 4 – 6 We have pre - viously suggested that proinﬂammatory mediator expression by Ad - infected keratocytes within the superﬁcial corneal stroma may play a role in the chronic and recurrent subepithe - lial stromal inﬂammation associated with EKC . 7 MCP - 1 , a member of the CC subfamily of chemokines , is chemotactic for monocytes , basophils , CD4 (cid:1) and CD8 (cid:1) lym - phocytes , and T lymphocytes of the activated memory subset . 8 MCP - 1 has been implicated as an important mediator of mono - cyte and lymphocyte inﬁltration of tissues in a wide variety of inﬂammatory diseases , such as glomerulonephritis , rheumatoid arthritis , and bacterial meningitis ( for a review , see Luster 9 ) . It has been shown that inhibiting MCP - 1 expression results in reduced transmigration of monocytes through blood vessels 10 and in diminished recruitment of T lymphocytes , 8 suggesting a critical role in acute inﬂammation . Human keratocytes produce MCP - 1 in response to a variety of cytokines , including IL - 1 (cid:1) and TNF - (cid:1) , and to lipopolysaccharide . 6 We previously demon - strated , by DNA microarray studies , increased MCP - 1 mRNA expression in Ad19 - infected keratocytes in vitro . 11 , 12 However , the mechanism ( s ) that mediate MCP - 1 production in kerato - cytes remain largely unknown . One means by which signals from extracellular stimuli are transmitted to the nucleus to impact proinﬂammatory gene expression is the activation of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) superfamily ( for a review , see Johnson and Lapadat 13 ) . In mammalian cells , there are three well - character - ized MAPK subfamilies , including the ERK1 / 2 , p38 , and c - Jun N - terminal stress - activated protein kinases ( JNKs ) . The ERK1 / 2 pathway preferentially regulates cell growth and differentia - tion . The p38 and JNK pathways are activated in response to a variety of stress inducers , including heat shock and UV irradi - ation . 14 , 15 MAPK has been shown to be activated by Ad infec - tion in several distinct in vitro models . For example , Ad5 infection of immortalized epithelial cell lines activated ERK , p38 MAPK , and JNK pathways . 16 , 17 Ad7 infection of A549 human lung carcinoma cells activated ERK1 / 2 , leading to IL - 8 expression . 18 We showed that Ad19 infection of cultured ker - atocytes activated ERK1 / 2 , and this activation mediated the expression of IL - 8 by these cells . 11 In the present study , we focused on the activation of the JNK signaling cascade and its potential role in MCP - 1 activation in Ad19 - infected keratocytes . We demonstrate that Ad19 induces MKK7 / JNK / c - Jun activation in these cells in vitro , which results in increased MCP - 1 expression at the mRNA and protein levels .

The anti – human MCP - 1 antibody and the biotin - conjugated anti – human MCP - 1 antibody were from BD PharMingen ( San Diego , CA ) . The Src inhibitor PP2 , JNK inhibitor SP600125 , and MEK inhibitor PD098059 were purchased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) . Actinomycin D was purchased from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) . Cell Culture and Viruses Primary keratocytes were derived from donor corneas , as previously described . 19 Brieﬂy , after mechanical debridement of the corneal epi - thelium and endothelium , corneas were cut into 2 - mm diameter sec - tions , and each section was placed in individual wells of six - well Falcon tissue culture plates with Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , penicillin G sodium , and streptomycin sulfate at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Corneal stromal fragments were removed before conﬂuence of each cell culture . Cells from multiple donors were pooled , and the cell monolayers were used at passage three . In the presence of 10 % FBS , keratocytes maintain a ﬁbroblast phenotype and are referred to as human corneal ﬁbroblasts ( HCFs ) . The ﬁbroblast phenotype was conﬁrmed by immunoﬂuores - cence staining with polyclonal anti – vimentin ( positive reactivity ) and anti – cytokeratin ( no reactivity ) antibodies , as previously described . 7 For inhibitor analysis , HCFs were pretreated with PP2 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) , SP600125 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) , or PD098059 ( 50 (cid:2) M ) for 3 hours at 37°C before infection . The cells were exposed to the inhibitors at the same con - centrations throughout the infection process . Cell toxicity caused by the inhibitors was ruled out after trypan blue exclusion on cells treated with inhibitors for the same amount of time and at the same concen - trations . The protocol for use of corneas from deceased human donors was approved by the University of Oklahoma Institutional Review Board and conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki . Ad19 was cultured directly from the cornea of a patient , as previ - ously described , 7 and was grown in lung carcinoma cells ( A549 cells , CCL 185 ; American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) in MEM with 2 % FBS , penicillin G sodium , and streptomycin sulfate . The Oklahoma State Department of Health conﬁrmed the viral serotype . Virus was puriﬁed from A549 cells by CsCl gradient , dialyzed against a 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) buffer that contained 80 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 % glycerol , titered in triplicate , and stored at (cid:2) 80°C . Viral Infection Monolayer HCFs grown to 95 % conﬂuence in six - well plates were washed in MEM with 2 % FBS and were infected with puriﬁed Ad19 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 50 or mock infected with virus - free dialysis buffer as a control . Virus was adsorbed at 37°C for 1 hour and then incubated for 1 additional hour before RNA isolation . For protein analyses , HCFs grown to 95 % conﬂuence in six - well plates were serum - starved for 18 to 24 hours before infection and were lysed after infection at the indicated time points . Immunoblot Analysis Ad19 - and mock - infected HCFs were lysed with chilled cell lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 2 . 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mM (cid:3) - glycerol phos - phate , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 (cid:2) g / mL leupeptin , and 1 mM phenylmethylsul - fonyl ﬂuoride [ PMSF ] ) and were incubated at 4°C for 5 minutes . Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 21 , 000 g for 15 minutes . The protein concentration of each supernatant was measured by BCA analysis ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) and equalized . Cell lysates were subse - quently separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellu - lose membranes ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) . The membranes were blocked for 1 hour with 4 % BSA in TTBS ( 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) and incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight . After three washes for 10 minutes each in TTBS , the membranes were incubated with peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room tem - perature , washed again , and visualized with an enhanced chemilumi - nescence ( ECL ) kit ( Amersham , Piscataway , NJ ) . Densitometric analy - sis of immunoblots where indicated was performed ( ImageQuant 5 . 2 ; Amersham , Piscataway , NJ ) in the linear range of detection , and abso - lute values were then normalized . JNK Assay JNK activity was determined ( JNK Assay Kit ; Cell Signaling Technol - ogy ) . Brieﬂy , endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated from 250 (cid:2) g cell lysate with an N - terminal c - Jun ( 1 – 89 ) fusion protein bound to glutathione Sepharose beads overnight at 4°C . Precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer ( 25 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM (cid:3) - glycerophosphate , 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and 10 mM MgCl 2 ) . The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of cold adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ; 100 (cid:2) M ) . After the cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 30°C , the reactions were stopped with 3 (cid:3) sample buffer . Proteins were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE followed by Western blot analysis . Membranes were probed with antibodies against phospho - c - Jun ( Ser 63 ) . Real - Time PCR Total RNA was isolated using a reagent ( TRIzol ; Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . RNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically , and the quality of each RNA sample was con - ﬁrmed by calculating the ratio of optical density at 260 : 280 nm . A ratio of 1 . 8 or higher indicated that samples contained only nondegraded RNA . Reverse transcription of 1 (cid:2) g RNA for cDNA synthesis was performed , and quantitative real - time PCR was carried out ( ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System ; PE Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Primers included the following : MCP - 1 ( GenBank accession no . BC009716 ) forward , 5 (cid:4) GCAATCAATGCCCCAGTCA 3 (cid:4) ; reverse , 5 (cid:4) TGCTGCTGGTGATTCTTC - TATAGCT 3 (cid:4) ; IL - 8 ( GenBank accession no . BT007067 ) forward , 5 (cid:4) AGCTGGCCGTGGCTCTCT 3 ; reverse , 5 (cid:4) CTGACATCTAAGTTCTT - TAGCACTCCTT 3 (cid:4) ; and GAPDH ( GenBank accession no . X01677 ) forward , 5 (cid:4) ATTCCACCCATGGCAAATTC 3 (cid:4) ; reverse , 5 (cid:4) CGCTCCTG - GAAGATGGTGAT 3 (cid:4) . Ampliﬁcation curves were generated by moni - toring the ﬂuorescence of SYBR Green as a measure of its incorpora - tion into the ampliﬁed product . GAPDH mRNA levels were used as an internal control . The fold change in mRNA levels for MCP - 1 and IL - 8 was calculated using the 2 - (cid:5)(cid:5) CT method , as previously described . 20 ELISA HCFs were infected in 48 - well plates with puriﬁed Ad19 or were mock infected with virus - free dialysis buffer as a control . Culture media were collected 4 hours after infection , and the levels of MCP - 1 were quan - tiﬁed by sandwich ELISA using capture and detection antibodies . The detection limit was 10 pg / mL . Plates were read on a microplate reader ( SpectraMax M2 ; Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) and were ana - lyzed with analysis software ( SOFTmax ; Molecular Devices ) . Means of triplicate ELISA values for each of the virus - and mock - infected wells were compared by ANOVA with Scheffe´’s multiple comparison test . Statistical signiﬁcance was set at alpha (cid:6) 0 . 01 . R ESULTS JNK Is Activated in Ad19 - Infected Human Corneal Fibroblasts We have previously shown that infection of HCFs by Ad19 activates the tyrosine kinases c - Src and ERK1 / 2 and that ERK1 / 2 acts downstream of c - Src . 11 Because JNK has also been shown to be activated by Src kinases , 21 we ﬁrst examined whether JNK was activated in HCFs in response to Ad19 infection . HCFs were Ad19 or mock infected for 15 and 30 minutes before cell lysis . Cell lysates were prepared for West - ern blot analysis and JNK assay using appropriate antibodies . The phospho - JNK antibodies used recognize JNK only when 3778 Xiao and Chodosh IOVS , October 2005 , Vol . 46 , No . 10 phosphorylated on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 residues . As shown in Figure 1A , infection of HCFs with Ad19 resulted in an increase in both phosphorylated forms of JNK ( 46 and 54 kDa ) at 15 and 30 minutes after infection , whereas total JNK levels remained unchanged . JNK activity was further examined by kinase assay . The activity of immunoprecipitated JNK from Ad19 - or mock - in - fected HCFs was assayed using an exogenous GST – c - Jun fusion protein as substrate . Ad19 induced an increase in the ability of JNK to phosphorylate GST – c - Jun substrate at 30 minutes after infection compared with mock treatment ( Fig . 1B ) . Phosphorylation of c - Jun by Ad19 One of the main downstream substrates for activated JNK is the transcription factor c - Jun ( for a review , see Davis 14 ) . JNK phosphorylates c - Jun at serine residues 63 and 73 , and acti - vated c - Jun in turn binds to 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - ace - tate ( TPA ) response elements . 14 To determine whether Ad19 infection of HCF also results in c - Jun phosphorylation , lysates from Ad19 - or mock - infected HCFs were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated and total c - Jun . As shown in Figure 2 , infection of HCF by Ad19 resulted in increased c - Jun phosphorylation at 15 and 30 minutes after infection . Notably , total c - Jun also increased at 30 minutes after infection . However , densitometry performed on phosphory - lated and total c - Jun bands still showed a relative increase in c - Jun phosphorylation at 30 minutes when normalized for total c - Jun . By densitometry , infection with Ad19 increased c - Jun phosphorylation by 5 . 8 - and 2 . 3 - fold at 15 and 30 minutes after infection , respectively ( Fig . 2 ) . Ad19 Infection Results in Phosphorylation of MKK7 but Not MKK4 MKK4 and MKK7 function as upstream activators of JNK by phosphorylation at JNK threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 resi - dues . 14 To demonstrate whether MKK4 or MKK7 is phosphor - ylated in Ad19 infection of HCFs , lysates from Ad19 - or mock - infected HCFs were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated and total MKK4 and MKK7 . As shown in Figure 3 , MKK7 was phosphorylated by Ad19 infection of HCF at 15 and 30 minutes after infection , whereas MKK4 was not . These observations suggest that activation of JNK in Ad19 - infected HCFs may be dependent on the activa - tion of MKK7 but not of MKK4 . c - Src Regulates JNK Activation As discussed , we have previously shown that the tyrosine kinase c - Src is rapidly activated in HCFs in response to Ad19 F IGURE 1 . Effect of Ad19 infection on JNK activation in HCF . ( A ) Cells were infected with Ad19 or mock infected with virus - free dialysis buffer for 15 or 30 minutes . Cells were then lysed , and cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against JNK and phospho - JNK . Reactivity against the 46 - and 54 - kDa forms of phospho - JNK was seen at both time points in the Ad19 - infected cells . ( B ) In vitro JNK assay performed at 30 minutes after infection shows increased phosphorylation of the c - Jun substrate signifying JNK activity on Ad19 infection of HCFs . F IGURE 2 . Effect of Ad19 infection on c - Jun phosphorylation in HCFs . By Western blot analysis , Ad19 infection – induced phosphorylation of c - Jun was apparent at 15 and 30 minutes after infection . There was also an observed increase in total c - Jun protein at 30 minutes after infec - tion , but densitometric analysis ( relative fold difference shown above the blot ) revealed an increase in phosphorylation of c - Jun even when the change in total c - Jun was taken into account . F IGURE 3 . Phosphorylation of MKK4 and MKK7 in HCFs on Ad19 infection . Western blot analysis of phosphorylated and total MKK4 and MKK7 at 15 and 30 minutes after Ad19 infection reveals phosphoryla - tion of MKK7 but not of MKK4 at both time points . IOVS , October 2005 , Vol . 46 , No . 10 JNK , MCP - 1 , and Ad19 3779 infection . 11 Given that JNK has been shown to be an important downstream target for activated Src kinases , 21 we sought to examine whether the activation of JNK is regulated by c - Src . HCFs were preincubated with PP2 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) , a selective inhib - itor of Src kinase family members , 22 followed by Ad19 or mock infection . Cell lysates were prepared at 30 minutes after infec - tion and were analyzed by Western blotting . As seen in Figure 4 , 10 (cid:2) M PP2 dramatically reduced Ad19 - induced JNK phos - phorylation , suggesting that JNK acts downstream of c - Src in Ad19 - infected HCFs . Ad19 - Induced MCP - 1 mRNA Expression Is Reduced by the JNK - Speciﬁc Inhibitor SP600125 By DNA microarray analysis , we have previously shown that Ad19 upregulates MCP - 1 mRNA expression in HCFs and that the c - Src inhibitor PP2 reduces MCP - 1 mRNA levels , suggesting that c - Src regulates MCP - 1 expression at the transcriptional level . 11 Because MAPK may act downstream of c - Src , we inves - tigated whether JNK or ERK1 / 2 is responsible for the expres - sion of this proinﬂammatory mediator . Reverse - transcription PCR suggested that MCP - 1 transcription was reduced in the presence of SP600125 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) , a speciﬁc JNK inhibitor ( Fig . 5 ) . 23 Subsequent quantitative real - time PCR was performed to compare the levels of MCP - 1 mRNA in Ad19 - infected cells with those in mock - infected HCFs , in the presence or absence of SP600125 and PD098059 , the latter a speciﬁc inhibitor of ERK1 / 2 activation . 24 As shown in Table 1 , the level of MCP - 1 mRNA was increased 5 . 1 - fold by Ad19 compared with mock infection , whereas SP600125 reduced the MCP - 1 mRNA level in Ad19 - infected cells to 1 . 6 - fold over mock - infected cells . SP600125 had no effect on IL - 8 mRNA levels ( data not shown ) . Interestingly , the ERK1 / 2 activation inhibitor PD098059 failed to reduce MCP - 1 mRNA levels ( data not shown ) , indicating that the activation of JNK , but not of ERK1 / 2 , is required for Ad19 - induced transcription of MCP - 1 . To determine whether Ad19 infection directly upregulates MCP - 1 transcription or merely increases the stability of MCP - 1 mRNA , HCFs were also infected in the presence or absence of actinomycin D ( 10 (cid:2) g / mL ) , an inhibitor of RNA polymerase . By real - time PCR , actinomycin D lowered MCP - 1 mRNA levels in Ad19 - infected HCF to levels similar to those of mock - infected control cells , suggesting a direct effect of Ad19 infection on MCP - 1 transcription ( data not shown ) . Ad19 - Induced MCP - 1 Protein Expression Is Reduced by the JNK - Speciﬁc Inhibitor SP600125 We also tested MCP - 1 expression at the protein level with ELISA . As shown in Figure 6 , Ad19 infection signiﬁcantly in - creased MCP - 1 levels in HCF compared with mock - infected control cells ( 1281 . 9 (cid:7) 69 . 6 vs . 292 . 5 (cid:7) 9 . 6 pg / mL ) , whereas SP600125 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) reduced MCP - 1 expression by Ad - 19 – in - fected HCF ( 231 . 0 (cid:7) 16 . 0 vs . 1281 . 9 (cid:7) 69 . 6 ; P (cid:8) 0 . 01 , both comparisons ) . These observations suggest that the activation of JNK is required for MCP - 1 gene transcription and subsequent protein synthesis in Ad19 - infected HCFs . D ISCUSSION Adenoviral internalization into target cells is an active cell - mediated process that uses intracellular signaling to direct clathrin - mediated endocytosis of the virus . 25 The initial attach - ment of adenoviruses to the cell is mediated by interaction between the penton ﬁber knob , the viral capsid protein most distal from the viral surface , and on the cellular side either CAR ( coxsackievirus and Ad receptor ) 26 or CD46 ( membrane cofac - tor protein ) . 27 – 29 This primary interaction facilitates an essen - tial secondary interaction between the viral penton base pro - F IGURE 4 . Analysis of relationship between c - Src and JNK in Ad19 - infected HCFs . Cells were incubated with the Src inhibitor PP2 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) before Ad19 or mock infection . Thirty minutes after infection , Western blot analysis using antibodies against phospho - JNK and total JNK reveals a reduction in phospho - JNK reactivity when the cells were pretreated with PP2 , consistent with JNK acting downstream of c - Src in the signaling cascade induced by infection . F IGURE 5 . RT - PCR analysis of MCP - 1 expression after Ad19 infection . HCFs were mock infected , infected with Ad19 , or pretreated with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) before infection . One hour after infection , MCP - 1 mRNA levels were increased in the Ad19 - infected cells , and this increase was blocked by pretreatment with SP600125 , suggesting that MCP - 1 transcription in Ad19 - infected HCFs occurs downstream of JNK activation . GAPDH mRNA levels are also shown as a control . T ABLE 1 . Real - Time PCR Analysis of the Effect of the JNK Inhibitor SP600125 on Ad19 - Induced MCP - 1 mRNA Expression Treatment Fold Increase Ad19 / mock 5 . 1 Ad19 plus SP600125 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) / mock 1 . 6 3780 Xiao and Chodosh IOVS , October 2005 , Vol . 46 , No . 10 tein on the proximal surface of the viral capsid and the cellular integrins (cid:1) v (cid:3) 3 or (cid:1) v (cid:3) 5 ( for a review , see Chang and Karin 30 ) . This latter contact causes aggregation of the integrins and induces virus internalization through a phosphoinositide - 3 ki - nase – dependent pathway . 31 Coincident intracellular signaling events associated with integrin aggregation after adenoviral binding have evoked considerable interest with regard to ad - enoviral gene therapy . For example , a recombinant Ad5 vector was shown to activate ERK1 / 2 , p38 , and JNK2 in cultured rheumatoid synoviocytes , 32 and similar signaling events in im - mortalized epithelial cells lines led to the upregulation of IL - 8 16 and ICAM - 1 , 17 events not thought beneﬁcial to the success of gene therapy . In this light , we previously found that Ad19 binding to HCF activates the non – receptor tyrosine kinase c - Src and its downstream target , ERK1 / 2 , and that the activity of both kinases is necessary for subsequent IL - 8 expression . 11 We show here that Ad19 infection of HCFs leads to activation of the JNK pathway , also downstream of c - Src , and that this activation leads to increased expression of MCP - 1 . The stress - induced JNK cascade is activated in response to many environmental stimuli and acts on multiple cellular func - tions . 14 In particular , the JNK pathway inﬂuences the expres - sion of proinﬂammatory mediators , including IL - 6 , IL - 8 , ICAM - 1 , MCP - 1 , 33 , 34 cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) , and prosta - glandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , 32 consistent with its central role in inﬂam - mation . We show that the activation of JNK directly or indi - rectly induces MCP - 1 because the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced MCP - 1 mRNA and protein expression . In contrast , SP600125 at the same concentration ( 10 (cid:2) M ) had no effect on IL - 8 mRNA and protein expression ( data not shown ) , previ - ously shown to be under the regulation of ERK1 / 2 . 11 Taken together , our ﬁndings suggest that the JNK pathway is impor - tant to MCP - 1 but not IL - 8 expression . The human MCP - 1 promoter contains binding sites for AP - 1 and NF - (cid:4) B , whereas the IL - 8 promoter contains binding sites for AP - 1 , NF - (cid:4) B , and NF - IL6 . 35 One of the plausible explanations for our ﬁndings is that MCP - 1 regulation by the JNK pathway is largely mediated by the AP - 1 sites , whereas IL - 8 regulation by the ERK1 / 2 cas - cade may be more dependent on NF - (cid:4) B or NF - IL6 . We also recently observed in Ad19 - infected HCFs that p38 is activated and acts downstream of c - Src and that its activation increases the expression of IL - 8 but not of MCP - 1 ( JX and JC , unpub - lished observation , 2005 ) . Taken together , these studies sug - gest a prominent role for c - Src in the regulation of downstream MAPK activation and serve to focus our attention on the MAPKs as proteins that may determine the speciﬁcity of che - mokine induction in infection . Interestingly , we also noted the increased expression of total c - Jun protein at 30 or more minutes after infection in repeated experiments , consistent with prior evidence that Ad19 infection induces the transcrip - tion of c - Jun . 11 However , the increased phosphorylation of c - Jun resulting from Ad19 infection was seen as early as 15 minutes after infection , before any increase in total c - Jun pro - tein . The development of chronic multifocal subepithelial cor - neal inﬁltrates after acute infection is one of the hallmarks of EKC 36 and is a major cause of long - term morbidity in the disorder . 37 Cellular components of the inﬁltrates in human EKC remain unknown . Experimentally , inﬁltrating cells within the corneal stroma of scariﬁed , Ad8 - infected cotton rats were primarily polymorphonuclear neutrophils . 38 Later in the course of infection in rabbits that received intracorneal injec - tions of Ad5 , CD4 (cid:1) and CD8 (cid:1) T lymphocytes and CD18 (cid:1) cells predominated within corneal stromal inﬁltrates . 39 Our previ - ous demonstration that the infection of human corneal ﬁbro - blasts in vitro with Ad19 induces the upregulation of IL - 8 protein , 7 the paradigm chemoattractant for neutrophils , to - gether with data presented herein that infected corneal ﬁbro - blasts also express increased MCP - 1 protein , known to be chemotactic for lymphocytes and monocytes , suggest that in - creased expression of chemokines by infected keratocytes may be responsible for the formation of subepithelial inﬁltrates in human EKC . The characterization of MCP - 1 as a target gene for the JNK signaling cascade on Ad19 infection of human corneal cells implicates JNK as an important mediator of inﬂammation in adenovirus keratitis . Along with c - Src and ERK1 / 2 , JNK may provide a potential therapeutic target in the corneas of human patients with EKC .

ELISA analysis of MCP - 1 expression after Ad19 infection . HCFs were mock infected , infected with Ad19 , or infected with Ad19 after pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 ( 10 (cid:2) M ) . At 4 hours after infection , MCP - 1 protein levels were signiﬁcantly increased , and this increase was blocked by pretreatment with SP600125 ( P (cid:8) 0 . 01 , both comparisons ) , suggesting that MCP - 1 transcription in Ad19 - infected HCF occurs downstream of JNK activation . Error bars repre - sent the SD of the mean . The ELISA shown is representative of three independent experiments with similar results .
