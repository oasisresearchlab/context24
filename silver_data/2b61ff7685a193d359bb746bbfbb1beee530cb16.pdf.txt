Deuterium oxide ( D 2 O ) and sodium borohydride ( NaBH 4 ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Paraformaldehyde ( 16 % solution ) and glutaraldehyde ( 8 % solution ) were obtained from Electron Microscopy Sciences ( EMS ) . All oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies . The DNA for mMaple3 was synthesized from the published protein sequence , while plasmids for other photoactivatable fluorescent proteins were obtained from labs or companies where they were developed . II . Cell culture ( a ) Chinese Hamster Ovary cells , CHO - K1 cells CHO - K1 cells were maintained in a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 o C in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium containing phenol red ( Gibco ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) . Cells were passaged every 2 – 3 days or at ~ 80 % confluency . All transfections and experiments were performed using cells under 20 passages . Prior to the transient transfection experiment , the CHO cells were passage and grown in an 8 - well chambered cover - glass ( Lab - Tek II ) . Transient transfections were carried out using Trans IT - CHO transfection kit ( Mirus ) following the company’s provided protocol with plasmid containing the ( PA - FP ) - Tubulin . Cells were imaged 30 hrs after transfection . ( b ) Drosophila Melanogaster Schneider 2 cells , S2 cells S2 cells were maintained at room temperature in Sf - 900 II SFM medium ( Gibco ) , supplemented with 10 % FBS . Cells were passaged every week or at ~ 80 % confluency . All transfections and experiments were performed using cells under 20 passages . Transient transfections were performed using Effectene Transfection Reagent ( Qiagen ) following the company’s protocol with plasmid containing either mCherry - Tubulin or GFP - Tubulin in a 6 - wells plate ( Corning ) for overnight . The following day , the transfected cells were seeded on Concanavalin A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) coated 8 - well chambered cover - glass and the cells were allowed to adhere to the coverglass for overnight . S4 III . Fixation of S2 cell S2 cells expressing FP - Tubulin were washed once with PBS . The cells were first fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde + 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10mins , followed by a reduction with 0 . 1 % NaBH 4 in PBS solution for 7 mins . Finally , the cells were washed with PBS thrice . IV . Imaging & Analysis ( a ) STORM imaging The imaging experiments were performed using a STORM microscope built from a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope . A 405 nm activation laser ( OBIS 405 , Coherent ) , 488 nm imaging laser ( OBIS 488 , Coherent ) and a 561 nm imaging laser ( Sapphire 561 , Coherent ) were aligned , expanded , and focused at the back focal plane of the UPlanSApo 1 . 4 NA 100x oil immersion objective ( Olympus ) . Images were recorded with an electron multiplying CCD camera ( iXon + DU897E - C20 - BV , Andor ) . The OBIS lasers were controlled directly by the computer whereas the Sapphire 561 nm laser was shuttered using an acoustic optical modular ( Crystal Technology ) . A quadband dichroic mirror ( ZT405 / 488 / 561 / 640rpc , Chroma ) and a band - pass filter ( ET525 / 50m , Chroma for 488 nm and ET595 / 50nm , Chroma for 561 nm ) separated the fluorescence emission from the excitation light . The images were recorded at a frame rate of 60 Hz . The typical power for the lasers at the back port of the microscope was 20 mW for the 488 nm imaging laser , 40 mW for the 561 nm imaging laser and 1 - 500  W for the 405 nm activation laser . During image acquisition , the axial drift of the microscope state was stabilized by a home - built focus stabilization system utilizing the reflection of an IR laser off the sample . Both data acquisition and analysis were performed using custom - written software . 1 The localization precision of each localization was estimated based on a previously established formula for the expected variance ( Mortensen et al . ) 2 : 𝜎 2 = 𝜎 𝑎2 𝑁 ( 16 9 + 8𝜋𝜎 𝑎2 𝑏 2 𝑁𝑎 2 ) , where 𝜎 𝑎2 = 𝜎 𝑃𝑆𝐹2 + 𝑎 2 / 12 . 𝜎 𝑃𝑆𝐹2 is the variance of the Point Spread Function in a two - dimensional Gaussian approximation , 𝑎 2 is the pixel area , 𝑁 the number of photons and 𝑏 2 the expected number of background photons per pixel . More specifically , the localization precision is reported as the Full Width Half Maximum ( FWHM ) , considering excess noise of the Electron Multiplying Charge Coupled Device ( EMCCD ) : 𝐿𝑃 𝐹𝑊𝐻𝑀 = 2√2 ln2√𝐹 𝐸𝑀𝐶𝐶𝐷 𝜎 2 , where 𝐹 𝐸𝑀𝐶𝐶𝐷 = 2 . S5 The mean localization precision in an image area was measured by a modified form of pair correlation analysis 3 utilizing the reversible blinking behavior of mEos2 . 4 Specifically , we calculated the distances between each localization point and all localization points within the 15 frames following the frame where this point appeared . The i ' th bin of the distance histogram was then normalized by 2 i – 1 to obtain the pair - correlation function . We fit the pair - correlation by a Gaussian peak centered at zero . The width of the peak reflects the uncertainty to localize the same mEos2 molecule when it is repetitively activated during the 15 frame time window . We note that this measurement may not yield an accurate absolute number for the localization precision , because those molecules not blinked during this time window will not contribute to the correlation peak . Nevertheless , it still provides an experiment - based , objective metric to compare the relative localization precision in the H 2 O and D 2 O cases . ( b ) Wide - field fluorescence imaging The imaging experiments were performed using an epi - fluorescence microscope built from a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope with a perfect - focusing system ( PFS ) . Excitation light was provided by an X - Cite - XLED1 fluorescence illuminator ( Lumen Dynamics ) with emission filters around 485 nm ( FF02 - 485 / 20 ) and 560 nm ( FF01 - 560 / 25 , Semrock ) , and images were recorded with an ORCA - Flash4 . 0 V2 sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . A quad - edge dichroic beamsplitter ( FF410 / 504 / 582 / 669 - Di01 , Semrock ) was used to separate the fluorescence emission from the excitation light . Additionally , an emission filter ( FF01 - 440 / 521 / 607 / 700 , Semrock ) was used . Images were recorded at a frame rate of 5 Hz using ~ 0 . 8 W / cm 2 of light around 485 nm or ~ 0 . 7 W / cm 2 of light around 560 nm . During image acquisition , the axial drift of the microscope state was stabilized by the PFS . The data acquisition was performed using custom - written software and the analysis was performed with ImageJ . For analysis , we used 2×2 pixel binning . ( c ) Photobleaching kinetics The photobleaching experiments were performed on the same set - up that was used for PALM imaging . Cells expressing GFP - tubulin were illuminated with ~ 13 mW / cm 2 of 488 nm , while cells expressing mEos2 - tubulin were first activated with ~ 7 mW / cm 2 of 405 nm for 20 secs before illuminating with ~ 13 mW / cm 2 of 561 nm . Images were recorded at 5 Hz . Plot z - axis Profile function in ImageJ was used to trace the fluorescent intensities . An ROI with a 0 . 7 × 0 . 7  m square region on a microtubule was applied and the data of 20 regions for a given experimental condition was analyzed using Origin 8 . The half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) was calculated using the equation t 1 / 2 = t1•ln2 , where t1 was obtained from fitting the data S6 curve with ExpDec1 function in Origin . The decay rate ( k ) was calculated using the equation k = 1 / t 1 . Reference : 1 . Huang , B . ; Wang , W . ; Bates , M . ; Zhuang , X . Science 2008 , 319 , 810 . 2 . Mortensen , K .
