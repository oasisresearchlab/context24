Abstract In an aging society , the issue of increased medical costs troubles both government agencies and families with aging parents . Many elderly people require long - term care , and the medical and financial prob - lems associated with long - term care worry their entire family . Mobile healthcare service ( MHS ) has been widely applied by medical practitioners and researchers for years . Unfortunately , the elderly often fear both the technology and the cost its use incurs ; hence , they seldom actively adopt MHS without the prompting and support of other family members . This study highlights this issue of long - term healthcare for the elderly and extracts the factors affecting their family’s intentions in adopting MHS . Based on the integration of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Technology Acceptance Model , the factors associated with the family’s intention of the aging people toward MHS are explored . Data were collected from 200 students in the ‘‘Job Master’’ track in a local ‘‘Executive Master of Business Administration’’ program . Half of them had at least one immediate family member who was older than 65 years of age . A partial least squares ( PLS ) analysis shows that ‘‘attitude’’ significantly affected the behavioral intention of adopting MHS , and ‘‘perceived useful - ness’’ and ‘‘perceived ease - of - use’’ had an indirect effect via ‘‘atti - tude . ’’ The PLS model explains the variance in intention ( 64 . 1 % ) , attitude ( 58 . 1 % ) , and perceived usefulness ( 33 . 8 % ) . Overall , this study shows that attitude was an important determinant of MHS adoption . Gender also significantly affected the relationship between attitude and behavioral intention to adopt MHS . Key words : mobile healthcare service , aging people , theory of planned behavior , technology acceptance model Introduction T aiwan is currently facing a demographic dilemma ; fewer children are being born , and the overall population is aging . At the same time , the cost of medical care is increasing yearly . 1 The issue of increased medical expenses for an aging population is a thorny issue awaiting solution . 2 A report on healthcare for elderly Americans shows that 85 % of people age 65 and older report at least one chronic condition ; more than half report at least two ; and more than a quarter report three or more . 3 Hence , we have to work hard to provide effective healthcare resources for the elderly . With increasing improvement in mobile technology , mobile healthcare is becoming an increasingly effective and economical approach for providing healthcare services to the elderly . Chronically ill elderly require more long - term care than other segments of the population . Providing healthcare for the elderly is an increasingly heavy burden and an important issue for families with elderly parents , insurers , and government agencies . Loera points out that the elderly perceive that mobile healthcare service ( MHS ) might positively improve their access to healthcare services . 4 Although Loera found the application of MHS was a convenient approach for most elderly people , some of them might have difficulty using MHS DOI : 10 . 1089 = tmj . 2009 . 0093 ª MARY ANN LIEBERT , INC . .

Moreover , fear of increased financial burden may cause the elderly to delay their use of MHS , thereby worrying family members and endangering their own health . Information provided by MHS is shared by patients , their families , and medical care providers . However , past studies provide an in - complete picture of a family’s intention to provide MHS for their elderly . While identifying the benefits of innovative mobile service to users is important , 5 it is also important to investigate the factors affecting the acceptance of mobile healthcare technology . 6 As con - cerned family members are the primary buyers of MHS services for elderly patients , this study investigates MHS purchaser intention ( immediate family of elderly patients ) rather than user intention ( elderly patients ) . Employing an intention - based approach , this study examines the integrated model derived from Theory of Planned Be - havior ( TPB ) and Technology Acceptance Model ( TAM ) to extract the factors influencing a family’s intention of providing MHS services to their elderly members . TPB is grounded on the Theory of Reasoned Action ( TRA ) , 7 , 8 which focuses on the behaviors of people who have incomplete volitional control . 8 TRA regarded behavior ( B ) as a direct function of behavioral intention ( BI ) and represented the antecedents of BI through attitude ( A ) , which reflects the favorable or unfavorable feelings to perform a behavior , and subjective norm ( SN ) , which reflects individual per - ceptions of social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior . As an extension of TRA , TPB adds the concept of perceived behavioral control ( PBC ) , which reflects the perceptions of ease or difficulty of performing the behavior to address conditions in which the individual does nothavecompletecontroloverthe performed behavior . 8 , 9 InTPB , behavior is determined by BI and PBC ; BI is a weighted function of attitude , subjective norm , and PBC . TPB can be formally stated below : B ¼ w 1 BI þ w 2 PBC BI ¼ w 3 A þ w 4 SN þ w 5 PBC where w is weight . Using TRA and TPB , it is difficult to identify a stable set of belief structures for attitude . 9 Likewise , SN is difficult to draw out from the mediator effort of attitude . 8 TAM is a special case of TRA in which two beliefs are specified : perceived usefulness ( PU ) , which reflects user’s subjective belief that using the technology will increase her = his performance , and perceived ease - of - use ( PEOU ) , which in - dicates the degree to which the mobile health service technology is easy to understand or operate . These factors comprise attitude and exclude the roles of subjective norm 9 , 10 and personal control factors on behavior . 9 TAM regards behavior as a direct function of BI , and BI is modeled by attitude and PU . PEOU is a direct determinant of PU ; attitude mediates the link between intention and beliefs about PU and PEOU . That is , B ¼ BI ¼ w 1 A þ w 2 PU A ¼ w 3 PU þ w 4 PEOU PU ¼ w 5 PEOU In past studies , the explanatory power of TPB and TAM has been inconsistent . While TAM focuses on the characteristics of system design and is particularly useful as a guide to design efforts , TPB pays more attention to normative and control factors so that organizations can easily implement the system based on those characteristics . 9 In Chinese tradition , long - term healthcare of the family’s elderly is a filial obligation . As perceived ability and control may be important determinants of behavior , 8 , 9 we used TPB as a direct predicting model of behavior intention and regarded the PU and PEOU as determinants of attitude that indirectly influence behavior intention . That is , BI ¼ w 1 A þ w 2 SN þ w 3 PBC A ¼ w 4 PU þ w 5 PEOU PU ¼ w 6 PEOU BI is the most important determinant of behavior for current predicting models for information technology ( IT ) use , 9 and the formation of an intention to carry out a behavior is regarded as a necessary precursor to behavior . 8 , 9 As behavior can be predicted from intention with considerable accuracy when behavior poses no serious problems of control , 8 selecting intention as the measurement of be - havior is theoretically justifiable and pragmatically adequate for IT in the early stages , especially because use is not yet widespread . 6 This article assessed the effects of attitude , SN , and PBC on BI , but it did not directly measure behaviors . Additionally , attitude often plays a major role in deciding IT use , and because personal demographics ( e . g . , age , gender , education level , monthly salary , marital status , and age and residency of parents ) may influence attitudes toward IT , the moderator effect of demographics should be further explored . Thus , we modified the function of BI as below : BI ¼ w 1 A þ w 2 SN þ w 3 PBC þ w 4 A (cid:1) Demographics The aim of this study is to explore the factors that affect the family’s intention to adopt MHS for their elderly . In the following pages , material and methods are briefly described , and an overview of the survey results and discussion are presented . Materials and Methods TPB and TAM provided taxonomies of variables affecting the in - tention to adopt innovative technology . Following the purpose of this JEN AND HUNG 42 TELEMEDICINE and e - HEALTH JANUARY = FEBRUARY 2010 study , the research model and hypotheses are proposed ( Fig . 1 presents the research model ) : H1 : Perceived ease - of - use is positively associated with perceived usefulness . H2 : Perceived ease - of - use is positively associated with attitude . H3 : Perceived usefulness is positively associated with attitude . H4 : Perceived usefulness is positively associated with behavioral intention of adopting MHS . H5 : Subjective norm is positively associated with behavioral in - tention of adopting MHS . H6 : Perceived behavioral control is positively associated with behavioral intention of adopting MHS . H7 : Attitude is positively associated with behavioral intention of adopting MHS . H8 : Demographics have a moderating impact on the relationship between attitude and behavioral intention of adopting MHS . In Chinese society , the family is a very important source of sup - port . The obligation to take care of one’s parents is especially em - phasized , and this intergenerational transfer is a safeguard against aging for the elders . Hence , providing long - term care for one’s family elders is an age - old tradition that continues today . Today’s elderly experienced post - World War II reconstruction and economic re - cession ; hence , they tend to be less well educated and less inclined to learn new things , and to be generally more conservative in their spending habits . In addition , some elderly are economically disad - vantaged because they have already distributed their assets to their children , another tradition . Influenced by these traditional values and attitudes , most elderly will adopt innovative services = products only at the urging and under the guidance of family members . Since most elderly are not MHS primary purchasers , this study investigates immediate family ( purchaser ) intention rather than the intention of family elders ( end users ) . Questionnaires were distributed to students enrolled in an Executive Master of Business Administration ( EMBA ) program at a university in central Taiwan . Generally speaking , most EMBA students are of good economic status , are strongly motivated learners , and are open to adopting innovative services = products ; hence , this study invited EMBA students to be our sample . The questionnaire consisted of two parts . The first part elicited respondent demographics , including age , gender , education , marital status , monthly salary , age of parents , and parent’s residency status . The second part contained the questionnaire proper , which consisted of 27 statements to which respondents were asked to indicate their degree of agreement . All 27 statements of the instrument had been validated by prior research . 9 In order to assess the face validity of the questionnaire , the help of 3 healthcare professionals and 2 mobile service researchers was enlisted . After discussion , the initial ques - tionnaire was revised to ensure that there was a good match between the information the questionnaire elicited and the factors upon which the intention to adopt MHS would be measured . A review of the literature shows that partial least squares ( PLS ) is a powerful second - generation multivariate technique for analyzing causal models involving multiple constructs with multiple observed items . 11 The PLS analysis was used to assess associations between factors and behavior intention . Both measurement and structural model were run simultaneously using Visual PLS 1 . 04b . The detailed descriptive analysis of demography was made by SPSS 13 . 0 ( SPSS , Inc . , Chicago , IL ) . Results Of the 200 questionnaires distributed , 192 were returned . After excluding incomplete questionnaires and questionnaires indicating no elder family member , a total of 100 usable questionnaires re - mained , a validation rate of 50 % . The question items for the abovementioned constructs are listed in the Appendix . Respondents of valid questionnaires were 59 % male ; 49 % were between the ages of 41 and 50 ; and 72 % of respondents’ parent’s residency status was ‘‘living with children . ’’ All data are listed in Table 1 . An analysis of the measurement model and structural model based on those samples is presented below . In the measurement model , convergent validity is commonly used to assess construct validity . 12 There are three recommended criteria . 13 First , factor load - ings of all standardized items are suggested to be higher than 0 . 5 . Second , the composite reliability is suggested to be higher than 0 . 6 . 14 Third , the average H 8 H 1 H 2 H 3 H 4 H 5 H 7 H 6 Subjective Norm Perceived Behavioral Control PerceivedUsefulness Attitude Perceived Ease of Use BehavioralIntention of adopting MHS Demographics Fig . 1 .

The results of con - struct validity of the instrument are listed in Table 2 and showed good construct validity . This means that the measurement model is ac - ceptable in terms of construct validity . Overall , the results provided empirical support for the instrument used to test our suggested model . In the structural model , we use the BootStrap procedure 15 to test the significance for all paths . Figure 2 shows the relative strengths of each path specified by the research model and the variance ( R 2 ) explained by each path . First , as hypothesized , PEOU is significantly associated with PU ( b ¼ 0 . 582 , t ¼ 8 . 942 , p < 0 . 01 ) and R 2 is 0 . 338 . Second , PEOU is significantly associated with ATT ( b ¼ 0 . 145 , t ¼ 1 . 978 , p < 0 . 05 ) . Third , PU is significantly associated with attitude ( ATT ) ( b ¼ 0 . 668 , t ¼ 10 . 186 , p < 0 . 01 . ) Collectively , PEOU and PU constructs account for 58 . 1 % of variance in ATT . Finally , among PU , SN , PBC , and ATT , only ATT has significant impact on BI ( b ¼ 0 . 547 , t ¼ 5 . 744 , p < 0 . 01 ) and accounts for 64 . 1 % of the variance in BI . In contrast , SN and PBC are not significantly associated with the BI of adopting MHS . There - fore , H1 , H2 , H3 , and H7 are supported . The results indicate that the BI of adopting MHS is explained by PEOU , PU , and ATT . In testing the moderator effect of demographics , the hierarchical procedure was used to compare the R 2 value for the interaction models with the main effects model , which excluded the demo - graphic constructs . The difference of R 2 value was used to judge the overall effect value ( f 2 ) for the interaction where 0 . 02 , 0 . 15 , and 0 . 35 had been suggested as small , moderate , and large effects , respec - tively . 16 As is shown in Table 3 , gender and monthly salary moder - ated the relationship between attitude and behavior intention toward MHS more greatly than in the main effect model and other interac - tion effect models . Although the effect values for the moderated effects of gender and monthly salary were small ( f 2 ¼ 0 . 043 and 0 . 029 ) , the effect of gender and monthly salary constructs still cannot be ignored . Gender , specifically , has a significantly greater moder - ating effect than other demographics . The mean analysis for both males and females toward MHS is listed in Table 4 . Males demon - strate a greater intention to use MHS and have higher attitude scores toward MHS than do females . With regard to the determinants of Table 1 .

Discussion This study objective integrated TAM and TPB , and the research model explains 64 . 1 % of families’ intention to adopt MHS for their elderly . The results indicated that attitude was the most important factor in determining a family’s intention to accept MHS . Ad - ditionally , while PEOU has a significant direct impact on PU of using MHS , it also has an indirect effect on attitude of using MHS through the mediator of PU . As PEOU has an indirect effect on ATT , we have to focus on its impact . If an elderly patient’s family perceives MHS as easy to use , they also perceive it as useful ; they then adopt MHS and help their elderly use the MHS technology . Similarly , Wu et al . 17 pointed out that PU and PEOU significantly affected healthcare professional BI in adopting the mobile healthcare information sys - tem . Obviously , whether it be medical care professions or the family of elderly patients , the primary factor in deciding to adopt MHS are PU and PEOU . Hence , we may conclude that , to be successful , all providers of mobile healthcare services and related products have to simplify their service functions and interfaces . Ensuring that MHS purchasers and users will readily perceive how easy MHS technology is to use will also ensure future growth for the MHS industry . Table 3 shows that both gender and monthly salary moderated the relationship between attitude and behavior intention toward MHS . This is an interesting issue that awaits researcher exploration .

JANUARY = FEBRUARY 2010 TELEMEDICINE and e - HEALTH 45 study extended prior research by theorizing and confirming a mod - erator role of demographics in the link between attitude and behavior intention toward MHS . The results demonstrate that gender signifi - cantly moderated the family’s attitude toward adopting MHS for use by their elderly family members . In this study , we integrated TAM and TPB , and explored whether normative and control factors affect a family’s intention to purchase MHS services for their elderly members . However , our findings indicated that SN and PBC were not significantly associated with the BI to adopt MHS . The study subjects , EMBA students , had relatively high socio - economic status as well as the competence and confidence to operate MHS technology . In Chinese society , long - term care for elders is provided for by the family . The subjective norm , a function of beliefs about the expectations of important referent others , had no significant effect upon the subjects’ BI toward MHS . In other words , the subjects did not consider these referents’ opinions ; they cared only about the services and functions MHS could provide . In sum , our findings indicated that PEOU , PU , and ATT could efficiently explain and predict family intention to purchase MHS services for their elderly members . During the present economic recession , it is important that low - cost , effective long - term healthcare be provided for the elderly .

JEN AND HUNG 46 TELEMEDICINE and e - HEALTH JANUARY = FEBRUARY 2010 interfaces , MHS will continue to contribute much to improving the quality of long - term healthcare services for the elderly . This research model is suitable for the areas of intergenerational transfer cultures such as China , Japan , Taiwan , and other countries whose social structures are based on Confucian values . However , this research model will not necessarily be suitable for other cultures , which is the limitation of this study . Finally , regardless of the local culture , there is no doubt that family elders will benefit greatly from the extended healthcare services mobile devices deliver if their families purchase MHS services and guide them in their use .
