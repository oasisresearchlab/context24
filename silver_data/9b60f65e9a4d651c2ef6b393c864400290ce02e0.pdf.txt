While it is known that the 29 rapid ( millisecond ) detection of mechanical forces is mediated by force - gated ion 30 channels , a detailed quantitative understanding of cells as sensors of mechanical energy 31 is still lacking . Here , we combine atomic force microscopy with patch - clamp 32 electrophysiology to determine the physical limits of cells expressing the force - gated ion 33 channels Piezo1 , Piezo2 , TREK1 , and TRAAK . We find that , depending on the ion channel 34 expressed , cells can function either as proportional or nonlinear transducers of 35 mechanical energy , detect mechanical energies as little as ~ 100 fJ , and with a resolution 36 of up to ~ 1 fJ . These specific energetic values depend on cell size , channel density , and 37 cytoskeletal architecture . We also make the surprising discovery that cells can transduce 38 forces either nearly instantaneously ( < 1ms ) , or with substantial time delay ( ~ 10 ms ) . 39 Using a chimeric experimental approach and simulations we show how such delays can 40 emerge from channel - intrinsic properties and the slow diffusion of tension in the 41 membrane . Overall , our experiments reveal the capabilities and limits of cellular 42 mechanosensing and provide insights into molecular mechanisms that different cell 43 types may employ to specialize for their distinct physiological roles . 44 45 Keywords 46 Mechanotransmission ; mechanotransduction ; force - gated ion channel ; cytoskeleton ; Piezo1 ; 47 Piezo2 ; TREK1 ; TRAAK 48 3 Introduction 49 The ability to detect mechanical forces is essential for a breadth of physiological processes 50 including our sense of light touch , proprioception , blood pressure regulation , bone homeostasis , 51 interoception , and cell differentiation ( Li et al . , 2019 ; Pathak et al . , 2014 ; Ranade et al . , 2014b ; 52 Sun et al . , 2019 ; Woo et al . , 2014 , 2015 ; Zeng et al . , 2018 ) . Despite this broad importance , our 53 quantitative understanding of cells as sensors of mechanical energy is extremely limited and 54 even seemingly simple questions about cellular mechanotransduction remain unanswered : 55 What is the smallest mechanical energy a cell can detect ? What is the smallest mechanical 56 energy a cell can resolve ? And how fast can cells respond ? 57 58 The most rapid detection of forces is mediated by force - gated ion channels ( FGICs ) , which 59 respond in as little as 40 µs by gating the flux of ions ( Corey and Hudspeth , 1979 ) . FGICs vary 60 in their ion selectivity , single - channel conductance , and gating kinetics , which enables cells to 61 transduce mechanical forces into distinct electrochemical signals . However , how FGICs 62 compare in their most fundamental property , the sensing of mechanical energy , is not well 63 understood ( Young et al . , 2022 ) . For example , measurements of the gating energy of the well - 64 studied ion channel Piezo1 differ substantially ( 8·10 - 21 J and 40·10 - 21 J ) , while for the two - pore 65 potassium channels TREK1 and TRAAK estimates span 1 - 10·10 - 21 J , and for Piezo2 and the 66 recently discovered TMEM63 channels such information is missing altogether ( Brohawn et al . , 67 2014a ; Cox et al . , 2016 ; Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ; Maksaev et al . , 2011 ; Murthy et al . , 2018 ) . 68 Similarly , fundamental molecular mechanisms of many FGICs are still unclear : while some 69 FGICs , such as Piezo1 , TREK1 , TREK2 , and TRAAK , can be directly activated by membrane 70 tension , others such as NOMPC sense force through tethers ( Aryal et al . , 2017 ; Berrier et al . , 71 2013 ; Brohawn et al . , 2014b ; Cox et al . , 2016 ; Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ; Maingret et al . , 1999 ; 72 4 Syeda et al . , 2016 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , both mechanisms are not mutually exclusive 73 and may act in synergy ( Sukharev and Sachs , 2012 ) . 74 75 Structural and mechanical properties of the cell are tightly coupled to force detection . 76 Specifically , the actin cytoskeleton can absorb mechanical forces ( mechanoprotection ) , while 77 also transmitting forces near or directly to the FGIC ( mechanotransmission ) . For example , the 78 actin cytoskeleton is a major determinant of cell stiffness and slows the transmission of 79 membrane tension ( Grady et al . , 2016 ; Shi et al . , 2018 ) . In contrast , the actin cytoskeleton can 80 tether to Piezo1 via the cadherin - ß - catenin complex so that actin disruption decreases Piezo1 - 81 mediated responses to cell indentation . Additionally , the actin cytoskeleton has been proposed 82 to transmit long - range forces to Piezo2 channels ( Gottlieb et al . , 2012 ; Verkest et al . , 2022 ; 83 Wang et al . , 2022 ) . Effectively , both processes compete and therefore to what extent the actin 84 cytoskeleton facilitates or impedes force sensing remains an open question . 85 86 Another impediment to a quantitative understanding of cells as mechanotransducers are 87 technical limitations : The standard assays for probing cellular mechanotransduction use 88 stimulation by pressure - clamp ( stretch ) and cell - indentation ( poke ) in combination with patch - 89 clamp electrophysiology ( Besch et al . , 2002 ; Hao and Delmas , 2011 ) . While both methods 90 provide an accurate readout of the electrical response , stretch stimulation disrupts the 91 underlying cytoskeleton and does not inform about the overall cellular response , and poke 92 stimulation cannot quantify the magnitude of the applied force . More sophisticated methods for 93 mechanical stimulation include magnetic force actuators , atomic force microscopy , optical 94 tweezers , and ultrasound , but often are combined with calcium - imaging , which does not yield a 95 precise measure of channel activity or kinetics and precludes the study of FGICs that do not 96 conduct calcium ( Falleroni et al . , 2018 ; Gaub and Müller , 2017 ; Hoffman et al . , 2022 ; Jembrek et 97 al . , 2015 ; Lee et al . , 2014 ; Lin et al . , 2019 ; Poole et al . , 2014 ; Prieto et al . , 2018 ; Ranade et al . , 98 5 2014a ; Sorum et al . , 2021 ; Wu et al . , 2016 ; Ye et al . , 2018 ) . In summary , none of these assays 99 can stimulate cells with a precisely quantified indentation , force , and energy , while also 100 measuring the transduction current with the gold - standard of electrophysiology . 101 102 Here , we developed an instrument that combines atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) with patch - 103 clamp electrophysiology to allow for quantitative mechanical stimulation and simultaneous 104 detection of the evoked transduction current . With this tool we set out to explore and precisely 105 quantify how single cells convert the energy of mechanical compression into an electric signal . 106 107 Results 108 Simultaneous measurements of cell compression and mechanotransduction 109 To quantify the magnitude of energies that cells can sense and respond to we built an 110 instrument that combines an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) with patch - clamp electrophysiology 111 ( Figure 1A - C ) . In each experiment , a flexible cantilever compresses a single cultured cell at a 112 speed of 40 µm / s , and then holds its position for 100 ms , before it is retracted at the same 113 speed . The cantilever , whose dimensions are comparable to the size of the cell , is centered on 114 a cell , and displaced for a total of ~ 6 µm , which altogether results in a large - scale compression 115 of the entire cell . Since the stiffness of each cantilever and the sensitivity of the detector to 116 cantilever bending is calibrated for individual experiments , we can calculate the distance ( d ) , 117 compression force ( F ) , and cumulative work ( W ) performed on the cell throughout the entire 118 experiment with a relative uncertainty of ≲ 20 % ( see Methods ) . At the same time , we record 119 electrophysiologically from the cell by patching it in the whole - cell configuration , which enables 120 us to measure the evoked transduction current ( I ) ( Figure 1D ) . 121 122 6 Initial validation experiments on HEK293T cells overexpressing the force - gated ion channel 123 Piezo1 show that AFM compression evokes rapid transduction currents at - 80 mV , which are 124 absent in cells transfected with YFP as control . Peak current amplitudes ( 1 . 1±0 . 5 nA , n = 16 ) are 125 comparable to those from classical poke - indentation experiments and inactivate with a time - 126 course of 25±4 ms ( n = 16 ) , which is expected for Piezo1 at this holding potential ( Coste et al . , 127 2010 ; J . Wu et al . , 2017 ) . We observed that the cantilever deflection is undergoing a small , but 128 noticeable adaptation during the static phase with a time course of 33±3 ms ( n = 16 ) when fit with 129 a single exponential decay , perhaps due to relaxation of the cell . We therefore focused all 130 subsequent analyses on the approach phase to calculate distance - current ( d / I ) , force - current 131 ( F / I ) , and work - current ( W / I ) relationships for understanding how cell compression evokes 132 mechanotransduction ( Figure 1E ) . 133 134 Linearity of cellular mechanotransduction 135 We next performed systematic AFM - electrophysiology experiments on HEK293T cells 136 overexpressing the force - gated ion channels Piezo1 , Piezo2 , TREK1 , and TRAAK ( Figure 2A , 137 Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We first noticed that work - current relationships differed 138 qualitatively in their linearity : cells expressing TREK1 and TRAAK showed currents that were 139 approximately proportional to the work performed on the cell . In comparison , work - current 140 relationships from cells expressing Piezo1 and Piezo2 appeared nonlinear . This qualitative 141 difference suggests that cells may in principle function either as proportional or nonlinear 142 transducers of mechanical energy . For quantification , we fit all individual measurements with a 143 power law ( 𝐼𝐼 = 𝑊𝑊 𝛼𝛼 ) , where a power - coefficient α = 1 indicates a perfectly linear ( directly 144 proportional ) transduction of mechanical work into current ( Figure 2B ) . Consistent with our 145 initial observation , work - current relationships of cells expressing TREK1 and TRAAK have 146 power - coefficients of 1 . 4±0 . 1 ( n = 60 ) and 1 . 9±0 . 2 ( n = 38 ) , respectively , confirming that cells 147 7 expressing TREK1 and to a lesser extent TRAAK behave approximately as proportional 148 transducers of mechanical energy . However , cells expressing Piezo2 , and even more so , cells 149 expressing Piezo1 have substantially larger power coefficients of 2 . 6±0 . 2 ( n = 47 ) , and 6 . 2±0 . 4 150 ( n = 39 ) , respectively , meaning that their responses are indeed highly nonlinear , i . e . , their force - 151 detection is akin to a switch . More generally , the data demonstrate that the identity of the 152 transduction channel defines this important response property . 153 154 The threshold and resolution for detecting mechanical energy 155 To quantify the transduction response further , we next calculated for each individual cell its 156 detection threshold ( W threshold ) , or the mechanical energy required to elicit a detectable 157 transduction current ( Figure 3A ) . While measurements vary substantially between individual 158 cells , summary data show that each channel type also confers distinct detection thresholds 159 ( Figure 3B ) . Cells expressing TREK1 exhibit the lowest thresholds of 68 . 2±6 . 3 fJ ( n = 60 ) , 160 whereas cells expressing Piezo1 exhibit the highest thresholds of 213 . 7±16 . 6 fJ ( n = 39 ) . In 161 addition , the detection thresholds of cells with the respectively related channels TRAAK 162 ( 124 . 5±11 . 9 fJ ; n = 38 ) and Piezo2 ( 86 . 8±7 . 1 fJ ; n = 47 ) differed by roughly two - fold from their 163 orthologs , meaning that detection thresholds are not conserved within channel families . Notably , 164 in this analysis the current amplitude corresponding to W threshold is equivalent to the activation of 165 only ~ 2 ion channels ( see Methods , ( Blin et al . , 2016 ; Coste et al . , 2015 ) ) . Thus , considering that 166 activating two Piezo1 channels requires an energy of Δ G ~ 80·10 - 8 fJ ( Cox et al . , 2016 ; Lewis 167 and Grandl , 2015 ) directly implies that > 10 7 - times more energy is absorbed by the cell before 168 transduction is initiated . This result shows a considerable capacity of the cell to buffer 169 mechanical energy . 170 171 We next reasoned that once this initial buffering capacity is depleted , the subsequent activation 172 of FGICs may be more efficient . To test this idea , we quantified the work resolution ( W resolution ) , 173 8 which we define as the inverse maximum slope of the work - current relationship normalized by 174 the unitary current of the transduction channel ( see Methods , Figure 3C ) . Intuitively , this 175 measure can be understood as the minimal mechanical work required to open the very next ion 176 channel , or as the smallest mechanical energy a cell can discriminate . Indeed , we found that 177 values for W resolution were almost 100 - fold smaller compared to W threshold , and in addition , unlike 178 detection thresholds , similar between related ion channels . Specifically , values for W resolution are 179 low for cells expressing Piezo1 ( 1 . 2±0 . 4 fJ ; n = 39 ) and Piezo2 ( 1 . 0±0 . 2 fJ ; n = 47 ) , but an order of 180 magnitude higher for cells expressing TRAAK ( 21 . 2±3 . 4 fJ ; n = 38 ) and TREK1 ( 14 . 0±2 . 1 fJ ; 181 n = 60 ) ( Figure 3D ) . Analogous to our above estimate , comparing the gating energy of Piezo1 182 yields that even when cellular mechanotransduction is at its most sensitive , > 10 5 - times more 183 energy is absorbed by the cell than is required for gating the very next ion channel . Altogether , 184 we conclude from this analysis that detection of mechanical energy by cells , despite 185 overexpression of FGICs , is a process that is extremely inefficient . 186 187 Molecular and cellular determinants of work threshold and resolution 188 Our above measurements of work threshold and work resolution clearly show that the specific 189 values are dependent on the identity of the FGIC and can be quite distinct from each other . 190 However , each specific measurement also exhibits a large degree of variability , which led us to 191 investigate further what other molecular or cellular factors may contribute towards the cellular 192 detection of mechanical energy . First , we reasoned that cell size could play an important role , 193 because it may determine the capacity to buffer mechanical energy . To test this idea , we took 194 advantage of the natural variability in cell size and correlated values for W threshold and W resolution of 195 all individual cells with their respective electric capacitance , which scales with membrane area 196 and is thus a proxy for cell size ( Hille , 2001 ) . Indeed , for both Piezo1 and Piezo2 values for 197 W threshold are positively correlated with cell capacitance , supporting this idea ( Figure 4A ) . 198 Surprisingly , K2P channel thresholds as well as W resolution across all channels did not correlate 199 9 with cell capacitance ( data not shown ) , indicating that cell size is important , but that additional 200 factors may contribute as well . We therefore turned our attention to channel density , which we 201 reasoned might be a more direct predictor of work threshold and work resolution , because it 202 determines the probability of activating multiple channels simultaneously . To test this idea , we 203 performed an additional analysis taking advantage of the polymodal nature of TREK1 and 204 TRAAK , which can be activated by both mechanical force and voltage ( Berrier et al . , 2013 ; 205 Maingret et al . , 1999 ) . Specifically , we measured the membrane capacitance as a proxy for 206 total membrane surface area and the baseline current at 0 mV to calculate channel density , in 207 addition to probing mechanotransduction as described above ( Figure 4B , see Methods ) . In 208 these measurements , channel density varied ~ 20 - fold for TRAAK and ~ 50 - fold for TREK1 , 209 allowing us to sample a wide range . We indeed found that values for W threshold and W resolution 210 correlate negatively with channel density ( Figure 4C - F ) . In summary , we conclude that absolute 211 cell size and , more directly , channel density modulate the detection threshold and resolution of 212 cellular mechanosensing . 213 Still , what fraction of all channels are actually activated during a given mechanical stimulus still 214 remains unclear . Mechanotransduction differs from , for example , voltage - sensing , where 215 stimulus intensity is spatially homogenous . In contrast , forces are generally not uniform across 216 the entire cell ( Young et al . , 2022 ) . To answer this question , we focused on TREK1 for which we 217 designed a new stimulation protocol . We used an internal buffer with Rb + as the dominant ion , 218 which has been shown to left - shift the voltage dependence of TREK1 ( Schewe et al . , 2016 ) . In 219 this buffer we were able to saturate the conductance - voltage relationship of TREK1 at 160 mV 220 and thus , after normalizing for driving force , calculate the number of channels present in the 221 entire cell ( Figure 4G , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Across all cells we measured , the total 222 number of channels ranged roughly between 1 , 000 and 2 , 000 . In the same experiment we 223 mechanically stimulated cells , as previously described , and determine the number of channels 224 10 recruited by the mechanical stimulus relative to the voltage step . Surprisingly , despite an overall 225 large - scale compression , which elicited robust mechanically activated currents ( 161±22 pA ; 226 n = 12 ) , only 6 . 9±1 . 2 % ( n = 12 ) of all channels were activated by this mechanical stimulus ( Figure 227 4H ) . Importantly , the value of 6 . 9±1 . 2 % may still be an overestimate since the mechanically 228 gated open state of TREK1 has a two - fold higher conductance as compared to the voltage - 229 activated state , although this was in standard K + buffer ( Rietmeijer et al . , 2021 ) . 230 231 In addition , we hypothesized that the cytoskeleton , which has previously been implicated in 232 mechanoprotection of FGICs , but also in transmitting forces , contributes towards setting cellular 233 detection limits ( Cox et al . , 2016 ; Gottlieb et al . , 2012 ; Jia et al . , 2016 ; Lotshaw , 2007 ; Shi et al . , 234 2018 ; Verkest et al . , 2022 ; Wang et al . , 2022 ) . We therefore decided to disrupt cytoskeletal 235 architecture and measure which of these two opposing effects dominates . Specifically , we 236 treated cells for 1 hour with Cytochalasin D ( 10 µM ) , which competes with barbed - end actin - 237 binding proteins to affect both polymerization and depolymerization , destabilizing the overall 238 actin architecture ( Flanagan and Lin , 1980 ; MacLean ‑ Fletcher and Pollard , 1980 ) . Any reduction 239 in W threshold or W resolution would point to a net mechanoprotective role of the actin cytoskeleton , 240 whereas an increase would indicate mechanotransmission instead dominates . First , in separate 241 AFM experiments we established that cytochalasin D treatment effectively reduces the elastic 242 modulus ( cells become softer ) : CytoD : 70 . 3±5 . 7 Pa ( n = 12 ) , Untreated : 147 . 8±20 . 8 Pa ( n = 12 ) , 243 p = 0 . 005 ( Figure 5A - B ) . We next applied our initial AFM - electrophysiology stimulation protocol 244 to determine W threshold and W resolution on both Cytochalasin D treated cells and day - matched 245 vehicle controls ( Figure 5C ) . Cytochalasin D treatment led to a substantial decrease in the 246 detection threshold ( CytoD : 13 . 7±1 . 3 fJ , n = 16 ; DMSO : 34 . 9±6 . 0 fJ , n = 14 ; p = 0 . 0049 ) in cells 247 expressing Piezo2 ( Figure 5D ) . Similarly , work resolution decreased > 4 - fold as compared to 248 controls ( CytoD : 0 . 08±0 . 02 fJ , n = 16 ; DMSO : 0 . 38±0 . 09 fJ , n = 14 ; p = 0 . 0073 ) ( Figure 5E ) . 249 Surprisingly , this effect was specific to Piezo2 , as we saw no significant changes in W threshold or 250 11 W resolution for cells expressing TREK1 , TRAAK , or Piezo1 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , 251 which suggests that Piezo2 is particularly sensitive to actin manipulation and that actin plays a 252 predominantly mechanoprotective role . Taken together , we found that channel density is a 253 general determinant of cellular sensitivity to mechanical forces , and that the actin cytoskeleton 254 is a very effective modulator of cells expressing Piezo2 . 255 256 The speed of cellular mechanotransduction 257 It is known that Piezo and K2P channels open and conduct ions within milliseconds upon 258 exposure to a mechanical stimulus ( Berrier et al . , 2013 ; Coste et al . , 2010 ; Maingret et al . , 259 1999 ) . However , the precise timing of their response with respect to applied mechanical forces 260 has not been quantified . In a subset of our collected recordings , we noticed a time delay ( Δ t ) 261 between the maximal applied force ( peak force ) , which indicates the time point at which the 262 piezoscanner ceases to move and compress the cell , and the resulting maximal transduction 263 response ( peak current ) ( Figure 6A ) . Indeed , careful analysis revealed that cells expressing 264 Piezo1 and TREK1 exhibited a substantial response delay of 8 . 2±2 . 2 ms ( n = 39 ) and 15 . 6±2 . 2 265 ms ( n = 60 ) , respectively . Conversely , cells expressing Piezo2 and TRAAK responded within 266 1 . 5±0 . 5 ms ( n = 47 ) and 8 . 5±2 . 6 ms ( n = 38 ) , respectively ( Figure 6B - C ) . The rapid response of 267 Piezo2 highlights that cells have , in principle , the ability to transduce forces with very fast ( ~ 1 268 ms ) speed . Further , for Piezo1 ( and to a lesser extent Piezo2 ) the magnitude of the delay 269 correlated with the intensity of the stimulus as measured by peak force amplitude ( Figure 6D - 270 E ) . This was not the case however for either TREK1 or TRAAK ( data not shown ) . Importantly , 271 we discovered that classical cell - indentation ( poke ) experiments on cells expressing Piezo1 or 272 Piezo2 also revealed a response delay , after we aligned current responses to the end of the 273 stimulus ramp ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) , giving us confidence that this phenomenon 274 was not an artefact of our AFM instrument . 275 276 12 We hypothesized that both channel - intrinsic and cellular properties may account for this delay . 277 We therefore first repeated our experiments with cells expressing a chimeric channel Piezo1 cap2 , 278 for which previous work from our lab demonstrated that the cap domain of Piezo2 is sufficient to 279 confer the fast inactivation kinetics of Piezo2 onto the normally slowly - inactivating Piezo1 280 ( Figure 6F ) ( J . Wu et al . , 2017 ) . Indeed , cells expressing Piezo1 cap2 responded within ~ 1 ms 281 ( 1 . 1±0 . 2 ms , n = 11 ) , which is statistically identical to Piezo2 ( Figure 6G ) . Again , classical cell - 282 indentation ( poke ) experiments produced qualitatively identical results ( Figure 6—figure 283 supplement 1 ) . These results show that channel intrinsic properties , and in the specific case of 284 Piezos , the cap domain , can determine the speed of cellular mechanotransduction . 285 Second , we reasoned that the slow diffusion of membrane tension may activate channels near 286 the stimulation site , but with a time delay . We therefore turned to an in silico approach , where 287 we simulated the gating of thousands of individual , spatially randomly distributed ( ~ 100 288 channels / µm 2 ) , Piezo1 channels with a previously validated four - state Markov model ( Lewis and 289 Grandl , 2021 ) ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ; Lewis et al . , 2017 ) . We then challenged channels with a 290 spatially confined ( 2 µm radius ) step in membrane tension , which diffused in two dimensions 291 with a speed of either D = 0 . 024 µm 2 / s , which had been determined experimentally for HeLa 292 cells , or 10 and 100 - fold faster speeds ( D = 0 . 24 µm 2 / s and 2 . 4 µm 2 / s , respectively ) , which is 293 still one order of magnitude below the fastest diffusion values measured in neuronal axons ( D = 294 20 µm 2 / s ) ( see Methods ; Figure 7A - C ) ( Shi et al . , 2022 , 2018 ) . Independent repetitions of this 295 simulation with a diffusion constant of D = 2 . 4 µm 2 / s consistently showed a time delay in peak 296 current amplitudes ( dt = 6 . 2±0 . 6 ms ) that approximated our experimental findings for Piezo1 , 297 while simulations with slower diffusion constants ( D = 0 µm 2 / s , D = 0 . 024 µm 2 / s , and D = 0 . 24 298 µm 2 / s ) produced time delays that were less pronounced or entirely absent ( Figure 7E ) . Overall , 299 we conclude that the time delay we observed experimentally is indeed consistent with being an 300 emergent property of membrane tension diffusion and further that the magnitude of this time 301 13 delay is determined by the identity of the FGIC and the specific diffusion rate of the cell 302 membrane . 303 304 14 Discussion 305 In this study , we aimed to explore the capabilities and limitations of cells as transducers of 306 mechanical energy . To this end , we developed an instrument that combines AFM with whole - 307 cell patch - clamp electrophysiology . This approach comes with caveats and potential sources for 308 errors that need to be considered : First , we estimate an uncertainty in cantilever calibration of 309 ≲ 20 % , which is consistent with other studies ( Song et al . , 2015 ) . Second , nonlinearity in the 310 photodetector response may result in an underestimate of the most extreme forces of up to 311 29±3 % and consequently also the calculated energies . This error has only a minimal effect on 312 work threshold values , since these are determined within the linear range of the photodetector 313 but may result in an overestimate of work resolution values . Third , the precise contact area 314 between the cantilever and cell is unknown , which introduces an uncertainty in the spatial 315 distribution of the stimulus as well as variability between measurements . Additionally , the time 316 course of the stimulus ( 150 ms ) is slow relative to the inactivation rates of the channels we 317 studied . As a result , competing activation and inactivation lead to an underestimate of peak 318 channel activity . Finally , by forming a whole - cell configuration the cell is no longer a 319 hydrostatically closed system , and mechanical load may dissipate through the patch pipette , 320 which again may lead to an overestimate of the work performed on the cell . Indeed , this may 321 contribute to the force relaxation we observed during the holding phase of the cantilever . Still , 322 the specific forces we measured at the transduction threshold for Piezo1 ( 228 . 2±16 . 4 nN ; n = 39 ) 323 are comparable to those found using calcium imaging ( 185 nN ) , where the cell membrane 324 remains intact , giving us confidence in these measuerments ( Gaub and Müller , 2017 ) . In any 325 case , the detection threshold and work resolution we obtain for cells expressing different ion 326 channels are clearly distinct , arguing that our instrument has sufficient precision . 327 328 15 In addition to experimental uncertainties , our experimental preparation differs from a 329 physiological environment in several aspects : First , we seeded cells at low density and onto 330 glass coverslips , which is necessary to both mechanically and electrically isolate cell properties , 331 but removes contributions from neighboring cells present in tissue , and may alter the 332 mechanical properties of the cell itself . For example , some evidence suggests that cell elasticity 333 may vary with the stiffness of the underlying substrate , although a more recent study challenges 334 this finding ( Rheinlaender et al . , 2020 ; Tee et al . , 2011 ) . In any case , by using glass , which has 335 a stiffness that is much higher than that of the cantilever , substrate deformation and the related 336 energy loss is minimized and therefore nearly all mechanical work is performed on the cell . 337 Second , we overexpress the channel of interest , which does not reflect native expression levels , 338 but is necessary to overcome potential contributions of endogenous FGICs , and allowed us to 339 clearly determine the role that channel identity plays in setting the physical limits ( Dubin et al . , 340 2017 ) . Third , the flat cantilever of our AFM instrument is not a natural stimulus , but the resulting 341 large - scale compression of the cell is arguably similar to the stimulation some cells - types 342 experience in - vivo : For example , chondrocytes , which express both Piezo1 and Piezo and form 343 cartilage of joints , and osteoblasts , which express Piezo1 and synthesize bones , are globally 344 compressed by body weight ( Hendrickx et al . , 2021 ; Lee et al . , 2014 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ) . Similarly , 345 Merkel cells , which express Piezo2 , are compressed by indentation of the skin ( Maksimovic et 346 al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , our approach is not only biophysically useful , but to some extent also 347 physiologically relevant . Taken together , the approach and preparation we use are not intended 348 to match physiological settings but are ideal for exploring the limits of cell - autonomous rapid 349 force - sensing . 350 351 Biological sensory systems have evolved exquisite sensitivity to their relevant stimuli , while 352 operating under constant noise present in the environment , which ideally enables reliable 353 detection and discrimination of relevant signals . At the lower limit all physical systems are 354 16 subject to thermal noise ( k b ·T = 4 . 11·10 - 21 J at room temperature ) and FGICs themselves are 355 estimated to have gating energies very near this thermal limit ( Brohawn et al . , 2014a ; Cox et al . , 356 2016 ; Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ; Lin et al . , 2019 ; Maksaev et al . , 2011 ) . We were surprised to find 357 that even in an overexpression system the lowest detection threshold and resolution we 358 observed were 68 . 2±6 . 3 fJ and 1 . 0±0 . 2 fJ , respectively . For comparison , our own visual system 359 can detect single photons ( ~ 4·10 - 19 J ) , although only in low - noise conditions ( dark ) ( Rieke and 360 Baylor , 1998 ) . The relatively high energy required for mechanical sensing may therefore be a 361 consequence of a high magnitude of mechanical noise present in cells , for example caused by 362 intrinsic forces generated by myosin motors ( Ellefsen et al . , 2019 ) . In line with this interpretation 363 is our result that only a small fraction ( 6 . 9±1 . 2 % ) of TREK1 channels is activated by our large - 364 scale cell compression and that current responses never saturated . For Piezo channels this 365 fraction may be higher , because despite a smaller unitary conductance ( ~ 20 - 30 pS for Piezos 366 vs ~ 90 pS for TREK1 ) and comparable driving force ( ~ 80 mV for Piezos vs ~ 95 mV for TREK1 ) , 367 and faster inactivation , the elicited peak current amplitudes were higher . Regardless , our 368 measurements clearly show that cells are inherently inefficient sensors of mechanical energies . 369 370 Three additional and very surprising findings emerged from our study : First , we found that cells 371 can have pronounced ( ~ 10 ms ) delays in their transduction response . Our chimeric approach 372 shows that response delay is a channel intrinsic property and that cells can inherently respond 373 rapidly ( < 1ms ) . In addition , it was intriguing that this delay is almost absent in cells expressing 374 Piezo2 , which are present in DRG neurons , Merkel cells , and hair cells of the inner ear ( Ranade 375 et al . , 2014b ; Woo et al . , 2015 , 2014 ; Z . Wu et al . , 2017 ) . It is therefore interesting to speculate 376 that Piezo2 may have specialized to respond rapidly to fulfill its role in rapid sensory 377 transduction . Second , our simulations show that a time delay can emerge naturally from the 378 slow diffusion of tension . Of course , the actual spatial distribution of the stimulus and the speed 379 of membrane diffusion that underlie our experiments are likely different from the tension clamp 380 17 we simulated , which may explain the less pronounced delays in silico . Moreover , differing 381 tension sensitivities and inactivation kinetics may explain why we found that Piezo2 , TREK1 , 382 and TRAAK have response delays that are distinct from Piezo1 . For example , increased tension 383 sensitivity or slower inactivation kinetics may easily explain how channels can be activated with 384 high probability far away from the stimulation site , altogether resulting in longer response 385 delays . Importantly , recent work has shown that certain subcellular domains may be specialized 386 to diffuse tension much faster , allowing long - range mechanical coupling . Interestingly , neuronal 387 axons are among these regions which may have important implications for the transduction of 388 mechanical touch ( Gomis Perez et al . , 2022 ; Shi et al . , 2022 ) . We propose that in addition to long 389 range mechanical coupling , tuning the rate of tension diffusion has important implications for the 390 timing of the mechanotransduction response . This property may be particularly important for 391 sensory systems , where the cellular response needs to reliably reflect the temporal 392 characteristics of the underlying stimulus . 393 Third , we found that cells expressing TRAAK and TREK1 function as proportional transducers 394 of mechanical energy , whereas cells expressing Piezos showed a highly nonlinear step - like 395 response . Qualitatively , this behavior is reminiscent of the respective pressure - clamp ( stretch ) 396 induced responses for TRAAK , TREK1 , and Piezo1 ( Piezo2 is not efficiently activated by 397 membrane stretch ) , which have shallower slopes in their pressure response curves relative to 398 Piezo1 ( Brohawn , 2015 ; Brohawn et al . , 2014b ; Coste et al . , 2010 ) . On a cellular level this 399 response property has important implications for how stimulus intensity is encoded . For 400 example , a shallow , graded response is better suited to encode stimuli across a wider dynamic 401 range , whereas a steep , switch - like response is better suited to encode the crossing of a 402 particular threshold . Interestingly , Piezo1 showed a particularly steep work - current relationship , 403 which raises the question how this widely expressed ion channel may endow different cell types 404 to sense distinct mechanical stimulus intensities . 405 18 406 We also identified several factors that influence the response properties of cells . Our data 407 suggest that cell size and channel density may be mechanisms to modulate the response 408 properties of cells . The fact that we only observed a correlation between cell size and response 409 properties in cells expressing Piezos , but not in K2P channels may be due to differences in 410 dynamic range and variability in expression levels we are able to explore . Additionally , 411 disrupting the cytoskeleton resulted in a stark decrease in both the detection threshold and the 412 work resolution , specifically in cells expressing Piezo2 . This result is consistent with the 413 cytoskeleton playing a strong mechanoprotective role by limiting the transmission of mechanical 414 energy to Piezo2 channels . It would be interesting to see , given the role of Piezo2 in sensory 415 transduction , whether specialized sensory cells take advantage of this sensitivity to actin 416 disruption , for instance by localizing Piezo2 to specialized signaling domains of low actin 417 density . 418 419 Altogether , our novel approach and its results provide a quantitative framework for 420 understanding the energetics of mechanosensing on the level of single cells . A natural 421 extension of this work would be to next characterize primary mechanosensory cells . From there , 422 we may learn the magnitudes of mechanical energies a particular cell - type is tuned to sense , 423 how they compare to the parameter space we found in our heterologous system , and finally 424 what mechanisms these cells may have to extend or constrain their properties as cellular 425 mechanosensors . 426 427 Acknowledgements 428 This study was supported by NIH 5R01NS110552 ( M .

Cells were reseeded into 6 - well plates and transfected ( mouse Piezo1 - 443 pIRES - EGFP ( Coste et al . , 2012 ) , mouse TREK1 - pIRES2 - EGFP , and mouse pCEH - TRAAK - 444 GFP , YFP alone : 3 µg ; mouse Piezo2 ( Lewis et al . , 2017 ) : 2 . 5 µg + 0 . 5 µg YFP ) with Fugene 6 445 ( Promega , Madison , WI ) 48 hours prior to recording at a transfection ratio of 10 µL Fugene6 : 3 446 µg total DNA . Glass coverslips ( 1 . 5 mm ; Warner Instruments , Hamden , CT ) were coated with 447 0 . 1 mg / mL Poly - L - Lysine at room temperature for 30 minutes followed by 1 µg / mL Laminin at 37 448 ⁰ C for 45 minutes to 1 hour . Cells were trypsinized and transferred onto coated coverslips16 - 24 449 hours before recording . Cell cultures were limited to 20 passages . 450 Cells treated with Cytochalasin D ( 10 μ M solubilized in DMSO ; both Sigma , Burlington , MA ) for 451 1 hour prior to and throughout the recording session . Control cells were day - matched and 452 treated with an equal volume of DMSO over the same time course . 453 454 20 AFM Instrument 455 A Digital Instruments ( Bruker , Billerica , MA ) Bioscope was modified for simultaneous use with 456 electrophysiology : A custom - designed aluminum stage was manufactured ( Protolabs , Maple 457 Plain , MN ) to mount the Bioscope to a Nikon Ti - E inverted microscope . The position limiters on 458 the stock Bioscope head were removed and a custom stopper was designed and 3D - printed to 459 increase the lower - limit of the Bioscope head position . The stock fluid - cell probe holder was BK - 460 7 glass with anti - reflective coating and custom cut ( Mindrum Precision , Rancho Cucamonga , 461 CA ) to allow access to a patch - pipette near the cantilever tip . The pipette manipulator was set to 462 a 15º angle , and the stage ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) was additionally modified to increase the 463 lower limit of the manipulator position . A large bath was 3D printed to allow positioning of both 464 the probe - holder and a patch - pipette over the coverslip . The photodetector signal was passed 465 from the Bioscope through a signal access module ( Veeco , Plainview , NY ) to an EPC10 466 amplifier ( HEKA Elektronik ) . The signal access module also allowed external control of the 467 piezoscanner . For this , a digital trigger signal was passed from Patchmaster ( HEKA Elektronik ) 468 to custom software written in Labview 2016 ( National Instruments , Austin , TX ) generating the 469 stimulus waveform , which was then passed to a high - voltage amplifier ( EPA - 104 ; Piezo . com , 470 Woburn , MA ) and subsequently via the signal access module to the Nanoscope3a controller 471 ( Bruker ) and the piezoscanner z - drive . The correspondence between the scanner position and 472 the applied command voltage was determined by the scanner calibration in the Nanoscope 473 software ( v5 . 33 ) after manufacturer calibration . 474 475 AFM Calibration 476 CSC37 , CSC38 , or NSC35 tipless , chromium and gold - coated cantilevers ( Mikromasch , Tallinn , 477 Estonia ) were mounted to a custom probe holder and attached to the Bioscope head . Prior to 478 experiments , for each individual cantilever the stiffness was determined using the method of 479 Sader ( Chon et al . , 2000 ; Sader , 1998 ; Sader et al . , 1999 ) . Briefly , the dimensions of the 480 21 cantilever were measured optically ( Nikon Ti - E ) . The quality factor ( Q ) , amplitude ( A ) , and 481 resonant frequency ( f 0 ) were determined by fitting the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator 482 to power spectra of the free cantilever vertical displacement signal ( P ) in air averaged across 483 512 spectra using Welch’s method ( Welch , 1967 ) and sampled at > 5 - fold the expected 484 resonance frequency using a National Instruments Data Acquisition Board ( NI - USB 6361 ) . 485 𝑃𝑃 = 𝐴𝐴∙𝑓𝑓 0 �𝑓𝑓 2 −𝑓𝑓 02 � 2 + � 𝑓𝑓∙𝑓𝑓0𝑄𝑄 � 2 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 486 The resonant frequency ( f 0 ) , quality factor ( Q ) , cantilever length ( L ) , and width ( w ) were used to 487 determine the stiffness of the cantilever ( k ) using the following relationship : 488 𝑘𝑘 𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐 = 0 . 1906 ∙ 𝜌𝜌 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑎𝑎 ∙ 𝑄𝑄 ∙ 𝑤𝑤 2 ∙ 𝐿𝐿 ∙ 𝛤𝛤 𝑏𝑏 ( 𝑓𝑓 0 , 𝑤𝑤 ) ∙ 𝑓𝑓 0 2 489 , where ρ air is the density of air at 25 ⁰C ( 1 . 18 kg / m 3 ) and Γ i ( f 0 , w ) is the imaginary component of 490 the hydrodynamic function . The photodetector sensitivity was calibrated by pressing the 491 mounted cantilever onto bare glass prior to stimulating a nearby cell and using the inverse 492 optical lever sensitivity ( invOLS ) method ( Gavara , 2017 ) : Briefly , due to the high stiffness of the 493 coverslip relative to the cantilever the slope of the relationship between the vertical difference 494 signal of the photodetector and the piezoscanner position is defined to be 1 . Thus , the inverse 495 of the measured slope equals the sensitivity . We calculated the average sensitivity from 10 496 individual measurements . All sensitivity calibrations were performed in standard recording 497 buffers prior to measuring each cell . We estimated the uncertainty in our measurements on a 498 subset of 20 cells based on the uncertainty in the fit parameters and the variance in the 499 sensitivity calibration . 500 501 AFM Stimulation of HEK293T Cells 502 22 All stimuli were applied at 5 s intervals . Prior to initial contact , a coarse step - motor moved the 503 cantilever into contact with the cell in 1 - 5 µm steps . Contact was determined by a sudden 504 increase in the photodetector signal . Following contact , the step - motor moved the cantilever 505 towards the cell in 0 . 2 - 1 µm increments until mechanotransduction currents were observed . 506 Stimuli were applied at a rate of 40 μm / s for a total distance of ~ 6 μm . The speed was chosen 507 based on initial validation experiments in HEK293T cells overexpressing Piezo1 as it was the 508 slowest speed that was able to elicit robust mechanotransduction currents of the speeds tested 509 ( 10 μm / s , 20 μm / s , 40 μm / s , 80 μm / s , 160 μm / s ) . 510 511 Electrophysiology 512 All whole - cell recordings were performed at room temperature using an EPC10 amplifier and 513 Patchmaster software ( HEKA Elektronik ) . Data were sampled at 25 kHz and filtered at 2 . 9 kHz 514 using an 8 - pole Bessel filter . Series resistance was compensated 20 - 65 % . Thin - walled 515 borosilicate glass pipettes ( 1 . 5 mm OD , 1 . 17 mm ID ; Sutter Instrument Company , Novato , CA ) 516 were pulled and wrapped in parafilm to reduce pipette capacitance . The final pipette resistance 517 was 2 . 0 - 6 . 0 M Ω when filled with pipette solution ( in mM : 133 CsCl , 0 . 5 EGTA , 10 HEPES , 1 518 MgCl 2 , 4 MgATP , 0 . 4 Na 2 GTP for Piezo1 , Piezo2 , and YFP or 133 KCl , 0 . 5 EGTA , 10 HEPES , 519 1 MgCl 2 , 4 MgATP , and 0 . 4 Na 2 GTP for TRAAK and TREK1 ) . The bath solution for experiments 520 involving Piezo1 , Piezo2 , and YFP contained in mM : 150 NaCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 521 10 Glucose , and 3 KCl ) , and the bath solution for experiments involving TRAAK or TREK1 522 contained in mM : 140 NaCl , 3 MgCl 2 , 1 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 3 KCl , 10 Glucose , and 10 TEA - Cl . 523 For TREK1 experiments using RbCl - based solutions the bath solution consisted of in mM : 140 524 NaCl , 3 MgCl 2 , 1 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 30 KCl , 10 Glucose , and 10 TEA - Cl . The pipette solution 525 for these experiments consisted of in mM : 133 RbCl , 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 0 . 5 EGTA , 4 MgATP , 526 and 0 . 4 Na 2 GTP . For bath solutions pH was adjusted to 7 . 4 and for pipette solutions 7 . 2 using 527 the hydroxide of the dominant cationic species . Osmolality was adjusted to ~ 310 for bath 528 23 solutions and ~ 290 for pipette solutions with sucrose when necessary . The internal solution was 529 allowed three minutes to dialyze prior to recording to promote GTP - mediated run - up of Piezo 530 currents ( Jia et al . , 2013 ) . Recording sessions for individual coverslips were limited to one hour . 531 532 Elasticity Measurements 533 Cell elasticity measurements were performed with gold and chromium coated cantilevers with 534 ~ 10 µm borosilicate colloids probes ( CP - qp - CONT - BSG : NanoandMore USA , Watsonville , CA ) . 535 The exact probe diameter was measured using an FEI Apreo Scanning Electron Microscope 536 ( SEM ) and averaged from the major and minor diameter of an overlayed ellipse . The cantilever 537 was calibrated as described above with the exception that only a single invOLS measurement 538 was performed at the start of each measurement . The cantilever was displaced a total distance 539 of ~ 6 μ m at a rate of 1 µm / s before being immediately retracted at the same speed . A linear fit 540 was performed on the first 20 % of the data , prior to contact , and subtracted from the trace . The 541 contact point was determined , based on visual inspection , as the inflection point of the force - 542 distance curve . A Hertzian contact model was fit to the first 1 μ m of the force - distance curve 543 following the contact point and used to estimate the elastic modulus ( E ) as follows : 544 𝐹𝐹 = 4 3 ∙ 𝐸𝐸 1 − 𝜐𝜐 2 ∙ √𝑅𝑅 ∙ 𝛿𝛿 3 2⁄ 545 , where R is the radius of the probe determined by SEM imaging , 𝜐𝜐 is the Poisson ratio taken to 546 be 0 . 5 , and 𝛿𝛿 is the indentation depth . 547 548 Analysis 549 All data were analyzed using custom analyses written in R , Python , and Julia ( Github : 550 GrandlLab ) . Cells with leak currents > 300 pA at - 80 mV or series resistances > 15 M Ω were 551 excluded from the analysis . Cells were determined to be responsive to mechanical stimuli if they 552 24 displayed stimulus - locked whole - cell currents of ≧ 50 pA . Baseline currents and photodetector 553 voltage in the absence of mechanical stimulation were subtracted offline . For TRAAK and 554 TREK1 the mechanocurrent was isolated from the voltage - dependent current by subtracting the 555 current amplitude at 0 mV . The compression force ( F ) was calculated from the baseline 556 subtracted vertical difference signal of the photodetector ( V PD ) using the following equation , 557 where S denotes the sensitivity and k cant denotes the cantilever stiffness : 558 𝐹𝐹 = 𝑉𝑉 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ∙ 𝑆𝑆 ∙ 𝑘𝑘 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 559 The distance traveled by the cantilever was corrected to account for cantilever deflection using 560 the following equation : 561 𝑑𝑑 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑑𝑑 = 𝛼𝛼 ∙ 𝑉𝑉 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑑𝑑 − 𝛿𝛿 562 , where α is the calibration factor for the piezoscanner , V command is the command voltage sent to 563 the photodetector , and δ is the deflection of the cantilever . 564 The work was determined by calculating the cumulative integral of the calculated force as a 565 function of the distance traveled by the cantilever . 566 𝑊𝑊 = ∫ 𝐹𝐹 ( 𝑑𝑑 ) ∙ 𝑑𝑑 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝜕𝜕𝑑𝑑 567 For analyses of the approach phase of each stimulus , only data during the initial ramp of the 568 cantilever was considered . 569 Transduction characteristics were determined as follows : 570 1 ) Power coefficients for individual work - current curves were determined by 571 removing data prior to the work threshold , log transforming , and performing a linear fit . 572 2 ) Work threshold ( W threshold ) values were determined as the maximum work , at 573 which the current remains below 2 standard deviations above the baseline current : 574 𝑊𝑊 { 𝐼𝐼 > 𝐼𝐼 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 + 2 ∙𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠 } 575 25 , where the standard deviation was calculated over a 100 ms window preceding stimulus 576 onset . Average values for 2 ∙ 𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑑𝑑𝑏𝑏𝑎𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑏𝑏𝑠𝑠𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏 were 4 . 0±0 . 5 pA for Piezo1 , 4 . 4±0 . 4 577 pA for Piezo2 , 7 . 5±0 . 7 pA for TRAAK , and 12 . 8±0 . 8 pA for TREK1 . Current threshold 578 values for TREK1 and TRAAK are likely slightly higher due to their higher open 579 probability at 0 mV . Current traces were passed through an additional 6 - pole Bessel filter 580 with a cutoff frequency of 1 kHz offline prior to threshold determination . 581 3 ) Work resolution ( W resolution ) values are calculated from the inverse slope ( dW / dI ) , 582 by performing a linear least square fit to the range of data corresponding to the steepest 583 region of the work - current relationship , and the following equation : 584 𝑊𝑊 𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏 = 𝑔𝑔 𝐶𝐶 ∙ ( 𝑉𝑉 𝑐𝑐 − 𝐸𝐸 𝑅𝑅 ) ∙ 𝑑𝑑𝑊𝑊 𝑑𝑑𝐼𝐼 585 using previously reported single channel conductances ( g C ) ( Piezo1 : 29 . 1 pS , Piezo2 : 586 23 . 7 pS ; ( Coste et al . , 2015 ) , TRAAK : 65 . 4 pS , TREK1 : 88 . 5 pS ; ( Blin et al . , 2016 ) . The 587 reversal potential ( E R ) was estimated to be zero for Piezo channels and the Nernst 588 potential for potassium ( - 95 mV ) in the solutions used for K2P channels . 589 4 ) Channel density was estimated using the mean current ( I v ) at 0 mV in the 590 absence of a mechanical stimulus and the membrane capacitance ( C m ) using the 591 following equation . 592 𝐷𝐷𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐𝐷𝐷 = 𝐼𝐼 𝑉𝑉 ∙ 𝐶𝐶 𝑆𝑆 𝑔𝑔 𝐶𝐶 ∙ ( 𝑉𝑉 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐸𝐸 𝑅𝑅 ) ∙ 𝐶𝐶 𝑚𝑚 593 , where g c is the respective single - channel current at the applied voltage and C S is the 594 approximate capacitivity of biological membranes of 1 µF / cm 2 ( Gentet et al . , 2000 ) . 595 5 ) The total number ( N ) of TREK1 channels was calculated using the following 596 equation : 597 𝑁𝑁 ( 𝑃𝑃 𝑂𝑂 = 1 ) = 𝐼𝐼 160 − 𝐼𝐼 𝑙𝑙𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 𝑔𝑔 𝑇𝑇𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇1 ∙ ( 𝑉𝑉 𝑚𝑚 − 𝐸𝐸 𝑅𝑅 ) 598 26 , where I 160 is the current at 160 mV , I Leak current obtained from a post hoc linear fit to 599 currents evoked by increasing negative steps from - 80 mV to - 90 mV to - 80 to - 120 mV , 600 g Trek1 the unitary conductance for TREK1 in K + buffers ( Blin et al . , 2016 ) , and E R the 601 reversal potential in Rb + buffer determined with a tail - current protocol ( Figure 4—figure 602 supplement 1 ) . 603 6 ) The number of channels activated by a mechanical stimulus ( N mech ) was 604 calculated by additionally subtracting the voltage - activated current ( I v ) at 0 mV from the 605 mechanically activated current ( I mech ) and using the following equation : 606 𝑁𝑁 𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐ℎ = 𝐼𝐼 𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑐𝑐ℎ − 𝐼𝐼 0 𝑔𝑔 𝑇𝑇𝑅𝑅𝐸𝐸𝑇𝑇 1 ∙ ( 𝑉𝑉 𝑐𝑐 − 𝐸𝐸 𝑅𝑅 ) 607 7 ) The response delay ( Δ t ) in AFM experiments was calculated as the time 608 difference between the peak of the mechanically activated current ( 𝑐𝑐 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 ) and the 609 peak of the applied force ( 𝑐𝑐 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 ) : 610 ∆𝑐𝑐 = 𝑐𝑐 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 − 𝑐𝑐 𝐹𝐹𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 611 8 ) The response delay ( Δt ) in traditional poke experiments was calculated as the 612 time difference the peak of the mechanically activated current ( 𝑐𝑐 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 ) and the peak 613 of the stimulus ramp ( 𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚𝐶𝐶𝑙𝑙𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 ) : 614 ∆𝑐𝑐 = 𝑐𝑐 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 − 𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐𝑆𝑆𝑚𝑚𝐶𝐶𝑙𝑙𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 615 All values reported are bootstrapped means±sem unless otherwise noted . All statistical 616 analyses were performed using Welch’s t - test for two group comparisons . For omnibus tests 617 Welch’s ANOVA was performed followed by a post - hoc Games - Howell test . Significance 618 thresholds correspond to : * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 005 , * * * p < 0 . 001 . Bootstrap distributions and 619 confidence intervals were determined using the bias - corrected and accelerated bootstrapping 620 27 method except where SEM is reported in which case percentile bootstrap distributions were 621 used . All bootstrapping was done with > = 10 , 000 replicate . 622 623 Markov model simulations 624 Channel gating was simulated with a custom - written script using Python available on GitHub 625 ( Github : Grandllab ) . Piezo1 channels were distributed randomly on a grid with 10 nm x 10 nm 626 pixel - size . The grid size was adjusted for each simulation to minimize simulation time and to 627 ensure tension at the edge never exceeded 5 % of the maximal tension amplitude to minimize 628 boundary effects . Pixel occupancy was approximately 1 % , corresponding to the experimentally 629 obtained channel density of Piezo1 overexpressed in Neuro2A cells of 100 channels / μm 2 ( Lewis 630 and Grandl , 2021 ) . Gating of each individual Piezo1 channel was simulated with a four - state 631 Markov - model ( Figure 7C ) as previously described and adapted to be a function of membrane 632 tension ( σ ) ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ; Lewis et al . , 2017 ; Young et al . , 2022 ) . Specifically , rate 633 constants for wild - type Piezo1 ( σ 50 = 1 . 4 mN / m , slope factor b = 0 . 8 mN / m ) were k 1 ( σ ) = 634 5 . 1·exp ( σ / b ) s - 1 , k - 1 = 5·exp ( σ 50 / b ) s - 1 , k 2 = 8 . 0 s - 1 , k - 2 = 0 . 4 s - 1 , k 3 ( σ ) = 34 . 6·exp ( - σ / b ) s - 1 , k 4 = 635 4 . 0 s - 1 , k - 4 = 0 . 6 s - 1 , where σ is the applied tension , and k - 3 = ( k 1 ·k 2 ·k 3 ) / ( k - 1 ·k - 2 ) to achieve 636 microscopic reversibility . Sampling intervals ( dt ) were adjusted such that dt < < 1 / k 1 ( σ ) at all 637 times and ranged from 0 . 1 to 10 μ s . Equilibrium occupancies , at σ = 0 , were determined 638 analytically and used as starting values . Each simulation was allowed an additional 50 ms at σ = 639 0 to ensure complete equilibration , before the tension stimulus was applied . At t = 50 ms a 640 circular tension stimulus with radius = 4 μ m ( 200 pixels ) was applied . Propagation of membrane 641 tension was calculated with a 2D - Gaussian diffusion function ( Figure 7B ) : 642 𝜎𝜎 ( 𝑎𝑎 , 𝑐𝑐 ) = 𝜎𝜎 𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 ∙ 𝑏𝑏 � −𝑟𝑟 2 4𝑃𝑃∙𝑐𝑐� 4 𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷 ∙ 𝑐𝑐 643 644 28 , where σ max is the maximal tension amplitude , D the diffusion coefficient , r is the distance of the 645 channel from the edge of the stimulus , and t is the time after stimulus onset . Initially , 1 s 646 simulations were performed to validate the baseline current , peak current , inactivation kinetics , 647 plateau current matched expected values .
