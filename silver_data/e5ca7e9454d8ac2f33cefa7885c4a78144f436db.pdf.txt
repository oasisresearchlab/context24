Biological studies have shown that a fresh booster leads to increased antibody levels compared to a fresh 2 - dose vaccine , which may suggest increased effectiveness . To compare the real - world effectiveness of a fresh booster dose with that of a fresh 2 - dose vaccine , we conduct a quasi - experimental study that compares populations that were eligible to receive the vaccine at different times due to age cutoff policies . Our analysis shows that a fresh booster increases protection against confirmed infection by 3 . 7 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 7 to 5 . 2 ) fold compared to a fresh 2 - dose vaccine . 1 All rights reserved .

Main Following observations of waning in the protection conferred by the BNT162b2 ( Pfizer - BioNTech ) vaccine , 1 Israel began the administration of a third ( BNT162b2 booster ) dose on July 30 , 2021 to individuals 60 years or older . Starting August 29 , 2021 , every person aged 16 or older who was vaccinated for at least 5 months was eligible to receive a booster dose . Population studies have shown that the booster is highly effective in restoring protection against infection , reducing the rate of confirmed infections and severe outcomes by several folds compared to doubly - vaccinated individuals 5 months after vaccination . 2 – 4 Laboratory studies showed that a BNT162b2 booster dose significantly increased the antibody neutralization and the IgG titers levels compared to a second dose , 5 , 6 which suggests possible increased protection , as increased neutralization titer could lead to increased protection against infection . 7 , 8 We sought to compare the real - world effectiveness of a “fresh” BNT162b2 booster dose in preventing infection to that of a “fresh” 2 - dose BNT162b2 vaccine . However , comparing the effectiveness of the booster dose with that of two “fresh” doses is challenging due to selection bias . Individuals who received the booster dose chose to vaccinate earlier , which has been shown to be correlated with high sociodemographic status . 9 To mitigate this bias , we use a quasi - experimental study . 10 In Israel , residents aged 16 or older were eligible to vaccinate starting February 2021 , while teenagers aged 12 - 15 became eligible to receive the vaccine only in June 2021 . We utilize the change in the age cutoff to compare the protection conferred by a fresh 2 - dose vaccine to that conferred by a fresh booster dose . The quasi - experimental study is not bias - free as a controlled experiment , as prior to the vaccination campaign , the younger age group had a somewhat lower rate of confirmed infections than the 16 - 18 group , which is in line with prior studies showing lower infectivity and susceptibility in younger children . 11 On the other hand , following the vaccination campaign , the older age group might have a higher indirect protection from being in an environment with higher vaccination rates . We discuss possible biases resulting from the different ages in the two cohorts in the Supplementary Appendix , as well as several sensitivity analyses exploring the magnitude of the biases . We also present a secondary analysis comparing protection of the cohorts to unvaccinated individuals in corresponding age groups . Our main analysis compared the rates of confirmed infections between September 12 , 2021 and October 9 , 2021 ( 4th wave in Israel , which was Delta - dominant ) in two cohorts : individuals aged 16 - 18 who received the booster dose and individuals aged 12 - 14 who were recently vaccinated ( 2 doses ) . Individuals in both cohorts chose to vaccinate soon after becoming eligible . For the doubly - vaccinated cohort , we only included persons who were vaccinated for less than 60 days to avoid the effect of waning immunity . 1 We used a Poisson regression ( see Supplementary Appendix ) to estimate the confirmed infection rates in the two cohorts during the four - week study period . We did not analyze protection against severe disease as there were only a few cases . The analysis shows that a fresh booster dose provides a 3 . 7 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 7 - 5 . 2 ) fold increase in protection against confirmed infection compared to a fresh 2 - dose vaccine ( see Figure 1 ) .

Our results show that a fresh booster dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine provides improved protection against confirmed infection compared to fresh two doses of the same vaccine . These results are in line with lab - based findings showing increased antibody responses both in the IgG titers as well as neutralizing antibody levels of the booster dose . 5 Moreover , the neutralizing antibodies after the booster were superior in neutralization assay to antibodies after a second dose against both Delta and Omicron . 12 – 14 Together , these findings offer a scientific basis for the inclusion of a booster dose as part of the BNT162b2 regimen .

During the third wave , Israel initiated a very rapid vaccination campaign administering the BNT162b2 vaccine to all adult residents . The campaign was opened on December 20 , 2020 , initially to people aged 60 years or older , and was then gradually extended until , on February 4 , 2021 , all individuals aged 16 or older were eligible to receive two doses of the vaccine . After the arrival of the Delta variant to Israel , a new Covid - 19 wave began in mid - June 2021 . Consequently , on July 30 , 2021 , the administration of a third ( booster ) dose was approved , first for people aged 60 years or older , and later for younger age groups . 2 Israel has a centralized health system , where each resident belongs to one of four health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) . Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) tests for SARS - CoV - 2 infections as well as vaccination against the virus are provided free of charge , and are directly reported to the Ministry of Health ( MoH ) . The MoH established a centralized Covid - 19 national database containing regularly updated information on all PCR tests and results , vaccination dates , and follow - up data on all infected individuals , including the severity of disease and mortality . The MoH database also includes basic demographic information , such as sex , age , place of residency , and population sector . Study Design and Population We used a quasi - experimental design , utilizing the changes made to the vaccine eligibility age cutoffs to estimate the effectiveness of a booster dose to that of a “fresh” 2 - dose vaccine . The study population included persons who were between the ages of 12 - 14 or 16 - 18 starting January 1st , had no documented positive PCR result prior to the study period , had not stayed abroad during the whole study period , and had not been vaccinated with a vaccine different from BNT162b2 before the end of the study period . We did not include the 15 - year - old group since the data includes the age of individuals in one - year groups ( based on their age on January 1st , 2021 ) , and the 15 - year - old group thus includes individuals who were eligible to vaccinate at different times . In the primary analysis , the study population was divided into two cohorts . The first cohort included individuals 16 - 18 who recently received the booster dose , and the second cohort included individuals aged 12 - 14 who were doubly vaccinated for less than 60 days ( to avoid waning effects ) . To estimate protection conferred by the 2 - dose and the booster vaccines , we compared their infection rates during the four - week study period : September 12 , 2021 and October 9 , 2021 ( 4th wave in Israel , which was Delta - dominant ) . In a secondary analysis , we also included a third cohort consisting of individuals aged 16 - 18 who were doubly vaccinated for less than 60 days . In this analysis , we used unvaccinated 2 All rights reserved .

Statistical Analysis We analyzed the data using a methodology similar to that used in our previous studies . 2 , 3 The number of confirmed infections and the number of days at risk during the study period were counted for each cohort . A Poisson regression model was fitted adjusting for age ( by year ) , sex , population group ( General Jewish , Arab , ultra - Orthodox Jewish ) , calendar week , and an exposure risk measure . The latter was calculated for each person on each follow - up day according to the proportion of new confirmed infections during the past seven days in their area of residence ; this continuous measure was then divided into ten categories according to deciles ( see Bar - On et al . 2 for details ) . An average risk was imputed to individuals with missing data on residency . Secondary analysis - comparison with unvaccinated and 16 - 18 vaccinated In the primary quasi - experimental analysis , biases may occur due to age differences , either because natural protection is correlated with age , or due to behavioral differences . Our secondary analysis compared the protection against confirmed infection between three cohorts : individuals aged 16 - 18 who received the booster dose , individuals aged 12 - 14 who were recently vaccinated ( 2 doses ) , and a new cohort of individuals aged 16 - 18 who were recently vaccinated ( 2 doses ) . The 12 - 14 vaccinated group is similar to the booster group in that they chose to vaccinate soon after becoming eligible . However , due to the age difference , this group also seems to be more exposed than the 16 - 18 group according to infections among unvaccinated individuals ( see Figure S2 ) . The 16 - 18 vaccinated cohort presumably has a similar exposure risk as that of the 16 - 18 unvaccinated cohort and does not suffer from this bias , but could introduce a behavioral bias as they were vaccinated relatively late . To measure protection , we use unvaccinated individuals as a reference group , and estimate , using a Poisson regression ( see Statistical Analysis ) , the protection of each cohort compared to the corresponding unvaccinated age group during the four - week study period : September 12 , 2021 and October 9 , 2021 ( 4th wave in Israel , which was Delta - dominant ) . The analysis shows that the booster provides a 2 – 3 fold increase in protection against confirmed infection compared to a fresh 2 - dose vaccine ( see Figure S3 ) . Infection rates in the booster cohort were 26 . 3 - fold ( 95 % CI : 19 . 2 , 36 ) lower than in the corresponding unvaccinated group . In the vaccinated 12 - 14 cohort , the increase in protection was 2 . 1 - fold lower than in the booster cohort , with a 12 . 5 - fold ( 95 % CI : 11 . 2 , 13 . 8 ) reduction in infections compared to the unvaccinated group of that age . The increase in protection in the vaccinated 16 - 18 cohort was 2 . 7 - fold lower than in the booster group , with a rate of infections 9 . 8 - fold ( 95 % CI : 5 , 16 ) lower than in the unvaccinated group . Sensitivity analyses We conducted several sensitivity analyses . First , the 17 - 18 age group comprises individuals who graduated from school prior to the study period . Therefore , they may differ from the 3 All rights reserved .

Indeed , we observed lower infection rates in general in the 17 - 18 year old unvaccinated age group . We therefore repeated the analysis removing this age group , and also compared only vaccinated 14 year old individuals with 16 year old individuals in the booster cohort , who are the closest age groups within these cohorts . These analyses show a 3 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 2 , 6 . 1 ) fold increase in protection for a fresh booster dose compared to a fresh 2 - dose vaccine when removing the 17 - 18 year old age group , and a 4 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 5 , 8 . 1 ) increase when comparing only 16 year old ( booster ) with 14 year old ( doubly - vaccinated ) . Second , because booster uptake rates are higher in the General Jewish population , we conducted an additional analysis which only included this sub - population . This analysis shows a 4 . 1 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 8 , 6 . 2 ) fold improved protection for a fresh booster dose . Lastly , we analyzed confirmed infection rates over a longer study period - from September 12 to Oct 24 , resulting in an estimate of a 3 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 4 , 5 . 2 ) increase in protection for the booster cohort . This analysis adds more individuals and confirmed infection events , but also includes individuals who were doubly - vaccinated later . Overall , all sensitivity analyses yielded similar results , with a fresh booster dose providing an estimated 3 – 5 fold increase in protection compared to fresh two doses . Study Limitations The study has several limitations . We observe different confirmed infection rates for unvaccinated individuals in different age groups ( see Figure S2 ) with higher rates up to age 16 and lower rates from age 17 and above . These differences are possibly related to the 17 + age groups graduating from school prior to the study period , which could affect their exposure and testing rates , but could also relate to different characteristics of the unvaccinated population at different ages . To account for this bias , we adjust for age by year in the regression . In a secondary analysis , we also included the vaccinated 16 - 18 cohort which is similar to the booster cohort with respect to age . However , this group is different in that they vaccinated later , as opposed to the booster cohort which consists of individuals who were early to vaccinate . This can reflect differences between the populations as shown in prior studies . 9 Furthermore , prior studies have shown that younger adolescents might be less susceptible to infection than older individuals . 11 We also observe this when examining the relevant age groups in the period of Oct - Dec 2020 ( pre - Alpha dominant period in Israel ) , prior to their eligibility to vaccinate , where the 12 – 14 group had a lower confirmed infection rate than the 16 – 17 group by a factor of 0 . 8 . This suggests that part of the protection in the older population in our study stems from their environment being more protected ( higher vaccination rates ) . To address these biases we compare the booster cohort both with the vaccinated 12 - 14 cohort and the vaccinated 16 - 18 cohort , using the unvaccinated cohort in the corresponding age groups as a baseline reference . We also conducted sensitivity analyses with respect to the age groups . We note that the unvaccinated group likely includes a substantial number of undocumented recovered individuals . 16 4 All rights reserved .

To account for this , we examine the number of PCR tests performed by individuals in the different cohorts ( see Figure S4 ) . We find that the vaccinated 12 - 14 cohort and the booster cohort have similar testing rates . Related to the secondary analysis which also included the vaccinated 16 - 18 cohort , we observe a somewhat lower testing rate in this group , suggesting that their protection might be overestimated . We also observe that the unvaccinated population in the 12 - 14 age group ( used as a reference in the secondary analysis ) were tested at a higher rate than the vaccinated 12 - 14 cohort and also at a higher rate than the unvaccinated 16 - 18 age group . Since the protection rates use the unvaccinated groups as reference , it is possible that the protection of the vaccinated 12 - 14 group is overestimated . Therefore , the increase in protection conferred by a booster dose compared to two doses might be even higher than estimated in our analysis . Another limitation of the study is that individuals in the booster cohort chose to vaccinate early ( similar to the 12 - 14 vaccinated cohort ) and also chose to receive the booster dose , leading to a potential selection bias in the booster population . In particular , the General Jewish population had a higher uptake rate of the booster dose . Therefore , we conducted a sensitivity analysis including only this sector . We also conducted a sensitivity analysis extending the study period by two weeks , which includes a higher number of individuals who received the booster dose . Lastly , we note that our estimates for protection reflect the real - world effectiveness of the vaccine and likely include indirect effects such as the added protection due to others being vaccinated , and not only the biological protection conferred by the vaccine . Nevertheless , all the sensitivity analyses we conducted showed that protection against confirmed infection after receiving the booster dose was substantially higher than that after two doses , suggesting that the booster dose indeed improves protection beyond that of only two doses . 5 All rights reserved .
