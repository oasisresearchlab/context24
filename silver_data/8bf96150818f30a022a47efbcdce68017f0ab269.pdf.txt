Here , we demonstrate a novel interaction between the Abl - interactor ( Abi ) and the BRAG family member Schizo . We mapped the SH3 domain of Abi to interact with the N - terminal region of Schizo . This region is additionally involved in the binding of the cytodomain of the cell adhesion molecule N - cadherin . In schizo loss of function mutants , we detected increased amounts of N - cadherin . In contrast , the expression of the GEF ( Sec7 ) and the membrane - binding ( pleckstrin homology ) domains decreased amounts of N - cadherin , indicating a crucial role of the Sec7 - PH module in regulating N - cadherin levels . Unlike other Sec7 GEFs , where the catalytic Sec7 domain is autoinhibited , the Sec7 and PH domain of BRAG2 are constitutively accessible , raising the question how GEF activity is controlled in a spatial and temporal manner . Our genetic analyzes demonstrate that the nature of the Abi Schizo interaction is to antagonize Schizo function and to restore wild - type amounts of N - cadherin . 3 Introduction BRAG proteins are a subgroup of the Arf - guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) family that are mandatory for developmental and physiological processes , e . g . myoblast fusion , neuronal pathfinding and synaptic transmission . However , they also play an important role during disease progression , e . g . cancer metastasis and X - chromosome – linked intellectual disability ( D’Souza and Casanova , 2016 ) . The BRAG family is characterized by an N - terminal located calmodulin - binding IQ motif , a catalytic Sec7 domain of ~ 200 amino acids and a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain that is immediately located downstream of the Sec7 domain . The Sec7 domain stimulates the release of GDP to allow binding of GTP on ADF - ribosylation factor ( Arf ) family members . These Arf GTPases serve as master regulators of intracellular membrane traffic and actin dynamics . A primary challenge in understanding the activation of small GTPases in development , tissue homeostasis and disease , is to study the molecular mechanism underlying GEF activation . The human GEFs for Arf family proteins are grouped into six evolutionarily conserved families known as BIG , BRAG / IQSec , Cytohesins , EFA6 / PSD , FBX8 and GBFs . Arf GEFs of the Cytohesin and BIG family are regulated by auto - inhibition ( DiNitto et al . , 2007 ; Stadler et al . , 2011 ; Richardson et al . , 2012 ) . The GEF activity of Cytohesin is suppressed through the Sec7 - PH linker and the C - terminal helix / polybasic region that mask the active side in the Sec7 domain ( DiNitto et al . , 2007 ) . The auto - inhibition of the yeast BIG family member Sec7 depends on an intramolecular interaction that involves the HSD domains ( Richardson et al . , 2012 ) . Auto - inhibition is released by the binding of membrane - bound Arf - GTP to the PH domain or the HSD1 domain . A positive feedback loop arises through the generation of more Arf - GTP by the Sec7 GEF , which leads to the recruitment of more Arf GEF . In contrast , high resolution crystal structure of the unbound Sec7 - PH domain of the Sec7 GEF BRAG2 revealed that the lipid binding side in the PH domain and the Arf - binding site in the Sec7 domain are both constitutively active ( Karandur et al . , 2017 ) . The finding that the Sec7 and PH domain are constantly accessible for protein - protein and protein - membrane interactions raises the question how the spatial - temporal activation of BRAG2 is achieved . The Drosophila BRAG family member Schizo is required for the guidance of neuronal axons ( Önel et al . , 2004 ) and muscle development ( Chen et al . , 2003 , Dottermusch - Heidel et al . , 2012 ) . Muscles are multinucleated cells that arise by the fusion of mono - nucleated myoblasts . Despite muscle formation , myoblast fusion is crucial for the maintainance , growth and repair of muscles in mammals and Drosophila ( Abmayr and Pavlath , 2012 ; Chaturvedi et al . , 2017 ) . However , the precise function of Schizo during myoblast fusion is still unknown . 4 Rescue experiments with Drosophila Arf1 , Arf2 and Arf6 that represent the three classes of mammalian Arf GTPases ( Donaldson and Jackson , 2011 ) , suggest that Schizo acts through the Arf1 - GTPase ( Dottermusch - Heidel et al . , 2012 ) . In a global yeast two - hybrid screen the cell adhesion molecule N - cadherin was identified as Schizo interaction partner ( Dottermusch - Heidel et al . , 2012 ) . Genetic interaction studies revealed that the schizo myoblast fusion phenotype is suppressed by the loss of N - cadherin . Based on these findings we proposed that the removal of N - cadherin brings the apposing myoblast membranes into close proximity to allow membranes to fuse . In this study , we have analyzed the function of the N - terminal domain of Schizo . Our data demonstrates that the N - terminal domain is essential for the localization of the Schizo protein to the plasma membrane and the regulation of amounts of N - cadherin . Consistently , the exclusive expression of the Sec7 PH domain of Schizo , which represents an active form of the GEF , reduces amounts of N - cadherin . Finally , we have addressed by which mechanism amounts of N - cadherin are regulated . The finding that Schizo acts through the Arf1 - GTPases prompted us to investigate whether CLIC / GEEC endocytosis is involved in the removal of N - cadherin . CLIC / GEEC endocytosis depends on the RhoGAP protein Graf - 1 . However , neither the deletion of graf - 1 by CRISPR / Cas9 nor the expression of truncated Graf - 1 showed increased amounts of N - cadherin as observed in schizo mutants . Instead , we found that the Scar / WAVE complex member Abi binds to the N - terminal region of Schizo . Abi , but not Scar / WAVE , antagonizes Schizo function in a dosage - dependent manner . These findings provide a new conceptual framework for the regulation of Schizo activity . Results The N - terminal region of Schizo is important for protein localization schizo encodes for two Arf GEFs ( Schizo P1 and Schizo P2 ) that only differ in the first 12 amino acids at their N - terminal region and share all the conserved domains ( Önel et al . , 2004 ) . These Schizo proteins correspond to the Loner isoforms Iso1 and Iso2 that have been described by Chen et al . ( 2003 ) . In Dottermusch - Heidel et al . ( 2012 ) we screened a Drosophila yeast two - hybrid cDNA library with the first 753 amino acids of Schizo P2 and identified N - cadherin as interaction partner . To determine whether the N - terminal region of Schizo is important for Schizo P2 localization , we placed the wild - type schizo cDNA LP01489 and schizo lacking the first 2 , 3 kb of the schizo ORF under the control of UAS activating sequences . The full - length Schizo protein P2 Siz 1 - 1313 , the Schizo protein Siz 1 - 753 from the yeast - two hybrid screen and Siz 753 - 1313 lacking the first 2 , 3 kb of the LP01489 schizo cDNA are shown in Fig . 1A . GFP - tagged Siz 1 - 1313 and Siz 753 - 1313 were expressed in the 5 mesoderm and in somatic muscle cells with the Mef - GAL4 driver . In the mesoderm of stage 10 embryos , Siz 1 - 1313 and N - cadherin are both present at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1B – B’’ arrow ) , but Siz 1 - 1313 is also detectable in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 1 B – B’’ asterisks and D – D’’ ) . In contrast , Siz 753 - 1313 lacking the N - terminal region is only detectable in the cytoplasma and not at the plasma membrane like observed for Siz 1 - 1313 ( Fig . 1C – C’’ ) . In somatic muscles Siz 753 - 1313 is expressed in a very specific pattern ( Fig . 1E’ and E’’ arrows ) . This pattern is reminiscent of the Mef2 transcription factor , which is expressed in the nuclei of muscle cells ( Bour et al . , 1995 ) . To confirm the different localization of Siz 1 - 1313 full - length and truncated Siz 753 - 1313 , both proteins were expressed in Drosophila S2R + Schneider cells ( Fig . 1 F , F’ , G , G’ and Expanded View Movie EV1 ) . Siz 1 - 1313 is distributed in the cytoplasm of S2R + cells in a punctuated manner ( Fig . 1 F and F’ ) . Surprisingly , Siz 753 - 1313 is present in the nucleus where it colocalizes with DAPi ( Fig . 1G and G’ ) . The import of proteins into the nucleus depends on a short peptide sequences called nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) sequences . To analyze whether Schizo P2 contains such NLS sequences , we have performed a data bank search as described by Lin and Hu ( 2013 ) and identified two predicted NLS sequences in Siz 1 - 1313 ( Fig . 1A ) . One of these predicted NLS sequences is located in the Sec7 domain of Schizo P2 and is still present in Siz 753 - 1313 . However , the expression of Siz 753 - 1313 in the mesoderm of wild - type embryos and its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling does not disturb myoblast fusion . Taken together , these results show that the N - terminal region of Schizo P2 is essential for the localization of the Schizo protein to the plasma membrane . In the absence of this region Schizo translocate to the nucleus although the Sec7 and PH domain that mediate lipid binding are still present . N - cadherin amounts are increased in homozygous schizo mutant embryos Schizo function is required in the two types of Drosophila myoblasts : founder cells ( FCs ) and fusion - competent myoblasts ( FCMs ) ( Dottermusch - Heidel et al . , 2012 ) , where it interacts with N - cadherin ( Fig . 2A ) . The loss of Schizo function leads to severe defects in myoblast fusion ( Fig . 2A’ and A’’ ) . In the CNS , schizo mutants lack commissural axons ( Fig . 2 B’ and B’’ , arrows ) due to increased levels of the axon guidance molecule Slit ( Önel et al . , 2004 ) . To assess the importance of the Sec7 and PH domain for Schizo P2 function , we generated Siz -  Sec7 and Siz -  PH deletion mutants . Expression of Siz 1 - 1313 in the mesoderm with twist - GAL4 rescues the myoblast fusion phenotype ( Fig . 2E ) , whereas homozygous mutants expressing Siz -  Sec7 or Siz -  PH in their mesoderm still showed a myoblast fusion 6 phenotype ( Fig . 2F and G ) . These data confirm that the Sec7 and PH domains are both pivotal for Schizo function . However , the question remained whether the Sec7 - PH module is crucial for regulating amounts of N - cadherin . To address this question , we first elevated the amount of N - cadherin in homozygous schizo mutants and in embryos expressing dominant - negative Arf1 ( ArfT31N ) by using two different approaches . Consistent with our previous hypothesis that was based on genetic interaction studies , we observed increased amounts of N - cadherin in whole - mount embryos ( Fig . 3A’ , A’’ , B’ , B’’ , C’ and C’’ ) . To analyze the amount of N - cadherin , we used cytofluorograms of single embryos ( Fig . 3A’’ , B’’ and C’’ ) and measured the fluorescence intensity from 6 to 15 embryos ( Fig . 3F ) . The activity of the Schizo homologue BRAG2 that only possesses the Sec7 - PH module has been shown to possess a 10 - fold higher activity towards Arf1 and a 15 – 20 - fold higher activity in the presence of PIP 2 ( Jian et al . , 2012 ; Aizel et al . , 2013 ) . Conversely , to investigate whether an increased activity of Schizo is able to decrease amounts of N - cadherin in whole mount - embryos , we generated Siz - Sec7 - PH 753 - 1081 transgenic flies ( Fig . 3D ) . The expression of Siz - Sec7 - PH 753 - 1081 in muscles with Mef - GAL4 leads to severe defects in myoblast fusion ( Fig . 3E , E’ ) . Furthermore , we observed a punctated distribution of Siz - Sec7 - PH 753 - 1081 in myoblasts , which was not observed with Siz 1 - 1313 ( Fig . 3E’’ ; Fig . 1B – B’’ and D – D’’ ) . Additionally , we examined the N - cadherin fluorescence intensity of embryos expressing Sec7 - PH 753 - 1081 in the mesoderm with twist - GAL4 or with Mef - GAL4 in muscle cells . With both GAL4 drivers , we observed decreased amount of N - cadherin ( Fig . 3G ) . These data show that the Schizo full - length protein is required for the removal of N - cadherin and that Schizo - Sec7 - PH 753 - 1081 represents an activated form of Schizo . The Scar / WAVE complex member Abi interacts physically with the RhoGAP protein Graf - 1 and Schizo The finding that amounts of N - cadherin are increased in homozygous schizo mutants and the punctuated distribution of Schizo - Sec7 - PH 753 - 1081 in muscles , prompted us to investigate whether Schizo controls N - cadherin amounts by endocytosis . The observation that the schizo mutant phenotype can be rescued by GTP - bound Arf1 suggests that Schizo acts via Arf1 ( Dottermusch - Heidel et al . , 2012 ) . Consistently , we detect a transient colocalization between Siz 1 - 1313 and Arf1 in Drosophila S2R + cells ( Appendix Fig . S1 ) . The small Arf1 - GTPase is involved in the endocytosis of lipid - anchored proteins such as GPI - APs and does not involve Dynamin . The endocytotic structures are termed GEECs ( GPI - AP enriched early endosomal 7 compartments ) . The molecular mechanism of this pathway is initiated by the recruitment of the Sec7 GEF GBF1 , which activates Arf1 ( Gupta et al . , 2009 ) . Arf1 recruits the RhoGAP protein Graf - 2 ( alias ARHGAP10 , alias ARHGAP21 ) to the cell surface ( Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ) . The activity of this protein complex promotes GTP - hydrolysis on Cdc42 , which is necessary for the endocytosis process . Additionally , Graf - 1 ( alias ARHGAP26 ) has been described to colocalize with activated Cdc42 and controls like Graf - 2 Cdc42 activity ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . During muscle development , the down - regulation of Graf - 1 in murine C2C12 cells or the loss of Graf - 1 or Graf - 2 in primary myoblasts significantly reduces the capability of myoblasts to fuse ( Doherty et al . , 2011 ; Lenhart et al . , 2014 ) . Due to the role of Graf in GEEC endocytosis and its role in mammalian myoblast fusion , we examined Graf function in Drosophila . Drosophila Graf - 1 contains like the mammalian Graf proteins a BAR , PH , RhoGAP and SH3 domain ( Kim et al . , 2017 ) ( Fig . EV1A ) . To determine whether Drosophila Graf - 1 is involved in the removal of N - cadherin , we first performed protein interaction studies between Graf - 1 and Schizo and the intracellular domain of N - cadherin . Although we did not detect any interaction between Graf - 1 full - length and N - cadherin , we found that Graf - 1 lacking the BAR domain interacted with the intracellular domain of N - cadherin ( Fig . EV1A , Table 1 , Appendix Fig . S2 ) . The BAR domain of mammalian Graf - 1 has been shown to directly interact with the GAP domain to inhibit its activity ( Eberth et al . , 2009 ) . We assume that the failed interaction between Graf - 1 full - length and the intracellular domain of N - cadherin is caused by the autoinhibited conformation of Graf - 1 . Domain mapping experiments revealed that the SH3 domain of Graf - 1 is responsible for the interaction of Graf  BAR with the intracellular domain of N - cadherin ( Fig . EV1A , Appendix Fig . S3 ) . However , we found no protein interactions between Graf - 1 and Schizo in the yeast - two hybrid assay . Graf - 1 - eGFP is distributed in a punctuated manner in Drosophila S2R + cells ( Fig . EV1B and C ) and partially colocalizes with Schizo and GTP - bound Arf1 ( Fig . EV1D and E ) . To determine whether Graf is involved in the removal of N - cadherin , we utilized the CRISPR / Cas9 strategy to generate graf deletion mutants ( Fig . EV1F ) . Although , we identified small deletions in the BAR domain of graf , homozygous graf mutants were viable and showed no defects in myoblast fusion ( Fig . EV1G and H ) . In addition , we quantified amounts of N - cadherin in homozygous graf mutants and overexpressed UAS - graf  BAR and UAS - grafDBAR  SH3 with Mef - GAL4 in wildtype embryos ( Fig . EVA1 I ) . However , we failed to observe increased amounts of N - cadherin . Based on these findings , we propose that Graf - 1 - dependent endocytosis is not essential for N - cadherin removal . 8 The actin polymerization machinery has been implicated to aid in clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Chadda et al . , 2007 ; Römer et al . , 2010 ; Sathe et al . , 2018 ) . Indeed , actin polymerization seems to be a key step to power local membrane deformation and carrier budding in clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Hinze and Boucrot , 2018 ) . Since Arp2 / 3 - and Formin - dependent F - actin polymerization is essential for the fusion of myoblasts ( Kim et al . , 2007 ; Massarwa et al . , 2007 ; Richardson et al . , 2007 ; Schäfer et al . , 2007 ; Berger et al . , 2008 ; Deng et al . , 2015 ) , we determined whether members of the Arp2 / 3 activation machinery or the formin Diaphanous interact with Schizo ( Table 1 ) . Surprisingly , we identified Abi , a component of the Scar / WAVE complex , to interact with Schizo and Graf - 1 ( Table 1 , Fig . 4 and Appendix Fig . 4 ) . The SH3 domain of Abi interacts with the N - terminal region of Schizo We next mapped the interaction domain on Abi by testing deletion mutants of Abi for binding to full - length Siz 1 - 1313 . Full - length Abi and the deletion mutant proteins examined are depicted schematically in Figure 4A . The deletion of the carboxy - terminal SH3 domain eliminated the interaction with Schizo Siz 1 - 1313 ( Fig . 4A ) . Subsequently , we performed the converse experiment and only used the SH3 domain of Abi for determining the interaction with Schizo ( Fig . 4A and C ) . These data indicate that the SH3 domain is mandatory for the observed interaction . To identify the interaction domain on Schizo , we utilized the deletion mutant proteins illustrated in Figure 4B . Abi full - length interacts with Siz 1 - 323 , Siz 753 - 972 , Siz 972 - 1313 and Siz 1 - 753 . As demonstrated in the controls , Siz 972 - 1313 shows a false positive interaction with the empty pBGKT7 vector . By using the SH3 domain of Abi as bait protein , we could confirm the interaction of Siz 1 - 323 , Siz 972 - 1313 and Siz 1 - 753 , but not with Siz 753 - 972 . From these data , we concluded that the N - terminal region of Schizo from 1 – 753 amino acid is responsible for interacting with Abi . Because of the observed protein interaction , we next transfected Drosophila S2R + cells with UAS - siz - mcherry and UAS - abi - eGFP to determine the distribution of both proteins in Schneider cells . We found that UAS - abi - eGFP colocalizes with full - length UAS - schizo - mcherry and that both proteins are distributed in a punctuated manner ( Appendix Fig . S5 and Expanded View Movie EV2 ) . Abi and Schizo serve antagonistic functions The observation that Abi and Schizo colocalizes in a punctuated manner raises the question whether Abi and Schizo act in concert to regulate amounts of N - cadherin by endocytosis . To determine whether both proteins contribute to the same process , we performed epistasis 9 experiments and used meitotic recombination to generate schizo abi double mutants . In a first attempt we analyzed the muscle phenotype of the hypomorphic schizo allele siz C1 - 028 , the abi null allele abi  20 and siz C1 - 028 abi  20 double mutants ( Fig . 5Aa – e ) . We observed that homozygous siz C1 - 028 abi  20 double mutants show a strong myoblast fusion phenotype like siz C1 - 028 ( Fig . 5Ad and Ab ) . The muscle phenotype of abi  20 null mutants is comparable to the wild - type muscle pattern ( Fig . 5Ac and Aa ) , but some muscles are missing . If schizo and abi both contribute in regulating amounts of N - cadherin , we expected to enhance the abi muscle phenotype by reducing the schizo gene dose . However , the musculature of transheterozygous abi  20 / Df ( abi ) mutants lacking one copy of schizo look like the musculature of homozygous abi  20 mutant embryos ( Fig . Ae and Ac ) . From the myoblast fusion phenotype of the epistasis experiments we cannot conclude whether schizo and abi contribute together in regulating amounts of N - cadherin . To verifty , we determined amounts of N - cadherin in homozygous siz C1 - 028 , abi  20 / Df ( abi ) single and siz C1 - 028 abi  20 double mutants . Figure 5Af shows the measurement of the N - cadherin fluorescence intensity from 5 to 12 embryos . Interestingly , we found that amounts of N - cadherin are reduced to wild - type levels in homozygous siz C1 - 028 abi  20 double mutant embryos . The reduced amounts of N - cadherin in the double mutants indicate that schizo and abi might act antagonistically . Further support for this notion comes from the analyses of the central nervous phenotype with anti - N - cadherin ( Fig . 5Ba – f ) . N - cadherin is not only expressed in the mesoderm and during myoblast fusion , but also shows a strong expression in the central nervous cord ( Iwai et al . , 1997 ) . When we imaged siz C1 - 028 abi  20 double mutants to determine the fluorescence intensity of N - cadherin , we noticed that the commissural phenotype of homozygous schizo mutants ( Fig . 5Bb arrowheads ) is suppressed in some hemisegments of siz C1 - 028 abi  20 double mutants ( Fig . 5Bd arrowheads ) . Abi is a member of the Scar / WAVE complex , which is required for the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex that nucleates branched F - actin filaments ( Rotty et al . , 2014 ) . The nucleation ability of the Arp2 / 3 complex depends on nucleation promoting factors of the WASp family to which Scar / WAVE belongs to ( Tyler et al . , 2016 ) . Besides its function as member of the Scar / WAVE complex , Abi is also known to interact physically with WASp ( Bogdan and Klämbt , 2003 ) . The finding that abi antagonizes schizo during myoblast fusion and commissural formation suggests that also other members of the Scar / WAVE complex , e . g . scar / wave counteract schizo . To test this assumption , we generated scar siz double mutants by using the hypomorphic scar allele scar k13811 . Commissures are reduced in the siz alleles siz C1 - 028 ( Fig . 2A , Fig . 5Bb arrowheads ) . In homozygous scar k13811 mutants , commissures are not reduced , but both commissures are sometimes observed in close 10 proximity ( Fig . 5Be arrowheads ) . In contrast , we found that the commissural phenotype of homozygous siz C1 - 028 mutant embryos is clearly enhanced in homozygous scar k13811 siz C1 - 028 double mutant embryos ( Fig . 5Bf , arrowheads ) . Taken together , these data suggest that only abi counteracts schizo , but not scar / wave . In Drosophila about 60 % of the genome is maternally contributed as mRNA to ensure embryonic development ( De Renzis et al . , 2007 ; Lecuyer et al . , 2007 ) . The mRNA of abi and scar are maternally transcribed ( Zallen et al . , 2002 ; Lin et al . , 2009 ) . We found that the schizo mRNA is still detectable in the schizo deficiency Df ( 3L ) ME178 at embryonic stage 11 when myoblasts start to fuse and at stage 14 ( Appendix Fig . 6 ) . This suggests that during embryogenesis reduced protein levels of Abi are required to antagonize Schizo function , but not Scar / WAVE . To support this notion , we overexpressed Schizo in photoreceptor cells in adult flies that have no maternal mRNA using the eye - specific GMR - GAL4 driver line . Expression of UAS - siz leads to a rough - eye phenotype ( Fig . 5Cb ) . This rough - eye phenotype is suppressed in flies heterozygous for the abi  20 mutation ( Fig . 5Cc ) . Consistently with our previous results , the rough - eye phenotype is not suppressed in flies heterozygous for the hypomorphic scar allele scar k13811 ( Fig . 5Cd ) . In addition , we observed no suppression of the rough - eye phenotype in flies heterozygous for the rac null allele rac1 J11 , which is another member of the Scar / WAVE complex ( Appendix Fig . 7B ) . Moreover , we examined whether the Abi interacting partner WASp is able to antagonize Schizo function . However , we found that the reduction of the wasp dosage using the dominant - negative EMS allele wasp 3D3 - 035 enhances the GMR - GAL4 > > UAS - siz induced rough - eye phenotype ( Appendix Fig . 7C ) . In summary , these experiments confirm our hypothesis that only reduced levels of Abi antagonize Schizo function . Discussion Understanding the multiple regulatory layers of GEF activation that allows coordinating the GDP / GTP exchange on small GTPases is an important issue . To date , the multitude of molecular interactions leading to GEF activation are most advanced for the Ras activator Son of Sevenless ( Bandaru et al . , 2019 ) . Studies on the subfamily of Arf GEFs that carry a PH domain associated with a catalytic Sec7 domain have concentrated on the interaction of the GEF with Arf GTPases and phospholipids . Membrane recruitment of Arf GTPases is mediated by a myristoylated N - terminal amphipathic helix ( Franco et al . , 1995 , Goldberg , 1998 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ) and is crucial for the activation by the GEF ( Pasqualato et al . , 2001 ; Randazzo et al . , 1995 ) . The PH domain binds phophatidyl inositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PIP 3 ) 11 and phosphatidyl insositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( Chardin et al . , 1996 ; Kavran et al . , 1998 ; Karlund et al . , 2000 ) . In structural studies with myr Arf / BRAG2 bound to a PIP 2 - containing bilayer , the myristoylated N - terminal helix of Arf is close to the Sec7 domain and it has been proposed that the Sec7 domain might recognize conformational information from the amphipathic helix ( Karandur et al . , 2017 ) . However , so far the influence of receptor binding for Arf GEF activation has not been taken into account . In this study , we found that N - cadherin levels were elevated in mutants of the Arf1 GEF schizo . These findings are in line with studies on mammalian GEP 100 / BRAG2 . The siRNA - mediated depletion of GEP 100 / BRAG2 in HepG2 cells resulted in increased E - cadherin content ( Hiroi et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , increased amounts of  1 - integrin were observed in the “knock - down” of BRAG2 in HeLa cells and it was proposed that BRAG2 served specifically for  1 - integrin internalization ( Dunphy et al . , 2006 ) . The finding that the member of the BRAG2 subfamily Schizo interacts with N - cadherin via its N - terminal region let us investigate the importance of this region for Schizo function . Our data imply that the N - terminal region provides additional layers of GEF regulation . First , we identified that Schizo undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling in the absence of the N - terminal region . Mammalian BRAG2a and BRAG2b were detected in the nuclei in HeLa and MDCK cells when overexpressed . Moreover , after treatment with leptomycin B , which inhibits the Crm1 / exportin1 nuclear - export machinery , both proteins were exclusively found in the nucleus ( Dunphy et al . , 2006 ) . BRAG2 possesses like Schizo a nuclear localization sequence in the Sec7 domain . However , whether the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Schizo is part of a regulatory pathway needs to be further investigated . Second , we found that Abi binds to the N - terminal region of Schizo . Abi has been reported to regulate actin polymerization by formation of complexes with Scar / WAVE and WASp ( Innocenti et al , 2005 ) . Furthermore , it has been described to modulate EGFR endocytosis ( Tanos and Pendergast , 2007 ) . Besides , Abi - 1 has been identified to interact with the Ras activator Son of Sevenless ( Scita et al . , 1999 ; Fan and Goff , 2000 ) . Vesicle scission in Clathrin - independent endocytosis depends on specialized actin - based platforms ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Mayor et al . , 2014 ) . However , there is no unifying theme and multiple mechanisms may co - exist . The molecular machinery of CLIC / GEEC - dependent endocytosis involves the activation of Arf1 by the Arf GEF GBF1 and the RhoGAP protein Graf that removes Cdc42 from the plasma membrane ( Kumari and Mayor , 2008 ; Gupta et al . , 2009 ) . A recent study has addressed the spatio - temporal localization of known molecules affecting CLIC / GEEC endocytosis by using by using real - 12 time TIRF microscopy ( Sathe et al . , 2018 ) . In this study it was reported that Arp3 recruitment occurred earlier to endocytic vesicles than Cdc42 . Furthermore , N - WASp failed to recruit to form CLIC / GEEC endocytotic sites . These data imply alternative pathways for Arp2 / 3 activation in CLIC / GEEC endocytosis . In Drosophila , WASp lacking the Cdc42 - binding domain ( Wasp  CRIB ) is still able to rescue the adult phenotype of wasp mutants and it was proposed that other elements than Cdc42 contribute to Drosophila WASp activation ( Tal et al . , 2002 ) . Such an alternative element might be Abi . However , our genetic interaction studies suggested that Abi counteracts Schizo function . Dissecting the function of Arp2 / 3 - dependent endocytosis during myoblast fusion is challenging since the fusion of myoblasts depends on Scar / WAVE - and WASp - dependent Arp2 / 3 activation ( Kim et al . , 2007 ; Massarwa et al . , 2007 ; Richardson et al . , 2007 ; Schäfer et al . , 2007 ; Berger et al . , 2008 ) . This might explain why the myoblast fusion phenotype in abi siz double mutants is not suppressed although amounts of N - cadherins are reduced . Therefore , we overexpressed Schizo in photoreceptor cells and performed gene dose experiments and found that only the reduction of the abi suppressed the Schizo - induced overexpression phenotype . In Salmonella host cell invasion , the Arf6 GTPase was shown to affect indirectly actin polymerization by activating the GEF ARNO ( Humphreys et al . , 2013 ) . Arf6 is activated by EFA6 or BRAG and recruits the autoinhibited GEF ARNO to the plasma membrane . The autoinhibition of ARNO is released by the binding of activated Arf6 to its PH domain . As a consequence , ARNO activates Arf1 , which induces together with Rac1 the activation of the WAVE Regulatory Complex ( Koronakis et al . , 2011 ; Humphreys et al . , 2013 ) . Since we found no evidence that scar / wave or wasp exert a regulatory influence on Schizo , we propose that Abi might be part of a dosage - dependent regulatory feedback mechanism following Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization . The data presented in this study point towards a novel model for the regulation of the Arf1 GEF Schizo ( Fig . 6 ) . First , we suggest that amounts of N - cadherin are regulated by the Sec7 GEF Schizo and that the N - terminal region of Schizo is crucial for the regulation of its activity ( Fig . 6A ) . The Abl - interacting partner Abi might compete with N - cadherin for Schizo binding and disturbs the removal of N - cadherin . However , since the expression of the constitutive - active form of UAS - Sec7 - PH decreases amounts of N - cadherin in the absence of the N - terminal region , we propose that Abi acts rather as an allosteric modulator by either inhibiting the binding of myristyolated Arf1 ( Fig . 6B ) or by inhibiting the binding of the Sec7 - PH module to the lipid bilayer ( Fig . 6C ) . A second regulatory mechanism to control 13 Schizo activity might involve the nuclear localization sequence within the GEF domain in the absence of the N - terminal region . The data reported in our study will now be valuable for future structural analyses to determine how Abi prevents GEF activity .

Material and Methods Drosophila stocks and genetics Generation of pUASt - attB - eGFP - siz 1 - 1313 , pUASt - attB - eGFP - siz 753 - 1313 flies and siz - Sec - PH : The siz 1 - 1313 and siz 753 - 1313 construct were amplified from the LP01489 cDNA by PCR , subcloned into the pENTRTM / D - TOPO® vector and recombined into the Gateway vector pUASt - attB - rfa - eGFP . We used the following primer pairs : siz 753 - 1313 _ f : 5’ - CACCATGGAGACGATACGCAAG - 3’ siz 753 - 1313 _ rev : 5’ - TTAGACCTCCGTCGACCGT - 3’ siz Sec7 - PH _ f : 5’ - CACCATGTCGGAGAC - 3’ siz Sec7 - PH _ rev : 5’ - GAGATGGAGTCGTGA - 3’ graf mutant flies y 1 cho 2 v 1 ; graf mutants were generated using a single target construct in the CRISPR / Cas9 system as described by Kondo and Ueda ( 2013 ) . For cloning of the target construct , primers 5’ - CTTCGGTCAAAGATCTTATGAGTG - 3’ and 5’ - 14 AAACCACTCATAAGATCTTTGACC - 3’ were used , and the product was ligated to pBFv - U6 . 2 . The target construct was injected into y 2 cho 2 v 1 P { nos - phiC31 \ int . NLS } X ; attP2 ( III ) , and established transgenic flies were crossed with y 2 cho 2 v 1 ; attP40 { nos - Cas9 } / CyO flies for mutagenesis . Twenty - three founder flies were crossed with y 2 cho 2 v 1 ; Sco / CyO flies to establish potential mutants . Genomic regions next to the target sequence of homozygous offspring were analyzed by PCR and screened for deletions . Generation of pUASt - graf -  BAR and pUASt -  BAR  SH3 The graf -  BAR and pUASt -  BAR  SH3 constructs were amplified from the full - length graf LD28528 cDNA obtained from DGRC . It should be noted that the cDNA clone reported as fully sequenced contains in flybase contains an additional nucleotide at position 467 , which leads to a shift of the open reading frame . As a consequence , the deduced protein from this cDNA lacks the BAR domain . To generate full - length Graf , we performed a site - specific mutagenesis on the LD28528 cDNA to remove the additional nucleotide . Other stocks The hypomorphic schizo EMS allele siz C1 - 028 was generated by Hummel et al . ( 1999 ) and the CNS and muscle phenotype of siz C1 - 028 was characterized and described in Önel et al . ( 2004 ) and Dottermusch - Heidel et al . ( 2012 ) . UAS - Arf1T31N - eGFP was generated and described in Dottermusch - Heidel et al . ( 2012 ) . abi  20 mutants were kindly provided by Sven Bogdan ( Stephan et al . , 2011 ) . The twist - GAL4 driver line SG24 was obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center . As abi deficiency we used the deficiency line Df ( 3R ) BSC617 ( BL25692 ) from the Bloomington Stock Center . Further GAL4 driver lines that were used in this study are Mef - GAL4 ( Ranganayakulu et al . , 1996 ) and TGX twist - GAL4 ( from A . Michelson ) .

Yeast two - hybrid assay Yeast two - hybrid experiments were carried out using the Matchmaker GAL4 Two - Hybrid System 3 ( Takara Clontech ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For construct generation , the schizo cDNA LP01489 from DGRC was used . The following primers were used to generated the different schizo and graf constructs : siz 1 - 323 5’ - CATATGATGTCCAGGTGTGA - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCTCGCACTCCGC - 3’ siz 1 - 758 5’ - CATATGATGTCCAGGTGTGA - 3’ and 5’ - 15 siz 324 - 753 5’ - CATATGATGGCCCGTAACG - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCTATCGTCTCCGAC - 3’ siz 754 - 993 5’ - CATATGATGCGCAAGCGAC - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCCACACCAGGTCG - 3’ siz 994 - 1313 5’ - CATATGATGCATCAGCGCG - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCTTAGACCTCCGTC - 3’ siz 324 - 993 5’ - GAATTCATGGCCCGTAACGCA - 3’ and 5’ - CTCGAGCACACCAGGTCG - 3’ graf 5’ - CATATGATGGGCGGCGGCAAAAAT - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCTAATGGT GCGGCTTCAAAT - 3’ graf  BAR 5’ - CATATGATGTCAACTAAAAAGCCCGAA - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCCTAATGGTGCGGCTTCAAAT - 3’ graf  BAR  PH 5’ - CATATGCTGGCTCCCGGCA - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCCTAATGGTGCGGCTTCAAAT - 3’ graf  BAR  SH3 5’ - CATATGATGTCAACTAAAAAGCCCGAA - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCGGTGCCCGTTGA - 3’ graf  BAR  PH  RhoGAP 5’ - CATATGAGCGCCGATATCAA - 3’ and 5’ - GGATCCCTAATGGTGCGGCTTCAAAT - 3’ The products were cloned into the pCRII - TOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) . The bait vector pGADT7 was digested with Nde I and BamH I . siz was cloned with EcoRI and XhoI into the pGADT7 . siz was cloned with NdeI and EcoRI into the pGADT7 . The pGADT7 - T and pBGKT7 - p53 pair was used as a positive control . The candidate interaction pairs were co - transformed into yeast strain AH109 , and the transformed yeast cells were selected using synthetic dropout ( SD / - Leu / - Trp ) medium , and then further selected on SD / - Leu / - Trp - His / - Ade selective medium with X -  - Gal ( 80 mg / L ) . Results were obtained after 2 days of growth at 30°C . Drosophila cell culture Drosophila S2R + cells were propagated in 1× Schneider’s Drosophila medium ( Invitrogen ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum at 25°C , and transiently transfected described by Kaipa et al . ( 2013 ) by using the FuGENE® HD Transfection Reagent ( Promega ) . Immunofluorescence Embryos were fixed and immunohistochemically analyzed as described by Schäfer et al . ( 2007 ) . The following antibodies were used at the noted dilutions : rat anti - CadN - Ex # 8 ( Iwai et al . , 1997 ) 1 : 50 ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) , guinea pig anti -  3Tubulin ( Buttgereit et al . , 1996 ; Leiss et al . , 1988 ) 1 : 10 , 000 , rabbit anti -  - Gal 1 : 5000 ( Biotrend ) , rabbit anti - GFP 1 : 500 ( abcam ) . Primary antibodies were detected using the fluorescent - 16 labeled antibodies Alexa - Fluor - 488 , 568 - or 647 - conjugated anti - guinea pig , anti - rabbit and anti - rat IgG at a dilution of 1 : 500 ( Invitrogen ) . DNA was stained with Hoechst reagent ( 5 g / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich ) , and F - actin was stained with Alexa - Fluor - 647 – phalloidin ( 1 : 100 , Invitrogen ) . For all stainings , specimens were embbeded in Fluoromount - G TM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and observed under a Leica TCS Sp2 or TCS Sp8 confocal microscope . Fluorescence Intensity and Statistical Test Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software ( PRISM7 ) . For Figures 2 , 3 , 5 and EV1 significance was determined by one - way ANOVA with comparison . Microscopy and image analysis A Leica TCS Sp2 ( Fig . 1B – E’’ ) and TCS SP8 ( Fig . 1F – G’ , Fig . 2 , Fig . 3 , Fig . EV1 , Fig . 5 ) confocal microscope was used for fluorescence imaging . The same parameter settings were used to image all samples of the same type . Embryos were embedded in Fluoromount - G TM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and scanned using the 20x objective with the galvo scanner at 400 Hz . The raw data of the embryo images were analyzed using the FIJI software ( Schindelin et a . , 2012 ) . A SUM - stack was generated in Fiji and the mean fluorescence intensity of three nearby areas were also measured to analyze the background fluorescence level . The corrected total relative intensity of each embryo was calculated as follows : ( Area embryo * Mean - Intensity embryo ) – ( Area embryo * Background ) For time - lapse imaging , the Spinning disc microscope from Zeiss was used with the 63x objective . Scanning electron microscopy All GMR - GAL4 > UAS - siz - expressing flies were raised at 25°C . Eyes were fixed in 6 % glutaraldehyde and 1 % formaldehyde in 0 . 2 M Hepes buffer for 16 h . Samples were then dehydrated in a 25 % , 50 % , 70 % and 96 % ethanol series for 12 h each and finally transferred into acetone by three 10 - min changes with 100 % acetone . The samples were critical - point - dried by using a Polaron E 3000 ( Balzers Union ) . Samples were attached to sample stubs ( Plano GmbH ) and sputtered with gold under vacuum using a sputter coater ( Balzers Union , 17 Lichtenstein ) . Scanning electron micrographs of adult fly eyes were taken using a Hitachi S - 530 SEM . Author contributions SFÖ initiated , conceived and supervised the project .

In Drosophila , myoblasts are subdivided into founder cells ( FCs ) and fusion - competent myoblasts ( FCMs ) . N - cadherin and Schizo are expressed in both myoblast - types , and the N - terminal region of Schizo binds to the intracellular domain of N - cadherin . A ' . Lateral view of a stage 16 wild - type embryo stained with anti -  3 - Tubulin to visualize somatic muscles . At the end of embryogenesis , a repeated pattern of multinucleated muscles per hemisegment is visible . A’’ . Lateral view of a stage 16 embryo homozygous for the schizo C1 - 028 allele . The embryo was stained with anti -  3 - Tubulin . The multinucleated muscle pattern is disturbed in schizo mutants , since myoblasts fail to fuse . B . Schematic representation of the Drosophila ventral nerve cord . Neurons send out their axons towards the midline to form the anterior ( ac ) and posterior ( pc ) 26 commissures . To ensure that commissural axons only cross the midline once , the midline glia cells ( blue ) secrete the repellent Slit . Schizo is expressed in midline glia cells and antagonizes Slit signalling .

Yeast two hybrid tests . As indicators for interaction the growth on SD - Ade / - Leu / - His / - Trp plates and the implementation of  - Galaktosidase by the Galactosidase MEL1 were used . Plates were incubated for 48 h . - no growth and blue coluor in 48 h ; + growth and blue coluor in 48 h . In 1 to 7 Abi full - length cloned into the bait vector pBKGT7 from Clontech was tested for protein interaction with Schizo deletions cloned into the prey vector pGADT7 . Schizo full - length Siz 1 - 1313 , Siz 1 - 323 , Siz 753 - 972 , Siz 972 - 1313 and Siz 323 - 972 showed an interaction with Abi . Control experiments ( i – vi ) revealed an interaction of Siz 972 - 1313 pGADT7 with the empty pBGKT7 . In 8 the N - terminal region of Siz 1 - 753 cloned into the pBGKT7 interacted with Abi full - length cloned into the pGADT7 . In 9 to 14 only the SH3 domain of Abi into the pBGKT7 was used for interaction studies with Schizo deletions . An interaction with Siz 1 - 1313 , Siz 1 - 323 , Siz 972 - 1313 and Siz 323 - 972 was observed . Figure 5 Abi and Schizo serve antagonistic functions . 29 A .

( b ) This phenotype can be suppressed by taking out one copy of abi  20 ( GMR - GAL4 / + ; UAS - siz / abi  20 ) . ( c ) Taking out one copy of scar k13811 does not suppress the GMR - GAL4 / + > > UAS - siz / + - induced phenotype . 30 Figure 6 Contingent models indicating how the binding of Abi might antagonize Schizo function . A . The N - terminal region of Schizo interacts with the intracellular region of N - cadherin to regulate amounts of N - cadherin . The activity of Schizo involves the interaction of the Sec7 domain with the Arf1 - GTPase and the lipid interaction of the Sec7 and PH domain . The binding of Abi to the N - terminal region of Schizo counteracts N - cadherin regulation in a dosage - dependent manner . B . The binding of Abi to the N - terminal region of Schizo could prevent the binding of the myristoylated Arf - GTPase to Schizo , which inhibits the removal of N - cadherin . C . Alternatively , Abi might prevent the lipid interaction of the Sec7 and PH domain thereby antagonizing Schizo function .
