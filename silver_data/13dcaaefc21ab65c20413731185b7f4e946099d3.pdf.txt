Abstract : With the development of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) epidemic and the increase in cases , as a potential source of infection , the risk of close contact has gradually increased . However , few studies have analyzed the tracking and management of cross - regional personnel . In this study , we hope to understand the effectiveness and feasibility of existing close contact management measures in Chengdu , so as to provide a reference for further prevention and control of the epidemic . The close contact management mode and epidemiological characteristics of 40 , 425 close contacts from January 22 , 2020 , to March 1 , 2022 , in Chengdu , China , were analyzed . The relationship with index cases was mainly co - passengers ( 57 . 58 % ) and relatives ( 7 . 20 % ) , and the frequency of contact was mainly occasional contact J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof ( 70 . 39 % ) . A total of 400 ( 0 . 99 % ) close contacts were converted into cases , which were mainly found in the first and second nucleic acid tests ( 53 . 69 % ) , and the contact mode was mainly by sharing transportation ( 63 . 82 % ) . In terms of close contact management time , both the supposed ( ( 11 . 93±3 . 00 ) days vs . ( 11 . 92 ±7 . 24 ) days ) and actual ( ( 13 . 74±17 . 47 ) days vs . ( 12 . 60±4 . 35 ) days ) isolation times in Chengdu were longer than those of the outer cities ( P < 0 . 001 ) . For the local clustered epidemics in Chengdu , the relationship with indexed cases was mainly colleagues ( 12 . 70 % ) . The tracing and management of close contacts is a two - way management measure that requires cooperation among departments . Enhancing existing monitoring and response capabilities can control the spread of the epidemic to a certain extent . Key words : Close contact ; Epidemiological characteristics ; Tracing and management ; Spatial distribution ; Disease conversion 1 . Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has been spreading contrary to expectations since the first report in December 2019 , and its outbreak has posed a considerable threat to people around the world ( 1 , 2 ) . As of March 1 , 2022 , more than 436 million people have been infected , and 5 . 9 million have died . Fast access to cross - regional case and close contact information , and rapid identification and management of close contacts are of great significance to reduce the risk of infection in the population and controlling the spread of the epidemic ( 3 , 4 ) . In contrast to SARS CoV , the transmission of COVID - 19 occurs in the precursor period of mild illness and daily activities , which contributes to the transmission of infection ( 5 , 6 ) . If the potentially infected person is not controlled in a timely manner , they will go to work and travel , potentially spreading the virus to their contacts and even internationally ( 7 , 8 ) . Drawing on the experience of control measures for influenza A ( H 1 N 1 ) in 2009 ( 9 ) , since the beginning of the outbreak of COVID - 19 , the J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has tracked all close contacts of confirmed COVID - 19 cases , investigated contact history , tested nucleic acids , and tracked health status to prevent new cases and local transmission ( 10 ) . Jing ( 11 ) and Long ( 12 ) shared the prevention and control strategy of China , namely , actively discovering and identifying close contacts , and then quarantining and monitoring them , which effectively controlled the epidemic , and enabled Wuhan to be lifted after 76 days of lockdown . This has also laid the foundation for important achievements in China ' s phased epidemic prevention and control . Our previous research has shown that the main contact mode between close contacts and index cases was domesticity and transportation ( 13 ) . Although the infection risk for individuals who share public transportation with infected cases was low , the number of people on public transportation was large and it was difficult to identify all close contacts , which may cause a large number of people to be infected in this situation ( 14 , 15 ) . In addition , previous studies have shown that family members were also an important source of close contacts in the epidemiology of infectious disease ( 16 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 was more likely to spread among family members through coughing , sneezing , or direct contact with surfaces contaminated by the virus . They spend more time at home , resulting in a higher frequency and longer duration of unprotected exposure ( 15 ) , which leads to a higher risk of secondary infection through family contact ( 17 , 18 ) . For instance , several studies have analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of close contact . However , these studies lack the tracking and management of cross - regional personnel . The investigation presented here expected to reveal the epidemiological characteristics of close contacts under isolation and control in Chengdu and other places in China . At the same time , we analyzed the possible infection risk factors for close contact , and provided a reference basis for evaluating and optimizing epidemic prevention and control strategies . J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 2 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 Data source According to the Chinese National Health Commission in the Protocol on Prevention and Control of COVID - 19 ( Edition 6 ) ( 14 ) , close contact was defined as people who had not taken effective protection and had close contact with the confirmed or suspected cases ( within 1 meter ) within 2 days prior to illness onset or 2 days before sampling taken of the asymptomatic carriers . Once close contact was confirmed , his relevant information was entered into the “COVID - 19 Close Contact Information Management System of Chengdu” and maintained and managed by relevant personnel . Epidemiological data of COVID - 19 indexed cases were collected from January 22 , 2020 , to March 1 , 2022 . Close contacts who were quarantined due to COVID - 19 were selected , including close contacts of related cases in Chengdu , and those investigated and managed outside Chengdu were also included . 2 . 2 Personnel classifications Close contacts mainly included family members , relatives , friends , colleagues , classmates , medical workers , and service personnel . Relatives mainly referred to family members who lived with the case and other relatives who had close contact through meals and other forms . Co - passengers refers to people who take the same transportation ( airplane , train , car , ship , etc . ) and have closed contact ( within 1 meter ) , which includes carers and companions ( family , colleagues , friends , etc . ) on the same transportation . Medical personnel included patients in the same hospital ward , medical staff , and hospital staff who had not taken appropriate protective measures . While other personnel include friends and colleagues’ contact with work or social life , individuals who provide business or life services for the indicated cases , and other J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof occasional close contacts . 2 . 3 Close contact management Close contacts were subject to centralized isolation for medical observation . The medical observation period was 14 days after the last unprotected contact with indexed cases . Close contacts at the centralized observation point should be strictly managed in a single room . Those who were not suitable for centralized isolation due to age , diseases , and other reasons were subject to home quarantine for medical observation . During the observation period , the medical staff measured their body temperature twice a day and asked their health status , whether they had a fever , chills , dry cough , shortness of breath , dyspnea , chest tightness , conjunctival congestion , diarrhea , or abdominal pain , and completed the “Medical Observation Registration Form for Close Contacts of COVID - 19” . On the 1 st and 14 th days of isolation , the medical staff collected nasal and / or throat swab samples from close contacts for nucleic acid testing , and the frequency of testing was adjusted according to the national scheme . If the swab test was positive or any symptoms were found , close contact was sent to a designated hospital for infection evaluation and diagnosis . Individuals whose samples were negative and showed no symptoms were exempted after the quarantine period expired . 2 . 4 Observation index Close contact information of COVID - 19 confirmed or suspected cases and asymptomatic carriers was collected , which included basic information about close contacts , relationships with related cases , observation methods , contact methods , exposure time , outcome , sampling , and testing information . In addition , relevant indicators of local clustered epidemics in Chengdu were also analyzed . J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof 2 . 5 Statistical Analysis Retrospective data and relevant information were collected and recorded through the “COVID - 19 Close Contact Information Management System of Chengdu” from January 22 , 2020 , to March 1 , 2022 . Excel ( Microsoft Corp , WA , USA ) was used to conduct preliminary data sorting . The average value was used to supplement the missing data in some indicators . The epidemiological and contact characteristics of close contacts were analyzed by SPSS of version 22 . 0 software ( IBM Corp , NY , USA ) . Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD , and the differences between groups were expressed by independent sample t - test . While the categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages , the differences between groups were analyzed by the chi - square test . In addition , the odds ratio ( OR ) and its 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) were calculated . P < 0 . 05 was considered to be statistically significant . The spatial distribution of close contacts was described by ArcGIS version 10 . 5 software ( Environmental Systems Research Institute , Redlands , CA , USA ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 Close contact control strategy For close contact management , the confidential data were confirmed by epidemiological investigation of indexed cases or big - data platforms of public security and transportation . After verification , the main information was entered into the “COVID - 19 Close Contact Information Management System of Chengdu” system and pushed to relevant districts or other regions . Subsequently , the information was exchanged with the community , streets , and other departments . Meanwhile , close contacts were transferred to the isolated hotel for centralized management . In this process , coordination with other departments should be maintained , and the J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof implementation of close contact management and release of isolation by the hotel should be tracked . All relevant information was entered into the system and maintained and managed by relevant staff ( Fig . 1 ) . 3 . 2 Close contact overview Through the epidemiological investigation of indexed cases and the push of big - data information , as of March 1 , 2022 , Chengdu has received a total of 49 , 142 close contacts . Eventually , a total of 40 , 425 close contacts were included in the management through the screening of suspected cases , tracking time over 14 days , and incomplete information , of which 36 , 353 were in Chengdu and 4 , 072 were outside Chengdu ( Fig . 2 ) . 3 . 3 Analysis of COVID - 19 in Chengdu As of March 1 , 2022 , a total of 552 confirmed cases ( 67 . 20 % ) and 269 asymptomatic infection patients ( 32 . 80 % ) of COVID - 19 were detected in Chengdu . The epidemic situation presented three peaks ( Fig . 3 A ) . After April 2020 , the cases were mainly imported from abroad ( 79 . 54 % ) , and close contacts showed the same trend . Close contacts were mainly from confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers , accounting for 39 . 20 % and 39 . 54 % , respectively ( Fig . 3 B ) . Distribution of close contacts outside Chengdu showed dispersion from the center to the north and south ( Fig . 3 C , D ) , while close contacts inside Chengdu showed a diffusion from the center to the surroundings ( Fig . 3 E ) . 3 . 4 Basic characteristics of close contact Among the 40 , 425 close contacts , 68 . 40 % were male , with an average age of ( 34 . 26±12 . 96 ) years , mainly in the 15 - 30 - year - old age group ( 40 . 51 % ) . No significant difference was found in the age groups between Chengdu and outside the city . The J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof relationship between close contact and indexed cases was mainly co - passengers ( 57 . 58 % ) and relatives ( 7 . 20 % ) , and the frequency of contact was mainly occasional ( 70 . 39 % ) . A total of 37 , 237 ( 92 . 61 % ) close contacts were brought into centralized quarantine , and 40 , 025 ( 99 . 01 % ) close contacts were released from quarantine . During the centralized isolation period , a total of 400 ( 0 . 99 % ) closed contacts were transferred to confirmed cases or asymptomatic carriers ( Table 1 ) . 3 . 5 Close contacts converted to cases A total of 400 cases were found among the close contacts , including 214 confirmed cases . The average age of the patients was 34 . 34 years ( IQR : 25 . 00 - 41 . 00 ) ; 72 . 75 % ( 291 / 400 ) were male . The average detection time of cases was 7 . 50 days , mainly in the first and second nucleic acid tests ( 53 . 69 % ) ( Fig . 4 A ) . A total of 96 . 73 % of the cases were related to contact with confirmed cases or asymptomatic infected persons ( Fig . 4 C ) . The frequency of contact was mainly occasional contact ( 53 . 77 % ) , which was mainly through shared transportation ( 63 . 82 % ) ( Fig . 4 D , E ) . There was no significant difference in the incidence of close contacts between overseas imported patients ( 1 . 06 % ) and local cases ( 0 . 82 % ) ( Fig . 4 F ) . 3 . 6 Time index comparison Compared with close contacts outside Chengdu , the discovery time of close contacts in Chengdu was shorter ( ( 2 . 11±3 . 10 ) days vs . ( 2 . 62±7 . 87 ) days ) ( Fig . 5 A ) . While the supposed quarantine time ( ( 11 . 93±3 . 00 ) days vs . ( 11 . 92 ±7 . 24 ) days ) and the actual isolation time ( ( 13 . 74±17 . 47 ) days vs . ( 12 . 60±4 . 35 ) days ) were longer , and the difference was statistically significant ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 5 B , C ) . 3 . 7 Local epidemic analysis After the epidemic became normalized , a total of four local clustered epidemics J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof occurred in Chengdu . Of these , 84 cases were found , and 9 , 239 close contacts were determined . The average age of close contact was ( 33 . 67±12 . 96 ) years old , the relationship with the case was mainly colleagues ( 12 . 70 % ) , and the frequency of contact was mainly occasional contact ( 74 . 20 % ) . A total of 45 close contacts were converted into cases . In the four rounds of epidemics , there were no statistically significant differences in the relationship with cases , contact frequency , or isolation method , and control time ( P < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 2 ) . 4 . Discussion Since the COVID - 19 pandemic , Chengdu has carried out case investigation and disposal , close contact tracking , developed a close contact management system , and carried out the management mode of self - management and co - investigation for close contacts . To facilitate the isolation and control of close contact and understand their status , Chengdu CDC began to develop and maintain the “COVID - 19 Close Contact Information Management System of Chengdu” since the beginning of the epidemic . To the best of my knowledge , this is the first city in China to establish a close contact management system , at least at the municipal level . At present , the efficient management and rapid information acquisition of the system have been recognized by Chengdu municipal government departments . Moreover , it is planned to integrate the system with the overall epidemic prevention and control platform in Chengdu and strive to promote it throughout the city . Through the circulation of indexed cases , as of March 1 , 2022 , Chengdu tracked and managed 40 , 425 close contacts . Among these , 36 , 353 were in Chengdu , while other cities and provinces assisted in the management of 1 , 653 and 2 , 419 , respectively ( Fig . 2 ) . Actually , it is a two - way management measure of close contact tracking and management . First , it helps to understand the transition states of close contact . Once a close contact was converted to a case , this may facilitate the rapid management and control of him , especially for close contact transferred to other places . Second , it is J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof helpful to improve the feedback efficiency of the state information of close contact , and provide a reference for close contact release in time . In this study , 400 cases were found in a timely and accurate manner through the implementation of centralized medical management of close contacts , which reduced the possibility of second - generation cases , and fully demonstrated that the current management model in Chengdu is effective and feasible . Since it took a certain time to judge and analyze the close contact , and the information exchange with other regions was different from conventional communication , there was a certain time difference in time feedback , which inevitably led to the discovery time of close contact being different in Chengdu and other regions ( ( 2 . 11±3 . 10 ) days vs . ( 2 . 62±7 . 87 ) days ) ( Fig . 5 ) . Based on the WHO and China ' s prevention and control management measures , Chengdu strictly controlled the community management time before April 2021 . Compared with some domestic regions ( 19 , 20 ) , the control time of close contact in Chengdu was extended by 7 - 14 days , which increased the possibility of finding potential cases during the isolation observation period . At the same time , according to the epidemic situation , China has continuously adjusted the prevention and control plan and increased the frequency of nucleic acid detection . Through this step , we more effectively found the possible cases and prevented the generation of second - generation cases . In this study , the secondary generation rate of close contact was 0 . 99 % , which was lower than that in relevant studies ( 10 , 19 ) . In contrast to some studies ( 15 , 21 ) , we found that 83 . 28 % of the second - generation cases were co - passengers with indexed cases , which might be due to the different judgment methods of close contact . Our data showed that 57 . 58 % of close contacts had shared transportation experience with indexed cases , and 88 . 81 % were passengers on the same flight ( Table 1 ) . Since April 2020 , COVID - 19 cases in Chengdu have mainly been imported from abroad . Different from local close contacts , these people have a relatively single track of activity and enter strict centralized isolation management after preliminary nucleic J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof acid detection ( 22 ) . Moreover , with the assistance of airlines and public security , these people were easier to control . Therefore , the case discovery time was lower than that of local cases ( ( 0 . 64±1 . 21 ) days vs . ( 4 . 22±4 . 88 ) days ) . Among the 400 second - generation cases , 63 . 75 % ( 255 / 400 ) cases were on the same flight ( Fig . 4E ) and these may have been infected before departure . It is worth noting that in most family environments , especially when COVID - 19 indicated cases in the incubation period , it is difficult to achieve physical alienation and avoid direct oral communication ( 22 ) . Compared with published studies in other countries , once a confirmed case was found , the local CDC immediately isolated family contacts at designated locations , which may reduce the secondary incidence of family contacts ( 23 ) . In our study , family contacts accounted for 7 . 20 % , and the secondary generation rate was 2 . 59 % , which was lower than that in other cities in China ( 11 . 2 % ) ( 10 ) and the United States ( 10 . 5 % ) ( 24 ) . Due to the contact frequency between family members , reduction or neglect of personal protective equipment use , shared living and eating environment , and the continued existence of SARS - CoV - 2 on different surfaces , it provides favorable conditions for the mutual spread of family members ( 25 , 26 ) . Therefore , in terms of management , centralized isolation should be adopted as much as possible to avoid further transmission among family members ( 10 ) . After the normalization of the epidemic situation in China , four large - scale local cluster epidemics occurred in Chengdu , and a total of 9 , 239 close contacts were determined to be , of which 45 ( 0 . 49 % ) turned into cases . Given the increased transmission speed and risk of Delta virus strain , the concept of “four identical” was introduced for the judgment of close contact , that is , in the same space , same unit , same building , and with the patient four days before onset of disease was judged as close contact . Thus the range of close contacts has expanded , which may have a certain impact on the second - generation rate . Due to the unknown source of the epidemic and concealment of transmission in the early stage , these close contacts J ou r na l P r e - p r oo f Journal Pre - proof were different from an imported population from abroad . In addition , the relationship with the case was more diverse , which was mainly accompanied by colleagues ( 12 . 70 % ) and the interchange of time and space ( 9 . 52 % ) . This investigation had several limitations . As mentioned in our previous research , it is mainly reflected in information offset ( 13 ) . The reason lies in objective forgetting , subjective deliberate concealment , and incomplete information recall . At the same time , due to the presence of close contacts for more than 14 days , which suggested the co - investigation mechanism needs to be improved to further avoid the possibility of infection risk . In addition , we could not rule out the possibility that infected close contacts have another unknown source of infection before isolation , which may affect our conclusion to a certain extent . Furthermore , due to the lack of relevant data on vaccination before October 2020 , considering the completeness of data , we did not include this part of data in the analysis . Finally , with the change in the prevention and control period , the determination and control methods of close contacts also changed , but the overall difference was small . In summary , our present study indicates that fellow passengers and relatives were still the main sources of close contact in Chengdu . Follow - up research needs to strengthen the study on the close contact characteristics of different COVID - 19 virus types , such as Delta and Omicron strains . For the government , it is necessary to continue to adhere to and optimize various scientific measures to establish risk level assessment standards for the management of close contacts .
