High - speed atomic force microscopy shows dynamic molecular processes in photoactivated bacteriorhodopsin Mikihiro Shibata 1 , Hayato Yamashita 1 , Takayuki Uchihashi 1 , 2 , Hideki Kandori 3 and Toshio Ando 1 , 2 * Dynamic changes in protein conformation in response to external stimuli are important in biological processes , but it has proved difﬁcult to directly visualize such structural changes under physiological conditions 1 – 10 . Here , we show that high - speed atomic force microscopy 7 can be used to visu - alize dynamic changes in stimulated proteins . High - resolution movies of a light - driven proton pump , bacteriorhodopsin 11 , 12 , reveal that , upon illumination , a cytoplasmic portion of each bacteriorhodopsin monomer is brought into contact with adja - cent trimers . The bacteriorhodopsin – bacteriorhodopsin inter - action in the transiently formed assembly engenders both positive and negative cooperative effects in the decay kinetics as the initial bacteriorhodopsin recovers and , as a consequence , the turnover rate of the photocycle is maintained constant , on average , irrespective of the light intensity . These results conﬁrm that high - resolution visualization is a powerful approach for studying elaborate biomolecular processes under realistic conditions . The biological function of a protein is closely associated with its ability to undergo structural changes . In many cases , these structural changes are triggered by external stimuli such as pH , temperature , ligand binding , mechanical stress and light . Although direct real - space and real - time visualization of such changes is a straightfor - ward approach to understanding the dynamic molecular processes involved , the lack of suitable techniques has been a barrier . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) is a versatile technique with which to image proteins in liquids at submolecular resolution , but its poor temporal resolution has meant that only static or slow time - lapse images of proteins have been obtained 1 – 5 . In the last decade , various efforts have been made to increase the scan speed of AFM 6 – 9 . As a result , single protein molecules showing Brownian motion have been captured on video with a temporal res - olution of (cid:2) 30 ms ( the highest achieved to date ; ref . 10 ) . However , dynamic visualization of physiologically relevant conformational changes in proteins has been difﬁcult because the tip – sample inter - action tends to interfere with the physiological functions . To solve this problem , a new method has recently been developed that allows fast and precise control of the tip – sample distance with a minimum load to the sample 7 . Using such methods , we report here the ﬁrst example of dynamic imaging of a functioning biological sample . Bacteriorhodopsin ( bR ) represents a well - known case of the association between stimulus - triggered structural dynamics and biological function 11 , 12 , and its direct visualization has long been a goal . Bacteriorhodopsin contains seven transmembrane a - helices ( termed A – G ) enclosing the chromophore retinal 13 , 14 . In the photo - cycle , a series of spectral intermediates , designated J , K , L , M , N and O , occur in that order 12 . The light - induced conformational changes in bR have been investigated by various methods 15 – 25 , leading to a consensus that the proton channel at the cytoplasmic surface is opened by the tilting of helix F away from the protein centre 21 , 23 , 24 . Sass et al . reported helix F displacement of (cid:2) 0 . 1 nm in the late M state , based on X - ray diffraction of the three - dimen - sional crystal of wild type ( WT ) 21 . However , a larger structural change in bR was reported in the electron crystallography study of the D96G , F171C , F219 L triple mutant of bR : displacement of helix F by (cid:2) 0 . 35 nm , away from the centre of the protein 23 . An elec - tron crystallography study of the F219 L mutant further reported that helices E and F tilt away from the centre of the protein , followed by a shift of the E – F loop by (cid:2) 0 . 3 nm ( ref . 24 ) , resulting in large - scale conformational changes in the M and N states 18 , 19 , 25 . Nevertheless , a consensus on the conformational changes has not yet been reached . As for other proteins , knowledge of the structural dynamics of bR is limited because its structural data have been accu - mulated using static and ensemble averaging approaches . Direct and dynamic visualization using high - speed AFM should provide a better overview of the conformational changes of bR . We used the D96N bR mutant , which has a longer photocycle ( (cid:2) 10 s ) than the WT ( (cid:2) 10 ms ) , but retains its proton pumping ability 26 . Figure 1a presents successive images of D96N at the cyto - plasmic surface , captured at 1 frame per second ( fps ; Supplementary Movie S1 ) . Individual bR molecules can be seen clearly , as reported in earlier pioneering studies for the unphotolysed state 3 – 5 . Upon illumination with green light , bR drastically changes its structure ( compare images at 1 and 2 s ) and returns to the unphotolysed state in a few seconds after light - off , an outcome that is reproducible in repeated dark – illumination cycles ( Supplementary Movie S1 ) . We analysed the ‘mass centre’ positions of the individual mono - mers imaged during the dark – illumination cycles . Note that the ‘mass centre’ for each bR monomer was calculated from the corresponding surface area and height distribution in the image ( see Methods ) . All the activated bR monomers exhibited displace - ments of their centre of mass , with an average displacement of 0 . 69 + 0 . 15 nm ( Supplementary Fig . S1 , in the green region ) . In Fig . 1b , the trajectories of the mass centre positions during the dark – illumination cycles are superimposed on the AFM image in the unphotolysed state ( red , blue and black marks ) . They show highly centrosymmetric trajectories , oriented outward from the trimer centres . The top and bottom images in Fig . 1c show magniﬁed images obtained before and during illumination , respectively . The promi - nent protrusion in the AFM topographs reﬂects interhelical loop structures on the cytoplasmic surface 4 , 27 . Compared with the atomic model of the a - helical cytoplasmic ends in the unphotolysed 1 Department of Physics , Kanazawa University , Kanazawa 920 - 1192 , Japan , 2 CREST / JST , Tokyo 102 - 0075 , Japan , 3 Department of Frontier Materials , Nagoya Institute of Technology , Nagoya 466 - 8555 , Japan . * e - mail : tando @ kenroku . kanazawa - u . ac . jp LETTERS PUBLISHED ONLINE : 14 FEBRUARY 2010 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / NNANO . 2010 . 7 NATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY | VOL 5 | MARCH 2010 | www . nature . com / naturenanotechnology 208 © 20 1 0 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Therefore , the protrusion movement visualized here is ascribed to the displacement of the E – F loop . As a result of E – F loop displace - ment , the protrusion is divided into two sections ( green arrows 1 and 2 in Fig . 1c ) , and the minor protrusion ( green arrow 2 ) likely corresponds to the position around helices A and B . Note that the overall position of each bR molecule does not change because of indiscernible alterations at the extracellular surface ( Supplementary Fig . S2 and Movie S5 ) . To ensure that the conformational changes observed here are not artifacts such as tip - force - induced structural alterations 4 , we measured the decay of the active state after ﬂash illumination at various pH values ( Fig . 1d ) . UV - visible spectroscopy 26 has shown that the lifetime of the M - intermediate of D96N and WT is pro - longed at alkaline pH . In agreement with this fact ( inset , Fig . 1d ) is the observation here with D96N that the decay detected by high - speed AFM showed a strong pH dependence ( Fig . 1d ) . Using WT at pH 7 and pH 10 , this ﬁnding was further conﬁrmed ( Fig . 2 , Supplementary Movies S2 , S3 ) . Because of the very fast photocycle , no conformational changes were detected in WT at pH 7 , whereas at pH 10 , conformational changes similar to those of D96N were observed , although the activated state decays much faster than that of D96N . The activation of D96N was observed within 1 s immediately after illumination , but was not observed after light - off , even at alka - line pH ( data not shown ) . A cysteine accessibility study with D96N indicated displacement of the E – F loop in the M state 19 . Therefore , the high - speed AFM imaging of D96N did capture the light - induced ground - to - M - state transition . Because the AFM obser - vation was performed with the samples on a mica surface , we cannot exclude a possible effect of the surface .

All rights reserved . AFM may contain an additional state in which the Schiff base is reprotonated ( during M decay ) but the protein conformation has not yet returned to the ground state . As a result of the outward displacement of the E – F loop , nearest - neighbour bR monomers , each belonging to a different adjacent trimer , transiently assemble . Here , we use a new designation , ‘trefoil’ , for the triad of nearest - neighbour monomers to distinguish it from the original trimer . Notably , this transient assembly in a trefoil alters the decay kinetics of the activated state ( Supplementary Movie S4 ) . Figure 3a shows the time course of the displacement of the mass centres for six bR monomers belong - ing to two different trefoils observed at different light intensities ( Mn1 – Mn3 ; n indicates different trefoils ) ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Under weak illumination , it is mainly the case that only one monomer in each trefoil is activated ( M 1 3 and M 2 2 in the left panel of Fig . 3a ) . When only one monomer is activated in a trefoil , it decays with a time constant of 7 . 3 + 0 . 58 s ( the top panel of Fig . 3b ) . In contrast , under stronger illumination , two or three monomers within a trefoil tend to be activated together . Interestingly , the decay of each monomer markedly depends on the order of its activation . The monomer that is activated latest among the activated monomers in the trefoil ( blue arrows in the right panel of Fig . 3a ) decays with a shorter time constant of 2 . 0 + 0 . 16 s ( the middle panel of Fig . 3b ) . On the other hand , the decay kinetics of the early activated monomers ( M 1 2 and M 2 2 in the right panel of Fig . 3a ) does not follow a single exponential ( the bottom panel of Fig . 3b ) , and the averaged decay time lengthens a b D i s t a n c e f r o m i n i t i a l p o s i t i on ( n m ) D i s t a n c e f r o m i n i t i a l p o s i t i on ( n m ) 150 120 90 60 30 0 Time ( s ) 150 120 90 60 30 0 Time ( s ) M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 M10 M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 M10 1 . 5 nm Figure 2 | Displacement of mass centre positions for WTat the cytoplasmic surface . a , b , Ten typical bR monomers at pH 7 ( a ) and pH 10 ( b ) are analysed .

On the other hand , when one or two nearest - neighbour molecules ( as depicted by green circles in the middle ﬁgure ) in a trefoil are already activated , the bR monomer activated latest ( as depicted by the blue circles in the middle ﬁgure ) decays faster . The exponential time constant ( t ) is shortened to 2 . 0 + 0 . 16 s ( n T ¼ 228 , n m ¼ 55 ) .

This observation indicates that the early activated monomers do not return to the ground state as long as the adjacent monomers within the trefoil are in the active state . In addition , Fig . 4 shows decay of the activated D96N under weak or strong light intensities . Note that all the activated molecules were counted regardless of their activation order and of the number of activated monomers in a trefoil . The distributions of the activated state lifetime are well ﬁt to single exponential functions under both weak and strong light illumination , and their decay constants are almost identical , despite the different light intensities . This can be explained by the coexistence of the positive and negative coopera - tivity effects elicited by bR – bR interactions within a trefoil ( Fig . 3b ) . Because of the coexistence and the bipolar nature , the two coopera - tive effects cancel out one another on averaging , resulting in a con - stant decay rate independent of light intensity . Under a conceivable assumption that the conformational change turnover of an activated bR monomer is tightly coupled with proton transfer by the bR monomer , the average rate of proton pumping by the activated bR would be conserved independently of light intensity . As a result of the cancellation effect , the cooperative effects can never be detected by ensemble averaging approaches . Thus , the cooperative effects are different from those proposed from absorption spectroscopic studies in which fast and slow decays of the M - state were detected that depend on light intensity , while the total turnover rate was inde - pendent of light intensity 28 , 29 . This previous report is consistent with our presumption that the activated state detected by high - speed AFM contains both the M - state and subsequent states . Importantly , the cooperative effects we found are caused by bR – bR interactions within a trefoil , not within a trimer . As demonstrated above , direct and real - space visualization of the dynamically changing structure of stimulated proteins provides a straightforward way of elucidating how protein molecules function . We can expect that a large number of dynamic biomolecular processes will be directly visualized in the near future , leading to new ﬁndings inaccessible using other approaches . With further advances in high - speed AFM techniques , even molecular processes on membranes of live cells will be directly visualized . The present study is the ﬁrst step towards achieving these expected innovations in biological research . Methods Sample preparation . Purple membranes containing either WT or D96N mutant were isolated from Halobacterium salinarum as described previously 30 . The samples were suspended in a solution containing 10 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 , 8 , 9 or 10 ) and 300 mM KCl . High - speed AFM observation . The laboratory - built high - speed AFM apparatus is an extensively improved version of the previously reported one 6 . See a comprehensive review 7 of instrument development , including recent technical advances . AFM images were acquired in the tapping mode . To detect cantilever deﬂection , we used an optical beam deﬂection detector equipped with an infrared laser ( 980 nm ) . The laser beam was focused onto a small cantilever using a (cid:3) 50 objective lens . The cantilever ( Olympus ) was 6 – 7 m m long , 2 m m wide and 90 nm thick , with a spring constant of 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 N m 2 1 . Its resonant frequency and quality factor in aqueous solution were (cid:2) 1 MHz and (cid:2) 2 , respectively . In the AFM imaging , the free oscillation amplitude was (cid:2) 1 nm and the set - point amplitude was 90 % of the free amplitude . The tapping force estimated was less than 30 pN . An amorphous carbon tip was grown on the original tip byelectron - beam deposition . The tip length was adjusted to (cid:2) 1 m m , and the tip apex was sharpened by plasma etching under argon gas ( (cid:2) 4 nm in radius ) . AFM observations were performed under solution at room temperature . For illumination of the bR sample , a green laser ( 532 nm ) was irradiated through the (cid:3) 50 objective lens . The intensity measured at the exit of the objective lens was varied in the range 0 . 004 – 0 . 5 m W . Data analysis of mass centre position . The mass centre positions of imaged bR monomers were calculated by the following procedures . First , a whole AFM image was segmented into each monomer region by a watershed algorithm . Second , the greyscale of each segment was digitized using a threshold determined by a fuzzy - entropy algorithm . The pixels with greyscales above threshold were deﬁned as those of a monomer ( region of interest ; ROI ) . Finally , the centre of mass of a monomer was calculated for the ROI using the pixel positions and the greyscales . Note that the centre of mass analysed here is not the real centre of mass of the protein , but that of the AFM image of the monomer .
