VOL . 16 NO . 2 June 2019 98 INTRODUCTION Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) is a common eczematous skin disorder , the prevalence or incidence of which in the first 5 years of childhood is 10 % to 16 . 5 % . It is generally considered to have increased worldwide , at least from the 1980s to early 2000s ( 1 ) . Clinical features of AD include skin inflammation , barrier disruption and chronic pruritus ( Figure 1 ) ( 2 ) . Abnormal microbial colonization , such as Staphylococcus aureus , is also associated with barrier dysfunction ( 3 ) . The co - occurrence of autoimmune diseases is slightly increased in patients with AD ( 4 ) . Since the discovery of type 2 helper T ( Th2 ) cells by Mosmann et al . ( 5 ) , type 2 cytokines such as interleukin ( IL ) - 4 and IL - 13 are highlighted as major players in allergic inflammation in AD ( 6 - 9 ) . The pathogenic importance of IL - 4 and IL - 13 has recently been suggested by an excellent treatment response of AD to the anti - IL - 4 receptor α ( IL4R ) antibody dupilumab , which inhibits both IL - 4 and IL - 13 signals ( Figure 2 ) ( 10 ) . Figure 1 . Characteristics of atopic dermatitis . Although the mechanisms responsible for barrier dysfunction in AD are multidirectional and interconnected , research has underscored loss - of - function mutations and / or a type 2 immune response - induced decrease in filaggrin ( FLG ) ( 11 - 13 ) . In addition to the genetic loss of FLG , type 2 cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 13 potently inhibit FLG expression ( 11 , 14 - 16 ) . In addition , keratinocytes in the barrier - disrupted skin accelerate the type 2 immune response by producing thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) , IL - 25 and IL - 33 , which are type 2 - associated epithelial cytokines ( 17 ) . Chronic pruritus and pruritus - induced sleep disturbances markedly deteriorate the life quality of the patients ( 18 - 23 ) . Among various pruritogens , atopic itch is likely to be mediated by IL - 31 , which is produced by Th2 cells ( 24 ) . In parallel , the anti - IL - 31 receptor antibody nemolizumab potently improves pruritus in AD patients as early as one week following its administration ( Figure 2 ) ( 25 , 26 ) . In this review , the focus is on type 2 immune deviation as the major driving force of AD development . Pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis Iran . J . Immunol . VOL . 16 NO . 2 June 2019 99 Figure 2 . Pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis . Barrier - disrupted keratinocytes are potent producers of immunoregulatory cytokines such as TSLP , IL - 25 and IL - 33 . These cytokines induce a type 2 immune response . TSLP and IL - 25 activate dendritic cells ( DCs ) to express OX40L . Most allergens possess protease activity . The protease allergens cleave full - length IL - 33 to the active form and activate group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) to express OX40L . Ligation of OX40L / OX40 initiates type 2 immune differentiation of T cells . IL - 17C is also involved in keratinocyte proliferation and is a potential inducer of type 2 inflammation . Th2 cells produce IL - 4 , IL - 13 , IL - 31 and IL - 5 . IL - 4 and IL - 13 inhibit barrier function by downregulating FLG expression via IL - 24 induction or inhibition of OVOL1 function in keratinocytes . IL - 22 induces keratinocyte proliferation and downregulates FLG expression . IL - 31 stimulates sensory nerves and mediates pruritus . IL - 4 and IL - 13 amplify IL - 31 - induced and histamine - induced pruritus . Pruritus evokes scratching , which aggravates barrier disruption . IL - 31 also downregulates FLG expression . The barrier - disrupted epidermis is susceptible to colonization of Staphylococcus aureus , which further worsens barrier disruption . IL - 4 and IL - 13 stimulate B cells to produce IgE , which binds to mast cells and induces their degranulation upon binding to allergens . Mast cells are a major source of histamine . IL - 4 and IL - 13 upregulate the production of CCL17 , CCL22 and CCL26 . These chemokines as well as IL - 5 recruit Th2 cells and eosinophils . Thus , interconnected vicious cycles develop full - blown AD . FLG ; filaggrin , Th2 cell ; T helper type 2 cell , TSLP ; thymic stromal lymphopoietin . Furue M , et al . Iran . J . Immunol . VOL . 16 NO . 2 June 2019 100 IL - 4R Signaling Plays a Crucial Role in Atopic Dermatitis . The anti - IL4R antibody dupilumab significantly improved skin lesions and pruritus in patients with moderate to severe AD in two randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trials ( 10 ) . The severity of AD is authentically evaluated using Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI ) . At 16 - week post - treatment , a reduction in the EASI of at least 75 % was observed in 51 % and 44 % of patients in the dupilumab monotherapy groups , and in only 15 % and 12 % of patients in placebo groups , respectively ( 10 ) . Dupilumab also provides clinically meaningful improvement in patient - reported outcome measures ( 27 ) . IL - 4 and IL - 13 have historically been the focus of much attention in AD . As IL4R receives signals from both IL - 4 and IL - 13 , the therapeutic success of dupilumab testifies to the pivotal roles of IL - 4 and IL - 13 in the pathogenesis of AD ( Figure 2 ) , a notion supported by a series of studies . Gene expression of IL - 4 and IL - 13 is upregulated in the lesional skin of pediatric and adult AD patients compared to that in the normal skin of healthy controls ( 7 - 9 ) . Type 2 predominance is likely to be progressive from nonlesional to lesional skin and from acute to chronic lesions in AD ( 7 , 8 ) . Type 2 predominance is corroborated in peripheral blood Th cells ( 28 ) . IL - 13 - producing Th2 cells are significantly increased in the skin - homing cutaneous lymphocyte antigen ( CLA ) + Th cell population in both pediatric and adult AD patients in comparison to those in the healthy controls ( 28 ) . CCL17 , CCL18 , CCL22 and CCL26 are type 2 chemokines overexpressed in the lesional skin of AD ( 6 , 29 ) ( Figure 2 ) . CCL17 , CCL18 and CCL22 are chemoattractive to Th2 cells and are mainly produced by dendritic cells and other dermal cells activated by IL - 4 and IL - 13 ( 6 , 29 , 30 ) . Concerning CCL17 , platelets are probably the important source ( 31 ) , and serum CCL17 levels became undetectable in a certain patient with AD comorbid with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( 32 ) . CCL26 is a potent chemotactic factor for eosinophils and is generated by endothelial cells stimulated by IL - 4 and IL - 13 ( 6 , 29 ) . The expression levels of these type 2 chemokines are normalized by dupilumab and topical steroids ( 29 , 33 ) . Serum levels of CCL17 and CCL22 are significantly augmented in patients with AD compared to those in healthy controls and are associated with disease severity in AD ( 34 , 35 ) . Interstitial fluids contain significantly higher levels of IL - 13 and CCL17 in the lesional skin of AD patients compared to those in healthy individuals ( 36 ) . Increased levels of CCL17 and CCL22 are further reported in tape - stripped stratum corneum in AD ( 37 ) . IL - 5 is also a type 2 cytokine crucial for eosinophil growth , differentiation and migration ( 38 ) . Gene expression of IL - 5 is upregulated in the lesional skin of pediatric and adult AD patients compared to the normal skin of healthy controls ( 7 - 9 ) . Administration of the anti - IL - 5 antibody mepolizumab significantly reduces circulating eosinophils ; however , no significant improvement is observed in the severity score or pruritus in patients with AD ( 38 ) . These clinical results suggest that IL - 5 plays a major role in the recruitment of eosinophils , but its pathogenic significance is limited in AD . IL - 22 Perpetuates the Chronicity of Atopic Dermatitis . In addition to IL - 4 and IL - 13 , the increased expression of IL - 22 is associated with type 2 dominance in AD , and is also progressive from nonlesional to lesional skin and from acute to chronic lesions ( 7 , 8 ) . Serum levels of IL - 22 are significantly correlated with serum levels of CCL17 ( 39 ) . IL - 22 is a potent inducer of keratinocyte proliferation ( 40 ) . An increased number of circulating IL - 22 + CLA + Th cells were detected in adult patients but not in pediatric patients with AD ( 28 ) . Notably , the anti - IL - 22 antibody fezakinumab exhibits clear efficacy for AD and is more efficacious in severe AD patients compared with non - severe AD patients ( 41 ) . Patients expressing higher baseline levels of IL - 22 Pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis Iran . J . Immunol . VOL . 16 NO . 2 June 2019 101 show a better treatment response to fezakinumab ( 42 ) . Topical steroids and tacrolimus are effective in downregulating the gene expression of IL - 13 and IL - 22 and improving skin symptoms ( 33 , 43 , 44 ) . These results underline the critical role of IL - 22 in AD , particularly in the chronic phase ( 41 ) . IL - 4R Signaling Downregulates Filaggrin Expression . Skin barrier formation is a sophisticated biochemical sequence composed of epidermal differentiation molecules such as FLG , intercellular lipids and corneocyte adhesion ( 12 ) . The expression of FLG is downregulated in the lesional and nonlesional skin of AD compared with the normal skin of healthy individuals ( 11 , 14 ) . Among the 31 susceptible gene loci reported by meta - analysis of genome - wide association studies , FLG , OVOL1 and IL13 are the top 3 significant genes associated with AD ( 13 ) . The most potent risk factors are null mutations of the FLG gene in AD ( 13 ) . However , FLG mutations are not found in all AD patients , are less common in Southern Europeans ( 45 ) , and are even absent in certain African countries ( 46 , 47 ) , suggesting that FLG mutations only partly explain FLG protein downregulation in AD . OVOL1 is an upstream transcription factor for FLG expression ( 14 , 48 ) ( Figure 2 ) . Activation of OVOL1 induces its cytoplasmic - to - nuclear translocation and upregulates FLG expression ( 14 , 48 ) . Notably , type 2 cytokines IL - 4 and IL - 13 consistently inhibit FLG expression by interfering with OVOL1 signaling ( 11 , 14 - 16 , 48 , 49 ) . IL - 4 signaling also disrupts barrier permeability ( 50 ) and modulates E - cadherin distribution ( 51 ) . Therefore , the IL - 4 / IL - 13 - induced FLG downregulation is likely to be more meaningful compared with the genetic mutation of FLG . IL - 13 also stimulates keratinocytes to produce IL - 24 , inhibiting FLG expression in autocrine and / or paracrine fashions ( 52 ) . Other cytokines , such as IL - 20 , IL - 22 , IL - 25 , IL - 31 and IL - 33 , also entail the downregulation of FLG expression ( 53 - 56 ) ; however , the molecular mechanisms leading to FLG downregulation by these cytokines are not fully fathomed . IL - 20 and IL - 24 are partly responsible for IL - 31 - mediated FLG downregulation ( 54 ) . Skin Barrier Dysfunction Induces Type 2 Immune Deviation by Producing TSLP , IL - 24 , IL - 25 and IL - 33 . Epicutaneous application of picryl chloride or mite antigen on barrier - disrupted skin , upregulates IL - 4 and IgE expression in the regional lymph node , compared to sensitization through barrier - intact skin ( 57 ) . Barrier disruption by tape stripping upregulates the expression of CCL17 , CCL22 and CCL5 in epidermal cells , and induces the recruitment of IL - 4 - producing cells and eosinophils ( 58 ) . Current studies suggest the crucial roles of TSLP , IL - 25 and IL - 33 in the type 2 immune deviation induced by barrier dysfunction ( 17 , 59 ) ( Figure 2 ) . In the lesional skin of AD , the expression of TSLP , IL - 25 and IL - 33 is upregulated by epidermal keratinocytes ( 7 , 60 , 61 ) . Tape stripped skin expresses an increased level of TSLP ( 62 ) . TSLP upregulates the expression of OX40L in murine dendritic cells , and TSLP - treated dendritic cells induce OX40 + T cells to produce IL - 4 , IL - 5 and IL - 13 ( 63 , 64 ) . OX40L / OX40 interaction works as a type 2 immune checkpoint ( 64 , 65 ) . Additionally , TSLP - treated human dendritic cells are preferentially prime naïve T cells producing IL - 4 , IL - 5 and IL - 13 ( 61 ) . In addition , TSLP upregulates the production of CCL17 and CCL22 by human dendritic cells ( 61 ) . IL - 25 , also called IL - 17E , is a member of the IL - 17 family ( 66 ) . Th2 immune responses characterized by eosinophilia , increased serum levels of IgE , and an elevated expression of IL - 4 , IL - 5 , and IL - 13 , are observed in transgenic mice that overexpress IL - 25 ( 67 ) . Intranasal administration of IL - 25 upregulates the expression of IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 13 and Furue M , et al . Iran . J . Immunol . VOL . 16 NO . 2 June 2019 102 eotaxin with marked eosinophilia in lung tissues ( 68 ) . IL - 25 further upregulates OX40L in dendritic cells and promotes IL - 4 and IL - 13 production in T cells ( 69 ) . Among other IL - 17 family members , mention can be made of IL - 17C , potentially important in AD because the anti - IL - 17C antibody may be efficacious in the treatment of AD ( 70 ) . IL - 17C may be related to epidermal proliferation and thickening ( 71 ) . In contrast , the blockade of the IL - 17A pathways may exacerbate AD ( 72 ) . IL - 33 is a tissue - derived IL - 1 family cytokine which also facilitates type 2 immune responses ( 73 ) . Barrier disruption by tape stripping induces IL - 33 production in keratinocytes ( 74 ) . IL - 33 expression by keratinocytes is markedly augmented by herpes infection , which , more often than not , aggravates AD and results in distinct eruptions , known as Kaposi’s varicelliform eruptions ( 75 ) . House dust mites activate keratinocytes via toll - like receptor 6 and induce IL - 25 and IL - 33 production ( 76 ) . Many potent allergens such as house dust mites , fungi and pollens have intrinsic protease activity ( 73 , 77 , 78 ) . Full - length IL - 33 released from epithelial cells is cleaved to the mature active form by various sorts of protease allergens , and cleaved IL - 33 generates IL - 5 and IL - 13 by immune cells , and recruits eosinophils ( 73 ) . Therefore , IL - 33 acts as a sensitive sensor of external protease allergens ( 73 ) . IL - 33 , but not TSLP , upregulates OX40L in group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) and stimulates OX40 + T cells towards type 2 immune deviation ( 65 ) . IL - 25 also induces OX40L in ILC2 , but to a lesser extent compared with IL - 33 ( 63 ) . Mouse and human ILC2s are phenotypically comparable , lineage negative , and non T - , non B - lymphocytes and are high producers of IL - 13 and IL - 5 , but not IL - 4 ( 79 , 80 ) . ILC2 resides in the skin and is increased in number in AD lesion ( 80 ) . IL - 33 as well as IL - 25 stimulates ILC2 and promotes Th2 response by enhancing their release of IL - 13 and IL - 5 ( 80 ) . In Schistosoma mansoni infection , individual ablation of TSLP , IL - 25 , or IL - 33 had no impact on the development of IL - 4 - and IL - 13 - dependent inflammation or fibrosis ( 81 ) . However , simultaneous disruption of all three cytokines ameliorates the type 2 deviation ( 81 ) . Further studies are warranted to elucidate the significance and redundancy of TSLP , IL - 25 and IL - 33 . Notably , a clinical trial of the anti - TSLP antibody tezepelumab failed to show the efficacy of AD ( 82 ) , while the anti - IL - 33 antibody ANB020 was efficacious in all 12 AD patients in a phase 2a clinical trial ( 83 ) . Atopic Pruritus and IL - 31 , IL - 4 and IL - 13 . Pruritus is the fundamental symptom of AD ( 21 ) . Histamine is virtually not a key pruritogenic mediator of AD because the antipruritic effect of antihistamine is limited , and is only appreciated by patients when antihistamine is used in combination with topical steroids ( 84 ) . IL - 31 is also a Th2 - associated cytokine ( 24 , 85 ) ( Figure 2 ) whose expression is increased in the lesional skin of AD ( 29 ) . IL - 31 promotes the elongation and branching of sensory nerve fibers ( 86 ) . Administration of IL - 31 induces pruritus in mammals such as mice , dogs , monkeys and humans ( 24 ) . A single shot of the anti - IL - 31 receptor antibody nemolizumab significantly and rapidly reduces pruritus in patients with AD ( 25 , 26 ) . Monthly injection of nemolizumab effectively reduces pruritis in AD for at least 52 weeks ( 87 ) . The anti - canine IL - 31 antibody lokivetmab is already commercially available in the treatment of dogs with canine AD ( 88 ) . These results point to the crucial role of IL - 31 in atopic pruritus . Murine and human sensory neurons express IL - 4 and IL - 13 receptors , but a simple injection of IL - 4 and / or IL - 13 does not induce acute itch ( 89 ) . However , IL - 4 and IL - 13 - pretreated neurons respond to subthreshold concentrations of histamine or IL - 31 , suggesting that IL - 4 and IL - 13 amplify histamine - and IL - 31 - induced pruritus ( 89 ) . Both IL - 31 receptor and IL - 4 receptor α activate downstream JAK1 / JAK2 Pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis Iran . J . Immunol . VOL . 16 NO . 2 June 2019 103 and JAK1 / JAK3 signaling pathways , respectively ( 24 ) . Targeted disruption of the neuronal JAK1 signaling pathway reduces chronic pruritus , corroborating the success of JAK inhibitors in treating chronic pruritus ( 89 , 90 ) . DISCUSSION The therapeutic success of dupilumab underpins the pivotal role of IL - 4 and IL - 13 signaling in the pathogenesis of AD ( 29 ) . Another type 2 cytokine , IL - 31 , is a potent pruritogenic mediator of atopic pruritus . IL - 4 , IL - 13 and IL - 31 inhibit FLG expression and conduce to barrier dysfunction . The vicious itch - scratch cycle further exacerbates epidermal barrier disruption which releases TSLP , IL - 25 and IL - 33 , initiating and perpetuating type 2 immune deviation . The IL - 4 / IL - 13 signal further exacerbates IL - 31 - induced pruritus by reducing the threshold of IL - 31 . Current advances in understanding the pathogenic mechanism may facilitate new drug development in AD .
