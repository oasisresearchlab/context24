Introduction The ability to move is essential for living cells to survive . It may be used in the search for nutrients , such as the motion of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , or for the purpose of reaching another host for pathogens moving inside and between host cells . In both cases , cells face the task of turning chemical energy into linear motion . They have developed a mechanism exploiting the polarity of actin polymers , which prefer to bind monomers at one end and preferentially release them at the other end . Actin is present in abundance in eukaryotic cells and forms semiﬂexible polymers belonging to the cytoskeleton . Bacteria hijack the actin polymerization machinery of host cells for their own purposes . Force generation by semiﬂexible actin polymers is also used for cell motility in many other eukaryotic cells and is crucial for development , regeneration , wound healing and the immune response . The force exerted by the ﬁlaments arises from elastic and entropic contributions since semiﬂexible polymers undergo thermal shape ﬂuctuations [ 1 , 2 ] . This generates propulsion in combination with polymerization . Thus , the leading edge of lamellipodia of crawling cells [ 3 ] is pushed forward by a polymerizing actin meshwork and bacteria move inside cells by riding on a comet tail of growing actin ﬁlaments [ 4 , 5 ] . These in vivo systems of actin - based motility are complemented by in vitro assays using plastic beads , lipid vesicles and oil droplets [ 6 ] – [ 11 ] . Polymerization at the surface of the obstacle generates motion . The same process produces the ﬁlaments which form the actin meshwork further back from the surface . The meshwork provides the support required for exerting a force on the obstacle . Complete understanding of cell motility or pathogen propulsion requires consideration of both the meshwork dynamics and the force generation and polymerization dynamics close to the obstacle surface in the so - called polymer brush . A macroscopic theory for the meshwork as an active gel was developed recently [ 12 ] – [ 14 ] . Here , we focus on the dynamics of polymerization and force generation . Mathematical models have quantiﬁed the force generated by actin ﬁlaments growing against obstacles [ 1 , 2 , 15 ] . The resisting force depends on the obstacle which is pushed . In the case of pathogens , it consists mainly of the force exerted by actin ﬁlaments bound to the surface of the bacterium and pulling it backwards [ 16 , 17 ] . The tethered ratchet model [ 18 ] is a mathematical formulation of these experimental ﬁndings . It focuses on the dynamics of the number of attached and detached polymers . In contrast with that , we will start from the dynamics of distributions of the free length of the polymer . Actin polymerization is controlled by a complex molecular network [ 5 ] . Nucleation of new ﬁlaments , capping of existing ones , exchange of ADP for ATP on actin monomers , buffering of monomers , etc all contribute to that control and have been modeled [ 18 ] – [ 20 ] . Our goal is not to model the full complexity of that biochemical network . We rather focus on the core process of force generation and force balance resulting from the interplay between bound pulling ﬁlaments and polymerizing pushing ﬁlaments , the transition between these two groups and the motion of the whole force - generating conﬁguration . This is motivated by recent observations of complex dynamics in simple reconstituted systems : the velocity of beads , pathogens or oil droplets propelled by actin polymerization may oscillate [ 11 ] , [ 21 ] – [ 23 ] . Our goal is to describe the dynamics of such biochemically simpler systems and ﬁnd a robust microscopic description for oscillation mechanisms , which may then be controlled by higher order processes .

Schematic representation of an ensemble of actin ﬁlaments in the brush oriented at ϑ = 0 with respect to the normal ˆ n of an obstacle interface . While attached ﬁlaments are under tension and pull the interface back , detached ﬁlaments are compressed , polymerize with rate k on and push the interface forward . All ﬁlaments are ﬁrmly anchored in a crosslinked meshwork , whose front advances with velocity v g reducing the free contour length l of the ﬁlaments in the brush . Attached ﬁlaments detach with stress dependent rate k d and detached ﬁlaments attach with constant rate k a . v o is the interface velocity in the extracellular medium , and x is the distance between the front of the meshwork and the interface . We will describe the model in the following section . Section 3 describes the results of simulations and bifurcation analyses and section 4 will relate our results to experiments and to previous work on simple models of actin - based motility . 2 . A simple model of actin - based motility The dynamics of the total number of ﬁlaments N are due to nucleation of new ﬁlaments and capping of existing ones . Capped ﬁlaments stop polymerizing and drop out of the dynamics . But to keep matters simple and based on the assumption that nucleation and capping balance we neglect N - dynamics . We consider a ﬁxed number N of actin ﬁlaments . It was shown experimentally by Brieher et al [ 24 ] that propulsion with a constant number of ﬁlaments is possible , although the authors did not report saltatory motion . The ﬁxed number of ﬁlaments implies that we will not reproduce changes in F - actin density in actin comet tails as reported to be associated with saltatory motion [ 11 , 22 ] . The ﬁlaments are ﬁrmly anchored into a rigid crosslinked meshwork , which advances with velocity v g ; for an illustration see ﬁgure 1 . We consider the processes in the polymer brush between the crosslinked meshwork and the surface of the obstacle which is pushed by actin polymerization . Severing and depolymerization can be neglected for the brush dynamics according to experimental ideas on processes in actin comet tails and lamellipodia [ 25 ] . New Journal of Physics 10 ( 2008 ) 033022 ( http : / / www . njp . org / ) 4 Filaments of variable free length l are either attached to the obstacle surface via a protein complex or detached from it . The two populations are speciﬁed by time - dependent number distributions denoted N a ( l , t ) and N d ( l , t ) , respectively . Filaments in the detached state polymerize with a velocity v p ( l , x ) , which depends on both the polymer length l and the distance x between rigid support and obstacle . The constant attachment rate k a and a stress - dependent detachment rate k d [ 26 ] describe the transitions between the two ﬁlament populations . Attachment occurs during nucleation of new ﬁlaments . They nucleate from activated Arp2 / 3 which is activated and inserted into existing ﬁlaments by protein complexes bound to the obstacle surface including e . g . ActA and WASP ( see the review [ 25 ] and references therein ) . While we consider the total number of ﬁlaments to be constant , we do not neglect this transient attachment aspect of nucleation . Another putative transient attachment is mediated by the isolated WH2 domain of N - WASP which forms a complex with G - actin . This complex can bind barbed ends and mediates their binding to the bacterium ( [ 25 , 27 ] and references therein ) . We lump both attachment processes into one rate law since both rates are proportional to N d ( l , t ) . The evolution of the length distributions N a ( l , t ) and N d ( l , t ) obeys an advection – reaction equation : ∂ ∂ t N d − ∂ ∂ l (cid:20) max (cid:18) l x , 1 (cid:19) v g ( l ) − v p (cid:21) N d = − k a N d + k d N a , ( 1 a ) ∂ ∂ t N a − ∂ ∂ l (cid:20) max (cid:18) l x , 1 (cid:19) v g ( l ) (cid:21) N a = k a N d − k d N a . ( 1 b ) The right - hand side of equations ( 1 ) describes attachment and detachment processes . The second term on the left - hand side accounts for the gain and loss of the free length of the polymer due to the dynamics of the polymer mesh , growing with velocity v g , and the polymerization kinetics of the ﬁlaments in the brush v p . The graft velocity v g has the direction orthogonal to the graft boundary . This is not the tangential direction of polymers if polymers are bent or tilted . However , the advection term in equations ( 1 ) requires velocities along the contour of ﬁlaments . The correction factor max ( lx , 1 ) turns v g into such a velocity , i . e . the rate with which the graft swallows contour length . It was derived with the assumption that ﬁlaments extend all the way from the graft to the obstacle wall which is the case with precision sufﬁcient for this purpose ( see section 3 ) . The graft point represents the boundary between the polymer brush and the bulk gel of the actin comet tail [ 28 ] . Consequently , the complete description of the motion of the graft would require solving the bulk gel equations for the comet tail [ 12 ] . However , this would be far beyond the purpose of this project , which focuses on processes in the polymer brush very much in the spirit of the tethered ratchet model [ 18 ] . The coupling between the obstacle surface and gel boundary we assume here entails a graft velocity independent of the obstacle velocity at large polymer length ( l (cid:29) ¯ l , see below ) and a graft velocity equal to the obstacle velocity at small polymer length , i . e . when the brush disappears . Processes contributing to the growth of the rigid polymer mesh are entanglement and crosslinking of ﬁlaments in the brush . Both imply a vanishing v g for l → 0 , since short polymers do not entangle and crosslinking proteins are unlikely to bind to them . At the same time v g New Journal of Physics 10 ( 2008 ) 033022 ( http : / / www . njp . org / ) 5 cannot grow without bound but must saturate at some value v maxg due to rate limitations for crosslinking and entanglement . This suggests taking the following sigmoidal form : v g ( l ) = v maxg tanh ( l / ¯ l ) , ( 2 ) with a characteristic length scale ¯ l . The constant ¯ l could be perceived as the width of the brush gel boundary . The polymerization rate is proportional to the probability of a gap of sufﬁcient size d ( ≈ 2 . 7 nm ) between the polymer tip and the obstacle for insertion of an actin monomer as was calculated in [ 1 ] . This implies an exponential dependence of v p on the force F d by which the polymer pushes against the obstacle , v p ( l , x ) = v maxp exp [ − d · F d ( l , x ) / k B T ] . ( 3 ) Here , v maxp ≈ 500 nm s − 1 [ 1 ] is the force - free polymerization velocity . For the entropic force F d we use the results obtained in [ 2 ] for D = 2 and 3 spatial dimensions , where we take the accepted value of ‘ p ≈ 15 µ m [ 29 , 30 ] for the persistence length of F - actin . The dynamics of the distance x between the grafted end of the ﬁlament and the obstacle interface ( see ﬁgure 1 ) is given by the difference of the average v g and the velocity of the obstacle ∂ t x = − 1 N Z ∞ 0 d l v g ( l ) [ N a ( l , t ) + N d ( l , t ) ] + 1 ζ Z ∞ 0 d l [ N a ( l , t ) F a ( l , x ) + N d ( l , t ) F d ( l , x ) ] , ( 4 ) where ζ is an effective friction coefﬁcient of the obstacle . Note that | F a | , | F d | (cid:29) ζ v o holds , with v o denoting the obstacle velocity . The polymerization force and the force exerted by bound ﬁlaments dominate the force balance in agreement with experimental results reported in [ 31 ] . The force F a ( l , x ) acting on the obstacle interface results from the compliance of the ﬁlaments attached to it by some linker proteins . We model these proteins as springs with spring constant k l and zero equilibrium length . This complex has a nonlinear force – extension relation which we approximate by a piece - wise linear function ; for details see the supplementary material ( available from stacks . iop . org / NJP / 10 / 033022 / mmedia ) . Let R k ≈ l [ 1 − l ( D − 1 ) / 4 ‘ p ] be the average distance from the graft point to the tip of the ﬁlament projected onto the grafting direction . The elastic response of ﬁlaments experiencing small compressional forces ( x 6 R k ) is approximated by a spring constant k k = 12 k B T ‘ 2p / ( D − 1 ) l 4 [ 32 ] . For small pulling forces ( x > R k ) , the linker – ﬁlament complex acts like a spring with an effective constant k eff = k l k k / ( k l + k k ) . In the strong force regime , the force – extension relation of the ﬁlament is highly nonlinear and diverges close to full stretching [ 33 ] . Therefore , only the linker will stretch out . The complete force – extension relation is captured by F a =   − k k ( x − R k ) , x 6 R k , − k eff ( x − R k ) , R k < x < l , − k l ( x − l ) − k eff ( l − R k ) , x > l . ( 5 ) Finally , we specify the force dependence of the detachment rate according to [ 26 ] by k d = k 0d exp [ − d · F a ( l , x ) / k B T ] ( 6 ) with k 0d ≈ 0 . 5 s − 1 [ 18 ] . Equation ( 1 a ) has a singularity at v p ( l s ) = max ( 1 , l s / x ) v g ( l s ) since the coefﬁcient of the derivative of N d with respect to l is zero at l s . The existence of this singularity sets the New Journal of Physics 10 ( 2008 ) 033022 ( http : / / www . njp . org / ) 6 Figure 2 . The evolution of the solution of equation ( 7 ) . The width of the initial Gaussian distribution of detached ﬁlaments decreases exponentially with time and the peak of the distribution grows and localizes around l s . In the full system , l s is close to x since v p drops from v maxp to almost 0 in a narrow range around l = x . length distribution dynamics of equation ( 1 a ) apart from distribution dynamics of polymers in solution [ 34 , 35 ] . To illustrate the key physical features at that singularity , we start with the simple equation ∂ t N d − ∂ l [ max ( 1 , l / x ) v g ( l ) − v p ( l , x ) ] N d = 0 with x kept constant . Then , those parts of the distribution of N d with l < l s will grow and catch up with l s since max ( 1 , l / x ) v g ( l ) − v p ( l , x ) is positive there , while the parts with l > l s will shorten towards l s . As a consequence , the whole distribution will become concentrated at l s . To quantify this heuristic argument , we expand max ( 1 , l / x ) v g ( l ) − v p ( l , x ) up to linear order around l s like v 1 ( l − l s ) and obtain the advection equation ∂ ∂ t N d − ∂ ∂ l [ v 1 ( l − l s ) ] N d = 0 , ( 7 ) which we solve by the method of characteristics . Starting initially with a Gaussian distribution we obtain N d ( l , t ) = c ( t ) exp [ − ( l − ¯ l ( t ) ) 2 / w ( t ) 2 ] with c ( t ) = c 0 exp ( v 1 t ) , ¯ l ( t ) = l s + ( ¯ l 0 − l s ) exp ( − v 1 t ) and w ( t ) = w 0 exp ( − v 1 t ) . This shows that N d evolves to a monodisperse distribution which is localized around l s . Its width decreases exponentially with time while its height grows exponentially . The timescale for this contraction is given by [ ∂ l ( max ( 1 , l / x ) v g − v p ) ] − 1 and is in the range of 10 − 2 s ( for details see the supplementary material , available from stacks . iop . org / NJP / 10 / 033022 / mmedia ) . This is 1 – 2 orders of magnitude faster than any other time constant of the system . The temporal evolution of the solution of equation ( 7 ) is shown in ﬁgure 2 . Since the same kind of singularity also occurs in the full set of dynamic equations , equations ( 1 a ) and ( 1 b ) , we may readily infer that N a and N d evolve into delta - functions with that dynamics . This is well supported by simulations , and allows us to continue with the ansatz N d ( l , t ) = n d ( t ) δ ( l − l d ( t ) ) , ( 8 a ) N a ( l , t ) = n a ( t ) δ ( l − l a ( t ) ) . ( 8 b ) New Journal of Physics 10 ( 2008 ) 033022 ( http : / / www . njp . org / ) 7 It deﬁnes the dynamic variables n d ( t ) , l d ( t ) , n a ( t ) and l a ( t ) . Upon inserting equations ( 8 a ) and ( 8 b ) into ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , multiplying ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) by l and integrating over l , we obtain ∂ t l d ( t ) = v p ( l d , x ) − max (cid:18) l d x , 1 (cid:19) v g ( l d ) + k d n a n d ( l a − l d ) , ( 9 a ) ∂ t l a ( t ) = − max (cid:18) l a x , 1 (cid:19) v g ( l a ) + k a n d n a ( l d − l a ) , ( 9 b ) ∂ t n a ( t ) = − k d ( l a , x ) n a ( t ) + k a n d ( t ) , ( 9 c ) ∂ t x ( t ) = 1 ζ [ n a ( t ) F a ( l a , x ) + n d ( t ) F d ( l d , x ) ] − 1 N [ v g ( l a ) n a ( t ) + v g ( l d ) n d ( t ) ] , ( 9 d ) where n d ( t ) = N − n a ( t ) , since we keep the total number of ﬁlaments ﬁxed . The most obvious differences between these equations and the tethered ratchet model are the dynamics of x ( t ) , l d ( t ) and l a ( t ) [ 18 ] . The values of many parameters of equations ( 9 ) can be estimated using known properties of actin ﬁlaments . We choose the linker spring constant k l ≈ 1 pN nm − 1 [ 18 ] and assume N = 200 [ 18 ] ﬁlaments to be crowded behind the obstacle . A realistic value of the drag coefﬁcient ζ is 10 − 3 pN s nm − 1 but results did not change qualitatively for a range from 10 − 5 to 1 pN s nm − 1 . 3 . Results We have numerically solved equations ( 9 ) in both D = 2 and 3 dimensions , and found the dynamic regimes shown in ﬁgure 3 : stationary states and oscillations . The existence of an oscillatory regime is very robust against changes of parameters within reasonable limits including the spatial dimension . We checked robustness against changes in the parameter values for N , ¯ l ( see equation ( 2 ) ) , k l , ζ and k 0d , in addition to the examples shown in ﬁgure 3 . In general , we ﬁnd that oscillations occur for v maxg . 500 nm s − 1 and within a range of values for k a . Figure 3 ( d ) demonstrates that changing v maxp leads to a transition from steady to saltatory motion . v maxp can be controlled by the concentration of free G - actin in experiments . Oscillations are found for v maxg < v maxp only . Otherwise , the graft catches up with the obstacle and stays very close to it resulting in motion with constant velocity . Starting at k a = 0 , we ﬁnd an onset of oscillations upon increasing k a at the lower boundary of the oscillatory region . The stationary state changes stability slightly inside the oscillatory regime and oscillations set in with a ﬁnite period and an amplitude different from 0 ; compare the example shown in ﬁgure 4 ( a ) . That is compatible with a saddle node bifurcation of limit cycles . A transition from steady to oscillatory motion upon increasing protein concentration in the extract is experimentally observed with beads [ 23 ] . An increase of protein concentration would also increase the binding rate k a . Therefore , we assume that the onset of oscillations observed in these experiments corresponds to the lower transition line in ﬁgures 3 ( a ) – ( c ) , in particular since the measured oscillations start also with a large amplitude and ﬁnite period and the coexistence of steady and oscillatory motion close to the transition reported in [ 23 ] is reproduced by the model ( we assume a subcritical Hopf bifurcation in the model , see [ 36 ] ) . The upper boundary of the oscillatory region is determined by a Hopf bifurcation . An example of an oscillation close to that bifurcation is shown in ﬁgure 4 ( b ) .

Phase diagram of a brush with two populations of ﬁlaments , one oriented at 0 ◦ and the other one at ± 45 ◦ , outlining oscillatory and stationary regimes in D = 3 . Other parameter values are the same as in ﬁgure 3 ( c ) . oil droplets upon adding VASP to the medium is reported in [ 11 ] . The authors explain this onset by de - adhesion activity of VASP which could not be speciﬁed on the molecular level . The bifurcation diagram in ﬁgure 3 suggests that this onset of oscillations corresponds to the upper transition with an emergence of oscillations upon decreasing k a . This bifurcation line can also be crossed by increasing the dissociation rate k 0d , which would correspond to a different way of de - adhesion activity ( data not shown ) . More details on the phase diagram will be published elsewhere [ 36 ] . We have also studied the system when the network is oriented at an angle ϑ = π / 4 . In this case , the spring constant of the attached ﬁlaments parallel to ˆ n for D = 2 reads k − 1 k ( ϑ ) = 4 ‘ 2p [ (cid:15) 2 + e − (cid:15) / 2 − 1 + cos 2 ϑ ( 14 + 112 e − 2 (cid:15) − 13 e − (cid:15) / 2 ) − cos 2 ϑ ( e − (cid:15) / 2 − 1 ) 2 ] / k B T , where (cid:15) = l / ‘ p and R k ( ϑ ) = l ( 1 − l / 4 ‘ p ) cos ϑ [ 32 ] . For the pushing force of a ﬁlament grafted at ϑ = π / 4 , we use the results of the factorization approximation given in [ 2 ] , which is valid for a stiff ﬁlament - like actin . A numerical solution of equations ( 9 ) with the adapted forms of F d and F a results in the phase diagram shown in ﬁgure 3 ( b ) . Experimentally observed actin meshworks exhibit a range of ﬁlament orientations and therefore oscillations should work with ﬁlaments of different orientations in the brush . Their dynamics is coupled by the obstacle . Figure 3 ( b ) shows the oscillatory regime of a network with ﬁlaments at ± 45 ◦ in two dimensions ( 2D ) . Results of simulations modeling a brush with ﬁlaments with angles of 0 ◦ and ± 45 ◦ in 3D are shown in ﬁgure 5 . Such a brush oscillates also . These results imply that a brush comprising orientations between − 45 ◦ and + 45 ◦ would oscillate as well , since the overlap of the oscillatory regimes of tilted and orthogonal ﬁlaments increases with decreasing | ϑ | . We start with the description of the push – pull mechanism of the oscillations in the phase with v g > v p , i . e . decreasing lengths x , l a and l d ; see ﬁgure 4 ( a ) . The magnitude of pulling and pushing forces increases due to their length dependence . When the pushing force becomes too strong , an avalanche - like detachment of attached ﬁlaments is triggered and the obstacle jerks forward ; compare the steep rise in l d , l a and x shown in ﬁgure 4 ( a ) . That causes a just as sudden drop in the pushing force . With low pushing force now , polymerization accelerates and New Journal of Physics 10 ( 2008 ) 033022 ( http : / / www . njp . org / ) 10 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 4000 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 S p ee d ( µ m s – 1 ) Time ( s ) Time ( s ) ( a ) Speed Displacement 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 500 1000 1500 2000 25000 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 D i s p l ace m e n t ( µ m ) ( b ) Speed Displacement Figure6 .

Theperiodof velocity oscillations of beads propelled by actin polymerization differs from those of Listeria by one order of magnitude ( 8 − 15 min [ 23 ] ) and velocities are much smaller . These periods and velocities can be obtained within our model with smaller values for v maxg and v maxp ( see ﬁgure 6 ( b ) ) . However , experimental oscillations of bead velocities show a peak broader than the simulated ones [ 23 ] . As mentioned above , actin density variations in the comet tail of beads and pathogens accompany the velocity oscillations in experiments . These density variations do not occur in our model . This demonstrates that they are not required for the velocity to oscillate . The variations in pulling and pushing forces driving the push – pull mechanism do not arise from density changes but from the length oscillations of attached and detached ﬁlaments via the force – extension relations of semiﬂexible polymers . The push – pull mechanism is not in contradiction to the observed density variations and their phase relation with respect to the velocity time course . Both pulling and pushing forces increase with the ﬁlament density . Therefore , the force changes resulting from density variation would not counteract the force changes occurring in our model but probably support and amplify them .

Conclusions In summary , we derived a simple model for velocity dynamics in actin - based motility by starting from the dynamics of length distributions of a free polymer in the brush . We have presented a theoretical description of oscillations arising from the interplay of polymerization - driven pushing forces and pulling forces due to binding of actin ﬁlaments to the obstacle . The mechanism relies on the load dependence of the detachment rate and the polymerization velocity . The model uses parameter values determined from measurements . It reproduces the dynamic regimes of actin - based motility observed with obstacles riding on an actin comet tail , the type of bifurcation observed in bead experiments upon an increase in protein concentration and the onset of oscillations in oil droplet motion upon VASP addition . Oscillations are observed for a range of tilt angles of the ﬁlaments as required for modeling of actin brushes of experimentally observed actin comet tails . A recent review by Mogilner distinguishes microscopic models and continuum models [ 38 ] . The tethered ratchet model is the prototypical microscopic model since it starts from the properties of individual ﬁlaments . Our model belongs to the same group . Velocity oscillations have not been explained yet with microscopic models . Here , we show that this class of models can reproduce oscillations also . In contrast with the tethered ratchet model , equations ( 9 ) include dynamics of the lengths x , l a and l d . This appears to be the reason why our model oscillates so robustly while the tethered ratchet model shows steady motion only . An alternative theoretical explanation of Listeria and bead propulsion by actin polymerization was given by the continuum model , which perceives the actin meshwork as a continuous gel [ 22 , 23 , 37 ] . It explains the oscillatory motion as a consequence of tangential stress which arises when an actin gel grows from the inside outwards on bent surfaces . Friction arising from the binding of polymers to the surface keeps the velocity small until the stress is released due to bond rupture and a stick – slip transition occurs ( soap effect ) . The dependence of the reaction rates on load leads to a nonlinear relation between friction force and velocity in the quasi - static regime as shown in conjunction with the derivation of the continuum model [ 22 ] . However , the catastrophic rupture of attached ﬁlaments required for velocity oscillations is not captured by the quasi - static force velocity relation but was assumed to occur at a cut - off value for F d [ 22 , p 2269 ] . Here , we show that it occurs indeed as a consequence of the force dependence of the reaction rates . A way to store elastic energy seems also to be required to obtain oscillations . It is stored in tangential stress of a bent gel in the continuum model [ 22 ] and in the tension between pushing and pulling ﬁlaments in our model . Consequently , the mechanism of thrust generation during the velocity peaks is different in the two models : soap effect [ 22 ] versus push – pull . The oscillations in our model do not require bent obstacle surfaces and are very robust with respect to changes in various parameters , i . e . they appear to be generic . Therefore , complex biochemical regulatory systems supplementing the core process described here may rather stabilize motion and suppress oscillations than generate them . Nevertheless , aspects of the continuum model—like tangential stress—would of course enter our model if curved obstacle surfaces are considered . The formation of tangential stress on curved surfaces provides an explanation for the radius dependence of the onset of oscillations as shown by the continuum model [ 23 ] . Since the push – pull mechanism and the soap effect are not clearly mutually exclusive , identifying which of them applies for a speciﬁc system would require further speciﬁcation of the model as well as further experiments .
