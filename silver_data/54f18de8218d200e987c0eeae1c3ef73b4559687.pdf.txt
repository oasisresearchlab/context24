Fourteen and four proteins were recognised by IgG from at least 75 % of the 15 pools in total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , respectively , whereas 15 protein spots were specifically recognised by IgG from at least four of the ten pools from patients with unidentified ANAs . The IgG intensity for a number of antigens was higher in sera from patients than in sera from healthy controls . These antigens included triosephosphate isomerase , superoxide dismutase mitochondrial precursor , heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L and lamin A / C .

Introduction Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) is a connective tissue disorder characterised by excessive collagen deposition in the dermis and internal organs , vascular hyperreactivity and obliteration phenomena [ 1 ] . A large number of autoanti - bodies have been identified in the sera of SSc patients . Antinuclear antibodies ( ANAs ) , usually detected by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp - 2 cells , are identi - fied in 90 % of patients [ 2 ] . Some of them are disease - specific and mutually exclusive : anticentromere antibo - dies ( ACAs ) , associated with limited cutaneous SSc ( lcSSc ) and possibly pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) ; anti - topoisomerase I antibodies ( ATAs ) , asso - ciated with diffuse cutaneous SSc ( dcSSc ) and interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) ; and anti - RNA polymerase III antibo - dies , associated with dcSSc and scleroderma renal crisis ( SRC ) [ 3 ] . In addition , other autoantibodies have been found in the sera of SSc patients and include antifibril - larin , antifibrillin 1 , anti - Th / To , anti - PM / Scl [ 3 ] , antifi - broblast [ 4 - 6 ] and anti - endothelial cell antibodies [ 7 - 9 ] . Overall , the only specific autoantibodies routinely tested for in SSc patients are ACAs , ATAs and , more recently , anti - RNA polymerase III antibodies . Thus , approximately 10 % of SSc patients have no routi - nely detectable autoantibodies , and for 20 % to 40 % of those with detectable ANAs , the nuclear target antigens of these ANAs have not been identified [ 2 ] . Therefore , further work is warranted to better determine the disease subset and prognosis for these patients . The specification of new autoantibodies could help in understanding the pathophysiology of SSc and reveal new diagnostic and / or prognostic markers . Using a proteomic approach combining two - dimen - sional electrophoresis ( 2 - DE ) and immunoblotting , we recently identified target antigens of antifibroblast anti - bodies in patients with PAH [ 10 ] . In this work , using a similar proteomic approach with total and enriched nuclear protein extracts of HEp - 2 cells as sources of autoantigens , we systematically analysed autoantibodies in SSc patients and identified a number of new target antigens for these autoantibodies . Materials and methods Immunoglobulin sources Sera were obtained from 45 patients who fulfilled the LeRoy and Medsger criteria and / or the American Rheu - matism Association criteria for the diagnosis of SSc . Sera were tested in 15 pools from groups of three patients with the same phenotype as described previously [ 10 ] . Four pools were from patients with identified ANAs ( that is , ACAs , ATAs or anti - RNA polymerase III antibodies ) , ten pools were from patients with unidentified ANAs , and one pool was from patients without ANAs ( Table 1 ) . The sera from three patients with anti - RNA polymerase III antibodies who had experienced SRC were included in one of the two pools from patients with SRC . ANAs and ACAs were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp - 2 cells ; ACAs were characterised by a centro - mere pattern ; ATAs and anti - RNA polymerase III anti - bodies were detected by using an enzyme - linked Table 1 Characteristics of pools of sera used as sources of IgG a Main clinical characteristics Autoimmunity Number of pools tested b Healthy blood donors No ANA 1 dcSSc No visceral involvement No ANA 1 Interstitial lung disease ATA 1 Scleroderma renal crisis Anti - RNA - pol III Abs 1 lcSSc Pulmonary arterial hypertension ACA 1 No visceral involvement ACA 1 dcSSc Scleroderma renal crisis ANA with unidentified specificity 1 Pulmonary arterial hypertension ANA with unidentified specificity 1 Interstitial lung disease ANA with unidentified specificity 2 No visceral involvement ANA with unidentified specificity 1 lcSSc Digital ulcers ANA with unidentified specificity 1 Pulmonary arterial hypertension ANA with unidentified specificity 1 Interstitial lung disease ANA with unidentified specificity 1 No visceral involvement ANA with unidentified specificity 2 a Abs : antibodies ; ACA : anticentromere antibody ; ANA : antinuclear antibody ; anti - RNA - pol III Abs : anti - RNA polymerase III antibodies ; ATA : antitopoisomerase I antibody ; dcSSc : diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis ; lcSSc : limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis ; SSc : systemic sclerosis . b A pool of sera from 12 healthy blood donors was tested as a control . Immunoglobulin G reactivities were tested in pools of three sera from patients with the same phenotype of SSc . Bussone et al .

We used a pool of sera from 12 healthy blood donors as a control . Healthy controls ( HCs ) had no detectable disease , no remarkable medical history and no ANAs and were not taking any medication at the time of blood sampling . Serum samples were stored in aliquots at - 80°C . All patients and HCs gave their written informed consent according to the policies of the ethics commit - tee of Cochin Hospital . They were included in the Hypertension Artérielle Pulmonaire ( HTAP ) - Ig study ( Investigation and Clinical Research ’ s contract 2005 , CIRC 05066 , promoter Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris ) . HEp - 2 cell culture HEp - 2 cells , a cell line derived from a human laryngeal carcinoma , were obtained from EuroBio ( Les Ulis , France ) and cultured as described previously [ 8 ] . When confluent , the cells were detached by use of 0 . 05 % tryp - sin - ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Protein extraction Total proteins were extracted from HEp - 2 cells as described previously [ 11 ] . Briefly , HEp - 2 cells were sus - pended in a sample solution extraction kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , USA ) containing 2 % ( wt / vol ) sulfobetaine zwitterionic detergent ( SB 3 - 10 ) and the carrier ampholyte Bio - Lyte 3 / 10 ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Cell samples were sonicated on ice , and the supernatant was collected after ultracentrifugation . Finally , after protein quantification [ 12 ] , 64 mM dithio - threitol ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was added , and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at - 80°C . A protein extract enriched in nuclear proteins was obtained as previously described [ 13 ] , which is referred to hereinafter as enriched nuclear protein extract . Briefly , HEp - 2 cells were suspended in a buffer contain - ing 10 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfo - nic acid ( HEPES ) , pH 7 . 9 , 10 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 mM ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid ( EGTA ) , 1 mM dithiothreitol and antiproteases . After incubation for 15 minutes on ice , 10 % Nonidet P - 40 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added and cells were vortexed . Cells were then resus - pended , incubated for 15 minutes on ice and regularly vortexed in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 9 , 0 . 4 M NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM dithio - threitol and antiproteases . After ultracentrifugation , the supernatant was washed in a precooled ( - 20°C ) solution of 10 % trichloroacetic acid in acetone with 0 . 07 % 2 - mer - captoethanol ( Sigma - Aldrich ) to eliminate salts as described previously [ 13 ] . Proteins were resuspended in the sample solution extraction kit and then quantified [ 12 ] . Finally , 64 mM dithiothreitol was added , and the sample was aliquoted and stored at - 80°C . Two - dimensional electrophoresis The study protocol is depicted in Figure 1 . We used a pH range of 3 . 0 to 10 . 0 and an acrylamide gradient of 7 % to 18 % , which allowed us to study a wide range of antigens of 10 to 250 kDa [ 11 , 14 ] . Proteins were isoelectrofocused with 17 - cm immobilised pH gradient strips on the Protean IEF Cell System ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) as described previously [ 11 ] . Thus , 100 μ g of HEp - 2 cell proteins from total or enriched nuclear protein extracts were loaded onto each strip . Before the second dimen - sion , the strips were equilibrated and then proteins were transferred to gels as described previously [ 11 , 13 ] . Finally , one gel was stained with ammoniacal silver nitrate to serve as a reference for analysis of 2 - D immunoblots [ 14 ] . Electrotransfer and immunoblotting After migration , proteins were transferred onto polyviny - lidene difluoride membranes ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) by semidry transfer ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) at 320 mA for 90 minutes . After being blocked , membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with each of the sera pools from HCs and patients at a 1 : 100 dilution . Immu - noglobulin G ( IgG ) immunoreactivities were revealed as described previously [ 11 ] . Specific reactivities were deter - mined by densitometrically scanning the membranes ( GS - 800 calibrated densitometer ; Bio - Rad Laboratories ) with Quantity One software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . The membranes were then stained with colloidal gold ( Proto - gold ; British Biocell International , Cardiff , UK ) and underwent secondary densitometric analysis to record labelled protein spots for each membrane . Images of the reference gel and membranes were acquired by using the GS - 800 calibrated densitometer and were analysed by using ImageMaster 2D Platinum 6 . 0 software ( GE Healthcare , Buckinghamshire , UK ) as described previously [ 11 ] . In - gel trypsin digestion Relevant spots were selected by comparing the 2 - D immunoblots with the silver - stained reference gel and then extracted from another gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . In - gel digestion involved the use of trypsin as described previously [ 13 ] , and for all steps a Freedom EVO 100 digester / spotter robot was used ( Tecan , Männedorf , Switzerland ) . Protein identification by mass spectrometry Protein identification involved the use of a matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time of flight ( MALDI - TOF ) - TOF 4800 mass spectrometer ( Applied Bussone et al . Arthritis Research & Therapy 2011 , 13 : R74 http : / / arthritis - research . com / content / 13 / 3 / R74 Page 3 of 13 Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) as previously reported [ 13 ] . Database searching involved the use of Mascot 2 . 2 software ( Matrix Science , London , UK ) and the GPS Explorer version 3 . 6 program ( Applied Biosys - tems ) to combine mass spectrometry ( MS ) and tandem mass spectrometry ( MS / MS ) queries of human proteins from the Swiss - Prot database [ 15 ] . Biological network analysis Protein lists of interest were analysed using Pathway Studio software ( Ariadne , Rockville , MD , USA ) [ 16 ] . Pathway Studio is a pathway analysis tool that uses automated text - mining engines to extract information from the literature . Briefly , protein lists were run against ResNet 7 . 0 , a database of biological relations , ontologies and pathways . ResNet 7 . 0 covers human , mouse and rat proteins . The filters applied included “ all shortest paths between selected entities ” and “ expand pathway ” . The information received was narrowed down to our protein lists to obtain their relationships . Protein entities belonging to different functional groups were repre - sented as different shapes . Figure 1 Experimental design for screening anti - HEp - 2 cell antibodies and identifying target autoantigens in SSc patients . HEp - 2 cell proteins were extracted and separated on two - dimensional ( 2 - D ) gels . Total and enriched nuclear protein extracts were used as substrates for 2 - D electrophoresis . One gel was stained with silver nitrate and used as the reference gel , and proteins of the 11 other gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membranes . Membranes were immunoblotted at 1 : 100 dilution with pooled sera from 12 healthy blood donors or from sets of three patients with the same phenotype of systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . After immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) immunoreactivities were revealed , the 2 - D immunoblots were stained with colloidal gold to visualize the transferred proteins . 2 - D immunoblots were scanned before and after colloidal gold staining with the use of a densitometer , then analysed by using image analysis software , and finally compared with the reference gel . Selected protein spots were extracted from another gel stained with Coomassie brilliant blue , and candidate proteins were identified by mass spectrometry . Database searching was used to identify the antigens . Bussone et al . Arthritis Research & Therapy 2011 , 13 : R74 http : / / arthritis - research . com / content / 13 / 3 / R74 Page 4 of 13 Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviation . Positive identification of proteins by MALDI - TOF - TOF was based on a statistically significant Mascot score ( P < 0 . 05 ) . For peptides matching multiple members of a protein family , the reported protein is the one with the highest number of peptide matches . Results Analysis of HEp - 2 cell proteomes We found 974 and 832 protein spots specifically stained by silver nitrate in HEp - 2 cell total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , respectively ( Figures 2B and 2E and Additional file 1 ) . Major differences were observed between the two HEp - 2 cell proteomes , corresponding to quantitative variation for a given pro - tein spot as well as protein spots that were exclusively detected in one of the two protein extracts . In the total protein extract , a large number of protein spots stained with high intensity migrated between pH 4 . 0 and 7 . 0 and between 100 and 10 kDa . In the enriched nuclear protein extract , a lower number of protein spots was stained with high intensity and migrated between pH 5 . 0 and 9 . 0 and , with several exceptions , between 75 and 30 kDa . After protein transfer and colloidal gold staining , we identified 658 ± 101 and 535 ± 66 protein spots on average per membrane in total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , respectively ( data not shown ) . Again , quantitative and / or qualitative differences were observed between membranes transferred with one or the other of the protein extracts . IgG reactivities shared between SSc patients In the 15 pools of sera from SSc patients , IgG recog - nised , on average per membrane , 142 ± 34 and 155 ± 47 protein spots in HEp - 2 cell total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , respectively , with no significant difference between sera pools ( data not shown ) . Overall , 43 and 33 protein spots were recognised by at least 75 % of pools from patients with dcSSc and / or lcSSc in total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , respectively ( Additional files 2 and 3 ) . Thus , 14 and 4 proteins were identified by MS from the protein spots recognised by at least 75 % of the 15 pools in total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , respectively ( Table 2 ) . A limited number of proteins were recognised by IgG from all pools of patients . All of these latter proteins were also recognised by IgG from HCs . Interestingly , a - enolase was recognised by IgG from all pools of Figure 2 IgG reactivities directed toward triosephosphate isomerase , superoxide dismutase mitochondrial precursor and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L .

The areas delineated by rectangles in B ( pH 6 . 5 to 7 . 8 ; 22 to 28 kDa ) and D ( pH 7 . 1 to 7 . 7 ; 55 to 65 kDa ) correspond to the region of membranes magnified in A and D , respectively .

Finally , among the spots recog - nised by IgG from the 10 pools of sera from patients with unidentified ANAs , 15 were specifically recognised by IgG from at least 4 of these 10 pools in total or enriched nuclear protein extracts ( Table 3 ) Comparison of IgG reactivities in sera from HCs and SSc patients Serum IgG from the pool of 12 HCs recognised 95 ± 1 and 108 ± 3 protein spots in total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , respectively . In the total protein extract , IgG reactivity for triosephosphate isomerase ( TPI ) and superoxide dismutase mitochondrial precursor ( SOD2 ) was higher in the majority of pools of SSc patients , especially in those with sera from patients with uniden - tified ANAs , than in the pool of sera from HCs ( Figure 2 ) . Although IgG reactivity was slightly higher for SOD2 in sera from patients without visceral involvement , IgG reactivities did not differ between subgroups of patients for TPI or SOD2 . In the enriched nuclear protein extract , IgG reactivity for heterogeneous nuclear ribonu - cleoprotein L ( hnRNP L ) was high in several sera pools from SSc patients with unidentified ANAs and low in the pool of sera from HCs ( Figure 2 ) . In both total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , IgG reactivity for lamin A / C was high in several sera pools from patients with unidentified ANAs ( Figure 3 ) . Interestingly , no IgG reactivity for lamin A / C was observed in sera pools from HCs and from patients with identified ANAs or without ANAs . Finally , IgG reactivity for lamin A / C was high in the pool of sera from patients with lcSSc , digital ulcers and unidentified ANAs in both total and enriched nuclear protein extracts ( Figures 3A and 3D ) . Subset - specific IgG reactivities in sera from patients with unidentified ANAs Using both groups of experiments performed with total and enriched nuclear protein extracts , we identified IgG reactivities that were specific for each phenotypic subset of patients with unidentified ANAs . MS identified a number of key target antigens ( Table 4 ) . Interestingly , with the exception of one subset , we identified at least one and up to four target antigens recognised by sera pools from each subset of patients with unidentified ANAs , including cofilin 1 , peroxiredoxin 2 ( PRDX2 ) and calreticulin ( Table 4 ) . One target antigen , eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A - 1 , was identified in both the total and the enriched nuclear protein extracts from patients with the same disease subset . Biological network analysis of identified autoantibody specificities Lists of HEp - 2 cell proteins specifically recognised and / or recognised with high intensity by IgG from SSc patients were analysed by using Pathway Studio soft - ware . Interestingly , most of these proteins were involved in the transforming growth factor b ( TGF - b ) pathway ( Additional file 4 ) . From this network , we wanted to focus on molecules recognised by IgG from SSc patients with unidentified ANAs . This allowed us to depict the signalling network between TGF - b and HEp - 2 cell proteins identified as major targets of autoantibodies in SSc patients with unidentified ANAs ( Figure 4 ) . Thus , the expression of these proteins can be either increased or decreased by TGF - b . Interestingly , some of these proteins are involved in the pathophysiological process of SSc .

Bussone et al . Arthritis Research & Therapy 2011 , 13 : R74 http : / / arthritis - research . com / content / 13 / 3 / R74 Page 6 of 13 Discussion In the present work , we have identified a number of new target antigens for autoantibodies in SSc patients that are either shared among patients or specific to a given phe - notype . For some antigens , including TPI , SOD2 , hnRNP L and lamin A / C , IgG reactivity was higher in sera pools from patients than in pools from HCs . TPI , a glycolytic enzyme localised in the cytoplasm , is one of the nine pro - teins specifically identified in whole saliva from patients with dcSSc as compared with HCs [ 17 ] . Interestingly , we recently identified another glycolytic enzyme , a - enolase , as a target of antifibroblast antibodies in SSc patients , particularly those with ILD and / or ATAs [ 18 , 19 ] . SOD2 is a mitochondrial metalloenzyme that catalyses the dis - mutation of the superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen and protects against reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Thus , autoantibodies directed against SOD2 might impair the enzyme function and favour ROS accumulation . This finding could be relevant to the pathogenesis of SSc , because a major increase in ROS level is a hallmark of SSc [ 20 ] . Interestingly , Dalpke et al . [ 21 ] reported that a hyperimmune serum against SOD2 inhibited the protective effects of SOD2 on endothelial cells exposed to oxidative stress . In addition , downregula - tion of SOD2 expression was described in osteoarthritis [ 22 ] , and anti - TPI antibodies have been identified in several autoimmune conditions , including neuropsychia - tric systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) [ 23 ] , and in osteoarthritis [ 24 ] . Lamins A and C are both encoded by the LMNA gene and represent major constituents of the inner nuclear membrane . Mutations of this gene have been identified in a number of conditions , including Hutchinson - Gilford progeria syndrome [ 25 ] , which represents a Table 3 Proteins specifically recognised by IgG from at least four pools of patients with unidentified ANA Protein ID on gel HEp - 2 cell protein SwissProtaccessionnumber MWth / es pH i th / es Number of unique identified peptides # Totalionscore Best ion score Sequence coverage ( % ) 550 Far upstream element - binding protein 2 ( N ) [ SwissProt : FUBP2 _ HUMAN ] 73 / 80 6 . 8 / 7 . 1 10 / 17 554 108 37 553 Far upstream element - binding protein 2 ( N ) [ SwissProt : FUBP2 _ HUMAN ] 73 / 79 6 . 8 / 7 . 3 11 / 17 864 153 32 554 Far upstream element - binding protein 2 ( N ) [ SwissProt : FUBP2 _ HUMAN ] 73 / 79 6 . 8 / 7 . 5 10 / 17 598 105 34 617 Lamin A / C ( N ) [ SwissProt : LMNA _ HUMAN ] 74 / 73 6 . 6 / 7 . 0 11 / 29 680 127 50 762 RNA - binding protein FUS ( N ) [ SwissProt : FUS _ HUMAN ] 53 / 61 9 . 4 / 7 . 8 2 / 5 64 45 17 771 Ras GTPase - activating protein - binding protein 1 ( N ) [ SwissProt : G3BP1 _ HUMAN ] 52 / 61 5 . 4 / 6 . 0 5 / 12 381 131 39 913 Lamin A / C ( T ) [ SwissProt : LMNA _ HUMAN ] 74 / 77 6 . 6 / 7 . 0 5 / 14 120 39 28 914 Lamin A / C ( T ) [ SwissProt : LMNA _ HUMAN ] 74 / 77 6 . 6 / 6 . 8 7 / 23 121 38 42 921 RuvB - like 1 ( N ) [ SwissProt : RUVB1 _ HUMAN ] 50 / 50 6 . 0 / 6 . 8 8 / 16 591 131 50 Protein DEK ( N ) [ SwissProt : DEK _ HUMAN ] 43 / 50 8 . 7 / 6 . 8 2 / 4 162 92 12 924 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H ( N ) [ SwissProt : HNRH1 _ HUMAN ] 49 / 49 5 . 9 / 6 . 4 8 / 15 440 80 53 1132 60 - kDa heat shock protein , mitochondrial precursor ( T ) [ SwissProt : CH60 _ HUMAN ] 61 / 61 5 . 7 / 5 . 5 7 / 15 176 36 28 1191 Serine / threonine protein phosphatase PP1 - b catalytic subunit ( N ) [ SwissProt : PP1B _ HUMAN ] 37 / 34 5 . 8 / 6 . 1 2 / 10 62 41 35 1629 Annexin A1 ( T ) [ SwissProt : ANXA1 _ HUMAN ] 39 / 38 6 . 6 / 6 . 7 6 / 13 233 73 50 2212 Stathmin ( T ) [ SwissProt : STMN1 _ HUMAN ] 17 / 18 5 . 8 / 6 . 2 2 / 6 82 51 32 2039 Histone - binding protein RBBP4 ( N ) [ SwissProt : RBBP4 _ HUMAN ] 48 / 48 4 . 7 / 5 . 1 7 / 10 414 103 27 a ANA : antinuclear antibody ; FUS : fused in sarcoma ; MW : molecular weight ( in kilodaltons ) ; N : proteins recognised in HEp - 2 cell - enriched nuclear protein extract ; pH i , intracellular pH ; PP1 : protein phosphatase 1 ; SSc : systemic sclerosis ; T : proteins recognised in HEp - 2 cell total protein extract ; th / es : theoretical / estimated . b Number of uniquely identified peptides in tandem mass spectrometry ( MS / MS ) and mass spectrometry + MS / MS searches .

The most frequent mutation responsible for progeria creates a truncated progeria mutant lamin A ( progerin ) , which accumulates within the nuclei of human vascular cells and may be directly responsible for vascular involvement in progeria [ 26 ] . The identification of lamin as a major target of autoantibodies in SSc patients precludes the potential role of modified and / or dysfunctional lamin and / or antilamin autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of SSc . Antilamin antibodies were found in sera from patients with SLE [ 27 ] and antiphospholipid syndrome [ 28 ] as well as in a patient with linear morphea [ 29 ] . HnRNP L is a nuclear protein associated with hnRNP complexes and takes part in the processing of pre - mRNA . Anti - hnRNP L antibodies were identified in a small cohort of SSc patients in association with anti - hnRNP A / B anti - bodies [ 30 ] . HnRNP L was also identified as a target of autoantibodies in New Zealand White × BXSB mice with SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome [ 31 ] . Our analysis revealed that PRDX2 , cofilin 1 and calreti - culin were specifically recognised by IgG from phenotypic subsets of patients with unidentified ANAs . Other target antigens listed in Table 4 might also be rele - vant and should be tested in further work . PRDX2 is a peroxidase that eliminates endogenous ROS produced in response to growth factors such as platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) . PRDX2 influences oxidative and heat stress resistance [ 32 ] and inhibits PDGF signalling and vascular remodelling [ 33 ] . Interestingly , PRDX2 has recently been identified as a target of anti - endothelial cell antibodies in systemic vasculitis [ 34 ] . Cofilin 1 is a regulator of actin depolymerisation . Cofi - lin is a major effector of nicotinamide adenine dinucleo - tide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase 1 - mediated migration , and NADPH oxidase 1 plays a critical role in neointima formation by mediating vascular smooth muscle cell migration , proliferation and extracellular matrix produc - tion [ 35 ] . Moreover , regulation of the phosphorylation state of cofilin controls PDGF - induced migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells [ 36 ] . Anti - cofilin 1 antibodies have been detected in a few patients with rheumatoid arthritis , SLE or polymyositis and / or derma - tomyositis [ 37 ] . Calreticulin is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and an intracellular calcium - binding protein and thus is involved in signal transduction pathways . In apoptotic cells , calreticulin is translocated to the cell surface , con - ferring immunogenicity of cell death [ 38 ] . Calreticulin has been described as a potential cell surface receptor involved in cell penetration of anti - DNA antibodies in patients with SLE [ 39 ] . Anticalreticulin antibodies have been reported in patients with celiac disease and SLE [ 40 , 41 ] . Interestingly , we determined that several autoantigens recognised by IgG from SSc patients were involved in the TGF - b pathway . In the pathophysiology of SSc , fibroblast proliferation and accumulation of extracellular matrix result from uncontrolled activation of the TGF - b pathway and from excess synthesis of connective tissue growth factor , PDGF , proinflammatory cytokines and ROS [ 3 ] . Thus , increased expression and / or modified structure or fragmentation in the presence of ROS of a number of proteins involved in the TGF - b pathway could trigger specific immune responses in these patients . Casciola - Rosen et al . [ 42 ] reported on the sensitivity of scleroderma antigens to ROS - induced fragmentation in this setting , possibly through ischemia - reperfusion injury as the potential initiator of the auto - immune process in SSc . The combined use of 2 - DE and immunoblotting offers an interesting approach to identifying target antigens of autoantibodies [ 10 , 13 ] . We used HEp - 2 cells as sources of autoantigens because these cells are routinely used to detect ANAs . Although not directly relevant to the Figure 3 IgG reactivities directed toward lamin A / C .

Bussone et al .

Additional validation studies with sera from patients with other connective tissue diseases are necessary . In addition , 2 - DE and immunoblotting were not adapted to test a large number of sera , and thus further experiments using ELISA with recombinant proteins are necessary , which will allow for validation of the target antigens and screening of a large number of patients . However , our work has several additional limitations .

Therefore , a number of proteins were probably lost at each step of the technique , depending on their charge , molecular weight , subcellular localisation and / or abundance in the cell . Topoisomerase II is not detected by traditional methods of 2 - DE [ 43 ] , and we failed to identify topoisomerase I or centromeric protein B as target antigens of IgG autoanti - bodies , whereas these antigens are easily detected in 1 - D gels [ 6 , 44 , 45 ] . Anti - topoisomerase I and anti - RNA poly - merase III antibodies preferentially recognise a discontin - uous or conformational epitope that may not be detected in 2 - D gels [ 46 , 47 ] . As expected , none of the identified antigens was located at the cell surface , since protein extraction for 2 - DE does not allow the identification of membrane proteins . Conclusions We have identified new target autoantigens in SSc patients , a number of which are involved in the TGF - b pathway . Although these data must be confirmed by other groups and in large cohorts of patients with SSc or other connective tissue diseases , these new autoanti - body specificities could represent major advances in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with SSc .
