Like other gram - negative bacteria , the ability of P . gingivalis to produce outer membrane vesicles is a strategy used to interact with , and survive within its biological niches . Here we compared the protein components associated with vesicles derived from a ﬁmbriated strain ( 33277 ) and an aﬁmbriated strain ( W83 ) of P . gingivalis using proteomic analyses . Some well - known virulence factors were identiﬁed in vesicles from both strains , such as gingipains and hemagglutinin . In contrast , FimC , FimD , and FimE , minor components of long ﬁmbriae were found exclusively in 33277 vesicles , while proteins with a tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR ) domain were unique to W83 ves - icles . We found that signiﬁcantly more 33277 than W83 vesicles were internal - ized into human oral keratinocytes and gingival ﬁbroblasts . Interestingly , FimA , a well - known adhesin responsible for the attachment and invasion of P . gingiva - lis into host cells , was not essential for the invasive capabilities of P . gingivalis vesicles . Rather minor components of long ﬁmbriae were required for an efﬁ - cient invasive activity of vesicles . The most striking ﬁnding was that P . gingivalis strains lacking or having a reduced FimA expression showed a signiﬁcant reduction in vesiculation . These results suggest that production and pathogenic - ity of P . gingivalis vesicles may largely depend on expression of the ﬁm locus , and that the integration of vesicle production and pathogenicity with ﬁmbrial expression may allow P . gingivalis to confer upon itself certain functional advantages . Introduction Vesicles , generally produced by gram - negative bacteria , are found both on the surfaces of cells and in their sur - rounding environments ( MacDonald and Kuehn 2012 ) . Vesicles have also been isolated from bioﬁlms ( Schooling and Beveridge 2006 ; Toyofuku et al . 2012 ) . Recently , the prevalence of vesicles was found to be relatively abundant in coastal and open - ocean seawater at a level similar to the concentrations of bacteria at these sites , indicating that vesicles are produced not only by bioﬁlm - inhabiting microbes living at high cell density but also by planktonic bacteria in the open ocean ( Biller et al . 2014 ) . Bacterial vesicles appear to protect the bacteria from membrane active antibiotics by scavenging them or by acting as decoy to prevent phage attack ( Scanlan 2014 ) . These observations suggest that vesicles perform some speciﬁc functions related to bacterial survival in ecosystems . Although vesicles are released continuously in many gram - negative bacteria , the levels of vesiculation in ª 2014 The Authors . MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd .

Therefore , vesicle production may be one of the protective mechanisms utilized by bacteria in hos - tile environments . Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram - negative bacterium associated with chronic periodontitis . The organism has been observed to both express vesicles on their cell sur - face and release them to its environments ( Grenier and Mayrand 1987 ; Smalley and Birss 1987 ) . Consistent with vesicles of other gram - negative bacteria , P . gingivalis vesi - cles are between 50 and 250 nm in diameter but are predominantly around 50 nm . A recent study , using proteomics analyses , reported that protein proﬁles of P . gingivalis vesicles are similar with major outer mem - brane proteins such as FimA , HagA , and gingipains ( Kgp , RgpA , and RgpB ) ( Imai et al . 2005 ; Nakao et al . 2014 ) . This suggests that these vesicles may serve as a vehicle for some important virulence factors and proteolytic enzymes of P . gingivalis . Since they carry the major outer mem - brane proteins of P . gingivalis , the vesicles have shown the following characteristic features , such as induction of immune responses , coaggregation with other oral bacteria , and host cell invasion . For example , Nakao et al . ( 2014 ) reported that these vesicles were highly antigenic , as that absorption of patient sera with vesicles greatly reduced reactivity with whole cells of P . gingivalis . An invasive activity of P . gingivalis vesicles was also observed . It was reported that after exposure to HeLa and immortalized human gingival epithelial ( IHGE ) cells , intracellular P . gingivalis vesicles were detected within 15 min ( Furuta et al . 2009b ) . This process appears to be a FimA and gin - gipain dependent , since vesicles of the ﬁmA mutant and the rgp - null mutant showed a much lower interaction with host cells ( Furuta et al . 2009a , b ) . One of the most recognized features of P . gingivalis is its role as a keystone pathogen involved in modulating the virulence of the entire microbial community through interactive commu - nication with other oral pathogens ( Hajishengallis and Lamont 2012 ) . Previous studies demonstrated that P . gingivalis vesicles are able to enhance the attachment and invasion of Tannerella forsythia to epithelial cells , and mediate coaggregation between Treponema denticola and Lachnoanaerobaculum saburreum and between mycelium - type Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus ( Kamag - uchi et al . 2003 ; Inagaki et al . 2006 ; Grenier 2013 ) . There - fore , an in - depth understanding of vesicles with these distinct features is an important area of not only peri - odontitis research but also periodontitis - associated sys - temic diseases . In order to characterize P . gingivalis vesicles , we exam - ined vesicle production and invasive activity in wild - type strains of P . gingivalis W83 , 33277 , and their mutants . The results revealed a ﬁmbrial - mediated vesiculation in P . gingivalis . Using confocal microscopy and Fluores - cence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) , we measured and compared the invasive activities of these vesicles toward human oral keratinocytes ( HOKs ) and gingival ﬁbroblasts ( HGFs ) . We show in this study that minor components ( FimC , D , and E ) of long ﬁmbriae , but not FimA , and the adhesive domains of gingipains were involved in the invasive activity of the vesicles . The vesicles appeared to translocate across a monolayer of HOKs in a transwell system and invade HGFs in the lower compartment . These ﬁndings provide opportunities to identify pathways and mechanisms of vesicles formation and regulation in P . gingivalis . Experimental Procedures Bacterial strains and vesicle preparation Porphyromonas gingivalis strains were grown from frozen stocks in TSB ( trypticase soy broth ) or on TSB blood agar plates supplemented with yeast extract ( 1 mg / mL ) , hemin ( 5 l g / mL ) , and menadione ( 1 l g / mL ) , and incu - bated at 37 ° C in an anaerobic chamber ( 85 % N 2 , 10 % H 2 , 5 % CO 2 ) . Porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles were pre - pared as described previously ( Furuta et al . 2009b ) . Brieﬂy , P . gingivalis cells were grown to the late exponen - tial phase and growth media were collected by centrifuga - tion at 10 , 000 g for 15 min at 4 ° C and ﬁltered through a 0 . 22 - l m pore size ﬁlters ( Cell Treat , Shirley , MA ) to remove residual bacteria . Vesicles were collected by ultra - centrifugation at 126 , 000 g for 2 h at 4 ° C and resus - pended in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 10 % glycerol . Bacterial proteins were extracted from the vesicles using a BugBuster (cid:2) Protein Extraction Reagent ( EMD Biosciences , Madison , WI ) and protein concentra - tions were determined with a Protein Assay Kit ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Proteomics analysis of P . gingivalis vesicles Vesicles ( 8 . 3 l g ) were separated by a short - stack ( ~ 1 cm ) SDS - PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue . Protein bands were excised from the gels and in - gel digested with trypsin ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . Liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) was performed with the tryptic peptide samples separated over a 90 - min gradient run on a C18 nanocolumn ( Phe - nomenex , Torrance , CA ) coupled in - line with a LTQ lin - ear ion trap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) . The tandem MS / MS spectra were analyzed using Myrimatch Proteomics software against UniProt protein databases for both P . gingivalis 33277 54 ª 2014 The Authors .

Peptide mass tolerance was set at (cid:1) 2 Da , and fragment mass tolerance was set at (cid:1) 1 Da . The parameters for database search were as fol - lows : semitryptic digestion ; up to two missed cleavage sites ; cysteine carbamidomethylation ( + 57 Da ) as a ﬁxed modiﬁcation and methionine oxidation ( + 16 Da ) as a variable modiﬁcation . The search results were ﬁltered to include only proteins with two or more unique peptide spectra and a protein false discovery rate ( FDR ) of < 5 % . The relative differences in protein abundance were esti - mated by spectral counting approach and statistically ana - lyzed using Fisher’s exact test with a statistical signiﬁcance threshold set at a Benjamini – Hochberg cor - rected P < 0 . 05 . Western blot analysis Surface extracts were extracted by sonication of P . gingi - valis strains grown in TSB for 16 h at 4 ° C . Surface extracts and vesicles of P . gingivalis ( 0 . 5 l g ) were sepa - rated by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and transferred to nitrocellu - lose membranes ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) with a Mini Transblot Electrophoretic transfer cell ( Bio - Rad ) at 100 V for 1 h . The membrane was treated with blocking solu - tion ( 3 % BSA in PBS ) for 1 h and incubated with poly - clonal anti - FimA or anti - HGP44 ( a C - terminal adhesin domain of gingipains ) antibodies diluted 1 : 1 , 000 for 1 h . After washing with PBS , the membrane was incubated with anti - rabbit horseradish peroxidase – conjugated sec - ondary antibodies for 1 h . The proteins were visualized using an Enhanced Chemiluminescence ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences Corp , Pittsburgh , PA ) and measured using a semiquantitative western blot technique with ImageJ soft - ware ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) . Treatment of host cells with P . gingivalis vesicles HGF and HOK cells were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories and cultured in speciﬁc media , according to the manufacturer’s instruction . To infect HGFs with P . gingivalis vesicles , HGFs ( 1 9 10 4 or 1 . 6 9 10 5 ) were grown overnight in poly - L - lysine coated 35 mm glass bottom dishes ( MatTek Corporation , Ash - land , MA ) or in six - well plates ( Corning Incorporated , Corning , NY ) , and P . gingivalis vesicles ( 500 ng ) were then added to the HGF cultures and incubated for 30 min . After removal of the unbound vesicles , HGFs were cul - tured for another 0 , 0 . 5 , 3 . 5 , and 23 . 5 h , respectively , with fresh media at 37 ° C , 5 % CO 2 . The cytotoxicity of vesicle treatment was determined with a Pierce LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Flow cytometry analysis After being infected with P . gingivalis vesicles , HGFs or HOKs were dissociated with trypsin , ﬁxed with 3 . 8 % form - aldehyde solution , and permeabilized with a solution con - taining 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 and 0 . 2 % BSA in PBS . The cells were then labeled with pan - speciﬁc antibodies of P . gingivalis and Alexa Fluor 546 donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were then examined on a BD FACSCalibur ﬂow cy - tometer , and the data were analyzed with FlowJo software . Confocal microscopy HGFs were grown overnight in poly - L - lysine coated 35 mm glass bottom dishes , and infected with P . gingivalis vesicle . After ﬁxing with 3 . 8 % formaldehyde in a sodium phos - phate buffer at room temperature for 10 min , HGFs were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min , and blocked with 5 % bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h . HGFs were then immunostained with pan - speciﬁc antibod - ies of P . gingivalis and followed by goat anti - rabbit IgG conjugated to Alex Fluor 546 ( Invitrogen ) . Confocal images were acquired using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope , NIKON CORPORATION , Tokyo , Japan . Transmission electron microscopy of P . gingivalis vesicles Transmission electron microscopy of P . gingivalis vesicles was conducted as described previously ( Chaudhuri S , et al . 2014 ) . Porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles ( 0 . 5 ng ) were suspended in 25 l L ddH 2 O and applied to a Form - var - coated copper grid ( 200 mesh , Electron microscopy Sciences , Hatﬁeld , PA ) for 1 min and were air - dried . The bacterial cells were then negatively stained with 0 . 5 % ammonium molybdate for 60 sec , and observed under a FEI Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope ( Philips , Hillsboro , OR , USA ) operated at 100 kV . Penetration of vesicles through HOK layers HOKs ( 1 9 10 6 ) were seeded onto 3 - l m pore size poly - ethylene terephthalate ( PET ) transwell inserts ( Falcon ; BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) and were allowed to settle for 3 h at 37 ° C under a 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . The transwell inserts were then placed in a six - well plate ( Cell Treat ) with fresh Oral Keratinocyte Medium and incubated for 8 days in order to obtain a polarized cell layer . When con - ﬂuent , cell monolayer integrity was measured using a Luci - fer Yellow CH kit ( Invitrogen ) . The transwells were removed from their respective wells and placed into wells of a six - well plate covered with HGFs with HGF growth medium . ª 2014 The Authors .

Characterization of P . gingivalis Vesicles Porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles that translocated through the monolayered HOKs were collected by centrifu - gation and resuspended in 50 l L ddH 2 O . Vesicles were quantitated with modiﬁcations using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) as described previously ( Chaudhuri et al . 2014 ) . Brieﬂy , Nunc - immuno modules ( Nalgene , San Diego , CA , USA ) were coated with vesicle proteins ( 50 l L ) for 16 h at 4 ° C . The modules were blocked with 3 % BSA in PBS – Tween - 20 . A series of dilu - tions of pan - 33277 polyclonal antibodies were then applied to the modules , and incubated for 3 h . After a wash , the modules were incubated with horseradish peroxidase – con - jugated antibodies against rabbit IgG ( 1 : 3 , 000 ; Amersham Biosciences , Waltham , MA , USA ) and peroxide substrate ( Sigma ) was added to each module . Results were read at 450 nm on a Benchmark Plus microplate reader ( Bio - Rad ) . All samples were assayed in triplicate for each sample . RNA isolation and qPCR Porphyromonas gingivalis strains were grown to reach an OD 595 = 1 . 0 and then harvested by centrifugation and homogenized in Trizol Reagent ( Invitrogen ) . The RNA in the supernatant was then puriﬁed using an RNeasy mini spin column ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . Real - time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) analysis was performed by using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT - PCR Kit ( Qiagen ) on the iCycler MyiQ TM Real - Time PCR detection system ( Bio - Rad ) according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . Primers are listed in Table S1 . The expression levels of the investigated genes for the test samples were determined relative to the untreated calibra - tor sample by using the comparative cycle threshold ( D C T ) method . The D C T were calculated by subtracting the average C T value of the test sample from the average C T value of the calibrator sample , and were then used to calculate the ratio between the two by assuming 100 % ampliﬁcation efﬁciency ( Xie and Zheng 2012 ) . Statistical analyses A Student’s t - test was used to determine statistical signiﬁ - cance of the differences in gene expression proﬁles and production and invasion of vesicles . A P < 0 . 05 was con - sidered signiﬁcant . Values are shown (cid:1) SD . Results FimA is required for vesiculation in P . gingivalis Levels of vesicle production were determined in P . gingi - valis strains including wild types 33277 , its ﬁmA mutant ( FAE ) and ﬁmR mutant ( FRE ) as well as wild - type W83 . The W83 , FAE , and FRE strains are known as aﬁmbriated strains based on their extremely low expression of long ﬁmbriae ( major ﬁmbriae ) ( Hayashi et al . 2000 ; Nishikawa and Duncan 2010 ; Wu and Xie 2010 ; Zheng et al . 2011 ) . Porphyromonas gingivalis FAE carries an insertional muta - tion in the ﬁmA gene encoding a major subunit protein of long ﬁmbriae , while FRE carries a mutation in the ﬁmR gene that encodes a response regulator , a member of two component signal transduction system involved in expression of ﬁm locus ( Hayashi et al . 2000 ) . W83 also lacks ﬁmbrial expression , likely due to a malfunctional FimS , a histidine kinase which acts as a transcriptional activator of ﬁm locus ( Nishikawa and Duncan 2010 ) . Ves - icles were collected from the growth media , and the pro - tein concentration of each vesicle suspension was measured . As shown in Figure 1A , although vesicles were detected in the growth media of all four strains , vesicle production in the three aﬁmbriated strains were signiﬁ - cantly lower ( ranged from 4 - to 10 - fold ) than that found in 33277 growth media , suggesting that the ﬁmbriated strain may produce more vesicles than the aﬁmbriated strains under standard culture conditions . To rule out the possibility that vesicles from W83 , FAE , and FRE have a lower protein content , electron microscopy was per - formed to ensure that vesicle suspension with 0 . 5 ng of protein concentration derived from each strain contained a similar number of vesicles . The number of vesicles was determined by counting 10 random areas ( 5 . 6 9 5 . 6 l m ) , and no signiﬁcant differences in numbers of vesicle suspensions were found among vesicle suspen - sions ( Fig . 1B ) . These data demonstrate a positive correla - tion between the expression level of FimA and the efﬁciency of vesicle production in P . gingivalis . We then examined the levels of FimA and gingipains , two well - known virulence factors of P . gingivalis , in 0 . 5 l g of vesicles and compared them with those found in surface extracts ( 0 . 5 l g ) of the original bacterial cells using western blot analysis with anti - FimA and anti - Hgp44 ( a binding domain of gingipains ) sera as probes . As expected , FimA protein was only detected in P . gingi - valis 33277 and in its vesicles , but not in W83 surface extracts or its vesicles , or in vesicles from the ﬁmA and ﬁmR mutants ( FAE and FRE ) ( Fig . 2A ) . In contrast , a C - terminal adhesive domain of gingipains ( Hgp44 ) was identiﬁed in both 33277 and W83 surface extracts as well as in the vesicles of 33277 , FAE , FRE , and W83 . The pro - tein bands were quantitated using image processing soft - ware ( ImageJ ) . As shown in Figure 2B , the Hgp44 domain was evidently enriched in the vesicles of all four strains when compared to the level found in surface extracts of 33277 and W83 . An approximately threefold increase in Hgp44 levels was observed in 33277 vesicles 56 ª 2014 The Authors . MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . Characterization of P . gingivalis Vesicles C . K . Mantri et al . compared to the level in surface extracts of the originat - ing cells , and a ﬁvefold increase in Hgp44 in W83 vesicles ( Fig . 2B ) . In contrast , a 20 % reduction was detected in FimA level in 33277 vesicles , compared to the levels in surface extracts of 33277 cells ( Fig . 2C ) . These data imply that vesicles production and assembly are regulated in P . gingivalis . Comparison of protein proﬁles of vesicles from P . gingivalis 33277 and W83 To systematically identify the protein components of P . gingivalis vesicles , we tested protein cargo selection in vesicles by comparing the protein compositions of vesicles isolated from P . gingivalis 33277 and W83 , whose * * * 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 33277 W83 FAE FRE R e l a ti v e p r o t e i n c on ce n t r a ti on P . gingivalis vesicles ( A ) ( B ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 33277 W83 FAE FRE R e l a ti v e nu m b e r o f v e s i c l e Vesicles Figure 1 .

MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . 57 C . K . Mantri et al . Characterization of P . gingivalis Vesicles genomes have been sequenced , using LC - MS / MS analyses . A total of 67 proteins were identiﬁed in 33277 vesicles ( Table S2 ) with at least two or more unique peptide hits , and 70 identiﬁed in W83 vesicles ( Table S3 ) . Among the identiﬁed proteins , 12 proteins were unique to 33277 , and included the minor components of major ﬁmbriae , FimC , D , and E ( Table 1 ) . Twenty - three proteins were only found in W83 , and included a PorT protein and several proteins with a tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR ) domain . Consistent with the results of western blot analyses , gingi - pains were a major component of vesicles from both P . gingivalis strains based on the number of peptide spectral counts observed ( Table 2 ) . FimA ( major component of long ﬁmbriae ) and Mfa1 ( major component of short ﬁmbriae ) were abundant in 33277 vesicles , but were sparse in W83 vesicles . Our results revealed differential protein proﬁles in vesicles from wild - type strains 33277 and W83 . Minor components of long ﬁmbriae are associated with invasive activity of P . gingivalis vesicles Adhesive proteins hemagglutinin A ( HagA ) , FimA , and gingipains ( RgpA and Kgp ) are reportedly involved in P . gingivalis attachment to , and invasion of , host cells ( Yilmaz et al . 2002 ; Chen and Duncan 2004 ; Zhang et al . 2011 ; Belanger et al . 2012 ) . We speculated , therefore , that P . gingivalis 33277 vesicles , containing all these proteins , would be able to invade HGF with a signiﬁcantly higher efﬁciency than W83 or the ﬁmA mutant . To test the inva - sive activity of P . gingivalis vesicles , HGFs were exposed to vesicles isolated from 33277 , FAE , and W83 , and the inter - nalization of vesicles was observed under a confocal micro - scope . Not surprisingly , vesicles of all three strains were found to invade HGFs , but at different efﬁciencies ( Fig . 3A ) . After exposure to HGFs for 30 min , most of the 33277 vesicles were internalized . We found that while the majority of vesicles from FAE or W83 appeared to be attached to the surfaces of HGFs at 30 min after exposure , only FAE vesicles were internalized by 4 h to the same degree as 33277 vesicles . In contrast at 4 h , far fewer W83 vesicles were observed inside HGFs than 33277 vesicles . These ﬁndings indicate different invasive capabilities in terms of rates of internalization , among the three strains . Observation of the internalized vesicles of 33277 for a 24 h duration revealed that the vesicles invaded HGFs by 15 min and then translocated toward the nuclei at the 4 h time point ( Fig . 3B ) . These results are in agreement with an earlier report by Furuta et al . ( 2009b ) who demon - strated a sorting process of the internalized vesicles of P . gingivalis from early endosomes to lysosomes in HGFs over 24 h . Detachment of HGFs from the poly - L - lysine – coated glass bottom dishes was not observed , and HGFs carrying internalized vesicles remained viable for 24 h after initial exposure under our experimental conditions ( Fig . 3B ) . HGFs with internalized vesicles were quantitated using a ﬂow cytometry assay . Four hours after initial exposure to P . gingivalis vesicles , 40 % of HGFs were sorted with vesicles from P . gingivalis 33277 , while only 2 % of cells had W83 vesicles ( Fig . 4A and B ) . Consistent with this confocal microscopy observation , there was no signiﬁcant difference in the invasion rates of vesicles isolated from 33277 and its ﬁmA mutant , which is not in agreement with a previous study that reported a FimA - dependent entry of human gingival epithelial cells ( Furuta et al . 2009b ) . Thus , we speculated that the minor components of ﬁmbriae , such as FimC , FimD , and / or FimE , are involved in vesicle invasion , since these proteins are known to play a critical role in the adhesive activities of the mature FimA ﬁmbriae in P . gingivalis ( Nishiyama et al . 2007 ) and are exclusively found in 33277 vesicles Table 1 .

The expression of the ﬁmC , ﬁmD , and ﬁmE genes in the ﬁmR mutant was drastically repressed com - pared to that of its parent strain ( Fig . 5 ) . In contrast , there was no signiﬁcant difference in expression levels of these genes in 33277 and the ﬁmA mutant , which is con - sistent with earlier observations showing that the ﬁmA gene is monocistronic ( Dickinson et al . 1988 ; Amano et al . 1994 ) . The ﬁndings also indicate that there was no polar effect of the mutation in ﬁmA on its downstream genes ( ﬁmC , ﬁmD , and ﬁmE ) . Expression of these genes was not detectible in P . gingivalis W83 . Therefore , a com - parison of the expression levels of ﬁmC , ﬁmD , and ﬁmE in P . gingivalis strains and their respective vesicle invasive capabilities implicates the minor components of long ﬁmbriae as having a role in vesicle entry into HGFs . Invasion and translocation of monolayered HOKs by P . gingivalis vesicles To determine if P . gingivalis vesicles can translocate through HOK layers , two - dimensional ( monolayer ) HOKs cultures in transwell inserts were exposed to vesicles . We found that HOKs stayed stable during the period of 10 days , and assay conditions were noncytotoxic as deter - mined by a Pierce LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit ( data not shown ) . Thus permeability of the two - dimensional ( monolayer ) HOKs cultures was smaller than 1 % , after 8 days in culture ( data not shown ) . The uptake of vesicles by HOKs was visualized using a confocal microscopy after a 24 h treatment of vesicles , followed by culturing of the HOKs carrying vesicles for another 24 h in a glass - bottomed dish . In agreement with a previous report ( Furuta et al . 2009b ) , 33277 vesi - cles were internalized in HOKs and remained in the cytoplasm for 48 h without a signiﬁcant impairment of the host cells ( Fig . 6A ) . Similar to that observed in HGFs , internalization of W83 and FRE vesicles into HOKs was much less than that seen with 33277 and FAE vesicles . Interestingly , vesicles derived from 33277 and FAE appeared to aggregate and form bigger clusters once inside HOKs . This phenomenon likely resulted from the expression of the minor components of ﬁmb - riae , since autoaggregation activities were reduced in the ﬁmC , ﬁmD , and ﬁmE mutants which lacked these minor components of the ﬁmbriae , rather than the loss of ﬁmbriae themselves ( Nishiyama et al . 2007 ) . FACS was used to quantitate the number of HOKs with internal - ized vesicles after vesicles translocated through the HOK monolayer . More HOKs were internalized with 33277 Table 2 .

MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . 59 C . K . Mantri et al . Characterization of P . gingivalis Vesicles and FAE vesicles than with FRE and W83 vesicles ( Fig . 6B ) . We then examined translocation of P . gingivalis vesicles through two - dimensional HOK cultures . Vesicles were added to the transwells sealed with HOKs , and growth media in the lower compartments were collected by cen - trifugation 24 h after initial inoculation and quantitated using ELISA . A 40 – 50 % decrease in translocation was found in vesicles derived from W83 and FAE compared to 33277 vesicles ( Fig . 7A ) . Translocation rates were simi - lar for 33277 and of FRE vesicles . This was not surprising , as given the lower invasive activity of FRE vesicles into HOKs , there should be more intercellular vesicles in the monolayer of HOKs . W83 vesicles had the lowest translo - cation activity among the tested vesicles , when their inva - sive activity into HOKs in the transwell inserts was taken into consideration . When invasive activities of vesicles translocated through the HOK monolayer were examined , we found 50 % fewer positive HGFs with internalized FAE vesicles compared to the HGFs with internalized 33277 vesicles ( Fig . 7B ) . We postulated , therefore , that this reduction is likely due to the decreased ability of FAE ves - icles to translocate through a HOK monolayer . Discussion In this study , we compared the protein proﬁles of vesicles from two P . gingivalis strains , 33277 ( ﬁmbriated ) and W83 ( aﬁmbriated ) . Most well - known major outer mem - brane proteins of P . gingivalis ( Imai et al . 2005 ) were found to be among the major components of these vesicles .

MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . Characterization of P . gingivalis Vesicles C . K . Mantri et al . among the top ranked proteins of 33277 and W83 vesi - cles . Therefore , we speculated that P . gingivalis vesicles function as an extension of the bacterial outer membrane , and are involved in interactions between the organism and its environment . Major subunit proteins ( FimA and Mfa1 ) of long and short ﬁmbriae were abundant compo - nents of 33277 but not W83 vesicles , which is consistent with two recent proteomic studies using either 33277 or W83 vesicles alone ( Nakao et al . 2014 ; Veith et al . 2014 ) . It is worthy to note that several TPR such as PG1385 ( TprA ) , PG1028 , PG1651 , and PG0449 were exclusively found in W83 ( Table 1 ) . TPR - containing proteins are known to be directly involved in bacterial virulence , such as the translocation of virulence factors into host cells , and adhesion to host cells ( Edqvist et al . 2006 ; Chakr - aborty et al . 2008 ) . Previous studies , using the mouse subcutaneous infection model , showed that expression of W83 TrpA was upregulated in a mouse subcutaneous chamber , and that the survival rates of mice infected with the tprA mutant were signiﬁcantly higher than those of mice infected with the parent strain W83 , suggesting a role of TrpA in P . gingivalis virulence ( Yoshimura et al . 2008 ; Kondo et al . 2010 ) although the mechanism remains to be clariﬁed . Our study also revealed an enrich - ment of HGP44 ( an adhesive domain of gingipains ) in vesicles . These enriched or excluded proteins in P . gingi - valis vesicles support the notion of bacterial vesicles con - taining selected cargo . Based on a recent report , P . gingivalis 33277 vesicles ( 5 – 10 l g / mL ) caused a detach - ment of cultured oral epithelial cells , and the detachment activity of the vesicles was gingipain dependent ( Nakao et al . 2014 ) . Although the detachment of HGFs or HOKs was not observed with a protein concentration of vesicles ( 0 . 5 l g / mL ) , we found a detachment effect when HGFs were exposed to a higher protein concentration of vesicles ( > 3 l g / mL ) from both 33277 and W83 ( data not shown ) . Therefore , it is conceivable that production of P . gingiva - lis vesicles may be a major mechanism for release and delivery of gingipains into periodontal tissues . Examination of vesicle production revealed a differen - tial formation and release in P . gingivalis strains . A higher level of vesiculation was found in the growth media of 33277 when compared to W83 media .

MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . 61 C . K . Mantri et al . Characterization of P . gingivalis Vesicles mutant and the ﬁmR mutant , also produced signiﬁcantly fewer vesicles than its parent strain 33277 . A recent study by Kerr et al . ( 2014 ) using transmission electron micros - copy , showed a copious number of outer membrane vesi - cles on the surfaces of many P . gingivalis strains including 33277 , while a few vesicles were observed on the surface of W83 . Although these authors and our laboratory examined vesicle production at different sites ( in the growth media vs . on the surface of bacterial cells ) , the parallel results suggest that FimA production or its regulatory system is likely involved in vesicle biogenesis in P . gingivalis . Interestingly , requirement of the synthesis of ﬂagella proteins for vesicle production was recently found in E . coli W3110 ( Manabe et al . 2013 ) . In fact , the dele - tion or overexpression of several membrane - associated proteins were known to affect vesiculation in many gram - negative bacteria , which likely results from an alteration of envelope structure and / or decreased membrane stabil - ity ( Baker et al . 2014 ) . One of important features of P . gingivalis is its ability to invade and survive within host cells ( Tribble and Lamont 2010 ) . In this study , we demonstrated that P . gingivalis vesicles invaded both HGFs and HOKs .

MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd . Characterization of P . gingivalis Vesicles C . K . Mantri et al . ever , the invasive activities varied between vesicles derived from 33277 and W83 , which is consistent with the inva - sive activities observed in their originating cells ( Wayak - anon et al . 2013 ) . Since FimA was far more abundant in 33277 vesicles than in W83 vesicles , we speculated that a decreased invasive activity would be found in vesicles from the ﬁmA mutant , as we showed previously that the ﬁmA mutant lost 90 % of its invasive activity into HGFs ( Chaudhuri et al . 2014 ) . Surprisingly , vesicles from this mutant showed a similar invasive activity as 33277 , while vesicles from the ﬁmR mutant showed a signiﬁcantly decreased invasive activity , due to reduced expression of the ﬁm locus that encodes minor components ( FimC , FimD , and FimE ) of long ﬁmbriae . These ﬁndings are consistent with a previous report that ﬁmbriae puriﬁed from the ﬁmC , ﬁmD , and ﬁmE mutants showed reduced binding activities to Streptococcus oralis and to ﬁbronectin and type I collagen , suggesting that these minor compo - nents of ﬁmbriae play critical roles in their adhesive activ - ities ( Nishiyama et al . 2007 ) . We note that minor components of bacterial ﬁmbriae are generally considered to act as adhesins or are responsible for ﬁmbrial assembly . In the case of vesicles , the minor components are more likely to be adhesins , since mature ﬁmbrial structures were not observed on the surfaces of vesicles isolated from all P . gingivalis strains tested . Bacterial vesicles , based on their small size and their adhesive and proteolytic activities , are known to spread more readily in tissues than in bacterial cells ( Kuehn and Kesty 2005 ) . Porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles were shown in this study to penetrate through a monolayer of HOKs and then invade HGFs . According to the current state of knowledge , P . gingivalis cells spread in periodontal tissues via intercellular translocation established by actin - depen - dent membrane protrusions or through intercellular junc - tions , which require gingipain activity ( Andrian et al . 2004 ; Yilmaz et al . 2006 ) . Takeuchi et al . ( 2011 ) also showed an epithelial translocation of P . gingivalis cells that was medi - ated by an endocytotic recycling pathway . Although P . gin - givalis vesicles were able to enter human epithelial cells by an endocytic pathway and were sorted to lysosomal com - partments ( Furuta et al . 2009b ) , there was no evidence of the vesicles trafﬁcking out the cells through recycling endo - somes . We observed that considerable amount of P . gingi - valis vesicles remained within HOKs 48 h after the initial invasion , and that vesicles of the ﬁmR mutant ( with a lim - ited invasive activity ) were also able to penetrate the mono - layer of HOKs at a similar level as 33277 vesicles . Therefore , spreading of P . gingivalis vesicles is in part through an intercellular transport mechanism . In summary , the observations reported here provide evidence of a differential production , protein assembly , and invasive activity of vesicles derived from ﬁmbriated and aﬁmbriated strains of P . gingivalis . This work suggests that there is an opportunity to reduce P . gingivalis viru - lence and vesiculation via regulating its ﬁmbrial expres - sion and to also identify distinctive vesicles which may be modulated and utilized as a much safer vaccine than their parent bacterial cells .
