One hundred years have passed since the death of ¬¥Elie Metchnikoff ( 1845 ‚Äì 1916 ) . He was the first to observe the uptake of particles by cells and realized the importance of this process for the host response to injury and infection . He also was a strong advocate of the role of phagocytosis in cellular immunity , and with this he gave us the basis for our modern understanding of inflammation and the innate and acquired immune responses . Phagocytosis is an elegant but complex process for the ingestion and elimination of pathogens , but it is also important for the elimination of apoptotic cells and hence fundamental for tissue homeostasis . Phagocytosis can be divided into four main steps : ( i ) recognition of the target particle , ( ii ) signaling to activate the internalization machinery , ( iii ) phagosome formation , and ( iv ) phagolysosome maturation . In recent years , the use of new tools of molecular biology and microscopy has provided new insights into the cellular mechanisms of phagocytosis . In this review , we present a general view of our current knowledge on phagocytosis . We emphasize novel molecular findings , particularly on phagosome formation and maturation , and discuss aspects that remain incompletely understood . 1 . Introduction ¬¥Elie Metchnikoff ( 1845 ‚Äì 1916 ) made his original observations in the 1880s while studying invertebrate marine organisms . He found special cells attacking small thorns placed into starfish larvae . Based on these findings , he later moved into immunology and championed the concept of cellular immu - nity . For his contributions he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1908 [ 1 ] . He shared the prize with Paul Ehrlich , a supporter of humoral immunity . Together they provided the bases for modern immunology . Phagocytosis is an important process for nutrition in unicellular organisms , while in multicellular organisms it is found in specialized cells called phagocytes . Phagocytosis consists in recognition and ingestion of particles larger than 0 . 5 ùúá m into a plasma membrane derived vesicle , known as phagosome . Phagocytes can ingest microbial pathogens , but importantly also apoptotic cells . In this way , they contribute to the clearance of billions of cells that are turned over every day . Thus phagocytosis becomes essential not only for micro - bial elimination , but also for tissue homeostasis . Profes - sional phagocytes [ 2 ] include monocytes , macrophages , neu - trophils , dendritic cells , osteoclasts , and eosinophils . These cells are in charge of eliminating microorganisms and of pre - senting them to cells of the adaptive immune system . In addi - tion , fibroblasts , epithelial cells , and endothelial cells can also perform phagocytosis . These nonprofessional phagocytes cannot ingest microorganisms but are important in eliminat - ing apoptotic bodies [ 3 , 4 ] . Phagocytes must recognize a large number of different particles that could potentially be ingested , including all sorts of pathogens and also apoptotic cells . This recognition is achieved thanks to a variety of discrete receptors that dis - tinguish the particle as a target and then initiate a signaling cascade that promotes phagocytosis . Receptors on the plasma membrane of phagocytes can be divided into nonopsonic or opsonic receptors . Nonopsonic receptors can recognize directly molecular groups on the surface of the phagocytic HindawiBioMed Research International Volume 2017 , Article ID 9042851 , 18 pages https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1155 / 2017 / 9042851 2 BioMed Research International targets . Among these receptors there are lectin - like recog - nition molecules , such as CD169 and CD33 ; also related C - type lectins , such as Dectin - 2 , Mincle , or DNGR - 1 ; scavenger receptors [ 5 ] ; and Dectin - 1 , which is a receptor for fungal beta - glucan [ 6 ] . Other receptors , such as SR - A or CD36 , can recognize both apoptotic and microbial polyanionic ligands , but their signaling capacity is not well described [ 5 ] . Interest - ingly , toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) [ 7 ] are detectors for foreign particles , but they do not function as phagocytic receptors . However , TLRs often collaborate with other nonopsonic receptors to stimulate ingestion [ 8 ] . Opsonic receptors recognize host - derived opsonins that bind to foreign particles and target them for ingestion . Opsonins include antibodies , complement , fibronectin , man - nose - binding lectin , and milk fat globulin ( lactadherin ) [ 3 ] . The best characterized and maybe most important opsonic phagocytic receptors are the Fc receptors ( FcR ) and the com - plement receptors ( CR ) . FcRs bind to the constant ( Fc por - tion ) of immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G [ 9 , 10 ] or IgA antibodies [ 11 ] . Complement receptors , such as CR3 , bind to iC3b deposited on the particle after complement activation [ 12 ] . After recognition of the target particle , phagocytic recep - tors initiate signaling cascades that remodel lipids in the cell membrane and regulate the actin cytoskeleton in order to extend the cell membrane around the particle [ 13 ] . During this part of the process , phagocytic receptors also engage in a sequential order and cooperate to complete the formation of the phagosome [ 14 ] . Once the particle is internalized inside the early phago - some , this vacuole can fuse with vesicles coming from the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex to form an intermediary phagosome [ 15 ‚Äì 21 ] . The contribution of the endoplasmic reticulum to phagosome formation and matura - tion is not completely understood , particularly in relation to cross - presentation of antigens . This is the process by which MHC class I ( MHC - I ) molecules can also present peptides from extracellular proteins . MHC - I molecules are delivered to the phagosome , where they are loaded with peptide and then recycled back to the plasma membrane . At present , it is not possible to convincingly describe a trafficking pathway for MHC - I molecules leading to cross - presentation . While classic ( endogenous ) MHC - I loading is basically restricted to the secretory pathway , cross - presentation involves interac - tion between this pathway and the phagocytic pathway [ 22 ] . A complete discussion of cross - presentation is beyond the scope of the present review . The reader is directed to recent excellent reviews on this topic [ 23 , 24 ] . Similarly , the contri - bution of the Golgi complex to phagosome formation is a matter of debate . Despite the fact that a role for the Golgi complex during phagocytosis by macrophages has been ruled out consensually by several groups [ 25 ‚Äì 27 ] , it is important to notice that these reports are mainly focused on Fc ùõæ receptor - mediated phagocytosis . In contrast , it was recently reported that recruitment of Golgi - derived secretory vesicles during phagosome formation was important for uptake of most particles , except IgG - opsonized ones [ 20 ] . The formation of an intermediary phagosome is dynamic process involving fusion of endocytic vesicles and fission of secretory vesicles , resulting in remodeling of the membrane and progressive acidification of the phagosome [ 28 ] . Later this intermediary phagosome turns into a microbicidal vacuole , the phagolyso - some , by fusing with lysosomes and changing its mem - brane and interior characteristics through a process named phagolysosome maturation [ 28 ] . 2 . Particle Recognition The first step in phagocytosis is the detection of the particle by phagocytes . This , as mentioned before , is accomplished by specialized receptors on the cell membrane . Foreign particles , such as microbial pathogens , can be recognized directly by receptors that bind molecules not found in higher organisms , or indirectly through opsonins . Several receptor types are found on a single phagocyte and they cooperate for recog - nition and ingestion of the particle . Some receptors can bind to pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) but not necessarily initiate phagocytosis . TLRs and some G - protein coupled receptors prepare ( prime ) the cell for phagocytosis by inducing inside - out activation of phagocytic integrins . 2 . 1 . Receptors for Foreign Particles 2 . 1 . 1 . Pattern - Recognition Receptors . Some receptors that directly bind PAMPs and seem to be phagocytic receptors include Dectin - 1 , mannose receptors , CD14 , and scavenger receptor A ( SR - A ) ( Table 1 ) . Dectin - 1 binds to polysaccharides of some yeast cells [ 29 ] . Mannose receptors bind mannan [ 30 ] . CD14 binds to lipopolysaccharide - binding protein [ 31 ] . SR - A can detect lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) on some gram - negative bacteria [ 32 ] and on Neisseria meningitidis [ 33 ] . Among these receptors , Dectin - 1 has been clearly shown to be sufficient for activating phagocytosis . When it is expressed on heterologous cells that normally cannot perform phagocyto - sis , it gives the cells phagocytic capabilities [ 29 , 34 ] . However , for other PAMP receptors the phagocytic potential is still a matter of debate . It may be that they induce phagocytosis indirectly by tethering the particle to the phagocyte surface , or by priming the phagocyte [ 35 ] to ingest the particle via other receptors . 2 . 1 . 2 . Opsonic Receptors . Foreign particles can also be recog - nized by phagocytes through soluble molecules that will bind to the particles , tagging them for ingestion . Once on the sur - face of the target particle , these molecules , called opsonins , are in turn recognized by specific receptors on the membrane of phagocytes . In this manner , opsonins function as a bridge between the phagocyte and the particle to be ingested . Antibody ( IgG ) molecules and complement components are important opsonins that induce efficient phagocytosis , and their receptors have been studied extensively ( Table 1 ) . Fc ùõæ receptors ( Fc ùõæ R ) are a family of glycoproteins expressed on the membrane of leukocytes , capable of binding the Fc portion of IgG molecules [ 10 , 36 ] . These receptors can bind to the various IgG subclasses with different affinities [ 9 ] and when crosslinked by multivalent antigen - antibody complexes can induce phagocytosis and other cellular responses [ 9 ] . Complement receptors ( CRs ) recognize components of the complement cascade , deposited on the surface of phagocytic BioMed Research International 3 Table 1 : Human phagocytic receptors and their ligands .

There are now three recognized gene superfam - ilies of complement receptors : ( i ) the short consensus repeat ( SCR ) modules that code for CR1 and CR2 , ( ii ) the ùõΩ 2 integrin family members CR3 and CR4 , and ( iii ) the immunoglobulin Ig - superfamily member CRIg [ 12 ] . Complement receptors , such as the integrin ùõº M ùõΩ 2 ( also known as CD11b / CD18 , CR3 , or Mac - 1 ) , bind the complement component iC3b deposited on pathogens to promote phagocytosis [ 38 , 39 ] . 2 . 2 . Receptors for Apoptotic Cells . In addition to foreign pathogens , in a normal organism there are millions of cells that die by apoptosis every day . These apoptotic bodies are constantly cleared by phagocytosis . Recognition of apoptotic bodies involves several signals . First , cells in apoptosis release molecules that normally do not exist outside cells . Some of these molecules include ATP , lysophosphatidylcholine , and sphingosine 1 - phosphate . These soluble molecules function as chemoattractants for phagocytes . Also , apoptotic cells are dis - played on their surface molecules , such as phosphatidylserine ( PS ) not normally present on a healthy cell [ 54 ] . These surface molecules function as an ‚Äúeat me‚Äù signal [ 55 ] for phagocytes . Some receptors such as TIM - 1 , TIM - 4 [ 48 ] , stabilin - 2 [ 49 ] , and BAI - 1 ( brain - specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 ) directly recognize PS [ 50 ] . Other receptors , for example , MFG - E8 ( lactadherin ) , can connect PS to ùõº V ùõΩ 3 integrins [ 51 ] . Apoptotic cells can also be recognized by scavenger receptors A ( SR - A ) , MARCO , and CD36 [ 56 ] . CD36 bind modified lipids , including oxidized PS [ 53 ] . Many normal cells can also express some amounts of PS on their membranes . However , PS increases as much as 300 - fold in apoptotic cells , creating a threshold that prevents phagocytosis of normal cells . There are some cells , for example , activated B and T cells , that may present large amounts of PS on their membrane . To prevent phagocytosis , these cells express molecules that deliver a ‚Äúdo not eat me‚Äù signal [ 4 ] . CD31 is one such molecule . It prevents phagocytosis by promoting cell detachment after homotypic ( self ) - binding [ 57 ] . Also , CD47 is another molecule that blocks phagocytosis of cells expressing it on their surface . CD47 binds to the receptor SIRP ùõº ( signal regulatory pro - tein ùõº ) , on the membrane of phagocytes , and delivers an inhibitory signal for actin assembly [ 58 ] . Another level of complexity is the fact that multiple receptors bind apoptotic cells directly or indirectly and professional phagocytes coex - press many of these receptors . Thus , there are still many uni - dentified mechanisms for phagocytosis via apoptotic recep - tors . Because , it is now recognized that clearance of apoptotic cells is fundamental for tissue homeostasis [ 59 ] , future research will bring us great surprises in this area . 2 . 3 . Receptor Cooperation . For an efficient recognition of the target particle , multiple receptors on the phagocyte must engage multiple ligands on the particle . This interaction 4 BioMed Research International depends on the relative affinity of the molecules involved and also on their density on the surface of both the leukocyte and the particle . In addition , the relative mobility of the receptors on the membrane of the phagocyte affects the avidity of the interaction [ 60 ] . Because phagocytic receptors get activated when they aggregate in the plane of the membrane , only receptors capable of fast lateral diffusion are more likely to form multimers and get activated than immobile receptors ( see section on phagosome formation ) . Aggregation ( also called crosslinking ) of the receptors is additionally promoted by the active nature of phagocytes , which constantly form membranous projections to probe their environments [ 61 , 62 ] . Thus , particle recognition by receptor binding and activation are very active processes . Another aspect of receptor cooperation is observed when integrin receptors , such as the CR3 , increase their affinity for their ligand only after the phagocyte gets extra stimuli through TLRs [ 63 ] , Fc receptors [ 64 ] , or CD44 [ 65 ] . These receptors initiate intracellular signaling that activates the small GTPase Rap1 [ 66 ] , which in turn provokes conforma - tional changes in the integrin , leading to its increased affinity . This process is called inside - out signaling because the signal that activates the integrin comes from inside the cell . During the phagocytic process integrins get activated to promote efficient receptor binding all around the target particle ( see later ) . 3 . Particle Internalization When a particle interacts with phagocyte receptors , a series of signaling events are triggered to activate phagocytosis . Important changes in membrane remodeling and the actin cytoskeleton take place leading to the formation of pseu - dopods that cover the particle . At the point of contact , a depression of the membrane ( the phagocytic cup ) is formed . Then , the membrane surrounds the target particle and within few minutes it closes at the distal end , leaving a new phago - some . The signaling cascades are known in great detail for the Fc receptors and the complement receptors , since these are the best - studied phagocytic receptors [ 38 , 67 , 68 ] . Sig - naling for other phagocytic receptors is just beginning to be explored . Great interest exists in this area and research will certainly be fruitful in the near future . 3 . 1 . Fc ùõæ Receptor Signaling . Fc ùõæ receptors get activated in the plane of the phagocyte membrane when they aggregate after binding to their IgG ligands that cover the particle to be ingested . In humans there are several types of activating Fc ùõæ Rs that are coexpressed by professional phagocytes along with the only inhibitory Fc ùõæ RIIb . The clustering of activating Fc ùõæ Rs results in the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation ( ITAM ) motifs present within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor ( as is the case with Fc ùõæ RIIa and Fc ùõæ RIIc ) , or in an associated FcR common ùõæ - chain ( as with Fc ùõæ RI and Fc ùõæ RIIIa ) [ 9 , 10 , 69 ] . ITAM phosphorylation is carried out by Src - family kinases ( Lyn , Lck , and Hck specifically ) , creating a docking site for the SH2 domains of the tyrosine kinase Syk , which can itself phospho - rylate neighboring ITAM tyrosines [ 38 , 70 ] . The mechanism by which receptor aggregation induces phosphorylation of the ITAM tyrosines remains elusive . Aggregation may induce accumulation of the Fc ùõæ Rs in cholesterol - enriched lipid rafts , where Src - family kinases are concentrated . This model is supported by the fact that Fc ùõæ RIIa becomes associated with detergent - resistant membranes ( DRMs ) upon activation by aggregation [ 71 , 72 ] and that depletion of cholesterol with methyl - ùõΩ - cyclodextrin inhibits Fc ùõæ RII phosphorylation in response to aggregation [ 71 ] . Association of Fc ùõæ RIIa with DRMs depends on its palmitoylation on a cysteine residue [ 73 ] . Despite these reports , the model of lipid rafts presents some limitations that need to be considered . For example , not all Fc ùõæ receptors are palmitoylated ( like Fc ùõæ RIIa is ) ; thus other receptors may not associate with lipid rafts or they would do by another mechanism . Interestingly , a transmem - brane mutant form of Fc ùõæ RIIa that failed to associate with lipid rafts was still able to trigger phagocytosis [ 73 ] . Also , the use of methyl - ùõΩ - cyclodextrin to eliminate cholesterol from the cell membrane may be a very harsh treatment and the functional condition of the cell afterwards is not clear . More - over , lipid rafts disruption by cholesterol depletion did not inhibit phagocytosis in macrophages [ 74 ] . In addition , there is still a debate whether DRMs really reflect the segregation of lipids in membranes or are artificially induced by the detergents used in their preparation . Thus , the model of lipid rafts needs to be considered with caution [ 75 ] . As mentioned above , different phagocytes express more than one activating Fc ùõæ R , and at the same time they also express the inhibitory Fc ùõæ RIIb . The coexpression of both acti - vating and inhibitory Fc ùõæ R results in simultaneous triggering of activating and inhibitory signaling pathways [ 10 ] . Thus , a particular phagocyte will initiate phagocytosis when the sum of activating and inhibiting signals reaches a threshold of acti - vation that is determined by the relative expression of both types of Fc ùõæ R [ 76 ] . The importance of the inhibitory Fc ùõæ RIIb in regulating many IgG - mediated responses in different leukocytes was made evident in Fc ùõæ RIIb - deficient mice , which showed enhanced activity of many IgG - mediated cell responses including phagocytosis [ 77 ] . Another molecule that negatively regulates phagocytosis of macrophages is CD47 via SIRP ùõº [ 78 , 79 ] . Ligation of CD47 leads to phospho - rylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibition ( ITIM ) motif in the cytoplasmic tail of SIRP ùõº , which in turn recruits the phosphatase SHP - 1 [ 58 ] . By super - resolution microscopy , it has become evident that many receptors are found in clusters at the plasma membrane on a nanometer scale [ 80 ] . In the case of resting macrophages , it was recently found that nanoclusters of Fc ùõæ RI are constitutively associated with nanoclusters of SIRP ùõº . Upon Fc receptor activation , Src - family kinase signaling leads to segregation of Fc ùõæ RI and SIRP ùõº nanoclusters [ 81 ] , and co - ligation of SIRP ùõº with CD47 prevented nanocluster segregation . Thus , when the balance of signals favors activation , Fc ùõæ RI nanoclusters are separated from the inhibitory signal [ 81 ] . After Fc ùõæ R phosphorylation , Syk binds to the ITAM motifs and gets also activated . Syk has also been shown to be required for phagocytosis [ 38 , 70 ] and it is responsible for activation of several additional signaling proteins that get BioMed Research International 5 Fc Ìõæ RIIa IgG Actin polymerization PP PP SFK Syk Syk LAT JNK NF - ÌúÖ B ERK p38 Vav PI3K Myosin WASP Cdc42 Rac ER ScarWAVE DAG PKC Arp 2 / 3 complex PIP 3 PIP 2 PIP 2 IP 3 PLC Ìõæ Ca 2 + IP 3 R Figure 1 : Fc ùõæ receptor signal transduction . Fc ùõæ RIIa crosslinking by immunoglobulin ( IgG ) bound to a particle induces activation of Src family kinases ( SFK ) , which phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the ITAMs ( red box ) of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor . Then , Syk associates with phosphorylated ITAMs and leads to phosphorylation and activation of a signaling complex formed by the scaffold protein LAT ( linker for activation of T cells ) interacting with various proteins . Some of these proteins are phospholipase C gamma ( PLC ùõæ ) , which produces inositoltrisphosphate ( IP 3 ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) . These second messengers cause calcium release and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , respectively . PKC leads to activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( ERK and p38 ) . The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav activates the GTPase Rac , which is involved in regulation of the actin nucleation complex Arp2 / 3 , via the nucleation - promoting factor Scar / WAVE . Rac is also involved in activation of transcription factors such as NF - ùúÖ B and JNK . The enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , which is recruited and activated by Syk , generates the lipid phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) at the phagocytic cup . This lipid also regulates Rac activation and contractile proteins such as myosin . Another GTPase , Cdc42 , is also activated during Fc ùõæ R signaling by an unknown mechanism and induces actin polymerization by activating the nucleation - promoting factor WASp ( Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ) . P represents a phosphate group . ER , endoplasmic reticulum . recruited to the Fc ùõæ R signaling complex ( Figure 1 ) . The trans - membrane protein LAT ( linker for activation of T cells ) is phosphorylated by Syk . Phosphorylation of LAT induces docking of additional adaptors : Grb2 binds to LAT , and in turn it recruits Gab2 ( Grb2 - associated binder 2 ) . Gab2 is also phosphorylated by Syk . Other proteins are then also recruited to the complex . Among them is phospholipase C ( PLC ) ùõæ 1 , which produces inositoltrisphosphate ( IP 3 ) and diacylglyc - erol ( DAG ) . These second messengers cause calcium release and activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) , respectively . PKC leads to activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( ERK and p38 ) [ 82 ] . The guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) Vav activates GTPases of the Rho and Rac family , which are involved in regulation of the actin nucleation complex Arp2 / 3 , which induces the actin polymerization that drives pseudopod extension . Other enzymes such as phos - phatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI 3 - K ) activate the GTPase Rac and nuclear factors like NF - ùúÖ B ( Figure 1 ) . 3 . 1 . 1 . Lipid Signals . Signaling events regulating phagosome formation have also been examined by fluorescence imag - ing techniques . Detection of lipids and several activating proteins has shown that different molecules associate and dissociate from phagosomes in an orderly fashion ( Figure 2 ) . Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] is present in large amounts in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of resting phagocytes . During phagocytosis , the concentra - tion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 increases in the pseudopods that form the phagocytic cup but then decreases abruptly [ 83 ] . The dras - tic disappearance of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 following its modest initial 6 BioMed Research International Cdc42 DAG PI ( 3 ) P PKC Rac1 Rac2 actin PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( a ) Cdc42 DAG PI ( 3 ) P PKC Rac1 Rac2 actin PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( b ) Cdc42 DAG PI ( 3 ) P PKC Rac1 Rac2 actin PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( c ) Cdc42 DAG PI ( 3 ) P PKC Rac1 Rac2 actin PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( d ) Figure 2 : Signaling molecules concentrated in different parts of the membrane during phagocytosis . A phagocyte cell membrane around an IgG - opsonized particle is shown at different stages of phagosome formation . After initial recognition , membrane protrusions form a phagocytic cup ( a ) , then pseudopods extend around the particle ( b ) , and membrane fusion events at the distal end close the new vacuole ( c ) , which is finally separated as an intracellular phagosome ( d ) . Fluorescent protein chimeras were used to locate ( colored lines ) the signaling molecules PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , DAG , PKC , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P3 , PI ( 3 ) P , active ( GTP - bound ) Cdc42 , Rac1 , Rac2 , and actin . accumulation is essential to allow particle internalization , probably by facilitating actin disassembly [ 84 ] . Several path - ways contribute to the disappearance of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . PLC ùõæ is phosphorylated and recruited to the phagocytic cup in a Syk - dependent manner , probably by interaction with LAT [ 83 , 85 ] . PLC ùõæ activity is critical because its inhibition prevents DAG production and blocks phagocytosis [ 83 ] . In addition , DAG leads to activation of PKC ùúÄ , which enhances phagocy - tosis [ 86 ] . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is also consumed when it becomes phos - phorylated by PI - 3K , producing PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at the phagocytic cup [ 87 ] . PI - 3K is recruited and activated by Syk [ 88 ] , or by adaptor proteins such as Gab2 [ 89 ] ( Figure 1 ) . These dramatic changes in membrane lipid composition during Fc ùõæ receptor - mediated phagocytosis demonstrate that distinct molecules are activated and recruited in a carefully orchestrated manner to induce phagosome formation . 3 . 1 . 2 . Small GTPases . Small GTPases of the Rho family are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton . These enzymes function as molecular switches alternating between an active ( GTP - bound ) state and an inactive ( GDP - bound ) state [ 90 ] . For activation , they need to release GDP and replace it with GTP . This action is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) . Later , GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP returning the GTPase to its inactive state . This last step is enhanced through interactions with GTPase - activat - ing proteins ( GAPs ) . The GTPases Rac and Cdc42 are activated and recruited to the forming phagosome during Fc ùõæ receptor - mediated phagocytosis ( Figure 1 ) [ 91 ] . Cdc42 is activated early in phagocytosis mostly at the rims of the phagocytic cup [ 92 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Rac1 is activated throughout the entire nascent phagosome , whereas Rac2 is activated later , mostly at the base of the phagocytic cup [ 92 ] ( Figure 2 ) . Cdc42 and Rac participate in regulating the localized forma - tion of actin fibers , necessary for pseudopod extension , by activating the nucleation - promoting factors WASp ( Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome protein ) and Scar / WAVE , respectively [ 93 ] ( Figure 1 ) . WASp and Scar , in turn , activate the Arp2 / 3 complex for actin polymerization [ 94 ] ( Figure 1 ) . 3 . 2 . Complement Receptor Signaling . The integrin CR3 is the best - studied phagocytic complement receptor . For a long time , it has been recognized that engagement of CR3 on macrophages triggers a distinct form of phagocytosis , charac - terized by ‚Äúsinking‚Äù of the particle into the cell without form - ing the characteristic pseudopods of Fc ùõæ R phagocytosis [ 95 ] . However , this idea has been questioned by recent microscopy observations that showed membrane protrusions encircling the targets during CR3 - mediated phagocytosis [ 62 , 96 ] . Still , it is thought that integrin CR3 signaling for phagocytosis is very different from Fc ùõæ R signaling . Early reports demon - strated that phagocytosis of complement - opsonized zymo - san and of complement - opsonized erythrocytes was unaf - fected by tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ 97 ] . This ruled out the participation of tyrosine kinases in this type of phagocytosis . In addition , macrophages from Syk ‚àí / ‚àí mice showed normal levels of CR - mediated phagocytosis [ 98 ] . However , ùõΩ 2 inte - grin stimulation by adhesive ligands , or by artificial inte - grin cross - linking with antibodies induced various cellular responses in a Src and / or Syk kinase - dependent manner [ 99 ] . BioMed Research International 7 More recently , it was shown that Syk is phosphorylated during CR3 - mediated phagocytosis and its inhibition prevents par - ticle ingestion [ 100 ] . Also , Syk can be indirectly activated by integrins via the ITAM - bearing FcR ùõæ chain and / or DAP12 [ 101 ] . The reason Syk ‚àí / ‚àí macrophages are capable of CR - mediated phagocytosis while the other experimental systems clearly implicate Syk in integrin signaling remains a mystery . It might be possible that genetically deficient cells have upreg - ulated other molecules , for example , Zap70 , that allow the bypass of Syk during CR - mediated phagocytosis . Other differences between Fc ùõæ R - and CR - mediated pha - gocytosis seem to be the cytoskeleton requirements for par - ticle internalization . The actin cytoskeleton is required for Fc ùõæ R - mediated phagocytosis , whereas the actin and micro - tubule cytoskeletons are required for CR - mediated phago - cytosis [ 97 , 102 ] . Moreover , in complement phagocytosis F - actin accumulation and particle ingestion depend on RhoA , but not on Rac or Cdc42 [ 103 , 104 ] , and binding of iC3b - opsonized erythrocytes increased levels of Rho - GTP but not of Rac - GTP [ 105 ] . However , ingestion of iC3b - opson - ized erythrocytes is reduced in cells where Rac1 and Rac2 were deleted [ 106 ] . Together these findings challenge the clas - sical model that CR3 - mediated phagocytosis depends only on RhoA [ 106 ] . Rho , in turn , leads to actin polymerization via two mech - anisms ( Figure 3 ) . First , Rho can activate Rho kinase , which phosphorylates and activates myosin II [ 107 ] . Inhibition of Rho kinase activity also prevents accumulation of Arp2 / 3 and actin assembly at the phagocytic cup [ 107 ] . Second , Rho can induce accumulation of mDia1 ( mammalian diaphanous - related formin 1 ) and polymerized actin in the phagocytic cup . Interfering with mDia activity inhibits CR3 - mediated phagocytosis while having no effect on Fc ùõæ R - mediated pha - gocytosis [ 108 ] . Also , mDia1 binds directly to the microtu - bule - associated protein CLIP - 170 and induces its accumula - tion at the phagocytic cup [ 109 ] . This pathway also provides a link to the microtubule cytoskeleton required for CR - medi - ated phagocytosis [ 97 , 102 ] . Thus , microtubules and actin seem to function cooperatively in CR - mediated phagocytosis ( Figure 3 ) . The signaling pathway for Rho activation is not clearly defined . Two regions in the cytosolic domain of the ùõΩ 2 sub - unit of the integrin receptor are important for Rho activation during phagocytosis [ 105 ] , but it is not clear how the integrin connects to a Rho GEF for activation . In addition , Vav ( a Rho / Rac GEF ) originally reported to participate in Fc ùõæ R - mediated phagocytosis , but not in CR - mediated phagocytosis [ 110 ] , can also activate Rho [ 106 ] . Since , Rho participates in Arp2 / 3 activation and actin polymerization by CR3 [ 104 ] and Vav is a substrate for Syk [ 111 ] , it is possible that a connection exists for Rho activation via Syk and Vav [ 3 ] ( Figure 3 ) . 4 . Phagosome Formation As indicated before , phagocytosis commences by interaction of phagocytic receptors with ligands on the surface of target particles . Then , receptors must aggregate to initiate signaling pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton , so that the phagocyte can produce membrane protrusions for involving the particle . Finally , the particle is enclosed in a new vesicle that pinches out from the plasma membrane . 4 . 1 . Initial Interactions . The initial interactions of phagocytic receptors with the particle are not easy , since receptor ligands do not usually cover the particle uniformly and receptors are not freely accessible on the cell membrane . In fact , most phagocytic receptors are short molecules that extend only around 5 nm from the surface of the cell ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) and are found among many much longer , usually rigid , trans - membrane glycoproteins present throughout the membrane . These glycoproteins form a thick layer , known as glycocalyx , covering the cell membrane , that can effectively conceal short receptors [ 112 ] . Mucins , high molecular weight , heavily glyco - sylated proteins , CD44 and hyaluronan , and transmembrane phosphatases such as CD45 and CD148 are components of the glycocalyx that can reduce ligand access to receptors on the phagocyte membrane ( Figure 4 ( a ) ) . In addition , the lateral diffusion of receptors on the cell membrane can be effectively reduced by glycocalyx components that are teth - ered to cytoskeletal structures . These glycoproteins effectively act as the ‚Äúpickets‚Äù of a cytoskeletal ‚Äúfence‚Äù [ 13 , 14 ] that impedes free diffusion of other membrane molecules . This is the case for phagocytic receptors , which move only in discrete areas on the cell membrane among these immobile picket fences ( Figure 4 ( b ) ) . Phagocytes improve interactions of receptors with possi - ble targets by ( i ) creating active membrane protrusions that allow the cell to explore larger areas , increasing the chances for receptors to engage their ligands [ 61 , 113 ] , and by ( ii ) selec - tively removing some of these larger glycoproteins allowing the receptors to diffuse more freely on the membrane [ 114 ] . The phosphatase CD45 can extend more than 40 nm from the cell membrane [ 115 ] , and it is a real steric obstacle for phagocytic receptors . Removing these large molecules could greatly improve receptor binding . Indeed , removal of CD45 was first observed during Dectin - 1 - mediated phagocytosis in a structure that was called ‚Äúphagocytic synapse‚Äù [ 116 ] , for its similarity to the T lymphocyte immune synapse [ 117 ] . When T cell receptor ( TCR ) molecules on the T lymphocyte interact with MHC / peptide molecules on an antigen - presenting cell , a central cluster of engaged TCR is formed . The TCRs are sur - rounded by a ring of integrin LFA - 1 ( lymphocyte - function - associated antigen - 1 ) molecules , and CD45 is excluded from the central area . TCR interactions span around 15 nm , while integrin interactions span around 30 ‚Äì 40 nm between the two cells . Thus removal of the larger molecules helps an efficient TCR interaction . A similar situation for Fc ùõæ R - mediated phagocytosis has also been elegantly described recently by Sergio Grinstein‚Äôs group [ 114 ] . Besides its steric interference , there is another reason for removing CD45 from Fc ùõæ Rs . The tyrosine phosphatase CD45 must be taken away from sites of Fc ùõæ R engagement to allow full activation of Src tyrosine kinases , which phosphorylate ITAM sequences needed for activation of phagocytosis sig - naling [ 115 ] . First , CD45 must be allowed to diffuse more on the membrane . The lateral diffusion of CD45 is restricted by 8 BioMed Research International CR3 integrin actin polymerization P SFK Syk Vav ROCK Myosin II Rho mDia Microtubules Arp 2 / 3 complex P CLIP - 170 Figure 3 : Complement receptor signaling in phagocytosis . The complement receptor 3 ( CR3 integrin ) binds the complement fragment iC3b and initiates a signaling cascade that activates Rho , either independently of tyrosine kinases ( in macrophages ) or via Syk , which is recruited throughanITAM - bearingmolecule ( suchasDAP12ortheFcreceptor ùõæ chain ) . SykmayalsoactivatetheGEFVavtofurtheractivateRho . Rho , in turn , leads to actin polymerization via two mechanisms . Rho can activate Rho kinase ( ROCK ) , which phosphorylates and activates myosin II , inducing accumulation of Arp2 / 3 and actin assembly at the phagocytic cup . Rho can also induce accumulation of mDia1 ( mammalian diaphanous - related formin 1 ) , which promotes actin polymerization . In addition , mDia1 binds directly to the microtubule - associated protein CLIP - 170 providing a link to themicrotubule cytoskeleton . P represents a phosphate group . ITAM , immunoreceptor tyrosine - based activation motif . interactions between its cytoplasmic domain with ankyrin and spectrin molecules that connect to the actin cytoskeleton [ 118 ] . These interactions can be reduced by signals that alter the cytoskeleton and prime the cell for phagocytosis . TLR ligands , for example , LPS and bacterial DNA , can reduce the restricted diffusion of immunoreceptors [ 119 ] . Second , the more motile CD45 molecules need to be kept away from the engaged phagocytic receptor . This is achieved by the creation of a diffusion barrier made of activated integrins [ 114 ] . Fc ùõæ Rs ( and also G - protein coupled receptors or TLR ) deliver signals for inside - out activation of integrins . Inactive integrins exist in a bent conformation that does not bind ligands . The signal from Fc ùõæ R can produce DAG and Ca 2 + , which together activate CalDAG - GEF1 ( a GEF for Rap ) . The small GTPase Rap in its GTP form is then able to recruit RIAM and talin to the cytoplasmic tail of the ùõΩ subunit of integrins [ 120 ] ( Figure 4 ( c ) ) . This triggers the unfolding of the integrin into a high affinity ‚Äúactive‚Äù state . Kindlin - 3 is another molecule that also binds to the ùõΩ subunit of integrins causing their activa - tion [ 121 , 122 ] . The extended active integrin can then bind to many different ligands on the target particle [ 123 ] . Thus , integrins participate in Fc ùõæ R - mediated phagocytosis by pro - moting adhesion to the opsonized particle [ 124 ] . In addition , the integrin molecules that get engaged by ligands get also tethered to the actin cytoskeleton and , with this , they form a diffusional barrier for CD45 molecules . The extended inte - grin bound to the target particle effectively pushes out the larger glycocalyx components , such as CD45 ( Figure 5 ) . As more integrin molecules get engaged they function as a progressive wave migrating ahead of the engaged Fc ùõæ Rs , allowing new receptors to aggregate in microclusters [ 14 ] ( Figure 5 ) . 4 . 2 . Actin Remodeling in Membrane Protrusions . After a target particle is detected , the phagocytic process requires remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton to promote changes of the plasma membrane . The process is very complex and we have only a partial understanding of it . However , several important steps directed by actin remodeling , to form the pseudopodia that will cover the particle , can be identified . First , the membrane - associated cortical cytoskeleton , of the resting phagocyte , needs to be disrupted . Second , nucleation of actin filaments takes place in order to initiate F - actin polymerization and extension of pseudopodia . Third , actin gets depolymerized from the base of the phagocytic cup and the phagosome is closed at the distal end [ 13 ] . These steps of the precise temporal and spatial activation and inactivation of multiple proteins that govern F - actin dynamics are described next and presented in Figure 6 . A resting phagocyte presents a membrane - associated cor - tical cytoskeleton that provides cell shape . Upon activation , this cytoskeleton is disrupted by the action of coronins ( F - actin debranching proteins ) [ 125 ] and cofilin [ 126 ] and gelsolin [ 127 ] ( F - actin - severing proteins ) .

( a ) Most phagocytic receptors , such as receptors for antibody ( Fc ùõæ RIIa ) and receptors for complement ( Integrin CR3 ) are small molecules that extend only few nanometers from the plasma membrane . In contrast , transmembrane glycoproteins , such as phosphatases CD45 ( CD45RO and CD45RA isoforms ) , are much longer and usually rigid molecules . ( b ) In the resting state , receptors cannot diffuse freely throughout the membrane . Their movement is restricted by fences of transmembrane glycoprotein ‚Äúpickets‚Äù attached to an actin mesh . ( c ) Fc ùõæ R aggregation triggers an inside - out signal that activates integrins . Fc ùõæ R - induced activation of phospholipase C ( PLC ) produces diacylglycerol ( DAG ) that leads to activation of CalDAG ( a Rap GEF ) , which in turn activates Rap . Activated Rap ( Rap GTP ) is responsible for integrin activation by disrupting interactions between integrin subunits and promoting binding to talin , vinculin , and the actin cytoskeleton . accumulates at the nascent phagosome during both Fc ùõæ R - and CR - mediated phagocytosis [ 125 ] , and , in macrophages , it can interact with F - actin and inhibit the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 125 ] . Coronin 1 debranches F - actin leaving linear fibers that can be severed by cofilin and gelsolin ( Figure 6 , step ( b ) ) . Their activity is controlled by modulating their association with filaments , or by sequestering them away from filaments by binding to phosphoinositides , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 127 , 128 ] . In addition , the vesicular OCRL phosphatase activity to hydrolyze PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 seems to contribute to the step of actin depolymerization [ 129 ] . The role for these enzymes in phago - cytosis is much more complex than just described , and future research is needed in this area [ 13 ] . This initial disruption of the cytoskeleton has two consequences : it provides G - actin monomers for incorporation into new filaments and increases the mobility of nonligated receptors on the mem - brane ( see previous section ) . The second step is the nucleation of actin filaments to initiate F - actin polymerization and extension of pseudopodia ( Figure 6 , step ( c ) ) . This is achieved mainly by the action of the Arp2 / 3 protein complex , which can be stimulated by different pathways . In fact , as indicated above the signaling pathways triggered by the best - studied phagocytic receptors , namely , Fc ùõæ Rs and CRs , are very dif - ferent ( see Figures 1 and 3 ) . For Fc ùõæ R - mediated phagocytosis , Arp2 / 3 is recruited to the nascent phagocytic cup , where its actin - nucleating activity is stimulated by WASp and N - WASp [ 130 , 131 ] , which in turn are activated by Cdc42 - GTP and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 132 ] . In the case of CR - mediated phagocytosis , actin polymerization is associated with RhoA [ 133 ] . This GTPase recruits and stimulates mDia formins [ 108 ] , which 10 BioMed Research International Fc Ìõæ RIIa IgG PP SFK Integrin CD45RO CD45RA T a l i n K i n d l i n V i n c u l i n Rap GTP PP Figure 5 : Initial engagement of phagocytic receptors .

Thisleadstoinside - outsignalingforintegrin ( CR3 ) activation via the GTPase Rap . Activated integrin binds to adaptor molecules such as talin , vinculin , and kindlin - 3 and connect to the actin cytoskeleton . Activated integrins also bind to the particle ( via multiple possible ligands [ 113 ] ) and form a diffusion barrier that excludes larger molecules , such as the transmembrane phosphatase CD45 . This allows other Fc receptors to be engaged and increase the signaling for phagocytosis .

( a ) Phagocytes explore their surroundings for phagocytic targets by projecting membrane ruffles , filopodia , and podosomes . These membranes contain mostly linear actin fibers . ( b ) Upon recognition of a target particle , the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted at the phagocytic cup by the action of coronins ( F - actin debranching proteins ) and cofilin and gelsolin ( F - actin - severing proteins ) . ( c ) As more phagocytic receptors get engaged around the particle , the cell extends pseudopodia , which contain new branched actin fibers . Actin nucleation and F - actin polymerization are mediated by the Arp2 / 3 protein complex , which can be stimulated by the GTPases Rac and Cdc42 , via the nucleation - promoting factor Scar / WAVE . ( d ) At the last step , depolymerization of actin filaments from the base of the nascent phagosome may facilitate curving of the membrane around the particle and provide room for fusion of internal vesicles , a source of endomembranes . Actin depolymerization is controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , through its product phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) , which may recruit Rho GAPs that inactivate the GTPases Rac and Cdc42 , thus reducing Arp2 / 3 activity . PIP 3 also recruits myosins , which provide contractile activity that facilitates phagosome closure . At the same time , phospholipase C ( PLC ) cleaves phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) to generate diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) . The reduction of PIP 2 will liberate cofilin and increase F - actin severing activity . BioMed Research International 11 in turn also activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3 ) . However , other GTPases , such as Rap , seem to play a role in CR - mediated phagocytosis , independently of RhoA [ 134 ] . Rap - GTP also activates profilin , which is essential for actin polymerization via formins [ 135 ] . Rap can also activate the GTPase Rac [ 106 ] . But as discussed earlier , the role of Rac in complement - mediated phagocytosis remains a subject of debate . 4 . 3 . Phagosome Sealing . The last step in phagosome forma - tion is characterized by elimination of F - actin from the base of the phagocytic cup , just before the membrane protrusions fuse at the other end to seal the nascent phagosome ( Figure 6 , panel ( d ) ) . Depolymerization of actin filaments from the phagocytic cup may also facilitate curving of the membrane around the particle and provide room for fusion of internal vesicles , a source of endomembranes [ 129 ] . The mechanism for actin removal from the forming phagosome has been poorly defined , and much more research is needed in this topic . The mechanism for removing F - actin must include the termination of actin polymerization and the detachment and depolymerization of existing filaments . Both steps seem to be controlled by phosphoinositides , in particular PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , the product of PI - 3K . Inhibition of this enzyme prevents depolymerization of actin at the base of the phagocytic cup and arrests extension of pseudopods [ 136 ] . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 can activate Rho - family GAPs , which will induce deactivation of the GTPases stimulated during phagocytosis [ 137 , 138 ] . Supporting this idea is the fact that PI - 3K inhibition causes accumulation of activated Cdc42 and Rac at the phagocytic cup [ 92 , 137 ] . However , because inhibition of PI - 3K blocks phagocytosis even when GTPases are constitutively activated [ 137 ] , this enzyme must control other molecules important for phagocytosis . One such molecule is PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which decreases by the action of PI - 3K , but also by the action of PLC ùõæ . Since PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sequesters cofilin and gelsolin and it is required for WASp activation , its reduction will increase F - actin severing ( by liberation of cofilin and gelsolin ) and reduce actin polymerization ( by inhibition of WASp ) [ 13 ] . Other molecules regulated by PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 are myosins . Myo - sins exert contractile activity that functions as a purse string to facilitate phagosome closure [ 139 ‚Äì 142 ] ( Figure 6 , step ( d ) ) . Recently , the process of phagosome formation and clo - sure has been revisited thanks to live microscopy with the technique of total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy ( TIRFM ) [ 143 ] . In this way , an important role for dynamin - 2 in phagosome formation was revealed . Dynamin - 2 , which mediates the scission of endocytic vesicles , was recruited along with actin during phagosome formation , and depoly - merization of actin led to impaired dynamin - 2 recruitment or activity . Also , dynamin - 2 accumulated at the site of phagosome closure [ 144 ] . Thus , it seems there is a cross - talk between actin and dynamin for phagosome formation and closure before dynamin functions for scission [ 144 ] . 5 . Phagolysosome Maturation The phagosome changes its membrane composition and its contents , to turn into a phagolysosome , a vesicle that can destroy the particle ingested . This transformation is known as phagosome maturation ( Figure 7 ) and consists of successive fusion and fission interactions between the new phagosome and early endosomes , late endosomes , and finally lysosomes . At the end , the mature phagosome , also called phagolyso - some , has a different membrane composition , which allows it to contain a very acidic and degradative environment [ 145 , 146 ] . 5 . 1 . Early Phagosome . The new phagosome rapidly gets the properties of early endosomes , by fusing with sorting and recycling endosomes [ 28 ] . Its interior becomes a little acidic ( pH 6 . 1 ‚Äì 6 . 5 ) but it is not very destructive . Membrane fusion events between the phagosome and early endosomes are reg - ulated by the small GTPase Rab5 [ 147 , 148 ] . This membrane GTPase is required for the transition from an early to a late phagosome . Rab5 functions through the recruitment of EEA1 ( early endosome antigen 1 ) , which promotes fusion of the new phagosome with early endosomes [ 149 ] . Rab5 also recruits class III PI - 3K human vacuolar protein - sorting 34 ( hvPS34 ) , which , in turn , generates phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate [ PI ( 3 ) P ] [ 150 ] . This lipid then helps fix EEA1 to the cytosolic face of the phagosome and promotes recruitment of other proteins involved in phagosome maturation , including Rab7 , a marker of late endosomes [ 151 , 152 ] . EEA1 functions as a bridge that tethers early endosomes to incoming endocytic vesicles [ 153 ] and binds to syntaxin 13 , a SNARE ( soluble NSF - attachment protein receptor ) protein required for membrane fusion [ 154 ] . Despite fusion with multiple early endosomes , the new phagosome does not seem to change size . This is due to the retrieval of vesicles to endosomes and the trans - Golgi network . Acidification of the phagosome lumen results from the gradual accumulation of active V - ATPases on the phago - some membrane . This V - ATPase is a multimeric protein complex that translocates protons ( H + ) into the lumen of the phagosome using cytosolic ATP as an energy source [ 155 , 156 ] ( Figure 7 ) . In order to keep an electrical balance across the phagosome membrane , negative anions ( mainly Cl ‚àí ) also move inside , while cations ( such as K + and Na + ) move outside [ 157 , 158 ] . 5 . 2 . Intermediate Phagosome . As maturation proceeds , Rab5 is lost , and Rab7 appears on the membrane . The vpsC - homo - typic protein - sorting ( HOPS ) complex mediates the transi - tion from Rab5 to Rab7 endosomes [ 152 ] and may function in a similar fashion in phagosome maturation . Rab7 mediates the fusion of the phagosome with late endosomes [ 159 ] . At the same time , intraluminal vesicles are now formed . They con - tain membrane - associated molecules that are intended for degradation . These vesicles seem to arise from inwards bud - ding and pinching of the limiting membrane of the phago - some [ 145 ] . The membrane proteins marked for degradation are ubiquitinated and associate with the endosomal - sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) [ 160 ] . This complex forms a circular array that directs the vesicles into the lumen of the phagosome [ 161 ] ( Figure 7 ) . 12 BioMed Research International Lysosome Bacteria ( a ) Early ( b ) Intermediate ( c ) Late ( d ) Phagolysosome Multivesicular body Early endosome Late endosome Rab 7 LAMP2 Microtubules Dynein RILP NADPH NADPH NADPH Hydrolases Cathepsins Cathepsins Hydrolases VPS34 Recycling endosome Bacteria EEA1 Rab 5 V - ATPase HOPS ESCRT ILV Rab 5 Trans - Gogi network Figure7 : Phagosome maturation .

Four stages of maturation have been described : early ( a ) , intermediate ( b ) , late ( c ) , and phagolysosome ( d ) . In this process , the phagosome becomes increasingly acidic by the action of a proton - pumping V - ATPase and gets various degradative enzymes . The composition of the membrane also changes to include molecules that control membrane fusion , such as the GTPases Rab . See text for details .

Late Phagosome . Once the intermediate phagosome eliminates the proteins that will be recycled or degraded , it continues maturation to a late phagosome . Rab7 accumulates and becomes a marker for this stage . Rab7 recruits new pro - teins to the membrane . One such protein is Rab - interacting lysosomal protein ( RILP ) , which binds to the dynein - dynactin complex [ 162 , 163 ] and brings the phagosome in contact with microtubules . This mediates the centripetal movement of late phagosomes and lysosomes [ 162 , 163 ] that brings the organelles in close contact so that SNARE proteins , such as VAMP ( vesicle - associated membrane protein ) 7 and VAMP8 can complete membrane fusion [ 164 , 165 ] . At this stage , the lumen gets more acidic ( pH 5 . 5 ‚Äì 6 . 0 ) , thanks to more V - ATPase molecules on the membrane [ 155 ] ( Fig - ure 7 ) . In addition , lysosomal - associated membrane proteins ( LAMPs ) and luminal proteases ( cathepsins and hydrolases ) are incorporated from fusion with late endosomes or from the Golgi complex [ 145 , 146 ] . 5 . 4 . Phagolysosome . The last stage in the maturation process involves fusion of late phagosomes with lysosomes , to become phagolysosomes . Phagolysosomes are the ultimate micro - bicidal organelle [ 28 ] . Phagolysosomes count with many sophisticated mechanisms directed to eliminate and degrade microorganisms . They are highly acidic ( pH as low as 4 . 5 ) thanks to the large number of V - ATPase molecules on their membrane [ 156 ] . Phagolysosomes are also characterized by a PI ( 3 ) P - enriched internal membrane [ 166 , 167 ] and by the lack of mannose - 6 - phosphate receptors [ 168 ] . They also contain a number of hydrolytic enzymes , including various cathepsins , proteases , lysozymes , and lipases [ 155 ] . Other microbicidal components of the phagosome are scavenger molecules , such as lactoferrin that sequesters the iron required by some bacte - ria [ 169 ] and the NADPH oxidase that generates superoxide ( O 2‚àí ) [ 170 ] ( Figure 7 ) . Superoxide can dismutate to H 2 O 2 , which can in turn react with O 2‚àí to generate more - complex reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , such as hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen [ 171 ] . In addition , H 2 O 2 can be combined with Cl ‚àí ions into hypochlorous acid by the enzyme myeloperox - idase [ 172 ] . 6 . Conclusion Phagocytosis is an elegant and very complex process for the ingestion and elimination of pathogens and apoptotic cells . It is performed by a series of cells we call professional phagocytes . They are monocytes , macrophages , neutrophils , dendritic cells , osteoclasts , and eosinophils . It is evident that phagocytosis is fundamental for tissue homeostasis , control - ling important aspects of inflammation and the immune response . Clearly , the many cell types that can perform phagocytosis and the overwhelming number of different phagocytic targets require more than one mechanism to com - plete this cellular function . We have presented the main four steps of phagocytosis to provide a general view of the whole process . Still , we have to keep in mind that this description corresponds primarily to opsonic receptors . We have very little knowledge of the signaling pathways other phagocytic receptors activate . Similarly , the process of phagosome matu - ration has gained much information from studies on vesicular traffic . Yet , important gaps remain in every step . Also , how the final phagolysosome completes its antimicrobial or deg - radative functions is not completely clear . But , the fact that several microbial pathogens have developed special ways for interfering with phagolysosome function gives us another opportunity to learn from them novel aspects on phagocy - tosis . In addition , the resolution of the phagolysosome , after the infection or the inflammation processes have terminated , is an area that has brought very little attention . What are the molecular details and functional implications of ingesting different particles ? How the various phagocytic receptors on the same phagocyte cooperate ? And how the various phago - cytes participate in tissue homeostasis ? These are important questions that future research in this exciting area will have BioMed Research International 13 to address . An improved understanding of phagocytosis is essential for the clear implications it has for antigen presen - tation and autoimmune disease .
