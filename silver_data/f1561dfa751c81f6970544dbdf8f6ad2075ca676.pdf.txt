In yeast , tethering and lipid transfer between the two organelles is mediated by the ER - mitochondria encounter structure ERMES , a four - subunit complex of unclear stoichiometry and architecture . We determined the molecular organization of ERMES within cells using integrative structural biology , combining quantitative live - imaging , cryo - correlative microscopy , subtomogram averaging and molecular modeling . ERMES assembles into approximately 25 discrete bridge - like complexes distributed irregularly across a contact site . Each bridge consists of three lipid - binding SMP domains arranged in zig - zag fashion . Our molecular model of ERMES reveals an unconventional restrained pathway for lipids . These findings resolve a supramolecular architecture controlling interorganelle lipid fluxes . Introduction : Lipids are fundamental constituents of eukaryotic cells and are mainly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . The ER supplies lipids to other organelles for membrane homeostasis and expansion . Although lipids and proteins traffic via vesicles from the ER to outlying organelles , the bulk of cellular lipid flux occurs through membrane contact sites ( MCS ) ( 1 ) , which are regions where two organelles are physically apposed ( 2 ) . For lipid flux between the ER and mitochondria , MCS are the only conduit ( 3 - 5 ) . In yeast , ER - mitochondrial MCS are mediated exclusively by the ER - mitochondria encounter structure ( ERMES ) , which is necessary for respiratory function , mitochondrial morphology , and maintenance of the mitochondrial genome ( 6 , 7 ) . ERMES mediates the transport of phospholipids between ER and mitochondria ( 8 , 9 ) , possibly underpinning its roles in mitochondrial function . ERMES is composed of four core components , Mmm1 , Mdm12 , Mdm34 and Mdm10 , which have molecular weights between 31 and 56 kDa ( 6 ) . Three of them share conserved synaptotagmin - like mitochondrial - lipid - binding ( SMP ) domains , characteristic of many MCS lipid transfer proteins in yeast and mammals ( 10 - 12 ) . Although structural information on SMP domains is available , including for Mmm1 and Mdm12 , it remains unknown how SMP domains arrange between two organelles to drive inter - organelle 3 lipid transfer ( 13 - 17 ) . Specifically , whether ERMES subunits arrange into stoichiometric complexes that form lipid shuttles or continuous conduits is unclear . Results and Discussion : To reveal the supramolecular structure of ERMES - mediated MCS in budding yeast , determine the in situ organization of ERMES SMP domains and obtain insights into the mechanism of lipid transfer , we used an integrative structural biology approach . When observed by fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) , the three SMP - domain containing ERMES components Mmm1 , Mdm12 and Mdm34 organize as diffraction limited puncta that correspond to ER - mitochondria MCS ( Figure 1A ) ( 6 ) . We first determined the number of ERMES components per puncta and their ratio by quantitative live cell FM ( 18 , 19 ) . Fluorescence intensity measurements provided us with an estimate of the absolute number of molecules per MCS of the three ERMES components ( Figure 1B ) . The number of Mmm1 and Mdm34 molecules matched closely ( 25 - 27 and 26 - 29 molecules / punctum , respectively ) , and was also similar for Mdm12 ( 19 - 22 molecules / punctum ) ( Figure 1C ) . We thus propose that ER - mitochondria MCS consist of similar protein copy numbers of the three SMP - domain containing ERMES components . The lower abundance of Mdm12 could reflect its assembly properties , as Mdm12 is cytosolic and its targeting to MCS might require its interaction partners Mdm34 and Mmm1 to be present ( 14 , 20 ) . In contrast , Mmm1 is anchored to the ER by a transmembrane domain , and Mdm34 associates tightly with the outer mitochondrial membrane ( OMM ) protein Mdm10 ( 20 , 21 ) . Nevertheless , considering that the SMP domains of Mmm1 and Mdm12 form a stable equimolar complex in vitro ( 16 ) , our finding supports a model of ERMES assembling as a protein complex with equimolar stoichiometry between Mmm1 , Mdm12 and Mdm34 . A stoichiometric ERMES complex is compatible with both proposed functional models : that of a stable conduit bridging the ER to mitochondria , or of a mobile shuttle moving between these two organelles . To determine the mode of lipid transport at ER - mitochondria MCS , we visualized ERMES MCS in vitrified yeast cells using correlative light and electron cryo - microscopy ( cryo - CLEM ) . Vitrified cells were thinned into lamellae using cryo - focused ion beam ( FIB ) milling ( 22 ) , then imaged using cryo - FM to determine the presence and position of ERMES puncta , marked by Mdm34 - mNeonGreen , within each lamella ( Figure 2A ) . Regions of lamellae with ERMES puncta were then imaged using electron cryo - tomography ( cryo - ET ) . This approach reliably directed data collection to ER - mitochondria MCS . These MCS consisted of diverse morphologies of ER and mitochondria ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . ER 4 membranes in contact with mitochondria did not show preferred curvature : convex ( 28 % ) , concave ( 33 % ) , convex and concave in different locations of the same MCS ( 5 % ) , or nearly flat ( 33 % , N = 60 MCS ) membranes were all observed . Generally , the ER in the MCS appeared to be pressed against the OMM ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . In some cases , the ER was wrapped around the mitochondrial surface ( Supplementary Figure S1A and C ) ; in others , ER tubules passed through holes in mitochondria ( Supplementary Figure S1D and E ) . Occasionally , we found peroxisomes near ER - mitochondria MCS , often in close contact with the ER ( Supplementary Figure S1B and E ) . Notably , in addition to 51 tomograms of ER - mitochondria MCS , 9 tomograms collected at fluorescent ERMES puncta contained no ER - mitochondrial MCS but instead ER - peroxisome MCS ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . These observations are in line with previous findings that ERMES can localize to MCS involving peroxisomes ( 23 , 24 ) . Importantly , the cryo - CLEM approach provided us with confidence that the imaged MCS contained a significant amount of ERMES ( Figure 2B ) . Within ER - mitochondria MCS we found numerous dense , bridge - like structures spanning the gap between the two organelles ( Figures 2C ) . These structures were on average 24 . 2 nm in length ( standard deviation ( SD ) = 4 . 76 nm , N = 1098 bridges , Figure 2D ) . A median of 24 bridge structures were observed per tomogram ( median absolute deviation ( MAD ) = 17 . 8 , N = 51 tomograms ) ( Figures 2E ) . The number of bridge structures is in close agreement with the number of molecules of Mmm1 , Mdm12 and Mdm34 per diffraction limited puncta . These findings suggest that the bridge structures , which are located at puncta of Mdm34 - mNeonGreen , represent the ERMES complex forming a continuous structure between the ER and mitochondrial membranes . To gain structural details of the bridges and insight into the organization of ERMES , we used subtomogram averaging ( STA ) to determine an average 3D map from subvolumes containing the bridge structures ( Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 ) . Our structural map fills the distance between the ER and mitochondria , likely corresponding to the full cytosolic portion of the ERMES complex ( Figure 2F ) . There are two bends along the map which produce a zig - zag arrangement of three segments similar in size and shape ( Figure 2G , Movie S1 ) . This overall structure suggests the assembly of three SMP domains arranged consecutively in a continuous string . The order of the arrangement is deducible from information available on the three SMP domain containing components : Mmm1 is anchored in the ER and interacts with Mdm12 ; Mdm34 interacts with Mdm12 and with the OMM protein Mdm10 ( 16 , 20 , 5 21 ) . Thus , in our map , the segment nearest the ER is likely to contain the Mmm1 SMP domain , the central segment Mdm12 , and the segment nearest the OMM Mdm34 . Such an organization fits with the equimolar ratio of components determined by FM . We propose that ERMES bridges the space between the ER and mitochondria through a stable complex in which each component contributes one SMP domain , strung in a zig - zag assemblage . In vitro , the Mmm1 SMP domain homo - dimerizes like SMP domains of other lipid transfer proteins and could thus mediate dimerization of ERMES bridges through an interaction near the ER membrane ( 13 , 16 , 25 ) . Since our STA approach averaged individual bridges , we could have missed such dimers . We therefore used tomographic coordinates of bridge - membrane anchor points proximal to the ER and the OMM , as well as the centers of the bridges , to determine whether the bridges had a specific arrangement relative to each other ( Figure 3A ) . For each anchor point , we measured the distance to its nearest neighboring anchor point . We reasoned that if Mmm1 dimerized as in the crystal structure ( 16 ) , the distance between two neighboring ER anchors would be shorter than between bridge centers or OMM anchor points . If there was another oligomerization at neighboring OMM anchors , the distance between the latter could be similar to ER anchor points , and it would be shorter than between neighboring center points ( Figure 3B ) . Our analysis revealed that for ER anchors , bridge center points and OMM anchors , the distances between nearest neighbors were equivalent ( median + / - MAD : 14 . 8 nm + / - 8 . 0 nm , 14 . 3 nm + / - 7 . 5 nm and 14 . 3 nm + / - 7 . 9 nm , respectively ; Figure 3C ) . We conclude that an arrangement involving dimerization of Mmm1 SMP domains as observed in vitro does not occur in the cell . We did not include the membranes in our STA procedure ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) to avoid these large structures dominating the alignment of subvolumes containing the bridges . We noticed , however , that many bridges were not perpendicular to the membranes , but displayed an angled orientation . To assess this observation quantitatively , we performed another alignment of the previously aligned bridge subvolumes , this time using the OMM as our target feature ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . The difference in the angle relative to the membranes between the initial bridge alignment and the OMM alignment position was 15 . 8° + / - 13 . 8° ( median + / - MAD , Figure 3D ) . These results indicate that there is flexibility in the positioning of ERMES bridges relative to the membranes ; possibly provided by hinge - like regions at the interfaces between the cytosolic and membrane parts of ERMES . This flexibility in orientation 6 could help ERMES bridges to accommodate varying membrane curvatures of the ER and the OMM as well as potential pushing and pulling forces acting on the organelles . When we placed the STA map back into tomograms at positions of the individual subvolumes , we observed that the bridges were distributed within the MCS in clusters of varying density ( Figure 3E , Movies S2 - S7 ) . To estimate the area of membrane serviced by an individual ERMES bridge we measured the surface area of the ER membrane interfacing with the OMM . We found that one ERMES bridge occupied 1359 nm 2 + / - 483 nm 2 ( median + / - MAD , N = 60 MCS ) of ER membrane ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) . Thus , if equally distributed within MCS , the distance between bridges would be approximately 40 nm . However , the closest neighbor of each bridge was 15 nm away ( Figure 3C ) , indicating that ERMES bridges are not distributed homogenously , but rather in irregular clusters . The number of bridges found per MCS correlated with the ER membrane surface area in contact with mitochondria ( Figure 3F ) , suggesting that the number of ERMES bridges is limited to approximately 12 bridges per 10 , 000 nm 2 of ER surface area . Thus , while the distribution of bridges within the MCS appears to adopt no regular pattern and the morphologies of MCS are diverse , the number of ERMES bridges per surface area ( Figure 3F ) and per MCS ( Figure 1C ) appear to be constrained , indicative of spatial regulation of ERMES organization across MCS . We next set out to investigate the molecular architecture of the ERMES complex . Our STA map suggests a zig - zag arrangement of three SMP domains ( Figure 2G ) . We sought to test if such an arrangement is compatible with the structural properties of the components . We predicted the structures of heterodimers ( Mmm1 - Mdm12 , Mdm12 - Mdm34 and Mdm34 - Mdm10 ) using FoldDock ( FD ) ( 26 ) , an AlphaFold ( AF ) - based tool ( 27 ) , and assembled the complex based on the sequential order of the components derived from our STA map and previous findings ( 16 , 20 , 21 ) ( Figure 4A ) . FD predicted a sequential tail - to - head arrangement of the SMP domains of Mmm1 , Mdm12 and Mdm34 , with the head - terminal loop of one subunit interacting with the crevice formed by the next subunit ( Figure 4B ) , similar to the interfaces observed in the X - ray structure of the Mmm1 - Mdm12 dimer ( 16 ) . Notably , rather than the zig - zag arrangement we observed in situ , the in silico FD prediction suggested a more ‘linear’ conformation of the complex , similar to the in vitro arrangement ( 16 ) . To adjust the predicted complex structure to our experimental STA map , we performed atomistic Molecular Dynamics 7 Flexible Fitting ( MDFF ) of the ERMES complex with an explicit lipid bilayer mimicking the OMM ( Figure 4A , Supplementary Figure S7 and Movie S8 ) . Of note , even though the STA map does not provide secondary structure information , limiting the overall accuracy of our model , fitting to the STA map only moderately modifies the inter - subunit interfaces , which remain nearly in their initial FD - predicted conformations ( Figures 4A and B ) . Furthermore , our model does not completely occupy the STA map density around Mdm12 and Mdm34 ( Figure 4A ) . The extra density in the map could be explained by the intrinsically disordered or dynamic protein regions that we excluded from modeling due to their poorly predicted structures , or binding of auxiliary factors such as the regulatory proteins Gem1 ( 21 , 28 ) , Tom7 ( 20 ) or Emr1 ( 29 ) . We next investigated whether the proposed complex is compatible with a tunnel - like lipid transport mechanism . In such a scenario , lipids should slide through the SMP domains and , importantly , move between subunits via their interfaces . In our final MDFF model , the cavities of the SMP domains do not form a continuous conduit , as they are too narrow for lipid transport at the Mdm12 - Mdm34 and Mmm1 - Mdm12 interfaces ( Figures 4C and Supplementary Figure S8 ) . This observation suggests that unlike other tunnel - like lipid transfer proteins such as the VPS13 family , which form large unrestrained conduits ( 30 , 31 ) , the lipid pathway in ERMES could be restrained by bottlenecks at the interfaces between domains . Furthermore , in our model , the cavity of Mdm34 is near the OMM surface , and the predicted interaction between Mdm34 and the OMM protein Mdm10 occurs close to residues previously found to drive Mdm34 - Mdm10 complex formation ( 20 ) ( Figure 4D ) . Notably , our simulations suggest that Mdm10 displays a hydrophobic mismatch on the cytosolic leaflet of the OMM , which therefore deforms the bilayer around Mdm10 ( Figure 4D ) . The arrangement of the Mdm34 cavity and of the membrane around Mdm10 could facilitate the uptake and release of lipid molecules ( Figure 4D , inset ) . In summary , combining quantitative FM , in situ structural biology and integrative modeling allowed us to seamlessly build a comprehensive and highly resolved model of ER - mitochondria MCS in yeast . In this model , ERMES distributes within MCS as a discrete , two - membranes spanning complex of approximately 188 kDa in mass , with the three ERMES SMP domains arranged into a continuous structure between the two organelles . This organization could represent a controllable trajectory for lipids that differs from the shuttle or tunnel modes identified for other lipid transfer proteins ( 1 ) . The exact mechanism regulating lipid passage through ERMES remains to be determined , but such a 8 mechanism might facilitate specificity or directionality of lipid transport while being compatible with ERMES as an interorganelle tether . Materials and Methods : Yeast cell culture and genetics Liquid Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( budding yeast ) cultures were grown in synthetic complete medium without tryptophan with 2 % glucose ( SC - Trp ) at 25°C for all experiments . Genetic tagging with either EGFP , mNeonGreen or mCherry was done according to ( 32 ) , using plasmids pFA6a - EGFP - HIS3MX6 , pFA6a - mCherry - KanMX and pFA6a - mNeonGreen - HIS3MX6 ( 32 , 33 ) . Yeast strains used for live cell fluorescence microscopy Mdm34 - mNeonGreen , Tom20 - mCherry ( WKY0401 ) : MATa , his3Δ200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , lys2 - 801 , MDM34 - mNEONGREEN : : HIS3MX6 , TOM20 - mCHERRY : : kanMX4 Nuf2 - EGFP ( WKY337 ) : MATα , his3Δ200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , lys2 - 801 , NUF2 - EGFP : : HIS3MX6 Cse4 - EGFP , Tom20 - Cherry ( WKY421 ) : MATα , his3Δ200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , lys2 - 801 , CSE4 - EGFP : : HIS3MX6 , TOM20 - mCHERRY : : kanMX4 Mdm12 - EGFP ( WKY0119 ) : MATα , his3Δ200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , lys2 - 801 , MDM12 - EGFP : : HIS3MX6 Mdm34 - EGFP ( WKY0432 ) : MATα , his3Δ200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , lys2 - 801 , MDM34 - EGFP : : HIS3MX6 Mmm1 - EGFP ( WKY0433 ) : MATα , his3Δ200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , lys2 - 801 , MMM1 - EGFP : : HIS3MX6 Yeast strain used for cryo - CLEM / cryo - ET 9 Mdm34 - mNeonGreen , Dnm1 - mCherry ( WKY0400 ) : MATa , his3Δ200 , leu2 - 3 , 112 , ura3 - 52 , lys2 - 801 , MDM34 - mNEONGREEN : : HIS3MX6 , DNM1 - mCHERRY : : kanMX4 Quantification of the number of ERMES components per MCS Quantification of the number of molecules of ERMES components per diffraction limited puncta was done as in ( 34 ) , according to the protocol described by ( 19 ) . Yeast cells expressing Cse4 - EGFP Tom20 - mCherry were mixed with cells expressing either Mmm1 - EGFP , Mdm12 - EGFP or Mdm34 - EGFP , and then mounted on Concanavalin A coated 1 . 5 glass coverslips . The Tom20 - mCherry signal was used to discriminate cells of the two strains . Stacked images ( 21 images over 4 . 2 μm z - height ) were collected using the central 1024 x 1024 px of a QE80 Hamamatsu camera mounted on a Nikon Ti2 microscope equipped with Nikon Plan Apo VC 100x / 1 . 40 NA oil objective . A NIJI LED light source with 470 nm and 550 nm LEDs was used for excitation with the filter sets 49002 - ET - EGFP ( FITC / Cy2 ) with ET470 / 40x , T495lpxr and ET525 / 50m for green fluorescence and 49005 - ET - DSRed ( TRITX / Cy3 ) with ET545 / 30x , T570lp and ET620 / 60m for red fluorescence . Stacked images were collected of green fluorescence before red fluorescence imaging . Z - stacked images of individual cells ( either expressing one of the ERMES components or Cse4 - EGFP Tom20 - mCherry cells in anaphase - telophase ) were cropped manually using Fiji ( 35 ) and then subjected to the SpotQuant analysis pipeline , which includes background subtraction , identification and masking of fluorescent spots prior to measurement of fluorescence intensity ( 19 ) . The Python3 package SpotQuant was accessed at https : / / github . com / apicco / spotquant . To validate the workflow , the ratio of Nuf2 - EGFP molecules with respect to Cse4 - EGFP molecules was measured and found to be 3 . 5 : 1 , in close agreement with the published ratio of 3 . 6 : 1 ( 36 , 37 ) . Cryo - FIB milling of yeast cells , cryo - CLEM and cryo - ET Log - phase cultures of yeast expressing Mdm34 - mNeonGreen and Dnm1 - mCherry were pelleted and resuspended in SC - Trp with 15 % dextran ( w / v , Sigma 40 kDa Mw ) before applying to glow discharged Quantifoil R2 / 2 Cu 200 mesh grids , manually back blotting and plunging into liquid ethane using a manual plunger with temperature control ( 38 ) . Lamellae of vitrified yeast cells were prepared as described by ( 17 , 39 ) using a Scios DualBeam FIB / SEM microscope ( FEI ) equipped with a Quorum PP3010T cryo - FIB / SEM preparation system . To improve lamellae stability , micro - expansion joints 10 were made ( 40 ) . Cryo - FM imaging of lamellae was done on a Zeiss Axio Imager M2m microscope equipped with a Linkam CMS 196 cryo - stage and an Axiocam 503 mono CCD camera ( Zeiss ) . Bright field images of the grid were collected using an EC Plan - Neofluar 10x / 0 . 30 ( Zeiss ) objective lens . High - magnification fluorescence images of lamellae were collected with a LD EC Epiplan - Neofluar 100x / 0 . 75 DIC M27 ( Zeiss ) objective lens . A Zeiss Colibri 7 LED light source with 475 nm and 555 nm LEDs was used for excitation with the filter sets 38 HE eGFP ( Zeiss ) for green fluorescence ( Mdm34 - mNeonGreen ) and 63 HE mRFP ( Zeiss ) for red fluorescence ( Dnm1 - mCherry ) . Room humidity was kept below approx . 25 % during cryo - FM . Lamellae which contained Mdm34 - mNeonGreen signals were used in the next steps of cryo - ET . Cryo - ET tilt series were collected on a Titan Krios microscope ( Thermo Fisher ) operated at 300 kV using a Quantum energy filter ( slit width 20 eV ) and a K3 direct electron detector ( Gatan ) . SerialEM ( 41 ) was used for acquiring montaged maps of the lamellae and for tilt series acquisition . Low magnification maps ( 39 . 39 Å / px ) were correlated with cryo - FM images by 2D rigid fitting using the Icy plug - in ecCLEM ( 42 ) . As landmarks for registering cryo - FM and cryo - EM images , features of the lamella and yeast cell outlines , as well as holes and imperfections in the surrounding carbon support film which were visible in both cryo - FM and cryo - EM images were used . In this way regions containing Mdm34 - mNeonGreen puncta were identified . In a second step , the resulting composite images were correlated to medium magnification anchor maps ( 10 . 73 Å / px ) , using features recognisable at low and intermediate magnification . The medium magnification maps were used to navigate tilt series acquisition . Tilt series images were acquired at 1° increment over a ±56° range in groups of 4 using a dose - symmetric tilt scheme ( 43 , 44 ) at a pixel size of 2 . 684 Å and a defocus range from - 3 . 5 to - 6 . 0 μm . Total exposure time was adjusted to maintain a total dose per image of 1 . 3 e - / Å using a dose rate of approximately 25 e - / px / s . Exposures were fractionated as four frames acquired as LZW - compressed TIFF images without normalisation and without binning . Tomogram Reconstruction and Subtomogram Averaging Frames were gain corrected , aligned and dose - weighted with the preprocessing script from the subTOM package ( 45 ) which executes IMOD’s alignframes and ctfplotter functions ( 46 ) . Tilt series were aligned using IMOD’s etomo with patch tracking and 2D CTF correction applied by phase - flipping in IMOD . Tomograms were reconstructed at bin 2 using etomo by either weighted back - projection for subtomogram averaging or simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique ( SIRT ) for tomograms used for manual coordinate picking of the bridges’ ER and OMM anchor points , segmentations and for 11 figures . Bridge structures were manually picked using Dynamo ( 47 ) as dipole models of ER and OMM anchor points . The central point and axis between ER and OMM anchor points were used to define the coordinates for subtomogram extraction using the subTOM package which utilizes MATLAB ( MathWorks ) functions adapted from TOM ( 48 ) , AV3 ( 49 , 50 ) , and Dynamo ( 47 ) . The presented STA consists of 1098 subtomograms , extracted from 51 tomograms acquired at regions of lamella corresponding to ERMES puncta imaged by cryo - FM . See Supplementary Figure S3 for a schematic of the STA procedure . For initial template generation , a random spin rotation was applied to each subtomogram to minimise the effect of the preferential missing wedge upon subtomogram alignment . Subtomogram alignment was inspected between alignment iterations using the UCSF Chimera ( 51 ) plug - in Place Object ( 52 ) . Subtomograms which aligned poorly and instead ‘migrated’ to align to the ER or OMM membranes , were found by visually inspecting the position of the average STA map placed at the positions of the subvolumes within each tomogram . These misaligned subtomograms were removed from the list of subtomogram positions used for STA before the subTOM analysis was re - run . The resolution of the resulting STA map was estimated to be 29 Å from the Fourier Shell Correlation curve at 0 . 143 , generated according to ( 53 ) , implemented through subTOM ( 45 ) ( Supplementary Figure S4A ) . For this analysis , the STA map was masked ( Supplementary Figure S4B ) . Analysis of the angle between bridge and OMM STA was used to align the subtomograms composing the bridge STA map to the OMM . The zenith rotational angle was compared between these two alignments to obtain the angle between the z - axis of the bridge STA map relative to the normal of the OMM . For this alignment , the subtomograms aligned before ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) were repositioned so that the OMM - proximal end of the bridge was centred at the pivot point of the STA alignment search . The subtomograms were masked to include the OMM and a part of the bridge ( Supplementary Figure S5C ) . The alignment search consisted of 5° zenith tilt - steps , from 0 - 60° , without in - plane rotation . The differences in zenith rotation of each subtomogram before and after this alignment were calculated in MATLAB ( Mathworks ) analyzed in R . Nearest neighbor analysis For the nearest neighbour analysis , the Euclidean distances between all the centers of subtomograms were calculated with MATLAB ( Mathworks ) , and for each subtomogram the minimal distance was identified as the one to the nearest neighbor . For determining the distance to the nearest neighbor of the 12 ER and OMM anchor points , subtomograms were first re - centered on the ER or OMM anchor points , respectively , and the Euclidean distances to the nearest neighbors were determined as for the centers . Numerical data analysis Data was analyzed using MATLAB ( Mathworks ) and R ( R Core Team , 2021 ) . For figure panels , the data was plotted using ggplot2 ( 54 ) and raincloud plots ( 55 ) . Segmentation and ultrastructure analysis Segmentation models of mitochondrial membranes , ER and peroxisomes were drawn manually in IMOD ( 46 ) and rendered for figure preparation in UCSF ChimeraX ( 56 ) . To determine the surface area of the contact site , the ER membrane in proximity to the OMM was segmented in IMOD and its surface area was measured using imodinfo ( 46 ) . The UCSF Chimera ( 51 ) plug - in Place Object ( 52 ) was used to place back the average map into tomographic coordinates and determine the number of ERMES bridges per surface area . For display of the STA average , the map was rendered in UCSF ChimeraX ( 56 ) . Structural model and fitting For structure prediction , the sequences were modified as follows . Mmm1 : Truncated the ER - interacting N - terminal side after the helical segment ( residues : 1 - 161 ) , as in the crystal structure ( 16 ) ( PDB ID : 5YK6 ) . Mdm12 : based on the structure from ( 25 ) , the used sequence comprises only part of the loop between residues 73 and 115 , adding 5 residues to each side of the broken loop ( 73 - 78 ) and ( 110 - 115 ) . The loop has been shown to not be necessary for function ( 25 ) . Mdm34 : Only residues 1 - 200 were used , corresponding to the SMP domain . The C - terminal part is expected to be partially disordered based on secondary structure prediction and its interaction with the rest of the complex is currently unknown . Mdm10 : Three regions facing the intermembrane space and one facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane are likely disordered or partially disordered and were not included in the used sequence ( residues 95 - 127 , 219 - 224 , 323 - 406 , 452 - 473 ) . None of the removed loop regions is expected to strongly affect the overall architecture of the model or is interacting with other modeled subunits ( 25 , 57 ) . 13 The ERMES complex structure was predicted by combining three dimer predictions ( Mmm1 / Mdm12 , Mdm12 / Mdm34 , Mdm34 / Mdm10 ) using the FoldDock ( FD ) protocol ( 26 ) . We combined the predictions by aligning the common subunits of the predictions . To account for the different conformations adopted by Mdm34 in the Mdm12 / Mdm34 and Mdm34 / Mdm10 predictions , we performed a Targeted Molecular Dynamics simulation and changed the conformation of part of the subunit to match both interfaces . The simulation was performed using Mdm34 from the Mdm10 / Mdm34 predicted structure , using implicit Generalized Born solvent ( e = 80 ) , added secondary structure restraints , and maintaining the regions interfacing with Mdm10 restrained to their initial positions with a harmonic force constant of 2 kcal mol - 1 Å - 2 on the residues 1 - 31 , 75 - 130 , 147 - 152 . The simulation was performed using Charmm36m force - field parameters ( 58 ) Langevin dynamics at T = 310 K and a time step of 1 fs . The combination of the predictions from FD by aligning the central subunits ( e . g . Mmm1 / Mdm12 - Mdm12 / Mdm34 ) results in a roughly linear arrangement of subunits . In addition to FD , we performed structural prediction using Alphafold - Multimer ( 27 , 59 ) . The dimeric structures are predicted in the same head - to - tail conformation , yielding an overall similar architecture . Interestingly , the FD structure shows a larger aperture at the Mdm12 / Mdm34 interface ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) , possibly highlighting conformational changes that could promote lipid transport . A total of 4 POPE lipids were included in the Mmm1 / Mdm12 / Mdm34 complex ( 2 : 1 : 1 ) using lipid structures from the resolved crystal structures ( where available ) or added by similarity with other subunits . The complex ( through Mdm10 ) was embedded in a POPC : POPE : POPI ( 50 : 35 : 15 ) membrane resembling an Outer Mitochondrial Membrane ( OMM ) - like composition ( 60 ) , and solvated with TIP3P water . Sodium and chloride ions were added to give an ionic strength of approximately 120 mM . The total system size comprised approximately 330 , 000 atoms . The membrane system was prepared using Charmm - GUI ( 61 ) . All simulations were performed using Charmm36m force - field parameters and an NPT ensemble with P = 1 atm , and Langevin dynamics at T = 310 K . The time step was set to 1 fs , and long - range electrostatics treated by the Particle Mesh Ewald ( PME ) method . After initial equilibration of the membrane ( 30 ns ) while maintaining the protein restrained to its initial position , we biased the structure obtained with FD using a Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting 14 approach ( MDFF ) ( 62 ) and extended the simulation to 120 ns . The densities obtained from the experiments were used to generate a grid potential with a voxel size of 5 . 368 Å derived from the STA map . The density was trimmed and centered to contain only the region of interest . Additionally , we partially reduced the noise of the map by applying a gaussian filter . The grid - based potential was applied in the simulation to Mmm1 , Mdm12 , and the solvent - exposed region of Mdm34 . We performed multiple tests to choose a suitable biasing potential ( gscale 0 . 1 / 0 . 05 / 0 . 02 kcal mol - 1 , Supplemental Figure S7 ) . The scaling factor ( g _ scale ) determines the weight of the experimental STA map on the total molecular potential . We find that a value of 0 . 02 kcal mol - 1 consolidates the accuracy of the density and the conformational changes induced by the application of the external potential . All the simulations were performed using NAMD Git2021 - 11 - 23 with CUDA acceleration ( 63 ) . Analyses and system preparation were performed using VMD ( 64 ) and ChimeraX ( 58 ) . Cavity detection was performed using CAVER 3 . 0 ( 65 ) with standard parameters set .
