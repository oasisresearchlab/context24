Moreover , altered regulation of the neuronal actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases such as autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Myosin XVI is a neuronally expressed unconventional myosin known to bind the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) , a regulator of ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) polymerization . Notably , the gene encoding the myosin’s heavy chain ( MYO16 ) shows genetic association with neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD . Here , we investigated whether myosin XVI plays a role for actin cytoskeleton regulation in the dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells ( PCs ) , a neuronal cell type crucial for motor learning , social cognition and vocalization . We provide evidence that both myosin XVI and the WRC component WAVE1 localize to PC spines . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analysis of GFP - actin in cultured PCs shows that Myo16 knockout as well as PC - speciﬁc Myo16 knockdown , lead to faster F - actin turnover in the dendritic spines of PCs . We also detect accelerated F - actin turnover upon interference with the WRC , and upon inhibition of Arp2 / 3 that drives formation of branched F - actin downstream of the WRC . In contrast , inhibition of formins that are responsible for polymerization of linear actin ﬁlaments does not cause faster F - actin turnover . Together , our data establish myosin XVI as a regulator of the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton and suggest that it is an upstream activator of the WRC - Arp2 / 3 pathway in PC spines . Furthermore , ultra - structural and electrophysiological analyses of Myo16 knockout cerebellum reveals the presence of reduced numbers of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic terminals in the absence of the myosin . Therefore , we here deﬁne myosin XVI as an F - actin regulator important for presynaptic organization in the cerebellum .

Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines INTRODUCTION Synaptic development , function and plasticity depend on a functional neuronal actin cytoskeleton ( Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ; Hotulainen and Hoogenraad , 2010 ; Konietzny et al . , 2017 ) . F - actin is enriched at presynaptic terminals and within postsynaptic dendritic spines , small cellular protrusions on which excitatory synapses are found ( Matus et al . , 1982 ; Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ; Honkura et al . , 2008 ; Korobova and Svitkina , 2010 ; Rust and Maritzen , 2015 ) . F - actin comprises a meshwork of branched and linear ﬁlaments and provides structural support to dendritic spines . Moreover , it serves as track for actin - based myosin motors , some of which deliver cargos needed for postsynaptic plasticity ( Wagner et al . , 2011a ; Kneussel and Wagner , 2013 ) . A large fraction of the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines is highly dynamic and undergoes continuous turnover ( “treadmilling” ) , i . e . , cycles of nucleation of new ﬁlaments , their elongation by polymerization , ﬁlament severing and depolymerization ( Star et al . , 2002 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Chazeau and Giannone , 2016 ; Konietzny et al . , 2017 ) . Importantly , the regulation of actin dynamics appears to be fundamental for processes associated with learning and memory such as structural and functional synaptic plasticity ( Matus , 2000 ; Honkura et al . , 2008 ; Kasai et al . , 2010 ; MacGillavry et al . , 2013 ; Rust and Maritzen , 2015 ; Hlushchenko et al . , 2016 ; Basu and Lamprecht , 2018 ; Borovac et al . , 2018 ) . Myosin XVI is a neuronally expressed , vertebrate - speciﬁc unconventional myosin ( Patel et al . , 2001 ; Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ; Cameron et al . , 2013 ) . There are indications that the myosin might be involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation . The myosin XVI heavy chain ( MYO16 , also known as NYAP3 ) is an F - actin - binding protein with an N - terminal ankyrin repeat domain that binds protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunits , followed by a myosin motor domain that , in mammals , is likely impaired in its ability to hydrolyze ATP ( Patel et al . , 2001 ; Cameron et al . , 2007 ; Kengyel et al . , 2015 ) . Via its tail domain , MYO16 binds phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) and the WRC , an upstream regulator of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin ﬁlament nucleation ( Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) . MYO16 / NYAP3 and two proteins that resemble the myosin’s tail domain ( NYAP1 , NYAP2 ) are thought to function redundantly via bridging WRC - PI3K association in order to regulate neurite outgrowth ( Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) . Notably , both WRC and Arp2 / 3 are key factors that drive actin dynamics in hippocampal dendritic spines ( Spence and Soderling , 2015 ; Chazeau and Giannone , 2016 ) . The WRC constitutes a heteropentameric complex consisting of WAVE1 ( or its orthologs WAVE2 , WAVE3 ) , CYFIP1 ( also known as SRA1 ; or its ortholog CYFIP2 / PIR121 ) , NCKAP1 ( also known as NAP1 , HEM2 ; or its ortholog HEM1 ) , ABI1 ( or its orthologs ABI2 , ABI3 ) and HSPC300 ( also known as BRICK1 ) ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Bisi et al . , 2013 ) . Activation of the WRC is a multistep process that involves binding to the small GTPase Rac1 , and results in exposure of the VCA domain of WAVE ( Lebensohn and Kirschner , 2009 ; Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Once exposed , the VCA domain binds and activates Arp2 / 3 . The seven subunit Arp2 / 3 complex catalyzes the nucleation of new ﬁlaments from the side of pre - existing ones , thereby promoting formation of a branched F - actin meshwork ( Rotty et al . , 2013 ) . Genetic approaches demonstrated the importance of WRC - and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics for synaptic structure and function . Ablation of WRC components leads to abnormal F - actin turnover in hippocampal spines and to changes in spine density and morphology ( Grove et al . , 2004 ; Kim Y . et al . , 2006 ; Hazai et al . , 2013 ; Pathania et al . , 2014 ; Njoo et al . , 2015 ) . Loss of WAVE1 furthermore causes deﬁcits in synaptic plasticity , learning , and memory ( Soderling et al . , 2003 , 2007 ) . Moreover , genetic disruption of Arp2 / 3 alters F - actin dynamics in hippocampal spines , structural spine plasticity , and AMPA receptor recruitment into synapses ( Hotulainen et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ; Spence et al . , 2016 ) . Many more factors are known that control actin dynamics in hippocampal spines and impact synaptic plasticity , including further Arp2 / 3 regulators ( Mikhaylova et al . , 2018 ; Parkinson et al . , 2018 ) , non - muscle myosin IIb ( Rex et al . , 2010 ; Koskinen et al . , 2014 ) , and post - translational modiﬁcation of actin subunits ( Bertling et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , formins have been detected at the tip of ﬁnger - like protrusions growing out from hippocampal spine heads ( Hotulainen et al . , 2009 ; Chazeau et al . , 2014 ) . Similar to Arp2 / 3 , formins drive de novo formation of actin ﬁlaments that are , however , linear and lead to the formation of elongated protrusions such as ﬁlopodia . Interestingly , several genes linked to an increased risk of developing ASD encode actin regulators ( Joensuu et al . , 2018 ) . This includes the genes encoding WRC components CYFIP1 and NCKAP1 , two established myosin XVI protein interaction partners ( Wang et al . , 2009 ; Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ; Chang et al . , 2013 ; Joensuu et al . , 2018 ) . ASD is a complex neuropsychiatric disease characterized by deﬁcits in social interaction and communication , with motor coordination problems as a frequent comorbidity ( Wang et al . , 2014 ; de la Torre - Ubieta et al . , 2016 ) . Strikingly , ASD - like phenotypes in mouse models can be reverted by manipulating actin regulators ( Dolan et al . , 2013 ; Duﬀney et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , it has been suggested that alterations in F - actin dynamics are one of the important pathological features in ASD ( Spence and Soderling , 2015 ; Lin et al . , 2016 ; Yan et al . , 2016 ; Borovac et al . , 2018 ; Hlushchenko et al . , 2018 ; Joensuu et al . , 2018 ) . Notably , genetic evidence links also MYO16 to an increased risk of developing ASD ( Wang et al . , 2009 ; Chang et al . , 2013 ; Liu et al . , 2015 ) and other neuropsychiatric disorders ( Rodriguez - Murillo et al . , 2014 ; Kao et al . , 2016 ) . MYO16 occurs in cerebellar PCs ( Patel et al . , 2001 ; Cameron et al . , 2013 ) , central signal integrators that provide the only output from the cerebellar cortex . Their dendrites project into the cerebellar molecular layer and receive excitatory synaptic input via dendritic spines from axons termed PFs ( granule cell axons ) and climbing ﬁbers ( CFs ) . PCs are crucial for motor coordination and motor learning ( Ito , 2001 ; Schonewille et al . , 2010 ) . However , recent research demonstrates that PCs are also important for social cognition , language and vocalization ( Tsai et al . , 2012 ; Fujita - Jimbo and Momoi , 2014 ; Peter et al . , 2016 ; Sokolov et al . , 2017 ) . Interestingly , malfunction of the cerebellum and PCs has been linked to ASD and ASD - like phenotypes in mice ( Wang et al . , 2014 ; de la Torre - Ubieta et al . , 2016 ) . For example , Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 3 Roesler et al . Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines PC - speciﬁc knockout of ASD genes Shank2 or Tsc1 causes social interaction deﬁcits in mice ( Tsai et al . , 2012 ; Peter et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , cerebellar PCs appear to be a highly relevant cell type for studying the role of ASD - related genes such as Myo16 . Notably , little is known about F - actin regulation in the dendritic spines of PCs , compared to hippocampal neurons . PCs express WRC components , the formin Daam1 , and the Arp2 / 3 - formin coordinator MTSS1 ( Soderling et al . , 2003 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; Kawabata Galbraith et al . , 2018 ) . However , whether and how the WRC , Arp2 / 3 , and formins aﬀect F - actin turnover in PC spines has not been examined directly . Remarkably , PCs also harbor speciﬁc F - actin regulators such as espin and delphilin that are not found in other neurons ( Miyagi et al . , 2002 ; Sekerkova et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , actin dynamics might be regulated in a unique manner in PC dendritic spines . The aim of the present study was to obtain insight into the role of myosin XVI in neuronal cells . Given the known interaction of MYO16 with the actin regulator WRC , and considering that several genes associated with ASD encode actin regulators , we hypothesized that myosin XVI is involved in regulating dendritic spine F - actin and , possibly , synaptic structure and function . RESULTS Generation and Initial Characterization of Myo16 Knockout Mice To investigate the role of MYO16 in the brain , we generated two mouse lines that carry constitutive Myo16 knockout alleles ( Myo16 em 2 , Myo16 em 3 ; Figures 1A , B ) . Western blot analyses conﬁrmed the absence of myosin XVI heavy chain in homozygous Myo16 − / − mice of both lines ( Figure 1C ) . Since Myo16 is expressed in cerebellum ( Patel et al . , 2001 ; Cameron et al . , 2007 ; see also Figure 1C ) , we examined the anatomical organization of this structure in Myo16 − / − knockout mice . Nissl staining of cerebellar sections did not reveal gross abnormalities regarding foliation and the organization of layers ( Figure 1D ) . Moreover , immuno - ﬂuorescence labeling for the presynaptic marker VGLUT1 did not expose gross deﬁcits in terms of presence of PF terminals in the molecular layer ( Figure 1E ) . Given the genetic association of MYO16 with ASD , we also examined the in situ localization of Shank2 and neuroligin - 2 , two proteins that are strongly linked to ASD and that form postsynaptic clusters at excitatory and inhibitory synapses of PCs , respectively ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ; Ha et al . , 2016 ; Peter et al . , 2016 ) . Quantiﬁcation of Shank2 clusters ( Figure 1F ) and neuroligin - 2 clusters ( Figure 1G ) within the cerebellar molecular layer showed that cluster density is unaltered in the absence of myosin XVI . Finally , we characterized protein levels and subcellular distribution of postsynaptic molecules in Myo16 − / − knockout cerebellum ( Figures 1H , I ) . We focused on excitatory synapse proteins ( AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2 , scaﬀolding molecule PSD - 95 ) and on inhibitory synapse proteins ( GABA A receptor subunit α 1 , neuroligin - 2 ) . All of these proteins are present in cerebellum , including postsynaptically in PCs ( Briatore et al . , 2010 ; Yamasaki et al . , 2011 ; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . Using diﬀerential fractionation of cerebellar extracts , we generated a crude extract ( S1 ) , a membrane - enriched fraction ( P2 ) and a fraction enriched for synaptosomal proteins ( SYP ) ( Figure 1H ) . Quantiﬁcation of GluA1 , GluA2 , PSD - 95 , GABA A α 1 , and neuroligin - 2 amounts showed that the levels of these synaptic proteins in S1 , P2 , and SYP fractions are not signiﬁcantly changed in the absence of myosin XVI , compared to littermate control ( Figure 1I ) . Together , this indicates that gross anatomical organization , as well as expression and localization of selected synaptic proteins , are unaltered in the cerebellum of Myo16 knockout mice . Myosin XVI Localizes to Purkinje Cell Dendritic Spines In order to obtain insight into the subcellular locations at which endogenous myosin XVI might act , we determined its distribution using fractionation of cerebellar extracts ( Figure 2A ) . MYO16 was detected in crude extracts ( S1 ) , but also in the membrane - enriched and synaptosomal fractions ( P2 , SYP ) , suggesting the possibility that the myosin localizes at or close to synapses . Successful enrichment of membranes and synaptosomes in P2 and SYP fractions was veriﬁed via PSD - 95 enrichment and loss of tubulin subunit alpha - Tubulin - 4A ( Figure 2A ) . Since MYO16 is present in cerebellar PCs ( Patel et al . , 2001 ; Cameron et al . , 2007 ) , we further examined its subcellular location in this cell type . We made use of heterogeneous cerebellar cultures transfected with PC - speciﬁc expression plasmids as described ( Wagner et al . , 2011b ) ( see section “Materials and Methods” ) . Observation of live PCs expressing a red - ﬂuorescent cell volume marker and GFP - tagged myosin XVI heavy chain ( GFP - MYO16 ) showed that the myosin accumulates in essentially all dendritic spines ( Figures 2B , C ) . Time - lapse movies of PC dendrites revealed that the GFP - MYO16 clusters change their shape over time ( Supplementary Movie S1 ) . These dynamic morphology changes were reminiscent of F - actin in the dendritic spines of live PCs ( Figures 2D , E ; see also Supplementary Movie S2 ) , as visualized via F - tractin ( Johnson and Schell , 2009 ) . Indeed , GFP - MYO16 and F - tractin co - localized in spines of live PCs ( Figure 2F ; see also Supplementary Movie S3 ) . Thus , the myosin XVI heavy chain localizes to the postsynaptic , F - actin rich spines of cerebellar PCs . Purkinje Cell Spine F - Actin Turnover Is Faster in the Absence of Myosin XVI Given the localization of MYO16 to PC spines , combined with the known ability of the myosin to bind the WRC ( Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) , we wondered whether the myosin is involved in regulating actin polymerization in spines . In order to monitor F - actin turnover in dendritic spines of Myo16 − / − PCs , the beta isoform of actin was tagged with monomeric GFP ( GFP - actin ) and expressed in cultured PCs . GFP - actin is widely used to monitor F - actin dynamics and turnover in hippocampal and cortical spines ( e . g . , Star et al . , 2002 ; Okamoto et al . , 2007 ; Hotulainen et al . , 2009 ; Rex et al . , 2010 ; Koskinen et al . , 2012 , 2014 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ; Chazeau et al . , 2015 ; Chen et al . , 2015 ) . As anticipated , GFP - actin accumulated in the spines of live PCs ( Figure 3A ) .

To verify that FRAP of GFP - actin reveals the turnover of actin ﬁlaments in PC spines ( as opposed to diﬀusion of GFP - actin monomers into spines ) , cells were treated with the F - actin stabilizing drug jasplakinolide ( 1 µ M ) ( Bubb et al . , 1994 ; Cramer , 1999 ) . As expected , while GFP - actin ﬂuorescence recovered in spines of vehicle - treated cells following bleaching , recovery was almost entirely blocked upon jasplakinolide treatment ( Figure 3B ) . This conﬁrms that the observed ﬂuorescence recovery reﬂects formation of new F - actin in PC spines . To determine whether myosin XVI is required for F - actin turnover , we performed FRAP analysis of GFP - actin in spines of Myo16 − / − PCs ( Myo16 em 2 allele ; Figure 3C ) . The plateau of ﬂuorescence recovery indicates the fraction of F - actin that undergoes turnover ( referred to as the mobile F - actin pool ) , while the recovery time constant ( τ ) is a measure of F - actin turnover rate in spines ( Star et al . , 2002 ) . Our analyses did not reveal a signiﬁcant diﬀerence regarding the mobile pool of spine F - actin when comparing Myo16 − / − to wild - type littermate PCs ( 71 vs . 67 % , respectively ; Figure 3D ) . However , F - actin turnover rate was signiﬁcantly faster ( i . e . , τ was smaller ) in Myo16 − / − PC spines compared to control ( τ = 23 s vs . τ = 32 s , respectively ; Figure 3E ) . We independently conﬁrmed these results using PCs from the knockout mouse line carrying the Myo16 em 3 allele ( Figures 3F , G ) . Therefore , F - actin turnover in PC spines is accelerated upon Myo16 knockout . Since the actin cytoskeleton is a crucial determinant of spine shape ( Hotulainen and Hoogenraad , 2010 ) , we also monitored whether overall morphology and dynamics of spines are changed in Myo16 − / − PCs . Using images of unbleached spines recorded during the GFP - actin FRAP experiments , a spine circularity index was determined as a measure for spine shape ( Figure 3H ) . Moreover , we monitored spine area ( an indirect measure of spine size ; Figure 3I ) , relative spine area size changes over 2 . 5 min ( Figure 3J ) , and relative changes of actin ﬂuorescence intensity in spines over time ( Figure 3K ) . None of these parameters were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in Myo16 − / − PCs when compared to wild - type . Thus , overall morphology and dynamics of PC spines appear to be normal in the absence of myosin XVI . Myosin XVI Acts Within Purkinje Cells to Regulate Spine F - Actin Turnover Myosin XVI might aﬀect F - actin turnover directly via acting in PC spines . Alternatively , altered F - actin dynamics in Myo16 − / − PCs might be of non - cell autonomous origin such as altered presynaptic input from granule cells . Thus , to determine whether the myosin is required within PCs , we performed PC - speciﬁc Myo16 knockdown . First , we identiﬁed RNAi sequences that , when embedded in a miR backbone , knockdown Myo16 expression ( Figure 4A ) . Compared to control levels , the independent knockdown sequences Myo16 KD3 and Myo16 KD5 signiﬁcantly reduced GFP - MYO16 expression to 33 % and 28 % , respectively ( Figure 4B ) . Following a previously used strategy ( Alexander and Hammer , 2016 ) , these knockdown sequences as well as a reporter ( FusionRed ) were placed under control of the L7 / Pcp - 2 promoter ( Figure 4C ) which drives PC - speciﬁc expression in cerebellar cultures ( Wagner et al . , 2011b ) . Expression of the Myo16 KD3 , Myo16 KD5 or scrambled miR knockdown constructs in the analyzed PCs was veriﬁed via monitoring FusionRed . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of GFP - actin showed that , similar to the situation in Myo16 − / − PCs , the two independent PC - speciﬁc Myo16 knockdown constructs both caused a signiﬁcantly faster turnover of F - actin in spines compared to scrambled control ( Myo16 KD3 , τ = 21 s ; Myo16 KD5 , τ = 19 s ; Scrambled , τ = 28 s ) , while the mobile pool of F - actin remained unchanged ( Figures 4D – G ) . Moreover , as in case of Myo16 − / − PCs , no consistent changes in terms of overall morphology and dynamics of spines were observed upon Myo16 knockdown ( Figures 4H – K ) . Therefore , both global Myo16 knockout and PC - speciﬁc Myo16 knockdown lead to an identical phenotype , i . e . , accelerated F - actin turnover in PC - spines . Since GFP - MYO16 targets to PC spines ( Figure 2 ) , this indicates that the myosin functions at the postsynaptic side to attenuate spine F - actin turnover . Faster F - Actin Turnover in Purkinje Cell Spines Upon WRC Inhibition The WRC is an activator of Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin polymerization ( Bisi et al . , 2013 ) and a well - established interaction partner of myosin XVI ( Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we asked whether also the WRC is important for actin cytoskeleton dynamics in dendritic spines of PCs . We ﬁrst determined whether the WRC - subunit WAVE1 localizes to PC spines in situ . We employed an anti - WAVE1 antibody that detects a band of expected size in cerebellar extracts ( Figure 5A ) . Immuno - ﬂuorescence labeling of wild - type cerebellum conﬁrmed ( Soderling et al . , 2003 ) the presence of WAVE1 in PCs and revealed partial co - localization with PC spines ( Figure 5B ) . Immuno - electron microscopy showed that WAVE1 is present at pre - and postsynaptic sites within the cerebellar molecular layer ( Figure 5C , Myo16 + / + panels ) . In spines , predominantly the postsynaptic density was labeled ( Figure 5C , left Myo16 + / + panel ) . In cerebellum of Myo16 − / − mice , no obvious diﬀerence in WAVE1 labelling was observed ( Figure 5C , Myo16 − / − panels ) . Thus , WAVE1 is present in PC spines , and myosin XVI is not essential for WAVE1 targeting to spines . To interfere with WRC function , we made use of a well - characterized dominant - negative version of WAVE1 that lacks the C - terminal VCA domain ( WAVE1 (cid:49) VCA ) and thus is unable to activate Arp2 / 3 ( Miki et al . , 1998 ; Kim H . J . et al . , 2006 ; Pils et al . , 2012 ) . To selectively target the PCs in heterogeneous cerebellar culture , WAVE1 (cid:49) VCA was expressed under control of the L7 / Pcp - 2 promoter . GFP - actin FRAP analysis revealed that WAVE1 (cid:49) VCA leads to a signiﬁcantly smaller mobile F - actin pool in PC spines ( FRED - WAVE1 (cid:49) VCA : Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 7 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 8 Roesler et al .

Moreover , the mobile pool displayed faster turnover ( FRED - WAVE1 (cid:49) VCA , τ = 27 s ; FRED control , τ = 32 s ; Figure 6C ) . Therefore , interference with the WRC within PCs phenocopies both Myo16 knockout and knockdown in accelerating F - actin turnover in spines . Analyses of PCs expressing GFP - actin showed furthermore that WAVE1 (cid:49) VCA leads to changes in spine morphology . Compared to control , spines of PCs that express WAVE1 (cid:49) VCA were more elongated and larger ( Figures 6D , E , H ; see also Supplementary Movies S5 , S6 ) .

This indicates that the WRC promotes circular spine shape and favors spine dynamics in PCs . Arp2 / 3 Inhibition , but Not Formin Inhibition , Accelerates F - Actin Turnover in PC Spines Since Arp2 / 3 is the downstream target of the WRC ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Bisi et al . , 2013 ) , reduced Arp2 / 3 activation might be the cause of accelerated F - actin turnover upon WRC inhibition ( Figure 6C ) . To determine whether Arp2 / 3 plays a role for F - actin turnover in PC spines , cells were acutely exposed to CK - 666 , a well - established small molecule inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 ( Nolen et al . , 2009 ) , before performing FRAP analysis of GFP - actin ( Figure 7A ) . Similar as for WRC inhibition , spines of PCs treated with 200 µ M CK - 666 displayed a signiﬁcantly smaller mobile F - actin pool ( CK - 666 , plateau at 43 % ; vehicle control , plateau at 65 % ; Figures 7B , C ) . Moreover , like when interfering with the WRC or with myosin XVI , turnover of the mobile F - actin pool was signiﬁcantly faster upon CK - 666 treatment ( CK - 666 , τ = 20 s ; vehicle control , τ = 30 s ; Figure 7D ) . Together , our data indicate that the WRC - Arp2 / 3 pathway determines the relative level of mobile F - actin in PC spines and attenuates its turnover time . We next tested whether also manipulation of actin polymerization factors unrelated to Arp2 / 3 results in accelerated F - actin turnover in PC spines . For this purpose , cells were acutely treated with SMIFH2 ( 40 µ M ) , an inhibitor of formin - mediated actin ﬁlament nucleation and elongation ( Rizvi et al . , 2009 ) . Similar to interference with WRC - Arp2 / 3 , this led to a signiﬁcantly smaller mobile F - actin pool compared to vehicle control ( SMIFH2 , plateau at 40 % ; Figures 7B , C ) . Thus , formin activity is required for F - actin dynamics in PC spines . Notably , however , the turnover time of the dynamic pool was not reduced compared to control ( SMIFH2 , τ = 29 s ; Figure 7D ) . Moreover , the eﬀects of CK - 666 and SMIFH2 on mobile pool size of F - actin were additive , with both blockers leading to a signiﬁcantly reduced plateau compared to CK - 666 alone ( CK - 666 + SMIFH2 , plateau at 30 % ; Figure 7C ) . Therefore , WRC - Arp2 / 3 and formins appear to act in parallel pathways inﬂuencing F - actin dynamics in PC spines , with WRC - Arp2 / 3 – but not formins – attenuating F - actin turnover rate . Since myosin XVI attenuates F - actin turnover rate in PC spines ( Figures 3 , 4 ) and binds to the WRC ( Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) , the myosin might act through the WRC - Arp2 / 3 pathway . If this is the case , Myo16 knockout may not have an additive eﬀect on actin dynamics upon Arp2 / 3 inhibition . Indeed , neither the mobile pool of spine F - actin nor its turnover rate was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in spines of CK - 666 - treated Myo16 − / − PCs when compared to CK - 666 - treated littermate , wild - type PCs ( Figures 7E , F ) . This argues for myosin XVI regulating F - actin turnover rate in PC spines via Arp2 / 3 . Finally , we examined whether acute exposure to the Arp2 / 3 or formin inhibitors changes overall spine morphology or dynamics ( Figures 7G – O ) . Similar to WRC inhibition ( Figure 6D ) or long - term ( 24 h ) treatment with CK - 666 ( Kawabata Galbraith et al . , 2018 ) , short - term Arp2 / 3 inhibition led to a signiﬁcantly more elongated spine shape ( Figure 7G ) . Moreover , CK - 666 treatment resulted in increased spine size ( Figure 7H ) . Size changes of PC spines or actin intensity changes in spines over 2 . 5 min were not signiﬁcantly aﬀected by Arp2 / 3 inhibition ( Figures 7I , J ) . This indicates that the WRC - Arp2 / 3 pathway promotes a circular spine shape in PCs , consistent with Arp2 / 3 driving the formation of a non - uniformly oriented , branched actin meshwork ( Chazeau and Giannone , 2016 ) . In contrast , acute formin inhibition aﬀected PC spine morphology and dynamics diﬀerently ( Figures 7K – O ) . Unlike CK - 666 , SMIFH2 did not lead to spine elongation ( Figure 7K ) but signiﬁcantly reduced relative spine size changes and actin ﬂuorescence intensity changes in spines over time ( Figures 7M , N ) . Similar to CK - 666 treatment , PC spines adopted a larger area upon exposure to SMIFH2 ( Figure 7L ) . Therefore , unlike Arp2 / 3 , formin activity is needed to promote ﬂuctuations of PC spine size and actin content . Altered Synaptic Structure and Transmission in the Cerebellum of Myo16 Knockout Mice Having established that myosin XVI regulates actin dynamics in cerebellar PCs , we examined in more detail whether synapses formed on PC spines are structurally altered in Myo16 − / − mice in situ . First , using electron microscopy images of the middle third of the molecular layer , we quantiﬁed the number of asymmetric synapses per µ m 2 ( Figure 8A ) . No diﬀerence in the density of these excitatory synapses that mainly represent PF - PC synapses was detected . Consistent with the ﬁnding that spine size of cultured Myo16 − / − PCs is unaltered ( Figure 3I ) , also spine head area of molecular layer synapses measured from electron microscopy images was unaltered ( Figures 8B , C ) .

Data points represent analyzed PCs , mean ± SEM is indicated ( magenta ) ; p value determined using Student’s t - test . ( E ) Model of the role of myosin XVI at PF - PC synapses . In PC dendritic spines , myosin XVI is required for the attenuation of F - actin turnover . We propose that the myosin functions by promoting WRC activation which , in turn , activates Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched F - actin formation . In addition to WRC and Arp2 / 3 , also formins promote F - actin mobility in PC spines . However , interference with myosin XVI , WRC , and Arp2 / 3 , but not with formins , accelerates F - actin turnover rate , consistent with formins acting in a separate pathway . At the presynaptic side , loss of myosin XVI leads to reduced numbers of synaptic vesicles and terminals of apparently reduced size . This may be a consequence ( i ) of a role of the myosin at the presynaptic side ( e . g . , in F - actin turnover ) or ( ii ) of the postsynaptic changes in Myo16 − / − PCs . ∗ p < 0 . 05 ; ∗∗ p < 0 . 01 ; ∗∗∗ p < 0 . 001 ; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0 . 0001 ; n . s . , not signiﬁcant . in the absence of myosin XVI might aﬀect the function of PF - PC synapses . To test whether Myo16 knockout alters synaptic transmission onto PCs , we measured spontaneous AMPA receptor - mediated mEPSCs from PCs in acute cerebellar slices ( Figure 9A ) . No diﬀerence in the peak amplitude of mEPSCs was observed when comparing Myo16 − / − and wild - type littermate PCs ( Figure 9B ) , suggesting that synaptic AMPA receptor content is unchanged . In contrast , the mEPSC inter - event interval was signiﬁcantly longer in Myo16 − / − PCs ( Figure 9B ) . Such a reduced frequency of mEPSCs may arise from a reduced number of synapses formed on the PCs . However , no gross abnormalities in dendritic arborization of the analyzed PCs was observed ( Figure 9C ) . Moreover , spine density on Myo16 − / − PCs was unaltered ( Figure 9D ) , and the density of excitatory molecular layer synapses was unchanged in Myo16 − / − cerebellum ( Figure 8A ) . Therefore , the increase in mEPSC inter - event interval provides further support for a reduced number Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 14 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 15 Roesler et al .

Myo16 Knockout Mice Show Comparable Performance to Controls in Motor - and Social Interaction - Tests Given the synaptic roles of myosin XVI identiﬁed so far ( Figure 9E ) , we examined whether Myo16 − / − mice display behavioral abnormalities . In the open ﬁeld test ( Figure 10A ) , Myo16 − / − mice were indistinguishable from wild - type littermate controls in terms of locomotor activity ( total distance moved , velocity ) and regarding a measure of anxiety ( mean distance to wall ) . Since we found that MYO16 is important for F - actin dynamics in cerebellar PCs and that synaptic organization in the cerebellum is altered in Myo16 − / − mice , we next monitored the motor learning ability of the knockout mice . In the accelerating rotarod test , both Myo16 − / − and wild - type control mice improved their performance over the ﬁrst ﬁve test days , without diﬀering signiﬁcantly between genotypes ( Figure 10B ) . Therefore , mice lacking myosin XVI perform similar to wild - type controls in this test for motor learning . Given the genetic association of MYO16 and ASD , we also examined Myo16 − / − mice for behaviors altered in mouse models of ASD . A marble burying test did not reveal diﬀerences in repetitive behavior of Myo16 − / − mice compared to littermate controls ( Figure 10C ) . Moreover , a social interaction test did not reveal deﬁcits of Myo16 − / − mice in their ability to discriminate between an empty chamber or a novel mouse , or between a familiar and a novel mouse ( Figure 10D ) . Therefore , at least this limited set Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 15 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 16 Roesler et al . Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines of behavioral assays did not reveal gross abnormalities in mouse behavior upon Myo16 knockout . DISCUSSION Here , we deﬁne myosin XVI as a novel component of the regulatory machinery of actin turnover in dendritic spines of cerebellar PCs , and we uncover that myosin XVI is important for normal presynaptic organization in the cerebellum . Our results shed light on the mechanisms that govern F - actin turnover in spines of PCs , a neuronal cell type implicated in motor learning , social behavior and ASD . We show that , similar to other neurons , the WRC - Arp2 / 3 pathway is crucial for the regulation of postsynaptic actin turnover in PCs . Interference with either WRC or Arp2 / 3 led to a reduced mobile pool and faster F - actin turnover in spines ( FRAP - and PC spine measurement - results are summarized in Table 1 ) . Notably , our observation that acute inhibition of Arp2 / 3 accelerates turnover rate in dendritic spines is consistent with the ﬁnding that CK - 666 increases retrograde actin ﬂow rates at the leading edge of neuronal growth cones ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) . In comparison , diverse outcomes for postsynaptic F - actin turnover upon interfering with Arp2 / 3 or WRC have been reported previously for other neurons . For example , sparse in vivo knockout of the Arp2 / 3 subunit ArpC3 in a subset of hippocampal neurons leads to a reduced mobile pool and slower recovery ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , WAVE1 knockdown was found to reduce the mobile pool of F - actin in cortical spines ( Njoo et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , heterozygous knockout of the WRC subunit Cyﬁp1 increases the mobile pool while leaving the recovery rate of spine F - actin unchanged ( Pathania et al . , 2014 ) . While Arp2 / 3 drives the formation of a non - uniformly oriented F - actin meshwork , formins promote the formation of linear actin ﬁlaments . We show that formins are also crucial for actin cytoskeleton dynamics in PC dendritic spines , as formin inhibition dramatically reduces the size of the mobile F - actin pool ( Table 1 ) . The eﬀect of SMIFH2 on mobile pool size being additive to CK - 666 supports the view that formins promote F - actin dynamics in a pathway parallel to Arp2 / 3 . Moreover , in contrast to Arp2 / 3 , inhibition of formins leaves F - actin turnover rate in PC spines unchanged but dampens spine size ﬂuctuations . Finally , PC spines become more elongated upon interfering with Arp2 / 3 or WRC ( Table 1 ) , consistent with formin - mediated polymerization of linear F - actin remaining . Along this line , depletion of MTSS1 , a positive regulator of Arp2 / 3 - mediated F - actin formation and negative regulator of formin DAAM1 , also leads to longer PC spines ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; Kawabata Galbraith et al . , 2018 ) . We measured an increased size of PC spines upon dominant - negative inhibition of WRC ( Figure 6E ) and upon acute inhibition of Arp2 / 3 or formins ( Figures 7H , L ) . This is surprising , given that in hippocampal neurons Arp2 / 3 is essential for the development of bigger , mature spines ( Spence et al . , 2016 ) . In part , the distinct outcome may be due to diﬀerent approaches taken ( e . g . , acute inhibition vs . genetic depletion ) . However , we propose that diﬀerences in the inherent properties of PC spines compared to hippocampal spines are also a major factor . For example , PC spines form independently of presynaptic input following an intrinsic program ( Sotelo , 1978 ) . Moreover , unlike hippocampal spines , PC spines do not undergo drastic morphological changes during plasticity ( Sdrulla and Linden , 2007 ) . Finally , in addition to WRC and Arp2 / 3 , also speciﬁc F - actin regulators exist in PCs that are not found in other neurons ( Miyagi et al . , 2002 ; Sekerkova et al . , 2003 ) . Increased PC spine size might aﬀect second messenger signaling within these microcompartements , leading to alteration in synaptic plasticity at PF - PC synapses . Our data suggest a model where myosin XVI activates the WRC - Arp2 / 3 pathway in PC spines in order to aﬀect F - actin turnover ( Figure 9E ) . First , Myo16 depletion via knockout or PC - speciﬁc knockdown phenocopies interference with the WRC - Arp2 / 3 pathway in terms of accelerated F - actin turnover rate in PC spines ( Table 1 ) . Second , there was no additive eﬀect of Myo16 knockout on F - actin turnover upon CK - 666 treatment ( Figures 7E , F ) , indicating that the myosin acts through Arp2 / 3 . Third , the model is also supported by the known physical interaction of myosin XVI with the WRC ( Yokoyama et al . , 2011 ) and by the localization of both GFP - MYO16 and the WRC component WAVE1 to PC spines ( Figures 2 , 5 ) . In contrast to interference with WRC and Arp2 / 3 , however , depletion of myosin XVI did not alter the relative size of the mobile F - actin pool and spine circularity ( Table 1 ) . This is consistent with the existence of alternative , myosin XVI - independent ways of TABLE 1 | Summary of GFP - actin FRAP and morphology / dynamics of Purkinje cell dendritic spines .

Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines activating WRC - Arp2 / 3 . Similar to certain synaptic scaﬀolding proteins ( e . g . , IRSp53 , nArgBP2 ; Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Lee et al . , 2016 ) and transmembrane proteins ( e . g . , neuroligins , protocadherins ; Chen et al . , 2014 ) , myosin XVI might recruit the WRC at speciﬁc sites and facilitate its local activation . Nevertheless , our data argue against a general requirement of the myosin for localizing the WRC to spines , as WAVE1 is still present in spines of Myo16 knockout cerebellum in situ . Myosin XVI might also function by bringing PP1c and / or PI3K in close proximity to the WRC in PC spines , thereby helping to regulate the local phosphorylation status – and thus activity – of the WRC . Genetic ablation of Arp2 / 3 and WRC components leads to deﬁcits in hippocampal synaptic transmission and to behavior deﬁcits ( Soderling et al . , 2003 , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ; Spence et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , also disrupted postsynaptic F - actin turnover caused by Myo16 knockout may result in altered synaptic targeting of neurotransmitter receptors or altered spine morphology . However , our analyses did not reveal changes in PC spine density or spine morphology upon Myo16 knockout . Moreover , subcellular fractionation and measurement of mEPSC amplitudes under basal activity indicate that synaptic AMPA receptor numbers are normal in the absence of myosin XVI . Notably , it has been suggested that the late phase of long - term depression in PCs requires actin polymerization ( Smith - Hicks et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , while we did not detect alterations in postsynaptic morphology or function in Myo16 − / − cerebellum , it is possible that myosin XVI - dependent actin turnover in PC spines speciﬁcally aﬀects synaptic plasticity at PF - PC synapses . Importantly , the absence of a deﬁcit in the rotarod test does not rule out that PC - dependent motor learning impairment is present in Myo16 knockout mice and may be detected using other tests ( compare e . g . , with Ha et al . , 2016 ) . Both ultrastructural analysis of the cerebellar molecular layer and mEPSC measurements pointed toward a striking presynaptic deﬁcit at Myo16 − / − PF - PC synapses . While synapse density was unchanged , a longer mEPSCs inter - event interval was observed , consistent with less spontaneous fusion events of synaptic vesicles in the absence of myosin XVI . This corroborates the reduction in presynaptic vesicle numbers visualized via electron microscopy . Notably , F - actin is also enriched at presynaptic sites , and presynaptic actin dynamics are thought to play a role for synaptic vesicle fusion ( Rust and Maritzen , 2015 ) . Moreover , Wave1 knockout leads to altered morphology of axon terminals ( Hazai et al . , 2013 ) , and we observed that WAVE1 localizes presynaptically at molecular layer synapses ( Figure 5C ) . This raises the possibility that myosin XVI regulates actin dynamics at the presynaptic side to promote normal terminal size and synaptic vesicle numbers ( Figure 9E ) . Future experiments will need to test this possibility . Interference with the regulation of F - actin dynamics may lead to behavioral alterations . For example , Wave1 knockout mice display motor coordination problems ( Soderling et al . , 2003 ) . Moreover , an acute requirement of Arp2 / 3 activity for fear memory formation was demonstrated by microinjecting CK - 666 into the lateral amygdala of live rats during fear conditioning ( Basu et al . , 2016 ) . Since we observed altered F - actin turnover in PC spines and altered synaptic transmission onto PCs upon Myo16 knockout , we carried out an initial behavioral characterization of Myo16 − / − mice . Notably , while common variations at the MYO16 locus are associated with ASD ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) , it is not known if Myo16 kockout mimics the eﬀect of these alleles . Nevertheless , we included tests for ASD - like behavior . We did not detect phenotypes of Myo16 − / − mice regarding locomotion activity , cerebellum - dependent motor learning , repetitive behavior and social interaction . This suggests that more elaborate future experiments will be needed to determine whether myosin XIV and / or actin turnover play a role for cerebellum - dependent functions such as motor learning or social behavior . Importantly , genetic evidence also indicates links of MYO16 to schizophrenia ( Rodriguez - Murillo et al . , 2014 ) and to bipolar disorder ( Kao et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , epigenetic changes at the MYO16 locus have been detected in depressed patients ( Gross et al . , 2017 ) and following learning tasks in mice ( Koberstein et al . , 2018 ) . Together , this underscores the signiﬁcance of determining in the future whether myosin XVI is crucial for the function of neuronal circuitry in vivo , and whether this involves regulation of F - actin dynamics . MATERIALS AND METHODS Plasmids Preﬁx “pL7” denotes plasmids carrying the PC - speciﬁc L7 ( Pcp - 2 ) promoter ( Oberdick et al . , 1990 ) . Plasmids pL7 - mGFP , pL7 - mCherry and pL7 - mGFP - F - tractin ( i . e . , pL7 - ITPKA - 9 - 52 - mGFP ) were described previously ( Wagner et al . , 2011a , b ) . pL7 - ITPKA - 9 - 52 - mCherry is identical to pL7 - ITPKA - 9 - 52 - mGFP except mGFP being replaced by mCherry . To generate pL7 - FusionRed for expressing a red ﬂuorescent volume marker in PCs , the FusionRed ORF ( Shemiakina et al . , 2012 ) was released from pFusionRed - C vector ( # FP411 , Evrogen , RU ) using NheI , BglII restriction enzymes and ligated with vector backbone obtained by NheI , BglII digest of pL7 - mGFP . Plasmid pL7 - mGFP - actin was created by inserting a BglII , BamHI fragment encoding human β - actin from pPA - TagRFP - actin ( # FP813 , Evrogen , RU ) in proper orientation into the BglII - site of pL7 - mGFP . To generate plasmid pL7 - FRED - WAVE1 (cid:49) VCA encoding WAVE1 lacking the VCA domain and fused at its N - terminus to FusionRed , a 1503 bp DNA fragment containing mouse Wasf1 sequence ( XM _ 006512932 . 2 , nucleotides 468 to 1955 ) ﬂanked by a BglII site at the 5 (cid:48) - end and a stop codon and SalI site at the 3 (cid:48) - end ( i . e . , 5 (cid:48) - agatct - CCGTTGGTG . . . AGTGACGCA - tgagtcgac , Wasf1 sequence in upper case letters ) was synthesized ( Euroﬁns Genomics GmbH ) , digested with BglII and SalI , and ligated with vector backbone obtained by BglII , SalI digest of pL7 - FusionRed . Plasmid pL7 - mGFP - Myo16 encodes myosin XVI full length heavy chain ( XP _ 006508842 . 1 ) fused at its N - terminus to GFP and corresponds to Mus musculus Myo16 transcript variant X2 ( XM _ 006508779 . 3 ) nucleotides 658 - 6417 cDNA inserted at the BglII , SalI sites of pL7 - mGFP . Plasmid pCMV - mGFP - Myo16 was constructed by releasing a 6520 bp fragment comprising the mGFP - Myo16 sequence via NheI , BamHI digest from pL7 - mGFP - Myo16 .

Based on a previously described approach ( Alexander and Hammer , 2016 ) , we created plasmids expressing miRNA knockdown constructs under L7 promoter control . Toward that end , DNA fragments containing the KD / scrambled sequence embedded in the miRNA backbone were PCR ampliﬁed from the respective pcDNA TM 6 . 2 - GW / EmGFP - miR - Myo16 - KD / scrambled plasmids using oligonucleotides L7sc _ F and L7sc _ R ( Table 2 ) .

Mice , Genotyping Wild type ( WT ) mice were C57BL / 6J ( B6 ) . Two novel mouse lines carrying distinct Myo16 knockout alleles and termed B6 - Myo16 em 2 Hhtg / J ( “S line” ; 210 bp deletion ) and B6 - Myo16 em 3 Hhtg / J ( “L line” ; 269 bp deletion ) were generated using CRISPR / Cas9 .

Moreover , brain size of homozygous Myo16 knockout mice was indistinguishable from WT littermates ( distance Bregma to Lambda , Myo16 + / + : 6 . 4 ± 0 . 7 mm , Myo16 − / − : 7 . 8 ± 1 . 3 mm ; brain area , Myo16 + / + : 88 . 5 ± 14 . 6 mm 2 , Myo16 − / − : 114 . 1 ± 34 . 6 mm 2 ; cerebellar area : Myo16 + / + : 23 . 3 ± 3 . 3 mm 2 , Myo16 − / − : 26 . 7 ± 7 . 3 mm 2 ; mean ± SD , n = 3 ; p = n . s . , Student’s t - test ) . PCR genotyping was performed to distinguish among absence , heterozygous presence or homozygous presence of the Myo16 knockout alleles . Genomic DNA was obtained by digesting tail biopsies or , for neuronal cultures , embryo tissue with QuickExtract TM DNA Extraction Solution ( Epicentre ) for 30 min at 65 ◦ C , followed by incubation for 10 min at 97 ◦ C . PCR was performed using primers FW2 and RV2 ( see Table 2 ) , Taq DNA Polymerase ( Roche # 04728874001 ) , and reaction conditions of 94 ◦ C for 2 min ; 35 times repeat of ( 94 ◦ C for 10 s , 67 ◦ C for 20 s , 72 ◦ C for 10 s ) ; followed by 72 ◦ C for 3 min . DNA fragments were separated on 1 . 2 – 2 . 0 % agarose gels and imaged using a UV transillumination / digital camera system ( INTAS Science Imaging Instruments ) . Myo16 knockout alleles yield a 191 bp ( S line ) or 132 bp ( L line ) fragment , the WT allele yields a 401 bp fragment ( Figure 1B ) . Alternatively , PCR was performed as above , but using primers FW1 and RV1 ( see Table 2 ) , and reaction conditions of 94 ◦ C for 2 min ; 35 times repeat of ( 94 ◦ C for 10 s , 68 ◦ C for 20 s , 72 ◦ C for 25 s ) ; followed by 72 ◦ C for 5 min . Here , Myo16 knockout alleles yield a 519 bp ( S line ) or 460 bp ( L line ) fragment , the WT allele yields a 729 bp fragment . Homozygous Myo16 knockout mice ( Myo16 − / − mice ) were obtained by mating heterozygous mice . Absence of MYO16 protein in Myo16 − / − mice was conﬁrmed by Western blot using pre - adsorbed anti - MYO16 antibody and extracts of cerebellum ( Figure 1C ) and hippocampus of young and adult mice . Protein Extracts , Fractionation , and Western Blot Analyses For detection of MYO16 and WAVE1 in cerebellar crude extracts ( Figures 1C , 5A ) , single cerebella were lysed in ice cold lysis buﬀer ( 150 mM NaCl , 1 % IGEPAL R (cid:13) CA - 630 [ I8896 , Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 19 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 20 Roesler et al . Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines Sigma - Aldrich ] , 50 mM Tris – Cl pH8 . 0 , protease inhibitors [ cOmplete TM Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ; # 04693116001 , Roche ] ) using 12 strokes with Potter S Homogenizer ( Sartorius AG ) . The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min , 4 ◦ C and the supernatant was mixed with 20 % ( v / v ) loading dye ( 5 % β - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 02 % bromophenol blue , 30 % glycerol , 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate [ SDS ] , 250 mM Tris – Cl pH 6 . 8 ) and denatured ( 10 min , 97 ◦ C ) . Subcellular fractionation of cerebellar extracts ( Figures 1H , I ) to yield a crude extract ( S1 ) , a membrane - enriched fraction ( P2 ) , a cytosolic fraction ( S2 ) , and a synaptosomal fraction ( SYP ) was carried out by lysing a complete cerebellum in Sucrose 1 buﬀer ( 320 mM sucrose , 1 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 500 µ M CaCl 2 , 1 µ M PMSF ) in the presence of EDTA - free protease inhibitors ( cOmplete Tablets , EASYpack , 04693132001 , Roche ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( PhosSTOP , EASYpack , 04906837001 , Roche ) , by potterization in 2 ml teﬂon tubes at 800 rpm and 12 strokes . S1 post - nuclear fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the total lysate at 1 , 400 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C . A fraction of S1 was conserved for further analysis and the rest was centrifugated at 13 , 800 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C to obtain S2 soluble and P2 membranous fractions . S2 fraction was conserved and P2 was resuspended in Sucrose 2 buﬀer ( 320 mM sucrose , 1 mM NaHCO 3 ) . P2 was shaken for 20 - 30 min at 4 ◦ C . Sucrose gradient for synaptosomal puriﬁcation was achieved by sequentially adding three distinct layers of 1 . 2 M , 1 M , and 0 . 8 M sucrose in the presence of NaHCO 3 . A part of the P2 fraction was conserved for analysis and 400 µ l were placed on top of the gradient and centrifugated at 22 , 000 rpm using SW40 Ti rotor for 2 h at 4 ◦ C . Synaptosomes were isolated from the interface between 1 . 2 and 1 M fractions of the gradient using a 1 ml syringe . In order to assess myosin XVI localization in synaptosomes ( Figure 2A ) , an identical protocol was used , however , omitting phosphatase inhibitors and PMSF from sucrose buﬀer 1 and , occasionally , NaHCO 3 from sucrose gradient . Protein concentration was quantiﬁed with Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay kit ( # 23227 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , and identical amounts of proteins were mixed with loading dye and denatured as above . Cerebellar crude extracts and fractions were separated via standard SDS - PAGE using 6 – 15 % gels . Spectra TM Multicolor High Range Protein Ladder ( 26625 , Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc ) and BlueStar Plus prestained protein markers ( MWP04 and MWP03 , Nippon Genetics ) were used as size standards . Proteins were transferred onto methanol - activated polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes ( PVDF ; Immobilon - P , # IPVH00010 , Merck Millipore ) using transfer buﬀer 1 ( 39 mM glycine , 48 mM Tris – Cl pH 8 . 3 , 0 . 037 % SDS , 20 % [ v / v ] methanol ) and semi - dry blotter V20 - SDB ( SCIE - PLAS , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) for 2 h or transfer buﬀer 2 ( 25 mM Tris – Cl pH 8 . 3 , 192 mM glycine and 20 % [ v / v ] methanol ) and wet blotting via Mini - Protean Tetra Cell system ( Biorad ) . Subsequently , the membrane was blocked with TBST ( 20 mM Tris – Cl pH 7 . 6 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween20 ) containing 5 % ( w / v ) non - fat dry milk or 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for 1 h at room temperature ( RT ) . Incubations with primary and horse - radish peroxidase - coupled secondary antibodies were also carried out in blocking solution . For Myo16 knockdown in HEK cells , HEK293 cells ( CRL - 1573 , ATCC ) grown in DMEM , high glucose , GlutaMAX TM Supplement ( 61965026 , ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) containing 20 % serum to a density of ∼ 75 % were co - transfected using the calcium phosphate method ( Gromova et al . , 2018 ) with plasmid pCMV - mGFP - Myo16 and a knockdown plasmid ( pcDNA TM 6 . 2 - GW / EmGFP - miR - Myo16 - KD1 , - KD2 , - KD3 , - KD4 , - KD5 , or - scrambled ) , as indicated . Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed on ice by pipetting up and down in PBS ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 4 ) containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , protease inhibitors ( cOmplete TM , EDTA - free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ; # 04693132001 , Roche ) and phosphatase inhibitors ( PhosSTOP TM ; # 04906845001 , Roche ) . After centrifugation at 1 , 000 × g for 5 min at 4 ◦ C , the supernatant was removed and protein concentration was quantiﬁed with Pierce TM BCA Protein Assay kit ( # 23227 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Identical amounts of protein were separated via SDS - PAGE using 8 – 15 % gels . Western blots were performed as above except that loading dye contained 10 % β - mercaptoethanol , size standard was Precision Plus Protein TM Dual Color Standard ( 1610374 , Biorad ) , and wet blotting was used with transfer buﬀer 2 . Chemiluminiscence detection was performed using Immobilon Western HRP Substrate ( # WBKLS0500 , Merck Millipore ) and CCD camera - based ChemoStar ECL detection system ( ChemoCam Imager ECL Typ HR 16 - 3200 , INTAS Science Imaging Instruments , Göttingen , GER ) . Signals were quantiﬁed using Fiji image processing software ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Dissociated Cerebellar Cultures Containing Purkinje Cells Preparation and transfection of cerebellar cultures containing PCs was done as described ( Wagner et al . , 2011b ) , with minor modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , C57BL / 6J X C57BL / 6J or Myo16 ± X Myo16 ± matings were used to obtain E17 - 18 mouse embryos from females after euthanization with CO 2 and cervical dislocation . Embryonic brains were isolated in ice - cold modiﬁed Hank’s balanced salt solution ( MHS ; HBSS without calcium and magnesium , Gibco TM 14170088 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) and treated individually during the whole procedure . In case of Myo16 knockout cultures , Myo16 − / − , Myo16 ± and Myo16 + / + brains were distinguished using PCR genotyping using embryo head tissue while the isolated brains were stored in Hibernate TM - E medium ( Gibco TM A1247601 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) up to 6 h . The cerebellar primordium was minced and digested for 20 min at 30 ◦ C using 7 U papain ( P3125 , Sigma - Aldrich ) . After addition of heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco TM 10082139 , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , cells were triturated in MHS containing 12 mM MgSO 4 ( M2643 , Sigma - Aldrich ) and 5 U / ml DNAse I ( Roche 04716728001 , Sigma - Aldrich ) and ﬁltered through a nylon mesh ( 180 µ m pore size , # NY8H04700 , Millipore ) . After a wash in MHS , all cells from one cerebellum were nucleofected in a single reaction using Mouse Neuron Nucleofector R (cid:13) Kit ( VPG - 1001 ; Lonza ; nucleofection program O - 003 ) according to manufacturer’s Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 20 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 21 Roesler et al . Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines instructions . The transfected cells were then mixed with untransfected cells from one WT cerebellum resuspended in 300 µ l DFM ( see below ) supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS . DFM consisted of Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium / Nutrient Mixture F - 12 Ham ( D6434 , Sigma - Aldrich ) supplemented with 1x GlutaMAX ( Gibco TM 35050 - 038 ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , 100 µ M putrescine dihydrochloride ( P5780 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 30 nM Na 2 SeO 3 ( S5261 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 40 nM progesterone ( P7556 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 0 . 77 nM L - 3 , 3 (cid:48) , 5 - tri - iodothyronine ( T2877 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 2 µ M cytosine β - D - arabinofuranoside ( C6645 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 200 µ g / ml apo - transferrin ( T1147 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 100 µ g / ml BSA ( A3156 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , and 20 µ g / ml insulin ( I0516 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . The whole cell mixture was plated onto the glass surface ( 14 mm diameter ) of a single glass bottom dish ( D35 - 14 - 1 . 5 - N , Invitro Scientiﬁc ) coated with poly - L - ornithine hydrobromide ( P4638 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , thus resulting in a single culture of transfected cells per cerebellum . Cultures were kept in an incubator ( 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 , saturated humidity ) . At 1 . 5 h after plating , 1 . 8 ml DFM containing 5 µ g / ml gentamicin ( Gibco TM 15710049 ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) were added per dish , and 4 – 36 h after plating 1 . 5 ml of culture medium were replaced with fresh DFM / gentamicin . Subsequently 1 ml of medium was replaced by fresh DFM / gentamicin once per week . Live Cell Microscopy Cultured PCs were observed using a spinning disk confocal microscope ( Visitron Systems GmbH ) consisting of an inverted microscope ( Nikon Ti - E ) equipped with a spinning disk ( Yokogawa ) , solid state lasers ( 405 , 488 , 561 , and 647 nm ) , a 100 × objective , EM - CCD cameras ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) , autofocus system ( Nikon TI - ND6 - PFS ) , a multi - point FRAP / photo - activation module ( VisiFRAP , Visitron Systems GmbH ) , and an incubation chamber for controlled environmental conditions ( 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 ) . During imaging , cultures were kept in their conditioned growth medium . Images shown in Figures 2B , D were obtained by recording Z - stacks ( 0 . 3 µ m Z - plane distance ) and subjecting them to noise removal ( de - noise , low pass ﬁlter ; VisiView R (cid:13) software , Visitron Systems GmbH ) . Maximum projections were generated and stitched using Fiji / MosaicJ ( Thevenaz and Unser , 2007 ; Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Images shown in Figures 2C , E , F , as well as Supplementary Movies S1 – S3 were obtained recording at a frame rate of 0 . 5 / s , followed by noise removal ( de - noise , low pass ﬁlter ; VisiView R (cid:13) software , Visitron Systems GmbH ) . Subsequently images were processed in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) using bleach correction ( histogram matching ) and generation of a three frame rolling average image . Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching To measure F - actin turnover in PC spines , FRAP experiments were performed with cultured PCs expressing GFP - actin at 14 – 15 DIV using the spinning disk microscope with a 100 × objective . Images were obtained using 488 nm excitation and an exposure time of 500 ms . In each trial , following ﬁve frames of starting point recording ( frame rate of 1 / s ) , the GFP - actin ﬂuorescence signal of six single spines on a PC was bleached by directing 405 nm laser light to a circular region ( 12 pixel diameter ) placed on the spine ( ∼ 2 s total bleach time for six spines ) . Imaging was resumed immediately after and continued for 145 s at a frame rate of 1 / s . If indicated , the following compounds were added to the culture medium prior to carrying out FRAP recordings : jasplakinolide ( # 420127 - 50UG , Merck ; added to ﬁnal concentration of 1 µ M ; FRAP performed 10 – 60 min after addition ) , CK - 666 ( # 3950 , Tocris Bioscience ; added to ﬁnal concentration of 200 µ M ; FRAP performed within 90 min after addition ) , SMIFH2 ( S4826 , Sigma - Aldrich ; added to ﬁnal concentration of 40 µ M ; FRAP performed 5 – 50 min after addition , as with combination of SMIFH2 and CK - 666 ) . GFP - actin ﬂuorescence intensity signal in bleached spines was quantiﬁed using Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ; Schneider et al . , 2012 ) . Intensity was measured from a region of constant size encompassing the spine throughout the duration of the experiment . To determine recovery of the bleached ﬂuorescence signal , the intensity measured in each frame was reduced by the intensity remaining in the ﬁrst frame after bleaching , yielding baseline - corrected intensity values F b . To correct for overall bleaching during the experiment , F b was multiplied with a bleach factor ( y ) calculated for each trial and time point , yielding bleach - corrected intensity values ( F bc ) . To obtain y , ﬂuorescence intensity in each frame was measured from part of the cell that included only spines not targeted by FRAP bleaching . After background correction of the measured intensities , bleach factor y was determined for each time point using Excel ( Microsoft ) by ﬁtting a curve described by the exponential equation y = at b ( a and b , ﬁtted variables ; t , time ) to the values obtained by dividing the initial , background - corrected intensity by the background - corrected intensity at each time point . The mean of F bc ( the bleach - corrected intensity values ) before FRAP bleaching was normalized to 100 % ( F 0 ) , and F bc values at each time point after bleaching were expressed relative to F 0 ( GFP - actin ﬂuorescence , % of initial ) , yielding the ﬂuorescence recovery curve . For each independent experiment ( i . e . , for each culture of transfected PCs derived from an individual embryo ) , a mean recovery curve was calculated from the recovery curves of roughly 50 spines on average , with up to six curves originating from a single FRAP trial . To calculate plateau and time constant τ of GFP - actin ﬂuorescence intensity recovery in spines , the mean recovery curves from each experiment were ﬁtted to the equation y = P ( 1 − exp ( − kx ) ) y , GFP - actin ﬂuorescence intensity ; x , time ; P , plateau ; k , inverse of τ . In case a mean recovery curve showed an intensity decrease of more than ﬁve percentage points at any time during the recovery phase , the values following the pre - decrease maximum value were ignored when ﬁtting the equation . If this led to less than 70 s of recovery time that could be ﬁtted , the data were excluded entirely from analysis . Cells that were immotile and stiﬀ ( i . e . , apparently dead ) during FRAP recording were also excluded from analyses . Spines were excluded if the ﬂuorescence signal was oversaturated , if the spine overlapped with another spine Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 21 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 22 Roesler et al . Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines during the 150 s of recording , or if the ﬂuorescence signal was not bleached close to background level . Spine Morphology and Dynamics of Live PCs The following parameters were determined using Fiji and the time - lapse movies of GFP - actin recorded during the FRAP experiments . 50 spines ( ﬁve spines from ten PCs ) that were not FRAP - bleached were analyzed for each condition . The area covered by randomly selected , individual spines was determined in each frame by selecting a threshold at the level of dendritic shaft GFP - actin signal intensity , followed by an automatic creation of a smoothened region of interest ( ROI ) around the above - threshold spine GFP - actin signal in each frame . The “spine area” was determined by averaging the ROI area of the ﬁrst three frames ( 1 s recording interval ) for each spine . The variation of the spine area during 2 . 5 min ( 150 frames of recording ) , denoted as “SD ( area over time ) , ” is the standard deviation of the relative area ( % of initial ) over 150 frames , with the average area of the ﬁrst three frames representing 100 % . A circularity index ( CI ) was calculated from the ROI using the formula CI = 4 π a p 2 ( a , area ; p , perimeter ) ( Rubio et al . , 2011 ) and is given as the average value of the ﬁrst three frames ( 1 s recording interval ) for each spine . The variation of the GFP - actin signal intensity in spines during 2 . 5 min ( 150 frames of recording ) , denoted as “SD ( intensity over time ) , ” is the standard deviation of the relative ﬂuorescence intensity ( % of initial ) over 150 frames , with the average intensity of the ﬁrst 20 frames representing 100 % . Spine GFP - actin signal intensity was determined for each frame by measuring the integrated intensity within the above determined ROI , followed by background subtraction , bleaching correction and calculation of a 20 frame rolling average intensity value . Immuno - Histochemistry and Immuno - Electron Microscopy For WAVE1 immuno - histochemistry ( Figure 5B ) , ∼ 6 month old adult mice were anesthetized by a mixture of ketanest and rompun and transcardially perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate - buﬀer ( PB ) . Brains were post - ﬁxed in PFA / PB ( overnight , 4 ◦ C ) before 50 µ m vibratome sections were cut . Brain sections were washed in PBS , incubated for 10 min in 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) NaBH 4 in PBS , washed again in PBS , and blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 10 % ( v / v ) horse serum ( HS ) , 0 . 3 % ( w / v ) BSA and 0 . 3 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 . Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in carrier ( PBS containing 1 % HS , 0 . 2 % BSA and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 ) for 24 h at 4 ◦ C with gentle agitation , washed in PBS , and incubated for 2 h with secondary antibodies diluted in carrier . After wash in PBS , sections were mounted on glass slides using ProLong TM Gold Antifade Mountant ( P36930 ; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , imaged on an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope ( 60 × objective ; 0 . 8 µ m Z - plane thickness ) . Similarily , for immuno - histochemistry shown in Figures 1D – G , 19 – 26 week old mice were perfused as above . Postﬁxation was carried out for 48 h , followed by cryoprotection of the brains in 30 % Sucrose / PBS . Brains were frozen in TissueTek at - 80 ◦ C and 40 mm thick sagittal sections were obtained with a cryostat ( Cryostar NX70 , Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . For staining , sections were washed in PBS and permeabilized 20 min in presence of PBS / 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 at RT . Subsequently , sections were washed three times in PBS and blocked with blocking buﬀer ( PBS / 10 % goat serum / 1 % BSA ) for 1 – 2 h at RT . Primary antibodies were diluted in Ab incubation buﬀer ( PBS / 3 % goat serum , 1 % BSA / 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 ) and incubated over night in a wet chamber at 4 ◦ C before washing the sections three times in PBS , followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies in Ab incubation buﬀer ( 1 – 2 h at RT ) . After three washes , sections were mounted using Aqua Poly / Mount ( 18606 - 20 , Polysciences , Inc . ) and observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy as above . Images were processed and analyzed using Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Shank2 clusters were manually counted in a ∼ 432 um 2 square area within three sections of the cerebellar molecular layer ( identiﬁed via calbindin staining ) for each animal . NLGN2 clusters were counted in a ∼ 6000 um 2 square area spanning the whole molecular layer in ﬁve sections per animal using the “Analyze Particles” function . For Nissl staining , sections were delipidized in ethanol with increasing concentration ( 70 , 95 , and 100 % ) followed by submersion in xylen ( 30 s per step ) . Rehydration was performed following the opposite order ending in H 2 O for 4 min . After 3 – 4 min incubation in cresyl violet stain ( 0 . 1 % cresyl violet acetate , 2 . 5 % glacial acetic acid ) sections were rinsed with dH 2 O for 1 min and 6 – 7 times in 70 % ethanol . Subsequently , a diﬀerentiation step was carried out by alternating between 95 % ethanol and 95 % ethanol with 10 % acetic acid . Sections were then dehydrated with consecutive 30 s washes in 95 % ethanol , 100 % ethanol and xylen before covered with entellan . Images were taken with a stereomicroscope ( Stemi 2000C , Zeiss , GER ) . For ultrastructural electron microscopy ( Figure 8 ) , 40 week old anesthetized mice that previously underwent behavioral testing ( see below ) were transcardially perfused with 4 % PFA ( postﬁxed in a mixture of 4 % PFA and 1 % glutaraldehyde ) in 0 . 1 M PB at pH 7 . 4 . Similarly , for immuno - electron microscopy ( Figure 5C ) , 38 week old mice were transcardially perfused with a mixture of 4 % PFA and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M PB at pH 7 . 4 . Brains were removed and 100 µ m thick sagittal sections were cut with a Vibratom ( Leica VT 1000S ) . Thereafter , pre - embedding immuno - electron microscopy was performed as follows : Sections were cryoprotected in 2 . 3M sucrose and subjected to two cycles of freeze - thaw in liquid nitrogen to aid penetration of immunoreagents into tissue . After rinsing in PBS , sections were incubated with PBS containing 10 % HS and 0 . 2 % BSA for 15 min , before being incubated with primary antibody in PBS containing 1 % HS and 0 . 2 % BSA overnight . Cells were washed with PBS , then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody in PBS containing 1 % HS and 0 . 2 % BSA for 90 min . After rinsing , they were incubated with ABC ( Vector Labs ) diluted 1 : 100 in PBS for 90 min . Sections were washed in PBS and reacted in diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) - H 2 O 2 solution Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 22 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 23 Roesler et al . Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines ( Sigma , St . Louis , United States ) for 10 min . Thereafter sections were rinsed three times in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buﬀer ( pH 7 . 2 – 7 . 4 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , Buchs , Switzerland ) and incubated with 1 % osmium tetroxide ( Science Services , Munich , Germany ) in cacodylate buﬀer for 20 min on ice . The osmication of sections was followed by dehydration through ascending ethyl alcohol concentration steps and rinsed twice in propylene oxide ( Sigma - Aldrich , Buchs , Switzerland ) . Inﬁltration of the embedding medium was performed by immersing the tissue ﬁrst in a mixture of 2 : 1 of propylene oxide and Epon ( Carl Roth , Karlsruhe , Germany ) , then in a 1 : 1 mixture , and ﬁnally in neat Epon and hardened at 60 ◦ C for 48 h . Ultrathin sections ( 60 nm ) were collected and analyzed with an EM902 transmission electron microscope ( Zeiss , Germany ) equipped with a CCD in lens 2K digital camera and running the ImageSP software ( Tröndle , Moorenweis , Germany ) . Quantiﬁcation of synaptic parameters from electron microscopy images was performed using Fiji . For counting molecular layer synapse numbers , 7 . 086 µ m × 7 . 086 µ m images were obtained with 12 , 000 × magniﬁcation . 25 consecutive images of the middle third area of the molecular layer were analyzed for each animal , with a total of three animals per genotype . Synapses were counted if they showed a uninterupted outline of the pre - and postsynaptic specialization , ER structure and PSD in spine head and an opposing presynaptic terminal with vesicles . For analyzing spine and presynaptic structural properties , images of the cerebellar molecular layer were taken using 20 , 000 × magniﬁcation . Synapses were identiﬁed using the same criteria as before . Cerebellar Slice Electrophysiology and Biocytin Staining of PCs Mice used for electrophysiological measurements were 3 – 4 weeks old . After decapitation of mice under isoﬂurane anesthesia , the brain was removed into ice - cold slicing medium containing ( in mM ) 240 sucrose , 2 . 5 Na 2 HPO 4 , 2 MgSO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 10 D - glucose , and 1 CaCl 2 which was carbonated continuously ( 95 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 ) . 200 µ m thick sagittal slices of the cerebellum were cut using a vibratome ( Leica CT1200S ) and left for incubation in artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid ( ACSF ) containing ( in mM ) 124 NaCl 2 , 5 KCl , 1 . 25 NaHPO 4 , 2 MgSO 4 , 26 NaHCO 3 , 20 D - glucose and 2 CaCl 2 for 1 h at 37 ◦ C and constant carbonation . mEPSCs were measured at 34 ◦ C and in the presence of 100 µ M picrotoxin ( P1675 , Sigma - Aldrich ) , 50 µ M ( 2R ) - amino - 5 - phosphonovalecric acid ( D - APV ; 79055 - 68 - 8 , Tocris ) and 1 µ M tetrodotoxin ( TTX ; 1078 , Tocris ) . Whole - cell patch clamp recordings were performed with an EPC10 ampliﬁer ( HEKA Electronics , Lamprecht , Germany ) . PCs were visualized using a research Zeiss Axioskop 2 FS plus microscope equipped with a 40x objective . Recording electrodes of 4 – 5 M (cid:127) , 1 . 5 mm outer diameter and 0 . 87 mm inner diameter ( 1810016 , Hilgenberg ) were ﬁlled with intracellular solution containing ( in mM ) 120 K - gluconate , 9 KCl , 10 KOH , 3 . 48 MgCl 2 , 4 NaCl , 10 HEPES , 4 Na 2 ATP , 0 . 4 Na 3 GTP , 17 . 5 sucrose and 1 mg / ml biocytin ( 3349 , Tocris ) ( pH 7 . 25 – 7 . 35 with an osmolality of 295 ± 5 ) . Recordings were excluded from analysis if the noise level exceeded 10 pA . Slices with successfully measured cells were ﬁxed after recording in Histoﬁx ( P087 . 6 , Roth ) , washed with PBS and permeabilized in PBS / 0 . 2 % Triton . 20 % [ w / v ] BSA was added for blocking . For staining , Alexa Fluor R (cid:13) 488 streptavidin conjugate ( S32354 , Invitrogen / Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) was diluted in PBS / 20 % BSA ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) . Slices were mounted in Aqua Poly / Mount ( 18606 - 20 , Polysciences , Inc . ) and imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus FV1000 ) equipped with a 60 × objective ( 488 nm laser line for excitation , 0 . 2 µ m Z - plane thickness ) . Deconvolution was performed using AutoQant ( 100 deconvolution cycles ; Media Cybernetics Inc . ) . To determine spine density , Imaris ﬁlament tracer and Imaris 8 . 4 . 1 spine module ( Imaris Bitplane ) were used . Mouse Behavior Analyses All behavior experiments were performed with a cohort of males of the B6 - Myo16 em 3 Hhtg / J line backcrossed to C57BL / 6J for at least ﬁve generations . Heterozygous mice were bred in house to obtain naïve , age - matched Myo16 + / + ( 11 individuals ) and Myo16 − / − ( 11 individuals ) mice for the experiments . Weight did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between groups . Animals were housed in groups of littermates ( 3 – 5 individuals per cage ) in an acclimatized animal vivarium ( 21 ± 1 ◦ C , relative humidity 55 ± 5 % ) under a 12 h : 12 h reversed light / dark cycle and were tested during dark hours . The mice had ad libitum access to food and water . At the beginning of the experiments , animals were between 9 and12 weeks old . All experiments were performed blind to genotype . Open Field The open ﬁeld apparatus consisted of four identical square ( 50 × 50 × 50 cm ) arenas made of white polyvinyl foam material . Four lamps were installed that provided even lightning ( 50 lux ) in each arena and a video camera that was mounted directly above the apparatus . The videos were transmitted to a computer running Ethovision tracking software ( Version XT8 . 5 , Noldus Technology , Netherlands ) . Up to 4 mice were tested at the same time , counterbalanced across genotypes but blind to the experimenter . The mice were introduced to one corner of the arena and were allowed to explore undisturbed for 30 min . Total distance moved , velocity and mean distance to the wall were analyzed in 5 min consecutive time bins . Rotarod The Ugo Basile Model 47600 ( Comerio , VA , Italy ) accelerating rotarod for mice was used . The testing area was illuminated diﬀusely with 30 lux white light . A digital camera was located close to the apparatus to capture videos . The test was performed in two steps . For habituation , up to ﬁve subjects were tested simultaneously and placed on the rotating drum at a baseline speed of four rounds per minute ( rpm ) for up to 180 s . Two trials were performed with an inter - trial interval of 50 – 60 min . On the same day , three trials were performed for each subject with the speed increasing linearly for 4 min from 4 to 40 rpm . Animals were allowed to stay on the rotating drum for up to 600 s with an inter trial interval of 50 – 60 min . On the next 5 days each subject was tested in three trials per day of accelerating speed as Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 23 August 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 330 fncel - 13 - 00330 August 10 , 2019 Time : 15 : 56 # 24 Roesler et al . Myo16 Regulates Actin in Spines described above , however , the inter - trial interval was shortened to 10 – 15 min . The latency to fall was measured . Two capture a second time window , the same animals performed the task again 5 weeks later for seven consecutive days . Marble Burying Test Two 26 × 42 cm cages , ﬁlled 6 cm high with ﬁne fresh bedding material were used . Cages were closed with a plastic plate leaving space for air circulation . On the bedding , 20 marbles were placed in a regular pattern , covering the whole area . The apparatus was illuminated by diﬀuse light of 30 lux . A digital camera was located close to the apparatus to capture videos . Each mouse was introduced into the cage and allowed to explore freely for 30 min . Between subjects , the bedding was stirred thoroughly , pressed down to have a plane surface and marbles were again placed on top . The marbles buried were counted manually in 5 min time bins . Social Interaction Test The social interaction test was performed in a white , compartmentalized box made out of polyvinyl foam material . The box had the dimensions of 61 × 37 cm and was divided twice , resulting in three linked compartments : left ( 22 × 37 cm ) , center ( 17 × 37 cm ) , and right ( 22 × 37 cm ) , with doors in between . In the outer compartments , a round chamber ( 12 cm diameter , 13 cm high ) with a heavy lid was placed . The apparatus was illuminated with 30 lux and a digital camera was mounted directly above the setup . Videos were transmitted to a computer running Ethovision tracking software ( Version XT8 . 5 , Noldus Technology , Netherlands ) equipped with three - point ( nose , body center , and tail ) detection settings . After 5 min of habituation in the center compartment , doors were opened and mice were allowed to move freely between all three compartments . Active exploration was scored when the nose of the test mouse was detected within a distance of 2 cm to the round chambers . A WT mouse unknown to the test mouse ( novel mouse ) was present in one chamber , whereas the second chamber was empty . After 10 min a second , unfamiliar WT mouse ( novel mouse ) was placed in the empty chamber and the test mouse was allowed to explore for another 10 min . In the ﬁrst part of the test , time spent with the novel mouse compared to the empty chamber was analyzed . In the second part , the time spent with unfamiliar mouse compared to familiar mouse was analyzed . Discrimination index was calculated as time spent with “novel mouse” divided by the time spent with “empty chamber” and “novel mouse” multiplied by 100 ( part 1 ) , or time spent with “novel mouse” divided by the time spent with “familiar mouse” and “novel mouse” ( part 2 ) multiplied by 100 . Statistics Analyses were performed using Prism 7 . 04 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . All data sets were subjected to Shapiro - Wilk normality test . When comparing two groups fulﬁlling the normality test , p values were obtained using Student’s t - test ( if variance in data sets was the same according to F test ) or using t - test with Welch’s correction ( if variance in data sets was diﬀerent according to F test ) . When comparing two groups not fulﬁlling the normality test , exact p values were obtained using Mann – Whitney test . For comparison of more than two groups that all fulﬁll the normality test , the presence of signiﬁcant diﬀerences was ﬁrst evaluated using ordinary one - way ANOVA , followed by Dunnett’s , Tukey’s or Sidak’s multiple comparisons test against the control values . For comparison of more than two groups that not all fulﬁll the normality test , the presence of signiﬁcant diﬀerences was ﬁrst evaluated using ordinary Kruskal - Wallis test , followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test against the control values . Signiﬁcance values are indicated in the ﬁgures as ∗ p < 0 . 05 ; ∗∗ p < 0 . 01 ; ∗∗∗ p < 0 . 001 ; ∗∗∗∗ p < 0 . 0001 ; n . s . , not signiﬁcant . For behavior analyses , data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics ( SPSS Inc . , Chicago , IL , United States , Version 22 ) . The statistical tests are indicated in the ﬁgure legends of each experiment . For statistical signiﬁcance a type I error rate of p = 0 . 05 was deﬁned , all tests were performed two tailed . For analyzing data measured in diﬀerent time bins , repeated measures ANOVA with genotype as between subject factor and time ( bins ) as within subject factor was carried out , followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test whenever appropriate .
