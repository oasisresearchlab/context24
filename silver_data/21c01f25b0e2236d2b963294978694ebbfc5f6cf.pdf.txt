How much are ﬂexibility and uncertainty worth in patent licensing ? Maria Isabella Leone 1 • Raffaele Oriani 1 • Toke Reichstein 2 Received : 3 November 2014 / Revised : 11 October 2015 / Accepted : 12 October 2015 / Published online : 22 October 2015 (cid:2) Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale 2015 Abstract As patent licensing has become the prime driver of technology trade , understanding the rationales behind a properly - deﬁned payment structure of the agreements is essential . Speciﬁcally , among the other remuneration components , upfront fees are critical in license negotiations since they imply a signiﬁcant initial investment by the licensee and represent a source of liquidity for the licensor . We investigate how contractual ﬂexibility , market uncertainty and technical uncertainty shape upfront fees from the licensee’s perspective . Upfront fees are shown to be positively associated with contractual ﬂexibility and market uncertainty , while technical uncertainty is positively associated with upfront fees only if the license warrants contractual ﬂexibility to the licensee . Licensees therefore do not neces - sarily see uncertainty as a negative attribute of a patent license , but rather as a potential value , above all if in presence of contractual ﬂexibility .

To the extent that patents have become the fulcrum of a massive trade , it is crucial to know how much they are worth within licensing contracts . Answers to these questions could help potential partners to agree a proper payment structure and hence to ﬁnalize a licensing agreement that will not be terminated before expiration ( Sakakibara 2010 ) . In line with this premise , annual surveys by the Licensing Executive Society ( US and Canada ) show that one of the most frequent reasons for failed licensing negotiations is inability of the licensing parties to agree mutually acceptable con - tractual terms ( Razgaitis 2003 , 2004 ) . The reason why the payment structure is a critical aspect of a patent license is because it deﬁnes the creation and distribution of the value between the licensor and the licensee ( Parr and Smith 2005 ; Baldi and Trigeorgis 2014 ) . Indeed , license agreements usually provide monetary compen - sation for the patent owner in terms of either ﬁxed or variable fees . An initial ﬁxed fee ( upfront ) usually remunerates the past R & D efforts of the patent owner ; variable fees have normally the form of royalties associated with the use of the licensed technology . The upfront fee paid by the licensee is a critical aspect of the payment structure as it represents a signiﬁcant irreversible investment for the licensee and an important and immediate cash inﬂow for the licensor ( Kulatilaka and Lin 2006 ) We put forward a series of hypotheses arguing that the upfront fee is the result of circumstances related to the contract , the underlying technology , and the licensee’s primary market . More precisely , we argue that contractual ﬂexibility implying the possibility to shelve the licensed technology without incurring further costs increases the value of the contract in the eyes of the licensee . Furthermore , we suggest that the degree of uncertainty associated with the licensed technology and licensee’s market tend to be positively related to the upfront fee . In addition , we argue the positive associations with technology and market uncertainty is strengthened when the ﬁrms have been granted some contractual ﬂexibility . Overall , these predictions are consistent with real options theory ( e . g . , Ziedonis 2007 ; Baldi and Trigeorgis 2014 ) and the shelving hypothesis ( e . g . , Garud and Nayyar 1994 ; Dechenaux et al . 2009 ) . We test our hypotheses empirically on a sample of 112 patent licenses referring to different technologies ( IPC codes ) and industries ( SIC codes ) . In our analysis , we focus only on ( pure ) license agreements , excluding collaboration or settlement agreements , cross - licensing , technology purchases and merger plans , which , even important and relevant , might be priced according to different criteria . The patent license agreements are drawn from the Financial Valuation Group database on intellectual property ( FVGIP ) and integrated through textual analysis of the licensing contracts on the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) website . In addition , our research design allows us to offer some control for the relative negotiation power between the two parties . This is based on Mundlak 372 Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 123 instrumentation and the argument that licensing agreements often are byproducts of external agents with extensive experience in contracting . The paper contributes to the recent economic and management literature on technology licensing in several ways . First , our analysis contributes to the discussion of patent license payment structures by revealing the role played by ﬂexibility and uncertainty in contract design . Second , it provides empirical evidence based on an original dataset suggesting that contractual speciﬁcations and market and technical uncertainty as well as the interaction among these , have an impact on the amount of the upfront fee in patent licensing . In particular , the results show that upfront fees increase with the degree of contractual ﬂexibility and that licensees will be willing to pay more to enter a licensing agreement in the presence of greater market and technical uncertainty . They also highlight that the effect of contractual ﬂexibility is ampliﬁed if the licensed patent is characterized by higher technical uncertainty , which is typical of early - stage technologies . Most of the existing empirical evidence is related to university patents ( Ziedonis 2007 ; Dechenaux et al . 2008 , 2011 ) , whereas the dataset in this paper utilize licenses for ﬁrm patents for which data are generally less available due to conﬁdentiality issues . Third , we focus on the licensee’s perspective , somewhat under - investigated in the licensing literature ( as also noted by Arora and Gambardella 2010 ; Ceccagnoli and Jiang 2013 ) , which mainly focuses on the patent - holder / licensor’s decision ( e . g . , Erutku and Richelle 2007 ; Fosfuri 2006 ; Kulatilaka and Lin 2006 ) . 2 Hypothesis development 2 . 1 Contractual ﬂexibility in licensing agreements Patent licenses are contracts in which a ﬁrm ( licensor ) typically transfer / share the rights to use and further develop a technology to / with another ﬁrm ( licensee ) in exchange for ﬁxed and / or variable payments . In this context , the licensee usually enjoys some degree of ﬂexibility , since he / she can have the possibility to shelve the underlying patent and await new information without incurring in additional costs ( unless differently speciﬁed in the contract ) . Shelving occurs when the licensee decides not to invest further in the development and commercialization of the licensed technology ( Thursby et al . 2005 ; Dechenaux et al . 2009 ) . This may happen because the technology has proven to be less valuable than expected or there is still a high degree of uncertainty about its technical or market potential . The licensee may decide to sign a licensing contract only ‘‘to preserve its option to enter the market [ even though it ] doesn’t really intend to do so’’ ( Razgaitis 2003 : 309 ) and ‘‘abandoning a license is a planned possible outcome right from the start’’ ( Razgaitis 2003 : 178 ) . Contractual ﬂexibility , therefore , consists of the possibility to delay commercialization of the licensed patent or abandon its exploitation without further costs . The alleged ﬂexibility of a patent license is well captured in the following extract from a materials contract between CNS Inc . and an individual licensor ( CNS 1995 ) : Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 373 123 ‘‘Licensee shall not be under any obligation to use , exploit , develop or market any license under this Agreement . Licensee shall be entitled to use its sole business judgment in deciding the manner and extent , if any , of any exploitation of any licenses granted hereunder and in deciding whether to use any other products , devices techniques or technology competing therewith in any ﬁeld of use’’ . That licensees , in some cases , choose not to exploit the licensed technologies is also evident from a patent license agreement found in the ﬁlings of Exactech Inc . ( 1996 ) , a drug , cosmetics and health care ﬁrm , which includes the following sentence : ‘‘ … to date , the Company has only utilized the University patents in connection with product research and development and accordingly , the Company has paid no royalties to the University’’ . Given that the decision to exploit a patent license requires substantial speciﬁc investment in production facilities and marketing ( Miller and Folta 2002 ) , potential shelving has several beneﬁts for the licensee . First , while preserving the option to commercialize the patent , the licensee may prevent commercialization by competitors ( Gilbert and Newbery 1982 ; Dechenaux et al . 2008 , 2009 ) . Second , shelving the technology gives the licensee the possibility to commercialize the patent only if its value is higher than the investment required , thereby avoiding potential losses in the case that the patent proves less valuable than expected ( Miller and Folta 2002 ) . Third , shelving provides the licensee with the opportunity to switch technologies in the future if the shelved technology is found to be appropriate for new products and processes ( Garud and Nayyar 1994 ) . For all these reasons , ﬂexible contracts may be highly valuable in the perspective of the licensee . However , not all the licensing contracts are characterized by the same degree of ﬂexibility . Contractual ﬂexibility depends on the inclusion of contractual clauses and requirements for ﬁxed payments during the licensing period ( Anand and Khanna 2000 ) . Minimum annual royalties are ﬁxed cash payments due on the anniversary of the license which must be paid even if the licensee decides to delay or abandon patent commercialization . The minimum royalty clause implies , therefore , a cost for not using the license . To cover these costs , the licensee is more inclined not to shelve the technology and generate revenues based on it . Hence , the presence of such a clause signiﬁcantly reduces the contractual ﬂexibility for the licensee ( Anand and Khanna 2000 ) . As a consequence , patent licenses that include minimum royalties and offer lower contractual ﬂexibility are , ceteris paribus , less valuable to the licensee , and the licensee will be willing to pay a lower premium ( i . e . , upfront fee ) . We can hypothesize that : Hypothesis 1 The upfront fee for a patent license increases with contractual ﬂexibility . 2 . 2 Uncertainty The outcome of a patent license agreement , similar to other contracts , is affected by some degree of uncertainty . However , the assets exchanged within a license contract 374 Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 123 entail more uncertain returns than other assets ( Scherer and Harhoff 2000 ; Lemley and Shapiro 2007 ; Gans et al . 2008 ) . This is due to the difﬁculty of predicting the technical performance of a new patented technology and its commercial success in the market ( Huchzermeier and Lock 2001 ) . As Lemley and Shapiro ( 2005 : 81 ) state : ‘‘ [ m ] any patent applications , and indeed patents themselves , are like lottery tickets . Inventors who are uncertain of the commercial signiﬁcance of their ideas seek to patent many of them anyway , knowing that most of the resulting patents will turn out to be worthless , but hoping that few will pay - off big time’’ . In the case of licensing agreements , however , the potential loss is limited ( the limit of potential losses is deﬁned by the agreed license costs ) ; while there is no upper bound to the potential gains ( Baldi and Trigeorgis 2014 ) . Therefore , the greater the uncertainty is , the higher the value of the contract for the licensee . In fact , in the perspective of the licensee , the licensed asset is characterized by a truncation at the lower quantiles and no upper truncations . There are two main sources of uncertainty affecting patent value : market and technical uncertainty . Market uncertainty is related to the variability of the expected level of demand ( Oriani and Sobrero 2008 ) and depends on exogenous factors , such as the evolution of customer preferences and demographic or institutional changes ( Huchzermeier and Lock 2001 ) . It affects the potential revenues from patent commercialization by the licensee . Variability in demand can make the effective revenues higher or lower than expected . Since , in the latter case , the potential loss for the licensee is limited , market uncertainty mainly affects the upside value of the patent license . The effect of market uncertainty on the value of a license ( and the upfront fee that the licensee is required to pay ) is therefore positive from the licensee’s perspective . Accordingly , we suggest : Hypothesis 2 The upfront fee for a patent license increases with the degree of market uncertainty . The second main source of uncertainty related to patent value is technical uncertainty , which is associated with the technical performance and feasibility of the patented technology ( A˚stebro and Dahlin 2005 ) and derives from the technical novelty of an innovation ( Ziedonis 2007 ) . However , technical novelty is also associated with greater technical opportunities and higher potential for technolog - ical advance ( A˚stebro and Dahlin 2005 ) . Technical uncertainty can raise the technical performance of the innovation above expectations , but it might also reduce it , making the new product or service more or less attractive to the potential customers . Again , technical uncertainty mostly affects the potential upside value of the patent license as , in the case of unfavourable evolution of the technical performance , the loss of the licensee will be limited to the agreed license costs . Therefore , in the presence of higher technical uncertainty , the licensee is willing to pay a higher premium ( i . e . , upfront fee ) to enter the licensing agreement . Accordingly , we hypothesize that : Hypothesis 3 The upfront fee for a patent license increases with the degree of technical uncertainty . Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 375 123 2 . 3 Flexibility and uncertainty In the context of patent licensing , we propose that the contractual ﬂexibility impacts the lower bound ( cost incurred in the transaction by the licensee ) of the performance distribution while the uncertainty has a greater impact on the upper bound of the potential gains . However , little work has so far paid attention to the interaction between contractual ﬂexibility and uncertainty . In a different context , Tsay ( 1999 ) analyses how suppliers and customers can use ﬂexibility in contracts to reduce the negative effects of market uncertainty ; he shows that there is a trade - off between ﬂexibility and unit price , with the customer willing to pay more per unit to obtain more ﬂexibility . Reimann and Schiltknecht ( 2009 ) show how the contractual ﬂexibility offered to clients , which is highly valued by them , can imply huge costs for manufacturers because it exposes them to high market uncertainty . In the broader ﬁeld of supply chain management , several studies show that market uncertainty ( e . g . Jordan and Graves 1995 ) and technical uncertainty ( e . g . Chambers et al . 2009 ) can increase the value of manufacturing ﬂexibility . These studies converge in suggesting that uncertainty and ﬂexibility have both a direct and an interaction effect on the value of an asset or a contract . Within the speciﬁc context of patent licenses , more ﬂexible contracts may signiﬁcantly reduce the potential negative impact of uncertainty for the licensee as the ﬁrm can discontinue the project at any given time without any further cost . In other words , if the licensing contract does not impose any ﬁxed payment after the upfront fee , market and technical uncertainty impact strictly the upside value , while no additional loss will be generated for the licensee in case of negative evolution of the market demand or the technical performance . Furthermore , ﬂexible contracts provide the licensee with the opportunity to delay speciﬁc investments without additional costs until the market or technical uncertainty associated with the patent have reached a lower level . Thus , we propose the following two hypotheses : Hypothesis 4a Contractual ﬂexibility and market uncertainty have a mutual reinforcing positive impact on the upfront fee for a patent license . Hypothesis 4b Contractual ﬂexibility and technological uncertainty have a mutual reinforcing positive impact on the upfront fee for a patent license . 3 Data and method 3 . 1 Data and sample The aim of the empirical analysis is to assess the effect of contractual ﬂexibility and uncertainty on the upfront fee that the licensee pays to sign a licensing contract . The research design requires the development of an extensive dataset providing information on the licenses , their contractual terms , the licensed patents , and the parties to the contracts . 376 Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 123 Our data source is the FVGIP database developed by the Financial Valuation Group ( FVG ) , a leading business valuation consulting and litigation service ﬁrm in North America ( http : / / www . fvgﬂ . com / , accessed January 2014 ) . This database was created to allow empirical research on various aspects of intellectual property transfer agreements including know - how , patents , copyright , and brands . FVG uses three main data collection criteria : ( 1 ) the license must involve explicit exchange of an IPR ; ( 2 ) the transaction has been closed ; ( 3 ) a payment structure was agreed by the parties , although for conﬁdentiality reasons monetary amounts were not nec - essarily available . The primary information attached to these transactions includes : date of event and data source ; licensor and licensee names ; their respective SIC and NAICS industry codes ; type of agreement ; brief summary of the transaction ; United States Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce ( USPTO ) identiﬁcation number for the patent ( s ) in - volved in the transaction ; and payment structure details were available . Full details relating to payments are not always disclosed ( or may be misreported ) in contracts , due to their strategic and competition relevance ( Kamiyama et al . 2006 ; Cockburn 2007 ) . To minimize bias arising from this feature , we drew on other sources of information to augment the FVGIP data . We proceeded as follows . First , from the FVGIP database we retained only those transactions referred to as patent license agreements . Second , we retrieved the original license agreements or excerpts contained in other company ﬁlings ( e . g . S1 , 8K , 10K ) , 1 from the SEC database , and extracted exact information on licensed patents . Of the 600 licenses in the FVGIP database , in only 101 cases was all the information available . To ﬁll in the gaps , we searched the patents in the USPTO dataset on the basis of the information in the text of the license agreement ( application number or title of the licensed patent ) . In some cases we were able to identify patents by searching the name of assignee in the year of the license , and the keywords provided in the brief description of the licensed technology in the FVGIP dataset . The result was 301 patent license agreements for which the information required was available . After ﬁltering to retain only ( pure ) license agreements ( excluding collaboration or settlement agreements , cross - licensing , technology purchases and merger plans erroneously included under the heading of technology and patent license agreements ) , our sample included 227 licenses involving 884 USPTO patents . We next extracted information on the contractual and payment structures of the transactions . For each of the 227 license agreements , we recorded a number of items including duration , possibility of renewal , possibility for sublicensing , number of patents involved , and terms of payment including upfront fees , royalty rates , and minimum royalty . We dropped 5 licenses where no contract duration was speciﬁed , 16 licenses that stated inclusion of an upfront fee but where the amount was omitted for reasons of conﬁdentiality , and 14 because of lack of data needed to calculate the other variables in the regressions . The ﬁnal number of available license agreements was 192 . 1 These acronyms are drawn from the Security Exchange Commission ofﬁcial webpage ( available at https : / / www . sec . gov / forms # . VRPNlI54pNM , retrieved on the 26 March 2015 ) : they refer to Annual report ( 10 - K ) , Registration statement ( S - 1 ) and Current report ( 8 - K ) . Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 377 123 We integrated our dataset with two other data sources providing information on patents , countries , and industries , in order to get the data required to measure the other independent variables . We matched our database to the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) dataset ( Hall et al . 2001 ) and its 2002 update . Also , in line with empirical work on patent valuation ( Bloom and Van Reenen 2002 ) , we relied on stock market data to calculate our industry - level variables . We used the DataStream Global Price Index ( DGPI ) 2 which summarizes returns for the main listed ﬁrms , grouped by sector ( industry ) and worldwide , or by markets ( country or continent ) . To combine the DGPI data with our sample of licenses , we performed a two - stage correspondence process . First we matched DGPI and Thomson Financial ( TF ) codes by manually matching names . Having obtained TF codes , we used the correspondence table pro - vided by TF to match TF and SIC codes . At the end of this process , we grouped the observations / licenses into ﬁve macro industries , reﬂecting the TF nomenclature : Consumer Goods , Healthcare , High Technology , Industrials , and Materials . We dropped 17 observations that involved non - US licensees—because the payment structure of license agreements can be affected by country speciﬁc factors , making cross - country comparisons problematic ( Bessy and Brousseau 1999 ) . This left a sample of 175 licenses for 157 licensee ﬁrms , and a total of 652 USPTO patents ; 63 of these license agreements involved no upfront payment . Thus , our ﬁnal sample contained 112 observations . Corner solutions may have very different reasoning . One such alternative could be that the ﬁrms enter into the licensing contract as part of a greater tactical move which involves a more extensive collaborative arrangement than simple licensing . We used a Heckman approach to investigate whether dropping these 63 observations was driving the results . While the Heckman selection correction proved signiﬁcant , the overall conclusions were unchanged . 3 3 . 2 Measures 3 . 2 . 1 Dependent variable We want to analyze the factors explaining licensing agreement upfront fees . We recorded the amount ( in US dollars ) of the upfront fee paid by the licensee to sign the contract . As the upfront fee was highly right - skewed , we used its corresponding logarithm value as the dependent variable , Log ( upfront Payments ) . 3 . 2 . 2 Explanatory variables Contractual ﬂexibility We have argued that some patent licenses provide the licensee with the ﬂexibility to shelve a technology without having to incur further 2 Datastream is a proprietary dataset for macroeconomic analysis , own by Thomson Reuters , available at http : / / ﬁnancial . thomsonreuters . com / en / products / tools - applications / trading - investment - tools / datastream - macroeconomic - analysis . html ? gclid = CMPkserE - MQCFYHKtAodAjYA8g . 3 Kamien and Tauman ( 1984 ) debated zero upfront payments by studying the choice between ﬁxed fee and royalty - based contracts in a game theoretical context . This literature addresses the optimal contract design of licensing agreements ( see e . g . Katz and Shapiro 1985 ; Gallini and Wright 1990 ) . The Heckman approach results are depicted in the appendix in Table 3 . 378 Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 123 cost . However , the licensor can include contractual clauses that reduce this ﬂexibility during the licensing period ( Anand and Khanna 2000 ) . As discussed above , contractual ﬂexibility depends on the inclusion of minimum royalties , which must be paid even if the licensee decides to delay or abandon patent commercial - ization . The minimum royalty clause implies , therefore , a cost for not using the license and reduces the ﬂexibility of shelving for the licensee . Accordingly , we measure Contractual Flexibility as a dummy that equals 1 if the license agreement does not stipulate a minimum royalty and 0 otherwise . Market uncertainty This refers to uncertainty over potential demand for the licensed technology . A frequently used measure of market uncertainty is the volatility of stock returns , which acts as a forward - looking measure of the volatility of a ﬁrm or industry ( Bloom and Van Reenen 2002 ) . To calculate a measure of market uncertainty , we compute annual volatility in monthly DGPI returns for the year the license was granted , and for the licensee’s country and industry . If the license covers a whole continent , we calculate the standard deviation for the DGPI of that continent . If the license applies to several different countries , we calculate the average standard deviation of the monthly returns of the DGPI for those countries . Finally , for worldwide licenses , we calculate the standard deviation of the world DGPI . Technical uncertainty This variable relates to the technical feasibility of the patented technology , which ultimately affects its commercial potential ( Huchzer - meier and Lock 2001 ; A˚stebro and Dahlin 2005 ; Ziedonis 2007 ) . This depends on the novelty of the licensed technology . In line with previous studies ( Lanjouw and Schankerman 2001 ; Ziedonis 2007 ) , we measure this variable as the number of backwards citations in the licensed patent . Patents cite the state of the art at the time of the patent application . Thus , the number of backward citations is a measure of newness or radicalness of the patented technology , which means that fewer citations ( fewer prior art examples ) equate with higher technical uncertainty ( Ziedonis 2007 ) . Our measure of technical uncertainty is obtained by multiplying the number of back citations by - 1 since technical uncertainty increases as the number of back citations decreases . If the license involves more than one patent , the mean value is used . 3 . 2 . 3 Control variables We include a set of controls to account for aspects speciﬁc to the contractual structure of the license , the licensed patents , the licensing parties ( licensor and licensee ) and the industry . For structure , we control ﬁrst for the agreed Royalty Rate . From a theoretical and a practical point of view , it is generally agreed that , in revenue sharing contracts , such as licensing or franchising agreements , the royalty rate is negatively correlated to the upfront fee ( Lafontaine 1992 ; Lafontaine and Shaw 1999 ; Brickley 2002 ; Razgaitis 2003 ) . The reasoning is that higher expected royalty payments will reduce the downstream proﬁts that could accrue to the licensee , which , ceteris paribus , impacts negatively on the upfront fee that the licensee will be willing to pay . We measure this variable as the percentage royalty rate reported in the licensing agreement . We control for License Duration by utilizing the number of years until the license expires : longer contract duration Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 379 123 extends the time that the licensee will be able to exploit the license and thus potentially obtain cash ﬂows ( Parr and Sullivan 1996 ) . The value of the contract will depend also on whether or not the license is renewable . Renewable licenses allow the licensee to apply for an extension to the duration of the license , which will increase the revenue - generating potential of the license . Generally , this clause , which can favor both licensee and licensor , comes into operation after successful completion of the ﬁrst term of the license . License Renewable is a dummy that is equal to 1 if the licensee is granted the possibility to renew the license and 0 otherwise . Since some licenses include more than one patent , we include a measure of License Scope , intended as the number of the patents covered by the transaction . For licensed patents , we expect that the upfront fee will depend also on the inherent value of the object of the transaction ( the licensed patent ) . Studies of patent value based on patent data show that Patent Value can be proxied by the number of forward citations received by the target patent since its grant date ( e . g . Trajtenberg 1990 ; Harhoff et al . 2003 ; Reitzig 2004 ) . Accordingly , we control for the number of citations received at the time of signing of the licensing agreement , which means that we consider only those citations observable by the two parties when the contractual terms were being negotiated . The average number of forward citations is used if a license involves more than one patent . We include a set of controls regarding the relationship between the licensing parties . A dummy identiﬁes whether licensee’s and licensor’s core businesses ( 4 digit - SIC code ) are the same ( Business Proximity ) . Business proximity signals that both parties are likely to be similarly informed about the licensed technology and likely to share the same knowledge base ( Alchian and Demsetz 1972 ; Merchant and Schendel 2000 ; Vonortas and Kim 2006 ) . We account for licensor type by creating a dummy equal to 1 if the licensor is an individual ( Individual Licensor —usually the inventor ) . We would expect an individual licensor to be less likely to conclude a license that includes an upfront fee due to his or her lower bargaining power . 4 Also , individual licensors are less likely to have the expertise required to assess the monetary value of the patent license and thus less likely to try to extract this value from the licensee through an upfront payment . 5 We include controls for industry - speciﬁc effects . According to Fosfuri ( 2006 ) , higher market growth may reduce the rent dissipation effect for the licensor ( the propensity to license out its technologies will be greater , other things being equal ) since competition will be less ﬁerce . Higher market growth will also make the license more attractive to the licensee . In order to calculate market growth in a way that is consistent with our measure of market uncertainty , we compute annual DGPI variation by industry , country , and year . We follow the approach used for calculating market uncertainty when licenses refer to more than one country . We account for effects attributed to industry type by including a High - tech industry dummy deﬁned using the TF industry classiﬁcation . We categorized Healthcare and 4 For a discussion on the role of bargaining power in licensing contracts , see Sakakibara ( 2010 ) . 5 As noted by one of our reviewers , it would have been useful also to control for whether the licensor was an NPE . We , however , do not observe any NPEs in our dataset . 380 Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 123 High Technology Manufacturing as High - tech industries leaving Consumer Goods , Industrials , and Materials as our benchmark industries . Finally , we control for licensor’s and the licensee’s size . Other things being equal , a larger licensor will be less concerned about the inclusion or amount of an upfront fee , while a larger licensee will have less binding liquidity constraints , which will affect its ability to pay upfront . In fact , a large licensee is more likely to pay an upfront fee . We estimate two symmetric categorical dummy variables , Large Licensor and Large Licensee deﬁned as ﬁrms with more than 1000 employees . 3 . 3 Econometric model The econometric analysis potentially suffers from two different types of endogeneity . First , simultaneity bias , since the upfront payment and royalty rates are likely to be set simultaneously . Licensee and licensor agreements on royalty rates may depend , at least partly , on the level of the upfront payment and vice versa . This may bias estimates since royalty rates cannot be assumed to be uncorrelated with the error term , which violates one of the classical regression assumptions . The econometric remedy for this potential endogeneity bias is to use a simultaneous equation model ( SEM ) . However , in the context of our paper , running a SEM analysis would violate the assumptions of autonomous equations . Put differently , we cannot assume that the royalty payment is determined primarily by one of the parties , while the other primarily determines the upfront payment . It is more likely that both are determined jointly , by the two economic parties ( licensee and licensor ) . Royalty rates only appear as a control in the speciﬁcations and not of the main explanatory variables . For this reason the bias may be less severe for the overall conclusions with respect to the hypotheses . In order to validate our underlying assumption that this type of potential endogeneity does not inﬂuence overall conclusions , we ran the analysis excluding the royalty rate as a control . We found that this had no major implications for the estimates of the explanatory variables , which led us to conclude that the analysis is robust with respect to simultaneity . Second , the analysis could suffer from potential unobserved heterogeneity or omitted variables endogeneity , which potentially would lead to a violation of the assumption that the regressors are uncorrelated with the error term ( E ( x 0 i u i ) = 0 ) . In particular , the license agreements tell us little about the bargaining process between licensee and licensor ( Sakakibara 2010 ) . The controls may indicate something about the relative bargaining power but only imperfectly so . The outcome of a bargaining process is shaped by the relative bargaining powers of the involved parties . A number of factors shape relative bargaining power . First , the degree to which the input is irreplaceable shifts the bargaining power towards the supplier ( Pfeffer 1981 ) . Similarly , if there are very few or even no potential substitutes for the technology covered by the license agreement , the bargaining power shifts towards the licensor . Second , if it would be difﬁcult for the licensor to ﬁnd another potential licensee , the bargaining power shifts towards the licensee . These arguments refer to the cost associated with exiting the bargaining process ( Klein et al . 1978 ) . Third , organizations suffer from bounded rationality in the sense that there is not complete Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 381 123 information and the licensee , in particular , ﬁnds it difﬁcult to understand and assess the technology and its potential . The licensor is more likely to have the advantage in a situation of asymmetric information , and may choose to release only the information that makes the license agreement attractive , shifting the bargaining power to the supply side ( Pfeffer 1981 ) . While our analysis captures some of these factors by including some of the characteristics of the licensed technology and the licensee , it may be substantially biased by an omitted variable problem related to the relative bargaining powers of licensee and licensor . Econometrically , we mediate this by using an instrumental variables approach in which the ﬁrst stage equation regresses against the royalty rate , thereby assuming that the royalty rate partly expresses the relative bargaining power among the parties , and suffers from potential bias . In addition to the explanatory and control variables in the upfront payment speciﬁcation , we include two instrumental variables to net out the license - speciﬁc effects of the royalty rate . We generated Mundlak ( 1978 ) instruments by running regressions against the royalty rates using year and industry dummies , extracting parameter estimates and attaching these values to the observations . This provided us with two instruments , Time Tendency and Industry Tendency , which can be interpreted as standard practices for royalty rates across industries and time . A large share of the variation in contractual speciﬁcations can be attributed to consultancies , which tend to adopt a given practice that is predominant in the speciﬁc context and at that particular point in time . 6 Thus , we can consider these instruments as exogenous to the main equation in the analysis . We applied Hausman and Dubin – Wu – Hausman tests to check for endogeneity bias ; both indicated that standard ordinary least squares ( OLS ) did not suffer from the hypothesized endogeneity . However , for consistency , we report both the OLS and the instrumental variables regressions in the results section . All the regression results have clustered corrected standard errors since the data contain observations referring to different license agreements with the same licensee . The results can be considered robust based on application of a Huber – White - sandwich estimation technique . 3 . 3 . 1 Model validity and sensitivity Murray ( 2006 ) emphasizes that if correcting for endogeneity using an instrumental variables approach , it is essential to test for invalid and weak instruments . We used the Hansen J statistics to check for over - identiﬁcation and the Kleibergen – Paak Rank test to check for under - identiﬁcation . The statistics suggest we can reject both potential sources of bias . On the assumption that the instruments are uncorrelated with the ex - ante relative bargaining power of the ﬁrms , we can consider them useful to correct for unobserved heterogeneity . The statistics of the two tests are reported in Table 2 . We considered the potential bias caused by deleting observations with missing values ( potentially due to undisclosed information ) and excluding non - American 6 ‘‘Industrial Standards’’ is one of the most frequently used methods and standard practice for evaluating intellectual property rights , especially in a licensing context ( e . g .

We ﬁnd no reasons for concern . 4 Results Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics for the variables included in the analysis . About 71 % of the scrutinized license contracts are deﬁned as ﬂexible since they do not include a clause related to minimum royalties . The average duration of the contracts is a little over 16 years , and 11 % of the contracts were negotiated to be renewable . In 29 % of cases contracts were between parties from the same industry . In just under 19 % of contracts the licensor is an individual . The majority ( 58 % ) of our observations are from a high - tech industry . This is consistent with ﬁndings from studies on the industry distribution of license agreements ( Arora et al . 2001 ) . In 12 % of the contracts the licensee can be considered to be large with the corresponding number for licensors 30 % . Table 1 presents the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients . We have no reason to suspect the presence of multi - collinearity , conﬁrmed by a variance inﬂation factor below 5 . Table 2 reports the results of the regressions . The ﬁrst two columns are OLS results of the regression without and with the interactions between Technical and Market Uncertainty and No Contractual Flexibility respectively . Columns 3 and 4 show the instrumental variables regressions corresponding to column 1 of the OLS estimates , and report stage 1 and stage 2 respectively . Columns 5 and 6 are the ﬁrst and second stage instrumental variables estimates corresponding to the OLS estimates in column 2 . The regression coefﬁcients in column 1 are consistent with our hypotheses . In particular , the positive and statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcients of Contractual Flexibility ( 1 . 297 ) , Market Uncertainty ( 27 . 103 ) and Technical Uncertainty ( 0 . 026 ) signal that the upfront fee increases with Contractual Flexibility ( Hypothesis 1 ) and degrees of Market Uncertainty ( Hypothesis 2 ) and Technical Uncertainty ( Hypothesis 3 ) . These results are mirrored in the corresponding instrumental variables regression ( column 4 ) . Contractual ﬂexibility is insigniﬁcant . Column 2 includes the interaction terms of ﬂexibility and uncertainty to test Hypotheses 4a and 4b . The main coefﬁcient of Contractual Flexibility is positive ( 3 . 130 ) and statistically signiﬁcant . The main effect of Market Uncertainty is still positive and statistically signiﬁcant , but the interaction coefﬁcient is not statistically signiﬁcant . Contractual Flexibility , while being an attribute that per se increases the upfront fee that the licensee is willing to pay , does not seem to affect the licensee’s perception of market uncertainty . For Technical Uncertainty , the main coefﬁcient is insigniﬁcant , while the coefﬁcient of the interaction between Technical Uncertainty and Contractual Flexibility is positive ( 0 . 068 ) and weakly statistically signiﬁcant proving support for Hypothesis 4b . This set of results suggests that Contractual Flexibility is perceived by the licensee as particularly critical when the licensed patent ( s ) involve higher uncertainty about technical performance , since this ﬂexibility may allow low cost exit in the case of technical failure . These results are mirrored in the corresponding Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 383 123 instrumental variables results ( column 6 ) . However , here we see stronger signiﬁcance of the interaction between Contractual Flexibility and Technical Uncertainty providing stronger support for Hypothesis 4b . In column 6 we also see that the main term on Contractual Flexibility ( 2 . 501 ) becomes signiﬁcant at a 5 % level suggesting that the insigniﬁcance of this variable in column 4 to be a by - product of spurious correlations . Among the controls , we ﬁnd a positive estimate for License Duration , and being a High - tech Industry .

Among the two instruments , Industry Tendency tends to exhibit a positive impact on the royalty rate suggesting that there are practices that are adopted which are industry speciﬁc . It should be noted that practically all the signiﬁcant estimates conﬁrm our expectations . 5 Conclusions Patent licensing is increasingly more important for ﬁrms’ innovation strategies , affecting both the subsequent ability of the licensee to compete on his / her own ( e . g . Ceccagnoli et al . 2010 ; Cockburn et al . 2010 ; Leone and Reichstein 2012 ; Mulotte et al . 2013 ) and the ﬁnancial liquidity of the licensors that can be invested in subsequent innovation activities ( e . g . Kulatilaka and Lin 2006 ) . However , there is substantial evidence of the problems that are embedded in these agreements . According to empirical evidence from the annual Survey of the Licensing Executive Society , the difﬁculties involved in agreeing mutually acceptable contractual terms are among the main reasons for these negotiations failing . An appropriate payment structure design and especially the negotiation of the upfront fee are crucial . The difﬁculties in setting the payment structure are related primarily to uncertainty about the economic returns from the licensed patent . The results have some important ( and counterintuitive ) implications for negotiations over payment structures in patent license agreements in conditions of uncertainty . First , uncertainty in a patent license is not necessarily a negative element . Since uncertainty is associated with high potential upside value , the licensee might see it as positive and be willing to pay for it . Second , the negotiated ﬂexibility of the licensee needs to be considered alongside the payment structure : we show that a licensee will pay a higher upfront fee for more ﬂexible licensing terms . Also , the ﬂexibility to shelve the technology without having to incur further costs is valued particularly high by the licensee when the licensed patent presents higher technical uncertainty . This implies that a patent holder , trying to license out a patent on an early - stage technology , affected by high technical uncertainty , could make the license more attractive by offering greater contractual ﬂexibility to potential licensees , while still collecting an upfront fee . In other words , for the licensee a patent license involving no minimum royalty rates can be seen as providing the option to shelve the patent and commercialize it at a later moment without further cost ( Dechenaux et al . 2008 ) . The licensee will exploit the licensed patent only if the value of the underlying asset is higher than the further investment required to commercialize the patented technology . This shift in emphasis from payment structure to clauses may represent a smaller hurdle for coming to terms on contractual speciﬁcations . Especially when the prospective deal concerns patents representing greater uncertainty about future technical performance . Third , it is important to distinguish between market and technical uncertainty since they can have differing effects on negotiation of the upfront fee . While both effects on the upfront free are positive , it is more difﬁcult to hedge against technical uncertainty . Therefore , from the licensee’s perspective , while market uncertainty can be Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 387 123 mitigated through geographical diversiﬁcation , licensing agreements involving patents with higher technical uncertainty need to provide more ﬂexibility . This paper contributes to the existing literature in three ways . First , our analysis contributes to the discussion of patent license payment structures by revealing the role played by ﬂexibility and uncertainty in contract design . In particular , we argued that , for the licensee , ﬂexibility related to exploitation of the license is a valuable attribute . Second , we tested our hypotheses on an original cross - industry sample of 112 patent licenses . The study in this paper draws on a new dataset , compiled from careful analysis of original licensing contracts , on the basis of which we identiﬁed several contract terms , which we codiﬁed and integrated in the analysis . These are included in the main regressions to control for potential selection and endogeneity bias . Third , we focus on the licensee’s perspective , somewhat under - investigated in the licensing literature ( as also noted by Arora and Gambardella 2010 ; Ceccagnoli and Jiang 2013 ) , which mainly focuses on the patent - holder / licensor’s decision ( e . g . , Erutku and Richelle 2007 ; Fosfuri 2006 ; Kulatilaka and Lin 2006 ) . The paper also entails policy implications , since the licensing agreement is the most visible instrument for the development of Markets for Technology ( Arora et al . 2001 ) . The liquidity of these markets , depending on the success of licensing negotiation and therefore on the execution of licensing agreements , is a necessary condition to reduce R & D duplications and costs , to reap the beneﬁts of the diffused innovation , and , in the end , to ensure the technological progress at large . Hence , the understanding of the rationale underlying a license payment structure represents an urgent need both from licensing parties , preoccupied to sustain their daily businesses , as well as the policy makers , who are interested in easing the obstacles for value creation and distribution . 5 . 1 Limitations This study has some limitations . First , since our analysis required information on underlying technologies , we had to exclude license agreements where this information was conﬁdential . If conﬁdentiality is likely under particular market conditions , or when the asset has particular characteristics , the contract includes a particular clause on ﬂexibility , or conﬁdentiality increases with the level of the upfront payment , then the analysis would suffer from bias . Second , as already anticipated , we exclude from our analysis those licenses referring to collaboration or settlement agreements , cross - licensing , technology purchases and merger plans as their pricing might follow different criteria . Thus , our results cannot be extended to this type of licenses . Moreover , even in the restricted sample we analyze , it could be possible that the parties have motivations to sign the agreement that go beyond the ﬁnancial ﬂows . While these motivations might be potentially important ( and controlled for in our empirical analysis ) , we believe that the payment structure is still a crucial issue in the ( pure ) licensing agreements in our sample . Third , our analysis focuses on contractual speciﬁcations , market conditions , and the underlying asset . However , there may be ﬁnancial peculiarities related to the licensee that make the upfront fee higher . Licensees in ﬁnancial constraints may need to agree to less favorable terms since there is higher uncertainty associated with their negotiation . 388 Econ Polit Ind ( 2015 ) 42 : 371 – 394 123 Fourth , our empirical analysis has the advantage of referring to a broad and cross - industry sample of patent licenses , but for the same reason it was difﬁcult to use more ﬁne - grained measures as those used in single case studies . For example , our measure of contractual ﬂexibility might not capture all the dimensions of the original construct in full . More detailed information on the licensee’s rights with respect to renegotiation could provide a better understanding of the effect of contractual ﬂexibility in patent license agreements , but it was available only for a few licenses in our database . We are also aware that our proposed measure of market uncertainty has some limitations . However , it is very difﬁcult to identify a link between a speciﬁc technology and the related product and therefore to deﬁne a more ﬁne - grained measure of the market uncertainty speciﬁcally related to the licensed technology . For this reason , we have decided to rely on a measure that has already been used in previous empirical papers on R & D valuation ( e . g . Oriani and Sobrero 2008 ) and patent valuation ( e . g . , Bloom and Van Reenen 2002 ) . Finally , our measure of technical uncertainty is drawn from previous studies on similar topics ( e . g . , Ziedonis 2007 ) , but it is not free from potential criticism . Notwithstanding these limitations , we believe that investigating the payment structures of patent licenses within a new theoretical framework and within a broad sample of patent licenses , focusing on the licensee’s perspective , offer important theoretical , empirical , and practical contributions , and open new lines of research on licensing contracts and their role in ﬁrms’ innovation strategies .
