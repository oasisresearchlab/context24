Curr Opin Cell Biol 23 , 607 - 614 ( 2011 ) Integrin activation and trafficking 4 abstRAct Integrin adhesion receptors are essential for the normal function of most multicellular organisms , and defective integrin activation or - signaling is associated with an array of pathological conditions . Integrins are regulated by conformational changes , clustering , and trafficking , and regulatory mechanisms differ strongly between individual integrins and between cell types . Whereas integrins in circulating blood cells are activated by an inside - out - induced conformational change which favors high - affinity ligand binding , β 1 - integrins in adherent cells can be activated by force or clustering . In addition , endo - cytosis and recycling play an important role in the regulation of integrin - turnover and - redistribution in adherent cells , especially during dynamic processes such as cell migra - tion and invasion . Integrin trafficking is strongly regulated by their cytoplasmic tails , and the mechanisms are now being identified . IntRoDUctIon Integrins are heterodimeric αβ transmem - brane receptors that connect the extracel - lular matrix ( ECM ) to the cytoskeleton . In mammals , 18 α - and eight β - subunits assemble into 24 different integrins , which bind collagens , laminins , or proteins con - taining an Arg - Gly - Asp ( RGD ) sequence . In addition , several integrins bind soluble ligands or cellular receptors ( Figure 1 ) . Many integrins are known to adopt low - , intermediate - , and high - affinity conforma - tions , and these exist in a dynamic equi - librium with one another . An increase in the proportion of heterodimers adopting high - affinity conformations is termed inte - grin activation , and can be induced either by cytoplasmic events ( ‘inside - out’ activa - tion ; Figure 2A ) , or by extracellular factors ( ‘outside - in’ activation ) . Ligand - binding triggers integrin clustering ( avidity ) , inte - grin connection to the cytoskeleton , and the formation of macromolecular adhe - sion complexes ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , integrin - ligand interactions induce a plethora of ‘outside - in’ events such as cell spreading and migration , ECM assembly , and the activation of several signal trans - duction pathways that regulate cell prolif - eration , survival , and gene expression ( 1 ) . Most integrins engage the actin cytoskel - eton , and a range of integrin - containing actin - associated adhesive structures has been described , including focal com - plexes , focal adhesions ( FAs ) , fibrillar adhesions ( FBs ) , podosomes , and invado - podia ( 2 ) ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast , integ - rin α 6 β 4 connects to the intermediate filament system , and localizes to hemides - mosomes ( 3 ) . The relatively short α - and β - cytoplasmic tails ( 13 - 70 amino acids , except for β 4 ) contain docking sites for a variety of proteins that control integrin activation , recruitment to adhesion sites , and trafficking . Here , we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how these processes are regulated by integrin cytoplasmic tails , with emphasis on differ - ences between adherent and non - adherent cells , and between individual integrins . 131 InteGRIn actIVatIon MecHanIsMs Figure 1 Mammalian integrins and their ligands . Ligands for leukocyte integrins include E - cadherin , fibrinogen , factor X , intercellular adhesion molecule , inactive complement factor 3b , vascular cell adhesion molecule , and von Willebrand Factor . RGD - containing ligands include bone sialoprotein , fibronectin , latency - associated - peptide of transforming growth factor - β 1 / 3 , nephronectin , osteopontin , thrombospondin , and vitronectin . Integrin activation in non - adherent cells such as leukocytes and platelets is rapid , reversible , and tightly - controlled , and this process is best - exemplified by the rapid enhancement of ligand - binding capac - ity of integrin α IIb β 3 following platelet activation with agonists such as thrombin . In resting platelets , the bent , low - affinity conformation of α IIb β 3 is stabilized by a ‘clasp’ formed between the GFFKR sequence in α IIb and the HDRxE motif in β 3 , most importantly a salt bridge between R995 and D723 ( Figure 3 ) ( 4 ) , and this mechanism is thought to help prevent inappropriate platelet aggregation which could lead to thrombosis . Activa - tion of cytoplasmic signaling downstream of G - protein coupled receptors ( such as the thrombin receptor ) leads to disrup - tion of the salt bridge , and the subsequent separation ( ‘unclasping’ ) of the cyto - plasmic tails triggers an allosteric change to favor the extended , high - affinity inte - grin conformation . The last step of this inside - out mechanism is the binding of the four - point - one / ezrin / radixin / moesin ( FERM ) - containing head - domain of talin to the membrane - proximal ( MP ) - NPxY motif and an additional MP region of the β 3 cytotail ( Figures 2A , 3 ) ( 4 , 5 ) . Inside - out activation also requires kindlin - 3 , a member of the kindlin family of proteins whose FERM domains bind the mem - brane - distal ( MD ) - NxxY motif in β - tails ( 6 ) . Loss of talin or kindlin - 3 from plate - lets prevents platelet adhesion and aggre - 132 Integrin activation and trafficking 4 gation in mice , and kindlin - 3 - deficient leukocytes fail to adhere to endothelial cells ( 7 - 10 ) . The phenotypes of talin - or kindlin - 3 - knockout mice resemble those of the human disorders Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia ( haemorrhages due to defects in α IIb β 3 on platelets ) , leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome - I ( LAD - I ; immunodeficiency due to defects in β 2 - integrins on leukocytes ) , and LAD - III ( immunodeficiency and haemorrhages due to combined defects in function of β 1 - , β 2 - , and β 3 - integrins ) . Indeed , since the discovery of kindlin - 3 , mutations in its gene have been disclosed in several LAD - III patients ( 11 ) . Tyrosine - phosphorylation of the NPxY / NxxY motifs modulates the affinity of integrin - binding proteins in vitro and has been proposed to act as a molecular switch to inhibit talin - binding and allow for the binding of tensin or Dok - 1 , a negative regu - Figure 2 Integrin activation and adhesion assembly . ( A ) In leukocytes and platelets , ‘inside - out activation’ is triggered by a cytoplasmic chain - of - events that terminates in the binding of talin and kindlin - 3 to the β - subunit , triggering a shift from the low - affinity conformation ( bent with a closed head ) toward the intermediate - ( extended with closed head ) and high - ( extended with open head ) affinity conformation . Ligand - binding induces ‘outside - in’ events including talin - mediated connection to the actin cytoskeleton and cell spreading , integrin clustering , and activation of various signal transduction cascades . ( B ) Types of integrin - containing adhesion complexes : ( 1 ) Focal complexes ( red arrows ) are Rac - induced peripheral adhesions ( ≤1 µm ) that stabilize membrane protrusions such as lamellipodia , whereas focal adhesions ( yellow arrows ) are Rho - induced tensioned structures ( 1 - 5 µm ) that represent major sites of signaling . Red , F - actin ; green , phospho - tyrosines ; blue , nuclei .

Red , F - actin ; green , β 4 . 133 lator of integrin activation ( 12 ) . The motifs are phosphorylated in β 3 after ligand - binding , and prevention of this event by Y > F substitutions causes defects in plate - let aggregation and a bleeding defect in mice ( 13 ) . However , Y > F mutations in the NPxY motifs of β 1 in mice do not cause any abnormalities whereas Y > A mutations lead to a complete loss - of - function , suggesting that in β 1 - integrins , structural integrity of the NPxY motifs is required but tyrosine - phosphorylation is dispensable . Further - more , mice carrying a D759A substitution in β 1 ( which prevents formation of a salt bridge ) are normal , suggesting that also the salt bridge is not essential for β 1 - integrin function in vivo ( 14 , 15 ) . As integrins in adherent cells need generally to be in an ‘on’ - rather than ‘off’ - state , the bent conformation is less likely to predominate in these cells . Ne - vertheless , the turnover of adhesion com - plexes that occurs for example during cell migration , requires dynamic regulation of integrin - ligand binding . Conforma - tional changes in α 5 β 1 from the bent to the extended conformation have been observed in FAs , but the mechanism that triggers the unbending remains to be elu - cidated ( 16 ) . Probably , integrin activation in adherent cells occurs by an ‘outside - in’ mechanism ( e . g . the high concentration of available ligand in the ECM ) , by regu - lation of avidity ( integrin clustering ) , or by force . For example , α 5 β 1 can be acti - vated by cytoskeletal tension generated by myosin - II , in response to a stiff ECM . Under low tension , α 5 β 1 forms ‘relaxed’ bonds to the RGD - site of fibronectin ( FN ) , whereas under high tension , α 5 β 1 binds both the RGD and the synergy site , leading to stronger , ‘tensioned’ bonds ( 17 ) . The lifetime of α 5 β 1 - FN bonds is thus increased by tensile force ( 18 ) . Inter - estingly , neither force nor high avidity seems to influence talin - induced molecu - lar extension of α IIb β 3 ( 19 ) . This indi - cates that talin - regulated α IIb β 3 activa - tion may solely occur through conforma - tional changes , whereas integrin - mediated adhesion in adherent cells may depend principally on talin - dependent increases in integrin avidity through the formation of antiparallel talin homodimers , and / or connection to the actin cytoskeleton via the talin rod - domain ( Figure 2A ) . The latter is strongly suggested by intriguing observations in Drosophila ; demonstrat - ing that both talin - and integrin - null muta - tions cause wing blistering , however in the absence of talin , integrin - ligand binding is not impaired but integrins fail to connect to the cytoskeleton ( 20 ) . Talin may also indirectly promote integrin function , by preventing the binding of the negative reg - ulator filamin ( 21 ) . Filamin competes with talin for binding of the β - tail , and its affin - ity is decreased by phosphorylation of the threonine / serine ( T / S ) - rich region that separates the two NPxY motifs ( Figure 3 ) ( 22 ) . T / S phosphorylation is thus thought to act as a molecular switch that increases talin - binding and integrin activation , and this is supported by observations that 1 ) T / S - phosphorylation occurs in β 1 , β 2 , β 3 , and β 7 after stimulation with integrin - activating agonists , and 2 ) conservative and non - conservative mutations of the T / S residues in β 3 or β 1A decrease inte - grin activation and cell adhesion ( 4 ) . The importance of T / S - phosphorylation in vivo remains to be determined . The kindlins are also important for inte - grin function in adherent cells . In humans , 134 Integrin activation and trafficking 4 kindlin - 1 mutations cause Kindler syn - drome , a skin - blistering disorder that resembles loss - of - function of α 3 β 1 in the epidermis , and gene targeting of kindlin - 1 and - 2 compromises integrin - mediated adhesion in mice ( 23 - 25 ) . However , the molecular mechanism remains elusive and requires further investigation . First , the effects of kindlins are cell - type - specific , as kindlin - 3 overexpression enhances integrin activation in macrophages but not in CHO cells ( 9 ) . Second , kindlins exert integrin - specific effects , because co - expression of kindlin - 1 or kindlin - 2 with talin results in activation of α IIb β 3 but inhibition of α 5 β 1 in CHO cells , and kindlin - 2 regulates adhesion to vitronec - tin whereas kindlin - 3 regulates adhesion to FN in endothelial cells ( 26 , 27 ) . Third , kindlins can regulate integrins indepen - dent of activation , as cell adhesion and cell spreading were compromised in kindlin - 1 - deficient - keratinocytes , whereas integrin activation was not impaired ( 28 ) . In summary , it is clear that mecha - nisms of activation are not generic for all Figure 3 Sequences of integrin cytoplasmic tails . Depicted are the sequences of the human β 1A , β 1D , β 2 , β 3 , β 5 , β 6 , and β 7 subunits ( β 4 and β 8 have been omitted because of poor sequence homology ) , and the human α IIb , α 2 , and α 5 subunits .

The green box represents the ‘clasp’ that maintains the low - affinity conformation , formed between the HDRxE region ( with the D - residue essential for the salt bridge in red ) , and the GFFKR motif in the α - subunit .

The subunits to which binding has been demonstrated are indicated in brackets , and dashed lines indicate that the exact binding sites have not been mapped . 135 integrins . Instead , different integrins are subject to different regulatory mecha - nisms , which have evolved to meet varying biological requirements . Such diversity is at least in part accomplished through sequence differences among β - tails , which can strongly influence the affinities for binding proteins ( 29 ) . This is illustrated by the recently resolved structures of various β - tails in complex with talin - 1 or talin - 2 ; the tightest link is formed between β 1D and talin - 2 , which are predominant in the myotendinous junctions of striated muscle , and has to withstand the forces of muscle contraction ( 30 ) . InteGRIn cYtoPlasMIc MotIfs anD tHe ReGUlatIon of InteGRIn tRAffIcKInG Over the past years , it has been firmly established that integrin trafficking in adherent cells is important for integrin - dependent cell adhesion , spreading and migration , as well as cancer cell invasion . Integrin trafficking regulates FA disassem - bly , matrix turnover , and localized integrin redistribution to new adhesion sites , for example at the leading edge in migrat - ing cells ( 31 ) . Trafficking mechanisms include the delivery of newly synthesized integrins via the biosynthetic - secretory pathway , integrin internalization , and recycling of internalized integrins . Early reports have suggested that talin - binding at the endoplasmic reticu - lum ( ER ) may regulate delivery of newly synthesized integrins to the membrane via myosin - mediated vesicular transport along actin filaments ( 32 ) . Talin - binding exposes the GFFKR sequence which is a suggested ER - export signal , and muta - tions in this sequence cause reduced surface expression , as observed in some GT patients . It remains unclear how talin - integrin binding at the ER is regulated , and how this affects integrin conformation . Using conformation - specific antibodies , it was recently suggested that β 1 - integrins are in the bent conformation after associa - tion with α - subunits at the ER , and that they stay like this as they journey through the Golgi to the plasma membrane ( 33 ) . Integrin internalization occurs through clathrin - dependent and clathrin - indepen - dent ( via caveolae or macropinocytosis ) mechanisms , and many integrins can follow more than one route into the cell . Caveolar internalization of α 5 β 1 and FN regulates matrix turnover , and early reports have shown that also α 2 β 1 is endocytosed in a caveolin - dependent manner , which may involve a direct asso - ciation of protein kinase C α ( PKC α ) with the β 1 - tail ( 34 , 35 ) . Recently , it has become clear that α v β 3 can be internal - ized by macropinocytosis from dorsal ruffles that are induced by platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) stimulation . The internalized integrins then transit through recycling endosomal compartments to repopulate newly formed FAs on the ventral surface ( 36 ) . Clathrin - mediated integrin endocytosis is emerging as an important mechanism of adhesion disas - sembly during cell migration , and recent studies have identified many of the mol - ecules involved in this process . Although there is an early study suggesting that α v β 5 binds clathrin directly , it is gener - 136 Integrin activation and trafficking 4 ally thought that most integrins require adaptor proteins to recruit them into clathrin - coated pits . Indeed , clathrin adap - tors such as Disabled ( Dab ) - 2 and adaptor protein - 2 ( AP - 2 ) accumulate at or near FAs shortly before their disassembly . Fur - thermore , dynamin - dependent integrin internalization and transport along micro - tubules to Rab5 - positive endosomes has been reported following manipulations that lead to synchronous disruption of FAs ( 37 , 38 ) . Accordingly , depletion of clathrin or any of these adaptors leads to increased integrin surface expression and reduced migration ( 37 - 39 ) . In addi - tion to Dab - 2 , the clathrin adaptor Numb localizes in FAs at the leading edge of migrating cells to mediate integrin endo - cytosis and migration ( 40 ) . Studies in Drosophila now indicate that clathrin - and Rab5 - dependent integrin turnover is also important in vivo , in particular for the maintenance of the myotendinous junction ( 41 ) . NPxY motifs are canoni - cal signals for clathrin - mediated endocy - tosis of plasma membrane receptors , and Numb and Dab - 2 bind respectively to the MP - NPxY and the MD - NxxY of β - tails ( 29 ) . Several observations suggest that mutations in these motifs impair inte - grin internalization . First , Y > A substitu - tion in the MD - NxxY of β 3A impairs the β 3 - endonexin - mediated internalization of ligand - bound integrins . Second , F > A substitutions in either one of the NPxF motifs of β 2 - integrins compromises their endocytosis . Third , Y > F mutations in both NPxY motifs of β 1 reduces clathrin - dependent integrin endocytosis in fibro - blasts ( 42 ) . The latter result is surprising as β 1 YY / FF mice are apparently normal , and it suggests that another endocytic mecha - nism can compensate for loss of clathrin - dependent internalization of β 1 - integrins in vivo ( 14 , 15 ) . Indeed , endocytosis of β 1 YY / FF can be rescued by overexpres - sion of Rab21 and this is most likely via the upregulation a clathrin - independent pathway ( 42 ) . Despite these advances , it remains unclear how the individual NPxY motifs regulate integrin trafficking , and through which proteins . Furthermore , the interplay between internalization and activation requires further investigation . It has been suggested that upon microtu - bule - induced FA disassembly , active inte - grins endocytose more rapidly than inac - tive integrins ( 38 ) . In addition , whereas some reports find Dab - 2 enrichment in FAs , others suggest that Dab - 2 is required for bulk endocytosis of inactive integrins , since it colocalizes with β 1 - integrins dis - tributed over the entire cell surface ( 39 ) . The possibility that internalization of active and inactive integrins is regulated by separate pathways is intriguing , but has so far only been substantiated for α 5 β 1 . Indeed , selective internalization of active α 5 β 1 from FBs and vesicular intracellular transport along actin filaments is medi - ated by Neuropilin1 - and GIPC - mediated connection to myosinVI , whereas endocy - tosis of inactive α 5 β 1 occurs by Neuropi - lin1 - independent mechanisms ( 43 ) . Internalized integrins may be either returned to the plasma membrane or routed to lysosomes for degradation , and the decision to recycle or degrade internal - ized α 5 β 1 is likely influenced by its ubi - quitination . In migrating fibroblasts , the α 5 - tail is ubiquitinated upon FN binding , and this is required to direct FN - α 5 β 1 complexes to lysosomes . It was suggested that ubiquitination functions to prevent 137 endosomal accumulation of ligated inte - grins , which may interfere with cell signal - ing and migration ( 44 ) . However , most internalized integrins are not degraded , but are returned to the plasma mem - brane , and a number of growth factors , kinases , and GTPases of the Rab and Arf families are now known to influence this process . For example , PDGF stimulates rapid , short - loop recycling of internal - ized α v β 3 from early endosomes ( EEs ) , whereas α 5 β 1 travels from EEs to the perinuclear recycling compartment ( PNRC ) and is then recycled via a longer loop to the plasma membrane ( Figure 4 ) ( 45 ) . Short - loop recycling depends on Rab4 and protein kinase D1 ( PKD1 ) , the latter of which binds directly to the β 3 - tail ( Figure 3 ) . By contrast , long - loop recy - cling requires Rab11 , Arf6 , and protein kinase B ( PKB ) / Akt ( 46 , 47 ) . PKB phos - phorylates the Arf - GAP with coiled - coil , ANK repeat and PH domain - containing protein1 ( ACAP1 ) , which then associ - ates directly with the β 1 - tail and mediates recycling of β 1 - integrins from recycling endosomes ( Figure 4 ) ( 47 ) . Different routes of integrin recycling can exert dif - ferences in Rho GTPase signaling and directional migration ( 48 ) . The α - tails of integrins are now known to recruit GTPases and other factors that control their trafficking . Rab21 is a Rab5 - related GTPase which associates directly with a region of the α 2 - and α 5 - tails that is close to the GFFKR motif ( 49 ) . Very recently , it has become clear that p120RasGAP also binds to this portion of the α - tail , and does so in a way to replace Rab21 , which then mediates integrin Figure 4 Integrin trafficking mechanisms regulate adhesion ( dis - ) assembly and migration . Integrin endocytosis is mediated by Rab5 and Rab21 . From early endosomes , integrins are recycled to the membrane either via a short loop that involves Rab4 , or via the perinuclear recycling compartment in a Rab11 - or Rab25 - dependent manner . Alternatively , they are delivered to late endosomes / lysosomes for degradation , which may require α - chain ubiquitination . Integrins can also be redistributed to dorsal ruffles after PDGF - stimulation , after which uptake occurs by macropinocytosis . They are then delivered to endosomes and exocytosed at the ventral surface .

These results indicate that as integrins travel from one intracellular compartment to the other they are able to swap proteins that are associated with their tails in a way that supports their recycling . Possibly , other Rabs also bind directly to the α - tail , and it is conceivable that sequence differ - ences in the region adjacent to the GFFKR are responsible for the integrin - specific effects of Rabs on individual heterodimers ( 31 , 42 , 45 , 48 , 49 ) . Moreover , this might explain the long - standing observation that various integrins traffic with differ - ent kinetics depending on the α - subunit ; whereas rapid and constitutive endocy - tosis occurs for α 5 β 1 and α M β 2 , no or slow endocytosis is observed for α 3 β 1 , α 4 β 1 and α L β 2 ( 31 ) . Interestingly , the Rabs contain phosphotyrosine - binding domains that recognize NPxY motifs , and can thus potentially also bind to β - tails . Indeed , Rab25 interacts with the β 1 - tail , and drives recycling of α 5 β 1 to the tips of pseudopods in invading cancer cells ( 51 ) . In conclusion , motifs in the cytotails of integrins are key to the regulation of integrin endocytosis and recycling via a number of pathways , and although many players in these processes have now been identified , major issues still need to be resolved . These include the function of the individual NPxY motifs in traffick - ing of various integrins , the role of the α - subunit , and the interplay between acti - vation and internalization . conclUsIons Our knowledge of the diverse mechanisms of integrin regulation has steadily increased over the years , and it is now clear that mechanisms of integrin activation and trafficking differ between different integrins and across cell types . Future work requires more focus on how integrin trafficking is regulated by the α - subunits and associated proteins , and by the two NPxY motifs in the β - subunits . Furthermore , the interplay between trafficking and activation merits further exploration , which will reveal how differential trafficking of active and inactive integrins is regulated , and via which proteins . acKnoWleDGeMents We apologise to all authors whose work has been omitted due to space restrictions , and for not always citing primary literature .
