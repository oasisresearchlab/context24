Patching ⁎ School of Biomedical Sciences and Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology , University of Leeds , UK a b s t r a c t a r t i c l e i n f o Article history : Received 27 February 2013 Received in revised form 25 April 2013 Accepted 29 April 2013 Available online 9 May 2013 Keywords : Surface plasmon resonance Membrane protein Ligand binding Sensors Kinetics Drug discovery Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) spectroscopy is a rapidly developing technique for the study of ligand bind - ing interactions with membrane proteins , which are the major molecular targets for validated drugs and for current and foreseeable drug discovery . SPR is label - free and capable of measuring real - time quantitative binding af ﬁ nities and kinetics for membrane proteins interacting with ligand molecules using relatively small quantities of materials and has potential to be medium - throughput . The conventional SPR technique requires one binding component to be immobilised on a sensor chip whilst the other binding component in solution is ﬂ owed over the sensor surface ; a binding interaction is detected using an optical method that measures small changes in refractive index at the sensor surface . This review ﬁ rst describes the basic SPR ex - periment and the challenges that have to be considered for performing SPR experiments that measure mem - brane protein – ligand binding interactions , most importantly having the membrane protein in a lipid or detergent environment that retains its native structure and activity . It then describes a wide - range of mem - brane protein systems for which ligand binding interactions have been characterised using SPR , including the major drug targets G protein - coupled receptors , and how challenges have been overcome for achieving this . Finally it describes some recent advances in SPR - based technology and future potential of the technique to screen ligand binding in the discovery of drugs .

Introduction Membrane proteins are coded by up to 30 % of the open reading frames in known genomes [ 1 – 3 ] , they have important roles in many bi - ologicalprocesses ( e . g . transport ofionsandmolecules , controloftrans - membrane potential , generation and transduction of energy , signal recognition and transduction , catalysis of chemical reactions ) and mu - tations in membrane proteins have been linked with a number of human diseases [ 4 – 10 ] . The molecular targets for around 50 – 60 % of current validated medicines are membrane proteins and they remain the principal target for new drug discovery [ 11 – 17 ] . Owing to the dif ﬁ - culties in applying the main biophysical techniques for high - resolution protein structure determination : X - ray crystallography and NMR spec - troscopy , the number of structures of membrane proteins is still rela - tively few , contributing less than 1 % of protein structures in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) [ 18 ] , thus limiting the amount of information available for traditional structure - based drug design . At the time of writing , there are high - resolution structures determined for only seventeen unique G - protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) [ 19 ] , which representthelargestclassofmembraneproteindrugtarget . Othermem - brane protein drug targets include cytokine receptors , tyrosine and histi - dine kinase receptors , antibody receptors , ligand - and voltage - gated ion channels and transport proteins . It is important to have a range of chemical , biochemical and biophysical techniques available for charac - terisation of ligand binding by membrane proteins and for screening libraries of compounds as potential drug candidates . A developing tech - nique in this respect is surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) spectroscopy , which is label - free and enables measurement of real - time quanti ﬁ cation of ligand - binding af ﬁ nities and kinetics usingrelatively smallamounts of membraneproteininanativeornative - likeenvironmentandhaspoten - tial to be medium - throughput . Following a description of the SPR exper - iment , thisreview ﬁ rstconsidersthechallengesassociatedwithapplying SPR - based methods to characterise ligand binding by membrane pro - teins and then demonstrates how some of these have been overcome with examples of its application to a range of speci ﬁ c membrane protein systems . In some cases , this involves combination with results from other experimental techniques and with molecular modelling . Finally it describes some recent developments in SPR - based technology and con - siders its future potential for drug discovery with membrane protein targets . 2 . The surface plasmon resonance experiment Surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) uses an optical method to mea - sure a change in refractive index of the medium in close vicinity of a metal surface that can be used to monitor the binding of analyte molecules to receptor molecules immobilised on the metal surface [ 20 , 21 ] . This exploits the phenomenon of surface plasmon generation in thin metal ﬁ lms and the total internal re ﬂ ection of light at a surface - solution interface to produce an electromagnetic ﬁ lm or eva - nescent wave that extends a short distance ( up to 300 nm ) into the solution ( see other reviews for a more detailed description of the theory behind surface plasmon generation [ 22 – 27 ] and references therein ) . SPR has predominantly been developed and performed using BIAcore ™ technology [ 20 , 28 – 36 ] with the ﬁ rst commercial in - strument in 1991 ; an illustration of the basic instrument set up is shown in Fig . 1A . The surface is typically a thin ﬁ lm of gold on a glass support that forms the ﬂ oor of a small - volume ( less than 100 nl ) ﬂ ow cell through which an aqueous solution is passed contin - uously . In order to detect the binding of an analyte molecule to a re - ceptor molecule , the receptor molecule is usually immobilised on the sensor surface and the analyte molecule is injected in the aqueous solution through the ﬂ ow cell . Polarised light from a laser source is di - rected through a prism to the under surface of the gold ﬁ lm where surface plasmons are generated at a critical angle of the incident light . This absorption of light is seen as a decrease in intensity of the re ﬂ ected light . The critical angle is dependent on the refractive index of the medium within 300 nm of the gold surface and changes when molecules bind to the surface , e . g . when analyte molecules bind to immobilised receptor molecules ( Fig . 1B ) . The real - time response of the SPR experiment is usually presented in the form of a sensorgram ( Fig . 1C ) . If interaction between the immobilised receptor molecules and the analyte molecules occurs , the refractive index at the surface of the gold ﬁ lm changes and this is seen as an increase in signal intensity . Resonance or response units ( RU ) are used to de - scribe the increase in the signal , where 1 RU is equal to a critical angle shift of 10 − 4 deg . At the start of the experiment all immobilised receptor molecules have not been exposed to analyte molecules and the RU value corresponds to the starting critical angle a . Analyte mol - ecules are injected into the ﬂ ow cell ; if they bind to the immobilised receptor molecules , there is an association phase during which bind - ing sites become occupied and the shape of this curve can be used to measure the rate of association ( k on ) . When steady - state is achieved the RU value corresponds to the changed ﬁ nal critical angle b . This maximum RU value relates to the concentrations of immobilised re - ceptor and analyte molecules and so can be used to measure the bind - ing af ﬁ nity ( K D ) . When analyte molecules are removed from the continuous ﬂ ow there is a dissociation phase during which binding sites become unoccupied and the shape of this curve can be used to measure the rate of dissociation ( k off ) . The surface can then be regenerated and returned to the critical angle a to start the experi - ment again . The lowest detectable concentration in the SPR experi - ment depends on a number of factors including the molecular weight , optical property and binding af ﬁ nity of the analyte molecule 44 S . G . Patching / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838 ( 2014 ) 43 – 55 as well as the surface coverage of the receptor molecule . The SPR re - sponse correlates with a change in mass concentration on the sensor chip surface and therefore depends on the molecular weight of the analyte molecule in relation to the number of receptor sites on the sensor surface . If the term R max describes the maximum binding ca - pacity of the surface receptor molecule for the analyte molecule in RU , the theoretical R max is calculated using the equation R max = ( MW analmol / MW recmol ) × R rec × V rec , where MW analmol is the molecu - lar weight of the analyte molecule , MW recmol is the molecular weight of the receptor molecule , R rec is the response obtained from the re - ceptor molecule and V rec is the valency of the receptor molecule / proposed stiochiometry of the interaction [ 37 , 38 ] . Achieving conditions with anoptimum R max is important for measuringthe binding kinetics of an interaction . A range of ‘ sensor - chips ’ are commercially available for use with SPR instruments allowing the user to immobilise their receptor mol - ecule of interest to the gold surface [ 20 , 39 – 42 ] . For example , the hydrophobic association ( HPA ) sensor chip contains long - chain alkanethiol molecules covalently attached to the gold surface . Vesi - cles are adsorbed on to the surface forming a supported lipid mono - layer . Most chips other than HPA are based on carboxylated dextran surfaces to allow preconcentration and / or chemistry to be performed . For example , the L1 chip allows formation of lipid bilayers ; its surface has a dextran matrix modi ﬁ ed with hydrophobic anchors enabling 300 nm YY Y Y Y Y Analyte flow Gold film Glass slide Receptors Prism Lightsource Detector Polarisedlight Reflectedlight a b α a b Critical angle I n t e n s i t y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Time R es pon se un i t s a b a Association → K on Dissociation → K off Regeneration A C B Concentration → K d Fig . 1 .

SPR uses an optical method to measure the refractive index near to a sensor surface ; this exploits total internal re ﬂ ection of light at a surface - solution interface to produce an electromagnetic ﬁ eld or evanescent wave that extends a short distance ( up to 300 nm ) into the solution .

Inordertodetectthebindingofananalytemoleculeto a receptor molecule , the receptor molecule is usually immobilised onthe sensorsurface and the analyte molecule is injected inthe aqueous solution through the ﬂ ow cell .

When a steady - state is achieved ( all binding sites occupied in this example ) the RU correspond to the changed ﬁ nal critical angle b . This maximum RU relates to the concentrations of immobilised receptor and analyte molecules and so can be used to measure the binding af ﬁ nity ( K D ) . When analyte molecules are removed from the continuous ﬂ ow there is a dissociation phase during which binding sites become unoccupied and the shape of this curve can be used to measure the rate of dissociation ( k off ) . The surface can then be regenerated and returned to the critical angle a to start the experiment again .

Some have functional groups ( e . g . amino , thiol , aldehyde or carboxyl ) to en - able use of speci ﬁ c chemistry for the covalent immobilisation of re - ceptor molecules on to the surface . If it is not possible to directly immobilise the receptor molecule on to the surface , then a secondary molecule such as an antibody can be used . An antibody that recog - nises the receptor of interest is covalently immobilised on the surface using speci ﬁ c chemistry then the receptor molecule is ‘ captured ’ on to the surface by the antibody before exposure to analyte molecules . Since the sensor chips can usually be regenerated after each experi - ment , by washing off all analyte molecules , the same chip can be used to test for binding of a number of different analyte molecules . 3 . Challenges for characterising membrane protein – ligand interactions using SPR As with any structural or functional investigation with membrane proteins , use of SPR to characterise their interaction with ligands re - quires the protein to be in its original membranes or reconstituted in a suitable membrane mimetic or solubilised in a suitable detergent that retains the native structure , conformation and activity of the pro - tein as far as possible . For characterisation of ligand binding , retaining activity is obviously of most importance . This challenge usually has to be combined with immobilisation or capture of the membrane pro - tein on to the sensor surface . Some of the approaches that have been developed to achieve this , which include covalent attachment by selective chemistry and capture by antibodies or af ﬁ nity tags com - bined with solubilisation and reconstitution strategies , are described along with application to speci ﬁ c membrane protein systems in the following section of this review . Once the membrane protein is attached to the sensor surface , a suitable ligand molecule has to be chosen for introduction into the analyte ﬂ ow to test for protein activity . The choice of ligand molecule will depend on the membrane protein system under investigation and the aim of the intended experiments , e . g . screening a speci ﬁ c binding site for ligand speci ﬁ city . This should include appropriate control experiments to show that the observed ligand binding activity is speci ﬁ c , e . g . using a different membrane protein or a different li - gand as a negative control . It may be useful to screen a range of lipid reconstitution or detergent solubilisation conditions for the membrane protein under investigation to identify those that give the highest protein activity and stability . The measured ligand bind - ing activity and speci ﬁ city determined from the SPR experiment can also be validated by applying other biochemical or biophysical tech - niques to the membrane protein reconsitituted or solubilised under similar conditions , e . g . using a radioligand binding assay . The struc - tural integrity of the protein can also be tested in a similar way . Such considerations are discussed along with application to speci ﬁ c membrane protein systems in the following section of this review . Having the membrane protein attached to the sensor surface under lipid - reconstituted or detergent - solubilised conditions that retain the active conformation of the protein is an important consideration . A rig - orous demonstration of ligand binding and activity , as described above , is a good indication of a membrane protein retaining its correct con - formation . Further demonstration of a correct conformation can be achievedbyobservingthebindingofconformation - dependentantibod - ies to the membrane protein of interest . A homogenous surface with all receptor molecules in the same orientation where the ligand binding site is directed towards the analyte ﬂ ow rather than towards the sensor surface is alsoanimportantconsideration and should assistef ﬁ ciency of the experiment . This is achievable by capture methods that use af ﬁ nity tags or antibodies where the receptor molecules are oriented by attach - ment from a common site , but this does need prior knowledge about the amino acid sequence and / or structure of the receptor molecule under investigation . For some membrane proteins , access of the ligand to both sides of the protein may be necessary to elicit the binding response . This can be hindered if one side of the protein is used for at - tachment to the sensor surface , so experimental systems have been de - veloped that do allow access to both sides . These considerations are described along with application to speci ﬁ c membrane protein systems in the following section of this review . SincetheSPReffectisduetodetectionofamasschangeatthesensor surface , where binding of larger molecules will produce a greater change in refractive index , detecting the binding of small - molecule li - gands is more challenging than for larger ones . Many membrane protein ligands of interest , especially in drug discovery , are small mole - cules with molecular weights of less than 1000 Da . The detection of small - molecule ligands by SPR to membrane proteins is made easier by having a high protein density on the sensor surface , but care has to be taken that the protein is still active since a high density of denatured protein is not very useful . When using the SPR experiment to screen a number of ligands binding to a membrane protein attached to a sensor surface , either directly or by competition with another ligand , it is im - portant to have appropriate washing steps that regenerate the sensor surface to its original condition and protein activity before introduction of the next ligand . It is also important that the activity and stability of the protein is retained for the duration of an experiment that screens for the binding of a number of ligands using the same sensor surface . This canbe keptincheckbyperformingappropriate activityandcontrol measurements throughout theexperiment , including atthe end . Condi - tionswherethereisminimaltime - dependentlossofproteinactivityare obviouslydesirable . These are further challenges thathave tobeconsid - ered , someof whichhavebeen overcomeasdescribed alongwith appli - cation to speci ﬁ c membrane protein systems in the following section of this review . 4 . Applications with membrane protein systems 4 . 1 . GPCRs The abundance and importance of GPCRs and their roles as drug targets has been described in other contributions to this Special Issue . SPR methods have been developed and used to characterise li - gand binding with a number of GPCR systems , which are described in this section . 4 . 1 . 1 . Rhodopsin Some of the earliest works that used SPR to detect and character - ise binding to a GPCR , indeed to any membrane protein , were performed on the light - activated receptor rhodopsin . Salamon et al . incorporated bovine rhodopsin into an egg phosphatidylcholine bi - layer deposited on a thin metal ﬁ lm , in this case silver , and demon - strated the tight binding and activation of its associated G - protein ( transducin ) from the SPR data [ 43 ] . It was possible to monitor and quantify the saturable binding of transducin to the receptor and then follow effects from a light - induced conformational change and then binding of GTP on its addition to the aqueous phase . A few years later , spatially and time - resolved SPR measurements and thenamicropatternedimmobilisationtechniqueweredeveloped [ 44 , 45 ] to enable G protein activation , ligand binding , and receptor deactivation withbovinerhodopsintobefollowedbySPR ( Fig . 2 ) . Thekeytothelatter approach was use of microcontact printing to produce micrometer - sized patterns that had high contrast in receptor activity compared with the background and therefore enhanced sensitivity . Rhodopsin was immobilised on the sensor surface by exploiting a glycosylation site at the extracellular N - terminus that is conserved among GPCRs and use of carbohydrate - speci ﬁ c chemistry for biotinylation ( Fig . 2 ) . Streptavidin was bound to biotinylated - thiols in a mixed self - assembled monolayer ( SAM ) with an excess of ω - hydroxy - undecanethiol ( HTA ) on the metal surface , which then bound the biotinylated receptor to the surface through its extracellular N - terminus in a de ﬁ ned orientation ( Fig . 2 ) . Fol - lowing immobilisation of the receptor and thorough washing with 46 S . G . Patching / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838 ( 2014 ) 43 – 55 detergent ( 48 mM ) , a supported lipid bilayer ( SLB ) [ 46 ] was formed around the receptors by use of a detergent micellar dilution method [ 47 ] . This involved treatment with an aqueous solution of 0 . 1 M KCl containing 50 mM the detergent octyl glucoside and 4 mM of phospha - tidylcholine lipid . Formation of the lipid layer was achieved by stepwise dilution of the detergent in the analyte ﬂ ow to below its CMC value and until the SPR response was stable . Having this lipid layer supported on top of the preformed SAM provides a water layer between the two ; this is important for accommodating the proper folding of extramembrane parts of the reconstituted receptor . Micropatterns of SAMs on the metal surface with alternating stripes ( width 200 μ m ) of pure HTA ( back - ground reference ) and biotin - thiol / HTA ( receptor binding region ) were produced followed by the binding procedure described above . Activity of the immobilised receptor was observed in SPR data following its illu - minationwithlight , whichwasachievedbyuseofhome - builtSPRequip - ment where a glass window at the opposite side of the cuvette allowed for ﬂ ash illumination of the surface ( see reference [ 44 ] for a diagram of the optical con ﬁ guration ) . Illumination induced activity of the G protein was followed by its desorption from the membrane ( Fig . 2A , ( ii ) and ( iii ) ) ; this activity was twenty ﬁ ve times lower in the reference region of the micropattern . Following activation , the SPR data could also then follow cleavage of the Schiff ' s base between rhodopsin and its chromo - phore all - trans - retinal and relaxation of the G protein to its starting posi - tion ( Fig . 2A , ( iv ) and ( v ) ) . Ligand binding was monitored and quanti ﬁ ed fromtheSPRdatabyadding11 - cis - retinalinincreasingconcentrationsto the immobilised and completely photolysed receptor ( opsin ) , which gave a dissociation constant of 130 nM . In further experiments using rhodopsin as a model protein , Karlsson and Löfås developed a rapid ﬂ ow - mediated on - surface immobilisation and reconstitution method for SPR measurements with membrane pro - teins [ 48 ] . This used a carboxylated dextran surface modi ﬁ ed with long alkyl groups ( L1 chip ) to which detergent - solubilised puri ﬁ ed receptor wasimmobilised by amine - coupling . The surfacewas immedi - ately washed with lipid / detergent ( POPC / octylglucoside ) mixed mi - celles then the detergent was eluted in the subsequent buffer ﬂ ow and the remaining lipid formed a bilayer on the sensor surface , which reconstituted the receptor . Activity of the reconstituted receptor was demonstrated by monitoring the rhodopsin - mediated dissociation of transducin . Since the reconstitution procedure could be achieved in ap - proximately 1 minute and the deposited lipids could be completely re - moved by two consecutive injections of detergent , this method offered potential for medium - throughput measurements with membrane pro - teins that are stable to the procedure . 4 . 1 . 2 . Chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 SPR has been used to characterise ligand binding to the human chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 . These receptors have also been used to demonstrate important developments in SPR methods for puri ﬁ cation , solubilisation , reconstitution and functional analysis of GPCRs .

A supported lipid bilayer is then formed around the immobilised receptor , which binds the G - protein . ( ii ) Light - induced photoisomerisation of receptor - bound 11 - cis to all - trans - retinal triggers the active conformation of rhodopsin , which binds the G - protein releasing its GDP . ( iii ) The G - protein desorbs from the receptor upon GTP binding . ( iv ) The activated receptor decays spontaneously to all - trans - retinal and opsin and the G - protein binds again to the membrane surface following hydrolysis of GTP . ( v ) cis - retinal binds to opsin , which regenerates photoactivatable rhodopsin . B .

Patching / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838 ( 2014 ) 43 – 55 β - arrestin 1 binding to CCR5 , which was shown to be at a conserved Asp - Arg - Tyr motif within the second intracellular loop [ 49 ] . This work used C - terminal derived peptides and a cytoplasmic loop of CCR5 immobilised on a CM5 sensor chip through the thiol group of an N - terminal cysteine residue or on a Sa5 streptavidin sensor chip through an N - terminal biotin moiety , repectively . β - Arrestin 1 was included in the analyte ﬂ ow for analysis of its binding from the SPR response . Using CCR5 and CXCR4 as model systems , Stenlund et al . [ 50 ] devel - opedamethodforthecaptureandreconstitutionofGPCRsontoasensor surface from crude cell preparations without the need for their prior pu - ri ﬁ cation ( Fig . 3A ) . The ‘ captureand reconstitution ’ method ﬁ rstinvolves immobilisation of acapturing molecule that recognises the GPCR at asite distinct from the ligand binding site , in this case 1D4 monoclonal antibodies were immobilised through aldehyde coupling chemistry to a hydrazide - modi ﬁ ed L1 sensor chip . Detergent - solubilised receptors from crude cell lysates are then captured by the antibody molecules on to the sensor surface . Washing with lipid / detergent mixed micelles , in this case made of POPC / CHAPSO , reconstitutes the receptors in a lipid bi - layer from which detergent is removed by washing with buffer ( Fig . 3B ) [ 50 ] . The captured and reconstituted receptors can then be tested for ac - tivityandforthebindingofligands . BothCCR5andCXCR4werecaptured in this way then the structural and functional integrity of CXCR4 was tested by the binding of a conformationally - dependent antibody and a native chemokine ligand stromal cell - derived factor 1 α ( SDF - 1 α ) ( Fig . 3C and D ) [ 50 ] . Having the receptor molecule attached to the anti - body at a known site that is distinct from the ligand binding site helps to orient the receptor so that the ligand binding site is facing towards the analyte ﬂ ow rather than towards the sensor surface and should also create a more homogenous surface . Interestingly , binding of SDF - 1 α to CXCR4 captured and reconstituted on an L1 chip , captured on an L1 chip without lipids and captured on a CM5 chip gave similar A ( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) ( v ) ( vi ) B Time ( sec ) R es pon se ( RU ) C N o r m a li se d r es pon se D N o r m a li se d r es p on se CXCR4 + SDF - 1 Time ( sec ) Time ( sec ) E R es pon se ( RU ) F Time ( sec ) Time ( sec ) Time ( sec ) Control CXCR4 CCR5 Fig . 3 . Capture and reconstitution of GPCRs on a biosensor surface : Binding of conformation - dependent antibodies and small - molecule ligands to the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 . A . Schematic illustration for the capture and reconstitution of GPCRs on a sensor surface . ( i ) A capturing molecule that recognises the GPCR at a position distant from the ligand binding site , in this case 1D4 monoclonal antibody , is immobilised on an L1 sensor chip that has a dextran surface containing hydrophobic alkane groups . ( ii ) A detergent - solubilised GPCR is captured by the immobilised antibody . ( iii ) The captured GPCR is reconstituted in a lipid bilayer by injecting lipid / detergent - mixed micelles in the analyte ﬂ ow . ( iv ) The surface is washed with buffer to remove detergent molecules , leaving behind a lipid bilayer . ( v ) The functional activity of the lipid - reconstituted GPCR is test - ed by binding of conformation - dependent antibodies . ( vi ) Binding of small - molecule ligands by the capturedand reconstituted GPCR can then be tested . B .

F . Schematic illustration of the capture and reconstitution method for measuring the binding of conformation - dependent antibodies and small - molecule ligands to chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 . ( Pictures A – D are modi ﬁ ed from Stenlund et al . [ 50 ] , E is modi ﬁ ed from Navratilova et al . [ 51 ] and F is reproduced from Navratilova et al . [ 52 ] ) . 48 S . G . Patching / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838 ( 2014 ) 43 – 55 dissociation equilibrium constants ( K D ) of 160 ± 3 , 156 ± 2 and 180 ± 4 nM , respectively , which were also similar to a value of ~ 200 nM deter - mined from a cell - based assay . This demonstrates that a membrane pro - tein may not have to be in a membrane or lipid environment to retain its ligand binding activity , solubilsation in detergent may be suf ﬁ cient ; this has to be tested on a case by case basis with each membrane protein under investigation . The same group made a number of further develop - mentstothemethod andsuccessfullydemonstrated its useforscreening small - molecule binding . An automated BIAcore ™ - based assay was de - veloped for screening receptor solubilisation conditions to improve re - ceptor activity and stability , which was demonstrated with CCR5 and CXCR4 [ 51 ] . This work also demonstrated that CCR5 was functional with respect to binding the HIV - 1 viral surface protein gp120 , which was inhibited by the small molecule TAK - 779 ( Fig . 3E ) [ 51 ] . The system was then used to screen for further small molecule binding ( Fig . 3F ) [ 52 ] , as follows . CCR5 and CXCR4 were captured by 1D4 immobilised on a CM4 sensor chip using amine - coupling chemistry and their activi - ties were demonstrated by binding of the native chemokine ligands RANTES and SDF - 1 α , respectively . Nineteen small - molecule inhibitors ( average MW 550 Da ) at a range of concentrations were tested for bind - ing toCCR5 using freshly prepared sensor surfaces . The resultant binding af ﬁ nities ( K D values ) from the SPR measurements showed good correla - tion with inhibition constants ( K i values ) obtained from a whole - cell based assay that tested binding of the same compounds [ 52 ] . This work therefore demonstrated the potential for using SPR to screen small - molecule libraries of compounds for their binding to GPCRs . In the same year , Silin et al . reported an alternative method for capturing GPCRs on a sensor surface using CCR5 as a model [ 53 ] . This involved selective immobilisation of receptor - containing mem - brane vesicles on a sensor surface that was constructed from sequen - tial treatments of biotin in a protein - resistant matrix with ( strept ) avidin , a biotinylated antibody , and a receptor - speci ﬁ c antibody . TheautomatedBIAcore ™ technologywasalsousedtodevelopanaf - ﬁ nity puri ﬁ cation method and a screen for co - crystallisation conditions with CCR5 [ 54 ] . This work included characterisation of nine HIV - 1 gp120 variants andidenti ﬁ edatruncated constructthatbound CCR5 in - dependent of CD4 , which was then used in an af ﬁ nity puri ﬁ cation step to improve activity of the detergent - solubilised receptor by approxi - mately 300 % [ 54 ] . Automated systems for detergent screening of GPCRs were also developed using CCR5 [ 55 ] . The developed SPR methods with CCR5 have been used to measure the real - time binding of gp120 and to identify antagonists that bind to the receptor and stabi - lise a conformation that is unable to bind the HIV - 1 gp120 – CD4 com - plex [ 56 ] and to screen for the binding of novel orthosteric and allosteric ligands [ 57 ] . In recent work that demonstrated CCR5 to be a receptor for Staphylococcus aureus leukotoxin ED [ 58 ] , SPR was used to show a direct interaction between the LukE subunit and CCR5 in whichbindingwastime - dependentandsaturablewithanapparentdis - sociationconstant ( K D ) of 39 . 6 ± 0 . 4 nM . Aninabilityof LukEto bind to CXCR4 con ﬁ rmed the binding to CCR5 to be speci ﬁ c . 4 . 1 . 3 . Neurotensin receptor - 1 A novel receptor - analyte con ﬁ guration was used to characterise neurotensin receptor - 1 binding to the neurotransmitter peptide neurotensin using SPR [ 59 , 60 ] . Neurotensin biotinylated at the N - terminus was immobilised on a streptavidin - coated sensor chip and puri ﬁ ed detergent - solubilised receptor was included in the analyte ﬂ ow for analysis of the receptor - ligand interaction . The reasoning be - hind this arrangement was that binding of the larger receptor molecule to the immobilised ligand would produce a greater mass change on bindingand therefore a larger SPR response . An N - terminal biotinylated ‘ scrambled ’ peptide with the same residues as neurotensin was used to create a control sensor surface for receptor binding . A speci ﬁ c concentration - dependent ligand - receptor interaction was demonstrat - ed from the SPR data , which yielded an apparent K D value of 1 – 2 nM similar to values measured using a radioligand - binding assay . 4 . 1 . 4 . Human olfactory receptor 17 - 4 SPR has been used to demonstrate the ligand binding activity of a human olfactory receptor produced by cell - free synthesis [ 61 ] . Human olfactory receptor 17 - 4 ( hOR17 - 4 ) was captured by a mono - clonal anti - polyhistidine antibody immobilised on a CM4 sensor chip using amine - coupling chemistry . The odorant undecanal was injected at a range of concentrations and the resultant SPR response was used to derive a binding af ﬁ nity of ~ 22 μ M , which was in agree - ment with measurements obtained from other in vitro techniques . 4 . 1 . 5 . Neuropeptide Y4 receptor N - terminal domain As part of structural and functional studies of the 41 - residue N - terminus of the neuropeptide Y4 receptor ( N - Y4 ) , SPR was used to investigate possible interactions with peptides from the neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) family [ 62 ] . N - terminal biotinylated neuropeptides were immobilised on a streptavidin - coated sensor chip and N - Y4 was injected in the analyte ﬂ ow at a range of concentrations . The SPR response gave a K D value of 50 μ M for binding of the natural ligand pancreatic polypep - tide ( PP ) , whilst binding of the hormones neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) and peptide YY ( PYY ) was too weak to measure an af ﬁ nity ( > 1 mM ) . 4 . 1 . 6 . Adenosine - A 2A receptor Using the adenosine A 2A receptor , a new approach called ‘ Biophys - ical Mapping ’ ( BPM ) [ 63 , 64 ] has been developed that combines a thermostabilised GPCR with SPR analysis of ligand binding to binding - site mutants to give matrices of data that can be used to pro - duce high quality three - dimensional pictures of ligand binding sites in the absence of a high - resolution crystal structure or can be com - bined with such a structure ( Fig . 4 ) . A stabilised form of the A 2A re - ceptor , ‘ StaR ’ was engineered by introducing a number of mutations , which included A54L , T88A , K122A and V239A following alanine - scanning mutagenesis . Further single - site mutations were introduced into this StaR background at eight positions ( L85A , L167A , M177A , N253A , Y271A , I66A , N181A , S277A ) predicted to be directly involved in ligand binding from a homology model based on the crystal struc - ture of the thermostabilised β 1 - adrenergic receptor and from the re - sults of radioligand binding with the antagonist [ 3 H ] ZM241385 . Each of the detergent - solubilised StaR mutants was immobilised on a Ni - loaded NTA sensor chip through their His - tag and tested for binding with a library of 21 small - molecule compounds that were injected separately in the analyte ﬂ ow at a range of concentrations ( 5 – 80 nM ) . The SPR responses ( Fig . 4B ) were used to create matrices of binding af ﬁ nities and kinetic information ( K D , k on , k off ) to compare the effects of each mutation on ligand binding speci ﬁ city ( Fig . 4C ) . Binding af ﬁ nities measured for each compound with the unaltered StaR background were very similar to those obtained from a compet - itive radioligand - binding assay . The structure - activity relationships observed in the SPR data were used to create biophysical maps and to optimise homology models of the A 2A receptor binding site with docked ligands ( Fig . 4D and E ) . A subsequent crystal structure of the A 2A receptor in complex with ZM241385 [ 65 ] allowed testing of the homology model with this ligand that was revised based on the BPM experiments . The binding pose of the ligand was very similar in the crystal structure and model except for a difference in the chi1 angle of Tyr271 . A later crystal structure solved for an A 2A StaR in complex with ZM241385 [ 66 ] had a more similar conformation for Tyr271 compared with the BPM - derived homology model , however . This work has demonstrated how SPR can be used to screen a li - brary of small - molecule ligands for binding to a real GPCR and how the resultant binding and kinetic data can be used to create a three - dimensional picture of the ligand - binding site . 4 . 1 . 7 . β 1 - Adrenergic receptor A biophysical fragment screening approach using SPR for the ini - tial screen has recently been applied to the thermostabilised turkey β 1 - adrenergic receptor ( β 1 AR ) [ 67 ] . Alongside the thermostabilised 49 S . G . Patching / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838 ( 2014 ) 43 – 55 A 2A receptor , thermostabilised β 1 AR StaR was screened for binding a subset of the Heptares fragment library ( ~ 650 fragments ) using SPR with the receptors immobilised on nickel - charged NTA sensor chips . Among the fragments that bound selectively to β 1 AR StaR were two arylpiperazine compounds with binding af ﬁ nities ( K D values ) of 16 and 5 . 6 μ M and good ligand ef ﬁ ciencies of 0 . 41 and 0 . 48 ( Fig . 5A ) . A fragment hit - to - lead exercise was then performed using a radioligand binding assay , which identi ﬁ ed a number of fragments that bound with even higher af ﬁ nity including an indole compound and a quino - line compound ( Fig . 5B ) . Crystal structures of thermostabilised β 1 AR in complex with these two compounds were solved at resolutions of 2 . 8 and 2 . 7 Å , respectively . The observed protein – ligand interactions in the crystal structures suggested that these compounds are antago - nists of β 1 AR . These results demonstrate a ﬁ rst full fragment - based drug discovery program applied to a GPCR with screening using SPR . 4 . 2 . Non - GPCRs In addition to GPCRs , SPR methods have been developed and used to characterise ligand binding with a range of other membrane pro - tein systems , which are described below . 4 . 2 . 1 . Outer membrane receptor FhuA SPR has been used to probe for conformational changes in the FhuA outer membrane receptor of E . coli , which transports iron - chelating siderophores into the cytoplasm , by observing the binding of monoclonal antibodies [ 68 ] . These measurements were performed with FhuA in its apo - and siderophore - bound states with ferricrocin and in the absence and presence of protein TonB , which is found in the cytoplasmic membrane and transduces energy to FhuA to facili - tate siderophore transport . Four monoclonal antibodies were pro - duced that mapped to epitopes on outer surface - exposed loops 3 , 4 and 5 and to β - barrel strand 14 . For measurements of antibody bind - ing to FhuA , the antibodies were immobilised separately on CM4 sen - sor chips using amine coupling chemistry and FhuA was injected in the analyte ﬂ ow . For measurements involving TonB , this protein was immobilised on the sensor chip using thiol coupling chemistry followed by injection of FhuA and then the antibodies .

Patching / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838 ( 2014 ) 43 – 55 used to measure the kinetics of all binding interactions , which re - vealed that binding of TonB to FhuA promotes conformational changes in outer surface - exposed loops 3 and 5 of FhuA . The data also suggested that the presence of ferricrocin alters the properties of the FhuA - TonB binding interaction and therefore in ﬂ uences the re - sultant conformational changes . 4 . 2 . 2 . Tyrosine kinase HER2 receptor subdomain Using the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 as a proof of principle , a medium - throughput ligand screening strategy has been developed using synthetic peptides that mimic a selected subdomain of the target protein [ 69 ] . In this case , a modi ﬁ ed fragment that mimics HER2 domain IV in its Herceptin - bounded conformation was designed and immobilised using a biotinylated N - terminus on a streptavidin - coated sensor chip . Injection of the antibody Herceptin in the analyte ﬂ ow at a range of concentrations produced SPR responses from which the mea - sured binding af ﬁ nity ( K D 19 . 2 nM ) and kinetic rate constants veri ﬁ ed the approach for SPR analysis of ligand binding . 4 . 2 . 3 . Human ( pro ) renin receptor SPR has been used to investigate binding of human ( pro ) renin re - ceptor to human renin with the receptor in three forms : full - length ( hPRR ) , lacking the cytoplasmic domain ( hPRR - Δ CD ) and just the ex - tracellular domain ( hPRR - Δ TM Δ CD ) [ 70 ] . Puri ﬁ ed human renin was immobilised on a sensor chip using amine coupling chemistry then the three puri ﬁ ed receptor forms injected in the analyte ﬂ ow at a range of concentrations . The SPR data showed binding af ﬁ nities for full - length hPRR and hPRR - Δ CD of 46 and 330 nM , respectively , suggesting that the cytoplasmic domain of hPRR is not essential for the binding of renin . The hPRR - Δ TM Δ CD form showed no binding af - ﬁ nity , therefore demonstrating that the puri ﬁ ed hPRR extracellular domain does not have the ability to bind with human renin . Extracel - lular domain obtained from the microsomal fraction ( non - puri ﬁ ed ) did retain full renin binding activity compared with full - length hPRR , however . 4 . 2 . 4 . α - Hemolysin Using α - hemolysin and binding of its speci ﬁ c antibody as a model system , a novel SPR approach using arrays of periodic nanopores in a free - standing metal ﬁ lm and pore - spanning lipid membranes has been developed for kinetic binding assays [ 71 ] ( Fig . 6 ) . This differs from conventional SPR since it is based on the phenomenon of an ex - traordinary optical transmission ( EOT ) effect [ 72 ] through periodic nanopore arrays in metallic ﬁ lms ( Fig . 6A ) , in this case using an Au / Si 3 N 4 ﬁ lm . The patterned nanopores in the metal ﬁ lm are encapsulat - ed in a silica layer then a pore - spanning lipid membrane is formed over the surface by vesicle rupture . Since part of the lipid membrane is suspended over the nanopores it is accessible from both sides and therefore better resembles a natural lipid membrane . A target protein can be reconstituted into the lipid membrane and the binding of li - gands changes the local refractive index and the EOT effect through the nanopores . In the transmission spectra , the resonance wavelength red - shifted on forming the lipid membrane from phosphatidylcholine vesicles and then shifted further on incorporation of heptameric α - hemolysin into the lipid membrane and then further again on binding biotinylated anti - α - hemolysin antibody ( Fig . 6B ) . Real - time kinetic measurements were made to follow these events and then to monitor the binding of a range in concentrations of the antibody ( Fig . 6C ) and the response used to measure a binding af ﬁ nity ( K D ) of 19 ± 10 nM . Binding of streptavidin - R - phycoerythrin to the anti - body further con ﬁ rmed the speci ﬁ c binding interaction of the anti - body with α - hemolysin . 4 . 2 . 5 . β - Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 An SPR ligand binding assay for full - length β - site amyloid precur - sor protein cleaving enzyme 1 ( BACE1 ) reconstituted in native brain lipid membranes has been developed [ 73 ] . This protein , which has a single transmembrane - spanning domain , is responsible for control - ling the formation of peptides that are constituents of amyloid plaques , so it is therefore a drug target for Alzheimer ' s disease . BACE1 was expressed in insect cells and captured directly from the cell lysate on to an L1 sensor chip surface immobilised using amine coupling chemistry with an antibody speci ﬁ c for a His 6 tag . The pro - tein was then reconstituted into a membrane formed from brain lipid extract and tested for the binding of six different known BACE1 inhibitors . This analysis was performed using two different pH values of 7 . 4 and 4 . 5 and in the presence of added calcium . Kinetic analysis of the SPR responses showed different binding characteristics for the different compounds and at the different pH values , the addi - tion of calcium had no signi ﬁ cant affects on these . 4 . 2 . 6 . Human CD4 receptor in nanodiscs Using the human CD4 receptor as a model system , a new SPR ap - proach with membrane proteins reconstituted in nanodiscs as the ana - lyte has been developed for ligand - binding studies [ 74 ] . Nanodiscs are discoidal model membrane systems that can encapsulate and solubilise integral membrane proteins in a near - native environment and have al - ready been used with a number of biophysical techniques . This work used a cysteine replacement variant of the transmembrane and cyto - plasmic domains ( residues 372 – 433 ) of human CD4 fused to ubiquitin with a His 10 tag at its N - terminus referred to as His - Ubi - CD4 . Nanodiscs containing this fusion protein were constructed using a membrane Fig . 6 . Detectionofantibodybindingto α - hemolysinusingaplasmonicnanoporearrayandpore - spanninglipidmembrane . A . Cartoonrepresentationofananoporearrayinametal ﬁ lm with a pore - spanning lipid membrane . The transmission of light through the nanopores is modulated by the presence of a lipid membrane formed by vesicle rupture and sub - sequent binding of molecules . The lipid membrane is suspended over the nanopores such that it can be accessed from both sides and therefore better mimics a natural cell mem - brane . B . Transmission spectra change before ( black line ) and after formation of a pore - spanning lipid membrane ( red line ) , after formation of a α - hemolysin pore on the lipid membrane ( green line ) and after binding of anti - α - hemolysin antibody ( blue line ) on a Au / Si 3 N 4 ﬁ lm with a periodic array of nanopores . C . Real - time kinetic measurements for anti - α - hemolysin antibody binding at a range of concentrations to α - hemolysin in a suspended lipid membrane on a nanopore array . ( Pictures A – C were reproduced from Im et al . [ 71 ] ) . 51 S . G . Patching / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1838 ( 2014 ) 43 – 55 scaffold protein ( MSP ) and POPC lipids with isolation and puri ﬁ cation by gel ﬁ ltration chromatography and solutions of these were used as the analyte in the SPR measurements . The resultant nanodiscs contained one His - Ubi - CD4 molecule per nanodisc . For binding to a PentaHis monoclonal antibody immobilised on a CM5 sensor chip through amine coupling , control analyte solutions contained His - Ubi ( not fused to CD4 ) or empty nanodiscs . Measurements with empty nanodiscs were subtracted from measurements with His - Ubi - CD4 - nanodiscs to correct for any background non - speci ﬁ c binding . Kinetic analysis of SPR data obtained using a range in analyte concentrations gave af ﬁ nities and rate constants in the expected range with K D values of 10 and 11 nM for binding His - Ubi and His - Ubi - CD4 - nanodiscs , re - spectively . This work demonstrated that it is feasible to use membrane proteins solubilised in nanodiscs as the analyte for SPR measurements of ligand binding . 4 . 2 . 7 . Human ABC transporter P - gp in nanodiscs SPRhas been usedto probetheconformation of humanATP - binding cassette transporter P - gp reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs and the bind - ing of inhibitory antibodies [ 75 ] . P - gp mediates the ef ﬂ ux of drugs that contributes to cancer cell drug resistance , so is a target for new therapeutics that modulates the effectiveness of such drugs . The anti - bodies MRK16 and UIC2 were immobilised separately on CM5 sensor chips using amine - coupling chemistry . Puri ﬁ ed P - gp reconstituted in MSP1D1 nanodiscs was injected in the analyte ﬂ ow in the absence and presence of the drug vinblastine and the non - hydrolysable nucleo - tide AMPPNP and withADP or ADP plusVO 4 . P - gp was shown to bind to both antibodies in the absence of drug and in the presence of AMPPNP or AMP . The af ﬁ nity and kinetics for binding of the P - gp nanodiscs to the antibodies were not affected by the presence of vinblastine . The results also suggested that drugs are not released from the ADP - VO 4 - trapped state . 4 . 2 . 8 . Epidermal growth factor receptor on intact cells A novel intact - cell - based SPR method for measurements of ligand binding has been developed and demonstrated with the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor [ 76 ] . The peptide ligand EGF was biotinylated using a polyethylene glycol spacer by coupling with its amine groups and then immobilised on a streptavidin - coated sensor chip . A suspension of human carcinoma A431 cells was injected in the analyte ﬂ ow and the resultant SPR responses were consistent with binding to the immobilised EGF . The speci ﬁ city of the interaction was con ﬁ rmed by competitive reduction of this response by the free EGF ligand added at a range of concentrations in the analyte ﬂ ow along with the cells . 4 . 2 . 9 . β 3 γ - aminobutyric acid type A receptors An SPR assay has been used to screen the binding of 51 histaminer - gic and 15 GABAergic ligands with full - length homo - oligomeric β 3 γ - aminobutyric acid type A ( GABA A ) receptors [ 77 ] ( Fig . 7 ) , which be - long to the superfamily of Cys - loop ligand - gated ion channels and are involved in a wide range of neurological functions . Though the homo - oligomeric forms of these receptors have not yet been identi ﬁ ed inthehumanbrain , theyserveasusefulmodelsystemsforinvestigating receptor function and pharmacology [ 77 ] . This work used rat homo - oligomeric β 3 GABA A receptors with a His 8 - tag that were expressed in insect cells , puri ﬁ ed from isolated membranes and solubilised in deter - gent . The receptors were captured by polyhistidine monoclonal anti - bodies that were immobilised on CM3 and CM5 sensor chip surfaces using amine coupling chemistry , a control ﬂ ow cell had a surface with immobilisedantibodieswithoutboundreceptors .

Equilibrium dissociation constants ( K D ) were determined by non - linear regression analysis of steady - state SPR signals as a function of ligand concentrationusingaLangmuir isothermequation . In addition to direct interaction binding of ligands with the receptors , competitive bindingwith histamine wasalso measured for a more rigorousanalysis . Of the 51 histaminergic ligands tested , 17 had a binding interaction with a K D value of less than 300 μ M ( Fig . 7 ) . Despite its small size , bind - ingof histaminecould be detected giving a K D value of 100 μ M , whichis inthesameorderofmagnitudeasvaluesobtainedfromelectrophysiolog - icalmeasurementsonhumanhomo - oligomericreceptors [ 77 ] . Histamine H1 receptor ligands did not interact with the β 3 receptors , binding of histamine H2 receptor agonists , except histamine , was not detected , whilst three histamine H2 receptor antagonists bound with a higher af - ﬁ nity than histamine ( tiotidine , burimamide and famotidine ) .

Some histamine H4 receptor ligands also bound to the receptors with a higher af ﬁ nity than histamine , including 4 - methylhistamine ( Fig . 7 ) . Of the 15 GABAergic ligands tested , ﬁ ve known active compounds showed a binding interaction with the β 3 receptors of higher af ﬁ nity than that of histamine , but still in the low micromolar range ( Fig . 7 ) , whilst the others showed no binding up to a concentration of 100 μ M . In the com - petition measurements , thirteen of the active histaminergic ligands com - peted with histamine whilst none of the GABAergic ligands showed a competitive effect . This work not only con ﬁ rmed that GABA A receptors havedistincthistaminergicpharmacologyinagreementwithpreviousre - sults , it also identi ﬁ ed new ligands of the β 3 receptor .

Recent developments and potential for drug discovery Next - generation SPR instruments use a sensor surface based on nano - structured materials [ 78 ] ( Figs . 6 and 8A ) . Unlike the BIAcore ™ technology , which uses a prism to focus the light , these instruments are based on the phenomenon of extraordinary optical transmission ( EOT ) [ 72 ] where light at speci ﬁ c wavelengths transmitted through nanoholes in thin metal ﬁ lms is of higher intensity than the incident light . This is a consequence of plasmon generation in the metal ﬁ lm . When a large number of nanopores are arranged in a periodic array in a metal ﬁ lm , their combined plasmon generation ‘ funnels ’ the light en - ergy across the ﬁ lm . When molecules bind to the metal surface the spe - ci ﬁ c wavelength of light for optimum transmission is shifted , so the surface can be used as a sensor . Due to the large number of nanopores that can be patterned in to the metal ﬁ lm , the sensing capability of this approach is much greater than can be achieved by a conventional SPR instrument . Furthermore , a lipid bilayer can be suspended above thenanoporesand contain amembraneprotein of interest . Since thebi - layer can be accessed from both sides of the pore , this now allows SPR analysis of ligand binding to membrane proteins in a more native or near - native environment . This type of approach was demonstrated with α - hemolysin bindingtoitsspeci ﬁ c antibodydescribedearlier [ 71 ] . An exciting new technique called surface plasmon resonance mi - croscopy ( SPRM ) has recently been demonstrated that enables mea - surement of binding kinetics of membrane proteins in single living cells and therefore in their true native membrane environment [ 79 , 80 ] ( Fig . 8B ) . The technique also allows the simultaneous mea - surement of optical and ﬂ uorescence imaging of the same sample . Cells are cultured on a gold - coated slide and SPRM imaging is performed using an inverted microscope . Binding of ligands to recep - tor proteins on the cell surface can be monitored by SPRM with milli - second temporal and micrometer spatial resolution . So far this technique has been used to measure the binding interaction between glycoproteins on the cell surface and lectin injected as analyte and the binding activity and spatial distribution of nicotinic acetylcholine A B Plasmon generation through nanopores Surface plasmon resonance microscopy ( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) Fig . 8 .

Furthermore , SPRM allows simultaneous measurement of binding kinetics from thousands of sample spots , thus providing a sig - ni ﬁ cant enhancement in sensitivity over conventional SPR . The important drug discovery method of fragment - based screening has successfully been combined with SPR for the medium - throughput screening of chemical libraries [ 81 – 87 ] . So far this has mostly been demonstrated with soluble non - membrane protein targets , but there is clearly high potential for combining fragment - based drug screening with the SPR technological advances already described and membrane protein targets , recently exempli ﬁ ed by results demonstrated with the β 1 - adrenergic receptor ( Section 4 . 1 . 7 ) . 6 . Conclusions This review has demonstrated that SPR is a rapidly developing tech - nique for the quantitative characterisation of real - time binding and ki - netics of membrane protein – ligand interactions that is label - free and uses relatively small quantities of materials . It can be used with a wide range of membrane protein systems including GPCRs , which are the major molecular targets for current validated drugs and for foresee - able drug discovery . Recent developments in SPR instrumentation , sensor chip design , sample preparation strategies and the increasing availability of cloned , stabilised and puri ﬁ ed eukaryotic membrane proteins shows high potential for medium - throughput screening of li - braries in the search for new small - molecule and monoclonal antibody drugs .
