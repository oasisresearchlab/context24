County - Level Association of Social Vulnerability with COVID - 19 Cases and Deaths in the USA J Gen Intern Med DOI : 10 . 1007 / s11606 - 020 - 05882 - 3 © Society of General Internal Medicine 2020 INTRODUCTION In past pandemics , vulnerable populations faced greater disease burden and decreased testing and treatment ac - cess . 1 As coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) spreads in the USA , concern is growing that even the early stages of this pandemic have disproportionately impact - ed vulnerable communities . 2 – 4 However , the relationship between social vulnerability and COVID - 19 diagnosis and mortality in rural and urban communities remains unknown . METHODS We performed a county - level , cross - sectional analysis using COVID - 19 case and death rates compiled by The New York Times from health agency reports as of April 19 , 2020 . We stratified counties into quartiles using the U . S . Centers for Disease Control ’ s Social Vulnerability Index ( SVI ) , a validated measure of com - munity resilience during natural disasters and disease outbreaks across four domains : socioeconomic status , household composition and disability , minority status and language , and housing and transportation . 5 We de - fined urbanicity using the U . S . Department of Agricul - ture Economic Research Service ’ s 2013 Urban Influence Codes . 6 We merged data sources using Federal Informa - tion Processing Standard ( FIPS ) codes , including counties with a linkable FIPS code and at least one COVID - 19 case . Our primary outcomes were positive tests per capita and COVID - 19 deaths per capita . We built population - weighted , quasi - Poisson regression models to compare outcomes between the first and fourth quartiles of counties by SVI and each SVI domain . In secondary analyses , we stratified counties by rural and urban clas - sification . We included state fixed effects to account for heterogeneity in policies and disease spread . We ana - lyzed data with R Statistical Software , version 3 . 6 . 3 , and considered P < 0 . 002 significant after the Bonferroni correction . This study was approved by Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board . RESULTS As of April 19 , there were 612 , 404 confirmed cases and 25 , 978 COVID - 19 deaths across the 2754 ( of 3143 total ) counties analyzed ( mean cases 102 . 2 per 100 , 000 [ SE 3 . 8 ] , deaths 4 . 0 per 100 , 000 [ 0 . 2 ] ) . Compared with those in the least vulnerable counties , people in the most vulnerable counties had 1 . 63 - fold greater risk of COVID - 19 diagnosis and 1 . 73 - fold greater risk of death ( Table 1 ) . When considering only the minority status and language domain , people in the most vulnerable counties had 4 . 94 - fold and 4 . 74 - fold greater risks of COVID - 19 diagnosis and death , respectively . Mapping case burden in the most and least vulnerable counties by minority status revealed regional trends of this differen - tial risk ( Fig . 1 ) . Similarly , people in the most vulner - able counties by socioeconomic status ( relative risks [ RR ] of 1 . 42 and 1 . 71 ) and housing and transportation ( RR 1 . 52 and 1 . 32 ) domains had greater risk of COVID - 19 diagnosis and death . Vulnerability by the household composition and disability domain was not associated with differential risk . These trends persisted among urban counties alone . Among rural counties alone , the most vulnerable counties by minority status and language had greater risk of COVID - 19 diagnosis ( RR 3 . 74 ) , while associations with overall SVI , socioeconom - ic status , and housing and transportation were no longer significant . DISCUSSION Greater social vulnerability is associated with increased risk of COVID - 19 detection and death . In urban and rural counties alike , this is driven by differences across the minority status and language domain , consistent with preliminary reports of increased COVID - 19 prevalence and mortality among minorities . 2 Factors such as pover - ty , unemployment ( socioeconomic status domain ) , crowded housing , and vehicle access ( housing and Rohan Khazanchi and Evan R .

In rural communities , the minority status and lan - guage domain persists as a driver of increased COVID - 19 cases . The disproportionate impact of COVID - 19 on minority and non - English - speaking com - munities in both urban and rural areas may reflect compounding effects of structural racism , increased bur - den of chronic disease risk factors , and health care access barriers . This cross - sectional , county - level study does not allow for causal , individual - level inferences . Analyses did not account for all county - level differences in testing rates or pandemic progression , although state fixed effects accounted for some geographic heterogeneity . As case reporting improves , analyzing more granular groupings of non - metropolitan counties may further elucidate rural trends . In light of planned federal guidelines for county - level COVID - 19 risk stratification and limited national demo - graphic data , 4 our findings reemphasize the need for standardized collection of sociodemographic characteris - tics . Targeted interventions addressing geographically variable social vulnerabilities may be necessary to im - prove inequitable outcomes of the COVID - 19 pandemic , and health disparities more broadly .
