To advance understanding of their pathogenesis and relatedness to other breast cancer subtypes , 28 MBCs were compared with common breast cancers using comparative genomic hybrid - ization , transcriptional profiling , and reverse - phase protein arrays and by sequencing for common breast cancer muta - tions . MBCs showed unique DNA copy number aberrations compared with common breast cancers . PIK3CA mutations were detected in 9 of 19 MBCs ( 47 . 4 % ) versus 80 of 232 hormone receptor – positive cancers ( 34 . 5 % ; P = 0 . 32 ) , 17 of 75 HER - 2 – positive samples ( 22 . 7 % ; P = 0 . 04 ) , 20 of 240 basal - like cancers ( 8 . 3 % ; P < 0 . 0001 ) , and 0 of 14 claudin - low tumors ( P = 0 . 004 ) . Of 7 phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase / AKT pathway phosphorylation sites , 6 were more highly phosphorylated in MBCs than in other breast tumor subtypes . The majority of MBCs displayed mRNA profiles different from those of the most common , including basal - like cancers . By transcriptional profiling , MBCs and the recently identified claudin - low breast cancer subset constitute related receptor - negative subgroups characterized by low expression of GATA3 - regulated genes and of genes responsible for cell - cell adhesion with enrichment for markers linked to stem cell function and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) . In contrast to other breast cancers , claudin - low tumors and most MBCs showed a significant similarity to a ‘‘tumorigenic’’ signature defined using CD44 + / CD24 (cid:1) breast tumor – initiating stem cell – like cells . MBCs and claudin - low tumors are thus enriched in EMT and stem cell – like features , and may arise from an earlier , more chemoresistant breast epithelial precursor than basal - like or luminal cancers . PIK3CA mutations , EMT , and stem cell - like characteristics likely contribute to the poor outcomes of MBC and suggest novel therapeutic targets . [ Cancer Res 2009 ; 69 ( 10 ) : 4116 – 24 ] Introduction Metaplastic breast cancers ( MBC ) are aggressive estrogen re - ceptor - a – negative , progesterone receptor - negative , HER - 2 – negative ( triple - negative ) tumors characterized by mesenchymal / sarcoma - toid and / or squamous metaplasia of malignant breast epithelium ( 1 – 7 ) . Because of limited understanding of their pathogenesis , MBCs are treated in the same fashion as basal - like or triple re - ceptor - negative ductal cancers . However , whereas neoadjuvant che - motherapy is associated with high pathologic complete response rates in basal - like carcinomas , MBCs are usually chemoresistant ( 2 ) . Transcriptional profiling has defined breast cancer subtypes ( 8 , 9 ) . The origin of luminal A and B tumors appears to be the mammary duct luminal epithelium with concomitant hormone receptor expression . Elevated HER - 2 expression defines a subgroup with a poor prognosis ; however , the responsiveness of this sub - group to trastuzumab improves outcomes ( 10 ) . In contrast , basal - like cancers likely represent multiple different subtypes arising from distinct precursor cells from those of other cancers . Some basal - like breast cancers likely arise from mammary myoepithelial cells . To date , basal - like cancers have not presented specific ther - apy targets . As MBCs are triple - negative , they are distinct from luminal and HER - 2 - amplified cancers . As they express some markers associated with basal - like cancers ( e . g . , epidermal growth factor receptor and cytokeratins 5 / 6 ) , MBCs are proposed to represent a form of basal - like breast cancer . However , distinct clinical features such as chemoresistance suggest that MBCs may represent a unique subtype ( 2 , 3 ) . We applied an integrated genomic - proteomic approach to determine mechanisms underlying metaplastic carcinogenesis and MBC chemoresistance along with the relatedness of MBCs to known breast cancer subtypes . Most MBCs showed a unique molecular profile and form a distinct subtype most closely related to a novel subset of receptor - negative breast cancers ( claudin - low ) characterized by loss of genes involved in cell - cell adhesion .

CAN - 08 - 3441 An enrichment for stem cell - like and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) markers in MBCs ( and claudin - low tumors ) along with frequent genomic aberrations that activate the phosphatidy - linositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / AKT pathway suggest reasons for MBC chemoresistance and that MBCs and claudin - low tumors may arise from more immature precursor cells than other breast cancers . Materials and Methods Human tumors . Twenty - eight frozen grade 3 MBCs with sarcomatoid ( 19 ) or squamous ( 9 ) metaplasia were obtained from the Breast Tumor Bank at The University of Texas M . D . Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) and from a collaborator in Valencia ( A . L . ) . The diagnosis was reconfirmed by pathologists at MDACC ( M . Z . G . and S . K . ; refs . 2 , 3 ) . Frozen tissue was used for DNA extraction ( 28 tumors ) and , where adequate frozen tumor tissue remained , for RNA and protein extraction ( 16 MDACC tumors ; ref . 11 ) . Three tumor cohorts were used for comparison with MBCs ( Supple - mentary Fig . S1 ) . The first cohort , used for comparison of mutation frequency ( 547 tumors ) and functional proteomic profiles ( 693 ) , was composed of 693 frozen primary breast tumors obtained under institutional review board - approved protocols from MDACC . These tumors were sub - divided into clinically defined subtypes as described previously ( Table 1 ; ref . 12 ) . A second cohort of 145 primary breast tumors was used for comparison with MBC gene copy number profiles herein ( 13 , 14 ) . A third cohort ( Line - berger Comprehensive Cancer Center ) of 184 breast tumors and 9 normal breast tissues was used for comparison with MBC transcriptional profiles ( 8 , 9 , 15 ) . There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients with tumors of different stages between the cohorts . Comparative genomic hybridization . Comparative genomic hybrid - ization profiles from the 28 MBCs were generated at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) - based GeneChip Human Mapping 50K Sty arrays ( Affymetrix ) and compared with BAC - comparative genomic hybridization profiles of primary breast tumors previously generated and processed ( J . F . ) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory using HumArray1 . 14 / HumArray2 . 0 ( 13 , 14 , 16 – 18 ) . MBC 50K data are available . 12 For comparison with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory tumors , the 28 MBC SNP chips were mapped to BAC resolution . This approach has been validated by comparing data derived using both platforms to analyze breast cancer cell lines ( data not shown ) . Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory tumors were remapped to the May04 freeze from University of California - Santa Cruz and regions around each BAC clone were defined as within a half distance to each neighboring clone or to the beginning or end of the chromosome if telomeric . A median expression value was then obtained for SNPs in each BAC region . Missing values were assigned if < 5 SNPs mapped to a particular region . Each array was recentered to have a median of 0 . The resulting values were segmented using circular binary segmentation ( CBS ) followed by a merge - level procedure to combine segmented levels across the genome . Each missing value was assigned the value of its corresponding segment . Gain / loss events and fraction of genome altered were calculated . After this resolution reduction ( median , 18 SNPs / BAC ; mean , 30 ) , the mean variability estimate was 0 . 25 . Similar analyses beginning with the CBS steps were done on the original dChip processed data . We used a Fisher’s test to measure the difference in copy number at probes on each side of genes encoding PI3K / AKT pathway components . These P values were used to fit a h - uniform mixture model to determine significance at a given false discovery rate . To directly compare the 50K SNP and older BAC platforms , DNA ex - tracted from five MBCs was also run using the BAC platform . This con - firmed a high concordance for the matched data derived from the two platforms ( data not shown ) . Detection of mutations . DNA was extracted from 547 MDACC breast tumors along with 14 Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center claudin - low breast tumors and 19 MBCs with sufficient remaining DNA for mutation detection ( 9 , 11 , 12 ) . Following whole - genome amplification , p53 / PTEN genes were resequenced ( 19 ) . CTNNB1 exon 3 ( the most common site of mutations ) was amplified from genomic DNA using a forward primer located at the 5 ¶ portion and a reverse primer at the 3 ¶ end of the exon . A tumor sample with a known CTNNB1 mutation was amplified and sequenced in parallel with tumor samples as a positive control . A SNP - based approach ( Sequenom MassArray ) was used to detect mutations in PIK3CA , KRAS , and E17K mutations in the AKT1 / 2 / 3 genes ( 12 , 20 ) . This approach is unsuitable for detection of mutations that are not ‘‘hotspot’’ mutations but is particularly suitable to mutation detection in breast cancer where stromal ‘‘contamination’’ is prevalent ( 21 ) . Reverse - phase protein array . Reverse - phase protein array was applied with the antibodies in Supplementary Table S1 to compare PI3K / AKT and mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway activation in protein lysates derived from 16 MBCs versus 693 common breast cancers ( Supplementary Table S2 ; refs . 22 – 25 ) . The expression of each antibody in a sample was corrected for protein loading using the average expression levels of all probed proteins . Antibodies were obtained from SDI ( YB1 ) , Epitomics , Inc . ( p70S6K , PR ) , Lab Vision Corporation ( ER a ) , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( CCNDI , CCNEI , EGFR , GSK3 , p27 ) , Upstate Biotechnology ( Src ) and Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . Transcriptional profiling . Total RNA was isolated by phenol - chloro - form extraction ( Trizol , Life Technologies ) , and mRNA was purified by either magnetic separation using Dynabeads ( Dynal ) or the Invitrogen FastTrack 2 . 0 Kit . Twelve of 16 MBC RNA samples with RNA integrity numbers > 6 were assayed on Agilent oligomicroarrays at Lineberger Com - prehensive Cancer Center and compared with a published Agilent micro - array data set also previously assayed and processed ( C . M . P . ) at Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center ( 8 , 9 , 15 ) . The microarray and clinical data are available at University of North Carolina Microarray Database and in the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GSE10885 ) . Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer was applied to perform functional analysis of gene lists . Mapping gene expression onto regions of MBC copy number change . Using a Significance Analysis of Microarray ( SAM ) - defined list of MBC - defining genes , we determined the chromosomal location of each gene to link with the comparative genomic hybridization data . Probes with an undefined chromosomal position were discarded from further analyses . CBS was applied to the preprocessed MBC copy number data to determine breakpoints for aberrations ( 26 ) . The CBS calls made were as follows : class . segment < - segment ( class . cna , a = 0 . 05 , p . method = ‘‘perm , ’’ nperm = 1 , 000 , trim = 0 . 05 , undo . splits = ‘‘sdundo , ’’ undo . SD = 2 , verbose = 2 ) . Using CBS output , a plot of segment intensities versus segment markers was used to determine an intensity boundary threshold of 0 . 12 . Segments with intensity values beyond this threshold were flagged as gained or lost based on the sign of intensity and parsed from the original CBS output . By applying a customized R script to this output , segments from each sample were collated and regions were assigned that had varying levels of overlap between the MBC patients . Cutoffs were made for regions with aberrations in z 1 of 3 of MBCs tested . SAM genes with chromosomal locations that were contained within these gains and losses were determined and plotted . Comparison of the MBC and claudin - low transcriptional profiles with a CD44 + / CD24 (cid:1) / low breast cancer cell profile . We compared breast tumor transcriptional signatures with a‘‘tumorigenic’’signature 13 that was derived by comparing gene expression profiles of flow - sorted CD44 + / CD24 (cid:1) / low cancer cells with profiles of all other sorted cells ( CD44 (cid:1) / CD24 + and CD44 (cid:1) / CD24 (cid:1) combined ) . For each tumor , a ‘‘R value’’ was derived in relation to the ‘‘tumorigenic’’ signature , which was defined as the Pearson’s correlation between the ‘‘tumorigenic’’gene signature pattern ( using ‘‘1’’and 12 ftp : / / beamish . lbl . gov / njwang / 13 Creighton et al . , submitted for publication .

Tumors with high R values would tend to have both high expression of many of the genes high in ‘‘tumorigenic’’ cells and low expression of many of the genes low in ‘‘tumorigenic’’ cells ( and vice versa for tumors with low R values ) . Statistical analysis . R 14 and NCSS / PASS software were used . Reported P values are two sided . ANOVA and t tests for gene expression data were done using SAS . For clustering , we used CLUSTER and TREEVIEW ( University of Glasgow ) softwares . Results MBCs possess patterns of DNA copy number gains and losses that are distinct from those in common breast cancers . MBCs showed a high level of genomic instability based on fraction of the genome altered and number of transitions . However , MBCs showed a unique set of aberrations compared with common breast cancers ( Fig . 1 ; refs . 13 , 14 ) . Specifically , gains of distal chromosome 1p / 5p and loss of 3q were common in MBCs but rare in other breast cancers ( 13 , 14 ) . Conversely , alterations that occur in most breast cancers , such as gain of chromosome 1q and loss of 16q , were uncommon in MBC ( 13 , 14 ) . In particular , compared with basal - like tumors , MBCs exhibited more frequent amplification of 1p / 11q / 12q / 14q / 19p / 19q / 22q and increased frequency of loss at 1q / 2p / 3q / 8q . There was retention of 5q / 9q / 15q / 16p / 17p / 17q / 19p / 19q / 20q / 22q compared with basal - like tumors . Overall , MBCs did not display similar alterations to basal - like cancers and showed substantial differences from common breast cancers , compatible with MBCs representing a distinct subgroup . MBCs possess distinct patterns of somatic mutations from basal - like breast cancers . PIK3CA mutations were detected in 9 of 19 ( 47 . 4 % ) MBCs compared with 80 of 232 ( 34 . 5 % ) hor - mone receptor - positive cancers ( P = 0 . 32 ) , 17 of 75 ( 22 . 7 % ) HER - 2 - amplified samples ( P = 0 . 04 ) , 20 of 240 ( 8 . 3 % ) triple - negative cancers ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , and 0 of 14 claudin - low tumors ( P = 0 . 004 ; Table 1 ; ref . 12 ) . The PIK3CA mutation frequencies in the common subtypes are compatible with those frequencies reported in the literature , with the exception of that in claudin - low tumors , which has not been reported ( 27 ) . One PTEN mutation was detected in a MBC ( 5 % ) that did not have a PIK3CA mutation . p53 mutations were detected in 6 of 19 ( 32 % ) MBCs . No mutation in exon 3 of CTNNB1 was detected in 19 MBCs . Strikingly , therefore , 10 of 19 ( 53 % ) MBCs showed PI3K / AKT pathway mutations . This was significantly different from the muta - tion rate in triple - negative / basal - like cancers in particular . Fur - ther , other PI3K / AKT pathway genomic aberrations were more frequent in MBCs . Based on two SNP probes closest to each end of genes encoding PI3K / AKT components , AKT1 ( chromosome 14 ) , AKT2 ( chromosome 19 ) , and RPS6KB2 ( p70S6K , chromosome 11 ) showed more frequent copy number gain ( Fisher’s exact test , P < 0 . 05 at a 1 % false discovery rate ) in MBCs compared with other subtypes . This was also supported at the protein level using reverse - phase protein array data ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Thus , PI3K / AKT pathway aberrations likely play a major role in MBC pathophysiol - ogy , further suggesting that MBCs and basal - like tumors are distinct . PI3K pathway activation in MBC . The high frequency of genomic aberrations in PI3K / AKT pathway genes implicates this pathway in MBC pathogenesis . This pathway has already been implicated in breast cancer resistance to multiple therapies ( 28 – 30 ) . Using reverse - phase protein array , phosphorylation of most core PI3K / AKTpathway proteins was elevated in MBCs comparedwith at least one other breast tumor subtype ( Fig . 2 ) , with the exception of phosphorylated p70S6K . The most likely explanation for the latter discrepancy is phosphorylation of p70S6K by kinases other than core PI3K / AKT pathway kinases ( 31 , 32 ) . Overall , however , key PI3K / AKT pathway components are generally more highly phosphorylated in MBCs than in most other breast tumors , which parallels the results of the genomic analyses and could contribute to the poor outcomes associated with MBC ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Only glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation was higher in MBCs possessing mutant versus wild - type PIK3CA / PTEN genes ( P = 0 . 01 ) . The failure to show an association between PI3K / AKT pathway mutations and activation is potentially due to the small number of tumors analyzed . However , alterations in PI3K / AKT pathway activation by processes independent of mutations , by other interacting pathways , or by signaling modulation through feedback loops may have prevented identification of statistically significant associations ( 33 ) . Compatible with the latter contention , we have shown previously that PIK3CA mutational status is not correlated with AKT phosphorylation in hormone receptor - positive breast cancers or cell lines ( 12 ) . We also quantified expression and phosphorylation of several PI3K / AKT pathway - activating and pathway - related proteins Table 1 .

CAN - 08 - 3441 ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Epidermal growth factor receptor expression was lower in MBCs compared with other breast cancer subtypes . HER - 2 levels were also significantly decreased in MBCs relative to hormone receptor - positive , triple - negative , and , in particular , HER - 2 – positive tumors . Cyclin E1 , a PI3K / AKT pathway target , was present at higher levels in MBCs compared with hormone receptor - positive and HER - 2 – positive tumors ( P = 0 . 0005 and 0 . 02 , respectively ; refs . 34 , 35 ) . The Y box – binding protein 1 ( YB1 ) has been implicated in chemoresistance and is located in the chromosome 1p amplicon in MBC ( Fig . 1 ; ref . 36 ) . Indeed , YB1 was more frequently amplified ( at 1 % false discovery rate ) in MBCs than in other tumors , and YB1 protein expression was also higher in MBCs . MBC transcriptional profiles are distinct from those of basal - like breast cancers and related to those of claudin - low breast tumors . On unsupervised hierarchical clustering , the majority of MBCs displayed markedly different mRNA profiles from those of most common breast cancers including basal - like cancers ( data not shown ) . To explore the relationships between MBCs and the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes , 12 MDACC MBCs were compared with 184 breast tumors and 9 normal breast samples by hierarchical clustering using a combination of four Figure 1 . Gene copy number changes . Gains and losses in all common breast cancers ( including luminal , HER - 2 – amplified , and basal - like cancers ) and basal - like cancers alone versus metaplastic breast tumors were determined .

CAN - 08 - 3441 intrinsic gene lists ( 8 , 9 , 15 , 37 ) . MBCs were somewhat heterogeneous in this analysis ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Two MBCs clustered with basal - like tumors , two with a novel subtype of receptor - negative tumors that is characterized by loss of a cluster of genes that encode proteins involved in cell - cell adhesion ( claudin - low tumors ) , two clustered within the normal - like group , and six formed a novel subgroup with characteristics intermediate between those of basal - like and claudin - low tumors ( Supplemen - tary Fig . S3 ) . To assess the significance of this clustering pattern , we applied ‘‘SigClust’’ to test the null hypothesis that any group of samples contained within a common dendrogram branch constitutes a single group ( 38 ) . This analysis showed that the dendrogram branch containing six MBCs , along with some previously assayed tumors , represents a distinct group . On reanalysis of the histology of the latter tumors , four showed metaplastic and / or spindloid features compatible with the tumors representing MBCs ( Supple - mentary Fig . S4 ) . Further , mouse mammary tumors that are similar to human claudin - low tumors show a spindloid morphology ( 9 ) . The gene set that defines claudin - low and MBC tumors ( Supplementary Fig . S3 C ) was determined by Gene Ontology analysis to be enriched for the terms tight junction , intercellular junction , apicolateral plasma membrane , and cell junction . Of 29 claudin - low cluster genes , 13 are positively regulated by GATA3 and none by estrogen receptor - a ( hypergeometic mean analysis , P < 0 . 01 ; ref . 39 ) . In addition to lacking genes involved in cell - cell adhesion and polarity , MBCs and claudin - low tumors lack luminal genes including GATA3 ( Supplementary Fig . S3 F ) and HER - 2 and show inconsistent expression of genes associated with basal - like tumors ( Supplementary Fig . S3 D ) . t tests confirmed that the expression of the claudin - low cluster of genes ( Supplementary Fig . S3 C ) was lower in MBCs versus other breast cancers ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . MBCs and claudin - low tumors express high levels of stem cell and EMT markers . SAM was used to identify a MBC versus common breast tumor expression signature ( 40 , 41 ) . This analyses resulted in 556 up and 373 down genes , with a false discovery rate of < 1 gene ( Supplementary Table S4 ) . Almost 33 % of the ‘‘SAM up’’ and 50 % of the SAM down genes mapped to regions of copy number aberration ( see below ) .

CAN - 08 - 3441 cell adhesion , signal transduction , cellular process , cell - cell adhesion , and intracellular protein transport , whereas protein transport , intracellular transport , transport , male meiosis , and ubiquitin - dependent protein catabolism were enriched in the ‘‘down’’ gene list ( 40 ) . The claudin - low gene cluster showed a statistically significant overlap with the SAM - defined ‘‘down’’ genes ( 15 of 29 genes ; hypergeometic mean analysis , P < 0 . 001 ) . Genes near the top of the MBC ‘‘up’’ list that have been previously implicated in carcinogenesis included ALK , crystallin g , and the master regulator of EMT , TWIST1 ( 42 – 45 ) . Breast cancers are thought to contain a minority population of tumor initiating / stem cell - like cells with high CD44 but low or undetectable levels of CD24 ( CD44 + / CD24 (cid:1) ) ; these cells have higher ‘‘tumorigenic’’ capacity than other purified populations of tumor - derived cells ( 46 ) . Their phenotype and the low responsive - ness of MBCs to chemotherapy suggest that MBCs might possess stem cell - like characteristics . Indeed , MBCs had markedly elevated CD44 / CD24 and CD29 / CD24 ratios compared with other breast cancers , with the exception of claudin - low tumors ( Fig . 3 ) . This ‘‘electronic stem cell signature’’ is also differentially expressed between fluorescence - activated cell - sorted human breast tumor - initiating cells and normal breast epithelial cells ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ; refs . 46 , 47 ) . EMT is characterized by the up - regulation of vimentin and of E - cadherin repressor molecules ( snail / slug / twist ) with down - regula - tion of E - cadherin and other cell adhesion molecules ( 45 , 48 , 49 ) . These events occur in MBCs and claudin - low tumors ( Fig . 3 ; Supplementary Table S3 ) . In MBCs , TWIST1 and snail homologue 2 ( SNAI2 / SLUG ) were expressed at high levels , whereas SNAI3 was overexpressed in claudin - low tumors . Thus , claudin - low tumors and MBCs may be enriched for stem cell - like and EMT markers , features that may contribute to poor patient outcomes ( Supple - mentary Fig . S2 ; refs . 2 , 3 ) . Genes that are altered at the genomic and transcriptional levels in MBC . Three hundred six genes ( Supplementary Table S5 ) in the SAM - derived MBC transcriptome localized to areas of chromosomal gain and loss in at least 33 % of MBCs ( Supplemen - tary Fig . S6 A and B ) . Thus , these genes show coordinate changes at the DNA and RNA levels in MBC . Functional analysis of these genes ( Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 ) showed that , among genes that are amplified and overexpressed in MBCs , components of three major branches ( JNK , MAPK , and p38 ) that compose the MAPK signaling pathway are significantly overrepresented in MBCs . Compatible with this finding , phosphorylation of three of four assessed protein components of these pathways [ JNK ( P = 0 . 06 ) , MEK ( P = 0 . 003 ) , and p38 ( P = 0 . 0008 ) but not ERK1 / 2 ( P = NS ) ] was higher in MBCs versus all other breast cancers . Comparison of the MBC and claudin - low transcriptional profiles with a CD44 + / CD24 (cid:1) / low breast cancer cell profile . Given their enrichment for stem cell markers , we compared the transcriptional signatures of MBCs and other breast cancers with a ‘‘tumorigenic’’ signature 13 that was derived by comparing gene expression profiles of flow - sorted CD44 + / CD24 (cid:1) / low breast tumor cells with profiles of all other sorted cells ( CD44 (cid:1) / CD24 + and CD44 (cid:1) / CD24 (cid:1) ) . In contrast to other breast cancers , except for tumors of the ‘‘claudin - low’’ subtype , most of the MBCs showed a clear association with the ‘‘tumorigenic’’ signature ( Fig . 4 ) . Further , of 373 and 217 down - regulated genes in the MBC and ‘‘tumori - genic’’ signatures , respectively , there were 29 shared genes ( Supplementary Table S8 ; P = 1 (cid:2) 10 - 13 for the overlap ) ; 5 of these 29 genes were components of the claudin - low gene cluster . In Figure 3 . Expression of claudin - low and stem cell markers in breast cancer subgroups . Using data from transcriptional profiling , metaplastic ( Metap ) and claudin - low tumors express low levels of claudins CLDN3 , CLDN4 , and CLDN7 of CDH1 ( E - cadherin ) and high CD44 / CD24 and CD29 / CD24 ratios . P values ( ANOVA ) . P values for the metaplastic - basal comparison of stem cell markers were 0 . 41 ( BMI1 ) , 0 . 19 ( CD44 ) , 0 . 004 ( CD29 ) , 0 . 00009 ( CD24 ) , 0 . 00006 ( CD44 / CD24 ratio ) , and 0 . 00007 ( CD29 / CD24 ratio ) .

CAN - 08 - 3441 addition , as has been shown with the claudin - low signature , 13 the MBC signature is enriched in post - docetaxel and post - letrozole treatment specimens ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . These data collec - tively suggest that , at diagnosis , MBCs and claudin - low tumors possess transcriptional features that are enriched in highly purified breast tumor - initiating and chemoresistant breast cancer cell fractions ( 50 ) , the latter also compatible with an enrichment for stem cell - like activity . Discussion MBCs are aggressive , chemoresistant tumors associated with poor outcomes ( 2 , 3 ) . Although uncommon , MBCs account for several hundred new breast cancer cases every year in the United States , thus representing a therapeutic dilemma for oncologists . With only retrospective case reviews as a basis for making recommenda - tions , it has not been possible to define therapy guidelines . Thus , we sought to determine the relationship of MBCs to common breast cancers , particularly basal - like breast cancers given the common assumption that MBCs are basal - like cancers . We also sought to determine whether the underlying pathophysiology of MBCs would result in the identification of new drug targets . Supplementary Fig . S8 summarizes the features of MBC defined in this study that have potential clinical and therapeutic utility . Due to low expression of hormone receptors and HER - 2 as well as expression of some basal epithelial markers , MBCs have been pro - posed to represent a form of basal - like breast cancer ( 4 ) . How - ever , based on the integrated analyses herein , most MBCs likely represent an independent subtype that is distinct from basal - like cancers . Their transcriptional profiles are most closely related to claudin - low cancers , a novel subgroup of receptor - negative breast cancers that are clearly different from basal - like cancers ( Supple - mentary Fig . S3 ) . Comparative genomic hybridization profiles , their enrichment for stem cell - like markers , and their PI3K / AKT pathway activation status also differentiate MBCs from basal - like cancers . MBCs , like claudin - low cancers , express high levels of EMT markers and show elevated CD44 / CD24 and CD29 / CD24 ratios , which have been proposed to represent breast cancer stem cell - like markers ( 46 ) . Indeed , a recent study detected a direct and causative link between EMT and the gain of epithelial stem cell properties ( 51 ) . These features likely contribute to the lineage plasticity of MBCs on light microscopy and to their limited chemoresponsive - ness ( 2 , 3 ) . Claudin - low features , including EMT and stem cell - like properties , also potentially contribute to the aggressive phenotype of MBCs . This is supported by the significant overlap between the MBC signature and the ‘‘tumorigenic’’ signature , 13 with overlapping genes including five of the claudin - low genes ( Supplementary Fig . S3C ) . The MBC , the ‘‘tumorigenic , ’’ and the claudin - low signatures are all enriched in residual post - treatment chemo - resistant breast tumors . Thus , MBCs and claudin - low breast tumors may arise from a more primitive and chemoresistant ‘‘stem’’ cell than luminal or basal - like tumors . The pattern of chromosomal gains and losses in MBCs is distinct from that in other breast cancers including basal - like cancers . This unique pattern suggests that the processes underlying metaplastic carcinogenesis are distinct from those associated with other breast cancer subtypes . MBCs show a high frequency of mutation , amplification , and activation of PI3K / AKT pathway components . This is markedly different from basal - like breast cancers , where we and others have shown that PI3K / AKT pathway genomic mutations are uncommon ( 12 , 27 ) . 15 We also did not detect PIK3CA mutations in 14 claudin - low breast cancers pointing to differences between claudin - low breast cancers and MBCs . The frequency of PIK3CA and PTEN mutations combined with amplification of AKT and p70S6K suggests that PI3K / AKT pathway activation is critical to metaplastic carcinogenesis . Activation of this pathway , along with enrichment for tumor - initiating / stem cells , may underlie the chemoresistance and poor outcomes associated with MBC ( 28 – 30 ) . MBCs also show a high frequency of amplification , overexpression , and activation of MAPK pathway components . As particularly important genes and targets in cancer are likely to be aberrant at the level of the genome , transcriptome , and proteome , the PI3K / AKT and MAPK pathways are therefore Figure 4 .

CAN - 08 - 3441 potentially attractive therapy targets in MBC . As inhibitors of the PI3K / AKT and MAPK pathways are now in clinical trials , it will be of interest to determine whether these inhibitors will sensitize MBCs to cytotoxic drugs ( 52 ) . As there are no MBC cell lines or animal models available , it will be necessary to develop a con - sortium approach to test this hypothesis in patients . In contrast to a recently published study , mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1 were not identified in 19 MBCs in our study ( 53 ) . This may in part relate to the fact that our study was restricted to high - grade MBCs , whereas the previous study included a significant proportion of lower - grade MBCs , tumors that behave in a less aggressive fashion than high - grade MBCs . This study has several potential limitations . Although a subset ( 6 of 12 , 50 % ) of MBCs constitute a significantly related group of tumors as defined by SigClust , it is clear that MBCs form a somewhat heterogeneous group of receptor - negative breast cancers in terms of their molecular characteristics . Just as breast tumors that are defined as ductal are clearly heterogeneous based on receptor status and transcriptional profiling , it is not surpris - ing that MBCs represent a molecularly heterogeneous group . MBCs are microscopically heterogeneous , with this study being limited to tumors with squamous and sarcomatoid metaplasia ( 1 – 7 ) . The rarity of MBC precluded analysis of other histologic variants . In addition , it is possible that MBC represents multiple different diseases . However , there were no clear correlation between the pattern of gene copy number change and the histologic appearance of the tumors analyzed . The major conclusions of this article are ( a ) MBCs are molecularly distinct from other breast cancers ; ( b ) despite their relative histologic uniformity , MBCs are molecularly heteroge - neous ; and ( c ) claudin - low breast cancers are likely the most closely related ductal breast cancer subset to MBCs . The molecular mechanisms underlying metaplastic carcinogenesis are likely different from those associated with other breast cancer subtypes including basal - like cancers . By gene expression analysis , MBCs and claudin - low tumors share common features that suggest related cellular origins , potentially from a more primitive cell than that implicated as a precursor to luminal or basal - like tumors . It is likely that MBCs , and potentially claudin - low tumors , define a novel chemoresistant triple - negative breast cancer subgroup that exhibits a signature similar to that of breast tumor - initiating cells and of residual common breast tumor cells isolated after patient treatment . The frequency of PI3K / AKT pathway aberrations argues that this pathway should be explored as a therapeutic target in MBC . A challenge to advancing therapy for MBC patients is the infrequency of this disease . However , a centralized clinical trial effort is a feasible venture that will improve patient outcomes .
