Published online 19 March 2009 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nprot . 2009 . 22 Over the past decade , lentiviral vectors have emerged as powerful tools for transgene delivery . The use of lentiviral vectors has become commonplace and applications in the ﬁelds of neuroscience , hematology , developmental biology , stem cell biology and transgenesis are rapidly emerging . Also , lentiviral vectors are at present being explored in the context of human clinical trials . Here we describe improved protocols to generate highly concentrated lentiviral vector pseudotypes involving different envelope glycoproteins . In this protocol , vector stocks are prepared by transient transfection using standard cell culture media or serum - free media . Such stocks are then concentrated by ultracentrifugation and / or ion exchange chromatography , or by precipitation using polyethylene glycol 6000 , resulting in vector titers of up to 10 10 transducing units per milliliter and above . We also provide reliable real - time PCR protocols to titrate lentiviral vectors based on proviral DNA copies present in genomic DNA extracted from transduced cells or on vector RNA . These production / concentration methods result in high - titer vector preparations that show reduced toxicity compared with lentiviral vectors produced using standard protocols involving ultracentrifugation - based methods . The vector production and titration protocol described here can be completed within 8 d . INTRODUCTION The protocol described here outlines facile procedures to prepare , concentrate and titrate lentiviral vectors based on HIV - 1 . Lentiviral vectors are traditionally produced by transient cotransfection of human embryonic kidney 293T cells using recombinant plasmids carrying transgene sequences , sequences encoding helper ( packa - ging ) functions and sequences encoding Env glycoproteins , respec - tively . The vesicular stomatitis virus Env glycoprotein ( VSV - G ) is typically used 1 – 4 , although a wide range of alternative glycoproteins have the ability to associate with the vector’s membrane , a process that is referred to as pseudotyping 5 . Typical vector titers range from 10 6 to 10 7 transducing units per milliliter . Increased titers can be achieved by physical concentration . This has opened up the way to generate highly concentrated vector stocks for in vivo applica - tions 6 , 7 . However , lentiviral vectors bearing VSV - G at high concen - trations can be cytotoxic 8 . Fortunately , such toxicity issues can be partially overcome by using alternative pseudotypes 9 , 10 or improved vector concentration / puriﬁcation procedures , including protocols based on anion exchange chromatography 10 . Here we outline simpliﬁed protocols for lentiviral vector concentration involving membrane - based anion exchange chromatography or precipitation using polyethylene glycol 6000 ( PEG 6000 ) . These methods were found to result in vector stocks showing reduced toxicity compared with the standard protocols involving ultracentrifugation 10 . The widespread use of VSV - G to pseudotype lentiviral vectors has made this glycoprotein the standard against which the useful - ness of other viral glycoproteins to form pseudotypes are com - pared . Comparison of pseudotype efﬁciency inevitably means comparing vector titers on cell lines in vitro . This brings up two important issues : ( i ) techniques to determine lentiviral vector titers and ( ii ) cell lines chosen for titration of such vectors . There are different measures used to determine lentiviral vector titers . Some of them are based on the number of vector particles present in a vector stock , whereas others are derived from the number of proviral copies in transduced target cells . Vector particle numbers can be determined using real - time PCR based on strong - stop cDNA present in virions 11 . Alternatively , the amount of virus proteins present in vector cores , such as p24 , are determined by ELISA to arrive at relative particle titers 12 . Unfortunately , titers based on p24 tend to be unreliable 10 , 13 . Functional titration assays are based on vector - encoded reporter gene expression . For exam - ple , vectors encoding green ﬂuorescent protein ( EGFP ) have been titrated using ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) analysis 14 . For vectors that do not contain a reporter gene , proviral DNA copy numbers determined by real - time PCR using DNA extracted from transduced cells have been used to determine vector titers 9 , 14 – 17 . As each of these methods produces different results , close attention must be paid to the titration method used . Here we present detailed real - time PCR protocols to titrate lentiviral vectors based on either vector DNA sequences present in transduced cell DNA or vector RNA present in vector particles . Advantages of vector DNA - based titration methods are that they are independent of the transgene and promoter sequences being used . Thus , they are generally applicable . Titration methods based on RNA derived from vector particles are particularly useful for adjusting lentiviral vector stocks bearing alternative Env glycoproteins . Also , they are more reliable than titration assays based on p24 ( see ref . 10 ) . Again , it must be kept in mind that assays based on vector - derived RNA or on p24 do not reﬂect functional vector titers . Also signiﬁcant for titration is the cell line used because receptors for a given Env glycoprotein may vary from cell line to cell line , possibly producing a falsely depressed titer . Frequently , a given cell line ( such as HeLa or 293 cells ) is chosen because it is considered generally permissive to transduction rather than representing the natural tropism of the virus from which the glycoprotein was derived . Additionally , results produced with a given cell line or type of cell in vitro do not always translate into comparable results in vivo due to puo r G gn i h s il bu P e r u t a N 9002 © n a t u r e p r o t o c o l s / m o c . e r u t a n . www / / : p tt h NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL . 4 NO . 4 | 2009 | 495 PROTOCOL factors such as complement - mediated inactivation of vectors . The protocol presented here addresses some of the shortcomings of earlier protocols 7 by providing generally applicable assays for titrating lentiviral vector pseudotypes based on either proviral DNA copies present in genomic DNA extracted from transduced cells or cDNA prepared using RNA extracted from vector particles . We expect our protocols to be generally useful for the production , concentration , and titration using second or third - generation lentiviral vectors bearing alternative glycoproteins , provided that such pseudotypes are sufﬁ - ciently stable to withstand concentration by ultracentrifugation or precipitation using PEG 6000 or anion exchange chromatography . Experimental design Production of lentiviral vectors . The production protocols outlined in this protocol were optimized in the context of our second - generation lentiviral vector system 9 . However , these proto - cols are compatible with other second - and third - generation lentiviral vector systems . For optimal results , the relative amounts of the transgene - containing plasmid , the packaging plasmid ( s ) and the Env plasmid will need to be optimized on a case - by - case basis . Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) containing 10 % ( vol / vol ) fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) is typically used for the produc - tion of lentiviral vectors that are subsequently concentrated by ultracentrifugation . If the vectors are to be used for cell transduc - tion without previous concentration , alternative media may have to be considered . For example , unconcentrated lentiviral vector stocks produced using DMEM / 10 % FBS appeared to be toxic to primary cortical neuronal cultures , whereas lentiviral vectors produced in serum - free UltraCULTURE medium were not 18 . The production and handling of lentiviral vectors should be carried out using the proper biosafety containment . See Biosafety Considerations for Research with Lentiviral Vectors ( http : / / oba . od . nih . gov / oba / rac / Guidance / LentiVirus _ Containment / pdf / Lenti _ Containment _ Guidance . pdf ) . Concentration of lentiviral vector stocks . For cell transduction in vitro , crude ( unconcentrated ) vector stocks are often sufﬁcient , whereas concentrated vector stocks are needed for in vivo applications . Concentration of lentiviral vector stocks are typically performed using ultracentrifugation approaches 6 . This is a rapid and robust method for vector concentration at a small scale . Inclusion of a sucrose cushion during ultracentrifugation has been shown to be beneﬁcial in terms of reducing vector toxicity . For example , it was shown to reduce systemic immune responses to vector proteins as well as brain inﬂammation exerted by VSV - G pseudotypes 19 . Anion exchange chromatography of lentiviral vec - tor - containing cell culture supernatants using Mustang Q anion exchange membrane cartridges 10 or precipitation of lentiviral vectors using PEG 6000 ( see ref . 20 ) are particularly useful for processing large volumes of lentiviral vector supernatants . Also , lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with VSV - G and puriﬁed on Mus - tang Q anion exchange membrane cartridges were found to be less toxic in the context of in vitro applications involving mouse mesenchymal stem cells 10 . Titration of lentiviral vectors . Flow cytometric ( FACS ) methods provide a convenient way to titrate lentiviral vectors expressing ﬂuorescent proteins such as EGFP 6 , 9 or DsRed 14 . However , the success of this method ultimately depends on the promoter sequences being used for transgene expression . Quantitative PCR methods that determine the number of vector copies associated with genomic DNA extracted from transduced cells provide a more general method for vector titration that is independent of the transgene and promoter sequences present in the vector 9 , 16 . Assays that determine the number of vector particles based on virion RNA 10 , 15 or on p24 ( see refs . 21 , 22 ) are particularly useful for adjusting lentiviral vector stocks bearing alternative Env glycoproteins . Controls . Vector stocks that are generated using packaging constructs lacking a functional reverse transcriptase provide useful controls to rule out carryover of plasmid DNA during titration of vector stocks using quantitative PCR methods 9 . Such vector stocks should show negligible amounts of vector copies .

Prepare new standards every 2 months Unexpectedly high vector copy numbers in transduced cell DNA DNA contamination due to plasmid carryover Make sure DNaseI treatment was included after transduc - tion of HOS cells to prevent plasmid carryover Prepare control vector stocks in parallel using a package construct ( pCD / NL - BH * vpu / RT (cid:2) ) lacking a functionalRT 9 . Such vector stocks should show negligible amounts of vector copies High backgrounds in RT - PCR control reactions lacking RT DNA carryover Use dedicated area that is free of plasmid DNA to set up RT - PCRs Make sure that DNaseI treatment is included during the preparation of vector RNA to degrade plasmid DNA that is carried over with the vectors Higher - than - expected relative vector particle numbers after RT - PCR DNA carryover Make sure DNaseI and RNaseA treatments are carried out properly .

The various concentration steps will ultimately result in titers up to 10 10 IU ml (cid:2) 1 ( Table 2 ) . Vector pseudotypes involving the VSV - G glycoprotein are relatively nontoxic as far as target cells in vitro are concerned if puriﬁed by ultracentrifugation involving a sucrose cushion 10 . Inclusion of an anion exchange chromatography step will further reduce cell toxicity . In general , pseudotypes bearing Env glycoproteins other than VSV - G appear to be less toxic to target cells in vitro 9 , 10 . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by NIH grant NS044832 .
