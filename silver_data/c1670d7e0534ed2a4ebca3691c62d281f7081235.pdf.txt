Abstract Although organ fibrosis causes significant morbidity and mortality in chronic diseases , the lack of detailed knowledge about specific cellular contributors mediating fibrogenesis hampers the design of effective anti - fibrotic therapies . Different cellular sources including tissue - resident and bone marrow - derived fibroblasts , pericytes and epithelial cells have been suggested to give rise to myofibroblasts , but their relative contributions remain controversial , with profound differences between organs and different diseases . Here we employ a novel Cre - transgenic mouse that marks 99 % of hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , a liver - specific pericyte population , to demonstrate that HSCs give rise to 82 - 96 % of myofibroblasts in models of toxic , cholestatic and fatty liver disease . Moreover , we exclude that HSCs function as facultative epithelial progenitor cells in the injured liver . On the basis of these findings , HSCs should be considered the primary cellular target for anti - fibrotic therapies across all types of liver disease . Introduction Fibrotic diseases account for up to 45 % of deaths in developed countries , but we still lack effective anti - fibrotic therapies 1 . Knowledge about cells contributing to the myofibroblast pool and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) production in organ fibrosis is important for designing targeted therapies 2 , 3 . Several cell populations including tissue - resident or bone marrow - derived fibroblasts , pericytes and epithelial cells have been suggested as relevant Users may view , print , copy , download and text and data - mine the content in such documents , for the purposes of academic research , subject always to the full Conditions of use : http : / / www . nature . com / authors / editorial _ policies / license . html # terms Correspondence : Robert F .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t contributors to the myofibroblast pool 2 , 3 but their contribution varies between organs and different diseases , and remains a matter of debate . Liver fibrosis occurs as a result of chronic liver disease and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality 4 . Hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) , a pericyte - like cell population of the liver , and portal fibroblasts are widely considered the most relevant sources of hepatic myofibroblasts , but their precise contribution remains unknown . It is thought that the underlying liver disease determines the cell types that contribute to the myofibroblast pool , with profound differences between toxic and cholestatic liver diseases , and portal fibroblast exerting a key role in the latter 4 - 7 . Other cell types such as bone marrow - derived fibrocytes may also contribute to the myofibroblast pool , but to a lesser degree 8 , 9 . However , most evidence about relevant myofibroblast sources and functions derives from cell isolates and in vitro studies 10 - 12 , whereas in vivo studies quantifying the relative contribution of different cell populations in the fibrotic liver are missing . In this regard , fate - tracing studies have excluded a contribution of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes to the myofibroblast pool 13 - 15 , but positive identification of cell types contributing to the myofibroblast pool by fate - tracing is lacking . As such , previous studies employing collagen - driven Cre or Wt1 - Cre have tracked either all collagen - producing myofibroblasts but not specific cellular sources of myofibroblasts 12 ; or mesothelial cells , which give rise to subcapsular fibroblasts within 150 μm of the liver surface but not to intrahepatic myofibroblasts , i . e . those that cause organ fibrosis and its deleterious complications 16 . Attempts at fate - tracing HSCs , one of the prime candidates 4 , 11 , 17 , using Cre driven by the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter ( hGFAPCre ) are hampered by the fact that hGFAPCre marks cholangiocytes 18 , 19 ( https : / / ndp . jax . org / NDPServe . dll ? ViewItem ? ItemID = 1741 & XPos = 11536496 & YPos = 5169511 & ZPos = 0 & Lens = 1 . 25 & SignIn = Sign % 20in % 20as % 20Guest ) , thereby limiting interpretation . Here we employ a novel fate tracing method for HSCs to demonstrate that HSCs are the dominant contributors to collagen - producing myofibroblasts in models of toxic , biliary and fatty liver fibrosis . Moreover , we exclude that HSCs serve as facultative epithelial progenitors in the injured liver . Results LratCre but not hGFAPCre labels HSCs Using three different Cre reporters , we confirmed that hGFAPCre mice labeled bile ducts and cytokeratin 19 - expressing cholangiocytes ( Fig . 1A , E - H ) . Of note , hGFAPCre mice did not efficiently mark HSCs or collagen - producing myofibroblasts ( Fig . 1B - G ) . Likewise , mice expressing Cre under the murine Gfap promoter did not label HSCs ( Fig . 1I ) . To achieve faithful labeling of HSCs , we generated a bacterial artifical chromosome ( BAC ) transgenic mouse in which Cre expression is driven by lecithin - retinol acyltransferase ( Lrat ) ( Supplementary Fig . S1B ) . Lrat was selected in screens among several candidates because of high expression in HSCs , virtually undetectable expression in hepatocytes , Kupffer cells and cholangiocytes ( Fig . 2A ) , and its key role in the formation of retinyl ester - containing lipid droplets , one of the defining features of HSCs 20 . In contrast to a previous study 21 , we also did not detect Lrat protein or mRNA expression in endothelial cells ( Fig . 2A , Mederacke et al . Page 2 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 June 16 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Supplementary Fig . S1A ) . LratCre - transgenic mice marked 99 % of HSCs as demonstrated by flow - cytometry and immunohistochemistry in two different Cre reporter mice , showing nearly complete overlap of HSC markers desmin and Pdgfr β with LratCre - induced ZsGreen Cre reporter by confocal microscopy , no significant overlap with hepatocyte , macrophage , and cholangiocyte markers and only few spots of overlap with endothelial cell markers , most likely due to their very close proximity to HSCs ( Fig . 2B - E , Supplementary Fig . S1C - G ) . HSCs are the main contributors to toxic liver fibrosis To determine the contribution of HSCs to the myofibroblast pool , we first subjected LratCre mice to the well - established model of carbon tetrachloride ( CCl 4 ) - induced liver fibrosis . In this model , LratCre - induced ZsGreen expression - marking HSCs - and α SMA expression - marking myofibroblasts - completely overlapped , and displayed micro - and macroscopic ZsGreen fluorescence with the characteristic septal pattern of liver fibrosis ( Fig . 3A - B ) . To determine the relative contribution of HSCs to the myofibroblast pool , we quantified the overlap between LratCre - induced Cre reporter and α SMA . In CCl 4 - induced liver fibrosis , the overlap between LratCre - induced ZsGreen and α SMA was 93 . 6 % ( ±2 . 3 % SD , n = 4 , Fig . 3B ) , providing evidence that HSCs are the almost exclusive source of myofibroblasts in toxic liver fibrosis . To confirm this data by a second approach , we generated LratCre mice co - expressing red - fluorescent Cre reporter tdTomato and a green - fluorescent Col - GFP reporter , which faithfully marks collagen - producing cells 22 . LratCre - induced tdTomato almost completely overlapped with Col - GFP fluorescence in the CCl 4 model ( 96 . 0 % ±2 . 4 % SD , n = 4 . Fig . 3B ) , thus matching the degree of overlap that we found between α SMA and LratCre - induced ZsGreen . Accordingly , nearly all α SMA - positive cells were also Col - GFP - positive ( Fig . 3C ) . To exclude that our data may be specific to the CCl 4 model , we confirmed our findings in a second well - established model of toxic liver fibrosis , induced by thioacetamide ( TAA ) treatment . Livers from TAA - induced treated mice also displayed a characteristic macro - and microscopic septal pattern of ZsGreen fluorescence , and the same range of co - localization between LratCre - induced TdTomato and Col - GFP fluorescence ( 94 . 8 % ±0 . 3 % SD , n = 3 ) as in the CCl 4 model ( Supplementary Fig . S2A - C ) . To further substantiate the functional contribution of HSCs to fibrogenesis , we ablated HSCs via LratCre - induced diphtheria toxin receptor . This strategy strongly reduced HSC numbers in untreated and CCl 4 - treated livers , albeit not completely ( Fig . 3D - E , Supplementary Fig . S3A ) . However , it should be noted that this approach typically does not result in complete ablation unless a strongly intensified regimen of diptheria toxin injection is employed 23 . The reduction of α SMA and profibrogenic gene expression by at least the same degree as ablation of HSCs , assessed by desmin mRNA and immunohistochemisty ( Fig . 3D - E ) , confirms the relevant contribution of HSCs to fibrogenesis . In contrast , hepatic inflammation , injury and expression of endothelial marker vWf were not affected by HSC ablation ( Supplementary Fig . S3B - D ) . HSCs are the main contributors to biliary liver fibrosis After having established HSCs as main contributors to toxic liver fibrosis , we next determined the contribution of HSCs to cholestatis - induced liver fibrosis . In this setting , portal fibroblasts are believed to be an essential contributor to fibrogenesis 4 , 5 , 7 . In three Mederacke et al . Page 3 Nat Commun .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t well - established models of cholestasis - induced liver fibrosis , bile duct ligation ( BDL ) , 3 , 5 - diethoxycarbonyl - 1 , 4 - dihydro - collidin ( DDC ) - containing diet , and Mdr2 ko mice , tdTomato expression almost completely overlapped with Col - GFP reporter expression , reaching > 89 % co - localization and thus almost the same degree as in toxic liver fibrosis ( Fig . 4A - C , E ) . This data was confirmed by flow - cytometric analysis of the entire non - parenchymal cell pool , in which 82 - 85 % of collagen - producing cells were tdTomato - positive HSCs ( Fig . 4D - E ) . A high contribution of HSCs to collagen - producing cells was even noted during early cholestatic liver fibrosis ( 87 - 90 % co - localization , Supplementary Fig . S4A - D , G ) , and in the methionine - choline - deficient diet model of non - alcoholic steatohepatitis disease ( Supplementary Fig . S4E - F ) . Similar to the CCl 4 - induced fibrosis , LratCre not only marked collagen - producing cells but also α SMA - expressing cells , with 80 % and 88 % overlap between α SMA and LratCre - induced tdTomato after 7d and 14d BDL , respectively , and a strong overlap between α SMA - positive and Col - GFP - positive cells ( Supplementary Fig . S5A - B ) . Lrat - negative portal fibroblasts - like cells are distinct from HSCs In addition to LratCre - labeled , Col - GFP - positive HSCs , we also found a small population of Col - GFP - positive but LratCre - unlabeled fibroblasts , both in the liver and in cell isolates of cholestatic fibrosis models . These cells were predominantly located around the portal tracts , and did not contain retinoid lipid droplets , consistent with characteristics of portal fibroblasts ( Fig . 4F , H ) . This LratCre - negative , Col - GFP - positive population of portal fibroblast - like cells ( PLFC ) showed low expression of genes characteristic for HSCs , such as Lrat , Lhx2 and HGF , and was morphologically distinct from HSCs ( Fig . 4G - H ) . PFLC were α SMA - and Col - GFP positive , and abundantly expressed Acta2 , Col1a1 , Lox , Timp1 and Vim in comparison to whole liver ( Supplementary Fig . S6A - B ) , confirming them as myofibroblasts . However , they expressed significantly lower levels of fibrogenic genes than HSCs in our isolates ( Fig . 4G ) , thus excluding that PFLC might represent a less abundant , but more fibrogenic population than HSCs . Together , these data indicate that portal fibroblast constitute a myofibroblast population that is not HSC - derived and significantly less abundant than HSCs , and likely fulfils specialized functions in cholestatic liver disease . Myofibroblasts derive from LratCre - labelled retinoid - positive HSCs α SMA staining in normal liver ( where HSCs are quiescent and do not express α SMA ) revealed that LratCre also labeled some vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs , Supplementary Fig . S7A ) . This may be explained by the fact that VSMCs and pericytes / HSCs are considered to be of the same lineage 24 , sharing a common precursor in the liver 25 . Although LratCre - labeled HSCs outnumbered LratCre - labeled VSMCs by a factor of > 200 ( Supplementary Fig . S7B ) , we wanted to further exclude a major contribution of LratCre - labeled VSMCs , or any other non - HSC population to the hepatic collagen - producing fibroblast pool . As specific labeling of hepatic VSMCs is not feasible , we employed retinoid fluorescence to identify LratCre - labeled myofibroblasts of HSC origin . Retinoid fluorescence was observed in > 90 % of tdTomato - and Col - GFP - positive cells in the CCl 4 , BDL and Mdr2 ko fibrosis models ( Supplementary Fig . S7C - D ) , albeit at a lower level than in quiescent HSCs , thus confirming that these myofibroblasts are of HSC and not of VSMC Mederacke et al . Page 4 Nat Commun .

Collectively , our data establish HSCs as principal contributors to the collagen - producing myofibroblast pool across all types of liver fibrosis . HSCs are not epithelial progenitors Next , we determined whether HSCs may exert functions besides fibrogenesis in liver injury . Previous studies , employing hGFAP - Cre and α SMA - CreERT2 mice for fate - tracing , suggested that up to 24 % of hepatocytes were derived from HSCs in the methionine - choline - deficient ethionine - supplemented ( MCDE ) diet and BDL models 18 , 19 . Employing LratCre mice , we tested whether short - and long - term injury induced by BDL , Mdr2 ko , MCDE diet , DDC diet , CCl 4 , TAA or 70 % partial hepatectomy resulted in the generation of HNF4 α - positive hepatocytes expressing ZsGreen Cre reporter , thus identifying them as progeny of LratCre - expressing HSCs . Although we found rare HNF4a - positive hepatocytes ( at a frequency of ≈ 0 . 2 per 1 , 000 cells ) expressing Cre reporter ZsGreen , none of the injury models increased this rate in the liver ( Fig . 5A - G , Supplementary Fig . S8A - C ) . We also did not observe increased ZsGreen - positive cells with hepatocyte morphology ( positive control shown in the insert of Fig . 5A ) in liver sections ( Fig . 5a - f , and Supplementary Fig . 8B - C ) , or in primary hepatocyte isolates ( Fig . 5HI , Supplementary Fig . S8D ) . Furthermore , LratCre - marked cells did not give rise to cytokeratin - positive liver progenitor cells or cholangiocytes in any of the chronic injury models ( Fig . 2E , Supplementary Fig . S9A - E ) . Collectively , these data exclude that HSCs function as epithelial progenitors . LratCre - positive HSCs are not bone marrow - derived Finally , we employed Lrat - Cre mice to assess whether HSCs constitute a liver - resident or bone marrow - derived cell population , a point of substantial controversy 26 - 28 . We did not detect LratCre - labeled HSCs in normal liver or fibrotic livers after BDL or long - term injury induced by 20 CCl 4 injections despite successful BM transplantation as evidenced by mTom - positive ( i . e . non - recombined ) BM - derived cells in the spleen and mTom - and F4 / 80 - double - positive BM - derived macrophages in the liver ( Fig . 6A - C ) . These data confirm HSCs as liver - resident cell population . Discussion Despite the lack of solid in vivo evidence that HSCs are the primary drivers of liver fibrosis , much of the current research and drug discovery work focus on this cell type . After the discovery that HSCs produce significantly larger amounts of collagen than hepatocytes and endothelial cells in vitro and thus constitute a prime candidate for hepatic myofibroblast precursors 11 , little progress has been made to further establish and precisely quantify the relative contribution of HSCs to the hepatic myofibroblast pool and liver fibrosis in vivo . Most subsequent studies have investigated HSC activation in cell cultures , a process that differs substantially from in vivo activation 10 , 29 , or studied HSC isolates from normal and fibrotic livers 10 , 12 . Because of the lack of fate tracing techniques that specifically label precursor populations such as HSCs , sources of hepatic myofibroblasts have not yet been established or precisely quantified in vivo . Fate - tracing has excluded a contribution for epithelial cells to the hepatic myofibroblast pool 13 - 15 , and characterized the embryonic origin of HSCs 16 . However , positive identification of myofibroblast precursors has not been Mederacke et al . Page 5 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 June 16 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t achieved as fate - tracing approaches have either labeled all myofibroblast populations but not specific precursors 13 , or subpopulations such as subcapsular fibroblasts that contribute little to organ fibrosis and the deleterious complications of fibrosis due to their sparsity and anatomic location 16 . The most important finding of our study is the in vivo identification of HSCs as a universal and liver - resident source for myofibroblasts , exerting a dominant role across toxic , biliary and fatty liver diseases . These data suggest that HSCs should be considered the primary target for the development of new anti - fibrotic therapies , which has become an important focus of the field 30 - 32 . Revealing HSCs as the by far dominant source in cholestatic fibrosis is unexpected as portal fibroblasts have been considered a key contributor in cholestatic liver fibrosis 4 , 5 , 7 . The consistently high contribution of HSCs was observed in three different models of cholestasis , including the Mdr2ko model , which mimicks defects in cholestatic patients 33 . Thus , our data refute the hypothesis that the underlying disease dictates the cell type that contributes to the myofibroblast pool in liver fibrosis , and instead establish HSCs as universal responders that trigger wound repair across different types of liver injury . Despite the dominant role of HSCs , there was a higher contribution of non - HSC myofibroblast sources in biliary than in toxic liver fibrosis . Accordingly , we identified a population of LratCre - negative fibroblasts around portal tracts that were distinct from HSCs in terms of gene expression and anatomic localization . Despite being less abundant than HSCs , these cells most likely exert important functions in cholestatic liver disease . While portal fibroblasts probably do not make a major contribution to organ fibrosis and associated complications such as portal hypertension due to their low abundance , their anatomic localization suggests that they may exert specialized functions related to bile ducts . This might be the mechanical stabilization of bile ducts as an adaptive response to increased pressure , or a contribution to biliary stenosis as a maladaptive response . It is also conceivable that portal fibroblasts represent a cell population that has a role in early biliary fibrosis serving as “rapid responders” 7 , and that is essential in recruiting HSCs , which then in turn contribute to the majority of ECM production . Further studies should also determine whether LratCre - negative portal fibroblasts may produce different type of ECM than HSCs . The second relevant finding of our study is that HSCs are not progenitor cells , and do not contribute to the generation of hepatocytes in the injured liver . Previous studies had suggested that HSCs contribute up to 24 % of newly formed hepatocytes 18 , 19 . As we labelled 99 % of HSCs by LratCre and investigated their contribution to hepatocyte generation in liver sections from seven different injury models and in primary hepatocyte isolates from two injury models , in the liver and in hepatocyte isolates without finding increased number of HNF4a - and ZsGreen - double positive cells , or ZsGreen - positive cells with hepatocyte shape , we can exclude HSCs as a source for epithelial regeneration in the liver . Our findings are congruent with studies showing that hepatocytes and to a lesser degree , bipotential progenitors functions as efficient cellular sources for epithelial regeneration 34 - 36 . Finally , our data , showing that GFAPCre transgenic mice efficiently label cholangiocytes but not a significant amount of HSCs , suggests that previous studies employing GFAPCre 13 , 18 , 19 , 37 , 38 are likely not HSC - specific . We cannot completely rule out that there Mederacke et al . Page 6 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 June 16 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t may be differences in the recombination in different floxed alleles or Cre reporters , but have tested three Cre reporters , confirmed GFAPCre by sequencing , tested functional Cre expression in brain sections , and have used mice expressing Cre under the human GFAP as well as the murine Gfap promoter . Furthermore , previous publications 18 , 19 and Jackson Laboratories ( https : / / ndp . jax . org / NDPServe . dll ? ViewItem ? ItemID = 1741 & XPos = 11536496 & YPos = 5169511 & ZPos = 0 & Lens = 1 . 25 & SignIn = Sign % 20in % 20as % 20Guest ) have reported Cre activity in cholangiocytes . Our study has several limitations . First of all , murine fibrogenesis may not fully reflect human fibrogenesis due to its shorter duration , different biology , and difficulties to model all relevant diseases adequately in mice . We have assessed the HSC contribution in a large number of murine models , but human confirmation is warranted . This may be achieved by developing markers that clearly distinguish between HSC and non - HSC myofibroblast populations such as portal fibroblasts . Second of all , LratCre also labeled some VSMCs in our study . This is likely due to the fact that pericytes and VSMCs share a common precursor in many organs , including the liver 24 , 25 . However , we found that more than 90 % of LratCre - labeled myofibroblasts contained retinoid lipid droplets characteristic for HSCs , thus providing strong evidence that LratCre - labeled myofibroblasts are indeed derived from HSCs . Third , it is conceivable that LratCre activity is turned on in non - HSC populations during fibrogenesis , and that we overestimate the contribution of HSCs . However , we found that non - HSC myofiboblast populations such as PLFC were LratCre - negative and distinct from HSC . We also did not find a significant amount of LratCre - labeled hepatocytes , cholangiocytes , endothelial cells or Kupffer cells in CCl 4 - induced liver injury , providing further evidence that LratCre activity is not significantly induced in non - HSC populations in the injured liver . Moreover , the above - discussed finding that more than 90 % of LratCre - positive myofibroblasts also contained retinoids characteristic for HSCs also excludes a significant contribution of non - HSC populations . As such , retinoid lipid droplets are a defining feature of HSCs and the only parameter by which they could be clearly defined to date . Tamoxifen - inducible LratCre would be helpful to further confirm these data and further exclude LratCre activity in other cell types during disease , but is likely to achieve a lower labeling efficacy than constitutive LratCre , and a less precise quantification of HSC contribution to the hepatic myofibroblast pool . Fourth , our isolation of PFLCs may contain cells other than portal fiboblasts as the employed isolation method relied on exclusion of HSCs and not on positive identification . Further establishment of high purity portal fibroblast isolates will allow more powerful qualitative comparison between HSCs and portal fibroblasts . In contrast to the dominant role of HSCs in liver fibrosis , the contribution of pericytes in fibrosis of other organs remains controversial with some studies in kidney , lung and spinal cord 39 - 41 showing a key contribution but other studies reporting opposite findings 42 , 43 . Confirming a key role for pericytes in fibrogenesis in additional organs may allow to determine common targets for anti - fibrotic therapies across different organs . Mederacke et al .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Methods Generation of LratCre mice A Cre - containing cassette was PCR - amplified with 60 - bp overhangs homologous to the upstream and downstream sequence surrounding ATG site of the mouse Lrat gene . The PCR product was inserted into a BAC containing the mouse Lrat gene by recombineering . After removal of the Neo cassette by arabinose - induced flippase , BAC DNA was microinjected into the pronucleus of fertilized CBAxC57BL / 6J oocytes . Out of six positive founders , the one showing the strongest LratCre - induced Cre reporter expression in liver and HSCs was used for further studies . Pups were born in a male / female ratio of 1 : 1 ( 50 . 3 % vs 49 . 7 % , n = 179 ) . Mice and genotyping Mice in which Cre expression is driven by the human GFAP promoter ( hGFAPCre ) 44 , the murine Gfap promoter ( mGfapCre ) 45 and mice expressing Cre reporters ZsGreen , TdTomato 46 or mTom / mGFP 47 were obtained from Jackson . Mdr2ko mice 48 in FVB / N background have been described . For all experiments , LratCre mice were maintained in a mixed background after breeding 1 - 2 times into the ZsGreen , tdTomato reporter , mTom / mGFP strains of the C57Bl / 6 background , or Mdr2ko mice . Mice for HSC isolations were used at ages 12 - 18 weeks . Mice used for fibrosis or injury models , or for non - parenchymal cell isolation were used at ages 8 - 12 weeks unless otherwise indicated . Mice of both genders were used with the exception of the BDL and DDC models for which only male mice were employed . Genotyping for LratCre was done using forward primer 5 ′ - CCTTTCTTTGACCCCCTGCAC and reverse primer 5 ′ - GACCGGCAAACGGACAGAAG . Genotyping for hGFAPCre mice was done using forward primer 5’ - ACTCCTTCATAAAGCCCT and reverse primer 5’ - CGCCGCATAACCAGTGAAAC . The PCR product for hGFAPCre genotyping was sequenced and presence of human GFAP promoter sequence was confirmed . Liver fibrosis and injury models Toxic liver fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injections of either CCl 4 ( 0 . 5 μL / g , dissolved in corn oil at a ratio of 1 : 3 ) for various intervals , or of thioacetamide ( dissolved in NaCl 0 . 9 % ) for 6 weeks ( 3 injections per week ) at increasing concentrations ( first dose : 50 mg / kg , second dose : 100 mg / kg , third to sixth dose : 200 mg / kg , all following doses : 300 mg / kg ) as previously described 49 . For the induction of cholestatic liver fibrosis mice underwent ligation of the common bile duct 27 . Briefly , after abdominal incision , the common bile duct was ligated distally . For additional models of cholestatic liver fibrosis mice were either fed a 0 . 1 % 3 , 5 - diethoxycarbonyl - 1 , 4 - dihydro - collidin ( DDC ) - containing diet for 4 weeks or LratCre mice were crossed with Mdr2ko mice 48 in FVB / N background . ZsGreen , tdTomato and mTom / mGFP Cre reporter mice 46 , 47 as well as Col - GFP reporter 22 mice have been described elsewhere . As a model of fatty liver disease , liver fibrosis was induced by feeding mice a methione - choline - deficient diet for nine weeks . 70 % partial hepatectomy was performed as described 50 . Briefly , after midline abdominal incision , the left lateral and the median liver lobes were mobilized , ligated and cut off 50 . As models of liver injury with progenitor expansion , we employed above described DDC diet , and Mederacke et al . Page 8 Nat Commun . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2014 June 16 .

All animal procedures were in accordance with guidelines by the National Institutes of Health , and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University . Primary cell isolations Hepatic stellate cells were isolated from mice as described previously 49 , 51 . Briefly , after cannulation of the inferior vena cava , the portal vein was cut , allowing retrograde step - wise perfusion with pronase ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , United States ) and collagenase ( Roche , Germany ) containing solutions , and subsequent 9 . 7 % Nycodenz gradient centrifugation . Purity was assessed by vitamin A autofluorescence under a fluorescent microscope ( Olympus 71IX ) . The entire population of non - parenchymal cells was isolated using pronase / collagenase perfusion and a 16 . 95 % Nycodenz gradient . Murine hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion and low - density centrifugation with Percoll 52 . F4 / 80 - positive hepatic macrophages were isolated after collagenase / pronase perfusion , followed by a 16 . 95 % Nycodenz gradient and subsequent positive selection of F4 / 80 - positive cells by magnetic - activated cell sorting ( MACS ) using biotinylated F4 / 80 antibody ( clone : BM8 , eBioscience , San Diego , CA , USA ) and anti - biotin MACS beads ( Miltenyi Biotec , Auburn , CA , USA ) 53 . Based on the specific marking of bile ducts by hGFAPCre , cholangiocytes were isolated by flow cytometry from hGFAPCre mice expressing ZsGreen Cre reporter after pronase / collagenase perfusion of mouse livers . Cholangiocyte identity was confirmed by western blot for cytokeratin 19 . Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells were isolated by collagenase perfusion followed by MACS using anti - CD146 MACS beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and subsequent FACS to exclude HSCs in the isolate 54 . Analysis of vitamin A content and Col - GFP expression Vitamin A fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry in isolated HSCs or non - parenchymal liver cells using 405 - 407 nm lasers for excitation and a 450 / 50 nm bandpass filter for detection . To determine vitamin A expression of activated HSCs , Col - GFP - and tdTomato - double positive cells were gated . Vitamin A - negative cells expressing Col - GFP were used as negative controls to set the threshold for positive signals for Vitamin A . GFP expression was analyzed using 488 nm lasers a 530 / 30 nm bandpass filter for detection . Non - parenchymal liver cell isolations from untreated Col - GFP - positive , LratCre - positive and tdTomoto - positive mice were used to set the threshold for positive Col - GFP signals . TdTomato expression was analyzed using 488 nm lasers a 582 / 15 nm bandpass filter for detection . 4 - 6 independent cell isolates were analyzed for each model , using a minimum for 100 , 000 events for data evaluation . Flow - cytometric data was analyzed by FlowJo software . Bone marrow transplantation Bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) was performed as described previously 27 . Briefly , wild - type mice were macrophage - depleted by injection of liposomal clodronate , followed by lethal irradiation with 2 × 6 Gy and intravenous injection of 10 × 10 6 bone marrow cells from LratCre - positive , mTom / mGFP mice . Successful BMT was confirmed by the presence of mTom - positive cells in spleen and mTom - positive macrophages in the liver . Mederacke et al . Page 9 Nat Commun .

Mouse livers were perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde and embedded . Frozen tissue blocks were cut to yield 5μm sections for immunohistochemical staining 49 using primary antibodies against desmin ( 1 : 300 , rabbit , Lab Vision Cat . No RB - 9014 - P , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Fremont , CA , USA ) , α SMA ( 1 : 500 , mouse , FITC - conjugated , Sigma - Aldrich F3777 ) , Cytokeratin ( 1 : 250 , rabbit , DAKO Z0622 ) , F4 / 80 ( 1 : 250 , rat , AbD serotec MCA497A64 ) , CD31 ( 1 : 500 , rat , Pharmingen 553369 ) , PDGFR β ( 1 : 50 , rabbit , Cell Signaling 3169 ) and HNF4 α ( 1 : 100 , goat , Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC - 6556 ) , and matching secondary anti - rabbit ( 1 : 500 , donkey , A21207 ) , anti - rat ( 1 : 500 , chicken , A21472 ) , anti - FITC ( 1 : 1000 , rabbit , A11090 ) and anti - goat ( 1 . 500 , chicken , A21468 ) with various fluorescent conjugates ( all Invitrogen ) . Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon A1 confocal laser microscope ( Nikon Instruments , Melville , NY , USA ) using a 20× lens or 40× and 60× oil immersion lenses . For some pictures and for quantification , 4 - 6 sections were merged . For macroscopic imaging , livers were visualized under a Leica MZ 16F fluorescent dissecting microscope . Immunoblotting Immunoblotting for Lrat , desmin or cytokeratin was performed on isolated primary hepatic cell populations using a mouse anti - Lrat antibody ( dilution 1 : 5000 ) 55 , desmin ( Lab Vision , 1 : 2000 ) and cytokeratin 19 ( rat , Troma - III , 1 : 1000 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , University of Iowa ) . Briefly , cell or liver lysates were electrophoresed on 10 % acrylamide SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane . Loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining . Blots were blocked in 5 % nonfat dry milk , followed by overnight incubation at 4 degree Celsius with primary antibody , one hour incubation with horse - radish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody . and detection by luminescence ( SuperSignal , Thermoscientfic ) . Specificity of the Lrat antibody was determined using liver extracts from wild - type and Lrat knockout mice ( Supplementary Fig . S10 ) . Blots were reprobed with actin antibody ( 1 : 5000 , MP Biomedicals ) to confirm equal loading . Full - length images of all immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig . S10 . Quantification of positively stained cells HNF4 α - positive hepatocytes were quantified in merged 20× pictures representing 70 - 100 random 20× fields per mouse . Three to four mice per treatment group were analyzed . To determine Col - GFP - positive cells or α SMA - positive cells originating from HSCs at least 50 random 40× pictures were analyzed per mouse . Experiments were performed in three to five animals per treatment group . Quantification of HNF4 α - positive , α SMA - positive cells and Col - GFP - positive cells and determination of co - localization with fluorescent Cre reporters were performed using ImageJ software . Statistical evaluation Statistical analysis was performed using Prism ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA ) . Differences between two groups were calculated by Student ' s t - test . Significance of differences between multiple groups was determined by one - way ANOVA , followed by Dunnett ' s post - hoc test . All data are expressed as means ± standard deviation .

Positive control ( “ + ctrl” ) from AAV8 - TBG - Cre infected mice showing ZsGreen - positive hepatocytes ( n = 1 ) ( H , upper right insert ) . The rare ZsGreen - positive small - size cells were identified as HSCs by their characteristic fluorescent retinoid - containing lipid droplets ( H , lower right inserts ) . ZsGreen - positive hepatocytes were quantified ( I ) . Scale bars , 100 μm . Data are shown as means ± SD . n . s . , non - significant ( one - way ANOVA ) . Mederacke et al . Page 20 Nat Commun .

LratCre - labeled HSCs are not bone marrow - derived A - C . Bone marrow from mice expressing LratCre and mTom / mGFP - Cre reporter was transplanted into lethally irradiated wild - type recipients . Untreated ( n = 2 ) , 20× CCl 4 ( n = 1 ) and 3 weeks BDL ( n = 1 ) treated mice were sacrificed 5 - 6 months after BMT , and showed no LratCre - induced mGFP expression , thus excluding a contribution of the BM to generation of LratCre - expressing HSCs . In contrast , LratCre - positive mice expressing mTom / mGFP , serving as positive control , showed abundant mGFP signal ( A ) . Successful BMT was confirmed by the presence mTom - positive cells in spleen ( see inserts ) and demonstration of F4 / 80 - positive mGFP - expressing liver macrophages ( B ) . HSCs isolated from BM - transplanted mice ( n = 1 ) showed no mGFP signal or by flow - cytometric analysis , whereas controls showed abundant mGFP signal ( n = 4 ) ( C ) . Scale bars 100 μm .
