Introduction Technological innovation is re - shaping the way people work in organizations , virtual work , understood as working through some type of computer - mediated communication ( CMC ) is now a com - monplace among corporate work - groups ( Powell , Piccoli , & Ives , 2004 ) . In other words , groups are nowadays relying more on intranets , cloud computing , video - conferencing or instant messag - ing ( e . g . Skype (cid:2) or similar ) for their day - to - day activities . Enthusiasts of virtual work claim that it has numerous beneﬁts ( Snow , Lipnack , & Stamps , 1999 ) . For example , it enables group members to work remotely ( reducing travel expenses ) and asynch - ronically , meaning that members do not need to be working simul - taneously . Furthermore , it allows for more ﬂexible work schedules ; it increases job autonomy for workgroups ; and it fosters innova - tions , especially in brainstorming tasks ( Wegge , Bipp , & Kleinbeck , 2007 ) . Most importantly , it centers the workgroup focus on task - related concerns ( Zornoza , Ripoll , & Peiró , 2002 ) and ideally increas - ing overall productivity ratios of the workgroup . Empirical research indicates that there may be also some draw - backs to virtual work as well . For example , an increased task - oriented focus reduces the quality of social interactions within the workgroup , which are critical for developing and strengthening a shared sense of group identity . Hence , virtual workgroups should then be particularly susceptible to the emergence of motivational group losses , especially those in which individuals put his or her personal interests before those of the group ( e . g . in instances of social loaﬁng where someone might withold effort when working in a group ; Alnuaimi , Robert , & Maruping , 2009 ) . Furthermore , if group members perceive other members to loaf , they will in turn reduce their individual contributions to their collective effort , harming not only their collective performance , but also the group’s affective work outcomes ( Kerr , 1983 ) , understood as the shared perception of how well the group worked together ( work process satisfaction ) , the result of their work ( result satisfaction ) , or their willingness to belong to the group and work again in the future ( group cohesion ) . We know that the aforementioned negative effects of perceived loaﬁng also occur in virtual workgroups ( Mulvey & Klein , 1998 ) . Unfortunatelly , to our knowledge , no study has explored whether the negative relation between perceived loaﬁng and affective out - comes is stronger under computer mediated communications , or in http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . chb . 2014 . 01 . 013 0747 - 5632 / (cid:2) 2014 Elsevier Ltd .

Addressing this research gap would be particularly useful for managers who would like to have addi - tional information about the pros and cons of implementing virtual work in their companies . In this study , we used a contingent approach to explore if the communication media moderates the relation between perceive loaﬁng and group affective outcomes such as work results , process satisfaction and cohesion . 1 . 1 . Theoretical background Initial theoretical approaches to virtual work , such as media richness theory , explored how the quality of the communication media affected group processes and outcomes ( Dennis & Kinney , 1998 ; Zornoza Abad , Orengo , Gosalvez , & González - Navarro , 2002 ) . A communication media is any device or method used by individualstocommunicatewhiletheyworkinagroup . Inthemedia richness continuum , collocated or face - to - face ( F - t - F ) work has the highestlevelofmediarichness , while text - basedwork suchasinstant messaging ( synchronic ) or e - mail ( asynchronic ) is at the lower end . The main rationale of this theory was that no communication media could yet replicate the high quality ( ﬁdelity ) of collocated human interaction ; and so as media richness decreases , so does the quality ofgroupinteractionanditsrelatedaffectiveoutcomes . Intime , other frameworks emerged , such as social dynamic media theories ( for a review see Rhoads , 2010 ) , namely adaptive structuration theory ( AST ; DeSanctis & Poole , 1994 ) or media naturalness perspective ( MNP ; Kock , 2002 ) . Theseframeworksproposethat , asvirtualwork - groups gain experience workingtogether , they ( 1 ) will learnand de - velop strategies on how to work more effectively with as a team and ( 2 ) will adapt to compensate for the effects of low levels of media richness over group outcomes ( Andriessen & Van der Velden , 1993 ; McGrath & Berdhal , 1998 in Zornoza et al . , 2002 ) . In short , while technology development is essential in media richness theory in order to overcome the negative impact of technology over group processes and results , the enhancement of the social nature of the workgroup achieves the same results in AST and MNO frameworks . Inthislineofthought , socialidentiﬁcation / des - individuationtheory ( SIDE ) extends both social identity and self - categorization theories to virtual work ( Postmes , Spears , & Lea , 1999 ) . According to this the - ory , certainfeaturesofCMC , suchasanonymity , creategreaterclose - ness and intimacy between group members . The main rationale is thatindividuationofgroupmembersunderminethesalienceofpos - siblesocialidentities , whileanonymityshiftsfocusfromindividuals’ differences to group similarities , facilitating the development of a social identity , and its associated positive group outcomes ( Michinov , Michinov , & Toczek - Capelle , 2004 ) . Research on virtual work has developed a consistent body of knowledge about how CMC’s affect group dynamics and outcomes . Systematic comparisons to traditional face - to - face groups used experimental or quasi - experimental designs to explore differences between two or more types of virtual work ( e . g . face - to - face vs . low ﬁdelity CMC such as text - based work ) . Studies in this ﬁeld , in - clude e - leadership ( Bell & Kozlowski , 2002 ; Kayworth & Leidner , 2002 ) , virtual teams management ( Carte , Chidambaram , & Becker , 2006 ; Hertel , Geister , & Konradt , 2005 ) , motivational gains ( Hertel , Deter , & Konradt , 2003 ) and losses ( Beenen et al . , 2004 ; McKinlay , Procter , & Dunnett , 1999 ) . In most of these studies , researchers operationalized outcome variables such as group effectiveness , by measuring task performance or work satisfaction ( Fjermestad & Hiltz , 1998 , 2000 ; Ripoll , González - Navarro , Zornonza Abad , & Orengo , 2004 ) . In this line , there is some empirical evidence that the communication media has a direct effect on work affective out - comes . For example , Furumo and Pearson ( 2006 ) found that groups working with low ﬁdelity CMC report lower levels of work process , result satisfaction and group cohesion compared to groups work - ing face - to - face . 1 . 2 . Loaﬁng in the digital era Working in groups may have many beneﬁts ( see West , Brodbeck , & Richter , 2004 ) yet group also suffer from a number of problems , such as coordination deﬁciencies or motivational losses , which negatively affects their performance and affective work out - comes ( Allen & Hecht , 2004 ; LePine , Piccolo , Jackson , Mathieu , & Saul , 2008 ) . For example , social loaﬁng ( the tendency to withhold effort when working in a group ) was found in a variety of tasks such as brainstorming , shouting , or rope pulling ; and meta - analy - ses have conﬁrmed that social loaﬁng is a widespread phenome - non which not only affects performance but affective outcomes as well ( see Karau & Williams , 1993 ) . Empirical research suggests that individuals tend to loaf when they feel anonymous ( either due to larger group size or because they perceive that their contri - butions are not salient ) or when they perceive their co - workers to loaf ( Kidwell & Bennett , 1993 ; George , 1992 ; Huguet , Charbonnier , & Monteil , 1999 ; Kerr , 1983 ) . Hence , in line with this previous group research we expect perceived co - worker loaﬁng to nega - tively predict affective outcomes , such as work satisfaction or group cohesion , which leads us to our ﬁrst hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 . Perceived loaﬁng will negatively predict group cohesion , and the group’s work process and results satisfaction . In this study , we advance loaﬁng research by suggesting that perceived loaﬁng would have a more negative effect over these three affective outcomes in low ﬁdelity CMC than in traditional face - to - face workgroups . From a media richness perspective , in CMC teams working through a low ﬁdelity communication media ( e . g . instant messaging ) , there are many constraints that limit our ability to effectively monitor co - worker’s loaﬁng . For example , because these work - groups have at least some degree of geograph - ical dispersion , monitoring co - workers’ actual behaviors through direct observation is impractical , or not even possible in most cases . Therefore , ‘‘perceptions’’ of co - worker loaﬁng are in fact atti - tudes towards co - worker’s contributions and loaﬁng . Furthermore , because of the decrease in low ﬁdelity CMC workgroups , determin - ing the extent of actual co - worker loaﬁng is more difﬁcult to mea - sure ( or determine or discern ) than it is in face - to - face teams , and so is the damage that it generates in the group’s task accomplish - ment . This uncertainty , on the other hand , should strengthen the collective belief that the group could have achieved an output of higher quality if all members of the group had exerted equal effort . Consequently , if members perceive co - workers to loaf , their satis - faction with both the work process and outcomes should be lower in this type of CMC workgroups than in face - to - face workgroups . On the other hand , drawing from SIDE theory , we propose that in low ﬁdelity CMC workgroups , task - related variables will be more important for constructing a group identity than similarity or interpersonal attraction , ‘‘because these factors are less salient in groups which do not interact in person’’ ( González , Burke , Santuzzi , & Bradley , 2003 , p . 632 ) . For example , an experimental study found that computer mediated groups focused more on task - related concerns than face - to - face groups , and allocated less time to establish bonds between members ( Zornoza et al . , 2002 ) . Hence , for these workgroups , any behavior that harms the chances of performing effectively should be perceived as a more severe transgression of the group norms than in face - to - face teams . Loaﬁng behaviors not only threaten the group’s task accomplishment and affective outcomes ( such as satisfaction with the work process and its results ) but also their collective identity , and in turn the stability and continuance of the group as whole . The latter seems especially true when organizations use CMC to perform a speciﬁc task or solve a certain problem . For these groups , the task at hand does not only deﬁne their mission but also , to some extent , their 280 L . Monzani et al . / Computers in Human Behavior 33 ( 2014 ) 279 – 285 identity as a collective ( e . g . a problem - solving task force team ) . In other words , if co - workers perceive other members as ‘‘not pulling their weight’’ they should be more reluctant to continue belonging to the same workgroup ( Comer , 1995 ) or working with the same people in CMC teams in the future than in face - to - face groups . This leads us to the following hypothesis : Hypothesis 2 . The communication media will moderate the relation between perceived loaﬁng and work results satisfaction , cohesion and work process satisfaction . More speciﬁcally , we expect that perceived loaﬁng would more negatively inﬂuence group affective outcomes in low ﬁdelity computer - mediated communication workgroups as compared to face - to - face groups . In order to test this hypothesis , and as part of a larger project , we conducted a four - wave study measuring perceived loaﬁng , group cohesion , satisfaction with the work process and results in teams’ that worked via a low ﬁdelity communication media ( instant messaging ) , using face - to - face workgroups as reference group . Our rationale for choosing this type of CMC was that , even nowa - days , instant messaging is still probably the most frequently used type of communication media for virtual work in organizations ( especially for SME , and project teams that cannot afford richer types of communication media ) . 2 . Method 2 . 1 . Participants 176 students enrolled in an organizational psychology course were placed in 44 groups of 4 members each . Participation was voluntary as one way of satisfying part of the course requirement ( participants could also choose alternatives such as performing other class - related exercises ) . Average age was 22 . 97 ( SD = 4 . 65 ) ; 82 % were female . 2 . 2 . Design and procedure All participants were randomly assigned to a workgroup and all groups were randomly assigned to either a face - to face ( F - t - F ) or low ﬁdelity CMC condition ( text - based instant messaging ) . As a re - sult , 22 groups worked in an F - t - F environment , and 22 groups worked in a low ﬁdelity CMC environment . All groups met weekly in four sessions over a one - month period . In the four sessions , each group worked on a project , which consisted in the creation of a human resources consulting company . In each session of about one hour , group members were required to accomplish speciﬁc objectives related to the general objective of the project . In the ﬁrst session , each group had to generate a maximum of 12 products or services for a human resources company portfolio . In the second session , each group was required to carry out a stra - tegic analysis of its strengths , weaknesses , opportunities and threats ( SWOT technique ; Porter , 1991 ) . In the third session , each group had to make decisions in order to identify four key products to which their company would give priority . In the fourth session , group members had to reach consensus on the design and resource allocation of the company . At the end of each session , the experi - menter administered post - session questionnaires . Participants in the F - t - F condition were seated around a table , while participants in CMC condition were separated and placed at individual computer workstations . Participants in low ﬁdelity CMC condition were instructed to interact with each other only through the computer during the work session . The software used to support the group discussion was NetMeeting for XP Windows , and emulated a private chat room , where participants could enter a pseudonym or display a user number . The software kept a log of what each participant’s typed - in , it scrolled down as new messages where entered , yet previous messages were available to all group members . 2 . 3 . Measures All items were provided with 5 - point answering scales with endpoints 1 = ‘‘not at all’’ to 5 = ‘‘a lot’’ . Perceived loaﬁng : We used the scale of Mulvey and Klein ( 1998 ) to measure perceived co - worker loaﬁng . This scale asks partici - pants to indicate their agreement with four statements about their group using a ﬁve - point Likert scale ( sample items : ‘‘Members of my group are contributing less than I anticipated’’ , ‘‘Members of my group are trying as hard as they can’’ ) . Cronbach’s alpha in ses - sion 1 was 0 . 63 and at session 4 was 0 . 80 . The inter - rater reliability using the Lindell coefﬁcient at session 1 was 0 . 85 , and at session 4 was . 89 . Work results satisfaction : was measured by four items taken from Kuhn and Poole’s ( 2000 ) Group Reaction Questionnaire ( GRQ ) . Sample items are : ‘‘The group did very good work during this meeting’’ and ‘‘Overall , I was satisﬁed with the meeting today’’ . Cronbach´s alpha was 0 . 88 for session 1 and . 90 for session 4 . The average inter - rater reliability ( Lindell , 2001 ) at session 1 was 0 . 83 , and at session 4 it was 0 . 84 . Work Process satisfaction : was measured using ﬁve items taken from the work process satisfaction scale developed by Chidambaram and Jones ( 1993 ) . Sample items are : ‘‘The group carefully consid - ered whether each alternative idea would make for a better quality decision’’ , ‘‘The group carefully checked the validity of members’ opinions and assumptions’’ . Cronbach’s alpha was . 78 for session 1 and . 74 for session 4 . The average inter - rater reliability ( Lindell , 2001 ) was 0 . 88 for session 1 and 0 . 89 for session 4 . Group Cohesiveness : was measured by three items : ‘‘To what ex - tend do you feel members of your group have been distant ? ’’ , ‘‘To what extend do you feel your group has been a cohesive group ? ’’ and ‘‘To what extend do you feel your group has acted as a team ? ’’ The two ﬁrst items were developed for the purpose of this study ; the latter item was taken from the group identiﬁcation index ( Hogg & Hains , 1998 ) . Cronbach’s alpha was 0 . 66 for session 1 and 0 . 79 for session 4 . The average inter - rater reliability ( Lindell , 2001 ) was at session 1 0 . 84 , and at session 4 was 0 . 85 . 2 . 4 . Data analysis procedure To test our hypotheses , moderated regression analysis was used ( Cohen & Cohen , 1983 ) . To strengthen the argument that predictor variables play a causal role in relation to changes in cohesion , work process and results satisfaction , the scores at time 1 were entered in the ﬁrst step , controlling for initial levels of all measured vari - ables . We also entered perceptions of co - worker loaﬁng at time 1 , on the rationale that some individuals may have pre - conceived idea of their co - workers’ loaﬁng . In step 2 , the predictor variable , perceived loaﬁng , measured at time 4 , was entered together with the communication media variable ( 0 for CMC , 1 for F - t - F ) . In step 3 , the interaction term was included . As suggested by Aiken and West ( 1991 ) we centered all predictor variables . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Hypotheses testing Table 1 provides means , standards deviations and Pearson’s cor - relations for all continuous variables , while Table 2 shows F - test values for means between communication media conditions . In L . Monzani et al . / Computers in Human Behavior 33 ( 2014 ) 279 – 285 281 the face - to - face condition , means for work process ( F ( 1 , 42 ) = 6 . 90 p . < . 05 ) and results satisfaction ( F ( 1 , 42 ) = 11 . 56 p . < . 001 ) were signiﬁcantly higher than in the low ﬁdelity CMC condition , but no signiﬁcant differences were found for group cohesion . Perceived loaﬁng was negatively related to our three dependent variables at session 1 ( r = (cid:2) . 42 p < . 001 , for work cohesion ; r = (cid:2) . 56 p < . 001 for work process satisfaction and r = (cid:2) . 53 p < . 001 for work results satisfaction ) . The same occurred at session 4 ( r = (cid:2) . 78 p < . 001 for cohesion , r = (cid:2) . 74 p < . 001 for work process satisfaction and r = (cid:2) . 70 p < . 001 for work results satisfaction ) . The results of our MRA shows a negative direct effect of perceived loaﬁng on group cohesion ( Table 3 , b = (cid:2) . 75 ; p < . 001 ) , work process satisfaction ( Table 3 , b = (cid:2) . 83 ; p < . 001 ) and work results satisfaction ( Table 3 , b = (cid:2) . 93 ; p < . 001 ) at work session 4 , fully supporting our Hypothesis 1 . Table 3 shows that the interaction terms between the communi - cation media and perceived loaﬁng were signiﬁcant for cohesion ( Table 2 , b = . 22 ; p < . 05 ) , work process satisfaction ( Table 3 , b = . 20 ; p < . 05 ) , and marginally signiﬁcant for work results satisfac - tion ( Table 4 , b = . 24 ; p < . 09 ) . A signiﬁcance level of p < . 10 has been suggested by several researchers ( Caplan & Jones , 1975 ; Champoux & Peters , 1987 ; Rodriguez - Molina , Bravo , Peiró , & Schaufeli , 2001 ) to protect the test from the probability of committing Type II errors . Therefore , we will proceed interpreting also the marginal relation between perceived loaﬁng and work results satisfaction . More speciﬁcally , we conducted simple slope analyses following Aiken and West ( 1991 ) . Simple slopes of the communication media were tested for low ( (cid:2) 1 SD below the mean ) , and high ( + 1 SD above the mean ) levels of perceived loaﬁng for each of the dimensions of group effectiveness . As expected , slopes for groups working under different communi - cation media showed signiﬁcant differences for all our dependant variables . For group cohesion ( see Fig . 1 ) , simple slope tests revealed that perceived loaﬁng was more strongly related to group cohesion for the CMC groups ( b = (cid:2) 1 . 27 , t ( 2 , 38 ) = (cid:2) 6 . 16 , p < . 001 ) , compared to those who worked in a face - to - face environ - ment ( b = (cid:2) 0 . 64 , t ( 2 , 38 ) = (cid:2) 2 . 81 , p < . 01 ) . The same pattern emerged for work process satisfaction ( see Fig . 2 ) , where the slope gradient for computer mediated communication ( b = (cid:2) 0 . 98 , t ( 2 , 38 ) = (cid:2) 5 . 74 , p < . 001 ) was steeper than for face - to - face work ( b = (cid:2) 0 . 45 , t ( 2 , 38 ) = (cid:2) 2 . 64 , p < . 01 ) . Finally , slopes for work results satisfaction ( see Fig . 3 ) , also followed a similar pattern . Again , the Table 1 Means , standard deviations and correlations of continuous variables .

Taken together , these results support Hypothesis 2 . 4 . Discussion Research on virtual work suggests that when groups need to work through a low ﬁdelity communication media ( e . g . text - based ) , the negative effect of group losses over affective outcomes is stronger than in face - to - face groups . On this rationale , we conducted this study with the objective of evaluating if the type of communication media would moderate the negative relation between perceived loaﬁng and group affective outcomes ( more especially group cohesion , work process and results satisfaction ) . More speciﬁcally , we predicted that ﬁrst , as literature on loaﬁng suggests , perceived loaﬁng would negatively inﬂuence group cohe - sion , work results satisfaction and work process satisfaction ( Hypothesis 1 ) . Second , that the communication media type would moderate the relation between perceived loaﬁng these three affec - tive variables , in such way that the negative effect of perceive loaf - ing should become stronger for low ﬁdelity computer mediated work ( text - based ) . Our results fully supported our Hypothesis 1 and 2 , making a case for the importance of considering both tech - nological and social dimensions of virtual work , when addressing group motivational losses . Some theoretical and practical implications derive from our results . 4 . 1 . Theoretical implications Our results clearly show that low ﬁdelity CMC’s strengthens the negative effect of perceived loaﬁng on cohesion , satisfaction with the work processes and results . We discuss this ﬁnding from both technological and social - based approach . Drawing from media - richness theory , a possible explanation for this fact is that in face - to - face groups , member similarity and interpersonal attraction may serve as substitutes to rational accounts for loaﬁng behaviors . For example , a loafer could abuse his or her natural charm , to justify ‘‘getting ahead’’ with free - riding behaviors , as their fellow co - workers accept his or her explanation for this type of withdrawal behavior and social compensate for his or her input shortcomings . We suggested that as media richness decreases , the possible substitute effect of charm or physical attractiveness should be ‘‘ﬁltered out’’ by low ﬁdelity CMC . On the other hand , drawing from SIDE theory we proposed that CMC groups should have stronger task - based orientation and shared identity , on the rationale that , especially for ad hoc groups , their shared task is what deﬁnes the group’s reason of being , and should be a strong building block of their collective identity . Because co - worker loaﬁng interferes with the ability to perform effectively , it does not only threatens the group’s effectiveness but also its identity , and it seems plausible that loaﬁng behaviors in CMC workgroups are perceived as a more serious offense to the group stability and future viability . In consequence , group’s affective outcomes such as cohesion and satisfaction suffer more in CMC workgroups than in face - to - face groups when members perceive others to loaf . 4 . 2 . Practical implications and recommendations for management Social loaﬁng is a veiled threat to the sustainability of effective workgroups . As a double - edged sword , it cuts on two sides . On the one hand , if loafers manage to free ride undetected , task demands will increase for their co - workers . As less people need to do more , the probability of achieving their group goals will decrease . Increased demands and reduced resources may lead to higher negative emotional states , higher distress and a shift from task to personal conﬂict within the group , increasing member rotation and eventually endangering the group viability . On the other hand , if the veil is lifted and loaﬁng is perceived , the remaining group members may take different courses of action . Ideally , in order to Fig . 1 .

Monzani et al . / Computers in Human Behavior 33 ( 2014 ) 279 – 285 283 restore equity , they will require accounts for the loafer’s behaviors . Depending on his or her rationale , group members may accept loaﬁng as a lack of skill and compensate for the loafer shortcom - ings ( Tata , 2002 ) . However , if they do not believe or agree with the loafer’s rationale , they will respond by reducing their own effort ( Kerr , 1983 ) . Management can take different approaches to reduce loaﬁng in workgroups as research has provided evidence that social loaﬁng can be avoided under certain conditions . For example , the Köhler Motivation Gain ( understood as an increase in an individual’s per - formance because they feel to be the ‘‘weak link’’ in a group ) has been found for individuals who perceive their performance as indispensable to the workgroup ( e . g . , Kerr , Forlenza , Irwin , & Feltz , in press ) . Also , group members who feel a strong sense of belong - ing to their collective ( e . g . team , organization ) display less social loaﬁng ( e . g . , Van Dick , Stellmacher , Wagner , Lemmer , & Tissington , 2009 ) and sometimes even outperform nominal groups , an effect that has been labeled social laboring ( see Van Dick , Tissington , & Hertel , 2009 ) . Some studies show reduced social loaﬁng in collec - tivistic societies ( Earley , 1989 ; Wagner , 1995 ) or within highly cohesive teams ( Karau & Williams , 1993 ) . In consequence , independently of the type of communication media used , team - leaders could systematically foster an awareness of co - workers contributions by providing their work - group mem - bers , objective information of individual contributions to the collec - tive task , in order to trigger both social laboring and the Köhler effect . For this , designing clear and transparent work processes should help to better identify co - workers individual contributions . In computer - mediated workgroups , management could beneﬁt fromrecent developments in on - line collaborative software to orga - nize and clearly specify expected inputs from each member , making them publicly available to the whole workgroup . In this line , goal - setting theory has consistently found that setting difﬁcult and speciﬁc goals for each member and the group as a whole has strong positive effects on motivation and may even cancel the negative effect of social loaﬁng ( Wegge & Haslam , 2005 ; Wegge et al . , 2007 ) . This practice should also help to counter these motivational losses , even when work is computer - mediated or when contribu - tions to the common goal are voluntary ( Beenen et al . , 2004 ) . Organizations implementing CMC workgroups ( especially those with low ﬁdelity media ) could also beneﬁt from organizing at least one face - to - face introductory ‘‘launch’’ meeting in which group members ‘‘can put a real face to the user name’’ . Some researchers suggest that this helps to compensate the tendency to focus in task concerns and create a sense of group identity ( Hertel et al . , 2005 ; Karau & Williams , 1997 ) , which in turn is the ‘‘social glue’’ which bonds groups into effective teams . Furthermore , training in virtual teamwork could complement initial face - to - face meetings . Some studies show that virtual team training may trigger team learning and adaptation , relational development and feelings of connected - ness ( Powell et al . , 2004 ) . Ideally , the costs for these meetings would deliver a return in investment in form of higher group effec - tiveness . These recommendations are currently common practices in knowledge management teams and in open - source online commu - nities ( Andriessen , 2006 ) but may extended to other types of teams . 4 . 3 . Limitations and directions for future research While we made consistent efforts to ensure the validity of this study and its conclusions , it is not without limitations . First , follow - ing the tradition in experimental studies , we used ad hoc groups of undergraduate students as participants , working for a four - week period , using only two types of communication media , located at both ends of the media richness continuum ( Lira , Ripoll , Peiró , & Orengo , 2008 ) . In consequence , future research should attempt to replicate our ﬁndings using organizational settings with real teams , and ideally over a longer period . In this line of thought , future stud - ies could aim to expand our results using other types of communi - cation media such as videoconferences . Because this study was framed in a larger research project , some measurement issues such as measuring loaﬁng through a perception variable was unavoidable . Ideally , an objective measure of group workers loaﬁng could be used to control for possible bias in their perception of co - worker loaﬁng . Future studies may address this issue by using multiple measures of social loaﬁng to better evaluate if the moderator effect of communication media over group effectiveness . Finally , although our study is longitudinal , the predicted causal effect of perceived loaﬁng on team effectiveness is just an infer - ence . We did only manipulate the communication type but not loaﬁng itself . Therefore , a path in the opposite direction from group cohesion on loaﬁng might also be true . It is likely that both paths exist in parallel – this can also be concluded from looking at the simple correlations in our study . Perceived loaﬁng at time 1 and cohesion at time 4 correlate ( r = (cid:2) . 62 ) , but so do cohesion at time 1 and perceived loaﬁng at time 4 ( r = (cid:2) . 42 ) . Although the ﬁrst correlation is stronger and thus supports the predicted causality , the opposite effect cannot be ruled out . Social loaﬁng promotes a cycle of inefﬁciency that creates con - siderable costs to the organization . Some negative economic conse - quences of social loaﬁng are costs related to the failure to reach organizational goals , increased personal conﬂict in work - teams and member turnover , which indirectly implies higher recruiting , training and on - boarding costs . It seems clear then , that further identifying causes or testing effective counter - measures for social loaﬁng is clearly in the best interest of successful organizations . We hope that our study has contributed to the understanding of these effects .
