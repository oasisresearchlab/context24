Covid - 19 cases and 29 their contacts were identified through the local epidemiological surveillance system . VL , estimated by 30 quantitative PCR , was assessed at enrollment , at day 14 , and whenever the participant reported Covid - 19 - 31 like symptoms . Risk of transmission , risk of developing symptomatic disease and incubation dynamics 32 were evaluated using random - effects regression analysis . 33 Findings 34 We identified 314 cases , 282 of which had at least one contact ( 753 contacts in total ) . Ninety ( 33 % ) of 282 35 clusters had at least one transmission event . The secondary attack rate was 16 % ( 125 / 753 ) , with a variation 36 from 12 % to 24 % for VL of the index case of < 10 6 , and > 10 9 copies / mL , respectively ( OR per log 10 increase 37 in VL 1 . 3 95 % CI 1 . 1 – 1 . 6 ) . Increased risk of transmission was also associated with household contact ( OR 38 2 . 7 ; 1 . 4 – 5 . 06 ) and age of the contact ( OR 1 . 02 ; 1 . 01 – 1 . 04 ) . The proportion of PCR positive contacts who 39 developed symptomatic Covid - 19 was 40 . 3 % ( 181 / 449 ) , with a variation from 25 % to 60 % for VL of the 40 contact < 10 7 , and > 10 9 copies / mL ( HR log 10 increase in VL 1 . 12 ; 95 % CI 1 . 05 – 1 . 2 ) . Time to onset of 41 symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days ( IQR 5 – 10 ) for individuals with an initial viral 42 load < 10 7 to 6 days ( 4 – 8 ) and 5 days ( 3 – 8 ) for individuals with an initial viral load of 10 7 – 10 9 and > 10 9 , 43 respectively . 44 Interpretation 45 We show that the viral load of the index case is a leading driver of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . The risk of 46 symptomatic Covid - 19 is strongly associated with viral load of the contact at baseline , which shortens the 47 incubation time in a dose - dependent manner . 48 49 Funding : Crowdfunding campaign YoMeCorono ( https : / / www . yomecorono . com / ) , and Generalitat de 50 Catalunya . 51 52 .

Search terms included “Covid - 19” , “transmission” , 56 “incubation time” , and “risk” , with no language restrictions . By the time of performing this search , various 57 authors had reported on retrospective analyses of clusters of index cases and their corresponding contacts , 58 as well as series of patients who developed symptomatic Covid - 19 disease after PCR positive result . 59 Besides describing the secondary attack rate , various authors identified risk factors for transmission 60 associated with the place and duration of exposure and the lack of use of personal protective equipment . 61 However , we found no clear evidence regarding the influence of the characteristics of the index case on 62 transmission risk . Similarly , although various retrospective series of patients with positive PCR results had 63 reported incubation times elsewhere , the characteristics of index case and contacts that may influence the 64 risk of developing symptomatic Covid - 19 and the time to this event had been barely addressed . 65 Added value of this study 66 We analyzed data from a large cluster - randomized clinical trial on post - exposure therapy for Covid - 19 that 67 provide new information on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission dynamics . Several design components add value 68 to this dataset . Notably , quantitative PCR was available for the index cases to estimate risk of transmission . 69 Furthermore , quantitative PCR was also performed on asymptomatic contacts at the time of enrollment 70 allowing to investigate the dynamics of symptomatic disease onset among them . We found that the viral 71 load of the index case was the leading determinant of the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positivity among 72 contacts . Among contacts who were SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positive at baseline , viral load significantly 73 influenced the risk of developing the symptomatic disease in a dose - dependent manner . This influence also 74 became apparent in the incubation time , which shortened with increasing baseline viral loads . 75 Implication of all the available evidence 76 Our results provide important insights into the knowledge regarding the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission 77 and Covid - 19 development . The fact that the transmission risk is primarily driven by the viral load of index 78 cases , more than other factors such as their symptoms or age , suggests that all cases should be considered 79 potential transmitters irrespective of their presentation and encourages assessing viral load in cases with a 80 larger number of close contacts . Similarly , our results regarding the risk and expected time to developing 81 symptomatic Covid - 19 encourage risk stratification of newly diagnosed SARS - CoV - 2 infections based on 82 the initial viral load . 83 .

Currently available data provide information on the risk of 94 transmission related to the place and duration of exposure , and the use of respiratory and eye protection 1 , 3 – 95 5 , 8 but not on other factors related to the characteristics of index cases and their contacts . Over the course 96 of infection , the virus has been identified in respiratory tract specimens 1 – 2 days before the onset of 97 symptoms , and it can persist for up to 13 days after the onset of symptoms in mild cases . 9 However , the 98 detection of viral RNA by PCR does not necessarily equate with infectivity , and the exact relationship 99 between viral load and risk of transmission from a case is still not clear . 10 , 11 100 Another challenge for public health interventions is the risk stratification of infected individuals for 101 developing symptomatic illness . Studies investigating case - contact pairs have reported highly variable 102 secondary attack rates ( i . e . , range 0 . 7 % to 75 % ) , depending on the type of exposure―duration , place , pre - 103 or post - symptomatic . 12 – 15 On the other hand , the proportion of PCR - positive infected contacts that progress 104 to symptomatic disease has been typically around 40 % – 60 % . 16 Estimates of mean or median incubation 105 period have been consistently between 5 – 7 days . 17 – 19 Nonetheless , little is known about factors that may 106 contribute to variation on the risk of developing Covid - 19 symptoms or the incubation periods among 107 infected individuals . 108 The objective of this study was to evaluate transmission dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 in the context of a trial 109 of post - exposure prophylaxis and evaluate the influence of baseline variables―including viral load of the 110 index cases and exposed contacts―to transmission , development of symptomatic disease , and the 111 incubation period . 112 113 114 .

The study protocol of the BCN PEP CoV - 2 Study was approved by the ethics 121 committee of Hospital Germans Trias Pujol , ( Badalona , Spain ) . Written informed consent was obtained 122 from all participants . Full details of the original study are reported elsewhere . 20 123 Covid - 19 cases were identified using the electronic registry of the Epidemiological Surveillance Emergency 124 Service of Catalonia ( SUVEC ) of the Department of Health . 21 Following government ordinance , the 125 SUVEC registered all new Covid - 19 diagnoses occurred from March 16 , 2020 . The surveillance system 126 included active tracing of all contacts with recent history of exposure , defined as being in contact with a 127 SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positive case during more than 15 minutes within two meters . 128 All Covid - 19 cases included in the present analysis were non - hospitalized adults ( i . e . , ≥ 18 years of age ) 129 with quantitative PCR result available at baseline , mild symptom onset within five days before enrollment , 130 and no evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in their accommodation ( i . e . , household or nursing home ) or 131 workplace within the 14 days before enrollment . Contacts selected for the analysis were adults with a recent 132 history of exposure and absence of Covid - 19 - like symptoms within the seven days preceding enrolment . 133 Contacts were exposed to the index case as either a healthcare worker , a household contact , a nursing home 134 worker , or a nursing home resident . 135 Study procedures and data collection 136 A dedicated outbreak field team visited cases and contacts at home or nursing home on days 1 ( enrollment ) 137 and 14 . At the first clinical assessment on day 1 they conducted a baseline assessment , including a 138 questionnaire for symptoms of Covid - 19 and collected relevant epidemiological information using a 139 structured interview : time of first exposure to the index case , place of contact ( hospital , home , nursing care 140 facility ) , routine use of a mask of both , the case and the contact , and sleep location concerning the index 141 case ( e . g . , same room , same house ) . Symptoms surveillance consisted of active monitoring by phone on 142 days 3 , and 7 , a home visit on day 14 , and passive monitoring whenever the participants developed 143 symptoms . Participants who developed symptoms were visited the same day they notified symptom onset 144 .

The detection of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus was performed from nasopharyngeal swabs at 149 SYNLAB Diagnostics ( Barcelona , Spain ) by PCR using TaqMan™ 2019 - nCoV Assay Kit according to the 150 manufacturer’s protocol ( Catalog number : A47532 , Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc . ) . Viral load was 151 quantified from nasopharyngeal swabs at IrsiCaixa laboratory ( Badalona , Spain ) by PCR amplification , 152 based on the 2019 - Novel Coronavirus Real - Time RT - PCR Diagnostic Panel guidelines and protocol 153 developed by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . 22 For absolute 154 quantification , a standard curve was built using 1 / 5 serial dilutions of a SARS - CoV2 plasmid ( 2019 - 155 nCoV _ N _ Positive Control , catalog no . 10006625 , 2x10 5 copies / μL , Integrated DNA Technologies ) and run 156 in parallel to all PCR determinations . 157 Outcomes and definitions 158 Transmission was characterized by examining the number of infected and uninfected individuals among 159 close contacts to an index case . We defined transmission events as PCR - positivity at any time point ( i . e . , 160 days 1 , 14 , or at any other unscheduled PCR testing when participants referred symptoms ) of a contact in 161 the same household or workplace within the 14 days following enrollment . Following the WHO guidelines , 162 we defined the secondary attack rate as the ratio of PCR - positive individuals among close contacts . 163 The exposure time was defined as the time from the earliest possible contact with the symptomatic index 164 case , based on individual contact investigation . The incubation period was defined as time from first 165 exposure to symptom onset , with later confirmation of infection by PCR . 23 166 Statistical Analysis 167 The relationship between clinical and demographic characteristics of cases and their viral load was assessed 168 using linear regression and included all Covid - 19 cases , regardless of the presence or not of close contacts . 169 The analysis regarding the determinants of transmission was performed using clusters of an index case ( i . e . , 170 a Covid - 19 case with at least one close contact ) and their corresponding contacts . To identify risk factors 171 for transmission , we fitted a random - effects logistic regression model for the risk of transmission within a 172 cluster . Factors with potential influence on the risk of transmission included characteristics of the potential 173 transmitter ( i . e . , age , sex , viral load , and the presence or absence of respiratory symptoms ) and contacts 174 ( i . e . , age , sex , and the type of contact they had with the index case ) . Finally , the analysis regarding the risk 175 .

We assessed the time from exposure to 177 development of symptomatic disease and fitted a cox - regression model to explore the factors that may 178 influence it . Data at 14 days after the first study visit were censored , in line with the follow - up conducted 179 in the original trial . All analyses were conducted in R version 4 . 0 . 180 Role of the funding source 181 The funder of the study had no role in the study design , data collection , data analysis , data interpretation , 182 or writing of the report . The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final 183 responsibility for the decision to submit for publication . 184 185 RESULTS 186 Population characteristics 187 During the investigation period , we identified 314 cases in whom the viral load was tested . Overall , 220 188 ( 70 . 0 % ) were female and the median age was 41 ( IQR 31 - 52 ) . Of them , 282 had at least one close contact , 189 resulting in the corresponding clusters , with a total of 753 contacts . Clusters had a median of 2 contacts 190 ( IQR 1 - 3 ) and a maximum of 19 contacts . Most index cases of the clusters were female ( n = 202 , 71 . 6 % ) , 191 with an average age of 42 years ( SD 13 years ) ( Table 1 ) . 192 Index case viral load 193 At the first study visit , the median viral load amongst Covid - 19 cases was 10 8 ( IQR 10 6 - 10 9 ) . In 194 multivariable linear regression the viral load amongst cases was higher in individuals who reported cough , 195 fever , or rhinitis ( Table 2 ) . There was no association between the age or sex of the Covid - 19 case nor the 196 presence of reported dyspnea or anosmia with viral load . 197 Cluster - level transmission 198 For our risk factor analysis on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission we used linked case and contact data of 282 199 clusters with 753 contacts . At the cluster level , 90 ( 33 . 3 % ) of the 282 clusters had at least one transmission 200 event , with a highly skewed distribution of the number of transmission events per cluster ( Figure 1A ) . A 201 total of 125 ( 16 . 6 % ) of 753 contacts had a PCR positive result over the study period . The proportion of 202 contacts who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 within a cluster ( secondary attack rate ) progressively 203 increased with the viral load of the index case : from 12 % where the index case had a viral load of < 10 6 204 copies / mL to 24 % where the index case had a viral load > 10 9 copies / mL ( Figure 1B ) . According to the 205 multivariate analysis , the viral load of the index case was strongly associated with the risk of onward 206 .

Ninety percent ( 114 / 125 ) of 207 transmission events had an index case viral load of 5 . 1 log 10 copies / ml or more , and 50 % ( 61 / 125 ) had a 208 viral load of 8 . 8 log 10 copies / ml or more . Other factors associated with an increased risk of transmission 209 were household contact ( OR 2 . 7 , 95 % 1 . 4 - 5 . 06 ) and age of the contact ( OR 1 . 02 , 95 % 1 . 01 - 1 . 04 ) . There 210 was no association of risk of transmission with reported mask usage by contacts , with the age or gender of 211 the index case nor with the presence of respiratory symptoms in the index case at the initial study visit 212 ( Table 3 ) . 213 We did not find any evidence of an association between the viral load of the index cases and the first viral 214 load of incident positive results amongst contacts ( p = 0 . 1 , Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Also , after excluding 215 contacts who were PCR positive at the first study visit , we found no association between the viral load of 216 the index case and the time to onset of incident SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( HR 1 . 01 95 % CI 0 . 83 - 1 . 23 ) . 217 Risk factor for Covid - 19 disease among PCR + contacts 218 Overall , 449 contacts had a positive PCR result at first visit regardless of availability on viral load data of 219 their index case ( n = 125 ) or not ( n = 324 ) . Twenty - eight ( 6 . 3 % ) of 449 contacts had symptoms at the first 220 visit and 181 ( 40 . 3 % ) developed symptomatic Covid - 19 within the follow - up period . The multivariable 221 cox - regression analysis , after adjusting for age and sex , revealed that increasing viral load levels of the 222 contact at day 1 were associated with an increased risk of developing symptomatic disease . The risk of 223 symptomatic disease was approximately 25 % amongst individuals with an initial viral load of < 10 7 224 copies / mL compared to a more than 60 % amongst those with an initial viral load of > 10 9 ( HR per log 10 225 increase in VL 1 . 12 ; 95 % CI 1 . 05 – 1 . 2 ; p = 0 . 0006 ) ( Figure 2A ) . There was no association between with 226 sex or age of individuals and the risk of developing symptomatic Covid - 19 . 227 The median time from exposure to symptom onset was 7 days ( IQR 5 – 9 ) . The time to onset of symptomatic 228 disease decreased from a median of 7 days ( IQR 5 – 10 ) for individuals with an initial viral load < 10 7 229 copies / mL to 6 days ( IQR 4 – 8 ) and 5 days ( IQR 3 – 8 ) for individuals with an initial viral load of 10 7 - 10 9 230 and > 10 9 copies / mL , respectively ( Figure 2B ) . Overall , 110 / 181 ( 60 . 8 % ) of participants became 231 symptomatic before day 8 , 45 / 181 ( 24 . 9 % ) between days 8 - 10 , and 22 / 181 ( 12 . 2 % ) between days 11 - 14 . 232 233 DISCUSSION 234 In our study , we found that increasing viral load values in nasopharyngeal swabs of Covid - 19 cases were 235 associated with the greatest risk of transmission measured by SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positivity among contacts 236 and also a higher risk of transmission in household environment compared to other indoor situations .

In our cohort , a high proportion ( 67 % ) of index cases did not cause secondary 242 infections . However , we identified 90 ( 33 % ) clusters with transmission events and the multivariate analysis 243 revealed that clusters centered on index cases with high viral load were significantly more likely to result 244 in transmission . Secondary attack rate was under 12 % when the index case viral load was < 10 6 copies / ml 245 compared to more than 20 % amongst clusters with the highest viral loads . In line with previous analyses of 246 case - contact clusters , 9 , 12 , 14 we also found that household exposure to an index case was associated with a 247 higher risk of transmission that other types of contact , presumably reflecting duration and proximity of 248 exposure . Age of the contact was also identified in our multivariate analysis as a significant―albeit 249 modest―determinant of transmission . This factor has shown uneven influence across results reported 250 elsewhere , but seems to play a secondary role among adults . 13 , 14 Finally , unlike previous analyses that 251 reported a relationship between coughing and transmission , 13 we did not find any association . This finding 252 suggests that the absence of cough does not preclude significant onward transmission , particularly if the 253 viral load is high . Taken together , our results indicate that the viral load , rather than symptoms , may be the 254 predominant driver of transmission . 255 Importantly , we report that high viral short after exposure in asymptomatic contacts was strongly associated 256 with the risk of developing symptomatic Covid - 19 disease . We found an approximately 25 % chance of 257 developing symptomatic disease amongst individuals with an initial viral load < 10 7 copies / mL compared 258 to a more than 60 % chance amongst individuals with a viral load > 10 9 . These data may provide rationale 259 for risk stratification for developing illness . Moreover , the initial viral load significantly shifted the 260 incubation time , which ranged from 5 days in participants with a high viral load to 7 days in participants 261 with a low viral load . Our study is the first analysis of prospective data that investigates the association 262 between initial viral load and the incubation time . 263 The study has several limitations . First , asymptomatic people were not enrolled as index cases , affecting 264 our ability to fully characterize all types of transmission chain . Second , we did not find any evidence of 265 decreased risk of transmission in individuals who reported mask use . While this finding collides with the 266 evidence reported elsewhere , 8 we did not have fine - grained data on type of mask ( surgical vs FFP2 ) , use of 267 other measures of PPE or other infection control practices , thus limiting our ability to make clear inferences 268 about the impact of PPE on transmission risk . Third , we used time to symptom onset ( with later 269 .

Nonetheless , 270 accurate calculation of the incubation period was feasible because of the prospective nature of the study , 271 accurate identification of exposure by face - to - face interview , and intensive active and passive monitoring 272 of exposed contacts . Also , we followed participants over 14 - day periods , thus incubation periods beyond 273 14 days may not have been detected . 274 In summary , our results provide evidence regarding the determinants of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , 275 particularly on the role of the viral load . The higher risk of transmission among individuals with higher 276 viral loads adds to current evidence and encourages assessing viral load in cases with a larger number of 277 close contacts . When a case with high viral load is identified , implementation of reinforced contact tracing 278 measures and quarantines , may be critical to reduce onward transmission .
