In this study , we reveal and analyze the hitherto implicit intellectual structure of this advanced and diverse research field using bibliometrical methods . On the basis of a systematic review of 900 scholarly articles published between 1946 and 2012 , we identify 55 topical clusters that delineate and weight the dominant associations with the term “transportation management” as either a specific or executive function at an operational , strategic , and normative level . Moreover , we identify two avenues for further research that warrant future transport - specific research and that might potentially yield findings that can be generalized beyond this industry context . Keywords Transportation management – Review – Intellectual structure – Bibliometrical analysis The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 3 © SBB Lab 1 Introduction “Transportation management” and “management of transportation” are keywords frequently featured , yet rarely comprehensively defined or explained in peer - reviewed publications in the transportation research domain . On the one hand , there might be a strong consensus among the relevant community of researchers about the essence of this concept ( Nag , Hambrick , & Chen , 2007 ) . However , on the other hand , they might never have explicitly considered how the associations they form between the content of their publications and “transportation management” create an implicit understanding of this concept as well as shape the intellectual structure of research associated with the management of transportation . From our reading of the literature , and as we will demonstrate with this study , the latter is the case . This development is not unique to transportation research . The evolution of research fields is subject to the social construction of academics that contribute to a respective field’s development ( Nag et al . , 2007 ) . As fields mature , boundaries and central definitions in social sciences shift . Research priorities change , knowledge accumulates , and new methodologies allow for novel insights which together refine our understanding of core concepts on the basis of a constant interaction between abstract ideas and the specific empirical cases studied ( Tsoukas , 2009 ) . As a result , this pattern of scientific progression mostly fails to produce ever more specific and consentient definitions of key terms . Instead , definitions are contested and abound ( e . g . , Nag et al . , 2007 ; Zott , Amit , & Massa , 2011 ) ; parallel progressions within research fields proliferate . However , on the positive side , the parallel progression is a reflection of researchers’ creativity as well as eager interest in the study of a particular research topic . Literature reviews have been established as central landmarks portraying the evolution of research fields , summarizing , structuring as well as interpreting a field’s main contributions and definitions , and frequently highlighting avenues for further research ( Furrer , Thomas , & Goussevskaia , 2007 ; Rorissa & Yuan , 2012 ) . However , in recent years , traditional review papers based on an interpretive coding have been criticized for portraying foremost the authors’ subjective sense - making ( e . g . , Ding , Chowdhury , & Foo , 2001 ; Ramos - Rodriguez & Rui - Navarro , 2004 ) . A number of authors have therefore turned to bibliometrical strategies to investigate and represent the intellectual structure of academic fields ( e . g . , Ding et al . , 2001 ; McCain , 1990 ; Nerur , Rasheed , & Natarajan , 2007 ; White , 2003 ) – particularly , in more mature fields with hundreds of publications establishing researchers’ core understanding of central concepts . In this study , we use bibliometrical methods to reveal and analyze the hitherto implicit intellectual structure of the advanced and diverse research field that is concerned with the management of transportation for the first time . On the basis of a systematic review of 900 scholarly articles published between 1946 and the end of 2012 , we identify 55 topical clusters that delineate and weight the dominant associations with the term “transportation management” represented in the analyzed body of knowledge . Moreover , based on recent developments in ( general ) management research , we identify white spots on the map which warrant future transport - specific research . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 4 © SBB Lab 2 Conceptual background The comprehensive review of journal articles , which the subsequent sections will detail , revealed that there have been no previous attempts to define the intellectual structure of research on transportation management . Moreover , there are only a very limited number of definitions that specify transportation management as a subject in its own right . These deliberate definitions serve as a point of reference to compare the implicit conceptual understanding to ( also termed “structural definition” ) , which researchers create when they associate their publications with transportation management . Bardi and colleagues ( 2006 ) as well as the Transportation Research Thesaurus ( TRT ) provide two comprehensive and exemplary definitions of transportation management : “The management of transportation is concerned with the overall purchase and control of this movement service [ i . e . , moving freight and passengers ] used by a firm in achieving its logistics objectives” ( Bardi et al . , 2006 , p . 4 ) . “The planning , direction , and control of the entire activity of a transportation supplier , including the formulation of objectives , policies , programs , and strategy and product development ; organizing and staffing to carry out plans ; supervising operations ; and controlling performance” ( TRB , 2014 ) . The two definitions posit that transportation management assumes a dual meaning : First , the management of a specific function concerned with physically moving freight and / or passengers between spatial locations in an economic system ( e . g . , national economy , inter - organizational network , organization ) to a certain end ( cf . Bardi et al . , 2006 ; Cowie & Ison , 2010 ) ; secondly and more broadly , an executive function ( Barnard , 1938 ) concerned with the management of an organization whose main purpose is to provide transportation services . In addition , both definitions seem to comprehend management as teleological activity ( Van de Ven & Poole , 1995 ) in Henri Fayol’s ( 1949 ) categories : “plan , organize , coordinate , command , and control” . However , while the second meaning spans the domains of normative , strategic , as well as operational management ( Bleicher , 1994 ) , transportation management as a specific function seems to focus predominantly on operational aspects in the above definitions . Judging on the basis of literature reviews from our sample , we , in general , expect operational themes to dominate the intellectual structure of transportation management , which self - reference transportation management as a subject . The sample at hand includes a total of 36 literature reviews . A considerable number of these reviews address sub - topics of supply chain management , which integrates the management of transportation from a mostly functional perspective : sustainability ( Aronsson & Brodin , 2006 ; Carter & Easton , 2011 ; Carter & Rogers , 2008 ; Sarkis , 2012 ) , international logistics ( Babbar & Prasad , 1998 ; Goetschalckx , Vidal , & Dogan , 2002 ) , human resources and knowledge management ( Cantor , 2008 ; Chow , Choy , & Lee , 2007 ; Defee & Fugate , 2010 ; Gravier & Farris , 2008 ; Keller & Ozment , 2009 ) , strategic issues such as collaboration , planning and product development ( Ellram , Tate , & Carter , 2007 ; Nair , 2005 ; Power , 2005 ; Simatupang & Sridharan , 2002 ; Thomas & Griffin , 1996 ; Yazdanparast , Manuj , & Swartz , 2010 ) , innovation and technology management ( Forman & Lippert , 2005 ; Grawe , 2009 ) as well as risk management ( Williams , Lueg , & LeMay , 2008 ) . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 5 © SBB Lab The remaining reviews also emphasize transportation as a specific function and mainly operational aspects , however , they consider these matters from multiple angles including those of regulators , transportation service operators , shippers , and transportation customers : intermodal freight transportation ( Bontekoning , Macharis , & Trip , 2004 ; Meixell & Norbis , 2008 ) , adoption of information and communication technology ( Perego , Perotti , & Mangiaracina , 2011 ) , behavioral aspects of parking policies ( Marsden , 2006 ) , means to influence choice of transportation mode ( Fujii & Taniguchi , 2006 ) , air transportation ( Ginieis , Sánchez - Rebull , & Campa - Planas , 2012 ) , fleet management ( Dejax & Crainic , 1987 ) , routing and scheduling ( Giaglis , Minis , Tatarakis , & Zeimpekis , 2004 ) , simulation and modelling ( Taylor , Eldabi , Riley , Paul , & Pidd , 2009 ) , and operations research ( Daniel , Diakoulaki , & Pappis , 1997 ; Luss & Rosenwein , 1997 ) . In the subsequent methodology section , we elaborate how we aim to differentiate the present understanding of transportation management as both a specific and broader executive function covering management at different levels ( i . e . , operational , strategic , and normative ) by identifying the intellectual structure of transportation management research . 3 Methodology 3 . 1 Research objective By means of a co - word analysis ( Ding et al . , 2001 ) , we reveal and analyze the implicit intellectual structure of the research field that is concerned with transportation management to three ends : First , we aim to identify the implicit structural definition of transportation management that researchers create with their publication whenever they associate the term “transportation management” with other keywords ( e . g . , supply chain management , routing , or crew scheduling ) . Secondly , we investigate dominant topical clusters in transportation management research to retrospectively understand what the dominant issues in transportation management research have been . Finally , we contribute an agenda of suggestions for further research based on transportation management research’s white spots with regard to the four key challenges of transportation management elaborated in the previous section . The methodological design to investigate these research objectives is based on two key assumptions : First , research fields are subject to social construction ( Astley , 1985 ; Gioia , 2003 ; Kuhn , 1962 ) . Communities of scholars engage in knowledge creation on a subject under study ( e . g . , “transportation management” ) whereby they develop and use a shared technical vocabulary and common identity ( Nag et al . , 2007 ) . While the shared language enables these communities to engage in social construction , the shared “word system” ( Astley , 1985 , p . 499 ) does neither imply a static consensus on nor an unambiguous understanding of key concepts . Despite the importance of a shared core of essential meaning to scientific communities ( Cole , 1983 ; Nag et al . , 2007 ) , social sciences fail to produce ever more specific and consistent definitions . Instead , our understanding of core concepts evolves on the basis of a constant interaction between abstract ideas and the specific empirical cases studied ( Tsoukas , 2009 ) . Moreover , connotations of key terms change as research priorities shift to accommodate new empirical phenomena , as The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 6 © SBB Lab knowledge accumulates , and as new methodologies allow for novel insights . The evolution of research fields and this pattern of knowledge creation result in parallel progressions , contested and blurry definitions , and complicate identifying dominant notions of particular fields ( Ghaziani & Ventresca , 2005 ; Nag et al . , 2007 ) . Secondly , it assumes that keywords adequately represent the content and main ideas of publications ( Ding et al . , 2001 ; Ghaziani & Ventresca , 2005 ) . These keywords are either defined by the authors of a publication and / or a literature database provider ( e . g . , Business Source Premier ) . Two ideas or themes are linked by a publication whenever two keywords co - occur ( Ding et al . , 2001 ; Ronda - Pupo & Guerras - Martin , 2012 ) – or for some cases even when keywords are co - absent ( Ronda - Pupo & Guerras - Martin , 2012 ) . Given scholarly conventions , norms , and academic incentive schemes , we maintain that academic authors optimize the keyword section of their publications to be found , read , and cited . In addition , we expect database providers to optimize the utility of selected keywords with reference to search queries in their database catalogues , indices , and via aggregator services . Finally , in defining keywords , both authors and databases adhere to the dual tendency to use familiar as well as unique terms . Familiar vocabulary associates a publication with the existing body of knowledge as well as the respective scientific community the paper is addressing . Unique terms , in contrast , signal a publication’s unique value and contribution . 3 . 2 Overview of the method This study of the literature associated with the keyword “transportation management” deploys a bibliometrical research design ( Pritchard , 1969 ) . Bibliometrical designs use a mostly quantitative approach “to uncover the essence of a research field” ( Samiee & Chabowski , 2012 , p . 367 ) based on the characteristics of written documents . Specifically , we use co - word analysis ( Bhattacharya & Basu , 1998 ; Wang , Li , Li , & Li , 2012 ) to identify the intellectual structure and conceptual space ( Ding et al . , 2001 ) of transportation management research . In essence , co - word analysis mathematically and statistically analyzes the co - occurrence patterns of keywords that appear in written documents ( e . g . , articles , reports , book chapters , etc . ) ( Samiee & Chabowski , 2012 ) . It thereby assumes that the main themes of any written publication can be adequately reduced to and inferred from a publication’s keywords ( Ding et al . , 2001 ; Wang et al . , 2012 ) . This assumption is reflected in the three analytical steps through which the co - word analysis proceeds : First , the researcher creates a co - occurrence matrix based on a set of relevant publications . This matrix identifies the topics linked to the research field and how these topics link to each other ( Ronda - Pupo & Guerras - Martin , 2012 ) . Second , cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling point to topical clusters ( i . e . , themes frequently researched together ) and allow to visualize the intellectual structure of the research field ( Ding et al . , 2001 ; McCain , 1990 ) . In the final step , the map of the intellectual structure and topical clusters needs to be interpreted on the basis of interpretive coding . Each step is detailed for this particular study in the subsequent sections . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 7 © SBB Lab As a bibliometrical research design , co - word analysis offers three distinct advantages 1 in assessing the intellectual structure of research fields : First , it is reproducible and believed to produce more objective results than some purely interpretive literature reviews because of its data - driven nature and quantification focus ( Nerur et al . , 2007 ; Samiee & Chabowski , 2012 ) . Secondly , it provides a systematic approach to mapping the conceptual space of research fields in terms of topical clusters and frequencies ( Ding et al . , 2001 ) . These maps seem more memorable than purely textual representations . However , while these maps’ frequencies and clusters can almost always be interpreted , the interpretation of distances between keywords is subject to limitations inherent in the heterogeneity and skewedness of the underlying data ( Hair , Black , Babin , & Anderson , 2010 ) . Finally , co - word analysis avoids a number of biases that its bibliometrical sibling co - citation analysis is subject to such as unequal weight attached to older versus more recent publications or trouble in identifying citation motives ( e . g . , critique , endorsement , establishing topical links , h - index , etc . ) ( Nerur et al . , 2007 ; Ramos - Rodriguez & Rui - Navarro , 2004 ) . 3 . 3 Identifying and sampling transportation management publications To identify publications relevant to transportation management , we ran a systematic search of the big five online literature databases ( i . e . , ISI Web of Knowledge , EBSCO , Science Direct , Emerald , and ProQuest ) with the keywords “Transportation Management” and “Management of Transportation” 2 for scholarly journal articles written in English and published until the end of December 2012 . Articles published in journals ranked “C” or higher in the “Excellence for Research in Australia ( ERA ) 2010” list were arranged in a comprehensive literature database and duplicates removed . Data was sorted and scanned for false positives ( i . e . , non - articles and articles whose content did not pertain to transportation management such as articles from medical journals pertaining to transportation of blood cells in the human body ) . In addition , we cleaned keywords for computational manipulation ( i . e . , hyphenation of compounds , expanded abbreviations ) ( Ding et al . , 2001 ; Samiee & Chabowski , 2012 ) . Table 1 summarizes these activities and how they affected the number of publications in the sample : In total , our set of relevant publication included 900 ranked , scholarly journals articles containing a total of 4 , 686 original keywords . 1 We discuss the inevitable limitations of our selected methodology in the final section . 2 The term “transport” was treated as a synonym of “transportation” and was included as a key word in the search . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 8 © SBB Lab Table 1 : Sample of transportation management publications number of publications in considered set Total search results 1 , 316 Removal of non - ranked publications ( - 231 ) 1 , 085 Removal of duplicates ( - 101 ) 984 Removal of false positives ( - 84 ) 900 Source : Own representation . The sampling strategy aims to get as close as possible to the total population of certified scholarly articles in the transportation management field ( Ramos - Rodriguez & Rui - Navarro , 2004 ) to maximize the representation adequacy of the intellectual structure . We therefore sampled inclusively rather than drawing an exclusive sample of a limited number of , for example , most cited articles in order to limit the subjectivity of publication coverage ( Samiee & Chabowski , 2012 ) . In doing so , the reliance on scholarly , peer - reviewed journals and on those publication outlets ranked “C” and higher serves as a minimum quality control and assumes that these English journals are an adequate reflection of the scientific discourse in the research field in question ( Ghaziani & Ventresca , 2005 ; Nag et al . , 2007 ) . 3 . 4 Step 1 : Building a dictionary of transportation management keywords Two coders independently created hierarchical dictionaries in WordStat 6 . 0 based on the set of original keywords from relevant publications . Following the vocabulary standardization advice by Ding and colleagues ( 2001 ) , synonymous and antonymous terms as well as broad and narrow terms referring to the same object were summarized in broader categories . Where a keyword’s meaning was ambiguous , coders referred back to abstracts and original publications to identify a keyword’s meaning in context . Each category ( termed “dictionary keyword” or DKW ) was named to represent either major entities or activities . Overall , coders followed a two - step , two - level approach to determine the final set of DKW : First , they compared the independently coded dictionaries and discussed differences in sorting ( i . e . , the associations created between original keywords and DKW ) as well as DKW naming . The resulting unified dictionary was subsequently scrutinized top - down and bottom - up . Bottom - up , the sorting of original keywords was reconsidered for every single DKW . Top - down , we compared the list of DKW with key terms and definitions from the strategic management domain ( i . e . , Academy of Management and Strategic Management Society ) and with the Transportation Research Thesaurus curated by the Transportation Research Board to limit the danger of idiosyncratic DKW labeling and address indexer effects ( Ding et al . , 2001 ) . This procedure resulted in 160 dictionary keywords . In total , the original keywords summarized under each DKW account for ≥5 publication occurrences . In addition , we created two residual DKW categories : a category labeled “residual” for all the leftover one - The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 9 © SBB Lab off keywords that did not fit any other category ( 2 . 9 percent of original keywords ) and a “delete” category for all the original keywords that referred to paper characteristics ( e . g . , research strategies , analytical procedures , and research discipline identifiers ) rather than a paper’s main themes ( 26 . 5 percent of original keywords ) . Finally , the 160 dictionary keywords were arranged in an occurrence matrix ( DKW x Publications ) that associates the set of relevant publications with the DKW based on the dictionary specified above . Two main reasons justify running co - word analysis on the basis of a dictionary of aggregated keyword categories ( i . e . , DKW ) rather than the original keywords themselves : First , original keywords pertaining to a single theme may feature different spellings , word forms , antonyms and synonyms ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) . Table 2 summarizes the totals for original keywords , words , word forms , and DKW . For example , about 73 percent of words featured in our sample occurred just in a single publication . Aggregating those original keywords that refer to a single theme in a DKW brings themes more clearly to the fore . Table 2 : Original keywords , words , word forms , and dictionary keywords # of words Total number of original keywords ( KW ) 4 , 686 words 2 , 268 word forms 460 dictionary keywords ( DKW ) 160 Note : Number of words and word forms indicated after exclusion processing ( e . g . , removing pronouns and conjunctions ) , lemmatization and spelling correction . Source : Own representation . Secondly , original keywords may be homonyms or ambiguous in their use ( Ding et al . , 2001 ; Wang et al . , 2012 ) . We were able to more clearly distinguish the underlying intellectual structure by sorting original keywords in clearly delineated DKW , which were based on the intended meaning of the original keyword as inferred from the context of the original publication . 3 . 5 Step 2 : MDS and cluster analysis WordStat 6 . 0’s clustering and multidimensional scaling routine provided a first descriptive indication of the data structure for the 900 publications and 160 DKW . The descriptive results are based on Jaccard’s coefficient for the binary input from the occurrence matrix ( Backhaus , Erichson , Plinke , & Weiber , 2006 ) and include all DKW with ≥5 publication occurrences . The MDS’s stress and R 2 values run for 60 different clustering solutions are both below acceptable values ( Backhaus et al . , 2006 ; Hair et al . , 2010 ) . The results indicate that the heterogeneity of the relevant set of publications will not allow interpreting the distance and dimension based on a two - dimensional MDS map ( McCain , 1990 ; Samiee & Chabowski , 2012 ) . Nonetheless , the graphical representation selected on the basis of the best clustering solution is helpful as it portrays the individual clusters and the respective frequencies of DKW within these . To determine the number of clusters in the final solution , we reran WordStat’s weighted average linkage clustering for Jaccard’s coefficient on the occurrence matrix ( DKW x The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 10 © SBB Lab Publications ) in Stata 11 . This agglomerative procedure is less susceptible to the influence of extreme values than comparative hierarchical clustering procedures and tends to produce solutions “with approximately equal within - group variance” ( Hair et al . , 2010 , p . 531 ) .

The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 11 © SBB Lab Across the two programs , the final cluster solution is stable at a level of 0 . 84 ( Hair et al . , 2010 ) . Given the heterogeneity of our input data and that the set of relevant publications represents a population of transportation management articles specified according to the above considerations rather than a subjective sample ( Samiee & Chabowski , 2012 ) , we referred to change in heterogeneity ( 1 - Jaccard ) as well as Caliński and Harabasz pseudo - F index to select the preliminary cluster solutions ( Caliński & Harabasz , 1974 ; Milligan & Cooper , 1985 ) . The four preliminary cluster solutions considered for the next step are marked in bold letters in Table 3 ( cf . p . 10 ) and share three common features : a 1 - similarity coefficient of ≤ 0 . 0121 ( i . e . , smaller than the one of the solution with the highest pseudo - F index ) , a decline in the coefficient as compare d to the previous solution of ≥ 90 percent , and a pseudo - F index of ≥1 . 28 . 3 . 6 Step 3 : Interpretive coding of cluster solutions Two coders independently interpreted and labeled the four preliminary cluster solutions : One started top - down with the solution that entailed the highest number of clusters ; the other , bottom up . Overall , the labels that coders attached to the DKW groups that had resulted from the clustering algorithm matched in 74 percent of the cases , which is acceptable given the exploratory nature of this study ( Lombard , Snyder ‐ Duch , & Bracken , 2002 ) . Differences were discussed and labels finally merged for cluster solution 55 , which proved the most meaningful to both coders ( Afifi , May , & Clark , 2012 ; Hair et al . , 2010 ) . To validate that the cluster labels attached adequately represented the underlying data , we finally screened the abstracts and titles of all papers associated with the 55 clusters that feature > 50 percent 3 of DKW associated with any given cluster . As papers are multifaceted in terms of their content and thus in the keywords that refer to their main themes , it is not surprising that many papers are associated with multiple clusters and do not perfectly fit any single one . Overall , we found the labels to adequately represent the papers that best fit each cluster . In sum , the three steps outlined above resulted in 55 topical clusters that represent the intellectual structure of the transportation management field and which we will analyze and discuss in the subsequent section . 3 We relaxed this condition for three clusters to ≥50 percent to include any paper whose abstract represented the cluster’s DKW . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 12 © SBB Lab 4 Analyses and results 4 . 1 Descriptive results The year - of - publication distribution of scholarly articles in the relevant set ranges from 1946 to 2012 . Only 84 publications ( i . e . , 9 . 3 percent ) were published in the first 50 years since 1946 . Since the mid - 1990s , however , the number of yearly publications has significantly increased with annually more than 50 new transportation management publications after 2005 and a noteworthy peak of 111 new articles in 2009 ( i . e . , 12 . 3 percent ) . Accordingly , the median publication year dates back to just 2007 . Figure 1 illustrates these trends . Figure 1 : Number of transportation management articles published annually Source : Own representation . Nearly half of all articles included ( i . e . , 47 . 2 percent ) were published in A - or A * - ranked publications according to the “Excellence for Research in Australia ( ERA ) 2010” list . B - ranked journals accounted for 29 . 2 percent and C - ranked for 23 . 6 percent of articles in the relevant set respectively ( cf .

Of the remainder , two journals are dedicated to policies and practices ( i . e . , “Transportation Research Part A : Policy and Practice” and “Transportation Policy” ) , four to operations research ( i . e . , “European Journal of Operational Research” , “Journal of the Operational Research Society” , “International Journal of Operations & Production Management” , and “Operations Research” ) , and four to information systems ( i . e . , “Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology” , “Interfaces” , “Industrial Management & Data Systems” , and “Management Science” ) . 85 340 263 212 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 A * A B C # o f pub li ca t i on s Journal ranking ( basis : ERA 2010 ) Distribution of publications by ranking ( n = 900 ) The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 14 © SBB Lab Table 4 : Journals with ≥ 10 publications Journal title # of publications % of total European Journal of Operational Research ( Category : Mathematical Sciences ) 84 9 . 3 International Journal of Physical Distribution & Logistics Management ( Category : Business and Management ) 78 8 . 7 Supply Chain Management : An International Journal ( Category : Business and Management ) 48 5 . 3 International Journal of Logistics Management , The ( Category : Business and Management ) 43 4 . 8 Transportation Research Part E : Logistics and Transportation Review ( Category : Transportation and Freight Services ) 36 4 . 0 Transportation Research Part A : Policy and Practice ( Category : Transportation and Freight Services ) 27 3 . 0 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology ( Category : Transportation and Freight Services ) 26 2 . 9 Interfaces ( Category : Information Systems ) 25 2 . 8 Journal of Transport Geography ( Category : Transportation and Freight Services ) 25 2 . 8 Transport Policy ( Category : Transportation and Freight Services ) 22 2 . 4 Journal of the Operational Research Society ( Category : Mathematical Sciences ) 19 2 . 1 International Journal of Operations & Production Management ( Category : Business and Management ) 18 2 . 0 Industrial Management & Data Systems ( Category : Computer Software ) 17 1 . 9 Management Science ( Category : Information Systems ) 16 1 . 8 Transportation Research Part B : Methodological ( Category : Transportation and Freight Services ) 16 1 . 8 Transportation Science ( Category : Transportation and Freight Services ) 16 1 . 8 Journal of Air Transport Management ( Category : Transportation and Freight Services ) 13 1 . 4 Transportation Research : Part C ( Category : Civil Engineering ) 13 1 . 4 Tourism Management ( Category : Tourism ) 12 1 . 3 Operations Research ( Category : Computation Theory and Mathematics ) 11 1 . 2 Journal of Business Logistics ( Category : Business and Management ) 10 1 . 1 Source : Own representation . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 15 © SBB Lab Overall , this distribution of articles across journals provides an indication that goods’ transportation , operational issues , and information and communication systems are likely to be dominant themes in the intellectual structure of transportation management . Table 5 provides an overview of dictionary keywords , number of publications , mean , mode , and standard deviation for the average year of publication for publications associated with every cluster . On average , clusters contain three dictionary keywords , with cluster 28 featuring the most , i . e . , 8 DKW , and clusters 53 and 15 being single DKW clusters . While cluster solutions are generally selected to avoid single clusters ( Hair et al . , 2010 ) , we tolerate them here in favor of interpretability across all clusters for the selected solution – not least because both single clusters represent independent themes .

Source : Own representation . On average , 16 publications are associated with every cluster ; however , associations vary between 9 publications for cluster 23 to 392 publications for cluster 20 . The mean age distribution of publications in clusters reflects the surge in new articles since the mid - 1990s . Cluster 49 aggregates the oldest publications with 2000 as average publication year and the highest standard deviation . Clusters 9 and 43 , in contrast , join the youngest The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 16 © SBB Lab publications from the relevant set , with average publication in 2009 and considerably lower standard deviations . Finally , Figure 3 ( cf . p . 17 ) illustrates the distribution of DKW across clusters weighted by the number of DKW occurrence ( i . e . , circle diameter ) for the identified 55 theme clusters based on WordStat6’s MDS routine . Despite the stress ( 0 . 446380 ) and R 2 value ( 0 . 0652 ) not reaching satisfactory levels ( McCain , 1990 ) , the graphical representation helpfully portrays the individual clusters and the respective frequencies of DKW within them . 4 . 2 Cluster labels Table 6 ( cf . p . 18 ) details the labels and definitions of all 55 clusters . To provide a structured overview of these clusters , we describe them in nine groups : The first group of clusters is universally concerned with moving freight and passengers , i . e . , the core of transportation management as a specific function . Clusters 51 ( “Freight transportation and handling” ) , 14 ( “Cargo - type - based contingencies” ) , 17 ( “Foreign trade of containerized freight” ) , 21 ( “Warehousing and transportation” ) , and 29 ( “Control of stock” ) address freight transport and storage in a range of different settings ( e . g . , Hafliðason , Ólafsdóttir , Bogason , & Stefánsson , 2012 ; Kleywegt & Papastavrou , 2001 ; Mason , Mauricio Ribera , Farris , & Kirk , 2003 ; Murty et al . , 2005 ; Thill & Lim , 2010 ) . Clusters 54 ( “Network design” ) , 32 ( “Infrastructure maintenance” ) , and 31 ( “Facility management” ) focus on the infrastructure and facilities that enable freight and passenger transportation ( e . g . , Durango - Cohen & Sarutipand , 2009 ; Ukkusuri & Patil , 2009 ; Ye & Yezer , 1992 ) . In contrast , the publications in the subsequent clusters ( e . g . , Andersen , Crainic , & Christiansen , 2009 ; Chu , Tsai , & Hu , 2012 ; Desrosiers , Lasry , McInnis , Solomon , & Soumis , 2000 ; Janson , Anderson , & Sterne , 1989 ; Jasen , 2005 ; Lee & Ueng , 1999 ; Smith , Sweeney , & Campbell , 2009 ; Zhan & Noon , 1998 ) are more preoccupied with the management of transportation’s dynamic aspects : 28 ( “Traffic management and engineering” ) , 26 ( “IT - based system management” ) , 27 ( “IT - enabled decision - making” ) , 19 ( “Routing and scheduling” ) , 45 ( “Time evaluation” ) , 52 ( “Vehicle - network co - optimization” ) , 53 ( “Fleet management” ) , and 18 ( “Water transportation” ) . Finally , cluster 33 ( “Transportation safety” ) comprises publications that deal with safety issues and practices ( e . g . , Grant & Rutner , 2004 ) .

Source : Own representation . The second group includes three clusters that address the regulatory and governance side of transportation systems that encompasses both normative and operational matters : Clusters 13 ( “Governance” ) , 5 ( “Regulation and regulator efficiency” ) , and 7 ( “Effective public funding” ) deal with issues such as the impact of transportation governance in society , the efficiency of government - sponsored public transportation or transportation policies , and the effects of public funding ( e . g . , Kim & Dickey , 2006 ; McKinnon , 2009 ; Pina & Torres , 2001 ; Sciara , 2012 ) . The subsequent third group of clusters deals with assessing and mitigating the negative external effects of transportation . Cluster 6 ( “ ( External ) Cost of motorized transportation” ) deals directly with issues like pollution and congestion ( e . g . , An , Hu , & Wang , 2011 ) , while clusters 9 ( “Green ( third party ) logistcs” ) , 47 ( “Green product lifecycle” ) , and 48 ( “Waste management” ) focus on optimizing logistics for environmental sustainability ( e . g . , Adamides , Mitropoulos , Giannikos , & Mitropoulos , 2009 ; Blengini , 2008 ; Perotti , Zorzini , Cagno , & Micheli , 2012 ) . Finally , cluster 10 ( “Socially sustainable transportation” ) is concerned with the welfare effects of transportation and the role of stakeholder involvement connected with sustainability issues ( e . g . , Gil , Calado , & Bentz , 2011 ) . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 22 © SBB Lab The fourth group of clusters relates to all the publications that investigate transportation as a function in manufacturing , production , and sales . The subject of publications associated with the following clusters is understanding and optimizing the practices of different supply chains in various industries and at different scales ( e . g . , Hsiao , Van Der Vorst , Kemp , & Omta , 2010 ; Liao , Marsillac , Johnson , & Liao , 2011 ; Randall , Gibson , Defee , & Williams , 2011 ; Sahin & Robinson Jr , 2005 ) : Clusters 20 ( “Supply chain management” ) , 16 ( “Network management ( in retailing ) ” ) , 38 ( “Global supply chains” ) , and 55 ( “Value chain structure” ) . In addition , clusters 35 ( “Business logistics” ) and 39 ( “JIT logistics” ) deal with the role of transportation operators’ services in business logistics – particularly for time - critical manufacturing processes ( e . g . , Nair , 2005 ; Neuschel , 1987 ; Wu , 2003 ) . Finally , cluster 41 ( “Operations management” ) deals with process optimization and the integration of transportation into manufacturing systems ( e . g . , Kumar & Petersen , 2006 ) . The fifth group of clusters takes a broader stance and refers to transportation management mostly as an executive function . It focuses on themes traditionally associated with management and business studies . Clusters 40 ( “Strategic Management” ) and 36 ( “Leadership ( in culturally diverse contexts ) ” ) address strategic management issues such as competitive advantage , strategic use of transportation resources , and the effect of leadership on transportation organizations and services in different cultural settings ( e . g . , Flint & Golicic , 2009 ; Hazen & Byrd , 2012 ; Hiller , Day , & Vance , 2006 ) . In contrast , clusters 34 ( “Risk management” ) and 11 ( “Human resource management” ) focus on operational support functions that cover risks in transportation organizations and supply chain management as well as determinants of employee satisfaction , performance , and tenure ( e . g . , Fielding , Lo , & Yang , 2010 ; Morrow , McElroy , & Scheibe , 2011 ; Suzuki , 2007 ) . Innovation , knowledge management , and the effects of technology on organizational behavior are of particular interest to publications ( e . g . , Carayannis , 1999 ; Grawe , 2009 ; Hazen & Byrd , 2012 ) linked to clusters 30 ( “Innovation” ) , 25 ( “Knowledge management” ) , and 12 ( “Technology and organizational behavior” ) . Finally , clusters 37 ( “Relationship management” ) and 43 ( “Collaboration and cooperation” ) center on determinants of success in alliances that involve transportation operators and explaining inter - firm relationships along the supply chains ( e . g . , Gunasekaran & Ngai , 2003 ; Noonan & Wallace , 2006 ; Vowles , 2000 ) . The sixth group includes two clusters that focus on transportation management’s link with performance outcomes . Clusters 8 ( “Performance and change management” ) and 23 ( “Service performance management” ) span publications that detail performance management techniques and performance measures for transportation services purchasing and operators as well as the antecedent effects of changes in industry contexts ( e . g . , Gillen & Lall , 1997 : Stefansson , 2008 # 3463 ; Holter , Grant , Ritchie , & Shaw , 2008 ) . The seventh group of clusters pertains to publications that relate to transportation’s aspects of marketing and consumer behavior . Clusters 2 ( “Consumer behavior” ) , 4 ( “Private sector transportation demand” ) , 3 ( “ ( Peak ) Demand management” ) , and 1 ( “Behavioral effects of pricing” ) deal with transportation demand patterns and demand management ( e . g . , Koppelman , Bhat , & Schofer , 1993 ; Mahmassani , 1999 ; Marsden , 2006 ; Pogue , 1997 ) . In addition , clusters 22 ( “Quality management ( in aviation ) ” ) , 42 ( “Customer service” ) , and 50 ( “Revenue management” ) cover service quality management for transportation services ( e . g . , Rhoades & Waguespack Jr , 2008 ) , the effects of different The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 23 © SBB Lab practices to improve transportation and related services on customer service perception ( e . g . , Bertini & Lovell , 2009 ) , and revenue management practices and systems ( e . g . , Kuhlmann , 2004 ) . The eighth group refers to two clusters that are preoccupied with the internet and e - commerce as dedicated influence and field of application . Publications aggregated in cluster 44 ( “Internet - enabled transactions” ) assess how the internet has changed the interaction of parties along the supply chain ( e . g . , Lancioni , Smith , & Oliva , 2000 ) . In contrast , cluster 46 ( “Electronic commerce & cargo tracking” ) is more preoccupied with the effects of electronic data interchange ( e . g . , RFID ) for e - commerce ( e . g . , Wamba , 2012 ) . The ninth and final cluster group includes three residual clusters : Cluster 15 ( “Application” ) is very generic and includes publications that describe and assess applications of concepts , systems , strategies , and practices ( e . g . , Bertini & Rufolo , 2004 ) . In contrast , clusters 24 ( “Energy efficiency of mode choice & tourism education” ) and 49 ( “Communication & Railroads” ) are both very specific and heterogeneous . Cluster 24 deals with energy efficiency of tourists’ transportation mode choices on the one hand , and practices in tourism education and training , on the other hand ( e . g . , Becken , Simmons , & Frampton , 2003 ; Stear & Griffin , 1993 ) . Finally , cluster 49 encompasses publications that try to understand transportation - related communication as well as rail - specific transportation issues ( e . g . , Galetzka , Gelders , Verckens , & Seydel , 2008 ; Luguang , 2006 ) . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 24 © SBB Lab 5 Discussion Based on the introductory discussion of transportation management as both a specific and executive function at different levels ( i . e . , normative , strategic , and operational ) , we assigned the 55 clusters to the six cells of the matrix displayed in Figure 4 . Fourteen clusters ( printed in italics ) fall into more than one cell as clusters are not perfectly homogeneous in terms of the two - by - three dimensions . Figure 4 : Distribution of clusters across management levels and functions Note : Italics indicate that cluster appears in more than one cell . Source : Own representation . Even upon visual inspection only , it is apparent that the intellectual structure of transportation management research is clearly dominated by themes that refer to transportation management as a specific function at an operational level . In total , 85 percent of clusters fall into this category – 35 out of 47 clusters are even solely in this cell ( i . e . , 63 percent of all clusters ) . The diversity of clusters and represented themes even within this single cell points to the underlying heterogeneity of papers in the relevant set . In addition , seven out of ten clusters ( i . e . , clusters 3 , 6 , 19 , 20 , 22 , 27 and 28 ) with the most associated papers ( i . e . , all ≥ 50 publications ) fall into this category . For six clusters ( i . e . , clusters 8 , 9 , 16 , 20 , 43 , and 44 ) , there is also a strategic component to the specific transportation issues addressed . Finally , normative management matters are of relevance to the three clusters that address regulatory matters ( i . e . , clusters 5 , 7 , 13 ) . However , only The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 25 © SBB Lab the “Governance” cluster is primarily focused on transportation management as the normative management of a specific function . Transportation management as a broader executive function is the subject of only a minority of clusters and publications ( i . e . , just 7 clusters exclusively fall into these three cells ) . While publications referring to transportation management as a specific function assume a multiplicity of perspectives ( e . g . , regulator , manufacturer , passenger , carrier , etc . ) , transportation as an executive function is clearly limited to the perspective of transport services suppliers . Here as well , themes relating to operational management concerns seem to dominate research . However , the difference in weights attached to strategic versus operational concerns is by far less distinguished and there is even overlap in terms of the “Innovation” and “Risk management” clusters . In addition , there are no purely normative matters since both clusters 10 ( “Socially sustainable transportation” ) and 36 ( “Leadership ( in culturally diverse contexts ) ” ) refer to normative and strategic management aspects . A likely explanation for the overwhelming dominance of publications and themes that relate to transportation management as a specific function at an operational level ties back to researchers’ motivation to publish transportation research . Transportation - specific rather than general management research efforts are warranted and relevant for those aspects of management that are specific to the transportation subject , i . e . , the physical movement of freight and passengers between spatial locations as specified , for example , according to Bardi and colleagues’ ( 2006 ) definition . This includes the management of transportation as a specific function from the perspective of governmental and national economies and is part of strategic considerations in supply chain management . Moreover , for most clusters that dwell on aspects of transportation management as a specific function , there are dedicated literature reviews ( e . g . , Ellram et al . , 2007 ; Giaglis et al . , 2004 ; Perego et al . , 2011 ) – which can scarcely be found for transportation management as an executive function ( e . g . , Keller & Ozment , 2009 ) . Given the limited research on transportation management as an executive function , the question is whether the characteristics and peculiarities of organizations that supply transportation services would not legitimize more research dedicated to these kinds of organizations – specifically at a normative and strategic level . We believe that there are three dominant interpretations to the underrepresentation of this type of research : First , transportation suppliers might be too diverse a pool of organizations to draw conclusions that generalize to a sufficiently large population ; second , insights from general management research apply to transportation suppliers to such an extent that dedicated research in the transportation domain is not appropriate ; or third , transportation organizations have slipped management and organization researchers’ attention for a lack of unifying research challenges that generalize across transportation suppliers . Most likely , there is a grain of truth in all three explanations , which is why we consider them all to legitimize the subsequent research agenda that aims to stimulate more research on transportation management as an executive function . The agenda revolves around two central issues : ( 1 ) network effects and ( 2 ) ownership and public interest . First , most transportation services providers rely on network infrastructure and other institutions , firms , or actors to create value for their different types of customers ( e . g . , shippers , authorities , passengers , etc . ) and capture value from these activities ( Katz & The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 26 © SBB Lab Shapiro , 1994 ) . While there is transportation - specific research on alliances and cooperation ( e . g . , Evans , 2001 ; Li & Chan , 2012 ) , transportation management research seems to be lacking studies that investigate the co - specialization of network infrastructure and transportation services along the lines of organizational and conglomerate structures and business models from a strategic perspective . This is relevant to transportation organizations considering , for example , the privatization of transportation network infrastructure and regulatory changes in the railway industry throughout Europe ( e . g . , Jupe , 2010 ; Laperrouza & Finger , 2009 ) and might potentially enable new taxonomies of contingent system configurations optimized for different performance outcomes . Second , while ownership and public interest are considered outside - in from a regulator’s perspective ( cf . clusters 5 , 7 , and 13 ) , there is surprisingly little research on how transportation organizations in regulated contexts and at different levels of public ownership may handle the goal conflicts and actors’ converging interests while planning for sustainable service performance – both economically and environmentally . A recent surge in management and organization research drawing on new institutional theory and concepts to explain and predict actor and organizational behavior ( Greenwood , Raynard , Kodeih , Micelotta , & Lounsbury , 2011 ; Thornton , Ocasio , & Lounsbury , 2012 ) might benefit transportation organizations with regard to both normative and strategic matters on the one hand , and provide a valuable context to generate new insights that can be generalized to a broader set of pluralist industries ( Denis , Langley , & Rouleau , 2007 ) . The intellectual structure of transportation management research : A review of the literature 27 © SBB Lab 6 Conclusions and limitations Transportation industries and practices have provided some important early stimuli for reasoning about management and organizational concepts ( Bucheli , Mahoney , & Vaaler , 2010 ; Chandler , 1962 ) . However , despite these early impulses , research that associates itself with transportation management only started to rise in the mid - 1990s . This study sheds light on the implicit structural definition of transportation management in the field , identifies dominant topics and suggests two avenues for further research . By means of a bibliometrical literature review , we identify 55 topical clusters based on 900 scholarly articles published in the big five databases between 1946 and 2012 . These relevant articles do not represent a sample but rather the nearest approximation to the entire population of peer - reviewed writing on the subject . Together , these 55 clusters represent the hitherto implicit intellectual structure of the body of knowledge on transportation management research . We demonstrate that transportation management can be viewed as both a specific function focused on physically moving freight and passengers as well as an executive function . Overall , the intellectual structure is dominated by themes that refer to transportation management as a specific function at an operational level such as supply chain management as well as traffic management and engineering . This is not surprising given that transportation - specific rather than general management research efforts are warranted and relevant for those aspects of management that are specific to the transportation subject . In contrast , however , we identified little research on transportation management as an executive function at any level ( i . e . , normative , strategic , or operational management ) . This is surprising because there are management challenges that can be generalized across transportation services suppliers and might even be generalizable to other industry contexts . Particularly , more research on the strategic issues of co - specializing network infrastructures and transportation services along the lines of organizational and conglomerate structures as well as business models and research into dealing with institutional complexity might benefit both practitioner and academic communities . Finally , this study is subject to three major limitations that might provide clues for further research into the structure of transportation management research : First , we consider all publications in the relevant set as additive contributions to the body of knowledge on transportation management research . Future studies may want to identify thresholds and identify shifts of clusters and dominant associations across consecutive time periods ( e . g . , Ronda - Pupo & Guerras - Martin , 2012 ) . Second , we base our co - word analysis on author - and / or database - supplied keywords . This avoids indexer biases ( Ding et al . , 2001 ) but is prone to suffer from quality differences in the way supplied keywords adequately reflect content . We tried to mitigate these effects by referring to titles , abstracts , and original texts to understand keywords in contexts ( Ramos - Rodriguez & Rui - Navarro , 2004 ) . And finally , systematically including expert panel suggestions ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) might address the fact that co - word analysis is backward oriented ( Samiee & Chabowski , 2012 ) .
