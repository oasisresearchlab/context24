Rao Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP1 ) stimulates phosphorylation of cortactin on Y421 and Y446 residues in a time - dependent manner and phosphorylation at Y446 but not Y421 residue is required for MCP1 - induced CDK - interacting protein 1 ( p21Cip1 ) nuclear export and degradation in facilitating human aortic smooth muscle cell ( HASMC ) proliferation . In addition , MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation are dependent on Fyn activation . Upstream to Fyn , MCP1 stimulated C - C chemokine receptor type 2 ( CCR2 ) and Gi / o and inhibition of either one of these molecules using their specific antagonists or inhibitors attenuated MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . Cortactin phosphorylation at Y446 residue is also required for another G protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) agonist , thrombin - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and its degradation in promoting HASMC proliferation . Quite interestingly , the receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) agonist , platelet - derived growth factor - BB ( PDGF - BB ) - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation do not require cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . Together , these findings demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin at Y446 residue is selective for only GPCR but not RTK agonist - induced nuclear export and proteolytic degradation of p21Cip1 in HASMC proliferation . Cell proliferation plays an essential role in the development of an organism and tissue repairing 1 . However , an increase in demand for cell proliferation due to chronic inflammatory responses , hormonal dysfunctions , com - pensation for tissue damage or disease leads to hyperplasia 2 . There are many commonly known clinical forms of hyperplasia among which intimal hyperplasia is the major cause of restenosis , characterized by arterial wall thickening with decreased arterial lumen space , which occurs as a response to vascular injury 3 . Vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) proliferation along with its migration into the tunica intima is the root cause of restenosis 4 , 5 . A variety of stimulants that are produced at the site of vascular injury appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of restenosis 4 . Among the many molecules identified , the artery produces a chemokine , monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP1 ) acutely and robustly in response to injury 6 , which in turn , stimulates VSMC motility and multi - plication leading to vascular wall remodeling 7 , 8 . Although many studies have reported a role for various signaling molecules in human aortic smooth muscle cell ( HASMC ) migration and proliferation , the role of cytoskeletal proteins in these effects are not well understood . In a recent study , we reported that cortactin , an actin binding protein , mediates MCP1 - induced actin polymerization and HASMC migration 9 . Cortactin , which was initially identified as a Src substrate , was later found as a nucleation - promoting factor 10 , 11 and its role in cell migration , endocytosis and vesicle trafficking has been well studied 12 . Post - translational modifications of cortactin especially acetylation and phosphorylation were shown to govern its interactions with other cytoskeletal proteins in the modulation of cell migration 12 – 16 . Cortactin acetylation by histone acetyltransferase p300 neutralizes its charged lysine residues and inhibits its binding to F - actin leading to reduced cell migration 17 . On the other hand , cortactin deacetylation by histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) such as HDAC6 or HDAC8 and sirtuins such as sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) increases its binding to F - actin and promotes cell migration 17 – 19 . Cortactin phosphorylation at S405 and S418 by p21 - activated kinase 1 ( Pak1 ) and extracellu - lar signal - regulated kinases 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) is required for its interaction with neural Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome Department of Physiology , University of Tennessee Health Science Center , Memphis , TN 38163 , USA .

Recently , we have reported that cortactin phosphorylation at S405 and S418 residues by protein kinase C δ ( PKC δ ) is needed for its interaction with WASP family protein member 2 ( WAVE2 ) in facilitating actin polymerization and VSMC migra - tion 9 . In addition , cortactin was shown to be phosphorylated by several non - receptor tyrosine kinases such as the Src family of protein kinases , the Abelson ( ABL ) family of protein kinases , feline encephalitis virus - related ( FER ) kinase and spleen tyrosine kinase 14 , 16 , 21 , 22 . It was also reported that phosphorylation of mouse cortactin at Y421 , Y466 and Y482 residues ( equivalent to Y421 , Y470 and Y486 residues in human cortactin ) is required for its role in lamellipodia formation and cell migration 13 . Furthermore , human cortactin phosphorylation at Y446 residue has been reported to be required for its role in cellular protection from hyperosmotic stress - induced apoptosis 23 . Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation has also been shown to play a role in endocytosis of various receptors 24 , 25 . While the functional role of cortactin in cell migration and receptor endocytosis has been well studied , its role in cell proliferation is limited to a few studies . Overexpression of cortactin enhances serum - and epider - mal growth factor - stimulated proliferation of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells 26 . In addition , it was shown that depletion of cortactin levels increases cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitors ( CDKIs ) leading to blockade of S - phase entry and cell cycle progression of 11q13 - amplified head and neck squamous carcinoma cells 27 . A recent study has also shown that cortactin overexpression besides migration promotes SGC - 7901 gastric can - cer cell invasion and proliferation 28 . Cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitors of the Cip / Kip family , namely , p21Cip1 , p27Kip1 , and p57Kip2 play an important role in the negative regulation of cell cycle progression 29 . Furthermore , it was reported that p21Cip1 besides inhibiting CDK2 activity also binds to , and suppresses pro - liferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) activity in blocking cell proliferation 30 . Based on all these reports it may be suggested that cortactin plays an important role in the modulation of cell proliferation . Despite these clues on the role of cortactin in cell proliferation , its involvement in VSMC proliferation and neointima formation is not known . Therefore , in the present study , we studied the role of cortactin in MCP1 - induced HASMC proliferation . Here , we report that CCR2 , Gi / o and Fyn - mediated phosphorylation of cortactin at Y446 residue is required for MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and degradation leading to HASMC proliferation . Results Cortactin mediates MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation . Studies from various laboratories includ - ing ours have demonstrated that cortactin plays an important role in cell migration 9 , 15 , 31 . Although cortactin role in cell migration has been well established , its role in cell proliferation is not clear . Since MCP1 acts as a che - moattractant and mitogen to VSMCs 7 , 32 , we asked the question whether cortactin plays a role in MCP1 - induced HASMC proliferation . To address this , we applied a small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) approach to deplete cortactin levels and studied its role in MCP1 - induced HASMC proliferation . Depletion of cortactin levels by its siRNA molecules prevented MCP1 - induced HASMC DNA synthesis ( Fig . 1a ) . In order to understand the mechanism ( s ) by which cortactin plays a role in MCP1 - induced HASMC DNA synthesis , first we have studied the effect of MCP1 on cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclins ( cyclin D1 and cyclin A2 ) and CDKIs ( p21Cip1 , p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 ) . MCP1 while having no effect on p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 levels induced cyclin D1 and cyclin A2 expression and downregulated p21Cip1 levels in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 1b ) . In addition , siRNA - me - diated depletion of cortactin levels without affecting cyclin D1 and cyclin A2 levels inhibited MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 downregulation ( Fig . 1c ) . Many studies have reported that p21Cip1 undergoes proteasome - medi - ated degradation in response to mitogens 33 , 34 . In order to understand the mechanisms by which MCP1 induces p21Cip1 downregulation , we studied the effect of MG132 , a potent inhibitor of proteasomes 34 . MG132 blocked MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 downregulation and HASMC DNA synthesis indicating that p21Cip1 undergoes pro - teasome - mediated degradation , thereby facilitating HASMC proliferation in response to MCP1 ( Fig . 1d , e ) . To obtain evidence supporting this point , we have studied the effect of MCP1 on p21Cip1 and 20S proteasome co - localization . As measured by co - immunostaining for p21Cip1 and proteasome 20S α / β subunits , MCP1 induced p21Cip1 co - localization with 20S proteasomes in a time - dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . In addition , siRNA - mediated depletion of cortactin levels inhibited MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 co - localization with 20S proteasomes ( Fig . 1f ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and degradation . Recently , we have reported that MCP1 induces serine phosphorylation of cortactin on S405 and S418 residues in enhancing F - actin stress fiber formation and HASMC migration 9 . Therefore , to under - stand the mechanisms by which cortactin mediates MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and degradation , we have examined for the role of its serine phosphorylation . Forced expression of S405A or S418A cortactin single or double mutants had no effect on MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC DNA synthesis ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Next , we have explored the role of its acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 deg - radation . MCP1 induced cortactin deacetylation and its tyrosine phosphorylation in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 2c ) . It was previously reported that HDAC6 and HDAC8 mediate cortactin deacetylation 17 , 19 . Based on this information , we have tested the role of HDAC6 and HDAC8 in MCP1 - induced cortactin deacetylation . Inhibition of HDAC6 but not HDAC8 blocked MCP1 - induced cortactin deacetylation ( Fig . 2d ) . However , inhibi - tion of HDAC6 had no effect on MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation ( Fig . 2e ) , indicating a lack of a role of cort - actin deacetylation in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation . Next , we examined for the role of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . Since there are five potential tyrosine residues in human cortactin , initially we have mutated all of these five tyrosine ( Y421 , Y446 , Y453 , Y470 and Y486 ) residues in GFP - cortactin expression vector using multi site - directed mutagenesis and named the resulting expression vector as Y5F - CTTN ( Fig . 2f ) . Overexpression of Y5F - CTTN mutant blocked MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC DNA synthesis , suggesting that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 depletion and HASMC proliferation ( Fig . 2g , h ) . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 3 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 28687 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep28687 Figure 1 .

( c ) All the conditions were same as in panel b except that cells were subjected www . nature . com / scientificreports / 6 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 28687 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep28687 Since cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is required for MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation , we next wanted to identify the tyrosine residue ( s ) that are phosphorylated by MCP1 . To gain insights into this , we mutated each of the five tyrosine residues to phenylalanine by site - directed mutagenesis and tested their effects on MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . While Y453F , Y470F , and Y486F cortactin mutants had no effect , the Y421F and Y446F cortactin mutants prevented MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , suggesting that MCP1 induces phosphorylation of cortactin at Y421 and Y446 residues ( Fig . 3a ) . However , only Y446F but not the Y421F cortactin mutant abolished MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degra - dation ( Fig . 3a ) . In addition , Y446F but not the Y421F cortactin mutant inhibited p21Cip1 and 20S proteasome co - localization as well as HASMC DNA synthesis induced by MCP1 , suggesting that cortactin phosphorylation at Y446 residue is required for MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and its degradation leading to HASMC proliferation ( Fig . 3b , c ) . To confirm p21Cip1 and 20S proteasome co - localization , we have used a different anti - body that recognizes proteasome 20S α 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 & 7 subunits for coimmunostaining along with p21Cip1 and obtained similar results as those shown in Fig . 3b ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . We further tested the effect of cortac - tin Y446F mutant on the translocation of p21Cip1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm . MCP1 induced transloca - tion of p21Cip1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a time - dependent manner , appearing only in the cytoplasm at 4 hrs and disappearing both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm at 8 hrs , indicating its degradation at the latter time point ( Fig . 3d ) and overexpression of cortactin Y446F mutant prevented these effects ( Fig . 3e ) . Since forced expression of cortactin Y446F mutant blocked MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm , it is likely that this mutant is acting as a dominant negative mutant . To show the transfection efficiency and differential effects of WT and Y446F cortactin mutant on MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and deg - radation visually , cells were transfected with GFP - WT or GFP - Y446F cortactin mutant , growth - arrested , treated with and without MCP1 in the presence and absence of MG132 for 6 hrs and co - immunostained for GFP along with p21Cip1 . First , since most of the cells exhibited green fluorescence , it is likely that almost all the cells were transfected with GFP - WT or GFP - Y446F cortactin mutant ( Supplementary Fig . S3a ) . Second , in cells expressing WT cortactin , the p21Cip1 was found only in the nucleus and in response to treatment with MCP1 , its presence was barely detected only in the cytoplasm indicating its degradation . In addition , in the presence of MG132 , the p21Cip1 was found to be accumulated mostly in the cytoplasm of the MCP1 - treated cells , suggesting that inhibi - tion of proteasomal activity only prevented MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation but not its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ( Supplementary Fig . S3b ) . On the other hand , in cells transfected with Y446F cort - actin mutant , the p21Cip1 was retained only in the nucleus regardless of the treatment with and without MCP1 in the presence or absence of MG132 ( Supplementary Fig . S3b ) . These findings suggest that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation at Y446 residue plays a role in p21Cip1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm . To find whether tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin leads to its serine phosphorylation or deacetylation in mediating MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and degradation , we tested the effects of Y421F and Y446F cortactin mutants in MCP1 - induced cortactin serine phosphorylation and its deacetylation . Neither mutant had any effect on MCP1 - induced cortactin serine phosphorylation or its deacetylation ( Fig . 3f ) . Fyn mediates MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . It was reported that cortactin is a substrate for the Src family of the kinases ( SFKs ) 12 , 35 . Therefore , to explore the mechanisms of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , we tested the effects of PP1 and PP2 , two potent SFK inhibitors , and their structural analog PP3 , which does not affect SFK , on MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC DNA synthesis . PP1 and PP2 but not PP3 blocked MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation , p21Cip1 co - localization with 20S proteasomes and HASMC DNA synthesis ( Fig . 4a , b and Supplementary Fig . S4 ) , sug - gesting that SFKs mediate MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , thereby causing p21Cip1 nuclear export and degradation leading to HASMC proliferation . In order to identify the specific SFK mediating cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , we have studied the time course effect of MCP1 on phosphorylation of Fyn , Lck , Lyn , Src and Yes . Among the SFKs tested , only Fyn was found to be phosphorylated by MCP1 in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 4c ) and this effect was blocked by both PP1 and PP2 ( Fig . 4d ) . Based on these observations , we next tested the role of Fyn in MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation , p21Cip1 and 20S proteasome co - localization and HASMC DNA synthesis . Downregulation of Fyn levels by its siRNA mole - cules blocked MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation and p21Cip1 degradation ( Fig . 4e ) . Consistent with these observations , depletion of Fyn levels also prevented p21Cip1 co - localization with 20S proteasomes and inhibited HASMC DNA synthesis ( Fig . 4f , g ) . to MCP1 - induced DNA synthesis . ( d ) The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions ( CF and NF , respectively ) of control and the indicated time periods of MCP1 - treated HASMCs were analyzed by Western blotting for p21Cip1 levels and reprobed for MEK1 and p53 levels to show the relative purity of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions , respectively . ( e ) Cells were transfected with GFP - tagged WT or Y446F mutant cortactin expression vector , growth - arrested , treated with vehicle or MCP1 for 4 hrs , cell extracts prepared and an equal amount of protein form the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was analyzed by Western blotting for p21Cip1 , MEK1 and p53 levels as described in panel d .

In our previous study we have demonstrated that G α q / 11 mediates MCP1 - induced cortactin serine phosphorylation via PLC β 3 - dependent PKC δ activation 9 . Therefore , we tested the role of G α q / 11 in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation . However , depleting G α q / 11 levels had no effect on MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation ( Fig . 5a ) , suggesting a lack of a role for G α q / 11 in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 downregulation . Based on these observations , we next tested the effect of pertussis toxin ( PT ) , specific inhibitor of G α i / o , on MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation and found that it inhibits MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degrada - tion ( Fig . 5b ) . In addition , PT blocked MCP1 - induced Fyn and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 and 20S proteasome co - localization and HASMC DNA synthesis ( Fig . 5c – e ) . These results suggest that G α i / o mediates MCP1 - induced Fyn - dependent cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . CCR2 but not CCR4 activation is required for Gi / o - dependent Fyn and cortactin tyrosine phos - phorylation in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . MCP1 mediates its effects via its receptors CCR2 and CCR4 36 . However , in HASMCs , it is not known which of these receptors mediate MCP1 - induced Fyn and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC prolif - eration . We have recently reported that both CCR2 and CCR4 are present in HASMCs 9 . Therefore , to study the role of these receptors in MCP1 - induced HASMC proliferation , we used their antagonists , CCR2A and CCR4A , respectively . CCR2A but not CCR4A inhibited MCP1 - induced Fyn and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation , p21Cip1 and 20S proteasome co - localization and HASMC DNA synthesis ( Fig . 6a – d ) . These findings indicate that CCR2 is the major receptor in mediating MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . It was reported that thrombin , a GPCR agonist , activates SFKs in calcium - dependent manner 37 . Since MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation and p21Cip1 degradation are dependent on Fyn activation , we have tested the role of calcium . BAPTA - AM , a cell - permeable calcium chelator , had no effect on MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation or p21Cip1 degradation ( Fig . 6e ) . These findings show that MCP1 induces cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation and p21Cip1 degradation in a manner that is independent of calcium mobilization . Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is selective for GPCR but not RTK agonist - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . To find the specificity of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation signaling in MCP1 - induced HASMC proliferation , we first tested the effect of Y446F cortactin mutant on MCP1 , thrombin and PDGF - BB - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . Surprisingly , overexpression of Y446F cortactin mutant prevented only MCP1 and thrombin but not PDGF - BB - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphoryl - ation ( Fig . 7a ) . These findings infer that only GPCR agonists but not RTK agonists induce cortactin phosphoryl - ation at Y446 residue . To find whether cortactin phosphorylation at Y446 residue is also required for only GPCR agonist - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation , we next tested the effect of Y446F cortactin mutant on MCP1 , thrombin and PDGF - BB - induced p21Cip1 downregulation and HASMC DNA synthesis . Consistent with its effect on cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , Y446F cortactin mutant inhibited only MCP1 and thrombin but not PDGF - BB - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC DNA synthesis ( Fig . 7b , c ) . In order to examine whether cortactin phosphorylation at other tyrosine residues might be involved in PDGF - BB - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation , we studied the effect of Y5F cortactin mutant . Interestingly , Y5F cortactin mutant while blocking cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation had no effect on PDGF - BB - induced p21Cip1 downregulation and HASMC DNA synthesis ( Fig . 7d – f ) . Discussion Many studies have demonstrated a role for cortactin in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration 11 , 12 . Cortactin due to its up regulation during cancer invasion has also been considered as an important biomarker for melanoma , colorectal cancer and glioblastoma 38 , 39 . In addition , cortactin has been reported to play a role in endocytosis , invadopodia and podosome formation 40 , 41 . The functional role of cortactin is mainly regulated by its post - translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation 12 . Previous studies have shown that deacetylation of cortactin by HDACs or sirtuins increases its binding capacity to F - actin and pro - motes cell migration 17 – 19 . On the other hand , phosphorylation of cortactin at S405 and S418 residues has been shown to promote G - actin polymerization and lamellipodium formation 14 , 20 . In addition , it was demonstrated that cortactin via its tyrosine phosphorylation interacts with many SH2 - domain containing proteins and thereby enhances Arp2 / 3 complex formation during G - actin polymerization and cell migration 42 . It was further reported that the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is essential for its role in receptor endocytosis , lamellipodium formation and cell migration 13 , 24 , 25 , 43 . In a recent study , we have shown that cortactin phosphorylation at S405 and S418 residues is required for its interaction with WAVE2 in facilitating G - actin polymerization and HASMC migration 9 . Although a large body of data demonstrates a role for cortactin in regulating cytoskeleton remodeling and cell migration , only a few studies show that cortactin also plays a role in the modulation of cell prolifera - tion 26 – 28 . Since our previous study showed a role for cortactin in MCP1 - induced HASMC migration , we asked the question whether cortactin has any role in MCP1 - induced HASMC proliferation . In this context , it is interesting to note that depleting cortactin levels negates MCP1 - induced HASMC proliferation and this effect correlates with blockade of p21Cip1 degradation . It was also reported that depletion of cortactin levels leads to upregu - lation of p21Cip1 levels at both mRNA and protein levels in FaDu cells 27 . In understanding the mechanisms of p21Cip1 downregulation by MCP1 , initially we tested the role of cortactin deacetylation . Although inhibition of HDAC6 prevents MCP1 - induced cortactin deacetylation , it had no effect on MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degrada - tion , suggesting a lack of a role for cortactin deacetylation in MCP1 - induced HASMC proliferation .

Using mass spectrometry , some reports have identified Y421 , Y446 , Y453 , Y470 and Y486 res - idues as potential sites of human cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation 13 , 44 . In addition , other studies have shown that phosphorylation of cortactin at Y421 , Y470 and Y486 residues is needed for its role in cell migration 13 , 43 . However , the role of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in the modulation of cell proliferation is not clear . In this context , the present study shows that MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation require phosphorylation of cortactin at Y446 but not Y421 residue . In addition , other reports showed that cortactin phosphorylation at Y446 residue was involved in the protection of HeLa cells from hyperosmotic stress - induced apoptosis 23 . A large body of data shows that p21Cip1 undergoes either ubiquitin - dependent or independent proteasome - mediated degradation in many cell types 45 , 46 . It was also reported that p21Cip1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and its degradation require its Ser / Thr phosphorylation 47 , 48 . In the present study , we show that Y446F cortactin mutant prevents MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 translocation from the nucleus to the cyto - plasm , suggesting a role for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export . It was reported that cortactin phosphorylation at Y466 residue promotes its deacetylation and prevents mouse fibroblast spreading 49 . However , in the present study we found that Y421F or Y446F cortactin mutants have no effect on MCP1 - induced cortactin deacetylation or its serine phosphorylation . These findings infer that tyrosine phos - phorylation of cortactin does not lead to its deacetylation or serine phosphorylation in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and its degradation . In other words , tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin alone is sufficient in mediating MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 nuclear export and its degradation . It is noteworthy that besides MCP1 , thrombin but not PDGF - BB stimulates cortactin phosphorylation at Y446 residue and this event is required for thrombin - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . Although , PDGF - BB induced cortactin phosphorylation at other tyrosine residues , those sites appear to be not required for PDGF - BB - induced p21Cip1 degradation or HASMC proliferation . Thus , these findings indicate that the involvement of cortactin phosphorylation at Y446 residue in p21Cip1 degradation is selective to GPCR agonists . Previous studies have reported that PDGF - BB induces tyrosine phosphorylation of murine cortactin on Y421 , Y466 and Y482 residues in the mediation of lamellipodium formation and cell migration 13 , 16 , 43 . Based on these observations as well as the present findings that PDGF - BB induces cortactin phosphorylation at site ( s ) other than Y446 residue in HASMCs , a role for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in PDGF - BB - induced cell migration cannot be eliminated . In elucidating the upstream mechanisms of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation by MCP1 , we found that MCP1 activates Fyn more robustly than the other SFK members and depleting its levels inhibits MCP1 - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . Fyn has also been shown to co - localize with cortactin in the mediation of metastatic murine melanoma cell migration 50 . Initially , it was discovered that cortactin was a substrate for Src 35 , although the later studies have shown that several other non - receptor tyrosine kinases including ABL , FER and / or Syk could also mediate its tyrosine phosphoryla - tion 16 , 21 , 22 , 51 . Interestingly , it was demonstrated that FER kinase phosphorylates cortactin downstream to Fyn in mediating osmotic stress - induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell volume 52 . Based on this finding , it may be suggested that MCP1 may activate FER downstream to Fyn in mediating p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation , which needs further experimentation . Since a role for several non - receptor tyrosine kinases in cortactin phosphorylation has been reported , it is possible that various tyrosine kinases may be involved in the phosphorylation of cortactin at different tyrosine residues in response to different agonists in mediating cell migration or cell proliferation . Although activation of SFKs by GPCR agonists such as thrombin requires cal - cium 37 , the present results show that MCP1 induces cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation and p21Cip1 degrada - tion via activation of Fyn in a manner that is independent of calcium mobilization . In our previous study , we have shown that MCP1 activates G α q / 11 via CCR2 in the modulation of HASMC migration 9 . Based on this observation , we suspected that Gq / 11 might be involved in MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . However , siRNA - mediated depletion of G α q / 11 levels had no effect on MCP1 - induced p21Cip1 degradation , suggesting a role for other G proteins in this effect . Indeed our results show that PT , a Gi / o - specific inhibitor , attenuates MCP1 - induced Fyn and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation leading to blockade of p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . These findings are also consistent with the previous reports that Gi / o mediates MCP1 - induced VSMC proliferation 53 . In addition , it was reported that thrombin - induced Src activity and fibroblast proliferation are PT - sensitive 54 . On the basis of these observations and present findings , we assume that Gi / o plays an important role in the modulation of Fyn activation leading to cortactin phosphorylation at that cells were subjected to the indicated agonist - induced DNA synthesis . ( d ) Cells were transfected with WT or Y5F mutant cortactin expression vector , growth - arrested , treated with vehicle or PDGF - BB for 6 hrs and cell extracts were prepared . Equal amount of protein from control and each treatment were immunoprecipitated with anti - GFP antibodies , and the immunocomplexes were analyzed by Western blotting with anti - pTyr antibodies and normalized to GFP . ( e ) All the conditions were the same as in panel d except that cells were treated with vehicle or PDGF - BB for 8 hrs and equal amounts of protein from each condition were analyzed by Western blotting for p21Cip1 levels using its specific antibodies and normalized to β - tubulin . The same cell extracts were also analyzed by Western blotting for GFP to show the overexpression of WT or mutant cortactin . ( f ) All the conditions were the same as in panel d except that cells were subjected to PDGF - BB - induced DNA synthesis . The bar graphs in panels a – f represent Mean ± SD values of three independent experiments . * p < 0 . 05 vs WT - CTTN ; * * p < 0 . 05 vs WT - CTTN + the indicated agonist . www . nature . com / scientificreports / 13 Scientific RepoRts | 6 : 28687 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / srep28687 Y446 residue , which in turn , promotes p21Cip1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and its degrada - tion . Many studies suggest that CCR2 is the major GPCR mediating MCP1 - induced chemotactic and mitogenic signaling in various cell types 9 , 36 . It is also important to note that despite the presence of both CCR2 and CCR4 receptors in HASMCs , only CCR2 but not CCR4 is involved in MCP1 - induced Fyn and cortactin tyrosine phos - phorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . Furthermore , although CCR2 couples to various G proteins , including Gq / 11 , G14 / 16 and Gi / o 13 , 55 , 56 , only CCR2 coupled to Gi / o proteins mediates MCP1 - induced Fyn and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , p21Cip1 degradation and HASMC proliferation . The role of CCR2 in HASMC proliferation can also be supported by the findings that CCR2 mediates MCP1 - induced VSMC pro - liferation during neointimal development 57 . In addition , other reports have shown that the Src family of tyrosine kinases are activated by MCP1 via CCR2 in monocytes and endothelial cells 58 . Furthermore , MCP1 signaling via CCR2 has been reported to enhance macrophage trafficking and immune responses in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis 59 . On the basis of all of these observations and our present findings , we conclude that CCR2 , upon activation by MCP1 , triggers Gi / o - Fyn - dependent cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , which in turn , facilitates p21Cip1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and its degradation leading to HASMC proliferation . In summary , as shown in Fig . 8 , cortactin phosphorylation at Y446 residue via CCR2 - Gi / o - mediated Fyn activation plays an important role in the translocation of p21Cip1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and its proteasome - mediated degradation facilitating HASMC proliferation in response to GPCR but not RTK agonists .
