We 39 recently reported that mature CRs in sea urchin embryos contain myosin II mini - filaments 40 organized into aligned concatenated arrays , and that in early CRs myosin II formed discrete 41 clusters that transformed into the linearized structure over time . The present study extends our 42 previous work by addressing the hypothesis that these myosin II clusters also contain the crucial 43 scaffolding proteins anillin and septin , known to help link actin , myosin II , RhoA , and the 44 membrane during cytokinesis . Super - resolution imaging of cortices from dividing embryos 45 indicates that within each cluster , anillin and septin2 occupy a centralized position relative to the 46 myosin II mini - filaments . As CR formation progresses , the myosin II , septin and anillin 47 containing clusters enlarge and coalesce into patchy and faintly linear patterns . Our super - 48 resolution images provide the initial visualization of anillin and septin nanostructure within an 49 animal cell CR , including evidence of a septin filament network . Furthermore , Latrunculin - 50 treated embryos indicated that the localization of septin or anillin to the myosin II clusters in the 51 early CR was not dependent on actin filaments . These results highlight the structural progression 52 of the CR in sea urchin embryos from an array of clusters to a linearized purse string , the 53 association of anillin and septin with this process , and provide , for the first time , the visualization 54 of septin filament higher order structure in an animal cell CR . 55 56 Introduction 57 The mediation of the process of cytokinesis is arguably the most essential function of the 58 actomyosin cytoskeleton in animal cells . Despite significant research efforts extending over 59 decades , key mechanisms underlying the formation of the cytokinetic contractile ring ( CR ) 60 remain poorly understood ( see recent reviews by Pollard , 2017 ; Glotzer , 2017 ; Mangione and 61 Gould , 2019 ; Pollard and O’Shaughnessy , 2019 ) . This is particularly the case in animal cells , 62 whereas in fission and budding yeast the roles of various CR - associated proteins and their 63 structures , interactions and mechanisms have been more extensively characterized , imaged and 64 modeled ( see recent reviews by Willet et al . , 2015 ; Meitinger and Palani , 2016 ; Glotzer , 2017 ; 65 Marquardt et al . , 2019 ) . 3 66 Our knowledge of the CR traces back to early transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) based 67 studies performed by Schroeder ( Schroeder , 1970 ; 1972 ; 1973 ) and others ( Perry et al . , 1971 ; 68 Sanger and Sanger , 1980 ; Maupin and Pollard , 1986 ) that established that cytokinesis in animal 69 cells was mediated by a circumferential ring of actin and putative non - muscle myosin II 70 filaments . Many of these CR studies hypothesized that the organization of actin and myosin II 71 facilitated a sliding filament - based “purse string contraction” mechanism for ring constriction . 72 However , clear evidence of the exact architecture of the CR was lacking in these earlier works 73 and only more recent studies employing super - resolution microscopy and head and tail - based 74 labeling of myosin II filaments ( Beach et al . , 2014 , Fenix et al . 2016 ; Henson et al . , 2017 ) have 75 demonstrated that myosin II within the mature CR is organized into aligned arrays that are 76 oriented appropriately for a purse string contraction mechanism . Our previous work also 77 extended this to the TEM level in which we used platinum replicas of cortices isolated from 78 dividing sea urchin embryos to show a purse - string consistent orientation of both actin and 79 myosin II filaments ( Henson et al . , 2017 ) . 80 This recent success in defining the actin and myosin II organization in the mature animal cell 81 CR does not discount the fact that many unanswered questions remain . For example , little is 82 known about the pre - CR structure in animal cells , although our recent work ( Henson et al . , 2017 ) 83 and other studies ( Maupin et al . 1994 ; Straight et al . , 2003 ; Werner et al . , 2007 , Foe and von 84 Dassow , 2008 ; Zhou and Wang , 2008 ; Osório et al . , 2019 ) suggest that the precursor of the CR 85 consists of an array of myosin II - containing clusters . In fission yeast , nodes of myosin II ( Myo2 ) 86 contribute to the CR assembly ( Pollard and Wu , 2010 ; Lee et al . , 2012 ; Laplante et al . , 2016 ) 87 through a search - capture and pull mechanism ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) and the interesting 88 possibility exists that the clusters present in animal cells correspond to evolutionarily derived 89 structures ( Cheffings et al . , 2016 ) . However , there are a number of fundamental differences 90 between the cell division mechanisms of yeast and those in animal cells , including yeast’s 91 intranuclear karyokinesis , the spatial regulation of septation , and the added complication of a cell 92 wall during cytokinesis . Therefore , despite the similarities between our actomyosin clusters and 93 yeast nodes , we hypothesize that the CR assembly in large embryonic cells derives from a hybrid 94 mechanism between yeast node congression and actomyosin contraction - based organization of 95 the linear arrays of actin and myosin II filaments in the mature CR . 4 96 Questions about animal cell CR organization extend well beyond the actomyosin structure to 97 the architecture and dynamics of two major CR scaffold proteins : septin and anillin . In budding 98 yeast , the formation of a ring of septin filaments is a crucial step in CR assembly ( Ong et al . 99 2014 ; Marquardt et al . , 2019 ) and septin is associated with the CR in animal cells where it is 100 thought to serve as a potential scaffold between the membrane , anillin , myosin II , and actin 101 ( Bridges and Gladfelter , 2015 ; Spiliotis , 2018 ) . However , no study to date has definitively 102 demonstrated the higher order structural organization of septins in an animal cell CR . In budding 103 yeast , the ultrastructural arrangement of septin filaments in the bud neck has been visualized 104 ( Ong et al . , 2014 ) , although the progressive ring , hourglass and then double ring septin filament 105 structures present are thought to be separate from the actomyosin ring ( Ong et al . 2014 ; 106 Marquardt et al . , 2019 ) . 107 Another scaffold protein critical for cytokinesis is anillin ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ) , which has 108 been demonstrated to serve as an integrating link between the major regulator of cytokinesis 109 RhoA and the CR components actin , myosin II , septin and formin in animal and yeast cells 110 ( Oegema et al . , 2000 ; Maddox et al . , 2005 ; Straight et al . , 2005 ; Maddox et al . , 2007 ; Hickson 111 and O’Farrell , 2008 ; Piekny and Glotzer , 2008 ; Piekny and Maddox , 2010 ; Glotzer , 2017 ; Carim 112 et al . , 2020 ) . In fission yeast its analogue is the protein Mid1 which is essential for the initiation 113 of the nodes which assemble into the CR ( Glotzer , 2017 ) . However , similar to the case with 114 septin filaments , little is known about the nanostructural organization of anillin in the animal cell 115 CR . This fundamental uncertainty about the precise structure , function and dynamics of the two 116 major cytokinetic scaffolding proteins argues that further work is needed to understand the 117 complex organization of the animal cell CR ( Cheffings et al . , 2016 ; Pollard , 2017 ; Mangione and 118 Gould , 2019 ) . 119 Echinoderm embryos have long served as a crucial experimental model for cytokinesis 120 research and have been used to demonstrate the existence of the CR ( Schroeder , 1972 ) , the 121 essential role for myosin II in CR contraction ( Mabuchi and Okuno , 1977 ) , and the involvement 122 of RhoA in the regulation of cytokinesis ( Mabuchi et al . , 1993 ; Bement et al . , 2005 ) . The sea 123 urchin embryo also affords an approach crucial to the investigation of the 3D arrangement of 124 ring constituents where CRs of early embryos can be isolated by adhering dividing embryos to 125 coverslips , and then applying a stream of buffer ( Henson et al . , 2019 ) . The CRs in these isolated 126 cortical preparations from first division embryos are roughly 10X larger than CRs in cultured 5 127 mammalian cells and therefore overcome the significant limitation of small cell size and 128 membrane curvature that plague studies trying to resolve the structure of the CR in mammalian 129 cells . The cortex isolation method also allows for visualization of the CR from the vantage point 130 of the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane . Multiple investigators have used isolated sea 131 urchin embryo cortices to examine CR structure ( Yonemura and Kinoshita , 1986 ; Otto and 132 Schroeder , 1990 ; Mabuchi , 1994 ; Uehara et al . , 2008 ) including our own recent work ( Henson et 133 al . , 2017 ) . 134 In the present study we use first division sea urchin embryos to investigate the structure and 135 dynamics of the CR components actomyosin , septin2 and anillin . We extend our previous work 136 by testing the hypothesis that the CR scaffolding proteins anillin and septin mirror the 137 transformation of structural organization we have reported for CR myosin II ( Henson et al . , 138 2017 ) . We start by characterizing antibody probes for sea urchin anillin and septin2 and then 139 investigate their localization in the CR relative to myosin II via super - resolution imaging . Our 140 results indicate that septin2 and anillin are affiliated with myosin II in the band of clusters / nodes 141 that appears to serve as a precursor to the CR early in the cell division process . Within each 142 cluster , anillin and septin2 both occupy a more central position relative to the myosin II 143 minifilament head groups . As CR formation progresses , the septin2 and anillin staining focus 144 into a narrower pattern coincident with a similar change in activated myosin II minifilament 145 distribution . Both 3D SIM and STED imaging provide the first clear evidence of the existence of 146 a network of septin filaments affiliated with myosin II in mature CRs . Furthermore , the 147 localization of either septin2 or anillin to the early CR myosin II clusters was not dependent on 148 actin filaments given that it occurred in embryos treated with Latrunculin prior to cell division . 149 Taken together these results underscore the structural evolution of the CR in sea urchin embryos 150 from an array of clusters to a linearized purse string , the critical scaffolding roles that anillin and 151 septin play based on their localizations with expected binding partners , and provide , for the first 152 time , the visualization of higher order septin filaments in the CR of an animal cell . 153 154 Materials and Methods 155 Animals , antibodies , and reagents 156 Lytechinus pictus sea urchins were purchased from Marinus Scientific ( Lakewood , CA ) and 157 Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sea urchins were collected from the waters surrounding Port 6 158 Townsend , WA , and maintained at the Friday Harbor Laboratories ( Friday Harbor , WA ) . All 159 animals were kept in either running natural sea water or closed artificial sea water systems at 10 - 160 15°C . 161 Primary antibodies used included a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against sea urchin egg 162 myosin II heavy chain isolated via ATP - based precipitation of actomyosin from S . purpuratus 163 egg extracts and electrophoretically purified ( Henson et al . , 1999 ) , a mouse monoclonal antibody 164 against the Ser19 phosphorylated form of myosin II regulatory light chain ( P - MyoRLC ) from 165 Cell Signaling Technology ( Danvers , MA ) , a rabbit monoclonal antibody against a peptide from 166 human septin 2 from Abcam , Inc ( Cambridge , MA ) , a mouse monoclonal antibody against a 167 conserved epitope of chicken gizzard actin ( clone C4 ) from EMD , Millipore ( Burlington , MA ) , a 168 rat monoclonal antibody against yeast alpha - tubulin ( clone YL1 / 2 ) from Thermo Fisher 169 Scientific ( Pittsburgh , PA ) , and a mouse monoclonal antibody against human RhoA / B / C ( clone 170 55 ) from Upstate Biotechnology ( Lake Placid , NY ) . In order to generate a sea urchin anillin 171 antibody , the PH domain of S . purpuratus anillin ( aa 980 - 1124 , Accession # XM _ 030975862 ) 172 was cloned into pET302 , expressed in E . coli , and the purified polypeptide used as the 173 immunogen for a commercially prepared rabbit polyclonal antiserum ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) 174 which was then affinity purified using the anillin PH domain . Appropriate secondary antibodies 175 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 , 555 , 568 , or Oregon Green as well as Alexa Fluor 488 , 633 , and 176 647 conjugated phalloidin were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific . Latrunculin A and B 177 ( LatA ; LatB ) were obtained from Cayman Chemical ( Ann Arbor MI ) . Unless otherwise 178 indicated , the majority of reagents were purchased from either Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) or 179 Thermo Fisher Scientific . 180 181 Gamete and coelomocyte collection , fertilization , and cleavage cortex isolation 182 Sea urchin gametes were collected via intracoelomic injection with 0 . 5 M KCl , with sperm 183 collected dry and eggs spawned in either natural sea water or MBL artificial sea water ( ASW : 184 423 mM NaCl , 9 mM KCl , 9 . 27 mM CaCl 2 , 22 . 94 mM MgCl 2 , 25 . 5 mM MgSO 4 , 2 . 14 mM 185 NaHCO 3 , pH 8 . 0 ) and subsequently dejellied by multiple washing with ASW . Eggs were 186 fertilized by addition of dilute sperm , the fertilization envelopes removed using 1 M urea ( pH 187 8 . 0 ) , and then washed into and reared in MBL calcium free sea water ( MBL ASW minus CaCl 2 188 and plus 1 mM EGTA ) at 10 - 15°C . For disruption of actin filaments embryos were treated with 7 189 either 1 µM LatA or 20 µM LatB starting at 30 - 60 min prior to first division . Cleavage cortices 190 were generated as described in Henson et al . ( 2019 ) . In brief , embryos at the appropriate stage of 191 cell division were allowed to quickly settle onto poly - L - lysine ( 2 mg / ml ) coated coverslips and 192 then exposed to fluid shear force from a pipette containing an isotonic cortex isolation buffer 193 ( CIB : 0 . 8 M mannitol , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , 100 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) . Isolated cortices 194 were rinsed twice in CIB prior to further processing for fluorescent staining . Sea urchin 195 coelomocytes were isolated from the perivisceral fluid of adult animals and maintained in 196 coelomocyte culture media ( 0 . 5 M NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , and 20 mM HEPES , pH 197 7 . 2 ) as described in Smith et al . ( 2019 ) . 198 199 Fixation , fluorescent staining and microscopic imaging and analysis 200 Embryos – either attached to poly - L - lysine coated coverslips or kept in suspension – were 201 fixed in Millonig’s fixative ( 0 . 2 M NaH 2 PO 4 , 0 . 136 M NaCl , pH 7 . 0 ) containing 3 . 7 % 202 formaldehyde for 20 minutes , washed 3X and then left overnight in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 203 phosphate buffered saline ( PBST ) , and then blocked overnight in 3 % BSA diluted in PBST . 204 Isolated cortices were fixed in 2 - 3 % formaldehyde in CIB for 5 min followed by blocking in 2 % 205 goat serum and 1 % BSA in PBS for at least 30 minutes . For immunolocalization of RhoA / B / C , 206 cortices were fixed in 10 % trichloroacetic acid following the methods of Yonemura et al . ( 2004 ) . 207 Coelomocytes were settled and fixed as described in Smith et al . ( 2019 ) . Immunostaining of all 208 samples was performed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies diluted in blocking 209 buffer with embryos typically being stained in each antibody step overnight whereas cortices and 210 coelomocytes were stained for 1 hour in each stage . Fluorescent phalloidin was added to the 211 secondary antibody staining step . Samples for conventional and 3D - SIM microscopy were 212 typically mounted in nonhardening Vectashield antifade mounting media ( Vector Laboratories , 213 Burlingame , CA ) plus or minus DAPI prior to imaging . Samples for STED imaging were 214 mounted in Prolong Diamond mounting media ( Thermo Fisher ) . 215 Conventional epifluorescence microscopy of samples was performed on a Nikon ( Tokyo , 216 Japan ) 80i microscope using either a 40X / 0 . 75 NA Plan Fluorite or 60X / 1 . 4 NA Plan Apo phase 217 contrast objective lens with digital images captured using a Photometrics ( Tuscon , AZ ) 218 CoolSnap Cf cooled CCD camera . Confocal microscopy was performed on either an Olympus 219 ( Tokyo , Japan ) Fluoview 500 laser scanning confocal microscope using a 40X / 1 . 15 NA UApo 8 220 water immersion DIC objective lens , or an Andor Dragonfly 505 spinning disk confocal system 221 ( Oxford Instruments , Abingdon , UK ) using either an Olympus 60X / 1 . 3 NA silicone or a 222 100X / 1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective lens . Spinning disk confocal digital images were 223 acquired with an Andor sCMOS EMCCD camera . 224 Super - resolution microscopy was performed using two different methods . For 3D structured 225 illumination microscopy ( 3D - SIM , Gustafsson et al . , 2008 ) we utilized a DeltaVision OMX 3D - 226 SIM Imaging System ( GE Healthcare Bio - Sciences , Pittsburgh , PA ) with an Olympus 60X / 1 . 42 227 NA objective lens . Captured images were reconstructed using SoftWoRx software . Stimulated 228 Emission Depletion ( STED ) super - resolution microscopy ( Hell and Wichmann , 1994 ) was 229 performed on a Leica ( Wetzlar , Germany ) Sp8 STED confocal using a 100X / 1 . 4 NA objective 230 lens . 231 For all forms of microscopic images , processing and analysis was performed using either 232 Fiji / ImageJ ( Bethesda , MD ) or Bitplane Imaris ( version 8 . 1 - 9 . 1 . 2 ; Andor ) . Graphs were prepared 233 and statistical analysis carried out using GraphPad Prism 8 ( San Diego , CA ) , with box and 234 whisker plots having the following attributes : the box extends from the 25 th to the 75 th 235 percentiles , the whiskers extend to the minimum and maximum values , and the line in the middle 236 of the box is the median . Final figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop ( San Jose , CA ) . 237 238 Gel sample lysates and immunoblotting 239 Sea urchin egg / embryo gel sample lysates were generated by pelleting cells and then adding 240 hot 2X sample buffer ( 625 mM Tris - HCl pH 6 . 8 , 25 % glycerol , 2 % SDS , 0 . 01 % bromophenol 241 blue , 5 % β - mercaptoethanol ) at five times the volume of packed cells followed by boiling for 5 242 minutes . Gel samples were loaded into a 4 - 15 % Mini - PROTEAN TGX precast protein gel ( Bio - 243 Rad ) and transferred onto an Immobilon PDF membrane ( Millipore ) for probing . Blocking and 244 antibody incubation was performed in TBS - Tween supplemented with 5 % instant milk . Bound 245 antibody detection was performed for septin2 immunoblots using alkaline phosphatase 246 conjugated secondary antibodies and a BCIP + NBT substrate . For anillin immunoblots HRP 247 conjugated secondary antibodies were used and detected by chemiluminescence using a Immun - 248 Star HRP kit , with imaging performed on a ChemiDoc XRS molecular imaging system from 249 Bio - Rad ( Hercules , CA ) . 250 9 251 Results 252 Characterization of antibodies against the sea urchin anillin PH domain and septin2 253 Sea urchin anillin is predicted to contain the domains that confer anillin with its unique CR 254 integration functions ( Piekny and Maddox , 2010 ) . These include a N - terminal domain ( NTD ) 255 with a formin binding site ( FBD ) , nearby myosin II and actin binding domains ( MBD and ABD ) , 256 an anillin homology domain ( AHD ) which interacts with RhoA , and a C terminus pleckstrin 257 homology ( PH ) domain which allows for binding with septin and membrane phospholipids 258 ( Figure 1A ) . The PH domain of S . purpuratus anillin was cloned and used to generate a rabbit 259 polyclonal antiserum which was affinity purified against the recombinant anillin PH domain and 260 its specificity confirmed by immunoblotting ( Figure 1B ) . Rabbit anti - sea urchin anillin reacted 261 with the purified recombinant 16 kDa anillin PH domain antigen , and with a ~ 120 kDa species in 262 S . purpuratus egg and embryo lysates consistent with the predicted molecular mass of S . 263 purpuratus anillin ( Figure 1B ) . 264 265 Figure 1 . Characterization of antibodies against sea urchin anillin and septin2 . ( A ) Starting at the N terminus , 266 the predicted domains of sea urchin anillin include a formin binding domain ( FBD ) , a N - terminal domain ( NTD ) , a 267 myosin II binding domain ( MBD ) , an actin binding domain ( ABD ) , a candidate nuclear localization sequence 268 ( RTRRR ) , an anillin homology domain ( AHD ) , and a plecstrin homology domain ( PH ) . The dashed boxes for FBD , 269 MBD , and ABD indicate approximate locations . ( B ) Immunoblot of affinity purified anti - sea urchin anillin PH 270 domain antibody against the purified peptide antigen ( Ag , lane 1 ) shows the expected 16 kDa immunoreactive band . 271 Blotting this antibody against lysates of either unfertilized S . purpuratus eggs ( UF , lane 2 ) , or first cleavage embryos 272 ( CL , lane 3 ) reveals a ~ 120 kDa immunoreactive band . ( C ) Immunoblot of anti - human septin2 peptide antibody 273 against L . pictus first cleavage embryo lysate ( lane 1 = total protein ; lane 2 = immunoblot ) reveals a ~ 45 kDa 274 immunoreactive species . ( D - J ) Anillin ( green ) staining of a S . purpuratus sperm aster stage early embryo ( D - G ) and 275 adult coelomocytes ( H - J ) shows that anillin localizes to the nucleus and in early embryos to the cortical region . 276 Embryos are co - labeled for microtubules ( magenta ) and DNA ( blue ) , whereas coelomocytes are co - labeled for actin 277 filaments ( magenta ) and DNA ( blue ) . ( K - M ) Septin2 ( green ) staining of adult S . purpuratus coelomocytes double 278 labeled for P - MyoRLC ( magenta ) demonstrates the expected staining of septin in stress fiber - like actomyosin 279 bundles in phagocytes and in the flagella of vibratile cells ( arrow in K ) . 280 281 Septins are a family of GTP - binding proteins that form filaments composed of linear arrays of 282 hetero - oligomers of different isoforms which vary across species ( Bridges and Gladfelter , 2015 ) , 283 and the sea urchin S . purpuratus genome has been shown to encode homologues of the human 10 284 Sept2 , Sept3 , Sept6 , and Sept7 subgroups ( Cao et al . , 2007 ) . Immunoblotting of an L . pictus 285 embryo lysate with a commercial rabbit monoclonal antibody against a peptide antigen ( between 286 aa 250 - 350 ) from human Sept2 resulted in an immunoreactive band of ~ 45 kDa which is similar 287 to the 42 kDa molecular mass of human Sept2 ( Figure 1C ) . 288 The sea urchin anillin and septin2 antibodies were initially further characterized by testing for 289 expected immunofluorescence staining patterns . Anillin proteins have a nuclear localization 290 sequence ( NLS ) and have been shown to be localized in the nucleus during interphase in some 291 species ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ; Oegema et al . , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ) . Sea urchin anillin has a 292 weak putative NLS ( aa 632 - 636 , Figure 1A ) and staining of newly fertilized , sperm aster stage 293 embryos shortly following syngamy with the anti - sea urchin anillin antibody showed it was 294 present within the zygote nucleus as well as in the cortex ( Figure 1D - G ) . Nuclear localization of 295 anillin in interphase cells was also observed in isolated adult sea urchin coelomocytes that are 296 terminally differentiated , post - mitotic cells ( Figure 1H - J ) . Septin filaments are known to localize 297 in stress fibers in cultured cells ( Spiliotis , 2018 ) and in cilia and flagella ( Palander et al . , 2017 ) . 298 Staining adult coelomocytes with the septin2 antibody showed clear localization in the stress 299 fiber - like actomyosin bundles of large phagocytes and in the flagellar axonemes of vibratile cells 300 ( Figure 1K - M ) . 301 302 Anillin and septin2 localize to the CR of whole embryos and isolated cleavage cortices 303 During first division of sea urchin embryos , overlapping microtubules from the asters deliver 304 the centralspindlin / RhoGEF complex to the equator that activates RhoA ( Bement et al . , 2005 ; 305 Argiros et al . , 2012 ; Su et al . , 2014 ) , which in turn is thought to help recruit anillin and activate 306 CR actomyosin contraction . Dividing embryos stained for microtubules and anillin showed that 307 the equatorial cortex accumulation of anillin – which was not apparent in late anaphase ( Figure 308 2A - C ) – appeared coincident with the invagination of the cleavage furrow in early telophase 309 ( Figure 2D - F ) , as has been described in other cell types ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ; Oegema et al . , 310 2000 ; Hickson and O ' Farrell , 2008 ; Kim et al . , 2017 ) . As the cleavage furrow ingressed with the 311 progression of telophase , anillin staining became highly concentrated in the region of the 312 cleavage furrow ( Figure 2D - O ) - with off axis images showing a clear ring shaped anillin - stained 313 structure ( Figure 2J - L ) - and remained associated with the midbody formation at the end of 314 cytokinesis ( Figure 2M - O ) . 11 315 316 Figure 2 . Anillin localizes to the cleavage furrow in first division embryos . In dividing S . purpuratus embryos 317 co - labeled for microtubules ( magenta ) and DNA ( white ; blue in L ) in order to determine mitotic progression , anillin 318 ( green ) staining is not obvious in late anaphase ( A - C ) but begins concentrating in the early cleavage furrow starting 319 at the initiation of telophase ( D - F ) and continues through the midbody stage prior to abscission in late telophase ( G - 320 O ) . In off axis images the anillin staining appears as an entire ring similar to other CR markers ( J - L ) . In L the phase 321 contrast image is superimposed on the fluorescence image for context . The magnifications of A - O are equivalent 322 and A - I plus M - O are confocal images whereas J - L are widefield images . 323 324 The CR in fixed sea urchin embryos can be readily stained using antibodies against the Ser19 325 phosphorylated form of the myosin II regulatory light chain ( P - MyoRLC ) which is indicative of 326 activated myosin II that is capable of actin - based contraction ( Foe and von Dassow , 2008 ; 327 Argiros et al . , 2012 ; Henson et al . , 2017 ) . Localization of either septin2 or anillin with P - 328 MyoRLC in whole embryos showed a clear association with the CR that began as a broad band 329 of clustered , reticular staining ( Figure 3A - D , M - P ) which then concentrated into a narrow ring as 330 furrowing progressed ( Figure 3E - H , Q - T ) , and culminated in retention in the midbody ( Figure 331 3I - L ) . 332 333 Figure 3 . Sept2 and anillin colocalize with the CR marker P - MyoRLC in first division embryos . Both sept2 334 ( A - L , green ) and anillin ( M - T , green ) mirror P - MyoRLC ( A - T , magenta ) staining in dividing embryos and begin as 335 collections of clusters ( A - D , M - P ) that progress to tight rings ( E - H , Q - T ) , and end concentrated in the midbody ( I - 336 L ) . L . pictus embryos appear in confocal images in A - L , S . purpuratus embryos appear in widefield images in M - T , 337 and the magnifications of A - T are equivalent . 338 339 Septin2 and anillin also localized with P - MyoRLC in the CR regions of cortices isolated from 340 dividing embryos ( Figure 4 ; 5 ) . In examining cortices from a time series of isolations over the 341 course of cytokinesis , those from earlier time points tended to display a broad band of punctate 342 clusters or nodes which contained septin2 , anillin and P - MyoRLC ( Figure 4A - D , I - L ; 5A - D ) . 343 Widefield imaging of these clusters suggested an incomplete overlap between the localization of 344 septin2 or anillin staining and that of P - MyoRLC . In cortices isolated in the mid to late stages of 345 cytokinesis , the septin2 , anillin and P - MyoRLC staining patterns ( Figure 4E - H , M - Q ) all 346 appeared to have coalesced into a patchy and more linearized pattern that became very 347 concentrated in the latest stage cortices ( Figure 5E - L ) . Quantification of the myosin II staining 12 348 patterns of 247 cortices from 3 separate experiments showed that in cortices isolated early in 349 cytokinesis ( Figure 4R ) punctate CR staining predominated ( 70 % of cortices with CRs ; Figure 350 4T ) , whereas in cortices isolated in mid - late cytokinesis ( Figure 4S ) patchy / linear CR staining 351 patterns were more prevalent ( 76 % of total cortices with CRs ; Figure 4T ) . Localization of 352 filamentous actin in cortices using phalloidin indicated that it codistributed with the clusters in 353 early stages ( Figure 5A - D ) and the condensed CR patterns present in late stages ( Figure 5E - L ) , 354 as well as staining the microvilli present in these cortices ( Figure 5C , G , K ) . RhoA / B / C was also 355 enriched in the CR region containing anillin ( Figure 5M - P ) , septin2 , actin and myosin II . 356 357 Figure 4 . Widefield imaging of isolated cortices shows that septin2 and anillin co - distribute with active 358 myosin II and progress from clusters to more linearized arrays . Sept2 , and active myosin II ( P - MyoRLC ) 359 localize together in the CR regions of isolated cortices ( A - H ) and progress from regularly spaced clusters in early 360 stages ( A - D ) to dense assemblages of more patchy and linear structures in late stages ( E - H ) . Anillin displays a 361 similar co - distribution with active myosin II , as well as the analogous evolution from clusters in early cortices ( I - L ) 362 to denser and more filamentous arrays in mid - late cortices ( M - Q ) . Lower magnification images of myosin II 363 ( MyoHC ) staining in cortices isolated early in cytokinesis ( R ) shows the presence of punctate clusters in a majority 364 of cortices containing CRs ( percentages graphed in T ) , whereas cortices isolated mid - late in cytokinesis ( S ) have a 365 majority of cortices with patchy / filamentous CR patterns ( percentages graphed in T ) .

Septin2 , active myosin II ( P - MyoRLC ) and F - actin staining 371 all associate with clusters in early CRs ( A - D ) , and with the denser , more linear arrays in late stage CRs ( E - H ) . 372 Anillin displays a similar association with active myosin II and F - actin in late stage CRs ( I - L ) and also codistributes 373 with Rho A / B / C in the CR ( M - P ) . Bar in A = 10 µm ; magnifications of A - L are equivalent . All cortices from S . 374 purpuratus embryos . 375 376 Super - resolution microscopy reveals the organization of myosin II , anillin and septin2 377 clusters that serve as CR precursors 378 Consistent with our widefield imaging ( Figure 4 ; 5 ) , 3D - SIM imaging of early cleavage stage 379 cortices demonstrated that myosin II , septin2 and anillin are all organized in a broad band of 380 regularly spaced clusters ( Figure 6 ) . Within these ring or stellate shaped clusters , the distribution 381 of the myosin II heavy chain ( MyoHC ) tail and the P - MyoRLC head antibody probes 13 382 ( characterized in Henson et al . , 2017 ) often indicated an extensive overlap of these two regions , 383 suggesting that myosin II filaments may be densely packed ( Figure 6A , D , G ) . The myosin II 384 stained clusters would often form rings with hollow centers ( Figure 6D ; 7B , C ) in which it 385 appeared that myosin II minifilaments were arrayed around the periphery in a head to head 386 circular structure ( Figure 7B , C ) . In some stellate - shaped clusters the myosin II minifilaments had 387 adopted the linear alignment of head - to - head chains or networks ( Figure 6D , G ; 7A ) that our 388 previous TEM images have shown to exist in the CR in embryos and in the cytoskeleton of 389 coelomocytes ( Henson et al . , 2017 ) . Z axial images indicated a significant superposition between 390 the two myosin II probes , with the suggestion that the myosin II heads might be farther away 391 from the membrane ( bottom of image ) than the tail regions ( Figure 6J ) . However , the lower 392 resolution and distorted nature of 3D - SIM Z axial images make it difficult to draw any definitive 393 conclusions . 394 395 Figure 6 . 3D - SIM super - resolution imaging of clusters of myosin II , septin2 and anillin in early CR stage 396 cortices .

The pattern of septin2 labeling was 421 often ring - shaped and in some cases resembled short segments of filaments ( Figure 6E , H ) . The Z 422 axial images of septin2 and P - MyoRLC ( Figure 6K ) showed overlap and no clear distinction in 423 the orientation of the two labels . 3D - SIM imaging of anillin and P - MyoRLC demonstrated that 424 anillin also appeared to occupy the cluster centers and was organized in punctate , ring or C - 425 shaped structures that appeared in close proximity to the myosin II head probe ( Figure 6C , F , I ; 426 7F , G ) . 2D line scans and 3D surface plots of the anillin and P - MyoRLC relative intensities 427 ( Figure 7J , K ) corroborated anillin’s central location , with 77 % of clusters analyzed showing 428 centralized anillin ( Figure 7L ) . Interestingly , the Z axial images of anillin and P - MyoRLC 429 ( Figure 6L ) showed a clear distinction in the orientation of the anillin and myosin II head probes 430 with the anillin being closer to the membrane ( bottom of image in Figure 6L ) . For quantification 431 of septin2 and anillin positioning in clusters , 299 total clusters were analyzed from three separate 432 experiments . 433 Examination of cortices isolated in a time series showed that clusters from cortices later in 434 cytokinesis became larger in size and more extensive ( Figure 6M ) although they appeared to 435 retain the overall organization of myosin II , septin2 , and anillin apparent in smaller clusters . 436 Taken together these images suggest that these myosin II , septin2 and anillin clusters are 437 precursors of the CR and that their growth and coalescence over time generates the mature 438 structure of the CR . They also indicate a codependence in terms of localization given that 439 clusters consistently showed the presence of myosin II and either septin2 or anillin . In terms of 440 physical parameters , the small clusters in early cortices were spaced an average of 2 . 7 µm apart 441 ( Figure 6N ) and averaged 586 nm 2 in area ( Figure 6O ) , with these measurements not being 442 significantly different in clusters stained with any of the three antibody combinations . This lack 443 of difference is important because it provides assurance that the clusters identified with the three 444 different antibody combinations are the same structures . In terms of comparing the physical 445 parameters of the sea urchin embryo clusters to the nodes that initiate cytokinesis in fission yeast , 446 the sea urchin clusters are larger and more widely spaced as would be expected given the large 15 447 difference in size between the two cells . In fission yeast nodes are ~ 500 - 700 nm apart and 448 average ~ 100 - 200 nm in diameter ( Wu et al . , 2006 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Laplante et al . , 2016 ) . 449 450 Super - resolution microscopy demonstrates the organization of myosin II , anillin and 451 septin2 in the mature CR and provides evidence of a septin filament network 452 In isolated cortices containing mature CRs 3D - SIM imaging demonstrated that the pattern of 453 myosin II labeling was linearized with an alignment of chains of head - to - head associated myosin 454 II filaments ( Figure 8A - D ) , as we have previously reported ( Henson et al . , 2017 ) . In contrast , 455 septin2 staining was organized into a honeycomb pattern network that was closely associated 456 with P - MyoRLC staining ( Figure 8E - H ) . The septin2 staining within the network was frequently 457 discontinuous / periodic which may be the result of the septin2 antibody binding to only one of the 458 septin isoforms within the linear structure of a heteropolymer . The overall network pattern of 459 septin2 within the CR appeared similar to the gauze - like organization of septin filaments that has 460 been reported in vitro ( Bertin et al . , 2010 ; Garcia et al . , 2011 ) and in vivo in other cell types 461 ( Rodal et al . , 2005 ; Bertin et al . , 2012 ; Dolat et al . , 2014 ) . One criticism of 3D - SIM microscopy 462 is that the structured illumination itself and / or the associated post - acquisition processing can 463 create a honeycomb pattern artifact in the images ( Demmerle et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore , in order to 464 corroborate the septin2 network staining seen using 3D - SIM , we imaged cortices with STED 465 microscopy , a higher resolution form of super - resolution microscopy ( Schermelleh et al . , 2010 ) 466 that does not suffer from this type of artifact . STED images of cortices also showed clear 467 examples of a septin2 filament network in the CR intimately affiliated with myosin II ( Figure 8I - 468 L ; 9A - C ) . We believe that our 3D - SIM and STED images provide the first definitive 469 visualization of septin filament higher order structure in the CR of an animal cell . 470 471 Figure 8 . 3D - SIM and STED super - resolution imaging of myosin II , septin2 and anillin in late stage CRs in 472 isolated cortices .

( M - U ) Anillin ( cyan ) and P - MyoRLC ( magenta ) staining of a mature 476 CR indicates that anillin is more punctate in distribution and in close proximity to myosin II ( M - P ) . The cortex in 477 Q - V is highly contracted ( Q shows a low magnification confocal view ) and in this CR remnant the STED imaging of 478 anillin appears similar to a network .

Insets in A - C show lower magnification confocal images of 485 the cortices with the regions imaged by STED outlined by a white rectangle . Bar = 5 µm ; magnifications of A - C are 486 equivalent . 487 488 Imaging of anillin stained mature stage CRs in cortices with 3D - SIM ( Figure 8M - P ) showed 489 that unlike septin2 , the anillin pattern often appeared less interconnected and more punctate , 490 although it was also closely co - distributed with the myosin II head probe staining in the CR 491 region . In late stage , highly contracted CRs , STED imaging suggested that the anillin pattern 492 appeared to become more network - like ( Figure 8Q - U ) . 493 494 Actin filaments are not required for septin2 or anillin recruitment to early CR clusters 495 Our previous work ( Henson et al . , 2017 ) and an earlier study from other investigators ( Foe 496 and van Dassow , 2008 ) have shown that treatment of sea urchin embryos with the actin filament 497 disrupting drugs Latrunculin A or B does not disrupt the ability of myosin II to form clusters in 498 the CR region during telophase . Latrunculin treated embryos do not divide and do not display the 499 linearized pattern of aligned myosin II seen in control embryos ( Henson et al . , 2017 ) . In order to 500 test the actin dependence of septin2 or anillin localization to CR clusters we treated embryos 501 with either LatA or LatB and then fixed and stained embryos and isolated cortices for P - 502 MyoRLC and either septin2 or anillin at time points consistent with the timing of first division 503 telophase in matched control embryos . We also monitored karyokinesis in these Lat treated 504 embryos as this process is not inhibited by actin filament disruption . In both whole embryos 505 ( Figure 10A - C , G - I ) and isolated cortices ( Figure 10D - F , J - L ) we saw evidence of an association 506 between P - MyoRLC and septin2 ( Figure 10A - F ) or anillin ( Figure 10G - L ) in band - like arrays of 507 clusters reminiscent of the early CR ( Figures 4 - 6 ) . Localization of nuclei in whole embryos 508 indicated that they had undergone nuclear division ( Figure 10C , I ) . 509 510 Figure 10 .

As Glotzer ( 2017 ) pointed out in a recent review on cytokinesis , the 525 structural organization of the metazoan CR remains poorly understood due to the rapid 526 rearrangements and dense collections of filaments involved which make it difficult to resolve 527 using conventional light microscopy . In our previous work ( Henson et al . , 2017 ) we have 528 addressed these limitations by leveraging the advantage of the sea urchin embryo isolated cortex 529 experimental system combined with super - resolution light microscopy and platinum replica 530 TEM . Our results suggested that the CR assembles from an equatorial band of myosin II clusters 531 that coalesce into a linearized arrangement of end - to - end myosin II filaments in the mature CR . 532 Note that we are confident that the cortex isolation process itself does not induce these myosin II 533 clusters as our imaging of whole embryos ( Figure 3 ) and previously published work ( Foe and 534 von Dassow , 2008 ) have also indicated that clusters of myosin II are present in the CR . In the 535 present study , we confirm and extend our recent work by once again using isolated cortices 536 combined with super - resolution microscopy to explore the nanostructural organization and 537 dynamics of the major CR scaffolding proteins anillin and septin . 538 539 Anillin localization in the embryo CR highlights its potential scaffold functions 540 Since its initial discovery in Drosophila embryos ( Field and Alberts , 1995 ) , anillin is a 541 protein that has been shown to localize to the animal cell cleavage furrow ( Oegema et al . , 2000 ; 542 Maddox et al . , 2005 ; Straight et al . , 2005 ; Zhao and Fang , 2005 ) , and functional studies have 543 demonstrated that anillin is required for cytokinesis and serves as an essential scaffolding protein 544 that links RhoA , the membrane , actin , myosin II , formin and septins ( Oegema et al . , 2000 ; Field 18 545 et al . , 2005 ; Maddox et al . , 2005 ; Straight et al . , 2005 ; Maddox et al . , 2007 ; Piekny and Glotzer , 546 2008 ; Liu et al . , 2012 ; Renshaw et al . , 2014 ) . Despite a great deal of attention given to the 547 structure and function of anillin ( Piekny and Maddox , 2010 ) , the precise localization of anillin 548 within the CR is not clear in animal cells , although it is well - defined in fission yeast . In these 549 cells , the anillin - like protein Mid1 is localized in the nucleus , but upon entry into mitosis , it 550 relocates to the cell surface around the nucleus , where it forms a number of small nodes ( Bahler 551 et al . , 1998 ) . Mid1 recruits the CR components myosin II ( Myo2 ) and the formin Cdc12 552 ( Laplante et al . , 2016 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ) . Actin filaments nucleated from the nodes via formin 553 activity are then captured by myosin II that in turn pulls the nodes together into a CR - like 554 structure ( Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Laplante et al . , 2016 ; Glotzer , 2017 ) . 555 In the present study , we investigated anillin localization in the sea urchin embryo CR by first 556 characterizing the specificity of an antibody raised against the PH domain of sea urchin anillin 557 by confirming its appropriate immunoreactivity in immunoblotting and predicted localization in 558 the nuclei of interphase cells ( Figure 1 ) . In whole embryos we show that sea urchin anillin is 559 associated with the cleavage furrow in the expected orientation relative to the mitotic apparatus 560 ( Figure 2 ) and that it colocalizes with the CR marker activated myosin II , P - MyoRLC ( Figure 3 ) . 561 In cortices isolated from first division embryos , conventional imaging revealed that anillin 562 associates with myosin II initially in clusters / nodes that then progress to narrower , more 563 linearized arrays in more mature CRs ( Figure 4 ; 5 ) . Super - resolution imaging emphasized the 564 close association between anillin and myosin II within the early stage clusters ( Figure 6 ; 7 ) , with 565 anillin often displaying a C or O - shaped structure in cluster centers , as well as the possibility 566 suggested from Z axial images that anillin resides closer to the membrane relative to myosin II 567 head groups . The fact that anillin localizes to the CR region in clusters independent of actin 568 filaments ( Figure 10 ) is consistent with previous work in Drosophila S2 cells ( Hickson and 569 O’Farrel , 2008 ) , but inconsistent with results from BHK - 21 mammalian cells ( Oegema et al . , 570 2000 ) . 571 Our anillin localization results are in general agreement with previous fPALM super - 572 resolution imaging of fission yeast nodes ( Laplante et al . , 2016 ) and mature CRs ( McDonald et 573 al . , 2017 ) which suggest that the anillin - like Mid1 resides in the center of nodes and nearest the 574 membrane relative to other node / CR proteins . Higher order anillin structures in sea urchin CRs 575 are suggested by 3D - SIM images of late stage CRs where anillin on occasion appears reticular 19 576 ( Figure 8 ) . Earlier work has hinted at organized staining patterns for anillin in the CR , to include 577 the punctate distribution of anillin along actin cables in the cleavage furrow of BHK cells 578 ( Oegema et al . , 2000 ) , the presence of patches or filaments containing anillin and myosin II in 579 the CR of HeLa cells either untreated or arrested in cytokinesis by blebbistatin treatment 580 ( Straight et al . , 2003 ; 2005 ) , and the presence of combined anillin and septin rings in the 581 intercellular bridge region of late stage dividing HeLa cells ( Renshaw et al . , 2014 ) . 582 It is important to note that the predicted multi - domain nature of sea urchin anillin ( Figure 1A ) 583 is supported by our ability to colocalize this protein with structures in the CR containing its 584 expected binding partners – namely myosin II , actin , septin , and RhoA ( Figure 3 - 8 ) . This 585 localization pattern provides strong circumstantial evidence that anillin is playing its expected 586 role as an integrating scaffold in the sea urchin CR . We speculate that anillin recruitment via 587 RhoA activated from the astral microtubule trafficked centralspindlin complex ( Argiros et al . , 588 2012 ) is the initial event in the establishment of the clusters that initiate the process of CR 589 formation . 590 591 Septin2 localization in the sea urchin embryo CR demonstrates higher order structure 592 Septins are a family of G proteins first discovered in yeast ( Hartwell , 1971 ) that can combine 593 into hetero - oligomeric filaments which consist of different isoforms in different species , and 594 which play important roles in cell polarity , membrane remodeling , morphogenesis , exocytosis , 595 and cytokinesis ( Bridges and Gladfelter , 2015 ; Marquardt et al . , 2019 ) . Septins have long known 596 to be associated with the CR in many different cell types ( Bridges and Gladfelter , 2015 ) and 597 septin2 in particular has been shown to bind to myosin II and facilitate the myosin II activation 598 required for cytokinesis ( Joo et al . , 2007 ) . In the present study , we demonstrate that septin2 599 associates with myosin II , actin and anillin in clusters that appear to serve as the antecedent of 600 the CR ( Figure 4 - 9 ) . Within these clusters septin2 is more central than myosin II ( Figure 6 ; 7 ) , 601 in the same area as anillin , with XZ imaging suggesting little axial separation between septin2 602 and myosin II . In fission yeast CR precursor nodes do not contain septin ( Glotzer , 2017 ) , 603 although septin filaments are present in the mature CR ( McDonald et al . , 2017 ) and septin 604 filaments form characteristic hourglass and double ring structures in the CR - equivalent structure 605 in budding yeast ( Ong et al . , 2014 ) . Our 3D - SIM and STED images indicate the presence of 606 elongate septin2 filaments associated with enlarging clusters and with the mature CR ( Figure 6 - 20 607 9 ) . These septin2 filaments associate with but do not precisely colocalize with myosin II staining 608 and frequently display periodic labeling , as might be expected if the sept2 antibody is labeling 609 just one septin isoform within a hetero - oligomer . In some images the septin2 staining is elongate 610 ( Figure 6 ; 8 ; 9 ) which may represent the ability of short septin filaments to diffuse in the 611 membrane and anneal into longer filaments via end - to - end associations as has been demonstrated 612 in vitro on phospholipid bilayers and in vivo in fungi ( Bridges et al . , 2014 ) . The ability of septin2 613 to localize to the CR region independent of actin filaments ( Figure 10 ) is similar to the results 614 reported for the septin Pnut in LatA - treated Drosophila S2 cells ( Hickson and O’Farrell , 2008 ) . 615 The higher order structural organization of septin2 filaments present in mature stage CRs of 616 sea urchin embryos appears to be a reticular network with an overall honeycomb pattern which is 617 closely associated with the distribution of myosin II ( Figure 8 ; 9 ) . The imaging does not allow 618 for a distinction between an interconnected network of filaments versus an array of separate 619 filaments in an overlapping organization . However , this septin2 network is similar to the gauze - 620 like septin filament structures that have been previously reported in vitro using negative stain 621 TEM ( Garcia et al . , 2011 ; Bertin et al . , 2010 ) and in vivo associated with the cortex of budding 622 yeast using platinum replica TEM ( Rodal et al . , 2005 ) and TEM tomography ( Bertin et al . , 623 2012 ) , and associated with the interface of transverse and dorsal stress fibers in the leading 624 lamella of migrating mammalian epithelial cells using SIM ( Dolat et al . , 2014 ) . Prior work with 625 dividing mammalian tissue culture cells has shown filamentous septin staining codistributed with 626 CR actin cables ( Oegema et al . , 2000 ) and septin rings in the midbody at the end of cytokinesis 627 ( Renshaw et al . , 2014 ) . However , we believe that our super - resolution images provide the first 628 visualization of a clearly defined septin filament higher order organization in the CR of an 629 animal cell . 630 631 Clusters of myosin II , anillin and septin initiate the sea urchin embryo CR 632 Our results suggest that an equatorial band of cortical clusters of myosin II , septin2 and 633 anillin help serve as a precursor for the formation of the CR in first division sea urchin embryos . 634 Earlier work in C . elegans embryos ( Maddox et al . , 2005 ; 2008 ) and in Drosophila S2 cultured 635 cells ( Hickson and O’Farrell , 2008 ) have indicated that clusters of these same three proteins are 636 also involved in the cytokinesis process , although these clusters are not completely analogous to 637 our results and the imaging employed is significantly lower resolution . In C . elegans the anillin 21 638 homologue ANI - 1 is required for the cortical ruffling and pseudocleavage that proceed 639 cytokinesis as well as for asymmetric cleavage patterns during cytokinesis , although CR closure 640 can occur in the absence of ANI - 1 ( Maddox et al . , 2005 ; 2007 ) . In addition , ANI - 1 targets 641 independently to the CR and helps direct septins , but not myosin II , there as well . In contrast 642 with the equatorial band of clusters we demonstrate in the sea urchin embryo , the clusters in C . 643 elegans appear distributed throughout the entire cortex of the embryo during ruffling , although 644 clusters of myosin II do appear in the CR region during cytokinesis ( Osório et al . , 2019 ) . In S2 645 cells the CR localization of anillin is independent of actin and myosin II , its absence causes 646 destabilization of the position of the cleavage furrow , and aggregates of myosin II , anillin and 647 septin in the CR only become obvious upon treatment of dividing cells with Latrunculin 648 ( Hickson and O’Farrell , 2008 ) . These aggregates can appear filamentous with myosin II and 649 anillin staining appearing in the same place but slightly offset ( Hickson and O’Farrell , 2008 ) , 650 reminiscent of what we demonstrate in our SIM images of anillin and myosin II staining of 651 clusters . In general , it appears that the cytokinetic myosin II , anillin and septin clusters in C . 652 elegans embryos and in Drosophila S2 cells are loosely analogous with those we demonstrate in 653 the sea urchin embryo . However , the differences outlined above , the superior spatial resolution 654 of the architecture of clusters we provide , as well as the strong evidence of the transformation of 655 the sea urchin clusters into patches and linearized arrays makes it difficult to make more direct 656 comparisons . 657 658 A working conceptual model for how the CR is built in the early sea urchin embryo 659 Our current conceptual model of CR formation in the first division sea urchin embryo 660 employs the following hypothetical framework as informed by the results of our present study . 661 At late anaphase the astral microtubule - dependent activation of Rho via the action of 662 centralspindlin / RhoGEF helps trigger the recruitment of anillin , myosin II and septin to the CR 663 precursor clusters ( Figures 4 - 7 ) , which is facilitated by the ability of these three CR components 664 to bind to one another . Within the clusters anillin and septin occupy a central core ( Figures 6 ; 7 ) 665 and would be expected to interact with the membrane and bind with the tails of myosin II 666 filaments . Actin filaments are not necessary for the recruitment of myosin II ( Foe and von 667 Dassow , 2008 ; Henson et al . , 2017 ) , septin ( Figure 10 ) or anillin ( Figure 10 ) to the CR region in 668 sea urchin embryos and research in other cell types suggests that anillin recruitment is 22 669 independent of myosin II , whereas septin recruitment is dependent on anillin ( Maddox et al . , 670 2005 ; 2007 ; Hickson and O’Farrell , 2008 ) . As noted earlier , the sea urchin clusters share some 671 gross similarities with the organization of clusters of these proteins in dividing C . elegans 672 embryos and Drosophila S2 cells as well as the nodes seen in fission yeast undergoing 673 cytokinesis . However , the yeast nodes do not contain septin and the orientation of the myosin II 674 filaments in our images suggests a mini - filament chain organization instead of the bouquets of 675 individual myosin II proteins defined by fPALM imaging of yeast nodes ( Laplante et al . , 2016 ) . 676 Over time the sea urchin clusters enlarge with myosin II forming head - to - head filament arrays 677 oriented parallel to the plane of the membrane via interaction with actin filaments , septin 678 filaments elongating via annealing with other septin oligomers ( Bridges et al . , 2014 ) , and the 679 anillin array also expanding ( Figure 6 ; 7 ) . In fission yeast node - associated formins nucleate actin 680 filaments which then are used by node - associated myosin II to move nodes towards the forming 681 CR ( Valvylonis et al . , 2008 ) . Actin filaments do associate with the sea urchin clusters ( Figure 682 5 ) , however the distribution of formin has not been established in our system . Coincident with 683 cluster enlargement these structures tend to interconnect and coalesce into a narrower and denser 684 linear array in which the interaction of myosin II with elongate actin filaments causes them to 685 become aligned parallel with the axis of the cleavage furrow ( Figure 5 ; 8 ) , septin filaments 686 organize into a network ( Figure 8 ; 9 ) , whereas anillin tends to remain in more punctate arrays 687 until late in cleavage where they also appear to form a network ( Figure 8 ) . 688 Within the context of the mature CR , septin and anillin can be considered to be functioning as 689 scaffold and anchoring proteins although they also may engage in other critical roles . For 690 example , septins may be contributing to the full activation of myosin II by serving as a platform 691 for myosin II and its activating kinases ( Joo et al . , 2007 ) , and / or they may be essential for the 692 curvature and bundling of the actin filaments in the CR ( Mavrakis et al . , 2014 ; Bridges and 693 Gladfelter , 2015 ) . In the sea urchin embryo septin and anillin remain in the CR through the 694 midbody stage ( Figure 2 , 3 ) and therefore may be expected to play a role in the maturation of the 695 CR to the midbody ring and subsequent abscission given the evidence that they participate in this 696 critical step in other cells ( Etsey et al . , 2010 ; Kechad et al . , 2012 ; El Amine et al . , 2013 ; 697 Renshaw et al . , 2014 ; Karasmanis et al . , 2019 ) . In a recent interesting hypothesis paper , Carim et 698 al . ( 2020 ) argue that anillin is critical for the organization of two Rho - dependent sub - networks 699 during cytokinesis : the acto - myosin sub - network driven by functionality associated with anillin’s 23 700 N terminus and the anillo - septin sub - network dependent on anillin’s C terminus . The anillin 701 localization patterns that we demonstrate in the present study would appear to be consistent with 702 this potential central organizing role for anillin . 703 704 In conclusion , the results of the present study suggest that CR generation in sea urchin 705 embryos may be an evolutionary derivative of the process in fission yeast , with both mechanisms 706 relying on initiation via clusters / nodes of crucial cytokinetic proteins , including myosin II , 707 anillin , actin , and , in the sea urchin , septin . In order to further explore this evolutionary 708 relationship and to address the many questions raised by our conceptual model , we are currently 709 pursuing a number of new experimental directions . These include CR imaging approaches in 710 live embryos to more closely examine dynamics , investigations into the role of formins in CR 711 formation , and development of agent - based computer modeling of cytokinesis informed by our 712 microscopy - based studies . 713 714 Acknowledgements 715 Grateful thanks are extended to Dr .
