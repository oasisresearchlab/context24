However , these clinical diagnostic tests cannot predict the response to therapy . Single molecule imaging approaches can quantify molecular features of HER2 , such as receptor nano - organization , with exquisite spatial resolution and sensitivity . The aim of our study was to assess how the molecular features of HER2 varied with the therapy response . According to our results in cultured cell lines and six patient specimens , the therapy response was associated with high detected HER2 densities and clustering . This advanced imaging approach can thus provide key data to complement the current diagnostic standards . Abstract : Trastuzumab , the prototype HER2 - directed therapy , has markedly improved survival for women with HER2 - positive breast cancers . However , only 40 – 60 % of women with HER2 - positive breast cancers achieve a complete pathological response to chemotherapy combined with HER2 - directed therapy . The current diagnostic assays have poor positive - predictive accuracy in identifying therapy - responsive breast cancers . Here , we deployed quantitative single molecule localization microscopy to assess the molecular features of HER2 in a therapy - responsive setting . Using ﬂuorescently labeled trastuzumab as a probe , we ﬁrst compared the molecular features of HER2 in trastuzumab - sensitive ( BT - 474 and SK - BR - 3 ) and trastuzumab - resistant ( BT - 474 R and JIMT - 1 ) cultured cell lines . Trastuzumab - sensitive cells had signiﬁcantly higher detected HER2 densities and clustering . We then evaluated HER2 in pre - treatment core biopsies from women with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy . A complete pathological response was associated with a high detected HER2 density and signiﬁcant HER2 clustering . These results established the nano - organization of HER2 as a potential signature of therapy - responsive disease . Keywords : super - resolution microscopy ; breast cancer ; trastuzumab ; therapy response ; HER2 ; clustering 1 . Background The survival of women with HER2 - positive breast cancer has been dramatically im - proved with the advancement of trastuzumab therapy [ 1 – 3 ] . Today , the ﬁrst - line therapy Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / cancers14112795 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / cancers Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 2 of 20 regimen includes chemotherapy combined with HER2 - directed therapy , monoclonal an - tibodies ( mAbs ) trastuzumab and pertuzumab . Eligibility for HER2 - directed therapy is currently evaluated using a set of guidelines , which are determined by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists ( ASCO ) and the College of American Pathologists ( CAP ) . Two assays are employed to assess the levels of HER2 in breast cancers : immunohistochem - istry ( IHC ) and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) [ 4 – 8 ] . IHC and FISH are highly accurate for predicting breast cancers that will not respond to HER2 - directed therapies ( negative - predictive marker ) [ 9 ] . However , IHC and FISH have poor positive - predictive accuracy . Only 40 – 60 % of women with HER2 - positive breast cancers will achieve a com - plete pathological response to standard regimens of chemotherapy combined with either trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab [ 10 – 19 ] . During 10 years of clinical follow - ups , approximately 20 % of women will either experience disease recurrence or succumb to disease [ 20 , 21 ] . A broad range of new therapies are being developed to target the HER - family of receptors . Since many options now exist , new assays are needed , not only to identify non - responders ( negative predictor ) , but also to identify who will beneﬁt with high positive - predictive accuracy . Trastuzumab was the ﬁrst mAb approved by the U . S . Food and Drug Administra - tion ( FDA ) to treat HER2 - postive breast cancers [ 22 , 23 ] . The efﬁcacy of this ﬁrst - line neoadjuvant therapy has been linked to four antitumor effects [ 24 – 29 ] : ( 1 ) the rapid inter - nalization and degradation of HER2 , ( 2 ) the disruption of HER2 homodimerization , ( 3 ) the inhibition of extracellular HER2 proteolytic cleavage , and ( 4 ) the stimulation of antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . The efﬁcacy of trastuzumab has led to several trastuzumab - based drug conjugates . Two FDA - approved conjugates , trastuzumab emtansine ( T - DM 1 ) and trastuzumab deruxtecan ( T - DXd ) , have shown improved antitu - mor properties and overall survival [ 17 , 30 – 32 ] . While trastuzumab - based therapies work by binding to domain IV of HER2 ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) , another FDA - approved anti - HER2 mAb , pertuzumab , targets domain II of HER2 ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . It not only inhibits HER2 heterodimerization but also blocks important mitogenic signaling cascades [ 33 , 34 ] . Altogether , these mAb - based HER2 - directed therapies have signiﬁcantly improved patient outcomes [ 1 , 2 , 33 , 35 – 43 ] . According to a recent phase 3 study ( 1196 patients from 25 countries ) , the 8 - year landmark overall survival rate for patients on chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab was 37 % , and for patients on chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab alone , it was 23 % [ 44 ] . Because ﬁrst - line treatment of HER2 - positive disease includes chemotherapy combined with HER2 - directed agents , one cannot distinguish whether the cancer is sensitive to chemotherapy or to the HER2 - directed therapy ; the combination is synergistic [ 2 ] . In patients who progressed on trastuzumab - containing therapy , continued trastuzumab with chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone , suggesting that synergy persists despite prior progression on the same HER2 - directed treatment [ 45 , 46 ] . To date , the mechanisms governing a poor response to HER2 - directed therapy are not fully understood , but cultured cell lines have offered important insights . A poor response to HER2 - directed therapy could be due to three properties of the HER2 receptor : ( 1 ) Receptor accessibility . Clinical mAbs cannot bind the truncated form of HER2 , p95HER2 , because it does not contain mAb - binding epitopes on the extracellular region [ 47 – 50 ] . Additionally , mAbs cannot bind to HER2 that is sterically occluded by large ( glyco ) proteins [ 51 , 52 ] . ( 2 ) Receptor heterogeneity . Breast tumors exhibit spatial ( cell - to - cell ) and temporal hetero - geneity , which can affect the response to HER2 - directed therapy [ 53 – 56 ] . In a fraction of cases , the HER2 status changes following neoadjuvant therapy [ 57 ] . ( 3 ) Receptor organiza - tion at the plasma membrane . HER2 forms both functional homodimers and heterodimers with a diverse array of receptors [ 58 – 72 ] . While homodimers of HER2 produce a weak downstream signal , HER2 heterodimers generate a strong signal [ 73 , 74 ] . Poor response to HER2 - directed therapy has been linked to the dysregulation of signaling pathways downstream from the HER2 receptor . First are alterations to the PTEN - PI3K / AKT and MEK / ERK [ 75 – 78 ] pathways ; these pathways regulate processes such as Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 3 of 20 apoptosis , metabolism , cell proliferation , and cell growth . The second is a decrease in the levels of the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27 [ 79 ] ; p27 regulates cell proliferation , cell motility , and apoptosis . Additionally , an upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases can , in turn , alter HER2 signaling [ 62 , 63 , 65 , 71 , 80 – 86 ] . Recently , these downstream signaling pathways appeared to be impacted by the nano - organization of HER2 along the plasma membrane . Signiﬁcant clustering of HER2 on the plasma membrane can lead to ( biologic agent - induced ) inactivation of receptors or the rapid internalization and degradation of receptors [ 87 – 90 ] . Consistently , upon crosslinking , the endocytosis of HER2 from the plasma membrane is increased in trastuzumab - sensitive SK - BR - 3 and BT - 474 cells , but not in trastuzumab - resistant BT - 474 R cells [ 91 ] . Although HER2 - directed therapy has increased overall patient survival , there still re - mains a major challenge in treating HER2 - positive breast cancers . Clinical HER2 assays can - not accurately identify which HER2 - positive breast cancers will respond to therapy [ 10 – 17 ] . Recent research , enabled by emerging techniques , has revealed the importance of the molecular distribution of receptors on the cellular plasma membrane ; the receptor nano - organization may govern downstream signaling processes and , ultimately , cellular function . One strategy to deﬁne the receptor nano - organization is via a ﬂuorescence - based super - resolution microscopy approach called quantitative single molecule localization microscopy ( qSMLM ) . It is particularly relevant to HER2 - positive breast cancer : qSMLM can count plasma membrane - localized receptors , report on the nano - organization of these receptors , and deﬁne their nano - scale heterogeneity . Several studies in cultured cell lines and pa - tient tissues have applied various super - resolution microscopy techniques to assess the HER2 protein distribution and copy number [ 92 – 95 ] . Previously , we observed signiﬁcant changes in HER2 patterning when cultured cells were treated with chemotherapeutic agents [ 96 ] . We also used this approach to quantitatively assess HER2 in patient tissues [ 97 ] . Here , we extend this qSMLM approach by assessing HER2 in both therapy - sensitive and - resistant settings . Using qSMLM , we ﬁrst probed signatures associated with trastuzumab resistance in four cultured cell lines . Using trastuzumab and pertuzumab as ﬂuorescent probes , we assessed the detected HER2 density and nano - organization . Next , we used touch prep - qSMLM [ 97 ] to assess plasma membrane - localized HER2 in core biopsies from six women with breast cancer prior to a neoadjuvant treatment that included chemotherapy , trastuzumab , and pertuzumab . In cultured cell lines and patient samples , both the detected HER2 density and clustering appeared to be important for therapy sensitivity / response . 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Coverslip Cleaning First , 25 mm diameter coverslips ( Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc , Cat # NC9560650 , Waltham , MA , USA ) were cleaned as previously described [ 98 ] . Cleaned coverslips were stored in sterile 35 × 10 mm dishes ( Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc , Cat # 153066 ) and wrapped in alu - minum foil until used for cell culture or touch prep . 2 . 2 . Cell Culture BT - 474 , BT - 474 clone 5 [ 99 ] , and SK - BR - 3 cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Man - assas , VA , USA ) and JIMT - 1 ( AddexBio , San Diego , CA , USA ) were cultured at 37 ◦ C and 5 % CO 2 in phenol - red - free DMEM ( Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc , Cat # 3105303 ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( VWR , Cat # 97068 - 091 , Radnor , PA , USA ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Invitrogen , Cat # 11360070 , Waltham , MA , USA ) , and 4 mM GlutaMAX ( Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc , Cat # 35050061 ) . For imaging experiments , approximately 250 , 000 cells were seeded on coverslips previously coated with human ﬁbronectin protein ( 50 µ g / mL ﬁnal concentration , R & D systems , Cat # 1918 - FN - 02M , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) . Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 4 of 20 2 . 3 . Antibodies and Fluorescent Dye Conjugation Trastuzumab and pertuzumab ( Genentech ) were used for staining the extracellular domains of HER2 . Anti - cytokeratin 7 ( Abcam , Cat # ab181598 , Cambridge , UK ) and goat anti - rabbit ( Abcam , Cat # ab6702 ) were used to detect epithelial cells . Trastuzumab and pertuzumab were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 ( AF647 , Invitrogen , Cat # A20006 ) , and goat anti - rabbit was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 405 ( AF405 , Invitrogen Cat # A30000 ) using previously published methods [ 97 ] . According to NanoDrop measurements , in all cases approximately one dye per antibody ( degree of labeling ~ 1 ) was obtained for trastuzumab and pertuzumab . 2 . 4 . Photophysical Characterization of Fluorescent Probes To determine the photophysical properties of the ﬂuorescent probes ( maximum dark time and the average number of localizations per ﬂuorescent probe ) , we used a surface assay for molecular isolation ( SAMI ) [ 96 ] . Surfaces with sparse trastuzumab - or pertuzumab - AF647 were imaged immediately in dSTORM imaging buffer [ 100 ] . 2 . 5 . Flow Cytometry in Cultured Cell Lines Cells were grown to ~ 90 % conﬂuency and harvested by trypsinization . After washing , a total of 3 × 10 5 cells were incubated by rotation for 30 min at 4 ◦ C with trastuzumab - AF647 using a ﬁxed concentration of 10 µ g / mL . The same procedure was also applied for untreated cells to evaluate the background ﬂuorescence signal ; AF647 - conjugated goat anti - human IgG was used as a negative control . Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 264 × g for 5 min , washed three times , and resuspended in 200 µ L of buffer ( PBS 2 % BSA ) . Experiments were run on an LSRII FortessaX20 Analytical Cytometer where a minimum of 10 , 000 events were recorded for each sample in triplicate . The data were then analyzed using FlowJo TM v10 Software . 2 . 6 . Immunoﬂuorescence Staining of Cultured Cells Following a two - day seed on coverslips , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % ( w / v ) paraformalde - hyde and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) glutaraldehyde ( EMS , Cat # 157 - 8 and 16019 , respectively , Hatﬁeld , MA , USA ) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . Fixation was then quenched with 25 mM glycine in PBS for 10 min followed by three washes with blocking buffer ( BB , 5 % bovine serum albumin ( RPI , Cat # A30075 - 100 . 0 , Mount Prospect , IL , USA ) and 0 . 02 % Tween - 20 ( G - Biosciences , Cat # DG011 , St . Louis , MO , USA ) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature . Cells were then incubated with 50 nM trastuzumab - AF647 or pertuzumab - AF647 , diluted in BB , for 1 h at room temperature and covered from light . Following staining , cells were washed twice with BB , four times with PBS , and post - ﬁxed with 4 % ( w / v ) paraformalde - hyde and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature . Fixation was quenched using 25 mM glycine in PBS for 10 min at room temperature . Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 0 . 1 µ m TetraSpeck microspheres ( Invitrogen , Cat # T7279 ) in PBS for 5 min . Coverslips were placed in Attoﬂuor cell chambers and imaged immediately in dSTORM imaging buffer [ 100 ] . . 2 . 7 . Human Subjects and Core Biopsy Collection Tissue samples were collected under City of Hope ( COH ) Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) number 16079 . Dedicated core needle biopsies were performed by a radiologist under ultrasound guidance prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy . Immediately following collection , the tissue was transferred to a pathologist ( DS ) for cell collection , which was performed in the radiology suite . Portions of the tissue that were grossly consistent with carcinoma were identiﬁed and were separated from , e . g . , blood clot . The tissue was lightly touched to sterile gauze to dry it , and touch prep was accomplished by gently holding the biopsy material with a forceps and dabbing the tissue against the coverslip multiple times . Multiple portions of tissue ( at least two ) were sampled for each biopsy specimen . Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 5 of 20 2 . 8 . Tissue Touch Prep and Immunoﬂuorescence Staining Cleaned coverslips were incubated with 100 µ L of poly - L - lysine solution ( Millipore Sigma , Cat # P4707 ) for 15 min , washed three times with sterile DI water , and dried at room temperature for 10 min . Core biopsy tissue was dabbed several times on coverslips to leave behind a layer of cells . The monolayer left behind on the coverslip was allowed to incubate on the coverslips for 5 min to facilitate adhesion before the addition of any liquids . The sample was then ﬁxed with 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . Fixation was quenched with 25 mM glycine in PBS for 10 min , followed by three washes with BB ( however , tissue BB was supplemented with 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 instead of the 0 . 02 % used with the cultured cell lines ) . The tissue was then incubated with BB for 20 min at room temperature . After blocking , the tissue samples were incubated with 50 nM trastuzumab - AF647 and 2 µ g / mL anti - cytokeratin 7 Ab , diluted in BB , for 1 h at room temperature , covered from light . Following primary antibody incubation , the tissue was washed with BB and incubated with 2 µ g / mL goat anti - rabbit - AF405 for 45 min at room temperature . The tissue was washed twice with BB and four times with PBS . Then , it was postﬁxed with 4 % ( w / v ) paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min , followed by quenching with 25 mM glycine in PBS for 10 min at room temperature . The samples were imaged immediately using dSTORM imaging buffer [ 100 ] . 2 . 9 . dSTORM Setup and Image Acquisition For patient biopsy samples , imaging was performed on a 3D N - STORM super - resolution microscope ( Nikon , Minato City , Tokyo , Japan ) , consisting of a Ti - E inverted microscope with an E - TIRF illuminator and a Piezo Z stage on a vibration isolation table . This N - STORM system was equipped with a CFI 100XH oil objective Apo , TIRF , NA 1 . 49 , N - STORM and λ / 4 lenses , quad cube C - NSTORM ( Chroma , Cat # 97355 , Bellows Falls , VT , USA ) , a Perfect Focus System , an MLC - MBP - ND laser launch ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) , and an iXON Ultra DU - 897U EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology , Belfast , UK ) . For cultured cell lines , we used an upgraded N - STORM system with a Nikon Ti2 - E inverted microscope , Nikon N - STORM TIRF illuminator with a 2 × magniﬁcation lens , and Nikon LU - NF laser launch . The laser powers used from the Ti - E and Ti2 - E systems to excite the AF647 dyes were 140 mW and 89 mW , respectively , as measured out of the optical ﬁber . The laser power for the activation of AF405 dye was 5 – 10 mW , as measured out of the optical ﬁber . We acquired 60 , 000 frames for the cultured cell lines and 20 , 000 frames for the patient biopsy samples using an exposure of 10 ms . The data were acquired using NIS Elements software ( Nikon , Version 4 . 3 for Ti - E and 5 . 21 . 01 for Ti2 - E ) . 2 . 10 . Image Processing and Analysis Following image acquisition , the data were ﬁrst processed using NIS Elements to localize each molecule in each frame . The patient biopsy data were processed with a minimum height of the ﬂuorophore point spread function of 5000 and a minimum photons of 700 . For the cultured cell line data , these thresholds were set to 5000 and 1400 , respectively . The identiﬁcation settings for both datasets were as follows : 200 nm minimum peak width , 400 nm maximum peak width , 300 nm initial ﬁt width , 1 . 3 maximum axial ratio , and 1 - pixel maximum displacement . Additionally , the photons per count was set to 0 . 016 and 0 . 018 for the patient biopsy samples and cultured cell lines , respectively , based on the camera settings . The localization data were exported from the NIS Elements software into MATLAB ( MathWorks , Version 2021a ) for further processing . Fiducial beads were used to correct for the drift that occurred during imaging . For plotting the neighbors map for the cultured cell line data , a density ﬁlter was applied to remove the beads using the threshold of 100 counts in a radius of 60 nm . For the patient biopsy data , a density ﬁlter was applied to remove artiﬁcial clusters [ 101 ] with more than 50 counts in a radius of 70 nm . For both datasets , the lateral localization precision ( σ ) was calculated by NIS Elements based on Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 6 of 20 the photon distribution , and localizations with a precision larger than the 98th percentile were discarded . The localization density and clustering ( auto - correlation ) functions were computed using custom MATLAB code . Three to four square ROIs of 16 µ m 2 ( cultured cell lines ) or one to ﬁve square ROIs of 20 µ m 2 ( patient biopsy data ) were placed across cell areas to detect the total number of localizations . The number of localizations was divided by the average number of localizations per molecule , α , to obtain the detected number of molecules within each ROI . Within these ROIs , fast Fourier transform was used to compute the auto - correlation functions ( using PC analysis ) ; for clustered ROIs , the proteins per cluster and cluster radii were subsequently calculated [ 102 , 103 ] . For the same clustered ROIs , the fraction of clustered receptors and the number of clusters were quantiﬁed using a k - means - like clustering algorithm [ 96 , 97 ] . This algorithm uses the average σ , the cluster radius obtained from the PC analysis , and the maximum ﬂuorophore dark time to determine the fraction of receptors in clusters . If molecules met spatiotemporal requirements , they were counted as part of a cluster . For this clustering analysis , we report a cluster as containing more than two HER2 receptors ( to account for isolated HER2 homodimers ) . A neighbor counts map was determined by taking an individual localization and locating neighboring localizations within a 70 nm radius . 2 . 11 . Statistical Analysis A minimum of 14 cells were imaged for the cultured cell line data , and a minimum of 12 cells were imaged for the patient biopsy data . For the cultured cell line data , imaging was conducted in triplicate ( on three separate days ) . For the patient biopsy samples , we imaged at least two separate coverslips for each individual patient . All data in graphs are summarized by reporting mean values and SEM . p values were calculated for cultured cell lines and patient biopsy samples in Excel using a one - tailed Student’s t - test with a heteroscedastic two - sample unequal variance type . Additionally , to evaluate sampling , we randomly split all ROIs for a given output ( density , cluster radius , HER2 / cluster , the fraction of clustered HER2 , or the number of HER2 clusters / ROI ) into two groups and calculated the p values between the two groups ( p - value split ) . This was carried out using a randomization function followed by splitting and calculation by a two - tailed Student’s t - test with an unequal variance type in MATLAB . We ran this randomization and t - test ﬁve times and took the average for reporting . In all cases , no signiﬁcant difference was observed between the two groups ( p - value split ≥ 0 . 1 ) . For all data , we also calculated median , the coefﬁcients of variation ( the relative dispersion of detected densities around the mean value ) , kurtosis ( the measure of tailedness of the distribution that can identify if tails have extreme values ) , and skewness ( the measure of symmetry / asymmetry in the dataset ) using Graph Pad Prism 8 . All data for cultured cell lines are reported in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 , while the values for patient biopsies are provided in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Molecular Imaging of HER2 in Cultured Breast Cancer Cell Lines We assessed HER2 in cultured cell lines that express HER2 protein ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Using single molecule imaging , we compared the molecular features of plasma membrane - localized HER2 in two model systems . The ﬁrst comprised the HER2 - positive luminal B molecular subtype [ 104 ] , which is estrogen receptor ( ER ) - and / or progesterone receptor ( PR ) - positive . The second comprised the HER2 - enriched molecular subtype [ 104 ] , which is ER - negative and PR - negative . Our luminal B model system encompassed the trastuzumab - sensitive BT - 474 and trastuzumab - resistant BT - 474 clone 5 ( BT - 474 R ) cell lines . We purchased BT - 474 R from ATCC ; the cells were developed by culturing in the presence of trastuzumab until the emergence of resistant clones . This cell line exhibits enhanced phosphorylation of AKT and reduced nuclear expression of the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27 upon treatment with trastuzumab [ 99 ] . Our second model system Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 7 of 20 encompassed cell lines with a phenotype consistent with HER2 - enriched cells : trastuzumab - sensitive SK - BR - 3 and trastuzumab - resistant JIMT - 1 cells . Historically , JIMT - 1 cells were isolated from a patient who showed resistance to trastuzumab therapy . In this cell line , trastuzumab cannot efﬁciently bind to HER2 ; the epitope is masked by a bulky cell surface glycoprotein mucin - 4 [ 51 ] and / or the CD44 ligand hyaluronan [ 105 ] . In these four cell lines , we detected HER2 using two clinical antibodies , trastuzumab and pertuzumab . Each binds to different domains of extracellular HER2 ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Trastuzumab binds to domain IV and may inhibit ligand - independent HER2 homodimerization . Pertuzumab binds to domain II and can inhibit ligand - induced HER2 heterodimerization [ 106 , 107 ] . Performing independent studies with each antibody allowed us to assess two distinct HER2 pools . Using an optimized protocol [ 97 ] , we ﬂuorescently labeled the antibody with Alexa Fluor 647 ( AF647 ) dye . In all our experiments , the degree of labeling was approximately 1 ( Materials and Methods ) . We then used an established protocol ( surface assay for molecular isolation , SAMI ) [ 96 ] to assess the photophysical prop - erties of the ﬂuorescently labeled probes . For our imaging conditions , the average number of localizations per single ﬂuorescently labeled antibody ( trastuzumab or pertuzumab ) was 5 , and the maximum dark time was 300 s ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Prior to imaging , cultured cells were ﬁxed using a protocol that does not induce arti - facts but properly immobilizes proteins [ 102 , 108 ] . After the immunoﬂuorescence staining of cells , SMLM was employed to assess HER2 . Representative SMLM images ( Figure 1 ) show clear differences in the detected HER2 densities between the various cultured cell lines and ﬂuorescently labeled antibodies . The images were plotted using a neighbor counts map ( Materials and Methods ) to show the relative clustering of localizations . Purple color indicates no clustering of localizations , blue color indicates low clustering of localizations , and yellow color indicates high clustering of localizations . When trastuzumab was used as a probe ( representative images in Figure 1a , b , top ) , we visualized increased HER2 densities and clustering in the trastuzumab - sensitive cells ( BT - 474 and SK - BR - 3 ) compared to their respective trastuzumab - resistant cells ( BT - 474 R and JIMT - 1 ) . When pertuzumab was used as a probe ( representative images in Figure 1a , b , bottom ) , the HER2 densities and clustering between BT - 474 , BT474 R , and SK - BR - 3 cells visually did not show pronounced differences ; however , JIMT - 1 cells showed markedly reduced HER2 density . Supplementary Figure S4 includes the localization precision for this dataset . 3 . 2 . Quantitative SMLM in luminal B Cultured Breast Cancer Cell Lines We next analyzed SMLM imaging data in our luminal B model to quantify both the detected density of HER2 and its nano - organization . The detected density was determined by dividing the total number of localizations by the average number of localizations per ﬂuorescent probe [ 96 , 97 ] . The HER2 cluster radius and the number of HER2 molecules per cluster were determined for regions of interest ( ROIs ) with non - random ( clustered ) HER2 organization using the value for the average number of localizations per ﬂuorescent probe ( from SAMI ) and pair - correlation ( PC ) analysis [ 97 , 102 , 103 ] . For the same ROIs , we determined the number of HER2 clusters with more than two molecules and the fraction of HER2 molecules in those clusters relative to all detected HER2 molecules . To calculate these parameters , we used values for maximum dark time ( from SAMI ) , values for the average number of localizations per ﬂuorescent probe ( from SAMI ) , values for cluster size ( from PC analysis ) , and a k - means - like clustering algorithm [ 96 , 97 ] . This approach has been previously validated with a combination of cell line data and simulations [ 97 ] . Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 8 of 20 Cancers 2022 , 14 , x 8 of 21 Figure 1 .

HER2 was detected using trastuzumab - AF647 ( top ) or pertuzumab - AF647 ( bottom ) in HER2 - overexpressing breast cancer cells SK - BR - 3 ( trastuzumab - sensitive ) and JIMT - 1 ( trastuzumab - resistant ) .

Scale bars are 5 µm for full cells and 200 nm for insets . While the figure shows representative images , measurements were repeated three independent times , and 14 – 15 cells were imaged in each case . 3 . 2 . Quantitative SMLM in luminal B Cultured Breast Cancer Cell Lines . We next analyzed SMLM imaging data in our luminal B model to quantify both the detected density of HER2 and its nano - organization . The detected density was deter - mined by dividing the total number of localizations by the average number of localiza - tions per fluorescent probe [ 96 , 97 ] . The HER2 cluster radius and the number of HER2 molecules per cluster were determined for regions of interest ( ROIs ) with non - random ( clustered ) HER2 organization using the value for the average number of localizations per fluorescent probe ( from SAMI ) and pair - correlation ( PC ) analysis [ 97 , 102 , 103 ] . For the Figure 1 . SMLM images of HER2 detected in cultured breast cancer cell lines . ( a ) . HER2 was detected using trastuzumab - AF647 ( top ) or pertuzumab - AF647 ( bottom ) in luminal B breast cancer cells BT - 474 ( trastuzumab - sensitive ) and BT - 474 R ( trastuzumab - resistant ) . ( b ) . HER2 was detected using trastuzumab - AF647 ( top ) or pertuzumab - AF647 ( bottom ) in HER2 - overexpressing breast cancer cells SK - BR - 3 ( trastuzumab - sensitive ) and JIMT - 1 ( trastuzumab - resistant ) . The localizations are colored based on the number of neighboring localizations within 70 nm ( purple is least clustered and yellow is most clustered ) . Scale bars are 5 µ m for full cells and 200 nm for insets . While the ﬁgure shows representative images , measurements were repeated three independent times , and 14 – 15 cells were imaged in each case . Quantitative information on HER2 density and distribution at the plasma membrane was obtained from three independent measurements with sufﬁcient cell sampling ( in four cell lines , the p - value split [ 97 ] for all measured variables with both probes was above 0 . 1 ) . When trastuzumab was used as a probe , quantitative analysis of SMLM data revealed sub - stantial differences between trastuzumab - sensitive BT - 474 cells and trastuzumab - resistant BT - 474 R cells . The average detected HER2 density in BT - 474 cells was signiﬁcantly higher compared to BT - 474 R cells ( 221 vs . 182 molecules / µ m 2 , Figure 2a and Supplementary Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 9 of 20 Tables S1a and S2 ) ; BT - 474 cells also had a higher coefﬁcient of variation for the detected densities ( 43 vs . 28 % ) . Additionally , the two cell lines exhibited differences in HER2 nano - organization . While the cluster radii ( 17 . 1 and 16 . 3 nm ) and average number of HER2 molecules in a cluster ( 2 . 7 and 2 . 8 ) were similar between the two cell lines ( Figure 2b , c and Supplementary Tables S1a and S2 ) , both the number of HER2 clusters per ROI and the fraction of clustered HER2 molecules were signiﬁcantly higher in BT - 474 cells compared to BT - 474 R cells ( Figure 2d , e and Supplementary Tables S1a and S2 ) . On average , BT - 474 cells had 1264 clusters per ROI and 48 % of HER2 molecules were in these clusters ; BT - 474 R cells had 928 clusters per ROI and 44 % of HER2 molecules were in these clusters . Interest - ingly , when pertuzumab was used as a probe , we did not observe signiﬁcant differences between the two cell lines in terms of either detected HER2 densities or nano - organization ( Figure 2f – j and Supplementary Tables S1a and S2 ) . Accordingly , we observed substantial differences between trastuzumab and pertuzumab detection . In both cell lines , detection with pertuzumab resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower detected HER2 density , a smaller HER2 cluster radius , a lower fraction of clustered HER2 , and a smaller number of detected HER2 clusters ( Figure 2 and Supplementary Tables S1a and S2 ) . 3 . 3 . Quantitative SMLM in HER2 - Enriched Breast Cancer Cell Lines We then performed similar analyses in the HER2 - enriched model system , where we compared trastuzumab - sensitive SK - BR - 3 cells to trastuzumab - resistant JIMT - 1 cells . When trastuzumab was used as a probe , we observed signiﬁcant differences between the two cell lines in terms of the detected HER2 densities and nano - organization . Figure 3a and Supplementary Tables S1b and S2 illustrate a substantial difference in the average detected HER2 densities ( 181 vs . 22 molecules / µ m 2 ) ; the coefﬁcient of variation was higher in sensitive cells . Compared to JIMT - 1 cells , SK - BR - 3 cells , on average , had a signiﬁcantly higher cluster radius ( 17 . 4 vs . 14 . 9 nm ) , higher number of HER2 molecules in clusters ( 2 . 9 vs . 2 . 0 ) , higher fraction of clustered HER2 ( 52 vs . 36 % ) , and higher number of detected HER2 clusters per ROI ( 1222 vs . 117 ) ( Figure 3b – e and Supplementary Tables S1b and S2 ) . When pertuzumab was used as a probe , SK - BR - 3 cells also exhibited higher average detected HER2 densities ( 57 vs . 10 molecules / µ m 2 ) and a higher number of HER2 clusters per ROI ( 333 vs . 62 ) ( Figure 3f , j and Supplementary Tables S1b and S2 ) . De - tection with the pertuzumab probe yielded similar values for the cluster radius , num - ber of HER2 molecules in clusters , and fraction of clustered HER2 ( Figure 3g – i and Supplementary Tables S1b and S2 ) . According to these cumulative results , employing qSMLM with trastuzumab as the probe may provide signatures associated with trastuzumab sensitivity in cultured cell lines , namely , high HER2 density and clustering . 3 . 4 . Detected HER2 Density and Nano - Organization in Patient Tissue Specimens We hypothesized that the HER2 molecular features observed in cultured cell lines may also be present within patient specimens , thereby representing a potential signature of therapy response . We previously developed a touch prep - qSMLM [ 97 , 109 ] approach to rigorously assess the detected HER2 density and nano - organization in large areas of intact membranes from patient excisions . Importantly , the detected HER2 densities from qSMLM had a signiﬁcant positive correlation with the HER2 copy numbers from the clinical FISH assay [ 97 ] . Here , we extended the approach to core biopsy samples obtained prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy with docetaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab , and pertuzumab ( TCHP ) . This is the point in the treatment timeline where information regarding the response to therapy could inform subsequent therapeutic decisions . We assessed tumors from six women with breast cancer ; in one woman two tumor sites were sampled ( denoted here as S1 and S2 ) . At the time of biopsy , ﬁve breast cancers had IHC ( 3 + ) ; one breast cancer had negative FISH and IHC ( 2 + ) . The patient characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table S3 . Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 10 of 20 Cancers 2022 , 14 , x 9 of 21 same ROIs , we determined the number of HER2 clusters with more than two molecules and the fraction of HER2 molecules in those clusters relative to all detected HER2 mole - cules . To calculate these parameters , we used values for maximum dark time ( from SAMI ) , values for the average number of localizations per fluorescent probe ( from SAMI ) , values for cluster size ( from PC analysis ) , and a k - means - like clustering algorithm [ 96 , 97 ] . This approach has been previously validated with a combination of cell line data and sim - ulations [ 97 ] . Quantitative information on HER2 density and distribution at the plasma membrane was obtained from three independent measurements with sufficient cell sampling ( in four cell lines , the p - value split [ 97 ] for all measured variables with both probes was above 0 . 1 ) . When trastuzumab was used as a probe , quantitative analysis of SMLM data revealed substantial differences between trastuzumab - sensitive BT - 474 cells and trastuzumab - re - sistant BT - 474 R cells . The average detected HER2 density in BT - 474 cells was significantly higher compared to BT - 474 R cells ( 221 vs . 182 molecules / µm 2 , Figure 2a and Supplemen - tary Tables S1a and S2 ) ; BT - 474 cells also had a higher coefficient of variation for the de - tected densities ( 43 vs . 28 % ) . Additionally , the two cell lines exhibited differences in HER2 nano - organization . While the cluster radii ( 17 . 1 and 16 . 3 nm ) and average number of HER2 molecules in a cluster ( 2 . 7 and 2 . 8 ) were similar between the two cell lines ( Figure 2b , c and Supplementary Tables S1a and S2 ) , both the number of HER2 clusters per ROI and the fraction of clustered HER2 molecules were significantly higher in BT - 474 cells compared to BT - 474 R cells ( Figure 2d , e and Supplementary Tables S1a and S2 ) . On aver - age , BT - 474 cells had 1264 clusters per ROI and 48 % of HER2 molecules were in these clusters ; BT - 474 R cells had 928 clusters per ROI and 44 % of HER2 molecules were in these clusters . Interestingly , when pertuzumab was used as a probe , we did not observe signif - icant differences between the two cell lines in terms of either detected HER2 densities or nano - organization ( Figure 2f – j and Supplementary Tables S1a and S2 ) . Accordingly , we observed substantial differences between trastuzumab and pertuzumab detection . In both cell lines , detection with pertuzumab resulted in a significantly lower detected HER2 den - sity , a smaller HER2 cluster radius , a lower fraction of clustered HER2 , and a smaller number of detected HER2 clusters ( Figure 2 and Supplementary Tables S1a and S2 ) .

In total , 60 ROIs for BT - 474 and 60 ROIs for BT - 474 R were assessed . Clustering parameters were calculated based on 40 clustered ROIs for BT - 474 and 47 clustered ROIs for BT - 474 R cells .

The human breast cancer biopsy specimens used for qSMLM were collected as part of a COH IRB - approved trial ( IRB # 16079 ) examining the use of PET imaging to predict therapy response . Per the protocol , women were given one dose of radiolabeled trastuzumab prior to PET imaging . Several days later ( range = 1 – 14 days ) , the women underwent ultrasound - guided core biopsy under the care of a breast radiologist . Biopsy specimens were immediately transferred to a pathologist for cell collection to minimize the ischemic time . The portions of the biopsy material that were grossly consistent with carcinoma were identiﬁed and lightly touched to sterile gauze to dry the tissue . We then used a touch prep technique [ 110 ] to adhere monolayers of cancer cells from core biopsies to poly - L - lysine - coated coverslips . This was accomplished by gently holding the biopsy material with forceps and dabbing the tissue against the coverslip multiple times . At least two regions were taken from each biopsy sample . The samples were then immediately ﬁxed and incubated with trastuzumab - AF647 and an antibody against the epithelial marker , cytokeratin 7 , labeled with Alexa Fluor 405 . After analytical sample processing , the samples were immediately imaged . The cell morphology was assessed in brightﬁeld , and epithelial cells were distinguished from stromal cells [ 111 ] using the 405 nm signal . Trastuzumab - AF647 was then used in qSMLM to detect trastuzumab - accessible extracellular HER2 in epithelial cells . For each biopsy specimen , we calculated the detected HER2 density and nano - organization . A minimum of 12 cells were imaged , and sufﬁcient sampling was Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 11 of 20 conﬁrmed ( p - value split was above 0 . 1 for all variables , Supplementary Table S4 ) . At the time of surgery ( approximately 6 months following core biopsy collection and after all qSMLM data were computed ) , clinical outcomes and residual cancer burden ( RCB ) indices were noted . The RCB index ( RCB - 0 to RCB - III ) was designed to quantify residual disease in the tumor bed and lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy ; it is a well validated prognostic indicator for breast cancer [ 112 , 113 ] . Our sample cohort comprised the following : P18 had RCB - I , P20 had RCB - II , and all other women had achieved a pathological complete response ( pCR ) equivalent to RCB - 0 . Of note , P26 had residual ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) . Cancers 2022 , 14 , x 10 of 21 significantly higher detected density , fraction of HER2 molecules in clustered regions , and number of HER2 clusters per ROI .

We then performed similar analyses in the HER2 - enriched model system , where we compared trastuzumab - sensitive SK - BR - 3 cells to trastuzumab - resistant JIMT - 1 cells . When trastuzumab was used as a probe , we observed significant differences between the two cell lines in terms of the detected HER2 densities and nano - organization . Figure 3a and Supplementary Tables S1b and S2 illustrate a substantial difference in the average detected HER2 densities ( 181 vs . 22 molecules / µm 2 ) ; the coefficient of variation was higher in sensitive cells . Compared to JIMT - 1 cells , SK - BR - 3 cells , on average , had a significantly higher cluster radius ( 17 . 4 vs . 14 . 9 nm ) , higher number of HER2 molecules in clusters ( 2 . 9 vs . 2 . 0 ) , higher fraction of clustered HER2 ( 52 vs . 36 % ) , and higher number of detected HER2 clusters per ROI ( 1222 vs . 117 ) ( Figure 3b – e and Supplementary Tables S1b and S2 ) . When pertuzumab was used as a probe , SK - BR - 3 cells also exhibited higher average de - tected HER2 densities ( 57 vs . 10 molecules / µm 2 ) and a higher number of HER2 clusters per ROI ( 333 vs . 62 ) ( Figure 3f , j and Supplementary Tables S1b and S2 ) . Detection with the pertuzumab probe yielded similar values for the cluster radius , number of HER2 mol - ecules in clusters , and fraction of clustered HER2 ( Figure 3g – i and Supplementary Tables S1b and S2 ) . According to these cumulative results , employing qSMLM with trastuzumab as the probe may provide signatures associated with trastuzumab sensitivity in cultured cell lines , namely , high HER2 density and clustering .

A SMLM image for a biopsied HER2 - positive cancer cell is shown in Figure 4a . Repre - sentative SMLM images for each individual woman are shown in Supplementary Figure S5 . Although most cells had relatively uniform distributions of HER2 , a few ( e . g . , P21 and P26 , Supplementary Figure S5 ) had noticeable non - uniform densities . Interestingly , HER2 - enriched cell protrusions were also observed in some cells ( Figure 4a , indicated by arrows ) . This is consistent with previous reports of HER2 enrichment in membrane protrusions [ 114 ] . The average detected HER2 densities in these women ranged from 49 to 157 molecules / µ m 2 . The lowest values were observed in patients P18 ( RCB - I ) , P20 ( RCB - II ) , and P26 ( pCR with DCIS ) : 49 , 58 , and 59 molecules / µ m 2 , respectively ( Figure 4b and Supplementary Table S4 ) .

Of note , in P20 ( negative FISH and IHC 2 + ) we detected only 4 regions with HER2 clusters ; the remaining 54 regions had a random HER2 distribution . The average cluster radii ( Figure 4c and Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 ) varied between 18 nm and 38 nm . The number of molecules per cluster ( Figure 4d ) was slightly lower in women that did not achieve pCR : P18 ( RCB - I ) and P20 ( RCB - II ) had on average 2 . 3 and 1 . 8 molecules per cluster , respectively , whereas the other women had average values ranging between 2 . 6 and 3 . 8 molecules per cluster . The fraction of clustered HER2 molecules was signiﬁcantly reduced in patients P18 and P20 ( 33 and 31 % , respectively ) compared to the other women with pCR ( ranging from 54 to 73 % , Figure 4e ) . The number of HER2 clusters per ROI showed even more pronounced differences between women who did and did not achieve pCR ( Figure 4f ) . On average , P18 ( RCB - I ) had 199 clusters per ROI and P20 ( RCB - II ) had 118 clusters per ROI , while the women who achieved pCR had between 638 and 909 clusters per ROI . Therefore , both the detected HER2 densities and clustering values may be important when considering the response to therapy . Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 13 of 20 4 . Discussion The clinical antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab bind to extracellular domains of HER2 ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Using either trastuzumab - AF647 or pertuzumab - AF647 as probes for qSMLM , we assessed HER2 in the steady state of four cultured cell lines . We probed HER2 - positive luminal B cells , BT - 474 ( trastuzumab - sensitive ) and BT - 474 R ( trastuzumab - resistant ) , and HER2 - enriched cells , SK - BR - 3 ( trastuzumab - sensitive ) and JIMT - 1 ( trastuzumab - resistant ) . All cell lines were cultured without antibiotics . According to the obtained images ( Figure 1 ) , robust HER2 staining was achieved . Consistent with ﬂow cytometry [ 115 ] and our previous report [ 97 ] , BT - 474 cells had a higher detected HER2 density compared to SK - BR - 3 cells ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Trastuzumab binds to domain IV of HER2 , close to the plasma membrane . In contrast , pertuzumab binds to domain II , which is important for interactions with two other members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor family , HER1 and HER3 [ 106 ] . We used qSMLM to quantify how the binding to speciﬁc HER2 epitopes impacted the detected HER2 densities ; we also compared the effects in trastuzumab - sensitive vs . - resistant cell lines . To these ends , we calculated the ratio of detected HER2 obtained with the two probes ( trastuzumab / pertuzumab ) . In the four cell lines , the ratio was greater than one ( trastuzumab detected more HER2 molecules compared to pertuzumab ) . The ratios for the two trastuzumab - sensitive cell lines were 3 . 1 ( SK - BR - 3 ) and 2 . 6 ( BT - 474 ) . The ratios for the trastuzumab - resistant cell lines were 2 . 2 ( JIMT - 1 ) and 2 . 0 ( BT - 474 R ) . The higher ratios in sensitive cells vs . resistant cells could reﬂect the number of HER2 molecules engaged in heterodimers . According to recent molecular dynamic simulations , trastuzumab can bind to HER2 homodimers and heterodimers [ 116 ] ; it does not directly block the dimerization interface . Conversely , pertuzumab blocks the heterodimerization interface [ 106 ] . While we cannot rule out differences related to the analytical protocol ( e . g . , sensitivity to ﬁxation ) , steric effects may be in play for the two probes that bind to distinct HER2 epitopes . The two probes likely detect distinct HER2 pools . Using qSMLM , with molecular sensitivity we assessed how HER2 density ( detected with two clinical Abs ) compared between BT - 474 and BT - 474 R cells . Trastuzumab , but not pertuzumab ( Figures 1 and 2 ) , detected signiﬁcantly higher HER2 densities for BT - 474 cells . Additionally , published data using ﬂow cytometry ( using an Ab that did not compete with trastuzumab binding to HER2 ) suggest that the expression of HER2 is comparable in BT - 474 R and BT - 474 cells [ 99 ] . Thus , the differences in trastuzumab - detected HER2 densities with qSMLM may be caused by its reduced efﬁciency to bind HER2 in BT - 474 R cells , i . e . , steric occlusion of the binding epitope . Both trastuzumab and pertuzumab ( Figures 1 and 3 ) detected signiﬁcantly higher HER2 densities for SK - BR - 3 vs . JIMT - 1 cells . While these two cell lines have comparable DNA copy numbers [ 117 , 118 ] , SK - BR - 3 cells showed detected HER2 densities that were approximately eight - fold higher for trastuzumab and approximately six - fold higher for pertuzumab . One potential explanation for the discordance between the copy numbers and detected densities is inaccessible extracellular HER2 in resistant cell lines . For example , in JIMT - 1 cells , HER2 epitopes have been shown to be masked by glycosylated membrane proteins [ 51 , 119 ] . When trastuzumab was used as a probe , we also detected signiﬁcant differences in HER2 clustering . We considered HER2 clusters to have more than two molecules ( clustering beyond homodimers ) . In trastuzumab - sensitive vs . trastuzumab - resistant cells ( BT - 474 vs . BT - 474 R and SK - BR - 3 vs . JIMT - 1 ) , we observed more HER2 clusters and a higher fraction of clustered HER2 . Additionally , in SK - BR - 3 vs . JIMT - 1 cells , we observed a larger average cluster radius and more HER2 molecules per cluster . The differences in nano - organization were signiﬁcantly attenuated with the pertuzumab probe . While qSMLM ( with pertuzumab - AF647 ) did not detect any signiﬁcant difference in HER2 clustering parameters for BT - 474 vs . BT - 474 R cells , it detected a signiﬁcantly higher number of HER2 clusters per ROI in SK - BR - 3 vs . JIMT - 1 cells . We have previously shown that touch prep - qSMLM is a powerful tool for assessing HER2 molecules in human tissue specimens [ 97 ] . Here , we extended this methodology to Cancers 2022 , 14 , 2795 14 of 20 core biopsy samples obtained from six women prior to neoadjuvant therapy ( chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab ) . We detected highly resolved molecular details ( e . g . , membrane protrusions , Figure 4a ) and determined both the detected HER2 densities and clustering characteristics ( Figure 4b – f ) . Due to the number of available pa - tient specimens , our study was limited to a small sample size . However , we found high detected HER2 densities and signiﬁcant HER2 clustering in women who achieved pCR . Although pCR is not an established surrogate marker for long - term clinical outcomes , it is well - established that women who achieve pCR have a better prognosis than women who do not achieve pCR [ 120 , 121 ] . Although subjects received chemotherapy in addition to trastuzumab and pertuzumab ( and thus it is possible that pCR could have been achieved without HER2 - directed therapy ) , our data from human breast cancer biopsies are consistent with data from cultured cell lines . Given that increased clustering of receptors can result in the rapid internalization / degradation of HER2 or the formation of inactive plasma mem - brane complexes with biologic agents [ 89 , 90 ] , the clustering of HER2 may have important therapeutic implications . 5 . Conclusions Our qSMLM data indicate that a pool of plasma membrane - localized HER2 directly detected by trastuzumab ( but not pertuzumab ) may provide important insight into the therapy response in breast cancer cells . While other mechanisms of resistance may be in play , we have focused on the molecular assessment of HER2 that is accessible by clinical mAbs . Detected HER2 densities could complement the current clinical diagnostic tools by robustly quantifying HER2 protein levels that are available to therapeutic antibodies . Additionally , our data suggest that measurements of detected HER2 density alone cannot predict which women will beneﬁt the most from therapy . While P26 ( pCR ) , P18 ( RCB - I ) , and P20 ( RCB - II ) had low detected HER2 densities , HER2 clustering was reduced only for P18 and P20 . Thus , beyond HER2 expression , molecular receptor organization appears to be a relevant factor . Since such information cannot be obtained using conventional diffraction - limited microscopy , this qSMLM approach may be helpful in complementing other clinical assays to predict which women will respond to therapy .
