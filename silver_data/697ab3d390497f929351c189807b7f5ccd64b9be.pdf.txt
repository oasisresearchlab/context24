This study examines the effects of lifting mask mandates on COVID - 19 23 transmission within Massachusetts school districts . We first replicated previous 24 research by Cowger et al . ( 2022 ) utilizing a Difference - in - Difference ( DID ) model . Then , 25 we back project the case infection and calculate the Rt value to redo the DID analysis . 26 However , when shifting the outcome measurement to the reproductive number ( Rt ) , 27 our findings suggest that lifting mask mandates can only significantly influence the Rt 28 first two weeks post - intervention . This implies that while mask mandate plays a role in 29 mitigation , its lifting does not drastically influence COVID - 19 transmissibility in the long 30 term . 31 .

One 35 such NPI , recommending or even requiring people to wear face masks in certain 36 settings or locations , was commonly used during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Although 37 challenges exist in examining the effectiveness of face masks in preventing disease 38 transmissions that caused by the heterogeneity in mask materials , inconsistency in user 39 compliance and the coincidental implementation of other NPIs , it was later suggested to 40 be effective in mitigating COVID - 19 transmissions and adopted by schools ( Boutzoukas 41 et al . , 2022 ; Kim et al . , 2020 ; Sharma et al . , 2020 ) . As the pandemic progresses , many 42 local authorities relaxed mask mandates during periods when the pandemic appears to 43 be receding , while the impact of lifting these mandates on transmission remains under - 44 investigated . It ' s critical to understand both the potential reduction in transmission 45 when a mask mandate is introduced , as well as the possible increase in transmission 46 when such interventions are relaxed or removed . 47 48 Cowger et al . found significantly lower incidence in schools which maintained universal 49 masking compared to those without in the subsequent surge after mask mandates were 50 lifted in Massachusetts school in February 2021 ( Cowger et al . , 2022 ) , However , the 51 outcome measurement ( i . e . , incidence ) alone cannot fully reflect the transmission 52 process since it does not account for the exponential changes in case numbers during 53 the transmission . For instance , initial incidence discrepancies between two locations 54 can magnify over time , even if the reproductive number remains constant . Similar 55 oversights of transmission outcomes have been identified in studies about effectiveness 56 .

After replicating the original 62 analyses using a difference - in - difference model on incidence rate , we replaced the 63 outcome measurement with the effective reproductive number ( Rt ) . Rt is estimated as 64 the average number of secondary infections resulting from one infected individual , 65 measuring the transmissibility in a population ( Nash et al . , 2022 ) . The Rt reductions are 66 often used to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures in limiting the virus 67 transmission , with Rt below one indicating non - sustainable transmission under existing 68 measures . 69 70 RESULTS 71 We replicated Cowger et al . ( 2022 ) analysis using population - weighted COVID - 19 72 incidence as the outcome measurement in a difference - in - difference model . We 73 analysed data from 70 school districts in Massachusetts , with 46 lifting the mask 74 mandates in the first reporting week ( type 1 ) , and 15 and 9 districts lifting in the second 75 ( type 2 ) and third ( type 3 ) reporting week , respectively . Chelsea and Boston retained 76 their mandates ( type 4 ) . We only replicated results for students , as data on school staff 77 were not available . 78 79 Our replication results were consistent with those reported by Cowger et al . ' s . We found 80 that lifting the masking mandates in schools was associated with a notable increase in 81 .

We observed an average treatment 83 effect ( ATT ) of 39 . 1 ( 95 % CI : 20 . 4 - 57 . 4 ) COVID - 19 cases per 1 , 000 students associated 84 with lifting masking mandates , compared to 39 . 9 ( 95 % CI : 24 . 3 - 55 . 4 ) in the original 85 analysis ( Cowger et al . , 2022 ) . Analyses using incidence as outcomes suggested that 86 lifting the masking mandates in schools was associated with 39 . 1 additional cases per 87 1 , 000 students within a 15 - week period ( Figure 2C ) . 88 89 We further analysed the impact of lifting masks mandates on changes in Rt , which 90 measures COVID - 19 transmission intensity . Rt was estimated using method by Cori et 91 al . ’s method with a mean serial interval of 4 . 4 days ( standard deviation 3 . 0 days ) ( Alene 92 et al . , 2021 ) . Contrary to the original results using incidence rates , we found no 93 significant difference in Rt across district types , except for type 4 district , which showed 94 a slightly higher Rt in the first two weeks after lifting the mask mandates ( Figure 2B ) . 95 There was no association between lifting mask mandates and reductions in Rt ( ATT 96 0 . 04 , 95 % CI , - 0 . 11 to 0 . 20 ) throughout the entire post - lifting period ( Figure 2D ) . 97 Moreover , Rt remained below 1 from February to May , indicating a general decline in 98 the epidemic during that time until a new wave of the pandemic in late April . ( Figure 99 2B ) . 100 101 Sensitivity analysis yielded consistent results when using longer serial intervals ( Bi et 102 al . , 2020 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ) ( Table S1 ) and weighting difference - in - difference model with 103 populations ( Brantly Callaway , 2022 ; Callaway & Sant’Anna , 2021 ) ( Table S2 ) . Our 104 difference - in - difference analysis satisfied the parallel trend assumption and , according 105 .

( 2022 ) , other time - varying variables including vaccination rate and 106 community transmission remained stable during the study period . 107 108 DISCUSSION 109 We found no evidence that lifting mask mandates in Massachusetts schools significantly 110 affected COVID - 19 transmission rates , which is contrary to the findings reported by 111 Cowger et al . Our findings demonstrate that substantial changes in incidence or case 112 numbers do not necessarily reflect substantial changes in underlying transmission . 113 Additionally , we found non - sustainable transmission ( i . e . , Rt < 1 ) across all school 114 districts before masks mandates were lifted , suggesting that factors other than lifting 115 mask mandates impacted COVID - 19 transmission in these schools , such as community 116 transmission and the implementation of other measures ( e . g . , extensive testing ) ( Braga 117 et al . , 2022 ; Falk et al . , 2021 ; Head et al . , 2022 ; Juutinen et al . , 2023 ) . 118 119 Our findings highlight the importance of considering transmissibility outcomes when 120 assessing the effectiveness of interventions against disease transmission ( Cowger et al . , 121 2022 ) . While as counts - based outcomes ( e . g . , incidence ) can serve as proxies for the 122 difficult - to - measure transmission process , it is crucial to note that nonpharmaceutical 123 interventions work by reducing person - to - person transmission , reducing subsequent 124 incidence from what it would have been without the interventions . Due to exponential 125 case growth and delays in disease development ( e . g . , incubation periods ) , changes in 126 case counts may exaggerate and lag changes in transmission . Therefore , caution is 127 necessary when interpreting the effects of interventions based on solely on analyses of 128 incidence rates . 129 130 .

Firstly , we were unable to account for unobserved 131 heterogeneities , such as mask types and compliance with mask mandates . Therefore , 132 our findings reflect the impact of the lifting of masks mandate policies rather than the 133 direct effects of mask - wearing ( Gettings et al . , 2022 ; Tupper & Colijn , 2021 ) . Secondly , 134 we only estimated Rt using student cases , and we were unable to account for factors 135 such as transmission between student and staff and external community due to data 136 availability . Consequently , our results may partially capture the within - school 137 transmission dynamics . 138 139 In summary , we found limited impact of lifting mask mandates on reducing COVID - 19 140 transmission in Massachusetts schools in February 2021 . Future assessments of the 141 effects of interventions against transmission should consider including transmissibility 142 outcomes . 143 .
