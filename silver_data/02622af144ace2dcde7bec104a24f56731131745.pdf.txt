The development of new tools to target speci ﬁ c steps in the neuronal differentiation process is of paramount importance for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved , and ultimately for developing effective therapeutic strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders . Through their interactions with extracellular matrix proteins , the cell adhesion molecules of the integrin family play essential roles in the formation of functional neuronal circuits by regulating cell migration , neurite outgrowth , dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity . However , how different integrin receptors contribute to the successive phases of neuronal differentiation remains to be elucidated . Here , we implemented a CRISPR activation system to enhance the endogenous expression of speci ﬁ c integrin subunits in an in vitro model of neuronal differentiation , the murine neuroblastoma Neuro2a cell line . By combining CRISPR activation with morphological and RT - qPCR analyses , we show that integrins of the α V family are powerful inducers of neuronal differentiation . Further , we identify a subtype - speci ﬁ c role for α V integrins in controlling neurite outgrowth . While α V β 3 integrin initiates neuronal differentiation of Neuro2a cells under proliferative conditions , α V β 5 integrin appears responsible for promoting a complex arborization in cells already committed to differentiation . Interestingly , primary neurons exhibit a complementary expression pattern for β 3 and β 5 integrin subunits during development . Our ﬁ ndings reveal the existence of a developmental switch between α V integrin subtypes during differentiation and suggest that a timely controlled modulation of the expression of α V integrins by CRISPRa provides a means to promote neuronal differentiation .

By transducing chemical and mechanical signals from the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton , the cell adhesion molecules of the integrin family are key regulators of cell migration , neurite outgrowth , synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity ( Cheyuo et al . , 2019 ; Chighizola et al . , 2019 ; Jaudon et al . , 2021 ; Lilja and Ivaska , 2018 ; Park and Goda , 2016 ; Prowse et al . , 2011 ; Schmid and Anton , 2003 ; Thalhammer and Cingolani , 2014 ; Wojcik - Stanaszek et al . , 2011 ) . In mammals , there are 18 alpha and 8 beta subunits , forming 24 integrin heterodimers ( Bachmann et al . , 2019 ; Takada et al . , 2007 ) . How different integrin heterodimers cooperate in regulating neuronal differentiation remains , however , largely unknown . The α V subunit , which is highly expressed in both neural progenitor cells and neurons ( Hall et al . , 2006 ; Pinkstaff et al . , 1999 ) , dimerizes with ﬁ ve different beta subunits ( β 1 , β 3 , β 5 , β 6 , and β 8 ; Figure 1A ) to form integrin receptors that recognize an RGD ( arginine - glycine - aspartic acid ) motif on their extracellular ligands . Previous studies have shown that α V β 3 integrin supports the proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells ( Fietz et al . , 2010 ; Stenzel et al . , 2014 ) , while α V β 5 integrin promotes the differentiation of various types of neurons , such FIGURE 1 | CRISPRa enhances expression of α V integrin subunit in N2a cells .

Integrins in Neuronal Differentiation as cerebellar granule cells ( Abe et al . , 2018 ; Oishi et al . , 2021 ) and retinal ganglion cells ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting a role for these integrins in regulating different aspects of neuronal differentiation . Here , we investigate how enhancing the expression levels of two major α V integrin subunits ( α V and β 3 ) regulates neurite outgrowth and branching in an in vitro model of neuronal differentiation , the neuroblastoma Neuro2a ( N2a ) cell line . By combining the CRISPR activation ( CRISPRa ) technology , which relies on a catalytically inactive nuclease dead Cas9 ( dCas9 ) fused to a transcriptional activator to enhance the expression of genes of interest ( Gilbert et al . , 2014 ) , with morphological analyses and RT - qPCR , we show that α V β 3 integrin initiates differentiation of N2a cells under proliferative conditions , while α V β 5 integrin likely stabilizes neurites in N2a cells already committed to differentiation . We further show that β 3 and β 5 integrin subunits exhibit a complementary expression pattern during primary neuron development . Our ﬁ ndings reveal that neuronal differentiation requires a ﬁ nely tuned division of labor between α V integrin subtypes . MATERIALS AND METHODS gRNA Design and Plasmid Construction We used the web tool http : / / crispr . mit . edu / ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) to design three gRNAs targeting the region from − 10 to − 300 bp relative to the transcription start site ( TSS ) of the mouse Itgav gene . As negative control served a non - targeting gRNA sequence ( gRNA Ctrl ; Figure 1B ) . The gRNA sequences were inserted downstream of the U6 promoter into the pU6 - ( BbsI ) - EF1a - dCas9 - VP64 - T2A - EGFP plasmid ( Jaudon et al . , 2019 ) using the BbsI cloning sites . N2a Cell Culture and Transfection We cultured mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells in Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM , Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 2 mM glutamine , 100 U / ml penicillin and 0 . 1 mg / ml streptomycin ( complete culture medium ) , and maintained them in a 5 % CO 2 humidi ﬁ ed incubator at 37 ° C . Cells were passaged 2 – 3 times a week at 80 % con ﬂ uence . For transfection , we seeded N2a cells in 6 - well plates in complete culture medium at 200 , 000 and 100 , 000 cells / well for RT - qPCR and immunocytochemistry experiments , respectively . Coverslips were coated with 2 . 5 μ g / ml poly - D - lysine ( PDL ; Cat . No . P7405 , Sigma ) or 5 μ g / ml ﬁ bronectin ( Cat . No . F8141 , Sigma ) . The following day , cells were transfected with 4 μ g DNA / well using the Ca 2 + phosphate method ( Thalhammer et al . , 2017 ) and used for experiments 24 – 72 h post - transfection . N2a Cell Differentiation Twenty - four hours after transfection , complete culture medium was replaced by serum - free medium ( formulated as the complete medium but without FBS ) to induce differentiation ( Schubert et al . , 1969 ) . Under these conditions , neurite outgrowth was observed within 12 – 24 h . Differentiated cells were used for experiments 48 h after serum deprivation . Primary Cortical Culture Cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from P0 C57BL / 6J pups as previously described ( Korotchenko et al . , 2014 ; Thalhammer et al . , 2017 ) , with minor modi ﬁ cations . Brie ﬂ y , cortices were dissected in ice - cold HBSS , digested with papain ( 30 U ; Cat . No . 3126 , Worthington ) for 40 min at 37 ° C , washed and triturated in attachment medium ( BME medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 3 mg / ml glucose , 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES - NaOH [ pH 7 . 40 ] ) with a ﬂ ame - polished glass Pasteur pipette . Cells were seeded at a concentration of 95 , 000 cells / well onto 1 . 2 cm diameter glass coverslips coated with 2 . 5 μ g / ml poly - D - lysine ( PDL ; P7405 , Sigma ) and 1 μ g / ml laminin ( L2020 , Sigma ) . After 4 h , the attachment medium was replaced with maintenance medium ( Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2 . 6 % B27 , 6 mg / ml glucose , 2 mM GlutaMax , 90 U / ml penicillin and 0 . 09 mg / ml streptomycin ) . To prevent glia overgrowth , 0 . 5 µM of cytosine β - D - arabinofuranoside ( AraC ) was added at 1 day in vitro ( DIV ) . RNA Extraction and RT - qPCR Total RNA was extracted with QIAzol lysis reagent ( Cat . No . 79306 , Qiagen ) from transfected N2a cells or primary neurons at different developmental stages as previously described ( Thalhammer et al . , 2018 ) . We prepared cDNAs by reverse transcription of 1 μ g of RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit ( Cat . No . 205311 , Qiagen ) . RT - qPCR was performed in triplicate with 10 ng of template cDNA using iQTM SYBR ® Green Supermix ( Cat . No . 1708886 , Biorad ) on a CFX96 Real - Time PCR Detection System ( Biorad ) with the following universal conditions : 5 min at 95 ° C , 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 ° C for 15 s and annealing / extension at 60 ° C for 45 s . The relative quanti ﬁ cation of gene expression was determined using the ΔΔ Ct method . Data were normalized to glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( Gapdh ) , β - actin ( Actb ) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 ( Hprt1 ) by the multiple internal control gene method with GeNorm algorithm ( Vandesompele et al . , 2002 ) . Sequences of all the primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . Immunocytochemistry Transfected cells were ﬁ xed for 10 min in 4 % PFA at room temperature ( RT ) , permeabilized for 10 min at RT with 0 . 2 % Triton - X 100 and blocked for 30 min at RT with 5 % NGS . Chicken anti - GFP ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Cat . No . AB13970 , Abcam ) and rabbit anti - β tubulin III ( 1 : 500 ; Cat . No . T2200 , Sigma - Aldrich ) primary antibodies were used for either 2 h at RT or overnight at 4 ° C . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor488 - conjugated anti - chicken ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Cat . No . A11039 , ThermoFisher scienti ﬁ c ) and Alexa Fluor568 - conjugated anti - rabbit ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Cat . No . A11036 , ThermoFisher scienti ﬁ c ) . We stained cell nuclei with Hoechst ( 1 mg / ml ; Cat . No . B2261 , Sigma - Aldrich ) and mounted coverslips with ProLong Gold ( Cat . No . P10144 , ThermoFisher scienti ﬁ c ) .

Neurite length was measured in the red channel ( β tubulin III ) for all EGFP positive cells using the NeuronJ plugin of ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . net / NeuronJ ) . Cells were considered differentiated if they had one or more processes at least twice as long as their cell bodies . We calculated the percentage of differentiated cells relative to the number of transfected cells ( EGFP positive ) . Sholl analysis was performed on all differentiated transfected cells using the Sholl plugin of ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . net / Sholl _ Analysis ) with a starting radius of 1 µm and a radius step size of 5 μ m . For morphological analyses , we de ﬁ ned unipolar cells as those with only one unbranched process , bipolar cells as those with two unbranched processes extending in opposite directions from the soma and complex cells as those with more than two unbranched processes or displaying at least one neurite with branches . Statistical Analysis Data are presented as mean ± SEM . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was set at p < 0 . 05 and assessed using one - way ANOVA followed by the Tukey ’ s post hoc multiple comparison test , repeated measures two - way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett ’ s post hoc multiple comparison test or two - way ANOVA followed by the Tukey ’ s post hoc multiple comparison test , as speci ﬁ ed in ﬁ gure legends . The Chi - square test was used in Figures 2G , 3G ; Supplementary Figures S1G , S2G ( Prism 7 , GraphPad Software , Inc . ) . RESULTS CRISPRa Enhances α V Integrin Expression in N2a Cells We have explored the possibility of using CRISPRa to enhance transcription of the α V integrin subunit as a means to promote neuronal differentiation of the murine neuroblastoma N2a cells . To this end , we have designed three gRNAs targeting the promoter of Itgav ( the gene encoding α V integrin ; Figure 1B ) and expressed them in N2a cells together with dCas9 fused to the transcriptional activator VP64 ( Perez - Pinera et al . , 2013 ; Matharu et al . , 2019 ) . To minimize experimental variability , we have relied on a single vector designed to co - express a gRNA , dCas9 - VP64 and the ﬂ orescent protein EGFP ( Figure 1C ) . EGFP allowed us to unambiguously identify transfected cells . As quanti ﬁ ed by RT - qPCR 24 h post - transfection , all three gRNAs increased the expression of α V integrin by 2 to 3 - fold , with gRNA Itgav - 2 being the most effective ( Figure 1D ) . We next combined the three gRNAs . While any combination of two of them did not further increase Itgav expression , combining all three of them increased it by 5 . 3 - fold ( Figure 1D ) . Thus , CRISPRa can be used to boost expression of endogenous α V integrin in N2a cells . α V β 3 Integrin Promotes Neuronal Differentiation of Proliferating N2a Cells We next addressed whether enhanced α V integrin expression promotes neuronal differentiation of N2a cells . When cultured in proliferative conditions ( i . e . , in medium containing 10 % serum ; Figures 2A , B ) , only 3 . 5 % of cells expressing gRNA Ctrl exhibited at least one neurite . Maximal CRISPRa for α V integrin ( using three gRNAs ) induced neurite outgrowth in ~ 14 % of the cells ( Figures 2B , C ) . We next compared these effects with those induced by CRISPRa for β 3 integrin , a major partner of α V integrin in the brain ( Figure 1A ) , and whose function has extensively been characterized in neurons in terms of synaptic function ( Cingolani et al . , 2008 ; Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ; McGeachie et al . , 2011 ; McGeachie et al . , 2012 ; Kerrisk et al . , 2014 ; Park and Goda , 2016 ; Jaudon et al . , 2021 ) . To this end , we used two previously characterized gRNAs targeting the mouse promoter of Itgb3 , the gene for β 3 integrin . When used together , these two gRNAs increase β 3 integrin expression in N2a cells by ~ 6 - fold ( Jaudon et al . , 2019 ) ; see also Figure 4A , top middle panel ) . Despite a similar ef ﬁ cacy of CRISPRa for the two integrin subunits , activation of Itgb3 was twice as effective as activation of Itgav in inducing neurite outgrowth ( ~ 32 % and ~ 14 % of differentiated cells for Itgb3 and Itgav , respectively ; Figures 2B , C ) . We next co - activated Itgav and Itgb3 . Co - activation was as effective as single gene activation in elevating Itgb3 and Itgav expression ( Figure 4A , top left and top middle panels ) , indicating that CRISPRa ef ﬁ cacy is not diluted by targeting two genes ( with ﬁ ve constructs ) instead of one ( with two or three constructs ) . The effect on neurite outgrowth was nevertheless comparable to that obtained by activating Itgav alone ( ~ 11 % and ~ 14 % of differentiated cells for Itgb3 / Itgav coactivation and Itgav activation , respectively ; Figures 2B , C ) , indicating that the effects of α V integrin are dominant over those of β 3 integrin . Within the population of differentiated cells , increased expression of Itgav or Itgb3 or both affected neither the average neurite length per cell ( Figure 2D ) nor the length of the longest neurite in each cell ( Figure 2E ) . We detected only a signi ﬁ cant increase in total neurite length per cell upon Itgb3 activation ( Figure 2F ) . Taken together , these results suggest that β 3 integrin , rather than contributing to neurite elongation , promotes a higher number of processes and branches per cell . To verify this hypothesis , we next examined morphology and arborization of the differentiated cells by Sholl analysis . While differentiated cells expressing gRNA Ctrl were mainly unipolar , those transfected with gRNAs targeting Itgav or Itgb3 or both presented predominantly a complex multipolar morphology with branched neurites . The effects were especially prominent when targeting exclusively Itgb3 ( Figure 2G ) . Accordingly , the Sholl analysis revealed that the cells with higher levels of β 3 integrin FIGURE 2 | classi ﬁ cation of differentiated N2a cells . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , Chi - square test ( n = 17 , 35 , 51 , and 34 cells from four independent experiments for gRNA Ctrl , gRNAs Itgav , gRNAs Itgb3 and gRNAs Itgav + Itgb3 , respectively ) .

Integrins in Neuronal Differentiation displayed a more complex arborization than control cells ( Figure 2H ) . Because N2a cells were plated on a polycationic substrate ( poly - D - lysine ; PDL ) that promotes cell adhesion in an integrin - independent manner , some of the differential effects between α V and β 3 integrins on neurite outgrowth might be due to a limited availability of integrin subtype - speci ﬁ c extracellular ligands . To rule out this possibility , we next plated N2a cells on ﬁ bronectin , an extracellular matrix protein that binds to all α V - containing integrins ( Johansson et al . , 1997 ) . Also under these experimental conditions , activation of Itgb3 was more effective than that of Itgav in inducing neuronal differentiation and promoting a complex arborization ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Because the β 3 subunit pairs exclusively with the α V subunit in nucleated cells while the α V subunit pairs with ﬁ ve different beta subunits ( Figure 1A ; Hynes , 2002 ) , these data suggest that Itgb3 activation skews the composition of α V heterodimers towards α V β 3 integrin , thus promoting effectively neuronal differentiation of N2a cells maintained in proliferative conditions , while Itgav activation ( alone or in combination with that of Itgb3 ) boosts the expression of α V heterodimers that restrain α V β 3 integrin function under proliferative conditions . α V Integrins Promote Neurite Arborization of Differentiated N2a Cells In response to serum deprivation , N2a cells assume a morphology similar to that of mature neurons ( Schubert et al . , 1969 ) . We therefore examined how CRISPRa for Itgav and Itgb3 affects differentiation of N2a cells under pro - differentiating conditions ( Figure 3A ) . As expected , removal of serum from the culture medium resulted in a higher percentage of differentiated cells in all conditions ( Figures 2B , C vs . Figures 3B , C ; for gRNA Ctrl : ~ 28 % vs . ~ 3 . 5 % of differentiated cells , respectively ) . CRISPRa for either Itgav or Itgb3 or both effectively increased N2a differentiation also under these conditions . As opposed to the proliferative state , the effects of activating Itgav were however as robust as those induced by Itgb3 activation ( ~ 51 % vs . ~ 53 % of differentiated cells , respectively ) . Moreover , co - activation of the two genes did not signi ﬁ cantly change the percentage of differentiated cells as compared to single gene activation ( Figures 3B , C ; 62 % of differentiated cells ) , suggesting either a shared mechanism involving up - regulation of α V β 3 integrin for the three experimental conditions or a concomitant contribution of different α V integrin - containing heterodimers to the differentiation process . We next considered more closely the morphology of the differentiated cells . As in proliferative conditions , changes in the expression levels of Itgav or Itgb3 or both affected neither the average neurite length per cell ( Figure 3D ) nor the length of the longest neurite in each cell ( Figure 3E ) . As opposed to the proliferative conditions , the total neurite length per cell was , however , signi ﬁ cantly increased upon Itgav , rather than Itgb3 , activation ( Figure 3F ) . Morphological and Sholl analyses further revealed that Itgav activation was more , rather than less , effective than Itgb3 activation in promoting a complex arborization ( Figures 3G , H ) . The differences between activation of Itgav and Itgb3 for N2a cell differentiation were even more pronounced when the cells were plated on ﬁ bronectin ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Thus , while α V β 3 integrin is extremely effective at inducing neuronal differentiation under proliferative conditions , other α V integrin - containing heterodimers appear to play a major role in stabilizing a complex arborization at later stages of differentiation . Expression of α V Integrin Subunits in N2a Cells and Primary Cortical Neurons To get insights into which α V integrin heterodimers may favor branching and stabilization of neurites in N2a cells , we quanti ﬁ ed , by RT - qPCR , the mRNA levels of all the beta subunits known to pair with the α V subunit ( Figure 1A ; Hynes , 2002 ; Lilja and Ivaska , 2018 ) ; under control conditions and following CRISPRa for Itgav or Itgb3 or both ( Figure 4A ) . As expected , targeting the promoter of Itgav and Itgb3 with CRISPRa increased the expression level of the respective genes , both in proliferative and differentiating conditions ( Figure 4A , top left and top middle panels ) . Strikingly , CRISPRa for Itgav increased also the expression of Itgb5 ( the gene for β 5 integrin ) selectively in differentiating conditions ( ~ 63 % increase relative to control differentiated conditions ; Figure 4A , bottom left panel ) . Rather than being due to a direct effect of dCas9 - VP64 on the Itgb5 promoter , the increase in β 5 integrin expression levels was likely the consequence of a co - regulation of Itgav and Itgb5 . Indeed , no increase in β 5 integrin expression levels was observed under proliferative conditions or under conditions favoring formation of the α V β 3 heterodimer ( co - activation of Itgav and Itgb3 ; Figure 4A , bottom left panel ) . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings suggest that up - regulation of α V β 5 integrin may promote branching and stabilization of neurites at later stages of differentiation in N2a cells . To address whether the differences between α V integrin heterodimers are relevant in terms of neuronal differentiation , we next analyzed , in primary cortical neurons , the developmental expression pattern for all the subunits of α V integrin heteromers . Interestingly , the transcripts for Itgb3 and Itgb5 exhibited a complementary expression pro ﬁ le : Itgb3 peaked at 9 DIV ( Figure 4B , top middle panel ) , when dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis reach their maximum rate ( Harrill et al . , 2015 ) , while Itgb5 showed a dip during the same time period ( Figure 4B , FIGURE 3 | differentiated N2a cells . * p < 0 . 05 , * * * p < 0 . 001 , Chi - square test ( n = 55 , 82 , 75 , and 83 cells from 5 independent experiments for gRNA Ctrl , gRNAs Itgav , gRNAsItgb3 andgRNAs Itgav + Itgb3 , respectively ) .

The transcripts for Itgav and Itgb1 remained stable from 1 to 16 DIV , while those for Itgb6 and Itgb8 decreased progressively during the same time period ( Figure 4B ) . These data suggest therefore that the expression of α V integrins is dynamically regulated during neuronal differentiation . DISCUSSION Our ﬁ ndings indicate that CRISPRa for α V integrins promotes neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma N2a cells , without the need for serum deprivation . Further , they strongly suggest a subunit - speci ﬁ c role of α V integrins in controlling neurite outgrowth . By combining CRISPRa , RT - qPCR and morphological analyses , we show that α V β 3 integrin initiates neuronal differentiation of N2a cells under proliferative conditions , while α V β 5 integrin is likely responsible for stabilizing neurites in cells already committed to differentiation . Neuronal differentiation requires a series of consecutive steps starting with neural induction and cell proliferation events , followed by neuronal migration , neurite extension and axon - dendrite polarization . This precise differentiation program is due also to a coordinated rearrangement of the cytoskeleton in response to extracellular cues . Several integrins have been implicated in transducing extracellular signals to support outgrowth , branching or stabilization of neurites . For example , the laminin receptor α 3 β 1 integrin signals through Arg kinase and p190RhoGAP to attenuate RhoA activity , thus stabilizing the dendritic arbor of adult , but not juvenile , hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons ( Warren et al . , 2012 ; Kerrisk et al . , 2013 ) , whereas β 3 integrin contributes to establish a caudomedial - to - rostrolateral complexity gradient of basal dendrites in layer II / III cortical pyramidal neurons ( Swinehart et al . , 2020 ) . Integrins are also important for axon outgrowth . In the peripheral nervous system , α 9 β 1 integrin functions as a receptor for the extracellular matrix protein tenascin - C , which is upregulated after injury , and indeed , exogenous expression of integrin α 9 in dorsal root ganglia neurons promotes some axonal regeneration into the dorsal root entry after dorsal column crush lesion , resulting in limited sensory recovery ( Andrews et al . , 2009 ) . Comparatively less is known about how α V integrins , which are highly expressed in both neural progenitor cells and neurons ( Pinkstaff et al . , 1999 ; Hall et al . , 2006 ) , contribute to neurite outgrowth at early stages of differentiation . This group of integrins comprise ﬁ ve members ( Figure 1A ) , whose expression is ﬁ nely modulated during maturation of cortical neurons ( Figure 4B ) . To decipher their role in the initial steps of neurite outgrowth , we induced a 5 to 6 - fold increase in the endogenous expression of α V or β 3 integrin subunits or both in N2a cells maintained in proliferative conditions . While both subunits promoted neuronal differentiation of N2a cells , we observed a stronger induction with β 3 integrin . Given that this subunit pairs exclusively with the α V in nucleated cells ( Hynes , 2002 ; Lilja and Ivaska , 2018 ) , an increase in β 3 integrin expression levels is likely to shift the balance of all α V - containing receptors towards the α V β 3 heterodimer . This α V integrin appears therefore the most effective in promoting extension and branching of neurites in the initial phases of N2a cell differentiation . The situation was surprisingly reversed in N2a cells already committed to neuronal differentiation by serum deprivation : neurite complexity was supported more effectively by activation of the α V rather than the β 3 subunit . Because boosting α V expression in differentiated cells induced also a concomitant upregulation of the β 5 subunit , we concluded that the α V β 5 heterodimer is likely the most important α V integrin in stabilizing neurites at later stages of differentiation . This shift in dependency for neurite arborization from α V β 3 to α V β 5 integrin likely re ﬂ ects differences in subcellular localization or signalling between the two integrins ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ; Lock et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) , rather than a limited access to extracellular ligands . Indeed , both α V β 3 and α V β 5 integrins exhibit robust cell surface expression without the need for speci ﬁ c extracellular ligands ( Sun et al . , 2021 ) , and the differences in neurite differentiation between the two heterodimers were observed irrespective of the plating substrate . The most prominent effect of ﬁ bronectin was actually to inhibit neurite outgrowth following CRISPRa for Itgav under proliferative conditions ; in comparison , there were only minor effects of ﬁ bronectin upon CRISPRa for Itgb3 or Itgb3 and Itgav under the same proliferative conditions ( compare Figure 2C with Supplementary Figure S1C ) . Recent data show that α V β 3 integrin is able to bind ﬁ bronectin only in an extended - open conformation following high mechanical load ( Bachmann et al . , 2020 ; Jaudon et al . , 2021 ) , which may favour dynamic binding - unbinding to and from the substrate during early neuritogenesis . Indeed , in many cell types , α V β 3 integrin localizes in highly dynamic focal adhesion complexes linked to talin and actin stress ﬁ bers , while α V β 5 integrin has recently been found enriched in a new type of adhesion complex ( referred to as ﬂ at clathrin lattices ) , which lacks classical adhesion proteins and associates with branched cortical actin , rather than actin stress ﬁ bers ( Lock et al . , 2018 ; Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . Despite being rich in components of the clathrin - mediated endocytosis machinery , ﬂ at clathrin lattices are FIGURE 4 | ( * * ) ; serum starvation effect : F ( 1 , 40 ) = 17 . 01 , p < 0 . 001 ( * * * ) ; serum starvation × gRNA interaction : F ( 3 , 40 ) = 1 . 818 , p = 0 . 16 .

Frontiers in Genome Editing | www . frontiersin . org April 2022 | Volume 4 | Article 846669 9 Riccardi et al . Integrins in Neuronal Differentiation highly static structures with very low endocytic activity . This is mainly due to α V β 5 integrin binding tightly to the substrate , thus preventing the formation of clathrin - coated pits ( Baschieri et al . , 2018 ) . These unique features of α V β 5 integrin are most likely due to an insert of eight amino acids in the cytosolic tail of the β 5 subunit , which is not found in any other beta subunit and may be responsible for the subcellular localization of α V β 5 integrin in ﬂ at clathrin lattices ( Zuidema et al . , 2018 ) . Although these adhesion complexes have not been described in N2a cells and neurons , it is possible that α V β 5 integrin supports more static cell - substrate interactions that slow down outgrowth of neurites at early stages of neuronal differentiation , while effectively stabilizing them once formed . Our results on the cooperation between α V integrin heterodimers in regulating different stages of N2a cell differentiation are in line with previous ﬁ ndings in granule cell precursors of the developing cerebellum . In these cells , α V β 3 integrin contributes to suppressing proliferation , whereas α V β 5 integrin promotes the transition to granule cells and induces axon speci ﬁ cation via a signalling pathway involving the kinases PI3K , Akt and GSK3 β ( Abe et al . , 2018 ; Oishi et al . , 2021 ) . Therefore , a shift from α V β 3 integrin - to α V β 5 integrin - mediated cell adhesion might represent a general mechanism during development for promoting the transition from proliferating precursors to differentiating cells . Here , we showed that CRISPRa can be used to regulate effectively the expression of these integrins , thereby promoting a coordinated progression of N2a cells towards a neuron - like phenotype . CRISPRa is not as prone as CRISPR - mediated genome editing to off - target effects because it does not rely on genomic DNA cleavage but requires persistent binding to a promoter region . Furthermore , the possibility of targeting one or multiple genes , using one or multiple gRNAs for each gene , and the availability of various transcriptional activators , such as VP64 , VPR , SAM , and Suntag ( Chavez et al . , 2015 ; Konermann et al . , 2015 ) , as well as transcriptional repressors for CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) , makes this system easily customable to regulate precisely gene expression ( Zheng et al . , 2018 ; Zhou et al . , 2018 ; Matharu et al . , 2019 ; Savell et al . , 2019 ) . By contrast , overexpression paradigms are far less versatile and elevate the expression of the gene of interest by several folds with possible toxic effects ( Jaudon et al . , 2019 ) . A temporally controlled activation of gene expression could be achieved by combining CRISPRa with inducible systems such as the tetracycline - dependent promoter ( Tet ) system ( Dow et al . , 2015 ; de Solis et al . , 2016 ) or photoactivable proteins ( Kawano et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , it could be possible to switch the expression of distinct integrin subunits at speci ﬁ c steps of neuronal differentiation . In summary , our ﬁ ndings show that CRISPRa - mediated enhancement of α V integrins is a powerful and versatile strategy to induce neurite outgrowth and stabilization . These new tools could be used to promote neuronal differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells , which express α V integrins ( Rowland et al . , 2010 ) , or to ameliorate neurite abnormalities in mouse models of brain disorders .
