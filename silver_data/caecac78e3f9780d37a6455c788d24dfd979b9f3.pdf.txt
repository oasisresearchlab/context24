A large body of scientific knowledge exists on this topic represented by ( i ) findings from experiments examining the factors that impact the user experience of gesture - based interaction , such as social acceptability [ 44 ] , memorability [ 37 ] , perceived difficulty [ 61 ] , and naturalness [ 22 ] , and ( ii ) insights into users’ preferences for ges - tures elicited in gesture elicitation studies ( GESs ) [ 58 , 69 , 70 ] . GESs , as a specialized instance of participatory design [ 51 ] , are a power - ful method in the toolbox of HCI researchers and practitioners to unveil users’ preferences for and mental models of gesture - based interaction . In these studies , participants propose gestures they would like to use to effect the system functions of interactive sys - tems , such as zooming in on a map with touch input [ 70 ] or turning on / off the TV set with a smart ring [ 16 ] . The practitioner analyzes the elicited gestures to develop an understanding of users’ prefer - ences for gesture commands that are perceived to be intuitive [ 69 ] , low effort [ 70 ] , and memorable [ 37 ] and , consequently , likely to reflect the preferences of the larger user population . With time , this understanding turns into consolidated knowledge [ 29 , 65 , 66 ] , on which the community can capitalize to inform the design of gesture - based interactions reflective of end users’ preferences . Since the introduction of the method [ 69 ] , a large number of GESs have been conducted [ 65 ] and have reported findings and design recommendations on touch input [ 70 ] , mid - air hand ges - tures [ 59 ] , interactions in AR [ 41 ] , radar gestures [ 33 ] , smartphone motion gestures [ 46 ] , deformable displays [ 55 ] , smartwatches and smartglasses [ 12 ] , smart rings [ 16 ] , public displays [ 45 ] , and in - vehicle input [ 9 ] . These results constitute a substantial body of scientific and design knowledge about users - defined gestures . How - ever , this rich body of knowledge has several shortcomings that limit the wide application and exploitation of the findings of GES . S 1 . Scattered literature : GESs are published at various venues , from human - computer interaction [ 70 ] to intelligent trans - portation [ 9 ] to computational intelligence and design [ 22 ] , making their findings difficult to identify and access . AVI 2022 , June 6 – 10 , 2022 , Frascati , Rome , Italy Gheran et al . S 2 . Heterogeneous findings : GESs employ different methods of analysis , not always consistent with each other . S 3 . Partial coverage of context : Some GESs lack a full descrip - tion of the context of use in which the gestures are elicited . The context is sometimes unspecified ( no information about the target users , the intended environment , or other contex - tual conditions ) or partially specified ( some dimensions are explicitly reported whereas others are missing or implied ) . S 4 . Partial evidence : Some GESs do not provide any indication whether the user - defined gestures they report are represen - tative of consensus among different contexts or user popula - tions , or if the consensus emerged during that study alone . S 5 . Difficulty of cross - checking findings : Findings from different GESs are difficult to structure and put in correspondence because of the different methods , measures , target end - user populations , devices , contexts of use , or missing information . These shortcomings can be addressed in the context of repro - ducible research . However , replications of GESs have been scarce and , when conducted , they surfaced replication problems . For in - stance , when reanalyzing data collected by prior work , Tsandi - las [ 56 ] noted that he “could not reproduce the agreement values that the [ original ] authors reported because the similarity criteria that they used to classify gestures were ill - defined” ( p . 18 : 43 ) , which is an example of failed method reproducibility [ 19 ] . In their GES about interactions with 3D objects on a public display , Du et al . [ 13 ] concluded that “repeating the study with participants from other groups ( e . g . , children , older people , or people with little technology experience ) would lead to a more complete picture of users’ per - ceptions and needs regarding interaction with 3D objects shown on public displays” ( p . 201 ) , which suggests that the reproducibility of the results [ 19 ] may depend on the category of users . Furthermore , while discussing whole - body gestures , Vatavu [ 60 ] showed how the choice of similarity criteria that practitioners could use to group the elicited gestures into classes of similar types has a direct impact on the magnitude of agreement rates reported in GESs , i . e . , both the reproducibility of the results and the inferential reproducibility [ 19 ] are threatened . Replications of GESs can be found in just a handful of papers , of which just four [ 24 , 38 , 47 , 52 ] have considered replication as their primary goal , to the best of our knowledge . Possible causes for this state of things are the degree that replications are in general small in HCI [ 26 ] , and the concept of replication itself , which may be con - fusing to researchers due to the many definitions 1 in the scientific literature [ 1 , 2 , 8 , 19 , 26 , 42 ] . Furthermore , there is no formalization of how replications could be implemented for the specifics of GESs or how existing GES findings could be extended or generalized . In this context , the contributions of our work are manyfold : ( 1 ) We formalize replication , extension , generalization , and re - purposing of GES findings with RepliGES , a conceptual space that specifies five types of replications , three types of extensions and generalizations , and two types of repur - posing studies that reuse previous GES findings for new discoveries ; see Figure 2 . 1 To keep consistent with RepliCHI terminology [ 14 , 26 , 68 ] , we use replication in this paper as an umbrella term to denote all possible instances of repeating , reconduct - ing , reproducing , reimplementing and repurposing a GES . As we advance with our discussion , we characterize specific instances of replicating GESs ( Figure 2 ) . ( 2 ) Based on RepliGES , we introduced GEStory , an interactive design space meant to structure , visualize , and identify user - defined gestures from an electronic database of gestures reported by 216 published GESs ; see Figure 3 . ( 3 ) Using GEStory , we identify a set of twelve GES replications in the scientific literature , which we characterize using the dimensions of our RepliGES conceptual space ; see Figure 6 . ( 4 ) We propose a set of replicability criteria to foster replica - tions , extensions , generalizations , and repurposing of find - ings about user - defined gestures ; see Figure 1 . 2 RELATED WORK We start our discussion of related work with a brief overview of the gesture elicitation method [ 69 , 70 ] , and we describe recent devel - opments and tools to support its implementation . We also discuss research reproducibility in Computer Science and HCI . 2 . 1 Gesture Elicitation Studies A GES presents participants with system effects and elicits gestures that trigger those effects [ 69 , 70 ] . For example , Vatavu and Zaiţi [ 64 ] elicited mid - air gestures to control various functions of a smart TV , such as turning the TV on and off , going to the next and previous channels , etc . These system functions , or the results of user actions performed with interactive systems , are called “referents” in the GES scientific literature [ 70 ] . User - proposed input to invoke the referents takes the form of gesture commands in GESs but , for generic end - user elicitation [ 58 , 62 , 63 ] , it can represent any symbol , action , or manifestation of user preference relevant to the study and interactive system , such as key presses , voice input , prefer - ences for vibrotactile patterns , etc . The results of a GES are usually represented by a consensus gesture set , observations about user behavior with respect to the system under investigation , and design recommendations for interactive devices , applications , and systems controllable with gestures . Consensus among the elicited gestures has been calculated using agreement scores [ 69 , 70 ] , agreement and coagreement rates [ 62 , 63 ] , max - consensus and consensus - distinct ratios [ 35 ] , chance - corrected coefficients of agreement [ 56 ] , and the growth rate of the dissimilarity - consensus curve [ 60 ] ; see Vatavu and Wobbrock [ 58 ] for an overview of these measures , clarifications , and recommendations about agreement calculation in end - user elic - itation studies . Also , several tools are available to help practitioners implement GES and analyze the gestures elicited [ 5 , 6 , 34 , 62 , 63 ] . 2 . 2 Research Reproducibility Reproducibility is the cornerstone of cumulative knowledge and a requirement to confirm scientific truth [ 19 , 48 ] . Reproducibility is supported by clear descriptions of procedures , methods , experimen - tal designs , and publicly available resources . The lack of public data hinders the reproducibility , repeatability , and verifiability of exper - iments since recollecting new data may be a tedious endeavor [ 43 ] . The “reproducibility crisis” [ 50 ] denotes the situation in which sci - entific studies are difficult , if not impossible , to reproduce . Many efforts have been made to raise awareness of the importance of reproducibility in scientific research and structure it [ 19 , 39 , 40 ] , in - cluding in Computer Science [ 18 ] and HCI [ 20 , 26 , 68 ] . For example , Peng [ 40 ] considered that scientific articles are not replicable unless RepliGES and GEStory : Visual Tools for Systematizing and Consolidating Knowledge on User - Defined Gestures AVI 2022 , June 6 – 10 , 2022 , Frascati , Rome , Italy Method reproducibility Research question Gesture elicitation experiment setup Run experiment Data annotation & preprocessing Data analysis Knowledge Initial observation , prior work , application domain Gesture input reflective of user behavior Results reproducibility Inferential reproducibility Results Interpretation Design considerations and guidelines What is the purpose of the replication experiment ?

[ 19 ] ( bottom ) . their artifacts are available . The next steps are to release the source code and data [ 14 ] . Patil et al . [ 39 ] proposed a visual notation to ex - press to what extent reproducibility and replicability are addressed in a scientific article . The HCI community has also acknowledged the need for reproducible research with the RepliCHI initiative [ 68 ] but , according to the findings reported by Hornbæk et al . [ 26 ] , a replication rate of just 3 % exists in HCI . ( This rate is very close to the 4 % that we found for replications of GESs . ) Thus , the HCI community should embrace replication to advance the field [ 25 ] . Following the RepliCHI initiative , the term replication has been widely adopted in HCI , while reproducibility has been used in other fields [ 19 ] . Although an ontological confusion exists because of different terminology , this confusion is actually generalized across the entire spectrum of scientific research ; see Gomez et al . [ 18 ] that reported 27 different frameworks to classify reproducibility . A rele - vant example is the ACM [ 1 , 2 ] artifact review and badging system that specifies : “A variety of research communities have embraced the goal of reproducibility in experimental science . Unfortunately , the terminology in use has not been uniform . Because of this we find it necessary to define our terms . ” Thus , in 2018 , ACM [ 1 ] pro - posed definitions for repeatability , reproducibility , and replicability for experimental Computer Science , only to revise them in 2020 by swapping reproducibility and replicability to harmonize ACM terminology with that used by the broader scientific community [ 2 ] . In this context , we choose to remain consistent with RepliCHI terminology [ 26 , 68 ] and use replication as the umbrella term to refer to any form of reproducible research on interactions between users and computer systems , and generalization to refer to reproducible research that covers other contexts . Furthermore , we identify repur - posing as a new scenario , connected to replication , where datasets collected in prior GESs are used ( repurposed ) to generate new dis - coveries , as we have found in the GES literature [ 17 , 53 ] . In the next section , we discuss in detail specific types of replications , exten - sions , generalizations , and repurposing relevant for GESs . 3 REPLIGES To structure possible types of GES replications , we start from ( 1 ) the steps needed to conduct a GES , from the initial formulation of the research question to the interpretation of results , ( 2 ) Johansen’s [ 27 ] time - space matrix for specifying possible configurations involv - ing the same or different entities , which we connect to ACM’s [ 2 ] dimensions of team and experimental setup , and ( 3 ) existing classi - fications of reproducible research [ 1 , 2 , 19 , 26 , 40 , 57 ] . 3 . 1 Preliminaries Figure 1 , middle illustrates the steps involved by a GES . A precise specification of each step is necessary to understand what can be replicated and where replication applies . Based on the original de - scription of Wobbrock et al . ’s [ 69 ] method to maximize guessability , its first application to user - defined hand gesture input [ 70 ] , and a recent model of end - user elicitation in HCI [ 58 ] , we identify the following steps of a GES : ( 1 ) the research question is formulated based on initial observations , prior work , and / or the specifics of the application domain ; ( 2 ) the experimental setup is specified in terms of hypotheses , context of use , referents , apparatus , tasks , and procedure ; ( 3 ) the population of potential end users is sampled and participants are elicited about their preferences for gesture commands ; ( 4 ) the raw data is annotated and preprocessed ; ( 5 ) con - sensus analysis follows to identify gestures that are equivalent or substantially similar in accordance with the specifics of the appli - cation domain and the goals of the study ; ( 6 ) results are compiled in the form of a consensus gesture set and / or observations about participants’ preferences for gestures ; ( 7 ) results are interpreted and conclusions drawn ; and ( 8 ) conclusions contribute to the accu - mulation of knowledge in the community . These steps are useful to identify ways in which replications of a GES can be conducted . For example , replication can be done by reusing the same data in step ( 5 ) to verify the results of the original AVI 2022 , June 6 – 10 , 2022 , Frascati , Rome , Italy Gheran et al . study or by repurposing the data in step ( 4 ) for another goal , thus arriving at new discoveries . The study could be replicated with new participants at step ( 3 ) or with new referents at step ( 2 ) to learn whether the conclusions of the original study still hold . To structure these possible types of replication , we turn our attention to several classification schemes for reproducible research . 3 . 1 . 1 Artifacts . ACM’s [ 2 ] artifact review and badging system de - fines an artifact as “a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experi - ment itself . ” Following this definition , artifacts in GESs are the data ( i . e . , the gestures elicited ) collected from the participants . Thus , data and participants are key concepts for GES replication . Con - sequently , we differentiate among reviewing the same data ( i . e . , verifying the analysis ) , collecting new data from the same partici - pants ( i . e . , repeating the study ) and collecting new data by involving new participants ( i . e . , performing an exact replication [ 57 ] ) . 3 . 1 . 2 Team and experimental setup . ACM’s [ 2 ] system employs two dimensions , team and experimental setup , to define repeatabil - ity ( same team , same experimental setup ) , reproducibility ( different team , same experimental setup ) , and replicability ( different team , different experimental setup ) . Our previous discussion of GES ar - tifacts and focus on gesture data and participants falls under the experimental setup dimension . Next in this section , we show how the method of analysis [ 57 ] completes this dimension to specify possible types of replication for GES . However , ACM’s [ 2 ] team dimension has a limitation : the configuration “same team , differ - ent setup” is not covered , although relevant for GESs when the same authors wish to conduct a variation of their original study to expand their previous findings . For example , Soni et al . [ 53 ] ana - lyzed mental models of gestures performed on spherical displays by the participants involved in one of their previous studies [ 52 ] . To address this limitation , we draw inspiration from Johansen’s [ 27 ] time - space matrix , which we reframe with the two dimensions of ACM , team and experimental setup . However , the composition of the team 2 conducting the replication is less important than the actual experimental setup used during the replication , i . e . , whether changes have been implemented in the original method or not . 3 . 1 . 3 Types of replications . Tsang and Kwan [ 57 ] classify replica - tions on two dimensions : sources of data ( same data set , same popu - lation and different population ) and changes in the method / procedure ( same measurement and analysis , different measurement and / or analysis ) . They discuss six types of replication : checking of anal - ysis ( which corresponds to ACM’s [ 2 ] definition of repeatability ) , reanalysis of data ( different procedures are used on the same data ) , exact replication ( the same study conducted with new participants from the same population ) , conceptual extension ( new procedure applied to new participants from the same population ) , empirical generalization ( same procedure used as in the original study but on a new population ) , and generalization and extension ( new pro - cedure and new population ) . For Tsang and Kwan , the team that is involved in replication is not important , but population is . Since 2 In some cases , new researchers collaborate with the original team , while other re - searchers from the original team are not part of the follow - up study ; see [ 47 , 52 , 53 ] for examples . Such situations , occurring in practice , are not covered by ACM’s [ 1 , 2 ] categories of the same or a different team . generalizations of findings from GESs to other populations ( e . g . , from adults to children [ 47 , 52 , 70 ] ) are valuable and insightful to consolidate knowledge about user - defined gestures , we adopt the population dimension in our RepliGES space next to data and par - ticipants by considering the scenario where new data are collected from participants sampled from a population different from the one from the original GES ; see the horizontal axis of Figure 2 . 3 . 1 . 4 Types of reproducibility . Goodman et al . [ 19 ] highlighted three types of reproducibility : ( I ) method reproducibility strives to make the data and experimental setup fully accessible so that the experiment can be repeated ; ( II ) if the experiment can be repeated with the same results , results reproducibility is accomplished ; and ( III ) inferential reproducibility describes the situation where the same conclusion is drawn from the replication . These types of reproducibility apply to a GES at steps ( 2 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) , respectively , and are highlighted at the bottom of Figure 1 . 3 . 2 The RepliGES Conceptual Space Based on the above considerations , we identify the following types of replication for GESs ( see Figure 2 ) : ( 1 ) Repeatability . The data from the original study is reanalyzed with the same method to verify whether the same results are obtained again . This type of replication , denoted with symbol ( 1 ) in Figure 2 , connects to Tsang and Kwan’s [ 57 ] “checking of analysis” and ACM’s [ 2 ] definition of “repeata - bility . ” One frequent use in GESs is when several researchers from the same team code the gestures independently , af - ter which an inter - rater reliability test is applied to confirm the consistency of the coding . For example , in their study about user - defined gestures for deformable displays , Troiano et al . [ 55 ] described their procedure as follows : “After the coding manual was finalized , one author coded all the tasks , while a second author independently coded a sub - set of tasks ( 10 % of the whole set ) . An inter - rater reliability analysis was performed using Cohen’s Kappa statistic to determine con - sistency among raters” ( p . 4 ) . Checking of analysis can also happen at a later time by the same or a different team . ( 2 ) Reproducibility . The elicitation data from the original study is revisited with a new method of analysis . This type of replication ( symbol ( 2 ) in Figure 2 ) employs the research question and data from the original study and the team ver - ifies whether the results can be obtained again , but with new methods . Tsang and Kwan [ 57 ] note that “quite often the replication involves using more powerful statistical tech - niques that were not available when the original study was conducted” ( p . 766 ) . The team can be an independent one ( ac - cording to ACM’s [ 2 ] reproducibility ) , but also the same team may wish to revisit their data with a new method ( i . e . , Tsang and Kwan’s [ 57 ] “reanalysis of data” ) . Relevant examples are Vatavu and Wobbrock [ 58 , 62 , 63 ] and Tsandilas [ 56 ] . ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) Replicability . The team collects new data , either from the same participants of the original study ( 3 ) or new participants ( 4 ) ( 5 ) . Examples of the former ( 3 ) are Nacenta et al . [ 37 ] and Schipor and Vatavu [ 49 ] that recalled their participants after twenty - four hours . Replicability conducted by applying a new method at a later time with the same participants ( 4 ) RepliGES and GEStory : Visual Tools for Systematizing and Consolidating Knowledge on User - Defined Gestures AVI 2022 , June 6 – 10 , 2022 , Frascati , Rome , Italy new data same method new method same participants new participants Vatavu & Wobbrock ( 2015 , 2016 ) , Tsandilas ( 2018 ) 5 Nacenta et al .

( 2014 ) empirical generalization generalization and extension repurposing and extension empirical repurposing Soni et al . ( 2019 ) Figure 2 : The RepliGES conceptual space for gesture elicitation studies . is probably the most challenging , if not impossible , type of replication since the participants may not be available any longer or , when they are , some aspect of the study will have probably changed over time . According to Tsang and Kwan [ 57 ] , “Strictly speaking , the same study can never be repeated by a different researcher , or even by the same researcher” ( p . 756 ) . In another instance of replicability ( 5 ) , the research team collects new data from new participants to verify if the results from the original study still hold , i . e . , an “exact replication” [ 57 ] or a “strict replication” [ 26 ] . So far we have focused on GES replications . Next , we build on Tsang and Kwan’s [ 57 ] dimensions of the sources of data and the method to specify extensions and generalizations of GES findings : ( 6 ) Extensibility . The team employs a new method on data col - lected from new participants , i . e . , they perform a “conceptual extension” [ 57 ] of the original study . For example , Nebeling et al . [ 38 ] replicated Morris’ [ 35 ] “web on the wall” study with several variations of the original method : a system im - plementation , a custom software for recording and analyzing multimodal interactions , and a mixed - initiative elicitation procedure . Another example is Hoff et al . [ 24 ] that adapted and tested two techniques previously proposed to reduce legacy bias [ 36 ] , i . e . , production and priming . ( 7 ) Generalizability . The research team runs the study by employ - ing the original method , but with a sample of participants from another population to check whether the original find - ings generalize to the new population . One example is Rust et al . [ 47 ] that reimplemented Wobbrock et al . ’s [ 70 ] study on tabletop interaction by eliciting gestures from children . 3 ( 8 ) Extensibility and generalizability . The research team uses a new method on new gestures elicited from a new population . 3 Adaptations were adopted to make the experiment protocol work for children . An example is Soni et al . [ 52 ] that examined gestures per - formed by children and adults on spherical displays and com - pared them to gestures performed on flat tabletops [ 47 , 70 ] . Besides the above categories , our survey of the GES literature revealed two studies [ 17 , 53 ] in which gestures elicited by previous work [ 16 , 52 ] were reused for another purpose . This specific type of reutilization of previously collected data for another goal is not covered by the ACM [ 2 ] or Tsang and Kwan’s [ 57 ] classifications , the two main sources that have informed our RepliGES space so far . Nevertheless , reusing data is relevant for consolidating knowledge about user - defined gestures since it has the potential to generate new results , complementary to those from the original study that collected the data . Such studies can be performed by the same team or by an independent team . To reflect the change in goal without the effort of collecting new data , we use the term repurposability 4 and complete our RepliGES space as follows : ( 9 ) Repurposability for the same population . The gesture data from a previous GES are employed for a new goal to discover something new about the same population . For example , Gheran et al . [ 17 ] reused ring gestures elicited in [ 16 ] to model bimanual gestures using temporal calculus . Soni et al . [ 53 ] reused the dataset from [ 52 ] to analyze users’ mental models for interactions with spherical displays . ( 10 ) Repurposability for a new population . An interesting case of repurposability is when the team employs a previously col - lected gesture dataset , elicited from participants belonging to one population , to arrive at new discoveries that apply to a different population . We did not find any example of this scenario applied to GESs , but we point to Leiva et al . [ 31 ] , 4 Just like the use of the term in computer programming ; see https : / / www . jefftk . com / p / programming - repurposeability . AVI 2022 , June 6 – 10 , 2022 , Frascati , Rome , Italy Gheran et al . Figure 3 : The GEStory interactive design space implemented as a web application . who used the Kinematic Theory to synthesize stroke ges - tures with the articulation characteristics of users with visual impairments from gestures collected from people without visual impairments . Although their study was conducted on gestures collected in response to visual stimuli instead of being elicited for specific referents as in a GES , Leiva et al . ’s work represents the closest example of repurposability of gesture data applied to a new population and , we believe , is inspiring to foster similar work in GESs . 4 GESTORY GEStory ( Figure 3 ) is an interactive design space [ 23 ] that struc - tures gestures according to a domain model reproduced in Figure 4 . To support the visualization of gesture - related information , dy - namic query filters are tightly coupled with a starfield display [ 3 ] of the human body . In this way , gestures are shown in correspondence to the body limbs used for their articulation . For example , Figure 3 shows a dynamic query of hand gestures . GEStory returns all of the gestures reported by previously published GESs , and couples the results with a starfield display superimposed on the human body ; see Figure 3 . When a gesture is selected , the dimensions according to which that gesture is characterized are shown below . • Body part specifies the part ( s ) of the human body that are involved in gesture articulation according to the limb classi - fication introduced by Villarreal et al . [ 65 ] for GESs : finger , hand , writs , arm , shoulder , head , foot , and torso . • Device specifies the device or sensor used for gesture acqui - sition . According to the sensing technique , devices fall into one of the following categories : touch or contact - based de - vices and contact - less or vision - based devices . When custom - built devices are used , the “Prototype” slot is highlighted in GEStory . For example , a smartwatch can be used as a contact - based device or a contact - less sensor . • User specifies the category or profile of the target users addressed by a GES , e . g . , children [ 47 , 52 ] . • Task specifiesthe referentsfromaGESaccordingtoLenorovitz et al . ’s [ 32 ] classification of actions and Aigner et al . ’s [ 4 ] classification of tasks : constructive action , scale , next ob - ject / action , previous object / action , draw an object , rotate an object , increase / decrease a value , activate or deactivate an object or an action , and OK / cancel . This list can be extended to accommodate other types of tasks as well . • Gesture type specifies the gesture category according to Aigner et al . ’s [ 4 ] classification of gestures : pointing , static or static semaphoric , pantomimic , static or dynamic iconic RepliGES and GEStory : Visual Tools for Systematizing and Consolidating Knowledge on User - Defined Gestures AVI 2022 , June 6 – 10 , 2022 , Frascati , Rome , Italy 1 , n 1 , n Gesture GestureIdGestureNameGestureRepresentationGestureImageGestureTypeGestureFormGestureNatureGestureSymmetryGestureLocaleAgreement 1 , n 1 , n 1 , n Referent RefIDRefNameRefRepresentationRefGeneric 1 , n FunctionSubType TaskIDTaskNameTaskDesc FunctionType TypeIDTaskSetNameTaskSetDesc Environment EnvIDEnvNameEnvDesc Process ProsessIDProsessNamePreTestTest PosTestConsolidation 1 , n 0 , n 1 , n GEStudy StudyIdStudyTitleYearPublishedURLAuthorsStrengthOfEvidenceReplication GeneralizationRepurposing Replication , Generalization , Repurposing 0 , n 0 , n 1 , n User UserIdNumberSDAgeMeansAgeMFRatio 0 , n Device DeviceIDDeviceNameDeviceDesc 0 , n 1 0 , n BodyPart BodyPartIdBodyPartNameBodyPartDescLocation 1 0 , n 1 , n Is replication of , Is generalization of , Is repurposing of Figure 4 : The domain model used for GEStory . and manipulative gestures . For example , pointing refers to gestures that indicate an object , person , or direction that are usually performed , but not always , with the index finger . • Gesture form indicates whether the gesture is static , e . g . , a hand pose , or dynamic , e . g . , a mid - air hand gesture . • Gesture nature specifies the nature of the gesture according to Kendon’s [ 28 ] continuum . • Symmetry indicates whether the gesture exhibits any form of body symmetry according to Guiard’s [ 21 ] kinematic chain model : unilateral ( involving one side ) , bilateral symmetric ( involving two sides in a symmetric way ) , and bilateral asym - metric ( two sides in a different way ) . For example , the gesture depicted in Figure 3 is unilateral . • Locale specifies the centricity of the gesture : object - centric when the gesture is based on an object , body - centric , when it refers to a part of the human body , in - the - air , or mixed when several locales are combined . • Year specifies the publication year of the GES results . GEStory is publicly available as a web - based application at the web address https : / / sites . uclouvain . be / GEStory . The GitHub repos - itory documents the implementation in HTML5 , JavaScript , and Vue . js 5 . JSON files implement the database of GEStory . Each GES is also fully stored with its bibliographic reference extracted from the Zotero collection of Villarreal et al . [ 65 ] : title , authors , venue , editors , year of publication , and DOI . Dimensions User , Task , and Device cover the typical dimensions that characterize the context of use [ 10 ] . 5 https : / / vuejs . org / v2 / guide 5 A SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE REVIEW OF GES REPLICATIONS To identify GES replications , we turned to reviews of the scien - tific literature on GESs . Vuletic et al . [ 54 ] conducted a Systematic Literature Review ( SLR ) on hand gestures for user interfaces ; Vo - giatzidakis and Koutsabasis [ 66 ] conducted a review of GESs for mid - air interaction , followed by a SLR [ 29 ] with a corpus of 47 papers ; and Villarreal et al . [ 65 ] conducted a SLR of 216 GESs with a Zotero collection 6 that was made publicly available . Using these sources , we found only ten papers , a mere 4 % of the 216 studies examined in [ 65 ] , which are highlighted in the RepliGES space in Figure 2 and detailed in Figure 6 . VatavuandWobbrock [ 62 , 63 ] reusedthegesturedatasetsfrom [ 41 , 59 , 64 ] to exemplify the use of the AGATe toolkit . Tsandilas [ 56 ] performed reanalysis of the data from [ 7 , 11 , 30 , 67 ] with different statistical methods . Nebeling et al . [ 38 ] replicated the “Web on the Wall” study by Morris [ 35 ] to highlight the importance of follow - ing up a GES with implementations of actual gesture recognizers , user interfaces , or interactive systems informed by the findings of the GES . Nacenta et al . [ 37 ] and Schipor and Vatavu [ 49 ] involved participants in subsequent sessions to assess the precision of their memory recall . Hoff et al . [ 24 ] addressed the aspect of legacy bias in gesture elicitation [ 36 ] . Gheran et al . [ 17 ] reused the smart ring gestures elicited by [ 16 ] to model bimanual gesture input with tem - poral calculus . And Soni et al . [ 52 , 53 ] examined gestures produced by children and adults on spherical and flat touch displays and discussed their findings with respect to prior work [ 47 , 70 ] . 6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK We introduced the RepliGES conceptual space to address several shortcomings ( S 1 to S 6 ) about the body of knowledge accumu - lated on user - defined gestures in the scientific literature . Based on RepliGES , we developed GEStory , an interactive design space to structure , visualize , and query user - defined gestures reported by 216 GESs , which we demonstrated by identifying a set of replicated GESs . Our results have implications for the practice of end - user gesture elicitation , in support of which we provide replicability criteria and recommendations for researchers and practitioners . With these tools , the body of knowledge on user - defined gestures is concentrated in one single point of contact ( S 1 ) , where gestures are systematically specified with a unified format ( S 2 ) in a consistent manner ( S 3 ) and that is structured according to a domain model ( S 5 ) to identify RepliGES links between different published GESs . RepliGES and GEStory are mainly intended for designers and developers of gesture - based user interfaces , who can rely on the gesture database concentrated by GEStory and the replication op - portunities identified by RepliGES to gain new insights and obtain new information in their specific application domain . RepliGES and GEStory are also intended for researchers to inform new ex - periments and studies toward the discovery of new gestures , but also to confirm or disconfirm existing GES findings . The interactive design space of RepliGES can be used to inform and support the design of specific gesture types since it incorporates dimensions that specify constraints and trade - offs relevant to gesture - based 6 https : / / www . zotero . org / groups / 2132650 / gesture _ elicitation _ studies AVI 2022 , June 6 – 10 , 2022 , Frascati , Rome , Italy Gheran et al .

Finally , GEStory is also intended for historians of user interfaces since it captures the evolution of gestures reported by GESs . The repository of GEStory is valuable to anyone interested in the evolution of gestures for interactive applications . In future work , we plan replications of GESs for specific devices , e . g . , electronic rings [ 16 ] , or addressing specific user categories , e . g . , people with motor impairments [ 15 ] . Findings from these stud - ies and replications will also allow us to understand more closely aspects of the end - user gesture elicitation method , e . g . , the impact of the analysis method on the results or the generalizability of the results for other user populations and contexts of use .
