Star Wars Day creative visuals collected on Twitter from ( a ) McDonald’s , ( b ) Volkswagen , and ( c ) Girl Scouts Pop culture is a pervasive and important aspect of communication and self - expression . When people wish to communicate using pop culture references , they need to find connections between their message and the things , people , location and actions of a movie , tv series , or other pop culture domain . However , finding an appropriate match from memory is challenging and search engines are not specific enough to the task . Often domain - specific knowledge graphs provide the structure , specificity and search capabilities that people need . We introduce PopNet - a Pop Culture Knowledge Association Network automatically created from plain text using state - of - the art NLP methods to extract entities and actions from text summaries of movies and tv shows . The interface allows people to browse and search the entries to find connections . We conduct a study showing that this system is accurate and helpful for finding multiple connections between a message and a pop culture domain .

H C ] 9 N ov 2021 , , Wang and Chilton connections between the user’s topic and pop culture . For example , on Star Wars Day many organizations form connections between their messages and Star Wars and create an image to post on social media . This is done by companies like BMW , government organizations like NASA , nonprofits like The Met Museum and the Girl Scouts of America . It is done for many pop culture domains , particularly when a new season of a show begins . No matter what the organization or pop culture domain , they seem to be able to find creative ways to link their message to the domain . When creating an image with pop culture references , there are two challenges : finding a domain - related entity or action that connects to the message , and then finding associated entities to “fill the scene” and enhance the message . To find a good match , it is helpful to find many possible options for the user to search and browse . To fill the scene , it is helpful to know associated entities and actions to select . This could be objects , people , locations , organizations , and actions from the pop culture domain . In creativity , these steps are called divergent and convergent thinking . Divergent thinking is often difficult because it requires users to recall multiple things from memory . Convergent thinking is difficult because it requires trying multiple combinations to meet the constraints of the problem . To address the challenges of divergent and convergent thinking in creating pop culture connections , we present PopNet - a knowledge association network listing entities and associations within a given pop culture domain . For example , given Star Wars movies 4 , 5 , and 6 as a pop culture domain , it extracts the entities ( people , locations , organiza - tions , and objects ) and actions of those movies . Beyond being simply a database or a knowledge graph , we identify the common associations between the entities and present canonical images for each of them . PopNet uses plain text plot summaries from Wikipedia , and uses state - of - the - art Natural Language Processing to construct a knowledge graph . It then further processes the summaries for co - occurrence data to determine associations between entities and their strengths . Although knowledge bases and association networks exist for general information , to our knowledge this is the first knowledge base or association network with rich pop culture knowledge . Additionally , although there is a wealth of pop culture knowledge on fan - created wikis , it is not structured in ways that support finding creative connections . This paper makes the following contributions : • PopNet : a knowledge association network for pop culture domains which is automatically created from plain text plot summaries . • An interface that allows users to search and browse PopNet within a domain to support divergent and convergent thinking . • An evaluation showing the users prefer using PopNet to web search when making PopRef images . We conclude with a discussion of how to extend this work to other forms of pop culture and how knowledge association networks can support finding connections in other creative tasks . 2 TASK : POPREF IMAGES Although pop culture references are pervasive , to investigate supporting creative connections to pop culture we focus on a single task . The task we chose is to create images for a message with multiple references to a single pop culture domain . We call these PopRef images . Figure 1 shows three examples of PopRef images for the Star Wars domain . They are all advertisements posted on May 4 for " Star Wars Day . " Diverse companies like McDonald’s , Volkswagon and The Girl Scouts of America were each able to produce a different image that relates to their products . A key challenge in this task is to have multiple , cohesive references to the a single domain . For example , in the McDonald’s ad , the image references Luke’s hand pulling a lightsaber out of snow on the planet Hoth . Likewise , the 2 PopNet : a Pop Culture Knowledge Association Network for Supporting Creative Connections , , Volkswagon ad has references to Han Solo , Chewbacca , the Millennium Falcon . In the ad for Girl Scout Cookies , Luke and Darth Vader are fighting with lightsabers . Although it is possible to use only a single reference , the images seem more clever when there are multiple cohesive connections . This task is related to visual metaphors [ 17 , 52 ] a commonly studied creative design challenge and which several systems support creating [ 12 , 13 , 28 ] . It does blend ideas from two domains in to single image to express new meaning but it does not strictly need to be a metaphor - any connection is fine . Unlike visual metaphors , PopRef images must have multiple connections to the pop culture domain . 3 RELATED WORK 3 . 1 Knowledge Graphs and Association Data Knowledge graphs are a powerful tool for accessing structured information . They are often used by search engines and question answering services to deliver direct responses to users queries for facts about the world . From 2016 - 2020 , interest in domain - specific knowledge graphs has increased dramatically with many applications in Health , Education , Telecommunications , Science and Business [ 1 ] . One potential reason for this increase is advances in NLP [ 20 ] that enable automatically constructing high quality knowledge graphs . Creating and maintaining knowledge bases by hand is often prohibitively expensive . But the potential to do it automatically makes opens many new applications . Existing knowledge graphs cover a broad range of human knowledge , but do not cover popular culture in any reasonable depth . WordNet [ 39 ] and ConceptNet [ 35 ] are wildly used knowledge graphs , but focus almost exclusively on words in the dictionary , which excludes popular culture . Databases like DBPedia [ 7 ] cover everything in Wikipedia and thus do have pop culture entries , but the focus is on facts about entities in movies , rather than the role they play in the movie . Google Knowledge Graph has pop culture knowledge , but has uneven coverage for pop culture ; it has entries for “characters in Friends” but not in Star Wars or Game of Thrones . Fan - created wikis for pop culture domains do contain a massive amount of entities . However , the focus is on creating articles for people to read and the meta data and other structured information is not always complete or useful . Like knowledge graphs , association networks store related entities or concepts , however unlike knowledge graphs , the only link between the entities is how closely associated they are . A high quality source of associations is Small World of Words [ 14 ] - a crowdsourced dataset of word associations . Unfortunately , this association data set and others like WordAssociations . net tend to have little or no popular culture entities in them . Word embeddings [ 38 , 41 ] are a potential source of word associations that could be generated automatically . Word embeddings trained on internet corpuses often have popular culture entities in them , however , there is no guarantee of coverage . Moreover , human evaluations show that the contents of word associations dataset produce more related and similar words than word embeddings , and more closely match our “mental lexicon . ” [ 15 ] . A common way of producing associations is to calculate at co - occurrence within a given window size [ 18 , 50 , 60 ] . For PopNet , we found this was a simple and reliable source of automatically generating associations within our knowledge graph . 3 . 2 Supporting connections in creativity Psychologists consider association an essential part of the creative process [ 36 ] . The famous mathematician Poincare posited that “to create consists of making new combinations by providing mediating connective links” . This insight is captured in the popular model of creativity as being divided into divergent thinking and convergent thinking [ 51 ] . During divergent phase , the goal is to come up with many possible useful pieces . During the convergent phase , those 3 , , Wang and Chilton pieces come together in ways that achieve the goal . These phase are used together in many combinations to perform creative work and problem solving [ 16 ] . They are both difficult tasks that can be supported with computational tools . Divergent thinking is difficult because it requires recalling multiple diverse associations from memory . Knowledge graphs are commonly used to present text inspiration . InspirationWall [ 5 ] is a brainstorming support system that presents a related topics from a knowledge graph . Spinneret [ 8 ] helps people build mind maps with non - obvious associations from ConceptNet . Metaphoria [ 21 ] helps people make metaphorical connections using ConceptNet and ranking the results with word embeddings . Other approaches to presenting text inspiration are to use word embeddings [ 31 ] , association data [ 28 , 43 ] , or a real - time crowd [ 6 , 48 ] . Presenting images to users during a brainstrom can further spur associations [ 47 , 53 ] and those image can be optimized for preference [ 32 ] or adapted to cultural context [ 54 ] . All these approaches are valid and helpful for supporting divergent thinking . In PopNet combine three of these approaches - knowledge graphs , associations and images to help people find ideas . Convergent thinking is difficult because it requires synthesizing many pieces of information into a cohesive output . Creative design tasks are ill defined , and thus there is no exact formula to converge on a solution , but there are several ways to help ease the cognitive load . Rapid prototyping tools [ 12 , 24 , 25 , 56 ] create a layer of abstraction over low level hardware or software details to help users focus on the combining the ideas rather than fiddling with mechanics . They also present an environment where all the tools are ready - to - hand . In design , having a well - curated environment is sometimes called mise - en - place [ 40 , 55 ] . When there are known constraints for a solution , software systems can help search the parts to find combinations that meet the constraints [ 2 – 4 , 33 , 37 ] or adhere to expert design principles [ 13 , 27 , 29 , 46 , 61 ] or schemas [ 22 , 26 ] . When computational approaches fail , crowd workflows can be constructed to guide worker to do recombination [ 59 ] , analogical reasoning [ 57 , 58 ] , or synthesis [ 11 , 30 , 45 ] . For the PopRef Image task , it is easiest to see it as problem with multiple constraints - the user must find multiple references to a pop culture domain that all go together cohesively . To support people making these connections we offer two solutions : 1 ) semantic search to automatically search the database to find an initial reference , and 2 ) an environment with structured and associative links ready - to - hand for finding related entities to fill the scene . 4 POPNET SYSTEM For PopNet we combine structured knowledge with associations to generate a network then can be easily explored for creative tasks . Based on a survey of research on creating knowledge graphs , there is a generally accepted way of using NLP to construct knowledge graphs from plain text [ 1 ] . First parse the text into sentences . Second , use Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) to extract entities and their types . Third , use Information Extraction ( IE ) to find links . Lastly , store the links as triplets . Sometimes , co - reference resolution is advised before NER and IE . Sometimes dependency parsing is recommended to extract non - named entities , although it becomes complicated to extract entities from their surrounding noun phrase . For PopNet , we follow these steps , using Wikipedia plot summaries as the input text , using AllenNLP [ 19 ] as a source of high quality NER and IE , and we opt to use conference resolution before NER and IE . Details about each step are as follows . 4 . 1 Knowledge Association Network Creation 4 . 1 . 1 Input Data Collection . We scrape plot sections in pop culture domains’ wiki page ( s ) ( e . g . , Star Wars trilogy , Game of Thrones season 1 - 8 ) as the data resource . Data from wiki pages have advantages of being generalizable , updated and relatively structured . We choose the plot section to scrape because plot is “a narrative sequence of events that determine the outcome of the character” , which in other words , is a concise expression covering most entities and their 4 PopNet : a Pop Culture Knowledge Association Network for Supporting Creative Connections , , important events . We also consider other alternatives including 1 ) Fandom wiki pages , which are compiled by fans and cover many pop culture domains but being highly unstructured and too detailed ; 2 ) Small World of Words and ConceptNet , which can associate specific entities to a domain , but barely having nothing for the pop culture domain ; 3 ) Google knowledge graph , which lets users find richer meaning about a concept , but currently having nothing for a specific pop culture domain either . 4 . 1 . 2 Entity Extraction ( Nodes ) . We then extract entities based on the scraped plot sections . To extract entities from the plot text , we first run ELMo - based named entity recognition model to get named entities ( “referents of proper nouns and other noun phrases” ) with tags of people , organizations , locations and miscellaneous , which are a large part of entities we want . ELMo - based model achieves 99 % accuracy and 96 % F1 on the CoNLL - 2003 validation set [ 42 ] . However , we also want non - named entities such as lightsabers in Star Wars and dragons in Game of Thrones , and we do it with a different approach . Using an extra 100 random wiki pages as the corpus , we run the TF - IDF method to extract non - named entities . TF - IDF is a common technique to statically extract important ( frequent in the domain and rare in others ) vocabularies for a domain document . After that , we merge the named and non - named entities , and finally get the entity list for the pop culture domain . 4 . 1 . 3 Entity Association and Action Extraction ( Edges ) . Based on the entity list , we then want to figure out associations between these entities . To start with , we target entity pairs co - occurring in the same sentence of the plot , because entities showing in one sentence are highly likely to appear in the same event , which means being highly related . Before finding co - occurring entity pairs , we take a pre - processing step of co - reference resolution , which means replacing pronouns in the plot with specific entity names . This step is aimed at preventing associations from being ignored because of non - specific pronouns . We run SpanBERT embedding model [ 34 ] provided on AllenNLP to achieve this goal . Then we extract the entity pairs co - occuring in the same sentence based on the text after co - reference resolution . Now that we have co - occurring entity pairs as associative nodes , we want to further investigate what relationships are between them . We use open information extraction ( open IE ) model for this task to break complex plot sentences into a list of propositions , each composed of a single predicate and some arguments . If one entity is in ARG0 and another is in ARG1 of the predicate , we consider predicate ( verb / action ) here as the linkage between the two entities . In other words , we extract subject - verb - object relations with both subject and object being entities in our list . The BiLMSTM model from AllenNLP [ 49 ] is used to automatically complete the open IE . 4 . 1 . 4 Entity Ranking and Image Collection . Following the three steps above , a knowledge association graph has been constructed for the pop culture domain . However , to make it easier for users to explore , we need to collect extra information . Some pop culture domains , such as Game of Thrones , have a large number of entities in their stories . It will be difficult for a user to explore the network if the entities ( nodes ) are shown in a random order . Thus we consider ranking the entities based on their " importance " or " popularity " . We first consider using page count of the entity’s Google search result as the measure of their popularity . However , we find this approach not reliable for pop culture domains with real - world scenarios , especially for the ranking of characters . For example , with aim of finding the " popularity " of David ( a supporting character in Friends ) , we searched " Friends + David " in Google and ended up with a surprisingly high page number . It did not improve after we added " TV show " as another constraint keyword , and it is because one of the main character’s actor is also named David and has a high popularity . To find a more generalizable way , we return to plot texts we have ( with co - references resolved ) and use TF - IDF approach ( as we did to extract 5 , , Wang and Chilton Fig . 2 . 3 - level pages of PopNet Interface ( a ) overview page , ( b ) association page , ( c ) detailed page non - named entities ) to rank the entities . It is a simple but relatively reliable way to sort the entities , as the frequently mentioned entities in the domain ( and rare in other random wiki pages ) have their place in the movie or TV show . To give users more information beyond just texts of entity names and actions , related images are scraped from Google Image API with certain keywords . We scrape entity images with the keyword of “ [ pop culture domain name ] + [ entity name ] ” . We also scrape images for entity pairs with the keyword of “ [ pop culture name ] + [ entity1 name ] + [ entity2 name ] + scene” . We add the keyword “scene” because we find this combination is most likely to get related images , after experiments with other candidates such as “moment” and “shot” . 4 . 2 PopNet Interface for Browsing and Semantic Search We implement a simple interface for users to explore the knowledge association network we built in the previous section . The interface mainly contains three levels of pages - overview page , association page and detailed page . A BERT - powered semantic search bar is also added for better exploration . 4 . 2 . 1 Overview Page . The overview page has five rows , each representing one category in the knowledge association network , which are namely people , organizations , locations , objects ( others ) and actions . Entries of each row are sorted and tagged with their name and ranking within the type . Entity images are shown as intuitive visual cues and are clickable as the entrance to next level - association page . Actions row are supplemented with subject - verb - object phrases , where entities are tagged with the hyperlink to their association page . 4 . 2 . 2 Association Page . Each entity in the knowledge network has their own association page . The association page first shows more pictures of the entity , and then with the same structure of overview page , shows entities and actions related to this entity under different types , which are ranked with their linkage strength . Entity pair images are shown as intuitive visual cues and are clickable as the entrance to third level - detailed page . Detailed page simply shows more pictures of entity pairs and the sentences that the two entities are co - occurring with actions highlighted . This page is aimed to giving users more details if they cannot recall what happens between the entity pair they choose . 6 PopNet : a Pop Culture Knowledge Association Network for Supporting Creative Connections , , 4 . 2 . 3 Semantic Search . To enhance the exploration experience of PopNet interface , we add a semantic search bar at the right corner of each page . The search bar is powered by the Siamese BERT - Networks [ 44 ] , which efficiently creates BERT embeddings for queries and source sentences , as well as performs fast distance calculation for semantic search . We use two types of data as the source sentences : 1 ) entity names and 2 ) subject verb object phrases we have through the domain . As the user puts in query keyword ( s ) , PopNet will search through both types of source sentences and return top five results ( with matching percentage and category tag ) for each . We also add exact matching of keyword on top of this network with sentences in the plot summaries . 5 EVALUATION 5 . 1 Methodology We recruited 10 graduate students ( 5 female and 5 male , with an average age of 24 . 0 , all design novices ) via email and word - of - mouth in a local university . The criterion was that participants were familiar with at least one of the pop culture domains we provided . They were asked to pick one domain of their favorite to use in the study . Distribution of their choice ended up with Harry Potter ( 3 ; P1 , P2 and P4 ) , Game of Thrones ( 2 ; P9 and P10 ) , Friends ( 3 ; P3 , P7 and P8 ) and Breaking Bad ( 2 ; P5 and P6 ) , covering movies and TV shows with fictional or real - world settings . During the experiment , each participant was asked to make PopRef images for four topics related to a product or PSA : 1 ) Oreo cookie ; 2 ) BMW car ; 3 ) Eat vegetables ; 4 ) Wash your hands . By using PopNet or Baseline , they were required to use references from the pop culture domain of their choice to convey the topics . Basic concepts of PopRef image design and PopNet usage were introduced with an Star Wars example by one of the researchers . During the 10 minutes of ideating for each topic , participants were given a notepad to record their ideas and encouraged to think of as many ideas as possible . After the task session , participants completed a questionnaire that covered NASA - TLX [ 23 ] , creativity support index [ 10 ] , and use of PopNet features . A 10 - min semi - constructed interview was followed right after to collect comments regarding their experience . In the end , participants were asked to make a slide for each of their ideas , which should contain a tagline and some images arranged to “get the point” of what pop culture reference they use to convey the topic . Once they finished with the slides , the whole process ended . In terms of the order of using systems , the 10 users were evenly grouped into two combinations : 1 ) Oreo cookie ( Baseline ) - BMW car ( PopNet ) - Eat vegetables ( Baseline ) - Wash your hands ( PopNet ) and 2 ) Oreo cookie ( PopNet ) - BMW car ( Baseline ) - Eat vegetables ( PopNet ) - Wash your hands ( Baseline ) . We chose Google search as our baseline as it is commonly used by designers to do creative tasks . 5 . 2 Results 5 . 2 . 1 Workload Estimates of Making PopRef Images with PopNet and Google . NASA - TLX is a standard scale to obtain workload estimates of task performers , measuring from dimensions of mental demand , physical demand , temporal demand , performance , effort and frustration [ 23 ] . With Google search engine as baseline , we hypothesize that users find PopNet easier to use during the PopRef image design tasks . Results of the NASA - TLX questionnaire are shown in Table 1 . Users felt they performed very significantly better with PopNet than with Google , reporting an average value of performance of 2 . 40 with PopNet and 3 . 30 with Google ( 𝑡 = 3 . 52 , 𝑝 = . 003 ) . By browsing and searching the domain - specific knowledge network , users more successfully found associations they needed to " fill the scene " , achieving the main goal of the PopRef image tasks . Also , mental demand ( 𝑡 = 3 . 17 , 𝑝 = . 029 ) , effort ( 𝑡 = 2 . 39 , 𝑝 = . 020 ) and frustration ( 𝑡 = 2 . 03 , 𝑝 = . 037 ) were significantly lower for PopNet compared to Google .

Google results with low relevance often brought a dead end to users’ ideas , making them feel frustrated . On the contrary , PopNet “provides information with higher information - noise rate” ( P10 ) , decreasing lots of burden from the user side . Similarly , temporal demand ( 𝑡 = 2 . 01 , 𝑝 = . 038 ) was significantly lower for PopNet compared to Google . This was likely because it often took more time for users to browse and filter the results returned by Google , and users were more easily stuck in coming up with useful keywords and felt time pressured . Finally , users felt it was less physically demanding when they used PopNet ( 3 . 00 ) compared to Google ( 3 . 20 ) , but the difference was not significant ( 𝑡 = 0 . 31 , 𝑝 = . 382 ) , as in both cases they needed to browse , search and write ideas on the notepad . 5 . 2 . 2 Creativity Support Index of PopNet and Google . Creativity support index ( CSI ) is a quantifiable measure to evaluate a creativity support tool’s ability to engage users with creative work . CSI includes six dimensions : exploration , expressiveness , immersion , enjoyment , results worth effort , and collaboration [ 10 ] . We removed the collaboration dimension in the questionnaire , as our task should be completed independently and did not involve any form of collaboration . We hypothesize that users find PopNet engages them more to do the task in terms of the CSI dimensions , compared to Google . Statistics of CSI are listed in Table 2 , where the index for each of the 5 dimensions is in the range of 0 - 20 . Generally , PopNet gets a higher average index from users in all the five dimensions compared to the baseline of Google . Users enjoyed using PopNet ( 13 . 60 ) more to do the visual design task than Google ( 12 . 70 ) but without significant difference ( 𝑡 = - 0 . 764 , 𝑝 = . 232 ) . This is likely because Google is a popular searching tool that many people are already familiar with and use on a regular basis . For the exploration dimension , PopNet ( 15 . 40 ) outperformed Google ( 11 . 20 ) 8 PopNet : a Pop Culture Knowledge Association Network for Supporting Creative Connections , , with significant difference ( 𝑡 = - 2 . 585 , 𝑝 = . 015 ) . Users found it easier to explore and track different ideas and possibilities with the help of PopNet . As P1 explained during the interview , “By having tons of related visual or text cues , PopNet helped me get out of stuck with thinking of accurate keywords , and it was easy to track the idea following the association links” . Due to similar reasons , users found PopNet ( 13 . 60 ) allowed them to be more expressive and creative compared to Google ( 11 . 10 ) with a significant difference ( 𝑡 = - 1 . 872 , 𝑝 = . 047 ) . In terms of immersion dimension , PopNet ( 10 . 00 ) has a slightly higher score than Google ( 9 . 70 ) but without significant difference ( 𝑡 = - 0 . 228 , 𝑝 = . 412 ) . Some users found PopNet less immersive to use as it was a new system they never got touch with before , and it was harder for them to use PopNet without thinking compared to Google . Finally , it was reported that users were significantly more satisfied ( 𝑡 = - 2 . 389 , 𝑝 = . 020 ) with the results they got out of PopNet ( 15 . 50 ) than of Google ( 12 . 70 ) , matching with the result of performance dimension in NASA - TLX . 5 . 2 . 3 User Experience of PopNet Interface . In the questionnaire , we collected users’ opinions about their experience with three main features of PopNet Interface : overview page , association page and search bar . All users claimed that they at least occasionally used these three features . Most of them used overview page and association page more often than search bar . As for the reasons of using the overview page , half of the participants ( P3 , P4 , P5 , P7 and P10 ) mentioned that it was helpful to browse the overview page because of its clear classification and informative content of importance to the pop culture domain . Based on our observation , participants often used overview page as the " starting point " of each of their ideas , which supported their divergent thinking of relating a pop culture domain to many specific things . After picking a thing of their interest , users usually turned to the association page to find links around it . “ ( It was ) really helpful to see ranked pairing things on the association page , as otherwise I would be lost in thinking of connections that fit into the scene myself” , as P5 said during the interview . While the overview page supported divergent thinking , the association page helped more with convergent thinking of landing on meaningful associative thing ( s ) to compose the target scene . Among the association types PopNet provided ( + People , + Organizations , + Locations , + Objects , + Actions ) , people ( 3 ; P4 , P9 and P10 ) , objects ( 3 ; P2 , P8 and P9 ) and actions ( 3 ; P1 , P3 and P5 ) are most preferred by users , as users can quickly recall plots and enriched the ideation in their mind by browsing these types . Locations ( 2 ; P2 and P3 ) and organizations ( 1 ; P6 ) were also mentioned by several users as their mostly used association types , since iconic locations or organizations were good cues to set on a specific scene . Finally , though not used as much compared to overview and association pages , users pointed out that search bar was useful because 1 ) when they already have some specific thing in their mind and would like to check more details , search bar provided them with a short cut to the entity / action page , saving them lots of time ; 2 ) when they were stuck with only browsing , they can try some non - domain - specific keywords and utilize the semantic search to associate with scenes in the pop culture domain ( e . g . , car = > drive , wash = > laundry ) . Due to the limitation of our data source , sometimes the search function did not return meaningful matching results for users’ free input of keywords . We leave this for future work . 6 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONS 6 . 1 Supporting Other Pop Culture Domains During the development of PopNet , we focused only on movies and television series . However , pop culture encompasses many more things - music , toys , politics , sports , technology , etc . Our method of constructing the knowledge association network currently relies on plot summaries , which only exist for scripted entertainment . A potential way of extending this approach to other forms of pop culture is to find a place where these things are discussed and try to use the same 9 , , Wang and Chilton technique . Newspapers cover politics , sports , music , and other consumer goods and thus starting with news articles could a promising approach . Another avenue would be to look at online discussions like Reddit threads . A complication with social media is that discussions do not always stay on topic , and it does not have a consistent level of detail that plot summaries do . Journalism is is more consistent , but there is not nearly as much of it . In addition to extracting knowledge and associations about pop culture , it might also be useful to extract similar information on the brands and messages people want to convey in PopRef images . Although our users had little difficulty understanding brands like Oreo and BMW they could have overlooked potential connections . Some structured information about brands ( taglines , products , etc ) do exist in Google Knowledge Graph , but that omits lots of associations people have with the products . For example , that kids like to twist Oreos open , or that BMW drivers don’t know how to use their blinkers . Automatically extracting associations for brands , products , and other entities is an open challenge that could greatly enhance creative connections for PopRefs and beyond . 6 . 2 Supporting Connections in Creative Tasks As discussed in the Related Work , many creative tasks rely on connections . Much research has focused on supporting divergent thinking like brainstorming , but more effort is needed to focus on support convergent thinking to put together the pieces that get brainstormed . The combination of structured information and associations is a powerful enhancement to our own cognitive abilities , and knowledge association networks are one way to capture that . In PopNet , we created a stand - alone interface for a one - off task . However , what would be much more powerful is to integrate the knowledge association network into environments where people are already doing work . For example , it could be useful to embed PopNet as a sidebar in Google Presentations to help people add pop references to their slides . More generally , it would be useful to help people integrate knowledge association graphs into their email inboxes . When composing emails , they can piece together bits of information from previous emails they have written that include structured information like peoples names and email , or unstructured associative information such as boilerplate text you copy to all students who want their grade raised . Sentence - level autocomplete [ 9 ] is a step towards this , but by reusing one’s existing emails we could enable more useful and personal suggestions . 6 . 3 Improving PopNet This system has several limitations that we plan to work on in the future . First , as an initial step to build pop culture domain - specific network , we choose wiki plot sections as our data source , which is generalizable and informative , but also has limitations . For example , wiki plots missed famous quotes such as “May the Force be with you " from Star Wars and “Joey never shares food " from Friends , as well as iconic objects that never shows in a specific plot , like yellow scrolling text from Star Wars and door frame from Friends . As the next step , we will consider integrating other data sources , like social media discussion into the system as the supplementation . Second , we only extracted subject - verb - object relations by finding ARG0 - V - ARG1 tagging from open information extraction . We thus missed part of relations for entities if they belong to other kinds of arguments . In the future work , dependency parsing could be done to simplify the sentences further and capture more of the relations . Third , we utilized several AI models to do the automated processing , which have high performance but also bring errors . For example , open information extraction model will recognize “Eddie " , which is definitely a character’s name , as the predicate . This may bring some surprisingly meaningless results to PopNet system . We shall find approaches to reducing these mistakes , such as adding another step to filter out non - verbs from the extracted predicates . 10 PopNet : a Pop Culture Knowledge Association Network for Supporting Creative Connections , , Fourth , as several participants suggested during the interview , we could improve image qualities of entries , especially for actions . We will consider using short cut videos to replace images for actions , so that users could recall the scene more vividly . We can also support searching adjective plus entity in the system , such as “Fat Monica " , by adding more source data for semantic search . Lastly , we have only tested the automatic construction on 5 pop culture domains : Star Wars , Harry Potter , Game of Thrones , Friends , and Breaking Bad . More thorough testing of other movies and TV shows is required to know how general the pipeline is . 7 CONCLUSION This paper presents PopNet , a pop culture knowledge association network to support creative connections . We used state - of - the - art NLP techniques to automatically build the network from plain text . We also built an interface that allowed users to interact with the network and support their divergent and convergent thinking . A 10 - participant user study showed that , compared to Google , users had better performance and felt more engaged in the creative connection tasks . We also provide insights into supporting connection findings in other kinds of creative tasks . REFERENCES [ 1 ] Bilal Abu - Salih . 2021 . Domain - specific knowledge graphs : A survey .
