METHODS Assessment of oxidative burst in avian whole blood samples : validation and application of a chemiluminescence method based on Pholasin Elin Sild & Peeter Hõrak Received : 11 June 2010 / Revised : 20 September 2010 / Accepted : 4 October 2010 / Published online : 17 October 2010 # Springer - Verlag 2010 Abstract Immunoecology deals with the questions about how immune defences have evolved and are being used and optimized in different environments , ecological settings and lineages . In such research , often only single time point measures and small sample volumes are available , which limits the applicability of traditional immunological meth - ods . Methodological progress in the field thus largely depends on the development and validation of immune assays suitable for ecological studies . Here we validate and apply a novel , Pholasin - based chemiluminescence method for assessment of oxidative burst in the whole blood samples of birds . This assay measures an inducible component of innate immunity by quantifying the immedi - ate extracellular oxidative burst of stimulated phagocytes . The assay procedure is simple , measurement precision is satisfactory and the measurement time is only 6 min . It can be performed on 20 μ L ( or smaller ) blood samples that can be preserved for a few days . Blood of six studied passerine species produced chemiluminescence response to stimula - tion with bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) in vitro . The magnitude of the response depended on the concentration and origin of the LPS . Parameters of this response depended on biological factors such as age of birds and in vivo priming with different antigens such LPS and Brucella abortus antigen suspension . Different parameters of the chemiluminescence response were significantly repeatable over 6 - day period . All these properties argue for a great potential applicability of this method in immunoecological research . Keywords Avian innate immunity . Chemiluminescence . Oxidative burst . Passerine birds .

Pholasin Introduction Immunoecology is a nascent discipline , viewing immune function in the context of ecology and adaptation ( Sheldon and Verhulst 1996 ; Schulenburg et al . 2009 ) that asks how immune defences have evolved and are being used and optimized in different environments , ecological settings and lineages . The basic link between immunology and evolution - ary ecology stems from the costs of immunity — energetic , developmental , immunopathological etc . ( Klasing et al . 1999 ; Klasing 2004 ; Sadd and Schmid - Hempel 2009 ) . If immune responses require resources that could be potentially allocat - ed to life - history traits such as growth and reproduction or sexual display , emergence of trade - offs between immune function and other components of fitness is inevitable ( Sheldon and Verhulst 1996 ; Lochmiller and Deerenberg 2000 ; Norris and Evans 2000 ) . Assessment of the costs related to immune function has remained a major problem for field biologists ( Klasing 2004 ; Lee 2006 ; Sadd and Schmid - Hempel 2009 ) , not least due to specific limitations inherent to ecological research . Such limitations include species specificity of many assays , requirements of non - lethality and often availability of only single time point measures and small sample volumes ( Matson et al . 2005 ; Millet et al . 2007 ) .

The aim of this paper is to validate and apply a novel , Pholasin - based chemiluminescence method for assessment of oxidative burst in the whole blood samples of birds . Oxidative burst ( also named respiratory burst ) is a main effector mechanism of microbial killing by phagocytic cells . These cells destroy microbial organisms by producing reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , a process that is mediated by the enzyme NADPH oxidase ( Freitas et al . 2009a ) . The primary product of this oxidase system is superoxide anion ( O 2 − ) which interacts with other molecules to generate more noxious reactive species such as peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radicals and hypochlorous acid . These compounds exhibit a broad spectrum of biotoxicity and thus form a critical component of innate immunity , serving as the first line of defence against microbial infection . In avian blood , the most numerous phagocytic cells are heterophils , and several studies have demonstrated that their oxidative burst is crucial for innate immune protection against different microbes ( reviewed by He et al . 2007 ) . On the other hand , prolonged production of high levels of ROS , as in chronic inflamma - tions , can cause intense oxidative stress , leading to accumu - lation of oxidative damage in tissues ( e . g . Kielland et al . 2009 ) . The latter aspect is of particular interest in the context of recent focus of evolutionary ecologists on the role of oxidative stress in mediating life - history trade - offs ( e . g . Monaghan et al . 2009 ; McGraw et al . 2010 ) . Research on ROS production by avian leukocytes has been predominantly performed on separated heterophils ( He et al . 2007 ) or macrophages ( Chadfield and Olsen 2001 ) . Due to limitations of the available amount of blood , such assays cannot be applied to typical study objects of ecologists such as passerine birds and small reptiles and mammals . The whole blood chemiluminescence ( WBCL ) assays are more suitable for such purposes because of the minimal sample volume required ( 2 – 20 μ L ) . Another key advantage is that the circulating phagocyte status can be evaluated with minimal manipulation of the blood since no isolation of cells is required . The functional state of whole blood phagocytes may reflect the physiological state of the host better than that of isolated leukocytes because isolation of cells can alter the viability , activity and receptor expression of cells ( Papp and Smits 2007 ) . To our knowledge , only four reports exist on the application of the WBCL response on avian blood ( reviewed by Papp et al . 2009 ) . These studies ( as well as studies on isolated cells ) have measured ROS production during 0 . 5 – 3 h after induction of oxidative burst where the luminescent signal is mainly generated by production of ROS during degran - ulation of heterophils . Here we apply a different method that measures the immediate , extracellular burst of stimu - lated phagocytes . ABEL® Cell Activation test kit uses Pholasin® , a photo - protein from a bioluminescent mollusc for enhancement of the chemiluminescent light signal that is produced when excited states of ROS , produced during the oxidative burst , relax to the ground state . Signal enhancement by Pholasin is 50 – 100 times more powerful than that of traditional optical probes such as luminol or cytochrome c . Also , the decay of the Pholasin chemiluminescent product is faster than that of the luminol product , which may represent an advantage of greater accuracy when establishing real - time kinetics of superoxide release ( reviewed by Freitas et al . 2009a ) . The Pholasin assay has been developed for assessment of oxidative burst in isolated human leukocytes or whole blood and , with an exception of a single study of fish ( Rider et al . 2009 ) , has been never applied for other taxa . The suitability of this assay for birds requires assessment and validation because avian phagocytic cells possess somewhat different bactericidal mechanisms than their mammalian counterparts ( Harmon 1998 ; Gerilechaogetu et al . 2009 ) . Our purpose here is to test for the suitability of Pholasin - based WBCL assay for measurement of stimulated oxida - tive burst in the avian blood . Because this assay offers different kind of information about oxidative burst than previously used methods , we expect that it would be potentially useful in poultry and veterinary research . Furthermore , the minute volumes of blood required and simplicity of the assay procedure should make this method especially appealing for applications in an emerging field of immunoecology . Specifically , we had the following goals : ( 1 ) to determine the optimal concentrations and types of in vitro stimulants of oxidative burst , ( 2 ) to assess the effects of storage time on the measurement precision of an assay , ( 3 ) to assess the natural sources of variation in WBCL response such as the age , sex and captivity , ( 4 ) to measure blood birdscaptured birds released LPS inoculation blood blood LPS and BA inoculation blood blood BA inoculation blood blood 67 3 4 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 29 30 36 37 44 45 51 52 53 65 66 68 MALES FEMALES birdscaptured Fig . 1 Course of the experi - ment .

Our main study objects were captive wild - caught green - finches ( Carduelis chloris ) , small ( 30 g ) passerine birds , which belong to the model species of immunoecological research . In addition , we test for the presence of WBCL response in five other passerine species and compare the patterns of response between birds and humans . The purpose of the latter is to test for the presence of taxon - specific differences of the oxidative burst . Recognizing such potential differences is important because avian biologists often rely on information obtained on mamma - lian species in interpreting their results regarding the function of phagocytes .

The birds were housed indoors in individual cages ( 27×51×55 cm ) with sand - covered floors . Average temperature in the aviary during the experiment was 12 . 7±1 . 9°C ( SD ) and average humidity was 48 . 0±8 . 6 % ( SD ) . The birds were supplied ad libitum with sunflower seeds and tap water . Birds were held on the natural day - length cycle on artificial lighting and released into their natural habitat in 11 March . Passerines from five other species ( house sparrow Passer domesticus , tree sparrow Passer montanus , great tit Parus major , blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus , hawfinch Coccothraustes cocco - thraustes ) were captured on 22 and 23 December 2010 and released immediately after blood sampling . Another subset of 11 greenfinces , for comparison with birds that had spent 2 months in captivity , was captured , immediately blood sampled and released on 5 March . The study was conducted under the license from the Estonian Ministry of the Environment , and the experiments comply with the current laws of Estonian Republic . Time course of the experiment is shown in the Fig . 1 . Twenty female captive greenfinches were blood sampled for adjustment of the assay procedures on 11 – 12 January and for collection of data for assessment of measurement precision and effects of immune activation treatments on 23 January and 23 February . Sixty male captive greenfinches were blood sampled on 27 January and on 2 and 8 February for determination of individual consistency of the param - eters of the WBCL response . A subset of males was also bled on 8 March for testing the effects of long - term captive conditions . As a part of a larger - scale experiment ( to be reported elsewhere ) , half of the males were inoculated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and all males with Brucella abortus antigen ( same doses as in females ; see below ) on 1 February . Blood sampling of captive birds took place in the morning before the lights turned on ( except during the initial adjustments of assay procedures ) . Other procedures , including maintenance and inoculations , were performed in the evenings after the lights had turned off . Blood was collected into 200 μ L Microvette® tubes ( K3E ) with EDTA tripotassium salt as an anticoagulant . Because blood clots remarkably reduce the luminescence signal ( see also Papp and Smits 2007 ) , special care was taken as to assure rapid blood flow and avoid coagulation . Tubes were shaken immediately after blood collection as to maximize the contact of blood with anticoagulant . Blood was maintained at room temperature until analysed during the same day , except when testing the effects of storage at 5°C ( see below ) . Blood from birds was collected from tarsal or brachial veins ; capillary blood from fingertips was collected from human volunteers . Leukocyte concentrations were determined from blood smears as described by Sarv and Hõrak ( 2009 ) and expressed as a number of leukocytes per 10 , 000 erythrocytes . Two immune system activation tests were performed with captive females . In the evening of 22 January , ten Table 1 Repeatabilities of parameters of WBCL response for two subsets of data , i . e . from the female greenfinches blood sampled on 23 January ( N = 20 ) and 23 February ( N = 19 ) Parameter r ( 23 January ) F df ( 23 January ) r ( 23 February ) F df ( 23 February ) Peak 1 0 . 64 6 . 14 19 , 38 0 . 66 5 . 38 18 , 25 Peak 2 0 . 47 3 . 59 19 , 38 0 . 66 5 . 50 18 , 25 Peak ratio 0 . 48 3 . 72 19 , 38 0 . 56 3 . 96 18 , 25 AUC 1 0 . 55 4 . 60 19 , 38 0 . 63 4 . 88 18 , 25 AUC 2 0 . 36 2 . 65 19 , 38 0 . 75 7 . 78 18 , 25 Sum AUC 0 . 43 3 . 20 19 , 38 0 . 72 6 . 85 18 , 25 Baseline 0 . 32 2 . 36 19 , 38 0 . 32 2 . 08 18 , 25 First subset included samples measured twice during 6 . 5 h after blood sampling and samples measured during 2 h after 32 h of maintenance in a refrigerator at 5°C . Each observation in the refrigerated subset was adjusted for the decline in parameter values by adding a constant calculated on the basis of data presented in Table 2 . The second subset consisted of samples measured in triplicate during 9 . 5 h after bleeding . In this set of observations , all parameter values ( except for baseline and peak ratio ) declined linearly with increasing time lag from bleeding to analysing ( Pearson r = − 0 . 50 to − 0 . 73 ) . Individual trait values were therefore adjusted for this decline by multiplication with regression slope with respect to time of sampling .

Ten control individuals received 40 μ L isotonic saline injections in the pectoralis muscle . Birds were blood sampled in the next morning for testing the effects of LPS inoculation on the parameters of the WBCL response . In the evening of 16 February , ten birds were inoculated with 40 μ L of B . abortus suspension in the pectoralis muscle ( serum agglutination test antigen , Strain 99 , product code RAA0054 , Veterinary Laboratories Agen - cy , Weybridge , UK ) . Ten control individuals received the same amount of saline . Birds were blood sampled in the morning of 23 February for testing the effects of B . abortus in the period of antibody production on the parameters of WBCL response . For assessment of measurement precision , we calculated repeatabilities according to Lessells and Boag ( 1987 ) . Effects of experimental treatments were assessed by T tests and factorial ANCOVAs . Assumptions for parametric models ( normality of residuals , homogeneity of variances ) were met for all the variables except leukocyte counts ; hence , non - parametric tests were used in analyses with leukocyte data . All tests are two - tailed with an α - level below 0 . 05 as a criterion for significance . Assay principle Oxidative burst in the whole blood samples was measured using ABEL® Cell Activation test kit with Pholasin® and Adjuvant - K ™ ( Knight Scientific , Ply - mouth , UK ) . Pholasin is a 34 - kD photoprotein from the bioluminescent mollusc Pholas dactylus that emits light in the presence of reactive molecules such as superoxide anion , singlet oxygen , hydroxyl and ferryl radicals , nitric oxide , hypochlorous and hypobromous acids , chlor - amines , bromamines , peroxynitrite and peroxidases . The assay was originally designed for human blood , and the originally recommended stimulants of oxidative burst are n - formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine ( fMLP ) , which binds to specific receptors and phorbol - 12 - myristate - 13 - acetate ( PMA ) , which activates NADPH oxidase indepen - dently of receptors and stimulates degranulation of phagocytic cells . Chicken heterophils lack the receptors for fMLP ( Kogut et al . 1998 ; Gerilechaogetu et al . 2009 ) ; we corroborated this finding for greenfinches , as the luminescence did not increase in response to fMLP . We therefore used bacterial LPS as a stimulant . Because molecules of Pholasin are too large to enter the cells and the increase in luminescence in response to LPS is very rapid ( Figs . 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 ) , the observed response reflects the production of extracellular reactive species . The radical detected by such stimulation was ( at least ) predominantly superoxide because incubation of the blood dilution with superoxide dismutase reduced the parameters of luminescence about 70 % ( Fig . 2 ) . Recep - tors and molecular processes involved in response of avian heterophils to bacterial LPS are reviewed by Farnell et al . ( 2003 ) .

First , 20 μ L of whole blood was diluted in 2 mL blood dilution buffer . Then 85 μ L of reconstitution and assay buffer , 20 μ L of reconstituted Adjuvant - K , 50 μ L of Pholasin and 20 μ L of diluted whole blood were added to an opaque white 96 - well microplate well . One well was measured at a time . Plate was incubated with medium shaking at 37°C for 1 min , thereafter recording of luminescence at every second started . Luminescence was recorded for 1 min to determine baseline levels . Subsequently 25 μ L of LPS solution was injected with automatic dispenser . Luminescence was recorded at every second for 2 min ; thereafter , another 25 - μ L dose of LPS was injected and luminescence recorded for further 2 min . Secondary injection of a stimulant after 2 min induced another rapid peak in luminescence , which was usually higher than the first peak . Assuming that the response to second injection might yield additional infor - mation about the ability of phagocytes to respond to stimulation , we set the double injection as a part of our standard protocol . We thus recorded seven different parameters during our main experiment : maximum lumi - nescence after the first and second LPS injection ( peak 1 and peak 2 ) , ratio of these peaks ( height of peak 2 / height of peak 1 ) , areas under curve , measured during 2 min after first and second LPS injections ( AUC 1 and AUC 2 , respectively ) , summed AUC ( i . e . AUC 1 + AUC 2 ) and average baseline luminescence measured during 1 min before the first LPS injection . Functionally , the heights of first and second peaks describe maximum capacity of phagocytes to produce ROS in response to stimulation . First peak characterises the capability of oxidative burst of unprimed cells while the second peak is indicative of the capability of oxidative burst of ( in vitro ) primed cells . Peak ratio thus indicates the extent of potentiation of phagocytes ( the higher the ratio , the higher the potentiation ) . Areas under curve characterise the total amount of ROS produced in response to stimulation in vitro . Because baseline signal was more than 200 times lower than that of the maximum , we did not adjust other measurements by subtraction of the baseline luminescence values . Luminescence is expressed in relative luminescence units . Analyses were performed with Biotek Synergy 2 microplate reader . We caution for careful and repeated priming of the injector system with a stimulant before running the reactions and discarding the clotted samples , as those give no reliable results . Optimisation and validation For induction of oxidative burst , we used different concen - trations of two types of LPS : E . coli LPS 055 : B5 ( Sigma L2880 ) and Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium ( Sigma L6511 ) . LPS from E . coli induced higher signals than that of S . enterica serotype typhimurium ( Fig . 3 ) , and effects of both stimulants were dose dependent ( Fig . 4 ) . In the case of S . enterica serotype typhimurium LPS , we established that this dose dependence was non - linear ( Fig . 4b ) . For the standard analyses , we chose the E . coli LPS in concentration of 1 mg / mL because it gave very strong ( over 200 times ) increase in luminescence .

All bird species and humans responded to stimulation . Notably , a response in human blood to first injection was about 45 times weaker than that of greenfinches ; however , the second response was in a comparable magnitude to that of birds ( Fig . 5 ) . Storage time and measurement precision The time lag from blood collection to sample analysis affected the studied parameters in female greenfinches in one sampling bout ( 23 February ) but not in another one ( 23 January ) . On 23 February , there was a linear decline with time for all measured variables ( Pearson r = − 0 . 50 to − 0 . 73 ) except for baseline luminescence and peak ratio . This interference could be , however , easily removed by adjust - ment of individual data values to the regression slope . Table 1 ( fourth column ) indicates that repeatabilities calculated after such adjustment were reasonably high . In a case of larger sample ( n = 60 ) of male birds measured during 7 h after bleeding , also all parameter values ( except baseline luminescence , which increased ) declined with in - creasing time lag from bleeding to analysing ( Pearson r = − 0 . 26 to − 0 . 63 ) . The individual values of that time lag were thus kept as covariates in all calculations . Storage of samples at 5°C for 32 h resulted in slight decline of all parameter values except for baseline luminescence and peak ratio ( Table 2 ) . This interference could be again conveniently handled because adjustment for the decline gave reasonably high repeatabilities for most of the parameters ( second column in Table 1 ) . Results LPS treatment Female greenfinches inoculated with LPS in the previous evening ( 20 h prior to blood sampling ) displayed higher WBCL response than saline - treated controls ( Table 3 ) . In particular , LPS - inoculated birds had higher peak response to secondary in vitro LPS injection and higher total ROS production ( larger areas under curve ) . Interestingly , the height of the first peak depended on the interaction between age and LPS treatment : In yearlings , treatment increased the lumines - cence response while older birds were not affected ( Fig . 6 ; significant Age×Treatment interaction ( F 1 , 16 = 7 . 4 , P = 0 . 015 ) in a model containing the effects of Age ( F 1 , 16 = 6 . 8 , P = 0 . 019 ) and Treatment ( F 1 , 16 = 3 . 3 , P = 0 . 089 ) ) . Independently of LPS treatment , older birds had 17 % higher peak ratio than yearlings ( 1 . 73±0 . 30 vs . 1 . 43±0 . 14 t 11 , 8 = 2 . 66 , P = 0 . 016 ) . Other parameters of ROS production were independent of age in models adjusting for the LPS inoculation ( P = 0 . 21 – 0 . 98 ) . LPS inoculation did not affect the concentra - tion of the leukocytes ( P = 0 . 28 – 0 . 49 ) . Several parameters of WBCL response correlated negatively with leukocyte counts ( Table 4 ) . B . abortus treatment Female greenfinches inoculated with B . abortus suspension and blood sampled 7 days later on 23 February had significantly higher WBCL response to secondary LPS injection in vitro than saline - treated controls . B . abortus - inoculated birds had higher second peak ( Fig . 7 ) and second and summed AUC and higher peak ratio than saline - treated control birds . In case of first AUC , there was also a non - significantly higher ROS production in B . abortus - inoculated birds ( Table 5 ) . The age effect was significant for all parameters except baseline luminescence and peak ratio ; older birds had generally 12 % to 23 % higher WBCL response than yearlings ( Table 6 ; Fig . 7 ) . Birds inoculated with B . abortus had significantly higher ( P = 0 . 002 , z = 3 . 03 ) concentration of circulating heterophils ( 8 . 4±3 . 5 , n = 8 ) than saline - treated control birds ( 2 . 3±2 . 2 , n = 9 ) . B . abortus - inoculated birds had also significantly more ( P = 0 . 039 , z = 2 . 07 ) lymphocytes in the peripheral blood ( 6 . 8±7 . 5 , n = 8 ) than control birds ( 2 . 3±3 . 0 , n = 9 ) .

Repeatability in time All parameters of WBCL of male greenfinches showed significant individual consistency when measured over 6 - day period between 27 January and 2 February ( Table 8 ) . Most repeatable trait was peak ratio which had the highest slope ( β = 0 . 54 ) and highest proportion of variance explained by previous measurement ( η 2 = 31 ) . Interestingly , this individual consistency was lost when we compared repeatabilities during the next 6 - day period between 2 and 8 February ( all P values > 0 . 12 ) . Comparison of captive and wild birds Five female and six male wild greenfinches , measured at capture on 5 March , did not differ with respect to any parameters of luminescence ( all P values > 0 . 21 ) . We therefore pooled the data of wild birds over both sexes for comparison with captive males , sampled on 8 March . Wild birds had significantly higher induced WBCL response and higher baseline levels than males who had spent 2 months in captivity ( Table 9 ) . The only exception was peak ratio , which was similar in wild and captive birds . Difference was the biggest in baseline luminescence , which was 45 % higher in wild birds . Discussion WBCL responses induced by injection of bacterial LPS into avian whole blood samples were rapid , and the magnitude of increase of luminescence signal was more than 200 times over baseline at high concentrations of the stimulant . To our knowledge , this strong increase in luminescence signal has been never obtained by using traditional optical probes such as luminol , lucigenin , cytochrome c or dihydrorhodamine 123 ( Farnell et al . 2003 ; Papp and Smits 2007 ; Freitas et al . 2009b ) . Avian WBCL responses to LPS were also remarkably higher than human whole blood responses to stimulation by fMLP and PMA ( five to 20 times increase in signal strength as indicated in the kit manual ) . One possible reason for obtaining such unusually strong increase in signal strength is the use of very high concentration of bacterial LPS ( 1 mg / mL ) in our standard assay . Final LPS concentrations from 10 to 50 μ g / mL have been applied in a study of chicken heterophils ( Farnell et al . 2003 ) . Such concentrations of LPS yielded very low ( less than two times ) increase of signal in response to stimulant in our study ( Fig . 4 ) . Magnitude of WBCL response after second injection of LPS in humans was identical to that of a greenfinch T a b l e 6 S i m u lt a n e ou s e ff ec t s o f a g e ( y ea r li ng v s . o l d e r ) a nd B . abo r t u s v s . s a li n e t r ea t m e n t on p a r a m e t e r s o f W B C L r e s pon s e i n ANOVA E ff ec t B a s e li n e P ea k 1 P ea k 2 P ea k r a ti o AU C 1 AU C 2 S u m AU C F d f P F d f P F d f P F d f P F d f P F d f P F d f P A g e 1 . 6 1 , 16 0 . 2 4 . 7 1 , 16 0 . 046 18 . 8 1 , 16 0 . 0005 2 . 2 1 , 16 0 . 2 9 . 5 1 , 16 0 . 007 11 . 0 1 , 16 0 . 004 13 . 8 1 , 16 0 . 002 B . abo r t u s 0 . 0 1 , 16 1 . 0 0 . 6 1 , 16 0 . 4 18 . 7 1 , 16 0 . 0005 7 . 3 1 , 16 0 . 022 3 . 6 1 , 16 0 . 074 8 . 6 1 , 16 0 . 009 8 . 6 1 , 16 0 . 097 A ll i n t e r ac ti on s b e t w ee n f ac t o r s w e r e non - s i gn i f i ca n t .

Note , however , that only primed human blood was capable for such a strong response as the response to primary LPS injection was 45 times lower than that of greenfinches ( Fig . 5 ) . Avian heterophils differ from mam - malian neutrophils , e . g . with respect to mitogen - activated protein cascades ( Gerilechaogetu et al . 2009 ) and perhaps most notably by the lack of myeloperoxidase and catalase ( Harmon 1998 ) . Currently , we have no explanation about why human blood requires priming for production of the strong WBCL response while the avian blood does not , but the differences of phagocyte functioning between these two taxa are clearly evident on the basis of our results . In any case , our finding that unprimed avian blood is capable for much more higher oxidative burst in response to stimula - tion with LPS than human blood clearly controverts the contention of Harmon ( Harmon 1998 ) that avian hetero - phils depend primarily on non - oxidative microbicidal mechanisms . Measurement precision of the Pholasin assay was estimated on the basis of intraclass correlation coefficients , i . e . repeatability ( Lessells and Boag 1987 ) . This method has an advantage over intra - and inter - assay coefficients of variation because it accounts for measurement precision in the biological context , i . e . with respect to between - individual variation . Repeatabilities of all parameters of the WBCL response were significant but not particularly high for some parameters such as baseline luminescence ( Table 1 ) . However , particularly in the second dataset , the repeatabilities for most of parameters exceeded 0 . 6 . Such measurement precision was evidently robust enough as to enable detection of the effects of immune activation treatments despite small sample sizes . Note , however , that the repeatability values in Table 1 were obtained after adjustment of data values for the time lag between blood sampling and analysing . Recording such time lags is thus mandatory in the case of this assay , and whenever possible , we recommend duplicate or triplicate measurement of each blood sample . Especially triplicate measuring would enable to exclude aberrant results , which to our experience are most likely to emerge from clotted blood samples and insufficient priming of the injector system with a stimulant . Strength of the luminescence signal decayed with time of storage in refrigerator ( Table 2 ) ; however , this interference could be also removed statistically . The possibility to store blood samples for a few days at 5°C means that this assay can be applied for the samples collected in the field ; however , the possible effects of storage time on the decrease in WBCL parameters must be carefully monitored . To induce oxidative burst , we used LPS from two different bacterial strains . Both E . coli strain 055 : B5 and S . enterica serotype typhimurium are widely used in immu - nological and immunoecological studies of birds , usually in purpose of inducing acute phase response ( e . g .

N = 17 Behav Ecol Sociobiol ( 2010 ) 64 : 2065 – 2076 2073 al . 2006 ) or testing for the microbicidal ability of blood ( e . g . Millet et al . 2007 ) . In our study , the WBCL response induced by E . coli strain 055 : B5 was more than six times higher than that induced by S . enterica serotype typhimu - rium ( Fig . 3 ) . One possible explanation would be different purity of our LPS strains , as it has been shown that contaminating endotoxin proteins rather than pure LPS can be responsible for the Toll - like receptor signalling ( Hirschfeld et al 2000 ) . Alternatively , the differential responses to LPS from different bacterial strains may reflect evolutionary adaptations to interaction with different microbial species . This could be evaluated by measuring WBCL response to LPS of different microbial species and strains in comparative studies of bird species with different ecology . Besides the species - specific differences , the effects of LPS on WBCL were non - linearly dose dependent . Similar pattern has been also observed in studies with chicken heterophils ( Farnell et al . 2003 ) . We recorded seven different parameters of the WBCL response in order to find out whether all of them provide comparable information about the functioning of the phagocytes . This was not the case , as the first response to LPS injection was affected by different factors than the WBCL response to second LPS injection . In particular , there was clear effect of immune challenge with either LPS or B . abortus on the secondary response , i . e . 2 min after the priming of the blood sample with first injection of LPS . B . abortus treatment did not affect the primary LPS response ( Table 4 ) , and LPS increased the primary response only among yearling birds . This indicates that primary and secondary WBCL responses convey different information about the ability of phagocytes to generate oxidative burst . In general , the secondary response was higher than the primary one ( Tables 3 and 5 ) which indicates that phagocytic cells in the blood can be primed to produce more ROS shortly after the first encounter with a stimulant . The relative magnitude of this priming effect is captured by the parameter peak ratio ( maximum of the secondary response / maximum of the primary response ) . Interestingly , this parameter showed highest individual consistency over the 6 - day period ( Table 7 ) and also correlated most strongly with concentrations of heterophils and lymphocytes after B . abortus inoculation ( Table 6 ) . We are not aware that such a ‘ potentiation ability ’ of phagocytes has been studied before in birds , but our study suggests that this variable may capture biologically interesting information . In humans , massive ROS release by primed neutrophils is believed to contribute to tissue injury in inflammatory diseases , and patients with severe sepsis have been shown to have primed population of neutrophils ( El - Benna et al . 2008 ) . In the present study , priming of the WBCL response was also obtained by in vivo inoculation of immunostimulants LPS and B . abortus . Effect of E . coli LPS is perhaps expected , given the pyrogenic nature of this compound . It has also been shown that priming of chickens with Salmonella enteritidis immune lymphokines in vivo in - duced more efficient killing of S . enterica serotype typhimurium , Salmonella gallinarum and E . coli ( Kogut et al . 1995 ) . The finding that also B . abortus inoculation primed the WBCL response is novel , and it is noteworthy that this priming could be detected 7 days after B . abortus administration . B . abortus is frequently used for induction and measurement of humoral immune response in avian studies ( see Amat et al . 2006 ) . B . abortus antigen can induce oxidative burst in human neutrophils in vitro ( Zwerdling et al . 2009 ) ; here we showed for the first time that B . abortus is capable of a long - term potentiation of phagocytic cells in birds . This finding confirms that B . abortus is a suitable antigen for assessment of the potential long - term costs of immune activation ( see also Ottenweller et al . 1998 ) . B . abortus also delayed apoptosis of human neutrophils ( Zwerdling et al . 2009 ) ; it is possible that such an effect was partly responsible for higher heterophil hemoconcentration in B . abortus - inoculated birds in this study . The magnitude of WBCL response is expected to depend on the concentration of phagocytic cells in the blood . Such relationship was previously described by Papp and Smits ( 2007 ) in frogs , chickens and bears . In this study , only second AUC correlated significantly and positively with the hemoconcentration of heterophils after B . abortus inocula - tion ( Table 7 ) .

This indicates that the WBCL response , measured in the Pholasin assay , depends more on the functioning of phagocytic cells than their number in the blood . This result would be compatible with the findings that marked heterophilia is not necessary protective against infection ( Campbell and Ellis 2007 ) and that in some cases peripheral heterophilia may co - occur with suppression of the functional activity of heterophils ( Kogut et al . 1999 ) . For a biologist aiming to understand the causes and consequences of variation in physiological traits , repeat - ability in time is an important parameter . With respect to the individual consistency of the parameters of WBCL response , our study produced contradictory results . In the period between 27 January and 2 February , all measured parameters of males were significantly repeatable ( Table 8 ) ; however , none of the parameters was repeatable during the next 6 - day period . In any case , our results show that at least under some circumstances individuals can consistently differ in their ability to produce WBCL response . One source of such between - individual differ - ences was the age of birds . Here the results were again somewhat contradictory in different measurements . LPS inoculation in vivo increased the primary response only among the yearlings ( Fig . 6 ) . However , 1 month later , older birds had ( independent of B . abortus treatment ) generally higher primary and secondary WBCL responses than yearlings ( Fig . 7 ; Table 6 ) . Captivity is known to affect several physiological parameters of wild birds ( reviewed by Sepp et al . 2010 ) . Wild greenfinches displayed significantly higher WBCL response than their conspecifics that had spent 2 months in captivity ( Table 9 ) . This result may have multiple explan - ations such as differences in microclimate , diet , perceived predation risk or stress levels which all could potentially affect immune responsiveness . Conversely , another study in greenfinches found that plasma concentrations of nitric oxide metabolites ( another indicator of innate immune activity ) were higher in captive than in wild greenfinches ( Sild and Hõrak 2009 ) . However , the birds in that comparison had spent only 26 days in captivity , which could partly explain the difference between these two studies . Furthermore , one should perhaps not expect that all components of innate immunity respond similarly to environmental effects . In conclusion , we have shown that a Pholasin - based assay for assessment of WBCL response is suitable for application in birds . We predict that it would be specifically useful in comparative immunoecological research ( Hasselquist 2007 ) , but also in answering questions about how dietary antioxidants ( e . g . Walrand et al . 2005 ; Olsson et al . 2009 ) and other compounds ( e . g . McReynolds et al . 2009 ) or manipulation of physical activity and infection affect ROS production during innate immune responses . Equally interesting would be to test whether individuals with higher WBCL response appear more resistant to experi - mental infections or more susceptible to oxidative stress . Furthermore , we believe that this method should be easily adjustable for immunoecological research in a wide range of taxa including mammals , reptiles , amphibians , fish and insects .
