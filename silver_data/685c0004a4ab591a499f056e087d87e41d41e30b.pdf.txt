Moreover , recent molecular genetics studies implicate ErbB4 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . However , the phenotypic consequences of haploinsufficiency of ErbB4 are not known , as no coding mutations have been identified until now . Here , we present a patient with early myoclonic encephalopathy and profound psychomotor delay with a de novo reciprocal translocation t ( 2 ; 6 ) ( q34 ; p25 . 3 ) , disrupting the ErbB4 gene . This patient represents the first case of haploinsufficiency for one of the ErbB family members of tyrosine kinase receptors .

Prognosis is generally poor with early death in half of the patients . The other half usually develops a therapy - resistant epilepsy with numerous mainly myo - clonic seizures and developmental arrest . 1 In most cases , the etiology is unknown and rare familial cases have been described . 2 ErbB4 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) family of tyrosine kinase receptors that regulate cell growth , proliferation and differentiation . This family comprises four members that share structural and functional similarities ( EGFR , ErbB2 - 4 ) , and interact with a variety of ligands and with each other . 3 ErbB4 spans 1 . 15Mb on chromosome 2q34 and has four different isoforms because of alternative splicing . 4 ErbB4 is widely expressed in many adult and fetal tissues , with high expression in developing brain and heart . 5 Targeted inactivation of ErbB4 in a mouse results in midembryonic lethality because of failed myocardium development . 6 Rescued ErbB4 mutant mice reach adulthood but display mammary gland defects , aberrant cranial nerve connec - tions and increased cerebellar interneurons . 7 One of the most important and well - studied ligands of ErbB4 is neuregulin - 1 ( NRG1 ) , and it was shown that NRG1 – ErbB4 signaling is essential for neurobiological processes , such as neurogenesis , migration , synaptic plasticity and differen - tiation of neurons and glia . 8 After the identification of NRG1 as a candidate for schizophrenia , different schizo - phrenia - associated SNPs in ErbB4 were also identified . 9 However , in humans , the phenotypic consequences of haploinsufficiency of ErbB4 are not known , as no coding mutations or deletions have been identified until now . Here , we present a patient with epileptic encephalopathy and profound psychomotor delay with a de novo transloca - tion t ( 2 ; 6 ) ( q34 ; p25 . 3 ) , disrupting the ErbB4 gene . This patient represents the first case of haploinsufficiency for one of the ErbB family members of tyrosine kinase receptors .

Family history is negative . Because of poor sucking , she was hospitalized at day 11 , when a unilateral multicystic kidney and tubular acidosis type 4 were diagnosed . During hospitalization , seizures were noted for the first time and initially fenobarbital was administrated . These seizures were reported as typical ‘erratic myoclonic seizures’ . In addition , she had two generalized tonic – clonic convulsions during fever . The first EEG performed at day 15 was reported normal . However , in the following days and weeks , the EEG’s changed , showing a pattern of suppression bursts initially more accentuating during sleep , but later also during wakefulness . Despite treatment , the frequency of seizures increased dramatically during the following months , necessitating frequent hospitalizations and additive therapy consisting of valproic acid and topiramate . Her development was severely delayed with pronounced hypotonia , absent eye contact , limited spon - taneous movements , no speech development and progres - sive microcephaly . The therapy - resistant seizures led to her being admitted , at the age of 18 months , to an epilepsy center for children . On the basis of the patient’s history , clinical observation and EEG registration , she was diag - nosed with symptomatic early myoclonic encephalopathy . EEG at that time revealed a hypsarrhythmic pattern during wakefulness with periods of suppression - burst pattern during sleep ( Figure 1 ) . As expected with this diagnosis , there was almost no progress in psychomotor development and she persisted in having multiple erratic myoclonic seizures . Tonic seizures were not seen , and generalized myoclonic seizures were rare . Additional investigations , including a metabolic work - up and skin biopsy , were normal . MRI of the brain showed moderate cortical and subcortical atrophy . Chromosome analysis revealed a de novo reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 2q and 6p , t ( 2 ; 6 ) ( q33 . 1 ; p23 ) . Re - evaluation at the age of 4 years and 10 months shows a profoundly retarded girl showing no contact with her environment and acting at a developmental level of 4 months ( Figure 2 ) . She is microcephalic , unable to sit , with pronounced axial hypotonia and peripheral hypertonia with brisk tendon reflexes . She still has frequent daily fits of the myoclonic type , therapy resistant , compatible with early myoclonic encephalopathy . Materials and methods The protocol was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital of Leuven , Belgium , and informed consent was obtained from the parents of the affected patient .

ErbB4 disruption causes myoclonic encephalopathy L Backx et al 379 European Journal of Human Genetics Chromosome and array comparative genome hybridization ( CGH ) analysis Karyotyping was performed according to routine protocol . Arrays used in this study were constructed for total genome coverage using a 1Mb clone set . Clone prepara - tion , hybridization and data analysis were performed as described previously . 10 Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) was used to confirm results of array CGH as well as for mapping the breakpoints . Mutation analysis of the ErbB4 and GDP - mannose 4 , 6 - dehydratase ( GMDS ) genes Primers were designed to amplify all coding exons and intron – exon boundaries of the ErbB4 and GMDS genes . Sequences are available on request . Amplification , sequen - cing and analyses were performed according to routine protocol . Results Routine karyotyping revealed a t ( 2 ; 6 ) ( q33 . 1 ; p23 ) in the patient ( Figure 3 ) . Karyotypes of both parents were normal . Because apparently balanced translocations can be more complex , genomic DNA of the patient was analyzed on 1Mb array . Besides a known copy number variation , no other imbalances were detected . Subsequent FISH analysis demonstrated that the breakpoint on chromosome 2 is located in clone RP11 - 694B12 that shows a split signal in 2q34 and maps within the first intron of ErbB4 . Therefore , the breakpoint is located between coding exons 1 and 2 , disrupting the ErbB4 gene ( Figure 3 ) . Gene expression analysis was not performed because ErbB4 is not suffi - ciently expressed in Epstein – Barr transformed lympho - blastic cell lines ( EBV - LCL ) . The breakpoint on chromosome 6p25 . 3 is located in the overlapping ends of clones RP11 - 323F15 and RP11 - 707D01 , disrupting the GMDS gene ( Figure 3 ) . Quantitative RT - PCR of GMDS mRNA levels in EBV - LCL of the patient showed 50 % reduction in comparison with normal controls ( data not shown ) . The corrected karyotype based on these data is t ( 2 ; 6 ) ( q34 ; p25 . 3 ) . The disrupted genes are orientated in opposite directions , making it unlikely that a fusion transcript is generated . Subsequent mutation analysis showed no mutations in the normal ErbB4 and GMDS alleles . Discussion We present a patient with severe epileptic encephalopathy , diagnosed as early myoclonic encephalopathy , carrying a de novo reciprocal translocation disrupting the GMDS and ErbB4 genes . The GMDS gene plays a role in the conversion of GDP - mannose to GDP - fucose . Deficiencies in the biosynthesis of GDP - fucose lead to leukocyte adhesion deficiency type II ( LADII ) , which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent infections , persistent leuko - cytosis and severe mental and growth retardation ( MIM 266265 ) . Although it was first assumed that deficient GDP - fucose biosynthesis would cause LADII , Luhn et al 11 showed that LADII is caused by a defect in a specific transporter of GDP - fucose into the Golgi . Thus far , the GMDS gene has not been associated to a specific disease , although one can assume that this disease would resemble LADII and be recessive in inheritance . Hence , we sequenced the other GMDS allele , but did not detect a mutation . Moreover , recurrent infections , immune defi - ciency , growth retardation and persistent leukocytosis are absent in our patient . Disruption of GMDS , therefore , most likely has no phenotypic effect , and the phenotype in the patient can be attributed to the disruption of ErbB4 . Given the absence of mutation on the second ErbB4 allele , haploinsufficiency is the proposed pathogenic mechanism . The position of the breakpoint within the gene , as well as the absence of alternative splice forms starting downstream from the breakpoint , predicts a loss of function . HER4 / ErbB4 is a member of the type I receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily and serves as a receptor for the NRG family of growth factors . At the cellular level , ErbB4 is expressed by somatodendrites in cerebral cortex and hippocampus from birth to adulthood . 12 The importance of this receptor during development is further demon - strated by the generation of knockout mice . These mice die during midembryogenesis because of failed development of the myocardium . 6 Mice heterozygous for the inactivated ErbB4 allele displayed no obvious defects in contrast to our finding in the patient . 6 , 13 However , in a more recent study , Golub et al 14 found that heterozygous nulls do display subtle neurological defects , such as delayed motor Figure 2 Clinical pictures of the patient at age 18 months ( left ) , and 4 years and 10 months ( right ) . ErbB4 disruption causes myoclonic encephalopathy L Backx et al 380 European Journal of Human Genetics development and altered cue use in a Morris maze learning and memory task . Interestingly , high ErbB4 expression was shown in precursors of interneurons migrating from the medial ganglionic eminence to the developing cortex . 15 A crucial role in interneuron migration and differentiation is further corroborated by an elegant study done by Flames et al . 16 They showed that NRG - 1 / ErbB4 interaction is necessary for short / long range attraction of tangentially migrating interneurons at different stages of their journey . ErbB4 - expressing interneurons migrate to the cortex through a corridor where there is expression of NRG - 1 , which constitutes the attractant for the migration . Loss of ErbB4 and / or NRG - 1 function perturbs interneuron migration and alters the number of GABA - ergic inter - neurons in postnatal cortex . 16 These findings might explain the occurrence of severe epileptic encephalopathy in our patient beacuse of a reduced number or function of cortical GABA - ergic interneurons . Defects in interneuron migration and function have already been associated with epilepsy in humans , as is the case for ARX . 17 , 18 Mutations in ARX are responsible for X - linked infantile spasms ( ISSXs ) and more recently for early infantile epileptic encephalo - pathy ( EIEE ) or Ohtahara syndrome . 19 Another monogenic cause of early epileptic encephalopathy , almost exclusively restricted to female patients , are mutations in the X - linked CDKL5 gene 20 – 22 This gene was initially identified in female patients with the early seizure variant of Rett syndrome . 23 , 24 In this respect , it is interesting to mention that Pescucci et al 25 reported a girl , who was presented with severe epilepsy and Rett - like features carrying a deletion in 2q34 encompassing the ErbB4 gene . Although the ARX and CDKL5 - associated epilepsy pheno - types can be clearly differentiated from the present case , it would be interesting to analyze ErbB4 in a larger cohort Figure 3 Schematic representation of the translocation and the two breakpoints on 2q34 and 6p25 . 3 : ( a ) Partial karyotype of the patient showing the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 2q and 6p .

ErbB4 disruption causes myoclonic encephalopathy L Backx et al 381 European Journal of Human Genetics of patients presenting with unexplained early epileptic encephalopathy . In contrast to the central nervous system defects , our patient does not have a cardiac defect or signs of cardiomyopathy , suggesting that the amount of residual ErbB4 protein during fetal heart development and post - natal heart function is sufficient . Alternatively , we cannot exclude an important or redundant role for other ErbB family members , especially ErbB2 , during heart develop - ment in humans in contrast to mice . In addition , our patient has a unilateral multicystic kidney . Although two of the four known ErbB4 isoforms , JM - a and CYT - 2 , are specifically expressed in the kidney , renal anomalies were not reported in the ErbB4 (cid:2) / (cid:2) mice , neither in the surviving rescued mice . 6 , 7 Again , interspecies differences might account for this discrepancy , but we can not exclude other genetic or environmental factors .
