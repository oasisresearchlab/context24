Motivated by recent experimental evidence of motor - independent contractility , we propose a robust motor - free mechanism that can generate contraction in biopolymer networks without the need for substrate polarity . We show that contractility is a natural consequence of active binding / unbinding of crosslinkers that breaks the Principle of Detailed Balance , together with the asymmetric force - extension response of semiÔ¨Çexible biopolymers . We calculate the resulting contractile velocity using both a simple coarse - grained model and a more detailed microscopic model for a viscoelastic biopolymer network . Our model may provide an explanation of recent reports of motor - independent contractility in cells . Our results also suggest a mechanism for generating contractile forces in synthetic active materials . I . INTRODUCTION Living cells are known to be far from equilibrium . Pow - ered by metabolic components such as adenosine triphos - phate ( ATP ) , biophysical processes that cannot happen in equilibrium systems take place in living cells , including cell signaling [ 1 ] , genetic transcription and replication [ 2 ] and active force generation [ 3 ] . Most force generation in living cells is due to molecular motors , for example myosin motors in animal cells [ 4 ] . These motors perform directional motion on the substrate they bind to , thus generating force in various forms , from muscle contrac - tion [ 5 ] to internal stress of the cytoskeleton [ 6 ‚Äì 8 ] . During cell division , motors are also believed to be responsible for the contractile stress generated by the actomyosin ring [ 9 ‚Äì 12 ] . Recent experimental evidence , however , suggests that contractility may be generated in the absence of mo - tors [ 13 , 14 ] . In Ref . [ 13 ] it was found that myosin - II motors become immobilized shortly before cytokinesis in budding yeast . It was also shown that the contractil - ity of the actomyosin ring in Drosophila embryo remains unaÔ¨Äected even when motor activity is signiÔ¨Åcantly in - hibited [ 14 ] . Both experiments imply the existence of an underlying contractile mechanism other than molecular motors . Microscopically , molecular motors work with a mech - anism reminiscent of the Smoluchowski - Feynman ther - mal ratchet [ 15 ‚Äì 18 ] . By consuming and dissipating en - ergy provided by metabolic components , motors un - dergo a directed cycle of transitions among conforma - tional states [ 19 ] , while actively binding / unbinding in a way that violates the Principle of Detailed Balance ( DB ) [ 18 , 20 ‚Äì 23 ] . However , to generate directional mo - tion or force , an energy consuming reaction itself is insuf - Ô¨Åcient . It also requires a broken spatial symmetry which gives rise to a speciÔ¨Åc direction for the motion . This spatial asymmetry is usually due to the polarity of the substrate such as actin or microtubules , with well - deÔ¨Åned plus and minus ends , to which a motor such as myosin or kinesin couples . Theoretically , such asymmetry can be modeled as an asymmetric binding potential [ 16 ‚Äì 18 ] . Another spatial asymmetry present in living cells that has been studied extensively , is the non - linear elastic - ity of the semiÔ¨Çexible biopolymers [ 24 ‚Äì 26 ] . The biopoly - mers that form the cytoskeleton are usually much stiÔ¨Äer to bending than most synthetic polymers , leading to a competition between the entropy and the bending energy . As a result , the force - extension relation of the biopoly - mers exhibits a strong asymmetry : when under stress , the polymer stiÔ¨Äness nonlinearly increases up to 10 3 times [ 25 ‚Äì 30 ] , a phenomenon known as stress - stiÔ¨Äening . However , under compression a pN level force is enough to buckle the polymer , and make its stiÔ¨Äness vanish [ 31 ] . Such asymmetric force - extension relation , which origi - nates from the thermal Ô¨Çuctuations of bending deforma - tions , exists in most biopolymers including both polar Ô¨Ålaments ( e . g . actin and microtubule ) and apolar Ô¨Åla - ments ( e . g . intermediate Ô¨Ålaments ( IF ) ) . This asymme - try in contraction vs expansion , is a potential source of broken spatial symmetry . In Ref . [ 32 ] , we have proposed a motor - independent contractile mechanism based on two key elements : ( i ) ac - tive binding / unbinding of non - motor crosslinkers which breaks DB and ( ii ) the asymmetric force - extension rela - tion of biopolymers that prefers contraction over expan - sion . We have developed both a simple coarse - grained model and a detailed microscopic model to demonstrate the mechanism for a viscous or elastic substrate . In this paper , we extend our previous work [ 32 ] to include vis - coelastic substrates and discuss the interplay between the binding / unbinding times and the substrate relaxation time . Our proposed mechanism generates robust contrac - tility for any viscoelastic substrates and any asymmetric force - extension . This model may not only provide a basis for understanding recent reports of myosin - independent a r X i v : 2 204 . 00222v2 [ c ond - m a t . s o f t ] 3 M a y 2022 2 Activity ùë∑ ( ‚Ñì ) ùê®ùêß ‚Ñì - 0 . 6 - 0 . 4 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 2 4 6 Semiflexible Two - spring ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 1 .

Both PMFs show strong asymmetry , being potential sources of broken spatial symmetry . contractility in cells , but also suggests a mechanism that can be used for active force generation in synthetic ma - terials . II . OVERVIEW In this work , we consider an unpolarized , disordered network formed by crosslinked semiÔ¨Çexible polymers ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) in which molecular motors cannot create con - traction using their power stroke [ 18 ] . For simplicity , we focus on one particular polymer segment and treat the rest of the network as a continuum viscoelastic sub - strate that the particular polymer can bind ( unbind ) to ( from ) . In the unbound state , there is no interaction between the polymer and the substrate , while in the bound state , the polymer exerts tension on the substrate , œÑ ( (cid:96) ) = dU e ( (cid:96) ) / d(cid:96) , resulting in an average contractile force (cid:104) F s (cid:105) (cid:96) = (cid:90) P on ( (cid:96) ) œÑ ( (cid:96) ) d (cid:96) . ( 1 ) Here (cid:96) is the polymer end - to - end length , U e is the poten - tial of mean - force ( PMF ) of the polymer , and P on is the probability for the polymer to have a given end - to - end distance (cid:96) in the bound state . If the binding and un - binding processes are in equilibrium , DB is satisÔ¨Åed and P on ( (cid:96) ) is governed by a Boltzmann distribution , leading to vanishing contractile force . However , when the bind - ing and / or unbinding process are out of equilibrium , e . g . , driven by consumption or catalysis of a metabolic com - ponent such as ATP , P on can be non - Boltzmann . For a viscous substrate with drag coeÔ¨Écient Œ≥ , the contractile force (cid:104) F s (cid:105) (cid:96) creates an average contractile velocity , v = (cid:104) F s (cid:105) (cid:96) / Œ≥ . ( 2 ) As discussed in the introduction , in order to have directed motion both time - reversal symmetry and spa - tial symmetry have to be broken [ 15 , 16 , 33 ] . To see the manifestation of this principle within our model it is instructive to view the active process as an addi - tional non - thermal noise on timescales longer than the binding / unbinding time [ 34 ‚Äì 36 ] , which causes random expansion or contraction of the polymer segment and breaks time - reversal symmetry . Such athermal noise usually tends to broaden the distribution P on [ 37 ] , see e . g . Fig . 1 ( b ) . Notably , this active noise , which breaks time - reversal symmetry , cannot induce contraction or any directed motion without having some spatial sym - metry broken [ 15 ] . This can be seen from Eq . ( 1 ) , where symmetric œÑ together with symmetric P on ( from symme - try arguments all directions are the same ) must lead to vanishing force . If œÑ ( also the PMF , since œÑ is its deriva - tive ) is asymmetric , and speciÔ¨Åcally , soft to compression and hard to extension , a symmetric or nearly symmetric P on naturally leads to a positive contractile force . This can be understood intuitively : the polymer has equal chances to be extended or compressed by the active pro - cess . It exerts a large contractile force on the substrate when extended , while exerting a small expanding force when compressed , which on average leads to contractil - ity . The PMF of semiÔ¨Çexible polymers has exactly these re - quired properties : it stiÔ¨Äens under extension and softens under compression , see Fig . 1 ( c ) . The force - extension re - lation for a semi - Ô¨Çexible polymer is [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] [ 24 , 31 , 38 ‚Äì 40 ] : (cid:96) ( œÑ ) ‚àí (cid:96) 0 (cid:104) ‚àÜ (cid:96) (cid:105) = (cid:96) 0 (cid:104) ‚àÜ (cid:96) (cid:105) œÑ ¬µ + Œµ (cid:18) œÑ œÑ 0 (cid:18) 1 + œÑ ¬µ (cid:19)(cid:19) , ( 3 ) where œÑ 0 ‚â° œÄ 2 k B T / ( 6 (cid:104) ‚àÜ (cid:96) (cid:105) ) is a characteristic tension , and (cid:104) ‚àÜ (cid:96) (cid:105) (cid:39) (cid:96) 20 / ( 6 (cid:96) p ) is the mean end - to - end thermal contraction of a stiÔ¨Ä polymer of rest length (cid:96) 0 and persis - tence length (cid:96) p . Here , ¬µ is the enthalpic stretch modulus , k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is the temperature and Œµ ( œÜ ) = 1 ‚àí 3 œÄ ‚àö œÜ coth ( œÄ ‚àö œÜ ) ‚àí 1 œÄ 2 œÜ [ 31 ] . As discussed above , the robustness of the contractility does not depend on the speciÔ¨Åc form of the asymmetric PMF . To illustrate 3 this we will also use a simple and analytically tractable two - spring PMF œÑ ( (cid:96) ) = (cid:40) K 1 ( (cid:96) ‚àí (cid:96) 0 ) ( (cid:96) < (cid:96) 0 ) K 2 ( (cid:96) ‚àí (cid:96) 0 ) ( (cid:96) ‚â• (cid:96) 0 ) , ( 4 ) where K 1 < K 2 are two diÔ¨Äerent spring constants under compression and extension . The paper is organized as follows . We Ô¨Årst detail our calculation of the contractile velocity for the coarse - grained model with a viscous substrate ( Sec . III ) , which has been discussed in our previous work [ 32 ] . We then introduce a microscopic model which accounts for the details of the binding / unbinding process , and discuss the contractile velocity for a substrate characterized by the Maxwell model ( Sec . IV ) . We show that , a viscoelastic substrate is equivalent to a viscous substrate with a mod - iÔ¨Åed binding potential ( Sec . IV ) . Next , we discuss the conditions in which our microscopic model reduces to the coarse - grained one ( see Sec . IV ) . In Sec . V we draw our conclusions . III . A SIMPLE COARSE - GRAINED MODEL We begin with a simple coarse - grained model to demonstrate how contractility can originate in an apo - lar substrate . As explained above , we consider a single polymer that binds to / unbinds from the substrate with rates œâ on / 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä ( the factor of 2 accounts for the fact that both of the two polymer ends can unbind ) . When DB is obeyed the binding and unbinding rates are related by œâ on = 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä exp ( ‚àí U b ) , where U b is the binding potential which is usually rugged [ 18 , 41 ] . The rugged binding po - tential suggests that in DB œâ on and / or œâ oÔ¨Ä should vary according to the binding and unbinding position . Here we break DB in the simplest way by assuming that both œâ on and œâ oÔ¨Ä are constants [ 18 ] . To start , consider a single binding / unbinding event that is divided into the follow - ing steps : ( i ) in the unbound state the polymer length (cid:96) u is assumed to relax fast to an equilibrium distribu - tion with rest length (cid:96) 0 , P eq ( (cid:96) u ) = exp [ ‚àí U e ( (cid:96) u ) / k B T ] / Z , where Z = (cid:82) d (cid:96) u exp [ ‚àí U e ( (cid:96) u ) / k B T ] is the partition func - tion ( Fig . 1 ( b ) ) , ( ii ) the polymer binds to the substrate at rate œâ on ; at the same time , its initial end - to - end length changes from (cid:96) u to (cid:96) b due to the binding , with proba - bility P b ( (cid:96) b ) , ( iii ) once the polymer binds , it contracts the viscous substrate due to its PMF , U e , and ( iv ) the polymer actively unbinds at constant rate 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä . Here , we neglect thermal aspects of unbinding that we assume to be dominated by active processes . In this coarse - grained model , the details of the sub - strate binding potential are neglected . The eÔ¨Äect of the binding process is modeled as an immediate change of the polymer length from (cid:96) u ( before binding ) to (cid:96) b ( af - ter binding ) . Such a change in length is a result of the rugged binding potential of biopolymers [ 18 , 41 ] . The probability that the polymer length has changed from (cid:96) u to (cid:96) b due to binding is denoted by P c ( (cid:96) b , (cid:96) u ) , such that the binding probability ( the polymer length distribution just after binding to the substrate ) is : P b ( (cid:96) b ) = (cid:90) d (cid:96) u P eq ( (cid:96) u ) P c ( (cid:96) b , (cid:96) u ) . ( 5 ) In general the distribution P c depends on the form of both the binding potential and the elastic PMF . In the limit where the binding potential is much larger than PMF , P c is dominated by the substrate binding poten - tial . Then , for a homogeneous substrate P c is only a func - tion of the length change ( translational symmetry ) [ 32 ] , P c ( (cid:96) u , (cid:96) b ) = P c ( (cid:96) u ‚àí (cid:96) b ) . Further assuming a symmet - ric binding potential , which is the case for e . g . isotropic substrate or a substrate consisting of apolar Ô¨Ålaments , we Ô¨Ånd P c is symmetric around (cid:96) u = (cid:96) b . Note that we choose a symmetric binding potential as a ‚Äòworst - case scenario‚Äô in which common motor activity is inhibited , although our mechanism does not rely on this symmetry . The simplest form of the binding probability is charac - terized by a single length scale d that can be associated with the typical spacing between binding sites : P c ( | (cid:96) b ‚àí (cid:96) u | ) = 1 d for | (cid:96) b ‚àí (cid:96) u | < d 2 , ( 6 ) and P c = 0 otherwise . In our model P c is a uniform distribution on ( ‚àí d / 2 , d / 2 ) , but any symmetric ( or even slightly asymmetric ) P c leads to contractility . After the polymer binds to the substrate with initial length (cid:96) b at t = 0 , it contracts the substrate due to its elastic energy . The polymer length in the bound state , (cid:96) f , thus changes over time . For a viscous substrate with drag coeÔ¨Écient Œ≥ , the survival probability for (cid:96) f , P ( (cid:96) f ; t ) ( probability that at time t the polymer is still bound to the substrate and has length (cid:96) f ) , follows a 1 - variable Fokker - Planck equation ( FPE ) ‚àÇ t P ( (cid:96) f ; t ) + ‚àÇ (cid:96) f J ( (cid:96) f ; t ) = ‚àí 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä P P ( (cid:96) f ; t = 0 ) = P b ( (cid:96) b = (cid:96) f ) , ( 7 ) where J = ‚àí ( k B T / Œ≥ ) ‚àÇP / ‚àÇ(cid:96) f ‚àí P‚àÇU e / ‚àÇ(cid:96) f . The con - stant unbinding rate 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä allows us to write P as P = P s exp ( ‚àí 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä ) , where the term exp ( ‚àí 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä ) is the prob - ability that the polymer is still bound at time t . The distribution P s then satisÔ¨Åes a standard FPE : ‚àÇ t P s ( (cid:96) f ; t ) + ‚àÇ (cid:96) f J s ( (cid:96) f ; t ) = 0 P s ( (cid:96) f ; t = 0 ) = P b ( (cid:96) b = (cid:96) f ) , ( 8 ) where J s = ‚àí ( k B T / Œ≥ ) ‚àÇP s / ‚àÇ(cid:96) f ‚àí P s ‚àÇU e / ‚àÇ(cid:96) f . Solving Eq . ( 8 ) gives the distribution P s , from which the steady state distribution P on is calculated : P on ( (cid:96) ) = C on (cid:90) d t ¬∑ 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä P s ( (cid:96) f = (cid:96) ; t ) e ‚àí 2 œâ off t , ( 9 ) 4 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 - 4 10 0 10 4 1 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 - 0 . 2 - 0 . 1 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Figure 2 . Numerical results for the contractile velocity . ( a ) Contractile velocity as function of the typical binding - site spacing for Àú Œ≥ ‚Üí ‚àû . For the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF , we use ¬µ = 4 . 37 √ó 10 ‚àí 8 N , œÑ 0 = 0 . 68pN , (cid:96) 0 = 1 ¬µ m , Œ¥(cid:96) = 6 . 2nm , while for the two - spring PMF we choose K 2 = ¬µ / (cid:96) 0 and K 1 = 0 . 35 œÑ 0 / Œ¥(cid:96) ( both PMFs are chosen to have the same Œ¥(cid:96) ) . The solid purple line is the large - d analytical solution of Eq . ( 12 ) and the solid red line is the small - d analytical solution of Eq . ( 16 ) . In ( b ) and ( c ) we plot the force - velocity relation for the two - spring and the semiÔ¨Çexible PMFs , respectively . The dimensionless quantities used are : Àú d = d / Œ¥(cid:96) , Àú Œ≥ = 2 Œ≥œâ oÔ¨Ä Œ¥(cid:96) / œÑ 0 , Àú v = v / ( 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä Œ¥(cid:96) ) and Àú F = F / œÑ 0 . Parameters used : ( b ) Àú d = 0 . 1 , and ( c ) Àú d = 10 . Both Àú F and Àú Œ≥ Àú v are further rescaled according to their d dependence ( quadratic for large Àú d and linear for small Àú d ) . In ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) œâ on (cid:29) œâ oÔ¨Ä . with C on = œâ on / ( œâ on + 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä ) being the probability to be in the bound state . We then Ô¨Ånd the contractile force , (cid:104) F s (cid:105) (cid:96) through Eq . ( 1 ) , and the average contractile veloc - ity through Eq . ( 2 ) . In Fig . 2 ( a ) we numerically calculate the contractile ve - locity for both the semiÔ¨Çexible and the two - spring PMFs . We Ô¨Ånd positive contractile velocity for both PMFs , sug - gesting that our contractile mechanism is robust for any asymmetric elastic PMF that is hard to stretch and soft to compress . For both PMFs , the d - dependences of the velocity are similar . The velocity increases monotonically with d , with diÔ¨Äerent scaling dependences in two regimes separated by a characteristic lengthscale Œ¥(cid:96) . Here , Œ¥(cid:96) is deÔ¨Åned to be the root - mean - square Ô¨Çuactuations of the polymer end - to - end length under its equilibrium distri - bution . Its value is Œ¥(cid:96) = (cid:112) ( œÄ ‚àí 2 ) k B T / ( œÄK 1 ) for two - spring PMF ( assuming K 1 (cid:28) K 2 ) and Œ¥(cid:96) = (cid:96) 20 / ( ‚àö 90 (cid:96) p ) for semiÔ¨Çexible PMF ( see supplementary material of Ref . [ 32 ] ) . For d (cid:28) Œ¥(cid:96) , a quadratic d - dependence is ob - served , while for d (cid:29) Œ¥(cid:96) we Ô¨Ånd that v ‚àº d . The diÔ¨Äerent scaling exponents in these two limits originate in diÔ¨Äerent proÔ¨Åles of P on : In the large - Ô¨Çuctuation limit ( Œ¥(cid:96) (cid:29) d ) , P on is only slightly perturbed from the equilibrium distri - bution P eq , while in the small - Ô¨Çuctuation limit ( Œ¥(cid:96) (cid:28) d ) , P on is almost independent of P eq . Below we discuss in detail these two limits . A . Small - Ô¨Çuctuation limit One can always write the corresponding Langevin equation of the FPE Eq . ( 8 ) using standard methods [ 42 ] . For Œ¥(cid:96) (cid:28) d , thermal Ô¨Çuctuations are small enough that we can neglect the thermal term in the Langevin equa - tion . In this case , for a given binding length (cid:96) b , the poly - mer length in the bound state is uniquely determined by a trajectory (cid:96) ‚àó f ( (cid:96) b ; t ) which follows a Langevin equation that corresponds to Eq . ( 8 ) : Œ≥ d (cid:96) ‚àó f ( (cid:96) b ; t ) d t = ‚àí œÑ (cid:0) (cid:96) ‚àó f (cid:1) (cid:96) ‚àó f ( (cid:96) b ; t = 0 ) = (cid:96) b , ( 10 ) where œÑ ( (cid:96) f ) = U (cid:48) e ( (cid:96) f ) is the polymer tension . In Eq . ( 8 ) , for a given binding length (cid:96) b , i . e . , an initial condition P s ( (cid:96) f ; t = 0 ) = Œ¥ ( (cid:96) f ‚àí (cid:96) b ) , the trajectory in Eq . ( 10 ) gives a solution of Eq . ( 8 ) , P s = Œ¥ ( (cid:96) f ‚àí (cid:96) ‚àó f ) , where Œ¥ ( x ) is the Dirac Œ¥ - function . Therefore , the resulting P s from the binding probability P b ( (cid:96) b ) , is the average probability distribution of trajectories starting with all possible (cid:96) b P s ( (cid:96) f ; t ) = (cid:90) d (cid:96) b P b ( (cid:96) b ) Œ¥ (cid:2) (cid:96) f ‚àí (cid:96) ‚àó f ( (cid:96) b ; t ) (cid:3) . ( 11 ) The steady - state distribution in the bound state is then calculated by solving Eq . ( 11 ) and substituting P s into Eq . ( 9 ) . Then , the contractile velocity can be found with the help of Eq . ( 1 ) and Eq . ( 2 ) . For the two - spring PMF , this velocity assumes a simple form : v = dC on Œ≥œâ 2oÔ¨Ä ( K 2 ‚àí K 1 ) 8 ( K 1 + Œ≥œâ oÔ¨Ä ) ( K 2 + Œ≥œâ oÔ¨Ä ) , ( 12 ) which depends linearly on d . This expression is in per - fect agreement with the numerical solution of the FPE , Eq . ( 8 ) , see Fig . 2 ( a ) . The contractile velocity for the semiÔ¨Çexible potential cannot be found analytically , because the potential does not have an explicit analytical expression . However , in the Œ¥(cid:96) (cid:28) d limit , the force - extension relation of the semi - Ô¨Çexible PMF has two asymptotic limits , for large stretch or compression [ 31 ] : œÑ ( (cid:96) ) ‚âà Ô£± Ô£≤ Ô£≥ ¬µ (cid:96) 0 ( (cid:96) ‚àí (cid:96) 0 ) ( (cid:96) ‚àí (cid:96) 0 (cid:29) Œ¥(cid:96) ) ‚àí œÑ 0 ( (cid:96) 0 ‚àí (cid:96) (cid:29) Œ¥(cid:96) ) . ( 13 ) Therefore , if we approximate the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF by a two - spring PMF with K 2 = ¬µ / (cid:96) 0 and K 1 (cid:28) K 2 , the two 5 PMFs generate the same average force just after binding ( K 1 does not aÔ¨Äect the average force as long as K 1 (cid:28) K 2 ) . In Fig . 2 ( a ) we show that the contractile velocity of the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF coincides with that of the two - spring PMF in the small - Ô¨Çuctuation ( large - d ) limit , given the proper choice of the two - spring parameters . To be speciÔ¨Åc , we let the two PMFs have the same Œ¥(cid:96) . For this aim we set K 1 = 3 . 32 œÑ 0 (cid:96) p / (cid:96) 20 = 0 . 35 œÑ 0 / Œ¥(cid:96) such that the two spring PMF gives the same Œ¥(cid:96) with the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF . B . Large - Ô¨Çuctuation limit For Œ¥(cid:96) (cid:29) d , thermal noise cannot be neglected , but the change in length due to the binding is relatively small . Then , P b is only slightly perturbed from the equilib - rium distribution in the unbound state . Expanding P b of Eq . ( 5 ) to second order in d gives P b ( (cid:96) b ) (cid:39) P eq ( (cid:96) b ) (cid:20) 1 + d 2 24 (cid:18) U (cid:48) 2 e ( (cid:96) b ) ( k B T ) 2 ‚àí U (cid:48)(cid:48) e ( (cid:96) b ) k B T (cid:19)(cid:21) , ( 14 ) where f (cid:48) ( (cid:96) b ) = [ d f ( (cid:96) ) / d (cid:96) ] (cid:96) = (cid:96) b and f (cid:48)(cid:48) ( (cid:96) b ) = [ d 2 f ( (cid:96) ) / d (cid:96) 2 ] (cid:96) = (cid:96) b . Since both the FPEs of Eq . ( 8 ) and Eq . ( 9 ) are linear , the resulting P on is similarly perturbed around the equilibrium distribution , where the deviation scales as d 2 . Thus , from Eq . ( 1 ) we have (cid:104) F s (cid:105) (cid:96) ‚àº d 2 , and the contractile velocity shows quadratic dependences on d , as is seen in Fig . 2 ( a ) . To show this explicitly , let us consider a nearly rigid substrate , i . e . , Àú Œ≥ ‚Üí ‚àû . In this case the polymer is not relaxing in the bound state ( i . e . , P on ( (cid:96) ) = C on P b ( (cid:96) b = (cid:96) ) ) , and produces an average contractile force ( on the substrate ) of (cid:104) F s (cid:105) (cid:96) = C on d 2 24 (cid:90) d (cid:96) b P eq ( (cid:96) b ) U (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) e ( (cid:96) b ) , ( 15 ) where we have used Eqs . ( 1 ) and ( 14 ) . This force is pos - itive for any potential with positive U (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) e ( (cid:96) ) . Note that the above result is obtained for constant on / oÔ¨Ä rates . In case that the on / oÔ¨Ä rates obey detailed balance , P on would remain the equilibrium distribution even for Ô¨Ånite d and (cid:104) F s (cid:105) (cid:96) would vanish . For the two - spring PMF , the contractile force calculated from Eq . ( 15 ) leads to a con - tractile velocity : v = C on ( K 2 ‚àí K 1 ) ‚àö K 1 d 2 12 ‚àö 2 œÄk B TŒ≥ , ( 16 ) which agrees perfectly to the numerical results in the small - d limit , see Fig . 2 ( a ) . For the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF , numerical result gives v ‚âà 0 . 24 d 2 œÑ 0 / ( Œ¥(cid:96) 2 Œ≥ ) . Comparing this result with Eq . ( 16 ) , we Ô¨Ånd that by setting K 1 = 0 . 35 œÑ 0 / Œ¥(cid:96) and K 2 = 13 œÑ 0 / Œ¥(cid:96) , the two - spring PMF gives the same contractile velocity with the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF in the small d limit , which is conÔ¨Årmed by our numerical results , see Fig . 2 ( a ) . Here , the value of K 1 is chosen to be the same as that in Sec . III A , such that the two - spring PMF has the same Œ¥(cid:96) with the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF . We then set the value of K 2 such that Eq . ( 16 ) gives the same velocity as the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF . Together with previous discussion on the small - Ô¨Çuctuation limit , this suggests that given the proper parameter choice , the two - spring PMF can mimic the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF both in the small and large - Ô¨Çuctuation limits . Having illustrated the coarse - grained model in two ex - treme limits , let us consider a property that is commonly measured for molecular motors , the force - velocity rela - tion . This relation describes a motor‚Äôs ability to do work under an external load . Since our non - motor mechanism creates motor - like contraction , it is also useful to com - pute the force - velocity relation in our model . To cal - culate this relation , we exert a constant tension F on the two ends of the polymer . The constant force modi - Ô¨Åes the elastic potential of Eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) from U e ( (cid:96) f ) to U e ( (cid:96) f ) ‚àí F(cid:96) f . In Fig . 2 ( b ) - ( c ) we plot force - velocity curves for the small and large d limits , respectively . In Fig . 2 ( b ) we use the two - spring PMF , while in Fig . 2 ( c ) we use the semiÔ¨Çexible polymer PMF . In both cases , the velocity is reduced by an applied load , in a way similar to molecular motors [ 43 ] . We Ô¨Ånd that decreasing the dimensionless viscosity Àú Œ≥ results in lower velocities and correspondingly lower stall forces , due to the increased compliance and stress relaxation of the substrate . IV . MICROSCOPIC MODEL Having demonstrated our mechanism using a simple coarse - grained model , let us switch to a more complete microscopic model . We will later show how the coarse - grained model can be derived as a limit of this micro - scopic model . In this model , we still study the active binding / unbinding of a semiÔ¨Çexible segment on a vis - coelastic substrate where the details of the binding po - tential will be considered . As sketched in Fig . 3 ( a ) , we consider a semiÔ¨Çexible seg - ment whose two ends , A and B , bind and unbind to two regions on a viscoelastic substrate denoted as S A and S B . Each of the substrate regions represents a small part of the entire substrate , and they can move independently to each other or the rest of the substrate . The substrate regions are assumed to be rigid and their positions are de - noted by y A and y B , respectively . We consider a Maxwell substrate by connecting each substrate region with the rest of the substrate with a viscous damper of mobility m y and a spring of spring constant K in series . Let y e A and y vA be the lengths of the elastic and viscous parts of the substrate region S A , and similarly deÔ¨Åne y eB and y vB ( note that these lengths can be negative as they are measured relative to the initial positions ) . These lengths satisfy y A , B = y eA , B + y vA , B . 6 ( a ) - 1 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 ( b ) ( c ) Figure 3 . ( a ) Illustration for the microscopic model . Two ends of a polymer actively bind to and unbind from two regions of a Maxwell substrate . Each of the substrate regions is connected to the rest of the network via a viscous damper and an elastic spring . Each of the polymer ends binds to the substrate region with a triangular binding potential ( upper right ) . ( b ) ProÔ¨Åle of the modiÔ¨Åed binding potential U vb for various rescaled substrate spring constants , Àú K = Kd 2 / ‚àÜ E . The height of U vb increases with Àú K and reaches U b when Àú K ‚Üí ‚àû . ( c ) Rescaled contractile velocity , Àú v = v / ( œâ oÔ¨Ä Œ¥(cid:96) ) , as function of Àú K , for various ratios between the substrate relaxation time œÑ s = 1 / ( Km y ) and the unbinding time œÑ oÔ¨Ä . The velocity increases monotonically with Àú K and approaches its maximum as Àú K (cid:29) 1 . The PMF is the same as the semiÔ¨Çexible PMF used in Fig . 2 . In ( c ) d = 10nm . The two polymer ends ( crosslinkers ) can be thought as particles moving within the substrate with eÔ¨Äective mo - bility m x , whose positions are denoted by x A and x B , re - spectively . The polymer end A ( B ) , successively binds to and unbinds from the substrate region S A ( S B ) . When A ( B ) is unbound , there is no interaction between the poly - mer end A ( B ) and the substrate region S A ( S B ) . When A ( B ) is bound to S A ( S B ) , the polymer end interacts with the substrate region via an eÔ¨Äective binding poten - tial , U b ( x A ‚àí y A ) ( U b ( x B ‚àí y B ) ) . The binding potentials of biopolymers are usually rugged due to the microscopic structure of the monomers . Since we assume the sub - strate is apolar , these potentials should be symmetric . For simplicity , we assume U b to be a periodic triangular potential of depth ‚àÜ E and period d , although periodic - ity is not essential . Lastly , the PMF of the polymer is U e ( x B ‚àí x A ) . The binding and unbinding rates of the two poly - mer ends are denoted by œâ on and œâ oÔ¨Ä , respectively . As discussed in the beginning of Sec . III , constant bind - ing / unbinding rates break DB , which together with a rugged binding potential and asymmetric elasticity can lead to a steady state substrate contraction . The polymer can only exert tension on the substrate when its two ends are bound to the substrate , and we deÔ¨Åne this state as the bound state . The unbound state is thus the state in which one or both polymer ends are unbound . We are interested in how the substrate length , deÔ¨Åned as y B ‚àí y A , changes during the bound state . For that aim we consider a bound state which starts at t = 0 . Just before t = 0 , one of the two ends must be bound to the substrate region while the other being unbound , so the system could enter the bound state . We assume the polymer end A is bound while B is unbound ( this is equivalent to the case in which B is bound while A is un - bound ) . At t = 0 , B binds to S B , and the system enters the bound state . While in the bound state , the polymer interacts with the substrate and deforms it . The evo - lution of the system is described by a survival probabil - ity P ve (cid:0) x A , B , y e A , B , y vA , B ; t (cid:1) ( each variable with subscript A , B stands for two variables with substripts A and B , respectively ) . The bound state ends at t = t e , when one of the polymer ends unbinds from the substrate . The dis - tribution of t e is exponential with unbinding rate 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä ( derivation is as in the paragraph before Eq . ( 8 ) ) , where the factor of two is due to the fact that the unbinding of either polymer ends terminates the bound state . During a single binding / unbinding event , the average contraction of the substrate is deÔ¨Åned as ‚àÜ y = (cid:104) y vB ‚àí y vA (cid:105) t = 0 ‚àí (cid:104) y vB ‚àí y vA (cid:105) t = t e , ( 17 ) where (cid:104) y vB ‚àí y vA (cid:105) t = 0 = (cid:90) DxDy ( y vB ‚àí y vA ) √ó P ve (cid:0) x A , B , y eA , B , y vA , B ; t = 0 (cid:1) (cid:104) y vB ‚àí y vA (cid:105) t = t e = 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä (cid:90) ‚àû 0 d t e (cid:90) DxDy ( y vB ‚àí y vA ) √ó P ve (cid:0) x A , B , y eA , B , y vA , B ; t = t e (cid:1) ( 18 ) are the average values of y vB ‚àí y vA at the start and at the end of the bound state . Here Dx = d x A d x B and D y = d y eA d y eB d y vA d y vB . In Eq . ( 18 ) we only consider the viscous parts of the substrate , because the elastic parts relax immediately to their rest lengths in the unbound state , and the lengths of the viscous parts are the only lengths that show changes due to the relaxation in the bound state . The contractile velocity is calculated using v = ‚àÜ y / T , where T is the average time between two bind - ing / unbinding events . By deÔ¨Ånition , T is the sum of the average lifetimes in the bound and unbound states . The average lifetime of the polymer in the bound state ( both ends are bound ) is œÑ oÔ¨Ä = 1 / 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä . The average lifetime in the unbound state is more complicated as it 7 is composed of two diÔ¨Äerent states : ( a ) both ends are unbound , and ( b ) only one end is unbound . The prob - abilities to be in these two states can be written as , C a = ( 1 ‚àí C on ) 2 , C b = 2 C on ( 1 ‚àí C on ) , respectively . Here C on = œâ on / ( œâ on + œâ oÔ¨Ä ) is the fraction of time in which one of the polymer ends is bound to the substrate ( regardless of the other polymer end ) , see also Eq . ( 9 ) . Therefore , when the polymer is in the bound state , the probabili - ties to be in states ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are , P a = C a / ( C a + C b ) and P b = C b / ( C a + C b ) , respectively . Since the unbound state can only be ended when the system is in state ( 2 ) , the net binding rate , given that the polymer is in the unbound state , is œâ ‚àó on = P b œâ on , and the average lifetime of the unbound state is œÑ on = 1 / œâ ‚àó oÔ¨Ä . Taken together , we have T = œÑ oÔ¨Ä + œÑ on = 1 / ( 2 C 2on œâ oÔ¨Ä ) . In the bound state , the evolution of the system can be described by six variables : x A , B , y eA , B and y vA , B , with the total potential energy W ve (cid:0) x A , B , y eA , B , y vA , B (cid:1) : W ve = U e ( x B ‚àí x A ) + U b ( x B ‚àí y eB ‚àí y vB ) + U b ( x A ‚àí y eA ‚àí y vA ) + K 2 ( y eA ) 2 + K 2 ( y eB ) 2 . ( 19 ) Note that we set the rest lengths of both y eA and y eB to zero for simplicity . In general , the survival probability of the sys - tem should also be described by these 6 variables , P ve (cid:0) x A , B , y eA , B , y vA , B ; t (cid:1) . However , we can eliminate y eA and y eB since they obtain their deformed values instanta - neously , such that they can always be considered as fast variables . Therefore , we can describe the system dynam - ics using a 4 - variable survival probability P v [ 33 ] : P ve = exp [ ‚àí W ve / k B T ] Z v (cid:16) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:17) P v (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B ; t (cid:1) . ( 20 ) with Z v = (cid:82) d y eA d y eB exp ( ‚àí W ve / k B T ) . The evolution of P v satisÔ¨Åes a FPE , ‚àÇ t P v + ‚àá ¬∑ J v = ‚àí 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä P v , ( 21 ) with J Œ± = ‚àí m Œ± ( k B T‚àÇ Œ± P v + P v ‚àÇ Œ± W v ) without the sum - mation convention . Here m Œ± = m x for Œ± = x A , B and m Œ± = m y for Œ± = y vA , B . Notably , this FPE is governed by an eÔ¨Äective potential W v (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) : W v = (cid:90) d y eA d y eB exp ( ‚àí W ve / k B T ) Z v (cid:16) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:17) √ó W ve (cid:0) x A , B , y eA , B , y vA , B (cid:1) = U e ( x B ‚àí x A ) + U vb ( x B ‚àí y vB ) + U vb ( x A ‚àí y vA ) . ( 22 ) Surprisingly , we Ô¨Ånd this eÔ¨Äective potential to have the same form as the original total potential energy of a pure viscous substrate ( see discussion later on the viscous sub - strate ) , but with a modiÔ¨Åed binding potential U vb ( x ) = (cid:90) d y exp (cid:2) ‚àí [ U b ( x ‚àí y ) + K 2 y 2 ] / k B T (cid:3) Z b ( x ) √ó (cid:20) U b ( x ‚àí y ) + K 2 y 2 (cid:21) , ( 23 ) where Z b ( x ) = (cid:82) d y exp (cid:2) ‚àí [ U b ( x ‚àí y ) + Ky 2 / 2 ] / k B T (cid:3) . This suggests that a viscoelastic substrate is equivalent to a viscous substrate with a modiÔ¨Åed binding potential U vb . The eÔ¨Äective potential U vb couples the original binding potential U b and the elastic energy of the substrate . Same as the bare binding potential , it is periodic with period d , but the proÔ¨Åle of each potential well is Ô¨Çattened by the elastic energy ( see Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . For K (cid:29) ‚àÜ E / d 2 , the substrate shows almost a pure viscous response , where U vb ‚âà U b . For smaller K , U vb deviates from U b , and for K (cid:28) ‚àÜ E / d 2 , U vb becomes entirely Ô¨Çat . This is because when K ‚Üí ‚àû the Maxwell substrate reduces to a pure viscous substrate , and when K is small the elastic compli - ance of the substrate is weak and almost all the stress can be relaxed by the deformation of the elastic part , while the deformation of the viscous part is negligible . There - fore , in order to generate non - trivial contractility during the binding / unbinding events , the substrate rigidity K should be large enough ( K ‚â• ‚àÜ E / d 2 ) . To determine the initial condition of Eq . ( 21 ) , we need to specify the meaning of y vA and y vB . Since the substrate regions are deÔ¨Åned to be rigid , their positions can be rep - resented by any point within them . Here , for simplicity we choose y vA and y vB to be the positions of the nearest binding sites ( bottoms of the potential wells in U vb ) of A and B at t = 0 , respectively . Hence , at t = 0 we have | x A , B ‚àí y vA , B | ‚â§ d / 2 . Assuming the system relaxes fast in the unbound state , the initial condition is given by P v (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B ; t = 0 (cid:1) = œá (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) Z √ó exp (cid:16) ‚àí [ U e ( x B ‚àí x A ) + U vb ( x A ‚àí y A ) ] / k B T (cid:17) , ( 24 ) where Z = (cid:82) DxDy v P v is the partition function ( Dx = d x A d x B and Dy v = d y vA d y vB ) and œá (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) = Œò ( d / 2 ‚àí | x A ‚àí y vA | ) √ó Œò ( d / 2 ‚àí | x B ‚àí y vB | ) , ( 25 ) gives the boundaries of the initial condition ( Œò ( x ) is the Heaviside function ) . œá appears because we deÔ¨Åne the values of y vA and y vB at t = 0 to be the positions of the nearest binding sites of A and B . Note that U v b for the polymer end B is taken into account in the initial con - dition , because it is assumed to be bound and immobile during the binding of A . The survival probability at time t is then derived from Eq . ( 21 ) and ( 24 ) , which can be used to calculate the 8 contractile velocity . The large number of variables in the FPE prevents intuitive understanding of the dynamics , and further introduces diÔ¨Éculties in the numerical solu - tion . Below we will apply two physical conditions that reduces the 4 - variable FPE to a 1 - variable equation . First , we assume m x (cid:29) m y because m x is the mobility of one end of a single polymer , while m y stands for the mobility of a substrate region which is a collection of multiple polymers that feels larger friction than a single polymer end . To introduce the second condition we consider three key timescales in the system . The Ô¨Årst one is the time for a single polymer end to relax within one potential well , œÑ r = œÑ d ( k B T / ‚àÜ E v ) , where œÑ d = d 2 / 2 k B Tm x and ‚àÜ E v is the diÔ¨Äerence between the maximum and min - imum of U vb . The complete derivation of œÑ r , which is the so - called intrawell relaxation time [ 44 ] is provided in the Appendix . The second timescale is the time for the polymer end to hop to another potential well , œÑ hop = œÑ d exp ( ‚àÜ E v / k B T ) ( see Appendix for derivation ) . Lastly , the third timescale is the average lifetime in the bound state , œÑ oÔ¨Ä = 1 / ( 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä ) . In biopolymers ‚àÜ E is usu - ally much larger than k B T , and we assume ‚àÜ E v is also large enough such that œÑ r (cid:28) œÑ oÔ¨Ä (cid:28) œÑ hop . This requires the network rigidity K to be comparable or larger than ‚àÜ E / d 2 . Because the value of K is in principle propor - tional to the network density , the assumption is relevant for densely - crosslinked network . The relation between the three timescales implies that during the bound state the polymer end relaxes quickly within the initial po - tential well and unbinds before it can hop to another potential well . With these two physical conditions we simplify the FPE as follows . Since œÑ oÔ¨Ä (cid:28) œÑ hop , the probability that either of the polymer ends hops before unbinding is small , and both polymer ends are trapped in the potential wells to which they bind , indicating that P v ‚àº œá (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) . Furthermore , because œÑ r (cid:28) œÑ oÔ¨Ä and m x (cid:28) m y , we can treat x A and x B as fast variables , such that P v (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B ; t (cid:1) = exp (cid:2) ‚àí W v (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) / k B T (cid:3) Z Y (cid:16) y vA , B (cid:17) √ó œá (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) P vY (cid:0) y vA , B ; t (cid:1) , ( 26 ) with Z Y = (cid:82) d x A d x B œá e ‚àí W v / k B T . The distribution P v (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B ; t (cid:1) can thus be determined by its marginal distribution P vY (cid:0) y vA , B ; t (cid:1) . Substituting Eq . ( 26 ) into Eq . ( 21 ) , we have the reduced FPE for P v Y (cid:0) y v A , B ; t (cid:1) ‚àÇ t P vY (cid:0) y vA , B ; t (cid:1) + ‚àá ¬∑ J ‚àó (cid:0) y vA , B ; t (cid:1) = ‚àí 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä P vY , ( 27 ) with J ‚àó Œ± = ‚àí m y ( k B T‚àÇ Œ± P vY + P vY ‚àÇ Œ± W v ‚àó ) without the summation convention , and Œ± = y vA , B . Here W v ‚àó ( y vB ‚àí y vA ) = (cid:90) d x A d x B œá (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) Z Y (cid:16) y vA , B (cid:17) √ó W v (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) exp ( ‚àí W v / k B T ) ( 28 ) is the eÔ¨Äective interaction between the two substrate regions S A and S B . Note that W v ‚àó is a function of ( y vB ‚àí y vA ) because the original interaction potential W is a function of relative positions , such that the substrate is translational invariant . Due to this symmetry , it is in - structive to perform a variable substitution : ( y vA , y vB ) ‚Üí ( y + , y ‚àí ) , where y + = y vA + y vB and y ‚àí = y vB ‚àí y vA . It is straightforward to verify that y + follows diÔ¨Äusional dy - namics with mobility m y , while the survival probability of y ‚àí satisÔ¨Åes the following 1 - variable FPE , ‚àÇ t P ‚àí ( y ‚àí ; t ) + ‚àÇ y ‚àí J ‚àí ( y ‚àí ; t ) = ‚àí 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä P ‚àí , ( 29 ) where J ‚àí = ‚àí 2 m y k B T‚àÇ y ‚àí P ‚àí + P ‚àí ‚àÇ y ‚àí W v ‚àó . Equa - tion ( 29 ) suggests that the distance between the two sub - strate regions follows the same equation of motion as a particle diÔ¨Äusing in 1D under the inÔ¨Çuence of the poten - tial W v ‚àó . The eÔ¨Äective interaction W v ‚àó is essentially the averaged W in the equilibrium distribution of x A and x B . As shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) , W v ‚àó becomes asymmetric for any rescaled substrate spring constant , Àú K = Kd 2 / ‚àÜ E , and its shape becomes more asymmetric for increasing Àú K . When Àú K ‚Üí ‚àû , the substrate reduces to a pure vis - cous substrate and the proÔ¨Åle of W v ‚àó approaches that of W ‚àó , the eÔ¨Äective interaction for the viscous substrate ( see discussion later in this section ) . In the Àú K ‚Üí 0 limit in which the substrate is extremely soft , both U vb and W v ‚àó become Ô¨Çat and there is no interaction between the two substrate regions , resulting in vanishing contractil - ity . However , for any Ô¨Ånite value of Àú K , the proÔ¨Åle of W ‚àó will always be asymmetric for contraction and expansion , such that a positive contractile velocity is expected . In - terestingly , a particle moving in a periodic W v ‚àó is math - ematically equivalent to a motor binding on a polar Ô¨Ål - ament [ 18 ] , with the crucial distinction that the motor directional motion is dictated by the Ô¨Ålament polarity , while the motion here is always contractile in character . After obtaining the eÔ¨Äective potential , we use Eq . ( 29 ) to calculate the survival probability for y ‚àí and ‚àÜ y of Eq . ( 17 ) is ‚àÜ y = (cid:104) y ‚àí (cid:105) t = 0 ‚àí (cid:104) y ‚àí (cid:105) t = t e , ( 30 ) where the average at t = 0 and t = t e follows the same deÔ¨Ånition as in Eq . ( 18 ) , with the average being respect to P ‚àí instead of P ve . In Fig . 3 ( c ) we numerically calculate the contractile velocity as function of the rescaled substrate spring con - stant Àú K . The velocity increases monotonically with Àú K , as a result of the more asymmetric W v ‚àó for increasing Àú K . 9 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 0 2 4 6 8 10 10 0 10 1 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 2 Viscoelastic Viscous - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) Figure 4 . Numerical results for the microscopic model . ( a ) ProÔ¨Åle of the modiÔ¨Åed eÔ¨Äective interaction W v ‚àó , for various rescaled substrate spring constants , Àú K = Kd 2 / ‚àÜ E . W v ‚àó becomes more asymmetric for increasing Àú K and approaches W ‚àó of the viscous substrate limit ( see ( c ) ) when Àú K ‚Üí ‚àû . ( b ) Rescaled contractile velocity , Àú v = v / ( 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä Œ¥(cid:96) ) , as function of rescaled binding site spacing Àú d , for various Àú K values . The dependence on Àú d is non - monotonic . In the small Àú d limit the microscopic model reduces to the coarse - grained model . The maximum velocity is reached at Àú d ‚àº 1 . Dashed yellow line shows a realistic value d = 10nm with Œ¥(cid:96) = 6nm , which is close to the maximum - velocity location . ( c ) ProÔ¨Åle of the eÔ¨Äective interaction W ‚àó in the viscous limit , for various Àú d values . W ‚àó is more asymmetric for small d and approaches U b when Àú d ‚Üí ‚àû . ( d ) Rescaled contractile velocity as function of rescaled binding site spacing for various rescaled substrate mobility , Àú m y = m y œÑ 0 / ( 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä Œ¥(cid:96) ) values in the viscous substrate limit . Similarly to the viscoelastic case ( see ( b ) ) , the dependence on d is non - monotonic . PMF parameters are the same as that in Fig . 2 . The binding potential is the same as that in Fig . 3 . For K (cid:29) ‚àÜ E / d 2 , the velocity asymptotically converges to the velocity proÔ¨Åle for a viscous substrate . Therefore , to reach a maximum contractile velocity , the substrate rigidity should be much larger than ‚àÜ E / d 2 . The Maxwell substrate also introduces an intrinsic sub - strate relaxation time , œÑ s = 1 / ( Km y ) . If œÑ s (cid:28) œÑ oÔ¨Ä , where œÑ oÔ¨Ä = 1 / ( 2 œâ oÔ¨Ä ) is the average lifetime of the bound state , the substrate relaxes completely before the polymer un - binds , leading to a small contractile velocity . A mono - tonic dependence between the contractile velocity and the ratio œÑ s / œÑ oÔ¨Ä is observed in Fig . 3 ( c ) . Clearly , œÑ s / œÑ oÔ¨Ä must be large enough to reach a considerable contrac - tion . If œÑ s / œÑ oÔ¨Ä (cid:29) 1 , the substrate behaves almost like an elastic substrate with spring constant K , with v / m y being the contractile force exerted on the substrate . In this case the substrate relaxation can be neglected dur - ing a single binding / unbinding event , so the contractile force is not reduced by the substrate relaxation , leading to maximized contractile force . In Fig . 4 ( b ) we plot the relation between the contrac - tile velocity and the binding site spacing d . Interestingly , we Ô¨Ånd that in the small - d limit the velocities calculated from various Àú K values collapse on a single curve , which shows a quadratic dependence on d . This is not surpris - ing because the microscopic model reduces to the coarse - grained model in this limit . In fact , when we analyze Eq . ( 28 ) we Ô¨Ånd that the total energy W v is composed of two interactions , U e and U vb . The Ô¨Çuctuation length - scale of U e is Œ¥(cid:96) , while the distance between x A ( x B ) and y vA ( y vB ) is smaller than d / 2 , implying that in the d (cid:28) Œ¥(cid:96) limit we can approximate U e ( x B ‚àí x A ) with U e ( y vB ‚àí y vA ) . Furthermore , when ‚àÜ E v (cid:29) k B T we have exp ( ‚àí U vb ( x ) / k B T ) ‚âà (cid:40) 1 ( x = nd ) 0 ( x (cid:54) = nd ) , ( 31 ) where n is any integer . Substituting Eq . ( 31 ) and U e ( x B ‚àí x A ) = U e ( y vB ‚àí y vA ) into Eq . ( 28 ) gives W v ‚àó = U e . This suggests that the 1 - variable FPE in Eq . ( 29 ) is iden - tical to Eq . ( 7 ) in the coarse - grained model , with y ‚àí and 2 m y in Eq . ( 29 ) replaced by (cid:96) f , 1 / Œ≥ in Eq . ( 7 ) . There - fore , the microscopic model can be reduced to the coarse - grained model in the small - d limit ( when ‚àÜ E v (cid:29) k B T ) . In this case , the details of the eÔ¨Äective binding potential U vb are not important , and the contractile velocity of the microscopic model for any K value is the same as that of the coarse - grained model . We also Ô¨Ånd that the contractile velocity shows a non - monotonic dependence on d in Fig . 4 ( b ) . The velocity increases with d for d (cid:28) Œ¥(cid:96) , decreases with d for d (cid:29) Œ¥(cid:96) , and reaches its maximum at d ‚àº Œ¥(cid:96) . When d is large , the eÔ¨Äective binding potential U vb essentially becomes Ô¨Çat , weakening its ability to stretch or compress the polymer when it binds . This also explains the diÔ¨Äerent predictions of the microscopic model and the coarse - grained model in the large - d limit . The coarse - grained model is valid only when the change in U e is smaller than the binding potential , see discussion after Eq . ( 5 ) . Since the change in the polymer length is of the order of d , the change in U e can be approximated by U e ( (cid:96) 0 + d ) , which increases dramatically with d when d > Œ¥(cid:96) . Therefore , for d (cid:29) Œ¥(cid:96) we have U e ‚â• ‚àÜ E v , which suggests that the eÔ¨Äective binding potential does not have suÔ¨Écient energy to de - form the polymer , and the maximum velocity is always reached at d ‚àº Œ¥(cid:96) . We also Ô¨Ånd that the value of d at the 10 maximum velocity is larger for increasing Àú K ( Fig . 4 ( b ) ) , due to the fact that ‚àÜ E v increases with Àú K ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) . Fig . 4 ( b ) implies that the values of d and Œ¥(cid:96) needs to be close enough for considerable contraction . Biologically , the value of d is Ô¨Åxed for a given substrate Ô¨Ålament , which is about the same order of magnitude as monomer size , e . g . , d ‚âà 10nm for actin Ô¨Ålaments . Œ¥(cid:96) , on the other hand , has a strong dependence on the segment rest length (cid:96) 0 ( crosslinking distance ) , Œ¥(cid:96) ‚àº (cid:96) 20 / (cid:96) p . Therefore , we expect the contractile velocity of a crosslinked network to be maximized under an appropriate crosslinking distance . For actin cytoskeleton , for instance , a typical value of the crosslinking distance is (cid:96) 0 ‚âà 1 ¬µ m , corresponding to Œ¥(cid:96) = 6 . 2nm and Àú d = 1 . 6 . Surprisingly , we Ô¨Ånd this Àú d value is very close to the maximum - velocity position , see dashed yellow line in Fig . 4 ( b ) . Such coincidence implies that the crosslinking distance in cytoskeleton may be the result of evolution that optimizes contractility . A . The limit of a viscous substrate Having discussed the microscopic model with a Maxwell substrate , let us switch to a simpler case in which the substrate is viscous , i . e . , the K (cid:29) ‚àÜ E / d 2 limit . Visually , a viscous substrate is obtained by removing the two springs in Fig . 3 ( a ) . In this case , the lengths of the springs y eA and y eB do not appear as variables of the system state , and the total potential energy is W v deÔ¨Åned in Eq . ( 22 ) , with U vb replaced by U b . The survival prob - ability , P v (cid:0) x A , B , y vA , B (cid:1) , is governed by the same FPE of Eq . ( 21 ) , with the initial condition Eq . ( 24 ) . Following the same steps of variable elimination in Eqs . ( 20 - 22 ) , the 4 - variable FPE is reduced to a 1 - variable equation governed by the potential energy W ‚àó ( y B ‚àí y A ) , which has the same form as W v ‚àó ( y vB ‚àí y vA ) in Eq . ( 28 ) , with U vb replaced by U b . As shown in Fig . 4 ( c ) , W ‚àó becomes asymmetric for Ô¨Ånite d , and its shape becomes more asymmetric for small d . In fact , in the small d limit ( d (cid:28) Œ¥(cid:96) ) , W ‚àó has the same form as the polymer PMF U e , because in this limit the microscopic model reduces to the coarse - grained model ( see discus - sion below Eq . ( 31 ) ) . In Fig . 4 ( d ) we numerically calculate the contractile velocity and show its dependence on d . It shows sim - ilar non - monotonically d - dependence as the viscoelastic substrate . This is because the viscoelastic substrate is equivalent to the viscous substrate with a modiÔ¨Åed bind - ing potential , as we point out in Eq . ( 22 ) . We also Ô¨Ånd that the contractile velocity decreases for increasing Àú m y ( or decreasing œâ oÔ¨Ä ) , similar to that in the coarse - grained model ( see Fig . 2 ( c ) ) . V . DISCUSSION We have presented a detailed ( microscopic ) model that demonstrates how contractility can be produced in the absence of molecular motors . Our model considers the details of the binding / unbinding process of one poly - mer on a viscoelastic network , which is assumed to be a Maxwell material . We Ô¨Ånd that contractility naturally results from the active ( un ) binding that violates DB , to - gether with the asymmetric force - extension relation that breaks spatial symmetry . Notably , both of these features are generic for biopolymer networks such as the cytoskele - ton . In our model , the key lengthscale determining the contractile force , is the binding site spacing d . Taking d (cid:39) 10 nm , of order the size of a globular protein or the spacing of binding sites on a cytoskeletal Ô¨Ålament , and Œ¥(cid:96) (cid:39) 6 nm , corresponding to an actin Ô¨Ålament of length 1 ¬µ m , our model predicts a maximum contractile force ‚àº 0 . 5pN . As a comparison , single myosin molecule pro - duces a force ‚àº 3pN [ 45 ] , suggesting that our mechanism generates a weaker but comparable force relative to mo - tors . It is also worth emphasizing that our mechanism is additive in that it can generate such contractility among multiple Ô¨Ålaments even in disordered networks . We have explored various limits of our detailed model . Of special importance are the limits in which the details of the binding process are neglected ( the so - called coarse - grained model ) which greatly simpliÔ¨Åes the calculations and allow for intuitive understanding of the contractile mechanism . Such simpliÔ¨Åcation is valid at d ‚â§ Œ¥(cid:96) , when our coarse - grained model and microscopic model predict similar contractile velocities . However , their predictions diÔ¨Äer when d (cid:29) Œ¥(cid:96) : For the microscopic model there ex - ists an optimal d value and the velocity decreases for d exceeding that optimal value , while for the coarse - grained model the velocity always increases with d . This diÔ¨Äer - ence is due to the large elastic energy when stretching the polymer in the large - d - limit . In the coarse - grained model , the binding process deforms the polymer length with a binding probability , regardless of the energy re - quired for the deformation . In the microscopic model , on the other hand , the deformation of the polymer length is limited by the binding potential , and the change in the elastic energy cannot exceed ‚àÜ E . Therefore , in the large - d - limit the coarse - grained model fails . Similar to molecular motors , a large enough ‚àÜ E is required to gen - erate considerable directional motion [ 18 ] . In our microscopic model , we show that the bind - ing / unbinding on a Maxwell substrate , is equivalent to the binding / unbinding on a viscous substrate with a modiÔ¨Åed binding potential . The reduction naturally orig - inates from the deÔ¨Ånition of the Maxwell material , which is composed of a pure elastic part and a pure viscous part . Since the elastic part responds to external stress immediately , it can always be regarded as a fast vari - 11 able , allowing us to only consider the relaxation of the viscous part . Therefore , this result does not rely on any speciÔ¨Åc assumption , nor is it limited to the particular model considered in this paper . Rather , it can be applied to any binding / unbinding events on Maxwell substrates , whether the binding / unbinding is in or out of equilib - rium . Moreover , the binding site spacing of the modiÔ¨Åed binding potential remains unchanged for any substrate elastic rigidity . Because the binding site spacing is the only parameter associated with the substrate binding po - tential in the coarse - grained limit , when d ‚â§ Œ¥(cid:96) the mi - croscopic model should be reduced to the coarse - grained model with a viscous substrate , regardless of the original substrate elastic rigidity . In this work , we have focused on the Maxwell sub - strate , which behaves as solid at short times and Ô¨Çuid at long times . Another well - known viscoelastic model is the Kelvin - vorgit substrate , which can be applied to our model as well . The Kelvin - vorgit substrate behaves as Ô¨Çuid in short time and solid in long time . Therefore , at short times we expect the Kelvin - Vorgit substrate to de - form in the same way as the viscous substrate that has been discussed in Sec . IV , while at long times the sub - strate stops deformation due to its own elasticity . We choose not to study in detail the Kelvin - Vorgit substrate because most biomaterials , including the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix , are known to Ô¨Çudize at long times [ 46 , 47 ] . Therefore , the Maxwell model is more appropriate for the substrate we have in mind that are formed by biomaterials . However , the Maxwell model does impose an instataneous elastic response of the sub - strate , while in general a viscoelastic material , such as the Burgers model , needs a Ô¨Ånite time to build up its elastic stress . In our model we assume the elastic re - laxation time of the substrate to be much smaller than the unbinding time such that we can consider it to be instataneous . We have only discussed the Maxwell substrate with a single relaxation time for simplicity , however , our mech - anism should also generate contraction in Maxwell sub - strate with multiple relaxation times [ 46 , 48 , 49 ] . Our discussion about the relaxation time ( see Sec . IV ) sug - gests that contractility will be observed as long as there exists one relaxation time that is larger than or compa - rable to the unbinding time . The contractile mechanism proposed in our model re - quires activity that breaks time - reversal symmetry to - gether with a spatial asymmetry that directs the active motion . Such Brownian - ratchet - like mechanism is sim - ilar to the enzymatic cycle of molecular motors , which is fueled by the hydrolysis of ATP [ 18 ] . However , there exists a distinct diÔ¨Äerence between the motor and non - motor mechanisms , which is the origin of the broken spa - tial symmetry . The asymmetry for motors comes from the geometrical polarity of the substrate Ô¨Ålaments they bind to , which directs the motor motion from well de - Ô¨Åned plus ( minus ) end to the other end [ 16 ] . Because the motor motion is not directly related to contractility , it may require a speciÔ¨Åc network architecture to generate contraction [ 50 ] . On the contrary , the non - motor mech - anism in this paper does not rely on substrate polarity . Instead , it relies on the mechanical asymmetry that is generic for any semiÔ¨Çexible biopolymer . In addition to semiÔ¨Çexible polymers , polymers with small persistence length may also possess similar mechanical asymmetry in the opposite limit of semiÔ¨Çexibility , e . g . , DNA [ 28 ] . Such asymmetry leads to a directed motion that is al - ways towards the contractile direction , resulting in con - tractility regardless of network architecture . Moreover , the non - motor mechanism may even generate contractil - ity on apolar Ô¨Ålaments , such as intermediate Ô¨Ålaments , which has not been thought possible . Interestingly , although in this paper we have only considered the mechanical asymmetry on substrate Ô¨Åla - ments , the crosslinking proteins may also be responsible for such asymmetry if they are soft enough , e . g . , Ô¨Ålamin . Contractility has been observed in disordered / apolar actin bundles when the network is crosslinked with Ô¨Ål - amin [ 51 ] , although the active , non - equilibrium aspect of this system is unclear . It is even possible that other ap - olar Ô¨Ålaments like septin may be responsible for force generation , since they play a role in the contractile ring [ 52 , 53 ] . Despite the diÔ¨Äerent origins of spatial asymmetry , the motor and non - motor mechanisms are not mutually ex - clusive . Rather , the non - motor mechanism should be considered as an additional mechanism to the motor mechanism . The non - motor mechanism is able to gen - erate contractility on both polar and apolar substrates . In our model , we have assumed apolar substrates as a worst - case scenario in which motors do not work . How - ever , considering a polar substrate within our model is straightforward , where one should replace the symmetric binding potential in Sec . IV with an asymmetric one , in which case both the motor and non - motor mechanisms can take place simultaneously . In such a case , the non - motor mechanism enhances the contractility of the mo - tor mechanism . The eÔ¨Äects of the two mechanisms may be distinguished from their diÔ¨Äerent Àú d dependence . The motor - driven contractility usually requires the polymer to buckle [ 54 , 55 ] , which only happens when the tension exceeds œÑ 0 . Because œÑ 0 ‚àº Œ¥(cid:96) ‚àí 1 , the motor - driven con - tractility strengthens with decreasing Àú d = d / Œ¥(cid:96) . On the other hand , the contraction of non - motor mechanism , as we have shown for both coarse - grained and microscopic models , increases with increasing Àú d when d ‚â§ Œ¥(cid:96) , which shows opposite Àú d - dependence to motor mechanism . To conclude , our model may provide an explanation for recent observations of non - myosin - dependent dynam - ics of the contractile ring during cell division or cellu - larization [ 13 , 14 ] . It is possible that ATP - dependent crosslinking by myosin in disordered actin networks or 12 other structures may generate contractility [ 8 , 54 , 56 ‚Äì 60 ] , without the need for a motor power stroke . Our model suggests a generic , steady - state mechanism for contrac - tion even in apolar or fully disordered structures .

IV . œÑ r and œÑ hop are two charac - teristic timescales of the modiÔ¨Åed binding potential U vb , whose height is ‚àÜ E v . Since U vb does not have an an - alytical expression , to obtain an estimation of the two timescales we approximate U vb by a triangular potential with height ‚àÜ E v and periodicity d . œÑ r is the time re - quired for the polymer end to relax within one binding site . Let the binding site be within ( ‚àí d / 2 , d / 2 ) and con - sider the diÔ¨Äusion of a particle with mobility m x within a triangular binding potential . We use the ‚Äúintrawell re - laxation time‚Äù introduced in Ref . [ 44 ] to estimate œÑ r . It is deÔ¨Åned as the average mean - Ô¨Årst - passage time of the particle from any Ô¨Åxed initial position x 0 , to a Ô¨Ånal po - sition x that is sampled from a Boltzmann distribution governed by U vb : œÑ r = 1 k B TZm x (cid:90) d / 2 ‚àí d / 2 d x (cid:90) d / 2 x d y (cid:90) d / 2 y d z √ó exp (cid:104) [ ‚àí U vb ( x ) + U vb ( y ) ‚àí U vb ( z ) ] / k B T (cid:105) ‚âà d 2 2 k B Tm x (cid:18) k B T ‚àÜ E v (cid:19) , ( A1 ) where Z = (cid:82) d / 2 ‚àí d / 2 d x exp [ ‚àí U v b ( x ) ] is the partition func - tion . In Eq . ( A1 ) , the integrals over d y and d z calculate the mean - Ô¨Årst - passage time from x 0 to x , and the in - tegral over d x calculates the average mean - Ô¨Årst - passage time with the Boltzmann weight of U vb ( x ) . Note that œÑ r is independent of the initial position x 0 . œÑ hop is the average time for the polymer end to hop to another binding site . The time required to escape from a potential well can be estimated by the mean - Ô¨Årst passage time from the bottom of the well to the top of the well , which is [ 42 ] : œÑ hop = 1 k B Tm x (cid:90) d / 2 0 d y (cid:90) y ‚àí d / 2 d z exp (cid:104) [ U vb ( y ) ‚àí U vb ( z ) ] / k B T (cid:105) ‚âà d 2 2 k B Tm x exp (cid:18) ‚àÜ E v k B T (cid:19) . ( A2 ) We then conclude that for ‚àÜ E v (cid:29) k B T , we have œÑ r (cid:28) œÑ oÔ¨Ä (cid:28) œÑ hop . It can be understood intuitively : in the large ‚àÜ E v limit , the potential well is steep enough thus driv - ing a fast relaxation within the potential well , while the high potential barrier prevents hopping towards another binding site .
