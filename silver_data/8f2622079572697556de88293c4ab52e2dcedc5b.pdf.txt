Social robots are playing an important role in assisting humans in shopping , caring for the elderly and educating children . However , to accomplish these tasks with high quality , social robots still face huge challenges . One of the main challenges is how robots understand the intentions of human behavior and predict human needs in order to respond appropriately . Most existing social robots determine the intentions and needs of humans based on the postures and actions in a specific scene . We know that it is not enough to understand human intentions and needs based on gestures and actions . It will be more perfect to understand human intentions and needs through natural language communication . To this end , we propose a formal framework for describing robots’ understanding of simple and compound concepts . Once the robot has the ability to understand compound concepts , it has the ability to understand some simple knowledge . We first introduce the formal methods of expressing the connotation and extension of simple concepts , and then propose a framework for robots to understand simple concepts , and finally build a formal framework for robots to understand complex concepts . This framework provides a formal method for robots to understand knowledge . 1 . Introduction In the past ten years , the interaction between social robots and humans has made great progress . Especially its outstanding performance in accompany the elderly , assisted education , shopping navigation , catering services , etc . , has attracted great attention from researchers and the industry . How to understand human intentions and needs has become a hot topic in social robot research [ 1 ] . For example , Islam et al . [ 2 ] developed a shopping support robot that can follow customers autonomously . This kind of robot can understand the customer ' s shopping behavior by observing the customer ' s posture , and provide appropriate support without disturbing the customer . Filippini et al . [ 3 ] proposed to improve the educational robot Mio Amico ' s ability to understand children ' s emotions and intentions , and to evaluate children ' s ability to participate in social activities , so as to realize the natural ISSMAS 2021 Journal of Physics : Conference Series 1846 ( 2021 ) 012035 IOP Publishing doi : 10 . 1088 / 1742 - 6596 / 1846 / 1 / 012035 2 interaction between the robot and children . Wächter et al . [ 4 ] proposed a framework that integrates functions such as natural language understanding and task planning , so that the robot can understand natural language and generate task plans based on the actual environment to complete complex tasks . The research aims to improve the ability of robots to communicate and collaborate with humans , so as to apply existing knowledge in new environments to solve problems that have not been encountered before . Kotov et al . [ 5 ] discussed how robots understand problems , and developed a natural text parser with speech understanding for the companion robot . They see the concept of understanding as a compound phenomenon involving the processing of text and the response of the audience . They also believe that emotional representation space is an important aspect of understanding , and process simulation is a shallow model of text understanding . Demir et al . [ 6 ] studied the collaborative performance of a binary search team composed of humans and robots in a simulated Minecraft task environment . The research shows that teams that use natural language and shared mental models perform better than other teams . If the robot can understand natural language to a certain extent , it will help improve the efficiency of cooperation between the robot team and the human team . Eriko et al . [ 7 ] proposed a sensory association method to understand the meaning of metaphorical expressions . When interpreting a noun , this method associates people ' s perception and impression of the noun . Through the application of concept library and large - scale knowledge base association mechanism , the goal of computer understanding metaphor is realized . Zhou et al . [ 8 ] proposed a framework for deep understanding , using syntax tree model to realize image recognition and natural language generation . The framework aims to identify the interaction between people and objects in images and describe the interaction process in natural language . Doboli et al . [ 9 ] proposed a semantic network representation model that includes functions such as reasoning , decision - making , and design . The model includes features , concepts , categories , goals , rewards , and their relationships . It can be used to represent the application of semantic networks in creative activities . In order to discover and understand the user ' s intention in web search queries , Roy et al . [ 10 ] proposed a word classification framework to divide the words in the search query into content and intention . The content word indicates the subject of the query , and the intention word indicates the result that the user wants . Intelligent processing of intention words can provide users with better pages . In order to solve the difficulties of object - based visual classification algorithms , Sheng et al . [ 11 ] proposed a new robot semantic mapping method . This semantic mapping method based on human activity recognition uses semantic information to help robots understand unknown environments . Amaro et al . [ 12 ] proposed a representation method for semantic understanding . This method extracts semantic representations by observing human activities , thereby transferring human skills to humanoid robots . However , the interaction between existing social robots and humans is still in its infancy , its intelligence level is low , and the work it can complete is limited . With the increase of social demand , social robots are facing new challenges in terms of providing higher service quality and more complex tasks . First , robots need more intelligence ; second , robots need to establish a natural and intuitive interactive relationship with humans . To this end , this article explores the question of how robots understand knowledge , and proposes a formal framework for social robots to understand compound concepts in order to improve the robot ' s ability to understand human intentions . This method lays the foundation for the further development of robots to understand more complex knowledge in the future . 2 . Robot ' s understanding of simple concepts 2 . 1 How do robot understand concept Concepts can be divided into simple concepts and compound concepts in structure . In constructing a formal framework for robot understanding concepts , it is necessary to determine some of the most basic simple concepts as the basis , and then expand into composite concepts . These simple concepts as the basis are not further decomposed in the formal representation , so they are also called atomic concepts . Descriptive logic has a relatively complete theoretical system for the formal representation of concepts [ 13 ] , which will not be introduced here . This article focuses on how to build a formal ISSMAS 2021 Journal of Physics : Conference Series 1846 ( 2021 ) 012035 IOP Publishing doi : 10 . 1088 / 1742 - 6596 / 1846 / 1 / 012035 3 framework that describes the robot ' s understanding of simple and compound concepts . Because the concept is a basic component of knowledge , we must understand the concept from the level of understanding knowledge , instead of separate the concept for discussion . Knowledge understanding can be divided into four levels from primary level to advanced level : ( 1 ) Retelling understanding , that is , being able to describe knowledge literally ; ( 2 ) interpretative understanding , that is , being able to analyze and summarize the internal relations of knowledge ; ( 3 ) critical understanding , that is , being able to comment on knowledge ; ( 4 ) creative understanding , that is , being able to innovate knowledge . Considering that there is a big gap between human and robot in understanding the innate conditions of knowledge , this paper only discusses the concept of robot understanding at the level of retelling understanding and explanatory understanding . At present , there is not much progress in the research on how robots understand concepts . There is neither a recognized definition nor a specific framework or model for how to verify whether a robot understands a certain concept . Therefore , how to explain that the robot understands a certain outline is the core issue we need to pay attention to . In fact , when humans describe a concept of how to understand , they also have different views and different expressions . However , the concept has two basic characteristics that everyone recognizes , namely connotation and extension . Connotation refers to the meaning of a concept , that is , the unique attributes of the things or objects reflected by the concept . Extension refers to things or objects that have the attributes reflected by the concept . Therefore , to understand a concept , you must understand its connotation and extension . This is the most basic requirement for understanding the concept . This article proposes three conditions to determine whether a robot can understand a concept : Condition 1 : The robot knows the connotation of the given concept , that is , the robot knows what the essential attributes of the given concept are . Specifically , the robot can query the essential attributes of a given concept in its own knowledge base . These essential attributes can be stored in the knowledge base of the robot in advance by the designer , or obtained by the robot through learning . When the robot finds the essential attributes of the concept and can retell the content in a certain language , we say that the robot has the ability to retell the concept . Condition 2 : The robot knows the extension of a given concept , that is , the robot knows which objects are within the scope of the given concept . In other words , the robot has the ability to judge whether an object is within the scope of a given concept . This task can be accomplished by a computer vision system or other recognition system installed on the robot . Condition 3 : The robot knows the function of a given concept , that is , the robot can use the connotation and extension function of the given concept to solve related problems or complete related tasks . For example , if the robot understands the concept of " cup " , then when the owner says he wants to drink water , the robot knows to get the cup and then to fill the water . Conversely , when the owner says he wants a cup , the robot knows that the owner wants to use the cup to hold water , drinks , wine and other liquids . The above three conditions are considered to be that the robot has a preliminary understanding of the given concept . 2 . 2 Framework for robots to understand simple concepts We build a framework for robots to understand simple concepts based on first order logic ( FOL ) . Some commonly used symbols and their meanings are the same as those in FOL or description logic ( DL ) . Since robots need to have certain cognitive abilities in the process of understanding conceptual attributes , we give robots some simple cognitive abilities . The purpose and meaning of several concepts and symbols commonly used in this article are explained as follows :  Simple concepts : basic concepts used to construct other composite concepts , usually expressed by P , Q . ISSMAS 2021 Journal of Physics : Conference Series 1846 ( 2021 ) 012035 IOP Publishing doi : 10 . 1088 / 1742 - 6596 / 1846 / 1 / 012035 4  The domain of concept P : the value range of the extension of P ( that is , the object described by the concept ) , represented by D .  The connotation of the concept P : describe the essential attributes of the concept , expressed by Con ( P ) . In the formal description , Con ( P ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐴 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐴 (cid:3041) } or Con ( P ) = 𝐴 (cid:2869) ∧ 𝐴 (cid:2870) ∧ ⋯ ∧ 𝐴 (cid:3041) , where the formulas 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐴 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐴 (cid:3041) represent all essential attributes of p .  The extension of the concept P : the object described by the connotation of the concept P , expressed by Ext ( P ) . In the formal description , Ext ( P ) = { x | x ∈ D and x has all the attributes of P } . Definition 2 . 1 Suppose A is a formula in FOL , R is a robot , and KB is R ' s knowledge base , then R knows A if and only if A is in KB . Symbolized as : Know ( R , A ) ⟺ A ∈ KB . ( 1 ) Among them , Know ( R , A ) means that the robot R knows A . Definition 2 . 1 means that the robot knows and only knows the knowledge in its knowledge base . Definition 2 . 2 Let the predicate formula P represent a simple concept , and Con ( P ) represents the connotation of P . If Con ( P ) ⊆ KB , the robot R is said to know the connotation of the concept p , denoted as Know ( R , Con ( P ) ) . An equivalent of Definition 2 . 2 is that if the robot R knows all the essential properties of the concept P , then R knows the connotation of P . vice versa . In discussing the concept of robot understanding , we assume that the robot is equipped with multi - functional sensors that can recognize all objects related to the task in the robot environment . Definition 2 . 3 Suppose P represents a simple concept , and Ext ( P ) represents the extension of concept P , and D represents a universe of discourse ; if R can identify whether d is the extension of P for any element d in D , then R knows The extension of P , denoted as know Know ( R , Ext ( P ) ) . Definition 2 . 3 shows that if the robot can distinguish which elements in the domain D meet the conditions described by a given concept and which do not , then it can be considered that the robot knows the extension of the concept . Definition 2 . 4 Suppose P represents a simple concept , and R is a robot , then R understands P if and only if R knows the connotation of P and the extension of P , which is represented by the symbol Und ( R , P ) ⟺ Know ( R , Con ( P ) ) ∧ Know ( R , Ext ( P ) ) ( 2 ) 3 . Robot ' s understanding of compound concepts In the previous section , we proposed a formal framework for describing simple concepts that robots understand . Next , we discuss how the robot understands compound concepts . Compound concepts are constructed on the basis of simple concepts , including " conjunctive concepts of connotation " and " negative concepts " . The composition of compound concepts is more complicated than the composition of compound propositions . Any two propositional formulas can constitute a legal propositional conjunction . However , we cannot combine any two attributes into a meaningful concept . For example , " high foot glass with handle " is a meaningful compound concept . " Low alcohol red wine " is also a meaningful compound concept . But " red wine with handle " is a meaningless concept . Generally speaking , we only discuss the concept of compound in a certain scope . For example , within the scope of the extension of the cup , we discuss the composite concepts of " high foot glass with handle " and " blue plastic cup without handle " . Strictly speaking , we discuss the compound of subordinate concepts within the scope of the superordinate concept , and each sub - component concept in the compound concept has the same domain . For example , let P denote " low alcohol wine " and Q denote " red wine " , then we have that P and Q both are simple concepts , and P ∧ Q is a compound concept , which means " low alcohol red wine " . Definition 3 . 1 Suppose that P and Q are two simple concepts . On the basis of their common superordinate concept , the connotation attributes of these two concepts are combined to form a composite concept , which is called the conjunction concept of P and Q , and denoted as P ∧ Q . For example , let P denote " low alcohol wine " and Q denote " red wine " , we have that P and Q are simple concepts , and P ∧ Q is a compound concept which means " low alcohol red wine " . Theorem 1 Let P and Q be two simple concepts , and R is a robot , if Und ( R , P ) and Und ( R , Q ) , ISSMAS 2021 Journal of Physics : Conference Series 1846 ( 2021 ) 012035 IOP Publishing doi : 10 . 1088 / 1742 - 6596 / 1846 / 1 / 012035 5 then Und ( R , P ∧ Q ) . Proof : Assuming Und ( R , P ) and Und ( R , Q ) . By definition 2 . 4 , we have Know ( R , Con ( P ) ) ∧ Know ( R , Ext ( P ) ) and Know ( R , Con ( Q ) ) ∧ Know ( R , Ext ( Q ) ) 。 a ) We first prove Know ( R , Con ( P ∧ Q ) ) . Let Con ( P ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } , Con ( Q ) = { 𝐵 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } , Where { 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } is the essential attribute of the superordinate concept of P and Q , that is also the common essential attributes of the two , 𝐴 (cid:2869) is the unique essential attribute of P , and 𝐵 (cid:2869) is the unique essential attribute of Q . By definition 2 . 2 , Con ( P ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } ⊆ KB , and Con ( Q ) = { 𝐵 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } ⊆ KB , then we have Con ( P ∧ Q ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐵 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } ⊆ KB . Again by definition 2 . 2 , we have Know ( R , Con ( P ∧ Q ) ) . b ) Then prove Know ( R , Ext ( P ∧ Q ) ) . Because Con ( P ∧ Q ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐵 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } , Ext ( P ∧ Q ) = Ext ( P ) ∩ Ext ( Q ) ⊆ Ext ( P ) . From Know ( R , Ext ( P ) ) and definition 2 . 3 , we have Know ( R , Ext ( P ∧ Q ) ) . According to definition 2 . 4 , we have Und ( R , P ∧ Q ) . Next , we will discuss negative concepts . In general , we use positive statements to describe simple concepts , and use a negative word together with simple concepts to represent negative concepts . Definition 3 . 2 If a positive statement is used to describe the connotation of a concept , the concept is called a positive concept ; and a negative statement is used to describe the connotation of a concept , then the concept is called a negative concept . The formal representation of negative concepts is more complicated . In FOL , usually a negative word " not " is added in front of a proposition symbol to indicate the negation of the proposition . For example , suppose the formula P means " c is a plastic cup " , then (cid:3411) P means " c is not a plastic cup " . From the meaning of (cid:3411) P , as long as c is not a plastic cup , (cid:3411) P is considered true . For example , if c is a glass or c is a saucer , then (cid:3411) P is true . But when discussing the formalization of negative concepts , simply adding a negative word in front of the positive concepts cannot fully express the meaning of the negative concepts . For example , " plastic cup " is a positive concept , and " non - plastic cup " is a negative concept . The essential attributes of " plastic cups " are " cup " and " plastic products " , while the essential attributes of " non - plastic cups " are " cup " and " not plastic products " . It is easy to see that both the positive concept " plastic cup " and the negative " non - plastic cup " contain the essential attribute " cup " , and the negative concept " non - plastic cup " only negates the attribute " plastic product " , but does not negate the attribute " cup " . Therefore , when formalizing negative concepts , we should clearly indicate which attribute the negative words in negative concepts negate . Definition 3 . 3 Suppose P is a simple concept , Con ( P ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } , where { 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } is the essential attribute of the superordinate concept of P , and 𝐴 (cid:2869) is the unique essential attribute of P . The negative concept of P is represented by (cid:3411) P , which refers to the things that do not have the attributes of 𝐴 (cid:2869) in the superordinate concept of P . That is , Con ( (cid:3411) P ) = { 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } - { 𝐴 (cid:2869) } ， Ext ( (cid:3411) P ) = D - Ext ( P ) . For example , suppose P stands for " plastic cup " and (cid:3411) P stands for " non - plastic cup " . Con ( P ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } , where 𝐴 (cid:2869) represents " plastic products " , { 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } represents the essential properties of " cup " , then the extension of P is the set of all plastic cups , and the extension of (cid:3411) P is the set of all cups that are not made of plastic . Theorem 2 Let P be a simple concept , R is a robot . If Und ( R , P ) , Und ( R , (cid:3411) P ) . Proof : Assuming Und ( R , P ) , by definition 2 . 5 , we have Know ( R , Con ( P ) ) ∧ Know ( R , Ext ( P ) ) ∧ Know ( R , Fun ( P ) ) . Let Con ( P ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } , Con ( (cid:3411) P ) = { 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } - { 𝐴 (cid:2869) } , where { 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } is the essential attribute of the superordinate concept of P , and 𝐴 (cid:2869) is the unique essential attribute of P . By definition 2 . 2 , Con ( P ) = { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } ⊆ KB . Thus Con ( (cid:3411) P ) = { 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } - { 𝐴 (cid:2869) } ⊆ KB . Again by definition 2 . 2 , we have Know ( R , Con ( (cid:3411) P ) ) . On the other hand , according to Know ( R , Ext ( P ) ) and definition 2 . 3 , the robot R can recognize the attributes { 𝐴 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } of P . by definition 3 . 3 it is deduced that R can recognize the attributes { 𝐶 (cid:2869) , 𝐶 (cid:2870) , ⋯ , 𝐶 (cid:3041) } - { 𝐴 (cid:2869) } of (cid:3411) P . So we have Know ( R , Ext ( (cid:3411) P ) ) . According to definition 2 . 4 , we have Und ( R , (cid:3411) P ) .
