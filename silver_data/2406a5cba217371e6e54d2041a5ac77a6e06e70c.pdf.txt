The cell membrane adheres to the particle ( nanoparticle or virus ) and then wraps it to form a vesicle delivered to the cytosol . Previous ﬁndings identiﬁed a minimum radius for a spherical particle below which endocytosis cannot occur . This is due to the insuﬃcient driving force , from receptor - ligand aﬃnity , to overcome the energy barrier created by membrane bending . In this paper , we extend this result to the case of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which is the most common pathway for virus entry . Moreover , we investigate the eﬀect of ligand inhibitors on the particle surface , motivated by viral an - tibodies , peptides or phage capsids nanoparticles . We determine the necessary conditions for endocytosis by considering the additional energy barrier due to the membrane bending to wrap such inhibiting protrusions . We ﬁnd that the density and size of inhibitors determine the size range of internalized particles , and endo - cytosis is completely blocked above critical thresholds . The assembly of a clathrin coat with a spontaneous curvature increases the energy barrier and sets a maximum particle size ( in agreement with experimental observations on smooth particles ) . Our investigation suggests that morphological considerations can inform the optimal design of neutralizing viral antibodies and new strategies for targeted nanomedicine . Keywords : Receptor - mediated endocytosis , cell adhesion , virus , antibody , biomembrane , obstacle problem , ligand inhibitor , clathrin coat Introduction Endocytosis is a fundamental process by which cells uptake external particles . This can occur through diﬀerent pathways ( Yi et al . , 2014 ) . One observed mechanism exploits the binding aﬃnity between cell receptors and particle ligands , leading the cell membrane to wrap the whole particle into a delivery vesicle . Another mechanism involves proteins - present in the cytoplasm - which form a coated vesicle having spontaneous curvature , thereby facilitating the internalization of particles with selected size ( Mashl and Bruinsma , 1998 ) . Cells commonly use endocytosis to internalize nutrients , but the process can also result in undesired viral entry and hence the infection of the cell . A physical description of endocytosis is thus crucial for understanding nutrient uptake , viral infection , and nanoparticle engineering for diagnostics and targeted therapies requiring a selective uptake . Receptor - mediated endocytosis depends on particle size and geometry , biochemistry , and mechanics ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . Previous studies considered simple particle shapes such as spheres and cylinders , and showed that endocytosis requires the particle to be larger than a minimum size ( Gao et al . , 2005 ; Yi et al . , 2014 ; Yi and Gao , 2017 ) . However , these results neglected the role of coating proteins such as clathrin and caveolin , despite the fact that clahtrin - mediated endocytosis is the most common entry process ∗ Corresponding author .

Moreover , the eﬀect of inhibiting protrusions on endocytosis remains largely unexplored . In particular , it is unknown how ligand inhibitors quantitatively aﬀect particle uptake by their twofold action of reducing the ligand density and modifying the particle morphology . We consider a spherical and rigid particle having a fraction of ligands blocked by ﬁnite - sized inhibitors that protrude out of the spherical surface . The inhibitors represent neutralizing antibodies , peptides , or phage capsids attaching to the surface of the particle to cover ( neutralize ) a fraction of ligands ( Flint et al . , 2015 ; Lauster et al . , 2020 ) . The physical scale of the inhibitors adds an additional geometric consideration for the successful encapsulation of the particle . We focus on the spontaneity of the wrapping process initiating endocytosis and explore the geometric determinants of the complex morphology obtained . The number and size of protrusions raise the energetic barrier for endocytosis based on particle size and inhibitor spacing due to both the reduction of ligand - receptor bindings and the additional bending penalty to wrap the inhibitors . Fig . 1 illustrates the concept of inhibiting protrusions that block the particle entry . Figure 1 : Schematic illustration of the process of receptor - mediated endocytosis , including the case of clathrin coating . The presence of ligand inhibitors on the surface of a spherical particle can prevent cell entry , depending on the size and number of the inhibitors . To reduce the number of variables , we assume the cell radius R c to be much larger than that of the particle R p ( inﬁnite and ﬂat cell membrane ) . Building on the mechanical model for the uptake of a rigid sphere ( Gao et al . , 2005 ) , we account for the diﬀusivity of cell receptors across the cell membrane and the free energy of the membrane as the sum of elastic deformation energy and adhesion energy . The spontaneity of endocytosis is determined by imposing that the rate of free energy reduction , due to membrane wrapping , equals the rate of free energy dissipation due to receptor transport . We account for the reduced ligand density due to the presence of inhibitors and calculate the equilibrium conﬁguration of the membrane wrapping around the particle and its protrusions . We ﬁnd that size , indentation , and density of ligand inhibitors determine the selective uptake of particles , and the entry is completely blocked above critical thresholds . In particular , when endocytosis is independent of protein coats , particles can enter the cell only if their radius is larger than a minimum value , while for the clathrin - mediated endocytosis , particles are selected within a size range , consistently with experiments on spherical particles ( Rejman et al . , 2004 ) . The proposed results provide a foundation for the design of viral antibodies , peptides , and capsids acting as physical and geometrical inhibitors , and for the design of targeted nanoparticles undergoing selective cell entry based on the interplay between morphology and receptor density . 2 Theory Particle geometry We consider a spherical particle of radius R p with ligands uniformly distributed on its surface with a density ξ L . We estimate the spacing between two adjacent ligands ∼ 1 / √ ξ L by assuming an ideal tessellation of the sphere consisting of a large number of hexagons and 12 pentagons ( such as in Goldberg polyhedrons ) , see Appendix A . We denote by R the curvature radius of the membrane that wraps the spherical particle , thus including the particle radius R p , the receptor - ligand bond , and half thickness of the lipid bilayer ( 1 . 5 − 2 . 5 nm , Lewis and Engelman ( 1983 ) ) , see Fig . 2a . In the following we refer to R as the particle radius . The wrapping process requires cell receptors to diﬀuse towards the contact region so that the receptor density on the cell surface approximates the ligand density on the particle surface , ξ L . We cover a fraction p of ligands with spherical inhibitors of radius r , which we assume uniformly dis - tributed on the particle . Such inhibitors protrude over the particle surface a length δ ( see Fig . 2b ) , which we express as a multiple of the inhibitor radius r , i . e . , δ : = 2 dr where d is a dimensionless indentation parameter . Figure 2 : Two - dimensional schematic illustration of the cell membrane S that wraps an external particle during receptor - mediated endocytosis . ( a ) Spherical particle of radius R p with ligand surface density ξ L , so that the spacing between two adjacent ligands is approximately 1 / √ ξ L , see Appendix A . The cell membrane develops a curvature of radius R , which includes both the particle and the receptor - ligand bonds . S w denotes the portion of the cell membrane in contact with the particle , which corresponds to a wrapping angle β w . S pw is the projection of S w onto the ﬂat membrane . ( b ) A fraction p of ligands are inhibited by spherical protrusions of radius r . Inhibitors protrude a length δ , and S p denotes the representative portion of cell membrane that wraps a single protrusion , assuming protrusions are largely spaced . When the cell membrane wraps the particle , including its protrusions , the receptors diﬀuse toward the wrapping region to bind to the particle ligands that are still active . The surface density of eﬀective ligands is reduced to ( 1 − p ) ξ L , while the membrane will need additional area and bending to wrap around the protrusions . The surface density of receptors in the wrapped membrane is ξ p : = ( 1 − p ) α p ξ L ( 1 ) where α p : = A tot / A s is the dimensionless ratio between the surface area of the membrane wrapping the whole particle with inhibiting protrusions , A tot , and the surface area of the spherical particle , A s = 4 πR 2 . α p ≥ 1 measures the excess area needed for wrapping that is due to the inhibitors , with α p = 1 when p = 0 ( no protrusions ) . The parameter p deﬁnes the fraction of inhibited ligands and we assume that there is a maximum value p max ≈ 1 / π , for which the wrapping process is still possible in a symmetric fashion . Indeed , above this threshold value , the number of inhibitors is so large that there must be at least two adjacent inhibitors , so that we cannot assume that the membrane wraps any protrusion by binding to the surrounding ligands , see Appendix B . 3 Free energy of the cell membrane and protein coat We consider a membrane S with an initially uniform receptor density ξ 0 , which curves to wrap a proximal particle , as cell receptors bind to particle ligands . We assume the membrane to be inﬁnitely extended and initially ﬂat , i . e . the particle radius R p is much smaller than the cell radius R c , namely , R p / R c (cid:28) 1 ( see Fig . 1 ) . Since endocytosis is often mediated by proteins - such as clathrin and caveolin - that form coated pits ( Flint et al . , 2015 ) , we include a protein coat with a spontaneous mean curvature H (cid:63) , which assembles during the wrapping process and attaches to the membrane in the contact region . The free energy of the cell membrane is given by the contributions from elastic deformation E el and adhesion E ad , namely , E = E el + E ad . We describe E el with the Canham - Helfrich model ( Canham , 1970 ; Helfrich , 1973 ) and neglect deformations of the cell membrane outside the contact region S w , such that E el = (cid:90) S w (cid:104) 2 κ c ( H − H (cid:63) ) 2 + ˜ κ c K (cid:105) d A + (cid:90) S w 2 κ m H 2 d A + σ ∆ A . ( 2 ) In Eq . ( 2 ) , the ﬁrst integral term provides the elastic energy of the protein coat ( denoted by the subscript c ) , whereas the other two terms provide the elastic energy of the cell membrane ( denoted by the subscript m ) . The bending energy is expressed in terms of the mean and Gaussian curvatures , respectively H and K , with the corresponding elastic moduli κ and ˜ κ . The Gaussian curvature accounts for the energy stored in symmetric saddles with zero mean curvature . In view of the Gauss - Bonnet theorem , its integral over the surface reduces to the sum of a topological invariant and the integral of the geodesic curvature of the surface boundary ; we neglect this term ( a constant ) for the inﬁnite membrane and we consider it only for the protein coat , whose boundary evolves during wrapping . For simplicity , we assume that the spontaneous mean curvature of the protein coat , H (cid:63) , is constant even though recent experimental and theoretical evidence supports a ﬂat - to - curved transition during the assembly of clathrin pits ( Frey , 2019 ) . Moreover , we consider that both the membrane and the coat have the same conﬁguration ( i . e . , curvatures ) . This hypothesis implies that we neglect the coat thickness , which is about 5 nm for caveolin ( Stoeber et al . , 2016 ) , and 20 − 30 nm for clathrin ( Vigers et al . , 1986 ; Pedersen , 1993 ) . The last term in Eq . ( 2 ) describes the mechanical work due to membrane stretching , i . e . the product of surface tension σ to the excess area ∆ A = A w − A pw . A w is the area of the wrapping surface S w , and A pw is the area of the corresponding projection S pw on the ﬂat conﬁguration ( Deserno , 2004 ) , see Fig . 2 . The adhesion energy E ad accounts for entropic , E r , and enthalpic , E h , contributions ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . The conﬁgurational , entropic , energy of receptors ( in analogy with an ideal gas , Freund and Lin ( 2004 ) ) is E r = k B T (cid:90) S ξ ln ξ ξ 0 d A ( 3 ) where k B is the Boltzmann constant , T is the absolute temperature , ξ is the number of receptors per unit area of the cell membrane , and ξ 0 is the uniform receptor density in an isolated cell , or at inﬁnite distance from the wrapping site . The change of enthalpy , due to the formation of coated pits and the receptor - ligand binding ( Gao et al . , 2005 ) , provides the driving force for the wrapping process and is given by E h = − (cid:90) S w ( ξe RL + ξ c e c ) d A . ( 4 ) Here e RL is the receptor - ligand binding energy , ξ c is the surface density of coating protein bonds , and e c is the protein binding energy . Let us now divide each energetic contribution by k B T , and each length by the ligand spacing (cid:96) ≈ 1 / √ ξ L . The dimensionless free energy is then ¯ E = (cid:90) S w (cid:104) 2¯ κ m ¯ H 2 + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) ¯ H − ¯ H (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c ¯ K (cid:105) d ¯ A + ¯ σ ∆ ¯ A − (cid:90) S w (cid:0) ¯ ξ ¯ e RL + ¯ ξ c ¯ e c (cid:1) d ¯ A + (cid:90) S ¯ ξ ln (cid:0) ¯ ξ / ¯ ξ 0 (cid:1) d ¯ A ( 5 ) 4 where ¯ E : = E / ( k B T ) , ¯ κ i : = κ i / ( k B T ) for i = c , m , ¯ H : = H / √ ξ L , ¯ H (cid:63) : = H (cid:63) / √ ξ L , ¯˜ κ c : = ˜ κ c / ( k B T ) , ¯ K : = K / ξ L , ¯ ξ : = ξ / ξ L , ¯ e RL : = e RL / ( k B T ) , ¯ ξ c : = ξ c / ξ L , ¯ e c : = e c / ( k B T ) , ¯ A : = ξ L A , and ¯ σ : = σ / ( k B Tξ L ) . In Table 1 we report the physical quantities adopted in our model , taken from literature . In clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the self - assembling coat controls the equilibrium conﬁguration of the bilayer - composed of membrane and coat - wrapped around the protrusion . This is due to the higher bending rigidity of the coat ( ¯ κ c > ¯ κ m ) , as shown in Table 1 . If either the coat is absent or the membrane accommodates to the spontaneous curvature of the coat , then the elastic term is dominated by the cost of bending the cell membrane , since its rigidity , ¯ κ m , is one order of magnitude larger than its tension , ¯ σ , see Table 1 . The adhesion energy is of the same order of magnitude of the elastic energy , with the enthalpic term dominating over the entropic one . Indeed , in the wrapping region , ¯ ξ ≈ 1 is one order of magnitude smaller than the binding energies ¯ e RL and ¯ e c . From this analysis we observe that the process is primarily led by an exchange of enthalpic ( binding ) energy , ¯ E h , with elastic ( wrapping ) energy , ¯ E el .

( 2015 ) ¯ H (cid:63) = − 0 . 283 In comparison with a spherical particle , the presence of protrusions hinders the process of endocytosis by increasing the energetic cost of wrapping . Each protrusion raises E el by increasing membrane curvature locally . Protrusions also aﬀect the adhesion energy E ad by reducing the enthalpic gain and the entropic cost , due to the loss of a fraction p of receptors in the wrapped region . This can be seen from ξ p < ξ L 5 in Eq . ( 1 ) and the last two terms of Eq . ( 5 ) . The reduced cost favors endocytosis , but is lower than the reduced gain , which ﬁnally provides an additional barrier to particle uptake . In the following section we provide quantitative evidence of this scaling argument . Condition for endocytosis Spherical particle We assume that cell receptors are mobile and diﬀuse towards the contact site to bind to ( immobile ) particle ligands . We assume that receptors are uniformly distributed with a surface density ξ 0 at remote distances from the binding site . They accumulate in the contact region to match the surface density of ligands , ξ L > ξ 0 . This yields a depletion of receptors in the outer proximity of the contact front , which determines a concentration gradient that drives the global diﬀusion towards the binding site ( Freund and Lin , 2004 ; Gao et al . , 2005 ) . We describe the nonuniform receptor density outside the contact region with the function ξ ( ρ , t ) , where ρ is the radial coordinate and t is time . We denote by ρ 0 ( t ) the radial coordinate of the moving contact front , which is given by ρ 0 ( t ) = R sin β w ( t ) , where β w ( t ) is the angle that corresponds to the surface area A w ( t ) of the portion of the cell membrane that wraps the particle , S w ( t ) ( see Fig . 2a ) . During the wrapping process , receptors are driven by a local reduction in the free energy , which rate of change is ˙ E ( t ) = − ˙ A w ( t ) (cid:26) ξ L e RL + ξ c e c − k B Tξ L (cid:18) ln ξ L ξ 0 + ln ξ 0 ξ + − 1 + cos β w ξ + ξ L (cid:19) − 1 R 2 (cid:104) 2 κ m + 2 κ c ( 1 − R / R (cid:63) ) 2 + ˜ κ c (cid:105) − k B T ( 1 − cos β w ) σ (cid:27) − 2 πDk B T (cid:90) + ∞ ρ 0 ( t ) ξ (cid:18) ∂ ln ξ ∂ρ (cid:19) 2 ρ d ρ ( 6 ) as explained in Appendix C with p = 0 . Here a superposed dot denotes time diﬀerentiation , D is the diﬀusivity of cell receptors , R (cid:63) is the preferred radius of curvature of the protein coat , and ξ + : = lim ρ → ρ + 0 ξ ( ρ ) is the receptor density in the unwrapped region next to the binding site ρ + 0 , giving ξ + < ξ 0 ( Freund and Lin , 2004 ) . The integral term in Eq . ( 6 ) is the rate of energy dissipation due to receptor transport ( Freund and Lin , 2004 ) . The expression within { . . . } describes the rate of free energy change per unit of new wrapping membrane . The ﬁrst two terms represent the reduction of enthalpy ( receptor - ligand bindings and coat assembling ) . The expression within ( . . . ) , and multiplied by ξ L , accounts for the entropic change : the ﬁrst two terms describe the relocation of receptors from the uniform density ξ 0 to ξ L , within the wrapped region , and ξ + , outside that region ; the other two terms describe the receptor transport across the front , from ξ + to ξ L , where ξ + is multiplied by cos β w to account for the diﬀerence between the spherical area and its planar projection . The terms within [ . . . ] deﬁne the free energy increment required to deform elastically the membrane and the protein coat . Finally , the term multiplied by σ accounts for the membrane tension , which increases with the wrapping angle β w . Particle wrapping can occur only if the free energy is released at a rate greater than or equal to the rate of energy dissipated by the cell receptor transport across the membrane ( Freund and Lin , 2004 ) . From this , we determine the necessary condition for initiating particle wrapping via Eq . ( 6 ) , by approximating the density ξ + with the initial density ξ 0 , and by setting β w = 0 , giving (cid:0) ¯ e RL + ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + 1 − ¯ ξ 0 + ln ¯ ξ 0 (cid:1) ¯ R 2 ≥ 2¯ κ m + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) 1 − ¯ R / ¯ R (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c ( 7 ) with ¯ R (cid:63) : = R (cid:63) √ ξ L . If we neglect the protein coat , Eq . ( 7 ) reduces to the condition found by Gao et al . ( 2005 ) . In this case , if the expression within the parenthesis on the left side is positive - i . e . , the enthalpic gain is higher than the entropic cost - the inequality is satisﬁed for any value of the dimensionless radius larger than a threshold , ¯ R ≥ ¯ R min . By ﬁxing the value of the ligand density , this translates to the existence of a minimum radius R min for the particle uptake . For protein - independent receptor - mediated endocytosis and for relevant biological values of the parameters ( see Table 1 ) , the minimum radius is R min ≈ 24 nm , which is in agreement with experimental observations ( Gao et al . , 2005 ) . 6 In the presence of a protein coat , the same holds true for values of the preferred radius of curvature that are higher than a threshold ( ¯ R (cid:63) > ¯ R (cid:63) 0 ) , such that for particles that are large enough , the driving force is suﬃcient to overcome the penalty for deviating from ¯ R (cid:63) . However , for higher values of the spontaneous curvature of the protein coat ( ¯ R (cid:63) < ¯ R (cid:63) 0 ) , the cost of deviating from the preferred conﬁguration is increasing faster than the driving force , for particles of increasing radii . This implies also an upper bound on the dimensionless radius , ¯ R max . In other terms , if the protein coat has a preferred radius smaller than ¯ R (cid:63) 0 , the cost of bending dominates over adhesion and becomes prohibitive for radii larger than a maximum value . In this case , the wrapping is favorable only for particles within a speciﬁc size range , ¯ R ∈ (cid:2) ¯ R min , ¯ R max (cid:3) , see Appendix D . For relevant values of the biological parameters for clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( see Table 1 ) , the critical preferred radius is R (cid:63) 0 ≈ 78 . 76 nm ( R (cid:63) 0 ≈ 81 . 57 nm ) for ¯ ξ 0 = 0 . 1 ( ¯ ξ 0 = 0 . 025 ) , cf . Appendix D . Thus , by assuming a preferred radius of curvature R (cid:63) = 50 nm , we predict the uptake of particles of radius between R min ≈ 33 nm ( R min ≈ 34 nm ) and R max ≈ 134 nm ( R max ≈ 126 nm ) for ¯ ξ 0 = 0 . 1 ( ¯ ξ 0 = 0 . 025 ) . This theoretical conclusion is in good agreement with experimental observations about the size dependence of clathrin - mediated endocytosis that exhibited an upper radius limit for internalization of approximately 100 nm ( Rejman et al . , 2004 ) . Spherical particle with protruding inhibitors We adapt the argument sketched above for the spherical particle , by splitting the cell membrane into regions that wrap a single protrusion and the rest that adheres to the spherical part of the particle , see Fig . 2b . As shown in Appendix C , we arrive at the inequality ( 1 − p ) ξ L e RL + α p ξ c e c + k B Tξ L (cid:20) ( 1 − p ) − ξ 0 ξ L + ( 1 − p ) ln (cid:18) α p 1 − p ξ 0 ξ L (cid:19)(cid:21) ≥ k B T ( α p − 1 ) σ + (cid:18) 1 − p p max (cid:19) (cid:34) 2 κ m + 2 κ c (cid:18) 1 − R R (cid:63) (cid:19) 2 + ˜ κ c (cid:35) 1 R 2 + p ξ L (cid:90) S p (cid:104) 2 κ m H 2 + 2 κ c ( H − H (cid:63) ) 2 + ˜ κ c K (cid:105) d A , ( 8 ) where 1 / p max = 2 π ¯ R 2 (cid:0) 1 − cos 1 / ¯ R (cid:1) , see Appendix B . Eq . ( 8 ) provides a necessary condition for the initiation of wrapping for a particle with inhibiting protrusions , and reduces to Eq . ( 7 ) for p = 0 . Figure 3 : ( a ) Three - dimensional and ( b ) two - dimensional views of cell membrane clamped to the particle at the boundary and wrapping the ligand inhibitor . Both the radial coordinate ¯ ρ , and the height function ¯ h are measured in units of the ligand spacing (cid:96) ≈ 1 / √ ξ L . We determined the conﬁguration as an axisymmetric solution to the obstacle problem where the obstacle is deﬁned as half capsule ( yellow dashed line ) , for model parameters (cid:96) ≈ 14 nm , ¯ r : = r √ ξ L = 0 . 3 , ¯ R = 10 , d = 1 , ¯ κ m = 20 , ¯ κ c = ¯˜ κ c = ¯ H (cid:63) = 0 , see Appendix E . To solve Eq . ( 8 ) we need to obtain the equilibrium conﬁguration of the membrane in the region that wraps a protruding inhibitor , S p . This reduces to the solution of an obstacle problem that implicitly depends on the geometry of the particle , namely , r ( protrusion radius ) , R , and δ ( indentation ) , see Fig . 2b . The equilibrium conﬁguration is the one that minimizes the elastic deformation energy , E el , while satisfying compatibility 7 with the protrusion and adhered to the particle at the boundary , due to the surrounding receptor - ligand bonds . This requires the solution of a nonlinear variational inequality , which we approximate numerically , since analytical results are unavailable . In this study we used the ﬁnite element method to minimize the elastic energy with a penalty term that enforces the obstacle constraint , described as a half spherocylinder in the Monge parametrization , see Appendix E and Fig . 3 . In this analysis , we assumed that the membrane wraps the protrusions and binds to the closest eﬀective ligands . This hypothesis is realistic for small p and small r , where a single - spaced conﬁguration is energet - ically favorable . In fact , for larger r , a doubled - spaced conﬁguration is favored over the single - spaced one ( see Appendix F ) . Results By solving for the equality in Eq . ( 8 ) in the parameter space ( p , ¯ R ) we determine the regions where endocytosis is favorable , using the parameters reported in Table 1 . Fig . 4a shows the results in the absence of clathrin coat , whereas , Fig . 4b shows the results in the presence of the coat . Figure 4 : Regions of favorable endocytosis in the parameter space (cid:0) p , ¯ R (cid:1) where p is the fraction of inhibited ligands and ¯ R : = R √ ξ L is the dimensionless particle radius . Region boundaries are determined from Eq . ( 8 ) for diﬀerent dimensionless obstacle sizes , ¯ r : = r √ ξ L , and ratios between ligand and receptor densities , ¯ ξ 0 : = ξ 0 / ξ L . ( a ) Receptor - mediated endocytosis without protein coat for model parameters d = 1 , ¯ e RL = 15 , ¯ σ = 1 , ξ L = 5 · 10 − 3 nm − 2 , and ¯ κ c = ¯˜ κ c = ¯ e c = ¯ H (cid:63) = 0 . The curve provides the minimum radius ¯ R min and endocytosis is favored when ¯ R > ¯ R min . Vertical lines show the critical values of p that correspond to the limit case of ¯ R min → ∞ . ( b ) Clathrin - mediated endocytosis for model parameters d = 1 , ¯ e RL = 15 , ¯ σ = 1 , ξ L = 5 · 10 − 3 nm − 2 , ¯ H (cid:63) ≈ − 0 . 283 , ¯ κ c = 300 , ¯˜ κ c = 0 , and ¯ e c = 23 . The curve deﬁnes the minimum and maximum radii , ¯ R min and ¯ R max , and endocytosis is favored when ¯ R min < ¯ R < ¯ R max . The horizontal ( grey ) line reports the dimensionless radius of spontaneous curvature of the clathrin coat ¯ R (cid:63) = 1 / | ¯ H (cid:63) | ≈ 3 . 53 . In the absence of inhibitors ( p = 0 ) , the wrapping process starts only if the particle radius lies within the speciﬁc range R min ≤ R ≤ R max , with R max → ∞ in the absence of protein coat . In the case of inhibitors ( p > 0 ) without protrusions ( ¯ r = 0 ) , the range size [ R min , R max ] slightly contracts for moderate values of p ( see Fig . 4 ) . Finally , the presence of protruding inhibitors ( p > 0 and ¯ r > 0 ) signiﬁcantly shrinks the range of admissible radii until their density p reaches a critical value p (cid:63) = p (cid:63) ( ¯ r ) , above which the particle uptake is completely blocked . This shows the crucial impact of the inhibitor size ¯ r for moderate values of the fraction of inhibited ligands p . As observed in Fig . 4 , p (cid:63) is inversely related to ¯ r . For the coat - independent case , we can calculate such a threshold by solving the equality at Eq . ( 8 ) for ¯ R → ∞ and diﬀerent values of ¯ r ( see 8 Fig . 4a ) . In particular , we can write p (cid:63) explicitly for ¯ r = 0 ( see Appendix G ) and , with the parameters reported in Table 1 , we ﬁnd p (cid:63) ( ¯ r = 0 ) ≈ 0 . 995 for ¯ ξ 0 = 0 . 1 , and p (cid:63) ( ¯ r = 0 ) ≈ 0 . 999 for ¯ ξ 0 = 0 . 025 .

( a ) Receptor - mediated endocytosis without protein coat for model parameters d = 1 , ¯ e RL = 15 , ¯ σ = 1 , ξ L = 5 · 10 − 3 nm − 2 , and ¯ κ c = ¯˜ κ c = ¯ e c = ¯ H (cid:63) = 0 . ( b ) Clathrin - mediated endocytosis for model parameters d = 1 , ¯ e RL = 15 , ¯ σ = 1 , ξ L = 5 · 10 − 3 nm − 2 , ¯ H (cid:63) ≈ − 0 . 283 , ¯ κ c = 300 , ¯˜ κ c = 0 , and ¯ e c = 23 . Analogously , for a given inhibitor density p the inhibitor size ¯ r controls the range of particles for which the wrapping can initiate , and above a critical size ¯ r (cid:63) = ¯ r (cid:63) ( p ) the process is completely blocked . Fig . 5 shows that for small protrusion sizes ¯ r , the selected size range is almost independent of moderate densities p , while this becomes relevant for larger protrusions . In both Fig . 4b and Fig . 5b , the range of radii [ R min , R max ] is asymmetric with respect to the preferred radius of curvature of the coat R (cid:63) . This is due to the cost of bending the cell membrane , which diverges for ¯ R → 0 but vanishes for ¯ R → + ∞ , thus determining a lower bound but not an upper bound . It is the protein coat that introduces an upper bound in the particle size , because of its spontaneous curvature . Finally , similar results follow by varying the indentation parameter d of the spherical inhibitors , while keeping ﬁxed their size ¯ r . This corresponds to spherical inhibitors that protrude only partially , for d < 1 , or that are raised above the particle surface , for d > 1 ( see Fig . 3 ) . Indeed , the elastic energy increases both by enlarging and by lifting the inhibitors , due to bending and tension . Thus , diﬀerent geometries are equivalent in terms of the necessary condition for the wrapping given by Eq . ( 8 ) . Fig . 6 shows contour plots of ¯ R min in the space of parameters that deﬁne the geometry of the protruding inhibitor , ( d , ¯ r ) , for the case of coat - independent endocytosis and for a ﬁxed inhibitor density . As expected , the minimum radius is maximum when both the indentation and the size of the inhibitor are maximum , since such a conﬁguration raises the cost of bending the cell membrane . Discussion and conclusions We found that the cost of bending the cell membrane and the protein coat , if present , is a determining factor for the inhibition of particle wrapping during the process of endocytosis . For the case of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , the cost of bending the cell membrane implies the existence of a minimum radius , while a maximum radius arises from the cost of bending the clathrin coat , due to its preferred curvature . In the presence of inhibitors , the wrapping process depends on the radius and indentation depth of their protrusion , as well as their density . This reduces the size range of particles for which the wrapping process 9 Figure 6 : Level curves of the dimensionless minimum particle radius ( ¯ R min = R min √ ξ L ) for favorable endocytosis as a function of the dimensionless radius of the inhibitor , ¯ r : = r √ ξ L , and d . The indentation depth of the protrusion in the membrane , from the surface of the particle , is δ = 2 dr ( see Fig . 2 ) . Endocytosis is completely blocked by protrusions with parameters in the region on the right of the curves for ¯ R min = ∞ . The results are for diﬀerent values of the receptor density ¯ ξ 0 and the fraction of inhibited ligands p . Model parameters are ¯ e RL = 15 , ¯ σ = 1 , ξ L = 5 · 10 − 3 nm − 2 , ¯ κ c = ¯˜ κ = ¯ e c = 0 ( no protein coat ) , and ( a ) p = 0 . 15 ( b ) p = 0 . 25 . can initiate . Moreover , for a given inhibitor density , the uptake is completely blocked when the radius and indentation depth of the inhibitor are above given thresholds ( see Fig . 6 ) . We analyzed the case of a spherical particle with uniformly distributed protruding inhibitors . Real biological systems are expected to exhibit random distribution of inhibitors / protrusions , hence our model provides a coarse - grained analysis over a large population of particles / viruses . The current study provides a simple way to estimate the eﬃcacy of ligand - inhibitors in selectively blocking endocytosis in the presence and in the absence of protein ( clathrin ) coats . Quantitative validation of our ﬁndings is diﬃcult , due to the lack of experiments on the morphology considered in this study . However , when specialized to the case of spherical particles without protrusions , our results agree with experimental observations on clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Rejman et al . , 2004 ) , and are consistent with previous ﬁndings in the absence of clathrin ( Gao et al . , 2005 ) . Given our focus on the ( un ) favorable conditions for the initiation of the wrapping process , we neglected elastic deformations outside the wrapping zone . We also neglected the energetic contribution of cortical actin , which might help the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Collins et al . , 2011 ) . However , future research can investigate the role of all these processes by considering approaches available in the literature ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ; Yi and Gao , 2017 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) . In conclusion , it is worth emphasizing the potential implications of the present study . Our model pro - vides a tool for the design of novel molecular strategies for the morphological control of endocytosis , with applications ranging from viral antibodies to engineered nanoparticles for targeted diagnostics and thera - peutics . Indeed , our results suggest at least two strategies for targeted uptake . One possibility is to exploit overexpressed receptors on targeted cells to deliver nanoparticles that would not enter for lower receptor densities ( this corresponds to nanoparticles between continuous and dashed lines in Fig . 4 and Fig . 5 ) . An - other possibility is to design a particle with protrusions that can bind only to targeted cells , such that more restrictive conditions would apply to enter other cells . Contributions M .

Spacing between particle ligands For a large number N ≈ 4 πR 2 ξ L of ligands , we approximate the sphere of radius R with a polyhedron with H ≈ N / 3 hexagons of area A H = 3 √ 3 (cid:96) 2 / 2 . By comparing the surface areas of the polyhedron and the sphere , namely , 4 πR 2 ≈ 2 √ 3 πR 2 (cid:96) 2 ξ L , ( A . 1 ) we arrive at (cid:96) ∼ ξ − 1 / 2 L , which we adopt in our model as the spacing between two ligands . Appendix B . The maximum number of inhibitors In this study we assume that the wrapping process of the particle with inhibitors is driven by receptor - ligand binding around the protrusion . This condition is possible for the fraction of inhibited ligands p that is below a critical value p max , to assure the presence of a suﬃcient number of active ligands . Each protrusion is associated with a surface area of ∼ 2 πR 2 ( 1 − cos (cid:96) / R ) on the sphere . In the limit case of p = p max , there are at most N i ≈ 4 πR 2 2 πR 2 ( 1 − cos (cid:96) / R ) = 2 ( 1 − cos (cid:96) / R ) ( B . 1 ) inhibitors for N ≈ 4 πR 2 ξ L ligands . Because p = N i / N , from Eq . ( B . 1 ) , we deﬁne p max : = 1 2 π ¯ R 2 (cid:0) 1 − cos 1 / ¯ R (cid:1) . ( B . 2 ) In the limit of a large dimensionless radius ¯ R : = R √ ξ L , we get p max ≈ 1 / π . We observe that this is approx - imately in agreement with the hexagonal distribution , for which each ligand is adjacent to 3 protrusions , such that each protrusion is associated with 2 ligands and p max ≈ 1 / 3 . Appendix C . Condition for endocytosis In this section we derive the condition for endocytosis of a particle with protruding inhibitors . The free energy of the cell membrane is the sum of the surface free energy density integrated over the contact region S w , and over the remaining area of the membrane , S \ S w , giving ¯ E = (cid:90) S w (cid:110)(cid:104) 2¯ κ m ¯ H 2 + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) ¯ H − ¯ H (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c ¯ K (cid:105) − (cid:0) ¯ ξ p ¯ e RL + ¯ ξ c ¯ e c (cid:1) + ¯ ξ p ln (cid:0) ¯ ξ p / ¯ ξ 0 (cid:1)(cid:111) d ¯ A + (cid:90) S \ S w ¯ ξ ln (cid:0) ¯ ξ / ¯ ξ 0 (cid:1) d ¯ A + ¯ σ ∆ ¯ A ( C . 1 ) with the notation introduced in the main text . In particular , we recall that ξ p is the receptor density on the cell membrane in the contact region given by Eq . ( 1 ) . 11 Splitting the wrapping region S w into representative regions , S p , wrapping one single protrusion , and the remaining surface adhering to the spherical part of the particle , from Eq . ( 1 ) and Eq . ( C . 1 ) we have ¯ E = − ¯ A w (cid:20) 1 − p α p (cid:18) ¯ e RL + ln α p ¯ ξ 0 1 − p (cid:19) + ¯ ξ c ¯ e c (cid:21) + p ¯ A w α p (cid:90) S p (cid:104) 2¯ κ m ¯ H 2 + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) ¯ H − ¯ H (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c ¯ K (cid:105) d ¯ A + (cid:18) 1 − p ¯ A p α p (cid:19) ¯ A w ¯ R 2 (cid:104) 2¯ κ m + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) 1 − ¯ R / ¯ R (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c (cid:105) + ¯ σ ∆ ¯ A + 2 π (cid:90) ∞ ¯ ρ 0 ( t ) ¯ ξ ln (cid:0) ¯ ξ / ¯ ξ 0 (cid:1) ¯ ρ d¯ ρ . ( C . 2 ) Here we used the polar coordinate ρ ( given the axial symmetry of the problem ) to rewrite the integral over the unwrapped ( ﬂat ) region S \ S w with ρ 0 the radius of the projection of S w on the plane , S pw ( see Fig . 2a ) . During wrapping the contact area A w increases with time and ρ 0 varies accordingly . For protrusions of small size , r , with respect to the particle radius , R , we have ρ 0 ≈ R sin β w ( C . 3 ) where β w is the contact ( wrapping ) angle ( Fig . 2a ) . Moreover , ¯ A w (cid:18) 1 − p α p ∆ ¯ A p (cid:19) = 2 π ¯ R 2 ( 1 − cos β w ) ( C . 4 ) where ∆ ¯ A p : = A p − A sp is the diﬀerence between the surface area of S p ( A p ) and the one of its projection on the spherical particle ( A sp ) . Combining Eq . ( C . 3 ) and Eq . ( C . 4 ) , we arrive at ¯ ρ 20 = ¯ A w πα p (cid:18) 1 − ¯ A w 4 π ¯ R 2 α p (cid:19) . ( C . 5 ) Following Freund and Lin ( 2004 ) , we assume that receptors diﬀuse through the cell membrane according to the second Fick’s law giving the rate of change of receptor density as ˙ ξ = D ∆ ξ , where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and a dot denotes the time derivative . In axial symmetry this equation reads as ˙ ξ = D ρ ∂ ∂ρ (cid:18) ρ∂ξ∂ρ (cid:19) . ( C . 6 ) Rewriting then Eq . ( C . 6 ) in dimensionless form we have ˙¯ ξ = Dξ L ¯ ρ ∂ ∂ ¯ ρ (cid:18) ¯ ρ∂ ¯ ξ ∂ ¯ ρ (cid:19) . ( C . 7 ) Moreover , by imposing the conservation of cell receptors , we get 0 = ∂ ∂t (cid:18) 1 − p α p ¯ A w + 2 π (cid:90) ∞ ¯ ρ 0 ¯ ξ ¯ ρ d¯ ρ (cid:19) = 1 − p α p ˙¯ A w − 2 π ¯ ρ 0 ˙¯ ρ 0 ¯ ξ + + 2 π (cid:90) ∞ ¯ ρ 0 ˙¯ ξ ¯ ρ d¯ ρ = 1 − p α p ˙¯ A w − 2 π ¯ ρ 0 ˙¯ ρ 0 ¯ ξ + + 2 πDξ L (cid:90) ∞ ¯ ρ 0 ∂ ∂ ¯ ρ (cid:18) ¯ ρ∂ ¯ ξ ∂ ¯ ρ (cid:19) d¯ ρ ( C . 8 ) whence Dξ L ¯ ξ (cid:48) + = 1 − p 2 π ¯ ρ 0 α p ˙¯ A w − ˙¯ ρ 0 ¯ ξ + ( C . 9 ) where ¯ ξ + : = lim ¯ ρ → ¯ ρ + 0 ¯ ξ and ¯ ξ (cid:48) + : = lim ¯ ρ → ¯ ρ + 0 ∂ ¯ ξ∂ ¯ ρ are the limit values of the cell receptor density and its radial derivative at the front of the wrapping region , respectively . 12 Finally , by taking the time derivative of the free energy ( C . 2 ) , plugging in Eq . ( C . 7 ) , integrating by parts , and exploiting Eq . ( C . 9 ) together with the time derivative of Eq . ( C . 5 ) and the approximation ∆ ¯ A ≈ ¯ A w − π ¯ ρ 20 , we arrive at ˙¯ E = − ˙¯ A w (cid:26) 1 − p α p ¯ e RL + ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + 1 − p α p (cid:18) 1 + ln ¯ ξ + ¯ ξ 0 + ln α p ¯ ξ 0 1 − p (cid:19) − 1 α p (cid:18) 1 − ¯ A w 2 π ¯ R 2 α p (cid:19) ¯ ξ + − (cid:18) 1 − p α p ¯ A p (cid:19) 1¯ R 2 (cid:34) 2¯ κ m + 2¯ κ c (cid:18) 1 − ¯ R ¯ R (cid:63) (cid:19) 2 + ¯˜ κ c (cid:35) − p α p (cid:90) S p (cid:104) 2¯ κ m ¯ H 2 + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) ¯ H − ¯ H (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c ¯ K (cid:105) d ¯ A − ¯ σ (cid:20) 1 − 1 α p (cid:18) 1 − ¯ A w 2 π ¯ R 2 α p (cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:27) − 2 πDξ L (cid:90) + ∞ ¯ ρ 0 ( t ) ¯ ξ (cid:18) ∂ ln ¯ ξ ∂ ¯ ρ (cid:19) 2 ¯ ρ d¯ ρ ( C . 10 ) where the last integral term represents the rate of energy consumed during receptor transport ( Freund and Lin , 2004 ) . By assuming that the rate of the free energy reduction is greater than or equal to the one of energy dissipation due to receptor transport , we derive the inequality ( 1 − p ) ¯ e RL + α p ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + ( 1 − p ) (cid:18) 1 + ln ¯ ξ + ¯ ξ 0 + ln α p ¯ ξ 0 1 − p (cid:19) − (cid:18) 1 − ¯ A w 2 π ¯ R 2 α p (cid:19) ¯ ξ + ≥ + (cid:0) α p − p ¯ A p (cid:1) 1¯ R 2 (cid:34) 2¯ κ m + 2¯ κ c (cid:18) 1 − ¯ R ¯ R (cid:63) (cid:19) 2 + ¯˜ κ c (cid:35) + p (cid:90) S p (cid:104) 2¯ κ m ¯ H 2 + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) ¯ H − ¯ H (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c ¯ K (cid:105) d ¯ A + ¯ σ (cid:20) α p − (cid:18) 1 − ¯ A w 2 π ¯ R 2 α p (cid:19)(cid:21) . ( C . 11 ) Finally , by approximating ¯ ξ + ≈ ¯ ξ 0 and ¯ A w ≈ 2 π ¯ R 2 ( 1 − cos β w ) α p , we get ( 1 − p ) ¯ e RL + α p ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + ( 1 − p ) (cid:18) 1 + ln α p ¯ ξ 0 1 − p (cid:19) − cos β w ¯ ξ 0 ≥ ( 1 − p / p max ) (cid:104) 2¯ κ m + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) 1 − ¯ R / ¯ R (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c (cid:105) 1¯ R 2 + p (cid:90) S p (cid:104) 2¯ κ m ¯ H 2 + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) ¯ H − ¯ H (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c K (cid:105) d ¯ A + ( α p − cos β w ) ¯ σ . ( C . 12 ) Eq . ( 8 ) follows by setting β w = 0 in Eq . ( C . 12 ) , and it reduces to Eq . ( 7 ) for p = 0 . Appendix D . The critical spontaneous curvature Eq . ( 7 ) provides a necessary condition for initiating wrapping of a spherical particle . This is a quadratic inequality in the dimensionless radius ¯ R , namely , a ¯ R 2 + b ¯ R − c ≥ 0 ( D . 1 ) where a : = ¯ e RL + ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + 1 − ¯ ξ 0 + ln ¯ ξ 0 − 2¯ κ c / ¯ R (cid:63) 2 , b : = 4¯ κ c / ¯ R (cid:63) , and c : = 2 ( ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c ) + ¯˜ κ c . Thus , the presence of a protein coat with a spontaneous curvature can determine a maximum value ¯ R max for the particle radius if a < 0 , i . e . if the spontaneous radius of curvature satisﬁes ¯ R (cid:63) < ¯ R (cid:63) 0 : = (cid:115) 2¯ κ c ¯ e RL + ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + 1 − ¯ ξ 0 + ln ¯ ξ 0 . ( D . 2 ) In passing , we notice that we implicitly assumed that ¯ e RL + ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + 1 − ¯ ξ 0 > − ln ¯ ξ 0 , otherwise the binding energy would be insuﬃcient to drive the wrapping . 13 Appendix E . The obstacle problem We determine the conﬁguration of the membrane in a region associated with a protrusion , S p , as solution to the obstacle problem ( i . e . the minimization of the free energy of the membrane within the limits of compatibility ) min ¯ h ∈K (cid:90) S p (cid:104) 2¯ κ m ¯ H 2 + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) ¯ H − ¯ H (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯ σ (cid:105) d ¯ A ( E . 1 ) where K is the set of all admissible conﬁgurations for the cell membrane wrapping the inhibitor and being clamped to the particle at the boundary ∂ S p . In Eq . ( E . 1 ) we dropped the saddle - splay term of the protein coat because the prescribed boundary conditions force the geodesic curvature at the boundary so that integral of the Gaussian curvature amounts to a constant , in view of the Gauss - Bonnet theorem . We adopt the Monge parametrization to describe both the membrane and the obstacle and , by assuming axial symmetry of the problem , we introduce the corresponding dimensionless heights ¯ h ( ¯ ρ ) and ¯ h 0 ( ¯ ρ ) as functions of the dimensionless polar coordinate ¯ ρ . Thus , the problem reads as min ¯ h ∈ ¯ K (cid:90) ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) 0 (cid:32) 2 ¯ H 2 − 4¯ κ c ¯ H (cid:63) ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c ¯ H + 2¯ κ c ¯ H (cid:63) 2 + ¯ σ ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c (cid:33) ¯ ρ (cid:112) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 d¯ ρ ( E . 2 ) with the membrane conﬁguration ¯ h belonging to the set of suﬃciently regular height functions that fulﬁll the compatibility constraints , i . e . , ¯ K : =   v : v ≥ ¯ h 0 for 0 ≤ ρ ≤ ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) v = ¯ h 0 at ¯ ρ = ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) v (cid:48) = ¯ h (cid:48) 0 at ¯ ρ = ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) v (cid:48) = v (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 at ¯ ρ = 0   ( E . 3 ) where primes denote diﬀerentiation with respect to ¯ ρ . In particular , we deﬁne the obstacle as ¯ h 0 ( ¯ ρ ) = max (cid:8) ¯ h p , ¯ h i (cid:9) ( E . 4 ) where ¯ h p is the height function of the particle , and ¯ h i is the height function of the inhibitor , namely ¯ h p : = (cid:113) ¯ R 2 − ¯ ρ 2 − ¯ R cos 1¯ R ( E . 5 ) and ¯ h i : = (cid:40)(cid:112) ¯ r 2 − ¯ ρ 2 − ¯ r + ¯ δ + ¯ R (cid:0) 1 − cos 1¯ R (cid:1) if ¯ ρ 2 ≤ ¯ r 2 0 if ¯ ρ 2 > ¯ r 2 ( E . 6 ) where ¯ r : = r √ ξ L is the dimensionless radius of the spherical protrusion and ¯ δ : = δ √ ξ L is the dimensionless indentation δ = 2 dr ( see Fig . 3 ) . In terms of the adopted parametrization , the mean curvature of the membrane having height ¯ h ( ¯ ρ ) is given by ¯ H ( ¯ ρ ) = ¯ ρ ¯ h (cid:48)(cid:48) + ¯ h (cid:48) (cid:0) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 (cid:1) 2¯ ρ (cid:0) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 (cid:1) 3 / 2 . ( E . 7 ) The obstacle problem ( E . 2 ) - ( E . 4 ) depends only on the three dimensionless parameters that deﬁne the speciﬁc geometry of the obstacle , i . e . , ¯ r , ¯ δ , and ¯ R , and the two dimensionless parameters 4¯ κ c ¯ H (cid:63) / ( ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c ) and (cid:16) 2¯ κ c ¯ H (cid:63) 2 + ¯ σ (cid:17) / ( ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c ) . This problem is a variational inequality and we solve it numerically by using the penalty method ( e . g . , see Glowinski ( 1984 ) and references therein ) , namely , we minimize the penalized functional (cid:90) ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) 0 (cid:32) 2 ¯ H 2 − 4¯ κ c ¯ H (cid:63) ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c ¯ H + 2¯ κ c ¯ H (cid:63) 2 + ¯ σ ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c (cid:33) ¯ ρ (cid:112) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 d¯ ρ + P 2 (cid:90) ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) 0 (cid:104)(cid:0) ¯ h − ¯ h 0 (cid:1) − (cid:105) 2 ¯ ρ d¯ ρ ( E . 8 ) 14 where ( · ) − : = min { 0 , · } is the “negative part” function and P (cid:29) 1 is the penalty parameter . We derive the weak form of the problem as a system of the two following variational equations , i . e . , 0 = (cid:90) ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) 0 ˜ h (cid:48) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 (cid:34) 2 (cid:18) ¯ H − ¯ κ c ¯ H (cid:63) ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c (cid:19) ¯ h (cid:48) 2 + (cid:32) 3 ¯ H 2 + 2¯ κ c ¯ H (cid:63) 2 + ¯ σ ¯ κ m + ¯ κ c (cid:33) ¯ ρ ¯ h (cid:48) (cid:112) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 − 2¯ ρ ¯ H (cid:48) (cid:35) d¯ ρ + P (cid:90) ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) 0 ˜ h (cid:0) ¯ h − ¯ h 0 (cid:1) − ¯ ρ d¯ ρ ( E . 9 ) 0 = (cid:90) ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) 0 ˜ H (cid:32) 2 ¯ H − ¯ h (cid:48) ¯ ρ (cid:112) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 (cid:33) d¯ ρ + (cid:90) ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) 0 ˜ H (cid:48) ¯ h (cid:48) (cid:112) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 d¯ ρ − ˜ H ¯ h (cid:48) (cid:112) 1 + ¯ h (cid:48) 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ¯ R sin ( 1 / ¯ R ) 0 ( E . 10 ) where ˜ h and ˜ H are the test functions . We implemented and solved the weak formulation ( E . 9 ) - ( E . 10 ) via ﬁnite element analysis based on the FEniCS Project Version 2019 . 1 . 0 ( Logg et al . , 2012 ) . For our numerical simulations we used a penalty parameter P = 10 8 . The Python code is available at https : / / github . com / daniele - agostinelli / ObstacleProblem . git . Appendix F . Single - spaced and double - spaced conﬁgurations Throughout this study we assumed that the cellular membrane wrapping around an inhibitor binds to the closest active ligands located at distance (cid:96) from the inhibitor ( single - spaced conﬁguration ) . However , other conﬁgurations might be more energetically convenient , for example one in which the membrane binds to active ligands located at a distance 2 (cid:96) ( double - spaced conﬁguration ) . If each inhibitor is associated with an area corresponding to n times the angle (cid:96) / R , there are at most ∼ 2 / (cid:0) 1 − cos ( n / ¯ R ) (cid:1) inhibitors . By comparing this number with 4 π ¯ R 2 p , we get the relationship p = 1 2 π ¯ R 2 (cid:2) 1 − cos (cid:0) n / ¯ R (cid:1)(cid:3) ≈ 1 πn 2 ( F . 1 ) where the last approximation holds for ¯ R (cid:29) 1 ( large particle or high ligand density ) . From the estimate ( F . 1 ) , a conﬁguration with a doubled angle ( double - spaced ) is possible for p < 0 . 08 . In this case we can compare the energies of the single - spaced ( n = 1 ) and double - spaced ( n = 2 ) conﬁgurations shown in Fig . F . 7 . The latter is convenient if ∆ ( E el + E ad ) = (cid:16) E ( 2 ) el − E ( 1 ) el (cid:17) + (cid:16) E ( 2 ) ad − E ( 1 ) ad (cid:17) ≤ 0 ( F . 2 ) with ( 1 ) indicating single - spaced conﬁguration and ( 2 ) double - spaced . Figure F . 7 : Two - dimensional illustration of the ( a ) single - space ( n = 1 ) and ( b ) double - spaced ( n = 2 ) conﬁgurations . For a low fraction of inhibited ligands , p ∼ 0 . 1 , the former might be energetically more expensive than the latter , where cell receptors do not bind to the ligands that are proximal to the protrusion . Fig . F . 8 shows the domains of the two conﬁgurations in the parameter space (cid:0) ¯ r , ¯ R (cid:1) , for selected values of the model parameters . Fig . F . 8a reports the case of receptor - mediated endocytosis , in the absemce of protein coats , while Fig . F . 8b reports the case of protein coat . In the latter case , compared to the former , we observe higher sensitivity to ¯ R , while receptor density ¯ ξ 0 is less inﬂuential . 15 Figure F . 8 : Comparison between the energetic cost of single - spaced and double - spaced conﬁgurations : larger protrusions ( increasing ¯ r ) leads to higher bending cost , which might ( not ) be compensated by the enthalpic gain due to receptor - ligand bindings , thus resulting in a critical threshold of the inhibitor size , ¯ r . The parameter space (cid:0) ¯ R , ¯ r (cid:1) is split into regions where one conﬁguration is more convenient than the other one , as indicate in the plots ( ¯ r above the line provides double - spaced ) . We report the boundaries of these regions for diﬀerent values of the ratio between receptors and ligands , ¯ ξ 0 : = ξ 0 / ξ L , for the case of ( a ) receptor - mediated endocytosis without any protein coat ( ¯ κ c = ¯˜ κ c = ¯ H (cid:63) = ¯ e c = 0 ) and ( b ) clathrin - mediated endocytosis for ¯ H (cid:63) ≈ − 0 . 28 , ¯ κ c = 300 , ¯˜ κ c = 0 , ¯ e c = 23 . We set d = 1 and other model parameters as ¯ e RL = 15 , ¯ σ = 1 , ξ L = 5 · 10 − 3 nm − 2 , p ≈ 0 . 08 . Appendix G . The eﬀect of inhibiting ligands without protrusions In this appendix we examine the eﬀect of inhibiting particle ligands without protrusions ( p > 0 and ¯ r = 0 ) . In this case Eq . ( 8 ) yields ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + ( 1 − p ) (cid:18) ¯ e RL + 1 + ln ¯ ξ 0 1 − p (cid:19) − ¯ ξ 0 ≥ (cid:104) 2¯ κ m + 2¯ κ c (cid:0) 1 − ¯ R / ¯ R (cid:63) (cid:1) 2 + ¯˜ κ c (cid:105) 1¯ R 2 . ( G . 1 ) By assuming that ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + ( 1 − p ) (cid:2) ¯ e RL + 1 + ln (cid:0) ¯ ξ 0 / ( 1 − p ) (cid:1)(cid:3) ≥ ¯ ξ 0 , the presence of clathrin provides both a minimum and a maximum value for the particle radius if the spontaneous radius of curvature satisﬁes ¯ R (cid:63) < (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116) 2¯ κ c ¯ ξ c ¯ e c + ( 1 − p ) (cid:16) ¯ e RL + 1 + ln ¯ ξ 0 1 − p (cid:17) − ¯ ξ 0 . ( G . 2 ) If clathrin is absent or the spontaneous radius of curvature is above such a threshold , there exists only a minimum particle radius . In particular , in the absence of clathrin , we get ¯ R min = (cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117) (cid:116) 2¯ κ m ( 1 − p ) (cid:16) ¯ e RL + 1 + ln ¯ ξ 0 1 − p (cid:17) − ¯ ξ 0 . ( G . 3 ) Since ( 1 − p ) (cid:16) ¯ e RL + 1 + ln ¯ ξ 0 1 − p (cid:17) → 0 + for p → 1 − , the denominator vanishes at p = p (cid:63) where p (cid:63) < 1 . More precisely , for the relevant parameter values , p (cid:63) = 1 + ¯ ξ 0 W − 1 ( − e − 1 − ¯ e RL ) ( G . 4 ) where W k ( · ) denotes the k th branch of the Lambert W - Function . Then ¯ R min → + ∞ for p → p (cid:63) − . We observe that the critical fraction p (cid:63) ( ¯ r = 0 ) is above 97 % for the parameters used in this study , and e RL ≥ ¯ ξ 0 − 1 − ln ¯ ξ 0 , which is the minimum receptor - ligand binding energy for having suﬃcient driving force . This implies that , in the absence of clathrin , inhibiting ligands without additional bending penalty is an ineﬃcient method of blocking the wrapping , since almost all ligands should be inhibited . 16 References Banerjee , A . , Berezhkovskii , A . , Nossal , R . , 2012 .
