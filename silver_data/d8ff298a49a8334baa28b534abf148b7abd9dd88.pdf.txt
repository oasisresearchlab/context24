Thus , TRAP / Mediator has been shown to studies show that MED1 / TRAP220 is required for ER - mediate nuclear receptor functions in purified cell - free mediated transcription and estrogen - dependent breast systems ( Fondell et al . , 1996 ; Ge et al . , 2002 ; Kang et cancer cell growth .

Consistent with its key role in mediating TRAP / Medi - ator - dependent nuclear receptor function , MED1 / TRAP220 * Correspondence : roeder @ rockefeller . edu Molecular Cell 90 has generally been considered an integral core subunit of the TRAP / Mediator complex ( see Discussion ) . Con - sistent with this notion , the presumptive yeast ortholog ( Med1 ) of MED1 / TRAP220 has been considered a core subunit of yeast Mediator ( Boube et al . , 2002 ) . How - ever , both a MED1 disruption in yeast ( Balciunas et al . , 1999 ) and a Med1 / Trap220 deletion in mammalian cells ( Ito et al . , 2000 ) display only conditional phenotypes . Moreover , it recently has been shown that the residual TRAP / Mediator complex in Med1 / Trap220 − / − mouse embryonic fibroblasts is essentially intact and retains basal transcription functions and coactivator functions for other activators ( Malik et al . , 2004 ) , suggesting a tangential association of MED1 / TRAP220 with the com - plex . Therefore , these data raise an important question as to whether MED1 / TRAP220 is an integral core sub - unit of all TRAP / Mediator complexes or whether it ex - ists only in a specialized TRAP / Mediator complex that subserves specific functions . Toward a better understanding of the role of MED1 / TRAP220 and cognate TRAP / Mediator complexes in nuclear receptor function , this study has investigated , through structural and functional studies , heterogeneity within TRAP / Mediator complexes , with a special focus on the MED1 / TRAP220 - containing TRAP / Mediator .

MED1 / TRAP220 only exists in a subpopulation of TRAP / ( Malik and Roeder , 2005 ; Blazek et al . , 2005 ) . It is be - lieved that PC2 - , CRSP - , or B - Med - like complexes Mediator complexes ; ( 2 ) that the MED1 / TRAP220 - con - taining TRAP / Mediator population is enriched in spe - ( minimally defective in MED13 / TRAP240 , MED12 / TRAP230 , cyclin C , and CDK8 ) represent a Mediator cific Mediator subunits ( or associated proteins ) relative to the predominant MED1 / TRAP220 - deficient popula - core with which other modules loosely ( and dynami - cally ) associate . These modules include a subcomplex tion ; ( 3 ) that the MED1 / TRAP220 - containing popula - tion shows a preferential association , relative to the composed of MED23 / hSUR2 , MED24 / TRAP100 , and MED16 / TRAP95 polypeptides ( Ito et al . , 2002 ; Stevens predominant ( MED1 / TRAP220 - deficient ) TRAP / Media - tor population , with RNA polymerase II and is able to et al . , 2002 ) and the MED13 / TRAP240 , MED12 / TRAP230 , cyclin C , and CDK8 subcomplex ( Malik and Roeder , mediate both basal and activator - dependent transcrip - tion in the absence of additional RNA polymerase II in 2005 ; Samuelsen et al . , 2003 ) . MED1 / TRAP220 has generally been considered a core subunit despite varia - a highly purified in vitro transcription system ; ( 4 ) that MED1 / TRAP220 - containing and MED1 / TRAP220 - defi - tions in MED1 / TRAP220 levels among different human Mediator preparations ( Malik et al . , 2004 ; Taatjes and cient TRAP / Mediator complexes are selectively re - cruited to estrogen - activated and ER - dependent and Tjian , 2004 ) . Because most Mediator complexes docu - mented to date have been isolated through methods UV - activated and p53 - dependent promoters , respec - tively ; and ( 5 ) that MED1 / TRAP220 is required both for that include ion exchange chromatography , variable levels of MED1 / TRAP220 in some of these Mediator ER - dependent transactivation and for estrogen - depen - dent growth of breast cancer cells . The implications of preparations were thought to reflect disassociation of certain subunits , including MED1 / TRAP220 , from the these findings for our current understanding of TRAP / Mediator structure and function are discussed . complex during chromatography . Importantly , and contradictory to some of the earlier ideas , this study has provided strong evidence that Heterogeneity and Specificity of TRAP / Mediator Complexes MED1 / TRAP220 naturally exists only in a subpopula - tion of TRAP / Mediator complexes . This is evident from TRAP / Mediator consists of 25 – 30 subunits that are thought to assemble in relatively discrete modules immunodepletion studies and subsequent immuno - MED1 / TRAP220 - Containing TRAP / Mediator 97 lective distribution of these , or other Mediator compo - nents , among any specific Mediator complexes . The finding that MED1 / TRAP220 exists only in a sub - population of TRAP / Mediator complexes extends our understanding of TRAP / Mediator heterogeneity beyond the above - mentioned modular model . Moreover , our re - sults indicate an enrichment of certain TRAP / Mediator subunits in the MED1 / TRAP220 - containing TRAP / Media - tor complex . The finding of additional heterogeneity and structural complexity within TRAP / Mediator com - plexes suggests more diverse functional and regulatory roles through various structurally distinct TRAP / Media - tor subpopulations . Related , and most significantly , our results have shown that different TRAP / Mediator sub - populations can be specifically recruited to different target gene promoters . Specifically , the MED1 / TRAP220 - containing TRAP / Mediator complex is selectively re - cruited to an ER - dependent target - gene ( pS2 ) promoter in response to estrogen , whereas a MED1 / TRAP220 - deficient TRAP / Mediator complex is recruited to the p53 - dependent p21 gene promoter upon UV treatment . TRAP / Mediator and RNA Polymerase II Mediator was initially isolated from yeast in association with RNA polymerase II in the form of a holoenzyme either with ( Thompson et al . , 1993 ) or without ( Kim et al . , 1994 ) other associated general transcription fac - tors . However , because only extremely low ( Malik et al . , 2005 ; Sato et al . , 2004 ) or nondetectable levels of RNA polymerase II have been reported for the bulk of TRAP / Mediator complexes thus far isolated from mammalian cells , it has been uncertain as to whether any signifi - Figure 7 .

( B ) Experiments were performed as described in ( A ) except that complex can also exist as a holoenzyme . More recently , control ( GFP ) siRNAs were employed . one study ( Sato et al . , 2004 ) detected a low level of RNA polymerase II in bulk Mediator preparations , albeit with no functions demonstrated , whereas a study from our lab ( Malik et al . , 2005 ) has documented a functional precipitation experiments with unfractionated nuclear extract and antibodies against MED1 / TRAP220 and association of RNA polymerase II with the PC2 / Media - tor complex . These and other studies ( Naar et al . , 2002 ; several TRAP / Mediator core subunits . We also have confirmed the marked enrichment of several Mediator Samuelsen et al . , 2003 ) also suggest that RNA polymer - ase II and the MED13 / TRAP240 , MED12 / TRAP230 , subunits ( including MED25 / ARC92 / ACID1 , MED15 / TIG1 , MED19 / LCMR , and MED11 / HSPC296 ) in the MED1 / cyclin C , and CDK8 modules exhibit mutually exclusive , stable interactions with TRAP / Mediator complex . Al - TRAP220 - containing complex relative to the predomi - nant MED1 / TRAP220 - deficient population of TRAP / though our MED1 / TRAP220 - containing TRAP / Mediator preparation contains MED13 / TRAP240 , MED12 / TRAP230 , Mediator ; and several of these enriched subunits have also been found to be recruited along with MED1 / cyclin C , and CDK8 as well as RNA polymerase II , our results do not necessarily contradict the conclusions TRAP220 to the pS2 promoter in response to estrogen stimulation ( Figure S1 ) . Other more recently identified of these studies . Thus , it is possible that our MED1 / TRAP220 - containing preparation is heterogeneous and subunits for which reliable antibodies necessary for quantitation are unavailable , including MED13L / PRO - contains at least two Mediator complexes : one that contains a core Mediator in association with RNA poly - SIT240 , MED9 / FLJ10193 , MED29 / Hintersex , and MED28 / FSKG20 , remain to be scored for selective distribution merase II and another that contains a core Mediator in association with MED13 / TRAP240 , MED12 / TRAP230 , in MED1 / TRAP220 - containing versus MED1 / TRAP220 - deficient complexes . While this manuscript was in cyclin C , and CDK8 . Structural studies of yeast holoen - zyme have shown extensive interactions between the preparation , others have identified most of these pro - teins as TRAP / Mediator subunits ( or associated pro - “head” domain of Mediator and RNA polymerase II ( Chadick and Asturias , 2005 ) , whereas structural teins ) by other means ( Mittler et al . , 2003 ; Sato et al . , 2004 ) .

Therefore , it is highly possible that MED1 / TRAP220 itself and / or proteins that are specific to the TRAP220 - containing TRAP / Mediator ( by estrogen - acti - vated ER ) versus MED1 / TRAP220 - defective TRAP / MED1 / TRAP220 - containing complex , alone or together with other TRAP / Mediator subunits , may somehow sta - Mediator ( by UV - activated p53 ) .

Thus , it tially suggested for the yeast holoenzyme , recent struc - tural studies have suggested that threading of template has been reported that the coactivator SRC - 1 is ex - pressed at a higher level in endometrial cells than in DNA on RNA polymerase II may require dissociation of Mediator and RNA polymerase II ( Chadick and Asturias , mammary epithelial cells and that this represents the molecular basis for the activation versus repression 2005 ) and , therefore , favors a two - step recruitment of Mediator and RNA polymerase II . Furthermore , it has functions of tamoxifen in ER - mediated transcription in the respective tissues ( Shang and Brown , 2002 ) .

It has been reported that binding of Mediator centage of breast cancer cells ( Zhu et al . , 1999 ) .
