Osteoblast mineralization requires b 1 integrin / ICAP - 1 – dependent fibronectin deposition Molly Brunner , Angélique Millon - Frémillon , Genevieve Chevalier , Inaam A . Nakchbandi , Deane Mosher , Marc R . Block , Corinne Albigès - Rizo , and Daniel Bouvard Vol . 194 No . 2 , July 25 , 2011 . Pages 307 – 322 . The DMSO Fn and Act panels for Icap - 1 + / + and Icap - 1 2 / 2 in the original version of Fig . 1 D were duplicates of the Fn and Act panels for Icap - 1 WT and Icap - 1 2 / 2 , respectively , in Fig . 2 A . The authors have indicated that this was due to a clerical error during figure preparation . A corrected version of the Western blots from Fig . 1 D is shown below . The html and pdf versions of this article have been corrected . The error remains only in the print version . JCB : Correction Figure 1 . ( D ) ROCK and ICAP - 1 additive control of cell compaction and fibronectin deposition . ( top ) Fibronectin deposition was monitored in Icap - 1 + / + ( wild type ) and Icap - 1 2 / 2 osteoblasts treated with DMSO ( control ) or ROCK inhibitor ( Y27632 ) . Fibronectin amounts ( Fn ) were estimated by Western blotting , and the protein load was normalized using actin ( Act ) . Sol , soluble ; Insol , insoluble .
