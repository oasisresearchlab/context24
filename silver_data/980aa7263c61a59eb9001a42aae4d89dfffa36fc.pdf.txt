This can be observed in vitro , where muscle cell behaviour is influenced by the particular culture sub - strates and whether culture is performed in a 2D or 3D environment , with changes including morphology , nuclear shape and cytoskeletal organization . To create a 3D skeletal muscle model we compared collagen I , Fibrin or PEG - Fibrinogen with different sources of murine and human myogenic cells . To generate tension in the 3D scaffold , biomaterials were poly - merised between two flexible silicone posts to mimic tendons . This 3D culture system has multiple advantages including being simple , fast to set up and inexpensive , so providing an accessible tool to investigate myogenesis in a 3D environment . Immortalised human and murine myoblast lines , and primary murine satellite cells showed varying degrees of myo - genic differentiation when cultured in these biomaterials , with C2 myoblasts in particular forming large multinucleated myotubes in collagen I or Fibrin . However , murine satellite cells retained in their niche on a muscle fibre and embedded in 3D collagen I or Fibrin gels generated aligned , multinucleated and contractile myotubes . Introduction Skeletal muscle represents the most abundant tissue in man , comprising approximately 38 % of total body weight in males , and 30 % in females [ 1 ] . Skeletal muscle contraction controls volun - tary body movement , from postural maintenance to locomotion , as well as having important metabolic functions and generating heat for body temperature regulation . Skeletal muscles are composed of multiple muscle fibres . These large , cylindrical , multinu - cleated and contractile cells are formed from the fusion of many myoblasts . Contractile func - tion of muscle fibres is controlled by innervation , and supported by a network of blood vessels and connective tissue and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) .

The Zammitlaboratory is additionally supported by the Medical Research Council , FSH Society , AssociationFranc¸aise contre characteristically found in skeletal muscle are collagens ( e . g . collagens I , III and IV ) , proteogly - cans ( syndecans , decorin ) , fibronectin and laminin [ 2 ] . Adult myofibres are post mitotic but skeletal muscle has a remarkable capacity to repair / regenerate after certain types of damage due to resident muscle stem cells called satellite cells [ 3 – 5 ] . Satellite cells are mitotically quiescent in adult skeletal muscle and reside beneath the basal lamina surrounding each muscle fibre . After damage , satellite cells are activated to prolif - erate to provide myoblast progeny , that subsequently differentiate to form nascent muscle fibres , or repair damaged myofibres by supplying new myonuclei by fusing with them . Satellite cells also self - renew to maintain a viable stem cell compartment [ 6 ] . In large volume muscle injuries or some chronic diseases such as muscular dystrophies however , damage may exceed the capacity for functional regeneration [ 7 ] . In volumetric mus - cle loss , the reparative , stabilizing fibrotic response inhibits new muscle formation . Dense fibrotic tissue can also inhibit neural and vascular ingrowth to render muscle denervated and ischaemic . In chronic degenerative diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) , muscle continuously cycles between degeneration and regeneration , which eventually result in fibrosis , fat accumulation , and a decline in regenerative potential of satellite cells [ 8 ] . With aging , loss of muscle mass and function is amplified by decrease in satellite cell numbers and an impairment of their regenerative capacity due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors [ 9 ] . Modelling muscle formation / regeneration in vitro is essential to both understand the pro - cess , and how to generate sufficient satellite cells / muscle for therapeutic grafting . In vitro expansion of satellite cells though , can quickly cause loss of their regenerative potential [ 6 , 8 , 10 – 12 ] . In addition to various small molecules that can increase satellite cell expansion ex - vivo [ 13 , 14 ] , properties of the culture substrate is also a factor [ 10 ] . This is unsurprising , since com - ponents of the ECM are essential to support the regeneration process [ 15 ] . For example , colla - gen V and VI in the satellite cell niche is essential to prevent exhaustion of the satellite cell pool [ 16 , 17 ] and laminin in the niche is actively remodelled during repair [ 18 ] . Furthermore , fac - tors in the niche also support muscle regeneration by stimulating growth of blood vessels ( VEGF , angiopoietin ) or innervation of the newly formed muscle fibres ( NERFs ) [ 19 , 20 ] . Thus , efficient muscle fibre formation and restoration of the ECM , vascularisation and inner - vation must be coordinated for effective and functional muscle regeneration . Strategies to enhance muscle repair in vivo can be broadly divided into three ( overlapping ) groups : ( i ) administration of factors to enhance myogenesis : such as IGF , VEGF , NO , Wnt7a [ 21 – 25 ] ; ( ii ) administration of cell types known to contribute to muscle regeneration : includ - ing satellite cells , pericytes and CD133 + cells [ 26 – 31 ] ; ( iii ) grafting of in vitro engineered mus - cle tissue [ 32 , 33 ] . Cells and factors are often encapsulated in 3D scaffolds for delivery , not only because the scaffold biomaterial can enhance the regenerative process , but it can also be used to control issues such as the dynamics of substance / cell release [ 26 ] . However , only engi - neering large skeletal muscle tissue in vitro would be a suitable approach to treat volumetric muscle loss , when the endogenous repair abilities are insufficient . Scaffolds for skeletal muscle engineering should ( i ) be biocompatible , ( ii ) support myoblast proliferation and differentiation , ( iii ) allow vascularisation and innervation and ( iv ) facilitate directional alignment for optimal force production , ( v ) be remodelled / degraded . Common scaffold biomaterials used in muscle engineering are collagen , hyaluronan , fibrin , alginate and polyethylene glycol [ 26 ] . In this study , we focus on collagen type I and fibrin , as well as a PEG - fibrinogen blend , since these biomaterials are proven to support myogenesis . Collagen is a major structural protein in skeletal muscle ECM , accounting for 1 – 10 % of dry muscle mass weight , and has been shown to support proliferation , differentiation and myotube formation of immortalised and primary murine myoblasts [ 34 – 42 ] . Fibrin is a biopolymer commonly used in tissue engineering [ 43 ] . It polymerises after thrombin mediated cleavage of Myogeniccell propertiesin 3D culture using different biomaterials PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0202574 September 17 , 2018 2 / 23 les Myopathies , King’s Health Partner’s Research and Development Challenge Fundand Muscular DystrophyUK .

JP , PSZ and NF declare no competinginterests . fibrinopeptides A and B , and modulation of thrombin amount allows tuning of physical prop - erties such as stiffness , pore and branch size [ 44 , 45 ] . Fibrin contains an abundance of cell attachment sites that interact with integrins and growth factors ( e . g . VEGF , bFGF2 ) [ 46 – 48 ] , it is biocompatible and degradable , and supports and improves myogenesis . Indeed , culture of Human Muscle Derived Cells ( MDCs ) in Fibrin gel produces an engineered skeletal muscle with structural resemblance to in vivo tissue [ 49 ] . Complementary , co - culture of rat primary embryonic motor neurons and neonatal myoblasts in three - dimensional Fibrin hydrogels allows formation of functional neuromuscular junctions [ 50 ] . Also using myogenic neonatal rat cells , a highly functional biometric muscle tissue has been engineered using Fibrin , com - plete with a populated satellite cell niche , the ability for vascular integration , and functional in vivo maturation [ 51 ] . Finally , PEG based hydrogels are also cytocompatible and tuneable in regard to mechanical properties [ 52 ] or adhesion sites . Photopolymerizable PEG - fibrinogen hydrogel is clinically approved and generates a favourable microenvironment by coupling nat - ural and synthetic features [ 53 ] . PEG - fibrinogen supports myogenic differentiation , cell sur - vival after transplantation and angiogenic infiltration in vitro and in vivo [ 54 , 55 ] . Murine mesoangioblasts overexpressing placenta derived growth factor ( PDGF ) encapsulated in a PEG - fibrinogen scaffold generated a functional artificial muscle [ 32 ] . Maturation of a construct can be achieved by non - directional mechanical or electrical stim - ulation [ 56 – 59 ] , but alignment is achieved when directional force is applied to the cell contain - ing scaffold , either actively or passively [ 34 , 60 , 61 ] . In this study , we employed a model originally used for engineered heart tissue ( EHT ) [ 60 ] . Polymerisation of the biomaterial between two anchor points , mimicking tendon anchorage , allows exertion of stress on the encapsulated cells , which is sufficient to promote alignment along the principle axis of force . This 3D culture system is simple , fast to setup , inexpensive and reproducible , making it a use - ful tool to screen myoblast behaviour in different 3 - dimensional biomaterials . This study aimed to examine in parallel the ability of collagen I , Fibrin and PEG - Fibrinogen in an in vitro 3D environment to support myogenesis from multiple myoblasts types including immortalized murine ( C2C12 ) [ 62 ] and human myoblasts ( C25Cl48 ) [ 63 ] , primary expanded murine satellites cells [ 64 ] , and satellite cells retained in their niche on a freshly isolated muscle fibre [ 65 ] . Materials and methods Biomaterials Rat collagen I . 80 % of type - I acid soluble collagen ( First link , UK : rat tail collagen1 : 2 . 05 mg / ml , cat : 60 - 30 - 810 ) was mixed on ice with 10 % of 10x MEM ( Gibco , UK ) . Collagen solution was neutralised with 1 M NaOH until colour change from yellow to bright pink . Neutralised solution was left on ice for 30 minutes , mixed with cells or muscle fibres and incubated at 37˚C for 30 – 60 mins to allow polymerisation ( Table 1 ) . Polymerised Collagen I at a concentration of 1 . 5 mg / ml has a stiffness of ~ 0 . 2 KPa [ 66 ] . Bovine fibrinogen . A stock solution of bovine fibrinogen ( Sigma : F8630 ) was prepared in sterile PBS ( 100 mg / ml ) and stored at - 20˚C . The stock solution was diluted to 5 mg / ml in pro - liferation medium . Fibrinogen was then mixed with cells or muscle fibres and Thrombin ( Tis - suco Duo 500 , Baxter , Illinois , USA ) was added on ice at a final concentration of 3 U / ml . The solution was quickly mixed and incubated at 37˚C for 30 – 60 mins to polymerise . To avoid Fibrin degradation , Aprotinin ( Sigma A1153 ) was added at a final concentration of 33 μg / ml in culture medium ( Table 1 ) . Polymerised Fibrin gel formed using 5 mg / ml of Fibrinogen and 3U / ml of Thrombin has a stiffness of ~ 1±0 . 1 KPa [ 67 ] [ 68 ] .

Polyethylene glycol Fibrinogen ( PEG - Fibrinogen ) . PEG - Fibrinogen ( 8 – 10 mg / ml ) was provided by Technion and stored at - 80˚C . Once defrosted , 0 . 1 % of Irgacure ( Sigma : 410896 ) ( stock solution : 10 % of Irgacure diluted in ethanol 70 % ) was added to the PEG - Fibrinogen . Cells or muscle fibres were mixed with the solution , transferred into a 96 well plate and cross - linked under an UV light ( 365 nm ) ( 3UV Lamp , 230 V , 50 Hz , ThermoFisher ) for 10 mins . Once polymerised , the gel was transferred to a 24 well plate , incubated in proliferation medium for several days and then switched to differentiation medium to induce myotube for - mation ( Table 1 ) . Polymerised PEG - Fibrinogen gel constituted with 7 mg / ml has a stiffness of ~ 0 . 125 KPa [ 69 ] . Cytotoxicity of UV light ( 365 nm ) used to initiate PEG - FN polymerisation was previously tested and found to be minimal [ 70 ] and the same parameters were used here [ 32 , 54 ] . 3D culture model This method was adapted from that used for cardiac muscle [ 60 ] . Collagen and Fibrin gels were polymerized between 2 silicon posts that mimic tendons ( Fig 1A ) [ 60 ] . The biomaterial ( 100 μl / gel ) was mixed with muscle cells ( around 0 . 5 million cells / gel ) or with muscle fibres ( 100 fibres / gel ) . The cell / biomaterial combination was then cast in a rectangular agarose - cast - ing mold ( 12 x 3 x 3 mm ) prepared in a standard 24 - well cell culture dish . A pair of flexible sili - cone posts supported by a silicone rack was immersed in the gel . After polymerization ( 30 – 60 mins at 37˚C ) , a 3D gel containing the cells is formed between the two silicone posts . When polymerised , the silicone rack holding the silicone posts is used to transfer the gel into a 24 - well tissue culture dish containing proliferation medium . In culture , cells remodel the gel and create tension that promotes alignment along the principal axis of force generated between the posts . To synchronise initiation of myogenic differentiation , proliferation medium was changed to differentiation medium . PEG - Fibrinogen did not polymerase between the two silicone posts and was instead poly - merised in 96 well plates ( Fig 1B ) . Once polymerised , the gel was transferred to a larger plate ( 24 well plates ) . In this context , no static strain is applied on this scaffold to promote myotubes alignment . The size of the gel after polymerisation was about 8 . 5 mm in length and 1 – 2 mm in diameter . Myoblast sources Murine C2C12 myoblasts . Immortalized murine C2C12 myoblasts [ 62 ] were cultured in proliferation medium ( DMEM supplemented with L - glutamine ( 2 mM ) , 10 % foetal bovine Table 1 . Biomaterials .

Primary murine expanded satellite cells . Adult C57BL10 mice ( 8 – 12 weeks old ) were killed by cervical dislocation and the Extensor digitorum longus muscle ( EDL ) was removed and digested in 0 . 2 % collagenase type 1 ( sigma ) for 2 h at 37˚C [ 71 ] . Satellite cell - derived myoblasts were allowed to migrate from isolated myofibres cultured in proliferation medium ( DMEM - GlutaMAX , 30 % FBS , 10 % HS , 1 % chick embryo extract ( CEE ) , 10 ng / ml bFGF , and 1 % penicillin – streptomycin ) on Matrigel .

Ethical statement Procedures were carried out under the Animals ( Scientific Procedures ) Act 1986 , and this study was approved by the King’s College London Ethical Review Process committee . EdU incorporation and immunolabeling EdU ( 10 μM , Invitrogen Life Technologies ) was added at a concentration of 10 μM for 2 hours , and the gels then fixed . 3D constructs were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde / PBS for 20 mins . EdU incorporation was revealed using a Click - iT EdU Imaging Kit ( Invitrogen Life Technologies ) as per manufacturer’s instructions .

Results Collagen I , Fibrin and PEG - Fibrinogen 3D scaffolds support myogenic progression in murine C2C12 myoblasts We first analysed myogenic progression of immortalized murine C2C12 myoblasts in col - lagen I , Fibrin and PEG - Fibrinogen 3D scaffolds . C2C12 have several advantages , includ - ing unlimited expansion and robust myotube formation in classic 2D cell culture , and are commonly used in muscle research . Immortalized C2C12 myoblasts were embedded in collagen I ( Fig 2A and 2D ) , Fibrin ( Fig 2B and 2E ) or PEG - Fibrinogen ( Fig 2C and 2F ) gels . Collagen I and Fibrin 3D scaffolds were then polymerised between two flexible sili - cone posts to create tension that promotes myoblast alignment and myotube formation ( Fig 1A ) . PEG - Fibrinogen could not be polymerased between the two silicone posts and was instead polymerised in 96 well plates ( Fig 1B ) . Myoblasts were cultured in prolifera - tion medium for 2 days ( Fig 2A – 2C ) and then switched to differentiation medium for another 3 days ( Fig 2D – 2F ) . After two days in proliferation medium , 3D scaffolds were fixed and immunolabelled for β - Tubulin to visualise the morphology of proliferating myoblasts ( Fig 2A – 2C ) . In collagen I ( Fig 2A ) and Fibrin ( Fig 2B ) gels , C2C12 myoblasts had an elongated shape and were generally aligned along the axis of force generated between the silicone posts . Alignment was more pro - nounced in Fibrin gels ( Fig 2B ) , compared to collagen ( Fig 2A ) . A compaction of collagen I and Fibrin gels was observed , since they are natural biomaterials that can be actively remod - elled by cells . Indeed , human myoblasts actively stiffen 3D Fibrin gels [ 67 ] . In PEG - Fibrinogen gels , C2C12 myoblasts also showed an elongated morphology but were randomly orientated ( Fig 2C ) . No obvious remodelling of the gel was observed . After 3 days in differentiation medium , scaffolds were fixed and immunolabelled for myo - sin heavy chain ( MyHC ) to monitor sarcomeric assembly in myotubes ( Fig 2D – 2F ) . Large multinucleated myotubes with parallel alignment were observed in both collagen I ( Fig 2D ) and Fibrin ( Fig 2E ) gels . A higher density of large myotubes was present in Fibrin gels . Multi - nucleated myotubes were also present in PEG - Fibrinogen scaffold ( Fig 2F ) but were thinner and not aligned . Absence of static tension , combined with reduced gel compaction that effec - tively decreased cell density , could explain this observation . However , reduction of cell prolif - eration and myotube differentiation due to the biochemical and biophysical nature of the PEG - Fibrinogen can not be excluded . These results show that all three biomaterials in a 3D culture support myogenic progression of C2C12 myoblasts , from cell attachment , elongation , proliferation , alignment to myogenic differentiation to fusion into multinucleated myotubes .

Immortal - ized human C25Cl48 myoblasts were embedded in collagen I ( Fig 3A and 3D ) , Fibrin ( Fig 3B and 3E ) or PEG - Fibrinogen ( Fig 3C and 3F ) , cultured in proliferation medium for 2 days ( Fig 3A – 3C ) and then switched to differentiation medium for 6 days ( Fig 3D – 3F ) . After two days in proliferation medium , cells were pulsed with the thymidine analogue 5 - Ethynyl - 2’deoxyuri - dine ( EdU ) for two hours and fixed , before being immunolabelled for β - Tubulin and EdU incorporation visualised using the Click - it Edu imaging kit . In collagen I ( Fig 3A ) and Fibrin ( Fig 3B ) gels , myoblasts had an elongated morphology and were aligned along the axis of force created by the silicone posts . Human myoblasts were denser and more compact in collagen I compared to Fibrin , suggesting that human myoblasts interact differently with these biomaterials . Both collagen I and Fibrin scaffolds promoted myoblast proliferation , as many had incorporated EdU ( Fig 3A and 3B ) . Human myoblasts elongated and proliferated in PEG - Fibrinogen , but appeared unable to remodel the biomate - rial , as no gel compaction was observed , with fewer elongated human myoblasts present ( Fig 3C ) . After 6 days in differentiation medium , gels were fixed and immunolabelled for MyHC to assess myotube formation ( Fig 3D – 3F ) . While many MyHC positive cells were present , only a few small myotubes were evident , showing the ability of all three biomaterials to support myo - blast differentiation but limited fusion . Myocytes / myotubes were aligned in collagen I ( Fig 3D ) and Fibrin ( Fig 3E ) , but not in PEG - Fibrinogen ( Fig 3F ) scaffolds . In Collagen gels how - ever , DAPI staining revealed many necrotic / apoptotic nuclei . To confirm the terminal differentiation state of the human cells , expression of Myosin Heavy chain ( MYH2 , 3 , 8 ) , the sarcomeric proteins Tropomyosin1 ( TPM1 ) and Actinin α 3 ( ACTN 3 ) and creatine kinase ( CKM ) were analysed by RT - qPCR ( Fig 3G – 3J ) . PEG - Fibrin gels were not analysed due to the inability to extract sufficient mRNA . Human myotubes in Fibrin gel had an increased expression of MYHC2 , 3 , 8 and ACTN3 compared to Collagen ( Fig 3G and 3H ) . As we are interested in biomaterials with potential clinical application , we did not formally evaluate Matrigel , since it is derived from Engelbreth - Holm - Swarm mouse sarcomas . However , Matrigel is widely used in the culture of myoblasts and to improve myotube forma - tion , and so we did use Matrigel as a positive control . Matrigel was added to the Fibrin gel ( 10 % : final concentration of 1mg / ml ) , which led to increased expression of MYHC2 , 3 , 8 , TPM1 , ACTN 3 and CKM compared to Collagen 1 ( Fig 3G – 3J ) . The dimensions of Collagen and Fibrin gels with embedded human myoblasts were also analysed at 0 , 3 and 7 days of differentiation . Lengths of the 3D scaffolds were unchanged ( data not shown ) . The molds were 2 . 5 mm wide , and so the 3D cultures began at this width , but Collagen gels with human myoblasts then became more compact ( width of 1 . 48±0 . 02 mm ) compared to Fibrin gels ( 2 . 30±0 . 08 mm ) after the 2 day proliferation phase , when measured at Day 0 ( Parts A and B of S1 Fig ) . Between day 0 and day 7 though , Fibrin gels further com - pacted during myogenic differentiation ( Part B of S1 Fig ) . Addition of 10 % Matrigel made created by the silicone posts and gel compaction was observed . In PEG - Fibrinogen gels ( C ) , C2C12 myoblasts present randomly orientated membrane projections and no gel compaction was observed . After 3 days in differentiation medium , large parallel myotubes ( arrowed ) were observed in Collagen I ( D ) and Fibrin ( E ) gels . Thinner and randomly orientated myotubes were present in PEG - Fibrinogen scaffold ( F ) . Scale bar represents 100 μm .

Collagen I , Fibrin and PEG - Fibrinogen 3D scaffolds support limited differentiation of expanded primary murine satellite cells We next analysed the behaviour of ex vivo expanded primary murine satellite cells , which are a more biologically pertinent model compared to immortalized C2C12 . Satellite cells were iso - lated from the EDL muscle and expanded ex vivo on Matrigel for five days to obtain sufficient cells . Expanded primary satellite cell - derived myoblasts were embedded in collagen I ( Fig 4A and 4D ) , Fibrin ( Fig 4B and 4E ) or PEG - Fibrinogen ( Fig 4C and 4F ) , cultured in proliferation medium for 4 days ( Fig 4A – 4C ) and then switched to differentiation medium for 10 days ( Fig 4D – 4F ) . Proliferating myoblasts were immunolabelled for β - Tubulin ( Fig 4A – 4C ) and myo - tubes for Desmin , a muscle specific intermediate filament protein ( Fig 4D – 4F ) . After 4 days in proliferation medium ( Fig 4A , 4B and 4C ) most satellite cells were round , with only a few showing an elongated morphology . The inability of satellite cells to elongate could be an issue of cell - scaffold interaction and initial adhesion within the 3D environment . After ten days in differentiation medium , no myotubes were observed in collagen I ( Fig 4D ) and PEG - Fibrino - gen scaffolds ( Fig 4F ) and only few thin myotubes were detected in Fibrin gels ( arrow in Fig 4E ) . To confirm terminal differentiation of expanded satellite cells embedded in 3D gels , expres - sion of Myh1 , Actn3 , Tpm1 , and Ckm was again analysed by RT - qPCR ( Fig 4G – 4J ) . PEG - Fi - brin gels were not analysed due to the inability to extract enough mRNA for the analysis . Presence of all terminal differentiation markers was confirmed in all the biomaterials , but sur - prisingly compared to Collagen gels , satellite cells in Fibrin presented significantly less expres - sion of Tpm1 and Ckm ( Fig 4I and 4J ) . To determine if the lack of myogenic differentiation of ex vivo expanded primary murine satellite cells was due to the biomaterials , we added Matrigel ( 10 % ) into Fibrin gel as a positive control , since it is routinely used to enhance myotube formation . After only 2 days in differen - tiation medium , we observed robust spontaneous contraction ( S1 Movie ) in Fibrin / Matrigel hybrid gels that was not observed in Fibrin gels ( S2 Movie ) . This confirmed that ex vivo expanded primary murine satellite cells were capable of robust differentiation and highlights the crucial function of ECM / growth factors supplied by Matrigel for satellite cell function in a 3D environment . Interestingly , though expanded satellite cells in Fibrin / Matrigel hybrid gels Fig 3 . Myogenic progression of immortalized human myoblasts in different 3D biomaterial scaffolds in vitro . Immortalized human myoblasts C25Cl48 were embedded in collagen I ( 500 000 cells / 100 μl : A and D ) , Fibrin ( 500 000 cells / 100 μl : B and E ) or PEG - Fibrinogen ( 500 000 cells / 100 μl : C and F ) , cultured in proliferation medium for 2 days ( A - C ) and then switched to differentiation medium for 6 days ( D - F ) . After 2 days in proliferation medium , cells were pulsed with the thymidine analogue 5 - Ethynyl - 2’deoxyuridine ( EdU ) for 2 hours and then fixed , before EdU incorporation was visualised and myoblasts immunolabelled for β - Tubulin and nuclei counterstained with DAPI . After 6 days in differentiation medium , cells were fixed and immunolabelled for myosin heavy chain ( MyHC ) to visualise myotubes and counterstained with DAPI . Proliferating EdU positive ( arrow - heads ) and β - Tubulin myoblasts were aligned in collagen I ( A ) and Fibrin ( B ) gels but randomly orientated in PEG - Fibrinogen scaffold ( C ) . After 6 days in differentiation medium many MyHC positive cells were present but only a few small myotubes were detected in collagen I ( D ) or Fibrin ( E ) gels .

Dimensions of PEG - FN , Collagen and Fibrin gels were analysed during proliferation and differentiation of expanded satellite cells ( S2 Fig ) . Diameter of the PEG - FN gels did not change during satellite cell proliferation but slightly increased during their differentiation ( Part A of S2 Fig ) . Collagen gel width was unchanged under either satellite cell proliferation or differenti - ation conditions ( Part B of S2 Fig ) . However , the width of Fibrin gels reduced during prolifera - tion ( from 2 . 55±0 . 05 mm to 1 . 92±0 . 02 mm ) and even further during differentiation ( 1 . 55 ±0 . 03 mm after 2 days and 1 . 35±0 . 05 mm at day 3 ) ( Part C of S2 Fig ) , suggesting a strong remodelling of Fibrin by satellite cells . Robust and functional myogenic differentiation of satellite cells delivered in their niche on a myofibre in 3D scaffolds In vivo transplantation of freshly isolated satellite cells while still in their niche on a muscle fibre , vastly improves their regenerative potential [ 6 ] . To test if the regenerative potential of satellite cells could be preserved in an in vitro 3D environment , we embedded freshly isolated myofibres in 3D scaffolds . 100 freshly isolated Soleus myofibres were embedded in 100 μl of collagen I ( Fig 5A – 5D ) , Fibrin ( Fig 5E – 5H ) or PEG - Fibrinogen ( Fig 5I – 5L ) , the gels polymer - ised and then cultured in proliferation medium for 1 ( Fig 5A , 5E and 5I ) , 3 ( Fig 5B , 5F and 5J ) or 6 ( Fig 5C , 5G and 5K ) days . After 10 days in proliferation medium , scaffolds were switched to differentiation medium for 3 days ( Fig 5D , 5H and 5L ) . After 1 day in proliferation medium , intact myofibres were present ( Fig 5A , 5E and 5I ) , but more hypercontracted myofibres were observed in PEG - Fibrinogen ( Fig 5I ) . In all biomaterial scaffolds , after 3 days in proliferation medium , activated satellite cells were observed migrating from their myofibre niche into the 3D matrix ( Fig 5B , 5F and 5J ) . After 6 days , satellite cell - derived myoblasts were still proliferating , indicated by an increased number of cells present at the surface of the myofibres and inside the biomaterial gels ( Fig 5C , 5G and 5K ) . After 10 days in proliferation medium followed by 3 days in differentiation medium , multinucleated myofi - bres were observed ( Fig 5D , 5H and 5L ) . The static force exerted on the collagen I ( Fig 5D ) and Fibrin ( Fig 5H ) gels facilitated parallel alignment of myotubes . In absence of tension in the PEG - Fibrinogen scaffold , myotubes were randomly orientated ( Fig 5L ) . To evaluate myogenic differentiation of satellite cells delivered in their niche on a myofibre , we isolated Soleus myofibres from the 3F - nlacZ - E mouse : transgenic for a construct with regu - latory elements of the myosin light chain ( MLC ) 1 / 3F gene driving nlacZ reporter gene expres - sion in myonuclei [ 72 ] . X - gal staining of satellite cells isolated from the 3F - nlacZ - E mouse allows high resolution detection of their differentiated progeny , with β - galactosidase activity only in myonuclei . Freshly isolated Soleus myofibres from 3F - nlacZ - E mice were embedded in collagen I ( Fig 5M ) , Fibrin ( Fig 5N ) or PEG - Fibrinogen ( Fig 5O ) gels , incubated in prolifera - tion medium for 10 days and then switched to differentiation medium for 3 days . Biomaterial gels were then fixed and stained in X - gal solution to detect transgenic β - galactosidase activity in myonuclei ( Fig 5M – 5O ) . More myonuclei were stained , and more parallel aligned myotubes in differentiation medium , no myotubes were observed in collagen I ( D ) or PEG - Fibrinogen scaffolds ( F ) and only a few thin myotubes were present in Fibrin gel ( arrow in E ) .

Importantly , myotubes formed from satellite cells delivered in their niche in all three 3D biomaterial gels showed spontaneous contraction , confirming their state of maturation and functionality ( collagen I : S3 Movie ; Fibrin : S4 Movie and PEG - Fibrinogen : S5 Movie ) . Move - ment and frequency of myotube contraction was higher in Fibrin scaffolds compared to colla - gen I scaffolds . Interestingly , multinucleated and contractile myotubes could be maintained for up to two months in 3D Fibrin gels . Thus , delivery of satellite cells in their niche on freshly isolated myofibres allows for robust proliferation and formation of multinucleated , mature and functional myotubes in a 3D environment with all three biomaterials tested . Discussion In this study , we evaluated in parallel the ability of collagen I , Fibrin and PEG - Fibrinogen 3D scaffolds to support proliferation and myogenic differentiation of different types of muscle cells in vitro . The 3D culture system was originally developed for engineered heart tissue by embedding cardiomyocytes in Fibrin [ 68 ] . Here , we used this system for engineering skeletal muscle tissue by embedding myoblasts in collagen I and Fibrin gels . Polymerisation of Fibrin was stable , however with collagen I after polymerisation , a detachment from one of the flexible silicone posts was sometimes observed . We also tried to polymerise PEG - Fibrinogen between the two silicone posts using UV light . However , no polymerisation was observed probably due to an obstruction of the UV light by the silicone rack holding the posts . This in vitro 3D culture system involves securing the biomaterial scaffold between two flexi - ble silicone posts that mimic tendons , and so create predictable lines of tension [ 60 ] . Using this system , we observed an alignment of cells along the principal axis of force in collagen I and Fibrin gels . Such static force allows formation of parallel , aligned myotubes that are char - acteristic of native skeletal muscle and essential to efficiently generate force . Therefore , this simple 3D system represents a suitable in vitro model to analyse myogenesis , by allowing for - mation of aligned multinucleated and mature myotubes . Myofibre diameter and force produc - tion of in vitro - engineered skeletal muscle are known to be lower compared to native skeletal muscle and will be difficult to reach in vitro without more complex , multi - lineage culture to induce vascularisation and innervation [ 33 , 51 ] . Static force during 3D culture of immortalized human C25Cl48 myoblasts produced myo - blast and myotube alignment . However , compared to immortalized murine C2C12 , only a moderate myotube formation was observed and no obvious difference was observed between collagen I and Fibrin gel . Human myoblasts were unable to contract spontaneously , and we did not try mechanical or electrical stimuli in this 3D system , that could improve myotube for - mation and maintenance . Alternatively , drugs can be added in the culture medium to stimu - lated myotube formation ( e . g . HGF , FGF , IGF - 1 , DEX ) [ 23 ] or muscle contraction ( e . g . caffeine ) [ 74 ] . Similarly , co - culture with fibroblasts can also improve myotube formation [ 75 ] . Finally , no other components were added routinely to the biomaterials that were tested , except Matrigel as a positive control , which contains the main component of the muscle stem cells niche ( e . g . laminin ) [ 35 ] . Other human myoblast clones may be able to differentiate better in this system though . Using ex vivo expanded murine satellite cells with the 3D biomaterials , we observed only a moderate ability of the cells to fuse to form multinucleated myotubes . However , addition of growth factor reduced Matrigel to the Fibrin gel was able to enhance greatly the formation of contractile myotubes . Moreover , culture of satellite cells in their niche on freshly isolated myo - fibres in these 3D gels promoted the expansion of satellite cell - derived myoblasts and their Myogeniccell propertiesin 3D culture using different biomaterials PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0202574 September 17 , 2018 15 / 23 robust differentiation and fusion into multinucleated , mature and contractile myofibres : show - ing greater regenerative capacity , in agreement with in vivo data [ 6 , 10 – 12 , 76 ] . This highlights the importance of biochemical and biophysical cues supplied by the native niche to maintain the regenerative potential of muscle stem cells [ 77 ] . Encouragingly then , primary murine satel - lite cells on a myofibre , compared to expanded satellite cells , behave in a similar way in our in vitro 3D culture system as when grafted in vivo . Classic 2D culture of myoblasts is commonly used due to multiple advantages , such as no need for specific or complex equipment , fewer cells required , and fast , easy and reproducible quantification of gene expression by quantitative RT - qPCR and immunolabelling . However , in the absence of mechanical / electrical stimulation , critical for muscle cell viability [ 78 ] , myo - tubes in 2D cell culture can only usually be maintained for few days as they start to spontane - ously contract and soon detach from the culture surface . Using the 3D culture system however , with approximately 100 freshly isolated Soleus fibres ( so only around 2500 satellite cells [ 79 ] ) , we obtained multinucleated and contractile myofibres with parallel alignment that generated force for a long period . Indeed , multinucleated and contractile myotubes were maintained for up to two months in 3D Fibrin gels . The spontaneous muscle contraction observed possibly plays a functional role in the integrity and maintenance of in vitro engi - neered muscle [ 78 ] . Apart from the influence on satellite cell function of remaining in their native niche , the isolated myofibres themselves could provide structural support and produce factors ( e . g . IGF - 1 ) [ 80 ] that could promote myotube formation . In addition , some residual fibroblasts may be present , which could also enhance differentiation [ 75 , 81 , 82 ] . This simple 3D system allows spontaneous contraction of myotubes without any external electrical stimulation or addition of molecules to induce muscle contraction . Therefore , this 3D in vitro culture system of myofi - bres could be a useful tool to analyse growth , maturation or muscle contraction in different contexts . A video optical recording system developed for cardiomyocytes [ 68 ] will be a valuable tool to automatically evaluate the contractile activity of myotubes . The system could also be used to test drugs that could affect muscle mass ( atrophy / hypertrophy ) over a longer period . In vitro , culture of neonatal rat myogenic cells embedded in Fibrin can generate a functional muscle with resident satellite cells that allow muscle regeneration in vitro [ 51 ] . It will also be interest - ing to check if our system also allows the formation of a new satellite cells niche and supports the self - renewal of satellite cells . However , in our hands , sufficient optical resolution could not be obtained to investigate this . The 3D PEG - Fibrinogen scaffold allows myotube formation of murine myoblasts but myo - tubes were not aligned and smaller compared with collagen I and Fibrin gels . Generally , we observed less remodelling of the PEG - Fibrinogen gel and more rounded cells inside the matrix . These results suggest that myoblasts have a reduced adhesion with the biosynthetic matrix and are less able to remodel the matrix . However , at the same time , Fibrin gels require stabilisation with Aprotinin to prevent degradation by cells , and the higher stability of the PEG - Fibrinogen could provide useful in certain scenarios . PEG - Fibrinogen was not polymerised between the two silicone posts , but in a 96 well plate . The resulting shape of PEG - Fibrinogen gels most likely influenced the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen . Moreover , the absence of static force applied to the scaffold likely explains lack of myotube alignment and their reduced size . In vivo , trans - plantation of mesoangioblasts in PEG - Fibrinogen generated a complete and functional ( vascu - larised , innervated and contractile ) muscle [ 32 ] . Using freshly isolated murine muscle fibres embedded in PEG - Fibrinogen we also observed a robust formation of multinucleated and con - tractile myotubes .

In conclusion , we show that biomaterials collagen I , Fibrin and PEG - Fibrinogen supported myoblast proliferation and differentiation . However , our study revealed that subtle differences exist between the way the same cell type interacts with different biomaterials , or how different cell types interact with the same material . Additionally , we highlight how important the cell source is : a hundred freshly transplanted soleus fibres with ~ 2500 satellite cells [ 79 ] greatly out - performed directly embedding 500 000 expanded satellite cell - derived myoblasts .
