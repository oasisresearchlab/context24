Cerione , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY , and accepted by the Editorial Board December 27 , 2012 ( received for review July 19 , 2012 ) The G - protein – mediated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) – RhoGTPasesignalingaxishasbeenimplicatedinhumanpath - ophysiology and is a potential therapeutic target . By virtual screen - ing of chemicals that ﬁ t into a surface groove of the DH - PH domain of LARG , a G - protein – regulated Rho GEF involved in RhoA activa - tion , and subsequent validations in biochemical assays , we have identi ﬁ ed a class of chemical inhibitors represented by Y16 that are active in speci ﬁ cally inhibiting LARG binding to RhoA . Y16 binds to the junction site of the DH - PH domains of LARG with a ∼ 80 nM K d and suppresses LARG catalyzed RhoA activation dose dependently . ItisactiveinblockingtheinteractionofLARGandrelatedG - protein – coupled Rho GEFs with RhoA without a detectable effect on other DBL family Rho GEFs , Rho effectors , or a RhoGAP . In cells , Y16 se - lectively inhibits serum - induced RhoA activity and RhoA - mediated signaling , effectsthat can be rescued by a constitutivelyactiveRhoA or ROCK mutant . By suppressing RhoA activity , Y16 inhibits mam - mary sphere formation of MCF7 breast cancer cells but does not affect the nontransforming MCF10A cells . Signi ﬁ cantly , Y16 works synergistically with Rhosin / G04 , a Rho GTPase activation site inhib - itor , in inhibiting LARG – RhoA interaction , RhoA activation , and RhoA - mediated signaling functions . Thus , our studies show that Rho GEFs can serve as selective targets of small chemicals and pres - ent a strategy of dual inhibition of the enzyme – substrate pair of GEF – RhoA at their binding interface that leads to enhanced ef ﬁ cacy and speci ﬁ city . R ho family GTPases are intracellular signaling molecules that regulate cytoskeleton organization , gene expression , cell cycle progression , cell motility , and other cellular processes ( 1 – 4 ) . The activities of many Rho family members hinge upon a delicate balance between the GTP - bound , active state and the GDP - bound , inactive state , which is subject to tight regulation in cells in response to physiologic and pathologic signals . Rho guanine nu - cleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) represent the major class of activating enzymes of Rho GTPases by serving to relay a variety of signals to catalyze GDP / GTP exchange of speci ﬁ c Rho GTPases . To date , > 80 RhoGEFs have been discovered that regulate the activities of over a dozen Rho GTPases in mammals ( 5 ) . The overabundance of RhoGEFs vs . Rho GTPase substrates allows the GEFs to function in a tissue / cell type - and signaling pathway - speci ﬁ c manner , even though multiple RhoGEFs may possess the activating potential for a given Rho GTPase . Consistent with a broad association of abnormal Rho GTPase activities in human cancers , a number of RhoGEFs have been reported to be overexpressed and / or hyperactivated in cancer cells , and they may be causal for tumor cell invasion and / or pro - liferation ( 6 ) . The DH - PH domains shared among the DBL RhoGEF family , which constitutes the major class of RhoGEFs ( 7 ) , have been characterized as the critical binding and catalytic motif required for Rho GTPase activation , and in - depth knowl - edge of the mechanism of DH - PH – mediated GEF reaction has been obtained in the last two decades ( 8 – 10 ) . Among the DBL - like RhoGEFs , the heterotrimeric G - protein – regulated LARG , p115RhoGEF , and PDZRhoGEF form a unique RhoGEF sub - family that transduce signals from G α 12 / 13 - coupled chemokine or mitogen receptors to RhoA through their RGS and DH - PH domains ( 11 – 15 ) . The G α 12 / 13 – RhoGEF – RhoA signaling cascade has been proposed as a useful target in cancer or neuro - logic diseases ( 16 ) . Small - molecule chemicals , as a major structural class of drugs , are broadly pursued in targeting oncoproteins and their signaling pathways . However , only proteins containing suitable hydrophobic pockets are considered druggable ( 17 – 20 ) , which signi ﬁ cantly limits the scope of drug discovery effort . In the G α 12 / 13 – Rho - GEF – RhoA signaling cascade , the G proteins and Rho GTPases are considered dif ﬁ cult to target in part because they have globular structures with limited druggable surface areas . Here , we present evidence that G - protein – coupled RhoGEFs constitute valid tar - gets and can be speci ﬁ cally targeted at the catalytic site of DH - PH domains by chemical compounds . Furthermore , we demonstrate a strategy to target RhoA signaling by dual inhibitors of the GEF – RhoA pair of enzyme – substrate interface , to achieve improved ef ﬁ cacy and speci ﬁ city , expanding the traditional “ one target , one drug ” approach in rational drug design . Results Targeting the RhoA Interactive Site of LARG via Virtual Screening . We used data from the crystal structures of LARG – RhoA com - plex ( 21 ) [ Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ID code 1X86 ] to identify a relatively stable interaction site ( low β factor in the crystal structure ) . At this interaction site , RhoA protrudes into a con - cavity on the surface of LARG between residues N975 and R986 ; therefore , we hypothesized that a small molecule that bound in that concavity would reduce or prevent RhoA binding to LARG . From the docking screen of more than 4 million compounds in the ZINC library ( 22 , 23 ) , the top scoring 49 chemicals predicted to bind to the LARG binding concavity were tested for their ability to inhibit the binding interaction between the DH - PH domain module of LARG and RhoA . Puri ﬁ ed DH - PH domains of LARG , expressed as the ( His ) 6 - tagged proteins in Escherichia coli , were incubated with RhoA in the presence of a given compound at 100 μ M concentration . Among the compounds tested , Y16 , which is predicted to dock at the DH - PH junction of LARG ( Fig . 1 A and B ) , showed an activity in suppressing LARG binding to RhoA ( Fig . 1 C and Table S1 ) . Y16 was effective in inhibiting LARG binding to RhoA at 10 μ M concentration under the pull - down assay conditions , and the activity was dose dependent ( Fig . 1 D ) . Y16 thus represents a candidate inhibitor of the LARG interactive site with RhoA . Compound Y16 and Its Analogs Are a Class of Inhibitors of G - Protein – Coupled RhoGEFs . To examine the speci ﬁ city of Y16 among RhoA interactive molecules , we have carried out additional biochemical tests of binding interaction of RhoA with its GEFs , effectors , and RhoGAP in the present of Y16 .

Furthermore , Y16 did not interfere with the binding of Cdc42 and Rac1 to their re - spective GEFs , intersectin and TrioN , respectively , nor RhoA binding with its effector / GAP molecules ROCKII , mDia , PKN , and p190RhoGAP ( Fig . 1 F and Fig . S1 ) . These results provide bio - chemical evidence that Y16 is a selective inhibitor of the LARG - related G - protein – coupled RhoGEFs , capable of inhibiting the RhoGEF – RhoA interaction . A preliminary structure – activity re - lationship study of structural analogs of Y16 , all bearing a phenyl - pyrazolidine scaffold , by testing their respective activity in inhibiting LARG binding to RhoA in vitro , found a very narrow SAR with Y16 as the most potent analog ( Table S2 ) .

Biochemical Characterization of Y16 Interaction with LARG . To de ﬁ ne the mechanism of Y16 action , we have sought to determine the binding constant of Y16 to LARG , examine its effect on LARG - mediated GEF reaction , and map the possible site of Y16 in - teraction with LARG . First , a microscale thermophoresis analysis , which allows a sensitive detection of small - molecule binding to a protein target ( 24 ) , was carried out by titrating the chemical to puri ﬁ ed LARG DH - PH protein . This assay shows that Y16 binds to this catalytic fragment of LARG with a K d of ∼ 76 ± 8 nM ( Fig . 2 A ) . As controls , Y16 does not bind to TrioN ( a GEF for Rac1 / RhoG ) or Intersectin ( a GEF for Cdc42 ) ( Fig . S2 ) . Second , to examine whether Y16 could inhibit RhoGEF - catalyzed guanine nucleotide - exchange reaction of RhoA , a GDP / GTP exchange assay was performed in the presence or absence of Y16 . Y16 was able to inhibit the GDP dissociation from RhoA catalyzed by LARG dose dependently without affecting the GEF reactions of Rac1 and Cdc42 catalyzed by TrioN and Intersectin , respectively ( Fig . 2 B and Fig . S2 ) . Third , to examine the structural residues of LARG involved in Y16 binding , LARG point mutants bearing Ala mutation around the predicted docking sites , i . e . , E982 , K979 , and N983 , of LARG , were tested for their binding af ﬁ nities to Y16 . Two of these residues are conserved among three G - protein – coupled RhoGEFs , but are mostly divergent from other DBL family RhoGEFs ( Fig . 2 C ) . The N983A mutant lost the binding ability to Y16 with a K d > 500 μ M , whereas the K979A and E982A mutants showed a reduced af ﬁ nity with K d values of 0 . 47 and 2 . 1 μ M , respectively ( Fig . 2 D ) . As a control , the V1099A mutant of LARG , a mutant bearing a mutation outside the predicted docking pocket , was not affected in Y16 binding ( K d = 79 ± 49 nM ) . Overall , these results suggest a relative tight binding of Y16 to the unique site in the DH - PH domains of LARG to impinge on the GEF activation reaction of the RhoA substrate . Y16 Speci ﬁ cally Inhibits RhoA Activity in Cells . To examine whether the lead RhoGEF inhibitor Y16 is effective in speci ﬁ cally sup - pressing RhoA activity in cells , ﬁ broblast cells grown in serum - free media were treated with Y16 in different concentrations , followed by stimulation with 10 % ( vol / vol ) calf serum . As shown in Fig . 3 A , Y16 could inhibit RhoA - GTP formation induced by serum dose dependently and was speci ﬁ c for RhoA because it did not affect the activities of Cdc42 and Rac1 in the same cells ( Fig . 3 B ) . In addition , Y16 ef ﬁ ciently inhibited serum or SDF - 1 α – induced phospho - MLC and phospho - FAK formation ( Fig . 3 C ) , which are downstream of RhoA . Previously , it has been established that the serum component lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) elicits a signaling cascade through G - protein – coupled RhoGEFs and RhoA to regulated cell cytoskeleton organizations ( 1 – 3 ) . To further eval - uate the ability of Y16 to inhibit RhoA - mediated cell functions , we next examined actin cytoskeleton structures of cells stimulated by serum or LPA in the absence or presence of Y16 . Fig . 3 D shows that , in the presence of Y16 , both stress ﬁ ber and focal complex of the cells were signi ﬁ cantly reduced , whereas Fig . S3 shows that the Rac1 - mediated lamellipodia and Cdc42 - mediated ﬁ lapodia under the stimulation by PDGF and Bradykinin , respectively , were not affected . Given the implicated role of RhoA in actin cytoskeleton Fig . 3 . Cellular ef ﬁ cacy and speci ﬁ city of Y16 in sup - pressing RhoA activity . ( A and B ) NIH 3T3 cells were treated with Y16 at the indicated concentrations for 24 h in serum - free media . Cells were subsequently stimulated with 10 % calf serum for 15 min and were subjected to GST - Rhotekin or GST - PAK1 effector domain pull - down assays , and the activities of RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 were examined . Rela - tive amounts of GTP - bound form of the GTPases were quanti ﬁ ed by densitometry measurements and normalized to those of the unstimulated cells . ( C ) Y16 inhibited the serum or / and SDF - 1 α – induced phospho - MLC and phospho - FAK activities . Western blots are of p - MLC and p - FAK and relevant controls of NIH 3T3 cells treated with Y16 at in - dicated concentrations in serum - free media and sub - sequently stimulated by 10 % calf serum or / and 100 ng / mL SDF1 - α for 10 min . ( D ) The effect of Y16 on cell stress ﬁ ber and focal complex was assessed in Swiss 3T3 cells . Cells were treated with 30 μ M Y16 in serum - free media , sub - sequently stimulated with 10 % calf serum for 10 min , and stained with rhodamine – phalloidin for F - actin and anti - vinculin for focal adhesion complexes . Images shown are representative of more than 100 cells examined . ( E ) Y16 does not affect the constitutively active RhoA Q63L mu - tant - induced actin stress ﬁ ber or focal adhesion formation . NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with constitutively active RhoA Q63L mutant or a control vector and subsequently were grown on tissue culture dish in a serum - free media in the presence of 50 μ M Y16 . After 24 - h starvation , cells were stimulated with 10 % calf serum for 30 min and were stained with rhodamine – phalloidin to reveal F - actin struc - ture and anti - vinculin antibody for focal adhesion . Shang et al . PNAS | February 19 , 2013 | vol . 110 | no . 8 | 3157 P H A R M A C O L O G Y organization and adhesion ( 1 – 3 ) , these results demonstrate that Y16 is active in speci ﬁ cally inhibiting cellular RhoA - GTP and RhoA - mediated signaling function . To further examine the speci ﬁ city of Y16 in cells , we put Y16 to a test of cells expressing constitutively active RhoA or ROCKII mutant that produces F - actin – based responses independent of en - dogenous RhoGEF activity . As shown in Fig . 3 E and Fig . S4 , Y16 did not alter actin stress ﬁ ber or focal adhesion complex formation induced by a constitutively active RhoA mutant Q63L , or a consti - tutively active ROCKII . Furthermore , although Y16 was capable of inhibiting serum - induced phospho - MLC formation , an event me - diated by RhoA activity in NIH 3T3 cells ( Fig . 3 C ) , it did not in - terfere with phosphor - MLC in cells overexpressing RhoA Q63L mutant ( Fig . S5 ) . Under the assay conditions , Y16 appeared to be noncytotoxic as it did not affect the survival status of the cells ( Fig . S6 ) . These results provide further evidence that the effect of Y16 toward GEF - RhoA signaling is likely speci ﬁ c in cells . Y16 Acts Synergistically with Rhosin / G04 in Inhibiting LARG – RhoA Interaction and RhoA Activity . We previously identi ﬁ ed a chem - ical compound , Rhosin / G04 , that speci ﬁ cally binds to RhoA protein and inhibits RhoA activity in diverse physiological and pathological systems ( 25 ) . Because Rhosin / G04 speci ﬁ cally inter - acts with RhoA at the GEF recognition site while Y16 binds to LARG at the RhoA recognition site , we further hypothesized that dual targeting by the two inhibitors may have a synergistic effect on the GEF – RhoA interaction as they act on the same interface of GEF – RhoA binding , and consequently , on RhoA activity and signaling functions . We thus examined the in vitro and cellular effects when Rhosin / G04 and Y16 were used together . First , when Rhosin / G04 and Y16 were combined together , the working con - centrations required for effective inhibition of RhoA binding to LARG were signi ﬁ cantly decreased ( IC 50 of ∼ 1 μ M compared with ∼ 10 and ∼ 5 μ M of G04 or Y16 alone , respectively ) ( Fig . 4 A ) , suggesting that Rhosin / G04 and Y16 can synergistically inhibit RhoA – LARG binding interaction . Second , applying Rhosin / G04 and Y16 together to NIH 3T3 cells potently inhibited RhoA ac - tivity ( Fig . 4 B ) . At 2 . 5 μ M each , Rhosin and Y16 inhibited ∼ 50 % RhoA - GTP content , and at 5 μ M each ∼ 80 % RhoA - GTP stimu - lated by serum , which were much more potent than the effect of Rhosin / G04 or Y16 acting alone ( ∼ 80 % inhibition at 30 μ M ) . Even under a higher concentration of Y16 and Rhosin / G04 combination ( 50 μ M each ) when endogenous RhoA - GTP content was effec - tively suppressed , no effect on Rac1 - GTP or Cdc42 - GTP content in cells was observed ( Fig . 4 C ) , suggesting a high degree of speci - ﬁ city of the inhibitors . Importantly , the Rhosin / G04 and Y16 combination was able to completely abolish the RhoA - medicated cell stress ﬁ ber formation at 2 . 5 μ M concentration of each of the inhibitors , whereas it required over 10 μ M of Rhosin / G04 or Y16 alone to show such a cellular effect ( Fig . 4 D ) . These results suggest that Y16 and Rhosin / G04 can act synergistically to inhibit RhoA activity . Y16 Effectively Inhibits the Growth , Migration , and Invasion Activities of Breast Cancer Cells . Aberrant RhoGEF activity has been asso - ciated with cancer cell hyperproliferative , migration , and invasive characteristics ( 6 , 7 ) . Next , we investigated the effect of Y16 on the growth , migration , and invasion , as well as mammosphere for - mation , activities of breast cancer cells , properties associated with tumorigenic potential ( 26 ) . Y16 could signi ﬁ cantly inhibit MCF7 breast cancer cell growth , migration , and invasion , and the RhoA inhibitor Rosin / G04 ( Fig . 5 A – C ) . The Y16 - treated MCF7 cells also yielded smaller size and reduced number of mammospheres dose dependently ( Fig . 5 E ) . Thus , Y16 is capable of suppressing breast cancer cell behaviors . To examine whether Y16 could worked synergistically with Rhosin / G04 to more effectively suppress cancer cell activities , we examined a combination of Y16 with Rhosin / G04 at micromolar Fig . 4 .

( B ) Effects of Y16 , G04 , or G04 + Y16 combination in suppressing RhoA activity in NIH 3T3 cells . NIH 3T3 cells were treated with Y16 , G04 , or G04 + Y16 combination at the indicated con - centrations for 24 h in serum - free media . Cells were sub - sequently stimulated with 10 % calf serum for 15 min and were subjected to GST - Rhotekin effector domain pull - down assays , and the activities of RhoA were examined . Relative amounts of GTP - bound form of the GTPases were quanti - ﬁ ed by densitometry measurements and normalized to those of the unstimulated cells . ( C ) Effect of Y16 , G04 , or G04 + Y16 combination on Cdc42 and Rac1 activities . NIH 3T3 cells were treated with Y16 , G04 , or G04 + Y16 combi - nation at the indicated concentrations for 24 h in serum - free media . Cells were subsequently stimulated with 10 % calf serum for 15 min and were subjected to GST - Rhotekin and GST - PAK1 effector domain pull - down assays , and the activities of RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 were examined . Rela - tive amounts of GTP - bound form of the GTPases were quanti ﬁ ed by densitometry measurements and normalized to those of the nontreated cells . ( D ) Y16 , G04 , or G04 + Y16 combination selectively blocks cellular response to LPA - stimulated actin stress ﬁ ber formation . NIH 3T3 cells were treated with Y16 , G04 , or G04 + Y16 combination of the indicated concentrations in serum - free DMEM medium prior to stimulation with LPA ( 20 ng / mL ) for 10 min . The cells were stained with rhodamine – phalloidin to reveal F - actin structures . 3158 | www . pnas . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1073 / pnas . 1212324110 Shang et al . working concentrations . Combined treatment of Y16 and Rhosin / G04 at 5 μ M each could effectively inhibit cell growth , migration , invasion , and mammosphere formation activities ( Fig . 5 A – E and Fig . S7 ) , showing a clear synergy over the effects when each in - hibitor was used alone . Accompanying the manifested cell activity inhibitions , RhoA - GTP and downstream signaling of RhoA , measured by p - MLC level , showed a dose - dependent reduction in the Rhosin / G04 - or Y16 - treated mammospheres ( Fig . 5 D ) . Al - though Rhosin / G04 or Y16 administration alone caused ∼ 50 % inhibition of RhoA activity at 10 μ M , combined Rhosin / G04 and Y16 reached ∼ 70 % inhibition of RhoA - GTP or thedownstream p - MLC when each was at 2 . 5 μ M ( Fig . 5 D ) . These results clearly indicate that Y16 and Rhosin / G04 , each capable of selectively inhibiting one target of the RhoGEF – RhoA enzyme – substrate pair , can act synergistically to inhibit RhoA activity and RhoA - regulated breast cancer cell behaviors . Discussion Rho family GTPases are critical intracellular signal transducers involved in diverse cell signal transduction processes from cell adhesion molecules , growth factor receptors , and G - protein – coupled receptors . The DBL family GEFs are the major class of activators for Rho GTPases including RhoA , Cdc42 , and Rac1 , and are known to possess transforming activity ( 6 – 10 ) . The three DBL family members , LARG , PDZRhoGEF , and p115 RhoGEF , represent a distinct RhoGEF subfamily characterized by the pres - ence of a RGS domain at their N termini that binds to the heter - otrimeric G α 12 / 13 proteins , and also the RhoGEF module , DH - PH domains , that directly signals to RhoA ( 11 – 15 ) . The G α 12 / 13 – RhoGEF – RhoA pathway has been implicated in cancer cell mi - gration , invasion , and proliferation , and is proposed to be useful anticancer drug target . Small - molecule chemicals are a class of attractive drug candi - dates and pharmacologic tools useful in targeting aberrant Rho GTPase signaling ( 27 ) . Extensive structural and biochemical studies of the RhoGEF – RhoA interaction and GEF reaction have presented detailed information valuable for the design of small molecules speci ﬁ cally targeting the GEF – Rho GTPase axis . Be - cause Rho GTPases , like Ras , are globular structures and lack useful grooves and pockets on their surface for high - af ﬁ nity chemical binding ( 21 ) , they are not considered as traditional “ druggable ” targets , which normally require deep hydrophobic pockets ( 17 – 20 ) . However , the DH - PH module of DBL family RhoGEFs appears suitable for targeting by small - molecule inhibitors judged by the relatively stable concavity formed at an interaction site between LARG residues N975 and R986 , which are required for Rho GTPase substrate recognition and ca - talysis ( 5 ) . Furthermore , as enzymes , RhoGEFs may serve as effective targets because a partial blockade of the GEF activity could result in an ampli ﬁ ed suppression of downstream Rho GTPase signal ﬂ ows . Thus , we have used the mechanistic in - formation of GEF – Rho interaction to pursue a rational design strategy by structure - based simulation and docking screen for chemicals targeting the site of a G - protein – coupled RhoGEF enzyme essential for Rho activation , i . e . , the DH - PH junction of LARG . Y16 , the lead compound , docks with a favorable energy into the C terminus of LARG DH domain junction site with PH domain , Fig . 5 .

Signi ﬁ cantly , Y16 displayed a speci ﬁ city against the heterotrimeric G - protein – regulated RhoGEFs , i . e . , LARG , p115RhoGEF , and PDZRho - GEF , with a measured binding constant of ∼ 76 nM K d , and did not interfere with the action of other RhoA - activating DBL family RhoGEFs such as DBL and LBC . Mutagenesis studies of LARG indicate that the Y16 binding site is located in the C terminus of the DH domain , a region essential for RhoA interaction . In cells , Y16 displays a selective inhibition of RhoA - GTP formation and RhoA - mediated F - actin stress ﬁ ber and focal adhesion formation . Importantly , the cellular inhibitory effects of Y16 can be rescued by the expression of a constitutively active RhoA or ROK mutant that is capable of bypassing endogenous RhoA - GTP to elicit downstream signaling . These biochemical and cell - biological properties indicate that Y16 is a G - protein – coupled RhoGEF - selective inhibitor . Although the molecular details of the speci - ﬁ city of Y16 toward LARG and related RhoGEFs remain unclear , it appears that the highly conserved structures of the LARG subfamily G - protein – coupled RhoGEFs contain unique residues corresponding to K979 and N983 of LARG to allow a distinction of Y16 and analogs from other DBL family DH - PH containing GEFs . To more clearly de ﬁ ne the mechanism of action , it will be a priority in future studies to obtain a structure of Y16 or its de - rivative in complex with LARG GEF domains . In vitro , Y16 binds to its target , LARG , with ∼ 80 nM af ﬁ nity but it takes higher than micromolar concentrations for it to be effective in cells . This is not unlike most kinase / enzyme inhibitors that are in use therapeuti - cally : in addition to target binding af ﬁ nity , additional factors such as transmembrane delivery / cell uptake ef ﬁ cacy , biostability , and nonspeci ﬁ c absorption / binding by serum or cellular proteins may contribute to its ef ﬁ cacy in cells . To directly target RhoA , we recently have identi ﬁ ed a lead chemical inhibitor , Rhosin / G04 , which contains two aromatic chemical fragments tethered by a ﬂ exible linker and may dock into two separate shallow grooves sandwiching the GEF recognition site of RhoA between the switch I and switch II regions ( 25 ) . Rhosin / G04 displays a micromolar binding af ﬁ nity to RhoA and can inhibit GEF binding to RhoA ( 25 ) . However , partly due to the relative low binding af ﬁ nity , over 30 μ M concentration of Rhosin / G04 is required to effectively inhibit RhoA activity in cells , leaving more to be desired for improvement . Given that Y16 and Rhosin are a pair of inhibitors designed to recognize the opposite in - teractive surfaces between LARG and RhoA , we reasoned that Y16 and Rhosin may work synergistically to inhibit LARG – RhoA signaling because the GEF and RhoA interact transiently and dynamically at de ﬁ ned intracellular locations . Indeed , we found that , when being applied together , Y16 and Rhosin yielded a syn - ergistic potency in suppressing LARG – RhoA interaction in vitro and RhoA activation in cells . This synergy is expected to further enhance speci ﬁ city , in addition to potency , for inhibiting the GEF – RhoA signaling pathway and shows an advantage in an approach of “ one interactive site , two drugs ” in rationally devising inhibitors interfering with an enzyme – substrate interface . Subsequently , we show in a breast cancer cell model that a combined application of Y16 and Rhosin is advantageous at more effectively inhibiting RhoA activity and tumor sphere growth . Overall , our work presents an attempt in translating the mech - anistic information of G - protein – mediated GEF – Rho GTPase signaling to rational design of chemical inhibitors useful for studying the physiological and pathologic roles of G - protein and Rho GTPase signaling . The studies also demonstrate a strategy of two inhibitors for one enzyme – substrate interaction is useful for selective targeting of signaling cascades deemed of “ low drugg - ability . ” This approach may have broad implications for drug discovery efforts targeting diverse signaling networks .
