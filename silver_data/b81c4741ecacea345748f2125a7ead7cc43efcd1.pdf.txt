Article Cell adhesion defines the topology of endocytosis and signaling Jean - Philippe Grossier 1 , Georgia Xouri 2 , Bruno Goud 1 , * & Kristine Schauer 1 , * * Abstract Preferred sites of endocytosis have been observed in various cell types , but whether they occur randomly or are linked to cellular cues is debated . Here , we quantified the sites of endocytosis of transferrin ( Tfn ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) in cells whose adhesion geometry was defined by micropatterns . 3 D probabilistic density maps revealed that Tfn was enriched in adhesive sites dur - ing uptake , whereas EGF endocytosis was restricted to the dorsal cellular surface . This spatial separation was not due to distribu - tions of corresponding receptors but was regulated by uptake mechanisms . Asymmetric uptake of Tfn resulted from the enrich - ment of clathrin and adaptor protein 2 at adhesive areas . Asymmetry in EGF uptake was strongly dependent on the actin cytoskeleton and led to asymmetry in EGF receptor activation . Mild alteration of actin dynamics abolished asymmetry in EGF uptake and decreased EGF - induced downstream signaling , suggesting that cellular adhesion cues influence signal propagation . We propose that restriction of endocytosis at distinct sites allows cells to sense their environment in an “ outside - in ” mechanism .

Many endocytic mechanisms exist , either through the well - characterized clathrin - dependent uptake or through alternative clathrin - independent path - ways that have been studied to a lesser extent ( Doherty & McMahon , 2009 ) . Despite a large body of publications , only a few studies have focused on the spatial organization of endocytosis . It has been shown in some specialized cells that endocytosis does not occur randomly along the entire cell surface but is restricted to discrete sites . For instance , hepatocytes internalize trophic receptors at endocytic ‘hot spots’ that are defined by large membrane invaginations at the ventral side of the cell ( Cao et al , 2011 ) . In neurons , ‘hot spots’ of endocytosis have been observed in close proximity to exocytic sites during high - frequency stimulation ( Gaffield et al , 2009 ) . Predefined sites at which clathrin - coated pits nucleate repeatedly have also been observed in various cell lines ( Gaidarov et al , 1999 ; Ehrlich et al , 2004 ; Kirchhau - sen , 2009 ; Saffarian et al , 2009 ; Batchelder & Yarar , 2010 ; Nunez et al , 2011 ; Taylor et al , 2011 ) . Some of these studies argue for the existence of defined endocytic platforms at the plasma membrane ( Gaidarov et al , 1999 ; Nunez et al , 2011 ) . The plasma membrane could compartmentalize endocytosis by differential sorting of cargo molecules through the action of adaptor proteins that are present at specific and limited loci ( Gaidarov et al , 1999 ; Lakadamyali et al , 2006 ; Leonard et al , 2008 ) . Against the existence of pre - existing sites , it has been suggested that clustered endocytic events occur by random initiation and stabilization of clathrin - coated pits ( Ehrlich et al , 2004 ) . Another hypothesis that has not been directly tested is that the presence of predefined sites of endocytosis is linked to cellular adhe - sion cues . To address this issue , we sought to exploit an approach developed in our laboratory that combines normalization of cellular adhesion geometry by micropatterning ( Thery et al , 2006b ) with quantification of spatial organization of trafficking molecules by density mapping ( Schauer et al , 2010 ) . Micropatterns of extracellu - lar matrix proteins that impose adhesive and non - adhesive areas to cultured cells , allow the control of internal cell organization , mim - icking the microenvironment found in tissues ( Gumbiner , 1996 ) . To measure spatial organization of labeled intracellular structures in micropatterned cells , the corresponding fluorescent signals are transformed into probabilistic , three - dimensional density maps ( supplementary Fig 1A ) . Here , we analyze the intracellular distribu - tion of endocytosed transferrin ( Tfn ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , two classical ligands of receptor - mediated endocytosis , in micropatterned cells in order to establish the role of cellular adhe - sion on uptake mechanisms and to address the potential function of predefined sites of endocytosis .

Thus , density maps provide information about the behavior of the majority of en - docytosed molecules but give less accurate knowledge of individual uptake events . We calculated the 50 % density contours that represent the smallest intracellular volume where 50 % of total Tfn or EGF signals are found . These maps showed that Tfn and EGF accumulated at the cell periphery at 5 min post - pulse and further concentrated in the cell center at 10 min post - pulse ( Fig 1B ) . Object - based colocaliza - tion analysis of endosomal marker proteins in micropatterned cells showed that both cargos were first shuttled to Rab5 - positive early endosomes before Tfn concentrated in the Rab11 - positive recycling compartment and EGF concentrated in the Rab7 - positive late endoso - mal compartment ( supplementary Fig 1B ) . Hence , trafficking dynam - ics of Tfn and EGF were in agreement with previous experiments performed in non - patterned cells ( Leonard et al , 2008 ) . Intriguingly , when density maps of Tfn and EGF were compared at 1 min post - pulse , a strong and unexpected difference in their dis - tributions was observed ( Fig 1C , D ) . The Z - projection of the fluores - cence images of single cells ( Fig 1C ) as well as quantitative density maps ( Fig 1D ) revealed that Tfn was densest at adhesive areas at the bottom of the cells matching the fibronectin micropattern geometry . A correlation between Tfn uptake topology and cell adhesion sites was further observed using different micropattern shapes such as a ring and a disc ( Fig 1C , D , middle and lower level ) . In contrast , EGF was concentrated on the upper , dorsal surface of the cell . To verify this observation , we additionally calculated the 75 and 90 % density maps . Although Tfn uptake was densest above the micropattern , Tfn uptake was also detected on the dorsal part of the cell as judged by the 90 % contour ( supplementary Fig 1C ) . In contrast , EGF uptake was restricted to the dorsal part even when taking into account the 90 % contour , with no EGF density at the ventral side . In non - pat - terned RPE - 1 cells ( either seeded on uncoated or fibronectin - coated coverslips ) , Tfn also concentrated at the cell bottom and EGF was densest at the upper side ( supplementary Fig 1D ) , although this was more difficult to monitor than in patterned cells . Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells and cells that form polarized epithelia , LLC - PK1 and Caco - 2 cells , although we noticed for these cell lines more cell - to - cell variation and less endocytosed structures per cell that gave rise to less defined density maps ( supplementary Fig 2A , B ) . The EGF - conjugate used in this study is about the same size ( MW = 68 kDa ) as the Tfn - conjugate ( MW = 80 kDa ) , suggesting that the difference between EGF and Tfn uptake topology cannot be explained by a lack of accessibility of EGF to the ventral part of the cell . In addition , rhodamine - labeled EGF ( MW = 6 . 5 kDa ) displayed the same behavior as the EGF - conjugate ( supplementary Fig 3A ) . Then , we investigated the cellular distribution of the corresponding receptors in non - permeabilized micropatterned cells ( Fig 2A , B ) . Tfn receptors ( TfnR ) were mainly localized at the bottom of the cell where they were distributed throughout the entire ventral side ( Fig 2A , green ) . Different from Tfn , TfnR distribution did not exactly match the pattern shape . More surprisingly , EGF receptors ( EGFR ) showed uniform distribution on the entire cell surface , including the bottom of the cell , where EGF was absent ( Fig 2B , green ) . The distri - butions of the TfnR and EGFR did not change in the presence and absence of their ligands . These results demonstrated that receptor distribution did not explain the topology of Tfn and EGF endocytosis . Tfn is exclusively taken up by clathrin - dependent endocytosis and requires the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 ( Smythe et al , 1992 ) . Thus , we investigated the localization of clathrin and AP2 in micro - patterned cells . The characteristic density maps of clathrin and AP2 showed a crossbow shape similar to the micropattern and the endo - cytozed Tfn density map after 1 min pulse ( Fig 2C ) . The distribution of clathrin was similar in the presence and absence of Tfn . As expected , gene silencing of clathrin heavy chain reduced the num - ber of Tfn structures by 90 % ( Fig 2D , E ) . These results suggest that concentration of Tfn uptake above the micropattern is due to the selective recruitment of AP2 and clathrin to adhesive areas . Epidermal growth factor uptake involves different mechanisms depending on EGF concentration and cell types ( Yamazaki et al , 2002 ; Orth et al , 2006 ; Sigismund et al , 2008 , 2012 ) . At high concen - trations ( > 100 ng / ml ) as used in this study for fluorescent visualiza - tion , it has been shown that a substantial proportion of EGF ( > 50 % ) is taken up by clathrin - independent mechanisms . In RPE - 1 cells , EGF uptake was not altered by clathrin knock down but was strongly inhibited by filipin treatment ( the number of EGF structures was reduced by 80 % , Fig 2D – F ) . Filipin binds specifically to cholesterol and has been shown to inhibit clathrin - independent endocytosis of EGF ( Sigismund et al , 2008 ) . Notably , the characteristic density map of endocytosed EGF did not correlate with those of clathrin and AP2 ( compare Fig 1D with Fig 2C ) . To better understand the mechanisms of EGF uptake in RPE - 1 cells , we varied the EGF concentration and performed co - localization analysis of EGF and clathrin . Decreasing the effective EGF concentration to 10 ng / ml , which should favor clathrin - dependent uptake , did not modify the density maps , indicat - ing that EGF uptake was still predominately restricted to the dorsal cell surface ( supplementary Fig 3B ) . Co - localization analysis of EGF and clathrin showed that at high concentration of EGF ( 100 ng / ml ) , a substantial portion of the EGF co - localized with clathrin ( 14 (cid:1) 3 % ) ( Fig 2G ) . Moreover , at low EGF concentration ( 10 ng / ml ) , the percent - age of co - localization increased to 20 (cid:1) 6 % . It is likely that in RPE - 1 cells EGF uptake is partly clathrin - dependent at the upper cell surface , but thatthis process can befullycompensated upon clathrin depletion . The cellular cytoskeleton organization intimately depends on the adhesion geometry of a cell ( Thery et al , 2006a ) . We therefore asked if cytoskeleton networks could define the topology of uptake . Actin fibers were disrupted with Cytochalasin D ( CD ) and microtubules were depolymerized with Nocodazole ( NZ ) . Remarkably , a mild treatment with CD redistributed Tfn as well as AP2 from a ventral localization matching the micropattern to the entire lower cell sur - face ( Fig 3A , B middle panels ) . Although this change in Tfn / AP2 topology was subtle , it demonstrated that concentration of Tfn uptake / AP2 at cell - matrix interaction sites is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton . However , Tfn uptake remained quantitatively the same as the number of Tfn structures ( Fig 3C ) and the colocaliza - tion with the early endosome marker Rab5 at 5 min post - pulse ( sup - plementary Fig 3C ) was comparable to that in control cells . This is in agreement with published data showing that disruption of the actin network does not significantly affect Tfn uptake ( Gaidarov et al , 1999 ) . In contrast , treatment with NZ did not change the topology of either Tfn or AP2 ( Fig 3A , B right panels ) . Epidermal growth factor uptake topology was also modified due to actin disruption but not upon microtubule depolymerization ( Fig 3E ) . Treatment with several drugs that either destabilized ( CD , Latrunculin A ) or stabilized ( Jasplakinolide ) actin fibers or inhibited acto - myosin contraction ( Blebbistatin ) , redistributed EGF uptake uniformly all around the cell ( Fig 3E and supplementary Fig 3D ) .

Depletion of the actin nucleation regulatory protein complex Arp2 / 3 ( Rottner et al , 2010 ) led to a similar effect ( supplementary Fig 3E ) . The number of EGF structures was compa - rable to that in control cells under all tested conditions ( Fig 3D and supplementary Fig 3F ) and the EGF uptake was not inhibited as revealed by colocalization analysis with the early endosome marker Rab5 ( supplementary Fig 3C ) . Tfn and EGF uptake assays are often performed by incubating the cells at 4 ° C with saturating amounts of ligands followed by washes and transfer to 37 ° C . Under these conditions , Tfn was inter - nalized from the entire lower surface and EGF internalization was observed all around the cell , similar to conditions in which actin was disrupted and similar to the corresponding receptor distribu - tions ( supplementary Fig 4 A , B ) . Interestingly , incubation of cells at 4 ° C altered the actin cytoskeleton , reinforcing the hypothesis that actin dynamics play an important role in the topology of endocytosis ( supplementary Fig 4C ) . We additionally monitored the dynamics of Tfn and EGF uptake at the adhesive plasma membrane by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) ( Fig 4 A and supplementary mov - Nocodazole Cytochalasin D A n = 100 n = 87 Cytochalasin D Nocodazole n = 38 AP2 AP2 Tfn Tfn no r m a li z ed T f n s t r u c t u r e c oun t pe r c e ll 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 2 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 1 . 2 D M S O cy t o c ha l a s i n D N o c oda z o l e 1 . 4 1 . 6 C B 001 = n 19 = n E DMSO Cytochalasin D Nocodazole EGF EGF EGF x y z n = 58 no r m a li z ed E G F s t r u c t u r e c oun t pe r c e ll 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 2 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 1 . 2 D M S O cy t o c ha l a s i n D N o c oda z o l e 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 D n = 91 n = 63 n = 31 Tfn DMSO AP2 DMSO x y z x y z Figure 3 .

Cells stably expressing EGFP - tagged clathrin heavy chain were imaged after 1 min of addition of Tfn or EGF . In agreement with results obtained in fixed cells , Tfn was present at the lower plasma membrane and showed colocalisation with EGFP - tagged clathrin heavy chain ( supplementary movie 1 ) , whereas EGF ( supplementary movie 2 ) was almost not detectable at the bottom of the cell by TIRFM ( Fig 4A , left panels ) . Similarly , mild disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with CD changed uptake topology , as Tfn ( supplementary movie 3 ) and EGF ( supplementary movie 4 ) were both detected at the lower plasma membrane ( Fig 4A , right panels ) . This demonstrates that spatial separation of Tfn and EGF uptake on micropatterned cells is consistent under different experimental conditions . We noticed in TIRFM that mild disruption of the actin cyto - skeleton led to higher co - localization between EGF and clathrin ( Fig 4A , lower panels , Fig 4B ) . To further investigate this obser - vation we analyzed the co - localization between Tfn or EGF and endogenous clathrin ( Fig 4C ) . In the presence of CD , EGF co - localized more with endogenous clathrin ( 21 (cid:1) 8 % ) than in control conditions . On the other hand , the extent of co - localiza - tion was not changed between Tfn and clathrin under the same conditions . Concomitantly , co - localization between EGF and Tfn increased substantially upon actin disruption ( using different drugs , supplementary Fig 3G ) . These results question whether depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton led to a switch in the uptake mechanism of EGF requiring careful analysis in future studies .

The EMBO Journal Adhesion cues place signaling into the cellular space Jean - Philippe Grossier et al 40 The EMBO Journal Vol 33 | No 1 | 2014 ª 2014 The Authors Published online : December 23 , 2013 tributed EGF uptake all around the cells and changed the topology of Tfn uptake from the adhesive surface to a more homogenous dis - tribution ( supplementary Fig 2C , D ) . However , CD did not impact Tfn and EGF uptake topology in Caco - 2 cells . To understand the potential reason for this different behavior , we compared the actin cytoskeleton of the four cell lines analyzed . As shown in supplemen - tary Fig 2E , actin cytoskeleton was comparable in RPE - 1 , HeLa and LLC - PK1 cells . In particular , these cell lines displayed two thick stress fibers along the non - adhesive edges and many thinner ones that were distributed all along the lower surface of the cell . In con - trast , the Caco - 2 cell line showed a strong morphological heteroge - neity in its actin cytoskeleton . Some cells formed stress fibers at the surface of the micropattern but others did not , and bundles of stress fibers were often observed along the edges of the micropattern , reflecting the round cellular form . This heterogeneity in the actin cytoskeleton may explain the lack of effect of CD on EGF uptake in Caco - 2 cells . Epidermal growth factor endocytosis has been shown to trigger signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation , differentiation , motility and cell death ( Roberts & Der , 2007 ; Sigismund et al , 2012 ) . Therefore , we investigated whether EGF - induced signal transduction through the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways ( Seger & Krebs , 1995 ) was altered upon changes in EGF uptake topology . To redistribute EGF uptake throughout the entire cell , the actin cytoskeleton was disrupted with CD and immuno - blot analysis was performed against phos - phorylated EGFR ( p - EGFR ) and downstream signaling molecules , p - Akt and p - ERK1 / 2 , at different time points after EGF stimula - tion . Whereas phoshorylation of EGFR was not significantly chan - ged after EGF addition , the amount of p - Akt and p - ERK1 / 2 was significantly decreased in cells treated with CD ( Fig 5A , B ) , indi - cating that downstream EGF - mediated signaling has been altered . Similar results were obtained after inhibition of the actomyosin network with Blebbistatin ( supplementary Fig 5A ) . Finally , we asked whether asymmetry in EGF uptake is trans - lated into asymmetry in signal transduction . For this , EGF - induced signal initiation was directly monitored in living cells using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based probe . Micropatterned cells stably expressing a modified FLAME probe ( Offterdinger et al , 2004 ) that monitors phosphorylation of the EGFR due to changes in FRET ratio ( Fig 5C , D and supplemen - tary Fig 5B ) were analyzed . Ratiometric image analysis was per - formed at several z - planes for each cell studied and at different areas ( central versus peripheral areas ) for each z - plane ( Fig 5C and supplementary Fig 5C ) . We found that addition of EGF decreased FRET ratio at the cell periphery at the upper and mid - dle part of the cells but did not change FRET ratio at the central region at the bottom of the cells ( Fig 5D , left panel ) . Addition of the drug AG1478 that inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and thus leads to the dephosphorylation of EGFR increased FRET ratio in all parts of the cell . This demonstrates that asymmetry in EGF endocytosis leads to asymmetric EGFR phoshorylation in micro - patterned cells . Similar analyses were performed in cells whose actin cytoskeleton was disrupted by a mild treatment with CD ( Fig 5D , right panel ) . Under this condition , EGFR stimulation was detected in all parts of the cell . These results directly demonstrate that actin dependent asymmetry in EGF uptake leads to asymme - try in EGFR activation . Discussion Eukaryotic cells display an intrinsic internal polarity relying on the anisotropy of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton that is most obvious when cells migrate or form epithelia . Studies using fibro - nectin micropatterns have illustrated that cell internal polarity responds to the geometry of cellular adhesion cues ( Thery et al , 2006b ) . We have previously found that trafficking compartments such as multivesicular bodies / lysosomes show an anisotropic distri - bution in cells grown on polarizing micropatterns ( Schauer et al , 2010 ) . The present study reveals an unexpected dorsal / ventral asymmetry in both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis that predefines uptake of Tfn and EGF at distinct cellu - lar sites . We found that the distribution of both TfnR and EGFR does not define the sites of endocytosis , indicating that the presence of recep - tors at the plasma membrane is not sufficient to initiate endocytosis after cargo binding . This suggests that additional mechanisms such as receptor activation and / or the types of endocytosis need to be considered . In the case of TfnR , endocytosis is likely initiated by a specific recruitment of AP2 and clathrin to adhesive sites , possibly by SNX9 that was found to organize nucleation of clathrin coated pits ( Nunez et al , 2011 ) . Our results show that Tfn , and by exten - sion , clathrin - dependent endocytosis is enriched at cell - ECM adhe - sions . In migrating cells , a significant accumulation of clathrin was found at the leading edge ( Rappoport & Simon , 2003 ) , which corre - sponds to the bow front of the micropattern . In addition , clathrin - dependent endocytosis plays a major role in the maturation , the dynamics and disassembly of focal adhesions that accumulate on the edges of the micropattern ( Thery et al , 2006b ; Ezratty et al , 2009 ; Stehbens & Wittmann , 2013 ) . Note that although clathrin - dependent endocytosis was enriched above the micropattern , it is not restricted to these sites ( supplementary Fig 1C ) . Indeed , clathrin is an abundant protein that is detected on the entire plasma mem - brane . For EGFR , mechanisms of receptor activation and the type of endocytosis seem to be important . It was initially proposed that binding of EGF to EGFR results in the dimerization of the receptor , its activation by trans - phosphorylation and its subsequent internali - zation . However , the picture became far more complex through high - resolution studies visualizing receptor dimerization occurring continuously and reversibly even in the absence of ligand ( Chung et al , 2010 ) . Interestingly , Chung et al have shown that dimer for - mation of EGFR is not homogenous at the ( ventral ) plasma mem - brane but occurs more prevalent at the cell periphery in agreement with our results that EGF uptake from the ventral plasma membrane is limited . The internalization mechanism of EGF has long been a subject of debate . Although EGFR has an YXXX / motif that binds AP - 2 , it has been shown that the depletion thereof does not affect the internalization of EGF ( Motley et al , 2003 ) . We found that in patterned RPE - 1 cells , EGF internalization was mostly clathrin - inde - pendent at the dorsal plasma membrane . This internalization was filipin sensitive as previously reported ( Sigismund et al , 2008 ) . However , it is likely that a small portion of EGF is internalized by a clathrin - dependent mechanism , because decreasing the EGF concen - tration increased co - localization with clathrin . RPE - 1 cells seem to fully compensate this pathway with clathrin - independent ones after Jean - Philippe Grossier et al Adhesion cues place signaling into the cellular space The EMBO Journal 41 ª 2014 The Authors The EMBO Journal Vol 33 | No 1 | 2014 Published online : December 23 , 2013 depletion of clathrin . Moreover , we found that depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton increased co - localization between EGF and clathrin , especially at the lower plasma membrane . The actin network is critical to define and maintain asymmetry in EGF and Tfn uptake . In accordance to the ‘fence and picket’ model , the actin cortex partitions the plasmalemma into membrane domains with potentially variable molecular properties ( Kusumi & Sako , 1996 ) . Our results show that the actin cytoskeleton integrates the cell with its extracellular environment using a delicate balance between restriction and propagation of endocytosis . As a consequence , differences in the actin cytoskeleton observed in distinct cell lines may led to subtle differences in ligand internalization . This seems to be particularly important for ligands that can enter the cell by different uptake mechanisms , like EGF . Tfn endocytosis is less restricted to adhesive sites when the actin cytoskeleton is disturbed , in agreement with previous studies showing that preformed sites of internalization are defined by the presence of cortical actin ( Gaida - rov et al , 1999 ; Nunez et al , 2011 ) . The role of actin in the distribu - tion of clathrin may be more indirect , for instance destabilizing adhesion complexes , which would be no longer able to recruit AP2 A B p - EGFR tubulin p - ERK1 / 2 p - Akt time ( min ) Cytochalasin D + + – – + – – + + + – – 0 2 5 15 60 180 p - E G F R ( a . u . ) 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 180 60 15 5 time ( min ) DMSO Cytochalasin D p - E R K 1 / 2 ( a . u . ) 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 180 60 15 5 time ( min ) 0s 60s EGF 60s AG1478 m i dd l e 0 . 74 1 . 37 0 . 75 1 . 33 p - A k t ( a . u . ) 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 180 60 15 5 time ( min ) C 0s 60s EGF 60s AG1478 m o tt ob po t 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 . 96 0 . 98 0 . 99 0 . 97 1 . 00 1 . 01 1 . 02 1 . 04 1 . 03 0 . 96 0 . 98 0 . 99 0 . 97 1 . 00 1 . 01 1 . 02 1 . 04 1 . 03 ) nim ( emit ) nim ( emit bottom top / middle bottom top / middle D EGF AG1478 EGF AG1478 D nisalahcotyC OSMD r a t i o / R 0 r a t i o / R 0 DMSO Cytochalasin D DMSO Cytochalasin D DMSO Cytochalasin D E signal A signal B actin filament intact cell top bottom cell upon mild actin disruption * * * * * * * Figure 5 .

As the actin cytoskeleton shows strong variations between different cell lines , uptake topology of ligands may vary substantially between different cell lines . Together our results suggest that preformed sites of internalization are spatially organized by cell adhesion and are specific for ligands . We demonstrate that the cell surface is functionally organized and that this organization is defined by an ‘outside - in’ mechanism where cellular adhesion cues permit endocytosis at distinct sites . A tight coupling between the endocytic and signaling systems has been recognized during recent years ( Scita & Di Fiore , 2010 ; Sigismund et al , 2012 ) . It has been proposed that triggering internal - ization of EGF by clathrin - independent pathways ( at 100 ng / ml ) leads to the quick degradation of the EGFR , therefore attenuating signaling ( Sigismund et al , 2008 ) . Contrary , during clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis ( at < 20 ng / ml ) , the EGFR is recycled , which sustains signaling . We found that mild disruption of the actin cyto - skeleton increased co - localization between EGF and clathrin , but reduced Akt and ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation indicating that additional mechanisms of regulation might exist . We found that actin - dependent restriction of EGF endocytosis to the dorsal site was accompanied by spatial restriction of EGFR acti - vation . It is interesting to note that a recent study described a dorsal activation of EGFR ( Endres et al , 2013 ) . Treatment with CD led to a homogenous EGFR activation without decreasing total p - EGFR lev - els . One possible interpretation is that , upon actin depolymerization , effectors downstream of p - EGFR are recruited to a larger surface on the plasma membrane , thus decreasing their local concentration . We propose that polarized endocytosis of ligands determines the spatial distribution of downstream signaling gradients , thus propa - gating signals from the extracellular into the intracellular space and allowing cells to sense their environment ( Fig 5E ) . It has been sug - gested that partitioning the plasma membrane into domains , will allow cells to keep the balance between responding to an actual sig - nal and restrict spurious events induced by noise ( Grecco et al , 2011 ) . Our observation that the cell surface is functionally organized could provide a cellular mechanism for the maintenance of spatial memory : allowing cells to sense their environment and to dynami - cally respond to growth factor stimulation in a polarized fashion . However , we cannot exclude that actin has a more indirect effect on downstream effectors by inhibiting their proper recruitment . Future studies will aim at addressing this issue . In conclusion , our results highlight that endocytosis from the cell surface is asymmetric and that spatial restriction of endocytic sites plays a crucial role in signal transduction . They point out for a cellular mechanism responsible for context - dependent signaling responses . Materials and Methods Cells and reagents Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial ( RPE - 1 ) cells ( Invitrogen , Eugene , OR , USA ) were grown in DMEM / F12 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % ampicillin - streptomycin . EGFP - Rab7A , EGFP - Rab11A , EGFP - clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) and FLAME – expressing stable cell lines were generated by transfection of the plasmids pEG - FP - Rab7Awt , pEGFP - Rab11Awt , pEGFP - clathrin heavy chain and pFLAME into RPE - 1 cells and selection with 500 l g / ml geneticin . The pFLAME construct was a modified FLAME probe that contains mCitrine and mCherry as FRET donor and acceptor ( Offterdinger et al , 2004 ) . Pattern production and cell plating conditions were as previously described ( Azioune et al , 2009 ) . EGF ( biotinylated and complexed to Alexa Fluor (cid:2) 555 streptavidin or a tetramethylrhod - amine conjugate ) , Tfn ( from human serum , Alexa fluor 488 conju - gate , Invitrogen , Eugene , OR , USA ) and phalloidin ( Alexa Fluor (cid:2) 350 Phalloidin ) were from Invitrogen . To depolymerize microtubules , Nocodazole ( NZ ) was added to a final concentration of 20 l M and cells were left at 4 ° C for 60 min . Cells were then transferred to 37 ° C and incubated for 1 h . To disrupt the actin cytoskeleton , Cytochalasin D ( CD ) was added to a final concentration of 0 . 5 l M and cells were incubated at 37 ° C for 1 h . Latrunculin A ( 0 . 5 l M ) , Blebbistatin ( 50 l M ) , Jasplakinolide ( 1 l M ) and Filipin ( 1 l M ) were used follow - ing the same procedure . To dephosphorylate EGFR , AG1478 was added to cells at a final concentration of 100 ng / ml ( Calbiochem , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Antibodies : anti - Rab5 ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) , anti - Clathrin Heavy Chain ( sc6579 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Dallas , TX , USA ) , anti - EGFR ( # GR15 , Calbiochem , Darmstadt , Germany ) , anti - TfnR ( C2063 , Sigma - Aldrich Co . , St . Louis , MO , USA ) , anti - AP2 ( ab11907 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , anti - p - EGFR ( # 3777 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , anti - p - Akt ( # 4060 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , anti - p - ERK1 / 2 ( # 4370 , Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) . Pulse - chase experiments Cells were seeded on micropatterned coverslips and serum starved for 2 h at 37 ° C in DMEM / F12 medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 0 . 1 % BSA . Cells were pulsed with fluorescently marked EGF ( 1 l g / ml ) and Tfn ( 20 l g / ml ) for 1 min at 37 ° C , then quickly washed and fixed directly in 4 % PFA or chased at 37 ° C in DMEM / F12 medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES for various time points and fixed . A mild acidic wash with acidic salt buffer ( 0 . 2 M sodium acetate , 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH 4 . 5 ) was performed to discriminate between endocytosed EGF and EGF bound to the cell surface . For experiments with pre - incubation at 4 ° C , micropatterned cells were first cooled down at 4 ° C for 15 min in DMEM / F12 medium supple - mented with 20 mM HEPES . Then , EGF and Tfn were added on ice and cells were incubated at 4 ° C for an additional 45 min . Cells were then washed in PBS and chased in warm DMEM / F12 medium sup - plemented with 20 mM HEPES for 2 min at 37 ° C before fixation in 4 % PFA . Immunofluorescence PFA - fixed cells were quenched with 0 . 05 M NH 4 Cl , washed three times with PBS and either permeabilized in PBS with 2 % BSA and 0 . 05 % saponine or only incubated in PBS with 2 % BSA . Cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h , washed in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 - or Cy3 coupled secondary antibod - ies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , Newmarket , UK ) . After three washes in PBS , coverslips were mounted on glass slide with Moviol . Image acquisition and processing Images were acquired with either an upright widefield microscope from Leica equipped with 100 9 UPlanSApo VC oil objective , a piezoelectric motor and highly sensitive cooled interlined charge - coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( CoolSnap Hq2 , Photometrics , Tucson , AZ , USA ) or an inverted widefield Deltavision Core Microscope Jean - Philippe Grossier et al Adhesion cues place signaling into the cellular space The EMBO Journal 43 ª 2014 The Authors The EMBO Journal Vol 33 | No 1 | 2014 Published online : December 23 , 2013 ( Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA , USA ) . For each experiment , sev - eral tens of cells ( > 20 ) were imaged . For each cell , images were acquired for up to four fluorescence channels , including fluores - cence staining of the micropattern ( e . g . Cy5 ) , the nucleus ( e . g . Dapi ) and the intracellular structures of interest ( e . g . GFP , Cy3 ) . The nucleus staining was observed to verify that a single cell was ana - lyzed , as several cells can be attached onto a single micropattern . To obtain 3D density maps , z - dimension series were acquired every 0 . 2 l m and out of focus signals were reduced using deconvolution . To extract the 3D spatial coordinates of intracellular structures images were segmented with the multidimensional image analysis ( MIA ) interface running on MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices , Sunny - vale , CA , USA ) based on wavelet decomposition . After segmenta - tion , the coordinates ( centroids ) of all structures of interest from all cells were aligned using the micropattern . For this , coordinates of the center and the angle of rotation of the micropattern were mea - sured . We established a macro in ImageJ ( Bethesda , MD , USA ) that chooses the most in - focus image of the 3D stack of fluorescently labeled patterns and applies the ImageJ plugin ‘Hough - Circles’ to detect the center of a circle around the micropattern . To orient cells in one direction a micropattern - shaped mask was rotated to find the angle for alignment . This image processing provided aligned coordi - nates for each detected structure from several tens of cells from independent experiments that were used to calculate corresponding density maps for each condition . Density map estimation The density estimation was performed using the ks library in R ( R Development Core Team , 2013 ) as previously described ( Schauer et al , 2010 ) . To visualize density maps , the extension libraries mvt - norm , rgl , miscd , ks were used . Image analysis For the counting of fluorescent Tfn / EGF structures under different conditions , the mean number of fluorescent objects per cell detected by MIA was calculated for each condition ( > 20 cells per condition ) and normalized to control . Co - localization analysis was performed with an in house object - based macro in ImageJ as in ( Bolte & Cordel - ieres , 2006 ) . Briefly , two structures were considered co - localized if the distance between their centroids ( MIA segmentation output ) were found inferior to the optical resolution limit . Co - localization results are given as the percentage of co - localized structures over the total number of structures . At least 20 cells per condition were ana - lyzed . Average intensity maps of the actin distribution were obtained by applying an average intensity projection of the most in focus plane of the phalloidin staining for > 20 aligned micropatterned cells . siRNA gene silencing Cells ( 10 000 ) were transfected with 20 pmol siRNA using standard protocols and incubated for 72 h prior further manipulations . The target sequence for clathrin heavy chain was 5 ′ - UAAU CCAAUUCGAAGACCAAU - 3 ′ and those for luciferase was 5 ′ - CGUA CGCGGAAUACUUCGA - 3 ′ . Arp2 / 3 was silenced using siRNA as in ( Misselwitz et al , 2011 ) . Immunoblotting RPE - 1 cells were seeded ( 300 000 cells / well ) into fibronectin - coated 6 - well plates ( Millipore ) and starved overnight in DMEM / F12 med - ium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES . Cells were treated with DMSO or Cytochalasin D for 1 h and pulsed with EGF ( 1 l g / ml ) at 37 ° C for different time points . After one wash in ice - cold PBS , cells were harvested in Laemmli buffer and subjected to immuno - blotting using standard protocols . Quantification of the ECL signals from three independent experiments was performed with ImageJ . Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy ( TIRFM ) Micropatterned EGFP - clathrin heavy chain RPE - 1 cells were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti Inverted Microscope ( Nikon Instruments Europe BV , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) equipped with a 100X / NA1 . 49 TIRF objective , a TIRF arm and a QuantEM EMCCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Evry , France ) . GFP and Cy3 were excited with a 491 and 560 nm laser , respectively ( 100 mW , Roper Scientific , Evry , France ) . The system was driven by MetaMorph ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . Image sequences were recorded for 5 min at a 1 s frame rate 1 min after ligand addition . FRET analysis of the FLAME probe Ratiometric imaging was performed using an inverted widefield Del - tavision Core Microscope ( Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA , USA ) equipped with a 60X / 1 . 4NA oil immersion objective . Z - dimension series of images were taken every 2 l m . Micropatterned FLAME RPE - 1 cells were illuminated by a xenon arc lamp through a 490 / 20 excitation filter and imaged sequentially through 525 / 36 ( GFP ) and 605 / 52 ( cherry ) emission filters with a coolSnap Hq2 camera set to 2 9 2 binning . After background subtraction , images were corrected for photobleaching using a mono - exponential curve fitting . Ratios were calculated by pixel - wise divisions of the images in the cherry and GFP channels . Quantification was per - formed on every z section in two regions of interest ( ROI ) defined at the center and the periphery of the cell . At least three cells per condition were analyzed .
