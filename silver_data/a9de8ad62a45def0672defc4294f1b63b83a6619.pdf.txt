V . 2020 Abstract This paper presents the results of a 2 - year longitudinal study aimed at characterizing and comparing the design cognition of high school students with and without formal engineer - ing design experiences . The students—working as dyads—engaged in design - only sessions generating solutions in response to the same engineering design challenges . The design sessions were video and audio recorded , transcribed , then segmented and coded using the Function – Behavior – Structure ontologically - based design issues and design processes cod - ing scheme . Both the design issues and design processes were described and compared between the two high school student groups . The results of this study revealed significant differences in design issues , processes , and the cognitive effort in their problem / solution spaces between the two high school student groups when the design sessions were par - titioned in two and three equal contiguous fractions . The paper concludes with a discus - sion regarding the significance of the differences found in this study and their pedagogical implications .

Lammi et al . 1 3 they already possess and their preconceptions or pre - existing language ( Bransford et al . 2000 ) . If the new content has few connections to what students already know , students’ motivation and effective learning is less likely to occur ( Albanese and Mitchell 1993 ; Eisenkraft 2010 ) . Thus , effective instruction should provide opportunities for students to actively construct knowledge by adjusting , rejecting , or modifying their prior understand - ing based on their experiences ( Prince and Felder 2006 ) . Education research demonstrates that educators create more effective learning environments when they take students’ pre - conceptions into account in designing and monitoring lessons ( Bransford et al . 2000 ) . Within post - secondary engineering programs , tools such as locally developed diag - nostic tests , concept maps , and concept inventories have been used to identify students’ prior knowledge , both as a pedagogical strategy to help faculty target instruction and as an assessment measure to monitor the development of learning ( Dixon and Lammi 2014 ; Krause et al . 2003 ; Lee et al . 2006 ; Turns et al . 2000 ) . In most instances , however , engi - neering educators have focused on identifying prior knowledge and misconceptions asso - ciated with technical content , e . g . , statics , thermodynamics , and materials science . Little work has been done to date in understanding students’ prior knowledge with respect to engineering design—or what can be termed their “prior practices” and , even more impor - tantly , their “mispractices” ( akin to misconceptions ) that influence subsequent learning experiences . Recognizing these prior engineering design practices and correcting for any misprac - tices is beneficial in planning post - secondary engineering programs that are pedagogically effective in promoting the desired engineering practices . To this end , cornerstone design experiences have increasingly pervaded first year programs following calls from a number of academic and industry leaders ( Dym 2008 ; Dym et al . 2005 ; Hyman 2001 ; Sheppard and Jenison 1997 ; Sheppard et al . 2009 ) . However , little is known or understood about the alignment between pre - engineering design experiences and the expectations of first year engineering students . This gap in understanding is of growing concern given pre - college education is increasingly embracing engineering practices , specifically those of engineer - ing design , as a tool for integrative STEM education learning ( Asunda 2012 ; Kolodner 2002 ; National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council 2014 ; Wells 2016 , 2017 ) . In light of this , as more students enter their first year of engineering at the college level with middle - and high - school pre - engineering design experiences , higher education faculty responsible for delivering first year programs would benefit from a deeper under - standing of how those prior experiences shape students’ designerly thinking so as to better inform their own pedagogies . Furthermore , as more pre - college educators integrate pre - engineering design experiences into their classes , whether through national programs such as Engineering By Design ( http : / / www . iteac onnec t . org / EbD / ebd . htm ) , Project Lead the Way ( http : / / www . pltw . org / ) , or locally developed programs , they also need to understand how the pre - engineering design experiences affect students design practices and to address any mispractices in order to insure that these practices will align with requisite experiential expectations of higher education . As an initial step in better understanding the designerly thinking of pre - engineering stu - dents , the research reported in this paper was led by the following fundamental research question : What are the measurable cognitive differences in designing between high school students with and without formal engineering design experiences ? This research sought to complement the standard behavior - based analysis of many studies by applying devel - opments in cognitive science utilizing a task - independent approach to protocol analysis . Such an analysis can be used to evaluate the effects of education on design cognition across a wide range of contexts . In doing so , it seeks to move from a behavior - based analysis 313 High school pre‑engineering students’ engineering design… 1 3 to one that addresses underlying cognitive processes and provides a common basis from which engineering education researchers are able to compare learning across contexts— including non - engineering contexts—and ultimately test the effects of specific educational interventions . Aims and significance A primary aim of this 2 - year longitudinal study was to characterize and compare the design cognition of high school students with and without formal engineering design experiences . The premise behind making such comparisons is supported by research indicating the cur - ricular and instructional association with the development of student cognitive abilities ( Davis et al . 2002 ; Schunn 2009 ; Silk et al . 2009 ) . Results from the current study build on previous studies on the development of design cognition ( C . Atman et al . 2007 ; Becker and Mentzer 2015 ; Gero et al . 2013 ; Lee et al . 2012 ) . The following hypotheses guided this research : 1 . High school pre - engineering students have a stronger focus than high school students without formal design experiences on the design process of synthesis , i . e . , the process of producing solutions . 2 . High school pre - engineering students have a stronger focus than high school students without formal design experiences on the design process of analysis . 3 . High school students without formal design experiences have a stronger focus than high school pre - engineering students on the design issue of structure . 4 . High school students without formal design experiences have a stronger focus than high school pre - engineering students on the design issue of expected behavior , i . e . , on how the design is meant to perform , rather than on how the design does perform . 5 . High school students without formal design experiences have a stronger focus than high school pre - engineering students on the design process of evaluation . 6 . High school pre - engineering students have a stronger focus on the problem space than high school students without formal design experiences as measured by the P – S Issues and Process Index . The results of this study form an evidence - based foundation for improving the under - standing of pre - college design experiences on students’ design practices and can be used to assist those in higher education develop first year programs that more effectively take students’ prior practices into account . At the pre - college level , an analysis of the impact of engineering experiences on design cognition may provide additional understanding on designerly thinking and help monitor the alignment of engineering design at pre - college and university levels . Background Engineering design education Design enjoys an increasing presence in postsecondary engineering programs ( Adams et al . 2003 ; Dym et al . 2005 ; Sheppard et al . 2004 ; Silva et al . 2015 ) . The literature on 314 M . D . Lammi et al . 1 3 engineering research and practice has primarily focused on design outcomes and finished products . As design is a process , there should be a focus on the development of the solution and the methods used to arrive at a demonstrable end ( ABET 2019 ) . Many have attempted to define engineering design . Engineering design has multiple definitions . Engineering design is : the process of devising a system , component , or process to meet desired needs ( ABET 2019 ) ; systematic ( Dym et al . 2005 ) ; a social process . ( Buc - ciarelli 1994 ) ; not linear ( Sheppard et al . 2009 ) ; a decision - making process . ( Hazelrigg 1998 ) ; creative , iterative , and often open - ended process ( Asunda and Hill 2007 ) . Common among the definitions above is the term “process . ” A process is a deliberate activity with a purpose rather than a haphazard or unintentional approach . Unlike a prescribed proce - dure , a process tends to be more open and fluid . The definitions also suggest that a solution comes from a response to a need or problem . Although constructing a concise definition may seem untenable , engineering design can be learned ( Dym and Little 2004 ) . Engineering design has been advocated as a curricular focus in the science , technology , engineering , and math ( STEM ) subject areas in pre - college settings ( Denson and Lammi 2014 ; International Technology and Engineering Education Association 2000 ; Lewis 2007 ; NGSS Lead States 2013 ; Schunn 2008 ; Wicklein 2006 ) and has the potential of integrating STEM subjects , higher order thinking skills , academic rigor , experiential learning , and sys - tems thinking ( Hmelo - Silver et al . 2000 ; Jonassen 2011 ; Katehi et al . 2009 ; Lammi 2011 ; Mehalik et al . 2008 ; National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council , 2014 ; Silk et al . 2009 ; Wells 2016 , 2017 ; Wicklein 2006 ) . Although there is a lot to be learned from further research into the effects of introducing engineering at the pre - college level , research suggests teaching engineering to children is appropriate if done with the proper support ( Schunn 2009 ; Silk et al . 2009 ) . Hmelo - Silver , Holton , and Kolodner ( 2000 , p . 288 ) also suggest that students may begin the design pro - cess without thorough background knowledge as “there is always something they can get started with based on what they already know . ” Students are able to learn science and math principles ( Eisenkraft 2011 ; Lehrer and Schauble 2000 ) . Among these principles are elec - tromagnetics ( Sadler et al . 2000 ) , force diagrams , data tables , and mathematical equations ( Schunn 2009 ) . Not only are students learning science content , but also design habits of mind . Models and visualizations help to offload the students’ cognition and improve conceptual under - standing ( Moore et al . 2013 ; Sweller and Chandler 1994 ) . Mathematical models , albeit simple , can be employed by 3rd graders ( Lehrer and Schauble 2000 ) . Students can also learn complex problem solving ( Resnick and Wilensky 1998 ) . The initial body of literature on engineering design suggests that teaching and learning such practices in engineering is feasible in pre - college education , but it does not provide much insight into students’ design cognition , which is necessary to inform curricular and pedagogical reform efforts . Design cognition While engineering education research in design has been dominated by explorations of design teaching , there have been numerous cognitive studies of designers that have been aimed at elucidating design thinking behavior ( C . J . Atman and Bursic 1998 ; Christensen and Schunn 2007 ; Cross 2002 ; Ennis and Gyeszly 1991 ; Gero and Mc Neill 1998 ; Huffman et al . 2013 ; Purzer et al . 2008 ) . The model of design analysis for this study is based on a general design ontology , namely , the Function – Behavior – Structure ( FBS ) ontology ( Gero 1990 ) that provides a design - based coding scheme applicable in studying design cognition . 315 High school pre‑engineering students’ engineering design… 1 3 The FBS ontology models designing in terms of three classes of ontological variables or design issues : function , behavior , and structure plus requirements ( which are expressible in terms of function , behavior or structure ) and design description ( which expresses func - tion , behavior or structure ) , Fig . 1 . In this view the goal of designing is to transform a set of requirements and functions into a set of design descriptions ( D ) . The requirements ( R ) on a designed object come from outside the designer . The function ( F ) of a designed object is defined as its teleology ; the behavior ( B ) of that object is either derived ( Bs ) or expected ( Be ) from the structure , where structure ( S ) represents the components of an object and their relationships . A design description is never transformed directly from the function but is a consequence of a series of processes among the FBS variables . These processes include : formulation which transform requirements into functions and functions into a set of expected behaviors ( process 1 in Fig . 1 ) ; synthesis , where a structure is proposed to ful - fill the expected behaviors ( process 2 ) ; an analysis of the structure produces derived behav - ior ( process 3 ) ; an evaluation process acts between the expected behavior and the behavior derived from structure ( process 4 ) ; documentation , which produces the design description ( process 5 ) . Reformulation is an ongoing , recurrent process of three distinct types : refor - mulation I—reformulation of structure ( process 6 ) , reformulation II—reformulation of expected behavior ( process 7 ) , and reformulation III—reformulation of function ( process 8 ) . Figure 1 shows the relationships among the eight transformation processes and the three basic classes of design issues , which claim to be the fundamental processes for designing . Another method to measure design behavior at a meta level is to divide the cognitive effort focused on the problem by the cognitive effort focused on the solution . This yields a ratio of cognitive effort called the problem solution ( P – S ) index , and can be calculated for both the design issues and processes . The P – S Index for design issues is calculated by dividing the summed frequency of requirement ( R ) , function ( F ) , and expected behavior Fig . 1 FBS Ontology Design Issues and Processes 316 M . D . Lammi et al . 1 3 ( Be ) by those of behavior from structure ( Bs ) and structure ( S ) . The P – S Index for design processes is calculated by dividing the summed frequency of formulation , reformulation II , and reformulation III by those of synthesis , analysis , evaluation , and reformulation I . Detailed analysis of protocols has become easier and more efficient with the open avail - ability of software targeted specifically at this task ( Pourmohamadi and Gero 2011 ) . The broad applicability of a coding scheme based on the FBS ontology is key in its value as a tool to analyze design cognition across tasks and environments . Such cross - environment analyses , included not only within engineering but between engineering and other fields as well , is important as engineering education researchers hope to develop approaches to design pedagogy and curriculum that are grounded in a deep understanding of how stu - dents learn . A coding scheme based on the FBS ontology results in the cognition of design - ing being initially described by the design issues and their distributions that a designer focuses on while designing . The design processes are derived from the sequence of design issues and their distributions can be determined . Focusing on the measures and distributions of the design issues together with the meas - ures and distributions of the cognitive design processes provides a foundation for compari - sons of designing between the high school students with and without design experience . Method Research design This longitudinal study used a two - by - two factorial research design across two exogenous variables ( design experience and maturity ) to investigate high school student design prac - tices over 2 years using protocol analysis ( Becker and Mentzer 2015 ; Cross et al . 1994 ; Kan and Gero 2005 ) . Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval from the Board of Human Subjects at Virginia Tech for conducting research with high school students was awarded prior to data collection . All high school students enrolled at participating high schools were invited to participate in the study , and students and parents were provided an IRB approved research recruitment document . Parent permission and student assent forms were returned , appropriately signed , for all participants . This paper reports the results on 2 years of data collected from participating high school juniors and seniors with and without formal engi - neering design experiences . These data were then compared within and between groups for students’ design cognition . Pairs of students ( dyads ) collaborated to arrive at a solution ( description only ) to an engineering design challenge . In this study , a pre - college engineering design challenge is an educational activity that engages students in formulating and satisfying an authen - tic engineering problem ( Mentzer and Becker 2010 ) . The problem includes the context where issues and parameters are defined , followed by an explanation of the challenge for designing an engineering solution that would meet a need , including key design criteria and constraints . The engineering challenge should be open - ended , flexible , and intended to teach the engineering design process by emulating the practices of an engineer engaged in designing a solution . Instructionally , the solution could be a working prototype , or , as in this study a design - no - build description of the engineering solution . The Year 1 engineering design challenge asked students to design a device to assist physically impaired elderly nursing home residents in opening a stuck double - hung win - dow without the use of an external energy source . This design challenge is typical of the 317 High school pre‑engineering students’ engineering design… 1 3 type presented to high school pre - engineering students , and is the same as that used in pre - vious research ( Williams et al . 2011 ) . As such it provides a meaningful basis for compar - ing findings across studies and populations . The Year 2 design challenge tasked the high school students with designing a device to assist wheelchair - bound individuals in accessing objects located on shelves in an overhead cabinet . As with the first design challenge , this one has also been used in previous research ( Gero et al . 2013 ) . Student dyads collaborated on the design challenge within a 45 - min timeframe and were instructed to provide a detailed sketch of their solution on the whiteboard . Each member of the dyad was equipped with a lapel microphone to ensure capture of quality audio . Two video recording devices located at different vantage points ( whiteboard and general ) cap - tured student interactions . Video recordings captured student dyad engagement throughout the entire design - only session . Participants Forty participating high school students in this longitudinal study were drawn from three rural mid - Atlantic high schools , all of which offered the same Project Lead The Way ( PLTW ) pre - engineering curriculum ( https : / / www . pltw . org ) . PLTW is a national program delivering pre - engineering curricula in over 8 , 000 schools throughout the United States offering “a well - designed and well - implemented education program that appears to inter - est and motivate students in science and engineering” ( Tai 2012 , p . 6 ) . This high school course sequence begins with foundation courses—Introduction to Engineering ( IED ) and Principles Of Engineering ( POE ) —and progresses to specialized courses ( Aerospace , Bio - logical , Civil , etc . ) . High school participants were solicited in the fall of their junior year and assigned to experiment and control groups , comprised of those with ( experiment ) and without ( control ) formal pre - engineering course experiences . Formal PLTW experiences ranged from one previous year of coursework to being enrolled in a pre - engineering course at the start of their junior year . At minimum , all pre - engineering participants had or were completing the first course in the sequence ( IED ) , which follows a 10 - Unit course outline expressly stating that students will be “introduced to the engineering design process…” and work collaboratively to “develop and document design solutions” ( PLTW 2016 , p . 2 ) . The final unit is Design Challenges where students are tasked with completing a design - no - build CAD project . Students in the control group had no such prior formal pre - engineering experiences . Both groups had the same number of students ; the gender distribution of both groups was 65 % male and 35 % female . Data collection and analysis The basic methodology of the protocol analysis method consisted of the following sequence of tasks : videoing of participants , transcription of verbalization into text , seg - mentation / coding of transcribed utterances , arbitration of segmentation / coding , and data analysis . The video recording involved capturing voice , sketching and gestures ( Fig . 2 ) . Experience demonstrated that we needed to capture all three of these to allow us to be clear about the later segmentation and coding . Previously , various voice - to - text pro - grams have been tried in order to automate this activity . They have had some suc - cess when used with a single designer but have had very limited success with a team 318 M . D . Lammi et al . 1 3 of designers because of the variability of the voices . Consequently , this transcription process was performed manually and resulted in a time - stamped , digital version of the verbalizations in a session . Segmentation involves collecting into a single unit those verbalizations that cohere with each other . There are a number of possible bases for segmentation . The simplest is based on time ; i . e . , all segments have the same length of time . In this project seg - mentation was on the basis of FBS coding . Each segment can contain only one code ( Kan and Gero 2009 ) . Using this coding scheme harmonizes all segmentation because it provides an isomorphism between segments and codes . This is a critically important advance in protocol analysis resulting in the two previously separate processes of seg - mentation and coding of segments being now a single process . The segments can be connected to time through the time - stamped text constituents of the segments . Consistent , reliable coding of transcripts is achieved by using at least two trained segmenters / coders to produce all initially segmented / coded protocols . Final arbitra - tions for each protocol are conducted by the entire research team and provide further inter - coder consistency and reliability . Since the reliability of the coding is based on comparing the results of each individual coder with the final arbitrated coding , Cohen’s kappa is not used as the reliability measure . Typical coder reliability obtained by this method ranged consistently between 80 and 90 % . These final protocols then served as the data sets available for analysis . The effect of this process is to transform qualitative visual and auditory information into a sequence of symbols drawn from the FBS ontol - ogy . This sequence of symbols can now be quantitatively analyzed using the array of tools available for analyzing symbol sequences to produce models of design cognition . The final protocol for a 45 - min design session typically generated between 350 and 800 segments , and provided a rich and statistically robust data set . The final protocols were analyzed using LINKODER ( https : / / sites . googl e . com / a / linko der . com / linko der / ) to generate descriptive statistics and inferential analyses based on the FBS ontology . Analyses were conducted to identify statistically significant differences in both design issues and processes between the experiment and control group . This provided the foundation for cognitive insight into the different cohorts in terms of the distributions of cognitive effort . Fig . 2 A frame from the video of pre - engineering students designing 319 High school pre‑engineering students’ engineering design… 1 3 Results and analyses Pre‑engineering versus non‑engineering aggregated results The first analysis compared the 20 pre - engineering ( experiment ) to the 20 non - engineering ( control ) high school students within and between Years 1 and 2 for the whole design ses - sion . The percent occurrence of total segments associated with each design issue for each group is shown in Fig . 3 . As with most novice designers , both groups of high school stu - dents spent the largest amount of cognitive effort on structure ( 40 – 45 % ) and behavior from structure ( 26 – 34 % ) ( Gero et al . 2013 ; Lee et al . 2012 ) . There are relatively low percentages of focus on problem - related aspects of design : requirement , function , and expected behav - ior issues . An independent t test , p < 0 . 05 , was performed on the experiment and control groups’ design issues across the whole design session for both Years 1 and 2 . No statistical differ - ences in cognitive effort were found between these two groups for either year ( Table 1 ) . 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Requirement Function Exp . Behavior Str .

D . Lammi et al . 1 3 Additionally , there were no significant differences between groups in cognitive effort expended in the problem and solution spaces ( P – S Issue Index ) for both years , which reflects the relative effort designers spend on problem versus solution issues . The percent occurrences for all eight design processes across the whole design session for the experimental and control groups across both years are presented in Fig . 4 . Similar to the design issues results , the pre - engineering and non - engineering high school students expended the majority of their time focused on processes related to solutions : reformu - lation I ( 29 – 41 % ) , analysis ( 18 – 31 % ) , evaluation ( 6 – 13 % ) , and synthesis ( 5 – 12 % ) . Their percentages are relatively low on syntactic design processes related to the problem space : formulation , reformulation II , and reformulation III . An independent t - test , p < 0 . 05 , was also performed for all eight syntactic design pro - cesses between groups and no statistically significant differences in Year 1 or Year 2 were found ( Table 2 ) .

These results provide motivation for a more detailed analysis . Pre‑engineering versus non‑engineering partitioned results To more accurately assess cognitive effort throughout the entire design session , additional analyses were conducted on data partitioned into equally contiguous fractions of the origi - nal protocol . The first partition divided data into two equal halves , and the second partition divided data into three equal thirds . Analysis of partitioned data provided a mechanism for generating a more refined comparison of design issues and processes within specific peri - ods of time during the design session ; e . g . , beginning , middle , and end phases of the design session . As a result , these refined comparisons produced a more accurate reflection of the differences in cognitive effort between the experiment and control group . Design issues : partitioned Design issue data for both experiment and control groups were analyzed with independent t - tests in two fractions ( 1st Half and 2nd Half ) and three equal contiguous fractions of the original protocol ( 1st Third , 2nd Third , and 3rd Third ) . There were no statistical differences found between pre - engineering and non - engi - neering students’ design issues for Year 1 and 2 when partitioned in halves and analyzed , Table 3 . However , there was statistical significance when the design issues were analyzed in three contiguous parts for expected behavior ( Be ) , function ( F ) , and P – S Issue Index for the 2nd third in Year 1 and expected behavior ( Be ) in the 3rd third for Year 2 , Table 4 . Design processes : partitioned Design processes data were also analyzed with independent t - tests in equal 1st Half and 2nd Half fractions , and in equal contiguous 1st Third , 2nd Third , and 3rd Third fractions ( Table 5 ) .

Significance was found on Analysis for Year 1 in the 1st half , p = 0 . 0225 . As was the case with design issues , there was statistical significance when the design processes were analyzed in three contiguous parts . These included for Year 1 : Synthesis , Analysis , Reformulation II , and P – S Process Index during the 2nd Third and Formulation during the 3rd Third ; Evaluation and P – S Process Index during the 3rd Third for Year 2 , Table 6 . Results related to the hypotheses The results of this study revealed significant differences in design issues , processes , and the cognitive effort in the problem / solution spaces between the two high school student groups when the design sessions were partitioned in two and three equal contiguous frac - tions . Table 7 displays the results as they relate to each of the six hypotheses guiding this research . Hypotheses 1 , 2 , and 6 contend that students with formal pre - engineering experience will have a stronger focus than non - engineering students on the design processes of Syn - thesis and Analysis , and on the Problem Space as measured by the P – S Issues and Process Index . Except for a single data point , analysis of data when partitioned into halves did not detect significant differences between participant groups . However , analysis of data parti - tioned into thirds reveals that significant differences consistently arose Year 1 during the 2nd Third . As might be expected , pre - engineering students did demonstrate a significantly stronger focus on the design process of Analysis ( Hypothesis 2 ) early in the design session . Not expected however , were statistically significant differences in the opposite direction for both the design process of Synthesis ( Hypothesis 1 ) and the Problem Space ( Hypothesis 6 ) . Specifically , in Year 1 non - engineering students demonstrated a stronger focus on produc - ing solutions as compared to pre - engineering high school students without formal design Table 5 Pre - versus non - engineering high school students’ design processes partitioned in halves for Years 1 and 2 * Denotes statistical significance p < 0 . 05 Process Year 1 Year 2 1st Half 2nd Half 1st Half 2nd Half t p t p t p t p Formulation 0 . 8 . 2185 1 . 35 . 0996 − 1 . 16 . 2631 0 . 29 . 7721 Synthesis − 1 . 17 . 1291 − 0 . 59 . 2817 − 0 . 95 . 3571 − 1 . 15 . 2774 Analysis 2 . 16 . 0225 * 0 . 38 . 3644 0 . 95 . 3537 − 0 . 65 . 5242 Evaluation 0 . 44 . 334 − 0 . 54 . 2988 0 . 11 . 917 − 1 . 38 . 1832 Documentation 0 . 76 . 228 0 . 75 . 2306 0 . 05 . 959 1 . 3 . 2111 Reformulation I − 0 . 89 . 1933 0 . 09 . 4647 0 . 04 . 9706 0 . 54 . 5942 Reformulation II − 1 . 11 . 14 − 1 . 37 . 0936 − 1 . 18 . 2518 − 1 . 06 . 3017 Reformulation III − 0 . 19 . 4245 0 . 94 . 1809 0 . 34 . 7375 − 1 . 49 . 1545 P – S process Index − 0 . 71 . 2424 − 0 . 53 . 3021 − 1 . 29 . 2132 − 1 . 63 . 1205 324 M .

Hypotheses 3 , 4 , and 5 predict that high school students without formal pre - engineer - ing experience will have a stronger focus than those with formal experience on the design issues of Structure and Expected Behavior , as well as the design process of Evaluation . Given there were no statistically significant differences on the design issue of Structure , Hypothesis 3 was rejected . The fourth hypothesis states those with less design experi - ence ( non - engineering students ) focus on how the design is meant to perform , rather than on how the design does perform . There was statistical significance on the design issue Expected Behavior ( Be ) Year 1 in the middle and Year 2 in the final third partitions , giving support to Hypothesis 4 . Furthermore , the non - engineering students had more instances of Expected Behavior for all analyses regardless of whether partitioned in halves , thirds , or non - partitioned , as well as across both Years 1 and 2 . Data analyzed to address Hypothesis 5 revealed statistical significance in the 3rd Third of Year 2 , giving support to the predic - tion that non - engineering students would have a stronger focus on the design process of Evaluation . Although not included in the hypotheses , there were statistical differences on the design issue Function and the design processes Formulation and Reformulation II ; with the pre - engineering students having a stronger focus on each of these areas . These cognitive pro - cesses are typically problem - space oriented . Discussion There was no statistical significance for the design issues , processes , and the P – S indi - ces from the analysis of the aggregated results when measured across the design session timeframe as a whole . Nonetheless , as the results were partitioned across time , statistical significance of the distribution of efforts became manifest towards various fractions at the middle and end of the design sessions . Consistent with the hypotheses , the pre - engineering students consistently expended less cognitive effort on the design issue Expected Behavior as did the control group across both years . This trend became statistically significant towards the middle and end periods of the 45 - min design sessions . Correspondingly , the control group expended more cognitive effort on the design process Synthesis and was statistically significant during the middle of the session in Year 1 . The pre - engineering students also expended more statistically significant cognitive effort on the design process Analysis . This signifies that the students with formal design experiences tended towards front - loading the analysis of their design ideas . These find - ings correlate with literature reporting that more advanced designerly ways of thinking tend toward more analysis . Novices tend to generate more ideas but engage in analysis to understand the ideas further ( Kavakli and Gero 2002 ) . The results for Synthesis parallel the findings for the issues of Expected Behavior and Structure since Synthesis is the transition of Expected Behavior to Structure . It might be that the non pre - engineering high school students had more instances of developing ideas , but appeared not able to analyze them due to a lack of skills . These findings do not suggest that the pre - engineering students were expert in engineering design , but rather they were further on the continuum towards exper - tise than the non - engineering high school students on specific measures . 327 High school pre‑engineering students’ engineering design… 1 3 The P – S issue and process indices were generally lower for the pre - engineering students across both years , with statistical significance toward the middle and end fractions . A lower index number signifies more cognitive efforts in the solution space rather than the prob - lem space . This is contrary to the sixth hypothesis and the majority of the literature . For instance , Gero et al . ( 2013 ) found that individuals having more design experience expend greater effort in the problem space , Atman et al . ( 2007 ) found that experts spend more time problem scoping , and Mentzer and Becker ( 2010 ) noted that high school students put less effort into gathering information and problem scoping . There was statistical significance for the design process Evaluation during the last fraction on Year 2 . Evaluation is the design process of going between the design issues Expected Behavior and Behavior derived from Structure . Additionally , the control group had more statistically significant efforts on the design process Reformulation II . Conclusions Learning theory indicates new knowledge is gained by building on prior knowledge , inclu - sive of preconceptions and pre - existing language ( Bransford et al . 2000 ) . It follows then that integral to effective instruction is affording learners the opportunities requisite to the construction of new knowledge whereby they adjust , reject , and then modify their prior understandings resulting from the educational experience ( Prince and Felder 2006 ) . Based on findings , there are particular designerly differences between students who receive pre - engineering design education and those who do not . Specifically , students without design education do not have the necessary prior knowledge to move beyond design processes ; they expend more cognitive effort on the design process of synthesis , demonstrating prolonged engagement in the ideation phase of design and depending more on declarative and procedural knowledge ( the what and how ) in their efforts to design . In contrast , students with pre - engineering education progress more quickly through the initial phases of a design task , and tend to expend more cognitive effort on design process analy - sis and the solution space ; their focus is more on deciding why ( strategic knowledge ) a given potential design option would provide a viable solution . What can be concluded from this research is that the design education received by the pre - engineering students was instrumental in further developing their engineering design abilities , which when confronted with a novel design - only challenge , they were able to utilize . Moreover , in so doing , they were demonstrating the ability to capitalize on their designerly preconceptions and pre - existing language of design . Implications for pre‑engineering education Given there is access to a growing body of curricula designed to intentionally engage stu - dents in the design process , the expectation is classroom instructors are adequately pre - pared to implement that curriculum and facilitate student development of design thinking . In light of this , an important pedagogical implication not to be overlooked is that of teacher preparation . Regrettably , a review of the technology and engineering teacher certification programs in the U . S . ( Litowitz 2014 ) found that a very small percentage require pre - ser - vice teachers to take a course in engineering design , which indicates that adequate pre - engineering teacher preparation is an issue . Independent of certified teacher preparation 328 M . D . Lammi et al . 1 3 programs , engineering program such as PLTW require in - service technology and engineer - ing teachers to participate in only a two - week professional development to become quali - fied for delivering an entry - level course in the PLTW Engineering Curriculum . This mini - mal professional development time brings into question whether this level of pedagogical preparation is sufficient for an educator to intentionally incorporate engineering design and to promote design thinking as part of a student’s pre - engineering design experiences . The issue of insufficient pre - engineering teacher preparation is exacerbated given the Next Generation Science Standards ( NGSS Lead States 2013 ) now requires science educators to incorporate engineering design practices as part of science teaching , even though their pre - service programs do not prepare them for teaching engineering design . The use of a task - independent approach to protocol analysis allows for the evaluation of educational effects on design cognition across a range of contexts . This approach provided the basis for the research conducted in this study and findings revealed positive outcomes regarding pre - engineering education as an effective pedagogical intervention for promoting student development of cognitive abilities . Furthermore , recognition of pedagogical inter - ventions as being inherently complex , this study provides a unique point of departure for continuing this line of cognitive research .
