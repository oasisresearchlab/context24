Jorgensen 1 To sustain neurotransmission , synaptic vesicles and their associated proteins must be recycled locally at synapses . Synaptic vesicles are thought to be regenerated approximately 20 s after fusion by the assembly of clathrin scaffolds or in approximately 1 s by the reversal offusion pores via ‘kiss - and - run’ endocytosis . Here we use optogenetics to stimu - late cultured hippocampal neurons with a single stimulus , rapidly freeze them after fixed intervals and examine the ultrastructure using electron microscopy—‘flash - and - freeze’ electron microscopy . Docked vesicles fuse and collapse into the membrane within 30 ms of the stimulus . Compensatory endocytosis occurs within 50 to 100 ms at sites flanking the active zone . Invagination is blocked by inhibition of actin polymerization , and scission is blocked by inhibiting dynamin . Because intact synaptic vesicles are not recovered , this form of recycling is not compatible with kiss - and - run endocytosis ; moreover , it is 200 - fold faster than clathrin - mediated endocytosis . It is likely that ‘ultrafast endocytosis’ is specialized to restore the surface area of the membrane rapidly . Recyclingofsynapticvesiclemembraneandproteinsisrequiredtokeepmembranesurfaceareaconstantandensureefficientneurotransmis - sionduringsustainedsynapticactivity . Classicalultrastructuralanalysis of frog neuromuscular junctions led to two models of endocytosis . A slow endocytic pathway that takes place distant from active zones via clathrin scaffolds , 20 s after exocytosis was proposed 1 . A fast mecha - nism , now termed kiss - and - run , that retrieves fusing vesicles by rever - singtheirneckwasthensuggested 2 , 3 —aprocessthattakesplacewithin 1 s 4 – 6 . Since then , many studies have focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms and the kinetics of endocytosis to distinguish thesetwomodels . However , conflictingevidencehas accumulatedover the past 40years . Thestudiesonthemolecularmechanismssuggestthatproteinsasso - ciatedwith clathrin play crucial roles in synaptic vesicle endocytosis 7 , 8 . Purified clathrin and its adaptor proteins are sufficient to reconstitute vesicles from brain - derived liposomes 9 . When cleavage by dynamin is disrupted , clathrin - coated pits and coated vesicles accumulate at the plasma membrane of synapses 10 , 11 . Likewise , reductions of clathrin - interacting adaptor proteins 12 – 15 , membrane - curvature proteins 16 – 18 or scaffolding proteins 19 – 21 perturb endocytosis at the synapse . On the other hand , the recruitment of clathrin triskelia is known to be very slow—on a time scale of seconds 22 , making it difficult to reconcile how vesicles can be regenerated when firing rates exceed 100Hz 23 . More - over , functional vesicles are still regenerated in the absence of clathrin or its adaptor proteins 13 , 24 , suggesting that another pathway may be operating at synapses . The conclusions from studies on kinetics of endocytosis are often contradictory , but in some cases suggest that both kiss - and - run and clathrin - mediated endocytosis are operational at the synapse . Fluid - phase uptake of fluorescent dyes 5 , 25 , 26 or measurements of open times using quantum dots 4 , 27 show two kinetic components : fast ( 1 – 2 s ) and slow ( , 20 s ) , although some authors have reported only a single kine - tic component 28 . Dye release of vesicles during exocytosis indicates that some dye is retained in the vesicle and suggests the presence of a transient fusion pore thatopens during kiss - and - run 4 , 5 , 26 . Capacitance measurementsfromthecalyxofHeld 29 , retinalbipolarcells 6 , andhippo - campal mossy fibre boutons 30 suggest that both fast and slow mecha - nisms are probably at work . On the other hand , the measurement of protein trafficking using the pH - sensitive fluorescent protein pHluorin suggests that endocytosis of vesicle proteins in mammalian central syna - psesoccurswithasingletimeconstantof15s 31 , 32 , similartothetimecourse revealed byultrastructuralanalysis ofthe clathrin - mediated pathway 1 .

Somecells ( 20 % , 7 / 34 ) firedasecond action potential within 30 ms of light - on as illustrated in the sample trace ( Fig . 1a ) . No action potential was observed in 12 % of the cells ( 4 / 34 ; ExtendedDataFig . 2b ) .

Postsynapticcurrents were observed with a delay of , 6 . 9 6 0 . 3 ms after light - on ( Fig . 1b ) , and were blocked by NBQX and bicuculline ( Fig . 1b , middle trace ) . In paired recordings of isolated ChetaTC positive and negative neurons , alternating light or electrical stimulation in the ChetaTC - positive cell elicitsidenticalpostsynapticcurrents , demonstratingthatinourcondi - tions channelrhodopsin is acting solely via action potential generation , rather than supplementing calcium in the synaptic bouton ( Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . Tocapturesynapticstructuresduringneurotransmission , weapplied a single 10 - ms pulse of blue light , froze the cells using a high - pressure freezer at defined time points ranging from 15 ms up to 10 s after light onset , andpreparedthesamplesforelectronmicroscopy ( ExtendedData Fig . 2d , see Methods ) . To enhance release probability , the external solu - tioncontained4mMcalcium . Omegafiguresoffusingvesicleswereonly rarely observed in unstimulated synapses ( 1 % profiles with no stimu - lation , Fig . 1f ) , whereas they were found in 20 % of synaptic profiles 15 ms after light onset ( , 10 ms after the initiation of an action poten - tial ) . Thus , thesestructuresprobablyrepresentfusionsoccurringduring peak transmission or phasic release ( Fig . 1b ) . Fusions were observed within the active zone ( Fig . 1c – e ) , and the diameters of these pits were similar to those of synaptic vesicles , and thus each pit represents the fusion of a single synaptic vesicle ( Fig . 1g ) . Based on the wide opening at their neck ( Fig . 1c – e ) , these pits are likely to be collapsing into the membrane , and the omega structures perdure for 20ms ( t 5 20 . 3 ms , see Methods ) . Occasionally , multiple pits were observed in single sec - tions ( Fig . 1e ) , indicating that multi - vesicular release can occur in response to a single action potential or tightly spaced action potentials ( 20 % of stimulated cells , Fig . 1a and Extended Data Fig . 2b ) . In either case , the presenceofmultiple fusingvesicles indicatesthatthefusion of a second vesicle is not blocked by the preceding fusion event . We defined docked vesicles as those in direct contact with the mem - brane , inadditionwescoredvesicleswithtethersthatwerewithin30nm of the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2a ) . The number of docked vesicles was reduced from 1 . 7 to 1 . 0 per profile after the stimulus , but the tethered poolwaslargelyunaffected ( Fig . 2b – d ) . Thedockedpoolrecoveredwith a time constant of 3 . 8 s ( Fig . 2b ) , which is similar to the time constant ( 4 . 3 s ) for the recovery of the readily releasable pool previously mea - sured in mouse hippocampal neurons by electrophysiology 37 . These data indicate that docked vesicles are likely to be the morphological correlates of the physiologically defined readily - releasable pool . Endocytosis peaks at 100 ms Following exocytosis , endocytic structures appeared adjacent to the active zone ( Fig . 3 and Fig . 4 ; Extended Data Fig . 4 for more example electronmicrographs ) . Shallowpits ( , 40nm ) , deeppits ( . 40nm ) , and fully internalized vesicles ( . 50 nm ) were all observed within 50 ms afterstimulationandweredecliningby300ms ( Fig . 3a – d , i ) . Thenumber of shallow and deep pits increases again at 1 s , indicating a possible secondary wave of endocytosis . The diameters of these endocytic pits and large vesicles are similar ( 86 6 2 . 4 nm and 82 6 1 . 2 nm , respec - tively ) , suggestingaprecursor – productrelationshipbetweenthesestruc - tures ( Fig . 3h ) .

To confirm the spatial relationship of exocytic and endocytic sites , we performed electron tomography on 200 - nm thick sections at 50ms and 100ms after stimulation ( Fig . 4 ) . Fusing vesicles , defined by their diameter , were rare and were not observed in the 100 - ms tomograms ( Fig . 4a ) . Endocytic invaginations were outside the active zone and were often observed flanking the active zone ( Fig . 4b , e ) . The number of shallow invaginations declines at 100ms and is associated with an increaseinthenumberofdeeppitsandlargevesicles ( Fig . 4c ) similarto the 40 - nm sections ( Fig . 3i ) . The diameters of pits ( 76 . 3 6 1 . 9 nm ) and largevesicles ( 78 . 0 6 3 . 3nm ) aresimilar , againsuggestingaprecursor – product relationship ( Fig . 4d ) . One potential interpretation of these data is that synaptic vesicles firstundergohomotypiccompoundfusiontogeneratealargevesicle 38 , 39 , and then fuse to the plasma membrane . To exclude such a possibility we used ferritin as a fluid phase marker to label endocytic structures . Cationizedferritin bindsto negative chargeson the plasmamembrane and becomes internalized by endocytosis . Ferritin - positive synaptic vesicleswereonlyrarelyobservedintheabsenceofstimulation ( Extended Data Fig . 5a ; control no stimulation , see Methods ) . Cells were stimu - lated with a single light pulse and frozen 100ms later . After stimula - tion , ferritinwasfoundininvaginations ( 22 % ofthesynapses ) andlarge vesicles ( 16 % of the synapses ; Fig . 3e – g and Extended Data Fig . 5c – e for more example micrographs ) . The frequencies of endocytic struc - tures were similar to matched controls with no ferritin , thus ferritin itselfdidnotaffectultrafastendocytosis ( ExtendedDataFig . 5f , g ) . The presenceofferritininlargevesiclesbutnotsynapticvesicles ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) indicates that these large structures are due to endocy - tosis rather than compound fusion , and further indicates that synaptic vesicles are not being regenerated directly from the membrane on this time scale . 50 ms after stimulation 50 ms after stimulation 50 ms after stimulation PSDPSD 100 ms after stimulation 100 ms after stimulation 100 ms after stimulation 100 ms after stimulation 300 ms after stimulation PSDPSD PSDPSD PSDPSD c b a ccc bbb aaa c d b a 100 nm 100 nm 100 nm 100 nm gg ff ee g f e Pits and vesicles diameter h D i a m e t e r ( n m ) E n d o c y t i c p i t s L a r g e v e s i c l e s 40 0 20 60 n . s . 80 N o s t i m 100 m s ( n o C h e t a T C ) 10 s 3 s 1 s 300 m s 100 m s Time after light onset 50 m s 15 m s 30 m s N u m b e r p i t s p e r L V p e r sy n a p t i c p r o fi l e 0 . 2 0 0 . 1 N u m b e r p i t s p e r L V p e r sy n a p t i c p r o fi l e 0 . 2 0 0 . 1 N o s t i m 100 m s Time after light onset 30 m s Number endocytic structures in WT cells Number endocytic structures in Munc13 DKO Ø Ø ØØ Ø i j Shallowpits Deeppits LV < 50 nm from membrane Figure 3 | Large invaginations immediately next to the active zone are endocytic intermediates . a – d , Representative micrographs showing invaginations and large vesicles in the periactive zone at 50ms ( a ) , 100ms ( b , c ) and 300ms ( d ) after stimulation . e – g , Sample micrographs showing ferritin uptake into these large endocytic structures at 100ms after stimulation . h , Diameter of large vesicles ( 82 . 0 6 1 . 2nm ; n 5 572 ) and endocytic invaginations ( 86 . 0 6 2 . 4nm ; n 5 51 ; P 5 0 . 33 ) . i , Number of shallow pits ( , 40nm ) , deep pits ( . 40nm ) , and large vesicles ( LV ; , 50nm from plasma membrane ) in the periactive zone at different time points after stimulation . j , Number of shallow pits , deep pits and large vesicles in the periactive zone at different time points after stimulation in Munc13 DKO .

All rights reserved ©201 3 Ultrafast endocytosis scales with exocytosis Some data suggest that calcium influx may be able to stimulate endo - cytosis without vesicle fusion 40 . To test if calcium influx alone can sti - mulate ultrafast endocytosis , we repeated the experiment in cultured neuronsfromMunc13 - 1Munc13 - 2doublemutants ( Munc13 - 1 / 2DKO ) , which should still experience calcium influx but lack synaptic vesicle exocytosis athippocampal synapses 41 , 42 . We applieda single lightpulse to Munc13 - 1 / 2 DKO hippocampal neurons expressing ChetaTC and froze the sampleat0ms , 30ms and 100ms . Thenumber of docked vesi - cleswassignificantlyreducedaspreviouslyobserved 41 , 42 , andnoexocytic omega structures were observed . Endocytic structureswere completely absent in Munc13 - 1 / 2 DKO cells ( Fig . 3j ) . Thus , ultrafast endocytosis requires the addition of membrane to the surface via exocytosis and is not solely driven by calcium . Nevertheless , increasing calcium is known to accelerate endocytosis during synaptic activity 43 . In our experiments we used 4mM calcium to increase release probability ; it is possible that ultrafast endocytosis depends on elevated intracellular calcium . We therefore repeated the experiments using 2 mM calcium in the external solution ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . At least one action potential during the light pulse was observed in 73 % of cells ( 11 / 15 ; Extended Data Fig . 6a , b ) . Endocytic intermediates were captured at the lateral edge of active zone 100ms after stimulation ( Extended Data Fig . 6c – e ) . The number of exocytic events and endocytic events was lower than the number observed with 4mMcalcium ( ExtendedDataFig . 6f , g ) . However , thekineticsofendo - cytosiswerenotaltered . Theseresults indicate that ultrafastendocytosis occurs under physiological conditions , but scales with the amount of membrane added by exocytosis . Todetermineifultrafastendocytosiscanfullycompensateformem - brane added during exocytosis , wecompared the surface area added by exocytosis to that removed by endocytosis ( see Methods ) . The number of fused vesicles was determined by comparing docked vesicles at the 0 ms and 15 ms time points . We calculated that 3 , 700nm 2 of mem - brane was added to the surface per each profile . The amount of mem - brane endocytosed at 100ms was 3 , 150nm 2 . In short , we observe that 0 . 7 synaptic vesicles fuse per profile and 0 . 6 vesicle equivalents are recovered per profile . These data indicate that a majority of the mem - brane added by full - collapse fusion after a single stimulus is retrieved by ultrafast endocytosis . Actin and dynamin mediate endocytosis Someformsofendocytosis , eitherclathrin - dependentor - independent , are mediated by actin 44 . To investigate the role of actin polymerization inultrafastendocytosis , weappliedlatrunculin - A ( Fig . 5 ) , whichdisrupts polymerization of actin 45 . Application of 0 . 1 % dimethylsulphoxide ( DMSO ) or10 m Mlatrunculin - Afor1 mindidnotaffectevokedneuro - transmission ( Fig . 5d and Extended Data Fig . 7a , b ) . Hippocampal neurons treated with either latrunculin - A or DMSO for 30 s were frozen 100 ms after light stimulation ( Fig . 5a , b and Extended Data Fig . 7c – h for more representative micrographs ) . The DMSO - treated neurons showed normal endocytosis ( Fig . 5b , e ) . No endocytic struc - tures were observed in the latrunculin - A treated cells ( Fig . 5a , e ) , indi - cating that polymerized actin is required for ultrafast endocytosis . Cleavageofbuddedvesiclesfromtheplasmamembraneisassociated withthe GTPasedynamin 10 , 11 . Dynasore isa smallmoleculethatinter - feres with the GTPase activity of dynamin and blocks the cleavage of membrane necks 46 , but may also affect the actin cytoskeleton 47 . We applied 80 m M dynasore for 30 s before freezing . Unstimulated neu - rons treated with dynasore did not accumulate pits , indicating that spontaneousactivitydoesnotcontributesubstantiallytotrappedendo - cytic intermediates ( Fig . 5f ; 0 . 1 pits or large vesicles per profile in both treatedandcontrol ) . Inculturesstimulatedbyasinglepulseoflightand frozen100mslater , dynasoretreatmentdidnotincreasethetotalnumber of endocytic structures , indicating that dynasore did not increase exo - cytosisandtherebyindirectlyincreaseendocyticstructures ( Fig . 5f ; 0 . 4 endocytic structures per profile in treated and control ) . However , the fraction of structures remaining as large vesicles trapped close to the membrane increased ( Fig . 5f ; control : 0 . 09 large vesicles per profile , treated : 0 . 16largevesicles ) . By1 safterstimulation , theendocyticstruc - tureshadprogressedtolargevesicles , butremainedassociatedwiththe membrane in dynasore - treated samples ( control : 0 . 06 large vesicles , treated : 0 . 22 large vesicles ; Fig . 5c , f and Extended Data Fig . 8a – c for moremicrographs ) . Neckswereonlyvisiblein18 % ofthetrappedlarge vesicles ( 10 / 57 ) , possibly due to the thickness of the sections ( 40 nm ) . Electron tomography revealed that the large vesicles were still attached to the membrane ( Extended Data Fig . 8d – f ) , indicating that these large vesicles are trapped on the surface . Together , these results indicate that endocytosis in hippocampal neurons occurs within 100ms lateral to the active zone , and is mediated by actin polymerization and dynamin . Discussion It is widely agreed that after high - frequency stimulation , membranes andproteinsareretrievedbyclathrin 7 , 48 . Thebestestimatesforthespeed of clathrin - mediated endocytosis at the synapse come from vesicle proteins tagged with pHluorin . Synaptic vesicle proteins freshly added to the surface after a single action potential are recycled with a time constant of about15 – 20 s 31 , 32 . In addition , a fraction of vesicleproteins already reside on the plasma membrane and are only endocytosed after stimulation 49 .

Theserates are slowcomparedtoultra - fast endocytosis , which is 200 times faster , but the assembly kinetics of clathrin are known to be slow 22 . It is too premature to eliminate a role for clathrin in ultrafast endocytosis ; the absence of distinctive clathrin coats does not exclude a role for clathrin in ultrafast endocytosis . Thereisalargebodyofevidenceforafastpathwayattributedtokiss - and - run endocytosis 5 , 25 , 26 . Ultrafast endocytosis is not kiss - and - run becauseofthreecharacteristics : first , thevesiclefusionsweobservehave broad openings , suggesting they are collapsing into the membrane . Second , ultrafast endocytosistakes place atthelateral edge of the active zone , rather than in the middle of the active zone where fusion takes place . Third , the surface area of the invaginations is equivalent to four synaptic vesicles rather than one vesicle . It is unlikely that these large vesicles represent the recovery of intact synaptic vesicles . Nevertheless , kiss - and - run events should be captured in our pre - paration , because they are thought to be more abundant during low - frequency stimulation 2 , and the pore is estimatedto last approximately 1 – 2s 5 . Thus kiss - and - run vesicles should be visible in the preparation atalltimepointsbetween15msand1 s . However , theporeisestimated tobeonly1 – 2nmindiameter 2 , 5 . Althoughsuchaporehasbeenobserved previously by electron microscopy 2 , 3 , such small structures would be difficulttoobserveroutinelyin40 - nmthicksections . Wecannotexclude thepossibility of kiss - and - run figures inour micrographs . However , itis unlikely that kiss - and - run constitutes a significant fraction of endocytic events in our preparation : presumably kiss - and - run vesicles would become undocked after stimulation , and our calculations of mem - brane surface area suggest that ultrafast endocytosis can account for most docked vesicles lost to fusion after a single stimulus . Ultrafast endocytosis is likely to be an evolutionarily conserved pro - cess . At the frog neuromuscular junction , depressions adjacent to the activezonewereobservedinfreeze - fracturestudies1safterstimulation 33 ; these depressions were interpreted as a potentially fast form of endo - cytosis . Capacitance measures in retinal bipolar cells indicate that a fast form of endocytosis ( t 5 1 s ) is clathrin - independent 6 . Ultrastruc - turalstudies at C . elegans neuromuscular junctionsindicatethatendo - cytosis can be as fast as 50 ms following a single stimulus and also occurs at the lateral edges of the active zone 34 . The data presented here suggestthatultrafastendocytosisalmostinstantaneouslycompensatesformembraneaddedtotheplasmamembrane . The rapid communi - cation between fusion in the active zone and the endocytic sites at the lateraledgesisprobablymediatedbyarelaxationinmembranetension .

Cellswere infectedusinglentivirusexpressing channelrhodopsin - 2 ( E123T / T159C ) . Experiments were performed after 13 – 15days in culture . Action poten - tials were recorded in the cell - attached voltage clamp configuration after a single 10 - ms light stimulus in 34 u C HEPES - buffered solution containing 4mM Ca 2 1 , 1mM Mg 2 1 , 3 m M NBQX and 30 m M bicuculline . For measuring synaptic delay and effects of latrunculin - A , we infected 20 % of cellswithmKateand80 % ofcellswithChetaTC , co - culturedtheinfectedcells , and patched mKate - positive cells that lacked photocurrents . Whole - cell patch clamp recordings were conducted at 34 u C in the absence of NBQX or bicuculline . For electron microscopy , neurons were grown on 6 - mm sapphire disks . The neurons were transferred into the same extracellular solutions , 30s before free - zing . A single 10 - ms light pulse was applied at defined time points before high - pressurefreezing . Followingfreeze - substitution , enblocstainingwithuranylacetate and plastic embedding , serial 40 - nm sections were collected . The samples were blinded before imaging and analysis . Approximately 200 synaptic profiles were randomly chosen from each time point and analysed blind . For electron tomography , 200 - nm thick sections were collected . Tilt series of 6 65 u wereacquired , andtomogramsgeneratedusingIMOD . Membraneswere segmented using Amira or TrakEM2 . For ferritin uptake experiments , cells were immersed in solution containing 0 . 25mgml 2 1 ferritin for 5min in reduced external calcium solution ( 1mM ) to suppress spontaneous activity . For latrunculin - A and dynasore experiments , we applied a solution containing 10 m M latrunculin or 80 m M dynasore or 0 . 1 % DMSO 30s before stimulation and freezing .

Priortoadditionofhippocampalneurons , culture medium was changed to Neurobasal - A supplemented with 2 % B27 , 0 . 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( NB - A full medium , Invitrogen ) . Virus production was performed as described previously 50 . Briefly , HEK293T cellsweretransfectedinT - 75flaskswithaplasmidencodingchannelrhodopsin - 2 ( E123T / T159C ; ChetaTC ) undercontrolofaneuron - specificsynapsinpromoter , andthehelperplasmidspCMVdR8 . 9andpVSV . G ( 5 m geach ) withX - tremeGENE 9 DNA transfection reagent ( Roche ) . These modifications to channelrhodopsin - 2 increase the maximal current and off - kinetics of the light - activated channel 35 , 36 . Cultures were maintained in NB - A full medium in an incubator at 32 u C and 5 % CO 2 for 72 h . Supernatant was harvested , filtered , concentrated to 500 m l using AmiconUltra - 15centrifugal10kDafilterunitsandshock - frozeninliquidnitrogen . 25 m l of concentrated virus was used to transduce neurons at DIV1 - 2 . Infection rates reached 100 % , as monitored by yellow fluorescence protein ( YFP ) fluore - scence and whole - cell current - clamp recordings . Forelectrophysiologicalexperimentsusingco - culturesofChetaTC - positiveand - negative cells , one set of hippocampal neurons was cultured as described above andinfected6 – 24hpostseeding . Anewsetofneuronswasprepared2 – 4dayslater and incubated for 2 – 3 h in suspension with a lentivirus encoding mKate2 . Sub - sequently , neurons were washed twice with NB - A full medium to remove viral particles , andaddedatlowconcentrationstotheneuronsexpressingChetaTC . For paired recordings on co - cultures of ChetaTC positive and negative neurons , we modified protocols for autaptic neuronal cultures 51 . In six - well plates , hippocam - palneurons were seededat low density ( 260cellscm 2 2 ) on astrocyte microislands of500 - m mdiameterandinfectedwithChetaTCvirus . After3days , culturemedium was changed , and uninfected striatal neurons were added at same concentration . Electrophysiology .

All recordings were performed at 34 u C using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier ( Molecular Devices ) under the control of Clampex 10 . 0 ( Molecular Devices ) . Datawasacquired at10kHzandfilteredat3kHz .

Pipette resistance was 3 – 5MOhm , and access resistance was compensated by 70 % . Pipettes contained extracellular solution for cell - attached measurements ofaction - potentialsevokedbylightstimulation . Opticalstimulationwasprovided bya470nmLEDcoupledintothefluorescenceportofthemicroscope ( Olympus - IX51 ) , and triggered by a transistor - transistor logic ( TTL ) signal . The delay between TTL - triggerandlight - onsetisapproximately200 m s . Forourmorphologicalstudies , eachcellonlyreceivedonelightstimulusbeforefreezing , andthus , inthecellattached recordingswerecordedfromcellsthatneverexperiencedlightstimulationbefore , and only applied one light pulse to each cell . Occasionally , multiple action poten - tials were observed during the 10ms application of blue light as illustrated in the sampletrace . Anactionpotentialwasobservedduringthelightpulsein88 % ofthe cells ( 30 / 34 ) . Mean delay was 4 . 8 6 0 . 4ms after light - on . Postsynaptic responses follow , 6 . 9 6 0 . 3ms after the initiation of the light stimulus ( postsynaptic onset measured at 10 % peak current , n 5 27 ) in a ChetaTC - negative neuron , receiving synaptic input from a ChetaTC - positive neuron . The responses were blocked either by tetrodotoxin or by NBQX and bicuculline . For testing the effect of latrunculin - A on evoked release , we recorded from mKate2 - positive cells that did not express ChetaTC ( Extended Data Fig . 7a ) . We measuredlight - evokedpostsynapticcurrentsPSCs4 – 6timestocalculatetheaverage PSC amplitude . After6 pulses of blue lightat 0 . 1Hz under control conditions , we applied0 . 1 % DMSOfor30sandrecordedPSCswiththesamestimulationprotocol . Finally , 10 m M latrunculin - A was applied for 30 s , and 4 – 6 PSCs were measured . Electronmicroscopy . CulturedcellsonsapphirediskswerefrozenusingtheHPM 100 high - pressure freezer ( Leica ) with an integrated light stimulation device . To achieve millisecond temporal control of light application , we built a device that triggersbothlightandfreezing . Wesetthedevicesothatalightstimulusisapplied at 15ms , 30ms , 50ms , 100ms , 300ms , 1s , 3s and 10s before freezing . The cells weremountedinthespecimenmountsatroomtemperature , whichtypicallyrequires 30s to 1min , but were recovered to 34 u C in the chamber before freezing . Endocytosis should stop when the tissue reaches 0 u C . Leica has placed a ther - mister inside their sample cup for the HPM100 and have measured a cooling rate of 6 , 000Ks 2 1 , which predicts that the sample would reach 0 u C in 6ms . We cannotmonitor thetemperatureof the sample , thehigh pressure freezer can only sendtelemetryconcerningthetemperatureofthefreezingchamber . Inourinstru - ment , the chamber reaches 0 u C 7ms after the chamber is flooded with liquid nitrogen . However , therewillbeafurtherdelaycausedbythetimerequiredtocool the sample . The time required for a sample to reach a temperature can be esti - mated by the total heat to be removed from the sampledivided by the rate of heat exchange using the algebraic formula : t ~ ( c m D t 2 ) = ½ ( k A D t 1 ) = d (cid:2) in which t 5 the time required to cool the sample to a particular target tempe - rature ( s ) , c 5 specific heat of the material ( Jg 2 1 K 2 1 ) , m 5 the mass of material ( g ) , k 5 thermalconductivityofthematerial ( Wm 2 1 K 2 1 ) , A 5 areaoftheexposed surface ( m 2 ) , d 5 distance the sample is from the surface ( m ) , D t 1 5 driving tem - perature of coolant ( K ) , and D t 2 5 the target temperature of the sample ( K ) .

If the chambertemperaturewereinstantaneously 2 20 u C , thetemperatureontheinner side of the 100 - m m - thick sapphire disk should reach 0 u C in 0 . 01ms . The cells cultured on the sapphire disk are all within 5 m m of the surface in aqueous media ( c 5 4 . 186 specific heat for water , m 5 0 . 000141 mass of water in the volume , k 5 0 . 56 thermal conductivity of water , A 5 2 . 8 3 10 2 5 area of the disk , d 5 5 3 10 2 6 m distance from the surface , D t 1 5 54 u K assuming the cham - ber is at 253 u K , and D t 2 5 34 u K is the target temperature of 273 u K . This is of courseanoverestimatebecauseitassumesthatthereisnocoolingofthesampleinthefirst7ms . The estimated time for specimens to reach 0 u C is 1 . 1ms . Thus , the sampleshould reach 0 u C inless than8 . 1ms . Simulationsof cooling using a diffe - rentialequationforFourier’slawofheatconductionpredictsthatwater5 m mfrom the surface will reach 0 u C 5ms after the chamber is flooded with liquid nitrogen , whenabrassspecimenholderisusedintheLeicaEMpact 52 . Thetelemetryreported that the chamber temperature drops to 2 20 u C at 8ms . However , because we cannotmonitor thetemperatureof thesample , wehavebasedourcalculationson a target temperature for the chamber of 2 20 u C , which comprises an 8ms delay . Thus , to freeze the sample 15ms after light onset we performed the following protocol ( Extended Data Fig . 2d ) . We fired a single light pulse at 0ms , 7ms after light onset we flooded the chamber with liquid nitrogen , 8ms after application of liquid nitrogen the sample should reach 0 u C ( the chamber temperature will be 2 20 u C ) , so that the sample was frozen 15ms after light onset . Action potentials are initiated 4 . 8ms after light onset on average . Thus , the 15ms freeze captures events that occurred 10 . 2ms after the action potential on average . However these values should not be overinterpreted . There is a significant fluctuation in the initiation of the action potential after light onset , ranging from 3 to 9ms , and in some cases an action potential fails altogether . The 15ms time point probably represents events that occurred between 6 and 12ms after the action potential . Specifying the exact temporal delay after an action potential is not appropriate— for any particular synapse we don’t know precisely when the action potential occurred . Forthisreasonweassignourtemporalvaluestothearbitrarystartpoint oflightonsetratherthantieittoabiologicaleventsuchasactionpotentialinitiation . After the freezing , the samples were transferred into cryovials containing 1 % glutaraldehyde , 1 % osmium tetroxide , 1 % waterandanhydrous acetoneandpro - cessed in an automated freeze - substitution device ( AFS2 , Leica ) with the follow - ingprogram : 2 – 5hat 2 90 u C , 5 u Ch 2 1 to 2 20 u C , 12hat20 u C , and10 u Ch 2 1 to 20 u C . Cells were stained en bloc with 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate for 1h , embedded in epon , and cured for 48h in a 60 u C oven . The samples were blinded before imag - ing and analysis . Serial 40nm sections were collected on Formvar - coated ( 0 . 5 % ) single - slotgrids , and200synapticprofileswereimagedusinga Zeiss902electron microscope equipped with MegaviewIII camera . Based on therelease probability inmousehippocampalsynapsesandthepreliminarydatacollectedusingacalcium - permeant variant of channelrhodopsin - 2 ( CaTCH ) , exocytosis and endocytosis wouldbecapturedin , 30 % ofsynapticprofiles . Therefore , bycollecting200pro - files , we expected to observe at least 60 structures—sufficient to run statistical analysis . To assess ice crystal damage in the sample , we analysed the morphology ofthemitochondriaandsynapsesineachsample ( ExtendedDataFig . 9 ) . Weonly collectedimagesfromtissueswithnoobviousicecrystaldamage . Synapticprofiles were defined as boutons containing synaptic vesicles attached to a postsynaptic cell with a visible postsynaptic density .

The images were scored blind using an analysis program developed for ImageJ and Matlab ( S . W . , M . W . D . and E . M . J . , unpublished ) . The active zones were defined as the portion of presynaptic membrane directly juxtaposed to the post - synapticdensity . Wedefineddockedvesiclesasthosecontactingtheplasmamem - brane and tethered vesicles as those with a visible tether and within 30nm of the plasma membrane . Vesicles that lack tethers but are within 30nm are defined as , 30nm . Tetherswerevisiblefor , 95 % ofthevesicleswithin30nmofplasmamem - brane . Thediameterofvesicles wasmeasuredfromtheouterleafletofmembrane . Collapsing vesicles decay with a time constant of 32ms , but this value must be corrected because our data include a declining distribution of action potentials after the light stimulation ( t 5 8ms ) . This value was calculated using the follow - ing formula : We calculated the time constant for synaptic vesicle collapse . The presence of omega figures in our electron micrographs relies on the timing of action poten - tials after light stimulation and the speed of collapse of the synaptic vesicle . The presence of collapsing omega figures is then determined by the convolution of these two time constants : e { t = t 1 | e { t = t 2 ~ ½ 1 = ( t 1 { t 2 ) (cid:2) | ( e { t = t 1 { e { t = t 2 ) in which t 5 time ( ms ) , t 1 5 8ms , time constant for action potential decay was determinedfromthedistributionofactionpotentials , t 2 5 20 . 3ms , timeconstant for vesicle collapse was determined as the best fit to the convolution . For ferritin application , cells were immersed in solution containing ferritin ( 0 . 25mgml 2 1 ) with a reduced concentration of calcium ( 1mM ) for 5min to reduce ferritin uptake by spontaneousactivity during incubation . Cells were then transferred into solution containing 4mM calcium and 1mM magnesium and frozen 100ms after light stimulation . To improve the contrast of ferritin , speci - mens were not stained with uranyl acetate . In unstimulated cultures , 18 % of the profiles exhibited some internalization of ferritin , of those profiles only 1 vesicle from the , 56 total vesicles contained ferritin . For latrunculin - A and dynasore experiments , a solution containing 10 m M latrunculin - A or 80 m M dynasore or 0 . 1 % DMSO was applied to cells 30s before freezing . Asinglelightpulsewasapplied100msbeforethefreezeofthelatrunculin - A treatedcells andboth100ms and 1s beforethefreeze of dynasore - treated cells . Following 30s incubation with 80 m M dynasore , there was no significant increase inthetotalnumberofendocyticstructuresfollowingthedynasoretreatment . How - ever , most of the large vesicles became trapped on the membrane . The necks were onlyvisiblein10 / 57largevesicles , probablyduetothethicknessofsections ( 40nm ) . All the solutions used in these experiments contain 4mM calcium and 30 m M bicuculline to increase the release probability and 3 m M NBQX to minimize the recurrent network activity .

Sectionswerestabilizedunderelectronbeam ( 200kV ) for30minbeforeimage acquisition . Tiltseriesfrom 1 65 u to 2 65 u werecollectedfrom43synapseschosen at random using Xplore3D software . Tomograms were generated using IMOD 53 . Membranes were traced from every 10 virtual section in Amira or TrakEM2 54 using a Wacom pen tablet . The gaps were interpolated to prevent hand - tracing errors . The postsynaptic density was segmented using a Lasso tool . Membrane calculations . To calculate the amount of membrane added to the surfacebyexocytosis , wedeterminedthesurfaceareaofdockedvesiclesthatfused after stimulation . The average number of docked vesicles was reduced from 1 . 7 ( 0ms ) to1 . 0 ( 15ms ) vesicleperprofile , thus0 . 7vesiclesfusedineachprofile , assu - ming that novesiclesbecomedockedinthe first 15ms . The diameterofa synaptic vesicle is 41 . 1nm , and the surface area is , 5 , 300nm 2 . Therefore , in each 40 - nm section , 3 , 700nm 2 is added to the surface area of the synaptic plasma membrane . Tocalculatetheamountofmembraneretrieved , wedeterminedthesurfacearea of endocytic structures observed at 100ms after stimulation , assuming that all the pitsprogressto82nmvesicles . Thenumberofendocyticstructuresincreasedfrom 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 , and thus the net increase was 0 . 3 endocytic structures per profile . How - ever , the diameter of the large endocytic structures was 82nm—twice as large as that of synaptic vesicles , and thus the chance of capturing such structures in a 40 - nm section is twice as high . To estimate the amount of membrane recovered in a single40 - nmsection , thenumber ofendocytic structureswasdivided by2 . There - fore , for each synaptic profile , 0 . 15 large endocytic structures would be expected . Becausethesurfaceareaofan82nmlargevesiclewas21 , 000nm 2 , thetotalamount of membrane retrieved from each profile is 3 , 150nm 2 or 0 . 6 vesicle equivalent of membrane—roughly equal to the surface area added during exocytosis . 50 .
