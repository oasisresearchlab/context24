We exploit key diﬀerences across funding streams within the academic life sciences to estimate the impact of incentives on the rate and direction of scientiﬁc exploration . Speciﬁcally , we study the careers of investigators of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( HHMI ) , which tolerates early failure , rewards long - term success , and gives its appointees great freedom to experiment ; and grantees from the National Institute of Health , which are subject to short review cycles , pre - deﬁned deliverables , and renewal policies unforgiv - ing of failure . Using a combination of propensity - score weighting and diﬀerence - in - diﬀerences estimation strategies , we ﬁnd that HHMI investigators produce high - impact articles at a much higher rate than a control group of similarly - accomplished NIH - funded scientists . Moreover , the direction of their research changes in ways that suggest the program induces them to explore novel lines of inquiry .

The usual disclaimer applies . In 1980 , a scientist from the University of Utah , Mario Capecchi , applied for a grant at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . The application contained three projects . The NIH peer - reviewers liked the ﬁrst two projects , which were building on Capecchi’s past research eﬀorts , but they were unanimously negative in their appraisal of the third project , in which he proposed to develop gene targeting in mammalian cells . They deemed the probability that the newly introduced DNA would ever ﬁnd its matching sequence within the host genome vanishingly small , and the experiments not worthy of pursuit . The NIH funded the grant despite this misgiving , but strongly recommended that Capecchi drop the third project . In his retelling of the story , the scientist writes that despite this unambiguous advice , he chose to put almost all his eﬀorts into the third project : “It was a big gamble . Had I failed to obtain strong supporting data within the designated time frame , our NIH funding would have come to an abrupt end and we would not be talking about gene targeting today” ( Capecchi 2008 ) . Fortunately , within four years , Capecchi and his team obtained strong evidence for the feasibility of gene targeting in mammalian cells , and in 1984 the grant was renewed enthusiastically . Dispelling any doubt that he had misinterpreted the feedback from reviewers in 1980 , the critique for the 1984 competitive renewal started , “We are glad that you didn’t follow our advice . ” The story does not stop there . In September 2007 , Capecchi shared the Nobel prize for developing the techniques to make knockout mice with Oliver Smithies and Martin Evans . Such mice have allowed scientists to learn the roles of thousands of mammalian genes and provided laboratory models of human aﬄictions in which to test potential therapies . Across all of the social sciences , researchers often model the creative process as the cu - mulative , interactive recombination of existing bits of knowledge in novel ways ( Weitzman 1998 ; Burt 2004 ; Simonton 2004 ) . But the combinatoric metaphor does not speak directly to the important trade - oﬀ illustrated by the anecdote above . Some discoveries are incremental in nature , and reﬂect the ﬁne - tuning of previously available technologies , or the exploitation of established scientiﬁc trajectories . Others are more radical and require the exploration of new , untested approaches . Both forms of innovation are valuable , but we still have a poor understanding of what drives radical innovation . One view is that radical innovation 1 happens by accident . From Archimedes’ eureka moment to Newton’s otherworldly contem - plation interrupted by the fall of an apple , luck ( and sometimes talent ) play an essential role in lay theories of breakthrough innovation . Of course , if luck and talent exhaust the list of ingredients necessary to produce breakthroughs , then there is little for economists to contribute . In the anecdote reported above , the scientist was undeterred by his peers’ advice to “play it safe , ” and eventually saw his bold ideas prevail . If incentives play an important role in the production of novel ideas , this heroic story might be atypical . In this article , we provide empirical evidence that nuanced features of incentive schemes embodied in the design of research contracts exert a profound inﬂuence on the subsequent development of breakthrough ideas . The challenge is to ﬁnd a setting in which ( 1 ) radical innovation is a key concern ; ( 2 ) agents are at risk of receiving diﬀerent incentive schemes ; and ( 3 ) it is possible to measure innovative output and to distinguish between incremental and radical ideas . We argue that the academic life sciences in the United States provides an excellent testing ground . Speciﬁcally , we study the careers of researchers who can be funded through two very distinct mechanisms : investigator - initiated R01 grants from the NIH , or support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( HHMI ) through its investigator program . HHMI , a non - proﬁt medical research organization , plays a powerful role in advancing biomedical research and science education in the United States . The Institute commits almost $ 700 million a year — a larger amount than the NSF biological sciences program , for example . HHMI’s stated goal is to “push the boundaries of knowledge” in some of the most important areas of biological research . To do so , the HHMI program has adopted practices that according to Manso ( 2010 ) should provide strong incentives for breakthrough scientiﬁc discoveries : the award cycles are long ( ﬁve years , and typically renewed at least once ) ; the review process provides detailed , high - quality feedback to the researcher ; and the program selects “people , not projects , ” which allows ( and in fact encourages ) the quick reallocation of resources to 2 new approaches when the initial ones are not fruitful . 1 This stands in sharp contrast with the incentives faced by life scientists funded by the NIH . The typical R01 grant cycle lasts only three years , and renewal is not very forgiving of failure . Feedback on performance is limited in its depth . Importantly , the NIH funds projects with clearly deﬁned deliverables , not individual scientists , which could increase the costs of experimentation . The contrast between the HHMI and NIH grant mechanisms naturally leads to the ques - tion of whether HHMI - style incentives result in a higher rate of production of particularly valuable ideas . Three signiﬁcant hurdles must be overcome to answer this question . First , we need to identify a group of NIH - funded scientists that are appropriate controls for the researchers selected into the HHMI program . Given the high degree of accomplish - ment exhibited by HHMI investigators at the time of their appointment , a random sample of scientists of the same age , working in the same ﬁelds , would not be appropriate . In the absence of a plausible source of exogenous variation for HHMI appointment , we estimate the treatment eﬀect of the program by contrasting HHMI - funded scientists’ output with that of a group of NIH - funded scientists who focus their research on the same subﬁelds of the life sciences as HHMI investigators , and received prestigious early career prizes . Furthermore , using an in - depth understanding of the HHMI appointment process , we cull from this control group scientists who look similar to the HHMI investigators on the observable factors that we know to be relevant for selection into the HHMI program . Second , we must be able to distinguish particularly creative contributions from incremen - tal advances . While we investigate the eﬀect of the program on the raw number of original research articles published , the bulk of our analysis focuses on the number of publications that fall into diﬀerent quantiles of the vintage - speciﬁc , article - level distribution of citations ( see Figure 1 ) : top quartile , top ﬁve percentiles , and top percentile . We also use these scientists’ own citation impact in the pre - appointment period to ask whether they often out - perform their most heavily - cited article , and conversely , whether they often publish articles who garner less citations than their least cited article . Another prong in our attempt to mea - 1 Though not part of Manso’s ( 2010 ) initial analysis , we extend his model in the Appendix to show that providing the researcher greater latitude in her search activities encourages exploration . 3 sure creativity is to measure explorative behavior directly . Speciﬁcally , we examine whether the research agenda of HHMI investigators changes after their appointment ; we measure the novelty ( both relative to the universe of published research and to the scientists themselves ) of the keywords tagging their publications ; and we also assess whether the impact of their research broadens , as inferred by the range of journals that cite it . Third , we need to ascertain whether it is the incentive features of the program that explain its eﬀects , or some alternative mechanism , such as increased resources , ascription dynamics ( whereby HHMI investigators get cited more due to their enhanced status ) , peer eﬀects , or the sorting of talented trainees into HHMI - supported labs . We tackle these issues ( to the extent possible ) in the discussion . Our results provide support for the hypothesis that appropriately designed incentives stimulate exploration . In particular , we ﬁnd that the eﬀect of selection into the HHMI program increases as we examine higher quantiles of the distribution of citations . Relative to Early Career Prize Winners ( ECPWs ) , our preferred econometric estimates imply that the program increases overall publication output by 39 % ; the magnitude jumps to 96 % when focusing on the number of publications in the top percentile of the citation distribution . Success is also more frequent among HHMI investigators when assessed with respect to scientists’ own citation impact prior to appointment , rather than relative to a universal citation benchmark . Symmetrically , we also uncover robust evidence that HHMI - supported scientists “ﬂop” more often than ECPWs : they publish 35 % more articles that fail to clear the ( vintage - adjusted ) citation bar of their least well cited pre - appointment work . This provides suggestive evidence that HHMI investigators are not simply rising stars annointed by the program . Rather , they appear to place more risky scientiﬁc bets after their appointment , as theory would suggest . We bolster the case for the exploration hypothesis by focusing on various attributes of these scientists’ research agenda . We show that the work of HHMI investigators is character - ized by more novel keywords than controls . These keywords are also more likely to change 4 after their HHMI appointment . Moreover , their research is cited by a more diverse set of journals , both relative to controls and to the pre - appointment period . The rest of the article proceeds as follows . In the next section , we present the theoret - ical motivation for our hypothesis . Section 2 describes the construction of the sample and presents descriptive statistics . Section 3 lays out our econometric methodology . Section 4 reports and discusses the results of the analysis . Section 5 concludes . 1 Theoretical Background The bulk of the literature on incentives for innovation has focused on the problems inherent to the measurement and contractability of output that plagues most innovative activities . For example , Holmstr¨om ( 1989 ) observes that most innovation projects are risky , unpredictable , long - term , labor - intensive , and idiosyncratic . In such settings , performance measures are likely to be extremely noisy , and contracting particularly challenging . This leads him to see virtue in the adoption of low - powered incentives when creativity is what is required of the agent , for salary is less likely to distort the agent’s attention away from the less - easily measurable tasks that compete for her attention . This view stands in sharp contrast with the standard prescription to adopt piece rates whenever agent’s individual contributions are easy to measure , such as in the case of the windshield installers studied by Lazear ( 2000 ) . A substantial body of experimental and ﬁeld research in psychology reaches a similar conclusion , but for diﬀerent reasons : the worry is that pay - for - performance might encourage the repetition of what has worked in the past , at the expense of the exploration of untested approaches ( Amabile 1996 ) . In a recent article , Manso ( 2010 ) explicitly models the innovation process as the result of learning through experimentation . In this setting , the trade - oﬀ between the exploitation of well - known approaches and the exploration of new untested approaches ﬁrst emphasized by March ( 1991 ) arises naturally . The main insight of his contribution is that the optimal incentive scheme to motivate exploration exhibits substantial tolerance for early failure and rewards for long - term success . Tolerance for early failure allows the agent to explore in the 5 early stages of the contractual relationship without incurring the usual negative consequences of lower pay or termination . At the same time , reward for long - term success prevents the agent from shirking early on and induces the agent to explore new ideas that will allow him to perform well in the long - run . The principal can more eﬀectively motivate exploration if he can commit not to terminate an agent after poor short - term performance , even if it is ex - post eﬃcient for the principal to do so . Another important ingredient of Manso’s model is timely feedback on performance . Providing information to the agent about how well he is doing allows the agent to explore more eﬃciently , reducing the costs of experimentation . An agent who does not get feedback on performance may waste more time on unfruitful ideas . Empirical evidence on the eﬀects of long - term incentives is scant . Most relevant to the ﬁndings presented below is Lerner and Wulf’s ( 2007 ) study of corporate R & D lab heads . They show that higher levels of deferred compensation are associated with the production of more heavily cited patents , while short - term incentives bear no relationship to ﬁrm innovative performance . In a similar vein , Tian and Wang ( 2010 ) show that start - up ﬁrms backed by more failure - tolerant venture capitalists are more innovative ex - post . The present article presents the ﬁrst systematic attempt to isolate , in a ﬁeld setting , the eﬀect of the bundle of incentive practices identiﬁed by Manso ( 2010 ) on exploration and creativity at the individual level ( see Ederer and Manso [ 2010 ] for experimental evidence with a similar ﬂavor ) . We believe that the academic life sciences in the United States provide an appropriate setting , ﬁrst and foremost because it provides naturally - occurring variation in incentives that closely matches the contrast between pay - for - performance and exploration - type schemes emphasized by Manso ( 2010 ) . Most academic life scientists must rely on grants from the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , the largest public funder of biomedical research in the United States . With an annual budget of $ 28 . 4 billion in 2007 , support from the NIH dwarfs that available from other public or private funders , including the National Science Foundation ( $ 6 billion in 2007 ) or the American Cancer Society ( $ 147 million in 2007 ) . The most common type of NIH grant for investigator - initiated projects is the R01 grant . In 2007 , their average amount was $ 225 , 000 in annual direct costs , and the awards last for a typical three to ﬁve years before coming 6 up for renewal ( see Figure 2 ) . The NIH “study sections , ” or peer - review panels in charge of allocating awards , are notoriously risk - averse and often insist on a great deal of preliminary evidence before deciding to fund a project . This often leads researchers to resubmit their applications several times and to multiply the number of applications , taking time away from productive research activities . It is an often - heard complaint among academic biomedical researchers that study sections’ prickliness encourages them to pursue relatively safe avenues that build directly on previous results , at the expense of truly exploratory research ( Kaplan 2005 ; Kolata 2009 ; McKnight 2009 ) . An alternative funding mechanism is provided by the investigator program of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ( HHMI ) . This program “urges its researchers to take risks , to ex - plore unproven avenues , to embrace the unknown – even if it means uncertainty or the chance of failure . ” 2 New appointments are based on nominations from research institutions ; once selected , researchers continue to be based at their institutions , typically leading a research group of 10 to 25 students , postdoctoral associates and technicians . In its stated policies , HHMI departs in striking fashion from NIH’s funding practices , in ways that should bring incentives in line with the type of schemes suggested by Manso ( 2010 ) . HHMI Investigators are initially appointed for 5 years , 3 and in the case of termination , there is a two - year phase - down period during which the researcher continues to be funded , allowing her to search for other sources of funding without having to close down her lab . Moreover , HHMI investigators appear to share the perception that their ﬁrst appoint - ment review is rather lax , with reviewers more interested in making sure that they have taken on new projects with uncertain payoﬀs , rather than insisting on achievements . Below , we validate this perception by showing that the second review is much more sensitive to performance than the ﬁrst . The review process is also streamlined , lasting a mere six weeks . Investigators are asked to submit a packet containing their ﬁve most notable articles in the past ﬁve years , along with a short research proposal for the next ﬁve years . In contrast , NIH 2 See http : / / www . hhmi . org / research / investigators / 3 Appointment lengths have varied over the history of the program , more detailed information will be provided in the data section . 7 grants take at a minimum three months to be reviewed , and success typically depends upon a rather exhaustive list of accomplishments by the primary research team members . Since HHMI researchers publish 29 articles on average in the ﬁve years that follow their initial appointment ( the median is 25 ) , constraining their renewal packet to contain only ﬁve articles ensures that only what they see as their most meaningful achievements matters for the renewal decision . The review process culminates in an oral defense in front of an elite panel especially convened for the occasion . The reviewers must not be HHMI researchers , and are of very high caliber ( e . g . , members of the National Academies ) . The richness of the feedback is yet another point of departure between HHMI and NIH practices . Besides the intensity and quality of the advice generated by the review process , HHMI - funded scientists participate in annual science meetings during which they can interact with other HHMI investigators . This gives them access to a deep level of critique , encouragement , ideas , and potential collaborations . While NIH - funded researchers receive a critique of their grant applications , these vary widely in quality and depth . Furthermore , the federal agency does not provide any meaningful feedback between review cycles . Finally , an important distinction between the two sources of funding is the unit of selec - tion . The NIH funds speciﬁc projects . Applicants need to map out experiments far into the future , and have limited ﬂexibility to change course between funding cycles . Together with study sections’ insistence on preliminary results , this has led many NIH grantees to submit research that is already quite developed . In contrast , HHMI insists on funding “people , not projects . ” This allows HHMI researchers to quickly reallocate eﬀort and resources away from avenues that do not bear fruit . The economics literature ( e . g . , Aghion , Dewatripont , and Stein 2008 ) views unfettered control over one’s research agenda as the key distinguishing feature of innovative activities performed in academia ( relative to the private sector ) . Vari - ation in the unit of selection reminds us that the degree of eﬀective control experienced by academic researchers often depends on the arcane details of funding mechanisms . Though not part of Manso’s ( 2010 ) initial analysis , we extend his model in the Appendix to show that providing the researcher greater latitude in her search activities encourages exploration . Table 1 summarizes the main diﬀerences between the two sources of funding . 8 2 Data and Sample Characteristics This section provides a detailed description of the process through which the data used in the econometric analysis were assembled . In order , we describe ( 1 ) the Howard Hughes Medical Investigator sample ; ( 2 ) the set of control investigators against which the HHMI scientists will be compared ; and ( 3 ) our metrics of scientiﬁc creativity . We also present relevant descriptive statistics . HHMI Sample We begin with a basic description of the criteria necessary for nomination and appointment as an HHMI investigator . To be eligible , a scientist must be tenured or on the tenure - track at a major research university , academic medical center , or research institute . The subﬁelds of the life sciences of interest to HHMI investigators are quite broad , but have tended to concentrate on cell and molecular biology , neurobiology , immunology , and biochemistry . Career - stage considerations have varied over time although HHMI typically has not appointed scientists until they have had enough independent experience so that their work can be distinguished from that of their postdoctoral or graduate school adviser . Upon receipt of nominations from participating institutions , HHMI empanels a jury that reviews these nominations in two sequential steps . In a ﬁrst step , the number of nominees is whittled down to a manageable number , mostly based on observable characteristics . For example , NIH - funded investigators have an advantage because the panel of judges interprets receipt of federal grants as a signal of management ability . The jury also looks for evidence that the nominee has stepped out of the shadow cast by his / her mentors : an independent research agenda , and a “big hit , ” i . e . , a high - impact publication in which the mentor’s name does not appear on the coauthorship list . In a second step , each remaining nominee’s cre - dentials and future plans are given an in - depth qualitative look . 4 Finally , until recently , 4 While an input into this process is a letter grade , the review does not provide a continuous score that could be used in a regression discontinuity - type framework . Moreover , the cutoﬀ that separates successful from unsuccessful nominees is endogenous in the sense that it depends on the overall quality of the applicant pool . 9 appointment contracts varied in their initial length . Assistant Investigators ( Assistant Pro - fessors in their home institution ) were appointed for three years ; Associate Investigators , for ﬁve years ; and Investigators , for seven years . 5 Our analysis focuses on HHMI investigators appointed in 1993 , 1994 , and 1995 . We exclude the three researchers that withdrew from the program voluntarily , leaving us with a sample of 73 scientists . 6 Control Sample : Early Career Prize Winners In the absence of information on the runners - up of the HHMI competitions , we must rely on observable characteristics to create viable control groups . The main challenge is that HHMI investigators are extremely accomplished at the time of their appointment . Controls should not only be well - matched with HHMI investigators in terms of ﬁelds , age , gender , and host institutions ; their accomplishments should also be comparable at baseline . Our control group is drawn from early career prize winners in the life sciences . The Pew , Searle , Beckman , Packard , and Rita Allen Scholarships are early - career prizes that target scientists in the same life science subﬁelds and similar research institutions as HHMI . Every year , these charitable trusts provide seed funding to around 60 life scientists in the ﬁrst two years of their independent careers . These scholarships are among the most prestigious accolades that young researchers can receive as they are building a laboratory , but they diﬀer from HHMI investigatorships in one essential respect : they are structured as one - time grants ( e . g . , $ 60 , 000 a year over 4 years for the Pew Scholarship ; $ 80 , 000 a year for 3 years for the Searle Scholarship , etc . ) . These amounts are relatively small , roughly corresponding to 35 % of a typical NIH R01 grant . As a result , these scholars must still attract 5 In our sample , these categories respectively account 15 % , 70 % , and 15 % of the total number of scientists in the treatment group . Of course , such variation raises the specter that appointment length might be endogenous . In fact , the length of the initial term is purely a function of the scientist’s academic rank in his / her home institution . 6 One accepted a top administrative position in his / her university ( HHMI rules prevent investigators to hold major administrative posts ) , one moved to an institution that has no relationship with HHMI . Yet another wished to move to a diﬀerent institution during his / her ﬁrst appointment . To prevent the eruption of bidding wars over HHMI investigators , the Institute forces such investigators to resign their appointment . 10 grants from other funding sources ( especially NIH ) if they intend to further their independent research career . After a screen to eliminate investigators whose age place them outside the age range of the treatment group , and a second screen to exclude researchers working in idiosyncratic ﬁelds , we are left with 393 scientists awarded one of these scholarships . Before presenting descriptive statistics , it is useful to discuss broad features of the control group that will inﬂuence the interpretation of the treatment eﬀect . The process that results in the selection of HHMIs and controls is very similar . In both cases , an elite jury of senior scientists is given the mission to identify individuals with an impressive track record as well as exceptional promise ; in particular , they are not asked to evaluate the merits of an individual project . The main diﬀerence between these programs is that ECPWs are selected at the very start of their independent career , when it is diﬃcult to distinguish their output from that of their postdoctoral mentor . In contrast , the modal HHMI investigator stands at the cusp of the tenure decision when s / he is appointed . As a result , there is more variability in the expected performance of ECPW scholars than is the case among HHMI investigators , but as we will show , it is possible to cull from this group a subsample of scientists whose characteristics match well those of HHMI scientists at baseline . Measuring Scientiﬁc Creativity Creativity is a loaded term . The wikipedia entry informs us that more than 60 diﬀerent deﬁnitions can be found in the psychological literature , none of which is particularly au - thoritative . Furthermore , there exists no agreed - upon measurement metrics or techniques to measure creative outputs . The perspective adopted in this article is very pragmatic , and guided by the constraints put on us by the availability of data . Amabile ( 1996 ) suggests that while innovation “begins with creative ideas . . . creativity by individuals and teams is a starting point for innovation ; the ﬁrst is a necessary but not suﬃcient condition for the second . ” While we certainly agree with this view at a conceptual level , the measurement of scientiﬁc productivity — an already well - established discipline — makes it hard to recognize this nuance . A crucial development in 11 the bibliometric literature has been the use of citation information to adjust raw publication counts for quality . Such an approach is not entirely satisfying here , as both “humdrum” and “breakthrough” research generate publications and citations . Moreover , some types of publications , like review articles , tend to generate a number of citations not commensurate with their degree of originality . It has long been noted that the distributions of publications and citations at the individual level is extremely skewed , and typically follows a power law ( Lotka 1926 ) . The distribution of citations at the article level exhibits even more skewness . In this article , we make use of the wide variation in impact across the publications of a given scientist to compute measures of creative output . Speciﬁcally , we sum the number of distinct contributions that fall into the higher quantiles ( top quartile , top ﬁve percentiles , or top percentile ) of the article - level distribution of citations , for an individual scientist in a given time period . One practical hurdle is truncation : older articles have had more time to be cited , and hence are more likely to reach the tail of the citation distribution . To overcome this issue , we compute a diﬀerent empirical cumulative distribution function in each year . 7 For example , in the life sciences broadly deﬁned , an article published in 1980 would require at least 98 citations to fall into the top ﬁve percentiles of the distribution ; an article published in 1990 , 94 citations ; and an article published in 2000 , only 57 citations ( this is illustrated in Figure 1 ) . With these empirical distributions in hand , it becomes meaningful to count the number of articles that fall , for example , in the top percentile over a scientist’s career . Counting the number of contributions that fall “in the tail” is predicated on the idea that exploration is more likely to result in high - impact publications , relative to exploitation . 8 We also assess impact relative to each scientist’s own pre - appointment citation performance . Because there is not enough data to estimate individual , vintage - speciﬁc citation distributions , we use the entire corpus of work published up until the year of appointment ( 1993 , 1994 , or 1995 ) to 7 We thank Stefan Wuchty and Ben Jones from Northwestern University for performing these computa - tions . 8 We exclude review articles , editorials , and letters from the set when computing these measures . We also eliminate articles with more than 20 authors . 12 compute the citation quantile corresponding to each scientist’s most heavily - cited article . We then count the number of times a scientist exceeds this level after appointment . We rely on two additional metrics of scientiﬁc excellence . We tabulate elections to the National Academy of Sciences . We also measure the number of students and fellows trained in a scientist’s lab that go on to win a Pew , Searle , Beckman , Packard , or Rita Allen scholarship . 9 HHMI appointments might also fatten the left - hand tail of the outcome distribution , since pushing the boundaries of one’s ﬁeld is a riskier endeavor than cruising along an already - established scientiﬁc trajectory . To test this prediction , we compute the number of contributions that fall in the bottom quartile of the vintage - speciﬁc , article - level distribution of citations ( about three citations or less ) . 10 We also count the number of times each scien - tist underperforms , relative to the pre - appointment article corresponding to his / her lowest citation quantile . Since HHMI investigators remain eligible for NIH grants , we also examine how funding outcomes change following appointment , relative to ECPW controls . In par - ticular , our data enables us to separate whether funding levels diﬀer because of a change in application behavior , or because HHMIs’ grant applications are scored diﬀerently by NIH’s review panels in the post - appointment regime . Finally , explorative behavior should have implications for the direction of research en - deavors , independently of the success or failure of the associated projects . To investigate this issue , we construct a battery of measures designed to capture potential changes in the scientists’ research trajectories . Most of these measures use MeSH keywords as an essential input . 11 First , we calculate the average age of MeSH keywords for the published research of every scientist in the sample , separately for each year of their independent career . A keyword is said to be born the ﬁrst year it appears in any article indexed by PubMed . This measure 9 We do not emphasize the results pertaining to these outcomes , because they seem particularly subject to alternative interpretations : NAS members are elected , and the large contingent of HHMI investigators among the incumbent membership might skew the results in favor of the treated scientists ; similarly , it is plausible that better students match with HHMI PIs after their appointment . 10 Too few investigators exit science altogether to make exit a useful indicator of failure . 11 MeSH is the National Library of Medicine’s controlled vocabulary thesaurus ; it consists of sets of terms naming descriptors in a hierarchical structure that permits searching at various levels of speciﬁcity . There are 24 , 767 descriptors in the 2008 MeSH . 13 captures the extent to which a scientist’s research is novel relative to the world’s research frontier . Equally important is to document the extent to which scientists place new scien - tiﬁc bets in the post - appointment period ( 1995 - 2006 ) relative to the pre appointment - period ( 1986 - 1994 ) . 12 We do so by ( a ) computing the degree of overlap in MeSH keywords cor - responding to articles published in both periods ; computing the Herﬁndahl index of MeSH keywords in both periods ( a proxy for variety in topic choice ) ; and ( c ) computing one minus the Herﬁndahl index of citing journal diversity in both periods ( a measure of impact breadth , rather than impact depth as with the citation quantiles ) . If HHMI investigators are induced to explore novel approaches following their appointment , we would expect this behavior to be reﬂected in these measures . Descriptive Statistics For each scientist , we gathered employment and basic demographic data from CVs , some - times complemented by Who’s Who proﬁles or faculty web pages . We record the following information : degrees ( MD , PhD , or MD / PhD ) ; year of graduation ; mentors during graduate school or post - doctoral fellowship ; gender ; and department ( s ) . We obtain publication and citation data from PubMed and Thomson Scientiﬁc’s Web of Science , respectively . Funding information stems from NIH’s Compound Applicant Grant File ( CGAF ) , and is available for the entire length of these scientists’ career . In contrast , grant applications and their associated priority scores ( the “grades” awarded to applications by NIH review panels ) are available solely for years 2003 through 2008 . Finally , we categorize the type of laboratory run by each scientist into four broad types : macromolecular labs , cellular labs , organismal labs , and translational labs . For the ﬁrst three types , the taxonomy is based on the level of analysis at which most of the research is performed in the lab . Some scientists work mostly at the molecular level ( i . e . , in test tubes ) . This type of research does not require living cells , and includes ﬁelds such as molec - ular biology , biochemistry , and structural biology . Others do most of their research at the 12 For investigators appointed in 1993 ( resp . 1995 ) , the “after” period begins in 1994 ( resp . 1996 ) . 14 cellular level ( i . e . , in petri dishes ) , and ask questions that require living cells . Prominent subﬁelds include subcellular traﬃcking , cell morphology , cell motility , and some aspects of cell signaling . Yet others work with model organisms ( mice , ﬂies , monkeys , worms , etc . ) , asking questions that require , if not a whole organism , at least the interaction of multiple cells . The translational label is given to labs run by physician - scientists whose research have both a laboratory and a clinical component . HHMI and control samples at baseline . Table 2 presents baseline descriptive statistics . Approximately 37 % of the HHMI sample is female , versus 20 % of the ECPW sample . They are of the same career age on average , but better funded than ECPW scholars at baseline ( $ 1 . 45 million vs . $ 1 . 10 million on average ) . In terms of raw publication output , the pattern is very similar , with HHMI investigators leading ECPW scholars . The breadth of impact and diversity of topics studied by these scientists appears similar for both groups of scientists . ECPWs and HHMIs appear to be drawn from a similar set of academic employers in a dimension relevant for HHMI appointment : the number of slots allocated to their institution at the nomination stage . Of course , these averages tell only part of the story . Figure 3A plots the distribution of baseline publications in the Top 5 % of the citation distribution . Note that we are only including here publications for which the scientist is the senior author , i . e . , where s / he appears in last position on the authorship list . The distribution for ECPW scholars appears signiﬁcantly more skewed than that for HHMI investigators . Similarly , Figure 3B plots the distribution of NIH funding at baseline for treatment and control scientists ; the shapes of these distributions are very similar . In summary , characteristics that determine selection into the HHMI program are not especially well - balanced at baseline between treatment and control scientists . However , the region of common support is wide , indicating that it should be possible to create “synthetic” control scientists that will be good matches for HHMI investigators on these important dimensions . 15 Career achievement . While the diﬀerences between treatment and control samples are relatively modest at baseline , their magnitude increases when we examine achievements over the entire career . In Table 3 we see that HHMI scientists publish many more articles than ECPW scientists , with this output of higher quality , regardless of the quantile threshold one chooses to focus on . Of course , these accomplishments should be viewed in light of HHMIs’ funding advantage : while they have garnered less resources from NIH by the end of the sample period than ECPW scholars , they also beneﬁt from HHMI’s relatively lavish research budgets . In fact , HHMI scientists apply less for R01 grants than controls who have no alternative sources of funding : 3 . 2 vs . 5 . 1 applications on average between 2003 and 2008 . On the other hand , conditional on applying , these same applications are judged more harshly by NIH study sections , since they are associated with higher priority scores . 13 Among our “direct” measures of explorative behavior , only the average level of normalized keyword overlap appears to be lower for HHMIs , compared with ECPW controls in these univariate comparisons . When we focus on discrete career accolades , we observe an even greater contrast between HHMI and control scientists . Approximately a third of the HHMI investigators are elected members of the National Academy of Sciences , versus 4 . 1 % for the control sample . Our 73 HHMI investigators collectively train 83 future early career prize winners ( an average of 1 . 13 per scientist ) , whereas the control investigators are mentors to 90 such “young superstars” ( an average of 0 . 23 per scientist ) . 3 Econometric Considerations In order to estimate the treatment eﬀect of the HHMI investigator program , we must con - front a basic identiﬁcation problem : appointments are driven by expectations about the creative potential of scientists , and selected investigators might have experienced very simi - lar outcomes had they not been appointed . As a result , traditional econometric techniques , which assume that assignment into the program is random , cannot recover causal eﬀects . 13 Priority scores vary between 100 and 500 , with lower scores indicating applications with a higher chance of funding . 16 Propensity - score weighting . As an attempt to overcome this challenge , we estimate the eﬀects of the program using inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation ( Robins and Rotnitzky 1995 ; Hirano and Imbens 2001 ; Busso , DiNardo , and McCrary 2008 ) . Suppose we have a random sample of size N . For each individual i in this sample , let T REAT i indicate whether s / he received treatment . Using the counterfactual outcome notation ( e . g . , Rubin 1974 ) , let y 1 i be the value of the outcome y that would have been observed had i received treatment , and y 0 i the value of the outcome had i been assigned to the control arm of the experiment . In addition , we will assume that we observe a vector of covariates denoted by X = ( W , Z ) . The variables included in W are assumed to be strictly exogenous ; in contrast , the vector Z includes pre - treatment variables such as lagged outcomes . For each individual i , the treatment eﬀect is y 1 i − y 0 i . For the population as a whole , we are interested in two distinct estimands , the Average Treatment Eﬀect ( ATE ) and the Average Treatment Eﬀect on the Treated ( ATT ) . Formally : β ATE = E [ y 1 i − y 0 i ] β ATT = E [ y 1 i − y 0 i | T REAT i = 1 ] While ATE elucidates what would be the average eﬀect of treatment for an individual picked at random from the population , ATT measures the average eﬀect for the subpopulation that is likely to receive treatment . The diﬃculty in identifying these coeﬃcients is identical , however : for a given individual , we observe y 1 or y 0 , but never both . Following Rosenbaum and Rubin ( 1983 ) , we make the “selection on observables” or unconfoundedness assumption : T REAT (cid:113) ( y 1 ; y 0 ; Z ) | X where the (cid:113) sign denotes statistical independence . Let the propensity score , the conditional probability of treatment , be denoted by p ( x ) = P rob ( T REAT i = 1 | X i = x ) ; further , we assume that 0 < p ( x ) < 1 . These admittedly strong assumptions enable the identiﬁcation of ATE and ATT ; the two eﬀects can be recovered by a two - step procedure relying on a 17 ﬁrst - step estimate of the propensity score ˆ p ( x ) . In the second step , the outcome equation y i = β 0 + β (cid:48) 1 W i + β 2 T REAT i + ε i ( 1 ) is estimated by weighted least squares or weighted maximum likelihood ( depending on the type of dependent variable ) , where the weights are simple functions of the estimated propen - sity score : w ATEi = T REAT i ˆ p ( x i ) + 1 − T REAT i 1 − ˆ p ( x i ) w ATTi = T REAT i + ( 1 − T REAT i ) · ˆ p ( x i ) 1 − ˆ p ( x i ) In order to develop the intuition for this weighting strategy , we examine the formula corresponding to w ATE a bit more closely . Each factor in the denominator is the probability that an individual received her own observed treatment , conditional on her past history of “prognosis factors” for treatment . Suppose that all relevant variables are observed and included in X . Then , weighting eﬀectively creates a pseudo - population in which X no longer predicts selection into treatment and the causal association between treatment and outcome is the same as in the original population . 14 Assessing unconfoundedness . Propensity - score weighting relies on the assumption that selection into treatment occurs solely on the basis of factors observed by the econometrician . This will appear to many readers as a strong assumption — one that is unlikely to be literally true . Despite the strength of the assumption , we consider it a useful starting point . Past research in the program evaluation literature has shown that techniques that assume selection on observables perform well ( in the sense of replicating an experimental benchmark ) when ( 1 ) researchers use a rich list of covariates to model the probability of treatment ; ( 2 ) units are drawn from similar labor markets , and ( 3 ) outcomes are measured in the same way for both treatment and control groups ( Dehejia and Waba 2002 ; Smith and Todd 2005 ) . Conditions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are trivially satisﬁed here , but one might wonder about condition ( 1 ) , namely the extent to which the analysis accounts for the relevant determinants of HHMI appointment . 14 One might worry about statistical inference , since the weights used as inputs to estimate the outcome equation are themselves estimated . In contrast to two - step selection correction methods , the standard errors obtained in this case are conservative ( Wooldridge , 2002 ) . 18 Through interviews with HHMI senior administrators , we have sought to identify the criteria that increase the odds of appointments , conditional on being nominated . As de - scribed earlier , the Institute appears focused on making sure that its new investigators have stepped out of the shadow cast by their graduate school or postdoctoral mentors . They also want to ensure that these investigators have the leadership and managerial skills required to run a successful laboratory , and interpret receipt of NIH funding as a important signal of possessing these skills . In practice , we capture the “stepping out” criteria by counting the number of last - authored , high - impact contributions the scientist has made since the be - ginning of his / her independent career . 15 We proxy PI leadership skills with an measure of cumulative R01 NIH funding at baseline . Of course , our selection equation also includes important demographic characteristics , such as gender , laboratory type , degree , and career age . Semi - Parametric Diﬀerence in Diﬀerences . An alternative methodology is to rely on within - scientist variation to identify the program’s treatment eﬀect . Scientist ﬁxed eﬀects purge estimates from any inﬂuence of unobserved heterogeneity that is constant over time . However , for diﬀerence - in - diﬀerences ( DD ) estimation to be valid , it must be the case that the average outcome for the treated and control groups would have followed parallel paths over time in the absence of treatment . This assumption is implausible if pretreatment char - acteristics that are thought to be associated with the dynamics of the outcome variable are unbalanced between treatment and control units . Below , we provide strong evidence that se - lection into the program is inﬂuenced by transitory shocks to scientiﬁc opportunities : HHMI scientists have higher output in the years immediately preceding their appointment . In such a case , Abadie ( 2005 ) proposes a semiparametric diﬀerence - in - diﬀerences ( SDD ) estimator that combines the advantages of adjustment for observed heterogeneity with dif - ferencing . The idea is to apply propensity score reweighting not to the levels of outcome y as above , but to the diﬀerences in outcome between the post - and pre - treatment periods . 15 A robust social norm in the life sciences systematically assigns last authorship to the principal investi - gator , ﬁrst authorship to the junior author who was responsible for the actual conduct of the investigation , and apportions the remaining credit to authors in the middle of the authorship list , generally as a decreasing function of the distance from the extremities of the list . 19 Under some additional regularity conditions , the Average Treatment Eﬀect on the Treated ( ATT ) is identiﬁed and can be recovered by weighting y post − y pre using : w SDDi = T REAT i − ˆ p ( x i ) π · ( 1 − ˆ p ( x i ) ) where π denotes the unconditional odds of treatment P rob ( T REAT i = 1 ) . Intuitively , the weights create a pseudo - population of untreated scientists that follow similar dynamics to the treated group in the pre - treatment period . The SDD estimator then subtracts the change in outcomes for treated scientists with the change in outcome for this pseudo - population of con - trol scientists . Inference is performed using a non - parametric pairwise bootstrap procedure with 500 replications . The SDD estimates are still vulnerable to the critique that time - varying sources of un - observed heterogeneity could bias the eﬀects , but they greatly narrow the scope of selection concerns . Because they rely on within - scientist variation , ﬁxed personality diﬀerences that impact the creative potential of individual scientists ( such as conscientiousness [ Charlton 2009 ] or desire for intellectual challenge [ Sauermann and Cohen 2008 ] ) do not jeopardize a causal interpretation of the eﬀect of HHMI appointment . Rather , one might worry that the appointment committee is able to recognize and select for “exploratory tendencies” before they manifest themselves in the researcher’s published work . If this were the case , these la - tent explorers might have branched out in new directions even in the absence of their HHMI appointment . Though we cannot rule out this possibility , we take solace in the fact that ECPW scholars and HHMIs are very well - matched at baseline along the dimensions of topic novelty and citation breadth , dimensions that we argue are good proxies for exploration . Furthermore , ECPW scholars are selected through a very similar process at an earlier career stage ; given that the same individuals , or at least the same type of individuals often serve on these panels , it is unlikely that the HHMI committee is more skilled at identifying those scientists that are “itching to branch out . ” 20 4 Results Our presentation of results is organized in three sets of tables . Table 4 pertains solely to HHMI investigators , and validates empirically some of the purported distinctive features of the program . Table 5 presents evidence on the determinants of HHMI appointment . Finally , Tables 6 , 7 , and 8 present estimates of the program’s eﬀects . HHMI appointments : rhetoric and practice . We begin by validating our claims about the terms of the HHMI investigator award . The unconditional probability of termination at the end of the ﬁrst appointment term is 15 . 5 % , versus 28 . 33 % at the end of the second ap - pointment term ( conditional on being renewed once ) . However , our contention that the ﬁrst review is laxer than the second has implications for the conditional probability of ﬁrst and second reappointment . Speciﬁcally , if the perception of the program’s administrators and in - vestigators is accurate , the probability of second reappointment should be more responsive to achievements during the preceding term than the probability of ﬁrst reappointment . Table 4 provides evidence consistent with this hypothesis . It reports estimates from logit models of reappointment as explained by various indicators of achievement during the preceding term . We ﬁnd a consistent pattern , regardless of the achievement variable on the right - hand side : higher achievement signiﬁcantly increases the likelihood of renewal at the end of the second term , but not at the end of the ﬁrst term . Moreover , the marginal eﬀect for blockbuster articles produced in the previous period is twice as large as the marginal eﬀect for total publication output . This is consistent with the idea that HHMI review panels care more about whether investigators “transform their ﬁelds” than they care about counting lines on their CVs . From these results , we conclude that the HHMI program conforms both in its stated and actual practices with the features that Manso ( 2010 ) predicts should encourage exploration . Determinants of HHMI appointment . We now turn to the observable determinants of selection into the HHMI program ( Table 5 ) . We present the results from logit speciﬁcations that include demographic characteristics as controls , as well as cumulative NIH funding at 21 baseline , and achievements as PI in the pre - appointment period . Among the demographic characteristics , the only consistent pattern is the higher appointment probability of female scientists . Consistent with the qualitative evidence on the selection process , we ﬁnd that the number of “hit articles” at baseline is highly predictive of appointment . In contrast , the level of funding appears to play no role in the odds of selection . Using the most saturated model of selection ( column 5 ) , we ﬁnd that the region of common support excludes 4 HHMI investigators whose superlative record of achievement prior to appointment makes them diﬃcult to compare to any member of the control group . Conversely , 45 early career prize winners have a very low predicted probability of appointment , mostly because they do not produce an impactful article after they set up their lab . In all that follows , we have excluded from the estimation sample these 49 scientists . This ensures the validity of the common support assumption , which is necessary to identify the average treatment eﬀect ( ATE ) or the average treatment on the treated ( ATT ) using inverse probability of treatment - weighted estimation . The ﬁnal sample contains information on 417 scientists ( 69 HHMIs and 348 controls ) . Eﬀects of HHMI appointment on citation impact . The ﬁrst four lines of Table 6 report the eﬀect of the program on the rate of publication output falling in distinct citation quantile bins : all publications , publications in the top quartile , in the top ﬁve percentiles , and in the top percentile . For each outcome variable , we present ﬁve coeﬃcients corresponding to diﬀerent ways of assessing the program’s eﬀects . The ﬁrst column reports naive cross - sectional results , which ignore the selection process . The second and third columns weight the outcome equations by the inverse probability of treatment so as to recover the Average Treatment Eﬀect ( ATE ) , and the Average Treatment Eﬀect on the Treated ( ATT ) under unconfoundedness . The fourth column reports simple conditional ﬁxed eﬀects estimates , a naive diﬀerence - in - diﬀerences ( DD ) . Finally , the ﬁfth column reports results corresponding to semi - parametric diﬀerence - in - diﬀerences ( SDD ) estimates as in Abadie ( 2005 ) . Since the SDD estimator adjusts the treatment eﬀect for selection on observables while purging the estimates of time - invariant unobserved heterogeneity , it is our preferred speciﬁcation . 22 Following a long - standing tradition in the study of scientiﬁc and technical change , the cross - sectional , ATE , ATT , and DD eﬀects are estimated on the full panel using quasi - maximum likelihood Poisson . 16 In contrast , the SDD eﬀects stem from a two - step procedure detailed in Appendix III . The naive cross - sectional estimate is always the largest in magnitude , and using propensity - score weighting reduces the magnitude of the eﬀect by approximately a third . In contrast , the DD estimate is systematically lower than the SDD estimate , as is possible if HHMIs and controls are on diﬀerent output trends even before appointment . The magnitudes of the eﬀects are large . For instance , the SDD estimates imply that the HHMI program increases the rate at which appointed scientists produce publications by e . 333 − 1 = 39 % ; the ﬁgure for articles in the Top 5 % of the citation distribution is 55 % ; and for articles in the Top 1 % , a 97 % increase . The observed pattern is that the program has a bigger eﬀect on the upper tail of the distribution of accomplishments , regardless of the estimation method used . Figure 4 display the time path of the average publication count ( Panel A ) and “Top 5 % ” outcome ( Panel B ) , for HHMIs and ECPWs separately . While computing the averages , we weight each control scientist’s outcome by his / her inverse probability of being selected into the program , while leaving the treated scientists’ outcomes unchanged . Loosely , Figures 4A and 4B provide a graphical intuition for the SDD estimates : they correspond to the diﬀerence between the change in outcomes for the HHMIs and for a pseudo - population of control scientists matched on observables . A necessary condition for the plausibility of this exercise is that the treated and control groups display parallel output trends prior to the appointment event . This appears to be the case here . Interestingly , for three years after appointment , the outcomes for treated and control scientists continue to track each other closely . Figure 4B even suggests that the control group ( appropriately selected on observables ) brieﬂy outpaces the treatment group follow - ing the appointment , consistent with Manso’s ( 2010 ) theory which predicts both slower and 16 Because the Poisson model is in the linear exponential family , the coeﬃcient estimates remain consistent as long as the mean of the dependent variable is correctly speciﬁed ( Wooldridge 1996 ; Santos Silva and Tenreyro 2006 ) . Further , robust standard errors are consistent even if the underlying data generating process is not Poisson . 23 more variable returns under an exploration incentive scheme . This diﬀerence is not statisti - cally signiﬁcant , however , which is perhaps unsurprising given our sample’s relatively small size . HHMIs’ output begins to diverge from that of ECPW’s only four to ﬁve years after appointment , and this divergence is more marked in Panel B . We have explored the hypothesis of a temporary , post - appointment slowdown qualita - tively by asking eight current and former HHMI investigators about the “retooling” necessary to take advantage of the freedom aﬀorded by HHMI . This idea resonated with these scien - tists , but it also seems clear that these lags are very heterogeneous across labs . Some of them mentioned waiting until their ﬁrst renewal before branching out ; others were clearly itching to begin new projects , for example by focusing on a new disease ( autism vs . Huntington’s ) , model organism ( mice vs . yeast ) , or discipline ( chemistry vs . cell biology ) . Still others describe a less deliberate exploration process whereby the logic of their traditional research projects opened up novel opportunities , which they could more easily take advantage of as HHMI investigators . Eﬀects of HHMI appointment on Failure . It seems intuitive that exploration would lead scientists to “strike out” more often . Measuring failure is diﬃcult , since it might lead researchers to abort projects altogether . Here we ask whether HHMIs produce more articles of little import , relative to controls . To answer this question , we examine whether HHMI appointment increases the rate of publications that fall in the bottom quartile of citations . Relative to ECPW scholars , HHMIs indeed fail more often , regardless of estimation method ; some of these estimates are large in magnitude , but they are also imprecisely estimated . The lack of statistical signiﬁcance is not terribly surprising since relatively few of the articles produced by these elite scientists will fail to garner the three citations that correspond to the 25 th percentile of the citation distribution in most years . An alternative approach is to use these scientists’ own citation impact prior to appoint - ment to assess their performance in the post - appointment regime , rather than a universal citation benchmark as above . The corresponding results are displayed in the last two lines of Table 6 . The coeﬃcient estimates pertain to the HHMI treatment eﬀect in cross sectional 24 comparisons where the rates of “hit” and “ﬂop” publications are modeled using QML Pois - son . To compute the number of hits , we count the number of times each scientist publishes an article whose citation quantile places it above the highest citation quantile of any article published prior to appointment . Symmetrically , the number of ﬂops is computed by counting the number of times each scientist publishes an article whose citation quantile places it below the lowest citation quantile of any article published prior to appointment ( further details are provided in Appendix IV ) . Since we use citation data for the entire pre - appointment period to compute individual citation benchmarks , there are no DD and SDD speciﬁcation for these two outcomes . We ﬁnd robust statistical evidence that HHMI appointment increases the frequency of both hits and ﬂops . We focus on the latter result since an increased rate of failure under an exploration incentive scheme is a strong prediction of the theory . It is also more challenging to reconcile with the view that HHMI simply picks extraordinarily talented scientists and then takes credit for their accomplishments . Of course , we cannot rule out a more nuanced selection story whereby the elite scientists who serve as judges in HHMI competitions are skilled at identifying scientists destined to push the scientiﬁc frontier outward . Eﬀects of HHMI appointment on NIH grant outcomes . In Table 7 , we document a negative association between HHMI appointment and NIH funding , which holds both in the cross - sectional and the within - scientist dimension of the data . This eﬀect corresponds in large part to a mechanical substitution of HHMI resources for traditional NIH funding : the number of R01 grant applications by HHMI investigators is , on average , only about 60 % of the corresponding number for ECPW scholars . But application behavior does not on its own explain the decline in NIH funding ; conditional on applying , applications from HHMI scien - tists receive higher priority scores ( i . e . , are judged more harshly by study sections ) . When combined with the results pertaining to citation impact , this evidence supports the view that the punctiliousness of the NIH peer - review process crowds out scientiﬁc exploration . 17 17 More prosaically , they might put less eﬀort in preparing these proposals , since they beneﬁt from the safety of Hughes funding . 25 Eﬀects of HHMI appointment on the direction of research . So far , our presentation of results has conﬂated intensity of exploration with the rate at which tail outcomes are produced . But taken literally , the Manso ( 2010 ) model does not predict that “pay - for - future performance” incentives will result in better outcomes ; it simply asserts that agents subject to those incentives will increase their rates of exploration , relative to agents who receive piece rates . This is the hypothesis we examine in Table 8 . Choosing less traveled scientiﬁc avenues could also leave trails in the content of what scientists publish , and in particular aﬀect the keywords that tag their publications . We ﬁrst focus on whether HHMI investigators are prone to deﬁne the scientiﬁc frontier , by examining the vintage of the MeSH keywords in their output . In our analysis , a keyword is born the earliest year in which it appears in any publication indexed by PubMED . We then compute the average age of all keywords or all keyword pairs in each scientist’s yearly output . Table 8 shows that HHMIs indeed tackle more novel topics ; the coeﬃcient estimates are negative regardless of estimation method . Next , we ask whether evidence exists that HHMIs alter the direction of their scientiﬁc trajectory following their appointment . We ﬁrst examine the program’s eﬀect on the num - ber of unique publication keywords that overlap between the set of articles published in the “before period” ( 1986 - 1994 ) and the “after” period ( 1998 - 2006 ) . This measure is then nor - malized by the number of unique keyword used in the after period . For each control group , we report both the results of a “na¨ıve” speciﬁcation , and the results of two speciﬁcations which incorporate inverse probability of treatment weights corresponding to ATE and ATT , respectively . Since the dependent variable is a proportion , we estimate these model using the quasi - maximum likelihood fractional logit estimator of Papke and Wooldridge ( 1996 ) . Relative to ECPW scholars , HHMIs exhibit unambiguously lower overlap in keyword use . The eﬀects are statistically signiﬁcant , and imply that HHMI appointment is associated with about a 10 % lower rate of overlap . Our last test focuses on the breadth — rather than the depth — of impact for these scientists’s publications . To do so , we examine the journals in which citing articles appear , and compute the Herﬁndahl of journal concentration H . We ﬁnd that HHMI’s exhibit higher levels of ( 1 − H ) in the post - appointment period , i . e . , their work is cited by more diverse 26 set of journals than the articles published by ECPWs . Overall , the results in Table 8 are consistent with the idea that HHMIs broaden their research agenda in the post - appointment period , a necessary condition for exploration . Incentives vs . alternative mechanisms . Even if our estimates of HHMI appointments’ treatment eﬀects can be given a causal interpretation , ascribing them to the program’s incentive features requires an interpretive leap . First , we are unable to ascertain the extent to which the program increases productivity , rather than output . It is hard to compare directly HHMI and NIH levels of funding , since the two programs are structured in a diﬀerent fashion . 18 Yet , it appears likely that , per dollar of funding , HHMI investigators do not publish more articles than researchers funded by the NIH . Of course , if the supply of genuinely creative ideas is very inelastic , then publications per dollar of funding will not adequately measure researchers’ productivity . 19 We also note that the results pertaining to the diversity of experimentation are less vulnerable to this critique , since they essentially hold output constant . Second , the prestige conferred by HHMI appointment might have independent eﬀects on scientists’ achievements , either by increasing exposure to their research , or through a dynamic of ascription that has long been the focus of sociologists of science ( Merton 1968 ) . Azoulay , Stuart , and Wang ( 2010 ) provide estimates of the HHMI investigator program’s “anointment eﬀects” by examining whether appointment shifts the citation rate of articles written in the pre - appointment period ; their evidence points to eﬀects of very modest magnitude . As such , an interpretation of our results that emphasizes the status beneﬁts of HHMI appointment appears unwarranted . Third , collaboration between scientists in the treatment and control groups might threaten the validity of the comparisons drawn in the analysis . Fifty nine out of the seventy three 18 For example , HHMI does not pay host institutions standard overhead rates , but does make a contribution towards rent and occupancy . 19 In a recent article , Jacob and Lefgren ( 2007 ) estimate that the elasticity of citations with respect to NIH R01 grant funding is quite small in magnitude , and often insigniﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0 . Given their regression - discontinuity design , it would be hazardous to import their estimate for the analysis of the scientist population analyzed in the present study . 27 HHMI investigators have at least one control collaborator ; 10 have ﬁve or more . However , peer eﬀects from coauthorship ( e . g . , Azoulay , Graﬀ Zivin , and Wang 2010 ) , which enhance the accomplishments of the control group , would tend to dampen the magnitudes of the eﬀects estimated above . A more subtle reinterpretation of our main results is that “explorer types” are more likely to seek HHMI appointment . A sorting process in this vein would imply that the freedom and long - term funding bundled with HHMI appointment have real eﬀects , even if they do not really induce behavioral changes in the treated group . However , a peculiar feature of the HHMI appointment process is that candidates do not apply , but rather are nominated by their universities who are endowed by HHMI with a very limited number of nomination slots . This casts doubt on the sorting interpretation at the principal investigator level . It is altogether more likely ( and also more feasible ) for talented postdoctoral researchers and graduate students with idiosyncratic tastes for exploration to sort themselves into HHMI - funded labs . The fact that HHMI labs train a much higher number of young scientists who go on to win early career prizes is consistent with a sorting process at the level of trainees . In summary , we argue the diﬀerences observed between HHMI investigators and controls are likely to be driven by the program’s distinct incentive features , as opposed to other potential eﬀects of HHMI appointment . 5 Conclusion In this article , we exploit key diﬀerences across funding streams within the academic life sciences to examine the impact of incentives embodied in research contracts on the rate of scientiﬁc exploration . We ﬁnd that selection into the HHMI investigator program — which rewards long - term success , encourages intellectual experimentation , and provides rich feedback to its appointees — leads to higher levels of breakthrough innovation , compared with NIH funding — which is characterized by short grant cycles , pre - deﬁned deliverables , and unforgiving renewal policies . Moreover , the magnitudes of these eﬀects are quite large . 28 Our ﬁndings are important for at least two reasons . First , they demonstrate the impact of nuanced features of research contracts for the rate and direction of scientiﬁc progress . Given the prominent role that scientiﬁc change is presumed to play in the process of economic growth ( e . g . , Mokyr 2002 ) , this has important implications for the organization of public and private research institutions . Second , they oﬀer empirical support for the theoretical model developed by Manso ( 2010 ) , and as such may provide insights relevant to a wider set of industries that rely on creative professionals , ranging from advertising and computer programming to leadership roles at the upper echelons of the corporate world . Finally , our results should not be interpreted as a critique of NIH and its funding policies . While “exploration” incentive contracts appear to stimulate creativity in this setting , it is unclear how easily , and at what cost , the program could be scaled up . Only scientists showing exceptional promise are eligible for HHMI appointment , and our results may not generalize to the overall population of scientists eligible for grant funding , which include gifted individuals as well as those with more modest talent . Moreover , HHMI provides detailed evaluation and feedback to its investigators . The richness of this feedback consumes a great deal of resources , particularly the time of the elite scientists that serve on review panels , and its quality might degrade if the program was expanded drastically . It is also vital to recognize that NIH operates under political constraints that a private foundation like HHMI can safely ignore . For instance , all public research agencies need to spread their support across many institutions , including those of lesser renown . Similarly , supporting individual projects , rather than individual scientists , introduces a level of imper - sonality in the funding decisions that may make them easier to defend vis - a - vis congressional appropriators . Much more could be done to explore the impacts of contract design on research output in this setting . For example , do the quality of peers at these investigators’ institution temper or magnify these eﬀects ? Do the eﬀects of exploration - style incentives exhibit hysteresis , i . e . , do they lead scientists to be more creative under more conventional contractual arrangements ? Answering these questions are the next steps of our research agenda . 29 30 References Abadie , A . “Semiparametric Difference - in - Differences Estimators . ” Review of Economic Studies , Vol . 72 , ( 2005 ) , pp . 1 – 19 .

R & D PPI , base year = 2006 The amounts exclude NIH center grants ( P01 , M01 , U01 , etc . ) Notes : To compute baseline article counts , we focus on articles in which the scientist appears in last position on the authorship list , because this is the set that clearly identifies both treated and controls as principal investigators in the pre - appointment period . To compute NIH funding totals , we exclude research center grants because these grants are less likely to correspond to individual effort ; in some cases , deans or department chairs serve as pro - forma PIs on such grants , making it a less useful measure for our purposes . 34 Figure 4 Dynamics of HHMI Appointment on “Hits” A .

The averages for the control scientists are weighted by each researcher’s inverse probability of treatment , where the weights are computed using fitted values of the logit specification . The dashed light gray line corresponds to the unweighted average yearly number of articles for the control scientists . Panel A displays our results for total publications ( regardless of impact ) , whereas Panel B restricts the outcome data to “hits” ( publications that fall in the top five percentiles of the vintage - specific article - level distribution of citations ) . 35 Table 1 Comparison Between the Two Sources of Funding NIH R01 Grants HHMI Investigator Program 3 - to 5 - year funding 5 - year funding first review is similar to any other review first review is rather lax funds dry up upon non - renewal two - year phase - down upon non - renewal some feedback in the renewal process feedback from renowned scientists funding is for a particular project “people , not projects” 36 Table 2 Descriptive Statistics – Baseline Mean Median Std .

Estimates derive from QML Poisson estimation , with robust standard errors in parentheses , clustered around scientist ( X - section , ATE , ATT , and DD columns ) ; bootstrapped standard errors are reported for the semi - parametric diff - in - diffs estimates . All specifications except the naïve cross - sections and the plain diffs - in - diffs include regression weights computed using fitted values for the probability of HHMI appointment estimated in Table 5 . The weights differ depending on whether ATT or ATE is the effect of interest , and whether the focus is on generating a between - scientist comparison ( ATE & ATT columns ) , or a within - scientist comparison ( SDD column ) . See section 3 in the text for more details . The last two lines of the table use each scientist’s own citation impact in the pre - appointment period as a benchmark . We code the highest ( resp . lowest ) quantile of the article - level citation distribution for any article published by each scientist prior to appointment . We then compute the number of hits ( resp . flops ) for each scientist by counting the number of articles whose citation quantile place them above ( resp . below ) this level in the post - appointment period . The corresponding specifications also include year of highest degree indicator variables , three lab type indicator variables , a gender indicator variable , two degree type indicator variables as well as the pre - appointment highest or lowest pre - appointment quantile mentioned above . Because we use the whole pre - appointment citation data to calculate the benchmark , there are no DD or SDD specifications when assessing citation impact relative to the scientists’ own prior performance . † p < 0 . 10 , * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 . 41 Table 7 Effects of HHMI Appointment on NIH Funding Depndt .

Funding Speciﬁc Projects We develop a simple model to contrast the “speciﬁc project” and the “people , not projects” approaches to scientiﬁc funding . The researcher lives for two periods . In each period , she chooses a project i ∈ I , producing output S ( “success” ) with a probability p i or output F ( “failure” ) with probability 1 − p i . The probability p i of success when the researcher chooses project i may be unknown . To obtain information about p i , she must engage in experimentation . We let E [ p i ] denote the unconditional expectation of p i , E [ p i | S , j ] denote the conditional expectation of p i given a success on project j , and E [ p i | F , j ] denote the conditional expectation of p i given a failure on project j . When the researcher chooses project i ∈ I , she only learns about the probability p i , so that E [ p j ] = E [ p j | S , i ] = E [ p j | F , i ] for j (cid:54) = i . The central concern that arises is the tension between exploration of new ideas and the exploitation of already existing ideas along conventional lines ( March , 1991 ) . To focus on the tension between exploration and exploitation , we assume that in each period the researcher chooses between two projects . Project 1 , the “conventional” research project , has a known probability p 1 of success , such that p 1 = E [ p 1 ] = E [ p 1 | S , 1 ] = E [ p 1 | F , 1 ] . Project 2 , the innovative research project , has an unknown probability p 2 of success such that E [ p 2 | F , 2 ] < E [ p 2 ] < E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] . We assume that the innovative research project is of an exploratory nature . This means that when the researcher experiments with the innovative research project , she is initially not as likely to succeed as when she treads a well - trodden path , as is the case with the conventional research project . However , if she succeeds with the innovative project , she updates her beliefs about p 2 , so that choosing the innovative project becomes perceived as superior to choosing the conventional project . This is captured by : E [ p 2 ] < p 1 < E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] . ( 1 ) The researcher is risk - neutral and has a discount factor normalized to one . Her objective function R assigns some weight α to the outcome produced by his research as well as some weight to her private preferences between the two projects . These private preferences are represented with a cost c i that is incurred by the researcher whenever she pursues project i . The researcher thus chooses an action plan (cid:104) i j k (cid:105) to maximize her total expected payoﬀ R ( (cid:104) i jk (cid:105) ) = { E [ p i ] S + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) F − c i } + E [ p i ] { E [ p j | S , i ] S + ( 1 − E [ p j | S , i ] ) F − c j } + ( 1 − E [ p i ] ) { E [ p k | F , i ] S + ( 1 − E [ p k | F , i ] ) F − c k } ( 2 ) where i is the ﬁrst - period action , j is the second - period action in case of success in the ﬁrst period , and k is the second - period action in case of failure in the ﬁrst period . We assume that the researcher gets enough funding to perform research during the two periods . We consider two funding mechanisms : the “speciﬁc project” approach and the “people , not projects” approach . The “Speciﬁc Project” approach . Under this approach the researcher must choose one project to submit for funding and must work on that project during the two periods . Two action plans need to be considered : 43 (cid:104) 111 (cid:105) and (cid:104) 222 (cid:105) . If the researcher chooses action plan (cid:104) 111 (cid:105) his total expected payoﬀ is R ( (cid:104) 111 (cid:105) ) = { E [ p 1 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) F − c 1 } + E [ p 1 ] { E [ p 1 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) F − c 1 } + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) { E [ p 1 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) F − c 1 } ( 3 ) If the researcher chooses action plan (cid:104) 222 (cid:105) his total expected payoﬀ is R ( (cid:104) 222 (cid:105) ) = { E [ p 2 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) F − c 2 } + E [ p 2 ] { E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) F − c 2 } + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) { E [ p 2 | F , 2 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 2 | F , 2 ] ) F − c 2 } ( 4 ) From Bayes’ rule , the payoﬀ R ( (cid:104) 222 (cid:105) ) is higher than the payoﬀ R ( (cid:104) 111 (cid:105) ) if and only if α ( E [ p 2 ] − p 1 ) ( S − F ) ≥ ( c 2 − c 1 ) . ( 5 ) The “People , not Projects” approach . Under this approach , the researcher can choose any of the two projects in each period . Two action plans need to be considered : (cid:104) 111 (cid:105) , and action plan (cid:104) 221 (cid:105) . If the researcher chooses action plan (cid:104) 111 (cid:105) , her total expected payoﬀ is R ( (cid:104) 111 (cid:105) ) = { E [ p 1 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) F − c 1 } + E [ p 1 ] { E [ p 1 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) F − c 1 } + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) { E [ p 1 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) F − c 1 } ( 6 ) If the researcher chooses action plan (cid:104) 221 (cid:105) , her total expected payoﬀ is R ( (cid:104) 221 (cid:105) ) = { E [ p 2 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) F − c 2 } + E [ p 2 ] { E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] ) F − c 2 } + ( 1 − E [ p 2 ] ) { E [ p 1 ] S + ( 1 − E [ p 1 ] ) F − c 1 } ( 7 ) The payoﬀ R ( (cid:104) 221 (cid:105) ) is higher than R ( (cid:104) 111 (cid:105) ) if and only if α { ( E [ p 2 ] ( E [ p 2 | S , 2 ] − p 1 ) + ( E [ p 2 ] − p 1 ) } ( S − F ) ≥ ( 1 + E [ p 2 ] ) ( c 2 − c 1 ) ( 8 ) The following proposition contrasts exploration under “speciﬁc project” funding and “people , not projects” funding . Proposition 1 If the agent explores under “speciﬁc project” funding , he also explores under “people , not projects” funding . However , there are situations in which the agent explores under “people , not projects” funding , but exploits under “speciﬁc project” funding . Proof The ﬁrst statement follows from the fact that ( 5 ) implies ( 8 ) . For the second statement , we construct the following example . If c 2 > c 1 , ( 5 ) implies that the agent never explores under the “speciﬁc project” approach . However , from ( 8 ) , if the payoﬀ from exploration is suﬃciently high , the agent will explore under the “people , not projects” approach . 44 Appendix B Career & Output Data For every scientist in the control or treatment group , we collected career information from three sources : original CVs / NIH biosketches ; Who’s Who proﬁles , and Google searches . In practice , the combination of these approaches enabled us to ﬁnd employment and demographic data for all the investigators considered in the article . Matching these individuals with NIH grant information is not challenging since both full names and institutional aﬃliations can be used . Getting a precise tally of publications at the individual level is more involved . We will describe this process using as an example Mario Capecchi , the Nobel Prize winner ( and HHMI ) mentioned in the introduction . The matching process begins with the creation of a customized PubMED search query for each scientist . In the case of Capecchi , the query is ( ( " capecchi mr " [ au ] OR " capecchi m " [ au ] ) NOT 7816017 [ pmid ] AND 1966 : 2006 [ dp ] ) , and it returns 122 original publications ( the query also returns 19 letters , editori - als , interviews , reviews , etc . , which we ignore ) . The process of harvesting bibliomes from PubMED using name variations and queries as inputs is facilitated by the use of PubHarvester , a software program we speciﬁcally designed for this purpose ( Azoulay , Stellman , and Graﬀ Zivin 2006 ) . Capecchi’s PubMED query accounts for his inconsistent use of the middle initial , but is otherwise quite simple . For other scientists , queries might factor in their inconsistent use of the suﬃx “Jr . , ” or name variations coincident with changes in marital status . For yet many others with frequent names , the queries are more involved , and make use of CV information such as scientiﬁc keywords , institutional aﬃliation , frequent coauthors’ names , etc . This degree of labor - intensive customization ensures that a scientist’s bibliome excludes publications belonging to homonymous scientists . Appendix C Estimation Procedure for the Semiparametric DD Estimates The ATE , ATT , and DD eﬀects stem from panel speciﬁcations ; the sample size is equal to the total number of independent career years for each scientist ( N × T = 8 , 767 or N × T = 3 , 832 , depending on the control group ) . The procedure followed to estimate the SDD eﬀects is slightly diﬀerent . We ﬁrst regress the various measures of output on calendar year and age indicator variables using the full panel , and compute the residuals ε it . In a second step , we sum the residuals corresponding to the pre - appointment ( 1986 - 1994 ) and post - appointment ( 1998 - 2006 ) periods separately for each scientist . In the ﬁnal step , the SDD eﬀects are obtained by regressing (cid:80) 1994 t = 1986 ε it − (cid:80) 2006 t = 1998 ε it on treatment status , weighting these diﬀerences as described in section 3 . Note that the sample size corresponds in this case to the number of scientists ( N = 466 or N = 165 , depending on the control group ) , not the number of scientist - year observations . Appendix D Scientist - Speciﬁc Citation Benchmarks We illustrate the computation of the number of hits and ﬂops using the example of Iva Greenwald , an HHMI investigator from Columbia University . Prior to 1994 ( the year of her appointment ) , her publication with the highest citation quantile is an article which appeared in the journal Cell in 1993 ( 341 citations as 45 of the end of 2008 , which places it in the top percentile of the article - level distribution ) . Conversely , her publication with the lowest citation quantile is an article which appeared in the journal Molecular & Cellular Biology , also in 1993 . It garnered only 11 citations , which places it at the 52 nd percentile of the distribution . Between 1995 and 2006 , Greenwald published three more publications in the top percentile of the citation distribution , given their vintage . And she published three more publications which fell in the 32 nd , 44 th , and 50 th percentile of the distribution in the years they were published . As a result , both the number of “hits , ” and that of “ﬂops , ” is equal to three for this investigator . Estimation . Since we use the entire pre - appointment data to compute citation benchmarks speciﬁc to each individual scientist , we can only analyze the eﬀect of HHMI appointment on these measures of impact using the cross - sectional dimension of the data , collapsing all post - appointment years into a single observation for each scientist . For the number of ﬂops , the equation we estimate can be written E [ FLOPS i | X i ] = exp (cid:16) β 0 + β 1 HHMI i + β (cid:48) 2 Z i + β 3 MIN QNTL i + φ ( SCIENTIST AGE i ) (cid:17) ( 9 ) where HHMI denotes the treatment eﬀect , the variables in Z include degree type , lab type , and gender indicator variables , MIN QNTL is the citation quantile corresponding to scientist i ’s least impactful article published prior to appointment , i and φ ( SCIENTIST AGE i ) is a ﬂexible function of scientist i ’s career age — in practice a full set of indicator variables for the diﬀerent years in which our scientists received their highest degree . Estimation proceeds by quasi - maximum likelihood . In some of the speciﬁcations , the data is weighted to reﬂect each scientist’s inverse probability to be appointed to the program , as explained in section 3 . i In the case of hits , the corresponding speciﬁcation includes MAX QNTL — the citation quantile corresponding to scien - tist i ’s most impactful article published prior to appointment — as an independent variable . 46
