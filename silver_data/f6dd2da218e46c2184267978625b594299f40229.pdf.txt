The method works by compressing a cell between parallel surfaces whilst measuring the force being imposed on the cell , and its deformation . The mean bursting force for two - week - old cells was 3 . 6 mN ( standard error 0 . 1 mN ) , at a compression speed of 23 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 . Usually force - deformation curves showed a single bursting event , but sometimes multiple bursts were observed , implying cells could reseal after failure . If cells were deformed without bursting , and then held , they showed a relaxation of the force . This was attributed to water loss , although wall relaxation was also a possibility . The half time of this relaxation was between 1 – 10 s . Tests on protoplasts gave bursting forces 1000 fold lower than intact cells , and cells treated with Triton to disrupt the membranes and destroy turgor collapsed with no bursting . As expected , both turgor and the presence of a wall were essential to maintaining cell strength . Introduction Micromanipulation can be used to measure the me - chanical response to compression of single suspension cells of many types ( Thomas et al . 2000 ) . In this method , a cell is compressed between two notionally inﬁnite , parallel ﬂat surfaces and the force required to deform and break ( i . e . , burst ) the cell is measured . Analysis of the force - deformation traces can provide useful mechanical property data . The method has been used to study the mechanical strength of various types of cell : animal cells ( Zhang et al . 1991 ) , yeast cells ( Mashmoushy et al . 1998 ) , bacteria ( Shiu et al . 1999 ) , and has now been modiﬁed to allow for the larger size and greater strength of plant cells . The most important components of individual plant cells inﬂuencing the mechanical properties are the cell wall and the plasmalemma . Although there would be no turgor without the semi - permeability of the latter , the wall provides a strong shell to resist the turgor mechanically . The plasmalemma alone could not maintain the high pressures found in typical plant cells ( 0 . 3 – 1 MPa ; Cosgrove 1999 ) . The interaction be - tween the wall and the turgor provides an individual cell with rigidity and strength , and these properties un - derpin the strength of plant tissues , which is important for plants in the environment and for the behaviour of plants in processing . The relationship between the composition and the structure of the plant cell wall , and the cell me - chanical properties is not fully understood . The main strengthening component is regarded to be a matrix of cellulose microﬁbrils , the quantity and arrangement of which varies according to cell type and age ( Fry 1995 ) . However , the contribution to the mechanical proper - ties of other wall components , and the interaction of those components and the cellulose microﬁbrils is not yet clear ( Cosgrove 1999 ) . Mechanical tests on iso - lated walls have indicated that the cell wall material is non - linear viscoelastic - plastic ( e . g . , Kawamura et al . 1995 ) . However , these studies were on walls treated to remove enzymes and were mostly uniaxial stretch - 1878 Fig . 1 . A schematic diagram of the micromanipulation apparatus . ing tests . Attempts have been made to simulate turgor and multiaxial tensions in some experiments ( Kamiya et al . 1963 , Richmond et al . 1980 ) , but it would be preferable to study walls in situ with the actual turgor and original geometry of living cells . The properties of living and dead cells with growing or non - growing walls may be different . The pressure probe is an excellent tool for studying plant water relations ( Tribuolot et al . 1995 , Tomos & Pritchard 1994 , Tomos 2000 ) , and can provide some mechanical property measurements . However , it has rarely been used on single suspension cells , and only subjects cells to small deformations , not to bursting . One means of studying cell strength is to break the cells in a gas decompression bomb ( Carpita 1985 ) . However , the results of this method are difﬁcult to interpret , not least because the breakage mechanism may not be decompression alone . In addition , the bomb provides average breaking strengths rather than individual cell information . Micromanipulation has the potential to provide mechanical property information at the individual cell level , with deformations up to cell bursting . The burst - ing force is taken as a measure of cell strength . In this work it is shown how existing micromanipula - tion methods were modiﬁed to work on plant cells from suspension cultures , and data using the method are presented for two - week - old tomato cells , their protoplasts , and Triton treated cells with disrupted membranes .

Materials and methods Cell culturing and isolation of single cells The tomato cell line Lycopersicon esculentum vf36 was used as a model system . This is a suspension cul - ture derived from a root radicle callus ( provided by Unilever Research Colworth , Bedford , UK ) . The cells were subcultured weekly in medium consisting of MS basal salts ( 43 g for 10 l ) , 30 g sucrose l (cid:0) 1 , 2 mg 2 , 4 - D l (cid:0) 1 , 1 mg 2 - iP l (cid:0) 1 and 50 (cid:22) l vitamin solution ( 100 mg nicotinic acid , 40 mg glycine , 10 mg pyri - doxine hydrochloride , 10 mg thiamine hydrochloride , 10 mg folic acid , 1 mg biotin , 20 ml water ) . The pH was 6 . 0 . The cells were grown in a horizontal rotary 1879 shaker set at 100 rpm and 25 (cid:14) C with low light . Sus - pension cultures obtained by this method are nearly in synchronous growth , and so the cells within a sample are of similar age . Single cells were evident in the culture from week 2 and passage through a 72 (cid:22) m mesh separated them from any aggregates . The single cells were suspended in 0 . 03 M mannitol at pH 5 , the same osmolality ( 3 bar ) and pH as the medium . They were held at 27 (cid:14) C during testing . These cells were known to be viable due to their appearance , and by staining sam - ples from the same culture with Neutral Red using a protocol modiﬁed from Gahan ( 1984 ) to contain a lower concentration of KNO 3 ( 60 mM ) . Micromanipulation method The basic micromanipulation technique was that de - scribed by Mashmoushy et al . ( 1998 ) . A schematic diagram of the apparatus is shown in Figure 1 . The cells were compressed between the ﬂat end of an op - tic ﬁbre ( the micromanipulation probe ) and a glass surface ( see Figure 2 ) . The probe was mounted on a force transducer , which in turn was mounted on a micromanipulator ( MicroInstruments Ltd . , Oxford , UK ) . This allowed the probe to be driven at a cho - sen speed towards the slide , compressing the cell . The force and the time of deformation could be recorded on a PC - 30D data acquisition card ( Amplicon Live - line , Brighton , UK ) in a personal computer . Using the speed of motion of the probe , and allowing for com - pliance ( Mashmoushy et al . 1998 ) , the probe displace - ment and the cell deformation could be measured , and a force - deformation curve generated . Although this method has been used on other cell types ( Zhang et al . 2000 ) , a few important modiﬁcations were necessary for its use with tomato cells . The main alterations re - quired were due to the large size and strength of these cells , which were of diameters of up to 90 (cid:22) m . It was essential to use a probe with a diameter of 200 (cid:22) m to provide the ‘inﬁnite’ ﬂat surface required for com - pression . The probe was ﬁtted to a transducer that could measure the forces required to deform and burst tomato suspension cells . A suitable transducer was a series 400 ( Aurora Scientiﬁc Inc . , Canada ) which could measure up to 5 g f and had a claimed resolution of (cid:6) 100 (cid:22) g f . The cells were large enough to allow good vis - ibility of events from the side during deformation ( Figure 2 ) , as well as from below . To allow clear focusing , the cell suspension was no longer placed on a slide as with other cell types , but instead into a chamber of 1 mm width ( Figure 1 ) . This allowed a second microscope to be brought close to the cell under test . Besides providing visual observations of the compression events , this side view capability al - lowed the measurement ( by graticule ) of the height of the cell before deformation , a measure of the initial cell diameter . Often the forces at the beginning of the compression were not large enough to be within the range of the transducer , so knowing the size meant that it was possible to calculate when the compression began on the force - deformation curves . The temperature of the cells during deformation was 27 (cid:14) C . Deformation of untreated cells Cells , 14 days old , were deformed until they burst or the probe and the surface of the chamber had touched ( ‘complete deformation’ ) . The compression speeds used were 6 , 23 and 43 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 using a preset moving distance of 120 (cid:22) m . Fifty cells were tested for each speed . Deformation of protoplasts and turgorless cells As a comparison , 10 cells treated with 5 % ( w / v ) Triton to remove the membranes ( hence abolishing turgor ) were subjected to complete deformation . In addition , protoplasts were tested . These were prepared by in - cubating 20 ml of cell suspension in 40 ml of an enzyme cocktail of 0 . 4 M mannitol , 1 % ( w / v ) cellu - lase , 1 % ( w / v ) hemicellulase , 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) pectinase and 0 . 005 M CaCl 2 (cid:1) 2H 2 0 at pH 5 . 8 for 5 – 6 h at 25 (cid:14) C in darkness . Ten protoplasts were subjected to complete deformations . The moving speed was 23 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 . Because of the lower forces required to deform turgorless cells , a series 406A transducer ( Au - rora Scientiﬁc Inc . , Canada ) with a maximum force reading of 0 . 05 g f and a claimed resolution of (cid:6) 1 (cid:22) g f was used . Relaxation experiments ( or ‘squeeze - hold - release’ experiments ) Cells , 14 days old , were compressed to a chosen defor - mation at a pre - set speed and held at this deformation for 60 s whilst still recording the force . The deforma - tion was not high enough to cause bursting . Using this method , one experiment compared two sets of cells compressed to 30 % deformation using two speeds ( 6 and 23 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 ) . Another experiment compared two 1880 Table 1 .

Results and discussion Figure 3a is a force - deformation trace for the most common deformation behaviour shown by tomato sus - pension cells . It should be noted that the deformations were very large , compared for example to those of the pressure probe method ( Zhang et al . 2000 ) . Fig - ure 3a shows a single bursting event and the bursting force and percentage deformation at bursting can be obtained directly from such a trace . A less usual type of compression behaviour was a multiple burst ( Figure 3b ) . In this case , the cell was deformed to a point where its cell wall and mem - brane failed , releasing cell contents , but then there followed a number of other bursting events . This be - haviour was also clearly visible on the video monitor . This behaviour has not previously been seen from Fig . 4 . Bursting force against cell height for cells compressed at 23 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 . other cell types and is , as far as is known , unique to plant cells . A reason for multiple bursting could be that the plasmalemma had time to reseal after the ﬁrst 1881 Fig . 5 . A typical relaxation trace showing the method of estimating the half - time T 1 = 2 . burst , and the hole in the wall was not catastrophic enough to prevent it from continuing to support the plasmalemma . There were not enough data to show a signiﬁcant difference ( if any ) between the bursting forces for single bursts and the ﬁrst bursting force for multiple bursts . It was decided to combine these mea - surements in estimating the mean bursting force of a sample . A very small number of cells did not burst at all ( Figure 3c ) . A typical cell showing this behaviour would buckle easily as the probe compressed it down to a ﬂat disc , with no failure of the wall . There was no release of any of the visible cell contents . This behav - iour was very uncommon and may have indicated that the cells were no longer viable . The scatter for bursting force versus cell height for the cells compressed at 23 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 is shown in Figure 4 . The mean cell height was 68 (cid:22) m ( stan - dard error (cid:6) 1 (cid:22) m ) and the mean bursting force was 3 . 6 mN ( standard error (cid:6) 0 . 2 mN ) . Previous microma - nipulation work on other cell types ( Shiu et al . 1999 ) has shown a correlation between bursting force and cell size . However , tomato suspension cells showed a much greater scatter and range of forces . Although Figure 4 suggests some such correlation , the scatter means that any relationship is not statistically signif - icant . The scatter may have been due to biological variations within a sample , such as differences in tur - gor or wall strength . Ideally , many more cells would be characterised in each sample . However , characterising 50 cells took 8 h , and longer experimental times would have risked physiological changes to the sample . The control experiment ( data not shown ) suggested that there were no signiﬁcant changes to the cell properties whilst they were being held for testing . Table 2 . Proportions of single and multiple bursts at differ - ent compression speeds . Compression speed Multiple bursts Single bursts ( (cid:22) ms (cid:0) 1 ) ( % ) ( % ) 6 66 34 23 38 62 43 25 75 The relaxation experiment showed that if a cell is held at a constant deformation , the force is seen to decay to an apparent equilibrium ( Figure 5 ) . If the relaxation is characterised by its half - time T 1 = 2 , then the typical timescale was 1 – 10 s . On its own , the trace can only indicate what might be happening to cause this relaxation . However , it is likely to have been a result of water loss , probably through aquaporins in the membrane ( Chrispeel & Maurel 1994 ) . Wall relax - ation is less likely , as the time scale was much shorter than that usually associated with cell expansion and growth ( Cosgrove 1999 ) . Table 1 shows the T 1 = 2 values taken for the dif - ferent compression speeds and deformations . Qualita - tively , there appeared to be small differences . How - ever , statistical analysis showed that these were not signiﬁcant for the number of cells tested . There was also no signiﬁcant difference in the bursting forces at compression speeds of 6 , 23 and 43 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 . The mean bursting forces for cells compressed at the three speeds were 3 . 7 mN ( standard error (cid:6) 0 . 2 mN ) for 6 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 , 3 . 6 mN ( (cid:6) 0 . 2 mN ) for 23 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 and 3 . 4 mN ( (cid:6) 0 . 2 mN ) for 43 (cid:22) m s (cid:0) 1 . This means that the relaxation , however caused , was not signiﬁcantly affecting the force required to burst the cells , at least for the limited range of speeds used here . This is po - tentially useful , as it means that bursting forces might be compared directly . Nevertheless , the causes of the relaxation and its inﬂuence need further investigation , because it is important to understand the cell response to deformation . An interesting observation was the change with compression speed of the proportions of single and multiple bursts ( Table 2 ) . The proportion of the latter decreased with speed increases , whilst the number of single bursts increased . Compression speed changes seemed to result in different behaviour but had no signiﬁcant effects on the ( ﬁrst ) bursting force . The mechanisms underlying this observation are unknown . 1882 The sieving method of obtaining single cells had an element of selection to it and there was a risk that the cells did not represent the whole sample . However , unpublished analysis indicated that there were mini - mal compositional differences between aggregates and single cells , and it was assumed that they would have similar mechanical behaviour . There does not appear to be a better method of separation , as mechanically or chemically separated cells are probably damaged . Protoplasts and Triton treated cells No bursting was seen when Triton treated cells were compressed . This is consistent with their having no intact membranes to retain turgor . Therefore there was only the low resistance of the walls to the ﬂow of cellular ﬂuid out of the cell . The pores in the wall are unlikely to limit ﬂow to the same extent as the plasmalemma because of their much larger size ( Titel et al . 1997 ) . This behaviour can be linked to those untreated cells that showed no bursting during com - pression . These cells may no longer be viable because their membranes may not be intact . A barely detectable bursting force was seen for protoplasts , even with the more sensitive force trans - ducer . The mean bursting force was 0 . 003 mN ( (cid:6) 0 . 001 mN ) . This was at least 1000 - fold lower than intact cells . This indicates the necessity of a wall to hold the turgor and provide the necessary resistance to external forces . There was no signiﬁcant rigidity of the protoplast . Conclusions The micromanipulation method can provide valuable information about the mechanical behaviour of sin - gle cells of plants , under large deformations . Bursting forces measured at a chosen speed will allow a com - parison of the strengths of cells of different strains , and how cell strength varies with environmental con - ditions . Further work is needed to understand the multiple burst phenomenon and the relaxation process . The side view should allow the use of image analy - sis for more detailed investigations of the size and shape of cells during compression . It may be possible to measure the water loss during relaxation directly , and therefore to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of the plasmalemma . Application of a mechanical model such as that used by Smith et al . ( 2000a , b ) on yeast cells could then be used to estimate material prop - erties of the cell wall , and to determine how these are affected by changes in environmental conditions . The method as it stands can be applied to any single plant cell to compare cell types and for studying bio - mechanical issues related to physiology and industrial processing .
