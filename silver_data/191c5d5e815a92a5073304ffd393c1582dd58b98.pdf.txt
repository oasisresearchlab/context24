These biochemical processes in turn support critical cellular functions such as cell proliferation , mitochondrial respiration , and epigenetic regulation . Not surprisingly , abnormal folate metabolism has been causally linked with a myriad of diseases . In this review , we provide a historical perspective , delve into folate chemistry that is often overlooked , and point out various missing links and underdeveloped areas in folate metabolism for future exploration . Toward a better understanding of folate metabolism in health and disease Yuxiang Zheng and Lewis C . Cantley  Rockefeller University Press Introduction In 1931 , Lucy Wills reported that an unusual form of anemia , macrocytic anemia , could be cured by yeast extracts , suggesting that the disease is a nutritional deficiency ( Carpenter , 2003a , b ) . Soon thereafter , many groups were racing to identify the ac - tive nutrient , later named folic acid or folate . This was at a time when modern chromatography techniques were yet to be devel - oped , yet folic acid was successfully isolated by two independent groups using ingenious methods , including using activated char - coal to adsorb and concentrate folic acid and using a microbio - logical assay to rapidly detect its activity ( Hutchings et al . , 1941 ; Mitchell et al . , 1941 ) . These intense efforts culminated in 1948 , when E . L . Robert Stokstad and colleagues at Lederle Laboratories elucidated the chemical structure of folic acid by chemical degra - dation and total synthesis ( Stokstad and Jukes , 1987 ) . Having learned of the discovery of folic acid , Sidney Farber recruited a cohort of leukemic children to test whether folic acid might be able to restore normalcy to the blood cells in leukemia , just as it does in macrocytic anemia ( Farber et al . , 1947 ) . Although this trial was quickly stopped , as folic acid was found to actually exacerbate the disease , it led to a revised idea that folic acid an - tagonists might stop leukemia . This revised idea was borne out in Farber’s next trial . As described in his landmark paper in 1948 ( Farber and Diamond , 1948 ) , one of the tested folic acid antago - nists , aminopterin , produced temporary remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Thus , the era of cancer che - motherapy had begun . What also ensued was a “golden era” for enzymology in gen - eral ( 1950 – 1960 ; Huennekens , 1996 ) , during which many en - zymes involved in folate metabolism were purified from crude cell or tissue extracts and characterized , and their reactions merged into coherent pathways . Among these enzymes , dihy - drofolate reductase ( DHFR ) was identified as the major target of aminopterin and its more widely used close analogue , meth - otrexate ( Werkheiser , 1961 ; Huennekens , 1994 ) . In the following decades , rapid development of molecular biology techniques allowed cloning of the genes encoding the enzymes , and Robert Schimke discovered that amplification of the DHFR gene confers tumor resistance to methotrexate . Remarkably , this was the first known case of gene amplification in mammalian somatic cells ( Schimke , 1989 ) . Many excellent reviews on folate metabolism have appeared over the past decade , some of which cover metabolic compart - mentation ( Tibbetts and Appling , 2010 ; Scotti et al . , 2013 ) , folate transport ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , and the roles of folates in redox ho - meostasis ( Ducker and Rabinowitz , 2017 ) , embryonic develop - ment ( Momb and Appling , 2014 ) , cancers ( Locasale , 2013 ; Yang and Vousden , 2016 ) , and plants ( Hanson and Gregory , 2011 ) . It is sometimes claimed in the current literature that all the components in the metabolic pathways have been identified , and the challenge now is to understand how the metabolic fluxes are regulated . While we wholeheartedly agree with the latter point , we share with others the opinion that many components in mammalian folate metabolism remain to be identified , and their functions remain to be understood . Recently introduced disci - plines , such as comparative genomics ( Gabaldón and Koonin , 2013 ) , functional genomics ( Wang et al . , 2014 ; Shalem et al . , 2015 ; Horlbeck et al . , 2016 ) , and organelle proteomics ( Chapel et al . , 2013 ; Pagliarini and Rutter , 2013 ; Calvo et al . , 2016 ) , have opened up new opportunities for solving these remaining puzzles . Thus , in this review , we emphasize missing links and underdeveloped areas and discuss potential approaches to illuminate them . We Correspondence to Lewis C .

Zheng and Cantley Folate metabolism in health and disease Journal of Experimental Medicine https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1084 / jem . 20181965 254 begin with a survey of folate chemistry , an important aspect of folate metabolism that is sometimes overlooked . Structure and chemistry of folates Nomenclature By convention , “folates” is a generic term , referring to a large family of compounds consisting of a 2 - amino - 4 - hydroxy - pteri - dine ring , linked by a methylene ( CH 2 ) group to a p - aminoben - zoyl moiety , which is in turn linked through amide bond to the α - amino group of a monoglutamate or poly - γ - glutamate ( Fig . 1 A ; Blakley , 1987 ) . One - carbon ( 1C ) units can be attached to N5 , N10 , or both . On the other hand , the name “folic acid” is reserved for the synthetic form with the fully oxidized pteridine ring and no 1C substitution ( Fig . 1 B ) . The number of distinct molecular species within the folate family could be as many as 150 , due to the combinatorial effect of varying 1C and pteridine oxidation states and varying poly - glutamate chain lengths ( Krumdieck et al . , 1983 ) . Nevertheless , typically < 50 species are detectable in natural animal and plant sources ( Gregory , 1989 ) , with the pteridine ring predominantly in the most reduced , tetrahydro state ( Fig . 1 B ) , N5 and N10 either unsubstituted or substituted with one of six different 1C units ( Fig . 1 C ) , and the polyglutamate chain length being predomi - nantly five to eight ( Lin et al . , 1993 ) . Folates as 1C carriers or electron carriers In most folate - mediated reactions , tetrahydrofolate ( THF ) serves as a 1C carrier , which obtains the 1C unit from a donor ( e . g . , ser - ine ) and then transfers it to an acceptor , typically a biosynthetic intermediate . The attached 1C units exist in three different oxi - dation states that are equivalent to methanol , formaldehyde , and formate ( Fig . 1 C ) and can be interconverted by cellular enzymes using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADP ) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) as a cosubstrate . Although the pteridine ring in folates is capable of undergoing redox reactions , this capability is rarely used . A notable exception occurs in the thymidylate synthase – catalyzed reaction ( Fig . 1 B ) , in which the folate pteridine ring undergoes a two - electron oxi - dation . To sustain THF levels , therefore , DHFR is required to act downstream of thymidylate synthase to recycle DHF back to THF . Chemical lability of reduced folates Naturally occurring , reduced folates are chemically labile . In fact , the first identified folate , folic acid , was likely an artifact due to the lengthy isolation procedures , during which natural folates were largely decomposed by reacting with molecular oxygen , and a minor component among the oxidized products was folic acid ( Krumdieck et al . , 1983 ) . The chemical lability is an important as - pect of folates , not only presenting a technical challenge for their chemical analysis , but also reflecting their tendency to break down in vivo . Antioxidants , ascorbate in particular , are effective in minimizing folate decomposition and have proved useful in various analytical methods for folates ( Quinlivan et al . , 2006 ) . Different classes of folates , defined by the pteridine oxidation state and the 1C identity , display markedly different stabilities and follow distinct degradation pathways . We describe the path - ways for each class , roughly in the order of increased stability . THF . In the absence of antioxidants , the half - life of THF in aqueous solutions at 37°C is typically < 30 min ( Pollock and Kaufman , 1978 ) . The pathway of THF decomposition is mediated by quinoid DHF ( qDHF ) , generated via a free radical mechanism ( Fig . 2 A ) . qDHF is unstable and readily cleaves into 7 , 8 - dihydrop - terin , formaldehyde , and p - aminobenzoylglutamate ( pABG ; Reed and Archer , 1980 ; Burgos - Barragan et al . , 2017 ) . Formaldehyde is a potent cross - linker for proteins and nucleic acids ( Burgos - Barragan et al . , 2017 ) . 10 - Formyl - THF . In the absence of antioxidants , 10 - formyl - THF is readily oxidized to 10 - formyl - DHF ( half - life , typically < 30 min at 37°C ) , and on prolonged incubation , is further oxidized to 10 - formyl - folic acid ( Baggott et al . , 1995 ; Baggott , 2000 ) . 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF and 5 , 10 - CH + - THF . There appear to be few reports on the stability of 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF and 5 , 10 - CH + - THF , presumably because 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF is in equilibrium with THF and formal - dehyde ( Kallen , 1971 ) , and 5 , 10 - CH + - THF would hydrolyze to 10 - formyl - THF and , to a much lesser degree , 5 - formyl - THF at neutral pHs ( Stover and Schirch , 1993 ) . DHF . DHF is much more stable than THF , with a half - life of 4 . 5 h at 30°C , pH 7 . 0 ( Reed and Archer , 1980 ) . DHF can undergo either pteridine ring oxidation to folic acid or C9 - N10 cleavage to pABG and 6 - formyl - dihydropterin or dihydroxanthopterin ( Chippel and Scrimgeour , 1970 ; Reed and Archer , 1980 ) . The partition into these three pathways seems to depend on the pH and the type of buffer ( Chippel and Scrimgeour , 1970 ; Reed and Archer , 1980 ) . 5 - Methyl - THF . 5 - Methyl - THF can be readily oxidized to 5 - methyl - 5 , 6 - DHF . In the presence of thiols or ascorbate , 5 - meth - yl - 5 , 6 - DHF readily reverts to 5 - methyl - THF . Conversely , when subject to more oxidative conditions , 5 - methyl - 5 , 6 - DHF either rearranges to a 5 - methyl - dihydro - pyrazino - s - trazine compound or cleaves into an unidentified pterin and pABG ( Gregory , 1989 ) . Folic acid and 5 - formyl - THF . These two species are stable to ox - idation , except under harsh conditions such as in the presence of KMnO 4 ( Maruyama et al . , 1978 ) . Paradoxical stability of folates in vivo Given the intrinsic tendency of reduced folates to decompose , it is surprising that folates were found to be extremely slowly turned over in human whole body or in cultured mammalian cells ( Krumdieck et al . , 1978 ; von der Porten et al . , 1992 ; Lawrence et al . , 2014 ) . For example , using a 2 H - folic acid tracer , folate breakdown rates in adult humans were estimated to be ∼ 0 . 5 % per day ( half - life , ∼ 19 d ; von der Porten et al . , 1992 ) . This is in stark contrast to the situation in plants , where folate breakdown is very rapid , at a rate of ∼ 10 % per day ( Orsomando et al . , 2006 ) . A series of excellent reviews ( Linster et al . , 2013 ; Lerma - Ortiz et al . , 2016 ; Sun et al . , 2017 ) emphasized two important facets of metabolism that were largely overlooked in classic textbooks of biochemistry . First , enzymes are not always exquisitely specific and efficient , and many of them also catalyze unwanted side re - actions . Moreover , many metabolites are chemically labile and reactive , and thus prone to damage . To counter such metabolite damage , cells have often evolved dedicated metabolite repair en - zymes . In an example related to folate metabolism , 5 - formyl - THF , a dead - end metabolite formed from 5 , 10 - CH + - THF by a side reac - Zheng and Cantley Folate metabolism in health and disease Journal of Experimental Medicine https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1084 / jem . 20181965 255 Figure 1 .

( C ) The 1C unit is derived from donors such as serine , exists in three different oxidation states , and is used for various bio - chemical processes .

We recently found that cellular THF decomposition can be prevented by an enzyme , quinoid dihydropteridine reductase ( QDPR ) ; specifically , the qDHF intermediate of THF decomposi - tion can be reduced by QDPR back to THF at the expense of two reducing equivalents from NADH ( Fig . 2 B ; Zheng et al . , 2018 ) . Moreover , the oxidation product of 10 - formyl - THF , 10 - formyl - DHF , can be reduced back to 10 - formyl - THF by DHFR , or to THF by tandem actions of ATIC and DHFR ( Fig . 2 B ; Zheng et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , the oxidative damage to the two least stable fo - lates , THF and 10 - formyl - THF , can be enzymatically repaired in mammalian cells . It is likely that other factors also contribute to folate sta - bility in vivo . For example , folates can be stabilized through protein binding ( Wittwer and Wagner , 1981 ; Cook and Wagner , 1982 ; Min et al . , 1988 ; Jones and Nixon , 2002 ) . In addition , the reduced intracellular milieu maintained by glutathione - and thioredoxin - mediated systems may play an indispens - able role as well . Folate pathways : Identified and unidentified components Among the three processes we discuss in this section , folate up - take and catabolism typically occur on a much slower timescale than most 1C transfer reactions , consistent with the cell’s differ - ential needs for folate and 1C . Folate is needed only in catalytic amounts to function as a cofactor , whereas 1C must be rapidly transferred via heavy - traffic pathways to support demanding processes such as nucleotide synthesis . Folate uptake and intracellular accumulation Folate uptake at the cell surface . At the plasma membrane , two transmembrane carriers ( SLC19A1 and SLC46A1 ) and three gly - cosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored receptors ( FOLR1 – 3 ) can mediate folate uptake ( Fig . 3 A ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . The substrate of these transporters and receptors is folate monoglutamate , consistent with the fact that the circulating folate is predomi - nantly 5 - methyl - THF monoglutamate ( Ratanasthien et al . , 1974 ) . SLC19A1 , also known as the reduced folate carrier , is a widely ex - pressed antiporter that exchanges a reduced folate for another anion substrate . Candidates for the counter substrate of SLC19A1 , including thiamine phosphates and 5 - aminoimidazole - 4 - carbox - amide ribonucleotide monophosphate ( ZMP or AIC AR ) , have been suggested ( Visentin et al . , 2012 ) . ZMP is an intermediate Figure 2 . Folate decomposition and damage repair . ( A ) Chemical pathway of THF decomposition . ( B ) Cellular enzymatic systems for folate damage repair . Zheng and Cantley Folate metabolism in health and disease Journal of Experimental Medicine https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1084 / jem . 20181965 257 in purine biosynthesis and is known to accumulate in folate de - ficiency , in both bacteria ( Stetten and Fox , 1945 ; Bochner and Ames , 1982 ) and mammal cells ( Herbert et al . , 1964 ; McGeer et al . , 1965 ) . Therefore , using ZMP as a counter substrate for SLC19A1 would represent an elegant feedback mechanism for regulating intracellular folate homeostasis . SLC46A1 , also known as the proton - coupled folate transporter , is most active at acidic extracellular pHs . Consistent with its low pH optimum , SLC46A1 catalyzes symport of protons with the fo - late substrate , notably in the acidic , upper region of the small in - testine , where it is highly expressed . Loss - of - function mutations in SLC46A1 are the only known cause of the rare disease hered - itary folate malabsorption ( Qiu et al . , 2006 ; Zhao et al . , 2007 ) . The folate receptors , strongly expressed in certain epithelial tissues and some gynecological cancers , mediate folate uptake through an endocytic pathway , but the exact mechanism is a mat - ter of debate ( Paulos et al . , 2004 ; Chadda et al . , 2007 ) . Whatever the mechanism , to support cellular folate - dependent functions , the internalized folate monoglutamate must be effluxed from an internal vesicular compartment into the cytosol ( Fig . 3 A ) . It has been suggested that SLC46A1 could mediate this efflux ( Zhao et al . , 2009 ) , yet the same authors also pointed out that FOLR1 can function normally in some cells that lack SLC46A1 expres - sion , indicating that there is at least one alternative transporter ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . Folate uptake into the mitochondria . At the mitochondrial inner membrane , SLC25A32 , a member of the mitochondrial carrier family that consists of ∼ 50 proteins , imports reduced folate monoglutamates into the mitochondrial matrix ( Fig . 3 A ) . Surprisingly , however , human SLC25A32 cDNA was able to com - plement the growth defects of a yeast mutant lacking a homol - ogous gene , FLX1 , that encodes a putative mitochondrial flavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) transporter ( Spaan et al . , 2005 ) . Recently , compound heterozygous mutations in SLC25A32 were found in a patient with riboflavin - responsive exercise intoler - ance , further supporting a link between SLC25A32 and FAD metabolism ( Schiff et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , these studies have raised the question of whether mammalian SLC25A32 is a carrier for folate , FAD , or both . The virtual absence of mitochondrial folates in SLC25A32 mutant Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells strongly argues that folate is a bona fide substrate for SLC25A32 ( Titus and Moran , 2000 ; McCarthy et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast , FLX1 - deficient yeast still has sizable mitochondrial FAD ( Tzagoloff et al . , 1996 ) . More - over , mammalian mitochondria ( Barile et al . , 2000 ; Calvo et al . , 2016 ) , and possibly yeast mitochondria as well ( Bafunno et al . , 2004 ) , can synthesize FAD from riboflavin using riboflavin ki - nase and FAD synthetase , so it is not apparent why FAD needs to be imported from the cytosol . Given that the transport mecha - nism of SLC25A32 remains to be further delineated ( Lawrence et al . , 2011 ) , it is possible that SLC25A32 is an antiporter that cou - ples folate import with FAD export ( Fig . 3 A ) . Consistent with this possibility , yeast FLX1 has been suggested to be a mitochondrial FAD export carrier ( Bafunno et al . , 2004 ) . Cytosolic and mitochondrial folate retention by polyglutamation . Folate polyglutamation , catalyzed by folylpolyglutamate synthe - tase ( FPGS ) , plays an indispensable role for intracellular folate accumulation . In cells lacking FPGS , folate monoglutamates that have been taken up will readily efflux out of the cell , resulting in only ∼ 10 % of normal folate accumulation ( Osborne et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , polyglutamation adds multiple negative charges to the imported folates and thereby dramatically enhances their in - tracellular accumulation . Moreover , polyglutamation markedly increases the affinity of most folate - dependent enzymes for their folate substrate ( Matthews et al . , 1987 ) . DHF , THF , and 10 - formyl - THF are efficient substrates for FPGS , whereas 5 - methyl - THF , 5 - formyl - THF , and folic acid are poor substrates ( Cichowicz and Shane , 1987 ) . Because 5 - meth - yl - THF is the major circulating folate , its conversion by methi - onine synthase ( MTR ) to THF is thought to be the first metabolic step in cells that precedes polyglutamation ( Cook et al . , 1987 ) . FPGS is expressed in most tissues as at least two isoforms that result from alternative splicing and alternative translational start sites , one of which targets to the mitochondrial matrix ( Lawrence et al . , 2014 ) . This enables the establishment of distinct , nonmis - cible cytosolic and mitochondrial folate pools that operate in two parallel pathways , described next . Parallel cytosolic and mitochondrial 1C pathways Parallel 1C pathways exist in the cytosol and in mitochondria , re - spectively , each composed of a core set of serine hydroxymethyl - transferase , CH 2 - THF dehydrogenase / CH + - THF cyclohydrolase , and 10 - formyl - THF synthetase activities ( Fig . 3 B ; Shin et al . , 2014 ) . These two pathways are connected by small metabolites that can readily traverse the mitochondrial inner membrane , such as serine , glycine , and formate . The consensus for the in - terrelationship of the two pathways is that the mitochondrial 1C pathway produces formate , which in turn is used in the cytosolic pathway for purine , dTMP , and methionine biosynthesis , or ex - creted out of the cell if in excess ( Christensen and MacKenzie , 2006 ; Tibbetts and Appling , 2010 ; Meiser et al . , 2016 ; Ducker and Rabinowitz , 2017 ) . Recently , SFXN1 has been identified as a mitochondrial ser - ine transporter ( Kory et al . , 2018 ) . SLC25A38 has been suggested to be a mitochondrial glycine transporter ( Fernández - Murray et al . , 2016 ; Lunetti et al . , 2016 ) . However , the genes encoding mitochondrial transporters for formate , sarcosine , and dimeth - ylglycine remain unknown ( Fig . 3 A ) . Another well - recognized role for the mitochondrial 1C path - way is glycine synthesis ( Titus and Moran , 2000 ; Christensen and MacKenzie , 2006 ; Tibbetts and Appling , 2010 ; Jain et al . , 2012 ; Ducker and Rabinowitz , 2017 ) . A long - standing question is why the cytosolic SHMT1 cannot produce sufficient glycine . To generate glycine continuously via SHMT1 , THF has to be contin - uously regenerated . For the cytosolic 1C pathway operating in the direction of glycine synthesis , THF regeneration is impeded by the unfavorable NADP / NAD PH and ADP / ATP ratios in the cytosol ( Veech et al . , 1979 ; Christensen and MacKenzie , 2006 ) . Our recent work showed that overexpression of ALDH1L1 can overcome this thermodynamic barrier by bypassing the unfavorable 10 - formyl - THF synthetase step , thereby allowing continuous THF regen - eration and glycine synthesis in the cytosol ( Zheng et al . , 2018 ) . The mitochondrial 1C pathway also supports mitochon - drion - specific functions . It is well known that mitochondrial Zheng and Cantley Folate metabolism in health and disease Journal of Experimental Medicine https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1084 / jem . 20181965 258 Figure 3 . Folate transport and metabolic compartmentation . ( A ) Knowledge gaps in cellular folate metabolism . ( B ) Parallel cytosolic and mitochondrial folate pathways . Zheng and Cantley Folate metabolism in health and disease Journal of Experimental Medicine https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1084 / jem . 20181965 259 10 - formyl - THF is used for N - formylation of the initiator methi - onine in mitochondrial methionyl - tRNA Met . Loss - of - function mutations in the human formyltransferase gene , MTF MT , have been causally linked to Leigh syndrome , a mitochondrial dis - ease ( Tucker et al . , 2011 ) . Unexpectedly , a recent study showed that SHMT2 - knockout HCT116 cells contained normal levels of formylmethionine in mitochondrially translated peptides ( Morscher et al . , 2018 ) . In contrast , another recent study found severe depletion of mitochondrial formyl - methionyl - tRNA Met in SHMT2 - knockout Jurkat cells ( Minton et al . , 2018 ) . It remains to be clarified whether these discrepancies can be accounted for by the differences in the cell line context , and if so , what the con - text - specific modulators are . Recent research is also beginning to reveal a surprising role for mitochondrial 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF in mitochondrial protein trans - lation . These studies , first performed on prokaryotic systems , highlight the synergy between genetic , structural , and biochem - ical approaches . It was first established , through genetics , that two bacterial proteins , MnmE and MnmG , are involved in modi - fying uridine at the wobble position of certain bacterial transfer RNAs ( tRNAs ) to 5 - methyluridine derivatives ( Elseviers et al . , 1984 ; Hagervall et al . , 1987 ) , yet the biochemical understanding was lagging behind . A breakthrough came when x - ray crystallography revealed that MnmE contains a folate - binding fold strikingly resem - bling that in several known folate - binding enzymes ( Scrima et al . , 2005 ; Scrutton and Leys , 2005 ) . This revelation enabled the long - awaited in vitro reconstitution experiments , in which vari - ous THF derivatives were tested ( together with other known cos - ubstrates ) for the ability to stimulate the reaction of the MnmE / MnmG complex with tRNAs ( Moukadiri et al . , 2009 ; Armengod et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF was found to be active and was suggested to be an essential cofactor for MnmE / MnmG . The human orthologues of MnmE and MnmG , GTP BP3 and MTO1 , have been predicted to be responsible for the occurrence of 5 - taurinomethyluridine at the wobble position in certain mi - tochondrial tRNAs ( Suzuki et al . , 2011 ; Suzuki and Suzuki , 2014 ) . To date , successful in vitro reconstitution for this putative activ - ity has not been published . However , compelling genetic evidence has been provided by a recent study : knocking out either MTO1 or SHMT2 ( which supplies mitochondrial 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF ) in HCT116 cells resulted in no detectable levels of 5 - taurinomethyluridine in mitochondrial tRNAs ( Morscher et al . , 2018 ) . Consistent with the crucial role of this wobble uridine modification in stabiliz - ing codon – anticodon pairing , these knockout cells were defec - tive in mitochondrial protein translation ( Morscher et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , the mitochondrial folate pathway provides the 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF substrate for GTP BP3 / MTO1 - mediated mitochondrial tRNA modification in human cells , an important finding with rele - vance to the mitochondrial disorders myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke - like episodes , which are caused by defective 5 - taurinomethyluridine modification ( Suzuki et al . , 2011 ; Suzuki and Suzuki , 2014 ) . Our understanding of mitochondrial folate metabolism is not yet complete , however . Like MnmE , another bacterial protein YgfZ contains a folate - binding fold in its crystal structure , and its folate - binding activity was confirmed by biophysical experi - ments ( Teplyakov et al . , 2004 ) . YgfZ homologues ( named IBA57 for the human gene ) occur in all domains of life and , through a poorly understood mechanism , are essential for the assem - bly or maintenance of certain iron - sulfur proteins in bacteria ( Waller et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) and in yeast ( Gelling et al . , 2008 ) and human ( Sheftel et al . , 2012 ) mitochondria ( Fig . 3 A ) . At least in bacteria , the function of YgfZ in iron - sulfur cluster metabolism is folate dependent ( Waller et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) . Further inves - tigation into IBA57 is much needed to fully decipher the mito - chondrial respiration defects caused by impaired mitochondrial folate metabolism . Folate catabolism Folate catabolism is extremely slow under normal conditions , but can be greatly accelerated with methotrexate treatment ( Zheng et al . , 2018 ) . The bulk of folate catabolism in vivo is accounted for by the appearance of p - acetamidobenzoylglutamate ( pAcABG ) and pterins , products of folate C9 - N10 bond cleavage , in urine ( Murphy et al . , 1976 ; Krumdieck et al . , 1978 ) . Whereas the C9 - N10 bond cleavage is probably spontaneous , reflecting folate in - trinsic instability , formation of pAcABG from the direct cleavage product pABG requires an enzyme , the NAT1 acetyltransferase ( Minchin , 1995 ; Wakefield et al . , 2007 ) . The cellular pathways for folate catabolism are poorly un - derstood . Because plasma membrane efflux is prohibited for polyglutamated folates , pABG , or pAcABG , conversion of folate polyglutamate into folate monoglutamate , or deglutamation , is required for cellular clearance of folate catabolites . The only known enzyme capable of folate deglutamation is γ - glutamyl - hy - drolase ( GGH ) , which is either contained within lysosomes or se - creted into the extracellular space ( Hugonnet , 2012 ) . Consistent with the role of GGH in folate deglutamation , GGH up - regulation was associated with a shift in intracellular folate distribution to shorter polyglutamate species in a hepatoma cell line ( Yao et al . , 1995 ) . To access GGH , polyglutamated folates , pABG , or pAcABG have to be imported into the lysosome . A lysosomal carrier spe - cific for polyglutamated rather than monoglutamated metho - trexate was reported in the 1990s ( Barrueco et al . , 1992 ; Sirotnak and Tolner , 1999 ) , but many questions remain unanswered , such as its gene identity and whether it preferentially imports cleaved folates ( Fig . 3 A ) . The acidic pH ( ∼ 4 . 5 ) of lysosomal lumen is ex - pected to precipitate some spontaneous reactions of folates , such as the conversion of 5 , 10 - CH + - THF to 5 - formyl - THF ( Baggott , 2000 ) . Finally , it remains to be determined whether the mono - glutamate product of GGH is directly secreted via lysosomal exo - cytosis ( Settembre et al . , 2013 ) or first released into the cytosol via a lysosomal carrier . Approaches to identify missing components Historically , many components involved in folate metabolism were discovered by biochemical purification to chase down the protein responsible for an activity of interest ( Tan et al . , 1977 ; Huennekens , 1996 ) and by forward genetic screens followed by cDNA complementation ( Dixon et al . , 1994 ; Titus and Moran , 2000 ) . The use of radioactive folic acid tracer in rats also greatly accelerated the discoveries of folate transporters / receptors and Zheng and Cantley Folate metabolism in health and disease Journal of Experimental Medicine https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1084 / jem . 20181965 260 folate - binding enzymes for which folate was not an expected substrate but later proved to be an integral component of their catalysis ( Wagner , 1982 ; Garcia et al . , 2016 ) . More recently , searching for paralogs in the then just - completed human genome database allowed identification of missing genes for known ac - tivities ( Prasannan et al . , 2003 ; Bolusani et al . , 2011 ) . It is possible that saturation has not been reached in tradi - tional forward genetic screens where chemical - induced mu - tagenesis could have target bias . Moreover , in some cases , the causal gene remains elusive . For example , glycine auxotrophic mutants of CHO cells discovered in the 1970s ( Chasin et al . , 1974 ; McBurney and Whitmore , 1974 ) fall into four complementation groups : GLYA ( = SHMT2 ) , GLYB ( = SLC25A32 ) , AUXB1 ( = FPGS ) , and GLYC / AUXB2 . Although the growth defect of the GLYC mu - tant was complemented by human DHFR2 ( also named DHF RL1 ) cDNA ( Anderson et al . , 2011 ) , the DHFR2 gene does not exist in the rodent from which the CHO line was derived . Thus , the GLYC / AUXB2 gene remains to be identified , for example by RNA or whole - exome sequencing . The radioactive folic acid tracer approach had been limited to folate binders that are highly abundant and show high affinity ( dissociation constant = submicromolar or lower ) toward its fo - late ligand ( Min et al . , 1988 ) . The same limitations would be en - countered if a folate affinity column ( Wittwer and Wagner , 1980 ) were used to pull down potential binders ( Burdine and Kodadek , 2004 ) . Although protein abundance is less an issue with the advent of highly sensitive mass spectrometry instruments , the requirement for tight binding remains a hurdle . Thus , new pro - teomic approaches such as thermal proteome profiling ( Martinez Molina et al . , 2013 ; Franken et al . , 2015 ) and limited proteolysis – small molecule mapping ( Piazza et al . , 2018 ) , developed to cap - ture both strong and weak protein – ligand interactions in cells , can be powerfully complementary . If an activity is known to localize to an intracellular organelle ( e . g . , lysosomes or mitochondria ) , then the search for the gene can be dramatically narrowed down to dozens or fewer candi - dates by referring to published inventories of genes encoding proteins for that organelle ( Chapel et al . , 2013 ; Pagliarini and Rutter , 2013 ; Calvo et al . , 2016 ) . A caveat is that these invento - ries have incomplete coverage and finite false discovery rates ( Pagliarini and Rutter , 2013 ) , and moreover , for the lysosome , it might be difficult to distinguish resident proteins from cargo proteins delivered there for degradation ( Chapel et al . , 2013 ) . Nevertheless , recent success stories , such as the discoveries of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier ( Bricker et al . , 2012 ; Herzig et al . , 2012 ) and the mitochondrial calcium uniporter ( Baughman et al . , 2011 ) , highlight the excellent potential for this approach . The above organelle proteomics – based approach correlates an activity with a list of proteins on the basis of subcellular colocal - ization . Yet there are other ways to infer correlations . For exam - ple , genes with unknown functions can be linked to genes with well - defined functions on the basis of coevolution , coexpression , protein – protein interactions , suppression and synthetic interac - tions , and for microbial orthologues of a candidate human gene , gene clustering and gene fusion ( https : / / string - db . org / and https : / / thebiogrid . org / ; Pagliarini and Rutter , 2013 ; Niehaus et al . , 2015 ) . To further understand the function of a gene of inter - est , one may zero in on short stretches of protein - encoding or promoter sequences and correlate the protein or DNA sequences with well - defined protein kinase phosphorylation or transcrip - tion factor binding motifs , as detailed in previous reviews ( Frame and Cohen , 2001 ; Manning and Cantley , 2007 ) and exemplified by some recent studies ( Ben - Sahra et al . , 2013 , 2016 ; Ye et al . , 2014 ; DeNicola et al . , 2015 ; Lee et al . , 2017 ) . Ultimately , the hypotheses thus generated need to be tested using genetic , biochemical , and pharmacological approaches . Interaction of the folate cycle with the methionine cycle ATP , NAD , and NADP are universal cofactors in metabolism . Therefore , folate pathways are connected to almost every other metabolic pathway through shared ATP , NAD , and NADP pools . Although folate pathways can contribute to the production of NAD PH and ATP , their fluxes are also directly affected by com - partment - specific ATP / ADP , NAD / NADH , and NAD PH / NADP ratios . Recently it has been proposed that NAD PH produced by ALDH1L2 in the mitochondrial 1C pathway is important to limit mitochondrial ROS ( Piskounova et al . , 2015 ; Yang and Vousden , 2016 ) . Here , we further discuss the methionine cycle , which is linked to folate cycle via a more “specialized” metabolite , 5 - methyl - THF ( Fig . 4 ) . The link between folate and methionine cycles has long been recognized , since a deficiency in either folate or vitamin B12 ( an essential cofactor for MTR ) produces megaloblastic ane - mias that are hematologically indistinguishable ( Shane and Stokstad , 1985 ) . The megaloblastic anemia in both cases is as - cribed to defective DNA synthesis and can be reversed by large doses of folates . Thus , vitamin B12 deficiency causes functional folate deficiency , and this is best explained by the methyl trap model ( Shane and Stokstad , 1985 ) . Methylenetetrahydrofolate Figure 4 . The folate cycle is linked to the methionine cycle via MTH FR and vitamin B12 – using MTR . Zheng and Cantley Folate metabolism in health and disease Journal of Experimental Medicine https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1084 / jem . 20181965 261 reductase ( MTH FR ) – catalyzed conversion of 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF to 5 - methyl - THF is irreversible in cells , due to the large negative standard free - energy change and high cytosolic NAD PH / NADP ratios ( Matthews and Drummond , 1990 ) . In addition , methionine synthase is the only enzyme that can remove the methyl group from 5 - methyl - THF . Thus , a lack of vitamin B12 and thus MTR activity would irreversibly trap folates into 5 - methyl - THF , at the expense of 5 , 10 - CH 2 - THF and 10 - formyl - THF , both of which are crucial to DNA synthesis . The original methyl trap model has been expanded to include two subsequent developments . First , MTH FR is allosterically inhibited by S - adenosyl - methionine ( SAM ) with an inhibition constant of 2 . 8 µM ( Shane and Stokstad , 1985 ) . Thus , large doses of methionine can increase intracellular SAM , block the methyl trap , and thereby ameliorate both folate and B12 - deficient mega - loblastic anemia . Second , as discussed above , the MTR - catalyzed conversion of 5 - methyl - THF to THF is likely the first folate met - abolic step in cells that precedes polyglutamation , so vitamin B12 deficiency would also compromise intracellular folate polyglu - tamation and retention . This explains the clinically observed , diminished total cellular folate content in vitamin B12 deficiency . It is currently unresolved to what extent the folate cycle con - tributes to cellular methylations in normal physiology and dis - eases such as cancers . MTH FR - knockout mice are viable , and some clinical symptoms of human MTH FR deficiency may be ascribed to hyperhomocysteinemia rather than alterations in methylation ( Schwahn et al . , 2003 ) . Many cultured cell lines are unable to proliferate when the medium methionine is replaced with homocysteine ( Borrego et al . , 2016 ; Lien et al . , 2017 ) , and indeed stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry analysis indicated that for many cell lines , the contribution of serine and folate pathways to the active methyl group is insignificant com - pared with medium methionine ( Pike et al . , 2010 ; Shyh - Chang et al . , 2013 ; Ducker et al . , 2016 ; Maddocks et al . , 2016 ) . Under - standing the mechanistic bases for such methionine dependency in cancer cell lines should be an important future direction , es - pecially in light of the recent discoveries that many oncogenic mutations directly impact DNA and histone methyltransferases and demethylases ( Garraway and Lander , 2013 ) . Functions of folate metabolism and disease connections The biochemical outputs of folate metabolism include nucleotide synthesis , serine - glycine interconversion , mitochondrial tRNA modification , and methyl group biogenesis , which in turn sup - ports cellular functions such as proliferation , mitochondrial res - piration , and epigenetic regulation . Abnormal folate metabolism has been causally linked with a myriad of diseases . However , for each disease , it is often unclear which biochemical processes and cellular functions are culprits . The earliest known folate - related disease is probably meg - aloblastic anemia . Systemic folate deficiency , whether dietary , alcohol or drug induced , or due to germline mutations in DHFR or SLC46A1 ( Qiu et al . , 2006 ; Banka et al . , 2011 ; Cario et al . , 2011 ) , invariably results in megaloblastic anemia . The molecular basis for megaloblastic anemia has been ascribed to deranged DNA synthesis , which results in chromosome breakage , and contin - ued cell growth without division during red blood cell production ( Shane and Stokstad , 1985 ) . In some other cell types , folate defi - ciency can cause uracil misincorporation into DNA , leading to chromosome breakage ( Blount et al . , 1997 ) . It has been proposed that such breaks could contribute to the increased risk of cancer ( Blount et al . , 1997 ) . Cerebral folate deficiency , caused by folate receptor autoan - tibodies or germline mutations in FOLR1 or SLC46A1 , is mani - fested in neurological impairments and shows some resemblance to severe MTH FR deficiency ( Watkins and Rosenblatt , 2014 ) . Thus , folate metabolism plays a crucial , yet poorly defined , role in the brain . Insufficient folate intake around and during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of neural tube defects , which is the basis for the mandatory folate fortification of foods in the US since 1998 ( Momb and Appling , 2014 ) . Strong evidence for the role of the mitochondrial folate pathway in neural tube develop - ment has been provided by a MTH FD1L - knockout mouse model , which presents neural tube defects with 100 % penetrance while on a folate - proficient diet ( Momb et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , mice deficient in the AMT or GLDC gene , encoding a subunit of the glycine cleavage system , also developed neural tube defects with partial penetrance ( Narisawa et al . , 2012 ; Pai et al . , 2015 ) . It was further shown with the MTH FD1L or GLDC - knockout mice that supplementation with formate rescued the neural tube defects ( Momb et al . , 2013 ; Pai et al . , 2015 ) . In a recent study , further deletion of MTH FR in GLDC - null mouse embryos resulted in significant protection from neural tube defects , suggesting that folate and formate - supported nucleotide synthesis , rather than MTH FR - mediated methyl group biogenesis , is crucial for neural tube development ( Leung et al . , 2017 ) . Conversely , excess folate intake may enhance proliferation of malignant tumors ( Strickland et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , genes encoding enzymes in serine biosynthesis and the mitochondrial folate pathway are often amplified or overexpressed in can - cers ( Locasale et al . , 2011 ; Possemato et al . , 2011 ; Nilsson et al . , 2014 ) . It has been suggested that metabolic activities under on - cogenic control in cancers can be categorized based on whether they are transforming , enabling , or neutral ( Vander Heiden and DeBerardinis , 2017 ) . As attested by the successes of methotrexate and other antifolates in treating cancers , it is likely that serine biosynthesis and mitochondrial folate metabolism belong to the first two categories , and therefore are potential therapeutic tar - gets ( Mullarky et al . , 2016 ; Pacold et al . , 2016 ; Ducker et al . , 2017 ) . On the other hand , restriction of dietary serine and glycine has been proposed to treat cancers that lack up - regulation of de novo serine biosynthesis ( Maddocks et al . , 2017 ) . Future perspectives Throughout this review , we have highlighted areas that await further development and discussed how to explore them using existing technologies . Yet it is hard to predict where upcoming technologies will lead us . From a biochemical perspective , we en - vision a future where the entire human proteome is structurally solved ( Petsko , 2014 ) and the folate binding fold ( Scrutton and Leys , 2005 ) might be revealed in many more proteins , thus push - ing forward a new level of understanding of folate metabolism in human health and disease .
