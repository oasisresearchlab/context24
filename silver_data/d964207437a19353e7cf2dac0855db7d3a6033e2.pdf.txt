Gaston Biodiversity and Macroecology Group , Department of Animal and Plant Sciences , University of ShefŽeld , Alfred Denny Building , Western Bank , ShefŽeld S10 2TN , UK Although it is widely thought to in(cid:143)uence ecosystem processes , there is little consensus on an appropriate measure of functional diversity . The two major perspectives , to date , are to assume that every species is functionally unique , or to assume that some species are functionally identical , such that functional groups exist . Using a continuous measure of functional diversity ( FD ) derived from the quantitative functional traits of species , we show that the loss of functional diversity from six natural assemblages was rapid compared with rates of loss from comparable simulated assemblages . Loss of FD occurred faster than loss of functional - group diversity in four of the six natural assemblages . Patterns of functional - group diversity loss depended on the number of functional groups and the number of species in an assemblage . Extinctions that occurred Žrst for species with particular traits ( e . g . low leaf nitrogen concentration , deep roots and large body size ) caused greater loss of FD than expected by chance in four of the six natural assemblages . In two real assemblages , these trait - dependent extinctions had more severe effects on FD than our simulated worst - case extinction scenario . These data suggest that conserving a large proportion of the functional traits of species requires conserving a large proportion of all species . Keywords : species richness ; functional - group diversity ; redundancy ; trait - dependent extinction 1 . INTRODUCTION There is growing evidence of links between functional diversity and ecosystem processes ( Chapin et al . 2000 ; Daily 1997 ; D õ ´az & Cabido 2001 ; Grime 2001 ; Huston 1997 ; Loreau et al . 2001 ; Tilman 2000 , 2001 ) . However , the possible effects of species extinctions on functional diversity remain constrained by the limited methods avail - able for quantifying functional diversity . Either all species are considered to be functionally unique so that extinc - tions always reduce functional diversity ( Ehrlich & Ehrlich 1983 ) , or some species are considered to be functionally identical , such that functional groups can be identiŽed . Within functional groups , such redundancy makes species richness irrelevant ; all that matters is that the biomass within functional groups is maintained ( Lawton & Brown 1993 ) . Reality doubtless lies somewhere between these two extremes ( Fonseca & Ganade 2001 ; Walker 1995 ) ; some species are more similar than others at coarse func - tional scales and all species differ at Žner functional scales . Here , we explore the impact of extinctions on functional diversity using both a recently developed continuous mea - sure of functional diversity ( FD ) and functional - group diversity ( Tilman 2001 ) . The latter obviously requires that species are assigned to functional groups and , hence , an arbitrary decision about the scale at which differences between species are functionally insigniŽcant ( Fonseca & Ganade 2001 ; Hector et al . 1999 ; Hooper 1998 ; Naeem & Li 1997 ; Rastetter et al . 1999 ; Simberloff & Dayan 1991 ; Tilman et al . 2001 ; Vitousek & Hooper 1993 ) . By con - trast , FD does not require grouping and includes the large functional differences that might delineate functional groups , as well as smaller differences that would be ignored by assigning species to functional groups . * Author for correspondence ( o . petchey @ shef . ac . uk ) .

Three particular comparisons highlight our results : ( i ) effects of randomly ordered extinctions from real assemblages of species compared with random extinctions from simulated assemblages ; ( ii ) effects of extinction on FD compared with functional - group diversity ; and ( iii ) effects of random extinctions from real assemblages compared with trait - dependent extinctions from real assemblages . Trait - dependent extinctions occurred when species with high or low values for a trait , such as body size or photosynthetic rate , suffered simulated extinction Žrst . 2 . METHODS Calculating FD begins by measuring functionally important traits of species . In the six case studies that we selected from the primary literature , the authors used their expert biological knowledge to select these traits . They ranged from ecophysiolog - ical properties ( e . g . leaf N , P uptake ; Chapin et al . 1996 ) , to prey consumed ( e . g . percentage of all the prey consumed by a species ; Mun˜oz & Ojeda 1997 ) , to feeding behaviour ( e . g . per - centage of total time spent feeding ; Holmes et al . 1979 ) . The latter two types of trait should be particularly closely linked to ecosystem functioning because they concern resource use directly , which is important for ecosystem functioning ( Loreau 1998 ) . Ecophysiological traits , mostly used in plant studies , were the focus of the original studies because they determine many ecological processes with clear ecosystem - level conse - quences ( e . g . Hobbie 1995 ) . Three of the case study assem - blages were of plants ( Chapin et al . 1996 ; D õ ´az & Cabido 1997 ; Golluscio & Sala 1993 ) and three were of animals ( Holmes et al . 1979 ; Jaksic´ & Medel 1990 ; Mun˜oz & Ojeda 1997 ) . All rel - evant details of these assemblages are available in the original literature sources , including complete species lists . 1722 O . L . Petchey and K . J . Gaston Extinctions and functional diversity The s species by t traits matrix containing this information was transformed into an s by s distance matrix . This contains the distances between species in t - dimensional trait space . Hier - archical clustering of the distance matrix resulted in the func - tional dendrogram of which FD is the total branch length ( PD , an accepted measure of phylogenetic diversity , is the total branch length of the evolutionary tree ; Faith 1992 ; May 1990 ) . This dendrogram is often used in assigning species to functional groups ( Chapin et al . 1996 ; D õ ´az & Cabido 1997 ; Ko¨rner 1993 ; Lavorel et al . 1997 ) and guilds ( Hawkins & MacMahon 1989 ; Simberloff & Dayan 1991 ; Terborgh & Robinson 1986 ) . Extinc - tions result in the pruning of branches from the functional den - drogram , loss of the unique functional characters associated with those branches and decreased FD . For this paper , all traits were standardized to mean = 0 and variance = 1 , distances were Eucli - dean and the clustering algorithm was the unweighted pair - group method using arithmetic averages ( UPGMA ) . All simula - tions and analyses were performed in R ( http : / / www . r - project . org ) . We used the functional - group memberships reported in each of the case studies to examine how extinctions reduced func - tional - group diversity . Although some of the real assemblages were originally analysed for guild structure , there may be little distinction between functional groups and guilds ( Allison et al . 1996 ; Simberloff & Dayan 1991 ; Vitousek & Hooper 1993 ) . Four extinction scenarios that differed in the order in which species extinctions occurred were simulated : ( i ) when species go extinct in random order ( i . e . Želd of bullets ; Raup 1991 ) ; ( ii ) when species go extinct in the order that minimizes the losses of FD caused by each extinction ; ( iii ) when species go extinct in the order that maximizes the losses of FD caused by each extinction ; and ( iv ) a trait - dependent order of species extinc - tions . Trait - dependent extinctions simulated the expected effects of nitrogen deposition in plant assemblages , and the loss of larger bodied species Žrst in the animal studies . Nitrogen deposition can alleviate the stresses that favour large slow grow - ing plant species in nutrient - poor environments , such as tundra , resulting in the loss of these slower growing species , dominance of faster growing species and reduced species richness ( Chapin et al . 1995 ; Nilsson et al . 2002 ; Press et al . 1998 ; Theodose & Bowman 1997 ; Turkington et al . 1998 ; but see Jonasson 1992 ) . Hence , trait - dependent extinctions in the plant assemblages were in the order of increasing leaf nitrogen concentration ( Chapin et al . 1996 ) ( the photosynthetic rate measurements were incomplete and also strongly correlated with leaf nitrogen ; r 2 = 0 . 81 ) or rooting depth ( Golluscio & Sala 1993 ) ( because photosynthetic rate or a strongly correlated trait was unavailable ) . Extinctions from D õ ´az and Cabido’s ( 1997 ) assem - blage occurred Žrst for larger species , although the matrix con - tained only ordinal trait values , with eight size classes of plant . The order of extinctions within these size classes was random . The extinction risk for animals can be correlated with body size , with larger bodied species suffering greater risk ( Gaston & Blackburn 1995 ; Lawton 1995 ) . Consequently , trait - dependent extinctions in the animal assemblages occurred in the order of decreasing body size . The body masses presented in Holmes et al . ( 1979 ) and Mun ˜ oz & Ojeda ( 1997 ) were used . Body masses for the assemblage studied by Jaksic´ & Medel ( 1990 ) were taken from Dunning ( 1993 ) ( birds ; mean of male and female mass ) , Wilson & Ruff ( 1999 ) ( carnivores ) , and for snakes we converted total length ( from the Colorado Herpetological Society web site , http : / / www . coloherp . org ) to mass using the allometric relation - ship in Pough ( 1980 ) . Proc . R . Soc . Lond . B ( 2002 ) We compared the effects of extinctions in real assemblages with the effects in simulated assemblages . One way to simulate the structure of the functional dendrogram is to vary the corre - lation structure of the trait matrix by altering the number of uncorrelated traits t by which s species differ . This effectively changes the dimensionality of the trait space that species occupy . Many uncorrelated traits ( e . g . t = 10 , s = 20 ) result in species that separate in high - dimensional trait space and allow all spe - cies to differ equally ( all species can be equidistant in trait space ; low redundancy ) . Few or no uncorrelated traits ( e . g . t = 0 , s = 20 ) result in species that separate in low - dimensional trait space and cause some species to be more similar than others ( some species are closer in trait space ; higher redundancy ) . We kept the total number of traits ( correlated and uncorrelated ) constant ( T = 10 ) and varied the number of uncorrelated traits t = 0 , t = 1 or t = 10 . All trait values were normal [ 0 , 1 ] . The other method that we used to simulate the functional dendrogram was to make species clump in trait space . For simplicity , we clumped species ( s = 20 ) along a single trait axis by assuming there were a number f of normal distributions of trait values along that axis , each with mean x i . That is , the trait values of species i were normal [ x i , 1 ] ; x i took a limited number of values f that deŽnes the number of functional clumps of species along the trait axis . 3 . RESULTS Randomly ordered species extinctions caused remark - ably similar and rapid loss of FD among the six real assemblages ( Žgure 1 ) compared with the initially slow losses that occurred in low - dimensional ( few uncorrelated traits ) simulated assemblages ( Žgure 2 ) . Low - dimensional trait space resulted in initially small losses of FD that accelerated as the number of species remaining in the assemblage decreased ; such an effect is characteristic of assemblages that are functionally redundant . This redun - dancy occurs because species differ in their contribution to FD ( redundancy can also result from differences in spe - cies’ abundances and distributions ) , and it was more extreme in simulated assemblages with strong clumping of species in trait space ( Žgure 2 c ) . Here , initial extinctions had very little effect on FD because very similar species remained . Loss of all members of a clump of species , how - ever , reduced FD greatly . Loss of FD in the real assem - blages was more similar to the high - dimensional simulated assemblages where loss of FD was proportional to loss of species ( i . e . the linear pattern in Žgure 2 a ) . The order of extinctions was important in both real and simulated assemblages : loss of species that minimized sequential losses of FD caused a small initial but accelerating loss of FD ( apparent redundancy in species’ contributions to FD ) . Maximizing stepwise losses of FD sometimes caused relatively large initial and decelerating loss of FD ( a keystone - like pattern ; Sala et al . 1996 ) . The rate of loss of FD from real assemblages as a result of random species losses was rapid compared with the loss of functional group diversity in four of the real assem - blages ( Žgure 1 a , d , e , f ) , although the losses were more similar in the other two ( Žgure 1 b , c ) . The difference or similarity between loss of FD and functional group diver - sity was associated with the average number of species per functional group and the evenness of the distribution of species among the functional groups .

Trait - dependent orders of species extinctions reduced FD to levels signiŽcantly ( trajectories outside the 95 % conŽdence interval ) below those caused by randomly ordered species extinctions in four of the six natural assemblages ( Žgure 3 a , d , e , f ) . These lower than expected levels of FD occurred over differing ranges of species loss : for insectivorous birds , ca . 50 – 80 % loss , arctic vegetation , ca . 50 – 100 % , Patagonian forbs , ca . 10 – 75 % , and Argen - tinean (cid:143)ora , ca . 20 – 60 % and 70 – 80 % loss . Hence , although maximum ( all species remaining ) and minimum ( one species remaining ) FD were identical for any assem - blage ( Žgure 3 ) , there was little consistency in the range of species loss for which trait - dependent extinctions reduced FD below random levels . An especially severe reduction of FD occurred during trait - dependent extinc - tions in the assemblages of arctic vegetation and Argen - tinean (cid:143)ora . Here , FD dropped below the level of our worst - case extinction scenario , in which species were selected to maximize stepwise loss of FD ( Žgure 3 d , f ) . This also happened in some of the simulated assemblages ( Žgure 2 b , c ) . Proc . R . Soc . Lond . B ( 2002 ) 4 . DISCUSSION A recent study suggested that extinctions may have little effect on functional diversity—a loss of 75 % of species results in no loss of functional group diversity ( Fonseca & Ganade 2001 ) . Measuring the continuum of functional differences among species , from very large to very small , allows measurement of the contribution of every species to functional diversity . Such a measure ( FD ) applied to real assemblages of species shows rapid loss of functional diversity compared with both possible losses from simu - lated assemblages and loss of functional group diversity . The real assemblages showed little evidence of the redun - dancy of species’ contributions to functional diversity that can occur in simulated assemblages . These results suggest that the functional traits of species are distributed such that species are relatively unique . Any complacency regarding the effects of extinction on the loss of functional diversity would be misplaced . Small initial effects of extinctions on functional group diversity is an almost inevitable consequence of assuming that the species within these groups are functionally ident - ical , so loss of a species may have no effect ( Fonseca & Ganade 2001 ) . The more species in the functional groups , the greater the apparent redundancy of species’ contri - butions to functional diversity in the assemblage . Unfortu - nately , there is no objective way by which to decide how many species should be in how many functional groups ( Simberloff & Dayan 1991 ) . Even when the functional 1724 O . L .

So the effects of species extinctions on functional group diversity are subjective underestimates of the effect of extinctions on functional diversity . Why might there be little evidence of redundancy in species’ contributions to functional diversity ( FD ) in the six real assemblages ? These and unpublished analyses show that the number of uncorrelated functional traits is important—more traits result in more rapid initial loss of functional diversity . Between 6 and 27 traits were meas - ured in the real assemblages , providing the potential for separation of species in high - dimensional trait space . Strongly correlated traits would , however , reduce the effective dimensionality of niche space , so that measuring many traits alone is not sufŽcient to create rapid effects of extinction . These results suggest that real species separ - ate in trait space with sufŽcient dimensions for rapid loss of functional diversity . In thinking about the effects of extinctions on this diversity , we need to pay careful atten - tion to the frequency with which sets of traits occur in combination rather than the representation of individual traits . For evaluating the effects of extinction on FD , a critical Proc . R . Soc . Lond . B ( 2002 ) question is which traits should be measured . Other authors have concluded that the measured traits should be those for which evidence exists of their functional importance ( Chapin et al . 1996 ; D õ ´az & Cabido 1997 ; Leishman & Westoby 1992 ) . This usually requires that a particular function is speciŽed in advance , as is required to assign species to functional groups . For example , relative growth rate of a plant is probably important for primary production . Missing functionally signiŽcant traits from measures of FD will result in an underestimate of the effects of extinction on redundancy of species’ contri - butions to functional diversity . This cautions that any empirical evidence of this redundancy will be overly optimistic . It is easy to imagine that the number of such traits increases with the number of ecosystem functions con - sidered to be important . Hence , measures of FD relevant to many aspects of ecosystem functioning may require high - dimensional trait space . This suggests the hypothesis that the functional diversity that is important for complete ecosystem functioning will be reduced by any number of extinctions . That is , there can be little redundancy of spec - ies’ contributions to functional diversity in species assem - blages unless one restricts the number of ecosystem processes that are considered important .

Effects of trait - dependent extinctions on FD in the six real assemblages ( arranged as in Žgure 1 ) . Solid lines show the mean and 95 % conŽdence intervals of 100 random extinction trajectories . Open circles show the trait - dependent extinction trajectory . Filled circles show the trajectories of maximum or minimum stepwise loss of FD . In ( f ) , points were plotted for one and even numbers of species only . The arrows in ( d ) and ( f ) show where trait - dependent extinctions reduced FD below a worst - case extinction scenario in which species loss maximized stepwise reductions of FD . The order by which species disappear from an assem - blage can alter importantly the rate of functional diversity loss in these real assemblages . When extinctions occurred in the order that minimized and maximized sequential losses of FD , there were redundant or keystone - like pat - terns of FD loss ( Sala et al . 1996 ) within each assemblage , i . e . the effects of extinction will differ depending on whether a species that contributes greatly or not to diver - sity is lost . This differs from the observation that the order of species extinctions will be important when more or less abundant species suffer extinction Žrst ( Sala et al . 1996 ) . Consequently , at least two hypotheses exist for how the order of species extinctions in(cid:143)uences the loss of ecosys - tem functioning : interspeciŽc differences in contributions to functional diversity and interspeciŽc differences in abundance . The relative importance of these potential processes remains unclear . Simulated trait - dependent extinction of species caused greater than random loss of functional diversity in four of the six assemblages . This mirrors the greater than random loss of phylogenetic diversity that can occur when extinc - tions are aggregated within particular taxa ( Heard & Mooers 2000 ; Purvis et al . 2000 ; Von Euler 2001 ) . Assuming random loss of species can produce conserva - tive estimates of the rate of loss of both functional and phylogenetic diversity . We based the order of extinctions in the plant assemblages on the expected effects of nitro - gen deposition , but did not assume a speciŽc cause for the extinctions in the animal assemblages . Further studies of how other speciŽc causes of extinction ( e . g . habitat destruction , fragmentation and invasions ) bias extinctions towards species with particular functional traits will help predict how particular types of disturbance will affect functional diversity . It is especially worrying that trait - dependent extinctions Proc . R . Soc . Lond . B ( 2002 ) in the assemblage of arctic vegetation and Argentinean (cid:143)ora caused reductions of functional diversity that , with low numbers of species remaining , were more severe than our worst - case extinction scenario . In both cases , the tra - jectory of extinctions that maximized sequential loss of FD did not include the assemblage with minimum FD . This occurred because our worst - case scenario minimized the loss of FD caused by each extinction , as opposed to searching for the least diverse set of species at each diver - sity level . Hence , the initial extinctions ( within any parti - cular extinction trajectory ) constrained the effects of subsequent extinctions such that a ‘you can’t get there from here’ phenomenon occurred . It became impossible to reach the species set with minimum FD through loss of a single species ( multiple species replacements / substitutions were required ) . Other simulations suggest this phenomenon may not be uncommon in natural assemblages . Thus , not only may the trait - dependent pat - terns of species extinctions that are presently occurring result in unduly rapid loss of functional diversity , but they also have the potential to reduce this diversity faster than almost any other extinction scenario .
