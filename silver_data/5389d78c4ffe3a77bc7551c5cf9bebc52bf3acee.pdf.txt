In vitro studies have shown that VSMCs are sensitive to substrate stiffness , but the exact molecular mechanisms of their response to stiffness remains unknown . Studies have also shown that cell - cell interactions can affect mechanotransduction at the cell - substrate inter - face . Using ﬂexible substrates , we show that the expression of proteins associated with cell - matrix adhesion and cytoskeletal tension is regulated by substrate stiffness , and that an increase in cell density selectively attenuates some of these effects . We also show that cell - cell interactions exert a strong effect on cell morphology in a substrate - stiffness dependent manner . Collectively , the data suggest that as VSMCs form cell - cell contacts , substrate stiffness becomes a less potent regulator of focal adhesion signaling . This study provides insight into the mechanisms by which VSMCs respond to the mechanical environment of the blood vessel wall , and point to cell - cell interactions as critical mediators of VSMC response to vascular injury . INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease , which includes atherosclerosis and restenosis , is the leading cause of death in the United States ( 1 ) . Efforts to elucidate the mechanisms of cardiovascular disease have revealed several consistent themes : Phenotypic changes in resident vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) , which include enhanced proliferation , migration , and re - modeling of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , are hallmarks of neointimal expansion in atherosclerotic and restenotic blood vessels . Atherosclerotic lesion growth is also accom - panied by vessel wall stiffening , which is itself predictive of disease progression ( 2 – 4 ) . A growing body of work demon - strates that VSMCs are sensitive not only to the biochemical but also the mechanical properties of the ECM , and respond to changes in stiffness with systematic modiﬁcations in phenotype ( 5 – 14 ) . Thus , it is likely that altered ECM mechanics in a diseased artery play a role in the response to injury exhibited by synthetic VSMCs , potentially contrib - uting to both healing and disease progression . Mechanotransduction is the process by which cells sense and respond to physical stimuli from the environment , and numerous studies point to focal adhesions ( FAs ) and adhe - rens junctions ( AJs ) as the principal sites of mechanical signaling in cell - ECM and cell - cell interactions , respec - tively ( 15 – 18 ) . In both cases , heterogeneous protein clusters form a structural link between an external anchor and the actin cytoskeleton and participate in numerous inside - out and outside - in signaling pathways . Importantly , FA and AJ dynamics can be regulated by applied force ( 19 – 21 ) , and there is evidence that mechanotransduction through the two types of contacts is interdependent . For example , endo - thelial cell morphology is dependent on substrate stiffness in sparse but not conﬂuent cultures ( 22 ) , whereas varying levels of cadherin expression can directly modulate cell - substrate adhesion ( 23 ) . These and similar ﬁndings ( 24 , 25 ) show that cells integrate biochemical and / or mechanical signals from FAs and AJs and modify the degree of each to achieve a particular phenotype . Within an atherosclerotic lesion , VSMCs experience changes in cell - cell interactions along with mechanical and biochemical signaling . To understand the role of matrix stiff - ening in VSMC pathology , it is also essential to understand how communication through cell - cell junctions may affect cellular response to ECM mechanics . In this study , we quan - tiﬁed changes in VSMC spreading and FA and cytoskeletal protein expression as a function of substrate stiffness and cell density . Our results indicate that cell - cell interactions selectively modulate certain effects of substrate stiffness , suggesting a mechanism by which VSMCs may balance physical stimuli from cell - cell and cell - ECM contacts . This process may be critical to regulating VSMC response to local injury , driving it toward a state of repair or chronic pathology . MATERIALS AND METHODS Substrate synthesis and characterization Polyacrylamide ( PAAM ) gelsubstrateswere synthesizedand functionalized with ﬁbronectin ( Fn ) using a modiﬁcation of previous methods ( 26 , 27 ) . Substrate mechanics were determined with tensile testing and nanoindenta - tion using an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) . For tensile testing , Hooke’s law was used to determine the bulk elastic modulus for 2 (cid:1) 3 inch gel samples . Nanoindentation was used to characterize the mechanics of thin gels ( 100 m m ) on glass coverslips , where the surface elastic modulus of each sample was calculated using a linearized variant of the Hertz model Submitted March 3 , 2011 , and accepted for publication June 21 , 2011 . * Correspondence : jywong @ bu . edu or mnugent @ bu . edu Editor : Denis Wirtz .

Control experiments veriﬁed that Fn incorporation does not affect PAAM elastic modulus ( data not shown ) . An enzyme - linked immunosor - bent assay ( ELISA ) was used to quantify the relative ﬁbronectin concentra - tion in PAAM gels . Control experiments showed that this assay is sensitive to protein content only at the gel surface : gels of uniform volume but increasing surface area produced a higher antibody signal , whereas gels of varyingvolumebutuniformsurfaceareadidnot ( datanotshown ) . Addition - ally , we found that the efﬁciency of Fn incorporation varied inversely with acrylamide concentration . To produce substrates with increasing elastic modulus but identical Fn surface concentration , we adjusted the amount of protein added to each gel solution . Detailed methods for substrate synthesis and characterization can be found in the Supporting Material . Cell culture Primary rat neonatal aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured on tissue culture polystyrene in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids , sodium pyruvate ( Mediatech , Manassas , VA ) , and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Atlanta Biologicals , Lawrenceville , GA ) . First or second passage cells were detached with a solution of 0 . 05 % trypsin and 0 . 02 % EDTA , centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 (cid:1) g , and plated on PAAM gels at 5 , 000 or 12 , 000 cells / cm 2 in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum that had been depleted of soluble Fn using a gelatin - sepharose column ( 29 ) . Media was changed 24 h after seeding , and again every 48 h . Cells were ﬁxed after 48 h for immunostaining , whereas samples for protein or gene expression were collected after 96 – 120 h . Cell density quantiﬁcation We used a combination of phase - contrast microscopy and computational image analysis ( written in MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) ) to quantify live cell density on PAAM gels 3 – 6 h before collecting samples for gene and protein expression studies . We averaged the computed conﬂu - ence of 10 – 15 images from a given sample to obtain an average conﬂuence measurement for that sample . Samples with 40 – 60 % cell coverage were deﬁned as low density and 80 – 95 % cell coverage as high density . Refer to Methods and Fig . S1 in the Supporting Material for details . Cell area quantiﬁcation Cells on PAAM substrates were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , permeabi - lized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 in TBS , and stained with Hoescht and rhodamine - phalloidin at a 1 : 400 dilution . Samples were sandwiched between two coverslips and imaged at 10 (cid:1) using an Olympus IX81 micro - scope ( Olympus America , Center Valley , PA ) , a Hamamatsu ORCA R2 camera ( Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) , and Metamorph Imaging software ( Universal Imaging , Downingtown PA ) under appropriate ﬂuorescent illu - mination . Cell area as a function of cluster size was determined by measuring cluster area and dividing by the number of nuclei to obtain average individual cell area ( see Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Refer to Methods in the Supporting Material for details . Western blotting The following antibodies were used to assess protein expression ( raised in mouse and obtained from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO ) unless otherwise noted ) : Primary anti - a - actin ( clone 1A4 ) , anti - a - tubulin ( clone DM - 1A ) , antitalin ( clone 8d4 ) , antivinculin ( clone hVin - 1 ) . We used an HP - linked goat antimouse secondary antibody ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) in all exper - iments . Gels were rinsed 3 times with ice cold phosphate buffered saline before lysis . To ensure that samples were only collected from PAAM , and not the underlying glass surface , we removed the entire gel from the coverslip before submerging it in lysis buffer . After a 30 min incubation period , gels were separated from the lysate by centrifugation through a 35 m m ﬁlter column ( USB , Cleveland , OH ) at 2000 (cid:1) g for 2 min . After more centrifugation ( 10 , 000 (cid:1) g for 10 min at 4 (cid:3) C ) , we collected the supernatant and determined the total protein concentration ( BCA Protein Assay , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Electrophoresis and immunoblotting pro - ceeded according to standard protocol ( see Supporting Material ) . Gene expression PAAM gels were removed from their coverslips and submerged in guanidi - nium thiocyanate ( 4 M ) for 15 min . After being separated from the gels , lysates were processed according to standard protocol for RNA isolation ( see Supporting Material ) . RNA ( 500 – 1000 ng ) from each sample was treated with DNase to remove any remaining genomic DNA . cDNA was synthesized in a reverse transcriptase ( RT ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) reaction using the TaqMan EZ RT - PCR kit ( Applied Biosystems , Carlsbad , CA ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Real - time PCR was performed ( ABI 7300 ; Applied Biosystems ) using the following primers ( Applied Biosystems ) : syndecan - 4 ( Rn00561900 ) , b 1 integrin ( Mn01253227 ) , and 18S rRNA ( 4308329 . ) Data were analyzed using the DD Ct method , where signal intensity was normalized to the corresponding signal for 18S rRNA expression . The resulting quantities were used to calculate an expression average for each condition relative to the 25 kPa ( soft ) substrate . Focal adhesion and adherens junction analysis VSMCs were cultured on 25 and 135 kPa substrates for 48 h in Fn - depleted medium . Samples were rinsed in ice - cold phosphate buffered saline and incubated with prepermeabilization buffer ( 50 mM NaCl , 30 mM sucrose , 10 mM PIPES , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 m g / ml protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , 0 . 05 % Triton - X 100 , pH 6 . 8 ) for 1 min on ice . Samples were then ﬁxed and stained using an antivinculin or anti - p120 catenin ( clone 15D2 , Millipore ) antibody , and imaged using confocal microscopy . Select images were processed using custom MATLAB software that identiﬁes objects in the image based on criteria of threshold , object size ( 0 . 3 – 20 . 0 m m 2 ) , and elongation ( 0 . 7 – 1 . 0 , where 0 indicates a perfect circle ) . Objects meeting these criteria were analyzed to quantify their number and size . Additional methods for sample preparation , confocal microscopy , and image analysis can be found in the Supporting Material . Statistics Statistical signiﬁcance was established with ANOVA followed by the Mann - Whitney U test , or linear regression analysis ; p - values < 0 . 05 were considered signiﬁcant . RESULTS To model the effect of blood vessel wall stiffening on vascular smooth muscle cell behavior , we used PAAM gel substrates with tunable mechanical properties to match the range of stiffness documented in healthy and diseased vessels ( 30 ) . Modifying the acrylamide / bis ratio produced substrates whose elastic modulus increased linearly with bis - acrylamide concentration ( Fig . 1 ) . Uniaxial tensile testing of the gel bulk and nanoindentation of the gel surface with AFM ( Fig . 1 A ) produced elastic moduli spanning 21 – 136 kPa . Values obtained with Hooke’s law ( tensile testing ) and the Linearized Hertz model ( nanoindentation ) were in Biophysical Journal 101 ( 3 ) 622 – 630 VSMC Density versus Substrate Stiffness 623 excellent agreement with one another . For simplicity , the three substrates used in this study , produced using acryl - amide / bis ratios of 10 % : 0 . 1 % , 10 % : 0 . 4 % , and 12 % : 0 . 6 % , will be referred to as having moduli of 25 , 70 , and 135 kPa , respectively . To promote cell adhesion , we cova - lently incorporated Fn throughout the bulk of the gel and quantiﬁed Fn concentration with an ELISA that was sensi - tive to protein at the gel surface ( veriﬁed with control exper - iments ) . Efﬁciency of Fn incorporation proved dependent on substrate stiffness : varying Fn concentration in gel solutions produced substrates with different moduli but similar Fn surface concentrations ( Fig . 1 B ) . Cultured VSMCs showed robust spreading and comparable levels of attachment and proliferation on all substrates ( Fig . 1 C ) . To investigate how cell - cell contacts affect VSMC response to substrate stiffness , we cultured cells at two different densities before assaying gene and protein expres - sion . Cell density was quantiﬁed with a series of phase - contrast images taken 3 – 6 h before lysis ( Fig . S1 A ) ; these were analyzed with custom MATLAB software to compute average cell density ( Fig . S1 B ) . Wewere also able to monitor the variance in cell density on each sample ( Fig . S1 C ) . To determine whether stiffness and cell density might exert competing effects on cell spreading , we quantiﬁed cell area as a function of cell cluster size ( Fig . 2 ) on 25 and 135 kPa substrates . We found that single cells , paired cells , and cells in triplicate on 135 kPa substrates are ~ 1 . 5 times larger than those on 25 kPa substrates ( p < 0 . 05 ) . As cell cluster size increased from 4 to 7 cells , however , average cell area on 135 kPa substrates began to decrease until it was indistinguishable from average cell area for comparable clusters on 25 kPa substrates . A linear regres - sion ﬁt to average cell area on 135 kPa substrates showed a statistically signiﬁcant negative correlation between cell area and increasing cluster size ( r 2 ¼ 0 . 84 , slope ¼ (cid:4) 0 . 07 , p < 0 . 05 ) , whereas there was no correlation for cells on 25 kPa substrates . To conﬁrm the link between cell density and cadherin - based cell - cell contacts on 25 and 135 kPa substrates , we examined the organization of p120 catenin in clusters of increasing size ( Fig . 3 ) . We observed a clear increase in AJ formation with increasing cell density : single cells did not exhibit any notable catenin organization , whereas clus - tered cells showed increasing levels of punctate adhesions at the interface of contact ( white arrows ) . We saw no differ - ence in this trend with substrate stiffness . To better understand how substrate mechanics and cell - cell contacts affect cell interaction with the ECM , we exam - ined the effect of substrate stiffness and cell density on the expression of b 1 integrin and syndecan - 4 mRNA . At low FIGURE 2 Cell density modulates cell spreading on stiff but not soft substrates . ( A and B ) VSMC area as a function of cluster size was quantiﬁed using immunocytochemistry and ﬂuorescent image analysis . ( C ) For each sample set , cell area was normalized by the average 25 kPa single cell area to produce a normalized plot of average cell area as a function of cell cluster size . Data are the product of four biological replicates , with each cluster represented by one data point on the y axis ( n ¼ 5 – 200 ) . For this and all ﬁgures , asterisks ( * ) indicate statistically signiﬁcant differences between 135 and 25 kPa gels for a particular cell density , with p < 0 . 05 . FIGURE 1 Polyacrylamide substrates with varying mechanical proper - ties and uniform ﬁbronectin presentation support VSMC growth . ( A ) PAAM mechanics were assessed with tensile testing and nanoindentation using AFM . Varying acrylamide and bis concentration from 10 % to 12 % and 0 . 1 % to 0 . 6 % , respectively , produces substrates with elastic moduli of ~ 25 , 70 , and 135 kPa . Values represent averages of three separate exper - iments , n ¼ 15 – 25 indentations and 2 – 5 tensile measurements . ( B ) Covalent functionalization with ﬁbronectin produces gels with uniform ligand density . Gel surface levels of ﬁbronectin were measured by ELISA on three separate gels for each condition ; error bars in this and all ﬁgures represent standard error .

We then asked whether the increase in integrin expression would correlate with changes in FA protein expression . Looking ﬁrst at talin , a scaffolding protein that links b 1 integrin to polymerized actin ( 31 ) , we found that an increase in substrate stiffness produced a 1 . 5 - fold increase in talin protein expression ( p < 0 . 05 ) , but only at low cell density ( Fig . 5 , top row ) . Similarly , vinculin , a well - studied marker of FAs that directly interacts with talin ( 31 ) , was upregulated nearly twofold from 25 to 135 kPa ( p < 0 . 05 ) at low but not high cell density . We also examined the expression of the cytoskeletal proteins smooth muscle a - actin ( SMC a - actin ) and a - tubulin ( Fig . 5 , bottom row ) . Unlike the expression proﬁles of FA elements , we found that SMC a - actin and a - tubulin were upregulated with increasing stiffness at both low and high cell density . As substrate stiffness increased from 25 to 135 kPa , SMC a - actin protein expression increased 1 . 5 - fold ( p < 0 . 05 ) and 1 . 3 - fold ( p ¼ 0 . 063 ) in low and high density cultures , respectively , while a - tubulin exhibited a 2 . 0 - and 1 . 9 - fold increase ( p < 0 . 05 ) . We hypothesized that changes in cell area may explain the increase in FA protein expression on stiffer substrates . Confocal imaging of FAs stained for vinculin revealed that cell area had no effect on the individual FA area ( see Fig . 6 D ) , whereas increasing substrate stiffness from 25 to 135 kPa produced a small increase in the individual FA area ( see Fig . 6 E , 25 . 3 to 27 . 0 m m 2 , p < 0 . 05 ) . In contrast , cell area exerted a strong effect on the FA number on both soft and stiff substrates ( see Fig . 6 F ) . The FA number increased FIGURE 3 Increasing cell density leads to more AJs on soft and stiff substrates . VSMCs were cultured on 25 kPa ( left column ) and 135 kPa ( right column ) substrates for 48 h , then stained for p120 catenin and the cell nucleus . Confocal imaging demonstrates that single cells show negli - gible AJ formation , whereas cells in clusters exhibit higher levels of AJ formation ( white arrows ) as cluster size increases ( descending rows ) . FIGURE 4 Fibronectin receptor mRNA expression is a function of substrate stiffness only at low cell density . VSMCs were seeded onto 25 , 70 , and 135 kPa polyacrylamide substrates , maintained in 10 % FBS depleted of Fn , and lysed for mRNA extraction after 96 – 120 h in culture . Each value represents an average of 2 – 7 biological replicates , with each sample assayed 2 – 3 times with qPCR . Biophysical Journal 101 ( 3 ) 622 – 630 VSMC Density versus Substrate Stiffness 625 linearly with cell area , ranging from 40 to 210 per cell on soft substrates and 50 to 250 per cell on stiff substrates . DISCUSSION Tissue elasticity is a highly regulated determinant of normal tissue development and function . Using micro - and nano - scale precision , several recent studies have documented progressive extracellular matrix stiffening in a number of diseases including cancer , cirrhosis , pulmonary ﬁbrosis , and vascular disease ( 30 , 32 – 34 ) . In particular , local calciﬁ - cation and remodeling of the ECM in a developing vascular lesion can lead to loss of compliance in the vessel wall . The role of tissue stiffening in disease development and progres - sion , as well as the mechanisms by which mechanical infor - mation is transduced to alter vascular cell response , remain to be determined . Like cell - ECM contacts , cell - cell interactions are highly dynamic sites of chemical and mechanical stimuli that govern multiple phenomena , including cell sorting , wound healing , and tissue reorganization ( 35 , 36 ) . Recent studies show that cells are capable of exerting tension on each other through AJs and that AJ dynamics are tension dependent ( 19 , 15 , 37 ) . Given the similarities between FA and AJ struc - ture and function , it is likely that mechanisms of force sensing through cell - cell and cell - ECM adhesions are conserved and exhibit some degree of interdependence . Studies have shown that , individually , cell - cell interac - tions and substrate mechanics are potent regulators of cell morphology ( 8 , 38 – 41 ) . We studied the combined effects of these stimuli on VSMC response to stiffness using ﬂex - ible substrates and variable cell density . Although we did not directly control AJ formation , we showed that increasing cell density is closely correlated with higher levels of p120 catenin organization . This ﬁnding is consistent with other studies showing that cadherin expression and AJ stability increases with density in multiple cell types ( 42 – 44 ) , conﬁrming that varying cell density is an appropriate model for studying the effect of cadherin - based cell - cell interactions ( 45 , 46 ) . We report a mutual dependence between substrate stiff - ness and cell - cell interactions in the regulation of VSMC spreading area : On 135 kPa substrates , the stiffness - medi - ated increase in VSMC spread area disappeared with increasing cell cluster size , whereas cluster size had no effect on VSMC spreading on 25 kPa substrates . The ﬁrst result indicates that cell - cell interactions can override the effect of substrate rigidity on VSMC spreading . Because rigidity sensing is dependent on cytoskeletal tension , this effect could be due to mechanical cues from cell - cell contacts dominating over those coming from the substrate . It is also possible that the effect is largely biochemical ; FAs and AJs share a number of structural elements including vinculin and a - actinin , as well as signaling molecules such as the Rho - family GTPases ( 47 , 48 ) . Thus , the inverse relationship between cell area and cluster size may be a consequence of shifting signaling pathways or the fact that a ﬁnite pool of resources must now be shared between the two types of adhesion complexes . However , the second ﬁnding suggests that a certain level of tension at cell - ECM FIGURE 5 Focal adhesion but not cytoskeletal protein expression is a function of cell density . VSMCs were cultured on PAAM substrates at low ( 40 – 60 % conﬂuence ) and high ( 80 – 95 % conﬂuence ) density for 72 – 96 h in 10 % Fn - depleted FBS and lysed for Western blot analysis . Data were obtained with digital quantiﬁcation of protein expression in ImageJ . Values represent the average of 3 – 14 biological replicates , with 3 – 4 Western blots performed per sample . Biophysical Journal 101 ( 3 ) 622 – 630 626 Sazonova et al . adhesions is necessary for cell - cell contacts to exert their inﬂuence . If so , then this effect is not purely biochemical ; whereas chemical reactions readily occur in solution , the application of force requires a physical anchor . It is possible that a 25 kPa substrate does not provide enough resistance at FAs for the cell to form mechanically active AJs . This hypothesis is consistent with two recent studies demon - strating the dependence of AJ mechanics on forces gener - ated through integrin - ECM bonds ( 19 , 50 ) . Our ﬁndings are partially corroborated by a study of cell - cell and cell - matrix adhesion in endothelial cells ( ECs ) ( 51 ) , which revealed that increasing cell density reduces EC area and FA formation by a mechanism that involves vascular endothelial cadherin engagement . Here , we show that this relationship is not unique to ECs or to vascular endothelial cadherin - based contacts . Additionally , the authors showed that inhibition of the ROCK pathway eliminated these effects , implicating cytoskeletal tension as an important variable in cell - cell signaling . This ﬁnding suggests that a microenvironment capable of regulating the level of intra - cellular tension would also inﬂuence the effect of cell - cell contacts on cell morphology and FA formation . Our study is consistent with this hypothesis , demonstrating that a certain threshold of ECM rigidity is necessary for cell - cell contacts to affect VSMC area . These results provide further evidence that mechanotransduction through cadherin - based contacts is subject to the properties of the extracellular microenvironment in vivo , where VSMCs and ECs are likely to encounter changes in ECM rigidity . b 1 integrin , talin , and vinculin have previously been investigated in the context of mechanotransduction , where the function of each protein has been shown to be directly modulated by force ( 52 – 54 ) . The ﬁbronectin receptors b 1 integrin and syndecan - 4 establish initial adhesion between the cell and the ECM ( 55 ) , whereas talin and vinculin are recruited to the adhesion to reinforce integrin binding and form a structural link between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton ( 56 , 57 ) . In this study , substrate stiffness and cell density exerted similar effects on the expression of all FA proteins ( b 1 integrin , syndecan - 4 , talin , vinculin ) : at low cell density , expression increased with stiffness , whereas at high density , stiffness did not have an effect . Notably , we observed a striking similarity in the mRNA expression proﬁles of b 1 integrin and syndecan - 4 . Although b 1 integrin is strongly implicated as a mechanosensor in the literature ( 32 , 52 , 58 ) , far less is known about the role of mechanics in regulating syndecan - 4 expression and function ( 59 , 60 ) . Our data indicate that both substrate stiff - ness and cell density can regulate syndecan - 4 expression in concert with b 1 integrin . Given a potential role of syndecan - 4 in the development of vascular disease ( 61 – 64 ) , our ﬁndings call for further investigation into the effect of tissue mechanics on the expression and function of this receptor . We found that single cell size closely correlates with the FA number , with larger cells consistently forming more FAs than smaller cells , regardless of substrate stiffness . In effect , this resulted in a greater number of FAs formed on stiff substrates , as those cells tended to be nearly 1 . 5 times larger than cells on soft substrates . Interestingly , this increase in cell area is similar in magnitude to the stiffness - induced upregulation in gene and protein expression seen at low cell density . It thus seems likely that the observed changes in expression reﬂect greater cell spreading and enhanced FA formation as a result of increasing stiffness . We were not able to directly measure the effect of cell density on FA formation due to imaging artifacts created by the particular morphology of VSMC clusters . However , it has been shown that clustered ECs form fewer and smaller FAs than single cells ( 51 ) . Given that clustering reduces cell area and elimi - nates FA upregulation on stiff substrates , we propose that , like ECs , clustered VSMCs exhibit a reduction in FA assembly as a result of increasing cell - cell interactions . Although present methods cannot quantify individual FAs within VSMC cell clusters , we expect that clustered VSMCs on 135 kPa substrates would form fewer FAs than single FIGURE 6 Vinculin localization to FAs is regulated by cell area and substrate stiffness . VSMCs were cultured on 25 and 135 kPa substrates for 48 h in 10 % Fn - depleted FBS , prepermeabilized and ﬁxed , then stained for vinculin , the cell nucleus , and f - actin ﬁbers . ( A – C ) FAs were quantiﬁed with custom MATLAB software . ( D ) Individual FA size plotted against cell size on 25 and 135 kPa substrates .

Biophysical Journal 101 ( 3 ) 622 – 630 VSMC Density versus Substrate Stiffness 627 cells , whereas clustered and individual cells on 25 kPa substrates would be indistinguishable in this measure . One interpretation of the results presented is that VSMCs in dense clusters are less sensitive to substrate stiffness than single cells , perhaps because cell - cell contacts provide a louder mechanical stimulus than what is perceived through cell - ECM contacts . To the contrary , we found that SMC a - actin and a - tubulin show a stiffness – mediated increase in expression at both low and high cell density . This result clearly shows that cells retain the ability to sense and respond to ECM mechanics regardless of cell density . Furthermore , it indicates that mechanotransduction in VSMCs does not require a particular degree of spreading or FA expression , because cells in dense cultures exhibit the same cell area and FA protein expression on 25 and 135 kPa substrates , yet show a clear stiffness - mediated increase in cytoskeletal protein expression . Similarities between stiffness - and growth factor ( GF ) - induced cellular processes suggest that progressive stiff - ening of the vascular wall may contribute to VSMC pathology in a manner analogous to GF stimulation : VSMCs migrate faster and proliferate more rapidly when cultured on stiffer substrates ( 7 – 9 ) or in the presence of ﬁbroblast growth factor and platelet - derived growth factor ( 65 , 66 ) . Similarly , durotaxis , the tendency of cells to migrate up a stiffness gradient , can be accurately characterized using chemotaxis models ( 10 ) . The phenotypic plasticity of VSMCs is highly sensitive to GF exposure ( 67 ) , and abnormal GF levels at the site of vascular lesions have long been implicated in the pathological maintenance of the synthetic phenotype ( 68 – 70 ) . Interestingly , cell density has been shown to regulate the response of cells to GF stimulation ( 71 – 73 ) . In the current study , higher substrate stiffness led to enhanced cell - substrate interactions that may support higher levels of migration and proliferation , but increasing cell density attenuated this affect . Our data suggest that , in the course of normal healing , increasing cell density in the lesion could lessen certain effects of stiffness and / or GF exposure , allowing the cell to revert to a more quiescent , contractile state . The continuation of VSMC pathology may partially be due to the inability of cells to reestablish adequate AJs ; there is evidence that cadherin expression contributes to the stability of athero - sclerotic plaques ( 74 ) , whereas GF exposure has been shown to increase cell - substrate interactions in correlation with the disruption of cell - cell adhesions ( 24 ) . Thus , simultaneous GF signaling and a stiffened ECM may perpetuate vascular pathology by reducing the ability of synthetic VSMCs to reestablish cell - cell contacts . CONCLUSION Using morphological and biochemical analyses , this study revealed that substrate stiffness induces changes in VSMC morphology and gene and protein expression , but many of these effects are eliminated by increasing cell density . The vast majority of research on mechanotransduction has focused on the behavior of single or sparsely cultured cells ; our study brings to light the signiﬁcant and tightly regulated inﬂuence of cell - cell contacts on VSMC response to substrate mechanics , demonstrating that communication through AJs can mute the effect of substrate mechanics on FA function without fully eliminating VSMC rigidity sensing . Given the likely role of tissue mechanics in the progression of atherosclerosis , our ﬁndings provide further insight into the mechanisms by which the microenvironment of the developing lesion can inﬂuence VSMC behavior , and point to cell - cell contacts as critical mediators of VSMC response to vascular injury .
