New insights have resulted including a gene expression signature for invasive cells and the tumor microen - vironment invasion model . This model proposes that tumor invasion and metastasis can be studied as a problem resembling normal mor - phogenesis . We discuss how these new insights may lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis of the invasive behavior of tu - mor cells in vivo , which may result in new strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of metastasis . 695 A nnu .

Spreading of tumor cells relies upon cell motility , which results in the invasion of neighboring connective tissue and entry into lymphatics and blood vessels ( intravasation ) ( Clark et al . 2000 , Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Woodhouse et al . 1997 ) . We focus on tumor invasion and metastasis as a problem in cell motility . In this context , the motility behavior of tumor cells inside the tumor must be ana - lyzed as carefully as the gene expression pat - terns displayed by invasive cancer cells . Dur - ingmotility , themicroenvironmentbecomesa determinant in the success or failure of a can - cer cell in its attempt to traverse the tumor and enter blood and lymphatic vessels ( Liotta & Kohn 2001 ) . Subtle changes in the can - cer cell’s interactions with extracellular ma - trix and gradients of growth factors and cy - tokines deﬁne whether a cell becomes invasive or remains stationary in the tumor mass . Only by understanding the basic biology of how the motility of cells inside the tumor is inﬂu - enced by , and inﬂuences , the gene expression patterns of cancer cells and their microenvi - ronment will it be possible to deﬁne strate - gies to impede the spread of cancer cells from tumors . In this review three questions are consid - ered : What motility behaviors contribute to invasion and intravasation ? Is there an expres - sion signature that correlates with these be - haviors , thatis , aninvasionsignature ? Howdo the genes of the invasion signature contribute toinvasion ? Answeringthesequestionstodate has suggested a novel model for tumor inva - sion and metastasis , which is discussed at the end of the review . WHAT MOTILITY BEHAVIORS CONTRIBUTE TO INVASION AND INTRAVASATION ? Intravital Imaging of Tumor Cell Behavior in Tumors In Vivo An attempt to understand the behavior of tumor cells at single - cell resolution in vivo predates the introduction of green ﬂuores - cent protein ( GFP ) and its derivatives . Tumor cells were transiently labeled with vital dyes and observed with conventional transmitted and ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Chambers et al . 1995 , Scherbarth & Orr 1997 , Suzuki et al . 1996 , Vajkoczy et al . 1999 , Wood 1958 , Yuan et al . 1995 ) . This required the use of short - lived preparations in thin regions of tissue where light could pass efﬁciently and some - times the use of viewing windows ( Chambers et al . 1995 , Wood 1958 ) . These approaches 696 Condeelis · Singer · Segall A nnu . R e v . C e ll . D e v . B i o l . 2005 . 21 : 695 - 718 .

ANRV255 - CB21 - 28 ARI 8 September 2005 17 : 16 usually limited the analysis of tumors to artiﬁ - cial locations and introduced the potential for artifact resulting from the viewing method . A major step was the introduction of stable GFP expression , which allowed genetic label - ing of cells in tumors with tissue - and cell - type speciﬁcity without rejection of the GFP - tagged cells ( Chishima et al . 1997 , Farina et al . 1998 ) . Thus more clinically relevant tumor models were developed that could be imaged in the location in the animal where the tu - mor naturally forms and progresses to differ - ent stages ( Ahmed et al . 2002 , Brown et al . 2001 , Yang et al . 2000 ) . The introduction of the laser - scanning confocal microscope was an essential advance that made optical sectioning and single - cell resolution possible , essential capabilities for relating cell behavior to mechanisms of in - vasion ( Chantrain et al . 2004 , Farina et al . 1998 ) . However , conventional one - photon laser - scanning confocal microscopy is limited bytherelativelypooropticaldepthofpenetra - tion of short wavelength excitation light , pho - tobleaching , and phototoxic damage to the whole tissue and not just at the focal point . The recent introduction of multiphoton mi - croscopy , which uses 800 – 900 nm light from a pulsedlaser , haslargelysolvedtheproblemsof photobleaching and toxicity and extended the depth of penetration by 20 - fold ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Helmchen & Denk 2002 , Jain et al . 2002 , Wang et al . 2002 , Williams et al . 2001 , Zipfel et al . 2003b ) . In addition , the multiphoton excitationof tissue causes second harmonic scattering of photons from α - helix - containing proteins , thus allowing the imag - ing of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen without the need for ﬂuorescent la - beling of the tissue matrix ( Campagnola et al . 2001 , Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Zipfel et al . 2003a ) . This beneﬁt of multiphoton excita - tion can be used to analyze cell - extracellular matrix interactions and matrix remodeling di - rectly in live tissue ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Masters et al . 1997 ) . The application of gra - dient index ( GRIN ) lens technology to multi - photon imaging holds the promise of extend - ing intravital imaging to any depth within live mice , making systemic analysis of tumor in - vasion and metastasis possible ( Levene et al . 2004 ) . The tumor cell behaviors in live tu - mors discussed in the next section are de - rived from studies using laser - scanning confo - cal and multiphoton imaging in rats and mice . Motility Behaviors Contributing to Invasion and Intravasation An understanding of the motility of cancer cells and its contribution to metastasis has begun to emerge from intravital imaging of cells , at single - cell resolution , inside tumors within living animals . An important outcome of studying tumor cells within their normal tumor environment is that the behavior ob - served is an indication of what tumor cells actually do in vivo , not what they can do as inferred from in vitro and ectopic models in vivo . That is , artiﬁcial models such as ec - topic growth of tumor cells in tissues in which tumors do not normally form , e . g . , growing breast tumor cells in dermis instead of mam - mary gland , can lead to the observation of cell behaviors that do not occur in real breast tu - mors . Tumor models where tumor cells are grown in tissue that is the natural site for the tumor , e . g . , breast in breast , are called ortho - topic models . The behaviors discussed next are those seen in orthotopic models . A number of behaviors have been ob - served in orthotopic models in vivo that re - late to metastatic potential . These form a pat - tern common to a variety of tumor types and provide insight into mechanisms of invasion and intravasation ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Farina et al . 1998 , Friedl & Wolf 2003 , Sahai et al . 2005 , Wang et al . 2002 , Wyckoff et al . 2000a ) . Tumor cells in primary mammary tumors move as solitary cells at up to 10 times their velocity in vitro . Tumor cell motility is characterized as solitary amoeboid move - ment , but it can also occur as cell streams and linear ﬁles suggesting the use of common www . annualreviews . org • Invasion Signatures of Breast Tumors 697 A nnu .

ANRV255 - CB21 - 28 ARI 8 September 2005 17 : 16 paths on extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ﬁbers ( Farina et al . 1998 , Friedl & Wolf 2003 , Sahai et al . 2005 , Wang et al . 2002 , Wyck - off et al . 2000a ) . In fact , the highest velocities are observed for carcinoma cells in metastatic tumors that are moving along linear paths in association with ECM ﬁbers , in particular , collagen ﬁbers . These high - velocity linear ex - cursionsareunrestrictedbynetworksofECM in mammary tumors , except around blood vessels ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 ) . Intravasation and invadopodia . Tumor cell motility is restricted at the basement mem - brane of blood vessels , where the cells must squeeze through small pores in the base - ment membrane / endothelium to gain access to the blood space . The degree to which the basement membrane of blood vessels repre - sents a barrier has been documented by di - rect observations of cell behavior during in - travasation . Carcinoma cells in nonmetastatic tumors are fragmented during intravasation as they squeeze across the basement mem - brane / endothelium indicating that the cell must be highly distended and under tension as it crosses . Remarkably , carcinoma cells in metastatic tumors cross this restriction as in - tact cells , possibly in large measure owing to the high levels of expression of cytokeratins in metastatic cells ( Wang et al . 2002 ) and their ability to extend invadopodia ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Wang et al . 2002 , Wyckoff et al . 2000a , Yamaguchi et al . 2005 ) . Chemotaxis to blood vessels . Carcinoma cells in metastatic tumors are attracted to blood vessels , where they form a layer of cells that are morphologically polarized toward the vessel . Chemotaxis to epidermal growth fac - tor by carcinoma cells has been demonstrated in vivo ( Wyckoff et al . 2004 ) and resem - bles that observed for tumor cells in vitro ( Wyckoff et al . 2000b ) . Chemotaxis ability of tumor cells is highly correlated with their po - tential for invasion , intravasation , and metas - tasis and appears responsible for the attraction of carcinoma cells to blood vessels ( Wyckoff et al . 2000a ) . Cell polarity toward blood ves - sels is correlated with increased intravasa - tion and metastasis , indicating a local blood vessel associated source of chemoattractants ( Pollard 2004 , Wyckoff et al . 2004 ) . Blood vessel – associated macrophages are a source of EGF and other chemoattrac - tants . An in vivo invasion assay ( Wyckoff et al . 2000b ) has been used to study the mech - anism of chemotaxis in primary mammary tu - mors of rats and mice . These studies demon - strate that macrophages form a paracrine loop with invasive tumor cells ( Wyckoff et al . 2004 ) . Expression analysis of tumor cells and macrophages caught invading together indi - cates how these cells are attracted to each other and can invade jointly : Tumor cells ex - press CSF - 1 , which stimulates macrophage chemotaxis , whereas macrophages express epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , which stim - ulates tumor cell chemotaxis ( Wyckoff et al . 2004 ) . Because metastatic mammary tumors contain large numbers of rapidly moving macrophages with many clustered near blood vessels ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Wyckoff et al . 2000a ) , they are a local source of chemo - tactic cytokines and chemotactic growth fac - tors , such as EGF , within the tissue and near blood vessels ( Lin et al . 2001 , Pollard 2004 , Wyckoff et al . 2004 ) . The in vitro assay of invasive cell motility inside collagen matrices demonstrates that macrophages and tumor cells and the activity of their CSF - 1 and EGF receptors , respectively , are necessary and suf - ﬁcientforenhancementofinvasion ( Goswami et al . 2005 ) . IS THERE AN EXPRESSION SIGNATURE THAT CORRELATES WITH THESE BEHAVIORS ? The Concept of an Invasion Signature Gene expression proﬁling has been used ex - tensively in an attempt to sort tumors into 698 Condeelis · Singer · Segall A nnu . R e v . C e ll . D e v .

In addition , expres - sion proﬁling has been used in an attempt to identify invasion - and metastasis - speciﬁc genes that might predict the metastatic po - tential of tumors and to gain insight into the mechanisms of invasion and metastasis . In general , studies involving ( a ) entire primary tumors , ( b ) laser capture microdissection of ﬁxed primary tumors , and ( c ) cells isolated from metastases of bone marrow , lymphatics and distant solid organs have identiﬁed can - didate genes that might be important for tu - mor cell invasion ( reviewed in Wang et al . 2005 ) . However , such approaches have had limitations : (cid:1) Expression analysis of whole primary tumors provides bulk tumor expression patterns , in which case the speciﬁc pat - terns of expression typical of invasive cells might be diluted . (cid:1) Laser capture microdissection studies must rely on morphology and histolog - ical location , an uncertain exercise , to select cells that might have been invad - ing , thereby making the relevance to in - vasion of expression proﬁles from such cells questionable . (cid:1) Isolating cells from metastases are likely to produce expression proﬁles that are relevant to successful growth at the new site but not necessarily proﬁles indica - tive of invasion potential from the pri - mary tumor . In an alternative approach , an in vivo invasion assay , based on the chemotaxis of tumor cells to blood vessels seen in vivo ( Wyckoff et al . 2000b ) , was used to collect in - vasive cells from live primary tumors in mice and rats . Because the in vivo invasion assay employs microneedles containing chemoat - tractants such as EGF and extracellular ma - trix that mimic conditions around blood ves - sels that are involved in chemotaxis ( Wyckoff et al . 2000b , 2004 ) , the invasive cells col - lected are likely also to be the cells involved inintravasation . Invasivetumorcellscollected by this method can then be interrogated di - rectly relative to the tumor cells that re - main behind in the primary tumor and , after subtraction of gene expression changes oc - curring in response to EGF and other col - lection conditions , this reveals the expres - sion pattern unique to invasive tumor cells , an “invasion signature . ” The invasion signa - ture shown in Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 is derived from invasive cells collected in rat mammary tumors generated from carcinoma cell lines ( Goswamietal . 2004 ; Wangetal . 2003 , 2004 ) . A similar invasion signature has been derived from mouse mammary tumors resulting from expression of the PyMT oncogene in situ ( W . Wang , personal communication ) . This indicates that the invasion signature is com - mon to mammary tumors in rats and mice re - gardless of the origins of the mammary tumor . The invasion signature shown in Tables 1 , 2 , and 3 indicates that invasive cells are a popu - lation that is neither proliferating nor apop - toticbutishighlymotile ( Goswamietal . 2004 , Wang et al . 2004 ) . The reduction in apopto - sis is consistent with tumor cells having a sur - vival advantage owing to suppression of apop - tosis genes and up - regulation of prosurvival genes ( Table 2 ) . Furthermore , the pattern of expression of genes involved in proliferation suggests that invasive tumor cells are not pro - liferating ( Table 1 ) . This predicts that cancer treatments targeting cell growth may not be very effective at killing invasive tumor cells . This was tested by exposing invasive cells col - lected using the in vivo invasion assay to con - ventional chemotherapy that is directed at di - viding cells . As predicted , the invasive cells survived better compared with non - invasive cells from the same tumor ( Goswami et al . 2004 ) . Several of the genes of the invasion signature have been identiﬁed in clinical and conventional gene expression proﬁling studies .

The fold changes in gene expression of the invasion signature shown in Tables 1 – 3 were found to be statistically signiﬁcant in the invasive cells by Chi - square or SAM analysis . In addition , in all cases , P < 0 . 05 . Random sets of equal numbers of genes did not generate the same pattern of up - and down - regulation , indicating that the pattern was not observed by chance ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Similarly , clustering the results from all genes of the general population in the same space of all genes on the microarray did not yield an outcome similar to the invasion signature . All results are from Goswami et al . 2004 and Wang et al . 2004 . b The fold change indicates the level of expression in the invasive tumor cells compared with the general population of tumor cells of the primary tumor . and colorectal cancers have implicated Rho A , Rock ( Kamai et al . 2003 ) , Mena ( Di Modugno et al . 2004 ) , and the Arp2 and 3 subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Otsubo et al . 2004 ) , respectively , as up - regulated in these cancers . Studies have suggested that the elevated expression of Arp2 / 3 complex by both neoplastic and stromal cells contributes to the increased motility of both cell types and thus provides suitable conditions for in - vasion ( Otsubo et al . 2004 ) . In addition , LIM - kinase 1 is up - regulated in metastatic breast and prostate tumors ( Davila et al . 2003 , Yoshioka et al . 2003 ) . Hence , the pathways in - volved in actin polymerization at the leading edge are implicated in invasion by different approaches ( Figure 1 ) . HOW DO THE GENES OF THE INVASION SIGNATURE CONTRIBUTE TO INVASION ? Coordinate Regulation of Motility Pathways in Invasion An important insight into the special motility properties of invasive cells , the high speeds of locomotion , chemotaxis , and invadopod for - mation , comes from the motility pathways portion of the invasion signature ( Table 3 ) . That is , the ﬁnding that the genes coding for the key effectors of the minimum motil - ity machine ( Loisel et al . 1999 ) , i . e . , the coﬁlin , cappingprotein , andArp2 / 3pathways , that regulate β - actin polymerization at the leading edge , are dramatically up - regulated 700 Condeelis · Singer · Segall A nnu .

( Figure 1 ) ( Wang et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , the genes of the motility portion of the in - vasion signature ( Table 3 ) can be organized into a series of converging pathways based on the known functions of the proteins for which they code ( Figure 2 ) ( Wang et al . 2004 ) . The functions of each of these pathways and how they may contribute to the behavior of tumor cells during invasion and intravasation is con - sidered next . Coﬁlin pathway . The coﬁlin family of pro - teins in vertebrates consists of coﬁlin / ADF . The coﬁlin pathway for invasive carcinoma cells is summarized in Figure 2 a , with the genes whose expression is altered in invasive tumor cells highlighted . The invasion signa - ture indicates that the coﬁlin activity cycle has been impacted at several levels of regulation in invasive cells . Coﬁlin is the more abundant isoform of the family in carcinoma cells , and its expression is highly up - regulated in inva - sive cells ( Figure 2 a ) . Coﬁlin’s severing and depolymerization activitiesareinhibitedbyphosphorylation , G - actin binding , and binding to phosphatidyli - nositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( Bamburg 1999 , DesMarais et al . 2004a , Paavilainen et al . 2004 ) . Changes in pH can also regu - late the level of activity of coﬁlin , but over the physiological range of pH found in vertebrate cells ( 6 . 6 – 7 . 4 ) ( Bernstein et al . 2000 ) , the ac - tivities of coﬁlin are only graded , not inacti - vated , suggesting that pH may act more like a www . annualreviews . org • Invasion Signatures of Breast Tumors 701 A nnu .

The consequence of regulating coﬁlin by phosphorylation appears to differ by cell type . In some cell types , coﬁlin is almost 100 % phosphorylated in resting cells and motility is stimulated by dephosphorylation ( Kanamori et al . 1995 , Okada et al . 1996 ) . In carcinoma cells in serum , phospho - coﬁlin is less than half of the total coﬁlin at steady state ( Zebda et al . 702 Condeelis · Singer · Segall A nnu . R e v . C e ll . D e v .

The major effectors responsible for leading - edge polymerization are coﬁlin , capping protein , and the Arp2 / 3 complex .

The fold changes in gene expression in this and Figure 2 were determined by quantitative real - time PCR and are indicated as ( n x ) . Coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 complex are synergistic in the production of free barbed ends leading to dendritic nucleation and protrusive force . Capping protein funnels the available G - actin onto productive elongating barbed ends by capping nonproductive barbed ends . The four pathways therefore coordinately generate protrusions that act to steer the cells during chemotaxis and invasion . 2000 ) , and in serum - starved cells , phospho - coﬁlin is as little as 10 % of the total coﬁlin ( X . Song & R . Eddy , personal communica - tion ) . Even so , coﬁlin in both cases is mostly inactive ( Chan et al . 2000 ) , indicating that a mechanism other than phosphorylation must be at work to inhibit coﬁlin activity in carci - noma cells . Another function of phosphorylation of coﬁlin in carcinoma cells is the recycling of coﬁlin from G - actin . Coﬁlin binds to G - actin with submicromolar afﬁnity and the heterodimer is inactive in both severing and depolymerization ( Bamburg 1999 , Paavilainen et al . 2004 ) . The release of coﬁlin from this heterodimer is crucial to the www . annualreviews . org • Invasion Signatures of Breast Tumors 703 A nnu . R e v . C e ll . D e v . B i o l . 2005 . 21 : 695 - 718 .

ANRV255 - CB21 - 28 ARI 8 September 2005 17 : 16 recycling of coﬁlin activity . Cyclase - associated protein ( CAP ) is capable of releas - ing coﬁlin from the heterodimer through a direct interaction with actin ( Bertling et al . 2004 , Paavilainen et al . 2004 ) . In addition , because phospho - coﬁlin cannot bind to actin , LIM - kinase may also be involved in breaking the G - actin - coﬁlin heterodimer in vivo . Phosphorylation may also function to put limits on the amplitude , location , and duration of coﬁlin activity after its activation by EGF . Hence , while the phosphorylation / dephosphorylation cycle of coﬁlin may not be directly involved in the activation of coﬁlin in carcinoma cells by EGF , LIM - kinase , along with CAP , may be crucial in regulating the localization and recycling of coﬁlin activity . Four different kinases that appear to be downstream of the Rho - family GTPases have been shown to phosphorylate coﬁlin , LIM - kinase 1 and 2 , and TES - kinase 1 and 2 ( Arber et al . 1998 , Dan et al . 2001 , Rosok et al . 1999 , Toshima et al . 2001 , Yang et al . 1998 ) . In invasive carcinoma cells , LIM - kinase 1 is Figure 2 The pathways to barbed end generation and protrusive force . The fold changes in gene expression are indicated as ( n x ) . ( a ) The coﬁlin pathway leading to barbed end production in response to EGF . Gene for both inhibitory ( PAK , ROCK , LIM kinase ) and stimulatory ( PLC and PKC ζ ) inputs to coﬁlin are more highly expressed in invasive cells ; these regulate the location , timing , and sharpness of coﬁlin - dependent actin polymerization transients that are required for chemotaxis . For a , the inhibitory parts are in yellow and the stimulatory parts in white . ( b ) The capping protein pathway leading to barbed end capping . Genes for both inhibition ( Mena and PI5K ) and stimulation ( capping protein ) of the capping activity of this pathway are more highly expressed in invasive cells .

Furthermore , the ac - tivation of LIM - kinase 1 occurs through the PI3K - induced activation of Rho - family G - proteins , whichactivatePAKandROCK . Rho is highly expressed in invasive cells . Either PAK ( Edwards et al . 1999 ) or ROCK ( Ohashi et al . 2000 ) can phosphorylate LIM - kinase at threonine 508 thereby activating it to increase coﬁlin phosphorylation . Both kinases are also up - regulated in invasive cells ( Figure 2 a ) . Inhibition of LIM - kinase activity is PKC dependent , and this involves one of the atyp - ical PKC isoforms ( Djafarzadeh & Niggli 1997 , Kuroda et al . 1996 ) . LIM - kinase and PKC ζ tightly associate via the interaction through the second LIM domain of LIM - kinase , which indicates direct phosphoryla - tion of LIM - kinase ( Kuroda et al . 1996 ) . Additional studies have implicated the δ iso - form of PKC as a negative regulator of LIM - kinase ( Martiny - Baron et al . 1993 ) . The ex - pression of PKC ζ is up - regulated in invasive cells ( Figure 2 a ) . The general pattern of regulation in the coﬁlin pathway indicates that genes coding for proteins that both increase and decrease the activity of coﬁlin are coordinately up - regulated along with coﬁlin itself . This pat - tern may result from the toxicity of ele - vated coﬁlin expression ( reviewed in Ghosh www . annualreviews . org • Invasion Signatures of Breast Tumors 705 A nnu . R e v . C e ll . D e v .

Alternatively , the signiﬁcance of this paradoxical pattern may be understood when one considers that the coﬁlin pathway is di - rectly involved in sensing during chemotaxis of carcinoma cells to EGF ( Mouneimne et al . 2004 ) , and coﬁlin is sufﬁcient to set the di - rection of cell movement ( Ghosh et al . 2004 ) . Directional sensing of EGF requires an early transient of free , actin ﬁlament barbed ends resulting from coﬁlin severing that causes lo - calizedactinpolymerization ( Chanetal . 2000 , Mouneimne et al . 2004 ) . If the free barbed ends of the early transient are either inhib - ited or sustained , then directional protrusion in response to EGF fails ( Chan et al . 2000 , Mouneimne et al . 2004 , Zebda et al . 2000 ) . That is , it is the generation of a transient of free barbed ends that is essential in di - rectional sensing , not sustained polymeriza - tion . The up - regulation of genes that both increase and decrease coﬁlin severing activity , as seen in Figure 2 a , is consistent with the enhanced ability of invasive cells to generate an early transient that is essential for chemo - taxis . In addition , the localization and timing of the stimulatory and inhibitory branches of the coﬁlin pathway are believed to determine the precise location and duration of coﬁlin ac - tivityanditsrecyclingtocompartmentswhere coﬁlin is inhibited in resting cells ( DesMarais et al . 2004a ) . Capping protein pathway . Capping protein binds to the growing barbed ends of actin ﬁla - ments to prevent further elongation and reg - ulate ﬁlament length . The patterns of regula - tion of genes of the capping protein pathway exhibit the same antagonistic relationships as seen in the coﬁlin pathway where expression of stimulatory and inhibitory branches are up - regulated together . Expression of both the α and β - subunits of capping protein is dramat - ically increased , suggesting higher capping protein activity in the pathway . However , the expression of genes that code for proteins that are inhibitory to capping protein activity , the type II - α isoform of PI4 , 5 kinase ( Cooper & Schafer 2000 ) and Mena ( Bear et al . 2002 ) , are also up - regulated ( Figure 2 b ) . Capping pro - tein , like coﬁlin , is essential for viability , and largechangesinitsexpressionlevelmaynotbe toleratedbycellsovertime ( Cooper & Schafer 2000 ) . Therefore , a more interesting inter - pretation of these results is that the amplitude and sharpness of capping protein activity as a transient is increased in invasive cells because of this antagonistic pattern of expression . The combination of heightened transient capping protein activity and changes in its timing and location could synergize with the barbed end generating activities of the coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 pathways ( Figure 1 ) to cause intense focal bursts of actin polymerization , as observed in in vitro experiments with puriﬁed proteins ( Carlier 1998 , Loisel et al . 1999 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex pathway . Both the coﬁlin and capping protein pathways converge on the Arp2 / 3 complex . Because the expression of key components of both pathways is up - regulated , it is interesting that the expres - sion of several subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex are also greatly up - regulated in invasive cells , as is the expression of upstream stimulators of the Arp2 / 3 complex , WAVE 3 and Cdc42 ( Figure 2 c ) . Coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 complex synergis - tically contribute to the nucleation of a dendritic array both in vitro ( Ichetovkin et al . 2002 ) and in vivo ( DesMarais et al . 2004b ) . This synergy results from the am - pliﬁcation of the Arp2 / 3 complex’s nucle - ation activity by coﬁlin’s severing activity , which creates barbed ends that elongate to form newly polymerized actin ﬁlaments ( Ichetovkin et al . 2002 ) . The newly poly - merized ﬁlaments are the preferred ﬁlament type for Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching ( DesMarais et al . 2004a , b ; Ichetovkin et al . 2002 ) . This synergistic ampliﬁcation of the Arp2 / 3 complex activity has been proposed to explain the ability of coﬁlin to determine sites of protrusion and cell direction in uncaging 706 Condeelis · Singer · Segall A nnu .

ANRV255 - CB21 - 28 ARI 8 September 2005 17 : 16 Figure 3 The stimulated protrusion model showing the role of coﬁlin severing in determining the site of dendritic nucleation , protrusion , and cell direction . Severing of actin ﬁlaments in the cortical actin cytoskeleton by coﬁlin creates free barbed ends that bias the location and the amount of dendritic nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Polymerization proceeds from a pool of pre - existing actin monomers , allowing the initiation of polymerization to occur without being tightly coupled to depolymerization . Redrawn from DesMarais et al . ( 2004a ) . experiments ( DesMarais et al . 2004a , Ghosh et al . 2004 ) ( Figure 3 ) . Capping protein funnels actin monomers onto newly created free barbed ends by cap - ping older ﬁlaments , thereby enhancing the formation of the short , branched ﬁlaments characteristic of Arp2 / 3 complex - nucleated dendritic arrays ( Carlier 1998 ) . WAVE 3 is believed to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , as do its relatives WAVEs 1 and 2 ( Takenawa & Miki 2001 ) . Both WAVEs 1 and 2 are regulated by Rac 1 , which reg - ulates their interaction with Arp2 / 3 com - plex to cause stimulation of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex’s nucleation activity ( Eden et al . 2002 , Miki et al . 2000 , Steffen et al . 2004 ) . This in turn causes lateral ( WAVE 2 - dependent ) and dorsal ( WAVE 1 - dependent ) protrusions ( Suetsugu et al . 2003 ) . However , the molec - ular mechanism of regulation of WAVE 3 is unknown , as are the phenotypic consequences on cell behavior of stimulating WAVE 3 . More work will need to be done on the conse - quences of WAVE 3 expression and activation in carcinoma cells to understand its signiﬁ - cance for tumor cell invasion . An interesting ﬁnding is the coordinated up - regulation of expression of genes for sev - eral subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex and Cdc42 . Cdc42 regulates N - WASP , a ubiq - uitous member of the WASP family , which induces actin polymerization by activating Arp2 / 3 complex ( Ho et al . 2004 ) . Regula - tion of the activity of N - WASP involves an intramolecular interaction by which the VCA ( verproline / coﬁlin / acidic ) domain , the active site that binds to Arp2 / 3 complex , is masked by the N - terminal regulatory re - gion of N - WASP ( Kim et al . 2000 , Rohatgi et al . 2000 ) . The known regulators of N - WASP activity appear to operate by either stabilizing or destabilizing this autoinhibitory www . annualreviews . org • Invasion Signatures of Breast Tumors 707 A nnu .

ANRV255 - CB21 - 28 ARI 8 September 2005 17 : 16 conformation ( Ho et al . 2004 ) . Elevated ex - pression of Cdc42 , as observed in invasive cells , in combination with the elevated expres - sion of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2 c ) , would be expected to enhance the activity of the N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 complex pathway , thereby leading to increased invadopod production and cell invasion ( Mizutani et al . 2002 , Yam - aguchietal . 2005 ) . Coﬁlinalsohasbeenfound to amplify and stabilize N - WASP generated invadopods , suggestingthatthesynergisticin - teractionbetweenthecoﬁlinandArp2 / 3com - plex pathways described above is at work dur - ing invasion ( Ghosh et al . 2004 , Yamaguchi et al . 2005 ) . An additional consequence of increased Cdc42 expression might be its effect on the ability of tumor cells to acquire polarity to blood vessels , as observed during intravasa - tion . Carcinoma cells in metastatic tumors are attracted to blood vessels , where they form a layer of cells that are morphologi - cally polarized toward the vessel . This vessel - directed polarization is believed to be im - portant for intravasation ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Wyckoff et al . 2000a ) . Chemotaxis un - doubtedly contributes to the accumulation of cells around the vessels , but the acquisition of vessel - directed polarity might require ad - ditional steps in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton . A consensus has been building that Cdc42 is involved in determining the direction of cell movement and cell polarity . Inhi - bition of Cdc42 prevents macrophage mi - gration toward a chemotactic signal ( Allen et al . 1998 ) and directional migration in as - trocytes ( Etienne - Manneville & Hall 2001 ) . The development of stable cell polarity in astrocytes involves Cdc42 , the orienta - tion of the microtubule organizing cen - ter , and depends on microtubule dynamics ( nocodazole - sensitive ) but not on actin poly - merization ( Etienne - Manneville & Hall2001 , Gundersen et al . 2004 ) . In microtubule - dependent cell polarization in astrocytes , Cdc42 activation involves recruitment of a GEF , FGD - 1 and appears to operate through Par6 to recruit PKC ζ to inactivate GSK3b ( Etienne - Manneville & Hall 2003 ) . This pathway requires stimulation of integrins be - cause arginine - glycine - aspartate ( RGD ) pep - tides inhibit the activation of Cdc42 , PKC , and protrusion ( Etienne - Manneville & Hall 2001 ) . However , chemotaxis by tumor cells re - quires actin polymerization and is unaffected by concentrations of nocodazole ( 100 nM ) sufﬁcient to block microtubule dynamics and inhibit cell polarity in astrocytes ( Segall et al . 1996 ) . In addition , N - WASP , a major effector ofCdc42 , isrequiredforinvadopodformation ( Yamaguchi et al . 2005 ) and chemotaxis in tu - mor cells ( L . Soon , personal communication ) , indicating that cell polarization toward EGF in these cells is dependent on Cdc42 through N - WASP and actin polymerization . During N - WASP - and actin - dependent events at the leading edge of lamellipods , the Cdc42 GEF , intersectin 1 , binds to and is activated by N - WASP ( Hussain et al . 2001 ) . Therefore , N - WASP may recruit , through intersectin 1 , GDP - Cdc42 and activate it locally at the lead - ing edge , making N - WASP function in the polarization to EGF of tumor cells analo - gous to that of Par6 in cell polarity during wounding . Furthermore , PKC ζ may be in - volved in the regulation of LIM - kinase activ - ity , which may regulate the amount of active coﬁlin at the leading edge and its synergy with N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 complex – mediated protru - sion activity ( Figure 1 ) . These results il - lustrate parallels between how cells polar - ize ( microtubule - dependent ) and chemotax ( actin - dependent ) and suggest that N - WASP is involved in assembly of a compartment at the leading edge , analogous to the po - larity complex in polarizing cells ( Etienne - Manneville & Hall 2001 ) , that is required for cell polarity during chemotaxis . ZBP1 pathway . A gene whose expression is strongly down - regulated in invasive cells is ZBP1 ( Figure 1 ) . ZBP1 is a member of a fam - ily of RNA - binding proteins that contain four C - terminal hnRNP - K homology domains 708 Condeelis · Singer · Segall A nnu . R e v . C e ll . D e v . B i o l . 2005 . 21 : 695 - 718 . D o w n l o a d e d fr o m a r j ou r n a l s . a n n u a l r e v i e w s . o r g by A L B E R T E I N S TE I N C O LLE G E O F M E D I C I N E on 10 / 07 / 05 .

ZBP1 is a 68 - kDa RNA - binding protein that binds to the mRNA zip - code of β - actin mRNA and func - tions to localize β - actin mRNA to the leading edge of crawling cells . Because β - actin is the preferred isoform of actin for the polymeriza - tion of ﬁlaments at the leading edge of cells , it is acted on by the coﬁlin , capping protein , and Arp2 / 3 pathways ( Shestakova et al . 2001 ) . β - actin mRNA localization is required for the maintenance of stable cell polarity as observed in the absence of exogenous signals such as that seen in normal primary ﬁbroblasts , ep - ithelial cells , and tumor cells with differing metastatic potential in which actin polymer - ization is nucleated at only one pole of the cell in normal and nonmetastatic tumor cells ( Shestakova et al . 1999 ) . Disruption of ZBP1 - mediated β - actinmRNAtargetingincultured cells leads to cells without cell polarity that are able to nucleate actin polymerization globally and exhibit amoeboid movement ( Shestakova et al . 2001 ) . Therefore , ZBP1 may determine the sites in cells where the Arp2 / 3 complex , capping protein , and coﬁlin pathways con - verge to determine the leading edge and cell polarity by controlling the sites of targeting of β - actin mRNA and the location of β - actin protein that is the common downstream ef - fector of these pathways . Tests of Function of Genes of the Invasion Signature in Chemotaxis , Invasion , and Metastasis The genes of the motility part of the invasion signature can be organized into three con - verging pathways based on the known func - tions of the proteins for which they code ( Figure 2 ) . The functions of key gene prod - ucts in these pathways and how they affect chemotaxis , invasion , and metastasis by car - cinoma cells have been tested . The results of these tests are described next . Coﬁlin and LIM - kinase . Direct tests of coﬁlin function are complicated by the fact that coﬁlin is required for viability , which makes genetic approaches in carcinoma cells difﬁcult to interpret . However , the acute in - hibition of coﬁlin activity in carcinoma cells inhibits the generation of barbed ends and actin polymerization at the leading edge in re - sponse to EGF ( Chan et al . 2000 , DesMarais et al . 2004b ) . Inhibition of coﬁlin activity , through either the inhibition of PLC γ or di - rect inhibition using acute siRNA suppres - sion of coﬁlin expression and coﬁlin function blocking antibodies , inhibits the early barbed end transient that is essential for the chemo - taxis of carcinoma cells to EGF ( Mouneimne et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , coﬁlin is required for the formation of the stable invadopods by carcinoma cells that are important in the invasion of dense extracellular matrix ( Mullins et al . 1998 , Yamaguchi et al . 2005 ) , particularly that found around blood vessels ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 ) . Finally , the lo - cal activation of coﬁlin in carcinoma cells is sufﬁcient to generate protrusive activity and determine cell direction ( Ghosh et al . 2004 ) . All these results indicate that coﬁlin is essen - tial for the chemotaxis and invasion of mam - marycarcinomacellstoEGFthroughamech - anism involving the localized generation of barbed ends that causes the localized protru - sion , which deﬁnes cell direction ( Figure 3 ) . The effects of altering LIM - kinase expres - sion have been studied in tumor cells by sev - eral groups , who have shown that overex - pression of LIM - kinase 1 in tumor cell lines increases their motility and invasiveness in vitro ( Davila et al . 2003 , Yoshioka et al . 2003 ) . Experimental reduction in the expres - sion of LIM - kinase 1 in metastatic prostate cell lines decreased invasiveness in matrigel invasion assays . To study the effect of LIM - kinase 1 on metastasis in vivo , an experimen - tal mestastasis model was used where cells were injected directly into the left ventricle of mice ( Yoshioka et al . 2003 ) . In this case , the ability of cancer cells to survive in the blood , extravasate from blood vessels , and grow at metastatic sites all contribute to the metas - tasis score , so it is not clear how these www . annualreviews . org • Invasion Signatures of Breast Tumors 709 A nnu .

ANRV255 - CB21 - 28 ARI 8 September 2005 17 : 16 results relate to invasion in the primary tu - mor . In general , these results are consistent with the observed overexpression of LIM - kinase 1 in invasive cells in mammary tu - mors and their invasion signature ( Table 3 , Figure 2 a ) . In a separate set of studies , the overex - pression of either full - length - regulated LIM - kinase 1 or its constitutively active kinase domain has been reported to inhibit coﬁlin activity in vivo by phosphorylation . Overex - pression also inhibits EGF - induced barbed end production , in particular the early barbed endtransient , andlamellipodextensionincul - ture ( W . Wang , G . Mouneimne , J . Wyckoff , X . Chen , M . Sidani , and J . Condeelis , un - published data ; Zebda et al . 2000 ) . Further - more , the overexpression of full - length LIM - kinase 1 in carcinoma cells without altering coﬁlin expression is correlated with the in - hibition of chemotaxis , invasion , intravasa - tion , and metastasis of tumor cells in mam - mary tumors prepared from these carcinoma cells ( W . Wang , G . Mouneimne , J . Wyckoff , X . Chen , M . Sidani , and J . Condeelis , un - published data ) . Although these results ap - pear contradictory to those described above , in fact they are consistent with the invasion signature associated with the coﬁlin pathway ( Figure 2 a ) . That is , highly invasive cells up - regulate LIM - kinase 1 , coﬁlin , and their stimulatory and inhibitory effectors together ( Figure 2 a ) , consistent with the hypothe - sis that the up - regulation of both inhibitory and stimulatory branches of the coﬁlin path - way increases the amplitude and sharpness of coﬁlin - dependent actin polymerization tran - sients that are essential for chemotaxis and in - vasion in carcinoma cells ( Mouneimne et al . 2004 ; W . Wang , G . Mouneimne , J . Wyckoff , X . Chen , M . Sidani , and J . Condeelis , un - published data ) . Therefore , to compare stud - ies in which the expression of LIM - kinase , coﬁlin , or other members of this pathway are experimentally altered , it is essential to measure the output of the coﬁlin path - way as the timing and amplitude of coﬁlin - dependent barbed end production during chemotaxis . Manipulations that increase the coﬁlin - dependent barbed end production of the early transient during chemotaxis are pre - dicted to increase invasiveness , and this pre - dicts that studies in which cells are more in - vasive and metastatic after overexpression of LIM - kinase have associated compensatory in - creases in the expression of other members of the coﬁlin pathway so as to increase barbed end production in response to EGF . Addi - tional work will be required to investigate this possibility . N - WASP . N - WASP has been implicated in invasion of extracellular matrix in a number of studies . The invasion of Madin - Darby canine kidney cells during tubulogenesis in collagen gels is inhibited by expression of dominant - negative N - WASP ( Yamaguchi et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , N - WASP , in cooperation with coﬁlin , is required for the formation of in - vadopods ( Yamaguchi et al . 2005 ) , and its ac - tivity is localized to nascent invadopods dur - ing the invasion of ﬁbronectin gels ( Lorenz et al . 2004 ) . In particular , the depletion of N - WASP or the p34arc subunit of Arp2 / 3 complex by siRNA interference suppresses invadopod formation . In addition , siRNA in - terference and dominant - negative mutant ex - pression analyses revealed that coﬁlin and the N - WASP regulators , Nck1 , Cdc42 , and WIP , but not Grb2 and WISH , are necessary for in - vadopod formation ( Yamaguchi et al . 2005 ) . EGF receptor kinase inhibitors block the for - mation of invadopods by carcinoma cells in the presence of serum , and EGF stimula - tion of serum - starved cells induces invadopod formation . These results indicate that EGF receptor - activated N - WASP and coﬁlin are required for the formation of invadopods and that Nck1 and Cdc42 mediate the signaling pathway . A phenomenon that may be related to chemotaxis , invadopod formation , and pathﬁnding is the observation that the local - izedstimulationoftheEGFreceptoroncarci - noma cells using EGF - bound beads results in localized actin polymerization and protrusion 710 Condeelis · Singer · Segall A nnu .

This highly focal actin polymerization requires the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by N - WASP and coﬁlin and isregulatedbyGrb2andNck2 ( Kempiaketal . 2005 ) . This phenomenon may be relevant to how EGF receptor ligands , which can bind to extracellular matrix , stimulate focal pro - trusions , invadopod formation , and adhesion in vivo ( Kempiak et al . 2005 ) . Additional work will be required to determine the effects of altering N - WASP activity on invasion , in - travasation , and metastasis in vivo . ZBP1 . The targeting of β - actin mRNA to the leading lamella is essential for stable cell polarity during locomotion , and ZBP1 is re - quired for mRNA targeting ( Condeelis & Singer 2005 ) . Highly metastatic cells lines have reduced levels of ZBP1 , and this is con - sistent with the reduction in ZBP1 expression seen in invasive cells ( Wang et al . 2004 ) . De - creased β - actin mRNA targeting seen in cells with reduced ZBP1 is correlated with the loss of cell polarity and increased amoeboid move - mentinmetastaticcarcinomacelllinesinvitro andinvivo ( Shestakovaetal . 1999 , Wangetal . 2002 ) and increased chemotaxis ( Wang et al . 2004 ) . Increasing the level of expression of ZBP1 in invasive carcinoma cells rescues the localization of β - actin mRNA to one pole of the cell and results in the inhibition of chemo - taxis to EGF both in vitro and in vivo in tu - mors . In addition , tumors prepared from cells re - expressing ZBP1 are signiﬁcantly less in - vasive and metastatic than their parental cell – generated counterparts ( Wang et al . 2004 ) . However , tumor growth is not signiﬁcantly affected by increasing the expression of ZBP1 . This suggests that the suppression of inva - sion and metastasis by ZBP1 is not related to growth of the tumor . These results are con - sistent with the observation that mouse mam - mary tumors that overexpress the ZBP1 ho - mologue CRD - BP are not metastatic ( Tessier et al . 2004 ) . The invasion and metastasis suppression activity of ZBP1 may result from its abil - ity to suppress the chemotaxis of cancer cells by maintaining them in a polarized epithelial cell - like state . Cells that lack an intrinsic and stable polarity are more chemotactic to ex - ogenous gradients , presumably because there is no intrinsic polarity to be overcome by the exogenous chemotactic signal and the cell can turn in any direction to respond to the gradi - ent ( Iijima et al . 2002 , Parent & Devreotes 1999 ) . This may account for the enhanced ability of invasive carcinoma cells to chemo - tax to blood vessels ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Wyckoff et al . 2000a ) . It also suggests that the generation of polarity in carcinoma cells that occurs around blood vessels is independent of ZBP1 activity , as discussed above . NEW INSIGHTS INTO TUMOR INVASION AND METASTASIS The identiﬁcation of an invasion signature for mammary tumors that implicates the coordinate regulation of genes involved in functionally related activities presents a rich collection of targets for chemotherapy not previously detected in conventional expres - sion proﬁling of whole tumors . The fact that the pathways are coordinately regulated in in - vasivecellssuggeststhatcombinationsofther - apeutics may be particularly effective . An additional insight resulting from the studyofinvasivecellsandtheirinvasionsigna - ture comes from the comparison of expression proﬁles obtained from invasive cells with the conventional expression proﬁles of whole tu - mors . Gene expression proﬁles of whole tu - mors have shown promise in prognosis by identifying patterns of expression that are cor - related with metastasis ( Ramaswamy et al . 2003 , van’t Veer et al . 2002 ) . However , un - like the invasion signature described for in - vasive cells , these patterns of expression ap - pear as random sets of genes with unrelated functions and thus are difﬁcult to interpret in terms of mechanisms of invasion and metas - tasis . This suggests that the invasion signa - ture is either averaged out when interrogat - ing the whole tumor because invasive cells are rare or that the changes in gene expression www . annualreviews . org • Invasion Signatures of Breast Tumors 711 A nnu .

ANRV255 - CB21 - 28 ARI 8 September 2005 17 : 16 that represent the invasion signature are largely transient . Therefore , it is interesting that the expression proﬁles of whole tumors demonstrate that the invasive and metastatic potential of the primary tumor can be en - coded early in the development of the tumor and throughout the bulk of the tumor in - cluding the stroma ( Ramaswamy et al . 2003 , van ’t Veer et al . 2002 ) . These results sug - gest that metastasis could occur early in tumor progression and that most cells in the tu - mor are potentially metastatic , thus favor - ing a “transient expression” model rather than an “averaged - out model” to explain the discordance between expression proﬁle re - sults . This conclusion is surprising because the traditional view of tumor progression is that tumors develop through a succession of stable genetic changes acquired through se - lection pressures , a process analogous to Dar - winian evolution . According to the traditional view of tumor progression , the cells selected to be metastatic are very rare , and metas - tasesarisefromprogressivegeneticchangesin these rare cells within a primary tumor delay - ing metastasis to late stages of tumor progres - sion ( Bernards & Weinberg 2002 , Hanahan & Weinberg 2000 ) . The Tumor Microenvironment Invasion Model A new model , the tumor microenvironment invasion model ( TMIM ) , has been proposed to explain the relationship between the ex - pression pattern of invasive cells and expres - sion patterns of whole tumors and how these relate to the traditional view of tumor pro - gression ( Wang et al . 2005 ) . In this model , the transient changes in gene expression lead - ing to invasion ( the invasion signature ) re - sult from microenvironments in the tumor that are deﬁned by stable genetic changes in both stromal and tumor cells . That is , tu - mor progression , as described by traditional models ( Hanahan & Weinberg 2000 ) , leads tothedevelopmentofmicroenvironmentsen - coded within the tumor , which elicit the tran - sient gene expression patterns that support invasion . In this context , invasion is similar to a morphogenetic program involving the transient expression of genes that lead to a change in the location of cells , a program that can occur repeatedly during tumor de - velopment and in any location in the tumor that has the microenvironment that elicits the morphogenetic program . The expression of genes that are synergistic for inducing mi - croenvironments causing invasion could lead to the random appearance , in time and loca - tion , of these microenvironments during tu - mor progression leading to repeated episodes of invasion and metastasis throughout tumor progression . TMIM is consistent with the ﬁnding that genes encoding the tumor microenvironment for invasion and metastasis appear to be ex - pressed throughout the bulk of the tumor . It is also consistent with the ability to col - lect invasive cells by chemotaxis using nee - dles that are placed in random locations in tu - mors if the growth factors inside the needles mimic microenvironments inducing invasion , as claimed ( Wang et al . 2004 , Wyckoff et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , the TMIM hypothesis is supported by intravital imaging of experi - mental tumors where only a small proportion of tumor cells are motile , and moving cells are not uniformly distributed but are observed in localized areas of the tumor ( Condeelis & Segall 2003 , Wang et al . 2002 ) , and the ob - servation that micrometastases are often ge - netically heterogeneous , suggesting that in - vasive behavior is not stably speciﬁed ( Klein 2002 ) . Finally , the TMIM hypothesis is con - sistent with our current understanding of how the tumor microenvironment contributes to invasion and metastasis ( Bissell & Radisky 2001 ) . The exciting new technologies reviewed here have brought us to the point where tu - mor invasion and metastasis can be studied as a problem in morphogenesis . The future will reveal if the new insights that are emerging will lead to new strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of metastasis . 712 Condeelis · Singer · Segall A nnu . R e v . C e ll .
