Periconceptional folic acid supplementation reduces the occur - rence of several human congenital malformations , including craniofacial , heart and neural tube defects 1 – 4 . Although the underlying mechanism is unknown , there may be a maternal - to - fetal folate - transport defect or an inherent fetal biochemical dis - order that is neutralized by supplementation . Previous experiments have identiﬁed a folate - binding protein 5 – 7 ( Folbp1 ) that functions as a membrane receptor to mediate the high - afﬁnity internalization and delivery of folate to the cytoplasm of the cell 8 – 10 . In vitro , this receptor facilitates the accumulation of cellular folate a thousand - fold relative to the media , suggest - ing that it may be essential in cytoplasmic folate delivery in vivo . The importance of an adequate intracellular folate pool for nor - mal embryogenesis has long been recognized in humans 11 – 16 and experimental animals 17 – 19 . To determine whether Folbp1 is involved in maternal - to - fetal folate transport , we inactivated Folbp1 in mice . We also produced mice lacking Folbp2 , another member of the folate receptor family that is GPI anchored but binds folate poorly 20 . Folbp2 – / – embryos developed normally , but Folbp1 – / – embryos had severe morphogenetic abnormalities and died in utero by embryonic day ( E ) 10 . Supplementing pregnant Folbp1 + / – dams with folinic acid reversed this phenotype in nul - lizygous pups . Our results suggest that Folbp1 has a critical role in folate homeostasis during development , and that functional defects in the human homologue ( FOLR1 ) of Folbp1 may con - tribute to similar defects in humans . We generated mice in which either Folbp1 or Folbp2 had been functionally inactivated by homologous recombination ( Fig . 1 ) . Heterozy - gous progeny of chimaeric animals were identi - ﬁed by Southern - blot analysis of Nde I - and Bgl II - digested tail DNA , and matings were estab - Fig . 1 Targeted inactivation of mouse Folbp1 by homolo - gous recombination . a , Partial genomic structure of endoge - nous Folbp1 . b , Partial genomic structure of Folbp1 following homologous recombination . c , Southern blot of adult genomic DNA digested with Nde I and probed with an Folbp1 exon 4 - speciﬁc probe . d , PCR analysis of fetal tissue DNA for the presence of the neo gene in the Folbp1 locus .

The breeding colony was established from two inde - pendently targeted embryonic stem ( ES ) cell clones , which gave identical results . We completed two generations of backcrosses to the C57BL / 6J strain before morphological analyses of the embryos . To determine if Folbp1 was being expressed during embryogenesis , we quantiﬁed mRNA levels in Folbp1 embryos using a ribonuclease protection assay ( Fig . 1 ) . Folbp1 mRNA was not present in Folbp1 – / – embryos , whereas Folbp1 + / – embryos had intermediate levels of mRNA expression compared with wild type . We then mated mice heterozygous for either the Folbp1 or the Folbp2 deletion . Litters from Folbp2 + / – matings averaged 7 . 4 pups born alive ( 7 . 38 ± 0 . 41 ) , which exceeded the number of pups observed from Folbp1 + / – crosses ( 6 . 41 ± 0 . 49 ) , although this dif - ference was not signiﬁcant ( P > 0 . 05 ) . Wild - type , Folbp2 + / – and Folbp2 – / – pups were physically indistinguishable and grew nor - mally into fertile adults . Surviving Folbp1 progeny were also indistinguishable and similarly developed into apparently healthy adults . When the survivors were genotyped , there were no nullizygous embryos , indicating that the mutation was an embryonic lethal . We collected embryos at different gestational stages during early embryogenesis to characterize the develop - mental impact of Folbp1 deletion . The embryonic development and progression through the dif - ferent stages of neural tube closure among the progeny of heterozy - gote matings are shown ( Table 1 ) . The growth and development of Folbp1 – / – embryos was severely retarded . The mean number of somites differed signiﬁcantly between embryos of wild - type and Folbp1 and Folbp2 mutant genotypes at all gestational time points ( P < 0 . 05 ) , except Folbp1 – / – embryos , which did not differ in somite number between E8 . 5 and E9 . 5 ( P > 0 . 05 ) . At E8 . 5 and E9 . 5 , Folbp1 – / – embryos had signiﬁcantly fewer somites than compara - bly aged wild - type , Folbp1 + / – , Folbp2 + / – and Folbp2 – / – embryos ( P < 0 . 05 ) . There were no signiﬁcant differences in the number of somites observed among wild - type , Folbp1 + / – , Folbp2 + / – and Folbp2 – / – embryos at E10 . 5 ( P > 0 . 05 ) . At E8 . 5 , Folbp1 – / – embryos were still in the characteristic S - shape , and had not yet begun their axial turning to assume a more advanced C - shape . Wild - type , Folbp1 + / – , Folbp2 + / – and Folbp2 – / – embryos followed the estab - lished progression through the four neural tube closure sites 21 . At E8 . 5 , 8 – 34 % of viable wild - type , Folbp1 + / – , Folbp2 + / – and Folbp2 – / – embryos had only completed closure I , whereas 50 – 80 % of the embryos had progressed further through neural tube closure ( Table 1 ) . By E9 . 5 , with the exception of Folbp1 – / – embryos , most of the embryos had closed neural tubes ( Table 1 ) . Wild - type , Folbp1 + / – , Folbp2 + / – and Folbp2 – / – embryos devel - oped normally when examined at E8 . 5 , E9 . 5 and E10 . 5 .

By contrast , Folbp1 – / – embryos at these gestational time points appeared developmen - tally delayed and morphologically abnormal . They die in utero before neural tube closure and are resorbed ( Fig . 2 ) . Histologic examination of transverse sections of E8 . 5 Folbp1 – / – embryos revealed defects in the neuroepithelium . In the cephalic neural tube , neither the forebrain nor the optic vesicles were formed ( Fig . 3 b ) . The neuroepithelium was only one to two cells thick . At the level of the midbrain , the neuroepithelium of both the basal and alar plates was also limited to no more than two cells in thickness . The migration of the neural crest cells was also altered , as only small aggregates of cells were identiﬁed in the mesenchyme in the region of the ﬁrst branchial arch . Further - more , there was no evidence of neural cell condensations lateral to the alar plate where the trigeminal ganglia normally develop ( Fig . 3 b ) . The neuroepithelial defect observed in the forebrain continued caudally , as it remained widely ﬂared and thinned at the level of the otic placode ( Fig . 3 d ) . In addition , the ectoderm forming the otic pit was thin and poorly deﬁned . Caudal to the otic pit , where in wild - type embryos the neural tube was closed , the mutant neuroepithelium remained open ( Fig . 3 f ) . We determined plasma folic acid concentrations in non - preg - nant wild - type , Folbp1 + / – , Folbp2 + / – and Folbp2 – / – dams . When dams were maintained on a normal rodent diet , the plasma folate concentrations differed between Folbp1 and Folbp2 heterozygotes . The average plasma folic acid concentration of Folbp1 + / – dams was 101 nM , signiﬁcantly less than that of Folbp2 heterozygotes , which averaged 185 nM ( Table 2 ; P < 0 . 05 ) . There were no signiﬁ - cant differences in the folic acid concentrations between wild - type dams and Folbp2 mutants ( Table 2 ; P > 0 . 05 ) . When dams were maintained on a reduced folic acid diet for two weeks , the mean plasma folic acid concentrations were signiﬁcantly reduced com - pared with their corresponding mean values from dams on a nor - mal folate diet ( Table 2 ; P < 0 . 05 ) . Folbp2 heterozygotes maintained the highest circulating folic acid concentrations under these conditions ( 17 nM ) , which was signiﬁcantly greater than the levels in the other three genotypes ( P < 0 . 05 ) . We next determined plasma homocysteine concentrations in non - pregnant wild - type , Folbp1 + / – , Folbp2 + / – and Folbp2 – / – dams . When the dams were maintained on a normal rodent diet , the plasma homocysteine concentrations did not differ signiﬁ - cantly between any of the genotypes , averaging 1 . 4 – 6 µ M ( Table 2 ; P > 0 . 05 ) . When the dams were maintained on a reduced folic acid diet for two weeks , the mean plasma homocysteine con - centrations were signiﬁcantly increased compared with corre - sponding mean values obtained from dams on a normal folate diet ( Table 2 ; P < 0 . 05 ) . Folbp1 + / – mice had the highest homocys - teine concentrations under these conditions ( 30 µ M ) , whereas wild - type dams ( 7 . 5 µ M ) had levels signiﬁcantly lower than those observed in the other genotypes ( P < 0 . 05 ) . We wondered if providing Folbp1 + / – dams with high doses of folate would protect the developing nullizygous embryos from lethal malformations .

The dams were killed on E18 , and fetuses collected and genotyped . In the absence of supplemental folic acid , 100 % of the nullizygous embryos developed abnormally and died by E10 ( Table 1 ) . Of the 70 E18 fetuses for which genotypes were determined , 12 phenotypically normal fetuses were Folbp1 nullizygotes ( Table 3 ) . There was a single Folbp1 – / – embryo with a neural tube defect ( Table 3 ) . Although phenotypically abnormal , this ani - mal survived well beyond the gestational timepoint at which Folbp1 – / – embryos usually die . The supplemental folic acid effectively rescued the normal phenotype in a significant per - centage of the embryos lacking a functional Folbp1 ( P < 0 . 05 ) . The presence of an uncorrected isolated NTD demonstrates that nullizygous Folbp1 embryos have abnormal NTC . The targeted disruption of Folbp1 altered critical embry - ological events in nullizygous embryos that were incompatible with normal morphogenesis and lethal in utero , thereby sup - porting the hypothesis that Folbp1 is essential for intrauterine viability . Folbp1 supplies the proper amount of folate to tis - sues at critical times during embryogenesis by concentrating it and delivering it to the cytoplasm 7 . The maintenance of proper fetal folate levels depends on the presence of active Folbp1 in trophoblast cells . Some tissues may have high meta - bolic folate requirements during development , depending on Folbp1 to retrieve adequate amounts of the vitamin from the fetal plasma . A deficiency in plasma folate might cause fetal homocysteine levels to rise to levels known to be terato - genic 22 , 23 . When homocysteine - treated avian embryos were provided with supplemental folate , congenital defects no longer occurred and homocysteine tissue levels declined 23 . These results , coupled with evidence from epidemiological studies 24 , suggest that elevated homocysteine levels are a sig - nificant risk factor for birth defects , particularly neural tube defects . Supplemental folic acid is highly effective in rescuing embryos in epidemiological and in experimental systems , with the benefit likely derived from a reduction in tissue homocys - teine concentrations . The cause of the embryonic lethality observed in the non - folate supplemented Folbp1 – / – embryos remains uncertain . Either inherent defects in morphogenesis or embryonic - maternal nutritional interactions via the extra - embryonic vas - culature are likely involved . During early development , the survival of the embryo is largely dependent on the formation and maintenance of the yolk sac circulation . When this is compromised , so too is embryonic growth and develop - ment 25 . Folbp1 nullizygotes were all severely growth retarded and may have malformations similar to those observed in other mutant mice 26 , 27 ( Mash2 , Gata2 , Gata3 and Ets2 ) . The abnormalities occurring in embryos lacking Folbp1 affirm that the high - affinity uptake of folate by cells is important to the folate homeostasis of the entire animal . Given that the specific biochemical reactions that are folate dependent remain to be elucidated , Folbp1 – / – animals will be a valuable model system for studying how this receptor is able to provide sufficient folate to sustain normal development . Methods Cloning of Folbp1 and Folbp2 and targeting construct . A bacteriophage Pl library ( Genome Systems ) prepared from the inbred mouse strain 129 / Sv genomic DNA was screened by PCR with primers speciﬁc for exon 5 of mouse Folbp2 ( 5´ – AAGGTCAGCAACTACAGCAGAGGG – 3´ and 3´ – AGC - CATAATGACAGCACTGGGG – 5´ ) . We identiﬁed 3 positive clones contain - ing 80 – 100 - kb inserts . As Folbp1 and Folbp2 are closely linked , the clones containing Folbp2 were also probed for Folbp1 using PCR with primers spe - ciﬁc for exon IV ( 5´ – TCCTGCCATCCCTTCACCTTCTAC – 3´ and 3´ – ATC ACCCAGAGCAGCACTAAGGAC – 5´ ) . All three Pl clones contained both genes . We subcloned a 6 - kb Sac I - Xho I fragment of Folbp2 containing exons 3 , 4 and 5 , and an 8 . 5 - kb Xba 1 - Hin dIII fragment of Folbp1 , containing exons 2 , 3 and 4 , into plasmid Bluescript ( pBS , Stratagene ) . Targeting con - structs were made by inserting the neomycin phosphotransferase ( neo ) gene into exon 3 of Folbp2 ( data not shown ) and exon 2 of Folbp1 . Cell culture and electroporation . We used ES cell line E14TG2a ( a gift from B . Koller ) for all experiments . Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modi - ﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum , 2 - mercaptoethanol ( 0 . 1 mM ) and glutamine ( 2 mM ; ES medium ) on embryonic ﬁbroblast feeder layers as described 28 . Cells were electroporated essentially as described 28 using linearized DNA ( 2 – 5 nM ) . We plated elec - troporated cells at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells per 10 - cm plate . We replaced the ES medium with medium containing G418 ( 150 – 200 µ g / ml ; Gibco BRL ) 24 h after electroporation . Screening for homologous recombinants . We identiﬁed ES cells carrying a gene disrupted by homologous recombination by genomic Southern - blot analysis . Brieﬂy , 10 – 14 d after electroporation and selection in G418 media , individual colonies were picked , expanded and genomic DNA iso - lated . We analysed genomic DNA from 102 clones of Folbp2 and 149 clones of Folbp1 by Southern - blot analysis . Analysis of 102 colonies electropora - ted with the Folbp2 targeting construct identiﬁed 9 colonies as targeted using Hin dIII , Bgl ll and Nde I digests . Similarly , from 148 colonies electro - porated with the Folbp1 targeting construct , 6 were identiﬁed as targeted using Apa I and Nde l digests . Generation of germline chimaeras . We generated chimaeras as described 28 . Animals classiﬁed as chimaeric by coat colour were mated with inbred C57BL / 6J dams . DNA samples were isolated from tails of ES cell - derived animals using the Puregene reagents ( Gentra System ) , and were analysed for the presence of a disrupted Folbp2 or Folbp1 by Southern - blot analysis . Germline chimaeras were identiﬁed for both Folbp1 and Folbp2 targeted alleles . Heterozygous offspring were maintained to adulthood and brother - sister matings were initiated to generate homozygous mutants . Genotype assignments . Adult genotyping was performed by genomic Southerns using diagnostic restriction fragments . For genotyping of em - bryonic tissues , phenotype of embryos was recorded , malformations pho - tographed , the cephalic component saved for histological examination and the remainder of the embryos used for DNA isolation . DNA was isolated using the Puregene ( Gentra Systems ) DNA isolation kit procedure and sub - jected to PCR analysis using primers to exon 2 and neo in Folbp1 or exon 3 and neo in Folbp2 . Primer sequences were : 5´ – AAGTGCAAGGCTGCAT - GTGG – 3´ and 5´ – CATTCCGATGTCATAGTTCCGC – 3´ for identiﬁcation of endogenous Folbp1 ; 5´ – CTTGGGTGGAGAGGCTATTC – 3´ and 5´ – TGC ATTCCGATGTCATAGTTCCG – 3´ for the identiﬁcation of the mutant Folbp1 allele ; 5´ – TGTGTGAGGCAGGGAAGAAGTG – 3´ and 5´ – TGGCTG - GTGTTGACTGAGCAAC – 3´ for identiﬁcation of the endogenous Folbp2 Table 3 • Folate supplementation of Folbp1 + / – dams Embryonic genotype at E18 No .

Plasma folic acid and homocysteine determinations . Plasma folic acid and homocysteine concentrations were determined in no less than ten wild - type , Folbp1 + / – , Folbp2 + / – or Folbp2 – / – dams . The animals were maintained on either a standard rodent diet ( HarlanTekLad ) or one that was 90 % depleted of folic acid ( Harlan Teklad TD95247 diet ) for a minimum of two weeks . In addition , the animals on the depleted folic acid diet were treated with a 1 % solution of sulfathiozole in their drinking water to facilitate the folate depletion . The monoglutamate forms of folate were separated and quantiﬁed an HPLC assay technique on a Waters Baseline 810 Chromatog - raphy workstation with a variable wavelength UV - spectrophotometer set at 280 nm and a Perkin - Elmer integrator . We determined homocysteine con - centrations using an assay protocol 29 in which the plasma was initially treated with sodium bromohydride to reduce the disulﬁde bonds and the liberated thiols were derivatized with monobromombimane . The deriva - tized sample was injected onto a cation - exchange column , from which the homocysteine derivative was directed by column switching into a cyclo - hexyl silica column . The homocysteine derivative was then top - concentrat - ed on the silica column and eluted with a steep gradient of methanol . The assay was performed on the Waters Baseline 810 Chromatography worksta - tion with a lower level of detection set at less than 2 pmol ( ref . 29 ) . Ribonuclease protection assay . Ribonuclease protection assays were car - ried out as described 30 . Maternal folate supplementation . Pregnant Folbp1 + / – dams were placed on folate supplementation two weeks before the ﬁrst attempt at mating . The dams were orally intubated each morning with folinic acid ( 25 mg / kg ; Sig - ma ) . The vitamin was dissolved in distilled water and administered in a volume of 0 . 10 ml per 10 g of body weight . The treatment continued until the time the dam was killed on E18 .
