Received 9 June 1997 ; accepted 18 June 1997 A set of yeast strains based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C in which commonly used selectable marker genes are deleted by design based on the yeast genome sequence has been constructed and analysed . These strains minimize or eliminate the homology to the corresponding marker genes in commonly used vectors without signiﬁcantly a V ecting adjacent gene expression . Because the homology between commonly used auxotrophic marker gene segments and genomic sequences has been largely or completely abolished , these strains will also reduce plasmid integration events which can interfere with a wide variety of molecular genetic applications . We also report the construction of new members of the pRS400 series of vectors , containing the kanMX , ADE2 and MET15 genes . (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

This is particularly true with regard to DNA transformation because there is no background of revertants to sort through ; any organism that acquires the wild - type phenotype is by deﬁnition a transformant . A problem with most deletion alleles is that they rarely precisely a V ect a single gene ; there may be ‘collateral’ e V ects on one or more adjacent genes that can confound genetic analysis . The availability of whole - genome sequence information together with modern recombinant technologies like the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) allows the precise design of deletions that are much less likely to have such problems . We have designed a strategy exploiting these technologies to create a set of precise deletion alleles of commonly used auxotrophic markers in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . As additional complete genomes are sequenced , this strategy can be used to create high quality deletion alleles in other organisms . Traditionally the yeast S . cerevisiae has served as one of the best genetically tractable eukaryotic systems . Researchers have for years been able to disrupt genes in yeast in order to study their mutant phenotypes ; however , the techniques used for gene disruption have had limitations . First , the gene to be disrupted had to be cloned . Second , because available restriction sites were used to delete a portion of the gene and insert a selectable marker , 5 (cid:42) or 3 (cid:42) fragments of the gene were often * Correspondence to : J .

A method has recently been developed that allows complete deletion of the gene of interest and its replacement with an auxo - trophic marker gene ( Baudin et al . , 1993 ; Lorenz et al . , 1995 ) . This procedure , called PCR - mediated gene disruption , requires only knowledge of the genomic sequence of the gene of interest , allowing for precise gene deletion prior to its cloning and immediate study of the null phenotype . Along with the availability of the entire S . cerevisiae genomic sequence , the method of PCR - mediated gene dis - ruption has changed the face of yeast genetics , enabling researchers to quickly assess a gene’s possible function through evaluation of the null phenotype , and to e Y ciently tackle the more complex problems inherent in the analysis of multi - gene families . Like its predecessor method , one - step gene disruption ( Rothstein , 1983 ) , PCR - mediated gene disruption relies on the fact that homologous recombination in yeast can be e Y ciently mediated by linear fragments of DNA . The method requires two (cid:50) 60 nucleotide ( nt ) PCR primers ; the 20 nts of sequence at the 3 (cid:42) ends of each primer is speciﬁc for the ampliﬁcation of an auxotrophic marker gene , and the 40 nts of sequence at the 5 (cid:42) ends is identical to the left and right genomic sequence ﬂanking the gene of interest . Using these targeting primers , the auxotrophic marker gene is ampliﬁed and the resulting PCR product contains the marker gene and 40 bp of genomic DNA sequence to the left and right of the gene deletion of interest . This product is then transformed into yeast , and stable transformants are selected on appropriate medium . These transformants include those cells in which two crossover events occurred , one between each end of the 40 bp target sequences of the PCR product and the corresponding genomic DNA sequence , thereby replacing the gene of interest with the auxotrophic marker gene . A limitation of this method has been that the genomic alleles of many of the most commonly used auxotrophic markers are point mutations , small internal deletions , or Ty1 insertions , and therefore retain large regions of homology to the internal selectable marker segment of the PCR product . This results in a high background of positive transformants in which the marker gene has replaced the auxotrophic mutation by marker locus gene conversion , leaving the gene of interest una V ected . This problem is circumvented by use of the set of ‘designer’ deletion strains we have made , in which some commonly used auxotrophic marker genes have been completely deleted . These strains eliminate the background of undesired marker gene convertants . Because the homology between commonly used auxotrophic marker gene segments and genomic sequences has been largely or completely abolished , these strains will also reduce plasmid integration events which can inter - fere with a wide variety of molecular genetic applications . We have also constructed a designer deletion allele of the MET15 gene , a selectable marker gene which is useful both because it is counterselectable and because it can be used as a colony color marker ( Cost and Boeke , 1996 ) . Additionally , we have increased the repertoire of the pRS plasmids by constructing new versions containing the kanMX marker ( Wach et al . , 1994 ) , ADE2 and MET15 markers . Finally , we have designed universal PCR primers for PCR - mediated gene disruption . This strategy allows the ampliﬁcation of each of the auxotrophic marker genes found in the pRS set of plasmids ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . Thus , the same primers can be used to amplify any of the auxotrophic marker genes , allowing for much greater ﬂexibility in the design of gene knockout experiments . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains and media The yeast strains are all directly descended from FY2 ( Winston et al . , 1995 ) , which is itself a direct descendant of S288C , and are described in Table 1 . The genealogy of the strains in this paper is summarized in Figure 1 . Media used were as described ( Boeke et al . , 1984 ; Rose et al . , 1990 ) , or as described in Table 2 for scoring the met15 marker . E Y cient sporulation of diploids required growth as a patch on freshly poured GNA pre - sporulation plates ( 5 % glucose , 3 % Difco nutrient broth , 1 % Difco yeast extract , 2 % agar ) for 1 day at 30 (cid:41) C prior to transfer to liquid sporulation medium ( 1 % potassium acetate , 0·005 % zinc acet - ate ) . Typically , a generous matchhead of cells was resuspended in 2 ml of liquid sporulation medium . Sporulation cultures were incubated on a roller wheel for 1 day at 25 (cid:41) C followed by 3 – 5 days at 30 (cid:41) C and could be readily dissected . In general , sporulation e Y ciencies were of the order of 20 – 30 % ( pre - growth of diploids on YPD instead of GNA resulted in somewhat lower sporulation e Y ciencies ) . 116 c . b . brachmann et al .

Oligos MET15 - 1 ( cggggtaccAAGTTCTCGTCGAATGCTAGG ) and MET15 - 2 ( cgcggatccTGCCAACCACCACA G TTCCCC ) were used to amplify a 1034 bp region to the left of MET15 and oligos MET15 - 3 ( cgcggatccTCAGATATAGTCGGATTGCCC ) and MET15 - 4 ( cggctggagctcGGTGTTGACACC TTCTCCGC ) were used to amplify a 2084 bp region to the right of MET15 . In all cases , the left fragment included a Kpn I site at its 5 (cid:42) end and a Bam HI site at its 3 (cid:42) end , and the right fragment included a Bam HI site at its 5 (cid:42) end and a Sac I site at its 3 (cid:42) end . Plasmids pJL164 contains the Bgl II – Bam HI genomic fragment containing URA3 cloned into the Bam HI and Xho I sites , respectively , of pRS305 ; the URA3 ORF has been deleted from this construct by removing a 1·1 kb segment from Hin dIII to Sma I , leaving a Sma I linker at the deletion junction . pAD1 is pRS406 containing the left and right ﬂanking fragments of LEU2 . The left fragment was ﬁrst digested with Kpn I and Bam HI and the right fragment was digested with Bam HI and Sac I . Both fragments were then puriﬁed and ligated into pRS406 linearized with Kpn I and Sac I . Correct 3 piece ligations were conﬁrmed by restriction diges - tion . Plasmids pAD2 ( pRS406 containing the left and right ﬂanking fragments of LYS2 ) and pAD4 ( pRS406 containing the left and right ﬂanking fragments of MET15 ) were constructed in an iden - tical manner . These plasmids are available from ATCC ( Table 3 ) . New pRS plasmids In these plasmids , the composition , orientation and position of insertion of the CEN / ARS and 2 (cid:236) cassettes are identical to those described by Sikorski and Hieter ( 1989 ) and Christianson et al .

All sites indicated on the restriction maps were veriﬁed by digestion . Construction of the MET15 plasmids , pRS401 , pRS411 and pRS421 The pRS40X series precur - sor plasmid pJK142 ( Keeney and Boeke , 1994 ) was digested with Nde I , blunted and the minimal complementing 1621 bp Ehe I – Sca I fragment of the MET15 genomic locus was inserted to create pRS401 ( Ehe I recognizes the same site as Nar I but leaves a blunt end ) . pRS401 was digested with Aat II , blunted , and a 514 bp Hin cII – Pst I ( blunt ) fragment of pRSS84 containing the CEN6 / ARSH4 cassette ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) inserted to create pRS411 . pRS401 was digested with Aat II , blunted , and the 1345 bp Hpa I – Nde I ( blunt ) frag - ment of YEp24 containing the 2 (cid:236) ori ( A form ; Christianson et al . , 1992 ) was inserted to create pRS421 . Construction of the ADE2 plasmids , pRS402 , pRS412 and pRS422 pJK142 was digested with Nde I , blunted , and a 2252 bp Bgl II ( blunted ) fragment of pASZ11 ( kindly provided by Patrick Linder ) containing a minimal complementing region of the ADE2 genomic locus ( Stotz and Linder , 1990 ) was inserted to create pRS402 . The CEN6 / ARSH4 plasmid pRS412 and the 2 (cid:236) plas - mid pRS422 were created by ligation of the 1246 bp Apa LI fragment of pRS402 and the 3781 bp Apa LI fragment of pRS402 with either the 1011 bp CEN6 / ARSH4 Apa LI fragment of pRS411 or the 1837 bp 2 (cid:236) Apa LI fragment of pRS421 . It should be noted that these ADE2 clones bear a silent A to G mutation at nucleotide 1243 of the GenBank sequence designed to destroy a Bgl II restriction site ( Stotz and Linder , 1990 ) . Construction of the kanMX4 pRS400 plasmid pJK142 was digested with Nde I , blunted , and a 1483 bp Sma I to Eco RV fragment of pFA6A ( Wach et al . , 1994 ) containing kanMX4 was inserted , and kanamycin - resistant transformants were isolated . The initial clone was found to contain two copies of the vector sequence ligated in tandem with a single copy of kanMX4 . This clone was digested with Aat II and re - ligated to create pRS400 which contains a single copy of the vector and kanMX4 . Construction of markerless pRS vectors The CEN6 / ARSH4 plasmid pGC25 and the 2 (cid:236) plasmid pGC26 were created by ligation of the 1246 bp Apa LI fragment of pRS402 and the 1527 bp Apa LI fragment of pJK142 with either the 1011 bp CEN6 / ARSH4 Apa LI fragment of pRS411 or the 1837 bp 2 (cid:236) Apa LI fragment of pRS421 . These plasmids contain either the CEN6 / ARSH4 or the 2 (cid:236) sequence , but lack a selectable marker for use in S . cerevisiae . pGC25 ( CEN ) and pGC26 ( 2 (cid:236) ) should be useful as the basis for a further extension of the pRS line to encompass an even greater diversity of markers . Introduction of gene disruption mutations into yeast and strain history We introduced the ade2 (cid:196) : : hisG mutation into YPH681 ( a direct descendant of FY2 ) to create YCB436 using the previously described ADE2 disrupter p (cid:196) ADE2 ( Aparicio et al . , 1991 ) , which results in deletion of the ADE2 ORF ( with the exception of six C - terminal amino acids ) and replacement with a copy of the bacterial hisG gene . To create the correct starting strains for the designer deletions , YCB436 was crossed to BY378 and the resulting diploid was sporulated . Two spores from this cross , YCB451 and YCB452 were then gene converted to URA3 + by transformation with the 13 kb Eco RI fragment containing URA3 + ( derived from pSK179 provided by S . Kunes ) and selection for Ura + , thus creating strains BY397 and BY398 , respectively . To introduce the ura3 (cid:196) 0 deletion , the Spe I – Xho I fragment from pJL164 was transformed into these two strains , transform - ants were grown for 1 day at 30 (cid:41) C on YPD plates to allow loss of pre - existing Ura3 protein and development of the FOA R phenotype ( Ronne and Rothstein , 1988 ) and then replica - plated to 5 - FOA plates . 5 - FOA R colonies were identiﬁed and patched onto YPD . These were screened for URA3 deletions by a reversion analysis . The YPD plates were replica - plated to SC (cid:34) ura plates and irradi - ated with UV - light at 100 J / m 2 using a Stratalinker ( Stratagene ; setting of 100 (cid:236) J (cid:35) 100 / cm 2 ) . Follow - ing irradiation , plates were wrapped in foil to prevent photoreactivation and incubated for several days at 30 (cid:41) C . Using this test , ura3 (cid:196) 0 dele - tions were identiﬁed by their inability to revert to 120 c . b . brachmann et al . (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) Ura + , whereas point mutations reverted . Finally , correct ura3 (cid:196) 0 deletions in strains BY399 and BY401 were conﬁrmed by Southern blot analysis ( Ausubel et al . , 1987 ) . Figure 2 describes the method used to introduce the remaining designer deletion mutations . First , deleter plasmids pAD1 , pAD2 and pAD4 were linearized at unique sites within each right ﬂanking fragment ( pAD1 with Sal I , pAD2 and pAD4 with Cla I ) and transformed into the ura3 (cid:196) 0 strains . Genomic integrants were selected on SC (cid:34) ura plates . Ura + colonies were replica - plated to YPD plates to allow recombinational loss of the integrated URA3 marker and pRS406 backbone and then replica - plated to 5 - FOA plates to identify those that had become Ura (cid:34) . 5 - FOA - resistant colonies were picked and checked for loss of the targeted auxotrophic marker by replica - plating to SC (cid:34) leu , SC (cid:34) lys or lead - containing plates ( met15 strains are brown on these plates ) . Finally , deletions were conﬁrmed by Southern analysis . The pAD1 transformation was performed in strain BY399 to create BY404 , the pAD2 transformation was performed in strain BY401 to create BY406 and the pAD4 transformation was performed in strain BY406 to create BY411 . To create a set of strains consisting of a varying array of deletion alleles , BY411 ( MAT (cid:225) ura3 (cid:196) met15 (cid:196) 0 trp1 (cid:196) 63 his3 (cid:196) 200 ade2 (cid:196) lys2 (cid:196) 0 ) was crossed to BY379 ( MAT a his3 (cid:196) 200 ) and a spore was selected with the following genotype : MAT (cid:225) met15 (cid:196) 0 his3 (cid:196) 200 lys2 (cid:196) 0 . This strain , BY413 , was mated to BY404 ( MAT a ura3 (cid:196) leu2 (cid:196) 0 trp1 (cid:196) 63 his3 (cid:196) 200 ade2 (cid:196) ) . Tetrad dissection of four result - ing diploids yielded an unexpected result : two spores of each tetrad grew slowly on rich medium , irrespective of genotype . Suspecting that these might have resulted from a single nuclear petite mutation , we tested all tetrads for growth on glycerol - and ethanol - containing rich medium ( petite strains cannot utilize these carbon sources and so fail to grow ) . We found that these slow - growing spores did not exhibit a petite phenotype since all spores grew on these plates . We back - crossed one of the faster - growing spores from this cross ( BY418 ; MAT (cid:225) ura3 (cid:196) met15 (cid:196) 0 trp1 (cid:196) 63 his3 (cid:196) 200 ade2 (cid:196) lys2 (cid:196) 0 leu2 (cid:196) 0 ) to the parent FY4 ( MAT a ) prototrophic strain . All spores obtained from tetrad dissection of this cross grew equally well , indicating that the mutation causing slow growth observed in the previous cross had been eliminated . The strain history is presented schematically in Figure 1 ) . Northern analysis of ﬂanking genes RNA was prepared from 10 ml of a log - phase culture ( OD 600 = 1 – 2 ) grown in YPD at 30 (cid:41) C . The cells were washed once in water and resuspended in 0·3 ml RNA bu V er ( 0·1 m - NaCl , 0·1 m - Tris base , 0·03 m - EDTA , 1 % w / v N - lauryl sarcosine , pH 8·9 – 9·0 ) and frozen at (cid:34) 70 (cid:41) C . Upon thawing , 0·4 g glass beads , 0·15 ml phenol and 0·15 ml chloro - form were added , and the cells were broken by vortexing for 10 min . Following a short spin to separate the phases , 1 / 10th volume 3 m - NaOAc and 2·5 volumes ice - cold EtOH were added to the aqueous layer to precipitate the nucleic acids ( mostly RNA ) . The precipitate was dissolved in 100 (cid:236) l of loading bu V er ( 50 % formamide , 25 % water , 15 % formaldehyde , 10 % 10 (cid:35) MOPS— 0·2 m - morpholinopropane - sulfonic acid , 0·05 m - NaOAc , 0·01 m - Na 2 EDTA ; pH adjusted to 7·0 with NaOH ) . 10 (cid:236) g RNA was ﬁrst heated to 55 (cid:41) C for 15 min and then electrophoresed on a 1·2 % agarose / formaldehyde gel as described ( Ausubel et al . , 1987 . The separated RNA was transferred to Genescreen Plus ( ICN ) and hybridized to the appropriate probe ( Ausubel et al . , 1987 ) and Genescreen Plus protocol . PCR protocol for PCR - mediated gene disruptions Using primers consisting of 40 nts of gene - speciﬁc sequence at the 5 (cid:42) end followed by : 5 (cid:42) - CTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG - 3 - (cid:42) ( left primer ) and 5 (cid:42) - AGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC - 3 (cid:42) ( right primer ) , any auxotrophic marker can be ampliﬁed from a pRS40X integrating plasmid using the following PCR protocol : 94 (cid:41) C 2 min , [ 94 (cid:41) C 1 min , 55 (cid:41) C 1 min , 72 (cid:41) C 2 min ] (cid:35) 10 cycles , [ 94 (cid:41) C 1 min , 65 (cid:41) C 1 min , 72 (cid:41) C 2 min ] (cid:35) 20 cycles , 72 (cid:41) C 10 min . This protocol usually results in ampliﬁcation of only the speciﬁc product . If yields are high enough , it is possible to directly transform yeast , but generally , 10 - fold concentration by EtOH precipitation before transformation is desirable . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A compilation of commonly found alleles of auxotrophic marker genes To develop a strategy for construction of designer deletion strains , we ﬁrst had to compile relevant information for existing auxotrophic selectable marker alleles . Many commonly used strains contain mutations in the auxotrophic 121 designer deletion yeast strains and new yeast vectors (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) marker genes—namely , point mutations or small internal deletions which are not conducive to successful PCR - mediated gene disruption . These auxotrophic loci retain extensive homology with the prototrophic marker gene segment of the PCR product , leading to high levels of mistargeting . We have compiled a table of many of these com - monly used alleles ( Table 4 ) which should be useful in determining a strain’s adaptability for PCR - mediated gene disruption . Table 4 .

(cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) PCR - mediated gene disruption is variably suc - cessful in its degree of targeting the locus of interest , even when complete deletion alleles corresponding to the marker gene being intro - duced are used . The reason for this variability in e Y ciency is not entirely clear but appears to be related primarily to the targeting sequences that ﬂank the target gene ( Q . Feng and J . D . B . , un - published data ) , and to a lesser extent to the nature of the disrupting auxotrophic marker . It is import - ant to note that the commonly used segment of LEU2 ( the Xho I – Sal I fragment found in the pRS vectors ) contains 240 bp of (cid:228) ( Ty2 LTR ) sequence at its 5 (cid:42) end . This may lead to a higher frequency of mistargeting than with the other auxotrophic markers . Complete deletion alleles of URA3 , LEU2 , LYS2 and MET15 Commonly used strains of the S288C lineage contain only four auxotrophic alleles that are well - deﬁned deletions , namely his3 (cid:196) 200 , leu2 (cid:196) 1 , trp1 (cid:196) 1 , and trp1 (cid:196) 63 . Both the his3 (cid:196) 200 and trp1 (cid:196) 1 mutations completely remove the protein coding regions , whereas trp1 (cid:196) 63 leaves intact the 3 (cid:42) end of the gene and leu2 (cid:196) 1 is an internal deletion ( Table 4 ) . All of these mutations except leu2 (cid:196) 1 work well for the method of PCR - mediated gene disruption , resulting in proper gene disrup - tions 30 – 100 % of the time . Thus , new designer deletion alleles of TRP1 and HIS3 have not been constructed . However , PCR - mediated gene disrup - tions using other commonly used auxotrophic alleles have been di Y cult to obtain because of the high background of gene conversion . For this reason we set out to construct an isogenic set of strains in which URA3 , LYS2 , LEU2 and MET15 were completely deleted . The strategy for the designer deletion alleles ( designated (cid:196) 0 ) is depicted in Figure 2 . Approxi - mately 1 kb ‘left’ and ‘right’ ﬂanking regions of the auxotrophic marker to be deleted were cloned into a URA3 integrating vector . Linearization of the resulting deleter plasmid within the right ﬂanking sequence and transformation of a ura3 (cid:196) 0 strain results in integration of the plasmid at the auxo - trophic marker locus . Subsequent recombination between the duplicated left or right ﬂanks results in 5 - FOA resistance ( due to excision of the URA3 plasmid ) and leads to acquisition of the appropriate auxotrophy ( in principle , 50 % of the time ) . Because this strategy involves integration of a URA3 containing plasmid , it was important that our starting strain was not only Ura (cid:34) , but also lacked sequences overlapping with the plasmid URA3 gene . To completely delete URA3 , the plasmid pJL164 , containing a genomic 4·0 kb Bgl II – Bam HI fragment in which the region from Hin dIII to Sma I encompassing the URA3 gene has been deleted ( Figure 3 ) , was digested with Spe I and Xho I to liberate a DNA fragment spanning the deletion ( Table 3 ) . This was transformed into the URA3 + strains BY397 and BY398 and Ura (cid:34) colonies were selected on 5 - FOA . Reversion tests and Southern blotting conﬁrmed the acqui - sition of the ura3 (cid:196) 0 allele in strains BY399 and BY401 . All four designer deletion plasmids completely remove the open reading frame encoding the ap - propriate auxotrophic marker . They also remove several hundred bp of 5 (cid:42) ﬂanking region , and as much 3 (cid:42) ﬂanking region as is practical . Ideally , there should be no homology between the marker segment in the plasmid to be used and the deletion in the chromosome . In two cases ( ura3 and met15 ) it was possible to remove all homology between plasmid marker segment and chromosomal de - letion . The details of the design of each deletion were dictated by what was known about the nature of ﬂanking genes ; often , as at the 3 (cid:42) end of LYS2 , there was not much room to maneuver due to the proximity of the adjacent gene ( Figure 3 ) . Both MET15 and LEU2 are ﬂanked by tRNA genes and (cid:228) elements and in the case of LEU2 , an entire Ty2 element . Because the segment of LEU2 commonly used in cloning vectors contains part of this Ty2 element as well as a tRNA Leu gene , it was necess - ary to delete the Ty2 element , the tRNA gene , and LEU2 in order to eliminate overlap with the vector segment , at least at one end of the marker gene . Thus the leu2 (cid:196) 0 allele is considerably larger than the rest . No unusual phenotypes have resulted from this deletion . To create the leu2 (cid:196) 0 and lys2 (cid:196) 0 strains , pAD1 was linearized with Sal I and pAD2 with Cla I ( Table 3 and Figure 2 ) and transformed into BY399 and BY401 respectively . Ura + colonies were patched onto SC (cid:34) ura , replica - plated to YPD ( to allow loss of the URA3 + and ﬂanking vector sequences ) and replica - plated to 5 - FOA plates . Papillae from the 5 - FOA plates were streaked onto YPD and replica - plated to either SC (cid:34) leu or SC (cid:34) lys to identify auxotrophs ( Figure 2 ) . Of 24 5 - FOA R papillae from the pAD1 123 designer deletion yeast strains and new yeast vectors (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) transformation , three were Leu (cid:34) , and of 24 5 - FOA R papillae from the pAD2 transformation , six were Lys (cid:34) . The deletions were conﬁrmed by genomic Southern analysis ( Figure 4 ) . The met15 (cid:196) 0 mutation was introduced into BY406 ( the lys2 (cid:196) 0 derivative ) in a similar fashion . Plasmid pAD4 was linearized with Cla I and trans - formed . Following 5 - FOA selection , candidate strains were streaked onto YPD plates and replica - plated to lead - containing plates . When grown on these plates met15 strains are brown in color , identifying those strains in which recombi - national loss of the URA3 + and vector sequences had resulted in a Met (cid:34) phenotype . The met15 (cid:196) 0 allele was conﬁrmed by Southern analysis ( Figure 4 ) . Using the ADE2 disrupter plasmid p (cid:196) ADE2 ( Aparicio et al . , 1991 , the ade2 (cid:196) : : : hisG : : URA3 : : hisG ( originally referred to as ade2 (cid:196) by Aparicio et al . ) mutation was introduced into these strains ; these were converted to ade2 (cid:196) : : hisG alleles by plating on 5 - FOA as above . Since six C - terminal Figure 2 . Method of construction of designer deletion strains . An example is given in which LYS2 + is deleted to create lys2 (cid:196) 0 . The LYS2 ORF is indicated by a white oval and the hatched regions indicate left and right ﬂanking sequences . Lines with arrows indicate oligonucleotide primers for PCR - ampliﬁcation of the ﬂanking regions , and the restriction sites engineered into these oligos are indicated by K , Kpn I ; B , Bam HI or S , Sac I . Using these oligos , the ﬂanking regions are PCR - ampliﬁed , cut with the indicated enzymes and cloned into pRS406 to create a deleter plasmid ; in this case , pAD2 . pAD2 is then linearized at the unique Cla I ( C ) site in the right ﬂanking region and transformed into yeast . Integration of the linearized vector within the genomic LYS2 right region results in the conﬁguration of sequences shown in the middle panel of the diagram . Recombination between the two left regions results in deletion of the LYS2 + and vector sequences . Not shown , but equally likely , is recombination between the two right regions which results in restoration of the wild - type LYS2 + allele . 124 c . b . brachmann et al . (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) amino acids remain of the ADE2 ORF , the ade2 (cid:196) : : hisG mutation is not technically a designer deletion , and it has been shown to be useful in PCR - mediated gene disruption ( D . Gottschling , pers . comm . ) . Because these strains are intended to be used for , among other things , the systematic genetic analysis of genes of unknown function , it was important to establish that expression of the ORFs neighboring the deleted auxotrophic markers was una V ected in these deletion strains . This seemed especially important because many yeast workers have found that two of the commonly used deletion alleles , his3 (cid:196) 200 and trp1 (cid:196) 1 , have ‘collateral’ phenotypes that are sometimes undesirable due to e V ects on adjacent genes . his3 (cid:196) 200 strains display an increased rate of petite formation , presumably due to e V ects on expression of the neighboring PET56 gene . trp1 (cid:196) 1 removes ARS1 ( with no obvious phenotype ) and partially disables the neighboring GAL3 gene by removing a portion of its UAS . Finally , both trp1 (cid:196) 63 and trp1 (cid:196) 1 strains share a cold - sensitivity phenotype which all Trp (cid:34) strains exhibit ( Singh and Manney , 1974 ) . It is impossible to totally rule out e V ects on ﬂanking genes but the deletions were designed to minimize the possibility of such e V ects . In the construction of the leu2 and met15 deletions , tRNA genes that are part of multigene families were removed in addition to the auxotrophic marker . The phenotypic consequence of this is likely to be minimal , based on experiences with other multi - gene tRNA families ( Bystro¨m and Fink , 1989 ; A r stro¨m and Bystro¨m , 1993 ) . All of the designer deletions remove marker genes that are ﬂanked by convergently transcribed neighboring genes ( Figure 3 ) ; e V ects on the ﬂanking genes are thus expected to be minimal . Nevertheless , the possibility of altered transcript sizes and transcrip - tional level of neighboring genes was investigated by Northern analysis . RNA was prepared from BY418 ( which has all four designer deletion mutations ) and FY2 ( the wild - type strain ) , and left and right ﬂanking probes ( Figure 3 ) were used to detect the transcription of neighboring ORFs ; in no case was the expression of a neighboring ORF signiﬁcantly a V ected ( Figure 5 ; compare the neigh - boring gene speciﬁc transcript with the Ty1 load - ing control transcript ) . However , our analyses did detect one minor but interesting expression pattern change . The LEU2 neighboring ORF , YCL17C ( reading toward LEU2 ) , appears to direct a major transcript and numerous larger minor transcripts . In the leu2 (cid:196) 0 strain , the overall levels of the transcripts are slightly reduced and in particular , the largest transcripts appear to be missing . Such an observation is consistent with the possibility that the larger transcripts normally terminate within the deleted region . A set of designer deletion strains To obtain strains with numerous di V erent com - binations of auxotrophic alleles , 206 tetrads were dissected from a cross between FY3 and BY418 ( Figure 1 ) . This cross gave (cid:50) 30 % sporula - tion and 96·5 % spore viability using the conditions described in Materials and Methods . A subset of the strains from this cross identiﬁed in Table 1 , which should prove generally useful to the yeast community , has been deposited with the ATCC . New pRS plasmids with ADE2 , MET15 and kanMX4 markers The pRS vector series is a set of S . cerevisiae shuttle plasmids that are in wide use . Much of their appeal derives from their small size , modular design , minimal length marker segments , useful polylinker and consistency of structure . Also , complete DNA sequence ﬁles exist for these plasmids , greatly facilitating construction and analysis of recombinant plasmids . The original set of pRS vectors ( the pRS300 series ) were based on pBluescript KS + ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) and included both integrating and centromere - containing versions ; the pRS400 series is based on pBSII SK + ( Stratagene ; Christianson et al . , 1992 ) and also includes 2 (cid:236) versions . This latter series is more generally useful for several reasons : ( 1 ) the lacZ (cid:225) - complementation is improved over the pRS300 series ; ( 2 ) the polylinker is ﬂanked by Bss HII sites , allowing a simple assessment of insert size to be carried out and facilitating swapping of inserts from one vector to another ; and ( 3 ) the pRS400 series is more complete , including integrating , CEN , and high copy versions . The ‘code’ for the pRS vectors is simple : the second digit ( 0 , 1 or 2 ) speciﬁes the plasmid type ( integrat - ing , CEN or 2 (cid:236) , respectively ) and the third digit speciﬁes the selectable marker ( see Table 5 ) . We constructed new integrating , CEN and 2 (cid:236) plasmids for use with the ade2 (cid:196) and met15 (cid:196) 0 strains ( Figure 6 ) . In all cases , the plasmid back - bone is identical to the pRS400 series of plasmids , and the selectable markers were inserted into the same restriction site as had been utilized for 125 designer deletion yeast strains and new yeast vectors (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) 126 c . b . brachmann et al . (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) the pRS plasmids ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ; Christianson et al . , 1992 ) . In the case of the ADE2 plasmids , pRS402 , pRS412 and pRS422 , the fragment inserted represents a minimal com - plementing fragment as previously determined by Stotz and Linder ( 1990 ) . For the MET15 plasmids , pRS401 , pRS411 and pRS421 , a minimal length complementing fragment as deﬁned by a com - plementation analysis ( Figure 7 ) . The Nar I – Sca I fragment was the smallest strongly - complementing fragment and was cloned into the pRS plasmid backbones . The ADE2 and the MET15 plasmids were demonstrated to fully complement the ade2 (cid:196) and met15 (cid:196) 0 mutations as judged by colony growth on appropriate selective media . In the course of these experiments we noted that unlike all of the other auxotrophic designer deletion markers , the met15 (cid:196) 0 strain eventually ( and at a low frequency ) spawns slow - growing pseudo - Met + papillae when replica - plated as a thick patch on YPD medium to SD plates . Such growth is maxi - mal at 22 (cid:41) C , drops dramatically at 25 (cid:41) C and decreases linearly from 30 – 37 (cid:41) C , where little growth is observed . These pseudo - Met + papillae are not true revertants because they form black colonies on lead plates , like the parental met15 mutant strain . Most importantly , these colonies do not grow when restreaked on methionine - free medium , so they are not true Met + cells . Our working hypothesis is that these colonies represent mutants that are more e Y cient at scavenging methionine or cysteine from adjacent cells . This phenomenon will be described in more detail elsewhere , but does not create much of a prac - tical problem . Using standard LiOAc transform - ation procedures , these pseudo - Met + colonies did not cause any detectable background ( i . e . no visible colonies on a control plate to which no pRS4X1 plasmid DNA had been added ) . In fact no colonies appeared on the no DNA plate even after 10 days of growth . Finally , we constructed the integrating plasmid pRS400 , which contains the kanMX4 gene ( Wach et al . , 1994 ) . This is useful for use as a template for PCR - mediated gene disruption . Available information on the Figure 4 . Genomic DNA blot analysis of deletion alleles . DNA was isolated from the wild - type strain FY5 ( + ) and the multiple deletion strain BY418 ( (cid:196) ) . Approximately 1 (cid:236) g of genomic DNA was digested with Bst XI ( LYS2 ) , Pst I ( LEU2 ) or Kpn I ( MET15 ) , and fractionated on a 1 % agarose gel . Follow - ing transfer to a nylon ﬁlter , each blot was probed with a gene - speciﬁc ﬂanking probe ( as depicted in Figure 3 ) : LYS2 , left ﬂank ; LEU2 , right ﬂank ; and MET15 , right ﬂank . Expected product sizes are : LYS2 , wild - type genomic Bst XI fragment is 4 kb and the deletion Bst XI fragment is 1·4 kb ; LEU2 , wild - type genomic Pst I fragment is 12 kb and the deletion Pst I fragment is 7·6 kb ; MET15 , wild - type genomic Kpn I fragment is 6·8 b and the deletion Kpn I fragment is 4·4 kb . The observed LEU2 fragment sizes do not agree with the expected ; this is probably because chromosome III sequence was not obtained from this strain background ( Oliver et al . , 1992 ) . However , the di V erence in size between the deleted and wild - type LEU2 fragments agrees with the sequence . DNA marker sizes are in kb as indicated . Figure 3 . Genomic structure of deletion alleles and overlap with vector segments . The genomic region encompassing each of the ﬁve deletions is presented as a six - phase ORF analysis . To the left of each are indicated the three possible reading frames of the plus and minus strands . Lines from the top to the bottom of each frame indicate stop codons in that frame , and lines from the middle to the bottom of each frame indicate methionine residues in that frame ( output is from the DNA Strider 1 . 2 ORF Map function ) . Each ORF is identiﬁed by its gene name or ORF designation , and above each diagram , tRNA and Ty elements have been identiﬁed . All nucleotide numbers are deﬁned by + 1 being assigned to the A of the ﬁrst ATG in the auxotrophic marker ORF to prevent possible confusion resulting from renumbering of sequences in databases . The bold line under each diagram indicates the extent of each deletion . Below this is a thin line indicating the extent of the fragment of genomic sequence encoding the auxotrophic marker cloned into the corresponding pRS vector . Finally , the left and right ﬂanking regions which were used as probes for the Southern and Northern analyses in this paper are indicated . In the cases of LEU2 , LYS2 and MET15 , these are identical to the left and right ﬂanking regions that were PCR - ampliﬁed for the deleter constructs ( Figure 2 ) . Note that the scale is the same for all regions except for the LEU2 region , which had to be compressed to accommodate the very large deletion which removed an adjacent Ty2 element as well as LEU2 itself . 127 designer deletion yeast strains and new yeast vectors (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) sequences and availability of the complete series of pRS400 series vectors is summarized in Table 5 . Universal primers for PCR - mediated gene disruption using pRS plasmid templates A pair of primer segments was designed which can be universally used to amplify any selectable marker from the pRS set of plasmids ( Figure 8 ) . Addition of 40 nts of sequence speciﬁc to the gene of interest at the 5 (cid:42) ends of the primers results in a single set of 60 nt primers which can be used to delete the gene of interest with either URA3 , TRP1 , HIS3 , LEU2 , LYS2 , ADE2 , MET15 or kanMX4 . We have used this strategy to disrupt a number of genes in our laboratories . Figure 5 . RNA blot analysis for e V ects on expression of neighboring genes . RNA was isolated from the wild - type strain FY5 ( + ) and the multiple deletion strain BY418 ( (cid:196) ) . Multiple samples containing 9·8 (cid:236) g total RNA from each strain were fractionated on a 1·2 % formaldehyde agarose gel . Following transfer to a nylon ﬁlter , the blot was cut into strips and each was probed with a gene - speciﬁc left ﬂank probe ( probes are indicated in Figure 3 ) . Following this , the blots were reprobed with gene - speciﬁc right probes . For all panels , the wild - type sample is presented on the left as indicated for LEU2 . In all cases , transcript sizes were consistent with the sizes of encoded ORFs or known transcripts ; the inferred identities of the transcripts are indicated below each panel . To allow comparison between samples , the Ty transcript is included as a loading control . Fortuitously , two left probes ( LEU2 and MET15 ) contained Ty LTR sequences . The LEU2 left probe was used to reprobe those blots in which the Ty1 transcript had not yet been visualized . It should be noted that based on the sequence no transcript was expected ( i . e . there were no known ORFs or genes ) to the left of leu2 (cid:196) 0 and no hybridizing bands were seen with this probe . 128 c . b . brachmann et al . (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) Other applications for the designer deletion strains and new plasmids Although we have focused on the application of PCR - mediated gene disruption in this paper , we envision that the designer deletion alleles will be the alleles of choice for a very wide range of applications . They are ideal as transformation markers because they cannot revert ( with the special exception of met15 noted above ) . The ability to knock out genes of interest by the PCR approach is enhanced by expanding the set of available markers in pRS vectors . This is especi - ally useful in the study of multigene families ( Brachmann et al . , 1995 ) many of which have been revealed by the completion of the S . cerevisiae genome sequence . By synthesizing a single pair of primers for each target gene of interest , the investigator has the ability to knock out a member of the gene family with any of eight currently available markers in the pRS vectors ( Table 5 ) . If a heavily marked strain such as BY418 is used as the recipient , up to eight di V erent genes can be knocked out before running out of selectable markers . In addition , the alleles that have no overlap ( or minimal overlap only at one end of the marker ) will be ideal for studies of DNA recombi - nation in which lack of homology between e . g . a plasmid and the chromosome is critical . It should be pointed out that an alternative and elegant strategy to solve the same problem was developed by Wach et al . ( 1994 ) , who constructed the kanMX4 marker , which has no homology with the yeast genome and confers dominant resistance to G418 , and hence can be used with strains of any background . Although kanMX4 does work as a selectable marker , G418 is an expensive reagent to use routinely , and expression of the drug resist - ance requires an outgrowth period prior to plating on G418 and so is somewhat less con - venient . Both strategies further enrich the already extensive molecular genetic toolkit available for S . cerevisiae . Table 5 . The pRS400 series of vectors .

For emphasis , sites in the polylinker that are no longer unique have been underlined . Maps of the pRS40X set may be converted to either the pRS41X set by the insertion of the CEN / ARS cassette or to the pRS42X set by insertion of the 2 (cid:236) cassette ( in either case , the Aat II site is destroyed ) . The numbering system is the same for all three sets . The direction of T3 or T7 polymerase transcription is as labeled . Numbers of parentheses refer to base pairs . Maps are drawn to scale . Figure 7 . Deﬁnition of the minimum complementing region of MET15 . A schematic diagram of the MET15 genomic region indicating relevant restriction sites . Lines below the restriction site diagram indicate the extent of the fragment tested for complementation of a met15 strain , and the column at the right indicates a qualitative analysis of the ability of each fragment to complement the met15 allele for growth . In all cases , the fragments were cloned into the polylinker of pRS413 and yeast ( strain 31 - 10C ; Cost and Boeke , 1996 ) transformants were selected on SD + Ura medium , and complementation analyses were performed by comparing colony sizes on selective medium between a wild - type MET15 + strain and the transformed strain . 130 c . b . brachmann et al . (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) Figure 8 . A universal primer set for producing PCR - mediated gene disruption cassettes . The double - stranded sequence shown represents about 50 bp surrounding a unique Nde I site in the parental plasmid backbone of all pRS400 series vectors [ the parental backbone is a pBLUESCRIPT / pBLUESCRIBE hybrid made by ligating a Pvu I fragment of pBLUESCRIPT II – SK ( containing the polylinker region ) to a Pvu I fragment of pBLUESCRIBE ( containing unique Nde I and Aat II sites ) ] . Minimal DNA segments that encode each of the selectable markers ( arrows indicate transcriptional orientation ) shown above were blunt - end ligated into the blunted Nde I site for each pRS400 series vector . A single pair of oligos can therefore be used to amplify by PCR each of the selectable marker genes . Sequences of oligos used for ampliﬁcation of the selectable marker genes are as indicated . Both oligos are drawn 5 (cid:42) to 3 (cid:42) . As indicated , 40 nts of sequence from either the upstream or downstream ﬂanking region of the gene to be deleted , in this case YFG , is added to the 5 (cid:42) end of each oligo . PCR - ampliﬁcation of the auxotrophic marker allele is performed using any pRS integrating vector as a template ( this is possible because the oligos are speciﬁc to the sequence just upstream and downstream of the Nde I vector site into which all markers were introduced ) . The resulting double - stranded PCR product is then transformed into yeast , replacing the genomic YFG allele by a double cross - over event . The resulting disruptions contain any of eight selectable markers transcribed in the orientations indicated . 131 designer deletion yeast strains and new yeast vectors (cid:63) 1998 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . yeast vol . 14 : 115 – 132 ( 1998 ) ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank our colleagues in the yeast community for providing information on alleles and for plas - mids .
