Huang . # ERS Journals Ltd 2004 . ABSTRACT : Lung overstretch involves mechanical factors , including large tidal volumes ( V T ) , which induce inﬂammatory responses . The current authors hypothesised that inspiratory ﬂow contributes to ventilator - induced inﬂammation . Buffer - perfused rabbit lungs were ventilated for 2 h with 21 % O 2 z 5 % CO 2 , positive end - expiratory pressure of 2 – 3 cmH 2 O and randomly assigned to either : 1 ) normal V T ( 6 mL ? kg - 1 ) at respiratory rate ( RR ) 30 , inspiration : expiration time ratio ( I : E ) 1 : 1 , low inspiratory ﬂow 6 mL ? kg - 1 ? s - 1 ; 2 ) large V T ( 12 mL ? kg - 1 ) at RR 30 , I : E 1 : 1 , high inspiratory ﬂow 12 mL ? kg - 1 ? s - 1 ( HRHF ) ; 3 ) large V T at RR 15 , I : E 1 : 1 , low inspiratory ﬂow 6 mL ? kg - 1 ? s - 1 ( LRLF ) ; or 4 ) large V T at RR 15 , I : E 1 : 2 . 3 , high inspiratory ﬂow 10 mL ? kg - 1 ? s - 1 ( LRHF ) . Physiological parameters , tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a , interleukin ( IL ) - 8 and activation of mitogen - activated protein kinases ( extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 / 2 , p38 and stress - activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) / c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) ) were measured . HRHF increased weight gain , perfusate IL - 8 and phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 , p38 and SAPK / JNK . These responses were absent during LRLF but present during LRHF . Changes in TNF - a were small . Tissue IL - 8 and phospho - ERK1 / 2 staining was localised primarily to smooth muscle , adventitia and bronchial epithelium within larger bronchioles and arterioles . These results indicate that mild overstretch of perfused lungs during high inspiratory ﬂow enhances inﬂammatory signalling by cells in lung regions most affected by strong turbulent airﬂow .

During mechanical ventilation , the lung is subjected to mechanical forces that produce overstretch , compression , and shear stress on bronchial and alveolar structures . Overstretch by high tidal volumes ( V T ) may produce overt lung oedema due to physical injury to alveolar - capillary membrane [ 1 , 2 ] while milder overstretch causes less direct injury . However , lung injury may still occur due to activation of intracellular signalling pathways and subsequent release of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 3 – 6 ] . In patients with acute lung injury , additional injury caused by such mechanical stress ( ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) ) contributes to mor - bidity and mortality [ 7 ] . The mechanisms of VILI have been attributed to stress and strain by lung overstretching at high V T / pressure ventilation . Ventilation of unperfused isolated rat lungs with 40 mL ? kg - 1 of V T increases chemokines ( macrophage inﬂammatory protein ( MIP ) - 2 ) and inﬂammatory cytokines ( tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) - a , interleukin ( IL ) - 1 b , IL - 6 ) in the airspaces [ 8 ] . Ventilation of rats at 20 mL ? kg - 1 for 2 h increases MIP - 2 in the bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) ﬂuid [ 9 ] . Ventilation of mice at 24 mL ? kg - 1 for 6 h increases MIP - 2 expression in lung homogenate , and in association with increased microvascular permeability and lung injury [ 3 ] . Ventilation of isolated mouse lungs with 15 mL ? kg - 1 increases MIP - 2 , TNF - a and IL - 6 release into the perfusate [ 10 – 13 ] . In vivo ventilation of rabbits with 12 – 15 mL ? kg - 1 for 4 h increases TNF - a concentration in BAL [ 14 ] . Ventilation of rats at high inspiratory pressure and positive end - expiratory pressure ( PEEP ; 45 / 10 cmH 2 O ) activates mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and nuclear factor - k B pathways [ 15 ] . These in vivo and ex vivo effects are supported by many in vitro studies , in which cultured lung epithelial cells [ 6 , 16 – 19 ] , endothelial cells [ 20 – 21 ] and macrophages [ 5 ] have been subjected to overstretch . Inspiratory ﬂow rate is also an important determinant of stress in the lung . High inspiratory ﬂow enhances tensile stress across alveolar surfaces resulting in greater transmission of kinetic energy to underlying structures despite the same volume change . High inspiratory ﬂow also increases shear stress parallel to the surface of the airways and alveolar walls , distorting lung parenchyma and deforming bronchial epithe - lial cells with little change in volume [ 22 ] . High inspiratory Eur Respir J 2004 ; 24 : 238 – 246 DOI : 10 . 1183 / 09031936 . 04 . 00128703 Printed in UK – all rights reserved Copyright # ERS Journals Ltd 2004 European Respiratory Journal ISSN 0903 - 1936 ﬂow is frequently needed to deliver adequate V T , but an independent contribution of inspiratory ﬂow to lung stretch - induced biochemical responses has not been determined . The purpose of this study was to determine whether high inspiratory ﬂow activates intracellular signalling pathways of inﬂammation . This hypothesis was tested in isolated buffered - perfused lung ventilated with a moderate V T ( 12 mL ? kg - 1 ) . Inspiratory ﬂows were varied by adjusting respiratory rate ( RR ) and inspiratory : expiratory time ratio ( I : E ) . The current authors then measured release of IL - 8 , TNF - a and activation of MAPK , all of which have been linked to the development of VILI [ 3 , 8 – 15 ] . The buffer - perfused lung system was used speciﬁcally to remove inﬂammatory effects produced by activated nonresident inﬂammatory cells migrating into the lung . This model has been shown to release chemokine / cytokine and protein kinase activation in response to various stimuli in the present authors 9 laboratory [ 23 – 26 ] . Material and methods Isolated perfused lung preparation The experimental protocol was approved by the Institu - tional Animal Care and Use Committee of Duke University . Isolation and perfusion of the lung was performed according to published techniques from this laboratory [ 24 – 26 ] . Brieﬂy , New Zealand White rabbits ( 3 . 0 – 3 . 6 kg ; Robinson 9 s Farm , Clemens , NC , USA ) were heparinised and anesthetised . The chest wall was opened , and the left atrium and the main pulmonary artery were cannulated . The aorta was also ligated to prevent loss of perfusate through the left ventricle . The circuit was washed free of blood with Krebs - Henseleit - 3 % albumin buffer . The perfusion circuit consisted of a reservoir , a roller pump ( Sarns , Inc . , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) a bubble trap and a heat exchanger , connected with Tygon tubing . The reservoir for collecting perfusate from the left atrium was suspended freely from a force transducer ( Model FT100 ; Grass Instrument Company , Quincy , MA , USA ) , and was levelled against the left atrium . Weight gain ( WG ) of the lung was measured by recording the loss of ﬂuid from the reservoir . The ﬂuid volume of the system was approximately 250 mL . The lungs were ventilated with 21 % O 2 z 5 % CO 2 and a PEEP of 2 – 3 cmH 2 O with an animal respirator ( Harvard Apparatus , Inc . , Holliston , MA , USA ) . The gas mixture contained 5 % CO 2 to maintain a perfusate partial pressure of CO 2 of 35 – 40 mmHg [ 27 ] to minimise the effects of hypocapnea on cytokine release [ 28 ] . The re - circulating ﬂow rate was 100 mL ? min - 1 . The air ﬂow was measured at the proximal end of the tracheostomy tube by a bidirectional Fleisch pneumotachometer ( No . 001206 ; Fleisch , Lausanne , Switzerland ) connected to a differential pressure transducer ( Statham , PM15 , Hato Rey , PR , USA ) to measure airﬂow rates up to 150 mL ? s - 1 . WG , pulmonary artery pressure ( P pa ) , airway pressure ( P aw ) and air ﬂow were recorded via a 4 - channel analog - to - digital converter connected to a PC computer equipped with a data acquisition software ( DATAQ Instruments , Inc . Akron , OH , USA ) . The initial V T was 6 mL ? kg - 1 , which produced peak P aw of 7 – 10 mmHg . Lungs were excluded if there were gross leaks or if the P pa was w 20 mmHg during the 10 - min stabilisation period . The perfusion buffer contains NaCl ( 82 . 8 mM ) , KCl ( 4 . 7 mM ) , KH 2 PO 4 ( 2 . 4 mM ) , NaHCO 3 ( 25 mM ) , MgSO 4 ( 1 . 2 mM ) , CaCl 2 ( 2 . 7 mM ) , dextrose ( 11 . 1 mM ) , and bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , fraction V ( 3 % , w / v ) . Ventilation protocols Lungs were randomly assigned to ventilation at either normal V T of 6 mL ? kg - 1 ( the control group ) or large V T of 12 mL ? kg - 1 ( table 1 ) . In the large V T group , three different protocols were used : 1 ) high RR with high inspiratory ﬂow ( HRHF ) ; 2 ) low RR with high inspiratory ﬂow ( LRHF ) and 3 ) low RR with low inspiratory ﬂow ( LRLF ) ( Table 1 ) . These three groups represented the same high volume stretch but different inspiratory ﬂow and respiratory rates . In HRHF , V T was increased , which also increased inspiratory ﬂow rate since RR and I : E were unchanged . In LRLF , RR was decreased by 50 % to create a lower inspiratory ﬂow rate matching that of the control group . In LRHF , I : E ratio was decreased to match the high inspiratory ﬂow of the HRHF group while RR remained low like LRLF . Typical tracings of air ﬂow and airway pressure for the four groups are shown in ﬁgure 1 . Air trapping was absent in all groups as indicated by zero ﬂow at end - expiration ( ﬁg . 1a – d ) . Lungs were ventilated and per - fused for 120 min . Serial 2 - mL perfusate samples were taken from the efﬂuent port and BAL was performed at the end of the experiment [ 29 ] . All ﬂuid samples were stored at - 80 u C until analysis . Measurement of epithelial permeability Epithelial permeability was estimated from BAL bovine albumin concentration measured using a bovine albumin ELISA quantitation kit ( Bethyl Laboratories , Inc . , Mont - gomery , TX , USA ) according to manufacturer 9 s recommenda - tions . The lower detection limit for the assay was 6 ng ? mL - 1 . Measurements of tumour necrosis factor - a and interleukin - 8 Concentrations of TNF - a and IL - 8 in perfusate and BAL ﬂuid were measured using ELISA kits according to manu - facturer 9 s recommendations ( R & D Systems , Inc . , Minneapo - lis , MN , USA ) . Immunohistochemistry Lungs were inﬂation ﬁxed using 4 % paraformaldehyde at 20 cmH 2 O pressure and embedded in parafﬁn .

KOTANI ET AL . sections were deparafﬁnised , rehydrated and stained for IL - 8 and phospho - extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1 / 2 . The primary antibodies were a goat - anti - human IL - 8 anti - body ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) and a monoclonal antibody against phospho - ERK1 / 2 respec - tively . The secondary antibodies were a biotin - conjugated donkey anti - goat immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G and goat anti - mouse IgG respectively ( Jackson ImmunoReseach Laboratories , Inc . , West Grove , PA , USA ) . Negative controls were done with irrelevant antibodies . The slides were examined with a Nikon microscope ( Eclipse E600 ; Nikon USA , Melville , NY , USA ) equipped with a digital camera and imaging software ( QCapture , version 2 . 56 ; Quantitative Imaging Corporation , Burnaby , BC , Canada ) . Western blot analysis After the experiments , lung tissues were homogenised on ice in RIPA lysis buffer ( 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 5 % deoxycholate , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 in PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) containing an antiprotease cocktail and 1 mM vanadyl sulphate . Lung homogenates were centrifuged at 10 , 000 6 g for 10 min , and the super - natants aliquoted . Samples were mixed with an equal volume of SDS - PAGE loading buffer ( 0 . 125 M Tris , pH 6 . 8 , 4 % SDS , 20 % glycerol , 10 % b - mercaptoethanol , and 0 . 05 % bromophenol blue ) , boiled and separated on 11 % SDS - PAGE gels in Tris - glycine - SDS buffer . Electrophoresed proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose , blocked with 3 % milk in 50 mM PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 h , washed with PBS - 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , and incubated overnight at 4 u C with primary antibodies in 5 % BSA in PBS - Tween . The primary antibodies were monoclonal antibodies against phospho - ERK1 / 2 , phos - pho - p38 , phospho - c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , ERK1 / 2 , p38 and JNK / stress - activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) ( all from Cell Signaling Technology , Inc . , Beverly , MA , USA ) . Blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) in 3 % milk in PBS - Tween for 1 h at room temperature . Protein bands were detected using chemiluminescence reagents and X - ray ﬁlm ( Amersham Life Science , Arlington Heights , IL , USA ) . Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean ¡ SE . Repeated measure analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was used to analyse physio - logical data . One way ANOVA followed by Sheffe 9 s test was used to analyse data . p - values were reported where statistics was performed . A p v 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . Results To ﬁnd an optimal V T to stretch the lung without overtly damaging the parenchyma , two other large tidal volumes ( 16 mL ? kg - 1 and 24 mL ? kg - 1 ) were tested in preliminary experiments using RR and I : E ratio similar to those in the 12 mL ? kg - 1 group . Both strategies produced severe alveolar oedema within 30 min . Thus 12 mL ? kg - 1 was chosen for large V T experiments . Physiological effects The control ventilation strategy ( 6 mL ? kg - 1 ) allowed stable P pa and P aw for 2 h with v 13 g WG ( table 2 ) . During 2 h of HRHF ventilation , P aw increased from 8 . 8 ¡ 0 . 2 mmHg to 24 . 3 ¡ 0 . 9 mmHg . WG averaged 33 g or 2 . 5 fold that of the control group ( p = 0 . 038 , interaction p v 0 . 0001 ) . P pa ranged from 12 – 16 mmHg during the 2 h and was similar to that of the control group . Microvascular pressure measured by the double occlusion technique was low ( data not shown ) . Bovine albumin concentration in the BAL ﬂuid was not elevated ( 0 . 55 ¡ 0 . 10 mg ? mL - 1 versus 0 . 33 ¡ 0 . 08 mg ? mL - 1 in the 6 mL ? kg - 1 group , p = 0 . 15 ) . Lungs ventilated with LRLF had lower WG ( p = 0 . 0045 , interaction p v 0 . 0001 ; table 2 ) , and slightly lower P aw compared to the HRHF group . P pa and BAL albumin ( 0 . 44 ¡ 0 . 13 mg ? mL - 1 ) were unchanged . The LRHF group had WG , P aw and P pa similar to those of HRHF ( table 2 ) . BAL albumin remained low ( 0 . 88 ¡ 0 . 32 mg ? mL - 1 , p = 0 . 15 versus HRHF ; p = 0 . 19 versus 6 mL ? kg - 1 ) . Compared to LRHF , LRLF lungs had lower P aw ( table 2 ) .

P pa and BAL albumin were also not different . Effects on tumour necrosis factor - a and interleukin - 8 After 2 h of HRHF ventilation , vascular release of IL - 8 increased by y 40 % compared to the control ( p = 0 . 035 ; ﬁg . 2 ) . BAL IL - 8 was not different . Compared to HRHF , lungs ventilated with LRLF had lower IL - 8 in the perfusate ( p = 0 . 044 ; ﬁg . 2 ) , similar to the control group . Lungs venti - lated with LRHF had higher perfusate IL - 8 similar to the HRHF group ( ﬁg . 2 ) . TNF - a concentration in the perfusate and BAL was low , and showed minimal variations among the four groups . The only statistically signiﬁcant change was that of BAL TNF - a between LRLF and LRHF ( ﬁg . 3 ) . HRHF resulted in strong IL - 8 staining primarily in the smooth muscle of bronchioles with an internal diameter w 1 mm and associated pulmonary arterioles ( ﬁg . 4 ) . Signiﬁ - cant IL - 8 staining was absent in lungs ventilated with LRLF . Effects on mitogen - activated protein kinase activation After 2 h of HRHF ventilation , MAPK activation was detected as shown by increased phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 ( ﬁg . 5 ) , p38 ( ﬁg . 6 ) and SAPK / JNK ( ﬁg . 7 ) . In lungs ventilated with LRHF , phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 , p38 and SAPK / JNK remained increased . In contrast , lungs ventilated with LRLF showed low MAPK activation similar to the control lungs . In HRHF lungs , phospho - ERK1 / 2 staining increased primarily in bronchial epithelial cells and pulmonary artery smooth muscles and adventitia ( ﬁg . 8 ) . Similar to IL - 8 , phospho - ERK1 / 2 staining increased primarily in bronchioles w 1 mm in internal diameter and associated pulmonary arterioles .

Discussion The major new ﬁndings of this study were that HRHF ventilation increased lung IL - 8 release and activated lung MAPK , both of which were absent during LRLF ventilation . Although changes in IL - 8 and MIP - 2 have been noted in other studies of isolated lungs [ 10 , 12 , 30 – 33 ] and of lungs ventilated with moderately large V T ( up to 20 mL ? kg - 1 ) in vivo [ 9 , 34 ] , inspiratory ﬂow rate was not controlled . IL - 8 is important because it is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant that is increased in patients with sepsis and persistent acute respiratory distress syndrome [ 35 – 37 ] . Furthermore , increased levels of anti - IL - 8 : IL - 8 complexes are associated with increased mortality [ 38 ] . IL - 8 is also angiogenic and induces proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells [ 39 ] . Several resident cells in the lung can produce IL - 8 with mechanical stress , including epithelial cells [ 5 , 6 , 18 ] and alveolar macrophages [ 5 ] . The immunochemical staining in the current study indicates that smooth muscle cells of larger pulmonary arterioles and bronchioles were also sources of IL - 8 release . A growing body of evidence indicates that MAPK activation is an early event in signalling from mechanosensors to nucleus to stimulate gene transcription [ 40 ] . Rapid phos - phorylation of ERK , p38 and SAPK / JNK has been observed in cultured lung cells submitted to cyclic stretch [ 16 , 18 , 41 ] . Phosphorylation of ERK1 / 2 and SAPK / JNK was found in adult rats ventilated with an injurious high pressure ( peak inspiratory pressure / PEEP = 45 / 10 cmH 2 O ) [ 15 ] and activation of ERK1 / 2 and SAPK / JNK was found in alveolar epithelial cells . In the current study , lungs ventilated with lower peak inspiratory pressure / PEEP ( 35 / 3 cmH 2 O ) also activated ERK1 / 2 , (cid:5) (cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:8)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5)(cid:5) (cid:22)(cid:10) * (cid:24)(cid:20) (cid:19) & (cid:13) (cid:18) (cid:24) & " + (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:7)(cid:15)(cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:17) , (cid:26) (cid:1)(cid:2) (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:15)(cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:17) , (cid:26) (cid:1)(cid:2) - (cid:15)(cid:25) .

Activation of ERK1 / 2 was most promi - nent in larger pulmonary arterioles and bronchioles . The differences in cellular distribution may be related to the degree of lung stretch injury relative to the magnitude of ﬂow shear stress ( see below ) . Perhaps the most important ﬁnding of the present study was that IL - 8 release and MAPK activation during HRHF could be prevented by reducing inspiratory ﬂow ( LRLF ) . During inﬂation , lung parenchyma and airways are subject to both tensile stress and shear stress [ 42 ] . Tensile stress acts perpendicularly to the surface and its magnitude is deter - mined by transpulmonary pressure . Shear stress acts in a primarily parallel direction to the surface and , the magnitude of shear stress with laminar ﬂow is determined by the viscosity , average ﬂow velocity and the diameter of the airway : Laminar shear stress ( t w ) ~ 8 | m | ( V = D ) ð 1 Þ Where m is the viscosity of air ; V is average ﬂow velocity ( volumetric ﬂow rate divided by tube area , p D 2 / 4 ) ; and D is the tube diameter . The HRHF protocol of the current study used a V T of 12 mL ? kg - 1 to ventilate the lung at 30 breaths per min and an I : E ratio of 1 : 1 resulting in an average inspiratory ﬂow of 12 mL ? kg ? s - 1 . Assuming the viscosity of air is 1 . 73 6 10 - 5 N - s ? m - 2 , the laminar shear stress at the rabbit trachea ( internal diameter = 6 mm ) during HRHF ventilation would be y 0 . 03 N ? m - 2 . At large airways where the ﬂow is primarily turbulent , Reynold 9 s stress dominates and can be several hundredfold higher than the laminar shear stress ( 3 – 10 N ? m - 2 ) . Even in lower airways with an internal diameter of 0 . 6 mm ( 8 – 10th generation ) where the volumetric ﬂow rate has fallen signiﬁcantly , wall shear stress may still be signiﬁ - cant , especially at airway bifurcations and curvature [ 43 ] . This concept is supported by the increased IL - 8 and ERK1 / 2 immunostaining in bronchioles w 1 mm in internal diameter . The current ﬁndings did not exclude the contribution of lung oedema or the higher velocity of perpendicular stress applied to alveolar surface in the HRHF group to IL - 8 release and the degree of MAPK activation . However , this effect would be much less than in previous studies where very large tidal volumes were used and tissue destruction was pronounced [ 10 , 12 , 30 – 33 ] . Fluid - induced shear stress in the range of 0 . 5 – 5 N ? m - 2 activates MAPK , enhances inﬂammatory cytokine release , induces gene expression , and regulates cytoskeletal alignment and cell proliferation in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells [ 20 , 44 – 51 ] . Little is known , however , about the biochemical effects of shear stress produced by high airﬂow on pulmonary cells or in the lung . High inspiratory ﬂow should produce the greatest impact on the epithelium of larger airways and surrounding structures as high tangential forces on the epithelium create horizontal deﬂection of plasma membranes relative to internal structures , e . g . cytoskeleton elements [ 52 ] . Such distortion may activate deformation - sensitive membrane - and cytoskeleton - mediated mechanotransduction [ 53 ] . Using ﬁnite element analysis , L AI - F OOK and K ALLOK [ 54 ] studied interactions between the artery and bronchus , and found that distorting forces applied to bronchus or artery produce non - uniform stress around both structures . The stress concentra - tion is several times the mean periarterial and peribronchial radial stress at the interstitial space adjoining the artery and bronchus . These analyses suggest that stress on the bronchial wall may be transmitted to adjacent artery via the interstitium and that the interstitum within the bronchoarterial sheath may be the focal point of tears during lung hyperinﬂation . The profuse IL - 8 and MAPK staining in and around the pulmonary artery ( smooth muscle and adventitia ) at high ﬂow in the current study provides evidence for this hypoth - esis . The mechanosensors responsible are not known ; such structures on bronchial epithelial cells are not well deﬁned , but candidates include integrin receptors [ 55 ] , amiloride - sensitive sodium channels [ 56 – 58 ] , and perhaps cilia [ 52 ] . The prominent effects of HRHF on IL - 8 and MAPK were in contrast to the relatively minor effects on TNF - a . It is possible that the mechanical stress during HRHF ventilation might not have been sufﬁcient to trigger TNF - a release . Several studies using larger V T have demonstrated increased TNF - a in BAL [ 8 , 31 , 33 ] while others did not [ 30 , 59 , 60 ] . It is possible that TNF - a release is accentuated by simultaneous insults , e . g . , endotoxin [ 17 , 30 ] or ischaemia [ 8 ] . The lack of an intact bronchial circulation in isolated lungs may also inﬂuence the cellular responses . In conclusion , the current authors report that inspiratory ﬂow is an important mechanical determinant of vascular interleukin - 8 release and mitogen - activated protein kinase activation during mild lung stretch , and the main effects occur on cells within larger bronchopulmonary structures .

Application of positive end - expiratory pressure alleviates some of these stresses by preventing derecruitment of unstable alveoli [ 34 ] . The study suggests that high inspira - tory ﬂow rates may also stimulate larger airways and pulmonary arterioles to release inﬂammatory mediators , and that reducing inspiratory ﬂow might provide additional lung protection .
