Kahlert 12 * † and on behalf of the Corona Immunitas Research Group Abstract Background : We aimed to determine whether living in a household with children is associated with SARS‑CoV‑2 seropositivity in adults and investigated interacting factors that may influence this association . Methods : SARS‑CoV‑2 serology testing was performed in randomly selected individuals from the general popula‑ tion between end of October 2020 and February 2021 in 11 cantons in Switzerland . Data on sociodemographic and household characteristics , employment status , and health‑related history was collected using questionnaires . Mul‑ tivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association of living with children < 18 years of age ( number , age group ) and SARS‑CoV‑2 seropositivity . Further , we assessed the influence of reported non‑household contacts , employment status , and gender . Results : Of 2393 working age participants ( 18 – 64 years ) , 413 ( 17 . 2 % ) were seropositive . Our results suggest that living with children and SARS‑CoV‑2 seropositivity are likely to be associated ( unadjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 1 . 22 , 95 % confidence interval [ 0 . 98 – 1 . 52 ] , adjusted OR 1 . 25 [ 0 . 99 – 1 . 58 ] ) . A pattern of a positive association was also found for subgroups of children aged 0 – 11 years ( OR 1 . 21 [ 0 . 90 – 1 . 60 ] ) and 12 – 17 years ( OR 1 . 14 [ 0 . 78 – 1 . 64 ] ) . Odds of seroposi‑ tivity were higher with more children ( OR 1 . 14 per additional child [ 1 . 02 – 1 . 27 ] ) . Men had higher risk of SARS‑CoV‑2 infection when living with children than women ( interaction : OR 1 . 74 [ 1 . 10 – 2 . 76 ] ) . Conclusions : In adults from the general population living with children seems associated with SARS‑CoV‑2 seroposi‑ tivity . However , child‑related infection risk is not the same for every subgroup and depends on factors like gender . Further factors determining child‑related infection risk need to be identified and causal links investigated .

BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 233 Background The role of children and adolescents in the transmis - sion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is still not fully understood [ 1 , 2 ] . Children mostly have mild or no symptoms of corona - virus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) if infected by SARS - CoV - 2 [ 3 ] and long COVID does occur but is much less frequent than in adults [ 4 – 6 ] . While children are rarely seriously affected themselves , the extent to which they can spread the virus and put more vulnerable groups at risk remains debatable . Household transmission accounts for a substantial number of SARS - CoV - 2 infections [ 7 – 9 ] . However , robust data on transmission patterns in household is scarce [ 10 ] and evidence on the association between living in a household with children and SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity is inconsistent . Large population - based studies in the UK , Denmark , and France suggest a higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections for people living in a household with children [ 11 – 14 ] . In contrast , studies among healthcare workers showed an opposite effect [ 15 , 16 ] . This indicates that there may also be protective effects related to living in a household with children . Whether protective - or risk - increasing effects prevail might depend on the presence of other factors ( e . g . , time spent at home due to employment status / role as caregiver , behavioral factors such as non - household contacts , adherence to social distancing and hygiene measures ) . These factors are known to affect both intra - and extra household SARS - CoV - 2 transmission risk , but their role is still unknown and thus needs further exploration . Most studies that have assessed the association of living with children and SARS - CoV - 2 infections so far stand out for their large sample sizes . However , many of them are retrospective and based on data from reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reac - tion ( RT - PCR ) confirmed infections . As a result , they could overrepresent symptomatic infections , while asymptomatic infections are misclassified , as individu - als with subclinical infections are less likely to undergo PCR testing . Furthermore , testing policies have varied throughout the pandemic phases due to reagents avail - ability and testing capacities . Serological studies have been pointed out as reliable tool to understand the full spectrum of symptoms of COVID - 19 , and the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 infections [ 17 , 18 ] . In combination with a random selection of participants , and pre - defined ques - tionnaires , serological studies allow a more targeted assessment of variables and are less prone to recall - and other information biases . This study used SARS - CoV - 2 serology results and questionnaire data from working age participants ( 18 – 64 years ) of the Corona Immunitas research program in Switzerland [ 19 ] . The main objective of this study was to investigate whether living in a household with children is associated with SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity in adults . More specifically we investigated first if SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity in adults is associated with the number of children in the household , and with specific age groups of children and secondly , if this association varies by fre - quency of contacts outside the household , employment status , and gender . Methods The manuscript has been written following the Con - sortium for the Standardization of Influenza Seroepi - demiology ( CONSISE ) statement on the Reporting of Seroepidemiologic Studies for Influenza ( ROSES - I ) [ 20 ] . Context Corona Immunitas is a nationally coordinated research program of seroprevalence studies in Switzerland and is characterized by uniform SARS - CoV - 2 antibody tests , standardized questionnaires , and protocols [ 19 ] . For this set of analyses , we focused on data collected between the end of October 2020 and February 2021 in the following sites across Switzerland : Basle - City ( BS ) , Basle - Country ( BL ) , Berne ( BE ) , Fribourg ( FR ) , Grisons ( GR ) , Lucerne ( LU ) , Neuchatel ( NE ) , St . Gallen ( SG ) , Ticino ( TI ) , Vaud ( VD ) , and Zurich ( ZH ) . The geographic location of the can - tons is displayed in Fig . 1 . These cantons comprise a total population of around 5 . 9 million ( roughly 69 % of the Swiss population ) , living in both urban and rural areas , and rep - resent all language regions ( German , French , Italian , and Romansh ) . A timeline of SARS - CoV - 2 incidence in Switzerland is given in Fig . 2A . Switzerland had one of the highest sec - ond waves in Europe in autumn 2020 . The SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination campaign in Switzerland started in most cantons in January 2021 , prioritizing the immunization of people at high risk of severe disease and healthcare workers . The serostatus of the study population remained barely affected by SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination , as the vacci - nation campaign initially progressed at low speed , mainly due to limited vaccine supply .

The following cantons are displayed : Basle‑City ( BS ) , Basle‑Country ( BL ) , Berne ( BE ) , Fribourg ( FR ) , Grisons ( GR ) , Lucerne ( LU ) , Neuchatel ( NE ) , St .

A Total number of daily RT‑PCR confirmed SARS‑CoV‑2 cases in Switzerland for the period of March 2020 – April 2020 obtained from official statistics [ 21 ] . B Total number of positive and negative daily blood samples across all study sites ( SenASTrIS antibody test result ) Page 4 of 13 Blankenberger et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 233 Study design and participants Participants were randomly selected from the residen - tial registries of participating cantons provided by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and invited to participate by postal mail or email . Excluded from this registry are diplomats , persons with a foreign address in the regis - try , persons in asylum procedure , persons with a short - term residence permit , and elderly people in nursing homes . Invited individuals were asked to schedule an appointment for peripheral venous blood sampling for antibody analysis at one of the study sites . Vulnerable persons ( see West et al . [ 19 ] for definition ) could sched - ule a home - visit for blood sampling . Study participants did not receive any financial compensation for their par - ticipation in the study , except for the travel expenses to the study centre . For this analysis , only working - age par - ticipants aged 18 – 64 years were included . These partici - pants are more likely to be parents or primary caregivers of minors in the same household . Inclusion of older par - ticipants might have introduced bias , as this age group is at increased risk for severe COVID - 19 and thereby more likely to implement recommended protective measures in their daily lives . Serology analysis The primary outcome variable was the binary SARS - CoV - 2 antibody test result . SARS - CoV - 2 immunoglobu - lin A ( IgA ) and immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibodies become detectable in most cases around 6 – 15 days after symptom onset ( 6 – 10 days for IgA , 11 – 15 days for IgG ) [ 22 ] . We analyzed sera extracted from the venous blood using SenASTrIS ( Sensitive Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Spike Trimer Immunoglobulin Serological ) , a Luminex binding assay purposely developed by the Vaud University Hos - pital ( CHUV ) , the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne ( EPFL ) , and the Swiss Vaccine Center . The assay measures binding of IgG and IgA antibodies to the trimeric SARS - CoV - 2 S - protein . The overall test result was counted as positive when either SARS - CoV - 2 - IgG and / or - IgA signal was above cutoff . Indeterminate test results , meaning a signal just below the predefined cut - off , were retested , but all confirmed “indeterminate” and thus counted as negative . The test has a high specificity ( 99 . 7 % ) and sensitivity ( 96 . 6 % ) and has been validated in samples of the general population as well as specific sub - groups of people : individuals with RT - PCR confirmed asymptomatic / paucisymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion , individuals with contact to a RT - PCR confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 case , and pre - pandemic blood samples of people infected with other viruses ( including the human endemic coronaviruses E229 , OC43 , HKU1 , or NL63 ) . A more detailed description of the test and its validation regarding antibody kinetics is available elsewhere [ 22 ] . Questionnaires Information on the main exposure of interest ( living in a household with children ) , potential confounders , and effect modifying variables was retrieved from the Corona Immunitas baseline questionnaires . Participants com - pleted the questionnaires online either at home shortly before the blood sampling appointment or at the testing sites . Information was collected on sociodemographic ( age , gender , monthly household income in Swiss francs ( CHF ) , nationality , education ) and household character - istics ( household size , age , and gender of each household members ) , employment status ( employed / unemployed , working part - time / full - time from home due to SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic ) , health - related behavior , and comor - bidities ( smoking , diagnosed with cancer , diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , chronic respiratory disease , or immunocompromised ) , SARS - CoV - 2 com - patible symptoms , and tests ( previous SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR or serology tests ) , as well as information on contacts ( number of non - household contacts during the last 7 days for longer than 15 min and less than 1 . 5 m distance ) . Household members were considered children if they were younger than 18 years . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using R statistical soft - ware ( version 4 . 0 . 3 , R Foundation for Statistical Com - puting , Vienna , Austria ) . The following packages were used : MASS [ 23 ] , tidyverse [ 24 ] , knitr [ 25 ] , tableone [ 26 ] . Sociodemographic - and household characteristics , employment status , and underlying health conditions were described stratified by seropositivity . Variables were reported as median and interquartile range ( IQR ) , mean and standard deviation ( SD ) , and frequency and percent - age , as appropriate . We used logistic regressions to assess the odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity when living in a a house - hold with children in a complete - case analysis . We ran unadjusted and subsequently adjusted regression mod - els to account for the potential confounding effect of age , gender , income , education , and smoking . Based on what has been described by Forbes et al . [ 11 ] , confound - ers were identified using the directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) approach ( see Fig . 3 ) . With DAG , hypothetical relations of variables of interest can be visually summa - rized . Arrows are used to indicate the direction of the assumed causal effects . Through the application of a standardized set of criteria confounders can be deduced that need to be controlled for to identify the causal effect of interest [ 27 – 29 ] . We then performed the same analysis entering the number of children per household as the main explana - tory variable . To determine if the odds of SARS - CoV - 2 Page 5 of 13 Blankenberger et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 233 seropositivity is different when living only with younger children compared to living only with older children , we stratified the analysis by age group ( 0 – 11 and 12 – 17 years , and separately for age 0 – 5 and 6 – 11 years ) . These age groups were formed to reflect school stages and protective measures implemented at schools ( age 0 – 5 : pre - school , 6 – 11 : primary school without obligation to wear a mask , 12 – 17 : primary , secondary school , or tertiary education with obligation to wear a mask ) and correspond with age groups used in other studies [ 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 ] . Participants with children in more than one of the respective age groups were excluded from the analysis on age groups . We assessed several factors , that potentially modify the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity related to liv - ing with children , as they affect both intra - and extra - household SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . We chose employment status ( being unemployed or telework ver - sus working outside of home ) , presence of non - house - hold contacts ( approximated by number of reported non - household contacts within the previous seven Fig . 3 Directed acyclic graph illustrating implicitly assumed causal structure between exposure to children and SARS‑CoV‑2 seropositivity . Each arrow implies an assumed causal effect from the variable the arrow originates to the variable the arrow is directed at . Variables lying on a directed path between exposure and the outcome of interest ( e . g . , other adult household members size ) do not have to be controlled for . However , variables preceding both exposure and outcome may introduce biases and need to be controlled for . In this case the minimal sufficient adjustment sets for estimating the direct effect of household child exposure on SARS‑CoV‑2 seropositivity are as follows : • Age , education , income , gender , and smoking . • Age , income , nationality , gender , and smoking . HH household Page 6 of 13 Blankenberger et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 233 days ) , and gender as variables to be assessed for their interacting effects . Both , people not working at home and people with frequent contacts outside of the house - hold contact might have relatively higher risk of becom - ing infected outside the household [ 30 , 31 ] , while their risk for intra household transmission is lower due to a shorter exposure time . Male gender has been shown to be associated with both a higher intra - and extra house - hold transmission risk [ 32 ] . At the same time women , in general and throughout the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic in particular , often spent more time at home in direct contact with children [ 33 ] . Each potential effect modi - fying variable was assessed in a separate multivariable logistic regression model ( the same model as used for previously described analysis adjusting for confound - ers ) , assessing both the main and interaction effect of the individual variable as well as the interaction term ( effect modifying variable × ≥ 1 child in household ) . Sensitivity analysis Several sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the consistency of our results . For the main analysis , all participants , irrespective whether they live alone or in a multi - person household were included . The majority of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission occurs within households [ 7 – 9 ] . For people living alone , this risk is absent . Thus , including individuals living in single - person households might skew the results of people living in a household without children . We therefore reran our logistic regres - sion models including only individuals with at least one other household member . Although vaccination campaigns in Switzerland started at the end of December 2020 , having received at least one dose of a SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine was no exclusion criteria for the main analysis . As some of the participants might already have been vaccinated by the time the blood sam - ple was taken , we reran our analysis excluding people that have reported to have received at least on vaccine dose as part of our sensitivity analysis . When using the DAG - approach to identify confound - ers , the direction of the relationship of having children and smoking was not distinct . Our initial DAG assumed that there is a self - selection of healthier people becom - ing parents [ 34 ] , turning smoking into a confounder that requires adjustment . However , having children also leads to parents living healthier lives [ 35 , 36 ] . In this case , the relationship between smoking and living with children is inverse , and smoking , acting as a mediator in this case , would not need to be controlled for . Thus , as part of our sensitivity analysis , we also assessed the association of living with children and SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity in a multivariable logistic regression model without smoking as a confounder . Results Overall participation rate across all study sites was 18 . 8 % ( range 11 . 7 to 25 . 5 % ) . Antibody test results were avail - able for 4273 participants , of which 2393 were 18 – 64 years old . We excluded 1838 participant aged 65 years and older , of which only 15 reported to live in a house - hold with children , and 42 participants younger than 18 years . Of 2393 , 413 participants ( 17 . 3 % ) were seroposi - tive according to the Luminex test ( 68 only IgA - positive , 83 only IgG - positive , 262 both IgA and IgG - positive ) . Fif - teen participants ( 0 . 8 % ) were seronegative but reported a positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR - test in the questionnaire . Ten participants ( 0 . 4 % ) reported a SARS - CoV - 2 - related hospital stay . Of those with known vaccination status , 13 ( 0 . 5 % ) participants reported to have received at least one dose of SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination , of which 5 were sero - positive . The progress of SARS - CoV - 2 serology testing and number of daily positive and negative blood samples is displayed in Fig . 2B . Characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . In total , 827 participants ( 34 . 8 % ) reported to live in a household with at least one child ( range : 1 – 7 chil - dren per household , mean 1 · 74 ( standard deviation : 0 · 74 ) per participant’s household ) . The median age of children was 9 years ( interquartile range ( IQR ) = 4 – 13 years ) . Of all participants living with children , 459 ( 55 . 5 % ) lived only with children aged 0 – 11 years , 244 ( 29 . 5 % ) lived only with children aged 12 – 17 years and 124 ( 15 . 0 % ) lived with children of both age groups . Association of living with children and SARS‑CoV‑2 seropositivity Results of the logistic regression analysis are reported in Table 2 . In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses ( see unadjusted analysis and Model 1 , Table 2 ) , a trend of higher odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity was observed in adults when living in a household with children with similar odds ratios in both models . Odds ratios for SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity when liv - ing with children were similar for the subgroup of chil - dren aged 0 – 11 and 12 – 17 years . However , associations were not as clear and confidence intervals were wider ( see Model 2 , Table 2 ) . This was also observed after sub - dividing participants living with 0 – 11 - year - old children into those living with 0 – 5 - or 6 – 11 - year - old children ( for children 0 – 5 years : odds ratio ( OR ) 1 . 24 and 95 % confi - dence interval [ 0 . 84 – 1 . 80 ] , for children 6 – 11 years : OR 1 . 39 [ 0 . 88 – 2 . 14 ] ) . We observed a positive association between SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity and number of children in the household ( see Model 3 , Table 2 ) .

Effect modification by employment status , number of non‑household contacts , and gender Odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity were not higher for individuals with non - household contacts within the pre - vious seven days ( see Model 4 , Table 2 ) . Being unem - ployed or working full - time from home was associated with lower odds of seropositivity ( see Model 5 , Table 2 ) . Although some interacting effect of work situation might be possible , interaction terms in both models showed no clear picture that either variable altered odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity in people living with children ( see interaction terms Models 4 and 5 , Table 2 ) . This was different for gender , with male participants who live in a household with children having substantially higher odds of seropositivity compared to women ( see interac - tion term Model 6 , Table 2 ) .

BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 233 Also , no substantial alteration of results was observed after removing smoking as a confounder in the multivari - able analysis ( OR 1 . 25 [ 0 . 99 – 1 . 58 ] ) . Discussion In this cross - sectional study , we analyzed the associa - tion between SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity and living in a household with children , based on questionnaire and serology data from population - based SARS - CoV - 2 sero - prevalence studies in 11 cantons in Switzerland . Our results suggest that for the general population overall odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity may be higher when a household is shared with at least one child of any age . However , despite this association in the general popula - tion , risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection related to living in a household with children might vary between subgroups . Indeed , interaction analyses indicated higher odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity when living in a household with children for men than for women . Although the precision ( described by the confidence interval ) of the overall analysis limits our ability to make definite general statements , the finding of a posi - tive association of living with children and SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity in our sample of general adult population in Switzerland is consistent with other population - based SARS - CoV - 2 studies [ 11 – 14 ] . Results of the multivari - able analysis in our study were very similar to what has been observed by Carrat et al . based on seroprevalence data in France , where a comparable population - based SARS - CoV - 2 antibody testing approach has been fol - lowed [ 13 ] . A positive association of living with children and SARS - CoV - 2 infection was also reported in popula - tion - based studies in Denmark [ 12 ] and during the sec - ond wave in the UK [ 11 ] , which have calculated hazard ratios based on data from PCR - confirmed infections . While taken these results together , all studies agree that for the general population an association is very likely , our study in line with the other studies indicates that the strength of this association is only weak to moderate . Neither adjusted odd ratios in our study ( OR 1 . 25 [ 0 . 99 – 1 . 59 ] ) and reported by Carrat et al . from France ( OR 1 . 3 [ 1 . 11 – 1 . 53 ] ) nor hazard ratios reported by Husby et al . from Denmark ( hazard ratio 1 . 05 [ 1 . 02 – 1 . 09 ] and by Forbes et al . from the second wave in the UK ( hazard ratio 1 . 06 [ 1 . 05 – 1 . 08 ] and 1 . 22 [ 1 . 20 – 1 . 24 ] for living with children aged 0 – 11 and 12 – 17 , respectively ) indicates a strong increase in risk of SARS - CoV - 2 when a household is shared with children [ 11 – 13 ] . Next to our observations on the association of living with children and SARS - CoV - 2 infection in general , we observed that the odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity increases with every additional child in the household . A similar finding has been made by Husby et al . based on PCR - data in Denmark , which has shown a positive trend of higher hazard ratios for SARS - CoV - 2 infection when living in a household with one , two , and three or more children , respectively [ 12 ] . Odds ratios were similar for all children’s age groups . Results were comparable to the observations made in the overall analysis , although confi - dence intervals were wider ( likely due to the lower num - ber of cases in this subanalysis ) . Therefore , our results do not indicate that living with children of a particular age group has a stronger association with seropositivity than living with children of other age groups . Differences in number of non - household contacts have been proposed as a potential behavioral reason for an altered SARS - CoV - 2 infection risk , when living with children . For example , Husby et al . suggested that living with children might lead to more non - household contacts as caregivers accompany their children on playdates [ 12 ] while another study suggests people living with children have less non - household contacts , because they are more likely to stay at home and spend time as a family [ 15 ] . In our study , the odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity were not higher for people with at least one non - household contact reported within the previous seven days . Thus , differences in contact patterns likely do not explain an altered SARS - CoV - 2 infection risk related to living in a household with children . In line with other studies [ 14 , 31 ] , being unemployed or working from home was inversely associ - ated with seropositivity , which is likely explained by the substantially lower work and commute - related risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Interaction analyses for both non - household contacts and employment status showed no clear picture of an effect modification . Consistent with findings from other studies , SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity related to living with children was dependent on gender [ 11 , 12 ] . While in our analysis SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity was not associated with gender itself , male participants had substantially higher rates of SARS - CoV - 2 seroposi - tivity if they lived in a household with children . As antibody tests cannot identify the exact time - point of infection and participants’ household members were not tested , we were unable to define transmission routes or determine the extent to which living with chil - dren and SARS - CoV - 2 infections in adults are causally related . Children being able to get infected and trans - mit the virus to others could impose a direct risk to adults living in the same household . At the same time , there are other individual characteristics and behavio - ral factors that are associated with sharing a household with children , which could be of importance regarding SARS - CoV - 2 infection risk . There is some evidence indicating that children could increase the risk of a SARS - CoV - 2 infection in house - hold members by being a direct source of infection . Page 10 of 13 Blankenberger et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 233 PCR - based studies have shown a higher secondary attack rate of paediatric compared to adult index cases in households [ 37 , 38 ] . With milder clinical manifesta - tions [ 39 – 41 ] , SARS - CoV - 2 infections in children tend to remain undiagnosed [ 42 ] and unnoticed SARS - CoV - 2 infections in children could keep households from implementing necessary isolation measures to interrupt transmission chains . Further , young children cannot be isolated from their caregivers when being sick [ 43 ] , and social distancing and hygiene measures are more diffi - cult to implement . Also , restrictions in extra - curricular activities in early 2021 in Switzerland were limited only for children older than 12 years [ 2 ] and apart from a relatively short period during the first wave in March – April 2020 , schools in Switzerland have remained open . School - aged children and adolescents have shown to be more mobile and tend to have more close contacts with individuals outside the household [ 44 ] . As such , the rela - tive risk of children to acquire a SARS - CoV - 2 infection outside the household might have been substantially higher in comparison to adults . On the contrary , several studies have shown that chil - dren only account for a very small proportion of index cases within household clusters [ 45 – 47 ] and infectivity is lower when index cases are asymptomatic [ 9 , 37 , 48 ] , as it is frequently the case in children . Our results pro - vide no evidence that the odds of SARS - CoV - 2 seroposi - tivity are substantially increased in individuals spending more time at home with contact to children ( e . g . , people being unemployed or performing work from home , peo - ple having no non - household contacts ) . Furthermore , our results and other studies [ 15 , 16 ] show that although there is an association in the general population not eve - rybody living with children is at increased risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and for certain groups even the opposite is the case ( i . e . , odds of SARS - CoV - 2 infections are lower when living with children ) . In our study , SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity for men living with children was substan - tially increased . A negative association between living with children and SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity was also observed among healthcare workers in Scotland [ 15 ] and Switzerland [ 16 ] . This suggests that risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection related to living with children is not only determined by the child’s infectivity , but other characteristics and behav - ioural factors do play a role , of which some can also be protective . One of those protective effects might be related to seasonally spreading human endemic corona - viruses , due to which children might possess some cross - immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 [ 49 , 50 ] , and more frequent co - infections with other viruses could interfere with the replication of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 49 ] . Individuals spending a lot of time at home taking care of children could profit of such cross - immunity and other competing infections , due to increased exposure . This effect could be particu - larly prominent in women who , already before the pan - demic , more often spent time at home taking care of children [ 33 ] . Living with children further leads to more part - time work , as more time is allocated to childcare . People working in professions with high risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission such as healthcare [ 51 , 52 ] could thereby profit from living with children , as they spend less time at work being exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 . At the same time , in healthcare workers , social distancing and hygiene measures might have been better implemented , that have shown to significantly reduce transmission risk from a child , if infected [ 53 ] . Although we were unable to assess these factors related to working in healthcare jobs in our study , this could to some extent explain the discrepancies of our findings in comparison with studies conducted among healthcare workers [ 15 , 16 ] . With our study design using retrospectively reported symptoms , we were unable to define if severity of COVID - 19 is different for people living with children versus people living without . Number of SARS - CoV - 2 - related hospital admissions was low in our popula - tion - based cohort ( total number : 10 , of which 3 living with children ) . Thus , in contrast to previous studies [ 11 , 12 , 15 ] , we were unable to use this variable as a proxy to assess severity of COVID - 19 . An additional analysis on self - reported symptoms in participants revealed that most symptoms occur with similar frequencies in sero - positive individuals with children compared to seroposi - tive individuals without children ( see additional file 1 : Table S1 ) . For seronegative individuals , symptoms were generally more frequent in people living with children compared to people living without , indicating that people living in a household with children might get more often sick , but this is likely not related to SARS - CoV - 2 . Despite its strength of being a large nation - wide pop - ulation - based study using a highly sensitive and spe - cific SARS - CoV - 2 antibody test , this study has some limitations . Overall participation rate was moderate and non - random willingness to participate in the survey is possible ( e . g . , higher participation of more highly edu - cated individuals , individuals who experienced symptoms suggestive of COVID - 19 , individuals with a confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection , or individuals who were exposed or believed themselves to be exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 ) . However , we have no reason to believe that non - random willingness to participate in the study has been substan - tially different among people living with compared to people living without children . Although some selection bias cannot be ruled out , we expect the effect , if any , to be of very small influence on the overall results . Due to the limited number of participants , some associations could Page 11 of 13 Blankenberger et al . BMC Medicine ( 2022 ) 20 : 233 not be estimated precisely . Especially results of the anal - ysis of subgroups as well as interaction analysis should thus be interpreted with caution . Participants’ character - istics were furthermore self - reported , and some variables could be only assessed as approximations ( see number of non - household contacts ) . Accuracy on some variables might be limited and , in some cases , recall bias could have occurred . Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test used , some misclassification is possible and effect sizes may be biased towards the null and thus some associations could have been missed . Especially in case of SARS - CoV - 2 infections that date back longer , SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies might have waned . However , as we expect this to have happened irrespec - tive of living with children , overall results are likely not substantially affected . In general , with serology results , we were unable to determine the timepoint when infec - tion occurred . Infection risk related to living with chil - dren could have been different with different transmission dynamics at different stages of the SARS - CoV - 2 pan - demic in Switzerland . Our study most accurately depicts the pandemic situation during a time of high commu - nity transmission during the second wave in Switzerland . Given that SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies take around 6 – 15 days to become detectable [ 22 ] , very few samples taken as part of our study ( those that were collected in October 2020 , when community transmission was just starting to rise in Switzerland ) , would not represent second - wave transmis - sion dynamics . Transmissions within households with the delta and omicron variant of SARS - CoV - 2 appears to be further increased [ 54 , 55 ] . However , these strains did not become prevalent in Switzerland until May 2021 ( delta variant ) and November 2021 ( omicron variant ) , respec - tively [ 21 ] , later than our data collection . Next to variation in containment measures , intra household transmission could have been lower at later stages of the pandemic , because with increasing number of immune household members ( due to previous infection or vaccination ) also non - immune household members are protected [ 56 ] . Conclusions SARS - CoV - 2 seropositivity in the general population may be higher when living in a household with children , but increased SARS - CoV - 2 infection risk , if any , was not found to be particularly strong . Moreover , the risk is not the same for every subgroup and might be higher for men compared to women . Although it is impossible to establish direct causal links with our study design , it is likely that several risk increasing and protective effects related to living with children play a role . Fur - ther research is needed to understand the mechanisms for these effects . This could eventually allow for more targeted statements about risks to specific subgroups .
