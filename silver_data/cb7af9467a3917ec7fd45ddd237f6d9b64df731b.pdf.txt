Given the fact that OA is a mechanical problem , the effect of the extracellular calcium level ( [ Ca 2 + ] ) on the mechanical behavior of primary human OA chondrocytes remains to be elucidated . Here , we measured the elastic modulus and cell – ECM adhesion forces of human primary chondrocytes with atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) at different extracellular calcium ion concentration ( [ Ca 2 + ] ) levels . With the [ Ca 2 + ] level increasing from the normal baseline level , the elastic modulus of chondrocytes showed a trend of an increase and a subsequent decrease at the level of [ Ca 2 + ] , reaching 2 . 75 mM . The maximum increment of the elastic modulus of chondrocytes is a 37 % increase at the peak point . The maximum unbinding force of cell - ECM adhesion increased by up to 72 % at the peak point relative to the baseline level . qPCR and immunoﬂuorescence also indicated that dose - dependent changes in the expression of myosin and integrin β 1 due to the elevated [ Ca 2 + ] may be responsible for the variations in cell stiffness and cell - ECM adhesion . Scratch assay showed that the chondrocyte migration ability was modulated by cell stiffness and cell - ECM adhesion : as chondrocyte’s elastic modulus and cell - ECM adhesion force increased , the migration speed of chondrocytes decreased . Taken together , our results showed that [ Ca 2 + ] could regulate chondrocytes stiffness and cell - ECM adhesion , and consequently , inﬂuence cell migration , which is critical in cartilage repair . Keywords : extracellular calcium ion ; elastic modulus ; adhesion ; migration 1 . Introduction Osteoarthritis ( OA ) is a common joint disorder and a leading cause of physical disabil - ity ; one of its characteristics is articular cartilage degeneration [ 1 ] . There is no effective way to cure OA at present , despite its negative impacts on patients’ life quality . There are many risk factors of OA , including but not limited to obesity , aging , genetics , and trauma to the joint [ 2 , 3 ] . Abnormal extracellular calcium ion concentration was reported in osteoarthritic cartilage and in severe OA cases where calcium crystals were found in the joint ﬂuid and hyaline articular cartilage of patients [ 4 – 6 ] . Therefore , extracellular calcium ( [ Ca 2 + ] ) may play an important role in OA pathogenesis [ 7 ] . Furthermore , in the synovial ﬂuid , the [ Ca 2 + ] of OA patients was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the healthy people [ 8 , 9 ] . Chondrocytes , the sole cell type in cartilage , are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the cartilage matrix and secreting matrix - associated proteins [ 10 ] . Although Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10034 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / ijms221810034 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / ijms Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10034 2 of 14 the concept is still being debated , the movement of chondrocytes in vivo can be inferred from various ﬁndings based on in vitro cell cultures , ex vivo organ cultures and 3D human cartilage , and indications of mobile chondrocytes include the formation and extension of chondrocyte cell processes in the vicinity of cartilage damage and the outgrowth of chondrocytes at the wound margin [ 10 – 13 ] . Since chondrocytes in vivo are surrounded by a proteoglycan - rich pericellular matrix and an extensive collagen network , the migration of chondrocytes is a challenging process involving the deformation of the cell body and coordination of the binding and unbinding of the cell – extracellular matrix ( ECM ) adhesion . Therefore , in this migration process , the mechanical properties of chondrocytes , such as elastic modulus and adhesion , should play an important role . It is known that cells with a higher migration ability are often softer than their coun - terparts , due to their high cytoskeleton deformability [ 14 – 16 ] . Actin ﬁlaments are major components of the cytoskeleton that contribute to cell stiffness and are involved in cell deformation and migration [ 17 ] . Myosins are also important components of the cytoskele - ton and bind with actin ﬁlaments to generate cell contractile forces . Previous studies have demonstrated that calcium ions have an effect on actin and myosin in certain cell types [ 18 ] . For instance , calcium ions control actin organization [ 19 , 20 ] , inﬂuence actin – myosin interac - tion [ 21 ] , and change myosin conformation [ 22 ] . These studies provide us with indications that calcium ions may affect cell stiffness . On the other hand , cells need to be released from their existing adhesion to ECM at the trailing edge and form new adhesions at the leading edge during cell movement [ 23 ] . Cell – ECM adhesions are mediated by integrin ( mainly integrin β 1 ) in chondrocytes [ 24 , 25 ] . Previous reports indicated that calcium ions can regulate integrin - mediated adhesion and cell migration . For example , extracellular calcium ions regulate osteoclast’s integrin expression and change the adhesion , then inﬂuence the cell’s migration [ 26 ] . These results suggest that extracellular calcium ions may also regulate chondrocyte adhesion . However , the effects of increased calcium levels on the mechanical properties and function of chondrocytes are not clear . Therefore , it is reasonable to hypothesize that extracellular calcium ions regulate chon - drocyte’s stiffness and cell – ECM adhesion and further influence cell migration , which may be related to the tissue repair abilities . To test this hypothesis , we measured the elastic modulus of chondrocytes and the cell – ECM adhesion force at a different [ Ca 2 + ] using human primary chondrocytes with atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . We also quantified the migration abilities of chondrocytes and analyzed the cytoskeleton structure . Moreover , several cytoskeleton - related genes and protein expressions were investigated to explore the possible reasons for the observed changes in cell mechanical properties with a different [ Ca 2 + ] . 2 . Results 2 . 1 . Chondrocyte Stiffness The Young’s modulus of human chondrocytes showed an increasing and decreasing trend as calcium ion concentration increased , by up to 36 . 8 % at the peak point . A typical indentation curve , including the approaching segment , holding segment , and retracting segment , for the elastic modulus of chondrocytes cells , was shown in Figure 1A . The Young’s modulus of the cell was obtained from the holding segment and retracting segment of the indentation curves .

With the increase in [ Ca 2 + ] , the ﬂuorescence density decreased by 10 % , from 2 . 75 mM to 3 . 75 mM ( 29 . 5 ± 5 . 8 vs . 26 . 6 ± 5 . 4 , n = 60 , p = 0 . 015 , Figure 6B ) . A similar trend was also observed in myosin ( Figure 6D ) . The ﬂuorescence density was signiﬁcantly increased ( 10 . 9 ± 2 . 1 vs . 15 . 4 ± 1 . 7 and 15 . 5 ± 3 . 2 , n = 60 , p < 0 . 0001 ) by 50 % in the lower [ Ca 2 + ] groups ( 2 . 25 mM and 2 . 75 mM ) , and then signiﬁcantly decreased by 20 % ( 15 . 5 ± 3 . 2 vs . 12 . 6 ± 2 . 4 and 12 . 1 ± 1 . 9 , n = 60 , p < 0 . 0001 ) with the higher [ Ca 2 + ] ( 3 . 25 mM and 3 . 75 mM , Figure 6D ) .

Discussion In recent years , the high concentration of calcium in the joint ﬂuid of OA patients has emerged as an important hallmark in the pathogenesis of OA , and emerged as a critical simulation in cells . Despite its physiological importance , the relationship between a high [ Ca 2 + ] level and chondrocyte mechanics and chondrocyte migration is still ambiguous . In Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10034 8 of 14 this investigation , we measured chondrocyte stiffness and chondrocyte – ECM adhesion and explained their relationship with cell migration . Furthermore , we demonstrated the critical role of myosin and integrin in chondrocyte mechanics and migration . Our work leads to an important advance in the understanding of the role of [ Ca 2 + ] in OA pathogenesis and also helps to reveal the correlation between cell mechanics and cell migration Cell mechanical properties are closely related to cellular activities , such as migration , differentiation , and metastasis [ 14 ] . The nanomechanical characterization of chondrocytes at different extracellular calcium concentrations helps in the observation of the abnormal mechanical properties of chondrocytes between OA and normal cartilage . AFM was em - ployed to measure the mechanical properties of chondrocytes in this study . The indentation depth of the AFM tip was approximately 0 . 5 µ m . At this indentation depth , the elastic modulus is mainly determined by the cortical cytoskeleton , which is comprised of actin ﬁlaments and myosin , with a thickness of approximately 50 – 200 nm [ 14 , 27 , 28 ] . Cortical actin ﬁlaments interact with myosin , which is responsible for maintaining the contractile force . When the [ Ca 2 + ] level changes , the cell can detect small ﬂuctuations in the calcium level and respond by regulating actin and myosin [ 29 ] . Actin and myosin can be regulated by calcium in several different ways . Firstly , increasing [ Ca 2 + ] induces an inﬂux of calcium ions and then causes a cascade of calcium signals [ 30 ] . Intracellular calcium ions regulate actin arrangement , altering the mechanical properties and migration of cells [ 31 , 32 ] . Cal - cium plays a role in the phosphorylation of myosin and regulates myosin – actin interactions in non - muscle mammalian cells [ 22 , 33 ] . Secondly , changes in [ Ca 2 + ] will cause variations in the expression of skeletal - related genes , mediated by calcium - sensitive receptors , leading to the re - arrangement of F - actin [ 34 , 35 ] . In the present study , increasing the [ Ca 2 + ] level induces the expression of myosin to increase from 1 . 75 mM to 2 . 75 mM , and decrease from 2 . 75 mM to 3 . 75 mM , which can be responsible for the alternation in the chondrocyte stiffness . Santos - Argumedo et al . also reported that the decrease in cell elastic modulus after myosin was due to knockout [ 36 ] . The immunoﬂuorescence and Western blot ex - periments conﬁrmed that the expression of myosin is nearly in accordance with its gene expression results . Cell – ECM adhesion forces were measured by an AFM tip coated with the chondro - cyte extracellular matrix . Cell – ECM adhesion is mainly mediated by transmembrane protein integrin , which contains 24 heterodimers , formed of β subunits and α subunits . As chondrocyte ECM mainly consists of collagen II and aggrecan , the adhesion is principally mediated by integrins β 1 subunits , such as α 1 β 1 , α 2 β 1 and α 10 β 1 in chondrocytes [ 25 ] . In the present study , adhesion forces and detachment work varied with [ Ca 2 + ] , and the patterns were consistent with the expression of integrin β 1 . A higher expression level of integrin suggests that there may be more molecular binding to ECM , producing stronger adhesion forces that require more energy to break during detachment . Our results demon - strate that cell – ECM adhesion can be regulated by the extracellular calcium concentration , through integrin β 1 . Calcium ions may regulate integrin in the following ways . Firstly , integrin - mediated adhesion can be regulated by calcium signals from inside and outside the cells . Integrin mediates calcium signaling from the extracellular domain ( ‘outside - in’ signaling ) , and then activates intracellular signal pathways . Intracellular feedback signals subsequently regulate integrin - mediated adhesion ( ‘inside - out’ signaling ) [ 37 , 38 ] . Secondly , the regulation of Ca 2 + to integrin presents a bipolar trend and Ca 2 + plays an im - portant role in stabilizing the integrin structure to mediate integrin - ligand binding . There are three or four Ca 2 + binding sites in integrin , which regulate integrin – ligand binding afﬁnity . Calcium ions bind to integrin and change the conformation , thus inﬂuencing the integrin – ligand binding afﬁnity [ 39 ] . The previous ligand binding assay demonstrated that when calcium ion is in a lower concentration , Ca 2 + binds with ligand - binding sites such as ligand - associated metal - binding site ( LIMBS ) and metal - ion dependent adhesion site ( MIDAS ) , and plays a positive role in integrin – ligand adhesion . When calcium ion increases to a higher concentration level ( 1 – 10 mM ) , Ca 2 + binds with a ligand - bind site such as ADMIDAS ( adjacent to MIDAS ) , and plays a negative role in integrin – ligand Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10034 9 of 14 adhesion [ 40 , 41 ] . In this study , as Ca 2 + remains at a high concentration , Ca 2 + binds with ADMIDAS , causing an integrin to remain at a low level of afﬁnity and present a smaller detachment force . Taken together , the expression of integrin and integrin afﬁnity changes , causing cell – ECM adhesion , presents a bipolar trend in a calcium concentration ranging from 2 . 75 mM to 3 . 75 mM . To further verify the integrin’s impact on the mediation of cell – ECM adhesion , CWHM - 12 was used to inhibit integrin [ 42 ] . The sharp drop in the adhesion forces and W d after CWHM - 12 treatment demonstrated that integrin is the main molecular in the mediation of chondrocyte – ECM adhesion . Cell migration is a complex process that underlies tissue formation , maintenance and regeneration . Each cell type employs a particular migration manner in a given en - vironment [ 43 ] . There are numerous factors that can affect cell migration , such as ECM architecture , cell – cell interactions , the property of the individual cell , etc . ECM architecture , such as 2D and 3D culture environments , can also inﬂuence the cell migration process . The migration of chondrocytes cultured in a 3D environment normally has the following steps : edge protrusion , integrin - mediated focal interactions to the substrate , actomyosin - mediated cell contraction and rear - end retraction [ 44 ] . In a 2D environment , chondrocyte migration requires unilateral adhesion to the substrate and the formation of a transient but stable - enough adhesion , led by a leading lamellipodia [ 45 , 46 ] . Both 2D and 3D migration manners involve cell deformation and cell detachment . Usually , cells with lower stiffness are easier to deform during migration , and higher cell motility usually corresponds with a lower stiffness [ 14 ] . High integrin expression levels are correlated with high attachment forces , and high detachment forces and a relatively slower dissociation rate at the trailing edge of the cell [ 47 , 48 ] . In the present study , when the [ Ca 2 + ] increased from 1 . 75 mM to 2 . 75 mM , both the elastic modulus and the adhesion forces of chondrocytes increased , resulting in a decreased migration ability in chondrocytes . When [ Ca 2 + ] increased from 2 . 75 mM to 3 . 75 mM , the opposite effects were seen in the chondrocytes’ elastic modulus , adhesion forces , and cell migration ability . There are several limitations to the present study . As mentioned above , the migration pattern of cells in the 2D environment is different from that in the 3D environment . In the present study , chondrocytes were cultured in a 2D petri dish , so the migration was not fully consistent with the physiological environment . Some studies have shown that chondrocytes have relatively weak migration abilities . The apparent cell migration in vivo predominantly occurred in the collagen ﬁbril orientation , and occurred at a slower rate than other mammalian cells in 2D culture [ 10 ] . The primary culture of chondrocytes isolated from human cartilage has been a useful model for studies of related diseases . However , chondrocytes cultured in monolayer tended towards de - differentiation and the cartilage - speciﬁc phenotype could not be maintained with the passage of time . Mature articular chondrocytes expressed type II collagen and aggrecan as markers and de - differentiated chondrocytes presented a ﬁbroblastic phenotype . In the present study , the expression results of collagen I and collagen II indicated that chondrocytes were slightly de - differentiated at the fourth day , but the effect was not severe . When cultured for 12 days , the ratio of collagen I to collagen II was in the dozens , which indicated that the chondrocytes’ de - differentiation became severe . The expression levels of collagen II and aggrecan in each group were almost the same , which indicated that [ Ca 2 + ] does not signiﬁcantly affect chondrocytes’ differentiation ( Figure S2 ) . Taken together , the mechanical properties of chondrocytes are closely related to various important biological behaviors , such as migration and proliferation . Multitudinous stimuli factors from intracellular and extracellular domains can inﬂuence the chondrocyte’s mechanical properties and regulate its biological behavior . Calcium’s involvement in intracellular signal transduction in cells has been demonstrated . In this study , we measured the elastic modulus and cell – ECM adhesion force of chondrocytes cultured in vitro using AFM . The measured results suggested that alterations in the calcium concentration level signiﬁcantly inﬂuence cell stiffness and adhesion , as well as cell migration . In the present study , calcium concentrations were chosen according to the calcium concentration in the Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10034 10 of 14 synovial ﬂuid of patients with knee osteoarthritis . The results provide solid evidence that the abnormal calcium concentration found in pathological OA conditions could play an important role in the progression of OA . Therefore , targeting calcium concentration might be a promising way of treating OA . 4 . Materials and Methods 4 . 1 . Cell Isolation and Cell Culture Primary articular chondrocytes were obtained from the knee cartilage of OA patients ( n = 3 , male 62Y , female 64Y , and female 65Y ) after total knee arthroplasty with IRB approval . Cartilage tissues used for chondrocytes isolation were chosen from those that were intact according to Osteoarthritis Research Society International ( OARSI ) criteria . Cartilage tissues were washed three times with PBS and cut into 1 mm 3 pieces . The collected tissues were digested for 30 min in 0 . 25 % trypsin ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) at 37 ◦ C , and the solution was replaced by 0 . 15 % type II collagenase ( Gibco , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) in high - glucose DMEM ( Gibco , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) for 4 h at 37 ◦ C . After digestion , the solution was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min ; then , the supernatant was removed and high - glucose DMEM was supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Gibco , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) , before 1 % penicillin - streptomycin was added . The obtained chondrocytes were cultured at 37 ◦ C with 5 % CO 2 . Four days later , the media was replaced and then changed three times per week . All cells were used within two passages . 4 . 2 . AFM Nanoindentation After 3 days of incubation , the elastic modulus of chondrocytes was measured by an AFM ( JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) . Three separate dish samples were used for each group of mechanical measurements . The silicon - nitride AFM tip ( NT - MDT , Zelenograd , Russia ) was milled into a ﬂat - end cylinder shape with 2 . 2 µ m diameter , fabricated using a focus ion beam ( FEI company , Hillsboro , OR , USA ) . The spring constant of the tip was calibrated using the integrated thermal noise module of AFM , and was 0 . 048 N / m . The indentation was performed by controlling the piezoelectric sample stage movement . First , the stage was extended to 8 µ m with a speed of 1 µ m / s , and then held for 20 s , followed by a retraction of 8 µ m at a speed of 1 µ m / s . Since a rather soft AFM tip was used , the actual indentation depth of the tip into the sample was around 0 . 5 µ m . The cell height was around 6 µ m , measured by a confocal laser scanning microscope before the experiment ( Figure S4 ) . The indentation location was at the center of the cell . As the cells are known to be highly viscoelastic , to minimize the viscous effects during measurements , in this study , we employed our previously established rate - jump model for mechanical data analysis [ 49 , 50 ] . The elastic modulus was calculated by the Equation [ 50 ] : ∆ . δ ∆ . D = A (cid:18) 1 + k 2 aE r (cid:19) ( 1 ) where ∆ . δ is the net of piezoelectric sample stage speed just before and after the retraction and ∆ . D is the corresponding rate change in the recorded photodiode signal D . a is the tip - sample contact radius , and is equal to the tip radius of the ﬂat punch tip used . 4 . 3 . Cell Adhesion Measurement Chondrocytes ECM was extracted from the disposed knee cartilage tissue after total joint replacement . The minced cartilage samples were suspended in distilled water and homogenized with a homogenizer , before the tissue suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected [ 51 ] . To enhance its hydrophilic qualities , the AFM tip was treated with plasma machine ( Tonson High - Tech Automation Equipment Co . , Ltd . , Shenzhen , China ) under an O 2 atmosphere for 1 min . The treated AFM tip was immediately submerged in the supernatant for 15 min to obtain the ECM - coated AFM tip . To obtain the adhesion behavior of chondrocytes with ECM , the ECM - coated AFM tip was brought Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10034 11 of 14 into contact with chondrocytes for 20 s , before being retracted at a speed of 1 µ m / s . The AFM height and pulling forces were recorded . Three separate samples were used for each group of mechanical measurements . The maximum unbinding forces between ECM and the cell , and the detachment work , were measured by JPKSPM Data Processing ( version : smp - 5 . 0 . 135 , JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) . An uncoated tip was set as a control group . In the integrin - inhibiting experiment , 10 nM CWHM - 12 ( MedChemExpress , NJ , USA ) was added to the culture media 30 min before measurement . The AFM operation procedures were the same as above . 4 . 4 . Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope Observation After 3 - days incubation with culture media containing different [ Ca 2 + ] , chondrocytes were washed three times with PBS and ﬁxed by 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min . Then , chondrocytes were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized by 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma , Saint Louis , MO , USA ) for 10 min . Next , chondrocytes were washed three times and incubated with 200 µ M phalloidin - TRITC ( Sigma , Saint Louis , MO , USA ) for 40 min . After being washed with PBS , samples were incubated with Antifade Solution including DAPI ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) for 1 h . For myosin and integrin immunoﬂuorescence staining , after washing three times with PBS and ﬁxed by 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) for 20 min , samples were incubated with 10 % goat serum ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) for 30 min . Then , chondrocytes were incubated with primary antibodies , none - muscle myosin IIB ( Boster , Wuhan , China , 1 : 400 dilution ) and integrin beta 1 ( Bioss , Beijing , China , 1 : 400 dilution ) in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA , Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) overnight for 4 ◦ C . Samples were then incubated with the secondary antibody ( Cy3 labeled , Sigma , Saint Louis , MO , USA ) for two hours at 37 ◦ C . All images were captured under the same conditions . The mean intensity of the F - actin was measured by ImageJ software ( version : version : 1 . 53K ; National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . 4 . 5 . Quantitative Real - Time PCR After 3 days of incubation with culture media containing different [ Ca 2 + ] , chondro - cytes mRNA was collected and puriﬁed using RNAiso Plus ( TaKaRa , Dalian , China ) . The mRNA was dissolved in DEPC - treated water and quantiﬁed using Nanodrop ( Ther - moFisher , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Then , mRNA was transcribed to cDNA using the cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) . The gene expression levels were detected with an SYBR Green real - time PCR Master Mix kit ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) and performed on an Applied Biosystems , StepOnePlus Instrument ( Thermoﬁsher , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . The gene expression levels were normalized by β - actin ; 2 − ∆∆ ct was calculated by referring to the 1 . 25 mM calcium ion group . All the primers were shown in Table S2 . 4 . 6 . Wound Healing Assay The migration ability of chondrocytes at different [ Ca 2 + ] levels was investigated by a wound - healing assay . The ECM solution was employed to clean the used six - well plate for 10 min . Chondrocytes were seeded on the dried six - well plate with culture media containing different [ Ca 2 + ] . When cells reached full conﬂuence , the cell monolayer was scratched with a 100 µ L pipette tip . Images were captured right after scratching ( 0 h ) and 48 h later using a Leica DMi8 microscope . The images were analyzed with ImageJ software . Six areas were selected to measure the width of the scratched area , and the migration distance was obtained by the decrease in the wound width for 48 h . 4 . 7 . Western Blot After 3 days incubation with a culture medium containing [ Ca 2 + ] , chondrocyte pro - teins were collected with RIPA buffer . The total protein concentrations were measured by BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Beyotime , Shanghai , China ) . The primary antibodies are shown Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2021 , 22 , 10034 12 of 14 below : anti - integrin beta 1 antibody ( Abcam , MA , USA ) , anti - beta Actin antibody ( Abcam , Boston , MA , USA ) , anti - non - muscle Myosin IIB / MYH10 antibody ( Boster , Wuhan , China ) . 4 . 8 . Statistical Analysis All the experiments were carried out independently and in triplicate , and all data were expressed as mean ± SD . Statistical analysis was carried out using ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc in Graphpad ( version : 8 . 0 , GraphPad Software Inc . , San Diego , CA , USA ) ; if a p - value was less than 0 . 05 , it was considered statistically signiﬁcant . The results of the wound - healing assay and ﬂuorescence staining were quantiﬁed by ImageJ software . 5 . Conclusions In the current study , we investigated the effect of the cell elastic modulus and cell – ECM adhesion under the inﬂuence of the extracellular calcium ions in the human primary chondrocytes . We found that chondrocyte migration in vitro was regulated by extracellular calcium ions by modulating cell stiffness and cell – ECM adhesion . With the pathological increase in extracellular calcium ions , the elastic modulus and cell – ECM adhesion forces of the chondrocytes initially increase , followed by a decrease . Under the inﬂuence of the mechanical property of the chondrocytes , chondrocyte migration also shows the same pattern , and is affected by the extracellular calcium ions . The expression of myosin II and integrin β 1 may be responsible for the aforementioned changes . Lastly , we believe that the ﬁndings in the study will help provide a better understanding of the role of calcium in chondrocyte function and possible OA progression .
