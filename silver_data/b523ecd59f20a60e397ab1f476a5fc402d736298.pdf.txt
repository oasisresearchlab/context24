Membrane buckling induced by curved ﬁlaments Martin Lenz , 1 , ∗ Daniel J . G . Crow , 1 and Jean - Fran¸cois Joanny 1 1 Institut Curie , Centre de Recherche , Laboratoire Physico - Chimie Curie , Paris , F - 75248 France ; CNRS , UMR 168 , Paris , F - 75248 France ; Universit´e Pierre et Marie Curie - Paris6 , UMR 168 , Paris , F - 75005 France ( Dated : July 16 , 2009 ) We present a novel buckling instability relevant to membrane budding in eukaryotic cells . In this mechanism , curved ﬁlaments bind to a lipid bilayer without changing its intrinsic curvature . As more and more ﬁlaments adsorb , newly added ones are more and more strained , which destabilizes the ﬂat membrane . We perform a linear stability analysis of ﬁlament - dressed membranes and ﬁnd that the buckling threshold is within reasonable in vivo parameter values . We account for the formation of long tubes previously observed in cells and in puriﬁed systems . We study strongly deformed dressed membranes and their bifurcation diagram numerically . Our mechanism could be validated by a simple experiment . Eukaryotic cells are highly compartmentalized , and many of their conﬁning structures are made of lipid bi - layers . In order to maintain the exchanges essential for their proper functioning , cells thus need tools that mod - ulate the shape and topology of these membranes . Such tools may be proteins that self - assemble to form tubes in solution [ 1 ] and can impose this intrinsic tubular shape on membranes [ 2 ] . In some other physically interest - ing cases , the structure of the protein does not suggest an obvious tubulation mechanism , as for the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport III ( ESCRT - III ) [ 3 ] . This protein complex is implicated in the for - mation of multivesicular bodies [ 4 ] , HIV budding [ 5 ] and cytokinesis [ 6 ] , three processes which involve deforma - tion of the membrane into a bud and / or severing oﬀ the resulting membrane protrusion from the inside . Deep - etch electron micrographs of COS - 7 cells overexpressing hSnf - 7 , one of the constitutive proteins of ESCRT - III , re - veal circular arrays of curved hSnf - 7 polymers under the plasma membrane [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] [ 7 ] . This is evidence of the strong aﬃnity of these ﬁlaments for the membrane [ 8 ] and for each other [ 9 ] , as well as of their intrinsic curvature . When an ATP - hydrolysis deﬁcient mutant of VPS4 —an ATPase involved in the disassembly of ESCRT - III ﬁla - ments [ 9 , 10 ] — is present , long membrane - covered tubes of hSnf - 7 ﬁlaments are observed [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] . Similar struc - tures appear in in vitro systems using puriﬁed proteins [ 11 ] . This suggests that tubes always form in vivo , but that in the presence of normal VPS4 alone they are im - mediately cut oﬀ the membrane to form vesicles . In this Letter we propose that this ﬂat - to - tubular transition is a general feature of systems where curved ﬁlaments with attractive interactions bind to a membrane , and study this physical eﬀect akin to the buckling of a rod ( Fig . 1 ) . We consider an inﬁnite , initially ﬂat lipid bilayer parametrized by its radial coordinate r . A subdomain r i < r < r e of this surface is bound to an array of ﬁla - ments ( Fig . 1 ) . The dressed membrane is then put into contact with the cytoplasm , which acts as a reservoir of ﬁlaments . In the following , we consider only axisym - metric conﬁgurations [ 19 ] and assume that the dressed membrane is very thin . We write the free energy of the dressed membrane as : F = (cid:90) r ∈ R + (cid:16) κ 2 c 2 + σ (cid:17) d A + 2 πγ ( r i + r e ) + (cid:90) r ∈ [ r i , r e ] (cid:34) k 2 (cid:18) 1 r − 1 r 0 (cid:19) 2 − µ (cid:35) d A . ( 1 ) The ﬁrst term is the Helfrich free energy of the mem - brane , with bending modulus κ , local total curvature c and tension σ [ 12 ] . The second term represents the at - tractive interactions between ﬁlaments , characterized by a line tension γ . We assume that the ﬁlaments are closely packed ; their surface density is thus constant through - out the array . The last term represents the free energy of the ﬁlaments . They have a preferred curvature r − 1 0 , and due to the cylindrical symmetry their actual curva - Figure 1 : ( color online ) Illustration of the proposed buckling mechanism . Overbent ﬁlaments are represented in blue , un - derbent ﬁlaments in red and the membrane in yellow . Wedges of the membrane were removed for visualization . ( a ) Curved ﬁlaments with an aﬃnity for each other and the membrane form membrane - bound circular arrays . The tension and bend - ing modulus of the membrane tend to stabilize ﬂat arrays . ( b ) Buckling , on the other hand , allows the binding of more ﬁlaments and the relaxation of those already bound to their preferred ( yellow ) radius . These stabilizing and destabilizing eﬀects balance at the buckling threshold . ( c ) The formation of long tubes allows the binding of an arbitrarily large number of ﬁlaments close to their preferred radius . a r X i v : 0 9 03 . 3363v2 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 1 6 J u l 2009 2 ture is r − 1 . A Taylor expansion about r − 1 0 to second order yields the ﬁlament stiﬀness k . We denote by µ the chemical potential diﬀerence between hSnf - 7 in the cyto - plasm and bound to the membrane . In vivo , the circular ﬁlaments pictured in Fig . 1 are not actually continuous and can be made of several consecutive shorter ﬁlaments . It is also possible that the hSnf - 7 ﬁlaments are “living” polymers and exchange monomers with the cytoplasm . Therefore we consider that ﬁlaments of any length are always available , and that their chemical potential per monomer does not depend on their length , so that µ is uniform throughout the ﬁlament array . We ignore holes in the array resulting from thermal ﬂuctuation , which is correct in the limit of large binding energies [ 20 ] . Eq . ( 1 ) also ignores the up - down asymmetry of the dressed mem - brane , a simpliﬁcation discussed later . Finally , we deﬁne the scaled ﬁlament stiﬀness K = k / κ and membrane ten - sion Σ = ( σ − µ ) r 20 / κ + k / ( 2 κ ) . We ﬁrst consider the stability of ﬂat arrays of ﬁla - ments [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] . In Ref . [ 7 ] , it is observed that these arrays have a ﬁnite , rather well - deﬁned external radius r e . We attribute this feature to a chemical equilibrium between hSnf - 7 in the array and in solution . Minimizing F with respect to r e for a ﬂat membrane ( c = 0 and d A = 2 πr dr ) , one ﬁnds that the array has a ﬁnite ex - ternal equilibrium radius only if k / 2 r 20 > µ , i . e . only if it is more favorable for a ﬁlament to be in solution than bound to the rim of a very large ( r e → + ∞ ) array . Line tension will shrink the array and make r e vanish unless γ < k r 0 (cid:32) 1 − (cid:114) 1 − 2 µr 20 k (cid:33) . ( 2 ) Under these assumptions we always have 0 < r i < r e and r e r 0 = k − r 0 γ k − 2 r 20 µ + (cid:115)(cid:18) k − r 0 γ k − 2 r 20 µ (cid:19) 2 − k k − 2 r 20 µ . ( 3 ) We now discuss the buckling of ﬁlament - dressed mem - branes [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . Experimentally , it is observed that the typical length scale of a hSnf - 7 protrusion is much larger than r i and smaller than r e . We therefore assume for simplicity that r i = 0 and r e → + ∞ . We parametrize the dressed membrane by its altitude z ( r ) . The equilib - rium states are the solutions of the force balance equa - tion δ F δz ( r ) = 0 with boundary conditions dzdr ( 0 ) = 0 and dzdr ( + ∞ ) = 0 . Therefore , z ( r ) is deﬁned up to an ar - bitrary additive constant . As in the case of a buckling rod [ 13 ] , the buckling threshold is the set of parameters where non - zero solutions of the linearized force balance equation satisfying the boundary conditions exist . This equation reads : z (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) + z (cid:48)(cid:48) R − (cid:18) 1 4 − 1 + √ 4 + 2 K + 2 ν 2 R + 2 + K 2 R 2 (cid:19) z (cid:48) = 0 , ( 4 ) where the primes denote diﬀerentiation with respect to the scaled radius R = r / u , and u = r 0 2 √ Σ , ν = K 2 √ Σ − (cid:114) 1 + K 2 − 1 2 . ( 5 ) The general solution of Eq . ( 4 ) reads z (cid:48) ( R ) = c 1 f 1 ( R ) + c 2 f 2 ( R ) , where c 1 and c 2 are arbitrary constants and f 1 ( R ) = e − R / 2 R √ 1 + K / 2 U (cid:16) − ν , 1 + √ 4 + 2 K , R (cid:17) , f 2 ( R ) = e − R / 2 R √ 1 + K / 2 M (cid:16) − ν , 1 + √ 4 + 2 K , R (cid:17) . ( 6 ) The conﬂuent hypergeometric functions of the second kind U and M are deﬁned in Ref . [ 14 ] . Non - zero so - lutions of this form satisfying the boundary conditions only exist for certain values of the parameters , thereby deﬁning the buckling threshold . Two parameter regimes must be distinguished : - For ν / ∈ N , we have the following asymptotic behaviors : f 1 ( R ) ∼ R → 0 Γ (cid:0) √ 4 + 2 K (cid:1) Γ ( − ν ) R − √ 1 + K / 2 , f 2 ( R ) ∼ R → + ∞ Γ (cid:0) 1 + √ 4 + 2 K (cid:1) Γ ( − ν ) R − 1 − ν − √ 1 + K / 2 e R / 2 . ( 7 ) Thus f 1 diverges as R → 0 while Eq . ( 6 ) implies f 2 ( 0 ) = 0 . Hence the boundary condition z (cid:48) ( 0 ) = 0 imposes c 1 = 0 . Similarly , f 2 ( R ) diverges as R → + ∞ , thus z (cid:48) ( + ∞ ) = 0 yields c 2 = 0 . Therefore there is no non - zero solution to the linearized buckling problem . - For ν = n ∈ N , the singular terms of Eq . ( 7 ) vanish and f 1 and f 2 are both proportional to the generalized Laguerre polynomials L ( α ) n ( R ) [ 14 ] . Hence Eq . ( 4 ) has a unique solution , up to an arbitrary amplitude C : z (cid:48) n ( R ) = C e − R / 2 R √ 1 + K / 2 L ( √ 4 + 2 K ) n ( R ) . ( 8 ) Since L ( α ) n ( R ) is a polynomial of degree n in R , z (cid:48) n satisﬁes the boundary conditions for any n . Therefore , there is an inﬁnity of buckling thresholds , one per integer ν = n . This is again reminiscent of the buckling rod problem , as each normal mode z n of the dressed membrane has its own instability threshold ( Fig . 2 ) . In the following we only consider the most unstable mode n = 0 . We now study strongly deformed dressed membranes [ Fig . 1 ( c ) ] . We ﬁrst check that our model accounts for the existence of long dressed membrane tubes similar to those observed in Refs . [ 7 , 10 , 11 ] . For a cylindrical pro - trusion of radius r t and length (cid:96) (cid:29) r t , one can neglect the rounded tip and base of the tube . Introducing a ﬁc - titious vertical point force f pulling the membrane up at r = 0 , we minimize the free energy G = F − f(cid:96) with respect to r t and (cid:96) and ﬁnd r t = r 0 (cid:114) 1 + K 2Σ , f t = 2 πκ r 0 (cid:104) (cid:112) 2 ( 1 + K ) Σ − K (cid:105) .

( b ) Thin black lines : buckling thresholds as a function of n , K and Σ . Thick black line : stability limit of long , cylin - drical dressed membrane tubes . Protrusions are obviously more stable at small Σ , where the destabilizing inﬂuence of the ﬁlaments overrides the stabilizing eﬀect of the membrane . Therefore the n th normal mode of the ﬂat dressed membrane is linearly unstable for parameter regimes located under the n th thin black line and long tubes exist only under the thick black line . Thin cyan ( grey ) line : parameter regimes com - patible with the experimental data of Ref . [ 7 ] . Symbols are referred to in the main text . Consider an equilibrium situation in which a long dressed membrane tube is held at a constant length by a force f = f t . The force is then suddenly set to zero . In the case of an upward initial force f t > 0 , the tube tends to retract . If f t < 0 , on the contrary , (cid:96) increases and the dressed membrane spontaneously tubulates . This corre - sponds to the region of Fig . 2 ( b ) located under the thick black line . Interestingly , long tubes are always stable when the ﬂat dressed membrane is linearly unstable , but the reverse is not true . Thus there exists a regime , lo - cated between the thick black line and the n = 0 line of Fig . 2 ( b ) , where the ﬂat dressed membrane is metastable . This regime is compatible with biologically reasonable parameter values . Indeed , combining Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) , one ﬁnds : Σ = 2 ( κr e r t ) 2 K 2 ( 1 + K ) [ κr 2 e + 2 ( γ − σr e ) r e r 2 t + κ ( r 2 e + r 2 t ) K ] 2 . ( 10 ) Inserting r t (cid:39) 70 nm and r e (cid:39) 200 nm [ 7 ] and the es - timates κ = 20 k B T , σ = 10 − 5 N . m − 1 and γ = 1 pN in this equation , we obtain a numerical relation between the scaled tension and ﬁlament stiﬀness characterizing the experiments of Ref . [ 7 ] . We plot this condition as a thin cyan ( grey ) line on Fig . 2 ( b ) . This line traverses both the metastable and unstable regions , making it possible that the experiments of Ref . [ 7 ] reﬂect either regime . We consider the possibility that the ﬂat dressed mem - branes observed in Ref . [ 7 ] are indeed metastable . In this hypothesis , an important quantity is the energy barrier ∆ F separating the ﬂat state from the more stable , tubu - lated state . To compute ∆ F , we numerically solve the full nonlinear shape equation of the tube on a ﬁnite do - main 0 < R < 25 [ 15 ] . Using Z = z / u , we deﬁne S as the arc length along the dressed membrane in the ( R , Z ) plane [ Fig . 3 ( a ) ] . We parametrize the dressed membrane by R ( S ) and the angle ψ ( S ) deﬁned by ˙ R ( S ) = cos ψ ( S ) , ˙ Z ( S ) = − sin ψ ( S ) , ( 11 ) where the dots denote the diﬀerentiation with respect to S . Minimization of the free energy G yields the shape equation of the dressed membrane : ¨ ψ = (cid:18) 1 4 − 1 + √ 4 + 2 K + 2 ν 2 R + cos 2 ψ + 1 + K 2 R 2 (cid:19) tan ψ − ˙ ψ 2 tan ψ 2 − ˙ ψ cos ψ R − F R cos ψ , ( 12 ) where F = fu / ( 2 πκ ) . This equation is identical to Eq . ( 4 ) in the small - ψ limit and to the bare membrane tube shape equation in the absence of protein ( k = 0 , µ = 0 ) [ 15 ] . In the following , we discuss the speciﬁc ex - ample K = 2 . 5 , but we believe that other values of K yield a similar behavior . Let us ﬁrst comment on the three regimes presented in Fig . 3 ( a - b ) . For Σ = 1 . 1 [ in - dicated by (cid:52) in Fig . 2 ( b ) ] , tubes always retract in the absence of an external force , as shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) . Low - ering the surface tension to Σ = 0 . 89 ( (cid:3) ) , one reaches the boundary of the metastable region . For 0 . 39 < Σ < 0 . 89 , a positive force is required to extract short tubes , but long tubes grow spontaneously unless opposed by a neg - ative F . At Σ = 0 . 39 ( (cid:13) ) and lower , even short tubes grow spontaneously and can be maintained at a ﬁnite length only by a negative force . In Fig . 3 ( b ) , crossings of the horizontal axis by the force - extension curves denote solutions of the biologically relevant , F = 0 problem , the stability of which is indicated by the sign of the curve’s slope . Plotting the lengths of these protrusions as a func - tion of Σ , we obtain the diagram Fig . 3 ( c ) , where we ob - serve that the loss of stability of the n = 0 mode studied above yields a subcritical bifurcation . Focusing on the metastable regime ( 0 . 39 < Σ < 0 . 89 ) , we note that form - ing an inﬁnitely long tube requires ﬁrst extruding a short tube from the dressed membrane , which is energetically unfavorable . The associated energy barrier ∆ F is given by the free energy of the unstable solutions represented by the main thin branch of Fig . 3 ( c ) . Integrating force - extension curves similar to those of Fig . 3 ( b ) , we calcu - late the work required to reach these solutions from the metastable , ﬂat state and plot the results on Fig . 3 ( d ) . Under the eﬀect of thermal ﬂuctuations , an energy bar - rier of height ∆ F is crossed at a rate τ − 1 e − ∆ F / k B T , where τ ∼ ns is the characteristic relaxation time scale of the system . When ∆ F is of the order of a few k B T , thermal ﬂuctuations are suﬃcient to ensure the buckling of the dressed membrane within experimentally observ - able time scales . This is , however , not the case here , and the large energy barrier makes thermally activated ESCRT - III - mediated budding extremely unlikely in most 4 Figure 3 : ( color online ) Numerically computed mechani - cal properties of strongly deformed dressed membranes for K = 2 . 5 .

( d ) Activation energy ∆ F a ﬂat dressed membrane needs to reach the (cid:96) = + ∞ buckled solution . of the metastable regime . Therefore , in vivo , ESCRT - III - mediated budding either takes place only in ( or close to ) the regime where the ﬂat dressed membrane is lin - early unstable , or is assisted by some unknown active process ( e . g . actin polymerization , which is regulated by the ESCRT - associated protein Alix [ 16 ] ) . We now comment on two approximations used throughout this work . First , we assumed that the in - teractions between ﬁlaments and between ﬁlament and membrane are independent of the slope of the dressed membrane ( i . e . of whether the ﬁlaments lie in the same plane or are stacked upon another ) . For small slopes , this dependence can be expanded as µ ( ∇ z ) = µ 0 + µ 2 ( ∇ z ) 2 / 2 + O (cid:2) ( ∇ z ) 4 (cid:3) and yields the same lin - ear stability analysis as above provided we redeﬁne Σ = ( σ − µ 0 − µ 2 ) r 2 0 / κ + k / ( 2 κ ) . Second , we ignored in Eq . ( 1 ) any terms violating the z → − z spatial symmetry . These terms are allowed in general since the dressed membrane is not up - down symmetric , and might be responsible for the fact that buckling systematically occurs toward the outside of the cytoplasm [ 7 ] . Formally , such an asymme - try destroys the bifurcation studied here . If it is weak , however , a stable , almost ﬂat conﬁguration still exists for high tensions and loses stability close to the predicted Σ = 0 . 39 threshold , as illustrated in Fig . 3 ( c ) . Finally , we believe that a better understanding of ESCRT - III - mediated budding could be gained by study - ing it experimentally in the absence of any active pro - cess . We propose an in vitro setup where an aspiration pipette is used to control the tension σ of a giant unil - amellar vesicle [ 17 ] . Introducing ESCRT - III proteins in the surrounding solution at a known concentration ( and therefore at known µ ) [ 11 ] , one could vary Σ through σ and directly measure the buckling threshold and its de - pendence on µ . Due to the existence of the metastable region , we also predict a hysteretic behavior . In this Letter we presented a novel buckling mechanism relevant for a wide range of systems involving interacting membranes and curved ﬁlaments ( possibly including e . g . the one studied in Ref . [ 18 ] ) . Our robust qualitative and quantitative predictions can be tested in rather simple in vitro experiments and could shed light on the biological problem of ESCRT - III - mediated budding .
