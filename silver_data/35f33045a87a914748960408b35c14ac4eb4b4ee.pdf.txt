Data on social contact patterns are widely used to parameterise age - mixing matrices in mathematical models of infectious diseases designed to help understand transmission patterns or estimate intervention impacts . Despite this , little attention is given to how social contact data are collected and analysed , or how the types of contact most relevant for transmission may vary between different infections . In particular , the majority of studies focus on close contacts only – people spoken to face - to - face . This may be appropriate for infections spread primarily by droplet transmission , but it neglects the larger numbers of ‘shared air’ casual contacts who may be at risk from airborne transmission of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis , measles , and SARS - CoV - 2 . Methods . We conducted social contact surveys in communities in two provinces of South Africa in 2019 ( KwaZulu - Natal and Western Cape ) . In line with most studies , we collected data on people spoken to ( close contacts ) . We also collected data on places visited and people present , allowing casual contact patterns to be estimated . Using these data , we estimated age mixing patterns relevant for i ) droplet and ii ) non - saturating airborne transmission . We also estimated a third category of pattern relevant for the transmission of iii ) Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) , an airborne infection where saturation of household contacts plays an important role in transmission dynamics . Results . Estimated contact patterns by age did not vary greatly between the three transmission routes / infections , in either setting . In both communities , relative to other adult age groups , overall contact intensities were lower in 50 + year olds when considering contact relevant for non - saturating airborne transmission or the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis than when considering contact relevant for droplet transmission . Conclusions . Our findings provide some reassurance that the widespread use of close contact data to parameterise age - mixing matrices for transmission models of airborne infections may not be resulting in major inaccuracies . The contribution of older age groups to transmission may be over - estimated , however . There is a need for future social contact surveys to collect data on casual contacts , to investigate whether our findings can be generalised to a wider range of settings , and to improve model predictions for infections with substantial airborne transmission .

Many models incorporate patterns of mixing between different sections of the population , most commonly between different age groups . Simulated mixing patterns can have a large effect on model dynamics ( 1 ) , and it is therefore important that realistic mixing patterns are simulated . Mixing patterns are frequently informed by social contact data : empirical data collected from respondents on the people that they had contact with over a set period of time ( 2 ) . The majority of social contact data collection has focused on ‘close’ contacts , with most studies using a definition of contacts that required a two way face - to - face conversation of at least three words , close proximity ( e . g . within 2m ) , and / or physical contact ( 2 ) . It is plausible that these types of contact approximate reasonably well the types of contact that are relevant for the transmission of infections that are transmitted primarily through direct contact and droplets . For obligate , preferential , or opportunistic airborne infections such as measles , Mtb , and SAR - CoV - 2 , however , it is likely that this definition excludes many potentially effective contacts . This is because transmission of airborne infections can occur between anybody ‘sharing air’ in inadequately ventilated indoor spaces , regardless of whether conversation occurs , and over distances of more than 2m ( 3 ) . For airborne infections , estimates of ‘casual contact’ time may therefore be more appropriate , calculated as the time spent in indoor locations multiplied by the number of other people present . Tuberculosis also differs from the majority of respiratory infections in the long durations of time for which people are potentially infectious – with an estimated 9 - 36 months between disease development and diagnosis / notification across 11 high burden countries ( 4 ) .

This effect is most pronounced for contact between household members ( 5 ) . Household membership and repeated contacts are rarely explicitly simulated in mathematical models , and therefore the effects of contact saturation need to be incorporated into the mixing matrices used to parameterise the models . In this paper , we describe methods for estimating age mixing patterns relevant for non - saturating airborne transmission and Mtb , using a novel weighted approach to incorporate the effects of household contact saturation into our estimates for Mtb . We generate estimates of age mixing using data on close and casual contacts from two communities in South Africa , and compare the estimated mixing patterns with those typically used in mathematical modelling studies – generated using close contact numbers , and more suitable for the droplet transmission . Methods Social contact data were collected in two study communities in South Africa : one in KwaZulu - Natal Province , and one in Western Cape Province . Both communities have high rates of unemployment , and high prevalences of HIV and incidences of tuberculosis compared to the provinces as a whole . The study community in KwaZulu - Natal consisted of a population of 46 , 000 , living in the predominantly rural and peri - urban areas in the catchment areas of two primary care clinics , and within a demographic surveillance area ( DSA ) . The study community in Cape Town was a peri - urban community of 27 , 000 people , and was an established research site with biennial censuses . .

Up to three attempts were made to contact sampled individuals . The Western Cape data were collected in May to October 2019 . In total , 1530 adults ( aged 15 + years ) were selected using age - and sex - stratified random sampling , based on a census conducted in the study population in February and March 2019 . Up to five attempts were made to contact selected individuals . Each attempt was made on different days of the week ( including at weekends ) , at different times of day to maximise the chance of making contact . For both surveys , interviews were conducted face - to - face at the respondents’ homes , using interview administered questionnaires on tablet computers . Interviews were conducted in isiZulu in KwaZulu Natal , and in English or isiXhosa in Western Cape . Respondents were asked about their movements on a randomly assigned day in the preceding week in KwaZulu - Natal , and on the day before the interview in Western Cape . To allow casual contact time ( defined as time spent ‘sharing air’ indoors or on transport ) to be estimated , respondents were asked to list the places they had visited ( including their own home ) and transport they had used . For each location , questions asked included : • What type of location was it ? • How long did you spend there ? • How many people were there , halfway through the time you were there ? Respondents were also asked about their close contacts , defined as people that the respondent had a face - to - face conversation with . Respondents were first asked to make a list of all their .

Respondents were then asked questions about a random 10 contacts , or all of their contacts if they reported fewer than 10 . Questions included : • Is this contact a member of your household ? • How old do you think they are ? • How much time did you spend with them in total ? Respondents’ basic demographic information were also collected . For the KwaZulu - Natal community , data on household size and residency ( urban , peri - urban , rural ) were obtained from the most recent DSA census . All other data were collected directly from the respondents . Ethics Ethical approval for the data collection in KwaZulu - Natal was granted by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee ( BREC ) of the University of KwaZulu - Natal ( BE662 / 17 ) and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Observational / Interventions Research Ethics Committee ( 14640 ) . Ethical approval for the data collection in Western Cape was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Cape Town ( HREC / REF : 008 / 2018 ) and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Observational / Interventions Research Ethics Committee ( 14520 ) . Informed consent was obtained from all participants . Data analysis Close contact numbers and times were estimated using data on people with whom the respondents reported having a face - to - face conversation . 95 % plausible intervals for the age mixing matrices were generated using bootstrapping .

Casual contact time in a location was estimated as the duration of time the respondent reported spending there , multiplied by the reported number of people present . Central estimates for casual contact time age - mixing matrices were generated using the method outlined in McCreesh et al ( 6 ) . In brief , as data were collected on numbers of total people and children present in indoor locations only , and not the ages of adults , the age distribution of adult casual contacts needed to be estimated . We therefore assumed that the age distribution of adult contacts in each location type matched the age distribution of respondents who reported visiting location of that time , weighted by the duration of time they reported spending in that location time , and weighted to the sampled population age and sex distribution . Household and non - household contact matrices were generated using data on contact time in respondents’ own homes and all other locations respectively . Plausible ranges were generated using bootstrapping . The age mixing matrices were adjusted to be symmetrical , using the study community age structures . Data on adult contact numbers and time with children were used to estimate child contact numbers and time with adults . To allow comparison between the two study communities , the lowest respondent age group was set at 15 - 19 years for both surveys . As 15 - 17 year olds were not interviewed in KwaZulu - Natal , we assumed that contact patterns in 18 - 19 years olds were representative of contact patterns in all 15 - 19 year olds .

Close contact time was used for household estimates as 1 ) it was considered plausible that the majority of contact between household members is likely to meet the definition of ‘close contact’ , and 2 ) it allowed the age structures of households to be more accurately reflected in the age - mixing matrices . Age - mixing matrices relevant for Mtb were set equal to the sum of the household close contact number matrices and the non - household casual contact time matrices , weighted to reflect empirical estimates of the proportion of tuberculosis that results from household transmission . For each pair of bootstrapped household and non - household matrices , a proportion of ‘contact’ that should occur in households was sampled from a uniform distribution between 8 - 16 % ( with 12 % used for the central estimate ) ( 5 ) . A weighted average was then generated , given the desired proportion of overall ‘contact’ by adults occurring in households . To allow direct comparisons to be made between the different age mixing matrices , the matrices for non - saturating airborne transmission and Mtb were adjusted to give the same mean contact intensity between adults as the matrices for droplet transmission . Further details of the analysis methods are given in the appendix . Results Recruitment Of the 3093 people sampled in KwaZulu - Natal , 1723 ( 56 % ) were successfully contacted , 299 ( 10 % ) were dead or reported to have out - migrated , and 1071 ( 35 % ) could not be contacted . Of those successfully contacted , 1704 ( 99 % ) completed an interview . Of the 1530 people sampled in Western Cape , 1214 ( 93 % ) were successfully contacted , 117 ( 8 % ) had moved or died , 193 ( 13 % ) had had incorrect information listed in the census , and 6 .

Of the 1214 people contacted , 77 ( 6 % ) refused to be interviewed and 14 were ineligible ( due to disability or lack of English and isiXhosa ) . Of 1123 people interviewed , technical issues meant that data from 8 interviews were lost , leaving 1115 ( 92 % ) completed interviews . Table 1 shows the characteristics of the respondents and the target population . For both populations , the recruited sample was a reasonable match to the target population in terms of sex , age , and residence type ( urban , peri - urban , or rural ) . Unemployment was high in both populations , with only 23 % of respondents in KwaZulu - Natal and 55 % in Western Cape reporting full - time , part - time , or casual employment . Household sizes were large in KwaZulu - Natal , with 48 % living in a household of eight or more , and smaller in Western Cape , with 79 % living in a household of four or fewer . Contact numbers and time Figure 2 and Appendix tables S1 - S6 show household and non - household close contact numbers and time and casual contact time in KwaZulu - Natal and Western Cape , by sex , age , and household size . Overall close contact numbers and time , and casual contact time , were significantly higher for women than for men in both communities , however the differences were generally not large . There was a tendency for casual contact time to decrease slightly with age in both communities , and close contact numbers and time were substantially higher in 15 - 19 year olds than in older age groups in Western Cape . Close contact numbers and time , and casual contact time , increased with increasing household size in both settings , driven by increases in contact with household members . Differences by household size were larger in Western Cape than in KwaZulu - Natal , most likely reflecting the fact that household sizes were self - reported in Western Cape , but obtained through linking to community census data in KwaZulu - Natal . Contact between household members made up a higher proportion of total contact in KwaZulu - Natal than in Western Cape , for all types of contact . .

Discussion The majority of data used to generate age - mixing matrices used in transmission models is close contact data – data on contacts involving a face - to - face conversation . For infections where airborne transmission is common , close contact data is likely to miss many potential effective contacts . Using data from two provinces in South Africa , we created improved estimates of age - mixing patterns for airborne infections , using a wider ‘casual contact’ definition that incorporated anybody ‘sharing space’ indoors . We also demonstrated a novel method for generating age - mixing matrices relevant for the transmission of Mtb , an airborne infection where long disease durations and the saturation of household contacts play an important role in transmission dynamics . Finally , we estimated age - mixing patterns from close contact data using the most commonly used method , which we have labelled as relevant for droplet transmission . In our settings , contact patterns did not vary greatly between contacts relevant for droplet infections and those relevant for non - saturating airborne transmission or Mtb . Using close contact data in models of the transmission of Mtb or other .

Very few data are available on casual contact patterns . Previous studies in the same community in Western Cape have found greater drops in casual contact time than in close contact numbers in older age groups ( 6 ) , and decreases in indoor casual contact numbers with age ( 7 ) . Another study in the same community found high levels of age - assortative mixing with respect to casual contact time in schools and workplaces ( 8 ) . More data are needed on casual contact patterns , and age - mixing patterns in particular , in order to determine whether the findings of this study are generalisable to other settings , and to improve the predictions from mathematical models of the transmission of Mtb and other airborne infections . Our approaches to generating the separate droplet and airborne transmission matrices are necessarily simplifications , and many infections will not fit neatly into these two categories . There is considerable uncertainty about the role of different transmission routes to the spread of many infections , and both airborne and droplet transmission are thought to play a role in the transmission of some respiratory infections , including SARS - CoV - 2 ( 9 ) . For these infections , an intermediate matrix may be preferable . There are two main differences between our droplet and airborne / Mtb age - mixing matrices . The first is the type of non - household contacts considered : close ( face - to - face conversation ) or casual ( sharing space indoors ) respectively . The second is that the airborne and ( non - household component of the ) Mtb matrices are based on contact time , rather than unique contact numbers . The primary reason for using contact time for casual contacts is that respondents are unlikely to be able to estimate unique casual contact numbers for many locations they visit , necessitating the use of contact time , or assumptions about the rate of turnover of unique people in a location . For our droplet transmission matrices , we chose to .

It should be noted , however , that both the choice of a 24 - hour time period , and the lack of any weighting or restrictions by contact duration or other measures of closeness , are relatively arbitrary choices . Robust evidence as to the types of contact most relevant to transmission are limited for respiratory infections . A number of studies have compared the fit to data on varicella , parvovirus B19 , or influenza A seroprevalence by age of models parametrised using contact patterns generated from close contact data in a range of different ways ( 10 - 12 ) . Overall , these studies suggest that analysis methods that give greater weight to more intimate contacts may be preferable in some circumstances . This could be achieved by restricting what counts as a contact to those involving physical touch and / or a minimum contact duration , or by using contact time rather than contact numbers . It has been suggested that approaches based on contact numbers may be more suitable for more highly transmissible infections , where only a short duration of contact is needed for transmission , whereas approaches based on contact time may be more suitable for less transmissible infections , where repeated or longer contacts are needed ( 13 ) . Fewer studies have considered expanding the pool of contacts beyond close contacts only , to also include casual contacts . One study however , that had paired individual - level contact data and pandemic influenza A serological data , found that models that included a variable for number of locations visited were strongly supported over those that only included variables for age and close contact numbers ( 14 ) . This suggests that airborne transmission may play a role in the spread of influenza A , and / or that the standard close contact definition misses a significant proportion of contacts at risk of droplet transmission . .

Ventilation rates play a large role in determining airborne infection risk ( 15 ) , and weighting by ventilation rates would improve our airborne and Mtb matrices . Unfortunately , few data on ventilation rates by location type are available , and they show large amounts of variation between locations , and between the same location on different days ( 16 ) . Saturation of contacts may occur for infections other than Mtb , particularly highly transmissible pathogens such as measles virus . An approach based on casual contact numbers may be preferable for these infections , but would be highly dependent on assumptions made about how unique contact numbers are related to estimates of cross - sectional numbers of people present . There are a number of limitations when using casual contact data to estimate mixing patterns . Firstly , estimates of contact time in places where large numbers of people are present are likely to be less reliable . This is because people’s estimates of the number of people present are likely to be poor , and because the assumption that there is a risk of transmission between all people present in the space may not be true in larger spaces . In our main analysis , when estimating contact time , we cap the number of people at risk of transmission at 100 . In our sensitivity analyses , we show that using a cap of 20 people , or not capping the numbers of people , has a moderate impact on casual contact time age mixing matrices ( see Appendix ) . Conducting similar sensitivity analyses may be necessary when using age mixing matrices calculated using casual contact time in mathematical models A second limitation is that the approach we use to determining the ages of adults present in locations other than respondents’ own homes is indirect , and relies on the assumption that the age distribution of adults present in a location type reflects the duration of time respondents of different ages reported spending in that location type . This may not always be a reasonable assumption , if different age groups tend to visit different locations of the same type ( or at .

These issues are discussed further in McCreesh et al 2019 ( 6 ) . An additional limitation of our estimates for KwaZulu - Natal only is that we did not recruit 15 - 17 years olds , and instead assumed in the analysis that contact by 18 - 19 year olds was representative of contact by all 15 - 19 year olds . This is unlikely to be true , with contacts by 15 - 17 and 18 - 19 year olds differing greatly in Western Cape ( see Appendix , Figure S7 ) . For this reason , our estimates for 15 - 19 year olds should be treated with caution for KwaZulu - Natal . To conclude , overall our estimated age - mixing matrices for droplet transmission , non - saturating airborne transmission , and Mtb were not substantially different from each other for either setting . This provides some reassurance that the widespread use of close contact data to parameterise age - mixing matrices for transmission models of airborne infections may not be resulting in major inaccuracies . Some differences were observed however , particularly in the oldest age group , and our data were from two South African settings only . We recommend that future social contact surveys should collect data on casual contacts as well as close contacts , to determine whether the similarity between different types of contact pattern is true across other settings . We would also urge mathematical modellers to consider whether unique close contact numbers in a 24 - hour period are the most appropriate contacts for the infection and scenario they are simulating , and to consider performing sensitivity analyses when there is uncertainty as to the most appropriate contact definition . .
