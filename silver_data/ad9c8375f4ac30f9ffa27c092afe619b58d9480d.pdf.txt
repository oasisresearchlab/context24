LecB resides in the outer membrane and can be released specifically by treatment of an outer membrane fraction with fucose suggesting that it binds to specific ligands . Here , we report that LecB binds to the outer membrane protein OprF . In an OprF - deficient P . aeruginosa mutant , LecB is no longer detectable in the membrane but instead in the culture supernatant indicating a specific interaction between LecB and OprF .

Introduction Lectins are proteins of non - immune origin that recognize and bind to specific carbohydrate structural epitopes . This group of carbohydrate - binding proteins function as central mediators of information transfer in biological systems and perform their duties by interacting with glycoproteins , glycolipids and oligosaccharides [ 1 ] . They are found in a wide range of organisms including viruses , bacteria , plants and animals , and are believed to play an important role in cell - cell interactions [ 2 ] . Bacteria possess several different types of lectins [ 3 ] , including for example FimH which is located at the top of type 1 pili from the uropathogenic Escherichia coli and recognizes terminally located D - mannose moieties on cell - bound glycoproteins mediating adhesion between the bacterium and the urothelium [ 4 , 5 ] . Furthermore , lectins may have a significant biotechnological and medical potential , as exemplified by the galactoside - specific mistletoe lectin , which is used on a large scale to support anti - cancer therapy [ 6 ] . P . aeruginosa , an opportunistic pathogen associated with chronic airway infections , synthesizes two lectins LecA and LecB ( formerly named PA - IL and PA - IIL ) [ 7 ] . Strains of P . aeruginosa that produces high levels of these virulence factors exhibit an increased virulence potential [ 8 ] . Both lectins play a prominent role in human infections , since it was demonstrated that P . aeruginosa - induced otitis externa diffusa [ 9 ] , as well as respiratory tract infections [ 10 ] including those in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients [ 11 ] , could be successfully treated by application of a solution contain - ing LecA and LecB - specific sugars . The sugar solutions pre - sumably prevented the lectin - mediated bacterial adhesion to the corresponding host cells . The expression of lectin genes in P . aeruginosa is coordinately regulated with certain other virulence factors and controlled via quorum sensing and by the alternative sigma factor RpoS [ 12 ] . LecB consists of four 11 . 73 kDa subunits , each exhibiting a high binding constant for L - fucose ( K D = 1 . 5 6 10 6 M 2 1 ) and its derivatives [ 13 , 14 ] and a somewhat lower binding constant for D - mannose ( K D = 3 . 1 6 10 2 M 2 1 ) . The crystal structure of LecB purified from E . coli showed a tetrameric organisation of the protein stabilized by Ca - ions with four sugar binding sites each composed of residues from two subunits [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] . Recently , we have demonstrated the N - glycosylation of LecB which appears to be required for proper transport to its final destination on the cell surface of P . aeruginosa [ 14 ] . In CF patients , increased terminal fucosylation of airway epithelial glycoproteins is found , as well as a higher percentage of sialylated and sulfated oligosaccharides in Lewis A oligosaccha - ride side chains , which presumably represent preferential ligands for LecB [ 16 ] thereby contributing significantly to chronic respiratory P . aeruginosa infections [ 18 ] . Interestingly , LecA and LecB also inhibit ciliary beating [ 19 ] which represents an important defence mechanism of the lung [ 20 , 21 ] . It was suggested that LecB is exposed on the surface of sessile P . aeruginosa cells , since the addition of L - fucose - branched chitosan led to specific cell aggregation [ 22 ] . In addition , it was shown that LecB is located in the bacterial outer membrane and a lecB - deficient P . aeruginosa strain is impaired in biofilm formation [ 23 ] . Addition of PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46857 glycopeptide dendrimers targeting LecB resulted in complete inhibition and dispersion of biofilms , which clearly marks this lectin as a valuable target for developing P . aeruginosa biofilm inhibitors [ 24 , 25 ] . LecB is also involved in the assembly of pili on the cell surface and in the production protease IV [ 26 ] . Cell surface appendages of P . aeruginosa , like pilus and flagella function as adhesins that bind to receptors , e . g . those present on the respiratory epithelium , thus initiating bacterial adherence [ 27 , 28 , 29 ] . The outer membrane protein OprF has been identified as an adhesin for human alveolar epithelial ( A549 ) cells [ 30 ] . OprF is a major outer membrane porin forming a non - specific , weakly cation - selective channel with two different channel sizes [ 31 , 32 , 33 ] . Interestingly , full length OprF is required for the formation of large pores whereas C - terminal truncations only form smaller sized pores [ 34 ] suggesting that OprF can adopt different conformations [ 35 ] . Furthermore , OprF plays an important role in antimicrobial drug resistance and has also been suggested as a vaccine component [ 36 ] . Gene disruption and gene deletion analyses have indicated that it is also required for cell growth in low - osmolarity medium , the maintenance of cell shape and peptidoglycan association [ 35 ] . In this paper we report that LecB is exposed on the surface of sessile P . aeruginosa cells where it interacts with the outer membrane porin OprF . Treatment of biofilm cells with L - fucose resulted in the release of LecB , whereas treatment with D - galactose had no effect . The interaction of LecB with OprF was directly demon - strated using N - terminal His - tagged LecB immobilized on Ni - NTA agarose and by affinity chromatography on a mannose agarose column , which resulted in co - purification of LecB and OprF . We furthermore observed that an OprF - deficient P . aeruginosa mutant secretes LecB into the culture medium indicating that this lectin binds to OprF on the bacterial cell surface .

An amount equivalent to a cell density of an O . D . 580 nm of 0 . 5 of each fraction was used for Western blotting . Outer Membrane Isolation Outer membranes were isolated by a modification of the method described previously [ 41 ] . P . aeruginosa PATI2 cells ( 500 mg dry weight ) were harvested after growth for 48 h at 37 u C by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min .

As a negative control , the same experiment was carried out with the lecB - deficient P . aeruginosa mutant PATI2 . One ml each of the eluates was analyzed by SDS - PAGE , 2 - D - gel electrophoresis and MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry . Isolation of LecB Ligands from the Outer Membrane The isolation procedure was carried out at 37 u C . The outer membrane fraction was incubated in 100 mM Tris - HCl contain - ing 2 mg His - tagged LecB for 1 h . After loading the sample onto a Ni - NTA - agarose column ( Quiagen , volume 5 ml ) ) , the column was washed with 50 ml Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing 50 mM imidazole and 300 mM NaCl to remove non - specifically bound proteins . LecB binding proteins were eluted with 5 ml 100 mM Tris - HCl containing 20 mM L - fucose . 1 ml of the sample was analyzed by 2 - D - gel electrophoresis and MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry . SDS - PAGE and 2 D Gel Electrophoresis Prior to SDS - PAGE , samples were suspended in SDS - PAGE sample buffer , boiled for 5 min at 99 u C and loaded onto an SDS - 16 % polyacrylamide gel . SDS - gel electrophoresis was run for 1 h at 200 V . For 2 D gel electrophoresis , the proteins were precipitated overnight with 20 % ( v / v ) TCA and afterwards washed twice with acetone . The protein preparation was air dried and resuspended in 1 ml rehydration buffer ( 7 M urea , 2 M thiourea , 4 % ( w / v ) 3 - [ ( 3 - cholamidopropyl ) dimethylammonio ] - 1 - propanesulfonate ( CHAPS ) , 2 % IPG buffer and pH 3 – 11 negative - logarithmic stripes as recommended by the manufacturer ( GE - Healthcare , Freiburg , Germany ) , 1 % ( v / v ) bromphenol blue ) .

The membranes were blocked with 3 % ( w / v ) BSA overnight at 4 u C . LecB , EstA and DsbA were detected by incubating the membranes with specific polyclonal antibodies [ 43 , 44 , 45 ] at a dilution of 1 : 20 , 000 , 1 : 85 , 000 and 1 : 100 , 000 in TBST ( 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 0 . 2 % v / v Tween 20 ) , respectively , followed by an anti - rabbit immunoglobulin G - horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( Bio - Rad ) . The blots were developed with the ECL chemiluminescence kit ( GE Healthcare ) . For detection of LecB ligands , the membranes were incubated either with 1 m g 6 ml 2 1 purified LecB protein in 10 mM TBS containing 3 % bovine serum albumin ( Fluka ) 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ( ROTH ) before exposure to the antibodies as described above or with 1 m g / ml peroxidase labelled LecB . The blots were developed with the ECL chemiluminescence kit ( GE Healthcare ) . Glucose - 6 - phosphate Dehydrogenase Assay Glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a cytoplasmic marker enzyme [ 8 , 46 ] . A stock solution of NADP ( 45 mM ) and a stock solution of glucose - 6 - phosphate ( 110 mM ) were diluted 1 : 100 in a buffer containing 55 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) and 11 mM MgCl . A 900 m l volume of this test solution was mixed with 100 m l of a sample from cytoplasm , periplasm , membrane fraction and supernatant , respectively , and the decrease in optical density ( OD340 / min ) was monitored spectrophotometrically at 30 u C for 90 sec . Protein Identification by MALDI - MS Spots of interest were excised from polyacrylamide gels and digested overnight with Trypsin Gold ( Promega , USA ) and eluted as described by Shevchenko et al . [ 47 ] . The diluted proteins were desalted if necessary with ZipTip C18 ( Millipore , USA ) and spotted on Prespotted AnchorChip ( Bruker , Germany ) with a HCCA ( a ´ - cyano - 4 - hydroxycinnamic acid ) matrix . The masses of the peptides were determined with an UltraflexIII system ( Bruker , Germany ) . Database search was carried out witch MASCOT ( [ 48 ] ; www . matrixscience . com ) . Hemagglutination Assay Rabbit red blood cells ( Fiebig Na¨hrstofftechnik , Germany ) ( RBC ) were collected , washed three times in PBS and resuspended to a final concentration of 5 % ( v / v ) . The erythrocyte suspension was diluted 9 : 1 with PBS buffer containing papain ( 1 % ( w / v ) and L - cysteine ( 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) ) and incubated for 1 h at 37 u C . Afterwards , the suspension was washed three times in PBS and 50 m l were mixed with 50 m l of PBS containing P . aeruginosa cells . P . aeruginosa was grown on NB Agar for 48 h by 37 u C . Bacterial cells were washed off with 1 ml 0 . 14 M NaCl and cells were isolated by centrifugation ( 10 min . ; 3000 6 g ) and the pellets washed three times with PBS and afterwards resuspended in 50 m l PBS . After incubation for 1 h at 37 u C , the erythrocytes were sedimented by centrifugation ( 30 sec at 1000 6 g at room temperature ) and the hemagglutination optically examined . Results LecB is Bound to the Surface of Biofilm Cells LecB can bind specific ligands located at the cell surface of P . aeruginosa [ 23 ] and biofilm formation can completely be inhibited by LecB specific fucosyl - peptide dendrimers [ 24 ] . These observa - tions prompted us to investigate the location of LecB on the surface of P . aeruginosa cells grown as a biofilm . To this end , P . aeruginosa PAO1 harbouring plasmid pBBC2 which contains the wild - type lecB gene under the transcriptional control of a consti - tutive lac promoter was grown as a biofilm on the surface of NB agar for 48 h . Growing bacteria on leaf and food surfaces , as colonies , that have a continuous air - biofilm interface has been shown to result in the formation of unsaturated biofilms [ 3 , 49 , 50 ] of the type that is also found in the lungs of CF patients suffering from P . aeruginosa infections . Under these growth conditions , LecB is located in the bacterial outer membrane [ 23 ] . Cells were incubated with 20 mM of the high affinity ligand L - fucose at 4 u C to release cell surface exposed LecB [ 14 ] . This low temperature was chosen to decrease the affinity of LecB for the ligands , since previous results had shown a minimal hemagglutination activity of LecB at 4 u C [ 43 ] . Cells and supernatant were separated by centrifugation and analysed by SDS - PAGE and subsequent Western - blotting using antiserum directed against LecB [ 23 ] and DsbA [ 51 ] , with the latter serving as a control to monitor whether cell lysis had occurred during fucose treatment . Fucose treatment led to the release of LecB , but not of DsbA into the supernatant , whereas cells treated with D - galactose did not release any LecB ( Fig . 1 ) . As expected , DsbA was detected only in the cell pellet fraction ( Fig . 1 ) . LecB Interacts with the Outer Membrane Porin OprF The finding that LecB could be released from the cell surface of P . aeruginosa encouraged us to search for putative LecB ligands . P . aeruginosa PAO1 was grown as an unsaturated biofilm on the surface of NB agar , the membrane fraction was isolated using differential cell fractionation and proteins were analysed by SDS - PAGE and subsequent Far - Western - blotting using purified LecB protein and a LecB - specific antiserum . Several immunoreactive bands could be identified in the membrane fraction representing putative LecB ligands ( Fig . 2A ) . Putative LecB ligands were purified by affinity chromatography on a mannose agarose matrix by utilizing the intrinsic specificity of LecB for D - mannose . In accordance with the purification protocol developed for LecB expressed in E . coli [ 15 , 37 ] , purification was carried out at 37 u C . P . aeruginosa PAO1 cells grown in NB medium for 48 h were disrupted by sonication and the cell lysate was loaded onto a D - mannose agarose column . After washing the column , bound proteins were eluted with 100 mM Tris - buffer containing 20 mM D - mannose and analysed by SDS - PAGE ( Fig . 2 B ) . As a negative control , the same experiment was performed using the lecB deficient mutant P . aeruginosa PATI2 . LecB itself and two additional proteins with an apparent molecular mass in the range of 35 kDa were detected , further separated by two - dimensional gel electrophoresis ( Fig . 2 C ) and the resulting spots were identified by MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry as the outer Figure 1 . Release of LecB from the cell surface of P . aeruginosa . Biofilm cells were incubated with 20 mM L - fucose for 1 h at 4 u C . Cell pellets ( P ) were separated from supernatants ( S ) by centrifugation and LecB was detected in both fractions by immunoblotting . Cells treated with 20 mM D - galactose served as a negative control . Additionally , blots were incubated with an antiserum against the periplasmic protein DsbA to monitor putative cell lysis during L - fucose treatment . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0046857 . g001 Lectin LecB Interacts with Porin OprF PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 4 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46857 membrane porin OprF ( PA1777 ) ( sequence coverage 48 % , mascot score 328 ) and the putative glutaminase - asparaginase PA1337 ( ansB ) ( sequence coverage 23 % , mascot score 116 ) . In contrast , cell lysates obtained from the lecB - negative strain P . aeruginosa PATI2 did not contain any proteins which could be isolated by affinity chromatography under these experimental conditions . Our findings clearly indicate that LecB interacts with the outer membrane porin OprF and the hypothetical protein PA1337 . The interaction between LecB and OprF was further investigated by growing the lecB - deficient mutant P . aeruginosa PATI2 in NB medium for 48 h , isolation of the outer membrane and incubation with purified N - terminal His - tagged LecB . The preparation was loaded onto a Ni - NTA - agarose column to immobilize putative lectin - ligand complexes . After washing the column , proteins were eluted by washing with Tris - HCl buffer containing 20 mM L - fucose and eluted proteins were analysed by 2 - DE ( data not shown ) . A single spot was detected and the respective protein was identified by MALDI - TOF mass spectrometry as OprF . Elution of OprF upon addition of fucose indicated that the interaction of LecB and OprF was specific and further suggested that OprF itself may be glycosylated . A specific interaction between OprF and LecB was confirmed by transferring the eluted OprF to a blotting membrane and subsequent treatment with peroxidase - labelled LecB . Again , binding of LecB to OprF could be demonstrated ( data not shown ) . LecB Binds OprF on the Cell Surface of P . aeruginosa Apparently , LecB is cell surface exposed and interacts with OprF via carbohydrate ligands . We further investigated this interaction by growing the oprF - deficient P . aeruginosa mutant H636 which harboured plasmid pBBC2 containing the lecB gene as an unsaturated biofilm on the surface of NB agar . After differential cell fractionation proteins were analysed by SDS - PAGE and Western - blotting , the wild - type strain P . aeruginosa PAO1 served as a negative control . Interestingly , LecB was detected in the cytoplasm and in the periplasm as well as in the culture supernatant of the oprF - deficient strain , whereas in the wild - type strain , LecB was detected only in the cytoplasm and in the membrane fraction ( Fig . 3 ) . The release of LecB into the culture supernatant and its absence from the outer membrane fraction in the OprF deficient mutant strongly suggests a specific interaction between LecB and OprF in the outer membrane of P . aeruginosa . OprF is Needed for Hemagglutination Activity of P . aeruginosa Lectins mediate the agglutination of erythrocytes caused by P . aeruginosa via interaction with specific sugar molecules on the surface of blood cells [ 52 ] . Our results described above suggested that the deletion of the oprF gene may affect the hemagglutination activity of the respective P . aeruginosa mutant . To test this assumption , erythrocyte cells were incubated for 1 h with P . aeruginosa PAO1 wild type , D l ecB and D oprF mutants and agglutination was optically examined ( Fig . 4 ) . As expected , P . aeruginosa wild - type cells showed strong hemagglutination activity , whereas mutant strains P . aeruginosa lecB as well as oprF caused a significantly decreased agglutination . Purified LecB served as a positive and PBS buffer as a negative control . The agglutination caused by LecB as well as by wild - type P . aeruginosa cells could be inhibited by the addition of 20 mM L - fucose to the sample buffer . These results indicated that an interaction of the porin OprF and Figure 2 . Identification of LecB interaction partners in P . aeruginosa . A .

The treatment of these chronic P . aeruginosa airway infections is difficult due to the innate and adaptive antibiotic resistance of P . aeruginosa and the formation of biofilms on the respiratory epithelium [ 44 , 53 ] . The lectin LecB and the major outer membrane porin OprF have both been shown to be involved in adhesion to lung epithelial cells [ 30 , 54 ] . Our study now demonstrates that LecB is bound to the bacterial outer membrane and interacts with OprF . In an earlier study , we already showed that LecB is localized in the bacterial outer membrane of P . aeruginosa biofilm cells [ 23 ] , but it remained unclear whether it faces the periplasm or the exterior . In this study , we washed biofilm cells with L - fucose which binds LecB with a high affinity ( K D = 1 . 5 6 10 6 M 2 1 ) [ 14 ] and we observed the release of LecB from the cell surface . Further analysis of membrane fractions by Far - Western - blotting using purified LecB detected several putative LecB ligands . These results already indicated that LecB specifically interacts with glycoproteins present in the bacterial membrane . The major outer membrane porin OprF was then co - purified from wild - type P . aeruginosa using affinity chromatography on mannose agarose indicating an in vivo interaction of both proteins . The same method applied to a lecB - deficient mutant of P . aeruginosa did not result in isolation of OprF . Moreover , OprF could be isolated from the outer membrane fraction by His - tagged LecB immobilized on Ni - NTA agarose and could also be detected by affinity binding to peroxidase labelled LecB . Apparently , co - purification of OprF depended on specific binding to LecB which could be abrogated by subsequent washing of the column with the LecB - specific sugar fucose . Efficient in vitro binding of peroxidase labelled LecB to OprF blotted onto PVDF membranes after SDS - PAGE clearly suggested that LecB recog - nized OprF . So far , we failed to obtain any experimental evidence for glycosylation of OprF . Hence , the mechanism of the interaction between LecB and OprF remains unknown and requires further investigation . Carbohydrate blood group antigens present on the surface of erythrocytes can bind to LecB and thereby cause hemagglutina - tion . We have observed that a P . aeruginosa lecB deficient strain showed a significantly decreased hemagglutination activity as compared to the corresponding wild - type strain ( Fig . 4 ) . In - terestingly , a P . aeruginosa oprF deletion mutant showed the same decrease in hemagglutination activity which could not be in - creased by expression of lecB from a plasmid . This result also strongly suggests an interaction of LecB with OprF on the cell surface of P . aeruginosa . Interactions of lectins with cell surface proteins of pathogenic bacteria have been reported before [ 55 ] . Lectins located at the tip of pili or agella including PapG and GafD of uropathogenic E . coli are referred to as adhesins , as they play a role in adherence to epithelial cells [ 56 ] . In an earlier report , we demonstrated that LecB is an important factor in the development of biofilms by P . aeruginosa [ 23 ] . Furthermore , it was suggested that both LecB and OprF contribute to bacterial adherence to A549 epithelial cells [ 30 , 54 ] . As P . aeruginosa is toxic to epithelial cells [ 57 ] , promotion of adherence might manifest as increased cytotoxicity and consequent lung epithelial destruction . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that LecB and OprF together may mediate adhesion of P . aeruginosa to receptors located on cells of either the same or of different species , thus enabling the colonization of host tissues as well as the formation of mono - or multispecies biofilms . Previously , it was reported that interferon gamma binds to OprF , resulting in the expression of another quorum - sensing dependent virulence determinant , the lectin LecA of P . aeruginosa . Interestingly , a fucosyl - residue is required for recognition of human interferon gamma by the receptor [ 58 ] suggesting that the fucose - specific LecB may act as an adaptor to mediate recognition of this cytokine by OprF on the bacterial surface . Thus , it would be interesting to test whether this regulatory effect on lecA expression through sensing of interferon gamma is still functional in a lecB - negative P . aeruginosa mutant .

The same amount of culture supernatant , periplasm , cytoplasm and total membrane were subjected to SDS - PAGE analysis followed by immunoblotting using LecB antiserum . Fractions obtained from P . aeruginosa wild - type ( wt ) served as a positive control . Fractionation controls : B . Cellular fractions were analyzed using antisera directed against EstA ( an outer membrane protein ) and DsbA - ( a periplasmic protein ) and C . by determination of relative glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( cytoplasmic protein ) activities . The per - centages of relative enzyme activities present in the cytoplasm ( CP ) , the periplasm ( PP ) , the membrane fraction ( MF ) and the culture superna - tant ( SN ) are shown . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0046857 . g003 Lectin LecB Interacts with Porin OprF PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 October 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 10 | e46857 In conclusion , our findings show that LecB and OprF are interaction partners in vivo but OprF is not involved in LecB secretion . Both proteins themselves have already been shown to influence key virulence - associated functions of P . aeruginosa [ 59 ] . Hence , the interaction of these proteins may modulate their individual functions and may even create novel functionalities affecting pathogenicity of P . aeruginosa .
