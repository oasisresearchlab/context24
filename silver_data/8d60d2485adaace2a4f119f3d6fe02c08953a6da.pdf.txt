Introduction Varioustechniquesintargeteddrugdeliveryhavebeendevelopedin recent years to reduce side effects , toxicity , and drug dosage ( Langer , 1998 ) . The use of particles as drug carrier helps in targeted delivery and release of drugs at disease region , serving the dual role of diagnosis and therapy ( Packhaeuser et al . , 2004 ; Singh and Lillard , 2009 ) . Nanopaticles ( NPs ) in the form of liposomes , dendrimers , micelles and polymers , as well as the more conventional and inorganic carbon , silica , iron and gold NPs are being widely used as drug carriers ( Cho et al . , 2008 ) . The uptake ef ﬁ cacy of NP based drug carriers is higher compared to their larger micron scale counterparts , which are easily cleared off by thehumanmononuclearphagocytesystem . NPsalsohavelargersurface tovolumeratio ( Lightetal . , 2010 ) , whichenhancestheirtargetingcapa - bilities . Thus , NP based drug delivery systems have a great potential to achieve ef ﬁ cient targeting of cells and molecules in in ﬂ ammation and cancer conditions ( Suri et al . , 2007 ) . In this section , challenges of drug delivery in microcirculation , in ﬂ uence of red blood cells , vessel geome - try effect and target selection will be discussed respectively . Current challenges in the study of drug delivery and distribution Recent theoretical modelling works demonstrated decreased parti - cle adhesion probability with increased ﬂ ow rate ( Liu et al . , 2012 ; Shah et al . , 2011 ; Tan et al . , 2013a ) . Due to bioethical regulations and complex physiological conditions , it is challenging to quantify the parti - cle delivery process in vivo . Mostof thecurrentstudiesare carried outin ﬂ owchambersorchannels ( HaunandHammer , 2008 ; Konaetal . , 2012 ) and these result are applicable to large blood vessels but not to micro - vasculature . Microvasculature refers to part of the circulatory system consisting of capillaries , arterioles , and venules . Microvasculature pa - rameters such as vascular geometry , target - receptor expression levels and ﬂ ow shear rate must be considered while performing in vitro tests . Study on speci ﬁ c receptor mediated binding of nano drug carriers under various physiologically relevant conditions help in understand - ing the methodologies to enhance targeted delivery ef ﬁ cacy and pro - vides a tool to determine the actual drug bioavailability . Distribution of drug carriers under the in ﬂ uence of RBC Bloodis acomplexbio - ﬂ uid consistingofRBCs , monocytes , platelets , proteins etc . Blood ﬂ ow in microvasculature is a two - phase ﬂ ow as the vessel diameter becomes comparable to the size of RBCs .

Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Microvascular Research journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / ymvre on RBC mediated particle delivery have to consider various in vivo microvasculature parameters , such as Fåhraeus – Lindqvist effect ( Fåhræus and Lindqvist , 1931 ) , Segre – Silberberg effect ( Segré and Silberberg , 1962 ; Yang et al . , 2005 ) , CFL formation ( Goldsmith , 1986 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ; McHedlishvili and Maeda , 2001 ) , vessel geometry / bifurcations ( Pries et al . , 1996 ) and blunt velocity pro ﬁ le ( Gaehtgens et al . , 1970 ; Reinke et al . , 1986 ; Rosenblum , 1972 ; Sugii et al . , 2002 ) . RBCs have a biconcave shape of ~ 8 μ m diameter and ~ 2 μ m thick - ness , and are highly deformable ( McHedlishvili and Maeda , 2001 ; Popel and Johnson , 2005 ) . The ﬂ exible RBCs migrate radially towards the centre region in microvessels based on various hemorheology factors such as shear rate , viscosity , hematocrit concentration , RBC ag - gregation and deformability . This result in a RBC concentrated core re - gion and a cell - free plasma layer near the vascular wall called CFL ( Goldsmith , 1986 ; Ji et al . , 2007 ; Popel and Johnson , 2005 ) . Particles ﬂ owing along with RBCs can diffuse towards these CFL and this will in - ﬂ uence their distribution and binding dynamics across a channel ( Aarts et al . , 1984 ; Goldsmith and Mason , 1962 ; Nanne et al . , 2010 ) . The deformable RBCs aggregate to form a fast moving core at the centre of the channel while the stiffer cells and particles marginate to the near wall CFL region of the microvessel . This localization of particles closer to the vessel wall would increase the particle density in the CFL region . The targeted binding of drug carriers to diseased cells would be enhanced by this process . In this work we consider the in ﬂ uence of RBCs on 210 nm and 2 μ m particle distribution . In ﬂ uence of vessel geometry in drug carrier distribution Human circulatory system consists of large blood vessels such as ar - teries and veins ( ~ 15 - 0 . 5 mm ) , and smaller vessels such as arterioles , venules ( 100 – 500 μ m ) and capillaries ( ~ 10 μ m ) . The distribution of drug particles in a real vascular network having hierarchical geometry will depend on local shear rate , ﬂ ow velocity , pressure and volume ( Mayrovitz et al . , 1977 ) . Our study considers the distribution of nano and micron sized particles in a branching channel that mimics the ge - ometry and ﬂ ow conditions of a dividing vascular network . A compari - son of particle binding density between the branching and the straight channel geometry is performed to examine non - uniform distribution of particles at vessel bifurcation with and without RBCs . In order to study the effect of a difference in ﬂ ow velocity distribution between daughter channels on particle binding , we conducted ﬂ ow tests on channel geometries that would produce asymmetric ﬂ ow rate distribu - tion in the two daughter channels . Speci ﬁ city in drug carrier targeting Speci ﬁ city in targeting is introduced by applying ligand - receptor chemistry in the micro ﬂ uidic platform . The biomimetic chip is coat - ed with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) protein , a cell - surface glycoprotein member of the Ig super - family . Under in ﬂ ammatory conditions , interaction between endothelial cells and blood constituents occur by the up - regulation of intercellular adhesion molecules such as ICAM - 1 on the surface of endothelial cells and leuko - cyte ( Gimbrone et al . , 1997 ; Zhai et al . , 1998 ) . This mediates the targeted migration of leukocytes into speci ﬁ c areas of in ﬂ ammation ( Min et al . , 2005 ) . Various ICAM - 1 based therapeutic agents for cancer immunotherapy and other modes of treatment are used nowadays ( Kanwar et al . , 2003 ; Tanaka et al . , 2002 ) . Here anti - ICAM - 1 coated 210 nm and 2 μ m particles are used as a model system to study the in - ﬂ uence of RBCs and vascular geometry on particle delivery . This work studies binding distribution of anti - ICAM - 1 coated parti - cles on ICAM - 1 protein coated micro ﬂ uidic platform . In ﬂ uence of particle size ( 210 nmand 2 μ m ) , shearrates , vessel geometries ( straight and branched channels ) and RBCs are examined . Micro ﬂ uidic device fabrication , protein coating ( on channels and particles ) and their characterization , and testing are described in methods section . Results and discussions under aforementioned conditions are given thereafter . Finally , the conclusion and future work are presented .

Single donor human whole blood and plasma was bought from Innovative Research Inc . Fabrication of micro ﬂ uidic device The required micro ﬂ uidic design is photo - lithographically patterned on a silicon wafer using SU - 8 2050 photoresist . Micro ﬂ uidic devices are fabricated using Sylgard 184 PDMS . PDMS base is mixed with its cure at 1 : 10 ( v / v ) ratio following the basic techniques in soft lithography ( McDonald and Whitesides , 2002 ) . The PDMS mixture is poured on the silicon wafer , which acts as the master template . The hard PDMS layer is peeled out after baking and the features are inspected . The micro ﬂ uidic device is made by binding the PDMS pattern on a clean glass slide after exposing them to oxygen ( O 2 ) plasma . The ﬂ ow chan - nels are 100 μ m wide and 100 μ m in height . Both straight and bifurcat - ing features are included in the design . The bifurcating channels have a branching angle of 60° . ICAM - 1 functionalized PDMS substrate PDMSdeviceswerecoatedwithICAM - 1aspreviouslyreported ( Haun and Hammer , 2008 ) . After binding with glass the PDMS micro ﬂ uidic de - vices were silanized with 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysilane to improve protein adsorption . After washing the device with an adsorption buffer ( 0 . 1 M NaHCO3 , pH 9 . 2 ) , the devices were incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature with saturating concentration of protein G in adsorp - tion buffer ( 100 μ g / ml ) . ICAM - 1 Fc chimera protein solution in PBS ( 100 nM ) was introduced after washing the substrates three times with PBS to remove any excess protein G . The devices were incubated with ICAM - 1 for 1 h at room temperature . The micro ﬂ uidic chips were purged with 1 % BSA containing 0 . 05 % Tween20 one hour prior to testing . Substrate ICAM - 1 density characterization InordertoquantifytheICAM - 1proteindensityonthePDMSsurface , ELISA was performed using an HRP - conjugated anti mouse IgG1 anti - body . ELISAreactionwascarriedoutina12 - wellplateandPDMScoated 22 mm circular glasses were used . The technique for substrate ICAM - 1 characterization was performed as reported in literature ( Haun and Hammer , 2008 ) . Silicone isolators ( Grace Bio Labs ) were used to assure that the same volume of reagents were applied on PDMS coated glass as in the micro ﬂ uidic device , to maintain the same surface area to volume ratio . 18 A . Thomas et al . / Microvascular Research 94 ( 2014 ) 17 – 27 Once the PDMS coated cover slips were coated with ICAM - 1 Fc protein , they were blocked before silicone isolators were removed . This was followed by incubation with mouse anti - ICAM - 1 at 2 μ g / ml for 1 hr at 4 °C , and incubation with HRP - conjugated mouse antibody ( 1 : 1000 di - lution ) . Each steps were followed by washing with ice cold PBS . After the ﬁ nalwashstep , thecoverslipswereplacedinthewellplate . Amplex Ultra Red reagent was used to initiate the ELISA reaction and was allowed to incubate for 10 min at room temperature . Fluorescence was measured on a microplate reader at 544 nm excitation / 590 nm emission . The readings were compared to a calibration curve and the ICAM - 1 surface density was calculated . Anti - ICAM - 1 coated micro / nano particles Neutravidincoated210nmandstreptavidincoated2 μ m ﬂ uorescent particles were diluted to 10 10 and 10 8 particles / ml respectively using Block - Aid and sonicated for 5 minutes . Biotinylated antibody ( anti - ICAM - 1 , control or both ) was added next after diluting the particles in 1 % BSA . The 210 nm particles were diluted to 10 9 particles / ml and the 2 μ m particles were brought down to 10 7 particles / ml and the antibody concentration was kept to a total of 10 μ g / ml . Particles were incubated for 3 hours while shaking at room temperature and the unbound anti - body was removed by centrifugation . The particles were washed in 1 % BSAsolution to remove anyleftover unboundantibodyand thendiluted to working concentration for the ﬂ ow tests . Particle concentration was analyzed on a microplate reader at 485 nm excitation / 530 nm emission and compared to a calibration curve constructed from stock particle solution . Particle anti - ICAM - 1 density characterization ELISA was performed using HRP conjugated anti - mouse k - light chain speci ﬁ c monoclonal antibody to characterize the particle surface antibody density . The speci ﬁ city of the reagent to mouse antibody light chain provides a direct measurement of the anti - ICAM - 1 binding sites available on the particle . Particles were incubated with 5 % HRP conjugated anti - mouse k - light chain speci ﬁ c monoclonal antibody for 30 minutes , followed by washing with 1 % BSA solution and clearing outof unbound antibody through centrifugation . 50 μ l of theparticle so - lution were loaded on a 96 - well plate and the particle concentration was analyzed . Then 50 μ l of Amplex Ultra Red reagent was added to each well and the HRP - substrate reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes at room temperature . The ﬂ uorescence intensity of the particle sample with Amplex Ultra Red reagent was observed on a microplate reader at 544 nm excitation and 590 nm emission . The ﬂ uorescence intensities were converted to the number of HRP mole - cule using the calibration curves prepared using biotinylated - HRP conjugation to the neutravidin / streptavidin coated particles . Assum - ing a 1 : 1 binding ratio between anti - ICAM - 1 and secondary anti - body , the anti - ICAM - 1 density on the particles were determined . In order to make sure the reaction mechanism and kinetics involved for anti - ICAM - 1 binding on particle and while performing ELISA are same in the nano and micron sized particles , we compared the ﬂ uo - rescence intensity for similar anti - ICAM - 1 density case of both parti - cle sizes . This helps to make sure that the different protein and antibody binding reactions involved while performing ELISA doesn ' t vary based on particle size and other possible steric hindrance factors . Micro ﬂ uidic ﬂ ow test cases The micro ﬂ uidic device is designed to mimic the geometry of a typ - ical microvasculature . The design contains both straight and branching sections . The bifurcating angle was decided from measurements on ar - terial microcirculation system , theoretical values based on Murray ' s law and the bifurcation angle relationships of minimum work principle ( Lee and Lee , 2010 ) . Particle binding density at straight and branching region are calculated separately . The area considered to be the bifurca - tion section starts from the point where straight channels begins to bi - furcate and ends in the daughter channel at a length of 2 . 5 times the vessel diameter from the apex of bifurcation ( Fig . 1 ) . This was based on the principle that it takes about 2 times the distance of vessel diam - eterforthereestablishmentofparabolic ﬂ owafterbifurcation ( Lewand Fung , 1970 ) . Anti - ICAM - 1 coated particles were ﬂ own through ICAM - 1 modi ﬁ ed micro ﬂ uidic devices at different shear rates between 200 and 1600 s − 1 . This corresponds to physiologically relevant values observed in the microvessels ( Nagaoka and Yoshida , 2006 ; Nigro et al . , 2011 ) . The bind - ing session was followed by a PBS only ﬂ ushing session to remove un - bound particles and to study particle detachment . This is performed at the same shear rate used to study particle attachment . The shear rate of ﬂ ow in daughter channels are half that of the parent channel after branching , as they have the same dimension as the parent channel and also the daughter channels are of the same length . The particle con - centration is kept at 10 8 / ml and 10 6 / ml for 210 nm and 2 μ m particles respectively . The duration of ﬂ ow were ﬁ xed at 15 and 20 minutes for 210 nm and 2 μ m particles respectively . These time periods and particle concentrations were decided to accommodate all particle binding stud - iestoawindowwherethebindingratewassteadyandthebindingden - sity could be practically quanti ﬁ ed . Since the particle concentration and ﬂ ow time are kept constant for all shear rates , the numbers of total par - ticles introduced into the channels increase with shear rate . This factor is considered while calculating the particle binding density . The results were normalized to a total particle count of 10 6 / ﬂ ow case for all studies performed . The normalization process is explained in the supplementa - ry information ( Table S7 ) . Tocompare theeffectofparticle sizeon bind - ing , few ﬂ ow cases were performed at 10 6 / ml concentration for 210 nm particles . Particle binding density was computed from confocal scans of the bottom surface of the channel . Time lapse imaging was performed in order to determine the attachment and detachment pro ﬁ le of the parti - cles under different ﬂ ow conditions . Analysis of particle binding was performed on a high resolution laser confocal ﬂ uorescence microscope ( FV1000 - IX81 , Olympus ) . The particle binding density is computed at the centre section of the bottom channel surface . Centre section of the channel is decided by excluding areas within 25 % of the channel width from edges . Flow conditions are more stable at the centre com - paredtotheedgesofthe channelandthus thevariationin particlebind - ing density is low here . Flow tests were performed with particles diluted in pure buffer and whole blood with 25 % RBC hematocrit , which represents the average hematocrit in microvessels ( Pries et al . , 1995 ) . Whole blood with 40 % RBC concentration was brought down to 25 % by diluting in human blood plasma . The RBC ﬂ ow case studies the in ﬂ uence of RBCs on parti - cle diffusion and binding in microvessels . Blood plasma can contain sol - uble factors like CAM molecules which vary from donor to donor and can possibly affect the binding of particles on ICAM - 1 modi ﬁ ed sub - strates ( Blankenberg et al . , 2001 ; Gearing and Newman , 1993 ) . Thus the same pool of plasma and whole blood was used for all RBC ﬂ ow test cases and the tests were performed the same day to normalize the effect of these soluble factors . Fluid ﬂ ow was generated using a programmable syringe pump ( Harvard Apparatus ) , which controls the volumetric ﬂ ow rate that is proportional to the wall shear rate . The wall shear rate ˙ γ was derived from the volumetric ﬂ ow rate Q using the following relation : ˙ γ ¼ 6Q = H 2 W (cid:1) (cid:3) 1 þ H = W ð Þ f (cid:2) H = W ð Þ Where H is the height and W is the width of the micro ﬂ uidic device . ' f ' is a geometry factor derived from the ratio of width to height . In this 19 A . Thomas et al . / Microvascular Research 94 ( 2014 ) 17 – 27 study , a micro ﬂ uidic channel with a height and width of 100 μ m is used , thus f = 0 . 5928 ( Son , 2007 ) . The effect of asymmetric ﬂ ow between daughter branches on parti - clebindingwasalsostudied . Fordaughterchannelswithidenticalwidth and height , the relationship between ﬂ ow rate and resistance is simpli - ﬁ ed to L a Q a = L b Q b ( Chau et al . , 2009 ) ( L a , Q a , L b and Q b are the length and ﬂ ow rate of the daughter channels a and b respectively ) . Based on this , a change in length in one of the daughter channel would propor - tionally change the ﬂ ow rate in that channel . A change in ﬂ ow rate would translate to a direct proportional change in shear rate of ﬂ ow ( Table 1 on page 25 ) . Channels were designed to generate different ﬂ ow distribution in the two daughter channels as shown in Table 1 . The shear rate in one of the daughter channel is half of the other . Only straight sections of both the parent and daughter channels ( after branching ) were scanned to quantify the particle binding density in this case . Particle binding was quanti ﬁ ed at the same distance from branching apex for both the daughter channels . Results and discussion Characterization of particle receptor and PDMS substrate ligand protein densities ICAM - 1 coating density of the micro ﬂ uidic channels were kept the same for all ﬂ ow cases . It was determined by applying ELISA on PDMS coated glass slides as described before ( Haun and Hammer , 2008 ) . ICAM - 1 density on our micro ﬂ uidic channels was measured to be 121 ± 12 sites / μ m 2 . NeutrAvidin coated 210 nm and Streptavidin coated 2 μ m particles were functionalized with anti - ICAM - 1 based on biotin - avidin chemistry . The anti - ICAM - 1 coating density on the particle was determined using ELISA . Complete saturation of antibody coating on 210 nm particles produced 239 . 3 ± 25 anti - ICAM - 1 / particle . This was brought down to 157 . 9 ± 19 and 78 . 6 ± 9 anti - ICAM - 1 / particle . This corresponds to 1905 . 3 ± 199 / μ m 2 for the maximum antibody density case , followed by 1257 . 1 ± 151 and 625 . 8 ± 71 anti - ICAM - 1 / μ m 2 . The 2 μ m parti - cles were tuned to have a density of 12184 . 1 ± 264 and 2767 . 9 ± 103 anti - ICAM - 1 / particle which corresponds to 1199 . 2 ± 25 and 272 . 2 ± 10 anti - ICAM - 1 / μ m 2 respectively . Particle coating density was tuned using biotinylated goat IgG control antibody . Speci ﬁ city of anti - ICAM - 1 coated particle binding to ICAM - 1 coated surface Speci ﬁ city of particle binding to ICAM - 1 coated surface was studied by comparing the binding of anti - ICAM - 1 coated particles to negative control case ( Fig . 2 ) . Particles coated with biotinylated goat IgG control antibody was used as negative control . 210 nm and 2 μ m sized particles were coated with 1905 . 3 and 1199 . 2 anti - ICAM - 1 / μ m 2 respectively .

Thomas et al . / Microvascular Research 94 ( 2014 ) 17 – 27 Both pure buffer and RBC 25 % cases were performed at a shear rate of 200 s − 1 . Particles speci ﬁ cally bound to ICAM - 1 coated micro ﬂ uidic channel with around ten times higher density when compared to the negative control case , for both pure buffer and with RBCs cases . 210 nm particle binding distribution In order to study the binding and ﬂ ow dynamics of particles in the nanometer scale , studies were performed on 210 nm particles suspended in both pure buffer and whole blood ( 25 % RBC ) . Binding of particles on both straightand bifurcatingregions of thechannel was ex - amined . Three different anti - ICAM - 1 particle coating densities ( 1905 . 3 , 1257 . 1 and 625 . 8 anti - ICAM - 1 / μ m 2 ) were studied and ﬂ ow tests were conducted for a shear rate range of 200 – 1600 s − 1 . It is observed that the binding density of 210 nm particles decreases with shear rate in both straight and branching channels for pure buffer case ( Figs . 3A and C ) . However , for the RBC 25 % ﬂ ow case ( Figs . 3B and D ) an increase in binding density is observed for the 1257 . 1 and 625 . 8 anti - ICAM - 1 / μ m 2 cases till 550 s − 1 shear rate .

Thomas et al . / Microvascular Research 94 ( 2014 ) 17 – 27 density occurs at a shear rate of 200 s − 1 . The particle binding density databeforenormalization ( Fig . S1 ) showsanincreaseinparticlebinding density till 550 s − 1 for all the three particle anti - ICAM - 1 coating densi - ties . This anomaly before and after normalization for the 1905 . 3 anti - ICAM - 1 / μ m 2 particle case could be because of the particle binding den - sity reaching a saturation , i . e . all the ICAM - 1 receptor spots available for binding on the wall is occupied by anti - ICAM - 1coated particles and there are nomore accessible ICAM - 1 receptors on the channel . To verify thisweextendedthe ﬂ owtime ( to45 minutes ) forthe200s − 1 caseand observed the particle binding density reaching a saturation at around the same value seen for 550 s − 1 case before normalization ( Fig . S1 C ) . Fig . 4 shows confocal images of particle binding in the branching section of the channel for different anti - ICAM - 1 coating densities at 550 s − 1 shear rate for 210 nm particles under RBC 25 % ﬂ ow case . The RBC 25 % ﬂ ow case show ~ 2 – 3 times enhanced binding density when compared to pure buffer ﬂ ow case for 210 nm particles , with the differ - ence decaying with increase in shear rate ( Fig . 3 ) . This increa s e in parti - cle bindingdensitycan be explained by the availability ofmore particles to the near wall region when ﬂ owing with RBCs . The presence of RBCs pushoutparticles fromthechannelcentretowardsthenearwallCFLre - gion , thereby bringing more particles closer to the ICAM - 1 coated sur - face . In order to con ﬁ rm this phenomenon , the concentration of free suspending 210 nm particles in the CFL region was compared between thepure buffer and RBC25 % ﬂ ow cases . Confocal images of particle ﬂ ow at 200 , 550 and 900 s − 1 shear rates were collected . Images captured from 1 μ m above the bottom surface of the channel to a height of 5 μ m in the z direction were summed together . This compilation shows the ﬂ uorescence intensity emitted by the particle ﬂ ow present in the CFL region . Analysis of the stacked confocal ﬂ uorescence images ( Fig . S3 ) showed an increase in ﬂ uorescence intensity for the RBC 25 % ﬂ ow case compared to the pure buffer case for all three shear rates . This con ﬁ rms higher particle concentration , thus the localization of free suspending 210 nm particles in the near wall CFL region when ﬂ owing with RBCs . As the shear rate increases from 550 s − 1 to the higher shear regime , particle binding density drops for the RBC case like the pure buffer case . This is likely because the localization of parti - cles to the CFL saturates or drag force produced by ﬂ ow shear exceeds adhesion force between ICAM - 1 and anti - ICAM - 1 receptor ligands . The decrease in particle binding density with an increase in shear rate can be explained as the binding process being in a reaction limited regime as explained in the work of Charoenphol et al . ( 2010 ) and Namdee et al . ( 2013 ) . A similar drop in particle binding density for 210 nm particles with increase in shear rate is also observed in Haun and Hammer ' s work ( Haun and Hammer , 2008 ) . The binding density also increases with particle anti - ICAM - 1 density for all ﬂ ow cases . Higher antibody coating density on the 210 nm parti - cles provides a better possibility of enough ligand - receptor bondforma - tion to assure ﬁ rm attachment of the particles to the ICAM - 1 coated surface ( Haun and Hammer , 2008 ; Tan et al . , 2013b ) . In terms of channelgeometry , 10 % higherNPbindingdensityisobservedatbifurca - tions compared to straight channels . Flow disturbances or alteration of ﬂ ow at bifurcation regions lead to enhanced particle collision with the wall , which enhance binding ( Lamberti et al . , 2013 ; Prabhakarpandian et al . , 2011 ; Tan et al . , 2013a ; Zhang et al . , 2005 ) . 2 μ m particle binding distribution To study micron sized particle distribution , binding of 2 μ m particles were studied in pure buffer and whole blood case at 25 % RBC . Particle bindingdensitywasevaluatedforbothstraightandbranchingchannels . Flow tests were performed using particles of 1199 . 2 and 272 . 2 anti - ICAM - 1 / μ m 2 coating densities . Like the 210 nm particles the binding density of 2 μ m particles also decreases with shear rate in both straight and branching section of the channel for pure buffer case ( Figs . 5A and C ) . They show around 6 – 10 times increase in binding density when suspended in 25 % RBC depend - ingon theshearrate ( Figs . 5B and D ) when compared to the pure buffer case . The shear rate range under study leads to formation of CFL during RBC ﬂ ow . The accumulation of RBCs in the centre core region of the channel pushes the 2 μ m particles toward the near wall CFL . This in - creases theconcentration of 2 μ m particles nearthechannelsurface . Ac - cumulation of particles in the CFL leads to overall increase in particle binding observed for the 2 μ m particles . However , as the ﬂ ow shear rate increases above 550 s − 1 the particle binding density decreases for the 2 μ m particles . At higher shear rates the larger drag force can easily wash away larger attached particles regardless of anti - ICAM - 1 coating density . Work by Patil et al . found the shear rate required to set in mo - tion a ﬁ rmly adhered microsphere to decrease with increasing micro - sphere diameter ( Shinde Patil et al . , 2001 ) . This is a result of same shear producing higher drag force on larger particles . Thus shear rate based detachment effects are more dominant in the larger 2 μ m parti - cles compared to the 210 nm ones . This is consistent with existing liter - ature ( Decuzzi et al . , 2007 ; Goldman et al . , 1967 ; Shinde Patil et al . , 2001 ) . Detachment pro ﬁ le of 210 nm and 2 μ m particles in Figs . S4 and S5 gives a better understanding of this phenomenon . Similar to the 210 nm particles the binding density of 2 μ m particles also increase with particle anti - ICAM - 1 coating density . At 200 s − 1 shear rate there is about ﬁ ve time increase in particle binding density for the 1199 . 2 / μ m 2 case over the 272 . 2 / μ m 2 anti - ICAM - 1 density case ( Figs . 5B and D ) . However such antibody coating density induced in - crease in binding density decays at higher shear rates for the 2 μ m par - ticles . It is observed that at 1600 s − 1 shear rate both particle anti - ICAM - 1 coating densities show similar binding density . At lower shear rates the particle binding is in ﬂ uenced more by the receptor - ligand interac - tion . However at higher shear rates the 2 μ m particle binding process is in ﬂ uenced more by the availability of particles near the wall region and the detachment of particles by the high ﬂ ow shear rate . Like the 210 nm particles ~ 10 % increase in binding density is also observed for B C A Fig . 4 .

Fig . 6 shows confocal images of particle binding in the branching section of the channel for different anti - ICAM - 1 coating densities at 200 s − 1 shear rate for RBC 25 % ﬂ ow case . The binding pro ﬁ les of 210 nm and 2 μ m particles at different shear rates demonstrate that there are two mechanisms involved in particle attachment . Generally , the particle attachment process consists of particle diffusion / margination toward the wall and ligand - receptor bond formation upon contact . The increase in shear rate decreases the timeavailableforparticletodiffuse / marginatetoward thewall , thusde - creasing the binding density . The time available for ligand - receptor re - action also play a role in particle attachment ( Calderon et al . , 2009 ; Goldsmith and Mason , 1967 ) .

At lower shear rates particles have longer time period for multivalent bond formation , while it decreases when the ﬂ ow happens at high shear rates . This ex - plains the decreased particle binding density observed with an increase in shear rate . Higher antibody coating density helps faster formation of enough ligand - receptor bonds to assure ﬁ rm attachment , thus increase binding density . On the other hand , the particle detachment process is the competi - tion between drag force and bonding force from ligand - receptor pairs . At low to medium shear rates , higher ligand coating density helps par - ticle from being detached . However , very large drag force dominates at high shear rate , especially for 2 μ m particle . A very rough estimate of the drag force on a sphere is : F D ¼ π 8 ρ C D d 2 , where C D is the drag co - ef ﬁ cient andd is theparticle diameter . Thedragforceacting ona sphere increases linearly with the area of the sphere . Meanwhile , the ligand - receptor bonding force does not increase linearly with area of the sphere due tothepointcontact nature of the sphere - surface interaction . Thus2 μ mparticlescanbeeasilywashedawayathighshearrates , asex - plained by thelow bindingdensity aswell ashigher detachment rate . In comparison , the 210 nm particles experience much smaller drag force even at high shear rate . Comparison between binding of 210 nm particle and 2 μ m particles A comparison is performed on the binding density characteristics of 210 nm and 2 μ m particles with similar anti - ICAM - 1 densities ( 1257 . 1 and 1199 . 2anti - ICAM - 1 / μ m 2 for 210nmparticles and 2 μ m particles re - spectively ) in this section . Figs . 7A and B compares the particle binding density for 210 nm and 2 μ m particles for pure buffer and RBC 25 % ﬂ ow case respectively . For the RBC ﬂ ow case 2 μ m particles show higher binding for shear rates up to 550 s − 1 . This is constant with work by Namdee et al . ( 2013 ) who also observes increased binding for 2 μ m particles compared to 200 nm when ﬂ owing in a 30 % RBC solution . For higher shear rates thelargerdragforceactingonbigger2 μ mparticles leads todetachment and thus produce less particle binding compared to 210 nm particles . For the pure buffer case the binding density of 210 nm particles is 2 - 3 timeshigher than2 μ m particles . However , it should benotedthat this study was conducted at a particle concentration of 10 8 / ml for the 210 nm particles and 10 6 / ml for the 2 μ m particles . In order to under - stand the effect of this 100 times increase in particle concentration on binding density , we also did ﬂ ow tests at 10 6 / ml particle concentration for 210 nm particles . It was observed that both the pure buffer and RBC 25 % ﬂ ow cases produced particle binding that didn ' t vary signi ﬁ cantly with changes in factors such as shear rate , particle antibody density or ﬂ ow with RBCs ( data not shown ) . To understand this we measured the localization of 210 nm particles at this concentration near the wall region for the pure buffer and RBC 25 % case using confocal microscope scanning . No signi ﬁ cant ﬂ uorescence signal was observed near the wallregionwhencomparedtothe10 8 / mlcase ( Fig . S3 ) , whichindicates the lack of particle localization to near wall CFL region . Our study was conducted at a particle concentration of 10 8 / ml for the 210 nm particles and10 6 / mlforthe2 μ mparticlesandtheresultswerenormalizedto10 6 particles / ﬂ ow case for both particle sizes . Thus this 100 times higher 210 nmparticle concentration should have translated to the higher par - ticle binding density observed in the pure buffer case . The work by Namdee et al . ( 2013 ) also observes an increase in particle binding den - sity with increased particle concentration for the pure buffer case . Fig . 7C compares the magnitude of increase in particle binding den - sity for RBC 25 % whole blood case compared to the pure buffer case for the 2 μ m and 210 nm particles with similar anti - ICAM - 1 density .

Thomas et al . / Microvascular Research 94 ( 2014 ) 17 – 27 the RBC 25 % case over the pure buffer case under the same shear rates for both 2 μ m and 210 nm particles . 2 μ m particles show almost three times increase in binding ratio when ﬂ owing with RBCs compared to similar 210 nm particle case for shear rate up to 550 s − 1 . Even at high shearrates above 550 s − 1 2 μ m particles show almost twice the binding ratio compared to 210 nm particles , although detachment becomes dominant as shear rate increases . Prominentbindingis observed forthe2 μ mparticle for RBC 25 % ﬂ ow case when compared to 210 nm particles due to size based enhanced particle margination to the CFL . Particles or cells marginate toward the near wall cell free region when ﬂ owing along with RBCs ( Abbitt and Nash , 2003 ; Charoenphol et al . , 2010 ; Gentile et al . , 2008 ; Tan et al . , 2012 ) . This occurs because of their interaction with RBCs and the defor - mation of the RBCs in ﬂ ow . The collision between the deforming RBCs during ﬂ ow easily pushes out particles or cells of size comparable to RBCs to the cell free plasma region . In the work of Eckstein et al . ( 1988 ) , a size selective enhanced exclusion of beads of diameter greater than 2 . 2 μ m was observed . In this con ﬁ ned region the interaction be - tween the RBCs and particles increases the collision between the anti - ICAM - 1 coated particles and the ICAM - 1 coated PDMS surface and this leads to increased particle binding . Similar phenomenon was observed in other works ( Charoenphol et al . , 2010 ; Melder et al . , 1995 ; Namdee et al . , 2013 ) . Comparatively only a smaller percentage of 210 nm parti - cles marginate toward the near wall region and most of them tend to ﬂ ow along with RBCs in the core region because of their smaller size ( Eckstein et al . , 1988 ) . This along with their smaller size compared to the CFL ( 2 - 10 μ m ) ( Kim et al . , 2009 ; Maeda et al . , 1996 ) produces less increase in particle binding density compared to the 2 μ m particle case . Daughter channels with asymmetric ﬂ ow velocity In micro circulation , daughter channels can have difference in ﬂ ow velocities between them after branching ( Pries et al . , 1996 ) . In order to study the effect of this asymmetric ﬂ ow distribution between daugh - ter branches on particle binding , we conducted tests in channels of ge - ometries that produce this effect . The parent and daughter channels were of the same cross sectional area , but of different lengths . This would produce a variation in ﬂ ow rate between the daughter channels such that the shear rate of one daughter channel would be half of the other . Daughter channel ‘ b ’ had half the length of channel ‘ a ’ ( Figure along with Table 1 ) for this purpose . Table 1 lists the shear rates of ﬂ ow in parent and the two daughter channels for the three ﬂ ow cases performed . Flow tests were conducted for 210 nm and 2 μ m particles having an anti - ICAM - 1 coating density of 1905 . 3 / μ m 2 and 1199 . 2 / μ m 2 , suspended in 25 % hematocrit whole blood . Thebindingdensityfor210nmparticlesataconcentrationof10 8 / ml is givenin Fig . 8A . Forthethree ﬂ ow casesat a shearrate of 200 , 900and 1600 s − 1 in the parent channel , higher particle binding density is ob - served in the daughter channel when compared to the parent channel . Daughter channel ‘ a ’ have 1 / 3rd and ‘ b ’ have 2 / 3rd the shear rate of the parent channel and between them channel ‘ b ’ has twice the shear rate ofchannel ‘ a ’ . Thedaughter channel ‘ a ’ shows almost 2times higher binding density than channel ‘ b ’ . This can be explained by channel ‘ a ’ having half the ﬂ ow shear rate of channel ‘ b ’ . 210 nm particles show similar increased binding density with decreased shear rate pattern as discussed earlier ( Fig . 3 ) . Forthe2 μ mparticlesalmostsimilarparticlebindingdensitywasob - served in parent and daughter channels for all shearrates other than for 1600 , 1066 . 6 and 900 s − 1 ( Fig . 8B ) after normalization . These results match well with what we saw for RBC 25 % case of 2 μ m particles at dif - ferent shear rates for a particle anti - ICAM - 1 density of 1199 . 2 / μ m 2 ( Fig . 5 ) . It is observed that the particle binding density begins to de - crease dramatically for shear rate above 600 s − 1 . This is because of large drag force from these higher shear rates acting on the particle , which leads to decreased receptor ligand reaction and also increased particle detachment . In ﬂ ow channels where the daughter branches have different ﬂ ow velocities , there might be a preferential , non - linear distribution of RBCs / particles to the daughter branch with the faster ﬂ ow ( Fenton et al . , 1985 ; Fung , 1973 ; Yen and Fung , 1978 ) . Thus the daughter channel with higher ﬂ ow velocity / shear rate ends up receiving more RBCs / particles . We didn ' t observe such a preferential ﬂ ow of particles to the daughter channel having the higher shear rate . This could be because our particle size is much smaller when compared to the ﬂ ow channel cross section . Our 2 μ m particle is only 0 . 02 times the size of the channel with a length and height of 100 μ m each ( 210 nm particle becomes more insigni ﬁ cant ) . The above mentioned non - lineardistribu - tion are prominent only when the diameter of RBC / particle is of the same range as the channel diameter ( Yen and Fung , 1978 ) . Conclusion The binding density of anti - ICAM - 1 coated 210 nm and 2 μ m parti - cles on ICAM - 1 modi ﬁ ed PDMS micro ﬂ uidic devices is characterized in this work . The study employs various factors that in ﬂ uence particle distribution and binding such as ﬂ ow shear rate , particle size , ﬂ ow along with RBCs , vessel geometry , antibody coating density on the par - ticle , particle concentration and effect of asymmetric ﬂ ow distribution between daughter channels . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 B i nd i ng den s i t y ( # / mm 2 ) parent channel daughter channel a daughter channel b 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 x 10 4 B i nd i ng den s i t y ( # / mm 2 ) parent channel daughter channel a daughter channel b A B Flow case 1 Flow case 2 Flow case 3 Flow case 1 Flow case 2 Flow case 3 Fig . 8 .

Thomas et al . / Microvascular Research 94 ( 2014 ) 17 – 27 The particle binding densities for both 210 nm and 2 μ m particles decrease with increased shear rate for pure buffer case . This can be ex - plainedbythe decreased available timefor particle to diffuse / marginate toward the wall under increased ﬂ ow rate . RBCs play an important role in particle binding and distribution pattern . Both 210 nm and 2 μ m par - ticles show enhanced binding density at 25 % hematocrit RBC ﬂ ow . 210 nm particles showed 2 – 3 fold increase in binding under blood ﬂ ow till a shear rate of 550 s − 1 and 2 times increase in binding for much higher shear rates when compared to the pure buffer case . Simi - larly , 2 μ m particles show around 6 - 10 fold increase in binding for shear rates up to 550 s − 1 and around 4 times increase in binding for much higher shear rates when compared to the pure buffer case . The steep drop in binding density observed for the RBC 25 % ﬂ ow case of 2 μ m particles beyond a shear rate of 550 s − 1 is a result of high shear ﬂ ow inducedlargedragforceactingon thebigger2 μ m particles leading to their detachment . The smaller 210 nm particles have much lower drag force acting on them compared to the 2 μ m particles . In terms of vessel geometry , both particles show slight increase in bindingdensityatthe bifurcation region compared tothe straightchan - nels . ThisisobservedforbothpurebufferandRBC25 % ﬂ owcase . Distur - bance of ﬂ ow at bifurcation region leads to enhanced particle collision withthewallandresultsinhigherparticlebindingdensity . Thiscontrib - utes to the enhanced binding observed at branching section . Higher an - tibody coating density helps faster formation of enough ligand - receptor bonds to assure ﬁ rm attachment of particles . Higher particle anti - ICAM - 1 coating density thus increases binding density , except for high shear rate cases for 2 μ m particles where shear based detachment drag force nulli ﬁ es the enhancement brought by increased antibody density . Theresultsproducedinourstudycanberelatedtoclinicallyrelevant drug delivery systems like liposomes ( Allen and Cullis , 2013 ) , trimethyl chitosan ( TMC ) ( Mourya and Inamdar , 2009 ) and Poly ( lactic - co - glycolic acid ) ( PLGA ) based particles ( Danhier et al . , 2012 ) . Our model system is spherical in shape and made of polymerized polystyrene , sim - ilar to structures generated through conventional techniques of particle fabrication like emulsion , precipitation and polymerization of formula - tions . The application of ligand based targeting is currently largely employed in such platforms to attain speci ﬁ c attachment and receptor mediated endocytosis to diseased cells . The ligand functionalization provides better therapeutic performance especially for macromolecules that are hard to enter cells on their own ( Danhier et al . , 2012 ; Lammers et al . , 2012 ; Mourya and Inamdar , 2009 ) . Such targeted platforms also expresses better uptake by cells based on vascular permeability ( Rakesh and Triantafyllos , 2010 ) , tumor penetrability ( Rakesh and Triantafyllos , 2010 ) and ligand - receptor density and af ﬁ nity ( Orcutt et al . , 2012 ; Park et al . , 2002 ) . The particle sizes in our study roughly cover the size range of established delivery platforms ( Danhier et al . , 2012 ; Mourya and Inamdar , 2009 ; Torchilin , 2006 ) . Our work helps to determine the transport properties of drug car - riers in the microvasculature . From this work we conclude that 2 μ m particles have betterbindingef ﬁ ciency based onnumber countand par - ticle volume , for low to medium shear rate ﬂ ow regions . For disease conditionswhereahigherparticleconcentrationordosageisacceptable ( drug toxicity not an issue ) and higher shear ﬂ ows are involved , the smaller particles in the200 nmscale would bemore suitable . Properties like the enhanced particle margination and binding to the wall at high particle ﬂ ow concentration observed in this work favours the use of NPs . Other advantages like the ability to be better retained in tissues via the enhanced permeability and retention effect , longer circulation period and better targeting ability are also in favour of NPs . When designing targeted vascular drug carriers , various parameters have tobe considered likethe disease condition , permissible drugtoxic - ity based particle concentration , reticuloendothelial system evading properties etc . This work is part of a project to develop customized bio - mimeticmicro ﬂ uidicexperimentalplatformthatmimicsspeci ﬁ cmicro - vasculature conditions based on disease state and physiological conditions . These goals are to be achieved by coating the micro ﬂ uidic channels with endothelial cells to mimic vascular morphology and to mimic disease condition by introducing speci ﬁ c cytokines . Thus a more physiologically relevant test condition can be set up for studying nano / micro drug carrier distribution and binding .
