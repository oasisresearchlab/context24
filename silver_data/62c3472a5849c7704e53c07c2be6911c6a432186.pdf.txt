Westbrook * † Vollum Institute , Oregon Health and Science University , Portland , OR , United States Dendritic spines , the distinctive postsynaptic feature of central nervous system ( CNS ) excitatory synapses , have been studied extensively as electrical and chemical compartments , as well as scaffolds for receptor cycling and positioning of signaling molecules . The dynamics of the shape , number , and molecular composition of spines , and how they are regulated by neural activity , are critically important in synaptic efﬁcacy , synaptic plasticity , and ultimately learning and memory . Dendritic spines originate as outward protrusions of the cell membrane , but this aspect of spine formation and stabilization has not been a major focus of investigation compared to studies of membrane protrusions in non - neuronal cells . We review here one family of proteins involved in membrane curvature at synapses , the BAR ( Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ) domain proteins . The subfamily of inverse BAR ( I - BAR ) proteins sense and introduce outward membrane curvature , and serve as bridges between the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton . We focus on three I - BAR domain proteins that are expressed in the central nervous system : Mtss2 , MIM , and IRSp53 that promote negative , concave curvature based on their ability to self - associate . Recent studies suggest that each has distinct functions in synapse formation and synaptic plasticity . The action of I - BARs is also shaped by crosstalk with other signaling components , forming signaling platforms that can function in a circuit - dependent manner . We discuss another potentially important feature—the ability of some BAR domain proteins to impact the function of other family members by heterooligomerization . Understanding the spatiotemporal resolution of synaptic I - BAR protein expression and their interactions should provide insights into the interplay between activity - dependent neural plasticity and network rewiring in the CNS . Keywords : BAR domain protein , post - synaptic , synaptic plasticity , dendritic spines , membrane curvature , ﬁlopodia INTRODUCTION Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain proteins have recently taken center stage as specialized effector proteins coordinating actin cytoskeleton and membrane remodeling and facilitating cell - signaling events . Membrane remodeling and cell shape reorganization in response to signals from neighboring cells or the environment are essential functions of all cells including neurons . In neurons , such modulation of membrane topology is necessary for axonal and dendritic morphogenesis , generation of presynaptic sites of neurotransmitter release , and the initiation and maintenance of the protrusions known as dendritic spines at central excitatory synapses . BAR domains form anti - parallel dimers , each consisting of three bent anti - parallel alpha helices as well as two protruding arms ( Peter et al . , 2004 ) . BAR - domain - containing proteins can be divided Frontiers in Neural Circuits | www . frontiersin . org 1 December 2021 | Volume 15 | Article 787436 Chatzi and Westbrook Post - synaptic I - BAR Proteins into three categories based on their differential membrane curvature : BAR / N - BAR , F - BAR , and I - BAR . BAR / N - BAR and F - BAR proteins have been well described in synaptic vesicle endocytosis , recycling , and structural organization of synapses ( Simunovic et al . , 2019 ) The CNS role of the third category , the I - BAR protein subfamily , the focus of this review , has been much less explored . BAR / N - BAR domain dimers have a crescent shape and promote inward convex membrane curvatures . The prototype of this category is amphiphysin , which is highly expressed in mammalian neurons and critical to endocytosis of synaptic vesicles at presynaptic nerve terminals ( Qualmann et al . , 2011 ; Kessels and Qualmann , 2015 ) . A second large category contains an F - BAR ( Fes / CIP4 homology BAR ) domain . The atomic structure of F - BAR domains show a less curved , more elongated shape compared to classical BAR domains , with five alpha helices followed by a short sequence for homodimerization ( Henne et al . , 2007 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . Most F - BAR proteins are involved in endocytic and vesicle trafficking events in neuronal morphogenesis and migration ( Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Dharmalingam et al . , 2009 ; Hartig et al . , 2009 ; Feng et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , I - BAR and inverse F - BAR ( iF - BAR ) protein subfamilies promote concave curvatures , as found in slit - Robo GTPase - activating proteins ( srGAP 1 - 4 ) , which localize along negatively curved membranes and regulate the development and maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses ( Saarikangas et al . , 2008 , 2015 ; Carlson et al . , 2011 ; Endris et al . , 2011 ; Charrier et al . , 2012 ; Coutinho - Budd et al . , 2012 ; Waltereit et al . , 2012 ; Bacon et al . , 2013 ; Fossati et al . , 2016 ; Chatzi et al . , 2019 ) . We discuss here recent findings regarding the role of I - BAR proteins in synaptic formation and in structural and functional plasticity . Accumulating evidence indicates that I - BAR proteins are involved in excitatory synapse formation and post - synaptic plasticity including the induction , shaping , and morphological remodeling of dendritic spines and anchoring and trafficking of post - synaptic receptors ( Hori et al . , 2005 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ; Sawallisch et al . , 2009 ; Burette et al . , 2014 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; Dosemeci et al . , 2017 ; Sistig et al . , 2017 ; Kawabata Galbraith et al . , 2018 ; Chatzi et al . , 2019 ; Minkeviciene et al . , 2019 ) . I - BAR - containing proteins have actin - binding domains that synergize with actin to form filopodia and dendritic spines ( Hori et al . , 2005 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ; Sawallisch et al . , 2009 ; Burette et al . , 2014 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; Dosemeci et al . , 2017 ; Sistig et al . , 2017 ; Kawabata Galbraith et al . , 2018 ; Chatzi et al . , 2019 ; Minkeviciene et al . , 2019 ) . The morphological changes associated with the organization and dynamics of the synaptic actin cytoskeleton regulate activity - dependent synaptic plasticity including the formation of new synapses as well as remodeling of existing connections . This plasticity represents a key mechanism for rewiring neural circuits during development , learning and memory , and in brain disorders ( Stuchlik , 2014 ; Khanal and Hotulainen , 2021 ) . The Generation of Membrane Protrusions by I - BAR Domains The I - BAR domain was initially identified as a homologous domain in the N - terminus of two mammalian proteins , Insulin Receptor Substrate of 53 kDa ( IRSp53 ) and Missing in Metastasis ( MIM ) , and thus labeled as an IM domain ( IRSp53 / MIM ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . Because of structural similarity to classical BAR domains , the IM domain was subsequently renamed as the I - BAR ( Inverse - BAR ) domain ( Scita et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , three of the five mammalian I - BAR proteins are expressed in the CNS : IRSp53 , MIM ( or Mtss1 , Metastasis suppressor 1 ) , and ABBA / Mtss2 ( actin - bundling protein with BAIAP2 homology , previously Mtss1L ) . We will refer to these three proteins as IRSp53 , MIM , and Mtss2 , respectively . As for the other two mammalian I - BARs , brain expression of IRTKS’ ( insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate ; also known as BAIAP2L1 ) is low whereas little is known about BAIAP2L2 ( FLJ22582 ; Millard et al . , 2007 ) . Unlike the substantial structural variability among members of the BAR / N - BAR and F - BAR subfamilies , I - BAR subfamily members are closely related . They share the N - terminal I - BAR domain , which binds to membranes and promotes self - association resulting in head - to - head dimers with their C - terminal protruding at each end . The I - BARs contain other protein - protein interaction domains that can contribute to specific signaling complexes in different cellular environments ( Figure 1A ) . For example , IRSp53 has an SH3 domain , which binds to proline - rich sequences in regulators of actin dynamics , such as WAVE - 2 , Mena , Eps8 , PSD - 95 , and Shank ; a CRIB ( Cdc42 - and Rac - interactive binding ) domain in its C - terminal interacts with the small GTPase Cdc42 ; as well as a PDZ binding domain ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Funato et al . , 2004 ; Soltau et al . , 2004 ; Abou - Kheir et al . , 2008 ) . MIM and Mtss2 can associate with each other , incorporating an actin monomer - binding WH2 ( WASP - homology 2 ) domain at the C - terminus , which suggests they function at the interface between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . Despite their closely related I - BAR domain , MIM and Mtss2 differ in several other domains ( Figure 1A ) . For example , Mtss2 has a serine - rich domain that suggests a role of phosphorylation and a leucine zipper domain that could affect dimerization ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . These sorts of regulatory effects and interactions between family members have yet to be fully explored . Structurally , the I - BAR domains assume a zeppelin - like structure with two alpha helical anti - parallel dimers ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ; Bassereau et al . , 2018 ; Figure 1B ) . The I - BAR domain induces plasma membrane protrusions by binding the inner leaflet of phosphoinositide - rich membranes through a lipid - binding surface , resulting in tubular structures with convex geometry and thus inducing negative membrane curvature ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . MIM and Mtss2 have N - terminal amphipathic helices , which result in tubules with diameters ( ∼ 70 nm ) , which are larger than those made by IRSp53 ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ) . Whether this difference is important in dendritic spine size is not clear . I - BAR domains induce strong PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 clustering upon membrane binding , modulating their lipid organization ( Saarikangas et al . , 2009 ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . MIM initiates the formation of spine proto - protrusions in a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - dependent manner in vitro . PIPs serve as good candidates to recruit spine - initiating factors Frontiers in Neural Circuits | www . frontiersin . org 2 December 2021 | Volume 15 | Article 787436 Chatzi and Westbrook Post - synaptic I - BAR Proteins FIGURE 1 | ( A ) Schematic of domain structures of mammalian I - BAR domain proteins .

In vitro MIM - GFP localizes to dendrites with higher expression in spine heads and filopodia ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . In general , I - BAR oligomerization increases membrane binding , which might correspond with lipid microdomains . Such an organization may act as structural platforms for the recruitment of other proteins and the formation of local signaling centers . Whether this is cause or result is not yet known . Expression Patterns and Localization of I - BAR Proteins in the Postnatal Brain Given the tubulating activity of I - BAR domains and their helical assembly , the expression patterns of each I - BAR family member in the brain and their subcellular localization is critical to understanding their function in dendritic spines and synaptic function . Of the three I - BAR proteins expressed in the CNS , IRSp53 , the founding member of the subfamily , has been the most extensively studied . IRSp53 mRNA is abundantly expressed in brain regions rich in spiny neurons including the hippocampus , cerebellum , striatum , and cortex ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ; Bockmann et al . , 2002 ; Burette et al . , 2014 ) . The protein distribution of IRSp53 , assessed by X - gal staining in brain slices from IRSp53 + / − reporter mouse brains and by immunohistochemistry of endogenous IRSp53 in rat brains , follows a similar pattern ( Bockmann et al . , 2002 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ; Sawallisch et al . , 2009 ; Burette et al . , 2014 ) . Expression reaches a maximum during the first 3 weeks postnatal , a period of active synaptogenesis ( Bockmann et al . , 2002 ; Choi et al . , 2005 ) . In the adult mouse hippocampus , IRSp53 immunoreactivity is present in the dentate gyrus and CA1 as well as in CA2 and CA3 ( Burette et al . , 2014 ) . Immunolabeling is present in the soma and apical dendrites of dentate granule cells and in pyramidal neurons ( Burette et al . , 2014 ) . The punctate immunolabeling throughout the neuropil in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus , and the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens in CA1 are consistent with synaptic localization on dendritic - spine bearing neurons ( Burette et al . , 2014 ) . Somata and proximal dendrites of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum , one of the most ‘‘spiny’’ neurons in the brain , also exhibit immunopositive puncta in the molecular and granule cell layers ( Burette et al . , 2014 ) . IRSp53 staining is prominent in GABAergic medium spiny neurons in the striatum whereas it is lacking in aspiny GABAergic interneurons in the neocortex and hippocampus ( Burette et al . , 2014 ) . Although IRSp53 expression seems to be limited to spiny neurons regardless of their neurotransmitter phenotype ; more studies are necessary to verify if that is the case for other members of the I - BAR family . IRSp53 was the first I - BAR protein to be identified in the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) , the protein complex lining the postsynaptic membrane . The PSD comprises a 30 – 40 nm thick electron - dense core layer and a deeper , contiguous pallium layer at excitatory synapses ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ; Dosemeci et al . , 2016 ) . Biochemical fractionation and Western blotting also support the postsynaptic localization of IRSp53 . Ultrastructural studies have confirmed the localization of IRSp53 at the PSD as well as in other dendritic spine sub - compartments away from the PSD including tangential walls and the cytosol ( Choi et al . , 2005 ) . In cultured hippocampal cells , depolarization ( by NMDA receptor stimulation or increased extracellular potassium ) promotes synaptic translocation of IRSp53 , which is dependent on PKC - dependent phosphorylation of the I - BAR domain and the PDZ - binding domain ( Hori et al . , 2005 ) . This observation suggests that the localization of IRSp53 can be regulated by neuronal activity ( Hori et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , IRSp53 within the PSD differs between brain regions . For example , in excitatory neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus , IRSp53 is concentrated at the center of the PSD , whereas in spiny inhibitory neurons of the neostriatum and cerebellar cortex it is distributed more uniformly ( Burette et al . , 2014 ) . As dendritic spines can differ in ultrastructure , protein composition , and signaling pathways ( Harris and Weinberg , 2012 ; O’Rourke et al . , 2012 ) , the specific localization of I - BAR proteins within the dendritic spine may provide clues to molecular organization and function . For MIM , in situ hybridization , western blotting , and immunohistochemical analyses show neuronal - specific expression in the adult hippocampus and the cerebellum ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; Sistig et al . , 2017 ) . In the hippocampus , MIM immunoreactivity is localized in soma and dendrites of pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA3 and dentate granule cells . MIM expression is highest in Purkinje cells where it reaches a maximum at P8 ( Holst et al . , 2008 ; Sistig et al . , 2017 ) . At this early postnatal stage , its expression is restricted to the soma whereas by adulthood it is expressed throughout the dendrites ( Kawabata Galbraith et al . , 2018 ; Minkeviciene et al . , 2019 ) . Cerebellar Frontiers in Neural Circuits | www . frontiersin . org 3 December 2021 | Volume 15 | Article 787436 Chatzi and Westbrook Post - synaptic I - BAR Proteins granule cells also express MIM early in development , but expression decreases after P15 ( Holst et al . , 2008 ) . MIM is absent in axons of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons supporting a largely postsynaptic location in dendrites ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . MIM expression has been reported across different ages in the mouse cortex , hippocampus , and the cerebellum with the highest expression in Purkinje cells across the lifespan , but in some reports expression in cortex and hippocampus was only detected in early development ( P7 ; Minkeviciene et al . , 2019 ) . Mtss2 ( formerly known as Mtss1L or ABBA ) has been the least studied I - BAR protein in the CNS . Initially , Mtss2 was detected in radial glial cells during development and implicated in glial membrane protrusions and end - feet ( Saarikangas et al . , 2008 ) . However , recent evidence indicates neuronal expression of Mtss2 that is activity - dependent in mature granule cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in adult mice ( Chatzi et al . , 2019 ) . Thus , neuronal expression of Mtss2 may have been underappreciated because of its unrecognized activity - dependent expression . For example , in mouse adult dentate granule cells , Mtss2 mRNA is upregulated in granule cells activated by a single bout of voluntary exercise . In Mtss2 KOMP reporter mice ( Chatzi et al . , 2019 ) in which the endogenous Mtss2 promoter drives bacterial beta - galactosidase ( lacZ ) LacZ expression was undetectable at baseline , then peaked at 3 days post - exercise parallel with mRNA expression ( Saarikangas et al . , 2008 ) . In the cerebellum , Purkinje cells with their high basal firing rates are the only neurons that express Mtss2 at baseline in adult mouse brain ( Chatzi , unpublished data ) . Endogenous Mtss2 immunoreactivity in cultured hippocampal neurons could be detected only after exposure to brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , which is upregulated by exercise and involved in activity - dependent synaptic plasticity ( Chatzi et al . , 2019 ) . In vitro Mtss2 also colocalizes with the somatodendritic marker MAP2 along dendrites and in dendritic spines . As Mtss2 had not been previously recognized as activity - dependent , it will be important to investigate its expression at different ages and in other cell types such as radial glial and interneurons . Examining how activity - dependent induction of I - BAR signaling cascades in different cells types impact synaptic and circuit function will be important for understanding plasticity and remodeling of synapses . The expression patterns of IRSp53 , MIM , and Mtss2 overlap in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons in the cerebellum and the hippocampus , but how that relates to synaptic function is not yet clear . A remaining challenge to understanding their functional significance will be to distinguish their cytosolic pools , which might represent protein in transit ( unbound vs . interacting with other cytoskeletal elements ) from the membrane - associated pool in and around dendritic spines . It is possible that the cytosolic pool in the dendritic shaft represents a reserve pool that can translocate to spines and initiate spine formation by binding to membranes , thus acting as an early effector of synapse formation . I - BAR signaling cascades elicited by synaptic stimulation could be synapse - specific , thus representing biochemical signaling compartments that confine structural plasticity to individual spines and circuits . Compartmentalization of I - BAR proteins could facilitate synapse - specific plasticity and thereby regulate the strength of synaptic connections . To date , it has not been possible to directly assess these issues because the limited resolution of live - cell light microscopy has not allowed a direct correlation of subcellular localization and dynamics of I - BAR proteins to be established . Emerging technologies in fluorescence microscopy that enable imaging at resolutions below the diffraction limit in combination with tagging of I - BAR proteins in vitro and in vivo may now make it possible to determine how spine initiation and plasticity affects localization and diffusion of cytoplasmic or membrane - associated I - BAR proteins . I - BAR Proteins in Dendritic Spine Development and Synaptic Plasticity Dendritic spines serve as the hubs for the organization of excitatory synapses . These membrane protrusions coordinate dynamic interactions between membrane shaping proteins , scaffolding molecules , receptors , signaling molecules , and , importantly , the actin cytoskeleton ( Tonnesen and Nagerl , 2016 ) . Actin remodeling is an essential component of spine development and plasticity ( Hotulainen and Hoogenraad , 2010 ) . Both MIM and Mtss2 contain the actin monomer binding WH2 - domain that could facilitate actin polymerization ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . However , the WH2 domain of MIM was not needed for filopodia formation or the increase in spine density with MIM overexpression ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . Initiation of dendritic spines by direct membrane bending by the MIM I - BAR domain in vitro critically required actin filament assembly by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is activated by nucleation - promoting factors WASP and WAVE that are in turn activated by phosphoinositides , Rho GTPases , and BAR - domain proteins ( Soderling , 2009 ) . Thus I - BAR - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 clustering could recruit Arp2 / 3 complex activators WASP and WAVE to spine initiation sites . Interestingly the nucleation - promoting factor WASP co - localized with MIM at spine initiation sites to form filopodia in vitro . Recent results suggest that WAVE1 induces sheet - type actin polymerization , whereas N - WASP creates more focal point polymerization ( Pipathsouk et al . , 2021 ) . Differential interactions of I - BAR domains with WASP may facilitate actin polymerization in dendritic filopodia whereas interactions with WASP might be needed for more organized actin structures such as spine heads . Interestingly in cerebellar Purkinje cells , MIM can also bind to the formin DAAM1 and inhibit the actin polymerization ( Kawabata Galbraith et al . , 2018 ) . Formin family proteins form straight actin filaments instead of branched actin filament networks ( Firat - Karalar and Welch , 2011 ) , both of which can exist in synaptic structures . Thus I - BAR proteins may have multiple functions in local actin regulation during dendritic spine formation . The shape of dendritic spines governs , at least in part , their function , ranging from filopodia - like protrusions , some of which are spine precursors , to more mature stubby , thin , or mushroom - shaped structures ( Li and Sheng , 2003 ; Runge et al . , 2020 ) . Filopodial facilitate the interaction of presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes during synaptogenesis . Filopodia are dynamic and change shape within a very short Frontiers in Neural Circuits | www . frontiersin . org 4 December 2021 | Volume 15 | Article 787436 Chatzi and Westbrook Post - synaptic I - BAR Proteins time scale ( min ) ( Li and Sheng , 2003 ; Alimohamadi et al . , 2021 ) . Activity - dependent morphological changes also occur in mature spines associated with synaptic plasticity ( Li and Sheng , 2003 ; Alimohamadi et al . , 2021 ) . The architecture and activity - dependent plasticity of dendritic spines and their postsynaptic densities ( PSDs ) enable the tuning of synaptic strength . Given the properties of I - BAR proteins , they are well - positioned to modulate synaptic actin cytoskeleton and membrane substructures during dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity ( Figure 2 ) . Consistent with this idea , gain - and loss - of function phenotypic analyses of the IRSp53 and MIM have revealed potential roles in synapse formation ( Choi et al . , 2005 ; Kim et al . , 2009 ; Sawallisch et al . , 2009 ; Burette et al . , 2014 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; Sistig et al . , 2017 ; Chatzi et al . , 2019 ; Minkeviciene et al . , 2019 ) . IRSp53 expression can affect the number as well as the functional properties of excitatory synapses ( Kang et al . , 2016 ) . For example , downregulation of IRSp53 in cultured hippocampal neurons decreased the density , but not size , of dendritic spines whereas overexpression increased spine density and size ( Choi et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , excitatory synapse formation is delayed in IRSp53 - / - hippocampal neurons in vitro ( Kim et al . , 2009 ; Sawallisch et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , these knockout mice did not show alterations in excitatory synapse formation in the hippocampus in vivo ( Kim et al . , 2009 ; Sawallisch et al . , 2009 ) , but were reported to increase NMDA receptor - mediated synaptic responses and enhance long - term potentiation as well as hippocampal - dependent learning deficits . These authors hypothesized that IRSp53 deletion leads to an abnormal stabilization of synaptic actin filaments , which may promote synaptic localization of NMDARs under basal conditions and suppress their activity - dependent relocation ( Chung et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , in the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) , IRSp53 - / - mice show a decrease in frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs and synapse numbers by EM without affecting NMDA receptor function ( Chung et al . , 2015 ) . Deletion of IRSp53 in glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic mPFC neurons lead to distinct behavioral deficits and synaptic changes between male and female mice ( Kim et al . , 2020 ) . Whether these differences reflect alterations at the synaptic or circuit level or reflect compensation by other I - BAR proteins is not yet clear . However , it seems plausible that I - BAR proteins may act not only as initiators of membrane protrusions but also as adaptors in signaling complexes . Synaptic phenotypes are also apparent in MIM knockout mice ( MIM KO ) . Cerebellar Purkinje cells show the most striking phenotype with a reduced number of spines and abnormal dendritic morphology ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; Sistig et al . , 2017 ) . These abnormalities correlate with deficits in motor coordination and altered electrophysiological properties in Purkinje cells . Interestingly , in the hippocampus the total spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons of adult MIM KO mice was unaffected , however , there was a slight reduction in thin and stubby spines ( Minkeviciene et al . , 2019 ) . Despite the modest changes in spine density , MIM KO mice exhibit hippocampal - dependent spatial learning defects and decreased anxiety - like behavior in the water maze and open field tests similar to IRSp53 KO mice . It is possible that compensation by IRSp53 in the absence of MIM is sufficient for synapse formation in the hippocampus , but proper brain function nevertheless requires the integrative presence of both proteins in the post - synaptic compartment . Similar to MIM , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 - dependent membrane localization is necessary for iF - BAR protein SrGAP3 to induce filopodia - like protrusions in vitro ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ) . Whereas both SrGAP3 and MIM proteins support the initiation of thin spines , the former also inhibits the transition of thin spines to mushroom spines ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . Similarly , the iF - BAR domain of srGAP2 promotes filopodial formation in cortical neurons ( Coutinho - Budd et al . , 2012 ) . Global knockout of SrGAP3 decreases the number of dendritic filopodia during early mouse development ( Carlson et al . , 2011 ) , whereas loss - of - function of srGAP2 results in increased spine density with delayed spine maturation ( Charrier et al . , 2012 ) . The role of Mtss2 in spine density and synaptic function has been largely unexplored . Our recent work identified activity - FIGURE 2 | Hypothetical role of I - BAR proteins on activity - dependent spine initiation , elongation and maturation . The formation of the dendritic spine begins with the initiation of ﬁlopodia . Activity - dependent recruitment of I - BAR proteins stimulates actin cytoskeleton growth resulting in further elongation of the ﬁlopodia . Further increase of I - BAR membrane density induces branching of the actin ﬁlaments due to Arp 2 / 3 complex activity , creates the spine head , and enhances spine plasticity . Frontiers in Neural Circuits | www . frontiersin . org 5 December 2021 | Volume 15 | Article 787436 Chatzi and Westbrook Post - synaptic I - BAR Proteins dependent expression of Mtss2 as a novel effector of synaptic rearrangement . Overexpression of Mtss2 in hippocampal neurons increased dendritic spine density in vitro and in vivo , consistent with a role of its I - BAR domain in membrane curvature and dendritic spine formation ( Chatzi et al . , 2019 ) . A single episode of voluntary exercise increased neural activity in a subset of dentate granule cells . The activated cells showed a laminar - specific increase in excitatory EPSCs and dendritic spines in the outer molecular layer that receives input from the lateral entorhinal cortex , whereas inputs on the same dendrites from the medial entorhinal cortex were unaffected . shRNA - mediated Mtss2 knockdown in vivo prevented these changes ( Chatzi et al . , 2019 ) , suggesting postsynaptic targeting of Mtss2 mRNA or protein to activated synapses . These changes peaked at 3 days post - stimulus , a time course consistent with activity - dependent rearrangement of the synaptic circuit . Given the presence of other I - BARs at these synapses , it is possible that there is a coordinated action of multiple I - BAR proteins for activity - dependent plasticity of dendritic spines . The spatial and temporal profile of these proteins in synaptic plasticity maintenance and brain function is intriguing , given the potential interactions of the I - BAR subfamily by heteroligomerization . For example , overexpression in vitro recruits MIM to the dendritic membrane in a PIP 2 - dependent manner , resulting in its oligomerization and the induction of dendritic filopodia , often precursors of dendritic spines ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . I - BAR Heteroligomerization and Inhibition Given the presence of three I - BAR proteins at synapses , it is intriguing to consider whether BAR - BAR heteroligomerization has a role in dendritic spine formation and synaptic plasticity . BAR domain proteins usually associate with a superfamily member with a similar domain organization . However , it is unclear whether this association occurs through heterodimerization or side - by - side interaction of homodimers . For example , heterodimeric BAR domain complexes of the islet cell autoantigen of 69 kDa ( ICA69 ) with PICK1 regulate AMPA receptor trafficking and prevent the formation of PICK1 homomeric complexes ( Cao et al . , 2007 ) . Oligomers between similar BAR domain proteins can also modulate their function ( Charrier et al . , 2012 ) . The iF - BAR domain of srGAP2 ( srGAP2C ) occurs naturally in humans and inhibits SRGAP2 by dimerization ( Charrier et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , expression of SRGAP2C results in phenotypes similar to SRGAP2 deficiency , including neoteny during spine maturation and increased density of longer spines ( Charrier et al . , 2012 ) . Such interactions have not yet been reported for I - BAR subfamily members , but their combinatorial association could considerably expand their role in synapse formation and postsynaptic plasticity . SUMMARY Although the role of BAR proteins in membrane curvature is well known in non - neuronal cells , emerging evidence suggests that the I - BAR subfamily expressed in the central nervous system have an important role in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines at excitatory synapses . The activity - dependence of Mtss2 expression also raises the possibility that the I - BAR subfamily is directly involved in structural and functional plasticity that underlies both developmental events as well as activity - dependent reorganization of synaptic networks . The overlapping expressions of the three I - BAR proteins in the hippocampus and other neuronal circuits begs the question of what mechanisms regulate their precise recruitment to the right synapses and at the right time . One possibility is that homodimerization and heterodimerization between Mtss2 and MIM / IRSp53 could act as activity - dependent on - off switches respectively . Critical to assessing these possibilities are experiments to address input - specific plasticity—synaptic tagging for differential subcellular localization of I - BARs . New tools have to be developed to bridge the gap between molecular , biochemical , and structural observations in vitro and in vivo . For example , recent advances in cell biology with controlled expression levels of protein tags ( CRISPR / Cas9 ) together with super resolution microscopy and 3D imaging should allow quantification and subcellular localization in the future of the densities of I - BAR proteins revealing their role in synaptic function .
