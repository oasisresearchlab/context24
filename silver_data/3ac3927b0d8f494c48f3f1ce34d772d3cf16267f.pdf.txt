As a preliminary study , we conducted self - reported interviews with 30 participants to collect cases of insight learning during the search process . Based on thematic analysis of the data , we summarized the benefits of insight learning during search , described the process of how aha ! occurred after impasse , and identified the antecedent , key , and consequence of insight during the search process . We aimed to help generate more insights by providing three dimensions of key factors to think about . A preliminary understanding of the insights formed in this study could contribute to further discussion about learning during the search and could help design new search tools that support effective learning .

Besides such traditional search interaction modes , there appears to be a trend t (cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:93)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3) quickly and effectively as possible , e . g . , through question - answering systems , conversational systems , or artificial intelligence - generated content ( such as ChatGPT ) . However , we may ask , is this the best way for users to acquire information ? What is the most important goal for a search system nowadays ? Recent research on Search as Learning ( SAL ) has also argued that searchers can learn through various search activities rather than just using the information system as a tool to simply find , retrieve , and collect information ( Rieh et al . , 2015 ) . From this perspective , search is not just an aid to learning but learning itself . Learning is not the simple acceptance of external information but involves the active selection , understanding , and utilization of information , which is a complex information processing activity . Therefore , it is not profound enough for users to take the simple accumulation of facts as learning , and search systems need to be reconfigured to support more diverse types of learning beyond knowledge acquisition ( Rieh et al . , 2016 ) . We should draw on what we have learned from learning science and other related disciplines to consider how to design search systems to support users in learning new knowledge , increasing their information literacy , and making sense of information rather than simply getting a piece of relevant information . In this paper , we introduce the concept of insight learning into the search process to inspire the design of future learning - driven search systems and provide another perspective for SAL discussions . Imagine a child who is learning about the world for the first time and is amazed by each discovery , and another child who is typically taught by pieces of information . Both are important in understanding the way the learning process functions , but one of the biggest advantages of insight learning is its efficiency . Insight often refers to the sudden realization of the solution that pops into the mind unexpectedly , evoking an aha ! moment ( Durso et al . , 1994 ; Sandkühler & Bhattacharya , 2008 ; Kounios & Beeman , 2014 ) . Just like Newton and that apple and Archimedes in the bathtub , one common pattern of insight was shared : a person encountering impasse after an endeavor temporarily removes themselves from the task and then finds themselves surprised by the sudden resolution ( Osuna - Mascaró & Auersperg , 2021 ) . Other similar concepts to insights include inspiration and the aha ! moment . Insight may emphasize more on the overall response , while inspiration refers to the idea itself ; insight can occur without inspiration ( Oleynick et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , insight is frequently linked to a number of features , such as impasse and Aha ! , that set it apart from conventional learning ( Osuna - Mascaró & Auersperg , 2021 ) . Aha ! ( also known as Aha ! moment or Aha ! experience ) is the subjective experience of feeling joy and accomplishment when the solution emerged while insight or insight learning consisted of the overall process . Nowadays , conventional information accumulation - based learning through search systems is readily available . However , it is not clear whether and how search systems could provide insights for learning or insights that facilitate increased efficiency and transfer of learning . Exploring insight in the field of information search may have several ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 422 Long Papers benefits . First , insights could help searchers further deepen their thinking , broaden their minds , and even foster creativity . Second , the joy of learning new insights during the search process , as a positive emotion , could increase (cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:78)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:88)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3) impressive solutions could benefit searchers in dealing with similar difficult situations in the subsequent search process , so as to improve their learning performance and information literacy . The idea of insight learning in information science is not brand new and has been explored in several scenarios , including creating a library creative environment to better trigger insight moments ( Anderson , 2011 ) , insight during the serendipity process ( Makri , 2014 ) , and observing the eureka effect in patent prior art finding ( Yang , Luo , & Wing , 2015 ) . However , not much exploration has been done to examine insight learning during the search process yet . This study aims to examine the benefits and process of the insight learning process during information search . Specifically , we explored the following four research questions ( RQs ) in this paper : RQ1 : What benefits could searchers gain through insight learning during the information search ? RQ2 : When does the aha ! moment usually occur during the search ? RQ3 : What stages have searchers experienced during the insight learning process ? RQ4 : What are the key factors that could trigger insight learning during the search ? LITERATURE REVIEW Before conducting our own research , we reviewed recent studies on Search as Learning , insight learning in learning science research , and some empirical studies on search difficulties and solutions . Research in Search as Learning Insight learning is related to the field of Search as Learning in that they both stress learning during search . Research in the SAL field has investigated the learning process during search as well as the learning performance after search . Searching is often considered a learning process , and it is critical for searchers to learn both domain knowledge and search skills , e . g . , how to critically seek , evaluate , and use information for various search tasks ( Rieh et al . , 2016 ) . (cid:58)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3) learning gains in domain knowledge . For example , the learning in Moraveji and his colleagues ( 2011 ) was realized in the form of tactical search feature tips that expand user awareness of task - relevant tools and features of the search application and demonstrate search efficiency . Wilson and Wilson ( 2013 ) proposed analyzing handwritten summaries as indicators of measuring open - ended learning based on Bloom ' s taxonomy and evaluating the learning performance from different perspectives . Recently , Urgo and Arguello ( 2022 ) summarized methods and measures to evaluate learning performance in search - as - learning based on prior work . However , not much research has examined whether searchers gain any new search skills after they complete a search task , whether they have gained any deep understanding of domain knowledge , or whether they have found solutions to any problems . Although Search as Learning can be challenging , various tools and features were designed to facilitate or support learning from different perspectives during search . For example , Huurdeman , Wilson , and Kamps ( 2016 ) pointed out that , without cluttering simple searches , features less commonly found in web search interfaces , when presented at the right moment , could provide value for users . Roy et al . ( 2021 ) proposed that highlighting and note - taking tools built into the search interface in a SAL environment could help learners cover more facts and subtopics . Ward & Capra ( 2021 ) proposed OrgBox as a knowledge representation tool to support complex search tasks by creating (cid:179)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:91)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:93)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:17) SearchIdea , which enabled searchers to actively interact with search results by comparison , prioritization , and rearrangement and was currently introduced by Chavula , Choi , and Rieh ( 2023 ) , could also be a valuable tool to support learning during search . However , there has not been much investigation into how to provide searchers with insight during their searches . We hope our preliminary exploration of this topic can shed light on this direction . Insight Learning in Learning Science Research Insight learning has been widely discussed and implemented in learning - related science . The theory of insight learning was first proposed by one of the founders of Gestalt psychology , Wolfgang Köhler . Gestalt theory emphasizes the holistic nature of experience and behavior , and insight learning emphasizes problem solving in context , the essence of which is to engage in a completely new way ( Köhler , 1969 ) . Research in many fields has shown that insight learning has significant advantages in enhancing learning and memory ( Danek et al . , 2013 ; Danek & Wiley , 2020 ) , which could be related to the enhancement of learning abilities , the promotion of memory migration , and the development of higher mental faculties and result in the most effective learning . It could be concluded that , different from conventional ways of learning , insight places more emphasis on the suddenness and efficiency of the solution and encourages one to be involved in the task in a brand new and creative way , hence leaving a deep impression and bringing out joyful feelings . ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 423 Long Papers There are several features that make insight learning unique , such as impasse and aha ! ( Osuna - Mascaró & Auersperg , 2021 ) . Insights learning described in our study refers to a process . When no further progress can be made and an impasse is met ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) , a sudden solution may come up , resulting in representation restructuring ( Stuyck , Cleeremans , & Bussche , 2021 ) , which leads to a deeper understanding of the problem and is followed by the aha ! moment , a unique experience represented by positive emotions that results from uncovering the solution to the problem ( Danek et al . , 2014 ) . The word impasse is most commonly used instead of difficulty to describe the struggling situation that individuals experience before the aha ! moments occur . Therefore , in the current study , we will also use the word (cid:179)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:180)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:69)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:3) difficulties and frustrations that lead to search stagnation . Researchers have also explored several influential factors , such as different levels of mental preparation ( Tian et al . , 2011 ) and interactivity conditions ( Henok , Vallée - Tourangeau , & Vallée - Tourangeau , 2020 ) , that trigger insight learning . The release of restrictions allowed the brain to be freed from its solidified framework and wa (cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:179)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:83) - (cid:88)(cid:83)(cid:180) of insights ( Knoblich et al . , 1999 ) . Search Difficulties and Solutions Before aha ! appears during insight learning , there will generally be an impasse stage . It could be inferred naturally that search difficulties could also be experienced before aha ! during information searches . Therefore , we reviewed empirical studies on search difficulty in the research field of information search . We reviewed the difficulties in complex searches as a reference for the impasse before the aha ! moment appeared . Research on task difficulty sought to unveil the reasons that create a sense of difficulty for searchers . For example , Liu , Kim , and Creel ( 2015 ) categorized frequent causes of difficulty into three dimensions : complexity , uncertain information needs , and domain - specific knowledge . It was found that common reasons leading to task difficulty were specific requirements and too much ( unrelated ) information based on the data collected in a controlled lab experiment . Various difficulty reasons could be linked with the different task types and different levels of topic knowledge among searchers ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . More research efforts have been devoted to generating predictive models of task difficulty using behavioral evidence . It was found that the perceived difficulty of tasks was often closely related to more complex queries , more advanced operators , the dwell time of content pages , the dwell time of Search Engine Results Pages ( SERPs ) , the number of content pages visited , etc . ( Aula , Khan , & Guan , 2010 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ) . Average query interval duration , average document dwell time , and SERPs dwell time can effectively predict task difficulty ( Liu , Liu , & Belkin , 2014 ) . It was also found that using only a limited number of important behavioral variables could obtain high prediction accuracy ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , research that took query intervals as timestamps to generate predictive models of task difficulty demonstrated that the predictive models were effective for first - round prediction , meaning that it was possible to predict task difficulty at the very beginning of the searching process ( Liu , Liu , & Belkin , 2014 ; Arguello , 2014 ) . It can be seen that when searchers encounter search difficulties , they will adjust and change their search behaviors . However , there are still unanswered questions : What are the search difficulties that users solved themselves ? What are the search difficulties that users eventually give up or compromise on ? What kind of experience have users had in the process of solving difficulties ? In order to analyze , discover , and understand insight learning during search , we will focus on those cases where participants have tried multiple times to solve the impasse and finally accomplished and obtained insight learning . METHODOLOGY We adopted qualitative research methods to carry out this exploratory research since we had limited understanding of insight during the information search . In this section , we reported on participants , data collection , and data analysis processes . Participants Online questionnaires were distributed to recruit participants for the interview and collect cases of insight learning during the search . The questionnaires were designed by both authors and then distributed mainly to students at Peking University through Wechat ( a popular social platform ) , the university BBS , and online recruitment group chats using an online survey platform ( wjx . cn ) . The main target group was university students because we believed that they had more experience searching for information and were more likely to generate insight . In the questionnaire , we first explained the definition of insight learning and then encouraged participants to recall their specific experiences that contained insight learning during search recently , fill in the description of the search task , impasse , and insight , and explain how insight occurred . They were also asked to score the impasse feelings before insight , the sudden degree when insight appears , and the degree of surprise and joy after insight . Participants were also asked whether they would like to participate in the follow - up interviews . 257 questionnaires were collected . We gave preference to the participants whose cases did not overlap with others and who reported cases with stronger ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 424 Long Papers feelings during the search process , as relevant feelings could be regarded as indicators of insight . Finally , a total of 30 participants engaged in the interview based on the consideration of data and theoretical saturation , reporting a total of 33 cases ( P1 , P6 , and P7 , reported 2 cases ) . Participants were balanced in gender ( 15 males and 15 females each ) , aged between 18 and 32 . Their education level included undergraduate ( 13 participants ) , master ' s ( 12 participants ) , and Ph . D . ( 5 participants ) , and their disciplines included humanities , social sciences , science , engineering , arts , sports , etc . Their cases could be largely divided into four types of topics : learning ( e . g . , looking for research methods , P17 ) , work ( e . g . , helping with the publicity work , P29 ) , entertainment ( e . g . , looking for horror movies to watch , P28 ) , and life ( e . g . , aiming to buy similar pants , P16 ) , etc . The source of the task may be endogenous ( e . g . , preparing for the interview , P7 , T7 - 1 ) , assigned ( e . g . , assigned by the instructor , P23 ) , or cooperative ( e . g . , helping a friend find information for an exam , P20 ) . Self - report Interview The related research pointed out that self - report data collection methods should be included in the research on investigating the insight process ( Danek et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , the self - report interview was adopted in our study to collect data . The outline of the interviews was primarily based on the research questions of this study . Further , we conducted four pilot interviews to test the understanding of insights gained from our initial explanations and the feasibility of interview outlines . After receiving the feedback , we made minor adjustments and began the official interview . Before the interview , we first sought the informed consent of the participants . By giving appropriate guidance with illustrations of the search process and the initial concept of insights , we checked with the participants that they understood the purpose of the interview . Then the interviews began according to the interview outline . The interview outline consisted of five fixed questions : What was the search that you were searching for ? What impasses did you encounter during your search ? What solutions did you come up with ? How did you come up with the final solution ? What helped you generate insight ? During the interviews , the participants were allowed to express themselves fully without interruptions , while follow - up questions ( such as : Did you solve this task as you regularly do ? What did insight mean to you during your search ? When did insight occur during the information search ? What would the procedure be like when insights occurred during the search ? ) were used to ensure that the interviews did not deviate from the research purpose and enrich details . The interview was conducted from January 18 th to March 17 th , 2022 . Each interview lasted as long as the participants needed ( from 45 minutes to 90 minutes ) . All the interviews were conducted using Tencent Meeting to record the audio . As compensation for their time and efforts , participants will receive RMB 30 for each case reported . The first author conducted the interviews and wrote down observational notes . Thematic Analysis The research goal of this study was to develop an initial understanding of the insights learned during the search process . Toward this end , we adopted a primarily inductive thematic analysis approach ( Braun & Clarke , 2021 ) to (cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:92)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:93)(cid:72)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:3) into a pre - existing coding framework . After anonymization , the interviews were transcribed verbatim . During the data analysis procedure , following the thematic analysis procedure , the collected data in the interview were summarized and transformed into coded sentences to generate themes by QSR Nvivo 12 . 0 . The coding of themes was discussed repeatedly by both authors to better extract themes and categorize the codes . We regularly checked subjective intercoder agreement during the coding process , as past researchers have done ( Magee & Simpson , 2019 ) . FINDINGS This section presented our preliminary findings with respect to each of the RQs . RQ1 : What benefits do searchers gain through insight learning during the information search ? In order to identify and analyze the benefits of insight for the search , we asked searchers to compare the search process with and without insight . In summary , participants have shared three aspects of the significant gains during the search , as follows : In terms of the search process , insights made searchers feel much happier and could improve their confidence in their own judgment , thus avoiding delays and completing the task as soon as possible , such as " with this method ( the method triggered by insight ) , it might be more efficient . ( P23 ) " In terms of task completion , the appearance of insight helped searchers gain a deep impression of the search process and created a sense of satisfaction and a long - lasting memory for completing the task , thus facilitating searchers ' ability to accumulate lessons learned and migrate and disseminate them to other search task solution paths . For example , P22 mentioned , " If it ( a similar situation ) comes up again in the future , it will definitely be very easy to solve it " . ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 425 Long Papers In terms of the feelings of searchers , the insight made searchers feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction , enhanced familiarity with the task topic , and could even satisfy their need for social interaction , as P6 addressed : " I would definitely introduce Quark ( the search engine she had used to solve the task ) to others about this function " . RQ2 : When does the aha ! moment occur during the search ? In order to address RQ2 , we analyzed participants (cid:182) answers to the question of when aha ! ( the joyful feeling after breaking impasses ) occurred during the information search . It is found that before the aha ! occurs , searchers often experience impasses . Therefore , in this part , we first described impasses at different stages and how aha ! occurred to overcome that impasse . In order to better analyze how the impasse was eventually broken , we adopted the four subprocesses summarized by Liu et al . ( 2021 ) , which summarized four main stages based on the Information Seeking Model ( Marchionini , 1995 ) , namely : Understanding and Planning ( including Recognize & Accept and Define Problem ) , Searching and Execution ( including Select Source , Formulate Query , and Execute Query ) , Examination ( corresponding to Examine Results ) , and Use ( including Extract Information , Reflect , Iterate & Stop ) . It was found that searchers have experienced different impasses at different stages , and they would identify different strategies that finally helped them solve these impasses ; these strategies include clarifying , reviewing , switching , and reformulating . Before describing how they adopted different strategies , we first explain each of these four strategies in the current study . Clarifying is to redefine , understand , and possibly decompose the current task . Reviewing (cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:90)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:89)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:83)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3) the summarized patterns during this particular search process . By reviewing the search history , summarizing the search experience , and connecting with existing knowledge and experience , searchers can break the limits of their thinking patterns or rediscover the possible ideas that lead to new breakthroughs . Switching ( which mostly represents the switching of information sources ) could also be used ( e . g . , from a database to a search engine and vice versa ) to trigger aha ! . Reformulating , including generalization , specialization , word substitution , repetition , and a new query ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) , refers to the reformulation of search queries and also serves as an important information search strategy . The four strategies could be used in combination . The main impasse and the main strategies searchers came up with were described in the following subsections . Understanding and Planning Stage The main impasse reported by four participants in this stage was the inability to understand the goal of the task and express it properly to the search systems . In this stage , searchers who experienced impasse and insights were not clear about the information they needed to complete the task at the beginning of their search because they perceived the task to be complicated or exploratory . For example , two participants described their impasses as below : " If you know exactly what research method you want to use , you can do it straightforwardly , but I did not know what method I could use at that time , so I did not know what to search for at the beginning . ( P3 ) " " Something went wrong right at the beginning ; it ( referring to a word ) was mentioned in the recording , but I did not know what this was exactly . ( P23 ) " Rather than just trying different random solutions , insight learning required more comprehension . Learners aimed to understand the relationships among the pieces of the puzzle . In the Understanding and Planning stage , the impasses were mainly solved by clarifying and reviewing strategies ; an example of clarifying strategy was from P3 : " I later found out that I didn ' t really need to know what method to use , but rather I needed to identify a research question . And this website , when I clicked on it , already offered the research question . ( P3 ) " When receiving a task and preparing to search , searchers could be frustrated due to a lack of clear ideas and plans for task completion . The search systems , especially those that present well - structured information , covered a large amount of relevant information that could create the possibility of providing new ideas or helping the searchers accumulate knowledge . Reviewing the pattern of this search process could help locate the intersection between existing knowledge and what the information system can offer , such as : " After this word appeared repeatedly , I was able to realize that this word starting with the letter B could be a personal name . Because the oral history went like this based on my past experience and the name had a specific pattern of pronunciation . ( P23 ) " Searching and Execution Stage The main difficulty in the Search and Execution stage was formulating a proper query when lacking background knowledge and task information , as reported by four participants . For example : " I intended to describe the flower , but there was really no particularly good description . ( P6 , T6 - 1 ) " . We found that if a searcher did not find satisfactory results in the current information source by using queries constructed on existing information , switching was found to be an effective strategy . Also , the searcher could be guided toward reviewing existing knowledge to help expand their ideas . In other words , helping the searcher review and associate the current task with existing knowledge or experience would be necessary at this stage . Switching and reviewing (cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:69)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:25)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:78)(cid:29) " My idol endorsed this search engine ( referring ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 426 Long Papers to Quark ) . So I decided to use it instead . And I found a camera icon on the home page . It turned out that that icon could recognize the picture , and then the type of flower immediately came out . ( P6 , T6 - 1 ) " Examination Stage Participants were most likely to encounter impasses during the Examination stage , based on the fact that most of our participants experienced difficulties during this stage . The examination stage included the evaluation of SERP pages and in - document examinations . Further , we subdivided it into two parts : Browsing and Evaluation . The browsing impasse lies in the searcher ' s experience during the browsing process , i . e . , whether the searcher is easily distracted or has a long duration . Here was an example of distraction : " Without being fully engaged in it , it was easy to get sidetracked and likely to be drawn away by interesting posts on other topics . ( P20 ) " . The reviewing strategy has been reported to be the most important strategy when searchers encounter difficulties in browsing , such as " I later found that there was no way to find the relevant information through various channels , and then I remembered that I had joined some group chats before and found answers there , then suddenly I thought , why not try this way to see if I could find people for advice ? ( P20 ) " Evaluation impasses occur when the quality and quantity of the information are unsatisfactory . As for the evaluation impasses , if there was a problem with the quality of the information , the searcher could be guided to switching and reformulating strategies . The dilemma went like this : searchers could sometimes solve their tasks by switching strategies . However , due to the fact that searchers ' task solving was strongly influenced by their preconceptions and habits , they would always choose the regular search strategy they used most . In general , relying on previous paths to solve tasks helped searchers deal with familiar tasks efficiently , but it also prevented searchers from seeing better solutions in different or unfamiliar environments . If it was a problem of information quantity , the searcher could be guided in reviewing and reformulating (cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:84)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3) own could be demanding ; hence , search suggestions based on their past search history , such as reference queries or search paths when solving similar problems , could also be helpful . By offering alternative query choices like this , it could trigger searchers to continue solving the problem . When the searcher taped into and further expressed his or her new , real needs in a form that was more in line with the implicit needs , new queries could be formed and the tasks subsequently solved . Specifically , if the system presented too much information , then it could inspire the searcher to decompose the task , narrow the target , and specify . For example , P16 saw " someone on the street wearing a pair of good - looking pants " . But relying only on image recognition , there was " too much " content to be recognized . After several attempts , he tried to add the " key feature " of the pants , the text " chain " , to the query . Use Stage A total of seven searchers reported impasses during the use stage . At this stage , the searcher may not be able to extract information from the system (cid:182)(cid:86) feedback . Or the searcher has collected a certain amount of information , but the information is not convenient for the searcher to carry out subsequent operations . For example , " at that time , I was helping my senior apprentice analyze data using time series analysis , but we found that the data could not pass the stability test . So we were looking for ways to pass the test . But no matter how hard we looked for it , all kinds of methods could not fit in ( P13 ) . " Confronted with this during the use stage , searchers like P13 tended to rely on a clarifying strategy : " Later , I felt that I had trapped myself . So we started from the most primitive task purpose , that is , what method we can use to analyze this data instead of focusing on solving the stability problem , and then the new method came up . " We could assume that the search engine itself provides a large amount of information , which may invariably enter the searcher ' s subconscious and facilitate the searcher ' s utilization of it in some form later in the search process . Furthermore , if this information was presented in a structured , organized form that was consistent with the searcher ' s mental model , it would be easier for the searcher to utilize the information . RQ3 : What stages have searchers experienced during the insight learning process ? This study considered insight learning during search from the perspective of the process . We identified three stages that existed during the insight learning process : impasse , incubation , and reconstruction . We have discussed impasse in the previous section and mainly discussed incubation and reconstruction in this section . Further , we located their roles during the search , namely , impasse as the antecedent , incubation as the key , and reconstruction as the consequence . Insight learning during the information search process went like this : during the search process , information accumulation and comprehension were completed , which laid the foundation for breaking impasses . There would be impasses at different stages of the information search , especially in the Examination stage . However , impasses may be broken by incubation . Finally , reconstruction was made to complete the task . Impasse as the Antecedents Impasse has long been recognized as an inherent aspect and hallmark of insight , and in our study , it meant when a seeker was stuck ; he or she could have tried many unsuccessful trials and did not know how to move forward . The findings of RQ2 have described what impasses seekers often encounter at different stages , which will not be ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 427 Long Papers elaborated again in this section , but we would like to emphasize that impasses should be regarded as the antecedent to insight learning . Incubation as the Key Why can some impasses be resolved while others are abandoned in the end ? It was found that the core was in the critical stage of incubation . Incubation benefited from information accumulation and comprehension during the information search process . When the searcher interacted with the system , the information provided by the system continued to pour into the searcher ' s mind , some of which was understood and some of which was accumulated . The understood and accumulated information fused with the structured knowledge in the searcher ' s mind to trigger an insight . During the interview , when asked to reflect on their insight , P2 suggested that the main reason for the insight was " the accumulation of literature over a long period of time " . However , if searchers focused too much on the task itself , they could get stuck and , therefore , enter the incubation stage by taking a break or trying to do something else . For P2 , the incubation was formed by escaping from the task and taking a meal instead : " The break helped me a lot . I felt like I had been exploring but with no results , and that was exhausting . I just thought I ' d have a quick meal and then come back and continue searching , as a new beginning . " As the key to insight , incubation made searchers jump out of the box and form new angles to scrutinize , such as " After the break , I began to wonder if I was going in the wrong direction . I deeply believed that I should switch my thoughts , like maybe I should start from the collections of monographs on archaeological sites . . . ( P2 ) . " Reconstruction as the Consequence The emergence of aha ! was certainly gratifying , but it was not the last stage of the insight learning process . Reconstruction , as a result , may occur afterwards as a following action , as P4 says , " I had to go through that previous search process again , although I was finally clear on the keywords I was searching for . " Restructuring meant changing the initial solution idea to form a new one , reconstructing the previous behavior , and putting it into task resolution in a new way , thus hitting the final solution of the task . We also found that searchers immediately engaged in the process of completing the task after the insight occurred : " just bought it straight away ( P16 ) " and " immediately followed the actions in the video ( P22 ) " , probably because searchers often experienced an extremely strong sense of meaning and achievement from the insight , and this positive emotional experience helped them to further invest their energy . RQ4 : What are the key factors that could trigger insight learning during the search ? This research question aimed to address why some of the participants experienced aha ! during the search while others did not . During the interview , we asked the participants to recall what helped them trigger insight learning . Specifically , three key factors that trigger insight learning from the emerging codes were identified : metacognition , emotion , and information systems . Metacoginition Metacognition , often discussed in the field of information search behavior nowadays , could help identify key information , make connections , and be critical for task solving . At present , there is no uniformity in metacognition strategies . When exploring insight cases , we found the following six metacognition strategies : prediction , planning , monitoring , selective focus , adjustment , and evaluation . Prediction means that the searchers who believe they have a greater possibility of completing the tasks would help them break the impasse , such as " I think this task was easy to find the solution because I think my search ability in the entertainment field was relatively good ( P1 , T1 - 2 ) " . Planning refers to setting goals ( Ward & Capra , 2021 ) , and if the searchers have a clear understanding of the solution process from a macro and general perspective or are able to make a general plan for their own completion , it will help to trigger insights . As P4 illustrated , " I am actually a person who has a fixed plan every day ; my task that day was to find relevant literature . I felt like I had to get this job done no matter what " . Monitoring the feasibility of the searcher ' s ideas and the progress of obtaining information would also help ( Ward & Capra , 2021 ; Crescenzi , 2016 ) , such as " I have been exploring for such a long time and I believed I should take a break ( P2 ) " . Through monitoring , searchers may be able to rationalize their rest and thus enter the incubation period . Selective focus refers to narrowing down to the key point while leaving all other elements in the frame out of focus , such as " My search range was too large ; I want to narrow it down , so I decided to recall the specific details of the pants ( P16 ) " . Adjustment represents the cognitive behavior of adjusting ideas or thinking patterns , such as " selecting the research method according to the research purpose only ( P13 ) " . Evaluation refers to the searcher ' s evaluation of the current achievement relative to the prospected final results during the search process ( Ward & Capra , 2021 ) , such as " Toward this end , I first analyzed why I had this problem and felt that I didn ' t think about this topic very clearly ( P17 ) " . By assessing the difference between the ideal goal and the current state , searchers may be able to clarify goals for the next phase . ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 428 Long Papers Emotion Among many variables that have been shown to predict the emergency of aha ! , emotion was one of the most widely studied predictors ( Orita & Hattori , 2019 ) . Both positive and negative emotions could promote the occurrence of insights . Positive emotions could promote the efficient allocation of attentional resources ( Orita & Hattori , 2019 ) , (cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:68)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:70)(cid:76)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:182) searches of the problem space . An example of being calm and relaxed would be : " I calmed myself down and asked myself to breathe deeply . And I decided to think about what the teacher said and tried to extract possible keywords , and it occurred to me ( P25 ) . " An example of being confident would be : " I was confident that the task would be solved successfully . Because I felt that there must be an answer , it could just be hidden , so I just had this confidence from nowhere ( P29 ) . " While negative emotions may force searchers to be more focused on the current tasks ( Orita & Hattori , 2019 ) , an example of being doubtful would be : " I thought the biggest point was that because of my doubt , I was also forced to rush . I probably based it on this skepticism , and then I started looking through the previous ones , and I found it in it ( P14 ) . " It seemed that it was the intensity of the emotional feelings that triggered the insight learning rather than whether the emotion was positive or negative . Information System It wa (cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:92)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:81)(cid:82)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:80)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:89)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:86)(cid:78)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:79)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:85) answers but also be able to trigger insights for searchers . According to the self - reported data , if the system could provide more aggregated and fine - grained search results and help visualize (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:182)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:83)(cid:3) searchers process information faster and contribute to insight learning . First , the system should provide well - organized information that is easily absorbed by searchers , such as a collection of relevant topics . An example would be : " ( This system ) provided a collection of monographs , which was absolutely more convenient ( P2 ) " . Provide more fine - grained information , which could save searchers time from finding detailed information and reduce the chance of information disorientation , such as " I entered aesthetics , but the system fed me the book . The key words and title of this book had nothing to do with aesthetics , but there was a highlighted paragraph in it that mentions aesthetics , which gave me a lot of inspiration ( P24 ) " . As P1 said , when she visualized the searcher ' s search path , she " actually summarized experiences based on multiple times on the search and then made a summary of all the valid paths on my own , which was very energy - consuming . " Therefore , if the search engine " could provide a complete path of how to search and directly summarize what these effective paths have in common " , then it may largely contribute to the insight . DISCUSSION This paper explored the benefits of insight learning during search , which resulted in joyful , impressive , and meaningful learning , as well as when and how insight learning occurred , and finally summarized factors that might contribute to the generation of insight learning . In this section , we first discussed how insight learning was related to search difficulties and solutions , and then further elaborated on the power of incubation and connected insight learning during search with serendipity during information browsing . Finally , design implications and future work were proposed . Search Difficulties and Solutions People may need to seek help from search systems for difficult and complex tasks . One possible solution was to keep searchers from encountering difficulties or help them avoid them in advance . For example , Information Fostering ( Shah , 2018 ) aimed to predict potential problems searchers may encounter and provide help ( such as a document or a strategy ) to overcome those problems . Another possible solution was that when the searcher encountered difficulties , instead of helping the searcher avoid or solve them , the system could offer clues to solutions , allowing the searcher to solve the difficulties on their own . Impasse was a significant contributing factor to the insight revelation as it encouraged the appearance of errors to be fixed ( Dubey et al . , 2021 ) . In this study , we investigated cases where searchers overcame the search difficulties ( so - called " impasses " ) either by themselves or through suggestions by the search systems and had impressive search experiences , so as to infer indications for the design of the search system from the second perspective . In our preliminary study , we identified four strategies that searchers found effective : clarifying , reviewing , switching , and reformulating . The strategies identified in the current study may seem familiar to some of the search experts ( Bates , 1979 ; Aula & Kellar , 2009 ; Buscher et al . , 2012 ) , but they were found to be very insightful and effective for searchers in our study . The reasons for this might be that these searchers were not very familiar with these strategies or that the current search systems did not fully support or explicitly suggest these strategies . Therefore , when they came up with these strategies and found them effective , they found them very impressive . Previous studies have identified search tactics and search strategies but have not explored how to teach or guide searchers to use different strategies for different tasks or difficulties . In this study , we found that the key for searchers to experience insight learning during search was to help them jump out of their existing or limited thinking framework and try new and creative strategies when trying to solve difficulties during search or learning . ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 429 Long Papers The Power of Incubation During the Information Search Incubation is a typical phenomenon of creativity that occurs in insight learning . The power of incubation in learning - related fields may be explained by the British educator Wallas ( 1926 ) , who suggested that the key step to insight was the incubation period . The incubation period was characterized by being repeatedly thought about at first ( refer to the information accumulation and comprehension in our study ) , taking a break or releasing the focus , and then allowing previous information to enter the mind unconsciously . A final solution via restructuring old and new information could thereby be achieved . As the key to insight learning , incubation also played a vital role during the search for information . After trying repeatedly but unsuccessfully to reach an impasse , the searcher could move on to the incubation stage . At this point , the inherent limitations were lifted , the knowledge accumulated during the search process formed an interconnected system , and individuals rearranged disorganized or useless resources in a meaningful way , but only if the searchers were able to think outside the box , using strategies such as clarifying , reviewing , switching , or reformulating . Insight learning could not be achieved in any single attempt but was gradually acquired through various cognitive and behavioral thinking processes . Although incubation seemed to refer to relaxation and the release of constraints in its literal meaning , it also meant information accumulation and comprehension and involved efforts to think outside the box . Traditional information - seeking models have (cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:69)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:41)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:83) le , the Berry Picking Model described the searching process as bit by bit based on the information gathered along the way ( Bates , 1989 ) , and Information Foraging Theory ( Pirolli & Card , 1999 ) argued that (cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182) search behaviors would adapt with the change of (cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:74)(cid:81)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:73)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:81)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:3) information into existing cognitive structures may lead to the creation of new cognitive structures , or reconstructions . We also like to argue that even though insight learning seems like a sudden increase of information , the incubation stage , as a stage to step back , relax , and reorganize their acquired information , may also be important for searchers to solve problems or gain new knowledge . Incubation has been identified as one of the (cid:70)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:88)(cid:71)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:68)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3) seeking behaviors and creation processes during independent topic selection as a type of creative learning task ( Li , Liu , & Hansen , 2023 ) . The definition of incubation was adopted from Hadamard ( 1954 ) , which emphasized continuous work on the creative task rather than rest and relaxation . Selection and exploration in Kuhlthau ' s ISP model were matched with the incubation stage . People belonging to the incubation type spent the longest time in this stage when completing creative tasks . They selected appropriate information and explored the domain to understand and analyze the task in preparation for the final creation . Nevertheless , the incubation processes in this study emphasized taking a break from pre - existing constraints through rest and relaxation . The differences may be caused by the different types of tasks investigated in the two studies . Li , Liu , and Hansen ( 2023 ) focused only on creative learning tasks , and the incubation stage might last relatively long , at least for a couple of days . While the current study only focused on one search session and problem solving , the incubation in our study emphasized the relaxation from struggling and then jumping out of the thinking frame . Particularly , it was found that the insight learning cases that stressed the incubation stage reported by our participants mainly belonged to learning or work - related tasks or were assigned by others . This could indicate that the more restrictive the tasks , the more relaxation may be needed for searchers to jump out of the current status quo . The common part of the incubation concept in both our study and that of Li , Liu , and Hansen ( 2023 ) stressed knowledge accumulation and reservation before the generation of some creative or insightful thoughts . Connections of Insight Learning During the Search with Serendipity During the Browsing This paper examined insight learning during the searching process , and insight has also been mentioned in serendipity - related work . For example , Makri ( 2014 ) proposed that insight learning often occurs when information is unintentionally discovered . He proposed that connection - making was established during browsing between seemingly unrelated information , leading to insights . Insight learning was achieved through the establishment of links between knowledge by extracting structural relationships for knowledge acquisition and application so that searchers had new ideas , behavioral or cognitive changes ( which refers to reconstruction in our study ) , and felt the emotions of surprise and joy ( which refers to aha ! in our study ) ( Makri , Ravem , & Mckay , 2017 ) . If serendipity was defined by Fine and Deegan ( 1996 ) as the unique and contingent mix of insight coupled with chance , then similarly , we could define the insight in the search process as insight coupled with purpose . In the process of serendipity , searchers ' surprising and delightful information from serendipity pushed them to places they had not been before . For insight , the surprise and joy afterwards came not only from the feeling of luck but also from the recognition and satisfaction within oneself that the solution emerged with effort . Furthermore , with more emphasis on goal - directed or task - driven learning , insight learning during search may depend more on incubation to overcome the restriction and proactive problem solving by trying to jump out of the current mindset . How serendipity happened during browsing could also help explain how insight learning happened ASIS & T Annual Meeting 2023 430 Long Papers during search . It may be the case that searchers turn to aimless browsing when they encounter an impasse in completing the tasks , and then the relaxation allows searchers to enter the incubation period so that they may have a better chance of getting useful information for their tasks . The current study also indicated that in the future , the boundary between information search and information browsing may blur , and information systems should allow users to smoothly switch between searching and browsing . Such a mode may also lead to better learning performance . Design Implications This study examined the benefits of insight learning during search and investigated the reason and process of its occurrence , which could shed light on the design of future search systems to support insight learning for users . For example , the findings of RQ2 reveal that reviewing is essential to breaking the impasse . Providing retrospective functions during the search may be helpful . Based on the findings of RQ3 , impasse as the antecedent is a stage at which searchers have tried multiple times but failed , so it is very important for the system to be able to detect such impasse during search and provide timely assistance to trigger insight , such as providing new search strategies or new queries to help describe the information they need . Understanding and the accumulation of information are the basis for insight . However , too much information may make searchers feel disoriented or overloaded . Hence , it is important to provide knowledge graphs or search trails for users and adjust the amount of information supplied (cid:68)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:74)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:88)(cid:69)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:92)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:75)(cid:87)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:92)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:80)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:71) facilitate relaxation or help searchers jump out of their original thinking frame by providing heterogeneous information or reducing the amount of information provided . As addressed in the RQ4 , information systems could offer meta - cognition tools to help users monitor and evaluate , provide more aggregated and fine - grained search results , provide a visualized (cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:3)(cid:83)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:69)(cid:82)(cid:82)(cid:86)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:88)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182) confidence to trigger insight . Limitations and Future Work We acknowledged that this study was preliminary in its exploration of insight learning during information searches . The benefits of insight learning during search were analyzed based on the cases reported by our participants , and they could vary from individual to individual , which meant the insight for one person may not be salient or impressive for another person . However , consistent with the existing research , we regarded searchers ' opinions as an important criterion for judging whether insight occurs ; that is , we considered them the authorities of their own experiences ( Makri , Ravem , & Mckay , 2017 ) . It would also be useful to know how the search tasks and demographic backgrounds were related to their experiences of insight in future work . And it should be further examined to determine the effects of the dimensions of key factors that trigger insight during the search process , using user experiments to validate whether and how these factors could actually promote insights . In this study , insight learning is a process that triggers the aha ! moment during the search . However , we should acknowledge that insight could also be considered an outcome and might be associated with different levels or nuances . Future work is needed to measure insight during search in detail and determine whether it could be inferred from the observation of users (cid:182) interactions or neuro - physiological signals , as well as apply it to the design of search systems or other learning systems . In the future , researchers in the field of SAL should expand the orientation of learning beyond mere knowledge accumulation to assist in the generation of more insights , creativity , etc . Search will not only be a tool to assist in the accumulation of knowledge but will also be an important choice for insight learning . How will solving difficulties in search contribute to learning ? How could critical , impactful , and creative learning emerge ? How do different conditions lead to different types of learning ? These questions were examined briefly in our research , but they merit further investigation . CONCLUSION This preliminary study aimed to introduce the concept of insight learning during search and provide a new perspective on studies on Search as Learning . Through self - reported interviews , this study revealed the benefits of insights in terms of acquiring deep impressions , facilitating the search processes , and enhancing familiarity with the topics . Three key stages of the insight learning process were identified : impasse , incubation , and reconstruction . In addition , the study showed how impasses in different stages were resolved by clarifying , reviewing , switching , and reformulating and were guided to reconstructions . Finally , we summarized meta - cognition , emotion , and the information system as the main factors that could trigger insight learning . By profiling the source of searcher - generated s (cid:82)(cid:79)(cid:88)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:17)(cid:72)(cid:17)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:72)(cid:91)(cid:83)(cid:79)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:74)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:75)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:182)(cid:3)(cid:76)(cid:81)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:75)(cid:87)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:85)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:90)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:3)(cid:80)(cid:68)(cid:78)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:3)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:73)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:3)(cid:87)(cid:82)(cid:90)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:3) learning and help revitalize the future work of task - based information search by proposing the concept of insight and presenting a framing of insight during the search process . More discussion is bound to be needed for insight learning , but in any case , may aha ! be with us ! REFERENCES Anderson , T . D . ( 2011 ) .
