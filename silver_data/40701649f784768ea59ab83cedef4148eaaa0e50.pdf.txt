D . iv Acknowledgements First and foremost , I would like to extend my gratitude to Dr . Lowe - Krentz . Nearly six years ago , she saw something in me that was worth her investment . The summer before I officially started at Lehigh , she invited me to join her BSDI summer project to which I excitedly accepted . Looking back , this was one of the best decisions during my graduate career . It allowed me to “get my feet wet” in the lab and get a jump start on my project . I hate to admit it , but without her contacting me to join her lab for the summer ; I may not have ever considered her lab in the first place . So I guess she knew more about me at the time than I did . Looking back , it was a no - brainer type of decision , because I immediately fell in love with the research and the lab . Dr . Lowe - Krentz has been a true inspiration and an excellent mentor . I don’t think there has been one time when I went to her and she didn’t have an answer to my question or problem . Admittedly , it usually wasn’t the answer that I wanted to hear , but it was always the answer I needed to hear . She is an example of a professor who as devoted her career to top notch research , educating both graduate and undergraduate students , and developing the next generation of scientists and teachers . She has always been there when I needed her , even as far as proof reading this document while on her family vacation . She is the best advisor and mentor that a graduate student could ask for . Secondly , I would like to thank my committee members for their unwavering support and endless help in my many times of need . Aside from their intellectual and scientific support , they have been invaluable in terms of making life biggest choices . Dr . Michael Kuchka for providing me with excellent seats to Iron Pigs baseball games . Dr . Cassimeris for always volunteering to sample my pulled pork and relentlessly arguing with me over Duke Athetlics . Dr . Bryan Berger for introducing me his lab members , especially those who are just as unique as me . On more serious note , I thank Dr . Iovine v for stepping in at the last minute and serving on my committee ; she truly is a life saver . Dr . Cassimeris for making a microscopist and cell biologist out of me . Dr . Bryan Berger for technical help with electroporation . Lastly , I extend my deepest gratitude to Dr . Michael Kuchka for serving as a great example of a dedicated teacher and for the opportunity to guest lecture in his class . I will carry the concepts that I’ve learned watching him teach with me into my own career . I would be amiss if I did not thank my wife , Kyle , who stood by my side through every long night in the lab , studying , writing , reading or whining about failed experiments . I doubt whether I would have been able to complete this program without her support . She rode the roller coaster that a doctoral program is with me . She enjoyed the peaks and suffered through the valleys with me all the while finishing her Master’s degree in Athletic Training , starting a new job , and planning our wedding . No matter how bad of a day that I had , she always found a way to make things better . She was instrumental in my preparation for my qualifying exam . She would sit with me for hours as I described apoptosis , the cell cycle , vesicular transport , etc . Sometimes , I think she might have known it better than me . She truly is the cornerstone of the foundation of our family . I would also like to thank my parents , James and Kathy , for always believing in me . Throughout my life , they have always been right behind me to catch me when I fell and hold me on their shoulders when I succeeded . As true parents , they always put their needs behind mine , so I could pursue my dreams of getting a doctorate degree . They always have and still continue to jump into action whenever I need anything and I appreciate it more than they could ever know . I would also like to thank my step mother Dana for stepping into my life and immediately having a positive influence on me and my father . Another person who deserves my gratitude is Gary for coming into my vi mother’s and my lives and serving as a role model and friend . Lastly , I would like to thank my father - and mother - in - law , Bob and Val , for their continued support of Kyle and me . The entire faculty and staff of the Department of Biological Sciences made my time here at Lehigh much more enjoyable and seamless . There are too many names to list , but there have been times when I’ve walked into someone’s office or lab and needed something to which they immediate provided their assistance . The one person that stands out in particular who needs mentioning is Maria Brace . Although she swears that she isn’t very mother - like to her own children , she served as an excellent mother - substitute to me . I will truly miss our discussions about food , barbeque in particular , politics , current events , and anything we felt like talking about . Maria truly is the lifeblood of the department and helped me out of numerous sticky situations . I am saddened by the thought of no longer being able to walk past her office in the morning to a “good morning , how are you doing ? ” I am forever grateful for her willingness to fix everything , and I literally mean everything . Throughout my time at Lehigh I’ve met many people who have been instrumental to my success . I’ve made colleagues for life and build lasting friendships . Although everyone was extremely helpful , a few people stand out in my mind as being exceedingly wonderful . Dr . Michael Kearse was truly the epitome of the perfect graduate student , always willing to share his knowledge and experience . Dr . Raymond Pugh provided scientific insight , daily kindergarten humor , friendly political debates , and endless conversation . Trista Barthol for literally doing whatever I asked her to in the lab , discussing Northampton High School , blaring country music in the lab with me , and her endless drive to complete lab work . Walter Joseph , Natalie Krane , Amanda Dilger , Annie Suh , and Theresa Collins for making me feel young and hip again . Dr . Wutigri vii Nimlamool for helping me with ECL development and fluorescent microscopy . Lee Graham for never saying “no” when I needed to borrow something from the core or teaching labs and tirelessly working to keep the cell culture hoods operation in our lab . I would also like to thank my mentors from my undergraduate and master’s career , without them I might have mistakenly ended up with an M . D . instead of a Ph . D . I extend my gratitude to : Dr . Deborah Hokien for being the first person to introduce me to research outside of the classroom . Dr . Peter Eden for instilling in me the need to question everything , to not take things at face value , and for being the best teacher I’ve ever had . Lastly , Dr . Kenneth Rundell for giving me the opportunity to do world class research which ultimately had a large part to do with me getting into Lehigh’s Ph . D . program , professional guidance , and a lasting friendship . I’m sure that I am forgetting important people , so I apologize if your name was omitted , but please know that I am thankful in my heart . In closing , I would again like to thank Dr . Lowe - Krentz , my committee , past and current labmates and classmates , Margorie Nemes for establishing the fellowship which supported my work for a semester , the Howard Hughes Medical Institue BDSI program which support my first summer’s research , and the Department of Biological Sciences for their endless support during my time as a Ph . D . student at Lehigh University . viii Table of Contents Acknowledgements iv Table of Contents viii List of Figures xiii List of Tables xv List of Abbreviations xvi Abstract 1 Chapter 1 : Introduction 3 Chapter 2 : General Methods 26 2 . 1 : Cell Culture 27 2 . 2 : Immunofluorescence Staining 28 2 . 3 : SDS -

This disease is caused by injury to the arterial wall , causing an inflammatory response which can become misregulated , and over the lifetime of an individual can lead to plaque formation . Hallmarks of atherosclerotic plaque formation include the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) to the injured site in the arterial wall and endothelial cell dysfunction , both of which contribute to plaque formation . In an attempt to control this unwarranted inflammation and cellular proliferation , heparin has been studied because of its anti - inflammatory and anti - proliferative effects . Unfortunately , the mechanisms by which heparin induces these effects are not well understood . In this study , experiments aimed at identification of a receptor for heparin furthered the understanding of the signaling mechanisms underlying heparin’s anti - inflammatory and anti - proliferative effects . To gain a better understanding of the underlying signaling cascade induced by heparin , various gene expression analyses were performed in heparin - treated VSMCs . While heparin is one of the major signals opposing vascular disease progression , other signals including laminar shear stress also provide similar opposing actions . Along with investigation of heparin signaling , experiments demonstrating a role for cofilin in actin remodeling during laminar shear stress have been completed . Cofilin , a member of the Actin Depolymerizing Factor family of proteins , is an actin severing protein which promotes actin depolymerization from the actin minus end when cofilin is unphosphorylated . This work also underscored the importance of cofilin and actin 2 realignment in shear stress - induced endothelial barrier integrity . The culmination of this work has unveiled a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and the anti - inflammatory effects of heparin and laminar shear stress . 3 Chapter 1 : Introduction 4 Atherosclerosis and its complications claim more lives than any other single disease , and together they are the leading cause of death in Western societies and Japan ( Fan J and Watanabe T 2003 and Rudijanto A 2007 ) . Not only is vascular disease a health concern , it is also a financial issue because it has been predicted that in the United States alone , treatment of patients with vascular disease accounted for health care spending of over $ 300 billion in 2010 ( Heidenreich PA et al . 2009 ) . The cost of treatment of patients with vascular disease is predicted to increase for the foreseeable future with the cost predicted to be well over $ 800 billion by 2030 , not accounting for inflation ( Figure 1 . 1 ) ( Heidenreich PA et al . 2009 ) . Figure 1 . 1 : The cost of treating cardiovascular disease ( Adapted from Heidenreich PA et al . 2009 ) The cost of treating patients with cardiovascular disease correlates with the percentage of the population classified as obese . In a study conducted in 2009 - 2010 , nearly one - third of the United States adult population and almost 17 % of the adolescent population were considered obese ( Ogden CL et al . 2012 ) . These values have been 5 steadily increasing since 1999 and are predicted to increase at the same or a more rapid rate in the future ( Ogden CL et al . 2012 ) . These statistics emphasize the importance of furthering our understanding of the underlying causes of atherosclerosis and potential ways treat it . Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease which occurs in response to an injury to the arterial wall , resulting in endothelial cell dysfunction ( Ross R 1999 , Rudijanto A 2007 , and Libby P , Ridker PM , and Maseri A 2002 ) . The endothelial cell dysfunction can be caused by a variety of factors , but most often it is attributed to elevated Low - Density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) / high cholesterol , diabetes mellitus , abnormally high radicals due to cigarette smoking , high blood pressure , certain genetic alterations , obesity , and pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumonia ( Fan J and Watanabe T 2003 ) ( Figure 1 . 2 ) . Although these factors are known to predispose an individual to the development of atherosclerosis , they do not cause atherosclerosis . Many individuals may have one or multiple of these risk factors and never develop cardiovascular disease . It is also true that some patients do not have any of these risk factors and have advanced cardiovascular disease . The mechanistic relationships between these risk factors and atherosclerosis are still largely unclear . Figure 1 . 2 : Risk factors for atherosclerosis 6 Atherosclerosis begins with an injury to the endothelial cell layer in medium and large sized arteries ( Ross R 1999 , Rudijanto A 2007 , and Libby P , Ridker PM , and Maseri A 2002 ) , and the risk factors detailed above are in some way related to this injury . This initial lesion is called a fatty streak and can be found in infants and young children as well as adults ( Napoli C et al . 1997 ) . Fatty streaks are pure inflammatory lesions consisting of monocyte - derived macrophages and T lymphocytes ( Stary HC et al . 1994 ) . In most cases these inflammatory fatty streaks are resolved , and there is no further build up in these areas . Regardless of the cause of the injury to the arterial wall , endothelial cell dysfunction follows , leading to excessive , chronic inflammation and phenotypic changes in the endothelial cell layer . These changes alter the normal anticoagulant nature of the endothelial layer and change it to a pro - coagulant nature . This pro - coagulant nature triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors , triggering the surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) to become proliferative and migratory ( Ross R 1993 and Ross R 1999 ) . This change in the VSMC layer causes the cells to exit their normal non - proliferative , quiescent , and well - differentiated state and enter the cell cycle , proliferate , and lose their differentiated phenotype . This VSMC proliferation leads to thickening of the arterial wall , often referred to as arterial wall remodeling ( Ross R 1993 and Ross R 1999 ) . Continued inflammation leads to specific gene expression programs resulting in transcription of pro - and anti - inflammatory proteins which affect the attraction of leukocytes and platelets , vascular permeability , coagulation , and ultimately control the 7 course and outcome of the inflammatory reactions ( Viemann D et al . 2006 , Libby P , Ridker PM , and Maseri A 2002 , and reviewed in Libby P 2012 ) . The recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes causes the release of additional inflammatory molecules such as hydrolytic enzymes , cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors leading to more wall damage and the development of a fibrous plaque ( Ross R 1999 , Viemann D et al . 2006 , Libby P , Ridker PM , and Maseri A 2002 , and reviewed in Libby P 2012 ) . Fibrous plaques are the most advanced and dangerous , in that they are generally unstable and do not have a well - defined structure . These characteristics often predispose the clot to rupture which can lead to devastating ischemia of the heart ( heart attack ) , brain ( stroke ) , or extremities ( gangrene ) ( Ross R 1993 and Ross R 1999 ) . Endothelial cells lining all blood vessels play an important role during systemic inflammation because of their position and immediate exposure to inflammatory mediators . The two major inflammatory mediators ( cytokines ) that are elevated during systemic inflammation are Interleukin - 1β ( IL - 1β ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNFα ) ( Kishikawa H , Shimokama T , and Watanabe T 1993 , Rus HG , Niculescu F , and Vlaicu R 1991 , Moyer CF et al . 1991 , and Galea J et al . 1996 ) . Studies have documented that endothelial cells respond to various external stimuli , in part by altering gene expression for cytokines , adhesion molecules , pro - coagulation factors , and other proteins ( Paleolog EM et al . 1994 , Dixit VM et al . 1990 , Ross R 1997 , and Ross R 1999 ) . Therefore , the response of endothelial cells to IL - 1β and TNFα treatment will likely provide necessary information that may help to explain some of the dysfunction that occurs ( Zhao B et al . 2003 ) . 8 As previously mentioned , one of the major hallmarks of atherosclerosis is the proliferation of VSMCs induced by inflammatory signaling . Therefore , a logical treatment for atherosclerosis would include a molecule or drug capable of attenuating VSMC proliferation and thereby inhibiting fibrous plaque development . The glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) heparin has those capabilities . It has been shown to elicit a cell cycle block in VSMCs at the G 1 phase ( Reilly CF et al . 1989 and Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) and has not been shown to trigger resistance in VSMCs ( Mrabat H et al . 2009 ) . Heparin is a naturally occurring complex carbohydrate which is well - known for its anti - coagulant properties , but has been widely studied for potential use in attenuating or reversing the atherogenic process ( Edelberg JM et al . 1991 and Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . The anti - proliferative effects of heparin in vivo and in vitro have been well - documented throughout the literature as well as from previous members of the Lowe - Krentz laboratory ( Clowes AW and Karnowsky MJ 1977 , Mrabat H et al . 2009 , Kazi M et al . 2002 , Savage JM et al . 2001 , and Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . Despite the wealth of information regarding the anti - proliferative effects of heparin on VSMCs in the literature , relatively little is known about the actual mechanism ( s ) of action for heparin . Evidence in the literature suggests that heparin exerts its anti - proliferative effects via at least two mechanisms . One mechanism includes the regulation of Mitogen - Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) cascade intermediates ( Yu L et al . 2006 , Blaukovitch CI et al . 2012 , Dickinson RJ and Keyse SM 2006 , Pukac LA et al . 1997 , and Dhillon AS et al . 2007 ) , which are involved in cell growth and proliferation and by imposing a cell cycle block at the G 1 phase through upregulation or down regulation of specific genes 9 necessary for the transition from the G 1 to the S phase ( Reilly CF et al . 1989 , Fasciano S et al . 2005 , Vadivello PK et al . 1997 , Mishra - Gorur K and Castellot JJ 1999 , Ottlinger ME , Pukac LA , and Karnovsky MJ 1993 , and Pukac LA et al . 1997 ) . Previous work in the lab and work done within this dissertation have built the case that heparin binding to a putative heparin receptor induced the synthesis of cGMP ( cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate ) , leading to PKG ( cGMP - dependent protein kinase ) activation , and MKP - 1 ( MAPK phosphatase - 1 ) upregulation ( Figure 1 . 3 ) ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2012 ) . MKP - 1 localizes to the nucleus , functions as a dual - specificity phosphatase ( DUSP ) , and removes both activating phosphorylations from ERK , thereby inactivating ERK ( Rohan PJ et al . 1993 ) . Sustained activation of ERK results in Elk - 1 phorphorylation in the nucleus ( Shin HS et al . 2003 ) . This MKP - 1 - mediated loss of active ERK in the nucleus results in decreased Elk - 1 activity as well ( Shin HS et al . 2003 ) . MKP - 1 new protein synthesis as a result of heparin treatment can be seen as early as 10 min ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . Figure 1 . 3 : Heparin’s effect on the MAPK pathway in VSMCs ( Adapted from Pugh R . Dissertation Lecture 2010 ) 10 The case for PKG involvement in heparin - induced MKP - 1 mediated dephosphorylation of ERK draws parallels from insulin and insulin - related growth factor ( IGF ) signaling . Both insulin and IGF induce the expression of inducible nitrous oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , leading to increased cGMP in response to NO - activated soluble guanylyl cyclase ( sGC ) ( Begum N et al . 1998 and Jacob A et al . 2002 ) . This increase in cGMP was shown to be sufficient to induce MKP - 1 and decrease ERK activity . Atrial natriuretic factor or peptide ( ANF or ANP ) has also been show to elevate cGMP levels in VSMCs ( Baldini PM et al . 2002 and Tantini B et al . 2005 ) . ANP activates intracellular guanylyl cyclase and thereby elevates cGMP ( Baldini PM et al . 2002 and Tantini B et al . 2005 ) . Aside from their known roles in vasorelaxation , ANP and cGMP have been shown to decrease VSMC proliferation ( Baldini PM et al . 2002 ) ; building the possibility that heparin’s effects could be mediated by cGMP and PKG signaling . Aside from inducing MKP - 1 protein synthesis , heparin also down - regulates Raf activity . Since Raf is an upstream kinase of ERK , decreased Raf activity leads to decreased ERK activity ( Pukac LA et al . 1997 and Slee JB , Pugh R , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) ( Figure 1 . 3 ) . Since Raf activity is down - regulated in response to heparin treatment , it is clear that down - regulation of ERK activity would follow . It has been shown in the literature that heparin treatment causes a rapid downregulation of mRNA levels of genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation , including c - fos , c - jun , myb , and myc , again decreasing proliferation ( Mishra - Gorur K and Castellot JJ 1999 ) . It was established in the mid - nineties that endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) interacts with caveolin , the structural component of caveolae ( reviewed in : Rath 11 G , Dessy C , and Feron O 2009 ) . Caveolae are flask - like invaginations of membranes which occur at different densities in most cell types and are prominent in vascular endothelial cells , adipocytes , fibroblasts , and epithelial cells ( reviewd in : Childow JG Jr and Sessa WC 2010 ) , where they form stable membrane domains often referred to as lipid rafts . Caveolae have also been shown to regulate vesicle transport by serving as carriers in exocytic and endocytic pathways ( Parton RG and Simons K 2007 and Childow JG Jr and Sessa WC 2010 ) . Caveolins ( 1 , 2 , and 3 ) have cytoplasmic N - and C - termini , sites for post translational modifications , and a scaffolding domain , all of which are involved in forming an organized hub for signal transduction ( reviewed in : Patel HH , Murray F , and Insel PA 2008 ) . Caveolins have been shown to group together upstream signaling components ( including G - protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases ) and downstream components ( including G - protein coupled receptor subunits , effector enzymes , and ion channels ) to centralize and enhance signal processing and transduction . Caveolin - 1 ( cav - 1 ) is of particular importance in the vasculature , predominantly vascular endothelial cells , due to its regulation of eNOS within caveolae . Endothelial cav - 1 is involved in caveloae formation throughout the endothelium of the entire vascular system where it regulates endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) production , vascular permeability , and vascular remodeling ( Parton RG and Simons K 2007 , Childow JG Jr and Sessa WC 2010 , and Patel HH , Murray F , and Insel PA 2008 ) . The second way in which heparin exerts its anti - proliferative affects in VSMCs is by imposing a cell cycle block at the G 1 phase ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 , Vadivello PK et al . 1997 , Reilly CF et al . 1989 , Mishra - Gorur K and Castellot JJ 1999 , Ottlinger ME 12 1993 , and Pukac LA et al . 1997 ) . Cellular proliferation is regulated primarily by control of the cell cycle , which consists of four distinct sequential phases ( G 0 / G 1 , S , G 2 , and M ) . Most smooth muscle cells in the adult vascular system are in a quiescent state , typically arrested in the G 0 or G 1 phases of the cell cycle . Research has shown that heparin strongly down - regulates the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein , cdk2 mRNA , and cdc2 protein leading to cell cycle block at the G 1 phase ( Vadivello PK et al . 1997 ) . One cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor ( CDKI ) upregulated by heparin treatment is p27 kip1 . This stable accumulated p27 kip1 protein level in G 1 is essential for the heparin - induced decreases in VSMC proliferation because p27 kip1 prevents the activation of cyclin - dependent kinase 2 ( Cdk2 ) ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . It has also been shown by other groups that p27 kip1 is upregulated in response to heparin treatment , again blocking cellular proliferation at G 1 ( Yu L et al . 2006 and Fouty BW et al . 2001 ) . It is also suggested in the literature that heparin blocks progression through G 1 by inhibition of the PKC - dependent pathway of cell cycle progression ( Pukac LA et al . 1990 ) . This PKC inhibition results in the blocking of second messengers required for fos expression ( Pukac LA et al . 1992 ) and decreased ERK activation ( Mishra - Gorur K and Castellot JJ 1999 , Ottlinger ME et al . 1993 , and Pukac LA et al 1997 ) . It is becoming clearer in the literature that heparin and low ( or non - ) anticoagulant heparin derivatives exhibit strong anti - inflammatory properties . These anti - inflammatory properties could be harnessed to improve the treatment of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and graft arteriosclerosis which can be caused by excessive inflammation and innate and adaptive immune responses ( Hansson GK et al . 2002 ) . Heparin and low 13 anticoagulant heparin have been shown to inhibit inflammation by disrupting multiple levels of the inflammatory cascade ( Thourani VH et al . 2000 ) . Heparin treatment inhibits complement activation in vivo ( Weiler JM et al . 1992 ) , adhesion molecules P - and L - selectin binding to thrombin - activated human lung microvascular endothelial cells ( Wang L et al . 2001 ) , Polymorphonuclear ( PMN ) elastase and cathepsin G activities in vitro and in vivo ( Fryer A et al . 1997 ) , and nuclear factor κB ( NFκB ) nuclear translocation ( Thourani VH et al . 2000 ) . Additionally , heparin treatment inhibits interferon - γ ( IFN - γ ) responses , competes for binding with IP - 10 , I - TAC , and Mig on endothelial cells , and prevents transendothelial migration and arterial recruitment of memory T cells ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ) . The NFκB pathway is involved in a variety of cellular processes including immune responses , cell survival , stress responses , and is mis - regulated in chronic inflammation and other diseases ( reviewed in : Shih VF et al . 2011 ) . In non - stimulated cells , NFκB is bound in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor , IκB , preventing nuclear translocation and DNA binding . In response to specific stimuli , IκB kinase phosphorylates IκB resulting in IκB degradation and NFκB release and activation . Active NFκB migrates to the nucleus , binds DNA and induces the transcription of pro - inflammatory genes ( Shih VF et al . 2011 ) , such as TNFα , propagating the inflammatory response ( reviewed in : Thourani VH et al . 2000 ) . It has also been documented that inhibiting NFκB reduces level of circulating TNFα ( Cain BS et al . 1999 ) . Heparin has been reported to block this pathway in at least two ways . First , heparin treatment of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) prevents NFκB nuclear 14 translocation and heparin inclusion in DNA binding assays inhibited NFκB binding to DNA ( Thourani VH et al . 2000 ) . If this anti - inflammatory mechanism is true , it would require heparin to be released in the cytoplasm , something for which a mechanism has yet to be elucidated . Heparin also decreases the activity of NFκB by inhibiting the interaction of RAGE ( Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products ) with its ligands AGEs ( Advanced Glycation End Products ) . The RAGE system is one mechanism known to elicit pro - inflammatory cascades in vascular endothelium and smooth muscle ( Basta G et al . 2002 , Goldin A et al . 2006 , and Lander HM et al . 1997 ) . Rao NV et al . ( 2010 ) reported that both heparin and low anti - coagulant 2 - O , 3 - O - desulfated heparin ( ODSH ) prevented inflammatory cells from utilizing RAGE as a vascular adhesion molecule . The overall importance of their work is that heparin and ODSH can disrupt several steps in leukocyte - mediated inflammation . However , the role of RAGE in heparin signaling was outside the scope of this dissertation . It has been well established in the literature that many cells , including cells of the vasculature , such as endothelial and smooth muscle , bind and internalize heparin via receptor - mediated endocytosis shown using radiolabeled or fluorescent heparin ( eg . Bârzu T et al . 1985 and Castellot JJ et al . 1985 ) . Thourani VH et al . ( 2000 ) reported that pre - treatment of HUVECs with 200 µg / ml heparin or OSDH inhibited TNFα - induced translocation of NFκB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus . The authors employed immunohistochemistry for p65 nuclear staining and in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays showing that heparins reduce NFκB - DNA binding . The explanation given by Thourani VH et al . , suggests that heparin is bound and internalized by vascular 15 endothelium and smooth muscle ( Bârzu T et al . 1985 and Castellot JJ et al . 1985 ) , allowing the negatively charged heparin molecule to bind to the positively charged nuclear localization sequence of NFκB thereby blocking its association with the nuclear pore complex ( Thourani VH et al . 2000 ) . Although Thourani VH et al . postulated this mechanism , they did not address how heparin was internalized or how it was released into the cytoplasm and did not rule out possible heparin - receptor binding and signaling . Other work performed by Penc SF et al . ( 1999 ) found that the GAG dermatan sulfate , which possesses different sugars and sulfate locations , actually induced the activation of NFκB and its downstream responses in cultured human dermal microvascular endothelium , but the authors were unable to confirm whether this was due to a direct or indirect response . These results suggest that that different GAGs can mediate different responses based on their differing chemistries ( Lindahl U et al . 1998 ) ; although it is supported that exogenous heparin mediates similar responses to certain heparan sulfates given their similar chemistries ( Gitay - Goren H et al . 1992 , Spivak - Kroizman T et al . 1994 , Ono K et al . 1999 , and Mamluk R et al . 2002 ) . Both heparin and ODSH block the adhesion of P - selectin to P - selectin glycoprotein ligand - 1 expressing U937 cells and disrupt leukocyte arrest by Mac - 1 / RAGE inhibition ( Rao NV et al . 2010 ) . Again , both heparin and ODSH were shown to inhibit Mac - 1 - mediated binding of AMJ2 - C11 mouse alveolar macrophages , to immobilized RAGE , and both prevented U937 cells from binding to RAGE . They were also able to show that heparin and ODSH disrupt diapedesis through the inhibition of the binding of azurocidin to heparin - BSA - coated wells . Lastly , their work indicated that 16 heparin and ODSH disrupted the secretion of pro - inflammatory granular contents . Heparin and ODSH inhibited Human Leukocyte Elastase and cathepsin G enzyme activity with synthetic chromogenic substrates . It was also determined that both blocked RAGE from binding to S100 calgranulins , which are also secreted by leukocytes ( Rao NV et al . 2010 ) . The Rao study not only strengthens our understanding of the anti - inflammatory aspects of heparin , it also provides evidence that the anti - coagulant functions of heparin can be removed , specifically , by 2 - O and 3 - O desulfation , while the important anti - inflammatory capabilities are retained ( Rao NV et al . 2010 ) . A model that is well - established and well - supported in the literature is that heparin can compete for binding with pro - inflammatory molecules and thus exert its anti - inflammatory effects ( Ali S et al . 2003 , Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 , and Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 ) . This model is supported by evidence that heparin or heparin - like molecules bind various growth factors , cytokines , and chemokines including fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) ( Mongiat M et al . 2000 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) ( Gitay - Goren H et al . 1992 ) , interleukins 1 - 8 ( Ramsden L and Rider CC 1992 , Roberts R et al . 1988 , Lortat - Jacob H et al . 1997 , Clarke D et al . 1995 , and Webb LM et al . 1993 ) , and interferon - gamma ( IFN - γ ) ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 and Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 ) . The last of which , IFN - γ , has received much attention due to the discovery that heparin can inhibit certain IFN - γ - inducible cytokine profiles ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 and Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 ) . These findings are intriguing , because of the role of IFN - γ as a pro - inflammatory cytokine , and because analyses of atherosclerotic lesions in clinical specimens indicate that they possess T - cell infiltrate with IFN - γ - secreting cytokine 17 profiles and up - regulated IFN - γ - inducible molecules ( Frostegård J et al . 1999 , van Besouw NM et al . 1997 , and Mach F et al . 1999 ) . These findings suggest that in vascular disease there is an aberrant up - regulation of the IFN - γ responses which could be therapeutically attenuated with heparin or heparin - like molecules . The IFN - γ response is initiated by CD4 + helper T cells ( Th ) or CD8 + cytotoxic T cells ( Tc ) which produce IFN - γ , whose maturity is regulated by IL - 12 and promoted by IL - 18 ( Salgame P et al . 1991 ) . IFN - γ strongly induces IFN - γ - inducible protein of 10 kDa ( IP - 10 ) / CXCL10 , IFN - inducible T cell α chemoattractant ( I - TAC ) / CXCL11 , and monokine induced by IFN - γ ( Mig ) / CXCL9 ( Bonecchi R et al . 1998 ) in vascular cells which are important for T cell behavior ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ) . It has been determined that heparin is a competitive inhibitor of ligands , including IP - 10 , I - TAC , and Mig , for the IFN - γ receptor . Clinical doses ( 3 mg / kg ) of heparin increase plasma levels of all three in patients with coronary atherosclerosis undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ) . Exposing EDTA - mobilized HUVECs pre - incubated with IP - 10 to heparin resulted in an increase in IP - 10 in the supernatant . This suggests a competitive binding model in which heparin displaces bound IP - 10 from HUVECs ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ) . Control experiments with trypsin did not result in the release of IP - 10 , further suggesting the release of surface - bound IP - 10 ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ) . The Ranjbaran study also indicated that at relatively high doses , heparin may inhibit the production of these chemokines in atherosclerotic coronary arteries of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ) . Corresponding to the lack of receptor bound IP - 10 ; heparin was also able to inhibit IP - 10 - 18 dependent transendothelial migration of T cells ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ) . A related study performed by Hatakeyama M et al . in 2004 suggested that heparin can inhibit INF - γ - induced fractalkine ( CX3CL1 ) expression in HUVECs , preventing chemoattraction of mononuclear cells and their eventual adhesion . Using ELISA binding assays , the authors determined that heparin decreased the amount of IFN - γ bound to wells coated with IFN - γ Receptor 1 ( Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 ) . Western blotting using native gels showed that pre - incubation of HUVECs with heparin resulted in a shift in the molecular weight of IFN - γ , suggesting that heparin can bind directly to IFN - γ ( Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 ) . The results of these assays indicate a plausible mechanism in which heparin binds IFN - γ and blocks it from binding to its receptor ( Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 ) . The authors also concluded from Western blot data that heparin was capable of inhibiting the IFN - γ - induced phosphorylation of STAT - 1 ( Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 ) . These two articles suggest that the IFN - γ arm of the inflammatory pathway may be a preferential target of heparin . The anti - inflammatory effects of heparin are summarized in Table 1 . 1 . Table 1 . 1 : The anti - inflammatory effects of heparin ( Adapted from Slee JB , Pugh R , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) Exogenous Heparin Complement System Inhibition of complement activation ( Weiler JM et al . 1992 ) Leukocyte Tethering and Rolling Inhibition of P - and L - Selectin ( Wang L et al . 2001 ) NFκB Signaling Inhibition of NFκB nuclear translocation ( Thourani VH et al . 2000 ) Inhibition of AGE - RAGE binding ( Rao NV et al . 2010 ) IFN - γ Responses Competitive inhibition of IP - 10 , I - TAC , and Mig for the IFN - γ receptor ( Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ) Inhibition of STAT - 1 phosphorylation ( Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 ) 19 The anti - inflammatory mechanisms of heparin and heparan sulfates discussed herein only represent a small subset of the known anti - inflammatory capabilities of this class of molecules . Ongoing research suggests that heparin can be experimentally modified to reduce the anti - coagulant properties while maintaining the anti - inflammatory properties . In addition , it has been shown that heparin treatment induces endothelial cells to produce additional heparan sulfates ( Morrison P and Lowe - Krentz LJ 1989 ) , suggesting that triggering this pathway , even without heparin as the signal , could increase the anti - inflammatory nature of the vasculature . It is likely that our understanding of the anti - inflammatory properties of heparin and heparan sulfates is still in its infancy . Since it has been established that heparin can be internalized by cells of the vasculature ( Bârzu T et al . 1985 and Castellot JJ et al . 1985 ) , one can speculate that many of the anti - inflammatory behaviors of heparin could be receptor - mediated . Heparin internalization suggests receptor involvement , supporting the possibility of receptor - based signaling , which has yet to be identified in the literature . It has been widely documented in the literature and by previous members of the Lowe - Krentz laboratory that heparin mediates a portion of its effects through a cell surface receptor , suggesting that a putative heparin receptor exists on the surface of VSMCs ( Savage JM et al . 2001 ) and vascular endothelial cells ( Patton WA et al . 1995 ) . It has also been documented by previous members of the Lowe - Krentz lab that treatment with monoclonal antibodies that block heparin binding to endothelial cells also mimics the effects of heparin in vascular smooth muscle cells ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 and Savage JM et al . 2001 ) and vascular endothelial cells ( Patton WA et al . 1995 ) . Although 20 it is well - documented that the heparin receptor exists , there has not been published evidence reporting the isolation and characterization of the receptor . Due to this fact , there is not much known about the receptor itself . However , given the highly charged nature of heparin chains , the most likely mechanism for transport across the membrane would be through a receptor . Therefore our lab set out to identify a receptor for heparin . Along with heparin as an anti - inflammatory agent , shear stress plays an important role in maintaining vascular homeostasis . The hypothesis that shear stress was a causative agent in atherosclerosis was originally proposed in the late 1960s ( reviewed in Caro CG , Fitz - Gerald JM , and Schroter RC 1969 ) . Atheroprotective conditions are found in regions of the vasculature where blood flow is continuous and undisturbed ( laminar ) , which can be mimicked in a laboratory setting using 15 dynes / cm 2 shear stress ( high fluid shear stress – FSS ) ( Birukov KG et al . 2002 , Dewey C et al . 1981 , Mott RE and Helmke BP 2007 ) . Atheroprone regions of the vascular system occur in areas of turbulent blood flow ( i . e . artery bifurcations ) , which can be mimicked in the lab using 4 dynes / cm 2 shear stress ( low FSS ) ( Siasos G et al . 2007 and Kadohama H et al . 2006 ) ( Figures 1 . 2 and 1 . 4 ) . Figure 1 . 4 : The relationship between FSS and atherosclerosis In vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that laminar shear stress causes endothelial cell , nuclei , and actin microfilament alignment in the direction of FSS ( Birukov KG et al . 2002 , Dewey C et al . 1981 , Mott RE and Helmke BP 2007 , and Mengistu M et al . 2011 ) . It has been well - documented in the Lowe - Krentz lab and in the literature that under high 21 FSS ( 15 dynes / cm 2 ) , endothelial cells undergo a series of morphological changes , culminating in the alignment of the whole cell , actin microfilaments , microtubules , and intermediate filaments in the direction of FSS ( Figure 1 . 5 ) ( Flitney FW et al . 1996 , Franke R et al . 1984 , Galbraith CG , Shalak R , Chien S 1998 , Helmke BP et al . 2001 , Malek AM and Izumo S 1996 , Sato M , Levesque M , and Nerem R 1987 , Wechezak A , Viggers R , and Sauvage L 1985 , Mengistu M et al . 2011 , and Azuma N et al . 2001 ) , but the molecular mechanisms underlying this remodeling are unclear . As shown in Figure 1 . 5 , at approximately 5 to 15 min , an upregulation in actin microfilaments is seen in response to high FSS , which has been termed Phase 1 . The formation of stress fibers can be seen as early as 5 min of high FSS . Stress fibers are actomyosin bundles composed of 10 - 30 actin filaments held together by cross - linking proteins such as alpha - actinin and filamin , and non - muscle myosin and tropomyosin ( Cramer L , Siebert M , and Mitchinson T 1997 , Lazarides E and Burridge K 1975 , Wang K , Ash J , and Singer S 1975 , Weber K and Groeschel - Steward U 1974 ) . Stress fiber formation is a conserved adaptation of eukaryotic cells , but its assembly is not well understood . Phase 2 is marked by the formation of a dense cortical actin band around 30 min of high FSS . This dense contractile endothelial actin ring not only helps maintain cell - cell junctions , but also gives these cells the capability to contract and regulate the permeability of the endothelium ( Schnittler H 1998 and Schnittler H et al . 2001 ) . Lastly , Phase 3 is marked by the alignment of the whole cell and actin microfilaments in the direction of shear stress at time points greater than 60 minutes of high FSS ( Mengistu M et al . 2011 and reviewed in Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . The 22 alignment in the direction of FSS allows ECs to reduce their height in order to decrease the magnitude of the strain they experience from hemodynamic forces ( Barbee K , Davies P , and Lal R 1994 , Hu S et al . 2003 , Karcher H 2003 , Pellegrin S and Mellor H 2007 ) . Figure 1 . 5 : The three phases of actin microfilament rearrangement in response to high fluid shear stress ( Adapted from Mengistu M et al . 2011 and Mengistu M , Slee JB , Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) Several mechanisms have been proposed for sensing , transducing , and responding to FSS . The cytoskeleton has been shown to be responsible for the transmission of stresses from the cell surface to various intracellular locations such as cell - cell adhesion sites , focal adhesion sites , and the nucleus ( reviewed in : Barakat A and Davies P 1998 ) . It has also been suggested that a mechanosensing complex is found in endothelial cells to elicit mechanical signals to the actin cytoskeleton , which is discussed further in Chapter 3 ( Conway D and Schwartz MA 2012 ) . A role for cell - cell junctions in this process is also emerging and plays a large role in the mechanosensing complex ( Tzima E et al . 2005 ) . Although much is known about responses to FSS in vascular endothelium , a detailed mechanism has yet to be determined . Regulation of actin microfilament dynamics depends in part upon the Actin Depolymerizing Factor ( ADF ) family of proteins , of which cofilin is a prominent player ( reviewed in : Lin M - C et al . 2010 , Suurna MV et al . 2006 , Chen Q and Pollard TD 2013 , and Nishida E et al . 1987 ) . It is well - documented that phospho - cofilin is 23 dephosphorylated by cofilin phosphatases , including chronophin and the slingshot ( SSH ) family of protein phosphatases and therefore activated by various external stimuli ( Suurna MV et al . 2006 , Won KJ et al . 2008 , Keezer SM et al . 2003 , and Cote M et al . 2010 ) . Once dephosphorylated , cofilin is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics ( Suurna MV et al . 2006 , Won KJ et al . 2008 , Keezer SM et al . 2003 , and Cote M et al . 2010 ) . To inactivate cofilin various extracellular signals trigger its phosphorylation via the Lin - 11 / Isl - 1 / Mec - 3 domain - containing protein kinase ( LIM Kinase ) family ( reviewed in : Bernard O 2007 , Moriyama K , Iida K , and Yahara I 1996 ) or by the related testicular protein kinase ( TESK ) ( Suurna MV et al . 2006 , Won KJ et al . 2008 , Keezer SM et al . 2003 , and Cote M et al . 2010 ) , inducing the inhibition of actin dynamics leading to actin stress fiber accumulation ( Suurna MV et al . 2006 , Won KJ et al . 2008 , Keezer SM et al . 2003 , and Cote M et al . 2010 ) . As shown in Figure 1 . 6 , cofilin regulation is opposite of traditional phosphorylation control mechanisms , in that phosphorylation of cofilin is required to , in essence , inactivate the protein , inducing the inhibition of actin dynamics ( Suurna MV et al . 2006 , Won KJ et al . 2008 , Keezer SM et al . 2003 , and Cote M et al . 2010 ) . Figure 1 . 6 : Regulation of cofilin 24 Published evidence indicates that c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) and p38 , both members of sub - groups of the larger MAPK family , associate with actin microfilaments and mediate shear stress - induced endothelial cell and actin filament realignment ( Azuma N et al . 2001 , Hamel M et al . 2006 , Wang J et al . 2005 , and Mengistu M et al . 2011 ) . MAPKs are a ubiquitous group of serine / threonine kinases which play a role in transmitting extracellular signals required for various cellular functions . All MAPKs are activated by specific kinases ( MAPKKs ) that phosphorylate a threonine and tyrosine residue in a conserved TEY ( Threonine - Glutamic Acid - Tyrosine ) motif for ERKs , TPY ( Threonine - Proline - Tyrosine ) motif for stress - activated protein kinases ( SAPKs ) / JNKs , and TGY ( Threonine - Glycine - Tyrosine ) motif for p38 ( Nishida E and Gotoh Y 1993 , Ruderman JV 1993 , Seger R and Krebs EG 1995 , Cano E and Mahadevan LC 1995 , Davis RJ 1994 , and Kyriakis JM et al . 1994 ) . The MAPKs are a family of protein kinases involved in of three pathways which are defined as follows . First , the “classical” MAPKs or extracellular signal regulated kinases ( ERKs ) is involved in proliferation and differentiation ( Nishida E and Gotoh Y 1993 , Ruderman JV 1993 , Seger R and Krebs EG 1995 , Cano E and Mahadevan LC 1995 , Davis RJ 1994 , and Kyriakis JM et al . 1994 ) . The second pathway is the JNK or stress - activated protein kinases ( SAPK ) which is involved in inflammation and stress - induced signaling ( reviewed in : Kyriakis JM et al . 1994 ) . Lastly the p38 pathway was originally thought to be involved mainly in cellular signaling in response to osmotic shock . But it is becoming clear that this pathway is involved in much more than previously thought ( reviewed in : Zarubin T and Han J 2005 , Daum G et al . 1997 , and 25 Thornton TM and Rincon M et al . 2009 ) . A recent review article highlights evidence in the literature suggesting that p38 MAPK is involved in the regulation of the G 1 - S and G 2 - M phase transitions of the cell cycle ( reviewed in : Thornton TM and Rincon M 2009 ) . The work collected within this dissertation advances our understanding of the anti - inflammatory capabilities of heparin and shear stress in the vasculature . The heparin signaling cascade , heparin - induced gene expression changes , and the relationship between FSS and actin realignment in vascular endothelium were investigated . It was shown that TMEM184A is a cell surface receptor for heparin and that TMEM184A is involved in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction , fitting with it being a receptor for heparin . It was determined that heparin signaling involves cGMP and PKG ; presenting the possibility that heparin signaling depends on eNOS ( endothelial nitric oxide synthase ) which also co - localizes with TMEM184A . An anti - inflammatory quality of heparin was determined by showing that it attenuates stress responses induced by TNFα as assayed by stress fiber induction and nuclear stress kinase ( pJNK and pp38 ) activity in sub - confluent vascular endothelial cells . Along with investigating the anti - inflammatory qualities of heparin , microarray data reveal that heparin regulates a large number of genes in vascular smooth muscle cells , which cluster in groups related to integrin interactions , receptor signaling , proteoglycans , and proteolysis pathways to highlight a few . Lastly , the anti - inflammatory nature of shear stress involves cofilin which is required for FSS - induced actin realignment and barrier integrity , emphasizing the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in the atheroprotective regions of the vasculature . 26 Chapter 2 : General Methods 27 2 . 1 : Cell Culture Bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAOECs ) were obtained from Cell Applications ( San Diego , CA ) and cultured using Cell Applications BAOEC media according to their recommendations or gradually exchanged to supplemented MEM media ( described below ) for large volume experiments . Briefly , BAOECs were initially cultured in Cell Applications media for 2 - 3 passages , after which supplemented MEM media was blended in each passage until the Cell Applications media was completely removed . This was typically performed over 2 - 3 passages . A7r5s ( rat aortic smooth muscle cells ) obtained from ATTC , Manassas , VA , primary rat aortic smooth muscles cells ( RAOSMCs ) and primary bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAOSMCs ) obtained from Cell Applications , San Diego , CA were cultured according to the manufacturer’s recommended instructions using minimum essential eagle’s medium ( MEM ) ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) supplemented with pre - tested 10 % heat inactivated fetal bovine serum ( hiFBS ) ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY or Biowest , Miami , FL ) , 5 % L - glutamine ( Sigma ) , 1 % sodium pyruvate ( Sigma , # S8636 ) , 1 % minimum non - essential amino acids ( Sigma , # M7145 ) , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin antibiotics ( Sigma , # P0781 ) . Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells obtained from Dr . Bryan Berger and Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast ( MEF ) cells obtained from Dr . Matthias Falk were cultured using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media ( DMEM ) supplemented identical to the MEM media . Madin - Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial ( MDCK ) cells obtained from Dr . Anastasia Thevenin / Dr . Matthias Falk were cultured in low glucose DMEM supplemented ( Sigma ) with 10 % hiFBS , 5 % L - glutamine , and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin antibiotics . Cells were cultured at 37 ºC and 28 5 % CO 2 with humidity . Culture plates were pre - treated with 0 . 2 % porcine gelatin for 1 hr prior to cell seeding . Typically , vascular cells were between passages 5 and 20 for experiments , except A7r5s , CHOs , and MDCKs which are cloned lines and last much longer in cell culture . 2 . 2 : Immunofluorescence Staining For cofilin staining and select TMEM184A staining , cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , fixed , and permeabilized with ice - cold methanol for 5 min at - 20 ºC and washed again with PBS . The cover slips were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 ºC . Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC / AlexaFluor488® or TRITC ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , West Grove , PA ) overnight at 4 ºC . In all other experiments , cells were fixed with 2 . 0 % formaldehyde ( Sigma ) or 4 . 0 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma ) for 15 min at room temperature with shaking and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % or 0 . 3 % Triton - X - 100 ( Sigma ) for 5 min at room temperature with shaking . Coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 ºC and secondary antibodies for 2 hr at room temperature . Both primary and secondary antibodies were used at dilutions recommended by the suppliers . Cover slips were mounted in mowoil ( Calbiochem , Darmstadt , Germany ) to minimize photobleaching . 2 . 3 : SDS - Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and Western Blotting 100 mm plates of cultured cells were harvested with SDS sample buffer as previously described ( Hamel M et al . 2006 ) . Proteins were resolved by SDS - PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose and blots were probed with primary 29 antibodies specific for the protein of interest and secondary antibodies conjugated to biotin ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Blots were developed using ExtraAvidin™ alkaline phosphatase , BCIP , and NBT ( Sigma ) . Bands of interested were identified by comparison with lanes using only secondary antibodies and by molecular weight based on migration of pre - stained Rainbow™ molecular weight markers ( GE Healthcare Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) . R f values for the molecular weight markers were used to generate a standard curve which was used to calculate the molecular weight of the bands of interest . Acylamide solutions were obtained from Amresco ( Solon , OH ) . For select TMEM184A work , blots were developed using ECL reagents for enhanced clarity . Briefly , membranes were washed 3X with TBST following biotin - conjugated secondary antibody incubation and placed into pre - mixed ABC ( Avidin - Biotin Complex , Thermo Scientific ) reagent for 30 min with shaking at room temperature . Following ABC reagent incubation , membranes were washed 3X with TBST . In the dark room , membranes were incubated with pre - mixed ECL ( Enhanced Chemiluminenscence , Thermo Scientific ) reagent for 3 min , followed by film exposure . Film exposures varied from 1 – 15 min depending on signal intensity . Once film was exposed it was developed manually using Kodak D - 76 Film Developer and fixed with Sprint Record Speed Fixer ( Dan’s Camera City , Allentown , PA ) . Development time averaged around 5 min , but varied with signal intensity . Once developed , films were fixed for 1 min . ABC and ECL reagents were used at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer . 30 2 . 4 : Confocal Microscopy Fluorescent labels were visualized using the Zeiss© LSM 510 Meta with a 63X oil - immersion lens at room temperature . All images were taken at approximately the same Z - plane of the cell where intensity was the greatest . Gain intensity was set just below saturating levels for the control [ or static ( and no inhibitor in some cases ) for cofilin experiments ] slide and those settings were used to image the remaining slides within a replicate for each protein of interest . The images shown are representative of the mean integrated fluorescence density for the protein indicated at each time point tested . 2 . 5 : Fluorescent Microscopy Fluorescent microscopy was used to obtain whole cell levels of various proteins . Fluorescent labels were visualized using a Nikon eclipse TE 2000 - U fluorescence microscope with a 60X oil - immersion lens ( Nikon , Tokyo Japan ) at room temperature . Micrographs were captured with a SPOT RT KE camera . All images were taken at the same gain intensity and exposure time to allow for comparison across images . Gain intensity and exposure time were set just below saturating levels for the control slide and those settings were used to image the remaining slides in a replicate . 2 . 6 : DNA Plasmid Sub - Cloning To propagate DNA plasmids ( GFP - vinculin ( Kenneth Yamada , National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research , Bethesda , MD ) , cofilin mutant constructs ( Theo Rein , Max Plank Institute of Psychiatry , Munich , Germany ) , TMEM184A shRNA constructs , and GFP - tagged TMEM184A ( OriGene , Rockville , MD ) standard microbiology techniques and Qiagen QIAprep mini - prep kits ( Cat . No . 27104 ) ( Valencia , 31 CA ) were used . LB broth ( Lennox ) and LB agar ( Lennox ) ( Difco Labs , Detroit , MI ) were prepared by adding 25 g or 40 g ( respectively ) to 1 L of Millipore water and autoclaved for 30 min . Once autoclaved , solutions were allowed to cool to room temperature and 100 µg / ml antibiotic was added ( typically kanamycin or ampicillin ( Sigma ) depending on the resistance gene on the plasmid ) . Plates were poured and once solidified were placed in the refrigerator . LB broth was kept in the refrigerator until needed . The JM109 ( Promega , Madison , WI ) E . coli strain was used to propagate most plasmids , and the DH5α ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) E . coli strain was used to propagate GFP - Tagged TMEM184A and TMEM184A shRNA constructs . E . coli were transformed with ~ 50 ng of plasmid using the following protocol . Briefly , 100 µl of JM109s / DH5αs were mixed with 50 ng of plasmid and incubated on ice for 10 min and were then heat shocked at 42 ºC for 2 min . Following heat shock , they were placed on ice and 500 µl of LB ( no antibiotic ) was added . The mixture was then incubated at 37 ºC for 1 hr with shaking . Bacteria were then spun down for 15 min to pellet and the pellet was re - suspended with the liquid in the tube . 100 µl of transformed bacteria solution was added to 1 LB + antibiotic plate . Each transformation yields 5 plates . Plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then flipped upside down and placed in an incubator overnight at 37 ºC . After overnight incubation , 1 colony was placed into a tube containing 5 ml of LB broth + antibiotic and incubated for ~ 16 hr at 37 ºC with shaking . After the 16 hour incubation , Qiagen’s miniprep plasmid isolation protocol was followed . Briefly , the bacteria were pelleted and supernatant removed . The pellet was re - suspended in 250 µl of 32 Buffer P1 and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube . 250 µl of Buffer P2 was then added and the tube was inverted 4 - 6 times to mix . 350 µl of Buffer N3 was added and the tube was mixed by inversion 4 - 6 times . Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 13 , 000 rpm . The supernantant was then applied to a QIAprep spin column and centrifuged for 1 min . Flow - through was discarded and the column was washed with 500 µl of Buffer PB and centrifuged for 1 min . Flow - through was discarded and 750 µl of Buffer PE was added and centrifuged for 1 min . Flow - through was discarded and centrifuged for an additional 1 min to remove any residual wash buffer . The QIAprep column was then placed in a clean 1 . 5 ml tube . DNA was eluted by adding 50 µl of Buffer EB directly to the center of the QIAprep spin column , and letting stand for 1 min . Tubes were centrifuged for 1 min to elute DNA . Nanodrop analysis was performed to obtain DNA concentration and purity based on A 260 / 280nm . A 260 / 280nm values of ~ 1 . 8 were considered suitable to further use . Purified plasmids were stored at - 20 ºC until needed . 2 . 7 : Heparin Preparation and Treatment In all experiments requiring heparin treatment , a 20 mg / ml stock was made fresh daily and diluted to 200 µg / ml in complete culture medium or starvation medium ( media without hiFBS ) . Throughout all experiments , heparin pretreatment was held constant at 20 min prior to other stimulation . Heparin from porcine skin was obtained from Sigma . 33 Chapter 3 : Actin realignment and cofilin regulation are essential for barrier integrity during shear stress 34 3 . 1 : Induction Fluid shear stress ( FSS ) plays important roles in embryonic morphogenesis of the vasculature , regulation of vessel diameter in adulthood , maintaining vascular homeostasis , and is implicated in the development of atherosclerosis ( reviewed in Hahn C and Schwartz MA 2009 ) . Vascular endothelial cells ( ECs ) respond to sustained laminar FSS by increasing their anti - thrombic activity , decreasing reactive oxygen species , increasing antioxidant enzymes , and altering growth factor signaling ( reviewed in Yamamoto K and Ando J 2011 ) . It has been estimated that more than 600 EC genes respond to FSS ( Ohura N et al . 2003 ) . FSS has been shown to activate a variety of signaling pathways in ECs , but it is still unclear how the cell initially senses this mechanical stress . The signaling pathways which have been shown to be activated by FSS include : ion channels leading to Ca 2 + influx , tyrosine kinase receptors leading to JNK activation , G - protein coupled receptors , and various adhesion proteins ( reviewed in Yamamoto K and Ando J 2011 ) . There have been recent advances in understanding the mechanotransduction induced by FSS , such as the importance of cell - cell junctions ( Tzima E et al . 2005 ) and involvement of the actin cytoskeleton ( Osborn EA et al . 2006 ) . It is becoming clear that at least one mechanosensing mechanism involves a complex of PECAM - 1 ( platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 ) , VE - cadherin ( vascular - endothelial cadherin ) , and VEGFR2 ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ) ( Figure 3 . 1 ) ( Conway D and Schwartz MA 2012 ) . Within this complex , PECAM - 1 and VEGFR2 are responsible for downstream signaling , while VE - cadherin functions as an adaptor ( Tzima E et al . 2005 ) . 35 VE - cadherin is an endothelial cell specific component of adherens junctions and is essential for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity ( Vincent PA et al . 2004 ) . The cytoplasmic domain of VE - cadherin associates with p120 - , β - , γ - , and α - catenin in endothelial cell - cell junctions to mediate downstream signaling ( Dejana E , Orsenigo F , and Lampugnani MG 2008 ) , with VE - cadherin connecting to the actin cytoskeleton via β - catenin ( Tharakan B et al . 2012 ) . Given the importance of the endothelial barrier for vascular permeability , it is imperative that the endothelial barrier remain intact during FSS . ECs exposed to FSS exhibit a marked increase in transendothelial resistance , illustrating a strengthening of the barrier compared to static cells ( DePaola N et al . 2001 , Seebach J et al . 2000 ) . Given that the VE - cadherin / β - catenin adhesions are linked to actin , we predicted that disruptions to the actin realignment process during FSS would disrupt endothelial barrier integrity . Figure 3 . 1 : Proposed mechanosensing complex ( Adapted from Conway D and Schwartz MA 2012 with established links to actin added ) In vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that laminar FSS ( 15dynes / cm 2 ) causes endothelial cell and actin microfilament alignment in the direction of FSS ( Mengistu M et 36 al . 2011 , Kadohama T et al . 2006 , Noria S et al . 2004 , Malek AM and Izumo S 1996 ) ( see Figure 3 . 2 ) , but the molecular mechanisms underlying this remodeling remain unclear . JNK and p38 are critically important during FSS - induced actin realignment . Studies investigating the role of JNK during FSS indicate that the JNK signaling pathway mediates , at least in part , FSS - induced actin realignment ( Mengistu M et al . 2011 , Hahn C et al . 2011 ) . It has also been demonstrated that p38 activity is required for complete FSS - induced actin remodeling ( Azuma N et al . 2001 and Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . There is a large amount of data detailing the roles of JNK and p38 in migrating cells during wound healing ( Reviewed in : Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) , as well as evidence for association with cytoskeletal structures in proliferating ECs ( Hamel M et al . 2006 ) . Regulation of actin microfilaments depends in part upon the Actin Depolymerizing Factor ( ADF ) / cofilin family of proteins , of which cofilin - 1 is the most prominent in non - muscle tissue ( Lin MC et al . 2010 , Suurna MV et al . 2006 , Berstein BW and Bambrug JR 2010 ) . The ADF / Cofilin proteins are expressed in all eukaryotes and can , for the most part , rescue deletions of other family members ( Berstein BW and Bambrug JR 2010 ) . However , cofilin - 1 cannot be rescued by other family members and knockout is embryonically lethal in mice ( Gurniak CB , Perlas E , and Witke W 2005 ) . One of the major regulatory mechanisms controlling cofilin ( from this point forward refers to cofilin - 1 ) activity is phosphorylation at serine - 3 ( Figure 3 . 2 ) ( reviewed in : Bernard O 2007 , Moriyama K , Iida K , and Yahara I 1996 , and Nagaoka R , Abe H , Obinata T 1996 ) . Phospho - cofilin ( serine - 3 ) ( p - cofilin ) is dephosphorylated by cofilin 37 phosphatases , including chronophin and the slingshot ( SSH ) family of protein phosphatases and therefore activated . Once dephosphorylated , cofilin binds to both G - actin and F - actin in a 1 : 1 molar ratio and promotes F - actin depolymerization ( Nishida E , Maekawa S , and Sakai H 1984 ) . Cofilin is inactivated by phosphorylation at serine - 3 via the Lin - 11 / Isl - 1 / Mec - 3 domain - containing protein kinase ( LIMK ) family , resulting in the formation of actin stress fibers ( Suurna MW et al . 2006 , Won KJ et al . 2008 , Keezer SM et al . 2003 , Côté MC et al . 2010 , and Bernard O 2007 ) . Figure 3 . 2 : Cofilin structure , with Serine - 3 phosphorylation site circled ( Bernstein BW & Bamburg JR 2010 ) It is becoming clear in the literature that actin is essential not only in the cytoplasm , but also in the nucleus , for regulation of transcription and gene expression ( Zheng B et al . 2009 and Pederson T 2008 ) . Actin alone is incapable of entering the nucleus , as it lacks a nuclear localization sequence , requiring it to associate with other proteins to facilitate nuclear entry . One of the leading hypotheses is that cofilin is responsible for localizing actin to the nucleus ( Berstein BW and Bamburg JR , 2010 , Mengistu M , Slee JB , Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . Cofilin has a nuclear localization sequence 38 ( KKRKK ) similar to that of SV40 large T antigen ( Iida K , Matsumoto S , and Yahara I 1992 and Karderon D et al . 1984 ) , and dephosphorylated cofilin has been reported to localize to the nucleus after various cell stresses , such as heat shock , latrunculin B treatment , or ATP depletion ( Pendleton A et al . 2003 and Iida K , Matsumoto S , and Yahara I 1992 ) . LIMK - 1 possesses two leucine - rich nuclear export signals within its PDZ domain and one NLS - like sequence responsible for nuclear localization ( Yang N and Mizuno K 1999 and Matsuzaki F et al . 1988 ) , suggesting that LIMK - 1 could phosphorylate cofilin in the nucleus . Definitive roles for cofilin in the nucleus have yet to be elucidated , but it has been predicted to facilitate nuclear actin depolymerization , as it does in the cytoplasm . In this study , we exposed vascular ECs to 15dynes / cm 2 FSS to determine the role of cofilin in FSS - induced actin realignment , further our understanding of the role of stress kinases in this process , and assess the effect of FSS - induced actin realignment on EC barrier integrity . The results indicate that FSS induces accumulation of p - cofilin in the nucleus , likely phosphorylated by pLIMK1 / 2 , whose activity in the nucleus is also responsive to FSS . Our results indicate that proper FSS - induced regulation of cofilin and actin are essential for FSS - induced realignment and barrier maintenance and enhancement .

Biochem . 114 : 782 – 795 , 2013 . 39 3 . 2 : Methods 3 . 2 . 1 : Cell Culture BAOECs were cultured onto 30 mm diameter , 0 . 17 mm thick glass cover slips coated with 30 µg / ml bovine collagen type I ( BD , San Jose , CA ) in phosphate - buffered saline , placed in six - well culture plates , and grown for approximately 18 hours until they formed a confluent monolayer . BAOECs were incubated for 1 hr in shear media ( MEM containing HEPES ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) , supplemented with 0 . 5 % heat - inactivated FBS ( Biowest , Miami , FL or Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) ) prior to shear exposure to maintain pH and to minimize bubble formation . The cover slips were assembled into a modified POC - mini - plate flow chamber ( Yalcin HC , Perry SF , and Ghadiali SN 2007 ) for exposure to FSS conditions . Typically , BAOECs between passages 5 and 20 were used for these experiments . 3 . 2 . 2 : JNK and p38 Inhibitor Treatments JNK activity was inhibited using SP600125 ( Calbiochem - EMD Millipore Chemicals , Billerica , MA ) , a competitive inhibitor for JNK ( Bogoyevitch MA et al . 2004 ) . p38 activity was inhibited using SB203580 ( Calbiochem ) which binds to the ATP - binding pocket inhibiting its catalytic activity , but not p38 phosphorylation ( Kumar S et al . , 1999 ) . BAOECs were cultured as described above and were then incubated with 10µM of either the JNK or the p38 inhibitor in shear media for 1 hour prior to FSS exposure . FSS exposure was carried out as described below . 40 3 . 2 . 3 : FSS Experiments A POC mini chamber from Hemogenix ( Colorado Springs , CO ) was modified by adding a gasket with a rectangular flow channel to create an adjustable - height parallel - plate flow chamber as previously described ( Yalcin HC , Perry SF , and Ghadiali SN 2007 ) . FSS was calculated using the following equation : 2 6 WH Q w    where τ w is the wall shear stress , µ is the viscosity ( 0 . 007 dynes / cm 2 at 37 ºC ) , Q is the flow speed , and W and H are the width and height of the gasket , respectively . BAOECs were exposed to 15 dynes / cm 2 shear stress ( τ w ) according to the following parameters : W = 1 cm , H = 0 . 01 cm and Q = 2 . 14 ml / min . A constant flow of shear media was supplied to the POC mini parallel - plate flow chamber using a REGLO Digital continuous flow pump from ISMATEC International ( IDEX Health & Science , Wertheim - Mondfeld , Germany ) . The FSS experiments were carried out at 37 ºC . 3 . 2 . 4 : Immunofluorescence Staining Primary antibodies against p - Cofilin ( serine - 3 ) , pLIMK1 / 2 ( threonine - 508 / 505 ) , VE - cadherin , β - catenin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , total Cofilin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Cell Signaling , Boston , MA ) , pLIMK ( serine - 323 ) , or pSSH ( serine - 978 ) ( ECM Biosciences , Versailles , KY ) were used as described in Chapter 2 . Sample preparation for immunofluorescence staining is described in the Chapter 2 . In experiments in which actin stress fibers were detected , TRITC - phalloidin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) was used . For these samples , the cells were fixed with 2 . 0 % formaldehyde ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton - X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cover slips were washed with PBS and incubated with TRITC - phalloidin at the 41 supplier’s recommended dilution overnight at 4ºC . Following incubation , cover slips were mounted as described in Chapter 2 . 3 . 2 . 5 : Cofilin Mutant Transfection Protocol A constitutively active , phosphorylation defective cofilin ( serine - 3 - alanine – S3A ) mutant construct and a constitutively inactive , phosphomimic cofilin ( serine - 3 - aspartic acid – S3D ) mutant were used ( Mutants provided by Theo Rein , Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry , Müchen , Germany ) ( Rüegg J et al . 2004 ) . BAOECs were electroporated with 20 µg / ml of one cofilin construct and GFP - vinculin ( GFP - vinc - provided by Kenneth Yamada , National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research , Bethesda , MD ) as a fluorescent control using the Bio - Rad Gene Pulser X - Cell System ( Hercules , CA ) and the manufacturer’s recommended protocol modified to achieve a confluent monolayer of BAOECs . Briefly , 100 mm confluent plates of cells were trypsinized , rinsed with PBS , suspended in HEPES - buffered saline ( HeBS ) , electroporated , and re - plated . The BAOECs were electroporated with a single 15 . 0 ms pulse of 160 V . Once confluent , the cells were split onto glass cover slips as described above , grown to confluency ( approximately 18 hr ) , and exposed to FSS as described above . GFP - vinc is readily taken up and expressed by BAOECs , but in our experiments did not associate appreciably with focal adhesions in the time between seeding and FSS experiments . Transfection efficiencies close to 100 % were consistently obtained based on GFP - vinc transfection . 3 . 2 . 6 : SDS - PAGE and Western Blotting Confluent BAOECs expressing GFP - vinc , S3A cofilin , or S3D cofilin were harvested and a Western Blot was performed as described in Chapter 2 , with antibodies 42 for p - cofilin or total - cofilin and secondary antibodies conjugated to biotin ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . Blots were developed using ExtraAvidin™ alkaline phosphatase system . 3 . 2 . 7 : Confocal Microscopy Image Analysis Confocal microscopy performed as described in Chapter 2 . ImageJ software was used to determine the integrated fluorescence density of the nucleus and cytoplasm of 10 to 15 cells per replicate . A single replicate consisted of a static , 15 min , 30 min , and in some cases a 60 min time point . Given that gain intensity differs between replicates , a normalization protocol was developed to allow for comparison across replicates with regard to a specific protein . Within a replicate , the changes in integrated fluorescence density values were determined relative to the mean integrated fluorescence density of the static ( and no inhibitor in some cases ) time point . Cell values for each time point within a replicate were averaged , yielding a single mean for each time point within the replicate . These time point mean values were then averaged across replicates and a statistical analysis was performed . For image presentation , the brightness and contrast of all p - cofilin and total cofilin images were increased by a value of 10 in the Zeiss software after analysis to enhance visual clarity . All images are orientated with the direction of FSS from the bottom to the top of the page . 43 3 . 3 : Results 3 . 3 . 1 : FSS - induced changes in cofilin phosphorylation To address the question of cofilin involvement in early actin realignment , FSS - induced changes in cofilin activity were tracked by fluorescently labeling p - cofilin ( serine - 3 ) in confluent BAOECs exposed to 15 dynes / cm 2 FSS for 15 and 30 min . The intensity and spatial distribution of p - cofilin were different depending on the duration of FSS exposure ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . Under static conditions , p - cofilin was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus , with nuclear staining being more intense , signifying a slightly higher concentration of cofilin phosphorylation ( inactive ) in the nucleus . Cytoplasmic p - cofilin decreased in response to FSS by 43 . 56 % at 15 min ( n = 9 , p < 0 . 0001 ) and by 31 . 68 % at 30 min ( n = 5 , p = 0 . 0036 ) relative to static conditions . Nuclear p - cofilin increased in response to FSS by 39 . 00 % at 15 min ( n = 9 , p = 0 . 0011 ) and by 28 . 00 % at 30 min ( n = 4 , p = 0 . 0253 ) relative to static conditions , suggesting that FSS may induce cofilin phosphorylation ( inactivation ) in the nucleus . By 60 min , p - cofilin had returned closer to control levels and differences were no longer significant . These results indicate that cofilin is responsive to FSS as illustrated by FSS - dependent changes in p - cofilin intensity and spatial distribution . Similar experiments to evaluate total cofilin with two different cofilin antibodies showed no FSS - induced differences relative to static conditions ( Figure 3 . 3 ) , indicating that cofilin is phosphorylated and inactivated in a particular location rather than FSS - inducing significant changes in p - cofilin movement or protein degradation . Secondary antibody only controls for both p - cofilin and total cofilin indicate that non - specific detection does not account for the staining patterns seen in both 44 cases ( data not shown ) . Similar results for p - cofilin and total - cofilin were also obtained with formaldehyde and Triton - X - 100 fixed and permeabilized cells ( data not shown ) . Because cofilin staining patterns of other cell types reported in the literature are different than what we observed in confluent endothelial cells , cofilin localization in sub - confluent BAOECs was also determined . Total cofilin localization in sub - confluent BAOECs was primarily cytoplasmic with little nuclear staining . Cytoplasmic total cofilin in sub - confluent BAOECs was slightly elevated compared to confluent BAOECs ( data not shown ) . The staining pattern for p - cofilin in sub - confluent cells largely resembled p - cofilin staining in confluent endothelial cells ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that confluent endothelial layers have different cofilin distributions than sub - confluent cells of many types . 3 . 3 . 2 : Cofilin activity is required for FSS - induced actin realignment In order to determine whether cofilin activity was required for FSS - induced actin realignment , two cofilin mutants were employed ( Figure 3 . 4A ) . GFP - vinc was used as a transfection control and had no effect on FSS - induced actin realignment in the direction of FSS ( Figure 3 . 4A , top panel ) . BAOECs expressing the phosphorylation defective , constitutively active , serine - 3 - alanine ( S3A ) cofilin mutant formed atypical cortical actin bands at 30 min , but failed to start elongating in the direction of FSS at 60 min ( Figure 3 . 4A , middle panel ) . BAOECs expressing the phospho - mimic , constitutively inactive , serine - 3 - aspartic acid ( S3D ) cofilin mutant failed to form cortical actin bands at 30 min and did not start elongating in the direction of FSS at 60 min ( Figure 3 . 4A , bottom panel ) . BAOECs expressing either of the mutants have disorganized actin networks prior 45 to the onset of FSS which persist through FSS , with the S3D mutant resulting in highly atypical actin networks ( Figure 3 . 4A ) . Both S3A and S3D - expressing BAOECs had increased stress fibers relative to GFP - vinc expressing BAOECs , with BAOECs expressing S3D cofilin exhibiting the highest amount of stress fibers ( Figure 3 . 4A ) . Western blots to detect p - cofilin ( Figure 3 . 4B ) and total cofilin ( Figure 3 . 4C ) in BAOECs expressing S3A and S3D cofilin show similar cofilin levels in BAOECs expressing the mutants as compared to GFP - vinc only cells . As shown in Figure 3 . 4B , specific p - cofilin bands were detected around 20 . 3 kD corresponding to the approximate molecular weight of cofilin , and around 27 . 9 kD corresponding to the approximate molecular weight of cofilin plus one ubiquitin . A large specific p - cofilin band around 12 . 5 kD was also detected , indicative of cofilin degradation ( Figure 3 . 4B ) . Consistent with the total cofilin immunofluoresence data , total cofilin western blotting yielded very faint banding patterns similar to those detected in the p - cofilin blot ( Figure 3 . 4C ) . Control cells and cells expressing either cofilin mutant exhibit specific banding patterns consistent with up to four ubiquitin chains indicative of increased targeting for protein degradation in cofilin mutant transfected BAOECs ( data not shown ) . Staining with a different total cofilin antibody resulted in darker staining of the 12 . 5 kD bands , but not darker staining of the intact or high molecular weight specific bands . Taken together , the results indicate that proper cofilin regulation is necessary for FSS - induced actin realignment and that cofilin is significantly degraded in confluent BAOECs . 46 3 . 3 . 3 : JNK and p38 involvement in FSS - induced cofilin phosphorylation It has previously been reported that chemically inhibiting JNK with SP600125 and p38 with SB203580 blocked FSS - induced actin realignment in the direction of FSS ( Mengistu M et al . 2011 , Azuma N et al . 2001 , Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . Under static and FSS conditions , the roles of JNK and p38 in modulating cofilin phosphorylation were determined ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . Pretreatment of BAOECs with SP600125 prior to FSS exposure resulted in significantly decreased cytoplasmic and nuclear p - cofilin . Cytoplasmic p - cofilin was decreased by 42 . 57 % ( n = 4 , p = 0 . 0004 ) and nuclear p - cofilin was decreased by 45 . 00 % ( n = 4 , p = 0 . 0012 ) relative to uninhibited BAOECs at static conditions ( Figure 3 . 4 , middle panel ) . Upon FSS , SP600125 - treated BAOECs exhibited a 50 . 36 % decrease in nuclear p - cofilin at 15 min ( n = 3 , p = 0 . 0264 ) and a non - significant nuclear p - cofilin decrease of 40 . 63 % ( n = 3 , p = 0 . 0745 ) at 30 min ( Figure 3 . 5 , middle panel ) relative to uninhibited BAOECs exposed to FSS for the same duration . BAOECs treated with SP600125 and SB203580 vehicle did not differ from untreated cells at static conditions ( data not shown ) . Pretreatment of BAOECs with SB203580 prior to FSS exposure resulted in significantly decreased p - cofilin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus . Cytoplasmic p - cofilin decreased 38 . 61 % ( n = 5 , p = 0 . 0009 ) and nuclear p - cofilin decreased 30 . 00 % ( n = 5 , p = 0 . 0213 ) relative to uninhibited BAOECs ( Figure 3 . 5 , bottom panel ) . p - cofilin levels in SB203580 pretreated cells were not significantly different from untreated cells after 15 and 30 min of FSS ( Figure 3 . 5 , bottom panel ) . Continual exposure of BAOECs to SP600125 during FSS did not differ from pre - treatment prior to FSS exposure ( data not shown ) . Similar experiments investigating the affect of SP600125 on 47 total cofilin localization showed no difference from untreated cells at the same time points ( data not shown ) . Together these results imply that JNK and to a lesser extent p38 are involved in modulating cofilin activity in BAOECs before and during FSS . 3 . 3 . 4 : FSS - induced increased LIMK phosphorylation Given that the majority of cofilin literature indicates that only dephoshorylated cofilin is capable of nuclear import under various cellular stressors ( i . e . Pendleton A et al . 2003 and Iida K , Matsumoto S , and Yahara I 1992 ) , it is unlikely that p - cofilin is able to translocate to the nucleus . Therefore the major cofilin kinases , LIMK1 / 2 , were analyzed for their roles in FSS - induced phosphorylation of cofilin in the nucleus . Under static conditions , pLIMK1 / 2 ( threonine - 508 / 505 – active ) was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus , with nuclear staining being slightly more intense ( Figure 3 . 6A ) . Cytoplasmic pLIMK1 / 2 increased 46 . 00 % ( n = 5 , p = 0 . 0003 ) at 15 min and 54 . 00 % ( n = 5 , p = 0 . 0348 ) at 30 min of FSS relative to static conditions . Nuclear pLIMK1 / 2 increased 22 . 00 % ( n = 5 , p = 0 . 0407 ) at 15 min and 47 . 00 % ( n = 5 , p = 0 . 0338 ) at 30 min of FSS relative to static conditions . SP600125 was used to inhibit JNK and determine the role of JNK in mediating the effects on LIMK1 / 2 phosphorylation . Cells treated with SP600125 showed no significant differences in pLIMK1 / 2 relative to cells not treated with inhibitor at the same time point , suggesting that JNK is not upstream of pLIMK1 / 2 ( Thr - 508 / 505 ) ( Figure 3 . 6A ) . These results indicate that pLIMK1 / 2 ( Thr - 508 / 505 ) is FSS responsive , providing a potential mechanism for the FSS - induced increase of p - cofilin in the nucleus , but this process does not appear to be mediated by JNK . 48 A second phosphorylation site on LIMK1L ( serine - 323 ) , shown to be a p38 - mediated phosphorylation site ( Kobayashi M et al . 2006 ) , was also probed for FSS - induced activity changes . Under static conditions , pLIMK1L exhibited cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution ( Figure 3 . 6B ) . Upon exposure to 15 dynes / cm 2 FSS for 15 and 30 min , there were no apparent changes in pLIMK1L activity and spatial distribution ( Figure 3 . 6B ) , suggesting that this phosphorylated form of LIMK1L is not responsive to FSS . These results , taken together with the p38 inhibitor results , indicate that p38 is likely not a major player in FSS - induced cofilin changes . Together with the pLIMK1 / 2 results , these results imply that only the conserved Thr - 508 / 205 phosphorylation sites on LIMK1 / 2 are responsive to FSS . 3 . 3 . 5 : Slingshot ( serine - 978 ) phosphorylation is not FSS - dependent Because the changes seen in pLIMK1 / 2 localization cannot completely explain the changes in p - cofilin , FSS - induced localization changes in the major cofilin phosphatase , slingshot , were determined using antibodies specific for phosphorylation at serine - 978 ( pSSH ) , an established inhibitory phosphorylation site ( Soosairajah J et al . 2005 ) . Prior to FSS exposure , pSSH is distributed fairly evenly throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm . Upon exposure to 15 dynes / cm 2 FSS for 15 and 30 min , pSSH intensity did not significantly change in the nucleus or the cytoplasm , suggesting that slingshot activity is not responsive to FSS . In addition , when JNK was inhibited with SP600125 or p38 with SB203580 , no significant differences were seen relative to the same time point without corresponding inhibitor ( Figure 3 . 7A and B ) . In some cases , independent of FSS exposure or inhibitor treatment , a small subset of pSSH was localized to puncta along the 49 cell membrane . Together these results indicate that slingshot phosphorylation at serine - 978 is not responsive to FSS and that JNK and / or p38 is not involved in phosphorylating and inactivating slingshot under these conditions . 3 . 3 . 6 : FSS - Induced VE - Cadherin and β - Catenin Localization at Cell - Cell Junctions It has previously been shown that FSS decreases endothelial barrier permeability and strengthens the endothelial barrier ( DePaola N et al . 2001 , Seebach J et al . 2000 ) . Therefore , we sought to determine the effects of actin realignment on barrier integrity by determining VE - cadherin , and β - catenin localization using the cofilin mutants and stress kinase inhibitors . Under static conditions , VE - cadherin staining was localized primarily to cell - cell contacts ( Figure 3 . 6a , top panel – BAOECs expressing GFP - vinc as a transfection control ) . Upon exposure to FSS , VE - cadherin staining became more regular at cell - cell contacts with fewer small gaps or breaks in the staining ( Figure 3 . 8A , top panel ) , indicating an increase in apparent barrier integrity . This FSS - induced barrier tightening was absent from BAOECs expressing either S3A ( Figure 3 . 8A , middle panel ) or S3D ( Figure 3 . 8A , bottom panel ) cofilin mutants as illustrated by large gaps ( Figure 3 . 8A , arrowheads ) or small breaks ( Figure 3 . 8A , arrows ) in VE - cadherin staining at cell - cell contacts . The gaps present in barrier staining were noticeably larger in BAOECs expressing either cofilin mutant compared to GFP - Vinc . Similar results were obtained when cells were stained for β - catenin ( Figure 3 . 8B ) . Taken together , these results imply that proper cofilin activity and actin alignment is required for enhancing cell - cell junctions during FSS . 50 In similar experiments , BAOECs were treated with SP600125 ( JNK inhibitor ) or SB203580 ( p38 inhibitor ) , exposed to 15 dynes / cm 2 FSS , and VE - cadherin was fluorescently stained . Again , under control conditions , VE - cadherin was localized to cell - cell contacts and apparent barrier integrity increased after FSS exposure ( Figure 3 . 9A , top panel ) . BAOECs treated with either SP600125 or SB203580 failed to exhibit the FSS - induced endothelial barrier tightening seen in the control experiments ( Figure 3 . 9A , bottom panels ) , as evidenced by large gaps ( Figure 3 . 9A , arrowheads ) or small breaks ( Figure 3 . 9A , arrows ) in VE - cadherin staining . The gaps present in barrier staining were noticeably larger in BAOECs treated with either inhibitor compared to uninhibited cells . Similar results were obtained when stained for β - catenin ( Figure 3 . 9B ) . BAOECs treated with SP600125 and SB203580 vehicle did not differ from untreated cells at static conditions ( data not shown ) . Together , these results suggest that JNK and p38 are required to enhance endothelial barrier integrity during FSS . 3 . 5 : Discussion To my knowledge , this is the first report documenting that elevated FSS causes a significant decrease in active cofilin in the nucleus and an increase in active cofilin in the cytoplasm without affecting total cofilin levels in either compartment . The lack of change in total cofilin indicates that FSS likely does not cause expression changes or alter protein degradation during FSS exposure up to 30 min , but rather induces phosphorylation ( activity ) changes . The increase in active cofilin in the cytoplasm would allow for increased actin polymerization needed for cortical actin band formation and realignment 51 of stress fibers in the direction of FSS . The increase in p - cofilin in the nucleus may be necessary to prevent cofilin from being exported back to the cytoplasm . These results help further our understanding of the atheroprotective nature of regions in the vasculature where blood flow is laminar with ECs exhibiting an elongated shape aligned in the direction of FSS ( Langille BL and Adamson SL 1981 , Nerem RM , Levesque MJ , and Cornhill JF 1981 ) . My data also indicate that total cofilin in confluent BAOECs is predominantly nuclear , whereas in sub - confluent BAOECs total cofilin is predominantly cytoplasmic , suggesting that confluent cells require more nuclear cofilin than sub - confluent cells , but the reason for this difference unknown . BAOECs expressing either S3A or S3D cofilin failed to start elongating in the direction of FSS at 60 min , and exhibited highly disorganized actin structures prior to the onset of FSS , suggesting that cofilin is essential for the process of FSS - induced actin realignment . The importance of cofilin activity regulation during FSS - induced actin realignment is illustrated in the fact that both cofilin mutants disrupt proper FSS - induced actin realignment . The increased stress fiber accumulation in the BAOECs expressing S3D cofilin coincides with what would be more p - cofilin ( inactive ) leading to more stress fiber accumulation . S3A - expressing BAOECs still form impaired cortical actin bands , again stressing the need for proper cofilin activity regulation during FSS . All cells ( control or cofilin mutant ) show high levels of cofilin degradation as assayed by western blotting , suggesting that confluent BAOECs significantly degrade cofilin . Banding consistent with ubiquitination was observed in control and cofilin mutant cells , consistent with published evidence suggesting cofilin ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation 52 ( Yoo Y et al . 2010 ) . Western blotting data for total cofilin was consistent with immunofluorescent imaging suggesting that cofilin is predominantly phosphorylated in BAOECs . Having established that the cofilin activity changes are regulated in part by FSS , the roles of stress kinases in this process were determined . Inhibition of JNK with SP600125 and inhibition of p38 with SB203580 significantly reduced the levels of p - cofilin in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm prior to the onset of FSS , establishing a role for JNK and p38 in modulating cofilin phosphorylation under static conditions . After the onset of FSS , we observed no additional affects of p38 inhibition , while JNK inhibition had significant continuing effects on nuclear p - cofilin but not cytoplasmic p - cofilin or nuclear or cytoplasmic total cofilin during FSS . An established p38 - mediated phosphorylation site on LIMK1L ( serine - 323 ) ( Kobayashi M et al . 2006 ) was not FSS - responsive , suggesting that while p38 mediates FSS - induced actin remodeling , it is not due to LIMK1L phosphorylation at serine - 323 . pLIMK1 / 2 ( threonine - 508 / 505 ) increased in the nucleus in response to 15 dynes / cm 2 FSS , ultimately leading to cofilin phosphorylation in the nucleus . Evidence from the literature supports the notion that both LIMK1 and LIMK2 possess a NLS and are capable of nuclear import and export ( Yang N and Mizuno K 1999 , Goyal P et al . 2005 ) . These results suggest that cofilin can be phosphorylated in the nucleus , likely by pLIMK1 / 2 . Despite the responsiveness of pLIMK1 / 2 to FSS , no effects of inhibiting JNK were seen . Although JNK and p38 have established roles in FSS - induced actin realignment and effects on cofilin phosphorylation , it appears that neither is acting 53 through LIMK to facilitate these changes . The increase in cytoplasmic pLIMK1 / 2 in response to FSS is opposite to what we would expect given our data showing decreased cytoplasmic p - cofilin . Evidence from the literature indicates that FSS activates Rho / ROCK , leading to LIMK activation , as shown by in vitro cofilin phosphorylation , without distinguishing between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments ( Lin T et al . , 2003 ) . To examine the pattern of FSS - induced decrease of p - cofilin in the cytoplasm , the responsiveness of the phosphatase slingshot to FSS was determined . Looking specifically at pSSH ( serine - 978 ) , an established inhibitory phosphorylation site known to cause sequestration via 14 - 3 - 3 ( Soosairajah J et al . 2005 ) , it was noted that overall pSSH levels do not change in response to FSS . Despite no FSS - induced pSSH protein level changes , puncta were evident in numerous cells . If SSH is the phosphatase responsible for cofilin dephosphorylation during FSS , JNK or p38 modulation of SSH activity is not mediated through serine - 978 phosphorylation . It is also possible that these stress kinases do not modulate SSH activity . Other phosphatases may be necessary for transducing FSS stimuli . The exact mechanism leading to decreased cytoplasmic cofilin phosphorylation remains unclear . Having determined that common cofilin kinases and phosphatases do not appear to be controlled by JNK or p38 , we suspect that inhibiting JNK and p38 does not directly alter cofilin phosphorylation . Rather the effects of JNK and p38 on changes in cofilin phosphorylation may be due to altered cofilin accessibility instead of altered LIMK or SSH activity . Thus , the p - cofilin product would change , but not the covalent 54 modifications that activate / inactivate the upstream kinases and / or phosphatases . One potential pathway known to regulate cofilin which has also been linked to FSS is the Rho / ROCK pathway , which leads to LIMK activation ( Lin T et al . 2003 ) . Expression of dominant negative mutants of both Rho and ROCK disrupt FSS - induced actin realignment in BAOECs ( Li S et al . 1999 ) . Although this could explain the cofilin phosphorylation under FSS conditions , it does not appear to explain why blocking JNK or p38 decreases cofilin phosphorylation under control conditions . The cofilin regulation system is highly complex making it difficult to map out the signaling events downstream of FSS . It has been shown that SSH not only dephosphorylates ( activates ) cofilin , but is also capable of dephosphorylating ( inactivating ) LIMK , furthering the cell’s ability to activate cofilin ( Soosairajah J et al . 2005 and reviewed in Huang TY , DerMardirossian C , and Bokoch GM 2006 ) . An additional layer of complexity exists in that SSH is also enhanced by F - actin binding to enhance cofilin activation ( Nagata - Ohashi K et al . 2004 , Soosairajah J et al . 2005 , and reviewed in Huang TY , DerMardirossian C , and Bokoch GM 2006 ) . It is possible that the effect of inhibiting JNK and p38 is decreased during FSS , because of enhanced activation of SSH due to increased F - actin induced by the FSS , accompanied by SSH - induced LIMK inactivation and cofilin activation . Since the cofilin mutants and stress kinase inhibitors disrupt FSS - induced actin realignment , they were used to determine how FSS - induced actin realignment affects barrier integrity . Cells expressing either S3A or S3D show numerous gaps and breaks in VE - cadherin or β - catenin staining at cell - cell junctions which were noticeably larger than GFP - vinc only cells , as do cells treated with stress kinase inhibitors . These results 55 suggest that proper cofilin regulation and actin realignment are required to maintain and enhance cell - cell junctions during FSS , which is important for maintaining vascular barrier integrity . These results agree with published data showing that FSS decreases endothelial barrier permeability , preventing the transport of unwanted molecules across the endothelial layer ( DePaola N et al . 2001 , Seebach J et al . 2000 ) . Although we were unable to determine the link between cofilin and JNK or p38 , it is clear that proper cofilin regulation , JNK activity , and p38 activity are required to maintain and enhance endothelial cell junctions . It is reasonable to hypothesize that the central link is the actin cytoskeleton . Improper realignment of the actin cytoskeleton during FSS caused either by mutated cofilin or stress kinase inhibitors results in decreased barrier integrity . Actin associates with adherens junctions via β - catenin , which associates with the cytoplasmic domain of VE - cadherin ( Tharakan B et al . 2012 ) . Therefore disrupting actin realignment during FSS has severe physiological outcomes in preventing FSS - induced barrier integrity , which would allow improper transport across the endothelial layer . These results emphasize the importance of FSS - induced actin realignment and maintenance of barrier integrity . Further support for the actin cytoskeleton in maintaining endothelial cell - cell junctions , was reported by Furman C et al . ( 2007 ) , where they showed that enabled / vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( Ena / VASP ) protein activity is required for normal stress fiber accumulation and cell - cell junction integrity ( Furman C et al . 2007 ) . In summary , this work documents that FSS mediates changes in cofilin phosphorylation . FSS - induced increased p - cofilin in the nucleus is likely due to the need 56 for actin function in the nucleus for elongation of the nucleus in the direction of FSS . pLIMK1 / 2 also increased in the nucleus after FSS exposure suggesting cofilin phosphorylation in the nucleus . Phosphorylation in the nucleus likely blocks export and could be a mechanism to retain cofilin in the nucleus . It is also clear that JNK activity induces cofilin phosphorylation in the nucleus , but this affect does not seem to be due to phosphorylation of LIMK1 / 2 or SSH , which did not change with SP600125 treatment . This suggests that JNK in some way enhances cofilin phosphorylation , but not through directly altering LIMK or SSH activity . Cofilin mutants were used to mimic specific states of cofilin phosphorylation , resulting in decreased correct actin realignment , regardless of whether there was a high level of inactive or of active cofilin . The cofilin mutants and stress kinase inhibitors decrease barrier integrity , illustrating the importance of correct actin realignment in endothelial barrier integrity during FSS . It is becoming clearer that endothelial cells of an artery are constantly exposed to mechanical signals from the shear stress of blood flow . As our understanding of this process continues to expand , a role for shear stress in atherosclerosis is being discovered . For reasons which are still being elucidated , elevated shear stress helps to protect against the development of atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis , as an inflammatory disease , averts most traditional anti - inflammatory mechanisms controlling the development of arterial lesions and plaques . Elevated shear stress has been shown to be anti - inflammatory in the vasculature protecting against the development of atherosclerosis by promoting an intact endothelium . An intact endothelium has anti - inflammatory qualities preventing unwarranted inflammation , whereas “leaky” endothelium is primed for inflammation 57 secreting pro - inflammatory molecules ( 4 - 8 ) . The work done within this chapter demonstrates that through the action of cofilin , FSS - mediated actin realignment is required for maintaining an intact endothelium which is necessary to keep the vasculature in an anti - inflammatory state . 58 3 . 6 : Figures Figure 3 . 3 : FFS - induced changes in cofilin phosphorylation Confluent monolayers of BAOECs were exposed to 15 dynes / cm2 FSS for 15 and 30min .

( Slee JB and Lowe - Krentz LJ . 2013 ) 69 Chapter 4 : Heparin blocks TNF - induced stress responses in vascular endothelium 70 4 . 1 : Introduction The endothelium serves an important role in maintaining the integrity of the vascular system . The endothelium of healthy vasculature is non - thromogenic and anti - inflammatory preventing coagulation and inflammation . Any type of damage to this endothelial layer causes local inflammatory and mitogenic changes in an attempt to repair the wound . These changes cause the endothelial cells to become proliferative to heal the wound in the endothelial layer ( Ross R 1999 ) . If the damage is not properly repaired continued inflammation occurs resulting in increased connective tissue , VSMC proliferation , and eventual atherosclerotic plaque development . The changes noted above in the endothelial layer also result in the cells becoming “sticky” promoting clotting and the recruitment of inflammatory mediators and immune cells ( Spronk H , van der Voort D , and ten Cate H 2004 ) . Endothelial cells lining all blood vessels play an important role during systemic inflammation because of their position and immediate exposure to inflammatory mediators ( Zhao B et al 2003 ) . The two major inflammatory mediators ( cytokines ) that are elevated during systemic inflammation are Interleukin - 1β ( IL - 1β ) and TNFα ( Zhao B et al 2003 ) . Studies have documented that endothelial cells respond to various external stimuli , in part by altering gene expression for cytokines , adhesion molecules , pro - coagulation factors , and other proteins ( Zhao B et al 2003 ) . Therefore , the response elicited by endothelial cells to IL - 1β and TNFα treatment will likely provide necessary information that may help to explain some of the dysfunction that occurs ( Zhao B et al 2003 ) . 71 Stress - activated protein kinase ( SAPK ) enzymes are activated in response to various stressors such as cytokines and inflammatory agents . Activation of JNK occurs in response to select cytokines ( TNFα and IL - 1β ) , various diseases , heat , UV light , hyperosmolarity ( reviewed in Bogoyevitch M and Kobe B 2006 ) . The best characterized responses to JNK activation are changes in transcription occurring as the result of JNK phosphorylation of transcription factors including c - jun , ATF - 2 , Elk - 1 and heat shock factor 1 ( reviewed in Bogoyevitch M and Kobe B 2006 ) . JNK has also been shown to be important in the cytoplasm , having established roles in epithelial and endothelial cell migration and wound repair ( David L et al . 2007 , Shen J and DiCorleto P 2008 , Volin M et al . 2010 , and Zhang L et al . 2005 ) . Some of the substrates of JNK have known links to the actin cytoskeleton , suggesting that JNK may be involved , at least in part , in the regulation of the actin . It has also been shown by members of our lab that JNK associates with the actin cytoskeleton and is important for actin remodeling in vascular endothelial cells ( Hamel M et al . 2006 , Mengistu M et al . 2011 , and reviewed in Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . The p38 family is a second major stress kinase family important in the vasculature system . Inflammatory signals , including TNFα , result in the activation of p38 enzymes ( reviewed in Cuadrado A and Nebreda A 2010 ) . Like JNK , p38 activity is involved in TNFα , VEGF , and hypoxia - induced microfilament remodeling ( Kayyali US et al . 2002 , Kiemer A et al . 2002 , and Liao W , Feng L , Zheng J , DB C 2010 ) . Related to Chaper 1 , shear stress activates p38 to help facilitate FSS - induced actin cytoskeletal remodeling ( Azuma N et al . 2001 , Wang J et al . 2005 , Mengistu M et al . 2011 , and reviewed in 72 Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . p38 also has well - established transcription factor targets such as ATF ( reviewed in Cuadrado A and Nebreda A 2010 ) . The p38 enzymes also phosphorylate and activate other kinases including MAPKAP - 2 , MSK - 1 , and MNK1 ( Cuadrado A and Nebreda A 2010 ) . p38 also has indirect roles in the cytoplasm through MAPKAP - 2 . p38 activity results in phosphorylation of the Arp 2 / 3 complex protein p16 - Arc ( Singh S et al . 2003 ) , HSP27 ( An SS et al . 2005 and McMullen ME et al . 2005 ) , LIMK ( Côté MC et a . 2010 and Kobayashi M et al . 2006 ) , and capZIP ( Eyers CE et al . 2005 ) . Active p38 in shear - stressed endothelial cells grown on collagen has been found in focal adhesions ( Hamel M et al . 2006 and Orr AW et al . 2005 ) and is associated with integrins in cells grown on collagen and laminin ( Wang J et al . 2005 ) . Many of the p38 targets have the ability to modulate the actin cytoskeleton , linking stress activity to cytoskeletal changes . Given the well established role for SAPKs in mediating vascular endothelial cell stress responses , much research has been focused on finding inhibitors of JNK and p38 . Since both JNK and p38 are heavily involved in the inflammatory process , a number of well established anti - inflammatory treatments have been shown to affect the JNK and / or p38 pathways . Two of the better characterized anti - inflammatory treatments that decrease JNK activity include curcumin and aspirin ( Cho J - W et al . 2005 and Jiang G et al . 2003 ) . The same is true for the immunosuppresent FK506 which blocks both p38 and JNK activation ( Kaminska B 2005 ) . Glucocorticoids are natural inhibitors of inflammation and stress signaling , which can decrease SAPKs through the synthesis of MKP - 1 ( Kassel O et al . 2001 and Lasa M et al . 2002 ) . Although effective at reducing inflammation and stress 73 kinase activity , glucocorticoids have many systemic effects which make them unlikely candidates for long - term treatment ( Rhen T and Cidlowski J 2005 ) . Whereas small molecule inhibitors are more specific than glucocorticoids they still target systemic SAPKs as well . As discussed in Chapter 1 , heparin exhibits anti - inflammatory properties that could be of promise for potential therapy ( for review see Slee JB , Pugh R , and Lowe - Krentz 2012 ) . Data collected in the Lowe - Krentz lab indicate that endothelial cell signaling through stress / inflammatory pathways is altered by heparin treatment . We have shown that treatment of vascular endothelial cells with heparin results in decreased p38 activation and decreased p38 target phosphorylation out to 15 min ( Hamel M diss 2001 and Kanyi D diss 2006 ) . The JNK pathway is also affected by heparin treatment . Data suggest that heparin and anti - heparin receptor antibody treatment of endothelial cells results in less JNK activation after treatment with TNFα , and c - jun transcription factor phosphorylation is also decreased ( Hamel M diss 2001 and Kanyi D diss 2006 ) . As is the case with vascular smooth muscle cells , the activation of Hsp27 is also decreased and heparin treatment of vascular endothelial cells results in MKP - 1 synthesis ( Hamel M diss 2001 and Kanyi D diss 2006 ) . The experiments in this chapter were designed to help complete the story initiated by Daniela Kanyi and Marianne Hamel . The purpose of these experiments was to elucidate a physiological endpoint for stress responses in endothelial cells . To do so , I investigated the role of heparin in attenuating TNFα - induced stress kinase activity and actin stress fiber formation . Data collected within this dissertation align well with the 74 previously collected data . Taken together , the collection of data document that heparin alters signal transduction to the actin cytoskeleton through JNK and p38 , and further , that such heparin effects on SAPK activity are dependent on heparin binding to a cell surface receptor as shown for Erk effects in VSMCs ( Savage JM et al . 2001 ) . 4 . 2 : Methods 4 . 2 . 1 : Cell Culture BAOECs were maintained in Cell Applications media and cultured on glass coverslips as described in Chapter 2 for immunofluorescent staining . Cells were seeded at a density that would allow them to be between 50 - 70 % confluent to mimic “wounded” cells in the vasculature . 4 . 2 . 2 : TNFα and Heparin Treatment BAOECs were treated with 50 ng / ml TNFα for 120 min to analyze changes in actin stress fibers and for 10 min to analyze changes in stress kinase ( pJNK and pp38 ) activity . Some cells were pretreated with 200 µg / ml heparin 20 min prior to TNFα stimulation to determine heparin’s affect on these outcomes . Control cells were left untreated and other cells were treated with heparin for 20 min . 4 . 2 . 3 : Immunofluorescence Staining Primary antibodies against pJNK ( Santa Cruz ) and pp38 ( Cell Signaling ) , were used as described in Chapter 2 . Sample preparation for immunofluorescence staining is described in the Chapter 2 , using 4 % PFA and 0 . 3 % Triton . AlexaFlour488® - phalloidin 75 was used to detect actin stress fibers and was included with secondary antibody incubation . 4 . 2 . 4 : Fluorescent Microscopy Fluorescent microscopy was performed as described in Chapter 2 . 4 . 3 : Results As shown in Figure 4 . 1 , 50 ng / ml TNFα causes significantly increased stress fibers and nuclear stress kinase activity in BAOECs . Controls cells exhibit very few stress fibers and a 20 min heparin ( 200 µg / ml ) treatment seems to reduce their levels even further ( Figure 4 . 1A ) . A 50 ng / ml TNFα treatment for 120 min significantly increased actin stress fiber intensity and number , which is significantly attenuated by a 20 min heparin pretreatment ( Figure 4 . 1A ) . The 20 min heparin pretreatment reduces stress fiber intensity and number to a level comparable to untreated control cells ( Figure 4 . 1A ) . These results suggest that heparin represses TNFα - induced stress fiber formation in vascular endothelial cells . Shorter treatments of TNFα were necessary to identify visible changes in nuclear stress kinase activity ( pJNK and pp38 ) . As shown in Figure 4 . 1B , BAOECs have a basal level of nuclear stress kinase activity , which is reduced by a 20 min heparin treatment . Following a brief 10 min TNFα ( 50 ng / ml ) treatment , both pJNK and pp38 in the nucleus are significantly increased compared to untreated control ( Figure 4 . 1B ) . Nuclear p38 activity increases more than nuclear JNK activity at this treatment time of TNFα , however pJNK increases have been noted after 120 min TNFα treatment ( data not 76 shown ) . As was the case for stress fiber induction , a 20 min pretreatment with heparin markedly reduces both pJNK and pp38 relative to TNFα - treated cells ( Figure 4 . 1B ) . The cells treated with heparin prior to TNFα stimulation exhibit nuclear pJNK and pp38 levels comparable to control cells . These data suggest that heparin attenuates TNFα - induced nuclear stress kinase activity . 4 . 4 : Discussion The actin cytoskeleton reorganizes in response to extracellular conditions . TNFα - induced actin polymerization involves p38 ( Kiemer A et al . 2002 ) which is required for hypoxia - induced actin redistribution to stress fibers ( Kayyali US et al . 2002 ) . p38 and JNK are also involved in smooth muscle cell actin expression and remodeling ( Tock J et al . 2003 and Wang J et al . 2005 ) . Finally , the addition of growth factors to endothelial cells causes both cytoskeletal rearrangement and the activation of SAPK pathway constituents ( Xia Y et al . 2000 ) . Focal adhesions link the internal cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix . Signaling through integrins from the extracellular matrix outside causes the rearrangement of the cytoskeletal architecture ( Applin AE et al . 1998 ) . Stress - activated protein kinases have been shown to be activated in response to signaling through the focal adhesions ( Oktay M et al . 1999 ) . In endothelial cells , stress fibers align parallel to the direction of blood flow ; and the ends of stress fibers become associated with focal adhesions during flow - induced reorganization ( Girard PR and Nerem RM 1995 ) . When endothelial cells are subjected to shear stress , actin fibers become realigned in a manner 77 which depends on p38 ( Azuma N et al . 2001 and Wang J et al . 2005 ) and JNK ( Mengistu M et al . 2011 ) . Adhesion - induced focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) activation causes the activation of JNK and p38 ( Almeida E et al . 2000 , Jo H et al . 1997 , and Li S et al . 1997 ) . As discussed in Chapter 1 , heparin has been shown to decrease inflammation , and research from our laboratory and others indicates that heparin causes decreases in vascular smooth muscle cell ERK activation through binding to a receptor . Our original identification of the heparin receptor was in endothelial cells , suggesting that vascular endothelium could be a target for the anti - inflammatory nature of heparin . Therefore , I examined the possibility that heparin would induce decreases in endothelial stress kinase activity and thereby alter stress kinase - based cytoskeletal rearrangements . Heparin treatment of endothelial cells did result in blocking TNF - α induced stress fiber changes ( Figure 4 . 1A ) . This is consistent with heparin having anti - inflammatory effects beyond those of interfering directly with selectin - dependent cell adhesion in the vasculature . Heparin treatment also caused decreases in JNK and p38 activity at shorter TNFα treatment times ( Figure 4 . 1B ) . This suggests that heparin has potential as an anti - inflammatory molecule to reverse the damage to the endothelial layer caused by excessive TNFα - induced inflammation in atherosclerotic vasculature . Combining my data with the work performed by Marianne Hamel and Daniela Kanyi showed that not only does heparin attenuate TNFα - induced stress fibers and nuclear stress kinase activity ; it also has inhibitory roles on TNFα - induced c - jun transcription factory phosphorylation , Hsp27 activation , and Erk activation through the action of MKP - 1 . Given that heparin induces nuclear stress kinase activity changes , this presents the possibility that heparin 78 could also be inducing transcriptional changes . The culmination of this work will be a publication furthering our understanding of heparin as an anti - inflammatory molecule in vascular endothelium . 79 4 . 5 : Figure Figure 4 . 1 : Heparin attenuates TNFα - induced stress fibers and nuclear stress kinase activity ( A ) BAOECs stained for actin stress fibers with AlexaFluor®488 - Phalloidin .

Scale bars = 10 µm . 80 Chapter 5 : Identification of the heparin receptor : building the case for TMEM184A 81 5 . 1 : Introduction It has been well established that many cells including vascular cells , such as endothelial and smooth muscle , bind and internalize heparin ( egs . Bârzu T et al . 1985 and Castellot JJ et al . 1985 ) and have well - established responses to heparin ( egs . Reilly CF et al . 1989 , Fasciano S et al . 2005 , Vadivello PK et al . 1997 , and Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . The same is true for cells that are not known to be heparin sensitive or possess known heparin signaling pathways , such as HeLa cells , which have been shown to internalize heparin which has been reported to end up in the nucleus ( Busch SJ et al . 1992 ) . The fact that cells bind / internalize heparin but are not heparin sensitive raises the possibility that most or all cells bind / internalize heparin but lack the downstream signaling molecules involved in transducing the signal . This suggests that most or all cells have a receptor for heparin , but may or may not be sensitive to heparin . Along with tagged heparin uptake , it has also been widely documented in the literature and by previous members of the Lowe - Krentz laboratory that heparin mediates a portion of its effects through a cell surface receptor , suggesting that a putative heparin receptor exists on the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells ( Savage JM et al . 2001 and Castellot JJ et al . 1984 ) and vascular endothelial cells ( Patton WA et al . 1995 and Barzu T et al . 1986 ) . It has also been documented by previous members of our lab that treatments with monoclonal antibodies that block heparin binding to endothelial cells also mimic the effects of heparin in vascular smooth muscle cells ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 and Savage JM et al . 2001 ) and vascular endothelial cells ( Patton WA et al . 1995 ) . The results from studies using the monoclonal antibodies against the heparin receptor are the 82 most convincing results suggesting that heparin acts via a receptor . Using the monoclonal antibodies in place of heparin in cell proliferation or stress assays removes any potential for heparin to act via electrostatic interactions or based solely on sequestering growth factor and cytokines . However , it is clear that heparin does also act via electrostatic interactions and sequestrations of certain molecules ; therefore , heparin may act through multiple ways to influence cell behavior ( Ali S et al . 2003 ; Ranjbaran H et al . 2006 ; Hatakeyama M et al . 2004 , Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 , Savage JM et al . 2001 , Patton WA et al . 1995 , and reviewed in : Slee JB , Pugh R , Lowe - Krentz LJ . 2012 ) . Given the complexity of regulation that heparin and heparin - like molecules have over proliferation of vascular cells , the fact that heparin - induced decreases in ERK activity are effective whether growth factors are inducing the activity or phorbol esters are employed ( Mishra - Gorur K and Castellot JJ 1999 , Ottlinger ME , Pukac LA , and Karnovsky MJ 1993 , Pukac LA et al . 1997 ) , and the fact that antibodies to a putative heparin receptor are equally functional ( Savage JM et al . 2001 , Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) , it is unlikely that these anti - proliferative affects are due to heparin - like molecules blocking growth factor binding . This presents a situation in which heparin could be acting through a receptor to mediate its downstream signaling . Heparin is a very negatively charged molecule and is considerably larger than most biological molecules , making it virtually impossible for simple diffusion across the membrane . The size and highly charged nature of heparin chains makes receptor - mediated endocytosis the most likely mechanism for transport across the membrane . 83 Although it is well - documented that the heparin receptor exists , there has not been published evidence reporting the isolation and characterization of the receptor . Therefore our lab set out to identify a receptor for heparin . Unpublished data collected by Raymond Pugh Ph . D . for his doctoral dissertation suggest that he was able to isolate and purify the heparin receptor from BAOECs using the monoclonal anti - heparin receptor antibodies ( Pugh R . Diss 2010 ) . Through a collaboration with Walter Patton Ph . D . ( Lebanon Valley College , former Lowe - Krentz lab member ) , Pugh was able to obtain a limited amount of protein sequence data . To obtain this sequence data , ladder sequencing of the receptor was performed using MALDI - TOF ( Matrix - Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization – Time of Flight ) Mass Spectrometry . This technique has been outlined in the literature , demonstrating the use of carboxypeptidase Y to generate C - terminal cleavage products ( ladders ) of a peptide ( or peptides ) followed by MALDI - TOF analysis to first identify peptides ( Patton WA 2004 ) . Briefly , the receptor protein was cleaved first with trypsin or chymotrypsin to generate short peptides , followed by carboxypeptidase Y digestion , producing the amino acids or ladders . The mass lost from each cleavage corresponds to a specific amino acid , which allows for the sequencing of peptide fragments . Bioinformatic searches can then used to find sequence similarities to known proteins / genes . This technique yielded several hits to Transmembrane Protein 184A ( TMEM184A ) , which is an uncharacterized transmembrane protein . These results suggest but do not confirm that Raymond Pugh had isolated and purified what could be the putative heparin receptor . Having identified TMEM184A as a potential heparin receptor presents the opportunity for further research aimed at validating TMEM184A as 84 the heparin receptor . Also , given the fact that TMEM184A is still largely uncharacterized , the opportunity exists to explore its sub - cellular distribution and conservation across cell types . Virtually any findings regarding TMEM184A conservation , localization , and function are novel and important . Therefore , concurrent with linking TMEM184A function to the heparin receptor , work aimed at characterizing TMEM184A was also completed . The sequencing of the human and other genomes has identified a host of genes with unknown functions . TMEM184A or sexually dimorphic expressed in male gonads ( Sdmg1 ) is one protein identified through genome sequencing which still does not have a clearly defined function . TMEM184A is predicted to be a multi - pass transmembrane protein and contains a potential C - terminal dileucine targeting motif for endosome / lysosome targeting ( Best D et al . 2008 and Bonifacino JS and Traub LM 2003 ) . A few studies document roles in germ cell sex differentiation ( Best D et al . 2008 ) , membrane trafficking in SK11 Sertoli cells , and expression in secretory exocrine cells ( Best D and Adams IR 2009 ) . Other than these published reports , there is very little information about TMEM184 expression patterns in other cell types or evidence for a specific function of TMEM184A . In SK11 Sertoli cells , TMEM184A is localized to endosomes and knock down leads to defects in membrane trafficking ( Best D et al . 2008 ) . TMEM184A was found to co - localize with two distinct endosomal populations in SK11 Sertoli cells : vesicle - associated membrane protein ( VAMP ) - 7 - containing perinuclear endosomes , and VAMP3 / 8 - containing peripheral endosomes ( Best D et al . 2008 ) . It has also been shown 85 in pancreatic acinar cells that TMEM184A co - localizes with VAMP2 in secretory granules ( Best D and Adams IR 2009 ) . VAMPs ( synaptobrevins ) are a family of SNARE ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor - attachment protein receptor ) proteins anchored in the membrane by a carboxy - terminal transmembrane domain and involved in membrane transport primarily by mediating vesicle fusion ( Chen YA and Scheller RH 2001 , Reinhard J and Scheller SH 2006 , Fasshauer D et al . 1998 , and Laage R et al . 2000 ) . It has been suggested that TMEM184A could facilitate intra - lumenal cargo interaction with lipid microdomains or cytosolic membrane trafficking proteins ( Best D et al . 2008 ) . Caveolae ( lipid rafts ) are non - clathrin - coated invaginations of the plasma membrane and are present in most mammalian cell types and particularly prominent in endothelial cells ( Sowa G 2012 ) . Caveolins act as scaffolds in caveolae which concentrate numerous receptors and signaling molecules involved in transport and signal transduction ( Parton and Simmons 2007 , Patel HH , Murray F , and Insel PA 2008 , and Rath G , Dessy C , and Feron O 2009 ) . Caveolin - 1 ( cav - 1 ) is expressed in most cell types and is essential for caveolae formation ( Sowa G 2012 ) . Lipid rafts containing cav - 1 are important in vascular endothelial cells , where they have been linked to the regulation of eNOS ( endothelial nitric oxide synthase ) which is involved in the control of vascular reactivity and inflammation ( Chidlow JH and Sessa WC 2010 and Rath G , Dessy C , and Feron O 2009 ) . TMEM184A may have a functional role in vascular cells , given the large amount of intracellular transport these cells perform . In fact , all cells transport proteins to and 86 from the plasma membrane and would likely have this protein if it is involved in vesicle trafficking . Therefore , I aimed to determine the presence of TMEM184A in vascular cells and a range of other cell types and to begin elucidation of the function of TMEM184A in these cells . To our knowledge , this is the first report documenting the presence of TMEM184A in a broad range of cells types . Using western blotting and immunofluorescent microscopy , we have identified TMEM184A as more widely expressed than previously thought , where it co - localizes with VAMP - 1 , 2 , and / or 3 , cav - 1 , and eNOS . Given these findings , it is likely that TMEM184A is conserved across many cell types where it may play a role in membrane trafficking and / or signal transduction . The goals of this chapter were to confirm the identification of the heparin receptor and to characterize TMEM184A as the probable receptor for heparin . The first aim of this chapter was to characterize TMEM184A in vascular cells ( BAOECs , BAOSMCs , and RAOSMCs ) as well as two cell lines ( CHOs and MDCKs ) and a fourth primary cell type MEFs . The second aim was to functionally identify TMEM184A as the heparin receptor using immunoprecipitations and siRNA / shRNA - mediated knockdown of TMEM184A coupled to functional assays . It is important to note that although these experiments were treated independently , they overlap signficantly . The results from characterizing TMEM184A in different cell types support the notion that TMEM184A functions as a receptor for heparin . The siRNA / shRNA experiments do not in any way conflict with data characterizing TMEM184A in the cells investigated . Therefore , this collection of 87 seemingly independent studies is actually quite interrelated and helps to further our understanding of TMEM184A as a receptor for heparin . The portions of this work relating to the presence of TMEM184A in BAOECs , BAOSMCs , RAOSMCs , CHOs , MDCKs , and MEFs and co - localization with VAMP , cav - 1 , and eNOS has been submitted to FEBS Letters Open Access for publication . Data collected with the HeLa cell line was not submitted for publication with the other cell lines . 5 . 2 : Methods 5 . 2 . 1 : Cell Culture BAOECs , BAOSMCs , RAOSMCS , CHOs , MEFs , MDCKs , and HeLas were maintained and cultured on glass coverslips as described in Chapter 2 for immunofluorescent staining . 5 . 2 . 2 : Immunofluorescence Staining Primary antibodies against TMEM184A - NTD , TMEM184A - INT , VAMP1 / 2 / 3 , cav - 1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , and TMEM184A - CTD ( ProSci Inc . Poway , CA ) were used as described in Chapter 2 . The TMEM184A - NTD primary antibody is specific for a stretch of amino acids ( 11 - 63 ) near the N - terminus of human TMEM184A . The TMEM184A - CTD primary antibody specific for the C - terminal region was developed against a 16 amino acid region near the C - terminus of TMEM184A . The TMEM184A - INT primary antibody specific for an internal region of TMEM184A is developed for 20 amino acids between 250 and 300 . 88 This is not meant to imply an intracellular region of TMEM184A , rather a stretch of amino acids in the middle of the protein . 5 . 2 . 3 : TMEM184A siRNA Electroporation Protocol A7r5s were the cells used for electroporation with TMEM184A siRNA . A single 100 mm plate of cells was trypsinized and pelleted . The cell pellet was resuspended in 1X PBS and pelleted again . The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of HeBS electroporation buffer and divided into the following three samples ( 335 μl each ) : 1 . Negative control – not electroporated 2 . Control siRNA – electroporated with 5 μM control siRNA ( in some cases FITC - siRNA ) 3 . TMEM184A siRNA – electroporated with 5 μM TMEM184A siRNA Cells were electroporated using the BioRad electroporator with the HeLa protocol modified to 170 V . After electroporation , the three samples were divided equally onto coverslips in 6 well culture dishes , providing a 6 well dish for each condition ( negative control , control siRNA , and TMEM184A siRNA ) . Cells were fed supplemented media the next day to remove any HeBS electroporation buffer and were allowed to proliferate for approximately 72 hours prior to experimentation . 5 . 2 . 4 : Heparin Assay in TMEM184A siRNA - treated Cells Within each of the three groups described in the previous section , two coverslips served as controls , two were treated with PDGF for 15 min , and two were treated with 200 μg / ml heparin for 20 min prior to PDGF treatment for 15 min . One control coverslip from each treatment was fixed with 4 . 0 % PFA , but not permeabilized , and stained for 89 TMEM184A - INT and pERK ( Santa Cruz Biotech ) to visualize surface staining on the confocal microscope . One PDGF 15min and Heparin 20 min / PDGF 15min set was TMEM184A - INT and pElk - 1 ( Santa Cruz Biotech ) . The three remaining coverslips ( control , PDGF 15 min , and Heparin 20 min / PDGF 15 min ) were stained for TMEM184A - INT and pElk - 1 . Antibody treatment was described in Chapter 2 . 5 . 2 . 5 : TMEM184A shRNA Electroporation Protocol A7r5s were electroporated with 20 µg / ml plasmids containing sequences for expression of short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) as described above for TMEM184A siRNA . Four plasmids bearing four different shRNA sequences and a GFP tag were obtained from Origene along with a GFP - tagged scrambled non - specific control shRNA plasmid . Initially all four TMEM184A shRNA constructs were tested for transfection and knockdown efficiencies by looking for GFP expression and decreased TMEM184A expression / staining . Once a strong decrease in TMEM184A was evident , the two shRNA constructs that consistently provided the most significant knockdown were chosen for further study . 5 . 2 . 6 : Fluorescent Heparin Uptake BAOECs , BAOSMCs , MDCKs , and MEFs were treated with 100 µg / ml Rhodamine - conjugated heparin ( Creative PEG Works , Winston - Salem , NC ) for 1 , 5 , and 7 min . After Rhodamine - heparin incubation , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA but not permeabilized , as described in Chapter 2 . Cells were not permeabilized , because doing so results in some of the Rhodamine - heparin leaking out of cells . 90 5 . 2 . 7 : GFP - tagged TMEM184A ( GFP - TMEM184A ) co - localization with Rhodamine - Heparin A7r5s were transfected with 20 µg / ml GFP - TMEM184A using the electroporation settings used for siRNA / shRNA described above . After 24 - 48 hr , cells were treated with 100 µg / ml Rhodamine - heparin for 1 - 10 min and fixed with 4 % PFA without permeabilzation to allow for better retention of Rhodamine - heparin . Slides were processed for confocal microscopy as described in Chapter 2 . 5 . 2 . 8 : Fluorescent Microscopy Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine whole cell expression levels of TMEM184A , relative knockdown of TMEM184A in siRNA / shRNA - treated cells , and the PDGF / Heparin - induced responses in pERK and pElk - 1 levels . Performed as described in Chapter 2 . 5 . 2 . 9 : Confocal Microscopy Confocal microscopy was used to visualize sub - cellular structure , localization of TMEM184A and co - localization with VAMP1 / 2 / 3 , caveolin - 1 , or eNOS , surface staining of TMEM184A , GFP - TMEM184A , and Rhodamine - heparin uptake . Performed as described in Chapter 2 . 5 . 2 . 10 : SDS - PAGE and Western Blotting Confluent BAOECs , BAOSMCs , CHOs , MDCKs , and MEFs were harvested , and a Western Blot was performed as described in Chapter 2 . Primary antibodies described in the immunofluorescence microscopy section of this chapter were used for Western 91 Blotting . Blots were developed using ExtraAvidin™ alkaline phosphatase , BCIP , and NBT or the ECL system as described in Chapter 2 . 5 . 2 . 11 : Heparin Receptor Immunoprecipitation Confluent 150 mm dishes of BAOECs and BAOSMCs were harvested in radioimmunoprecipitation ( RIPA ) buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 10µM Tris pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 1 % Triton - X - 100 , and 0 . 5 % deoxycholate ) ( Sigma ) , supplemented with two protease inhibitor cocktails ( Sigma , P8340 and P2714 ) used at the manufacturer’s recommended concentrations . Briefly , 150 mm dishes were rinsed with cold PBS twice and incubated with 1 ml of RIPA buffer for 30 min at 4 ºC with rocking . Following this incubation , cells were scraped off the plates and placed in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 10 , 000 xg . The supernatant was mixed with 2 µg / ml of anti - heparin receptor monoclonal antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 ºC on a rocker . After antibody incubation , 75 µl of equilibrated EZview red protein G affinity gel beads ( Sigma ) were added and incubated overnight at 4 ºC on a rocker . After bead incubation , the beads were rinsed with RIPA buffer three times and protein was isolated by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer for 5 min . Western Blots were performed as described above with antibodies specific for TMEM184A - NTD . 92 5 . 3 : Results 5 . 3 . 1 : TMEM184A is detectable in vascular cells by Western Blotting and IF microscopy To determine if TMEM184A is present in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells , whole cell western blots were carried out for BAOECs and BAOSMCs . As shown in Figure 5 . 1A , distinct bands are present in the predicted molecular weight range of TMEM184A that are absent from secondary antibody only controls . The doublet bands could be due to post translational modifications ( glycosylation ) which have been suggested in other reports ( Best D et al . 2008 ) . These results suggest that TMEM184A is present in vascular cells at levels high enough to be detected by Western Blotting . To gain a better understanding of TMEM184A sub - cellular localization , BAOECs , BAOSMCs , and RAOSMCs were stained with three separate TMEM184A primary antibodies described in the methods section . As shown in Figure 5 . 1B , TMEM184A is detectable by confocal microscopy in the three vascular cell types investigated , and each of the three antibodies recognizes a specific subset of TMEM184A . The N - Terminal antibody highlights TMEM184A peri - nuclear staining in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells ( Figure 5 . 1B – NTD ) . The C - Terminal antibody detects TMEM184A that is localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and a subset associated with the membrane ( Figure 5 . 1B – CTD ) . Although the peri - nuclear staining is not completely clear , the CTD detection is more intense in peri - nuclear regions agreeing with the data from the NTD detection showing peri - nuclear staining . The internal TMEM184A antibody recognizes a mixture of both NTD and CTD staining , showing 93 both peri - nuclear staining and a small amount of cytoplasmic staining ( Figure 5 . 1B – INT ) , further indicative of peri - nuclear localization of TMEM184A . To ensure that this staining pattern was not a bovine cell type specific phenomenon , rat primary cells ( RAOSMCs ) were also examined and show the same patterns as the bovine cells . Since TMEM184A is predicted to be a transmembrane protein , we investigated whether it was detectable on the surface of vascular cells . As shown in Figure 5 . 1B , cells that were fixed with 4 % PFA and not permeabilized show specific staining patterns on the surface of cells , suggesting that TMEM184A does , in fact , localize to the membrane ( Figure 5 . 1B – right column ) . These results confirm that TMEM184A is not just limited to germ cells and secretory exocrine cells as previously published . I hypothesize that each antibody recognizes a slightly different sub - cellular location of TMEM184A due to antigen accessibility in the different locations . TMEM184A is predicted to be a multi - pass transmembrane protein therefore certain regions of the protein may not be easily accessible for antibody recognition under these fixation conditions . Given these results , it is clear that TMEM184A is localized to peri - nuclear and cytoplasmic regions of vascular cells as well as at the cell surface . These data agree with published evidence documenting peri - nuclear localization of TMEM184A in SK11 sertoli cells lines ( Best D et al . 2008 ) and extend known locations to the cell surface . 5 . 3 . 2 : TMEM184A is expressed in a variety of cells Having identified TMEM184A in vascular cells , we hypothesized that this protein may be expressed in a wider range of cell types than germ cells and certain secretory 94 exocrine cells ( Best D et al . 2008 and Best D and Adams IR 2009 ) , given published data suggesting a role for TMEM184A in membrane transport . Therefore , Western Blot analysis was performed to determine if TMEM184A was expressed in CHO , MEF , and MDCK cells . As shown in Figure 5 . 2A , specific proteins are seen in the predicted molecular weight region of TMEM184A that are absent from secondary antibody only controls , suggesting that TMEM184A is also present in cells outside of the vascular system . Having documented that TMEM184A is expressed in CHO , MEF , and MDCK cells via Western Blotting , sub - cellular distribution was determined by IF microscopy . The staining pattern seen with the CHOs is peri - nuclear and cytoplasmic ( Figure 5 . 2B – CHO ) , as with the vascular cells . The MEFs show the most similar staining patterns to the vascular cells having large amounts of peri - nuclear TMEM184A seen with all three antibodies ( Figure 5 . 2B – MEF ) . MDCKs exhibited less well - defined peri - nuclear staining with all three antibodies and more well - defined membrane localization when stained with the NTD and Internal TMEM184A antibodies ( Figure 5 . 2B – MDCK ) . The three different TMEM184A antibodies recognize slightly different sub - cellular localizations of the protein , which is consistent across all cell types investigated . Determining that peri - nuclear staining is detected across all cells investigated , suggests that TMEM184A could be serving similar purposes in multiple cell types as to what has been documented in the SK11 sertoli cell line ( Best D et al . 2008 ) . 95 5 . 3 . 3 : TMEM184A co - localizes with VAMP Because vascular cells serve as a highly selective barrier and perform large amounts of intracellular vesicle transport , we hypothesized that TMEM184A also plays a role in membrane transport universally . To examine this hypothesis , co - localization with an antibody that recognizes VAMP - 1 , 2 , and 3 ( VAMP ) was investigated . The antibody used to detect VAMP was specific for isoforms 1 , 2 , and 3 of VAMP , because TMEM184A has been shown to co - localize with VAMP2 and 3 containing endosomes in SK11 Sertoli cells and pancreatic acinar cells ( Best D et al . 2008 and Best D and Adams IR 2009 ) . As shown in Figure 5 . 3A , vascular cells express a large amount of VAMP , which is diffuse through the cytoplasm with intense clusters in defined peri - nuclear regions where it co - localizes with TMEM184A . RAOSMCs and BAOECs show a large amount of co - localization at peri - nuclear regions ( Figure 5 . 3A ) . These data are consistent with the results shown in germ cells and exocrine cells ( Best D et al . 2008 and Best D and Adams IR 2009 ) , suggesting that TMEM184A also functions in exocytosis and / or vesicular trafficking in vascular cells . To determine if this co - localization with VAMP was conserved across multiple cells lines , similar experiments were carried out in CHO , MEF , and MDCK cells . The staining in the MEF cells most closely resembles the data from the vascular cells showing TMEM184A co - localization with VAMP at peri - nuclear regions ( Figure 5 . 3B – MEF ) , again suggesting a role in membrane transport . The data from the CHO and MDCK cells are slightly different from vascular cells and MEF cells . As shown in Figure 5 . 3B , the staining pattern in CHO cells indicates that TMEM184A and VAMP co - localize at 96 defined membrane patches and around cytoplasmic vesicles more so than in peri - nuclear regions . The CTD antibody was used to detect TMEM184A in the CHO cell line because the NTD antibody gave diffuse staining without specific localization . The MDCK cell line showed the least amount of TMEM184A co - localization with VAMP , but still exhibited a small amount of co - localization at membrane regions ( Figure 5 . 3B – MDCK ) . Taken together , these results suggest that TMEM184A may play a role in membrane trafficking in all cells investigated , highlighting the importance of this protein . Given the conservation of TMEM184A expression and similarities in staining patterns and co - localization with VAMP to previously published work ( Best D et al . 2008 and Best D and Adams IR 2009 ) , it is likely that TMEM184A is involved in membrane transport in a variety of cell types . 5 . 3 . 4 : TMEM184A co - localizes with CAV - 1 and eNOS in vascular cells Cav - 1 is considered to be a cell signaling hub and has been linked to the regulation of vesicle transport in most cells and especially cells of the vasculature ( Chidlow JH and Sessa WC 2010 ) . Based on the importance of cav - 1 in vascular cells , we investigated the hypothesis that TMEM184A co - localizes with cav - 1 . As shown in Figure 5 . 4A , cav - 1 staining is localized primarily to patches of membrane , where a subset co - localizes with TMEM184A staining , further suggesting that TMEM184A is playing a role in membrane transport and potentially in cell signaling mediated through lipid rafts . The other three cell types investigated , CHO , MDCK , and MEF cells express cav - 1 to lesser degrees than vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells ( Figure 5 . 4B ) . These cells exhibit co - localization with cav - 1 at membrane patches , even though they express 97 lower levels of cav - 1 ( Figure 5B ) . The co - localization in all three cell lines occurs primarily at membrane patches of some but not all cells , typically on the exterior of clusters of cells ( Figure 5 . 4B ) . These data suggest that TMEM184A is localized to cav - 1 - containing lipid rafts where it may influence lipid raft - based cell signaling events and / or in vesicle trafficking . Given that TMEM184A and cav - 1 co - localize in vascular cells , we hypothesized that TMEM184A would also co - localize with eNOS given its prominent role in mediating signaling events downstream of lipid rafts in vascular cells . As shown in Figure 5 . 5 , TMEM184A - INT co - localizes with eNOS in the characteristic peri - nuclear regions in the three vascular cells investigated . These data raise the possibility that TMEM184A could be an important player in mediating lipid raft signal transduction through its co - localization with cav - 1 and eNOS , two of the more well - defined lipid raft molecules . Suggested cav - 1 interaction sequences are common among many transmembrane proteins and appear to be found in putative transmembrane segments of TMEM184A . These segments may or may not be critical for cav - 1 interactions with other proteins but if they are , it appears that TMEM184A has these sequences available for interaction with cav - 1 ( Byrne DP , Dart C , and Rigden DJ 2012 ) . Despite the probability of interaction , immunoprecipitation with TMEM184A - NTD did not appear to pull down cav - 1 along with the TMEM184A ( data not shown ) . 5 . 3 . 5 : TMEM184A is present in HeLa cells In addition to the cells reported above , the presence of TMEM184A in HeLa cells was investigated . HeLa cells have a significant amount of TMEM184A as determined by 98 IF microscopy ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . TMEM184A staining in HeLa cells is similar to the staining seen in the other cell lines investigated . TMEM184A is concentrated in peri - nuclear regions , with faint localization throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . Specific detection of TMEM184A was also seen on the surface of cells that were fixed with 4 % PFA but not permeabilized ( Figure 5 . 6 ) . It is expected that TMEM184A would co - localize with VAMP in the peri - nuclear region given that in all cells tested this was the case ( Figure 5 . 3 ) . The presence of TMEM184A suggests that HeLa cells could internalize heparin . HeLa cells have been previously shown to internalize FITC - heparin which ultimately ends up in the nucleus ( Busch SJ et al . 1992 ) . Therefore expression of TMEM184A correlates with previously published reports documenting heparin internalization in HeLa cells . 5 . 3 . 6 : All Cells Investigated Internalize Rhodamine - Heparin To investigate whether a heparin binding protein exists on most cells , despite the lack of evidence for heparin signaling , Rhodamine - heparin uptake assays were performed in BAOECs , BAOSMCs , MDCKs , and MEFs . As shown in Figure 5 . 7 , all cells investigated internalize Rhodamine - heparin to varying degrees . Control cells were not treated with Rhodamine - heparin and exhibit a small amount of auto - fluorescence seen in most cultured cells ( Figure 5 . 7 ) . In general , the trend seen in Rhodamine - heparin uptake is that more heparin is internalized by cells up to 7 min , as shown by increased puncta and overall cytoplasmic staining ( Figure 5 . 7 ) , where it leveled off and remained relatively unchanged ( data not shown ) . Beyond 7 min , it was difficult to determine new Rhodamine - heparin uptake versus old Rhodamine - heparin recycling / degradation . 99 Therefore timing was kept fairly short to ensure that most new Rhodamine - heparin uptake was observed . These results suggest that cells which have been shown to possess TMEM184A ( Figures 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 ) functioning in vesicle trafficking and cell signaling ( Figures 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 , and 5 . 5 ) also internalize heparin . These results support our hypothesis that TMEM184A is a receptor for heparin , because TMEM184A expression and labeled heparin uptake occur in the same cells . 5 . 3 . 7 : Immunoprecipitation of the Heparin Receptor Detects TMEM184A To determine if the heparin receptor could be immunoprecipitated from BAOECs , the monoclonal antibodies against the heparin receptor were used to IP the heparin receptor and were then Western Blotted with the TMEM184A - NTD and CTD antibodies . The data suggest that TMEM184A was specifically detected when the heparin receptor antibodies were used . The results of the IP are oriented so that the antibodies listed at the top are the Western Blot antibodies and the antibodies below them ( shown on an angle ) are the IP antibodies . As shown in the far right two columns of Figure 5 . 8 , VE - cadherin was used as an IP control demonstrating that the IP process was successful . There is a distinct band at ~ 140 kDa in the VE - cadherin IP and VE - cadherin Western Blot lane ( second from right ) that is absent from the goat secondary antibody only control ( far right ) lane , suggesting that VE - cadherin immunoprecipitation was successful . This result confirms that the conditions used to immunoprecipiate VE - cadherin were sufficient to see a specific band on the Western Blot . Unfortunately , since the same antibody was used at the IP and Western Blot antibody , there is detection of the heavy and light ( not shown ) chains of the antibody as seen in the two far right lanes of Figure 5 . 8 . Given that VE - 100 cadherin is a high molecular weight protein , these bands do not interfere with the specific banding of VE - cadherin . Bead only IP controls were performed and do not result in any protein when either of the TMEM184A polyclonal antibodies were used ( data not shown ) . Two separate monoclonal antibodies against the heparin receptor were used ( 12B1 and 18E9 ) , both of which have been shown to be successful in mimicking the effects of heparin and blocking radiolabelled heparin binding ( Savage JM et al . 2001 and Patton WA et al . 1995 ) . As shown in Figure 5 . 8 ( left two columns ) , when 12B1 and 18E9 are used to IP the heparin receptor from BAOECs , specific bands are seen around the predicted molecular weight region ( ~ 52 kDa ) which are absent from secondary antibody only controls ( 2 Ab only – TMEM184A ( Rabbit ) lane ) , when the IP products were probed with commercial antibodies against TMEM184A - NTD and CTD . The intensity of the signal vary depending on which TMEM184A antibody was used , likely based on the specificity of the antibody under these conditions . The two polyclonal TMEM184A or secondary antibodies recognize a protein complex in the 52 kDa region of the VE - cadherin IP control ( left lanes of two left columns ) . This detection may be TMEM184A specifically , since VE - cadherin has well - defined links to actin , which could theoretically be involved in TMEM184A movement throughout the cytoplasm . However , it is clear that the monoclonal heparin receptor antibodies pulldown a protein which is then subsequently recognized by the TMEM184A antibodies , suggesting that TMEM184A could be the heparin receptor or , at the very least , complex with a protein that the monoclonal antibodies recognize . 101 Similar experiments were carried out with the BAOSMCs . In these experiments , insulin receptor substrate - 1 ( IRS - 1 ) was used as a control in place of VE - cadherin . In these experiments , the control ( IRS - 1 ) IP antibody and the Western Blot antibodies were both rabbit , so the heavy and light chains of the antibody were detected in the control lanes ( Figure 5 . 8B – left lanes of each column ) . However , the heparin receptor monoclonal antibodies are of mouse origin , so the protein seen in the 18B6 and 18H6 lanes is due to specific interaction with the IP product ( Figure 5 . 9 – right two lanes of each column ) , suggesting that TMEM184A recognizes the protein that is pulled down by the heparin receptor antibodies . The secondary only control lanes show the antibody heavy chain , the IRS - 1 lane , and a slight non - specific band in the 18B6 lane , suggesting that some of the detection may be due to non - specific secondary antibody recognition ( Figure 5 . 8B – far left column ) . Although there is a small amount of non - specific interaction , the specific detection is considerably more intesnse , suggesting that TMEM184A antibodies recognize immunoprecipitated heparin receptor . 5 . 3 . 8 : GFP - Tagged TMEM184A co - localizes with Rhodamine - heparin To further suggest that specific detection of TMEM184A is obtained through antibody staining and that TMEM184A is a receptor for heparin , GFP - TMEM184A was transfected into A7r5s and imaged in fixed cells . As shown in Figure 5 . 9A , GFP - TMEM184A localizes predominantly to two domains in A7r5s . GFP - TMEM184A clusters intensely at peri - nuclear regions and membrane patches ( Figure 5 . 9A ) . These locations agree with the patterns seen with antibody staining ( Figure 5 . 1 ) , strengthening the conclusions drawn from the antibody staining experiments . In order to support the 102 hypothesis that TMEM184A is a receptor for heparin , cells expressing GFP - TMEM184A were treated with Rhodamine - heparin . Extensive co - localization was evident between GFP - TMEM184A and Rhodamine - heparin at puncta throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 5 . 9B ) . Co - localization is shown in A7r5s treated with Rhodamine - heparin up to 5 min in Figure 5 . 9B , however similar co - localization can be seen up to at least 10 min and potentially even longer , though longer times have not been investigated ( data not shown ) . It also appears that cells which have internalized Rhodamin - heparin exhibit less characteristic surface staining , suggesting that TMEM184A on the surface was internalized with the labeled heparin ( Figure 5 . 9B ) . A7r5s expressing GFP - TMEM184A but not treated with Rhodamine - heparin were used as control and showed insignificant levels of red autofluorescence ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these results confirm the sub - cellular localization of TMEM184A in vascular smooth muscle cells and also provide another line of evidence supporting TMEM184A as a receptor for heparin . 5 . 3 . 9 : siRNA - mediated knockdown of TMEM184A decreases heparin sensitivity in A7r5s To further the IP data and the co - localization work showing that GFP - tagged TMEM84A co - localizes with Rhodamine - heparin , siRNA specific for rat TMEM184A was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology . Following the electroporation protocol described in the methods section of this chapter , transfection efficiencies of ~ 75 % were consistently obtained in the A7r5 cell line ( Figure 5 . 10A ) . As shown in Figure 5 . 10A , most cells exhibit fairly low levels of FITC - tagged scrambled control siRNA , suggesting that the electroporation protocol results in siRNA uptake by the cells . Even with the low 103 level of siRNA uptake , there does seem to be a significant effect on TMEM184A expression . As shown in Figure 5 . 10B , surface staining of TMEM184A is significantly decreased in TMEM184A siRNA - transfected cells relative to scrambled control siRNA - transfected cells . These data suggest that the TMEM184A siRNA decreases the amount of TMEM184A on the surface of cells , presumably decreasing a cell’s ability to bind and internalize heparin . In agreement with the surface decreases in TMEM184A siRNA - transfected cells , the internal staining of TMEM184A also seems to decrease relative to control siRNA - transfected cells that have been fixed and permeabilized ( Figure 5 . 10 and 5 . 11 ) . Because knockdown varied from experiment to experiment , knockdown levels are shown for each experimental sample along with staining for pERK or pElk - 1 . As shown in Figure 5 . 11A , TMEM184A staining is significantly reduced in TMEM184A siRNA - transfected cells relative to the same treatment in control siRNA - transfected cells . Control siRNA - transfected cells show a strong PDGF - induced increase in pElk - 1 relative to control , which is robustly attenuated by a 20 min heparin pretreatment prior to the 15 min PDGF treatment . ( Figure 5 . 11A – Control siRNA rows ) . PDGF induces a similar response in the TMEM184A siRNA - transfected cells , inducing a modest increase in pElk - 1 staining intensity ( Figure 5 . 11A – TMEM184A siRNA rows ) . When TMEM184A levels are decreased due to siRNA transfection , the heparin - induced attenuation of PDGF - induced pElk - 1 staining intensity is lost ( Figure 5 . 11A – TMEM184A siRNA rows ) . Stated differently , when TMEM184A levels are decreased , the cells are no longer as sensitive to heparin . These results suggest that TMEM184A is involved in mediating the heparin 104 responses in vascular smooth muscle cells potentially by serving as a receptor for heparin . In similar experiments , the effect of TMEM184A knockdown on PDGF - induced and heparin attenuation of ERK was investigated . Due to the experimental design and the need for unpermeabilized surface only staining controls ( Figure 5 . 10 ) , there are not untreated controls for the pERK studies ( Figure 5 . 11B ) . PDGF - induced ERK activity at 15 min is high , a finding which has been noted elsewhere ( Gilotti AC diss . 2000 and Savage JM et al . 2001 ) As shown in Figure 5 . 11B ( Control siRNA rows ) , a 20 min heparin treatment prior to a 15 min PDGF stimulation , greatly reduces active ERK in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus . The effect of heparin is again decreased in cells which have been transfected with TMEM184A siRNA ( Figure 5 . 11B – TMEM184A siRNA rows ) , suggesting that TMEM184A is needed for cells to be heparin sensitive . Taken together , the data indicate that decreasing TMEM184A expression results in decreased heparin sensitivity . In and of itself , these data do not prove that TMEM184A is a receptor for heparin ; but it does indicate that TMEM184A is involved in mediating heparin responses , presumably by acting as a receptor for heparin . To ensure that the electroporation / transfection process did not significantly affect protein expression in A7r5s ; scrambled Control siRNA - treated cells were also compared to cells which were not electroporated / transfected . These “untransfected” cells showed the same results as the control siRNA . The control siRNA had no effect on TMEM184A , pERK , or pElk - 1 overall expression or localization relative to untransfected cells . 105 5 . 3 . 10 : shRNA - mediated knockdown of TMEM184A in A7r5s As shown in Figure 5 . 12 , A7r5s were effectively electroporated with GFP - tagged control shRNA constructs and TMEM184A - specific shRNA constructs ( shRNA - B and C ) . In cells which expressed the GFP - tagged constructs , there was a significant reduction in TMEM184A - NTD staining on the surface of A7r5s that were not permeabilized , suggesting that the shRNA significantly decreased TMEM184A on the surface of cells ( Figure 5 . 12 ) . Although significant knock down was determined for surface TMEM184A , the differential levels of internal TMEM184A were not as great as the surface knock down . 5 . 4 : Discussion TMEM184A is a largely uncharacterized protein , identified through genome sequencing , which was thought to be limited in its expression to the germ line and exocrine cells , based on previous investigations ( Best D et al . 2008 and Best D and Adams IR 2009 ) . In order to gain a better understanding of TMEM184A and to potentially find a cell line in which I could overexpress TMEM184A , I sought to further characterize TMEM184A in a variety of cell types . I have shown that TMEM184A is present in vascular cells and a variety of primary and cloned cell lines , suggesting that it is expressed in a wider range of cells . In an attempt to examine TMEM184A function in vascular cells , co - localization with VAMP , cav - 1 , and eNOS was performed . TMEM184A co - localizes at peri - nuclear regions with VAMP , suggesting emerging roles in vesicle transport modulation in these cells types which is consistent with previous 106 findings in exocrine cells ( Best D and Adams IR 2009 ) . I also determined that TMEM184A is present at cav - 1 - enriched lipid rafts , presenting the possibility that TMEM184A may be involved in cell signaling events mediated by lipid rafts . In the case of vascular endothelial lipid rafts , cav - 1 is an important player in eNOS - mediated signaling events , and given TMEM184A presence , it may play a role in these signaling events as well . To this end , TMEM184A was also determined to co - localize with eNOS in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells . The fact that TMEM184A co - localizes with both eNOS and cav - 1 is not surprising given that eNOS and cav - 1 physically interact via the scaffolding domain of cav - 1 ( Garcia - Cardena G et al . 1997 and Ju H et al . 1997 ) . In this context cav - 1 has been shown to have an inhibitory role in preventing NO release because cav - 1 negatively regulates eNOS ( Michel JB et al . 1997 and Bucci M et al . 2000 ) . There have also been a large number of other proteins which have been established to localize to endothelial cell caveolae . These include receptor tyrosine kinases , G - protein coupled receptors and their subunits , TGFβ receptors , and calcium channels ( reviewed in : Sowa G 2012 ) . This suggests that TMEM184A , if proven to be the heparin receptor , could preferentially localize to caveolae in order to participate in the signaling hub located at caveolae lipid rafts . TMEM184A co - localization with eNOS further suggests that it utilizes the caveolae network . The co - localization of TMEM184A and VAMP is likely due to VAMP serving as a vesicle marker to assist in determining the final destination of the vesicle . Although physical interactions were not determined within the context of this dissertation , co - localization analysis suggests that TMEM184A could physically interact 107 with VAMP , cav - 1 , and / or eNOS or that they could be held in close proximity by a common protein complex . Suggested cav - 1 interaction sequences are common among many transmembrane proteins and appear to be found in putative transmembrane segments of TMEM184A . These segments may or may not be critical for cav - 1 interactions with other proteins but if they are , it appears that TMEM184A has these sequences available for interaction with cav - 1 ( Byrne DP , Dart C , and Rigden DJ 2012 ) . Despite the probability of interaction , immunoprecipitation of TMEM184A - NTD did not appear to pull down cav - 1 ( data not shown ) . To gain an understanding of whether TMEM184A localizes to the membrane for a period of time , cells were fixed with 4 % PFA but not permeabilized with Triton - X - 100 . Admittedly , this method of looking at cell surface staining is imperfect , because cells are permeabilized slightly in the process , even though the PFA did not contain methanol . In most cases , an antibody for a cytoplasmic protein was included in the cell surface staining experiments , to show that the cells were not permeabilized enough for significant cytoplasmic staining . In a large percentage of the experiments , staining of the cytoplasmic protein was faint and altered from its traditional staining pattern , providing convincing evidence that the cells were not permeabilized significantly ( data not shown ) . In agreement with these results , the staining pattern of TMEM184A was altered in a way which no longer showed peri - nuclear staining , suggesting that the cells were not appreciably permeabilized . Secondary antibody only controls were also done to confirm that the TMEM184A surface staining was specific . Despite the imperfections in the technique , it was the only technique readily available to look at cell surface staining , and 108 did provide a consistent representation of TMEM184A on the cell surface . These data suggest that TMEM184A does remain on the cell surface for a period of time as well as localizing to peri - nuclear regions , again supporting the hypothesis that TMEM184A could function as a receptor for heparin . It has also been shown that cells which possess TMEM184A also internalize labeled heparin . Unfortunately , the Rhodamine - heparin uptake assays require cells to not be permeabilized making co - localization studies of Rhodamine - heparin and native TMEM184A virtually impossible . Co - localization of surface TMEM184A ( staining in unpermeabilized cells ) and Rhodamine - heparin can be done , but typically does not yield appreciable co - localization likely due to washing off of Rhodamine - heparin from surface interactions during rinsing and fixation . This hypothesis is supported by the fact that most Rhodamine - heparin is seen in small to large puncta in the cytoplasm and does not resemble surface staining seen with TMEM184A . Comparing TMEM184A staining seen in Figure 5 . 1B and 5 . 2B with Rhodamine - heparin uptake in Figure 5 . 7 , there is potential that TMEM184A and Rhodamine - heparin would co - localize in the cells investigated . The clearest example of this is the MEF cell line which noticeably exhibits Rhodamine - heparin signal near nuclei , which is where TMEM184A - NTD is predominantly localized . Although not entirely convincing , these data support and do not disprove TMEM184A as the heparin receptor . Due to the above experimental limitations of staining for TMEM184A and looking for co - localization with Rhodamine - heparin , a GFP - tagged construct was obtained for these experiments . Although , it is debatable whether or not the 109 GFP tag will disrupt the orientation of TMEM184A in the membrane , it can still be used to determine sub - cellular localization and co - localization with Rhodamine - heparin . GFP - TMEM184A is expressed at fairly high levels in A7r5s where it localizes to peri - nuclear regions and membrane patches ( Figure 5 . 9A ) . Given that the TMEM184A antibodies were polyclonal antibodies which have the potential to detect proteins of similar sequence to TMEM184A , it was determined that exogenous expression of TMEM184A would only strengthen the conclusions drawn from antibody staining . The GFP - TMEM184A was found at intense peri - nuclear regions with virtually no staining in what appears to be the nuclei , something that was occasionally an artifact seen with antibody staining . GFP - TMEM184A also localized to patches at the membrane , further supporting the role of TMEM184A as a transmembrane protein , which could be accessible on the surface of the cells for heparin binding . Cells expressing GFP - TMEM184A were also treated with Rhodamine - heparin to investigate if the two co - localize . Internalized Rhodamine - heparin in A7r5s typically occurs as intense puncta throughout the cytoplasm , presumably representing internalized vesicles . Co - localization between GFP - TMEM184A and Rhodamine - heparin is evident in most cells as far out in time as I’ve investigated . The co - localization experiments provide yet another line of evidence that TMEM184A functions as a receptor for heparin . However , it is possible that TMEM184A is involved in intracellular transport and that is why co - localization is seen . Albeit plausible , considering all of the data indicating that TMEM184A functions as a receptor for heparin , it seems more likely that TMEM184A is functioning as a receptor for heparin . 110 To initially characterize TMEM184A as the heparin receptor , immunoprecipitations were performed using the lab’s monoclonal heparin receptor antibodies , which mimic the effects of heparin and block radiolabelled heparin binding ( Savage JM et al . 2001 , Patton WA et al . 1995 ) . Under the IP conditions described in the methods section of this chapter , the monoclonal antibodies were able to IP a protein which was recognized by the TMEM184A antibodies in both BAOECs and BAOSMCs . These data suggest that either TMEM184A is the heparin receptor or that TMEM184A interacts with a protein that is the heparin receptor . Although the IP data suggest that TMEM184A recognizes immunoprecipitated heparin receptor , the controls for these experiments are not as clean as desired . This is likely due to a variety of factors including the polyclonal nature of the TMEM184A antibodies and a small degree of non - specific secondary antibody interaction . Taking into consideration the mass spec data collected by Raymond Pugh , there is fairly convincing evidence that TMEM184A is the heparin receptor . Raymond’s data showed that he was able to isolate protein using the same monoclonal antibodies for sequence analysis , demonstrating that the isolated protein shared significant sequence similarity with TMEM184A . Combining the proteomic data with the IP data discussed in this chapter , provides convincing evidence that TMEM184A is the heparin receptor or at least part of a heparin receptor complex . However , other members of the Lowe - Krentz have documented that other proteins do not co - IP with the heparin receptor ( Patton WA et al . 1995 and Savage JM et al . 2001 ) . In order to further suggest that TMEM184A is the heparin receptor , functional assays need to be completed . To do this , there are two options . The first option is to 111 exogenously over - express TMEM184A in cells which do not possess or possess significantly less TMEM184A and determine increased heparin sensitivity . The second option is to knock down the levels of endogenous TMEM184A using siRNA or shRNA in a cell line known to possess TMEM814A and determine sensitivity to heparin . I have decided that the first option ( exogenous over - expression ) is not a feasible route to provide a functional link between heparin sensitivity and TMEM184A . This conclusion is based on the fact that all cells that have been investigated possess TMEM184A at high levels and bind / internalize labeled heparin , even though the cells have not been documented in the literature to be heparin sensitive . These facts suggest that all cells have TMEM184A and / or a receptor for heparin allowing them to internalize labeled heparin but lack the downstream signaling components necessary for heparin signaling to occur . Therefore my hypothesis is that over - expressing exogenous TMEM184A in these cells which already have the protein will not make them heparin sensitive in any way that has been documented or can be measured experimentally . However , the GFP - tagged TMEM184A did partly fulfill this line of evidence detailed above . Again , the second method to functionally link TMEM184A to heparin sensitivity is to knock down TMEM184A using siRNA or shRNA and look for altered heparin sensitivity . It is my belief that this is the most effective way to link TMEM184A to heparin sensitivity , given the issues discussed with exogenous over - expression . The data collected using targeted siRNA suggests that a modest decrease of TMEM184A has been consistently achieved in the A7r5 cell line . The decrease in TMEM184A staining is very modest , but is sufficient to alter the cells’ response to heparin as shown by pERK and 112 pElk - 1 staining . Under normal conditions , both pERK and pElk - 1 are strongly induced by 15 min of PDGF stimulation and a 20 min pre - treatment of heparin is sufficient to decrease this response by about half . When TMEM184A siRNA is incorporated and the cells have been verified to show moderately decreased TMEM184A staining , the cells are less responsive to heparin pre - treatment . In siRNA - treated cells , the heparin - induced decreases are absent or significantly less than seen with control cells . The degree to which cells lose their heparin sensitivity is in line with the efficacy of TMEM184A knockdown . These data suggest that TMEM184A functionally acts as a receptor for heparin , because when TMEM184A levels are even moderately decreased , heparin sensitivity is decreased . The trends seen in the siRNA experiments agree with the hypothesis that TMEM184A is a receptor for heparin . However , I believe that only modest decreases are going to be obtainable using siRNA , due to the fact that the cells need to be exposed to siRNA for a minimum of 72 hours to even see a decrease in TMEM184A staining . It is likely that during this long time frame , the siRNA is degraded and loses its potency . Since TMEM184A is a membrane protein , presumably with fairly slow turnover , long exposure to siRNA is required to achieve any decreases in TMEM184A levels . For these reasons and to obtain better knockdown of TMEM184A , shRNA constructs were obtained . The shRNA constructs should be more effective over longer periods of time in knocking down TMEM184A protein levels , allowing a more clear interpretation of lost heparin sensitivity in cells expressing less TMEM184A . 113 In an attempt to achieve better knock down of TMEM184A in the A7r5 cell line and to support the siRNA data , shRNA constructs specific for TMEM184A were obtained . The results from these experiments suggest that two of the five constructs ( shRNA - B and C ) were significantly better at decreasing the level of TMEM184A on the surface of cells . However , only surface TMEM184A was significantly reduced by the shRNA constructs . Internal staining for TMEM184A was only marginally decreased by the specific shRNA compared to untransfected cells or control shRNA transfected cells . This along with the GFP - TMEM184A localization primarily to the membrane suggests that newly synthesized TMEM184A is transported to the membrane and remains there . Both shRNA and siRNA decrease the amount of newly synthesized protein which would likely be the TMEM184A associated with the membrane . Since both silencing mechanisms only decrease internal staining modestly , this suggests that TMEM184A is not readily recycled , although the mechanism and meaning behind this lack of recycling is unclear . In the future these shRNA construct can be used to create stable cell lines which constitutively express decreased TMEM184A . This could potentially increase the success of long - term decreases in TMEM184A which may be necessary to decrease both surface and internal levels . The fact that GFP - tagged TMEM184A co - localizes with Rhodamine - heparin and the TMEM184A siRNA data do not prove that TMEM184A functions as a receptor for heparin , rather they suggest that TMEM184A is involved in mediating heparin signaling . The culmination of work completed by Raymond Pugh , using protein biochemistry and mass spec analysis suggested that TMEM184A shared significant sequence similarity to 114 the protein isolated using monoclonal antibodies against the heparin receptor . Combining Raymond’s data with the IP data , co - localization data , and the siRNA data strongly supports the hypothesis that TMEM184A does , in fact , function as a receptor for heparin . 115 5 . 5 : Figures Figure 5 . 1 : TMEM184A is expressed in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells ( A ) Whole cell lysates were harvested in sample buffer , immunoblotted for TMEM184A - NTD , compared to corresponding secondary antibody only controls , and migration of colored molecular weight markers .

As mentioned previously , smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic vasculature exit their quiescent state and enter a proliferative state . Progression through the cell cycle is driven primarily by the interaction of cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDKs ) and their regulatory subunits , the cyclins . Cyclin - CDK complexes induce the activation of transcription factors , ultimately resulting in progression through the cell cycle , cell growth , and cell proliferation ( Fouty BW et al . 2001 ) . Looking specifically at the G 1 - S transition , important cyclin - CDK complexes include cyclin D - CDK4 / 6 and cyclin E - CDK2 , which are involved in phosphorylating and inactivating the Rb ( retinoblastoma ) protein , an inhibitor of E2F ( Yu L et al . 2006 and Fouty BW et al . 2001 ) . Once phosphorylated Rb dissociates from E2F , allowing E2F to carry out its function of inducing transcription of genes responsible for cell proliferation ( Figure 6 . 1 ) ( Yu L et al . 2006 and Fouty BW et al . 2001 ) . There are multiple levels of regulation over the cell cycle , including the expression of phase - specific cyclins , which are degraded when no longer necessary . An additional level of regulation is a class of negative regulators of cyclin - CDK complexes , CDK inhibitors ( CDKIs ) , which inhibit the phosphorylation of specific cyclin - CDK complexes ( Yu L et al . 2006 and Fouty BW et al . 2001 ) . By inhibiting cyclin - CDK complexes , CDKIs can be considered anti - proliferative , because they block progression through the cell cycle . CDKIs are broken into two families , the INK4 family ( p15 , p16 , p18 , p19 ) and the Cip / Kip family ( p21 , p27 , and p57 ) ( Yu L et al . 2006 ) . The INK4 132 family of CDKIs is known to inhibit cyclin D - CDK4 / 6 complexes , while the Cip / Kip family of CDKIs is known to inhibit cyclin E - CDK2 and cyclin D - CDK4 / 6 complexes ( Yu L et al . 2006 ) . Regardless of cyclin - CDK complex inhibited , both families block the phosphorylation of Rb , maintaining E2F bound Rb , and preventing cell cycle progression and subsequent growth and proliferation ( Figure 6 . 1 ) ( Yu L et al . 2006 and Fouty BW et al . 2001 ) . Figure 6 . 1 : Regulation of the G 1 to S cell cycle transition ( Adapted from Yu L et al . 2006 ) As discussed previously , heparin has been shown to have anti - inflammatory characteristics in cells of the vasculature . In VSMCs , heparin exerts an anti - proliferative effect via at least two mechanisms . The two primary mechanisms include the regulation of MAPK cascade intermediates ( Yu L et al . 2006 ) , which are involved in cell growth and proliferation and by imposing a cell cycle block at the G 1 phase through up - regulation or down regulation of specific genes and proteins necessary for the transition from the G 1 to S phase ( Reilly CF et al . 1989 , Fasciano S et al . 2005 , Vadiveloo , PK et al . 1997 ) . This cell cycle block can be at least partially explained by an increase in heparin - 133 induced MKP - 1 increase resulting in less active ERK and decreased cell proliferation ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 and Dickinson RJ and Keyse SM 2006 ) . Along with inducing MKP - 1 protein synthesis , heparin also down - regulates Raf activity , a kinase upstream of ERK , by inhibiting its phosphorylation ( Pukac LA et al . 1997 , Dhillon AS et al . 2007 , and Slee JB , Pugh R , Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . Along with regulation of MAPK kinase cascade intermediates , it has been reported that heparin treatment causes rapid down - regulation of mRNA levels of genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation , including c - fos , c - jun , myb , and myc , again decreasing cellular proliferation in VSMCs ( Mishra - Gorur K and Castellot JJ , 1999 ) . The second mechanism through which heparin exerts its anti - proliferative effects in VSMCs is by imposing a cell cycle block at the G 1 phase ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 , Vadiveloo PK et al . 1997 , Reilly CF et al . 1989 ) . Most smooth muscle cells in the adult vascular system are in a quiescent state , typically arrested in the G 0 or G 1 phases of the cell cycle . VSMCs in atherosclerotic plaques are highly proliferative and migratory , accounting for large portion of the plaque mass ( Ross R 1993 and Ross R 1999 ) . Research has shown that heparin strongly down - regulates the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein , cdk2 mRNA , and cdc2 protein to achieve this cell cycle block ( Vadiveloo PK et al . 1997 ) . One CDKI up - regulated by heparin treatment is p27 kip1 . This accumulated p27 kip1 protein level prevents the activation of Cdk2 , blocking S phase entry ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 , Yu L et al . 2006 , and Fouty BW et al . 2001 ) . Fasciano S and colleagues ( 2005 ) noted that heparin treatment did not affect p27 kip1 mRNA levels at 12 and 18 hr of treatment , suggesting that heparin is mediating this affect post - 134 transcriptionally by stabilizing p27 kip1 protein . The post - transcriptional regulation of p27 kip1 raises the possibility that heparin could be regulating other genes in this manner rather than solely regulating gene expression . MKP - 1 activity has been shown by our lab to be up - regulated by heparin treatment leading to decreased ERK activity and thereby decreased cell proliferation ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . Additional unpublished data from our lab suggests that MKP - 1 gene transcription occurs in response to heparin treatment . Treatment of smooth muscle cells with actinomyosin D and / or doxorubicin both of which block transcription , block MKP - 1 synthesis . Other unpublished data suggest that blocking translation blocks the heparin - induced MKP - 1 increase . These observations suggest that both transcription and translation are necessary to get the increase in MKP - 1 in response to heparin treatment , but do not rule out transcript stability or sequestration . Therefore , the targeted RT - PCR , PCR arrays , and microarray analyses all included MKP - 1 to determine if heparin up - regulated DUSP1 / MKP - 1 gene expression Although much of the literature focuses on exogenous heparin treatment for therapeutic benefit , endogenous heparan sulfates also possess anti - proliferative properties in VSMCs . Along with exogenous heparin ; certain endogenous heparan sulfates are anti - proliferative . Both endogenous perlecan and syndecan - 1 inhibit VSMC proliferation ( Kinsella MG et al . 2003 and Fukai N et al . 2009 ) , and perlecan has been shown to sequester FGF2 from binding to its receptor ( Tran PK et al . 2004 ) . The anti - proliferative effects of heparin / heparin sulfates are summarized in Figure 6 . 2 ( reviewed in : Slee JB , Pugh R , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . 135 Figure 6 . 2 : Data from the literature indicate that exogenous heparin and endogenous heparan sulfates are anti - proliferative in VSMCs ( Adapted from : Slee JB , Pugh R , Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) Given the trend for potential heparin - induced gene expression changes , I aimed to investigate global gene expression ( microarray ) , pathway specific gene expression ( PCR arrays ) and targeted gene expression ( RT - PCR ) . Using these three techniques , I have identified many genes which are regulated by heparin , expanded our understanding of heparin - induced MKP - 1 activity , and determined that two CDKI genes are not regulated by heparin treatment . The PCR arrays and targeted RT - PCR analyses also served to validate three genes from the microarray . 136 6 . 2 : Methods 6 . 2 . 1 : Cell Culture A7r5s and RAOSMCs were used for gene expression analyses . For RT - PCR , PCR Arrays , and microarray analysis cells were grown to approximately 70 - 80 % confluency , to ensure that cells were still in a proliferative state . In some experiments cells were synchronized via serum starvation for 2 days prior to experimentation . In these cases , cells were rinsed with EDTA prior to serum starvation to remove any remaining serum from the culture medium and fresh serum - free media was added . 6 . 2 . 2 : Heparin Treatment for PCR Arrays 100 mm dishes of proliferative A7r5s ( not synchronized via starvation ) were used as starting material for PCR array analysis . Cells were treated with 200 µg / ml heparin for a single time point of 30 min and harvested according to the RNA isolation protocol outlined in Appendix I . 6 . 2 . 3 : Heparin and Serum Treatment for Short - Term RT - PCR 100 mm dishes of A7r5s were synchronized via starvation for 2 – 3 days and used as starting material for RT - PCR analysis . Cells were treated with 200 μg / ml heparin for 20 min prior to 10 % serum addition . Serum incubation varied from 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30 min durations to optimize serum induction . RNA was isolated using the isolation protocol outlined in Appendix I . 6 . 2 . 4 : Heparin Treatment for Long - Term Microarray Analysis 100 mm dishes of RAOSMCs were used as starting material for microarray analysis . RAOSMCs were kept in fully supplemented MEM media to allow for 137 microarray analysis of the effects of heparin in proliferative cells . Once the cells reached ~ 70 - 80 % confluency , cells were treated with 200 μg / ml heparin for 24 hr and RNA was isolated using the protocol outlined in Appendix I . 6 . 2 . 5 : SDS - PAGE and Western Blotting In many cases , a Western Blot experiment was run in parallel to gene expression analysis to ensure the cells were heparin sensitive . In these instances , the experimental design was identical up to isolation of total RNA or protein . If the cells demonstrated heparin sensitivity , as indicated by heparin - induced decreases in pERK band intensity relative to control and serum only bands , then the experiment was allowed to proceed . SDS - PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described in Chapter 2 using the alkaline phosphatase detection method . 6 . 2 . 6 : RNA Isolation and Processing The methodology for RNA isolation , reverse transcription , RNA quality control , RT - PCR experimental set - up , cycling conditions , and PCR array analysis are described in Appendix I . In all cases ( RT - PCR analysis , PCR arrays , and microarray ) RNA was isolated from 100 mm dishes of A7r5s or RAOSMCs using the Qiagen RNeasy total RNA isolation kit with the optional on - column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol . For the RT - PCR and microarray analysis , reverse transcription was carried out using Invitrogen’s SuperScript III First - Strand Synthesis Super Mix according to Invitrogen’s recommended protocol . For PCR arrays , reverse transcription was done using SABiosciences reverse transcription reagents according to their protocol . 138 6 . 2 . 7 : RT - PCR Data Analysis ( 2 - ΔΔCT ) RT - PCR data was analyzed using fold change relative to GAPDH control . To calculated fold change : First calculate ΔC T from raw C T within a time point and replicate ( C T DUSP1 – C T GAPDH ) . Average ΔC T value of control ( DUSP1 ) across replicates , then calculate ΔΔC T using this average control ΔC T of DUSP1 ( ΔC T DUSP1 EXPERIMENTAL – ΔC T DUSP1 CONTROL ) . Use this value to calculate fold change ( 2 - ΔΔCT ) . Fold change values were averaged and statistics were run across triplicates . 6 . 2 . 8 : Microarray Analysis Total RNA was isolated from RAOSMCs and quality was determined as described in Appendix I . Once total RNA was determined to be of high quality and yield , it was sent to Genome Explorations ( Memphis , TN ) , an authorized service provider of Affymetrix microarrays . The Affymetrix GeneChip® Rat Gene 1 . 0 ST Array was used to determine heparin - induced gene expression in proliferative RAOSMCs treated with heparin for 24 hr relative to untreated control . Additional quality control measures were completed by Genome Explorations prior to RNA amplification , tagging , and hybridization . Genome Explorations performed all data analysis and provided a data package including significant gene changes , clusters of regulated genes , regulated pathways , as well as all of the raw data . 139 6 . 3 : Results 6 . 3 . 1 : PCR Array data suggests that only a few of the selected genes are regulated by heparin All genes investigated in the PCR arrays are listed in Appendices II and III . Two separate PCR arrays were performed , one representing genes from the MAPK signaling cascade ( Figure 6 . 3 ) and one representing genes from the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) signaling cascades ( Figure 6 . 4 ) . The PCR arrays were formatted for gene expression analysis in 96 well plates . Necessary controls account for six of those wells , leaving 90 genes for analysis . Since two PCR arrays were used , this allowed for the analysis of 180 genes that were picked based largely on known heparin signaling pathways . The results of both microarrays seem to suggest that heparin treatment for 30 min does not regulate a significant number of genes , since only 8 of the 180 ( ~ 4 . 4 % ) genes tested were heparin sensitive . These genes include MAPK10 ( JNK3 ) – increased 2 . 07 and 1 . 63 fold , KCNH8 – decreased 2 . 54 fold , PDGFRA – decreased 5 . 94 fold , EGF – decreased 2 . 54 fold ( Figure 6 . 1 ) , MAP4K1 ( kinase upstream of ERK ) – increased 2 . 31 fold , MAPK13 ( p38Δ ) – increased 3 . 61 fold , CDKN1C ( p57 kip2 ) – increased 2 . 29 fold , and MAPK8ip2 ( JIP1 ) – increased 3 . 07 fold ( Figures 6 . 3 and 6 . 4 ) . More importantly than what the PCR array data showed as regulated by heparin was what they showed that was not regulated by heparin . These two arrays were chosen because they contained a number of cell cycle regulatory proteins . The data suggest that very few of the cell cycle regulatory proteins ( cyclins , CDKs , and CDKIs ) were regulated by heparin under these conditions . These results suggest that at shorter time points ( less 140 than 30 min ) , heparin does not regulate mRNA level changes but possibly protein stability as seen with p27 kip1 ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . 6 . 3 . 2 : PCR Array data and targeted RT - PCR data suggest that heparin does not regulate MKP - 1 by control of mRNA levels Of particular interest in the EGF / PDGF PCR array was the DUSP1 gene , which codes for MKP - 1 protein . In fact , this array was chosen because it included DUSP1 . As previously discussed , MKP - 1 activity is up - regulated in response to heparin treatment and other data collected from the lab suggest that MKP - 1 mRNA levels would be a good candidate to be regulated by heparin . However , the DUSP1 PCR array sample showed an insignificant fold change ( - 1 . 25 ) relative to untreated control , suggesting that DUSP1 mRNA level is not regulated by heparin . To further investigate and to validate the PCR array data , targeted gene expression analyses were performed for DUSP1 using Qiagen’s SYBR green chemistry and RotorGene RT - PCR equipment . Two representative graphs are shown in Figure 6 . 5 . The results consistently suggest that DUSP1 mRNA level is not regulated by heparin , as shown by fold change values which are not significantly different from control nor significantly different among or within treatment groups . Taken together , these data suggest that DUSP1 gene expression is not regulated by heparin and it is likely the case that heparin regulates DUSP1 protein stability as seen with other heparin - sensitive proteins ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . Considering previous data collected by other lab members , it appears that continued MKP - 1 synthesis and protein stability are required for heparin - induced MKP1 - 1 activity , but increased DUSP1 expression is not required . 141 6 . 3 . 3 : Microarray data agrees with PCR Array and targeted RT - PCR analyses of DUSP1 , CDKN1B ( p27 kip1 ) , and CDKN1C ( p57 kip2 ) The microarray data obtained from Genome Explorations support the data collected from the PCR arrays and targeted RT - PCR analyses on DUSP1 and CDKN1B . The targeted RT - PCR analyses of CDKN1B consistently resulted in fold change values less than 1 . 5 fold across 10 , 20 , and 30 min of heparin treatment , suggesting that CDKN1B gene expression is not regulated by heparin , agreeing with previously published reports ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . The C T values from the microarray for CDKN1B were 11 . 43 vs . 11 . 27 ( control vs . heparin ) suggesting an extremely small fold change value ( which is not reported by Genome Explorations due to this fact ) . The targeted RT - PCR data for DUSP1 is shown in Figure 6 . 5 , which is similar to the data obtained from the microarray ( control : 12 . 95 vs . heparin 13 . 15 ) , further suggesting that DUSP1 mRNA is not regulated by heparin . A third gene was investigated to validate the PCR array and microarray data . CDKN1C ( p57 kip1 ) was shown to be significantly increased by 2 . 29 fold in the MAPK PCR array but was not included in the EGF / PDGF PCR array . Therefore , targeted RT - PCR was performed with primers specific for CDKN1C . The results obtained from these studies consistently yielded fold change values less than 1 . 5 fold , which was considered to be a non - significant fold increase ( data not shown ) . The experiment was carried out as done for DUSP1 ( results shown in Figure 6 . 5 ) and resulted in the similar non - significant fold change values within experimental groups . The C T values from the microarray 142 ( control : 8 . 57 vs . heparin : 8 . 61 ) agree with the data collected from the RT - PCR analyses , suggesting that CKDN1C mRNA levels are not regulated by heparin treatment . It is important to note that there was an experimental difference in the microarray compared to the PCR arrays and RT - PCR analyses . The microarray was performed in proliferative RAOSMCs treated with 200 µg / ml heparin for 24 hr . The PCR arrays were performed in proliferative A7r5s treated with 200 µg / ml heparin for 30 min . In the targeted RT - PCR analyses , A7r5s were treated with the same concentration of heparin for 20 min in cells synchronized by starvation and serum stimulated for times less than 30 min . The experiments were carried out in this was for multiple reasons . First , the PCR arrays and RT - PCR analyses were carried out first , leading me to believe that shorter time points may not be sufficient to see significant gene expression changes , given that very few genes changed . Second , I wanted to keep the PCR arrays and microarray as simple as possible to avoid inclusion of variables that could confound post - hoc data analysis . Third , I switched from the A7r5 cloned rat line to primary RAOSMCs to avoid any issues stemming from using a cloned line for gene expression work . Regardless of the differences in experimental design , all three techniques yielded similar results . Heparin does not regulate DUSP1 , CDKN1B , or CDKN1C mRNA levels . The data from the microarray showed that mRNA levels of these three genes did not significantly change in heparin - treated cells ( C T values : DUSP1 – control : 12 . 95 vs . heparin : 13 . 15 , CDKN1B – control : 11 . 43 vs . heparin : 11 . 27 , and CDKN1C – control : 8 . 57 vs . heparin : 8 . 61 ) . Taken together , the data suggest that heparin does not regulate the mRNA levels of these genes , but instead could regulate protein stability , protein turnover , 143 or translation . It is likely that heparin regulates the stability of these transcripts or proteins via a similar mechanism which was shown for p27 kip1 ( CDKN1B ) ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . 6 . 3 . 4 : Microarray data suggest heparin up - regulates gene expression Given the colossal nature of the microarray data , all of the raw data cannot be included in this dissertation . Instead , I’ve organized the data in a few logical ways . First , I’ve included flow charts highlighting pathways that were regulated ( Figure 6 . 6 A , B , and C ) . Second , I’ve listed all of the pathways that contained at least 2 genes that were significantly regulated ( Table 6 . 1 ) . Lastly , I’ve listed all genes with a fold change of ≥ 1 . 5 which have also been identified by Genome Explorations as significant fold change values ( Table 6 . 2 ) . Having the data organized in these ways should provide an overview of heparin - induced gene expression changes at the pathway level and provide detailed analysis of selected individual genes within those pathways . This should provide a broad view of heparin - induced gene expression changes and leave room for discussion of select heparin - sensitive genes . As shown in Figure 6 . 6 , I’ve highlighted what Genome Explorations called biological processes ( A ) , molecular functions ( B ) , and cellular components ( C ) that were regulated by heparin . Only a small subset of the significantly regulated pathways are highlighted within each grouping . Within Biological processes , 10 genes were regulated that are involved in blood circulation , three of which are involved in blood vessel remodeling ( Figure 6 . 6A ) . The largest grouping of regulated genes was in the cell surface receptor signaling family , in which 29 genes were regulated ( Figure 6 . 6A ) . Interestingly , 144 the last group within biological processes contained three genes that were responsive to laminar fluid shear stress , helping to connect my fluid shear stress project with heparin regulation . As shown in Figure 6 . 6B , a small subset of molecular functions were regulated by heparin and included receptor serine / threonine kinase binding and endopeptidase inhibitor activity . This section seems to suggest that only a small number of peptidase inhibitors were regulated by heparin and this is in fact not true . There were a large number of peptidases and peptidase inhibitors that were significantly regulated by heparin . Lastly , as shown in Figure 6 . 6C , a small subset of cellular components were regulated and they include proteinacaeous extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components and integrin complexes . Having the data organized in this way highlights three pathways that were significantly regulated by heparin . These three , however , only represent a small fraction of the pathways that were identified as significantly responsive to a 24 hr heparin treatment . To dig deeper into the data , all signaling pathways / clusters with 2 or more genes that were heparin responsive are listed in Table 6 . 1 . The pathway with the largest number of regulated genes ( 16 ) was the integrin family of cell surface interactions . This is followed by a variety of receptor mediated signaling pathways with 12 genes each ( S1PI , PDGFR - beta , EGF receptor , and the LKB1 - AMPK signaling pathways . These are only four of about 70 or so pathways that were identified as having significant heparin regulated gene expression occurring within their intermediates . There is also a variety of other pathways that are significantly regulated by heparin that bear mentioning . These include EGF receptor internalization and downstream signaling , protein inhibitor up - 145 regulation , proteoglycan signaling , TGFBR , and cell surface interactions with the vessel wall . This way of analyzing the data goes slighter deeper , still does not get us to specific genes , but suggests that heparin is involved in the regulation of many pathways and genes . To further explore the microarray data , all genes which exhibited a fold change of ≥ 1 . 5 are shown in Table 6 . 2 . Genome Explorations uses algorithms to predict fold changes above 1 . 0 to be significant , so I took it a step further and set the cut - off for significance to be a fold change of 1 . 5 . This however does not imply that these fold changes are biologically scientific , nor are they statistically significant . These fold changes appear to be significant within this microarray data set , as defined by Genome Explorations . Performing the analysis in this way provides a list of about 80 genes that are heparin sensitive . Included in this set are four separate serine or cysteine peptidase inhibitors , integrin alpha 7 , oxidized low density lipoprotein ( lectin - like ) receptor 1 , and guanylate cyclase 1 soluble beta 3 . There were two genes that were most strongly induced by heparin treatment ; these were the regulator of G - protein signaling 4 and asporin , fold change of 3 . 039 and 3 . 853 respectively . Also consistent with the data obtained from the PCR arrays , the majority of gene expression altered by heparin was through up - regulation instead of down - regulation . Using ≥ 1 . 5 fold change as the cut - off , only one gene was significantly down - regulated by heparin treatment for 24 hr . Given the trend of heparin significantly up - regulating genes , the genes that were down - regulated by heparin were omitted from the data set and will not be discussed in this dissertation . It is also true that none of these down - regulated 146 proteins have established or related signaling pathways which have been linked to heparin signaling . Taken together , the gene expression analysis data suggest that heparin regulates quite a large number of genes mostly through up - regulation and that heparin may also regulate protein stability of certain proteins involved in heparin signaling . 6 . 4 : Discussion Although the microarray was performed last chronologically in this dissertation , the PCR array data and targeted RT - PCR data can be used to validate the microarray . The MAPK and EGF / PDGF PCR arrays were performed to gather preliminary data to ensure that pursuing heparin - induced gene expression changes were worthwhile . These arrays provided evidence of enough gene regulation to suggest that further analysis was necessary . Although an educated guess was made that the MAPK and EGF / PDGF arrays would produce the largest number of regulated genes , this was in fact not the case . These arrays produced only 8 genes that were significantly altered by a 30 min heparin treatment . However , these arrays did investigate three genes of interest for this dissertation . As mentioned in the results section , these genes were DUSP1 ( MKP - 1 ) , CDKN1B ( p27 kip1 ) , and CDKN1C ( p57 kip2 ) , all of which were good candidates for heparin regulation . MKP - 1 activity has been shown by our lab to be up - regulated by heparin treatment leading to decreased ERK activity and thereby decreased cell proliferation ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . Additional unpublished evidence from our lab suggested that MKP - 1 gene transcription was occurring in response to heparin treatment , but could 147 not rule out transcript stability or sequestration . As discussed previously , these unpublished data included the observation that actinomyosin D and doxorubicin ( chemicals which block transcription ) block DUSP1 synthesis and the observation that blocking translation also blocks the heparin - induced MKP - 1 increase . These observations along with the fact that MKP - 1 has a very short half - life suggest that both transcription and translation are necessary to get the increase in MKP - 1 in response to heparin treatment , but do not rule out transcript stability or sequestration . The collection of MKP - 1 data from this dissertation strongly support a model where DUSP1 / MKP - 1 mRNA is not regulated by heparin . The lack of heparin - induced changes in mRNA levels were consistently shown across three different methods of assaying heparin - induced gene expression changes . The DUSP1 / MKP - 1 mRNA data collected herein ; do not disagree with the unpublished data collected by other lab members , rather suggest that continued basal DUSP1 gene expression and some level of protein stabilization is required for the heparin - induced MKP - 1 activity increases . CDKN1B ( p27 kip1 ) was investigated as a gene for potential heparin regulation because it has been documented to be regulated by heparin . Previous reports have shown that heparin regulates p27 kip1 transcript stability beyond 18 hr of heparin treatment ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . However , I initially hypothesized that 18 hr of heparin treatment would be too long and immediate gene changes would be missed . The rationale behind this hypothesis is based on unpublished data showing that heparin - induced decreases in pERK and increases in MKP - 1 can be seen as early as 10 min . These observations suggest that the signaling intermediates downstream of heparin react very quickly to 148 heparin treatment . Therefore , early mRNA level changes induced by heparin were investigated for CDKN1B . Although built upon sound science , the original hypothesis was not supported . Rather the data indicate that changes in transcription for these genes are not induced by heparin . All three methods of assaying gene expression performed in this dissertation failed to show significant heparin - induced changes in CDKN1B gene expression . Regardless of whether cells were synchronized via starvation , were proliferative , treated with heparin for ≤ 30 min , or treated with heparin for 24 hr , no changes were observed . These findings do not conflict with the published report or the unpublished observations listed above . Rather it supports the case for CDKN1B to be regulated primarily by transcript accessibility over long - term heparin treatment ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . The data showing that CDKN1B gene expression is not changed by 30 min or less of heparin treatment , suggests that if CDKN1B is involved in heparin - induced anti - proliferative effects in VSMCs it is through a mechanism enhancing the usage of existing transcript or protein stability . The preliminary PCR arrays provided a second CDKI of potential interest for heparin regulation , CDKN1C ( p57 kip2 ) , a member of the same family as CDKN1B ( p27 kip1 ) , although no published evidence links CDKN1C and heparin signaling . This provided a candidate anti - proliferative gene whose transcription might be quickly increased by short - term heparin treatment , which could help to explain the fast heparin - induced alterations in pERK and MKP - 1 . Therefore , CDKN1C was selected for further analysis via targeted RT - PCRs . However , this hypothesis was not supported , because the 149 data collected from the targeted RT - PCRs and the microarray failed to show any heparin - induced changes in CDKN1C mRNA levels . It is possible that the observed differences in CDKN1C gene expression across analysis methods could be attributed to the experimental differences discussed in the results section . However , this is likely not the case , because the PCR arrays were performed on proliferative VSMCs as was the microarray , albeit at different heparin treatment times . If CDKN1C was truly regulated by heparin in proliferative cells , it would have come up by 24 hr of heparin treatment , because the anti - proliferative effects of heparin are sustained for much longer durations than 24 hr . Taken together , the gene expression analyses for CDKN1C suggest that the transcription of this gene is not regulated by heparin . The microarray data for DUSP1 and CDKN1B agree with the PCR array and targeted RT - PCR data and the microarray data for CDKN1C agree with the RT - PCR data . The CKDN1C PCR array data point was determined to be an outlier and not representative of heparin regulation . These findings strengthen the conclusion that heparin does not significantly regulate these three genes in VSMCs . A current model which is in line with the data suggests that heparin regulates transcript and protein stability to facilitate , at least in part , its anti - proliferative affects in VSMCs . This has been shown to be the case for CDKN1B ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) and is likely the case for DUSP1 and CDKN1C . Another possibility is that heparin could regulate transcript usage as well , which could also explain the results showing a lack of heparin - induced mRNA level changes . 150 The genes from the microarray analysis can be broken into four major categories of cell surface receptor signaling , peptidase activity , integrin complexes and signaling , and responses to fluid shear stress . Of particular interest to this dissertation are the responses to fluid shear stress and the regulation of cell surface receptor signaling . The response to laminar shear stress is interesting because it ties Chapter 3 into this chapter . Chapter 3 dealt with the atheroprotective nature of FSS in the vasculature , establishing a role for cofilin and actin realignment in endothelial barrier maintenance . The microarray identified that gene responses to laminar shear stress were also regulated by heparin , suggesting that the FSS experiments should be completed in the presence and absence of heparin to further determine their combined atheroprotective roles . This idea is being explored by Sara Lynn Nicole Farwell , who is interested in studying cellular responses to heparin and cytokines under physiologically relevant FSS conditions . This is an exciting area to explore , because the two fields have yet to be explored jointly and will undoubtedly yield promising data . As mentioned , another interesting finding from the microarray was that heparin regulates a large amount of cell surface receptor signaling . The role of heparin in cell surface receptor signaling has been established for many receptors and signaling cascades , but the microarray provided many novel pathways that have not been studied in the context of heparin . As a preamble to this discussion , it is unknown as to whether heparin would exert its affects on these pathways through binding to a receptor altering downstream signaling cascade or if it would be due to growth factor sequestration or receptor binding enhancement . Both models have been demonstrated for various 151 signaling systems and are extensively documented in the literature ( for review see Slee JB , Pugh R , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . The signaling molecule that is the highest interest to the work done in the lab is guanylate cyclase 1 , soluble , beta 3 gene ( GUCY1B3 ) which was up - regulated 1 . 714 fold by heparin treatment for 24 hr . GUCY1B3 is the beta subunit of soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC ) which catalyzes the conversion of GTP to the second messenger cyclic GMP ( cGMP ) , and functions as the main receptor for nitric oxide ( NO ) . It has been shown that heparin signaling in VSMCs depends on cGMP and PKG ( Gilotti AC diss 2000 and Chapter 7 ) . The finding that heparin up - regulates GUCY1B3 raises the possibility of a feed forward loop in which heparin increases cGMP to in turn increase PKG , thus strengthening the heparin responses in these cells . These data further support the conclusions drawn in Chapter 7 , showing that PKG is involved in heparin signaling . The role of cGMP and PKG in heparin signaling will be discussed further in Chapter 7 , however the finding that heparin increased GUCY1B3 is a biologically relevant finding of the microarray , raising the possibility of a feed forward signaling mechanism . Another interesting finding is that the regulator of G - protein signaling 4 ( RGS4 ) was increased 3 . 039 fold by heparin treatment for 24 hr in RAOSMCs . RGS4 is a member of a protein family which accelerates GTP hydrolysis by the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G - proteins , thereby inactivating the G - protein and rapidly switching off GPCR signaling pathways ( Gu S et al . 2009 ) . Although not heavily cited in the literature , RGS4 is most well known for its role in endothelial cells where it has been shown that RGS4 over - expression antagonizes vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) 152 stimulation of DNA synthesis , ERK1 / 2 activation , and p38 MAPK activation , suggesting that RGS4 inhibits cell proliferation , migration , and invasion in endothelial cells ( Albig AR and Schiemann WP 2005 ) . While , it was initially thought that RGS4 was not expressed in cultured smooth muscle cells ( Wieland T and Mittmann C 2003 ) ; it has since been shown to be expressed in VSMCs where it is involved in sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( S1P ) signaling ( Hendriks - Balk MC et al . 2008 ) . Although further work is necessary to validate the RGS4 microarray data , it is an exciting possibility for being involved in heparin signaling because RGS4 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation by antagonizing VEGF - stimulated cell proliferation and ERK activation in endothelial cells . If the same is true in VSMCs in response to heparin , this could provide another downstream target of heparin that leads to decreased cell proliferation by modulating DNA synthesis and ERK activity . Given that RGS4 is regulated by heparin , it is not surprising , that the S1P signaling pathway was a pathway with 12 genes which were regulated by heparin treatment for 24 hr . Another interesting gene that was regulated by heparin and has interesting physiological implications for atherosclerosis was oxidized low density lipoprotein ( lectin - like ) receptor 1 ( LOX - 1 ) , showing a fold change of 1 . 773 relative to untreated control . LOX - 1 is a receptor which belongs to the C - type lectin superfamily that serves as the receptor for oxidized low - density lipoproteins ( Mehta JL et al . 2006 and Li DY et al . 2002 ) . LOX - 1 has been extensively shown to be up - regulated in advanced atherosclerotic arteries and its inhibition has been associated with attenuation of the atherosclerotic process ( Mehta JL et al . 2006 and Li DY et al . 2002 ) . LOX - 1 is thought to serve as a 153 central hub in atherosclerosis serving as the initial player in promoting endothelial cell dysfunction and apoptosis ( Ulrich - Merzenich G and Zeitler H 2013 , Li DY et al . 2002 , and Mehta JL et al . 2006 ) . LOX - 1 expression has been shown to be regulated by a variety of factors such as cytokines and shear stress which are involved in atherosclerosis ( Mehta JL et al . 2006 ) , further suggesting the central role of LOX - 1 in the progression of atherosclerosis . Aside from its known roles in endothelial cells , LOX - 1 has also been shown to be involved in the proliferation , migration , and apoptosis of smooth muscle cells as well as other events critical to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis ( reviewed in : Xu S et al . 2012 ) . Because LOX - 1 has been linked to the development of atherosclerosis , it is interesting that heparin treatment would cause a moderate fold increase , given that LOX - 1 inhibition has been strongly linked to protection against atherosclerosis . Clearly at this point , the mechanism behind heparin - induced LOX - 1 expression is unknown , but this presents an exciting gene to explore given its role in atherosclerosis and recent excitement about finding drugs which could potentially inhibit LOX - 1 . Not surprisingly , the integrin family was the pathway with the largest number of regulated genes ( 16 genes total ) . Of these 16 genes , 3 of them were regulated at a level greater than 1 . 5 fold , including integrin alpha 4 ( 1 . 612 ) , integrin alpha 7 ( 1 . 699 ) , and integrin beta - like 1 ( 2 . 049 ) . As mentioned previously , two of the major hallmarks of atherosclerosis are vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration to the site of injury . Both of which are strongly inhibited by heparin treatment ( reviewed in : Slee JB , Pugh R , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . Therefore it is logical that heparin would up - regulate certain genes that are involved in cell migration , such as the integrin family . 154 Integrin alpha 4 has been shown to associate with paxillin ( Han J et al . 2001 ) which serves as a docking protein to recruit signaling molecules to focal adhesions ( Schaller MD 2001 ) . Paxillin also provides a link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton , to facilitate cell spreading and motility ( Schaller MD 2001 ) . It has also been shown that inhibition of integrin alpha 4 association with paxillin inhibits integrin alpha 4 - dependent cell proliferation ( Liu S et al . 2002 ) . Integrin beta - like 1 has also been associated with cell adhesion , proliferation , and migration ( Humphries JD , Byron A , and Humphries MJ 2006 ) . Lastly , integrin alpha 7 serves as the receptor for laminin in skeletal , heart , and smooth muscle cells and is involved in cell migration through the p130 ( CAS ) / Crk protein complex ( Mielenz D et al . 2001 ) . Assuming the increased mRNA of these integrin components would equate to increased protein expression , it is clear that they could be involved in mediating heparin’s affects on cell adhesion , proliferation , and migration . Eluding to the notion that heparin may regulate protein stability and / or degradation , a large number of peptidase inhibitors were upregulated by a 24 hr heparin treatment . The following peptidase inhibitors were upregulated : serine ( or cysteine ) peptidase inhibitor clade A ( 1 . 528 ) , serine ( or cysteine ) peptidase inhibitor clade B member 2 ( 1 . 603 ) , serine ( or cysteine ) peptidase inhibitor clade A member 3N ( 1 . 685 ) , serine ( or cysteine ) peptidase inhibitor clade B member 7 ( 1 . 702 ) , serine ( or cysteine ) peptidase inhibitor clade A ( 1 . 791 ) , and peptidase inhibitor 15 ( 2 . 163 ) . Serine ( or cysteine ) peptidase inhibitors are often referred to as Serpins ( Serine Protease Inhibitors ) for short . Common Serpins include antithrombin ( AT ) , heparin cofactor II ( HCII ) , anti - trypsin , and protein C inhibitor ( PCI ) ( Rein CM , Desai UR , and Church FC 2011 ) . The 155 entire Serpin family share poor sequence homology but share a highly conserved core structure that is essential for their function as protease inhibitors , allowing for significant overlapping mechanisms of inhibition ( Huntington JA 2011 ) . The activity of most Serpins relies on glycoasminoglycans ( GAGs ) , such as heparin or heparan sulfates , to reach physiological relevant rates of inhibition ( Rein CM , Desai UR , and Church FC 2011 and Huntington JA 2011 ) . The GAGs act as a bridge between the Serpin and the protease , allowing for faster complex formation , thereby strengthening the rate of inhibition ( Rein CM , Desai UR , and Church FC 2011 and Huntington JA 2011 ) . Perhaps the best characterized example of herpain interacting with a Serpin is AT . Heparin facilitates the interaction of AT with thrombin , inhibiting thrombin and subsequent thrombus formation ( Huntington JA 2011 ) . Therefore , it comes as no surprise that heparin treatment increased the mRNA level of various Serpins , due to their essential interaction with GAGs which is virtually required for inhibition of their target . Lastly , a number of transcription factors were upregulated in response to 24 hr of heparin treatment . Most notably , these include the activating protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) transcription factor network , specifically fos - related antigen - 1 and 2 ( Fra1 and Fra2 ) . AP - 1 is an early response heterodimeric transcription factor composed of proteins belonging to the c - Fos , c - Jun , activating transcription factor ( ATF ) , and jun dimerization protein ( JDP ) families ( Karin M , Liu Zg , and Zandi E 1997 ) . AP - 1 is involved in cell proliferation , transformation , apoptosis , and inflammation ( Shaulian E and Karin M . 2002 and Schonthaler HB , Guinea - Viniegra J , and Wagner EF 2011 ) , suggesting that heparin could alter AP - 1 - induced gene expression to facilitate long term changes in 156 vascular smooth muscle cell physiology . Although further work is needed to validate the role of AP - 1 in heparin signaling , it is an interesting avenue to explore in the future , because it could be the start of differentiation - related gene expression . The collection of gene expression analyses performed within this chapter suggest that not only is heparin capable of regulating transcript and protein stability , but also regulating gene expression of a moderate number of genes . Of all genes tested , only 100 or so genes were significantly regulated by heparin , suggesting that heparin’s affects are mediated by a small number of signaling molecules and pathways . The pathways represented overlap considerably with a single regulated gene being involved in multiple pathways , serving as cross - talk points between them . Another interesting conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that heparin seems to preferentially up - regulate gene expression rather than down - regulate it . Of the 100 or so genes that are significantly regulated by heparin , approximately 80 of them are up - regulated and only 20 of them are down - regulated , many of which are down - regulated at very small non - significant fold changes . Given the relatively small number of heparin - sensitive genes , there are a number of opportunities for future endeavors into further or understanding of non - traditional heparin signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells . 157 6 . 5 : Figures Figure 6 . 3 : MAPK PCR array data highlights Graph highlighting fold changes that were determined to be significant by SABiosciences analysis software .

Heparin is a potential molecule for the short - term treatment of atherosclerosis . It was initially shown that heparin suppresses VSMC growth more than 30 years ago ( Clowes AW and Karnovsky MJ 1977 ) ; yet the mechanism by which heparin inhibits VSMC proliferation remains unclear . Heparin has been documented to block PKC - dependent c - fos induction and ERK activation in response to a variety of treatments in sub - cultured VSMCs ( Castellot JJ et al . 1989 , Ottlinger ME , Pukac LA , and Karnovsky MJ 1993 ) . As discussed in detail in Chapters 1 and 6 , heparin treatment causes decreased CDK2 activity by stabilizing p27 kip1 ( Fasciano S et al . 2005 ) . Some of the anti - proliferative affects of heparin can be attributed to growth factor sequestration ; however , sequestration cannot explain all of the effects of heparin on VSMCs ( Reilly CF et al . 1989 , Pukac LA et al . 1997 , Savage JM et al . 2001 , Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . VSMCs specifically bind and endocytose heparin ( Castellot JJ et al . 1985 ) . This specific binding activity , in combination with heparin’s effects on cell signaling pathways , supports a model whereby heparin binds to cell surface proteins and initiates its own signaling pathways . This notion is supported by the fact that monoclonal antibodies which recognize a single heparin - binding cell surface protein specifically inhibit heparin binding to cells in vitro and act as agonists of heparin , mimicking both heparin’s effects on cell signaling and its anti - proliferative effects on cultured VSMCs ( Patton WA et al . 1995 , Savage JM et al . 2001 , and Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . 170 MAPK activity is regulated by the reversible phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and threonine residues , and active ERK accumulation in the nucleus is critical in cell cycle progression through G 1 ( Brunet A et al . 1999 ) where the sustained ERK activity results in Elk - 1 phosphorylation ( Shin HS et al . 2003 ) . DUSPs play important roles in ERK inactivation , and MKP - 1 localizes to the nucleus ( Rohan PJ et al . 1993 ) where it is able to regulate ERK signaling in VSMCs . Loss of active ERK in the nucleus results in decreased Elk - 1 activity ( Shin HS et al . 2003 ) . Data from our laboratory demonstrate that heparin and anti - heparin receptor antibodies increase MKP - 1 protein levels in VSMCs , mediating , at least in part heparin - induced ERK activity decreases ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . However , the signaling intermediates between heparin’s interaction with its receptor and induction of MKP - 1 expression remain unknown . One possibility is suggested by studies of insulin signaling ( Begum N et al . 1998 and Jacob A et al . 2002 ) . These studies report the expression of MKP - 1 in VSMCs in response to insulin and IGF ; where insulin and IGF induce the expression of iNOS , eventually increasing the levels of cGMP in response to the NO activation of sGC . The increase in cGMP levels was shown to be sufficient to induce MKP - 1 expression and attenuate ERK activity . Similarly , leptin treatment induces decreased VSMC proliferation , and this depends on iNOS induction ( Rodríguez A et al . 2010 ) . As well as in heparin treated cells , p27 kip1 is induced in response to cGMP rises and PKG activity in VSMCs ( Sato J et al . 2000 ) . Another agent that elevates cGMP in VSMCs is ANF or ANP . Upon ligand binding , the ANP receptor activates an intracellular guanylate cyclase thereby increasing cGMP levels . Both ANP and cGMP have been shown to decrease the proliferation of 171 VSMCs ( Baldini PM et al . 2002 and Tantini B et al . 2005 ) . Increased cGMP induces MKP - 1 expression in smooth muscle , mesangial and endothelial cells through PKG ( Sugimoto T et al . 1996 , Baldini PM et al . 2002 , Jacob A et al . 2002 , and Furst R et al . 2005 ) . The increased MKP - 1 expression decreases ERK activation , and provides a mechanism for the anti - proliferative activity of ANP in VSMC ( Sugimoto T et al . 1996 , Baldini PM et al . 2002 , and Tantini B et al . 2005 ) . ANP treatment , like heparin treatment , induces increases in p27 kip1 levels ( Hannken T et al . 2001 ) . Heparin and cGMP affect VSMCs similarly . First , both inhibit growth of VSMCs late in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle . Second , the proximity of the endothelium to VSMCs in vivo provides a source for both endogenous heparin and cGMP - elevating agents such as NO . Endogenous heparin from endothelial cells could maintain quiescence in VSMCs ( Castellot JJ et al . 1981 ) . Third , in reducing VSMC growth , both cGMP and heparin cause an inactivation of ERK due , at least in part , to the induction of MKP - 1 ( Baldini PM et al . 2002 and Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) . Because of the similarities in the way that heparin , ANP , and NO - induced cGMP increases affect VSMCs , the lab hypothesized that heparin’s cellular effects are mediated through the second messenger cGMP target , PKG . Consistent with this idea is evidence that reductions in cGMP signaling occur with neointimal proliferation and vascular dysfunction in late - stage atherosclerosis ( Melichar VO et al . 2004 ) . Also consistent with this hypothesis is the fact that expression of constitutively active PKG inhibits VSMC proliferation in response to high glucose ( Wang S and Li Y 2009 ) . 172 Previously collected data from the lab suggest that cGMP mimics heparin and PKG inhibition blocks heparin - induced decreases in VSMC DNA synthesis shown by BrdU incorporation ( Gilotti AC diss 2000 ) . The heparin - induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was shown to be dependent on PKG and the role of PKA was ruled out using inhibitors of PKA ( Gilotti AC diss 2000 ) . Heparin signaling normally results in decreased ERK activity , but when PKG is inhibited using chemical inhibitors , this affect is significantly decreased ( Gilotti AC diss 2000 and Miller EA unpublished data ) . It was also established that heparin decreases Elk - 1 activity along with decreasing ERK activity , and that inhibiting PKG disrupts these decreases ( Nimlamool WN unpublished data ) . Concurrent with the requirement for PKG in mediating heparin signaling , heparin treatment in VSMCs results in increases in cGMP concentration ( Gilotti AC diss 2000 ) . As discussed previously , some of the anti - proliferative action of heparin is mediated through MKP - 1 , which was shown to be dependent upon cGMP and MKP - 1 activity ( Gilotti AC diss 2000 ) . The missing piece of experimental evidence from this work was definitive evidence showing that reducing PKG levels resulted in altered heparin signaling . To accomplish this , I set out to utilize targeted PKG siRNA and functionally link decreased PKG to decreased heparin sensitivity in A7r5 VSMCs . Taken together with my contribution to the project , we have shown PKG activity is required for heparin - induced decreases in VSMC ERK activity , Elk - 1 phosphorylation , and VSMC proliferation . The culmination of this work has been submitted to J . Cell Phsyiol and is pending their initial review . 173 7 . 2 : Methods 7 . 2 . 1 : Cell Culture A7r5s were cultured as described in Chapter 2 . 7 . 2 . 2 : PKG siRNA Transfection PKG siRNA transfection was carried out as described Chapter 5 for TMEM184A siRNA . 7 . 2 . 3 : Heparin Assay in PKG siRNA Transfected Cells The heparin assay was performed as done in Chapter 5 . 7 . 2 . 4 : Immunofluorescence Staining Primary antibodies against pERK , PKGα and β ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and pElk - 1 ( Cell Signaling , Boston , MA ) were used as described in Chapter 2 . 7 . 2 . 5 : Fluorescence Microscopy Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine whole cell expression levels of PKG , relative knockdown of PKG in siRNA / shRNA - treated cells , and the PDGF / Heparin - induced responses in pERK and pElk - 1 levels . Performed as described in Chapter 2 . 7 . 2 . 6 : SDS - PAGE and Western Blotting Performed as described in Chapter 2 . 7 . 3 : Results Because the timing of PKG inhibitors in these assays was very specific , we confirmed the importance of PKG activity in heparin effects on ERK phosphorylation in cells where PKG levels were significantly decreased through the use of siRNA . Recall 174 from Chapter 5 that control experiments were carried out with FITC - control siRNA in A7r5s showing that the majority of cells took up the siRNA ( Figure 4 . 10 ) . PKG knockdown efficiency varied between experiments from occasionally greater than 90 % knockdown to about 50 % decrease in staining in A7r5 cells treated with siRNA compared to scrambled control . Cells allowed to recover in starvation media exhibited insignificant knockdown of PKG ( data not shown ) . Therefore , cells were treated with control siRNA or PKG siRNA and were cultured in regular growth media for 72 hr and then treated with heparin for 20 min followed by PDGF for 15 min . Controls with PDGF or no treatment were compared . The presence of PKG , pERK and pElk - 1 was determined by immunofluorescent staining ( Figure 7 . 1A and 7 . 1B ) . Despite incomplete knockdown , it is clear that heparin - induced decreases in pERK and pElk - 1 staining were very limited in PKG siRNA treated cells compared to cells with scrambled siRNA . Western Blots confirm that heparin treatment does not have much effect on ERK activation in cells where PKG levels have been significantly decreased ( Figure 7 . 1C ) . 7 . 4 : Discussion The proliferation of VSMCs in healthy vessels is carefully regulated , and heparin has been shown to block a number of important signaling events in VSMCs ( i . e . Ottlinger ME et al . 1993 and Pukac LA et al . 1997 ) . Data showing that antibodies to a heparin receptor mimic the effects of heparin strongly suggesting that heparin is acting through a receptor protein to mediate a portion of its effects ( Savage JM et al . 2001 ) . Heparin binding to its receptor protein would presumably trigger an intracellular signal 175 transduction cascade likely involved in heparin - induced decreases in PDGF - stimulated BrdU incorporation and deactivation of ERK MAPK activity ( Savage JM et al . 2001 ) , expression of MKP - 1 ( Blaukovitch CI et al . 2010 ) , and decreased Elk - 1 phosphorylation in VSMCs . In fact , the changes in Elk - 1 phosphorylation are consistent with reports that Elk - 1 phosphorylation results in changes in gene expression . Obvious mechanisms for heparin - induced PKG - mediated modulation of VSMC proliferation involve phosphorylation of transcription factors ( reviewed in Pilz RB and Broderick KE 2005 ) and reported for Elk - 1 ( Choi CS et al . 2010 ) . Previous results from the lab coupled to my experimental data provide evidence for the involvement of PKG in downstream events of heparin receptor activation . Heparin has previously been demonstrated to have an anti - proliferative effect on VSMCs in rats and in an endothelial / VSMC co - culture system , but while NO production in the heparin - treated rats played a role in the response ; it did not appear to be involved in heparin - induced decreases in VSMC proliferation ( Horstman D et al . 2002 ) . NO is a cell permeable activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase . Treatment of cells with synthetic NO donors or activators of NO synthase causes a rapid increase in intracellular concentrations of cGMP , while particulate guanylyl cyclases often result in limited cGMP increases ( Su J et al . 2005 ) . In addition , production of cGMP at the membrane does not produce cGMP increases throughout the cell ( Nausch LW et al . 2008 ) , consistent with the idea that robust increases in cGMP may not be necessary for phsyiological reponses . Rather , limited localized signaling might lead to physiological results without significant increases in total cGMP levels due to location specific smaller 176 increases in cGMP . ANP treatment of VSMCs does limit their proliferation ( Baldini PM et al . 2002 ) , and the limited increase in cGMP induced by heparin seems to be an important mechanism by which heparin interaction with the receptor induces changes in VSMC signaling and proliferation . One possible mechanism whereby heparin could affect VSMCs while inducing modest elevations of cGMP levels is through localization in caveolae . As mentioned previously , caveolae serve as signaling hubs in most cells , especially cells of the vasculature . The expression of caveolin has been reported to be affected by heparin and caveolin expression has been linked to VSMC growth ( Peterson TE et al . 1999 ) . Heparin receptor localization to caveolae could also explain other heparin effects which have been shown to be associated with caveolae function ( Liu YT , Song L , and Templeton DM 2007 ) . If the heparin receptor is localized in caveolae , binding could result in localized signaling through PKG by activating a NOS protein in VSMC ( Cheah LS et al . 2002 ) or caveolae might modulate PKG activity adjacent to the caveolae . Characterization of TMEM184A as a receptor for heparin supports the notion that the receptor co - localizes with caveolin - 1 at membrane patches ( Figure 4 . 4 ) . Signaling through cGMP and PKG is further supported by the fact that TMEM184A also co - localizes with eNOS in vascular cells ( Figure 4 . 5 ) . The functional data presented in Chapter 4 , strongly suggest that TMEM184A is a receptor for heparin , demonstrating that at least a subset of the heparin receptor localizes to cav - 1 - containing caveolae to mediate the proposed signaling events outlined above . 177 Whatever the mechanism and down - stream signaling from PKG , our data suggest that heparin treatment causes the elevation of cGMP levels and indicate a role for PKG in heparin - induced decreased VSMC proliferation . My contribution to this project specifically demonstrated that PKG knockdown caused reduced heparin sensitivity in VSMCs as assayed by PDGF - induced changes in pERK and pElk - 1 . When PKG is significantly decreased by siRNA , cells not longer exhibit heparin - induced decreases in PDGF stimulated pERK and pElk - 1 . The culmination of this work suggests a mechanism whereby heparin binds to this cell surface protein activating a guanylyl cyclase causing a rapid elevation of cGMP , in turn , activating PKG . This idea is supported by 1 ) the rapid elevation of intracellular cGMP in heparin - treated cells , 2 ) the sensitivity of the heparin effects to PKG inhibitors , and 3 ) the sensitivity to partial knock down of PKG protein . 178 7 . 5 : Figure 179 Figure 7 . 1 : Knockdown of PKG decreases heparin effects on ERK activity and pElk A7r5 cells were electroporated with siRNA designed to knock down PKG in rat cells or scrambled RNA , and the cells were allowed to proliferate in growth media for 72 h with feeding at 24 h . At 72 h , cells were untreated , treated with PDGF for 15 min or heparin for 20 min before PDGF was added for 15 min . Panel ( A ) illustrates the pElk levels ( pictures A - F ) . Staining for PKG is illustrated in the same cells in pictures G - L . Scrambled siRNA ( A , B , C , G , H , I ) as compared to PKG siRNA ( D , E , F , J , K , L ) is shown for cells not stimulated ( A , D , G , J ) , PDGF treated cells ( B , E , H , K ) and heparin plus PDGF ( C , F , I , L ) . Panel ( B ) illustrates an experiment where pERK was monitored ( A’ - F’ ) PKG staining for these cell samples is shown in pictures G’ - L’ . The treatment pattern is identical to that for panel A . These experiments are representative of two similar experiments each . Panel ( C ) illustrates Western Blots of A7r5 cells treated to knock down PKG for 72 h as above and analyzed by blotting for pERK and PKG levels . Lanes 1 - 3 illustrate cells treated with scrambled siRNA and 4 - 6 represent cells treated with PKG siRNA . Lanes 1 and 4 illustrate cells harvested without further treatment , lanes 2 and 5 cells treated with PDGF for 15 min and lanes 3 and 6 are cells treated with heparin and PDGF as above . Blots were developed using ECL reagents . Images are representative of a least three experiments . Scale bars = 30 µm . 180 Chapter 8 : Conclusions and future directions 181 It is clear that cardiovascular diseases , including atherosclerosis and its complications , are the leading causes of death in many societies . The alarming increase in cardiovascular disease - related deaths correlates with the increasing percentage of the population classified as obese . Although cardiovascular disease and obesity are largely preventable through lifestyle modification , no decrease in their occurrence is foreseeable in the near future . Therefore , great interest in science and medicine has been focused on understanding the development of atherosclerosis and on potential mechanisms to slow or reverse the atherosclerotic process . Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease which occurs in response to injury to the arterial wall , resulting in endothelial cell dysfunction , VSMC proliferation , and migration to the site of injury ( Ross R 1999 and Rudijanto A 2007 ) . This injury leads to endothelial cell dysfunction causing excessive , chronic inflammation and phenotypic changes in the endothelial cell layer . The endothelium loses its anticoagulant nature becoming pro - coagulant . This pro - coagulant nature causes the release of inflammatory cytokines , platelet activation , and the release of PDGF triggering the surrounding VSMCs to become proliferative ( Ross R 1993 and Ross R 1999 ) . Although not completely understood at this time , the inflammatory response is largely mediated by IL - 1β and TNFα ( Kishikawa H , Shimokama T , and Watanabe T 1993 , Rus HG , Niculescu F , and Vlaicu R 1991 , Moyer CF et al . 1991 , and Galea J et al . 1996 ) , and the immune response is predominantly mediated by the upregulation of adhesion molecules ( i . e . ICAM and VCAM ) ( Viemann D et al . 2006 ) . This recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes causes the release of additional inflammatory molecules including 182 hydrolytic enzymes , cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors leading to more wall damage and the development of a fibrous plaque ( Ross R 1993 and Ross R 1999 ) . Two major hallmarks of atherosclerosis include endothelial cell dysfunction and smooth muscle cell proliferation induced through the uncontrolled inflammatory response . Therefore the goal of this dissertation was to further our understanding of the development of atherosclerosis and potential ways to attenuate this excessive inflammation . These goals included the anti - inflammatory nature of shear stress in the vasculature and the potential use of heparin as a short - term anti - inflammatory treatment or the possibility of activating the heparin signaling pathway without heparin for the long - term treatment of vascular disease . To accomplish these goals , the role of shear stress in maintaining barrier integrity in vascular endothelium was determined to involve cofilin , a cell surface protein was identified as a receptor for heparin , and the signaling pathway from that receptor to MKP - 1 was elucidated . Along with identifying this signaling pathway , heparin - induced gene expression changes were investigated in vascular smooth muscle cells . Lastly , it was shown that heparin exerts its anti - inflammatory effect by attenuating TNFα responses in vascular endothelial cells . It has been well established that shear stress plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and promoting the anti - coagulant and anti - inflammatory ( atheroprotective ) environment found in healthy vasculature ( and reviewed in : Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 and Hahn C and Schwartz MA ) . Regions of the vasculature that are exposed to laminar shear stress are considered atheroprotective whereas regions exposed to disrupted shear stress are pro - coagulant and pro - 183 inflammatory ( atheroprone ) . However the exact mechanism underlying how this mechanical stress affects vascular physiology remains unclear . Previous work performed in the lab documented that atheroprotective levels of shear stress induce whole cell , nuclei , and actin microfilament realignment in the direction of shear stress , suggesting that this alignment was in some way beneficial ( Mengistu M et al . 2011 and reviewed in : Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . This alignment in the direction of shear stress is also found in vivo further supporting the hypothesis that this alignment is in some way atheroprotective ( reviewed in : Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . Hamel M et al . ( 2006 ) also determined that stress kinase ( JNK and p38 ) activity was required for this shear stress - induced actin realignment , further supporting the observation that active JNK and p38 associate with the actin cytoskeleton . To further understand the role of shear stress as an anti - inflammatory mediator , I investigated the role that cofilin played in the process of shear stress - induced actin realignment . Cofilin , a prominent actin depolymerizing protein , is involved in regulating actin dynamics by binding actin filaments and facilitating their breakdown . Shear stress was shown to induce p - cofilin localization to the nucleus without significantly altering total cofilin levels in a confluent monolayer of vascular endothelial cells ( Slee JB and Lowe - Krentz 2013 ) . The change in cofilin activity and localization were also dependent , in part , upon stress kinases JNK and p38 , although they were not directly involved in cofilin phosphorylation ( Slee JB and Lowe - Krentz 2013 ) . It has been shown that shear stress induces endothelial barrier tightening , creating an effective barrier in the vascular system ( DePaola N et al . 2001 and Seebach J et al . 2000 ) . I have shown that cofilin 184 activity is required for this shear stress - induced barrier tightening through its regulation of actin realignment ( Slee JB and Lowe - Krentz 2013 ) . Endothelial cells with improperly regulated cofilin fail to exhibit traditional actin realignment ultimately leading to gaps and breaks in cell - cell junctions ( Slee JB and Lowe - Krentz 2013 ) . These findings demonstrate that cofilin - mediated actin realignment is necessary for maintaining endothelial barrier integrity during shear stress , which furthers our understanding of how shear stress is atheroprotective . Cofilin in combination with JNK and p38 are activated in response to atheroprotective shear stress to facilitate actin realignment in the direction of shear stress which facilitates cell - cell junction tightening and increased barrier integrity . This is one way in which healthy endothelial cell physiology is promoted in order to prevent “leaky” endothelium which is associated with the development of atherosclerosis by the recruitment of immune cells and the release of inflammatory mediators . Given that this atheroprotective shear stress is not found in all regions of the vascular system , it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in mediating the downstream effects . The results from this work suggest that actin realignment is mis - regulated in atheroprone shear stress regions . An interesting future aspect to the shear stress work is in the field of implantable devices and stents . In the case of vascular stents , two major problems arise after implantation . Short - term failure can be caused by the inability of endothelial cells to grow on the stent and form the necessary anti - inflammatory layer . Long - term failure is often attributed to failure to endothelialize the stent and calcification of the stent leading to increased inflammatory signaling resulting in plaque formation in the stent ( reviewed 185 in : Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . The findings from my work mimics the implantation of stents . In this system , static cells are exposed to a surge of shear stress , similar to the surge of blood when a stent is implanted . Also understanding how shear stress relates to the atheroprotective nature of the vasculature by promoting a strong endothelial barrier , sheds light onto mechanisms of how to create this atheroprotective physiology in stents . Increasing our knowledge of how cells respond to this initial shear stress could potentially increase vascular stent success . To further explore ways to prevent calcification of vascular stents and promote the development of an atheroprotective stent environment I will be exploring the molecule CD47 in my post - doctoral position at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia . Initial studies show that CD47 greatly reduces calcification and increases long - term success of implantation ( Finley MJ et al . 2012 ) . A second way to potentially combat inflammation in the vascular system is to utilize the molecule heparin . Heparin has been repeatedly shown to possess anti - proliferative and anti - inflammatory qualities that make it an excellent possibility for treatment of vascular disease . However future work aimed at reducing the somewhat severe side effects before it could be used medicinally as a long - term therapy . The anti - proliferative effects of heparin have been linked to the regulation of MAPK cascade intermediates and to regulation of the cell cycle . Both serve to slow cell proliferation , which would be beneficial in atherosclerosis where one of the hallmarks is unwanted VSMC proliferation . The anti - inflammatory nature of heparin is starting to gain traction in the literature and includes the inhibition of complement activation , adhesion 186 molecules , and NFκB signaling ( reviewed in : Mengistu M , Slee JB , and Lowe - Krentz LJ 2012 ) . In my opinion , one of the best ways to further our understanding of heparin is to identify a protein which serves as a receptor . Evidence from our lab suggests that heparin exerts a portion of its effects through a receptor . Identification of a receptor for heparin opens up many options for harnessing the anti - proliferative and anti - inflammatory qualities of heparin without the side effects associated with long - term heparin treatment . Knowing the receptor would allow for the design of receptor agonists which could , in theory , mimic the effects of heparin in the vasculature . The data presented herein , combined with previously collected work by Raymond Pugh , strongly suggest that TMEM184A functions as a receptor for heparin . Data supporting this conclusion include mass spectrometry sequence analysis , immunoprecipitation , and siRNA knockdown coupled to functional assays . Along with the data demonstrating a role for TMEM184A as a receptor for heparin , descriptive experiments were performed to further our understanding of TMEM184A . TMEM184A was found to localize to peri - nuclear and membrane regions , where it co - localizes with VAMP , cav - 1 , and eNOS . A GFP - tagged version of TMEM184A was also used to demonstrate that it co - localizes with Rhodamine - tagged heparin in vascular smooth muscle cells . All of which indirectly support TMEM184A as a receptor for heparin . The functional data showing that TMEM184A knock down decreases heparin’s effects on established targets indicates that TMEM184A could be a receptor for heparin . Although some of the effects of heparin are due to sequestration of growth factor and other signaling molecules , identification of a receptor for heparin provides crucial 187 information for furthering our understanding of the mechanisms for heparin . We have published evidence and data presented in this dissertation that indicate signaling from a receptor is mediated through cGMP and PKG . Initially , work done by Albert Gilotti suggested that the cGMP / PKG pathway was involved in heparin signaling ( Gilotti A diss 2000 ) , which was strengthened by various members of the lab . My contribution to the project showed that specific knock down of PKG reduced heparin’s effects on published pathways . Although not definitively investigated in this dissertation , the possible involvement of eNOS in this pathway exists . Not only does eNOS typically play a role in increasing cGMP it was also determined that internalized TMEM184A co - localizes with eNOS in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells . The involvement of eNOS in mediating heparin signaling is currently being investigated by members of the lab . Preliminary results suggest that eNOS may be involved in heparin signaling ( Swanson K and Li Y unpublished data ) , although considerable more work is needed to confirm these data . In separate but related experiments , it was determined that heparin attenuates TNFα - induced inflammation in vascular endothelial cells . Initial work bone by Marianne Hamel and Daniela Kanyi showed that heparin treatment decreased TNFα - induced JNK and p38 activity and decreased their target activation ( Hamel M diss 2001 and Kanyi D diss 2006 ) . It was determined that these effects were also seen when anti - heparin receptor antibodies were used in place of heparin , indicating that heparin is acting through a receptor . To complete this story , I have shown that TNFα strongly induces actin stress fibers in sub - confluent endothelial cells and that this response is significantly attenuated 188 by heparin pretreatment . These data suggest that heparin possess anti - inflammatory qualities capable of reversing TNFα inflammation , which is mediated through receptor binding . To further our understanding of the mechanisms behind heparin , heparin - induced mRNA changes were investigated . The culmination of these studies suggests that heparin regulates a large number of genes that are related to cell proliferation , migration , inflammatory signaling , and GAG - dependent Serpins . Some of the genes that were shown to be significantly altered by heparin treatment were in pathways that I would expect to be regulated by heparin . GUCY1B3 is the gene of highest priority for immediate investigation , because it further supports involvement of cGMP and PKG in heparin signaling . This presents a possible feed forward loop in which the signal initiated by heparin binding to its receptor could be amplified by increasing GUCY1B3 and cell sensitivity to heparin . Another gene upregulated by heparin treatment suitable for immediate investigation includes RGS4 , which has been shown to antagonize VEGF stimulation of DNA synthesis , ERK1 / 2 activation , and p38 MAPK activation . Essentially , RGS4 performs much of the same functions of heparin in vascular cells . A final interesting point worth noting is that heparin preferentially upregulates more genes than it down - regulates . In fact , hardly any down - regulated genes reach a fold change of 1 . 5 , suggesting that heparin does not have many inhibitory roles on gene expression . The common thread among all of the data in this dissertation is inflammation and proliferation associated with atheroslcerosis and ways to prevent them . Shear stress is an important player in maintaining the anti - inflammatory and anti - coagulant atmosphere 189 necessary for healthy vasculature . Heparin is in a unique position to as an anti - inflammatory and anti - proliferative molecule in the vascular system . To mediate at least a portion of these effects , it seems that heparin binds to TMEM184A ( heparin receptor ) to facilitate an intracellular signaling cascade . One of those cascades involves signaling through cGMP , PKG , and presumably eNOS in VSMCs . A second of those cascades culminates in JNK and p38 activity to reduce inflammatory signaling in vascular endothelial cells , although the upstream signaling molecules are unknown at this point . Although it cannot be associated with receptor binding , heparin regulates a large number of genes in VSMCs related to proliferation , migration , inflammation , and transcription , suggesting that the study of heparin is only in its infancy . 190 Chapter 9 : References 191 Albig AR and Schiemann WP .

Briefly , cells were harvested in 600 μl of buffer RLT to which 600 μl of 70 % ethanol was added . 700 μl of this solution was then added to an RNeasy spin column and centrifuged for 15 sec at ≥ 10 , 000 rpm . The flow through was discarded and the column was rinsed with 350 μl of buffer RW1 and centrifuged for 15 sec at ≥ 10 , 000 rpm . Following the centrifugation , the on - column DNase digestion was performed by adding 10 μl of DNase I stock to 70 μl of buffer RDD and adding this entire solution to the membrane of the RNeasy spin column for 15 mins at room temperature . Following DNase digestion , 350 μl of buffer RW1 was added to the column and centrifuged for 15 sec at ≥ 10 , 000 rpm . The flow - through was discarded and 500 μl of buffer RPE was added to the column and centrifuged for 15 sec at ≥ 10 , 000 rpm . The flow - through was again discarded and 500 μl of buffer RPE was added to the column and centrifuged for 2 min at ≥ 10 , 000 rpm to dry the membrane . The RNeasy spin column was then placed in a new 2 ml collection tube and centrifuged for 1 min at ≥ 10 , 000 rpm to eliminate any remaining buffer RPE . The RNeasy spin column was then placed in a 1 . 5 ml microcentrifuge tube with the cap cut off . To elute RNA , 50 μl of provided RNase - free water was added direction to the RNeasy spin column membrane for at least 1 min and centrifuged for 1 min at ≥ 10 , 000 rpm . 228 RNA Quality Control To ensure that high quality total RNA was isolated , a nanodrop measurement was obtained for all RNA samples and an agarose gel was run . For RNA to pass the nanodrop measurement , the sample needed to have an A 260 / 280nm ratio of ~ 2 . 0 ± 1 . 5 and a concentration of ≥ 100 ng / ml . All samples also needed to show intact and robust ribosomal RNA bands on a 1 % agarose gel run in 1 % TAE buffer . Briefly , samples RNA samples were mixed with loading dye ( 50 : 50 ) and loaded onto the 1 % agarose gel . Gels were run for ~ 30 mins at 70 volts , stained using ethidium bromide , and imaged using a photodyne imager with ethidium bromide filter . High quality RNA samples were kept at - 20 ºC until used for the reverse transcription reaction . For the microarray analysis , additional quality control measures were performed by the company . Reverse Transcription Protocol Reverse transcription was carried out using Invitrogen’s SuperScript III First - Strand Synthesis Super Mix reagents .
