Extracellular vesicles may origin from the endosomal com - partment and share several characteristics with the envelope of lentiviruses . A previous study reported that constitutive expression of the tetraspanin CD9 , an extracellular vesicle marker , not only increases vesicle secretion from cells , but has also a positive effect on lenti - viral transduction efficiency . Moreover , it was shown that expression of CD9 on the viral envelope in absence of viral glycoproteins was sufficient for the transduction of mammalian cells . In this study , we investigate the effect of CD9 and folate receptor alpha , a GPI - anchored protein , on biosynthesis and transduction efficiency of vesicles carrying lentiviral vectors . We demonstrate that neither CD9 nor FR α nor the combination of both were able to mediate a significant transduction of therapeutic vesicles carrying lentiviral RNA . Further studies are required to identify endogenous mammalian proteins that can be used for pseu - dotyping of viral envelopes to improve viral targeting without inducing immune responses . Introduction Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are defined as “particles naturally released from the cell that are delimited by a lipid bilayer and cannot replicate” [ 1 ] . They can be of endosomal origin ( tradi - tionally called “exosomes” [ 2 ] ) or plasma - membrane derived ( “ectosomes” ) [ 3 ] . Selectively iso - lating one of these subpopulations is particularly challenging , as they share similar physical characteristics and protein markers [ 4 ] but may be achieved by the combination of advanced purification procedures . Exosomes share several characteristics with lentiviral particles : they both have a lipid bilayer membrane , they are similar in size and density [ 5 , 6 ] and they carry nucleic acids such as RNA [ 7 ] . In addition , one of the main pathways of exosome biogenesis is driven by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT - dependent pathway ) [ 8 , 9 ] and some ESCRT - associated proteins , like Alix and tumor susceptibility gene 101 pro - tein ( TSG101 ) , are considered exosomal markers [ 10 – 12 ] . ESCRT , Alix and TSG101 are all involved in virus budding [ 13 – 15 ] . Such similarity in the formation process of exosomes and lentivirus ( LV ) prompted some scientists to propose the Trojan exosome hypothesis , which PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0264642 March 10 , 2022 1 / 19 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Bellotti C , Sta¨uble A , SteinfeldR ( 2022 ) CD9 and folate receptor overexpression are not sufficient for VSV - G - independentlentiviral transduction .

Competinginterests : The authorshave declared that no competinginterestsexist . states that LVs hijacked the pre - existing cellular pathway of exosome biogenesis for infectious particles production [ 16 ] . In general , EVs produced by virus - infected cells can contain viral proteins [ 17 , 18 ] and RNA [ 19 , 20 ] and play a role in infection [ 21 ] . HIV - based LVs are one of the most used vectors for gene - therapy studies , and one of their advantages is the possibility to manipulate their tropism by changing the glycoproteins expressed on their envelope ( a process called pseudotyping ) [ 22 ] . Vesicular stomatitis virus GP ( VSV - G ) has become the standard for pseudotyping because it allows concentration of vectors to a high titre and it enables infection of a vast range of cell types [ 23 ] . However , using VSV - G has its disadvantages : if used in human subjects , it can elicit adaptive immune responses that cause vector inactivation [ 24 ] . This could result in major immune reactions if the therapy requires multiple application of the vector . Solutions to this problem are a focus of research : for example , it was proposed that the use of heterologous G - proteins from different viruses of the vesiculovirus genus in subsequent vector injections might circumvent the adaptive immune response [ 25 ] . Recently , EVs and in particular exosomes have become subjects of research for their poten - tial clinical applications as diagnostic markers and as vectors in targeted drug delivery [ 26 , 27 ] . The advantages of using EVs as drug carriers are their broad immune tolerance , low toxicity , good tissue penetrance and easy engineerability . In particular , since EVs are purified from mammalian cells they express only endogenous proteins that may not induce any immune response . Addressing the relationship between exosomal and lentiviral biogenesis , a study in 2018 investigated the effect of constitutive expression of exosomal markers on EVs secretion and LV production and infectivity [ 28 ] . One of the tested proteins was CD9 , belonging to the tetra - spanins , which are proteins commonly expressed on EVs [ 29 ] . This study demonstrated that overexpression of CD9 caused an increase in EVs production and an improvement of LV effi - ciency in gene delivery . The most notable result , though , was that CD9 expression allowed to achieve LV transduction in the absence of pseudotyping with the viral glycoprotein VSV - G . The possibility to engineer transduction - efficient LV vectors without viral envelope pro - teins would represent a major advantage , even if the infection rate was lower than in the pres - ence of VSV - G . The fact that CD9 is an endogenous human protein means that it would completely avoid the development of adaptive immunity . Based on these premises , we asked ourselves whether it was possible to use CD9 in conjuga - tion with other EVs markers to further functionalize the LV vectors and increase specific tar - geting to certain tissues and cells . Folate receptor alpha ( FR α ) is a protein expressed by epithelial cells derived from kidney , lung and breast [ 30 ] . Most importantly , FR α is expressed in choroid plexus cells and was identified as the main folate transporter to the central nervous system ( CNS ) [ 31 , 32 ] . It is anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor [ 33 ] and it is transported to GPI - enriched early endosomal compartments [ 34 ] . Although FR α is not classically considered an EVs marker , it was found to be expressed on the surface of exosomes secreted by the choroid plexus cells into the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) [ 32 ] . In addition , we demonstrated that histidine - tagged FR α can be used as a marker to selec - tively purify EVs of endosomal origin with a chromatographic approach [ 35 ] . Since FR α - posi - tive vesicles in the cerebrospinal fluid are able to cross the ependymal cell layer and deliver folate to the brain parenchyma , it was hypothesized that FR α could be used to increase delivery of therapeutics to the brain [ 32 ] . In this study , we examined the influence of constitutive expression of FR α in conjugation with CD9 on EVs production and LVs infectivity . Our goal was to obtain CNS - targeted transduction - efficient vectors for clinical application in cases of neurodegenerative diseases .

All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) + GlutaMAX ( Gibco ) with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) and appropriate antibiotics . For experiments involving EVs isolation , cell lines were adapted to Serum Free Medium 293 ( SFM II ) ( Gibco ) . First , a ratio of 1 : 1 DMEM to SFM supplemented with GlutaMAX ( Gibco ) was used . Then SFM percentage was gradually increased until cells could survive in 100 % SFM . Plasmids pCMV - VSV - G and pLenti6 . 3 - CD9 GFP were a gift from J . Gruber , German Primate Center Go¨ttingen , Germany . pCMV - dR8 . 91 and SEW _ SFFVU3 _ GFP were a gift from J . Reichen - bach , University of Zurich , Switzerland . The CD9 sequence was amplified from cDNA of HEK 293 cells ( primer sequences are listed in S1 Table ) . NheI and XhoI restriction sites were attached at the N - and C - terminus in a sec - ond PCR step so that the sequence could be inserted in a modified version of the pBlueScript II plasmid . The CD9 sequence was cut out and inserted into pCDNA - IRES - T3 , while a copy of N - terminally polyhistidine - tagged FR α was inserted into pEF - T1 . Both plasmids were then cut with NotI and PvuI and ligated together to obtain a single plasmid carrying the sequence of both target genes ( pEFTT - HisFR α - CD9 ) . To produce pLenti6 . 3 - CD9 the GFP - CD9 insert was cut out from pLenti6 . 3 - CD9 GFP and replaced with the CD9 sequence . For pLenti6 . 3 - EGFP , the EGFP sequence was cut out from SEW _ SFFVU3 _ GFP and inserted into the pLenti backbone . All PCR steps were performed using the Phusion High - Fidelity PCR Kit ( New England Bio - Labs ) and were carried out in a TProfessional Thermocycler ( Biometra Ltd ) . Oligonucleotide production and sequencing were done by Microsynth AG . Generation of stable cell lines Human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells were purchased from ATCC . HEK 293T were a gift from J . Reichenbach , University of Zurich , Switzerland . The FR α overexpressing cell line was generated as previously described [ 35 ] . To generate the FR α / CD9 overexpressing line 300 , 000 HEK 293 cells per well were plated in a 6 - well plate and cultured for about 7 hours . Calcium - phosphate precipitation was then used to transfect the cells with 1 μ g pEFTT - HisFR α - CD9 . Selection was performed adding 1 μ g / ml Puromycin ( Gibco ) and 50 μ g / ml Geneticin ( Gibco ) to the media . To generate the CD9 and GFP - CD9 cell lines , LVs carrying pLenti6 . 3 - CD9 or pLen - ti6 . 3 - CD9 GFP were produced in HEK 293T . 50 , 000 HEK 293T were then transduced with a 1 : 10 dilution of one of these LVs . After 70 h incubation , the virus was removed and cells were selected with 10 μ g / ml Blasticidin ( Gibco ) . Protein extraction and quantification Cell pellets were collected , washed in PBS , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % Sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS ) containing proteinase inhibitors , incubated on ice for 15 minutes and centrifuged for 15 min , 14500 rpm at 4˚C . The resulting supernatant was collected and protein concentration was estimated with a Pierce BCA assay using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) .

Transfer to a 0 . 2 μ m PVDF membrane was performed in a Tran - Blot Turbo Transfer System ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) using a Trans - Blot Turbo RTA Mini Transfer Kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Membranes were incubated in blocking solution for at least 30 min room temperature ( RT ) and then in the primary antibody solution overnight at 4˚C . The following day the membranes were washed 4 times in TBST and incubated in the secondary antibody solution for 2 hours at RT . Afterwards , washings in TBST were repeated . A 1 : 1 mix of the Clarity ECL Western Blotting Substrates ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) was applied to the membranes and signal was registered using a ChemiDoc XRS + ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Western Blot images were analysed using the Image Lab software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) .

Three PCR replicates were made per sample . Relative expression of CD9 was calculated via the ΔΔ CT - method as the housekeeping gene . Primers sequences were taken from Boker and colleagues ( 2018 ) [ 28 ] . Viral production 6 - well plates were incubated with Poly - L - Ornithine Solution ( 0 . 01 % ) ( Merck Millipore ) for at least 1 hour at 37˚C before cell seeding . 600 , 000 cells per well from the appropriate cell lines were seeded 24 hours before transfection .

A BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer ( BD Biosciences ) was used to record at least 5 , 000 events per sample . The FITC LP505 - BP530 / 30 filter set was used for GFP detection . Data were recorded using the FACSDiva Software ( BD Biosciences ) and further analysed with FlowJo ( BD Biosciences ) . For microscopy analysis , 25 , 000 HEK 293T cell ( P < 25 ) per well were transduced with a viral titre of 10 6 / 10 7 in a 24 - well plate . 72 hours after transduction cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 1 : 2 , 000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and imaged with an Axio Observer Z1 ( Zeiss ) . 3 images per well were acquired using the 20X objective and a Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 . 0 camera . Laser intensity and exposure time were kept constant for the whole experiment . All transductions were done in duplicates . EVs markers analysis Cells adapted to SFM were centrifuged at 1 , 000 rpm for 5 min . 5 – 7 ml of supernatant were har - vested and further centrifuged at 2 , 000 g for 30 min to remove debris , mixed with 0 . 5 volumes of Total Exosome Isolation ( from cell culture media ) reagent ( Invitrogen ) and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . EVs were finally resuspended in 100 μ l PBS and protein concentration was estimated with a BCA assay . For subsequent WB analysis , a sample volume equivalent to 12 . 5 μ g protein content was diluted in Isolation Buffer ( PBS 0 . 1 % BSA , 0 . 2 μ m filtered ) , mixed with Exosome - Human CD9 Isolation Reagent ( from cell culture ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) or Exosome - Human CD63 Isolation / Detection Reagent ( from cell culture media ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and pro - cessed as per manufacturer’s instructions . At the end of the protocol , samples were resus - pended in lysis buffer and further prepared for loading ( see above ) . For flow cytometry , a sample volume equivalent to 25 μ g protein content was diluted in Iso - lation Buffer ( PBS 0 . 1 % BSA , 0 . 2 μ m filtered ) , mixed with Exosome - Human CD9 Isolation Reagent ( from cell culture ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , diluted 5 times ) or Exosome - Human CD63 Isolation / Detection Reagent ( from cell culture media ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and processed as per manufacturer’s instructions . Beads - bound exosomes were resuspended in 300 μ l Isolation Buffer . 100 μ l of each sample were then incubated with APC / Fire 750 anti - human CD9 Antibody 1 : 100 ( 312113 , BioLegend ) and PE anti - FOLR1 ( Folate Binding Pro - tein ) Antibody 1 : 50 ( 908303 , BioLegend ) for 1h on a shaker ( 1 , 000 rpm ) at RT .

Superna - tant was then mixed with 0 . 5 volumes of Total Exosome Isolation reagent and samples were further processed as per manufacturer’s instructions . Final resuspension of EVs pellets was in 200 μ l PBS . EVs concentration was measured with the ZetaView TWIN ( Particle Metrix PLOS ONE CD9 and folate receptor are not sufficient for lentiviral transduction PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0264642 March 10 , 2022 5 / 19 GmbH ) using the 488 nm laser in scatter modality . Sensitivity was set to 80 % , shutter to 100 units and temperature to 24˚C . Samples were diluted 1 : 50 to 1 : 200 in PBS and recorded in trip - licates ( Measurement Mode : Size Distribution , 3 Cycles , 11 Positions ) . EVs parameters were calculated by the ZetaView software ( Particle Metrix GmbH ) . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 ( GraphPad Software ) . Significance of difference between experimental groups was estimated using post - hoc tests of ANOVA ( details about the analysis are specified in the result section for each experiment ) . The thresh - old to accept statistical significance was set at alpha level 0 . 05 for all p - values . Results Establishment of CD9 - overexpressing lines To replicate experiments about CD9 effect on transduction efficiency , we established two cell lines that overexpressed CD9 . Using the same transfer plasmid ( pLenti6 . 3 - CD9 GFP ) to generate one of the two cell lines , we provided very similar conditions as previously reported [ 28 ] . The other line was created by transduction with pLenti6 . 3 - CD9 to exclude any possible GFP trans - fer from the fusion protein . CD9 expression was tested with qPCR and WB . qPCR results indi - cate a ΔΔ C q of - 8 . 82 ± 0 . 32 s . d . for the CD9 + line and - 9 . 17 ± 0 . 15 s . d . for the GFP - CD9 + line compared to the average of the WT samples ( 0 ± 0 . 02 s . d . ) , equivalent to a change in expression of 459 . 33 and 576 . 44 times respectively ( Fig 1A ) . p was < 0 . 0001 in both cases when comparing the ΔΔ C q of the experimental lines to WT cells ( Tukey’s multiple comparisons test post ordi - nary one - way ANOVA ) . There was no significant difference between the CD9 + and GFP - CD9 + lines . However , this huge increase in mRNA synthesis was not translated in a corresponding Fig 1 . Change of CD9 expression in CD9 + and GFP - CD9 + lines . ( A ) Expression of CD9 mRNA was estimated by qPCR .

( C ) Example of WB membrane stained for CD9 and HSP90 as loading control . Note that samples from the GFP - CD9 + cell line present 2 bands when anti - CD9 antibody is used : one band correspond to the endogenous protein , the other to the fusion GFP - CD9 protein . � = p � 0 . 05 ; �� = p � 0 . 01 ; ���� = p � 0 . 0001 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0264642 . g001 PLOS ONE CD9 and folate receptor are not sufficient for lentiviral transduction PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0264642 March 10 , 2022 6 / 19 protein overexpression . When expression levels were estimated via WB , in fact , the overex - pression was only of 3 . 11 ± 1 . 91 s . d . times for the CD9 + line and of 10 . 68 ± 5 . 31 s . d . times for the GFP - CD9 + line ( Fig 1B and 1C ) . Moreover , while there was a significant difference between WT ( 1 . 00 ± 0 . 67 s . d . ) and GFP - CD9 + line ( p = 0 . 0061 , Tukey’s multiple comparisons test post ordinary one - way ANOVA ) , the difference between WT and CD9 + cells was not sig - nificant . There was instead a significant ( p = 0 . 0239 ) difference between protein expression in the CD9 + and the GFP - CD9 + line . As previously reported [ 28 ] , expression of the fusion protein GFP - CD9 was localized to the cell membrane ( S1 Fig ) . Characterization of EVs To further confirm increased CD9 expression in our newly generated lines , we selectively iso - lated CD9 + and CD63 + EVs using commercially available immunofunctionalized beads . Sam - ples were stained with an anti - CD9 antibody and analysed by flow cytometry . After isolation with anti - CD9 beads , there was a significant increase in the percentage of CD9 + particles in samples from CD9 + and GFP - CD9 + cells compared to WT ( Fig 2A , WT = 84 . 75 % ± 7 . 00 s . d . ; CD9 + = 99 . 61 % ± 0 . 30 s . d . p = 0 . 0098 ; GFP - CD9 + = 99 . 86 % ± 0 . 1058 p = 0 . 0090 , Tukey’s multi - ple comparisons test post ordinary one - way ANOVA ) . As can be observed in Fig 2D – 2F , intensity of CD9 - staining was also higher in CD9 + and GFP - CD9 + samples . As expected , no GFP + particle was detected in samples from WT ( 0 . 05 % ± 0 . 06 s . d . ) and CD9 + ( 0 . 01 % ± 0 . 01 s . d . ) cells ( Fig 2B ) , while all events recorded in GFP - CD9 + samples were GFP + ( 99 . 81 % ± 0 . 16 s . d . , p < 0 . 0001 compared to the other groups ) . Similar results were obtained when comparing percentage of double stained particles ( Fig 2C , WT = 0 . 01 % ± 0 . 012 ; CD9 + = 0 . 01 % ± 0 . 01 s . d . ; GFP - CD9 + = 99 . 80 % ± 0 . 17 s . d . ) . Particles isolated with anti - CD63 beads showed again a significant difference in the per - centage of CD9 + events ( Fig 2G , WT = 58 . 27 % ± 13 . 11 s . d . ; CD9 + = 98 . 54 ± 0 . 16 s . d . ; GFP - CD9 + = 94 . 10 % ± 4 . 47 s . d . ; WT vs . CD9 + p = 0 . 0020 , WT vs . GFP - CD9 + p = 0 . 0037 ) . While GFP + events were detected again only in samples from GFP - CD9 + cells ( Fig 2H ) , their percentage was lower than before ( 78 . 38 % ± 8 . 902 s . d . ) . The same was observed for double stained particles ( Fig 2I , 78 . 30 % ± 8 . 97 s . d . ) . In fact , in Fig 2L a small percentage of events can be seen that were CD9 + but GFP - in EVs from GFP - CD9 + cells . Transduction efficiency is not influenced by CD9 We tested LVs produced in the CD9 + and GFP - CD9 + lines against virus produced in WT cells for differences in transduction efficiency . We found no statistical difference in transduc - tion efficiency assessed by the percentage of GFP positive cells between CD9 + and WT virus samples ( Fig 3A ; WT 49 . 51 % ± 35 . 63 s . d . ; CD9 + 32 . 81 % ± 26 . 59 s . d . ; GFP - CD9 + 58 . 22 ± 30 . 46 s . d . ; p > 0 . 05 according to Sidak’s multiple comparisons test post Repeated Measures one - way ANOVA ) . More importantly , we were never able to observe any transduction when VSV - G was not present as a pseudotyping protein on the LVs . In addition , we confirmed our flow cytometry results by fluorescent microscopy ( Fig 3B ) . FR α is present on CD9 + and CD63 + EVs At last , we wanted to test if expression of FR α on its own or in combination with CD9 effects LVs transduction efficiency . We first confirmed coexpression of the target proteins on EVs . In fact , small EVs are a heterologous population of cell - derived vesicles : expression of protein markers such as tetraspanins can vary between them [ 36 ] . To verify that FR α is not only directed to EVs but is also coexpressed on CD9 + vesicles , we used wild - type HEK 293 ( WT ) PLOS ONE CD9 and folate receptor are not sufficient for lentiviral transduction PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0264642 March 10 , 2022 7 / 19 Fig 2 .

Additionally , we gener - ated a cell line overexpressing both FR α and CD9 ( FR α + / CD9 + line ) . Increased expression of the target proteins in the new line was verified by WB ( S2 Fig ) . We then used immunofunctio - nalized beads to specifically isolate CD9 + or CD63 + EVs from these cells . We tested the obtained EVs populations for the presence of FR α and CD9 . FR α was not detectable by WB in EVs obtained from WT cells , but was found in both CD9 + and CD63 + EVs populations from FR α + and FR α + / CD9 + cells ( Fig 4A ) . Coherently , there was a statistically significant differ - ence between cell lines in staining for FR α when EVs were analysed with flow cytometry . For EVs isolated by using anti - CD9 beads ( Fig 4B and 4E – 4G ) , 99 . 51 % ± 0 . 26 s . d . of particles from FR α + cells and 99 . 96 % ± 0 . 05 s . d . from FR α + / CD9 + cells were stained for FR α against 0 . 18 % ± 0 . 18 s . d . from WT cells ( p < 0 . 0001 in both cases , Tukey’s multiple comparisons test post ANOVA ) . Results were replicated when using anti - CD63 beads for purification ( Fig 5A and 5D – 5F , p < 0 . 0001 for both WT vs FR α + and WT vs FR α + / CD9 + ) . When considering staining for CD9 , there was a statistically significant increase ( p < 0 . 0001 ) in EVs from FR α + / CD9 + cells ( 99 . 33 % ± 0 . 70 s . d . ) compared to vesicles from the other lines ( WT = 5 . 36 % ± 3 . 66 s . d . ; FR α = 2 . 78 % ± 1 . 02 s . d . ) after isolation with anti - CD9 beads ( Fig 4C ) . An increase in CD9 staining in EVs from FR α + / CD9 + cells was detected also after isolation using anti - CD63 beads ( 89 . 99 % ± 15 . 07 s . d . vs 56 . 17 % ± 18 . 99 s . d . of WT and 54 . 80 % ± 5 . 97 s . d . of FR α ) , albeit it was not statistically significant ( Fig 5B ) . Finally , looking only at double stained particles , almost all EVs from FR α + / CD9 + cells car - ried both targets after either isolation protocol ( Figs 4D and 5C , anti - CD9 = 99 . 33 % ± 0 . 70 s . d . , anti - CD63 = 87 . 00 % ± 19 . 08 s . d . ) . This was not observed in the other cell lines ( anti - CD9 : FR α + / CD9 + vs WT and FR α + / CD9 + vs FR α + p < 0 . 0001 ; anti - CD63 : FR α + / CD9 + vs WT p = 0 . 0002 , FR α + / CD9 + vs FR α + p = 0 . 0327 ) . FR α does not influence EVs secretion rate Constitutive expression of CD9 was reported to cause an increase in EVs secretion , while other EVs markers led to a lower EVs output [ 28 ] . To check if FR α has an influence on EVs production , we isolated EVs from the WT , FR α + and FR α + / CD9 + cell lines and measured the sample concentration with Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis ( NTA ) . We found no significant difference in EVs output between WT ( 5 . 86 � 10 9 ± 2 . 45 � 10 9 s . d . particles / ml ) and FR α + ( 5 . 17 � 10 9 ± 2 . 33 � 10 9 s . d . particles / ml ) samples , indicating that overexpression of FR α per se does not influence EVs secretion ( Fig 6A ) . Coherently with what was previously reported [ 28 ] , we observed a twofold increase in EVs production in presence of CD9 overexpression ( 1 . 12 � 10 10 ± 5 . 50 � 10 9 s . d . particles / ml , vs WT p = 0 . 0267 , vs FR α + p = 0 . 0395 , Tukey’s multiple comparisons test post Repeated Measures one - way ANOVA ) . No VSV - G - independent transduction was detectable To test the effect of FR α and CD9 on lentiviral transduction efficiency , we produced GFP - car - rying LVs using either WT , FR α + or FR α + / CD9 + cells . We assessed the viral transduction by detecting the percentage of fluorescent cells using flow cytometry ( Fig 6B ) . SEW _ - SFFVU3 _ GFP was used as a transfer plasmid . We found again no statistically significant differ - ence in transduction efficiency between viruses produced in either cell line ( Sidak’s multiple CD63 - beads .

Moreover , when VSV - G was not pres - ent as envelope protein , no transduction at all was observed , independently of the expression levels of CD9 ( see also S3 Fig ) . Discussion Our study aimed to identify mammalian proteins that are able to mediate transduction of len - tiviral particles when expressed in the viral envelope . Two possible candidate proteins , CD9 and FR α , were investigated . At first we wanted to replicate results previously reported by Boker and colleagues concerning CD9 - mediated VSV - G - independent viral transduction . We established two HEK 293T CD9 overexpressing cell lines following closely their protocol . Flow cytometry characterization of EVs isolated from these lines confirmed the increase of CD9 expression in both CD9 + and CD63 + EVs populations . Surprisingly , when anti - CD9 beads were used for the isolation , a small percentage of particles in the WT samples were not stained for CD9 . Since CD9 was used to isolate these samples , all particles should be positive for this marker . A possible explanation is that antibodies attached to the beads may compete with fluo - rescently labelled anti - CD9 antibodies for CD9 binding sites . This would suggest the presence Fig 5 .

When anti - CD63 beads were used , around 58 % of the WT particles were stained CD9 + , indicating the presence of CD9 - EVs populations . In addition , analysing GFP - CD9 + samples we observed a small CD9 + / GFP - population . This can be explained by discrepancies in sorting of native CD9 and GFP - CD9 fusion protein in CD63 + EVs populations , but it could also be caused by a difference in the strength of the antibody signal compared to the fluorescent protein . We used our newly established lines to produce CD9 - enriched LVs . Unexpectedly , our experiments showed that in absence of VSV - G , there was no detectable transduction . In addi - tion , we failed to record an increase in transduction efficiency when VSV - G was present , even if our protocols followed closely the ones previously reported [ 28 ] . Further , we investigated if FR α was able to affect the transduction efficiency , on its own or in combination with CD9 . Therefore , we established a FR α / CD9 overexpressing line starting from HEK 293 . In our previous study , we have demonstrated that FR α - expressing EVs can be selectively isolated from the cell culture supernatant [ 35 ] . However , it was possible that FR α was only expressed by a restricted subpopulation of EVs , thus rendering it less efficient for EVs isolation then other more general markers . In this study , we demonstrated that , when constitutively expressed , FR α is carried by CD63 + and CD9 + EVs , which are traditionally considered EVs markers [ 29 , 37 ] . The fact that samples from the FR α + and FR α + / CD9 + cell lines were posi - tively stained for FR α independently from the type of functionalized beads that were used , confirms that FR α is coexpressed with established EVs markers . Concerning the flow cytometry results , it is interesting to note that there is a major differ - ence between the number of CD9 + events in WT EVs when the sample was isolated using either anti - CD63 or anti - CD9 beads . When anti - CD63 beads were used , around 56 % of the WT particles were stained CD9 + , coherently with what we observed in the WT HEK 293T . In Fig 6 .

This could suggest that the majority of EVs produced by WT HEK 293 express lower levels of CD9 than EVs derived from WT HEK 293T . In contrast , when CD9 was overexpressed in our FR α + / CD9 + line , almost all detected particles were stained for it independently of the type of beads that were used to purify the samples . This indicates that overexpression of CD9 results in the presence of CD9 in the membrane of EVs . FR α also failed to affect the LVs transduction efficiency , even in combination with high lev - els of CD9 expression . Our results indicate that overexpression of CD9 on its own is not sufficient to increase trans - duction efficiency , unlike the results obtained previously [ 28 ] . In their paper , Boker and col - leagues argued that the enhanced number of EVs secreted by CD9 - enriched cells was not the key factor in increasing the LVs transduction efficiency , since adding external exosomes to the LVs had a negative effect on transduction . Our results confirmed the CD9 - dependent rise in EVs pro - duction but failed to demonstrate any increase in LVs transduction efficiency . The discrepancies in transduction competence could be explained by several factors . Although we tried to strictly reproduce their protocols , some experimental factors still differed . First of all , we used a different packaging plasmid for LVs production : psPAX2 and pCMV - dR8 . 91 are both second generation plasmids and share similar architecture and gene compositions [ 38 ] , but there could be differ - ences in efficiency of virus production . For example , a recent study showed that pCMV - dR8 . 2 dvpr was able to stimulate a lentivirus production at least 7 times stronger than psPAX2 [ 39 ] . However , since we always used the same titre of virus for transduction , this should not affect transduction efficiency per se . Further , the cell line used to produce the LVs might determine sev - eral characteristics of the EVs . The protein composition of EVs depends on the secreting cell type [ 40 ] and one cell type may produce different subpopulations of EVs [ 41 ] . EVs composition also changes in pathological conditions and thus can be exploited as potential diagnostic biomarkers , mostly in cancer [ 42 ] but also in other pathological conditions [ 43 ] . While we overexpressed CD9 and GFP - CD9 in HEK 293T cells , Boker and colleagues used the HEK 293FT line . For the estab - lishment of FR α expressing cells , we used HEK 293 cells . The major difference between HEK 293T and HEK 293FT is the faster metabolism and therefore enhanced growing rate of the latter one . Both lines express the SV40 large T - Antigen that is not present in the original HEK 293 line . The faster metabolism of HEK 293FT might lead to a higher LV release rate . However , since we used the same virus titre for transduction this should not matter . Possibly , some particular charac - teristic of the EVs secreted by HEK 293FT could be present in combination with CD9 overexpres - sion to mediate transduction . Our flow cytometry results suggest a difference in CD9 expression on EVs derived either from WT HEK 293 and or from HEK 293T cells , as discussed above . Con - sequently , we assume that even cell lines that are as close as HEK 293 , 293T and 293FT can show differences in their EVs composition . Another difference between our experiments and the ones of the reference study could be found in the levels of CD9 expression that were obtained in the stable cell lines . When looking at qPCR results , we obtained a much bigger increase in CD9 expression than the previous study using the pLenti6 . 3 - CD9 GFP plasmid ( 576 - fold increase versus 22 - fold ) . On the other hand , we verified by WB that the CD9 expression did only slightly increase . This discrepancy between mRNA and proteins levels has recently been substantiated by omics studies indicating that protein abundance only partly correlates with mRNA increase [ 44 ] . The amount of CD9 that is actually translated could be limited by the cells on a post - transcriptional level . For example , it is known that miR - 518f - 5p decreases CD9 levels in some types of cancer cells [ 45 , 46 ] . Moreover , the fact that similar increases in mRNA synthesis between the CD9 + and GFP - CD9 + lines were associated with significant differences in CD9 protein expression PLOS ONE CD9 and folate receptor are not sufficient for lentiviral transduction PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0264642 March 10 , 2022 14 / 19 suggests that the fusion protein is subjected to distinct post - transcriptional regulation and metabolic degradation in comparison to WT CD9 . It might therefore be misleading to make comparisons between cell lines only based on qPCR data . It is theoretically possible that differ - ent cell lines tolerate different levels of CD9 to be translated and that VSV - G - independent transduction can happen only when a certain level of CD9 is reached and / or coincides with the expression of other proteins . Finally , it is possible that Boker and colleagues did not observe proper transduction events . If we consider that their GFP - CD9 + line had a higher EVs secretion rate , but the obtained len - tivirus titre was the same as the one from WT cells , we can hypothesize that these cells pro - duced an excess of non - lentiviral EVs . It is also possible that a higher EVs secretion rate could increase the likelihood of cytosolic proteins like GFP and RFP to be passively loaded into EVs . Those vesicles would have been collected and concentrated together with the virus . Since a constant virus titre was used in transduction experiments , only cells transduced with the GFP - CD9 + viruses would have received a higher number of EVs . Consequently , it’s possible that CD9 , increasing EVs production , had the effect of increasing the probability of EV - medi - ated delivery of the fluorescent protein without any direct effect on transduction efficiency . Boker and colleagues did not report the exact percentage of transduced cells they observed when VSV - G was omitted , but they stated that it was “a minor proportion” . That would be in line with recent reports demonstrating that EV - cargo - delivery is very inefficient [ 47 ] . Since we always obtained very high virus titres we directly used the cell supernatant for transduction experiments . It is possible that we did not apply enough EVs carrying fluorescent proteins to observe fluorescent cells . Another possibility is that some vesicle degradation occurred during the virus concentration step , releasing the fluorescent proteins contained in EVs . Once again , since virus samples from the GFP - CD9 + cell line would contain more EVs , they would poten - tially carry more contaminants . Cases of pseudotransduction caused by co - purified protein during the concentration step were observed in the past [ 48 ] . Since we did not perform a con - centration step , we have avoided this kind of pseudotransduction . In conclusion , we confirmed that the mechanism of increase in EVs production depends on CD9 expression . On the other hand , we could neither confirm a function of CD9 as viral - inde - pendent transduction mediator nor demonstrate a positive effect of FR α on the transduction effi - ciency . Our results confirm recent studies reporting that only EVs modified with a fusogenic protein such as VSV - G could deliver their cargo to cells at detectable levels [ 49 , 50 ] . Moreover , even when rare cargo - delivery events could be detected with a CRISPR / Cas9 reporter system , EV - mediated RNA transfer was not observed when HEK 293T cells were used as EVs donor [ 47 ] . Although we did not achieve the hoped results in this study , we remain convinced of the potential held by the expression of EVs markers on LVs surface for transduction . Until now , strategies for LVs pseudotyping only focused on viral glycoproteins from different viruses [ 51 ] . The same proteins ( or portions of them ) have also been expressed on the surface of EVs in the attempt to increase specific targeting , for example to the brain [ 52 ] . On the other hand , EVs are meant to be taken up by cells and some of them show preferred targeting to certain cell types or tissues . As we discover more and more about the mechanisms that endogenously regulate EVs uptake and targeting [ 53 ] , new candidate proteins may emerge . Expression of endogenous markers instead of immunogenic viral proteins on LVs surface has the potential of opening the way to a new class of gene therapy vectors with increased safety and efficacy .
