The majority of resistance is thought to reside in the juxtacanalicular connective tissue ( JCT ) region of the trabecular meshwork and is modulated by the inner wall ( IW ) endothelial cells of Schlemm ’ s canal ( SC ) . The IW cells form connections with the underlying JCT cells / matrix , and these connections are thought to modulate out ﬂ ow resistance . Two ways by which AH crosses the IW endothelium are through : 1 ) the formation of outpouchings in IW cells called giant vacuoles ( GVs ) and their intracellular pores ( I - pores ) , and 2 ) intercellular pores between two adjacent IW cells ( B - pores ) . AH out ﬂ ow is segmental with areas of high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow around the circumference of the eye . To investigate whether changes in cellular connectivity play a role in segmental out ﬂ ow regulation , we used global imaging , serial block - face scanning electron microscopy ( SBF - SEM ) , and 3D reconstruction to examine individual IW cells from different ﬂ ow areas of ex vivo perfused normal human donor eyes . Speci ﬁ cally , we investigated the differences in cellular dimensions , connections with JCT cells / matrix , GVs , and pores in SC IW cells between high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas . Our data showed that : 1 ) IW cell - JCT cell / matrix connectivity was signi ﬁ cantly decreased in the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas compared to those in low - and non - ﬂ ow areas ; 2 ) GVs in the cells of high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections beneath them compared to GVs in the cells of low - and non - ﬂ ow areas ; 3 ) Type IV GVs ( with I - pores and basal openings ) had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections beneath them compared to Type I GVs ( no I - pore or basal opening ) . Our results suggest that a decreased number of cellular connections between the IW and JCT in high - ﬂ ow areas is associated with increased numbers of GVs with I - pores and larger Type IV GVs observed in previous studies .

The only modi ﬁ able risk factor for POAG is intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Elevated IOP results from a disequilibrium between aqueous humor ( AH ) production and drainage ( AGIS Investigators , 2000 ) , which results from increased resistance to AH drainage in the trabecular out ﬂ ow pathway . The majority of resistance is thought to reside in the juxtacanalicular connective tissue ( JCT ) region of the trabecular meshwork ( TM ) and is modulated by the inner wall ( IW ) endothelial cells of Schlemm ’ s canal ( SC ) ( Grant , 1958 , 1963 ; Maepea and Bill , 1989 ; Johnson et al . , 1992 ; Maepea and Bill , 1992 ; Overby et al . , 2009 ; Vahabikashi et al . , 2019 ) . The mechanisms by which the JCT and IW of SC interact and modify out ﬂ ow resistance are still unclear . The IW endothelium of SC is held together by tight junctions ( Raviola and Raviola , 1981 ; Bhatt et al . , 1995 ) . One mechanism by which AH crosses the IW endothelium is through small openings , or intercellular pores , that form between adjacent IW cells ( B - pores ) ( Ethier et al . , 1998 ) . Another mechanism by which AH passes through this endothelial monolayer is through giant vacuoles ( GVs ) , which are outpouchings ﬁ lled with AH that form by AH pushing against the basal side of the IW cells to form an invagination known as a basal opening ( Tripathi , 1971 ) . AH exits the GVs through intracellular pores ( I - pores ) on the luminal surface of the GV ( Ethier et al . , 1998 ) . I - pores are thought to form in the cellular lining around the GVs as the GVs ﬁ ll with AH and increase in size ( Tripathi , 1972 ; Braakman et al . , 2014 ) . A previous study has shown that GVs with I - pores are larger and have thinner cellular lining around the GVs compared to GVs without I - pores ( Swain et al . , 2021 ) . The I - pores allow AH to pass from the JCT through the GV and into the lumen of SC ( Johnson and Erickson , 2000 ; Swain et al . , 2021 ) . The factors that in ﬂ uence GV and pore formation are not fully understood and warrant further investigation . Previous studies have shown that ﬂ ow of AH through the out ﬂ ow pathway around the circumference of the eye is segmental , or non - uniform , by perfusing ﬂ uorescently - labeled tracers or dyes into enucleated eyes ( Lu et al . , 2008 ; Lu et al . , 2011 ; Yang et al . , 2013 ; Vranka et al . , 2015 ; Cha et al . , 2016 ; Huang et al . , 2016 ; Ren et al . , 2016 ; Swain et al . , 2021 ) or living eyes ( Huang et al . , 2017a ; Huang et al . , 2017b ; Huang et al . , 2018 ) . Previous studies of these speci ﬁ c areas of active and inactive ﬂ ow have attempted to understand their morphological and molecular differences . One study examined TM endothelial cell speci ﬁ c differences using primary cells isolated from active and inactive areas and found differences in adhesion proteins and metalloproteinase inhibitors ( Staverosky et al . , 2020 ) . Another study in our lab found that the number of GVs with I - pores and basal openings was greater in high - ﬂ ow areas compared to low - and non - ﬂ ow areas ( Swain et al . , 2021 ) . However , these studies did not examine SC IW cells and their interactions with the underlying JCT cells and matrix . Current treatment for POAG aims to maintain IOP within a normal range by decreasing AH production or increasing drainage of AH through uveal out ﬂ ow pathways . A relatively new medication is netarsudil , a rho - kinase inhibitor , that targets the trabecular out ﬂ ow pathway . Netarsudil has been shown to increase the amount of effective ﬁ ltration area ( EFA ) around the circumference of the eye , which correlated with increased out ﬂ ow facility ( Ren et al . , 2016 ) . Other studies with rho - kinase inhibitors have shown that an increase in out ﬂ ow facility is associated with physical separation between the IW of SC and the JCT in porcine , bovine , and monkey eyes ( Rao et al . , 2001 ; Lu et al . , 2008 ; Lu et al . , 2011 ) , and expansion of the JCT in human eyes , which is also associated with increased active ﬂ ow areas ( Yang et al . , 2013 ; Gong and Yang , 2014 ; Ren et al . , 2016 ) . One hypothesis is that the expansion observed with rho - kinase inhibitor treatment is due to the targeted release of cellular connections between SC IW cells and underlying JCT matrix and cells . Whether the connectivity between these cell types differs in active and inactive ﬂ ow areas has not previously been investigated . Previous transmission electron microscopy studies have categorized the various types of connections between SC IW endothelial cells and underlying JCT cells / matrix ( Grierson et al . , 1978 ; Lai et al . , 2019 ) . We previously used serial block - face scanning electron microscopy ( SBF - SEM ) to quantify the total number of connections on 3D - reconstructed individual IW cells and to investigate their differences between immersion - and perfusion - ﬁ xed ( 15 mmHg ) eyes . We found that the number of IW - JCT connections signi ﬁ cantly decreased in IW cells of perfusion - ﬁ xed eyes compared to IW cells from immersion - ﬁ xed eyes ( Lai et al . , 2019 ) . Additionally , GVs were much larger and had I - pores in the IW cells from perfusion - ﬁ xed eyes , whereas no I - pores were found in IW cells from immersion - ﬁ xed eyes . However , this study did not compare differences between IW cells in different ﬂ ow - type areas . IW endothelial cells also connect to their adjacent IW cells through tight junctions ( Raviola and Raviola , 1981 ; Bhatt et al . , 1995 ) . Studies have shown that the tight junctions simplify in response to increased pressure , and this simpli ﬁ cation may promote B - pore formation and allow greater paracellular ﬂ ow ( Ye et al . , 1997 ) . The overlap between adjacent IW cells also decreases with increased pressure ( Ye et al . , 1997 ) . Our previous study in immersion - and perfusion - ﬁ xed eyes found that B - pores only formed in areas where the overlap between adjacent IW cells was reduced to zero ( Lai et al . , 2019 ) . However , this previous study did not examine the overlap between adjacent IW cells in different ﬂ ow - type areas .

SC Connectivity Regulates Segmental Flow The aim of this study was to use SBF - SEM and subsequent 3D - reconstruction to investigate differences in cellular connectivity between 3D - reconstructed IW cells and their underlying JCT cells / matrix and between adjacent IW cells in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas of human eyes perfusion - ﬁ xed at 15 mmHg , in order to understand how changes in cellular connections may play a role in GV and pore formation and the regulation of segmental out ﬂ ow . 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 Human Donor Eyes Two normal human donor eyes ( Eye 1 : 32 years - old ; Eye 2 : 80 years - old ) without traceable identity and any known history of ocular disease or surgery were received from the Miracles in Sight Eye Bank ( Winston - Salem , NC , United States ) within 24 h post - mortem . All eyes were managed according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines on research involving human tissue and the Boston University Medical Center Institutional Review Board . The eyes were con ﬁ rmed to be grossly normal under a dissecting microscope . 2 . 2 Ocular Perfusion and Fixation The perfusion procedure has been described in detail previously ( Scott et al . , 2009 ) . All eyes were perfused with Dulbecco ’ s phosphate - buffered saline ( pH 7 . 3 ; Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY , United States ) containing 5 . 5 mM D - glucose ( collectively referred as GPBS ) for 30 min at 15 mmHg using pressure - controlled hydraulic pumps to establish a stable baseline facility ( Eye 1 : 0 . 263 μ L / min / mmHg ; Eye 2 : 0 . 318 ) . Eyes were exchanged and perfused with a ﬁ xed volume ( 200 µL ) of red ﬂ uorescent tracers ( size : 200 nm ; Catalog number : F8810 ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Waltham , MA , United States ) and perfusion - ﬁ xed at the same pressure with modi ﬁ ed Karnovsky ’ s ﬁ xative ( 2 % glutaraldehyde in 2 % paraformaldehyde ) for 30 min . Eyes were immersed in the same ﬁ xative overnight . 2 . 3 Global Imaging and Ocular Dissection Global imaging was performed , as described previously ( Cha et al . , 2016 ) to visualize the out ﬂ ow pattern along the entire TM and episcleral veins . Each ﬁ xed globe ( n = 2 ) was cut into anterior and posterior segments through the equator , followed by careful removal of the lens , vitreous body , iris , cornea ( with a 10 - mm trephine ) , and excess conjunctiva . Anterior segments were imaged en face on both the TM and scleral surfaces with a ﬁ xed exposure time ( 5 s ) using a 300 mm lens on a 4000 MP VersaDock imaging system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories , Hercules , CA , United States ) with Quantity One imaging software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . From global images , ﬂ ow - type areas were designated qualitatively based on the relative amount of ﬂ uorescence as follows : 1 ) high - ﬂ ow , bright ﬂ uorescence on both anterior ( episcleral veins ) and posterior ( TM ) sides of anterior segments ; 2 ) low - ﬂ ow , intermediate ﬂ uorescence on both posterior and anterior sides ; 3 ) non - ﬂ ow , no visible ﬂ uorescence on either anterior or posterior sides . Global images of these eyes have been published previously ( Swain et al . , 2021 ) . Two radial wedges ( 2 × 2 × 2 mm ) of tissue from each ﬂ ow - type area were shipped to Cleveland Clinic ( Cleveland , OH , United States ) for SBF - SEM . 2 . 4 Serial Block - Face Scanning Electron Microscopy and 3D Reconstruction Wedges were processed for SBF - SEM using a previously described method ( Deerinck et al . , 2010 ; Swain et al . , 2021 ) . In brief , tissues were post - ﬁ xed with OsO4 / K ferrocyanide and thiocarbohydrazide and en - bloc stained with uranyl acetate and lead aspartate . SC and the TM were identi ﬁ ed in each block and imaged using a Zeiss Sigma VP serial block - face scanning electron microscope equipped with a Gatan 3View in - chamber ultramicrotome stage ( Gatan , Inc . , Pleasanton , CA , United States ) and low - kV backscattered electron detectors optimized for 3View systems . Images were taken of each block face . Each image had a pixel size of 0 . 0101 µm × 0 . 0101 µm , and each section was 0 . 13 µm in thickness . The image ﬁ eld size was 141 μ m x 60 – 71 µm . The total number of images was 11 , 334 for six blocks of tissue , and the mean number of images per sample was 1889 . Image sets were compiled and aligned for analysis . 2 . 5 Morphometric Analyses Using Reconstruct ( Fiala , 2005 ) , 11 , 334 SBF - SEM images were screened to identify SC IW cells ( n = 15 ) from each ﬂ ow - type area that were completely within the imaging ﬁ eld ( total : 45 cells ) . All of the following morphometric analyses were performed twice , either by two investigators individually or by one investigator twice with 2 weeks between trials with less than 10 % difference between trials or investigators ( DLS , SY , BF , GL ) . For each IW cell , GVs were identi ﬁ ed and counted ( Figure 1A ) . I - pores were identi ﬁ ed as openings in the cellular lining surrounding the GVs that had a clear separation with smooth borders ( Figure 1B ) . Exclusion criteria included openings in the cellular lining that were in line with knife marks from the sectioning process or appeared rough with jagged edges . GVs were typed according to previous studies ( Grierson and Lee , 1978 ; Koudouna et al . , 2019 ; Swain et al . , 2021 ) : Type I : no basal opening or I - pore , Type II : basal opening , no I - pore ; Type III : I - pore , no basal opening ; Type IV : both basal opening and I - pore . The percentages of each GV type were determined . Volumes of GVs were determined from the manual segmentation using the Volume Tool in Reconstruct . B - pores were identi ﬁ ed as clear openings between the reconstructed cell and either of its adjacent neighboring IW cells where the cell borders clearly separate ( Figures 1D – F ) . 2 . 5 . 1 Schlemm ’ s Canal Endothelial Cell Dimensions : Length , Width , Thickness , Volume Methods for measuring IW dimensions have been described previously ( Lai et al . , 2019 ) . Using Reconstruct , cell length was measured for each reconstructed IW endothelial cell in the z - dimension , along the major axis , from the ﬁ rst image in which the cell appeared to the last section using the Z - trace function . The IW cell width was measured in two ways : 1 ) in nuclear regions , measured once on the section with the largest Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org April 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 867376 3 Swain et al . SC Connectivity Regulates Segmental Flow cross - sectional area ( CSA ) of the nucleus ( Figure 2A ) ; 2 ) in non - nuclear regions , measured every 40 sections throughout the length of the cell where the nucleus was not present ( Figure 2B ) . To account for the curvature of the IW , a segmented line with up to three segments was used for IW cell width measurements . The IW cell thickness ( i . e . , basal - to - apical height ) was measured in both nuclear and non - nuclear regions . In nuclear regions , one measurement was made on the section with the largest CSA of the nucleus . In non - nuclear regions , a measurement was made every 40 sections throughout the length of the cell where the nucleus and GVs were not present , and the average of these measurements was used to calculate the mean thickness per cell ( Figure 2C ) . The IW cell volume was calculated using the Volume Tool in Reconstruct , and because the cell traces encompassed the GVs , the volumes of the GVs were subtracted to determine the cell volumes . 2 . 5 . 2 IW / JCT Connections Connections between SC IW cells and underlying JCT cells / matrix were manually counted for every cell . Connections FIGURE1 | Giantvacuoles and twotypes ofpores . ( A – C ) : Serialelectron micrographs showingagiant vacuole ( GV ) withanI - pore ( arrowhead ) and basalopening ( arrow ) .

SC Connectivity Regulates Segmental Flow were categorized into seven types , based on previous studies ( Grierson et al . , 1978 ; Lai et al . , 2019 ) : Type 1 : IW cell process - to - JCT ECM ; Type 2 : IW cell process - to - JCT cell body ; Type 3 : IW cell tongue - in - JCT groove of cell body ; Type 4 : IW cell process - to - JCT cell process ; Type 5 : JCT cell process - to - IW cell body ; Type 6 : JCT cell tongue - in - IW groove of cell body ; Type 7 : IW cell body - to - JCT cell body ( Figure 3 ) . Types 1 – 6 were counted as connections if the projections from the cells had a height that measured at least 0 . 3 µm from the cell body , as measured on the SBF - SEM image in Reconstruct . Type 7 connections were counted if the area of contact was at least 0 . 5 µm 2 . For each GV for each cell , the number of total connections beneath the GVs was determined by examining each section in which the GV appeared and counting the connections . The ratio of the total number of connections beneath each GV to the GV volume was determined for GV types I - IV in order to examine the relationship between connections , GV size , and GV type ( i . e . , presence of an I - pore / basal opening ) . We accounted for volume , because previous studies have shown that these GV types have signi ﬁ cantly different median volumes ( Swain et al . , 2021 ) . Due to the relatively small number of GV Types III and IV in different ﬂ ow - type areas , this analysis was conducted using all GVs from all cells . 2 . 5 . 3 IW / IW Overlap and B - Pores The connectivity between adjacent IW cells was quanti ﬁ ed by measuring the overlap length ( OL ) . Overlap length between the reconstructed IW cells and their adjacent IW cells was measured for each cell on every 40 sections through the entire cell length on both sides of the cell . These values were averaged to ﬁ nd the mean OL for each cell . On each image , OL was measured if the borders of the adjacent IW cell were parallel or within 45 ° of the axis of the IW ( Figure 4 ) . Cell borders that were perpendicular or at least > 45 ° away from the axis of the IW were not counted as OL . For each B - pore , OL was also measured on sections before and after the pore was present to determine the amount of OL around B - pores . This OL was compared to the average OL for each cell on which the B - pore was found . 2 . 6 Statistical Methods All data are listed as mean ± SEM , except GV volumes , which are reported as medians and interquartile ranges ( IQR ) . All statistical analyses were performed using R statistical computing package ( v3 . 5 . 1 ; R Foundation for Statistical Computing , Vienna , Austria ) . One - way ANOVA tests were performed to analyze differences in cell dimensions , connections , and overlap between ﬂ ow - type areas with post - hoc Tukey HSD tests for pairwise comparisons . For ratios of total cellular connections beneath a GV - to - GV volume , Kruskal - Wallis tests were used with post - hoc Wilcoxon rank - sum tests for pairwise comparisons between GV types , due to small sample size for type III GVs . 3 RESULTS Overall , a total of 45 IW cells were reconstructed ( 15 from each ﬂ ow - type area ) . These cells had 234 GVs , 41 I - pores , and 12 B - pores with adjacent IW cells . These counts , mean pores / cell , and percentages of GVs with I - pores in three different ﬂ ow - type areas are summarized in Table 1 . Examples of 3D - reconstructed cells are shown in Figure 5 . 3 . 1 IW Cell Dimensions : Length , Width , Thickness , and Volume 3 . 1 . 1 Length Mean length of SC IW cells was 70 . 76 ± 4 . 78 µm , 108 . 56 ± 9 . 68 µm , and 79 . 68 ± 6 . 38 µm in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively ( Figure 6A ) . Mean lengths differed signi ﬁ cantly by ﬂ ow - type area ( ANOVA , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the cells in the low - ﬂ ow area were signi ﬁ cantly longer than those in high - ( p = 0 . 02 ) and non - ﬂ ow areas ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) .

SC Connectivity Regulates Segmental Flow 3 . 1 . 2 Width The mean width of SC IW cells measured at the section with the largest cross - sectional area of the nucleus ( nuclear width ) was 10 . 05 ± 0 . 73 µm , 12 . 41 ± 1 . 03 µm , 9 . 06 ± 0 . 82 µm in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively , and these differed signi ﬁ cantly ( ANOVA , p = 0 . 03 ; Figure 6B ) . Speci ﬁ cally , in nuclear regions , the IW cells were signi ﬁ cantly wider in low - ﬂ ow areas than those in non - ﬂ ow areas ( p = 0 . 02 ) . The mean non - nuclear width of SC IW cells was 5 . 72 ± 0 . 56 µm , 6 . 90 ± 0 . 45 µm , 4 . 18 ± 0 . 30 µm in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively , and these differed signi ﬁ cantly ( ANOVA , p ≤ 0 . 01 ; Figure 6B ) . Speci ﬁ cally , in non - nuclear regions , IW cells in low - ﬂ ow areas were signi ﬁ cantly wider than the cells in non - ﬂ ow areas ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . The mean non - nuclear width of IW cells in high - ﬂ ow areas was not quite signi ﬁ cantly wider compared to IW cells in non - ﬂ ow areas ( p = 0 . 05 ) . 3 . 1 . 3 Thickness The mean thickness of SC IW cells in nuclear regions was 6 . 19 ± 0 . 67 µm , 4 . 50 ± 0 . 38 µm , 7 . 07 ± 1 . 08 µm in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively , and these did not differ signi ﬁ cantly ( ANOVA , p = 0 . 06 ; Figure 6C ) . The thickness of SC IW cells in non - nuclear regions was 0 . 68 ± 0 . 08 µm , 0 . 62 ± 0 . 04 µm , 0 . 75 ± 0 . 07 µm in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively , and these did not differ signi ﬁ cantly ( ANOVA , p = 0 . 24 ; Figure 6C ) . 3 . 1 . 4 Volume Mean volumes of SC IW cells were 669 . 58 ± 65 . 50 µm 3 , 671 . 96 ± 65 . 06 µm 3 , 383 . 25 ± 51 . 53 µm 3 in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively . Mean volumes varied signi ﬁ cantly among ﬂ ow - type areas ( ANOVA , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the cells in high - and low - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly larger cellular volumes than the cells in non - ﬂ ow areas ( both p ≤ 0 . 01 ; Figure 6D ) . 3 . 2 IW / JCT Connections 3 . 2 . 1 Total Cellular Connections Between SC IW Cells and JCT Cells / Matrix The mean total number of connections per IW cell between IW cells and JCT cells / matrix were 26 . 6 ± 3 . 8 , 45 . 0 ± 4 . 5 , and 59 . 1 ± 5 . 2 in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively . These varied signi ﬁ cantly among ﬂ ow - type areas ( ANOVA , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer total connections than the cells in low - ( p = 0 . 02 ) and non - ﬂ ow areas ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ; Figure 7A ) .

These varied signi ﬁ cantly among ﬂ ow - type areas ( ANOVA , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the cells in high - and low - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer IW cell - JCT matrix connections compared to the cells in non - ﬂ ow areas ( p = 0 . 01 and p ≤ 0 . 01 , respectively ; Figure 7A ) .

SC Connectivity Regulates Segmental Flow 3 . 2 . 1 . 2 IW Cell - JCT Cell Connections Mean IW cell - JCT cell connections per IW cell were 8 . 1 ± 2 . 2 , 29 . 3 ± 3 . 4 , and 26 . 0 ± 4 . 1 in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively ( Figure 7A ) . These varied signi ﬁ cantly among ﬂ ow - type areas ( ANOVA , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer IW cell - JCT cell connections compared to those in low - and non - ﬂ ow areas ( both p ≤ 0 . 01 ; Figure 7A ) . IW cell - JCT cell connections were analyzed by their types ( 2 – 7 ) based on how they connect to one another . The most common types of IW cell - JCT cell connections were types 5 , 4 , and then 2 . Mean number of IW - cell - JCT cell connections per IW cell differed signi ﬁ cantly among three ﬂ ow - types for type 2 ( ANOVA , p = 0 . 01 ) , type 3 ( p = 0 . 03 ) , type 4 ( p = 0 . 02 ) , type 5 ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) , and type 7 ( p ≤ 0 . 02 ) ( Figure 7B ) . Only type 6 connections did not differ signi ﬁ cantly among three ﬂ ow - type areas ( p = 0 . 74 ) . Generally , the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections than those in low - ﬂ ow , or non - ﬂ ow , or both . Speci ﬁ cally , for type 2 , the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections ( 1 . 2 ± 0 . 6 ) than the cells in non - ﬂ ow areas ( 4 . 5 ± 1 . 1 ; p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . For type 3 , the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections ( 0 . 1 ± 0 . 1 ) than those in low - ﬂ ow areas ( 0 . 7 ± 0 . 2 ; p = 0 . 02 ) . For type 4 , the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections ( 3 . 3 ± 1 . 1 ) than those in low - ﬂ ow areas ( 9 . 9 ± 2 . 2 ; p = 0 . 03 ) . For type 5 , the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections ( 2 . 8 ± 0 . 9 ) than those in low - ﬂ ow ( 13 . 5 ± 1 . 6 ; p ≤ 0 . 01 ) and non - ﬂ ow areas ( 10 . 1 ± 2 . 1 ; p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . For type 7 , the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections ( 0 . 3 ± 0 . 2 ) compared to those in low - ﬂ ow ( 1 . 8 ± 0 . 4 ; p ≤ 0 . 01 ) and non - ﬂ ow areas ( 1 . 4 ± 0 . 4 ; p = 0 . 03 ) ( Figure 7B ) . 3 . 2 . 2 Giant Vacuoles and IW Cell - JCT Cell Connections Beneath GVs The mean numbers of GVs per IW cell were 7 . 0 ± 1 . 2 , 4 . 4 ± 0 . 6 , and 4 . 2 ± 0 . 6 in high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow areas , respectively ( Table 1 ) . These means were not quite signi ﬁ cantly different ( p = 0 . 05 ) ; however , the range of number of GVs per IW cell was highest in high - ﬂ ow ( range : 1 – 15 ) , then low - ﬂ ow ( range : 1 – 11 ) , and then smallest in non - ﬂ ow ( range : 1 – 9 ) . The percentages of GVs with I - pores appeared larger in the cells in high - ( 19 . 0 % ) and low - ﬂ ow ( 21 . 2 % ) areas compared to non - ﬂ ow ( 9 . 5 % ) ( Table 1 ) . For each GV of each IW cell , we determined the number of connections that were beneath the GVs in each SBF - SEM image in which the GVs appeared . We found that the mean number of connections beneath a GV differed signi ﬁ cantly among ﬂ ow - type areas ( p < 0 . 01 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the GVs in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections beneath them ( 2 . 4 ± 0 . 3 ; n = 105 ) compared to GVs in low - ﬂ ow ( 4 . 6 ± 0 . 6 ; n = 66 ; p ≤ 0 . 01 ) and non - ﬂ ow areas ( 5 . 2 ± 0 . 7 ; n = 63 ; p ≤ 0 . 01 ; Figures 8A , B ) . We also calculated the percentage of connections under GVs for each IW cell . We found that a mean of 39 . 1 ± 2 . 7 % of connections was under GVs for our 45 cells , compared to 60 . 9 % of connections in areas without GVs . This did not differ among ﬂ ow - type areas ( 44 . 6 ± 5 . 4 % in high - ﬂ ow , 41 . 2 ± 5 . 4 % in low - ﬂ ow , and 31 . 6 ± 3 . 7 % in non - ﬂ ow areas ) ( p = 0 . 12 ) . We also determined the percentages of each GV type , based on previous studies ( Grierson and Lee , 1978 ; Koudouna et al . , 2019 ; Swain et al . , 2021 ) : Type I : no basal opening or I - pore ; Type II : basal opening , no I - pore ; Type III : I - pore , no basal opening ; and Type IV : both basal opening and I - pore . Of the 234 GVs we found in all 45 cells , 67 ( 28 . 6 % ) , 127 ( 54 . 3 % ) , 7 ( 3 . 0 % ) , 33 ( 14 . 1 % ) were Types I , II , III , and IV GVs , respectively . Due to the relatively small numbers of types III and IV across different ﬂ ow areas , the subsequent analysis was conducted using all GVs combined . To investigate the relationship between cellular connections and GV types , we determined the median ratio of total connections beneath GVs to GV volume for the four types of GVs . The medians were 0 . 32 ( IQR : 0 . 01 – 0 . 63 ) , 0 . 08 ( IQR : 0 . 01 – 0 . 31 ) , 0 . 06 ( IQR : 0 . 05 – 0 . 75 ) , and 0 . 04 ( IQR : 0 . 01 – 0 . 14 ) in GV types I , II , III , and IV , respectively . We found that these ratios varied signi ﬁ cantly among GV types ( Kruskal - Wallis test , H = 7 . 84 , p < 0 . 05 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , the median ratios of total connections per unit GV volume in Type IV ( with I - pore and basal opening ) and Type II ( basal opening , no I - pore ) GVs were signi ﬁ cantly decreased compared to Type I ( no basal opening or I - pore ) ( both p = 0 . 02 ; Figure 8C ) . 3 . 3 IW / IW Overlap and B - Pores Mean OL was 0 . 24 ± 0 . 02 µm for all 45 reconstructed cells . Mean OL was 0 . 18 ± 0 . 03 µm , 0 . 29 ± 0 . 05 µm , and 0 . 23 ± 0 . 03 µm for high - , low - , and non - ﬂ ow cells , respectively ( Figure 9A ) . OL did FIGURE 5 | 3D reconstructions of cells from three ﬂ ow - type areas .

SC Connectivity Regulates Segmental Flow not differ signi ﬁ cantly between ﬂ ow - type areas ( p = 0 . 12 ) . There were 12 B - pores in total , three in high - ﬂ ow , two in low - ﬂ ow , and seven in non - ﬂ ow . Nine of our 45 IW cells had at least one B - pore . In non - ﬂ ow , 1 cell had 2 B - pores and 1 cell had 3 B - pores with adjacent cells . OL near B - pores ( measured on sections before and after a B - pore was present ) was always 0 µm for all 12 B - pores , and this was signi ﬁ cantly less than the mean OL for these nine cells ( 0 . 21 ± 0 . 06 µm , p ≤ 0 . 01 ; Figure 9B ) . 4 DISCUSSION In this study , we used SBF - SEM and 3D reconstruction to investigate the cellular connectivity between IW endothelial cells and their underlying JCT matrix / cells in different ﬂ ow - type areas in normal human eyes perfusion - ﬁ xed at 15 mmHg to understand how changes in cellular connections may play a role in GV and pore formation and regulation of segmental out ﬂ ow . Our main ﬁ ndings were the following : 1 ) mean cellular connections were signi ﬁ cantly fewer in the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas compared to those in low - and non - ﬂ ow areas ; 2 ) GVs of the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas also had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections beneath them compared to the GVs of the cells in low - and non - ﬂ ow areas ; 3 ) Type IV GVs had a signi ﬁ cantly decreased median number of total connections beneath them per unit volume , compared to Type I GVs ; and 4 ) OL between adjacent IW cells was always 0 µm near B - pores . This was the ﬁ rst study to quantify the total number of cellular connections on individual SC IW endothelial cells in different ﬂ ow - type areas . We found that the mean total number of connections on IW cells in high - ﬂ ow areas was signi ﬁ cantly decreased compared to those in low - and non - ﬂ ow areas FIGURE 6 | Innerwallcelldimensions .

IW cell - JCT matrix connections and IW cell - JCT cell connections were also signi ﬁ cantly decreased in the cells in high - ﬂ ow compared to those in low - and / or non - ﬂ ow areas ( Figure 7A ) . These results suggest that the physical separation between the JCT and IW observed in ex vivo perfused eyes may be due to decreased cellular connectivity between the IW cells and JCT cells / matrix . Previous studies have shown that the distribution of ﬂ ow areas around the circumference of the eye can change under certain conditions . For example , one study used non - diseased human ex - vivo donor eyes perfused with ﬂ uorescent tracers labeling on day 1 and day 8 of continuous perfusion at 1x or 2x physiologic pressure ( Vranka et al . , 2020 ) . This study found that over time the amount of these ﬂ ow areas and their positions could change overtime at 2x physiologic pressure . Previous studies with rho - kinase inhibitors , including Y27632 and netarsudil , found that the amount of high - ﬂ ow ( or active ﬂ ow ) areas around the eye is increased compared to untreated control eyes ( Yang et al . , 2013 ; Ren et al . , 2016 ) . Based on these observations , low - ﬂ ow areas do not necessarily remain low - ﬂ ow areas and could become high - ﬂ ow areas when induced pharmacologically . Our current study ’ s ﬁ ndings of fewer connections between IW and JCT in high - ﬂ ow areas suggest that modulating the cellular connectivity between these two tissues could be a method to increase the amount of EFA around the circumference of the eye . To better understand GV formation and its relationship to the cellular connections between the IW cells and underlying JCT cells / matrix , we determined the mean number of connections beneath GVs and found that GVs in cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections compared to GVs FIGURE 7 | Mean number of cellular connections between IW cells and JCT cells / matrix . ( A ) : Total connections were signi ﬁ cantly decreased in cells in high - ﬂ ow areas , compared to those in low - and non - ﬂ ow areas . When analyzed by IW cell to JCT matrix ( cell - matrix connections ) , IW cells in high - ﬂ ow and low - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections than those in non - ﬂ ow areas . When analyzed by IW cell to JCT cells ( cell - cell connections ) , IW cells in high - ﬂ ow areas had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections than those in low - and non - ﬂ ow areas . ( B ) : When IW cell - JCT cell connections were analyzed by type , the most common types were type 5 , 4 , and then 2 .

SC Connectivity Regulates Segmental Flow in cells of low - and non - ﬂ ow areas ( Figure 8B ) . We also found that the mean percentage of connections under GVs for all IW cells was 39 . 1 % overall compared to 60 . 9 % in areas of the IW cells without GVs . These ﬁ ndings suggest that the IW cells may need to detach from the underlying JCT cells / matrix in areas where GVs will form . Additionally , we determined the ratio of the total number of connections beneath the GVs per unit volume . We used this ratio to account for differences in volumes between the four types of GVs . We found that the ratio of GVs was signi ﬁ cantly decreased in Type IV GVs compared to Type I GVs ( Figure 8C ) . Our previous study found that cells perfusion - ﬁ xed at 15 mmHg had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections to underlying JCT cells / matrix and signi ﬁ cantly larger GVs with I - pores than cells ﬁ xed at 0 mmHg , which did not have I - pores ( Lai et al . , 2019 ) . Another of our previous studies demonstrated that GVs with I - pores have signi ﬁ cantly larger volumes and span signi ﬁ cantly more sections than those without I - pores and that high - ﬂ ow areas have signi ﬁ cantly more Type IV GVs compared to non - ﬂ ow areas ( Swain et al . , 2021 ) . In the context of our previous studies , our current ﬁ ndings may suggest that the number of connections between IW cells and underlying JCT cells / matrix may in ﬂ uence GV size . These ﬁ ndings together support the hypothesis that modulating cellular connectivity may promote the formation of larger Type IV GVs in the IW endothelium and increase AH out ﬂ ow . While we did not ﬁ nd a difference in the amount of OL between different ﬂ ow - type regions , we did ﬁ nd that the OL was always 0 µm on the sections before and after a B - pore appeared . The similarity in OL between ﬂ ow - type areas was not surprising given that a relatively similar number of B - pores were found in each population of cells from each ﬂ ow - type area . The ﬁ nding that OL was always 0 µm before and after a B - pore is consistent with previous studies and the hypothesis that tight junctions simplify and that OL needs to decrease in order to form B - pores in the IW endothelium ( Ye et al . , 1997 ; Lai et al . , 2019 ) . One previous study in mouse eyes found that targeting tight junctional proteins with small interfering RNA resulted in signi ﬁ cantly increased paracellular permeability ( Tam et al . , 2017 ) . Our ﬁ ndings support the hypothesis that potentially targeting tight junctions to reduce OL may be a strategy for pharmaceutical intervention to promote B - pore formation and increase AH out ﬂ ow . We also found that the IW cell dimensions varied among ﬂ ow - type areas . In high - ﬂ ow areas , there is lower resistance to AH out ﬂ ow and a larger pressure difference between anterior chamber IOP and the venous system ; thus , more AH ﬂ ow is directed through these areas . In response to this AH ﬂ ow and pressure gradient , IW endothelial cells deform and change shape by utilizing a reservoir of excess membrane that is stored in folds , or vesicles , in order to maintain total membrane surface area ( Raucher and Sheetz , 1992 ; Lee and Schmid - Schönbein , 1995 ; Overby et al . , 2009 ; Pedrigi et al . , 2011 ) . Our IW cells from non - ﬂ ow areas were signi ﬁ cantly shorter and narrower in nuclear and non - nuclear areas compared to IW cells in low - ﬂ ow areas . IW cells from non - ﬂ ow areas also had smaller volumes compared to IW cells in low - and high - ﬂ ow areas . These differences may be related to differences in the amount of AH ﬂ ow across these cells compared to those in high - ﬂ ow areas . However , with our method , there were various factors that could have in ﬂ uenced the IW cellular dimensions that we were not able to measure , including cytoskeletal dynamics , extracellular matrix stiffness , cell tension , stage of the cell cycle for the IW cells , and ﬂ uid shear stress in the lumen of SC , so further investigation is warranted into the factors that impact cellular dimensions . Also , the selected IW endothelial cells in this study were limited to the cells that had their cell bodies completely within the frame of our images and image stacks ; therefore , our sample is not fully random . A larger study with more cell and eyes would be needed to con ﬁ rm this result . SBF - SEM provided a detailed method to investigate morphological characteristics of individual IW endothelial cells ; however , there were some limitations in our study . SBF - SEM is a static imaging modality ; therefore , we cannot determine the life cycle of the connections between IW cells and JCT cells / matrix . For example , a projection from an IW cell that is identi ﬁ ed as an IW cell - JCT matrix connection may have been connected to a JCT cell process immediately before the eye was ﬁ xed . Similarly , for GVs without I - pores , we cannot determine whether a GV simply did not form an I - pore or had formed an I - pore that closed immediately FIGURE 9 | Mean overlap length between adjacent inner wall cells . ( A ) : Mean overlap length ( OL ) was 0 . 236 ± 0 . 022 µm ( n = 45 cells ) , and this was not different between ﬂ ow - type areas . ( B ) : OL was measured on the sections before and after a B - pore was observed for 12 B - pores . OL was always 0 μ m , which was signi ﬁ cantly less ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) than the mean OL for the nine inner wall ( IW ) cells on which the B - pores were found . * * p ≤ 0 . 01 . Error bars : SEM .

Further studies utilizing live cell imaging may further elucidate the dynamic process of I - pore formation . Also , we cannot distinguish the different types of integrins that mediate the different types of IW cell - JCT matrix / cell connections with our SBF - SEM method . Finally , due to the labor - intensive nature of SBF - SEM and manual segmentation of cells , we were only able to capture a relatively small population of 45 cells . In summary , despite SBF - SEM and manual segmentation being labor - intensive , a major advantage of our technique was that the high - resolution , serial imaging allowed us to investigate the connectivity of the IW with the JCT in 3D and provided volumetric data . In this study , we demonstrated that IW cell - JCT cell / matrix connectivity was signi ﬁ cantly decreased in the cells in high - ﬂ ow areas . The GVs in high - ﬂ ow areas also had signi ﬁ cantly fewer connections beneath them compared to low - and non - ﬂ ow areas . These results suggest that modulating the IW - JCT and IW - IW connectivity may potentially affect the amount of EFA around the circumference of the eye , and thereby modulate aqueous out ﬂ ow .
