Thinking and Guessing : Bayesian and Empirical Models of How Humans Search Marta Kryven University of Waterloo , Waterloo , Ontario , Canada Tomer Ullman Massachusetts Institute of Technology William Cowan University of Waterloo , Waterloo , Ontario , Canada Josh Tenenbaum Massachusetts Institute of Technology Abstract : Searching natural environments , as for example , when foraging or looking for a landmark , combines reasoning under uncertainty , planning and visual search . Existing paradigms for studying search in humans focus on step - by - step infor - mation sampling , without examining advance planning . We propose and evaluate a Bayesian model of how people search in a naturalistic maze - solving task . The model encodes environment exploration as a sequential process of acquiring information modelled by a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process ( POMDP ) , which maximises the information gained . We show that the search policy averaged across participants is optimal . Individual solutions , however , are highly variable and can be explained by two heuristics : thinking and guessing . Self - report and inference , a Gaussian Mixture Model over inverse POMDP , consistently assign most subjects to one style or the other . By analysing individual participantsâ€™ decision times we show that individuals solve partial POMDPs and plan their search a limited number of steps in advance . 2475
