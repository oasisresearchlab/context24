Comparison of dynamin assemblies by Fourier transforms , class averages and longitudinal sections from the 3D maps ( A ) Fourier transform patterns of a ∆ PRD Dyn GMPPCP tube , a K44A Dyn GTP tube and the K44A Dyn GTP 3D map reveal that the strong layer line associated with the pitch ( dotted lines ) is further from the meridian in the K44A Dyn GTP correlating with a 2 - start helix . The Bessel function for the first strong layer line ( arrow ) of K44A Dyn GTP polymer is 1 . 91 compared to 0 . 96 for the ∆ PRD Dyn GMPPCP polymer , indicating a 2 - start helix versus a 1 - start helix .

Expression of K44A Dyn in Sf9 insect cells was performed as previously described ( Warnock et al . , 1995 ) . Briefly , high - titer baculovirus stock of K44A Dyn was used to infect Sf9 insect cells at a concentration of 1x10 6 per ml , MOI = 10 . Protein was expressed at 28˚C for 40 hours . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1 , 500 rpm and pellets resuspended in HCB50 * ( 50 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM MgCl 2 , plus * EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail , Roche ) . Human WT Dyn and K44A Dyn were purified as described previously ( Owen et al . , 1998 ) with some modification . Cells were lysed using a one shot system ( Constant Systems Ltd ) and soluble protein was collected by centrifugation at 50 , 000 rpm for 60 min at 4˚C . Briefly , WT Dyn and K44A Dyn cell lysate was added to Amphiphysin - 2 SH3 - conjugated Sepharose beads ( approximately one 600 ml Sf9 cell pellet per 0 . 5 ml GST - amphiphysin - 2 SH3 - conjugated Sepharose ) and the suspensions were incubated for 60 min at 4°C with gentle rocking to allow protein to bind to the beads . Unbound protein was collected and the beads were washed in 10 x bed volumes HCB50 * . Bound WT Dyn and K44A Dyn was eluted with high salt buffer ( 1 . 2 M NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 10 mM CaCl 2 , 20 mM PIPES , pH 6 . 5 ) and dialyzed into HCB150 * ( 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) before aliquots were snap frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at - 80˚C . Dynamin lipid tube formation Dynamin lipid tubes were generated as described previously ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ) . In brief , purified WT Dyn and K44A Dyn were spun at 13 , 000 rpm for 5 min to remove aggregates prior to incubation with lipid . Synthetic DOPS ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) at a concentration of 2 mg / ml in HCB100 ( 100 mM NaCl ) was extruded 11 - 15 times through a 1 - µ m polycarbonate membrane ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) to form unilamellar vesicles . Protein was incubated with liposomes for 1 12 hour at room temperature . Super - constricted tubes were generated by addition of 1 mM GTP ( Jena Biosciences ) to preformed K44A Dyn - lipid tubes for 30 min at room temperature . Incubating K44A Dyn , liposomes and GTP together for 1 hour at room temperature also generated identical K44A Dyn super - constricted tubes . WT Dyn super - constricted tubes were generated by addition of GTP to preformed protein - lipid tubes . Protein decorated lipid tubes were absorbed onto carbon - coated 400 mesh Cu / Rh grids ( Ted Pella , Inc . ) and stained with 1 % Uranyl Acetate for 30s . Samples were analyzed in a Tecnai 12 ( FEI ) at 120kV and images were captured using a 1 x 1 Gatan CCD camera . Hand determination To determine the hand of super - constricted K44A Dyn GTP tubes , visualized by negative stain , single tilts at - 10˚ , - 40˚ , and - 50˚ as well as complete tilt series from 60˚ to - 60˚ were collected on a Tecnai 12 ( FEI ) at 120kV using the Inspect3D software package ( FEI ) . TMV and ∆ PRD Dyn , both of which have been shown to form right - handed helices ( Finch , 1972 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 2001 ) , were used as references . The serrated edges of K44A Dyn GTP , TMV , ∆ PRD Dyn GMPPCP , and WT Dyn GTP are all on the top of the tubes ( which is the right side when looking down the tube ) , confirming they are all right - handed . Additional 3D reconstruction methods Long K44A Dyn GTP lipid tubes were boxed at a width of 250 pixels using Helixboxer and further boxed into 200 x 200 pixel segments using Boxer ( Ludtke et al . , 1999 ) based on the diameter of the tubes , cross - correlation was used to classify the segments into different groups ( Figure S1D ) . In total 11 groups were used with outer diameters ranging from 33 to 43 nm . Groups 35 and 36 ( 7525 segments ) were used for the final 3D reconstruction . Cross correlation data sets filtered ( using gfermi _ filter ) and raw dataset were used to create back projections . A helical cylinder model ( created in Spider MO 3 ) was used as an initial reference model . The final map merged to a rotation angle of 30 . 59˚ and rise of 17 . 19 Å . Multiple sets of initial helical parameters were tested including 1 - , 13 2 - and 3 - start and all converged to a 2 - start helix . The in - plane rotation limitation was 5˚ and out - of - plane tilt correction range was + 20 to - 20˚ . Projection distribution of the segments used in the final map is shown in Figure S1E . Comparing the computed Fourier transform of the ∆ PRD Dyn tubes ( 1 - start helix ) and K44A Dyn GTP tubes ( 2 - start helix ) show that the strong layer lines associated with helical pitch are further from the meridian , confirming that K44A Dyn has helical start greater than one ( Figure S2A ) . The Bessel order ( N ) of the first strong layer line , associated with the helical pitch , was calculated using the following formula 1 . 1 | N | + 0 . 9 = 2 Π Rr . Determination of helix lateral packing The lateral packing ( L ) of subunits along the helical path was determined as the helical arc length divided by the number of subunits per helical turn ( s ) : Lateral Packing = √ ( ( n Π d ) 2 + h 2 ) s n is the number of helical turns ( 1 ) , d is the diameter of the helix ( 37 . 6 nm for K44A Dyn GTP and 41 nm for ∆ PRD Dyn GMPPCP ) , and h is the helical pitch ( 10 . 1 nm and 9 . 9 nm , respectively ) . L ( K44A Dyn GTP ) was determined to be 119 . 77 nm and L ( ∆ PRD Dyn GMPPCP ) 129 . 1 nm . The number of subunits per turn is 11 . 77 for K44A Dyn GTP and 13 . 2 for ∆ PRD Dyn GMPPCP , resulting in a similar lateral packing of subunits along the helical path in ( 10 . 18 nm / subunit compared to 9 . 78 nm / subunit ) . The lateral packing of the WT Dyn helix is significantly greater , 12 . 7 nm ( L = 166 . 86 nm , d = 53 nm , h = 11 . 8 nm , and s = 13 . 12 ) . Generation of class averages for inner lumen measurements Class averages were calculated for dynamin lipid tubes incubated with or without GTP . Segments of dynamin tubes were boxed off , classified based on diameter , and averaged . Averages were calculated from 1759 images for WT Dyn , 842 for WT Dyn GTP and 7813 for K44A Dyn GTP . The inner luminal diameter was measured by bshow ( Heymann and Belnap , 2007 ) and 1D projections of the class averages were plotted using Kaleidagraph . The inner luminal diameter ( Figure 3B , line ) 14 was determined by measuring the distance between the lipid bilayer peaks ( Figure 3B , dots ) in the 1D projections and subtracting the lipid thickness of 4 nm . Sedimentation assay WT Dyn or K44A Dyn decorated DOPS tubes were incubated with 1 mM GTP from 0 - 30 min . Samples were centrifuged at 50 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4˚C . Supernatant was removed from the pellet fraction . Supernatant and pellet samples were run on a SDS - PAGE and stained with Coommassie Brilliant Blue for visualization . The amount of protein in the pellet fraction ( lipid - bound ) was determined using CS Photoshop . GG construct purification and dimerization The human dynamin 1 isoform sequence served as the basis for all constructs . WT GG and K44A GG constructs were purified and analyzed by size - exclusion chromatography as described previously using a Superdex 75 PC 3 . 2 column ( Chappie et al . , 2010 ) . GG constructs were diluted to a final concentration of 4 mg / ml in the presence or absence of guanine nucleotide analogs ( GDP , GTP or GMPPCP at 2 . 5 mM final concentration ) and GDP . AlF 4 - ( 2 . 5 mM GDP , 2 . 5 mM AlCl 3 , and 25 mM NaF ) . Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Colorimetric GTPase assay The ability of WT Dyn and K44A Dyn to hydrolyze GTP was assayed using a colorimetric assay with Malachite green that detects release of inorganic phosphate ( P i ) ( Leonard et al . , 2005 ) . Final protein concentration was 0 . 5 - 1 . 5 µ M . Protein solution ( in HCB150 ) was mixed 1 : 1 with GTP buffer ( 2 mM GTP , 2 mM MgCl 2 in HCB150 ) and incubated at 37°C for 0 - 60 minutes . 10 µl of each sample was added to a 96 - well plate ( in duplicates ) and quenched with 0 . 5 mM EDTA . 150 µl Malachite green solution ( 1 mM malachite green in 10 mM ammonium molybdate in 1 N HCl ) was added to each well and the samples were analyzed in a plate reader at OD 650 . The amount of P i released was calculated 15 using a P i reference standard . Kaleidagraph was used to plot P i release over time for WT Dyn and K44A Dyn . SUPPLEMENTAL REFERENCES Chappie , J .
