The activity of BRCA2 needs to be tuned precisely to be active when and where it is 21 needed . Here , we quantified the spatio - temporal dynamics of BRCA2 in living cells using 22 aberration - corrected multifocal microscopy ( acMFM ) . Using multicolor imaging to identify 23 DNA damage sites , we were able to quantify its dynamic motion patterns in the nucleus and 24 at DNA damage sites . While a large fraction of BRCA2 molecules localized near DNA damage 25 sites appear immobile , an additional fraction of molecules exhibits subdiffusive motion , 26 providing a potential mechanism to retain an increased number of molecules at DNA lesions . 27 Super - resolution microscopy revealed inhomogeneous localization of BRCA2 relative to 28 other DNA repair factors at sites of DNA damage . This suggests the presence of multiple 29 nanoscale compartments in the chromatin surrounding the DNA lesion , which could play an 30 important role in the contribution of BRCA2 to the regulation of the repair process . 31 INTRODUCTION 32 The activity of proteins needs to be controlled spatially and temporally . This is especially true 33 for proteins that maintain the integrity of the genome through DNA repair reactions . These 34 proteins must act at the right time and place to repair DNA damage . They need to cooperate 35 or compete with many other proteins at the same genomic location , such as proteins 36 involved in replication and transcription . The critical parameters that define the activity of 37 these proteins in cells are their concentration and their diffusion rate . Simultaneously , both 38 transient , non - specific and specific interactions determine their spatial organization . These 39 specific and non - specific interactions can be with other proteins but also with other 40 biomolecules such as DNA and RNA . 41 BRCA2 is an essential DNA repair protein that is present in a low concentration in the cell 42 nucleus . It is found in a complex with several other DNA repair proteins , such as PALB2 and 43 RAD51 , which are all required at sites of DNA damage lesions repaired by homologous 44 recombination ( 1 ) . The central function of BRCA2 is to exchange the single - strand DNA 45 binding protein complex RPA with RAD51 on the resected DNA ends of DNA double - strand 46 breaks ( DSB ) . Additionally , the resolution of stalled replication forks and of interstrand - 47 crosslinks by homologous recombination requires localized activity of BRCA2 at damage 48 sites ( 2 , 3 ) . As an important tumor suppressor , BRCA2 is an extensively studied protein , 49 where BRCA2 mutations are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer ( 4 ) . 50 However , the biophysical properties of BRCA2 that drive its function in cells are not fully 51 understood . Here , our objective is to define the dynamic behavior of BRCA2 around DNA 52 lesions to understand the critical parameters that are required for BRCA2 to act properly . 53 DNA - associated proteins can exhibit different modes of diffusion that contribute to their 54 different functions ( 5 , 6 ) . For example , recently it has been reported that the transcriptional 55 regulator CTCF maintains transient binding zones within the cell nucleus , which could be a 56 mechanism to improve its target search efficiency in the nuclear volume ( 7 ) . Although many 57 nuclear proteins , such as transcription factors , are involved in direct and specific interactions 58 with DNA ( sequence motifs , specific structures ) , it appears that BRCA2 does not depend on 59 this type of interaction for its immobilization at damage sites , but rather on ( transient ) 60 protein - protein interactions ( 8 ) . The immobilization and accumulation of BRCA2 is essential 61 for its function , but what interactions are relevant for this behavior and how this correlates 62 with its function is largely unknown . Several reports indicate a crucial interaction between 63 BRCA2 and PALB2 , and indeed BRCA2 accumulation at damage sites depends on the 64 interaction with PALB2 ( 9 ) , whereas localization of PALB2 itself is influenced by BRCA1 ( 10 ) 65 and the ubiquitin ligase RNF168 ( 11 ) . Recent data suggests that PALB2 chromatin interaction 66 depends on chromatin associated proteins ( 12 , 13 ) , hence those chromatin interactions could 67 also contribute to the diffusive patterns that have been observed for its binding partner 68 BRCA2 ( 8 , 14 ) . 69 BRCA2 accumulates at DNA damage into so - called foci , like several other homologous 70 recombination repair proteins . It is not yet fully understood how redistribution occurs and 71 how BRCA2 proteins organize themselves at damage sites . In this study , we applied 3D 72 single - molecule multiplane imaging to define the quantitative behavior of endogenous 73 BRCA2 at fluorescently marked DNA damage sites . This revealed that at DNA damage sites , 74 immobilization of BRCA2 increases , but also that those molecules that diffuse near DNA 75 lesions do so with increased confined mobility . Quantification of the number of BRCA2 76 molecules in the nucleus and at damage sites indicated that only tens of BRCA2 molecules 77 are present per focus , while super - resolution microscopy confirmed the localization of 78 BRCA2 in nanoscale clusters within foci . 79 80 MATERIAL AND METHODS 81 Cell culture 82 Mouse ES cells were maintained on 0 . 1 % gelatin ( Sigma ) coated plates in mouse ES cell 83 medium ( DMEM , 40 % BRL - conditioned medium , 10 % FCS ( Capricorn Scientific ) , 84 supplemented with pen - strep , non - essential amino acids ( Lonza ) and leukaemia inhibitory 85 factor ( 1000 U / ml ) and 0 . 1 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) . For the ac - MFM experiments cells were 86 maintained for several passages prior to the experiments in DMEM Knockout medium 87 ( Thermofisher ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Sigma , F2442 ) , pen - strep , LIF , NEAA and 0 . 1 88 mM β - mercaptoethanol . mES cells expressing BRCA2 - HaloTag previously generated and 89 described in ( 1 ) . Mouse ES cells expressing BRCA2 - EGFP were previously generated and 90 described in ( 2 ) . 91 DNA constructs 92 The EGFP - tr53BP1 construct was assembled using Gibson Assembly with a fragment of 93 human 53BP1 ( amino acids 1221 - 1709 , Addgene # 69531 ) ( 4 ) that was cloned in a EGFP 94 Piggybac vector ( 3 ) . 95 Generation of cell lines 96 The EGFP - 53BP1trunc Piggybac vector was transfected in BRCA2 - HaloTag cells together with 97 the CMV - Hypbase Piggybac transpose plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the 98 manufacturer’s protocol . Cells were selected with puromycin for 1 week after which the 99 selected population was used for the experiments . 100 Sample preparation of live cell imaging 101 Between 20 , 000 and 40 , 000 cells were seeded the day before the imaging experiment on 8 - 102 well ibidi dishes coated with 25 μg / ml laminin ( Roche , 11243217001 ) . When indicated , cells 103 were treated with 1 μg / ml mitomycin C ( Sigma , M0503 ) . For HaloTag labeling , the medium 104 was replaced and , subsequently , the cells were labeled with 50 nM JF549 - HaloTag dye , 105 unless a different concentration is indicated , followed by washing with PBS and replacement 106 with fresh medium . Imaging was done in FluoroBrite DMEM medium ( ThermoFisher , 107 A1896701 ) complemented with 10 % FCS , pen - strep , LIF , NEAA , 0 . 1 mM β - mercapto - ethanol . 108 For FRAP experiments cells were labelled with 250nM of JF549 - HaloTag ligand and cells were 109 labelled and washed as described above . For 2D tracking experiments in wild - type and 110 53bp1 knockout cells , cells were labeled with 0 . 5 nM JFX549 for 10 minutes . 111 Sample preparation for immunofluorescence 112 The cells were grown in 8 - well glass bottom dishes ( Ibidi ) or 24 mm round coverslips ( # 1 . 5H , 113 Marienfeld , 0117640 ) , coated with laminin as described above . For fixation cells were washed 114 with PBS once and fixed with 4 % PFA ( Thermo - Fisher ) in PBS for 10 minutes . Cells were 115 washed with PBS with 0 . 1 % triton for 3 times followed by two 10 - minute washing steps . Cells 116 were blocked with 3 % BSA in PBS for 20 minutes followed by incubation of the primary 117 antibodies in blocking buffer . After washing with PBS with 0 . 1 % Triton , cells were incubated 118 with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature . 119 For immunostaining of 53BP1 a rabbit polyclonal antibody was used ( 1 : 1000 , Novus 120 biologicals , NB100 - 304 ) together with anti - rabbit F ( ab′ ) 2 fragment conjugated with CF568 121 ( 1 : 1000 , Sigma , SAB4600310 ) . 122 For dSTORM imaging of HaloTag protein fusions , cells were incubated with 500 nM AF647 - 123 HaloTag ligand ( kind gift from Luke Lavis ) together with the primary antibodies in blocking 124 buffer for 2 hours at room temperature . 125 For STED imaging , mES cells expressing BRCA2 - EGFP ( 2 ) were treated with Mitomycin C ( 1 126 μg / ml ) for 2 hours . Subsequently , the cells were fixed 2 hours later with 4 % PFA . Cells were 127 immunostained as described above using anti - GFP nanobody conjugated with STAR635P 128 ( 1 : 500 , FluoTag X4 , 0304 - Ab635P , NanoTag ) . 53BP1 was visualized with anti - 53BP1 antibody 129 ( 1 : 2000 , Novus Biologicals , NB100 - 304 ) and secondary anti - rabbit Alexa594 ( 1 : 2000 , 130 ThermoFisher ) . Samples were mounted in ProLong Gold mounting medium on object 131 glasses . 132 Microscope setup and image acquisition 133 Ac - MFM setup The ac - MFM system was as described by Abrahamson et al ( 5 ) . In summary , 134 specimens were imaged on a Nikon TiE epifluorescence microscope with a 100x 1 . 45NA Plan 135 Apo objective lens ( Nikon ) and illuminated by 3 - 6kW / cm 2 561 nm laser excitation . 136 Fluorescence was collected and passed through a custom multifocal grating and color 137 correction grating as described by Abrahamsson et al . Nine focal planes were imaged onto 138 two EMCCD detectors ( iXon DU897 , Andor ) with a frame rate up to 30 Hz . The focal position 139 of the microscope was maintained by active stabilization . 140 Every day , prior to the imaging experiments , a sample with mounted 100 nm Tetraspeck 141 beads ( ThermoFisher ) was used to correct for chromatic aberrations , to measure the z - slice 142 separation distance , to determine relative z - plane detection efficiency , and to align image 143 channels . A Tokai Hit microscope stage holder was used to maintain cells at 37C with 5 % 144 CO 2 . Movies of 2000 frames were recorded , where in every 50 th frame the GFP signal was also 145 recorded on the second camera detector . The sample was continuously illuminated with 146 561nm light and constant low 405 nm light for photoactivation of Halo - JF549 . 147 Confocal imaging and FRAP Experiments were conducted on a Zeiss Elyra PS1 system with a 148 Tokai Hit stage incubator calibrated at 37 ºC and 5 % CO 2 using a 63x objective ( NA 1 . 4 Plan 149 Apo ) . For both FRAP experiments ( Figure 1 ) and quantitative confocal experiments ( Figure 150 3 ) a GaAsP detector was used . FRAP experiments were acquired using a square ROI of 151 1 . 14x1 . 14 µm , which was scanned at a 0 . 2 s interval , with 20 frames before bleaching , 4 152 frames bleaching at full laser power , followed by 230 frames to record recovery . Cells that 153 moved too much during acquisition were excluded from the analysis . Mean intensity from 154 the bleach ROI was measured over time . The intensity traces were normalized by the mean 155 intensity of frame 10 - 20 before bleaching . The data in Figure 1A shows the average 156 normalized intensity trace of multiple experiments , whereas the shading represents the 157 standard error of the mean intensity . 158 dSTORM I maging was performed using a Zeiss Elyra PS1 system using a 100x 1 . 46NA Korr α 159 Plan Apochromat objective . 561 and 642 100mW diode lasers were used to excite the 160 fluorophores together with respectively a BP 570 – 650 + LP 750 or LP 655 excitation filter . 161 dSTORM imaging was performed using near - TIRF ( HiLo ) settings , while the images were 162 recorded on an Andor iXon DU 897 , 512x512 pixel EMCCD camera . 163 For drift correction and channel alignment 100 nm Tetraspeck beads ( ThermoFisher ) were 164 added to the sample . To perform dSTORM imaging , an imaging buffer was prepared 165 containing 40 mM MEA ( Sigma ) , 0 . 5 mg / ml glucose oxide ( Sigma ) , 40 μg / ml Catalase 166 ( Sigma ) and 10 % w / v glucose in Tris pH 8 . 0 . dSTORM images were acquired sequentially , 167 starting with Alexa 647 staining followed by CF568 imaging . At least 10 , 000 images were 168 acquired at an interval of 33ms per frame . 169 The raw data was analysed by ZEN software . The molecules were localized , and a drift 170 correction was applied using image correlation in the two images separately . Localizations 171 that were present within 20 nm of each other in the 5 subsequent frames were grouped . 172 Subsequently , the two images were combined , and the channels were aligned laterally using 173 100 nm Tetraspeck beads that are deposited into the sample . 174 For blinking correction of the plots in Figure S8 we made use the pairwise distance 175 distribution correction algorithm ( DCC ) ( 6 ) . ROIs with ungrouped localizations were loaded 176 into Matlab and processed with the DCC script taking into account the photon counts as 177 obtained from the ZEN software . 178 STED The samples were imaged on a Leica SP8 tauSTED . Star635 signal was excited with a 179 white - light laser tuned at 632 nm and 775 nm depletion laser with a 2D STED depletion 180 pattern , whereas Alexa594 was imaged with the same depletion laser , but excited with the 181 white light laser tuned at 561 nm . STED images were deconvolved using Huygens software 182 ( SVI ) . 183 Image analysis for ac - MFM 184 Raw images from the ac - MFM microscope were converted to 3D stacks and corrected for 185 chromatic aberrations in MATLAB ( https : / / github . com / aicjanelia / MFM ) and processed using 186 background subtraction and Richardson - Lucy deconvolution ( 7px rolling ball , 5 iterations , 187 respectively ) . Subsequently , molecules were localized and tracked in 3D using the TrackMate 188 plugin ( 7 ) in ImageJ after pre - processing using and Gaussian blur denoising ( 0 . 7px radius ) . 189 The molecules were linked at a maximum frame - to - frame distance of 500 nm . 190 EGFP - tr53bp1 movies , that were used to define the DNA damages sites , were processed in 191 Matlab , where frames were identified that contained EGFP signal , the signal in intermediate 192 frames was interpolated linearly based on the image frame before and after . The foci signal 193 was identified using Laplacian of Gaussian edge detection and a binary mask was created . 194 Next , for every point of the tracks it was determined whether it was in or outside the mask . 195 To compare the results to a random situation , data sets were generated by randomly 196 redistributing the identified 3D objects at the first frame of the movie , along the x - y axes in 197 the image plane within the convex hull surrounding the centre of mass of all foci . The 198 MATLAB routines used for the analysis can be found in 199 https : / / github . com / maartenpaul / MFManalysis _ Matlab / ( based on original code repositories : 200 https : / / github . com / aicjanelia / MFM and https : / / gitlab . com / aicjanelia / visitor - maarten - paul ) . 201 Subsequently a script in R was used for processing of the tracks and plotting of the data 202 ( https : / / github . com / maartenpaul / MSDanalysis _ MFM ) . Python code to segment the tracks 203 into different mobile states using deep learning and to estimate the mean square 204 displacement and moment scaling spectrum of the individual tracklets ( 8 ) was incorporated 205 into Rstudio using the reticulate package ( 9 ) . 206 For further analysis , track ( let ) s presenting at least one frame of their lifetime inside the mask 207 were considered associated with the DNA damage sites . 208 The angle ( 𝜃𝜃 ) between two displacements within the track ( let ) s was calculated as described 209 in Hansen ( 2019 ) ( 7 ) . For the angle analysis displacements , immobile tracklets and x - y 210 displacements below 100 nm were excluded from the analysis . 211 For a single track ( let ) with 𝑟𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑡 ) = ( 𝑥𝑥 ( 𝑡𝑡 ) , 𝑦𝑦 ( 𝑡𝑡 ) ) its coordinates and 𝑇𝑇 ≥ 8 its total track length , 212 the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) , at different time lags 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 , was computed as follow : 213 214 MSD ( 𝛿𝛿𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 ) = 1 𝑇𝑇−𝛿𝛿 ∑ | 𝑟𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 ) − 𝑟𝑟 ( 𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿 ) | 2 𝑇𝑇−𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 = 1 ( 1 ) 215 The apparent diffusion constant 𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 and anomalous exponent 𝛼𝛼 were estimated by fitting a 216 linear regression on the logarithm form of the MSD power - law equation ( 10 ) ( using the first 217 4 MSD fitting points ) : 218 MSD ( 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 ) ∼ 2 𝑛𝑛𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 𝛼𝛼 ( 2 ) 219 where 𝑛𝑛 is the number of dimensions . 220 The radius of confinement 𝑅𝑅 𝑐𝑐 = 𝑅𝑅 ∞ � ( 𝑛𝑛 + 2 ) 2 ⁄ was measured after estimating the plateau 𝑅𝑅 ∞ 221 of the MSD curve ( 11 ) . The latter was estimated by fitting the following equation , using the 222 first 20 MSD fitting points and the “curve _ fit” function from the Python SciPy library : 223 MSD ( 𝛥𝛥𝑡𝑡 ) ∼ 𝑅𝑅 ∞2 � 1 − 𝑒𝑒 −2𝑛𝑛𝐷𝐷 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝛥𝛥𝛥𝛥 𝑅𝑅 ∞2 ⁄ � + 4 𝜎𝜎 2 ( 3 ) 224 with 𝜎𝜎 2 the experimental noise level . 225 226 Image analysis dSTORM 227 For quantification of BRCA2 clusters , 53BP1 foci were identified by applying an Otsu 228 threshold on 53BP1 images and saved as ImageJ ROIs . The ROIs were imported in R and 229 BRCA2 localizations that are within the ROIs were clustered using the RSMLM package using 230 the ToMaTo clustering algorithm ( r = 50 , threshold = 0 . 1 ) ( 13 ) . To remove spare localizations 231 clusters with less than 5 localizations were filtered out . Shape features describing these 232 clusters were determined using the SMoLR package ( 14 ) . The size of clusters is defined as the 233 mean of the FWHM of the major and the minor axis of the localizations within the cluster . 234 The distance between the clusters is determined as the distance between the centre of mass 235 of the two clusters within the same segmented 53BP1 focus . 236 Quantification of cellular concentration of BRCA2 237 HaloTag - GST ( 61 kDa ) ( Promega , G4491 ) was labelled with JF646 for 4 hours at 4 ° C on ice 238 with 3x excess HaloTag ligand ( buffer : 1x PBS , 20 % glycerol , 1 mM DTT ) . Followed by removal 239 of the unreacted HaloTag ligand using a Zeba desalting column ( 7K MWCO , 0 . 5 ml , 240 ThermoFisher , 89882 ) . Using SDS - PAGE it was confirmed that the labelled protein was 241 recovered after labelling and elution from the column . The concentration of the labelled 242 protein was validated using Nanodrop and on SDS - Page using a BSA with known 243 concentration . Subsequently this labelled protein was used as reference to estimate the 244 amount of BRCA2 per cell . 245 The nuclei of live cells were segmented in 3D using a routine in TrackMate ( 12 ) , which uses 246 Stardist ( 15 ) for 2D segmentation of nuclei , followed by connecting the matching nucleus 247 segmentation in the 3D image stack . A 3D label image was exported and used in a custom - 248 made routine developed in CellProfiler ( 16 ) . The label image was used to generate 3D nuclei 249 objects and was used to determine the nuclear volume and integrated intensity of the 250 BRCA2 - halotag intensity . The BRCA2 foci were segmented using an adaptive threshold in 3D 251 and volume and intensity were measured . The CellProfiler pipeline and accompanying R 252 code for processing and plotting the data is available at 253 https : / / github . com / maartenpaul / Halo _ cell _ quant . 254 The integrated intensity ( a . u . ) was converted to concentration and number of molecules by 255 comparing the intensity to a titration curve of the labelled HaloTag - GST : : JF646 standard 256 protein . Using this titration curve the intensity per pixel can be converted to the local 257 concentration of HaloTag protein . Assuming that the segmented nuclei are much larger than 258 the confocal volume per pixel this conversion can be used to estimate the concentration of 259 BRCA2 in the nuclei . Subsequently , the concentration can be converted to number of 260 molecules per nucleus by dividing the volume and Avogadro’s number . 261 For in - gel analysis of in vivo labelled BRCA2 - HaloTag , HaloTag was labelled with JF646 - 262 HaloTag ligand in live cells grown on plates . Subsequently cells were trypsinized and the cell 263 concentration was determined . Cells were resuspended at 25 , 000 cell / µl and treated with 264 benzonase in buffer with protease inhibitors ( 2 mM MgCl2 , 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 10 % glycerol , 265 1 % triton X - 100 and 25 U / ml benzonase ) and subsequently lysed by adding 2x Laemmli 266 buffer without bromophenol blue , at equal volume . Cell lysates were run on 3 - 8 % SDS - Page 267 Tris - Acetate gel . The fluorescently labelled proteins were imaged in the gel using a Typhoon 268 gel imager ( Amersham ) . 269 270 RESULTS 271 Previous studies have shown , that BRCA2 appears more immobile after induction of DNA 272 damage ( 8 , 14 ) . However , those studies did not investigate the spatial distribution of 273 immobilized BRCA2 after induction of DNA damage . BRCA2 is involved in the repair of 274 different types of lesions that also involve RAD51 - mediated homology recognition and DNA 275 strand exchange . One type of lesion requiring BRCA2 for repair is the interstrand - crosslink , 276 which can be induced by chemical reagents such as mitomycin C . The formation of BRCA2 277 foci after mitomycin C treatment is correlated with the observation that BRCA2 becomes 278 more immobile and suggests that induction of DNA damage causes a redistribution of 279 BRCA2 to DNA damage sites ( 14 ) . In this study , we use a previously generated mouse 280 embryonic stem ( ES ) cell line , in which endogenous BRCA2 is homozygously tagged with a 281 HaloTag by knock - in mediated by CRISPR / Cas9 . This enables direct , real - time visualization 282 of individual BRCA2 molecules in living cells . Here , we used this cell line ( as described in Paul 283 et al . , 2021 ) to investigate the mobility of BRCA2 at damage sites by applying spot - FRAP at 284 BRCA2 - HaloTag mitomycin C - induced DNA repair foci . These experiments show a large 285 immobile fraction of BRCA2 at the damage sites , with a 44 % fluorescence recovery of the 286 prebleached signal during 50 seconds of data acquisition , corrected for the residual 287 fluorescence signal after photobleaching . ( Figure 1A ) . This large immobile fraction for 288 BRCA2 is not observed in the nucleoplasm outside the foci , although the low concentration 289 of BRCA2 in the cell nucleus makes these measurements challenging . Together , our FRAP 290 experiment suggests that upon induction of DNA damage , part of the BRCA2 molecules 291 remain associated to DNA damage sites . 292 3D single - molecule tracking reveals BRCA2 immobilization at individual DNA repair 293 foci 294 Although FRAP is a powerful technique for studying the dynamic exchange of proteins in 295 cells , it has limited possibilities to differentiate between different types of diffusive behavior 296 of proteins at the single - molecule level , which can be better investigated with single - 297 molecule tracking ( 15 ) . In this study , we applied 3D single - molecule tracking in the entire 298 nucleus using a multicolor aberration - corrected multifocus microscope ( acMFM ) ( 16 ) ( Figure 299 1B , Movie S1 ) . Single - plane single - molecule tracking is restricted by the imaging volume , 300 since molecules can move in and out of the focal plane . Although the axial excitation 301 thickness for HiLo illumination acquisition is in the range of 1 - 2 µm , the cell nucleus is about 302 5 µm thick . Furthermore , DNA repair foci , in which BRCA2 dynamics needs to be quantitated , 303 are distributed across the entire nuclear volume , and therefore it is not possible to capture all 304 foci in one focal plane , and hence some of the foci will be out of focus . Finally , both cell 305 nuclei and DNA repair foci are dynamic in their composition and spatial location within the 306 nucleus ( 17 , 18 ) ; therefore the regions from which data should be recorded are moving 307 during image acquisition . 308 Using an acMFM microscope , nine focal planes are projected ( approximately 400 nm 309 spacing ) on a single camera chip . This allows for rapid instantaneous 3D imaging at 9 planes . 310 To identify DNA damage , EGFP - tr53BP1 was introduced into cells as a marker of DNA breaks . 311 This construct expressing a fragment of the 53BP1 protein ( a . a . 1221 - 1709 ) is a useful marker 312 for DNA breaks and was previously validated to not interfere with the repair process ( 19 – 21 ) . 313 Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the proper localization of the tr53BP1 protein in 314 our cells , overlapping with the signal of endogenous 53BP1 . Upon treatment with the DNA 315 crosslinking agent mitomycin C , tr53BP1 foci can be observed that co - localize with BRCA2 316 accumulations ( Figure S1 ) . By applying 3D single - molecule tracking and simultaneously 317 following the foci distribution in cells , we directly correlate the diffusive behavior of BRCA2 318 with regions of DNA damage ( Figure 1C ) . This developed image analysis routine allows us to 319 identify whenever a single BRCA2 molecule is within a region of damage during image 320 acquisition . Subsequently , we tracked the localized molecules in 3D and compared their 2D 321 and 3D displacements inside and outside the mask ( Figure 1D ) . This comparison of 322 displacement distributions shows a distribution with shorter displacements inside the mask 323 compared to outside of the mask ( Figure 1E , F ) . To validate the observed differences in the 324 displacements between inside and outside the DNA repair foci , we also analyzed the data 325 after randomly redistributing the segmented foci objects along the x - and y - axes of the 326 image plane ( see Methods section for details ) . Compared to the original data , the 327 randomized data shows no difference in the distribution of displacements inside compared 328 to outside the foci ( Figure 1E , F bottom panels ) . Additionally , we quantified the number of 329 localizations in the mask and observed that 9 . 9 % of the localizations are within the mask 330 whereas the randomly defined mask contains 1 . 3 % of the localizations . This shows that there 331 is a 7 . 9 times enrichment of localizations in the data compared to the random mask , 332 confirming the observation that BRCA2 accumulates at foci containing 53BP1 ( Figure 1G ) . 333 Using the described approach , we investigated the motion patterns of BRCA2 specifically at 334 DNA damage . We define molecules to be inside of the focus if they reside at least one frame 335 ( 50 ms ) inside the 53BP1 defined focus volume . This definition allows for comparison of 336 tracked molecules that are inside or in close proximity of the foci , with tracks outside the 337 foci , without introducing edge effects caused by using a binary mask : immobile molecules 338 will have a higher chance of staying within the mask for a longer time and hence will be 339 identified more frequently if we would do the analysis where the entire track needs to be 340 inside the mask . Since we have previously observed that BRCA2 molecules can frequently 341 switch between different diffusive states , we applied a recently developed deep learning 342 approach method to our single - molecule tracking data to segment tracks into tracklets ( 22 ) . 343 With this method we could define three different diffusive states for BRCA2 : fast ( D app = 0 . 44 344 µm 2 / s ) , slow ( D app = 0 . 05 µm 2 / s ) and immobile ( D app = 0 . 01 µm 2 / s ) , comparable to previous 345 studies ( 8 , 14 , 22 ) . For each individual tracklet ( see Figure S2 for the distribution of track 346 lengths ) , we fitted the mean square displacement ( MSD ) to a power - law equation ( MSD ~ t α ) 347 permitting the extraction of the anomalous exponent α , a metric that gives an indication of 348 the diffusion mode of the track with 0 < α < 1 showing specifically subdiffusion , and 1 < α < 349 2 superdiffusion . All molecules exhibited an anomalous exponent α below 1 suggesting 350 subdiffusion . Furthermore , both immobile ( α = 0 . 34 ) and slow molecules ( α = 0 . 60 ) display 351 more subdiffusive motion compared to fast molecules ( α = 0 . 92 ) ( Figure 2A ) . When 352 comparing different MSD curves for each diffusive state , we observe a clear separation 353 between the states , indicating three distinct mobility patterns . This observation is confirmed 354 by the theoretical MSD curves plotted using the median values in Figure 2B . 355 Subsequently we compared the diffusion constant D app and the anomalous exponent α of 356 the tracklets in and outside the foci . The diffusion constant of the different fractions is not 357 affected ( Figure 2C ) . However , the measured anomalous exponent α is reduced for all 358 fractions within the focus . Quantification of the fraction of tracklets inside the mask shows a 359 clear enrichment in the amount of BRCA2 tracklets in the immobile state at the identified 360 DNA damage sites ( 42 to 60 % ) , while both the slow ( 32 to 22 % ) and fast fraction ( 26 to 19 % ) 361 did decrease ( Figure 2D ) . 362 Finally , we compared the results of cells treated with mitomycin C with untreated cells 363 ( Figure S3 ) . In untreated mouse ES cells , spontaneous foci can be observed and 364 immobilization of BRCA2 has also been observed under unchallenged conditions , although 365 to a lesser extent . We confirmed these observations in our current experiments , where in the 366 untreated cells we see that the immobile fraction inside ( 52 % versus 60 % ) is lower while the 367 immobile fraction outside the foci is comparable ( 38 % versus 39 % ) to the treated cells . The 368 median diffusion constant of the different fractions was not different compared to the cells 369 treated with mitomycin C . Similarly , to treated cells the value of α was reduced for diffusing 370 fractions inside the foci ( Figure 2 , S3 ) . Interestingly , also the fraction of BRCA2 molecules 371 that resides in 53BP1 foci is lower compared to treated cells ( 3 . 4 % versus 9 . 9 % ) , indicating 372 that at spontaneous foci less BRCA2 molecules accumulate . 373 Diffusive BRCA2 molecules exhibit enhanced subdiffusive motion at DNA repair foci 374 Our aim was to further investigate the mechanism by which BRCA2 accumulates at the 375 damage sites . Tracking analysis showed that at sites of DNA damage , next to an increased 376 immobile fraction , slow diffusing molecules exhibited subdiffusive diffusion ( alpha < 1 ) . An 377 alternative approach to study the subdiffusion of proteins in cells is to look at the angular 378 distribution , a sign of anisotropic motion of the tracked molecules . Molecules that exhibit 379 regular diffusion will move in a random direction independent of their previous position , but 380 when motion is confined , molecules are more likely to make a backward step than forward 381 with respect to the previous step ( 5 , 7 ) . To investigate only diffusive molecules , we excluded 382 tracklets that are assigned by our state segmentation method as immobile from the analysis . 383 In fact , after calculating the angles , mobile BRCA2 molecules appear to have an anisotropic 384 motion pattern , and this anisotropy is enhanced at the DNA repair foci ( Figure 2E ) . This is 385 the case for both slow and fast diffusing molecules , although the fastest diffusing molecules 386 show this behavior to a lesser extent ( Figure 2F ) . Subsequently we quantified the fold 387 increase in the backward angle ( 180 + / - 15 degrees ) versus the forward angle ( 0 + / - 15 388 degrees ) compared to the average displacement of the tracked molecule at that time ( Figure 389 2G ) . We can observe a peak between 80 and 150 nm of the average displacement , which 390 suggests that , especially molecules having shorter displacements , are , transiently , more 391 confined to a subregion of the focus . Then we quantified the distribution of displacements of 392 molecules that transition from inside to outside or vice - versa . We observe that for both 393 transitions the smaller displacements are observed compared to the random mask ( Figure 394 2H ) . However , the transitions in either direction appear similar for both the data set and the 395 random mask , suggesting that movement in and out of the focus is not restricted . 396 To evaluate whether the BRCA2 molecules inside the foci do display confined motion within 397 the repair focus , we fitted the mean - square - displacement data to a confined motion model 398 which estimates a radius of confinement R c . For all immobile tracklets localized inside or 399 outside the mask , we estimated the plateau of each averaged MSD line ( Figure S4 ) . The 400 results show an estimated R c of about 0 . 126 µm outside the foci and 0 . 144 µm inside the foci 401 ( versus 0 . 136 µm inside the randomly generated mask ) . We reproduced the same 402 measurements for the moving molecules ( slow and fast combined ) , although the motion is 403 less confined regarding the previously calculated α values , leading to a potential delayed 404 MSD plateau . We found a R c value of 1 . 57 µm outside and surprisingly a very large Rc value 405 of about 6 . 21 µm inside the foci ( versus 2 . 70 µm inside the random masks ) . Although the 406 curve fits well to the data , the lack of a clear plateau in the MSD curve suggests that , for the 407 slow and fast diffusing molecules , the molecules do not experience confinement correlating 408 with focus size . For comparison we also fitted the same MSD curves to an anomalous 409 diffusion model which displays a non - linear relation between displacement and time , but 410 without constraint or a boundary ( Figure S5 ) . This also resulted in a good fit of the data 411 suggesting that the motion of BRCA2 at repair foci can be explained by transient binding of 412 molecules within the damage site resulting in the observed anomalous diffusion patterns . 413 BRCA2 is localized in multiple clusters of several BRCA2 - molecules at DNA repair foci 414 To better understand the organization of BRCA2 in the foci , we have applied dSTORM 415 imaging of BRCA2 - Halo to visualize the spatial arrangement of BRCA2 under similar 416 experimental conditions in 53BP1 foci after mitomycin C treatment . Previous experiments in 417 human cells using anti - BRCA2 antibodies showed the presence of multiple BRCA2 clusters 418 per focus ( 23 ) . By using direct HaloTag labelling of BRCA2 - Halo with Alexa647 - HaloTag 419 ligand , we can now more accurately localize BRCA2 in foci by single - molecule localization 420 microscopy . We used 53BP1 foci to identify regions of interest to determine the localization 421 of BRCA2 within . Visual comparison of the localization of 53BP1 and BRCA2 in the foci 422 indicates that BRCA2 is frequently excluded from regions that are dense in 53BP1 signal 423 ( Figure 3A ) . Within the 53BP1 foci we quantified BRCA2 to localize in multiple small clusters 424 of about 50 nm in size ( Figure 3A - C ) . Furthermore , we quantified the distance between 425 BRCA2 clusters ( Figure 3D ) . This analysis shows that most BRCA2 clusters are most frequently 426 200 nm spaced apart with respect to their centre of mass . T o confirm that BRCA2 cluster 427 formation was present in cells in lateS / G2 , where BRCA2 is expected to contribute to 428 homology - directed repair , we applied dSTORM imaging in cells that were labeled shortly 429 with EdU prior to fixation ( Figure S6 ) . In addition to the differential location between BRCA2 430 and 53BP1 , we also identified that RPA is differentially localized in the repair foci with respect 431 to BRCA2 ( Figure S7 ) . 432 We validated that the inhomogeneous localization that we observed by dSTORM is unlikely 433 to be an artifact caused by repetitive photoblinking , which is known to cause apparent 434 clustering in dSTORM imaging . First we used an algorithm to correct for blinking artifacts 435 and reconstruct the true emitters in a few of the foci ( 24 ) . This showed that after blinking 436 correction the BRCA2 clusters are still visible ( Figure S8 ) . Furthermore , we also used 2D - STED 437 imaging of BRCA2 and 53BP1 to determine the super - resolution localization of BRCA2 . While 438 the lateral resolution of STED is lower , hence less details are visible it is not affected by 439 blinking artifacts like in dSTORM . With STED imaging we also observe that molecules are 440 differentially organized and that BRCA2 can form multiple clusters per 53BP1 focus ( Figure 441 S8 ) . 442 Subsequently , we wanted to estimate the concentration of BRCA2 in mouse ES cell nuclei to 443 correlate the amount of BRCA2 present at repair foci with the clusters that are present in the 444 foci . For this purpose , we imaged live BRCA2 - HaloTag cells by confocal microscopy , while 445 titrating known concentrations of JF646 - labeled GST - HaloTag protein in cell culture medium . 446 This allowed us to determine the correlation between voxel intensity and HaloTag protein 447 concentration in the images ( Figure 3E , Figure S9 ) . Although we did not estimate the actual 448 excitation confocal volume of a voxel , we were able to determine the local concentration of 449 BRCA2 - Halo per pixel . With the assumption that the nuclei and foci are larger than the 450 confocal volume , we can use the integrated intensity of the objects to estimate the local 451 concentration and total number of BRCA2 molecules in individual nuclei . This shows a 452 nuclear concentration of 10 nM or about 5 , 000 molecules per cell nucleus ( Figure 3F ) . 453 Additionally , we were able to segment individual BRCA2 foci to estimate the number of 454 BRCA2 molecules per focus . This analysis indicates that the local concentration of BRCA2 is 455 nearly 10 times higher within repair foci ( ~ 100 nM ) whereas the mean number of BRCA2 456 molecules per focus was estimated at approximately 25 ( Figure 3G ) . This increase in 457 concentration of BRCA2 molecules at the repair foci is comparable to increased number of 458 localizations within repair foci we observed with single - molecule tracking ( Figure 1G ) . The 459 concentration of BRCA2 we determined in cells is consistent with the quantification of the 460 amount of cellular BRCA2 - Halo protein labelled with JF646 and on SDS - PAGE , while using 461 the GST - HaloTag protein with defined concentration as reference ( Figure S9 ) . Quantification 462 of the total intensity of the protein bands normalized to the number of cells in the sample 463 loaded , reports the average number of BRCA2 molecules per nucleus . 464 DISCUSSION 465 In this study we have investigated the dynamic behavior of BRCA2 specifically at 53BP1 foci 466 induced by the DNA crosslinker mitomycin C . Instantaneous multiplane two - color imaging 467 allowed us to detect the BRCA2 molecules localized in DNA repair foci and study their 468 mobility . Previous single - molecule tracking studies of BRCA2 have shown an increase in the 469 immobile fraction of BRCA2 after DNA damage induction ( 8 , 14 ) . Here , we show that this 470 immobilization is caused by BRCA2 that is localized to DNA repair foci . We identified that 471 only about 10 % of the BRCA2 molecules that were tracked within the nucleus were 472 accumulated at the foci , which explains the subtle increase in the immobilization of BRCA2 473 measured throughout the nucleus , as we have previously observed . In depth - analysis of the 474 3D tracking data revealed that next to the increased immobilization , diffusing BRCA2 475 molecules inside the foci show increased anomalous diffusion . This anomalous diffusion is 476 most evident in slow moving BRCA2 molecules , with an increased confinement for molecules 477 moving between 80 and 150 nm in a 50 ms time interval . A similar pattern of anomalous 478 diffusion is observed for BRCA2 molecules outside the foci , but to a lesser extent ( Figure 2E - 479 G ) . Similar motion patterns have been observed for other nuclear proteins such as CTCF and 480 transcription factors ( Sox2 and Oct4 ) ( 6 , 7 , 27 ) , which contribute to the function of these 481 proteins , such as improved target search in chromatin . For BRCA2 complexes , this could be a 482 mechanism to efficiently probe the chromatin environment for the presence of DNA 483 damage . The difference in the chromatin environment ( e . g . , changes in specific histone 484 modifications ) present at DNA damage sites could enhance transient binding of BRCA2 485 complexes at the damaged chromatin . This will allow BRCA2 , even at its low concentration , 486 to dynamically associate with the damaged genomic region . This local difference in affinity 487 could serve as a mechanism to retain and concentrate BRCA2 molecules at DNA damage for 488 a longer period and could explain the motion patterns observed for BRCA2 . 489 A similar mechanism could operate within a focus . Our observation by single - molecule 490 localization microscopy ( Figure 3 ) of BRCA2 clusters within a focus suggests that the 491 chromatin environment within a focus is not homogeneous . The measured distance between 492 these intra - focus BRCA2 clusters ( Figure 3 ) is consistent with the possibility of displacement 493 of BRCA2 molecules between these clusters ( resulting in the class of BCRA2 molecules with 494 confined motion ) , while molecules with larger displacements would lose their association 495 with the clusters . It remains to be investigated what interactions drive these motion patterns , 496 but it should be considered that BRCA2 is present in complex with several other repair 497 proteins such as PALB2 and RAD51 . For example , loss of the PALB2 - BRCA2 interaction 498 prevents BRCA2 localization in foci ( 9 ) . On the contrary , the accumulation of BRCA2 does not 499 depend on its highly conserved DNA binding domain and the C - terminal domain ( 8 ) , which , 500 at least in vitro , interact with ( single - stranded ) DNA ( 28 ) . An explanation is that BRCA2 is 501 bound to chromatin surrounding the DNA damage mainly through its N - terminal interaction 502 with PALB2 , without the requirement of all functional domains required to promote all 503 BRCA2 functions . In this way , the accumulation of BRCA2 is uncoupled from its canonical 504 function of loading RAD51 onto RPA coated DNA . On the other hand , the transient 505 interactions will help BRCA2 to reside at a focus for longer , that might be required to give 506 BRCA2 sufficient time to exert its function of regulating RAD51 filament formation . 507 Mechanisms of accumulation of BRCA2 at DNA lesions 508 The dynamics of a larger number of different DNA repair proteins has been investigated in 509 living cells . It shows that while many of these proteins accumulate at sites of DNA damage , 510 they can do so through different mechanisms ( 29 ) . While RAD51 and RPA are stably bound 511 ( 17 , 30 ) , RAD54 , another protein in the same DNA repair pathway , shows a different dynamic 512 behaviour ( 17 ) . Interestingly , while RAD54 visually accumulates in foci , immobilization of the 513 protein is hardly observed , unless its ATP activity is affected ( 31 ) . In recent years , liquid - liquid 514 phase separation ( LLPS ) has been proposed as an additional mechanism to drive 515 compartmentalization of proteins in DNA repair foci , as well as in other nuclear and cellular 516 processes . 53BP1 is one of the DNA repair factors that forms accumulations with liquid - like 517 characteristics ( 25 , 26 ) . Furthermore , RAD52 , a RAD51 mediator in yeast , can form 518 condensates in vitro and in vivo ( 32 ) . Another study using single - molecule tracking showed 519 that RAD52 in budding yeast shows reduced and confined mobility in foci , while the RPA 520 subunit Rfa1 , shows clear immobilization ( 30 ) . To drive the formation of condensates 521 proteins need to be present at a high enough concentration , however BRCA2 is present at a 522 low concentration in the cell nucleus and within the foci only tens of BRCA2 molecules are 523 present ( Figure 3 ) . This suggests that BRCA2 by itself is not phase separated but is trapped 524 in DNA lesion - containing compartments where it undergoes transient immobilization 525 through interaction with other proteins or DNA in the foci . As the examples above show , 526 repair factors can accumulate through different mechanisms of which transient binding and 527 the formation of phase separated compartments are the most well - described mechanisms . 528 Differentiating between these different modes of accumulation is not straightforward and 529 many different parameters have been proposed to prove the formation of condensates 530 through liquid - liquid phase separation ( 33 ) . With the current data on BRCA2 mobility we are 531 not able to apply modelling of the different models as we lack accurate information on the 532 strength and reversibility of the binding of BRCA2 within the foci , nor do we have an 533 accurate estimation of the surface potential in a phase - separation model ( 34 ) . 534 Through different approaches of analysing our tracking data we do observe that the 535 diffusion rate of the diffusive fraction of BRCA2 is not affected inside the repair focus . If 536 BRCA2 would be accumulating through interactions driven by the presence of phase 537 separation , a change in the measured diffusion rate of the diffusing molecules due to 538 transient molecular interactions would be expected , as has been observed for RAD52 in 539 yeast . Simultaneously we observe an increase in subdiffusive motion in the repair foci , 540 however using the mean - square displacement curve of the diffusive molecules we are not 541 able to observe a clear plateau in the MSD curve and the fitted confinement radius does not 542 match the size of repair foci . This suggests that the mobility of BRCA2 is not restricted by the 543 boundary of the focus , but that transient binding contributes to the accumulation of BRCA2 . 544 Dynamic organization of BRCA2 at DNA repair foci 545 In line with our previous publication on the localization of BRCA2 using antibodies , BRCA2 - 546 HaloTag is localized in small clusters at DNA break sites in fixed cells . Quantification of the 547 amount of BRCA2 in cell nuclei and repair foci specifically shows that only tens of BRCA2 548 molecules are present in DNA repair foci ; therefore , individual clusters of BRCA2 within a 549 focus will contain only a few BRCA2 molecules ( Figure 3 ) . The emerging picture from several 550 studies that use super resolution microscopy to study the architecture of DNA repair foci is 551 that proteins organized in repair foci in specific patterns rather than a homogeneous mix of 552 different repair factors ( 35 – 37 ) . For example , by single - molecule localization microscopy , we 553 have observed that part of the RAD51 proteins that are present at repair foci do not localize 554 with BRCA2 ( 23 ) . It is interesting to consider that even for proteins that are suggested to 555 accumulate by LLPS , such as 53BP1 , there is still spatial inhomogeneity of the protein within 556 the focus , instead of a homogeneous distribution of protein . A challenge for future studies 557 will be to converge the observed mobility patterns of the different proteins with their 558 nanoscale localization at foci . An important aspect that still needs to be addressed is how 559 dynamic the overall organization of repair foci is over time . Future studies using super - 560 resolution microscopy in living cells using methods to enhance spatial and temporal 561 resolution , will hopefully allow to further delineate the significance of spatiotemporal 562 dynamics of DNA repair foci that protect the cells against genomic instability . 563 564 DATA AVAILABILITY 565 Source data is deposited at the Zenodo repository .

A Spot - FRAP of 709 BRCA2 - HaloTag cells treated with mitomycin C by photobleaching a focus or region in the 710 cytoplasm ( 3 independent replicates , focus n = 40 , nucleoplasm n = 20 cells , shading around 711 the curve indicates SEM ) B Example of a single multi - focal plane image showing 9 z - plane 712 projections spaced 420 nm apart ; the signal of BRCA2 - Halo ( magenta ) and EGFP - tr53BP1 713 ( green ) is shown . C Approach for analysis of molecule tracks in and outside the foci , by 714 matching the localized molecules to the binary mask of the damage sites defined by the 715 53BP1 signal . D All track segments in the data set are annotated as being in or outside the 716 DSB foci and having a fast , slow , or immobile state . E , F Distribution of mean x - y ( 2D ) and x - 717 y - z ( 3D ) displacements for track segments outside versus inside the DSB foci mask . The plots 718 below show the distribution but for a random mask . G Fraction of localizations in and 719 outside the defined mask for the data compared to the random mask . The data consist of 4 720 independent experiments of 73 cells in total . See Movies S1 - 3 for movies of this data . p - 721 values are calculated from an unpaired 2 - sample Wilcox rank sum test . 722 723 724 Figure 2 : In - depth analysis of mobility in and outside the foci . A Scatter plot showing the 725 estimated apparent diffusion constant ( Dapp ) and anomalous exponent ( α ) distribution of 726 immobile ( blue , Dapp : 0 . 01 µm2 / s , α : 0 . 34 ) , slow ( light blue , Dapp : 0 . 053 , α : 0 . 60 ) and fast 727 ( red , Dapp : 0 . 43 , α : 0 . 93 ) tracklets of BRCA2 - HaloTag in mitomycin C treated cells . The black 728 points in the plot indicate the median values for each cluster . B For each diffusive state , 729 example of 100 MSD lines with the MSD fit using the power law equation and the medians 730 Dapp and α values . C The distribution of Dapp and α values per tracklet outside ( Dapp : 731 0 . 43 ; 0 . 05 ; 0 . 01 µm2 / s , α : 0 . 93 ; 0 . 62 ; 0 . 35 ) , inside ( Dapp : 0 . 42 ; 0 . 05 ; 0 . 01 µm2 / s , α : 0 . 87 ; 0 . 41 ; 0 . 32 ) 732 and inside the random mask ( Dapp : 0 . 46 ; 0 . 06 ; 0 . 01 µm2 / s , α : 0 . 97 ; 0 . 71 ; 0 . 36 ) . The histograms 733 display the overall distribution of all cells imaged . D Quantification of the distribution of 734 tracklets outside , inside and inside random mask . The indicated fraction is estimated from 735 the mean fraction per cell . E Angular distributions calculated between subsequent 736 localizations . Displacements of immobile molecules are excluded from the analysis . The 737 determined distribution of angles for BRCA2 is plotted for all molecules outside and inside 738 the damage site and compared to a randomized mask . F Angular distribution of fast and 739 slow - moving molecules G Distribution of the fold anisotropy ( ratio between backward angle 740 ( 180 + / - 15 degrees ) versus forward angle ( 0 + / - 15 degrees ) plotted against mean 741 displacement of the track . H Cumulative distribution of the displacements of the track 742 segments that transition from inside to outside ( left ) and from outside to inside ( right ) of the 743 foci , where immobile molecules are excluded from the distribution . Analysis in this figure is 744 done in 2D using the x - y coordinates in the tracking data .

B Quantification of the number of BRCA2 clusters within 753 individual automatically segmented 53BP1 foci . C - D Quantification of the size of the 754 respective clusters and the centre - to - centre distance between the clusters within the 755 individual foci . Data from 7 cells in total from two imaging sessions . Analysis of 7 images 756 with a total of 189 foci analyzed . Dashed line indicate the median of the distributions . E The 757 cellular concentration of BRCA2 was estimated by titration of increasing concentrations of 758 the labeled GST - HaloTag protein in the cell medium . The voxel intensity was used to 759 estimate the local concentration . F The nuclear concentration was estimated by 3D 760 segmentation of the cell nuclei . The nuclear concentration is defined as the average nuclear 761 concentration within all voxels in the 3D nuclear volume , whereas the number of BRCA2 762 molecules per nucleus is calculated by multiplying the concentration with the estimated 763 nuclear volume . G Within the identified nuclei , the foci were segmented in 3D . The image 764 shows an example of the segmentation in a single confocal slice . The plots show the results 765 of one replicate , results from additional replicates ( n = 3 ) are summarized in Fig . S6 . 766
