MILLER Krannert Graduate School of Management , Purdue University , West Lafayette , Indiana , USA We examine factors influencing the decision to acquire additional equity in partner firms in research - intensive industries . This decision involves choosing between flexibility and commit - ment . Option theory motivates hypotheses regarding the effects of uncertainty , valuation of developing technologies , and the threat of preemptive rivalry . Our main hypothesis is that the resolution of uncertainty for high - value technologies motivates commitment decisions . We also argue that when the underlying growth option is at risk of preemption by rivals , greater uncer - tainty encourages commitment . An event history model tests these hypotheses using data from minority investments in the biotechnology industry . Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Companies seeking to acquire new technologies with speed and efficiency often partner with firms having expertise in research and develop - ment ( R & D ) . In the last two decades , schol - ars have sought to understand whether R & D activities should be sourced through collabora - tions or brought ' in - house ' through acquisitions ( Williamson , 1985 ; Armour and Teece , 1977 ; Folta , 1998 ) . Recent evidence suggests , however , that these two strategies may be complementary . Acquisitions of target firms are frequently pre - ceded by equity investments in the targets ( Mikkel - son and Ruback , 1985 ; Choi , 1991 ) . Despite the fact that partnerships transition toward acquisition , Key words : real option ; uncertainty ; equity partnership ; partner buyout * Correspondence to : Timothy B . Folta , Krannert Graduate School of Management , Purdue University , 1310 Krannert Building , West Lafayette , IN 47907 - 1310 , U . S . A . Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . there has been little theoretical and empirical attention to the determinants and timing of partner buyouts . Most studies on partnership termination ignore partner acquisitions or combine buyouts with other types of termination events . Thus , it remains a puzzle why collaborations sometimes end in acquisitions of partners . In examining partner buyouts , this study extends a developing literature using option theory to diag - nose the motives for incrementally committing to strategies through sequential investment processes ( e . g . , Kogut , 1991 ; McGrath , 1997 ; Rivoli and Salorio , 1996 ) . We extend the work employing real option theory to strategy in two important ways . First , rather than focus on joint venture acquisi - tions , we examine buyouts and equity purchases of partner firms subsequent to initial minority equity stakes . Given the increasing use of minor - ity equity investments in interfirm collaborations , the evidence regarding sequential commitments Received 16 February 1999 Final revision received 17 May 2001 78 T . B . Folta and K . D . Miller in partners , and the distinct nature of minority investments relative to joint ventures , we believe it is worth studying whether real option theory is useful for predicting sequential equity com - mitments in partner firms . Second , we consider unexplored relations that are illuminated by a careful and rigorous application of option theory . In particular , we examine the effects of exter - nal uncertainty - both directly and in combina - tion with other variables - on equity purchases . ' Of course , there are important differences between real options and financial options which also inform our hypotheses . 2 We examine acquisitions and equity purchases in existing biotechnology partners by established firms from outside of biotechnology . Because biotechnology represents a set of skills removed from traditional research in pharmaceuticals , agri - culture , and chemicals , a key objective of such investors is the internalization of R & D capabili - ties ( Office of Technology Assessment , 1991 ) . We test our hypotheses by modeling the hazard rate of partner buyouts and incremental equity purchases using a sample of equity collaborations . THEORY AND HYPOTHESES Similar to Kogut ( 1991 ) , who focused on joint ventures , we characterize minority investments in partner firms as two - stage compound options . A firm purchases a call option by buying an ini - tial equity stake conferring an inside position for subsequent equity purchases . Privileged access to information about the partner , along with contrac - tual , operational , and managerial links between the firms , give the equity investor an advantaged position relative to outsiders . Exercising the first stage - the buyout option - occurs when the firm makes further equity purchases granting a control - ling interest in the partner . Exercising the second stage option - the growth option - involves one , ' Consistent with definitions in the management literature , in this paper the term ' uncertainty ' refers to the unpredictability of the ( internal or external ) environment and ' risk ' refers to perfor - mance volatility . We focus on external uncertainty because the risks associated with irreversibility are greatest in the presence of uncertainty that is beyond the control of managers ( McDonald and Siegel , 1986 ; Dixit and Pindyck , 1994 : 346 ) . 2 Most importantly , real options are often shared , idiosyncratic , and untraded . For a broader discussion of the differences between real and financial options , see Kester ( 1984 ) and Lander and Pinches ( 1998 ) . or more likely several , discretionary investments to expand the business . Although the eventual exercise of future growth opportunities is the reason for initiating these real options , we focus on the first - stage buyout deci - sion . Buyouts may be either controlling - through acquiring a majority stake - or partial - through incremental equity purchases en route to a majority stake . The incremental investment approach limits downside exposure for the investing firm , while each stage provides them with valuable infor - mation about the technology ' s future prospects , enabling them to make better decisions regarding their commitment to the technology ( Roberts and Weitzman , 1981 ) . The influential Black - Scholes ( 1973 ) model pro - vides a disciplined starting point for identifying key variables relevant to valuing the partner buyout option . Although the values of buyout options are not directly observable , we can use proxies for the Black - Scholes option pricing variables , and from these make inferences about the values of buyout options . According to the Black - Scholes model , the value of a call option ( C ) prior to expiration is given by C = f ( S , X , a , T , r ) ( 1 ) where S corresponds to the partner value - in - cluding expected future cash flows from the existing business and the option value of future growth opportunities . The exercise price , X , is the organizational and monetary expenditure required to buy additional equity in the partner . Sigma , a , is the uncertainty of the partner ' s value ( S ) . The duration , T , is the length of time the buyout decision may be deferred ( i . e . , the time to option expiration ) . Although the risk - free rate of return , r , may also have a bearing on the optimal timing for exercising real options , its influence is weak and ambiguous for real options ( Dixit and Pindyck , 1994 : 13 - 14 ) . As a result , we do not include the risk - free interest rate in this study . The investing firm may choose to maintain flex - ibility by holding the buyout option , or increase its commitment by exercising the option . Prior to expiration , the option will only be exercised when the value of the underlying asset ( S ) exceeds the exercise price ( X ) by more than the value of hold - ing the option ( C ) : S - X > C ( S , X , a , T ) ( 2 ) Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 23 : 77 - 88 ( 2002 ) Research Notes and Commentaries 79 Merton ( 1973 ) argued that this inequality never holds for financial options because the value of a call option always exceeds the value of exercising the option and holding the underlying asset . Under this reasoning , options should only be exercised when they are about to expire . However , for real options there may be opportunity costs to delaying exercise . Early exercise decisions may be war - ranted if deferring buyout results in : ( 1 ) cash flows or learning sacrificed , or ( 2 ) diminished opportu - nities to preempt rivals . Although further equity commitment in a part - ner results in a loss of flexibility for the investor , such investment provides capital to the target to ensure further development of new technologies . Delaying capital infusion may not only push back cash flows emanating from the technology , but also impedes development and learning about the technology and its prospects for success . Roberts and Weitzman ( 1981 ) have shown that if learn - ing is enhanced by moving to the next stage of the project , there are incentives to speed up the rate of commitment . Acquiring a controlling stake may offer further learning advantages to investors who internalize the target to facilitate technology transfer . Such was the explanation when the Swiss drug company Sandoz AG ( now Novartis ) agreed to acquire the 96 . 4 percent it did not already own in Genetic Therapy Inc . for $ 295 million in July 1995 . Genetic therapy was a pioneer in gene ther - apy , holding several crucial patents , and doing clinical tests on a treatment for a severe form of brain cancer . Even though Sandoz had licensed the technology , they were eager to move faster . Daniel Vasella , the chief executive of the Swiss company ' s drug division said , ' We believe very strongly that gene therapy will transform medi - cal practice in the future . And we concluded that owning the technology outright would be very important to Sandoz ' ( quoted by Langreth and Hirsch , 1996 : section A : 3 ) . Thus , consistent with this example and our earlier discussion , deferring exercising buyout options may involve substantial opportunity costs , as it requires forgoing dividends in the form of cash flows or learning . Owing to these considerations , inequality ( 2 ) may apply to buyout options . It follows that the likelihood of exercising the buyout option should increase with the value of the target ( S in ( 2 ) ) . In addition to the value of future growth opportunities , target value includes cur - rent expected cash flows and the value of current Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . learning opportunities that can only be realized by committing additional resources to the partner . Hypothesis 1 : Increased partner valuation makes buyouts more likely . Greater external uncertainty ( a ) has been argued to increase incentives to delay irreversible invest - ment decisions ( e . g . , McDonald and Siegel , 1986 ) . Thus , we expect commitments to buy equity in partners to be less likely under high uncertainty . In contrast , when there is low uncertainty about future growth opportunities , there is little incen - tive to delay investment decisions . However , it is not necessarily the case that low uncertainty will be associated with partner buyout and the subse - quent exercise of growth opportunities . Resolution of uncertainty could result in termination of the partnership or even the target ' s demise . The effect of low uncertainty on the buyout decision depends upon whether the option is in - the - money ( S > X ) or out - of - the - money ( S < X ) . When uncertainty is low and valuation of the growth opportunity has increased we expect firms are more likely to exer - cise the option to buy out their partner . Hypothesis 2 : High uncertainty makes partner buyouts less likely . Hypothesis 3 : When low uncertainty is com - bined with high valuation , partner buyouts are more likely . All else being equal , investors would prefer a proprietary option because it affords them more time ( T ) before committing . Unlike financial options , however , the option to buy out the partner is generally not exclusive . It can be shared with other firms that also hold equity stakes in the target firm ( Kester , 1984 ) . Other equity holders can make bids for the partner . 3 Their actions , or threats of action , may not only shorten the time to expiration , but also may increase the competitive bidding and exercise price for the target firm . Such actions can cause the option to suddenly , and unexpectedly , expire , eliminating any value to holding the option . Thus , with buyout options that are not proprietary , the values of holding 3Trigeorgis ( 1991 ) , Sanchez ( 1993 ) , and Smit and Ankum ( 1993 ) also point to the competitive threat posed by rivals as a strategic consideration accelerating the exercising of real options . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 23 : 77 - 88 ( 2002 ) 80 T . B . Folta and K . D . Miller the call option ( C ) and exercising the buyout option ( S - X ) both decline due to reduced time to expiration and an increased exercise price . Owing to a reduced likelihood of being in - the - money , buyouts are less likely for shared buyout options than for exclusive partnerships . Hypothesis 4 : When buyout options are more proprietary ( i . e . , there are fewer equity partners associated with the targetfirm ) , partner buyout is more likely . Whether the option is proprietary may also moderate the hypothesized effect of uncertainty ( Hypothesis 2 ) . Under high uncertainty , if a buy - out option is proprietary and the underlying growth opportunity is unique , there is little incentive to accelerate investment in the partner . Deferring sunk investments makes sense because proceeding slowly limits the firm ' s downside risk . Alterna - tively , if we assume the buyout option is nonpro - prietary , the response to high uncertainty may be quite different . Higher uncertainty increases valu - ations of underlying growth opportunities . Kulati - laka and Perotti ( 1998 ) argued that under high uncertainty firms seek to accelerate investments in order to preempt rivals . In so doing , they estab - lish unique and proprietary positions that enhance and preserve the value of future growth oppor - tunities . Hence , high uncertainty may accelerate buyout investments when buyout options are non - proprietary . Hypothesis 5 : Under high uncertainty , the less proprietary a buyout option the more likely is partner buyout . The threat of preemption may not merely reside at the level of the target firm , but may exist more broadly in the competitive space of the technical subfield . Actions by rivals may nullify the value of the underlying growth opportunity . The greater the number of firms competing in a technical product area , the greater the likelihood that some other firm will develop a substitute technology that renders alternative technologies obsolete even before their development is completed . This effect is expected to hold because the number of rivals changes over time and firms do not have perfect foresight regarding entry and exit from their product area . The greater the threat of technological preemption by rivals , the less attractive is buying out the Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . partner . Holding the option , rather than acquiring the partner , defers sunk investments that could be lost if a rival technology captures the market . Hypothesis 6 : When growth options are more unique ( i . e . , there are fewer rivals in the product market ) partner buyout is more likely . RESEARCH DESIGN Sample Our sample consisted of minority equity collab - orations , in which established firms having core businesses outside of biotechnology take equity stakes in dedicated biotechnology firms domi - ciled in the United States . The North Carolina Biotechnology Center ( NCBC ) Actions Database and Bioscan provided data . We restricted our sam - ple to the four subfields ( therapeutics , diagnostics , agriculture ( ag / bio ) , and supplier / specialty chemi - cal ) encompassing the majority of firms dedicated to biotechnology ( Dibner , 1992 ) . These subfields were the only ones with enough public firms throughout the life of the industry to generate indices of stock market values . Given these con - straints on our database we identified 337 ( originat - ing ) equity collaborations initiated between 1978 and 1999 . Of these , we were unable to obtain the precise starting dates of 22 partnerships , despite supplementing our search using Lexis / Nexis and SEC Schedule 13D filings . We made considerable effort to verify the outcome of each partnership . If the October 1999 issue of Bioscan listed the equity partnership as ongoing , the partnership was coded as right censored . Otherwise , a systematic search was undertaken to understand the nature of the termination using sources in addition to NCBC and Bioscan , including Ernst & Young Biotech - nology Industry Reports , Predicast F & S Index of Corporate Change , Lexis / Nexis , Dow Jones News Service , and SEC Schedule 13D filings . This effort enabled us to verify the timing and outcome of 285 minority equity partnerships , constituting our final sample . Of these , 22 were terminated by purchases raising the ownership level to at least 50 percent , 122 were terminated by other means ( 87 were dissolved , 35 were acquired by third par - ties ) , and 141 were still in effect at the end of 1999 . Our data were not limited to information on majority ownership events , but included data Strat . Mgmt . J . , 23 : 77 - 88 ( 2002 ) Research Notes and Commentaries 81 on any equity investment in the biotechnology partners . There were 120 instances where estab - lished firms committed further capital to an exist - ing equity partner . 52 partnerships had one addi - tional equity investment , 17 partnerships had two additional investments , 10 partnerships had three or more additional investments . 205 partnerships did not have equity purchases after the initial stake . Model and method All of our analyses employed event - history tech - niques . We considered two different kinds of buyout events , and modeled their hazard rates sep - arately . The first set of models defined the depen - dent variable as the hazard rate of acquiring a majority stake , coded ' 1 ' when there were pur - chases that raised the ownership level to at least 50 percent of the biotechnology partner . The sec - ond set of models defined the dependent variable as the hazard rate of acquiring an additional stake , coded ' 1 ' when there were any purchases of equity subsequent to the initial ownership stake in the partner ( including purchases that raised the own - ership to or beyond the 50 percent level ) . Thus , this definition allows for repeated events , where there are multiple purchases of equity in a single biotechnology firm by a single established firm . In each case , the hazard rate is defined as A ( t ) = lim [ q ( t , t + At ) / At ] , At - - 0 ( 3 ) where q is the discrete probability of an event between t and ( t + At ) , conditional on the history of the process up to time t . The rate A ( t ) was specified as an exponential function of the independent variables , X , , and a vector of parameters capturing the effects of the variables on the rate of subsequent equity investment such that X ( t ) = exp ( a ' X , ) ( 4 ) The exponential distribution is suitable for mod - eling data with a constant hazard and when there is no a priori expectation as to the nature of the distribution . Observations were coded as right cen - sored if they were still in effect at the end of 1999 . To avoid biasing our results , terminations by part - nership dissolution , acquisition of the target firm by a third party , or shutting down of the biotech - nology firm were coded as distinct competing Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . events . Parameters were estimated by the method of maximum likelihood using STATA . One key assumption used for maximum likeli - hood estimation is that there is independence of failure times ( i . e . , event times are uncorrelated across observations ) . In our sample , each minority investor in a target biotechnology firm was treated as a distinct observation . Because a target firm may have equity purchases by multiple partners , the assumption of independence of the events is highly questionable . Using standard event history estima - tion approaches , the covariance matrix does not take into account this interdependence of events ( Lin , 1994 ) . To adjust for this , we used the ' clus - ter ' option in STATA , originally proposed by Lin and Wei ( 1989 ) . In Table 2 we report the adjusted standard error for each coefficient . Variables Table 1 provides descriptive statistics and pair - wise correlations for all independent variables . This section explains these variables , with partic - ular emphasis on the key variables relating to the constructs in the hypotheses : target firm valuation , exogenous uncertainty , and whether the option is proprietary . Firm valuation We computed two measures of target firm value : ( 1 ) a stock market index of public firms active in the firm ' s technological subfield , and ( 2 ) a proxy for the ability to attract capital from public mar - kets . In the biotechnology industry , the pay - offs to investments vary considerably across technology subfields because of differences in aggregate fac - tors , such as the likelihood of commercialization , regulatory requirements , development time hori - zons , and product demand . Like Folta ( 1998 ) , we captured differences in expected value and growth potential across the four subfields ( therapeutics , diagnostics , ag / bio , and supplier / specialty chemi - cal ) by creating four stock indices from weekly returns of nine publicly traded , U . S . biotechnol - ogy firms specializing in the respective subfields . Thus , subfield value was the difference in the value of the monthly biotechnology index for the target ' s subfield since initiation of the equity partnership . Each index ranges from April 1984 to December 1999 . Because of data limitations , any dates prior Strat . Mgmt . J . , 23 : 77 - 88 ( 2002 ) 00 ( s ) Table 1 .

As such , we measure target firm value as the dif - ference in the number of public offerings since the initiation of the equity partnership . This mea - sure should be particularly appropriate in biotech - nology , where burn ratios are high and raising capital to fund growth opportunities is a constant undertaking . Firms with larger growth opportuni - ties should be able to raise more funds . The data came from S & P NetAdvantage . equity position in a single target firm , that option is shared . The number of equity partners is calcu - lated as the log of the number of established firms with equity partnerships outstanding in the target firm in the previous month . The logarithm transfor - mation reflects our belief in a declining marginal impact of competitive bidding with each additional partner . 5 The number of rivals actively developing prod - ucts in the same product domain was the total number of firms having stated their involvement in any of Bioscan ' s 123 biotechnology product areas . This variable is time - varying on an annual basis throughout the time horizon of this study . Control variables Uncertainty We measured uncertainty as the 26 - week standard deviation of weekly returns for each of the four biotechnology subfield indices . The 26 - week mea - sure was chosen because it provides enough history to produce a reliable measure of volatility , without assuming constant variance over a longer period of time . Exogenous uncertainty was converted to a monthly measure by averaging the weekly standard deviations within any given month . The standard deviation of a stock market index represents uncer - tainty that is specific to the industry subfield and exogenous to the control of individual firms . Other potential measures of uncertainty , such as variance in revenues , are not applicable in biotechnology , because the majority of firms lack revenues from product commercialization . How proprietary is the option ? The most likely candidates to buy out the partner should come from among existing equity part - ners , rather than outside firms . Outside bidders are subject to adverse selection due to asymmetric information about firm value ( Williamson , 1985 ; Balakrishnan and Koza , 1993 ) . Bulow , Huang , and Klemperer ( 1996 ) showed that outside bidders face an increased winner ' s curse if a firm with an established equity position bids more aggressively . They suggested that a controlling minority share - holder may be immune to outside offers . How - ever , when more than one established firm has an 4See Folta ( 1998 ) for more details on construction of these indices . We included control variables related to the nature of the option , the target firm , and the established partner . License was coded ' 1 ' if a technol - ogy licensing agreement was initiated simulta - neous to the equity agreement , and ' 0 ' other - wise . Information regarding licensing agreements was gained from the NCBC database , Bioscan , or news announcements found in the Dow Jones News Service . The presence of a licensing agree - ment indicates interfirm linkages beyond the equity stake that enhance the investor ' s inside position ( relative to outside bidders ) . Option was coded ' 1 ' if there was an explicit contractual buyout agreement or a specific option to acquire addi - tional equity at a prespecified price , and ' 0 ' oth - erwise . Information for this variable was obtained from news announcements in the sources identified earlier . Target firm control variables were also used . Tar - get firms having a greater number of commercial alliances may have more claims on their future growth opportunities , limiting the upside poten - tial to capture value through acquisition . We used the number of private equity placements to con - trol for the propensity for firms to be closely held by venture capitalists or institutional investors . The number of biotechnology sectors captures the 5 It might be argued that a proprietary option is exclusive to a single firm . Once any number of other ( from one to many ) firms share the option , its value changes drastically . Although our logarithmic transformation is meant to capture declining marginal effects , we might also justify a dichotomous indicator variable for any investors beyond a single one . We tested models using this dichotomous measure and found the overall model fit lower than with the logarithmic transformation of the continuous measure . Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd .

Firms active in more than one technological sector may have more extensive growth options associated with them . Firm age was measured as the log of firm years ( number of days since founding divided by 365 ) , due to our belief that the marginal impact of age declines . Finally , established firms may have different alliance strategies resulting in different patterns of exercise decisions . To account for differing strategies , we measured the alliance experience of the established firm by calculating the total number of equity partnerships that the established firm had outstanding in the month prior to the observation .

The base - line Model 1 is a significant improvement over an unreported constant rate model . A likelihood ratio test , comparing Model 2 to Model 1 , pro - duced a chi - square statistic ( X2 = 8 . 54 , 5 d . f . ) below the critical value of 11 . 07 , suggesting that the joint addition of the independent variables did not significantly add to the model fit for acquisi - tion of majority stakes . Despite this lack of overall explanatory power , the individual coefficient on uncertainty suggests that acquisition of majority stakes is more likely in the presence of lower uncertainty ( p < 0 . 10 ) , consistent with expecta - tions . The main conclusion , however , is that we do not have an overall significant effect associated with our theory - driven relations for acquisition of majority stakes . This may be due to the fol - lowing : ( 1 ) the theory does not explain majority - stake buyouts , ( 2 ) our measures or specification are inadequate , and / or ( 3 ) our sample size is insuf - ficient . Acquisitions of additional stakes The models examining acquisitions of additional equity stakes ( any purchases of equity subsequent to the initial ownership stake in biotechnology firms ) are also reported in Table 2 . Model 3 is the baseline model . Model 4 includes the main effects . Model 5 introduces the hypothesized interaction effects involving uncertainty . Once again , the base - line Model 3 provides a significant improvement over an unreported constant rate model . A likeli - hood ratio test comparing Model 4 to the base - line Model 3 produced a chi - square statistic of 74 . 26 , exceeding the critical value of 11 . 07 for five degrees of freedom . This indicates that the joint addition of the hypothesized main - effect vari - ables significantly adds to the explanation of pur - chases of additional equity . A likelihood ratio test to compare Model 4 to the model including inter - action terms ( 5 ) produced a chi - square statistic of 58 . 39 , exceeding the critical value of 7 . 81 for three degrees of freedom . We use the full Model 5 to interpret the hypothesized relations regarding addi - tional equity purchases , and use two - tailed t - tests to interpret individual coefficients . First , we examined the main and interaction effects pertaining to firm value . The two valua - tion variables ( subfield value and number of public offerings ) have significant total effects ( p < 0 . 001 ) , Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . where total effects are defined as the combination of both main and interaction effects . 6 Examina - tion of the individual coefficients is quite revealing . The negative interaction between subfield value and uncertainty ( p < 0 . 001 ) is consistent with expecta - tions in Hypothesis 3 . It suggests that higher valu - ation of growth opportunities coupled with lower uncertainty increase the likelihood of additional equity purchases . Using coefficients from Model 5 , Figure l ( a ) illustrates the effects of subfield value over the variable ' s range at three different levels of uncertainty : the mean of uncertainty for the entire sample , the mean uncertainty plus a standard devi - ation , and the mean uncertainty minus a standard deviation . The vertical axis represents the multiplier for the hazard of additional equity purchases result - ing from the combined effects of subfield value and uncertainty , while other variables are held con - stant . Figure l ( a ) shows that increases in subfield value had a greater impact on the rate of additional equity purchases for low levels of uncertainty . This is evidenced by the steep increase in the hazard rate multiplier over the range of subfield value for low levels of uncertainty . The figure also reflects the positive main effect of subfield value on the rate of additional equity purchases , supporting Hypoth - esis 1 . The positive coefficient for the interaction between number of public offerings and uncer - tainty ( p < 0 . 05 ) is inconsistent with Hypothesis 3 . Thus , Hypotheses 1 and 3 received support using the subfield value valuation measure , but not using the number of public offerings valuation measure . With respect to Hypothesis 2 , we expected acquisi - tion of additional equity stakes to be more likely in the presence of low uncertainty . A likelihood ratio test reveals that uncertainty has a significant total effect ( i . e . , main effect together with associated interactions ) . Furthermore , the coefficient remains stable across Models 4 and 5 . The uncertainty coef - ficient in Model 4 suggests that decreases in uncer - tainty of 10 percent multiplies the rate of acquiring additional equity by 1 . 79 ( = e [ - 5 . 869x - 0 . ' 0 ] ) . Thus , Hypothesis 2 is supported . The effects pertaining to whether the option is proprietary ( Hypotheses 4 and 5 ) received sup - port . The number of equity partners has a signifi - cant total effect , and the positive interaction effect between number of equity partners and uncertainty 6Total effects for a variable were determined by using a likeli - hood ratio test comparing Model 5 to unreported models exclud - ing the variable and its interaction with uncertainty .

Strat . Mgmt . J . , 23 : 77 - 88 ( 2002 ) Research Notes and Commentaries 87 indicates that less proprietary options are exercised at a faster rate in the presence of high uncer - tainty . This finding is consistent with Hypothe - sis 5 . Figure l ( b ) illustrates the effect of number of equity partners at different levels of uncertainty . The figure shows that the predicted likelihood of partial buyouts decreases steeply over the range of number equity partners for low levels of uncer - tainty , but the rate of acquiring additional equity increases over the range of number of equity part - ners for high levels of uncertainty . The range of the vertical axis in Figure l ( b ) indicates that the num - ber of equity partners has an overall negative effect on acquiring additional equity , a finding consis - tent with Hypothesis 4 . Our results do not support Hypothesis 6 as the coefficient for number of rivals is not significant . Of the control variables , number of commer - cial alliances , presence of a contractual buyout option , number of private equity placements , and number of biotechnology sectors have significant effects on the rate of acquiring additional equity . The rate of acquiring additional equity increases when target firms have few commercial alliances , no explicit option agreement , more private equity placements , and participate in more biotechnology sectors . DISCUSSION Buyouts of research partners occur frequently , but have not been explained by previous research . This article sought to rigorously explore how option the - ory illuminates this phenomenon , recognizing the differences between real and financial options . On a conceptual level , we argued that although delay - ing commitment is optimal for financial options , there may be opportunity costs to waiting to exer - cise real options - firms may forgo cash flows or opportunities to learn , or they may be pre - empted by rivals . Minority investments in partner firms do not provide investing firms proprietary options . When partner buyout options are nonpro - prietary , there may be strong incentives to exercise an option , particularly as the underlying growth option becomes more valuable . In the empirical portion of the article , we tested several relations not previously examined in the real option literature . Despite the promi - nent role of uncertainty in this literature , nei - ther main nor moderating effects of uncertainty have been explicitly examined in prior empirical real option research within the field of strategic management . As expected , we found that part - ner buyouts are more likely with lower uncer - tainty . Firm valuation - as reflected in subfield value - had a strong positive effect on the deci - sion to purchase more equity in the partner . This effect is stronger in the presence of low uncer - tainty , a finding we believe is consistent with Kogut ' s ( 1991 ) study on joint ventures . Our focus on minority equity partnerships also enabled us to examine whether option exercise is influenced by how proprietary the option is . We found that more proprietary buyout options were more likely to be exercised , particularly in low - uncertainty environments . However , as buyout options are increasingly shared , greater uncertainty motivates a quicker exercise decision . The preemptive nature of early commitment is quite intuitive and has been studied extensively ( e . g . , Ghemawat , 1991 ) , but our study places new emphasis on the moderating role of uncertainty in preemptive buyout decisions . Firms appear to move quickly to capture the value associated with nonproprietary options as uncer - tainty increases . The growing number of different forms of inter - firm collaborations , as well as the increased atten - tion to the performance implications of these col - laborations , raises important questions about why these collaborations arise and how they evolve over time . The present article was confined to examining whether real option theory explains partner buyouts among biotechnology research partners . It remains for future research to address the extent to which real option theory aids in explaining partner buyouts in other industry con - texts , or other types of collaborations , such as nonequity collaboration ( Folta and Leiblein , 1994 ) . We hope that this article provides an impetus for additional empirical work taking a strategic man - agement perspective on real options . We encourage both careful examination of the assumptions under - lying real option pricing models in finance and deviations from those assumptions where neces - sary to allow for market failures , and managerial and organizational realities .
