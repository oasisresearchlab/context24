This gene normally encodes the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) , a major cytoskeletal regulator expressed in hematopoietic cells . Gene therapy is a promising option for the treatment of WAS , requiring that clinically applicable WASP gene transfer vectors demon - strate efﬁcacy in preclinical studies . Here , we describe a self - inactivating HIV - 1 - derived lentiviral vector encoding human WASP and show that it effectively transduced bone marrow progenitor cells of WASP knockout ( WKO ) mice . Transplan - tation of these transduced cells into lethally irradiated WKO recipients led to stable expression of WASP and correction of immune , inﬂammatory and cytoskeletal defects . Splenic T - cell proliferation was restored , podosomes were reinstated on bone - marrow - derived dendritic cells and colon inﬂamma - tion was reduced . This shows for the ﬁrst time ( a ) that cytoskeletal defects can be corrected in WKO mice , ( b ) that human WASP is biologically active in mice and ( c ) that a lentiviral vector is effective to express human WASP in vivo over several months . These data support further develop - ment of such lentiviral vectors for the gene therapy of WAS .

When these mutations result in the absence of WASP protein expression , the disease is severe . 5 The WASP gene is also mutated in X - linked thrombopenia ( XLT ) , where patients exhibit an attenuated disease . 6 WASP is a 502 amino - acid cytoplasmic protein expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells . WASP is a key member of a family of cytoskeletal regulators that link signaling pathways to actin cytoskeleton reorganiza - tion by activating Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymeriza - tion . 1 , 2 Actin remodeling plays an important role in cellular responses allowing changes in shape or motility , enabling endocytosis , vesicular trafﬁcking and mem - brane reorganization . In T cells , WASP is an essential aspect of the signal transduction cascade initiated by T - cell receptor engagement , contributing to the establish - ment of immunological synapse and full T - cell activa - tion . 7 , 8 Actin remodeling via WASP has also an important function in NK cells , being involved in the formation of an activating immune synapse . 9 In cells such as macro - phages , osteoclasts and dendritic cells ( DC ) , WASP is essential for the formation of podosomes , which are actin - rich structures that enable cellular adhesion , motility and proteolytic processes . 10 , 11 Several mutant WASP knockout ( WKO ) strains have been generated and are lympho - penic , mildly thrombopenic and exhibit T - cell activation defects . 12 , 13 When bred on the SV129 genetic background , WKO develop chronic colitis with leukocytic inﬁltration in the intestinal mucosa . 14 WKO mice constitute adequate models for the T - cell - mediated immune deﬁciency in the human WAS disease . T - cell receptor - induced activation , actin polymerization , capping and CD3 internalization are strongly impaired in WKO T cells . T - cell proliferation defects accompanied with reduced production of IL - 2 and cytoskeletal anomalies are also observed in these mice , modeling some of the dysfunctions observed in WAS patient T cells . 15 , 16 The life expectancy of WAS patients is limited and death occurs after bleeding , recurrent infections or malignancies . At present , WAS patients can be kept alive for over 10 years by conventional supportive care and splenectomy . Successful treatment is possible with allogeneic bone marrow transplant , but complications are increased and this procedure is not available to all patients . 17 Thus , gene therapy via autologous hemato - Received 2 June 2004 ; accepted 13 September 2004 ; published online 16 December 2004 Correspondence : Dr A Galy , Genethon , 1bis rue de l’Internationale , Evry 91002 , France Gene Therapy ( 2005 ) 12 , 597 – 606 & 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0969 - 7128 / 05 $ 30 . 00 www . nature . com / gt poietic cell transplants appears to be a promising therapeutic option , applicable in principle to all patients . Proof - of - principle experiments have shown that onco - retroviral vectors can be used to express WASP cDNA in various human and murine cells including T and B cells or hematopoietic progenitor cells . Retroviral - mediated WASP gene transfer in WAS patient B and T cells increases actin polymerization in vitro , 18 and in the case of T cells , normalizes anti - CD3 - induced proliferation . 15 , 16 Transplantation of transduced WKO hematopoietic progenitor cells into RAG - 2 KO animals gives rise to functional peripheral lymph node T cells and colitis fails to develop in these animals . 14 Furthermore , WKO transplanted with retrovirally transduced progenitor cells become capable of T - cell responses to an inﬂuenza virus challenge . 19 While these experiments show that immune impairments can be corrected in murine models of WAS , there is little information on effective vector doses and it is unclear if defects other than those occurring in Tcells can be corrected . Clinically applicable vectors have not yet been developed . Prior studies in mice utilized vectors encoding murine WASP , often containing reporter genes . It is not known if vectors encoding human WASP can correct functional defects in WKO mice . Here , we have used a self - inactivating HIV - 1 - derived vector for the gene transfer of human WASP . This vector effectively transduced murine WKO bone marrow progenitor cells , providing in vivo multifunctional correc - tion after transplantation . Thus , lentiviral vectors can be envisioned for further development for the gene therapy of WAS . Results Production of an HIV - 1 - derived vector for WASP gene expression An advanced - generation , self - inactivating lentiviral vec - tor , HIV - PGK - huWASP - WPRE , was constructed to ex - press a full - length human WASP cDNA under the control of the human phospho - glycerate kinase ( PGK ) promoter ( Figure 1a ) . This vector , derived from a previously described backbone , includes the cPPT / cts element and the woodchuck hepatitis post - transcrip - tional regulatory element ( WPRE ) to increase transgene expression . 20 The vector was pseudotyped with VSV - G and concentrated by ultracentrifugation . Two separate productions of vectors had titers of 1 . 7 and 1 . 2 (cid:1) 10 10 viral genome ( VG ) / ml . The vector was functional in human cells as it induced WASP protein and gene expression in various WASP - negative cell lines including 293Tcells , HT1080 cells and a WAS patient B - cell line that was strongly deﬁcient in WASP protein and mRNA expression ( data not shown ) . Transduction of murine bone marrow ( BM ) - derived cells The vector was tested in murine WKO BM cells . BM - nucleated cells ( BM - C ) were prestimulated with cyto - kines and transduced with several concentrations of the HIV - PGK - huWASP - WPRE vector . This induced a dose - dependent increase in human WASP mRNA expression as measured by quantitative RT - PCR analysis 48 h postinfection ( Table 1 – Experiment 1 ) . In a separate experiment , infected BM - C were transduced and cul - tured for 2 weeks to prepare BM - derived dendritic cells ( BM - DC ) . Human WASP mRNA was also induced in a dose - dependent manner in these BM - DC ( Table 1 – Experiment 2 ) . A population enriched in hematopoietic progenitor cells was obtained in the lineage negative ( Lin (cid:2) ) BM cell fraction that is depleted of mature erythrocytes , granulocytes , myeloid , T and B cells . The transduction of Lin (cid:2) BM cells with the vector also resulted in dose - dependent increases in human WASP mRNA expression ( Table 1 – Experiments 3 and 4 ) . Altogether , these results show that the vector transduced murine WKO hematopoietic cells . Transplantation of transduced Lin (cid:2) BM cells As a preclinical model , WKO mice were conditioned by lethal irradiation , injected with transduced Lin (cid:2) cells and vector integration was measured after 3 months . For this , we used cells from Table 1 – Experiment 4 ( treated , or not , with vector 1 (cid:1) 10 7 or 1 (cid:1) 10 8 VG / ml ) , which were from a male donor and injected into female recipients . Wild - type male Lin (cid:2) cells , processed identically but not transduced , were also injected as controls . Irradiated but non - transplanted mice died rapidly , whereas 75 – 100 % transplanted WKO animals survived at 3 months . At such time , blood cell counts were back to pretransplant values . Donor chimerism in blood was measured by quantitative genomic PCR calibrated on a curve of male / female blood cells ( Figure 2a ) . Average proportion of donor cells was comparable in all experimental groups and estimated to be 60 – 80 % ( Figure 2b ) . Human WASP DNA was found selectively in the blood of animals that received transduced cells ( Figure 2c ) , thus conﬁrming the methodology . Average numbers of vector copies in donor cells were 0 . 39 7 0 . 39 in the low vector dose group and 1 . 9 7 1 . 2 in the higher vector dose group ( Figure 2d ) . Altogether , these results show that transduced Lin (cid:2) cells integrated the transgene in a dose - dependent manner and were able to engraft into mice . Figure 1 Design of the HIV - PGK - human WASP - WPRE lentiviral construct . A lentiviral vector for the gene therapy of Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome S Charrier et al 598 Gene Therapy Expression of WASP mRNA and protein in transplanted animals Animals were killed 5 months post - transplantation to examine human WASP mRNA and protein expression . Results showed that human WASP mRNA was detect - able in the BM of all mice transplanted with transduced progenitor cells but absent in control animals ( Table 2 ) . As expected , murine WASP mRNA was only found in mice transplanted with wild - type progenitor cells . Western blot analysis was performed on total protein extracts from spleen using an antibody reactive both to human and murine WASP . Results showed that the WASP protein was induced in animals transplanted with transduced cells ( Figure 3 ) . In some of the mice treated with the higher concentration of vector , the levels of WASP protein expression were similar to that of animals engrafted with wild - type cells . Altogether , these results demonstrate long - term expression of human WASP mRNA and protein in vivo . Functional restoration of T - cell function WKO T cells fail to proliferate when stimulated via T - cell receptor . 12 This can be corrected in vivo after retroviral - mediated gene transfer of murine WASP into WKO progenitor cells and their transplantation into lympho - penic animals . 14 , 19 In our model , anti - CD3 - induced proliferation of spleen cells was corrected in all but one mouse . As expected , splenic cells from WKO mice transplanted with nontransduced WKO cells did not proliferate , whereas those engrafted with wild - type Lin (cid:2) cells did ( Table 2 ) . These results show that gene transfer of human WASP effectively corrected the T - cell prolif - eration defect in WKO mice . Functional restoration of DC podosomes Cytoskeletal anomalies are particularly pronounced in macrophages and in immature DCs lacking WASP . 1 Normally , these cells elaborate podosomes , which are characteristic adhesion structures that form upon cell – substrate contact and localize at the substrate attached portion of the cell . Podosomes consist of a ring structure of approximately 0 . 5 m m containing vinculin , actin and talin ( recently reviewed by Linder and Aepfelbacher 21 ) Table 1 huWASP mRNA expression after in vitro transduction of WKO BM cells Vector ( VG / ml ) Ratio huWASP / mTFIID mRNA a BM - C BM - DC BM Lin (cid:2) cells Experiment1 Experiment2 Experiment3 Experiment4 0 0 0 0 0 5 (cid:1) 10 6 0 . 9 NT 0 . 6 NT 1 (cid:1) 10 7 1 1 1 1 2 . 5 (cid:1) 10 7 NT NT 1 . 5 NT 5 (cid:1) 10 7 8 . 7 NT 4 . 6 NT 1 (cid:1) 10 8 12 . 5 2 . 6 NT 7 . 6 NT ¼ not tested . a mRNA levels were determined by real - time RT - PCR 48 h ( or 14 days in the case of BM - DC ) post - transduction based on standard curves of human LCL and mouse MNC cDNAs for human WASP and mouse TFIID mRNAs , respectively . Results were expressed as the ratio of human WASP over mouse TFIID mRNAs , normalized in each experiment to the sample transduced at the concentration of 1 (cid:1) 10 7 VG / ml . All samples were produced from similar amounts of total RNA and expressed equivalent values of mouse TFIID mRNA .

Preliminary experiments examined podosome formation in immature BM - DC transduced in vitro with the lentiviral vector ( cells from Table 1 – Experiment 2 ) . Cultures treated with 1 (cid:1) 10 7 and 1 (cid:1) 10 8 VG / ml contained , respectively , 7 . 5 and 32 % BM - DC with podosomes . Thus , WKO mice have a marked defect in podosome assembly and this can be corrected by lentiviral - mediated human WASP expres - sion . Hence , immature BM - derived DC obtained from mice 5 months post - transplantation were tested for this activity ( Table 2 and Figure 4 ) . Figure 4a illustrates that BM - DC from mice transplanted with WKO cells failed to organize podosome structures . Occasionally , very small ring - like structures were observed but these were not at the cells leading edge . In contrast , BM - DC from mice engrafted with wild - type cells showed numerous and large podosome clusters ( Figure 4b ) . DC obtained from transduced animals showed partial restoration of the ability to form podosomes ( Figure 4c and d ) . Table 2 shows that in the low vector concentration group , the percentage of cells was low but reached near normal levels in the high vector concentration group . These results demonstrate that cytoskeletal anomalies in myeloid cells can be corrected with the lentiviral vector encoding human WASP . Colitis WKO mice as well as T - deﬁcient RAG2KO mice transplanted with WKO cells , develop colitis which has been described with thickening of the walls , thickening of the mucosa with crypt hyperplasia and a mixed inﬁltrate of lymphocytes and neutrophils within the lamina propria . 12 Here , mice engrafted with WKO cells Table 2 Analysis 5 months post - transplantation mWASP mRNA in BM a huWASP mRNA in BM b Spleen T - cell proliferation ( CPM ) Percent BM - DC with podosomes c Colon histology d Inﬂammation Dedifferentiation Transplanted animals Lin (cid:2) WT 1 1 0 3039 7 556 27 + + + , focally + + + + 00 2 1 . 3 0 54 664 7 149 NT + + 00 3 0 . 95 0 21 941 7 1272 NT + + 00 4 1 . 2 0 14 224 7 651 NT + + 00 5 0 . 8 0 31 835 7 1426 25 + 0 00 6 0 . 7 0 162 650 7 11 963 NT + 0 00 7 0 . 8 0 51 139 7 2208 17 + 0 Lin (cid:2) WKO 1 0 0 1314 7 268 NT + + to + + + + 00 2 0 0 952 7 501 2 + + + + + + 00 3 0 0 844 7 15 4 + + + + Lin (cid:2) WKO 1 (cid:1) 10 7 1 0 1 . 9 18 585 7 3426 8 + + + , focally + + + 00 2 0 0 . 3 1220 7 123 2 + + + to + + + + to 0 00 3 0 0 . 3 55 910 7 23 525 6 + + + + Lin (cid:2) WKO 1 (cid:1) 10 8 1 0 4 . 1 15 078 7 1361 19 + to + + + 00 2 0 1 . 6 46 475 7 12 830 18 + + + + 00 3 0 6 . 7 34 649 7 7664 16 + + NT ¼ not tested . a mWASP mRNAvalues were normalized to mouse 1 transplanted with Lin (cid:2) WTcells .

The mucosa was thicknened and asso - ciated with a pseudopolypoid pattern , which resembled the hallmark of ulcerative colitis in humans ( Figure 5 ) . In contrast , most WKO mice transplanted with wild - type cells showed normal mucosal architecture with no signs of inﬂammation ( Table 2 and Figure 5 ) .

Based on the criteria of inﬂammation and dedifferentiation , we observed a variable colon histology in animals engrafted with transduced cells . Two of the mice had little signs of inﬂammation and exhibited near normal colon histology . Most mice showed some degree of leukocyte inﬁltration and mucosal dedifferentiation , but foci of normal areas could be observed in some samples . These results show that the development of colitis can be prevented in some of the WKO animals reconstituted with human WASP . Discussion A prerequisite for the development of a gene therapy protocol is to demonstrate the efﬁciency of clinically applicable vectors in relevant models of the disease . We report for the ﬁrst time that a self - inactivating HIV - derived lentiviral vector expressing human WASP effectively transduced hematopoietic cells of WASP - deﬁcient mice , thereby correcting multiple biological anomalies including peripheral T - cell function , colitis or DC cytoskeletal anomalies in vivo . This is the ﬁrst time that cytoskeletal defects are shown to be corrected in this model . This is also the ﬁrst time that human WASP is shown to substitute for its murine counterpart . This latter ﬁnding is not entirely unexpected since nucleotide sequence homology in WASP gene of both human and mouse species is on average 87 % in the WH1 and GTP - binding regions and 82 % in the VCA region . However , this facilitates preclinical vector validation . WAS is a multifactorial disease and correcting multi - ple anomalies in several lineages of WASP - deﬁcient cells is probably required for optimal therapeutic beneﬁt . Dysfunctions in T cells are believed to be central to the immunodeﬁciency exhibited by WAS patients . Periph - eral T - cell defects are well - characterized in WKO mice and include a reproducible decrease in T - cell - receptor - induced T - cell proliferation . 12 Our results showed that ex vivo transduction of hematopoietic cells with the lentiviral vector restored T - cell proliferation in almost all animals treated , thus validating the model and gene transfer technique . Others have shown with retroviral vectors that correcting T - cell proliferation of WKO T cells also normalized T - cell cytokine production and cytotoxic activity . 19 As reported elsewhere , 13 we ﬁnd that WKO mice have reduced proportions of CD4 + CD8 + double - positive thymocytes compared to wild - type mice ( data not shown ) . After transplant , almost all mice engrafted with untreated WKO cells had involuted thymi , but half of those engrafted with transduced WKO cells had thymi containing double - positive thymocytes ( 46 – 73 % ) , sug - gesting that central T - cell development may also be improved by correction of WASP gene expression . Clearly , more studies are needed to further analyze the various aspects of T - cell defects and their correction after gene therapy . The absence of WASP also perturbs the function of cells in the myeloid monocytic lineage such as DC . Yet , evidence was lacking that cells other than T - lymphocytes could be targeted and corrected in vivo after WASP gene transfer . Immature DC of WAS patients have defective podosome assembly and this cytoskeletal defect can be corrected in vitro by microinjection of a WASP plasmid in the cells . 22 Here , we found similar defects in podosome assembly of WKO BM - DC , and this was corrected by lentiviral - mediated expression of the human WASP gene in mice . High concentrations of vector induced a near normal frequency of cells with podosome clusters and these structures were of similar size than wild - type cells . Surprisingly , the low dose of vector was not as effective . Perhaps , high levels of WASP protein are required to sustain cytoskeletal regulation in the monocytic / DC lineage of cells . XLT patients show that partial reduction of WASP protein is sufﬁcient to cause defects in podosome assembly in macrophages , 23 which is consistent with the idea that such cells may need high levels of WASP protein to function optimally . Normally , macrophages and immature DC elaborate podosomes that serve to polarize the cells during chemotactic responses . 22 It is commonly accepted that cytoskeletal anomalies in leukocyte subsets of WAS patients underlie their inability to migrate normally . 1 Therefore , correcting cytoskeletal anomalies in antigen - presenting cells should improve innate and adaptive immune responses where migration plays an important role . The comparison of two concentrations of vector indicates dose - dependent effects on numbers of integra - tion , mRNA , protein levels and , within the limits of interpretation of a relatively small cohort of animals , suggests that dose is correlated to biological recovery . We notice that both animals with the highest levels of WASP mRNA had little inﬂammation of the colon , had improved podosomes and T - cell proliferation . Interest - ingly , some mice in the low - dose group normalized T - cell responses but not podosome formation or colitis . The underlying mechanisms regulating the development of colonic inﬂammation in WKO mice remain unclear but are likely to be multifactorial and may require migratory or other cytoskeletal functions that are not optimally restored . Suboptimal transduction could nevertheless be sufﬁcient to confer a proliferative advantage to WASP - expressing T cells as previously documented in compe - titive transplantation experiments . 14 , 16 Thus , gene therapy of WAS may need to achieve a threshold level of expression to correct anomalies of multiple types of hematopoietic cells and their various functions . Lentiviral vectors efﬁciently transduce hematopoietic stem / progenitor cells ex vivo and we conﬁrmed that a single exposure of these cells to deﬁned concentrations of vector led to sustained WASP protein and mRNA expression for extended periods of time ( 5 months ) in mice . Future experiments are needed to conﬁrm that long - term hematopoietic stem cells can be targeted to provide long - lasting correction in the WAS model . A recent study shows that an identical vector but encoding eGFP instead of WASP targets long - term repopulating stem cells by showing multilineage high levels of transgene expression in secondary recipient mice . 24 Furthermore , vectors with a similar backbone are known to efﬁciently transduce human primitive hema - topoietic progenitor cells such as CD34 + CD38 – cells or SCID - repopulating cells . 25 Thus , HIV - derived lentiviral vectors appear to be promising candidates for stem cell - based ex vivo gene therapy . The higher concentration of vector that we used provided on average two vector integrations per blood cell in mice ( Figure 2d ) and three vector copies in BM - DC ( cells tested in Table 1 ) . Such numbers are in the same range ( 2 (cid:2) 5 ) to those providing A lentiviral vector for the gene therapy of Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome S Charrier et al 602 Gene Therapy therapeutic beneﬁt after lentiviral - mediated gene trans - fer , for instance b - globin in a mouse model of sickle cell disease 26 or arylsulfatase A in a mouse model of metachromatic leukodystrophy . 24 Obtaining biological or therapeutic effects with low numbers of integrated vector copies per cell is important due to safety concerns related to the use of integrative vectors . Insertional mutagenesis has become a serious concern in the gene therapy of immunodeﬁciencies , since lymphoid malig - nancies developed after enforced expression of common g - chain using oncoretroviral vectors in hematopoietic progenitor cells . 27 These events seemed to only develop in children treated as neonates , suggesting that their hematopoiesis may be different from the adult . In the future , transduction protocols should aim to provide physiological transgene expression with as few integra - tions of vector per cell as possible . In the case of WAS , it is important to ensure hematopoietic speciﬁcity of transgene expression pattern . Vectors using ubiquitous promoters such as PGK enable WASP transgene expres - sion in nonhematopoietic cells ( not shown ) and could be envisioned for ex vivo transduction protocols , since transgene expression would be limited to the hemato - poietic system derived from the transplanted cells . Hematopoietic - speciﬁc expression may be obtained using promoter regions of the WASP gene , 28 , 29 which should be assessed in lentiviral vector conﬁguration . The present results constitute baseline data for the improve - ment of vectors and transduction protocols in WAS . While more studies remain to be carried out , our results indicate that lentiviral vectors are promising tools for the gene therapy of WAS . Materials and methods Animals and cell lines Mice were kept at Institut Gustave Roussy Animal Facility , Villejuif , France , in agreement with local and national guidelines . WKO mice were kindly provided by Dr Snapper ( Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , MA , USA ) and bred in our facility under pathogen - free conditions . Wild - type 129 Sv / Ev mice were purchased from Iffa Credo ( L’arbresle , France ) and quarantined for at least 7 days prior to use . Recipient female WKO mice were irradiated in ventilated plexiglas containers using an X - ray source at a dose rate of 0 . 43 Gy / min . Total body irradiation was given as a single exposure of 9 . 5 Gy , 2 – 3 h before cell transplantation . The 293Tcells , kindly provided by Dr L Naldini ( Tiget , Milan ) and HCT116 , obtained from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) ( Hyclone , Logan , UT , USA ) , penicillin / streptomycin ( PS ) and 2 m M L - glutamine ( L - Glu ) ( Gibco BRL / Invitrogen , Cergy Pontoise , France ) . Preparation of genomic DNA , mRNA and cDNA Genomic DNA was extracted from cell lines using the ‘Wizard genomic DNA puriﬁcation kit’ ( Promega Cor - poration , Madison , WI , USA ) and from murine periph - eral blood cells using ‘High pure PCR Template preparation kit’ ( Roche Applied Sciences , Penzberd , Germany ) . Total RNA was extracted using SV total RNA isolation system ( Promega ) . In all , 1 m g of each total RNA sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA with the Super - Script II RT ( GIBCO BRL ) using random hexamer primers at 42 1 C for 50 min . The RT was inactivated by incubation for 15 min at 70 1 C . Quantitative real - time PCR The technique , described elsewhere 30 employed oligo - nucleotide primers and Taq Man probes ( Table 1 ) de - signed with Primer Express and Oligo 4 . 0 Primer Analysis software ( Perkin - Elmer Applied Biosystem ) and an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector ( Perkin - Elmer Applied Biosystems , Norwalk , CT , USA ) . Taq Man probes consisted of oligonucleotides with a 5 0 reporter dye ( 6 - carboxyﬂuorescein ) and a downstream 3 0 quencher dye ( 6 - carboxytetramethyl rhodamine ) . Vector titration and measures of vector integration in human cells used SybrGreen to detect ampliﬁed PCR products . Ampliﬁca - tion reactions ( 17 m l ) contained 8 m l of sample cDNA or genomic DNA and 9 m l of Taq Man buffer ( Taq Man Universal PCR Master Mix , No AmpErase UNG , Applied Biosystems ) , 0 . 2 m M primers ( forward and reverse ) , and 0 . 1 m M Taq Man probe and consisted of 40 cycles at 95 1 C ( 15 s ) then 60 1 C ( 1 min ) . Standard ampliﬁcation curves were obtained by serial dilutions of DNA containing appropriate sequences . All measures were performed at least in duplicate . Data were edited using the Primer Express software . Generation and titration of lentiviruses The self - inactivating HIV - 1 - derived vector HIV - PGK - huWASP - WPRE was generated from the previously described pRRL - cPPT - hPGK - EGFP - WPRE vector 20 by replacing EGFP with human WASP coding sequence cDNA ( Genebank Accession number NM _ 000377 ) . VSV - G - pseudotyped vectors were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells . Culture medium was collected at 24 , 48 and 72 h , pooled , concentrated approximately 500 - fold by ultracentrifugation , aliquoted and stored at (cid:2) 80 1 C until used . Vector titers were determined by quantitative PCR on genomic DNA of infected cells . Brieﬂy , HCT116 cells were infected with serial dilutions of vector stock , washed and 4 days later , vector proviral genome in the transduced cells was ampliﬁed using PCR with the SybrGreen Jumpstart Taq ready mix ( Sigma Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA ) . Proviral sequences were ampliﬁed at the LTR RU5 boundary and normalized to the human albumin gene ( hALB ) intron 12 , using primers described in Table 1 . Standard curves with known amounts of DNA ( quantiﬁed by optical density ) from plasmids pRRL - SINcPPT - PGK - EGFP - WPRE ( 7384 bp ) and pMOI - ALB ( 6379 bp ) were used to quantify numbers of LTR and ALB molecules present in each sample . The number of VGs per transduced cell was determined after normalization of LTR with hALB assuming two alleles hALB per cell and two LTR per integration . Titers in VG / ml were calculated as : normal - ized VG value (cid:1) nb infected cells / vol vector ( ml ) . Preparation , transduction and transplantation of progenitor cells Lin (cid:2) cells were puriﬁed from wild - type or WKO BM , using magnetic bead cell sorting ( Dynal , Compie ` gne , France ) to remove cells staining with CD45R / B220 ( clone RA3 - 6B2 ) , CD3 ( clone KT3 . 1 ) , Ly - 6 / GR1 ( clone RB6 - 8C5 ) , CD11 / Mac - 1 ( clone M1 / 70 ) and TER 119 monoclonal A lentiviral vector for the gene therapy of Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome S Charrier et al 603 Gene Therapy antibodies ( Mabs ) ( kind gift from S Szilvassy , SySTEMix and Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA ) . Lin (cid:2) cells were preactivated by culture in X - Vivo 20 medium ( BioWhit - taker , Walkersville , NJ , USA ) supplemented with 2 % FCS , L - Glu , PS and murine interleukin 3 ( IL - 3 ) ( 10 ng / ml ) , human thrombopoietin ( TPO ) ( 25 ng / ml ) , human Flt - 3 ligand ( 50 ng / ml ) and murine stem cell factor ( 50 ng / ml ) , at 37 1 C , 5 % CO 2 for 2 days . WKO cells ( 0 . 5 – 1 (cid:1) 10 6 cells / ml ) were transduced with 1 (cid:1) 10 7 or 1 (cid:1) 10 8 VG / ml of HIV - PGK - WASP - WPRE vector ( MOI equivalent to 10 or 100 ) in the presence of polybrene ( 4 m g / ml ) and cytokines , for 3 h . Fresh medium was added and cells were washed once more , 24 h after transduction . At 2 days postinfection , transduction efﬁciency was evaluated by quantitative real - time PCR and transduced progenitor cells ( 500 000 cells / mouse ) were injected intravenously into lethally irradiated female WKO mice . After 3 months , donor chimerism in blood was tested by quantitative real - time PCR using detection of Y chromosome sequences normalized to mouse TTN gene ( Table 3 ) . Percentages of Y - chimerism were calculated by reference to titration curves consist - ing of varying proportions of male and female blood cells . The average number of vector integrations per donor cell was calculated by quantitative PCR using detection of WPRE sequences normalized to mouse TTN gene ( Table 3 ) based on dilutions of a plasmid containing WPRE and mouse TTN and corrected for percentages of donor cells using Y - chimerism data . At 5 months post - transplant , mice were killed by cervical dislocation to remove the BM , spleen , thymus and colon . Splenic and thymic cells suspension were obtained by passing the disrupted tissue through a 40 - m m ﬁlter in a MEM medium supplemented with 10 % FCS , L - Glu , PS and 50 m M b - mercaptoethanol . Immunoﬂuorescence staining and Western blot analysis Thymocytes placed in PBS buffer containing 1 % BSA and 0 . 05 % NaN 3 were incubated with APC - conjugated anti - CD8 , PE - conjugated anti - CD3 and Cy - Chrome - conjugated anti - CD4 antibodies ( Pharmingen , San Diego , CA , USA ) for 30 min at 4 1 C . Stained cells were analyzed using a FACScan t with CELLQuest t software ( Becton Dickinson ) . For Western blotting , splenocytes were lysed for 10 min in buffer containing 50 m M Tris – HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 200 m M NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 5 % sodium deox - ycholate , 10 % glycerol , 1 m M EDTA , 1 m M PMSF ( phe - nylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride , Sigma ) and a protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) containing 10 m g / ml each of leupeptin , pepstatin and aprotinin . Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation ( 15 000 rpm / min ) and lysates were boiled in the presence of 5 (cid:1) Laemmli buffer . Proteins ( 30 m g per lane ) were separated by 10 % SDS – PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Hybond ECL , Amersham ) , blotted with WASP - speciﬁc antibodies ( D1 clone ( detecting human WASP ) or H250 clone ( detecting mouse and human WASP and slightly cross - reactive with mouse N - WASP ) , Santa Cruz ) or anti - b - actin antibody ( Sigma ) and detected with ECL Western blotting detection kit ( Amersham ) and Kodak Biomax ﬁlm . T - cell proliferation assay Splenocytes ( 2 (cid:1) 10 5 cells / well in 200 m l volume ) were stimulated in triplicate for 3 days with anti - CD3 e antibody ( 12 m g / ml , Pharmingen ) coated onto 96 - well ﬂat - bottomed microtiter plates . Cultures were pulsed with [ methyl - 3 Hthymidine ( 1 m Ci / well , 0 . 037 MBq ) for the last 16 h . Incorporated radioactivity was measured on a scintillation counter .

Cells were incubated onto ﬁbronectin for 2 h at 37 1 C , ﬁxed in 2 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , washed with PBS and permeabilized using Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 2 % ) for 4 min . Podosomes were detected by staining vinculin ( 1 : 400 , Sigma ) detected with Alexa 488 goat anti - mouse ( 1 : 1000 , Molecular Probes ) and ﬁlamentous actin ( tetramethylrhodamine – phalloidin , 1 : 1000 ) . The nuclei were labeled with DAPI in anti - fading mounting medium ( Fluoromount G ) . Cells were examined by confocal microscopy using the Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser scanning microscope . Imaging was performed with a (cid:1) 40 oil - immersion objective using the laser wave - lengths 488 nm ( argon ) , 543 nm ( HeNe ) excitation and 405 nm ( Diode laser ) . All images represent a single section through the focal plane . Images were processed with Leica TCS Start and Adobe Photoshop software . Percent cells displaying podosomes were counted by enumerating at least 100 cells . Histology Colonic samples were ﬁxed in 10 % formalin . Tissue sections ( 10 m m ) were embedded in parafﬁn and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic examination . Leukocyte inﬂammation was scored as + ¼ minimal , + + ¼ intermediate and + + + ¼ massive with disorganized architecture . Mucosal dedifferentiation was scored from 0 ¼ none , + ¼ rare focal , + + ¼ intermediate and + + + ¼ severe . Slides were read by two investigators ( AG , PO ) , one ( PO ) performing a blinded analysis . Acknowledgements We are grateful to Dr S Snapper , Harvard Medical School for the gift of WKO mice .
