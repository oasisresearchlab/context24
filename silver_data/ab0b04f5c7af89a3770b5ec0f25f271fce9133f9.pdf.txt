One - Sentence Summary : The enzyme PIP4K functions as both a sensor and negative regulator of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis by the closely related PIP5K enzymes , tuning the activity of numerous membrane functions . Abstract : The lipid molecule phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) controls all aspects of plasma membrane ( PM ) function in animal cells , from its selective permeability to the attachment of the cytoskeleton . Although disruption of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is associated with a wide range of diseases , it remains unclear how cells sense and maintain PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels to support various cell functions . Here , we show that the PIP4K family of enzymes that synthesize PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 via a minor pathway , also function as sensors of tonic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . PIP4Ks are recruited to the PM by elevated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , where they inhibit the major PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - synthesizing PIP5Ks . Perturbation of this simple homeostatic mechanism reveals differential sensitivity of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent signaling to elevated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . These findings reveal that a subset of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - driven functions may drive disease associated with disrupted PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis . 2 Introduction The lipid molecule PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a master regulator of animal cell plasma membranes ( PMs ) . By recruiting or activating scores of membrane proteins , it controls transport of ions and solutes across the membrane [ 1 , 2 ] , attaches the underlying cytoskeleton [ 3 ] , regulates the traffic of proteinaceous cargo to and from the membrane [ 4 ] , disseminates extracellular signals [ 2 ] , and facilitates the entry , assembly and egress of bacterial and viral pathogens [ 2 , 5 ] . As a result , synthesis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is essential for life in mammals [ 6 , 7 ] . Nonetheless , genetic defects occur in humans that either increase or decrease PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , disrupting cellular physiology in unpredictable ways . These manifest in diseases ranging from cancer [ 8 ] to kidney disease [ 9 ] to dysentery [ 10 ] . Clearly , there is a central physiological imperative to tightly control PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels for harmonious PM function . A detailed homeostatic mechanism that can sense and maintain PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels has , however , proven elusive . Most prior work in this area has focused on positive regulation of phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinases ( PIP5Ks ) , the major enzymes responsible for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis ( fig . 1A ) . These enzymes add a phosphate to the 5 - OH of their substrate , PI4P [ 11 – 13 ] . Such positive regulation can be mediated by the small GTPases Arf6 [ 12 , 13 ] and Rac [ 14 , 15 ] or the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 metabolite phosphatidic acid [ 16 ] . In fact , PIP5Ks cooperatively bind to their product , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which creates a positive feedback loop that enhances membrane localization and catalytic output [ 17 ] . However , we reasoned that maintaining tonic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in the PM in the presence of abundant PI4P substrate [ 18 , 19 ] would demand negative feedback of PIP5Ks . This is especially apparent during lipid re - synthesis after phospholipase C ( PLC ) activation ; PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels plateau despite the fact that levels of the precursor lipid PI4P are still rising [ 20 – 22 ] . Potential mechanisms of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 downregulation include PIP5K autophosphorylation [ 23 ] , as well as a futile cycle wherein PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 lipids are dephosphorylated back to PI4P by inositol polyphosphate 5 - phosphatase ( INPP5 ) enzymes [ 24 ] , although the specific INPP5 family member ( s ) responsible for this constitutive activity have not been defined . Finally , PIP5K inhibition by the related phosphatidylinositol 5 - phosphate 4 - kinases ( PIP4Ks ) , which produce PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from much less abundant PI5P substrate , has been reported [ 25 ] . However , how this downregulation of PIP5K activity by the PIP4Ks is regulated to maintain PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis has not been defined . 3 A common feature missing from effectors that downregulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis is the identity of sensors that detect changing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and modulate these effectors appropriately . Without knowledge of such a mechanism , how cells accomplish effective PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis and thereby maintain harmonious PM function has been a mystery . In this paper , we demonstrate that the PIP4K family of enzymes act as low affinity PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sensors , monitoring tonic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and constraining PIP5K activity when levels of the lipid rise too high . Modulation of this homeostatic mechanism reveal unprecedented differences in the sensitivity of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent signaling to resting PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . Results PIP5Ks are inhibited by PIP4Ks This study was motivated by some initially perplexing results we obtained when monitoring PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels with the low - affinity biosensor , Tubby cR332H [ 26 ] , together with PI4P levels using the high - affinity biosensor , P4Mx2 [ 19 ] : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are expected to increase at the expense of PM PI4P levels when over - expressing any of the three paralogs of human PIP5K ( A - C ) or the single homolog from the budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Mss4 ) . Indeed , this was precisely what we observed ( fig . 1A and B , statistics reported in tables 1 and 2 ) . What perplexed us was that catalytic activity of the human enzymes is dispensable for increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( fig . 1A ) and depleted PM PI4P ( fig . 1B ) . Catalytic activity is essential for yeast PIP5K , however ( fig . 1A and B ) . Notably , expression of the catalytically inactive mutants was usually somewhat less strong compared to the wild - type enzymes , yet effects on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels were similar ( fig . 1A ) . Conversely , over - expression of PIP4K enzymes , which also make PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 but from PI5P substrate , would be expected to elevate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels slightly . Yet , we found that PIP4K2A and PIP4K2B actually decreased PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , with a ranked order PIP4K2A > PIP4K2B > PIP4K2C ( fig . 1C , statistics in table 3 ) . For PIP4K2A at least , this occurred even when expressing a catalytically inactive mutant . Again , differences in expression level between paralogs do not explain differences in activity , since all achieved comparable expression levels as assessed by fluorescence intensity ( fig . 1C ) . These observations were consistent with a prior report that knocking out PIP4K paralogs elevates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels [ 25 ] , because PIP4K enzymes can inhibit PIP5Ks independently of their catalytic activity . We therefore reasoned that 4 saturation of endogenous , inhibitory PIP4K molecules by PIP5K over - expression , regardless of catalytic activity of the PIP5K , would free endogenous , active PIP5K enzyme from negative regulation ( fig . 1D ) . To directly test for negative regulation of PIP5K activity by PIP4K in cells , we wanted to assay PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels after acute membrane recruitment of normally cytosolic PIP4K paralogs . To this end , we triggered rapid PM recruitment of cytosolic , FKBP - tagged PIP4K by chemically induced dimerization ( CID ) with a membrane targeted FRB domain , using rapamycin [ 27 ] . As shown in fig . 2A , all three paralogs of PIP4K induce a steady decline in PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels within minutes of PM recruitment . Catalytically inactive mutants of all three paralogs produce identical responses ( fig . 2A ) . We also reasoned that co - expression of PIP4K paralogs with PIP5K might attenuate the elevated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels induced by the latter . Broadly speaking , this was true , but with some curious paralog selectivity ( fig . 2B , statistics reported in table 4 ) : PIP4K2A and PIP4K2B both attenuated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 elevated by PIP5K1A and B , but not ( or much less so ) PIP5K1C ; PIP4K2C , on the other hand , attenuated PIP5K1A and was the only paralog to significantly attenuate PIP5K1C’s effect , yet it did not attenuate PIP5K1B at all . To more directly examine inhibition of PIP5K by PIP4K , we tested activity of purified PIP5K1A on PI4P - containing supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ) . Addition of PIP4K2A exhibited delayed inhibition of PIP5K1A activity ( fig . 2C ) : Once PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reached approximately 28 , 000 lipids / µm 2 ( ~ 2 mol % ) , PIP5K dependent lipid phosphorylation slowed down , which doubled the reaction completion time ( fig . 2C , right ) . In contrast , we observed no PIP4K dependent inhibition of Mss4 ( fig . 2C , inset ) . These data recapitulate the prior finding that PIP4K only inhibited purified PIP5K in the presence of bilayer - presented substrate [ 25 ] . We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of PIP5K by PIP4K requires recruitment of the latter enzyme to the PM by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 itself . PIP4Ks are low affinity sensors of PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 To probe the interaction of endogenous PIP4Ks with PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , we used a split fluorescent protein genome editing approach [ 28 ] to add a NeonGreen2 ( NG2 ) tag to each of the three PIP4K paralogs ( fig . 3A ) . Successful integration of the split NG2 tag was evident at the genomic level ( fig . 3B ) ; a minor shift in protein size was also observed at the protein level after addition 5 of the neonGreen 11 tag to PIP4K2C ( fig . 3B ) . As expected , endogenous PIP4Ks have a mainly cytosolic distribution when viewed in confocal , with a slight enrichment at the cell periphery ( fig . 3C ) , which is consistent with results from the OpenCell project [ 29 ] . Analysis of the ventral PM by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) revealed individual , diffraction - limited and uniform intensity puncta that were dynamically associated with the membrane ( fig . 3D ) . We compared the intensity of these puncta with a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor tagged with single , double or triple mNeonGreen copies expressed at single molecule levels . This revealed that the NG2 - PIP4K2C puncta contained an average of 1 . 87 NG2 molecules , whereas NG2 - PIP4K2A puncta contained 1 . 40 and NG2 - PIP4K2B contained 1 . 33 NG2 molecules . This is consistent with dimeric PIP4K complexes [ 30 ] mature copies of the NG2 fluorescent protein and displaying lower fluorescence due to heterodimerization with unlabeled endogenous PIP4Ks ( fig . 3E ) . Analysis of the average fluorescence intensity of confocal sections of the edited cells recapitulates the ranked expression order of the PIP4Ks in HEK293 cells by proteomic studies [ 29 , 31 ] , with PIP4K2C > > PIP4K2A > PIP4K2B ( fig . 3F ) . Satisfyingly , the total intensity of the cells scale linearly with the photon count of single NG2 - containing complexes resolved as puncta ( fig . 3F ) ; this is expected , since PIP4K paralogs exist as a series of randomly associated homo - and hetero dimers of the three paralogs [ 32 ] . Therefore , NG2 - PIP4K2C dimers are expected to be more frequent since there is more total PIP4K2C expression in HEK293 and thus a higher probability of homodimerization between molecules of this paralog . Given the dynamic interaction of all three PIP4K paralogs with the PM , we next asked the question : does this interaction depend on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ? On supported lipid bilayers , purified PIP4K2A was released from the membrane upon depletion of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by the addition of the 5 - OH phosphatase , OCRL ( fig . 4A ) , mirroring the kinetics of the PH - PLC δ 1 lipid biosensor . To determine if this also holds true with native proteins in living cells , we employed CID to recruit the INPP5E 5 - OH phosphatase to rapidly deplete PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 27 ] . As shown in figs . 4C - E , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion was evident from the rapid loss of a high - affinity biosensor , Tubby c [ 26 ] . This depletion was accompanied by loss of PM localized molecules of all three NG2 - PIP4K paralogs , PIP4K2A ( fig . 4C ) , PIP4K2B ( fig . 4D ) and PIP4K2C ( fig . 4E ) when viewed by TIRFM . Therefore , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is necessary to drive PIP4K association with the membrane . 6 Despite this clear PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding , a relatively small fraction of PIP4K2C is present on the PM at steady state ( see confocal images in fig . 3C ) . Given that there are many orders of magnitude more PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules in the PM than PIP4K in the cell [ 33 ] , these observations suggest that PIP4Ks bind the lipid with low affinity . Indeed , PIP4K2A binding to supported lipid bilayers was barely evident at 1 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , but detectable at 2 % and rose sharply at 3 and 4 % ( fig , 5A ) . This is suggestive of a highly co - operative binding mode , as might be expected from a dimeric protein . Notably , binding was not saturated at these low lipid mole fractions , which are thought to be physiological [ 33 ] . We therefore reasoned that elevating PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels may actually increase endogenous PIP4K association with the PM . To this end , we employed over - expression of Mss4 , since this enzyme does not bind to PIP4Ks ( fig . 2C ) and enhances PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a manner that depends on catalytic activity ( fig . 1A ) . Over - expression of Mss4 indeed enhanced membrane binding of all three PIP4K paralogs in a manner dependent on catalytic activity ( fig . 5B , statistics reported in table 5 ) . On PI4P - containing supported lipid bilayers , the addition of active Mss4 induced PIP4K2A binding to the lipid bilayer , again with evidence of co - operativity and a threshold of around 2 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( fig . 5C ) . We next tested for rapid binding to acutely increasing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in living cells , using CID of a homodimeric mutant PIP5K domain ( PIP5K - HD ) , which can only dimerize with itself and not endogenous PIP5K paralogs [ 34 ] . This domain also lacks two basic residues that are crucial for membrane binding [ 35 ] , and only elevates PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 when it retains catalytic activity ( fig . 5D ) , unlike the full - length protein ( fig . 1A ) . Recruitment of the active mutant PIP5K domain acutely elevated NG2 - PIP4K2C membrane association with identical kinetics to the Tubby cR332H PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reporter , whereas the catalytically inactive mutant was without effect ( fig . 5D ) . These data indicate that PIP4K2C binds PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with relatively low affinity . As an additional test of this in live cells , we assessed the kinetics of PM binding during PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 re - synthesis after strong PLC activation . Stimulation of over - expressed PLC - coupled muscarinic M3 receptors induced rapid depletion of both NG2 - PIP4K2C and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( measured with Tubby c , fig . 6A ) . Subsequent induction of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 re - synthesis with the muscarinic antagonist atropine revealed much slower rebinding of NG2 - PIP4K2C to the PM compared to the Tubby c PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor ; PIP4K2C takes more than twice as long ( fig . 6B ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that PIP4Ks are low - affinity PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 effectors , poised to sense both decreases and crucially , elevations in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in the PM . Combined with the 7 previously identified inhibition of PIP5K activity by PIP4K ( [ 25 ] and fig . 2 ) , this suggests a mechanism where PIP4K can act as both receptor and control center for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis , with PIP5K as the effector : when PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels rise due to PIP5K activity , PIP4K is recruited to the PM , where it can directly bind and inhibit PIP5K . However , such a mechanism suggests a direct interaction of PIP5K and PIP4K . It is to this question that we turn our attention next . PIP4K directly interacts with PIP5K Previous evidence in the literature points to direct interactions between PIP5Ks and PIP4Ks . Over - expressed PIP4K2A is able to co - immunoprecipitate different PIP5K paralogs [ 36 ] , and epitope - tagged PIP5K1A was able to pull - down PIP4K2A when expressed at close to endogenous levels [ 25 ] . When co - expressing EGFP - tagged PIP5Ks and TagBFP2 - tagged PIP4K2s , we found that PIP5K paralogs’ PM binding is largely unaffected by PIP4K over - expression ( fig . 7A , upper panel and table 6 ) , whereas all three paralogs of PIP4K are strongly recruited to the PM by co - expression of any PIP5K ( fig . 7A , lower panel and table 7 ) , as previously observed for PIP4K2A [ 36 ] . While these data are consistent with a direct interaction between PIP4Ks and PIP5Ks , another possibility exists : the PIP5K dependent increase in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( fig . 1A ) enhances PM recruitment of PIP4K ( figs . 4 - 6 ) . Prior pull - downs of PIP5K and PIP4K from lysates required cross - linking the proteins , which may have occurred when the enzymes were simply co - localized on the PM rather than directly interacting [ 25 ] . We therefore sought to distinguish between a direct PIP5K - PIP4K binding interaction versus PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - induced co - enrichment on the PM . To this end , we devised an experiment whereby a bait protein ( either PIP5K or control proteins ) could be acutely localized to subdomains of the PM , with the same PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration . This was achieved using CID of baits with an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) tethered protein , causing restricted localization of the bait protein to ER - PM contact sites – a subdomain of the PM ( fig . 7B ) . Enrichment of endogenous NG2 - PIP4K2C at ER - PM contact sites was only observed when PIP5K1A was the bait ; an unrelated peptide ( myristoylated and palmitoylated peptide from Lyn kinase , Lyn 11 ) or Mss4 did not enrich NG2 - PIP4K2C ( fig . 7B ) . The use of Mss4 ruled out an effect of enhanced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation at contact sites , since this enzyme increases PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as potently as PIP5K1A ( fig . 1A ) , yet does not cause recruitment of PIP4K2C . 8 Finally , we also demonstrate that PIP4K2A binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing supported lipid bilayers was greatly enhanced by addition of PIP5K to the membranes ( fig . 7C ) , but not by Mss4 ( fig . 7D ) . Clearly , PIP4K enzymes directly interact with PIP5Ks on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing lipid bilayers . The ability of PIP4K to bind to PIP5K on a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing bilayer also potentially explains the slightly accelerated initial rate of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis exhibited by PIP5K1A that we reported in fig . 2C , since PIP4K may initially introduce some avidity to the membrane interaction by PIP5K , before PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reaches a sufficient concentration that PIP4K - mediated inhibition is effective . Disruption of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has differential effects on signaling Synthesizing all of these observations , we propose a simple homeostatic feedback loop that maintains PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in the PM ( fig . 8A ) : when PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels increase , PIP4K is recruited to the PM in sufficient quantities to inhibit PIP5K , halting further PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis . If PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels fall , PIP4K is one of the first PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding proteins to be released ( due to its low affinity ) , causing disinhibition of PIP5K and recovery of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . We next sought to test how perturbations of this homeostat would affect physiological function . We could produce graded changes in resting PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels by over - expression of various components of the homeostat : enhanced PIP5K1A expression , either catalytically active or inactive , increases PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ; a myristoylated PIP4K2A retains PM localization even at low PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , causing sustained reductions in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ; and a PM - localized PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - OH phosphatase causes near complete ablation of the lipid . These constructs all show the expected changes in PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 compared to a control , reported by three different PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensors . Of these , Tubby c showed the largest degree of change in PM localization across all changes in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( fig . 8B ) . We then used these graded changes in steady - state PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to investigate the concentration requirements for the lipid in signaling . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the substrate for PLC , the enzyme that cleaves it into second messengers diacylglycerol and inositol ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) , triggering calcium release from ER stores ( fig . 8C ) . Calcium release was indeed reduced by lower PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , but appeared to be maximal at tonic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ; it was unaffected by increased PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . This was true for both peak calcium release and total release from stores ( assessed by measuring activity in calcium - free medium , fig . 8C ) . Influx of extracellular calcium was increased by elevated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( fig . 8C ) , consistent with a prior report that store - operated calcium entry is 9 enhanced by increased PIP5K activity [ 13 ] . However , IP 3 - triggered calcium release appears saturated at resting PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . This strongly contrasts with the effects on another PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 signaling pathway , class I phosphoinositide 3 - OH kinase ( PI3K ) . Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor stimulation activates PI3K , which converts a small fraction of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PIP 3 ( fig . 8D ) . Using a sensitive PIP 3 biosensor , we observed PIP 3 production changing proportionately with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , never reaching a saturated level ( fig . 8D ) . PI3K activation therefore , unlike PLC , is sensitive to upregulation by alterations in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis that enhance steady - state levels of the lipid , e . g . by enhanced PIP5K1A expression . Discussion The work presented herein reveals a remarkably simple homeostatic mechanism for PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( fig . 8A ) . Here , the PIP4K family of enzymes serve as both receptor and control center , detecting PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and controlling the activity of the effector , PIP5K . This mechanism is also complementary to a previously identified homeostatic feedback , whereby PI4P catabolism is inactivated in cells until sufficient PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has been generated [ 37 ] . By these mechanisms , cells can ensure adequate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is generated to support the cytoskeletal assembly , small solute transport , ion flux , membrane traffic and cell signaling processes controlled by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . PIP4K’s low affinity and highly co - operative binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 makes it an excellent sensor for tonic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . It is poised to sense PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generated in excess of the needs of the lipids’ legion effector proteins , ensuring these needs are met but not exceeded . Nevertheless , the relatively low PIP4K copy number of around 2 . 5 x 10 5 per cell [ 29 ] is a small fraction of the total PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pool , estimated to be ~ 10 7 [ 33 ] , ensuring little impact on the capacity of the lipid to interact with its effectors . Since this paper was initially submitted for publication , another study has reported a similar homeostatic feedback loop in Drosophila photoreceptors , utilizing the fly homologue of septin 7 as the receptor and control center [ 38 ] . This conclusion is based on the observation that cells with reduced septin 7 levels have enhanced PIP5K activity in lysates , and exhibit more rapid PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 resynthesis after PLC activation . However , changes in septin 7 membrane localization in response to acute alterations in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , as well as direct interactions between PIP5K and septin 7 , have yet to be demonstrated . Nevertheless , septin 7 has distinct properties as a potential homeostatic mediator ; as a foundational member of the septin family , it is essential for generating all major types of septin filament [ 39 ] . Therefore , a null allele for this subunit is 10 expected to reduce the prevalence of the septin cytoskeleton by half . Given that septin subunits are found in mammalian cells at high copy number , around ~ 10 6 each [ 29 ] , and the fact that septins bind PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 40 , 41 ] , it is likely that septin filaments sequester a significant fraction of the PM PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through high - avidity interactions . In addition , membrane - bound septins appear to be effective diffusion barriers to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and other lipids [ 42 ] . We therefore speculate that septins may play a unique role in systems such as the fly photoreceptor with extremely high levels of PLC - mediated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 turnover : The septin cytoskeleton can act as a significant buffer for PI4P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in such systems , as well as corralling pools of the lipids for use at the rhabdomeres were the high rate of turnover occurs . This is in contrast to the role played by the PIP4Ks , where PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels are held in a narrow range under conditions of more limited turnover , as found in most cells . That PIP4K has such a crucial function for which catalytic activity is entirely dispensable is surprising . PIP4K catalytic activity varies among paralogs by almost four orders of magnitude [ 43 ] ; nevertheless , the ability of the enzymes to phosphorylate PI5P is known to be crucial for many of its other physiological functions [ 44 , 45 ] . However , the low affinity PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding that we describe , and its inhibition of PIP5K described previously [ 25 ] , explain why PIP4Ks are expressed in cells in excess of PIP5K by as much as 10 : 1 [ 29 , 31 ] . This fact does not make sense relative to the enzymes’ catalytic activity , given that PIP4Ks’ substrate , PI5P , is outnumbered by PI4P by around 100 - fold [ 46 ] . Curiously , although phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases are found throughout eukarya , PIP4Ks are limited to holozoa ( animals and closely related unicellular organisms ) [ 47 ] . Indeed , we found the PIP5K from the fission yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , does not interact with human PIP4Ks ( fig . 7 ) and cannot modulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in human cells without its catalytic activity ( fig . 1 ) . This begs the question : how do S . cerevisiae regulate their own PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ? Intriguingly , they seem to have a paralogous homeostatic mechanism : the dual PH domain containing protein Opy1 serves as receptor and control center [ 48 ] , in an analogous role to PIP4K . Since there is no mammalian homolog of Opy1 , this homeostatic mechanism appears to have appeared at least twice through convergent evolution . Combined with hints of a role for septins in maintaining PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels [ 38 ] , the possibility arises that there may yet be more feedback controls of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels to be discovered . 11 Despite minor differences in the ability of over - expressed PIP5K paralogs to recruit over - expressed PIP4K enzymes ( fig . 7A ) , we observed major differences in the ability of PIP4K paralogs to inhibit PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis when over - expressed alone ( fig . 1C ) or in combination with PIP5K ( fig . 2B ) . It is unclear what drives the partially overlapping inhibitory activity , where each PIP5K paralog can be attenuated by 2 or 3 PIP4Ks . This is however reminiscent of the biology of the PIPKs , where there is a high degree of redundancy among them , with few unique physiological functions assigned to specific paralogs [ 49 ] . There may be hints of paralog - specific functions in our data ; for example , enhanced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 induced by over - expressed PIP5K1C is only really attenuated by PIP4K2C ( fig . 2B ) . This could imply a requirement for PIP4K2C in regulating PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels during PLC - mediated signaling , given the unique requirements for PIP5K1C in this process [ 50 , 51 ] . Regardless , a full understanding of paralog selectivity will need to be driven by a detailed structural analysis of the interaction between PIP4Ks and PIP5Ks - which is not immediately apparent from their known crystal structures , especially since PIP4Ks and PIP5Ks employ separate and distinct dimerization interfaces [ 49 ] . The apparently linear dependence of PI3K on available PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 that we revealed after modulating PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis ( fig . 8 ) explains enhanced PI3K signaling reported in PIP4K - null cells [ 25 , 52 ] . Intriguingly , PIP4Ks were reported to inhibit PI3K / Akt signaling two decades ago , but the mechanism was proposed to be through removal of its PI5P substrate , which was thought to somehow enhance accumulation of PI3K lipid products , PIP 3 and PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 [ 53 ] . The key evidence that it was PI5P that caused the PI3K lipid accumulation came from the observation that it could be recapitulated by the Shigella flexneri effector protein IpgD , which generates some PI5P from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ; this and the analogous Salmonella effector SopB both activate the PI3K / Akt pathway [ 53 – 55 ] . However , it was recently shown that both SopB and IpgD are in fact novel phosphotransferases that directly convert PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 into the PI3K signaling lipid PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , explaining how these enzymes activate Akt [ 56 ] . It therefore seems more likely that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 downregulation is the most likely explanation for PI3K / Akt pathway inhibition by PIP4Ks . In conclusion , our results reveal a simple yet elegant homeostatic mechanism that controls PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( fig . 8A ) . Perturbation of this homeostasis reveals different sensitivities of PLC and PI3K signaling , with the latter showing enhanced activation with elevated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . This likely explains why the PI3K , and not the PLC pathway , drives the phenotype of PIP4K - null fruit 12 flies [ 52 ] . More broadly , such differences in the sensitivity of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent PM functions to lipid concentration may go a long way in explaining the phenotypic diversity of diseases associated with dysregulated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 metabolism . For example , they may explain why a selective inhibitor of PI3K α can correct aberrant kidney function associated with Lowe syndrome models [ 9 ] . Indeed , experimental manipulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis will now afford the ability to determine which of the panoply of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - dependent PM functions are dysregulated by pathological alterations – perhaps bringing novel therapeutic targets into view . 13 Materials and Methods Cell culture and lipofection HeLa ( ATCC CCL - 2 ) and HEK293A ( ThermoFisher R705 - 07 ) cells were cultured in DMEM ( low glucose ; Life Technologies 10567022 ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Life Technologies 10438 - 034 ) , 100 units / ml penicillin , 100µg / ml streptomycin ( Life Technologies 15140122 ) , and 1 : 1 , 000 chemically defined lipid supplement ( Life Technologies 11905031 ) at 37˚C with a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 .

BACMIDs and baculovirus were generated as previously described [ 17 ] . ES - Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus using an optimized multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) , typically 2 % vol / vol , that was empirically determined from small - scale test expression . Infected cells were typically grown for 48 hours at 27ºC in ESF 921 Serum - Free Insect Cell Culture medium ( Expression Systems , Cat # 96 - 001 - 01 ) and then harvested by centrifugation . Insect cell pellets were then washed with 1x PBS [ pH 7 . 2 ] and centrifuged ( 3500 rpm for 10 minutes ) . The final cell pellet was combined with an equal volume of buffer containing 1x PBS [ pH 7 . 2 ] , 10 % glycerol , and 2x Sigma protease inhibitor cocktail tablet solution before transferring to the - 80ºC freezer for storage .

High speed supernatant was combined with 6 mL of Ni - NTA Agarose ( Qiagen , Cat # 30230 ) and stirred in a beaker for 1 - 2 hour ( s ) at 4ºC . Following batch binding , resin was collected in 50 mL tubes , centrifuged , and washed with buffer containing 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 10 mM imidazole , 400 mM NaCl , and 5 mM BME . Ni - NTA resin with His6 - MBP - ( Asn ) 10 - TEV - ( Gly ) 5 - PIP5KA bound was washed in a gravity flow column with 100 mL of 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 30 mM imidazole , 400 mM NaCl , 5 % glycerol , and 5 mM BME buffer .

Proteins were resolved over a 10 - 100 % linear gradient ( 0 . 1 - 1 M NaCl , 45 CV , 45 mL total , 1 mL / min flow rate ) . ( Gly ) x5 - PIP5K1A and ( Gly ) x5 - Mss4 eluted from the MonoS in the presence of 375 - 450 mM NaCl . Peak fractions containing PIP5K1A were pooled , concentrated in a 30 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 6 centrifuge tube ( GE Healthcare , Cat # 28 - 9323 - 17 ) , and loaded onto a 24 mL Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL ( GE Healthcare , Cat # 17 - 5174 - 01 ) size exclusion column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 200 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM TCEP . Peak fractions were concentrated to 10 - 50 µM using a 30 kDa MWCO Amicon centrifuge tube ( Millipore Sigma ) before snap freezing with liquid nitrogen . PIP5K1A and Mss4 were stored in - 80ºC as single use aliquots . 16 Purification of PIP4K2A The gene encoding human PIP4K2A was cloned into a pETM derived bacterial expression vector to create the following fusion protein : His6 - SUMO3 - ( Gly ) 5 - PIP4K2A ( 1 - 406aa ) . Recombinant PIP4KA was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) Star E . coli ( i . e . lack endonuclease for increased mRNA stability ) . Using 4 liters of Terrific Broth , bacterial cultures were grown at 37ºC until OD 600 = 0 . 6 . Cultures were then shifted to 18ºC for 1 hour to cool down . Protein expression was induced with 50 µM IPTG and bacteria expressed protein for 20 hours at 18ºC before being harvested by centrifugation . For purification , cells were lysed into buffer containing 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 400 mM NaCl , 0 . 4 mM BME , 1 mM PMSF ( add twice , 15 minutes intervals ) , DNase , and 1 mg / mL lysozyme using a microtip sonicator . Lysate was centrifuged at 16 , 000 rpm ( 35 , 172 x g ) for 60 minutes in a Beckman JA - 17 rotor chilled to 4ºC . Lysate was circulated over 5 mL HiTrap Chelating column ( GE Healthcare , Cat # 17 - 0409 - 01 ) that had been equilibrated with 100 mM CoCl 2 for 1 hour , washed with MilliQ water , and followed by buffer containing 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 400 mM NaCl , 0 . 4 mM BME .

Peak fractions were pooled , combined with 50 µg / mL of His6 - SenP2 ( SUMO protease ) , and dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer containing 25 mM Na 2 HPO 4 [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 400 mM NaCl , and 0 . 4 mM BME for 16 - 18 hours at 4ºC . Following overnight cleavage of the SUMO3 tag , dialysate containing His6 - SUMO3 , His6 - SenP2 , and GGGGG - PIP4K2A was recirculated for at least 1 hour over a 5 mL HiTrap ( Co 2 + ) chelating column . Flow - through containing GGGGG - PIP4K2A was then concentrated in a 30 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 6 before loading onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion column equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7 ] , 200 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM TCEP . In some cases , cation exchange chromatography was used to increase the purity of GGGGG - PIP4K2A before loading on the Superdex 200 . In those cases , we equilibrated a MonoS column with 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7 ] , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP buffer . PIP4K2A ( pI = 6 . 9 ) bound to the MonoS was resolved over a 10 - 100 % linear gradient ( 0 . 1 - 1 M NaCl , 30 CV , 30 mL total , 1 . 5 mL / min flow rate ) . Peak fractions 17 collected from the Superdex 200 were concentrated in a 30 kDa MWCO Amicon centrifuge tube and snap frozen at a final concentration of 20 - 80 µM using liquid nitrogen . Purification of PH - PLC d 1 domain The coding sequence of human PH - PLC d 1 ( 11 - 140aa ) was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli as a His6 - SUMO3 - ( Gly ) 5 - PLC d 1 ( 11 - 140aa ) fusion protein . Bacteria were grown at 37ºC in Terrific Broth to an OD 600 of 0 . 8 . Cultures were shifted to 18ºC for 1 hour , induced with 0 . 1 mM IPTG , and allowed to express protein for 20 hours at 18ºC before being harvested .

Peak fractions were pooled , combined with SUMO protease ( 50 µg / mL final concentration ) , and dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer containing 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 300 mM NaCl , and 0 . 4 mM BME for 16 - 18 hours at 4ºC . Dialysate containing SUMO cleaved protein was recirculated for 1 hour over a 5 mL HiTrap Chelating column . Flow - through containing ( Gly ) 5 - PLC d 1 ( 11 - 140aa ) was then concentrated in a 5 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 20 before being loaded on a Superdex 75 size exclusion column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 200 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM TCEP . Peak fractions containing ( Gly ) 5 - PLC d 1 ( 11 - 140aa ) were pooled and concentrated to a maximum of 75 µM ( 1 . 2 mg / mL ) before freezing in liquid nitrogen . Purification of OCRL The coding sequence of human 5 - phosphatase OCRL ( 234 - 539aa of 901aa isoform ) was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli as a His6 - MBP - ( Asn ) 10 - TEV - ( Gly ) 5 - OCRL fusion protein . Bacteria were grown at 37ºC in Terrific Broth to an OD600 of 0 . 8 . Cultures were 18 shifted to 18ºC for 1 hour , induced with 0 . 1 mM IPTG , and allowed to express protein for 20 hours at 18ºC before being harvested . Cells were lysed into 50 mM Na H 2 PO 4 [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 300 mM NaCl , 0 . 4 mM BME , 1 mM PMSF , 100 µg / mL DNase using a microfluidizer . Lysate was then centrifuged at 16 , 000 rpm ( 35 , 172 x g ) for 60 minutes in a Beckman JA - 17 rotor chilled to 4ºC . Lysate was circulated over 5 mL HiTrap Chelating column ( GE Healthcare , Cat # 17 - 040901 ) charged with 100 mM CoCl2 for 1 hour . Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole ( 0 - 500 mM , 8 CV , 40 mL total , 2 mL / min flow rate ) . Peak fractions were pooled , combined with TEV protease ( 75 µg / mL final concentration ) , and dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer containing 50 mM Na H 2 PO 4 [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 300 mM NaCl , and 0 . 4 mM BME for 16 - 18 hours at 4ºC . Dialysate containing TEV protease cleaved protein was recirculated for 1 hour over a 5 mL HiTrap Chelating column . Flow - through containing ( Gly ) 5 - protein was then concentrated in a 5 kDa MWCO Vivaspin 20 before being loaded on a Superdex 75 ( 10 / 300 GL ) size exclusion column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 200 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM TCEP . Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated before snap freezing in liquid nitrogen . Sortase mediated peptide ligation PIP4K2A , PIP5K1A , and PH - PLC d 1 were labeled on a N - terminal ( Gly ) 5 motif using sortase mediated peptide ligation [ 17 , 64 ] . Initially , a LPETGG peptide was labeled with either Alexa488 , Alexa647 , or Cy5 conjugated to an amine reactive N - Hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) ( e . g . NHS - Alexa488 ) . Protein labeling was achieved by combining the fluorescently labeled LPETGG peptide with the following reagents : 50 mM Tris [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 50 µM ( Gly ) 5 - protein , 500 µM Alexa488 - LPETGG , and 10 - 15 µM His 6 - Sortase . This reaction mixture was incubated at 16 - 18ºC for 16 - 20 hours , before buffer exchange with a G25 Sephadex column ( e . g . PD10 ) to remove the majority of dye and dye - peptide . The His 6 - Sortase was then captured on Ni - NTA agarose resin ( Qiagen ) and unbound labeled protein was separated from remaining fluorescent dye and peptide using a Superdex 75 or Superdex 200 size exclusion column ( 24 mL bed volume ) . 19 Preparation of small unilamellar vesicles The following lipids were used to generated small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) : 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( 18 : 1 DOPC , Avanti # 850375C ) , L - α - phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate ( Brain PI ( 4 ) P , Avanti Cat # 840045X ) , L - α - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( Brain PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , Avanti # 840046X ) , and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( 18 : 1 DOPS , Avanti # 840035C ) . Lipids were purchased as single use ampules containing between 0 . 1 - 5 mg of lipids dissolved in chloroform . Brain PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were purchased as 0 . 25 mg / mL stocks dissolved in chloroform : methanol : water ( 20 : 9 : 1 ) . To make liposomes , 2 µmoles total lipids were combined in a 35 mL glass round bottom flask containing 2 mL of chloroform . Lipids were dried to a thin film using rotary evaporation with the glass round - bottom flask submerged in a 42ºC water bath . After evaporating all the chloroform , the round bottom flask was flushed with nitrogen gas for at least 30 minutes . We resuspended the lipid film in 2 mL of PBS [ pH 7 . 2 ] , making a final concentration of 1 mM total lipids . All lipid mixtures expressed as percentages ( e . g . 98 % DOPC , 2 % PI ( 4 ) P ) are equivalent to molar fractions . For example , a 1 mM lipid mixture containing 98 % DOPC and 2 % PI ( 4 ) P is equivalent to 0 . 98 mM DOPC and 0 . 02 mM PI ( 4 ) P . To generate 30 - 50 nm SUVs , 1 mM total lipid mixtures were extruded through a 0 . 03 µm pore size 19 mm polycarbonate membrane ( Avanti # 610002 ) with filter supports ( Avanti # 610014 ) on both sides of the PC membrane . Hydrated lipids at a concentration of 1 mM were extruded through the PC membrane 11 times . Preparation of supported lipid bilayers Supported lipid bilayers were formed on 25x75 mm coverglass ( IBIDI , # 10812 ) . Coverglass was first cleaned with 2 % Hellmanex III ( Fisher , Cat # 14 - 385 - 864 ) heated to 60 - 70ºC in a glass coplin jar and incubated for at least 30 minutes . We washed the coverglass extensively with MilliQ water and then etched with Pirahna solution ( 1 : 3 , hydrogen peroxide : sulfuric acid ) for 10 - 15 minutes the same day SLBs were formed . Etched coverglass , in water , was rapidly dried with nitrogen gas before adhering to a 6 - 20 well sticky - side chamber ( IBIDI , Cat # 80608 ) . SLBs were formed by flowing 30 nm SUVs diluted in PBS [ pH 7 . 2 ] to a total lipid concentration of 0 . 25 mM . After 30 minutes , IBIDI chambers were washed with 5 mL of PBS [ pH 7 . 2 ] to remove non - absorbed SUVs . Membrane defects were blocked for 15 minutes with a 1 mg / mL beta casein ( Thermo FisherSci , Cat # 37528 ) diluted in 1x PBS [ pH 7 . 4 ] . Before use as a blocking protein , frozen 10 mg / mL beta casein stocks were thawed , centrifuged for 30 minutes at 21 , 370 x g , and 0 . 22 µm syringe filtered . After blocking SLBs with beta casein , membranes were washed again with 1mL of PBS , followed by 1 mL of kinase buffer before TIRFM . Microscopy For all live - cell imaging experiments , cells were imaged in 1 . 6 mL of experiment specific imaging media . Base imaging media contained FluoroBrite DMEM ( Life Technologies A1896702 ) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) and 1 : 1000 chemically defined lipid supplement ( SF CHIM ) . Media was then further supplemented with either 10 % fetal bovine serum ( CHIM ) or 0 . 1 % BSA ( 0 . 1 % BSA CHIM ) . Alternatively , Ca 2 + free Ringer’s solution ( Ca 2 + Free ) was used , containing 160 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 8 mM glucose and 10 mM NaHEPES , pH 7 . 5 . For treatments , 0 . 4 mL of experiment specific imaging media containing fivefold final concentration of compound was applied to the dish ( or 0 . 5 ml for a second addition ) . Confocal imaging was performed on a Nikon TiE A1R platform with acquisition in resonant mode with a 100x 1 . 45 NA plan - apochromatic objective . The signal - to - noise ratio was improved by taking 8 or 16 frame averages . Excitation of fluorophores was accomplished using a dual fiber - coupled LUN - V laser launch with 405 - nm ( BFP ) , 488 - nm ( EGFP and NG2 ) , 561 - nm ( mCherry ) , and 640 - nm ( iRFP ) lines . Emission was collected on four separate photomultiplier tubes with blue ( 425 - 475 nm ) , green ( 500 - 550 nm ) , yellow / orange ( 570 - 620 nm ) , and far - red ( 663 - 737 nm ) filters . Blue and yellow / orange channels were recorded concurrently , as were green and far - red . The confocal pinhole was defined as 1 . 2x the Airy disc size of the longest wave - length 21 channel used in the experiment . In some instances , Nikon Elements denoising software was used to further enhance the signal - to - noise ratio . For TIRFM and single - molecule imaging ( SMol ) , a separate Nikon TiE platform coupled with a Nikon TIRF illuminator arm and 100x 1 . 45 NA plan - apochromatic objective was used . Excitation of fluorophores was accomplished using an Oxxius L4C laser launch with 405 - nm ( BFP ) , 488 - nm ( EGFP and NG2 ) , 561 - nm ( mCherry ) , and 638 - nm ( iRFP ) lines . Emission was collected through dual - pass filters ( Chroma ) with blue ( 420 - 480 nm ) and yellow / orange ( 570 - 620 nm ) together , and green ( 505 - 550 nm ) and far - red ( 650 - 850 nm ) together . An ORCA - Fusion BT sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) was used to capture images . For TIRFM , images were captured with 2x2 pixel binning . For SMol , the NG2 channel was excited with 100 % power for 50 ms from the 488 - nm laser in a 16x16 µm region of the PM . Images were registered in rolling shutter mode with 2x2 pixel binning with a 1 . 5x magnifier lens . For all types of imaging , Nikon Elements software was used to acquire all images for all experiments and all data was saved with the ND2 file extension . Membrane binding and lipid phosphorylation reactions reconstituted on supported lipid bilayers ( SLBs ) were visualized using an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope using a 100x Nikon ( 1 . 49 NA ) oil immersion TIRF objective . TIRF microscopy images of SLBs were acquired using an iXion Life 897 EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology Ltd . , UK ) . Fluorescently labeled proteins were excited with either a 488 nm , 561 nm , or 637 nm diode laser ( OBIS laser diode , Coherent Inc . Santa Clara , CA ) controlled with a Vortran laser drive with acousto - optic tunable filters ( AOTF ) control . The power output measured through the objective for single particle imaging was 1 - 2 mW . Excitation light was passed through the following dichroic filter cubes before illuminating the sample : ( 1 ) ZT488 / 647rpc and ( 2 ) ZT561rdc ( ET575LP ) ( Semrock ) . Fluorescence emission was detected on the iXion Life 897 EMCCD camera position after a Nikon emission filter wheel housing the following emission filters : ET525 / 50M , ET600 / 50M , ET700 / 75M 22 ( Semrock ) . All experiments were performed at room temperature ( 23ºC ) . Microscope hardware was controlled by Nikon NIS elements . Image analysis Analysis of all images was accomplished using Fiji software [ 65 ] using the LOCI BioFormats importer [ 66 ] . Custom macros were written to generate channel - specific montages displaying all x , y positions captured in an experiment in concatenated series . In these montages , individual regions of interest ( ROIs ) were generated around displayed cells . For confocal images , the ratio of fluorescence intensity between specific compartments was analyzed as described previously [ 58 ] . In brief , a custom macro was used to generate a compartment of interest specific binary mask through à trous wavelet decomposition [ 67 ] . This mask was applied to measure the fluorescence intensity within the given compartment while normalizing to the mean pixel intensity in the ROI . ROI corresponded to the whole cell ( denoted PM / Cell ratio ) or a region of cytosol ( PM / Cyt ) , as indicated on the y axis of individual figures . For TIRFM images , a minimum intensity projection was used to generate ROIs within the smallest footprint of the cells . Background fluorescence was measured and subtracted from all images at all timepoints . The average pixel intensity in each frame ( F t ) was normalized to the mean pixel intensity in the ROI of the time points before treatment ( F pre ) to yield F t / F pre . Quantitative data was imported into Prism 8 ( GraphPad ) for statistical analysis and the generation of graphs and plots . D’Agostino and Pearson normality tests showed data that significantly varied from normal distribution , data were then subjected to a nonparametric Kruskal - Wallis test . If significant difference was found between sample medians , a post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test was run . 23 Representative images were selected based on fluorescence measurements near the median of the sampled population , displayed typical morphology , and robust signal - to - noise ratio . If adjusting brightness or contrast , any changes were made across the entire image . Single Molecule Analysis using TrackMate Mean photon count was estimated using Fiji [ 65 ] . Either HEK293A cells expressing PH - PLC d 1 - mNG2x1 - 3 , NG2 - PIP4K2A , NG2 - PIP4K2B , or NG2 - PIP4K2C cells were imaged using SMol settings . Raw images were converted to 32 - bit , background subtracted , and grey levels converted into photon counts . These images were then run through Fiji using the TrackMate plugin . Settings for molecule localization were : LoG detector : estimated blob diameter 0 . 18 µm , threshold 40 ; initial thresholding by quality ; filters on spots : total intensity to match surface localized particles , excluding puncta less than 3 ; simple LAP tracker : linking max distance 0 . 5 µm , gap - closing max distance 0 . 5 µm , gap - closing max frame gap 2 . To determine fluorescence intensity per spot , histograms of mean intensity , in each condition , were generated using a 5 - photon bin size . Kinetic measurements of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production The kinetics of PI ( 4 ) P phosphorylation was measured on SLBs formed in IBIDI chambers and visualized using TIRF microscopy as previously described [ 17 ] . Reaction buffer contained 20 mM HEPES [ pH 7 . 0 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM ATP , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 20 mM glucose , 200 µg / mL beta casein ( ThermoScientific , Cat # 37528 ) , 20 mM BME , 320 µg / mL glucose oxidase ( Serva , # 22780 . 01 Aspergillus niger ) , 50 µg / mL catalase ( Sigma , # C40 - 100MG Bovine Liver ) , and 2 mM Trolox ( UV treated , see methods below ) . Perishable reagents ( i . e . glucose oxidase , catalase , and Trolox ) were added 5 - 10 minutes before image acquisition . For all experiments , we monitored the change in PI ( 4 ) P or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 membrane density using solution concentrations of 20 nM Alexa647 - DrrA ( 544 - 647 ) or 20 nM Alexa488 - PLC d 1 , respectively .

Reciprocal regulation of PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels by PIP5K and PIP4K . ( A ) PIP5Ks increase PM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 independently of catalytic activity .

Images show equatorial confocal sections of HeLa cells expressing the low affinity Tubby CR332H PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sensor ( orange ) , co - transfected with EGFP - tagged catalytically active or dead PIP5K constructs ( yeast Mss4 or mammalian A , B , or C paralogs ) , or EGFP alone as control , scale bar is 10 µm . Increased PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is apparent from higher Tubby CR332H fluorescence in the PM . Box and whisker plots show the mean fluorescence intensity ratio ( PM / Cell ) of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sensor from > 90 cells imaged across at least three independent experiments ( boxes displaying median and interquartile range , whiskers representing 10 - 90 % of data and “ + ” represents mean ; * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) .

( D ) Proposed inhibition of ePIP5K ( endogenous PIP5K ) by ePIP4K . With the overexpression of a fluorescently tagged version of PIP5K , regardless of catalytic activity , ePIP4K is sequestered . This relieves endogenous PIP5K from inhibition , increasing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . 35 Fig . 2 . The activity of PIP5K is blunted by PIP4K .

HeLa cells expressing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 indicator Tubby CR332H ( orange ) were co - transfected with the indicated EGFP - or TagBFP2 - tagged constructs . Images show confocal equatorial sections of representative cells , scale bar is 10 µm . Box and whisker plots show the mean fluorescence intensity ratio ( PM / Cell ) of the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 sensor from > 90 cells imaged across at least three independent experiments ( boxes displaying median and interquartile range , whiskers representing 10 - 90 % of data and “ + ” represents mean ; * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( C ) PIP4K2A attenuates the kinetics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production driven by PIP5K1A , but not Mss4 . Kinetics of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production measured on SLBs in the presence of 1 nM PIP5K1A , 20 nM PH - PLC d 1 , ± 50 nM PIP4K2A . Inhibition of PIP5K1A activity is delayed until a threshold density of approximately 2 % PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is created to support membrane recruitment of PIP4K2A . Inset shows kinetics of reactions executed in the presence of 50 nM Mss4 , 20 nM PH - PLC d 1 , ± 50 nM PIP4K2A . Initial membrane composition : 76 % DOPC , 20 % DOPS , 4 % PI ( 4 ) P . Right graphs show the quantification of time required for reactions to reach 95 % completion ( n = 3 technical replicates ) . 36 Fig . 3 . Endogenously tagged PIP4Ks are associated with the PM . ( A ) Endogenous tagging of PIP4K . Brief cartoon schematic showing the mechanism of endogenous tagging employed for PIP4K with NeonGreen2 ( NG2 ) . The resulting cell lines were termed NG2 - PIP4K . This strategy was used for all three paralogs of PIP4K . ( B ) For PIP4K2A and PIP4K2B paralogs , cells were genotyped with paralog specific forward and reverse primer yielding an edited product of ~ 350bp . For PIP4K2C , cells were genotyped with a NG2 specific forward primer and a PIP4K2C paralog specific reverse primer yielding an edited product of ~ 200bp . NG2 - PIP4K2C cells were also probed with a PIP4K2C specific antibody showing the expected ~ 3 kDa shift in weight ( arrowhead ) . ( C ) Confocal based characterization of NG2 - PIP4K . Confocal images display the NG2 - PIP4K ( blue ) in cells localized mainly to the cytosol , scale bar is 100 µm or 10 µm , as noted . In the case of NG2 - PIP4K2C , slight association of the enzyme to the PM can be seen in the zoomed image , scale bar for zoomed images is 5 µm . ( D ) TIRF based characterization of NG2 - PIP4K . When imaged live by TIRF , dynamic , diffraction limited spots are observed on the membrane ( compare differential localization at 0 and + 300 ms ) , scale bar is 2 . 5 µm . ( E ) Endogenous PIP4Ks exists as heterogeneous populations . All three PIP4K paralogs have an intensity consistent with a mixed population of 1 or 2 mNG molecules when calibrated against single , dimeric or trimeric mNG molecules fused to a PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding domain . This correlates to the mean photon count of heterogeneously tagged cell populations ( one or two alleles tagged with NG2 11 ) . Data are grand mean photon counts ± 95 % C . I . for data acquired from 22 - 43 cells . Linear regression and resulting R 2 against grand mean values is also plotted . ( F ) Endogenous expression levels vary between PIP4K 37 paralogs . The raw fluorescence intensity of NG2 - PIP4K2A , NG2 - PIP4K2B , or NG2 - PIP4K2C in each tagged cell line was measured and plotted against the mean photon counts from E . Plotted pointes show the raw fluorescence intensity of each NG2 - PIP4K paralog from 90 cells imaged across three independent experiments ( circles display the mean and error bars representing s . e . ) . There is a positive correlation between the expression level of each paralog and its likelihood to be visualized as a monomeric vs a dimeric protein ( Linear regression and resulting R 2 against mean values is plotted ) . PIP4K2A and PIP4K2B may exist as either homodimers or more likely heterodimers ; whereas PIP4K2C more likely homodimerizes . 38 Fig . 4 .

At the PM , PIP4K interacts with and inhibits the catalytic activity of PIP5K , causing reduced PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis . ( B ) PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensors detect a gradient of lipid levels . HEK293A cells were transfected with the indicated fluorescently tagged PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 modulating proteins ( INPP5E , myrPIP4K2A , myrLyn 11 , PIP5K1A catalytic dead or active ) and the indicated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 biosensor ( PH - PLC d 1 , Tubby , or Tubby R332H displayed in orange ) for 16 - 24 hours , scale bar is 10 µm . Mean fluorescence intensity ( PM / Cyt ) are shown as points with error bars representing s . e . of > 120 cells imaged across three independent experiments . ( C ) PLC - mediated Ca 2 + signals saturate at tonic PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . Cartoon schematics of PLC mediated Ca 2 + signaling and detection . HEK293A cells were transfected with the indicated fluorescently tagged construct and the calcium sensor R - GECO ( purple ) . During time - lapse confocal microscopy ( performed with either compete imaging media containing 1 . 8 mM Ca 2 + [ Ca 2 + ] or calcium free Ringer’s media [ Ca 2 + - Free ] ) , cells were stimulated with 100 µM CCh as indicated . Traces represent the peak response of mean change in 43 fluorescence intensity ( F t / F Pre normalized to pre - stimulation levels ) ± s . e . of > 100 cells imaged across a minimum of three independent experiments . The peak response and total area under the curve ( AUC ) were plotted against the normalized ratio of Tubby C . ( D ) PI3K mediated PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 synthesis is linearly dependent on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels . Cartoon schematics show PI3K mediated signaling and detection of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 upon the addition of EGF . HEK293A cells were transfected with the indicated fluorescently tagged construct and the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 biosensor , PH - ARNO 2G - I303Ex2 ( aPHx2 ) ( magenta ) , scale bar is 10 µm and inset scale bar is 2 . 5 µm . During time - lapse confocal microscopy , cells were stimulated with 10 ng / mL EGF , as indicated . Traces represent the peak response of mean change in fluorescence intensity ( change in PM / Cyt from pre - stimulation levels ) ± s . e . of 35 cells imaged across a minimum of three independent experiments . The peak response and AUC were plotted against the normalized ratio of Tubby C . 44 Construct : EGFP ( n = 2294 ) Mss4 Mss4 CD PIP5K1A PIP5K1A CD PIP5K1B PIP5K1B CD PIP5K1C Mss4 ( n = 90 ) < 0 . 0001 Mss4 CD ( n = 90 ) 0 . 0324 < 0 . 0001 PIP5K1A ( n = 299 ) < 0 . 0001 < 0 . 0001 < 0 . 0001 PIP5K1A CD ( n = 90 ) < 0 . 0001 < 0 . 0001 < 0 . 0001 > 0 . 9999 PIP5K1B ( n = 180 ) < 0 . 0001 < 0 . 0001 < 0 . 0001 > 0 . 9999 > 0 . 9999 PIP5K1B CD ( n = 90 ) < 0 . 0001 < 0 . 0001 0 . 0001 > 0 . 9999 > 0 . 9999 > 0 . 9999 PIP5K1C ( n = 1729 ) < 0 . 0001 0 . 0003 < 0 . 0001 > 0 . 9999 0 . 4741 0 . 0094 0 . 2673 PIP5K1C CD ( n = 384 ) < 0 . 0001 0 . 0347 < 0 . 0001 0 . 3338 0 . 0743 0 . 001 0 . 0396 > 0 . 9999 Table 1 : P values from Kruskal - Wallis test with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons for Tubby c R332H ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) biosensor data presented in Figure 1A .
