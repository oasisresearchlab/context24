Healthy RBCs have a bicon - cave shape and a ﬂexible membrane enabling them to undergo substantial reversible elastic deformation as they traverse narrow capillaries during microcirculation . This RBC deformability is critical for eﬃcient circulation while the unique biconcave shape of healthy RBCs is attributed to their speciﬁc volume , which aﬀects the amount of oxygen they can carry . However , despite extensive research , the underlying mech - anism that determines the optimal RBC volume remains unknown . This paper examines the impact of RBC volume on the eﬃciency of oxygen transport from a ﬂuid dynamics standpoint . Our investigation reveals that RBCs with volumes similar to those observed in vivo demonstrate superior oxygen transport eﬃciency in circular tubes similar to arterioles , which represent areas of the circulatory system with the highest ﬂow resistance . Furthermore , we identify mechanisms that impair oxygen transport when the RBC volume deviates from the optimal value . While healthy RBCs produce a maximum cell - free layer thickness that aﬀects ﬂow dissipation , smaller RBC volumes result in greater deformations and thus dissipate more energy . Strikingly , the ﬂow resistance is minimized at the reduced volume of healthy RBCs . Our study highlights that the volume of healthy RBCs maximizes oxygen transport eﬃciency and may oﬀer insight into developing targeted treatments for circulatory disorders . Blood ﬂow plays a vital role in sustaining life as it enables the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to ev - ery tissue and organ in the body while also remov - ing harmful waste like carbon dioxide . Red blood cells ( RBCs ) are a crucial component of blood , mak - ing up almost half of the total blood volume in hu - mans [ 31 ] . These specialized cells are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body , where it is used to fuel cellular metabolism . They are formed by a visco - elastic membrane that surrounds the cytosol of the cell . The cytosol con - tains a high concentration of hemoglobin , which is responsible for the transportation of oxygen [ 31 , 9 ] . The RBC membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer anchored to a cytoskeleton and allows for signiﬁcant deformations [ 25 ] . The lipid bilayer of the membrane behaves like an incompressible liquid crystal with localized bending resistance , while the cytoskeleton provides resistance to local shear and dilation [ 19 ] . According to current models , the unstressed shape of the cytoskeleton is an oblate spheroid of reduced vol - ume approximately 0 . 95 , compared to a sphere with the same membrane area [ 25 , 19 , 3 ] . However , at equilibrium healthy RBCs adopt a biconcave shape with a reduced volume ( v ) of approximately 0 . 65 [ 13 ] . In this paper , we postulate that this volume size is optimal for oxygen transport given a ﬁxed membrane area . The biconcave shape and reduced volume of RBCs as well as metrics for their optimality remain a sub - ject of debate in the scientiﬁc community . Can - ham [ 6 ] suggested that the biconcave shape minimizes 1 a r X i v : 2 3 05 . 02197v1 [ phy s i c s . b i o - ph ] 2 8 A p r 2023 the bending energy of the membrane for a given re - duced volume . However , this theory does not ex - plain why RBCs have this particular reduced volume . Some researchers proposed that the biconcave shape allows for a large surface - to - volume ratio for RBCs so that they maximize oxygen exchange between the RBC interior and their environment [ 24 , 38 ] . The exchange of oxygen between the cytoplasm and the environment is higher for cells with lower thickness because cytoplasmic diﬀusion may be more limiting than membrane permeability , as shown by Richard - son et al . [ 34 ] . Other studies suggest that the bicon - cave shape allows for a more eﬃcient ﬂow through capillaries and kidney tubules due to the RBCs’ de - formability [ 25 , 30 , 39 , 29 ] . Uzoigwe [ 38 ] proposed that RBCs have a biconcave shape to maximize their moment of inertia , thereby reducing shear in blood ﬂow and decreasing blood ﬂow resistance in arteries , but did not present any quantitative results . Guo et al . [ 20 ] showed that the volume of cells aﬀects their stiﬀness , while other studies found that osmotic pres - sure and cell stiﬀness aﬀect the viscosity of whole blood [ 37 , 36 , 32 , 35 ] . Alterations in RBC volume can signiﬁcantly impact the function of the circula - tory system and individual health [ 38 ] . In this study , we investigate the hypothesis that the reduced volume of RBCs is optimized for eﬃ - cient oxygen transport in the circulatory system . To test this hypothesis , we study the transport of a ﬁxed quantity of hemoglobin by RBCs with varying resting shapes parameterized by the reduced volume of the cells . We investigate the eﬀect of the RBC reduced volume on the oxygen ﬂux in a circular tube . This metric has been used experimentally to determine the optimal hematocrit for oxygen transport [ 36 ] . We choose a tube with dimensions and pressure gradient similar to those found in arterioles , where ﬂow resis - tance is highest in the circulatory system [ 5 , 7 , 27 , 28 ] . The study relies on a recent and appropriately val - idated RBC model , comprising visco - elastic mem - branes enclosing the cytosol and suspended in the blood plasma . The model was extensively calibrated in Amoudruz et al . [ 3 ] and validated against exper - imental data in various ﬂow conditions . The evo - lution of the solvent and the cytosol are described by dissipative particle dynamics ( DPD ) [ 21 , 12 ] . Simulations are performed with Mirheo , a high - performance software for blood ﬂow and microﬂu - idics [ 1 ] . Results We examine the ﬂow of RBCs that are suspended within a circular tube with a radius R = 40 µ m , which is intended to simulate the characteristics of arterioles . The volume fraction of RBCs , or hema - tocrit , is set to Ht = 45 % and the blood sus - pension is subjected to a pressure gradient ∇ p = 1 × 10 − 3 cmH 2 O µ m − 1 , typical for arterioles of this size [ 18 ] . We study diﬀerent cases with RBC mem - branes all having the same area and visco - elastic properties but with a diﬀerent reduced volume v = V 0 / V s , where V 0 is the volume of one cell and V s is that of a sphere with the same area as the cell’s mem - brane . The number of RBCs is adapted to keep the hematocrit constant , N = (cid:98) πR 2 L Ht / V 0 (cid:99) . We study a periodic domain with a length L = 100 µ m and all quantities are reported for equilibrated ﬂow condi - tions . We ﬁnd that the reduced volume aﬀects the ﬂow patterns and RBCs deformability ( ﬁg . 1 ) . Speciﬁ - cally , for low reduced volumes , the cells deform much more than at high values of v . In the limit v → 1 , only spherical cells are allowed , and as the area is constant they cannot deform . RBCs with a healthy reduced volume do not exhibit signiﬁcant deforma - tions compared to those with lower reduced volumes . Instead , healthy RBCs seem to keep a relatively ﬂat shape similar to tank - treading RBCs . We quantify the amount of oxygen transport by computing the ﬂux of cytosol in the tube for each value of v , Q h = V 0 L N (cid:88) i = 1 U i , where U i is the time - averaged velocity of the i th RBC’s center of mass . We assume that the cytosol contains hemoglobin in equal concentrations for each case so that the ﬂux of cytosol is proportional to the ﬂux of oxygen . Figure 2 shows the ﬂux of cytosol Q h , normalized by the ﬂux of plasma at Ht = 0 , 2 Figure 1 : Snapshots of RBCs ﬂowing near the walls of the tube . The ﬂow direction is from left to right . Cells with diﬀerent reduced volumes respond diﬀerently to ﬂow shear ( from left to right : v = 0 . 35 , 0 . 65 , 0 . 95 ) . 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 v 0 . 14 0 . 15 0 . 16 0 . 17 0 . 18 0 . 19 0 . 20 Q h / Q p Figure 2 : Cytosol ﬂux , normalized by that of the plasma at zero hematocrit , against the reduced vol - ume of RBCs ﬂowing in the tube . Q p = | ∇ p | πR 4 / 8 η , where η is the dynamic viscos - ity of the plasma , against the reduced volume of the RBCs . In these conditions , Q h reaches a maximum at a reduced volume v ≈ 0 . 65 . Strikingly , the ﬂow resis - tance is minimized at the reduced volume of healthy RBCs . In order to elucidate the mechanisms that reduce the cytosol ﬂux when the volume of the RBCs de - viates from its healthy RBC value , we examine the cell - free layer ( CFL ) near the walls of the tube . We report its thickness , δ , with respect to the reduced volume v in ﬁg . 3 . The larger CFL thickness corre - sponds to a larger region of high shear rate resulting in a larger ﬂux of hemoglobin ( ﬁgs . 2 and 3 ) as the 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 v 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 δ [ µ m ] Figure 3 : Cell - free layer thickness against the reduced volume of RBCs ﬂowing in the tube . blood suspension has a larger eﬀective viscosity than pure plasma [ 8 ] . Thus , for a given pressure diﬀerence , a smaller CFL is responsible for a lower oxygen ﬂux . We suggest that the change in the CFL thickness depends on the reduced volume of the RBCs . We explain this dependency by observing the deforma - tions of RBCs and their trajectories . The deforma - tion of the cells are quantiﬁed by the rim angle ( see below ) and bending energy of each cell . We distin - guish tumbling - like motion due to the external shear stresses , from tank - treading motion , where the mem - brane rotates around a steady shape . The cell trajec - tories are quantiﬁed by the diﬀusion coeﬃcient along the azimuth direction . 3 θ Figure 4 : Left : The rim ( white ) of a RBC at rest . Right : The normal of the rim plane ( dark arrow ) and the normal of the cell plane ( red arrow ) form the rim angle θ . 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 v 0 45 90 θ Figure 5 : Violin plots illustrating the variation in rim angle distribution θ ( in degrees ) of ﬂowing cells across diﬀerent reduced volumes v . Crosses indicate the mean value of θ . Rim angle We deﬁne the rim angle as the angle between the normal to the principal disc of the cell and that of the region corresponding to the rim of the stress - free state of the cell , see ﬁg . 4 and ref . [ 11 ] . For a tum - bling RBC , this angle is typically low while for tank - treading RBCs the angle takes values in the whole range , θ ∈ [ 0 , π / 2 ] . Figure 5 shows the distribution of rim angles θ of cells ﬂowing in the tube for diﬀerent values of v . On average , the rim angles are smaller at low values of v . Furthermore , the density of θ is more uniform at high values of v than at low reduced volume values . 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 v 200 400 600 800 E b / κ b Figure 6 : Violin plots illustrating the variation in bending energy distribution of ﬂowing cells across dif - ferent reduced volumes v . Crosses indicate the mean value of the bending energy while the shaded regions indicate the maximum density . κ b is the bending modulus . This suggests that RBCs with a large reduced volume tank - tread while their motion is closer to tumbling at lower values of v . Bending energy The deformations of the cells are characterized by the bending energy ( eq . ( 1 ) ) . The bending energy of the membrane is high when the cell deforms ( e . g . folds ) and therefore characterizes complex dynamics and shape changes . The bending energy distribution of the cells is shown on ﬁg . 6 for diﬀerent values of v . The mean bending energy decreases with increasing values of v . This is consistent with the fact that the minimum bending energy is achieved for a spherical shape . Nevertheless , we observe diﬀerences in the distribu - tions of the bending energies . For v ≥ 0 . 6 , the bending energies are concentrated close to a mini - mal value . Instead , when v < 0 . 6 , we observe a peak of bending energy well above the minimal values ob - served at each reduced volume . These high values suggest that RBCs undergo large deformations com - pared to their resting shape . In particular , we ob - serve cells that are “folding” periodically when v is 4 Figure 7 : Time sequence of a folding and unfolding RBC ( time increasing from left to right ) . The cell has a reduced volume v = 0 . 4 . The white stripe represents the rim of the cell at rest ( see ﬁg . 4 ) . relatively small ( ﬁg . 7 ) , as opposed to cells that have a large reduced volume . This mechanism may explain the decrease of the CFL thickness at low values of v . Indeed , when folding or experiencing large deforma - tions , the eﬀective thickness of the RBCs increases and thus the CFL thickness decreases . In addition , the folding of RBCs is accompanied by a high dissi - pation due to the recirculation of the cytosol inside the cell , which may further decrease the blood ﬂux . Tank - treading frequency In linear shear ﬂows , RBCs tank - tread when the shear rate is large enough [ 16 , 10 ] . The tank - treading frequency ( TTF ) is reported against the time aver - aged radial position of the cells on ﬁg . 8 . For low values of v , most cells do not tank - tread hence the value estimated for the TTF is low . For larger val - ues of v , the TTF increases linearly with the radial position . This increase is consistent with the nearly linear relationship between the TTF and the shear rate for single cells [ 16 ] , and assuming that we have a nearly parabolic velocity proﬁle along the radial direction of the tube , hence a linear increase of the shear rate with the radial position r . Furthermore , we observe that the TTF of cells is larger when v in - creases . This is also expected since spheres in shear ﬂows rotate with a larger frequency than the TTF of RBCs [ 16 ] . We suggest that , for relatively thin cells , tank - treading is beneﬁcial for cells to pass each other without deforming and to minimize the eﬀect of their 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 r / R 0 50 100 150 ν [ H z ] Figure 8 : TTF of the RBCs against their time av - eraged radial position , for v = 0 . 4 ( circles ) , v = 0 . 7 ( triangles ) and v = 0 . 9 ( squares ) . The symbols and error bars indicate the binned median and the 5 % to 95 % quantiles , respectively . collisions , thus contributing to a lower value of δ . Azimuth diﬀusion To characterize the trajectories of the cells , we mea - sure the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the cells’ positions . Since the RBC suspension is conﬁned along the ra - dial axis of the tube , and the ﬂow is along the tube’s axis , we report only the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of cells along the azimuth direction . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient is estimated from the mean squared displacement of 5 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 v 0 . 00 0 . 05 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 D [ µ m 2 m s − 1 ] Figure 9 : Azimuth diﬀusion D of the RBCs against the reduced volume v . The error bars correspond to the standard error of D . the cells along the azimuth direction , D = lim t →∞ (cid:104) l ( t ) 2 (cid:105) / 2 t , l ( t ) = φ ( t ) (cid:90) φ ( 0 ) rdφ , where r is the radial position of the cell’s center of mass and φ is the corresponding azimuth angle in cylindrical coordinates . The diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the cells is reported against v on ﬁg . 9 . The azimuth diﬀusion increases with the reduced volume of the cells v . We attribute this increase in diﬀusion to the non - deformability of the cells at high values of v . Indeed , for low values of v the cells can deform enough to avoid migrating perpendicularly to the ﬂow direction when passing each other . In con - trast , at high values of v , the cells do not deform , causing the collision with other cells to deviate their trajectories from the ﬂow direction . The collisions , and thus migrations of the cells in the directions per - pendicular to the ﬂow , may contribute to reducing the CFL thickness for v > 0 . 65 , thus decreasing the transport eﬃciency of the cytosol . Discussion At a physiological hematocrit , the reduced volume of healthy RBCs maximizes the transport of cytosol 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 δ [ µ m ] 0 . 14 0 . 15 0 . 16 0 . 17 0 . 18 0 . 19 0 . 20 Q h / Q p Figure 10 : Cytosol ﬂux against the CFL thickness . Circles correspond to cells with v < 0 . 65 , triangles those with v > 0 . 65 and the square is for v = 0 . 65 . through relatively large tubes . When the reduced volume of the RBCs deviates from that of healthy cells , we identify two factors that decrease the trans - port eﬃciency of oxygen : the change of the CFL thickness , and the dissipation due to the cytosol re - circulation and the deformations of the cells . The viscosity of plasma is smaller than that of whole blood , thus a larger CFL thickness contributes to a higher ﬂux of blood . We ﬁnd that the CFL thick - ness is maximized at v ≈ 0 . 65 . Below this value , cells fold , undergo large deformations and adopt a tum - bling rather than tank - treading motion . These de - formations increase the eﬀective thickness of the cells along the radial direction , thus reducing the CFL thickness . In contrast , at larger values of v , cells do not deform and have more diﬀusive trajectories , due to collisions with their neighboring cells . These colli - sions cause the cells to migrate perpendicularly to the ﬂow direction , thus reducing the CFL thickness . At intermediate values of v , the cells tank - tread , which facilitate their motion relative to each other . This is supported by the shear - thinning behavior of blood when the motion of RBCs transitions from tumbling to tank - treading [ 15 , 17 ] . The non - spherical shape of healthy RBCs limits the eﬀect of collisions , and they form a maximal CFL thickness . The CFL thickness alone does not explain the pro - 6 ﬁle observed in ﬁg . 2 . Indeed , for the same value of CFL thickness , the cytosol ﬂux is lower for the case with v < 0 . 65 than when v > 0 . 65 ( ﬁg . 10 ) . We attribute this diﬀerence to the additional dissipation due to the large deformations occurring for cells with smaller reduced volumes . In addition , we expect that tank - treading cells dissipate more energy at lower re - duced volumes , as shown for vesicles [ 23 ] . We remark that in this study we chose ﬂow con - ditions corresponding to arterioles , which contribute to the highest ﬂow resistance in the circulatory sys - tem . We argue that this trend will remain the same if we sampled a broader range of tube conﬁgurations , including large arteries and small capillary vessels . In the latter case , cells with a large reduced volume would not ﬂow due to their large size and would thus have a low oxygen transport eﬃciency in these con - ditions . Furthermore we remark that in our study we have neglected the non - uniformity and deformations of the vasculature , the eﬀect of the glycocalyx , the variability of the membrane visco - elastic properties and the pressure waves due to heart beats . While we do not expect major qualitative changes , the eﬀect of these perturbations will be the subject of further research . Summary We demonstrate , through high ﬁdelity simulations , that RBCs with volumes similar to those observed in vivo optimize the eﬃciency of oxygen transport in circular tubes similar to arterioles . We deploy high ﬁdelity simulations of a thoroughly validated RBC model in ﬂow conditions close to those found in arte - rioles , where the vascular resistance is maximal . We qualitatively explain the variation of oxygen trans - port eﬃciency with respect of the reduced volume of the cells based on the CFL thickness and the dissi - pation due to the cells deformability . At low reduced volumes , cells deform and fold , thus occupy a larger eﬀective volume on average . This causes the CFL thickness to decrease . In addition , the deformations of cells induces large dissipation due to the recircu - lation of the cytosol . At large reduced volumes , cells collide and migrate in the directions perpendicular to the ﬂow . These trajectories also contribute to reduc - ing the CFL thickness and thus the oxygen transport is lower . The present ﬁndings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of oxygen transport in the body and could potentially have signiﬁcant implications for the advancement of therapies aimed at treating circula - tory disorders . Methods Blood Model We model blood with RBCs’s composed of visco - elastic membranes surrounding their viscous cytosol , and suspended in the blood plasma . The RBC mem - brane deforms from forces that arise from bending resistance of the lipid - bilayer , as well as due to the shear and dilation elasticity of the cytoskeleton with respect to its stress - free state ( SFS ) , and membrane viscosity . The resistance to bending is described by the energy : U bending = 2 κ b (cid:73) H 2 dA , ( 1 ) where the integral is taken over the membrane sur - face , κ b is the bending modulus and H is the local mean curvature . The in - plane elastic energy is given by U in − plane = K α 2 (cid:73) (cid:0) α 2 + a 3 α 3 + a 4 α 4 (cid:1) dA 0 + µ (cid:73) (cid:0) β + b 1 αβ + b 2 β 2 (cid:1) dA 0 , where the integral is taken over the SFS surface , α and β are the local dilation and shear strain invari - ants , respectively , K α is the dilation elastic modulus , µ is the shear elastic modulus and the coeﬃcients a 3 , a 4 , b 1 and b 2 are parameters that control the non - linearity of the membrane elasticity for large defor - mations [ 26 ] . In the present model the membrane is composed of particles located at the corners of a triangulated mesh and evolve according to Newton’s law of mo - tion . The bending energy is discretized following ref - erences [ 22 , 4 ] , and the in - plane energy is computed 7 Parameter Value κ b 2 . 10 × 10 − 19 J µ 4 . 99 µ N m − 1 K α 4 . 99 µ N m − 1 a 3 − 2 a 4 8 b 1 0 . 7 b 2 1 . 84 η m 0 . 42 × 10 − 6 Pa s m A 0 135 µ m 2 V 0 varying k A 0 . 5 J / m 2 k V 7 . 23 × 10 5 J / m 3 Table 1 : Parameters of the RBC model . as described in Lim et al . [ 25 ] . The forces acting on the particles are the negative gradients of the dis - cretized energy terms , with respect to the particle po - sitions . Dissipation on the membrane is modeled by particles sharing an edge in the triangle mesh that ex - ert a pairwise force as described in Fedosov [ 14 ] , pro - portional to the membrane viscosity η m . Finally , the area of the membrane and the volume of the cytosol are constrained through energy penalization terms , U area = k A ( A − A 0 ) 2 A 0 , U volume = k V ( V − V 0 ) 2 V 0 , where A 0 and V 0 are the area and volume of the cell at rest and A and V are the area and volume of the cell , respectively . The values of the RBC parameters are listed in table 1 . The RBC cytosol and surrounding plasma are rep - resented with particles that evolve through DPD in - teractions [ 21 , 12 , 3 ] . We emphasize that the model parameters are selected so as to correspond to the 1 : 5 ratio of viscosities for the plasma and the RBC cy - tosol . To model the no - slip and no - through boundary conditions on walls , particles are bounced - back and interact with frozen particles through DPD interac - tions [ 33 ] . In addition , DPD particles are bounced - back from membrane surfaces , with conservation of momentum , and interact with the membrane parti - cles through the dissipative and stochastic parts of the DPD interactions [ 14 ] . The cytosol and plasma particles interact with each other only through the conservative part of the DPD forces . The DPD pa - rameters are chosen as described in [ 2 ] . Computation of the TTF The TTF is estimated by computing the Fourier transform of the rim angle time series of each cell and selecting the frequency of the largest mode , di - vided by 2 since the rim angle of a tank - treading cell undergoes 2 revolutions per tank - treading revolution . Note that we exclude cells having an average rim an - gle ¯ θ larger than π / 4 , and the tumbling cells , which we characterize by ¯ θ < π / 8 .
