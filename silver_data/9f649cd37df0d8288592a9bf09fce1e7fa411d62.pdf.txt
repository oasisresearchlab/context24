In total , 381 subjects aged 6 - 99 years , who had 37 either recovered from the disease or had been vaccinated , were screened for SARS - CoV - 2 - specific 38 antibodies . This screening was part of an open observational study with working adults . Additionally , 39 children and adults were analyzed in a longitudinal COVID - 19 study in schools . For immunity 40 evaluation , virus neutralization tests and ELISpot tests were performed in a subgroup of subjects . 41 Results : Viramed revealed a slightly lower test performance than Roche , but test quality was equally 42 well in samples from very young or very old donors . The time - point of seroconversion after the 43 respective immunization detected by the two tests was not significantly different . N - specific 44 antibodies , detected with Roche , highly correlated with NAbs in recovered subjects , whereas a 45 positive Viramed - Test result was paralleled by a positive ELISpot result . 46 Conclusion : Viramed - Test was not as sensitive as Roche - Test , but highly specific and beneficial to 47 distinguish between recovered and vaccinated status . For both tests correlations with humoral and 48 3 cellular immunity were found . Of note , the expected early detection of IgA and IgM by the Roche - 49 Test did not prove to be an advantage over IgG testing by Viramed . 50 Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 - specific antibodies , seroconversion , test performance , neutralizing 51 antibodies , T - cell - reactivity 52 Abbreviations : Ig : immune - globulin ; N : nucleocapsid protein ; n : number ; NAbs : neutralizing 53 antibodies ; PCR : polymerase - chain - reaction ; RBD : receptor - binding - domain ; S : spike - glycoprotein ; 54 SARS - CoV - 2 : Severe - Acute - Respiratory - Syndrome - Coronavirus - Type - 2 ; VNT : virus neutralization 55 test . T - cells : T - lymphocytes ; ELISpot - test : Enzyme - Linked - Immuno - Spot - test ; COI : cutoff index 56 4 Background 57 During the SARS - CoV - 2 ( S evere - A cute - R espiratory - S yndrome - Co rona V irus - Type - 2 ) - pandemic , 58 serological tests were used to detect SARS - CoV - 2 asymptomatic infection , thus providing additional 59 information about virus prevalence [ 1 ] . 60 The SARS - CoV - 2 structure proteins spike - glycoprotein ( S ) and nucleocapsid - protein ( N ) are immune 61 dominant . S - mediating the virus cell - entry - consists of subunits S1 with the receptor - binding - domain 62 ( RBD ) and S2 , responsible for virus replication . Whereas S1 - and N - antibodies are specific and 63 sensitive for SARS - CoV - 2 , S2 - antibodies are judged less appropriate to describe the immune response 64 [ 2 ] due to its high sequence homology with the seasonal “common cold” CoVs and thus cross - 65 reactivity . N is used to differentiate immune responses triggered by previous infection from those 66 triggered by vaccination , as vector vaccines only contains the spike protein . S1 is assumed to represent 67 the target for neutralizing antibodies ( NAbs ) elicited by currently used vaccines [ 3 ] . 68 Generally , specific immune - globulins ( Ig ) correlate with disease activity , possibly compromising 69 diagnostic accuracy [ 4 ] . IgA and - M represent an early defense line within a virus - related immune 70 response before generation of specific IgG or T - lymphocytes ( T - cells ) [ 5 ] , and rise three to six days 71 after onset of COVID - 19 - typical symptoms [ 5 – 7 ] up to a maximum approximately six weeks after 72 infection . RBD - specific IgM starts to decrease ~ 60 days after symptoms to a low level of 22 % [ 8 ] . In 73 contrast , IgG - antibodies can be detected over several months . N - specific IgG was observed to decrease 74 120 days after infection onset to 15 % , while S - specific IgG rests at a 80 % - level in parallel to avidity 75 maturation and presence of NAbs [ 8 ] . 76 As a special challenge for diagnostic , antibody titers in children and adolescents ( 5 - 21 years ) with 77 SARS - CoV - 2 - infection were shown to be low compared to adults , even though 92 . 3 % of these 78 children produced NAbs [ 9 ] . A lower immune response was also reported for seniors aged 60 + 79 years [ 10 ] . After vaccination , an S - and RBD - specific antibody reaction is expected , but protection 80 level are not yet defined [ 11 , 12 ] . Different test principles are available for SARS - CoV - 2 antibody 81 testing with a possible impact on test performance [ 13 ] . Crucial parameters are the recombinant virus 82 antigen , the targeted Ig - class , and the sensitivity of the respective biotechnological principle used [ 14 ] . 83 5 Objectives 84 Antibody screening was critical during SARS - CoV - 2 - pandemic to identify recovered or successfully 85 vaccinated individuals in the general population including children and seniors . This study had two 86 objectives . The first aim was to show , which serological assay was most suitable to detect SARS - 87 CoV - 2 - specific antibodies after infection or vaccination in general : i ) electro - chemiluminescence 88 immunoassay from Roche Diagnostics ( detecting N - specific IgM - , IgG - antibodies ; well evaluated 89 before , e . g . [ 15 ] ) , ii ) microarray - based immunoassay from Viramed Biotech AG ( detecting S1 - , S2 - 90 and N - specific IgG - antibodies ) . Due to this , assay performance of these serological assays for 91 detecting virus - specific antibodies were evaluated using serum samples from 381 subjects , aged 6 - 99 92 years , who had either recovered from the disease or had been vaccinated and therefore should show 93 seroconversion . Since the very presence of virus - specific antibodies is not suitable to give insight 94 concerning an assumed immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 upon infection or vaccination , the study further 95 investigated possible correlations between S - and N - specific antibodies and the occurrence of 96 neutralizing antibodies ( NAbs ) and T - cell - reactivity . Thus , it should be investigated which of those 97 assays , best represents reality - the second aim of this study . 98 Study design 99 Antibody detection tests and initial assay verification 100 The electro - chemiluminescence immunoassay Elecsys® Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ( Roche Diagnostics , 101 “Roche - Test” ) detecting N - antigen - specific IgM / IgA - antibodies and the microarray - based enzyme 102 immunoassay Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ViraChip® IgG ( Viramed Biotech AG , “Viramed - Test” ) detecting 103 S1 - , S2 - and N - antigen - specific antibodies were used as described in supplemental material and 104 elsewhere [ 1 ] . 105 Roche - and Viramed - Test were initially evaluated regarding analytical sensitivity , specificity , and 106 interassay precision with the following verification samples : i ) 192 samples from German Red Cross 107 blood donation center in Lower Saxony , Germany ( collected before 2019 ) , ii ) 33 samples of SARS - 108 CoV - 2 - antibody - positive persons after polymerase - chain - reaction ( PCR ) - confirmation ( classified 109 6 using Roche - Test ) from Medical Care Center ( MVZ ) - Labor Dr . Limbach in Heidelberg , Germany , and 110 iii ) 30 samples of SARS - CoV - 2 - antibody - tested persons ( classified using LIAISON SARS - CoV - 2 111 S1 / S2 IgG assay , DiaSorin ; 12 positive , PCR - confirmed / 18 negative samples ) from MVZ - Labor 112 Limbach , Lehrte , Germany . In three independent measurements 47 samples ( 18 positively classified 113 samples , 29 negatively classified samples ) were analyzed . Assay verification of both tests met 114 acceptance criteria , since more than 93 % of samples were correctly detected ( Table S1 , detailed 115 Viramed - Test results for each antigen in Table S2 ) . 116 ELISpot - test for T - cell - reactivity and test for virus - NAbs 117 Enzyme - Linked - Immuno - Spot ( ELISpot ) - test ( Immunospot , Cleveland , US ) was carried out in pre - 118 coated 96 - well plates ( Mabtech ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( supplement ) with a 119 response of > 15 SFU / 10 6 considered positive . Virus neutralization test ( VNT ) was also performed as 120 described before [ 16 , 1 , 17 ] . 121 Subject cohorts and ethics vote 122 Serum samples were collected in two large cohorts , subdivided into two subgroups each ( recovered 123 and vaccinated subjects ) . Figure 1 and Table S3 give an overview of all subgroups analyzed . Antibody 124 testing was offered to subjects at intervals of a few months . Clinical data were collected in a 125 pseudonymized form after informed consent in parallel to serum collection [ 1 , 18 ] . While fresh serum 126 was used for cohort 1 , in cohort 2 test - laboratory was not located close to blood collection site . 127 Therefore , after collection , frozen samples were brought to the laboratory , and had to be thawed 128 overnight at 4°C before testing . 129 Serum samples of cohort 1 were collected during an open observational study in Lower Saxony , 130 Germany , between August 2020 and June 2021 [ 1 ] . No study subject has given information on known 131 immune dysfunctions and / or taking immunosuppressant drugs ( Table S4 ) . Subgroup 1 consisted of 132 57 subjects , recovered after a PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( predominantly the B . 1 . 617 . 2 133 variant , determined by PCR melting curve analysis using the VirSNiP SARS - CoV - 2 Spike Kits 484A 134 486V ( Delta ) as well as S371L S373P ( BA1 and BA2 ) from Tib MolBiol ( Berlin , Germany ) ) , and 135 subgroup 2 included 140 subjects , that were analyzed after first shot of vaccination ( Biontech / Pfizer : 136 7 120 , Moderna : 3 , AstraZeneca : 17 ) [ 19 ] . Since sample collection was scheduled in advance and 137 vaccination was often performed spontaneously ( especially during the early stages of vaccine 138 availability ) , there was no set period between vaccination and serum collection . Within subgroup 1 139 and 2 , 30 subjects were tested twice for seroconversion . VNT - and ELISpot - tests were performed in 140 recovered ( n VNT = 56 ; n ELISpot = 45 ) and vaccinated subjects ( n VNT = 36 ; n ELISpot = 88 ) with 141 seroconversion . 142 Cohort 2 included 1180 pupils aged 6 - 17 years , but also parents , and teachers , out of a longitudinal 143 study in Hannover , Germany , between June 2020 and June 2021 [ 18 ] . Subgroup 3 consisted of 19 144 recovered subjects , subgroup 4 consisted of 165 subjects , among those 56 pupils aged 6 - 17 years , 145 analyzed after first shot of vaccination with Biontech / Pfizer . Here , no subjects in subgroup 3 and 4 146 provided more than one serum sample . 147 Ethical approval was given for cohort 1 by ”Aerztekammer Niedersachsen” in August 2020 148 ( No . Bo / 30 / 2020 ; Bo / 31 / 2020 ; Bo / 32 / 2020 ; amendment for the vaccinated subjects in November 149 2021 ) , for cohort 2 by Institutional Review Board of the Medical School Hannover 150 ( No . 9085 _ BO _ S _ 2020 ) . 151 Statistical methods 152 Descriptive statistics are indicated . Wilcoxon ranked test was used to compare negative and positive 153 samples of different age groups and groups sorted by time point of diagnosis as well as for age - and 154 time - point - sorted groups of negatively and positively tested subjects as indicated with p < 0 . 05 for 155 significance . 156 157 8 158 Figure 1 : Schematic displaying subjects and samples classified into two cohorts and four subgroups based on their study affiliation and recovered or vaccination status . For this study 159 ( rectangular frames ) , either 110 samples from 76 not - vaccinated subjects with PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( subgroups 1 & 3 , highlighted orange ) or 312 samples from 305 vaccinated 160 subjects without PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( subgroups 2 & 4 , highlighted blue ) were considered for subgroups . Details for exclusion from evaluation ( dropout , grey bubbles ) : 161 27 subjects with a positive PCR - test did not participate in antibody screening ; samples from subjects which had a PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection and at least one shot of vaccine at date of 162 sample collection ; samples from not - vaccinated subjects without PCR - confirmed infection . 163 9 Results 164 Analyzing 110 serum samples of 76 recovered subjects ( subgroup 1 : 57 subjects ; subgroup 3 : 165 19 subjects ) , the assays detected antibodies in all samples ( Viramed - Test : 98 cases ; Roche - Test : 91 166 cases ) . Both tests detected evidence of seroconversion between 7 - 400 days following initial positive 167 PCR - test . N - specific seroconversion in recovered subjects was detected solely with N - specific Roche - 168 Test until day 119 and solely with an S - specific Viramed - result until day 154 . In contrast , a consistent 169 positive test result was present until day 400 ( Figures 2 , 3 ) . The time - point of test performance was 170 highly significant for classification of result : negative results according to Roche - Tests ( n = 19 ) were 171 obtained at 76 . 8 ± 65 . 9 days after PCR - confirmed infection ( Figure S1 ) , positive Roche - results ( n = 91 ) 172 were measured significantly later ( Figure 2 ) ( p < 0 . 001 according to Wilcoxon ) at 111 . 6 ± 76 . 6 days 173 after infection . According to Viramed - Test , negative results ( n = 12 ) were found significantly earlier at 174 55 . 8±45 . 5 days after a confirming PCR ( Figure S1 ) than the 98 positive Viramed - results at 111 . 6±76 . 5 175 days after infection ( p < 0 . 001 according to Wilcoxon ) ( Figure 2 ) . Although Roche - Test also covers 176 IgA and IgM , there was no significant difference in time - dependent test performance between the tests 177 ( not shown ) . Viramed - Test , which includes N - and S - specific antibodies , was even found to detect 178 seroconversion as early as Roche ( Figure 2 , tests indicated by different symbols ) . 179 180 Figure 2 : All test results of both antibody tests in a time interval ( in days ) after PCR - confirmation of a SARS - CoV - 2 181 infection . Red dots symbolize negative test results in both tests , grey dots positive results in both tests , triangles symbolize 182 samples tested positive only with the Viramed - Test , and squares symbolize positive test results gained only with the Roche - 183 10 Test . Arrow lines connect samples from two subjects that were initially tested negative with both test systems . However , both 184 subjects displayed seroconversion during later tests . The six additional samples that tested negative with both test systems 185 were obtained from subjects without additional samples provided . 186 Both tests displayed a comparable result in very young ( 6 - 12 years ) and juvenile subjects ( 12 - 17 187 years ) . In middle - aged subjects ( 18 - 60 years ) and subjects aged 60 + years , Viramed detected 188 seroconversion more often than Roche ( Figure 3 ) . Viramed - Test identified seroconversion in age 189 group 60 + years up to day 154 after immunization ; seroconversion here occurred significantly earlier 190 at 72 . 3 ± 40 . 0 days after PCR - confirmation than in all other tested subjects ( 123 . 81 ± 80 . 9 days ; 191 p < 0 . 003 according to Wilcoxon ) . 192 193 Figure 3 : Age dependency of antibody detection in subjects with a PCR - confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Age groups 194 comprise 6 - 12 years , 13 - 17 years , 18 to 60 years , and over 60 years . They were sorted by the test used ( Viramed or Roche ) . 195 The number of positive samples out of all samples tested in each age group is indicated . 196 Viramed - Test identified a seroconversion in 252 / 305 vaccinated subjects of subgroups 2 and 4 ( Figure 197 4 ) . In juvenile subjects up to 17 years , immune response occurred significantly earlier than expected 198 ( day 4 - 66 after vaccination , p < 0 . 01 according to Wilcoxon ) than in all other groups ( Figure 5 ) . In the 199 juvenile group , 13 / 42 samples were tested negative , whereas this was the case in 35 / 231 samples of 200 middle - aged subjects and only 6 / 39 samples in group 60 + years . 201 11 202 Figure 4 : Time of test performance after the first shot of vaccination of the Viramed - Tests , with positive detection of 203 S1 / S2 - specific antibodies until day 160 . The colored area depicts the time interval in which , at least for Biontech - 204 vaccinated , no humoral immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein was expected ( until day 14 after first vaccination ) [ 19 ] . 205 Distributed all over the age groups , there were samples with a negative test result belonging to 13 different subjects ( age 206 range 18 - 86 years , median 47 years ) after this 14 day interval . The two samples connected by an arrow indicate results of a 207 subject that was initially tested negative but showed seroconversion at a later test . 208 209 Figure 5 : Age group - sorted positive Viramed - Test results ( S1 / S2 - specific antibodies after first shot of vaccination ) . 210 The colored area depicts the time interval in which , at least for Biontech - vaccinated , no seroconversion was expected ( until 211 day 14 after first vaccination ) [ 19 ] . 212 Most of the negative samples of vaccinated subjects aged 13 - 60 years were collected predominantly in 213 a very early time interval , in which seroconversion after vaccination could not be expected [ 19 ] . In 214 contrast , negative test results were observed for older subjects 60 + years , in a time interval up to 44 215 days after the first shot of vaccination ( Figure S2 ) . Negative Viramed - Test results were observed early 216 in 8 . 8 % of all recovered 60 + years individuals and later in recovered middle - aged subjects ( 17 . 9 % ; 217 12 Figure S1 ) . Negative results of N - specific Roche - Test were obtained in 16 . 2 % of middle - aged and 218 25 % of 60 + year subjects . A non - responder was observed out of eight subjects younger than 12 years 219 with negative results in both tests 106 days after positive PCR . Above these observations , there was no 220 significant influence of the factor age on the classification of results according to Wilcoxon ( results 221 not shown ) . We observed eight non - responders after infection and 13 non - responders after vaccination 222 with antibody detection performed at least 14 days after the first vaccination shot ( Table S5 ) . In 223 addition , a Cohens´ kappa correlation test indicating interrater - reliability between the different assays 224 revealed a value of only 0 . 4 among all samples of all cohorts tested in this work . 225 Whether or not a positive result of either Viramed - or Roche - Test indicates a possible SARS - CoV - 2 - 226 immunity by either infection or vaccination was tested upon determination of NAbs and T - cell - 227 reactivity in seroconverted subjects of cohort 1 ; among those 73 subjects tested positive with Viramed 228 ( 41 recovered , 32 vaccinated ) , and 38 recovered subjects tested positive with Roche ( Table 1 ) . 229 Generally , T - cell - reactivity was present 15 - 302 days after immunization , and NAbs occurred 7 - 400 230 days ( not shown ) . Depending on age , between 75 % and 82 % of all samples from these Viramed - 231 defined 73 seroconverted subjects were positive for T - cell - reactivity , and above 90 % were positive for 232 NAbs ( Table 1 and 2 ) . S - specific antibodies were detected in 70 / 73 subjects , and 3 / 73 had solely N - 233 specific antibodies according to Viramed - Test . Again , depending on age , Roche - Test recognized 234 78 - 90 % of recovered subjects with signs of T - cell - reactivity and > 92 % of subjects with NAbs . 235 Detection of a full pattern with N - , S1 - , and S2 - specific antibodies by the Viramed - Test more often 236 correlated with T - cell - reactivity than with NAbs and was more frequent in subjects over 18 years 237 ( Table 2 ) . 238 Table 1 : 36 respective 32 either recovered or vaccinated subjects with comparable age structure were identified as 239 seroconverted by antibody tests and were also tested by ELISpot for possible T - lymphocyte ( T - cell ) reactivity against 240 SARS - CoV - 2 and for Nabs ( virus neutralization test , VNT ) . n . a . : not available ( vaccination does not trigger N - antibody 241 production ) . 242 Status Both assays Viramed Roche Number ( subjects ) T - cell - reactivity VNT Number ( subjects ) T - cell - reactivity VNT Number ( subjects ) T - cell - reactivity VNT Recovered 36 80 . 56 % 97 . 22 % 41 78 . 05 % 90 . 24 % 38 73 . 17 % 94 . 74 % Age [ years ] ( median ; range ) 51 ; 22 - 99 52 ; 22 - 99 53 ; 22 - 99 Vaccinated 32 81 . 25 % 93 . 75 % 32 81 . 25 % 93 . 75 % n . a . n . a . n . a .

In ten recovered subjects , this divergence persisted across all serum samples 249 taken over time ( Table S6 ) , whereas in the other subjects , this divergence did not reappear in later 250 analyses . Among the former , there were two subjects with no seroconversion according to Roche - Test 251 ( no N - specific antibodies ) . These also had no NAbs and one subject showed no signs of T - cell - 252 reactivity . 7 / 8 subjects with a negative Viramed - Test but a positive Roche - Test for N - specific 253 antibodies had positive VNTs , and 6 / 8 also had a positive T - cell - test . 254 Discussion 255 Altogether , this study showed comparatively higher sensitivity and specificity for both assays than 256 reported by other groups [ 20 – 23 ] . For Viramed - Test , this could be caused by the larger cohorts 257 presented here compared to previously reported collectives . Interassay precision of Viramed - Test was 258 comparably lower than of Roche - Test . The comparably more sensitive Roche - Test correlated better 259 with positive NAbs results in a number of subjects tested , but Viramed - Test - also detecting S - specific 260 antibodies - was highly associated with T - cell - reactivity [ 24 ] . 261 14 Divergences concerning N - antibody detection were observed in 31 % of all samples from recovered 262 subjects . False - negative results of Viramed - Test may be due to the fact , that this test covers only IgG , 263 not IgM or IgA . Another cause for this could be the different molecular technology principles used in 264 the assays . The antigen of interest is initially free in solution in Roche - Test , whereas it is immobilized 265 in Viramed - Test with a possible negative impact on its conformation and binding capacity of 266 antibodies and thus test sensitivity . In all , we found more cases with only S - positivity than only N - 267 positivity in Viramed - Test after infection ; thus we assume this antibody signature as more 268 sustainable [ 25 ] . 269 The assays perform relatively equally in different age groups and time intervals after infection . Since 270 detection windows were the same for both tests presented here , we can underline the observation of 271 others that assays detecting also IgM and IgA have no added value for early diagnosis [ 26 ] . Possibly , 272 due to its broader antigen - specificity , Viramed - Test detected seroconversion in more subjects than 273 Roche - Test . According to Cohens´s kappa value , the interassay correlation was low at 0 . 4 , which is 274 explainable by the different immune globulin classes and antibody specificities covered by these two 275 tests . In addition , this low correlation value confirms the observation of others that occurrence of N - 276 and S - specific antibodies , as well as IgM and IgG , show high inter - subject differences after 277 SARS - CoV - 2 - infection [ 8 ] . 278 A limitation but also an opportunity is the random driven design of the presented study as part of an 279 open observational study as well as of a longitudinal study . Subjects at different affiliations were 280 invited for regular , voluntary PCR - tests [ 1 , 18 ] . Later on subjects participating the PCR - tests were 281 invited for voluntary antibody - screenings at least at two different time points . As summarized in 282 Figure 1 3218 / 7280 subjects did not participate in the antibody - screening . Especially in the first month 283 of SARS - CoV - 2 - pandemic the number of PCR - confirmed infections was low and thus the number of 284 recovered subjects in this study was 76 ( subgroup 1 : 57 subjects ; subgroup 3 : 19 subjects ) . 285 Furthermore , only 30 subjects in subgroup 1 and 2 and no subjects in subgroup 3 and 4 were tested 286 more than once for seroconversion ( Table S3 ) , resulting in a total of 110 serum samples of 76 287 recovered subjects . But there was no standardized time period between sample collections throughout 288 15 the study . Since sample collection was scheduled in advance and vaccination was often performed 289 spontaneously ( especially during the early stages of vaccine availability ) , there also was no set period 290 between vaccination and serum collection . This increased variety of subjects and samples of this 291 study . Due to the design of the longitudinal study at different schools ( cohort 2 ) no VNT and ELISpot - 292 tests were performed with samples of subgroups 3 and 4 , thus this study is lacking assumptions to 293 immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 especially for children . 294 As expected , negative tests were obtained significantly earlier than positive tests , consistent with the 295 period in which humoral immunity builds based on activation of virus - specific B - lymphocytes after 296 SARS - CoV - 2 - infection . Of note , recovered subjects aged 60 + years had the fastest humoral immune 297 response , but its sustainability is unclear , since these subjects received vaccine before further immune 298 analyses could be performed . However , negative test results were observed until day 44 after infection 299 in this age group , which may reflect immunosenescence ( 6 ) . S - antibodies occurred comparatively 300 earlier than N - specific antibodies in recovered subjects of all cohorts described in this work . 301 Viramed - Test performance detected seroconversion after vaccination within the expected periods [ 19 ] . 302 Of note , juvenile vaccinated subjects showed seroconversion already within the first days after 303 receiving first vaccine dose . 304 Antibody screening tests such as those presented here are often taken as possible predictors of general 305 immunity . Therefore , we correlated antibody assays with VNT - results and ELISpot - testing in a 306 subgroup analysis . ELISpot - testing does not reflect T - cell - subtypes and thus the precise quality of the 307 immune response . Our observations of late NAbs coincide with a study by McCallum et al . [ 27 ] , who 308 described diverse antibodies derived from memory - B - cells interacting with the S - protein of 309 SARS - CoV - 2 . S - specific antibodies also show a high timely correlation with T - cell - reactivity [ 24 ] . 310 Although others have shown that N - specific antibodies drop down early within months [ 28 ] , our 311 results showed detectable N - specific antibodies up to 400 days after infection . N - specific antibodies 312 ( detected by Roche - Test ) occurred in parallel to S1 - specific antibodies ( detected by Viramed - Test ) 313 and to NAbs , that are presumably represented by these S1 - specific antibodies [ 8 ] . 314 16 In conclusion , we recommend a complete analysis using antibody screening tests covering all antigen - 315 specificities to be able to i ) recognize seroconversion early after infection or vaccination , ii ) 316 distinguish solely vaccinated from recovered and vaccinated subjects , and iii ) have a high probability 317 of predicting sustainable immunity . The Viramed - Test evaluation presented in this work meets this 318 recommendation . 319 Acknowledgment 320 A big thank you goes to Dr .

Additionally , results of Viramed - Test were 352 divided in negative ( < 69 ViraChip units ) , borderline ( 69 - 99 ViraChip units ) and positive ( ≥ 100 353 ViraChip units ) . Seropositivity was declared when at least one of the IgG - antibodies against S1 - , S2 - 354 or N - antigen were verifiable above the detection limit [ 1 ] . In case of a borderline result , analysis was 355 repeated once . According to the manufacturer’s recommendation , for both assays borderline and 356 positive test results were categorized as positive . In this study only samples of either recovered ( PCR - 357 confirmed ) or vaccinated subjects were analyzed , which therefore should be positive for virus - specific 358 antibodies . Samples from subjects both recovered from a SARS - CoV - 2 infection and vaccinated at the 359 time of specimen collection as well as samples from not - vaccinated subjects without PCR - confirmed 360 infection were not considered further in the evaluation and are not accounted for in any of the four 361 subgroups ( Figure 1 , dropout ) . 362 Detailed performance of IFN - g - ELISpot to analyze S - specific T - cell reactivity 363 Briefly , frozen PBMCs were thawed and 2 . 5x105 PBMCs seeded in triplicate with overlapping 364 peptides covering the whole S sequence aa residues 1 - 1273 ( Genscript , RP30027 , Protein ID : 365 P0DTC2 ) ; ( 0 . 7 µg / ml ; 15 mer overlapped by 11 ) . DMSO and anti - CD3 were as negative and positive 366 control , respectively . After overnight incubation plates were developed and spots counted using the 367 ImunoSpot S6 ( CTL ) . Data were expressed as spot - forming units per million of PBMCs after 368 subtraction of the DMSO control . 369 Quality assurance in laboratory 370 Sample collection , treatment , and analysis were performed according to the guideline of the German 371 Medical Association for quality assurance of examinations in laboratory medicine 2019 . Here , in both 372 test methods , negative and positive controls were used before ( Elecsys® Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ) and 373 19 during test performance ( Elecsys® Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 and Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ViraChip® IgG test 374 kit ) , while no more than 16 hours lay in between the measurements of controls for Elecsys® Anti - 375 SARS - CoV - 2 . 376 377 Supplement Tables 378 Table S1 : Analytical sensitivity , specificity examined using 255 clearly classified verification samples and interassay 379 precision using 46 of those classified samples . Interassay precision and validity were lower in the Viramed - Test due to 380 reproducible false - negative and false - positive results of samples ( 1 / 45 respective 2 / 210 ) . In contrast , Roche - Test only showed 381 one false - negative result in 45 positive samples . 382 Assay sensitivity [ % ] Assay specificity [ % ] Total interassay precision [ % ] Interassay precision ( positive results ) [ % ] Interassay precision ( negative results ) [ % ] Elecsys® Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 IgM , IgA , IgG for antibodies against N antigen ( Roche - Test ) 100 . 0 100 . 0 99 . 3 ± 8 , 5 98 . 1 ± 13 . 6 100 . 0 Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ViraChip® IgG for antibodies against S1 , S2 , N antigens ( Viramed - Test ) 97 . 8 99 . 0 93 . 6 ± 24 . 5 94 . 4 ± 23 . 1 93 . 1 ± 25 . 5 383 Table S2 : Key figures such as sensitivity and specificity of the Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ViraChip® IgG ( Viramed - ) test 384 defined for each antigen ( S1 , S2 , N ) separately . 385 Antigen specificity of antibodies tested S1 S2 N Sensitivity of Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ViraChip® IgG test [ % ] 93 . 3 64 . 8 95 . 6 Specificity of Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ViraChip® IgG test [ % ] 99 . 5 100 . 0 99 . 5 386 Table S3 : Detailed subject information for cohort 1 , divided in subgroup 1 ( recovered ) and subgroup 2 ( vaccinated ) , 387 and cohort 2 , divided in subgroup 3 ( recovered ) and subgroup 4 ( vaccinated ) .
