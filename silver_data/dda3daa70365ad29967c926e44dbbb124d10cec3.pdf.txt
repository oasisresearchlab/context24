This disease is highlighted by systemic in ﬂ ammation in affected organs and by high comorbidity with immune - mediated diseases . Results : We provide genomic evidence to support the recognition of endometriosis as an in ﬂ ammatory systemic disease . This was achieved through our genomics - led target prioritization , called ‘ END ’ , that leverages the value of multi - layered genomic datasets ( including genome - wide associations in disease , regulatory genomics , and protein interactome ) .

Keywords : endometriosis , in ﬂ ammatory systemic disease , therapeutic target prioritization , drug repurposing , neutrophil degranulation INTRODUCTION Endometriosis , characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial - like tissues , is classically viewed as a chronic hormone dependent neuroin ﬂ ammatory disease locally restricted to the pelvis ( 1 ) . Endometriosis is estimated to be present in 50 – 80 % of women with pelvic pain , and occurs in up to 50 % of women with infertility ( 2 , 3 ) . Clinical manifestations are varied , with high prevalence ( affecting 5 - 10 % of reproductive - age women with negative impacts on quality of life ) , common misdiagnosis ( 65 % of women initially misdiagnosed ) or diagnostic delay ( delayed by 4 - 11 years ) . Currently , endometriosis is increasingly recognized as a systemic disease with multi - organ effects throughout the body [ reviewed in ( 4 ) ] . The full effects are far from clear , but consensus has been reached that patients with endometriosis are likely to have : ( i ) adipocyte and hepatic metabolic changes , such as low body mass index ( 5 ) ; ( ii ) neurological alterations that enhance pain sensitivity and increase the risk of developing mood disorders , such as fatigue , depression and anxiety ( 6 ) ; ( iii ) systemic in ﬂ ammation that causes widespread in ﬂ ammatory - like microenvironments in affected tissues or organs ( 7 ) ; and ( iv ) the tendency to develop immune - mediated diseases ( 8 ) . Likely due to the complexity of systemic effects and disease comorbidities described above , there is currently no cure for endometriosis . Available treatments help to reduce symptoms and maintain quality of life . Two treatment options ( medical and surgical therapies ) are mainly for alleviating endometriosis - associated pain ( 4 ) . Medical therapy , combining oral contraceptives ( or progestins ) and non - steroidal anti - in ﬂ ammatory drugs ( known as ‘ NSAIDs ’ ) , represents the ﬁ rst - line therapy . On average , 25 - 33 % of patients do not respond to ﬁ rst - line therapies . For non - responders with persistent pain , gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) analogs or aromatase inhibitors represent the second - line therapy . Surgical therapy aims to treat pain and disease - related infertility as well . Medical therapy following surgery represents the third - line therapy that is supposed to reduce or minimize disease recurrence and systemic effects . It should be noted , however , that neither medical therapy nor surgery fully addresses the systemic nature of the disease . Recognizing endometriosis as a systemic disease highlights the importance of new target identi ﬁ cation and validation to increase the range of medical therapies , ultimately for better therapeutics . The etiopathogenesis of endometriosis is complex , involving the interplay between genetic inheritance and environmental in ﬂ uence . Genetic associations arising from genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) provide a rich source of genetic targets . For example , GWAS meta - analysis in endometriosis has identi ﬁ ed disease risk loci that are likely to affect genes involved in hormone metabolism ( 9 ) . Such genetic evidence is critical for successful therapeutic development ( 10 , 11 ) . How to harness GWAS ﬁ ndings for use in drug discovery ( 12 ) and drug repurposing ( 13 ) , however , requires a paradigm change in strategies . Recently , we have proposed a strategic framework that generalizes how to establish the link from genetic loci to modulated genes that can be further linked to drug targets ( 14 , 15 ) . Our advocates of genetic target prioritization have driven this ﬁ eld of research ( 16 – 22 ) . In this study , we extended this into genomics - led target prioritization ( called ‘ END ’ ) and demonstrated better performance than the status quo approaches ( Figure 1 ) , with the aim of providing genomic evidence for endometriosis as an in ﬂ ammatory systemic disease . Our genomic prioritization , followed by a range of integrative bioinformatics analyses ( including comparisons with immune diseases ) , enabled us to identify repurposing opportunities for existing immunomodulatory drugs and more importantly , to reveal therapeutic strategies for endometriosis - speci ﬁ c targeting . In a wider context , our study provides a new strategy to advance the use of human genetics and genomics for target identi ﬁ cation and validation in in ﬂ ammatory systemic diseases . MATERIALS AND METHODS Genomics - Led Prioritization and Performance Evaluation The steps designed for genomic prioritization and evaluation were brie ﬂ y described in Figure 1 and detailed below . Step 1 : Preparing Genomic Predictors We extended our previous pipeline ( 23 ) to prepare genomic predictors utilizing multi - layered genomic datasets and the knowledge of gene / protein interactions . Genomic datasets included : ( i ) GWAS summary statistics in endometriosis ( 9 , 24 – 27 ) , considering a typical threshold ( P - values < 5×10 − 8 ) and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium ( R 2 < 0 . 8 ) according to the European population ( 28 ) to de ﬁ ne nearby genes ( nGene ) ; ( ii ) promoter capture Hi - C ( 29 – 34 ) , de ﬁ ning conformation genes Bao et al . Genomics - Led Target Prioritization in Endometriosis Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 758440 2 ( cGene ) ; and ( iii ) eQTL ( 35 – 41 ) , de ﬁ ning expression genes ( eGene ) . The knowledge of gene / protein interactions was obtained from the STRING database ( high - quality , only with evidence codes ‘ experiments ’ or ‘ databases ’ ) ( 42 ) , corresponding to a total of 14 , 325 target genes considered for prioritization ( Table S1 ) . Step 2 : Evaluating Predictor Importance We applied random forest ( 43 ) to evaluate predictor importance . Considering the fact that the nGene predictor is conventionally used ( thus treated as the baseline ) , only cGene and eGene predictors that were no less important / informative than nGene remained for the subsequent combination . Step 3 : Combining Predictors We combined informative predictors for in silico prioritization . For a candidate target gene , strategies that combine individual predictors could be either direct or indirect . The direct combinations can be sum ( summing up af ﬁ nity scores ) , max ( taking the maximum ) or harmonic ( using the harmonic sum ) , while the idea of indirect combinations is to ﬁ rst transform af ﬁ nity scores into P - values and then combined via meta - analysis methods such as Fisher ’ s , logistic or order statistic . Performance for combination strategies was measured by the area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) separating clinical proof - of - concept targets in endometriosis from simulated controls . Existing proof - of - concept targets in endometriosis were de ﬁ ned as therapeutic target genes of drugs reaching development phase 2 and above [ sourced from the ChEMBL database ( 44 ) ] . Step 4 : Benchmarking Prioritization Approaches We benchmarked competing approaches for performance evaluation . Benchmarking was also based on AUC ( that is , separating clinical proof - of - concept targets in endometriosis from simulated controls ) to compare the performance of ‘ END ’ ( this study ) , ‘ Naïve ’ ( an approach prioritizing a gene by how often it has been targeted by existing drugs ) , and ‘ Open Targets ’ ( using the harmonic sum to aggregate individual evidence except for the information on known drugs ) ( 45 ) . Target Set Enrichment Analysis The dnet package ( 46 ) was used to conduct target set enrichment analysis quantifying the degree to which a prede ﬁ ned gene list is enriched at the leading prioritization . The leading prioritization , visually de ﬁ ned as the left - most region of the peak in running enrichment plot , is the core subset of the prioritized target genes accounting for the enrichment signal . The analysis was applied to clinical proof - of - concept targets in endometriosis , showing that they tended to be highly ranked . This analysis was also applied to : ( i ) cell - type - speci ﬁ c gene signatures ( 47 ) for exploring the FIGURE 1 | Overview of genomics - led target prioritization in endometriosis ( called ‘ END ’ ) . Steps 1 - 3 sequentially describe how to prepare , evaluate and combine genomic predictors for in silico target prioritization . The key is the preparation of genomic predictors at Step 1 , as illustrated on the right , utilizing genetic associations in disease , regulatory genomics ( mainly promoter - capture Hi - C datasets and eQTL datasets ) and the knowledge of gene / protein interactions . Step 4 is intended for benchmarking to compare the performance of END with two competing prioritization approaches , including Naïve ( a gene prioritized simply according to how often the gene is already targeted by existing drugs ) and Open Targets ( without utilizing the information of known drug targets ) . GWAS , genome - wide association studies ; nGene , nearby genes ; cGene , conformation genes ; eGene , expression genes . Bao et al . Genomics - Led Target Prioritization in Endometriosis Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 758440 3 cellular basis of all prioritized target genes in endometriosis ; ( ii ) MSigDB hallmark gene sets ( 48 ) for revealing molecular hallmarks based on the top 10 % prioritized target genes in endometriosis ; and ( iii ) one ﬁ broblast gene expression signature speci ﬁ c to ectopic endometrium ( 49 ) and four gene expression signatures involving two endometriosis stages ( I / II and III / IV ) at two menstrual cycle phases ( proliferative and secretory ) ( 50 ) for examining the highly prioritized target gene expression . Pathway Crosstalk - Based Attack Analysis There were three steps to achieve this . First , the XGR package ( 51 ) and a collection of KEGG organismal system pathways ( 52 ) were used to identify enriched pathways based on the top 1 % prioritized genes . Second , pathway crosstalk was identi ﬁ ed by searching for a subset of gene interactions ( extracted from enriched pathways identi ﬁ ed in the previous step ) ; identi ﬁ ed so in a manner that the resulting pathway crosstalk contained highly prioritized and interconnected genes ( 53 ) . Third , attack analysis was conducted to select optimal targeting combinations that maximized the effect of removing nodes on the crosstalk ; done so in a manner to maximize the effect of removing either single nodes or speci ﬁ c node combinations . The combinatorial node removal can be 2 - node combinations removed in the context of a ﬁ xed node ‘ ATK1 ’ , and 3 - node combinations removed in the context of two ﬁ xed nodes ‘ AKT1 + ESR1 ’ . Construction of Cross - Disease Prioritization Map Focusing on the top 5 % prioritized target genes ( n = 689 ) in endometriosis , the supraHex package ( 54 ) was used to construct cross - disease prioritization map . In brief , a supra - hexagonal map , consisting of 91 hexagons , was trained by the prioritization matrix ( containing priority ratings ) of 689 target genes versus 7 diseases including endometriosis ( this study ) and 6 immune - mediated diseases ( 53 ) . These immune diseases include : ( i ) in ﬂ ammatory bowel diseases , subdivided into Crohn ’ s disease ( CRO ) and ulcerative colitis ( UC ) ; and ( ii ) in ﬂ ammatory systemic diseases , including multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , Sjögren ’ s syndrome ( SJO ) , and systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . The trained map was used to illustrate a gene prioritization pro ﬁ le per disease , and together with a consensus neighbour - joining tree built from the prioritization matrix , to further illustrate inter - disease relationships . The trained map was also divided into target gene clusters in a topology - preserving manner . Enrichment analysis for genes within a cluster was based on one - sided Fisher ’ s exact test to identify enrichments in terms of : ( i ) approved drug targets obtained from the ChEMBL database ( 44 ) ; ( ii ) immune system pathways from the Reactome database ( 55 ) ; ( iii ) Gene Ontology functional annotations from NCBI ( 56 ) ; and ( iv ) mouse phenotype annotations using Mammalian Phenotype Ontology ( 57 ) . Identi ﬁ cation of Druggable Pockets The fpocket software ( 58 ) was used to predict druggable pockets of a target gene based on its known protein structure ( s ) . The known protein structures were obtained from the PDB database ( 59 ) , for example , the access code ‘ 4N78 ’ for the WAVE regulatory complex ( 60 ) . A gene was de ﬁ ned to be tractable if predicted to have drug - like binding sites ( that is , druggable pockets ) . The PDB structure was viewed in 3D as cartoon ( secondary structure abstraction ) , colored by PDB chains and embedded with druggable pockets in blue ( 61 ) . RESULTS Leveraging Genomic Predictors for In Silico Prioritization of Therapeutic Targets in Endometriosis We performed genomics - led prioritization , taking GWAS summary statistics in endometriosis as inputs and leveraging the informativeness of regulatory genomics in diverse cell types , activation states and tissues . As outlined in Figure 1 ( see Materials and Methods for details ) , our multi - step prioritization process consisted of : ( i ) the preparation of genomic predictors ; ( ii ) the evaluation of predictor importance to identify informative predictors ; ( iii ) the assessment of how to combine informative predictors ; and ( iv ) performance evaluation to benchmark competing approaches . We found that using the meta - analysis - like combination strategy , particularly based on order statistic to combine genomic predictors , achieved much better performance than using the direct combination strategy ( Figure 2A ) . Benchmarking results showed that our prioritization approach ( called ‘ END ’ ) was superior to competing approaches ( Figure 2B ) . We considered two competing approaches , namely , Open Targets ( also using genetics and genomics for target identi ﬁ cation and prioritization ) ( 45 ) and Naïve prioritization ( prioritizing a gene by how often it has been targeted by existing drugs ) , that were similar in performance . Notably , Naïve prioritization , based on the concept of drug repurposing , was limited in being unable to predict new targets . The precision - recall analysis showed that our prioritization achieved the 91 % precision at the 56 % recall ( prioritization coverage ; Figure 2C ) . We prioritized a total of > 14 , 000 candidate target genes [ with the knowledge of gene interactions sourced from the STRING database ( 42 ) ] , ranked by priority rating ( Table S1 ) . The top prioritized targets included genes essential in in ﬂ ammation and cellular responses , such as JUN ( ranked 1 st ) , NFKB1 ( 12 th ) , RUNX1 ( 17 th ) , PTEN ( 21 st ) , MAPK14 ( 24 th ) , FOS ( 20 th ) , SMAD3 ( 22 nd ) , and RELA ( 25 th ) ( Figure 3A ) . Our prioritization recovered existing clinical proof - of - concept target genes in endometriosis ( Figures 3B , C ) . These proof - of - concept targets in endometriosis were all at the top 1 % prioritized gene list , including : MAPK8 ( 9 th ) , MAPK10 ( 46 th ) , and MAPK9 ( 47 th ) targeted by bentamapimod , a JNK inhibitor ; ESR1 ( 19 th ) targeted by estradiol , an estrogen receptor ( ER ) alpha agonist ; ESR2 ( 99 th ) targeted by prinaberel , an ER beta agonist ; AR ( 26 th ) targeted by danazol , an androgen receptor ( AR ) agonist , and cyproterone acetate , an AR antagonist ; NR3C1 ( 53 th ) targeted by cyproterone acetate and mifepristone , two glucocorticoid receptor antagonists ; NGF ( 91 th ) targeted by tanezumab , a beta - nerve growth factor inhibitor ; PGR ( 116 th ) targeted by selective Bao et al . Genomics - Led Target Prioritization in Endometriosis Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 758440 4 progesterone receptor modulators ( SPRMs ) ; and TNF ( 136 th ) targeted by in ﬂ iximab , a TNF - alpha inhibitor . According to the latest ESHIR guideline ( 62 ) , SPRMs such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and levonorgestrel are highly recommended to reduce endometriosis - associated pain , and norethindrone acetate ( alongside GnRH ) highly recommended to prevent bone loss and hypoestrogenic symptom , but no longer recommended for danazol . Figure 3C also provides a summary of the predictors used and their relative importance ( informativeness ) . We treated the nearby gene predictor as the baseline de ﬁ ning predictive informativeness . We identi ﬁ ed informative regulatory genomic predictors that were mostly derived from immune blood cells ( with a few from other cell types and tissues ) . These results necessitated the use of genomic datasets from diverse contexts for target prioritization and identi ﬁ cation , which is consistent with endometriosis that is increasingly recognized as a systemic disease ( 4 ) . Characterizing the Cellular Basis and Molecular Hallmarks of Target Gene Prioritization in Endometriosis We used rank - based target set enrichment analysis to characterize prioritized target genes using cell - type - speci ﬁ c gene signatures ( 47 ) . We found the enrichment for immune cells ; these included cells in myeloid lineages ( such as monocytes , neutrophils , and mast cells ) and lymphoid lineages ( such as gamma delta T - cells , CD4 + memory T - cells , and CD8 + effector - memory T - cells ) but not in B - cell lineages ( Figure 4 and Table S2 ) . In addition to immune cells ( for example , gamma delta T - cells ; Figure S1A ) , we also found the enrichment for stromal cells ( Figure S1B ) and epithelial cells ( Figure S1C ) . Taken together , our ﬁ ndings are consistent with evidence of altered immunity and in ﬂ ammation ( local and systemic ) in endometriosis ( 3 ) , and also reveal the cellular basis that might involve multiple lineages underlying the pathogenesis of endometriosis . Next , using MSigDB hallmark gene sets ( 48 ) , we identi ﬁ ed 8 molecular hallmarks enriched in highly prioritized genes ( Figure 5A and Table S3 ) . These included : cellular responses to low oxygen levels ( hypoxia ) , ultraviolet radiation and estrogen ; signaling pathways ( NF - kB signaling in response to TNF , and activation of the PI3K / AKT / mTOR pathway ) ; immune processes ( allograft / transplant rejection , and the complement system ) ; and the apical junction complex . For each of these hallmarks , genes found at the leading prioritization are shown in Figure 5B . We identi ﬁ ed 21 leading prioritized genes that are responsive to hypoxia , with 4 genes ( HSPA5 , IL6 , PDGFB , and SERPINE1 ) encoding components of the complement system and 7 genes ( CDKN1A , DUSP1 , FOS , IL6 , IRS2 , JUN , and VEGFA ) regulated by NF - kB in A B C FIGURE 2 | Genomic prioritization in endometriosis .

Bao et al . Genomics - Led Target Prioritization in Endometriosis Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 758440 6 response to TNF ( Figure 5C ) . We identi ﬁ ed 26 leading prioritized genes involved in the PI3K / AKT / mTOR pathway ( Figure 5B ) , the pathway relevant to the severity of endometriosis stages ( 63 ) . Among these 26 genes , 7 ( AKT1 , EGFR , IL2RG , IL4 , LCK , MAP3K7 , and PRKCB ) are also involved in allograft rejection ( Figure 5C ) , the consequences of which may cause tissue injury and ﬁ brosis . These results revealed diverse but related molecular hallmarks in endometriosis , indictive of being an in ﬂ ammatory systemic disease . Pathway Crosstalk - Based Attack Analysis Identi ﬁ es Critical Genes and Repurposed Drugs Using the KEGG resource ( 52 ) , we proceeded to perform pathway enrichment analysis for the top 1 % prioritized target genes . This identi ﬁ ed a wide range of organismal system pathways that can be broadly categorized into immune , endocrine , nervous , and reproductive systems ( Figure 6A ) . It is well - recognized that maladaptation of these organismal systems can occur in chronic in ﬂ ammatory systemic diseases ( 64 ) . Integrated analysis of these enriched pathways identi ﬁ ed a 31 - gene network ( P = 3 . 1 × 10 − 213 on permutation test ) , re ﬂ ective of crosstalk between pathways , that all contained highly prioritized genes in endometriosis ( Figure 6B and Table S4 ) . Using the information on approved therapeutics available in the ChEMBL database ( 44 ) , we found 5 genes that are already targeted by licensed medications ( approved drugs ) in other diseases ( Figure 6B ) . Removing / attacking a node critical for the crosstalk would result in large numbers of disconnected nodes . We found that the crosstalk identi ﬁ ed above was very robust to node removal . The maximal effect achieved by any individual node removal was as low as 10 % network disconnection ( that is , removing AKT1 gene ; Figure 6C ) . The identi ﬁ cation of AKT1 , or more generally , genes in the PI3K / AKT / mTOR pathway ( including MTOR , PIK3CA , and PIK3R1 in addition to ATK1 ; see also Figure 5 ) , is in line with current interests targeting this pathway in endometriosis ( 65 ) . This motivated us to further perform combinatorial attack analysis in the context of AKT1 . The 2 - node maximal effect was observed when removing another approved drug target , ESR1 , EGFR , JAK1 , PIK3CA or SRC ( Figure 6C ) . Therapeutic agents targeting ESR1 are now under phase 3 clinical trials in endometriosis ( 66 ) , and thus , we further performed attack analysis in the context of AKT1 + ESR1 , with maximal network disconnection ( ~ 16 % ) achieved by 3 - node removal ( Figure 6C ) . These ﬁ ndings supported the usefulness of our identi ﬁ ed crosstalk genes for drug repurposing ( Figure 7 ) . For example , estrogen receptor modulators / agonists targeting ESR1 FIGURE 4 | Cellular basis of therapeutic targeting in endometriosis .

Cross - Disease Prioritization Map Between Endometriosis and Immune Diseases Identi ﬁ es Shared and Distinct Target Gene Clusters A systematic review has con ﬁ rmed that endometriosis has statistically signi ﬁ cant associations with immune - mediated diseases ( CRO , MS , RA , SJO , SLE , and UC ) ( 8 ) . Hereinafter , we explored such relationships based on the top 5 % prioritized genes in endometriosis . We indeed observed signi ﬁ cant correlations of priority ratings between endometriosis and immune diseases ( Figure 8A ) . To further capture such correlations , we next employed a supra - hexagonal map ( 54 ) for cross - disease comparisons ( Figure 8B , Figure S2 and Table S5 ) . Each presentation illustrates a disease - speci ﬁ c prioritization pro ﬁ le ( in which hexagons are color - coded to show priority ratings for genes thereof ) , while consensus neighbor - joining tree captures the ( dis ) similarity of prioritization pro ﬁ les between diseases . The observed A C B FIGURE 5 | Exploring molecular hallmarks of therapeutic targeting in endometriosis .

For example , genes shared between two hallmarks ( the PI3K / AKT / mTOR signalling and allograft rejection ) are framed in oval shape . Bao et al . Genomics - Led Target Prioritization in Endometriosis Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 758440 8 relationships are consistent with therapeutic / phenotypic similarity . For example , in ﬂ ammatory bowel diseases ( CRO and UC ) are grouped together , and in ﬂ ammatory systemic diseases ( SJO , SLE , and RA ) stay closer . To systematically identify target genes that are shared between diseases and are unique to speci ﬁ c diseases , we grouped nearby hexagons and identi ﬁ ed 6 target clusters ( C1 - C6 ) , each containing genes with similar prioritization patterns ( Figure 8C and Table S5 ) . Among these , C6 was highly rated in all diseases analyzed , displaying the highest percentage of approved therapeutics ( Figure 8D ) . Notably , C5 was highly rated in endometriosis only and contained a relatively low proportion of approved drug genes ( Figure 8D ) , indicative of being under - explored . In agreement with this , we found the highest degree of support from clinical evidence ( approved drugs ) for genes in C6 , and no enrichment was observed for genes in C5 ( Figure 8E ) . Next , we characterized C5 and C6 using Reactome pathways ( 55 ) . We found the enrichment for genes in C6 that are engaged in all major immune system pathways , except for neutrophil A B C FIGURE 6 | Pathway crosstalk - based attack analysis identi ﬁ es critical genes and repurposes licensed medications .

Genomics - Led Target Prioritization in Endometriosis Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 758440 9 degranulation that was speci ﬁ c to C5 ( Figure 8F ) . To con ﬁ rm this , we performed functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology ( 56 ) . We found that genes in C5 are mostly functionally relevant to neutrophil degranulation and are localized in the secretory granule lumen ( Figure S3A ) . Using Mammalian Phenotype Ontology ( 57 ) , we also observed phenotypic enrichments for genes in C5 ; these genes , when knocked out , tended to cause lethality phenotypes ( Figure S3B ) . Exploring Repurposing Opportunities Based on Shared Target Genes Genes in C6 were highly prioritized across diseases ( Figure 8 ) . Based on these genes , we explored repurposing opportunities via a heatmap - like illustration ( Figure 9 ) . In addition to priority ratings , this illustration collectively showed how these genes are particulate in immune system pathways , including cytokine signaling ( interferon signaling and interleukin signaling ) , innate immunity ( toll - like receptor and Fc epsilon receptor 1 ) and adaptive immunity ( T - cell receptor ) . We identi ﬁ ed 20 approved drug targets that are mostly immune - related . These genes provide opportunities for licensed immunomodulatory drugs that could be repurposed for the potential use in endometriosis , particularly disease - modifying anti - rheumatic drugs ( DMARDs ) . They include biological DMARDs ( such as inhibitors of TNF , IL6 , and IL6R ) and targeted synthetic DMARDs ( such as kinase inhibitors targeting JAK1 / 2 / 3 , SRC , LYN , SYK , and LCK ) . Of particular interest , TNF is a well - established therapeutic target for chronic in ﬂ ammatory diseases ( 68 ) . We suggest that drugs targeting this gene should be studied in cohort - scale clinical trials for repurposing in endometriosis , such as in ﬂ iximab ( known as anti - TNF biologics ) . Exploring Tractable Evidence for Neutrophil Degranulation Target Genes Speci ﬁ c to Endometriosis As shown in the heatmap visualization in Figure 10A , genes in C5 were speci ﬁ cally prioritized in endometriosis and characterized by neutrophil degranulation . Neutrophils are highly versatile and plastic . Plastic neutrophils are rendered through degranulation , in which cytoplasmic granules are mobilized and fused with the plasma membrane ( 69 ) . Accumulating evidence supports the tumour metastatic spread model in which neutrophils mediate the migration of cancer cells to distant sites ( 70 ) . Interestingly , we found that neutrophil degranulation genes in C5 are almost all linked to cancer ; for example , those involved in breast cancer are the genes ATG7 ( 71 ) , CAP1 ( 72 ) , CCT8 ( 73 ) , CD14 ( 74 ) , CYFIP1 ( 75 ) , and QSOX1 ( 76 ) . Notably , neutrophil degranulation genes have been reported to be associated with endometriosis , such as A1BG ( a diagnostic marker for stage II , III and IV endometriosis ) ( 77 ) and ATG7 ( an autophagy gene in ovarian endometriosis ) ( 78 ) . Finally , we explored the tractable evidence ; a tractable gene was de ﬁ ned if its known protein structures were predicted to contain druggable pockets ( Figure 10B ) . We suggest that the tractable genes involved in neutrophil degranulation are of particular interest to inform future clinical studies . DISCUSSION Our organismal systems ( mainly immune , endocrine , nervous , and reproductive ) are evolutionarily conserved to maintain homeostasis . If these systems fail to coordinately respond to invaders or ectopic hazards , autoimmunity or other forms of systemic in ﬂ ammation might occur . If such maladaptation persists , it may eventually lead to chronic in ﬂ ammatory systemic diseases ( 64 ) . We have found that genetic target genes prioritized in endometriosis are signi ﬁ cantly enriched in a wide range of organismal system pathways ( Figure 6 ) and molecular hallmarks ( Figure 5 ) . These ﬁ ndings strongly support the increasing recognition of endometriosis as an in ﬂ ammatory systemic disease .

Genomics - Led Target Prioritization in Endometriosis Frontiers in Immunology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 758440 13 Our identi ﬁ cation of target genes shared with immune diseases suggests drug repurposing opportunities ( Figure 9 ) . Drug repurposing is a strategy that repositions existing effective drugs with acceptable safety from original indications ( such as immune diseases ) to new indications ( here , endometriosis ) . Immunomodulatory targets and DMARDs are rich in numbers and have been well - studied in therapeutic targeting . In the next steps , DMARDs represent a wish list that should be taken forward for validation , for example , to assess ef ﬁ cacy on perturbation in patient - derived cell assays ( 53 ) . Given that multiple cell lineages might be involved in endometriosis ( Figure 4 ) , we utilized single - cell RNA - seq datasets of endometriosis ( 49 ) to examine the expression of shared target genes ( listed in Figure 9 ) . We found that these genes were expressed in one or more cell clusters that were assigned to patients with endometriosis ( Figure S4A ) . Using genes speci ﬁ cally expressed in ﬁ broblasts of ectopic endometrium ( as compared to ﬁ broblasts of normal endometrium ) ( 49 ) , we showed that these ﬁ broblast - speci ﬁ c genes tended to be highly prioritized ( Figure S4B ) , supporting the importance of ﬁ broblasts in endometriosis . We know that neutrophils are highly plastic and can mediate the transport of cancer cells into distant sites ; plasticity and metastasis - like spread are both enabled by granule mobilization and exocytosis ( known as ‘ degranulation ’ ) ( 69 , 70 ) . Systemic circulating neutrophils from endometriosis patients display distinct expression pro ﬁ les when compared to neutrophils from healthy controls , and the lesion microenvironment contains factors such as IL - 8 that promote recruitment of neutrophils ( 79 ) . The identi ﬁ cation of endometriosis - speci ﬁ c targets essential for neutrophil degranulation ( Figure 10 ) not only brings forward new ideas for therapies targeting neutrophil degranulation , but also provides important clues about how endometriosis might spread to distant tissues or organs , causing in ﬂ ammatory - like microenvironments . Our ﬁ ndings expand the existing theories that are proposed to explain the cause of endometriosis ( the origin of disease ) , including : ( i ) Sampson ’ s retrograde menstruation ( or the implantation theory ) , stating that at menses , endometrial cells re ﬂ ux through the fallopian tubes and invade pelvic structures , where coordinated growth of nerves and blood vessels ( known as ‘ neuroangiogenesis ’ ) may occur and elicit an in ﬂ ammatory response , ﬁ brotic scarring and pain ; ( ii ) the coelomic metaplasia theory ( 80 ) , postulating that mesothelial cells may transform into ectopic endometrial tissue through metaplastic transition ; and ( iii ) stem cell traf ﬁ cking , particularly endometrial mesenchymal stem / stromal cells ( 81 , 82 ) and bone marrow - derived stem cells ( 83 ) . We anticipate that consolidating mixed evidence to unify all ﬁ ndings ( including ours ) might be the most parsimonious explanation for this in ﬂ ammatory systemic disease . We have also used gene expression signatures ( 50 ) involving two endometriosis stages ( I / II and III / IV ) at two menstrual cycle phases ( proliferative and secretory ) to examine the highly prioritized target gene expression ( Figure S5A ) . Target set enrichment analysis revealed the enrichment of gene signatures in stage I / II endometriosis ( early disease ) , independent of menstrual cycle phases . For stage III / IV endometriosis ( late disease ) , the enrichment was observed at the proliferative cycle phase but not at the secretory cycle phase . These results suggested that highly prioritized target genes tended to be expressed in the early stage of disease , which is consistent with the pro - in ﬂ ammatory pro ﬁ le in stage I / II endometriosis ( 50 ) . We also found that genes highly prioritized only in endometriosis ( listed in Figure 10 ) were mostly expressed in stage I / II disease ( relative to the healthy counterpart ; Figure S5B ) . In summary , we have shown that multi - layered genomic datasets ( including new information on genetic susceptability loci identi ﬁ ed in GWAS on endometriosis , regulatory genomics , and protein interactome ) can be harnessed with our prioritization approach to generate an atlas of genetic target prioritizations in endometriosis ( Figures 1 - 3 ) . This atlas has enhanced our understanding of endometriosis as an in ﬂ ammatory systemic disease and has also expanded the existing theories on the origin of disease . More importantly , we have discovered target candidates that are speci ﬁ c to and tractable for disease . Genomic insights and therapeutic candidates arising from this study may change our perspectives on endometriosis and our strategies for coping with disease , envigorating further research and drug repurposing .
