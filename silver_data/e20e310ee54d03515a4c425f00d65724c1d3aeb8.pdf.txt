Any assessment of the effect of the vaccine on community transmission by use of observational data is complicated by two factors . Firstly , the probability of an individual to be infected is greatly influenced by personal behavior and transmission rates in that individual’s immediate surroundings ; secondly , the probability of a person to be tested for COVID - 19 depends on multiple factors , such as education level or testing availability 3 – and often on the existence of symptoms . Using data obtained from the computerized database of the Maccabi Healthcare Services ( MHS ) , the second largest Healthcare Maintenance Organization ( HMO ) in Israel , we tried to overcome these two potential biases . We analyzed household contacts of confirmed COVID - 19 cases , thereby solely including a population at a very high risk of contracting COVID - 19 4 – 7 . Thus , we essentially examined vaccine effectives given confirmed exposure ; comparing those exposed ( whether in the household or in the community ) but not infected to those exposed ( whether in the household or in the community ) – and infected , across vaccination statuses . In addition , the probability of a person to be tested for COVID - 19 when a household member had already been infected was extremely high in Israel during the study period , therefore allowing for a closer approximative analysis of asymptomatic infection , often not tested and therefore underdiagnosed – potentially impacting the vaccine effectiveness analyses published thus far . In Israel , a large - scale vaccination program was initiated on December 20 , 2020 , well before similar efforts were undertaken in other countries 8 .

Methods We performed an observational cohort study that included household members of confirmed COVID - 19 cases , and estimated the effectivness of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine vaccine in this high - risk setting . Participants were considered for inclusion from 20 / 12 / 2020 onwards , corresponding to the starting date of the national COVID - 19 vaccination rollout program . The occurrence of a first episode of infection was recorded up to March 8 , 2021 ; by this time roughly 50 % of the entire Israeli population had been vaccinated . Additional household infections were recorded for ten extra days , until March 17 , 2021 . Study population In Israel all citizens are insured by one of four HMOs as part of a national medical insurance scheme , of which MHS is the second largest with roughly 2 . 5 million members . For the purpose of this analysis , a household was defined as having two adults . Only households with two adults were included so the protective effect of vaccination could be assessed in a relatively homogenous adult population , given reports of both lower transmission and lower susceptibility in children 12 . Additionally , including more than two members in a household would have required a correction for the number of ‘individuals at risk’ as well as for ‘degree of exposure’ .

Participants were classified into one of three vaccination status groups in time of the index case ( the confirmed exposure ) : Unvaccinated ; Recently Vaccinated Once , i . e . those vaccinated with the first vaccine dose within 0 - 7 days before the index infection ( time of confirmed exposure ) ; and Fully Vaccinated participants , i . e . those who were 7 or more days post the second dose of the vaccine by the time of the confirmed exposure . The second group , i . e . Recently Vaccinated Once , was chosen as a reference period , when the vaccination protective effect is presumably still insignificant ( as opposed to persons more than 12 days after the 1 st vaccine , when some protection does probably exist ) 11 . This enabled us to compare persons who chose to be vaccinated and were either fully protected or not protected at all , and thus to control for possible inherent differences between those who chose not to be vaccinated at all . COVID - 19 was diagnosed with the use of nationally approved SARS - CoV - 2 polymerase - chain - reaction ( PCR ) testing kits . Study outcomes The study’s primary outcome was COVID - 19 infection within ten days of COVID - 19 diagnosis in an additional adult member of the same household ( where an index infection occurred ) . Both index and additional cases were defined by at least one positive SARS - CoV - 2 polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test recorded in the MHS computerized database , considering that all such testing in MHS members is recorded centrally . Household members of confirmed cases were considered not infected if all PCR tests were negative or if no COVID - 19 testing was performed . All rights reserved .

As annual disengagement rates are lower than 1 % , longitudinal data are available for nearly all persons insured in the MHS . We used existing demographic and background medical data . COVID - 19 tests and performance dates were recorded for each patient , as were the dates of the first and second BNT162b2 vaccine administration . Statistical analysis We assessed the probability of a COVID - 19 infection occurring up to 10 days after a previously diagnosed COVID - 19 infection in a given household . The probability of being infected was calculated separately for the three vaccination status groups , namely the unvaccinated , those vaccinated within 0 - 7 days of the first dose of the vaccine , and the fully vaccinated . For the primary endpoints , vaccine effectiveness was defined for Unvaccinated versus Fully Vaccinated and Unvaccinated versus Recently Vaccinated Once as one minus the risk ratio . Individuals differ in their decision be tested for COVID - 19 . Their vaccination status , perceived risk of infection , and symptomatology could all effect this decision 13 . Furthermore , the Israeli Ministry of Health’s regulations indicating that fully vaccinated persons were not obliged to exercise self - quarantine when exposed to a confirmed COVID - 19 individual , may have affected the likelihood of vaccinated persons to be tested after an exposure .

We calculated corrected vaccine effectiveness rates assuming that untested individuals were as likely to be infected as tested ones . Therefore , we calculated a corrected effectiveness rate , simulating a scenario in which 100 % of adult household members are tested , under the assumption that the probability of test positivity remains constant ( rather than decreases in untested individuals ) . This analysis intends to demonstrate the least - favorable ( or strictest ) scenario for vaccine effectiveness , enabling us to estimate lower bound efficiency . Our final tier of analyses addressed the problem of defining an “index” infection as opposed to an “additional” infection , in light of a known time lag between the infection event and its detection ( positivity lag and symptom lag ) 7 . That is , it could be argued that the temporal sequence of household infections reflects the time of testing ( or detection ) , but not necessarily the time of infection , especially when these are close ( i . e . , the index infection and the additional infection are actually reversed ) . This could be of importance , as we analyzed the vaccination status of the “additional” infection given confirmed exposure . Therefore , this final analysis examined household members who shared the same vaccination status , referred to hereinafter as homogeneously vaccinated couples . This method eliminates the need to determine the order of infections within a given household , as the status of the additional infection is identical to that of the index infection , therefore , the analyzed scenario is one where exposure certainly occurred – and vaccine protectiveness is examined in either the ‘index’ or ‘additional’ household member . Confidence intervals for binomial probability were calculated , based on Wilson’s score interval . All statistics were performed using Python version 3 . 1 with the stats models package .

Informed consent was waived by the IRB , as all identifying details of the participants were removed before computational analyses . Results Participants and rates of additional COVID - 19 infections From December 20 , 2020 to March 17 , 2021 , data were available for 1 , 312 , 372 households that included 2 , 455 , 924 individuals . We excluded 784 , 404 households of only one member and 345 , 365 households with varying numbers of children . Next , we excluded 8 , 034 households in which an infection was recorded before December 20 , 2020 . Out of the remaining 173 , 569 households , 6 , 351 households had at least one recorded infection by March 8 th , 2021 . These households were subject to two different methods of analyses ( see Methods ) . The first included 4 , 024 households stratified into ‘index’ infection and ‘additional’ infection occurring within 10 days across defined vaccination status groups ; the second is an analysis of 3 , 672 homogenously vaccinated couples of the three vaccination groups . ( Figure 1 ) . Mean age of all adult household members was 58 . 9 ( SD - 13 . 5 ) , as aged increased with the likelihood of being vaccinated . Females constituted roughly 50 % ( Table 1 ) .

Rates of additional COVID - 19 infections occurring within ten days of the index infection were 37 . 5 % ( 95 % CI - 35 . 7 to 39 . 3 ) and 41 . 7 % ( 95 % CI - 38 to 45 . 5 ) of the Unvaccinated and Recently Vaccinated Once household members of COVID - 19 patients , respectively . The proportion of vaccinated household members who tested positive for COVID - 19 in the same time period was significantly lower - 7 . 5 % ( 95 % CI - 5 . 6 to 10 ) ( Table 2 ) . Vaccine effectiveness for Fully Vaccinated compared to Unvaccinated participants was 80 . 0 % ( 95 % CI - 73 . 0 to 85 . 1 ) , and for Fully Vaccinated individuals compared to those who were Recently Vaccinated Once 82 . 0 % ( 95 % CI - 75 . 5 to 86 . 7 ) .

The rates of PCR testing were 79 . 4 % ( 95 % CI - 77 . 9 - 80 . 9 ) , 85 . 3 % ( 95 % CI - 82 . 3 - 87 . 8 ) and 57 . 2 % ( 95 % CI - 53 . 1 - 61 . 3 ) for the Unvaccinated , Recently Vaccinated Once , and Fully Vaccinated participants . ( Figure 2 , Supplementary Tables S2 ) . As expected , the probability of being tested was lower when the additional household member was a fully vaccinated individual . We calculated corrected effectiveness rates , assuming that untested individuals were as likely to be infected as tested ones – thereby estimating lower bound efficiency ( see methods ) . The corrected effectiveness of Fully Vaccinated compared to Unvaccinated individuals was 72 . 0 % ( 95 % CI - 65 . 2 to 77 . 5 ) and 73 . 0 % ( 95 % CI - 66 . 0 to 78 . 5 ) when Unvaccinated was compared to Recently Vaccinated Once participants .

For each vaccination status groups we calculated the proportion of couples in which both members tested positive within 0 - 10 days , out of the total number of homogenous couples in which at least one member tested positive . Additional infections occurred in 49 . 8 % ( 95 % CI - 48 - 51 . 6 ) of homogenously unvaccinated couples , in 56 . 2 % ( 95 % CI - 51 . 1 - 61 . 1 ) of homogenous couples recently vaccinated once , and in 12 . 5 % ( 95 % CI - 9 . 1 - 17 . 0 ) of homogenously vaccinated couples within the ten days time window ( Table 3 ) . Demographic data of these couples can be seen in Supplementary Table S3 . Using this approach , vaccine effectiveness in fully vaccinated individuals was 74 . 8 % ( 95 % CI - 65 . 4 to 81 . 6 ) when compared to unvaccinated ones , and 77 . 7 % ( 95 % CI - 69 . 0 to 83 . 9 ) when compared to participants recently vaccinated once . Addressing the probability to be tested by implementing the same method described above yields lower bound effectiveness rates , or corrected effectiveness rates . For homogenously vaccinated household members , the corrected effectiveness of fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated ones was 70 . 1 % ( 95 % CI - 61 . 3 to 76 . 9 % ) and 70 . 5 % ( 95 % CI - 61 . 2 to 77 . 4 ) compared to the control group of individuals recetly vaccinated once ( Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S4 ) .

Moreover , the question of vaccine effectiveness given confirmed exposure has yet been established , though it derives important policy implications , such as the need for self - quarantine when exposed and lockdown policies in high - risk areas . In this large cohort , we examined household contacts of confirmed COVID - 19 patients , therefore utilizing the microenvironment of the household to best ensure exposure , after which we analyzed vaccine effectiveness . 7 . 5 % of fully vaccinated individuals , who are household members of confirmed COVID - 19 patients were infected within ten days . Infection rates among unvaccinated or those who received only one vaccine dose within seven days were much higher at 37 . 5 % and 41 . 7 % , respectively . These figures translate into vaccine effectiveness rates of 80 . 0 % and 82 . 0 % when fully vaccinated persons were compared to participants who were either unvaccinated , or vaccinated only once within seven days of the index infection . While these rates are somewhat lower than vaccine effectivness rates in the original BNT162b2 randomized controlled trial , and vaccine effectiveness rates observed in a large representative sample of the Israeli population 8 , the degree of protection afforded by the vaccine is still very high , even in this very high - risk exposure scenario . These relatively high effectiveness rates following a high - risk exposure are encouraging news both for the individuals who choose to be All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

When we analyzed additional infection rates among households with homogenous vaccination status ( i . e . adult household members either both vaccinated or both unvaccinated ) , we found that in households with two adults who were both fully vaccinated , 12 . 5 % of household members still tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 after exposure . While these rates were much higher for households in which both adults were unvaccinated , the risk of infection for fully vaccinated persons is not negligible and justifies the continuous use of non - vaccine protective measures when fully immunized persons are in contact with COVID - 19 patients 15 . The present study was designed to fill a few gaps in existing data . Firstly , we included persons who were all definitely exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 ( potentially in the community and definitely in their household ) , and had an extremely high - risk of being infected . Secondly , we performed secondary analyses correcting for a possible selection bias that stems from the different likelihood of persons to be tested for COVID - 19 , depending on their vaccination status . In these non - RCT , real - world , scenarios , those not tested are often asymptomatic , or only mildly symptomatic 16 – 18 . The probability of testing contacts in Israel during the study period were generally very high ( 79 . 4 % , 85 . 3 % and 57 . 2 % in the three vaccination status groups in this trial ) . Therefore , although structured screening was not performed , the high testing rates coupled with the correction performed for the differing testing rates in the three study groups , enable us to estimate with a high degree of confidence vaccine effectiveness for COVID - 19 that is not All rights reserved .

Our study has several limitations . All data are observational , therefore testing was not performed with the use of a strict clinical protocol . Therefore , testing was less likely to be performed for vaccinated household members and asymptomatic cases may have been missed . We did not include data on viral strains . We assumed that all exposure within a given household posed a high risk of transmission , but we are unable to quantify the actual level of exposure with a given household . The large sample size , high vaccination rates , high testing rates , and correction performed for missing testing all partly overcome these limitations . Household studies are certainly an efficient way of assessing vaccine effectiveness in a given population 6 , 19 – 22 , allowing for analyses of infection rates when exposure is confirmed with a high degree of certainty – thus avoiding the potential skewing effect of intrinsic differences amongst communities . Additionally , there is a high likelihood that the same SARS - CoV - 2 strain infected persons living in the same household . Two issues are the subject of our future research , currently underway ; first , the inclusion of more than two household members in general and of children in particular . Transmission dynamics could be influenced by age , and children are more likely to be asymptomatic and less likely to be tested . Children may also affect of the magnitude of exposure as they increase the number of persons per household 12 . “Quantifying” exposure relative to vaccine protectiveness , that is whether being exposed to more than one infected individual can influence vaccine effectiveness , All rights reserved .

Secondly , in this study , we have not accounted for the vaccination status of the index case . Our upcoming study attempts to create a model accounting for the possible transmission potential of the index case ( rather than solely the susceptibility potential of household members ) . Conclusions This study shows that the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine is highly effective in a very high - risk , real life , scenario , but the protection rates afforded in these settings are somewhat lower than those previously described in an RCT or a population - based study . Household members of COVID - 19 patients , those caring for them in the healthcare setting , and any other individuals with a confirmed exposure to a COVID - 19 patient , are still at risk of being infected 20 even if fully vaccinated , and should use personal protection measures if possible .
