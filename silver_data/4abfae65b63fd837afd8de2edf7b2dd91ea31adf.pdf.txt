Protein phase separation hotspots at the presynapse Janin Lautenschläger Department of Clinical Neurosciences , Cambridge Institute for Medical Research , University of Cambridge , Cambridge CB2 0XY , UK JL , 0000 - 0001 - 7788 - 7074 Fundamental discoveries have shaped our molecular understanding of presynaptic processes , such as neurotransmitter release , active zone organization and mechanisms of synaptic vesicle ( SV ) recycling . However , certain regulatory steps still remain incompletely understood . Protein liquid – liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) and its role in SV cluster - ing and active zone regulation now introduce a new perception of how the presynapse and its different compartments are organized . This article high - lights the newly emerging concept of LLPS at the synapse , providing a systematic overview on LLPS tendencies of over 500 presynaptic proteins , spotlighting individual proteins and discussing recent progress in the field . Newly discovered LLPS systems like ELKS / liprin - alpha and Eps15 / FCho are put into context , and further LLPS candidate proteins , including epsin1 , dynamin , synaptojanin , complexin and rabphilin - 3A , are highlighted . 1 . Introduction When the first study demonstrated that proteins with low - complexity domains could undergo phase transition forming jelly - like hydrogels , this unveiled a new paradigm for the formation of subcellular compartments [ 1 ] . Nowadays , vast evidence emphasizes a role of protein phase separation in the formation of dynamic organelles like RNP transport granules , stress granules and P - bodies or in the compartmentalization of the nucleus [ 2 , 3 ] . More and more membrane - less compartments are identified , and the understanding that also the presynapse is sub - compartmentalized via liquid – liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) is emerging . The very first example of LLPS at the presynapse was synapsin - 1 phase separation , shown to regulate synaptic vesicle ( SV ) clustering [ 4 ] . Furthermore , RIM / RIMBP LLPS has been demonstrated to couple local cal - cium entry to SV release at the active zone [ 5 ] . A protein ’ s tendency to undergo protein phase separation is conveyed by amino acid regions that do not adopt a well - defined structure and are therefore called intrinsically disordered regions . These protein regions , until now , were more or less neglected for understanding a protein ’ s function because no clear role could be assigned . However , it now becomes critical to understand which proteins or protein regions could participate in various LLPS systems . In addition , also protein regions with a less complex amino acid composition , called low - complexity domains , or protein regions with an enrichment of cer - tain amino acids ( i . e . proline , arginine , serine ) tend to support weak protein – protein interactions ( PPIs ) , known to be involved in LLPS . To date , we have gained an initial understanding of presynaptic LLPS from recent studies ; however , to understand this system in its full complexity we do need a better overall picture of which processes and proteins could be regulated and influenced by LLPS . Therefore , this article contains the first systematic analysis evaluating over 500 synaptic proteins for their intrinsic disorder , low complexity and enrichment of amino acids . It provides a novel resource and discusses known and potential presynaptic LLPS systems . © 2022 The Authors .

Methodology This study followed a three - step approach . Presynaptic proteins were identified via UniProtKB and Gene Ontology [ 6 – 9 ] . IUPred2A , SMART and PAXdb were used to retrieve information about intrinsic disorder , low complexity domains , amino acid composition and protein abundance [ 10 – 12 ] . Protein - protein interaction profiles were obtained from the STRING database ; Cytoscape and ClusterONE were used to perform PPI network analysis [ 13 – 15 ] ( table 1 ) . 3 . Results This study identified 578 presynaptic proteins , for which the PPI network showed six main protein hotspots ( figure 1 ) . These were assigned to the following biological processes : Hotspot 1 : Active zone cluster . Hotspot 2 : Endocytosis protein cluster . Hotspot 3 : Exocytosis , priming and fusion protein cluster . Hotspot 4 : Proteins involved in proton transmembrane trans - port / v - type proton ATPase complex . Hotspot 5 : Two protein clusters involved in the negative regulation of secretion and neurotransmitter reuptake . Hotspot 6 : Rab signal transduction protein cluster . The prediction data show that Hotspot 1 , Hotspot 2 and Hot - spot 3 are enriched for proteins with a higher tendency to undergo LLPS . These are interesting hits , since components of the active zone have currently been highlighted to undergo LLPS and first studies demonstrate that LLPS could also play a role in early endocytosis . This article will pick up these examples and put them in context with the findings of this study , giving an overview of recent progress in the field and allowing the systematic view on proteins of the three respective synapse compartments , the active zone , com - ponents of clathrin - mediated endocytosis and the hotspot in SV exocytosis . Data for all 578 synaptic proteins on their intrinsic disorder , low - complexity domains and proline con - tent are available as electronic supplementary material , table S1 . 4 . Protein hotspot active zone The active zone defines the region of the presynaptic mem - brane where SV fusion and neurotransmitter release occurs . SV clustering at the active zone seems to occur independently of synapsin - 1 [ 16 ] , and therefore the existence of an additional SV condensate has been proposed early on [ 17 ] . This analysis shows that proteins of the active zone hotspot are enriched for high intrinsic disorder , where the three protein groups ( i ) bassoon / piccolo , ( ii ) RIM / RIMBP proteins and ( iii ) liprin proteins are of particular interest ( figure 2 ; electronic supplementary material , table S2 ) . Bassoon and piccolo , two proteins with high sequence similarity , are the top candidates from the prediction analysis . Both show the largest average intrinsic disorder value of the Table 1 .

Bassoon and piccolo are large scaffold - ing proteins of the active zone cytomatrix and cover a 100 nm distance from the active zone , as shown by super - resolution microscopy [ 18 ] . Simultaneous knock out of both , bassoon and piccolo , leads to a decrease in SV numbers [ 19 ] , therefore , making them potential candidates for an active zone protein condensate holding the SVs which are not affected by synapsin KO . However , while LLPS has been shown for the protein hits RIM / RIMBP and liprin , no phase separation has been reported for the high - profile candidates ’ bassoon and piccolo . Therefore , investigation of bassoon / piccolo in relation to their protein partners , i . e . CAST and RIMBP will be of particular interest [ 20 ] . RIMS1 ( regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis protein 1 ) , which has been shown to undergo LLPS recently [ 5 ] , was identified as another high intrinsic disorder profile protein . It has been demonstrated that RIMS1 is able to condensate on its own , but phase separation is substantially potentiated in the presence of the RIM - binding protein RIMBP2 . All pro - teins of this class , RIMS1 , RIMS2 , RIMBP1 and RIMBP2 , display a high intrinsic disorder and a relatively high pro - portion of low complexity . RIM / RIMBP condensates show co - condensation with the intracellular C - terminal region of the voltage - dependent N - type calcium channel subunit alpha - 1B ( CACNA1 ) . These condensates are , therefore , likely to position voltage - gated calcium channels to the site of SV release [ 5 , 21 – 23 ] . Upon quadruple knock out of all RIM / RIMBP proteins , the tight tethering and priming of SVs to the active zone is disturbed [ 24 ] . However , it seems that overall , the larger pool of SV recruited to the active zone is not severely affected . Here , bassoon and pic - colo could come into play , possibly being able to extent and support the RIM / RIMBP condensate . In addition , RIM is also known to bind Rab3 , Munc13 , ELKS and liprin - alpha proteins [ 25 ] , which are potential partners adding further functionality to the RIM / RIMBP LLPS condensate . ELKS and liprin proteins have been identified next , show - ing high intrinsic disorder and also about 9 – 15 % of low complexity . A very recent paper studying ELKS and SYD - 2 , the Caenorhabditi elegans homologue of liprin - alpha , found that these proteins can undergo LLPS . Different to other LLPS systems , ELKS and SYD - 2 matured into solid like struc - tures easily , being less dynamic later in life . Therefore , a role during synapse development is suggested [ 26 ] . By contrast , a more dynamic nature is shown for liprin - alpha3 , whose phase separation can be reversibly regulated by PKC [ 27 ] . Interestingly , ELKS and the liprin proteins show no enrich - ment for proline , while this is the case for many other synaptic LLPS proteins . For example for synapsin - 1 , where the proline rich domain is important for its interaction with the SH3 domain protein intersectin [ 4 ] , and for RIM where proline rich motifs are important for its interaction with RIMBP [ 5 ] . Again , also bassoon and piccolo are highly proline rich , with 13 % and 11 % , respectively . Figure 1 .

This further supports the maintenance of two separate SV pools , the reserve pool , where synapsin clusters the majority of SVs , and an SV cluster which is situated in a 100 nm dis - tance of the active zone , regulated by RIM / RIMBP and potential additional proteins . Compared to synapsin - 1 , all the identified active zone proteins , bassoon / piccolo , RIM / RIMBP , ELKS and liprins , show low abundance levels ( all less than 50 ppm , electronic supplementary material , table S1 ) , which speaks for a multicomponent LLPS system , rather than one protein on its own serving as a matrix . Lastly , the calcium binding protein 4 ( CABP4 ) should be highlighted from this study . This protein is involved in neurotransmission at the photoreceptor and shows very high intrinsic disorder values . Furthermore , it has been linked to human rod and cone dysfunction in humans [ 29 ] . An overview on all parameters of respective active zone pro - teins can be found in figure 2 ( excerpt ) and electronic supplementary material , table S2 . 5 . Protein hotspot clathrin - mediated endocytosis If the SV cluster and the active zone are regulated and sup - ported by protein LLPS , we might think of synapse LLPS as a more universal mechanism , also involved in other synapse processes . This analysis shows that the endocytosis hotspot is highly enriched for highly intrinsically disordered proteins . Indeed , the disordered regions of many endocytosis proteins have been recognized to regulate membrane curva - ture via a steric effect [ 30 , 31 ] . A protein region with high intrinsic disorder not folding into a well - defined structure , spans a larger volume than a well - folded region . Therefore , if the protein gets densely packed on the membrane , these regions get close together , creating steric pressure , which is able to bend the underlying membrane . However , it has recently been demonstrated that also protein phase separ - ation contributes to membrane bending [ 32 ] . This analysis shows that proteins throughout the endocytosis pathway Figure 2 . Overview on active zone proteins ( excerpt ) . Protein characteristics include intrinsic disorder ( Av , average , line profile along the full protein sequence ) , low complexity ( number of low - complexity domains ; percentage of protein length ) and percentage of proline ( Pro ) , arginine ( Arg ) , serine ( Ser ) and aromatic amino acid ( AAA ) content .

Early factors of clathrin - mediated endocytosis Proteins involved in early steps of the endocytosis process are important to recognize cargo proteins , to induce membrane curvature and to link cargo uptake to the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 . The most interesting proteins in this analysis are ( i ) epsin proteins , ( ii ) Eps15 and FCho , and ( iii ) Stonin2 and AP180 ( figure 3 ) . While many cargo proteins can be recog - nized by the AP - 2 complex directly via conventional tyrosine - or dileucine - based signals , the proteins above have particular roles in SV cargo uptake [ 34 ] and are found to support membrane curvature generation . Epsin - 1 is the endocytosis protein with the highest intrin - sic disorder in the study , closely followed by epsin - 3 and epsin - 2 . Epsin binds to the lipid membrane via its ENTH ( epsin N - terminal homology ) domain , while its intrinsic dis - ordered region mediates an effect on membrane curvature [ 30 ] . No experimental data on LLPS has been published for epsin proteins to date . However , epsin is known to mediate cargo selection of ubiquitinated proteins , thus LLPS in relation with polyubiquitination might need to be considered [ 35 – 37 ] . Beside a high intrinsic disorder , epsin - 1 also has sev - eral low complexity regions which together span 30 % of the protein , though for epsin - 3 and epsin - 2 this proportion is lower . All epsin proteins show an enrichment for proline , while epsin - 2 and - 3 also show a high serine content ( 12 % compared to an average serine content of 7 % in the full dataset ) . Eps15 ( epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 ) and FCho1 / 2 ( F - BAR domain only protein 1 / 2 ) are two additional early endocytosis proteins with high LLPS - tendency . Eps15 and FCho1 have been recently shown to undergo LLPS , where Eps15 forms highly dynamic droplets , which are able to enrich FCho [ 33 ] . In addition , it has been shown Figure 3 . Overview on proteins involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( excerpt ) . Protein characteristics include intrinsic disorder ( Av , average , line profile along the full protein sequence ) , low complexity ( number of low complexity domains ; percentage of protein length ) and percentage of proline ( Pro ) , arginine ( Arg ) , serine ( Ser ) and aromatic amino acid ( AAA ) content .

Proline is not overall enriched in these proteins , but Eps15 is known to have one local proline - rich motif at its C - terminal end , as well as an PQ - rich domain . Interestingly , Ede1 , which is the yeast homol - ogue of Eps15 , has also been shown to undergo LLPS [ 38 ] . Furthermore , it has been demonstrated that other early endo - cytic proteins lose their punctate localization in the absence of Ede1 [ 38 ] , which fits well with the current understanding that LLPS is able to specifically co - condense protein partners . As for epsin - 1 , Eps15 has been shown to modulate membrane curvature [ 39 ] and is also involved in ubiquitin cargo selection . AP180 and Stonin - 2 , both accessory proteins involved in cargo recognition , exhibit protein regions with high intrinsic disorder . AP180 and the endocytic clathrin adaptor CALM have been shown to be involved in the endocytosis of VAMP SNARE proteins , mediated by the ANTH ( AP180 - amino - terminal - homology ) domain [ 40 , 41 ] . The C - terminal half of AP180 , however , shows high intrinsic disorder and has been found to contribute a steric effect on membrane curvature as discussed for epsin - 1 [ 30 , 42 ] . AP180 has a particularly high low complexity content of 35 % and shows a high percentage of proline and serine ( both 11 % ) . Stonin - 2 on the other hand is involved in cargo selection of the calcium sensor synaptotagmin [ 43 , 44 ] showing high N - terminal intrinsic disorder and a high serine content ( 12 % ) . No phase separation has been shown for either , AP180 or stonin - 2 , however , for stonin - 2 an association between several SV proteins has been discussed to facilitate SV protein cargo uptake [ 45 ] . The AP2 adaptor complex itself is highly ordered with only very small disordered regions of the alpha and beta - sub - units linking its appendage domains . However , the AP2 - interacting clathrin - endocytosis protein ( KIAA1107 ) and AP2 - associated protein kinase 1 ( AAK1 ) show high intrinsic dis - order ( figure 3 ) . Also , clathrin heavy chain 1 and 2 , building the long triskelia of the clathrin cage , are highly ordered pro - teins . But again , clathrin light chain B and A are highly disordered with values similar to epsin - 2 and - 3 . They bind to the clathrin heavy chain via a long central a - helix [ 46 , 47 ] , while the N - terminal regions accumulate high intrinsic dis - order and have been found to support the interaction with other proteins , as for example with the Huntingtin - interacting protein 1 - related protein [ 48 – 50 ] . 5 . 2 . Maturation and fission of the clathrin coated pit The current analysis shows that also proteins at later steps of endocytosis , involved in maturation and fission of the clathrin coated pit , are enriched for high intrinsic disorder . For this ( i ) membrane shaping proteins like amphiphysin , endophilins and syndapin , but also ( ii ) dynamin and ( iii ) N - WASP , are of particular interest . Amphiphysin and endophilins are N - BAR domain pro - teins involved in later stages of endocytosis . Their N - BAR domain folds as a dimer with a concave face , therewith con - veying a pressure on the underlying membrane . However , it has been shown that also the intrinsic disordered region sub - stantially contributes to their membrane shaping function by generating steric pressure as found for early membrane shap - ing proteins [ 31 ] . A similar effect could be involved in the membrane shaping behaviour of the F - BAR domain proteins syndapin 1 and 2 ( PACSIN1 / 2 ) , featuring a C - terminal high intrinsic disorder region . Whether protein phase separation of these proteins contributes to membrane bending is not known , but is principally possible as demonstrated for FUS LLPS on lipid vesicles [ 32 ] . The functional role of amphiphysin , endophilin and synda - pin lies at the periactive zone , however , under resting conditions these proteins localize to the central SV cluster [ 51 ] . Here parallels might be drawn to intersectin , which has been demonstrated to localize to the SV cluster at rest , under - going shuttling to the periactive zone upon synaptic activity [ 52 ] . Intriguingly , intersectin is a protein which co - condenses together with synapsin - 1 [ 4 ] , suggesting that intersectin is loca - lized to the SV cluster via LLPS . Once the synapsin condensate disassembles upon synaptic activity , intersectin would be able to diffuse and re - localize . The interaction between intersectin and synapsin - 1 is mediated via SH3 domains and the proline rich region of synapsin [ 4 ] . Also amphiphysin , endophilins and syndapin constitute each a single C - terminal SH3 domain , which has been shown to weakly interact with synap - sin - 1 [ 53 ] . Thus , a similar mechanism can be imagined for amphiphysin , endophilin and syndapin . Though , if another protein condensate is involved at the periactive zone to capture intersectin and / or other endocytic proteins is speculative . Nevertheless , the phenomenon of endocytosis proteins localiz - ing to the SV cluster might demonstrate a dynamic way able to coordinate the timely delivery of these proteins to the periac - tive zone upon synaptic stimulation . In addition it has also been discussed that these proteins might contribute to the matrix of the SV cluster [ 54 ] . Dynamin - 1 is a membrane remodelling GTPases impor - tant for vesicle scission . As this , dynamin is a well - structured protein , forming helical polymers around the tub - ular vesicle neck , mediating membrane constriction [ 55 ] . However , it also contains a highly disordered region at its very C - terminal end , which is also enriched in proline ( 7 % , figure 3 ) . This region mediates an interaction with SH3 domain proteins , including amphiphysin , endophilin , synda - pin and also intersectin [ 53 , 55 , 56 ] . Dynamin has not been reported to undergo LLPS , but is also enriched in the SV clus - ter under resting conditions [ 51 ] . Interesting to note , dynamin itself does not have any SH3 domain , only the dynamin - binding protein ( DNMBP ) contains multiple SH3 domains . Finally , dyna - min is a highly abundant protein ( greater than 1900 ppm ; electronic supplementary material , table S1 ) and thus might be a candidate as a matrix protein . N - WASP , the Neural Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein , is a well - studied LLPS protein , stimulating Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation [ 57 , 58 ] . In this analysis N - WASP shows the highest intrinsic disorder after epsin , and has one of the high - est proline contents ( 17 . 8 % ) . Actin is highly enriched at the periactive zone [ 52 ] , and a wide range of synaptic proteins , including amphiphysin , DNMBP , syndapin and intersectin , show an interaction with actin or with N - WASP . Furthermore , it has recently been shown that dynamin is regulating actin filament bundling , mediated via its C - terminal proline rich domain [ 59 ] . Thus , our understanding of how phase sep - aration could contribute to actin dynamics at the synapse could deliver new insights for synapse organization . 5 . 3 . Clathrin coat disassembly After scission of the clathrin coated vesicle , the clathrin coat itself and adaptor proteins need to be removed . This analysis r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s o b O p e n B i o l . 12 : 210334 6 shows that ( i ) synaptojanin - 1 and ( ii ) auxilin are proteins with high LLPS tendencies in this pathway . Synaptojanin - 1 is a protein known to couple the fission of clathrin - coated vesicles to the uncoating process [ 60 , 61 ] , which is regulated via dephosphorylation of membrane lipids and the release of adaptor proteins [ 60 , 62 ] . Synaptoja - nin - 1 contains a central inositol 5 - phosphatase domain and an N - terminal Sac1 - like inositol phosphatase involved in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 regulation , while its C - terminal domain is highly disordered and enriched in proline . This proline rich region mediates synaptojanin ’ s interaction with SH3 domain pro - teins , including endophilin , amphiphysin , syndapin and intersectin [ 63 , 64 ] . In this context , endophilin has been demonstrated to regulate the recruitment of synaptojanin ’ s during endocytosis [ 65 , 66 ] . Auxilin ( DNAJC6 ) is involved in the disassembly of the clathrin coat , recruiting the heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein ( Hsc70 ) and serving as Hsc70 cofactor . Hsc70 again is responsible for the actual coat disassembly [ 67 , 68 ] . Auxilin is described to bind very rapidly after the recruitment of dynamin , just during the process of vesicle neck constriction and subsequent fission [ 69 ] . Aux - ilin binding has been reported to be mediated via lipid sensing of its N - terminal PTEN region [ 69 ] ; however , it also interacts with dynamin . This interaction is specific for the GTP - bound conformation of dynamin , but the GTPase domain nor the GAP domains themselves are suf - ficient for binding [ 70 ] , indicating that an additional binding mechanism is involved which has not been described yet . 6 . Protein hotspot synaptic vesicle exocytosis As a third hotspot , SV exocytosis proteins were identified . We think of SV exocytosis as a process where protein binding depends on specific protein conformation as for the SNARE Figure 4 . Overview on proteins involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis ( excerpt ) . Protein characteristics include intrinsic disorder ( Av , average , line profile along the full protein sequence ) , low complexity ( number of low complexity domains ; percentage of protein length ) and percentage of proline ( Pro ) , arginine ( Arg ) , serine ( Ser ) and aromatic amino acid ( AAA ) content .

But once again intrinsic disorder regions have been discussed to serve a steric function , enabling the pro - teins to span a higher radius for interaction [ 72 ] . Of particular interest regarding LLPS tendencies are ( i ) complex - ins , ( ii ) Rabphilin - 3A as well as ( iii ) the SNARE complex proteins themselves . Complexins are small proteins for which inhibitory as well as facilitating effects on SV release have been described . Com - plexin - 2 is enriched in excitatory synapses , while complexin - 1 is important for inhibitory synapses . All of the complexins have a high intrinsic disorder and also a high level of low com - plexity regions ( 13 – 31 % ; figure 4 ; electronic supplementary material , table S4 ) . However , they are not enriched in proline . Complexins have not been shown to undergo LLPS , but inter - estingly complexin - 2 is one of the highly abundant synapse proteins ( greater than 1000 ppm ; electronic supplementary material , table S1 ) and its regulatory role in SV release has remained challenging to explain [ 73 – 77 ] . Rabphilin - 3A , which is recruited to the SV membrane via Rab3A also shows a high average intrinsic disorder and is possibly linked to the RIM / RIMBP LLPS systems via Rab3A and Munc13 [ 25 ] . Rab3A has been shown to be crucial for the activity - dependent transport of SV to the active zone [ 78 ] ; therefore , Rab3A and Rabphilin - 3A might demonstrate interesting candidates to understand the shuttling between the SV cluster condensate constituted by synapsin - 1 and the active zone condensate regulated by RIM / RIMBP . The three SNARE complex proteins also display high - intrinsic - disorder regions . VAMP2 , syntaxin - 1A and SNAP25 are well studied for their function in the four helical SNARE complex mediating SV fusion . However , their high intrinsic disorder regions have been discussed to confer an additional role by spanning a higher radius than a folded region would , thereby increasing the likelihood to recruit their binding partners [ 72 ] . A role via LLPS has not been shown but could allow the association between SV proteins before complex formation , or on the other hand facilitate protein sorting after exocytosis . The v - SNARE VAMP2 shows the highest low complexity content ( 33 % , N - terminal , electronic supplementary material , table S1 ) as well as a high proline con - tent ( 7 % ) . By contrast , the t - SNAREs ( i . e . syntaxin - 1A and SNAP25 ) have an extremely low proline content of 3 % or below . This might demonstrate a relevant difference since these proteins are throughout localized to the plasma mem - brane where they are reported to form distinctive nanoclusters [ 79 , 80 ] . 7 . Discussion Protein phase separation enables proteins to concentrate in a protein dense phase and is evolving as a mechanism relevant for the spatio - temporal organization within cells and the synapse . The concept of LLPS can harmonize current discre - pancies , giving a better understanding how proteins are able to accomplish their function . Thus the LLPS model for SV clustering via synapsin - 1 is able to overcome certain discre - pancies of the classical synapsin - SV - actin tethering model [ 51 ] . LLPS can be seen as a mechanism for the regulation of highly dynamic processes and is complementary to the mech - anisms we already know . Many of our current findings build upon the fundamental understanding of protein regions and protein interactions known so far . Proteins not only convey one role or mechanism of action , but different properties come together . This we have seen for N - Bar domain proteins regulating membrane curvature by two complementary mechanisms , demonstrating that one mechanism is sup - ported by the other , is serving as a backup or is adding further functionality . The present study , evaluating data on intrinsic disorder , low complexity domains and amino acid composition of synapse proteins , gives an overview of poten - tial LLPS mechanisms at the synapse . It emphasizes how synaptic processes are supported by protein LLPS , opening new question to be asked and stimulating a novel way of thinking on how proteins organize synaptic compartments . Next steps are the construction of a prediction tool specific to the synapse compartment . Several LLPS prediction tools have been developed over the years including PScore , PLAAC , PSPer , CatGranule , R + Y and LARKS [ 81 , 82 ] . These rely on specific protein properties , like pi – pi contacts , simi - larity to prion - like domains or FUS - like proteins , or low complexity aromatic - rich segments . Overall these predictions are of course dependent on proteins we already know to undergo protein phase separation and therefore , at the moment , have a high representation of DNA / RNA binding proteins . A new approach solely relies on a prediction due to differences in the amino acid content of LLPS proteins [ 83 ] . Again , a bias towards DNA / RNA binding proteins is seen ; however , combined with a growing dataset on synapse LLPS this demonstrates an interesting avenue to develop a predic - tion tool specific for synapse LLPS proteins . In the future , novel technologies in data science including artificial intelli - gence will allow to develop learning algorithms implementing new data step by step helping us to understand specific and distinct LLPS compartments at the synapse .
