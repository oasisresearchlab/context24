The yeast dy - namin - related protein Vps1 functions at several stages of membrane trafﬁcking , including Golgi apparatus to endosome and vacuole , peroxisomal ﬁssion , and endocytic scission . We have previously shown that in its endocytic role , Vps1 functions with the amphiphysin heterodimer Rvs161 / Rvs167 to facilitate scission and release of vesicles . Phosphoproteome studies of Saccharo - myces cerevisiae have identiﬁed a phosphorylation site in Vps1 at serine 599 . In this study , we conﬁrmed this phosphorylation event , and we reveal that , like Rvs167 , Vps1 can be phosphorylated by the yeast cyclin - associated kinase Pho85 in vivo and in vitro . The importance of this posttranslational modiﬁcation was revealed when mutagenesis of S599 to a phosphomimetic or nonphosphorylatable form caused defects in endocytosis but not in other functions associated with Vps1 . Mutation to nonphos - phorylatable valine inhibited the Rvs167 interaction , while both S599V and S599D caused defects in vesicle scission , as shown by both live - cell imaging and electron microscopy of endocytic invaginations . Our data support a model in which phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Vps1 promote distinct interactions and highlight the importance of such regulatory events in facilitat - ing sequential progression of the endocytic process . D ynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in mem - brane fusion and ﬁssion ( 1 – 3 ) . While mammalian dynamins are known to be involved in several membrane - trafﬁcking events , the role of dynamin - 1 in endocytosis is the best - characterized role of this protein family . Dynamin - 1 has been proposed to act largely in a mechanical way to encircle the necks of invaginated endocytic vesicles , facilitating scission of the vesicles during endocytosis ( 4 – 6 ) . An additional , regulatory role has also been suggested in which dynamin functions earlier as a molecular switch through its GTPase domain to regulate recruitment or activity of proteins within the endocytic complex ( 7 , 8 ) . Recent studies in live cells haveindicatedthatthereisapositive - feedbackloopfunctioningat endocytic sites , with dynamin , actin and N - BAR proteins , such as endophilin and amphiphysin , cooperating to bring about efﬁcient scission of membranes in order to release a vesicle ( 9 , 10 ) . Quan - titative ﬂuorescence microscopy of dynamin - 2 stoichiometry and dynamics and its functional interdependency with actin have re - cently been studied . This has revealed that while low levels of dynamin are present early in endocytosis , actin recruitment di - rectly precedes the precise temporal recruitment of further dy - namin and that sufﬁcient monomers to generate a single dynamin ring localized to sites prior to scission ( 11 , 12 ) . Vps1 is a dynamin - like protein and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the only dynamin with clear functions in membrane - trafﬁcking pathways ( 13 – 17 ) . The other two dynamin - like proteins in S . cerevisiae , Dnm1 and Mgm1 , both function in mitochondrial ﬁs - sion / fusion ( 18 , 19 ) , with Dnm1 having an additional function in peroxisomal ﬁssion ( 20 – 22 ) . Like other dynamins , Vps1 is pre - dicted to have a GTPase domain and a stalk region . However , in common with nonclassical dynamins , it does not have a PH do - main , but at an equivalent position in the protein there is an al - ternative domain referred to as insert B . Despite the absence of a PH domain , we have previously demonstrated that Vps1 is local - ized to endocytic sites and is able to bind and tubulate liposomes ( 14 ) . Others have shown interactions between Vps1 and the en - docytic adaptor Sla1 : defects in uptake of endocytic dyes and dis - rupted cortical actin ( 13 , 17 ) . Real - time analysis of single endo - cytic events demonstrates that vps1 deletion compromises scission events so that retraction to the plasma membrane is commonly observed ( 14 ) . This phenotype suggests that Vps1 functions in a similar way to Dyn1 or Dyn2 in mammalian endocytosis . In ad - dition , disruption of interactions between Vps1 and its binding partners , the yeast amphiphysin protein Rvs167 and actin , also disrupt endocytic scission ( 23 , 24 ) . Analysis in yeast has allowed fundamental aspects of endo - cytic - site assembly and disassembly to be analyzed in detail , and subsequent studies in mammalian cells have demonstrated that key temporal stages of the process are conserved ( 10 , 25 , 26 ) . However , major questions remain concerning the progression of endocytosis . How are proteins ﬁrst recruited and then removed from the site ? How are proteins recycled for subsequent endocytic events ? It seems likely that posttranslational modiﬁcations are central to this process , and many proteins that localize to endo - cytic sites have been identiﬁed in global phosphoproteomic stud - Received 27 August 2015 Returned for modiﬁcation 8 October 2015 Accepted 10 December 2015 Accepted manuscript posted online 28 December 2015 Citation Smaczynska - de Rooij II , Marklew CJ , Allwood EG , Palmer SE , Booth WI , Mishra R , Goldberg MW , Ayscough KR . 2016 .

However , given that phosphorylation can occur promis - cuously , it has been difﬁcult to determine key phosphorylation events that are important for stages of endocytosis to progress . In yeast , later stages of coat disassembly that are proposed to occur concomitantly with scission have been shown to be regulated by Ark1 / Prk1 kinases ( homologs of mammalian AAK / GAK ) , and de - letion of these kinases prevents disassembly of some proteins , in - cluding Pan1 and Sla1 , from the endocytic site ( 28 – 30 ) . Further - more , the yeast amphiphysin Rvs167 is phosphorylated by the Pho85 kinase , and mutation of phosphorylation sites compro - mised its interaction with a regulator of actin polymerization , Las17 ( ahomologofWASp ) ( 31 ) . However , inthiscase , theeffects of phosphomutants on endocytic progression were not deter - mined . In mammalian cells , dynamin has been reported to be phos - phorylated by a number of kinases , including Dyrk1 , Cdk5 , Akt , and glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) ( 32 – 36 ) . Furthermore , phosphorylation - dephosphorylation cycles of dynamin - 1 have been shown to be essential for regulating activity - dependent bulk endocytosis during neuronal activity ( 37 ) . Global phosphoproteome studies in yeast have identiﬁed a phosphorylation site at residue Ser599 in Vps1 ( 27 ) . This residue is in the insert B region , which we have previously demonstrated also contains a binding site for the SH3 domain of the amphiphy - sin Rvs167 ( 23 ) . In this study , we aimed to investigate the function of this phosphorylation event to determine whether the modiﬁca - tion plays a role in any or all known Vps1 functions . We con - ﬁrmed the phosphorylation site using mass spectrometry ( MS ) and showed that deletion of the Pho85 kinase affects the Vps1 phosphorylation state . We then addressed whether the S599 phos - phorylation event plays a regulatory role in cellular activities of Vps1 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials .

Carboxy - peptidase Y ( CPY ) processing was analyzed in cell extracts as described previously ( 23 ) . Precleaned CPY antibodies ( Chemicon International ) were used at 1 : 100 dilution . Transformations were performed using lith - ium acetate , as previously described ( 39 ) . The two - hybrid screen used pJ69 - 2A ( 40 ) and plasmids listed in Table 2 . Epiﬂuorescence microscopy , uptake of FM4 - 64 , time - lapse live - cell imagingofgreenﬂuorescentprotein ( GFP ) - ormCherry - taggedproteins , and all image processing were performed as described previously ( 23 ) . Time - lapse live - cell images of Rvs167 - GFP were acquired using OMX DeltaVisionV4anda60 (cid:5) USPLAPO ( numericalaperture , 1 . 42 ) objective with refractive index 0 . 1514 immersion oil ( Cargille ) . Samples were illu - minated using Insight Solid State Illuminator ( 10 % ) , and images were taken simultaneously on separate scientiﬁc complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( sCMOS ) cameras ( 70 - msexposure ) . Six200 - nmsections were acquired every 510 ms ( 180 time points ) . The stacks were then de - convolved and processed , using SoftWorx , to produce a movie composed of maximum intensity projections at each time point . The Rvs167 - GFP lifetime was analyzed from those projections . For electron microscopy analysis , yeast cells were grown to mid - expo - nential phase at 30°C and harvested by syringe ﬁltration . The concen - trated cells were transferred to a Leica ﬂat specimen carrier and frozen in a Leica Empact high - pressure freezer . Freeze substitution and ﬁxation were carried out in a Leica AFS freeze substitution unit . Frozen specimens were ﬁxed using ﬁxative ( 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate , 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 5 % H 2 O in acetone ) at (cid:6) 90°C for 48 h and then warmed to (cid:6) 25°C for 12 h . The ﬁxative was removed by three 15 - min washes in acetone at (cid:6) 25°C . Samples were inﬁltrated with Lowicryl HM 20 resin ( Polysciences ) , and the resin was polymerized by UV irradiation . The blocks were cut into 40 - to 60 - nm - thick sections using a Diatome Ultrasonic diamond knife on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome ( Leica Microsystems ) . The sections were stained with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 min , washed 20 times with water and stained with Reynold’s lead citrate for 10 min , washed again , and air dried . The endocytic invaginations on the plasma membranes of these yeast cells were viewed at 100 kV in a Hitachi H7600 transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) . The lengths of identiﬁed invaginations were measured using ImageJ software .

RESULTS Vps1 phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro . To verify the global phosphoproteome studies , mass spectrometry was per - formed on HA - tagged Vps1 that had been isolated on beads from wild - type yeast extracts growing in the exponential growth phase . Five high - conﬁdence sites were identiﬁed ( high - conﬁdence iden - tity , posterior error probability [ PEP ] , (cid:8) 0 . 01 ; high - conﬁdence localization , 1 % false - localization rate ) at Ser599 , Ser579 , Ser 570 , Thr242 , and Thr247 ( shown in red in Fig . 1A ) . In addition , other sites were identiﬁed , either with medium - conﬁdence identity ( PEP (cid:9) 0 . 01 ) but with high - conﬁdence localization or with high - conﬁdence identity ( PEP (cid:8) 0 . 01 ) but low - conﬁdence localization ( (cid:9) 1 % false - localization rate ) . The positions of these are marked in blue in Fig . 1A . To further investigate phosphorylation in our yeast strains , Vps1 - HA was overexpressed and immunoprecipitated .

A small size shift could be de - tected on a standard SDS - PAGE gradient gel ( Fig . 1B , top , middle lane ) . However , because of the difﬁculties in detecting small size shifts in relatively large proteins ( (cid:9) 80 kDa ) , the gel additive Phos - tag was used . Phos - tag is an additive that is able to bind to phos - phate groups , increasing their mass and thus making changes in the phosphorylated state easier to detect . The immunoprecipitates were run on a gel and blotted . As shown in Fig . 1B , bottom , Vps1 - HA incubated with alkaline phosphatase ( (cid:10) AP ) has fewer bands and slightly increased mobility in the gel , indicating re - moval of phosphate groups from the protein . In order to investigate the role of possible kinases in this phos - phorylation event , whole - cell extracts were made from cells in whichgenesforspeciﬁckinaseswithareportedlinktoendocytosishadbeendeleted . Vps1 was not tagged in these experiments . The mobility of bands was observed to determine possible changes in phosphorylation . As shown in Fig . 1C , deletion of yak1 , pbs2 , slt2 , yck1 , or yck2 as a single mutation did not show a change in mobil - ity of Vps1 . Yck1 and Yck2 single deletions have little reported effect in cells , but the double deletion is lethal ; thus , a strain with a deletion of yck1 and a temperature - sensitive allele of yck2 , as well as an isogenic parental wild - type strain ( different from the wild types of the above - mentioned strains ) were also investigated after 4 h growth at the restrictive temperature . Again , no shift was ob - served for Vps1 . Similarly , a double deletion of ark1 and prk1 kinases did not show a mobility shift . In contrast , deletion of the kinase Pho85 gene caused a marked band shift , indicating a reduc - tion in phosphorylation and identifying Pho85 as a kinase capable of phosphorylating Vps1 . Interestingly , Pho85 has also been re - ported to phosphorylate Rvs167 , which we have previously shown to interact with Vps1 . To further conﬁrm Pho85 as a Vps1 kinase , the phosphatase - treated immunoprecipitated Vps1 ( described above ) was incubated with GST - Pho85 puriﬁed from yeast . Fol - lowing incubation , proteins were run on a gel and blotted , and as shown in Fig . 1B ( right lane ) , there was a clear mobility shift , indicating that Pho85 is able to phosphorylate Vps1 . Analysis of consensus phosphorylation sites has demonstrated that Pho85 has a strong proline - directed site preference , with a serine being phosphorylated when directly N terminal of a proline residue . Of the phosphorylation sites detected by mass spectrom - etry , a single site , Ser599 , matches this consensus . S599 was mu - tated to valine ( nonphosphorylatable ) and to aspartate ( phospho - mimetic ) , and whole - cell extracts were made to determine whether this mutation altered the mobility of the protein in a gel . As shown in Fig . 1D , both the Vps1 S599V and S599D mutant proteins ran at the same size as the protein in the pho85 deletion strain and at a smaller size than the wild - type protein ( from both parental background strains ) , indicating that these mutant pro - teins have reduced phosphorylation . Vps1 phosphomutants function normally in nonendocytic functions . Because Pho85 appears to phosphorylate S599 in vivo and because it has previously been linked with Rvs167 function , we focused analysis on the function of the serine 599 residue . In order to determine the in vivo consequences of loss of Vps1 phos - phorylation , S599V and S599D vps1 mutants were generated and expressed in cells lacking endogenous vps1 expression . As shown in Fig . 2A , while vps1 deletion cells exhibit only slow growth at 37°C , both mutants are able to rescue growth to wild - type levels . Vps1 has been shown to function in Golgi apparatus - to - vacu - ole trafﬁcking of the enzyme CPY ( 41 , 42 ) . This transport can be followed by analysis of modiﬁed forms of the protein so that in wild - type cells , only the mature vacuolar form ( mCPY ) is ob - served , while in mutants with defective transport , there is an ac - cumulation of a higher - mass precursor form of the protein ( pCPY ) . In these mutants , CPY is also secreted from cells , so re - duced levels of protein are observed . In the absence of Vps1 , pCPY is observed , while both mutant strains are indistinguishable from cells with wild - type VPS1 ( Fig . 2B ) . Vps1 has also been shown to function in endosomal recycling such that , in its absence , a reporter construct , GFP - Snc1 , is found predominantly as small punctae in cells , with only 10 % (cid:11) 2 % of cells showing any polarized plasma membrane staining . In wild - type cells , this reporter is found largely polarized to the bud plasma membranes of growing buds of cells , as well as in internal structures that are generally larger and more intensely stained than in the vps1 deletion strain ( 97 % (cid:11) 2 % of cells ) ( 23 , 43 ) . In both S599 mutants , the GFP - Snc1 localization resembles that ob - served in wild - type cells ( S599V , 96 % (cid:11) 2 % , and S599D , 95 % (cid:11) 1 % bud - polarized plasma membrane staining ; n (cid:12) 3 experi - ments ) , suggesting the mutant proteins expressed are capable of supporting the endosomal - recycling function of Vps1 ( Fig . 2C ) . One of the original phenotypes associated with vps1 loss of function was defective vacuolar morphology . Rather than 3 to 10 evenly sized vacuoles that could elongate along the mother bud axis during inheritance , vacuoles were more heterogeneous and often appeared to surround a larger structure , which was consid - ered likely to be a vacuole but which was not labeled ( 41 ) . This is the class F category of vacuolar - protein - sorting mutants . As shown in Fig . 2D , the S599 mutants have a vacuole morphology similar to that of the wild type , while the vps1 deletion strain has the classic class F phenotype , with smaller vacuoles surrounding a larger , unlabeled structure . More recently , a clear role for Vps1 in ﬁssion of retrograde carriers from endosomes has been reported . In the vps1 deletion strain , a Vps10 - 2 (cid:5) GFP fusion protein under - goes a prominent shift from Golgi apparatus and endosome local - ization to the vacuolar membrane , similar to the phenotype ob - served for retromer - deﬁcient cells ( 44 ) . As shown in Fig . 2E , expression of wild - type VPS1 and both Vps1 phosphomutants rescues this phenotype , indicating that phosphorylation of this residue does not functionally affect the ﬁssion event . Finally , Vps1 has also been shown to function in peroxisome ﬁssion , so that in the absence of both vps1 and dnm1 , there is a single large peroxisomal structure ( 20 ) . Reexpression of VPS1 res - cues this ﬁssion defect and restores peroxisome numbers . Both S599 mutants are also capable of supporting peroxisome ﬁssion ( Fig . 2F ) . Taken together , the data indicate that mutation of S599 does not compromise Vps1 in its functions in membrane ﬁssion steps at sites away from the plasma membrane . Vps1 phosphomutants have defects in endocytic scission . Previously , we have generated Vps1 mutants that are disrupted only in their endocytic function while rescuing other Vps1 func - tions , including those mentioned here , such as growth at 37°C and peroxisomal ﬁssion . These mutants include Vps1 P564A , which is unable to bind the amphiphysin Rvs167 , and Vps1 RR457 , 458EE , which is unable to bundle actin ﬁlaments ( 23 , 24 ) . To determine whether the S599V or S599D mutations were compromised in endocytosis , the fates of individual reporters were assayed . Sla1 is a protein that binds to cargo and clathrin and also serves as a link , Smaczynska - de Rooij et al . 746 mcb . asm . org March 2016 Volume 36 Number 5 Molecular and Cellular Biology on M a r c h 15 , 2016 b y UN I V O F DURH A M h tt p : / / m c b . a s m . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m via Las17 and Sla2 , to the actin cytoskeleton ( 45 – 47 ) .

However , the behavior of the reporter at the plasma membrane during this time was altered in the mutants .

As shown in Fig . 3B , while 90 % of the patches show normal invagination in wild - type cells , this is reduced to less than 30 % in the vps1 deletion and both mutant strains . Further analysis revealed that in the vps1 - null strain and Vps1 S599V mutant , the predominant behav - ior was retraction , when the patch began to show some invagina - tion and then returned toward the plasma membrane before pro - tein disassembly . The Vps1 S599D mutant had a slightly different phenotype , with the predominant behavior being delayed scission when the patch moved a normal or extended distance but then stayed in this invaginated state before Sla1 was disassembled . Vps1 phosphomutants still retain the ability to localize to endocytic sites . Given that endocytic behavior of patches is com - promised in the mutant cells , it was relevant to determine whether these phosphomutant Vps1 proteins are able to localize to appro - priate cortical sites . We and others have noted that GFP - tagged Vps1 is not fully functional , and we proposed that a likely reason for this is that Vps1 , like other dynamins , forms a ring structure , which is unlikely to accommodate 100 % tagged protein ( 38 , 44 ) . Thus , while a ﬂuorescent tag can be used to indicate localization of Vps1 , the lifetime and behavior of the protein are most likely com - promised . To determine whether the phosphomutants are able to localize to appropriate cortical sites , we ﬁrst used a bimolecular - ﬂuorescence approach in which Vps1 tagged with one half ( V N ) of a split yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) Venus tag could localize in the proximity of Rvs167 tagged with the complementary half of the tag ( V C ) . As shown in Fig . 4A , while neither tag alone could elicit a signal , in combination , both the wild type and Vps1 mu - tants are able to localize to endocytic sites so that the V N and V C tags are in close enough proximity to allow a signal to be gener - ated . AsecondapproachanalyzedcolocalizationofVps1 - GFPand Abp1 - mCherry . In wild - type cells , brief periods of colocalization could be observed with lifetimes of 6 to 8 s , similar to those pre - viously reported ( 14 ) . In all cases , Abp1 - mCherry was observed to localize to the sites prior to Vps1 - GFP . Intriguingly , in the case of the mutants , two classes of localization were observed . In about 40 % of cases , the spots were as in the wild - type case , with Abp1 - mCherry arriving ﬁrst followed by a short colocalization of about 6 to 8 s with Vps1 - GFP . However , in about 60 % of cases with both mutants , Vps1 - GFP was observed at sites prior to Abp1 - mCherry . In these cases , the period of colocalization was pro - longed ( 10 to 14 s ) . While the effect of the tag on functionality FIG 3 Effects of Vps1 mutations on behavior of an early endocytic marker , Sla1 - GFP .

Examples of kymographs depicting these behaviors are shown . Error bars indicate standard deviations .

Vps1 phospho - site mutations affect the interaction with the amphiphysin Rvs167 . Given that an interaction between Vps1 and the amphiphysin Rvs167 has been previously reported and that deletion of rvs167 also causes retraction phenotypes , it was also relevant to determine whether the Rvs167 lifetime at the site is altered by the mutations . In this study , rather than simply record - ing the lifetime in a single plane , an OMX microscope setup was used that allowed rapid recording of full z - stacks to allow any movement out of a single focal plane to be followed . The lifetimes of Rvs167 both at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 5A , Membrane ) and during the invagination ( Fig . 5A , Movement ) were differentiated in order to determine whether distinct stages of endocytosis were affected . As shown in Fig . 5A and in kymograph form in Fig . 5B , in the absence of Vps1 , the lifetime of Rvs167 - GFP is reduced com - pared to that in cells in which wild - type VPS1 is expressed ( 23 ) . The stage most affected is the invagination stage , with the time spent in this stage reduced from 5 . 5 s ( VPS1 ) to 2 . 9 s ( vps1 (cid:3) ) . Interestingly , analysis of the Rvs167 - GFP lifetime in the mutants indicated that in the nonphosphorylatable S599V mutant , Rvs167 - GFP had a markedly shorter lifetime in both stages , sim - ilar to the null strain , while in the phosphomimetic S599D mu - tant , the Rvs167 lifetime was more similar to that observed in cells expressing wild - type VPS1 . The effect of the S599V mutation on shortening the lifetime is clear from kymographs . This analysis also shows the delayed scission phenotype for the S599D mutant that was also noted in the Sla1 - GFP analysis . The different lifetimes of Rvs167 - GFP in the two mutants sug - gested that the mutants might be differentially affected in their physical interaction with Rvs167 . Previously , an interaction be - tween Rvs167 and Vps1 was shown both using yeast two - hybrid analysis and with puriﬁed proteins ( 23 ) . Here , we used yeast two - FIG 4 Localization of Vps1 phosphomutants to endocytic sites .

As shown in Fig . 5C , the S599V mutation is severely compromised in its interaction with Rvs167 , while the S599D interaction appears more modestly reduced . The inhibited interaction of S599V with Rvs167 might therefore un - derlie the reduced timing of Rvs167 localization to endocytic sites . Further evidence for the effect of the mutations on an interaction between Rvs167 and Vps1 in vivo was shown using genetic ap - proaches . In the absence of vps1 , Rvs167 overexpression was det - rimental to the cells at elevated temperatures ( Fig . 5D ) ( 48 ) . This lethality could be rescued by cooverexpression of Vps1 , indicating that the interaction renders excess Rvs167 nontoxic to the cell . Overexpression of the Vps1 S599D mutant is also able to rescue Rvs167 overexpression - induced lethality to an extent similar to thatwithwild - typeVps1 , supportingtheideathataninteractionis stillabletooccur . Incontrast , overexpressionofVps1S599Visnot able to rescue lethality .

Although kymographs indicate that scission might be in - hibited or delayed in the Vps1 S599 mutants , it is not possible to visualize these defects directly using ﬂuorescence microscopy . To determine whether the S599 mutations affected the ultrastructure of endocytic invaginations , cells were ﬁxed by high - pressure freez - ing followed by freeze substitution . Following staining , sections were analyzed for the presence of plasma membrane invagina - tions . Where membrane proﬁles could be followed for the full length of the invagination , the length of the invagination was re - corded . As shown in Fig . 6 , expression of vps1 carrying mutations in the S599 site resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the average invagination length . Cells with wild - type VPS1 had a mean invag - ination length of 37 nm compared to 65 . 5 nm in Vps1 S599D cells and 57 . 1 nm in Vps1 S599V mutants . These increases were con - sidered signiﬁcant in a one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) using Dunn’s multiple - comparison test . Images of invaginations in the wild - type and mutant strains are shown . The data conﬁrm those obtained from ﬂuorescence microscopy , indicating that both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are likely to be im - portant for appropriate Vps1 functioning during endocytosis . Analysis of puriﬁed Vps1 S599 mutants . In order to gain fur - ther insight into the effect of Vps1 S599 mutants on protein func - tion , mutant forms of the protein were puriﬁed . Recently , we were able to demonstrate that puriﬁed Vps1 protein can form oligo - meric ring structures ( 38 ) . The two Vps1 S599 mutants were pu - riﬁed and examined using transmission electron microscopy fol - lowing negative staining . As shown in Fig . 7A , both mutants were able to form ring structures similar to those found with wild - type protein . The sizes of the uniform single rings were 32 . 2 (cid:11) 3 . 7 nm for wild - type Vps1 and 31 . 4 (cid:11) 2 . 9 nm and 30 . 5 (cid:11) 3 . 3 nm for the S599V and S599D mutants , respectively . The capacity to form higher - order , double - ring structures also seems to be maintained . In previous work , we have also shown that Vps1 can bind lipo - somes , but we had not undertaken an analysis of lipid binding preferences ( 14 ) . Using a dot blot approach with PIP strips , the wild - type and mutant proteins were incubated overnight to allow interaction , and binding was detected with anti - His antibodies . As shown in Fig . 7B , the wild - type Vps1 and the S599V mutant have very similar proﬁles of lipid binding , with clear binding only to the phosphatidylinositol monophosphates . The strongest binding ap - peared to be for phosphatidyl 3 - phosphate [ PI ( 3 ) P ] . The S599D mutation did cause a reduction in binding to PI ( 4 ) P or PI ( 5 ) P but did not appear to affect PI ( 3 ) P binding . PIP arrays that carry dif - ferent levels of lipids were then used to determine the extent of this apparent loss of PIP binding in the S599D mutant . The wild - type ( nonphosphorylated recombinant ) Vps1 and the phosphomi - meticVps1S599Dmutantproteinswereincubatedwiththemem - branes before probing with anti - His antibodies . As shown in Fig . 7C , both wild - type Vps1 and Vps1 S599D were observed to bind most strongly to all phosphatidylinositol monophosphate lipids , with the strongest binding to PI ( 3 ) P and with very weak binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P2 detectable . This ﬁnding suggests that the S599D mu - tation causes a slight but not complete reduction in the ability of the protein to interact with PI ( 4 ) and PI ( 5 ) P . It also suggests that the ability of Vps1 to localize to membranes may be at least in part associated with lipid binding , as analysis of Vps1 - GFP shows the strongest localization to endosomes that are enriched in PI ( 3 ) P ( 49 , 50 ) . DISCUSSION Inthiswork , wehavedemonstratedthattheyeastdynaminVps1is phosphorylated on multiple residues . In vivo , it appears that the kinase Pho85 is important for the Ser599 phosphorylation event and that this modiﬁcation regulates Vps1 interaction with the am - phiphysin Rvs167 . Mutation of the S599 site , however , does not affect the ability of Vps1 to be localized to endocytic sites . When phosphorylated , Vps1 can interact with Rvs167 , but this is not FIG 6 Effect of S599 mutation on ultrastructure of plasma membrane invaginations .

This suggests that dephosphorylation of Vps1 is required to complete the cycle and facilitate the scission step . Rvs167 itself is phosphorylated by the kinase Pho85 / Pcl2 on three serine - proline ( SP ) motifs in the region between its BAR domain and its SH3 domain ( 31 ) . The functions of these modiﬁ - cations have not been explored in depth , but lack of phosphory - lation of Rvs167 by Pho85 correlates with loss of Rvs167 SH3 domain binding to the yeast WASP homolog Las17 ( 31 ) . Rvs167 has also been shown to bind directly to lipids and , in conjunction with Rvs161 , to promote lipid tubule formation ( 51 ) . The data we show here support our previous work showing the importance of an interaction between Rvs167 and Vps1 during endocytosis . The Vps1 S599V mutation completely abrogates the yeast two - hybrid interaction with Rvs167 . Overexpression of the S599V mutant also failed to rescue the temperature sensitivity caused by the ex - pression of excess Rvs167 in cells . In contrast , the S599D mutant can still interact with Rvs167 in a yeast two - hybrid assay . The interaction level appears slightly reduced , but this is possibly due to the aspartate residue not being a fully effective replacement for the phosphate group that would be present on the wild - type pro - tein . S599D overexpression does , however , interact sufﬁciently welltorescuetheRvs167overexpressionphenotype . Itiscurrently unclear whether Vps1 interacts with the Rvs161 / Rvs167 am - phiphysin heterodimer in vivo or whether it interacts with Rvs167 in a distinct interaction . While most data have pointed to a func - tion of Rvs161 and Rvs167 as an obligate heterodimer , the reason for the higher number of Rvs167 molecules reported in cells and the differential stability when one or the other gene is deleted is currently unclear ( 52 , 53 ) . There are a number of models that can be put forward to bring together the available data . The simplest of these is that Vps1 is recruited to endocytic sites just prior to invagination . The effect of some Vps1 mutants , causing an early defect in the ability of the membrane to invaginate rather than just affecting the postinvagi - nation scission stage , supports this time of arrival ( 14 , 38 ) .

( B ) Lipidbindingpreferenceswere investigated using a PIP strip assay following incubation with puriﬁed proteins and detection with anti - His antibodies . ( C ) PIP arrays were performed using wild - type and S599D mutant proteins to determine whether differences between binding on the PIP strip were due to a complete block in binding caused by the mutation or whether there was a more subtle change in lipid afﬁnity .

We propose that it is in this form that the Pho85 kinase is able to phosphorylate Vps1 and thereby promote an interaction with Rvs167 . This interaction might either support the recruit - ment of higher levels of Rvs167 or promote reorganization and oligomerization of Rvs167 at the site . Given that we have shown Vps1 can form oligomeric rings of a deﬁned size ( 24 ) , it is possible that Vps1 forms a template structure for amphiphysin BAR do - main oligomerization and thereby promotes invagination . Alter - natively , or in addition , the Vps1 rings might facilitate a curvature of the membrane that aids the membrane interaction of the am - phiphysin itself . Data on the ultrastructure of invaginations in the Vps1 S599D mutant indicate that the ﬁnal scission step requires dephosphor - ylation . This would act to reduce the Vps1 - Rvs167 interaction and allow scission to proceed . If Rvs167 and Vps1 were phosphory - lated by Pho85 at the same stage , it would mean that during mem - brane invagination , Rvs167 would be phosphorylated and thus unable to bind Las17 . However , following phosphatase action , as well as promoting disassembly of Vps1 - Rvs167 , this would also allow Rvs167 to interact with Las17 . Such a mechanism could then be viewed as a route to bring Las17 and its inherent actin - nucle - ating capacity to the site of membrane ﬁssion ( 54 ) . Coupled with the direct interaction between actin and dynamin , actin polymer - ization at the site of the invagination then either could directly drive scission or could be associated with subsequent movement of the released vesicle within the cytoplasm ( 24 , 29 ) . We have recently demonstrated that overexpression of an early endocytic protein , Ysc84 , that binds Las17 at a site overlapping Rvs167 can cause retractions in endocytosis similar to the rvs167 deletion , supportingthe invivo importanceoftheRvs167 - Las17interaction ( 55 ) . In mammalian cells , it is clear that phosphorylation in the C - terminal PRD region of dynamin is important for interactions with a number of endocytic proteins , including the BAR domain proteins amphiphysin and syndapin ( 32 , 34 , 36 , 56 – 58 ) . Dy - namin - 1 has been shown to be maintained with high phosphory - lation levels in resting cells , and membrane depolarization cou - pledwithactivationofthephosphatasecalcineurincandriverapiddephosphorylationandsubsequentendocytosis . In the cases of Vps1 and Rvs167 , the identity of the phosphatase is currently un - known . However , the essential type 1 phosphatase Glc7 has been shown to interact with , and be required for , dephosphorylation reactions of a number of proteins at the endocytic site ( 57 , 59 – 63 ) The S599 residue that we have studied here lies in the insert B region of Vps1 . Our previous data showing a PXXP SH3 binding motif in insert B , and the fact that we observe liposome binding in the absence of a PH domain , has led us to propose that insert B might be able to confer both lipid binding and SH3 binding func - tions on this dynamin protein . The S599V mutation reduces the interaction with Rvs167 in cells , indicating the importance of the S599 phosphorylation for SH3 domain binding . There was also a subtle but reproducible effect detected on the PIP strips caused by the S599D mutation , suggesting that phosphorylation in the re - gion might also modulate lipid binding . Given the identiﬁcation of other phosphorylation events within this region ( S570 and S579 ) , these might , alone or together , cause further lipid or pro - tein binding changes , and these possibilities will be the focus of future studies . It will also be of interest to determine whether the other phosphorylation events identiﬁed affect endocytosis or other distinct functions of the Vps1 protein . The more N - terminal phosphorylation sites identiﬁed lie in both the GTPase and the stalk domain . The threonine residues 242 and 247 in the GTPase domain were indicated to be high - conﬁdence phosphorylation sites in mass spectrometry analysis . These residues are highly con - served ( T200 and T205 in Dyn1 ) and may indicate that some regulatory sites could have been maintained throughout evolu - tion . Interestingly , residue T205 is part of the dynamin G4 loop that plays a critical role in the G - G domain dimerization ( 64 ) . Thus , phosphorylation at this site in yeast Vps1 and potentially in classical dynamins would likely have a signiﬁcant effect on the ability of the protein to form oligomers . Overall , our data indicate that phosphorylation is a key modi - ﬁcation allowing Vps1 to make distinct protein interactions that facilitate the progression of endocytosis .
