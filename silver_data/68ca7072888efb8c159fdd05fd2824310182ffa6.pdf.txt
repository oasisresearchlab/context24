Although nanotechnology - based drug - delivery systems are capable of improving the permeability and retention of chemotherapeutic drugs 3 – 5 , they still face the challenges of insufficient accumulation at the tumour site , and suboptimal extravasation and subsequent penetration into tumour parenchyma . In addition , highly tumori - genic tumour - repopulating cells ( TRCs ) are preferentially located within the hypoxic compartment located far from the tumour vessels in solid tumours 6 – 8 , which makes it more difficult for nano - technology - based drug - delivery systems to target TRCs . Extracellular vesicles , including exosomes and microparticles ( MPs ) , hold great potential as drug - delivery systems due to high biocompatibility , intrinsic targeting properties and low immunoge - nicity 9 – 11 . Unlike exosomes , which are smaller in size ( 30 – 100 nm ) and released from endosomes , MPs are a heterogeneous population ( 100 – 1 , 000 nm in size ) of extracellular vesicles released by many cell types in response to stimuli 12 , 13 . Recently , tumour - cell - derived MPs have been developed to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs with high anticancer efficacy without adverse side effects 14 , 15 . However , the anticancer activity of MP - based drug - delivery systems might be compromised by their large size . For example , unlike normal endothelial tight junctions , the intercellular openings of defective endothelial cells in tumour vessels range from 0 . 3 – 4 . 7 µ m ( ref . 16 ) , resulting in tremendous heterogeneity in tumour vessel leakage over space , time and different types of tumour 17 , 18 , thereby hamper - ing MPs extravasating from tumour vessels 19 , 20 . Furthermore , the compact extracellular matrix and elevated interstitial fluid pressure in tumour tissues might restrict MPs to limited penetration into tumour parenchyma 21 – 23 . Therefore , improving the delivery effi - ciency of MP - based drug carriers remains a big challenge . Mechanical softness is a pivotal feature in the delivery of drugs by nanoparticles , conferring nanoparticles the ability to accumu - late in large numbers at the tumour site and enhancing uptake by tumour cells 24 – 28 . Considering the high heterogenicity of vascular permeability within a tumour , it is reasonable to speculate that compared with stiff counterparts , soft particles have stronger abil - ity to cross blood vessels and penetrate deeply into tumour paren - chyma due to their deformability . Whether the softness of parental cells can be passed down to the released MPs , thus overcoming the shortcomings of MPs caused by large size , remains elusive . Recently , we developed a mechanics - based method to select TRCs with high drug resistance and tumorigenic potential by culturing single tumour cells in soft three - dimensional ( 3D ) fibrin gels of 90 Pa in stiffness 29 , 30 . These TRCs are much softer than their dif - ferentiated parental tumour cells 15 , 29 . It is known that the stiffness of cells should match the stiffness of the corresponding extracellu - lar matrix 31 . Consequently , seeding stiff differentiated tumour cells into the soft fibrin gels ( 90 Pa ) may lead to cell death . In contrast , seeding the soft TRCs into the soft fibrin gels results in cell growth and spheroid formation 29 . Adapting this mechanical feature , we can select and amplify TRCs for research . In this study , we found that MPs derived from these soft TRCs ( denoted as 3D - MPs ) are also softer and more deformable than MPs derived from differenti - ated tumour cells cultured in conventional rigid two - dimensional ( 2D ) plastics ( denoted as 2D - MPs ) , and such softness confers 3D - MPs the enhanced ability to deliver anticancer drugs by enhanced tumour accumulation , easy extravasation and penetra - tion into tumour tissue , and efficient internalization into TRCs . Mechanistically , cytospin - A—a cytoskeleton - related protein 32 — was identified to play a critical role in regulating the softness of 3D - MPs ( Fig . 1a ) . The softness of tumour - cell - derived microparticles regulates their drug - delivery efficiency Qingle Liang 1 , 8 , Nana Bie 1 , 8 , Tuying Yong 1 , 8 , Ke Tang 2 , Xiaolong Shi 3 , 4 , Zhaohan Wei 1 , Haibo Jia 5 , Xiaoqiong Zhang 1 , Haiyan Zhao 4 , Wei Huang 1 , Lu Gan 1 , 6 * , Bo Huang 2 , 7 * and Xiangliang Yang 1 , 6 * Extracellular microparticles ( MPs ) can function as drug - delivery vehicles for anticancer drugs . Here , we show that the soft - ness of MPs derived from tumour - repopulating cells ( TRCs ) isolated from three - dimensional fibrin gels enhances the MPs’ drug - delivery efficiency . We found that , compared with MPs derived from tumour cells cultured in conventional tissue - culture plastic , TRC - derived MPs intravenously injected in tumour - xenograft - bearing mice showed enhanced accumulation in tumour tissues , enhanced blood - vessel crossing and penetration into tumour parenchyma , and preferential uptake by highly tumorigenic TRCs . We also show that the cytoskeleton - related protein cytospin - A plays a critical role in the regulation of TRC - derived MP softness . The modulation of the mechanical properties of TRC - derived MPs could aid the efficiency of delivery of anticancer drugs .

In our previously reported soft 3D fibrin gel culture system 29 , 30 , TRCs were selected and ampli - fied at a small - scale level , thus limiting the large - scale preparation of TRCs that produce 3D - MPs . Here , murine hepatocarcinoma H22 TRCs cultured in soft 3D fibrin gels ( 90 Pa ) were isolated and then seeded in conventional 2D plates in serum - free medium containing 2 % B27 , 20 ng ml − 1 mouse epidermal growth factor ( mEGF ) and 1 % glutamine 33 . After expansion over 20 d , the cells multiplied by 2 , 000 - fold yet kept the original spheroid - forming ability ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Moreover , 100 such amplified cells were sufficient to produce a tumour in nude mice and wild - type BALB / c mice ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , suggesting that the amplification culture in serum - free medium had no obvious influence on the high tumorigenicity of TRCs . Thus , these propagated TRCs were used to prepare 3D - MPs in the following experiments . To confirm whether 3D - MPs , like 2D - MPs derived from the parental tumour cells , could encapsulate anticancer drug , H22 cells and expanded H22 TRCs were treated with 200 µ g ml − 1 doxoru - bicin ( DOX ) —an intrinsically fluorescent anticancer drug—fol - lowed by ultraviolet irradiation for MP induction . We found that DOX was effectively packaged by 2D - and 3D - MPs , as evidenced by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . MPs vary in size from 100 – 1 , 000 nm ( refs . 12 , 13 ) . Dynamic light scatter - ing ( DLS ) analysis revealed that DOX - packaging 2D - and 3D - MPs ( denoted as DOX @ 2D - MPs and DOX @ 3D - MPs , respectively ) dis - played similar diameters of ~ 513 and ~ 542 nm , with polydisper - sity indices of 0 . 375 and 0 . 343 , and zeta potentials of − 28 . 2 ± 0 . 8 and − 25 . 9 ± 0 . 3 mV ( Fig . 1c , d ) , respectively . Both DOX @ 2D - MPs and DOX @ 3D - MPs were monodisperse and irregularly spherical , as observed by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ; Fig . 1e ) . Further high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analysis showed that the drug loading capacity for both 2D - and 3D - MPs was 0 . 06 μ g of DOX per μ g protein ( MPs were quantified accord - ing to protein content ) . In addition , we found that a 7 - d incubation of DOX @ 2D - MPs or DOX @ 3D - MPs in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) with or without 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) did not cause changes to their diameters or zeta potentials ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , suggesting that DOX @ 2D - MPs and DOX @ 3D - MPs are relatively stable . DOX @ 2D - MPs and DOX @ 3D - MPs showed pH - responsive sustained drug - release profiles ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . A different anticancer drug , 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) , can also be encapsulated into 2D - and 3D - MPs ( denoted as 5 - FU @ 2D - MPs and 5 - FU @ 3D - MPs , respectively ) , and the loading efficiency was 0 . 04 μ g of 5 - FU per μ g of protein , as analysed by HPLC . Besides expanded H22 TRCs , other TRCs , such as murine melanoma B16 - F10 TRCs ( also expanded in serum - free medium containing 2 % B27 , 20 ng ml − 1 mEGF and 1 % glutamin ) could be used to prepare drug - packaging 3D - MPs ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Next , to explore whether drug - packaging 3D - MPs had the better antitumour effect , DOX @ 3D - MPs and DOX @ 2D - MPs were intra - venously injected into BALB / c mice bearing ~ 40 mm 3 H22 tumours . Compared with PBS , blank MPs and free DOX ( 0 . 5 mg kg − 1 ) , treat - ment with DOX @ 2D - MPs significantly halted the development and progression of the tumour mass , with 72 . 6 % tumour inhibi - tion ( Fig . 2a , b ) . However , DOX @ 3D - MPs exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect , achieving 91 . 5 % tumour shrinkage ( even better than Doxil ( pegylated liposomal DOX ) —a Food and Drug Administration - approved anticancer nanodrug ) at a DOX dosage of 4 mg kg − 1 ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Kaplan – Meier survival analysis showed that 75 % of mice were still alive in the DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated group after 63 d , when all mice in the other groups had died ( Fig . 2c ) . Further analysis of tumour tissues revealed the minimum proportion of Ki67 - positive proliferating tumour cells and the maximum proportion of caspase - 3 - positive apoptotic tumour cells in the DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated group ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . However , injection of a mixture of 3D - MPs and DOX did not result in a better antitumour effect compared with free DOX ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , suggesting that 3D - MPs themselves do not have a biological function that amplifies the anticancer effect of DOX . In addition , the anticancer effect of DOX @ 3D - MPs was also found in large H22 tumour - bearing mice with initial tumour sizes of 200 mm 3 ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Notably , we did not observe toxicity of DOX @ 3D - MPs , as evidenced by body weight ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) , haematoxylin and eosin staining of the major organs ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) , and serological analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . However , a high dosage of Doxil exhibited significant heart toxicity and haematotoxicity ( leukopenia ; Supplementary Fig . 9 – 11 ) , which might have been responsible for it not prolong - ing the survival time of H22 tumour - bearing mice ( Fig . 2c ) . Given that tumour - cell - derived MPs contain tumour - related biomole - cules , we also intravenously injected 2D - or 3D - MPs into mice six times to exclude the possible tumorigenicity . As expected , three months later , no tumours were detected in mice by small - animal positron emission tomography ( PET ; Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , sug - gesting that 3D - MPs as a drug carrier are safe . In addition , simi - lar to DOX @ 3D - MPs , 5 - FU @ 3D - MPs also showed highly efficient anticancer activity in H22 tumour - bearing mice compared with free 5 - FU and 5 - FU @ 2D - MPs at the same 5 - FU dosage of 0 . 5 mg kg − 1 — even better than free 5 - FU at a dosage of 10 mg kg − 1 ( Fig . 2d – f ) . To further assess the antitumour effect of drug - packaging 3D - MPs , we established a lung metastatic model by injecting 5 × 10 5 B16 - F10 melanoma cells into C57BL / 6 mice via the tail vein . At 24 h after injection , the mice were intravenously administrated with blank MPs , free DOX , DOX @ 2D - MPs , DOX @ 3D - MPs or a high dosage of Doxil , respectively . Significantly fewer metastatic nodules in the lungs , as evidenced by both the counting nodule number ( Fig . 2g and Supplementary Fig . 13a ) and haematoxylin and eosin stain - ing ( Supplementary Fig . 13b ) , and longer survival time ( Fig . 2h ) were achieved in the DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated group . Taken together , these results show that drug - packaging 3D - MPs have much better anticancer efficacy than their parental counterparts . Drug - packaging 3D - MPs possess enhanced ability to accumulate in tumours , with deep penetration . Ideal anticancer drug - delivery systems should be characterized by enhanced tumour accumu - lation and deep tumour penetration to efficiently reach tumour cells . To investigate the underlying mechanism through which 3D - MPs efficiently delivered antitumour drug , the DOX concen - tration in tumours of H22 tumour - bearing mice was evaluated at different time intervals after intravenous administration of free DOX , DOX @ 2D - MPs , DOX @ 3D - MPs or a high dosage of Doxil ( Fig . 3a ) . The area under the curve ( AUC ) of DOX concentration in the tumour over time was calculated to determine the relative differences in tumour accumulation of these formulations ( Fig . 3b ) . DOX @ 3D - MPs achieved the highest AUC values ( increases of about 38 . 9 - , 3 . 1 - and 6 . 7 - fold relative to free DOX , DOX @ 2D - MPs and Doxil , respectively ) , suggesting that 3D - MPs efficiently medi - ate DOX accumulation in tumour tissue . Intriguingly , less DOX was accumulated in the normal organs ( that is , the liver , spleen and lung ) of DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated mice than in the free DOX - , DOX @ 2D - MPs - or Doxil - treated group ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Next , we investigated the ability of DOX @ 3D - MPs to extravasate and penetrate into tumours . Some 24 h after intravenous injection of DOX , DOX @ 2D - MPs , DOX @ 3D - MPs or Doxil , tumour tissues were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - labelled CD31 antibody and imaged by confocal microscopy . The results showed that DOX was strongly colocalized with CD31 - positive tumour vessels in the DOX - , DOX @ 2D - MPs - and Doxil - treated groups , but weakly colocalized with tumour vessels in the DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated group ( Fig . 3c , d ) , suggesting that DOX @ 3D - MPs can NaTure BiomedicaL eNGiNeeriNG | VOL 3 | SEPTEMBER 2019 | 729 – 740 | www . nature . com / natbiomedeng 731 Articles NATuRE BioMEdiCAl ENgiNEERiNg 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time ( d ) Saline 2D - MPs 3D - MPs DOX DOX @ 2D - MPs DOX @ 3D - MPs High Doxil 0 10 20 40 60 80 100 0 20 40 60 80 100 Time ( d ) Saline 2D - MPs 3D - MPs 5 - FU High 5 - FU 5 - FU @ 2D - MPs 5 - FU @ 3D - MPs 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 200 400 600 800 1 , 000 1 , 200 1 , 400 Time ( d ) T u m ou r v o l u m e ( mm 3 ) Saline 2D - MPs 3D - MPs DOX High Doxil DOX @ 2D - MPs DOX @ 3D - MPs N S N S * * * * * * * * * N S N S * * * * * * * * * 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 200 400 600 800 Time ( d ) Saline 2D - MPs 3D - MPs 5 - FU 5 - FU @ 2D - MPs 5 - FU @ 3D - MPs High 5 - FU S a li n e 2 D - M P s 3 D - M P s D O X D O X @ 2 D - M P s D O X @ 3 D - M P s H i gh D o x il 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 T u m ou r w e i gh t ( g ) * * * * * * * * * NS P = 0 . 016 NS * * * S a li ne 2 D - M P s 3 D - M P s D O X D O X @ 2 D - M P s D O X @ 3 D - M P s H i gh D o x il 0 50 100 150 M e t a s t a t i c nodu l e s a b c d e f g h * * * P = 0 . 003 P = 0 . 004 NS P = 0 . 011 NS S a li ne 2 D - M P s 3 D - M P s 5 - F U 5 - F U @ 2 D - M P s 5 - F U @ 3 D - M P s H i gh 5 - F U 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 * * * P = 0 . 025 NS P = 0 . 046 NS * * * * * * Time ( d ) S u r v i v a l r a t e ( % ) Saline 2D - MPs 3D - MPs DOX DOX @ 2D - MPs DOX @ 3D - MPs High Doxil 0 10 20 40 60 80 0 20 40 60 80 100 T u m ou r v o l u m e ( mm 3 ) T u m ou r w e i gh t ( g ) S u r v i v a l r a t e ( % ) S u r v i v a l r a t e ( % ) Fig . 2 | antitumour activity of drug - packaging 3d - mPs . a , Tumour growth curves of H22 tumour - bearing mice after intravenous injection of free DOX , DOX @ 2D - MPs or DOX @ 3D - MPs at a DOX dosage of 0 . 5 mg kg − 1 once every other day ( total 6 times ) or Doxil at a DOX dosage of 4 mg kg − 1 once every other day ( total 4 times ) versus 2D - and 3D - MPs and saline .

To directly observe the extravasation and tumour penetration , we inserted a dorsal window chamber onto the skin of mice , and H22 tumour cells were implanted in the chamber . When the tumours were formed , the tumour vessels were labelled by intra - venous injection of fluorescein - labelled tomato lectin , followed by an injection of DOX , DOX @ 2D - MPs , DOX @ 3D - MPs or Doxil . The real - time observation under intravital confocal microscopy showed that although DOX was mainly retained within blood ves - sels 10 min after injection , it started to extravasate quickly from the blood vessels and distributed in the extravascular regions over time in the DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated group . In contrast , most DOX still remained within or around the blood vessels in the other groups ( Fig . 3e , f ) . Next , tg ( flk : EGFP ) transgenic zebrafish with green fluo - rescent ( enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) - expressing ) vessels were used as a model to further evaluate the extravasation and tumour penetration of DOX @ 3D - MPs .

To further validate the in vivo penetration result , an in vitro soft 3D fibrin gel tumour spheroid model was used . The seeded H22 tumour cells grew into round spheroids in the gels . After incubation with DOX , DOX @ 2D - MPs , DOX @ 3D - MPs or Doxil for four hours , the tumour spheroids were optically sectioned by confocal microscopy ( Supplementary Fig . 16 ) . We found that the fluorescence intensity of DOX in the DOX @ 3D - MPs group was much stronger than that in other groups at the section with the same depth . These results suggest that 3D - MPs possess enhanced ability to mediate DOX extravasation and penetration into tumour tissues . Drug - packaging 3D - MPs efficiently kill highly tumorigenic TRCs . After high accumulation and deep penetration into tumour parenchyma , anticancer drugs need to be efficiently internalized into tumour cells , especially highly tumorigenic TRCs , to achieve excel - lent anticancer activity . The in vitro incubation assay showed that DOX was more efficiently taken up by H22 TRCs in the DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated group compared with the free DOX - or DOX @ 2D - MPs - treated groups ( Supplementary Fig . 17a ) . Correspondingly , DOX @ 3D - MPs treatment resulted in the strongest cytotoxicity against H22 TRCs ( Supplementary Fig . 17b ) . Consistently , the strongest cytotoxicity was detected in DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated B16 - F10 TRCs compared with free DOX - or DOX @ 2D - MPs - treated TRCs ( Supplementary Fig . 17b ) . In addition , the highest DOX uptake was also observed in DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated H22 cells compared with free DOX - or DOX @ 2D - MPs - treated cells ( Supplementary Fig . 17c ) , leading to better killing of the tumour cells ( Supplementary Fig . 17d ) . Intracellular tracing analysis of DOX @ 3D - MPs indicated that 3D - MPs and DOX entered cancer cells together and then colocalized with lysosomes , followed by DOX translocation to the nuclei over time ( Supplementary Fig . 18 ) , consistent with our previous report 15 . Since more DOX was released from DOX @ 3D - MPs under lysosomal acidic pH ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , we conclude that DOX @ 3D - MPs release DOX in lysosomes to enter the nuclei to exert the cytotoxicity . Despite the strong kill - ing of tumour cells , DOX @ 2D - MPs and DOX @ 3D - MPs exhibited less cytotoxicity against RAW264 . 7 macrophages ( Supplementary Fig . 19a ) and human umbilical vein endothelial ECV304 cells ( Supplementary Fig . 19b ) compared with free DOX . The tumour cell targeting of DOX @ 3D - MPs was further verified in vivo , as evi - denced by the fact that the strongest DOX fluorescence was detected in the tumour cells of green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - expressing H22 tumour - bearing mice compared with tumour macrophages , stromal cells and other immune cells ( Supplementary Fig . 20 ) . Correspondingly , DOX @ 3D - MPs exhibited less cytotoxicity to tumour macrophages and endothelial cells compared with tumour cells in vivo ( Supplementary Fig . 21 ) . The above data show that 3D - MPs efficiently mediated DOX accumulation and penetration into the tumour tissue , and could be taken up by TRCs . We thus wondered whether penetrated DOX @ 3D - MPs could target TRCs , which are thought to be located within the hypoxic site far from tumour vessels 6 – 8 . Consistent with the previously reported hypoxia - inducible factor - 1 α stain - ing 35 , we also found that hypoxia was mainly located in the cen - tre of H22 tumours ( Supplementary Fig . 22 ) . When we isolated single tumour cells from central and peripheral tumour tissues and seeded them into the soft 3D fibrin gels ( 90 Pa ) , much greater colony numbers and larger colony sizes were formed by the cen - tral tumour cells ( Supplementary Fig . 23 ) , suggesting that TRCs are indeed preferably located at the site far away from blood ves - sels . Side population cells are known to enrich stem - like tumour cells , which contain TRCs 36 , 37 . As expected , the strongest intracel - lular DOX fluorescence and the highest DOX - positive cell numbers in tumour cells ( Supplementary Fig . 24a , b ) and side population cells ( Supplementary Fig . 24c , d ) were found in GFP - expressing H22 tumour - bearing mice at 24 h after intravenous injection of DOX @ 3D - MPs compared with free DOX - , DOX @ 2D - MPs - or a high dosage of Doxil . If we treated H22 tumour - bearing mice with free DOX , DOX @ 2D - MPs or DOX @ 3D - MPs at a DOX dosage of 0 . 5 mg kg − 1 once every other day ( total 6 times ) or a high dosage of Doxil at 4 mg kg − 1 once every other day ( total 4 times ) , the low - est proportion of side population cells was found in the DOX @ 3D - MPs - treated group ( Supplementary Fig . 24e ) . Meanwhile , much smaller colony numbers and colony sizes were formed in soft 3D fibrin gels ( 90 Pa ) by the central tumour cells of mice treated with DOX @ 3D - MPs compared with free DOX - , DOX @ 2D - MPs - or Doxil ( Supplementary Fig . 24f , g ) . However , drug - free 3D - MPs treatment did not have such effect ( Supplementary Fig . 24e – g ) . In addition to H22 tumours , similar results were obtained in the lung metastatic B16 - F10 melanoma ( Supplementary Fig . 25 ) . Together , these results suggest that penetrated drug - packaging 3D - MPs can efficiently target and kill tumorigenic TRCs . Softness confers 3D - MPs the enhanced abilities of tumour accu - mulation , penetration and TRC uptake . Physiochemical proper - ties , including size 21 – 23 , surface charge 38 , shape 39 and softness 24 – 28 , fundamentally influence the drug - delivery efficiency of nanopar - ticles . Although size , surface charge and shape did not show signifi - cant differences between 2D - and 3D - MPs ( Fig . 1c – e ) , using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) analysis , we found that 3D - MPs had a lower Young’s modulus than 2D - MPs ( Supplementary Fig . 26 ) , sug - gesting that 3D - MPs are softer than 2D - MPs . Moreover , we evalu - ated the softness of MPs by putting them into low ( by adding water ) or high ( by adding dextran ) osmotic PBS solution for 10 min and then measuring their sizes . The sizes of 3D - MPs were significantly larger under low osmotic conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 27a ) but significantly smaller under high osmotic conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 27b ) than those of 2D - MPs , further confirming that 3D - MPs are much softer and more deformable than 2D - MPs . To verify whether the softness of MPs contributed to the above 3D - MPs - mediated highly efficient delivery , we employed jasplakinolide ( Jasp ; an agent for actin polymerization and sta - bility 34 , 40 ) and latrunculin A ( LatA ; an agent for actin depolymeriza - tion and instability 41 ) , to regulate the softness of MPs . We found that soft 3D - MPs became stiffer after Jasp treatment , and stiff 2D - MPs became softer after LatA treatment ( Fig . 4a ) . Consistently , 3D - MPs ( compared with 2D - MPs ) exhibited enhanced tumour accumula - tion ( Fig . 4b ) , easy extravasation and tumour penetration ( Fig . 4c , d and Supplementary Fig . 28 ) , and efficient internalization by tumour cells ( Fig . 4e and supplementary Fig . 29a ) and side population cells ( Fig . 4f and supplementary Fig . 29b ) after being intravenously injected into H22 tumour - bearing mice . Jasp treatment resulted in significantly reduced tumour accumulation and penetration of 3D - MPs , as well as cellular uptake by tumour cells and side popu - lation cells , while LatA treatment significantly enhanced tumour accumulation and penetration of 2D - MPs , as well as cellular uptake by tumour cells and side population cells ( Fig . 4b – f and supplemen - tary Figs . 28 and 29 ) . In line with the in vivo results , Jasp - treated 3D - MPs decreased but LatA - treated 2D - MPs increased penetra - tion into 3D tumour spheroids ( Supplementary Fig . 30 ) and cellu - lar uptake by TRCs ( Supplementary Fig . 31 ) in a tumour spheroid model . Taken together , these results suggest that 3D - MPs mobilize mechanical softness , which facilitates the accumulation and pen - etration of DOX into tumour parenchyma , and uptake by TRCs . Intriguingly , relative to 2D - MPs , fewer 3D - MPs were taken up by RAW264 . 7 macrophages ( Supplementary Fig . 32a ) . However , Jasp treatment could increase the uptake of 3D - MPs by macrophages , while LatA treatment decreased the uptake of 2D - MPs by mac - rophages ( Supplementary Fig . 32b ) , suggesting that unlike soft MPs , which are easily taken up by tumour cells , stiff MPs are more NaTure BiomedicaL eNGiNeeriNG | VOL 3 | SEPTEMBER 2019 | 729 – 740 | www . nature . com / natbiomedeng 734 Articles NATuRE BioMEdiCAl ENgiNEERiNg easily taken up by macrophages . This probably explains why fewer DOX @ 3D - MPs than DOX @ 2D - MPs were accumulated in the organs with phagocyte - enriched reticuloendothelial systems , such as the liver , spleen and lungs ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . The softness of 3D - MPs is regulated by downregulation of cytospin - A . We then investigated the mechanism through which TRCs generate soft MPs . Given that softness / stiffness is controlled by the mechanical properties of MPs—especially the cytoskeletal arrangements 42 , 43 —we analysed the protein expression profiles of 2D - and 3D - MPs using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification ( iTRAQ ) - based proteome analysis 44 . The proteins of 2D - and 3D - MPs were digested and then labelled with an 8 - plex iTRAQ , followed by analysis by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry . In total , 784 differentially expressed proteins were detected , among which 326 were upregulated ( the threshold was set at 1 . 2 ; Supplementary Data 1 ) and 458 were downregulated ( the threshold was set at 0 . 83 ; Supplementary Data 2 ) in 3D - MPs compared with 2D - MPs . We then narrowed the differentially expressed proteins down to cytoskeleton - related ones . Cytospin - A , colocalized with both tubulin and actin that regulate actin cyto - skeleton reorganization 32 , was listed as one of the top candidates 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + La t A 3 D - M P s 3 D - M P s + J a s p 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + La t A 3 D - M P s 3 D - M P s + J a s p 0 1 2 3 4 Y oung ' s m odu l u s ( k P a ) * * * * * * * * * 10 30 60 90 120 0 10 20 30 40 Time ( min ) R e l a t i v e e x t r a v a sc u l a r D i I ( % V m a x ) 2D - MPs 2D - MPs + LatA 3D - MPs 3D - MPs + Jasp * * * a b c d e f 10 min 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + La t A 3 D - M P s 3 D - M P s + J a s p 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + La t A 3 D - M P s 3 D - M P s + J a s p 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 C F SE M F I P = 0 . 007 P = 0 . 001 P = 0 . 034 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + La t A 3 D - M P s 3 D - M P s + J a s p 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 2 , 500 D i I M F I i n G F P + t u m ou r c e ll s * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * D i I M F I i n G F P + SP c e ll s Fig . 4 | role of softness on the in vivo transport process of 3d - mPs . a , Young’s modulus values of 3D - MPs treated with or without 50 nM Jasp for 12 h and 2D - MPs treated with or without 50 nM LatA for 1 h , as measured by AFM .

Indeed , the expression of cytospin - A in 3D - MPs was lower than in 2D - MPs , as evidenced by western blot ( Supplementary Fig . 33 ) . Consistently , cytospin - A expression was also downregulated in H22 TRCs compared with the H22 counter - parts ( Supplementary Fig . 33 ) , which prompted us to hypothesize that cytospin - A was involved in regulation of the softness of MPs . To test this hypothesis , we transfected H22 cells with cytospin - A small interfering ( siRNA ) to knock down cytospin - A expression , which also resulted in the downregulation of cytospin - A in the 2D - MPs derived from these cells ( Supplementary Fig . 34 ) . Correspondingly , knocking down cytospin - A decreased the Young’s modulus of 2D - MPs nearly to that of 3D - MPs ( Fig . 5a ) . When we injected these softened 2D - MPs into H22 tumour - bearing mice , enhanced tumour accumulation ( Fig . 5b ) , extravasation and tumour penetration ( Fig . 5c , d and Supplementary Fig . 35 ) , as well as uptake by tumour cells ( Fig . 5e and Supplementary Fig . 36a ) and side population cells 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + c on t r o l s i R N A 2 D - M P s + cy t o s p i n - A s i R N A 3 D - M P s 0 1 2 3 4 Y oung ' s m odu l u s ( k P a ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + c on t r o l s i R N A 2 D - M P s + cy t o s p i n - A s i R N A 3 D - M P s 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 4 , 000 C F SE M F I a b d e 10 min 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + c on t r o l s i R N A 2 D - M P s + cy t o s p i n - A s i RN A 3 D - M P s 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + c on t r o l s i R N A 2 D - M P s + cy t o s p i n - A s i R N A 3 D - M P s 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 4 , 000 D il M F I i n G F P + SP c e ll s c f 10 30 60 90 120 0 10 20 30 Time ( min ) R e l a t i v e e x t r a v a sc u l a r D i I ( % V m a x ) 2D - MPs 2D - MPs + control siRNA 2D - MPs + cytospin - A siRNA 3D - MPs * * * 2 D - M P s 2 D - M P s + c on t r o l s i R N A 2 D - M P s + cy t o s p i n - A s i R N A 3 D - M P s 0 1 , 000 2 , 000 3 , 000 D i I M F I i n G F P + t u m ou r c e ll s * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Fig . 5 | involvement of cytospin - a in the regulation of softness and in vivo transport process of 3d - mPs . a , Young’s modulus values of MPs derived from H22 TRCs and H22 cells transfected with or without cytospin - A siRNA or control siRNA .

However , 2D - MPs derived from control siRNA - transfected H22 cells displayed a similar in vivo transport process to 2D - MPs derived from H22 cells ( Fig . 5b – f ) . These results reveal that cytospin - A plays an important role in regulation of the softness of MPs and their in vivo transport process , which might affect the therapeutic effects during drug delivery . In line with the above cytospin - A - regulated in vivo trans - port process of MPs in tumour masses , tumour accumulation ( Supplementary Fig . 37a ) , extravasation and tumour penetration ( Supplementary Fig . 37b , c ) , and uptake of DOX by tumour cells ( Supplementary Fig . 37d , e ) and side population cells ( Supplementary Fig . 37f , g ) in H22 tumour - bearing mice intravenously adminis - trated with DOX - packaging 2D - MPs derived from cytospin - A siRNA - transfected H22 cells ( denoted as DOX @ 2D - MPs + cyto - spin - A siRNA ) were significantly increased compared with those administered with DOX - packaging 2D - MPs derived from H22 cells transfected with control siRNA ( denoted as DOX @ 2D - MPs + con - trol siRNA ) . Correspondingly , DOX @ 2D - MPs + cytospin - A siRNA showed significantly stronger antitumour activity compared with DOX @ 2D - MPs + control siRNA and DOX @ 2D - MPs , similar to DOX @ 3D - MPs ( Fig . 6a – c ) . Furthermore , smaller colony num - bers ( Fig . 6d ) and colony sizes ( Fig . 6e ) were formed when cen - tral tumour cells of H22 tumour - bearing mice administrated with DOX @ 2D - MPs + cytospin - A siRNA were seeded in soft 3D fibrin gels ( 90 Pa ) compared with DOX @ 2D - MPs + control siRNA or DOX @ 2D - MPs , revealing the stronger TRC - killing efficacy of DOX @ 2D - MPs + cytospin - A siRNA . Overall , these results strongly show that the superior anticancer activity of anticancer drug - packaging 3D - MPs might be due to low cytospin - A expression in 3D - MPs , which results in greater softness and their subsequent excellent in vivo transport .

This leads to effective suicide - like killing of TRCs , and subsequently an ideal treatment outcome . The cytospin - A - associated softness of 3D - MPs plays an important role in the regulation of their in vivo transport process . These findings reveal a new aspect of the biology of MPs that suggests better strategies for drug delivery in cancer therapy . methods Cell lines and animals . The murine hepatocarcinoma cell line H22 and murine RAW264 . 7 macrophage cell line were purchased from the China Centre for Type Culture Collection . The murine melanoma cell line B16 - F10 was purchased from the Cell Resource Center of Peking Union Medical College . The cells were cultured in a conventional 2D rigid dish containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS in a 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37 °C . Male BALB / c and female C57BL / 6 mice ( 18 ± 2 g ; 6 – 8 weeks old ) were purchased from the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention and maintained in a sterile environment at 22 °C under a 12 h light – dark cycle and with free access to food and water . The H22 tumour - bearing mouse model was constructed by subcutaneously injecting 2 × 10 6 H22 cells into the flanks of BALB / c mice . The melanoma metastasis mouse model was constructed by intravenously injecting 5 × 10 5 B16 - F10 cells into the tail vein of C57BL / 6 mice . All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Tongji Medical College , Huazhong University of Science and Technology . Large - scale culture of TRCs in vitro . TRCs were selected in soft 3D fibrin gels ( 90 Pa ) as described 15 , 29 . Briefly , parental tumour cells ( including H22 and B16 - F10 cells ) were maintained in the conventional 2D rigid plates . After digestion with 0 . 25 % trypsin into a single - cell suspension of 1 × 10 4 cells ml − 1 , the fibrinogen / cell mixtures were acquired by mixing 2 mg ml − 1 fibrinogen ( diluted with T7 buffer containing 50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl at pH 7 . 4 ) with the same volume of cell suspension . Fibrinogen / cell mixtures ( 250 µ l ) were then seeded into each well of a 24 - well plate pre - added with 5 µ l thrombin ( 0 . 1 U µ l − 1 ) and mixed well . The plate was incubated in a cell culture incubator for 30 min and then 1 ml DMEM medium containing 10 % FBS was added . On day 5 , the spheroids were harvested and digested with 0 . 4 % ( w / v ) dispase II for 10 min at 37 °C , followed by pipetting to single cells . To propagate TRCs , the cells selected from soft 3D fibrin gels were cultured in serum - free DMEM / F - 12 medium supplemented with 2 % B27 , 20 ng ml − 1 mEGF and 1 % glutamine , and passaged for 5 generations for subsequent experiments . Preparation and characterization of drug - packaging MPs . TRCs ( including H22 and B16 - F10 TRCs ) and their parental tumour cells were treated with 200 µ g ml − 1 DOX or 5 - FU , then subjected to ultraviolet irradiation ( UVB ; 300 J m − 2 ) for 1 h . After 12 h incubation , the supernatants were first centrifuged at 600 g for 10 min and 14 , 000 g for 2 min to remove debris . The supernatants were further centrifuged at 14 , 000 g for 60 min to harvest drug - loaded TRC - derived 3D - MPs and drug - loaded parental tumour - cell - derived 2D - MPs , respectively 14 , 15 . The pellets were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in cell culture medium for the following experiments . The blank MPs were prepared according to the same protocol , except no anticancer drug was added . MPs were labelled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ) , PKH26 or DiI by incubating them with CFSE ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ; 5 µ M in PBS ; 30 min ) , PKH26 ( Sigma – Aldrich ; 2 µ M in Diluent C ; 5 min ) or DiI ( Biotium ; 5 µ M in PBS ; 15 min ) , followed by washing with PBS 3 times to remove the unbound dye . The concentration of anticancer drug in MPs was measured by HPLC . Chromatography was performed on a Hypersil ODS - 2 column ( 250 mm × 4 . 6 mm ; 5 μ m ) . The mobile phases used for DOX and 5 - FU separation were acetonitrile - water ( 32 : 68 ) and methanol - water ( 10 : 90 ) , respectively . The effluents were monitored at 254 nm for DOX and 265 nm for 5 - FU . The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of drug - loaded MPs were measured by DLS ( Zetasizer Nano ZS90 ; Malvern Instruments ) . Their morphology was observed by TEM ( Tecnai G2 20 ; FEI ) with an accelerating voltage of 60 kV . Tumour treatment experiments . H22 tumour - bearing mice were intravenously injected with PBS , MPs , free drug or drug - packaging MPs ( the drug dosage was equivalent to 0 . 5 mg DOX or 5 - FU per kg , and the MP dosage was normalized using the same amounts of protein ) once every other day for a total of 6 times , respectively . The sizes of tumours and body weights of mice were measured every day . On day 13 after treatment , some of the mice were sacrificed . The tumours were harvested for Ki67 and caspase - 3 staining analysis , and the major organs ( the heart , liver , spleen , lungs and kidneys ) were harvested for haematoxylin and eosin staining analysis . The rest of the mice were kept for long - term survival observation . For the metastatic model , B16 - F10 cells ( 5 × 10 5 cells per mouse ) were injected into the tail vein of female C57BL / 6 mice . Some 24 h after tumour cell inoculation , the tumour - bearing mice were intravenously injected with PBS , MPs , free DOX or DOX - loaded MPs ( equivalent to a DOX dosage of 0 . 5 mg kg − 1 ) once every other day for a total of 6 times . On day 21 after treatment , some of the mice were sacrificed and the lungs were collected for the counting of metastatic tumour nodules , and haematoxylin and eosin staining analysis . The rest of the mice were kept for the study of long - term survival . Small - animal PET imaging . BALB / c mice were intravenously injected with 2D - MPs or 3D - MPs at a dosage of 8 . 3 mg protein kg − 1 once every other day for a total of 6 times . Then , the mice were fed normally for three months , followed by small - animal PET examination . Briefly , before PET imaging , the mice were fasted for 12 h and then intravenously injected with approximately 200 ± 10 μ Ci 18 - fluoro - 6 - deoxy - glucose ( FDG ) . At 60 min after the administration of 18 - fluoro - 6 - deoxy - glucose , the mice were anaesthetized with 2 % isoflurane and placed on a scanning bed . Images were obtained with the whole body pattern ( static scan ; 2 bed positions ; 7 min per bed position ) using a Trans - PET BioCalibure 700 system ( Raycan Technology ) . The PET images were reconstructed using the 3D ordered subset expectation maximization ( OSEM ) method with a voxel size of 0 . 5 × 0 . 5 × 0 . 5 mm 3 . Images were displayed with the software Carimas ( Turku PET Centre ) . The mean standardized uptake value was calculated using the following formula : mean pixel value with the decay - corrected region - of - interest activity ( μ Ci kg − 1 ) / ( injected dose ( μ Ci ) / weight ( kg ) ) . Bio - distribution . H22 tumour - bearing mice were intravenously injected with free DOX or DOX - loaded MPs at a DOX dosage of 0 . 75 mg kg − 1 , or Doxil at a DOX dosage of 4 mg kg − 1 . At the predetermined time points , the mice were sacrificed , and the tumour tissues and major organs ( the heart , liver , spleen , lungs and kidneys ) were collected . The tissues were homogenized in 100 µ l PBS , then mixed with 200 µ l of methanol for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark to extract DOX . The mixtures were centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min , and 100 μ l of the supernatant was used for DOX fluorescence determination on a FlexStation 3 Multi - Mode Microplate Reader ( Molecular Devices ) at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 560 nm . The calibration curves were generated by adding increasing amounts of DOX to the corresponding tissues and extracting DOX using the same protocol as described above . The DOX concentration in the tumour versus time curves were fitted using GraphPad Prism 6 , and the linear trapezoidal method was used to calculate the AUC values . Extravasation and tumour penetration in vivo . H22 tumour - bearing mice were intravenously injected with free DOX or DOX - loaded MPs at a DOX dosage of 0 . 75 mg kg − 1 , or CFSE - labelled MPs at an MP dosage of 5 mg protein kg − 1 , respectively . At 24 h after injection , the mice were sacrificed and the tumours were excised , washed with PBS and sectioned by cryotomy . The sections were incubated with FITC - or Alexa Fluor 594 - conjugated CD31 antibody ( Abcam ) at 37 °C for 30 min , washed with PBS and then detected using a FV1000 confocal microscope ( Olympus ) . The fluorescence of DOX or CFSE was quantified using imageJ version 2 . 0 . 0 software , and the penetration capacity was expressed as the ratio of DOX or CFSE in the tumour parenchyma to that within the blood vessels . Extravasation and tumour penetration analysis using the dorsal window chamber model . Dorsal window chamber imaging was performed as previously described 45 . Briefly , BALB / c mice were anaesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine and xylazine at dosages of 100 and 10 mg kg − 1 , respectively . Titanium window frames ( APJ Trading ) were implanted onto the backs of the mice . One side of the skin in the frame was peeled approximately 1 cm in diameter and the other side remained intact . H22 tumour cells ( 5 × 10 5 cells resuspended in 25 μ l PBS ) were then injected into the fascia of the intact skin . After inoculation of the tumour cells , a 10 - mm - diameter coverslip was covered and fixed on the peeled skin . When tumours reached ~ 5 mm in diameter in the dorsal window chamber models , the mice were intravenously injected with free DOX or DOX - loaded MPs at a DOX dosage of 0 . 75 mg kg − 1 , or DiI - labelled MPs at an MP dosage of 5 mg protein kg − 1 , respectively . The tumour imaging was started within 10 min postadministration under an LSM 780 NLO upright microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a 20 × water immersion objective . The vasculature was labelled with 50 µ l of fluorescein - labelled tomato lectin ( Vector laboratories ; 2 mg ml − 1 ) 30 min before imaging , and the vessels were visualized using an argon laser ( 488 nm ) . The extravasation of DOX and DiI was monitored using a diode - pumped solid - state laser ( 561 nm ) . All images were analysed using LSM image software ( Carl Zeiss ) . During imaging , the mice were anaesthetized by inhalation of 1 . 0 – 3 . 0 % isoflurane in oxygen flow using a Matrx VMS small - animal anaesthesia machine ( Midmark ) , immobilized on an aluminium window chamber mount , and heated on a warmer plate ( Thermo Plate ; Tokai Hit ) . The DOX or DiI fluorescence intensity was quantified using imageJ version 2 . 0 . 0 software , and the penetration capacity was expressed as the extravascular DOX or DiI fluorescence normalized by the maximum DOX or DiI fluorescence within the blood vessels at 10 min postinjection .

At 48 h after transfection , the cells and released MPs were harvested . Elasticity measurement by AFM . 3D - and 2D - MPs were harvested from H22 TRCs and their parental tumour cells , respectively . 3D - MPs treated with or without 50 nM Jasp for 12 h , or 2D - MPs treated with or without 50 nM LatA for 1 h were adhered to the surface of megohmit coated with 0 . 05 mg ml − 1 poly - lysine , and their elasticity was determined in PBS medium at room temperature by AFM . A multimode 8 AFM ( Bruker ) with an inverted optical microscope was used for AFM imaging . The type of probe was ScanAsyst - Fluid + ( Bruker ) and a cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 0 . 7 N m − 1 was used . All AFM images and measurements were obtained in tapping mode in liquid . The scanning rate was 0 . 6 Hz . The force curves were measured using the same cantilever in shooting mode , with the Z piezo working in a closed loop . For the imaging of each MP , 10 – 15 shooting target measurements were averaged and the errors were estimated . The Young’s modulus of the MPs was calculated by applying the Sneddon - modified Hertz model 47 : π φδ = − F E v 2 1 tan 2 2 where δ is the indentation depth , φ is the half - opening angle of the AFM tip , E is the relative Young’s modulus , F is the applied loading force and V is the Poisson ratio ( with a value of 0 . 5 in this equation ) .

Methodology Sample preparation For the determination of intracellular accumulation in tumour cells and immune cells , the tumour tissues were cut into small pieces , and digested with 1 mg / mL collagenase type I for 2 h with persistent agitation . The cells were collected by centrifugation at 300g for 5 min , washed twice with PBS and then filtered twice by a 40 μ m filter . Lymphocytes were isolated using Ficoll - Paque PLUS . For determination of the intracellular accumulation in side population cells , the digested tumour cells were stained with 5 μ g / mL Hoechest 33342 for 90 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 50 μ M verapamil , washed twice with PBS and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis . Instrument For flow - cytometry analysis , all events were acquired on a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX S or a Beckman Coulter FC500 . Software The software used for collecting and analyzing was Beckman Coulter cytExpert 2 . 0 . 0 . 153 and CXP Cytometer 2 . 3 . Cell population abundance No cell sorting was performed . Gating strategy For determination of side population cells ratio , briefly , single cells were selected using forward and side scatter linearity . Dual - wavelength FACS analysis identified a side branch of ‘Hoechst - low’ cells as the side population cells , which was further verified by co - adding verapamil , showing a reduction in the size of side population cells . CD4 + T cells analysis : CD4 + T cells were identified as CD45 + , CD3 + , CD4 + . CD8 + T cells analysis : CD8 + T cells were identified as CD45 + , CD3 + , CD8 + .
