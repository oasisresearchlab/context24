M610873200 Mitsuharu Endo , Kazumasa Ohashi , and Kensaku Mizuno 1 From the Department of Biomolecular Sciences , Graduate School of Life Sciences , Tohoku University , Sendai , Miyagi 980 - 8578 , Japan Cofilin and its closely related protein , actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics that have been implicated in growth cone motility and neurite extension . Cofilin / ADF are inactivated by LIM kinase ( LIMK ) - catalyzed phosphorylation and reactivated by Slingshot ( SSH ) - catalyzed dephosphorylation . Here we examined the roles of cofilin / ADF , LIMKs ( LIMK1 and LIMK2 ) , and SSHs ( SSH1 and SSH2 ) in nerve growth factor ( NGF ) - induced neurite extension . Knockdown of cofilin / ADF by RNA interference almost com - pletely inhibited NGF - induced neurite extension from PC12 cells , and double knockdown of SSH1 / SSH2 significantly sup - pressed both NGF - induced cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation and neurite extension from PC12 cells , thus indicating that cofilin / ADF and their activating phosphatases SSH1 / SSH2 are critical for neurite extension . Interestingly , NGF stimulated the activi - ties of both LIMK1 and LIMK2 in PC12 cells , and suppression of LIMK1 / LIMK2 expression or activity significantly reduced NGF - induced neurite extension from PC12 cells or chick dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons . Inhibition of LIMK1 / LIMK2 activityreducedactinfilamentassemblyintheperipheralregion of the growth cone of chick DRG neurons . These results suggest that proper regulation of cofilin / ADF activities through control of phosphorylation by LIMKs and SSHs is critical for neurite extension and that LIMKs regulate actin filament assembly at the tip of the growth cone . The regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics plays a funda - mental role in cell shape change , motility , and migration in response to stimuli . In neurons , actin filaments accumulate at the distal tip of the growth cone in the growing neurite , and actin filament dynamics and reorganization are essential for controlling growth cone motility and morphology and deter - mining the direction and speed of neurite extension ( 1 – 4 ) . Cofilin and its closely related protein , actin depolymerizing fac - tor ( ADF ) , 2 are key mediators of actin filament dynamics that act by stimulating the depolymerization and severing of actin filaments ( 5 ) . The activities of cofilin and ADF are inhibited by phosphorylation at Ser - 3 by LIM kinases ( LIMKs , composed of LIMK1 and LIMK2 ) ( 6 , 7 ) and TES kinases ( TESKs , composed of TESK1 and TESK2 ) ( 8 ) ; the inactive Ser - 3 - phosphorylated cofilin and ADF ( P - cofilin / P - ADF ) are reactivated by dephos - phorylation by Slingshot ( SSH ) family protein phosphatases ( SSH1 , SSH2 , and SSH3 ) ( 9 , 10 ) and chronophin ( a haloacid dehalogenase ) ( 11 ) . Because cofilin / ADF and their upstream regulators , LIMKs and SSHs , are abundant in neuronal growth cones ( 12 – 15 ) , these proteins have been implicated in the con - trol of neurite extension and guidance through regulating actin filament dynamics . Neurotrophins are known to regulate neurite outgrowth and guidance ( 2 ) . Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells have been often used as a model system to investigate nerve growth factor ( NGF ) - induced neurite outgrowth . NGF induces cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation in PC12 cells ( 16 ) , and overexpression of cofilin / ADF or SSH1 enhances neurite extension from PC12 cells and primary cultured neurons , such as chick dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) or rat cortical neurons ( 13 , 17 ) . In contrast , overexpression of LIMK1 in neurons suppresses growth cone motility and extension ( 13 ) . In addition , the growth cone col - lapse induced by semaphorin - 3A ( a repulsive guidance mole - cule ) or Nogo - 66 ( a myelin - associated inhibitor of axon regen - eration ) requires transient activation of LIMK1 and cofilin phosphorylation in chick DRG neurons ( 18 , 19 ) . These results suggest that LIMK1 acts as a negative regulator of neurite out - growth by inhibiting cofilin / ADF activity . However , recent studies have suggested that LIMK1 has a seemingly opposite function on neurite outgrowth : neurite extension from hip - pocampal neurons was enhanced by LIMK1 expression and suppressed by blockade of LIMK1 activation ( 14 , 20 – 22 ) . Thus , further studies are required to understand the role of LIMK1 in neurite extension . In this study , we examined the roles of cofilin / ADF and its phosphoregulation in neurite extension by knocking down the expression of cofilin / ADF , LIMK1 / LIMK2 , and SSH1 / SSH2 using small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) . Knockdown of cofilin / ADF markedly blocked NGF - induced neurite extension of PC12 cells , and knockdown of SSH1 / SSH2 suppressed NGF - induced cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation and neurite extension , indicating that SSH1 / SSH2 - mediated cofilin / ADF dephospho - rylation is crucial for neurite extension . LIMK1 and LIMK2 were also activated after NGF stimulation of PC12 cells , and knockdown of LIMK1 / LIMK2 significantly suppressed NGF - induced neurite extension from PC12 cells and chick DRG neu - rons . Our results indicate that both LIMK1 / LIMK2 - mediated * Thisworkwassupportedbyagrant - inaidforscientificresearchfromtheMin - istryofEducation , Culture , Science , SportsandTechnologyofJapan .

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials —K252a , U73122 , and wortmannin were pur - chased from Calbiochem ( La Jolla , CA ) . Latrunculin A was from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . Rabbit polyclonal anti - bodies against rat / mouse ADF and SSH2 were generated against the C - terminal peptide of rat / mouse ADF and SSH2 , respectively . Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cofilin , P - co - filin , LIMK1 ( C10 ) , and SSH1 were prepared as described pre - viously ( 8 , 23 , 24 ) . Rabbit polyclonal antibody against LIMK2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . S3 and RV peptides were designed and synthesized as described previously ( 18 , 25 ) .

We also used the second siRNA sequences ( termed siRNA2 ) targeting rat and chick LIMKs as follows : 5 (cid:1) - GAAGGACTACTGGGCCCGC - 3 (cid:1) ( rat LIMK1 ) , 5 (cid:1) - GTGAAAGAGGTCAACCGGA - 3 (cid:1) ( rat LIMK2 ) , 5 (cid:1) - GTTC - ATCGGAGTGCTTTAC - 3 (cid:1) ( chick LIMK1 ) , and 5 (cid:1) - GGACA - AGAAGCTCAATCTC - 3 (cid:1) ( chick LIMK2 ) . As a control , we used a non - targeting sequence , 5 (cid:1) - TCTTCCCCCAAGAAAG - ATA - 3 (cid:1) , which does not exist in the rat or chick genome . Expres - sion plasmids coding for N - terminally Myc - tagged chick LIMK1 ( chLIMK1 ) and chLIMK2 and C - terminally Myc - tagged chick cofilin and ADF were constructed by inserting their full - length cDNAs into pMyc - C1 or pcDNA3 . 1 / Myc - His ( (cid:2) ) mammalian expression vector containing the Myc epitope tag ( 13 , 27 ) . Expres - sion plasmid ( pEYFP - C1 ) coding for yellow fluorescent protein ( YFP ) was purchased from Clontech . Cell Culture and Electroporation —PC12 cells were main - tained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum . Cells were plated in poly - L - lysine - coated dishes . For the RNA interference experiments , cells were mixed with pSUPER constructs in Opti - minimum essen - tial medium and electroporated at 320 V and 975 (cid:1) F using a Gene Pulser II ( Bio - Rad ) . After recovery , the cells were selected by incubation with puromycin ( 3 (cid:1) g / ml ) for 2 days and then used for further analysis . Chick DRG explants were cultured as described previously ( 13 ) . For siRNA experiments for chick DRG neurons , we used the chick Neuron Nucleofector Kit ( Amaxa , Gaithersburg , MD ) , according to the manufacture’s instructions . Briefly , chick DRGs were dissected from E7 – 8 chick embryos and digested with 0 . 25 % trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C . Dissociated cells were centrifuged and resuspended in nucleofection solution , mixed with 3 (cid:1) g of pSUPER plasmid and 1 (cid:1) g of YFP plasmid and electroporated using the fixed program ( G - 13 ) . Electroporated cells were transferred to dishes and incubated fo r 1 h at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 to remove non - neu - ronal cells . Medium containing non - adherent cells was col - lected , centrifuged , and suspended in Ham’s F - 12 medium con - taining 10 % fetal bovine serum , N2 supplement and 20 ng / ml NGF ( Wako , Osaka , Japan ) , and then plated in poly - L - lysine - coated dishes . After 48 h of incubation , the neurons were resus - pended in Ham’s F - 12 medium containing 4 % bovine serum albumin , N2 supplement , and 20 ng / ml NGF , replated in poly - L - lysine - and laminin - coated glass - bottom culture dishes , and further incubated for 12 h before time - lapse observation . CHO - K1 cells were maintained in minimum essential medi - um - (cid:2) supplemented with 9 % fetal bovine serum and trans - fected using Lipofectamine - 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Generation of PC12 Cell Lines —Retrovirus stocks encoding human SSH1 or mouse SSH2 were obtained by transfection of pLNCX plasmids ( Clontech ) encoding human SSH1 or mouse SSH2 cDNAs with packaging vectors ( retrovirus packaging kit Ampho , Takara Bio , Otsu , Japan ) into 293T cells and by har - vesting conditioned growth medium containing secreted retro - virus . Virus stocks were filtered through a 0 . 45 - (cid:1) m filter , sup - plemented with 8 (cid:1) g / ml polybrene , and incubated with PC12 cells for 48 h . PC12 cells expressing retrovirus - encoding cDNAs were selected for growth in medium containing 800 (cid:1) g / ml G418 . Recombinant Herpes Simplex Virus Preparation and In - fection —The recombinant herpes simplex virus stocks were prepared as described previously ( 13 ) . For infection , freshly dis - sociated DRG explants were allowed to adhere to dishes for 30 min and then incubated with recombinant viral stocks for 12 h before analysis . Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analyses —Immuno - precipitation and immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously ( 28 ) . In Vitro Kinase Assay —Serum - starved PC12 cells were stim - ulated with 100 ng / ml NGF and lysed in kinase buffer ( 50 m M Hepes ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 m M NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P - 40 , 5 % glycerol , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M MnCl 2 , 10 m M NaF , 1 m M Na 3 VO 4 , 1 m M dithiothreitol , 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 10 (cid:1) g / ml leupeptin ) . LIMK1 or LIMK2 was immunoprecipitated with anti - LIMK1 or anti - LIMK2 antibodies and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using His 6 - tagged cofilin as a substrate , as described ( 13 ) . Reaction mixtures were separated on SDS - PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography , Amido Black stain - ing , and immunoblotting with anti - LIMK1 and anti - LIMK2 antibodies . Neurite Outgrowth Assay —PC12 cells were cotransfected with pSUPER and YFP plasmids ( 4 : 1 ) by electroporation , cul - tured for 32 h and further serum - starved for 16 h . Then , neurite outgrowth was stimulated with 50 ng / ml NGF and allowed to proceed for 48 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium con - taining 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin . The cells with neurites lon - ger than two cell body lengths of YFP - positive cells were scored as the neurite - bearing cells . The mean lengths of the longest neurites were measured for YFP - positive cells with neurites longer than one cell body length .

Time - lapse fluorescence images were captured every 30 s for 15 min with 50 – 100 - ms exposures , using a Coolsnap HQ - cooled CCD camera ( Roper Scientific ) driven by Q550FW Imaging Software ( Leica ) . For quantification of areas of protru - sion , a series of images was digi - tized . Growth cones were outlined at 30 - s intervals , and the outlines were used to calculate areas of new protrusion of the growth cone perimeter by binary segmentation using IPLab image analysis soft - ware ( Scanalytics , Fairfax , VA ) . The index of growth cone motility was calculated by dividing the average area of new protrusions of each growth cone measured at 30 - s intervals over a total record - ing time of 3 min by the average growth cone perimeter during 3 min of recording . The rate of neu - rite extension was defined as the mean distance that the center of the growth cone migrated during 10 min of recording . Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t test . Immunofluorescence and Quanti - fication of Actin Assembly —DRG explants were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde containing 10 % sucrose for 20 min followed by (cid:5) 20 °C methanol for 5 min . The explants were blocked with 2 % fetal bovine serum in phosphate - buff - ered saline for 1 h and then incu - bated with rabbit polyclonal anti - P - cofilin antibodies that recognize both P - cofilin and P - ADF ( 8 ) and a monoclonal anti - (cid:3) - actin antibody ( AC - 15 , Sigma ) overnight at 4 °C , washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline , and incubated with fluorescein - and rhodamine - conju - gated secondary antibodies fo r 1 h at room temperature . To quantify the actin assembly at the leading edge of the growth cone , DRG neurons were stained with anti - (cid:3) - actin anti - body , and noncollapsed growth cones were randomly selected and fluorescence images were acquired using a Coolsnap HQ - cooled CCD camera driven by Q550FW Imaging Software . Growth cones were outlined on the fluorescence image by automatic outline tool and the average fluores - cence intensity ( mean pixel density ) in a region of 5 (cid:1) m width inside the front edge of the growth cone was measured using NIH image ( Version 1 . 63 ) . The fluorescence intensi - ties were collected from 20 – 25 different growth cones per each sample group . Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test . FIGURE2 .

Roles of LIM Kinase and Slingshot in Neurite Extension MAY 4 , 2007• VOLUME 282•NUMBER 18 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 13695 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 18 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m RESULTS Both SSH1 and SSH2 Are Involved in NGF - induced Cofi - lin / ADF Dephosphorylation in PC12 Cells —To investigate the effect of cofilin / ADF phosphoregulation on NGF - in - duced neurite extension , we first analyzed changes in P - co - filin / P - ADF levels in PC12 cells after NGF stimulation . Immunoblot analysis with an anti - P - cofilin antibody , which recognizes both P - cofilin and P - ADF ( 8 ) , revealed that NGF induced cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation in PC12 cells ( Fig . 1 A ) , as previously reported ( 16 ) . To examine whether SSHs are responsible for the NGF - induced cofilin / ADF dephos - phorylation , we suppressed SSH1 and SSH2 expression with siRNAs , using a pSUPER . retro . puro vector containing the puromycin - resistance gene to allow selection of siRNA - transfected cells . Transfection of siRNA plasmids targeting rat SSH1 and SSH2 substantially reduced the expression of endogenous SSH1 and SSH2 , respectively , in PC12 cells ( Fig . 1 B ) . Knockdown of SSH1 or SSH2 alone produced no appar - ent effect on NGF - induced cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation ( Fig . 1 C ) . In contrast , knockdown of both SSH1 and SSH2 at the same time notably inhibited NGF - induced dephospho - rylation of cofilin / ADF ( Fig . 1 C ) , indicating that SSH1 and SSH2 function redundantly for NGF - in - duced cofilin / ADF dephosphoryla - tion . In PC12 cell lines stably expressing human SSH1 - Myc or mouse SSH2 - Myc , whose expres - sion was not affected by the siRNA plasmids targeting rat SSH1 or SSH2 , double knockdown of rat SSH1 / SSH2 had no apparent effect on NGF - induced cofilin / ADF de - phosphorylation ( Fig . 1 D ) . Thus , the siRNA - resistant human SSH1 and mouse SSH2 restored NGF - in - duced cofilin / ADF dephosphoryla - tion . NGF - induced cofilin / ADF de - phosphorylation was blocked by K252a ( an inhibitor of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors ) , U73122 ( an inhibitor of phospholipase C ) , and latrunculin A ( an inhibitor of actin filament assembly ) ( Fig . 1 E ) , which indicates that NGF - induced cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation requires Trk , phospholipase C , and F - actin . Cofilin and ADF Are Essential for NGF - induced Neurite Extension from PC12 Cells —Cofilin and ADF are closely related proteins and PC12 cells express both ( 16 ) . To examine whether cofilin and ADF affect NGF - induced neurite out - growth from PC12 cells , we sup - pressed the expression of endoge - nous cofilin and ADF in PC12 cells by transfecting cofilin and ADF siRNA plasmids ( Fig . 2 A ) . The PC12 cells were cotransfected with YFP plasmids to permit the transfected cells to be visual - ized . The transfected cells were cultured for 32 h , serum - starved for 16 h , and then stimulated with NGF for 48 h ( Fig . 2 B ) . Transfection of cofilin / ADF siRNAs had no apparent effect on the viablity of PC12 cells ( supplemental Fig . S1 ) . To quanti - tate the effects of cofilin / ADF siRNA on neurite extension , we scored the percentage of neurite - bearing cells with neurites longer than two cell body lengths in YFP - positive cells ( Fig . 2 C ) . We also compared the mean lengths of the longest neurites of YFP - positive cells with neurites longer than one cell body ( Fig . 2 D ) . Individual knockdown of cofilin or ADF significantly reduced both the number of neurite - bearing cells and the mean neurite length , compared with cells treated with a control siRNA . ADF knockdown suppressed neurite outgrowth more prominently than cofilin knockdown . When both cofilin and ADF were knocked down simultaneously , the percentage of neurite - bearing cells drastically decreased ( Fig . 2 B , 2 C ) . Cotransfection of chick cofilin or ADF , whose expression was not affected by rat cofilin or ADF siRNA , significantly blocked the inhibitory effects of cofilin / ADF knockdown on FIGURE 3 .

These results suggest that cofilin / ADF are essential for NGF - induced neurite outgrowth from PC12 cells . SSH1 and SSH2 Are Critical for NGF - induced Neurite Exten - sion from PC12 Cells —We next examined whether SSH1 and SSH2 are involved in NGF - induced neurite extension from PC12 cells by knocking down SSH1 and SSH2 with siRNAs ( Fig . 3 A , see also Fig . 1 B ) . The percentage of neurite - bearing cells was significantly reduced by SSH1 or SSH2 single knockdown or SSH1 / SSH2 double knockdown , compared with control siRNA ( Fig . 3 B ) . The mean neurite length was also reduced in single and double SSH knockdown cells ( Fig . 3 C ) . In PC12 cells stably expressing human SSH1 or mouse SSH2 , the number of neurite - bearing cells ( Fig . 3 D ) and the mean neurite length ( not shown ) were not affected by either single or double knockdown of endogenous rat SSH1 / SSH2 , which indicates that the effects of SSH1 / SSH2 siRNA on neurite extension are attributable to the suppression of SSH1 / SSH2 expression and both SSH1 and SSH2 act to promote NGF - in - duced neurite extension from PC12 cells . NGF Induces LIMK1 / LIMK2 Ac - tivation in PC12 Cells —NGF in - duces cofilin / ADF dephosphoryla - tion , raising the possibility that the kinase activity of LIMKs may be negatively regulated by NGF stimu - lation . However , when we examined the changes in the kinase activities of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in PC12 cells after NGF stimulation , both LIMK1 and LIMK2 were activated rather than repressed . LIMK1 activity increased 1 . 7 - fold at 2 min after NGF treatment and then reverted to the basal level by 30 min ( Fig . 4 A ) . In contrast , LIMK2 activity gradually increased , reaching 1 . 5 - fold by 30 min after NGF treatment ( Fig . 4 B ) . Pretreatment of PC12 cells with wortmannin , an inhibitor of phos - phoinositide 3 - kinase , blocked the NGF - induced activation of LIMK1 but not of LIMK2 ( Fig . 4 C , 4 D ) . In contrast , Y - 27632 , a specific inhibi - tor of ROCK , had no apparent effect on NGF - induced LIMK1 or LIMK2 activation ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . LIMK1 and LIMK2 Are Critical for NGF - induced Neurite Extension from PC12 Cells —To examine whether LIMK1 and LIMK2 con - tribute to NGF - induced neurite extension from PC12 cells , we intro - duced siRNA plasmids targeting rat LIMK1 and LIMK2 into the cells , which suppressed the expression of endogenous LIMK1 and LIMK2 , respectively ( Fig . 5 A ) . The kinase activity of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in cells expressing the corresponding siRNA also decreased , according to the decrease in their expression levels ( supplemental Fig . S2 ) . Knockdown of LIMK1 , LIMK2 , or both significantly reduced the number of neurite - bearing cells and the mean neurite length , compared with control cells ( Fig . 5 , B - D ) . LIMK2 knockdown suppressed neurite extension more prominently than LIMK1 knockdown . Similar results were obtained by using another set of siRNAs for rat LIMK1 and LIMK2 ( supplemental Fig . S3 ) . These results suggest that both LIMK1 and LIMK2 are critical for NGF - induced neurite exten - sion of PC12 cells . We also analyzed the P - cofilin / P - ADF levels in unstimulated PC12 cells expressing LIMK1 / LIMK2 siRNAs . The P - cofilin / P - ADF levels reduced in cells expressing LIMK2 or LIMK1 / LIMK2 double knockdown cells but not LIMK1 knockdown cells ( supplemental Fig . S4 ) , which suggests that FIGURE 4 . NGF induces LIMK1 and LIMK2 activation in PC12 cells . A and B , PC12 cells were stimulated with 100 ng / ml NGF . At the indicated times , the cells were lysed and endogenous LIMK1 ( A ) or LIMK2 ( B ) was immunoprecipitated and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay , using His 6 - cofilin as a substrate . Reaction mix - tures were separated on SDS - PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography ( 32 P ) , Amido Black staining , and immu - noblotting with anti - LIMK1 and anti - LIMK2 antibodies . The relative kinase activities of LIMK1 ( A ) or LIMK2 ( B ) after NGF stimulation are shown as means (cid:3) S . D . of three independent experiments . C , NGF - induced LIMK1 activation is inhibited by wortmannin ( Wort ) but not Y - 27632 . PC12 cells were pretreated with 100 n M wort - mannin or 10 (cid:1) M Y - 27632 for 30 min , or left untreated , then stimulated with NGF for 2 min . LIMK1 was immu - noprecipitated and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay . D , wortmannin and Y - 27632 have no apparent effect on NGF - induced LIMK2 activation . PC12 cells were pretreated with wortmannin or Y - 27632 as in C , then stim - ulated with NGF for 10 min . LIMK2 was immunoprecipitated and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay . In C and D , experiments were repeated twice , and similar results were obtained .

LIMK1 and LIMK2 Are Critical for the Growth Cone Exten - sion and Motility of Chick DRG Neurons —To assess the roles of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in the growth cone extension and motility of neurons in primary culture , we used time - lapse fluorescence microscopy to analyze the effects of LIMK1 and LIMK2 knock - down on the growth cone movement of chick DRG neurons . When cotransfected into CHO cells , the siRNA plasmids tar - geting chLIMK1 and chLIMK2 strongly silenced the expression of Myc - chLIMK1 and Myc - chLIMK2 , respectively ( Fig . 6 A ) . To analyze the growth cone motility , chick DRG neurons were cotransfected with YFP plasmids and siRNA plasmids for chLIMK1 or chLIMK2 using Nucleofector II , cultured them for 48 h , replated the neurons in laminin - coated dishes , and further cultured them for 12 h before time - lapse observation . NGF was always included in the culture medium . Representative live images of growth cones are shown in Fig . 6 B . Time - lapse obser - vations revealed that single knockdown of LIMK1 or LIMK2 , or double knockdown of LIMK1 / LIMK2 , markedly decreased the rate of growth cone extension , compared with the rate in DRG neurons transfected with a control siRNA ( Fig . 6 B ) . To quanti - tate the data , we measured the distance that the center of the growth cone migrated during 10 min of recording . The average rate of neurite extension of the neurons expressing LIMK1 , LIMK2 , and LIMK1 / LIMK2 siRNA were 13 . 8 (cid:3) 1 . 6 (cid:1) m / 10 min , 16 . 1 (cid:3) 1 . 6 (cid:1) m / 10 min , and 10 . 2 (cid:3) 1 . 4 (cid:1) m / 10 min , respectively , corresponding to 50 % , 59 % , and 37 % of the rate of the con - trol siRNA neurons ( 27 . 4 (cid:3) 1 . 5 (cid:1) m / 10 min ) ( Fig . 6 C ) . Similar results were obtained by using another set of siRNAs for chick LIMK1 and LIMK2 ( supplemental Fig . S5 ) . We also quantified the motility of the growth cones . The motility index of the growth cone was calculated by dividing the area of new protrusions at 30 - s intervals by the average growth cone perime - ter . The average value was calcu - lated from recording of each growth cone ( 26 – 28 different growth cones ) over a total of 3 min . The motility indices of growth cones of LIMK1 , LIMK2 , and LIMK1 / LIMK2 siRNA neurons were 0 . 24 (cid:3) 0 . 02 (cid:1) m / 30 s , 0 . 26 (cid:3) 0 . 02 (cid:1) m / 30 s , and 0 . 23 (cid:3) 0 . 02 (cid:1) m / 30 s , respec - tively , corresponding to 59 % , 65 % , and 56 % of the index of control siRNA neurons ( 0 . 40 (cid:3) 0 . 02 (cid:1) m / 30 s ) ( Fig . 6 D ) . These results suggest that both LIMK1 and LIMK2 are critical for neurite extension and growth cone motility of chick DRG neurons . Immunostaining with anti - P - cofilin antibody revealed that the P - cofilin level in DRG neurons expressing chLIMK1 / chLIMK2 siRNAs was sig - nificantly low , compared with the surrounding siRNA - non - ex - pressing neurons or control siRNA - expressing neurons ( sup - plemental Fig . S6 ) , which indicates that LIMK1 / LIMK2 are involved in growth cone extension and motility through cofilin / ADF phosphorylation . S3 Peptide Suppresses the Growth Cone Extension and Motil - ity of Chick DRG Neurons —To further examine the role of LIMKs in growth cone extension and motility , we used a cell - permeable peptide inhibitor of LIMKs ( S3 peptide ) , which con - tains the N - terminal 16 - amino acid sequence of cofilin and the cell - permeable sequence motif of penetratin ( 18 , 25 ) . As a con - trol , the reverse ( RV ) peptide containing the reverse sequence of cofilin and the penetratin sequence was also tested . Chick DRG explants were cultured overnight , and then the movement of the growth cones was monitored by time - lapse microscopy after treatment with the S3 or RV peptide for 1 h . Treatment with S3 peptide , but not RV peptide , reduced the neurite exten - sion rate and the growth cone motility ( Fig . 7 A ) . To quantify the rate of neurite extension and the motility of growth cones , DRG neurons were infected with herpes simplex virus coding for YFP FIGURE 5 .

S3 peptide , but not RV peptide , markedly reduced the rate of neurite exten - sion ( S3 , 6 . 7 (cid:3) 1 . 9 (cid:1) m / 10 min ; RV , 19 . 8 (cid:3) 1 . 7 (cid:1) m / 10 min ) ( Fig . 7 B ) and the motility of growth cones ( S3 , 0 . 3 (cid:3) 0 . 02 (cid:1) m / 30 s ; RV , 0 . 44 (cid:3) 0 . 02 (cid:1) m / 30 s ) ( Fig . 7 C ) , compared with non - treated growth cones ( 18 . 2 (cid:3) 1 . 9 (cid:1) m / 10 min and 0 . 43 (cid:3) 0 . 02 (cid:1) m / 30 s ) . Thus , S3 peptide produced a phenotype similar to that of neurons transfected with LIMK1 / LIMK2 siRNA , supporting the importance of LIMK1 / LIMK2 - catalyzed cofilin phosphorylation for neurite extension from and growth cone motility of chick DRG neurons . Effects of S3 Peptide on P - cofilin Levels and Actin Filament Assembly in Growth Cones of Chick DRG Neurons —We examined the effects of S3 peptide treatment on the P - co - filin levels and actin filament assem - bly in growth cones of chick DRG neurons . Chick DRG explants that had been cultured overnight were treated for 1 h with S3 or RV peptide and then fixed and stained with anti - P - cofilin and anti - (cid:3) - actin anti - bodies . The anti - P - cofilin antibody recognized P - cofilin even in the presence of S3 or RV peptide , indi - cating that S3 or RV peptide does not interfere with the ability of anti - P - cofilin antibody ( supple - mental Fig . S7 ) . Treatment with S3 peptide significantly reduced the P - cofilin levels in DRG neurons , compared with those of untreated or RV peptide - treated neurons ( Fig . 8 A , top panels ) . Intensive F - actin assembly was observed in the leading edge of the growth cones in untreated and RV pep - tide - treated neurons , whereas the S3 peptide - treated neurons exhib - ited weaker F - actin staining in the periphery of the growth cones ( Fig . 8 A , bottom panels ) . Quanti - tative analysis of the intensity of anti - (cid:3) - actin immunofluorescence revealed that actin assembly in the peripheral region of the growth cone was significantly reduced by treatment with S3 peptide ( Fig . 8 B ) . These observations suggest that S3 peptide treatment suppressed cofilin phosphorylation and actin filament assembly at the tip of the growth cone . FIGURE 6 .

Roles of LIM Kinase and Slingshot in Neurite Extension MAY 4 , 2007• VOLUME 282•NUMBER 18 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 13699 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 18 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m DISCUSSION In this study , we examined the roles of cofilin / ADF and their upstream regulators , LIMK1 / LIMK2 and SSH1 / SSH2 , in NGF - induced neurite extension from PC12 cells or chick DRG neurons . Consistent with a previous report ( 16 ) , NGF induced cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation in PC12 cells . This dephosphorylation was repressed by double knockdown of both SSH1 and SSH2 but not by single knockdowns of either SSH1 or SSH2 , and expression of siRNA - resistant human SSH1 or mouse SSH2 restored NGF - induced cofilin / ADF dephos - phorylation in SSH1 / SSH2 double - knockdown cells . These results suggest that both SSH1 and SSH2 are responsible for NGF - in - duced cofilin / ADF dephosphoryla - tion and that they function redun - dantly in this process . Knockdown of SSH1 / SSH2 also significantly suppressed NGF - induced neurite extension from PC12 cells , which suggests that SSH1 / SSH2 acts through cofilin / ADF dephosphoryl - ation to promote neurite extension . However , double knockdown of SSH1 / SSH2 only partially sup - pressed NGF - induced neurite extension , whereas double knock - down of cofilin / ADF almost com - pletely inhibited it . These results suggest that other cofilin / ADF phosphatases , such as SSH3 or chronophin , may be involved in the maintenance of basal cofilin / ADF activity ( 9 – 11 ) . K252a blocked NGF - induced dephosphorylation of cofilin / ADF , which indicates that NGF induces cofilin / ADF dephos - phorylation via the high - affinity NGF receptor TrkA . U73122 , an inhibitor of phospholipase C , also blocked NGF - induced cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation . Phospholipase C acts upstream of calcium signal - ing , and SSH1 activation and cofi - lin / ADF dephosphorylation are induced by calcium and calcineurin signals in other types of cells ( 16 , 29 ) , making it possible that phos - pholipase C mediates NGF - induced SSH activation and cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation by stimulating a calcium / calcineurin signaling path - way . SSH1 is highly activated by association with F - actin ( 30 ) ; con - sistent with this , latrunculin - A , which inhibits actin filament assem - bly , also suppressed NGF - induced cofilin / ADF dephosphorylation . We showed in this study that both LIMK1 and LIMK2 are activated after NGF stimulation in PC12 cells , although the time courses of their activation differ ; LIMK1 is activated transiently , while LIMK2 activity increases gradually up to 30 min . LIMK1 activation was inhibited by wortmannin , but not by Y - 27632 , while LIMK2 activation was not affected by either wortmannin or Y - 27632 . These results suggest that LIMK1 , but not LIMK2 , is activated downstream of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase and that the Rho - ROCK signaling pathway is not involved in NGF - induced LIMK1 / LIMK2 acti - vation . Thus , the signaling mechanisms that lead to NGF - in - duced LIMK1 and LIMK2 activation significantly differ , and FIGURE7 . S3peptidesuppressesgrowthconeextensionandmotilityofchickDRGneurons .

Roles of LIM Kinase and Slingshot in Neurite Extension 13700 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 282•NUMBER 18• MAY 4 , 2007 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 18 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m LIMK1 and LIMK2 seem to play distinct roles in NGF - induced neurite extension . Interestingly , knockdown of LIMK1 , LIMK2 , or both significantly suppressed NGF - induced neurite exten - sion from PC12 cells and chick DRG neurons . Similarly , the cell - permeable S3 peptide , which inhibits LIMK1 / LIMK2 activity , reduced the P - cofilin / P - ADF levels in the growth cone and suppressed growth cone motility and extension in chick DRG neurons . Consistent with these observations , previous studies showed that expression of dominant - negative LIMK1 or suppression of LIMK1 expression inhibited axonal out - growth from hippocampal pyramidal neurons ( 14 , 22 ) . Further - more , overexpression of the LIM domain of LIMK1 , which may function as a dominant - negative form to suppress endogenous LIMK1 , inhibited NGF - or Ras - induced neurite extension from PC12 cells ( 31 , 32 ) . Together these observations suggest that LIMK1 and LIMK2 stimulates neurite extension through their cofilin - phosphorylating activity . In contrast , overexpression of LIMK1 in chick DRG neurons suppressed neurite extension ( 13 ) , which was probably due to the profound loss of cofilin / ADF activity caused by the overexpression . Thus , a proper bal - ance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is required to regulate cofilin / ADF activity for growth cone extension and motility . A previous study also showed that SSH1 forms a com - plex with LIMK1 and directly inhibits the kinase activity of LIMK1 by dephosphorylation ( 33 ) , which may suggest that LIMK1 activity is spatially and temporally regulated in the growth cone by association with SSH1 . How do LIMK1 and LIMK2 contribute to the motility and extension of growth cones ? We previously showed that LIMK1 is required for chemokine - induced T cell migration and che - motaxis ( 25 , 34 ) . Because the knockdown of LIMK1 suppresses stimulus - induced actin filament assembly and lamellipodium formation ( 34 ) , LIMK1 appears to be required for the actin filament assembly necessary to produce lamellipodial protru - sion in the periphery of the migrating cell . Consistent with these studies , we showed here that S3 peptide treatment signif - icantly reduced actin filament assembly in the peripheral region of the growth cone of chick DRG neurons . Thus , one possible model is that LIMKs play a role in the establishment of lamel - lipodia by locally inactivating cofilin and inducing actin fila - ment assembly at the leading edge of growth cones . On the other hand , as LIMKs have the potential to enhance the forma - tion of the focal adhesion complexes that are required for cells to advance protrusions ( 35 ) , they may be involved in neurite extension by stimulating the formation of focal complexes . Another possibility is that LIMKs accelerate the phosphocycle of cofilin by cooperating with SSHs . In this model , LIMKs stim - ulate dissociation of the actin - cofilin complex by phosphoryl - ating cofilin to produce free actin and P - cofilin , and SSHs there - after reactivate the released P - cofilin by dephosphorylation , thus accelerating actin and cofilin turnover ( 36 ) . Based on the distinct time courses of activation of LIMK1 and LIMK2 , it is possible that LIMK1 acts in the formation of lamellipodia in the initial phase after NGF stimulation and LIMK2 stimulates the phosphocycle of cofilin . However , further studies are required to understand the distinct roles of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in growth cone motility and extension . We have provided evidence that both LIMK1 / LIMK2 and SSH1 / SSH2 are required for NGF - induced neurite extension . LIMKs are therefore activated by factors that stimulate neurite extension , such as NGF ( shown in this study ) , as well as neurite retraction , such as semaphorin - 3A and Nogo ( 18 , 19 ) , and are essential for both attractive and repulsive guidance signaling . It is probable that the local and temporal regulation of LIMKs and SSHs and the balance of their activities are important for driv - ing the attractive or repulsive response of growth cones . Fur - ther studies on the mechanisms of local and temporal regula - tion of LIMK and SSH activities within growth cones in response to various external cues will help to elucidate the mechanism of growth cone guidance .
