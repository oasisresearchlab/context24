However , little is known about how activated Rac1 / Cdc42 regulates dendritic spines . Insulin receptor substrate 53 ( IRSp53 ) , which is highly expressed in the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) , is known to link activated Rac1 / Cdc42 to downstream effectors for actin regulation in non - neural cells . Here , we report that IRSp53 interacts with two specific members of the PSD - 95 family , PSD - 95 and chapsyn - 110 / PSD - 93 , in brain . An IRSp53 mutant lacking the C - terminal PSD - 95 - binding motif shows significant loss of synaptic localization in cultured neurons . Over - expression of IRSp53 in cultured neurons increases the density of dendritic spines but does not affect their length or width . Conversely , short - interferingRNA - mediatedknock - downofIRSp53reducesthedensity , length , andwidthofspines . Inaddition , thedensityandsize of spines are decreased by a dominant - negative IRSp53 with a point mutation in the Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain and a dominant - negativeproline - richregionofWAVE2 ( Wiskott - AldrichsyndromeproteinfamilyVerprolin - homologousprotein ) , adownstreameffec - tor of IRSp53 that binds to the SH3 domain of IRSp53 . These results suggest that PSD - 95 interaction is an important determinant of synapticIRSp53localizationandthattheSH3domainofIRSp53linksactivatedRac1 / Cdc42todownstreameffectorsfortheregulationof spine morphogenesis . Key words : PSD - 95 ; IRSp53 ; PDZ ; Rac1 ; Cdc42 ; spine Introduction Dendritic spines are postsynaptic actin - rich protrusions impli - cated in the regulation of the structure , function , and plasticity of glutamatergic synapses ( Harris and Kater , 1994 ; Matus , 2000 ; Hering and Sheng , 2001 ; Yuste and Bonhoeffer , 2001 , 2004 ; Nim - chinsky et al . , 2002 ) . Synaptic molecules that have received atten - tion for their roles in regulating spine morphogenesis include the Rac1 and Cdc42 Rho family of small GTPases ( Luo et al . , 1996 ; Nakayama et al . , 2000 ; Tashiro et al . , 2000 ; Irie and Yamaguchi , 2002 ; Scott et al . , 2003 ) and their upstream activators , including the Kalirin - 7 and p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) interacting ex - change factor ( (cid:1) PIX ) guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( Pen - zes et al . , 2000 , 2001 , 2003 ; Parnas et al . , 2001 ; Park et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . However , the molecular mechanisms linking activated Rac1 / Cdc42 to downstream effectors for spine regula - tion are not well understood . Insulin receptor substrate 53 ( IRSp53 ) is an effector protein that couples activated Rac1 / Cdc42 to actin regulation ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) . IRSp53 con - tains various domains for protein – protein interaction , including an N - terminal Rac binding ( RCB ) domain , a partial Cdc42 and Rac1 - interactive binding ( CRIB ) motif , an Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain , and a C - terminal PDZ [ postsynaptic density - 95 ( PSD - 95 ) / Discs large / zona occludens - 1 ( ZO - 1 ) ] - binding motif . The RCB domain of IRSp53 binds activated Rac1 , stimulating forma - tion of lamellipodia and ruffles by mechanisms requiring the interaction of its SH3 domain with WAVE2 ( Wiskott - Aldrich syndrom protein family Verprolin - homologous protein ) , a member of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) fam - ily of actin - regulatory proteins ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Miki and Tak - enawa , 2002 ) . The partial CRIB motif of IRSp53 binds activated Cdc42 and induces the formation of filopodia through the inter - action of its SH3 domain with Mena , a member of the Ena / vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein family of actin - regulatory proteins ( Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ) . The SH3 domain of IRSp53 also associates with various poly - proline - containing proteins , including the abundant PSD pro - teinShank / Proline - richsynapse - associatedprotein ( SAP ) ( Bock - mann et al . , 2002 ; Soltau et al . , 2002 ) , the actin - bundling protein espin ( Sekerkova et al . , 2003 ) , and mDia1 , a regulator of stress fiber formation and cytokinesis ( Fujiwara et al . , 2000 ) . The C - terminal PDZ - binding motif binds to the PDZ domain protein MALS ( mammalian LIN - seven ) ( Hori et al . , 2003 ) .

These results suggest that IRSp53 is an impor - tant Rac1 / Cdc42 - dependent regulator of the actin cytoskeleton . Inneurons , IRSp53wasinitiallyidentifiedasacomponentofthe PSD ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ) , but little is known about its neuronal functions . Important steps toward understanding the neuronal functions of IRSp53 would be to determine the molecular mecha - nism by which IRSp53 is localized to the PSD and whether and how IRSp53 regulates the morphogenesis of dendritic spines . Here , we reportthattheinteractionofIRSp53withPSD - 95 , anabundantPSD protein , is important for synaptic IRSp53 localization and that IRSp53 , through its SH3 domain , regulates spine morphogenesis . Materials and Methods Yeast two - hybrid screen and assay . The PDZ2 domain of PSD - 95 ( aa 89 – 299 ) in the pBHA bait vector was used to screen a human brain yeast two - hybrid cDNA contained in the pACT2 prey vector ( Clontech , Palo Alto , CA ) .

Other PDZ domains in pGAD10 have been described previously ( Choi et al . , 2002 ; Mok et al . , 2002 ) . GST pull - down assay . For glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusion pro - teins , aa 470 – 521 and 470 – 517 of IRSp53 and aa 786 – 899 of Shank1 were subcloned into the Bam HI - Eco RI site of pGEX4T - 1 ( Amersham Biosciences , Arlington , IL ) . The precipitates were analyzed by immuno - blotting with antibodies against Myc ( 1 (cid:2) g / ml ; for PSD - 95 and chapsyn - 110 ) , enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) [ 1 (cid:2) g / ml ; SAP97 and S - SCAM ( synaptic scaffolding molecule ) ] , FLAG ( 1 (cid:2) g / ml ; SAP102 ) , and IRSp53 ( 1 (cid:2) g / ml ) antibodies . Antibodies . H6 - IRSp53 ( human full length ) was used as an immuno - gen to generate rabbit ( 1452 ) and guinea pig ( 1454 ) polyclonal antibod - ies . Guinea pig polyclonal PSD - 95 ( 1402 ) and rabbit polyclonal SAP102 ( 1445 ) antibodiesweregeneratedusingGST - PSD - 95 ( ratfulllength ) and GST - SAP102 ( mouse full length ) as immunogens , respectively . Specific antibodies were affinity purified using polyvinylidene difluoride mem - branes ( Amersham Biosciences ) or SulfoLink columns ( Pierce , Rock - ford , IL ) , and the specificity of each antibody for the corresponding PSD - 95 family protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis ( data not shown ) . The following antibodies have been described previously : PSD - 95 ( HM319 ) ( Kim et al . , 1995 ) , PSD - 95 ( SM55 ) ( Choi et al . , 2002 ) , SAP97 ( B9591 ) ( Kim et al . , 1996 ) , chapsyn - 110 ( B9594 ) ( Kim et al . , 1996 ) , S - SCAM ( 1146 ) ( Mok et al . , 2002 ) , EGFP ( 1167 ) ( Choi et al . , 2002 ) , NMDA receptor subunit 2B ( NR2B ) ( Sheng et al . , 1994 ) , Shank ( 3856 ) ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) , and Shank ( 1123 ) ( Lim et al . , 2001 ) . The following antibodies were purchased : synaptophysin , FLAG , (cid:1) - tubulin , and vinculin hVIN - 1 ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) ; HA mouse monoclonal ( Boehringer Mannheim , Philadelphia , PA ) ; and HA and Myc rabbit polyclonal ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) . Expression and short - interfering RNA constructs . Human IRSp53 cDNAs ( NM _ 017450 ; full length aa 1 – 521 and aa 1 – 517 , which lacks the last four residues ) were subcloned into the Bam HI - Eco RI site of pcDNA3 . 1 - HA ( the HA epitope was inserted into the Hind III - Kpn I site ofpcDNA3 . 1 , whichislocatedNterminaltothesiteofIRSp53insertion ) for coimmunoprecipitation in heterologous cells and targeting experi - ments in neurons ) and the Bgl II - Eco RI site of pIRES2 - EGFP ( for spine - promoting experiments in neurons ; Clontech ) . Full - length rat IRSp53 ( AY037934 ) was subcloned into the Bam HI - Eco RI site of pcDNA3 . 1 - HA [ for the analysis of short - interfering RNA ( siRNA ) constructs ] . Mouse SAP102 ( fulllength ; aa1 – 835 ) wassubclonedintothe Hind III - Eco RIsite of the pFLAG - CMV2 vector ( Sigma ) . Full - length SAP97 ( rat ; aa 1 – 912 ) and S - SCAM ( rat ; aa 1 – 1278 ) were subcloned into the Eco RI - Kpn I site of pEGFP - N1 ( Clontech ) . For siRNA downregulation , pSUPER IRSp53 was generated by annealing oligonucleotides containing nt 522 – 540 ( with the first nucleotide of the start codon as nucleotide 1 ) of the rat IRSp53 cDNA ( GenBank accession number AY037934 ; critical 19 nucle - otide sequence GCTGGAGAACTACGTGTCT ) and subcloning into the Bgl II - Hind III site of pSUPER ( OligoEngine Platform , Seattle , WA ) . For FLAG - WAVE2 Pro , aa 273 – 402 of WAVE2 was subcloned into the Hind III - Kpn I site of p3XFLAG - CMV7 . 1 ( Sigma ) . IRSp53 constructs with a point mutation in the SH3 domain ( I403P ) were generated using theQuickChangekit ( Stratagene , LaJolla , CA ) . Thefollowingexpression constructshavebeendescribedpreviously : GW1 - PSD - 95 - EGFP ( Arnold andClapham , 1999 ) , GW1 - Myc - PSD - 95 ( Hsuehetal . , 1997 ) , andGW1 - Myc - chapsyn - 110 ( Hsueh et al . , 1997 ) . Preparation and immunoblot analysis of PSD and subcellular fractions . Subcellular fractionation of rat brain was performed as described previ - ously ( Huttner et al . , 1983 ) . PSD fractions were purified as described previously ( Cho et al . , 1992 ) . Immunoblot analysis of these fractions was performed using IRSp53 ( 1452 ; 1 (cid:2) g / ml ) , PSD - 95 ( SM55 ; 1 : 500 ) , and synaptophysin ( 1 : 1000 ) antibodies . Coimmunoprecipitation assay . For coimmunoprecipitation with brain samples , the crude synaptosomal fraction of adult rat brain was solubi - lized with deoxycholic acid ( DOC ) buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , pH 9 . 0 ) , dialyzed against binding / dialysis buffer ( 50 m M Tris - HCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , pH 7 . 4 ) , and centrifuged . The supernatant was incubated with PSD - 95 ( 1402 ; 1 (cid:2) g / ml ) , IRSp53 ( 1452 ; 2 (cid:2) g / ml ) , or rabbit / guinea pig IgG ( 2 (cid:2) g / ml ; negative control ) for 2 h and then with protein A - Sepharose ( Amersham Biosciences ) for 2 h . The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against IRSp53 ( 1452 and1454 ; 1 (cid:2) g / ml ) , NR2B ( 1 : 1000 ) , vinculin ( 1 : 1000 ) , PSD - 95 ( HM319 ; 1 : 1000 ) , chapsyn - 110 ( B9594 ; 1 : 1000 ) , SAP97 ( B9591 ; 1 : 1000 ) , SAP102 ( 1445 ; 1 : 1000 ) , S - SCAM ( 1146 ; 1 : 1000 ) , and Shank ( 3856 ; 1 : 1000 ) . Immunofluorescence histochemistry on rat brain sections . Rat brain sec - tions ( 50 (cid:2) m ) were permeabilized by incubation in PBS containing 50 % ethanolatroomtemperaturefor30min . Forimmunofluorescencestain - ing , brain sections were doubly incubated with IRSp53 ( 1 : 500 ) and syn - aptophysin ( 1 : 1000 ) antibodies or NeuroTrace fluorescent Nissl stain ( 1 : 1000 ; Molecular Probes ) overnight at room temperature , followed by FITC - and CY3 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Jackson Immuno - Research , West Grove , PA ) for 2 h at room temperature . Images were capturedusingaLeica ( Nussloch , Germany ) SP2confocallaser - scanning microscope . Immunoelectron microscopy . Rat brain coronal sections ( 50 (cid:2) m thick ) were cut with a Vibratome and then washed in phosphate buffer ( PB ) ; free - floating sections were treated with NaBH 4 and locked with normal goat serum ( NGS ; 10 % ) in PBS , pH 7 . 4 , followed by incubations in the primaryandsecondaryantibodies . Rabbitanti - IRSp53antibodies ( num - ber 1452 ) were used at 2 (cid:2) g / ml diluted in PBS containing 2 % NGS . After several washes , sections were treated with a blocking solution containing 5 % BSA ( Sigma ) , 0 . 1 % BSA - c ( Aurion , Wageningene , TheNetherlands ) , and 5 % NGS ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) , followed by gold - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Fab coupled to 1 nm gold particles , Electron Microscopy Sciences , Fort Washington , PA ; diluted 1 : 50 in PBS contain - ing 2 % NGS ) . After postfixation with 2 % glutaraldehyde , sections were rinsed in 0 . 1 M sodium acetate , and gold particles were silver - enhanced using IntenseS - EM Silver ( Amersham Biosciences ) . After several washes in sodium acetate and PB , sections were postfixed with 0 . 5 % OsO 4 , con - trasted in 1 % uranyl acetate in maleate buffer , dehydrated , and embed - ded with epoxy resin ( Epon / Spurr ; Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . No specific immunoreactivity could be detected when either the primary or thesecondaryantibodywasomittedbeforesilverenhancement . Forelec - tron microscopy ( EM ) , (cid:1) 70 nm thin sections were cut on a Leica ultra - microtome , mounted on 200 mesh copper grids , contrasted with uranyl acetate and Sato’s lead , and then examined in a Philips Tecnai electron microscope at 80 kV . Digital micrographs were acquired with a Gatan ( Pleasanton , CA ) 12 - bit 1024 (cid:2) 1024 CCD camera .

Cultures were grown in Neurobasal medium ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) supplemented with B27 ( Invitrogen ) , 0 . 5 m M glutamine , and 12 . 5 (cid:2) M glutamate . Low - density cultures were used for colocalization studies . At 21 d in vitro ( DIV ) , hippocampal neurons were fixed in PBS containing 4 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized in PBS containing 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , and incubated with primary anti - bodies against IRSp53 ( 1452 ; 2 (cid:2) g / ml ) and PSD - 95 ( HM319 ; 3 (cid:2) g / ml ) , followed by Cy3 - or FITC - conjugated secondary antibodies . To deter - mine the synaptic localization of IRSp53 proteins , neurons at a medium - high density were transfected with HA - IRSp53 [ wild type ( WT ) or mu - tant ] plus PSD - 95 - EGFP at 17 DIV using the calcium phosphate method and stained at 19 DIV by double immunofluorescence staining with HA monoclonal ( for IRSp53 ; 1 (cid:2) g / ml ) and EGFP ( for PSD - 95 ; 1 : 1000 ) anti - bodies . To determine the effects of IRSp53 / WAVE2 constructs on den - dritic spines , neurons at 13 – 15 DIV were transfected with the indicated cDNA constructs and visualized at 16 – 17 DIV by double immunofluo - rescence staining with IRSp53 ( 1452 ; 2 (cid:2) g / ml ) , EGFP ( 1 : 1000 ) , and Shank ( 1123 ; 1 : 200 ) antibodies . Image acquisition and quantification . Fluorescent images were ac - quired using a confocal microscope ( LSM510 ; Zeiss , Oberkochen , Ger - many ) . The same parameter settings were used for all scans . Each exper - iment was repeated three to five times , and neuronal images for analysis were randomly selected . Morphometric measurements were performed using MetaMorph image analysis software ( Universal Imaging , West Chester , CA ) and in part by a blind manner . To determine the synaptic localization of IRSp53 , the immunofluorescence intensity of a PSD - 95 - positive spine was compared with that of an adjacent dendritic trunk . The intensity ratios of spine to dendrite were obtained from a total of (cid:1) 400 measurements ( 15 – 20 neurons and 20 spines / trunks per neuron ) . For the analysis of spine density , spines were defined as dendritic protru - sions of 0 . 5 – 3 (cid:2) m length , with or without a head . Spine density was measured by counting the number of spines on 10 – 12 neurons ( (cid:1) 100 (cid:2) mtotaldendriticlengthperneuron ) . Forspinedimensions , (cid:1) 300 – 500 spines ( 10 – 12neurons ) weremeasuredforeachcondition . Thelengthof each spine was measured by manually drawing a vertical line from the base of the neck to the furthest point on the spine head . Spine width was measured by drawing a maximal line perpendicular to the length line in the spine head . The density and dimensions of spines from a single neu - ron were grouped and averaged ; means from multiple individual neu - rons were averaged to obtain a population mean and SEM . Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test . Results IRSp53 interacts with PSD - 95 family proteins in vitro PSD - 95 is a key component of the PSD . To identify proteins that contribute to the PSD - 95 - dependent organization of postsynap - tic protein complexes , we searched for binding partners of PSD - 95 using the second PDZ domain ( aa 89 – 299 ) of PSD - 95 as bait and a human brain yeast two - hybrid cDNA library . One set of positive clones contained overlapping fragments of IRSp53 that end with Ser - Thr - Val , a potential class I PDZ domain - binding motif ( Sheng and Sala , 2001 ) . In the yeast two - hybrid assay , IRSp53 interacted with the first two PDZ domains of all known isoforms of the PSD - 95 family ( PSD - 95 / SAP90 , SAP97 , chapsyn - 110 / PSD - 93 , and SAP102 ) and the S - SCAM multi - PDZ protein but not with the PDZ domains of Shank1 and ZO - 1 ( Fig . 1 A ) . A point mutation at the C - terminal residue of IRSp53 ( Val521 to Ala ) eliminated these interactions ( Fig . 1 A ) , suggest - ing that IRSp53 interacts with PSD - 95 through the canonical PDZ interaction . In a GST pull - down assay , GST - IRSp53 ( aa 470 – 521 ) , but not GST - IRSp53 lacking the last four residues ( aa 470 – 517 ) or GST alone , brought down all known PSD - 95 family proteins and S - SCAM expressed in heterologous cells ( Fig . 1 B ) . In a coimmunoprecipitation analysis in heterologous cells , full - length IRSp53 ( IRSp53WT ) , but not the IRSp53 mutant lacking the last four residues ( IRSp53 (cid:3) C ) , formed a complex with all known PSD - 95 family proteins and S - SCAM ( Fig . 1 C – G ) . SinglytransfectedPSD - 95familyproteinsandS - SCAMwerenot immunoprecipitated in control experiments ( Fig . 1 C – G , lane 4 ) . The overall coimmunoprecipitation efficiencies , however , were not high , (cid:1) 1 – 2 % of the inputs ( Fig . 1 C – G ) . Together , these results sug - gest that IRSp53 associates with all known members of the PSD - 95 family and S - SCAM in vitro through the canonical PDZ interaction . Similar spatiotemporal expression patterns and complex formation of IRSp53 and PSD - 95 in brain To determine the expression pattern of IRSp53 in brain , we gen - erated polyclonal antibodies against full - length IRSp53 ( aa 1 – 521 ; rabbit 1452 and guinea pig 1454 ) . These antibodies recog - nized two previously reported major IRSp53 bands ( 58 and 53 kDa ) in brain samples ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ) ; these may represent splice variants ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ; Okamura - Oho et al . , 2001 ; Alvarez et al . , 2002 ) . IRSp53 showed widespread expression in various regions of the rat brain , including cortex , cerebellum , hippocampus , and striatum ( Fig . 2 A ) , similar to PSD - 95 ( Cho et al . , 1992 ) . During development , the expression levels of IRSp53 and PSD - 95 sharply increased together during the second and third postnatal weeks ( Fig . 2 B ) . In brain subcellular fractions , IRSp53 and PSD - 95 cofractionated into the crude synaptosomal ( P2 ) and synaptic membrane ( LP1 ) fractions ( Fig . 2 C ) . In PSD fractions , both IRSp53 and PSD - 95 were enriched in all three PSD fractions ; IRSp53 was less enriched in the PSD III fraction ( Fig . 2 D ) , suggesting that IRSp53 is less tightly associated with the PSD than is PSD - 95 . Together , these results suggest that IRSp53 and PSD - 95 have similar spatiotemporal expression pat - terns in brain . To determine the formation of a complex between IRSp53 and PSD - 95 in brain , we performed coimmunoprecipitation ex - periments ( Fig . 2 E – J ) . When crude synaptosomal extracts of adult rat brain were immunoprecipitated with IRSp53 antibod - ies , PSD - 95 and chapsyn - 110 , but not SAP97 , SAP102 , or S - SCAM , were pulled down ( Fig . 2 E ) . IRSp53 antibodies pulled down only a small fraction of Shank ( Fig . 2 E ) , a known binding partner of IRSp53 ( Bockmann et al . , 2002 ; Soltau et al . , 2002 ) . Control rabbit IgG did not bring down any protein tested ( Fig . 2 E ) . In the reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments , PSD - 95 antibodies brought down IRSp53 , along with NR2B ( a positive control ) ( Fig . 2 F ) . Vinculin , a negative control , was not pulled down by PSD - 95 antibodies or guinea pig IgG ( Fig . 2 F ) . Similarly , chapsyn - 110 , but not SAP97 , SAP102 , or S - SCAM an - tibodies , brought down IRSp53 ( Fig . 2 G – J ) . Together , these re - sults suggest that IRSp53 forms complexes with specific members of the PSD - 95 family in brain . Colocalization of IRSp53 with PSD - 95 in cultured neurons and synaptic localization of IRSp53 in brain sections Double immunofluorescence staining of cultured hippocampal neurons revealed that IRSp53 was distributed to dendritic spines , whereitcolocalizedwithPSD - 95 ( Fig . 3 A ) . IRSp53wasalsodetected in regions outside the synapse , including the cell body and the den - dritic trunk ( Fig . 3 A ) , consistent with the observed presence of a portion of IRSp53 in the extrasynaptic ( S2 ) fraction ( Fig . 2 C ) . In rat brain , at light microscopic level , IRSp53 was detected in various brain regions , including cortex , hippocampus , and cere - bellum ( data not shown ) , consistent with our immunoblot re - sults ( Fig . 2 A ) and previous reports ( Abbott et al . , 1999 ; Bock - mann et al . , 2002 ) . IRSp53 signals were detected in the cell bodies and apical dendrites of principal neurons ( e . g . , pyramidal cells in cortex and hippocampus and Purkinje cells in cerebellum ) ( see Fig . 3 , B and C , for images from the CA1 region of hippocampus ) . Choietal . • IRSp53PromotesSpineMorphogenesis J . Neurosci . , January26 , 2005 • 25 ( 4 ) : 869 – 879 • 871 In forebrain , IRSp53 was not detected in GABAergic local circuit neurons ( data not shown ) . Numerous puncta were positive in the neuropil ( Fig . 3 D – F ) ( CA1 region ) . Because satisfactory PSD - 95 immuno - staining of synapses in brain is difficult to achieve ( presumably because of poor anti - body penetration ) unless sections are pre - treated with proteases ( Fukaya and Wa - tanabe , 2000 ) , we did not try to detect colocalization of IRSp53 and PSD - 95 . How - ever , double immunofluorescence staining for IRSp53 and the presynaptic marker syn - aptophysin indicated that most of the IRSp53 puncta were closely apposed to or partially overlapped with synaptophysin puncta ( Fig . 3 D – F ) , suggesting that IRSp53 concentrates at synaptic sites in brain . To - gether , these results suggest that IRSp53 co - localizes with PSD - 95 at synaptic sites . Ultrastructural localization of IRSp53 Despite growing recognition of the impor - tance of IRSp53 in synaptic function , elec - tron microscopic analysis of subcellular distribution at the synapse has not been reported . We used pre - embedding immu - nogold EM to determine the ultrastructural localization of IRSp53 in rat brain , focusing on the CA1 region of hippocampus ( Fig . 4 ) . Silver - enhancedimmunogoldparticleswere most numerous at postsynaptic sites , where they labeled both the PSD and spine cyto - plasm ( Fig . 4 A – E ) . Therewasnoobviousas - sociation of immunogold particles with the extrasynaptic spine membrane or intracyto - plasmic membranes . Axon terminals also exhibited occasional immunolabeling ( Fig . 4 B , C , E ) , but the label was predominantly postsynaptic . Both the C terminus and the SH3 domain are important for the synaptic localization of IRSp53 IRSp53 is less tightly associated with the PSD than is PSD - 95 ( Fig . 2 D ) , suggesting that the IRSp53 – PSD - 95 interaction may play a role in the synaptic localization of IRSp53 . A previous study has shown that the SH3 domain of IRSp53 binds to a proline - rich region in Shank ( Bockmann et al . , 2002 ; Soltau et al . , 2002 ) , suggesting that the SH3 domain may be involved in the postsynaptic localization of IRSp53 . To test these possibilities , we tested the synaptic localization of the following IRSp53 constructs ( Fig . 5 ) : IRSp53 WT , IRSp53 (cid:3) C ( a mutant lacking the PSD - 95 - binding C - terminal residues ) , IRSp53 SH3 mut ( I403P ; an SH3 domain mutant incapable of binding Shank ) ( Fig . 5 A ) , and IRSp53 SH3 mut plus (cid:3) C ( double mutant ) . When expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons at 17 DIV and visualized at 19 DIV , IRSp53 WT showed significant accumulation at PSD - 95 - positive dendritic spines ( Fig . 5 B ) . In contrast , IRSp53 (cid:3) C was mainly diffusely distributed throughout the neuron ( Fig . 5 C ) . IRSp53 SH3 mut showed a synaptic distribution between those of IRSp53 WT and IRSp53 (cid:3) C ( Fig . 5 D ) .

In these targeting exper - iments , we coexpressed PSD - 95 , along with the IRSp53 con - structs , so that the amount of PSD - 95 or PSD - 95 - associated Shank would not become a limiting factor for synaptic IRSp53 targeting . TheexpressionlevelsofexogenousIRSp53andPSD - 95 were approximately two to three times higher than those of en - dogenous proteins ( fluorescent intensities in transfected neurons relative to untransfected neurons : IRSp53 WT , 3 . 41 (cid:8) 0 . 57 ; IRSp53 SH3 mut , 3 . 85 (cid:8) 0 . 12 ; IRSp53 (cid:3) C , 3 . 13 (cid:8) 0 . 10 ; IRSp53 SH3 mut plus (cid:3) C ; PSD - 95 , 3 . 54 (cid:8) 0 . 58 ; n (cid:9) 5 ) . In quantitative analysis , IRSp53 (cid:3) C showed a synaptic localization ( the ratio of immunofluorescence intensity at a spine over that at an adjacent dendritic trunk , 0 . 78 (cid:8) 0 . 03 ; n (cid:9) 150 spines ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 5 F ) that is significantly lower than IRSp53WT ( 2 . 15 (cid:8) 0 . 02 ; n (cid:9) 150 ) ( Fig . 5 F ) . The synaptic accumulation of IRSp53 SH3 mut ( 1 . 46 (cid:8) 0 . 02 ; n (cid:9) 150 ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 5 F ) was also significantly lower than IRSp53 WT , although higher than that of IRSp53 (cid:3) C . Double - mutant IRSp53 SH3 mut plus (cid:3) C displayed the lowest synaptic localization ( 0 . 49 (cid:8) 0 . 01 ; n (cid:9) 150 ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 compared with WT ) ( Fig . 5 F ) . These results suggest that both the C terminus and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 are important determinants of its synaptic localization . Overexpression of IRSp53 in cultured neurons selectively increases the density of dendritic spines Rac1 / Cdc42 small GTPases have been shown to regulate spine morphogenesis ( Luo et al . , 1996 ; Nakayama et al . , 2000 ; Tashiro et al . , 2000 ; Irie and Yamaguchi , 2002 ; Scott et al . , 2003 ) . Given that IRSp53 is a downstream effector of Rac1 / Cdc42 in non - neural cells , we tested whether IRSp53 is involved in the regulation of dendritic spines ( Fig . 6 ) . To this end , cul - tured neurons at 15 DIV were transfected with IRSp53 , and the effects of IRSp53 overexpression on the density and mor - phology of dendritic spines were analyzed at 22 DIV . Interestingly , IRSp53 overex - pression significantly increased the linear densityofdendriticspines ( 7 . 90 (cid:8) 0 . 12per 10 (cid:2) m dendrite ; n (cid:9) 12 neurons ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 6 B , D ) compared with control neurons transfected with EGFP alone ( 4 . 99 (cid:8) 0 . 52 per 10 (cid:2) m dendrite ; n (cid:9) 14 ) ( Fig . 6 A , D ) . In contrast , IRSp53 (cid:3) C did not increase spine density in transfected neurons ( 4 . 39 (cid:8) 0 . 02 ; n (cid:9) 10 ; p (cid:9) 0 . 69 compared with EGFP alone controls ) ( Fig . 6 C , D ) , indicating that synaptic localiza - tion of IRSp53 is important for its spine - promoting effects . In contrast , morphometric analysis in - dicatedthatthelengthofdendriticspinesonIRSp53 - expressing neurons was not signifi - cantlydifferent ( 1 . 12 (cid:8) 0 . 05 (cid:2) m ; n (cid:9) 10 ; p (cid:9) 0 . 85 ) ( Fig . 6 E ) from that of control neurons ( EGFP alone ; 1 . 13 (cid:8) 0 . 05 (cid:2) m ; n (cid:9) 11 ) ( Fig . 6 E ) . Similarly , the width of the dendritic spines in IRSp53 - transfected neurons ( 0 . 63 (cid:8) 0 . 01 (cid:2) m ; n (cid:9) 10 ; p (cid:9) 0 . 58 ) was not significantly different from that of control neurons ( 0 . 61 (cid:8) 0 . 04 (cid:2) m ; n (cid:9) 11 ) ( Fig . 6 F ) . IRSp53 (cid:3) C did not change spine mor - phology ( length , 1 . 16 (cid:8) 0 . 05 ; n (cid:9) 15 ; p (cid:9) 0 . 92 compared with EGFP alone controls ; width , 0 . 77 (cid:8) 0 . 03 ; n (cid:9) 15 ; p (cid:9) 0 . 82 com - pared with EGFP alone controls ) ( Fig . 6 E , F ) . Together , these results indicate that IRSp53 selectively increases spine density with minimal effects on spine size ( length and width ) . siRNA downregulation of IRSp53 decreases the density and size of spines Because IRSp53 overexpression in cultured neurons increases spine density ( Fig . 6 ) , we tested whether IRSp53 is required for Figure2 .

Neurosci . , January26 , 2005 • 25 ( 4 ) : 869 – 879 • 873 the maintenance of normal spine density ( Fig . 7 ) . To this end , we generated an IRSp53 siRNA construct ( pSUPER IRSp53 ) . When coexpressed with IRSp53 in heterologous cells , the expression of IRSp53wassignificantlyreducedto13 . 7 (cid:8) 1 . 2 % of control levels ( n (cid:9) 3 ; data not shown ) . When this siRNA construct was expressed in cultured neurons for 3 d ( from 13 – 16 DIV ) , the expression of en - dogenous IRSp53 was markedly reduced to 10 . 5 (cid:8) 0 . 5 % ( n (cid:9) 7 ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 7 A , C ) of that in control neurons trans - fected with the empty pSUPER vector ( Fig . 7 A , B ) . When the effects of pSUPER IRSp53 were quantified , the linear density of den - dritic spines on siRNA - transfected neu - rons was significantly reduced ( 3 . 0 (cid:8) 0 . 09 per 10 (cid:2) m dendrite ; n (cid:9) 13 ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 7 C , D ) compared with that of control neurons transfected with the empty pSUPER vector ( 4 . 30 (cid:8) 0 . 14 per 10 (cid:2) m dendrite ; n (cid:9) 12 ) ( Fig . 7 B , D ) . Intrigu - ingly , the length and width of the dendritic spines on siRNA - transfected neurons were also significantly reduced ( length , 0 . 43 (cid:8) 0 . 02 (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) 10 , * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ; width , 0 . 24 (cid:8) 0 . 01 (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) 10 , * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 7 E , F ) compared with those of control neurons ( length , 0 . 88 (cid:8) 0 . 03 (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) 10 ; width , 0 . 58 (cid:8) 0 . 02 (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) 10 ) ( Fig . 7 E , F ) . These results suggest that IRSp53 is re - quired for the maintenance of both spine density and size . A dominant - negative IRSp53 SH3 mutant decreases the density and size of spines The present results suggest that IRSp53 is important for spine regulation ( Figs . 6 , 7 ) , which prompts the question of just how IRSp53 exerts its spine - promoting effects . One possibility is that IRSp53 , through its SH3 domain , binds to various actin - modulating proteins , including WAVE2 , Mena , and Shank . To test this hypothesis , we used dominant - negative IRSp53 SH3 mutants that cannot link activated Rac1 / Cdc42 to SH3 - binding downstream effec - tors . When the IRSp53 SH3 mut ( I403P ) ( incapable of binding Shank , as described above ) was further tested for WAVE2 binding , there was no detectable interac - tion with WAVE2 , as inferred from the lack of coimmunoprecipitation with the SH3 - binding proline - rich region of WAVE2 in heterologous cells ( Fig . 8 A ) . This suggests that the IRSp53 SH3 mut ( I403P ) is likely to block the coupling of activated Rac1 / Cdc42 with various downstream SH3 - binding proteins in a dominant - negative manner . When IRSp53 SH3 mut was expressed in cultured neurons for 2 d ( 15 – 17 DIV ) , the density of dendritic spines was significantly decreased ( 1 . 76 (cid:8) 0 . 18 per 10 (cid:2) m dendrite ; n (cid:9) 11 ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 8 C , D ) compared with control neurons ( 4 . 82 (cid:8) 0 . 36 per 10 (cid:2) m dendrite ; n (cid:9) 12 ) ( Fig . 8 B , D ) . In addition , the length and width of the dendritic spines on IRSp53 SH3 mut - transfected neurons were significantly reduced ( length , 0 . 63 (cid:8) 0 . 02 (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) Figure 3 .

Notably , theexpressionofIRSp53SH3mutsignificantlyreducedthe synaptic localization of Shank , one of the IRSp53 SH3 - interacting proteins , as determined by the spine / dendrite immunofluorescence ratio ( 1 . 45 (cid:8) 0 . 03inIRSp53SH3mut - expressingneurons , n (cid:9) 120 , vs 2 . 63 (cid:8) 0 . 05 in EGFP alone - expressing control neurons , n (cid:9) 120 ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) . A possible explanation for this is that Shank may de - pend on IRSp53 interaction for its synaptic localization . Alterna - tively , this effect may be caused by the general shrinkage of spines associated with spine density reduction . Together , these results suggest that the SH3 domain plays an important role in the IRSp53 - dependent regulation of dendritic spines . A dominant - negative WAVE2 proline - rich region decreases spine density and size WAVE2 , which binds to the IRSp53 SH3 via its proline - rich re - gion , links activated Rac1 to the Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation complex - dependent formation of lamellipodia in non - neural cells ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Miki and Takenawa , 2002 ) . A useful dom - inant negative that disrupts the functional connection between IRSp53 and WAVE2 is a construct containing the proline - rich region of WAVE2 ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) . When this dominant - negative construct ( termed WAVE2 Pro ) was expressed in cul - tured neurons for 3 d ( 14 – 17 DIV ) , spine density was signifi - cantly decreased ( 3 . 01 (cid:8) 0 . 10 ; n (cid:9) 11 ; * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 9 B , C ) compared with control neurons transfected with EGFP alone ( 5 . 06 (cid:8) 0 . 15 ; n (cid:9) 10 ) ( Fig . 9 A , C ) . In addition , the length and width of dendritic spines on WAVE2 Pro - transfected neurons were significantly reduced ( length , 0 . 60 (cid:8) 0 . 04 , n (cid:9) 9 , * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ; width , 0 . 46 (cid:8) 0 . 01 , n (cid:9) 9 , * p (cid:5) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 9 D , E ) , compared with those of control neurons ( length , 0 . 96 (cid:8) 0 . 03 , n (cid:9) 9 ; width , 0 . 55 (cid:8) 0 . 01 , n (cid:9) 9 ) ( Fig . 9 D , E ) . WAVE2 Pro expression did not signifi - cantly change the synaptic localization of IRSp53 , as determined by the spine / dendrite immunofluorescence ratio ( 1 . 28 (cid:8) 0 . 03 in WAVE2 Pro - expressing neurons , n (cid:9) 100 , vs 1 . 31 (cid:8) 0 . 02 in EGFP alone - expressing control neurons , n (cid:9) 100 ; p (cid:9) 0 . 81 ) . A possible explanation for this is that IRSp53 , although its SH3 domain is mainly blocked by WAVE2 Pro , can still be targeted to synapses by the interaction of its CterminuswithPSD - 95 . Together , thesere - sults suggest that WAVE2 may be an impor - tant mediator of IRSp53 - dependent spine regulation . Discussion Role of the IRSp53 – PSD - 95 interaction in the synaptic localization of IRSp53 In the present study , we demonstrated that IRSp53 interacts with PSD - 95 . This cor - roborates the recent finding by Soltau et al . ( 2004 ) that IRSp53 associates with PSD - 95 . In addition , we found that IRSp53 as - sociates with specific members of the PSD - 95 family ( PSD - 95 and chapsyn - 110 / PSD - 93 ) in brain ( Fig . 2 E – J ) . This in vivo specificity could be attributable to differ - ences in the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of PSD - 95 family proteins ; PSD - 95 and chapsyn - 110 are generally synaptic , whereas SAP97 and SAP102 are more widespread and implicated in traf - ficking ( Kim and Sheng , 2004 ) . Previous work showed that a member of the transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory pro - tein / stargazin family interacts specifically with PSD - 95 and chapsyn - 110 / PSD - 93 ( Dakoji et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , preferen - tial associations have been demonstrated for PSD - 95 and NR2A , SAP102 and NR2B , and SAP97 and glutamate receptor 1 ( Leo - nard et al . , 1998 ; Sans et al . , 2000 ; Townsend et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , our results contribute to the emerging notion that PSD - 95 family proteins have differential functions . Our data indicate that both PSD - 95 and Shank interactions are required for synaptic IRSp53 localization ( Fig . 5 ) . Direct comparison of the relative contribution of PSD - 95 and Shank to synaptic IRSp53 localization is difficult , because the relative amounts of PSD - 95 , Shank , and IRSp53 in transfected neurons , in addition to IRSp53 mutation / deletion , may alter the experi - mental outcomes . However , in vivo coimmunoprecipitation re - sults indicate that a much smaller portion of Shank , compared with PSD - 95 , is in complex with IRSp53 ( Fig . 2 E ) . Because PSD - 95 is several fold more abundant than Shank1 , as demon - strated by a quantitative mass spectrometric analysis ( Peng et al . , 2004 ) , this result suggests that the majority of IRSp53 is associ - ated with PSD - 95 or that IRSp53 has a higher affinity for PSD - 95 relative to Shank . Thus , it is likely that , in the PSD , the C - terminal motif of IRSp53 is occupied by PSD - 95 , whereas the SH3 domain may be free for other functions . The binding partners of this SH3 domain vary depending on the nature of the associated small GTPases ( Rac1 vs Cdc42 ) . Thus , it would be advantageous for the C terminus to engage in synaptic anchoring through the generally strongPDZinteraction , whereastheSH3domainservesasaversatile Rac1 / Cdc42 - dependent switch that associates with various target proteins for dynamic regulation of spine morphogenesis . Role of IRSp53 in the regulation of dendritic spines Our results indicate that IRSp53 overexpression selectively in - creases spine density ( Fig . 6 ) . Conversely , siRNA - mediated knock - down of IRSp53 reduces spine density and size ( Fig . 7 ) . Figure4 . Immunogold - EMlocalizationofIRSp53intheCA1stratumradiatumofrathippocampus .

Neurosci . , January26 , 2005 • 25 ( 4 ) : 869 – 879 • 875 IRSp53 SH3 mut and WAVE2 Pro reduce spine density and size ( Figs . 8 , 9 ) . Because IRSp53 links activated Rac1 / Cdc42 to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in non - neural cells ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) , these results suggest that IRSp53 may be an important regulator of spine morphogenesis that acts downstream of Rac1 / Cdc42 in neurons , along with PAK and N - WASP , which have been suggested to be downstream effectors of Rac1 / Cdc42 in EphB receptor - dependent spine morphogenesis ( Irie and Yamaguchi , 2002 ; Penzes et al . , 2003 ) . The SH3 domain appears to be important in the spine - promoting effects of IRSp53 . In support of this , IRSp53 SH3 mut and WAVE2 Pro reduced the spine density and size ( Figs . 8 , 9 ) . In addition , these dominant - negative effects resembled those seen following siRNA - mediated knock - down of IRSp53 , suggesting that the IRSp53 effects are , in large part , mediated by the SH3 domain . Moreover , IRSp53 SH3 mut , despite containing the N - terminal IMD domain that regulates the actin cytoskeleton independent of the SH3 domain ( Yamagishi et al . , 2004 ) , did not have any spine - promoting effects ( Fig . 8 ) , suggesting that the SH3 domain is more important . Together , these results strongly suggest that IRSp53 links activated Rac1 / Cdc42 to downstream effectors through its SH3 domain . The above results raise the question of how the IRSp53SH3 mediates the spine - promoting effects of IRSp53 . One possibility is that the IRSp53 SH3 domain interacts with actin regulating downstream effectors . Known binding partners of the IRSp53 SH3 that are implicated in actin regulation include WAVE2 , Mena , and Shank ( Miki et al . , 2000 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Bock - mann et al . , 2002 ; Soltau et al . , 2002 ) . We have shown here that WAVE2 Pro reduces spine density and size ( Fig . 9 ) , suggesting that the effects of IRSp53 may be mediated by WAVE2 . WAVE2 is expressed in the brain at both the mRNA and protein levels ( Suetsugu et al . , 1999 ) ( J . Choi and E . Kim , unpublished results ) , although its neuronal functions remain to be determined . The Figure5 . BoththeCterminusandtheSH3domainareimportantforthesynapticlocaliza - tionofIRSp53 .

Neurosci . , January26 , 2005 • 25 ( 4 ) : 869 – 879 Choietal . • IRSp53PromotesSpineMorphogenesis IRSp53 - induced increase in spine density may be attributable to the association of WAVE2 with the Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation com - plex ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) , which adds new branches to the sides of existing actin filaments , causing dynamic extension of actin - based structures . Conversely , the siRNA - induced reduction in spine density and size may be attributable to spine shrinkage caused by a lack of basal level activation of the Arp2 / 3 machinery . However , it should be noted that IRSp53 SH3 mut ( I403P ) dis - rupts the interaction of IRSp53 with both Shank and WAVE2 ( Figs . 5 A , 8 A ) , suggesting that overexpression of WAVE2 Pro dominant negative may block SH3 binding of WAVE2 as well as other proteins . Another candidate that may mediate the IRSp53 effects is Mena , which is known to link Cdc42 activation to filop - odia formation in non - neural cells ( Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krug - mann et al . , 2001 ) and is widely expressed in both developing and , to a lesser degree , adult brain ( Lanier et al . , 1999 ) . Mena is required for the formation of growth cone filopodia and is impli - cated in axon outgrowth and guidance ( Lebrand et al . , 2004 ) , but its role in spine morphogenesis remains an open question . Shank may be the best characterized protein among the known binding partners of the IRSp53 SH3 . Shank has been shown to regulate spine morphogenesis ( Sala et al . , 2001 ) . In particular , Shank acts in the maturation of spines , causing the widthandlengthofspinestoincreasewithoutsignificantlyaffect - ing spine density ( Sala et al . , 2001 ) , which contrast to the selective effects of IRSp53 on spine density in this study . Cortactin , a Shank - associated protein that binds to F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 actin nucleation complex ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Uruno et al . , 2001 ) , has been shown to induce the formation of protrusions in aspiny neurons and to be required for the maintenance of normal spine density , as demonstrated by siRNA downregulation ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) . However , the main effect of cortactin overexpres - sion is to increase the length of spines but not their width and density ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) , which again differs from the spine density - specific effects of IRSp53 ( Fig . 6 ) . Another Shank - associated protein that may contribute to the IRSp53 - dependent spine regulation is Abp1 , an F - actin binding protein that is en - Figure7 . siRNAdownregulationofIRSp53decreasesthedensityandsizeofspines .

Notably , Abp1 is recruited to spines by synaptic stimulation ( Qualmann et al . , 2004 ) , but the specific role for Abp1 in spine regulation is not known . Thus , it remains to be determined whether Shank , cor - tactin , and Abp1 mediate the effects of IRSp53 . Possible role of PSD - 95 as an organizer of the Rac1 signaling pathway in spines Our data show that PSD - 95 is important for the synaptic local - ization of IRSp53 , a downstream effector of activated Rac1 / Cdc42 . PSD - 95 is also required for the synaptic localization of Kalirin - 7 [ Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) ] ( Penzes et al . , 2001 ) . These results suggest that PSD - 95 , which can form multimers ( Kim et al . , 1996 ; Hsueh et al . , 1997 ; Chris - topherson et al . , 2003 ) , may bring Kalirin - 7 and IRSp53 close together and mediate their possible functional coupling ( activa - tion of IRSp53 by Kalirin - 7 - activated Rac1 ) . In addition , Shank , which is linked to PSD - 95 through guanylate kinase - associated protein ( GKAP ) ( Sheng and Kim , 2000 ) , might interact with (cid:1) PIX ( Rac1 / Cdc42 GEF ) ( Park et al . , 2003 ) to bring (cid:1) PIX close to IRSp53 for their possible functional coupling ( activation of IRSp53 by (cid:1) PIX - activated Rac1 / Cdc42 ) . Together , it appears that the well - known PSD - 95 - GKAP - Shank axis may bring together various Rac1 / Cdc42 - related signaling molecules ( Kalirin - 7 , (cid:1) PIX , and IRSp53 ) and coordinate their functional coupling to regulate spine morphogenesis . A correlation between PSD - 95 assembly and spine morpho - genesis has been demonstrated in several studies . Time - lapse im - aging revealed that local assembly of PSD - 95 spatiotemporally correlates with spine formation ( Okabe et al . , 2001 ) . PSD - 95 overexpression in cultured neurons increases the density and size of dendritic spines ( El - Husseini et al . , 2000 ) . The degradation of PSD - 95 triggered by an inducible kinase results in the loss of dendritic spines ( Pak and Sheng , 2003 ) . Considering the impor - tantroleofPSD - 95insynapticIRSp53localizationandtheroleof IRSp53 in spine regulation , dynamic changes in the synaptic con - tent of PSD - 95 during development and plasticity may be linked via concomitant changes in synaptic IRSp53 levels to the regula - tion of spine morphogenesis . In conclusion , our results indicate that IRSp53 interacts with two specific members of the PSD - 95 family , PSD - 95 and chapsyn - 110 / PSD - 93 , and that this interaction is important for synaptic IRSp53 localization . In addition , we have demonstrated that IRSp53 , a downstream effector of Rac1 / Cdc42 , regulates spine morphogenesis through its SH3 domain . The next step is to identifythemolecularmechanismsactingdownstreamofIRSp53andgeneticallyconfirmtherolesforIRSp53intheregulationofdendriticspines .
