We evaluated 340 articles included in prognostic marker meta - analyses ( Database 1 ) and 1575 articles on cancer prognostic markers published in 2005 ( Database 2 ) . For each article , we examined whether the abstract reported any statis - tically signiﬁcant prognostic effect for any marker and any outcome ( ‘positive’ articles ) . ‘Negative’ articles were further examined for statements made by the investigators to over - come the absence of prognostic statistical signiﬁcance . We also examined how the articles of Database 1 had presented the relative risks that were included in the respective meta - analyses . ‘Positive’ prognostic articles comprised 90 . 6 % and 95 . 8 % in Databases 1 and 2 , respectively . Most of the ‘negative’ prognostic articles claimed signiﬁcance for other anal - yses , expanded on non - signiﬁcant trends or offered apologies that were occasionally remote from the original study aims . Only ﬁve articles in Database 1 ( 1 . 5 % ) and 21 in Data - base 2 ( 1 . 3 % ) were fully ‘negative’ for all presented results in the abstract and without efforts to expand on non - signiﬁcant trends or to defend the importance of the marker with other arguments . Of the statistically non - signiﬁcant relative risks in the meta - analyses , 25 % had been presented as statistically signiﬁcant in the primary papers using different analyses compared with the respective meta - analysis . We conclude that almost all articles on cancer prognostic marker studies highlight some statistically signiﬁcant results . Under strong reporting bias , statistical signiﬁcance loses its discriminating ability for the impor - tance of prognostic markers . (cid:2) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd . 1 . Introduction Cancer prognosis has been a ﬁeld of intensive research for many years . Besides traditional clinical markers , basic and translational research have generated hundreds of candi - date markers for prediction of outcomes in cancer pa - tients . 1 , 2 The expectation is that eventually some of these markers should also be clinically useful to change clinical practice . 3 – 6 However , progress in ‘individualised’ medicine based on prognostic information has been slow , in contrast to the vast amount of published data . Several methodologi - cal problems have been implicated for prognostic marker studies . They include poor study design and execution and poor and selective reporting of results . 1 , 7 – 10 0959 - 8049 / $ - see front matter (cid:2) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd . doi : 10 . 1016 / j . ejca . 2007 . 08 . 030 * Corresponding author : Address : Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology , University of Ioannina School of Medicine , Ioannina 45110 , Greece .

E UROPE AN JOU RNAL O F CAN CER 4 3 ( 20 0 7 ) 2 5 59 – 2 5 7 9 available at www . sciencedirect . com journal homepage : www . ejconline . com Selective reporting is a particular threat to the credibility of this literature . It includes both publication bias 11 , 12 and selective reporting of speciﬁc analyses and outcomes favour - ing results that pass the threshold of nominal statistical sig - niﬁcance . 9 These biases have been well documented even for rigorous study designs , such as randomised trials . 13 , 14 Selective reporting has been difﬁcult to probe for prognostic investigations . There is no study registration mechanism and study protocols are typically not available . 15 Therefore , here we aimed to probe into these biases using an indirect ap - proach . We evaluated two large samples of articles on cancer prognostic markers and estimated how many of them claim nominally statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings . Publication and other selective reporting biases all cause an excess of statisti - cally signiﬁcant results in the literature . 16 , 17 With publication bias , studies with non - signiﬁcant results would be left unpub - lished ; thus , the published literature would be relatively en - riched in statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings . With selective reporting of speciﬁc analyses or outcomes , the end result is the same : studies that should have been presented as ‘nega - tive’ ( non - statistically signiﬁcant ) based on their primary analyses get published with ‘positive’ ( statistically signiﬁcant ) results based on data dredging and manipulated analyses . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Search strategy and eligibility criteria for cancer prognostic marker studies We used two large databases of published articles . The ﬁrst ( Database 1 ) comprised 340 articles on cancer prognostic markers with data that were included in meta - analyses of cancer prognostic markers published until 2005 . The database has been built as part of a previous project . 10 In that project , we have identiﬁed 20 meta - analyses of prognostic markers for cancer by searching MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 2005 . The primary studies included in these meta - analyses were used to create Database 1 in the current project . The second database ( Database 2 ) assembled articles on cancerprognosticmarkerspublishedin2005 .

We also added terms for commonly used molecular markers ( Appendix ) . For both databases , we accepted articles that had an ab - stract and that addressed with original data at least one po - tential prognostic marker , as deﬁned by the recently published guidelines for transparent and complete reporting of cancer prognostic marker studies ( REMARK consensus 19 ) , in any malignancy and for any outcome . When screening for Database 2 , we have excluded letters , case reports , meta - analyses and reviews . 2 . 2 . Data extraction Two investigators extracted data from eligible articles inde - pendently , and then discussed to resolve controversies . A third investigator settled remaining discrepancies . For each article we examined whether the abstract reported at least one statistically signiﬁcant prognostic effect for any marker and any eligible outcome , regardless of whether any non - sta - tistically signiﬁcant results were also reported or not . Statistical signiﬁcance could be conveyed either by a p - value < 0 . 05 or an effect metric with 95 % conﬁdence interval ( CI ) falling entirely on one side of the null ; or only a statement by the authors that the prognostic effect was statistically signiﬁcant . We recorded whether that statement contained the words ‘statistical ( ly ) ’ and / or ‘signiﬁcant ( ly ) ’ . If only other words had been used ( e . g . ‘associated’ / ‘related’ / ‘corre - lated’ / ‘larger’ / ‘smaller’ / ‘higher’ / ‘lower’ / ‘better’ / ‘worse’ ) , we screened the full text of the article to conﬁrm the allusion of statistical signiﬁcance . For articles where the statement contained the words ‘statistical ( ly ) ’ and / or ‘signiﬁcant ( ly ) ’ , we examined the full text for one - third of them ( 85 / 264 ) and found no occasion where the full text contradicted the statis - tical signiﬁcance of the association presented in the abstract ; therefore , we assume that practically all of these statements convey statistically signiﬁcant results . Articles with claims of statistical signiﬁcance ( based on p - value , CI or conﬁrmed language ) are collectively termed ‘positive’ for convenience . We further examined the articles that did not make any such clear statements on statistical signiﬁcance for prognos - tic effects in their abstract ( ‘negative’ articles ) . Authors may use various ways of reporting their results , to make them more attractive to the editors , peer - reviewers and readers . 9 , 19 We considered the following possibilities based on what the abstract stated : Claiming signiﬁcance for other analyses : when authors pre - sented formally statistically signiﬁcant results for other anal - yses that do not reﬂect directly the assessment of prognostic effects ( e . g . correlation analyses between baseline characteristics ) . Expanding on non - signiﬁcant trends : when authors discussed trends for any prognostic effect ( s ) for any outcome ( s ) without formal statistical signiﬁcance . Lack of formal statistical sig - niﬁcance could be visible in the abstract itself based on the presented p - value and / or CIs ; alternatively no numbers were mentioned in the abstract , but the full text revealed the lack of formal statistical signiﬁcance . Apologies : when authors suggested other / larger / different studies might reveal the prognostic effect ( s ) or mentioned that the examined factor ( s ) are still important in other re - gards – still useful to pursue further . We recorded the exact phrasing for each otherwise ‘nega - tive’ article that used any of these three mechanisms above alone or in combination . All ‘negative’ articles were examined by all three investigators . Discrepancies were discussed for consensus . Results from the two databases are presented separately and the proportions of ‘positive’ articles and other categories are compared by v 2 tests . Since Database 1 was created from studies included in meta - analyses , one may wonder whether meta - analyses may be more likely to be performed for associ - ations expected to be statistically signiﬁcant ; however , there is no documentation for such selection bias . Selection bias is also possible in the opposite direction : some meta - analyses may use very comprehensive search strategies to unearth and 2560 EU RO PEA N J OURNAL OF CANCE R 4 3 ( 2 0 07 ) 2 55 9 – 2 57 9 include prognostic effect data that appear in ﬁne print in arti - cles where the main focus is different ; this ﬁne print informa - tion may be more likely to be ‘negative’ . 9 , 20 – 22 Conversely , Database 2 included studies regardless of whether there was interest for meta - analysis ; Database 2 was also less likely to include articles where prognostic effect data appeared in ﬁne print and the article was not readily recognised as a prognos - tic study . To address this issue , we checked in PubMed how many articles of Database 1 would be retrieved using the algo - rithm of Database 2 , without restriction for year . Furthermore , authors may present the more interesting ( and signiﬁcant ) results in the abstract , but the full text may convey more complete , balanced information . Therefore , we also performed the following evaluation in the articles of Database 1 . We examined for each of the relative risks in - cluded in the respective meta - analyses of prognostic marker studies , whether they were nominally statistically signiﬁcant or not based on the 95 % CI coverage . Then we examined how many of the statistically signiﬁcant ones and how many of the non - signiﬁcant ones were presented in the abstract , else - where in the full text , or nowhere in the primary articles . We also accommodated for the possibility that statistical signiﬁ - cance status for the estimate might have been different in the original article than in the meta - analysis , because meta - analysis further standardise some data . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Eligible articles Database 1 included 340 articles and Database 2 incorporated 1575 articles . The articles had been published in 97 and 343 different journals , respectively ( Appendix ) . With the excep - tion of seven articles in Lancet , ﬁve in New England Journal of Medicine , four in JAMA and one in Nature Medicine , these were specialty journals . The 10 most common venues ( along with the number of articles per database ) were Clinical Can - cer Research ( 24 + 127 = 151 ) , Journal of Clinical Oncology ( 22 + 75 = 97 ) , Cancer ( 27 + 62 = 89 ) , British Journal of Cancer ( 23 + 35 = 58 ) , Anticancer Research ( 8 + 46 = 53 ) , International Journal of Cancer ( 17 + 34 = 51 ) , Cancer Research ( 16 + 20 = 36 ) , Gynecological Oncology ( 0 + 35 = 35 ) , International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology and Physics ( 4 + 31 = 35 ) and Human Pathology ( 10 + 22 = 32 ) . The median journal impact factor was 4 . 1 and 2 . 7 for Databases 1 and 2 , respectively . 3 . 2 . ‘Positive’ prognostic articles ‘Positive’ prognostic articles accounted for 90 . 6 % and 95 . 8 % in the two databases , respectively ( Fig . 1 ) . In the vast majority ( 83 . 6 % and 90 . 4 % , respectively ) , the prognostic association was indicated either with a p - value and / or CI , or by a state - ment containing the word ‘statistical ( ly ) ’ and / or ‘signiﬁ - cant ( ly ) ’ . Only two articles ( both in Database 2 ) implied a possible signiﬁcant prognostic effect in the abstract ( using slightly better or worse language 23 , 24 ) without the effect being conﬁrmed in the full text . For Database 2 , the journal impact factor was signiﬁcantly higher in ‘positive’ than ‘negative’ prognostic articles ( Mann – Whitney p < 0 . 001 ) ; the difference was not signiﬁcant in Data - base 1 ( p = 0 . 17 ) . Overall , among journals with impact factor exceeding 4 , the proportion of ‘positive’ prognostic articles was 92 . 9 % ( 170 / 183 ) and 98 . 1 % ( 565 / 576 ) in Databases 1 and 2 , respectively . Across the 10 journals that were most com - mon venues for the publication of these prognostic studies ( as mentioned in the previous section ) , the rates of ‘positive’ articles varied from 81 . 3 % ( Hum Pathol ) to 100 % ( Cancer Res , Int J Cancer ) for the two databases combined , but these differences were not beyond chance . The proportion of the ‘positive’ articles was higher in Data - base 2 than Database 1 ( p = 0 . 001 ) , whereas the proportion of ‘positive’ articles with a p - value and / or CI was similar ( p = 0 . 39 ) . A total of 274 ( 80 . 6 % ) articles from Database 1 would be retrieved by the search algorithm of Database 2 . Among them , the proportion of ‘positive’ articles was 252 / 274 ( 91 . 9 % ) . The search algorithm did not miss ‘positive’ articles far less than ‘negative’ ones ( p = 0 . 10 ) . The 66 non - retrieved articles were nevertheless all indexed in PubMed .

Over - all , one of the 3 mechanisms was used in 27 articles and 10 of them used more than one of the three mechanisms ( Table 1 ) . Of the 66 ‘negative’ prognostic articles in Database 2 , 23 claimed signiﬁcance for other analyses , 14 expanded on non - signiﬁcant trends , and 26 offered some other apologies . Overall , one of the three mechanisms was used in 45 articles and 16 of them used more than one of the three mechanisms ( Table 1 ) . Only one ‘negative’ article presented some statisti - cally signiﬁcant prognostic effects in the full text that were not shown in the abstract . 25 Of the 19 articles that discussed non - signiﬁcant trends in the two databases , 9 offered p - values , and 1 offered CI . Of the 14 p - values presented in these articles , 10 were between 0 . 05 and 0 . 10 , two were between 0 . 10 and 0 . 20 and two were greater than 0 . 20 . Of the 43 articles that offered apologies , 20 suggested that larger and / or different studies should be conducted , e . g . Fur - ther studies , on other uniform populations , with tumour features different from those described here , are necessary in order to reveal the prognostic signiﬁcance of the molecules discussed 26 or The co - hort examined was relatively small and with larger patient num - bers , MDM2 over - expression may emerge as a more signiﬁcant covariate . 27 Twelve other articles suggested that the marker may have an important role in a different setting or stage , e . g . The absence of statistically signiﬁcant correlations between p53 gene mutations and progressive disease , however , does not exclude its putative relevance in early phases of tumour develop - ment . 28 There was also a large variety of other considerations raised to defend the prognostic marker . Some articles offered quite stretched apologies , commenting on issues not examined in the study or totally irrelevant with its aims ( e . g . HIF - 1 alpha does not appear to predict survival ; however , this study suggests that bioreductive drugs should be investigated in clinical trials of MPM 29 ) ; or referred to previous successes of the team on some other , unrelated marker , e . g . an abstract concluded that These results vary from our previous study on the expression of the differentiation marker cytokeratin 18 , which showed that positive staining of tumour cells was associated with a statistically signiﬁcant poorer prognosis at stage I regardless of histological types . 30 Exact statements of all ‘negative’ articles appear in Appendix . Eventually , there were only ﬁve articles in Database 1 and 21 in Database 2 that were fully ‘negative’ for all presented re - sults in the abstract and without any effort being made to ex - pand on non - signiﬁcant trends or to offer any apologies . These represent 1 . 5 % and 1 . 3 % of the two databases , respectively . 3 . 4 . Presentation in primary articles of the relative risks included in meta - analyses Almost all ( 139 / 151 , 92 . 1 % ) the statistically signiﬁcant relative risks that were included in meta - analyses ( Database 1 ) had appeared in the abstract of the primary studies and with few exceptions ( n = 6 ) they were also shown to be ‘positive’ Table 1 – Further analysis of claims in ‘negative’ prognostic studies Database 1 , N ( % ) Database 2 , N ( % ) Not admitted to be fully ‘negative’ 27 ( 7 . 9 ) 45 ( 2 . 8 ) Signiﬁcance for other ( non - prognostic ) analyses 6 ( 1 . 7 ) 11 ( 0 . 6 ) Discussion of non - signiﬁcant trends 2 ( 0 . 6 ) 5 ( 0 . 3 ) Offered apologies 9 ( 2 . 8 ) 13 ( 0 . 8 ) Signiﬁcance for other analyses + discussion of non - signiﬁcant trends 1 ( 0 . 3 ) 3 ( 0 . 2 ) Signiﬁcance for other analyses + offered apologies 6 ( 1 . 7 ) 7 ( 0 . 5 ) Discussion of non - signiﬁcant trends + offered apologies 3 ( 0 . 8 ) 4 ( 0 . 3 ) All three mechanisms – 2 ( 0 . 1 ) Admitted to be fully ‘negative’ 5 ( 1 . 5 ) 21 ( 1 . 3 ) Table 2 – Comparison of prognostic effect included in the meta - analysis with the effect presented by the primary studies ( Database 1 ) Signiﬁcant effects in meta - analysis N = 151 ( 39 . 7 % ) Non - signiﬁcant effects in meta - analysis N = 229 ( 60 . 3 % ) Presented in abstract 139 ( 36 . 6 ) 167 ( 43 . 9 % ) Signiﬁcant in the abstract a 133 ( 35 % ) 49 ( 12 . 9 % ) Non - signiﬁcant in the abstract 6 ( 1 . 6 % ) 118 ( 31 % ) Presented in full article ( not abstract ) 10 ( 2 . 6 % ) 48 ( 12 . 7 % ) Signiﬁcant in the full article b 7 ( 1 . 8 % ) 6 ( 1 . 6 % ) Non - signiﬁcant in the full article 3 ( 0 . 6 % ) 42 ( 11 . 1 % ) Not presented even in full article 2 ( 0 . 5 % ) 14 ( 3 . 7 % ) a Based on p - value , CI , or implied language conﬁrmed in the full text . b Based on p - value or CI . 2562 EU RO PEA N J OURNAL OF CANCE R 4 3 ( 2 0 07 ) 2 55 9 – 2 57 9 in the abstract ( Table 2 ) . Conversely , only half ( 118 / 229 , 51 . 5 % ) of the non - statistically signiﬁcant relative risks that were in - cluded in the meta - analyses had been presented as ‘negative’ in the abstract ; in fact , a sizeable proportion of the non - statis - tically signiﬁcant risks had been presented as ‘positive’ in the primary studies ( 55 / 229 , 24 % ) , even in their abstracts ( 49 / 229 , 21 . 4 % ) , but the numbers entered in the meta - analysis showed them as ‘negative’ . This is because the primary studies had selectively highlighted analyses based on different follow - up , deﬁnitions of marker positivity , and / or adjustments ( or lack thereof ) for other variables compared to what the meta - analyses tried to standardise . Overall , only 39 . 7 % ( 151 / 380 ) of the relative risks that were included in meta - analyses were statistically signiﬁcant . How - ever , when we considered the full text of primary papers , 53 . 6 % ( 195 / 364 ) were shown as positive and when we consid - ered the abstracts 59 . 5 % ( 182 / 306 ) were shown as ‘positive’ ( Table 2 ) . Sixteen relative risks that were used by the meta - analyses were not presented at the full primary articles and 14 of them were non - statistically signiﬁcant . 4 . Discussion This survey shows that articles on cancer prognostic markers almost ubiquitously highlight signiﬁcant prognostic associa - tions . In the rare articles where no prognostic markers are presented as signiﬁcant , authors often have other ( non - prog - nostic ) statistically signiﬁcant analyses to show , they expand on the importance of non - signiﬁcant trends , or defend the importance of the cancer marker with other arguments . Eventually , totally ‘negative’ articles on prognostic cancer markers represent less than 1 . 5 % of this literature that is served by a wide variety of journals . The selection for publication of ‘positive’ studies has been observed in other experimental designs as well , including ran - domised controlled trials , 13 , 14 and epidemiological studies . 31 Forprognosticstudiesthesituationmaybeevenmoreextreme . Apparently , apublishableunitshouldincludeatleastonepiece of statistically signiﬁcant information . Even the few ‘negative’ articles rarely ever conclude that the tested marker simply has no prognostic effect and is not important to pursue further . While new candidate markers emerge continuously , none seems to be abandoned based on what this literature says . These empirical observations probably indicate a research culture that is driven by the pursuit of statistical signiﬁcance . However , the meaning of signiﬁcant p - values is probably widely misunderstood . 17 , 32 Currently , nominal signiﬁcance at the p = 0 . 05 threshold should not necessarily offer high credi - bility to a proposed prognostic effect . 33 Given the rapid evolu - tion of molecular medicine , an enormous number of potential prognostic markers can be tested promptly in the same , usu - allylimited , 10 , 19 sampleofpatients . Takingintoaccountallthis extreme multiplicity of analyses is very difﬁcult , if not impos - sible , as one would have to account not only for the analyses reported in a single paper , but also for unreported analyses , analyses performed on the same sample in other articles and on other samples on the same associations . At stark contrast to a literature that is replete with claims of statistical signiﬁ - cance , only a tiny fraction of the initially proposed ‘signiﬁcant’ prognostic markers have found a clinical application . 1 , 4 , 5 , 19 Some caveats should be acknowledged . First , the Abstract is the face of an article and may be selectively highlighting the more interesting ( and signiﬁcant ) results , but the full text may convey more complete , balanced information . We did not focus on counting the presence of all ‘negative’ results in the abstracts of these articles . Approximately , half of the non - sta - tistically signiﬁcant relative risks included in prognostic mar - ker meta - analyses were not presented as ‘negative’ in the abstract of the primary articles . Thus , it would make no sense to try to count ‘negative’ results in these abstracts . Instead , we tried to see whether ‘negative’ prognostic effects from meta - analyses had appeared in the primary articles and if so , where and how . We found that a quarter of the non - statistically sig - niﬁcant relative risks included in prognostic marker meta - analyses were actually presented as ‘positive’ in the primary studies . The opposite scenario was very rare . The reason is that for prognostic makers there is a wide variety of different exploratory analyses that can be performed , by shifting the deﬁnition of outcome , performing analyses at different dura - tions of follow - up , playing with the cut - off deﬁnition of mar - ker positivity , and adjusting or not for various combinations of other markers and covariates . Statistical signiﬁcance may be claimed for some select mode of analysis and this may be reported and highlighted . Then the meta - analysis tries to standardise deﬁnitions and analyses . In the absence of selec - tive reporting of analyses and outcomes , standardization should have caused the same number of ‘positive’ results to become ‘negative’ versus the opposite transition . With this perspective , one might claim that deﬁnitive eval - uation of the prognostic effects should await the conduct of proper meta - analyses . Unfortunately , meta - analyses are not exempt from these biases and they may even magnify them . Performing meta - analyses in an environment of strong selec - tive reporting may simply lead to spurious precision of the summary estimates . 34 Most prognostic meta - analyses cannot achieve full standardization of the data . 9 Most past meta - anal - yses have not communicatedwith the primary investigators , 35 and even those that have , have not been able to retrieve stan - dardised data for most studies . 9 Moreover , in our experience , 9 inclusion of a few sets of unpublished data can totally elimi - nate the statistical signiﬁcance of prognostic effects based on the published literature . Selecting the studies based on their apparent quality of design and conduct is also not infor - mative , since reporting of these articles 19 is suboptimal and reported quality does not seem to correlate with effect sizes . 10 Articles that did not report or imply prognostic effects in the abstract were excluded from Database 2 . These articles might have some prognostic associations hidden in the full text and this information might have been ‘negative’ . How - ever , in an effort to retrieve the Database 1 articles using the Database 2 algorithm , we found no strong evidence for such a differential retrieval bias against ‘negative’ articles . Small bias would not affect the conclusion that most of this prognostic literature is ‘positive’ . We should also acknowledge that one cannot tell what is the expected proportion of prognostic results that should be ‘positive’ , if no bias exists in the conduct and reporting of these studies . It is conceivable that for many prognostic investigations , researchers pick their targets based on some prior evidence , and therefore , one would expect that the E UROPE AN JOU RNAL O F CAN CER 4 3 ( 20 0 7 ) 2 5 59 – 2 5 7 9 2563 proportion of nominally statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings should be much higher than the 5 % expected by chance . How - ever , the almost ubiquitous presence of ‘positive’ studies seems to be too excessive even under very optimistic assump - tions about the ability of investigators to select important tar - gets for prognostic studies . The results of the current study may lead to some recom - mendations on how to improve this situation . The recently proposed REMARK consensus 19 is a step forward for the stan - dardization of the reporting of cancer prognostic marker stud - ies . The authors should avoid highlighting only the signiﬁcant associations and they should try to present or at least alert readers to all of the examined associations and all the differ - ent deﬁnitions of outcomes , markers , and covariates that they did consider a priori versus post hoc . Additionally , journals should encourage the publication of well designed , executed and reported prognostic marker studies , regardless of the ‘sig - niﬁcant’ or ‘non - signiﬁcant’ ﬁndings . The development of col - laborations and networks between investigators may be beneﬁcial , if such networks focus also on minimising selective reporting and publication bias . 36 , 37 Transparency and public availability of protocols , data , analyses and results would also help . 36 – 38 Some ﬁelds , such as molecular proﬁling with micro - arrays , have made important progress in this regard . 39 In the meanwhile , readers should also be advised to interpret cau - tiously the postulated prognostic associations . While we lim - ited our survey to cancer , the most proliﬁc ﬁeld of prognostic markers , similar considerations may apply also to prognostic markers in other ﬁelds across medicine . Given the potential clinical importance of prognostic information , rigorous efforts to improve the design and reporting of these studies are war - ranted . At a different level , the community of researchers is dependent also on funding groups . Funding groups should also realise that investigators should not be supported primar - ily for their ability to produce statistically signiﬁcant results , but they should reward novel ideas , rigorous design , imple - mentation and transparent reporting of results , regardless of their statistical signiﬁcance . Perhaps there should be also dis - incentives for investigators and teams that report exclusively only statistically signiﬁcant results in their careers .

On the other hand obesity might be related to improved survival in a screened population , because obese patients proﬁt more from screening by earlier detection of tumours than leaner counterparts 2 , 3 Dunphy / 1997 / Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg – – 2564 EU RO PEA N J OURNAL OF CANCE R 4 3 ( 2 0 07 ) 2 55 9 – 2 57 9 Table 3 – continued Author / Year / Journal Statement Type of statement Frank / 1994 / Cancer Patients whose tumours stained strongly for p53 were signiﬁcantly younger , presented at a more advanced clinical disease stage , and tended to have increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( p = 0 . 056 ) 1 , 2 Fridman / 2000 / Virchows Arch – – Galanis / 1998 / Int J Oncol Oncogene ampliﬁcation events were signiﬁcantly more frequent in grade 4 than in grade 3 astrocytomas , mixed gliomas or oligodendrogliomas ( p < 0 . 001 ) .

While it was found that over - expression of p53 was signiﬁcantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis ( p = 0 . 006 ) , there was no association between the expression of c - erbB - 2 and lymph node status 1 Keohavong / 1996 / Clin Cancer Res However , the substitution of the wild - type GGT ( glycine ) at codon 12 with a GTT ( valine ) or a CGT ( arginine ) showed a strong trend ( p = 0 . 07 ) towards a poorer prognosis compared with wild - type or other amino acid substitutions . Substitution of the wild - type glycine for aspartate ( GAT ) showed a strong trend ( p = 0 . 06 ) for a better outcome than the valine or arginine substitution . Although these trends will require larger patient populations for veriﬁcation , these data suggest that the prognostic signiﬁcance of K - ras mutations may depend on the amino acid substitution in the p21 ( ras ) protein 2 , 3 McLaren / 1992 / Br J Cancer This indicates that although p53 may be of considerable importance in the initiation of malignancy it is probably of little signiﬁcance once a tumour has developed 3 Molino / 1999 / Breast Cancer Res Treat No signiﬁcant association was found between bone marrow evolution and relapse or death , but the relatively high probability of a change in status over time cannot exclude the possibility that a positive aspirate during the course of breast cancer may be a negative prognostic factor 3 Nadal / 1995 / J Pathol These ﬁndings indicate that p53 may play a role in an early stage of malignant transformation of a subset of squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx , but seems not to be associated with further progression of the tumours 3 O’Neill / 1996 / Histopathology There was a signiﬁcant linear correlation between apoptotic indices and mitotic indices . bcl - 2 over - expression and p53 over - expression were not associated with attenuated apoptosis , or altered mitotic or Ki - 67 labelling indices in either tumour type . . .

Patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who harbour a ras mutation may have major responses to chemotherapy and have similar progression - free and overall survival as patients with ras mutation - negative tumours .

We observed that Arg / Arg homozygotes were frequently found in non - smoking patients with NSCLC but Arg / Pro heterozygotes were infrequent in the group . . . Thus , the polymorphism of the p53 gene affects the predisposition of non - smokers to NSCLC , but the alteration of the p53 gene is independent of tumour progression and histopathology 3 Wang / 1998 / J Cancer Res Clin Oncol All mutations occurred in male patients who were smokers . . .
