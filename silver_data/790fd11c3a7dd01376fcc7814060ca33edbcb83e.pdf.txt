Single of the bead with nanometer accuracy ( Finer et al . , 1994 ) . IndividualATPase reactions ofsingleone - headed actin filaments and cofilaments consisting of one - headed myosin and myosin rod fluorescently labeled myosin molecules were measured by directly observing association - dissociation events of a fluorescent ATP with a red fluorescent dye Cy5 were observed under epifluorescence optics equipped with a He - Ne laser and analog labeled with Cy3 ( Funatsu et al . , 1995 ) . The fluo - rescence was excited by the evanescent wave gener - a high sensitivity IISIT camera . Both ends of a single actin filament , approximately 15 (cid:109) m long , were attached ated by total internal reflection of a green laser ( 532 nm , 2 mW ) ( Figure 1 ) . The laser beam was incident on the to beads via the biotin - avidin system , and the actin fila - ment wascapturedandsuspended insolutionbymanip - interfacebetweena fusedsilica coverslip ( highreflective index ) and the aqueous solution ( low reflective index ) ulating the beads with dual optical tweezers generated by an infrared YAG laser ( 600 mW in max . ) .

This produced an evanescent field with a 1 / e pended actin filament was brought into contact with a single one - headed myosin molecule in a myosin - rod penetrationdepthofapproximately150nm intothe solu - tion . The local illumination by the evanescent field cofilament bound to the surface of a rectangular pedes - tal approximately 7 (cid:109) m wide and approximately 1 (cid:109) m greatly reduced the background luminescence so that it was at least 2000 - fold lower than that of conventional high , which had been formed on a glass surface by chemical etching . epifluorescence microscopy and allowed single fluoro - phores to be clearly observed ( Funatsu et al . , 1995 ) . The force and displacement caused by the myosin head were determined by measuring the displacement To measure the steps in the ATPase reaction , 10 – 20 Chemomechanical Coupling in a Myosin Motor 163 nM Cy3 - ATP was applied to myosin on the surface . cofilament at a time ( Figure 1A , refer to Figure 4 ) .

However , as the affinity of myosin for ATP and 100 nM Cy3 - ATP , respectively . Similar dis - ATP ( (cid:122) 10 11 M - 1 ) is much greater than that of ADP placements were observed for the two nucleotides . The ( (cid:122) 10 6 M - 1 ) ( Woledge et al , 1985 ; Goldman and Brenner lower traces in Figures 2B and 2C show changes in the 1987 ) , the association - dissociationevents ofCy3 - nucle - stiffness due to actin – myosin interactions , determined otide should correspond to the individual ATP turnover by measuring the variance of the bead position due to events .

Therefore , the ATPturnover bound to the actin filament , the total stiffness of the events can be detected by observing the association - system ( including the trapped bead and the actomyosin dissociation events of Cy3 - nucleotide .

The change in stiffness is an indicator used for localizing bound nucleotides and measuring of the interaction between the actin filament and the their fluorescence intensity , respectively . myosin head ( Molloy et al . , 1995 ) . Figure 3A shows a histogram ( red bars ) of the dis - placements in the presence of ATP , which have been Displacements in the Presence of ATP and Cy3 - ATP scored using the increase in stiffness as the criterion for an actomyosin interaction . The displacements had We tested whether force and displacement could be produced by myosin in the presence of Cy3 - ATP as well a relatively broad distribution , which can be explained by the randomizing effect of the Brownian motions of asin the presenceofATP .

In the absence of acto - myosin interaction , optically trapped beads underwent plify the assay , we have used one - headed myosin mole - cules prepared by papain digestion of skeletal muscle large thermal vibrations around the equilibrium position ( i . e . , at zero displacement ) . Therefore , if a myosin head myosin .

In many previous in and produced , for example , an active displacement of 20 nm , the observed displacement would be ( 20 (cid:49) 30 ) vitro motility models , individual mechanical events were measured from myosin subfragments , which were ran - nm (cid:53) (cid:49) 50 nm . Conversely , if attachment occurredwhen the bead thermally moved to (cid:50) 30 nm , the observed domly bound to an artificial surface ( Finer et al . , 1994 ; Miyata et al . , 1994 ; Molloy , et al . , 1995 ; Guilford et al . , displacement would be (cid:50) 10 nm . Thus , the spread of the distribution can be explained by Brownian motions 1997 ) . The forces and displacements , however , strongly depend on the angle between the myosin and actin and the position of the center of the distribution giving the displacement produced by the myosin head ( Molloy filaments ( Ishijima et al . , 1994 ; Tanaka et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , to avoid effects of random orientation , we et al . , 1995 ) . The displacement value determined from the center positions of the distributions ( Figure 3A , red have measured the forces and displacements from sin - gle one - headed myosin molecules sparsely distributed bars ) was 15 nm , which was similar to that obtained in the presence of Cy3 - ATP ( 12 nm , Figure 3B , red bars ) . in filaments copolymerized from one - headed myosin and headless myosin rods .

Thus , the actinfilament inter - acted with a single one - headed myosin molecule in the of ATP . Cell164 Figure 3 .

Chemomechanical Coupling in a Myosin Motor 165 decrease in the fluorescence intensity ( bottom trace ) are due to association and dissociation , respectively , of single Cy3 - nucleotides with the myosin head . The return to zero displacement and the decrease in stiff - ness ( i . e . , dissociation of actomyosin rigor complexes ) were associated with increases in the fluorescence in - tensity ( i . e . , association of Cy3 - ATPto the myosin head ) . Changes in the displacement and increases in the stiff - ness ( i . e . , association of a myosin head with actin ) were accompanied bydecreases in the fluorescenceintensity ( i . e . , dissociation of Cy3 - nucleotide , presumably Cy3 - ADP ) . Thus , we have directly detected the coupling be - tween individual mechanical events and ATPase reac - tions at the single molecule level . At 10 – 20 nM Cy3 - ATP , displacements driven by the hydrolysis of Cy3 - ATP , were maintained for tens of sec - onds until a newCy3 - ATP molecule boundto the myosin head . The displacement and the stiffness decreased upon binding of a new Cy3 - ATP to the myosin head , which was due to the detachment of the myosin head from the actin filament . Figure 6A shows the displace - ment ( upper trace ) , the change in the stiffness ( middle trace ) , and the change in the fluorescence intensity due to Cy3 - nucleotide binding to the myosin head ( bottom trace ) on an expanded time scale . When a Cy3 - ATP nucleotide bound , the myosin head rapidly detached from actin . The spread of timings between the Cy3 - ATP binding and the detachment of the myosin head was Figure 4 .

Thus , our results tions have supported this assumption , but there has show that the force can be generated several hundred been no definite evidence to support this ( Bagshaw and milliseconds after the release of bound nucleotide from Trentham , 1974 ; Woledge et al . , 1985 ; Goldman , 1987 ; the myosin head .

Therefore , the possibility cannot be The following kinetic scheme is consistent with our completely excluded that the force generation may be findings : coupled to the release of Pi . The present technique could be extended to study other allosteric enzymes , such as GTP - binding cell sig - naling proteins , to examine if high energy states or sig - nals can be retained after ligand changes . This hystere - sis or memory effect may be a common characteristic of the protein molecules and important for regulation of complex kinetic pathways in which many enzymes or From a thermodynamic viewpoint , as the free energy signaling proteins are involved cooperatively . level of the A (cid:49) M state is higher than that of AM , it is possible that the myosin head can produce force when Experimental Procedures it binds to actin in the absence of ATP ( Eisenberg et al . , 1980 ; Geeves et al . , 1984 ) . In this case , ATP would be Preparation of Proteins used for dissociation of the myosin head from actin . Myosinandactin wereobtained fromrabbit skeletalmuscle .
