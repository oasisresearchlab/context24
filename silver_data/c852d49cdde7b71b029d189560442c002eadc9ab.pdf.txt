Repeated , molecularly clean separations of the template from the newly cured resist is a requirement , yet rather little is understood about the separation process or underlying interfacial physics and chemistry . We have investigated the chemical and physical interactions of several model acrylate nanoimprint resist formulations cured in contact with clean and release - treated quartz surfaces , then separated from them . The results show that fracture energies are resist formulation - dependent , that the resist - release layer systems studied are not chemically stable and that release process is more complex than simple fracture at a glass - organic interface . 1 . INTRODUCTION Separation of the template from a newly UV - crosslinked lithographic stencil is a critical process in nanoimprint lithography 1 : if the surfaces adhere too strongly portions of the polymeric film or potentially the glass template can be broken off , resulting in significant defects and damage . 2 , 3 Near - surface cohesive failure can also occur , causing changes in the surface compositions without formation of regions of visible material transfer . 4 It has been found that application of a fluorinated release layer to the template can facilitate template removal , and significant effort has been made to optimize the quality of this layer 5 - 8 and to identify alternative template materials that can reduce adhesion . 9 The guiding idea is that a fully fluorinated surface is the lowest energy possible state , thus minimizing driving forces for chemical and physical interactions that could lead to strong adhesion with the resist . Nonetheless , it has been noted in the literature that even the best layer is not perfectly effective or very durable . 3 , 9 - 11 In this work we investigate the nature of the interactions between resist and template materials in order to identify possible reasons for the degradation of applied release layers during imprint . We have studied three distinct acrylate resist formulations cured in contact with clean and release - coated unpatterned silica flats . The resist formulations were chosen for their chemical differences , not for their imprinting characteristics . We have measured interfacial adhesion energies , x - ray photoemission , contact angle , ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy of film surfaces to gain insight to the interactions between these materials and assess the nature of the separation process . The data show the release layer - resist system is far from inert , pointing to the need for a sophisticated approach to materials reliability in nanoimprint technology . 2 . EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 2 . 1 Materials Three resist formulations are used to probe behaviors with composition . All three use Darocur 4265 ( Ciba - Geigy ) as UV - sensitizers to initiate free radical polymerization .

Resist CA is crosslinker - rich , relatively hydrophilic and has a high Tg . It comprises 48 . 5 % t - butyl acrylate ( Aldrich ) and 48 . 5 % 1 , 3 butanediol diacrylate ( Aldrich ) , and 3 % Darocur . 12 Resist SiA is intermediate in properties between OA and CA . It contains Si and is composed of 44 % ( 3 - acryloxypropyl ) tris ( trimethylsiloxy ) silane ( Gelest ) , 37 % t - butyl acrylate , 15 % 1 , 3 butanediol diacrylate and 4 % Darocur . 11 , 13 All resist components were used without further purification . The cured resist materials did not adhere to clean native oxide covered silicon so an adhesion promoter was used to pretreat the wafers . An 8 . 4 x 10 - 4 molar solution of o - ( vinyloxybutyl ) - n - ( triethoxysilylpropyl ) urethane ( Gelest ) in toluene was found to form a high quality film 1 . 5 - 2 nm in thickness by ellipsometry with a water contact angle of 47º . Fluorosyl FSD 4500 ( Cytonix ) was used to form a 2 nm thick release layer on glass surfaces . The formulation contains 0 . 6 % of a high molecular weight fluorinated disilane in a fluorinated solvent . Films cast from this product have surface energies ranging from 17 - 21 dynes / cm ( according to manufacturer ) , with water contact angles measured by us of 113º . The substrates used in this study are ( 100 ) silicon wafers , either 25 . 4mm rounds or 12 . 3mm x 65mm bars . Unpatterned fused silica 25 . 4mm round wafers or Corning 0211 glass bars ( 12 . 3mm x 65mm ) were used as UV - transparent covers . Bar specimens were used for adhesion measurements , with subsequent characterization of the exposed surfaces . Round substrates were used for various control studies . Since the glass flatness was not high rather thick ( 5 micron ) resist layers were applied for curing to ensure contact between resist and top and bottom wafers everywhere . 2 . 2 Sample preparation Glass and silicon wafers and bars were cleaned using acetone followed by immersion in a sulfuric acid – oxidizer bath , rinsing with DI water and degreasing in isopropyl alcohol vapor . Immediately prior to use adventitious organics were removed by a UV - ozone treatment ( Jelight Corporation ) for 30 - 60 minutes . Subsequent X - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( XPS ) measurements showed the surface carbon reduced to below 1 % . Water contact angles of less than 4 degrees were obtained . The adhesion promoter was applied to silicon by placing a puddle on the wafer , allowing it to rest in a covered basin for 45 s and spinning it dry at 3000 rpm for 60 s . The coated wafers were used immediately . The release layer was applied to freshly cleaned glass by immersing the substrates in a small bath of the undiluted Fluorosyl FSD 4500 solution for 2 minutes , then in a second bath of Novec Engineered Fluid HFE 7100 ( a fluorinated solvent from 3M ) for 2 minutes . Fresh baths were used for each wafer to ensure consistent coating conditions . The substrates were placed on a hot plate held at 110 ºC for 20 minutes to drive off solvent and promote binding of the silane groups to the surface hydroxyl groups . 14 Release layers prepared in this manner were also applied to native oxide covered silicon for characterization by ellipsometry and AFM . They were found to have thicknesses between 1 - 3 nm , a peak - to - valley roughness of 2 - 3 nm and an rms roughness of 0 . 5 nm . 6 microliters of resist were applied to the silicon substrates , immediately covered with the matching glass and exposed to UV . All sample handling was in normal laboratory air with a humidity level from 40 - 60 % . All exposures were made with an unfiltered OAI UV lamp with output centered at 365nm . The intensity was measured to be 35 mW / cm 2 . Exposure times were set to 30 s to ensure complete cure . No attempt was made to exclude oxygen , which inhibits cure until fully consumed . 15 2 . 3 Double cantilever beam measurements Adhesion energies were measured using a DTS Delaminator in double cantilever beam ( DCB ) mode in ambient laboratory air ( typically 40 - 60 % humidity ) . Separation rates were fixed at 2 microns / sec . Force vs separation data were analyzed to obtain energy release rates using beam theory . 4 2 . 4 Surface and thin film characterization Relative hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity were measured by DI water contact angles using a VCA 2500XE instrument . Initial ( spreading ) contact angles were measured with a 1 microliter drop volume in several locations on each sample , and averaged to obtain the values reported . Proc . of SPIE Vol . 6153 61531B - 2 Release and adhesion layer film thicknesses were measured using a Woollam M - 2000V spectroscopic ellipsometer . Release layer films were characterized on native - oxide covered , UV - ozone cleaned silicon wafers to facilitate the sensitivity of the measurements . These are expected to be chemically similar to the silica surfaces actually used . X - ray photoemission data were obtained using a Physical Electronics Quantum 2000 Scanning Microprobe spectrometer . Data obtained are averages of determinations at several locations on the samples . Compositions were obtained from surface measurements using standard sensitivities . Examinations of surfaces after varying delays showed them to be compositionally stable in air following any changes incurred immediately after separation at the resist - glass interface . Atomic force microscope ( AFM ) images were obtained using a Digital Instruments D5000 in tapping mode . It was found that the best images were obtained for phase and topography using soft cantilevers ( 75 and 200 kHz ) . The spatial resolution was set to 4 nm per pixel . 3 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3 . 1 Adhesion DCB measurements show that the adhesion between the resist and release - treated or clean SiO 2 varies significantly with resist chemistry . Data are presented in Figure 1 . Figure 1 : Energy release rates measured by DCB for 3 resist systems with release - treated or untreated SiO 2 . The fracture energy of a resist - release coating interface ranges from 0 . 4 to 1 . 6 J / m 2 for these materials , while that for a resist - glass interface spans 0 . 9 to 3 . 5 J / m 2 . It is clear that the release layer’s properties , particularly its low surface energy , do not control the fracture process , rather it is the characteristic of the interface with the cured resist that is important . Contact angles of surfaces with selected liquids provides information on surface energies . 16 It has been assumed that the successful function of a release layer is connected with its low surface energy , that is , its physical stability . The water contact angle of the release layer used in this work is initially 113º . As shown in Table 1 , this value does not change very much after separation from the newly cured resist . In all cases the resist becomes more hydrophobic when cured in contact with the fluorosilane layer , as expected . There is no correlation , however , between contact angle values for the release layer or resist - glass ( coated or uncoated ) pairs and the measured adhesion energies . This indicates that surface energies alone do not control the fracture process . 0 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 6 . 0 0 20 40 60 Crack Length , a ( mm ) F r ac t u r e E n e r g y , G c ( J COA1 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 0 20 40 60 Crack Length , a ( mm ) F r ac t u r e E n e r g y , G c ( J / m 2 ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Crack Length , a ( mm ) F r ac t u r e E n e r g y , G c ( J / m 2 ) OA SiA no release release no release no release release release CA 0 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 6 . 0 0 20 40 60 Crack Length , a ( mm ) F r ac t u r e E n e r g y , G c ( J COA1 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 2 . 5 0 20 40 60 Crack Length , a ( mm ) F r ac t u r e E n e r g y , G c ( J / m 2 ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Crack Length , a ( mm ) F r ac t u r e E n e r g y , G c ( J / m 2 ) OA SiA no release release no release no release release release CA Proc . of SPIE Vol . 6153 61531B - 3 Table 1 .

The XPS composition data are shown in Tables 2 and 3 . As - deposited release layer data are shown as a range because the fluorosilane coverage varies over this range despite the use of consistent fabrication processes .

There is not a corresponding increase in F concentration on the surface of the cured resists , however , suggesting that F - containing products may be released as volatiles rather than transferred as intact fluorosilanes to the resist surface . Using Si concentration as a marker for release layer integrity in the CA system , an increase in Si relative to C after separation suggests thinning of the layer or enlargement of small pinholes during cure . This is consistent with the C and F loss from the release layer for this resist . In the case of OA and SiA resists , on the other hand , the Si concentration change is much less . Table 4 shows that for all three resists there is a significant increase in O concentration in the release layer , indicating that at some time during the curing or separation process the release layer is oxidized . Finally , there is a significant increase in the C concentration on untreated glass after cure , with a significantly larger C concentration change for OA compared to CA and SiA . Figure 2 : C region XPS data for resists cured with and without release layer contact . Examination of the high resolution carbon spectra show the chemical composition of the release layer is quite complex and undergoes changes even when F loss is minor , as found for OA resist . Data are shown in Figure 2 . The increased intensity of the C , O region is consistent with an oxidative process during cure . 310 305 300 295 290 285 280 275 CF , O ( CF 2 ) x C , O C - C , H SiA resist , glass side C region release layer after cure release layer ( unused ) material on glass after cure , no release treatment i n t en s i t y , a r b un i t s binding energy ( eV ) 310 305 300 295 290 285 280 275 CA resist , glass side C region release layer after cure material on glass after cure , no release treatment release layer ( unused ) CF , O ( CF 2 ) x C , O C - C , H i n t en s i t y , a r b un i t s binding energy ( eV ) Proc . of SPIE Vol . 6153 61531B - 5 : . . 4 - — . a The composition and contact angle data reported here are consistent with earlier studies on chemically related systems ( acrylates and fluorosilanes ) . Direct measurements of the F concentration on tridecafluoro - 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 - tetrahydrooctyltrichlorosilane ( FOTS ) - covered glass shows F loss with number of imprints , 11 while another report from the same group showed minimal accompanying contact angle changes , 3 indicating that the FOTS layer can undergo chemical changes without dramatically affecting its surface energy . The fracture energies obtained in this work differ significantly from previous work , however . A value of 0 . 02 J / m 2 was estimated for an FOTS release layer , under the assumption that the surface energy controls fracture . 6 The data presented here show that this assumption is too simple , however , and it is not known whether such a low fracture energy could actually be achieved . A double cantilever beam measurement of adhesion of an FOTS - like layer , Aquaphobe ( Gelest ) , to a cured diacrylate - based resist gave a value of 2 . 8 J / m 2 . 10 This result is not inconsistent with the present results , which show that considerable variation in adhesion can be expected depending on the materials system , but cannot yet be directly compared to them . Curing in contact with the release layer does not just affect the interfacial chemistry . The AFM images of cured materials shown in Figure 3 provide clear evidence that the presence of the release layer affects the morphology of the cured material . A recent study of buried interface morphologies of polymerized organics showed structures not unlike those observed in this work . 17 The mechanism of resist surface texture formation and its importance in adhesive behaviors requires further investigation . 200nm 200nm 200nm without release with release CA 200nm OA 200nm 200nm SiA 200nm 200nm 200nm without release with release CA 200nm OA 200nm 200nm SiA Figure 3 : AFM images of cured resist topography .

Curing in contact with a release layer produces significant topography for resists CA and SiA ( roughness of 3 nm rms with large local fissure and pit depths ) .

CONCLUSIONS Adhesion and chemical analyses of cured and separated acrylate resist – glass ( clean and release - treated ) systems reveal some of the microscopics of template - resist interactions during cure . The release energies differed significantly among the three resist formulations , as did the surface contact angles , indicating that the macroscopic release layer surface energy does not govern the release process . It is evident from the data that the release layer used in this work is not inert to the resists . All three of the resists showed evidence for chemical interactions with the release layer , with those for resist CA being so strong that the adhesion to the release layer was higher than to clean glass . F loss from the release layer occurs to varying extents for the three resists , with little or no F transfer to the resist surface , suggesting that it is removed in the form of volatiles . Significant oxidation of the release layer was observed for all three resists . When a clean glass is used the resist undergoes cohesive failure near its surface , resulting in deposits of carbon and oxygen - containing material on the glass . The connection between observable defect formation and these kinds of interactions remains to be established , however the data suggest that it cannot necessarily be assumed that constant defect levels are a sign of stable template surfaces . 3 This study raises a number of important and interesting fundamental questions concerning the interfacial chemistry and physics involved in the nanoimprint process . Mechanical characterization of the cured resists and expanded adhesion measurements focusing on release kinetics and the role of processing and environment are in progress . The data provide an indication that some of the resist components are intrinsically active toward the release layer and studies to elucidate the chemistry involved are underway . 5 .
