The regulation of their activity has been described by a hierarchical model in which elements of Hippo pathway are under the control of focal adhesions ( FAs ) . Here we unveil the molecular mechanism by which cell spreading and RhoA GTPase activity control FA formation through YAP to stabilize the anchorage of the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane . This mechanism requires YAP co - transcriptional function and involves the activation of genes encoding for integrins and FA docking proteins . Tuning YAP transcriptional activity leads to the modiﬁcation of cell mechanics , force development and adhesion strength , and determines cell shape , migration and differentiation . These results provide new insights into the mechanism of YAP mechanosensing activity and qualify this Hippo effector as the key determinant of cell mechanics in response to ECM cues .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 15321 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 C ells are in constant isometric tension with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , an equilibrium of forces needed to ensure to adopt the shape and volume suited to exert their function 1 , 2 . On a larger scale , this condition keeps organ functionality , while changes in the mechanical balance between the cells and the surrounding milieu result in tissue malfunctioning or malignant transformation 3 , 4 . The ability of cells to perceive ECM mechanics and spread is associated to Hippo pathway effectors Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) and WW domain - containing transcription regulator protein 1 ( WWTR1 or TAZ ) shuttling to the nucleus to exert their co - transcriptional activity 5 , 6 . By binding to cell - and context - speciﬁc transcription factors , YAP / TAZ contribute to ECM remodelling 7 – 9 . Focal adhesions ( FAs ) , the main hub for cell mechanosensing , act as a bridge between integrin - ECM connection and the cytoskeleton 10 . Changes in the signals propagated through FAs have been reported in malignant cells and are essential for tumour cell spreading 11 . YAP / TAZ nuclear activity is correlated to the stability of actin cytoskeleton and cell tension , as controlled by myosin light chain II and Rho GTPase pathways 12 – 14 . Integrin - FA signalling has been recently suggested to control Hippo pathway by phosphorylating large tumour suppressor ( LATS ) kinases through Src 15 . These results predicted a hierarchical mechanism by which Hippo effectors behave as downstream sensors of ECM mechanics through integrin - FA signalling and by perceiving cytoskeleton stability . Here we describe the molecular basis of the crosstalk among the different cell mechanosensing systems and propose a model by which YAP directly regulates FA assembly and cell mechanics . Results Cell area controls YAP shuttling regardless of FA assembly . Considering recent evidence suggests possible interplay between Hippo pathway and FAs 15 – 17 , we investigated the correlation between YAP nuclear localization and the presence of FAs . To this end , we cultured adipose tissue - derived mesenchymal stem cells ( AD - MSCs ) onto ﬁbronectin ( FN ) - coated elastically supported surfaces of different stiffness ( 28 and 1 . 5 kPa ) or onto glass surfaces coated either with FN or poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) . FN coating onto the stiff surface ( 28 kPa ) promotes FA assembly , whereas the exposure of cells to PLL abrogates FA formation regardless of substrate stiffness . In addition , FN is not able to foster FA arrangement on soft ( 1 . 5 kPa ) surfaces . Interestingly , in all the conditions in which FA formation was prevented ( PLL or soft surfaces ) , YAP was excluded from the nucleus and cell area was signiﬁcantly reduced as compared with the controls , consistent with the absence of FAs in the cell 18 ( n ¼ 10 , 3 technical replicates , Mann – Whitney test , * * * * P o 0 . 0001 and * * P o 0 , 001 ; Fig . 1a ) . Remarkably , when single cell area was controlled by growing AD - MSCs onto FN - coated micropatterns forcing the cell to acquire given sizes ( 300 , 1 , 024 , 2 , 025 and 10 , 000 m m 2 ) , YAP nuclear expression correlated with the presence of vinculin spikes . In fact , both YAP nucleus / cytoplasm ratio and the number of FAs increased steadily with the size of the cell . Moreover , the expression of FA genes vinculin ( VCL ) , zyxin ( ZYX ) , talin 1 ( TLN1 ) and talin 2 ( TLN2 ) was found increased in cells having larger ( 10 , 000 m m 2 ) as compared with smaller surface areas ( 1 , 024 m m 2 ) . Spread cells also displayed enhanced RHOA expression as compared with the conﬁned controls . These results suggested that the expression of FA - related genes and the formation of the multiprotein complexes were correlated to YAP nuclear localization and controlled by cell spreading ( Fig . 1b ) . Given the correlation between FA presence and nuclear YAP , we asked whether YAP nuclear accumulation was determined by cell size or by the formation of FAs . Therefore , we overexpressed two main FA components—vinculin and zyxin—in AD - MSCs and detected no signiﬁcant change in nuclear YAP and cell surface area ( Fig . 1c ) . Moreover , we designed single cell tools based on surface micropatterning by which cell area could be tailored independently of the availability of FN spots . By this means , cells were induced to maintain the same surface area while contacting a different number of adhesion sites . This experi - mental setting allowed us to ﬁnely tune FA number regardless of cell size . Within the same experiments , we were also able to compare cells having different cell area but constant adhesion area , as mediated by FN distribution ( Fig . 1d ) . As expected , when the adhesion area was reduced ( 4 , 900 versus 1 , 024 m m 2 ) , the number of FAs dramatically dropped ( 284 ± 38 versus 88 ± 21 , mean ± s . d . ) and the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP decreased accordingly ( 5 . 19 ± 0 . 88 versus 2 . 99 ± 1 . 44 ) . On the contrary , when cell area was kept constant ( 4 , 900 m m 2 ) but the adhesion area decreased ( 1 , 000 and 450 m m 2 ) , no signiﬁcant effect on YAP nuclear localization was detected ( 5 . 20 ± 0 . 88 versus 4 . 66 ± 0 . 94 or 4 . 32 ± 1 . 08 , respectively ) , independently of the reduction in FA number ( from 283 . 9 ± 38 . 14 to 207 . 0 ± 20 . 30 and 210 . 7 ± 36 . 80 , respectively ; Fig . 1e ) . When the adhesion area was reduced to 254 m m 2 in cells preserving constant area ( 4 , 900 m m 2 ) , no FA spike organization was detected , while YAP nuclear localization was not signiﬁcantly affected ( n ¼ 10 , 3 technical replicates , Dunn’s test , * * * * P o 0 . 0001 , * * * P o 0 . 001 and * * P o 0 . 01 ) . Lower adhesion areas ( 176 m m 2 ) did not allow cell adhesion . These results pointed at YAP nuclear accumulation as a function of cell area rather than FA formation , as controlled by ECM adhesion . Moreover , they raised the possibility that the acquisition of cell area could directly affect YAP localization and function , independently of FA assembly . YAP tunes FAs and cell stiffness in response to cell area . To explore the connection among cell area , YAP and FAs , we knocked down YAP in AD - MSCs by short hairpin RNA ( shYAP ) and controlled cell area through FN - coated micropatterns . The same experiment was performed with cells in which YAP para - logue protein TAZ ( shTAZ ) was silenced , as cells grown onto PLL ( lacking FAs ) displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in TAZ nuclear localization as compared with those cultured on FN ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The selective silencing of YAP or TAZ was conﬁrmed in quantitative PCR analysis ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Although control cells ( CTR FN ) were able to acquire the given size and shape over FN micropatterns , shYAP cells displayed impaired FA maturation and acquired a bulging phenotype with deranged F - actin cytoskeleton protruding in spikes . On the contrary , TAZ - deprived cells preserved a correct cytoskeleton arrangement and developed FAs , while losing their ability to spread on the given surface : ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 2b and Supplementary Movies 1 – 3 ) . Given these results , we decided to impair both YAP and TAZ nuclear localization in the cells , by culturing them onto N - cadherin micropatterns . The use of this experimental condition was suggested by the evidence that the concomitant silencing of both YAP and TAZ did not allow the cells to adhere . Consistent with the model of cadherin – catenin system sequestering both YAP and TAZ at the cell – cell interaction site 19 , 20 , AD - MSCs grown onto N - cadherin - coated surface and stained with an antibody recognizing both YAP and TAZ displayed no nuclear localization of the proteins . In such conditions , FA formation was completely abrogated , cytoskeleton ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 15321 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications was disrupted and cells failed to acquire the given shape and size ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2c ) . FAs and cytoskeleton are required to control cell mechanics in response to ECM cues 10 , 21 . Therefore , we decided to measure the stiffness of shYAP and shTAZ AD - MSCs by atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . The analysis of single cell Young’s Modulus clariﬁed that both shYAP and shTAZ cells were signiﬁcantly less stiff than the control and comparable to cells lacking FAs ( Fig . 2b ) .

Altogether , the results indicated that—besides acting as mechanosensors by perceiving ECM mechanics , similar to that previously shown 7 —YAP and TAZ are responsible of regulating cell stiffness in AD - MSCs . Moreover , the data suggested that YAP activity was exerted by controlling the assembly of FAs . YAP / TAZ are known to exert their function as transcriptional co - activators mainly by binding TEAD transcription factor 22 . Therefore , we transiently overexpressed in two different cell types ( AD - MSCs and Cal51 ) constructs coding for mutants of YAP and TAZ having a nuclear ( YAP S127A , TAZ S89A ) or cytoplasmic ( YAP D PDZ , TAZ D 304 ) localization 23 – 25 . YAP S127A and TAZ S89A mutants cannot be phosphorylated by LATS1 / 2 kinases and thus are predominantly located in cell nucleus and transcriptionally active 26 . On the other hand , YAP D PDZ and TAZ D 304 mutants lack the PDZ domain , which is required for nuclear shuttling 22 and thus are sequestered to the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2d ) . Staining transfected cells for FA protein vinculin highlighted an increase in the signal and an altered distribution of FA spikes induced by the transcriptionally active YAP mutant ( YAP S127A ) . On the contrary , no change in FA expression was triggered by TAZ constitutively active mutant ( TAZ S89A ) and the cytoplasmic mutants of both proteins ( YAP D PDZ and TAZ D 304 ) ( Fig . 2e ) . Overall , these results suggested that the nuclear presence and the co - transcriptional activity of YAP were requested to promote FA formation . YAP directly regulates the expression of FA - related genes . To understand whether YAP nuclear activity determines a direct activation of FA genes , we performed chromatin immunopreci - pitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP - Seq ) analysis of YAP - speciﬁc DNA binding sites in CAL51 cells . A total of 7 , 278 peaks accounting for 4 , 321 unique hits were identiﬁed , this number being consistent with previous analysis performed on different cell types 9 , 27 . A very limited amount of YAP - binding sites were promoters , most of them being intergenic or intronic ( Fig . 3a , b ) . The list of all targets identiﬁed is reported in Supplementary Data 2 , whereas the methodology adopted and quality metrics parameters are reported in Supplementary Fig . 4 . As YAP does not possess any ability to bind DNA per se , we analysed the transcription factor binding motifs known to target the sites identiﬁed by ChIP - Seq . The analysis yielded a number of potential partners involved in YAP co - transcriptional activity ( Supplementary Data 3 ) , with some of them being well - known to interact with YAP ( TEAD1 , p73 , RUNX1 , RUNX2 and PPARG ) , while others being newly related to YAP1 , such as REST , RREB1 and ESR1 ( Fig . 3c ) . Molecular function annotation of the identiﬁed hits clariﬁed most of the genes targeted by YAP are involved in cell development , cell growth and proliferation and in the acquisition of cell morphology , roles which have been previously associated to YAP activity ( Fig . 3d ) 27 . More interestingly , among the functions revealed by the analysis , those related to the formation and number of FAs displayed high scores ( P ¼ 1 . 85 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 4 and P ¼ 1 . 88 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 3 , respectively , n ¼ 3 , Fisher’s exact test ) , while also categories correlated to cytoskeleton organization and formation were represented ( P ¼ 6 . 15 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 4 ) ( Supplementary Data 4 ) . The ability of YAP to target FA genes was corroborated by comparing our original data with the results published by an independent research group in MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer line 27 ( P ¼ 1 . 3 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 4 ; Easy score ; Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . YAP controls FA integrity downstream of RhoA GTPase pathway . Given the evidence that YAP can directly target FA - related genes , we generated CAL51 stable mutant cell lines lacking YAP by CRISPR / Cas9 technology . The characterization of the cell lines is shown in Supplementary Fig . 5b – e . As predicted by ChIP - Seq analysis , YAP mutant clones underwent a switch in the expression of genes involved in FA formation and cell – ECM interaction ( Fig . 4a ) . Remarkably , the expression of known targets of YAP like CTGF was consistently reduced in mutant cells . More importantly , the expression proﬁle of integrin subunits was found altered in YAP - depleted cells . ITGA1 , ITGA4 and ITGAV , which were also identiﬁed as direct targets of YAP in ChIP - Seq analysis , were consistently altered in YAP mutant cells ( Fig . 4b ) . In addition , changes in ITGA5 , ITGB3 and ITGB1 were conﬁrmed at the protein level ( Fig . 4c ) and suggested a higher degree of complexity other than the direct gene targeting by YAP . These changes were accompanied by a clear reduction in key FA structural proteins vinculin and zyxin , and the displacement of talin ( Fig . 4d , e and Supplementary Fig . 6a ) . Similar results were obtained in HEK293 YAP - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . As a result of the inability of developing FA spikes , cells lacking YAP encountered a dramatic shift in cell morphology with colonies failing to spread and acquire their regular shape ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . Cell shape is determined by the tight interplay between FAs and cytoskeleton , with docking proteins Ezrin / Radixin / Moesin ( ERM ) and Enabled / vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein ( VASP ) being responsible for the stabilization of the interphase 21 , 28 – 31 . Mutant cells displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in ERM expression and its phosphorylated form together with decreased phosphorylation on S157 site of VASP , responsible for its localization to the FAs . No change in VASP phosphorylation at S239 site was detected , a modiﬁcation needed for cytoskeleton stabilization 29 . As expected for cells lacking FA spikes , a marked reduction in FAK autophosphorylation on Tyr397 site was found in YAP mutant cells , indicating a lack of integrin heterodimerization , a step needed for FA assembly 32 ( Fig . 4e ) . The integrity of the interphase between FAs and cytoskeleton is required for the cell to establish a functional connection with the ECM during morphogenesis and migration 33 . As expected , mutant cells lost the ability to spread over the ECM , as measured by cell contact area ( A WT ¼ 873 . 1 ± 331 . 0 m m 2 versus A CRIPR / CAS9 : YAP1 : 254 . 4 ± 153 . 8 m m 2 ) , became softer ( E WT ¼ 1320 . 62 ± 409 . 78 Pa versus A CRIPR / CAS9 : YAP1 : 405 . 28 ± 143 . 29 Pa ) ( n ¼ 24 , 3 technical replicates , * P o 0 . 001 and * * P o 0 . 0001 , Welch’s t - test ) and failed to migrate in two - dimensional and three - dimensional conditions ( two technical replicates , Dunn‘s test , * * * * P o 0 . 001 and * * P o 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 4f , g ) . This effect was accompanied in YAP - deﬁcient cells by the modulation of genes encoding for proteins involved in the degradation of ECM ( Fig . 4g and Supplementary Movie 4 ) . Rho / ROCK axis is considered to be the main mechanosensing pathway perceiving ECM mechanics 34 , 35 , being able to control not only FA formation 36 but also actin polymerization dynamics by keeping coﬁlin severing protein in the phosphorylated , inactive form 30 . As Rho / ROCK have been found to control YAP shuttling in different reports 37 and no impairment in RhoA , ROCK1 and ROCK2 gene expression was induced by YAP - depleted cells , we next asked whether these effects are connected . YAP - deﬁcient cells displayed a rearrangement in F - actin cytoskeleton in a similar manner to what we described in shYAP AD - MSCs ( Fig . 4h ) , but no evident changes in the tubulin network ( Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . Western blot analysis of the ratio between F - and G - actin clariﬁed no impairment in actin bundle polymerization occurred in cells lacking YAP ( Fig . 4i ) . The cells had unaltered ROCK2 levels and accumulated the NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 15321 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 5 phosphorylated inactive form of actin severing protein coﬁlin ( Fig . 4j ) . These results clariﬁed that the lack of FA structural and docking proteins prevented the anchorage of cell cytoskeleton to the membrane , and that Rho / ROCK role in actin dynamics was independent of YAP activity . On the other hand , we asked whether YAP nuclear shuttling was required for Rho / ROCK acknowledged control over FA formation . The treatment with pharmacological inhibitors interfering with Rho / ROCK pathway at different levels , ( Y27362 , LIMKi3 and cytochalasin D ) caused YAP shuttling to the cytoplasm , triggered cytoskeleton disassembly and the disappearance of FAs ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . On the contrary , the overexpression of RhoA - Q63L constitutively active mutant increased YAP nuclear localization ( Fig . 4k ) and resulted in a marked increase in FA signal together with the formation of stress ﬁbres . Rho hyperactive mutant failed to induce the formation of FAs in YAP - deprived lines ( Fig . 4l ) . These data clariﬁed that YAP was necessary downstream of Rho / ROCK to govern FA formation and cell – matrix interaction . Cell mechanics is determined by YAP - induced FA assembly . Given the plethora of DNA targets hit by YAP and connected to FA assembly , we asked what are the key genes targeted by YAP that trigger the formation of FAs , thus determining cell spreading and mechanics . Therefore , we complemented YAP mutant cells with single components of the FA complex with a structural function that were depleted or mismatched in mutant cells ( vinculin , zyxin , talin , a V - , b 1 - and b 3 - integrins ) . As a control for proteins that were not affected , we also included a 9 integrin . As expected , although YAP transduction in mutant cells restored some degree of vinculin and zyxin expression , single FA proteins such as vinculin , zyxin , talin , a 9 - , a V - , b 1 - and b 3 - integrin failed to induce any change in cell ability to interact with the ECM , as measured by cell surface area and cell morphology ( n ¼ 26 , 3 technical replicates , Dunn’s test , * * * * P o 0 . 0001 ) . ( Fig . 5a and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . In previous reports , a V b 1 and a V b 3 integrins—two major subsets of integrins displaced in YAP - depleted cells—were associated to cell mechanics , adhesion and migration 38 , 39 . Therefore , we co - transfected mutant cells with a V b 1 and a V b 3 - integrins . No signiﬁcant increase in mutant cell surface area was induced by a V b 1 , whereas a signiﬁcant and consistent restoration was obtained with a V b 3 transfection ( A a V b 3 ¼ 751 . 5 . 1 ± 316 . 8 m m 2 versus A CRIPR / CAS9 : YAP1 : 346 . 6 ± 161 . 1 m m 2 ) , similar to the values obtained by re - expressing S127A YAP ( A S127A ¼ 903 . 8 ± 404 . 8 m m 2 ) constitutively active mutant and wild type cells ( A WT ¼ 823 . 1 ± 355 . 2 m m 2 ; Fig . 5b , c ) ( n ¼ 3 independent experiments , Dunn’s test , * * * * P o 0 . 0001 ) . As a result , YAP - defective cells transfected with a V b 3 integrins developed a higher surface energy ( g a V b 3 : ( 3 . 7 ± 1 . 3 ) (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 3 m m (cid:3) 2 versus g CRIPR / CAS9 : YAP1 : ( 4 . 2 ± 1 . 6 ) (cid:3) 10 (cid:3) 4 J m m (cid:3) 2 , n ¼ 3 inde - pendent experiments , Games – Howell test * P o 0 . 05 and * * P o 0 . 01 ) and became signiﬁcantly stiffer than the mutant cells ( g a V b 3 : 952 . 8 ± 248 . 5 Pa versus g CRIPR / CAS9 : YAP1 : 533 . 9 ± 80 . 9 Pa , n ¼ 3 independent experiments , Games – Howell test * P o 0 . 05 and * * * P o 0 . 001 ) when measured in AFM . – log10 ( P value ) a b c d Cellular development Cellular growth and proliferation Cell morphology Cellular assembly and organization Cellular function and maintenance Cellular movement Cell - to - cell signalling and interaction Cell death and survival Cell cycle Small molecule biochemistry Cell signalling Post - translational modication Free radical scavenging Molecular transport Protein synthesis DNA replication , recombination and repair Lipid metabiolism Carbohydrate metabolism Cellular compromise Drug metabolism 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 4 . 5 5 Sample1 Sample 2 Sample3 Sample input Non - coding0 % Promoter1 % Intergenic49 % Intron47 % 3 ′ UTR 66 3 , 443 3 , 564242867 383 5 ′ UTR ExonIntronIntergenicNon - coding PromoterTTS TTS1 % 3 ′ UTR1 % 5 ′ UTR0 % EXON1 % – 5 k b – 5 k b Figure 3 | YAP directly targets FA genes in CAL51 cells .

Small GTPase Rho indirectly controls YAP / TAZ nuclear localization by promoting the formation of actin bundles and stress ﬁbres in response to the spreading of the cell over ECM 12 , 40 . Moreover , YAP / TAZ upstream kinase LATS is targeted by integrin - FAK signalling through Src 15 . These results depicted a role for Hippo effectors as a hub for different signalling pathways sensing ECM composition and mechanics through cytoskeleton stability . Here we demonstrate that : ( 1 ) YAP nuclear localization is controlled by cell area through Rho / ROCK activation and independent of FA formation ; and ( 2 ) YAP transcriptionally controls FA formation CTNNB1CTNNA1LAMC1ITGB1FN1ADAMTS1TIMP2SGCECOL4A2SPG7VCANCTNND1COL6A1 COL6A2 LAMB1 LAMA3 MMP16THBS3SPARCCOL1A1 COL7A1ICAM1VTNECM1ITGA7LAMA2ITGB4MMP9ITGA2 ADAMTS13 CDH1 TIMP1ITGB5ITGA6 ITGAVITGA5 ITGA3 ITGA1CTGFMMP11MMP15ADAMTS8 TNCCD44LAMB3 LAMA1 ITGB3 ITGB2 ITGA8ITGA4 COL15A1 COL12A1VCAM1THBS2TGFBISELPSELLSELEPECAM1MMP8MMP7MMP3MMP10ANOS1HAS1CTNND2COL8A1COL11A1 CNTN1SPP1MMP12MMP1ITGAMITGAL NCAM1CLEC3B THBS1 COL14A1 COL16A1 COL5A1TIMP3 MMP13MMP2 MMP14 RHOACDC42RAC1 CAPN2 CTNNB1 ACTN4 HRASVCLCRK GRB2PAK4GSK3BPDPK1ROCK1PXNROCK2PARVAVAV2DOCK1PAK1BCAR1PRKCAITGB5SHC1RAPGEF1VASP RAP1APTK2DIAPH1FLNBARHGAP5ACTN1 RAF1ZYX RAP1B TLN1 PAK2 ITGB1CRKL AKT2AKT1 FLNA ITGA6SOS1SRC CAV1 FYN ILK ITGA2BITGA1ITGA7 PRKCGTNS1VAV1RASGRF1PRKCBPAK3CAB3ACTN2RAC2ITGB6ITGA11PARBGITGAXITGA8ITGA4ITGAMITGAL ITGB4ITGA9ITGA2ITGB3PARVBITGB2 PIP5K1CPTEN SOS2 PLEC ITGAV DST ITGA5 AKT3ITGA3 CAV2 C A L - 51 W T ( 1 ) C A L - 51 W T ( 2 ) C A L - 51 C 3 ( 1 ) C A L - 51 C 3 ( 2 ) C A L - 51 W T ( 1 ) C A L - 51 W T ( 2 ) C A L - 51 C 3 ( 1 ) C A L - 51 C 3 ( 2 ) C A L - 51 W T ( 1 ) C A L - 51 W T ( 2 ) C A L - 51 C 3 ( 1 ) C A L - 51 C 3 ( 2 ) C A L - 51 W T ( 1 ) C A L - 51 W T ( 2 ) C A L - 51 C 3 ( 1 ) C A L - 51 C 3 ( 2 ) CN T N 1 A C T N 2 P R K C B I T G A 8 T I M P 3 VAV 1 PA R VB I T G A 4 NC A M 1 PAK 3 L A M A 1 C O L14 A 1 MM P 2 C O L5 A 1 AK T 3 A D A M T S 13 P R K C G I T G A 2 T N S 1 I T G A 7 F Y N I T G A 1 T NCD S T C O L16 A 1 P T E N V C A M 1 C O L6 A 1 MM P 11 C O L6 A 2 C L E C 3 B I T G A 5 C O L1 A 1 R O C K 1 I T G B 4 C T NN A 1 B C A R 1 V C A N R AP G E F 1 Z YX MM P 16 VASP C O L4 A 2 CDH 1 A C T N 4 A C T N 1 I T G B 1 L A M C 1 V C L F L N A I T G B 5 L A M B 1 PA R VA I T G B 2 I T G A M T I M P 2 L A M A 2 MM P 15 L A M B 3 S G C E I T G AV A D A M T S 8 C AV 2 I T G A 9 C AV 1 V T N SPA RC I C A M 1 I T G B 6 I T G B 3 CD 44 T H BS 1 C O L12 A 1 SPP 1 SE LL C T G F MM P 14 I L K CR K L Normalized Δ C t 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 2 , 548 ± 26 2 , 090 ± 414 1 , 031 ± 387 389 ± 59 371 ± 21 118 ± 39 98 ± 0 76 ± 7 65 ± 10 64 ± 6 – 54 ± 8 – 62 ± 6 – 96 ± 243 – 176 ± 60 – 218 ± 322 – 234 ± 77 – 543 ± 0 – 750 ± 55 – 1 , 020 ± 1 , 460 – 1 , 651 ± 6 , 091 - – 3 , 393 ± 55 , 029 573 ± 191 593 ± 216 670 ± 19 838 ± 147 – 50 – 25 0 25 50 50 μ m 50 μ m 50 μ m 50 μ m 50 μ m 20 μ m 20 μ m 20 μ m 20 μ m 20 μ m 20 μ m 20 μ m 5 μ m 50 μ m 50 μ m 200 150 100 50 0 C e ll s / f i e l d CAL51 WT C2a C3 CRISPR / Cas9 : Yap1 200 20 0 – 20 – 200 – 400 A D A M T S 8 A D A M T S 13 T I M P 3 T I M P 2 T I M P 14 T I M P 15 T I M P 16 F o l d r egu l a t i on * * * * * * 2 , 500 2 , 000 1 , 500 1 , 000 500 0 2 , 500 2 , 000 1 , 500 1 , 000 500 0 * * * * * * * 21 . 81 . 61 . 41 . 210 . 80 . 60 . 40 . 20 DAPI YAP EGFP - RHoA - Q63L F - actin C on t a c t a r ea ( μ m 2 ) Y oung ’ s m odu l u s ( P a ) CAL51 M CTR C2a C3 p - ERM ERM VASP ( 157 ) p - VASP ( 239 ) VASP FAK p - FAK ( 397 ) GAPDH 75 kDa 75 kDa 50 kDa 50 kDa 50 kDa 100 kDa 100 kDa 37 kDa ROCK2 p - cofilin cofilin GAPDH 150 kDa 20 kDa 20 kDa 37 kDa Integrin α 4 Integrin α 5 Integrin α V Integrin β1 Integrin β3 Integrin β 4 Integrin β5 Vinculin Zyxin Talin GAPDH 150 kDa 100 kDa 150 kDa 100 kDa 100 kDa 100 kDa 250 kDa 75 kDa 75 kDa 250 kDa 37 kDa a b c d e f g h i j k l ECM and adhesion molecules ( PAHS - 013Z ) Focal adhesion ( PAHS - 145Z ) ) F o l d r egu l a t i on C A L51 W T C A L51 W T CR I SP R / C a s 9 : Y ap1 C A L51 W T CR I SP R / C a s 9 : Y ap1 c 3 c 2 a CTR c2a c3 F - a c t i n F - a c t i n F - a c t i n G - a c t i n G - a c t i n G - a c t i n G - a c t i n / F - a c t i n r a t i o C R I SP R / C a s 9 : Y ap1 CR I SP R / C a s 9 : Y ap1 CR I SP R / C a s 9 : Y ap1 C A L51 W T CR I SP R / C a s 9 : Y ap1 C A L51 W T 2D migration 3D migration DAPI vinculin Detail DAPI F - actin Detail DAPI EGFP - RhoA - Q63L vinculin F - actin CAL51 M CTR C2a C3 CAL51 CTR c2a c3 M CTR C2a C3 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 15321 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 and cytoskeleton stability , in turn determining cell mechanics and the degree of cell adhesion to the ECM . Through a single - cell tool based on micropatterns able to control FA formation independently of cell size 41 , we clariﬁed that YAP nuclear presence in AD - MSCs does not depend on the formation of FAs , but it is rather controlled by the area of the cell itself . Cell spreading over ECM directly controls RHOA gene expression and activation and this event is crucial to stabilize cell cytoskeleton by inhibiting the F - actin severing protein coﬁlin through phosphorylation by LIMK 35 . As conﬁrmed in previous studies 12 , YAP acts downstream of Rho / ROCK and is sensitive to F - actin bundle polymerization . Conversely , the integrity of cytoskeleton actin bundles was not affected per se by YAP depletion , as shown by the unaltered ratio between F - and G - actin , and the sustained phosphorylation of coﬁlin severing protein , thus indicating that Rho / ROCK role in actin dynamics was independent of YAP activity . The activation of Rho GTPase pathway is also required to foster the maturation of FAs in cells in contact with the ECM 36 . The anchorage of cell cytoskeleton to the FAs is of paramount importance to control cell shape and mechanics , with docking proteins such as vinculin , talin , zyxin , ERM and VASP being primarily involved in coupling cytoskeleton to integrins 21 , 28 – 31 . The lack of YAP in the cell caused the complete absence of the typical FA spikes highlighting the inability of YAP mutant cells to interact with the surrounding ECM . As a control , cells over - expressing the constitutively active and nuclear form of YAP ( S127A YAP ) showed an increased FA formation . YAP - depleted cells showed a reduced expression of FA stabilizing proteins ERM , vinculin and zyxin , and showed altered localization of actin docking protein VASP . The decreased expression and phosphorylation of ERM , a set of proteins providing structural linkage between transmembrane components and actin ﬁlaments 42 together with the decreased phosphorylation on S157 site of VASP—a protein entitled to stabilize the interaction among FA docking proteins and actin cytoskeleton 29 —accounted for the failure in promoting the anchorage between the cytoskeleton and FAs . Our ChIP - Seq analysis clariﬁes that the stability of FA - cytoskeleton interphase is directly under the control of YAP : YAP co - transcriptional function , as determined by cell area through Rho / ROCK - mediated cytoskeleton assembly , directly targets DNA binding sites responsible for the production of a number of proteins involved in FA and cytoskeleton assembly and crucial to cell - ECM interaction . These results , obtained in breast cancer CAL51 cells , are conﬁrmed in other cell types by an unbiased meta - analysis performed on ChIP - Seq data previously obtained by other research groups 9 , 27 . YAP displayed a speciﬁc DNA - binding signature for genes encoding for proteins involved in cytoskeleton stabilization ( CAPZA1 , CAPZA2 , ABRA , ACTRT1 , CKAP4 , CKAP4 and TLN2 ) and connection to the membrane ( PCDH15 , CTNNA2 , CTNNA3 , CTNNB1 , CTNND2 , FAT3 , PCDH7 , PCDH17 , PCDH10 , PCDH20 , CDH8 , CDH5 , CDH2 , CDH20 and CDH26 ) . Among YAP - targeted genes , those related to dystrophin / sarcoglycan complex ( SGCD , SGCG , ZSC1 , SNTB1 and IMPG2 ) have also been identiﬁed in the fetal heart 13 as YAP targets and directly related to the stabilization of the cytoskeleton . Interestingly , YAP depletion resulted in the rearrangement of integrin expression pattern . Integrin expression proﬁle modulates cell migration in response to ECM cues , with a V b 1 being responsible for random cell migration , whereas a V b 3 induce persistent directional cell migration 43 . The latter has also been shown to increase cell stiffness and is currently being targeted by etaracizumab monoclonal antibody in clinical studies aimed at hindering cancer propagation 44 . Although not being detected by our analysis as a direct target of YAP , b 3 integrin is among the genes displaced by YAP knockout and , when re - expressed in combination with its partner a V , restored cell mechanical properties and the ability to spread . This evidence reinforces the indication of YAP as a target for cancer molecular therapy 45 . The evidence that YAP - depleted cells encountered a signiﬁcant reduction in their stiffness qualiﬁed YAP as a pivotal component of the mechanosensing apparatus and depicted a model in which YAP co - transcriptional activity is required for the synthesis of docking and stabilizing proteins allowing cell tension generation . Not surprisingly , the absence of adhesion complexes in YAP mutant cells resulted in their impaired ability to get a grip on the surrounding ECM . Indeed , cells lacking YAP displayed lower adhesion energy and reduced contact area when interacting with elements of the ECM . As a proof - of - concept , mutant cells failed to migrate and invade the surrounding matrix , when challenged in two - dimensional and three - dimensional assays . YAP has been historically described to exert overlapping / redundant functions with its paralog protein TAZ 37 . Although TAZ depletion performed similarly in terms of cell mechanics in our cell models , it did not affect FA dynamics , this being an exclusive feature of YAP . Moreover , the mild observed upregulation of TAZ in YAP - silenced cells was incapable to counteract FA loss 46 . The apparent discrepancy between YAP and TAZ activities could be explained by the slight but consistent differences in the transcriptional and functional signatures of YAP and TAZ reported here and by others 46 , 27 . Solving this puzzle deserves further investigations . Figure 4 | YAP regulates focal adhesion / cytoskeleton integrity downstream of RhoA .

The full list of antibodies and dilutions can be found in Supplementary Data 5 . The original blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 9 . Scanning electron microscopy . Cal51 WT and YAP mutant cells were cultured in ﬁbronectin - coated coverslips for two days , ﬁxed with a solution of Glutaraldehyde 3 % in 100mM Cacodylate buffer and dehydrated in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations . Samples were mounted on aluminium stubs , sputter - coated with Palladium ( JEOL JFC - 1300 , Tokyo , Japan ) and imaged with a Benchtop Scanning Electron Microscope JEOL JCM - 6000 ( Tokyo , Japan ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation . CAL51 cells were cultured in complete medium for 48h . Chromatin was immunoprecipitated from three technical replicates using a ChIP - grade anti - YAP antibody ( Cell Signaling Technologies ) and following the manufacturer’s instructions ( Pierce Agarose ChIP Kit , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) . Control ChIP was performed by adding mouse immunoglobulins ( IgG ) . The samples were eluted in 30 m l of eluting buffer and stored at - 80 (cid:2) C before the analysis . Library preparation and sequencing . Library preparation was performed and size distribution of each ChIP DNA sample was assessed by running a 1 m l aliquot on Agilent High Sensitivity DNA chip using an Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies ) . The concentration of each DNA sample was determined by using Quant - IT DNA Assay Kit - High Sensitivity and Qubit Fluorometer ( Life Technologies ) . Ten nanograms of puriﬁed ChIP DNA were used as starting material for sequencing libraries preparation . Indexed libraries were prepared with TruSeq ChIP Sample Prep Kit ( Illumina Inc . ) . Libraries were sequenced ( single read , 1x50 cycles ) at a concentration of 10 pM / lane on HiSeq 2500 ( Illumina Inc . ) . ChIP - Seq data analysis . Data analysis was performed by Genomix4Life S . r . l ( Baronissi , Italy ) . The raw sequence ﬁles generated ( . fastq ) underwent quality control analysis using FASTQC ( http : / / www . bioinformatics . babraham . ac . uk ) . Reads were aligned to the human genome ( assembly hg19 ) using bowtie 49 , allowing up to 1 mismatch and considering uniquely mappable reads . The reads of biological replicates and corresponding input samples were merged for peaks calling as previously described 50 . ChIP - Seq peaks were identiﬁed and analysed using HOMER 51 ( - F : 2 . 0 , - L : 2 . 0 and - C : 1 . 0 ) with false discovery rate o 0 . 01 . The assignment of YAP peaks to target genes was obtained by the web tool ChIPSeek 52 . Through this step , it was possible to assign peaks to transcription start site ( by default deﬁned from (cid:3) 1kb to þ 100bp ) , transcription termination site ( by default deﬁned from (cid:3) 100bp to þ 1kb ) , Exon ( Coding ) , 5 0 - untranslated region ( UTR ) Exon , 3 0 UTR Exon , Intronic or Intergenic . As some annotation overlap , the following order of priority was chosen for the assignment : (cid:4) Transcription start site ( by default deﬁned from (cid:3) 1kb to þ 100bp ) (cid:4) Transcription termination site ( by default deﬁned from (cid:3) 100bp to þ 1kb ) (cid:4) CDS exons (cid:4) 5 0 UTR exons (cid:4) 3 0 UTR exons (cid:4) * * CpG islands (cid:4) * * Repeats (cid:4) Introns (cid:4) Intergenic Over - represented sequence motifs were deﬁned according to motif descriptors of JASPAR database and computed using PScan - ChIP 53 . The following parameters were set : (cid:4) Organism : Homo Sapiens (cid:4) Assembly : hg19 (cid:4) Background : Mixed (cid:4) Descriptors : Jaspar 2016 Nucleotide best occurrence was calculated by weblogo ( http : / / weblogo . berkeley . edu / ) by running Report Best Occurrences analysis on any given transcription factor . Functional enrichment analysis was performed using IPA ( IPA , QIAGEN , Redwood City , www . qiagen . com / ingenuity ) by using the following parameters : (cid:4) Reference set : Ingenuity Knowledge Base ( Genes Only ) (cid:4) Relationship to include : Direct and Indirect (cid:4) Filter : Consider only molecules and / or relationship where ( species ¼ Human ) AND ( conﬁdence ¼ Experimentally Observed ) . An unbiased comparison was performed between the single YAP targets obtained in the CAL51 ChIP - Seq analysis and the ones previously reported for MDA - MB - 231 ( ref . 27 ) . The mutual targets enrichment for KEGG biological pathways was examined through the Database for Annotation , Visualization and Integrated Discovery 6 . 8 . An a ¼ 0 , 01 for the EASE score P - value was used as a threshold . Single - and collective cell invasion assays . Single - cell invasion was assayed by culturing 30 , 000 CAL51 WT and YAP mutant cells on ECM pre - coated transwell chambers with 8 m m pores and allowed to migrate for 24h , according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( ECM508 - Chemotaxis Cell Migration Assay , Merck Millipore ) . Cells in the bottom of the ﬁlters were stained with crystal violet , counted in twelve random ﬁelds and averaged for the replicate wells . Growth factor - reduced Matrigel ( BD Biosciences , New Jersey , USA ) was diluted to 4mgml (cid:3) 1 in serum free - cold cell culture media . 10 m l Matrigel containing 1500 wild type or YAP - mutant CAL51 were transferred to each well of a m - Slide ( Ibidi , Martinsried , Germany ) . Matrigel was allowed to solidify at 37 (cid:2) C for 20min , before adding complete medium . Medium was changed after 3 days . Young’s modulus mapping by AFM . Standard bioAFM microscope JPK NanoWizard 3 ( JPK , Berlin , Germany ) was used to perform force mapping pro - cedure . The scanning - by - probe head ( maximal visualization range 100 - 100 - 15 m m in X - Y - Z axis ) of AFM microscope was placed on inverted optical microscope Olympus IX - 81 , (cid:2) 10 objective was used to ﬁnd proper area covered with cells and to place cantilever in the proper position for force mapping procedure . Plastic Petri dish ( TPP , Trasadingen , Switzerland ) with either the distilled water for instrument calibration or with cell culture was placed inside the Petri dish heater ( JPK ) pre - heated to 37 (cid:2) C for 30min . Non - coated silicon nitride AFM cantilever Hydra 2R - 100N ( AppNano , California , USA ) equipped with pyramidal silicon tip was used for all the experiments . The probe was calibrated before each experiment as described below . Then the laser reﬂection sum was maximized , followed by centering of the laser detector . The AFM probe was introduced in contact with the surface during a standard process of landing . The sensitivity of the AFM setup was determined as a slope of the force - distance curve ( FDC ) measured by lifting the cantilever with Z - height of 450nm , time per curve was 3s . The sensitivity was found in the range 15 . 07 - 15 . 37nmV (cid:3) 1 , cantilever stiffness was calibrated by measurement of its thermal noise and resulted between 17 . 34 and 19 . 19pNnm (cid:3) 1 for different days of experiments . The bioAFM setting was identical for all the force mapping procedure . SetPoint value was 1 . 0nN ( relative to baseline value ) , time per curve 0 . 5s , Z - length 15 . 0 m m , speed of curve recording 30 m ms (cid:3) 1 , the FDCs were recorded with data sample rate of 2kHz . The force mapping procedure was performed as step - by - step recording of FDCs in the network of 64 (cid:2) 64 points on 100 (cid:2) 100 m m covering area of single cell for AD - MSCs or colonies for CAL51 . Force mapping process provides a network of FDC ( dependency of tip - sample interaction force on tip height above the surface ) , so called force maps . The absolute value of Young’s modulus can be determined by ﬁtting the FDC by Sneddon equation 54 : F ð d Þ ¼ 2 E tan a p ð 1 (cid:3) u 2 Þ d 2 Where F is the measured force , E is Young’s modulus , n is Poisson ration ( 0 . 5 for incompressible materials ) , d is tip - sample separation ( obtained by correction of the cantilever height to its bending ) and a is half - angle to face of pyramidal tip ( reﬂects the tip geometry ) . Data processing module of the JPK software was used to process the maps of FDCs in a batch mode . Resulted Young’s modulus maps were exported to be post - processed as described in the following chapter . AFM data analysis and cell mechanics evaluation . The elasticity maps obtained from measurements were pre - processed in open source SPM analysis software Gwyddion to extract geometrically coherent text tables of elasticity values and setpoint positions . Subsequently , data were processed by a Matlab ( Mathworks , Natick , Massachussets , USA ) script to remove outliers ( for example , elasticity values coming from non - contacting points ) , select the portion of data inherent to the biological sample , observing the values distribution on histogram and calculate the statistical parameters of interest . Since cell - related elasticity value showed non normal distributions ( that is , not passing a Lilliefors test ) , median and inter - quartile range were ﬁrstly computed as statistical parameters of confronta - tion . A ﬁner extraction of the mean elastic modulus was performed with the Matlab distribution ﬁtting tool , where data were found to best ﬁt an inverse Gaussian distribution . Cell adhesion energy ( g ) was calculated by using the JKR theory as described in ref . 55 , assuming a conservative volume between the ﬂoating cell and the fully adherent one , and a zero load radius , through the following equation : g ¼ 8 a 3 E 27 p R 2 where a is the equivalent zero - loads contact radius ( that is , the radius of a circle covering the same area ) of an adherent cell , R is the measured contact of a ﬂoating cell and E is the elastic modulus measured as described above through AFM force mapping technique . Cell contact area was measured by ImageJ software region of interest tool on adherent CAL51 cells . The same software tools were used to extract the ﬂoating radius of the cell strains analysed . A sample number of 24 , based on the NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 15321 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms15321 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 sample number selected from the elasticity values , was considered selecting data with the minimum distance from their median . Statistical analysis . Data are presented as mean ± s . d . and were calculated using the software package GraphPad Prism v . 6 . 0 . For single cell analysis , a minimum of ten cells per sample was considered . The number of cells in 12 random ﬁelds per sample was evaluated in the migration assay . Statistical analyses were performed using Kruskal - Wallis test followed by post hoc multiple comparisons by Dunn’s test . P 4 0 . 01 was not considered statistically signiﬁcant . AFM data are shown in boxplot format , considering the median ± min / max values calculated for each selected sample . For AD - MSCs data , which did not pass the Lilliesford normality test , statistical signiﬁcance was calculated with the Kruskal - Wallis test followed by post hoc Dunn’s test , and accepted for a P o 0 . 05 . For CAL51 data , passing the Lilliefors normality test but not homoscedasticity F - test , statistical signiﬁcance was assessed by an unpaired two - tailed Welch’s t - test , or Welch’s analysis of variance test followed by Games – Howell test . Sample sizes were based on previously published experiments , in which statistical differences were identiﬁed . Data availability . ChIP - Seq analysis data were submitted to ArrayExpress database ( https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / arrayexpress / ) where they can be accessed by the accession number : E - MTAB - 5217 .
