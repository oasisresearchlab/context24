Penczek 4 & Stefan Raunser 1 Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) is the major protein of muscle thin fila - ments , and actin microfilaments are the main component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton . Mutations in different actin isoforms lead to early - onset autosomal dominant non - syndromic hearing loss 1 , familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections 2 , and multiple variations of myopathies 3 . In striated muscle fibres , the binding of myosin motors to actin filaments is mainly regulated by tropomyo - sin and troponin 4 , 5 . Tropomyosin also binds to F - actin in smooth muscle and in non - muscle cells and stabilizes and regulates the fila - ments therein theabsenceoftroponin 6 . Although crystal structures formonomericactin ( G - actin ) areavailable 7 , ahigh - resolutionstruc - tureofF - actinisstillmissing , hamperingourunderstandingofhow disease - causing mutations affect the function of thin muscle fila - ments and microfilaments . Here we report the three - dimensional structure of F - actin at a resolution of 3 . 7 A˚ in complex with tropo - myosin at a resolution of 6 . 5 A˚ , determined by electron cryomicro - scopy . The structure reveals that the D - loop is ordered and acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions that stabilizetheF - actinfilament . Weclearlyidentifymapdensitycorre - spondingtoADPandMg 2 1 andexplainthepossibleeffectofprom - inentdisease - causingmutants . AcomparisonofF - actinwithG - actin reveals the conformational changes during filament formation and identifies the D - loop as their key mediator . We also confirm that negatively charged tropomyosin interacts with a positively charged groove on F - actin . Comparison of the position of tropomyosin in F - actin – tropomyosinwithitspositioninourpreviouslydetermined F - actin – tropomyosin – myosin structure 8 reveals a myosin - induced transition of tropomyosin . Our results allow us to understand the roleofindividualmutationsinthegenesisofactin - andtropomyosin - relateddiseasesandwillserveasastrongfoundationforthetargeteddevelopmentofdrugs . To determine the structure of F - actin is inherently difficult because of its flexibility and its resistance to crystallization . Therefore , the only structural models of F - actin so far have been determined either from medium - resolutionelectroncryomicroscopy ( cryo - EM ) maps 9 – 13 orby interpretingX - rayfibrediffractiondata 14 , whichhascertainlimitations . Using a direct electron detector and drift correction and by improving theimageprocessingofhelicalspecimens ( seeMethods ) , wehavedeter - mined the structure of F - actin in complex with tropomyosin at an averageresolutionof 3 . 7 A˚ forF - actin and6 . 5A˚ for tropomyosin using cryo - EM ( Fig . 1a , ExtendedDataFigs1a , b , 2a , SupplementaryVideo1 ) . During refinement the helical parameters—that is , the rise per subunit and the azimuthal rotation—were estimated to be 27 . 5 A˚ and 166 . 4 u , respectively ( see Methods ) . The side - chaindensities of most actinresi - dueswereclearlyresolved ( ExtendedDataFig . 3 , SupplementaryVideo2 ) and allowed us to build an atomic model of F - actin ( Fig . 1b , Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . The first four residues of the amino terminus and the last fourresiduesofthecarboxyterminuswerenotresolved ( ExtendedData Fig . 2b – d ) , indicating that these regions are disordered in the filament . However , wecouldclearlyidentifymapdensitycorrespondingtoADP and the coordinated cation , which is most probably Mg 2 1 ( Fig . 1b , Ex - tended Data Fig . 3a ) . TheoverallorganizationofF - actinissimilartothatdescribedinpre - viousstructuresandmodels 10 , 14 . However , giventhesuperiorresolution of our structure , we could clearly identify many salt bridges and there - fore directly reveal intra - and intermolecular interactions of the F - actin filament in detail ( Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . F - actin is composed of two long - pitch helical strands . Interactions betweenactinsubunitsofthesamestrandandtheopposingstrand—theso - calledintrastrandandinterstrandinteractions , respectively—stabilize the F - actin filament ( Fig . 2 , Extended Data Figs 4 and 5 ) . Intrastrand contactsaremediatedbysubdomainsSD2andSD4ofoneactinsubunitwiththeSD3oftheadjacentactinsubunitofthesamestrand ( Fig . 2a , b ) . BesidesseveralsaltbridgesbetweentheedgesofSD4andSD3 ( Fig . 2b ) , the major site of interstrand interaction is between the D - loop and the bottom of the b - sheet of SD3 ( Fig . 2c – f , Extended Data Fig . 4b – e ) . The D - loop encloses tyrosine 169 of the neighbouring subunit , resembling a lock - and - key interaction ( Fig . 2c ) . In addition , adjacent residues fit snugly into the groove formed by regions next to the D - loop around isoleucine64 ( Fig . 2d ) andaprominenthydrophobicpatchintheD - loop interacts with a hydrophobic groove on the neighbouring F - actin sub - unit ( Fig . 2e , f ) . Thus , the intrastrand interface at this position is large and is stabilized not only by electrostaticand hydrophobic interactions butalsobygeometricsurfacecomplementarity . Asexpected , mutations atthissite ( which , forinstance , inducechargesathydrophobicinterfaces ) hamper F - actin polymerization and stability ( Extended Data Fig . 4d , e ) and can lead to different forms of nemaline myopathy 3 , 15 ( Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . 1 DepartmentofStructuralBiochemistry , MaxPlanckInstituteofMolecularPhysiology , 44227Dortmund , Germany . 2 InstituteforBiophysicalChemistry , HannoverMedicalSchool , 30625Hannover , Germany . 3 DepartmentofPhysiologyandBiophysics , BostonUniversitySchoolofMedicine , Boston , Massachusetts02118 , USA . 4 DepartmentofBiochemistryandMolecularBiology , TheUniversityof Texas , HoustonMedicalSchool , Houston , Texas77030 , USA . aa 90 Å b Figure 1 | Cryo - EMstructureofF - actindecoratedwithtropomyosin . a , Full cryo - EMreconstructionofF - actin ( grey , withfivecentralsubunitsingreenand one subunit in cyan ) decorated with tropomyosin ( yellow ) . b , Close - up view of a with the atomic and molecular model of an F - actin subunit ( cyan ) and tropomyosin ( yellow ) and their corresponding densities , respectively .

All rights reserved ©2014 In contrast to most G - actin structural models , in which the D - loop is not resolved owing to its high flexibility , the D - loop is well defined in our structure ( Extended Data Fig . 3b ) , corroborating its importance in mediating actin – actin interaction . It also contrasts with results of medium - resolutioncryo - EMdata 12 anddisulphidecross - linkingstudies 16 that suggested the presence of multiple D - loop conformational states . In addition , these and other studies 17 , 18 suggested a close interaction of the D - loop with the C terminus of actin . Although the C terminus is located next to the D - loop , it is not resolved in the cryo - EM density ( Extended Data Fig . 2c ) , indicating that the interaction between these two regions is either transient or structurally flexible . Ourstructuraldeterminationalsogivesapossibleexplanationforthe recently described F - actin disassembly by Mical , a multidomain cyto - solicactinregulator 19 . Micalpost - translationallyoxidizesmethionine44 within theD - loop of actin 20 , leading to thelessflexibleand more hydro - philic sulfoxide . The increased polarity could lead to a weakening of the hydrophobic actin – actin interaction ( Extended Data Fig . 4d ) and consequently to a Mical - induced disassembly of the F - actin filament . The F - actin structure confirms that the so - called hydrophobic plug 9 connects three F - actin subunits with each other ( Fig . 2a ) . However , as suggested previously 10 , this interstrand interaction is formed by salt bridges ( Fig . 2a ) , not by hydrophobic interactions ( Extended Data Fig . 5a – e ) . A large part of the plug is negatively charged on the surface , electrostatically interacting with a positively charged patch on the oppos - ing actin , with histidine 173and lysine 284atitscentre ( Extended Data Fig . 5c – e ) .

Inter - estingly , thepresenceofATPinsteadofADPinthenucleotide - binding sitewouldbestericallyunfavourable ( ExtendedDataFig . 6d , Supplemen - taryVideo3 ) , suggestingthatadifferentintermediateconformationexists for F - actin – ATP . High - resolution crystal structures of non - vertebrate actin showed that glutamine137 positions the nucleophilic water that attacks the c - phosphate ofATP 22 . Therefore , aspreviously suggested 14 , theshorterdistanceofglutamine137tothe c - phosphateprobablyinduces ATP hydrolysis and then afterwards the cation takes the position of the c - phosphate in the finally resulting ADP - binding - state ( Extended Data Fig . 6e , Supplementary Video 3 ) . A mutation of glutamine137 connected to nemaline myopathy 23 further highlights the importance ofthisresidueintheproperfunctionofF - actin ( ExtendedDataFig . 6f ) . The comparison of the structure of G - actin ( PDB accession codes 3EL2 and 1J6Z ) with that of F - actin , which represent the start and end points of filamentformation , allowsus to describethe possibleconfor - mational changes during polymerization ( Extended Data Fig . 7 , Sup - plementary Discussion ) . The F - actin filaments were completely decorated by tropomyosin ( Fig . 1a , Extended Data Fig . 1a , b , i ) . Although tropomyosin consists of sevenpseudo - repeatingunits , applying the helicalsymmetryofF - actin forthe reconstruction of the F - actin – tropomyosincomplex results in a reduced resolutionof tropomyosin and theoverlapregionof the Nand Cterminiisnotvisibleinthemap ( seeMethods ) . However , densitiescor - respondingtothehelicesofthecoiled - coilwerewellresolved ( Fig . 1a , b ) and allowed us tofit a previous chimeric model of tropomyosin derived fromX - ray , nuclearmagneticresonanceandmoleculardynamicssimu - lation data 24 and to determine the register of thechains oftropomyosin . TogetherwiththeatomicresolutionofF - actin , thisallowsustodescribe the interaction between actin and tropomyosin in greater detail and with higher accuracy than previous studies . Tropomyosin , whichismainlynegativelychargedonitssurface , inter - acts with a positively charged groove on F - actin , confirming previous predictions ( compare refs 24 – 26 ) ( Fig . 4a , b , Extended Data Fig . 8a ) . In particular , lysines326and328onF - actinstronglyinteractwiththedif - ferent pseudo - repeats of tropomyosin ( Fig . 4c ) . The distance between tropomyosinandactinvariesdependingonthepositionalongthefilamentbetween38A˚and40A˚ . Thedistancewouldallowfordirectinteractions of opposing residues ( Fig . 4c ) and is similar to the distance in the M - state 8 and to what was previously suggested for the other states of tropomyosin 25 , 27 . TheinteractionsbetweentropomyosinandF - actinpro - bably determine the position of tropomyosin on F - actin in the Apo - state ( A - state ) , atermwerecentlyintroducedtodescribethepositionoftro - pomyosin in the absence of troponin , myosin or Ca 2 1 ( ref . 26 ) . The position of tropomyosin in the A - state in our structure ( Fig . 4a , ExtendedDataFig . 8b ) isclosetothatdescribedbySousa etal . 13 , butdiffers fromapreviouspositioningbasedonnegativestaindataandmoleculardynamicssimulations 24 . To determine the source of this discrepancy , we first repeated the negative stain work ( Extended Data Fig . 1c – j ) and indeedreproducedthedifferentposition ( ExtendedDataFig . 8c ) . How - ever , when we cross - linked the sample before staining , tropomyosin was in the same position as in our cryo - EM structure ( Extended Data Fig . 1c – h , j , ExtendedDataFig . 8d – g ) . Thisshowsthatnegativestaining rather than cryo - preparation results in a change of the tropomyosin position on F - actin . The relatively low pH of the stain ( pH 4 ) probably inducesrepulsionsattheF - actin – tropomyosininterfaceandforcestropo - myosin to change its position ( Extended Data Fig . 8h ) . In any case , the change in position depending on preparative conditions confirms the strikingabilityoftropomyosintotranslocateazimuthallyacrosstheac - tin filament at low energy cost 26 . In comparison to the previously assumed position of tropomyosin intheA - state , thenewpositionblocksonlyminorregionsofthemyosin - binding site on F - actin . This supports our previous model of myosin bindingtoactinfilamentsintheabsenceoftroponin 8 evenmorestrongly . If the current position of tropomyosin is the default state for tropomy - osin , then only loop 4 and the cardiomyopathy loop of myosin would be sterically hindered from binding to the F - actin filament ( Extended DataFig . 9a – d , SupplementaryVideo4 ) andprobablyallowsforaweak binding of myosin , especially with its lower 50 - kDa domain . Actin - induced cleft closure of myosin would then move tropomyosin to its M - state 8 ( Extended Data Fig . 9b – g , Supplementary Video 4 ) . Comparing the position of tropomyosin in the new A - state with the M - state ( ExtendedDataFig . 9h ) , wefindtwopossibletransitionsbetween the states . Either tropomyosin rolls on the F - actin filament by an azi - muthalrotationof about16 u and a left - handed rotationof about70 u or a right - handed rotation of about 110 u along its own axis ( Extended Data Fig . 9i , j ) or tropomyosin shifts by about 37A˚ ( half the length of a pseudo - repeat ) along the actin filament ( Extended Data Fig . 9k , l ) or a mixture of the two effects occurs . The distance of tropomyosin to the filamentaxisofF - actinisnotalteredduringthetransition . Gestalt - binding and rigidity of tropomyosin 28 support a shifting mechanism , whereas the spatial limitations inside the sarcomere make a shift of 37 A˚ rather unlikely . However , direct localization of the N / C - terminal overlap of tropomyosinwillbeneededtodiscriminatebetweenthetwopossibilities . Insummary , thestructureoftheF - actin - tropomyosincomplexshows how F - actin filaments are stabilized in health and destabilized in certain diseases .

Sevenframesfrom85msto475mswithatotaldoseof 14 . 6electrons per A˚ 2 andone totalaveragewith an electron dose of 30 . 7electrons per A˚ 2 were used for image processing . The defocus range of the data set was 0 . 8 – 2 . 6 m m . Thepixelsizewas1 . 14A˚perpixel , basedonthereflectionofgoldatthesame magnification . Since the inaccuracy of pixel size determination is about 2 % with thismethod , weusedthewell - definedrisepersubunitofF - actin ( 27 . 6A˚ ) fromfibre diffractionstudies 14 , 33 insteadtocalibratethepixelsize , whichwasthen1 . 12A˚per pixel . Image processing of the cryo - EM data set . As a first quality control , all 1 , 311 frame averages were manually inspected and only 689 images with high filament and ice quality ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) were used for further processing . Frames werealignedandafterwardssummedupusingmotioncorrection 34 . Filamentswere manually selected with helixboxer in SPARX . A total of 109 , 242 segments from 7 , 854filamentswereextractedwithaboxsizeof256pixelsandaboxingdistanceof 29pixels ( overlap , 90 % ) . Thus , the approximatedistancebetweenthem ( , 32A˚ ) slightly exceeded the rise of the helical assembly of actin ( , 27 – 28A˚ ) , as required by the helicon design . The defocus andastigmatismandthe accuracy of both were determined by cter 35 in SPARX . All segments were aligned and classified using reference - free alignment and k - means classification procedures implemented in SPARX ( Extended Data Fig . 1b , i ) . For the initial reconstruction , the data set was binnedtwiceto a pixelsize of 2 . 24A˚ and a box sizeof 128pixels . Weused a cylin - derfilledwithGaussiannoiseasathree - dimensionalinitialtemplateforthehelical refinementandreconstructionin helicon . Afteradjustingthepixelsizeasdescribed above , the helical symmetry parameters converged to a rise per subunit of 27 . 5A˚ andanazimuthalrotationof166 . 4 u . Initially , theentireF - actin – tropomyosinmap wasusedasthereferenceduringthefirstroundsofrefinement , usingthehelicalsym - metryparametersofF - actin . However , tropomyosinspansoversevenactinsubunits and therefore has a symmetry different to that of actin . Nevertheless , because it is divided into seven pseudo - repeating units , each of which binds to a successive actinsubunitalongF - actin , thesymmetryofF - actincouldbeusedforreconstruc - tions of actin - tropomyosin complexes of up to 6A˚ resolution , accepting that the overlap regionoftheNandCterminioftropomyosinwouldnotbediscerniblein thesemaps .

Inthelastrefinementiter - ation , we used only filaments derived from summed up frames with a drift of less than7A˚ , asestimatedinthemotioncorrection 34 stepandwithasufficientcontent of high - resolution information , as determined by cter in SPARX . This yielded a subset of 74 , 228 segments for the final map , which corresponded to , 120 , 000 asymmetric subunits . The segments’ statistics are given in Extended Data Table 1 . Sinceanelectronmicroscopemapofafilamentistruncatedattheedgesofthecubicvolumeofthebox ( here 256 voxels ) , a mask with Gaussian edges must be applied forresolutionestimationtominimizeartefacts . Therefore , Fouriershellcorrelation ( FSC ) analysis was performed within the central area of the volume , resulting in a nominalresolutionof3 . 7A˚ ( FSC 0 . 5 criterion 36 ) fortheF - actincryo - EMdensitymap ( Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . The map of F - actin was then sharpened using a negative b factor of – 50A˚ 2 and filtered to its nominal resolution . Finally , the tropomyosin mapfilteredto6 . 5A˚wasmergedwiththefinalF - actinmaptoobtainamapofthe entire F - actin – tropomyosin complex . We also tried to process tropomyosin separately from F - actin . After alignment of the filaments based on F - actin , we masked out tropomyosin . To find the N - or C - terminal overlap and guarantee the proper alignment of tropomyosin , we used very large boxes to allow tropomyosin to shift by almost its full length and tried to align the molecules . However , this approach did not work . We suspect that the pseudo - repeatsandeventheN / C - terminaloverlapsaretoosimilartoeachother ( at leastincryo - EMrawimages ) , resultinginanimproperalignment . Wearetherefore investigating labelling strategies to solve this problem . ModelbuildingandrefinementofF - actin . ThecentralF - actinsubunit ( chainA ) shows all available contacts to adjacent chains ( B , C , D , E ) and was therefore used for further structural analysis . In a first step , five central subunits ( chains A – F ) of anF - actinmodel ( PDBaccessioncode4A7N ; ref . 8 ) wererigid - bodyfittedintothe electron microscope map , using ‘Fit in Map’ and the map was initially segmen - ted with ‘Split Map’ in Chimera 37 .

The cryo - EMden - sitywas converted to structure factors withthe CCP4programsuite 40 . The model and the map were then used for real space refinement and model building in COOT 41 . After a single iteration of model building of the central F - actin subunit , itspartofthemapwasfurtherusedforaninitialautomaticreciprocalspacerefine - ment usingPHENIX . refine 42 . Since this partwas lesswell resolved inthe N andC terminus , and model building was difficult for a part of the D - loop , we deleted aminoacids1 – 4 , 42 – 50and372 – 375fromthemodel . Owingtothehighreliability of the experimental phases of the cryo - EM map , we were able to apply experi - mental phase restraints during refinement in PHENIX . After refinement the out - put model was again manually refined in COOT using the original cryo - EM map tominimizemodelbias .

Finally , the resulting model was validated using MOLPROBITY 43 ( see data statistics in Extended Data Table 1 ) .

Atomic clashes and stereochemistry were repaired using PHENIX . geometry _ minimization 42 . SincethetropomyosinN / C - terminaloverlap is not fully understood 45 , we reduced the model to the five central pseudo - repeats . Owing to the limited resolution of the cryo - EM density in the region of tropomy - osin , we avoided interpretation of tropomyosin on the single - amino - acid level . We used the refined actin pentamer and the modelled tropomyosin to recon - structafullfilamentforvisualizationoftheactin – tropomyosininteraction ( Fig . 4 ) . ThefilamentwasprotonatedusingH 11 46 atdifferentpHvaluesandtheelectrostatic coulomb potential of the filament surface was calculated to range from 2 10kcal mol 2 1 to 1 10kcalmol 2 1 in Chimera ( Fig . 4b , Extended Data Fig . 8h ) .

The residue is depicted in both states ( G - actin and F - actin ) . f – h , Binding of new G - actin ( yellow , PDB accessioncode3EL2 ; ref . 59 ) atthe pointedendofF - actin ( green ) isinitiatedbyinitialintrastrandbinding ( g ) of SD3 ofG - actin toSD4 ofF - actin at the pointed end and interstrand binding of SD4 to SD3 ( h ) , respectively . Again , the main interstrand contacts are available before the transition of G - actin ( yellow ) to F - actin ( SD1 and SD2 in cyan , SD3 and SD4 in red ) . i , During binding to F - actin the transition from G - actin to F - actin is initiated by an induced fit of the F - actin D - loop to the hydrophobic cleft of the newly bound G - actin . This leads to a pulling down of the central b - sheet of SD3 of G - actin . j , The b - sheet is thereby straightened and pushes up two adjacent helices of SD1 . k , The slight dislocation of these helices is transmitted to other regionsof SD1 and thereby emphasized . This leads to a global rotation of SD1 , which results in a considerable rotation of SD2 by an angle of 20 u and a closure of the nucleotide binding cleft ( Fig . 3 ; see Supplementary Video 3 ) .

Tropomyosin was rotated by 180 u and shifted to the right to allow a better view of the F - actin – tropomyosin interface . Difference maps of the glutardialdehyde – bare F - actin and the tropomyosin – bare F - actin map are shown on the F - actin surface at pH7 . 5 ( left ) and pH4 . 0 ( middle ) , respectively .

Tropomyosin ( yellow , A - state ) , F - actin ( green ) . b – d , Initial weak binding of myosin ( magenta , PDB accession code 1LKX ; ref . 66 ) to the F - actin – tropomyosin filament in the absence of troponin . Most of the myosin binding sites on F - actin are not occupied by tropomyosin and only loop 4 and the cardiomyopathy loop are sterically hindered from binding to the F - actin filament ( b ) . Actin - induced closure of the 50 - kDa cleft of myosin ( c ) results in a strong binding of myosin and tropomyosin moves to its M - state position ( blue ) ( d ) . e – g , F - actin – tropomyosin – myosin complex in the rigor state ( PDB accession code 4A7H ; ref . 8 ) . Myosin is shown in red . h – l , There are two possible ways for the transition of tropomyosin from the A - state to the M - state . Tropomyosin either rolls ( i , j ) or slides ( k , l ) from one to the other position . Rolling would involve an azimuthal rotation of , 16 u with respect to the F - actin axis ( inset of j ) and a left - handed rotation of , 70 u ( indicated by solid arrows ) or a right - handedrotationof , 110 u ( indicated bydottedarrows ) with respect to its own axis ( i , j ) . Sliding would imply not only an azimuthal shift of , 12A˚ ( indicated by white arrows in k ) , but also a tremendous shift of a half - tropomyosinrepeat ( thatis , , 35A˚ ) alongtheF - actinfilament ( k , l ) . Theradius to the filament axis would bepreserved in both situations . The inset of l depicts the vectors for a shifting transition of tropomyosin : an azimuthal and longitudinal shift of 12A˚ and 35A˚ , resulting in an overall shift of 37A˚ .
