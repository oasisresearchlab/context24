Every year there appear reports on the involvement of new pro(cid:2) teins into the process of actin regulation [ 1 , 2 ] . Actin(cid:2) binding proteins associated with the plasma mem(cid:2) brane may modify it , causing formation of filopodia [ 3 ] . This process is controlled by domains of actin(cid:2) binding proteins called BAR ( Bin , Amphiphysin , Rvs ) and I(cid:2)BAR ( invert(cid:2)BAR ) . Mutations in genes encod(cid:2) ing a BAR domain may lead to various nervous and autoimmune diseases [ 4 ] . A classical BAR domain presents as a dimer in which each monomer consists of three bent antiparallel α (cid:2)helices [ 5 ] . By its outer sur(cid:2) face the BAR domain interacts with the membrane at the expense of electrostatic interactions and also anchoring of the N(cid:2)terminal peptides in the lipid layer [ 6 ] . The results of a recent cryoelectron(cid:2)microscopic study of the interaction of isolated F(cid:2)BAR domains with a lipid membrane [ 7 ] have shown that the domains are capable of self(cid:2)organization . Single domains interact with each other by their distal ends and sides to form a continuous helical «coating» on the surface of the lipid cylinder . The protein IRSp53 ( Insulin Receptor Substrate p53 ) takes part in regulating cell movement , modulat(cid:2) ing the formation of lamellopodia [ 8 , 9 ] . At the N(cid:2)end it contains an I(cid:2)BAR domain and at the C(cid:2)end , an actin(cid:2)binding domain . Expression of an isolated I(cid:2)BAR domain in cells causes a significant increase in Editor’s Note : I certify that this text exactly reproduces all factual statements and largely conveys the phrasing and style of the original Russian publication . A . G . the number of filopodia [ 10 , 11 ] , but the full(cid:2)sized protein is inhibited in cells . A crystal structure of I(cid:2)BAR has been published [ 12 , 13 ] , but the mecha(cid:2) nisms of its binding with the membrane is unknown . As a rule , it is supposed that I(cid:2)BAR interacts with the membrane from the inside by its convex side , by anal(cid:2) ogy to the BAR domain , which surrounds the tube from the outside by its concave side . This , however , does not correspond to the results obtained upon studying the interaction of isolated I(cid:2)BAR domains with polar lipids in vitro [ 9 , 14 ] . In these works it has been shown that a series of positively charged amino acids ( K108 , K130 , K147 , K171 ) of the I(cid:2)BAR domain of IRSp53 draw up into a «lipid binding line» positioned at a significant distance from the convex surface [ 14 , 15 ] . The tasks of the given work included a study of the mechanisms and dynamics of membrane deformation upon interaction with the I(cid:2)BAR domain of protein IRSp53 by the methods of coarse(cid:2)grained and all(cid:2) atom molecular dynamics ( MD ) . DATA AND METHODS In the case of all(cid:2)atom approximation , the study was conducted in the Gromacs 3 . 3 . 1 package [ 16 ] with the OPS(cid:2)AA force field [ 17 ] . Use was made of the fol(cid:2) lowing protocol : (cid:2) step , 2 fs ; (cid:2) trajectory , 10 ns ; (cid:2) Berendsen barostat ; (cid:2) barostat pressure , 1 bar normal to and 30 bar along the membrane ; MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS A Molecular Dynamics Study of the Interaction between Domain I(cid:2)BAR of the IRSp53 Protein and Negatively Charged Membranes O .

It has been shown that the I(cid:2)BAR domain does not interact with neutral lipids but induces bending of the synthetic membrane rich in negatively charged phospholipids . Clustering of charged lipids on the sur(cid:2) face of the membrane at the sites of its interaction with the protein has been observed . This indicates that the interaction of I(cid:2)BAR with negatively charged lipids is of electrostatic and hydrophobic nature .

In the case of coarse(cid:2)grained MD , use was made of the MARTINI force field [ 18 ] and the following pro(cid:2) tocol : (cid:2) step , 40 fs ; (cid:2) trajectory , 500 ns ; (cid:2) Berendsen barostat ; (cid:2) barostat pressure , 1 bar ; (cid:2) cutoff radius for Coulomb and van der Waals interactions , 1 . 2 nm ; (cid:2) permittivity , 15 ; (cid:2) Berendsen thermostat ; (cid:2) thermostat temperature , 325 K . Model lipid bilayers consisted of 448 molecules of phosphatidylcholine lipids . For a neutral membrane , only palmitoyloleyl phosphatidylcholine ( P О PC ) was used ; for a negatively charged membrane , one layer was supplemented with phosphoinositide ( 4 , 5 ) phosphati(cid:2) dylcholine ( PIP ( 4 , 5 ) PC ) at a ratio 1 PIP ( 4 , 5 ) PC : 4 POPC . The crystal structure of the I(cid:2)BAR domain of IRSp53 was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank ( code 1Y2O [ 9 ] ) . I(cid:2)BAR was placed 0 . 4 nm above the membrane surface in three positions : conventional , with C(cid:2)ends directed away from the membrane ( sys(cid:2) tem 1 ) ; I(cid:2)BAR facing the membrane by the «lipid binding line» ( system 2 ) ; and C(cid:2)ends towards the membrane ( system 3 ) . Results were visualized using scilab ( http : / / www . scilab . org ) and VMD ( http : / / www . ks . uiuc . edu / Research / vmd ) . RESULTS Interaction of I(cid:2)BAR with nonpolar membrane . No interaction was observed within 25 ns of simulation ; the domain did not approach the membrane surface and did not penetrate the lipid head region . Interaction of I(cid:2)BAR with polar membrane . All(cid:2) atom MD . Interaction was observed as soon as in 4 ns of simulation . In 10 ns the distal ends of the dimer sub(cid:2) merged into the lipid head region ( Fig . 1c ) . Coarse(cid:2)grained MD . In system 1 ( C(cid:2)ends away form membrane ) in 25 ns of simulation one distal end of the domain entered the lipid head region ( Fig . 2a ) . The symmetrical distal end began interacting with membrane in 50 ns but did not submerge into the lipid bilayer throughout the trajectory . The first deforma(cid:2) tion of the membrane was noted in 85 ns , however the membrane bend was unstable , and 50 % of the time the membrane remained flat . Further the protein turned relative to the membrane about its long axis and lay on its side . As a result , in 500 ns one of the domains was lying on the membrane surface ( Fig . 3a ) , and the fol(cid:2) K147 K147 K147 K147 ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) Fig . 1 .
