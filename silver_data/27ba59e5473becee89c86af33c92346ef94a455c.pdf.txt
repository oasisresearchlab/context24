Russian Federation ~ D ~ partment of Biophysics , Biological Faculty , Moscow State University , Moscow , Russian Federation Received 24 October 1994 ; revised 30 January 1995 ; accepted 13 February 1995 Abstract The technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to measure the lateral mobility of membrane integral proteins in reticulocyte plasma membranes which were treated to modify the ' fluid ' lipid or immobilized protein fractions , hence increasing the relative prevalence of obstacles to protein lateral motion . This was achieved by either : ( 1 ) treating the plasma membranes with phospholipase A 2 followed by extraction of the hydrolysis products using fatty - acid - free bovine serum albumin , resulting in a decrease in the membrane ' fluid ' lipid portion ; or ( 2 ) preincubating the plasma membranes with polylysines , resulting in plasma membrane protein aggregation and immobilization . As the prevalence of obstacles to lateral motion increased in plasma membranes through the treatments described above , the mobility of the membrane integral proteins diminished . Experimental results for the dependence of protein mobility on the prevalence of obstacles to lateral motion were compared to theoretical data in order to verify the applicability of the percolation theory to reticulocyte plasma membranes . The influence of a decrease in the ' fluid ' lipid and an increase in the immobilized membrane protein fractions upon the hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity has been studied as well , As the ' solid ' lipid and immobilized membrane protein fractions decreased , both the hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and the fraction of / 3 - adrenergic receptors with high affinity to hormone diminished . It was shown that this correlation can be caused by a decrease in membrane fraction accessible to the movement of the interacting proteins of the adenylate cyclase complex . Hormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase is discussed in terms of the percolation theory .

This conception of the plasma membrane has led to the description of the plasma membrane as a percolation medium 6 - 10 . The extended branched pathway of motion for mobile particles in such a medium forms the so - called percolation cluster ; that part of the cluster which has no branches and dead ends is called the percolation cluster backbone 11 . At a certain obstacle concentration ( the percolation threshold ) , the percolation cluster disappears and diffusion over long - range distances becomes impossible . Extensive theoretical analysis of membrane models based on percolation theory had been undertaken by Saxton ( see 6 , 12 ) . It is known 13 that the lateral mobility of membrane components determines various cellular processes . Changes in the plasma membrane , a medium for the lateral mem - 178 O . M . Zakharoca et aL / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1236 ( 1995 ) 177 - 184 brane component motion , can affect the rate of lateral diffusion and , as a consequence , the rate of biological processes dependent on this movement 7 - 9 , 14 - 19 . Ex - amining theoretically the plasma membrane as a percola - tion medium , Saxton 6 , we 7 - 9 , 17 , 20 and Thompson et al . 10 predicted how differences in membrane structure could influence biochemical reactions within the mem - brane . The adenylate cyclase system can serve as an example of a membrane localized enzyme complex , whose activity may be determined by membrane protein lateral motion 7 - 9 , 13 , l 8 , 20 - 24 . Our earlier studies of adenylate cyclase activity 7 - 9 , 17 , 20 yielded experimental evidence supportive of description of the plasma membrane in terms of percolation theory . It was shown , in particular , that the formation of the hormone - / 3 - adrenergic receptor - G ~ - protein ternary complex was in conformity with this theory . New experimental evidence for description of the plasma membrane as a percolation medium is given in the present paper . We changed the portion of ' fluid ' lipids and immo - bilized membrane proteins in reticulocyte plasma mem - brane and investigated an influence of these changes upon mobility characteristics of the integral membrane proteins . It was examined also how hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity depends on these changes in plasma mem - brane . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Reagents and fluorescent probes Fatty - acid - free bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , fluores - cein - 5 - isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - labeled poly ( L - lysine ) ( molecular mass = 18 kDa ) , poly ( L - lysines ) ( molecular masses = 24 . 4 kDa ; 90 kDa ; 140 kDa ; 354 kDa ) , EDTA , 5 - ( 4 , 6 - dichlorotriazinyl ) aminofluorescein ( DTAF ) , L - iso - proterenol , caffeine , DL - propranolol , cAMP , ATP , creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphate were from Sigma ; / 3 - mercaptoethanol , EGTA were from Serva ; 1 - ( 4 , 6 - pro - pyl3H ) dihydroalprenolol ( 3 HDHA ) and ce - 32 PATP were from Amersham ; bee venom phospholipase A 2 was from Calbiochem . 2 . 2 . Preparation of reticulocyte plasma membrane Reticulocytosis in Wistar male rats weighing 200 - 250 g was induced by hypodermic injection of phenylhydrazine - HC1 25 . Percentage of reticulocytosis was not less than 95 % . Isolation of reticulocyte plasma membranes was as described previously 17 . 2 . 3 . Treatment of plasma membranes with phospholipase A2 Hydrolysis of plasma membrane phospholipids was car - ried out at 24 ° C for 15 min in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 25 mM CaC12 , and 0 . 04 - 2 . 00 / zg / ml phospholipase A 2 17 . Hydrolysis was stopped by adding EGTA ( up to 5 raM ) . The membranes were incubated with fatty - acid - free BSA for 10 min at 24 ° C in order to extract the hydrolysis products . The membranes were then washed by centrifugation ( three times ) in 50 mM Tris - HCl buffer ( pH 7 . 6 ) containing 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM / 3 - mercapto - ethanol at 4 ° C . 2 . 4 . Determination of ' fluid ' lipid fraction The ' fluid ' lipid fraction was determined using 2 , 2 , 6 , 6 - tetramethylpiperidine - l - oxyl ( TEMPO ) according to Mc - Connell ' s method with modifications 26 , 27 . From the ESR spectra of a spin probe , TEMPO , added to the membranes in the presence of chromooxalate the fraction of TEMPO dissolved in ' fluid ' lipids was determined . Changes in the ' fluid ' lipid fraction were calculated after normalization of the data according to the formula : ( treat - ment / control - 1 ) . 100 % 8 . 2 . 5 . Preparations for FRAP experiments Reticulocyte plasma membranes were labeled with DTAF according to Sheetz et al . , whereby greater than 90 % of the label were linked to the major integral protein of erythrocyte plasma membranes Band 3 28 . Plasma membranes were then sedimented at 1000 X g for 5 min upon a fatty - acid - free slide covered with collagen film in buffer I ( 50 mM Tris - HC1 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 6 ) . In the case of polylysine treatment , plasma membranes were incubated at 25°C for 15 min in the polylysine solution in buffer I . Sedimented membranes were covered by a cover slip . The distance between the cover slip and the slide was fixed with hydrophobic films to avoid membrane deforma - tions . The preparation was then sealed with paraffin . 2 . 6 . Measurements of the integral protein lateral mobility by FRAP technique The technique of fluorescence recovery after photo - bleaching 29 was used to measure the lateral diffusion coefficient of integral membrane proteins . The computer - controlled setup used consisted of a microscope ( Reichert ) and 3W argon ion laser ( LGN - 402 , Ukraine ) tuned to 488 nm . A focusing lens and 100 × objective ( N . A . 1 . 32 ) were used to achieve a laser beam radius of 1 . 7 ~ m with a photobleaching beam intensity of 200 W / cm 2 . After photobleaching , attenuation of the laser beam intensity to the reduced measuring level was achieved using an electro - magnet operated switch system 30 . The measurement parameters were : bleach duration and half - time for fluores - cence recovery , 500 ms and 3 - 20 rain ; time interval between measurement points , 20 s ; increment of time interval , 700 ms ; depth of bleaching , 30 - 70 % . Fluores - cence from the object was registered by a photomultiplier O . M . Zakharova et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1236 ( 1995 ) 177 - 184 179 ( FEU - 79 , Russian Federation ) . Curve - fitting to the fluores - cence recovery data was performed as described 31 to calculate mobility parameters . The temperature at the ob - ject was maintained at 25 . 0 + 0 . 1°C using heating stage and objective . 2 . 7 . Determination of adenylate cyclase activity The incubation mixture for the assay of adenylate cy - clase activity contained 50 mM Tris - HC1 , pH 7 . 6 , 5 mM MgCI 2 , 0 . 5 mM 32pATP ( 20 - 40 cpm / pmol ) , 0 . 75 mM cAMP , 5 mM caffeine , 10 mM creatine phosphate , 1 . 0 mg / ml creatine phosphokinase , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 1 mM / 3 - mercaptoethanol , and 20 - 30 tzg of reticulocyte plasma membranes . The incubation was carried out for 15 min at 25 ° C . The resulting cAMP was purified on columns with alumina as described 32 . 2 . 8 . 3HDHA binding to plasma membranes 3HDHA ( 0 . 1 - 10 - 9 - 8 . 10 - 9 M ) binding to plasma membranes ( 40 - 60 / ~ g of protein ) was performed in 200 ~ 1 volume of 40 mM Tris - HC1 buffer , pH 7 . 6 , with 10 0 . 8 ¢ , q o ~ ~ , ~ , 0 . 6 04 I - 60 I I I - 40 - 20 0 80 0 " ~ 60 2 : . ~ 40 a . 20 0 ~ o B I I I I - 60 - 40 - 20 0 Changes in ' fluid ' lipid fraction ( % ) Fig . 1 .

The parameters were estimated by the deforming polyhedron method 35 . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Lateral mobility of integral proteins in reticulocyte plasma membranes Analysis of a spin probe TEMPO spectra from ESR measurements on reticulocyte plasma membranes showed that the treatment of plasma membranes by phospholipase 180 O . M . Zakharova et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1236 ( 1995 ) 177 - 184 A 2 with subsequent extraction of hydrolysis products by fatty - acid - free BSA led to a decrease in the ' fluid ' lipid fraction and , as a consequence , to an increase in the relative fraction of ' solid ' lipids in plasma membranes 17 . We have previously shown 7 - 9 , 17 , 20 that such a treatment does not lead to a damage of membrane proteins such as adenylate cyclase , G ~ - protein , or / 3 - adrenergic receptor . This may indicate that the native structure of the membrane proteins and , as a consequence , the ability for the lateral motion does not change . FRAP was used to measure the lateral diffusion characteristics of integral membrane proteins in rat reticulocyte plasma membranes labeled with DTAF . The results of the experiments showed that decreasing the ' fluid ' lipid fraction by 56 . 3 % from control membranes induced by treatment of plasma mem - branes with phospholipase A 2 resulted in a decrease in the lateral diffusion coefficient and the mobile fraction of the v L ~ 100 ~ 75 ~ 5o ~ 25 A - 60 - 40 - 20 0 Changes in ' fluid ' lipid fraction ( % ) v : _ 100 75 ~ a 50 " ~ z5 , 20 B I I I I 30 40 50 60 Immobile protein fraction ( % ) Fig . 3 . Dependence of adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by L - isoprote - renol on the variation of the ' fluid ' lipid fraction ( A ) and on the variation of the immobile protein fraction ( B ) in rat reticulocyte plasma mem - branes . The ' fluid ' lipid fraction in plasma membranes was changed as in Fig . 1 . The immobile protein fraction was changed by preincubating of the plasma membranes with polylysine ( molecular mass = 24 . 4 kDa , 10 - 610 - 1 M ) calculated from the results of FRAP experiments as ( 100 % - % mobile fraction ) . 100 % adenylate cyclase activity correspond to the activity of control membranes with 10 - 4 M isoproterenol + 10 - 4 M GTP . The adenylate cyclase activity was measured in the presence of 10 - 4 M of isoproterenol + 10 - 4 M GTP .

Using optical and electron microscopy , it was shown 36 , 37 that incubation of red blood cell plasma mem - branes with polylysines led to protein aggregation in the plasma membrane resulting from the interaction of polyly - sine with negatively charged domains of the proteins 38 . Results of FRAP measurements of the mobility of DTAF - labeled proteins in plasma membranes showed that as the polylysine concentration increased , so did the fraction of immobilized proteins , resulting in the reduction in the lateral diffusion coefficient of mobile proteins ( Fig . 2 ) . FRAP measurements of the mobility of the FITC - labeled polylysine ( molecular mass = 18 kDa , 10 - 3 M ) on the plasma membrane surface indicated that the polylysine was immobile ( lateral diffusion coefficient less than 10 - 13 cm2 / s ) . This demonstrates the lack of mobility of mem - brane proteins aggregated by polylysines . Clearly , a de - crease in the lateral diffusion coefficient cannot be ex - plained by an increase in the size of mobile protein particles through aggregation by polylysines . 3 . 2 . Adenylate cyclase activity in reticulocyte plasma mem - brane Our studies of hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and Rn in plasma membranes with altered ' fluid ' lipid fraction indicated that treatment of plasma mem - branes with phospholipase A 2 with subsequent reducing the ' fluid ' lipid fraction by 62 % from control membranes O .

It was shown also that the dissociation constant and the total binding site number for the / 3 - adrenergic receptor antago - nist 3HDHA were unaltered in plasma membranes with reduced ' fluid ' lipid fraction , and both / 3 - adrenergic recep - tor and Gs - protein and Gs - protein and catalytic subunit capabilities for interaction were unchanged 7 , 8 , 17 , 20 . Studies of the adenylate cyclase activity in reticulocyte plasma membranes preincubated with polylysine showed that as the fraction of the DTAF - labeled immobilized proteins measured by FRAP increased , both hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and R H decreased ( Figs . 3B and 5A ) . 3I - IDHA binding to fl - adrenergic receptors in plasma membranes preincubated with polyly - sine did not differ from that in control plasma membranes ( Table 1 ) .

The inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity by direct interactions of polylysine with the proteins of the adeny - late cyclase complex can be discounted , since the number of reactive groups of polylysines with different molecular weight does not change at constant residue concentration . 4 . Discussion The functions f ( x ) , used in percolation theory to de - scribe diffusion in a medium possess the form 11 : ) ~ f ( x ) ~ ( x - x c ( 1 ) where x is the space fraction accessible for protein move - ment ; x c the critical x value ( at x < x c there is no percolation cluster ) ; and to a critical exponent . In particular , for two - dimensional space ( from 11 , 39 - 43 ) : D ( x ) Ot ( X - Xc ) ~ , / z = 1 . 1604 ( 2a ) PB ( x ) ~ ( x - - Xc ) ¢ ~ , ft , = 0 . 5 ( 2b ) where D ( x ) , the diffusion coefficient along the whole backbone of the percolation cluster ; PB ( X ) , the probability that a particular point belongs to the backbone of the percolation cluster ; / x = 1 . 1604 and / 3 B = 0 . 5 , the theoreti - cal values of the critical exponents . For our investigation we used the model of continuous two - dimensional percolation , which is suitable to describe the plasma membrane 6 , and appropriate for this model x ~ value of 0 . 675 43 , 44 was chosen . In accordance with percolation theory , the critical exponent is independent of the chosen model and , therefore independent of xc , and is determined only by space dimensionality 11 , 42 . x can be calculated from the experimental values of ' fluid ' lipid and immobilized fractions using simple trans - formations ( see Appendix ) . To obtain dimensionless value 182 O . M . Zakharot , a et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1236 ( 1995 ) 177 - 184 D * the experimental value of protein lateral diffusion coefficient D was normalized by Dma x ( the lateral diffu - sion coefficient in the medium without obstacles , recalcu - lated by extrapolation of the plot of experimental depen - dence of D on x to line x = 1 ) . Plotting the dependence of D * on ( x - x c ) in logarithmic coordinates made it possible to find a slope of the experimental line ( Fig . 6 ) . A slope of the plot obtained from the results of the experi - ments on membranes with the altered ' fluid ' lipid fraction is equal to 1 . 09 + 0 . 51 ( Fig . 6A ) and in case of membranes with the altered immobilized proteins fraction slope is equal to 1 . 04 + 0 . 08 ( Fig . 6B ) . In both cases the values of the critical exponent obtained experimentally were in ac - cordance with the theoretical one ( see Eq . ( 2a ) ) regardless of the type of obstacles . This indicates the validity of describing the mobility of integral membrane proteins without considering the nature of the obstacles . 0 log ( M ) - 0 . 4 - 0 . 8 i slope = 0 . 51±0 . 04 f I I - 1 . 8 - 1 . 1 - 0 . 4 log ( x - Xc ) Fig . 7 .

It is possible to verify whether the expression ( 2b ) is satisfied for the plasma membrane . Let us imagine that there is a percolation cluster on the membrane surface spot examined under the laser beam . The fluorescence recovery on the bleached spot will be a result of diffusion of labeled proteins mainly in the percolation cluster backbone . Our experiments with repeat bleaching of the same spot ( curve not shown ) demonstrated that the mobile fraction de - creased not more than by 5 . 3 % ; this result means that the contribution from other parts of the percolation cluster and / or finite clusters at the edge of the bleached spot is small enough ( not more than 5 . 3 % ) . Therefore , the value of the mobile protein fraction determined from FRAP measurements in plasma membranes with the altered ' fluid ' lipid fraction will correspond to PB ( x ) . The slope from the plot of the mobile protein fraction dependence on ( x - x c ) , plotted in logarithmic coordinates , 0 . 51 _ + 0 . 04 , ( Fig . 7 ) coincided with the theoretical value with good accuracy ( see Eq . ( 2b ) ) . ( In the case of the experiments using polylysines , a part of the mobile labeled proteins interacts with the polylysine molecules and becomes immobilized ; therefore , the value of mobile fraction in this case will not correspond to PB ( x ) ) . Thus , expressions ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) are satisfied for proteins diffusing in plasma membranes . This may indicate that protein mobility in the plasma membrane and the plasma membrane itself may be described in terms of the percolation theory . Our results here show that the hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity decreased with both a decreased ' fluid ' lipid fraction and an increased immobile protein fraction ( Fig . 3 ) . Reducing the ' fluid ' lipid fraction and increasing the immobile protein fraction also led to a decrease in the percentage of fl - adrenergic receptors with high affinity to hormone ( Figs . 4A and 5A ) , It is known 46 that transition of fl - adrenergic receptor from a low to a high affinity state induced by formation of the hormone - receptor - G ~ - protein ternary complex is a prerequisite stage O . M . Zakharova et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1236 ( 1995 ) 177 - 184 183 in the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by hormone . Since both the value of the R H fraction and the hormone - stimu - lated adenylate cyclase activity approached zero at the same values of the immobilized protein fraction and re - duced the ' fluid ' lipid fraction , it can be assumed that R H formation is a limiting step in adenylate cyclase inhibition in plasma membranes pretreated with phospholipase A 2 or preincubated with polylysines . 3HDHA binding and other experiments ( 7 - 9 , 17 and Table l ) showed that decreased hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was not due to changes in the functional activity of the proteins of the adenylate cyclase complex in the case of phospholipase A 2 treated plasma membranes ; and could not be exclusively explained by loss of the protein function in case of plasma membranes preincubated with polylysines ( see Results ) . It was shown above that the lateral diffusion of the integral proteins diminished in plasma membranes treated with phospholipase A 2 or preincubated with polylysines . It was shown also 20 , 24 , 47 that at least a part of the compo - nents of the adenylate cyclase complex are laterally mobile in plasma membranes and that the hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity may be determined by lateral mobility of these components 13 , 17 , 18 , 21 - 23 . It can be supposed that an increase in the immobile protein fraction and the relative increase in the portion of ' solid ' lipids may result in a slowing - down of the lateral mobility of these proteins . As a cons ; equence of this , the probability of formation of the ternary complex resulting from the inter - action of the laterally mobile components may be reduced followed by a decrease in adenylate cyclase activity ( see also Ref . 19 for results for reduced vasopressin - stimu - lated adenylate cyclase activity through reducing vaso - pressin receptor lateral raotion ) . It was shown above that the plasma membrane could be considered as a percolation medium and that protein diffu - sion in this medium could be described in terms of the percolation theory . We have tried to apply the percolation theory to describe the adenylate cyclase complex . Express - ing the immobile proteirt fraction and the portion of ' fluid ' lipids through x ( the membrane surface fraction accessible for protein movement ) ( see Appendix ) , one can note that as the membrane surface accessible for motion was re - duced , the hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity approached zero ( Fig . 8 ) . Such a correlation is in agree - ment with the one theoretically predicted for the chemical reaction whose rate is determined by lateral diffusion of its components in a percolation medium 6 . In the preceding paper 17 , it was evaluated : RH Ot D ( x ) / x ( 3a ) and if the percolation processes take place in plasma membranes : R Hot ( x - xc ) U / x ( 3b ) We replotted the data of Figs . 4A and 5A using coordi - nates log ( R H • x ) vs . log ( x - xc ) . The straight lines can be 100 " ~ 75 50 e - " - ~ 25 < O 0 O 0 o 0 I I I I 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 X Fig . 8 . Dependence of adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by L - isoprote - renol on the plasma membrane fraction accessible for protein movement , x , in rat reticulocyte plasma membranes with varied , O , immobile protein fraction , O , ' fluid ' lipid fraction . The raw data come from Fig . 3 . drawn through the experimental points for the plasma membranes both treated with phospholipase and preincu - bated with polylysine ( Figs . 4B and 5B , accordingly ) . In both cases the slopes of the experimental lines are close to the theoretical value of / z = 1 . 1604 ( see Eq . ( 2a ) ) . This accordance may evidence that the proteins of the adenylate cyclase complex ( the / 3 - receptors and / or Gcproteins ) be - have as the particles diffusing in the percolation cluster . As shown recently 1 , plasma membranes may be heterogeneous , what may greatly influence the percolation properties 6 - 10 , 17 , 20 , through , for example , the pres - ence of proteins immobilized by cytoskeleton etc . It is known 48 , 49 that the level of the hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is higher in rat reticulocytes than in erythrocytes , and that extensive cytoskeletal changes accompany the differentiation of reticulocyte to erythro - cyte . It can be assumed that an increase in the number of membrane proteins immobilized by the cytoskeleton and , as a consequence , changes in the percolation properties of plasma membranes during erythrocyte maturation may be responsible for the sharp decrease in hormone - stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in mature erythrocytes .

Appendix 1 Let us assume that plasma membranes can be divided into two classes according to accessibility to protein move - ment : ( 1 ) those which are accessible to protein movement 184 O . M . Zakharova et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1236 ( 1995 ) 177 - 184 and may be called ' fluid ' , their total area is F ; and ( 2 ) those which can be considered as ' obstacles ' , their total area is S . S consists of immobilized proteins and so - called ' solid ' lipids , i . e . , lipids in the gel phase . Experimentally estimated changes in the ' fluid ' lipid fraction , AF , and in the ' obstacles ' , AS , are related with F and S as follows : ~ IF = ( F - Fo ) / F o ( 4a ) AS = ( S - So ) / S o ( 4b ) where F o - a total area of ' fluid ' parcels and S o - a total area occupied by ' obstacles ' before any membrane treat - ment . Let F ~ and S c be the threshold values of F and S , accordingly ( at x = Xc ) , hence AF ~ = ( F c - Fo ) / F o ( 5a ) aSc = - So ) / So ( 5b ) x can be determined from F and S as follows : x = F / ( S + F ) ( 6a ) x c = Fc / ( S ~ + F ~ ) ( 6b ) Let x ~ = 0 . 675 ( theoretical value 43 , 44 ) , AFc = - 0 . 62 ( fitted earlier from our data by minimization of the sum of squares of residuals in the double logarithmic plot 17 ) and the total area occupied by membrane protein is 0 . 253 45 ; then taking into consideration these numeral values and from Eqs . ( 4a - 6b ) one can obtain for x in case of plasma membranes with the altered ' fluid ' lipid fraction : x = ( 1 + AF ) / ( 1 . 183 + AF ) ( 7a ) and in the case of plasma membranes with the altered immobile protein fraction : x = 0 . 845 - 0 . 155 .
