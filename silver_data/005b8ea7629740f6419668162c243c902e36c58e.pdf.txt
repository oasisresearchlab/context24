We prepared four vector combinations ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Table 2 ) . The Y1 combination had six factors ( OCT3 / 4 , SOX2 , KLF4 , c - MYC , LIN28 and NANOG ) in three epi - somal plasmids . The Y2 combination contained an additional TP53 ( also known as p53 ) shRNA in one of the three plasmids . We replaced c - MYC and NANOG with MYCL1 ( also known as L - MYC ) in the Y1 and Y2 combinations , respectively , to yield the Y3 and Y4 combinations ( Fig . 1b ) . We electroporated these seven combinations of episomal vectors ( Y1 – Y4 or T1 – T3 ) into three human dermal fibroblast ( HDF ) lines and two dental pulp cell lines on day 0 ( Fig . 1c ) . We trypsinized transfected cells on day 7 and reseeded them onto feeder layers . We maintained the cells in embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) medium , and small cell colonies became visible ~ 2 weeks after transfection . We counted the number of colonies with a flat human ESC – like morphology and non - ESC - like colonies around day 30 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The Y4 combination resulted in significantly ( P < 0 . 05 ) more iPSC colonies than did any of T1 – T3 combinations ( Fig . 1d ) . In addition to these five parental cell lines , we obtained iPSC colonies from seven additional HDF lines with the Y4 combination of factors ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . We expanded ESC - like colonies derived with the Y4 combina - tion for additional experiments . The majority of the colonies were expandable and exhibited a cellular morphology similar to that of human ESCs , characterized by large nuclei and scant cytoplasm ( Fig . 2a , b ) . We termed these episomal plasmid vector - derived iPSCs ‘pla - iPSCs’ . Ten of eleven clones we analyzed were karyotypi - cally normal ( Supplementary Fig . 2 and Supplementary Table 4 ) . Short tandem repeat analyses confirmed that pla - iPSC clones were derived from HDFs and dental pulp cells ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Reverse transcription – PCR ( RT - PCR ) analyses revealed that pla - iPSC clones expressed pluripotent stem cell markers , such as OCT3 / 4 , SOX2 , NANOG and DPPA5 , at levels comparable to those in ESCs and retrovirus - derived iPSC clones ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Figs . 3a , 4 and 5 ) . Global gene expression profiles also showed that pla - iPSC clones were similar to ESC and retro - iPSC clones ( Supplementary Fig . 6 and Supplementary Table 6 ) . The DNA methylation levels of CpG sites in the promoter region of NANOG were high in parental HDFs and dental pulp cells but were low in pla - iPSCs and ESCs ( Fig . 2d ) . To examine whether episomal vectors persisted in pla - iPSCs , first we transfected an episomal vector encoding enhanced GFP a more efficient method to generate integration - free human iPs cells Keisuke Okita 1 , Yasuko Matsumura 1 , Yoshiko Sato 1 , Aki Okada 1 , Asuka Morizane 1 , 2 , Satoshi Okamoto 3 , Hyenjong Hong 1 , Masato Nakagawa 1 , Koji Tanabe 1 , Ken - ichi Tezuka 4 , Toshiyuki Shibata 5 , Takahiro Kunisada 4 , Masayo Takahashi 1 , 3 , Jun Takahashi 1 , 2 , Hiroh Saji 6 & Shinya Yamanaka 1 , 7 – 9 We report a simple method , using p53 suppression and nontransforming L - myc , to generate human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPscs ) with episomal plasmid vectors . We generated human iPscs from multiple donors , including two putative human leukocyte antigen ( hLa ) - homozygous donors who match ~ 20 % of the Japanese population at major hLa loci ; most iPscs are integrated transgene - free . this method may provide iPscs suitable for autologous and allologous stem - cell therapy in the future . Genomic integration of transgenes increases the risk of tumor formation and mortality in chimeric and progeny mice derived from induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) 1 . Integration - free human iPSCs have been generated using several methods , including adenovirus 2 , Sendai virus 3 , the piggyBac system 4 , minicircle vector 5 , episomal vectors 6 , direct protein delivery 7 and synthesized mRNA 8 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . However , reprogramming efficiency using integration - free methods is impractically low in most cases . Direct delivery of proteins or RNA is labor - intensive , requiring repeated delivery of the repro - gramming factors . Modifying Sendai virus vectors or preparing synthesized RNA are technically demanding . In the original report describing episomal plasmid vectors for reprogramming , the authors used seven factors , including POU5F1 ( also known as OCT3 / 4 ) , SOX2 , KLF4 , MYC ( also known as c - MYC ) , NANOG , LIN28A ( also known as LIN28 ) and SV40 large T antigen ( SV40LT ) , in three different vector com - binations 6 ( T1 – T3 combinations ; Fig . 1a and Supplementary Table 2 ) .

Sixty - eight percent of the cells were fluorescent 1 week after trans - fection ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . However , the signal quickly decreased thereafter , and only 2 . 4 % of cells were fluorescent 4 weeks after electroporation . Then we estimated the copy numbers of the episomal vectors in established pla - iPSC clones . We designed a PCR primer pair for EBNA - 1 sequence derived from Epstein - Barr virus to calculate the copy numbers of the episomal vectors and another primer pair for the endogenous FBXO15 locus to estimate the cell number . We detected ~ 200 copies of the episomal vectors per cell 6 d after transfection ( Fig . 2e and Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . In contrast , we detected no EBNA - 1 DNA in five of seven clones tested at passages 11 – 20 ( ~ 80 – 120 d after transfection ) . The remaining two clones contained ~ 0 . 001 and 2 copies , respectively . The latter clone likely had integrated the plasmid into a chromosome .

We examined the differentiation potential of pla - iPSCs in vivo . Injection of pla - iPSCs into the testes of immunodeficient mice yielded tumors within 3 months . Histological examination con - firmed that these tumors were teratomas and contained tissues of all three germ layers , including neural epithelium , cartilage and gut - like epithelium ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . We carried out directed differentiation of the pla - iPSCs into dopaminergic neurons in vitro ( Online Methods ) . RT - PCR detected upregulation of SOX1 , a marker of immature neural cells , and down - regulation of OCT3 / 4 12 d after induction ( Supplementary Fig . 9a ) . Immunostaining showed that the majority of cells expressed Nestin after 29 d , with some cells still proliferating and expressed Ki67 ( Supplementary Fig . 9b – e ) . Clusters of Nestin - expressing cells expressed PAX6 , and more mature cell clusters expressed tyrosine hydroxylase , a marker of dopaminergic neurons ( Supplementary Fig . 9f , g ) . Tyrosine hydroxylase – expressing cells localized with the neural markers Tuj1 and MAP2ab , and the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2 ( Fig . 2f – h and Supplementary Fig . 9h – l ) . Therefore , pla - iPSCs have the potential to differenti - ate into dopaminergic neurons . We also examined whether pla - iPSC clones differentiated into retinal pigment epithelial cells using a modified stromal cell – derived inducing activity method ( Online Methods ) . Five of six pla - iPSC clones developed pigmented cell clusters after 30 d in conditioning medium of mouse PA6 stromal cells . The clusters grew and exhibited a squamous and hexagonal morphology , char - acteristic of retinal pigment epithelial cells ( Fig . 2i , j ) . We examined the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) types of our dental pulp - derived iPSC lines . In a previous study only one HLA type had been detected in two dental pulp lines by a PCR – reverse sequence – specific oligonucleotide probe ( rSSOP ) proto - col 11 : line DP74 had been typed as HLA - A * 24 , – ; HLA - B * 52 , – ; HLA - DRB1 * 15 , – , and line DP94 as HLA - A * 11 , – ; HLA - B * 15 , – ; HLA - DRB1 * 04 , – ( ‘ – ’ means no other allele was detected ; Supplementary Table 7 ) . We also typed these lines with two addi - tional analyses . A PCR - rSSOP protocol optimized for the Japanese population typed line DP74 and its progeny iPSC lines ( 454E - 2 and 457C - 1 ) as HLA - A * 24 : 02 , – ; HLA - B * 52 : 01 , – ; HLA - DRB1 * 15 : 02 , – , and typed DP94 and its progeny iPSC line ( 453F - 2 ) as HLA - A * 11 : 01 , – ; HLA - B * 15 : 01 , – ; HLA - DRB1 * 04 : 06 , – . Sequence - based typing showed that the types of DP74 and DP94 were HLA - A * 24 : 02 : 01 , – ; HLA - B * 52 : 01 : 01 , – ; HLA - DRB1 * 15 : 02 : 01 , – and HLA - A * 11 : 01 : 01 , – ; HLA - B * 15 : 01 : 01 , – ; HLA - DRB1 * 04 : 06 : 01 , – , respectively . The families of the donors of the two dental pulp lines could not be typed because the lines were established in an anonymous way . Therefore , it is not possible to formally con - clude that these donors are homozygous for the HLA haplotypes . Nevertheless , the fact that three independent analyses detected only one type in each donor is indicative of homozygosity . According to the HLA Laboratory database , frequencies of HLA - A * 24 : 02 ; HLA - B * 52 : 01 ; HLA - DRB1 * 15 : 02 and HLA - A * 11 : 01 ; HLA - B * 15 : 01 ; HLA - DRB1 * 04 : 06 haplotypes in the Japanese population are 8 . 5 % and 1 . 3 % , respectively ( http : / / www . hla . or . jp / hapro _ e / top . html ; Supplementary Table 8 ) . Theoretically , iPSCs established from these two individuals match ~ 20 % of all the combinations of 2 , 117 haplotypes in Japanese population . Indeed , pla - iPSC lines derived from lines DP74 and DP94 match 32 of 107 donors 11 at the three HLA loci ( HLA - A , HLA - B and HLA - DR ) with the two - digit specification ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . Others previously estimated that iPSC lines with 50 unique HLA homozygous haplotypes would match ~ 90 % of the Japanese population at the HLA - A , HLA - B and HLA - DRB1 loci with two - digit specification 12 . We performed a similar estimation with four - digit specification using the HLA Laboratory database and found that 50 unique HLA - homozygous donors would cover ~ 73 % of the Japanese population ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Table 8 ) . Approximately 75 and 140 unique donors would be needed to cover ~ 80 % and 90 % , respectively . It would be necessary to type ~ 37 , 000 , ~ 64 , 000 and ~ 160 , 000 individuals , respectively , to iden - tify these 50 , 75 and 140 donors ( Fig . 3b ) . Allografts using HLA - homozygous iPSCs may provide a thera - peutic alternative to autologous grafts , for cases in which trans - plant is likely to be needed soon after injury ; furthermore , they allow for the advance selection of safe clones 13 . The beneficial effects of matching at major HLA loci are well documented in renal transplantation 14 , 15 , although recipients of allografts derived from HLA - homozygous iPSCs would still need immunosuppres - sants after transplantation because of other HLA antigens , non - HLA antigens and immunity by natural killer cells . We report a simple , non - integrative method for reprogram - ming human cells . The increased efficiency and the use of non - transforming Myc should be useful to generate iPSCs from many donors , such as individuals with disease . The approach may also prove beneficial for generating human iPSCs for use in autologous and allologous stem cell therapy . methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper at http : / / www . nature . com / naturemethods / .

Human fibroblasts HDF1419 , HDF1388 , HDF1429 , HDF1377 , HDF1437 and HDF1554 were purchased from Cell Applications , and TIG121 , TIG120 , TIG114 and TIG107 were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources . Human fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM ( Nacalai Tesque ) supplemented with 10 % FCS ( Invitrogen ) . Human dental pulp ( DP ) cells were established from human third molars as described previously 11 and were maintained in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium ( MSCGM ; Lonza ) . Human ESC lines ( KhES - 1 and KhES - 3 ) were obtained from Kyoto University . H1 and H9 were from WiCell Research Institute . Mouse embryonic fibro - blasts ( MEFs ) were isolated from embryonic day 13 . 5 embryos of C57BL / 6 mice . All mice used in this study were bred and killed appropriately following code of ethics of animal research com - mittee in Kyoto University . MEF and mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line ( SNL ) cells 16 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 7 % ( v / v ) FCS , 2 mM L - glutamine and 50 units and 50 mg ml −1 penicillin and streptomycin , respectively . Established iPSCs and ESCs were maintained on mitomycin C – treated SNL cells in pri - mate ESC medium ( ReproCELL ) containing 4 ng ml −1 of bFGF ( Wako ) as described previously 17 . Vector construction . Efficient transgene expression was achieved by inserting the woodchuck hepatitis post - transcriptional regula - tory element ( WPRE ) upstream of the polyadenylation signal of pCX - EGFP 18 . The episomal cassette was transferred from pCEP4 ( Invitrogen ) . The EBNA - 1 sequence ( EcoRI and MfeI sites ) was flanked by two loxP sequences , and the loxP – EBNA - 1 – loxP – OriP cassette was then digested with BamHI and BglII and inserted into the BamHI site of pCX - EGFP containing the WPRE . This episomal vector was designated pCXLE - EGFP . Human cDNAs encoding OCT3 / 4 , SOX2 , KLF4 , c - MYC , L - MYC , NANOG and LIN28 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pCR2 . 1 ( Invitrogen ) . The translation termination codons of SOX2 , c - MYC , L - MYC or LIN28 were replaced with a BamHI site and then were also cloned into pCR2 . 1 . The cDNAs without a translation termination codon were thereafter ligated with 2A self - cleavage sequences in pBS - 2A 19 with appropriate restriction enzymes to generate pBS – cDNA – 2A . c - MYC – 2A was digested with NotI and BspHI and was ligated into the NotI and NcoI sites of pBS - LIN28 - 2A in the same reading frame to generate the c - MYC – LIN28 – NANOG cassette . These cDNA – 2A or c - MYC – 2A – LIN28 – 2A constructs were then ligated to another cDNA or NANOG in pCR2 . 1 with the translation termination codon in the same reading frame using appropriate restriction enzymes . These cDNA - 2A - cDNA - stop or c - MYC – 2A – LIN28 – 2A – NANOG – stop constructs were then inserted into the EcoRI site of pCXLE - EGFP . pCXLE - hOCT3 / 4 - shp53 was constructed by inserting an shRNA expression cassette for p53 , driven by the mouse U6 promoter , into the BamHI site of pCXLE - hOCT3 / 4 . The pCXLE - Fbx15 - cont2 was generated by inserting the FBXO15 cDNA into pCXLE - EGFP . Episomal vectors described previously 6 were obtained from Addgene ( 20922 – 20927 ) . Generation of iPSCs with episomal vectors . HDF and DP cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % FBS and mesen - chymal stem cell growth medium ( MSCGM ) , respectively . Three micrograms of expression plasmid mixtures were electroporated into 6 × 10 5 HDF or DP cells with Microporator ( Invitrogen ) with a 100 - µ l kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The plasmid mixtures used in the experiments are shown in Supplementary Table 2 . Conditions used were 1 , 650 V , 10 ms , 3 time pulses for HDF , and 1 , 800 V , 20 ms , 1 time pulse for DP cells . The cells were trypsinized 7 d after transduction , and 1 × 10 5 cells were re - plated onto 100 - mm dishes covered with an SNL or MEF feeder layer . The culture medium was replaced the next day with primate ESC medium containing bFGF . The colonies were counted 26 – 32 d after plating , and those colonies similar to human ESCs were selected for further cultivation and evalu - ation . The pla - iPSC clones used in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table 9 . Characterization of pla - iPSC clones . Isolation of total RNA , RT - PCR of marker gene expression , DNA microarray , bisulfite genomic sequencing and teratoma formation were performed as previously described 17 . The primer sequences used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table 10 . The chromosomal G - band analyses were performed at the Nihon Gene Research Laboratories . Short tandem repeat analyses were performed at Bex Co . ; briefly , genomic DNAs were amplified by the PowerPlex 16 system ( Promega ) and were then analyzed with an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer and the GeneMapper v3 . 5 software pro - gram ( Applied Biosystems ) . Differentiation of pla - iPSC clones into dopaminergic neurons was performed using the serum - free culture of embryoid body – like aggregates ( SFEB ) method com - bined with double SMAD inhibition by a BMP antagonist and an Activin / Nodal inhibitor as described elsewhere 20 . In vitro directed differentiation into retinal pigment epithelial cells was performed with the modified stromal cell – derived inducing activ - ity method 21 , 22 . Briefly , pla - iPSCs were collected with trypsin and collagenase IV , and were treated with inhibitors for WNT and Nodal signaling under serum - free conditions . The cells were then maintained in PA6 - conditioning medium for maturation . Episomal copy - number detection . Cells cultured in 60 - mm dishes were collected with a cell scraper after removing feeder cells by treatment with dissociation solution consisting of 0 . 25 % trypsin , 1 mg ml −1 collagenase , 1 mM CaCl 2 and 20 % KSR in PBS . The cells were then placed into tubes and centrifuged , and the cell pellets were lysed with 200 µ l of lysis solution , contain - ing 1× Ex Taq buffer ( Takara ) and 167 µ g ml −1 proteinase K . The lysates were incubated at 55 °C for 3 h , and proteinase K was inactivated at 95 °C . The lysates were used for quantitative PCR analysis . The pCXLE - hFbx15 - cont2 plasmid was used to gener - ate a standard curve to determine the correlation between copy number and threshold cycle ( Ct ) values for FBXO15 or EBNA - 1 . Then the copy number of FBXO15 and EBNA - 1 in each iPSC sample was estimated from the observed Ct values . The cell number in each reaction was estimated by dividing the estimated copy number of FBXO15 by two since each cell had two FBXO15 alleles . One reaction included up to 1 . 2 × 10 4 cells . The total copy number of EBNA - 1 was measured in ~ 5 × 10 4 cells by repeating six or seven reactions . HLA typing and estimation of coverage . HLA typing of 107 DP cell lines was performed with the PCR - reverse sequence specific oligonucleotide probe ( rSSOP ) method using LABType SSO © 201 1 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . nature methods doi : 10 . 1038 / nmeth . 1591 ( One lambda ) at Repro Cell 23 . Additional HLA typing was performed with PCR - rSSOP using WAKFlow ( Wakunaga Pharmaceutical ) at HLA Laboratory . We performed pedigree study of 4 , 743 Japanese families ( 17 , 325 members ) and identified 2 , 117 haplotypes , including interlocus recombinant haplotypes , which were detected in family studies . The haplotype frequency was calculated by direct counting on the parents in the families . Sequence - based typing was performed with AlleleSEQR ( Atria Genetics ) at Mitsubishi Chemical Medience Corporation . To estimate coverage of Japanese population by HLA homozygous donors , we first calculated the frequencies of all possible combinations of the 2 , 117 HLA haplotypes shown in Supplementary Table 8 . Haplotype combinations that can be cov - ered by a given homozygous donor were then identified and their frequencies were added to estimate coverage by the homozygous donor . When one HLA - A , HLA - B , HLA - DRB1 heterozygous indi - vidual was covered by multiple homozygous donors , we counted only once to avoid overestimation . The expected number ( EN ) of each homozygous haplotype at a given population size ( PS ) was first calculated as ; EN = ( haplo - type frequency ) 2 × PS . EN ( if EN < 1 ) or 1 was then summed for each homozygous haplotype to estimate the expected numbers of unique HLA haplotype donors at the given PS . Statistical analyses . Data are shown as the mean ± s . d . Statistical significance among multiple groups was evaluated with the Steel - Dwass test . 16 . McMahon , A . P . & Bradley , A .
