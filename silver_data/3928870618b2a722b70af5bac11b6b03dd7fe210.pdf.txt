The fibrotic scar that comprises a dense extracellular matrix is thought to originate from meningeal cells surrounding the CNS . However , using transgenic mice , we demonstrate that perivascular collagen1 (cid:1) 1 cells are the main source of the cellular composition of the fibrotic scar after contusive spinal cord injury in which the dura remains intact . Using genetic lineage tracing , light sheet fluorescent microscopy , and antigenic profiling , we identify collagen1 (cid:1) 1 cells as perivascular fibroblasts that are distinct from pericytes . Our results identify collagen1 (cid:1) 1 cells as a novel source of the fibrotic scar after spinal cord injury and shift the focus from the meninges to the vasculature during scar formation . Introduction The scar tissue that forms at the spinal cord injury ( SCI ) site can be categorized into “glial” and “fibrotic” components . The glial scar often refers to the astrogliotic region that surrounds the central core and prevents non - CNS cells ( such as leukocytes ) from invading the CNS parenchyma . The glial scar has been in - tensely studied for its role in inhibition of axon regeneration ( Silver and Miller , 2004 ) . However , much less is known about the fibrotic scar , which is typically characterized by excess deposition of extracellular matrix molecules . Most of our current knowledge comes from in vitro coculture assays of primary astrocytes and meningeal fibroblasts that mimic the astrocyte – fibroblast border that forms after SCI in vivo ( Rudge and Silver , 1990 ; Shearer and Fawcett , 2001 ) . When neurons are placed on top of this cocul - ture , they prefer to grow over astrocytes and avoid fibroblasts , indicating that fibroblasts are less permissive or inhibitory to axon growth . In vivo studies on the fibrotic scar have mostly used penetrat - ing injuries that tear the dura and permit the invasion of menin - geal fibroblasts into the lesion . However , penetrating injuries do not mimic most of the human cases of SCI , which are character - ized as contusions that leave the dura intact . This raises the ques - tion of whether fibroblasts are even present at the injury site after clinically relevant contusion injuries and are even worth consid - ering as therapeutic targets to promote axon regeneration . Previ - ous electron microscope studies of rodent spinal cord contusion sites have alluded to the presence of fibroblast or fibroblast - like cells ( Zhang et al . , 2005 ; Kostyk et al . , 2008 ) , but there are almost no reports on the origin , prevalence , or the spatiotemporal dis - tribution of fibroblasts in the contusion site . One reason for this gap in knowledge is the technical difficulty of identifying proper markers of fibroblasts . The commonly used marker fibronectin typically labels extracellular matrix molecules rather than cell bodies , and other cells , such as macrophages , may also secrete fibronectin at the injury site ( Yamauchi et al . , 1987 ) . Indeed , it is widely accepted that there is not a single marker for all fibroblasts ( Kalluri and Zeisberg , 2006 ) . To overcome this technical hurdle , we used transgenic mice in which GFP is ex - pressed under the control of the collagen 1 (cid:1) 1 promoter ( Col1 (cid:1) 1 - GFP mice ) ( Yata et al . , 2003 ) . We describe , for the first time , a robust distribution of fibroblasts in the injury site after contusive SCI and conclude that these fibroblasts are of perivascular origin .

Brains and spinal cords were harvested and prepared for immunohistochemistry as previously described ( Lee et al . , 2010a ) . Serial sagittal cryosections ( 10 (cid:2) m ) of the injury site were immunostained for (cid:1) - smooth muscle actin ( (cid:1) SMA ) - Cy3 ( Sigma ) , CD11b ( Invitrogen ) , CD13 ( Abcam ) , CD45 ( eBioscience ) , F4 / 80 ( AbD Se - rotec ) , fibronectin ( Millipore ) , Glut1 ( Millipore ) , GFAP ( Invitrogen ) , GFP ( Abcam ) , laminin ( Sigma ) , nestin ( Aves Laboratories ) , NG2 ( Millipore ) , Olig2 ( Millipore ) , PDGFR - (cid:3) ( Abcam ) , PECAM / CD31 ( BD Biosciences ) , RFP ( Rockland ) , or5 - hydroxytryptamine ( Immunostar ) ( Leeetal . , 2010a ) .

To label spinal cord vascula - ture , Col1 (cid:1) 1 - GFP mice were transcardially perfused with DyLight - 594 - labeled Lycopersi - con esculentum lectin ( LEL ) ( Vector Laborato - ries ) as previously described ( Jahrling et al . , 2009 ) . Spinal cords were postfixed in 4 % PFA and then washed in PBS ( both overnight at 4°C ) . The dura was removed and the spinal cord cut into 8 - mm - long segment centered at T8 . Samples were incubated ( on a rotating shaker at room temperature ) in 50 % , 80 % , 100 % tetrahydrofuran ( Sigma 401757 ) each for 2 h , and then 100 % tetrahydrofuran over - night . The next day , samples were transferred to BABB solution ( 1 : 2 ratio of benzyl alcohol , Sigma , 305197 ; and benzyl benzoate , Sigma , B6630 ) for 2 . 5 – 3 h . After clearing , samples were immediately imaged by LSFM ( Ultrami - croscope , LaVision BioTec ) . Image analysis and 3D reconstructions were performed using Imaris ( Bitplane ) , and consecutive serial view movies were created in ImageJ ( National Insti - tutes of Health ) . Results Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) cells in the uninjured spinal cord To obtain an accurate view of the Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells and blood vessels in the uninjured spi - nal cord , we labeled the endothelial cells of the circulatory system ( via transcardial per - fusion ) with LEL . After making the spinal cord transparent , we used LSFM to obtain optical sections of the entire specimen . 3D reconstructions ( Fig . 1 K – M ) as well as con - secutive serial views of the image stack ( 400 – 500 optical sections ) clearly demon - strate that Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells reside along blood vessels throughout the spinal cord . The most visible regions were along large - diameter vessels . Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells were also visible along arterioles and venules with a minor population observed on mi - crovessels . To obtain a more detailed histological profile of the Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells , we performed immunohistochemistry on spinal cord sections using antibodies against smooth muscle ( (cid:1) SMA ) and basal lamina ( laminin ) ; 60 . 9 (cid:4) 5 . 1 % of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells were found surrounding smooth muscle cells indicative of arterioles with laminin expression on their abluminal surfaces . To further identify the cellular identity of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells , we obtained an antigenic profile using a comprehensive list of cellu - lar markers as listed in Figure 1 . Because pericytes are the proto - typical perivascular cells , we focused on whether Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells expressed pericyte markers . Although there are many pericyte markers referenced in the literature , no single markers are con - sidered specific for this cell type ( Armulik et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , wechosecolabelingofCD13 / NG2orCD13 / nestinasourpericyte markers based on previous immunoelectron microscopy studies that identified CD13 ( Kunz et al . , 1994 ) , NG2 ( Schlingemann et al . , 1990 ) , and nestin ( Alliot et al . , 1999 ) as antigens expressed by pericytes . Although 78 . 7 % of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells expressed CD13 , none expressed NG2 or nestin ( Fig . 1 A – E ) . PDGFR - (cid:3) and (cid:1) SMA are also commonly used markers of pericytes ( Armulik et al . , 2011 ) . No Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells expressed (cid:1) SMA . Although most Figure1 .

Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells did not express markers for endothelial cells ( PECAM , Glut1 ) , macrophages / microglia ( CD11b , F4 / 80 ) , fibrocytes / leukocytes ( CD45 ) , or neural cells ( GFAP , Olig2 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Therefore , based on the histological loca - tion of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells preferentially around larger - diameter blood vessels and their antigenic profile , our results indicate that Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are predominantly perivascular fibroblasts in the uninjured spinal cord . Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) cells after SCI To investigate the contribution of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells to the formation of the fibrotic scar after SCI , we performed mid - thoracic contu - sive SCI on Col1 (cid:1) 1 - GFP mice and histologically assessed the injury site at multiple time points after injury . At 3 d postinjury ( dpi ) , the injury site contained mostly necrotic tissue , with Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells still mostly attached to blood vessels ( Fig . 2 A ) . Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells started to accumulate at the injury site 4 dpi , and by day 5 there was a visible mass of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells at the injury epicenter ( Fig . 2 B ) . The density of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells reached its peak at 7 d when the entire injury site ( GFAP - negative area ) was homoge - Figure2 .

The size of the fibrotic scar decreased by 14 d , with Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells displaying a heteroge - neous distribution pattern ; the peripheral border adjacent to the astroglial scar contained a dense rim of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells ( Fig . 2 D , F ) , whereas the inner region contained Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells that were inter - spersed between macrophages at a much lower density . Although this general distribution pattern continued at 28 and 56 dpi ( Fig . 2 G , H ) , the morphology of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells continues to change over this period to become increasingly elongated . In addition , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells formed a tight border with astrocytes and appeared to form a barrier against serotonin axon regeneration ( Fig . 2 L , M ) . To compare contusive and penetrating injuries in the Col1 (cid:1) 1 - GFP mice , we performed a dorsal hemisection at the same mid - thoracic level . Similar to contusive SCI , at 3 d after dorsal hemisection , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells were not observed at the injury site ( Fig . 2 I ) . At 14 d after dorsal hemisection , in contrast to the contusive SCI described above , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells completely filled the fibrotic scar and seemed to form a contin - uous fibrous tissue with the overlying dura , suggesting a meningeal origin ( Fig . 2 J ) . Fibronectin expression closely matched the distribution of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells in both types of injuries ( Fig . 2 S – V ) . Laminin expression was strong around the peripheral rim of the injury site after contu - sion , whereas it was expressed throughout the injury site after dorsal hemisection ( Fig . 2 O – R ) . Therefore , althoughthetimecourse of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells accumulating at the injury site seems to be similar between the two in - jury types , the cellular distribution of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells in the fibrotic scar after con - tusiveSCI , inwhichtheduraremainsintact , issignificantlydifferentcomparedwithdor - sal hemisection SCI in which the dura is torn . To identify possible changes in the cel - lular identity of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells after con - tusive SCI , we used the same list of antibodies described above to obtain an antigenic profile in the injured spinal cord . At all acute and chronic time points examined , all Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells expressed PDGFR - (cid:3) ( 100 % ) ( Fig . 3 F , H ) and most PDGFR - (cid:3) cells in the fibrotic scar were Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) ( Fig . 2 E ) , indicating that Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are the predominant PDGFR - (cid:3) - expressing cells at the fibrotic scar . Whereas 78 . 7 % of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells ex - pressedCD13intheuninjuredspinalcord ( Fig . 1 ) , this number decreased to 26 . 9 % in the fibrotic scar by 14 dpi ( Fig . 3 K , L ) , indicating that either Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells at the fibrotic scar lost CD13 antigenicity and / or other cell types that do not express CD13 contributed to the Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cell popula - tion in the fibrotic scar . Also , although Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells did not express (cid:1) SMA be - fore injury , some of them transiently ex - pressed (cid:1) SMA acutely after injury ; this coexpression peaked at 5 dpi and de - creased by 7 dpi , reaching (cid:6) 3 . 09 % by 14 dpi ( Fig . 3 ) . However , as intheuninjuredspinalcord , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cellsdidnotexpressmark - ers for any other cells types , including microglia / macrophages , astrocytes , and endothelial cells ( Fig . 3 ) , which makes it un - likely that other cell types began to express Col1 (cid:1) 1 in response to injury or that cells in addition to these Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) fibroblasts ( and macrophages ) contribute to the fibrotic scar . Similar ex - pression pattern of CD13 and aSMA was observed after dorsal hemisection ( Fig . 3 P – T ) . Therefore , our results indicate that Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells begin to enter the injury site at (cid:6) 3 – 4 d after SCI and are a major component of the fibrotic scar . In addition , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are the predominant PDGFR - (cid:3) - expressing cells in the fibrotic scar . Figure3 . AntigenicprofileofCol1 (cid:1) 1 - GFP (cid:1) cellsat14dpi .

Neurosci . , August21 , 2013 • 33 ( 34 ) : 13882 – 13887 • 13885 Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) cells originate mostly from blood vessels after SCI Although Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are present around blood vessels in the uninjured spi - nal cord , they are also present in the dura as meningeal fibroblasts ( data not shown ) . Because the dura remains intact after a contusive SCI , we reasoned that the source of the Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells in the fibrotic scar was most likely the spinal vasculature rather than the dura . In addition , SCI in which the dura is torn ( e . g . , dorsal he - misection ) leads to a completely different scar phenotype ( Fig . 2 I , J ) . To further in - vestigate the source of the Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells , we used LSFM to obtain serial optical sec - tions of the entire injury site from Col1 (cid:1) 1 - GFP mice with blood vessels la - beled with LEL ( Supplemental Videos 3 and 4 ) . Serial sections through the entire widthofthespinalcordrevealedCol1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells unwrapping from blood vessels and forming a trail toward the fibrotic scar . In addition , the major vascular branches from the anterior and posterior vessels were always observed enclosing the fi - brotic scar along the dense peripheral rim of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells ( Fig . 2 N ) . Trails of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells were also observed from the dorsal overlying dura . Although most of these cells were associated with blood vessels originating from the dura , many cells just underneath the dura appeared similar to Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells after dorsal he - misection , indicating that this minor pop - ulation could have migrated through micro - tears and / or degraded basement membrane . Therefore , our results indicate that , although the dorsal - most portion of the fibrotic scar could be derived from meningeal Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells , most of the fibrotic scar is Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells of perivascular origin . Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) fibroblasts are distinct from NG2 (cid:2) pericytes Although collagen expression is normally unique to fibroblasts , pericytes have also been reported to express collagen after injury inotherorgans ( Linetal . , 2008 ) . Toinvestigatewhethercollagen - expressing pericytes contribute to the population of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells in the fibrotic scar , we performed genetic fate mapping using NG2 - CreER / Rosa26 - tdTomato mice bred to Col1 (cid:1) 1 - GFP mice ( referred as Col1 (cid:1) 1 / NG2 mice ) . Although NG2 (cid:1) cells are com - monly referred to as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells ( OPCs ) , NG2 also labels pericytes . In these mutant mice , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are always labeled green ( with GFP ) , whereas NG2 (cid:1) OPCs and pericytes are labeled red ( with tdTomato ) only upon tamoxifen administration . Pericytes can be distinguished from OPCs by their tubular structure around blood vessels that are easily iden - tified from 3D reconstructions . Because tamoxifen - labeled NG2 cells and their entire progeny are permanently labeled with tdTomato , any NG2 (cid:1) cells that also express Col1 (cid:1) 1 should be colabeled with red and green fluores - cence . However , it should be noted that only a fraction of NG2 (cid:1) pericytes are labeled in these transgenic mice ( Zhu et al . , 2011 ) . Before performing SCI , we waited 7 d after the last tamoxifen injection to allow tamoxifen to be fully metabolized and cleared from the body so that recombination would not be induced in - advertently in other cell types . Red perivascular NG2 (cid:1) cells were found mostly around microvessels that typically branched from larger vessels surrounded by green Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells ( Fig . 4 A – H ) . This is consistent with our observation above that Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are preferentially around larger vessels and not on microvessels where pericytes are typically located . To determine whether NG2 (cid:1) pericytes express Col1 (cid:1) 1 in the fibrotic scar after SCI , we performed contusive SCI on Col1 (cid:1) 1 / NG2 mice and analyzed the injury site at 7 ( data not shown ) and 14 d after SCI ( Fig . 4 I – L ) . Whereas Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells filled the injury epicenter as described above , NG2 (cid:1) cells were located mostly outside of this region , indicating that NG2 (cid:1) OPCs and pericytes are not a major source of the fibrotic scar . Importantly , red NG2 (cid:1) cells did not express Col1 (cid:1) 1 ( green fluorescence ) with very rare exceptions . Therefore , our results indicate that NG2 (cid:1) pericytes do not make significant contributions to the Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cell population that forms the fibrotic scar after SCI . Discussion The cellular origin of the fibrotic scar after CNS injury has tradi - tionallybeenthoughttobemeningealcellssurroundingthebrainandspinalcord . Therefore , virtually all previous investigations of the fibrotic scar after SCI have used models of penetrating inju - ries in vivo or primary cultures of meningeal cells in vitro . How - ever , our data indicate an alternative source of the fibrotic scar , namely , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells that reside in the perivascular space in the spinal cord . Even after a contusive model of SCI where the dura Figure 4 . Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are distinct from NG2 (cid:1) pericytes before and after injury . A , D , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells surround larger - diameter arterioles with NG2 (cid:1) pericytes ( red ) along smaller microvessels . A – C , NG2 (cid:1) cells are also present as stellate cells . NG2 (cid:1) cells are always encircled by Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells ( E – H ; blue represents DAPI ) when present in overlapping regions . At 14 dpi ( n (cid:2) 3 , I – L ) , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) and NG2 (cid:1) cells that have migrated to the injury site occupy distinct regions , with Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells occupying injury epicenter and NG2 (cid:1) cells in the surrounding region .

Interestingly , thereisadelayofseveraldaysbefore a significant number of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells start to accumulate at the injury site , and these cells continue to alter their spatial distribution pattern through the first 2 weeks after injury . Consistent with previ - ous descriptions of the fibrotic scar , Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells form a distinct boundary with the astroglial scar ( Bundesen et al . , 2003 ) and appear as a barrier to axon regeneration . What is the cellular identity of these perivascular Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells ? We focused on perivascular fibroblasts and pericytes as the most likely candidates for the identity of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells and used multiple experimental strategies to address this question . Using LSFM and a comprehensive list of antibodies , we determined that Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are mostly PDGFR - (cid:3) (cid:1) / CD13 (cid:1) cells that are lo - cated preferentially around larger - diameter blood vessels in the normal spinal cord . Also , we performed genetic fate mapping studies using Col1 (cid:1) 1 / NG2 transgenic reporter mice to determine that NG2 (cid:1) pericytes do not express Col1 (cid:1) 1 after SCI . Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are around larger - diameter blood vessels , whereas NG2 (cid:1) pericytes are located mostly around capillaries that branch from Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) vessels . Together , our data indicate that Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells display characteristics of perivascular fibroblasts and not peri - cytes . However , it is important to note that our transgenic mice may label only a subset of all Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells . A recent study reported GLAST (cid:1) pericytes to be the source of the fibrotic scar after a penetrating SCI ( Goritz et al . , 2011 ) . Both pericytes and fibroblasts are loosely defined cell types , thereby making the distinction between the two inherently difficult ( Krueger and Bechmann , 2010 ) . Goritz et al . ( 2011 ) described two types of pericytes , type A and B , that responded differently to injury . Type A pericytes , but not type B pericytes that were lo - cated adluminally , were the GLAST (cid:1) cells that contributed to the fibrotic scar . This raises the possibility that our Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells are the GLAST (cid:1) type A cells , whereas adluminal cells , such as our NG2 (cid:1) pericytes , are the type B cells . Future studies are necessary to address this possibility . Nevertheless , our results indicate that Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) perivascularcellsarethemainsourceofthefibroticscar and are consistent with the idea that the perivascular “niche” is an important source of the fibrotic scar ( Goritz et al . , 2011 ) . An interesting observation was that it took (cid:6) 5 d for Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells to significantly accumulate at the injury site . This was also true after a penetrating injury , suggesting that this is an active process by the Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells instead of simply being the result of shearing and invagination of the meninges from the injury . What are the molecular cue ( s ) that direct Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells to the center of the lesion ? One possibility is that attractive cues from cells within the fibrotic scar , such as infiltrating immune cells , could be the mechanism by which Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells accumulate at the lesion core . In support of this hypothesis , previous studies have demon - strated that monocyte infiltration and TGF - (cid:3) production peak at (cid:6) 5 – 7 d after injury , which coincides with the large accumulation of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells in our studies ( Donnelly and Popovich , 2008 ) . In conclusion , we demonstrate that the Col1 (cid:1) 1 - GFP transgenic mouse is a novel in vivo model of fibrotic scar formation after SCI . Our data indicate that the fibrotic scar that forms in mice after both contusive and penetrating SCI is predominantly composed of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells that migrate to the injury site from a perivascular sourceviaadynamictemporospatialprocess . Althoughwecurrently lack a definitive antigenic marker for fibroblasts , we provide strong evidence that the presence of Col1 (cid:1) 1 (cid:1) cells on larger - diameter bloodvesselscoupledwiththeirPDGFR - (cid:3) (cid:1) / CD13 (cid:1) immunoreac - tivity defines these perivascular fibroblasts . A better understanding ofthemolecularsignalsdrawingtheseperivascularfibroblaststothe fibrotic scar could have potential therapeutic implications for pro - moting axon regeneration after SCI .
