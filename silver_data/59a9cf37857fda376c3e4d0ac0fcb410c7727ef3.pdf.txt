Science Policy ( Suny Series In Science , Technology , And Society ) By Daryl E . Chubin , Edward J . Hac . Review Peer review is the principle on which the internal governance system of science has traditionally depended . During the past ten years there has been a great deal of evidence suggesting that that assumption is no longer valid ( if it ever was ) , and that many of the strains in the science - government relationship in the US are traceable either to the assumption itself or to the ways it is implemented . Chubin and Hackett examine the assumption and its implementation from different perspectives and explore its role in the science - government relationship . The authors display the ability to take peer review and use it as a springboard to illuminate a central issue of our time : the relationship between the conduct of science and the larger society in the US in the waning years of this century . The writing itself colorful , interesting , heartfelt is surprising and refreshing . William A .
