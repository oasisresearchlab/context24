De Luca & Kwaku Atuahene - Gima Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross - Functional Collaboration : Examining the Different Routes to Product Innovation Performance There is consensus in the marketing literature that market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration are two fundamental resources for successful product innovation . However , few studies examine the dimensions or characteristics of market knowledge and how and why these resources influence product innovation performance . Drawing on contingency theory and the knowledge - based view of the firm , the authors argue that knowledge integration mechanisms may account for the effects of market knowledge dimensions ( i . e . , breadth , depth , tacitness , and specificity ) and cross - functional collaboration on product innovation performance . They find that market knowledge specificity and cross - functional collaboration affect product innovation performance through knowledge integration mechanisms . In contrast , whereas the effect of market knowledge depth is partially mediated , market knowledge breadth has a direct , unmediated effect on product innovation performance . A test of an alternative moderating perspective shows that the effects of market knowledge depth and cross - functional collaboration on product innovation are negatively moderated by knowledge integration mechanisms . By showing the differential effects of market knowledge dimensions on product innovation performance , the authors provide a more refined understanding of the interplay among market knowledge , its integration , and the firm’s performance in product innovation . The authors also conclude that by overlooking the role of knowledge integration mechanisms , previous research may have provided an overly optimistic view of the value of cross - functional collaboration in product innovation .

T he marketing literature has established that product innovation performance is enhanced by three distinct yet highly complementary factors : market knowledge ( Atuahene - Gima 1995 , 2005 ; Day 1994 ; Li and Calantone 1998 ) , cross - functional collaboration ( e . g . , Griffin and Hauser 1996 ; Kahn and Mentzer 1998 , Song and Parry 1997 ) , and knowledge integration mechanisms ( hereinafter KIMs ; see also Madhavan and Grover 1998 ; Maltz and Kohli 2000 ; Ruekert and Walker 1987 ) . Market knowledge refers to the firm’s knowledge about its customers and com - petitors ( Day 1994 ; Kohli and Jaworski 1990 ; Narver and Slater 1990 ) . Cross - functional collaboration refers to the degree of cooperation and the extent of representation by marketing , research and development ( R & D ) , and other functional units in the product innovation process ( Kahn 1996 ; Li and Calantone 1998 ; Song , Montoya - Weiss , and Schmidt 1997 ) . Knowledge integration mechanisms refer to the formal processes and structures that ensure the capture , analysis , interpretation , and integration of market and other types of knowledge among different functional units within the firm ( Olson , Walker , and Ruekert 1995 ; Zahra , Ireland , and Hitt 2000 ) . The inability of firms to manage the inter - play of these factors lies at the root of many failures in product innovation . For example , Fisher , Maltz , and Jaworski ( 1997 , p . 54 ) report several examples , such as Texas Instruments’s unsuccessful early entry into the desk - top personal computer business , and Hewlett - Packard’s early entry into the laptop business with a technology - oriented 23 - pound laptop . Although the contributions of previous studies are sub - stantial , extant research is lacking in three respects . First , the knowledge - based view ( hereinafter KBV ) of the firm underscores the importance of several different dimensions of market knowledge in product innovation : breadth , depth , specificity , and tacitness ( see Galunic and Rodan 1998 ) . However , although studies in marketing emphasize the importance of broad market knowledge as reflected in the concept of market orientation ( e . g . , Atuahene - Gima 2005 ; Atuahene - Gima , Slater , and Olson 2005 ; Jaworski and Kohli 1993 ; Li and Calantone 1998 ) , there is little or no insight into the relative importance of the different dimen - sions of market knowledge as drivers of product innovation performance . Given the strategic importance of market knowledge , an approach that considers its dimensions and parses out their distinct contributions seems appropriate if 96 / Journal of Marketing , January 2007 we are to examine how market knowledge matters in prod - uct innovation performance . Second , previous studies have focused almost entirely and separately on the effects of market knowledge ( e . g . , Atuahene - Gima 1995 , 2005 ; Li and Calantone 1998 ) and cross - functional collaboration ( e . g . , Kahn 1996 ; Song , Montoya - Weiss , and Schmidt 1997 ) on product innovation outcomes . No detailed explanations are offered as to how and why KIMs matter in these relationships . Yet it is often implicitly assumed that KIMs are salient factors in trans - forming market knowledge and cross - functional activities into product innovation performance ( Griffin and Hauser 1996 ; Hoopes and Postrel 1999 ) . The current state of the lit - erature is lacking and inconsistent because a key assump - tion of the KBV is that it is not knowledge itself but rather its integration among functional units in the firm that drives sustainable competitive advantage ( Grant 1996a ) . For this reason , product innovation is often characterized as a process by which a firm transforms knowledge embedded in cross - functional teams into new products ( Madhavan and Grover 1998 , p . 2 ) . Understanding how market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration are transformed into innovation outcomes through KIMs may shed light on the salience of this factor , which the KBV suggests is at the root of the firm’s competitive advantage . Third , KIMs have traditionally been positioned as mod - erators in the relationship between sources of information and the breadth and depth of the firm’s knowledge ( Zahra , Ireland , and Hitt 2000 ) and between internal and external capabilities and innovation outcomes ( Zahra and Nielsen 2002 ) . Still , there is another view based on structural con - tingency theory that suggests that because knowledge char - acteristics ( e . g . , complexity ) make communication flow dif - ficult among functional units , knowledge becomes a key contingency factor that determines the nature of integration designs ( Thompson 1967 ) . Furthermore , the increased information - processing requirements resulting from inter - dependence among functional units can be met only by cor - responding increases in information - processing capacity through the design of coordination mechanisms ( e . g . , Gal - braith 1973 ; Thompson 1967 ) . This view implies that mar - ket knowledge and cross - functional collaboration affect performance through their effects on the design of KIMs . Extant research in marketing has paid little attention to these different perspectives of the role of KIMs . The moder - ating view suggests that both market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration are inherently valuable such that KIMs determine the strength of their effect on innovation performance . In contrast , the mediating view suggests that these resources are not inherently valuable and that they could affect innovation performance through their effects on KIMs . Because marketing theory has placed consider - able weight on the value of market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration for effective product innovation and because of the widely held belief among managers that value creation involves knowledge integration among func - tions , examining these perspectives is particularly important in advancing this research stream . If the “active role” of KIMs is as a mediator rather than as a moderator or if it plays both mediator and moderator roles , marketing man - agers may need to reevaluate their stance toward the role of market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration per se in product innovation . The findings also shed light on what level of importance researchers and managers need to place on the inherent value of both resources . Figure 1 presents our conceptual model . Theory Development Contingency theory has been one of the major strands of thinking about firms and their structures and strategic actions ( Galbraith 1973 ) . Drazin and Van de Ven ( 1985 ) note two fundamental strands of contingency theory . The first is the “fit - as - mediation” view ( Venkatraman 1989 ) , which posits that managers choose or adopt organizational structures , processes , and strategies that reflect the particu - lar circumstances of their organizations ( Galbraith 1973 , p . 2 ) . In particular , because the organization is essentially an “information - processing network” the objective of organi - zational design is to achieve an efficient correspondence between the information - processing requirements of its strategic contingencies and the information - processing capabilities of its integration mechanisms ( Galbraith 1973 , p . 6 ) . Thus , this theory asserts that by increasing the information - processing demands in the firm , strategic inter - dependence or collaboration among functions dictate the type and degree of organizational integration mechanisms adopted to transfer knowledge within the firm ( see Kumar and Seth 1998 ; Thompson 1967 ) . The KBV suggests that knowledge is sticky ; in other words , its characteristics make it difficult , costly , and uncer - tain to transfer and recombine within the firm ( e . g . , Galunic and Rodan 1998 ; Grant 1996a ; Szulanski 1996 ) . For this reason , Birkinshaw , Nobel , and Ridderstråle ( 2002 ) and others ( e . g . , Germain and Droge 1997 ) argue that the char - acteristics of knowledge complicate the process of transfer by increasing uncertainty and ambiguity and , through this FIGURE 1 Conceptual Model of the Role of Cross - Functional Collaboration , Market Knowledge Dimensions , and KIMs in Product Innovation Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross - Functional Collaboration / 97 complication , increase the likelihood that firms will develop appropriate KIMs . In this view , knowledge characteristics are the fundamental quality to which managers adapt orga - nizational integration structures . Consistent with the KBV , market orientation theory indicates that market knowledge generation is an outside - in process and that firms use inter - nal processes to integrate the acquired knowledge ( Day 1994 ; Jaworski and Kohli 1993 ) . If the KBV tenet is accepted—that is , it is not knowledge per se but rather its integration that affects competitive advantage ( Grant 1991 , 1996b ) —it suggests that KIMs are mediators of the link among market knowledge dimensions , cross - functional col - laboration , and firm performance . The second strand of contingency theory is the inter - active fit argument , or “fit - as - moderation” view ( Venkatra - man 1989 ) . This view proposes that the firm’s performance is attributable to a match between its strategic behaviors and the internal and external environment conditions ( Atuahene - Gima and Murray 2004 ; Zeithaml , Varadarjan , and Zeithaml 1988 ) . This suggests that KIMs moderate the effect of market knowledge and cross - functional collabora - tion on performance . Given the limited attention the mediat - ing view of KIMs has received , we focus on this perspec - tive , though we also empirically examine the moderating view . Effect of Market Knowledge Dimensions on KIMs KIMs . According to Barki and Pinsonneault ( 2005 , p . 166 ) , integration captures the extent to which distinct but interdependent functional units , departments , and resources are coordinated or made to constitute a unified whole . The task of integration or coordinating interfunctional inter - actions is often accomplished by the use of structures and processes ( see Griffin and Hauser 1996 ; Sobek , Liker , and Ward 1998 ) . As Olson , Walker , and Ruekert ( 1995 , p . 49 , emphasis in original ) note , integration mechanisms are “ lat - eral linkage devices or structural coordination mechanisms ” that firms use to coordinate cross - functional interactions ( see also Griffin and Hauser 1996 , p . 203 ) . Fol - lowing Zahra , Ireland , and Hitt ( 2000 , p . 930 ) , we define KIMs as structures and processes , such as the use of docu - mentation , information - sharing meetings , analysis of suc - cessful and failed projects , project reviews , and briefings by external experts and consultants , that ensure the capture , analysis , interpretation , and combination of knowledge within the firm . These structures and processes enable man - agers to determine systematically and understand what has been learned in the product innovation process , to interpret and articulate the importance of the learning , and to devise ways to exploit the knowledge competitively ( Zahra and Nielsen 2002 ) . Market knowledge dimensions . Information about the market environment , particularly about customers and com - petitors , is the source of stimulation for the firm’s knowl - edge ( Day 1994 ; Nonaka 1994 , p . 27 ) and the driver of a market - oriented strategy ( Day and Nedungadi 1994 , p . 32 ) . This implies that a firm that correctly identifies , collects , and uses information about customer and competitor condi - tions is deemed to be knowledgeable about the market . 1 Galunic and Rodan ( 1998 ) identify another characteristic of knowledge , namely , knowledge dispersion . We contend that this characteristic is reflected in the construct of market knowledge breadth because it captures different elements underlying market knowledge ( Turner and Makhija 2006 ) . Knowledge about technology and other environmental properties is important , but only to the extent that it enhances the understanding of customers’ and competitors’ behavior . For this reason , Srinivasan , Lilien , and Ran - gaswamy ( 2002 , p . 49 ) show that the firm’s ability to sense and respond to technology developments per se is different from its market orientation , that is , the ability to sense and respond to customers and competitors . Thus , we define market knowledge as the firm’s knowledge of its customers’ behaviors and needs as well as its competitors’ behavior . We examine the effects of four characteristics of market knowl - edge on KIMs : breadth , depth , tacitness , and specificity . 1 Knowledge breadth refers to the number of different knowledge domains with which the firm is familiar ( Bierly and Chakrabarti 1996 ) . Prabhu , Chandy , and Ellis ( 2005 , p . 116 ) offer a similar view , referring to knowledge breadth as the range of fields over which the firm has knowledge . We define “market knowledge breadth” as the firm’s under - standing of a wide range of diverse customer and competi - tor types and factors that describe them . In other words , a firm is said to have broad market knowledge if it has knowl - edge of a wide variety of current and potential customer segments and competitors and also uses a diverse set of parameters related to customers ( e . g . , needs , behaviors , characteristics ) and competitors ( e . g . , products , markets , strategies ) to describe and evaluate them ( e . g . , Zahra , Ire - land , and Hitt 2000 ) . This concept highlights the broad understanding of customers and competitors that is deeply rooted in the market orientation construct . Firms with a broad knowledge base have a greater potential to recombine different elements of the knowledge to improve opportunity recognition and creative potential ( Kogut and Zander 1992 ) . However , knowledge breadth might hamper knowledge recombination because the high degree of heterogeneity of knowledge elements contributes to the complexity of transfer across functional units ( Galu - nic and Rodan 1998 ) . In contrast , limited market knowledge can be easily disseminated to and internalized by members of different departments . Furthermore , because customer segments and competitors’ strategies change over time , broad market knowledge may involve frequent and numer - ous variations that further increase the difficulties of cross - functional transfer . In addition , when market knowledge is broad , not all of it can be usefully employed in every inno - vation project . Bringing in marginally useful information or leaving out relevant information might be detrimental to performance ( Leonard - Barton 1992 ) . Thus , the increased difficulties in sharing broad knowledge lead managers to develop KIMs to provide the necessary information - processing capacity for the organization . Empirically , Ger - main and Droge ( 1997 ) find that the breadth of the firm’s knowledge about a task is an antecedent to processes for knowledge integration because these processes are the nec - 98 / Journal of Marketing , January 2007 essary mechanisms to combat excessive compartmentaliza - tion of the diverse knowledge . Thus : H 1 : The broader the market knowledge , the greater is the use of knowledge integration mechanisms . Prabhu , Chandy , and Ellis ( 2005 ) describe technical knowledge depth as the amount of within - field knowledge the firm possesses . McEvily and Chakravarthy ( 2002 ) also argue that complex knowledge reflects the degree to which knowledge consists of many different , unique , and inter - dependent elements , such that knowing how one element works reveals little about how the different elements work together . Consequently , we define “market knowledge depth” as the level of sophistication and complexity of a firm’s knowledge of its customers and competitors . It cap - tures the level of sophistication with which the firm is able to connect the unique and interdependent relationships among the factors that describe key issues about customers and competitors . Knowledge of the interdependencies of elements such as customers’ needs , behaviors , and prefer - ences and competitors’ products and strategies indicates that a firm has a deep understanding of its market . Thus , whereas breadth captures the horizontal dimension of knowledge , depth captures the vertical dimension . There are two reasons market knowledge depth should affect KIMs . First , deep market knowledge implies high and complex interdependencies among the knowledge elements ( McEvily and Chakravarthy 2002 ) . The transfer of such knowledge is error prone and involves a greater risk of mis - interpretation and misapplication in product innovation ( Galunic and Rodan 1998 ) . This is because deep functional knowledge limits the firm’s ability to draw new conclusions and find new links among diverse pieces of knowledge . Second , deep market knowledge implies differential func - tional expertise in collecting and disseminating market information . This leads to different “thought worlds” ( Leonard - Barton 1992 ) , which further increase the uncer - tainty and ambiguity of knowledge transfer ( Szulanski 1996 ) . For these reasons , deep knowledge tends to lead to rigidities in knowledge transfer and sharing , hindering the firm’s ability to assimilate knowledge . Consequently , firms develop coordinating structures to provide functional units with the means to understand and develop confidence in one anothers’ analysis and interpretation ( Hoopes and Postrel 1999 ) . Thus : H 2 : The deeper the market knowledge , the greater is the use of KIMs . “Market knowledge tacitness” is the extent to which market knowledge is not explicit but rather is difficult to codify and communicate ( e . g . , Nonaka 1994 ) . Market knowledge is tacit when people and functional units find it difficult to articulate explicitly what they know about cus - tomers and competitors and are unable to explain effec - tively the causal relationships between their actions and the associated outcomes . Tacitness slows the internal transfer of market knowledge because tacit knowledge cannot be fully codified and articulated even by an expert . It can be trans - ferred from one person to another only through a long process of apprenticeship , which necessarily involves face - to - face interactions , review of successful and unsuccessful projects , and frequent advice from experts ( Galunic and Rodan 1998 ; Szulanski 1996 ) . As an embedded knowledge , tacit knowledge requires the development of KIMs to unearth its potential value ( Madhavan and Grover 1998 ) . Birkinshaw , Nobel , and Ridderstråle ( 2002 ) find that the degree of observability ( i . e . , explicitness ) of technology knowledge is negatively related to knowledge integration structures . Thus : H 3 : The more tacit the market knowledge , the greater is the use of KIMs . “Market knowledge specificity” refers to the extent to which the firm’s knowledge is tailored to the requirements of specific contexts in which it is maximally effective but loses its value in other contexts ( Galunic and Rodan 1998 ) . For example , a firm’s knowledge can be related to the atti - tudes of a specific customer segment toward a specific product or strategy . Specific competitor knowledge may result from an in - depth analysis of the behavior , products , and strategies of a particular competitor . In both cases , the knowledge acquired is valuable only in the context of the focal firm . For example , Lenovo’s knowledge of the com - puter market was so specific to the Chinese context that it needed to acquire IBM’s personal computer division to increase its ability to compete on the global level . Specific market knowledge is likely to be acquired and used by experienced people and experts in specific market domains . Thus , it could be argued that the transfer of such knowledge is unproblematic even in the absence of KIMs . However , we have three reasons to predict a positive effect of specific market knowledge on KIMs . First , because spe - cific market knowledge is valuable in the context in which it has been generated , its value is highly time sensitive . Subra - mani and Venkatraman ( 2003 ) show that because specific market knowledge must be exploited in a timely manner , it engenders strong norms of joint decision making , a key aspect of KIMs . Second , specific market knowledge dimin - ishes knowledge recombination , impairing timely and effective contextual use ( Galunic and Rodan 1998 , p . 1197 ) . Third , specific market knowledge reflects the use of idio - syncratic routines in the collection and use of market infor - mation by different functions . As Galunic and Rodan ( 1998 ) argue , by producing specific knowledge , these rou - tines make the transfer of knowledge to other functions dif - ficult . These properties of specific market knowledge increase the implementation of KIMs to ensure early settle - ment of communication difficulties and enable timely flow and recombination of knowledge from different functional units in the product innovation process . H 4 : The more specific the market knowledge , the greater is the use of KIMs . Effect of Cross - Functional Collaboration on KIMs Cross - functional collaboration refers to the degree of coop - eration , the extent of representation , and the contribution of marketing , R & D , and other functional units to the product innovation process ( Kahn 1996 ; Li and Calantone 1998 ; Ruekert and Walker 1987 ; Song , Montoya - Weiss , and Schmidt 1997 ) . Cross - functional collaboration is intangible , volitional , and unstructured in that it reflects only the recog - Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross - Functional Collaboration / 99 nition by functional units of their strategic interdependence and their need to cooperate for the benefit of the organiza - tion ( Galunic and Rodan 1998 , p . 1198 ; Kahn 1996 ; Kahn and Mentzer 1998 ; Olson et al . 2001 ) . It ensures the align - ment of goals among functional units . In contrast , KIMs permit regular patterns of interactions that enable the trans - fer , recombination , and use of knowledge from different functions . Therefore , KIMs respond to the problem of coor - dinating different knowledge elements to execute complex organizational tasks . Anecdotal evidence supports the distinction between cross - functional collaboration and KIMs . First , despite the high degree of cooperation among its functional units , Toy - ota established coordinating mechanisms , including stan - dardized reporting and documentation , formalized work processes ( e . g . , project reviews ) , problem - solving meetings , and integrative leaders , to ensure knowledge sharing and integration among its different units ( Sobek , Liker , and Ward 1998 ) . Second , a study of the most innovative firms in the world indicates that two such firms , Southwest and BMW , have adopted mechanisms , such as colocation , face - to - face meetings , and standard documentation , to integrate the knowledge among members of their cross - functional teams , despite their high degree of cooperation proclivity ( BusinessWeek 2006 ) . The distinction of the two constructs is salient because coordinating knowledge—particularly , specialized and complex knowledge—among different units is problematic for firms , even when perfect goal congruence ( or full collaboration ) is established among them ( Grant 1996b , p . 114 ) . Contingency theory offers two principal reasons that cross - functional collaboration predicts KIMs . First , cross - functional collaboration implies increased resource depen - dency among functional units and , thus , a greater need for enhanced information - processing capability to coordinate the acquired knowledge . As the need for sharing knowledge and other resources among functional units increases , their interdependence grows along with the volume of resource flows and increases the use of coordinating mechanisms ( see Olson , Walker , and Ruekert 1995 , p . 53 ) . Thus , increased collaboration represents a critical strategic contin - gency for the design of coordination mechanisms ( Galbraith 1973 ; Kumar and Seth 1998 , p . 581 ) . As Kahn and Mentzer ( 1998 ) suggest , collaboration reflects the willingness of dif - ferent functional units to cooperate ; yet firms need to pro - vide structural mechanisms to put such willingness into action . Indeed , Birkinshaw , Nobel , and Ridderstråle ( 2002 ) find that functional interdependence influences the design of interunit KIMs in the firm . Second , the transfer and flow of knowledge among interdependent units is often costly , ambiguous , and uncer - tain because of the diversity of functional information , backgrounds , experiences , and thought worlds . This com - plicates analysis and interpretation and hinders the likeli - hood of novel recombinations of the firm’s knowledge ( Galunic and Rodan 1998 ) . For this reason , Madhavan and Grover ( 1998 ) argue that the collective knowledge of func - tional units constitutes only potential knowledge . As a result , Ruekert and Walker ( 1987 , p . 6 ) argue that to obtain value from cross - functional interactions , “mechanisms 2 The direction of causality can be questioned here . However , in addition to structural contingency theory , several other arguments support our interpretation . First , rational managers would invest in costly KIM processes only when they are satisfied that different functions are willing and able to collaborate . Second , rational managers know that structures such as KIMs may be ineffective in imposing collaboration , which is more of a human and social con - dition . Indeed , prior research suggests that an attempt to impose cross - functional collaboration through an early implementation of KIMs can yield the opposite result ( Kahn 1996 ) . Xie , Song , and Stringfellow ( 2003 , p . 233 ) also note that merely imposing a cross - functional structure for product innovation cannot ensure that different functional units will collaborate . [ must ] evolve to help reduce the uncertainty and ambiguity of resource , work , and assistance flows . ” Similarly , Garud and Nayyar ( 1994 , p . 372 ) point out that firms develop inte - gration mechanisms because of the uncertainty and ambigu - ity in translating embedded collective knowledge into knowledge embodied in the new product ( see also Griffin and Hauser 1996 , p . 209 ) . In brief , we argue that increased functional collaboration leads to the greater use of KIMs to regulate communication flow and learning in new product projects . 2 H 5 : The greater the cross - functional collaboration , the greater is the use of KIMs . Market Knowledge , Cross - Functional Collaboration , and Product Innovation Performance Market knowledge . Extant research considers market knowledge the fundamental driver of product innovation performance ( Atuahene - Gima 1995 , 2005 ; Li and Calan - tone 1998 ; Moorman and Miner 1997 ) . However , few stud - ies have provided detailed insights into the effects of differ - ent market knowledge characteristics on product innovation performance . Market knowledge breadth engenders product innovation performance because it increases the firm’s abil - ity to make connections among disparate market informa - tion , ideas , and concepts to gain broader and insightful per - spectives ( Reed and DeFillippi 1990 ) . This logic underpins the general idea about the positive role of market orienta - tion in product innovation ( Atuahene - Gima 1995 , 2005 ; Li and Calantone 1998 ) . A firm with broad market knowledge has heterogeneous information and understanding of cus - tomers and competitors , enabling it to design products that match the diverse needs of its customer segments . By enhancing the firm’s purview of the market , broad market knowledge also increases the firm’s ability to implement and execute complex tasks quickly in product innovation processes ( Kogut and Zander 1992 ) . It does this by enhanc - ing the chances of what Prabhu , Chandy , and Ellis ( 2005 ) call “happy accidents , ” in which concepts from different knowledge domains are applied in unexpected ways . A new product based on deep market knowledge limits a competitor’s ability to observe and understand the whole set of distinct and interdependent knowledge elements that underlies it ( Reed and DeFillippi 1990 ) . This is because market knowledge depth reflects a complex understanding of the causal interdependencies among customer problems and requirements and potential competitor strengths and 100 / Journal of Marketing , January 2007 responses , thus increasing the likelihood of the emergence of new ideas that are highly unique to the firm ( Galunic and Rodan 1998 ) . As McEvily and Chakravarthy ( 2002 ) find , competitor efforts to reconstruct such a product are likely to be undermined or lead to partial and erroneous results . Prabhu , Chandy , and Ellis ( 2005 , p . 116 ) also contend that knowledge depth results in superior products because it allows for the cross - fertilization of knowledge elements that increases flexibility in generating complex patterns of new knowledge . Tacit market knowledge leads to better new product per - formance because it allows for differences in cross - functional logics ( Galunic and Rodan 1998 ) . Prahalad and Bettis ( 1986 ) suggest that such differential logics ensure thoughtful deliberations and generate new perspectives , novel strategic alternatives , analyses , and interpretations that enhance the efficiency of the firm’s innovation activi - ties . Furthermore , tacit knowledge develops in a “commu - nity of interaction” ( Nonaka 1994 ) and thus is highly embedded in the firm’s social system . Competitors find it difficult to imitate the social context within which the focal firm develops its new products ( Reed and DeFillippi 1990 ) . Finally , specific market knowledge enhances innovation performance because it ensures a long - term relationship with specific contexts ( e . g . , customer segment ) that gener - ates highly idiosyncratic insights for product innovation . This protects the new products the firm develops from imi - tation because competitors lack the contextual customer knowledge that went into the process . Furthermore , a new product based on specific market knowledge is more likely to be differentiated to suit the specific customer and com - petitor conditions ( McEvily and Chakravarthy 2002 ) . Cross - functional collaboration . The positive effect of cross - functional collaboration on product innovation perfor - mance is well documented in the literature ( see Griffin and Hauser 1996 ; Luo , Slotegraaf , and Pan 2006 ; Song and Parry 1997 ) . The logic is that cross - functional collaboration ensures that marketing , technical , and other functional capabilities are combined to develop a product that satisfies customer needs . It accomplishes this by improving the effi - ciency of knowledge use and allowing for quality decision making in new product project teams ( Madhavan and Grover 1998 ) . H 6 : The greater the market knowledge ( a ) breadth , ( b ) depth , ( c ) tacitness , and ( d ) specificity , the better is the product innovation performance . H 7 : The greater the cross - functional collaboration , the better is the product innovation performance . Mediating Effect of KIMs on Product Innovation Performance The direct - effects arguments for the impacts of market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration on product innovation performance are persuasive . However , a careful inspection indicates that the arguments implicitly assume a role for KIMs . As we argued previously , both the KBV and contingency theory suggest that the stickiness of market knowledge and the increased information - processing demands that result from cross - functional collaboration constitute factors that determine the firm’s integration mechanisms ( Birkinshaw , Nobel , and Ridderstråle 2002 ; Galbraith 1973 ; Germain and Droge 1997 ; Kumar and Seth 1998 ; Thompson 1967 ) . Indeed , the KBV suggests that it is not knowledge per se but rather its integration that ensures competitive advantage ( Grant 1991 , 1996a ) . Specifically , KIMs ensure better performance because they enhance the likelihood of finding solutions in the product innovation process by infusing the functional units with collective learning capability . Implicit in this argument is the notion that KIMs connect knowledge to performance . Because KIMs are mandated processes for learning , they provide milestones that ensure a sense of order in cross - functional knowledge sharing , use , and learning . By providing a for - mal structure for knowledge integration , KIMs also provide a common forum for periodic feedback , which ensures quality decision making and completeness of a project team’s activities . In so doing , KIMs reduce wasteful explo - rations and errors in product innovation ( Sheremata 2000 ) . Thus , dimensions of market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration affect product innovation perfor - mance indirectly through their effects on KIMs . This dis - cussion suggests the following hypotheses : H 8 : The greater the KIMs , the better is the product innova - tion performance . H 9 : KIMs mediate the effects of market knowledge ( a ) breadth , ( b ) depth , ( c ) tacitness , and ( d ) specificity on product innovation performance . H 10 : KIMs mediate the effect of cross - functional collaboration on product innovation performance . Research Methods Sample and Data Collection China is an ideal context for this study . The extreme com - plexity and dynamism of this transitional environment means that firms must confront not only the challenges of new ( and often dysfunctional ) competition but also collaps - ing capabilities ( Li and Atuahene - Gima 2001 ) . For this rea - son , cross - functional collaboration and mechanisms for using market knowledge in product innovation are critical for firms to sustain innovation performance . The instrument was prepared in English and then translated into Chinese . It was checked for accuracy in line with the conventional back - translation process . We pretested the instrument with 25 managers who had at least three years of business experience in China to examine the face validity and to assess informants’ understanding of the survey questions . The study used a sample of 750 firms selected randomly from a mailing list of 2500 high - technology firms provided by a local consulting firm . As with previous studies in China ( Atuahene - Gima 2005 ; Li and Atuahene - Gima 2001 ) , we collected the data on - site . An interviewer scheduled appointments with the marketing manager / director as a first informant , who then nominated a second knowledgeable informant . The inter - viewer presented the key informants with the survey ques - tionnaire and collected the questionnaire on completion . We motivated respondents by assuring them of confidentiality Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross - Functional Collaboration / 101 3 Unlike other studies ( e . g . , Atuahene - Gima 2005 ; Li and Calan - tone 1998 ; Narver and Slater 1990 ) that differentiate between cus - tomer and competitor knowledge , we take a holistic measurement and by offering a summary of the research results and a free workshop on the research findings ⎯ information that would be meaningless to them in the absence of accurate data ( Li and Atuahene - Gima 2001 ) . We received 363 usable ques - tionnaires , for a response rate of 48 % . We compared a sam - ple of 50 participating firms with a sample of nonparticipat - ing firms for which we had data on sales , R & D expense , and number of employees . Analyses of variance indicated no significant differences between the two groups on num - ber of employees ( F = 1 . 01 ) , sales in the most recent year ( F = . 89 ) , and R & D expenditure as percentage of sales ( F = . 98 ) . Of the first informants , 90 % were from marketing and sales , 4 % were chief executive officers / general managers , and 6 % were product development managers . These infor - mants had a mean industry experience of 8 . 18 years and a mean firm experience of 4 . 77 years . Of the second infor - mants , 73 % were product development director / managers , 9 % were from marketing / sales , 11 % were chief executive officers / general managers , and 7 % were from R & D . These informants had a mean industry experience of 7 . 76 years and a mean firm experience of 4 . 55 years . We also exam - ined the quality of the informants by asking them to indi - cate on a ten - point scale their degree of knowledge of ( 1 = “not at all knowledgeable , ” and 10 = “extremely knowl - edgeable” ) and involvement in ( 1 = “no involvement , ” and 10 = “very high involvement” ) product development issues in the firm . The means for the first and second informants , respectively , were 7 . 55 and 7 . 40 for the first item and 8 . 00 and 7 . 78 for the second item . Using a multigroup analysis , we obtained the following results : unconstrained confirma - tory factor analysis ( CFA ) model for the marketing and nonmarketing groups : χ 2 = 2225 . 7 , d . f . = 1440 ; constrained model for marketing and nonmarketing groups with equal - ity constraints for structural paths , variances , and covari - ances : χ 2 = 2307 . 6 , d . f . = 1540 ; Δχ 2 = 81 . 9 , Δ d . f . = 100 ; p > . 10 . Given these results of tests of invariance , we pooled the data for analysis . Measures of Constructs Market knowledge dimensions . We measured market knowledge breadth with four items that asked respondents , for example , to evaluate their firms’ market knowledge on a continuum from “limited” to “wide ranging” ( Zahra , Ire - land , and Hitt 2000 ) . We measured market knowledge depth with four items that asked the respondents , for example , to evaluate their firms’ customer knowledge on a continuum from “basic” to “advanced” ( Zahra , Ireland , and Hitt 2000 ) . We measured market knowledge tacitness with four items that addressed the degree to which a firm’s market knowl - edge could be formally documented , communicated , and learned without personal experience ( Szulanski 1996 ) . On the basis of Reed and DeFillippi’s ( 1990 ) work , we mea - sured market knowledge specificity with three items that reflected the extent to which market knowledge is specific to the firm’s environment . 3 approach to the concept of market knowledge . Because the charac - teristics of knowledge we describe here are the same for customer and competitor knowledge , we did not have any theoretical ratio - nale to expect differential effects of customer and competitor knowledge on KIMs . Thus , to reduce the complexity of the model and the burden on our informants , we chose a more aggregated measure of market knowledge . 4 We took steps to ensure that respondents did not confuse this measure of the achievement of the firm’s product innovation objectives with its overall performance . We measured overall firm performance relative to competitors with eight items : return of sales , growth in profit , return on assets , sales growth , market share growth , cash flow , overall operational efficiency , and reputation for performance . We performed three discriminant tests for prod - uct innovation performance and firm performance . First , a CFA two - factor solution yielded the following : χ 2 = 351 . 20 , d . f . = 64 . When we constrained them into one factor , we obtained the fol - lowing : χ 2 = 773 . 30 , d . f . = 65 . Therefore , we have a significant change in chi - square of 422 . 10 ( d . f . = 1 , p < . 000 ) , suggesting dis - criminant validity . Second , we performed discriminant tests using Fornell and Larcker’s ( 1981 ) approach . The average variance extracted for both product innovation performance ( . 72 ) and firm performance ( . 71 ) was greater than the squared correlation between them ( . 66 ) . Finally , the correlation between product inno - vation performance and firm performance was . 81 , with a standard error of . 02 . The two - standard - error confidence interval for this correlation estimate is between . 77 and . 85 . Because it does not include 1 , discriminant validity is demonstrated ( Anderson and Gerbing 1988 ) . Cross - functional collaboration . On the basis of prior studies ( e . g . , Li and Calantone 1998 ) , we measured cross - functional collaboration with three items that reflected the extent of cooperation among functions . For example , we asked the respondents to rate the extent to which different functional units cooperate in establishing goals and priori - ties for the firms’ product innovation . KIMs . Two previous studies ( Zahra , Ireland , and Hitt 2000 ; Zahra and Nielsen 2002 ) informed the measure of KIMs . We used five items that addressed the extent to which a firm uses a set of formal processes ( e . g . , information - sharing meetings , formal analysis of projects ) to capture , interpret , and integrate knowledge . Product innovation performance . On the basis of Atuahene - Gima , Slater , and Olson’s ( 2005 ) research , we measured product innovation performance with five items that asked respondents to indicate the extent to which the firm has achieved its product development objectives , such as market share and profitability . 4 Control variables . In testing our hypotheses , we con - trolled for firm size and slack , which reflect the firm’s resources and market power to exploit existing competen - cies , build new ones , and develop innovations ( Chandy and Tellis 1998 ) . To prevent skewness , we measured firm size with the logarithm of the number of employees . We mea - sured slack with three items that tapped the availability of excess resources to fund new projects . We controlled for environmental uncertainty because the KBV suggests that knowledge integration becomes even more critical in uncer - tain and competitive environments ( Grant 1996a ) . Further - more , functional units tend to perceive higher inter - dependence and therefore are motivated to implement integration mechanisms in uncertain environments ( Ruekert 102 / Journal of Marketing , January 2007 5 The exceptions were the AVEs for KIMs and market knowl - edge breadth for the second informant group , which were slightly below the highest squared correlation with the other latent variables , indicating weak discriminant validity . For these two constructs , we performed an additional test based on the work of Bagozzi , Yi , and Phillips ( 1991 ) . In all cases , the two - factor model fit the data better than the constrained one - factor model . Detailed results of these analyses are available on request . and Walker 1987 ) . We examine two aspects of uncertainty . First , market uncertainty reflects the speed of change in customer needs and preferences and in competitor actions ; we measured this with three items that cover the speed of change of customer needs and competitive conditions . Sec - ond , technological uncertainty reflects the speed of change and instability of the technology environment ; we measured this with four items that tap the speed and unpredictability of technological changes . Finally , we controlled for the degree of radicalness of the firm’s product innovation activities to capture the firm’s learning capability , which influences propensity for knowl - edge sharing and product innovation outcomes ( see McGrath 2001 ) . We measured product innovation radical - ness with three items that assessed the newness of the firm’s innovation activities in terms of , for example , customers targeted and products offered . The Appendix presents all the measures and their sources . Assessing the Reliability and Validity of Measures We performed an exploratory factor analysis with Varimax rotation for data we obtained from both types of informants . Both the first and the second informants’ responses resulted in 11 factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 , accounting for 68 . 58 % and 68 . 50 % of the total variance , respectively . For both informants , all the items loaded cleanly on the expected factors , without significant cross - loadings . Then , we tested the measurement model for both informants with a CFA , using AMOS 6 . 0 . All the items loaded significantly on the expected constructs , indicating convergent and dis - criminant validity of the measures . The fit indexes showed that the model fit the data reasonably well for both the first ( χ 2 / d . f . = 1 . 56 , goodness - of - fit index [ GFI ] = . 87 , compara - tive fit index [ CFI ] = . 94 , and root mean square error of approximation [ RMSEA ] = . 04 ) and the second ( χ 2 / d . f . = 1 . 43 , GFI = . 88 , CFI = . 95 , and RMSEA = . 03 ) informant . In each case the constructs had acceptable levels of reliabil - ity , average variance extracted ( AVE ) , and discriminant validity . 5 Next , we submitted data from the two informant groups to two multigroup analyses to assess the invariance of the measurement model . First , we specified a model in which we constrained factor loadings , variances , and covariances in the two groups to be equal and compared it with a base - line model with no equality constraints , using a chi - square difference test ( Byrne 2001 ) . The results suggested the absence of significant differences in factors loadings , vari - ances , and covariances ( unconstrained model : χ 2 = 2153 . 11 , d . f . = 1440 ; constrained model : χ 2 = 2218 . 32 , d . f . = 1540 ; Δχ 2 = 65 . 21 , Δ d . f . = 100 ; p > . 10 ) . Second , we assessed the 6 For the seven - point scale adopted for product innovation performance , – 1 . 25 ≤ r wg ≤ 1 . 7 The results were as follows : market knowledge breadth versus market knowledge depth ( unconstrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 138 . 26 [ 19 ] ; constrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 279 . 28 [ 20 ] ; Δχ 2 [ Δ d . f . ] = 141 . 02 [ 1 ] ) , market knowledge breadth versus market knowledge specificity ( unconstrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 79 . 08 [ 13 ] ; con - strained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 461 . 05 [ 14 ] ; Δχ 2 [ Δ d . f . ] = 381 . 97 [ 1 ] ) , market knowledge breadth versus market knowledge tacitness ( unconstrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 89 . 83 [ 19 ] ; constrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 544 . 78 [ 20 ] ; Δχ 2 [ Δ d . f . ] = 454 . 95 [ 1 ] ) , market knowl - edge breadth versus cross - functional collaboration ( unconstrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 96 . 33 [ 13 ] ; constrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 250 . 23 [ 14 ] ; Δχ 2 [ Δ d . f . ] = 153 . 90 [ 1 ] ) , market knowledge breadth versus KIMs ( unconstrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 238 . 20 [ 26 ] ; con - strained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 488 . 29 [ 27 ] ; Δχ 2 [ Δ d . f . ] = 250 . 09 [ 1 ] ) , market knowledge breadth versus technology uncertainty ( uncon - strained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 95 . 89 [ 19 ] ; constrained model : χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 525 . 09 [ 20 ] ; Δχ 2 [ Δ d . f . ] = 429 . 20 [ 1 ] ) , market knowledge invariance of items and latent variables means between the two groups . Following Steenkamp and Baumgartner’s ( 1998 ) guidelines , we first compared the raw score means for each single item with a one - way analysis of variance and found no statistically significant differences between the two informant groups ( . 22 < F < . 99 ) . Then , we esti - mated two CFA models in which the latent variable means were first freely estimated and then constrained to equality ( Sörbom 1974 ) . The results suggested the absence of sig - nificant differences in latent variable means between the two groups of respondents ( unconstrained model : χ 2 = 2602 . 04 , d . f . = 1478 ; constrained model : χ 2 = 2607 . 84 , d . f . = 1489 ; Δχ 2 = 5 . 80 , Δ d . f . = 11 ; p > . 10 ) . This indicates that the pattern of factor loadings and the latent variables’ means , variances , and covariances do not differ signifi - cantly across the two groups . As further evidence of consis - tency between the two informant groups , we computed the interrater agreement index ( r wg ) for each measure ( James , Demaree , and Wolf 1984 ) . For constructs measured on the five - point scale , the index ranges from – 1 to 1 , indicating minimum and maximum agreement respectively . 6 The low - est r wg index for the whole set of items was . 83 , indicating a high level of agreement between the two informant groups ( see the Appendix ) . Given these results , we ran a third CFA on the com - bined items for the two informant groups . This model per - formed reasonably well ( χ 2 / d . f . = 1163 . 2 / 720 = 1 . 62 , GFI = . 86 , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ; see the Appendix ) . On the basis of Fornell and Larcker’s ( 1981 ) work , we tested for discriminant validity of the constructs by examining whether the square root of the AVE of each construct ( shown in the diagonal in Table 1 ) was greater than the highest correlation between latent variables involving the focal construct ( shown above the diagonal in Table 1 ) . Mar - ket knowledge breadth had slightly weak discriminant validity . As a fallback , we followed Bagozzi , Yi , and Phillips’s ( 1991 ) recommendation and examined whether a one - factor model fit the data better than the hypothesized two - factor model for each pair of constructs involving mar - ket knowledge breadth . In each case , the chi - square of the constrained one - factor model was significantly greater than the chi - square for the unconstrained two - factor model , sug - gesting discriminant validity . 7 Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross - Functional Collaboration / 103 TABLE 1 Correlation Matrix and Descriptive Statistics of Measures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 .

Given these results , we used the average of the responses of the two informants for all the remaining analy - ses to reduce the potential for common method variance ( Slater and Atuahene - Gima 2004 ) . Table 1 reports descrip - tive statistics and correlations among the study variables . Note that we measured product innovation performance on a seven - point scale . This provides a different psychological frame to the informants compared with the other variables measured on five - point scales , thus hindering common method bias . Analysis and Results Direct Effects We used regression analysis to test the direct effects of mar - ket knowledge characteristics and cross - functional collabo - ration on KIMs and product innovation performance . As Table 2 ( Model 1 ) shows , market knowledge breadth ( b = . 16 , p < . 01 ) , market knowledge depth ( b = . 20 , p < . 01 ) , market knowledge specificity ( b = . 13 , p < . 01 ) , and cross - functional collaboration ( b = . 31 , p < . 01 ) have a positive and significant effect on KIMs . These results support H 1 , H 2 , H 4 , and H 5 . The effect of market knowledge tacitness on KIMs is not significant ; thus , H 3 is not supported . The results in Model 2 show that market knowledge breadth ( b = . 26 , p < . 01 ) , market knowledge depth ( b = . 18 , p < . 01 ) , and market knowledge specificity ( b = . 09 , p < . 05 ) have positive and significant effects on product innova - tion performance , whereas the effect of market knowledge tacitness is not significant . These results support H 6a , b , d but not H 6c . Cross - functional collaboration is unrelated to prod - uct innovation performance ; thus , H 7 is not supported . Among the control variables , organizational slack ( b = . 16 , p < . 01 ) and technology uncertainty ( b = . 16 , p < . 01 ) are positively related to KIMs , but only firm size is related to product innovation performance ( b = . 21 , p < . 01 ) . Mediating Effect of KIMs We followed the three - step regression procedure that Baron and Kenny ( 1986 ) recommend to examine the mediating role of KIMs . As we showed previously , market knowledge breadth , depth , and specificity have positive and significant effects on product innovation performance . Furthermore , all dimensions of market knowledge , except for tacitness , and cross - functional collaboration are positively related to KIMs . When KIMs are entered into Model 3 ( Table 2 ) , it shows a positive and significant effect on product innova - tion performance ( b = . 14 , p < . 05 ) , in support of H 8 . The inclusion of KIMs leads to a slight decrease in the effect size of market knowledge breadth ( from . 26 to . 24 ) and of market knowledge depth ( from . 18 to . 15 ) , but both remain significant , suggesting partial mediation . The effect of mar - ket knowledge specificity on product innovation perfor - mance was not significant , suggesting full mediation . Recall that market knowledge tacitness and cross - functional collaboration are unrelated to product innovation performance . Testing for mediation for these variables vio - lates Baron and Kenny’s ( 1986 ) first test condition . How - ever , several recent studies in various fields of research have argued that this constraint may be relaxed without hamper - 104 / Journal of Marketing , January 2007 TABLE 2 Results of Regression Analysis : Standardized Path Coefficients ( t - Values ) KIMs Product Innovation Performance Independent Variables Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Control Variables Organizational slack . 16 . 10 . 08 ( 3 . 38 ) * * ( 1 . 94 ) ( 1 . 53 ) Radical innovation – . 02 – . 05 – . 04 ( – . 41 ) ( – . 87 ) ( – . 83 ) Firm size . 04 . 21 . 21 ( 1 . 05 ) ( 4 . 52 ) * * ( 4 . 42 ) * * Technology uncertainty . 16 . 08 . 06 ( 3 . 52 ) * * ( 1 . 43 ) ( 1 . 00 ) Market uncertainty – . 07 . 03 . 04 ( – 1 . 45 ) ( . 49 ) ( . 66 ) Main Effects Market knowledge breadth . 16 . 26 . 24 ( 3 . 13 ) * * ( 4 . 40 ) * * ( 3 . 99 ) * * Market knowledge depth . 20 . 18 . 15 ( 3 . 88 ) * * ( 3 . 08 ) * * ( 2 . 58 ) * * Market knowledge tacitness . 01 – . 01 – . 01 ( . 13 ) ( – . 26 ) ( – . 27 ) Market knowledge specificity . 13 . 09 . 07 ( 3 . 00 ) * * ( 1 . 79 ) * ( 1 . 43 ) Cross - functional collaboration . 31 . 04 – . 01 ( 6 . 73 ) * * ( . 73 ) ( – . 07 ) Mediating Effect KIMs . 14 ( 2 . 19 ) * F value 30 . 82 * * 14 . 78 * * 14 . 02 * * R 2 . 48 . 30 . 31 Adjusted R 2 . 46 . 28 . 29 Δ R 2 . 01 F change 4 . 80 * * p < . 05 ( one - tailed test for hypotheses , and two - tailed test for control variables ) . * * p < . 01 ( one - tailed test for hypotheses , and two - tailed test for control variables ) . Notes : N = 351 . 8 For example , Shrout and Bolger ( 2002 , p . 429 ) support recom - mendations to set aside the first step of Baron and Kenny’s ( 1986 ) approach , arguing that “ [ b ] ecause a test of the X → Y association may be more powerful when mediation is taken into account , it seems unwise to defer considering mediation until the bivariate association between X and Y is established . ” Similarly , Preacher and Hayes ( 2004 , p . 719 ) note several errors that could occur by strict adherence to this condition and argue that it is possible to find a significant , indirect effect even when there is no evidence for a significant , direct effect . ing the validity of the mediation analysis ( see Preacher and Hayes 2004 , p . 719 ; Shrout and Bolger 2002 , pp . 429 – 30 ; Smith , Collins , and Clark 2005 , pp . 354 – 55 ) . 8 Specifically , Sobel’s ( 1982 ) test enables the investigation of indirect effects for independent variables , regardless of the signifi - cance of their total effects on the dependent variable . With the exception of market knowledge tacitness , Sobel’s test indicated significant , indirect effects for market knowledge breadth ( b = . 04 , t = 1 . 71 , p < . 05 ) , market knowledge depth ( b = . 05 , t = 1 . 86 , p < . 05 ) , market knowledge specificity ( b = . 02 , t = 1 . 71 , p < . 05 ) , and cross - functional collabora - tion ( b = . 08 , t = 2 . 06 , p < . 05 ) , in support of H 9a , b , d and H 10 but not of H 9c . Structural Equation Modeling We examined the robustness of the preceding results with structural equation modeling ( SEM ) . The first model ( SEM1 ) examined the direct effects of the independent variables on product innovation performance with the path from KIMs constrained to zero . The fit indexes ( χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 1206 . 80 [ 751 ] , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ) suggested a good fit with the data . The second model ( SEM2 ) , which involved a full mediation of the effects of the independent variables by KIMs , also showed a good fit with the data ( χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 1228 . 10 [ 755 ] , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ) . Finally , based on modification indexes , a third partial medi - ation model ( SEM 3 ) , which allowed a direct effect of mar - ket knowledge breadth on product innovation performance , showed a good fit ( χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 1203 . 50 [ 754 ] , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ) . Model comparisons with the chi - square difference test indicated that SEM3 performed better than both SEM1 ( Δχ 2 [ Δ d . f . ] = – 3 . 3 [ 3 ] , p > . 10 ) and SEM2 ( Δχ 2 [ Δ d . f . ] = – 24 . 6 [ 1 ] , p < . 001 ) . Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross - Functional Collaboration / 105 9 Differences between estimated coefficients in regression analy - sis and SEM can be due to different estimation approaches ( ordi - nary least squares versus maximum likelihood ) or because regres - sion analysis does not account for measurement error . 10 For indirect effects ( both with Sobel’s test and SEM ) , we report unstandardized coefficients and one - tailed significance lev - els . For SEM , we obtained total , direct , and indirect effects esti - mates and significance using the AMOS 6 . 0 bootstrap estimation procedure with 1000 resamples . With the exception of a nonsignificant effect of market knowledge depth , the structural paths in SEM3 were consis - tent with the results we obtained using the regression analy - sis , and KIMs ( b = . 18 , t = 1 . 70 , p < . 05 ) and market knowl - edge breadth ( b = . 39 , t = 3 . 50 , p < . 01 ) were significantly related to product innovation performance . 9 Following Brown’s ( 1997 ) , Shrout and Bolger’s ( 2002 ) , and others’ ( see n . 8 ) recommendations , we again tested the signifi - cance of the specific mediation effects as follows : market knowledge breadth ( total effect b = . 85 , p < . 05 ; direct effect = . 83 , p < . 05 ; indirect effect b = . 03 , not significant [ n . s . ] ) , market knowledge depth ( total effect b = . 16 , n . s . ; direct effect = . 09 , n . s . ; indirect effect b = . 07 , p < . 10 ) , mar - ket knowledge specificity ( total effect b = . 14 , n . s . ; direct effect = . 10 , n . s . ; indirect effect b = . 04 , p < . 10 ) , and cross - functional collaboration ( total effect b = – . 05 , n . s . ; direct effect = – . 17 , n . s . ; indirect effect b = . 12 , p < . 10 ) . 10 Overall , the results of this study suggest four conclu - sions : First , market knowledge specificity and cross - functional collaboration influence product innovation per - formance through KIMs . Second , market knowledge depth has both a direct and an indirect effect ( through KIMs ) on product innovation performance . Third , market knowledge breadth has a direct , nonmediated effect on product innova - tion performance . Fourth , product innovation performance is not influenced either directly or indirectly by market knowledge tacitness . Discussion Our goal in this article was to advance the marketing litera - ture by untangling the complex relationships among market knowledge dimensions , cross - functional collaboration , KIMs , and product innovation performance . We found that market knowledge depth and specificity affect product innovation performance through KIMs . Note that though the direct effect size of KIMs on product innovation perfor - mance is small relative to the effect of market knowledge breadth , it plays the additional role of linking not only mar - ket knowledge depth and specificity but also cross - functional collaboration to product innovation performance . These results echo the view that being a sticky asset , knowl - edge is a contingency variable and that the design for KIMs needs to take into account the nature of the knowledge base of the firm ( e . g . , Birkinshaw , Nobel , and Ridderstråle 2002 ; Germain and Droge 1997 ) . We found no support for the direct , positive effect of cross - functional collaboration on product innovation perfor - mance . Instead , we found that cross - functional collabora - tion positively affects product innovation performance through KIMs . This is consistent with the structural contin - gency theory argument that increased information - processing demands that result from the interdependence of functional units determine the degree to which KIMs are adopted . Although cross - functional collaboration and KIMs are important factors in the product innovation process , as is widely reported in the marketing literature , we offer the new insight that the latter factor is the route that makes the former a more valuable resource in product innovation . In summary , our findings imply that market knowledge specificity and cross - functional collaboration ( and , in part , market knowledge depth ) are only potential resources and may not be inherently valuable for product innovation per - formance . Being distal antecedents , their potential for enhancing product innovation performance may be realized , totally or in part , through KIMs . However , the situation appears to be more complex because the effect of market knowledge breadth on product innovation performance is direct , not through KIMs . Therefore , market knowledge breadth appears to be the most potent driver of product innovation performance among the different dimensions of market knowledge we examined herein . This finding implies that types of market knowledge may have different intrinsic properties , a nuanced insight that has not yet been recognized in extant contingency theory and in the KBV . The nonsignificant effect of market knowledge tacitness on KIMs was a surprise because prior research has found that it increases the difficulty of knowledge transfer . The lack of a relationship between market knowledge tacitness and product innovation performance echoes the mixed per - spectives pertaining to the effect of tacitness in extant research ( see Galunic and Rodan 1998 ; Hedlund 1994 ; McEvily and Chakravarthy 2002 ) . We conducted a series of post hoc moderating tests with other variables in this study but found no significant nonlinear or moderated effects of market knowledge tacitness on product innovation perfor - mance . A possible explanation for our finding may be gleaned from the work of Nonaka ( 1994 ) , who argues that tacit knowledge is created by individuals and is initially shared within homogeneous “communities of interaction , ” such as functional units . To overcome problems of different thought worlds among such units , firms may rely on project leaders with A - shaped capabilities to “craft a unifying vision that does justice to all the disciplines represented” ( Madhavan and Grover 1998 , p . 4 ) . As Griffin and Hauser ( 1996 , p . 209 , emphasis added ) note , “These successful developers may have internalized a process that allows them to get product to market successfully . ” This implies that unlike other market knowledge dimensions , integration of tacit market knowledge may be achieved through the tacit skills of effective team leaders rather than through formal KIMs . This appears to explain why firms such as Toyota employ the “integrative leader” as one of the key KIMs in product development ( Sobek , Liker , and Ward 1998 , p . 40 ) . As we mentioned previously , in other contexts , scholars have argued convincingly that KIMs are moderators . We evaluated this view and found significant interaction effects only between KIMs and cross - functional collaboration ( b = – . 11 , t = – 1 . 95 , p < . 05 ) and market knowledge depth ( b = 106 / Journal of Marketing , January 2007 11 To test interactions with SEM , we followed the procedure that Ping ( 1995 ) suggests to build the interaction terms . First , for each pair of constructs X and Z forming an interaction , we mean - centered all their indicators x 1 – x n and z 1 – z m . Second , for each pair of constructs X and Z , we computed a single indicator that repre - sents the latent product xz as ( x 1 + … x n ) ( z 1 + … z m ) . Third , we specified a model including the two focal constructs and their interaction term . The loading and error for the latent product are given by two equations : λ xz = ( λ x1 + … λ xn ) ( λ z1 + … λ zm ) , and θ ε xz = ( λ x1 + … λ xn ) 2 VAR ( X ) ( θ ε z1 + … θ ε zm ) + ( λ z1 + … λ zm ) 2 VAR ( Z ) ( θ ε x1 + … θ ε xn ) + ( θ ε x1 + … θ ε xn ) ( θ ε z1 + … θ ε zm ) , for which all the terms on the right - hand side are taken from the measurement model ( Ping 1995 ) . The fit indexes for the five mod - els containing the relevant interaction terms are as follows : KIMs × market knowledge breadth interaction ( χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 1306 . 49 [ 823 ] , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ) , KIMs × market knowledge depth interaction ( χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 1325 . 09 [ 823 ] , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ) , KIMs × market knowledge tacitness interaction ( χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 1298 . 10 [ 823 ] , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ) , KIMs × market knowledge specificity interaction ( χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 1327 . 92 [ 823 ] , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ) , and KIMs × cross - functional collaboration interaction ( χ 2 [ d . f . ] = 1284 . 85 [ 823 ] , CFI = . 94 , and RMSEA = . 04 ) . – . 16 , t = – 2 . 93 , p < . 01 ) . 11 These findings are contrary to expectations , but they are novel . They suggest that KIMs play not only a mediation role but also an unexpected nega - tive moderating role . Moorman and Miner ( 1997 , p . 101 ) find that environ - mental “turbulence can reduce the value of shared knowl - edge within organizations . ” Although they measure shared knowledge or organizational memory more broadly , the routine component of memory and our concept of KIMs may overlap to some extent . For this reason , we tested the interaction effects of technology / market turbulence and KIMs on product innovation performance but found no sig - nificant results . A possible reason might be that we focus more narrowly on structured mechanisms for knowledge integration , whereas the concept of organizational memory included collective beliefs , physical artifacts , and behav - ioral routines , which may interact more strongly with envi - ronmental turbulence . Theoretical Contributions This study contributes to marketing theory of product inno - vation in five main ways . First , the direct effect of market knowledge breadth sheds new light on the importance ascribed to the concept of market orientation in product innovation and the importance that marketing theory places on broad understanding of customers and competitors ( Atuahene - Gima 1995 , 2005 ; Jaworski and Kohli 1993 ; Narver and Slater 1990 ) . However , the indirect , positive effects of market knowledge depth and specificity also underscore the need for market orientation theory to embrace a more fine - grained notion of market knowledge . Without this , marketing theory is unlikely to unearth new insights into the role of market knowledge in product inno - vation , such as those we offer here . Second , the results regarding the effects of market knowledge dimensions suggest that theoretical exploration of the failure of firms in product innovation should not be ascribed mainly to their failure in cross - functional collabo - ration , as suggested in much of the previous research and in anecdotal reports . Rather , it may be possible for firms to fail even when they have effective and efficient cross - functional collaboration , if they do not have broad , deep , and specific market knowledge . This study indicates that examining only the direct effects of market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration separately may lead to an incorrect view of their power and , thus , to erroneous implications about their role in product innovation . Third , we clarify how and why KIMs matter in product innovation performance by showing simultaneously their mediating and moderating roles . We show that KIMs con - vert some market knowledge dimensions and cross - functional collaboration into product innovation perfor - mance . This new insight implies that by failing to consider the mediating role of KIMs , previous research may have assumed away the information - processing demands in product innovation and thus may have reached a premature , and perhaps overly optimistic , view of the importance of market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration in product innovation . More important , these findings suggest an important qualification of the dual tenets of KBV , namely , that knowledge is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for competitive advantage and that effective inte - gration of knowledge is the key driver of competitive advantage . We show that KIMs play an important role in product innovation performance , as predicted by the KBV , by partially mediating the effects of market knowledge depth and by completely mediating the effects of market knowledge specificity and cross - functional collaboration on product innovation performance . In other words , and con - sistent with the KBV’s contention , market knowledge depth and specificity as well as cross - functional collaboration may not be intrinsically valuable ; their value may be real - ized through KIMs . Fourth , contrary to the KBV tenet , market knowledge breath is valuable in and of itself because it has a direct , unmediated effect on product innovation performance . Thus , it is a sufficient condition for product innovation per - formance . These differential strengths of market knowledge characteristics suggest that the KBV understates the inher - ent value of some types of market knowledge . Thus , this study suggests the need for further research to focus on the explicit articulation of the types of market knowledge and the consideration of their different roles in understanding the firm’s effectiveness in product innovation . Without such an approach , a more nuanced understanding of the role of market knowledge may be missed . Fifth , given the complexity of the study context , the negative moderating effects of KIMs suggest that at high levels , they could stifle the effects of market knowledge Market Knowledge Dimensions and Cross - Functional Collaboration / 107 depth and cross - functional collaboration on product innova - tion performance . It appears that though some characteris - tics of market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration may make KIMs necessary , the degree of KIMs must be tempered by the amount of contextual complexity the firm faces and the resulting need for functional flexibility and , perhaps , autonomy ( Eisenhardt and Martin 2000 ) . At high levels , KIMs may stifle the flexibility and creativity of cross - functional interactions and in the use of deep market knowledge ( Kumar and Seth 1998 , p . 583 ) . Although previ - ous studies in other contexts have found positive moderat - ing roles for KIMs , the new insight we offer is that there may be a threshold of the KIM level beyond which market knowledge depth and cross - functional collaboration may have detrimental effects on performance . Thus , the use of KIMs appears to involve a trade - off between their necessity occasioned by stickiness of market knowledge and the information - processing demands of cross - functional collab - oration on the one hand and the implementation costs of KIMs on the other hand . This is a trade - off that has not been uncovered in extant research . Managerial Implications The argument that market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration enhance product innovation performance has gained wide acceptance among practitioners . Our study supports this conclusion but also qualifies it in several ways for managers . First , our study calls on managers to consider the attributes of the market knowledge they use in new product projects to design KIMs properly . Marketing man - agers are fervent adherents of the market orientation tenet with respect to the value of acquiring broad and comprehen - sive knowledge about customers and competitors . This notion is justified given the research on the positive effects of market orientation on product innovation outcomes . However , this study digs deeper into the features of market knowledge by finding that though broad market knowledge is important , managers need to pay equal attention to deep and specific market knowledge . These dimensions of mar - ket knowledge appear to influence the design of KIMs , which in turn affect product innovation performance . Thus , the new insight for managers is that broad market knowl - edge is inherently valuable for product innovation perfor - mance , but emphasizing breadth over other market knowl - edge characteristics and integration mechanisms may be detrimental for the achievement of the full potential of the firm’s new product projects . Managers need to endow new project teams with the human and financial resources to acquire and apply broad , deep , and specific market knowl - edge in new product development activities . In this respect , our measures of market knowledge characteristics could serve as guides for managers who want to collect and use customer and competitor knowledge in line with these characteristics . Second , the results suggest that it is the structured knowledge integration processes that enable the translation of cross - functional collaboration into better product innova - tion performance . This means that managers who encourage cross - functional collaboration as an end in itself but neglect formal knowledge integration processes may not achieve their intended objectives in product innovation . Toyota pro - vides a good example of a company that values cross - functional collaboration but takes the extra step of deploy - ing KIMs ( Sobek , Liker , and Ward 1998 ) . Finally , managers must be creative in balancing the need for KIMs engen - dered by the information - processing demands of cross - functional collaboration and market knowledge and the need for functional flexibility in the collaboration and use of market knowledge . Our results suggest that KIMs are not without costs of implementation , which could trap the unwary and thus lead to less effective use of market knowl - edge and cross - functional collaboration . Limitations and Future Research Directions This study has several limitations that should be considered in the interpretations of the findings . First , we used cross - sectional data , which cannot suggest causal relationships . In particular , if the theoretical lens is organizational learning and knowledge creation , it could be theorized that KIMs are antecedents to the dimensions of market knowledge we dis - cussed here ( e . g . , Zahra , Ireland , and Hitt 2000 ) . However , our focus was on knowledge integration viewed from a structural contingency theory lens and , more specifically , on the view of knowledge as a contingency variable ( Birkin - shaw , Nobel , and Ridderstråle 2002 ; Germain and Droge 1997 ; Olson , Walker , and Ruekert 1995 ) . This perspective suggests that the type of knowledge determines the nature of coordination mechanisms for knowledge integration ( Galbraith 1973 ) . Future studies based on the former lens could examine how KIMs affect the dimensions of market knowledge . Second , the generalizability of the results is limited because we used data from a sample of firms in China . Third , extant research ( Olson , Walker , and Ruekert 1995 ; Sobek , Liker , and Ward 1998 ) and contingency theory describe several integrative mechanisms ( Galbraith 1973 ) that we did not consider here and should be investigated in further research for their ability to leverage market knowl - edge in product innovation . Fourth , our exclusive focus on market knowledge is a limitation , given the role of techno - logical knowledge in product innovation . A more explicit incorporation of the nature of technological knowledge along the dimensions used for market knowledge in future studies may provide a better understanding of knowledge integration and product innovation performance . Fifth , although we controlled for several factors that account for variance in firms’ growth , market power , and technological skills ( i . e . , firm size , slack , environmental conditions , and radical innovation ) , we did not include some potentially influential covariates that have been con - sidered in previous studies , such as industry maturity ( Eisenhardt and Tabrizi 1995 ) , company age ( Sinkula 1994 ) , and R & D strength ( Li and Calantone 1998 ) . This might limit the definitive evaluation of the relative impor - tance of the antecedents of KIMs and product innovation performance in the current study , and it offers a chance for future researchers to take steps in this direction . Finally , two of our scales , market knowledge breadth and KIMs , did not 108 / Journal of Marketing , January 2007 meet the . 50 threshold for AVE , suggesting the need for fur - ther scale development . In addition to alleviating these lim - itations , there are other fertile avenues for further research . First , our study highlights the key role of market knowl - edge characteristics in enhancing KIMs and product inno - vation performance and underscores the central importance accorded to knowledge and its integration in the concept of market orientation . However , despite the numerous studies on market orientation , scholars are yet to recognize the dis - tinctions among different knowledge characteristics espoused in the KBV . We argue that market - oriented firms may differ with respect to the type of market knowledge they collect and use in their product innovation processes . Thus , we suggest that two firms with the same degree of market orientation that have differential levels of market knowledge breadth , depth , tacitness , and specificity could display markedly different effectiveness in product innova - tion . This implies that examining the role of market orienta - tion in product innovation without isolating and accounting for the fine details of market knowledge characteristics may lead to an incomplete understanding or even misleading results . Second , our findings underscore the need for researchers to examine factors that may be more proximate antecedents of product innovation performance and , thus , potential drivers of the effect of cross - functional collabora - tion . Researchers need to move past their exclusive focus on the direct effects of cross - functional collaboration and begin to examine factors that may moderate or mediate its role in product innovation . These include different types of firm internal and external environments , such as internal com - mitment and competitive uncertainty ( Song and Parry 1997 ) ; different managerial styles ; different routines in the product innovation process , such as product standards and market definition ( Dougherty 1992 ) ; different functional relationship experiences ; and so forth . Indeed , with the exception of Maltz and Kohli ( 2000 ) , we and other scholars in the marketing literature seem to have a positive bias toward cross - functional collaboration . However , cross - functional collaboration involves potential bottlenecks , such as functional competition , conflicts , and personality differ - ences . Although not exhaustive , these aspects point to important opportunities for further research to provide a deeper examination of how cross - functional relationships and knowledge affect innovation . The results of this study , along with those in previous studies , suggest that there is little understanding of the value of tacit knowledge . McEvily and Chakravarthy ( 2002 ) indicate that tacitness may involve two dimensions : charac - teristic ambiguity and linkage ambiguity , the former dimen - sion being an antecedent of the latter dimension . Given the KBV’s arguments that tacitness is a key factor that could erect imitation barriers to protect the firm’s advantage , research is needed on whether these two dimensions apply to market knowledge and whether they offer similar or dif - ferential advantages in product innovation . Finally , further research should examine more closely the dynamic inter - play between market knowledge characteristics and techno - logical knowledge characteristics in the linkage between cross - functional collaboration and KIMs in product innova - tion . We believe that given the potential synergies between market and technological knowledge in product innovation , further research should tease out subtler , but still important , combined effects of the different characteristics of these kinds of firm knowledge . In conclusion , this study challenges researchers and managers to take a more sophisticated assessment of how and why market knowledge and cross - functional collabora - tion affect product innovation outcomes . We believe that by delineating the differential relative effects of the dimensions of market knowledge and cross - functional collaboration and by showing the dual mediating and moderating roles of KIMs , this study illuminates in a more systematic way how such a goal can be achieved . With additional work that builds on this study and incorporates the role of technologi - cal knowledge , a more comprehensive account of the com - plexity of the processes by which firms develop successful product innovations can be achieved .
