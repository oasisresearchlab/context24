Technological Resources and the Direction of Corporate Diversification : Toward an Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics Brian S . Silverman Harvard Business School , Morgan Hall 243 , Soldiers Field , Boston , Massachusetts 02163 bsilverman @ hbs . edu T his study considers how a firm ' s resource base affects the choice of industries into which the firm diversifies . It offers two main extensions of prior research . First , it operationalizes technological resources at a more detailed level than in prior studies , thereby enabling a more stringent analysis of the direction of diversification . This analysis shows that the predictive power of the " resource - based view of the firm " is greatly improved when resources are measured at a finer level . Second , the study integrates principles from transaction cost economics into resource - based predictions concerning diversification . In particular , it tests the common assumption that rent - generating resources are too asset specific to allow contracting . The findings point to circumstances where resources can be and are exploited through contracting rather than through diversification . ( Diversification ; Resource - Based View ; Transaction Cost Economics ; Patents ) 1 . Introduction Despite recent reports to the contrary , corporate di - versification remains a ubiquitous feature of the mod - ern economic landscape ( Montgomery 1994 ) . In the last decade , the resource - based view of the firm has been touted as particularly well suited to understand - ing diversification . Nevertheless , the operationaliza - tion of this framework has been limited to broad characterization of resources and the industries in which they might be fruitfully applied . For example , empirical studies have focused on proxies such as R & D spending to measure technological resources , finding that firms that exhibit high R & D intensities tend to diversify into industries that also exhibit high R & D intensities . While informative , this is substan - tially different from theoretical expositions of the resource - based view ( e . g . , Wernerfelt 1984 , Barney 1986 ) and related research into " technological compe - tence " ( e . g . , Patel and Pavitt 1994 ) , which suggest that a particular technological resource is useful in only a narrow range of applications . Put another way , the empirical research on the resource - based view can not predict whether a pharmaceutical firm is more likely to enter biotechnology or electronic data processing , both of which exhibit similar R & D intensities . In addition , the resource - based approach to diver - sification has generally under emphasized the possi - bility that firms can exploit resources through market arrangements rather than through expansion of cor - porate boundaries ( exceptions include Teece 1980 , 1982 ) . Transaction cost economics suggests that man - agers ( and scholars ) should consider alternate contrac - tual methods by which a firm can exploit its resources .

This study extends previous research in two ways . Empirically , it operationalizes technological resources at a more fine - grained level than has been done in prior resource - based research . This facilitates the inte - gration of elements of the technological competence and resource - based literatures to shed additional light on firms ' diversifying behavior , and supports more stringent testing of diversification directionality than in previous research . Theoretically , by stressing the links between transaction cost economics and the resource - based view , it examines and tests the as - sumption that rent - generating resources are necessar - ily too asset specific to allow contracting . 2 . The Resource - Based View of Diversification During the last fifteen years , scholars have developed a resource - based framework for analyzing business strategy . Drawing heavily on Penrose ( 1959 ) , the re - source - based framework suggests that the firm is best viewed as a collection of sticky and imperfectly imi - table resources or capabilities that enable it to success - fully compete against other firms ( Wernerfelt 1984 , Barney 1986 ) . These resources can be physical , such as unique equipment or innovations protected by pat - ents , or intangible , such as brand equity or operating routines . Of particular importance is the application - specificity inherent in such resources . The same char - acteristics that enable a firm to extract a sustainable rent stream from these assets often make it nearly impossible for the firm to " transplant " them or utilize them effectively in a new context . Thus , a firm that has developed an advantageous resource position is pro - tected to the extent that its resources are specific to certain applications ; at the same time , this specificity constrains the firm ' s ability to transfer these resources to new applications ( Montgomery and Wemerfelt 1988 ) . Operationalization of Resources Empirical research on diversification has typically followed one of two paths to operationalize resources . The first avenue rests on the assumption that more " related " diversification supports more extensive ex - ploitation of application - specific resources than does unrelated diversification . Most studies in this vein have relied on proximity within the SIC system to measure the degree of relatedness between two indus - tries ( e . g . , Montgomery and Wernerfelt 1988 ) . The second avenue relies on R & D intensity , advertising intensity , and other such investments as proxies for underlying resources . Montgomery and Hariharan ( 1991 ) find that firms tend to diversify into industries that have R & D intensities , advertising intensities , and capital expenditure intensities similar to those of the firms ' existing businesses . They also find that higher R & D intensities and advertising intensities are associ - ated with more diversification , and interpret this as evidence that R & D and marketing activity creates transferable resources that provide competitive ad - vantage . ' Each of these constructs is subject to criticism . Any measure of industry relatedness that relies on proxim - ity among SIC codes necessarily rests on strong as - sumptions about the ordering of the SIC system . SIC - based constructs typically rely on categorical de - cision rules ( such as " 1 if in same 2 - digit industry , 0 otherwise " ) that assume that each SIC code is equidis - tant from all other codes - in other words , as Gollop and Monahan ( 1991 ) note , the chemical industry ( SIC 28 ) is equally " distant " from petroleum ( SIC 29 ) and nonelectrical machinery ( SIC 35 ) . Such measures also assume that 3 - or 4 - digit industries within a single 2 - digit SIC are equally " similar " to each other . The use of such measures for a resource - based test are of particular concern , because the SIC system is based on product ( output ) characteristics rather than on re - source ( input ) characteristics . It is therefore unclear whether proximate 3 - or 4 - digit SIC codes actually share common or similar resource use patterns . A corollary concern exists regarding the fungibility 1 The Montgomery and Hariharan study builds on a long tradition in the economics and management literature ( e . g . , Gort 1962 , Lemelin 1982 ) . 1110 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics of R & D and advertising intensity . The theoretical development of the resource - based view has explicitly emphasized the specificity of application of rent - gen - erating resources . Montgomery and Wemerfelt ( 1988 ) argue that a resource ' s rent - generating capacity should be inversely related to its range of useful applications , suggesting that potentially valuable re - sources can realize this value in only a few applica - tions . This view is echoed by research into " techno - logical competence , " which has found evidence of stable and highly focused areas of corporate techno - logical strength ( Pavitt et al . 1989 ) and high correlation between the primary business in which a firm oper - ates and the set of technological areas in which it patents ( Patel and Pavitt 1994 ) . 2 Yet the proxies used in the resource - based empirical research do not cap - ture these constraints . Three recent studies have focused explicitly on underlying resource requirements across industries to examine diversification patterns . Farjoun ( 1994 ) uses census data to operationalize industry relatedness as the degree to which two industries use the same types and proportions of human expertise . He finds that a firm tends to diversify into industries that rely on patterns of expertise similar to those required in its extant industries . Coff and Hatfield ( 1995 ) use similar data in a study of acquisition announcements , finding evidence of higher returns for acquisitions that are more " related " in terms of human expertise . Robins and Wiersema ( 1995 ) use Scherer ' s technology inflow - outflow matrix to operationalize industry relatedness as the degree to which two industries rely on the same inflows of technology , finding that corporate perfor - mance is higher for firms that have diversified into technologically related industries than those that have diversified into technologically unrelated industries . However , these three studies characterize resources only at the industry level ; they do not have informa - 2 Jaffe ' s research into " technological position " ( 1986 , 1989 ) similarly suggests that firms are able to alter the direction of their technolog - ical strengths only gradually . Jaffe also finds that firms benefit from " nearby " R & D far more than from " distant " R & D , suggesting severe limits on the fungibility of technological knowledge - an implication that is consistent with Scott and Pascoe ' s ( 1987 ) study of " purposive diversification " in R & D . tion on firms ' repositories of expertise or technology . Focusing on industry aggregate data precludes the analysis of interfirm differences in resource pools and diversification patterns . This in turn limits these stud - ies ' ability to address issues relating to heterogeneity in firms ' resource bases . As shown below , identifica - tion of individual firms ' resource portfolios allows development of more nuanced insights into the role of resources in diversification , and more fully - developed integration of resource - based insights with those of other approaches . Below I construct a measure of corporate technolog - ical resources , based on patent data , that arguably captures more effectively than R & D intensity the narrow range of businesses in which a firm ' s techno - logical resources can be profitably applied . Following the logic of the resource - based theorists , I expect that a firm will more readily diversify into industries in which its portfolio of technological resources will confer competitive advantage . HYPOTHESIS 1 . Ceteris paribus , afirm is more likely to diversify into a business the more applicable its existing technological resources are to that business ( in absolute terms ) . This hypothesis differs from those tested in the above - cited empirical tests of diversification , which have hypothesized that a firm will be more likely to diversify into a business the more similar its R & D intensity is to the R & D intensity of the business . In effect , I expect that addition of more accurate mea - sures of technical resources and the businesses in which they provide value will significantly improve the explanation of corporate diversification patterns . A firm is constrained in the amount of entry it can pursue in a given time period due to limitations on managerial time ( Penrose 1959 ) . In the face of such constraint , it will select among its potential viable entries according to the degree to which its resources provide advantage in each industry ( Montgomery and Wemerfelt 1988 ) . A higher applicability of a firm ' s technological resources to a given business , relative to the applicability of its technological strengths to other businesses , should increase the likelihood that the firm enters the given business . MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 1111 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics HYPOTHESIS 2 . Ceteris paribus , a firm is more likely to diversify into a business the more applicable its existing technological resources are to that business , relative to other opportunities facing the firm . Hypothesis 2 differs from Hypothesis 1 in its focus on relative as opposed to absolute applicability of technological resources . Put another way , while Hy - pothesis 1 only considers the applicability of a firm ' s resources to a focal industry , Hypothesis 2 introduces into the decision calculus the applicability of a firm ' s resources to other industries that the firm might enter . Diversification vs . Contracting Out Resources : The Role of Appropriability As stated above , the resource - based view is based heavily on Penrose ' s theory of firm growth ( 1959 ) . The Penrosian framework is usefully informed by transac - tion cost economics . Penrose implicitly assumes that exploitation of excess resources necessitates their use within the firm . As a logical consequence , her frame - work is unidirectional - firms grow , but never shrink ; firms acquire , but never divest . 3 The transaction cost perspective asks whether there are alternate ways to utilize these assets , including outside contracting and spinoffs ( Teece 1980 ) . Transaction cost economics also offers a rationale for the potential benefits of contract - ing out excess resources ( incentive intensity ) and suggests circumstances in which such resources will be better spun off from the company ( Teece 1982 , Williamson 1985 ) . Resource - based theorists have traditionally ac - knowledged some insights of transaction cost eco - nomics , but have not tested their implications . Mont - gomery and Hariharan ( 1991 ) explicitly assume that the resources they investigate - technical and market - ing skills - are difficult to transfer , and Montgomery ( 1994 ) contends that resources to which rent accrues are likely to be difficult to contract out . Chatterjee and Wernerfelt ( 1991 ) implicitly assume that the techno - logical and marketing resources for which R & D inten - sity and advertising intensity are proxies can not be exploited through contracting out . 3 Mahoney and Pandian ( 1992 , p . 367 , ffi . 7 ) note that while the resource - based view predicts growth and diversification , " a ' resource - based theory of divestment ' is clearly lacking . " Yet it is not clear that this assumption is valid . Several empirical and theoretical studies have identi - fied conditions under which technological resources can be exploited through contractual means . Teece ( 1986 ) proposes that licensing is a feasible alternative to diversification unless technological knowledge is either highly tacit - in which case contracts calling for effort associated with knowledge transfer are difficult to monitor and enforce - or easily transferable and weakly protected - in which case attempts to negoti - ate a license are fraught with problems associated with the paradox of information and secrecy is required to appropriate returns to technology . Levin et al . ( 1987 ) find wide variation in the efficacy of licensing techno - logical innovations across industries , which they cite as evidence of varying levels of transaction costs across these industries . To the extent that licensing is a feasible alternative to diversification for a given technology in a given business , the likelihood of diversification into that business should be moder - ated . HYPOTHESIS 3 . Ceteris paribus , a firm is more likely to diversify into a business the more likely that contracting out its technological resources in that business is subject to high contractual hazards . a : Ceteris paribus , afirm is more likely to diversify into a business as the feasibility of licensing its technological resources in that business decreases . b : Ceteris paribus , afirm is more likely to diversify into a business as the needfor secrecy to appropriate returns to its technological resources in that business increases . c : Ceteris paribus , afirm is more likely to diversify into a business as the degree of tacit knowledge associated with its technological resources in that business increases . 3 . Data and Specification of the Model The empirical test of the above hypotheses entailed estimating the entry of existing firms into new SICs during the three - year window 1982 - 1985 as a function of firm , industry , and resource characteristics in 1981 . While study of a more recent time period would be desirable , focusing on the early - to mid - 1980s allows 1112 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics me to integrate information from several previously unlinked data sources . My sample of firms is largely a subset of the database compiled by Jaffe ( 1986 ) for his research into " technological position . " Jaffe ' s data - base , which is itself a subset of the NBER R & D Master File , includes 573 U . S . firms existing between 1973 and 1980 . Of these , 479 firms continued to appear in the Compustat database through 1985 . I generated my sample by selecting randomly ( using Excel ' s random number generator ) 344 of these 479 firms . 4 To reduce the emphasis on large , technology - intensive firms inherent in the Jaffe database , I then selected ran - domly 68 firms from the population of firms that 1 ) appeared in the 1981 and 1985 Compustat and 2 ) did not appear in Jaffe ' s database . 5 The resulting sample encompassed a wide range of U . S . economic activity : Of the 449 four - digit manufacturing industries , 433 were represented by at least one firm in the sample in 1981 . Sample firms participated in anywhere from one SIC ( several firms ) to 84 SICs ( ITT ) , with a median of 10 SICs . I relied on patent data to identify each firm ' s technological resource base . In recent years , patent data has been increasingly used as an indicator of corporate technological capabilities in management research ( Jaffe 1986 , Patel and Pavitt 1994 , Mowery et al . 1996 ) . Detailed information exists concerning every patented innovation , whether assigned to a public or private firm . Among the data available is a classification code that identifies the type of tech - nology embodied in the patent . Thus , compared to R & D expenditures , patents offer richer information on the particular range of technological strengths possessed by a firm . 4 Although inclusion of all 479 Jaffe firms would raise fewer concerns about my sample , time and resource constraints precluded this . My reliance on a randomly selected 344 - firm subset should yield unbiased results ; a difference of means test between my sample and the Jaffe firms that I excluded indicates no significant difference between the two sets of firms except for R & D intensity ( my sample has a lower R & D intensity than the set of excluded firms ) . 5 I selected 68 " non - Jaffe " firms because this provides a sample of minimum sufficient size to estimate state - based logit models on the non - Jaffe - only subset . I estimated such models in my dissertation ( Silverman 1996 ) . At the same time , patent data have limitations of their own . Much of a firm ' s technical knowledge may remain unpatented either because it is unpatentable ( e . g . an algorithm ) or because a firm may choose not to patent a patentable innovation . Differences in the comprehensiveness of patenting may exist across firms , industries , and time . In addition , there is vari - ation in the technological and economic value embod - ied in individual patents . In response to these concerns , Patel and Pavitt ( 1994 ) argue that codified ( patented ) knowledge and uncodi - fied knowledge are highly complementary . They point out that other measures of technological competence that incorporate tacit knowledge , such as peer review judg - ments , have been shown to yield similar results to those of patent measures ( Narin et al . 1987 ) . While patents do not directly measure a firm ' s noncodifiable knowledge , they should function as a partial , noisy indicator of its unpatented technological resources . To the extent that patents do not accurately measure corporate technolog - ical capabilities , the coefficients for the technological resource variables in this study will be biased down - ward ( toward insignificance ) . I used the MicroPatent database , which includes the front page of every patent granted by the U . S . Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) since 1975 , to con - struct each firm ' s " patent portfolio . " For each firm in my sample , I identified all patents in the MicroPatent database for which applications were filed before December 31 , 1981 ( the patent literature typically uses date of application , rather than date of granting , as the date on which a firm has access to a patented technol - ogy ) . These patents comprise the firm ' s patent portfo - lio , and hence provide one measure of its existing technical resources , as of 1981 . Since large multiunit firms frequently assign patents to subsidiaries , I used the 1981 Who Owns Whom reference book to identify every subsidiary - domestic and foreign - of each firm in the sample . I was thus able to search the MicroPatent database for patents assigned to any of these parent or subsidiary names , and aggregate all patents at the parent level . The firms in this sample accounted for more than 70 , 000 patents - well over 50 % of all U . S . patents assigned to U . S . firms during MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 1113 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics this period - assigned to more than 1 , 500 patenting 6 entities . In addition to patent data , I used Compustat and the AGSM / Trinet Large Establishment Database ( Trinet ) to compile data on other firm characteristics , dis - cussed below . I also used the Annual Survey of Manu - factures and the FTC Line of Business Data to compile information on all four - digit SIC manufacturing in - dustries - that is , all 449 four - digit SIC industries between SIC 2000 and SIC 3999 . Lack of data ( usually R & D or advertising intensity ) necessitated the elimi - nation of 20 industries , yielding a final set of 429 potential destination industries . Dependent Variable The dependent variable , Divij , is derived from the Trinet database and is coded as a categorical variable : Divij = 1 if firm i enters industry j between 1981 and 1985 , and 0 otherwise . The Trinet database , which was compiled every other year between 1979 and 1989 , includes informa - tion on corporate ownership and four - digit SIC scope of operations for every establishment with twenty or more employees in the United States . Comparison with the Census of Manufactures indicates that Trinet encompasses roughly 95 % of all establishments that it should ; most of the omissions are likely to be of smaller firms , rather than the large corporations in my sample ( Voigt 1993 ) . By aggregating the Trinet estab - lishment data at the firm level , I determined all four - digit SICs in which my sample firms participated in 1981 and in 1985 . Any industry j in which firm i does not participate in 1981 is a potential destination industry in 1985 . Those potential destination indus - tries in which firm i does participate in 1985 are 6 The MicroPatent database , like other sources of patent data , is noisy in the coding of assignees . This is driven by two elements : First , there is no standard format to which an assignee ' s name must conform ; second , there are inevitably typographical errors and misspellings in the transcription of this information into the USPTO ' s files and into the Micropatent database . I searched for variations of all names , and for key character substrings , in an attempt to reduce the resulting noise . I also visually scanned all patent assignments to catch incorrect assignments . Nevertheless , some errors of both exclusion of relevant patents and inclusion of irrelevant ones may have occurred . entries , and are coded as 1 . Such entry can occur through either acquisition or internal expansion ; this study does not distinguish between the two modes ( see Silverman 1996 , Chapter 6 for an analysis of entry mode choice ) . Those potential destination industries in which firm i does not participate in 1985 are non - entries , and are coded as 0 . Entry occurred in 1 , 023 of the 170 , 721 potential entries in my sample ( 0 . 5 % ) , and nonentry occurred in 169 , 698 ( 99 . 5 % ) of the potential entries . 7 Sample firms ' diversifying entry ranged from zero SICs entered ( approximately 25 % of the firms ) to 37 SICs entered ( Cooper Industries ) , with a median of two entered SICs . Independent Variables - Measures of Technological Resource Applicability AbsTechi is defined as the absolute level of firm i ' s patent portfolio that is likely to be applicable to industry j . It is derived from firm i ' s patent portfolio as follows . First , I used the U . S . Patent Class - U . S . SIC concordance developed in Silverman ( 1996 ) to derive probability - weighted assignments to four - digit SICs for each patent in firm i ' s portfolio . This concordance takes advantage of the fact that the Canadian Patent Office ( CPO ) assigns each granted patent to both a patent class and to SICs in which the patented inno - vation is likely to be manufactured and used . It uses the frequency with which Canadian patents in each patent class are assigned to each SIC to create a probability distribution relating U . S . patent classes to U . S . SIC codes . For example , suppose that the CPO has granted 376 patents assigned to patent class i , and has assigned 138 of these patents to SIC j as the SIC of Use . Then any single patent assigned to patent class i 7 Potential entries = 412 firms X 429 industries - the 6 , 027 firm - industry pairs in which firms already participated in 1981 = 170 , 721 . I also re - estimated all results in this paper using a 3 - digit definition of industry . About 3 of my observations are eliminated during this reestimation , either because a firm may diversify into multiple 4 - digit SICs that fall within a single 3 - digit SIC , or because a potential entry at the 4 - digit level may not be a potential entry at the 3 - digit level . The results for 3 - digit SICs are virtually identical to the 4 - digit results presented in this paper , with the exception of the loss of significance for the appropriability variables . These results are available upon request . 1114 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics during this period has probability 0 . 37 ( 138 / 376 ) of being assigned to SIC of Use j . 8 Second , I aggregated these probability - weighted SIC assignments over firm i ' s entire patent portfolio to determine the total strength of firm i ' s technological resources , as measured by its patents , in each SIC . Formally , AbsTechi is a measure of application - spe - cific technological strength : AbsTechij = E Prob ( industry = j I patent = c ) * Nicf c where Nic equals the number of patents in firm i ' s portfolio assigned to U . S . Patent Class c . Hypothesis 1 proposes that a firm is more likely to diversify into a business as its technical strength applicable to that business increases . The coefficient for AbsTechi is therefore expected to be positive . RelTechi is defined as the applicability of firm i ' s patent portfolio to industry j , relative to the applica - bility of firm i ' s patent portfolio to other industries . It is derived from AbsTechi as follows : RelTechi = AbsTechij / max { AbsTechij } It was argued above that a firm faces constraints on the amount of entry it can pursue in a given time period . If this is true , then , as Hypothesis 2 pro - poses , the firm will select among its potential viable entries according to the degree to which its re - sources provide advantage in each industry . I there - fore expect that higher relative applicability of firm i ' s patent portfolio to industry j should increase the likelihood that firm i enters industry j , independent of the effects of absolute levels of applicability . The coefficient for RelTechi is therefore predicted to be positive . It is worth noting that while many re - 8 This concordance assumes that patents are assigned and exploited according to similar processes in the U . S . and Canada - not an unreasonable assumption , since more than 50 % of patents in Can - ada are assigned to U . S . firms . Full details as to the construction and testing of this concordance are available in Silverman ( 1996 ) or from the author upon request . Additional information also appears in the appendix of the working paper version of this article , which can be downloaded from http : / / www . ssrn . com . Note that this concordance is similar to the work of Evenson , Kortum , and Putnam at the two - digit SIC level in Canada ( e . g . , Kortum and Putnam 1989 ) . source - based theorists have hypothesized variations on Hypothesis 2 , the hypothesis has previously remained untested due to the difficulty of construct - ing sufficiently detailed empirical constructs . Independent Variables - Measures of Contractual Hazards Proxies for transaction cost - related hazards associated with contracting out innovations are derived from the Yale survey on research and development . In their survey of senior R & D executives at several hundred large U . S . firms in the early 1980s , Levin et al . ( 1987 ) asked each respondent to rate on a seven - point scale , for his / her line of business , the importance of several mechanisms for appropriating returns to innovation including licensing royalties , secrecy , and learning - curve advantages . Several scholars have used these to proxy for the overall strength of a given industry ' s appropriability regime , usually by taking the highest rating from across all mechanisms . In this study I use them individually to proxy for contracting hazards associated with exploiting innovation in a given in - dustry . Royaltyj is defined as the feasibility of licensing innovations in industry j . I assume that the more important license royalties are as a method of appro - priating returns to innovation in industry j , the lower the hazards and , hence , transaction costs associated with contracting for technology in industry j ( Levin et al . 1987 ) . Hypothesis 3a proposes that , in such indus - tries , firms will prefer to exploit their technical re - sources through contractual means rather than through expansion of their boundaries . Conversely , in industries where license royalties are not effective for appropriating returns , firms will have little alternative but to diversify if they are to exploit their technical resources . Thus , the coefficient for Royaltyj is expected to be negative . Secrecyj is defined as the importance of secrecy to appropriating returns to innovation in industry j . I assume that in industries where secrecy is impor - tant , contracting for technology is subject to hazards associated with concern about information leakage . Hypothesis 3b proposes that , in such industries , firms will rely on diversification rather than con - tracting to exploit their technological resources .

Learningj is defined as the importance of learning curve advantages to appropriating returns to innova - tion in industry j . I assume that in industries where learning curve advantages are efficacious , knowledge is sufficiently tacit that it does not leak out of the learning firm . Grindley and Teece ( 1997 ) have noted the hazards associated with contracting for technology when licensees will subsequently generate tacit knowledge concerning the licensed technology - for example , by making more difficult the monitoring and enforcement of " grant - back " provisions in which the licensee must transfer to the licensor all improvements to the licensed technology . 9 Hypothesis 3c proposes that , in such industries , firms will rely on diversifica - tion rather than contracting to exploit their technolog - ical resources . The coefficient for Learningj is therefore expected to be positive . ' In addition , much of the transaction cost literature on licensing discusses the hazards associated with a licensor ' s tacit knowledge . The current study does not directly address such hazards due to the difficulty of parameterizing tacit knowledge in a firm ' s existing businesses , as opposed to the industry of potential entry . Control Variables A number of control variables are included in the model . In addition to controlling for various firm , industry , and firm - industry relatedness characteristics that both theory and prior empirical research suggest will affect diversification behavior , inclusion of these variables facilitates the comparison of this study ' s results to those of prior resource - based research on diversification . Firm - level variables include firm size , growth , R & D intensity , and advertising intensity . In - dustry - level variables include industry size , growth , R & D intensity , and advertising intensity . Firm - indus - try relatedness measures include the difference be - tween firm i ' s R & D intensity and industry j ' s R & D intensity , and the difference between firm i ' s advertis - ing intensity and industry j ' s advertising intensity . Table 1 identifies the data source , measurement , and expected sign of each of these variables . As Table 1 indicates , the data for industry R & D and advertising intensities are taken from 1976 - 1977 , while all other data comes from 1981 - 1982 . The FTC Line of Business database is generally accepted as an unusually accu - rate source of information on U . S . industry character - istics . However , the FTC ceased production of this database after 1977 . I thus faced a choice between 1116 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics using a second - best source of industry data - such as attempting to construct industry averages from firm - level Compustat data - and using accurate industry data from a slightly different time frame than my other data . I opted for the latter ; thus an implicit assumption in this study is that industry - level R & D and advertising intensities did not change dramati - cally between 1978 and 1981 . The hypotheses enumerated in ? 2 can be tested in a model of entry into new markets . My model borrows from Montgomery and Hariharan ( 1991 ) . As did they , I look at changes in firm - level diversification as a function of firm characteristics , destination industry characteris - tics , and the relationship between firm and industry characteristics . I extend the model by including direct measures of the applicability of a firm ' s technical re - source base to potential destination industries as well as measures of the transaction cost hazards associated with contracting out vs . in - house exploitation of technical resources . 10 The resulting model is : P ( Divi . = 1 ) = go0 + f31AbsTechij + f2RelTechi1 + f3Royaltyj + f4Secrecyj + f5Learningj + f6IGrowthj + f37IConcj + f8IR & DIntj + g / IAdvlntj + f3OFSalesi + 311FGrowthi + f12FR & DIntj + f13FAdvInti + f14DiffR & Dij + 315DiffAdvIntij + ei1 . ' " I do not include a direct measure of industry profitability as did Montgomery and Hariharan because reliable data on industry profitability is not available for the time period covered by my data . However , this is not as severe a lack as it first appears . Most studies of diversification have not included an industry profit measure . More important , the two that have ( Montgomery and Hariharan 1991 , Orr 1974 ) both found that industry profitability has an insignificant effect on diversification entry when factors that are hypothesized to affect industry profitability ( industry concentra - tion , growth , R & D intensity , and advertising intensity ) are included as variables . I include these factors in my model . Table 2 presents the mean , standard deviation , minimum value , and maximum value of each vari - able . The values for AbsTech and RelTech indicate that both are highly skewed , which underscores the fact that there are many instances in which a firm has no technical resources ( as measured by patents ) that are applicable to a particular industry . Table 3 presents the correlation matrix for the variables . 4 . Logit Estimation : Results and Discussion The phenomenon under study is best described by a categorical variable - either entry takes place or it does not . Rather than use all 169 , 698 nonentries in my analysis , I used state - based sampling techniques to construct a sample of entries and nonentries . I derived a sample consisting of all entries and slightly less than one percent of nonentries ( the latter were selected using SAS ' s random number generator ) . Manski and McFadden ( 1981 ) have demonstrated that state - based sampling provides more efficient generation of infor - mation than does a purely random sample when a population is overwhelmingly characterized by one state , and that logit estimation using data derived Table 2 Descriptive Statistics of the Independent Variables an = 2514 ; bn = 1380 Variable ( units ) Mean Std .

Such observations could bias upward my technological resource coefficients . Following Gulati ( 1995 ) and Baum and Korn ( 1996 ) , I addressed this by running a sensitivity analysis in which I reesti - mated the models in this paper after eliminating from my sample any entry or nonentry that would constitute a " pioneering " entry , as follows . For each observation I identified all SICs in which firm i participated in 1981 . I then identified all other firms in my sample that participated in any of those SICs in 1981 . I then checked whether any of these firms also participated in industry j in 1981 . If not , then firm i ' s entry ( or nonentry ) into industry j was classified as a pioneering entry and excluded from the sample . This led to the exclusion of 75 entries and 314 nonentries . Results were essentially Effect of Technological Resource Applicability Measures The first set of logit estimations is presented in Table 4 , Models 1 - 3 ( elasticities appear in Table 5 ) . The results for the regression using only traditional mea - sures of entry barriers and firms ' resources ( model 1 ) are generally consistent with those of previous stud - ies . All variables are signed as expected . All variables except IGrowth1 are significant at p < 0 . 05 . The only surprise of this regression is the lack of significance for industry growth , which is commonly considered to be one of the primary influences on entry . Nevertheless , there is empirical precedent for this result ( Montgom - ery and Hariharan 1991 , Lemelin 1982 ) . Model 2 introduces AbsTechij , the absolute level of firm i ' s technological resource base that is applicable to industry j . AbsTechi is significant and positive , as predicted by Hypothesis 1 . Further , the likelihood ratio test indicates that inclusion of AbsTechi signifi - cantly improves the fit of the model ( X2 ( 1 ) = 134 . 24 ; p < 0 . 01 ) . At the same time , the coefficients for the identical to those reported in the paper , and are available on request . 1118 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics Table 4 Logit Estimation of Entry ( * * = p < 0 . 01 , * = p < 0 . 05 , + = p < 0 . 10 ) Test of Technical Resource Measures Test of Appropriability Effects ( N = 2514 ) ( N = 1380 ) ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) Intercept - 0 . 221 + - 0 . 228 + - 0 . 362 * * - 0 . 152 - 0 . 304 - 1 . 059 * ( 0 . 130 ) ( 0 . 134 ) ( 0 . 137 ) ( 0 . 178 ) ( 0 . 187 ) ( 0 . 494 ) IGrowth 0 . 014 + 0 . 009 0 . 009 0 . 001 0 . 002 - 0 . 004 ( 0 . 008 ) ( 0 . 008 ) ( 0 . 008 ) ( 0 . 009 ) ( 0 . 010 ) ( 0 . 010 ) IConc - 0 . 024 * * - 0 . 022 * * - 0 . 021 * * - 0 . 021 * * - 0 . 019 * * - 0 . 019 * * ( 0 . 002 ) ( 0 . 002 ) ( 0 . 003 ) ( 0 . 003 ) ( 0 . 003 ) ( 0 . 003 ) IR & DS 0 . 563 * * 0 . 464 * * 0 . 449 * * 0 . 572 * * 0 . 474 * * 0 . 464 * * ( 0 . 038 ) ( 0 . 039 ) ( 0 . 039 ) ( 0 . 049 ) ( 0 . 050 ) ( 0 . 050 ) lAdvS 0 . 069 * 0 . 061 + 0 . 062 * 0 . 1 15 * 0 . 1 13 * 0 . 103 * ( 0 . 032 ) ( 0 . 032 ) ( 0 . 033 ) ( 0 . 046 ) ( 0 . 047 ) ( 0 . 047 ) FSales 0 . 033 * * 0 . 01 6 * * 0 . 020 * * 0 . 058 * * 0 . 035 * * 0 . 037 * * ( 0 . 006 ) ( 0 . 006 ) ( 0 . 006 ) ( 0 . 013 ) ( 0 . 012 ) ( 0 . 012 ) FGrowth 0 . 016 * * 0 . 017 * * 0 . 016 * * 0 . 019 * * 0 . 017 * * 0 . 017 * * ( 0 . 004 ) ( 0 . 004 ) ( 0 . 004 ) ( 0 . 006 ) ( 0 . 006 ) ( 0 . 006 ) FR & DS 0 . 1 44 * * 0 . 051 0 . 079 * 0 . 1 35 * * 0 . 081 + 0 . 087 + ( 0 . 036 ) ( 0 . 037 ) ( 0 . 037 ) ( 0 . 047 ) ( 0 . 049 ) ( 0 . 049 ) FAdvS 0 . 1 10 * * 0 . 121 * * 0 . 1 15 * * 0 . 105 * 0 . 126 * * 0 . 125 * * ( 0 . 029 ) ( 0 . 030 ) ( 0 . 030 ) ( 0 . 044 ) ( 0 . 045 ) ( 0 . 046 ) DiffR & D - 0 . 451 * * - 0 . 369 * * - 0 . 371 * * - 0 . 444 * * - 0 . 371 * * - 0 . 375 * * ( 0 . 043 ) ( 0 . 044 ) ( 0 . 044 ) ( 0 . 055 ) ( 0 . 056 ) ( 0 . 057 ) DiffAdv - 0 . 177 * * - 0 . 168 * * - 0 . 165 * * - 0 . 210 * * - 0 . 214 * * - 0 . 21 1 * * ( 0 . 035 ) ( 0 . 036 ) ( 0 . 036 ) ( 0 . 053 ) ( 0 . 054 ) ( 0 . 054 ) AbsTech 0 . 191 * * 0 . 135 * * 0 . 131 * * 0 . 126 * * ( 0 . 026 ) ( 0 . 024 ) ( 0 . 030 ) ( 0 . 030 ) RelTech 3 . 950 * * 3 . 209 * * 3 . 232 * * ( 0 . 776 ) ( 0 . 859 ) ( 0 . 862 ) Royalty - 0 . 056 * ( 0 . 028 ) Secrecy 0 . 033 ( 0 . 033 ) Learning 0 . 088 * ( 0 . 043 ) Log - lklhd - 1453 . 54 - 1386 . 42 - 1368 . 67 - 796 . 06 - 747 . 68 - 743 . 24 Lklhd ratio test X2 ( 1 ) vs . model 1 X2 ( 1 ) vs . model 2 X2 ( 2 ) vs . model 4 x2 ( 3 ) vs . model 5 = 134 . 2 * * = 35 . 5 * * = 96 . 7 * * = 8 . 88 * other variables largely retain their magnitudes and levels of significance . I interpret the significance of AbsTech as support for Hypothesis 1 - firms are likely to diversify into those industries in which their exist - ing technological resources are highly applicable . Model 3 introduces RelTechij , the relative level of firm i ' s technological resource base that is applicable to industry j . RelTechi is positive and significant , as predicted by Hypothesis 2 , and the likelihood ratio test indicates that inclusion of RelTechi significantly improves the fit of the model ( X2 ( 1 ) = 35 . 50 ; p < 0 . 01 compared to model 2 ) . At the same time , the coeffi - cient for AbsTechi retains its magnitude and signifi - cance . The model is thus able to discern the separate effects of absolute and relative technological resource applicability despite the moderate correlation between these variables . Controlling for absolute levels of technological resource applicability , a firm is more MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 1119 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics likely to diversify into an industry the more applicable its technological resources are to that industry , relative to their applicability to other industries . I interpret this result as support for Hypothesis 2 . The inclusion of detailed measures of corporate technological resources and the industries in which they are useful significantly improves the explana - tory power of the resource - based model as com - pared to versions that rely on traditional proxies for resources . In addition to the likelihood ratio test result cited above , inclusion of AbsTechi and RelTe - chi , reduces the number of prediction errors by 10 % , from 762 in Model 1 to 680 in Model 3 . By way of comparison , addition of all variables except for these two technological resource measures to a model that consists only of a constant term reduces prediction errors by 26 % . Effect of Contractual Hazard Measures The second set of logit estimations are presented in Table 4 , Models 4 - 6 . As described above , measures of appropriability - the importance of licensing royalties , secrecy , and exploiting the learning curve - are de - rived from the Yale survey on R & D . This survey covers approximately half of the manufacturing SICs . Empirical tests involving these measures were conse - quently restricted to the 621 entries and 759 nonentries in the sample for which data was available . Models 4 and 5 recreate for this reduced sample the conven - tional resource - based model and the model incorpo - rating AbsTechi and RelTechi . Comparison with Models 1 and 3 indicates that results for the reduced sample are substantially similar to those for the com - plete sample . The primary difference is the insignifi - cance of FR & DInti in the reduced sample results , due to the higher standard error associated with the de - creased number of observations . Model 6 introduces the three contractual hazard mea - sures , Royaltyj , Secrecyj , and Learningj . As predicted by Hypothesis 3a , Royalty1 ' s coefficient is negative and significant , indicating that a firm is less likely to diversify into an industry when viable contractual alternatives exist to exploit its technological resources . The coefficient for Learningj is positive and significant , as predicted by Hypothesis 3c , which suggests that a firm is more likely to exploit its technological resources through diversifica - tion when those resources are characterized by cumula - tive , tacit knowledge , which makes their market transfer difficult and hazardous . The coefficient for Secrecyj is positive but not significant . The hypothesis that a firm is more likely to exploit its technological resources through diversification when those resources are subject to con - tracting hazards due to expropriation risks associated with information revelation ( H3b ) is thus not supported . Inclusion of all three variables significantly improves the fit of the model ( x2 ( 3 ) = 8 . 88 ; p < 0 . 05 ) . Effect on Estimated Probability of Diversification Logit estimation does not yield coefficients whose effects on the dependent variable can be directly interpreted . Since logit estimation is not a linear form , the effect of a change in an independent variable depends on the initial level of that variable and on the value of the other variables in the model . Formally , the change in probability of diversification associated with a change in an independent variable from x to x ' is calculated by : exp { , BX ' } exp { , BX } [ 1 + exp { , BX ' } ] [ 1 + exp { 1X } ] where X and X ' are vectors of all independent vari - ables in the model and X ' differs from X only in that the variable of concern equals x ' rather than x . The left half of Table 5 shows the effect on the estimated probability of diversifying entry for an in - crease in each independent variable from its mean to one standard deviation above the mean , conditional on all other variables being at their mean values . By way of illustration , consider a firm whose characteristics all happen to be equal to the sample ' s mean values ( e . g . , FSalesi = 3 . 737 ) . Suppose this firm may potentially enter two industries , jl and j2 , whose industry characteristics also happen to be equal to the sample ' s mean values ( e . g . , IGrowthj = 10 . 011 ) . Suppose that AbsTechij , hap - pens to be equal to the mean value for AbsTechij ( 3 . 020 ) , but that AbsTechi , 2 is equal to one standard deviation above this ( 22 . 279 ) . Then the probability that firm i diversifies into industry jl is 0 . 466 , while the probability that firm i diversifies into industry j2 is 0 . 917 . 13 13 These estimated probabilities are for the sample , not the popula - tion . The constant term has not been adjusted to account for 1120 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics Table 5 Changes in Estimated Probabilities of Entry Effect of Changing Independent Variable From Mean Value to 1 Effect of Changing Independent Variable From Median Value Standard Deviation Above the Mean to 3rd Quartile P ( EntrylVar .

As was discussed earlier , the technological resource measures are highly skewed . Since the changes in prob - ability described above use the mean and standard deviation of each independent variable , such skewness is likely to exaggerate the effect of these variables on probability of entry . The right half of Table 5 presents the change in probability of diversification associated with changing each independent variable from its median value to its third quartile value . The technological re - source variables have smaller effects when these values are used . This marked difference in effect on probability of entry between mean - standard deviation and median - third quartile measures exists because the vast majority of firm - industry pairs have extremely low levels of AbsTechi , . Such a difference is consistent with the re - source - based view , which is predicated on the notion that rent - generating resources , while few and far be - tween , are significant to firm decision - making when they exist . state - based sampling . For the population , the probability of entry when all variables are set to their means is less than 0 . 01 , rising to slightly more than 0 . 09 when AbsTechi is increased by one standard deviation . Further Exploration of Diversification Direction : Industry of Manufacture vs . Industry of Use A patent can be assigned to both the industry in which it is used ( SIC of Use ) and , if it is a product patent , to the industry in which it is manufactured ( SIC of Manufac - ture ) . AbsTechi and RelTechi are calculated based on equal weightings of both assignments . This implicitly assumes that a firm is as likely to exploit its technological resources by entering an industry in which it can man - ufacture its patented technology as it is by entering an industry in which it can use its technology . I tested this assumption by constructing alternate measures of Ab - sTech and RelTech , based solely on SIC of Use or on SIC of Manufacture ( AbsTechU / RelTechU and AbsTechM / RelTechM , respectively ) . These tests , available from the author , indicate that the assumption is correct : For the entire sample , no alternate specification of technological resource applicability significantly improves on the mea - sure used above . Nevertheless , it is possible that for certain subsets of industries or technologies one of these technology exploitation routes dominates corporate diversifica - tion behavior - that firms tend to enter the business in which their technology can be used rather than where MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 1121 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resouirce - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics Table 6 SIC of Use and SIC of Manufacture Variables ( as function of source of innovation ) Statistically significant Technological measures improvement over Type of Industry N offering best fita next - best model ? b User - dominated 373 entries ; AbsTechMfre ; Yes ( p < 0 . 01 ) 399 nonentries RelTechMfre Supplier - dominated 300 entries ; AbsTechUse ; Yes ( p < 0 . 05 ) ( equipment suppliers ) 422 nonentries RelTechUse Supplier - dominated 356 entries ; AbsTech ; No ( materials suppliers ) 404 nonentries RelTech Non - dominated 181 entries ; AbsTech ; No 224 nonentries RelTech a As measured by log - likelihood . bAs measured by likelihood ratio test . it can be manufactured , or vice versa . Pavitt ( 1984 ) and Pavitt et al . ( 1989 ) typologize industries by their primary source ( s ) of technological innovation . " Sup - plier - dominated " industries are those that derive most of their innovations from upstream suppliers . A sec - ond category of industries is characterized by the need for user input to the innovation process . ( For some - what obscure reasons , Pavitt et al . categorize this category as " specialized supplier " industries . I prefer to term them " user - dominated " industries for clarity . ) Pavitt and his colleagues postulate that supplier - dominated industries are vulnerable to technology - based forward integration by upstream firms . Simi - larly , user - dominated industries are vulnerable to technology - driven backward integration . If supplier - dominated industries are indeed prey to forward integration by innovative suppliers , then for such industries one would expect entry to be more strongly explained by SIC of Use than by SIC of Manu - facture . If user - dominated industries are subject to back - ward integration by innovative users , then for such indus - tries entry should be more strongly explained by SIC of Manufacture than by SIC of Use . Using these two catego - ries from the Pavitt et al . typology , I test this below . The Yale survey asked respondents to rate the impor - tance of several sources of innovation in their respective industries , including material suppliers , equipment sup - pliers , and users . I categorized those industries for which the importance of material suppliers or equipment sup - pliers as sources of innovation was rated above the mean as supplier - dominated industries . 14 Those industries for which the importance of users as sources of innovation was rated above the mean were categorized as user - dominated industries . Industries with below - average ratings for the importance of suppliers and users were categorized as non - dominated . For each of these indus - try categories , I reestimated model 3 using three differ - ent measures of technological resource applicability : 1 ) AbsTech and RelTech ; 2 ) AbsTechU and RelTechU ; and 3 ) AbsTechM and RelTechM . Rather than present the entire estimation results , which remain substantially the same across all runs , Table 6 identifies which specification of technological resource applicability offers the best fit for each indus - try category , as measured by the chi - square statistic . As the Table shows , and consistent with Pavitt et al . ( 1989 ) , SIC of Manufacture provides the best fit for user - dominated industries . The SIC of Use measure provides the best fit for equipment supplier - domi - nated industries , although not for material supplier - dominated industries . The combined Use and Manu - facture measure provides the best fit for industries that are neither user - nor supplier - dominated . These results provide at least crude empirical support for the contention by Pavitt and his colleagues that the direction of technology - based entry varies across indus - 14 Alternate cutoffs such as the third quartile generated similar results , although significance was reduced due to the lower number of observations . 1122 MANAGEMENT SCIENCE / Vol . 45 , No . 8 , August 1999 SILVERMAN Integration of the Resource - Based View and Transaction Cost Economics tries as the primary source of innovation varies . They also provide a cautionary counterbalance to studies emphasizing the benefits of relying on users or suppliers as sources for new innovations . Von Hippel ( 1988 ) has detailed a number of industries in which users develop and prototype new innovations that manufacturers then commercialize . Teece ( 1992 ) has suggested that such symbiotic relationships with users or suppliers can un - derpin vertical collaborative ventures . The above results suggest , however , that managers should not be too sanguine about the potential competitive implications of user or supplier technological capabilities . 5 . Conclusion This study is the first attempt of which I am aware to examine the effects of firms ' heterogeneous technologi - cal resources as measured by patent data on diversifica - tion behavior . It is also the first study to examine empirically the frequently voiced , but previously un - tested , hypothesis that firms prioritize their diversifica - tion options according to the relative applicability of their resources across these options . Finally , it is the first study to explicitly examine empirically the role of transaction costs on diversification in the context of the resource - based view of the firm . The results suggest that a firm ' s technological resource base , as manifested in its corpo - rate patent portfolio , significantly influences its diversi - fication decisions . In particular , a firm elects to enter markets in which it can exploit its existing technological resources and in which its existing resource base is strongest . In addition , a firm ' s diversification decision is influenced by the severity of hazards surrounding con - tractual alternatives to diversification . Finally , the results suggest that , as Pavitt and colleagues have conjectured , the source of innovation in an industry indicates the direction of likely diversifying entry into that industry . In addition to using the resource - based view to shed light onto diversification , this study has used the phe - nomenon of diversification to shed light on the resource - based view . First , resource - based empirical research has lagged its theoretical counterpart in the operationaliza - tion of sufficiently detailed , application - specific mea - sures of firms ' resources . This has restricted the scope of the framework ' s empirical research agenda , and perhaps has biased downward the apparent empirical signifi - cance of resources to firm behavior and performance . The powerful effect of technological resources on diver - sification identified in this study suggests that similar operationalization of other resources may further reveal the power of the resource - based view . Second , the resource - based view remains at odds with transaction cost economics over perceived differences in the feasibility of using markets to exploit rent - generating assets ( Montgomery and Hariharan 1991 ) and , more recently , over the role of opportunism and motivation of hazard mitigation as determinants of organization form ( Chi 1994 , Argyres 1996 , Conner and Prahalad 1996 ) . This study ' s integration of transaction cost reasoning into the resource - based view suggests that while con - flicts between the two theories do exist , the strong complementarities between them should not be ignored . Finally , this study has developed and used a new measure of a firm ' s technological resource base . Al - though similar in spirit to prior patent - based measures of " technological position " ( e . g . , Jaffe 1986 ) , the measure developed herein is able to link a firm ' s position to product markets where its technological strength is likely to offer commercial advantage . Future research could entail elaboration of this measure to inform a wide range of research questions , including stock market valuation of patented technology ( e . g . , Cockburn and Griliches 1988 ) and broader issues of corporate gover - nance and scope ( e . g . , Lang and Stulz 1992 ) . 15 15 I gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Sloan Foundation , the Connaught Foundation , and the Social Sci - ences and Humanities Research Council .
