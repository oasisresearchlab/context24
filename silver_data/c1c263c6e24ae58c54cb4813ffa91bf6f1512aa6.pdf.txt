0123456789 ( ) ; : A hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the elaborate membrane system that serves to create physically and functionally distinct organelles , which enable cells to compartmen - talize metabolic networks and signalling cascades 1 . Different membrane - bounded organelles , such as the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , the Golgi complex , endosomes and lysosomes , or the plasma membrane , exchange macromolecules between them via vesicu - lar and tubular carriers in processes of internalization ( endocytosis ) and secretion ( exocytosis ) . Many orga - nelles can also form membrane contact sites ( MCSs ) between each other to enable non - vesicular exchange of lipids , ions and metabolites 2 , 3 . Finally , organelles undergo fusion and fission as well as maturation pro - cesses that underlie the cell physiological response to changing environmental conditions , such as starvation or stress . These processes , collectively referred to as ‘membrane dynamics’ , require a finely tuned regulation of the interaction of proteins with membranes . Over the past few decades , it has become clear that phos - phoinositides — that is , phosphorylated derivatives of the myo - inositol - containing membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ; Fig . 1a , b ) — are key deter - minants of compartmental membrane identity and act as spatiotemporal cues to direct membrane dynamics 4 – 6 . For example , PtdIns 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 ) P ) acts as marker lipid that recruits key cytosolic proteins to early endosomes to define their identity 4 , 6 , 7 . PtdIns is synthesized in the ER and is delivered to other organelles via lipid exchange proteins at MCSs and by vesicular or tubular carriers that move along the secretory pathway and within the endolysosomal system 4 . Reversible phosphorylation and dephospho - rylation of the inositol ring by phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases generate seven distinct phospho - inositide species . These species can be interconverted depending on the enzymatic activity , resulting in a met - abolic network with multiple interdependencies ( Fig . 1b ) . Phosphoinositides constitute less than 1 % of the total phospholipid pool of cells , yet exhibit a highly localized subcellular distribution as a result of the tight spatiotem - poral control of their synthesis and turnover 4 ( Fig . 1c ) . This directly impacts on the localization and activity of cytosolic effector proteins and membrane - integral proteins such as receptors , ion channels or transporters that interact with these lipids and elicit a physiological response ( for example , a signalling cascade or assem - bly of a protein complex that can remodel membranes ) . Phosphoinositide - binding domains of effector proteins generally bind to their target lipid with low affinity . As a result , multivalent coincident recognition of addi - tional factors , including small GTP - binding proteins and other lipids , as well as avidity effects caused by the presence of multiple lipid - binding sites or domains on effector proteins are required for their function 1 , 4 , 6 . Dual , coincident recognition of lipids and proteins also underlies the observed compartment specificity of phosphoinositide - binding domain - based lipid biosen - sors ( Box 1 ; TaBle 1 ) . An evolutionary advantage of this organizational principle is that each component of the Endosomes Membrane - bound compart - ments on the endocytic route that can be distinguished as early , late and recycling endo - somes . early endosomes act as sorting stations and are marked by RaB5 and phos - phatidylinositol 3 - phosphate . They can mature into RaB7 - positive late endosomes ( also called ‘multivesicular bodies’ ) by inward budding . Recycling endosomes are tubular in nature and recycle cargo to the cell surface . Phosphoinositides as membrane organizers York Posor , Wonyul Jang and Volker Haucke ✉ Abstract | Phosphoinositides are signalling lipids derived from phosphatidylinositol , a ubiquitous phospholipid in the cytoplasmic leaflet of eukaryotic membranes . Initially discovered for their roles in cell signalling , phosphoinositides are now widely recognized as key integrators of mem - brane dynamics that broadly impact on all aspects of cell physiology and on disease . The past decade has witnessed a vast expansion of our knowledge of phosphoinositide biology . On the endocytic and exocytic routes , phosphoinositides direct the inward and outward flow of mem - brane as vesicular traffic is coupled to the conversion of phosphoinositides . Moreover , recent findings on the roles of phosphoinositides in autophagy and the endolysosomal system challenge our view of lysosome biology . The non - vesicular exchange of lipids , ions and metabolites at mem - brane contact sites in between organelles has also been found to depend on phosphoinositides . Here we review our current understanding of how phosphoinositides shape and direct mem - brane dynamics to impact on cell physiology , and provide an overview of emerging concepts in phosphoinositide regulation .

PtdIns is depicted in the 1 - stearoyl ( R 1 ) , 2 - arachidonyl ( R 2 ) configuration , the most frequent acyl chain composition found in phosphoinositides . b | Phosphoinositide metabolism . Addition and removal of phosphate groups at the 3 ′ - hydroxy , 4 ′ - hydroxy and 5 ′ - hydroxy groups of PtdIns by phosphoinositide kinases ( blue ) and phosphatases ( red ) creates seven distinct phosphoinositide species . Enzymatic interconversion of phosphoinositides creates a network in which formation of one species depends on the availability of another , meaning that the cellular levels of certain phosphoinositides are inter - dependent . Phosphoinositides enriched in the endolysosomal system ( shaded yellow ) versus the secretory pathway and the plasma membrane ( shaded blue ) are indicated . c | Subcellular enrichment of phosphoinos - itides . The spatiotemporally controlled activity of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases creates a distinctive enrichment of phosphoinositides across the cellular compartments . The plasma membrane is highly enriched in PtdIns 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) . The Golgi apparatus and the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) are characterized by PtdIns 4 - phosphate ( PtdIns4P ) , which is also present at the plasma membrane . By contrast , the endosomal compartments are dominated by 3 ′ - phosphoinositides , with PtdIns 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns3P ) being the signature lipid of early endosomes . A fraction of PtdIns3P is converted to PtdIns 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) on late endosomes . Lysosomes are unique in having a diverse complement of phosphoinositides in their membranes , likely depending on their functional and metabolic state . On multiple endocytic routes , PtdIns 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) is formed on nascent endocytic carriers before conversion to PtdIns3P in endocytic vesicles .

The importance of phosphoinositides in cell physio - logy and dynamic remodelling of membranes is best illustrated by the ever - growing list of human diseases linked to dysfunction of phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes ( TaBles 2 , 3 ) . In spite of the apparent redun - dancy of phosphoinositide kinases ( TaBle 3 ) and phos - phatases ( TaBle 2 ) at the level of the biochemical reaction catalysed , mutation of specific isoforms of these enzymes gives rise to diseases with a surprisingly high level of tissue or cell - type selectivity 8 . These range from neuro - muscular , skeletal and kidney disorders caused by loss of function of phosphoinositide phosphatases ( for exam - ple , myotubularin family members , FIG4 and OCRL ) to overgrowth syndrome , immune deficiency and cancer as a result of hyperactivation of the class I Ptdins 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / AKT signalling pathway 5 , 9 . Pathogens , including bacteria and viruses , have also been found to exploit the regulatory potential of phosphoinositides for infection ( Supplementary Box 1 ) . In this Review we discuss how the spatiotemporally controlled conversion of distinct phosphoinositides ena - bles membrane flux in the exocytic and endocytic path - ways . Furthermore , we summarize the rapid progress in Box 1 | The phosphoinositide tool box The study of phosphoinositides brings with it major challenges with respect to the assessment of their nanoscale localization in cells and tissues , the quantitative or semiquantitative determination of their abundance and the selective manipulation of phosphoinositide levels . Detection of phosphoinositides The most widely used tools to monitor phosphoinositides in cells and tissues are sensors based on specific lipid - binding domains , such as the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of phospholipase c δ ( Plc δ ) for phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate or the FYve domain of HrS for phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( for a comprehensive overview , see 196 ) . Such sensors have been generated for all phosphoinositides and , with the exception of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 5 - phosphate , have been validated and broadly applied . of importance , many of these sensors may not detect all subcellular pools of their cognate lipid with equal efficiency . A prime example of this is the distinct sensors used to detect the Golgi membrane pools versus the endolysosomal and plasma membrane pools of phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 196 , 213 . The ideal sensor should ( 1 ) specifically recognize a single phosphoinositide , ( 2 ) depend on the respective phosphoinositide for its subcellular localization and ( 3 ) be recruited to cellular membranes in the absence of additional factors ( for example , proteins ) 196 . When expressed in cells fused to a fluorescent protein , such sensors offer insight with unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution . A major caveat associated with this approach is that any expressed lipid sensor will inevitably compete with endogenous proteins for binding to its target lipid and , thereby , interfere with the respective cellular processes or processes this lipid regulates . Additionally , differing expres - sion levels in between cells and the signal from unbound cytoplasmic sensor preclude quantitative measurements of the total levels of specific phosphoinositides . To bypass these limitations , some of these sensors can be produced recombi - nantly and purified for use as probes on fixed cells or tissue 7 , 196 , 213 , akin to the detection of phosphoinositides using specific antibodies 55 , 97 , 130 , 185 . An alternative to these imaging - based approaches is the biochemical determination of phosphoinositides in lipid extracts from cells or tissue to measure their abundance . This is commonly done by anion - exchange high - performance liquid chromatography - based separation of the deacylated phosphoinositide head groups . because of the low abun - dance of phosphoinositides , this approach requires prior metabolic labelling of cells with radioactive 32 P . more recently , sensitive label - free mass spectrometry - based approaches have come into focus for measuring phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate 214 and phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( ReF . 215 ) , and variations on these methods for the global label - free analysis of phosphoinositides have since been reported 216 , 217 . Manipulation of phosphoinositides The genetic manipulation of a phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzyme ( that is , via rNA interference or genomic engi - neering ) is often the first approach to perturb either the synthesis or the turnover of a specific lipid . As with all genetic approaches , potential caveats may arise from compensatory changes in the cells’ phosphoinositide metabolism . moreover , enzymes may be promiscuous with regard to the substrate or may have non - catalytic scaffolding roles that hamper the interpretation of the findings . The acute manipulation of lipid levels has therefore been an important addi - tion to the phosphoinositide tool box . Such systems rely on the small - molecule ( that is , rapamycin / rapalogue ) 218 , 219 or light - induced ( that is , optogenetic ) 220 heterodimerization of ( 1 ) a diffusely localized cytoplasmic phosphoinositide kinase or phosphatase ( or the catalytic domain thereof ) and ( 2 ) a construct providing subcellular targeting ( for example , to the plasma membrane or to endosomes ) . This approach enables the acute and reversible recruitment and ensuing manipulation of the levels of specific phosphoinositides , but is usually limited to cultured cells . Finally , cells can be provided with exogenous phosphoinositides , which , for example , can be useful to address the lipid dependence of a loss - of - function phenotype of a phosphoinositide kinase . To render the highly polar head group membrane - permeant , the phosphate groups have to be masked with acetoxymethyl esters , which once inside the cell are cleaved by endogenous esterases 221 . With use of this approach the global concentration of a specific phosphoinositide within cells can be raised . To increase the spatial resolution of this approach , coumarin - caged derivatives of membrane - permeant phosphoinositides have been generated that enable their light - induced activation via uncaging at specific subcellular sites 222 , 223 . The functionalization of the acyl chain with a diazirine group for uv crosslinking and a terminal alkyne for click chemistry has further expanded the possible applications of membrane - permeant phosphoinositides ( for example , to allow the identification of novel phosphoinositide - associated proteins 224 ) . PtdIns 3 - kinase ( Pi3K ) . a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3 ′ position of the inositol head group of phosphatidylinositol ( Ptdins ) lipids .

Finally , we outline perspectives for future research and biomedicine . For a detailed discussion of the roles of phosphoinos - itides in cancer cell signalling and in the regulation of ion channels and other membrane proteins 10 , 11 and of non - canonical phosphoinositide functions in the nucleus , the reader is referred to excellent recent reviews 9 , 12 , 13 . Exocytic and endocytic membrane dynamics Phosphoinositides were originally discovered more than half a century ago as rare phospholipid species that undergo turnover upon stimulation of hormone secretion 14 . These observations related to what is now known as the phosphoinositide cycle : agonists acti - vate phospholipase C ( PLC ) to hydrolyse PtdIns 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) into the second messengers diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) , followed by recycling of the components and resynthesis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ReF . 4 ) . Studies initiated in yeast 15 and continued over the past few decades in multiple models have established that in addition to cell signalling , phosphoinositides control virtually every step of membrane traffic along the secretory and endocytic pathways . This regulatory role of phosphoinositides is closely linked to their differential distribution between cellular subcompartments 6 ( Fig . 1c ) . From a bird’s - eye view , PtdIns 4 - phosphates signpost the secretory pathway with the Golgi complex containing high levels of PtdIns 4 - phosphate ( PtdIns4P ) and the plasma membrane being enriched in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and , to a lesser extent , PtdIns4P . By contrast , PtdIns 3 - phosphates such as PtdIns3P and PtdIns 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) dominate the endolysosomal system . To preserve orga - nellar membrane identity , traffic between compartments needs to be coupled to the interconversion of phos - phoinositide species by functional units comprising phosphoinositide phosphatases and kinases that act in concert . In the following sections , we discuss how this enables phosphoinositides to direct the flow of mem - branes along the secretory pathway , on the endocytic route and in the sorting of cargo from endosomes . Secretory membrane traffic Secretory proteins synthesized in the ER are trafficked to the Golgi complex via CoPii vesicles or tubules before being packaged into carriers destined for the plasma membrane at the trans - golgi network ( TGN ) . Protein secretion and the function of the TGN as a sorting station crucially depend on PtdIns4P . Vertebrates express four isoforms of PtdIns 4 - kinases ( PI4Ks ) , the PI3K - related type III isoforms PI4KIIIα and PI4KIIIβ , and the evo - lutionarily unrelated type II isoforms PI4KIIα and PI4KIIβ 4 . The Golgi pool of PtdIns4P is synthesized by PI4KIIα , PI4KIIβ and by PI4KIIIβ , which is recruited to the Golgi complex by the small GTPase ARF1 ( ReF . 16 ) and the giantin - interacting protein ACBD 17 . PtdIns4P - mediated control of secretory carrier forma - tion . Although none of the phosphoinositides appears to be enriched in ER membranes , COPII - coated carrier formation at ER exit sites has been linked to PtdIns4P generation by PI4KIIIα 18 .

The formation of TGN - derived car - riers directed towards the plasma membrane or to endolysosomal compartments depends on PtdIns4P , as shown by acute depletion of this lipid 19 ( Box 1 ) . Membrane recruitment of the clathrin adaptor proteins AP1 , GGA1 and GGA2 , which mediate transport from the TGN to endosomes and lysosomes , is promoted by PtdIns4P 19 , 20 . The importance of PtdIns4P for assembly of clathrin adaptors on TGN and endosomal mem - branes is further evidenced by the interaction of AP1 with PI4KIIβ 21 , GGA2 with PI4KIIIβ 22 and AP3 with PI4KIIα 23 . A comprehensive understanding of the presumably clathrin - independent formation of vesicles for con - stitutive secretion is still elusive , although PtdIns4P plays a central role . Effectors of PtdIns4P include Golgi - localized phosphoprotein 3 ( GOLPH3 ) , which associates with PtdIns4P and myosin 18A and thereby exerts a tensile force on Golgi membranes 24 . Extrusion of membrane tubules in preparation for secretory carrier formation from the TGN has also been linked to micro - tubule motor proteins 25 . The recent description of the DoPeY1 – MoN2 complex as an adaptor linking PtdIns4P - , phosphatidic acid - and ARF1 - positive membranes to kinesin 1 ( ReF . 26 ) suggests that also kinesin - dependent carrier formation relies on PtdIns4P . A complex of PI4KIIIβ , 14 - 3 - 3 protein - γ and the fission - promoting factors CTBP1 / BARS 27 and protein kinase D ( PKD ) 28 is believed to couple extrusion of vesicular carriers to membrane scission . A more complex regulatory function of PtdIns4P in secretion from the TGN is its role in linking the forma - tion of secretory carriers to maintenance of the distinct lipid composition of post - Golgi membranes , which are enriched in glycosphingolipids , sphingomyelin and cho - lesterol . PtdIns4P in TGN membranes is required for the transfer of cholesterol and ceramide lipids to the TGN from the ER ( see the section entitled Membrane contact sites ) , which in turn promote generation of PtdIns4P , as explained later : ceramide is used together with phosphatidylcholine to generate sphingomyelin , Table 2 | Phosphoinositide phosphatases in human disease Gene Enzyme Substrate Product Disease Mouse model phenotype Refs FIG4 5 - phosphatase FIG4 PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns3P Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease type 4J ; Yunis – Varon - syndrome ; amyotrophic and primary lateral sclerosis Small size , juvenile lethality ; abnormal gait and tremor ; neurodegeneration 197 INPP4B 4 - phosphatase INPP4B PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 PtdIns3P Cancer Obesity ; diabetes ; increased breast cancer susceptibility 89 , 187 INPPL1 ( also known as SHIP2 ) 5 - phosphatase SHIP2 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 Opsismodysplasia Lethargy ; elevated insulin sensitivity 198 INPP5E 5 - phosphatase INPP5E PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 PtdIns4P Joubert syndrome ; MORM syndrome Perinatal lethality ; kidney cysts ; midbrain and hindbrain malformation ; ciliogenesis defects 125 INPP5G ( also known as SYNJ1 ) 4 - phosphatase and 5 - phosphatase synaptojanin 1 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns4P PtdIns4P PtdIns Parkinson disease Neurological defects ; perinatal lethality 199 MTM1 3 - phosphatase MTM1 PtdIns3P PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns PtdIns5P X - linked centronuclear myopathy Myopathy ; reduced lifespan 117 MTMR2 3 - phosphatase MTMR2 PtdIns3P PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns PtdIns5P Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease type 4B1 Peripheral neuropathy ; focal hypermyelination 117 , 200 MTMR5 ( also known as SBF1 ) 3 - phosphatase MTMR5 PtdIns3P PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns PtdIns5P Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease type 4B3 Defective axon radial sorting 117 , 200 MTMR13 ( also known as SBF2 ) 3 - phosphatase MTMR13 PtdIns3P PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns PtdIns5P Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease type 4B2 Peripheral neuropathy ; focal hypermyelination 117 , 200 MTMR14 3 - phosphatase MTMR14 PtdIns3P PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns PtdIns5P Centronuclear myopathy Myopathy 117 OCRL 5 - phosphatase OCRL PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns4P Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe ; Dent disease No overt phenotype due to compensation by INPP5B 201 PTEN 3 - phosphatase PTEN PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 PtdIns4P Sporadic tumours ; Cowden syndrome ; Bannayan – Riley – Ruvalcaba syndrome Embryonic lethality ; hyperplasia in het mice 202 MTM1 , myotubularin 1 ; MTMR , myotubularin - related protein ; PtdIns , phosphatidylinositol ; PtdIns3P , phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ; PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , phosphatidylin - ositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ; PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , phosphatidylinositol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ; PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ; PtdIns4P , phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ; PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ; PtdIns5P , phosphatidylinositol 5 - phosphate .

PKD promotes secretory carrier formation at the TGN 28 and also stimulates PI4KIIIβ activity 30 . Increased cholesterol levels promote palmitoylation and TGN recruitment of PI4KIIα , which together with PI4KIIIβ facilitates PtdIns4P synthesis from PtdIns 31 . Hence , PtdIns4P couples secretion from the TGN to acquisition of the distinct membrane composition char - acteristic of post - Golgi membranes . The physiological relevance of this interplay was recently demonstrated by defective myelination in mice lacking PI4KIIIβ expression in schwann cells 32 , a cell type needing to sustain a large secretory load to form the cholesterol - and sphingolipid - rich myelin sheath around axons that facilitates saltatory conduction in peripheral nerves . PtdIns4P is also at the nexus of tuning secretion in response to growth factor and nutrient availability . Serum depletion causes the translocation of the PtdIns4P 4 - phosphatase SAC1 from the ER to the Golgi complex , thereby reducing the levels of PtdIns4P at the TGN and effectively limiting secretion 33 . Intriguingly , PtdIns4P may further serve as a sensor of cytoplasmic pH , whereby cytoplasmic acidification and the ensuing pro - tonation of phosphoesters in the lipid head group of PtdIns4P disrupt its interaction with PtdIns4P - binding effector proteins ; this will lead to downregulation of secretion under non - permissive metabolic conditions ( that is , glucose starvation ) , leading to inactivation of a proton pump 34 .

Constitutive exocytosis — which is necessary for the secretion of , for example , general plasma membrane proteins , col - lagen or glycosaminoglycans — requires the exocyst , an eight - subunit complex that tethers exocytic vesi - cles to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ReF . 38 ) at the plasma membrane 39 . Engagement of the complex with exocytic vesicles is regulated by the small GTPase RAB11 and PtdIns4P 40 . Of note , the exocytosis of recycling vesicles that ema - nate from PtdIns3P - rich endosomal compartments requires conversion of PtdIns3P to PtdIns4P by the 3 - phosphatase myotubularin 1 ( MTM1 ) and PI4KIIα 41 ( see the section entitled Phosphoinositides in endo - cytic recycling ) . Interestingly , PI4KIIα has also been found on neurosecretory synaptic vesicles , suggesting that conserved mechanisms regulate the final steps of vesicle exocytosis 42 . From these studies a model emerges whereby the formation and fission of secretory carriers is controlled by PtdIns4P , while the final steps of vesicle exocytosis depend on PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the key identity determinant of the plasma membrane . Endocytosis PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 together with PtdIns4P defines the strongly anionic nature of the plasma membrane 43 . Plasma mem - brane PtdIns4P is synthesized by PI4KIIIα and its asso - ciated subunits EFR3 and TTC7 ( ReF . 44 ) . This complex is further stabilized by FAM126A , a protein found mutated in patients with hypomyelination of the brain 45 ( TaBle 3 ) . PtdIns4P then serves as a substrate for the PtdIns4P 5 - kinases ( PIPKI ) 4 to form PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a lipid required for endocytic vesicle formation . In contrast to the plasma membrane , the endosomal system is dominated by 3 - phosphoinositides 46 . A com - mon theme across different endocytic routes therefore is that endocytic carrier formation is linked to conver - sion of membrane identity from plasma membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to endosomal PtdIns3P ( Fig . 1c ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is the main constitutive internal - ization route common to all cells 47 . During CME the sequential assembly of the clathrin coat concentrates cargo proteins into a clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) via simultaneous detection of both cargo and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by clathrin adaptors 48 ( Box 1 ) . The nascent CCP acquires increasing curvature and eventually buds off to form an endocytic vesicle ( Fig . 2a ) that undergoes fusion with early endosomes . During this process PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is gradually turned over , concomitant with the acquisition of 3 ′ - phosphoinositide identity that is characteristic of the endosomal system 46 . Many endocytic proteins associate with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , including the early - acting clathrin adaptor AP2 , the Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ( BAR ) domain - containing proteins Fer / Cip4 homology domain - only protein 1 ( FCHO1 ) and FCHO2 , and numerous cargo adaptors 49 . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , cargo and FCHO proteins trigger con - formational opening of AP2 to enable its binding to cargo and to clathrin 50 – 52 . Nascent CCP formation and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis are further linked via activation of PIPKI by AP2 – cargo complexes 53 . This suggests a feedforward loop of adaptors binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cargo to trigger increased local formation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 during CCP nucleation , until clathrin binding to AP2 displaces PIPKI 54 . The subsequent growth and maturation of CCPs are accompanied by the gradual depletion of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 from the coat and the concomitant synthesis of PtdIns 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) 55 . This phosphoinositide conversion mechanism involves the recruitment of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase synaptojanin 1 p170 ( ReF . 56 ) , an enzyme linked to Parkinson disease ( TaBle 2 ) , and the PtdIns 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 5 - phosphatase SHIP2 ( ReF . 57 ) ( TaBle 2 ) . Coincidentally , clathrin recruits the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - activated class II PI3K PI3KC2α 58 to synthesize PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 from PtdIns4P 55 , 59 . Depletion of either PI3KC2α or PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 stalls CCP dynamics and impairs the constriction of invaginated CCPs 55 , 59 . While PI3KC2α is essential in mice , human patients with inherited homozygous null mutations in the PIK3C2A gene display congenital syndromic fea - tures , including kidney failure and cataract , due to early senescence of cells in the associated tissues 60 ( TaBle 3 ) . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 promotes constriction of the endocytic CCP neck by recruitment and activation of the mem - brane curvature - inducing Phox homology ( Px ) domain – BAR domain - containing proteins sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) and SNX18 ( ReFs 55 , 61 , 62 ) and by stimulating actin polymerization 63 . Membrane constriction is a prerequi - site for endocytic vesicle fission via assembly of the large GTPase dynamin 64 mediated by the specific association of its pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain with the remain - ing pool of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ReFs 65 , 66 ) . Dynamin - mediated fission is paralleled by a burst of recruitment of syn - aptojanin 1 ( ReF . 67 ) and OCRL 68 , 69 , a 5 - phosphatase mutated in patients with oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe , a rare multisystem disorder characterized by congenital cataracts , glaucoma , intellectual disability , seizures , postnatal growth retardation and renal tubular dysfunction ( TaBle 2 ) . OCRL / synaptojanin 1 - mediated hydrolysis generates PtdIns4P 70 ( possibly in conjunc - tion with PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( ReF . 71 ) ) , which finally recruits the co - chaperone protein auxilin or GAK to trigger removal of the clathrin coat . The subsequent conver - sion of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to PtdIns3P by the endosomal 4 - phosphatase INPP4A 59 , 72 may facilitate fusion of the nascent endocytic vesicle with early endosomes marked by PtdIns3P . Visualizing this phosphoinositide conversion path - way in living cells has remained a challenge . The appli - cation of hybrid clathrin - binding sensors that allegedly detect PtdIns3P and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 has led to the alter - native proposal that PI3KC2α can directly synthesize PtdIns3P at late - stage endocytic vesicles ( after fission ) 73 . Such a model , however , is at odds with the observation that loss of PI3KC2α stalls endocytosis before vesicle fission and that a mutant form of PI3KC2α capable of synthesizing PtdIns3P but not PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 fails to rescue defective CME in cells lacking the endogenous enzyme 55 , 59 .

This study further demonstrated that the alleged dou - ble clathrin – PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 sensor 73 does not depend on PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 for enrichment at CCPs 74 . Hence , novel approaches are needed to monitor local phosphoinositide pools at endocytic sites in live cells . Clathrin - independent endocytosis . Several clathrin - independent endocytic mechanisms have been proposed ( see 75 for a detailed review ) . These pathways respond to context - dependent or tissue - specific demands 75 and are often linked to receptor - mediated class I PI3K activation . During fast endophilin - mediated endocyto - sis ( FEME ) 76 , activation of signalling receptors ( for example , the β 1 - adrenergic or EGF receptors ) triggers PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 synthesis by the receptor - associated class I PI3K isoforms PI3Kα and PI3Kβ 5 ( see also TaBle 3 ) . Subsequent formation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by the 5 - phosphatases SHIP1 and SHIP2 facilitates plasma membrane binding of the PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 - associated actin modulator lamellipodin 77 . Lamellipodin recruits the membrane - deforming N - BAR domain - containing pro - tein endophilin to the leading edge of cells , from where receptors are internalized into tubular endosomes . In addition to lamellipodin and endophilin , this process depends on the F - BAR domain - containing proteins FBP17 and CIP4 ( ReF . 78 ) , which prime endophilin assem - bly , actin and dynamin 76 . Akin to CME , FEME may be terminated by conversion of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 to PtdIns3P en route to endosomes via the 4 - phosphatases INPP4A and INPP4B 76 ( TaBle 2 ) . Large volumes of extracellular fluid are internalized by macropinocytosis ( see 79 for a review ; see Supplementary Box 1 for the closely related process of phagocytosis ) ( Fig . 2b ) . The initial large - scale membrane remodelling needed to engulf extracellular fluid is mediated by actin polymerization . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 produced by PIPKIα and PIPKIγ is essential for stabilizing the actin network and for activation of actin nucleation - promoting factors that stimulate the aRP2 / 3 complex 80 . The extension and clo - sure of the macropinocytic cup is then driven by class I PI3K - mediated synthesis of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which medi - ates the coordinated activation of Rho family GTPases through modulation of their guanine - nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase - activating proteins 81 , 82 . This is accompanied by depletion of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and resolution of the actin meshwork starting from the base of the cup , to which PI3Ks , the activation of PLCγ , recruitment of 5 - phosphatases and focal exocytosis contribute 79 . The sequential activities of SHIP1 / 2 and INPP4A / B following closure of the macropinosome convert PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to PtdIns3P , which may finally be cleared by the phosphoinos - itide 3 - phosphatase myotubularin - related protein 6 ( MTMR6 ) 79 , 83 . The dual PtdIns3P - and PtdIns4P - binding protein Phafin 2 couples these phosphoinositide conver - sions to rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton to enable macropinosome internalization 84 . It is likely that analo - gous lipid conversions govern other clathrin - independent endocytic routes ( for example , the CliC – geeC pathway 75 ) . A common principle of endocytic vesicle formation is thus the mechanistic coupling of membrane remodel - ling to a series of phosphoinositide conversion reactions that result in the loss of plasma membrane PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the concomitant acquisition of endosomal PtdIns3P identity . Dynamics of endosomes Following internalization , endocytic vesicles coalesce in the early endosomal compartment to enable further sort - ing . Endocytic cargo can be recycled to the plasma mem - brane , trafficked retrogradely to the TGN or be sorted into late endosomes ( also called ‘ multivesicular bodies ’ ) for lysosomal degradation ( Fig . 2c ) . The signature phos - phoinositide of the endosomal compartment is PtdIns3P , which is predominantly synthesized from PtdIns by the sole class III PI3K VPS34 , with minor contribu - tions from class II PI3Ks , likely depending on the cell type 5 , 46 . VPS34 operates in two distinct heterotetrameric complexes . The endosomal complex II comprises VPS34 , VPS15 – beclin 1 and UVRAG ( TaBle 3 ) . In VPS34 complex I UVRAG is replaced by ATG14L to regulate autophagy ( see later ) 5 , 46 . Fig . 2 | Phosphoinositide conversions during endocytosis and endosomal sorting . a | In clathrin - mediated endocytosis , nucleation and growth of endocytic clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) are promoted by phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) . Many adaptors , which connect the clathrin lattice with the membrane and concentrate cargo proteins in the nascent pit , bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Maturing CCPs acquire a number of phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes , including PI3KC2 α and the 5 - phosphatases SHIP2 and synaptojanin 1 ( p170 ) . The resulting formation of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) through its effectors sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) , SNX18 and FCHSD2 promotes constriction of the neck of invaginated CCPs . During uncoating of newly formed vesicles , a burst of recruitment of the 5 - phosphatases synaptojanin 1 ( p145 ) and OCRL depletes PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The 4 - phosphatases INPP4A , INPP4B and SAC2 complete conversion of membrane identity towards the endosomal signature lipid phos - phatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns3P ) . b | Macropinocytosis , the internalization of large amounts of extracellular fluid , is largely driven by membrane remodelling through branched F - actin formation . Initial membrane ruffling requires the formation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by PIPKI α / γ to promote actin polymerization . Receptor ( that is , insulin or growth factor receptors ) activation triggers the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) by class I phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ) to regulate Rho family guanine - nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) during expansion of the macropinocytic cup . Remodelling and resolution of the subcortical actin cytoskeleton requires depletion of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by phospholipase C ( PLC ) and 5 - phosphatases starting from the base of the cup . These phosphoinositide conversions enable recruitment of the dual PtdIns3P - and phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PtdIns4P ) - binding protein Phafin 2 , a protein also required for actin remod - elling . c | The endosomal sorting of cargo depends on PtdIns3P . Endosomal PtdIns3P is largely synthesized by VPS34 complex II , which is activated by RAB5 – GTP . Coincidence of cargo and PtdIns3P underlies the sorting of cargo into degradative and retrieval subdo - mains . This is mediated by proteins that can simultaneously bind to PtdIns3P and to spe - cific sorting signals in cargo proteins . Endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) 0 binds to ubiquitylated proteins and through self - association forms degradative subdomains . Retrieval signals are recognized by various members of the SNX family that operate in conjunction with different retrieval complexes .

NATure revieWS | MoLECuLaR CELL BioLoGy R e v i e w s volume 23 | December 2022 | 805 0123456789 ( ) ; : Establishing early endosomal membrane identity . The small GTPase RAB5 is instrumental for the maintenance and function of the early endosomal compartment 85 . Initial RAB5 activation is linked to the formation of endocytic carriers by RME6 ( also known as GAPVD1 ) , a GEF that couples clathrin – AP2 uncoat - ing to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion 86 . On early endosomes RAB5 activity is controlled by the RAB5 GEF Rabex 5 , the RAB5 – GTP - associated VPS34 complex II ( ReF . 87 ) and its lipid product PtdIns3P , and the RAB5 effector Rabaptin 5 , which forms a tight complex with Rabex 5 . The resulting feedforward loop generates and main - tains the canonical membrane environment enriched in RAB5 – GTP and PtdIns3P that characterizes early endosomes 88 . Dual key recognition of RAB5 – GTP and PtdIns3P underlies homotypic early endosome fusion , a reaction that is required to sustain endocytic traffic of internalized cargo and to maintain early endoso - mal membrane homeostasis 88 . Further RAB5 effectors include the 5 - phosphatases OCRL and INPP5B as well as the PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 4 - phosphatases INPP4A and INPP4B 72 , 89 , 90 , which ensure conversion of incoming phosphoinositides ( on the incoming endocytic vesi - cles ) to PtdIns3P . Besides membrane fusion , endosomal PtdIns3P forms the basis for cargo fate decisions . As discussed later , the arrival of internalized cargo in the PtdIns3P - enriched endosome triggers the formation of spatially separated subdomains that enable cargo sorting for retrieval or degradation 91 . Phosphoinositides in endocytic recycling . During endocytic recycling , membrane is returned from PtdIns3P - containing endosomal compartments to the PtdIns4P / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched plasma mem - brane . The bulk of the membrane is retrieved from endosomes in the form of tubulovesicular carriers via protein complexes including retromer , retriever and esCPe - 1 ( Fig . 2c ) . These retrieval complexes cluster cargo containing specific sorting motifs into retrieval sub - domains . Once a critical density is reached , the under - lying membrane is tubulated by the concerted action of BAR domain - containing SNX proteins and Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue ( WASH ) - dependent branched F - actin formation 92 , 93 . These retrieval complexes are targeted to endosomes by PtdIns3P . Retromer operates in the recycling of dis - tinct sets of cargo proteins with either SNX3 or SNX27 , both of which contain a PtdIns3P - binding PX domain 92 . In retriever and ESCPE - 1 , a similar role is fulfilled by SNX17 ( ReF . 94 ) and SNX1 / 2 , respectively 93 , 95 . Interestingly , loss of the WASH - associated endosomal COMMD / CCDC22 / CCDC93 ( CCC ) complex leads to elevated endosomal PtdIns3P levels as a consequence of defective recruitment of the 3 - phosphatase MTMR2 ( ReF . 96 ) , an enzyme mutated in Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease type 4B ( TaBle 2 ) , suggesting control of PtdIns3P levels through components of the recycling machinery . This increase in PtdIns3P levels depends on VPS34 and is accompanied by accumulation of the WASH complex and F - actin on endosomal structures 96 . Distinct pools of PtdIns3P , syn - thesized by PI3KC2α on RAB11 - positive endosomes 97 and at a specialized endosomal compartment at the base of primary cilia 98 , have also been implicated in endocytic recycling , but the mechanistic underpinnings of these observations remain unclear . The function of the WASH complex is further sub - ject to regulation by PtdIns4P on endosomes through PI4KIIα / β and ER – endosome contact sites ( see the sec - tion entitled Membrane contact sites ) 99 . This raises the intriguing possibility that endosomal retrieval itself may be linked to phosphoinositide conversion of PtdIns3P to PtdIns4P . Upon retrieval from endosomes , cargo can be trafficked to either of two PtdIns4P - rich desti - nations , the TGN or the plasma membrane 92 . Indeed , the subsequent exocytosis of recycling vesicles requires a phosphoinositide conversion module comprising the PtdIns3P phosphatase MTM1 , PI4KIIα and the exocyst complex 41 . In the absence of MTM1 , recycling vesicles fail to fuse with the plasma membrane , a phenotype that is recapitulated upon perturbation of PI4KIIα , RAB11 or exocyst and which likely contributes to the pathology of x - linked centronuclear myopathy in patients with loss of function of MTM1 ( ReF . 41 ) ( TaBle 2 ) . Hence , recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane is intrinsi - cally coupled to conversion of membrane identity from PtdIns3P to PtdIns4P ( Fig . 2c ) . Phosphoinositides in degradative sorting and endosomal maturation . Ubiquitylated cargo destined for lysosomal delivery is sorted into vesicles that bud into the lumen of maturing endosomes . This formation of intralume - nal vesicles is catalysed by four subcomplexes called ‘endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRT ) 0 – III’ ( ReF . 100 ) . ESCRT - 0 is a heterotetramer of two copies each of HRS and STAM and is constitutively targeted to the early endosomal compartment through the PtdIns3P - binding FYVe domain of HRS 101 ( TaBle 1 ) . As both HRS and STAM contain multiple ubiquitin - binding sites and can self - associate into larger complexes , the coincidence of ubiquitylated cargo and PtdIns3P leads to the formation of degradative subdomains on endosomes 92 . The sequential activity of ESCRT - I to ESCRT - III mediates the inward budding of the endo - somal membrane and eventually the inclusion of deg - radative subdomains in intralumenal vesicles 100 ( Fig . 2c ) . Increasing formation of intralumenal vesicles results in endosomal maturation to late endosomes / multive - sicular bodies and is accompanied by endosomal con - version of RAB5 to RAB7 . This depends on the RAB7 GEF MON1 – CCZ1 binding to RAB5 – GTP to displace Rabex 5 and thereby disrupt the self - perpetuating loop of RAB5 activation 102 , 103 . Effectors of RAB7 – GTP character - ize the late endosomal compartment and include VPS34 complex II and the retromer complex , ensuring contin - ued PtdIns3P formation and retrieval of cargo 103 . Late endosomal PtdIns3P serves as a substrate for the PiKfyve complex , a PtdIns3P 5 - kinase that is essential for late endosomal and lysosomal function and homeostasis 104 , 105 ( see also TaBle 3 ) , as discussed in the following section . In conclusion , endosomal recycling to the cell sur - face versus degradative sorting to late endosomes and lysosomes is governed by loss versus consolidation of endosomal PtdIns3P identity , likely involving distinct endosomal lipid nanodomains .

Lysosomes and lysosome - related organelles ( for example , lytic granules in immune cells and melanosomes ) also fulfil multiple other functions , including roles in secre - tion ( for example , of hydrolases and cytotoxins ) and as a metabolic signalling hub that integrates nutrient sens - ing and metabolic adaptation with lipid and metabolite exchange between organelles , for example via MCSs ( see later ) . It is thus not surprising that lysosomes har - bour a diverse complement of phosphoinositides 46 , 107 that may be adapted to the functional state of the cell ( Fig . 3 ) . Extracellular material is delivered to the lysosome lumen by the endocytic pathway via fusion with late endosomes as discussed earlier herein .

VPS34complex II Fig . 3 | Phosphoinositide control of lysosome function . Lysosomes har - bour a diverse complement of phosphoinositides that regulate their func - tions . In fed cells ( left ) , lysosomal phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( PtdIns3P ) and phosphatidylinositol 3 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) syn - thesized by VPS34 and PIKfyve , respectively , facilitate nutrient signalling via mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) , possibly by asso - ciating with its regulatory associated protein of mTOR ( Raptor ) subunit ( number 1 ) . mTORC1 activity is facilitated by oxysterol - binding protein ( OSBP ) - mediated cholesterol transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) at membrane contact sites ( MCSs ) . PtdIns3P also promotes the anterograde transport of lysosomes via kinesin recruitment by FYVE and coiled - coil domain - containing protein 1 ( FYCO1 ) and its binding partner RAB7 ( num - ber 2 ) . Under starvation ( right ) , mTORC1 activity is repressed by local phos - phatidylinositol 3 , 4 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ) synthesis mediated by class II phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase - β ( PI3KC2 β ) . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 facilitates reverse cholesterol transfer from lysosomes to the ER via OSBP - related protein 1 long isoform ( ORP1L ) at MCSs ( number 3 ) . Concomitantly , starvation induces autophagy . Delivery of vesicles containing PI4KIII β and ATG9A may aid phagophore membrane extrusion ( number 4 ) . Formation of PtdIns3P by VPS34 complex I is required to drive expansion of the phagophore membrane from the ER by recruiting multiple effector proteins , leading to LC3 lipidation by the ATG16L complex ( ATG12 – ATG5 – ATG16L ) and autophagosome formation ( number 5 ) . Membrane fusion between PtdIns3P - containing autophagosomes and lysosomes involves complex pathways of PtdIns3P – PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PtdIns4P ) – phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) synthesis and turn over that involve phosphatidylinositol 4 - kinase II α ( PI4KII α ) and the RAB7 effector protein PLEKHM1 ( number 6 ) . Starvation - triggered Ca 2 + efflux via the PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - activated Ca 2 + - channel mucolipin 1 activates calcineurin and , thereby , induces transcription of autophagy / lysosomal genes via nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) ( number 7 ) . Prolonged starvation triggers autophagic lysosome reformation ( ALR ) , a process that involves multiple lysosomal phosphoinositides . Synthesis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on lysosomes by PtdIns4P 5 - kinase ( PIPKI ) isoforms induces the formation of lysosomal tubules and the assembly of clathrin – AP2 coats that support the budding of protolysosomes from tubular intermediates via dynamin 2 . Tubulation is further facilitated by VPS34 complex II - mediated synthesis of PtdIns3P , which serves to recruit the FYVE domain - containing protein spastizin , and by PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis via PIKfyve ( number 8 ) .

Autophagy is unique in enabling the topological inversion of the cytoplasm and the creation of de novo membrane iden - tity by synthesis of PtdIns3P from PtdIns on specialized sites of the ER . Phosphoinositides in autophagy Phosphoinositide regulation of autophagosome forma - tion . The biogenesis of autophagosomes is orchestrated by multiple complexes containing autophagy - related proteins ( ATG proteins ) that first initiate the forma - tion of a preautophagosomal structure , termed the ‘phagophore’ , that emanates from specialized PtdIns3P - enriched sites 109 , 110 on the ER referred to as the ‘omega - some’ 109 . The phagophore elongates and closes to form a mature autophagosome that will ultimately fuse with the lysosome . Autophagy is initiated by activation of the UNC - 51 - like kinase 1 ( ULK1 ) complex — for example down - stream of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) inactivation ( Fig . 3 , number 3 ) . Translocation of the ULK1 complex to phagophore initiation sites at the ER may be aided by delivery of PI4KIIIβ via ves - icles marked by the transmembrane protein ATG9A to produce a local pool of PtdIns4P ( ReF . 111 ) . Active ULK1 promotes the recruitment of VPS34 complex I ( ReF . 112 ) , which is responsible for the local production of PtdIns3P ( Fig . 3 , number 4 ) . Autophagic pools of PtdIns3P may also be synthesized by class II PI3Ks , including PI3KC2α , under specific cell physiologi - cal conditions ( for example , shear stress 113 ) . PtdIns3P acts as a signalling molecule for the recruitment of various PtdIns3P - binding proteins , such as dou - ble FYVE domain - containing protein 1 ( DFCP1 ) , autophagy - linked FYVE protein ( ALFY ) and the WD repeat domain phosphoinositide - interacting protein ( WIPI ) family of scaffold proteins 110 . WIPI2 via its PRoPPiN domain binds to PtdIns3P at the omegasome and recruits the ATG12 – ATG5 – ATG16L1 complex 114 , which acts as an E3 - like ligase for the conjugation of ubiquitin - like lC3 family proteins to phosphatidylethanol - amine . In this mechanism , WIPI2 and VPS34 complex I mutually promote each other’s recruitment , resulting in a positive feedback loop between PtdIns3P and LC3 lipidation 115 , which is essential for expansion and clo - sure of the phagophore ( Fig . 3 , number 5 ) . Furthermore , at PtdIns3P - abundant sites , WIPI4 via association with the lipid transfer protein ATG2 ( ReF . 116 ) tethers the ER to the expanding phagophore , allowing phospholipid transfer required for phagophore expansion ( Fig . 4a , number 5 ) . While generation of PtdIns3P is necessary for the initiation of autophagy , its clearance is a prerequi - site for the completion of the pathway by lysosomal degradation 108 , 110 . PtdIns3P hydrolysis during later stages of autophagy is mediated by members of the myotubularin family of 3 - phosphatases ( MTMR pro - teins ) . Depletion of these phosphatases causes cell type - specific and / or tissue type - specific defects in auto - phagy , and their dysfunction has been linked to human diseases , including X - linked centronuclear myopathy and Charcot – Marie – Tooth disease 117 ( TaBle 2 ) . Phosphoinositide regulation of autophagosome – lysosome fusion . Multiple phosphoinositides control the tethering and fusion of lysosomes with autopha - gosomes via incompletely understood mechanisms 118 ( Fig . 3 , number 6 ) . Autophagosomes are enriched in VPS34 complex I - derived PtdIns3P 119 , while lysosomes contain PtdIns3P synthesized by VPS34 complex II and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesized by the PIKfyve complex ( comprising PIKfyve , VAC14 and FIG4 ) . Lysosomal PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 is eventually hydrolysed by MTMR family members and by INPP5E 104 , 105 , a 5 - phosphatase that can act on PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( ReF . 120 ) . PIKfyve - mediated synthe - sis and turnover of lysosomal PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 are thus both key events in autophagosome – lysosome fusion . Potential effector proteins of lysosomal PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 include the actin - associated protein cortactin 121 , the lyso - somal calcium release channel mucolipin 122 , twin pore channel 2 ( TPC2 ) 123 and the PX domain - containing pro - tein SNX14 ( ReF . 124 ) . Given that INPP5E is mutated in Joubert syndrome in humans 125 ( TaBle 2 ) and that truncat - ing mutations of SNX14 cause familial cerebellar atrophy , these phosphoinositide dynamics have important pathophysiological implications . In addition to autophagosomal PtdIns3P and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 on lysosomes , autophagosome – lysosome fusion requires synthesis of PtdIns4P by a lysosomal pool of PI4KIIα 126 . On lysosomes , PtdIns4P can be fur - ther phosphorylated to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which triggers the dissociation of the RAB7 effector PLEKHM1 by an unknown mechanism 126 . As lysosomal PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 inhibits the lysosomal calcium release channel mucol - ipin 1 — a protein required for sustained autophagy by regulating transcriptional activity of transcription factor EB ( TFEB ) , which regulates the transcription of many lysosomal and autophagy genes 127 ( Fig . 3 , number 7 ) — it likely needs to be restricted to nanodomains that may be generated by OCRL 5 - phosphatase - mediated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis 128 . Finally , recent data from mice and worms suggest that non - conventional synthesis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 via phosphorylation of PtdIns 5 - phosphate ( PtdIns5P ) by PtdIns5P 4 - kinases ( TaBle 3 ) facilitates lipid catabolism by clearance of autophagosomes during fasting 129 . The function of this PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 pool remains to be elucidated . From these data , a model emerges whereby parallel pathways of PtdIns3P – PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns4P – PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis and turnover control distinct , yet poorly characterized , steps in the formation of autolysosomes . Lysosome dynamics and activity Lysosomes harbour a diverse complement of phos - phoinositides ( Fig . 3 ) that may reflect their distinct roles depending on the functional or metabolic state of the cell . In addition to PtdIns3P , which controls auto - phagosome formation and dominates the endosomal system 46 , lysosomes have been shown to contain or be regulated by PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 and possibly PtdIns5P .

As described earlier herein , lysosomes also harbour minor pools of PtdIns4P and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , phosphoinositides most highly enriched at the Golgi complex and at the plasma membrane , respectively , 4 , 6 , 49 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , a rare phosphoinositide species that may control lysosome function in response to cessation of insulin growth factor signalling 5 , 130 . These different phos - phoinositide pools likely correlate with the functional state and / or mark distinct subsets of lysosomes 106 ( for example , PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 - containing degradative lysosomes harbouring a highly active vacuolar aTPase 131 ) . Phosphoinositides couple lysosome dynamics and nutrient signalling . Lysosomes serve an essential role as metabolic signalling hubs 106 . Insulin and related growth factor signalling and the availability of nutrients ( for example , amino acids ) are integrated by mTORC1 to balance catabolic pathways with anabolic pathways ( that is , autophagy with the synthesis of proteins , lipids and nucleotides ) . mTORC1 is a multiprotein assembly that is composed of the kinase mTOR , a distant relative of the PI3Ks , and regulatory - associated protein of mTOR ( Raptor ) , as well as additional subunits . It is recruited to lysosomes by Rag small gTPases in response to cellular and lysosomal amino acid status 106 . Among the major direct substrates of active mTORC1 are translation - promoting ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 , the autophagy regulatory kinase ULK1 and TFEB . mTORC1 - mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 and TFEB represses auto - phagy and autophagy / lysosomal gene expression 127 , while promoting protein synthesis under conditions of ample growth factor and nutrient supply 106 .

Sustained activation of AKT at the cell surface can be achieved by hydrolysis of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 via the inositol 5 - phosphatase SHIP2 ( ReF . 5 ) .

Phosphoinositides regulate the formation of membrane contact sites ( MCSs ) ( panel a ) , while MCSs mediate lipid transfer and control phosphoinositide metabolism ( panel b ) . a | During MCS formation , phosphoinositides in the membrane of one organelle recruit a specific phosphoinositide - binding protein anchored in the membrane of another organelle .

Lipid transfer can follow the concentration gradient or can be powered by the countertransport of another lipid . Examples of this lipid transfer include countertransport of cholesterol and phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PtdIns4P ) by OSBP at MCSs between the ER and the TGN ( number 1 ) ; phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ) and PtdIns4P by ORP10 at ER – endosome con - tacts ( number 2 ) ; and PtdSer and PtdIns4P / phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) by OSBP - related protein 5 ( ORP5 ) / ORP8 at ER – plasma membrane MCSs ( number 3 ) .

Recent data indicate that mTORC1 activity and lys - osome dynamics are further regulated locally by lysoso - mal phosphoinositides , for example PtdIns3P , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 132 . The PtdIns3P - generating kinase VPS34 appears to be required for full activation of mTORC1 ( for example , during refeeding after starvation 133 , 134 ) . While the exact mechanism by which PtdIns3P acti - vates mTORC1 is unclear , it has been postulated that PtdIns3P - mediated induction of mTORC1 activity requires the formation of MCSs between lysosomes and the ER ( see the next section ) and the concomitant translo - cation of lysosomal mTORC1 to the cell periphery , where insulin and growth factor signalling occur 135 . This mecha - nism involves the association of the ER membrane protein protrudin with lysosomal PtdIns3P and the recruitment of the PtdIns3P - binding protein FYVE and coiled - coiled domain - containing protein 1 ( FYCO1 ) to lysosomes to facilitate kinesin - driven anterograde transport of lysosomes 136 ( Fig . 3 , number 2 ) . Loss of either protrudin or FYCO1 represses mTORC1 activity , while increasing the levels of active TFEB in the nucleus 135 , highlighting the close ties of phosphoinositides , mTORC1 , and lysosome homeostasis and dynamics . A second mechanism by which PtdIns3P can regulate lysosome function and dynamics involves the generation of PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 from PtdIns3P via PIKfyve . Neuronal depletion of PIKfyve or sustained pharmacological inhi - bition of PIKfyve stalls lysosome movement in neurites , likely contributing to the neurodegeneration observed in PIKfyve gene - knockout models 137 ( TaBle 3 ) . In some cell types , including Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system , and in yeast , PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 akin to PtdIns3P promotes mTORC1 activation 138 , 139 , possi - bly via binding of the mTORC1 subunit Raptor ( Fig . 3 , number 1 ) . Interestingly , PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 has also been suggested to promote the membrane recruitment of the mTORC1 - inhibitory TSC 140 . How these apparently con - flicting roles of PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 in mTORC1 regulation in different cell types can be reconciled with each other will have to await further studies . While PtdIns3P production by the class III PI3K VPS34 upregulates mTORC1 and induces lysosome dispersion , local generation of a lysosomal pool of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 by the class II PI3K PI3KC2β plays an opposing role 130 . In growth factor - deprived conditions , PI3KC2β , an enzyme mutated in focal epilepsy in humans 141 ( TaBle 3 ) , is recruited to the mTORC1 subunit Raptor on lysosomes and phosphorylates PtdIns4P to generate PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( Fig . 3 , number 3 ) . Local PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 synthesis represses mTORC1 signalling via recruitment of inhibitory 14 - 3 - 3 proteins 130 and by facilitating the oxysterol - binding protein ( OSBP ) - related protein 1 long isoform ( ORP1L ) - mediated transport of cholesterol 142 , an impor - tant cofactor for mTORC1 activation 143 , to the ER ( Fig . 3 , number 3 ) . Concomitantly , lysosomal PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 also promotes the net retrograde transport of lysosomes towards the microtubule - organizing centre ( away from the plasma membrane ) . PI3KC2β - mediated repression of mTORC1 signalling is relieved upon refeeding of cells by protein kinase N - mediated phosphorylation and com - plex formation of PI3KC2β with inhibitory 14 - 3 - 3 pro - teins in the cytoplasm 144 . Apart from 14 - 3 - 3 and ORP1L , the specific effector proteins of lysosomal PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 remain largely unknown . It is possible that PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 affects the activation cycle of small GTPases that link lysosomes to dynein or kinesin motors and , thereby , reg - ulate lysosome positioning and mTORC1 activity 106 , 107 . These include ADP - ribosylation factor - like 8 ( ARL8 ) , which promotes kinesin association with lysosomes 145 , 146 , and RAB7 , which connects lysosomes to dynein or kinesin motors 147 – 149 How exactly lysosome position - ing and mTORC1 activity are related mechanistically remains largely enigmatic . Taken together , these examples illustrate how local phosphoinositide signalling couples nutrient signalling and metabolism to lysosome dynamics . The example of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 also illustrates how a single lipid can have distinct opposing effects on a signalling pathway depending on whether it is present at the plasma mem - brane ( that is , mTORC1 activation ) or on lysosomes ( that is , mTORC1 repression ) . Phosphoinositides in lysosome reformation . During pro - longed starvation lysosomes and autolysosomes tubu - late and bud off nascent protolysosomes ( that is , small and immature lysosomes that serve to replenish the pool of functional lysosomes 150 ) . This pathway , termed ‘autophagic lysosome reformation’ ( Fig . 3 , number 8 ) , is controlled by multiple lysosomal phosphoinositide spe - cies , including PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns3P , which act at distinct stages of autophagic lysosome reformation . Prolonged starvation triggers synthesis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on autolysosomes by PIPKI isoforms 151 . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 induces lysosomal tubule formation via recruitment of kinesin 1 and the assembly of clathrin – AP2 coats , which support the budding of protolysosomes from tubular intermediates 152 . Starvation - induced lyso - some tubulation is further facilitated by PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis 153 . Protolysosomal vesicles then pinch off from clathrin – AP2 - coated tubules via the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - regulated membrane fissioning enzyme dynamin 2 ( ReF . 154 ) and VPS34 complex II - mediated synthesis of PtdIns3P 155 . Among the effectors of PtdIns3P in late steps of autophagic lysosome reformation is the FYVE domain - containing protein spastizin ( also known as ZFYVE26 or FYVE - CENT ) , a protein mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia in humans that facilitates the formation of lysosomal tubules 156 . In starved cells , spastizin together with its binding partners , the AP5 adaptor complex and SPG11 , is recruited to membranes via coincident detection of PtdIns3P and inactive RAG GTPases 157 , suggesting crosstalk between autophagic lysosome reformation and mTORC1 signalling . Membrane contact sites In addition to the budding and fusion of vesicular and tubular carriers , organelles communicate with each other via MCSs — for example by exchanging lipids and ions , by channelling of small metabolites or by facilitat - ing membrane fusion and fission processes 2 , 3 .

Given the key role of phosphoinositides as determinants of organellar membrane identity , it is not surprising that these molecules also play important roles in the function of MCSs and in regulating their dynamics . Conversely , MCSs control the differential distribution and metab olism of phosphoinositides and of other lipids ( for example , cholesterol , phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ) or phosphatidic acid ( PtdOH ) ) , often in response to cell signalling or metabolic cues 2 , 3 ( Fig . 4 ) . A particularly prominent role is played by the ER , which forms MCSs with essentially all other organelles , often involving dual key adaptors that recognize organelle - specific phosphoinositides and bind to ER - localized membrane proteins . Phosphoinositides control MCS formation A key organizing principle of intracellular membranes is that phosphoinositides in the membrane of one orga - nelle recruit a specific phosphoinositide - binding protein anchored in the membrane of another organelle , leading to the formation of MCSs ( Fig . 4a ) . A prime example is MCSs between the ER and the plasma membrane via extended synaptotagmins ( E - Syts ) and related tethers . E - Syts are ER membrane proteins that interact with the plasma membrane via their Ca 2 + - and lipid - binding C2 domains by specific recognition of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in trans ( Fig . 4a , number 1 ) . This binding occurs at resting Ca 2 + concentrations and is facilitated by elevated Ca 2 + levels , which trigger store - operated Ca 2 + entry via associ - ation of the ER protein STIM1 with the plasma mem - brane Ca 2 + channel ORAI 158 . STIM1 – ORAI and E - Syts are part of a Ca 2 + - regulated signalling shunt 159 . In this shunt PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 facilitates E - Syt - mediated MCS for - mation , while simultaneously being hydrolysed by PLC to DAG and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 then activates Ca 2 + - conducting Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 receptors in the ER . E - Syts can transfer DAG from the plasma membrane to the ER 160 , where it may serve as a precursor for subsequent resyn - thesis of PtdIns . As E - Syts are dispensable for the forma - tion and maintenance of ER – plasma membrane contacts 2 , it is likely that their function is compensated by other tethering factors , including the ER membrane - localized , PH - like GRAM domain protein GRAMD2A , TMEM24 ( also known as C2CD2L ) , an ER protein that is concen - trated at ER – plasma membrane MCSs via association with acidic plasma membrane lipids and that transfers PtdIns to the plasma membrane in stimulated pancreatic β - cells 161 , and / or ORP5 and ORP8 , lipid transfer proteins that associate with plasma membrane PtdIns4P 162 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ReF . 163 ) . Similar phosphoinositide - dependent mechanisms govern the formation of MCSs between the ER and the TGN and late endosomes or lysosomes , respectively 2 , 3 . At MCSs between the ER and the TGN , OSBP and related lipid transfer proteins ( for example , ceramide transfer protein ( CERT ) 164 ) , coincidentally associate via their PH domains with PtdIns4P on the TGN and ER - localized VAMP - associated protein ( VAP ) 2 ( Fig . 4a , number 2 ) . MCSs between the ER and late endosomes or lyso - somes likely involve multiple phosphoinositide - binding proteins . One example is the recognition of lysosomal PtdIns3P by the FYVE domain - containing ER mem - brane protein protrudin and its associated factor PDZ domain - containing protein 8 ( ReF . 165 ) . Protrudin enables the transfer of kinesin 1 from the ER to lysosomes to facilitate lysosome dispersion 136 and nutrient signalling . Moreover , OSBP 166 and ORP1L associate with VAPs in the ER and with lysosomal phosphoinositides 142 to regulate cholesterol homeostasis ( see later ) ( Fig . 4a , numbers 3 , 4 ) . As mentioned earlier , during autophagy PtdIns3P serves to tether early autophagic membranes to the ER via association with the PROPPIN domain of WIPI4 , which in turn binds to the lipid transfer protein ATG2 to facilitate lipid transfer required for phagophore expansion 116 ( Fig . 4a , number 5 ) . Lipid transfer at MCSs A major function of MCSs is to enable lipid flux between compartments mediated by lipid transfer proteins 2 . Vectorial transfer of lipids at MCSs can either follow their natural concentration gradient established by compartmen - talized synthesis or be powered by the countertransport or consumption of another lipid ( Fig . 4b ) . PtdIns4P is synthesized mainly at the Golgi complex and the plasma membrane via specific PI4Ks , while its hydrolysis is largely mediated by the ER - localized 4 - phosphatase SAC1 ( ReF . 4 ) . The resulting PtdIns4P gra - dient between the Golgi complex and the ER is utilized to power the export of lipids such as cholesterol from the ER , the main site of lipid synthesis , to the TGN and further to the cell surface . In this mechanism , OSBP connects the ER to PtdIns4P in the TGN through its FFaT motif and PH domain to enable the transfer of cholesterol between the apposed membranes via its OSBP - related domain . Concurrently , PtdIns4P is trans - ported from the TGN to the ER , where it is hydrolysed to PtdIns by SAC1 ( ReF . 167 ) ( Fig . 4b , number 1 ) . OSBP thus resembles a ferry bridge for the countertransport of lipids . The related CERT 164 and PtdIns4P adaptor protein 2 ( FAPP2 ) 168 facilitate the vectorial transfer of ceramide ( from the ER ) and glucosylceramide ( from the cis - Golgi network ) to the TGN . CERT gain of func - tion and the expected increase in ceramide transport is thought to underlie a specific form of severe intellectual disability 169 . Similar PtdIns4P - based mechanisms also operate at other ER - based MCSs 3 . These include VAP – OSBP - based MCSs between the ER and lysosomes that fuel cholesterol transport to the limiting membrane of the lysosome to facilitate nutrient signalling 166 and ER – endosome MCSs to control retromer – WASH - mediated retrograde mem - brane traffic from endosomes to the TGN 99 . Endosomal PtdIns4P also drives the countertransport of PtdSer from the ER to endosomes via the OSBP - related ORP10 ( Fig . 4b , number 2 ) , thereby promoting endosome fission by the dynamin - related ATPase EHD1 ( ReF . 170 ) . Moreover , the OSBP - related proteins ORP5 and ORP8 bind to PtdIns4P 162 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ReF . 163 ) in the plasma mem - brane to countertransport PtdSer to the cell surface ( Fig . 4b , number 3 ) . Finally , PtdIns4P 171 and its downstream products PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ReF . 142 ) have been postulated to enable the reverse flux of internalized C2 domains a membrane - binding domain homologous to the C2 domain of protein kinase C with mostly only moderate lipid specificity . some C2 domains associate with membranes in a Ca 2 + - dependent manner .

Recent data indicate that the vectorial transfer of lipids at MCSs is subject to regulation by cell signalling and metabolism . In yeast , starvation - induced cytosol acidification alters the protonation state of the head group of PtdIns4P , thereby impairing Osh1 / OSBP - mediated sterol transfer and protein sorting at the TGN 34 . In mammalian cells , Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - triggered calcium efflux from ER stores downstream of receptor signalling causes OSBP to dissociate from the TGN , resulting in the depletion of cholesterol and associated glycolipids from the cell surface 173 , while promoting the formation of E - Syt - based MCSs between the ER and the plasma membrane 158 . Hence , distinct MCSs may be subject to antagonistically controlled mechanisms of regulation . Such regulatory control of lipid flux across MCSs is critical for the integration of phosphoinositide metabo - lism with cell signalling . In response to the activation of PLC - coupled receptors , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is hydrolysed to DAG and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , resulting in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 deple - tion from the plasma membrane . To maintain phos - phoinositide signalling competence during sustained agonist - induced PLC activation , the lipid transfer protein Nir2 is recruited to MCSs between the ER and the plasma membrane . At these VAP - based MCSs , Nir2 catalyses the transport of PtdIns from the ER , its site of synthesis , to the plasma membrane , while transferring PtdOH to the ER . PtdIns – PtdOH exchange between the ER and the cell surface then fuels the resynthesis of PtdIns4P from PtdIns to enable replenishment of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , thereby ensur - ing sustained responsiveness to agonist stimulation 174 . Nir2 also facilitates the replenishment of the Golgi PtdIns pool to enable continued synthesis of PtdIns4P required to maintain the PtdIns4P – cholesterol cycle between these organelles 175 ( Fig . 4b , number 4 ) . This pathway is high - jacked by replicating hepatitis C virus to sustain viral replication during chronic infection by inducing the for - mation of OSBP – VAP - based as well as Nir2 – VAP - based MCSs between hepatitis C virus - derived replication organelles and the host ER membrane 176 ( Supplementary Box 1 ) . In pancreatic β - cells , glucose stimulation causes loss of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as a result of glucose - stimulated PLC activation . To replenish PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , its precur - sor PtdIns is transported from the ER to the plasma membrane by the lipid ER - anchored transport protein TMEM24 at MCSs ( Fig . 4b , number 5 ) . The activity of TMEM24 is controlled by Ca 2 + - regulated kinases and phosphatases that couple TMEM24 - mediated PtdIns transfer to pulsatile insulin secretion 161 . Finally , so far elusive MCSs enable ORP2 - mediated cholesterol transfer from late endosomes to integrin - and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) - containing recycling endo - somes . Cholesterol transfer promotes recycling end - osomal synthesis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , FAK activation and , thereby , cell adhesion 177 . Conclusions and perspectives Phosphoinositides are involved in nearly all aspects of membrane function and dynamics . The development of new technologies to monitor and manipulate phos - phoinositides ( Box 1 ) has yielded insights into their nanoscale localization , turnover and dynamics as well as their reciprocal regulation by cell signalling . Hitherto unknown roles of phosphoinositides in the reorganiza - tion of organellar contacts , including the discovery of contacts between three organelles 2 , have emerged . For example , the fission of mitochondria 178 or endosomes 179 has been shown to be controlled by contacts of these organelles with PtdIns4P - containing vesicles and the ER . We continue to discover new functions of phosphoinositide - metabolizing enzymes in human dis - eases ranging from cancer and metabolic disorders to rare inherited diseases caused by loss or gain of function of phosphoinositide kinases ( TaBle 3 ) and phosphatases ( TaBle 2 ) as well as their effector proteins and regula - tors ( for example , lipid transfer proteins ) . Emerging concepts of the mechanisms that spatiotemporally con - trol phosphoinositide conversion on the nanoscale not only provide us with a glimpse on the inner workings of the cell but also enable the development of novel treat - ment options for diseases linked to defective phospho - inositide metabolism . For example , pharmacological inhibition of PI3Ks such as PI3KC2β 180 may serve as a therapy for patients with X - linked centronuclear myo - pathy ( TaBle 2 ) caused by dysfunction of the PtdIns 3 - phosphatase MTM1 ( ReF . 41 ) . The prominent role of PtdIns kinases and phosphatases in bacterial infection 181 and in the replication of viruses , including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( ReF . 182 ) , suggests that specific inhibitors of these enzymes ( for exam - ple , the PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod 183 ) could serve as novel antibiotics or antiviral drugs to combat the rise of infectious diseases ( Supplementary Box 1 ) . In spite of this progress , major questions related to the function of phosphoinositides in membrane dynam - ics remain unsolved . Our quantitative understanding of phosphoinositide biology especially with respect to transient and precarious lipid species ( for exam - ple , PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) remains limited , largely owing to the lack of tools ( Box 1 ) to determine the absolute concentrations of lipids in living cells and with subcellular resolution . How phosphoinositides are regulated by metabolism and , conversely , impinge on metabolic regulation and the intracellular flux of metab - olites at the levels of cells , tissues or entire organisms remains largely enigmatic . Such information seems crucial as membrane traffic and contacts between organelles need to be adapted to cellular nutrient sta - tus ( for example , to regulate metabolic flux of lipids or fatty acids ) . Conversely , many phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases and their effectors are known to change their subcellular localization and / or activity in response to external and internal metabolic cues , identifying them as prime candidates for the metabolic rewiring of cell membranes and organelles 130 , 134 , 155 , 184 – 187 . New analytical tools to visualize phosphoinositide lipids in vivo and the development of CRISPR tech - nology to tag endogenous lipid - modifying enzymes and phosphoinositide - binding effector proteins paired with correlative live microscopy approaches will help to resolve these issues .
