However , the neural underpinnings of individual differences in IPS are still unclear . The purpose of this research was to investigate inherent full - brain connectivity patterns at voxel - level in IPS . Sixty - two healthy participants were enrolled in the study . We used a voxelwise full - brain network measurement , degree centrality ( DC ) , to depict the characteristics of cerebral network involved in individual differences in IPS . For each participant , we employed a chunk decomposition paradigm , using Mandarin characters as stimuli , to estimate the individual differences in IPS . Results showed that DC in the inferior frontal gyrus , and the middle frontal gyrus / precentral gyrus positively correlated with IPS , while the anterior cingulate cortex , and the brainstern / cerebellum / thalamus exhibited negative correlations with IPS . Using each cluster above as a seed , we performed seed - based functional connectivity analysis further . Results showed that IPS was mainly involved in the default mode network , containing the key regions of precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex . All in all , this research may shed new lights on understanding the neural underpinnings of individual differences in IPS . Keywords : insightful problem solving , brain connectivity , resting - state fMRI , individual differences , neural mechanism INTRODUCTION Insightful problem solving ( IPS ) often denotes a new and sudden comprehension of the proper solution to a speciﬁc problem with positive feelings ( i . e . , Aha ! experience ) . It has been suggested that IPS is associated with brain functions of set - shifting , mental restructuring , forming new associations , and emotion processing ( Tik et al . , 2018 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2022 ) . However , the neural substrates of individual diﬀerence in solving insightful problems remain elusive . As we know , brain underpinnings may precede behaviorally measurable cognitive processes . Uncovering sensitive brain areas might be advantageous for tracking the characteristics and cognitive processes of IPS . Furthermore , decoding the neural correlates of individual diﬀerence in IPS can elucidate why some individuals are inclined to have more insightful problem - solving success than others .

Brain Connectivity and Insight New brain imaging techniques , such as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , enable researchers to investigate neural substrates beneath the mental processes and individual diﬀerences in creative thinking . For instance , based on task - related fMRI , previous studies found that divergent thinking could involve the lateral prefrontal cortex , including ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , which is considered as the neural mechanism of cognitive control ( Benedek et al . , 2018 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ) . The anterior and posterior cingulate cortex have frequently been discovered in divergent thinking studies ( Adnan et al . , 2019 ; Wu et al . , 2020 ) . Meanwhile , lateral and medial prefrontal cortex were also regarded as key brain regions in IPS , which could involve the processes of breaking mental sets , restructuring representations , and cognitive inhibition ( Huang et al . , 2015 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) . Besides , hippocampal gyrus and amygdala were closely linked with IPS , since IPS recruited processes of forming novel associations and emotion encoding ( Huang et al . , 2015 ; Yu et al . , 2019 ) . We speculated that the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex might be the hub regions responsible for creative problem solving . Our brain produces neural signals spontaneously and constantly even when no explicit tasks are performed ( Biswal et al . , 1995 ; Kong et al . , 2015 ) . These neural signals can help us uncover the relationship between resting - state brain activities , numerous cognitive processes , and psychological individual diﬀerences . Recently , resting - state ( task - free ) fMRI studies showed accumulated evidences about the neural correlates of creative thinking ( Takeuchi et al . , 2012 ; Wei et al . , 2014 ; Wang et al . , 2022 ) . For example , studies regarding the relationship between individual diﬀerence of divergent thinking and brain spontaneous activities found that medial prefrontal and cingulate cortex play an important role in divergent thinking ( Takeuchi et al . , 2012 ) . Similarly , another resting - state study focusing on creativity also revealed that medial prefrontal cortex was closely related to individual diﬀerences in creativity ( Wei et al . , 2014 ) . These studies suggest strong linkage between spontaneous neural activity and creativity . However , as a typical creativity , insight’s relationship with the spontaneous neural activity has rarely been explored at the level of individual diﬀerence . Resting - state fMRI researches have claimed brain mechanisms underlying creativity could be reﬂected from the perspective of functional brain network , and are not merely conﬁned to regional alterations ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Shi et al . , 2018 ; Gao et al . , 2021 ) . For instance , a previous study found that the strength of resting - state functional connectivity ( FC ) between subcortical regions , such as thalamus and pallidum , can positively predict the degree of creative thinking ( Gao et al . , 2021 ) . Chen et al . ( 2014 ) focused on individual diﬀerences in creativity , and revealed a negative relationship between the anterior cingulate ( ACC ) and prefrontal cortex in creativity . Besides , using an independent component analysis ( ICA ) , Shi et al . ( 2018 ) found that anterior default mode network ( DMN ) correlating with frontal - parietal network contributes to divergent thinking . It’s worth noting that the above studies mainly depended on seed - based or ICA methods , aiming at the explorations within particular brain networks . The results derived from these analyses are diﬀusely distributed . Thus , a voxel - wise whole - brain FC analysis is urgently needed , which may provide novel insight into the brain underpinnings of creative thinking , especially for IPS . Degree centrality ( DC ) , a commonly used graph theory - based network measurement at voxel level , could estimate the signiﬁcance of a speciﬁc region ( i . e . , node ) in the whole - brain network . This method doesn’t need priori deﬁnition of regions of interest ( ROIs ) , and can reveal details of the FC within the whole - brain network ( Zuo et al . , 2011 ) . Many researches have conﬁrmed DC indicator has physiological signiﬁcance , reﬂecting features of brain blood ﬂow and metabolism ( Liang et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2021 ) . Besides , DC measurements were proved to own good retest reliability ( Zuo and Xing , 2014 ) . Thus , researchers usually employed the DC method to depict characteristics of inherent brain networks underlying individual diﬀerences of cognitive process or psychiatric disorders ( Di Martino et al . , 2013 ; Sato et al . , 2015 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2021 ; Liu and Lai , 2022 ) . Inspired by these studies , this research aimed to utilize the DC method to carry out a whole - brain detection of hub areas , showing changed brain connectivity responsible for individual diﬀerences in IPS . Finally , we used a seed - based approach to further examine the FC patterns of each cluster founded in DC analysis . Based on previous studies ( Wei et al . , 2014 ; Huang et al . , 2015 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ; Benedek et al . , 2018 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ) , we predicted that hub regions , such as lateral or medial prefrontal cortex , may play a critical role in IPS , and IPS may be closely related to activations of the DMN . MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants Two criteria were used to recruit and select participants . Firstly , volunteers who signed up for the study were asked to ﬁll out the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory to assess their hand preference . Only right - handed respondents were included as participants . Secondly , volunteers were estimated further according to their self - reports , and met the criteria : no history of psychiatric illness , no brain injury , normal vision , and no history of neurologic disease . As a result of these recruited requirements , sixty - two healthy native Mandarin Chinese speakers ( 28 males / 34 females , aged 18 – 27 years old ) were selected as participants with an average age of 20 . 93 ( SD = 2 . 07 ) . Notably , all volunteers were enrolled randomly , and have passed the university entrance examination . They were supposed to have similar cognitive abilities . This research got ethical approval from Research Ethics Review Board of South China Normal University . All volunteers signed a consent form before participation . The Assessment of Individual Differences in Insight Problem Solving The research required participants ﬁrstly completed insight problem tasks , then received the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data acquisition . Speciﬁcally , individual diﬀerences of IPS were evaluated using the insightful Mandarin character chunk decomposition task , which consists of two tasks ( the low insightful task and high insightful task ) . In the low insight task , participants removed a compound character from the given Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 2 May 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 905806 fnbeh - 16 - 905806 May 5 , 2022 Time : 19 : 11 # 3 Lin et al . Brain Connectivity and Insight character to alter it into the target character . While in the high insight task , participants needed to remove an isolated character from the given character in order to obtain the target character . Previous studies have proved that the low and high insightful Mandarin character chunk decomposition tasks can successfully induce corresponding insight feelings , and details of the tasks can be found in these studies ( Lin et al . , 2019 , 2020 ) . Notably , the two insight tasks were together used to measure the individual diﬀerences of IPS . We ﬁrstly calculated the mean reaction time of both insight conditions . Secondly , the mean accuracy rates of the low and high insight conditions were computed . Finally , by dividing the mean reaction time into the mean accuracy rates , the inverse eﬃciency scores ( ES ) were obtained ( Townsend and Ashby , 1978 ) . Before analyzing , a log transform was performed on the inverse ES in order to address the skewness problem . There was a negative correlation between ES and individual diﬀerences of IPS . To put it another way , the lower the transformed ES values were , the better the insight performance . Upon completion of the behavioral tasks , all participants completed MRI scans , which consisted of structural scans ( 5 min ) , and resting - state scans ( 8 min ) . Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition Image collection was conducted with a 3 . 0 T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scanner with a 12 - channel head coil at SCNU . A foam padding was provided to keep participant’s head still and therefore reduced head movements . Both the resting - state and structural imaging data were collected in this research . However , only resting - state data were further analyzed . The structural data were collected for the purpose of normalization . All resting - state images were determined by a gradient echo - planar imaging sequence . Parameters are showed below : Repetition time = 2000 ms ; echo time = 30 ms ; image thickness = 3 . 5 mm ; ﬁeld of view = 204 × 204 mm 2 ; ﬂip angle = 90 ◦ ; data matrix = 64 × 64 ; 33 slices for a full brain . The brain anatomical images were acquired with a magnetization - radio - frequency pulses and rapid gradient - echo ( MPRAGE ) sequence . Parameters are showed below : Repetition time = 1900 ms ; echo time = 2 . 52 ms ; image thickness = 1 . 0 mm ; ﬂip angle = 9 ◦ ; ﬁeld of view = 256 × 256 mm 2 ; data matrix = 256 × 256 ; 176 slices for a full brain . MRI Data Process Data Preprocess The image data were preprocessed and analyzed using the DPABI toolbox ( Yan and Zang , 2010 ) . First , in order to achieve scanner equilibration , the ﬁrst ten images were removed . For the rest of 230 images , we further carried out a slice - timing correction and a head motion movement correction . It is worth noting that all the images fulﬁlled the head motion criteria : ≤ 2 . 5 mm translation ; ≤ 2 . 5 ◦ rotation . Then , the volumes were co - registered with the structural ones , and standardized into a voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm 3 , with a standard MNI template . Subsequently , all the volumes were further performed linear detrending and regressed out head motion parameters ( computed by Friston 24 - parameter model ) , white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid signal . Meanwhile , mean framewise displacement ( FD ) of head motion was acquired and then employed as a factor of no interest to be regressed out in group - level analyses ( Yan et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , temporal bandpass ﬁltering ( 0 . 01 – 0 . 08 Hz ) was conducted to minimize high - frequency physiological noise . Notably , in order to calculate the DC measurement , we didn’t perform smoothing for the images here considering previous studies ( Zuo et al . , 2011 ; Liu and Lai , 2022 ) . Conversely , when evaluating the resting - state FC , all the volumes were smoothed with a 4 mm full - width at half - maximum ( FWHM ) resolution in this preprocessing stage . Degree Centrality Analysis The preprocessed images were tackled with the DPABI toolbox to get the DC values . DC is a parameter of the whole - brain network . It refers to the amounts of edges linking to a node . To calculate DC , we built a voxel - based whole - brain functional network . Each voxel was considered as a node . Then , we computed the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients between each two voxels in the whole brain . The correlation coeﬃcient is an indicator of the weight of connection , also known as “the edge . ” We set a weight threshold of r > 0 . 25 ( Buckner et al . , 2009 ) . Edges with an index ≤ 0 . 25 were discarded since it may be a correlation caused by random errors . Besides , edges with a negative coeﬃcient were removed from the analysis . For each voxel , we calculated the DC ( i . e . , the sum of the threshold connections of each voxel ) , following these above - mentioned steps . We obtained a DC graph for each participant . All the DC graphs were then transformed using the Fisher - Z method for the purpose of normalization . Afterward , the normalized DC graphs were smoothed with a 4 mm FWHM resolution . In the end , a multiple regression model was performed to reveal the brain areas indicating prominent correlations between DC and individual diﬀerences of IPS ( measured by ES ) . Notably , ES was set as the regressor of interest . Potential confounding factors ( i . e . , age , gender , and mean FD ) were set as the regressors of no interest . Solving the multiple comparison problems , this research adopted a correction approach integrating voxel intensity ( uncorrected p < 0 . 005 ) and cluster extent ( FWE corrected p < 0 . 05 ) . Seed - Based Functional Connectivity Analysis We used signiﬁcant clusters found in the DC analysis as seed regions to compute FC alterations . For each seed , we estimated the mean time course within it , and then correlated it with the time course of other voxels within the gray matter mask . Afterward , the correlation coeﬃcients were performed with Fisher’s r - to - z transformation to fulﬁll normality purposes , resulting in seed - based z - FC map for each participant . Finally , a multiple regression model was also performed to reveal the brain areas indicating prominent correlations between the FC and individual diﬀerences of IPS ( measured by ES ) . Likewise , ES was set as the regressor of interest . Potential confounding factors ( i . e . , age , gender , and mean FD ) were set as the regressors of no interest .

Brain Connectivity and Insight this research adopted a correction approach integrating voxel intensity ( uncorrected p < 0 . 005 ) and cluster extent ( FWE corrected p < 0 . 05 ) . RESULTS Behavioral Data Mean ( ± SD ) accuracies of the low insightful task and high insightful task were 0 . 94 ± 0 . 06 and 0 . 88 ± 0 . 07 , respectively , and there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two tasks ( t = 7 . 59 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Mean ( ± SD ) response times of the low insightful task and high insightful task were 1294 . 98 ± 481 . 30 and 1506 . 46 ± 553 . 98 , respectively , and there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two tasks ( t = – 7 . 64 , p < 0 . 001 ) . It’s worth noting that here we took response times with accuracies together to calculate the ES , a measurement reﬂecting individual diﬀerence of IPS . The ES indicated a normal distribution with a mean ± SD of 3 . 16 ± 0 . 17 in the present study . Degree Centrality Table 1 and Figure 1 list the information on the clusters where there was a signiﬁcant correlation between DC and ES . Detailly , ES correlated positively with DC , located at the left inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG . L ) and left middle frontal gyrus / precentral gyrus ( MFG / PreCG . L ) . Besides , ES correlated negatively with DC in the right anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC . R ) and left / right brainstern / cerebellum / thalamus ( BSM / CRB / TLM . L / R ) . Seed - Based Functional Connectivity According to the results of DC analysis , four clusters were adopted as seed regions . We found sixteen signiﬁcant ES - positive connections ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ) . Speciﬁcally , the strength of FC between the seed , IFG . L , and the right lingual gyrus ( LING . R ) , IFG . L , right middle temporal gyrus ( MTG . R ) , PreCG . R , left middle temporal gyrus ( MTG . L ) , and left precuneus ( PCUN . L ) positively correlated with the ES .

L , and left / right supplementary motor area ( SMA . L / R ) also positively correlated with the ES . Notably , these ES - positive connections are mainly located in the DMN and executive control network ( ECN ) . DISCUSSION With graph theory - based approach , the present research has explored the brain connectivity patterns underlying individual diﬀerences of IPS , by integrating voxel - wise DC and seed - based FC methods . We found ES ( an indicator reﬂecting individual diﬀerence of IPS ) involved increased DC in the IFG . L and MFG / PreCG . L , while reduced DC in the ACC . R and BSM / CRB / TLM . L / R . Considering the inverse relationship between the ES and individual diﬀerence of IPS , IPS was thus related to reduced DC in the IFG . L and MFG / PreCG . L , suggesting network connections in these regions are reduced for IPS . Likewise , IPS was linked to increased DC in the ACC . R and BSM / CRB / TLM . L / R , implying network connections in these areas increase for IPS . Moreover , results of seed - based FC showed reduced connections from IFG . L and MFG / PreCG . L to dorsal / medial prefrontal cortex , lingual gyrus , temporal areas , and precuneus regions , mainly reﬂecting involvements of DMN and ECN in IPS . Reduced DC and network connections in IPS were found in the IFG . L and MFG / PreCG . L . These brain regions are main parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex ( Sasaki et al . , 2018 ) . The lateral prefrontal cortex , containing the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) and ventral lateral prefrontal cortex ( VLPFC ) , mainly mediates cognitive control ( Ochsner and Gross , 2005 ; Carballedo et al . , 2011 ) and executive functions through IFG - MFG - striatum circuits ( Quan et al . , 2013 ) . Besides , the DLPFC and VLPFC are also responsible for restraining dominant but disrelated responses and enabling cognitive ﬂexibility ( Derrfuss et al . , 2005 ; Volle et al . , 2011 ) , which involves key components of IPS . Regarding the process of IPS , quite a lot of studies reported that IPS involves processes of inhibitory control and decision making , since certain cognitive control resources are required to overcome the mind set in IPS ( Bowden , 1997 ; Knoblich et al . , 1999 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , our ﬁndings were in accord with previous IPS researches ( Gonen - Yaacovi et al . , 2013 ; Zhao et al . , 2014 ; Tik et al . , 2018 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ) . For instance , using Chinese “chengyu” riddles as insight stimuli , Zhao et al . ( 2014 ) found that verbal insight problem solving had an altered FC anchored in the lateral prefrontal cortex than ordinary problem solving . Therefore , based on the roles of the DLPFC , VLPFC , and the processes of IPS reported in previous studies , we suggest that decreased connectivity in lateral prefrontal cortex could be critical for IPS . Importantly , IFG . L and MFG / PreCG . L form the center of ECN , promoting cognitive and executive functions . Previous fMRI studies have identiﬁed changed ECN in IPS ( Tang et al . , 2015 ; Beaty et al . , 2016 ; Huang et al . , 2018 ) . For instance , using chunk decomposition paradigm to investigate neural underpinnings under IPS with a parametric fMRI design , Tang Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 4 May 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 905806 fnbeh - 16 - 905806 May 5 , 2022 Time : 19 : 11 # 5 Lin et al . Brain Connectivity and Insight FIGURE 1 | Clusters indicating correlations in weighted DC maps with ES . These brain clusters contain the IFG , MFG / PreCG , ACC , and BSM / CRB / TLM . Coordinates of Montreal Neurological Institute space were used in the present study .

( 2015 ) found that the ECN , such as DLPFC , determines optional ways of restructuring in IPS . In another study , regions in the ECN ( e . g . , LPFC ) were found to negotiate novelty processing in IPS ( Huang et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , altered connectivity of hub regions in ECN may represent a mechanism in IPS , in cases where many neural resources are required to select alternative ways of restructuring . The present study indicating a close relationship between ECN and individual diﬀerences of IPS may also support such an assumption . Furthermore , seed - based FC analysis for IPS showed ECN anchored in the IFG . L and MFG / PreCG . L were also correlated with the hub regions of DMN , such as MPFC . L / R , MTG . L , STG . R , and PCUN . L . The DMN was supposed to facilitate automated information processing ( Marron et al . , 2018 ) , and involve processes of self - monitoring , autobiographical memory retrieval , and mind wandering ( Bressler and Menon , 2010 ; Andrews - Hanna , 2012 ; Zabelina and Andrews - Hanna , 2016 ) . Accumulating evidence has showed that the DMN was related with creative thinking , including divergent thinking and IPS ( Beaty et al . , 2018 ; Fink et al . , 2018 ; Marron et al . , 2018 ; Lin et al . , 2020 ; Wu and Chen , 2021 ) . For example , Lin et al . ( 2020 ) found that activation in the DMN is a key signal discriminating the IPS from ordinary thinking . Moreover , several literatures indicated that both the DMN and ECN jointly support idea generation in creative performance ( Beaty et al . , 2016 ; Vatansever et al . , 2017 ; Beaty et al . , 2018 ) . Vatansever et al . ( 2017 ) suggested when autonomous associative processing from DMN fails to reach unpredictable and novel target , external attention information will be required from the ECN . Likewise , Beaty et al . ( 2016 ) inferred that the DMN can help to the producing of candidate thoughts , while the ECN may estimate the eﬃcacy of candidate thoughts and fulﬁll the goals of the task . They further suggested creative thinking might beneﬁt from dynamic interactions of the DMN and ECN . Therefore , our present study indicating a function connectivity between ECN and DMN in IPS may provide more evidence for this hypothesis . In the IPS , increased DC was detected in two other hub regions , the ACC . R and BSM / CRB / TLM . L / R . The ACC is mainly responsible for conﬂict control and detection ( MacDonald et al . , 2000 ; Anderson et al . , 2009 ; Abe et al . , 2018 ; Holroyd and Verguts , 2021 ) . For instance , high conﬂict induces strong ACC activity when performing Stroop task ( MacDonald et al . , 2000 ) .

Brain Connectivity and Insight FIGURE 2 | Altered network connectivity in the individual differences of insightful problem solving , using two seed clusters in the DC correlation analysis .

L , left precentral gyrus ; ECN , executive control network ; DMN , default mode network . Several literatures have highlighted the ACC’s importance in IPS , and the ACC participated diﬀerentially in generating insight and non - insight solutions ( Benedek et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2018a ; Lin et al . , 2020 ; Becker et al . , 2021 ) . In a review study , authors claimed that the BSM - thalamus - amygdala circuit plays a pivotal role in modulating and organizing emotion - related processing ( Venkatraman et al . , 2017 ) . As we know , one striking feature of IPS is that individuals can experience positive emotions , such as the aha feelings ( Luo and Niki , 2003 ; Shen et al . , 2018b ) . We deduced that the BSM is related to the aha feelings in IPS . The TLM is the information relay station of the whole brain , where information was selected for further processing ( Van Den Heuvel and Sporns , 2011 ; Boccia et al . , 2015 ; Jung et al . , 2015 ) . Researchers suggested the TLM was linked to information ﬁltering and cognitive control of the prefrontal cortex , and thus facilitated cognitive ﬂexibility in creative thinking ( Jung et al . , 2015 ) . Here , our study showing an increased connectivity in TLM may provide evidence for the role of cognitive ﬂexibility in IPS . In addition , previous studies reported the CRB was responsible for cognitive control and executive functions , especially for the visual information ( Keren - Happuch et al . , 2014 ; Ogawa et al . , 2018 ; Schmahmann et al . , 2019 ) . Speciﬁcally , Ogawa et al . ( 2018 ) proposed that restricting visual information can boost representational changes in creative insight . They further pointed out that the cerebellar networks coupled with the DMN may responsible for higher cognitive function , which could modulate the performance of TABLE 2 | Brain regions showing correlations between the SBFC and ES .

Besides , a recent review conﬁrmed that cerebellum acts as a hub critical for information detection , prediction and preparation , which subserves cognition .

Our results in this research are in accord with these previous literatures , supplying extra evidences that the ACC . R and BSM / CRB / TLM . L / R could involve individual diﬀerences of IPS . Limitations Several limitations in this research should be tackled in future . First , increased and decreased connections can involve diﬀerent physiological functions ( Chelaru and Dragoi , 2008 ) . For example , increased connectivity is linked with strengthen aﬀerent information and facilitate signal selection . However , the meaning of increased and reduced connections in brain networks has not yet been clariﬁed in the present study . Physiology researches will be required to tackle this issue in the future . Secondly , our FC in this study was non - directional . Other directed FC analyses , including Granger causality analyses , are urgently needed to provide direction information of the cortical networks in IPS . Finally , the present study focused on the individual diﬀerences of chunk decomposition , which is a special form of IPS . However , insight can vary diﬀerently . A previous study suggested that another crucial form of IPS , constraint relaxation , is worth further studying ( Huang et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , future studies should be conducted to reveal the neural basis of Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www . frontiersin . org 6 May 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 905806 fnbeh - 16 - 905806 May 5 , 2022 Time : 19 : 11 # 7 Lin et al . Brain Connectivity and Insight constraint relaxation in IPS , and to enrich insight theory and the understanding of individual diﬀerences in IPS . CONCLUSION This study used a DC method , along with seed - based FC analysis , to explore the whole - brain intrinsic connectivity pattern underlying the individual diﬀerences of IPS . The results showed that the connectivity density is altered in four clusters ( i . e . , IFG . L , MFG / PreCG . L , ACC . R and BSM / CRB / TLM . L / R ) . Moreover , changed connectivity could be involved in the key nodes of DMN and ECN , which plays an important role in IPS . These results highlight the signiﬁcance of brain connectivity in IPS , and might supply valuable information for the neural basis of individual diﬀerences in IPS .
