Making efforts to explore novel molecular biomarkers and serve as potential disease indicators , which is essential to effectively enhance the prognosis and individualized treatment of BC . FBXO proteins act as the core component of E3 ubiquitin ligase , which play essential regulators roles in multiple cellular processes . Recently , research has indicated that FBXOs also play significant roles in cancer development . However , the molecular functions of these family members in BC have not been fully elucidated . Methods : In this research , we investigated the expression data , survival relevance and mutation situation of 10 FBXO members ( FBXO1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 16 , 17 , 22 , 28 , 31 and 45 ) in patients with BC from the Oncomine , GEPIA , HPA , Kaplan – Meier Plotter , UALCAN and cBioPortal databases . The high transcriptional levels of FBXO1 in different subtypes of BC were verified by immunohistochemical staining and the specific mutations of FBXO1 were obtained from COSMIC data - base . Top 10 genes with the highest correlation to FBXO1 were identified through cBioPortal and COXPRESdb tools . Additionally , functional enrichment analysis , PPI network and survival relevance of FBXO1 and co - expressed genes in BC were obtained from DAVID , STRING , UCSC Xena , GEPIA , bc - GenExMiner and Kaplan – Meier Plotter databases . FBXO1 siRNAs were transfected into MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cell lines . Expression of FBXO1 in BC cell lines was detected by western - blot and RT - qPCR . Cell proliferation was detected by using CCK - 8 kit and colony formation assay . Cell migration was detected by wound ‐ healing and transwell migration assay . Results : We found that FBXO2 , FBXO6 , FBXO16 and FBXO17 were potential favorable prognostic factors for BC . FBXO1 , FBXO5 , FBXO22 , FBXO28 , FBXO31 and FBXO45 may be the independent poor prognostic factors for BC . All of them were correlated to clinicopathological staging . Moreover , knockdown of FBXO1 in MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cell lines resulted in decreased cell proliferation and migration in vitro . We identified that FBXO1 was an excellent molecu - lar biomarker and therapeutic target for different molecular typing of BC . Conclusion : This study implies that FBXO1 , FBXO2 , FBXO5 , FBXO6 , FBXO16 , FBXO17 , FBXO22 , FBXO28 , FBXO31 and FBXO45 genes are potential clinical targets and prognostic biomarkers for patients with different molecular typing of © The Author ( s ) 2021 .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 Background Breast cancer ( BC ) is among the most common malig - nant tumor ( 11 . 6 % ) and the leading cause of cancer death ( 6 . 6 % ) globally in women [ 1 ] . Classical clinical prognostic biomarkers such as estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progester - one receptor ( PR ) , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) have played crucial roles in determi - nation of which patients may benefit from target ther - apy or endocrine treatment [ 2 ] . However , considering the heterogeneity of tumor and individual differences in patients , the existing biomarkers have some limitations in predicting the prognosis of BC . Hence , there is an urgent need to explore novel molecular biomarkers as prognos - tic indicators in the field of clinical research , which per - haps contribute to improve the prognosis and guide the individualized treatment strategies for BC patients . Ubiquitin proteasome pathway is the most important protein degradation pathway with high selectivity in human , which plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and pathological mechanism of tumor . In ubiquitination cas - cade pathway , E3 Ubiquitin ligase is known as the second prevalent tumor ‐ related functional gene family after pro - tein kinases , which is a novel anticancer drug target , for its specific recognition of target protein by proteasome [ 3 ] . F - box proteins are the core component of the SKP1 - cullin 1 - F - box ( SCF ) - type E3 ubiquitin ligase , which can be classified into three sub - families : ( 1 ) F - box with leucine rich amino acid repeats ( FBXL ) ; ( 2 ) F - box with WD 40 amino acid repeats ( FBXW ) ; ( 3 ) F - box only with uncharacterized domains ( FBXO ) [ 3 ] . Generally , F - box proteins act as molecular regulators in multiple biologi - cal processes of cell like cell cycle , epithelial - mesenchy - mal transition ( EMT ) , cell apoptosis and many signaling pathways related to tumor such as P13K - AKT - mTOR , p53 and NRF2 [ 4 , 5 ] . F - box proteins directly bind to substrates which modified by proper post - translational modification , and mediate ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein [ 5 ] . As the largest sub - family of F - box proteins , FBXO has 37 members , it has been verified that many of them are closely related to tumor biological processes according to many studies . FBXO1 , also known as cyclin F ( CCNF ) , mainly con - tains a cyclin box domain . The main function of FBXO1 is participating in centrosome duplication and DNA repair through SCF - type E3 ligase [ 6 ] . It participates in regulation of various cell cycle - related processes includ - ing DNA replication and repair , centrosome duplication , maintenance of genome stability [ 7 ] . FBXO2 ( Fbs1 or FBG1 ) functions as a component of the S phase kinase - associated protein 1 - cullin 1 - F - box protein ( SKP1 - CUL1 - SCF ) ubiquitin ligase complex , which tends to distribute in human brain related to nervous or psychical diseases . The specific substrates of FBXO2 are high - mannose type asparagine ( N ) - linked glycoprotein [ 8 ] . FBXO5 ( Emi1 / FBX5 ) has been suggested to play crucial roles in the development of HCC , cervical cancer and squamous - cell lung carcinoma in the latest research on bioinformat - ics analysis [ 9 – 11 ] . It has been proved that FBXO5 con - nects with the anaphase promoting complex / cyclosome ( APC / C ) co - activator proteins to inhibit APC / C activa - tion , and stabilizes ubiquitin substrates which has onco - genic activity to govern cell cycle progression to S phase and mitosis [ 12 ] . Impaired expression of FBXO6 ( also called FBG2 ) increases the therapeutic resistance in can - cer cells by inducing the degradation of target molecules in ubiquitin ‐ mediated cellular pathways . Zhang et al . [ 13 ] have found that FBXO6 facilitates the ubiquitination and mediates the degradation of Chk1 to increase certain drugs resistance of tumor cells . As the component of the SCF complex , FBXO16 interacts physically with the C - terminal domain of nuclear β - catenin protein to pro - mote its lysine 48 - linked polyubiquitination and medi - ate degradation of β - catenin [ 14 ] . It inhibits EMT by attenuating the levels of β - catenin . The main function of FBXO17 is targeting glycogen synthase kinase - 3β to the E3 ubiquitin ligase protein complex for polyubiquitina - tion and proteasomal degradation [ 15 ] . Recent studies have showed that overexpression of FBXO17 increases cell proliferation coupled with Akt activation in lung adenocarcinoma [ 16 ] . FBXO22 is a hemedependent binding protein to Bach1 , which is also a pro ‐ metastatic transcription factor [ 17 ] . In BC , FBXO22 determines the sensitivity of endocrine treatment by making KDM4B ubiquitination complexed with unliganded or selective estrogen receptor modulators ( SERMs ) ‐ bound estro - gen receptor ( ER ) [ 18 ] . FBXO28 regulates topoisomer - ase IIα decatenation activity and plays an important role in maintaining cell genomic stability [ 19 ] . It has been reported that FBXO28 may have a carcinogenic effect through non - proteolytic ubiquitination of MYC143 to stimulate transcription in BC [ 20 ] . FBXO31 , also known as FBXO14 , have been showed as a tumor suppressor protein . It targets and ubiquitylates slug for proteasomal degradation . Due to its growth - suppression activity , it is BC . In addition , the overexpression of FBXO1 is always found in breast cancer and predicts disadvantageous progno - sis , implicating it could as an appealing therapeutic target for breast cancer patients .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 downregulated in many kinds of cancers [ 21 ] . FBXO45 is an evolutionary conserved F - box protein , it contains a conserved F - box domain and a SPRY domain , which recruits alternate RING - finger protein substrates to the ubiquitin ligase complex [ 22 ] . There is an evidence that FBXO45 can target p73 in vitro and in vivo to regulate the apoptosis mediated by p53 in tumor cells [ 23 ] . Although the functions of FBXO family members have been studied in some researches as mentioned above , the expression profiles of important FBXO family members in BC and the relationship between expression of FBXO genes and prognosis of BC are still worth exploring . In this article , we firstly evaluated the expression levels , mutation situations and prognosis relevance of the 10 important FBXO family members ( FBXO1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 16 , 17 , 22 , 28 , 31 and 45 ) , which have intimate connection with BC . Therefore , we screened out FBXO1 , which is overexpressed in BC and significantly correlated with the prognosis of BC patients . To further analyze the cellular function of FBXO1 , we have successfully established the FBXO1 - knockdown breast cancer cell lines and explore the effect of FBXO1 on cell function . Next , we screened out the functional gene cluster of FBXO1 and con - structed the Protein – Protein Interaction ( PPI ) network by analyzing large datasets available in various public databases . Material and methods Oncomine database The human mRNA expression levels of FBXO gene fam - ily members in BC were compared with normal tissues by using the Oncomine gene expression array database ( http : / / www . oncom ine . org ) , an integrated data - mining platform . Students’ t test was adopted and transcriptional data of FBXOs were represented as log2 - transformed form . We conducted the selection criteria as follows : Statistically significant P - values threshold < 1E - 2 , fold change > 2 and the gene rank in the top 10 % . All statistical methods and data source were acquired directly from the online database . The gene expression profiling interactive analysis ( GEPIA ) dataset The transcriptional levels of FBXOs in breast invasive car - cinoma ( BRCA ) and normal breast tissue were obtained from the GEPIA database ( http : / / gepia . cance r - pku . cn ) , and a public dataset assembles varieties of gene expres - sion profiling functional modules , which was developed by scientists of Peking University [ 24 ] . We focused on the analytical results among intrinsic subtypes of BRCA and normal tissue . The correlation analysis of FBXO1 and related genes in BRCA tumor and normal tissue data - sets was based on the GTEx and TCGA data . By using one - way ANOVA test , we defined the absolute value of Log2 ( FC ) cutoff is 1 ; statistically significant p - value Cut - off is 1E - 3 . The linear dependence ( correlation ) between FBXO1 and hub genes was measured using Spearman’s correlation coefficient . The results were used the non - log scale for calculation and used the log - scale axis for visualization . UALCAN database UALCAN database ( http : / / ualca n . path . uab . edu / ) is a publicly accessible dataset for analyzing 31 cancer types’ OMICS data , which is built on PERL - CGI with high qual - ity graphics using JavaScript and CSS . These resources allow researchers to understand the impact of gene expression levels and gather relative clinicopathologi - cal parameters of various individual cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) [ 25 ] . We acquired the FBXOs’ transcriptional data from TCGA pan - cancer view and major subclasses and stages of BRCA by using UALCAN database . The mRNA information was unified as transcripts per million ( TPM ) reads for data compari - son from different sources . P - value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . The Human Protein Atlas ( HPA ) database The Human Protein Atlas ( HPA ) ( https : / / www . prote inatl as . org ) aims to provide 24 , 000 kinds of human protein distribution information in different tissues and cells , and it displays for more than 20 kind of cancer types’ immu - nohistochemical staining results . In this work , for com - paring the expression difference of the FBXO protein , we showed the immunohistochemical staining images between breast tumor and normal tissues from the HPA database to observe the tissue location of the target pro - tein directly . TCGA dataset and cBioPortal online tools cBioPortal for cancer genomics is an open source resource for interactive exploration of multiple cancer genomic datasets . It allows researchers to visualize and analyze multidimensional genetic changes in different samples , genes and pathways [ 26 ] . The Breast Invasive Carcinoma of the cancer genome atlas ( TCGA , Firehose Legacy , 1108 total samples ) was selected for genom - ics analysis . By using the cBioPortal online tool ( http : / / www . cbiop ortal . org ) , we investigated FBXO gene family’s predicted copy number alterations , mRNA expression ( RNA sequencing [ RNA - seq ] version ( v . ) 2 RSEM ) , gene correlations and Mutations situation , the results were automatically calculated using a Z - score ± 2 . 0 , Pearson’s correction was considered .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 Bc‑GenExMiner ( v4 . 4 ) online tool Breast Cancer Gene - Expression Miner ( bc - GenExMiner v4 . 4 ) online tool ( http : / / bcgen ex . centr egaud uchea u . fr / BC - GEM / GEM - Accue il . php ) is a statistical mining tool of published BC transcriptomic data ( DNA microarrays [ n = 10001 ] and RNA - seq [ n = 4712 ] ) . It incorporates three classical mining functions : correlation , expres - sion and prognosis [ 27 ] . According to common clinical parameters , we analyzed the FBXO gene family’s expres - sion data in different patient groups . The subtypes of parameter include age , nodal status , ER , PR , HER - 2 , Basal - like statues , Triple - negative statues ( IHC ) and P53 status ( sequence - based ) . Scarff - Bloom - Richardson ( SBR ) grade , and Nottingham prognostic index ( NPI ) . The cor - relative heatmap of FBXO1 and the cell cycle pathway related hub genes was drawn by using the correlation module . Kaplan – Meier plotter ( KM plotter ) database for survival analysis We evaluated the prognostic significance of FBXO fam - ily members in KM plotter online database ( http : / / kmplo t . com / ) . The KM plotter was utilized to estimate the effect of 54 k genes ( mRNA , miRNA , protein ) on sur - vival in 21 cancer types based on the gene arrays , RNA - sequence or next generation sequencing ( for mutation data ) . Sources for the databases include GEO , EGA , and TCGA . The correlation between the target gene mRNA expression levels and disease - free survival rate ( DFS ) , the overall survival ( OS ) rate , distance metastasis free survival ( DMFS ) and post progression survival ( PPS ) in BC groups were calculated by the Kaplan – Meier curve and log - rank test . The results were shown in the Kaplan – Meier survival plots . Hazard ratio ( HR ) and 95 % con - fidence were calculated automatically by website tool . The values of each group are shown as the mean ± SD . P - value < 0 . 05 was regarded as statistically significant by using Log - rank test . University of California Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) cancer genomics browser UCSC Xena functional genomic browser is a database maintained by the University of California , Santa Cruz ( UCSC ) . It is a new generation of online data analysis and visualization platform integrating analysis , visualization and galaxy . This tool contains the common standardized the data from TCGA , ICGC , TARGET , GTEX and CCLE datasets [ 28 ] . We used the UCSC Xena browser ( http : / / xena . ucsc . edu / ) to explore the correlation between FBXO1 and co - expression genes expression in different BC subtypes . The result of the comparison was evaluated by Spearman’s correlation and represented in heat - map form . Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ( COSMIC ) database COSMIC is the world’s largest and most comprehensive resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer ( https : / / cance r . sange r . ac . uk / cosmi c ) . It includes somatic mutation data from different research institutions and databases , and provides convenient browsing , retrieval and downloading functions . The main goal is to conduct in - depth study on cell samples com - monly used in cancer research and analyze their muta - tion information [ 29 ] . We used the pie charts to depict the mutations in FBXO1 in BC and the distribution and substitutions on the coding strand . Functional enrichment analysis COXPRESdb is a comprehensive dataset that comparing coexpression - gene in seven model animals ( https : / / coxpr esdb . jp / ) [ 30 ] . We used cBioPortal database and COX - PRESdb dataset to screen out the top human 150 genes with the strongest correlation with FBXO1 , and obtained the intersect genes from both of databases . The functions of FBXO1 and the genes significantly associated with FBXO1 were predicted by gene ontology ( GO ) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( KEGG ) pathway analysis . GO enrichment includes biological process ( BP ) , cell component ( CC ) , molecular function ( MF ) . By referring to STRING database ( https : / / strin g - db . org / ) , we screened the items with corrected P value ≤ 0 . 05 . A total of 313 biological processes , 36 molecular functions and 56 cell components are related . Using R 3 . 6 . 3 soft - ware , we installed clusterProfiler , enrichplot and ggplot2 package to draw the histogram and bubble chart of the most remarkable results of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis . Using the Database for Annotation , Visualiza - tion and Integrated Discovery ( DAVID ) database ( http : / / david . abcc . ncifc rf . gov / ) , we annotated the key targets in hsa04110 via Fisher’s exact test : Cell cycle pathway to reveal the possible pathogenesis mediated by critical genes in breast adenocarcinoma . Protein – protein interactions ( PPI ) network analysis The PPI of co - expressed genes was retrieved from STRING database with an interaction score > 0 . 4 , and we reconstructed the data via Cytoscape software ( ver - sion 3 . 6 . 1 ) [ 31 ] . Molecular Complex Detection ( MCODE ) plug - in was employed to locate the densest connected module to find hub genes of clusters based on topology . The parameter standard as follows : MCODE score > 5 points , degree cut - off is 2 , node score cut - off is 0 . 2 , Max depth is 100 , and k - Score is 2 . The top 10 hub genes were verified according to the degree - rank by CytoHubba plug - in . Next , we analyzed the potential biological pro - cess of hub genes by using BINGO plug - in . We selected Page 5 of 25 Liu et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 hypergeometic text and Benjamin & Hochberg False Discovery Correction ( FDR ) method . The significance P - value set to 0 . 05 . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) The IHC analysis was conducted to evaluate the expres - sion of FBXO1 in different clinical molecular subtypes of BC tissues . In brief , following 4 % formalin fixation and paraffin - embedding of specimens , 3 μm thick sections were incubated with primary Rabbit anti - FBXO1 anti - body ( 1 : 200 , Sigma , Louis , MO , USA ) overnight at 4 °C , washed 3 times with PBS , and incubated with the sec - ondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C and streptavidin - HRP .

Cell viability and colony formation assay Cell viability was detected by CCK - 8 assay using a kit provided by Dojindo Molecular Technologies . Cell sus - pension with a cell density of 4 × 10 3 cells / ml was pre - pared using cells of two cell lines . Then 4 × 10 3 cells in 0 . 1 ml cell suspension were used to fill each well of a 96 - well plate . Cells were cultured at 37 ºC with 5 % CO 2 , and 10 μl of CCK - 8 was added into each well at 24 , 48 and 72 h later . Cells were cultured for another 4 h and a microplate reader was used to measure OD values at 450 nm . In colony formation assay , cells ( 10 4 cells / well ) were seeded in 6 - well plate and supported for 7 – 14 days in a humidified incubator with 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 until colo - nies of cells appeared .

Results Significant transcriptional levels of FBXOs in BC In order to explore the prognostic and potential thera - peutic values of different FBXO members in BC , the ONCOMINE databases were used to compare the mRNA expression levels of FBXOs in BC samples with normal breast samples ( Fig . 1 ) . Ten FBXO genes were identified within the human BC cells . According to our findings , FBXO1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 16 , 17 , 22 , 28 and 45 were remarkably altered in different types of BC cells . FBXO1 , 6 , 16 , 28 , and 45 were all expressed at high levels in various path - ological types of BC . FBXO2 and 17 were significantly downregulated in different types . As for FBXO5 and 22 , they showed the contrary expression pattern . The specific fold change , p - value , and the value of t - test of different significantly statistical analysis were showed in Table 1 [ 8 , 22 , 32 – 36 ] . Using ONCOMINE and UALCAN databases , we compared the expression situations of FBXOs in more than 20 types of tumor and normal samples across TCGA datasets to explore the FBXOs’ regular pattern of expres - sion ( Additional file 1 : Figure S1 , Additional file 2 : Figure S2 ) . Next , we explored the distinction between the mRNA expression of FBXO family members and normal breast tissues in different subcategory of breast invasive carci - noma ( BRCA ) in GEPIA database . The overall results indicated that the expression levels of FBXO1 , FBXO6 , FBXO16 , FBXO22 and FBXO45 in BRCA were higher than those in normal tissues , and the expression levels of FBXO17 and FBXO31 were lower in BRCA samples ( Fig . 1 ) . The correlation between mRNA expression levels of FBXOs and clinicopathological parameters of BC We analyzed the transcriptional levels of FBXOs in dif - ferent molecular subtypes of BRCA by using GEPIA database , and all data was from TCGA and GTEx data - sets . Significantly increased FBXO1 , FBXO6 , FBXO22 , and FBXO45 were observed in all BRCA subtypes com - pared with normal breast groups . The expression levels of FBXO17 and FBXO31 were significantly decreased in all BRCA subtypes . As for FBXO2 , it was found expressed lower in HER2 and luminal B subtypes of BRCA . The mRNA of FBXO5 showed up - regulated in Basal - like , HER2 and luminal B subtypes . In luminal - types breast carcinoma , FBXO16 was inclined to over - express in luminal A and B groups and FBXO28 was a potential up - regulated biomarker of luminal B groups ( Fig . 2 ) . Based on aforesaid research , we probed into the cor - relation between the mRNA expression of FBXOs and clinicopathological stage of BRCA patients via UALCAN database . In all family members , there were consider - able differences of transcriptional levels between normal groups and the patient groups divided by different path - ological stages . Among the results , FBXO1 , FBXO5 , FBXO6 , FBXO16 , FBXO22 , FBXO28 and FBXO45 were up - regulated in the pathological stage groups , FBXO2 , FBXO17 and FBXO31 were negative expression factors in BRCA patients . More details of expression differences were showed in Fig . 3 , P < 0 . 05 was considered to be sta - tistically significant ( * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . We also used bc - GenExMiner ( v4 . 4 ) online tool to assess the relationship between FBXOs expression lev - els and various clinical features of BC patients based on RNA - seq technology ( Table 2 ) . The clinical features include age , nodal metastasis status , ER / PR / HER2 status , basal - like statues , triple - negative statues ( TNBC ) , P53 status , Scarff Bloom & Richardson grade status ( SBR ) and Nottingham Prognostic Index ( NPI ) . The table showed clearly that both of FBXO1 and FBXO45 had significant high - expression differences in the clinical patient groups of younger age ( Age < 51 ) , lymph nodes metastasis , ER ( − ) , PR ( − ) , HER2 ( + ) , basal - like subtype , triple - negative subtype , P53 gene mutation , level III of SBR and level III of NPI . The results implied that FBXO1 and FBXO45 were positively correlated with the types of highly malig - nant and poor - prognostic BC , which have the features of low differentiation , high invasiveness , easy to metastasize and relapse . It means that FBXO1 and FBXO45 could be potential biomarkers to identify special types of BC . Next , we provided the immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) outcomes from HPA database to verify the difference of protein expression of FBXO family members from Page 7 of 25 Liu et al .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 The genetic alteration and mutation information of FBXO family members We analyzed the FBXO genes’ alterations and mutation situation in the cBioPortal online tool for breast inva - sive carcinoma ( TCGA , Firehose Legacy ) . As showed in Fig . 5a , target genes were altered in 723 of 1093 patient cases with the percent of 66 . 15 % . The highest frequency of alterations was found in FBXO28 ( 395 of 1093 sam - ples , 36 . 14 % ) , with mRNA up - regulation of 22 . 6 % ( 247 cases ) , genetic amplification of 5 . 76 % ( 63 cases ) , mRNA down - regulation of 0 . 46 % ( 5 cases ) and other multi - ple alterations of 7 . 32 % ( 80 cases ) ( Fig . 5a , b ) . The sec - ond gene was FBXO1 , and it altered in 11 . 89 % of 1093 patient cases . The main genetic alterations involved mRNA up - regulation ( 70 cases , 6 . 4 % ) , genetic ampli - fication ( 46 cases , 4 . 21 % ) , mutation ( 5 cases , 0 . 46 % ) , deep deletion ( 1 case , 0 . 09 % ) and other multiple alter - ations ( 8 cases , 0 . 73 % ) ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Other gene altera - tions included FBXO2 ( 38 of 1093 samples , 3 . 48 % ) , FBXO5 ( 93 of 1093 samples , 8 . 51 % ) , FBXO6 ( 52 of 1093 samples , 4 . 76 % ) , FBXO16 ( 95 of 1093 samples , 8 . 87 % ) , FBXO17 ( 101 of 1093 samples , 9 . 24 % ) , FBXO22 ( 103 of 1093 samples , 9 . 42 % ) , FBXO31 ( 99 of 1093 samples , 9 . 06 % ) and FBXO45 ( 39 of 1093 samples , 3 . 57 % ) . The specific percentage of each gene alteration is shown in Fig . 5b . The largest proportion of alterations was high mRNA expression , especially in FBXO2 , FBXO5 , FBXO6 , FBXO17 and FBXO22 . Interestingly , there was no overexpression of mRNA was detected in FBXO45 , but it had high frequency of genetic amplification of 3 . 48 % ( 38 cases ) . Furthermore , we extracted the gene mutation information of the FBXOs from cBioPortal website tool . The overall somatic mutation frequency was very low . The frequency of FBXO1 and FBXO17 was 0 . 5 % , the frequency of FBXO28 and FBXO31 was 0 . 3 % , the rest members’ mutation frequency was no more than 0 . 2 % . Figure 5c displayed the specific muta - tion site in FBXOs DNA sequences . The green dots indicate missense mutations and the black ones mean truncating sites . These results illustrated that the ten FBXOs members had excellent genetic stability as potential BC universal biomarkers . Prognostic values of FBXOs’ mRNA expression levels in BC patients In order to evaluate the clinical significance of FBXOs , we used publicly Kaplan – Meier Plotter tools to explore the correlation between FBXO family members’ transcrip - tional level and the survival of patients with overall BC and different molecular subtypes of BC patients further . The main parameters of survival analysis include relapse free survival ( RFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , distant metas - tasis free survival ( DMFS ) and post progression survival ( PPS ) . Survival curves according to Kaplan ‐ Meier showed in Fig . 6 , suggesting that high mRNA levels of FBXO1 , 5 , 31 and 45 were significantly associated with worse prog - nosis in BC patients . By contrast , high transcription lev - els of FBXO2 , 6 , 16 , 17 symbolized a better prognosis of BC patients ( P < 0 . 05 ) . Moreover , we found that increased expression of FBXO1 mRNA revealed a significant cor - relation with worse RFS , OS and DMFS in overall BC patients ( Fig . 6 ) , as well as in luminal A subtype ( Addi - tional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . The high mRNA levels of FBXO2 was significantly associated with better RFS , OS and DMFS in overall BC patients ( Fig . 6 ) . In luminal B and HER2 subtypes , FBXO2 symbolized a better progno - sis similarly ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . The increased transcriptional levels of FBXO5 were related to poor RFS , OS , DMFS and PPS in overall BC and luminal A subtype patients ( Fig . 6 ) . In luminal B and triple - negative sub - types , high expression of FBXO5 was related to poor RFS ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . FBXO6 is a marker for good prognosis of BC patients , high mRNA level of FBXO6 meaning better RFS , OS , DMFS in overall patient groups ( Fig . 6 ) . Increased expression of FBXO6 was related to better RFS in HER2 subtypes and better RFS , OS in TNBC ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . As for FBXO16 and FBXO17 , they are favorable prognosis markers in BC ( Fig . 6 ) . High transcriptional levels of FBXO16 was asso - ciated with better RFS and OS in luminal A and better RFS in luminal B of BC groups ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . Increased mRNA levels of FBXO17 revealed a sig - nificant correlation with better PPS in HER2 BC patients ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . The overexpres - sion of FBXO22 was only related to worse OS in HER2 BC ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) and overexpression of FBXO28 was only related to worse RFS in luminal B and TNBC types of BC ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . High transcription level of FBXO31 was interrelated with poor RFS and OS in overall BC and poor RFS is luminal A , luminal B and HER2 subtypes patients ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . FBXO45 is a poor prognosis marker in BC . We found that it was related to worse RFS and OS in overall BC when overexpressed . In luminal subtypes of BC , high transcriptional level of it also suggested poor RFS and OS ( Additional file 3 : Figure S3 ) . In a conclu - sion , FBXO2 , FBXO6 , FBXO16 and FBXO17 were poten - tial favorable prognostic factors for BC . FBXO1 , FBXO5 , FBXO22 , FBXO28 , FBXO31 and FBXO45 may be the independent poor prognostic factors in BC . Functional enrichment analysis of FBXO1 and co‑expressed genes in BC All our preliminary results throw light on the impor - tance of FBXO1 . As a novel biomarker in human BC , FBXO1 may play a crucial role in the process of Page 15 of 25 Liu et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 tumorigenesis and development and may be the poten - tial target of precision therapy for patients with BC . We further performed the IHC staining in clinical different molecular subtypes of BC tissues to verify the expres - sion situation of FBXO1 protein . Our IHC results showed that significantly increased FBXO1 was observed highly expressed in all clinical subtypes of BC tissues than in the normal tissues ( Fig . 7a ) . The additional clinical informa - tion of samples used in IHC assay was showed in Addi - tional file 4 : Table S1 . Next , we analyzed the specific mutations of FBXO1 in BC by employing the COSMIC database . The largest proportion of mutations were mis - sense substitution ( 15 % ) and synonymous substitution ( 15 % ) . The largest proportion of nucleotide changes was C > T ( 41 . 67 % ) , the rest included 8 . 33 % of A > G , C > A , C > G , G > A , G > C , G > T and T > C ( Fig . 7b ) . Then We screened the top 150 co - expressed genes that were most related to FBXO1 from the cBioPortal and COXPRESdb online tools . The top 20 genes from both databases were displayed in Fig . 7c , d . We obtained a cohort of 108 crossed genes shown by Venn diagram in Fig . 7e . GO enrichment analysis indicated that the biologi - cal processes ( BP ) including mitotic nuclear division , chromosome segregation , nuclear division and orga - nelle fission were mostly significantly regulated by the FBXO1 and co - expressed genes alterations in breast Fig . 6 The prognostic values of FXBO family members in BC patients .

Besides , as molecu - lar function ( MF ) , microtubule binding , tubulin binding and ATPase activity were mostly significantly affected by targeted genes in Fig . 7g . KEGG analysis demonstrated the pathways were mostly correlated with the functions of FBXO1 and co - expressed genes shown in bubble chart ( Fig . 7f ) .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 c d e g f Fig . 7 continued Page 18 of 25 Liu et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 genes participated in Table 3 . Furthermore , using DAVID database , we marked the key points regulated by FBXO1 and co - expressed genes alteration refer to Additional file 5 : Figure S4 . Collectively , through experiment and database analysis , FBXO1 protein was truly increased in BC tissues . It may be an excellent therapeutic target for clinical BC patients because the stability of FBXO1 gene is of a high degree and the mutations are very rare . More - over , GO and KEGG analysis suggested that FBXO1 and 108 co - expressed genes may play essential roles in regu - lating the tumorigenesis and proliferation in BC . Knockdown of FBXO1 suppresses the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells In order to verify the results of above bioinformatics analysis , we further analyzed the FBXO1 protein levels in breast cancer and normal breast cell lines by Western blotting . FBXO1 was highly expressed in various breast cancer cell lines ( MCF7 , MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 468 , SK - BR3 , T47D , HCC1954 and BT474 ) , the expression levels were significantly higher than that in normal breast cell line ( MCF - 10A ) ( Fig . 8a ) . To examine the effect of FBXO1 in breast cancer cell lines , MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 were successfully transfected with si ‐ FBXO1 to knockdown expression of FBXO1 and verified by Real - time qPCR , Western - blot analysis and FAM - fluorescence detection ( Fig . 8b – d ) . First of all , the CCK - 8 assay was used to measure the proliferation of siRNA ‐ transfected cells . The MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cell lines , treated with si ‐ FBXO1 # 1 and # 2 , revealed the lower prolifera - tive ability compared with the negative control groups ( Fig . 8e ) . Besides , it turned out that colony formation in MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells was significantly reduced after FBXO1 depletion ( Fig . 8f ) . Subsequently , we found that FBXO1 knockdown caused an apparent suppression of cell migration in MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231cell lines ( Fig . 8g , h ) . In conclusion , these results demonstrated that the knockdown of FBXO1 protein inhibited the pro - liferation and migration of breast cancer cells . Screening and functional analysis of 10 hub genes in Protein – Protein Interaction ( PPI ) network of FBXO1 Combined using the STRING database and Cytoscape software , we constructed a PPI network of the co - expressed 108 genes of FBXO1 and obtained the core gene modules . The top 10 genes included CDC20 , PLK1 , CCNB1 , CCNA2 , CDK1 , KIF2C , KIF23 , BUB1 , BUB1B and MAD2L1 , which were identified as poten - tial hub genes according to the degree score generated by MCODE plug - in of Cytoscape ( marked in yellow ) ( Fig . 9a ) . Meanwhile , according to the degree - rank score generated by CytoHubba plug - in , we got the similar top 10 hub nodes as Fig . 9a ( Fig . 9b ) . Drawing support from STRING database , we further verified the strong corre - lation between FBXO1 and top 10 hub genes obtained from MCODE plug - in ( Fig . 9c ) . In addition , BINGO plug - in showed the most significant biological pro - cess influenced by the hub genes , including cell cycle M phase , organelle fission and nuclear division , which sug - gesting that they probably play crucial roles in the tumor cell mitosis process ( Fig . 9d ) . Hierarchical clustering of the 10 hub genes and FBXO1 was performed by UCSC Xena browser , indicating the consistent expression pro - file among these genes in overall and different subtypes of BC ( Fig . 9e ) . The strong positive correlationship of transcriptional levels among FBXO1 and 10 hub genes in BC patients were also proved by heatmap from the bc - GenExMiner platform ( Fig . 9f ) and scatter diagram from the GEPIA dataset ( Fig . 10a ) . To find more in - depth clinical significance of targeted genes , we investigated the Kaplan – Meier RFS survival curves of 10 hub genes in BC . The results displayed that high expression of total 10 hub genes predicted unfavorable prognosis in patients with BC ( Fig . 10b ) . In conclusion , FBXO1 and CDC20 , PLK1 , CCNB1 , CCNA2 , CDK1 , KIF2C , KIF23 , BUB1 , BUB1B , MAD2L1 may be tightly functional partners in regulating breast tumor cell cycle process and mediating poor prognosis of BC together .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 Discussion Currently , the challenge of early detection and prediction of BC prognosis need to take better approaches . Search - ing of novel tumor - related molecular markers is in full swing . As new cancer biomarkers , FBXO factors dysregu - lation have been reported in many cancers like BC , HCC , gastric cancer , ovarian carcinoma and osteosarcoma . Although several FBXO family members have been confirmed to be related to BC , their distinct molecular mechanism remains to be explored . We found the mRNA expression of 10 FBXO members was remarkable altered and correlated with tumor clinical stage , pathological grade and the prognosis of BC . In this article , we firstly probe into the transcription levels and prognostic val - ues ( RFS , OS , DMFS and PPS ) of 10 FBXO family mem - bers ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 16 , 17 , 22 , 28 , 31 and 45 ) in BC . We hope that our findings will contribute to available knowledge , enhance the accuracy of diagnosis and prognosis for BC patients . FBXO1 has been identified as an expected tumor sup - pressor which can induce G2 phase arrest , impede the initiation of mitosis when it’s overexpressed in cells [ 37 ] . Previous studies have demonstrated that down regu - lation of FBXO1 can accelerate tumor growth , which is related to advanced tumor stage , poor survival rate in hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) [ 38 ] . As far as we know , the function of FBXO1 involved in tumorigenesis and development are not fully elucidated in BC . In our study , we demonstrate that FBXO1 was high - expressed in all subtypes of BC , and similar results were con - firmed by immunohistochemistry . It was an independent poor prognostic factor of RFS , OS and DMFS in BC by Kaplan – Meier Plotter . Besides , targeting FBXO1 may be a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention against hormone receptor - positive types of BC because high expression of FBXO1 means shorter RFS , OS and DMFS in luminal A subtypes . Most importantly , we excavated the top 10 height - correlation oncogene cluster of FBXO1 , which were CDC20 , PLK1 , CCNB1 , CCNA2 , CDK1 , KIF2C , KIF23 , BUB1 , BUB1B and MAD2L1 . They might interact and jointly mediate the development of BC . To explore the interaction mechanism between FBXO1 and these oncogenes in cell cycle is one novel direction in future research work . We speculated that FBXO2 , FBXO6 , FBXO16 and FBXO17 were potential favorable prognostic factors for BC and all of them were correlated to clinicopathologi - cal staging . Previous study literature has indicated that high expression of FBXO2 promotes the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells and which is related to shorter OS of patients . FBXO2 may be a novel clini - cal target for gastric cancer because low FBXO2 expres - sion can increase the mRNA levels of E - cadherin but reduce the expression of N - cadherin in gastric cancer cell . Down - regulating of FBXO2 inhibits the migra - tion of gastric cancer by reducing EMT [ 39 ] . The other study shows FBXO2 is significantly up - regulated in osteosarcoma , which may modulate STAT3 signaling to regulate proliferation and tumorigenicity of osteo - sarcoma cells [ 40 ] . Interestingly , we demonstrated that FBXO2 was down - regulated generally in BC , overexpres - sion of FBXO2 stands for better RFS in Luminal B and HER2 types BRCA , while the expression was correlated with tumor stage in patients with BC . It seemed consist - ent with the role of FBXO2 as a tumor suppressor . It has been proved that low levels of FBXO6 and consequent impairment of replication stress - induced Chk1 degrada - tion are associated with resistance to camptothecin of BC [ 13 ] , the similar results about drug - resistance have been confirmed in small cell lung cancer by Cai et al . [ 41 ] . We also found that up - regulated FBXO6 represented supe - rior RFS in HER2 and TNBC types of patients . It was highly expressed in all subtypes of tumors and closely related to different clinical stages . Thus , FBXO6 may be Fig . 8 The knockdown of FBXO1 attenuates the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro . a Upper panel , the expression levels of FBXO1 protein examined by Western blotting in 8 human breast cell lines .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 an excellent prognostic marker and therapeutic target to overcome the drug - resistance of chemotherapy agents in BC patients . In one sense , FBXO16 is a putative tumor suppressor that suppresses the growth , migration and invasion of cancer cells . It interacts physically with the C - terminal domain of β - catenin and promotes its lysine 48 - linked polyubiquitination and it can inhibit EMT by attenuating the level of β - catenin in BC cells [ 42 ] . This was consistent with our conclusion , the mRNA levels of FBXO16 were especially high in Luminal B subtypes and which was associated with better prognosis . Therefore , FBXO16 may be a putative tumor suppressor . In gen - eral , it has been proved that FBXO17 is overexpressed in many kinds of tumors , like glioma [ 15 ] , HCC [ 43 ] , lung adenocarcinoma [ 16 ] and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ 44 ] . It may affect multiple cellular signal - ing pathways like Wnt / β - catenin [ 43 ] or PI3K - Akt [ 16 ] . Overexpression of FBXO17 is significantly associated with poor prognosis of these cancer patients . The role of FBXO17 in BC has not been elucidated . We put for - ward a new viewpoint of FXBO17 by analyzing tumor databases . FBXO17 was significantly down - regulated in all subtypes of BRCA , and overexpression did not medi - ate the adverse outcomes of BC patients . By contrast , high mRNA expression of FBXO17 indicated better RFS outcomes for BC patients . In our point of view , focus on researching the functions of FBXO17 may promote the advances of molecular mechanism of BC . As for FBXO5 , FBXO22 , FBXO28 , FBXO31 and FBXO45 , they may be the independent poor prognostic factors of BC and the expression levels of which were closely related to different tumor stages . Significant overexpression of FBXO5 has been detected in mixed endometrioid / clear ovarian cell tumors but absent in a b c d e f Fig . 9 Protein – protein Interaction ( PPI ) Network and Correlative Analysis of FBXO1 . a PPI network of FBXO1 and 108 co - expressed genes .

Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 ovarian tumors with mixed serous / clear cell histology [ 45 ] . Besides , FBXO5 has been proved positively cor - related with stage and poor outcome in HCC [ 46 ] . Also , we got the similar results in BC . In luminal A type of BC , overexpression of FBXO5 stands for poor RFS , OS , DMFS and PPS , and poor RFS in luminal B type of patients . The mechanism of action of FBXO5 was related to poor prognosis in BC , which was worthy to make a profound study in the future . Overexpression of FBXO22 has been reported to suppress the Bach1 ‐ driven metas - tasis of lung adenocarcinoma [ 17 ] and promote nuclear tumor suppressive factor PTEN downregulation to play a tumor - promoting role in colorectal cancer [ 47 ] . However , Yoshikazu et al . have showed that low levels of FBXO22 in HER2 - negative BC predict a poorer outcome with high hazard ratios , independently of other markers such as Ki - 67 and lymphnode metastasis status [ 48 ] .

The results based on the KM plotter database indicated that all hub - genes were associated with poor prognosis in BC Page 23 of 25 Liu et al . Cancer Cell Int ( 2021 ) 21 : 130 and low expression of FBXO22 is correlated with worse survival and high HDM2 expression in human BC in Bai’s study [ 49 ] . This is a controversial molecular biomarker . In our report , we found that FBXO22 had high expres - sion levels in all subtypes , especially in HER2 type of BC , which symbolized worse OS in HER2 + patients . High expression level of FBXO28 is associated with worse BC outcomes through non - proteolytic ubiquitination of MYC143 to stimulate cancer cell transcription [ 20 ] . We conjectured FBXO28 was a potential adverse prognostic factor in luminal B and triple - negative of BC by Kaplan – Meier plotter . High - regulation of FBXO31 inhibits the proliferation and colony formation of breast tumor cells by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of specific substrates , and then inhibits cancer progression [ 50 , 51 ] . Nevertheless , we obtained interesting conclusion of FBXO31 . Although it was down - regulated in all subtypes of BC , overexpression of which represented poor prog - nosis in Luminal A , B and HER2 types . Maybe FBXO31 didn’t function as a tumor suppressor , the mechanism of action in BC still need to further explore . Some studies have uncovered that FBXO45 may have important roles in tumorigenesis and progression . The gastric cancer patients with low FBXO45 expression exhibits poorer survival outcomes [ 52 ] . However , the mechanism of FBXO45 in BC remains to explore . There is evidence that FBXO45 mediates ubiquitylation and proteasomal degra - dation of prostate apoptosis response protein 4 , a tumor suppressor protein located in the cytoplasm , to develop a critical role in survival and activity of tumor cells [ 53 ] . In our study , we draw the conclusion that FBXO45 had a high expression levels in all subtypes of BC . It was also highly correlated with tumor patients with different path - ological stages . In luminal A and B types of BC groups , FBXO45 showed poorer RFS and OS clinical outcomes . Thus , FBXO45 leads to poor prognosis and may be a novel therapeutic target for BC treatment . Conclusion In summary , our research work indicates that FBXO2 , FBXO6 , FBXO16 and FBXO17 may be the potential favorable prognostic factors of BC patients . FBXO1 , FBXO5 , FBXO22 , FBXO28 , FBXO31 and FBXO45 are significantly correlated with worse clinical survival out - comes . Based on the above findings , it’s expected that FBXO1 could act as the most promising prognostic bio - marker and therapeutic target for BC . These molecules shed more light on the complexity and heterogeneity of BC biological properties , and further mechanistic studies are needed to validate our findings and to pro - mote clinical application of FBXOs in BC . We hope our research findings could contribute to a better understanding of the pathological mechanism of BC and assist in searching for effective cancer therapeu - tic targets to improve the BC survival and prognostic accuracy .
