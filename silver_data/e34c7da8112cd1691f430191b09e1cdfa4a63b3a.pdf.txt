Early tension regulation coupled to surface myomerger is necessary for the primary fusion of C2C12 myoblasts Madhura Chakraborty , Athul Sivan † , Arikta Biswas † and Bidisha Sinha * Department of Biological Sciences , Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata , Mohanpur , India Here , we study the time - dependent regulation of ﬂ uctuation – tension during myogenesis and the role of the fusogen , myomerger . We measure nanometric height ﬂ uctuations of the basal membrane of C2C12 cells after triggering differentiation . Fusion of cells increases ﬂ uctuation – tension but prefers a transient lowering of tension ( at ~ 2 – 24 h ) . Cells fail to fuse if early tension is continuously enhanced by methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) . Perturbing tension regulation also reduces fusion . During this pre - fusion window , cells that ﬁ nally differentiate usually display lower tension than other non - fusing cells , validating early tension states to be linked to fate decision . Early tension reduction is accompanied by low but gradually increasing level of the surface myomerger . Locally too , regions with higher myomerger intensity display lower tension . However , this negative correlation is lost in the early phase by M β CD - based cholesterol depletion or later as differentiation progresses . We ﬁ nd that with tension and surface - myomerger ’ s enrichment under these conditions , myomerger clusters become pronouncedly diffused . We , therefore , propose that low tension aided by clustered surface - myomerger at the early phase is crucial for fusion and can be disrupted by cholesterol - reducing molecules , implying the potential to affect muscle health . KEYWORDS myoblast fusion , membrane tension , membrane ﬂ uctuations , myomerger , cholesterol Introduction Membrane lateral tension is used by cells to orchestrate diverse biological processes ( Pontes et al . , 2017 ) . Even for membrane fusion , the mechanical state of the membrane is vital , as shown during the repair of lesions and cell – cell fusion ( Demonbreun et al . , 2015 ) . The fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes is also an interesting problem with implications for human health . During the fusion of myoblasts to generate myotubes ( termed myogenesis ) , studies across different model systems ( Rochlin et al . , 2010 ; Abmayr and Pavlath , 2012 ) implicate the regulation of cell mechanics . In insects , the tension of the actomyosin complex ( cortical tension ) is higher in myotubes and aids the fusion process .

Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 01 TYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 14 October 2022 DOI 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 976715 Membrane ﬂ uctuations , inversely proportional to the tension , have been proposed to function as a thermodynamic barrier preventing membrane – membrane interaction and fusion ( Sharma , 2013 ) . Once membranes hemi - fuse , completion of fusion again involves membrane stressing . Recent reports ( Leikina et al . , 2018 ) have demonstrated that arti ﬁ cially stressed or tensed membranes can functionally compensate for the lack of particular fusogens — such as myomerger — during myoblast fusion . Myomerger is one of the two proteins discovered in the last decade in vertebrate systems ( Millay et al . , 2014 ; Millay et al . , 2016 ; Bi et al . , 2017 ; Quinn et al . , 2017 ; Leikina et al . , 2018 ) , playing a critical role in fusion . It is an 84aa single - pass protein , proposed to localize on the plasma membrane . It can generate positive spontaneous membrane curvature ( Golani et al . , 2021 ) and even indirectly stress the membrane , aiding the step from membrane hemi - fusion to complete fusion . Thus , membrane mechanics , especially membrane tension , may be expected to be regulated for successful cell – cell fusion during myogenesis . However , there are no systematic studies on the nature and need of membrane mechanical state during different stages of myogenesis to the best of our knowledge — which this work attempts to address . What complicates the study is that cells display signi ﬁ cant heterogeneity during myogenesis . Most cells retain their mononucleated form after many days of exposure to differentiation culture and co - exist with others that undergo fusion and terminal differentiation . These quiescent cells mimic satellite cells and successfully differentiate when cultured and exposed to differentiation conditions again ( Yoshida et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , we cannot neglect the possibility of different trajectories of membrane mechanics in these two kinds of cells — ones that differentiate and others that fail to differentiate . It is also possible that cells ’ initial membrane mechanical states affect their ability to fuse . Deciphering and untangling the cell types require measurement of the membrane mechanical state in the same live cells as they go through differentiation . Therefore , the role of membrane mechanics , especially membrane ’ s ﬂ uctuation – tension , has been studied focusing on how membrane mechanics evolve , if it in ﬂ uences a cell ’ s fate / ability to differentiate , and how myomerger and tension inter - relate in differentiating cells . In order to investigate this , we employed interference re ﬂ ection microscopy ( IRM ) to measure ﬂ uctuations and derive information about effective membrane mechanical parameters , including membrane ﬂ uctuation – tension . The plasma membrane undergoes incessant shape or height ( from substrate for the basal membrane ) ﬂ uctuations due to the thermal background , and its ﬂ uctuation - amplitude and power - spectra are governed by its mechanical state . Tension derived from membrane ﬂ uctuations — termed ﬂ uctuation – tension — closely follows membrane frame tension and intrinsic membrane tension for a large range of tension values ( Shiba et al . , 2016 ) . For brevity , membrane ﬂ uctuation – tension has been referred to as “ tension ” in the rest of the manuscript . In this study , we assayed randomly selected cells in a population as well as followed single live cells for days after administrating the differentiation media ( DM ) . To track the same cells for 5 days of differentiation , we used micropatterning to start with an aligned system and used marked dishes to ﬁ nd back the same regions on the different timepoints ( days ) of differentiation . Membrane mechanics were measured by IRM , while the surface level of myomerger was assayed in ﬁ xed samples via immuno ﬂ uorescence ( IF ) and total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( TIRF ) . When performed in tandem , IRM and wide ﬁ eld IF allowed correlative measurements of mechanics and ﬂ uorescence at the local scale and across cells . Together , this study provides new information about the alterations and coupling of tension and surface myomerger in cells undergoing cell – cell fusion in myogenesis . Results IRM imaging of differentiating C2C12 cells To measure the modulations of membrane mechanics during differentiation , C2C12 cells were imaged at various timepoints after administration of DM ( Figure 1A , Supplementary Figure S1 ) . As a control set , cells were imaged at 2 h post DM addition , ensuring maintaining the same refractive index of media for all timepoints — for better comparison of IRM . It is to be noted that it is known that no appreciable change in the gene expression pro ﬁ le starts by 2 h ( Yoshida et al . , 1998 ) . New fusion events were observed to start from 48 – 96 h post DM , as expected . Hence , dishes were followed until the 96 h timepoint . At 96 h , cells having more than one nucleus — evident from DIC images of live cells — were noted as differentiated [ 96 hr ( D ) ] . Since cells were expected to commit to differentiation by 96 h , unfused cells at 96 h were termed as undifferentiated [ 96 hr ( U ) ] . Anti MyHC antibody staining ( MF20 ) , a known differentiation marker ( Choi et al . , 2020 ) , was used to con ﬁ rm differentiation and further validated that the multinucleated state and differentiation were correlated ( Figure 1B ) . At 96 h , the mean MyHC intensity in differentiated cells is aproximately six times more than that of the undifferentiated cells ( Figures 1C , D ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . The fusion index at 96 h was ~ 30 – 50 % whether the substrate was kept on a glass coverslip or PEG - coated glass micropatterned with adhesive line - shaped ( 20 - μ m wide and spaced 15 μ m apart ) patterns ( Supplementary Figures S2A – E ) . Differentiated cells also showed a thicker cortical actin layer ( Supplementary Figures S2F , G ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . IRM images ( Figures 1A , B ) showed clear membrane topology alterations in differentiated cells . It should be noted that the intensity of IRM images indicates the relative distance Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 02 Chakraborty et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 976715 FIGURE 1 IRM and ﬂ uorescence images of C2C12 cells during differentiation .

Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 03 Chakraborty et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 976715 between the basal membrane and the coverslip . The low intensity or dark regions arise due to this distance being minimized at focal adhesions or close attachment with the substrate . As the distance increases , the intensity increases until the ﬁ rst ~ 100 nm — after which the intensity – height dependence reverses ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . After differentiation , cells showed very uniform but darker intensities interspersed with lighter regions — unlike undifferentiated cells at 96 h or earlier timepoints . To the best of our knowledge , this work is the ﬁ rst report of IRM images of myogenesis . To understand if there were any robust patterns in these observations and if they indicated particular changes in membrane mechanics , next , the membrane height ﬂ uctuations were compared . Differentiation increases ﬂ uctuation – tension The membrane height ﬂ uctuations were calculated from the intensity changes by applying intensity – height conversion to pixels that were within ~ 100 nm of the coverslip , falling in the ﬁ rst branch of the intensity – height calibration ( Supplementary Figure S1D ) ( Biswas et al . , 2017 ) . These regions were termed as the ﬁ rst branch regions ( FBRs ) ( yellow boxes , Figure 2A ) . FBRs were further ﬁ ltered by avoiding the inclusion of pixels whose ﬂ uctuations were either very reduced ( for example , at focal adhesions ) or very high ( usually in the cell interior ) in the course of the complete time series ( ~ 103 s ) . Multiple square regions were , thereby , identi ﬁ ed where the intensity could be compared temporally or spatially to quantify height ﬂ uctuations . There can be appreciable variability of membrane mechanics within single cells ( Shi et al . , 2018 ; Biswas et al . , 2019 ) . To capture local - level alterations in differentiation , FBRs from all cells of a particular condition were pooled and compared with other such pools ( termed “ FBR - wise ” , Figure 2 ) . The linear mixed - effect model ( using the ﬁ xed effect of time and random effects grouped under replicate set - number of the experiments and cell number ) was utilized to avoid the effect of the high sample size of FBRs in ﬂ uencing the hypothesis testing as also practiced for other high - sampling mechanical measurements ( Herbig et al . , 2018 ; Reichel et al . , 2022 ) . FBR - wise comparisons revealed how the distribution of local ﬂ uctuations / tension was affected by differentiation . To understand if there were global changes , cell - averaged quantities were pooled and compared ( “ cell - wise ” , Figure 2 ) . Analysis of the ﬂ uctuations ( Figures 2B – D ) showed that for differentiated [ 96 hr ( D ) ] cells , cell averages of temporal height ﬂ uctuations ( SD time ) and spatial undulations ( SD space ) were lower than those of the control ( 2 h ) set or the cells which failed to differentiate [ 96h ( U ) ] ( Figure 2E ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . The reduction in the amplitude of spatial undulations found from comparing the height ﬁ eld across pixels in single FBRs of snapshots ( SD space ) ( Figure 2F ) corroborated the impression of a ﬂ atter membrane implicated by the uniform dark appearance of differentiated cells in IRM . Exponents calculated from the power spectral density ( PSD ) ( Figure 2D ) implied that cell membranes of differentiated cells were most “ con ﬁ ned ” ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) ( Brochard et al . , 1975 ) . Higher con ﬁ nement and enhanced effective viscosity of the surrounding media were also re ﬂ ected in the ﬁ t parameters obtained from ﬁ tting the PSD ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) with the theoretical model . The local tension distribution displayed a signi ﬁ cant increase in the median on differentiation . However , cells that fail to differentiate in the same plates do not have such tension changes ( Figure 2G ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . Although differentiated cells have signi ﬁ cantly higher tension than cells at 2 h post DM addition and their cell - averaged tension was ~ 10 . 5 % more than 96 hr ( U ) , the difference from the undifferentiated lot was statistically non - signi ﬁ cant at the whole - cell level . We next visualize the distribution of tension in cells using tension maps ( Biswas et al . , 2019 ) and also check if local heterogeneities are enhanced for the observed increase in tension on differentiation . Spatial heterogeneity of ﬂ uctuation – tension increases with the mean The local tension pro ﬁ le is best assayed by measuring the tension at each pixel and visualizing it as a map ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure S4 ) . However , since it included pixels that were not FBRs , it must be noted that the map is mainly for visually assessing the spatial tension distribution . We , therefore , corroborated this data with measurement of the intracellular variation of ﬂ uctuations ( SD ( SD time ) and SD ( SD space ) — Figures 3B , C ; Supplementary Table S1 ) and tension ( SD tension — Figure 3D ; Supplementary Table S1 ) measured using FBRs . Maps indicated that at 2 h post administration of DM , tension is high at the cell periphery . A typical image of differentiated ( D ) cells in close contact with an undifferentiated ( U ) cell ( Figure 3A third row ) showed higher tension than the undifferentiated , with edges more adhered and higher in tension . At 96 h , cells revealed higher variability in tension ( Figure 3D , Supplementary Figure S4 ) , but intracellular variability in spatial local undulations and temporal ﬂ uctuation are either unchanged or reduced . On differentiation , mean tension increased , while the mean of ﬂ uctuation amplitude ( SD ) decreased . To remove the effect of the changing mean , we plotted the mean - normalized standard deviation , SD , using SD / ( mean of SD ) ( Figure3E ) and carried outthe same for tension ( Figure 3F ) . The normalized variation increased for SD space , whereas for tension , no change was observed . Together , this implied that the enhanced variation of tension from region to region is connected to the increase in mean tension and slightly enhanced intrinsic variability of ﬂ uctuations . Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 04 Chakraborty et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 976715 Thus , differentiation is demonstrated to affect overall tension and the intracellular variation of membrane ﬂ uctuations in cells . To understand how tension might be important in deciding cell fate , we next follow the same cells through differentiation . Tension trajectories of single cells are connected to their ﬁ nal differentiation state Cells were plated on line - shaped micropatterns ( Pontes et al . , 2017 ; Kumar et al . , 2019 ) that were 20 μ m wide , interspersed with 15 - μ m - wide low - adhesive , PEG - coated regions . This controlled their initial orientation and lateral spacing , although we also observed heterogeneities and cell growth crossing over patterns . Cells were tracked through 4 days of treatment with DM at 2 , 24 , 48 , 72 , and 96 h . They were taken out from the incubator for imaging — only for 30 – 60 min per day , thus minimizing physiological stress . To ﬁ nd back the same coordinates on the dish each day , the dishes were marked with two reference points whose coordinates were noted . Comparing old and new coordinates of reference points helped in the calculation of transformations necessary ( rotation / translation ) to ﬁ nd previously imaged regions . Using beads of diameter 2 μ m , we estimated an error of 19 ± 10 μ m in the prediction of coordinates ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . During experiments , this resolution together with reference regions ( Figures 4A , B arrows , Supplementary Figure S5C ) was usually enough to locate back cells . Figure 4 shows two typical cells ( Figures 4A , B ) where the same cell was ﬁ rst imaged at ﬁ ve different timepoints ( 2 h – 96 h ) . The multinucleated state ( clear from DIC images ) and distinctive IRM pattern ( Figure 1B ) were used to demarcate differentiated from undifferentiated cells during live experiments . However , further validation was also performed in multiple typical experiments by following live cell IRM measurements with cell ﬁ xation and subsequently staining cells with MyHC antibody ( MF20 ) at 120 h ( last image , Figures 4A , B ) . Cells identi ﬁ ed as differentiated ( by IRM morphology and multinucleated state seen in DIC ) showed signi ﬁ cantly higher intensity ( Figure 4A , last image ) than the ones identi ﬁ ed to be undifferentiated . ( Figure 4B , last image ) . Typical tension trajectories for these cells are shown in Figures 4C , D ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . On pooling all cells irrespective of their differentiation status , we found that tension showed a slow reduction that was recovered back ( Figure 5A ) . To understand the relative tension change experienced by single cells , each cell ’ s SD time or tension at 2 h was used to normalize its tension measured at other timepoints ( Figures 5B , C ; Supplementary Table S1 ) . Cells that ﬁ nally differentiate ( FD ) were found to be more prone to having a temporary increase in ﬂ uctuations ( Figure 5B ) or decrease in tension ( Figure 5C ) at 24 h than cells that remained ﬁ nally undifferentiated ( FU ) till 96 h . The transient increase in SD time ( Figure 5B ) was found to be a signi ﬁ cant parameter demarcating trajectories of FD and FU cells . The decrease FIGURE 3 Mapping ﬂ uctuation tension to reveal the intracellular heterogeneities .

We term them as “ dips ” and ﬁ nd for each set how the percentage of cells with dips couple to the fusion ef ﬁ ciency ( number of cells that fuse / total cells observed ) ( Figure 5D left ) . Were cells with dips more prone to a particular fate ? We did not ﬁ nd compelling evidence , but the data ( Figure 5D center , right ) suggested that among cells with dips , a higher percentage fused , whereas among cells without dips , a higher percentage remained single . However , mean tension arranged with respect to the day of fusion ( D ) showed no particular pre - tension drop ( Figure 5E ) . When the mean tension of FD cells was compared to that of FU cells , the ratio was found to be initially lower than 1 followed by an increase ( Figure 5F ) . Before further exploring this , we demonstrated the effect of increasing tension externally by continuous cholesterol depletion using M β CD ( Zidovetzki and Levitan , 2007 ) . A milder concentration ( 2 mM ) waschosenatwhich thecellular morphology , spreading , and packing remain unaffected ( Figure 5G top panel ) . We found that at this concentration , M β CD increased tension and cells completely failed to fuse even after 5 days of exposure to differentiation media ( Figure 5G ; bottom panel ) . Was it due to disturbed tension drop or tension regulation or caused by other effects of cholesterol depletion ? Althoughwehopetoaddressthoseinthefuture , itmustbenotedthat the cell – cell distances were not affected by this treatment . To further evaluate the role of tension , we next studied the effect of a well - known tension - regulating endocytotic pathway , CG pathway , by ML141 , a known inhibitor of CDC42 GTPase ( Thottacherry et al . , 2018 ) . We observed a signi ﬁ cantly reduced fusion index ( Figure 5G ) , whereas our research showed that ML141 action increased the tension of C2C12 cells ( Supplementary Figure S6E ) . We , thus , showed that overall tension regulation is essential for fusion . However , at the single - cell level , does tension control its ability to fuse ? We compared the tension measured in cells much before the cells ﬁ nally fuse ( FD ) or fail to fuse ( FU ) and found that at the 2 - h timepoint , cells that ﬁ nally fuse had smaller median tension than cells that fail to fuse ; however , the differences were statistically not signi ﬁ cant when also checked using LMM ( Figure 5H , Supplementary Figure S6 ) . At 24 h , the 2 - hr trend was found to be reinforced for tension , making the change FIGURE 4 Tracking particular cells through the differentiation period .

SD time also showed softening at 24 h ( Figure 5H left ) . A reversal occurred post 48 h when FD cells were more tensed with lesser ﬂ uctuations — probably due to progress into differentiation . However , the hypothesis that a tension dip is required for successful fusion later would predict a decrease of the FD / FU tension ratio from 2h to 24 h , having different tensions to start with , which would obscure the predicted effect . An early role of regulation of ﬂ uctuations and tension in determining cell fate was , hence , implicated by these ﬁ ndings . Since myomerger has been ascribed the role of stressing hemi - fused membrane , we next explored its interplay with tension at the population level and its coupling to tension in single cells at different phases of differentiation . We ﬁ rst quantify changes in the surface level of myomerger with the progress of differentiation . Distribution of surface myomerger While myomerger abundance is known to be increased with progress in differentiation ( Bi et al . , 2017 ) , to understand its surface levels and coupling to membrane ﬂ uctuations and tension , we use immuno ﬂ uorescence combined with TIRF FIGURE 5 Comparing membrane ﬂ uctuation andtension between cellsofdifferent ﬁ nalfates .

Cells in growth media ( GM ) have an appreciable level of the surface myomerger , which ﬁ rst could reduce ( Figures 6A – C ; Supplementary Table S1 ) and then increase . The cell – cell variability in myomerger levels also increased drastically with time ( Figure 6D ) . We also found sample - to - sample variability in the timing of the initial decrease . Different experiment sets show the transient decrease at either 2 h or 24 h . However , when data from four different sets are collated relative to the day myotube formation starts in the sample ( D ) , the increase was found to start 48 h before D in the dish ( Figure 6E , Supplementary Figure S7B ) . Even within myotubes , the variability was high , and variation with time was observed ( Figures 6C – E ) . It should be noted that the presence of surface myomerger in cells in GM could be substantiated . First , it was found to be more than the non - speci ﬁ c binding of secondary antibodies ( Supplementary Figures S7D , E ) . Next , it could be also measured by checking protein abundance by Western blotting ( Supplementary Figure S7F ) . The fact that Western blot shows a much higher change in myomerger levels at 24 h ( in comparison to GM ) while changes are less pronounced for surface levels could be because the myomerger is known to be regulated strictly at the membrane , irrespective of its whole cell expression / overexpression status ( Golani et al . , 2021 ) . Having established that myomerger shows modulations in its surface levels , in the next part , we check if tension alterations and myomerger alterations are coupled . Myomerger expression and its correlation with the spatial tension pro ﬁ le The correlation of local myomerger intensity at the cell surface with its membrane mechanical properties was explored by performing in tandem , live - cell , ﬁ xed - cell IRM , and myomerger immuno ﬂ uorescence ( Figure 7A ) . A delay of ~ 15 – 25 min with respect to the IRM should be noted . Despite the delay , while local trends were expected to change in this timescale , the overall cell intensity , known to change slowly ( Figure 6 ) , was expected to remain similar .

Parallel checks with the same samples imaged in TIRF and epi ﬂ uorescence ( epi ) showed that the trend observed in TIRF was also replicated in epi ﬂ uorescence ( Supplementary Figure S7B ) . At early timepoints , cell averages of myomerger intensity increased from 2 to 24 h , while the tension in this pool decreased ( Figure 7B , top panel , Supplementary Table S1 ) . The membrane con ﬁ nement parameter and effective cytoplasmic viscosity also decreased ( Supplementary Figure S8A ) . At later timepoints , intensity increases from 48 to 72 h , but in myotubes , the increase was not appreciable .

The correlation turned positive at later timepoints and for myotubes ( all higher intensities ) ( Figure 7C , bottom ) . It is , thus , clear that the overall myomerger intensity has a biphasic relationship with cell tension . To address if such a coupling exists at a local length scale , we aligned images to make the best possible matches of the live and ﬁ xed - IRM images and used common regions ( between myomerger ﬂ uorescence and FBRs of live IRM ) that were 24 × 24 pixels or 1 . 73 µm × 1 . 73 µm wide ( Figure 7D images ) . Typical data ( from particular cell sections ) of measured tension in each region vs . the measured mean intensity at the same FBR could display a non - signi ﬁ cant correlation ( Figure 7E , lower row ) or a negative correlation ( Figure 7E , upper row ) . Like tension , SD time and SD space also showed a signi ﬁ cant correlation ( positive for most early cells , Supplementary Figure S8B ) . On collating cell sections from three sets , ~ 40 % of samples of early timepoints showed a negative correlation that reduced drastically at later timepoints ( Figure 7F ) . Hence , we found the negative correlation to be prominent at early timepoints even on comparing single - cell intracellular regions — strongly indicating that myomerger locally reduces tension . The positive correlation of cellular myomerger was not locally evident within the ~ 1 . 73 - µm length scale . We next quanti ﬁ ed how myomerger ’ s intensity distribution changed as its correlation with tension was lost — either at later timepoints and myotubes or by cholesterol depletion at early timepoints . We checked if there were any common features . Diffused myomerger distribution in myotubes and cholesterol depletion Immuno ﬂ uorescence ( IF ) images taken in epi ﬂ uorescence ( followed by IRM ) helped visualize a punctate distribution at 2 h and 24 h that drastically affected by cholesterol depletion ( Figure 8A ) . The mean intensity increased on cholesterol depletion , while tension also increased — an effect more pronounced for cells at 2 h than 24 h post - trigger ( Figure 8B ) . Although a perfect matching between ﬂ uorescence and tension is not possible , we next tried to visualize the correlation ( and its loss ) inside ~ 8 × 8 μ m 2 regions ( Figure 8C ) . We observed a lower myomerger intensity in regions where the tension was locally high ( white outlines , Figure 8C ) . However , it should be noted that after cholesterol depletion , the diffused ﬂ uorescence was hardly anti - correlated with any tension heterogeneity ( Figure 8C ) . The percentage of cells with negative correlation reduced on M β CD treatment at 2 h but are not found at all at 24 - h ’ s cholesterol depletion ( Figure 8D ) . The strength of the correlation coef ﬁ cient was also reduced ( Supplementary Figure S9 ) . On the one hand , this implied increasing tension does not decrease myomerger intensity , and on the other hand , the punctated nature of the myomerger is suggested to be important for the negative correlation . Were punctas or clusters really lowered on cholesterol depletion ? And , did it also happen when at later timepoints , the negative correlation is lost ? We detected the clusters by object detection in MATLAB and found the ratio of mean intensity in clusters to that of the diffused background ( Figure 8E ) . We ﬁ rst showed that the ratio decreased as cells remained in differentiation media for a long time ( Figures 8F , G ) and the number of clusters decreased ( Figure 8H ) . Analysis of the zoomed - in view of myomerger IF ( Figure 8I ) showed that the ratio and number of punctas per unit area also reduced on cholesterol depletion ( Figure 8J ) . Thus , the negative correlation was strongly dependent on the myomerger ’ s presence as clear punctas / clusters . Discussion In this study , the use of IRM enabled a non - invasive measurement of membrane mechanics of the differentiating C2C12 cells even at higher cell densities . Although IRM limits measurements to the basal membrane , which does not take part in the fusion process , it helped in recording the global mechanical changes triggered by differentiation . We found that cell – cell fusion resulted in enhanced cell surface tension ( Figures 2G , 5C ) , which is in line with higher cortical tension reported in insect myotubes ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . We , too , observed that myotubes had a thicker actomyosin cortex ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) , and a higher effective viscosity ( η eff , Supplementary Figure S3D ) is experienced by the membrane while ﬂ uctuating . We also showed here that myotubes [ 96 h ( D ) , Figure 5C ] have higher ﬂ uctuation – tension than the cells they originate from , unlike mono - nucleated cells at the same timepoint [ 96 h ( U ) , Figure 5C ] . While the effect of differentiation on tension was thereby clear , the role of tension in cell fate determination during fusion could be derived mainly from single - cell tracking experiments . Stochasticity in cell fate determination has been observed in many systems ( Johnston and Desplan , 2010 ) , including cell – cell fusion ( Capkovic et al . , 2008 ; Trapnell et al . , 2014 ; Arnold et al . , 2020 ) . Cells that fail to fuse in a given time window , however , have been shown to retain fusion potential ( when triggered again afresh ) ( Yoshida et al . , 1998 ) . Despite cell - to - cell variability , our measurements indicate that cells that reduce tension upon being triggered are more probable to ﬁ nally differentiate ( FD , Figure 5 ) . A higher percentage of FD cells ( than FU cells ) were found to have displayed a dipping tension at 2 h or 24 h post DM . Why the dip is needed is unclear , but the functional signi ﬁ cance of early tension regulation is further supported by the observation of loss of fusion by enhancing tension throughout using cholesterol depletion ( by M β CD ) . Past studies by other groups administering M β CD in shorter time windows at later timepoints ( 24 h and beyond and followed by washes ) do not report such loss of fusion ( Mermelstein et al . , 2004 ) . Our checks under such conditions also show no loss of fusion when M β CD was washed away after 30 min ( Supplementary Figure S10 ) . Hence , we establish the role of continuous tension regulation in the early phase . Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin . org 11 Chakraborty et al . 10 . 3389 / fphys . 2022 . 976715 At this point , a potential direct role of cholesterol in fusion or its effectbydisrupting caveolae ( Dewulfetal . , 2019 ) cannotberuledout . However , studies on caveolae - forming CAV3 have reported con ﬂ icting roles . CAV3 can both help in disrupting the fusion of myoblasts ( Volonte et al . , 2003 ) and aiding fusion ( Galbiati et al . , 1999 ; Stoppani et al . , 2011 ) . Our observation of fusion - defect using ML141 , and its tension - enhancing effect on C2C12 ( Supplementary Figure S6E ) , further establishes the central role of tension regulation . The role of the myomerger that we propose in this early regulation is new . Myomerger has been shown to be important only after hemi - fusion . However , our data capture myomerger ’ s biphasic , concentration - dependent correlation with tension , suggesting a strong connection between its surface levels and the earlystagesofdifferentiation . Despitereportsofamonotonicincrease in the myomerger ’ s protein abundance ( comparing Western blots using the same protein mass ) with the progress of differentiation ( Bi et al . , 2017 ) , we must note that studies have also shown independent regulation of surface levels ( Golani et al . , 2021 ) . The increasing phase of myomerger starting ~ 48 h before fusion ( Figure 6E ) was the most robust and relevant observation . In this phase , a substantial negative correlation of myomerger intensity and tension was observed at multiple levels , implying strongly an early role of the myomerger . At andbeyond 24h , thecorrelationofhigherintensitiesatlower - tension regions was visually clear from cell averages ( Figures 7A – C ) , within single cells ( Figures 7D – F ) , and inside ~ 8 μ m × 8 μ m regions ( Figure 8C ) . The interaction of the ectopic domain of the protein with the membrane ( mimicking protein adsorption ) and inducing a positive spontaneous curvature could be responsible . Protein adsorption captured as a difference in spontaneous curvature under the protein patch and the surrounding has been implicated to result in local and overall tension decrease ( Rangamani et al . , 2014 ) . Our observation of the strongest correlation and the highest cluster - to - diffused - background ratio of the myomerger at 2 h ( Figures 8G , J ) supports the possibility . On cholesterol depletion , the myomerger surface levels enhanced — without substantial change in whole cell myomerger levels ( Supplementary Figures S9D , E ) — the ratio decreased while the negative correlation was also lost / reduced . Such an early loss of negative correlation ( by M β CD ) was observed to be detrimental for fusion . High myomerger levels before the onset of hemi - fusion have been reported to reduce fusion ( Golani et al . , 2021 ) . At ≥ 48 h , myomerger ’ s surface level increased and its cell averages correlated positively to tension , but only a very small percentage of region - wise correlations actually was signi ﬁ cantly positive ( Figure 7F ) . Although unclear at this stage , it is in line with its indirect effect in stressing distal membranes through its induction of positive curvature on proximal membranes ( Golani et al . , 2021 ) . As limitations , we cannot negate the fact that these are clusters of immuno ﬂ uorescence ( IF ) . Although they re ﬂ ect a local increase in protein density , the effect of the antibody ’ s interaction in their formation warrants consideration . However , since the clustering was coupled to the tension measured at the live state , we believe the changes in distribution ( clustered to diffused ) were faithfully captured by IF . We also note that myomaker ’ s role in tension regulation should be addressed since it is critical for hemi - fusion . However , its intracellular C - terminal region , which has been shown to be necessary for fusion ( Millay et al . , 2016 ) , implicates a signaling - based role more than its function as a tension regulator . In summary , we show early tension lowering is critical for C2C12 differentiation and myomerger plays an active role in this , possibly by its ability to induce local positive curvature . M β CD - based cholesterol depletion obstructs this by reducing local contrast in myomerger ’ s concentration , enhancing surface and decreasing its tension - reducing ability — thereby suppressing fusion . M β CD ’ s use in therapeutics makes these observations relevant for future investigations on its effect on muscle health since the fusion of satellite cells to existing myo ﬁ bers may involve similar tension regulation requirements .

Micropattern protocol Etched glass coverslips ( 1 : 19 acetic acid and ethanol solution ) were used ; ﬁ rst , we cleaned it using a UV / – Ozone ( UVO ) cleaner ( Jelight Company , United States ) for 5 min . Cleaned coverslips were incubated with 0 . 2 mg / ml PLL - g _ PEG ( SuSos , Switzerland ) for 2 h . A cleaned photomask ( JD Photo Data , UK ) was used to pattern on PEG - coated coverslips . The line - 2 ( width : 20 μ m ; length : no constraint ; and spacing : 15 µm spacing ) pattern was used . The coated coverslips were placed on top of the pattern of interest on the photomask and a small drop of water was sandwiched in between . Patterning was carried out inside a UVO cleaner for 5 min . Patterned coverslips were removed from the photomask by ﬂ oating them off with water . Cells were seeded on the patterned side ( Kumar et al . , 2019 ) . Interference re ﬂ ection microscopy For interference re ﬂ ection microscopy ( IRM ) , we used an Eclipse Ti - Emotorizedinvertedmicroscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) equipped with adjustable ﬁ eld and aperture diaphragms , 60x Plan Apo ( NA 1 . 22 , water immersion ) with ×1 . 5 external magni ﬁ cation . The EMCCD camera ( Evolve 512 Delta , Photometrics , United States ) and CMOS ( ORCA Flash 4 . 0 Hamamatsu , Japan ) camera were used for IRM , epi ﬂ uorescence , and DIC modes of imaging . A 100 - W mercury arc lamp and a 546 ± 12 nm interference ﬁ lter with a 50 : 50 beam splitter were additional requirements for IRM mode . All cells were imaged in 3 ml of DM , and calibration was carried out using 60 µm diameter polystyrene NIST beads ( Bangs Laboratories Inc . ) . Fast time - lapse images of cells were taken at 20 frames per second ( 50 ms interval ) in the CMOS camera or 19 . 91 frames per second in the EMCCD camera . In total , 2048 frames were captured for IRM analysis . Total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy and epi ﬂ uorescence microscopy For TIRF , an Olympus IX - 83 inverted microscope ( Olympus , Meliville , NY ) equipped with a 100 × 1 . 49 NA oil immersion TIRF objective ( PlanApo , Olympus ) was used . Images were acquired using a CMOS camera ( ORCA Flash 4 . 0 Hamamatsu , Japan ) . A 488 - nm laser beam was used as a laser source for TIRF . All images were taken at 200 ms exposure time and ~ 100 nm penetration depth . For epi ﬂ uorescence , a mercury arc lamp was used , and images were taken using FITC and DAPI ﬁ lters with ×60 and ×100 objectives . All images were taken at 200 ms of exposure time . Quanti ﬁ cation and statistical analysis Measuring the fusion index MF20 - and DAPI - labeled myotubes were considered for fusion index calculations . The fusion index was calculated by counting the number of nuclei in a single myotube divided by the total number of nuclei in the same frame , multiplied by 100 for obtaining the percentage . Intensity measurement for checking the MF20 level For measuring intensity , 24 × 24 pixel rectangular regions were selected from each MF20 - labeled cell . Mean intensity from all the ROIs is then selected cell - wise to compare . Analysis of membrane height ﬂ uctuations This involves , ﬁ rst , a careful calibration of the height – intensity relationship using 60 - μ m beads for a range of net intensities . Minimum and maximum intensities observed in single cells were then used to select the corresponding calibration curve from the bead data . Next , images of cells were scrutinized pixel by pixel using MATLAB to eliminate pixels that do not lie in the ﬁ rst branch of the intensity – height relationship ( within ~ 100 nm of the coverslip ) . This step was performed because the monotonously increasing relation between IRM intensity and membrane height ( from coverslip ) exists only for the ﬁ rst branch region . Once relevant pixels were identi ﬁ ed , different 12 × 12 pixel regions ( unless otherwise indicated ) corresponding to 2 . 16 µm × 2 . 16 µm ( or as indicated in ﬁ gures ) were marked out and used to build single - cell statistics . The amplitude of membrane height ﬂ uctuations is quanti ﬁ ed by the standard deviation ( SD ) calculated from the height time series of single pixels and then averaged over single FBRs . This parameter is termed SD time . The amplitude of spatial undulations was quanti ﬁ ed by measuring the SD — but over 12 × 12 pixel regions of single - time - pointimages . Theaverageofthisover20framesisusedastheSD space . To understand the underlying mechanical state , the frequency distribution of the height ﬂ uctuations was calculated in the form of the power spectral density ( PSD ) . The PSD was used to calculate from height time - series of every pixel of FBRs either by using the FFT - based method ( Biswas et al . , 2017 ; Biswas et al . , 2019 ) or the covariance method ( autoregressive PSD estimation ) ( MATLAB ) . “ Exponent ” captures the state of con ﬁ nement from the power relationship between PSD and frequency in the linear part of the PSD ( frequency ranging from 0 Hz to 10 Hz ) .

The bending rigidity ( κ ) was ﬁ xed at 15 k B T . Due to the increasing heterogeneity in the biochemical nature of cells in a population , calibrations were speci ﬁ c to every single cell . For creating tension maps , PSD was calculated for every pixel before ﬁ tting and extracting parameters . Measuring myomerger intensity and cluster detection Freehand region of interest ( ROI ) drawn from myomerger - labeled cells at different timepoints was used to get mean intensity for surface myomerger estimation . For ﬁ nding a region - wise correlation , the merging of live IRM and ﬁ xed ﬂ uorescence images of the same cell was necessary and performed by using the ImageJ ( FIJI ) template matching plugin . 24 × 24 pixels ( 1 . 72 × 1 . 72 µm 2 ) FBR regions were chosen for measuring tension , and the same regions were then merged on the ﬂ uorescence sample to measure the mean intensity from a particular FBR . The probability density estimate of mean myomerger intensity per cell was plotted using the ksdensity function of MATLAB . For detecting myomerger “ clusters ” from IF images , local thresholding was carried out ﬁ rst , followed by object detection using MATLAB . The mask of detected objects in multiple rectangular ROIs was used to identify pixels in the original image , andthemeanintensitywasnoted asthemeanintensityoftheclusters of that region . The remaining pixels in the ROI were used to calculate the mean of the diffused background . ROIs were always chosen in regions inside the cell .
