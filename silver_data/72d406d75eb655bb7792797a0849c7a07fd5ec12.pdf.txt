Introduction The actin cytoskeleton is a dynamic ﬁlament network essen - tial for cell movement , morphogenesis , polarization and cell division ( Drubin and Nelson , 1996 ; Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ) . These processes rely on the rapid and localized assem - bly and disassembly of actin ﬁlaments . Cellular signals , such as the activated Rho - family G proteins , direct construction of new actin ﬁlaments de novo by localizing and activating the nucle - ation machinery . The seven - protein Arp2 / 3 complex is one of the prime candidates that can generate new barbed ends by stim - ulating nucleation ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) . Two actin - related proteins ( Arp2 and Arp3 ) of the complex serve as the nucle - ation site for a ﬁlament with a free barbed end ( Robinson et al . , 2001 ) . Except for cortactin , CARMIL , myosin I , etc . , most of nucleation - promoting factors identiﬁed to date are members of the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) family , which ∗ Corresponding author .

These proteins contain a number of domains known to interact with both the cytoskeleton and various signaling complexes that regulate cell and pathogen movements ( Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . A number of unrelated intracellular pathogens such as Liste - ria monocytogenes , Shigella spp . , Rickettsia spp . and vaccinia virus have developed strategies to manipulate the cytoskele - tal machinery to invade , move within and spread between host cells ( Goldberg , 2001 ) . These strategies combine structural and functional mimicry of host proteins and activities . It has been demonstrated that ﬁlamentous actin is essen - tial for nucleocapsid morphogenesis and progeny production of Autographa californica multi nucleopolyhedrovirus ( AcM - NPV ) and others in the Nucleopolyhedrovirus genus ( Kasman and Volkman , 2000 ) . It is also shown that nucleocapsids of AcM - NPV are capable of nucleating actin polymerization in vitro and that the structural protein P78 / 83 locate at the basal end of the nucleocapsid binds directly to actin ( Lanier and Volkman , 1998 ; Russell et al . , 1997 ) . P78 / 83 shares proline - rich WH2 and acidic motifs with mammalian WASP family ( Machesky 0168 - 1702 / $ – see front matter © 2007 Elsevier B . V .

( 2006 ) demonstrated that P78 / 83 was a viral nucleation - promoting fac - tor for the Arp2 / 3 complex and nuclear actin assembly by P78 / 83 and Arp2 / 3 complex was essential for viral progeny produc - tion . The open reading frame ha2 of the Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus ( HearNPV ) , a homologue of P78 / 83 , was shown to interact with host cell actin ( Chen et al . , 2001 ; Nie et al . , 2006 ) . In this paper , we demonstrate that HearNPV nucleo - capsids induce actin polymerization in vitro , and demonstrate the mechanism of actin nucleation induced by HA2 and the interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Cells and viruses The H . zea cell line ( BCIRL - Hz - AM1 , Hz - AM1 ) and Spodoptera frugiperda ( Sf9 ) cells were maintained at 28 ◦ C in Grace’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . HearNPV G4 , the genome of which has been entirely sequenced ( Chen et al . , 2001 ) , and vHa - Ha2 - egfp ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) was propagated in Hz - AM1 cells . An AcMNPV bacmid ( bMON14272 ; Invitrogen ) was also used . 2 . 2 . Puriﬁcation of budded virus ( BV ) and solubilized BV ( sBV ) Medium from infected cells was clariﬁed by low - speed cen - trifugation and BV was then pelleted using a 25 % sucrose cushion at 100 , 000 × g for 45 min . The virus pellet was resus - pended in 10 mM Tris , pH 8 . 5 , and an aliquot was removed for protein analysis using BCA reagent ( Beyotime ) . Aliquots of BV ( 100 (cid:1) g ) were solubilized with 1 % Nonidet P - 40 to prepare sBV ( Lanier and Volkman , 1998 ) . 2 . 3 . Protein expression and puriﬁcation Full - length HA2 was expressed in Sf9 cells using the Bac - to - Bac baculovirus expression system ( Gibco BRL ) with an N - terminal 6 × His - tag . To obtain the recombinant virus , the entire ha2 gene was cloned into the vector pFactbacHTb uti - lizing the Eco RV and Xba I sites to produce the donor plasmid pFactHTb - His - ha2 . This plasmid was used to transform com - petent DH10B cells containing helper and AcMNPV bacmid ( Invitrogen ) . The recombinant bacmid was used to transfect Sf9 cellswiththeaidoflipofectin ( Invitrogen ) togeneratetherecom - binant virus , vAc - His - Ha2 . Sf9 cells infected with vAc - His - Ha2 were lysed and clariﬁed , and the protein was puriﬁed on afﬁnity columns containing Ni - NTA resin ( Novagen ) . The puriﬁed Ha2 was run on SDS - PAGE to detect its size and gel was stained with Commassie Blue . Western blot analysis was performed using the HA2 - speciﬁc antibody (cid:2) Ha2 - C ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) as the pri - mary antibody . The signal was detected using a BCIP / NBT kit ( Sino - American ) . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle as described by Pardee and Spudich ( 1982 ) and stored at − 80 ◦ C in a modiﬁed G buffer ( 5 mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP ) . 2 . 4 . Immunoprecipitations Immunoprecipitations were carried out using Seize Protein A ( Ptglab , USA ) . Brieﬂy , 20 - ml cultures of Hz - AM1 cells ( 10 7 cells ) were infected with vHa - Ha2 - egfp virus at a multiplicity of 10 PFU / cell . The cells were harvested at 72 h post - infection ( p . i . ) by centrifugation and lysed using buffer NTP ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 9 , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) Nonidet P - 40 ) . Resin slurry ( 0 . 1 ml ) containing Protein A was equilibrated and washed with the lysis buffer . Then 20 (cid:1) g of antibody (cid:2) Ha2 - C ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) was immobilized on the precleared resin and the protein extracts were added to the column and incubated at 4 ◦ C overnight in a rotary mixer . The mixture was sedimented in the column and the crude material was washed with the lysis buffer . The remaining antigen was dissociated from the anti - body with elution buffer . The elution process was repeated three more times and the fractions were examined by SDS - PAGE and Western blot analysis using a polyclonal rabbit anti actin anti - serum ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) as the primary antibody . The signal was detected using a BCIP / NBT kit ( Sino - American ) . 2 . 5 . Visualization of polymerization Virus or protein samples were mixed with 3 (cid:1) M G - actin ( unlabeled ) , then 20 (cid:1) l of rhodamine phalloidin in AP buffer ( 25 mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM EGTA ) was added , mixed well and incubated overnight on ice in the dark . Fluorescent ﬁlaments were examined by microscopy ( Lanier and Volkman , 1998 ) . After polymerization in the presence of rhodamine - phalloidin , actin was diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 nM in ﬂuorescence buffer containing 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 20 mg / ml cata - lase , 100 mg / ml glucose oxidase , 3 mg / ml glucose . Samples of 2 (cid:1) l were applied to coverslips coated in 0 . 1 % nitrocellu - lose and the ﬂuorescence was viewed using a Leica DC 300F microscope with a mercury illumination source ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000a ) . Actin branches were visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy and images were analyzed using Image - Pro Plus 5 . 0 software . 2 . 6 . Pyrene – actin polymerization studies Pyrene – actin ( Cytosleleton Inc . ) and unlabeled actin were mixed in G - buffer to generate a 3 - (cid:1) M monomeric actin solution with 10 – 15 % pyrene – actin . Polymerization reactions contained 50 mM KCl , 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , supplemented with sBV or HA2 alone or in the presence of HA2 and Arp2 / 3 complex ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) . Ca 2 + - actin was converted to Mg 2 + - actin prior to each polymerization reaction by incubation with 50 (cid:1) M MgCl 2 , 200 (cid:1) M EGTA for 2 min . Pyrene ﬂuorescence was measured using a spectroﬂuorimeter ( RF - 5301 PC Shimadzu ) at 25 ◦ C , with excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 and 407 nm , respectively . Q . Wang et al . / Virus Research 127 ( 2007 ) 81 – 87 83 2 . 7 . Immunoﬂuorescence staining Sterile coverslips were placed in Petri dishes and seeded at a density of 10 6 cells / dish . After the cells had attached , the culture medium was removed and the cells were infected with vHa - Ha2 - egfp at an MOI of 10 PFU / cell . At 72 h p . i . , cells were ﬁxed with 2 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized in 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 10 min . The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies for 60 min , washed with PBS , and incubated with ﬂuorescently labeled secondary antibodies for 60 min . The ﬁxed cells were viewed using an S2 Leica laser confocal scanning microscope . F - actin was stained with rhodamine - conjugated phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . 2 . 8 . Membrane targeting of HA2 - CAAX To express HA2 at the plasma membrane of insect cells , plasmid pIZ / V5 - Myc - ha2 - CAAX , which allows the expression of N - terminal Myc - tagged and C - terminal CAAX - tagged protein in insect cells ( Friederich et al . , 1995 ) , was used . To fuse the plasma membrane localization signal CAAX ( KKKSKTKCVIM ) to HA2 , the following primers were used for PCR : 5 (cid:3) - CG GAATTCGGATTC ( Bam HI ) ATGGTTCA - ACTGCAAAGT - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - TTACATAATTACACACTTTGTC - TTTGA CTTCTTCTTAACTTGCGATTCAGTTGA - 3 (cid:3) . The DNA fragments encoding HA2 - CAAX were cloned into the Bam HI and EcoR I sites of pIZ / V5 - Myc , which contained the Myc tag from pRK5Myc - cortactin ( kindly provided by Dr . JT Parsons of UC Berkeley ) ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) . The plasmid constructed was termed pIZ / V5 - Myc - ha2 - CAAX . Hz - AM1 cells were transfected with this plasmid to express HA2 protein . Plasmid pRK5Myc - ha2 - CAAX needed to transfect mammalian cells was constructed by replacing cortactin with ha2 - CAAX . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . HearNPV nucleocapsid - induced actin polymerization It has been reported that the nucleocapsids of AcMNPV activate actin polymerization ( Lanier and Volkman , 1998 ) . SolubilizedBVofHearNPVwasmixedwithG - actinunderpoly - merization conditions , resulting in increased levels of F - actin as observed by labeling with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Fig . 1A , a ) . The effect of HearNPV sBV on activation of actin poly - merization was positive when compared with G - actin incubated with AcMNPV sBV ( Fig . 1A , b ) . Some background sponta - neous nucleation of actin polymerization occurred in the absence of virions ( Fig . 1A , c ) , which is normal for this type of assay ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000b ) . The kinetics of actin assembly was monitored using the pyrene – actin assay to analyze the ability of HearNPV sBV to stimulate actin nucleation and accelerate actin polymerization ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) . Polymerization of actin alone was char - acterized by an initial lag phase , indicative of the kinetic barrier Fig . 1 . Nucleocapsids are capable of nucleating actin polymerization . ( A ) Fluorescence microscopy of sBV - induced in vitro polymerization of actin . Actin labeled with 3 (cid:1) M rhodamine - phalloidin was incubated with 60 (cid:1) g of HearNPV sBV ( a ) , AcMNPV sBV ( b ) , or TE ( c ) as a negative control . Scale bar represents 8 (cid:1) m . ( B and C ) Kinetics of actin assembly using the pyrene – actin assay . Polymerization assays were carried out with ( B ) 60 (cid:1) g of HearNPV and AcMNPV sBV , or ( C ) with the amount of HearNPV sBV indicated . Fluorescence emission at 407nm was recorded continuously over time . Actin polymerization is reported in arbitrary units ( A . U . ) of ﬂuorescence . 84 Q . Wang et al . / Virus Research 127 ( 2007 ) 81 – 87 to nucleation , followed by a period of relatively rapid ﬁlament elongation ( Fig . 1B ) . Addition of HearNPV sBV resulted in a modest acceleration of polymerization relative to the control , but this did not eliminate the lag phase ( Fig . 1B ) . With increasing amounts of HearNPV sBV , we observed a dose - dependent accel - eration of actin polymerization ( Fig . 1C ) . Thus , sBV is sufﬁcient for actin - ﬁlament nucleation . This suggests that HearNPV sBV may inﬂuence the spatial and temporal distribution of actin poly - merization in cells and actin might be involved in the assembly and transport of HearNPV virions . 3 . 2 . HA2 stimulates the nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro Many baculoviruses encode a nucleocapsid structural protein homologous to HA2 of HearNPV and AcMNPV P78 / 83 , which contains all the conserved domains of WASP - family proteins ( Machesky et al . , 2001 ; Nie et al . , 2006 ) . It has been reported that P78 / 83 binds to actin and that HA2 co - localizes with cel - lular actin in insect cells ( Lanier and Volkman , 1998 ; Nie et al . , 2006 ) . Immunoprecipitation experiments with a speciﬁc HA2 antibody ( (cid:2) Ha2 - C ) furtherdemonstratedthedirectinteractionof HA2 with insect cellular actin ( Fig . 2A ) . These data suggest that HA2 and its homologues in baculoviruses bind to and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex and induce actin assembly , as previously described for WASP - family proteins ( Mullins and Machesky , 2000 ) . To test this hypothesis , we investigated whether puriﬁed HA2 and the Arp2 / 3 complex could accelerate actin poly - merization in a synergistic manner , as was observed for the ActA protein of Listeria ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . The entire HA2 protein was ﬁrst expressed in Sf9 using an AcMNPV Bac - to - Bac expression system . Western blot analysis showed that the HA2 protein extracted from vAc - His - Ha2 - infected Sf9 cells was about 60 kDa ( Fig . 2B ) , which is larger than both the pre - dicted 49 . 8 kDa based on its sequence and 50 kDa of wild - type HA2 ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) . This could be due to different post - translational modiﬁcations in Sf9 and Hz - AM1 lines . We further visualized the polymerization of actin induced by puriﬁed HA2 in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex and found a dramatic increase in the amount of F - actin stained with rhodamine - phalloidin in vitro ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that HA2 can induce G - actin polymerization into F - actin and activate Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization . To obtain a quantitative measure of the activity of HA2 , pyrene – actin ﬂuorescence was used to monitor actin assembly in the presence of HA2 . The kinetics of assembly with HA2 was not signiﬁcantly different from that of actin alone , indicating that , on its own , HA2 was unable to stimulate actin polymer - ization ( Fig . 2C ) . When both Arp2 / 3 complex and HA2 were present , the slope of the elongation phase was increased and the lag phase was shorter , although not completely eliminated , indicating that Arp2 / 3 complex and HA2 function together as a highly efﬁcient nucleating site . Moreover , increased amounts of HA2 and a ﬁxed concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex caused a concentration - dependant acceleration of actin polymerization ( Fig . 2C ) . Thus , HA2 is sufﬁcient to activate Arp2 / 3 complex and to produce an acceleration of actin polymerization in vitro . 3 . 3 . Branching assay of actin ﬁlaments The Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides of actin ﬁlaments and caps the pointed ends , and has been shown to localize at the branch points of dendritic actin arrays in vitro and in vivo ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Light microscopy provided evidence that stimulation of actin nucleation by WASP - family proteins increased the number of actin branches formed by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Mullins and Machesky , 2000 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex links the pointed ends of actin ﬁlaments to the sides of other ﬁlaments at an angle of 70 ◦ ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ) . To deﬁne whether HA2 stimulates the actin branching activ - ity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , we visualized the structures formed in vitro by staining actin ﬁlaments with rhodamine - phalloidin and found that 44 . 8 % of the actin ﬁlaments generated were associ - atedwithbranchedstructures ( Fig . 3 ) . Incontrast , actinﬁlaments polymerizedinthepresenceoftheArp2 / 3complexaloneorHA2 alone were infrequently branched ( 2 . 0 % and 1 . 0 % , respectively ) ( Fig . 3 ) . When actin alone was tested , a few , relatively long actin ﬁlaments were observed . This demonstrated that HA2 stimu - lated the branching activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . It should be noted that HearNPV sBV , without the addition of Arp2 / 3 Fig . 2 . HA2 stimulates the nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 in vitro .

( A ) Images of actin ﬁlament branched structure nucleated by 50nM HA2 ( a ) , 20nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( b ) , 50nM HA2 and 20nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( c ) , 40 (cid:1) g HearNPV sBV ( d ) were visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy . The scale bar represents 8 (cid:1) m . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of actin branches formed in the presence of indicated components was analyzed using Image - Pro Plus 5 . 0 software . Branching was quantiﬁed as follows : % branching = ( number of branched ﬁlaments / number of total ﬁlaments ) × 100 . complex , could also stimulate the actin branching . This strongly suggests that baculovirus virions might contain some elements that function in a manner similar to the Arp2 / 3 complex . 3 . 4 . HA2 induces actin rearrangement in vivo Since known Arp2 / 3 activators are involved in the forma - tion of plasma membrane protrusions or disruption of the actin cytoskeleton , we were interested in analyzing how HA2 would behave when expressed at the plasma membrane . We there - fore constructed a plasmid pIZ / V5 - Myc - ha2 - CAAX expressing HA2 - CAAX , designed to drive expression of the protein at the inner face of the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4A ) . Hz - AM1 cells were transfected with this plasmid as previously performed for RickA ( Gouin et al . , 2004 ) . HA2 expression resulted in an increase in diffuse phalloidin staining at the cell periphery and a complete loss of cell ﬁlopodia ( Fig . 4B ) . In contrast , F - actin labeling was limited to the cell cortex in cells transfected with empty plasmids ( Fig . 4C ) . 3 . 5 . Arp2 / 3 complex was recruited to the nucleus and co - localized with Ha2 in infected Hz - AM1 cells It has been reported that F - actin is located in the nucleus in the late stages of baculovirus infection ( Ohkawa and Volkman , 1999 ) , while Arp2 / 3 complex was found mainly in Fig . 4 .

Hz - AM1 cells were transfected with the DNA construct encoding HA2 - CAAX . Cultures of cells were analyzed 48h after transfection .

Scale bar represents 10 (cid:1) m . the lamellipodia of crawling cells and in actin - rich spots of unknown function ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) . It was therefore very interesting to investigate whether Arp2 / 3 complex was also involved in nuclear actin polymerization during infection with HearNPV . We infected Hz - AM1 cells with vHa - Ha2 - egfp and detected Arp2 / 3 recruitment in the cells . Using anti - Arp3 antibody ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) , we found that Arp3 was recruited to the nucleus of infected cells and co - localized with HA2 ( Fig . 5 ) . It has previously been shown that the Arp2 / 3 complex subunits Arp3 , Arp2 , p34 - Arc and p21 - Arc co - localize in cells ( Machesky et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ) . 4 . Discussion Several viruses and intracellular bacterial pathogens exploit the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton of their host cells during their life cycles , but most of them do so only upon entry into host cells ( Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ; Cudmore et al . , 1997 ; Smith et al . , 2003 ) . Some also use actin for intracellular locomotion ( Dramsi and Cossart , 1998 ) . Over the last few years , studies of actin - based motility of the bacterial pathogens Listeria , Shigella and Rickettsia have yielded insights into the events occurring at the leading edges of motile cells ( Carlier et al . , 2003 ; Loisel et al . , 1999 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1998 ) . The data presented here show that HearNPV sBV has the ability to nucleate actin polymerization in vitro . This ﬁnd - ing is consistent with previous research demonstrating that AcMNPV nucleocapsids induce the formation of actin cables shortly after entry into the host - cell cytoplasm and that ﬁla - mentous actin is required for lepidopteran nucleopolyhedrovirus progeny production ( Charlton and Volkman , 1993 ; Kasman and Volkman , 2000 ) . Therefore , both group I ( AcMNPV ) and Group II ( HearNPV ) NPVs are able to induce actin polymerization . Recently , we showed that HA2 shares the same motifs as the mammalian WASP family ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) . Supporting a role for HA2 as an activator that directs actin - polymerization - based motility in vitro , we ﬁrst demonstrated an interaction between HA2 and actin in cells infected with vHa - Ha2 - egfp through immunoprecipitation . This ﬁnding is in total agreement with the ﬁnding that HA2 - EGFP co - localized with the cellular actin skeleton ( Nie et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that HA2 may shuttle G - actin to the Arp2 / 3 complex for addition into ﬁlaments and may recruit actin to play a critical role in motility . This clearly demonstrates that the replication of group I or II nucleopoly - hedroviruses is F - actin - dependent . F - actin - dependent progeny morphogenesis appears to be a characteristic common to viruses inthisgenusthathavelepidopteranhosts ( KasmanandVolkman , 2000 ) . We found that HA2 , indeed , stimulated the nucleat - ing activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex based on data obtained by pyrene – actin assay and ﬂuorescence microscopy . Over - expression of HA2 on the cell membrane disrupted actin assembly at the cell periphery and led to an increase in diffuse phalloidin staining ( Fig . 4 ) . The disruption of peripheral actin assembly is likely to be a consequence of rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton by HA2 and the Arp2 / 3 complex . Recently , it was reported that AcMNPV P78 / 83 has the capability of sub - stituting for WASP in Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin - polymerization reactions in vitro ( Goley et al . , 2006 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex binds to and cross - links actin ﬁla - ments end - to - side at a ﬁxed angle ( 70 ◦ ) and organizes them into mechanically rigid networks . Branched assays provided evidence of the ability of HA2 to promote branched - ﬁlament formation by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Since nucleocapsids of HearNPV directly nucleated actin ﬁlaments , we next investi - gated whether nucleocapsids had an effect on actin ﬁlament architecture . Our data clearly show that nucleocapsids induced actin ﬁlament nucleation and formed branched arrays . We pos - tulate that nucleocapsid - associated actin may bind to HA2 , with the total complex acting as a nucleus or a seed for actin poly - merization . Evidence obtained from biochemical data and cellular local - ization of HA2 indicates that HA2 stimulates actin nucleation by interacting with the Arp2 / 3 complex and regulating the cel - lular actin cytoskeleton by de novo formation of actin ﬁlaments through a dendritic nucleation mechanism . It has been reported that nuclear F - actin is required for NPV infection of lepidopteran cells ( Ohkawa and Volkman , 1999 ) . Six nuclear localization G - actin ( NLA ) genes have been identiﬁed that mediate nuclear localization of G - actin ( Ohkawa et al . , 2002 ) . Here we determined recruitment of the Arp2 / 3 complex in the nucleus of infected cells and its interaction with HA2 . The re - localization of Arp2 / 3 suggests that there might be an organizational role for the Arp2 / 3 complex in the actin cytoskeleton that affects the assembly of virions . Taken together , both the in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that HA2 is another baculovirus activator of actin nucleation and requires the Arp2 / 3 complex to initiate an actin polymerization process similar to ActA in Listeria , which represents a general strategy Q .
