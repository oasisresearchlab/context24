Introduction It is widely believed that social contagion and word - of - mouth ( WOM ) “buzz” about products drive prod - uct adoption and sales , and ﬁrms increasingly rely on “network” and “viral” marketing strategies ( Hill et al . 2006 , Manchanda et al . 2008 , Nam et al . 2010 ) . Yet , whereas most current work has focused on viral mar - keting campaigns for existing products , less attention has been paid to whether ( and how ) ﬁrms can design products that are themselves more likely to go viral . The effectiveness of such viral product design strategies have yet to be examined or causally estimated . We therefore conducted a large - scale randomized ﬁeld experiment to test the effectiveness of different viral product design features in creating peer inﬂuence and social contagion in new product diffusion . Viral product design—the process of explicitly engi - neering products so they are more likely to be shared among peers—has existed at least since the ﬁrst chain letter was sent in 1888 . Today , products regu - larly use information technology ( IT ) - enabled features like automated broadcast notiﬁcations and person - alized invitations to spread product awareness . Yet , although viral features have become more sophisti - cated and a central part of the design of products and marketing campaigns , there is almost no empir - ical evidence on the effectiveness of such features in generating social contagion and product adoption . We therefore investigate two basic questions : Can ﬁrms add viral features to products so they are more likely to be shared among peers ? If so , which viral features are most effective in inducing WOM and peer - to - peer inﬂuence in product adoption ? Unfortunately , evaluating the effects of viral prod - uct design features is difﬁcult because peer effects and WOM are typically endogenous ( Manski 1993 ; Godes and Mayzlin 2004 , 2009 ; Hartmann et al . 2008 ; Aral et al . 2009 ; Aral 2011 ) . We therefore designed and conducted a randomized ﬁeld experiment test - ing the effectiveness of two of the most widely used viral product features—active - personalized referrals and passive - broadcast notiﬁcations—in creating peer inﬂuence and social contagion among the 1 . 4 million friends of 9 , 687 experimental users of Facebook . com . The experiment uses a customized commercial Facebook application to observe user behavior , com - munications trafﬁc , and the peer inﬂuence effects of randomly enabled viral messaging features on application diffusion and use in the local networks of experimental and control population users . By 1623 Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design 1624 Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS enabling and disabling viral features among ran - domly selected users , we were able to obtain rela - tively unbiased causal estimates of the impact of viral features on the adoption rates of peers in the local networks of adopters . Using detailed clickstream data on users’ online behaviors , we also explored whether positive network externalities generated by additional peer adopters inspired further product adoption and sustained product use . WOM is generally considered to be more effec - tive at promoting product contagion when it is personalized and active . Surprisingly , we ﬁnd that designing products with passive - broadcast viral mes - saging capabilities generates a 246 % increase in local peer inﬂuence and social contagion , whereas adding active - personalized viral messaging capa - bilities generates only an additional 98 % increase . Although active - personalized messaging is more effective in encouraging adoption per message and is correlated with more user engagement and sus - tained product use , it is used less often and there - fore generates less total peer adoption in the network . Overall , we ﬁnd that viral product design features generate econometrically identiﬁable peer inﬂuence and social contagion effects and provide a model for how randomized trials can identify peer inﬂuence in networks . 2 . Viral Product Design Since the early work of Katz and Lazersﬂed ( 1955 ) there has been great interest in how WOM drives con - sumer demand , public opinion , and product diffusion ( Brown and Reingen 1987 , Godes and Mayzlin 2004 , Aral et al . 2009 ) and how ﬁrms can create broad , sys - tematic propagation of WOM through consumer pop - ulations ( Phelps et al . 2004 , Mayzlin 2006 , Dellarocas 2006 , Godes and Mayzlin 2009 ) . Many campaigns target “inﬂuential” individuals who are likely to propagate organic WOM most broadly ( Katz and Lazersfeld 1955 , Watts and Dodds 2007 , Goldenberg et al . 2009 ) , using referral programs to create incen - tives for them to spread the word ( Biyalogorsky et al . 2001 ) . Others use observational evidence on viral campaigns to inform viral branching models of WOM diffusion ( Van der Lans et al . 2010 ) . However , to this point , studies of viral product design have remained conspicuously absent from the literature on viral marketing . Viral product design involves incorporating speciﬁc characteristics and features into a product’s design to generate peer - to - peer inﬂuence that encourages adop - tion . A product’s viral characteristics are fundamentally about its content and the psychological effects content can have on a user’s desire to share the product with peers ( Stephen and Berger 2009 , Berger and Heath 2005 , Heath et al . 2001 ) . A product’s viral features , on the other hand , concern how the product is shared— how features enable and constrain a product’s use in relation to other consumers . Viral features may enable communication , generate automated notiﬁcations of users’ activities , facilitate personalized invitations , or enable hypertext embedding of the product on pub - licly available websites and weblogs . Two of the most widely used viral product features are personalized referrals and automated broadcast notiﬁcations : Personalized Referrals . Personalized referral features allow users to select their friends or contacts from a list and invite them to adopt the product or ser - vice , with the option of attaching a personalized mes - sage to the invitation . Social networking websites enable users to “invite their friends” to join the service through personalized referrals . When users send Web - based e - mail messages , for example , from Gmail , an automated , pop - up hyperlink enables them to invite recipients to join the service . Automated Broadcast Notiﬁcations . Automated broad - cast notiﬁcations are passively triggered by normal user activity . When a user engages the product in a certain way ( e . g . , sends a message , updates his or her status ) , those actions are broadcast as notiﬁca - tions to the user’s list of contacts . Notiﬁcations build awareness among friends of new activities or prod - ucts a user is adopting or engaging with , and can encourage those friends to eventually adopt the prod - uct themselves . For example , social networking web - sites typically notify friends automatically when a user adopts a new application or achieves some appli - cation milestone . Referrals are more personalized and targeted than broadcast notiﬁcations . Users actively select a sub - set of their social network to receive them ( target - ing ) and can include personal messages in the referral ( personalization ) . WOM is generally considered more effective at promoting product contagion when it is personalized and active . When individuals choose to share information about products and services with their friends , they tend to activate their strong - tie relationships ( Frenzen and Nakamoto 1993 , Aral and Van Alstyne 2011 ) . Strong ties exhibit greater homophily ( Jackson 2008 ) , greater pressure for con - formity ( Coleman 1988 ) , and deeper knowledge about one another . We tend to trust information from close “trusted” sources more and to respond more often to them because of reciprocity ( Emerson 1962 ) . In addition , the personalization of messages makes them more effective , especially in online environments in which we are bombarded with irrelevant information ( Tam and Ho 2005 , Tucker 2010 ) . For these reasons , one might suspect that personal - ized referrals are more effective than broadcast notiﬁ - cations . But , although each personalized referral may Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS 1625 be more persuasive ( more effective per message ) , the pervasiveness of automated broadcast messages that do not require additional time and energy on the part of the user may lead to greater overall peer adop - tion . The effort required by the user to actively select and invite peers to adopt the product may curtail widespread use of the personalized referral and so limit its effectiveness in encouraging broad adoption . The relative overall effectiveness of these viral fea - tures is therefore ultimately an empirical question . 3 . Experimental Design and Procedures Evaluating the effects of viral product design fea - tures on social contagion is difﬁcult because peer effects and WOM are typically endogenous ( Manski 1993 , Hartmann et al . 2008 , Van den Bulte and Lilien 2001 , Godes and Mayzlin 2004 , Van den Bulte and Iyengar 2011 ) . Several approaches for identifying peer effects have been proposed , including peer effects models and extended spatial autoregressive mod - els ( e . g . , Oestreicher - Singer and Sundararajan 2008 , Trusov et al . 2009 , Bramoulle et al . 2009 ) , actor - oriented models ( e . g . , Snijders et al . 2006 ) , instrumen - tal variable methods based on natural experiments ( e . g . , Sacredote 2001 , Tucker 2008 ) , dynamic matched sample estimation ( Aral et al . 2009 ) , structural models ( e . g . , Ghose and Han 2010 ) , and ad hoc approaches ( Christakis and Fowler 2007 ) . However , randomized trials are considered to be one of the most effec - tive ways to obtain unbiased estimates of causal peer effects ( Duﬂo et al . 2008 , Hartmann et al . 2008 ) . We therefore partnered with a ﬁrm that develops commercial applications hosted on the popular social networking website Facebook . com and collected experimental data on the peer inﬂuence effects of enabling viral features on the diffusion one of their applications . This application is free to adopt and pro - vides users the opportunity to share information and opinions about movies , actors , directors , and the ﬁlm industry in general . We designed multiple experimen - tal versions of the application in which personalized invitations and broadcast notiﬁcations were enabled or disabled , and randomly assigned adopting users to various experimental and control conditions . As users adopted the application , each was randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions or the baseline control condition . The application collected personal attributes and preferences from users’ Facebook pro - ﬁles , as well as data on their social networks and the personal attributes and preferences of their network neighbors . 1 1 Facebook allows users to specify privacy settings that may restrict an application’s access to some or part of their proﬁle . This is The experiment enabled experimental group users to use passive - broadcast and active - personalized viral messaging capabilities to exchange messages with their network neighbors , while disabling those fea - tures for the baseline control group . The application then recorded data on the use of these viral fea - tures by experimental group users , as well as click - stream data on recipient responses to viral messages and their subsequent adoption and use of the appli - cation . When an individual adopted the application as a result of peer inﬂuence , their treatment sta - tus was also randomized to ensure that the stable unit treatment value assumption held . This facilitated analysis of the relative effectiveness of different viral messaging channels in generating peer adoption and network propagation . Randomization also enabled exploration of the mechanisms by which a particular viral channel inﬂuenced recipient behavior . Two pri - mary viral features were examined : Automated Broadcast Notiﬁcations ( Notiﬁcations ) . When enabled , notiﬁcations were generated automat - ically when an application user performed certain actions within the application , such as declaring a favorite movie or writing a movie review . When notiﬁcations were generated , they were distributed to a random subset of an application user’s peers and displayed in a status bar at the bottom of the peers’ Facebook environment . When a peer clicked on the notiﬁcation , they were taken to an application canvas page where they were given the option to install the application . These notiﬁcations required no effort beyond normal application use , making their engagement relatively costless to the user . Because they were randomly distributed to a Facebook user’s peers and were not accompanied by a personalized message , they also exhibited low personalization . Personalized Referrals or Invitations ( Invites ) . When enabled , invites allowed application users to send their Facebook peers personalized invitations to install the application . Peers received the invitation in their Facebook inbox and could click on a referral link contained within the invitation . If they did so , they were taken to the application canvas page where they were given the opportunity to install the application . Each invite required a conscious and deliberate action from the user beyond typical application use , requir - ing more effort ( activity ) than notiﬁcations . Because invites were targeted to speciﬁc peers and allowed the inclusion of a personalized message , they also exhib - ited greater personalization . unlikely to have a signiﬁcant effect on the study , because it is esti - mated that less than 2 % of Facebook users alter default privacy settings ( Gross et al . 2005 ) .

Users assigned to the baseline treatment group received a version of the application in which both notiﬁcations and invites were disabled . In the passive - broadcast treatment group ( passive ) , only notiﬁca - tions were enabled . In the active - personalized treat - ment group ( active ) , both notiﬁcations and invites were enabled . There were no other differences between baseline , passive , and active applications . Throughout the experiment , each adopter of the application was randomly assigned to a treatment group according to the proportions displayed in Table 1 . The proportion of users assigned to the baseline was chosen in agreement with the applica - tion developer to obtain a population size sufﬁcient to establish a comparative baseline , while limiting potential adverse effects on the overall diffusion of the product . 2 Detailed logs of application user activity , adoption times , viral feature use , peer response , and applica - tion user and peer proﬁle data were recorded , as were social network relationships for application adopters and mutual ties between peers of application users . Our experimental design allowed us to measure the effect of each of the viral features on the adoption response of peers , as displayed in Figure 1 . We also measured adopters’ use by recording activity logs that detailed each time a user took an action on the application . 3 . 1 . Recruitment At the launch of the experiment , we designed an advertising campaign in collaboration with a second Facebook advertising ﬁrm to recruit a representative population of Facebook users . Advertisements were displayed to users through advertising space within Facebook and within existing Facebook applications . The campaign was conducted in three waves through - out the duration of the experiment and cost a total of $ 6 , 000 to recruit 9 , 687 usable experimental subjects , 2 The developer feared too many baseline users could stunt the viral diffusion of the application and therefore insisted that the number of baseline users be limited . Limiting baseline users should not bias results as the proportion of baseline users to either treatment group is constant across treatments and should only make our estimates more conservative in that analyses comparing a treatment group to the baseline group will have less power .

The number of impressions , clicks , and installation responses are displayed in Table 2 . Summary statistics of the recruited study population are described in § 4 . Comparisons to published demo - graphic statistics indicate the sample is indeed repre - sentative of typical Facebook users ( see the appendix ) . The application was also publically listed in Face - book’s Application Directory and so was available to anyone on Facebook . 4 . Empirical Methods 4 . 1 . Data and Descriptive Statistics The experiment was conducted over a 44 - day period , during which 9 , 687 initial users adopted the applica - tion , with 405 users randomly assigned to the baseline control group , 4 , 600 users randomly assigned to the passive - broadcast treatment group , and 4 , 682 users randomly assigned to the active - personalized treat - ment group . Users in these groups collectively had 1 . 4 million distinct peers in their local social networks and sent a total of 70 , 140 viral messages to their peers , resulting in 992 peer adoptions—682 of which were in direct response to viral messages . Three main observations arise from consideration of the summary statistics of the resultant data displayed in Table 3 . First , assignment to control and treatment groups was clearly random , with no signiﬁcant mean or dis - tributional differences between users in terms of their age , gender , network degree ( number of Facebook friends ) , and level of Facebook activity ( number of Table 2 Recruitment Statistics Describing the Initial Advertising Campaign Advertising Wave Impressions Clicks related installs Installs 1 ( Day 0 ) 18 (cid:49) 264 (cid:49) 600 12 (cid:49) 334 3 (cid:49) 072 3 (cid:49) 714 2 ( Day 15 ) 20 (cid:49) 912 (cid:49) 880 25 (cid:49) 709 2 (cid:49) 619 3 (cid:49) 474 3 ( Day 20 ) 19 (cid:49) 957 (cid:49) 640 7 (cid:49) 624 3 (cid:49) 219 4 (cid:49) 039 Total 59 (cid:49) 135 (cid:49) 120 45 (cid:49) 667 8 (cid:49) 910 11 (cid:49) 227 Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS 1627 Table 3 Summary Statistics and Mean Comparisons of Active , Passive , and Baseline Users 1 2 3 4 5 6 Baseline Passive Active t - statistic t - statistic t - statistic ( N = 405 ) ( N = 4 (cid:49) 600 ) ( N = 4 (cid:49) 682 ) ( B - P ) ( B - A ) ( P - A ) Mean Mean Mean t - statistic t - statistic t - statistic ( SD ) ( SD ) ( SD ) ( SE ) ( SE ) ( SE ) Age 31 (cid:48) 51 30 (cid:48) 81 29 (cid:48) 94 0 (cid:48) 46 1 (cid:48) 03 1 (cid:48) 45 (cid:52) 13 (cid:48) 80 (cid:53) (cid:52) 13 (cid:48) 31 (cid:53) (cid:52) 13 (cid:48) 27 (cid:53) (cid:52) 13 (cid:48) 35 (cid:53) (cid:52) 13 (cid:48) 31 (cid:53) (cid:52) 13 (cid:48) 24 (cid:53) Gender ( 1 = male ) 0 (cid:48) 25 0 (cid:48) 33 0 (cid:48) 32 − 1 (cid:48) 57 − 1 (cid:48) 42 0 (cid:48) 40 (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 44 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 47 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 47 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 47 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 46 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 47 (cid:53) Degree a 171 (cid:48) 79 170 (cid:48) 25 166 (cid:48) 97 0 (cid:48) 09 0 (cid:48) 32 0 (cid:48) 55 (cid:52) 223 (cid:48) 88 (cid:53) (cid:52) 278 (cid:48) 64 (cid:53) (cid:52) 248 (cid:48) 77 (cid:53) (cid:52) 275 (cid:48) 13 (cid:53) (cid:52) 247 (cid:48) 15 (cid:53) (cid:52) 263 (cid:48) 82 (cid:53) Number of Facebook wall posts 40 (cid:48) 52 36 (cid:48) 45 37 (cid:48) 07 0 (cid:48) 46 0 (cid:48) 15 − 0 (cid:48) 09 (cid:52) 79 (cid:48) 89 (cid:53) (cid:52) 94 (cid:48) 16 (cid:53) (cid:52) 246 (cid:48) 76 (cid:53) (cid:52) 93 (cid:48) 11 (cid:53) (cid:52) 238 (cid:48) 20 (cid:53) (cid:52) 188 (cid:48) 31 (cid:53) Number of adopters in user’s local network 0 (cid:48) 01 0 (cid:48) 07 0 (cid:48) 10 − 2 (cid:48) 84 ∗∗∗ − 3 (cid:48) 60 ∗∗∗ − 3 (cid:48) 64 ∗∗∗ (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 12 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 35 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 44 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 34 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 43 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 40 (cid:53) Percentage of adopters in user’s local network 0 (cid:48) 02 0 (cid:48) 09 0 (cid:48) 15 − 1 (cid:48) 92 ∗ − 2 (cid:48) 35 ∗∗ − 2 (cid:48) 83 ∗∗∗ (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 002 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 01 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 01 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 01 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 01 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 01 (cid:53) Maximum diffusion depth 0 (cid:48) 01 0 (cid:48) 04 0 (cid:48) 05 − 2 (cid:48) 53 ∗ − 3 (cid:48) 01 ∗∗∗ − 1 (cid:48) 98 ∗∗∗ (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 11 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 22 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 24 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 21 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 24 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 23 (cid:53) Time to 1st adopter 9 (cid:48) 40 4 (cid:48) 77 3 (cid:48) 17 1 (cid:48) 27 2 (cid:48) 04 ∗∗ 2 (cid:48) 45 ∗∗∗ (cid:52) 9 (cid:48) 71 (cid:53) (cid:52) 8 (cid:48) 04 (cid:53) (cid:52) 6 (cid:48) 72 (cid:53) (cid:52) 8 (cid:48) 07 (cid:53) (cid:52) 6 (cid:48) 77 (cid:53) (cid:52) 7 (cid:48) 30 (cid:53) Time to 2nd adopter — 5 (cid:48) 23 4 (cid:48) 43 — — 0 (cid:48) 58 (cid:52) 8 (cid:48) 17 (cid:53) (cid:52) 6 (cid:48) 97 (cid:53) (cid:52) 7 (cid:48) 45 (cid:53) Time to 3rd adopter — 5 (cid:48) 29 3 (cid:48) 04 — — 1 (cid:48) 08 (cid:52) 8 (cid:48) 07 (cid:53) (cid:52) 5 (cid:48) 25 (cid:53) (cid:52) 6 (cid:48) 33 (cid:53) Time to 4th adopter — 6 1 (cid:48) 17 — — 2 (cid:48) 84 ∗∗∗ (cid:52) 5 (cid:48) 83 (cid:53) (cid:52) 1 (cid:48) 12 (cid:53) (cid:52) 3 (cid:48) 58 (cid:53) Application use 3 (cid:48) 17 4 (cid:48) 17 4 (cid:48) 56 − 2 (cid:48) 54 ∗∗ − 2 (cid:48) 89 ∗∗∗ − 2 (cid:48) 20 ∗ (cid:52) 4 (cid:48) 59 (cid:53) (cid:52) 7 (cid:48) 24 (cid:53) (cid:52) 8 (cid:48) 98 (cid:53) (cid:52) 7 (cid:48) 08 (cid:53) (cid:52) 8 (cid:48) 73 (cid:53) (cid:52) 8 (cid:48) 16 (cid:53) Notes .

Facebook wall posts ) , conﬁrming the integrity of the randomization procedure . Second , whereas their demographics and Facebook activity patterns were the same , measures of peer response in the network neighborhoods of treated users differed signiﬁcantly across the treatment and control populations . T - tests show that the number and percentage of peer adopters in a user’s local net - work are signiﬁcantly higher for treated populations than for the baseline population . The number of peer adopters in a user’s local network is approximately 7 times greater for users in the passive - broadcast treatment group and 10 times greater for users in the active - personalized group . Similarly , compared to the baseline group , the percentage of adopters in a user’s local network is approximately 450 % higher for users in the passive - broadcast group and 750 % higher for users in the active - personalized group . Measures of the speed of adoption in a treated user’s local network , as indicated by the time to the ﬁrst , sec - ond , third , and fourth adoption events , reveal that the treatments increased the rate of adoption in a treated user’s local network . The time to the ﬁrst peer adop - tion is approximately 200 % shorter for users in the passive - broadcast treatment group and approximately 300 % shorter for users in the active - personalized group . The extent to which the treatment leads to adoption beyond a user’s immediate local network can be measured by the maximal diffusion depth— the maximum network distance from a treated user to any peer adopter in a linked chain of adoptions . The average maximal diffusion depth is approximately Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design 1628 Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS 360 % greater for the passive - broadcast treatment group and 450 % greater for the active - personalized treatment group compared to baseline users . T - tests reveal these differences are highly signiﬁcant . Finally , the extent to which each treatment leads to increased application use is measured by users’ average application activity . Average application activity is approximately 130 % higher in the passive - broadcast treatment group and 140 % higher in the active - personalized treatment group . We go beyond these initial statistics and explore more formal mod - els of peer inﬂuence and social contagion in the next several sections . 4 . 2 . Model Speciﬁcation Our main statistical approach uses hazard modeling , which is the standard technique for assessing con - tagion in economics , marketing , and sociology ( e . g . , Van den Bulte and Lilien 2001 , Iyengar et al . 2011 , Nam et al . 2010 ) . This approach typically represents the hazard of adoption for individual i at time t as a function of individual characteristics and social inﬂuence : (cid:139)(cid:52)t(cid:49)x(cid:49)w(cid:49)y(cid:53) = f (cid:18) x i (cid:52)t(cid:53)(cid:131)(cid:49)(cid:130) (cid:88) j w ij y j (cid:52)t(cid:53) (cid:19) (cid:49) where (cid:139)(cid:52)t(cid:53) represents the baseline hazard of adoption , x i (cid:52)t(cid:53) is a vector of variables unrelated to social inﬂu - ence that affect i ’s adoption decision , w ij is the social exposure of i to peer j , y j (cid:52)t(cid:53) is the adoption status of peer j at time t , and (cid:131) and (cid:130) are parameters to be estimated . Our circumstances , however , required a slightly dif - ferent approach . We are interested in estimating the treatment effects of randomly assigned viral features on the adoption of peers of experimental and control users , rather than the effects of users’ social environ - ments on their own adoption decisions . Controlling users’ entire social environments is typically too com - plex and costly to be accomplished reliably in the ﬁeld . We therefore adopted an “inside - out” strategy that estimated the peer effects of the treatment “out - ward” from an individual to their peers , rather than estimating the effects of an individual’s social envi - ronment “inward” on their own adoption hazard ( see the appendix ) . Our approach compares the hazards of adoption in the social environments of users treated with pas - sive and active viral applications to the hazards of adoption in the social environments of users treated with the baseline application . The analysis therefore involves multiple failure time data in which multiple peer adoptions can occur for the same user over time . Failure times are correlated within users’ local net - works , violating the assumption of independence of failure times required in traditional survival analysis . Network effects may also make contagion a function of prior adoptions in a local network . We there - fore employed a variance - corrected stratiﬁed propor - tional hazards approach that accounts for the lack of independence among the multiple clustered failure times in the data and allows the baseline hazards to vary by adoption event to account for the possibility that adoption hazards vary across stages of a diffu - sion process . We estimated the following model : (cid:139) k (cid:52)t(cid:49)X ki (cid:53) = (cid:139) 0 k (cid:52)t(cid:53)e X ki (cid:130) (cid:49) in which stratiﬁcation occurs over the K adoption events , (cid:139) 0 k (cid:52)t(cid:53) represents the baseline hazard of the k th adoption event ( i ’s k th friend adopting ) , X ki rep - resents a vector of covariates affecting the adoption of i ’s neighbors ( including i ’s viral treatment status ( active , passive , or baseline ) , a measure of i ’s level of activity on the application ( application activity ) , peer notiﬁcations sent ( notiﬁcations ) , and invites sent ( invites ) ) , and (cid:130) is a vector of unknown parame - ters to be estimated . If t ik is the adoption time for the k th adoption in i ’s network , adoption times are sequential such that t ik ≥ t ik − 1 . Adoption data are time stamped in minutes and seconds , ensuring no two events happen at the same time . The conditional risk set at time t for event k therefore consists of all subjects under observation at time t who have experienced a k − 1 adoption event . We estimated (cid:130) using standard maximum likelihood estimation and adjusted the covariance matrix to account for non - independence across individuals i using the follow - ing robust covariance matrix ( where G is a matrix of group efﬁcient residuals ) : V = I − 1 G (cid:48) GI − 1 (cid:48) 4 . 3 . Robustness We conducted numerous additional analyses to ensure that our results are robust to selection bias , contamination , information leakage , and multiple alternative speciﬁcations of the contagion model . First , selection bias could occur when a user chooses to adopt the experimental application through the recruitment campaign or when they adopt in response to a viral message . We took steps to measure and miti - gate both possibilities . The recruitment campaign was designed to reach a representative audience of Face - book users . The demographics of our study popula - tion are comparable to those of the broader Facebook population , and published Facebook demographics fall within one standard deviation of study popu - lation sample means . In addition , application users that adopt because of peer inﬂuence may themselves be subject to selection effects and may therefore be fundamentally different than application users that adopted via initial recruitment . We eliminate these Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS 1629 sources of selection bias by only considering initially recruited users in the randomized treatment group to which they were assigned . Second , in randomized trials in network environ - ments , users assigned to different treatment groups may not strictly be isolated from one another . This raises the concern that information leakage through indirect network pathways may contaminate the results of the study . It is important to note that in traditional studies , whether or not the network is observed , relationships that create leakage effects may still exist between treatment and control populations . One beneﬁt of our design is that we systematically observe how individuals in the study are connected , enabling us to measure and prevent leakage . Even when making conservative assumptions about the decay of information ﬂow and quality over network distance , we estimate potential leakage effects to be small . 3 However , to ensure robustness , we controlled for leakage by ( a ) evaluating peer adoption only in the local networks of recruited users and ( b ) right censor - ing peers when they gained more than one adopter friend . Finally , we tested several different functional forms and speciﬁcations of the contagion model . Detailed evidence showing the robustness of our results to selection bias , contamination , leakage , and alternative model speciﬁcations are provided in the appendix . 5 . Results 5 . 1 . Effects of Viral Product Design on Peer Inﬂuence and Social Contagion Table 4 , Model 1 , displays the average treatment effects of passive - broadcast and active - personalized viral treatments on peer inﬂuence and social conta - gion in the local networks of treated users above and beyond control group users who received the base - line application . Users of the passive - broadcast appli - cation experienced a 246 % increase in the rate of application adoption by peers compared to the base - line group , whereas adding active - personalized viral messaging capabilities generated only an additional 98 % increase ( active - personalized users experienced a 344 % increase over the baseline group ) . Models 2 – 4 decompose the variance in local network adoption rates explained by these treatments by estimating how intermediate variables such as overall appli - cation activity , notiﬁcations , and invites explain the resultant increases in peer adoption . Model 3 shows that a signiﬁcant amount of the treatment effects are explained by correlated increases in users’ use of the application and the viral messages their use gener - ates . Users assigned to passive - broadcast and active - personalized applications use their applications more 3 Results of these analyses are available from the authors .

Model 4 reveals that invites have a greater marginal impact on the adoption rate of peers than notiﬁcations . One additional personal invite increases the rate of peer adoption by 6 % , whereas one addi - tional notiﬁcation increases the rate of peer adoption by only 2 % on average , conﬁrming that more person - alized active features have a greater marginal impact on the rate of peer adoption per message than passive broadcast features . The clickstream data , which record each time - stamped viral message and any response to it by peers , corroborate these results .

Invitations are the least used feature , but the most effective per message in creating peer inﬂuence and social contagion . Notiﬁca - tions , which require the least effort and are sent auto - matically to randomly selected peers , generate more messages , but are less effective per message in con - verting new users . These results together conﬁrm the main ﬁndings of the study : viral product design features do in fact gen - erate econometrically identiﬁable peer inﬂuence and social contagion effects . Features that require more activity on the part of the user and are more person - alized to recipients create greater marginal increases in the likelihood of adoption per message , but also generate fewer messages , resulting in less total peer adoption in the network .

To assess the effect of the treatment on the adoption of application users’ peers through any inﬂuence - mediating channel , in this ﬁgure we identify the time of susceptibility to inﬂuence for all peers of initial adopters . To account for ﬁxed - time effects , we look at the adoption response of all sus - ceptible peers t days after they ﬁrst became suscepti - ble . Figure 2 ( d ) plots the Kaplan – Meier survival esti - mates for baseline , passive , and active treatments . Susceptible peers of users in the passive - broadcast viral treatment group had an approximately seven - fold higher fraction of adopters in their local networks compared to baseline users . Susceptible peers of users in the active - personalized treatment group had over a 10 - fold increase in adoption fraction compared to users in the baseline group , and an additional 1 . 5 - fold increase in adoption fraction over peers of users in the passive viral treatment group . These graphs conﬁrm that viral feature design has an economically signiﬁ - cant impact on the diffusion of product adoption .

Arrows indicate causal direction . 5 . 2 . Mechanisms Driving Social Contagion Several social mechanisms could explain how viral features create product contagion . An unexpected result from the experiment enabled us to investi - gate these mechanisms . Interestingly , treated users not only had more peer adopters , but also used the appli - cation more than control group users ( see Figure 2 ( c ) ) . As Figure 2 ( c ) shows , active - personalized users used the application more than passive - broadcast users , who in turn used the application more than base - line users . This result is surprising because users were randomly assigned to different applications , and the versions were identical from users’ points of view apart from the invitation option included in the active - personalized application . Understanding why use differed across treatment groups ( despite randomization ) provides insight into how viral fea - tures create contagion and sustained product use . Viral feature inclusion , application use , and peer adoption are correlated , as shown in Table 8 , Model 1 , and Figure 2 , ( a ) and ( c ) . The randomized trial con - ﬁrms that viral features cause peer adoption . We also know that because features are randomized and not controlled by the user , no other covariate can drive the existence of features . Given these constraints , we depict the remaining possible causal relationships between feature inclusion , application use , and peer adoption in Figure 3 and evaluate the possible expla - nations for these relationships . Cases ( a ) and ( b ) in Figure 3 cannot explain the observed correlation between viral feature inclusion and peer adoption . Speciﬁcally , they are inconsistent with the discrepancy in application use between users in different treatment groups ( Figure 2 ( c ) and Table 7 ) . Cases ( c ) and ( d ) in Figure 3 represent a net - work externalities mechanism ( Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004 ) in which peer adoption drives increased application use by the original adopter . The number of peer adopters a user has is posi - tively associated with their own sustained use of the application even after controlling for their treatment status , degree , and overall Facebook activity ( Table 7 , Model 3 ) . In addition , users of active - personalized and passive - broadcast applications exhibit more use ( Table 7 , Model 1 ) , again controlling for observ - able differences in users’ overall Facebook activ - ity ( Table 7 , Model 2 ) . These results are consistent with the existence of positive network externalities— as more of their peers adopted the application , users were more engaged and used the applica - tion more . 4 Although passive - broadcast features are associated with more product use than the base - line early on , this association disappears over time ( see Figure 2 ( c ) ) . That active - personalized features are associated with sustained product use over time and passive - broadcast features are not may suggest a direct network effect from interacting with spe - ciﬁc peers—those that are personally invited to the application by their friend . Whether these effects are stronger with invited peers or not , the network effects explanation is broadly supported by the evidence and seems plausible . However , there could be alternative explanations of these results : ( 1 ) that users derive utility from use of the viral features , ( 2 ) that users derive util - ity from the mere existence of the viral features , ( 3 ) that users are more satisﬁed when they receive the viral features they expected , and ( 4 ) that other omit - ted variables create a spurious correlation between 4 Network externalities can take many forms , some of which are mediated by viral features that increase awareness of the applica - tion .

We evaluated each of these explanations in turn . First , cases ( e ) and ( f ) in Figure 3 represent a demand effect explanation in which the correlation between features and application use is explained by an increased utility from the viral features . In one variant of the demand effects explanation , use of the features themselves make the application more interesting and therefore simultaneously drives application use and peer adoption , creating a spuri - ous correlation between the two . If use of the invite and notiﬁcation features was correlated with both application use and peer adoption , and if peer adop - tion itself was not driving use , the correlation between the number of peer adopters and application use should disappear once we control for the use of invites and notiﬁcations . However , when we hold constant application use associated with both notiﬁ - cations and invites , there is still a strong positive rela - tionship between the number of peer adopters and application use ( Table 7 , Model 3 ) . This suggests that viral feature use does not fully explain the correlation between peer adoption and use . Second , it could still be that the mere existence of features rather than their use increases users’ utility . But , the data do not support this explanation either . When the viral states are entered into the regres - sion they signiﬁcantly predict application activity in the expected directions and magnitudes ( Table 7 , Model 1 ) . When the number of peer adopters is controlled , those relationships disappear completely ( Table 7 , Models 3 and 4 ) , indicating that the viral state of the application alone—or the utility from sim - ply being able to notify or invite friends—does not explain application use . Third , it could be that users are more satis - ﬁed when they receive the viral features that they Table 7 Correlates of Application Use 1 2 3 4 Application Application Application Application use use use use Beta Beta Beta Beta ( SE ) ( SE ) ( SE ) ( SE ) Viral state = passive 0 (cid:48) 129 ∗ 0 (cid:48) 112 0 (cid:48) 062 − 0 (cid:48) 037 (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 074 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 079 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 076 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 074 (cid:53) Viral state = active 0 (cid:48) 190 ∗∗∗ 0 (cid:48) 171 ∗∗ 0 (cid:48) 091 − 0 (cid:48) 006 (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 074 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 079 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 076 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 074 (cid:53) Degree − 0 (cid:48) 0001 − 0 (cid:48) 0001 − 0 (cid:48) 0002 ∗∗ − 0 (cid:48) 0002 ∗∗ (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 0001 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 0001 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 0001 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 0001 (cid:53) Facebook activity 0 (cid:48) 054 ∗∗∗ 0 (cid:48) 042 ∗∗∗ 0 (cid:48) 026 ∗ (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 016 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 015 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 014 (cid:53) Notiﬁcations 0 (cid:48) 022 ∗∗∗ (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 001 (cid:53) Invites 0 (cid:48) 055 ∗∗ (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 024 (cid:53) Number of adopters 0 (cid:48) 607 ∗∗∗ 0 (cid:48) 360 ∗∗∗ (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 030 (cid:53) (cid:52) 0 (cid:48) 031 (cid:53) F value 3 (cid:48) 51 ∗∗∗ 4 (cid:48) 87 ∗∗∗ 83 (cid:48) 54 ∗∗∗ 128 (cid:48) 92 ∗∗∗ ( df ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 7 ) R 2 0 (cid:48) 002 0 (cid:48) 003 0 (cid:48) 07 0 (cid:48) 14 Observations 6 , 310 5 , 766 5 , 766 5 , 766 Notes .

We per - formed an additional analysis to address this alter - native explanation . Application use by peer adopters is a reasonable proxy for their satisfaction with the product—the extent to which their expecta - tions regarding the product conform to the product they actually received upon adoption . We therefore examined the application use of peers that adopted through response to a viral message and divided them into two groups : those that received ( through random assignment ) a version of the product with the ability to send viral messages of the type they received from their inﬂuencing peer and those who received a version of the product without the ability to send viral messages of the type they received from their inﬂuencing peer . T - tests show that use of the application by those who received the features they would have expected to receive and those that were “disappointed” ( so to speak ) by not receiving the fea - tures they would have expected to receive show no signiﬁcant differences in application use ( t = 0 (cid:48) 9054 ; SD = 8 (cid:48) 0377 ) . It is therefore unlikely that adoption and Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS 1633 use are explained by expected utility from the exis - tence of viral features . Fourth , other omitted variables ( such as unob - served user heterogeneity ) could create a spurious correlation between peer adoption and use . How - ever , our data also rule out this possibility . Because feature inclusion is randomized , the distribution of any unobserved covariates must be the same across treatment groups , and so omitted variables cannot produce the discrepancy in peer adoption and appli - cation use across treatment groups shown in Figure 2 , ( a ) and ( c ) . There could be an unobserved covariate that must ﬁrst be activated by the existence of a fea - ture to drive peer adoption and application use ; how - ever , that too is unsupported by the evidence . Because we observe correlation between adoption and use beyond that which is explained by use of the invite and notiﬁcations features themselves ( see Table 7 ) , it seems unlikely that a user characteristic that simulta - neously drives peer adoption and use would be acti - vated by a viral feature that users do not use . The only remaining explanations are depicted in Figure 3 , ( g ) and ( h ) , which captures both demand effects ( features drive use ) and network externalities ( peer adoption drives use ) . Given our analyses , net - work externalities are at least in part responsible for driving application use . But , this is a conservative interpretation of the evidence . Because we have ruled out most of the plausible demand effect explanations ( that features drive use in one of several ways we have considered ) , it is likely that network effects are entirely responsible for the increased application use we observe among treated users . Another piece of evidence corroborating network effects is that the hazard rate of adoption is increasing over adoption events , implying a reinforcement effect of prior adoptions on the likelihood of future adop - tion ( Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004 ) . The hazard rate of adoption increases faster than exponentially for the ﬁrst several adoption events , then more slowly , suggesting that reinforcement is approximately con - stant over peer adoptions ( see Table 6 and Figure 4 ) . Although we interpret this piece of evidence with caution because “one cannot distinguish between con - tagion and heterogeneity only on the basis of statis - tical properties of the distributional form” ( Taibleson 1974 , p . 878 ) , the fact that the hazard rate of adoption is increasing with each subsequent adoption event k is consistent with a reinforcement effect of prior adop - tions on future adoption . Finally , Table 8 presents correlates of application diffusion that corroborate results of the randomized trial . Models 4 – 6 conﬁrm that peers of initial adopters also use the application because diffusion depth depends on peers’ ( and peers of peers ) application Figure 4 Baseline Hazards (cid:52)(cid:139) 0 k (cid:53) for k = 1 (cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) 6 Fitted to an Exponential and a Power Function k 1 0 0 . 01 0 . 02 0 . 03 0 . 04 0 . 05 0 . 06 0 . 07 0 . 08 0 . 09 0 . 10 2 3 4 5 6 (cid:1) 0 k y = 0 . 0002e 1 . 1785 x R 2 = 0 . 8956 y = 0 . 0002 x 3 . 4939 R 2 = 0 . 9875 use . Active - personalized and passive - broadcast treat - ments signiﬁcantly increase average diffusion depth , and these effects are again explained by applica - tion use and the viral features themselves ( Model 6 ) . Results in Model 3 also corroborate hazard model estimates , conﬁrming that invitations are on average three times more effective per message in inspiring peer adoption than notiﬁcations . Taken together , evi - dence of a strong correlation between the number of adopter friends and application use and the distribu - tional properties of the baseline hazards of adoption events suggest that network externalities accelerate contagion . As more of a user’s friends adopt , they use the application more , creating a positive feedback loop . 6 . Discussion These results have broad implications for managers attempting to promote viral product diffusion and for theories of social contagion , opinion leadership , and viral product design . We discuss several of the broad implications of our ﬁndings for managers and future research on peer inﬂuence , social contagion , and viral marketing . First , our estimates imply that viral product design may be more effective in encouraging new product adoption than traditional marketing strategies . Noti - ﬁcations and invites , which produced 1 % and 10 % conversion rates ( CRs ) , respectively , vastly outper - form the ad campaign used in our recruitment phase on Facebook , which produced a 0 . 01 % conversion rate . Because Facebook currently has the largest mar - ket share of display advertising on the Web , these comparisons reﬂect the relative performance of viral product design and the lion’s share of Web - based display advertising ( Tucker 2010 ) .

This table reports ordinary least squares parameter estimates for linear estimating equations regressing the number of adopters ( deﬁned in Table 3 ) and diffusion depth ( the maximum network distance from a treated user to any peer adopter in a linked chain of adoptions ) on the variables listed . See Table 7 for all additional notes and variable deﬁnitions . invites also outperform the CR in paid search adver - tising , which has been estimated at 0 . 02 % ( Ghose and Yang 2009 ) . Although conversion rates are typ - ically signiﬁcantly smaller than click - through rates ( CTRs ) , the CRs for notiﬁcations and invites even outperform published statistics on CTRs for tradi - tional banner advertising ( outside of Facebook ) and e - mail marketing campaigns . The 1 % CR on notiﬁ - cations outperforms the CTRs for traditional banner advertising ( which range from 0 . 10 % – 0 . 20 % in pub - licly available statistics ) , and invitations are 10 times as effective at generating conversions as traditional banner ads are at generating click - throughs . Com - pared to e - mail campaign CTRs ( which range from 2 % to 6 % in publicly available statistics ) , invitations are again more effective at a 10 % conversion rate . 5 These comparisons show viral channels to be more effective at generating higher response rates than traditional digital advertising channels . We also asked the directors of the ﬁrm with whom we partnered about their feature implementa - tion and customer acquisition costs and learned that invites can be implemented for a total cost under 5 Click - through rates on banner ads have declined from 0 . 33 % to 0 . 19 % from 2004 through 2008 ( Riley 2009 ) ; DoubleClick ( 2009 ) reports that in 2008 , the average CTR in the United States was 0 . 10 % for banner ads . For e - mail campaigns , the estimated CTR in 2008 and 2009 remained stable at 5 . 9 % ( Epsilon 2009 ) , whereas MailerMailer ( 2010 ) reports the average CTR on e - mail campaigns at 2 . 80 % , and WebMarketCentral ( 2007 ) reports a 2 % – 3 % CTR . $ 600 . Because implementing viral features incurs a low one - time ﬁxed cost , and the expected return is proportional to the increase in adopters the fea - ture generates , viral product design may be a more cost - effective strategy than increasing spending on traditional digital advertising ( which incurs costs pro - portional to impressions or clicks ) . It may be , how - ever , that the success of viral product design efforts depends on traditional advertising to the extent that an initial base of users is needed to implement viral marketing . It is also important to consider the social cost of viral messages . Bombarding users with mes - sages from peers may reduce the overall quality of the user experience . Future work should estimate the costs of viral product design more comprehensively and consider the implications of both marginal rev - enue and marginal cost on optimal product design . Second , given that active - personalized features are more marginally effective but less globally effective than passive - broadcast features , a natural question is how managers can optimize the effectiveness of these viral features . Because the main limitation of active - personalized features is that high effort costs curtail their use , one solution may be to couple active - personalized features with referral incentives that encourage their use ( Biyalogorsky et al . 2001 ) . Opti - mally designed incentive strategies could encourage users to generate more personalized referrals and to target and personalize viral messages more effectively ( Aral et al . 2011 ) . It may also be possible to improve the low marginal effectiveness of passive - broadcast Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS 1635 features by automatically targeting and personaliz - ing broadcast messages algorithmically . If there is a social cost to viral messages , product and platform developers could seek to limit impersonal messages in adaptive ways that are tied to the effectiveness of the messages themselves . Third , the combination of viral features and net - work externalities seems to drive a positive feed - back loop in which product use drives peer adoption , and peer adoption in turn drives product use . If so , managers should seek to enable this feedback loop by designing both viral features and strong direct and indirect network externalities into their products . Maximizing engagement and minimizing churn may be obvious goals , but the combined effects of engage - ment and contagion on product diffusion are less obvious . Interactions between network externalities , sustained use , and customer churn may change over a product’s life cycle and may vary across products . More work on the relationships between social conta - gion , sustained use , and customer churn over prod - ucts and product life cycles will help clarify when viral marketing is most effective . 7 . Conclusion We conducted a large - scale randomized experiment testing the effectiveness of viral product design fea - tures in creating social contagion . We found that viral product design has econometrically identiﬁable impacts on peer inﬂuence and social contagion in new product diffusion . Results of our randomized trial suggest that designing viral features into prod - ucts can increase social contagion by up to 400 % . Sur - prisingly , designing products with passive - broadcast viral messaging capabilities generates more total peer inﬂuence and social contagion than adding active - personalized viral messaging capabilities . Although active - personalized messaging is more effective in encouraging adoption per message and is correlated with more user engagement and sustained product use , it is used less often , and therefore generates less total peer adoption in the network . Data on the distri - butional form of the diffusion process and on product use are consistent with the existence of positive net - work externalities that reinforce peer adoption and create a virtuous cycle of engagement and contagion . Understanding optimal viral product design strate - gies , taking into account factors such as sustained product use , network externalities , social and eco - nomic costs , incentives , and the marginal effective - ness of different viral features could enable ﬁrms to optimally create and manage social contagion . The difﬁculty , however , is in determining what works and what does not . Numerous statistical challenges prevent clean causal estimation of the relationships between interventions and outcomes and the likely effects of changes in product design and platform policy . Fortunately , IT - based products and platforms provide natural vehicles for randomized experimen - tation . Given the low cost of conducting experiments , the rapid development and testing of viral design features , and the winner - take - all nature of markets with network externalities , this type of experimenta - tion is likely to increase in the future and eventually to become commonplace in the development of many products and platforms . Our work sheds light on how viral products can be designed to generate social con - tagion and offers a template for using randomized trials to identify peer inﬂuence in networks .

Appendix Inside - Out Design Randomized trials are traditionally used to estimate the effect of a treatment on the treated . To study the effect of viral feature incorporation on product adoption out - comes , we instead examined the effect of treatment on the peers of treated application users . The difference in these approaches is illustrated in Figure A . 1 . Arrows indicate the potential ﬂow of inﬂuence that the experiment is designed to detect . The solid blue circle in the center represents the treated user , and the red outlines indicate measurements of treatment effects . In social network environments , a conven - tional approach is infeasible because it is difﬁcult to com - prehensively control the network environments of each user in the study population . It is feasible , however , to treat a user and observe the effect of treatment on the outcomes of their peers . The strength of our approach lies in its ability to capture effects of any form of inﬂuence - mediating communication channels between the treated user and her peers , including effects that arise through inﬂuence - mediating communica - tion channels beyond those that can be explicitly recorded . For example , treated users could communicate with and Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design 1636 Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS Figure A . 1 Inside - Out Experimental Design Conventional approach Our approach inﬂuence their peers through ofﬂine interactions such as face - to - face communications or telephone conversations , as well as through unrecorded online communications such as e - mail or external chat conversations . Because we measure the response of peers regardless of how they may or may not have been inﬂuenced by treated users , we are able to capture the effect of unrecorded inﬂuence - mediating com - munications on peer adoption . Preventing Selection Effects Selection effects could occur when a user chooses to adopt the experimental application through the recruitment campaign or when they adopt in response to a viral mes - sage . We took steps to mitigate and measure both possi - bilities . The recruitment campaign was designed to reach a representative audience of Facebook users , and advertise - ments were displayed to users through advertising space within Facebook and within existing Facebook applica - tions . Establishing to what extent the recruited popula - tion is representative of the general Facebook population is somewhat challenging because Facebook does not ofﬁ - cially publish demographic statistics of their user base . However , through the use of a recently released social targeting advertisement service provided by Facebook , it is possible to obtain some ofﬁcial demographic statistics . Age and gender demographics sampled through this application programming interface and published online by istrategy - labs . com are comparable to the same demographic ranges for recruited study population users in Figure A . 2 . Though our sample has a slightly higher percentage of women than the Facebook population , and users in our sample have a slightly higher average degree ( 150 compared with 130 in Facebook statistics ) , the demographics of our study pop - ulation are comparable to those of the broader Facebook Figure A . 2 Comparison of Sample and Population Demographic Characteristics 13 – 17 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 ( % ) 90 100 18 – 24 25 – 34 35 – 54 55 + Male Female Facebook population Study sample population , and the published Facebook demographics fall within one standard deviation of study population sample means . In addition to issues of selection surrounding the popula - tion of recruited users , application users that adopt because of peer inﬂuence may be subject to selection effects and may be fundamentally different from application users that adopted via initial recruitment . It could be that users who use the viral features and peers of users who use viral fea - tures are systematically different from randomly selected Facebook users . We avoid these sources of selection bias in our analyses by only considering initially recruited users in the randomized treatment group to which they were assigned . Peers of recruited users only contribute to local network peer adoption of originally recruited users and are not themselves used as test subjects . Preventing Leakage and Contamination In randomized trials in network environments , users assigned to different treatment groups may not be strictly isolated from one another . This raises the concern that infor - mation leakage through indirect network pathways may contaminate the results of the study . It is important to note that in traditional studies , whether or not the network is measured , relationships may still exist between treatment and control populations that create leakage effects . One ben - eﬁt of our design is that we systematically observe how individuals in the study are connected , enabling us to mea - sure and prevent leakage . Several factors reduce the likelihood that leakage is affect - ing our results . First , because treatment assignment is ran - domized , any leakage will be uncorrelated with treatment assignment and cannot account for the observed differences in responses to treatments . Although it is possible that leak - age will on average provide some common information to peers of treated users uniformly across the treatment desig - nations , this effect should only serve to make our estimates across treatment groups more conservative , because leakage should reduce differences between control and treatment groups . Second , information ﬂows between individuals in a network typically decay rapidly with network distance ( Wu et al . 2004 , Aral et al . 2007 ) . Although all users may be con - nected through long friendship paths , leakage will diminish over successive hops in each path . Nonetheless , leakage effects could downward bias our estimates of treatment effects toward zero , and we therefore Aral and Walker : Creating Social Contagion Through Viral Product Design Management Science 57 ( 9 ) , pp . 1623 – 1639 , ©2011 INFORMS 1637 Figure A . 3 Preventing Contamination and Leakage Treatment 1 group Treatment 2 group Treatment 1 group Treatment 2 group A peer with multiple treated friends in the same treatment groups A peer with multiple treated friends in different treatment groups take several steps to prevent leakage . First , in hazard rate models , we examine only peers of initially recruited adopters . In addition to avoiding potential selection issues mentioned above , this also excludes individuals ( and their potential adopter peers ) that adopt in chains within a local neighborhood , lessening leakage effects . Such individuals are likely to share more and shorter indirect paths with existing adopters than a randomly chosen peer , as a conse - quence of clustering and mutuality ( Newman 2003 ) . Second , we account for users with multiple treated peers ( of similar and / or different treatments ) . Existence of peers of multiple treated application users leads to two potential complications . First , users may be peers of multiple treated users from different treatment groups , making it impossible to link their treatment effects to a single treatment . Second , peers of multiple treated users that belong to the same treatment group are clearly classiﬁed as peers of either base - line , active - personalized , or passive - broadcast users ; how - ever , measurements of their response may be incorrectly estimated as a consequence of being subject to inﬂuence from multiple treated friends . A peer with multiple treated friends in a given viral treatment group may exhibit an adoption outcome or time to adoption that is systematically different from those of peers with only one treated friend . These two scenarios are displayed in Figure A . 3 . The nature of treatment randomization does not allow us to simultaneously guarantee that all treated friends of a peer will receive the same treatment . Consequently we treat peers with multiple treated friends as contaminated as soon as they become so and exclude them from our analysis . This procedure could underestimate the effect of clusters of adoption on the time to adoption or number of adopters in a local network neighborhood ; however , if this is the case , it will do so in a manner that is the same for all treatment types . Furthermore , because treatment groups are random - ized , there can be no systematic correlation between the type of treatment received by a user and that received by her subsequent adopter peer . The procedure that we adopt for designating a peer as contaminated is detailed in Figure A . 4 . The initially recruited adopter , labeled R , adopts at time t 0 . Two peers of user R , labeled 1 and 2 , adopt at subsequent times t 1 and t 2 , respectively . In panel ( a ) , for times t > t 1 , peer 2 has multiple treated peers ( R and 1 ) that may have been assigned different treatments . Peer 2 is therefore consid - ered contaminated for times t > t 1 . In panel ( b ) , a sim - ilar situation occurs , but no link exists between peers 1 Figure A . 4 Procedure for Designating Contaminated Peers 1 2 R t 0 t 1 t 2 t 0 < t 1 < t 2 t 0 < t 1 < t 2 ( a ) 1 2 R t 0 t 1 t 2 ( b ) and 2 , and consequently neither user is considered con - taminated . In our analysis , when a peer is designated as contaminated , she is removed from the hazard rate model for subsequent time periods . This procedure appropriately retains the maximal empirical support for hazard rate esti - mation and parameterizes our ignorance of what might happen subsequent to a user’s contamination . The right censoring of contaminated subjects has become standard practice in randomized clinical trials where a patient in a randomized treatment group undergoes some characteristic change that is beyond the researcher’s control . Furthermore , by including right - censored observations in our data rather than truncating the data , we avoid problems caused by data truncation that could lead to spurious evidence of contagion ( Van den Bulte and Iyengar 2011 ) . 6 We note that the exclusion of peers with multiple treated friends does not preclude measurement of network exter - nalities . Peers of treated users that become adopters but are not connected are considered uncontaminated and are included in our analysis . For two peers of a treated user that are connected and eventually become adopters , the initial peer adopter is included in our analysis , and only the peer that subsequently adopts is considered contaminated and excluded for all times subsequent to contamination . These procedures enable a tightly controlled randomized trial of peer inﬂuence that addresses the potential for selection and leakage effects . Robustness Checks for Different Hazard Model Speciﬁcations There are a limited number of survival models that apply to contexts with multiple failures . Among these models , the variance - corrected stratiﬁed proportional hazards model reported in this paper is the most appropriate speciﬁca - tion given the structure of our data and the parameters we estimate . However , we also checked multiple other hazard model speciﬁcations to test the robustness of our results to changes in model speciﬁcation and estimation strategy . 6 An alternative to dealing with users who have multiple adopter friends belonging to different treatment groups would be to ascribe peer adoption outcomes to inﬂuence from the adopter friend in the viral treatment group with the fewest viral features ( above the baseline ) . However , we do not know a priori that inclusion of a viral feature does not have a negative impact on peer adoption outcomes ( for example , if peers view viral messages as spam ) . To ascribe users with multiple adopter friends as peers of the lowest viral treatment group could upwardly or downwardly bias esti - mates of lower viral treatment effectiveness . It is therefore cleaner to remove contaminated users altogether .

For good reviews of appropriate speciﬁcations of survival models in multiple failure data , we recommend Wei and Glidden ( 1997 ) and Ezell et al . ( 2003 ) . Table A . 1 reports results of different hazard model spec - iﬁcations , all of which are similar to our own . We report the original variance - corrected stratiﬁed proportional haz - ards model speciﬁcation detailed in this paper in column 1 . Column 2 reports an accelerated failure time model with a log - logistic survival distribution . Column 3 reports an exponential regression with log relative - hazard form . Col - umn 4 reports results from a traditional Andersen and Gill ( 1982 ) model . Column 5 introduces a time - dependent covariate measuring the number of prior adopters to the traditional Andersen – Gill speciﬁcation to capture the dependence structure among recurrence times , which in our original model is captured by the adoption event strata k . Column 6 reports a Prentice et al . ( 1981 ) proportional haz - ards speciﬁcation with time dependent strata . Finally , col - umn 7 reports results of a Wei et al . ( 1989 ) marginal risk set model . We note that all speciﬁcations produce similar results . However , we are most conﬁdent in our original speciﬁcation , which is best suited to our context and data . References Andersen , P . K . , R . D . Gill . 1982 .
