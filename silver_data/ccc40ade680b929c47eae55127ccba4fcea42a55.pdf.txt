Three - dimensional ( 3D ) nanoscale - resolution imaging , however , remains a challenge . We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy . Iterative , stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high - precision 3D localization of each probe , and thus the construction of a 3D image , without scanning the sample . Using this approach , we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension . This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures . F ar - field optical microscopy offers three - dimensional ( 3D ) imaging of biological specimens with minimal perturbation and biomolecular specificity when combined with fluorescent labeling . These advantages make fluorescence microscopy one of the most widely used imaging methods in biology . The diffraction barrier , however , limits the imaging resolution of conventional light microscopy to 200 to 300 nm in the lateral dimensions , leaving many intracellular organelles and molecular structures unresolvable . Recently , the diffraction limit has been surpassed and lateral imaging resolutions of 20 to 50 nm have been achieved by several “ super - resolution ” far - field microsco - py techniques , including stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) and its related RESOLFT ( reversible saturable optically linear fluorescent transitions ) microscopy ( 1 , 2 ) ; saturated struc - tured illumination microscopy ( SSIM ) ( 3 ) ; stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) ( 4 , 5 ) ; photoactivated localization mi - croscopy ( PALM ) ( 6 , 7 ) ; and other methods using similar principles ( 8 – 10 ) . Although these techniques have improved 2D imageresolution , mostorganellesandcellularstruc - tures cannot be resolved without high - resolution imaginginallthreedimensions . Three - dimensional fluorescence imaging is most commonly per - formed using confocal or multiphoton microsco - py , the axial resolution of which is typically in the range of 500 to 800 nm ( 11 , 12 ) . The axial imag - ingresolution can be improved to roughly100 nm by 4Pi and I 5 M microscopy ( 13 – 15 ) . Further - more , an axial resolution as high as 30 to 50 nm has been obtained with STED along the axial direction using the 4Pi illumination geometry , but the same imaging scheme does not provide super resolution in the lateral dimensions ( 1 ) . Here , we demonstrate 3D STORM imag - ing with a spatial resolution that is 10 times better than the diffraction limit in all three di - mensions without invoking sample or optical - beam scanning . STORM and PALM rely on single - molecule detection ( 16 ) and exploit the photoswitchable nature of certain fluorophores to temporally separate the otherwise spatially overlapping images of numerous molecules , thereby allowing the high - precision localiza - tion of individual molecules ( 4 – 7 , 9 ) . Limited only by the number of photons detected ( 17 ) , localization accuracies as high as 1 nm can be achieved in the lateral dimensions for a single fluorescent dye at ambient conditions ( 18 ) . Not only can the lateral position of a particle be de - termined from the centroid of its image ( 19 , 20 ) , the shape of the image also contains information about the particle ’ s axial ( z ) position . Nanoscale localization accuracy has been achieved in the z dimension by introducing defocusing ( 21 – 24 ) or astigmatism ( 25 , 26 ) into the image , without substantially compromising the lateral posi - tioning capability . In this work , we used the astigmatism imaging method to achieve 3D STORM imag - ing . To this end , a weak cylindrical lens was introduced into the imaging path to create two slightly different focal planes for the x and y directions ( Fig . 1A ) ( 25 , 26 ) . As a result , the ellipticity and orientation of a fluorophore ’ s image varied as its position changed in z ( Fig . 1A ) : When the fluorophore was in the average focal plane [ approximately halfway between the x and y focal planes where the point spread function ( PSF ) has equal widths in the x and y directions ] , the image appeared round ; when the fluorophore was above the average focal plane , its image was more focused in the y direction than in the x direction and thus appeared ellipsoidal with its long axis along x ; conversely , when the fluorophore was below the average focal plane , the image appeared ellipsoidal with its long axis along y . By fitting the image with a 2D elliptical Gaussian function , we obtained the x and y coordinates of the peak position as well as the peak widths w x and w y , which in turn allowed the z coordinate of the fluorophore to be unambiguously determined . Toexperimentallygeneratea calibration curve of w x and w y as a function of z , we immobilized Alexa647 – labeledstreptavidinmoleculesorquan - tum dots on a glass surface and imaged individ - ual molecules to determine the w x and w y values as the sample was scanned in z ( Fig . 1B ) . In 3D STORM analysis , the z coordinate of each photo - activatedfluorophorewasthendeterminedbycom - paring the measured w x and w y values of its image with the calibration curves . In addition , for sam - ples immersed in aqueous solution on a glass sub - strate , all z localizations were rescaled by a factor 1 Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Harvard University , Cam - bridge , MA02138 , USA . 2 DepartmentofChemistryandChem - ical Biology , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA 02138 , USA . 3 Department of Physics , Harvard University , Cam - bridge , MA02138 , USA . 4 SchoolofEngineeringandApplied Sciences , Harvard University , Cambridge , MA 02138 , USA . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

The 3D resolution of STORM is limited by the accuracy with which individual photoacti - vated fluorophores can be localized in all three dimensions during a switching cycle . We re - cently discovered a family of photoswitchable cyanine dyes ( Cy5 , Cy5 . 5 , Cy7 , and Alexa 647 ) that can be reversibly cycled between a fluo - rescent and a dark state by light of different wavelengths . The reactivation efficiency of these photoswitchable “ reporters ” depends critically on the proximity of an “ activator ” dye , which can be any one of a variety of dye molecules ( e . g . , Cy3 , Cy2 , Alexa 405 ) ( 5 , 28 ) . We used Cy3 and Alexa 647 as the activator and reporter pair to perform 3D STORM imaging . A red laser ( 657 nm ) was used to image Alexa 647 molecules and deactivate them to the dark state ; a green laser ( 532 nm ) was used to reactivate Alexa 647 Fig . 1 . The scheme of 3D STORM .

Each activator - reporter pair could be cycled on and off hundreds of times before permanent photo - bleaching occurred . An average of 6000 photons were detected per switching cycle by means of objective - type total internal reflection fluorescence or epifluorescence imaging ge - ometry . This reversible switching behavior provided an internal control to measure the localization accuracy . To this end , we immobi - lized streptavidin molecules doubly labeled with Cy3 and Alexa 647 on a glass surface ( 27 ) . The molecules were then switched on and off for multiple cycles , and their x , y , and z coordinates were determined for each switching cycle ( 27 ) . This procedure resulted in a cluster of local - izations for each molecule ( Fig . 1C ) . The standard deviations of the localization dis - tribution obtained within 100 nm of the average focal plane were 9 nm in x , 11 nm in y , and 22 nm in z , and the corresponding full width at half maximum ( FWHM ) values were 21 nm , 26 nm , and 52 nm , providing a quantitative measure of the localization accuracy in 3D ( Fig . 1C ) . The localization accuracies in the two lateral dimen - sions were similar to our previous 2D STORM resolution obtained without the cylindrical lens ( 5 ) . The localization accuracy in z was approx - imately twice the localization accuracy mea - sured in x and y . Because the image width increases as the fluorophore moves away from the focal plane , the localization accuracy de - creases with increasing absolute values of z , especially in the lateral dimensions . Therefore , we typically chose a z imaging depth of about 600 nm near the focal plane , within which the lateral and axial localization accuracies varied by factors of < 1 . 6 and < 1 . 3 , respectively , rela - tive to the values obtained at the average focal plane . The imaging depth may , however , be increased by the use of z scanning in future experiments . As an initial test of 3D STORM , we imaged a model bead sample prepared by immobilizing 200 - nm biotinylated polystyrene beads on a glass surface and then incubating the sample with Cy3 - and Alexa 647 – labeled streptavidin to coat the beads with photoswitchable probes ( 27 ) . Three - dimensional STORM images of the beads were obtained by iterative , stochastic activation of sparse subsets of optically resolv - able Alexa 647 molecules , allowing the x , y , and z coordinates of individual molecules to be determined . Over the course of multiple activa - tion cycles , the positions of numerous fluoro - phores were determined and used to construct a full 3D image ( 27 ) . The projections of the bead images appeared approximately spherical when viewed along all three directions , with average diameters of 210 ± 16 , 225 ± 25 , and 228 ± 25 nm in x , y , and z , respectively ( fig . S1 ) ( 27 ) , indicating accurate localization in all three dimensions . Because the image of each fluo - rophore simultaneously encodes its x , y , and z coordinates , no additional time was required to localize each molecule in 3D STORM as com - pared with 2D STORM imaging . Applying 3D STORM to cell imaging , we next performed indirect immunofluorescence imaging of the microtubule network in green monkey kidney epithelial ( BS - C - 1 ) cells . Cells were immunostained with primary antibodies and then with secondary antibodies doubly la - beled with Cy3 and Alexa 647 ( 27 ) . The 3D STORM image not only showed a substantial improvement in resolution over the conventional wide - field fluorescence image ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) , but also provided the z - dimension information ( color - coded in Fig . 2B ) that was not available in the conventional image .

To characterize our cell imaging resolution more quantitatively , we identified point - like ob - jects in the cell that appeared as small clusters of localizations away from any discernible micro - tubule filaments . These clusters likely represent individual antibodies nonspecifically attached to the cell . The FWHM values of these clusters , which were randomly chosen over the entire measured z - range of the cell , were 22 nm in x , 28 nm in y , and 55 nm in z ( fig . S2 ) ( 27 ) , similar to those determined for individual molecules immobilized on a glass surface ( compare fig . S2 with Fig . 1C ) . Two microtubule filaments sep - arated by 100 nm in z appeared well separated in the 3D STORM image ( Fig . 2F ) . The appar - ent width of the microtubule filaments in the z dimension was 66 nm , slightly larger than our intrinsic imaging resolution in z and in quanti - tative agreement with the convolution of the imaging resolution and the independently mea - sured width of the antibody - coated microtubule ( Fig . 2F ) . Because the effective resolution is determined by a combination of the intrinsic imaging resolution ( as characterized above ) and the size of the labels ( e . g . , antibodies ) , improved resolution may be achieved by using direct im - munofluorescence to remove one layer of anti - body labeling , as we show in the next example , or by using Fab fragments or genetically encoded peptide tags ( 29 , 30 ) in place of antibodies . Finally , to demonstrate that 3D STORM can resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic struc - turesincells , weimagedclathrin - coatedpits ( CCPs ) inBS - C - 1cells . CCPsaresphericalcage - likestruc - tures , about150to200nminsize , assembledfrom clathrin and cofactors on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane to facilitate endocytosis ( 31 ) . To image CCPs , we adopted a direct immunofluo - rescence scheme using primary antibodies against clathrin doubly labeled with Cy3 and Alexa 647 ( 27 ) . When imaged by conventional fluorescence microscopy , all CCPs appeared as nearly diffraction - limited spots with no discern - ible structure ( Fig . 3A ) . In 2D STORM images in which the z - dimension information was dis - carded , the round shape of CCPs was clearly seen ( Fig . 3 , B and D ) . The size distribution of CCPs measured from the 2D projection image , 180 ± 40 nm , agrees quantitatively with the size distribution determined using electron microsco - py ( EM ) ( 32 ) . Including the z - dimension information allowed us to clearly visualize the 3D structure of the pits ( Fig . 3 , C and E to H ) . Figures 3C and 3E show the x - y cross sections of the image , taken from a region near the opening of the pits at the cell surface . The circular ring - like structure of the pit periphery was unambig - uously resolved . Consecutive x - y and x - z cross sections of the pits ( Fig . 3 , F to H ) clearly revealed the half - spherical cage - like morphology of these nanoscopic structures that was not observable in the2Dimages . Theseexperimentsdemonstratethe ability of 3D STORM to resolve nanoscopic features of cellular structures with molecular specificity under ambient conditions . References and Notes 1 . S . W .

An Association Between the Kinship and Fertility of Human Couples Agnar Helgason , 1 , 2 * Sn æ björn Pálsson , 1 , 3 Daníel F . Gu ð bjartsson , 1 Þ ór ð ur Kristjánsson , 1 Kári Stefánsson 1 , 4 Previous studies have reported that related human couples tend to produce more children than unrelated couples but have been unable to determine whether this difference is biological or stems from socioeconomic variables . Our results , drawn from all known couples of the Icelandic population born between 1800 and 1965 , show a significant positive association between kinship and fertility , with the greatest reproductive success observed for couples related at the level of third and fourth cousins . Owing to the relative socioeconomic homogeneity of Icelanders , and the observation of highly significant differences in the fertility of couples separated by very fine intervals of kinship , we conclude that this association is likely to have a biological basis . T here has been long - standing uncertainty about the impact of kinship or consan - guinity between spouses on the total num - ber of offspring they produce ( completed fertility ) . Consanguineous unions among humans increase the probability of a zygote receiving the same deleterious recessive alleles from both parents , with a possible adverse effect on fertility through an increased rate of miscarriage , infant mortality , and morbidity ( 1 – 3 ) . Conversely , consanguin - eous unions may confer greater completed fertility through earlier age at marriage , as well as the socioeconomic advantages associated with preserving land and wealth within extended families . ( 4 , 5 ) . In other species , lower fitness has been observed in offspring of distantly re - lated individuals , which appears to be a result of the breakdown of coadapted gene complexes ( 6 ) . Previous studies examining the relationship between kinship and fertility in humans have fo - cused on relatively close relationships between couples , rarely evaluating relationships more dis - tant than second cousins ( who share two great - grandparents ) ( 4 ) .
