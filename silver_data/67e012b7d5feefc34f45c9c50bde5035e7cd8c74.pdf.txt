It allows bioinformaticians to construct workflows or pipelines of services to perform a range of different analyses , such as sequence analysis and genome annotation . These high - level workflows can integrate many different resources into a single analysis .

INTRODUCTION The number of applications and databases providing tools to perform computations on DNA , RNA and proteins are rapidly growing . However , the lack of communication between such tools in molecular biology is commonly a barrier to extracting new knowledge using these resources . Many tools and databases already communicate using the web , as shown by the ever - growing list of servers in this issue of Nucleic Acids Research . Currently , integrating tools and databases available on the web frequently involves either ‘screen - scraping’ web pages using scripting languages like PERL or manual cut - and - paste of data between applications . Each of these methods has its problems . Screen - scraping is notoriously fragile , because the integrating script is prone to break when the web page or form changes , and for this reason has been likened to ‘medieval torture’ ( 1 ) . Cutting and pasting data between applications is another common way to quickly achieve interoperation . However , cut - and - paste procedures are laborious to repeat and verify . Web services technology provides some solutions for improving this situation . In addition to providing form - based interfaces , tool and database providers can describe their application or database using the standard Web Services Description Language ( WSDL ) . These WSDL descriptions can then be indexed to build a searchable and browsable registry of operations for end - users . Applications can then exchange data , typically using SOAP , a protocol for exchang - ing XML - based messages over a network , normally using HTTP . For a full description of web service technology , lan - guages and protocols see ( 2 ) . Using web services has several advantages : (cid:1) Tools and databases do not need to be installed locally on the users machine or laboratory server , as they are program - matically accessible over the web . (cid:1) Tools created using different programming languages ( e . g . Python , PERL , Java , etc . ) and platforms ( e . g . Unix , Windows , etc . ) can be accessed through the same web service interface . This removes the need for the user to know about all the different platforms and programming languages underneath . (cid:1) The need for fragile screen - scraping integration scripts is reduced . (cid:1) It provides an alternative to time - consuming and laborious ‘cut - and - paste’ integration between web applications . (cid:1) Workflows , or pipelines , of web services can be built to provide high - level descriptions of analyses . These can be created and tested relatively quickly to integrate many dif - ferent tools and applications in a single analysis However , there are also several limitations of using web services : (cid:1) Since services are provided by autonomous third - parties around the world , they frequently have insufficient or non - existent metadata . Where metadata exists it often pro - vides little indication of the purpose of a service . So for example , inputs can have cryptic names like ‘ in1 ’ with * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

In the worst case , the only way to work out what task a service performs is to invoke it with some data and examine what comes back from the service . Invoking services relies on knowing exactly what data a service takes as input , information which is not always available . An important consequence of poor service metadata is that many services can be difficult to find in a registry ( 3 ) . (cid:1) Joining services together into pipelines is frequently problematic , as the inputs and outputs are not directly com - patible . Consequently , many one - off ‘shim’ services ( 4 ) are required to align closely - related data and enable services to interoperate . (cid:1) The web services stack ( 2 ) can be difficult to debug . Standard open - source libraries that Taverna uses for creat - ing , documenting and invoking services like WSIF ( http : / / ws . apache . org / wsif / ) , WSDL4J and Axis ( http : / / ws . apache . org / axis / ) can provide poor documentation by default , and cryptic error messages when services fail . (cid:1) Services accessed over a network can have unpredict - able performance and reliability ( http : / / www . java . net / jag / Fallacies . html ) . Some services , particularly the more spe - cialist and obscure tools provided by smaller laboratories , can be unreliable , unstable or have licensing issues . Such services are often the ‘weakest link’ in the chain . When individual services fail , for whatever reason , the whole workflow can not be run . Mirrored replica or redundant services are not always available to address this problem through failover . Working with both these strengths and limitations , Taverna ( 5 , 6 ) , part of the my Grid project , is an application that makes building and executing workﬂows accessible to bioinformati - cians who are not necessarily experts in web services and programming . It provides a single point of access to a range of services with programmatic interfaces , primarly web services . As of March 2006 , there are around 3000 of these publicly available services in molecular biology , pro - vided by range of third - parties around the world . The poten - tial set of services accessible in Taverna is even larger , as more tool and database providers expose programmatic inter - faces to their resources over the web . Currently , building workﬂows of these services in Taverna , allows users glue these diverse resources together relatively quickly . This can allow rapid exploration of data of hypothesis testing , e . g . on given gene ( s ) or protein ( s ) . SERVICES AND WORKFLOWS TAVERNA There are a wide range of services available in Taverna , ﬁrst those provided by INSDC ( http : / / www . insdc . org / ) member organizations , EMBL - EBI provides standard services ( 7 ) , the NCBI Entrez Programming Utilities ( NCBI services can only be used in Taverna version 1 . 3 . 2 - RC1 or later ) ( 8 ) and the DNA Databank of Japan ( DDBJ ) ( 9 ) . Additional tools and databases are provided by the Protein Databank of Japan ( PDBJ ) ( 10 ) , Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Gen - omes ( KEGG ) ( 11 ) , BioMART ( 12 ) , PathPort / ToolBus tools ( 13 ) , BioMOBY ( 14 ) , BIND ( 15 ) , SeqVista ( 16 ) and Pfam ( 17 ) from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute . A more comprehensive list and description of the services avail - able can be found at the sourceforge website ( http : / / taverna . sourceforge . net / index . php ? doc = services . html ) . An important feature of Taverna is that it can talk to many different kinds of service , so for example , different services can be added to the services panel . A workﬂow built from some of the services described above , which illustrates the capabilities of Taverna is shown in Figure 1 . This workﬂow starts with an input GenBank identiﬁer ( GI number ) , to retrieve a draft DNA sequence which is then fed into RepeatMasker ( http : / / www . repeatmasker . org / ) then GenScan ( http : / / genes . mit . edu / GENSCAN . html . ) ( 18 ) to predict the location of any genes in the sequence . The report output from GenScan is split , and the part containing the peptide sequence is fed into BLASTp , hosted by the DDBJ . Although not shown in this workﬂow , the results of the BLAST analysis could be fed into further programs , provided that the user knows how to parse BLAST records and what services could follow . As the services have very little metadata , Taverna cannot cur - rently guide the user during workﬂow construction . The workﬂow shown here is a basic gene prediction and charac - terization pipeline that is part of many workﬂows created in Taverna , e . g . workﬂows used inresearch of Williams – Beuren syndrome ( 19 ) and Graves disease ( 20 ) . RUNNING WORKFLOWS The workﬂow shown in Figure 1 can be downloaded from the my Grid workﬂow repository ( http : / / workﬂows . mygrid . org . uk / repository / narweb . xml . ) In order to run this worklfow , which takes > 5 min to execute , download Taverna and Figure 1 .

W730 Nucleic Acids Research , 2006 , Vol . 34 , Web Server issue consult the user documentation ( http : / / taverna . sourceforge . net / usermanual / docs . word . html ) under the heading ‘Enacting a predeﬁned workﬂow’ . Other pre - deﬁned workﬂows can be run by browsing the workﬂow repository or examples direc - tory of Taverna . Alternatively , arbitrary workﬂows can be constructed using the services described above , again see the user documentation for details . Each Taverna workﬂow can have metadata stored inside it using the author and title tags . Additional workﬂow metadata can be stored seperately from the workﬂow and identiﬁed using a Life Science Identiﬁer ( LSID ) ( 21 ) . All workﬂows have an LSID by default , although the user has to assign metadata to this LSID if they require it . TAVERNA USERS AND FUTURE WORK The current version of Taverna , ( 1 . x ) has been downloaded around 14 000 ( http : / / taverna . sourcesforge . net / index . php ? doc = stats . php ) times and has an estimated user base of around 1500 installations . Taverna has been used several different areas of research throught Europe , Asia , Australia and the USA for functional genomics ( 19 , 20 ) , metabolic and signal - ling pathway analysis ( 5 ) and chemoinformatics ( 22 ) . Based on the experiences of these users , requirements have been gathered for the next release of Taverna , version 2 . 0 . This version is currently being developed and is scheduled for release in 2007 . Planned new features include the ability to support higher - throughput and longer - running workﬂows using Grid technology , a semantically enabled registry with services annotated with terms from a standard ontology , facilities for provenance gathering and a repository of work - ﬂows that can be re - used and re - purposed . Taverna 2 . 0 will also have enhanced results browsing with the ability to incre - mentally execute workﬂows and use microarray tools like maxD ( 23 ) and the R library ( 24 ) . CONCLUSIONS We present here an application , Taverna , that allow users who are not necessarily expert programmers to design , execute and share workﬂows of web services . These workﬂows can be used to perform a range of different anal - yses in molecular biology and bioinformatics , accessing numerous different databases and tools using standard web protocols .
