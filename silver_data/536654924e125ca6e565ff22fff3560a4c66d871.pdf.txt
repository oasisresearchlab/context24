We hypothesized that the regulatory features underlying causal variants are biologically specific , identifiable from data , and that the regulatory architecture that influences one trait is distinct compared to biologically unrelated traits . To better characterize and identify these variants , we used publicly available GWAS loci and genomic annotations to build 17 Trait Specific Annotation Based Locus ( TSABL ) predictors to identify differences between GWAS loci associated with different phenotypic trait groups . We used a penalized binomial logistic regression model to select trait relevant annotations and tested all models on a holdout set of loci not used for training in any trait . We were able to successfully build models for autoimmune , electrocardiogram , lipid , platelet , red blood cell , and white blood cell trait groups . We used these models both to prioritize variants in existing loci and to identify new genomic regions of interest . We found that TSABL models identified biologically relevant regulatory features , and anticipate their future use to enhance the design and interpretation of genetic studies . .

Introduction : Genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) are a widely used method to identify genomic regions associated in a population with a phenotype of interest , and have successfully detected thousands of loci across the human genome , each of which contains at least one causal variant 1 – 16 . Unfortunately , identifying the causal variant ( s ) and underlying mechanism at associated loci is far more challenging , and for many genomic regions there exist more potential causal variants in credible sets than can be experimentally tested 17 – 19 . While trans - ancestry fine - mapping can help to narrow the set of putative variants 20 , this approach is limited to loci which share genetic architecture and genetic variation across populations , and still may not resolve causal variant ( s ) within a locus . Therefore , an orthogonal method for prioritizing variants in GWAS loci would be beneficial . Additionally , as more well - powered GWAS reveal more loci , a straightforward method to prioritize the likelihood of variants contributing to a specific disease will aid in locus discovery . While pleiotropy is pervasive across the human genome 21 , the contribution of individual variants depends on the biological relatedness of the traits under consideration . For example , the loci , causal genes , and variants associated with circulating plasma lipid levels might reasonably be expected to differ from those that modify electrocardiogram ( ECG ) traits , as the biological basis for these traits involve different tissues ( liver vs . heart ) , different physiologies ( lipid metabolism and trafficking vs . cardiac electric conductance ) , and different genes ( e . g . , SORT1 22 vs . NOS1AP 23 ) . Presumably , then , with sufficient association data and a diverse and dense collection of functional annotations across the genome , it might be possible to train a model to predict loci – and perhaps even variants – that relate to specific sets of traits relative to all others . Ideally , such a predictor would learn and select biologically relevant annotations from a set of all possible genomics features , thereby also providing informative hypotheses for why particular loci or variants are predicted to be “trait - relevant” . Current methods to predict if a variant is likely functional for any trait ( such as CADD 24 , GWAVA 25 , and DeepSEA 26 ) provide a score based on likelihood of function across multiple ( unrelated ) phenotypes and diseases . Previously , we built platelet and red blood cell models using those GWAS as positives and random matched genomic regions as controls 27 . While this was successful , we found the models to not be trait selective . Here , we instead sought to develop a trait specific annotation based locus ( TSABL ) predictor which would discriminate loci associated with a specific trait ( or collection of related traits ) from all other complex trait associated loci identified by GWAS . We collected association results from 42 GWAS - scanned phenotypes 1 – 16 , coarsely grouping them into 17 related trait groups to test and validate prediction models ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . We then applied a penalized binomial logistic regression model ( LASSO ) to each trait group using publicly available genome wide features such as DNase hypersensitivity and histone or transcription factor ChIP - seq ( Supplementary Table 2 ) , along with gene expression , phastCon score , and size of locus . The six successful TSABL models were able to separate regions associated with their trait group from other GWAS loci and identified sensible biological features for the phenotypes in focus . We then applied these models to fine mapping and locus discovery paradigms , both of which may lead to translationally relevant trait - specific biological mechanisms . .

( which was not certified by peer review ) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted September 29 , 2021 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2021 . 09 . 27 . 21264198 doi : medRxiv preprint Results : To develop our approach , we needed to define the set of traits , identify positive and negative loci for those traits , and obtain a collection of genomic features to discriminate between these labels . For traits to study , we focused on 42 phenotypes obtained from curated GWAS and the NHGRI - EBI GWAS catalog that we collapsed into 17 related trait groupings ( Methods , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Using all GWAS lead variants identified , we first clumped variants into loci by linkage disequilibrium ( using European LD R 2 > 0 . 7 ) . Next , for each trait group we defined positive loci as those which contained at least one variant with an associated P - value < 5 x 10 - 8 with at least one of the phenotypes in the trait group . Negative loci for each trait group were defined as those without any variant even modestly associated ( P - value > 0 . 05 ) with one or more of the phenotypes in the trait group . We utilized genome - wide annotations from multiple public resources , including nearest gene tissue - specific expression and epigenomic features , tagging these features across positive and negative examples if the features overlapped with any variant in the locus . We then generated predictive models for each of the 17 trait groups using a penalized binomial logistic regression model ( LASSO ) 28 , using cross - validation for training and estimating final prediction accuracy on a holdout set not used in training any model ( Methods , Supplementary Figure 1 ) . We defined a model as informative if the area under the curve ( AUC ) was ≥ 0 . 7 and the difference between training and holdout AUCs was ≤ 0 . 02 ( implying only a small level of overfitting ) . Based on these criteria , models trained for autoimmune , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , lipid , platelet , red blood cell ( RBC ) , and white blood cell ( WBC ) traits passed , and were the focus of further investigation ( Figure 1a , Table 1 ) . To assess why these 6 traits produced successful models while the other 11 failed , we considered whether trait models with more positive loci or more features were more predictive ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . We did not find an obvious relationship between either number of loci used to train models or number of annotations selected and holdout set AUC , suggesting that our inability to predict these traits is not based on limitations in availability of positive / negative examples or the total number of available features . The implication may be that the catalog of existing features available for modelling insufficiently captures differences between these other 11 traits and the spectrum of complex traits more generally . We considered two metrics of model specificity . First , trait specific models should be more informative for prediction relative to functional variant prediction methods which were designed to be trait agnostic . For the trait groups we assembled , the holdout set AUCs for CADD , GWAVA , and DeepSEA were all close to 0 . 5 , indicating that none were informative for discriminating amongst trait - associated GWAS loci ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ) . Second , trait specific predictors should perform the best on the phenotype collections from which they were trained . Looking at comparative model performance , we observed that all six selected models were better at predicting their own holdout set compared to others ( Figure 2 , left panels and Supplementary Figure 3 ) . These results indicate that these six prediction models can discriminate between traits using GWAS loci alone , and that the power to make .

Given the pervasive nature of pleiotropy , we would expect that predictors for traits that are related to one another – but perhaps not so closely as to be grouped together – should be partially cross - predictive . We observed this to be true for the RBC model , which could be used to predict the platelet holdout set with an AUC of 0 . 79 ( Figure 2A , left panel ) . To rule out that this similarity was driven by loci that are positive for both traits , we removed all loci from the holdout set that were positive in both the “in - focus” trait ( here , platelets ) and any other model , then reassessed the holdout AUC for each model . Even after removing overlapping loci , the RBC model still predicted the platelet holdout set well , indicating the prediction accuracy is not driven by overlapping loci ( RBC AUC of 0 . 76 on platelets holdout set ; Figure 2A , right panel ) . In contrast , the ECG model was the only one that predicted the ECG holdout set reasonably , while the autoimmune , lipids , platelets , RBC and WBC models all had AUC < 0 . 55 on the ECG holdout ( Figure 2B ) . Looking at the annotations selected as important for our six successful models , we found them to be largely in line with known trait biology ( Figure 3 , Supplementary Figure 4 , Supplementary Table 3 ) . All three blood traits ( platelets , RBC , and WBC ) selected mainly whole blood annotations that positively rank active regions ( active histone marks , gene expression , and transcription factor ( TF ) binding ) and negatively rank repressive histone marks ( H3K9me3 ) ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure 4B and 4C ) . By contrast , the ECG model selected only heart tissue annotations ( Figure 3B ) , and the lipids model chose predominantly liver tissue features ( Figure 3C ) . We also identified features that distinguish these traits from each other . For example , only the models for the immune traits autoimmune and WBC selected spleen gene expression . We next used the framework of stratified LDScore regression 29 to evaluate if the scores emitted by our models could be used as an annotation to explain partitioned heritability . With our six added annotations derived from our six selected models , we tested 103 annotations in total and so considered enrichments with P - value < 4 . 8 x 10 - 4 significant by Bonferroni correction . We found enrichment in GWAS for all successful models with summary statistics available ( autoimmune , lipids , platelets , RBC , WBC ) ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . To test whether this enrichment was driven by the lead GWAS SNPs that the models were based on , we also removed these lead GWAS SNPs and their LD proxies ( EUR R 2 LD > 0 . 7 ) from the dataset and reassessed enrichment . We found that the lipids , platelets , and WBC models were significant in all individual phenotype association data , and the RBC model was significant for 3 of 4 phenotype GWAS ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . Perplexingly , the autoimmune model was not significant for any phenotype GWAS after lead SNPs were removed , but the related trait models for WBC and platelets were significant for all 3 autoimmune phenotype GWAS . We expect that the autoimmune trait group failed this test due to a lack of power , as it had the fewest positive loci of the tested successful models . The enrichment we see in LDScore partitioned heritability demonstrates that our trait - and cell type - specific modeling approach can define target loci for related disease phenotypes , facilitating downstream validation and biological / mechanistic understanding . .

From ~ 78 million scored SNPs , we predicted between 7 , 366 and 485 , 424 trait associated SNPs per model that exceeded a FDR < 0 . 01 threshold ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . To find genes associated with these SNPs , we first identified the 436 and 2 , 137 genes overlapping these variants , of which 153 to 879 were outside of identified GWAS regions ( defined as 1MB window surrounding lead SNPs ; Supplementary Table 6 ) . For example , the lipids model identified 18 , 847 SNPs , with 458 overlapping genes , of which 167 were outside known GWAS regions . While we found many SNPs near established GWAS variants , we were interested here in the regions not previously identified by GWAS analyses , and our models highlight several points of potentially interesting biology . For the lipids model , we identified a cluster of 10 SNPs overlapping DHCR24 , a known cholesterol biosynthesis gene 30 , and a cluster of 63 SNPs overlapping PLIN2 , a gene involved in lipid globule storage 31 , both of which are reasonable biological candidates for lipid related phenotypes . For the platelets model , we identified a cluster of 8 SNPs overlapping JARID2 , a gene known to be involved in hematopoiesis 32 , and 7 SNPs overlapping PXN , which is involved in immunity response 33 , both of which may plausibly impact platelet phenotypes . Additionally , we found that FDR < 0 . 01 variants of the platelets , RBC , and WBC models were enriched for being within 25kb of a newly published set of blood traits GWAS 34 ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . To assess whether the trait associated SNPs mapped onto established biological knowledge , we used GREAT 35 analysis to examine both the human gene ontology ( GO ) biological process and mouse single knockout ( KO ) phenotypes associated with these SNPs . We used both the full set of trait associated SNPs and also removed all variants within 500 KB of identified GWAS regions ( non - GWAS variants ) ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . For the full set of trait associated SNPs , all models returned mouse KO phenotypes consistent with our expectations . For example , mouse KOs for genes overlapping our autoimmune associated SNPs are enriched for phenotypes such as “abnormal T cell morphology” and “decreased lymphocyte cell number . ” GO biological processes were similarly consistent with expectations for autoimmune , ECG , lipids , and WBC trait models , while the platelets and RBC traits returned mostly generic results ( for example , “RNA processing” ) . The non - GWAS variants analyses were similar , except that the lipids and RBC models did not return any results for either the mouse KO or GO biological processes analyses . Application – Fine Mapping Functional cellular follow - up studies require one to prioritize GWAS loci , genes and variants within them that are likely causal . To assess the usefulness of our model scores for individual SNPs within GWAS loci , we identified SNPs in credible sets that exceed FDR thresholds of 0 . 10 , 0 . 25 , or 0 . 50 of the relevant model for phenotypes where appropriate summary statistics were available ( autoimmune , platelets , RBC and WBC , Table 2 , Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 ) . At FDR 0 . 10 , our models reduced the size of credible SNPs of interest in 27 % of multi - SNP credible sets ; at FDR 0 . 25 , 52 % of credible sets see a reduction in SNP number . For many of these loci the reduction is substantial . For example , lead rs10486483 from Crohn’s Disease had a credible set of 85 variants that was reduced to 3 after applying our FDR 0 . 10 threshold ; or lead rs2382817 in Inflammatory Bowel Disorder , where a credible set of 68 was reduced to 5 variants at the same threshold . While a set threshold is useful for summarizing , it is .

Discussion : With current pitfalls in fine mapping and locus discovery , our approach can distinguish amongst complex trait - related groups applied to 17 sets of traits . Our modeling process , built using publicly available GWAS and annotation data , selects and outputs features and variants relevant to underlying disease biology . These models predict differences between traits that currently available SNP ranking schemes do not , and the overlaps we see among models are consistent with known biological links between the traits assessed . Our modelling strategy makes no assumptions about number of causal variants in a GWAS locus , is expandable to include new genome wide features as they are developed , and can be applied to locus discovery problems or to prioritization after fine - mapping for functional validation efforts . This approach is limited by both the GWAS data and genome wide features available . Surprisingly , we were unable to adequately model some complex traits ( Table 1 ) . However , we expect that additional genomic features will improve some models ; for example , in the dataset used for this analysis there are 642 annotations from blood tissue but only 31 from bone ( Supplementary Table 2 ) and it seems likely that part of the reason the height model was not well specified is that it lacked key genomic annotations relevant to bone growth . Additionally , the rapidly expanding repertoire of single cell data sets may better parse complex tissue types ( e . g . , pancreas ) and capture data relevant to rare cell types that are underrepresented in current datasets . Future studies will be designed to incorporate these data types , which are only currently emerging . We selected a modelling strategy to allow for improved biological interpretability , but this presumably comes at a cost of accuracy . We intentionally selected a variety of traits with very different underlying physiology , and we found that the traits well described by our models are linked largely to single cell types , namely blood , liver , or heart . We do not successfully model traits such as Body Mass Index ( BMI ) or Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) , both of which involve many tissues and have disease subtypes that are not well captured in current GWAS analyses 36 – 38 . We expect that analyzing these phenotypes as a single cohort may serve to obfuscate rather than clarify , and anticipate that incorporating more granularity in phenotypes ( type of T2D or severity of BMI , for example ) will improve model performance . Pleiotropy presents another challenge to our modeling approach , but is inherently captured in any genomic data set . It is plausible that more sophisticated approaches with this in mind might be anticipated to improve performance ( e . g . , multi - label classification ) . Moreover , approaches that captured uncertainty around labelled examples ( e . g . , “noisy” labels ) might also be helpful to address these challenges as well as expand the use of both positive and negative examples . Additional processing of genome wide features , both to account for correlation and to reduce the feature space prior to model building ( e . g . , stability selection ) may also improve results . .

The most similar is the fGWAS method , which is designed to jointly consider GWAS and genomic annotations 39 . The main distinction between these models is that fGWAS considers trait loci compared to all regions of the genome ( regardless of their association with a complex trait ) while TSABL specifically uses established GWAS loci as the negative set . In practice , what this means is that TSABL models found differences between traits , rather than annotations that may be held in common between all GWAS loci . While both approaches are useful , identifying trait specific annotations will allow for the translation of GWAS loci into functional biological hypotheses , facilitating disease treatment and variant - based drug discovery . Methods : General data sources and analysis All chromosome : position coordinates given in this paper refer to genome build hg19 . We downloaded refseq gene exon coordinates for build hg19 from ENSEMBL 40 at http : / / grch37 . ensembl . org / biomart / on 10 / 24 / 17 , and used the extreme exon boundaries as gene boundaries . We assessed annotations for rsIDs of interest using ANNOVAR version 2016Feb01 41 and regulomeDB 42 . GWAS trait grouping Full listing of GWAS phenotypes included in each of the 17 trait groups are found in Supplementary Table 1 . We grouped GWAS together based on known biological links . The traits that include multiple GWAS analysis are autoimmune , blood pressure , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , lipids , platelets , red blood cell ( RBC ) , type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , and white blood cell ( WBC ) , For autoimmune , we used the five most correlated traits ( psoriasis , Crohn’s disease , ulcerative colitis , Behcet’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis ) in an analysis of autoimmune disease correlation 43 plus inflammatory bowel disorder due to its similarity to ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease 10 . For T2D , we also included fasting glucose and fasting insulin results from the NHGRI - EBI catalog , under the reasoning that either or both are used in the clinical diagnosis of T2D . For the remaining trait groups , all GWAS phenotypes included were assessed in the same paper and are highly correlated . GWAS loci identification & processing We downloaded the NHGRI - EBI GWAS catalog v1 . 0 2019 - 06 - 20 from https : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / gwas / docs / file - downloads on 06 / 21 / 19 and processed GWAS results by removing the following associations : 1 ) with no listed P - value or a P - value > 5e - 8 2 ) with no rsID listed or multiple rsIDs listed 3 ) listed as on the X chromosome , no chromosome , or multiple chromosomes 4 ) with descriptions indicating they were interaction effects with another locus 5 ) located in the HLA region ( chr6 : 29670261 - 33104175 ; hg19 coordinates ) Remaining associations were grouped by rsIDs , resulting in 53 , 640 variants . .

Literature curated GWAS variants were processed in the same way as catalog variants so that our input was a list of variant rsIDs . For all variants , we identified hg19 positions using Ensembl biomart 40 , and removed variants if they could not be assigned a position . We identified loci of interest by collecting all variants with R 2 ≥ 0 . 7 to a GWAS variant in European 1000 genomes phase III 44 data using PLINK 1 . 90Beta4 . 5 45 . Variants were considered part of a locus if they had R 2 ≥ 0 . 7 with any other variant in the locus . Final variant list includes 715 , 404 variants assigned to 32 , 713 loci and can be found in Supplementary Table 10 . Feature identification and processing Gappedpeak files for histone ChIP - seq experiments and the “hotspot . fdr0 . 01 . broad” files for DNase assays were downloaded on 02 / 10 / 16 from the consolidated epigenomes section of the Roadmap Epigenomics Project 46 portal . Uniform DNase files were downloaded 03 / 28 / 16 from http : / / hgdownload . cse . ucsc . edu / goldenPath / hg19 / encodeDCC / wgEncodeAwgDnaseUniform / . Homo sapiens FAIRE , transcription profiling by array , and ChIP - seq data were downloaded 01 . 06 . 16 from the ENCODE 47 project portal . We included data as provided for experiment accession numbers with a single file , and used the intersection if multiple files were provided . For transcription profiling by array data , we selected data labeled as “filtered transcribed fragments” if available . For ChIP - seq files , if the experiment accession had a file labeled “optimal idr threshold” or “replicated peaks” we used that file . For histone data , if both broadpeak and narrowpeak files were available , we created gappedpeak files . If only one peak type was available , we included that file . For all ChIP - seq targets that were not histones , narrowpeak files were used if available and broadpeak files otherwise . The complete list of 2305 ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics features used in this paper is found in Supplementary Table 2 . Feature overlaps with GWAS loci were identified using bedtools2v2 . 25 . 0 intersect 48 . For a given locus , a feature was coded as 1 if any variant in the locus overlapped the feature , and a 0 if not . For indel variants , overlap was counted only with the start position of the variant . To build the features for tissue - specific gene expression , we utilized previously calculated t - statistics for specific expression 49 . The nearest gene to each locus was determined as the gene containing a corresponding tissue - specific expression t - statistic with a start position nearest to the locus center . The locus was assigned a 1 in a tissue if the nearest gene had a t - statistic ranking in the top ten percent for that tissue and a 0 otherwise , creating 53 tissue - specific nearest gene expression features .

We use the highest variant 100way phastCon score as the score for the locus . Finally , we counted the number of variants in a locus and included normalized variant number as a possible feature . Tables of features used for modelling are in Supplementary Table 11 . Benchmarking scores We downloaded CADD 24 scores for 1000 genomes phase 3 variants from http : / / cadd . gs . washington . edu / download on 02 / 25 / 16 . We downloaded GWAVA 25 scores on 02 / 25 / 2016 from ftp : / / ftp . sanger . ac . uk / pub / resources / software / gwava / v1 . 0 / annotated / GWAVA _ db _ csv . tgz and used tss _ score for all analyses . For both CADD and GWAVA , a higher score indicates a greater probability of functionality , so if the downloaded database had multiple scores for a position , we used the highest score provided . If they did not have a score for a position , it was set to 0 . We use the highest variant score as the locus score for both CADD and GWAVA . We used the standalone deepSEA - 0 . 94 26 program to get deepSEA scores for our variants . Unlike the previous scores , a smaller e value corresponds to a greater probability of functionality , so we use the lowest variant deepSEA score as the score for the locus . For comparison purposes , we subtract this value from 1 so that it is on the same scale as the other metrics . Building models For model training , we considered a locus as being positive for a trait if at least one variant in the locus was associated with the trait and negative otherwise . We separated all loci into 2 / 3 training and 1 / 3 holdout . This separation was done semi - randomly , with the following conditions enforced : 1 ) for each trait , maintained a 2 / 3 train , 1 / 3 holdout ratio for positive loci , and 2 ) maintained native distribution of variant count in loci ( for example if there were 60 loci containing 10 variants each , 40 were assigned to training and 20 to holdout ) . Furthermore , we removed any locus with > 1000 variants ( 1 locus removed ) . In this way we created a separate set of holdout loci that were not used to build any of the trait models and so could be used to compare model predictions across traits . For each trait , we processed the training and holdout sets to identify positive and negative loci . First , we identified positive loci where at least one variant had P - value < 5 x 10 - 8 with a phenotype in the trait group . From the remaining loci , we removed those with P - value < 0 . 05 in the associated GWAS ( if summary statistics were available – no removals for ECG or psoriasis GWAS were possible ) to create a negatives pool . Finally , we used only positive loci where we could match 6 ( 5 for height ) negative loci with similar locus variant counts : within 10 of a locus with variant count < 100 or within 50 of a locus with variant count > = 100 . This ensured that our positive and negative locus pools were roughly matched for locus size . Using these processed positive and negative locus sets for each trait , we built models using the glmnet 28 package in R , using binomial logistic regression with LASSO regularization and maximizing the AUC . The feature pool included 2305 ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap annotations , 53 tissue - specific nearest gene expression annotations , the 100way Phastcon score , and normalized variant .

We used 10 - fold cross validation to select lambda . s1e , performed 15 trials of model building , and selected the median training AUC model as the trait model for analysis ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Model analysis General model performance was assessed using the ROCR package 52 in R on the holdout data & compared to the GWAVA , CADD , and DeepSEA predictors . We considered a model successful if the holdout AUC was > 0 . 7 and the difference between training and testing AUC was < 0 . 02 ; this includes models describing autoimmune , ECG , lipid , platelet , RBC , and WBC traits . Trait specific model performance was assessed by comparing the six selected model predictions on each holdout set . FDR thresholds used in further analysis were calculated from holdout datasets only . Due to the nature of GWAS , there are loci tagged as positive across multiple traits . It is possible that these loci were driving the correlation between models for different traits . To test this , we removed all loci that are positive in the holdout set for the trait of interest and any other well modeled trait , creating a non - overlapping holdout set . We then compared ROC plots of the prediction of different models on the all and no overlap holdouts ( Figure 2 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Genome Wide SNP Scores Used 1000 genomes phase III downloaded on 03 / 03 / 2016 from ftp : / / ftp . 1000genomes . ebi . ac . uk / vol1 / ftp / release / 20130502 / . Removed all variants that were not SNPs or that did not have rsID , leaving 78 , 017 , 615 SNPs . Calculated scores for individual SNPs via bedtools intersect using bed files used to make models , and recalculated gene expression annotation using single SNPs instead of loci . We then identified SNPs ≥ FDR 99 threshold for each model , excluding all SNPs used as positives in model building ( Supplementary Table 6 ) . To calculate enrichment in the most recent blood traits GWAS 34 , we used the fGWAS 39 platform . We downloaded the trans - ethnic MR - MEGA summary statistics for RBC , HCT , MCV , RDW , Neutro , Mono , Baso , Eosin , PLT and MPV phenotypes from http : / / www . mhi - humangenetics . org / en / resources / on 08 / 13 / 21 . We filtered these results to remove variants at the same genomic coordinates , keeping the most common variant and calculated nearest distance to an FDR < 0 . 01 variant in the corresponding TSABL model ( RBC : RBC , HCT , MCV , RDW ; WBC : Neutro , Mono , Baso , Eosin ; platelets : PLT , MPV ) . We ran fGWAS using distance intervals of 25 , 50 and 500 kb ( ranging from most to least stringent ) and found 25kb to have the best enrichment for all phenotypes ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) We used the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool ( GREAT ) 35 to interpret these scores using version 4 . 0 . 4 found at http : / / bejerano . stanford . edu / great / public / html / index . php . SNPs with FDR < 0 . 01 as described above were submitted using the whole genome as background to assess genomic enrichment . We found that the tool did not function if more than 150 , 000 SNPs were submitted , so for datasets with > 150 , 000 SNPs ( ECG , WBC ) , a random subset of 150 , 000 was submitted . To assess if enrichments changed when variants linked to known GWAS variants were removed , we removed any variants within 500 KB of a lead GWAS hit for the trait , again submitting a random 150 , 000 if the SNP list exceeded ( ECG ) this threshold . For all analysis , we recorded the GO biological processes and mouse .

We note that the analyses that returned no results were all assessing < 7 , 000 SNPs , and expect that they failed due to having too few input regions . Full lists of variants and results can be found in Supplementary Table 7 . Credible Sets We used available summary statistics ( Supplementary Table 1 ) to calculate credible sets for GWAS of interest . We limited our analysis to loci used for modelling where the lead SNP was present in the summary statistic data ( this eliminated ECG , for which no summary statistics were available , and lipids , which was missing summary statistics for many lead variants ) . We identified variants of interest within a 1 MB window surrounding lead SNPs , limiting to variants with R 2 ≥ 0 . 5 to the lead variant in European 1000 genomes phase III 44 data using PLINK 1 . 90Beta4 . 5 45 These variants were assessed using R package corrcov 53 to create 95 % confidence interval credible sets ( Supplementary Table 8 ) . To calculate percentage of credible sets our models reduce SNP number for , at each FDR threshold we found the number of credible sets where that threshold yielded at least 1 , but less than the maximum number of SNPs and divided by the number of credible sets with more than 1 SNP . LDSC Partitioned Heritability Downloaded LD Scores v2 . 2 , plink files , weights , and other necessary files from https : / / data . broadinstitute . org / alkesgroup / LDSCORE . Added 6 annotations corresponding to 0 - 1 normalized SNP scores , one per trait model ( autoimmune , ECG , lipids , platelets , RBC , WBC ) to V2 . 2 annot files . Removed 11 , 608 SNPs on chromosome 12 containing ssIDs instead of rsIDs from both annot and plink files . Recalculated LD Scores 29 using new annot files as per https : / / github . com / bulik / ldsc / wiki / LD - Score - Estimation - Tutorial . Partitioned heritability for 20 relevant GWAS ( Supplementary Table 4 ) as per https : / / github . com / bulik / ldsc / wiki / Partitioned - Heritability . For models with some GWAS summary statistics ( autoimmune , lipids , platelets , RBC , WBC ) , we also removed SNPs in LD R 2 > 0 . 7 with lead SNPs ( Supplementary Table 12 ) from both annot and plink files , then recalculated LD Scores and repartitioned heritability to test how much heritability is driven by lead SNPs ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . .
