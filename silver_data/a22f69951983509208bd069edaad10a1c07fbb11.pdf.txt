Real - Time Measurements of Actin Filament Polymerization by Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence Microscopy Jeffrey R . Kuhn and Thomas D . Pollard Department of Molecular , Cellular , and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06520 ABSTRACT Understanding the mechanism of actin polymerization and its regulation by associated proteins requires an assay to monitor polymerization dynamics and ﬁlament topology simultaneously . The only assay meeting these criteria is total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ) . The ﬂuorescence signal is fourfold stronger with actin labeled on Cys - 374 with Oregon green rather than rhodamine . To distinguish growth at barbed and pointed ends we used image drift correction and maximum intensity projections to reveal points where single N - ethylmaleimide inactivated myosins attach ﬁlaments to the glass coverslip . We estimated association rates at high actin concentrations and dissociation rates near and below the critical actin concentration . At the barbed end , the association rate constant for Mg - ATP - actin is 7 . 4 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and the dissociation rate constant is 0 . 89 s (cid:2) 1 . At the pointed end the association and dissociation rate constants are 0 . 56 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and 0 . 19 s (cid:2) 1 . When vitamin D binding protein sequesters all free monomers , ADP - actin dis - sociates from barbed ends at 1 . 4 s (cid:2) 1 and from pointed ends at 0 . 16 s (cid:2) 1 regardless of buffer nucleotide . INTRODUCTION Actin polymerization contributes to many cellular processes under the control of proteins that maintain a pool of unpolymerized monomers , initiate new ﬁlaments , cap ﬁla - ment ends , and promote ﬁlament turnover . Understanding these mechanisms requires assays that detect not only the concentration of polymer but also the number of ﬁlaments , the direction of growth , and the presence of branches . Early studies of actin polymerization used viscometry or light scattering to measure the polymer concentration ( Oosawa and Asakura , 1975 ) , but these methods are limited because the signal depends not only on the polymer concentration , but also on the size of the ﬁlaments and the extent of cross - linking . In addition , viscometric measurements perturbed assembly by fragmenting ﬁlaments . What was needed was a sensitive , spectroscopic assay to measure polymer concentration directly in real time . Actin labeled on Cys - 374 with pyrenyl iodoacetamide ﬁlled this need ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) , because the ﬂuores - cence of the polymer is 20 times higher than the monomer . This assay revolutionized actin research and has been the standard method for 20 years . However , this assay has limitations . First , it measures only the concentration of polymer . The direction of growth and number of ﬁlaments must be inferred , often with considerable uncertainty . Al - though capping proteins have been used to separate barbed from pointed end growth , these assays must assume a constant concentration of ends and thus ignore ﬁlament nucleation , annealing , and severing . Second , some proteins including myosin ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) and actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) quench the ﬂuorescence of pyrenyl - actin ﬁlaments . This is useful for binding studies , but makes it impossible to study how these proteins regulate actin polymerization . Labeling actin with 7 - chloro - 4 - nitrobenzeno - 2 - oxa - 1 , 3 - diazole on Lys - 373 ( Detmers et al . , 1981 ) circumvents the quenching problem , but not the uncertainty regarding the number of ﬁlaments or their direction of growth . Fluorescence microscopy of ﬁlaments labeled with ﬂuorescent - phalloidin ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ; Burlacu et al . , 1992 ; Xu et al . , 1999 ; Yanagida et al . , 1984 ) reveals branches and allows measurement of ﬁlament lengths and direction of growth . Together with knowledge of the poly - mer concentration , this method makes it possible to calculate the number of ﬁlaments , but these insights are available only on static samples . Electron microscopy can be used to dis - tinguish the growth at the two ends of actin ﬁlaments ( Bonder and Mooseker , 1986 ; Pollard , 1986 ; Pollard and Mooseker , 1981 ; Woodrum et al . , 1975 ) , but this approach is also restricted to samples taken at particular time points and requires ﬁxation in nonphysiological buffers . An ideal assay would employ continuous observation of growing ﬁlaments , allowing documentation of the nucleation of new ﬁlaments ( de novo or as branches ) and growth at both ends . Fluorescence microscopy can image single actin ﬁla - ments containing subunits labeled with a ﬂuorescent dye ( Cintio et al . , 2001 ) and thus has many features of an ideal assay . To avoid interference from the sea of unlabeled actin monomers required in a polymerization experiment , the ﬂuorescent ﬁlaments must be excited either with an eva - nescent wave by total internal reﬂection ( TIR ) ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ) or by confocal illu - mination ( Ichetovkin et al . , 2002 ) . Our improvements in ﬂuorescent labeling of actin , microscope hardware , and image analysis software have made real - time microscopy of Submitted June 9 , 2004 , and accepted for publication October 27 , 2004 .

We describe these improvements and characterize the elongation and the steady - state treadmilling of actin ﬁlaments . MATERIALS AND METHODS Proteins Unlabeled actin Actin was puriﬁed from acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle by one cycle of polymerization and pelleting ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) . We carried out all steps at 0 – 4 (cid:3) C unless speciﬁed otherwise . The pellet was resuspended in buffer G ( 2 mM Tris - Cl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , DTT ) , sonicated for 1 min in a bath sonicator , diluted to 6 mg / ml , and dialyzed against three changes of buffer G over 2 days . After centrifugation at 10 5 3 g for 2 h , the crude actin in the top 80 % of the supernatant was gel ﬁltered on Sephacryl S - 300 ( Amersham Bio - sciences , Piscataway , NJ ) to separate monomers from oligomers and minor contaminants . We measured the concentration of unlabeled actin by absorbance using an extinction coefﬁcient of E 290 ¼ 26 ; 600M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 ( Houk and Ue , 1974 ) . Labeled actin CrudemonomericactinwasdialyzedagainsttwochangesofbufferGwithout DTT for 1 h each . After clariﬁcation at 500 3 g for 5 min , actin was poly - merized by mixing an equal volume of cold 2 3 label buffer ( 2 3 ¼ 50 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 M KCl , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 6 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 6 mM ATP ) . After 5 min polymerized actin was diluted to 1 mg / ml with cold 1 3 label buffer . A fresh 10 - mM stock solution of Oregon green 488 iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) was prepared in N , N - dimethylformamide . A 12 - to 15 - fold molar excess of Oregon green was added dropwise to the actin while stirring , and the solution was stirred gently overnight . Labeled actin was clariﬁed at 500 3 g for 5 min and centrifuged at 10 5 3 g for 2 h to pellet actin ﬁlaments . The pellet was resuspendedinbufferG , sonicatedfor1min , dilutedto6mg / ml , anddialyzed for1 . 5daysagainsttwochangesofbufferGandonechangeofbufferG6 . 5 ( 5 mM PIPES - Tris , pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM NaN 3 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . Aftercentrifugationat 10 5 3 g for2h , thesupernatant wasloadedonto a 1 3 5 . 5 - cm column of DEAE - cellulose DE52 ( Whatman , Kent , UK ) equilibratedwithbufferG6 . 5andelutedwitha200 - mlgradientof0 – 300mM KClinbufferG6 . 5toseparateunlabeledfromlabeledactin . Thepeakfraction and following fractions down to 30 % of the peak concentration were pooled , dialyzed overnight against polymerization buffer ( 5 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 5 mM , 0 . 3 mM , 0 . 5 mM , 1 mM NaN 3 , and centrifuged at 10 5 3 g for 2 h . The pellet was resuspended in buffer G , sonicatedfor 1 min , and dialyzed for 2 days againstthree changes of bufferG to depolymerize actin . We separated labeled actin monomers from oligomers by centrifugation at 10 5 3 g for 2 h and gel ﬁltration on a Sephacryl S - 300 . Fractions were stored at 4 (cid:3) C and remained active for up to 4 weeks . The concentrationoflabeledactinwasmeasuredbyabsorbanceat290and491nm using the extinction of OG at 491 nm E 491 ¼ 77 ; 800M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 and a correction for OG absorbance at 290 nm of A (cid:3) 290 ¼ A 290 (cid:2) 0 : 16991 A 491 : The ratio of labeled actin to total actin is ½ OG (cid:4) = ½ Actin Total (cid:4) : Myosin Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin ( Kielley and Harrington , 1959 ) was stored at (cid:2) 20 (cid:3) C in 50 % glycerol . Aliquots of ; 10 m M myosin were dialyzed against 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 , 0 . 5 M KCl , 10 mM EDTA for 2 h . After incubation with 1 mM NEM for 1 h on ice , 1 mM DTT was added for 1 h on ice . Myosin was dialyzed against 50 % glycerol in 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 , 0 . 5 M KCl , 10 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT overnight , and stored at (cid:2) 20 (cid:3) C . Slide preparation Flint glass slides of 25 3 75 3 1 mm ( Erie Scientiﬁc , Portsmouth , NJ ) were cleaned by a modiﬁed acid wash technique . Slides in glass vertical staining jars were sonicated for 45 min in 2 % ( v / v ) Versaclean detergent ( Fisher Scientiﬁc , Hampton , NH ) in hot tap water , rinsed 10 times in hot water , and sonicated an additional 30 min . Slides were rinsed 10 times with distilled water , incubated for 3 h in 1 M KOH at 42 (cid:3) C , rinsed three times in double distilled ( dd ) water , and incubated overnight in 1 M HCl at 42 (cid:3) C . Jars were cooled to room temperature , rinsed ﬁve times in dd water , sonicated for 30 min in dd water , rinsed twice in 1 mM EDTA , and sonicated for 30 min in EDTA to reduce calcium contamination . Slides were rinsed twice in 70 % ethanol , sonicated for 30 min , rinsed twice in absolute ethanol , sonicated for 30 min , and rinsed in absolute ethanol . Clean slides were stored in absolute ethanol in screw - top plastic jars and were used within two weeks . Flow cell preparation Flow cells containing 3 – 5 m l of ﬂuid were prepared each day as in Kron and Spudich ( 1986 ) . Two - and - one - quarter - inch strips of paraﬁlm were stretched to approximately three times their length and placed across the long axis of a 24 3 50 - mm , No . 1 coverslip ( VWR International , West Chester , PA ) , leaving a 2 - mm gap . A clean , 25 3 75 3 1 - mm ﬂint glass slide was removed from ethanol , ﬂamed dry , cooled , and placed perpendicular across the paraﬁlm strips . The paraﬁlm strips were compressed by ﬁrm hand pressure on the top of the slide to seal the sides of the chamber . The chamber was ﬂamed again brieﬂy and cooled to stick the protruding paraﬁlm strips to the open coverslip surface . For an inverted microscope , chambers were used with the coverslip down , facing the objective lens , and slide up , supporting the prism . Solutions were loaded directly into the chamber via capillary action . The solution in the chamber was changed by placing 2 3 chamber volumes of solution at one end and then pulling it through with a piece of ﬁlter paper on the other side . To prevent ﬂuid ﬂow onto the top of the slide , hydrophobic ‘‘corrals’’ were drawn across the top edges of the slide , above the entrance and exit ports with room temperature VALAP ( 1 : 1 : 1 vaseline / lanolin / parafﬁn ) . Polymerization experiments Unlabeled and labeled Ca - ATP - actin were dialyzed overnight against buffer G , centrifuged at 10 5 3 g for 2 h , the supernatant concentrations measured , and mixed with buffer G to the desired labeled fraction at 2 . 22 times the ﬁnal concentration . Ca - ATP - actin was converted to Mg - ATP - actin for each experiment by adding 1 / 10 part of 10 3 Mg exchange buffer ( 10 mM EDTA , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) to give two times the ﬁnal actin concentration and incubating on ice for 5 min . NEM - inactivated myosin was diluted to 0 . 2 m M in high salt Tris - buffered saline ( HS - TBS , 50 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 6 , 600 mM NaCl ) containing a 10 (cid:2) 4 dilution of 200 nm crimson ﬂuorescent microspheres ( Molecular Probes ) and 5 m l were loaded into a freshly prepared ﬂow cell . After 1 min at room temperature ﬂow cells were washed with 10 m l 1 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in HS - TBS followed by 10 m l 1 % BSA in low - salt Tris - buffered saline ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 6 , 50 mM NaCl ) . Mg - ATP - actin ( 2 3 ) was mixed 1 : 1 with 2 3 TIR buffer ( 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , 20 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 200 mM DTT , 0 . 4 mM ATP , 30 mM glucose , 1 % methylcellulose , 40 m g / ml catalase , 200 m g / ml glucose oxidase ) and 10 m l were immediately loaded into the chamber and placed on the microscope . Actin ﬁlament seeds marked for polarity Marked actin ﬁlament seeds were created as follows : 10 m M Mg - ATP - actin was mixed 1 : 1 with 2 3 TIR buffer , incubated at room temperature for 10 min to form ﬁlaments ; 30 m m long , fragmented for 1 min in a bath sonicator , and incubated for 10 min . Chambers coated with NEM - myosin 1388 Kuhn and Pollard Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 and microspheres were washed once with 10 m l of 1 3 TIR buffer and 1 m l of seed mixture was ﬂowed into the chamber in the reverse direction to form a gradient of seed densities on the surface . After 1 min , 10 m l of freshly prepared Mg - ATP - actin at 0 . 5 3 , 1 3 , or 2 3 the labeled fraction of seeds was mixed 1 : 1 with 2 3 TIR buffer , loaded into the ﬂow chamber in the forward direction , and allowed to polymerize for a short time . Mg - ATP - actin was diluted to two times the desired concentration , mixed 1 : 1 with 2 3 TIR buffer , and 10 m l were loaded in the forward direction into a chamber containing preformed ﬁlaments . Depolymerization Twenty - ﬁve percent labeled , 3 m M Mg - ATP - actin was mixed 1 : 1 with 2 3 ATP - TIR buffer , loaded into a ﬂow chamber coated with NEM - myosin and microspheres , and incubated for 10 min . Chambers were washed with 25 % labeled 0 . 18 m M Mg - ATP - actin in 1 3 ATP - TIR buffer , and incubated for 22 min to convert ﬁlaments to Mg - ADP - actin . Chambers were washed with 50 % labeled 1 . 5 m M Mg - ATP - actin for 1 – 2 min , and washed with either 1 3 ATP - or ADP - TIR buffer containing 5 m M vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ) . Microscope An Olympus IX - 71 microscope ( Olympus America , Melville , NY ) on an optical bench was modiﬁed for prism - based TIRF illumination ( Fig . 1 ) . A single - mode optical ﬁber ( Oz Optics , Carp , Ontario , Canada ) transmitted light at 488 nm from a mechanically isolated 100 mW argon - ion laser ( Midwest Laser Products , Frankfort , IL ) . The 3 - mm beam was passed through a 5 3 beam expander and an active phase scrambler ( a transparent plastic petri dish spinning at . 1000 rpm ) to remove interference patterns due to stray light and produce even excitation illumination . Two dielectric mirrors steered the beam to the microscope stage at a 13 (cid:3) angle from the horizontal , where it was focused with an f ¼ 100 mm convex lens onto a right - angle prism attached to a ﬂow cell by a thin layer of glycerol . The exit beam was absorbed by a beam block . Optics and optomechanics were from Thorlabs ( Newton , NJ ) . Uniblitz shutters ( Vincent Associates , Rochester , NY ) controlled the illumination from the laser and arc lamp . A motorized ﬁlter turret ( Olympus ) switched ﬁlter cubes , and a Mac 5000 stepper motor controlled focus ( Ludl Electronic Products , Hawthorne , NY ) . Images were captured with an Orca - ER charge - coupled device camera ( Model C4742 - 95 - 12ER , Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) . A custom - designed image acquisition plug - in for the public domain image analysis program , ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health , http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) , controlled the microscope ﬁlter wheel , shutters , focus , and camera . Autofocus Imaging a ﬁeld of subresolution , crimson ﬂuorescent microspheres ( Molecular Probes ) on the chamber surface was used to select the best focal plane for TIR imaging . Before each time lapse TIR exposure through a ﬂuorescein ﬁlter cube ( Chroma Technology , Rockingham , VT ) , a rhodamine ﬁlter cube ( Chroma ) was rotated into place , the epiﬂuorescence shutter was opened and eight images , spaced at Z axis increments of 1 m m , were taken of the ﬁeld of beads . Each image I xy ð z Þ was convolved with a derivative of a Gaussian ﬁlter . The resulting x - and y - derivative images were summed , squared , and added together to form a single focus value at each z - position , f ð z Þ ¼ + W x ¼ 1 + H y ¼ 1 dG x dx 5 I xy ð z Þ ! 2 1 + W x ¼ 1 + H y ¼ 1 dG y dy 5 I xy ð z Þ ! 2 ; ( 1 ) where G x ¼ 1 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 ps 2 p exp (cid:2) x 2 2 s 2 (cid:3) (cid:4) : ( 2 ) G y was similarly deﬁned in the y - direction , and W and H were the image width and height , respectively . A Gaussian width of s ¼ 2 was used . The z - value , which maximized f ð z Þ ; was estimated using parabolic interpolation of the sampled maximum focus value f k ; and its two nearest neighbors f k (cid:2) 1 and f k 1 1 : z max ¼ z 0 1 k D z 1 1 2 f k (cid:2) 1 (cid:2) f k 1 1 f k (cid:2) 1 (cid:2) 2 f k 1 f k 1 1 D z : ( 3 ) The best - focus position was further reﬁned by using the estimated z - value as the center position of eight new epiﬂuorescent images , spaced D z ¼ 0 : 25 m m apart , and the focus function and best - focus position are recalculated . Because this autofocusing process is very insensitive to noise , short exposure times could be used , and the entire focus process was completed in , 5 s . Drift correction The drift correction algorithm was written in Java as a plug - in for ImageJ . Drift was typically corrected in two phases . In the ﬁrst phase , a single bright ﬂuorescent speckle was roughly tracked by hand through every frame . The tracking was reﬁned to the center of the speckle at each frame as follows . The image was smoothed by convolution with a Gaussian kernel of s ¼ 1 (cid:2) 2 pixels in radius to reduce image noise . Local pixels within a certain radius ( typically 5 – 20 ) of the initial track point were searched for the maximum intensity . The position of the peak intensity was further reﬁned to subpixel accuracy in both x - and y - directions by parabolic interpolation between the peak pixel I m ; n and its two neighbors in either x or y as follows . Given an x - position of m , the discrete ﬁrst and second derivative of the intensity in the x - direction are ð dI = dx Þ ¼ ð I m 1 1 ; n (cid:2) I m (cid:2) 1 ; n Þ = 2 and ð d 2 I = dx 2 Þ ¼ 2 I m ; n (cid:2) I m 1 1 ; n (cid:2) I m (cid:2) 1 ; n ; respectively . The new x - position of the peak of the parabola is estimated from m peak ¼ m 1 ð dI = dx Þ = ð d 2 I = dx 2 Þ : The y - position of the peak n peak is estimated in the same way . Once the speckle centers were reﬁned in each frame , the position of the speckle in the ﬁrst frame was subtracted to obtain the drift over time . Each image was shifted in the opposite direction , using bilinear interpolation to estimate the intensity of fractional pixel positions . In the second correction pass , the positions of several particles were roughly marked in the ﬁrst frame . The centers of each particle were then found in each frame using the radial search and parabolic reﬁnement above . The average change in position of all particles was then calculated as the average drift of the entire image sequence . Each image was again shifted in the opposite direction using bilinear interpolation of the old image to obtain the new pixel intensities . Data analysis We wrote ﬁlament snapping and length measurement algorithms in Java as plug - ins for ImageJ . For each experiment , we performed drift correction on the entire image sequence and created an MIP of the entire sequence that was added to the end of the image sequence stack . Each pixel in the MIP represented the maximum intensity of that pixel over all time points . We selected single ﬁlaments for analysis , one at a time . A straight line drawn across the ﬁlament’s myosin restriction point in the MIP was recorded as the cutting line . For each time point , we traced the ﬁlament with a rough , freehand polygon , taking care to accurately mark the ﬁlament endpoints . The ﬁlament trace was reﬁned through several steps . The curve was ﬁrst smoothed by downsampling a Cartesian Fourier descriptors representation of the polygon ( Ja¨hne , 2002 ) as follows . The freehand polygon was converted to a ‘‘closed’’ curve by doubling each point such that the curve Actin Polymerization by TIRF Microscopy 1389 Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 was traced ﬁrst in the forward direction , then the opposite direction . Each original endpoint was further replicated in place twice to ‘‘ﬁx’’ its position . The x - and y - positions of each point P n ¼ ð x n ; y n Þ in the closed curve of N points were combined into a complex number representation z n ¼ x n 1 iy n : The sequence of z - values was converted into a Fourier series representation by calculating P ¼ N Fourier coefﬁcients using a discrete Fourier transform Z ð s Þ ¼ 1 N + N (cid:2) 1 n ¼ 0 z n exp (cid:2) i 2 p s n N (cid:3) (cid:4) ; ( 4 ) where each of the coefﬁcient Z ð s Þ represents successive approximations of the curve . The original curve could be reconstructed from these Fourier coefﬁcients by means of an inverse Fourier transform z n ¼ + P s ¼ 0 Z ð s Þ exp i 2 p n s P (cid:3) (cid:4) : ( 5 ) The original curve was smoothed by reconstruction from fewer Fourier coefﬁcients . To reduce the number of points to half , only the ﬁrst P / 2 coefﬁcients are used to reconstruct the curve . The polygon curve was then converted to an ‘‘open’’ curve by removing the second half of its points , effectively tracing the path only in the forward direction . Once we obtained a smooth , downsampled version of the rough ﬁlament trace , the trace was reﬁned to the centerline of the ﬁlament as follows . The entire image was smoothed by convolution with a Gaussian convolution kernel of s ¼ 1 (cid:2) 2 pixels in radius . For each point along the line P n ¼ ð x n ; y n Þ ; the estimated direction tangent to the ﬁlament was obtained by vector subtraction of the next and previous points u n ¼ P n 1 1 (cid:2) P n (cid:2) 1 : The direction perpendicular to the ﬁlament at that point was then v n ¼ ð(cid:2) u y ; n ; u x ; n Þ : The smoothed image was sampled at 1 - pixel increments along this perpendicular direction for a radius of 5 pixels in either direction . The intensities of fractional pixel positions were estimated by bilinear interpolation to obtain the intensity proﬁle perpendicular to the line . This proﬁle was searched for a local maximum intensity that was closest to the original point . The maximum intensity along this perpendicular direction was further reﬁned by one - dimensional parabolic interpolation with its two nearest neighbors in the proﬁle . The position of this maximum intensity was taken as the ﬁlament center , and the current point was moved to this point . This reﬁnement process could be iterated a second time to further deﬁne the center of the ﬁlament . When ﬁlament density was high , the reﬁnement process would occasionally cause the ﬁlament trace to ‘‘jump’’ to a nearby ﬁlament . In these instances , the ﬁlament could be traced again , the search radius could be decreased to 3 pixels in either direction , or the reﬁnement process could be limited to one iteration . The reﬁned ﬁlament trace was used to measure the length of the entire ﬁlament and the lengths on either side of the cutting line deﬁned earlier . The polygon representing the ﬁlament trace was followed from start to ﬁnish . The length of each segment of the polygon was calculated , and each segment was tested for intersection with the cutting line . Each time an intersection was found , the segment was cut at that point , the current length from either the ﬁlament start or the last intersection point was recorded , and the process continued from the intersection point until the other end of the ﬁlament was reached . Kymographs were produced by segmenting the reﬁned ﬁlament trace polygon into 1 - pixel - long intervals . The intensity at each vertex was estimated with bilinear interpolation of the nearest four pixels . The entire process of image smoothing , reﬁnement of the hand trace , and length measurement took roughly 1 s . For each ﬁlament , the measurement process was repeated at each time point to obtain the total ﬁlament length over time and lengths between both ends and the cutting line . Instantaneous rates were calculated with a windowed derivative ﬁlter . For each ﬁlament end , the measured lengths L at each frame t were combined into a list , L t . Any missing frames were ﬁlled by linear interpolation of the two closest measured lengths . The beginning of the list was extended backward in time by linear extrapolation of the ﬁrst two length measure - ments . The end of the list was extended forward in a similar fashion . The entire list was convolved with a derivative of a Gaussian ﬁlter , G t ¼ (cid:2) t s 2 1 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 ps 2 p exp (cid:2) t 2 2 s 2 (cid:3) (cid:4) ; ( 6 ) with a half - width , s , of two to three frames and divided by the average time between frames for the experiment . This simultaneously smoothed the data and calculated the change in length . Instantaneous rates for extrapolated frames were thrown out . RESULTS Improved hardware for imaging actin polymerization We modiﬁed the prism - based total internal reﬂection light source on an inverted epiﬂuorescence microscope ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . An inexpensive ( BK7 ) right - angle glass prism served as well as a quartz Pellin Broca prism . An active phase scrambler consisting of clear plastic plate spinning at . 1000 rpm after the beam expander scrambled the laser polarization and smoothed out intensity variations in the total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) illumination due to interference patterns and stray light . An automated ﬁlter cube turret and shutters for both the laser and arc lamp light sources allowed rapid switching between TIRF and epiﬂuorescence illumination . A stepper motor at - tached to the microscope ﬁne focus wheel permitted auto - mated focusing of the TIRF image . Actin labeled with Oregon green 488 on Cys - 374 incorporates into growing ﬁlaments The work described here was done with actin labeled on Cys - 374 with the stable ﬂuorescein derivative , Oregon green 488 iodoacetamide ( OG - actin ) .

The emission intensity of polymerized OG - actin was 4 . 5 times that of actin ﬁlaments labeled on Cys - 374 with rhodamine maleimide , the conjugate used by Amann and Pollard ( 2001 ) and others ( Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ) . TIRF microscopy allowed imaging of individual actin ﬁlaments polymerizing from mixtures of OG - actin mono - mers and unlabeled actin monomers ( Fig . 2 A ) . We observed the growth of ﬁlaments in the presence of 0 . 5 – 5 m M total Mg - ATP - actin including 10 – 50 % OG - actin . The contrast was excellent even with micromolar concentrations of unpolymerized ﬂuorescent actin in solution . On the other hand , the high background ﬂuorescence of unpolymerized molecules prevented imaging of polymerizing OG - actin ﬁlaments by epiﬂuorescence microscopy . We followed the growth of individual ﬁlaments by re - cording time - lapse images every 8 – 30 s , the interval de - pending on actin monomer concentration . Growth could be followed for more than an hour with 0 . 5 m M actin mono - mers , but with 5 m M actin monomers the density of labeled ﬁlaments on the surface of the slide obscured individual ﬁlaments by 7 min . Myosin attachment points distinguished growth at barbed and pointed ends A ﬁducial mark is required on each ﬁlament to distinguish the growth at the two ends . We used single N - ethyl - maleimide ( NEM ) - inactivated myosin II molecules to attach ﬁlaments to the chamber surface ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) , but locating and using these tethers as external reference marks required correction of stage drift . We developed software to track several stationary ﬂuorescent particles in the ﬁeld of view ( Fig . 3 A ) with subpixel accuracy . We took the average motion of these particles as the total drift over the course of an experiment and used this measurement to shift each image in the opposite direction and stabilize the entire movie ( Fig . 3 C ) . We combined each TIRF microscopy sequence into a single image with a maximum intensity pro - jection ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) , where each pixel in the projection image corresponded to the maximum intensity projection ( MIP ) at that location over all time points . The MIP image exposed the history of each ﬁlament and revealed constric - tion points where the Brownian motion of a swiveling ﬁl - ament was negligible ( Fig . 3 C , arrows ) . We veriﬁed that these restriction points were ﬁxed at a point on the ﬁlaments by changing the mol fraction of OG - actin midway through a polymerization experiment . Such sharp steps in ﬂuores - cence intensity rarely moved with respect to the constriction point of the ﬁlament , even over several hours ( Fig . 3 C ) . We used constriction points to separate the two ends during length measurements . We assumed that barbed ends grow faster than pointed ends . We developed software to measure the length of each ﬁlament end through several frames . The software converted a rough hand trace of a ﬁlament into a reﬁned measurement by snapping each point along the trace to the ﬁlament center and endpoints . The reﬁned trace was cut into two segments at the external ﬁducial point and the total length and lengths of each segment were computed . We repeated this process over several frames to obtain growth curves for both ends of each ﬁlament . We eliminated from analysis ﬁlaments that moved from their constriction points , due to detachment from myosin or incorrect assignment of an attachment point . Sliding of nongrowing ﬁlaments would appear as coordinated move - ments of the two ends relative to the point chosen as the constriction point . Detection of sliding is more difﬁcult for growing ﬁlaments . Filament sliding would appear as coordinated movements of the two ends superimposed on their linear growth curves ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) , but would not affect the total ﬁlament length . We detected nonlinearities in length traces by subtracting the length estimated by linear regression from the measured length . We used such residual plots to search for coordinated nonlinear movement of the barbed and pointed ends of a ﬁlament , and linear growth of the entire ﬁlament . Plots of length residuals at the two ends of ﬁlaments as a function of time revealed two classes of ﬁlaments . Some ﬁlaments remained ﬁxed at the constriction point . These ﬁlaments grew steadily at both ends over time ( Fig . 4 , A and C ) . Elongation was much faster at barbed ends and plots of length as a function of time barely deviated from linearity ( Fig . 4 A ) . Elongation was slow at pointed ends and the measurements were noisy owing to the small changes in length and measurement error . The residuals from barbed end length measurements and the negative residuals from pointed end length measurements were uncorrelated ( Fig . 4 E ) ; addition or subtraction of the residuals gave the same result , indicating that the errors were random . This test vali - dated the constriction points of such ﬁlaments as accurate ﬁducial marks . Other ﬁlaments slid along their lengths relative to their constriction points . Plots of length as a function of time deviated from linearity at both ends ( Fig . 4 , B and D ) , with coordinated ﬂuctuations in the distances between the constriction point to the two ends ( Fig . 4 F ) . The residuals from barbed end length measurements and the negative residuals from pointed end length measurements were cor - related ( Fig . 4 F ) . If the difference between the two end residual measurements was . 130 % of the measurement error for the total ﬁlament length ( equivalent to the sum of the two end residuals ) , the ﬁlament was deﬁned as not ﬁxed at the constriction point and rejected as unsuitable for mea - suring growth at the two ends . Autofocusing We used subresolution crimson ﬂuorescent beads as autofocusing targets during long - term TIRF recordings of actin ﬁlaments . We coated ﬂow cells with 5 – 20 beads per Actin Polymerization by TIRF Microscopy 1391 Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 ﬁeld concurrently with NEM - myosin - II . Before acquiring each TIRF image , the microscope took a Z - series of epiﬂuorescent images of the beads at a longer wave length , using short exposures and low light levels to avoid bleaching of Oregon green . We measured focus using a standard sharpness function . Because a focused image is sharper than an out - of - focus image , the total image derivative ( dI / dx ) 2 1 ( dI / dy ) 2 summed over all pixels is maximal at the correct focal plane . This two - pass autofocusing step proved robust even for extremely noisy images , took , 5 s , and kept ﬁlaments in focus more than several hours . This method avoids bleaching that would occur if the microscope were focused on the ﬁlaments before acquiring each image . Speckles Fluorescent speckles are an alternative to single molecule tethers as ﬁducial marks . With the mol fractions of labeled actin employed here , ‘‘speckles’’ of nonuniform labeling along ﬁlaments were rarely discernable in single images ( Fig . 2 A ) but were obvious in straightened intensity ky - mographs of ﬁlaments ( Fig . 2 B ) as persistent dark patches . Because speckle contrast was often low ( Fig . 2 B , arrow - heads ) and ﬁlament overlap could also produce speckles ( Fig . 2 B , arrow ) , myosin tethers were used as ﬁducial marks for this study . Nevertheless , these dark speckles rarely moved relative to the myosin tether points ( not shown ) , FIGURE 2 Imaging the time course of the polymerization of Mg - ATP - actin . Conditions : 1 . 5 m M ( 30 % Oregon green 488 labeled ) Mg - ATP - actin , 10mMimidazole , pH7 . 0 , 50mMKCl , 1mMMgCl 2 , 1mMEGTA , 100mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 50 m M CaCl 2 , 15 mM glucose , 20 m g / ml catalase , 100 m g / ml glucose oxidase , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose at 25 (cid:3) C .

( D ) Change in length of 13 ﬁlaments as a function of time . Individual growth traces were combined by subtracting each ﬁlament’s starting length ( based on the linear ﬁt ) from total length and start time from total time for each data point . Length measurements for stalled barbed ends were disregarded . A single rate of 3 . 974 6 0 . 010 sub (cid:5) s (cid:2) 1 ( solid line ) was assigned to the entire sequence ( N ¼ 925 ) by linear regression .

Steady growth interrupted by pauses The total length of most ﬁlaments increased at a constant rate for many minutes ( Fig . 2 C ) indicating that the actin monomer pool was not depleted . Pauses interrupted periods of steady growth at all concentrations of monomers ( Fig . 2 , C and E , arrowheads ) . We removed obvious pauses of three or more frames ( 24 – 90 s depending on the frame rate ) from rate analysis measurements . We analyzed the elongation data in experiments such as Fig . 2 in three ways : 1 ) , individual ﬁlament slopes ; 2 ) , pooled ﬁlaments slope ; and 3 ) , distribution of instantaneous growth rates . For 1 . 5 m M ( 30 % labeled ) Mg - ATP - actin , individual ﬁlaments ( method 1 ; Fig . 2 C ) elongated at an average of 3 . 9 6 0 . 4 subunits 3 s (cid:2) 1 ( N ¼ 13 ﬁlaments ) . Using the same data , all ﬁlaments in the ﬁeld were combined as the change of length of each ﬁlament with time ( method 2 ; Fig . 2 D ) . All of the points fell along the same line with a slope of 3 . 914 6 0 . 010 subunits (cid:5) s (cid:2) 1 ( N ¼ 925 data points ) , indicating that growth was uniform throughout the ﬁeld . Alternatively , we smoothed each ﬁlament length trace with a Gaussian window and calculated the change in length over each four - frame interval ( Fig . 2 E ) to obtain a distribution of rates ( method 3 ) . The instantaneous rates had a Gaussian distribution ( Fig . 2 F ) with an average change in length of 4 . 0 6 1 . 5 subunits (cid:5) s (cid:2) 1 ( N ¼ 925 data points ) . We consider the merits of each approach below . OG - actin monomers incorporate into ﬁlaments but do not contribute to elongation rates Like actin labeled with rhodamine on Cys - 374 ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) , actin labeled on Cys - 374 with Oregon green 488 depended on unlabeled actin for polymerization . At both 1 m M and 2 . 5 m M total Mg - ATP - actin , the elongation rates at the barbed end were inversely proportional to the fraction of labeled actin ( Fig . 5 C ) . Extrapolation of this linear trend line to 0 % label gave polymerization rates expected for native , unlabeled actin ( Pollard , 1986 ) . Linear extrapolation of this data gave no barbed end elongation at 90 % label , similar to rhodamine - Cys - 374 - actin ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) . Noise obscured any dependence of pointed end FIGURE 3 Drift correction reveals NEM - myosin attachment points useful as ﬁducial marks to separate barbed from pointed ends . Conditions : same buffer as Fig . 2 . Actin ﬁlaments with segments of different ﬂuo - rescence intensity were created by loading the chamber sequentially with polymerizing buffer containing 5 m M 25 % labeled actin , followed by 5 m M 50 % labeled actin , followed by 0 . 175 m M 25 % labeled actin . ( A ) Image of a ﬁeld at 10 s after addition of the ﬁnal actin concentration , showing sequentially labeled ﬁlaments . Dim segments of the ﬁlaments are pointed ends , bright segments are barbed ends . Annealing created ﬁlaments with multiple bright segments . Bright spots of ﬂuorescent material from the actin sample ( arrows ) remained stationary relative to each other . ( B ) The intensity of each image in the sequence ( 25 frames ; 2 h total ) was normalized and the sequence was combined into a single image with a maximum intensity projection . In this life - history image , both ﬁlaments and the bright spots moved as the stage drifted . ( C ) Maximum intensity projection . Several bright spots were tracked with subpixel accuracy and the average positions were used to estimate the drift at each time point . Each image was shifted in the reverse direction to compensate for the drift . Several ﬁlaments exhibited constriction points ( arrows ) around which the ﬁlaments rotated over time . Labeled ﬁducial marks ( the boundaries of segments differing in intensity ) did not move with respect to these constriction points over 2 h . Scale bar is 20 m m . Actin Polymerization by TIRF Microscopy 1393 Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 elongation rates on the fraction of labeled actin ( Fig . 5 D ) . We were unable to obtain 100 % labeled OG - actin to demon - strate directly its incapacity of polymerize . Barbed end elongation above the critical concentration To obtain the association and dissociation rate constants for Mg - ATP - actin polymerization , we measured barbed and pointed end growth of 30 % labeled Mg - ATP - actin over a 10 - fold range of actin concentrations ( 0 . 5 – 5 m M ; Fig . 5 A ) . Assuming linear growth ( see Fig . 2 , B and C ) , we estimated the measurement error from the residuals of plots of ﬁlament lengths versus time . The average errors for single measure - ments of length were 150 6 60 subunits for barbed ends and 140 6 70 subunits for pointed ends ( N ¼ 318 ﬁlaments ) , about twice the microscope’s resolution limit of 81 subunits ( 220 nm ) . These measurement errors were small compared to the length changes at barbed ends ( Fig . 5 A ) but large relative to the length changes at pointed ends ( Fig . 5 B ) . In each of three experiments , plots of elongation rates versus total actin concentration ( labeled 1 unlabeled ) were linear but the slopes differed between experiments . Fitting FIGURE 4 Residual analysis of length as a function of time data is used to separate afﬁxed and sliding ﬁlaments .

FIGURE 5 Dependence of polymerization rates on actin concentration and fraction of labeling . Conditions : Mg - ATP - actin in same buffer as Fig . 2 . ( A and B ) Dependence of elongation rates at ( A ) the barbed end and ( B ) pointed end on the concentration of 30 % labeled actin ( f OG ¼ 0 : 3 ) . Eight to 15 ﬁlaments ﬁxed at their constriction points were selected at each concentration . Barbed and pointed end lengths of each ﬁlament were measured over 10 – 60 frames , and rates were obtained by averaging smoothed instantaneous growth rates for every measurement . Three trials using two different actin preparations are shown . Rate constants ( h , solid line ) for trial 1 of k B 1 ¼ 5 : 4 6 0 : 4 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ; k B (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 8 6 1 : 2s (cid:2) 1 ; k P 1 ¼ 0 : 17 6 0 : 05 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ; k P (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 14 6 0 : 16s (cid:2) 1 ; ( d , dashed line ) for trial 2 of k B 1 ¼ 8 : 5 6 1 : 8 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ; k B (cid:2) ¼ 7 6 5s (cid:2) 1 ; k P 1 ¼ 1 : 0 6 0 : 3 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ; k P (cid:2) ¼ 1 : 2 6 0 : 8s (cid:2) 1 ; and ( s , dashed - dotted line ) for trial 3 of k B 1 ¼ 3 : 4 6 0 : 2 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ; k B (cid:2) ¼ 1 : 8 6 0 : 7s (cid:2) 1 ; k P 1 ¼ 0 : 79 6 0 : 16 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ; k P (cid:2) ¼ 1 : 0 6 0 : 5s (cid:2) 1 were obtained by linear regression . Standard distributions of instantaneous rate measurements are shown for trial 3 . Similar distributions were seen for trial 1 and trial 2 . Trials 2 and 3 were from the same preparation on separate days . ( C and D ) Dependence of elongation rates at the ( C ) barbed end and ( D ) pointed end on the mol fraction of labeled actin . Mg - ATP - actin with 10 – 50 % of the molecules labeled was polymerized at ( s , dashed line ) 1 m M and ( d , solid line ) 2 . 5 m M total actin and average smoothed instantaneous growth rates were ﬁtted with linear regression . 1394 Kuhn and Pollard Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 the average instantaneous growth rate ( method 3 ; Fig . 2 F ) at each concentration to a line gave superior correlation coefﬁcients than either ﬁtting to individual ﬁlaments ( method 1 ; Fig . 2 C ) or pooled ﬁlaments ( method 2 ; Fig . 2 D ) at each concentration . For 30 % labeled actin , the barbed end association rate constants for trials 1 – 3 were k b ; 30 % 1 ¼ 5 : 4 6 0 : 4 ; 8 : 5 6 1 : 8 ; and 3 . 4 6 0 . 2 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 , re - spectively , and the barbed end dissociation rate constants for trials 1 – 3 were k b ; 30 % (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 8 6 1 : 2 ; 8 6 5 ; and 1 . 8 6 0 . 8 s (cid:2) 1 . Knowing that labeled actin did not contribute to elongation rates , we combined the rates for all measured actin concentrations and labeled fractions ( Fig . 5 , A – D ) into a single plot of rate versus concentration of unlabeled Mg - ATP - actin . For barbed ends ( Fig . 8 C , circles ) , every ﬁlament showed the same dependence of rate on the concentration of unlabeled actin , regardless of the concen - tration of OG - actin in the experiment . From this combined plot , the barbed end association rate constant for unlabeled actin was k b 1 ¼ 7 : 5 6 0 : 7 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and the dissociation rate constant was k b (cid:2) ¼ 1 : 0 6 1 : 2 s (cid:2) 1 : Pointed ends grew slowly and measurement errors were large compared to the average change in length . Individual pointed end growth rates varied signiﬁcantly more than barbed end growth rates due at least in part to this measurement error . Nevertheless , pointed end growth rates increased with actin concentration ( Fig . 5 B ) . A linear ﬁt to this data gave pointed end rate constants for trials 1 – 3 of k p ; 30 % 1 ¼ 0 : 17 6 0 : 05 ; 1 : 0 6 0 : 3 ; and 0 . 79 6 0 . 16 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and k p ; 30 % (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 14 6 0 : 16 ; 1 : 2 6 0 : 8 ; and 1 . 0 6 0 . 5 s (cid:2) 1 , respectively . A combined plot of rate as a function of unlabeled actin ( Fig . 8 D , circles ) gave rate constants of k p 1 ¼ 0 : 66 6 0 : 14 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and k p (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 7 6 0 : 2 s (cid:2) 1 : Subunit dissociation from barbed and pointed ends in the absence of free Mg - ATP - actin monomers To measure subunit dissociation in the absence of associa - tion , we used 5 m M vitamin D binding protein ( DBP ) ( K d ; 1 nM for ADP - actin monomers ; McLeod et al . , 1989 ) to sequester monomers as they dissociated from ﬁlament ends . Actin ﬁlaments assembled on the slide from 25 % labeled Mg - ATP - actin were aged under treadmilling conditions ( 0 . 18 m M Mg - ATP - actin monomers ) for 22 min ( 5 3 half - times for phosphate release ) to convert them predominantly to ADP - actin . We marked barbed ends brieﬂy with 50 % labeled Mg - ATP - actin , before washing out actin monomers and adding DBP in buffer containing either ATP or ADP . Although different labeled fractions at barbed ends might complicate measurements , less than one - third of the mea - sured ﬁlaments were marked , and the brightly labeled seg - ments depolymerized quickly . Because depolymerization of some ﬁlaments slowed or stopped after ; 20 min , we mea - sured depolymerization rates during the ﬁrst 1000 s . Marked barbed ends of ADP ﬁlaments shortened at rates of 2 s (cid:2) 1 in ATP buffer , whereas pointed ends shortened at 0 . 2 s (cid:2) 1 . Based on this 10 - fold difference in depolymerization rates , we designated the rapidly depolymerizing ends of unmarked ﬁlaments as barbed ends and combined marked and unmarked ﬁlaments for further analysis . The distribution of smoothed instantaneous rates at barbed ends was Gauss - ian with a mean dissociation rate of 1 . 23 6 2 . 88 s (cid:2) 1 ( mean 6 SD ; Fig . 6 A ) . The distribution was skewed slightly toward a dissociation rate of zero , consistent with long pauses in depolymerization observed for several ﬁlaments . All pointed end depolymerization rates clustered in one peak with a mean of 0 . 06 6 1 . 89 s (cid:2) 1 ( Fig . 6 B ) . In buffer containing ADP Mg - ADP - actin ﬁlaments also shortened faster at their barbed ends ( 1 . 52 6 2 . 86 s (cid:2) 1 ; Fig . 6 C ) than at their pointed ends ( 0 . 26 6 2 . 20 s (cid:2) 1 ; Fig . 6 D ) . Subunits treadmill through actin ﬁlaments under nonequilibrium conditions Theoretical studies of actin polymerization predicted ( Wegner , 1976 ) and measurements of rate constants veriﬁed ( Pollard , 1986 ; Pollard and Mooseker , 1981 ) that once actin ﬁlaments reach a steady state , the concentration of Mg - ATP - actin monomers is slightly above the critical concentration at the barbed end and well below the critical concentration at the pointed end . Under these conditions a population of ﬁlaments has net elongation of barbed ends matched by net shortening of pointed ends . Although total polymer concentration remains constant , subunits treadmill through ﬁlaments from the barbed to the pointed end . Fujiwara et al . ( 2002 ) were the ﬁrst to observe single ﬁlaments growing at their barbed ends and shrinking at their pointed ends by TIRF microscopy . We extended this work by observing the behavior of ﬁlaments over a range of Mg - ATP - actin monomer concen - trations from 0 . 025 to 0 . 2 m M . Under these conditions the critical concentration at the barbed end is 0 . 1 m M and the critical concentration at the pointed end is 0 . 8 m M . To distinguish the two ends of these ﬁlaments , we pulse - labeled long ﬁlaments with 50 % labeled actin at the pointed end and 35 % labeled actin at the barbed end , then exchanged the solution in the chamber with a low concentration of 25 % labeled actin monomers to observe ﬁlaments under treadmil - ling conditions ( Fig . 7 ) . The ends of the ﬁlaments changed length very slowly . For example , in 150 nM Mg - ATP - actin , pointed ends take ; 40 min to shorten 1 m m . Thus , accurate measurements of treadmilling rates by TIRF microscopy required autofocusing to collect images for more than an hour . The behavior of the two ends depended on the actin monomer concentration . With Mg - ATP - actin monomer concentrations # 100 nM ( 75 nM unlabeled actin ) , both ends shortened . At slightly higher concentrations , barbed ends elongated and pointed ends shortened . Fig . 7 A shows time series of four ﬁlaments treadmilling in 150 nM total monomeric actin . At this concentration , barbed ends Actin Polymerization by TIRF Microscopy 1395 Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 elongated at 0 . 839 6 0 . 013 s (cid:2) 1 ( N ¼ 10 ﬁlaments ) , faster than the average rate of shortening of pointed ends , 0 . 125 6 0 . 012 s (cid:2) 1 ( N ¼ 10 ﬁlaments ) . ‘‘Straightened’’ kymographs of these ﬁlaments ( Fig . 7 B ) show that barbed ends elongated at a constant rate , whereas pointed ends shortened intermittently . Uncertainty in the measurements of length changes at pointed ends precluded a detailed analysis of these pauses . To avoid potential effects of marked ends on treadmilling , we used ﬁlaments uniformly labeled with a single mol fraction OG - actin and myosin attachment points as ﬁducial marks . Uniformly labeled ﬁlaments treadmilled like end - labeled ﬁlaments ( not shown ) . At low concentrations of Mg - ATP - actin monomers , barbed end elongation rates depended on the mol fraction of unlabeled actin monomers , as at high concentrations . The effect of labeled subunits on elongation at the pointed ends was ambiguous due to the scatter of the depolymerization rates . Assigning ends from polymerization rates is ambiguous at low actin concentrations . Although barbed ends grow faster at all concentrations above the critical concentration , they also shorten faster than pointed ends below some ‘‘cross - over’’ concentration owing to a higher dissociation rate constant . To determine the crossover concentration , we swapped barbed and pointed end assignments for concen - trations at or below some arbitrary concentration and reanalyzed the rate as a function of concentration data for both ends . The best linear ﬁts , measured from the sum of the correlation coefﬁcients ( R 2 values ) at both ends , were achieved with a crossover concentration of 50 nM unlabeled actin ð R 2b ¼ 0 : 91 ; R 2p ¼ 0 : 53 Þ : Below this concentration barbed ends depolymerized faster . Plots of elongation rate versus concentration of unlabeled Mg - ATP - actin at these low actin concentrations ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) gave the following rate constants : barbed end association rate constant k b 1 ¼ 13 : 9 6 1 : 7 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ; barbed end dissociation rate constant k b (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 89 6 0 : 15 s (cid:2) 1 ; pointed end association rate constant k p 1 ¼ 0 : 7 6 0 : 5 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ; and pointed end dissociation rate k p (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 19 6 0 : 04 s (cid:2) 1 : We did not observe balanced barbed end polymerization and pointed end depolymerization at any concentration , thus ﬁlaments never reached a steady state with the monomer pool during our observation window . Although barbed ends switched from depolymerization to elongation at higher concentra - tions , pointed ends did not elongate under these conditions . Global analysis of combined elongation data We combined our elongation data for all actin concentrations to arrive at a global ﬁt of rate as a function the concentration of unlabeled actin monomers ( Fig . 8 , C and D ) . The barbed end association rate constant was k b 1 ¼ 7 : 4 6 0 : 5 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and the dissociation rate constant was k b (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 8 6 0 : 8 s (cid:2) 1 : The pointed end association rate constant was k p 1 ¼ 0 : 56 6 0 : 10 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and the dissociation rate constant was k p (cid:2) ¼ 0 : 44 6 0 : 17 s (cid:2) 1 : The linear ﬁt to the barbed end data ( R 2 ¼ 0 . 83 ) was more robust than the pointed end data ( R 2 ¼ 0 . 39 ) . Table 1 compares our TIRF microscopy measure - ments with rate constants measured by electron microscopy . DISCUSSION To observe polymerization and depolymerization of single actin ﬁlaments over a wider range of actin monomer con - centrations , we improved the total internal reﬂection ﬂuo - rescence microscopy method ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ) . This required a new actin labeling FIGURE 6 Direct measurement of subunit dissociation . Conditions : 1 . 5 m M Mg - ATP - actin ( 25 % fraction label ) in the same buffer as Fig . 2 was polymerized on the slide for 10 min , followed by incubation with 0 . 18 m M ( 25 % label ) Mg - ATP - actin for 22 min to maintain ﬁlament length during phosphate release and followed by 1 . 5 m M ( 50 % label ) Mg - ATP - actin for 1 – 2 min to mark barbed ends . Filaments were depolymerized in either ATP or ADP buffer with 5 m M vitamin D binding protein to sequester free actin monomers . Barbed ends of marked ﬁlaments depolymerized faster than pointed ends . Unmarked ﬁlament ends were categorized as barbed or pointed based on their average depolymerization rate . Smoothed in - stantaneous growth rates ( see Fig . 2 ) of marked and unmarked ﬁlaments were combined , binned into 0 . 5 s (cid:2) 1 increments , and plotted as a histogram ( shaded bars ) of observation frequency for the ( A and C ) barbed and ( B and D ) pointed end . Gaussian distributions ( solid lines ) of equivalent mean and standard deviation are shown for comparison .

Actin labeled on Cys - 374 with Oregon green 488 iodoacetamide is brighter than rhodamine labeled actin used in earlier TIRF studies . Like rhodamine actin , OG - actin incorporated into actin ﬁlaments but did not contribute to the elongation rate . We extrapolated the rate constants measured at several mol fractions of labeled actin to obtain the rate constants for native actin polymerization , which depended solely on the concentration of unlabeled actin in the reaction . Each ﬁlament needs a stable ﬁducial mark to distinguish growth at the two ends . For this purpose Fujiwara et al . ( 2002 ) used bright ﬁducial spots on rare actin ﬁlaments to demonstrate steady - state treadmilling . We used two methods to distinguish barbed and pointed ends of numerous ﬁlaments . In some experiments we pulse - labeled ﬁlaments with different fractions of labeled actin to mark a stable boundary . For uniformly labeled ﬁlaments , we located points where NEM - inactivated myosin attached ﬁlaments to the glass surface as stable external ﬁducial marks . Residual analysis of growth curves distinguished these myosin attachment points from nonspeciﬁc binding of ﬁlaments to glass . Although subtle , the intensity variations along each ﬁlament revealed by kymographs ( Fig . 2 B ) are internal ﬁducial marks that are potentially superior to external marks . We used these methods to obtain simultaneously the rate constants for both ﬁlament ends in each experiment , allowing measurement of hundreds of ﬁlaments . At all actin monomer concentrations occasional pauses separated peri - ods of constant growth or shrinkage . Although pauses were more frequent at barbed ends , pauses also occurred during long - term pointed end depolymerization under ﬁlament treadmilling conditions . Measurement noise likely obscured many pointed end pauses , owing to very slow changes in length relative to measurement errors . What accounts for these pauses ? Contaminating capping protein ( McLean - Fletcher and Pollard , 1980 ) might cause barbed end pauses , but the 38 - s average half - life of barbed end pauses ( not shown ) is far shorter than the 4500 - s half - time for capping protein dissociation ( Schafer et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , reducing capping protein contamination by double gel ﬁltration of actin did not reduce the frequency or duration of pauses . Association with inactive myosin might cause pauses . Many growing ﬁlaments paused when an end afﬁxed to a single point , consistent with myosin binding . Some ﬁlaments shortening at low actin concentrations also paused at a presumptive NEM - myosin attachment point . Since we and others ( Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ) observed pauses in the absence of myosin , pauses are more likely due to nonspeciﬁc , unfavorable interactions of ﬁlament ends with the glass surface . Consistent with this interpretation , growth pauses and ﬁlament attachment ( seen as decreased Brownian motion ) are more common in winter , when lower humidity can increase electrostatic charges on the glass surfaces . Real - time ﬂuorescence microscopy conﬁrmed that the rate constant for elongation of barbed ends by Mg - ATP - actin of 7 . 4 6 0 . 5 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 is ; 10 times larger than the pointed end association rate constant of 0 . 56 6 0 . 10 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 . These values fall within the range of previous measurement , for example 3 . 4 – 12 . 3 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 at the barbed end ( see Pollard , 1986 ; Table 2 ) . Both TIRF microscopy values are ; 65 % the values measured by electron microscopy . Undetectable pauses could partially account for the lower rates measured by TIRF microscopy , but EM measurements could have overestimated growth rates . For electron microscopy , ﬁla - ments were grown from blunt - ended fragments of Limulus acrosomal processes and bundled with poly - L - lysine . The maximum length of the tapered bundle was measured at each time point . Given the distribution of ﬁlament growth rates we observed in individual TIRF experiments ( see Fig . 5 , A and FIGURE 7 Treadmilling of subunits through actin ﬁlaments at low concentrations of monomers .

Actin Polymerization by TIRF Microscopy 1397 Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 B ) , it is likely that measuring the longest ﬁlament in EM overestimated growth rates . Fitting our rate constants to the fastest ﬁlament in each experiment ( Fig . 8 , C and D , circles ) gave rate constants ( k b 1 of 10 . 7 m M (cid:5) s (cid:2) 1 and k p 1 of 1 . 5 m M (cid:5) s (cid:2) 1 ) similar to the EM method . Polymerization rate constants measured by ﬂuorescence microscopy varied from experiment to experiment ( Fig . 5 ) . Environmental conditions such as humidity , temperature , and charge on the glass substrate are more likely to explain the var - iation in our measurements than differences in actin activity , because we obtained trials 2 and 3 on successive days using the same actin preparation . Thus , internal controls are essen - tial when using microscopy to study the effects of solution conditions or regulatory proteins on actin polymerization rates . As TIRF microscopy becomes a standard method for actin kinetics , polymerization rates of actin alone should be routinely remeasured for each set of experimental conditions . Methods to measure dissociation rate constants Previous estimates of subunit dissociation rates relied on bulk samples with unknown numbers of ﬁlament ends ( Carlier et al . , 1986 ; Teubner and Wegner , 1998 ) or on microscopic measurements of elongation rates at actin mono - mer concentrations above the critical concentration and linear extrapolation of these rates to zero monomer ( Pollard , 1986 ) . We observed subunit dissociation directly in excess vitamin D binding protein to sequester monomers and preclude association reactions . This allowed us to test the effects of nucleotides on subunit dissociation . Dissociation rate constants obtained by extrapolation of linear plots of growth rates versus actin monomer concen - trations to zero monomer concentration are inherently more sensitive to measurement noise than those obtained by direct measurement . Our association rate constants varied 2 . 5 - fold between different trials , whereas our dissociation rate constants obtained by extrapolation varied 10 - fold between trials . Over seven trials of Mg - ATP - actin growth by EM , Pollard ( 1986 ) observed a 1 . 3 - fold range of barbed - end association rate constants and a 10 - fold range of extrapolated barbed - end dissociation rate constants . Depolymerization at barbed ends We created Mg - ADP - actin ﬁlaments by incubating ﬁlaments assembled from Mg - ATP - actin monomers for 22 min in a concentration of ATP - actin monomers where pointed ends depolymerized and barbed - end polymerization was slow and stochastic , growing at most 500 subunits ( not shown ) . During this ageing step most subunits in the ﬁlaments hydrolyzed their bound ATP ( 1000 half - lives ) and dissoci - ated the g - phosphate ( ﬁve half - lives ) to become ADP - actin . Short barbed end caps that grew during ageing consisted of a mixture of Mg - ATP - Mg - ADP - Pi - and Mg - ADP - actin . Some of these short caps broke off when the actin monomers were washed out ; the rest depolymerized within 300 s . We did not conﬁrm that the ATP in the buffer slows dissociation of Mg - ADP - actin subunits at the barbed end as reported by Teubner and Wegner ( 1998 ) . When vitamin D binding protein sequestered free subunits , Mg - ADP - actin dissociated from barbed ends at 1 . 2 s (cid:2) 1 in ATP buffer and 1 . 5 s (cid:2) 1 in ADP buffer . A two - tailed student’s t - test showed little signiﬁcant difference between these two conditions ( p - value of 0 . 071 ) . Inferred dissociation rate constants at barbed ends To evaluate the dissociation rate constants for Mg - ATP - actin , we observed changes in the length of ﬁlaments at Mg - ATP - actin monomer concentrations near or below the critical concentration . Under these conditions , Mg - ATP - actin asso - ciates with barbed ends at a rate proportional to its con - centration . Because the half times are ; 2 s for hydrolysis FIGURE 8 Dependence of elongation rates on actin concentration .

The linear regression is the solid line and the upper and lower 95 % conﬁdence intervals are dashed lines . 1398 Kuhn and Pollard Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 2002 ) and 5 min for phosphate dis - sociation ( Melkietal . , 1996 ) , mostterminal subunitswill have bound ATP or ADP - Pi ( Bindschadler et al . , 2004 ) . Linear extrapolation of the rate of elongation ( including negative values below the critical concentration ) of plots of rate versus actin concentration to zero actin gave a dissociation rate constant of 0 . 9 s (cid:2) 1 for these species on the end of the ﬁlament . This is two - thirds the average rate of ADP - actin dissociation we observed in the presence of DBP to sequester monomers . Thus , even rare associations of ATP monomers protect barbed ends from the higher rate of ADP - actin dissociation . Previous estimates of Mg - ATP - actin barbed end dissoci - ation rate constants based on extrapolation of polymerization conditions showed similar rate constants of 1 . 4 s (cid:2) 1 ( Pollard , 1986 ) or 0 . 14 – 4 . 6 s (cid:2) 1 ( Carlier et al . , 1986 ) . Our direct mea - surement of Mg - ADP - actin dissociation from barbed ends was only 1 . 5 - fold higher than the ‘‘ATP - actin’’ dissociation rate , rather than the three - to fourfold higher values for Mg - ADP - actin than Mg - ATP - actin dissociation reported previously ( 7 . 2 s (cid:2) 1 , Pollard , 1986 ; 6 . 0 s (cid:2) 1 , Carlier et al . , 1986 ; or 11 . 5 s (cid:2) 1 , Teubner and Wegner , 1998 ) . Depolymerization at pointed ends Similar to the barbed end , the rates of subunit dissociation from the pointed ends were equivalent in buffer with ATP or ADP at ; 0 . 16 s (cid:2) 1 . Although the mean dissociation rate of Mg - ADP - actin was greater ( 0 . 06 s (cid:2) 1 ) in ATP buffer than ADP buffer ( 0 . 26 s (cid:2) 1 ) , a two - tailed Student’s t - test showed that these two distributions were indistinguishable ( p - value of 0 . 082 ) . A possibility of small effect of ATP in the buffer on pointed end depolymerization is intriguing and merits further study , because the nucleotide or phosphate exchange seem more plausible at pointed ends where the nucleotide binding cleft is more exposed on the terminal subunits ( Fig . 9 ) than at barbed ends ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) . However , events at the pointed end are likely to remain enigmatic , because the reactions are slow and the mol fraction of subunits occupying either end is miniscule compared with internal subunits ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 2002 ) . Inferred dissociation rate constants at pointed ends To evaluate the dissociation rate constants for Mg - ATP - actin , we observed changes in the length of ﬁlaments at Mg - ATP - actin monomer concentrations near or below the critical concentration . Because association and dissociation reactions are very slow at pointed ends , ﬁlaments assembled from ATP - actin have more terminal subunits with bound ADP - Pi than ATP or ADP , but the mix depends on the concentrations of ADP monomers and ﬁlament ends ( Bind - schadler et al . , 2004 ) . Linear extrapolation of the rate of pointed end length changes with time ( including negative values below the critical concentration ) to zero actin gave a dissociation rate constant of 0 . 19 s (cid:2) 1 for the mixture of species on the end of the ﬁlament , similar to the average rate of 0 . 16 s (cid:2) 1 seen for Mg - ADP - actin . Unlike the barbed end , Mg - ATP - or Mg - ADP - Pi - monomers do not protect the pointed end from depolymerization . Subunit diffusion on ﬁlament ends Our main approach was to measure rate constants directly . An alternative pioneered by Fujiwara et al . ( 2002 ) is to observe changes in the length of single actin ﬁlaments at steady state . Fujiwara et al . analyzed such changes as one - dimensional Fick’s diffusion processes . They estimated a diffusion coefﬁcient of 25 sub 2 s (cid:2) 1 with 0 . 7 m M Ca - ATP - actin at steady state . From this diffusion coefﬁcient , they estimated barbed end rate constants for Ca - ATP - actin of k D 1 ¼ 180 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and k D (cid:2) ¼ 25 s (cid:2) 1 at steady state . A similar analysis with 0 . 3 m M Mg - ATP - actin gave a diffusion coefﬁcient of 29 sub 2 (cid:5) s (cid:2) 1 at steady state and elongation rate constants of k D 1 ¼ 450 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and k D (cid:2) ¼ 29 s (cid:2) 1 : These values were 40 - fold larger than those obtained from mea - surements of ﬁlament elongation .

We conﬁrmed that single ﬁlaments can treadmill , growing at their barbed ends and shrinking at their pointed ends . Although our ﬁlaments never reached steady state , we performed the diffusion analysis of Fujiwara et al . ( 2002 ) for the actin concentration closest to steady state treadmilling ( 0 . 15 m M ) and obtained a diffusion constant of 31 sub 2 (cid:5) s (cid:2) 1 and diffusion - based rate constants k D 1 ¼ 230 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 and k D (cid:2) ¼ 31 s (cid:2) 1 ( not shown ) . In our experiment , barbed ends grew at an average rate of 0 . 8 s (cid:2) 1 , whereas pointed ends shortened at an average rate of 0 . 13 s (cid:2) 1 , far from the 40 - fold difference in rate constants of Fujiwara et al . To account for the differences between rate constants measured directly and by diffusion , Fujiwara et al . ( 2002 ) proposed that the unit of polymerization is , on average , ﬁve to six subunits rather than one . We observed several ﬁlament annealing events at high actin concentrations , but large - scale annealing events were far more frequent at low actin con - centrations where we observed ﬁlaments over longer time courses . Although we removed obvious annealing events from our analysis , undetectable annealing of short segments is conceivable . Any phenomena that increases the deviation between individual ﬁlament growth rates over time creates an apparent diffusion constant larger that one subunit . The stochastic pauses in ﬁlament growth described above are one such phenomenon . Although we removed most of the obvious ﬁlament pauses from our analysis of linear growth , pauses either shorter than the frame period of 8 – 30 s or hidden by measurement error would have increased the dispersion in growth rates between individual ﬁlaments and effectively decreased the apparent association rate constants . Our measured association rate constants were lower at both ends than those measured by EM ( Pollard , 1986 ) , supporting the idea that undetectable pauses contributed to ﬁlament growth and thus to the large diffusion constant . Measurement error that increases with time can also contribute to large apparent diffusion constants . We and others ( Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ) estimate ﬁlament length by piecewise linear approximation , but ﬁlament bending can FIGURE 9 Reactions for Mg - actin polymerization and nucleotide cycling .

K r , p indicate equilibrium constants for reactants r and products p ; k 1 r , p , association rate ; k (cid:2) r , p , dissociation rate ; ? , unknown rate constants ; Ø , highly unfavorable reactions ; * , calculated rate or equilibrium constants . 1400 Kuhn and Pollard Biophysical Journal 88 ( 2 ) 1387 – 1402 lead to considerable measurement error . Changes in length measured over short periods have small errors , owing to the similar ﬁlament curvature , whereas slow changes in curvature introduce considerably more error into length changes measured over longer time spans . The persistence length of actin ﬁlaments is 10 m m ( Isambert et al . , 1995 ; Liu and Pollack , 2002 ; Yanagida et al . , 1984 ) , meaning that ﬁlaments can bend 10 (cid:3) in as little as 1 . 2 m m . We observed Brownian bending along the entire length of growing actin ﬁlaments , and as ﬁlaments treadmilled through subunits , their curvature evolved slowly ( Fig . 2 A ) . Kymographs of ﬁlaments ‘‘straightened’’ by piecewise linear approximation ( Figs . 2 B and 7 B ) show that stable ﬁducial marks along a ﬁlament fail to align at later time points , illustrating the increase in measurement error from slow changes in ﬁlament curvature . Annealing , pauses , and bending contribute to larger devia - tion in growth rates as ﬁlaments elongate . A more detailed TIRF microscopy study of ﬁlament annealing and pauses , along with improved spline - based estimates of ﬁlament length should clear up this ambiguity between estimated diffusion and observed rate constants . Steady - state behavior The behavior of the ends of actin ﬁlaments at steady state in the presence of ATP and actin monomers is very complicated owing to a large number of interconnected reactions ( Fig . 9 ) . Mathematical models of ﬁlament behavior depend on accurate measurements of subunit association and dissoci - ation , ATP binding to monomers , ATP hydrolysis by actin polymerized subunits , dissociation and reassociation of the g - phosphate on monomeric and polymerized ADP - actin subunits , and dissociation of ADP from actin monomers ( Bindschadler et al . , 2004 ) . Some of the assumptions and reaction rates required to complete the analysis of this complex system are still lacking ( Fig . 9 , question marks ) , whereas other rates gathered from the literature may bear further scrutiny . One unresolved issue is the afﬁnity of ADP - actin monomers for phosphate . Wanger and Wegner ( 1987 ) used polymerization assays to estimate the afﬁnities of phosphate for ADP - actin ﬁlaments ( K d ¼ 10 mM ; i . e . , K 8 , 5 ) and monomers ( K d ¼ 100 mM ; i . e . , K 7 , 4 ) . However , they did not determine which ionic species of Pi participates , nor did they correct for the contributions of sodium - phosphate to the ionic strength . Carlier and Pantaloni ( 1988 ) did balance the ionic strength and identiﬁed H 2 PO (cid:2) 4 as the only species that binds ADP - actin ﬁlaments . The afﬁnity of H 2 PO (cid:2) 4 for ADP - actin ﬁlaments is 0 . 5 mM ( i . e . , K 8 , 5 ) , 20 - fold stronger than the 10 mM measured by Wanger and Wegner ( 1987 ) . Since in Wanger and Wegner’s calculation the afﬁnity of phosphate for monomers depended on its afﬁnity for ﬁlaments , the afﬁnity of H 2 PO (cid:2) 4 for ADP - actin monomer may also be 20 times higher ( i . e . , K 7 , 4 ¼ 5 mM ) . An important goal for the ﬁeld is to ﬁll in these missing experimental parameters . We profusely thank our anonymous reviewers for their many valuable observations and comments .
