Up until now , how this heterogeneity in chromatin conformation is shaped by chromatin condensation , TAD insulation , and transcription has remained mostly elusive . Here , we used Hi - M , a multiplexed DNA - FISH imaging technique providing developmental timing and transcriptional status , to show that the emergence of TADs at the ensemble level partially segregates the conformational space explored by single nuclei during the early development of Drosophila embryos . Surprisingly , a substantial fraction of nuclei displayed strong insulation even before TADs emerged . Moreover , active transcription within a TAD led to minor changes to the local inter - and intra - TAD chromatin conformation in single nuclei and only weakly affected insulation to the neighboring TAD . Overall , our results indicate that multiple parameters contribute to shaping the chromatin architecture of single nuclei at the TAD scale . Introduction Chromatin in interphase nuclei is organized at multiple levels , including chromosome territories , A / B compartments , and topologically associating domains ( TADs ) 1 . TADs , first observed in ensemble - averaged Hi - C contact maps 2 – 4 , are sub - megabase genomic regions of preferred contacts and three - dimensional ( 3D ) proximity . In mammalian cells , loop extrusion by the cohesin / CTCF system contributes to TAD formation 5 . TADs often encapsulate cis - regulatory elements ( CREs ) , thereby facilitating interactions between enhancers and promoters that are critical for transcriptional regulation 6 – 11 . At the same time , TAD borders may also restrict interactions between CREs located in neighboring TADs 12 – 14 . The precise interplay between TADs , enhancer - promoter ( EP ) contacts , and transcriptional activation is currently under intense study 15 . Cell type - specific EP contacts have been observed 16 – 18 and direct visualization of EP interactions suggests that sustained physical proximity is necessary for transcription 19 . On the other hand , other studies suggested that enhancer action may not require loop formation between enhancers and promoters 20 – 22 . TADs arise during early stages of development , concomitantly with the activation of zygotic gene expression 23 , 24 ; however , emergence of TADs seems to be independent of transcription itself in most organisms 23 , 25 – 27 . Remarkably , chromatin structure at the TAD scale is cell - type independent 28 , 29 and does not change upon transcriptional activation 29 during early Drosophila development . Thus , it is still unclear whether formation of TADs contribute to transcriptional regulation and what is the role played by single - cell heterogeneity . Several lines of evidence clearly established that chromosome organization is highly heterogeneous between cells . On the one hand , single - cell Hi - C 30 revealed that the conformation of individual TADs and loops varies substantially during interphase 31 , 32 , along the cell cycle 33 , and during early development 34 . On the other hand , imaging - based technologies showed that physical chromatin contacts within and between TADs are rare 35 , 36 , and display large cell - to - cell variability 35 – 38 . Finally , a high degree of heterogeneity in chromatin organization at the TAD scale was also present in polymer model simulations 39 – 41 . Overall , these studies suggest that TADs may exist in the ensemble but not in single cells . This hypothesis was recently challenged using super - resolution microscopy . Several studies observed that chromosomes folded into ‘nano - compartments’ possibly representing ‘TAD - like domains’ 42 , 43 . The condensation of chromatin within nano - domains tends to correlate with epigenetic state 42 . Borders between nano - compartments appear to be permissible , with a substantial overlap between neighboring regions 42 , 44 , 45 . Consistently , borders between nano - compartments detected in single cells do not necessarily align with ensemble TAD boundaries 38 . Thus , TAD - like domains exist but display different structural properties between different single cells . How these structural properties relate to single - cell chromatin structures and to transcriptional regulation is currently unclear . Here , we used Hi - M , a microscopy - based chromosome conformation capture method , to study single - nucleus chromatin organization at the sub - megabase scale before and after emergence of TADs during Drosophila embryogenesis . We found a large heterogeneity in single - nucleus chromatin conformations , independent of the presence of a TAD border in the population - average . Remarkably , despite this heterogeneity , chromatin structures of nuclei from different developmental stages segregate in a high - dimensional conformation space . This segregation cannot be assigned to any specific structural parameter . Notably , the single - nucleus chromatin organization of transcriptionally active and inactive nuclei were indistinguishable , both between TADs and inside a TAD . Therefore , chromatin organization is not predictive for the transcriptional state at the single - nucleus level . Finally , the spatial separation of genomic regions from two neighboring TADs was similar for active and inactive nuclei , indicating that physical encapsulation of gene regulatory elements may not be a strict necessity for the spatio - temporal control of transcription during early Drosophila embryogenesis . Results Quantification of single - nucleus chromosome organization heterogeneity during early Drosophila embryogenesis After fertilization , the fruit fly embryo undergoes thirteen rapid and synchronous nuclear division cycles ( nc1 to nc14 ) . During these cycles , nuclei continuously decrease their volumes due to the increase in the number of nuclei and to their migration to a reduced region close to the periphery of the embryo 46 . Transcription by the zygote is initiated in two waves : the minor wave between nc9 - nc13 , and the major wave at nc14 47 – 49 . This last stage coincides with the emergence of ensemble TADs 23 . Thus , early Drosophila embryonic development represents an ideal model system to investigate whether heterogeneity in chromosome organization changes with nuclear condensation , with the onset of transcription , and / or with the emergence of TADs . To address this question , we monitored changes in 3D chromatin organization at the TAD scale between nc11 and nc14 using HiM , a single nucleus multiplexed imaging method that allows for the single nucleus reconstruction of chromatin architecture in whole - mount embryos ( Fig . 1a ) 37 , 50 . We applied Hi - M to a locus displaying two TADs ( TAD1 and doc - TAD ) ( Fig . 1b ) annotated using Hi - C data 23 . The doc - TAD contains three developmental genes ( doc1 , doc2 , and doc3 ) 51 that are specifically activated at nc14 in the dorsal ectoderm 29 ( Fig . 1b ) . Nuclei and barcodes were segmented , localized , and drift - corrected as indicated previously ( Figs . S1a - b , 29 , 50 ) , and ensemble Hi - M pairwise distance ( ePWD ) maps for embryos at nc11 / 12 and nc14 were constructed by kernel density estimation of the full pairwise distance distributions ( Figs . 1b , and S1c - d , Methods ) . The most notable difference between nc11 / 12 and nc14 resided in an overall increase in distances between TAD1 and doc - TAD barcodes ( Fig . 1c , pink box ) , and an overall TAD condensation ( Fig . S1e , and Fig . 1c , yellow box ) . These results are consistent with the emergence of ensemble TAD at nc14 23 , but do not shed light into the possible changes in structural heterogeneity between nuclear cycles . To characterize variability in chromatin organization during early Drosophila development , we estimated the similarity in 3D conformation between different single nuclei . For this , we calculated the correlation between PWD maps of single - nuclei ( snPWD ) following the method of Conte et al . 41 . We performed this analysis for embryos at nc11 / 12 and at nc14 , before and after the emergence of ensemble TADs . Notably , the PWD maps of individual nuclei displayed a large degree of heterogeneity , with few nuclei exhibiting a PWD map similar to that of the ensemble ( Figs . 1d - e , top panels ) . For both developmental stages , the distribution of pair correlations were broad and centered around zero , indicating that the chromatin conformations of most nuclei were different from each other . Nevertheless , the distribution was skewed towards positive values , indicating that a small proportion of nuclei displayed similar chromatin conformations ( Figs . 1d - e , black line indicates median of the distribution ) . The overall lack of similarity between individual nuclei was observed before and after ensemble TADs emerged ( nc11 / 12 versus nc14 , Figs . 1d - e ) . We note that the lack of similarity between single - nuclei and ePWD maps is perhaps not surprising , as the average of a multi - parametric , widespread distribution tends not to represent any single individual 52 . Overall , these analyses indicate that chromosome structure heterogeneity is not only present in cultured cells 35 , 36 , 39 but is also common during early Drosophila development , despite the presence of robust mechanisms to control and coordinate gene expression and to synchronize the cell cycle of different nuclei . Presence of an ensemble TAD border partially segregates the conformational space explored by single nuclei Our previous analyses indicate that nc14 and nc11 / 12 nuclei display distinct ensemble average conformations despite their highly heterogeneous chromatin organizations ( Figs . 1c - e ) . However , these analyses do not reveal the extent to which the conformational spaces explored by single nc14 and nc11 / 12 nuclei overlap ( Fig . 1f ) : this quantification is needed to estimate whether and how single nuclei structures evolve during development . Thus , we turned to analysis techniques that do not rely on averages but rather on exploring chromatin conformations of single nuclei . The total number of independent dimensions needed to describe the accessible chromatin conformational space can be estimated by the number of degrees of freedom . Even for a small number of barcodes ( 20 ) , this results in a 54 - dimensional space which is inaccessible using conventional plotting methods . Thus , we turned to Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ( UMAP ) , an unsupervised , nonlinear dimension - reduction approach previously used to represent single - cell chromatin conformations 53 . In our implementation , we used UMAP to embed snPWD maps in a 2D space ( Methods ) . To validate our approach , we applied it to published single - cell data from cultured human cancer cells ( HCT116 ) 38 . Untreated cells displayed two clearly visible TADs that faded considerably in cohesin - depleted cells ( Fig . 1g , right panels ) . The UMAP embedding of single - cell PWD maps showed two clearly - separated populations highlighted by orange and cyan contours ( Fig . 1g , left panel ) , delimiting a smaller region where single cells were mixed . We note that a small number of untreated single cells ( ~ 3 % ) localize to the region occupied by cohesin - depleted cells , and vice versa . We observed similar segregation patterns for subsets containing 20 barcodes spanning either a strong or a weak TAD border ( Fig . S1f ) . Thus , UMAP embedding of snPWD maps shows that removal of TAD borders by cohesin depletion dramatically changes the chromatin structure of most single cells at this locus . To study whether this change also occurred during the natural emergence of TADs during embryonic development , we applied UMAP embedding to snPWD maps at nc11 / 12 and nc14 . Remarkably , we observed that most single nuclei segregated into two distinct populations corresponding to the different nuclear cycles ( Fig . 1h ) . As for human cultured cells , single nuclei occupied extended regions of the UMAP ( Figs . 1g - h ) , consistent with a large degree of heterogeneity in chromosome structure ( Figs . 1d - e ) . Segregation of single - nuclei in two populations was not sensitive to variations of the UMAP hyperparameters ( Fig . S1g ) . Therefore , we conclude that despite a large degree of heterogeneity , the chromatin structures of single nuclei change considerably during the early cycles of Drosophila embryogenesis and occupy distinct conformational spaces . TAD condensation is not critical to distinguish between single nuclei conformations Next , we implemented several analyses to investigate the factors influencing the segregation of single nuclei within the UMAP conformational space . First , we constructed average PWD matrices for a selection of single nuclei located at the four cardinal directions of the UMAP ( west , east , south , north ) ( Fig . 2a ) . Matrices from west and east nuclei were similar to the ePWD map ( Fig . 1b ) . Instead , south and north maps displayed more marked , complementary differences that can be mapped to the relative positions of nc11 / 12 and nc14 nuclei within the UMAP space ( Fig . 1h ) , and that mirrors the difference between nc11 / 12 and nc14 ensemble PWD maps ( Fig . 1c ) . We conclude that in this representation the second UMAP dimension encodes the most important differences between the structures of nc11 / 12 and nc14 nuclei . Second , we explored the role of TAD condensation by measuring the radius of gyration ( R g ) of the two TADs in single nuclei as a proxy for TAD volume . Adjacent TAD volumes were highly heterogeneous and uncorrelated ( Pearson coefficient ~ 0 . 1 ) , but decreased from nc11 / 12 to nc14 ( Fig . 2b ) . This latter observation raises the possibility that changes in TAD volumes may contribute to the segregation of the two distinct UMAP populations . To explore this hypothesis , we color - coded each nucleus in the UMAP by the radius of gyration of the doc - TAD ( Fig . 2c ) . Volumes in nuclei within the nc14 population tended to exhibit smaller volumes ( R g < 0 . 27μm ) , while the opposite was observed in the nc11 / 12 population ( R g > 0 . 27μm ) . However , nuclei in both regions displayed extended and compact TAD volumes and no clear trend of the radius of gyration along either UMAP dimension was discernible . Thus , TAD volume contributes but is not the only factor separating single nuclei within the UMAP space . Single nuclei displaying insulated TADs are common before the emergence of ensemble TADs . Next , we investigated the role of TAD insulation in the segregation of single nuclei conformations . For this , we first calculated the ensemble and single nuclei insulation scores ( IS ) of nc14 nuclei ( Fig . 2d , top panel ) following the method developed by Crane et al . 54 . Low insulation scores represent regions with strong borders ( see Methods ) . As expected , the median IS profile for nc14 nuclei showed a dip at the barcode located at the border between TAD1 and doc - TAD ( hereafter border barcode ) . The corresponding dip in the median IS profile for nc11 / 12 was instead less pronounced ( Fig . 2e , top panel ) , consistent with the emergence of the ensemble TAD border at nc14 in this locus ( Figs . 1b - c ) . We explored the variability of this border by stacking the single - nuclei IS profiles , sorted by their IS score at the border barcode ( Fig . 2d , e , bottom panels ) . We quantified the proportion of nuclei displaying a strong insulation between TADs by using a single - nucleus IS cutoff of 3 . 5 . Notably , at nc14 only a small proportion of single nuclei ( ~ 14 % with IS < 3 . 5 ) displayed insulation at the border barcode ( i . e . , the ensemble TAD border ) , while many nuclei exhibited low insulation scores at other genomic locations . Similar results were obtained for other IS cutoffs ( Fig . S2a ) . Thus , we conclude that for nc14 embryos the border barcode is not always insulated but rather represents the region displaying the most preferred insulation , consistent with results in human cultured cells 38 . As ensemble TADs emerge at nc14 , we wondered whether and to what extent single nuclei in previous nuclear cycles were already insulated at the border barcode . As expected , the ensemble IS at the border barcode was higher in nc11 / 12 than in nc14 nuclei ( Fig . 2e , top panel ) . However , we were surprised by the frequency of single nc11 / 12 nuclei displaying insulation at the border barcode . This frequency was smaller ( 10 % with IS < 3 . 5 ) , yet comparable to that observed in nc14 embryos , indicating that single nuclei displaying insulated TADs also exist in early developmental cycles before the emergence of ensemble TADs . Notably , TAD condensation does not seem to define the level of TAD insulation , as insulation scores and TAD volumes were uncorrelated both in nc11 / 12 and nc14 embryos ( Fig . 2f , S2b ) . Finally , we explored whether the presence of a TAD border was sufficient to split cells between UMAP populations by color - coding each single nuclei in the UMAP by the insulation score at the border barcode ( Figs . 2g and S2c ) . We observed a wide distribution of insulation scores for both UMAP populations and no strong correlation with any of the UMAP dimensions . We observed a similar broad distribution of insulation scores for human HCT116 cells ( Fig . S2c ) . Remarkably , nuclei with high insulation scores ( i . e . low insulation ) were common within the nc14 UMAP population ( Fig . 1g ) . Similarly , single cells with high IS were common in untreated human HCT116 cells ( Fig . S2c ) . Importantly , single nuclei in nc11 / 12 commonly displayed low IS values ( i . e . high insulation ) , an observation that is mirrored by cohesin depleted HCT116 single cells ( Fig . S2c ) . In summary , only a minority of nuclei exhibit a strong border between TAD1 and doc - TAD in nc14 embryos , and this population of insulated TAD is already present at earlier stages of development that do not display discernable ensemble TADs . Transcriptionally active and inactive nuclei explore similar regions of the UMAP space Naturally , we wondered whether transcription contributed to the single - nucleus organization of chromatin at the doc locus . To address this question , we imaged DNA organization by Hi - M together with the detection of doc1 expressing nuclei by RNA - FISH in the same embryos ( Fig . 3a ) . The presence of doc1 nuclear transcription hotspots was used to label each single nuclei in the embryo as doc1 active or inactive ( Fig . 3a ) . In a first attempt to correlate TAD organization and transcription , we calculated the median intra - and inter - TAD distances for individual active and inactive nuclei . As expected , intra - TAD distances were smaller than inter - TAD distances ( Fig . 3b , Methods ) . Interestingly , both intra - and inter - TAD distances were higher for transcriptionally active nuclei . Similar trends were observed for the difference PWD map and for the distribution of doc - TAD volumes in active and inactive nuclei ( Figs . S3a - b ) . Overall , these results indicate that the doc - TAD was −on average− slightly more decondensed and more segregated from TAD1 in actively transcribing nuclei than in inactive nuclei . To determine whether this trend was also visible in single nuclei , we calculated the radius of gyration of the doc TAD in each single nucleus and displayed it along the doc1 activation pattern ( Fig . 3c ) . We observed that the volume of the doc TAD did not strongly correlate with the transcriptional status of single nuclei . Notably , nuclei with large and small TAD volumes were observed both in the active and inactive patterns ( Fig . 3c , bottom panels ) . Thus , TAD volume seems to only poorly distinguish between single nuclei with different transcriptional states . Different chromatin structures within TADs may give rise to similar TAD volumes , thus we turned to UMAP embedding to further explore the possible role of transcription in the 3D chromatin structure of single nuclei . For this , we embedded single nc11 / 12 and nc14 nuclei together , and color coded them according to their transcriptional status ( Fig . 3d ) . Doc1 is expressed at nc14 , thus most active cells appeared within the region of the UMAP enriched in nc14 nuclei ( Fig . 3d , cyan shape ) . Remarkably , active and inactive cells were homogeneously distributed across this region , consistent with transcription not playing a key role in determining the overall 3D conformation of single nuclei . The genomic coverage of the oligopaint library used in these experiments was sufficient to visualize TADs in this locus , but not to detect specific regulatory interactions within the doc - TAD ( Fig . 3d ) . Thus , we performed a similar analysis using a published dataset with a genomic coverage that enabled the detection of cis - regulatory interactions ( Fig . S3c ) 29 . Nc11 / 12 and nc14 cells occupied different regions of the UMAP embedding ( Fig . 3e ) , consistent with the results obtained with the lower coverage oligopaint library ( Fig . 1h ) . In addition , doc1 active and inactive nuclei also intermingled within the nc14 pattern and did not segregate from each other . Consistent with these findings , TAD volumes were similar for active and inactive nuclei for the higher resolution library ( Fig . S3d ) . All in all , these results suggest that the chromatin organization of active and inactive nuclei are indistinguishable at the ensemble and single nucleus levels . Single nucleus TAD insulation and intermingling are independent of transcriptional activity Several lines of evidence suggest that TAD borders play a role in insulating enhancer - promoter interactions between neighboring TADs , however this role is currently under intense debate 15 . Thus , we wondered whether insulation at the single cell level affected the expression of doc1 . For this , we plotted the single nucleus IS profiles ranked by IS at the border barcode together with transcriptional status ( Fig . 4a ) . Notably , we did not observe a correlation between the transcriptional state of single nuclei and their insulation score ( Fig . 4a ) . In fact , both active and inactive nuclei displayed low insulation scores ( i . e . strong TAD border ) , and conversely in many active nuclei we failed to observe a clear single - nucleus boundary at the border barcode . These conclusions are supported by the ensemble IS profiles for active and inactive cells ( Fig . 4b ) which show that active cells are similarly insulated than inactive cells . To test whether proximity of TAD1 enhancers to the doc1 promoter influenced its transcription , we calculated the intermingling between TADs for active and inactive cells . TAD interminging was estimated by the demixing score , calculated by measuring the ratio between intra - to inter - TAD distances ( see Methods ) . Notably , the distributions of demixing scores were very similar for both states of transcription ( Fig . 4c ) . This result is inconsistent with physical proximity between TAD1 enhancers and the doc1 promoter playing an important role in its transcriptional activation . As PWD distributions are broad , changes in short - range distances , i . e . , a contact between loci , might be overlooked when only considering distances 55 . Therefore , we binarized the single nucleus PWD maps using a contact threshold of 0 . 25 µm and tested whether the transcriptional state of single nuclei was linked to a change in the number of contacts between the two TADs ( Fig . 4d ) . In fact , the distributions in the number of inter - TAD contacts were very similar for active and inactive nuclei , supporting the conclusions from our previous analysis using demixing scores . All in all , these analyses show that at this locus TADs are insulated in a small proportion of nuclei , that insulation is not correlated with transcriptional activation at the single nucleus level , and that TAD intermingling is as common in active as in inactive nuclei . Thus , we conclude that transcription does not seem to play a key role in the structure of single nuclei as measured by TAD insulation and intermingling . Discussion Population - average TADs require the presence of CTCF and cohesin in mammals 38 , 56 – 58 , and can first be detected at the zygotic genome activation step in multiple species 23 , 24 , 59 – 61 . In this study , we used an imaging - based method that simultaneously provides developmental timing , transcriptional status , and snapshots of chromatin conformations in single nuclei during this developmental transition . This imaging method , combined with state - of - the - art single - cell analysis techniques , provides new insights into the roles that TAD insulation , TAD condensation and transcription play in shaping chromatin structure . Chromatin organization at the TAD scale was previously shown to be highly variable both by FISH 35 , 36 , 38 , 39 , and by polymer modeling simulations 5 , 40 , 41 , 62 . These models showed that chromatin forms globular TAD - like structures in the presence of attractive interactions between monomers in a TAD 40 , or in the presence of loop extrusion by cohesin 63 , 64 . In contrast , chromatin behaves as a random - coil polymer in the absence of cohesin or in absence of monomer - monomer interactions 40 , 63 , 64 . Notably , our results show that chromatin is similarly heterogeneous in presence or absence of ensemble TADs , suggesting that intra - TAD interactions do not play a major role in constraining the degree of variability of chromatin conformations . A reasonable explanation for this behavior , compatible with simulation and imaging data 35 , 36 , 40 , is that intra - TAD interactions are transient and highly variable between cells , likely reflecting the binding dynamics of transcription factors and architectural proteins 65 – 68 and their cell - to - cell heterogeneity , as well as chromatin conformational dynamics . Notably , despite this heterogeneity , the chromatin conformations of single nuclei before and after the emergence of ensemble TADs were distinct enough to occupy different regions in the 2D UMAP embedding of the conformational hyperspace . We observed similar results in datasets from untreated and cohesin - depleted human cells . Thus , tracing the path of chromatin in a single nucleus at the TAD - scale and with relatively sparse sampling ( 20 - 50 barcodes ) is sufficient to predict , with reasonable confidence , the presence of mechanisms leading to TAD formation . We insist , however , on the probabilistic nature of this prediction , given that ( 1 ) single nuclei conformations may fall , with low probability , into regions of the UMAP space displaying overlapping conformations ; and ( 2 ) the regions of the UMAP space attributed to each population are not unequivocal . These results suggested that structural parameters , such as TAD insulation or condensation , or transcriptional activity may be the main factors segregating single nuclei in the UMAP space . Surprisingly , this does not appear to be the case , as none of these factors played predominant roles in the segregation of single conformations in the UMAP space . For instance , while TADs tended to be more condensed in nc14 embryos , an important proportion of nc11 / 12 embryos also exhibited TADs condensed to similar levels . Surprisingly , only a fraction of nuclei displayed strong insulation between TAD1 and the doc - TAD in nc14 embryos , and a smaller but significant fraction of nuclei exhibited strong insulation in nc11 / 12 embryos . These results are consistent with Hi - C and imaging studies where TAD borders in Drosophila were shown to be variable between single nuclei 31 , 35 . In Drosophila , TAD boundaries are mainly occupied by architectural factors 13 , 14 , and their appearance requires binding of pioneering factors 23 . In this context , our results suggest that occupation of TAD borders : ( 1 ) is stochastic , possibly due to the binding kinetics of architectural proteins and of components of the transcriptional machinery ; ( 2 ) gradually increases during early development as these factors become more abundant . All in all , our results suggest that neither TAD condensation , nor TAD insulation can be used to predict whether a nucleus belongs to nc14 or nc11 / 12 embryos . We conclude that , instead of a single structural parameter , multiple combinatorial contributions from several structural properties may be required to assign single chromatin conformations to specific developmental stages with high confidence . This is consistent with a recent study showing that multiple , spatially - distributed structural features are required to predict transcriptional activation in the BX - C domain during late Drosophila embryogenesis 69 . Cell - to - cell variations in the gene activation of genes within a TAD , either arising from controlled variations in transcriptional programs between cell - types or from stochasticity in transcription 70 , could arguably contribute to the spatial distribution of single conformations within the UMAP space . Consistent with this idea and with previous evidence 35 , 42 active nuclei showed on average a slightly more decondensed chromatin architecture than inactive nuclei . However , despite these small differences , transcriptionally active and inactive nuclei explored overlapping conformational spaces and did not segregate from each other in the UMAP space . These results are consistent with recent studies showing that , during Drosophila development , the population - averaged chromatin architectures of cells from different presumptive tissues display only overall small differences 28 , 29 . Thus , we conclude that transcription does not seem to play a dominant role in determining the chromatin structure of single nuclei at least during these early stages of Drosophila development . The single nucleus snapshots of chromatin architecture occupied preferential regions in the UMAP space that depended on the developmental stage . How much of this conformational space can be explored by an individual nucleus during a biologically relevant time - scale , i . e . , one cell cycle ? The succession of nuclear division cycles is fast during early development of Drosophila , with cell cycles lasting 10 - 12 minutes for nc11 and nc12 and at least 65 minutes for nc14 71 . Existing experimental approaches that dynamically track genomic loci 19 , 21 , 72 are currently not able to address the question of TAD - scale chromatin mobility directly as technological limitations in live - cell labeling so far have prevented dynamic visualization of more than two loci at the same time . Future studies that simultaneously track more than two genomic regions in vivo at high genomic ( < 10kb ) and optical ( < 150nm ) resolutions will be needed to determine whether chromatin within TADs dynamically explore their conformational space during interphase . Nevertheless , polymer physics predicts that a spatial neighborhood of 150 - 300nm ( roughly corresponding to a genomic region of 100kb ) can be extensively explored by a locus in 2 - 5 minutes 73 , 74 . This suggests that , despite short cell cycle times during early Drosophila development , a genomic region spanning a few TADs ( as that investigated here ) should be able to cover a substantial part of the conformational space outlined by single nucleus snapshots , leading to ergodicity at these short spatial scales . Studies in mammalian cells have shown a non - zero probability for TAD - like domain boundaries at any locus 38 and a heterogeneity in the intermingling of two regions that are separated by a TAD border in the ensemble - average 43 , 44 . Our model system enabled the investigation of single nucleus variation in TAD insulation in intact embryos , where development progresses in a highly synchronous and orchestrated fashion in contrast to cell cultures . Thus , we expected the contribution of external sources of perturbation ( e . g . differences in cell cycle stage or transcriptional activation within well - defined presumptive tissues ) to be reduced . Nevertheless , we still observed that insulation between adjacent TADs is highly heterogeneous at the single nucleus level . Additionally , we found that intermingling of the doc - TAD with the upstream TAD is independent of doc1 activation . This lack of a strong insulation effect suggests that tissue - and time - specific enhancers carrying the right composition of transcription - activating factors , together with promoters bound by compatible sets of factors , are the main regulators of gene expression in this system . In this scenario , other nearby enhancers would only play a minor role , due to lack of compatible activating factors , even when they could be in spatial proximity to the promoter . Alternatively or in addition , a carefully - balanced non - linear relationship between enhancer - promoter contact frequency and transcriptional output could also explain the similar single nucleus insulation profile of active and inactive nuclei . Such non - linear models have been proposed by several groups recently 75 – 77 . These non - linear models have in common that gene activation is modeled as a multi - step process that makes repeated interactions between enhancer and promoter necessary before gene activation is achieved . Thus , EP contacts spanning a population - average TAD border could occur , but with a frequency that is not sufficient to effectively trigger transcription . In the case of the doc genes , multiple enhancer elements ( validated or putative ) are distributed throughout the doc - TAD 29 . As the number of enhancers vastly outnumbers the number of genes 78 , regulation of a gene by multiple enhancers seems to be the rule , not the exception . The classical gene regulation model assumes that stable , long - lasting EP contacts need to be formed , thus restricting the possibility for alternative chromatin configurations . By contrast , a highly flexible chromatin organization could be an advantage , as different enhancers could physically access the promoter region , thereby offering a way to ensure phenotypic robustness as discussed for mammalian organisms 79 . This robustness would be especially important during early development when cells need to follow precise spatiotemporally gene - expression programs . It is interesting to note that a recent deep - learning analysis of chromatin tracing data suggest that chromatin structures linked to the transcriptional state of a gene are broadly distributed across the gene’s regulatory domain and that individual enhancer - promoter interactions don ' t play a major role in defining the transcriptional activity of a gene 69 . Overall , our analysis of single - nucleus microscopy - based chromosome conformation capture data is compatible with a model of flexible chromatin organization that serves as a scaffold with enhancer - bound transcription - activating factors encoding the logic that integrates multiple , potentially short - lived , interactions that can extend beyond domain borders defined from ensemble - averaged experiments .

RNA - FISH and hybridization of the primary Hi - M library The in situ hybridization protocol for RNA detection of doc1 and the protocol for hybridization of the primary Hi - M library are described elsewhere 29 , 50 . Acquisition of Hi - M datasets Experiments were performed on a homemade , wide - field epifluorescence microscope described previously 29 . Protocols for attachment of embryos to the coverslip and for the sequential labeling and imaging were also previously reported 29 . Image processing The acquired dataset consisted of image stacks with 2048x2048 pixels and 60 slices ( voxel size 0 . 106x0 . 106x0 . 250 µm 3 ) . Raw images supplied by the camera were in DCIMG format and were converted to TIFF using proprietary software from Hamamatsu . The TIFF images were then deconvolved using Huygens Professional v . 20 . 04 ( Scientific Volume Imaging , https : / / svi . nl ) . Further analysis was done using a homemade software pipeline written in python 29 . First , images were z - projected using sum ( DAPI channel ) or maximum intensity ( barcodes , fiducials ) projection . Then , for each hybridization round , the image of the fiducial channel was aligned to the reference fiducial image in a two - step process : 1 ) Global alignment by cross - correlation of the two images split in 8x8 non - overlapping blocks and averaging over the translation offset of all 64 blocks . 2 ) Local alignment in 3D of volumes each containing a single nucleus by cross - correlation . Barcodes were segmented using a neural network ( stardist ) 80 specifically trained for the detection of 3D diffraction limited spots produced by our microscope . To extract the position of the barcode with sub - pixel accuracy , a subsequent 3D Gaussian fit of the regions segmented by stardist was performed with Big - FISH ( https : / / github . com / fish - quant / big - fish , 81 ) . Barcode localizations with intensities lower than 1 . 5 times that of the background were filtered out . Nuclei were segmented from projected DAPI images using stardist 80 with a neural network trained for detection of nuclei from Drosophila embryos under our imaging conditions . Barcodes were then attributed to single nuclei by using the XY coordinates of the barcodes and the DAPI masks of the nuclei . Finally , pairwise distance matrices were calculated for each single nucleus . The transcriptional state of the nuclei was attributed by manually drawing polygons over the nuclei displaying a pattern of active transcription . Ensemble - average pairwise distance map The ensemble pairwise distance map was calculated from the first maximum of the kernel density estimation for each pairwise distance distribution ( Gaussian kernel , bandwidth 0 . 25 pixel , excluding pairwise distances larger than 4 . 0 µm ) , which is a robust approximation for the mode of the pairwise distance distribution . In case of the human HCT116 cell line data 38 , the median of the pairwise distance distribution was used to calculate the ensemble pairwise distance map , following the approach of the original paper . Radius of gyration The radius of gyration was calculated from the pairwise distances using , where is the pairwise distance between barcode i and j . The number of 𝑅 𝑔 2 = 1 2𝑁 2 𝑖 , 𝑗 ∑ ( 𝑑 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) 2 𝑑 𝑖 , 𝑗 pairwise distances ( N 2 ) is adjusted in case a pairwise distance was not detected for a given cell . Pairwise distances above a threshold ( 1 . 0 µm ) were set to NaN to remove outliers that would bias the radius of gyration towards large values . Cells with less than one third of all pairwise distances detected were excluded from analysis . Calculation of the radius of gyration is based on the standard - resolution Hi - M library except for Fig . 3c , which uses the high - resolution Hi - M data as a slightly higher fraction of nuclei could be used to calculate the radius of gyration for this data . Pair correlation The similarity of the chromatin organization between single nuclei was calculated by the pair correlation for all possible pairs of nuclei , following 41 . In more detail , nuclei with a detection of less than 13 out of 20 barcodes ( low - resolution library ) or 11 out of 17 barcodes ( high - resolution library ) were excluded from analysis . The upper triangle of the sn pairwise distance maps was flattened to yield a vectorized representation . The Pearson correlation coefficient for all pairs of vectorized distance maps was calculated , using the reciprocal distance to be more sensitive to changes in small distances . Pairwise distances that were not detected in both corresponding nuclei were masked for the calculation of the correlation coefficient . A given pair of nuclei was skipped when the number of the overlapping detected pairwise distances is smaller than half of the full number of pairwise distances . As a reference , the pair correlation of randomly shuffled pairwise distance maps was calculated . For this , for each pair one of the pairwise distance maps was reordered randomly ten times and the Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated as described above for each of the ten randomizations . UMAP embedding The number of nuclei for different developmental time points ( nc11 / 12 vs nc14 ) or different treatment ( wt vs auxin treated ) were roughly matched by adjusting the cutoff for excluding nuclei from analysis based on the number of detected barcodes . For the low - resolution library , nuclei were excluded when more than 7 , or 6 , out of 20 barcodes were not detected ( nc11 / 12 , or nc14 , respectively ) . For the high - resolution library , nuclei were excluded when more than 5 , or 2 , out of 17 barcodes were not detected ( nc11 / 12 , or nc14 , respectively ) . For the human HCT116 cell line data , nuclei were excluded when more than 5 , or 1 , out of 83 barcodes were not detected ( auxin - treated , or wt , respectively ) . For the remaining nuclei , single nucleus pairwise distances not detected were imputed with the corresponding value from the ensemble pairwise distance map . Then , the single nucleus pairwise distance maps were vectorized ( see “pair correlation” above ) and the different categories ( developmental time points or treatments ) were concatenated . Dimension reduction to two dimensions was achieved by unsupervised embedding , using the python implementation of “Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection” ( UMAP ) 82 . Parameters were : n _ neighbors = 50 , min _ dist = 0 . 1 , n _ epochs = 500 , metric = " canberra " . Insulation score If indicated , the same selection of nuclei and imputation of missing sn pairwise distances as for the UMAP embedding was performed . Otherwise the raw data was used . To calculate the sn insulation score , we followed an approach similar to the one used for bulk Hi - C contact maps 54 . In short , a square of 2 - by - 2 barcodes is moved parallel to the diagonal of the pairwise distance map and the inverse of the pairwise distances in this square are summed . This yields a profile of the insulation score per nucleus with lower insulation score values corresponding to a higher insulation . Intra - and inter - TAD distances and demixing score To get average intra - and inter - TAD distances for each nucleus , the median of all pairwise distances in the doc - TAD or between TAD 1 and doc - TAD were calculated . Distances above a threshold ( 1 . 0 µm ) were excluded and medians were calculated only when at least 3 intra - or inter - TAD distances were detected for a nucleus . The demixing score is calculated per nucleus as the log2 ratio of the median intra - and inter - TAD distances . Inter - TAD contacts and 3 - way interactions Two barcodes were considered in contact when their distance was less than 250 nm . The number of inter - TAD contacts per nucleus was obtained by counting the number of contacts in the inter - TAD region in the contact map . We calculated the 3 - way contact probability as the number of barcode pairs within 250 nm to any third barcode , normalized by the number of nuclei containing all three barcodes . This approach thus highlights barcode pairs that are frequently involved in 3 - way interactions . Statistics The p - values in Fig . 3b , 4c , and S1e were calculated by a two - sided Welch ' s t - test . Figure Legends Figure 1 .
