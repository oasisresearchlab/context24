The selection of components during virus assembly must therefore be ﬂexible enough to allow the incorporation of unrelated viral membrane proteins , yet speciﬁc enough to exclude the bulk of host proteins . This apparent contradiction has been termed the pseudotypic paradox . There is mounting evidence that lipid rafts play a role in the assembly pathway of non - icosahedral , enveloped viruses . Viral components are concentrated initially in localized regions of the plasma membrane via their interaction with lipid raft domains . Lateral interactions of viral structural proteins amplify the changes in local lipid composition which in turn enhance the concentration of viral proteins in the rafts . An afﬁnity for lipid rafts may be the common feature of enveloped virus proteins that leads to the formation of pseudotypes . INTRODUCTION ‘It’s lovely to live on a raft . ’ – Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , Samuel Clemens . Physicists and structural biologists have long been attracted by the precision and order of virus assembly . Some believe that the process is similar to the crystallization of isolated proteins . The cell , however , is a more complex and struc - tured environment than a crystallization tray . Viruses , the most exploitative and resourceful of cellular parasites , take advantage of this organization to optimize their life cycles . The process is therefore not so appealingly simple and consideration of the cellular environment is essential to an understanding of virus assembly . Pseudotype formation is a feature of virus assembly that is only comprehensible in the context of a structured cell . Membrane viruses normally assemble their own spikes and internal proteins . However , during a mixed infection of a host cell with two different enveloped viruses , particles may be produced that contain the genome of one virus packaged within a membrane that contains the envelope proteins of the other , or both viruses . These are pseudotypes . This phenomenon was described ﬁrst with RNA viruses but examples were soon found in DNA viruses ( Huang et al . , 1974 ; Lee et al . , 2001 ; Pastorekova et al . , 1992 ; Witte & Baltimore , 1977 ) . The consequences of sharing envelope proteins include an increased breadth in the virus host range . A virus infection that would normally be restricted to certain cells can be mediated in other cells through the envelope proteins of the co - infecting virus . This behaviour is essential to the infectivity of replication - defective acute transforming retroviruses , which lack envelope glycopro - teins and therefore require the presence of a co - infecting helper virus ( Granger & Fan , 2001 ) . It may also be desirable for the production of vectors for gene therapy ( Kang et al . , 2002 ; VandenDriessche et al . , 2002 ) . The largest numbers of examples of pseudotyping were reported for vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) ( Za´vada , 1972a , b ; Za´vada et al . , 1972 , 1978 , 1979 , 1983 ; Za´vada & Rosenbergova , 1972 ; Zavadova & Za´vada , 1980 ) and other matrix ( M ) protein - containing viruses ( Za´vada , 1976 ) ; this may simply reﬂect the fact that tools for assaying for pseudotypes were well developed in these systems ( Za´vada , 1977 ) . In contrast to the plasticity of surface component incorporation , attempts to demonstrate mixing of internal components between unrelated envelope viruses failed ( McSharry et al . , 1971 ) . An insightful review by Za´vada ( 1982 ) summarized the breadth of examples and emphasized the paradoxical nature of the phenomenon . As described by Za´vada ( 1982 ) , this ‘pseudo - typic paradox’ arose from the combination of three observations : ‘ ( 1 ) enveloped viruses non - selectively incor - porate both their own glycoprotein ( gp ) as well as the gp of viruses belonging to other families ; ( 2 ) cell membranes assemble both cellular and virus surface gp ; and ( 3 ) enveloped viruses seem to exclude cellular gp from mature virions . ’ The ability of membrane viruses to accommodate the proteins of an unrelated virus , while excluding most cellular proteins , suggested a sophisticated mechanism for recogniz - ing viral proteins in preference to cellular ones . ‘The only Published ahead of print on 15 January 2003 as DOI 10 . 1099 / vir . 0 . 18779 - 0 . 0001 - 8779 G 2003 SGM Printed in Great Britain 757 Journal of General Virology ( 2003 ) , 84 , 757 – 768 DOI 10 . 1099 / vir . 0 . 18779 - 0 Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 21 Jun 2019 03 : 20 : 08 explanation that occurs to us is that the enveloped viruses must share a common , highly speciﬁc mechanism of assembly of virus surface structures’ ( Za´vada , 1982 ) . The identiﬁcation of these common features , including perhaps the protein motifs responsible , represented a formidable challenge . One of the models put forward by the review appears prescient in predicting that ‘some alteration in the ultrastructure of the lipid membrane is induced by attachment of virus M protein or its equivalent and that this alteration must be the same in all enveloped viruses . It is our guess that this might function by phase partitioning’ ( Za´vada , 1982 ) . This review will summarize research implicating lipid domains in the assembly pathways of a number of enveloped viruses and discuss how they provide a ready explanation for the phenomenon of pseudotyping ( Pickl et al . , 2001 ) . A suggestive image How might membrane domains feature in the assembly of enveloped viruses ? Cryo - electron micrographs ( Fig . 1 ) of a preparation of feline foamy virus ( FFV ) grown in Crandel feline kidney ( CrFK ) cells show that it contains two mor - phologically distinct viruses : FFV ( Fischer et al . , 1998 ; Wilk et al . , 2000 , 2001b ; Winkler et al . , 1997 ; Yu et al . , 1996 ; Zemba et al . , 1998 ) and feline leukaemia virus ( FLV ) ( Bolognesi , 1974 ; Essex et al . , 1973 ; Gallo & Wong - Staal , 1982 ) . These are seen as individual particles in Fig . 1 ( A ) . The FFV particle ( black annotation ) displays the double - layered angular core structure ( hexagon , small arrowheads ) , clear membrane leaﬂets ( arrows ) and prominent rod - shaped spikes ( ~ 130 A˚ long , large arrowhead ) that characterize FFV in cryo - electron microscopy ( Wilk et al . , 2000 , 2001a ) . The FLV particle is annotated in white . The morphology of this particle is quite distinct from that of FFV . The FLV core is round rather than angular and displays a radial arrangement of rod - like features ( small arrows ) character - istic of Gag in other retroviruses ( Fuller et al . , 1997 ; Wilk et al . , 1999 , 2001b ) . The membrane lacks prominent surface spikes and appears broader ( large arrow ) due to the presence of a submembrane protein layer . The morphological differences between these two viruses make it possible to interpret the hybrid particle seen in Fig . 1 ( B ) . The simplest explanation is that separate assem - blies of FFV and FLV proteins have budded into the same envelope . Two distinct cores are seen within the single particle . Each core is associated with a portion of the envelope , which has a distinct local appearance . The rod - like FFV spikes are localized near the angular FFV core and away from the round core and broad membrane layer of FLV . Microscopists are notorious for their tendency to elaborate a complex biological framework from a single image ( Baker et al . , 1999 ; Wilk & Fuller , 1999 ) . We need to remain cautious in distinguishing the illustrative from the proba - tive . Nevertheless , this image of a hybrid particle suggests a particular view of retrovirus assembly in which interactions with membrane domains select both envelope and core proteins . Initially , lipid domains select viral membrane proteins by their afﬁnity for the domains . Viral proteins Fig . 1 .

This gathering of components is self - reinforcing so that the domains become stable entities as further components are recruited . In the FFV / FLV example , interactions with lipids localize the two viruses to the same domain within the membrane , while protein – protein interactions maintain the separate nature of the two virus assemblies . The hybrid particle could result from the budding of the adjacent assemblies into one particle . The co - localization and resulting incorporation of envelope proteins from co - infecting membrane viruses provides an explanation for the creation of pseudotypes . This hybrid particle would have the broadened host range of a pseudo - type , although the classical pseudotypic particle would contain the internal proteins of only one of the partners . Lipid rafts are the chief candidates for the domains that recruit the viral components . Enveloped virus assembly and sorting Virus assembly shares features with other macromolecular assembly processes in cells . Both processes incorporate mechanisms for regulation and control . Both require the bringing together of many components so that an ordered series of speciﬁc interactions leads to recognition and assembly . Often the components to be assembled are con - centrated and segregated from the other cellular compo - nents so that the appropriate interactions become more likely and can occur without interference . A further common feature is cooperation . Oligomerization is used to generate the template that is recognized in later steps of assembly . This enhances the effect of the individual recognition steps so that a weak preference for interaction between two com - ponents becomes ampliﬁed by cooperation among many . Enveloped virus formation exhibits the general features of this assembly process ( Simons & Fuller , 1985 ) as well as the distinctive characteristic of membrane assemblies : that the selection and incorporation of components occurs in a two - dimensional milieu . In this environment , an inappropriate component can be included more easily through being trapped in a growing two - dimensional array , even in the absence of a speciﬁc interaction . Consequently , assembly in two dimensions must use a hierarchy of sorting steps that allow selection of the correct components and exclusion of incorrect ones . Incorporating an inappropriate surface component could have signiﬁcant consequences for the biology of the virus . Enveloped viruses use their surface components for entry . Typically , the surface proteins function in receptor recognition and membrane fusion . We have already seen that incorporation of inappropriate components could allow interactions with a broader range of cell surface proteins and hence alter the speciﬁcity of entry . The effect on fusion could be equally dramatic . In the case of inﬂuenza virus , oligomerization of haemagglutinin ( HA ) is required to form the fusion pore ( Ellens et al . , 1990 ; Gutman et al . , 1993 ; White et al . , 1996 ) . A reduction in HA concentration , equivalent to an increase in the concentration of foreign proteins , leads to a large decrease in the efﬁciency of fusion ( Ellens et al . , 1990 ) . How effective is the sorting during virus formation and budding ? Budding from the plasma membrane occurs in an environment of ~ 30 000 plasma membrane proteins per square micron ( Grifﬁths et al . , 1984 ; Quinn et al . , 1984 ; Simons & Fuller , 1985 ) . The surface density of viral proteins in a budded virion is easiest to calculate for an icosahedral enveloped virus such as Semliki Forest virus ( SFV ) , which has ~ 25 000 spike complexes per square micron ( Fuller et al . , 1995 ; Mancini et al . , 2000 ; Simons & Fuller , 1985 ) . Hence , virus budding does not lead to a signiﬁcant change in the concentration of surface proteins within the budding particle but rather selection of the proteins from the mixed population at the cell surface . The selectivity is extreme . Even in a relatively late stage of infection , the viral proteins contribute only ~ 1 % of the surface proteins of the infected cell and yet the budded SFV virion does not contain detectible cellular proteins ( Fuller et al . , 1995 ; Mancini et al . , 2000 ; Simons & Fuller , 1985 ) . These considerations also apply to non - icosahedral viruses , such as retroviruses , where an even smaller fraction of the protein on the cell surface is contributed by the virus ( Vogt , 1997 ) . In such viruses , a subset of cellular plasma membrane proteins is also incorporated into virions , while others are excluded . Human immunodeﬁciency virus ( HIV ) , for example , incorporates more than 20 cellular proteins ( Esser et al . , 2001 ; Ott , 2002 ) . Some cellular proteins , such as cyclophilin A and HLA - II in HIV , may be included through speciﬁc interaction with viral proteins . As discussed below , others may simply be co - localized with viral proteins through raft association . Lipid rafts Cellular membranes contain hundreds of different lipid components , including glycerophospholipids , sphingolipids and cholesterol , each of which have different chemical , phy - sical and biological properties . Accumulating evidence suggests that sphingolipids and cholesterol can become segregated from other membrane lipids to form ordered lipid micro - domains , called rafts , ﬂoating in a glycerophospholipid - rich environment ( Cheong et al . , 1999 ; Harder et al . , 1998 ; Harder & Simons , 1997 ; Lafont & Simons , 2001 ; Lusa et al . , 2001 ; Rietveld et al . , 1999 ; Scheiffele et al . , 1999 ; Simons et al . , 2000 ; Verkade et al . , 2000 ) . Raft lipids are probably held together weakly , establishing a dynamic equilibrium of raft and non - raft regions within the plasma membrane ( Harder & Simons , 1997 ) . The sphingo - lipids interact laterally through van der Waals interactions and extensive hydrogen bonding between the sugar head groups and between the sphingosine backbones . Moreover , the majority of sphingolipids have saturated , and therefore unkinked , acyl chains that allow tighter packing of laterally http : / / vir . sgmjournals . org 759 Review : Lipid rafts and virus assembly Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 21 Jun 2019 03 : 20 : 08 associating lipids and a higher gel - to - liquid phase transition temperature ( Boggs & Wang , 2001 ) . These interactions lead to segregation of sphingolipid - rich domains from their glycerophospholipid - rich surroundings . The degree of lateral interaction is increased further by the presence of choles - terol . The 3 - b - hydroxyl group of cholesterol hydrogen bonds with the ceramide group of sphingolipids , while its planar sterol ring interacts with the saturated acyl chain . In this way cholesterol ﬁlls the voids between neighbouring sphingolipids ( Harder & Simons , 1997 ) and increases the local rigidity of the bilayer . The most common biochemical tool used for studying membrane rafts has been extraction with cold non - ionic detergents such as Triton X - 100 or NP - 40 ( Fig . 2 ) . This treatment results in the formation of detergent - resistant membranes ( DRMs ) , which are also referred to as detergent - insoluble glycolipid - enriched complexes or DIGs . DRMs exhibit a buoyant density which allows them to be separated from membranes and soluble proteins by ﬂotation in density gradients . Many cellular proteins are found to be associated with DRMs . The raft passengers The nature of the association between ‘raftophilic’ proteins and rafts varies . Only a few proteins are permanent residents . These are important for maintaining a speciﬁc raft organization and include the caveolins ( Galbiati et al . , 2001 ; Harder & Simons , 1997 ; Monier et al . , 1996 ) . Many other proteins , however , are transient passengers or guests , taking advantage of the remoteness of the lipid island for intracellular targeting ( Lusa et al . , 2001 ) or speciﬁc signal transduction processes ( Cheng et al . , 2001 ; Drake & Braciale , 2001 ; Drevot et al . , 2002 ; Dykstra et al . , 2001 ; Langlet et al . , 2000 ; Sharkey et al . , 1990 ; van der Goot & Harder , 2001 ) . The abundance of signalling molecules and immunoreceptors suggests a central role for rafts in modulating T - cell receptor function ( Langlet et al . , 2000 ) . Integral and peripheral membrane proteins use different strategies for raft association . Integral membrane proteins like CD36 , SNAP - 25 and caveolin - 1 contain several palmi - toylation ( Buser et al . , 1994 ; Rodgers et al . , 1994 ; Sigal et al . , 1994 ; Webb et al . , 2000 ) sites adjacent to , or just within , the cytoplasmic leaﬂet of the membrane ( Jochen & Hays , 1993 ; Monier et al . , 1996 ; Veit et al . , 1996a , b ) . Insertion of the palmitoyl chain into the lipid bilayer is energetically favourable and may provide the driving force for parti - tioning the modiﬁed protein into the raft environment ( Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . Peripheral membrane proteins contact only one side of the raft membrane . Association with the inner leaﬂet of the bilayer is frequently mediated by multiple N - terminal acylations with saturated fatty acids such as myristate or palmitate . The binding energy they provide is approximately 10 2 4 M K d , which is not sufﬁcient to anchor a protein to a membrane . Therefore , myristoylated proteins can only maintain an efﬁcient membrane interaction when a second membrane - binding site is present . This second membrane - binding site can be created by a nearby stretch of basic residues or palmitoyl chains , as in the Src family of protein kinases or the a subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins ( Buser et al . , 1994 ; Robbins et al . , 1995 ; Rodgers et al . , 1994 ; Sigal et al . , 1994 ) . Glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - linked proteins such as CD55 , PLAP and Thy - 1 ( Calafat et al . , 1983 ; Harder et al . , 1998 ; Marschang et al . , 1995 ) are the most abundant Fig . 2 . A schematic representation of the raft ﬂotation assay . The plasma membrane ( blue ) contains lipid rafts ( brown ) . Rafts contain proteins ( men ) with afﬁnity for their particular lipid com - position . The bulk phase of the plasma membrane also contains membrane proteins ( ducks ) . Fish indicate cytoplasmic proteins . Homogenization leads to the formation of membrane vesicles . Cold Triton X - 100 treatment solubilizes the bulk phase of the plasma membrane , but the raft domains remain insoluble . The raft fraction ﬂoats upon centrifugation from the bottom of a sucrose gradient , whereas cytoplasmic and dissolved plasma membrane proteins remain at the bottom of the tube . 760 Journal of General Virology 84 J .

Fuller Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 21 Jun 2019 03 : 20 : 08 proteins associated with the outer leaﬂet of the raft bilayer . They are synthesized initially as transmembrane proteins . The transmembrane region is then proteolytically cleaved and replaced by a pre - assembled glycolipid . Consequently , the modiﬁed polypeptide chains are anchored to the membrane only through the glycolipid modiﬁcation . Most GPI - anchored proteins are raft associated through the long , saturated acyl and alkyl chains of their lipid anchors ( Benting et al . , 1999 ; Brown , 1994 , 1998 ; Brown & London , 1998 ; Brown & Rose , 1992 ; Melkonian et al . , 1999 ; Rodgers et al . , 1994 ; Schroeder et al . , 1994 ) . The presence of GPI - anchored proteins in the outer leaﬂet of the raft bilayer can be regulated by phospholipase C activity , resulting in the release of GPI - anchored molecules from the plasma membrane ( Brown et al . , 1994 ) . Likewise , integral membrane proteins and proteins attached to the cytosolic face of the raft membrane can be controlled by reversible palmitoylation ( Robinson et al . , 1995 ) . These mechanisms allow ﬂexible control and suggest that raft microdomains are dynamic membrane assemblies . In summary , rafts are dynamic structures that restrict their lipid and protein composition quantitatively but not absolutely . Once formed , rafts recruit other components by their afﬁnity with the initial raft components . Exclusion appears passive . Components that lack afﬁnity for the initial ones will not be concentrated in the raft region . This effect is cooperative ; as the composition of the raft changes due to the incorporation of components , the strength of the attraction increases ( Benting et al . , 1999 ; Brown & London , 1998 ; van der Goot & Harder , 2001 ) . Evidence for rafts in virus assembly Similar modiﬁcations to those seen on cellular raft proteins are found on several viral proteins . Retroviral Gag proteins are myristoylated and the glycoproteins of retroviruses , ﬁloviruses and inﬂuenza viruses may be palmitoylated ( Ito et al . , 2001 ; Schmidt , 1982 , 1984 ; Yang et al . , 1995 ) . There is increasing evidence that a number of virus proteins , with or without modiﬁcations , are raft associated and that assembly and budding of virions may take place through rafts . The acid test of whether or not a virus assembles and buds through lipid rafts is whether or not the lipid composition of its membrane reﬂects the lipid composition of a raft and differs from the bulk cellular lipid composition . In practice , however , viruses are usually classiﬁed as raft viruses based on an assortment of more indirect methods that assay instead for raft - associated phenomena . They can be divided loosely into ﬁve general approaches : ( 1 ) co - ﬂotation with DRMs and associated marker proteins in density gradients after cold detergent treatment ( see above ) . This is the most widely used raft assay for both viruses and cellular proteins ; ( 2 ) observing punctate co - localization with raft markers in the plasma membrane by immunoﬂuorescence ; ( 3 ) measur - ing the incorporation of raftophilic molecules into virions ; ( 4 ) biophysical experiments to deﬁne the ﬂuidity of the lipid environment in the viral membrane ; and ( 5 ) looking for blocks to virus assembly and budding after raft disruption , normally induced by cholesterol depletion – it is important to remember the limitations of these methods when interpreting resulting observations . The Triton X - 100 - extractability assay , while widespread , is not used with sufﬁcient uniformity that comparison of results from different laboratories is straightforward . In the case of HIV there is evidence that the coarseness of commonly used density gradients disguises the fact that Gag – membrane complexes ﬂoat at a slightly higher density than conventional rafts ( Lindwasser & Resh , 2001 ) . Other combinations of detergent and temperature can be used to isolate raft - like membrane domains , which may have different compositions to those preserved in Triton X - 100 at 4 ˚ C ( Roper et al . , 2000 ) . It was reported recently that T - cell receptor - containing rafts could be isolated using polyoxyethylene ether detergents ( Brij ) at 37 ˚ C ( Drevot et al . , 2002 ) . In the absence of an analysis of lipid composition , it is difﬁcult to conclusively link ﬂotation at a particular density to presence in membrane microdomains . Furthermore , when viral proteins are observed in association with detergent - insoluble fractions in infected cells , the possibility that this occurs during transport of the proteins prior to assembly should be considered . The incorporation of raftophilic proteins into the viral envelope provides evidence of raft - mediated assembly only if relative concentrations in the plasma membrane are considered properly . Biophysical results indicating reduced ﬂexibility of lipid tails in the viral membrane may be difﬁcult to interpret in the presence of highly ordered viral proteins , which may themselves induce ordering of lipids . Interpreting the effects of raft disruption on virus assembly is also potentially dangerous . The depletion of cholesterol is likely to have widespread effects on cellular processes and it is difﬁcult to attribute exclusively any deleterious effects on virus assembly to raft disruption . Alternatively , cholesterol may have a structural role in the budded virus beyond any contribution to raft formation , as is the case in SFV ( Ahn et al . , 2002 ; Lu & Kielian , 2000 ) . Despite these considerations , there is compelling evidence for the involvement of rafts in the assembly of a number of different non - icosahedral enveloped viruses . Retroviruses The majority of retrovirus studies are on HIV - 1 . Flotation assays have been carried out on the Gag protein and its cleavage product , MA , the Env protein and its cleavage products , TM and SU , and the Nef protein . Triton X - 100 treatment ranged from 3 min at 0 ? 5 % to 20 min at 0 ? 25 % to 1 h at 1 % . Three - step gradients have been commonly used and varied from 73 R 10 % gradients to 40 R 5 % http : / / vir . sgmjournals . org 761 Review : Lipid rafts and virus assembly Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 21 Jun 2019 03 : 20 : 08 gradients . This means that DRMs were isolated at interfaces ranging between 65 and 10 % and 30 and 5 % . HIV proteins were found throughout the gradients , but typically a number of fractions at the bottom of the gradient and around the interface were pooled to represent the soluble and raft components . Any attempt to quantify must therefore be critically dependent on the gradient used . Given that no two groups have used identical conditions , it is impossible to accurately compare their results . Nevertheless , some con - sistent patterns do emerge . Nguyen & Hildreth ( 2000 ) found 90 % of myristoylated Gag associated with DRMs and approximately 35 and 25 % of MA and TM , respectively . Ono & Freed ( 2001 ) found 25 % of Gag in the raft fractions , which was half of the membrane - associated Gag . Given that the DRMs represent only a small fraction of the plasma membrane , this represents a signiﬁcant concentrating effect . Zheng et al . ( 2001 ) found that the concentration of Gag in the DRMs was 14 times higher than that in the soluble fraction and almost three times that in the plasma mem - brane . This concentrating effect was Nef dependent ( Zheng et al . , 2001 ) . Nef itself is also enriched in DRMs ( Wang et al . , 2000 ; Zheng et al . , 2001 ) . Gp160 was found to be raft asso - ciated using both a ﬂotation assay ( Pickl et al . , 2001 ) and a simple test for insolubility in cold Triton X - 100 ( Rousso et al . , 2000 ) . Rousso and colleagues observed that insolubility in cold Triton X - 100 was dependent on the palmitoylation of at least one of the two cytoplasmic palmitoylation sites . Lindwasser & Resh ( 2001 ) examined the ﬂotation of Gag on multiple - step Optiprep gradients and found that while 6 – 8 % of Gag ﬂoats in the raft fraction ( marked by GM1 and caveolin - 1 ) , about 30 % of Gag was found at a slightly higher density . A reduction in Gag multimerization relocates some of this Gag to the raft fraction . These authors ( Lindwasser & Resh , 2001 ) termed these protein - containing domains ‘barges’ . Such observations highlight the limitations of three - step gradients . A recent article ( Ding et al . , 2003 ) explores this issue and shows that HIV - 1 Gag rafts are more dense than classical lipid rafts . Gag and Env co - localize in a punctate pattern in transfected Cos cells ( Hermida - Matsumoto & Resh , 2000 ) . A similar pattern of co - localization is seen between Env and GM1 ( Pickl et al . , 2001 ) . Nguyen & Hildreth ( 2000 ) observed co - localization of an anti - HIV polyclonal antibody with a number of raft markers in infected Jurkat cells , but in broad patches rather than the small points observed by the other groups . Non - raft proteins were excluded from these areas . The same authors demonstrated that raftophilic proteins and GM1 were all incorporated into virions , despite being present in low concentrations on the cell surface . In con - trast , the highly expressed CD45 was not incorporated into virions . Cholesterol depletion leads to a decrease in virus infectivity ( Ono & Freed , 2001 ; Zheng et al . , 2001 ) , which is Nef dependent ( Zheng et al . , 2001 ) , as expected for a system in which assembly is mediated by rafts . Crucially , the viral membrane is known to be enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol relative to the plasma membrane ( Aloia et al . , 1988 , 1993 ) . There is therefore a signiﬁcant weight of evidence supporting a role for lipid rafts in the assembly of HIV . Moloney murine leukaemia virus was also studied by Pickl et al . ( 2001 ) . They observed ﬂotation of Gag and Env , co - localization of Env and GM1 , incorporation of raftophiles into virions and a reduction in virus titre after cholesterol depletion , implying that this retrovirus also assembles at raft domains . They also observed pseudotyping of virus particles with Env proteins from HIV , VSV and inﬂuenza virus . Inﬂuenza virus Neuraminidase ( Barman & Nayak , 2000 ; Zhang et al . , 2000 ) and HA ( Pickl et al . , 2001 ; Zhang et al . , 2000 ) both ﬂoat in the raft fraction of cell lysates . HA is also found ﬂoating in density gradients of Triton X - 100 - treated virus prepara - tions . This behaviour is dependent on their cytoplasmic tails ( Zhang et al . , 2000 ) . Co - localization of HA and raft markers in patches on the cell surface can be observed after cross - linking and GM1 is found incorporated into virions ( Pickl et al . , 2001 ) . Electron paramagnetic resonance suggests the presence of two different domains with fast and slow oxygen collision rates ( Kawasaki et al . , 2001 ) . The authors attri - buted the less mobile domain to a protein - rich raft domain . Diphenylhexatriene ﬂuorescence polarization , used as a measure of acyl chain order , also suggests the presence of highly ordered domains within the viral envelope ( Scheiffele et al . , 1999 ) . Zhang et al . ( 2000 ) demonstrated that reducing the raft association of HA and neuraminidase , by deleting regions in their cytoplasmic tails , lowered the amount of cholesterol and sphingomyelin in the virion . Scheiffele et al . ( 1997 ) showed that HA expressed in a different lipid environment , namely the membrane of VSV , is not DRM associated ( Scheiffele et al . , 1997 ) . They also demonstrated that the detergent resistance of the sphingomyelin within the inﬂu - enza virus membrane is dependent on the presence of cholesterol . These results demonstrate the inter - dependence of both lipid and protein components in moulding the properties of the inﬂuenza virus membrane . Vesicular stomatitis virus Flotation assays with VSV give contradictory results . Pickl et al . ( 2001 ) found the VSV glycoprotein ( VSV - G ) associated with DRMs , whereas Scheiffele et al .

Although essentially the same gradient was used , the second group carried out a signiﬁcantly shorter centrifuga - tion step ( 2 h as opposed to 16 h ) , confounding compar - isons between the ﬁndings . In the same work , Pickl et al . ( 2001 ) observed co - localization of HA - tagged VSV - G with GM1 in patches on the plasma membrane . 762 Journal of General Virology 84 J . A . G . Briggs , T . Wilk and S . D . Fuller Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 21 Jun 2019 03 : 20 : 08 There is a signiﬁcant body of work on the lipid composition of the VSV envelope . It is clear that the envelope is enriched in cholesterol and sphingomyelin when compared to the membrane from which it buds ( Patzer et al . , 1978 ; Pessin & Glaser , 1980 ) . The high cholesterol content leads to an increase in membrane rigidity ( Lisi et al . , 1993 ) . Glyco - protein ( G ) and M protein can induce the formation of domains with a similar composition to the viral envel - ope when incorporated into large vesicles in vitro ( Luan et al . , 1995 ) . There is evidence for incorporation of a wide range of foreign proteins into the VSV envelope . Pseudotyping of VSV has been observed with togaviruses , retroviruses , bunyaviruses , arenaviruses , paramyxoviruses , orthomyxo - viruses , coronaviruses , herpesviruses and poxviruses ( Altstein et al . , 1976 ; Calafat et al . , 1983 ; Dragunova & Za´vada , 1979 ; Lukashevich & Za´vada , 1982 ; Pastorekova et al . , 1992 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1977 ; Zajac et al . , 1980 ; Za´vada , 1972b ; Za´vada et al . , 1972 , 1978 , 1983 ; Zavadova & Za´vada , 1980 ) . CD4 is incorporated efﬁciently ( Schnell et al . , 1996 ) . Confusingly , although murine leukaemia virus envelope proteins can pseudotype with VSV ( Witte & Baltimore , 1977 ) , HIV - 1 gp160 is excluded ( Johnson et al . , 1998 ; Owens & Rose , 1993 ) . Mutagenesis revealed that if all of the gp160 cytoplasmic domain is removed , the protein is incorporated efﬁciently into VSV virions , but truncations that leave 10 or 29 amino acids are still excluded . Strangely , replacement of the cytoplasmic domain with that of CD4 ( which is incor - porated efﬁciently into VSV ) does not permit incorporation ( Johnson et al . , 1998 ) . Failure to incorporate correlates with a different cell surface localization to that of VSV - G . Johnson et al . ( 1998 ) propose that the cytoplasmic domain of gp160 contains a signal inhibiting co - localization with VSV - G and suggest that a similar signal is generated in the CD4 tail by a change in folding when it is in combination with the gp160 transmembrane domain . If VSV - G and gp160 are expressed in the absence of other VSV proteins , the differences in localization become less dramatic but nevertheless persist . It appears difﬁcult to interpret these observations in the context of raft association . All three of the truncated tail constructs lack both palmitoylation sites , at least one of which appears necessary for raft association of gp160 ( Rousso et al . , 2000 ) . These results may perhaps be reconciled best by suggesting that VSV proteins associate with raft - like membrane domains with a composition that differs to some extent from that of classical rafts . The properties of these domains would be inﬂuenced by the proteins within them , leading to the observed changes in localization of VSV - G and gp160 in the absence of VSV - M . The differences between these raft - like domains might also be blurred when raft - associated proteins were expressed at extremely high levels , such as during virus co - infections . Certain proteins , such as CD4 , would be enriched in both types of domains , whereas others would be more speciﬁc to one or the other . This might provide a partial explanation for contradictory ﬂotation results and also help to explain the exclusion of HIV gp160 from VSV virions . The results of double infections in polar cells are informative . Rodriguez - Boulan et al . ( 1983 ) showed that inﬂuenza viruses , such as WSN , bud from the apical surface of polarized Madin – Darby canine kidney cells , while VSV buds from the basolateral surface . This has been demon - strated amply in singly infected cells ( Fuller et al . , 1984 ; Fuller , 1987 ; Pfeiffer et al . , 1985 ; Roth et al . , 1979 ; Simons & Fuller , 1985 ) . During early infection in doubly infected cells , both viruses maintain their polar budding ( Roth & Compans , 1981 ) . At later times in infection , pseudotypic particles are formed in which WSN glycoproteins are incorporated into VSV virions ( Roth & Compans , 1981 ) . Up to three - quarters of VSV infectivity can be neutralized by anti - WSN antibody . The start of pseudotype formation correlates with the loss of tight junction integrity , and therefore polarity , as a result of the cytopathic effect of infection . Doubly infected non - polarized baby hamster kidney cells produce pseudotypes without any lag time . Hence , pseudotype formation requires that both glycopro - teins be present in the same epithelial cell domain . Other potential raft viruses A number of measles virus proteins ﬂoat in sucrose density gradient of Triton X - 100 - treated cells in a cholesterol - dependent fashion ( Manie et al . , 2000 ) . Similar observations have been made for Ebola and Marburg viruses ( Bavari et al . , 2002 ) . These ﬁloviruses were also shown to incorporate GM1 , but not the transferrin receptor . The viral glycopro - tein and GM1 also co - localize on the cell surface . Res - piratory syncytial virus has been shown to assemble within GM1 - rich microdomains ( Brown et al . , 2002 ) and will form pseudotypes with VSV ( Kahn et al . , 1999 , 2001 ) . The role of rafts in virus assembly It is becoming clear that rafts play a role in the assembly of a number of different non - icosahedral viruses . One way of addressing this function of rafts is to contrast the mechanism of assembly of membrane viruses that appear to employ rafts with those that do not . SFV is a typical example of an icosahedral virus that does not appear to utilize lipid rafts in its formation . SFV and other alphaviruses such as Sindbis virus and Ross River virus ( Cheng et al . , 1995 ; Kielian & Helenius , 1986 ; Schlesinger & Schlesinger , 1986 ; Zhang et al . , 2002 ) assemble in a well - deﬁned manner ( Kielian , 1995 ; Kielian & Helenius , 1986 ; Kielian et al . , 1990 ; Schlesinger & Schlesinger , 1986 ; Simons & Garoff , 1980 ; Simons & Warren , 1984 ) . A capsid is formed in the cytoplasm during incorporation of the single strand of genomic RNA ( Simons & Warren , 1984 ) . The capsid has a T = 4 hexamer – pentamer arrangement involving 240 copies of the capsid protein surrounding the RNA ( Fuller et al . , 1995 ) . The envelope proteins of the virus are transported through the trans - Golgi network , where they are processed http : / / vir . sgmjournals . org 763 Review : Lipid rafts and virus assembly Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Fri , 21 Jun 2019 03 : 20 : 08 to generate the fusion active mature spike , to the cell surface . There is reasonable evidence that the spikes form a hexa - gonal array at the cell surface ( von Bonsdorff & Harrison , 1978 ) , which presents an array of spike tails on the cyto - plasmic side of the bilayer . This acts as an interaction site for the capsid . The icosahedral nature of the ﬁnal structure allows the visualization of the geometry . The assembled virus shows complementarity between the array of spikes and the capsid that allows precise interaction over the icosahedral surface ( Fuller et al . , 1995 ; Mancini et al . , 2000 ) . The hexagonal arrangement of the spikes is spaced so that it can interact with the hexamer – pentamer arrangement of the capsid proteins . This results in the incorporation of precisely 80 copies of the trimeric spike complex to match the 240 copies of capsid protein . The arrangement is complemen - tary , since individual trimeric spikes interact with two hexamers and one pentamer of capsid ( Fuller et al . , 1995 ; Mancini et al . , 2000 ) . This complementarity yields a very precise control of composition . Loss of a single spike would result in lack of complementarity over the array and loss of interactions over several spikes ( Lescar et al . , 2001 ; Mancini et al . , 2000 ) . There are no convincing reports of the incorporation of unrelated virus envelope proteins into SFV . This model for SFV assembly differs from the one suggested by the hybrid retrovirus particles in Fig . 1 . An important distinction is that the curvature of the membrane in a non - icosahedral raft virus is accomplished both by protein – protein interactions of the internal proteins of the virus , and their interactions with the inner leaﬂet of the lipid bilayer . Compare this with an icosahedral virus such as SFV , where the curvature of the membrane is dictated exclusively by the curvature of the two organized protein layers that sandwich it . This gives a raft virus greater ﬂexibility in both the protein composition of the viral membrane and the geometry of the virion . In addition , assembly is dependent on the composition of the lipid bilayer . Retroviruses are an extreme example of this . Virus - like particles can form by expression of Gag alone without the presence of the Env proteins . The geometry of the particles formed does not show the consistent shape or size expected for a non - raft virus . The steps leading to assembly of a raft virus take advantage of the dynamic properties of lipid rafts and the fact that the viral proteins are raftophilic . The cellular membrane never has the smooth , random distribution of lipids and proteins described in the early ﬂuid membrane model ( Singer & Nicolson , 1972 ) . This model is too simple a description , since cellular proteins and lipids will tend to form micro - domains of selected lipid composition . As shown in Fig . 3 , pre - existing rafts are dynamic structures but they turn the smooth homogeneous ﬂuid membrane of the early model into a landscape of locally varying lipid composition ( 1 ) . Virus infection leads to the production of viral proteins and their expression at the cell surface ( 2 ) . The afﬁnity of the viral proteins for particular lipid populations will lead to recruitment of more of those lipids and their enrichment in the neighbourhood of the proteins ( 3 ) . This will result in the formation of rafts enriched in lipids that have afﬁnity for the viral protein and the recruitment of further lipids and proteins with similar afﬁnity . This process would continue until the collection of viral proteins and their interaction with the inner leaﬂet of the membrane results in curvature and budding ( 4 ) . There are several consequences of such a model . Assembly Fig . 3 . A model for raft virus assembly . The proposed role of rafts in virus assembly is depicted . The plasma membrane con - tains domains of locally varying lipid composition ( 1 ) . Virus infection leads to the production of viral proteins and their dis - tribution to the cell surface ( 2 ) .

This process would continue until the collection of viral proteins and their interaction with the inner leaﬂet of the membrane results in curvature and budding ( 4 ) . 764 Journal of General Virology 84 J .

Budding could result from the coal - escence of separate domains so long as the result provided sufﬁcient curvature to close the membrane . Cooperativity would be key to the budding process , but there is inherent ﬂexibility in the protein composition of the resulting membrane . The pseudotypic paradox can be resolved by this limited ﬂexibility . Gag and other M - like proteins would be raftophiles . Their recruitment by rafts and ability to recruit and concentrate other raftophiles is shared across many virus families . The protein layer forming under the mem - brane is selective , but not tightly so , and can incorporate proteins non - speciﬁcally or be found adjacent to a protein lattice of differing composition within the same raft . Pseudotyping is not a paradox if one gives up the search for a common protein structural feature that is shared between a broad range of viruses . Raft viruses are not precise builders like their non - raft counterparts and when they are sharing a crowded building site it is inevitable that they occasionally pick up each others’ bricks .
