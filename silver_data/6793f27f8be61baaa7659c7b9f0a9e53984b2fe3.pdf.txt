Current antiretroviral treatments do not target this persistent population of proviruses which 22 include latently infected cells that upon treatment interruption can be reactivated to contribute to 23 HIV - 1 rebound . Deep sequencing of persistent HIV proviruses has revealed that greater than 90 % 24 of integrated HIV genomes are defective and unable to produce infectious virions . We 25 hypothesized that intragenic elements in the HIV genome support transcription of aberrant HIV - 1 26 RNAs from defective proviruses that lack long terminal repeats ( LTRs ) . Using an intact provirus 27 detection assay , we observed that resting CD4 + T cells and monocyte - derived macrophages 28 ( MDMs ) are biased towards generating defective HIV - 1 proviruses . Multiplex reverse transcription 29 digital drop PCR identified Env and Nef transcripts which lacked 5’ untranslated regions ( UTR ) in 30 acutely infected CD4 + T cells and MDMs indicating transcripts are generated that do not utilize 31 the promoter within the LTR . 5’UTR - deficient Env transcripts were also identified in a cohort of 32 people living with HIV ( PLWH ) on ART , suggesting that these aberrant RNAs are produced in 33 vivo . Using 5’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) , we mapped the start site of these 34 transcripts within the Env gene . This region bound several cellular transcription factors and 35 functioned as a transcriptional regulatory element that could support transcription and translation 36 of downstream HIV - 1 RNAs . These studies provide mechanistic insights into how defective HIV - 37 1 proviruses are persistently expressed to potentially drive inflammation in PLWH . 38 Author Summary 39 People living with HIV establish a persistent reservoir which includes latently infected cells that 40 fuel viral rebound upon treatment interruption . However , the majority of HIV - 1 genomes in these 41 persistently infected cells are defective . Whether these defective HIV genomes are expressed 42 and whether they contribute to HIV associated diseases including accelerated aging , 43 neurodegenerative symptoms , and cardiovascular diseases are still outstanding questions . In this 44 3 paper , we demonstrate that acute infection of macrophages and resting T cells is biased towards 45 generating defective viruses which are expressed by DNA regulatory elements in the HIV 46 genome . These studies describe an alternative mechanism for chronic expression of HIV 47 genomes . 48 49 4 INTRODUCTION 50 HIV - 1 establishes a persistent infection by integrating into the host genome that can only be fully 51 eradicated by the elimination of infected cells . Although antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) restricts viral 52 replication and disease progression , it only slowly diminishes the persistent reservoir ( 1 , 2 ) . 53 Furthermore , a subset of persistently infected cells harbor transcriptionally repressed HIV - 1 54 proviruses which , upon reactivation , fuel the rapid rebound of HIV - 1 replication and infection upon 55 ART discontinuation . Understanding the mechanisms that establish and maintain persistent and 56 latent HIV - 1 infections are required for effective HIV cure strategies . 57 58 Persistent HIV - 1 infection is also postulated to contribute to inflammation and chronic immune 59 activation associated with systemic diseases , even in patients treated with antiretroviral drugs 60 that have undetectable HIV - 1 expression ( 3 – 10 ) People living with HIV - 1 receiving ART continue 61 to suffer from inflammatory associated co - morbidities including neurological deficits , frailty , and 62 cardiovascular disease ( 8 ) . It has been demonstrated that innate immune sensing of HIV - 1 intron 63 containing RNAs in infected macrophages , results in induction of MAVS - dependent interferon 64 type I and pro - inflammatory responses ( 11 , 12 ) . However , whether other mechanisms contribute 65 to this persistent inflammation and immune dysfunction are poorly understood . 66 67 Studies examining the proviral landscape using next generation deep sequencing approaches 68 show that the HIV - 1 reservoir is diverse and dynamic , changing over the course of time ( 13 – 16 ) . 69 Approximately 90 % of HIV - 1 proviruses sequenced from peripheral blood samples from 70 antiretroviral treated HIV patients have crippling mutations including large deletions of the genome 71 that would prevent the generation of infectious HIV - 1 particles ( 17 , 18 ) . A subset of CD4 + T cells 72 harboring defective proviruses generate polypeptides that are presented in the context of MHC I . 73 Cells presenting such peptides can be targeted by CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) , thereby 74 5 shaping the HIV - 1 provirus reservoir and potentially redirecting adaptive HIV - 1 immunity ( 19 , 20 ) . 75 These reports indicate that subsets of defective proviruses are expressed and influence immune 76 cell function . Importantly , what regulates the expression of defective proviruses and how they 77 contribute to persistent HIV - associated inflammation has not been reported . 78 79 We hypothesize that defective provirus transcription is regulated by intragenic transcriptional 80 elements . We demonstrate that acute infection of resting CD4 + T cells and monocyte - derived - 81 macrophages are biased towards generating defective proviruses , many that lack 5’ long terminal 82 repeats and despite these deletions still express HIV - 1 RNAs and proteins . Importantly , we detect 83 these mRNAs in a subset of people living with HIV on ART . We also identify the intragenic 84 transcriptional elements that regulate the expression of these aberrant RNAs . These studies 85 provide mechanistic insights into how defective HIV - 1 proviruses are persistently expressed to 86 potentially drive inflammation . 87 88 89 6 RESULTS 90 Acute infection of resting CD4 + T cells and macrophages generate defective HIV - 1 91 proviruses . We hypothesized that acute HIV - 1 infection of resting and quiescent cells biases 92 infection towards defective proviruses . To determine the ratio of intact and defective provirus 93 present in resting CD4 + T cells , activated CD4 + T cells , and macrophages following acute HIV - 1 94 infection , we utilized an intact provirus detection assay ( IPDA ) ( 18 ) , Figure 1A , Supplemental 95 Figure 1A ) . CD4 + T cells were either unstimulated or activated with anti - CD3 / anti - CD28 beads 96 prior to infection with HIV - 1 VSVgNL4 - 3 , whereas monocyte derived macrophages ( MDMs ) were 97 infected with R5 - tropic HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 BaL . Infected cells were cultured for at least 48 - hours to allow the 98 completion of reverse transcription and integration ( Supplemental Figure 1B ) . Genomic DNA from 99 infected cells was used as template for IPDA droplet digital PCR ( ddPCR ) . IPDA showed that 100 activated CD4 + T cells had a higher frequency ( > 90 % ) of intact HIV provirus when compared to 101 resting CD4 + T cells or MDMs ( Figure 1A , B ) which had on average 25 % and 40 % intact 102 proviruses , respectively . Approximately 50 - 60 % of proviruses detected in both resting CD4 + T 103 cells and MDMs were defective with the majority of proviruses harboring 5’ - deletions . The non - 104 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Efavirenz ( EFV ) was used as a negative control to 105 assure that IPDA signals were dependent on reverse transcription and were not contaminating 106 DNA ( Supplemental Figure 2 ) . These results support that defective HIV proviruses are generated 107 in both resting CD4 + T cells and MDMs after an acute infection , and the activation state of CD4 + 108 T cells influences efficient establishment of intact proviruses . 109 7 110 111 Proviruses lacking 5’LTRs are transcribed . Several studies demonstrated that defective HIV 112 proviruses are transcribed and translated ( 19 , 20 ) . To determine if the provirus populations 113 detected in HIV - 1 infected CD4 + T cells and MDMs were transcriptionally competent , we adapted 114 a reverse transcription ddPCR assay ( RT - ddPCR ) originally described by Yukl et al ( 21 ) by 115 multiplexing probes for simultaneous detection of transcripts spanning the R - U5 - Gag junction 116 ( “LTR” probe ) , distal transcripts ( “Nef” probe ) , and sequences that included both upstream and 117 distal sequences ( 5’ UTR / Nef double positives , Supplemental Figure 3 ) ( 22 , 23 ) . Multiplex RT - 118 ddPCR performed using infected CD4 + T cell cDNA detected transcripts which included 5’ 119 untranslated region ( UTR ) sequence only and double - positive 5’ UTR - Nef transcripts . We also 120 detected Nef - positive transcripts which did not include 5’ UTR sequence in HIV infected CD4 + T 121 A B F i gu r e 1 .

We further multiplexed the RT - ddPCR by including an Env primer and 123 probe combination allowing for the detection of 7 different HIV - 1 RNAs ( Supplemental Figure 3 ) . 124 The multiplex RT - ddPCR identified two general sets of transcripts in CD4 + T cells and MDMs ; a 125 set of RNAs that contained 5’ UTR sequences and a set of RNAs that were positive for distal 126 RNAs env and nef but lacked 5’ UTRs . The relative levels of RNAs with and without 5’UTRs 127 differed between the infected CD4 + T cell populations with approximately 40 % of RNAs in 128 activated CD4 + T cells lacking 5’ UTRs compared to 66 % of RNAs lacking 5’ UTRs in resting 129 cells . These frequencies correlated with IPDA data which showed that resting CD4 + T cells harbor 130 more defective proviruses . ( Figure 2B , 2C ) . We also observed approximately 25 % of RNAs in 131 infected MDMs lacked 5’ UTRs ( Figure 2D , E , F ) . Using a poly d ( T ) primer instead of random 132 hexamers for the RT reactions resulted in the amplification and detection of 5’UTR deficient 133 transcripts in CD4 + T cells and MDMs , indicating that a subset of these RNAs were 134 polyadenylated ( See Supplemental Figure 4 ) . These data support that aberrant HIV transcripts 135 are produced after acute HIV - 1 infection , with their relative expression influenced by cell type and 136 activation state . 137 9 138 Chronically infected individuals on ART demonstrate a gradual decrease in intact HIV proviruses 139 concurrent with selection and expansion of defective proviruses due to sustained immunological 140 pressure and clearance ( 15 , 17 – 19 , 24 ) . Notably , defective HIV proviruses are observed to decay 141 at a slower rate than intact provirus clones , presumably due to their relatively low HIV - 1 142 expression levels ( 13 , 23 – 26 ) . We posit that HIV - 1 mRNA lacking 5’ UTRs should be detected in 143 people living with HIV ( PLWH ) on ART . Using DNA isolated from PBMCs of PLWH on ART 144 ( Supplemental Table 2 ) , we first confirmed the presence of HIV - 1 proviruses in chronically 145 infected individuals by IPDA with most proviruses detected in these individuals being defective 146 ( Figure 3A ) .

Probes specific for LTR and Env were used in tandem to determine the presence of one 149 or both probe sites on HIV - 1 transcripts expressed in HIV - positive donor PBMCs . Multiplex RT - 150 ddPCR assays successfully detected HIV - 1 RNAs with 5’UTR as well as Env transcripts that 151 lacked 5’ UTR start sites ( Figure 3 B , C ) . Env sequences lacking 5’UTRs were detected with 152 signal above uninfected PBMC background controls in 10 / 11 RNA samples from HIV - positive 153 PBMC donors ( Figure 3B , Supplemental Table 2 ) . These data show that aberrant HIV transcripts 154 are detected in a subset of individuals chronically infected with HIV even during ART suggesting 155 these RNAs are persistently expressed in PLWH . 156 157 158 Defective proviruses are generated from intragenic transcriptional elements . In the context 159 of intact proviruses , the 5’ LTR includes the cis - regulatory elements that recruit and coordinate 160 host transcription factors to initiate and regulate HIV - 1 transcription . The mechanisms by which 161 HIV transcription is regulated in defective HIV proviruses that lack a functional 5’ LTR remains 162 incompletely described . We hypothesized that there are intragenic sequences that support 163 transcription of defective HIV - 1 proviruses . Previous reports that support this hypothesis include 164 A B F i gu r e 3 .

A universal forward 168 primer and a gene - specific reverse primer for nef ( Supplemental Table # 1 ) were used to amplify 169 the populations of nef containing transcripts from infected cells . PCR products were separated by 170 gel electrophoresis and ~ 1kb RACE PCR products were gel extracted , cloned into a pUC19 - 171 based vector , and 43 products were sequenced to map their 5’ ends . MDM and CD4 + T cell 172 sequences demonstrated that 46 . 5 % of the transcripts were splice products which initiated at the 173 transcriptional start site within the 5’ LTR sequence ( Figure 4A , B ) . The remaining 53 . 4 % of 174 sequences initiated transcription within the Env gene , across a span of approximately 200 175 nucleotides located between + 7760 to + 8178 bp downstream of the canonical 5’ LTR 176 transcriptional start site . These data support that transcription initiates from intragenic sites of the 177 HIV genome . Based on the RACE data , we used Promoter 2 . 0 ( 33 ) and ElementNT V2 ( 34 ) to 178 predict if promoter characteristics were within the Env region . These bioinformatic tools predicted 179 a transcriptional start site ( 7800 bp , score 1 . 141 ) and TATA box motifs ( 7483 - 7488 bp and 7662 - 180 7669 bp ) within the Env sequence , adjacent to the start sites identified by 5’ RACE ( Figure 4B ) . 181 To survey direct binding of human transcription factors within the HIV proviral genome , we 182 performed a functional enhanced yeast one - hybrid screen ( eY1H ) ( 35 – 37 ) . This method allows 183 for high - throughput screening of host transcription factor binding events to the HIV - 1 genome . In 184 brief , HIV bait sequences were generated by tiling the HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 genome into 17 overlapping 185 fragments ( Supplemental Table 3 ) . Fragments were cloned upstream of the two reporter genes , 186 LacZ or HIS3 . Yeasts were transformed with reporter constructs as well as a library representing 187 66 % of the known human transcription factors fused to the yeast activation domain , Gal4 . 188 Transcription factor binding hits were identified as yeast colonies that grew in the absence of 189 12 histidine and were blue when provided X - Gal . The eY1H screen detected 60 transcription factor - 190 DNA interactions , representing 43 unique transcription factors which bound to six regions within 191 the HIV - 1 genome ( Supplemental Table 4 ; Figure 4C , ( desiginated 2 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 15 and 16 ) ) . 192 Transcription factor binding hot spots were clustured within and near HIV Env gene , whereas , 193 transcription factor binding was not detected in Pol ( Regions 3 - 9 ) . Identified transcription factors 194 included homeobox , basic helix - loop - helix , and zinc finger families ( Supplemental Table 4 ) . The 195 distribution of transcription factor binding hotspots near the HIV Env gene correlated with the 196 transcriptional start site suggested by the 5’ RACE results . To investigate if these intragenic 197 sequences that bound host transcription factors function as cis - regulatory elements , reporter 198 vectors were generated with HIV - 1 fragments cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene . 199 Reporter plasmids were transiently transfected in HEK293T cells , and firefly luciferase was 200 assessed 24 hours post - transfection ( Figure 4D ) . Most of the intragenic sequences , including 201 Regions 11 and 16 , which bound several transcription factors in the eY1H assays , modestly 202 influence transcription of the reporter gene . However , regions 14 and 15 , which spanned 203 sequences 7001 to 8521 bp in Env and bound several transcription factors in the eY1H assays , 204 exhibited 5 - 10 fold higher luciferase signal compared to pcDNA3 control . These sequences also 205 spanned sites that included putative promoter elements and the RACE transcriptional start sites . 206 13 207 In addition , we generated a viral expression construct , pNL4 - 3∆5’ in which we deleted 208 approximately 6 , 000 bp of the 5’ end of the provirus , including the 5’ LTR , Gag and Pol genes , 209 and transfected this construct into HEK293T cells ( Figure 5A ) . Transcription of Env containing 210 sequences was detected by RT - ddPCR ( Figure 5B ) . Furthermore , 35 kd and 19 kd proteins were 211 detected by immunoblotting when whole cell lysates from pNL4 - 3∆5’ transfected cells were 212 probed with human HIV anti - serum suggesting that these RNAs are translated ( Figure 5C ) . It 213 should be noted that immunoblots required longer exposure times to visualize the proteins 214 expressed from pNL4 - 3∆5’ pNL4 - 3∆5’ probably reflecting that these intragenic elements are 215 much weaker than the HIV - 1 5’ - LTR which increased luciferase expression on the order of ~ 200 - 216 fold compared to pcDNA control in transfected HEK293T cells ( Figure 4E ) .

These dynamics result in 233 the progressive accumulation of pauciclonal defective HIV - 1 proviral genomes which comprise 234 the vast majority of the latent reservoir in chronically infected individuals that are undergoing 235 treatment or are controllers of HIV infection ( 13 – 16 , 23 , 24 , 39 ) . In this study , we provide evidence 236 that a subset of these defective proviruses are expressed and provide insights into the 237 mechanisms that control their transcription . 238 239 We hypothesized that certain cells may be predisposed to generating defective proviruses upon 240 infection . It has been observed that quiescent and resting cell populations such as macrophages , 241 resting CD4 + cells and memory T cell subsets are difficult to infect and biased towards 242 unproductive or latent infections ( 40 – 42 ) . We compared the fate of HIV - 1 infections in 243 macrophages , unstimulated CD4 + T cells , and CD4 + T cells activated through the CD3 / CD28 244 signaling axis . At the time of infection , macrophages and unstimulated CD4 + T cells harbor more 245 defective proviruses compared to activated CD4 + T cells with up to 80 % of the infected cells 246 containing large 5’ deletions . Our results suggest that upon acute infection , even in the absence 247 of immune selection , a foundation of cells harboring defective viruses is rapidly established ( 43 ) . 248 249 The shaping of the reservoir and persistent proviral genomes has been linked to provirus 250 expression and selection by anti - HIV immune responses . For example , it has been shown that a 251 16 subset of defective viruses from individuals treated with ART can be expressed and targeted by 252 CD8 + T cells ( 17 , 38 ) . However , it is not clear how these defective proviruses are transcribed , 253 especially if a significant number of proviruses have large upstream deletions or LTR mutations . 254 The existence of intragenic promoters has been suggested for several retroviruses ( 44 – 48 ) . The 255 presence of proviral cis - regulatory elements has also been proposed within the HIV - 1 genome , 256 with reports of DNAse hypersensitive sites , methylated CpG islands , transcription factor DNA 257 binding sites and modest transcriptional activation potential ( 27 , 31 , 32 , 49 , 50 ) . However , the 258 regulatory mechanisms which control transcription of alternative transcriptional start sites in HIV 259 remain largely undescribed . We hypothesized that intragenic cis - elements exist and drive 260 transcription of a subset of the defective HIV proviral genomes . Taken together , our data 261 generated from yeast - one - hybrid transcription factor binding assays , promoter prediction 262 software , transfections with deletion and reporter plasmids , and 5’ RACE sequencing , indicate 263 cis - transcriptional elements and promoters located at approximately + 7 , 800 bp in the HIV - 1 264 proviral genome . This observed transcriptional activity overlaps with previously reported CpG 265 islands ( 50 ) . The transcripts generated originate in the Env gene , span the Tat splice junction , and 266 include intronic sequence . 267 268 Despite minimal detectable virus replication in PLWH undergoing anti - retroviral treatment , 269 immune stimulation and inflammation persist , contributing to co - morbidities including 270 neuroinflammation , cardiovascular disease , and signs of accelerated aging ( 51 – 53 ) . Previous 271 work has indicated that HIV - 1 transcripts are produced by defective proviral clones and a subset 272 of these transcripts can be translated into viral proteins that stimulate CD8 + T cell activity 273 ( 19 , 20 , 38 ) . Furthermore , cryptic HIV - 1 peptides are produced by using alternative reading frames 274 ( ARFs ) which are distributed throughout the HIV - 1 genome . Previous studies have demonstrated 275 that ARFs can be loaded into and presented by MHC - I to activate CD8 + T cells , inducing cytokine 276 release and killing activity ( 54 – 56 ) . Taken together , these data support that defective persistent 277 17 HIV proviruses influence and perpetuate immune responses against HIV . Our ability to detect 278 HIV - 1 protein from proviral sequences that lack 5’ sequences suggest that defective viruses may 279 provide and alternative mechanism to generate ARFs . 280 281 In addition , it has been demonstrated that partially spliced and unspliced HIV - 1 RNAs are 282 recognized by MAVS - dependent nucleic acid sensing pathways and mediate IFN - I responses 283 ( 11 , 12 , 57 ) . The defective mRNA sequences generated from the intragenic elements that we have 284 characterized initiate transcription within Env and span the intron leading us to speculate that 285 these mRNAs could be proinflammatory . Importantly , we detect transcripts that are initiated from 286 intragenic elements in samples from PLWH on ART . Overall , our study provides potential insight 287 into the mechanisms and proviral elements which regulate transcription of these defective HIV - 1 288 genomes and the potential of cryptic peptides that perpetuate HIV pathogenesis . 289 290 291 18 Acknowledgements 292 This work was in part funded by NIH including R01 AI138960 , R01DA055488 and DA047032 293 R61 / R33 to A .

CD4 + T cells 306 were enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from leukapheresis packs ( New 307 York Biologics ) . Negative selection was performed using EasySep Human CD4 + T Cell 308 Enrichment Kit ( Stemcell Technologies ) after Lymphoprep density gradient ( Stemcell 309 Technologies ) separation of PBMCs . Resting CD4 + T cells were cultured in Roswell Park 310 Memorial Institute medium ( RPMI ; Invitrogen ) with 100 U / mL P / S , 2 mM of L - glutamine , and 10 % 311 FBS . Flow cytometry using CD25 and CD69 markers confirmed resting CD4 + T cell phenotypes 312 ( 41 ) . CD4 + T cells were activated with anti - CD3 / CD28 Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) at a ratio of one 313 bead per cell for 72 h and maintained in RPMI with 100 U / mL IL - 2 ( AIDS Reagents Program ) and 314 100 ng / mL IL - 7 ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . Monocyte - derived - macrophages ( MDMs ) were generated by 315 positive selection of CD14 + cells from PBMCs using the EasySep Human CD14 Positive 316 Selection Kit II ( STEMCELL Technologies , Cat : 17858 ) and differentiating cells for at least 7 days 317 in RPMI supplemented with 10 % Human AB Serum ( Millipore Sigma ) , 100U / mL P / S , 2mM of L - 318 glutamine , and 20ng / mL M - CSF ( BioLegend , Cat : 574802 ) at 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 . 50 % fresh 319 media was added 2 days after plating followed by full media changes every 2 - 3 days to remove 320 non - adherent cells . 321 322 20 Viruses and Infections 323 Viral stocks of molecular clones HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 and HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 BaL ( AIDS Reagents Program ) were 324 generated by transfecting HEK293T cells using PEI transfection reagent ( Sigma , Cat : 408727 ) . 325 Pseudotyped HIV - 1 VSVg - NL4 - 3 , HEK293T cells were co - transfected with an expression vector 326 containing VSVg and HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 . HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 virus stocks titers were estimated using CEM - GFP 327 cells obtained from the AIDS Reagent Program ( 58 ) . HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 BaL virus stocks were titrated on 328 primary MDMs and IU / mL were estimated from IPDA results . All infections were performed using 329 MOI < 1 ( HIV - 1 VSVg - NL4 - 3 MOI = 0 . 1 , HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 MOI = 0 . 02 , HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 BaL MOI = 0 . 01 ) . 330 DNAse / MgCl2 + was added to cells at time of infection prior to DNA / RNA isolation to limit 331 contaminating plasmid DNA . CD4 + T cells were infected by spinoculation as previously described 332 ( 59 ) . MDMs were infected by adding HIV - 1 NL4 - 3BaL directly to the cells at 37 o C for 4 hr , washed 333 twice with PBS and maintained in fresh media . 1  M of the non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase 334 ( RT ) inhibitor Efavirenz was added prior to infection and post - infection as a negative control . 335 336 DNA / RNA Isolation 337 DNA and RNA were isolated from cells using the AllPrep DNA / RNA Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Cat : 80204 ) . 338 Briefly , cells were washed twice with PBS , treated with DNAse for 10 min prior to lysis directly in 339 cell culture plate ( MDM ) or as cell pellets ( CD4 + T cells ) using Qiagen RLT buffer supplemented 340 with  - Mercaptoethanol . Cell lysates were homogenized with Qiashredder columns ( Qiagen , 341 Cat : 79654 ) following manufacturer’s protocol for AllPrep DNA / RNA Mini Kits . RNA isolation 342 columns were treated with DNAse for > 10 minutes to remove contaminating DNA . 343 344 345 Intact Proviral DNA Assay ( IPDA ) 346 21 Probes targeting 5’ and 3’ regions of the HIV provirus were designed to bind minimally variant 347 locations as described in detailed by Bruner et al ( 18 ) . Briefly , primers and probes to amplify 348 signal from the psi region and RRE of the env region of the HIV - 1 provirus simultaneously were 349 used ( See Supplementary Table 1 ) . Signals were identified using a Bio - Rad QX200 Droplet Digital 350 PCR System and Quantasoft Data Analysis Software . 351 A hydrolysable FAM probe was designed to bind Psi sequence whereas hydrolysable VIC probe 352 was designed to bind the RRE sequence . Primers flanked probes . An unlabeled “dark probe” 353 specific for a commonly hypermutated env sequence was included in each IPDA reaction to 354 distinguish hypermutated provirus sequences . Proviruses containing hypermutated signals were 355 detected as single - positive droplets containing FAM - only signal . 356 357 Droplet Digital PCR ( ddPCR ) 358 Droplet digital PCR Reaction mixes were comprised of : 1X ddPCR Supermix ( no dUTP ) ( Bio - Rad , 359 Cat : 186 - 3024 ) , 750 nM primers , 250 nM probes . DNA was diluted to ~ 10 - 100 ng in 8  L of 360 nuclease free H 2 O per reaction . A control reaction using probes and primers for human RPP30 361 gene was performed to calculate shearing index and correct the estimated concentrations of intact 362 and defective HIV - 1 proviruses . Droplets were generated using Bio - Rad’s QX200™ Droplet 363 Generator ( Cat : 1864002 ) . 364 365 PCR conditions were : 95 o C for 10 - min enzyme activation , 94 o C for 30 - sec denaturation , 59 o C for 366 1 - min annealing / extension , repeat denaturation and annealing / extension 45 cycles , 98 o C for 10 - 367 min to inactivate enzyme . 368 369 Droplets containing PCR product were assessed on the Bio - Rad QX200 Droplet Digital PCR 370 System . Data were collected using Quantasoft Software set to copy - number variation ( CNV ) 371 mode . All experiments included a no template ( water only ) control and / or an uninfected cell 372 22 sample negative control for background probe signal . RPP30 single probe was used to estimate 373 shearing index and to correct the estimation of defective and intact proviruses . Estimations of 374 intact and defective provirus frequencies were calculated using droplet counts of single - and 375 double - positives determined by the Quantasoft software . 376 377 For RT - ddPCR , RNA was reverse transcribed to generate cDNA with RT reaction mixtures of 14 378  l of 5× SuperScript III buffer , 7  l of 50 mM MgCl2 , 3 . 5  l of random hexamers ( 50 ng /  l ) , 1 . 35 379  l of oligo dT15 ( 500ug / mL ) , 3 . 5  l of 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates ( dNTPs ) , 1 . 75  l of 380 RNAseOUT ( 40 U /  l ; Invitrogen ) , 2  l of SuperScript III RT ( 200 U /  l ; Invitrogen ) , and nuclease - 381 free dH 2 O to bring the final reaction volume to 70  L . RT was performed at 25 o C for 10 min , 50 o C 382 for 50 min , followed by an inactivation step at 85 o C for 5 min . Negative controls included reactions 383 with no RT enzyme . Supplemental Table 1 shows primers and probes for ddPCR . FAM probes 384 were designed and directed to sites throughout expected HIV transcripts . RT - ddPCR probe 385 design was based on those reported by Yukl et al ( 21 ) . ddPCR probes were multiplexed to 386 measure the frequency of probe sites simultaneously in ddPCR assays . 387 388 ART - Patient Samples 389 PBMC from patients enrolled in a study assessing inflammation and immune dysfunction in 390 people living with HIV and aging were used ( Boston University IRB - 33095 ) ( 10 ) . Inclusion criteria 391 included individuals between 18 - 35 and ≥50 years old who were on antiretroviral treatment for at 392 least 6 months . Subjects with recent active infection ( 30 days ) or on immunosuppressive therapy 393 were excluded from enrollment . See Supplemental Table # 2 for details . PBMC were isolated 394 using Ficoll - Hypaque density gradient separation and cryopreserved at - 150⁰C until use . 395 396 5’ RACE PCR 397 23 5’ - RACE PCR was performed on total RNA from VSVg - NL43 infected CD4 + T cells and MDMs 398 following the manufacturer’s protocol for SMARTer® RACE 5’ / 3’ Kit ( Takara Bio , Cat : 634858 ) . 399 Random primers were annealed to template RNA using 10X Random Primer Mix , RNA ( 1  g ) , and 400 water and incubating the mixture at 72°C for 3 min followed by cooling to 42°C for 2 min . SMARTer 401 II A Oligonucleotide ( 1  L ) was added to tag the 5’ - end of the generated cDNA providing a 402 universal forward primer binding site for subsequent PCRs . The RT reaction included template 403 RNA annealed with random primers , 5X First - Strand Buffer , DTT ( 100 mM ) , dNTPs ( 20 mM ) , 404 RNase Inhibitor ( 40 U / µl ) , Reverse Transcriptase ( 100U ) and was performed at 42°C for 90 min 405 and then cooled to 70°C for 10 min . This first - strand reaction product was diluted with 90  L of 406 Tricine - EDTA Buffer before RACE - PCR . 407 For 5’ RACE PCR a nef specific reverse primer was designed ( See Supplemental Table 1 ) . The 408 RACE reaction mixture consisted of 5’ RACE PCR sample : PCR - Grade H 2 O ( 15 . 5  L ) , 2X 409 SeqAmp Buffer ( 25  L ) , SeqAmp DNA Polymerase ( 1  L ) , 5’ RACE - Ready cDNA ( 2 . 5  L ) , 10X 410 Universal Primer Mix ( 5  L ) , 5’ gene - specific Primer ( 10  M ) . Negative controls included only the 411 universal primer mix or only the gene - specific primers . 5’ RACE PCR thermal cycling was : 94°C 412 for 30 sec , 68°C for 30 sec , 72°C for 3 min , repeated for 25 cycles . 5’ 413 RACE - PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis ( 1 % agarose ) and major PCR 414 products were excised , pooled , and subcloned into a linearized puC19 - based vector ( pRACE ) 415 using : linearized pRACE vector ( 1  L ) , Gel - purified RACE product ( 7  L ) , and In - Fusion HD 416 Master Mix ( 2  L ) . The ligation reaction was incubated for 15 min at 50°C before transforming 417 Stellar Competent Cells ( TakaraBio ) . Colonies were selected for direct bacterial colony 418 sequencing using M13F / R primers which flanked the In - Fusion cloning site of the pRACE vector 419 ( Genewiz ) . 420 421 Enhanced Yeast - 1 - Hybrid Screen 422 24 Enhanced yeast one - hybrid ( eY1H ) assays were performed as previously described ( 35 – 37 ) . 423 Briefly , the HIV - 1 NL4 - 3 genome was tiled into 17 overlapping fragments of 1000 - 1200bp in length 424 ( Supplemental Table 3 ) . “Bait” HIV DNA were cloned upstream to the yeast selection marker 425 HIS3 or the reporter gene LacZ . Constructs were transformed and integrated into yeast chromatin . 426 A library of 1 , 086 human “prey” transcription factors were linked with the yeast Gal4 activation 427 domain . Binding of the transcription factors to the DNA fragment resulted in transcription of 428 reporter genes . Positive interactions were determined as two of the four replicate colonies that 429 survived in the absence of histidine and experienced a color change in the presence of the 430 substrate X - Gal . More than 90 % of positive interactions were identified in 4 / 4 colonies ( 35 – 37 ) . 431 432 Transfection with HIV - 1 Vectors 433 HIV proviral fragments , designated regions 1 - 17 ( Supplemental Table 3 ) , were cloned in vector 434 pGL4 . 23 ( Addgene , Cat : E8411 ) upstream of the luciferase reporter gene . pcDNA3 . 1 + 435 ( ThermoFisher , Cat : V79020 ) was used as a negative control .
