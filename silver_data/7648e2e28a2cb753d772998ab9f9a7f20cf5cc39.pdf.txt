Paracrine purinergic signaling determines lung endo - thelial nitric oxide production . Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 296 : L901 – L910 , 2009 . First published March 20 , 2009 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajplung . 90549 . 2008 . —Although the vascular bed is a major source of nitric oxide ( NO ) production , factors regulating the production remain unclear . We considered the role played by para - crine signaling . Determinations by ﬂuorescence microscopy in iso - lated , blood - perfused rat and mouse lungs revealed that a brief lung expansion enhanced cytosolic Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt ) oscillations in alveolar epithelial ( AEC ) and endothelial ( EC ) cells , and NO production in EC . Furthermore , as assessed by a novel microlavage assay , alveolar ATP production increased . Intra - alveolar microinfusion of the puri - nergic receptor antagonist , PPADS , and the nucleotide hydrolyzing enzyme , apyrase , each completely blocked the Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt and NO responses in EC . Lung expansion induced Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations in mice lacking the P2Y1 , but not the P2Y2 , purinergic receptors , which were located in the perivascular interstitium basolateral to AEC . Prolonged lung expansion instituted by mechanical ventilation at high tidal volume increased EC expression of nitrotyrosine , indicating development of nitrosative stress in lung microvessels . These ﬁndings reveal a novel mechanism in which mechanically induced purinergic signaling couples cross - compartmental Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations to micro - vascular NO production . pulmonary circulation ; calcium ; DAF ; imaging ; ﬂuorescence BECAUSE OF ITS VAST ENDOTHELIAL ( EC ) surface area , the lung is a major producer of EC nitric oxide ( NO ) ( 6 ) . However , although the molecular mechanisms of EC - derived NO pro - duction are well understood ( reviewed in Ref . 18 ) , the mech - anisms by which the lung triggers EC NO production remain unknown . Here , we consider the possibility that the trigger mechanism might be determined by lung mechanics . Thus lung expansion , as during a sigh , or during high - tidal volume mechanical ventilation , might induce vectorial signaling from alveoli to capillaries to initiate EC NO production consequent to alveolar stretch . Our ﬁndings in intact alveoli indicate that lung expansion , even if held brieﬂy for a few seconds , increases cytosolic Ca 2 (cid:1) ( Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt ) oscillations in alveolar epithelial cells ( AEC ) ( 2 ) . Studies in cultured AEC indicate that cell stretch releases ATP ( 1 , 10 , 15 , 20 ) . Hence , we considered the possibility that these mechanisms might be linked in EC NO production . Thus , ATP could induce vectorial signaling by ligating purinergic recep - tors of the P2Y and the P2X families that include eight isoforms each ( Y1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 11 – 14 ; X 1 – 7 and X M ) ( 1 , 3 ) . P2Y receptors induce Ca 2 (cid:1) signaling through inositol triphosphate ( IP3 ) - mediated endoplasmic reticular Ca 2 (cid:1) release , while P2X receptors are Ca 2 (cid:1) channels . Although P2Y and P2X receptors are expressed in pulmonary vascular and airway epithelial cells ( reviewed in Ref . 1 ) , direct evidence for alveolar expression is scant ( reviewed in Ref . 23 ) . Hence , no understanding exists as to whether this receptor group plays a role in EC NO produc - tion . We considered these issues in the context of real - time ﬂuorescence imaging of the lung that provides a unique ap - proach for deﬁning cross - compartmental signaling mecha - nisms between alveoli and juxta - alveolar microvessels ( 13 ) . We report below that lung expansion sets up P2Y2 - driven Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations that in turn induce NO production in juxta - alveolar capillaries . Thus , we show for the ﬁrst time that in lung , a purinergic mechanism translates the mechanical effects of alveolar expansion to induction of microvascular NO production . METHODS Fluorescent dyes and reagents . Fura 2 - AM and 4 - amino - 5 - methyl - amino - 2 (cid:2) , 7 (cid:2) - diﬂuoroﬂuorescein ( DAF - FM diacetate ) were purchased from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) .

Alexa Fluor 546 F ( ab (cid:2) ) 2 fragment of goat anti - rabbit IgG was purchased from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA ) . Lung preparation . All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of St . Luke’s - Roosevelt Hospital Center . Using our reported methods ( 2 ) , lungs were isolated from Sprague - Dawley rats ( anesthetized with 3 . 5 % halothane inhala - tion and 35 mg / kg intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium ) , and blood was perfused ( 14 ml / min ) at 37°C .

The P2Y1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) and P2Y2 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) mice were kindly provided by Dr . B . H . Koller ( Univ . of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Chapel Hill , NC ) . Fluorescent probes and drugs given to the perfusate consisted of 4 % dextran and 1 % BSA dissolved in HEPES buffer at hematocrit of 20 % . Real - time lung imaging . Juxta - alveolar capillaries were viewed with a charge - coupled device camera ( Photometrics ) and an epiﬂuorescence microscope ( Nikon (cid:4) 40 water - immersion objective , Nikon , Japan ) . A two - photon microscope ( Radiance 2100 MP ; Zeiss , Melville , NY ; (cid:4) 40 water - immersion objective , Nikon ; Chameleon laser ; Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) was used for localization of P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors . During imaging , we infused the capillaries with buffer to establish blood - free conditions . Capillary ﬂuorescence was quantiﬁed using image analysis software ( Metaﬂuor ; Molecular Devices , Down - ington , PA ) . Ca 2 (cid:1) and NO imaging . Ca 2 (cid:1) imaging and analysis methods have been reported ( 11 ) . For epithelial and endothelial Ca 2 (cid:1) determina - tions , fura 2 - AM ( 10 (cid:5) M ) was given for 30 min by intra - alveolar or intracapillary infusion , respectively . Alveoli and capillaries loaded with fura 2 were excited at 340 nm and 380 nm , and Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt was determined from the computer - generated 340 : 380 ratio based on a K d of 224 nmol / l and appropriate calibration parameters ( 11 , 12 ) . NO production was detected by EC ﬂuorescence following a 20 - min intracapillary infusion of DAF - FM diacetate ( 10 (cid:5) M ; excitation at 490 nm ) . Background levels were determined in capillaries not loaded with ﬂuorescent dyes . Imaged gray levels are reported after back - ground subtraction . Indirect immunoﬂuorescence in situ . To determine endothelial nitrotyrosine formation , anti - nitrotyrosine antibody ( 10 (cid:5) g / ml ) was infused into capillaries for 10 min , and then secondary Alexa 546 MAb ( 1 : 200 ) was infused for 10 min . Unbound ﬂuorescence was removed by perfusing the capillaries with HEPES for 5 min . For abluminal staining of ECs , we permeabilized microvessels by infusion of 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10 and 4 min , respectively . We then infused the capillaries with rabbit anti - rat P2Y1 or P2Y2 antibody ( 8 (cid:5) g / ml ) followed by infusion of Alexa 546 ( 1 : 200 ) , and HEPES for washing . For determination of abluminal localization of the P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors , EC nuclei were stained by capillary infusion of Hoechst 33342 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) followed by a wash . Experimental procedures . Palv was elevated by increasing airﬂow through the airway cannula ( 2 ) . We gave intra - alveolar injections by alveolar micropuncture according to our reported methods ( 8 , 21 ) . Each microinfusion was given for 10 min to ﬁll seven to ten alveoli . The micropunctured alveolus was excluded from the imaged ﬁeld . Agents given by alveolar microinfusion were : ATP ( 100 (cid:5) M ) , the ATP inhibitor apyrase ( 50 U / ml ) , and the purinergic receptor antag - onist PPADS ( 100 (cid:5) M ) . Agents given through the venous microcath - eter included ATP ( 100 (cid:5) M ) , UTP ( 100 (cid:5) M ) , PPADS ( 100 (cid:5) M ) , the speciﬁc P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS2179 ( 100 (cid:5) M ) , t - BHQ ( 10 (cid:5) M ) , and L - NAME ( 250 (cid:5) M ) . These agents were each given for 10 min . For some infusions , PLA was varied as stated . Ca 2 (cid:1) - free con - ditions were established by infusion of Ca 2 (cid:1) - free HEPES solution containing 4 % dextran , 1 % FBS , and EGTA ( 0 . 5 mmol / l ) . ATP assay in alveolar microlavage . An assay that generates NADPH in the presence of ATP was used ( 5 ) . The assay is based on the reduction of NADP to ﬂuorescent NADPH by glucose - 6 - phos - phate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) in the presence of glucose and ATP . For alveolar microlavage , we introduced two micropipettes in two neigh - boring alveoli . Through one micropipette we infused buffer contain - ing glucose ( 10 mM ) , NADP ( 5 mM ) , hexokinase , and G6PD ( 8 U / ml each ) . After 2 min of infusion , we collected (cid:6) 0 . 5 (cid:5) l of the infused solution through the second micropipette . We determined ATP con - tent in the collected sample by quantifying NADPH ﬂuorescence ( excitation 340 nm ; emission 430 nm ) in the micropipette tip , which we viewed by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( IX 81 ; Olympus America , Melville , NY ) . In the inhibitor group , alveoli were pretreated with apyrase ( 50 U / ml ) . Statistics . All data are represented as means (cid:7) SE . Statistical data analysis was performed using SigmaStat ( Systat Software , San Jose , CA ) . Comparisons between the groups were tested using ANOVA on ranks by the Dunn method . Repeated measurements were tested using the Mann - Whitney Rank Sum Test . Statistical signiﬁcance was ac - cepted at P (cid:8) 0 . 05 . RESULTS Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt responses . As shown in the images in Fig . 1 , A and D , a 15 - s lung expansion caused by an increase of Palv from 5 to 15 cmH 2 O induced marked increases in the amplitude of Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations in both AEC of the intact alveolus and EC of juxta - alveolar capillaries . The tracings show that although the AEC oscillations were larger than the EC oscillations , in each case the mean Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt remained unchanged ( Fig . 1 , C and E ) . To determine whether these Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt responses resulted from alveolar ATP release , we assayed ATP content in terms of NADPH ﬂuorescence in alveolar washes collected by mi - crolavage as described in METHODS . A 15 - s lung expansion markedly increased lavage ATP ( Fig . 1 F ) . Pretreating alveoli with the nucleotide hydrolyzer apyrase blocked the increase of NADPH ﬂuorescence in the microlavage ( Fig . 1 G ) . Apyrase did not affect the control ﬂuorescence , indicating that under baseline conditions the ﬂuorescence did not reﬂect ATP con - tent . These ﬁndings afﬁrmed that lung expansion induced alveolar ATP release . With Palv held at the baseline level of 5 cmH 2 O , intra - alveolar ATP injections replicated the lung expansion - induced Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations in both AEC and EC ( Fig . 1 , H and I ) . Pretreatment with intra - alveolar apyrase blocked both expan - sion - and ATP - induced responses in AEC and EC ( Fig . 1 , H and I ) , whereas similar pretreatment with the purinergic recep - tor antagonist PPADS blocked the inﬂation - and ATP - induced EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt responses ( Fig . 1 I ) . Furthermore , the lung expan - sion - induced response was blocked by t - BHQ , the inhibitor of Ca 2 (cid:1) release from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) ( Fig . 1 I ) . The inhibitors given alone were without effect ( data not shown ) . Together , these ﬁndings suggested that the AEC and EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations resulted from ligation of an alveolar purinergic receptor . Receptor type . To deﬁne receptor expression , we permeabil - ized EC membranes by capillary microinfusions of Triton X - 100 . Then , we sequentially microinfused a nuclear - staining dye ( Hoechst 33342 ) , a primary MAb against the P2Y1 or the P2Y2 receptor , and a ﬂuorescent secondary IgG directed against the primary MAb . Finally , we removed unbound ﬂuo - rescence from the vessel lumen by buffer infusion and imaged the alveolo - capillary region by two - photon microscopy . As exempliﬁed by the images in Fig . 2 , A and B , P2Y2 distribution was evident on both the luminal and interstitial aspects of AEC , but only on the interstitial aspect of EC . By contrast , P2Y1 expression was not detectable ( not shown ) . These ﬁnd - ings suggest that EC of lung capillaries speciﬁcally expressed P2Y2 . Since the receptors were expressed abluminally on EC , for a blood - borne ligand to access the receptors , the transcapillary liquid ﬂow would have to be in the direction of microvascular ﬁltration , namely outward from the vascular lumen . We pre - viously established that outward ﬁltration occurs at left atrial L902 ENDOTHELIAL NITRIC OXIDE PRODUCTION IN LUNG AJP - Lung Cell Mol Physiol • VOL 296 • JUNE 2009 • www . ajplung . org b y 10 . 220 . 33 . 2 on J une 1 9 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j p l ung . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m pressure ( P LA ) of 8 cmH 2 O , whereas at P LA of 3 cmH 2 O transcapillary ﬂow is in the opposite direction ( 24 ) . Accord - ingly , intracapillary ATP injections at P LA of 8 cmH 2 O dou - bled the Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillation amplitude in EC , although injec - tions at P LA of 3 cmH 2 O were without effect ( Fig . 2 C ) . At P LA of 8 cmH 2 O , intracapillary injection of PPADS inhibited the lung expansion - induced increase of the EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscilla - tions ( Fig . 2 C ) , but not the AEC oscillations ( not shown ) . These Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt data supported the morphological evidence that P2Y2 expression is strategically located between the basolat - eral regions of AEC and EC such that following inﬂation , nucleotides released basolaterally by AEC might ligate inter - stitial purinergic receptors . To determine the purinergic receptor type responsible for the present EC responses , we gave intracapillary infusions of several ligands at P LA of 8 cmH 2 O ( Fig . 3 A ) . The P2Y2 agonist UTP increased Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillation amplitude in EC . However , an equimolar infusion of the P2Y1 agonist 2 MeSATP failed to induce EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt responses . Furthermore , the P2Y1 inhibitor MRS2179 failed to block the ATP - and UTP - induced EC Ca 2 (cid:1) responses ( shown for UTP only ) . Infusion of MRS2179 alone was without effect . Since these ﬁndings suggested the involvement of P2Y2 receptors , we determined inﬂation - induced responses in mice lacking P2Y1 [ P2Y1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) ] or P2Y2 [ P2Y2 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) ] receptors . As similar to rat lungs , inﬂation - induced increases in Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations occurred in both AEC and EC of WT and P2Y1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) mice . However , the oscillations were completely absent in P2Y2 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) mice ( Fig . 3 B ) . Hence , ligation of P2Y2 receptors was speciﬁcally responsible for the inﬂation - induced EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt responses . NO . Since increase of EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt increases EC NO , we imaged capillary ﬂuorescence of the NO - detecting intracel - lular dye DAF in capillaries perfused with RBC - free buffer ( Fig . 4 A ) and conﬁrmed that the NO donor SNAP increased the ﬂuorescence ( Fig . 4 B ) . At baseline Palv , no signiﬁcant changes in DAF ﬂuorescence occurred in 20 min ( Fig . 4 D ) , indicating that basal NO production was below our detection limit . However , as shown by the image ( Fig . 4 C ) , the tracing ( Fig . 4 D ) and the group data ( Fig . 4 E ) , following a 15 - s lung expansion , DAF ﬂuorescence increased linearly for more than 30 min at a rate that was markedly higher than baseline . This response was completely blocked by pretreating the capillaries with the NOS inhibitor L - NAME , by intra - alveolar PPADS and by capillary infusion of t - BHQ in Ca 2 (cid:1) - free buffer ( Fig . 4 E ) , but not by infusion of Ca 2 (cid:1) - free buffer alone ( not shown ) . These ﬁndings indicate that lung expansion - induced EC NO production occurred secondary to intra - alveolar ligation of alveolar purinergic receptors followed by ER Ca 2 (cid:1) release in EC . To determine the extent to which lung expansion - induced EC NO production caused EC stress , we determined the presence of nitrotyrosine in venular capillaries by means of in situ immunoﬂuorescence . We mechanically ventilated lungs at high tidal volume ( HV ) for 20 min by cycling Palv at inspira - tory and expiratory pressures of 20 and 5 cmH 2 O ( 12 cycles / min ) . As shown by the images ( Fig . 5 , A – E ) and the group data ( Fig . 5 F ) , ventilation caused an increase of nitrotyrosine stain - ing on the EC luminal surface . This increase was blocked by preinjecting intra - alveolar PPADS , or intracapillary L - NAME , or intracapillary PEG - catalase . Buffer injections given by the intra - alveolar or intra - capillary routes were without effect . These ﬁndings indicate that in HV , alveolar purinergic receptor ligation led to EC NO production , hence nitrotyrosine forma - tion on the EC membrane . DISCUSSION We show here that lung mechanics plays a critical role in NO production from the lung’s vascular bed . A single lung expansion held for 15 s augmented Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations not only in the alveolus , as previously reported from our group ( 2 ) , but also in juxta - alveolar capillaries . These responses were ATP induced as indicated by several key results , namely , ﬁrst , the AEC and EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations could not be induced in mice lacking the P2Y2 receptor . Second , intra - alveolar injec - tions of the ATP inhibitor apyrase and the purinergic receptor antagonist PPADS each inhibited both sets of Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscil - lations . Third , lung expansion caused alveolar ATP release , as detected in microlavages sampled directly from the alveolus . Fourth , intra - alveolar injection of ATP elicited Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscil - lations similar to those resulting from lung expansion . To - gether , these ﬁndings are the ﬁrst evidence that the mechanical effects of lung expansion induce fast , ATP - dependent alveolo - capillary communication of Ca 2 (cid:1) signals . An important consequence of this communication was NO production in juxta - alveolar microvessels , as determined by DAF ﬂuorescence . Nitrosylation of DAF by NO forms a highly ﬂuorescent benzotriazole ( 12 ) . DAF imaging allows quantiﬁ - cation of nanomolar NO , providing a highly sensitive approach for NO detection ( 27 ) . Since the ﬂuorophore is retained in the cell , cellular NO production results in a progressive increase of DAF ﬂuorescence . A 15 - s lung expansion induced a steady increase of EC DAF ﬂuorescence for up to 40 min , correspond - ing to the duration for which the increases in AEC and EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations were maintained . These ﬁndings indicate that a major effect of the lung expansion was to increase capillary NO production . Importantly , the effect was inhibited by infusion of t - BHQ in Ca 2 (cid:1) - free buffer , implicating ER Ca 2 (cid:1) release in the NO increase . Since ER Ca 2 (cid:1) release determines Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations , we interpret that the induced Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations were responsible for the EC NO increase . Direct evidence by real - time lung imaging as in the present studies , in our previous reports ( 9 , 19 ) , and by the Kuebler group ( 11 , 28 ) , indicates that lung capillaries constitutively produce low levels of NO under nonstressed conditions . Al - though multiple reports implicate capacitative Ca 2 (cid:1) entry ( CCE ) in EC NO production , CCE associates with lung stresses such as pulmonary edema ( 14 ) and is therefore un - likely to underlie nonstressed lung microvascular NO produc - tion . Here , enhancement of EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations enhanced EC NO production , and the durations of these two responses matched . Further , the NO increase occurred under external Ca 2 (cid:1) - free conditions . These ﬁndings rule out a causal role for CCE in the present NO responses . We suggest that for the relatively low levels of NO that are produced in lung capillaries during unstressed conditions , constitutive EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscilla - tions ( 14 , 29 ) might provide a sufﬁcient stimulus both at baseline as well as during lung inﬂation . The main function of the capillary NO might be to inhibit platelet aggregation , hence hemostasis in lung vessels ( 7 ) .

For example , if apyrase or PPADS leaked across the alveolar wall , the agents might have inhibited the induced Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations by directly blocking EC purinergic receptors . However , this possibility may be ruled out since intra - alveolar apyrase or PPADS did not inhibit the increase of EC Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations induced by intra - capillary infusion of ATP at P LA of 8 cmH 2 O , indicating absence of alveolar leak . Moreover , we conﬁrmed our previous ﬁndings ( data not shown ) that following intra - alveolar microinjection , agents such as fura 2 are retained in the alveolar compartment and do not passively leak across to capillaries ( 13 ) , such that the fura 2 ﬂuorescence is exclusively alveolar . Circulating blood cells may be excluded as a source of NO because the imaged capillaries were perfused with cell - free HEPES buffer instead of blood . Constant EC ﬂuorescence intensities at baseline and following L - NAME showed that photo bleaching did not take place under our experimental conditions . Previous reports suggest that increase of DAF ﬂuorescence can also be obtained by superoxide anions ( O 2 (cid:1) (cid:3) ) or by peroxynitrite formed by the reaction of NO with O 2 (cid:1) (cid:3) .

Inhibition of the communicated Ca 2 (cid:1) responses in P2Y2 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) mice , but not P2Y1 ( (cid:3) / (cid:3) ) mice , indicated that the P2Y2 receptor was critical for this signaling . Consistent with this conclusion was the immunoﬂuorescence evidence for the Fig . 5 . Endothelial nitrotyrosine expression .

The somewhat patchy and nonuniform ﬂuores - cence distributions in ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) suggest that the membrane permeabilization procedures might have caused receptor loss . Morphological characterization by ultra - struc - tural analyses might better resolve the basolateral localization of the receptor . However , in support were the ligational responses to vascular injections of P2Y2 ligands that were evoked only at vascular pressures that caused ligand ﬂux across the capil - lary wall to basolateral sites . Our detection of ATP in the alveolar microlavage following lung expansion conﬁrms that the nucleotide was apically secreted by AEC . However , it is unlikely that apically secreted ATP was transported across the restrictive alveolar epithelial barrier . Since AEC might secrete ATP basolaterally , as shown for airway epi - thelial cells ( 4 ) , it appears that the location of P2Y2 receptor at the EC basolateral aspect appropriately places the recep - tor on the vectorial route of Ca 2 (cid:1) communication between and alveoli and capillaries . Our ATP assay in micropipette collections of the alveolar microlavage provides a new approach for analyzing ﬂuid recovered directly from the pulmonary acinus . The advantage is that acinar collections lack contaminations from the upper airway as might be the case for conventional bronchoalveolar lavage . Since micropuncture does not cause alveolar leaks , as we have shown previously ( 13 ) , the acinar collections are not contaminated by liquid from the extra - alveolar interstitium . Given that acinar volume in the rat is (cid:6) 2 (cid:5) l ( 25 ) and that each micropipette collection was (cid:6) 0 . 5 (cid:5) l , we conclude that the collections were obtained entirely from a single acinus . The cellular source of the present ATP secretion remains undetermined . Cultured A549 cells and airway epithelial cells secrete ATP in response to cell distortion induced by hypotonic exposure , or cyclic compression ( 4 , 26 ) . In a study of live alveoli by confocal microscopy , we determined that the bulk of the alveolar distortion during lung expansion occurs in type 1 , and not type 2 , epithelial cells ( 21 ) . It is possible therefore that here , type 1 cells were the primary acinar sources of exogenous ATP . Further understanding is required as to whether loss of alveolar elastic recoil in elastin - degrading diseases increases type 1 cell stretch , thereby increasing ATP secretion . Thus our ﬁndings reveal a novel role for extracellular ATP , namely as an alveolo - capillary signal transmitter that is acti - vated by lung mechanical distortion . Thus , in addition to being a secretagogue in the lung parenchyma ( 17 , 20 ) , ATP might be relevant to alveolo - capillary function under normal and stressed conditions . As we show here , an important conse - quence of this ATP - based communication is an increase in EC NO production , an effect that might explain the regional vasodilatation that follows lung expansion ( 16 ) . However , in high - tidal volume mechanical ventilation ( HV ) , the NO effects might be deleterious . Our ﬁndings support this possibility since HV increased nitrotyrosine formation in capillaries , indicating development of nitrosative stress . Hence , since HV induces lung ATP secretion ( 22 ) , the associated lung injury might be due to nitrosative stress caused by increased NO formation . In conclusion , our ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst direct evidence that EC NO production following lung expansion is regulated by alveolar nucleotide release , which induces vectorial alveolo - cap - illary signaling through cascades of Ca 2 (cid:1) cyt oscillations in AEC and EC . To the extent that this signaling induces vascular nitro - sative stress , alveolar ATP secretion might be an appropriate therapeutic target for prevention of ventilator - induced ALI .
