Scholarly and Research Communication volume 6 / issue 4 / 2015 2 Introduction As highlighted in other places ( Chuk , Hoetzlein , Kim , & Panko , 2012 ; Hunter , 2014 ; Quan - Haase , Suarez , & Brown , 2014 ) , humanists are participating in collaborations and research networks with others in the academy and beyond to explore increasingly complex research questions with technologically oriented methodologies and resources . Participating individuals welcome these endeavours to undertake projects that would not be otherwise possible and to provide access to advice , mentoring , technology , knowledge , and funds ( Hayat & Mo , 2014 ; Lungeanu & Contractor , 2014 ; Philbin , 2008 ) . Although these projects have clear beneﬁts for all those involved , these collaborations are not without their challenges . Oen coming from a multiplicity of disciplines , perspectives , and objectives , the partners must ﬁnd ways to navigate their inherent cultural diﬀerences , which range from ways of working to reward structures and beyond ( Dimitrova , Mok , & Wellman , 2014 ; Lind , Styhre , & Aaboen , 2013 ) . To date , though starting to change , such partnerships tend to be more common on the science side of campus ( Philbin , 2008 ; Quan - Haase et al . , 2014 ) . Research on these science - oriented partnerships and networks suggests several factors that lead to success . ese include generating trust and commitment to the collaboration , a foundation oen created through previous projects ; learning to speak the same language ; creating common frames of reference with clear research outcomes , responsibilities , and reporting systems ; ensuring ongoing communication through emails and face - to - face meetings ; having a willingness to share information and knowledge ; and ﬁnally aligning mutually beneﬁcial goals and objectives . For many projects , a “collaboration agent , ” whose responsibility is the partnership and its outcomes and who works to coordinate activities and engagement between participants , can be necessary for eﬀective results . From the perspective of academics , the ability to publish results remains paramount , regardless of others’ interest in this activity ( Barnes , Pashby , & Gibbons , 2002 ; Hayat & Mo , 2014 ; Philbin , 2008 ; Plewa & Quester , 2007 ; Quan - Haase et al . , 2014 ; une , 2007 ) . Finally , these partnerships support graduate student training in skills desired by the private sector , including communication , collaboration , ﬂexibility , and the ability to work across organizations and intellectual communities of practice ( Bilodeau , 2007 ; Carr , 2012 ; Maioni , 2015 ; une , 2010 ) . Despite increased calls for partnerships and networks , there are few examples of successful ones involving the humanities . ree notable exceptions are the Graphics , Animation and New Media ( GRAND ) Network of Centres of Excellence ( Dimitrova et al . , 2014 ) ; the Hispanic Baroque Project ( Quan - Haase et al . , 2014 ) ; and the University of California’s Transliteracies Project ( Chuk et al . , 2012 ) . Because of the paucity of successful humanities networks , little is understood about the ways that they might work within the humanities and the range of beneﬁts that they can provide to members . To this end , this article will examine the experiences of Implementing New Knowledge Environments ( INKE ) , a large - scale collaboration working with academic and non - academic partners that has been in existence for several years , and provide some insight into best practices for networked scholarship ( Quan - Haase et al . , 2014 ) . It also builds on earlier papers about INKE and collaboration ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2012a , 2012b , 2012e , 2013b , 2014 ) . Case study Funded through Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council’s Major Collaborative Research Initiative granting program ( SSHRC , 2010 ) , the INKE research project is a seven - year , multidisciplinary project with 35 active researchers plus postdoctoral fellows , graduate research assistants , and partner organizations across four countries , and with a budget of approximately $ 13 million in cash and in - kind funding ( INKE , 2012b ) . is seven - year project is focused on studying “diﬀerent elements of reading and texts , both digital and printed [ , ] ” and contributing “to the development of new digital information / knowledge environments” ( R . G . Siemens , Warwick , Cunningham , Dobson , Galey , Ruecker , Schreibman , & INKE Research Group , 2009 ; SSHRC , 2009 , 2010 ) . Originally structured into four sub - research areas , the team is now divided into two sub - research areas , with a focus on Modeling and Prototyping ( MP ) and Interface Design ( ID ) . ( For a discussion on reasons for reorganization , see L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2012a ; L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2012d ) . ) In the fourth year of funded research , INKE also underwent a mid - term review in which those involved reported on its research outcomes relative to the grant application , initial project planning , and ongoing yearly plans . Beyond reading the report , the review panel interviewed the administrative team , researchers , partners , and past and present graduate research assistants and postdoctoral fellows to understand research outcomes and collaboration and administrative processes . Ultimately , this review determined whether INKE’s research funding should continue for the remaining half of the grant application . Based on its demonstrated productivity and collaboration , the project was renewed . Now in its sixth year of funded research , the team is considering future research directions and partnerships with a focus on digital knowledge production within Canada ( INKE , 2014b ) . Methodology Members of the administrative team , researchers , graduate research assistants , and others are asked about their experiences collaborating within INKE on an annual basis in order to understand the nature of collaboration and ways that it may change over a grant’s long - term life . e interview questions focus on understanding the nature of collaboration and its associated advantages and challenges within INKE’s context . ese interviews allow the researcher to explore topics more fully and deeply with probing and follow - up questions while participants reﬂect on their own experiences and emphasize those issues that are important to them ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2012b , 2012c ) . is article focuses on interviews that are centred on the project’s ﬁh year . Data analysis involves a grounded theory approach that focuses on the themes that emerge from the data . is analysis is broken into several steps . First , the data is organized , read , and coded to determine categories , themes , and patterns . ese categories are tested for emergent and alternative understandings , both within a single interview and across all interviews . is is an iterative process , involving movement between the data , codes , and concepts , constantly comparing the data to itself and the developing themes ( Marshall & Rossman , 1999 ; McCracken , 1988 ; Newell & Swan , 2000 ; Rubin & Rubin , 1995 ) . 3 Scholarly and Research Communication volume 6 / issue 2 / 2015 Siemens , Lynne . ( 2015 ) . “INKE - cubating” Research Networks , Projects , and Partnerships : Reﬂections on INKE’s Fih Year . Scholarly and Research Communication , 6 ( 4 ) : 040198 , 11 pp . Findings e ﬁndings focus on beneﬁts , challenges , and partner relationships . C OLLABORATION BENEFITS Overall , INKE continues to be a positive experience with clear advantages for the interviewed team members . Of note , these individuals viewed INKE as a supportive collaborative space . As expressed by a researcher ( R1 ) , 1 one beneﬁt is the ability to talk and work very directly with peers on research . is is in contrast to their work with postdoctoral fellows and student research assistants , with whom a supervisory relationship exists . Others suggested that INKE provides an opportunity to pool intellectual resources and skills ( R4 ) and a space where one could keep learning ( AL3 ) . INKE has also been successful in building networks and relationships that allow team members to collaborate and pursue research beyond this particular project’s mandate . One interviewee ( AL2 ) suggested that INKE is functioning like an incubator that fosters networks and partnerships that in turn enable other research , an impact that cannot be easily seen or measured . e interviewees also referenced INKE’s working culture , particularly as it relates to work patterns and accountability structures . As one researcher ( R1 ) noted , in contrast to a single researcher’s ability to let their own research “go dormant” for a period of time , team members in a large - scale research project such as this one do not have the same luxury . Here , given the annual planning and reporting cycles , the project has its own momentum that keeps the work moving forward , regardless of other work demands on team members ( R1 ) . Again , in contrast to research performed by a single individual , another researcher ( R2 ) highlighted that INKE projects require multiple skill sets and a willingness to not be in control , especially in those cases where one might not understand the technology , methodology , and / or soware being used by others within the project . Finally , participating in this scale of collaboration requires a level of personal responsibility to track one’s own contributions to the research and interactions with others ( R4 ) . At the same time , interviewees acknowledged that this type and scale of organization and planning could be an adjustment for those who are not accustomed to it ( R2 ) . Given this , another researcher ( R4 ) recognized that it could be challenging for someone to join INKE at this point in its life cycle because of the well - established culture . In response , a third interviewee ( R3 ) highlighted the need and importance of learning about and understanding INKE’s culture , by observing and participating in meetings and reading governance documents , in order to work eﬀectively within the collaboration . To this end , the governance documents have been necessary to ensure that everyone is “on the same page” ( AL3 ) . Still , one interviewee ( R4 ) acknowledged there are many moving parts in INKE with no “authoritative” record of roles , tasks , outcomes , and relationships , though the updated website , mid - term report , governance documents , and articles have been beneﬁcial . Finally , in terms of INKE’s collaborative patterns , even aer ﬁve years of working together with a level of familiarity that is created through ongoing interactions , face - to - face meetings continue to be important venues for discussions about research and 4 Scholarly and Research Communication volume 6 / issue 4 / 2015 Siemens , Lynne . ( 2015 ) . “INKE - cubating” Research Networks , Projects , and Partnerships : Reﬂections on INKE’s Fih Year . Scholarly and Research Communication , 6 ( 4 ) : 040198 , 11 pp . planning for the next stages . ese encounters provide a diﬀerent type of engagement around the research than is possible through document exchange and online collaborative writing spaces ( R1 ) . Another researcher ( R3 ) commented that regular meetings between researchers and sub - area research teams remain key for accessing the knowledge and expertise needed for projects . e interviewed graduate research assistants ( GRAs ) and postdoctoral fellows remain very positive about their experiences within INKE . One ( GRA1 ) realized that their involvement in this project is a “unique experience , ” not available to all graduate students . ey further articulated that their work in INKE is contributing to their own research , intellectual development , and professionalization through interactions with other team members , conference presentations , and exposure to the larger academic context . Others ( GRA2 , PDF1 ) echoed this by acknowledging the beneﬁts associated with meeting various people within the larger digital humanities ﬁeld and being exposed to diﬀerent skills and perspectives . ese individuals also advised graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who might become involved in similar collaborations to take advantage of opportunities to present , to meet and talk with people at conferences , and to publish . Finally , they also recommended ﬁnding that “space that lets you do things” where one has interest and capacity within the project’s objectives and research focus ( PDF1 ) . e researchers themselves also recognized the opportunities presented to postdoctoral fellows and students within INKE to gain important collaborative , project management , and other professional skills ( AL2 ) . However , they realized that they themselves are still learning how to be supervisors and mentors to these individuals ( AL3 ) and experimenting with diﬀerent models to ensure that work is completed as required . As one last point , those at smaller institutions continued to have diﬃculty in ﬁnding students to hire who have the necessary skills ( R3 , AL3 ) . O NGOING AND NEW CHALLENGES At the same time as interviewees articulated the beneﬁts of INKE , they identiﬁed both ongoing and new challenges . In terms of perennial issues , the annual distribution of funds in a timely manner remains a consistent challenge , as identiﬁed by several individuals ( R1 , AL2 , AL3 ) . Because it is not always clear when the funds will arrive , researchers oen cannot hire research assistants until funds are in place at their institutions , thus potentially stalling work plans . Secondly , participation in INKE is always balanced against research , teaching , and other obligations , meaning that there were times when researchers were less able to participate fully in this project . One researcher ( R1 ) noted that they felt they might miss important information if they could not attend a meeting due to other commitments . And , as highlighted by an administrative lead ( AL3 ) , these meetings are acknowledged to be very important to keeping everyone informed of research activity . Given everyone’s level of commitment to INKE and other projects , it was sometimes diﬃcult for researchers to get what they needed from others in a timely manner . As a result , good working relationships were very important . As one researcher expressed , they did not want to “feel bad when they have to ask for something” ( R4 ) . 5 Scholarly and Research Communication volume 6 / issue 2 / 2015 Siemens , Lynne . ( 2015 ) . “INKE - cubating” Research Networks , Projects , and Partnerships : Reﬂections on INKE’s Fih Year . Scholarly and Research Communication , 6 ( 4 ) : 040198 , 11 pp . Finally , several interviewees highlighted the challenges associated with working at a distance from team members , a situation that is in contrast to a lab setting where collaborators are co - located ( R3 ) . is reality can make it diﬃcult to manage relationships among team members and resolve issues when face - to - face meetings cannot be easily held ( AL2 ) . Working at a distance also presents ongoing challenges of coordination and communication between the two sub - research area groups and their projects ( AL3 ) . As for new challenges , several interviewees identiﬁed the issues associated with academic credit and authorship conventions and implications for students and early career scholars in collaboration . Self - identiﬁed as an early career scholar , one researcher ( R3 ) highlighted the need for balance between the monograph , oen required for tenure and promotion in the humanities , and collaborative , multi - author digital humanities work . ey also suggested that support from administrators was important as well as clarity for the ways multi - authorship outputs would be counted for advancement . is was echoed by another researcher ( R2 ) , who highlighted that students still need to undertake solo work in order to build their curriculum vitae , a step required by many disciplines within the humanities . is tension also extended to institutions that may not “buy into” the multiple author / collaborative model and conferences that may drop multiple authors from the program . is reality reinforces the need to be named the ﬁrst author in order to get recognition ( AL2 ) . Consequently , one researcher ( R3 ) advised students to talk with their supervisor to ensure that they understand the ways that academic credit will be allocated within collaborative projects . An administrative leader ( AL2 ) echoed this with a caution to students who are considering whether to bring their own research into a team setting such as INKE . E XPERIENCES WITH ACADEMIC AND NON - ACADEMIC PARTNERS Drawing from their experiences , interviewees highlighted several advantages to partner involvement within INKE . First , one administrative lead ( AL3 ) remarked that partners brought alternative viewpoints even when doing similar things . Further , others observed that a partner’s ﬁnancial contribution could allow resources to go further while smoothing cash ﬂows . e participants also described the diﬀerent levels and types of partner involvement . For example , several partners are embedded directly in the research , planning , and reporting structures and co - fund several graduate research assistant and postdoctoral fellow positions . As one of these types of partners noted ( R1 ) , they have two roles , both researcher and partner , and can provide a “positive synergy . ” A second type of partner is one who assists with translating research results , prototypes , and models to a non - research setting with non - academic outputs . Articles and conference papers may not follow from this work , which may be a drawback for those who need publication ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2014 ) . Further , these partners’ involvement tends to vary in timing and eﬀort because the particular project may not be part of their key business activities ( AL3 ) . While INKE’s experience with partners is still in development , the interviewees reﬂected on several lessons that might inform next steps . First , their comments 6 Scholarly and Research Communication volume 6 / issue 4 / 2015 Siemens , Lynne . ( 2015 ) . “INKE - cubating” Research Networks , Projects , and Partnerships : Reﬂections on INKE’s Fih Year . Scholarly and Research Communication , 6 ( 4 ) : 040198 , 11 pp . suggested that existing relations , trust , and commitment with a partner developed through other activities are important as a foundation for a successful collaboration , which can in turn be supported in part by a liaison person . Further , researchers must be aware that partners may work on a project intensively in cycles . As a result , this context must be incorporated into the grant and subsequent work plans . To ﬁnd interested partners , researchers must present at conferences beyond academia and use language that ﬁts potential partners’ focus and the type of curiosity that they may bring to the research . Discussion As discussed in the reﬂection on this collaboration’s fourth year ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2014 ) , INKE is now a mature and productive team project as measured by presentations , publications , prototypes , gatherings , student training , and other factors ( INKE , 2012c , 2013a , 2013b ) . Further , the project is acting as an “incubator , ” facilitating relationships and networks that extend research beyond this project’s speciﬁc scope . Finally , while acknowledging ongoing challenges , team members remain positive about the collaborative experience and are looking forward to future research projects both within INKE and beyond with a possible new grant application . e graduate research assistants and postdoctoral fellows are especially positive given the opportunity to develop new skills and knowledge in this and other INKE - related projects . As a mature collaboration , INKE has a clear working culture articulated both explicitly through its governance documents and planning and reporting processes ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2012c ) and implicitly through conduct in formal and informal meetings , emails , conference calls , and work patterns ( Lawrence , 2006 ; Lingard , Schryer , Spaﬀord , & Campbell , 2007 ) . is culture has allowed the project to be highly productive . While newcomers to INKE may not always understand these patterns , as highlighted by the interviewees , this culture ensures that the overall research can continue even when individual researchers’ time commitment ebbs and ﬂows . An inherent trade - oﬀ exists between individual research , where a researcher is in control of all aspects of the project , and the team’s focus , where that individual may not understand all parts of the research and methodologies . As a result , collaborators must trust each other and possess a willingness to “not be in control” ( R2 ) as well as ﬁnd ways to incorporate individual research interests into the larger INKE mandate ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2014 ) . Spiller , Ball , Daniel , Dibb , Meadows , and Canhoto ( 2014 ) describe collaboration within a research context as a process of “letting go” of the individual’s focus and then a “coming together” of the team . ey also introduce the idea of “researcher plasticity , ” where individuals must adapt to a team’s way of working together , particularly in those cases where it might diﬀer from one’s own preferred working style . is observation echoes the need for ﬂexibility , willingness to share information and knowledge , and readiness for collaboration ( Bracken & Oughton , 2006 ; Hayat & Mo , 2014 ; Olson & Olson , 2000 ) . It is important to recognize that a wide variety of partners , contributions , and engagement will be involved within a large project such as INKE . As is the present case with the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory , the Modernist Versioning Project , 7 Scholarly and Research Communication volume 6 / issue 2 / 2015 Siemens , Lynne . ( 2015 ) . “INKE - cubating” Research Networks , Projects , and Partnerships : Reﬂections on INKE’s Fih Year . Scholarly and Research Communication , 6 ( 4 ) : 040198 , 11 pp . and others ( INKE , 2014a ) , some partners will be involved in the research itself while others , like the University of Alberta , 2 will be more involved in knowledge mobilization , translation , and production activities . Finally , other partners may only consult and / or provide technical infrastructure , data , new research contexts , and other resources ( INKE , 2014b ) . Ultimately , mutual interest and beneﬁt for both researchers and partners must be found . However , several points of tension between researchers and partners may be present . First , the collaboration must ﬁnd a balance between the researchers’ intellectual curiosity and desire for academic papers and the oen more “practical” production orientation of industry partners . Further , the work ﬂows of industry and other non - academic partners will vary from those of researchers . e engagement between the two will likely be cyclical , and this will need to be taken into consideration in project timeframes . As INKE has found with interactions between researchers , graduate research assistants , postdoctoral fellows , sub - research groups , and partners over the life of the project thus far ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2012a , 2012b , 2012e , 2013b , 2014 ) , ongoing and regular communication is important for exchanging ideas , building trust , and establishing mutual agreed - upon collaboration processes , plus evaluating interest and commitment to working together on projects within the larger grant objectives . e annual partner gatherings are one way this can occur ( INKE , 2014c , 2014d ) , with further , ongoing communication through the project website and online collaborative spaces ( INKE , 2012a , 2014b ) . is reﬂects the experience of the Hispanic Baroque Project , GRAND , and other successful networks ( Dimitrova , Mok , & Wellman , 2014 ; Hayat & Mo , 2014 ; Quan - Haase et al . , 2014 ) . As INKE reﬂects on its past while looking forward to new research directions , the team has identiﬁed many issues that present challenges to large - scale academic collaborations distributed across distance , disciplines , stages of academic career , institutions , and other factors . Although no easy answers exist for some of these issues , such as distribution of funds in a timely fashion ( Cummings & Kiesler , 2005 ) , disciplinary practices around authorship conventions , and acceptability of multiple authors ( Choi & Pak , 2007 ; Kraut & Galegher , 1990 ; L . Siemens , Smith , & Liu , 2014 ) , just knowing about potential problems is “half the battle” and ensures that the team discusses these in advance , drawing upon established and successful processes for managing these issues and others that may be encountered in future projects ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2013a , 2013b , 2014 ; L . Siemens , Siemens , Cunningham , Dobson , Galey , Ruecker , & Warwick , 2009 ) . Finally , to date , INKE has developed well - established working patterns and relationships that have been beneﬁcial to the collaboration as a whole , the individual collaborator , and partners alike . is presents challenges for the team as it nears the completion of this project and contemplates next steps in the research . As explored in earlier papers ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2012a , 2012b , 2012e , 2013b , 2014 ) , what of the present articulation of culture and processes will be carried forward to the proposed next project ? And what does this mean for new partners and their 8 Scholarly and Research Communication volume 6 / issue 4 / 2015 Siemens , Lynne . ( 2015 ) . “INKE - cubating” Research Networks , Projects , and Partnerships : Reﬂections on INKE’s Fih Year . Scholarly and Research Communication , 6 ( 4 ) : 040198 , 11 pp . incorporation into the established relationships , a process that can be time - consuming and full of potential confusion , as INKE participants have already found ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2013b ) ? Or will new working patterns , governance documents , planning and reporting processes , and / or authorship convention be negotiated to reﬂect deeper engagement of partners who may not want to participate in academic papers and presentations ? And how will the research reﬂect partners’ needs , interests , and their particular contexts and realities ? As INKE has found , the opportunity to meet face - to - face in formal meetings and informal interactions will be key to establishing next directions ( L . Siemens & INKE Research Group , 2013b ) .
