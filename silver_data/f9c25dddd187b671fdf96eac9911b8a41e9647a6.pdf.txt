Timothy Kassis * Departmentof BiologicalEngineering , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , Massachusetts , United States of America * tkassis @ mit . edu Abstract Authorship of peer - reviewed journal articles and abstracts has become the primary currency and reward unit in academia . Such a reward is crucial for students and postdocs who are often under - compensated and thus highly value authorship as an incentive . While numerous scientific and publishing organizations have written guidelines for determining author qualifi - cations and author order , there remains much ambiguity when it comes to how these criteria are weighed by research faculty . Here , we sought to provide some initial insight on how fac - ulty view the relative importance of 11 criteria for scientific authorship . We distributed an online survey to 564 biomedical engineering , biology , and bioengineering faculty members at 10 research institutions across the United States . The response rate was approximately 18 % , resulting in a final sample of 102 respondents . Results revealed an agreement on some criteria , such as time spent conducting experiments , but there was a lack of agree - ment regarding the role of funding procurement . This study provides quantitative assess - ments of how faculty members in the biosciences evaluate authorship criteria . We discuss the implications of these findings for researchers , especially new graduate students , to help navigate the discrepancy between official policies for authorship and the contributions that faculty truly value . Introduction Authorship of peer - reviewed journal articles and conference abstracts is one of the primary currencies in the academic reward system and has become a core metric for assessing intellec - tual productivity and output [ 1 ] . Thus , determining who receives authorship and ranking in the authorship list is necessary for responsible science . In particular scientific disciplines , such as mathematics or physics , for example , authors are listed in alphabetical order [ 2 ] . In the bio - sciences , however , there is a heavy emphasis on rank in the authorship list , and author order is thought to correspond to the significance of one’s contribution [ 3 – 6 ] . The last author is typi - cally the senior author and is the principal investigator overseeing the lab , while the first author is the researcher , such as the student , postdoc or research scientist that led the project and car - ried out the majority of the experimental work and manuscript preparation . Unfortunately , the authorship list is highly politicized [ 7 – 12 ] , abused .

Data Availability Statement : All relevantdata are withinthe paper and its Supporting Information files . Funding : The authorreceived no specific funding for this work . Competinginterests : The authorhas declared that no competinginterests exist . the first author is usually not very difficult , but issues arise when there are multiple people involved in a study with various levels and types of contributions [ 13 , 14 ] . A recent survey showed that almost two - thirds of authors do not entirely agree with their defined contribution as indicated on journal submission disclosure forms [ 15 ] . New graduate students and research - ers joining research laboratories are often unclear of the criteria that their immediate supervi - sors value in determining authorship [ 16 ] . Junior researchers as well as their supervisors both benefit when the factors involved in authorship assignment are understood by both parties and the scientific community makes its expectations clear . Numerous universities , including Stanford [ 17 ] , Georgia Tech [ 18 ] , and Harvard University [ 19 ] have made efforts to write internal guidelines defining authorship . The majority of scien - tific and engineering - based organizations have also proposed guidelines describing what con - stitutes an author and the type of contribution required [ 20 ] . And while some attempts have been made to implement these guidelines practically within the health and biosciences [ 21 ] , the criteria remain ambiguous and do not reflect which are most valued in determining authorship and rank . Biomedical journals mostly refer to guidelines set forth by the Interna - tional Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( ICMJE ) [ 22 ] . ICMJE recommends that an author meet the following four criteria : 1 . Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work ; or the acquisition , analy - sis , or interpretation of data for the work ; AND 2 . Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content ; AND 3 . Final approval of the version to be published ; AND 4 . Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are investigated and resolved . Although these guidelines help define author inclusion , they are not of particular help when deciding authorship order [ 23 ] . In most cases , the principal investigator of a research group is the final arbiter in determining authorship inclusion and order . In this study , we aim to break down these criteria further to elucidate how faculty in the biosciences weigh them in determin - ing both inclusion as an author and authorship order . We do not attempt to assess these crite - ria from an ethical perspective , but rather seek to provide empirical data that will improve new researchers’ understanding of faculty expectations within a research project and to bring these criteria to the attention of the community in order to reassess them in light of the ethics of jus - tice and fairness for author attribution [ 9 , 11 , 24 – 28 ] . Materials and methods There are many types of contributions in any collaborative research study . While there is no clear consensus on how to classify these contributions , we devised 11 explicit criteria based on prior literature [ 29 ] and our subjective assessment of what factors we thought the biosciences community would deem important for both determining one’s recognition as an author and their rank on the authorship list . The 11 criteria are : 1 . Total time spent on a project : This refers to the total amount of time devoted to the research study , including conducting literature searches , planning experiments , performing experi - ments , analyzing data , writing and proofreading the manuscript . 2 . Time spent carrying out background research and literature review : This refers to intellec - tual efforts put into initially deciding on a certain research area and reviewing the literature see what has been previously accomplished in the field . How faculty in the biosciencesevaluateauthorship criteria PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0183632 August 22 , 2017 2 / 10 3 . Contribution to hypothesis and idea generation : This refers to the hypothesis upon which a study is grounded in hypothesis - driven research , or the idea for non - hypothesis - driven research such as methodologies , tools , and exploratory studies . 4 . The contribution of a special reagent , material , or computer code : This refers to unique material - based contributions , like a particular genetically modified cell strain , a synthesized molecule or computer code for analysis or processing . 5 . The extent of involvement in obtaining research funding : This refers to the process of fund - raising—through writing grant proposals to funding agencies or industry collaborators . 6 . Time spent doing experiments : This refers to the total time conducting the experiments , whether they are simulations as part of a computational project or lab time spent culturing cells or working with animals . 7 . The uniqueness of experimental skills and techniques : This refers to laboratory - based skills that are unique and require considerable prior knowledge or experience . For example , cer - tain rodent surgical skills may take a very long time to acquire and perfect . Other skills , such as changing cell media , would not fit into this category . 8 . Time spent analyzing data : This refers to taking raw data , compiling it , analyzing it , per - forming statistical analysis and presenting it in visual or textual formats . 9 . Contribution to written manuscript : This refers to creating an outline , assembling any fig - ures , and drafting the manuscript . 10 . The quality of written contribution to the manuscript : This refers to how some individuals are more efficient at writing than others , so it is difficult to assess written contributions without also evaluating the quality of one’s writing . Writing quality includes being able to explain research findings well , and employ good grammar and spelling , good structure , and flow . 11 . Time spent editing and proofreading manuscript : This refers to the final step before submission to a journal when the lead author sends the manuscript to all the listed authors for final commenting , editing , and proofreading . To assess the value that research faculty assign to each of these criteria , an online survey was emailed to research faculty in biology , biomedical engineering , and bioengineering at 10 research institutions ( Table 1 ) . The institutions were chosen to represent a wide geographical Table 1 . Institutions and departments the survey was sent to .

Given the interdisciplinary nature of biological research , we decided to lump three different departments together . These departments were biology , biomedical , and bioengineering , noting that bio - medical and bioengineering departments are considered the same . The survey was individually addressed and emailed to 564 total faculty members , and we received 102 responses for a total response rate of 18 . 1 % . Faculty members were identified by their listings on their department’s website . Eligible faculty were those who provided an email address on their university depart - mental page . No other criterion for sample selection was used . No follow - up reminders were sent , nor were other optimization strategies used for the purpose of this study [ 30 ] . The survey was designed to be straightforward and easy to fill out to maximize the response rate . For each criterion , the respondent had to indicate , on a scale of 1 – 10 , how important they thought the criterion was , with one being the least important and ten being the most important . Specifi - cally , we asked : “On a scale of 1 – 10 , how important are the following factors in determining authorship and authorship rank on a peer - reviewed journal paper ? ( Please note this only applies to life sci - ences / biosciences / biomedical engineering ) . ” Only the main title of each criterion listed above in bold was provided to the survey respon - dents . The descriptions listed under each criterion are strictly for clarification purposes for the readers of this manuscript . Survey results are provided as a . csv supplemental file ( S1 File ) . Statistical analysis A D’Agostino & Pearson omnibus normality test was conducted , and only three of the 11 crite - ria were normally distributed . Thus in our results , we focus on the median , the 25 th and 75 th quartiles for data reporting as they are more appropriate for skewed , non - normal distribu - tions . We also use the coefficient of variation as a metric to explain the dispersion in the response histograms . All graphing and analysis was carried out using Graphpad Prism 6 . Results and discussion Many criteria are used to assess authorship . We found the time spent performing experiments had the highest overall median importance score as assessed by our faculty respondents . The intellectual contribution of the hypothesis ( for hypothesis - driven research ) or coming up with a study idea had the second highest score . The very act of contributing a reagent , material or computer code—even when it is unique to the person contributing it—tied for least important with the extent of one’s involvement in obtaining funding . Overall , there seemed to be some agreement that the time spent conducting experiments , coming up with a hypothesis , analyz - ing data , and writing the manuscript were the four most important criteria for both determin - ing one’s authorship status and rank ( Fig 1A ) . The total time spent on a project was assessed as being important , but 19 . 6 % of the respondents selected a neutral score of 5 indicating that , by itself , time spent on a project should not necessarily factor into authorship , which might reflect the fact that time alone does not translate to productivity . The median value was 7 / 10 , and this criterion ranked fifth of all contributions ( Fig 1B ) . The scores did not follow a normal distribution , so we calculated the coefficient of variation ( CV ) as the main metric for quantifying spread instead of the standard deviation ( Fig 2 ) . While all criteria had a CV greater than 23 % , two criteria stood out as having a very high CV . The first , with the highest CV of 57 % , was the extent of involvement in obtaining funding , How faculty in the biosciencesevaluateauthorship criteria PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0183632 August 22 , 2017 4 / 10 while the second highest CV with 53 % was the contribution of a material . The four criteria with the highest median scores ( Fig 1A ) also had the lowest CV values . Fig 3 presents histograms of the responses describing four criteria that revolve around preparing for the study . These include background research , hypothesis generation , the con - tribution of various material goods , and obtaining funding . We found that almost 23 % of respondents had a neutral opinion of the value of background research , such that this alone did constitute direct involvement with the study . The median was 5 / 10 ( Fig 3A ) . There was a clear agreement regarding the importance of generating a hypothesis or idea with the majority of faculty who weighted this criterion strongly with a median of 8 / 10 and the majority giving it a 10 / 10 score ( Fig 3B ) . The contribution of a special reagent , material , or computer code did not constitute grounds for authorship , with almost 23 % of faculty giving it a 2 / 10 score with a median of 4 / 10 ( Fig 3C ) . An issue of great controversy in academia is whether involvement in obtaining funding , such as writing a grant proposal , justifies authorship . Although the median was 4 , there was no clear consensus on the importance of this criterion as indicated by both the low median ( Fig 3D ) and high CV ( Fig 2 ) . The next two criteria involved experimental aspects of the project . These included time spent performing experiments as well as any required skill or technique . We found that respondents highly value the time put into performing experiments with a median score of 8 / 10 , and almost 22 % of faculty scored it as 10 / 10 ( Fig 4A ) . Some experiments require special Fig 1 . A ranking of the relative importance of 11 authorship criteria . A ) Rankingof variouscriteria accordingto research faculty in the biomedical sciences .

B ) Total time spent has a high weight , but the majority of faculty do not appearto hold a strong opinionabout this as reflected by the 19 . 6 % of respondentsgiving it a score of 5 , probablydue to the fact that time spent does not necessary equate with an intellectual contribution to the study .

These can include surgical tech - niques , specific cell handling procedures , and skills that would typically require a lot of experi - ence to adequately master or which cannot easily be replaced .

The median was 6 / 10 ( Fig 4B ) , but the scores had a high CV of 43 % . Last but not least , we evaluated the four criteria that corresponded with the post - experi - mental stage of a research study . These included data analysis , writing the manuscript , actual quality of the manuscript content contribution , and editing / proofreading of the manuscript . Both analyzing data and writing the manuscript were considered very important by the respondents , both of which had a median of 8 / 10 ( Fig 5A and 5B ) . Almost 25 % of respondents agreed that the quality of the written content is important and gave it an 8 / 10 score , but there was significant variation in responses , resulting in a median of 6 / 10 ( Fig 5C ) . The final step of the paper submission , which involves final edits and proofreading , had a median of 5 / 10 , again indicating that most respondents do not necessarily have a strong opinion about this criterion ( Fig 5D ) . As scientific studies become more interdisciplinary and collaborative in nature , authorship lists have grown . Here , we attempted to clarify how faculty in the biosciences value various aca - demic contributions . We hope that these results remove some of the ambiguity surrounding this important issue and provide some insight for new graduate students and researchers . We believe that the data presented here will serve three main goals ; 1 ) provide authorship decision makers ( such as the first and senior author ) in bioscience research , information that will let them see how their own judgments about criteria for authorship attribution compare to others Fig 5 .

While our study provides some quantifiable evidence on the attitudes held by faculty at research institutions , it is bounded by several limi - tations . The choice of criteria is a very difficult issue . While there have been previous attempts [ 31 – 34 ] , criteria are usually hard to define and their relative importance is a subjective matter [ 32 ] . The segmentation and wording chosen for the criteria in this pilot study should be more carefully assessed in future more thorough studies with an emphasis on separating time com - mitted to the work from the quality of that work . Furthermore , some research projects may not involve all 11 criteria , so if a certain criterion was ranked low , it could be that it just does not exist within certain types of research , and hence faculty respondents working in that research area might have scored it low or given it a neutral score . This may account for some of the high CV values apparent in the results . One way to address this would be to define these criteria specifically for certain sub - disciplines within the biosciences and to quantify survey results based on discipline instead of departments which are highly interdisciplinary in nature . It is also important to mention that due to the small sample size , the scores here may not be representative of all faculty in the biosciences community , and a much more comprehensive study is necessary to arrive at generalizable conclusions . Additionally , since no survey remind - ers or follow - up was conducted after the initial email , it is likely that there was a higher likeli - hood of selection bias for faculty with a greater tendency to have certain opinions . The survey was also sent to all email accessible faculty members in the same departments , so there was the potential for them to discuss questions before returning the survey . While we believe the find - ings presented here illuminate good initial results , they merely provide a basis for much more comprehensive and systematic surveys that should be conducted . Conclusions While the data gained through this survey is limited in scope , such information helps advance a standardized method for assessing authorship inclusion and rank on the authorship list and begins to understand how members of the biosciences community faculty evaluate various cri - teria . We hope that in the future , objective methodology can standardize authorship across research laboratories and identify where author contributions can be better defined and tracked . In this small study , we provided some initial quantifiable insight to help early re - searchers and the biosciences community as a whole , but more work by individual researchers , organizations , and publishers is needed to arrive at generalizable and clearly communicated criteria for determining publication authorship and rank .
