Quantitative Imaging ( QI ) mode® atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) was used to measure the heights of the leading - edge cell peripheries , the lamellipodia , of two such cell lines ( SNB - 19 and UP - 007 ) , together with those from non - neoplastic astrocyte control cells ( CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 ) and from a low - grade ( WHO grade I ) glioma cell line ( SEBTA - 048 ) . The lamellipodia heights of the glioma cells SNB - 19 and UP - 007 were 2 . 45 ± 0 . 59 and 1 . 57 ± 0 . 42 µm , respectively , which were higher than those of the CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 cells ( 1 . 03 ± 0 . 58 and 0 . 85 ± 0 . 40 µm , respectively ; p < 0 . 0001 , except between CC - 2565 and UP - 007 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Lamellipodia height differences between the two glioma cell lines ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , might be attributed to the measured difference in invasive potential between these two cell lines . The equivalent lamellipodia height of the SEBTA - 048 cells was 1 . 16 ± 0 . 48 µm , the same as that of the astrocytes ( p > 0 . 05 ) , but lower than those of the high - grade gliomas ( p < 0 . 0001 and p < 0 . 01 for SNB - 19 and UP - 007 , respectively ) . These measured heights , therefore , may provide new insights for monitoring and controlling cellular invasion in brain tumours . Keywords : Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , brain tumour , invasion , cytoskeleton , lamellipodia , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . 1 . Introduction Glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) is a heterogeneous and highly invasive WHO grade IV [ 1 ] brain tumour that leads to a poor prognosis for patients ( median survival 14 . 2 months , 2 - year survival 26 % , with surgery and radiotherapy with concomitant or adjuvant chemotherapy ) [ 2 ] . The use of atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) nanoindentation measurements to study stiffness of cancer cells has received much attention [ 3 - 6 ] . We recently investigated the expression of cytoskeletal proteins and cellular stiffness of glioma cells ( SNB - 19 ) , with and without siRNA knock down CD44 , a cell adhesion molecule ( CAM ) long associated with gliomas [ 7 ] , and also compared these to non - neoplastic astrocytes ( CC - 2565 , control ) [ 8 ] . Silencing CD44 SNB - 19 led to changes in cytoskeletal protein expression , making them less migratory , and AFM showed a reduction in Young’s Modulus ( E = 0 . 56 BioNanoScience First online : 06 January 2016 , pp . 1 - 7 , doi : 10 . 1007 / s12668 - 015 - 0188 - 3 www . link . springer . com / article / 10 . 1007 / s / 12668 - 015 - 3 2 ± 0 . 50 kPa , nuclear regions ) relative to the parental cells ( E = 1 . 93 ± 2 . 86 kPa ; p < 0 . 001 ) . We hypothesised that CD44 signalling via cytoskeletal proteins such as vimentin may influence the ability of glioma cells to respond to host - tumour derived mechanical pressures . In this paper , we report on the surprisingly large heights along portions of the cell periphery leading edge , the lamellipodia [ 9 ] , of GBM cells from two cell lines , SNB - 19 and UP - 007 . Lamellipodia are Arp2 / 3 complex - dependent , sheet - like membrane protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells that contain a dense network of branched actin filaments [ 10 , 11 ] . For comparisons , we have also examined the peripheries of cells from a low - grade , WHO grade I [ 1 ] , dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour ( DNET ) glioma cell line ( SEBTA - 048 ) and from two non - neoplastic astrocyte cell lines ( CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 ) . Here , we hypothesise that the heightened features of the lamellipodia might provide a new indicator of cellular invasion . In a recent paper , ‘dynasore’ , a dynamin inhibitor , was found to suppress lamellipodia formation and invasion of U2OS human osteosarcoma cells [ 12 ] . Thus , the lamellipodia might provide an attractive target to monitor and control cellular invasion and migration in brain tumours . We have used AFM Quantitative Imaging ( QI ) mode® ( JPK Instruments ) , a fast force mapping technique [ 13 ] , to image the cells . This technique allows the height at which the tip , measured from each approach force curve ( an array of curves constitutes each map ) , just makes contact with the sample ( set - point = 0 nN ) . These data were subsequently used to produce contact point ( ‘zero force’ ) topography images . It was thought that this technique would lead to significantly less compression of delicate lamellipodia structures than with standard Tapping Mode AFM imaging . Light microscopy , including live cell imaging , and an invasion assay were used as supporting techniques . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 Cell culture Non - neoplastic foetal cerebral astrocytes ( CC - 2565 ) , passage - 5 , ( Lonza , UK ) and human normal astrocytes ( SC - 1800 ) , passage - 6 , derived from the cerebral cortex ( ScienCell , USA ) were grown in astrocytes basal media ( AGM ) ( Lonza , Germany ) supplemented with SingleQuots ( Lonza , Germany ) and 3 % human serum ( Sigma , UK ) . The established human glioblastoma cell line , SNB - 19 ( passage - 44 ) , was obtained from the DSMZ German Brain Tumour Bank ( Germany ) . Human glioblastoma cell line , UP - 007 ( passage - 12 ) and low grade glioma ( WHO grade I ) cell line SEBTA - 048 ( right temporal lobe ; passage - 4 ) were established in - house from biopsy - derived cultures . All glioma cells were cultured in Dulbecco ` s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM ; Fisher , UK ) supplemented with 10 % human serum ( Sigma , UK ) and maintained at 5 % CO 2 and humidified atmosphere at 37 °C . All cell lines were subjected to routine mycoplasma testing utilising a kit from Lonza . Cell authentication was conducted using a microfluidic electrophoresis system incorporating an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , USA ) , to analyse STR - PCR fragments from 10 human genomic loci of human cell lines [ 14 ] . 2 . 2 Live cell imaging microscopy and phase contrast microscopy Cells of interest were plated at 30 % confluency in a 24 - well plate and left to adhere overnight prior to each live cell experiment . Live cell imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M ( inverted ) microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Welwyn Garden City , Herts , UK ) contained in an incubator ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 , humid atmosphere ) . A 40  objective was used and phase images were consecutively acquired typically at 5 frames s - 1 for 60 s ( Volocity software V 6 . 1 . 1 , Perkin Elmer , Waltham , MA , US ) . Phase images were BioNanoScience First online : 06 January 2016 , pp . 1 - 7 , doi : 10 . 1007 / s12668 - 015 - 0188 - 3 www . link . springer . com / article / 10 . 1007 / s / 12668 - 015 - 3 3 subsequently extracted from live cell movie sequences . Lower magnification phase contrast images ( 20  objective ) were also acquired using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope ( Shinjuku , Tokyo , Japan ) ; contrast and brightness were adjusted slightly in MicroSoft PowerPoint . 2 . 3 Invasion Cell invasion was assessed by the Transwell TM - modified Boyden chamber technique [ 7 ] . Briefly , the Transwell TM inserts used were 8 µm porosity , polycarbonate membrane filters contained within 24 - well plates ( Corning , UK ) and were coated with BD Matrigel TM ( 50 µl , 0 . 5 mg / ml ; Scientific Laboratory Supplies , Nottingham , UK ) . Platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF AB ; 10 ng / ml ) was used as a chemoattractant in the lower compartment . Invasion was allowed to occur for 6 h in an incubator ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) . A time - point analysis ( 2 h , 4 h , 6 h , 8 h , 10 h , 12 h ) was carried out before choosing ‘6 h’ as the optimal incubation time for the invasion assay , which was further supported by previous studies [ 15 ] . This provided enough time for SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cells to invade prior to proliferation based on the population doubling times calculated for these cell lines . The filters were then removed and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) . Non - invading cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed and invaded cells , adherent on the lower filter surface , were characterised through alkaline phosphatase vector red ( Vectorlabs , UK ) staining . Cells positive for CD44 were thus stained red . Nuclei were blue counterstained with Haematoxylin ( Dako , UK ) . Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiophot brightfield microscope using the AxioVision software ( V4 . 4 , Carl Zeiss ) with a 20× objective . Cells were counted in 5 random fields , with each experiment being performed in triplicate . 2 . 4 AFM AFM measurements were performed using a NanoWizard 3 AFM ( JPK Instruments , Berlin , Germany ) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M ( Carl Zeiss ) inverted optical microscope placed on a Halcyonics Micro 40 anti - vibration table ( Accurion , Goettingen , Germany ) . JPK AFM image analysis software ( V 5 . 1 . 13 ) was used for image acquisition and analysis . The serum growth media from a Petri dish ( glass - bottomed ) of cells of interest was removed ( pipette ) and replaced with ‘imaging buffer’ ( DMEM / F - 12 nutrient mixture ( Ham ) ( 1 : 1 ) ( 1X ) ; Gibco , Life Technologies , Paisley , UK ) . The Petri dish ( lid removed ) was then placed on an integrated Petri dish heater ( 37 °C ; JPK Instruments ) and a 20  objective , on the inverted microscope , was used to locate cells of interest . An ‘arrow - shaped’ Si cantilever ( HQ : CSC37 / No Al ; probe ‘C’ , nominal length l nom = 300 ± 5 µm , width w nom = 35 ± 3 µm , thickness t nom = 2 . 0 ± 0 . 5 µm , spring constant k nom = 0 . 4 N m - 1 ; Mikromasch Europe , Wetzlar , Germany ) with integrated tip ( R = 8 nm , h = 12 – 18 µm ) was used for all measurements . The actual k value was measured as 0 . 2180 N m - 1 prior to imaging using the method of Hutter and Bechhoefer [ 16 ] and obtaining a force vs . distance curve on the bottom of the glass Petri dish ( in media ) in a region devoid of cells . AFM QI mode® images ( 64  64 arrays of force - distance curves ) of located cells were obtained ( approach and retract , z length = 5 . 0  m , approach = retract velocity 250  m s - 1 , approach = retract time = 20 ms ; image acquisition time = 2 . 88 min , set - point = 6 . 0 nN ) over a scan range of 100  m  100  m . AFM contact point images , representing cell topographies in the near - absence of an applied load ( 0 nN ) from the tip / cantilever , were extracted from the approach force curves comprising the QI mode® images . Height data of cell lamellipodia were extracted from transects drawn across the contact point images ( n = 10 per cell , 3 or 4 cells per cell line ; mean and sd per cell lines were reported ) . Combined height values , per cell line , were analysed using a one - way ANOVA , with a Tukey post - hoc test ( * , p < 0 . 05 ; * * , p < 0 . 01 ; * * * , p < 0 . 001 ; * * * * , p < 0 . 0001 ) in SPSS ( Version 22 ; IBM , NY , US ) . Contact point images were filtered using a median pass filter .

Results and discussion 3 . 1 Live cell imaging Prior to the AFM studies , an overview of the cellular morphology and presence of lamellipodia were investigated . Lamellipodia were present at the leading edge of a number of migrating cells , as confirmed by live cell imaging ( those of UP - 007 cells are shown in Fig . 1 ) . These structures could be seen as bright - shaded , ruffled edges on generally semi - circular protruded regions . Fig . 1 .

Lamellipodia could be observed at the leading edge of a number of these cells . SC - 1800 cells at 60 % confluence showed a polygonal morphology with thin , elongated BioNanoScience First online : 06 January 2016 , pp . 1 - 7 , doi : 10 . 1007 / s12668 - 015 - 0188 - 3 www . link . springer . com / article / 10 . 1007 / s / 12668 - 015 - 3 5 intercommunicating processes at either end of the cells ( Fig . 2b ) . Lamellipodia of similar appearance to those of the CC - 2565 cells were observed . SNB - 19 cells , at 30 % confluence , showed small , predominantly stellate morphologies , with some flattened , irregular shapes with tiny , slender processes ( Fig . 3a ) . This cell line had the greatest number of lamellipodia , possibly indicative of higher motility and / or invasion [ 12 ] . UP - 007 cells , at 40 % confluence , revealed their heterogeneous nature , with many processes at their ends and with some short , more rounded morphologies with predominantly fusiform cells ( Fig . 3b ) . Similar lamellipodia structures were observed , although to a much reduced frequently compared to their SNB - 19 counterparts . The low - grade SEBTA - 048 cell line , at 70 % confluence , showed rather fat , end - feet processes ; again , lamellipodia of similar appearance to those seen above were present ( Fig . 4 ) .

Scale bar = 20 µm . 3 . 3 Invasion To investigate whether the difference in number of lamellipodia observed in SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cells might be indicative of their invasive potential , an invasion assay was performed . The findings showed more SNB - 19 cells positive for CD44 ( red ) had invaded to the lower side of the membrane compared to UP - 007 ( Fig . 5 ) . SNB - 19 cells showed a homogenous morphology with shorter fat processes . These results were reflected in the quantitative analysis , showing SNB - 19 cells to be more invasive than those of UP - 007 ( p < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 6 ) . BioNanoScience First online : 06 January 2016 , pp . 1 - 7 , doi : 10 . 1007 / s12668 - 015 - 0188 - 3 www . link . springer . com / article / 10 . 1007 / s / 12668 - 015 - 3 7 Fig . 5 .

The graph is representative of the results obtained by repeating the study three times in triplicate ; number of SNB - 19 cells invaded = 140 , number of UP - 007 cells invaded = 100 . 3 . 4 AFM measurements Cells for AFM imaging were selected , using the inverted microscope , with the following criteria : that they were not joined to other cells , they exhibited lamellipodia and were free from obvious artefacts . Phase contrast images were obtained for each cell imaged , although are not shown . AFM contact point images of non - neoplastic astrocyte cell lines ( CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 ; Fig . 7 ) generally revealed rounded cells , with raised nuclei regions but with little or no apparent lamellipodia despite these features being present in the phase contrast images . Transects drawn across the cells , enabled the lamellipodia heights to be calculated ( Fig . 8 shows an example ) . The combined values for CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 cell lines were 1 . 03 ± 0 . 58 and 0 . 85 ± 0 . 40 µm , respectively . In contrast , many of the glioma cells , from both SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cell lines , had obvious lamellipodia structures present in the AFM contact point images ; they were particularly prominent in the SNB - 19 cells ( Fig . 9 ) . The lamellipodia heights were 2 . 45 ± 0 . 59 and 1 . 57 ± 0 . 42 µm , respectively . These heights were also measured for low grade glioma cells ( SEBTA - 048 ) to investigate whether they decreased in magnitude ( Fig . 10 ) . The lamellipodia heights here were 1 . 16 ± 0 . 48 µm , more comparable to the astrocytes .

AFM contact point images extracted from QI mode® images of low - grade ( WHO grade I ) glioma cells . A statistical comparison of the lamellipodia heights for the different cell lines is summarised in Fig . 11 . The two astrocyte cell lines showed no difference in periphery cell heights ( p > 0 . 05 ) and had the lowest values . The lamellipodia heights in SNB - 19 and UP - 007 cells were both greater than those of the astrocytes ( p < 0 . 0001 , except between CC - 2565 and UP - 007 , p < 0 . 001 ) . These results suggest that some elaborate concentration of cytoskeletal structures , probably F - actin , may explain the large height values of the lamellipodia . Interestingly , a difference in lamellipodia heights were noted between the two types of gliomblastoma cell lines ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , possibly reflecting the degree of invasive potential between these two cells lines as evidenced in the invasion assay . The low - grade glioma cell line had lamellipodia heights similar to the astrocytes ( both cell types ; p > 0 . 05 ) , although were less than those of the gliomas ( p < 0 . 0001 and p < 0 . 01 for SNB - 19 and UP - 007 , respectively ) . The low - grade SEBTA - 048 cells would be expected to be less invasive than the WHO grade IV gliomas , although this was not investigated . Fig . 11 . Lamellipodia heights measured from AFM contact point images of the various cell lines ; CC - 2565 and SC - 1800 ( 3 cells per cell line ) , SNB - 19 , UP - 007 and SEBTA - 048 ( 4 cells per cell line ) ; 10 measurements per cell ; * , p < 0 . 05 ; * * , p < 0 . 01 ; * * * , p < 0 . 001 ; * * * * , p < 0 . 0001 ; red = non - neoplastic astrocytes , blue = glioblastoma high - grade ( WHO grade IV ) , green = low - grade ( WHO grade I ) glioma cell line . To our knowledge , these are the first AFM images that show a heightened edge at cell peripheries . Numerous AFM studies show cell topography to slope away from the nucleus gradually to the cell margin and do not report the raised topography at cell edges , both for glioma cells [ 17 - 20 ] and other cells ( cancerous and non - cancerous ) [ 21 - 23 ] . Staining BioNanoScience First online : 06 January 2016 , pp . 1 - 7 , doi : 10 . 1007 / s12668 - 015 - 0188 - 3 www . link . springer . com / article / 10 . 1007 / s / 12668 - 015 - 3 11 of F - actin , intermediate filament and microtubules in these cells show fluorescence at the cell periphery , but also throughout the cytoplasm [ 7 ] ( although largely around the nuclear regions , in the case of vimentin [ 8 ] . Therefore , some elaborate concentration of cytoskeletal structures , possibly F - actin , may explain the large height values of the lamellipodia . The size of the heightened lamellipodia in high - grade glioma cells over astrocytes and low - grade glioma cells may provide new insights into controlling cellular invasion . 4 . Conclusions For the first time , AFM has been used to measure the lamellipodia heights of high - grade glioma cells and these have been found to be higher than non - neoplastic astrocyte control cells . Equivalent heights of low - grade glioma cells were found to be identical to those of the astrocytes and less than those of the GBMs , although future studies should incorporate more low - grade glioma cell lines . These results suggest that lamellipodia height could be used to monitor and control cell invasion in brain tumours .
