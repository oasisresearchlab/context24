Taken together , these data emphasize the importance of the PLC η 2 EF - hand domain and articulation of PLC η 2 with LIMK - 1 in regulating neuritogenesis . Keywords Calcium signaling · Cell differentiation · Electron microscopy · Neuritogenesis · Protein – protein interaction Introduction Phospholipase C ( PLC ) enzymes are a well - characterized family of hydrolytic enzymes ( E . C . 3 . 1 . 4 . 11 ) . In mam - mals , PLC enzymes are responsible for cleaving the mem - brane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) , thereby generating the two essential sec - ond messengers inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) and 1 , 2 - diacylglycerol ( DAG ) following receptor activa - tion . Consequently , Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 triggers calcium discharge from the endoplasmic reticulum and DAG together with calcium activates effector proteins , most notably protein kinase C ( PKC ; Berridge et al . 1983 ; Hokin and Hokin 1953 ; Streb et al . 1983 ) . Six classes of PLCs have been identified based on their amino acid sequence , domain structure , and mechanism of activation . These include the β , γ , δ , ε , ζ and η classes ( Suh et al . 2008 ) . The most recently identified is the η class of which there are two iso - forms , PLC η 1 and PLC η 2 ( Hwang et al . 2005 ; Nakahara et al . 2005 ; Stewart et al . 2005 ; Zhou et al . 2005 ) , encoded by the PLCH1 and PLCH2 genes , respectively . A number of spliceforms of both PLC η 1 and PLC η 2 exist , which vary in length at the C - terminal end ( Hwang et al . 2005 ; Zhou et al . 2005 ) . This region is rich in serine and proline residues , and it is thought that this part of the protein may Abstract Neurite growth is central to the formation and differentiation of functional neurons , and recently , an essential role for phospholipase C - η 2 ( PLC η 2 ) in neuri - togenesis was revealed . Here we investigate the function of PLC η 2 in neuritogenesis using Neuro2A cells , which upon stimulation with retinoic acid differentiate and form neurites . We first investigated the role of the PLC η 2 cal - cium - binding EF - hand domain , a domain that is known to be required for PLC η 2 activation . To do this , we quantified neurite outgrowth in Neuro2A cells , stably overexpress - ing wild - type PLC η 2 and D256A ( EF - hand ) and H460Q ( active site ) PLC η 2 mutants . Retinoic acid - induced neu - ritogenesis was highly dependent on PLC η 2 activity , with the H460Q mutant exhibiting a strong dominant - negative effect . Expression of the D256A mutant had little effect on neurite growth relative to the control , suggesting that cal - cium - directed activation of PLC η 2 is not essential to this process . We next investigated which cellular compartments contain endogenous PLC η 2 by comparing immunoelectron microscopy signals over control and knockdown cell lines . When signals were analyzed to reveal specific labeling for PLC η 2 , it was found to be localized predominantly over the nucleus and cytosol . Furthermore in these compartments ( and also in growing neurites ) , a proximity ligand assay * Alan J .

Both PLC η enzymes can be activated directly by mobili - zation of intracellular calcium ( Kim et al . 2011 ; Popovics et al . 2011 , 2014 ) . We recently reported that mutation of a putative calcium - binding residue ( D256A ) within EF - loop 1 of the EF - hand domain of PLC η 2 reduces the sensitivity to calcium by tenfold , indicating this domain to be respon - sible for calcium - induced activation ( Popovics et al . 2014 ) . In addition , it has also been shown that PLC η 2 , but not PLC η 1 , can be activated by G βγ , which is released from trimeric G - protein complexes following G - protein - coupled receptor activation ( Zhou et al . 2005 , 2008 ) . The isozyme PLC η 2 is expressed in neurons with highest expression in the olfactory bulb , cerebral cortex and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus ( Nakahara et al . 2005 ) . It is also expressed within the habenula , the retina ( Kanemura et al . 2010 ) , in the pituitary and neuroendo - crine cells ( Stewart et al . 2007 ) as well as in non - nervous tissue such as the intestine and pancreatic islets ( Stewart et al . 2005 ) . Its specific function ( s ) within neurons is still unclear , although considering its sensitivity toward cal - cium , it is thought that PLC η 2 may act synergistically with other PLCs or calcium - activated processes ( Popovics and Stewart 2012 ) . PLC η 2 is expressed in the brain of mice after birth and increases until 4 weeks of age . Cul - tured hippocampal pyramidal cells showed a high level of PLC η 2 , whereas astrocyte - enriched cultures did not show any expression ( Nakahara et al . 2005 ) , indicating a functional role in neuronal formation and physiology . In accordance , deletion of the chromosomal region 1p36 . 32 in which PLC η 2 is located , leads to mental retardation ( Fitzgibbon et al . 2008 ; Lo Vasco 2011 ) . Previously , using a targeted knockdown approach , we found PLC η 2 to be essential for retinoic acid - induced neurite growth in Neu - ro2A cells ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) . Despite this , the precise mechanism by which PLC η 2 facilitates neurite growth in these cells is not known . In our previous study , through use of a bacterial two - hybrid assay we identified Lim - domain kinase - 1 ( LIMK - 1 ) as a putative C - terminal inter - action partner of PLC η 2 ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) . LIMK - 1 acts primarily downstream of Rho GTPases to phospho - rylate and inactivate cofilin family proteins ( cofilin1 , cofi - lin2 and destrin ) , which promote actin depolymerization and the severing of actin filaments during neurite out - growth ( Arber et al . 1998 ; Yang et al . 1998 ; Endo et al . 2007 ) . LIMK - 1 has also been shown to be a substrate for calcium / calmodulin - dependent kinase - IV ( CaMKIV ) during neurite growth ( Takemura et al . 2009 ) . Although it was revealed that PLC η 2 and LIMK - 1 do indeed co - localize in Neuro2A cells ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) , it is not known whether these two proteins directly interact in the cell , or whether such interactions occur during neurite outgrowth . To gain a better understanding of the role of PLC η 2 in neuritogenesis , we examine the importance of PLC η 2 activity and calcium - mediated activation of the enzyme for neurite outgrowth in Neuro2A cells stably overexpress - ing wild - type and mutant PLC η 2 proteins . In addition , we examine the intracellular localization of PLC η 2 in Neu - ro2A cells at the ultrastructural level and , through use of a proximity ligand assay , probe the interaction of PLC η 2 and LIMK - 1 in differentiating Neuro2A cells . Materials and methods Growth and retinoic acid‑induced differentiation of Neuro2A cells Neuro2A cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures ( Salisbury , UK ) . Eagle’s minimal essential medium ( EMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 2 mM l - glutamine and 50 units / ml of peni - cillin / streptomycin ( complete EMEM ) was used to main - tain Neuro2A cells and stable transfected clones . Neuro2A cells were differentiated as previously described by Zeng and Zhou ( 2008 ) . Briefly , cells were plated at a low den - sity ( 100 cells / mm 2 ) in 6 - well plates in complete EMEM which was changed to the differentiation medium the next day ( EMEM with 2 % FBS , 2 mM l - glutamine and 20 µM retinoic acid ) . Medium was replaced every day for 4 days . Micrographs showing cells at 4 - day differentiation were collected by a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope with a 10 × objective ( Carl Zeiss Ltd . , Cambridge , UK ) . Images were taken using an AxioCam ICc 1 digital camera ( Carl Zeiss Ltd . ) . Neurite outgrowth was assessed by taking four micrographs by random selection from all experimental conditions ( in each case , at least 220 cells were sampled per experiment ) , and experiments were repeated three times . All cells possessing at least one neurite with a length at least twice the cell body were considered differentiated . Results were expressed as a percentage of differentiated / total cell number . Generation of stable Neuro2A cell lines overexpressing wild‑type and mutant PLC η 2 An expression construct encoding residues 75 - 1238 of mouse PLC η 2 ( isoform a ; NP _ 780765 ) in pcDNA3 . 1 ( as used in Nakahara et al . 2005 ) was a gift from Prof . Kiyoko Fukami ( Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science , Japan ) . The pcDNA3 . 1 - PLC η 2 expression construct was used to synthe - size D256A and H460Q mutants using the Quikchange Site - Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Stratagene , Amsterdam , The Neth - erlands ) . Neuro2A cells were stably transfected with empty pcDNA3 . 1 vector ( control ) and wild - type and mutant PLC η 2 Histochem Cell Biol 1 3 expressing plasmids to produce cell lines overexpressing each protein . In each case , 20 µg of DNA was transfected by elec - troporation using a Bio - Rad Gene Pulser ( Hertfordshire , UK ) at 230 V , 950 μ F . Stably transfected cells were selected after 48 h by adding 500 µg / ml G418 ( InvivoGen , San Diego , CA , USA ) and single cell - derived clones were picked and cultured for further experiments . Measurement of PLCH2 mRNA levels in stable Neuro2A cell lines The mRNA expression levels of PLCH2 ( OMIM * 612836 ) forms in stable Neuro2A cell lines were measured using quantitative PCR . Briefly , mRNA was isolated using the Isolate RNA Mini Kit ( Bioline , London , UK ) accord - ing to the manufacturer’s instructions . DNA contamina - tion was removed by DNAse digestion ( RQ1 RNase - Free DNase , Promega , Southampton , UK ) . This was followed by a two - step reverse transcription reaction using 0 . 5 µg of mRNA . The mRNA was incubated with 100 pmol oli - god T 18 and 0 . 5 mM dNTP in DEPC - treated water at 65 °C for 5 min . RevertAid Premium Reverse Transcriptase ( 200 units ) , RiboLock RNase Inhibitor ( 20 units ; Thermo Fisher Scientific , Surrey , UK ) and 1 × RT - buffer ( Fermentas , St . Leon - Rot , Germany ) were added . Mixtures were incu - bated for 30 min at 50 °C followed by 10 min at 60 °C . Reactions were terminated at 85 °C for 5 min . PLCH2 and RPLP0 mRNA expression levels were detected by RT - PCR using primers obtained from Eurofins Scientific ( Luxembourg ) . The sequences of corresponding prim - ers used were : PLCH2 , 5 ′ - GGCTACACTCTGACCT CCAAGATCC - 3 ′ ( forward ) and 5 ′ - GGAAGCATGGT GGCATCTTCGCTGC - 3 ′ ( reverse ) ; RPLP0 , 5 ′ - GAGTG ATGTGCAGCTGATAAAGACTGG - 3 ′ ( forward ) and 5 ′ - CTGCTCTGTGATGTCGAGCACTTCAG - 3 ′ ( reverse ) . The RPLP0 primers were used previously as described ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) . The PLCH2 primers were designed in house and checked for specificity using adequate positive and negative controls . PCR reactions contained 1 × reaction buffer , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM dNTPs , 250 nM of each primer and 1 . 25 units of GoTaq polymerase ( Promega ) . Reactions were cycled at 95 °C for 15 s , 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min . The expression level of PLC η 2 was meas - ured by qPCR relative to the level of the large ribosomal protein P0 ( RPLP0 ) mRNA . Expression was detected by Brilliant III Ultra - Fast SYBR Green mix ( Agilent Technol - ogies , Cheshire , UK ) using a 7300 Real - Time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems , Massachusetts , USA ) . Expression levels were calculated by the Δ C t method . At least four col - onies were chosen from each stably transfected cell group , and qPCR analysis was performed simultaneously on their cDNA to evaluate the expression of inserted gene . Based on the gene expression , colonies that possessed comparable levels of PLCH2 in each transfection group were chosen for differentiation studies . Immunogold labeling and electron microscopy ( EM ) Samples were processed according to the Tokuyasu thawed frozen section method ( Tokuyasu 1973 ) . Briefly , Neu - ro2A cells stably expressing a PLC η 2 - targetted shRNA ( PLC η 2 KD ) or non - target shRNA control ( referred to as shRNAPLC η 2 - 1 and shRNA control , respectively , in Popo - vics et al . 2014 ) were grown to full confluency in a T - 75 flask before fixation with 4 % p - formaldehyde , 0 . 05 % glutaraldehyde , buffered with 0 . 2 M PIPES , pH 7 . 2 , for 15 min at ambient temperature . Cells were then scraped , collected and centrifuged at 16 , 000 × g for 15 min to form a pellet before cryoprotection in 2 . 3 M sucrose in PBS ( over - night at 4 °C ) . Small blocks were prepared from the pellets and mounted onto specimen carriers before plunge - freezing in liquid N 2 . Sections ( 80 nm thick ) were cut at − 100 °C ( Leica EM FC7 ultracryomicrotome ; Vienna , Austria ) and retrieved using droplets of 2 . 1 M sucrose : 2 % ( w / v ) methyl cellulose ( mixed 1 : 1 ) and mounted in the same solution on pioloform - coated EM copper grids ( Agar Scientific , Stan - stead , UK ) and stored at 4 °C . Prior to immunogold labe - ling , grids were washed three times in ice - cold distilled water ( 5 min each ) and once in PBS ( 5 min ) at ambient temperature . Sections were then incubated in 0 . 5 % fish skin gelatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS and labeled using a custom polyclonal rabbit antibody raised commercially against a short peptide of PLC η 2 ( 60 min ; SKVEED - VEAGEDSGVSRQN ; EZBiolab , Westfield , IN , USA ) , fol - lowed by three washes in PBS ( 15 min total ) and 10 nm protein A - gold ( 20 min ; BBI Solutions , Dundee , UK ) . After washing in PBS and distilled water , the sections were con - trasted using 2 % ( w / v ) methylcellulose / 3 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate ( mixed 9 : 1 ) , and after air - drying the sections were visualized using a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV and images observed and recorded using an Orius 200 digital camera ( Gatan , Abing - don , UK ) . Sections from shRNAPLC η 2 - 1 and shRNA con - trol samples were always run in parallel using the same solutions , dilutions and under environmental conditions . Cell structures were identified according to the following criteria : The nuclear envelope was a double membrane that separated the nucleus from the cytosol . Mitochondria were elongated or circular profiles with double membranes and at least one double - membraned crista profile . ER was defined as a double - membraned cisterna decorated by ribosomes . The plasma membrane was a single membrane layer at the cell periphery . The Golgi apparatus cisternal stack was iden - tified as at least two closely stacked cisternal membranes each with an axial ratio of at least 3 : 1 ( groups of vesicu - lotubular structures were considered as belonging to Golgi Histochem Cell Biol 1 3 if they were closer than two vesicle widths from Golgi cis - ternal structures ) . MVBs were round structures containing at least one round structure within it . Isolated vesicles were small round structures ( 50 – 100 nm ) within the cytosol . To analyze specific labeling , the control and knockdown preparations were fixed , sectioned and labeled in parallel using identical solutions . For quantification , labeled sec - tions were visualized at a nominal magnification of 5000 × and analyzed in a series of scans placed systematic uniform random ( SUR ; Lucocq 2008 , 2012 ) , across the ribbon of sec - tions . Gold particles were counted and assigned to different cellular compartments . To compare the intensity of labe - ling , membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear envelope were used as a standard to which gold labeling of various organelles / compartments was related . These stand - ard membranes were assessed during scanning by counting intersections of these membranes with the edge of a marker feature that was placed on the display screen . The density of gold particles was then expressed as a labeling index by dividing the number of gold particles by the membrane inter - sections . In the case of gold labeling situated over volume occupying compartments such as nucleoplasm and cytosol , the gold counts were related to the number of nuclear enve - lope and plasma membrane intersections , respectively . Proximity ligand assay of PLC η 2‑LIMK‑1 interactions Ligand proximity assays as described by Söderberg et al . ( 2006 ) were performed using the Duolink proximity ligand assay system ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Two sets of experi - ments were performed ; the first with Neuro2A cells stably expressing PLC η 2 - targeted shRNA and the corresponding non - target shRNA - expressing control cells and the sec - ond , with untransfected Neuro2A cells grown for 4 days in the presence and absence of 20 μ M retinoic acid . In all cases , cells were seeded at a low density ( 100 cells / mm 2 ) and grown on coverslips overnight . The PLA assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instruc - tions . For specific visualization of the PLC η 2 - LIMK - 1 interaction in cells , a custom rabbit anti - PLC η 2 antibody ( as described above ; 1 : 100 dilution ) and a mouse poly - clonal anti - LIMK - 1 antibody ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK ; 1 : 100 dilution ) were used . Samples were analyzed using the Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a 63 × objec - tive ( Leica Microsystems , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Results PLC η 2 activity is important for neurite growth A characteristic property of PLC η enzymes is their abil - ity to be directly activated by calcium released from intracellular stores ( Kim et al . 2011 ; Popovics et al . 2011 ) . To assess the importance of PLC η 2 activity in neurite out - growth and to determine whether calcium - induced activa - tion of PLC η 2 plays a role in this process , Neuro2A cells stably overexpressing wild - type PLC η 2 and mutant forms of the enzyme ( D256A and H460Q ) were created and analyzed together . Neuro2A cells stably transfected with empty vector only ( EV ) were used as a control . The D256A mutation has been demonstrated previously to abolish the ability of calcium to activate PLC η 2 through perturbation of calcium binding at EF - loop 1 of the EF - hand domain ( Popovics et al . 2014 ) . His460 corresponds to a key active site residue that is highly conserved within PLC isozymes ( Heinz et al . 1998 ) , and mutation of the corresponding His residue in PLC δ 1 ( His356 ) has been shown to abolish the activity of this enzyme ( Stallings et al . 2005 ) . Quantita - tive PCR analysis revealed PLC η 2 mRNA levels to be increased 3 – 4 - fold in all cell lines stably expressing PLC η 2 forms relative to control cells ( Fig . 1a ) . The cell lines were treated with retinoic acid for 4 days , and the propor - tion of cells showing signs of differentiation was assessed ( Fig . 1b – f ) . Following retinoic acid treatment , there was a slight but significant increase in the average percentage of differentiated cells observed in the wild - type PLC η 2 stably transfected cells ( 55 . 9 ± 0 . 9 % ) , relative to controls cells ( 49 . 0 ± 1 . 1 % ) , p = 0 . 0285 , n = 3 . Conversely , cells sta - bly transfected with the H460Q mutant exhibited a dra - matic reduction in the proportion of differentiated cells ( 2 . 4 ± 0 . 3 % ) relative to control cells after stimulation with retinoic acid , p = 0 . 0003 , n = 3 . A comparable degree of differentiation was observed in the cells stably transfected with the D256A mutant ( 44 . 9 ± 0 . 9 % ) relative to control after the treatment , p = 0 . 9195 , n = 3 . Note that errors quoted above represent S . E . M from three separate experi - ments . To reduce the possibility of type 1 errors , p values were corrected by applying Bonferroni’s correction . Immunogold localization of PLC η 2 in Neuro2A cells Because of the compartmentalized nature of cells , deter - mining a protein’s localization can provide a good indi - cation of its functional role . Therefore , we examined the intracellular localization of endogenous PLC η 2 in Neu - ro2A cells using quantitative immunoelectron microscopy ( EM ) . We used two previously generated Neuro2A cell lines ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) : one stably expressing PLC η 2 - targeted shRNA plasmid ( PLC η 2 KD ) and the other a non - target shRNA ( control ) . As determined by Western blot - ting , the cell line expressing the PLC η 2 - targetted shRNA plasmid was shown to exhibit a 67 % reduction in PLC η 2 expression at the protein level , and a ninefold reduc - tion in retinoic acid - induced neuritogenesis after 4 days , relative to the control cells ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) . The Histochem Cell Biol 1 3 signal intensities over a range of cellular compartments were compared as shown in Fig . 2a . The majority of orga - nelles were found to exhibit a higher signal in the control compared with PLC η 2 KD cells . The specific percentage of gold particles attributed to each organelle was then cal - culated in order to assess the degree of specific staining ( Fig . 2b ; Table 1 ) . The majority of specific signal , corre - sponding to the presence of PLC η 2 , was found in the cell nucleus ( 54 . 4 ± 3 . 5 % ) and to a lesser degree , the cyto - sol ( 27 . 4 ± 1 . 4 % ) and mitochondria ( 8 . 8 ± 2 . 6 % ) , A smaller specific signal was observed at plasma membrane ( 5 . 5 ± 1 . 3 % ) , nuclear envelope ( 2 . 2 ± 1 . 0 % ) , endoplas - mic reticulum ( 1 . 7 ± 1 . 5 % ) . No specific staining was observed over the Golgi apparatus or multivesicular bodies . Note that errors quoted above represent S . E . M from three separate experiments . PLC η 2 interacts directly with LIMK‑1 LIMK - 1 was previously identified as an interaction partner of PLC η 2 using a bacterial hybrid screen ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) . In order to attempt to clarify the direct interaction of PLC η 2 with LIMK - 1 , proximity ligand assays were performed using control and PLC η 2 KD cells . In each of these cell lines , fluorescent particles , corresponding to interactions between PLC η 2 and LIMK - 1 , were observed and were predominantly located within the cytosol , but some were also present in the cell nucleus ( Fig . 3a – c ) .

The statistical significance was established by one - way ANOVA using Tukey’s honest significance test .

Scale bars corre - spond to 10 µm Histochem Cell Biol 1 3 The number of fluorescent particles in the PLC η 2 con - trol cells was eightfold higher than in PLC η 2 KD cells , indicating the staining to be specific . The assay was also performed with non - transfected Neuro2A cells grown for 4 days in the presence or absence of 20 μ M retinoic acid . The retinoic acid - treated Neuro2A cells underwent normal differentiation , characterized by an enlargement of the cell body and neurite outgrowth ( Fig . 3d – h ) . The number of flu - orescent particles in retinoic acid - treated cells was approxi - mately eightfold greater than the untreated cells . Particles were observed mainly in the cytoplasm and within grow - ing neurites , as well as in the nucleus to a lower degree .

The number of specific gold particles attributed to each organelle was calculated as described previously ( Lucocq and Gawden - Bone 2010 ) . Briefly , specific density ( SD ) of gold particles was calculated by subtracting the average density of labeling for each organelle in PLC η 2 KD Neuro2A cells from that of control cells . SD was then divided by the average density in control cells to determine the fraction specific ( FS ) gold particles . Next , specific gold ( SG ) was calculated by multiplying FS by the total number of raw gold particles counted in each organelle in control cells . This was then divided by the total SG across all compartments and multiplied by 100 to establish the percentage of specific gold in each organelle . Data are expressed as average values across three experiments Specific density ( SD ) Fraction specific ( FS ) Total raw gold Specific gold ( SG ) % Specific Mitochondria 0 . 16 0 . 48 25 . 33 9 . 59 8 . 82 Nucleus 1 . 74 0 . 72 102 . 00 71 . 60 54 . 38 PM 0 . 12 0 . 75 9 . 67 7 . 15 5 . 47 ER 0 . 04 0 . 21 19 . 67 1 . 23 1 . 71 Cytosol 0 . 56 0 . 57 62 . 67 35 . 77 27 . 38 NE 0 . 07 0 . 53 5 . 00 2 . 29 2 . 25 MVB 0 . 14 0 . 33 1 . 00 0 . 00 0 . 00 Golgi 0 . 22 0 . 22 0 . 33 0 . 00 0 . 00 Histochem Cell Biol 1 3 These results confirm that PLC η 2 and LIMK - 1 do indeed interact and provide a strong indication that their interac - tion is important for retinoic acid - induced Neuro2A cell differentiation . Discussion The Neuro2A cell is an established cell model for the examination of molecular events that regulate neuronal differentiation ( Pankratova et al . 1994 ; Riboni et al . 1995 ; Carter et al . 2003 ; Kouchi et al . 2011 ) , and upon stimula - tion with retinoic acid , they change from a stem cell - like morphology to a neuronal one , including formation and extension of neurites . An essential role for PLC η 2 in neu - rite growth was previously demonstrated in Neuro2A cells ( Popovics et al . 2014 ) , which was further investigated in this study . Unlike most PLCs which comprise a non - calcium - sensing EF - hand - like domain ( Bairoch and Cox 1990 ) , PLC η 2 has a functional EF - hand domain containing Fig . 3 Proximity ligand assay allowing visualization and quantifi - cation of PLC η 2 - LIMK - 1 interactions in Neuro2A cells . Fluores - cent images in ( a ) and ( b ) are taken from control and PLC η 2 KD Neuro2A cells , respectively . Fluorescent particles corresponding to PLC η 2 - LIMK - 1 interactions appear in red and DAPI - staining of nuclei in blue . These micrographs are representative of the quan - titative data shown in ( c ) . c Graph showing the average number of fluorescent particles in each cell for control and PLC η 2 KD groups .

Error bars repre - sent standard error of the coefficient for five micrographs . The sta - tistical significance ( as determined by unpaired t test ) is indicated as * * * * p < 0 . 0001 . Scale bars correspond to 15 µm Histochem Cell Biol 1 3 a canonical 12 ‐ residue loop ( EF ‐ loop 1 ) ( Popovics et al . 2014 ) . We reported that EF - loop 1 is responsible for activa - tion of the enzyme by calcium through mutation of D256 ( to Ala ) , a key calcium - binding residue in this domain , which resulted in an apparent ~ tenfold reduction in cal - cium sensitivity in transfected COS - 7 cells ( Popovics et al . 2014 ) . In an attempt to assess both whether PLC η 2 activity is important for neurite growth and whether such involve - ment may be due to activation by calcium , we generated Neuro2A cells stably overexpressing wild - type PLC η 2 and mutant forms of the enzyme ( D256A and H460Q ) . Follow - ing retinoic acid treatment , there was a slight but significant increase in the percentage of differentiated cells observed in the wild - type PLC η 2 stably transfected cells , relative to controls cells . Conversely , cells stably transfected with the H460Q mutant exhibited a dramatic reduction in the pro - portion of differentiated cells ( ~ 25 - fold ) relative to control cells after stimulation with retinoic acid . A comparable degree of differentiation was observed in the cells stably transfected with the D256A mutant relative to control after the treatment . These results reveal that expression of the H460Q mutant has a strong dominant - negative effect on neurite outgrowth . These results further highlight the essential role of PLC η 2 in neurite outgrowth . In addition , they suggest that modulation of PLC η 2 activity by calcium binding at the EF - hand domain may enhance , presum - ably through positive feedback of calcium signaling , but is not essential to retinoic acid - stimulated neurite growth . It is therefore likely that the principal mechanism by which PLC η 2 is activated is not through calcium binding , but through another unknown mechanism . Recently , a new role has emerged for PLC η 2 in secretion of cytoplasmic dense core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells . This is accomplished by PLC η 2 - mediated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis following its activation by Ca 2 + . The decrease in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 causes dysregulation of actin binding proteins which results in F - actin disassembly , thereby removing the physical barrier which would otherwise prevent dense core vesicle up - regu - lation to the plasma membrane ( Yamaga et al . 2015 ) . In this process , reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is there - fore dependent on Ca 2 + activation of PLC η 2 . The authors did , however , show that this occurs only when intracellular Ca 2 + levels are very high ( ~ 800 nM ) , and showed exocyto - sis of plasma membrane dense core vesicles at lower Ca 2 + levels ( ~ 400 nM ) . This suggests that Ca 2 + activation of PLC η 2 may be involved in actin reorganization under cer - tain conditions that significantly elevate intracellular Ca 2 + levels . To establish where in Neuro2A cells PLC η 2 is specifi - cally located , we examined the subcellular localization of endogenous PLC η 2 by quantitative immuno - EM . This approach revealed the majority of endogenous PLC η 2 to reside in the nucleus . We also observed a relatively high degree of PLC η 2 to be present in the cytosol and to a lower extent , at the plasma membrane . The presence of PLC η 2 in the nucleus and cytosol is consistent with pre - vious immunofluorescent studies which also revealed a high degree of nuclear staining , corresponding to the presence of PLC η 2 , in these cells ( Popovics et al . 2011 ) . The PH domain of PLC η 2 has been shown to bind phos - phatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) with high affinity , a phospholipid which is abundant in Neu - ro2A cell nuclei ( Popovics et al . 2011 ) . Indeed PLC η 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 were shown to co - localize in these cells to a large degree ( Popovics et al . 2011 ) , and hence this inter - action could govern the cellular localization of PLC η 2 . If so , then it is also likely that PLC η 2 resides in the nucleus of neuronal cells as they have also been reported to possess high levels of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in their nuclei ( Neri et al . 1999 ; Kwon et al . 2010 ) . The presence of other phospho - lipases such as PLC γ 1 , PLC δ 4 and PLC β 1 in eukaryotic cell nuclei is well established ( Martelli et al . 1992 ; Dive - cha et al . 1993 ; Matteucci et al . 1998 ; Ye et al . 2002 ; Liu et al . 1996 ) . PLC β 1 is perhaps the best characterized of these and has proposed roles in mediating differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts ( Faenza et al . 2003 ) and erythroleu - kemia cells ( Fiume et al . 2005 ) , mainly through regula - tion of gene expression . It is therefore possible that PLC η 2 plays a similar role in neuronal differentiation . Evidence for a role in regulation of gene expression is supported by the observation that activation of retinoic acid response element ( RARE ) - associated gene expression is dramati - cally reduced in PLC η 2 KD cells ( Popovics et al . 2011 ) . As with the cytoplasm , PLC η 2 may also be responsible for regulating actin dynamics in the nucleus . Although β - actin has been identified in the nucleus , actin filaments have not been detected at interphase by common F - actin detecting methods ( Sellers 2004 ) . It has , however , been reported that ~ 20 % of nuclear actin forms polymeric structures , with rapid turnover ( McDonald et al . 2006 ) . Both cofilin and LIMK - 1 possess nuclear localization sequences and are present in the nucleus ( Abe et al . 1993 ; Goyal et al . 2006 ) . More recently , it has emerged that cofilin is required for RNA polymerase II functioning and transcription elonga - tion ( Obrdlik and Percipalle 2011 ) . It is therefore likely that PLC η 2 is involved in regulating gene expression and actin - related processes in the nucleus ; however , the precise role of nuclear PLC η 2 remains to be established and must be probed further . Another potential mechanism by which PLC η 2 may contribute to neurite growth is through regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics . LIMK - 1 , a specific regulator of actin polymerization , was previously identified using a bacterial - 2 - hybrid screen as a putative interaction partner of PLC η 2 ; however , a specific interaction of these two pro - teins within the cell was not shown ( Popovics et al . 2011 ) . Histochem Cell Biol 1 3 It is well established that LIMK - 1 deactivates cofilin family proteins by phosphorylation , which in turn prevents actin depolymerization and contributes to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Ghosh et al . 2004 ; Lorenz et al . 2004 ) . Accordingly , neurons from LIMK - 1 knockout mice show reduced or deficient growth cones as well as abnormal den - dritic morphology , synapse structures and spine develop - ment which manifest in behavioral changes such as the re - learning of spatial information ( Meng et al . 2002 ) . LIMK - 1 also appears to have contradictory roles ; activation of LIMK - 1 by Semaphorin 3A ( Aizawa et al . 2001 ) , or fibril - lar amyloid beta ( Heredia et al . 2006 ) for example , leads to growth cone collapse and neurite deformation , respectively . Based on these studies , it appears that LIMK - 1 is an essen - tial protein for correct central nervous system development , but its regulation is important for normal physiology and alterations to its normal functioning leads to human dis - eases such as William’s syndrome , which is characterized by mild to moderate mental retardation ( Meyer - Lindenberg et al . 2006 ) . To establish whether PLC η 2 and LIMK - 1 interact directly , we utilized a proximity ligand interaction assay which allowed quantification and localization of interac - tions between the two proteins . To attain a positive sig - nal using this approach , proteins must be in the proxim - ity of < 30 – 40 nm ; this distance is a good indication that proteins are close enough to one another to interact , or at the very least , participate in cross talk . By looking at com - piled Z - stack images , we were able to determine that this putative interaction took place mainly in the cytosol and within growing neurites , suggestive of a role in regulat - ing actin dynamics . Putative PLC η 2 - LIMK - 1 interactions were also observed in the nucleus , albeit to a lower degree . Accordingly , LIMK - 1 has a nuclear localization signal which drives translocation into the nucleus , and shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is indicated by presence of nuclear import and export sequences ( Goyal et al . 2006 ) . Upon cell differentiation , we observed a ~ six - fold increase in fluorescent particles in Neuro2A cells , suggesting that these proteins interact to a higher degree during differentiation . This may in part be due the fact that PLC η 2 protein expression is increased in Neuro2A cells following retinoic acid treatment ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) . Some evidence that PLC η 2 activation occurs upstream from LIMK - 1 comes from the observation that phospho - rylation of LIMK - 1 and CREB , a substrate of LIMK - 1 , is significantly reduced in retinoic acid - treated PLC η 2 KD cells relative to control cells ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) . Also down - regulation of either of these genes significantly decreases neurite outgrowth in cultured cells ( Endo et al . 2007 ; Popovics et al . 2013 ) . We previously proposed a model by which PLC η 2 may regulate neuronal differentiation ( Popovics et al . 2011 ) , whereby the generation of secondary messengers , Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and DAG impact upon cytoskeletal dynam - ics and gene expression , respectively . PLC η 2 can be acti - vated by G βγ dimers , but as retinoic acid acts upon nuclear receptors rather than GPCRs , it would seem unlikely that the enzyme is activated this way in the current context . PLC isozymes such as PLC δ 1 can be activated by kinases ( Fujii et al . 2009 ) , of which PLC η 2 may also be a target . It is in theory possible that PLC η 2 may be activated by LIMK - 1 ; however , without knowledge of a specific activat - ing phosphorylation site on PLC η 2 , this will be difficult to establish . Upon PLC η 2 activation , the level of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 will likely decrease with subsequent elevations in Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and DAG . Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 triggers calcium release from the intracellular stores to activate CaMKIV . The conse - quent stimulation of LIMK - 1 activity leads to activation of CREB which initiates transcription of genes direct - ing neuronal differentiation ( Popovics et al . 2013 ) . Here , we have clarified part of this model by demonstrating the direct association of PLC η 2 and LIMK - 1 in differentiating Neuro2A cells . This direct association could allow PLC η 2 to directly activate LIMK - 1 by promoting an active con - formation upon association , or it is possible that this inter - action simply allows PLC η 2 to be “on hand” to modulate LIMK - 1 activation via Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 release and CaMKIV activation . Changes in the nuclear DAG and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels may also influence transcriptional activity through modulation of DAG - PKC or PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - chromatin interactions . In conclusion , we reveal that PLC η 2 activity in Neu - ro2A cells is important for retinoic acid - induced neur - ite growth but is not dependent upon calcium binding at EF - loop 1 , highlighting the fact that activation of PLC η 2 during this process does not primarily occur through cal - cium binding , but via another unknown mechanism . We also demonstrate that PLC η 2 is present in the nucleus and cytosol of Neuro2A cells and reveal that the enzyme interacts directly with LIMK - 1 in the cytosol and within growing neurites as well as inside the nucleus . This inter - action has important implications for regulation of actin dynamics and expression of genes implicated in neuronal differentiation .
