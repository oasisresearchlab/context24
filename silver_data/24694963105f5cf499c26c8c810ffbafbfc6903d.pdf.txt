B . ] ABSTRACT Elevated tumor interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) is partly responsible for the poor penetration and distribution of therapeutic agents in solid tu - mors . The etiology of tumor interstitial hypertension is poorly understood . We have postulated that the solid stress generated by tumor cells growing in a confined space compresses blood vessels and increases tumor micro - vascular pressure and IFP . To test the hypothesis that neoplastic cell loss would decompress blood vessels and lower IFP , we induced apoptosis in tumors with paclitaxel and docetaxel . Taxanes inhibited the growth of the murine mammary carcinoma ( MCa - IV ) and of the human soft tissue sarcoma ( HSTS - 26T ) . Taxanes induced apoptosis and reduced the density of intact neoplastic cells in both MCa - IV and HSTS - 26T . To determine whether neoplastic cell loss decompressed blood vessels , we measured the diameter of tumor vessels in HSTS - 26T tumors implanted in transparent dorsal skin fold chambers . At 48 and 96 h after paclitaxel , the diameter of tumor vessels was significantly increased . The increase in vascular diam - eters was associated with reductions in microvascular pressure and IFP . The changes in neoplastic cell density and IFP were also correlated . In the human glioblastoma U87 , which is resistant to paclitaxel , the IFP and cellular density were not modified by paclitaxel treatment . Collectively , these results support the hypothesis that solid stress generated by neo - plastic cell proliferation increases vascular resistance and IFP . The in - crease in vessel diameter induced by paclitaxel and docetaxel suggests that taxanes could improve tumor response by increasing the vascular surface area for delivery of therapeutic agents . INTRODUCTION Interstitial hypertension is a universal characteristic of solid tumors ( 1 , 2 ) . Elevated IFP 4 impedes transvascular transport of large mole - cules ( e . g . , monoclonal antibodies ; Ref . 3 ) and is believed to reduce tumor blood flow ( 4 – 6 ) . We have shown that , due to the high permeability of tumor vessels and lack of functional lymphatics in tumors , the MVP of tumor vessels is a major determinant of IFP ( 7 – 9 ) . MVP is dependent on arteriovenous pressure differences and the geometric and viscous resistance to blood flow . High vascular resistance in tumors is presumably the result of a decrease in vessel diameter , which , in turn , is induced by solid stress . The growth of neoplastic cells in a confined and stiff interstitial matrix can induce solid stress . We have recently estimated that solid stresses of 40 – 125 mmHg can be generated by neoplastic cells growing in agarose gels of varying stiffness ( 10 ) . We , thus , hypothesize that a reduction in tumor cell density will decompress blood vessels and , hence , reduce the MVP and IFP . To test this hypothesis , we have used the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel to induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells . Tax - anes are cytotoxic agents with antitumor activity in experimental and human tumors ( 11 – 14 ) . The antiproliferative activity of taxanes is due to their ability to inhibit tubulin depolymerization and , thus , stabilize microtubules . Consequently , the cells are arrested in mitosis , and a variable proportion of cells die by apoptosis ( 15 , 16 ) . Three tumor lines with different elastic properties and response to paclitaxel were selected : a human glioblastoma , U87 , which is resistant to paclitaxel , and a human soft tissue sarcoma ( HSTS - 26T ) and a murine mammary carcinoma ( MCa - IV ) , which are responsive to paclitaxel . U87 and HSTS - 26T are relatively stiff , whereas MCa - IV is a soft tumor ( 17 ) . The results show that tumor cells can compress tumor vessels and that blood vessel decompression by taxanes reduces the MVP and IFP . The increase in vessel diameter also suggests that taxanes can improve blood perfusion and drug delivery in tumors . MATERIALS AND METHODS Mice and Tumors . Eight - to 9 - week - old male athymic NCr / Sed nude ( nu / nu ) and C3H / Kam mice , bred and maintained in our defined flora - and specific pathogen - free animal colony , were used . Twenty four h before tumor implantation , nude mice were further immunosuppressed by whole - body irra - diation with 6 Gy ( 0 . 8 Gy / min ) using a Gammacell 137 Cs unit ( Atomic Energy Canada Limited , Ottawa , Canada ) . The human tumors HSTS - 26T and U87 were implanted in nude mice . The murine isograft MCa - IV was implanted in C3H mice . Paclitaxel and Docetaxel . Paclitaxel ( Taxol ; Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) was initially dissolved in absolute ethanol with an equal volume of Cremophor EL ( Sigma ) , sonicated for 1 h , and stored at 4°C for up to 1 week . The final paclitaxel solution was prepared by diluting the stock solution 4 times with sterile physiological saline and injected within 10 min of prepa - ration . Docetaxel was provided by Dr . M . C . Bissery ( Taxotere ; Rhoˆne Poulenc Rorer , Vitry sur Seine Cedex , France ) . The stock solution ( 50 mg / ml ) in absolute ethanol was stored at 2 20°C . The final solution was obtained by mixing 1 volume of the stock solution with 1 volume of polysorbate 80 ( Sigma ) and 18 volumes of 5 % glucose solution , and it was injected within 10 min of formulation . Both drugs were injected at a dose of 40 mg / kg body weight into the tail vein . In the control groups , only the drug carrier ( Cremo - phor or polysorbate 80 ) was injected . IFP and MVP Measurements . IFP was measured with the “wick - in - needle” technique ( 18 ) . The pressure in each tumor was the average of two IFP measurements . IFP was measured at 9 , 24 , 48 , 72 , and 96 h ( up to 120 h with HSTS - 26T ) after paclitaxel or docetaxel injections . IFP was measured at two different times in the same tumor ( a ) 9 and 48 h , ( b ) 24 and 72 h , and ( c ) 96 and 120 h after paclitaxel and docetaxel injections and in untreated tumors . The initial IFP was measured at a tumor size of ; 250 mm 3 . There were 7 – 10 mice per group . Mice were anesthetized with ketamine ( 100 mg / kg ) and xylazine ( 10 mg / kg ) and placed on a heating pad to maintain the body temperature at 37°C . The MVP was measured in vessels at the surface of HSTS - 26T tumors ( 8 3 8 mm ) with the micropuncture technique and a servo - null system ( 7 ) . The IFP was also measured using the same technique at 1 – 2 mm from the tumor surface . The skin overlying the tumors was stretched due to tumor growth , which permitted the visualization of vessels located at the skin - tumor interface . Micropipettes were easily introduced in superficial vessels through the skin . MVP was measured in two to four vessels per tumor . Following the measure - ment , a small volume of Evans blue dye ( 0 . 05 % by weight ) was injected to Received 2 / 15 / 99 ; accepted 6 / 3 / 99 .

Mouse serum filled the flow cell and a 10 - cm portion of the inflow and outflow lines . A constant hydrostatic pressure head ( ; 7 mmHg ) was applied across the tissue slice , the flow was measured by recording with a charge coupled device camera ( AVC - D7 ; Sony , Tokyo , Japan ) linked to a stereomicroscope ( SMZ - U ; Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) , the movement of an air bubble that was introduced in the capillary flow meters . Capillary flow was analyzed off - line . Hydraulic conductivity measurements were obtained by a least squares nonlinear regression of the integral of a monoexponential func - tion to the experimental data . Vessel Diameter and Blood Velocity . HSTS - 26T tumors were trans - planted on the striated skin muscle in the dorsal skin fold chamber of SCID mice instead of nude mice . SCID mice were used because the skin of nude mice cannot hold a dorsal skin fold chamber for several weeks . To test whether the effect of paclitaxel on tumor IFP was similar in SCID and nude mice , we grew HSTS - 26T tumors s . c . in SCID mice . At 48 h following paclitaxel , IFP decreased by 54 % , which is comparable to the IFP decrease in HSTS - 26T transplanted in nude mice ( see “Results” ) . The chamber preparation , tumor implantation , and measurements of func - tional vessel density ( defined as total length of vessels per unit area ) , vessel diameter , and RBC velocity were performed as described previously ( 21 ) . The development of the tumor neovasculature was characterized 2 – 3 weeks after tumor implantation with an intravital microscope ( Axioplan , Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . Each parameter was measured in randomly selected vessels before paclitaxel injection , as well as 48 and 96 h after paclitaxel injection . In the untreated group , vascular parameters were also measured at 0 , 48 , and 96 h . Fig . 2 .

The tumors were collected , formalin - fixed , and paraffin - embedded . Tissue blocks were cut into 4 - m m sections that were stained for TUNEL or anti - CD31 . At different times ( 9 – 120 h ) after treatment with taxanes , apoptotic cells were detected by using the nick end labeling technique ( Apoptag - Peroxidase kit ; Oncor Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) . Briefly , dewaxed sections were rehydrated and treated with 0 . 2 % proteinase K ( Sigma ) for 30 min at 37°C before endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 2 % hydrogen peroxide for 5 min . Slides were incubated with terminal deoxynucle - otidyl transferase enzyme and digoxigenin - labeled nucleotides for 1 h at 37°C followed by an incubation with antidigoxigenin - peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature . Slides were then developed with diaminobenzidine and counter - stained with hematoxylin . Five fields of nonnecrotic areas ( 0 . 067 mm 2 per field ) were randomly selected in each histological specimen . The number of apoptotic and intact tumor cells per mm 2 was determined . For vessel density , tumor sections were stained with the anti - CD31 mono - clonal antibody ( clone MEC13 . 3 ; PharMingen , San Diego , CA ) using the avidin - biotin peroxidase procedure ( Vectastain ; Vector Laboratories , Inc . , Burlingame , CA ) . Dewaxed sections were rehydrated and treated with 0 . 1 % trypsinase ( Sigma ) for 30 min at 37°C before endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 2 % hydrogen peroxide for 5 min . The slides were placed in normal rabbit serum for 20 min and then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti - CD31 diluted 1 : 50 in normal rabbit serum . The slides were then incubated with rabbit antirat biotinylated antibody , followed by peroxidase - conjugated avidin . After the diaminobenzidine reaction , the section were counterstained with hematoxylin . In each section histologically recognizable blood vessels were used as internal control for CD31 immunostaining . Microvessel quanti - tation was performed according to Bossi et al . ( 22 ) . Areas of high vessel density ( hot spots ) were identified at low magnification ( 3 40 ) . The vessels in selected areas ( 0 . 27 mm 2 were counted at a magnification of 3 200 . Cluster of endothelial cells , with or without a lumen , were considered as individual vessels . Microvessel counts were expressed as the number of vessels per field . Statistical Analysis . All measured values are presented as the mean 6 SD . Significant differences between groups were evaluated by ANOVA or the Mann - Whitney U test . P s of , 0 . 05 were considered significant . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Tumor Growth Is Inhibited by Taxanes . Treatment with pacli - taxel and docetaxel significantly inhibited the growth of MCa - IV and HSTS - 26T ( Fig . 1 ) . U87 treated with paclitaxel grew at the same rate as control tumors , whereas docetaxel retarded the growth of U87 ( Fig . 1 ) . In accordance with in vitro studies , docetaxel was found to be a more potent cytotoxic agent than paclitaxel ( 23 ) . Taxane - induced Apoptosis Reduces Neoplastic Cell Density . To determine whether tumor growth inhibition was related to taxane - induced apoptosis and a resulting decrease in neoplastic cell density , we counted apoptotic and intact neoplastic cells on TUNEL - stained tissue sections . In MCa - IV , paclitaxel and docetaxel induced a rapid increase in the number of apoptotic cells that was close to control values at 48 h ( Fig . 2 ) . Neoplastic cell density was significantly reduced by taxane treatment ( Fig . 2 ) . The extent and kinetics of apoptosis induction in MCa - IV ( from 9 to 24 h ) were comparable to previous findings for MCa - IV ( 15 , 16 ) . In HSTS - 26T , the number of apoptotic cells increased at early time points , and the neoplastic cell number decreased with time ( Fig . 2 ) . The number of apoptotic cells increased slightly following taxane in U87 , but no significant differ - ence in apoptosis or cell density was found between treated and control tumors . Paclitaxel Increases the Diameter of Tumor Vessels . To assess whether neoplastic cell loss would decompress blood vessels , we measured vessel diameter in HSTS - 26T transplanted in dorsal skin fold chambers . Vascular density and RBC velocity were also meas - ured in the same tumor preparation . Paclitaxel increased blood veloc - ity ; however , there was no change in vessel density ( Table 1 ) . The vascular diameter of treated tumors was increased significantly at 48 and 96 h ( Table 1 ) , whereas that of untreated control group did not change significantly ( data not shown ) . The doubling of vascular diameter at 96 h indicates that the vascular surface area increased by 2 - fold . The increase in RBC velocity and vessel diameter suggests that blood flow increased by severalfold ( ; 3 – 5 - fold ) . Increases in vascu - lar surface area and perfusion are likely to increase drug delivery in tumors responding to taxanes . Relationship between Tumor Blood Vessels and Neoplastic Cells . Modifications in vascular architecture and the relationship between tumor cells and blood vessels were characterized histologi - cally . An antibody against CD31 was used to reveal blood vessels . Microvessel counts were made in regions of high vessel density ( hot spots ) . Similar to the intravitally measured vascular density in HSTS - 26T , taxane treatment did not modify the vascular counts on histo - Fig . 3 . a , antibody against CD31 was used to localize blood vessels in untreated MCa - IV .

Although numerically microvessel counts did not vary , there were significant differences in the frequency of collapsed blood vessels . Open and collapsed vessels were observed in untreated MCa - IV . Collapsed vessel segments could extend for 200 – 300 m m ( Fig . 3 a ) . Paclitaxel and docetaxel reduced the frequency of collapsed vessels . In untreated tumors , neoplastic cells often appeared in contact with the vascular endothelium ( Fig . 3 a ) . At 24 h , taxane treatment induced a cuff rich in apoptotic cells surrounding several vessels ( Fig . 3 b ) . At 48 h , vessels were surrounded by connective tissue that was almost completely free of intact tumor cells . In HSTS - 26T , the distribution of apoptotic cells was random , and no preferential cell loss was associ - ated with the perivascular region . Collapsed vessels were frequently observed in untreated and treated HSTS - 26T tumors ( Fig . 3 c ) . How - ever , at later time points ( 48 – 120 h ) , especially with docetaxel , there were fewer collapsed vessels . At 120 h , in tumors treated with docetaxel , most vessels had an open lumen , and intact tumor cells were rare ( Fig . 3 d ) . The tumor was occupied by apoptotic cells , cells in mitotic arrest , multinucleated cells , and cellular debris . In contrast , paclitaxel - treated tumors ( at 120 h ) had blood vessels with a collapsed lumen that were observed in regions occupied by intact neoplastic cells as well as by cellular debris . Thus , solid stress induced by the tumor cell burden apparently can decrease the diameter of tumor vessels ( as indicated by the in vivo data in Table 1 ) and collapse some blood vessels . Blood Vessel Decompression Lowers the MVP and IFP . Be - cause the vessel radius is a major determinant of vascular resistance and MVP , we tested whether the increase in tumor vessel diameter induced by paclitaxel would lower MVP and IFP . MVP is a main driving force for IFP ; thus , a change in MVP will cause a rapid modification in IFP ( 3 , 7 ) . The MVP and IFP were measured in HSTS - 26T with the micropuncture technique ( see “Materials and Methods” ) . At 24 h following paclitaxel , there was a significant decrease in tumor MVP and IFP . MVP was 13 . 5 6 3 . 0 mmHg in controls and 9 . 0 6 2 . 0 mmHg in treated tumors , whereas IFP de - creased from 20 . 0 6 5 . 5 to 9 . 5 6 0 . 8 mmHg . A higher IFP value prior to treatment could be due to a pressure drop in microvessels from the center to the periphery of tumors . Because of the increased diameter of blood vessels following treatment , this pressure drop became negligible . A decreased MVP could also be due to a reduction in MABP . To exclude this possibility , MABP was also measured . There was no modification in MABP following the injection of paclitaxel ; the MABPs of control and treated animals ( 24 h after paclitaxel ) were 107 6 5 and 115 6 4 mmHg , respectively . The IFP reduction could also result from increased fluid flow through the interstitial space . To exclude this possibility , hydraulic conductivity ( or ease of fluid move - ment ) was measured in vitro across slices of HSTS - 26T . Following paclitaxel , hydraulic conductivity increased significantly by ; 2 - fold ( from 5 . 5 3 10 2 9 6 2 . 0 3 10 2 9 at 0 h to 11 . 5 3 10 2 9 at 24 h and 12 . 5 3 10 2 9 cm 2 / mmHg / s at 96 h ; P , 0 . 02 , Mann - Whitney U test ) . On the basis of the mathematical model of Baxter and Jain ( 24 ) , a 2 - fold increase in hydraulic conductivity is insufficient to reduce IFP . In HSTS - 26T , fluid flow would need to increase by two to three orders of magnitude to reduce IFP . Thus , following paclitaxel injec - tion , MVP reduction is the likely cause of the IFP decrease . To evaluate for possible correlations between IFP and changes in cellular density and tumor growth , IFP was measured with the wick - in - needle technique in MCa - IV , U87 , and HSTS - 26T at different times after a single dose of 40 mg / kg paclitaxel or docetaxel . Because of probable changes in pressure with tumor growth , the IFPs of untreated and treated tumors were measured at the same time points . The IFP of HSTS - 26T and U87 was independent of tumor growth . In contrast , the IFP of MCa - IV decreased over the period of 9 – 96 h ( P , 0 . 05 ; Fig . 4 ) . In MCa - IV , IFP decreased significantly following paclitaxel and docetaxel treatments . The IFP of HSTS - 26T was sig - nificantly reduced from 24 to 96 h after paclitaxel and docetaxel injections ( Fig . 4 ) . In contrast to MCa - IV and HSTS - 26T , there was a significant delay that preceded the IFP reduction in U87 treated with docetaxel ; IFP decreased by 33 and 42 % at 72 and 96 h , respectively ( data not shown ) . Paclitaxel did not decrease the IFP of U87 tumors , which do not respond to paclitaxel . In tumors with a growth delay induced by paclitaxel or docetaxel , IFP was reduced . Relationships among Neoplastic Cell Density , Tumor Growth , and IFP . Neoplastic cell death induced by taxanes was consistent with the concept that tumor IFP was dependent on neoplastic cell density and tumor growth . IFP , neoplastic cell density , and tumor growth were significantly decreased in MCa - IV and HSTS - 26T tu - mors from 24 to 72 h and 24 to 96 h , respectively . Conversely , the IFP increased following neoplastic cell repopulation of MCa - IV treated with paclitaxel ; at 96 h IFP , cell density and tumor volume increased ( Figs . 1 , 2 , and 4 ) . The cellular density was comparable to values found in untreated MCa - IV . The tumor growth delay induced by docetaxel in U87 was associated with a reduction in IFP ( data not shown ) . However , even if there was a slight increase in apoptosis ( which was not significant ) , we could not detect a difference in neoplastic cell density between docetaxel - treated and untreated U87 tumors . In support of our hypothesis , there was no reduction in IFP , cellular density , and tumor growth in the paclitaxel - resistant tumor U87 ( Fig . 1 ) . Fig . 4 .

An ANOVA multiple comparison test was performed to evaluate the difference in IFP at each time point ( p , P , 0 . 05 ) . 3780 TAXANES AND BLOOD VESSEL DECOMPRESSION Research . on April 13 , 2017 . © 1999 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from Potential Role of Interstitial Matrix . Modifications in IFP did not always track neoplastic cell density . At 9 h , in MCa - IV there was a significant decrease in cell density without a change in IFP , whereas in HSTS - 26T treated with docetaxel , the reduction in IFP was not associated with a decrease in cellular density ( Figs . 2 and 4 ) . In HSTS - 26T , at 120 h following paclitaxel , the IFP increase was not associated with an increase in neoplastic cell density . Because of the high hydraulic conductivity of tumor vessels , IFP decreases rapidly ( within seconds ) following a decrease in MVP ( 3 ) . Thus , the rapid equilibration of MVP and IFP cannot explain the difference in IFP response . Modifications in vessel diameter , MVP , and IFP following a change in neoplastic cell density are dependent on the solid stress and elasticity of the interstitial matrix and vascular wall . The rate of solid stress build - up or release will be a function of the elasticity and the magnitude of matrix defor - mation . Thus , even a slight deformation of a stiff matrix could induce high levels of solid stress , whereas a soft matrix will respond poorly to solid stress changes resulting from tumor cell growth or cell loss . Stress - strain tests have shown that MCa - IV responds poorly to an applied stress . In comparison , the matrix of HSTS 26T is relatively elastic ( 17 ) . The soft matrix of MCa - IV might explain the time delay in IFP response following neoplastic cell loss . The stiffer matrix of HSTS - 26T could respond relatively quickly , even to small changes in cellular density or in the volume of individual cells . At 9 h following docetaxel , the IFP decrease was associated with a small reduction in cellular density ( which was not significant ) and a 2 . 5 - fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells . Apoptosis can reduce the volume of individual cells by 40 – 50 % ( 25 ) . Small changes in cell volume could be significant because neoplastic cells represent . 80 % of the volume of HSTS - 26T tumors . Thus , in HSTS - 26T , small changes in cel - lular volume combined with the relatively small volume of the interstitial matrix could lead to a significant expansion of the matrix and diameter of blood vessels . The differences in IFP response between MCa - IV and HSTS - 26T tumors suggest that the transmission of solid stress produced by neoplastic cell prolifera - tion in a confined space is highly dependent on the physical properties of the interstitial matrix . Clinical Implications . The findings of this study have both prog - nostic and therapeutic implications . Our work and the work of others have shown that tumor IFP measurements can predict tumor response in patients ( 26 – 28 ) . In patients with cervical carcinomas , increases in IFP during radiation were associated with a poor response , whereas a decrease in IFP was indicative of a good response ( 26 , 27 ) . The mechanisms responsible for the changes in tumor IFP during treat - ment are poorly understood . This study provides insight into the effect of solid stress and the interrelationships among neoplastic cells , the tumor vasculature , and IFP . The increase in vascular diameter without a change in tumor vascular density indicates that taxane increases blood flow and the vascular surface area for exchange in tumors . Thus , taxanes could improve the delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors . Milas et al . ( 29 ) have shown that paclitaxel significantly increases the partial pressure of oxygen in tumors and enhances tumor response to radiation under air - breathing but not under hypoxic conditions . The increase in tumor pO 2 could be due to an increase in oxygen delivery and / or a decrease in oxygen - consuming cells . The combination of paclitaxel and her - ceptin ( antibody against the HER2 / neu receptor that blocks tumor cell proliferation ) significantly improves the tumor response of mammary carcinomas overexpressing HER2 / neu as compared to paclitaxel or herceptin alone ( 30 ) . Thus , the improvement of tumor vascular pa - rameters by taxanes could be a significant mechanism contributing to improved tumor response to antitumor agents . Increases in tumor vascular diameters and blood flow have also been induced by other chemotherapeutic agents and radiation ( 31 , 32 ) . Of course , the more efficient vascular network could also improve the delivery of nutrients making the tumor microenvironment more favorable for growth ( 31 ) . In conclusion , our data demonstrate that the reduction in tumor MVP and IFP with taxanes is associated with significant increases in the diameter of tumor blood vessels . Modifications in neoplastic cell density are most likely responsible for the changes in vascular archi - tecture and pressure . The transmission of solid stress generated by proliferating neoplastic cells is also dependent on the relative stiffness of the interstitial matrix .
