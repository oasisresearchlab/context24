3 Dual processes in reasoning ? * P . C . WASON University College London J . ST . 6 . T . EVANS Plymouth Polytechnic Abstract Previous results have shown that the introduction of negatives into the sentences used in a deductive problem affected behavior in a systematic way which was independant of the logical structure of the problem . In the present investigation , the subjects were asked to justify their responses when reasoning about such sentences . In accordance with previous results , the responses were dominated by the terms in the sentences regardless of whether they were negated . However , the justifications did vary when negatives were introduced in accordance with the logical consequences of the responses . The interpretation of these justifications as causes of behavior seemed implausible . It was suggested that they were rationalizations , or that there was at least some form of dual processing between behavior and conscious thought . The aim of this investigation is to elucidate the character of the reasons given for attempted solutions to the selection task , or four - card problem ( Wason , 1966 , 1968a ) . The problem is now fairly well known . In essence it consists in establishing the truth value of a conditional sentence , e . g . , ‘If a card has a vowel on one side , then it has an even number on the other side’ , by selecting for inspection the necessary and sufficient cards from a set consisting of a vowel , a consonant , an even number and an odd number ( under the restriction that each has a letter on one side and a number on the other side ) . The solution is to select the vowel and the odd number because only these two * We thank I . Keddie for conducting the Psycholinguistics Research Unit , Woltson experiment , and Dr .
