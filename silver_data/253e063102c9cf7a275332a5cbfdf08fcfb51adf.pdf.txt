As supply improves , a key question is whether vaccination remains an impactful and cost‑effective strategy given changes in the timing of implementation . Methods We assessed the impact of vaccination programme timing using an epidemiological and economic model . We fitted an age‑specific dynamic transmission model to reported COVID‑19 deaths in 27 African countries to approximate existing immunity resulting from infection before substantial vaccine roll‑out . We then projected health outcomes ( from symptomatic cases to overall disability‑adjusted life years ( DALYs ) averted ) for different programme start dates ( 01 January to 01 December 2021 , n = 12 ) and roll‑out rates ( slow , medium , fast ; 275 , 826 , and 2066 doses / million population‑day , respectively ) for viral vector and mRNA vaccines by the end of 2022 . Roll‑out rates used were derived from observed uptake trajectories in this region . Vaccination programmes were assumed to prioritise those above 60 years before other adults . We collected data on vaccine delivery costs , calculated incremental cost‑effectiveness ratios ( ICERs ) compared to no vaccine use , and compared these ICERs to GDP per capita . We additionally calculated a relative affordability measure of vaccination programmes to assess potential nonmarginal budget impacts . Results Vaccination programmes with early start dates yielded the most health benefits and lowest ICERs compared to those with late starts . While producing the most health benefits , fast vaccine roll‑out did not always result in the lowest ICERs . The highest marginal effectiveness within vaccination programmes was found among older adults . High country income groups , high proportions of populations over 60 years or non‑susceptible at the start of vaccination programmes are associated with low ICERs relative to GDP per capita . Most vaccination programmes with small ICERs relative to GDP per capita were also relatively affordable . † Justice Nonvignon , Mark Jit and Anna Vassall contributed equally to this work . * Correspondence : Yang Liu yang . liu @ lshtm . ac . uk Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 15 Liu et al . BMC Medicine ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 Conclusion Although ICERs increased significantly as vaccination programmes were delayed , programmes starting late in 2021 may still generate low ICERs and manageable affordability measures . Looking forward , lower vaccine pur‑ chasing costs and vaccines with improved efficacies can help increase the economic value of COVID‑19 vaccination programmes . Keywords Vaccination , COVID‑19 | SARS‑CoV‑2 , Economic evaluation , Affordability , Mathematical models , Decision‑ making , Programme evaluation , Public health interventions Background Since COVID - 19 vaccines were first authorised in late 2020 , many countries achieved considerable coverage in a short period [ 1 ] , reducing disease and economic bur - dens enormously . However , accruing COVID - 19 vaccine coverage in many African countries has been slow before 2022 , with one of the largest contributors being vaccine shortage [ 2 ] . Given roll - out efforts by the end of 2021 , it would be a substantial challenge for the region to achieve the 70 % coverage target by mid - 2022 as set out by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the Africa Cen - tres for Disease Control and Prevention ( Africa CDC ) [ 3 – 5 ] . The vaccine shortage has eased significantly since early 2022 [ 4 ] . By this time , however , many African Union member states had already experienced several epidemic waves involving multiple variants of concern [ 1 , 6 ] . A key question that these countries face is whether roll - ing out COVID - 19 vaccines remains an impactful strat - egy representing good value for money , having missed key windows of opportunities from early - to mid - 2021 . Continuing vaccination raises issues in respect of both cost - effectiveness and affordability in the region due to potentially low health impacts and high health oppor - tunity costs to other health services due to nonmarginal budgetary impact [ 7 , 8 ] . This study aims to inform future decisions about vac - cine roll - out and investment by retrospectively examin - ing the impacts of implementation timing and speed on COVID - 19 transmission using a combined epidemio - logical and economic modelling approach . This approach allowed us to factor in the potentially high seropreva - lence of the region , the emergence of multiple variants of concerns , and population characteristics key to the trans - mission of SARS - CoV - 2 ( e . g . population age structure , contacts , non - pharmaceutical interventions ) and the economic evaluation of vaccination programmes ( gross domestic product per capita ( GDP per capita ) , general public health expenditures ) . Given that the COVID - 19 vaccine roll - out occurred relatively late and slowly among African countries , we focused on answering two key questions : ( i ) how much health impacts and value for money could have been achieved had the vaccine roll - out been earlier and faster ? ( ii ) could late COVID - 19 vaccine roll - out efforts ( in late 2021 ) still provide considerable health impacts and value for money ? To answer these questions , we evaluated different vaccine roll - out scenarios in terms of health impacts , cost - effectiveness , and relative affordability by vaccine types among Africa Union member states . This is the first multi - country regional analysis of COVID - 19 vaccine strategies for Africa that links epide - miological models and economic evaluation with find - ings that reflect on between - country heterogeneities . The lessons learned could inform regional decision - makers on future vaccine roll - out decisions in Africa , particularly if reformulated vaccines become available in response to future variants . To our knowledge , this is also the first study to empirically examine the impacts of implementa - tion timing while appraising COVID - 19 vaccine policies . Methods We estimated the prevalence of infection - induced pro - tection against COVID - 19 by fitting a dynamic transmis - sion model to country - level daily reported COVID - 19 deaths . This procedure allowed us to capture different epidemic histories experienced by African Union mem - ber states . Cumulative health outcomes and disability - adjusted life years ( DALYs ) averted associated with different vaccine roll - out scenarios were then simulated . Combining health outcomes with data on the costs of vaccine delivery and COVID - 19 - related health services , we estimated the overall cost - effectiveness and relative affordability from a health sector perspective by the end of 2022 . This section provides essential information to understand the methods . Further details are presented in Additional File 1 . All analyses were done in R ( 4 . 1 . 0 ) . All data used are publicly available . Code and intermediate results can be accessed via our GitHub repository archived at Zenodo [ 9 ] . Characterising vaccine roll‑out scenarios By the time most African Union member states achieved 1 % COVID - 19 vaccine coverage ( August 2021 ) , the United Kingdom ( UK ) had vaccinated 74 . 6 % ( as of 31 August 2021 ) of its population [ 1 ] . By February 2022 , vaccine coverage in over 35 % of African Union member Page 3 of 15 Liu et al . BMC Medicine ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 states was still below 10 % ( Fig . 1a ) [ 1 ] . We explored possi - ble alternative vaccine roll - out scenarios that could have taken place in 2021 by varying two parameters : vaccina - tion programme start date and vaccine roll - out rates . The programme start date was defined as the date at which the first person in a country was vaccinated and was var - ied between 01 January 2021 and 01 December 2021 in 1 - month increments . We limited the testing window for start dates to before 2022 , as all African Union member states had introduced COVID - 19 vaccines by then [ 1 ] . Vaccine roll - out rate was defined as the number of doses administered per million population - day . In this study , we varied this parameter along three levels : 275 , 826 , and 2066 doses / million population - day ( hereaf - ter ‘slow’ , ‘medium’ , and ‘fast’ , respectively ) . These levels were derived from observed vaccine roll - out trajectories using a univariable linear model ( cumulative doses per million population - day ~ date ) and represent the median vaccine roll - out rates by tertile observed among African Union members [ 1 ] . The vaccine roll - out scenarios combining these two parameters ( n = 12 start dates × 3 roll - out rates ) are visualised in Fig . 1b ( age - specific example presented in Additional File 1 : Fig . S1 ) . We capped the maximum population - level vaccine coverage at 70 % , consistent with the target set by the WHO and the Africa CDC [ 3 , 5 ] . Assuming a two - dose schedule for COVID - 19 vac - cines , a country with a population size of n will receive a maximum of 1 . 4n doses of vaccines , likely via early and fast roll - out scenarios . Older adults ( 60 + years of age ) were prioritised in the vaccine roll - out process based on international guide - lines and common practices observed in the region [ 10 , 11 ] . In the transmission model , older adults were also characterised by higher susceptibility , higher percentages of infection showing symptoms , and high percentages of infections progressing to severe , critical , and fatal out - comes . We assume the maximum vaccine uptake rates among older adults to be 80 % and other adults 60 % [ 12 ] . Fitting and simulation using a dynamic transmission model The epidemic model used in this study was an adaptation of CovidM , an age - specific dynamic transmission model of COVID - 19 , which has been previously used to explore the impact of different vaccination strategies in the UK , European countries , and Pakistan [ 13 – 16 ] . Between - country heterogeneity has been captured by a wide range of health ( e . g . age structure , life expectancy , reported COVID - 19 - related deaths ) , behaviour ( e . g . community mobility , social contacts ) , economic ( e . g . GDP per capita , government public health expenditure , costs ) , and pol - icy ( e . g . COVID - 19 response stringency index ) factors using local data . The conceptual diagram of the trans - mission model is presented in Additional File 1 : Fig . S2 [ 14 ] ; the model is further described in Additional file 1 : Methods S1 [ 14 , 17 – 22 ] and S3 [ 13 , 14 , 23 – 25 ] ; complete parameter tables and their data sources can be found Fig . 1 Model parameterisation and vaccine roll‑out scenarios setup .

( b ) Vaccine supply trajectories of 36 vaccine roll‑out scenarios ( 12 programmes starting date × 3 roll‑out rates ) and the population level vaccine coverage levels they realise Page 4 of 15 Liu et al . BMC Medicine ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 in Additional File 1 : Table S1 - 6 [ 1 , 3 , 10 – 20 , 22 – 44 ] by category . We fitted this model to country - level daily reported COVID - 19 deaths during 2020 – 2022 , before the wide use of COVID - 19 vaccines , using maximum likelihood estimation and differential evolutionary algorithm ( full optimisation procedure described in Additional File 1 : Methods S2 ) [ 14 , 45 ] . The following parameters were estimated : ( 1 ) the basic reproduction numbers ( R0 ) ; ( 2 ) infection introduction dates ; ( 3 ) COVID - 19 death report - ing rate ; and ( 4 ) variants of concern introduction dates . The fitting process aims at approximating the immune profiles ( i . e . the levels of infection - induced immunity by age and the distribution of non - susceptible individuals within the population by compartments ) against SARS - CoV - 2 before vaccine roll - out . Among the 55 African Union member states , we identified 27 with sufficient data for model fitting . 1 The remaining 28 member states were excluded from further analysis due to either data sparsity ( i . e . < = 10 deaths / day throughout the fitting period , n = 26 ) or potential report - ing artefacts ( i . e . with single day accounting for > 5 % of the cumulative COVID - 19 deaths since early 2020 , n = 2 ) . These countries , despite of interest among regional deci - sion makers , are spatially clustered ( Additional File 1 : Fig . S3 ) , which makes reasonable extrapolation unfeasi - ble . The epidemic curves describing COVID - 19 - related deaths among 27 members included in this analysis are presented in Additional File 1 : Fig . S4 - 6 [ 1 ] . We explored vaccine roll - out scenarios with either mRNA vaccines ( with characteristics similar to those of the Pfizer - BioNTech COVID - 19 vaccines ) or viral vector vaccines ( with characteristics similar to those of Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccines ) . Six types of vaccine effect mecha - nisms were incorporated into the model : infection - , dis - ease - , severe case - , critical case - , mortality - reducing , and onward transmission - blocking . The vaccine efficacy estimates we used are presented in Table 1 . An alternative efficacy estimate set based on the lower bounds of their uncertainty ranges in existing lit - erature was tested as a sensitivity analysis . We assumed infection - induced immunity among naïve individuals to last 3 years on average [ 22 ] . Given the time horizon of this study , we did not consider the protection waning among fully vaccinated individuals . Decreased vaccine efficacy due to immune evasiveness ( e . g . against Omi - cron ) was implemented through changes in susceptibil - ity among vaccinated individuals . However , we assumed immune evasiveness only affects infection - and disease - reducing vaccine efficacies—other types of vaccine effica - cies remained constant . We projected four health outcomes under each vac - cine roll - out scenario : ( a ) symptomatic infections ; ( b ) severe cases that require hospitalisation ; ( c ) critical cases that require intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission ; and ( d ) deaths ( see Additional File 1 : Table S2 for param - eter sources and Additional File 1 : Methods S4 [ 14 , 15 , 23 ] for technical details ) . All outcomes were aggregated from 01 January 2021 to 31 December 2022 . We kept the time horizon relatively short due to the uncertainty around future emerging variants . However , vaccination programmes that start late may require time to present impacts . We extended the time horizon to 30 June 2023 as a sensitivity analysis . Calculating DALYs We used projected health outcomes to calculate DALYs incurred , which capture both mortality and morbid - ity burden . Mortality outcomes were converted to years of life lost ( YLLs ) using country - specific life expectancy [ 26 ] . Morbidity outcomes ( symptomatic infections , Table 1 Vaccine efficacy estimates by vaccine type In the context of this study , cases are defined as symptomatic infections ; severe cases are defined as those that require hospitalisation ; critical cases are defined as those that require critical / intensive care units at some point during their hospital stay . This includes cases that eventually proceed to death as their final outcome . These estimates are broadly in line with Barnard et al . [ 16 ] . However , Barnard et al . did not provide estimates for efficacy against critical cases [ 16 ] . Based on the relative relationship we observed between vaccine efficacy against severe cases ( i . e . hospitalisations of at least 2 days long with acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) code in the primary diagnosis field ) , critical cases ( i . e . hospitalisations of at least 2 days long with ARI code in primary diagnosis field and with either oxygen , ventilation , or intensive care unit use ) , and deaths reported in the UK Health Security Agency Vaccine Surveillance Report ( week 12 ) [ 46 ] , we assumed the vaccine efficacy against critical cases to be the average of that against severe cases and that against death . The alternative estimates used in the sensitivity analysis ( i . e . the lower limits from their estimated uncertainty ranges ) are from the same report [ 46 ] Outcome Vaccine efficacy Base case set | sensitivity analysis set mRNA vaccines Viral vector vaccines 1st dose 2nd dose 1st dose 2nd dose Infection 0 . 7 | 0 . 55 0 . 85 | 0 . 7 0 . 7 | 0 . 55 0 . 75 | 0 . 65 Cases 0 . 7 | 0 . 55 0 . 9 | 0 . 85 0 . 7 | 0 . 55 0 . 8 | 0 . 7 Severe cases 0 . 85 | 0 . 75 0 . 95 | 0 . 9 0 . 85 | 0 . 75 0 . 9 | 0 . 8 Critical cases 0 . 85 | 0 . 73 0 . 95 | 0 . 93 0 . 85 | 0 . 75 0 . 93 | 0 . 78 Deaths 0 . 85 | 0 . 7 0 . 95 | 0 . 95 0 . 85 | 0 . 75 0 . 95 | 0 . 75 Onward transmission 0 . 47 | 0 . 47 0 . 47 | 0 . 47 0 . 47 | 0 . 47 0 . 47 | 0 . 47 1 In alphabetical order : People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria , Republic of Angola , Republic of Botswana , Republic of Cameroon , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Arab Republic of Egypt , Eswatini , Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia , Republic of Ghana , Republic of Kenya , Republic of Liberia , Libya , Republic of Madagascar , Republic of Malawi , Kingdom of Morocco , Republic of Mozambique , Republic of Namibia , Federal Republic of Nigeria , Republic of Rwanda , Republic of Senegal , Somali Republic , Republic of South Africa , Republic of The Sudan , Tunisian Republic , Republic of Uganda , Republic of Zambia , Republic of Zimbabwe . Page 5 of 15 Liu et al . BMC Medicine ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 severe cases , critical cases and those who experience long - term health effects ( “Long - COVID” ) ) were con - verted to years lived with disability ( YLDs ) . We dis - counted YLLs over remaining life expectancy and additionally discounted DALYs according to the year in which COVID - 19 health outcomes occurred . In line with the WHO guidelines on the economic evaluation of immunisation programmes , we used an annual discount rate of 3 % [ 47 ] . More information on calculating DALYs can be found in Additional File 1 : Methods S5 - 6 [ 26 , 48 – 51 ] . Estimating the vaccine delivery and health service costs We collected data on country - specific unit costs per vaccine delivered by vaccine type from a health sector perspective in three countries ( Ethiopia ( a low - income country ) , Nigeria ( a lower - middle - income country ) , and South Africa ( an upper - middle - income country ) ) . For South Africa , we included observed vaccine delivery costs . However , at the time of this study , realistic vaccine delivery costs were not available for any other country in the region . Thus , in this study , we used a normative ( i . e . per - protocol ) ingredient - based ( i . e . itemised ) approach ( see Additional File 1 : Methods S7 ) [ 52 – 54 ] . The unit cost includes vaccine purchasing costs and related com - ponents and activities involved in the planning and deliv - ery of the vaccine ( e . g . planning and coordination , cold chain , transportation , and waste disposal ) [ 52 ] . Costs were then validated by experts knowledgeable of coun - try - level immunisation efforts . In the case of Ethiopia and Nigeria , this validation step was part of the health technology assessment process used to support decision - making around COVID - 19 vaccinations . We found that the unit cost of delivering mRNA vac - cines to be substantially higher than that of viral vector vaccines ( Table 2 ) . These differences are driven by vac - cine purchasing costs ( see itemised costs by country , activity , and component in Additional File 1 : Methods S7 , Additional File 1 : Tables S7 - 8 ) —for which we used the lowest purchasing price reported in the public domain for each vaccine [ 55 , 56 ] . We extrapolated these vaccine unit costs for other countries ( see Additional File 1 : Methods S8 [ 57 – 60 ] for extrapolation methods ; this process did not differentiate by country - specific purchasing agree - ments ) and other vaccination programme setups ( i . e . programme duration and daily vaccine roll - out rate , see Additional File 1 : Methods S9 for the extrapolation meth - ods , and Additional File 1 : Table S9 for sample extrapola - tion results ) . The extrapolation results indicate that faster vaccine roll - out rates are associated with lower vaccine unit costs due to fixed costs being spread between more vaccine doses ( Table 2 ) . Our costing approach assumed no increases in the price of scarce resources ( e . g . health - care workforce ) . For COVID - 19 - related health service costs , we used previously published country - specific estimates ( Table 3 ) and lengths of hospital stay [ 31 , 48 ] . All costs were con - verted to US $ 2020 using GDP deflators [ 61 ] . Similarly to DALYs , costs were discounted by 3 % in line with WHO guidelines [ 47 ] . Measuring cost‑effectiveness and relative affordability We estimated incremental cost - effectiveness ratios ( ICERs ) from a healthcare payer perspective for differ - ent vaccination scenarios compared to a no - vaccination scenario by dividing the differences in total costs between alternatives ( including vaccine delivery and COVID - 19 health service costs ) by the differences in DALYs incurred . Vaccination costs may be paid by country gov - ernments or external donors . To allow for between - coun - try comparison , we calculated ICER as a proportion of GDP per capita and thus intrinsically assuming a propor - tion of GDP per capita may approximate the underlying health opportunity costs [ 62 , 63 ] . We did not fix a single cost - effectiveness threshold and instead focused our discussion on ICER as a pro - portion of GDP per capita . This is because there are no Table 2 Vaccine unit costs by roll‑out scenario and vaccine type Summary of the vaccine unit costs by country ( n = 27 ) estimated for vaccine roll - out efforts starting in 01 August 2021 using medium and fast roll - out rates by vaccine types . The underlying methods have been described in Additional File 1 : Methods S7 - 9 . Raw data behind these estimates were presented in Additional File 1 : Table S7 - 8 . Further sample estimates by country are presented in Additional File 1 : Table S9 .

BMC Medicine ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 generally accepted cost - effectiveness thresholds for any country in Africa or , indeed , most of the world [ 64 ] . Fur - thermore , COVID - 19 vaccination is likely to have a large budget impact , and hence the thresholds calculated at the margin of budgets may not always apply [ 7 , 8 , 65 ] . In practice , a cost - effectiveness analysis using an over - estimated cost - effectiveness threshold may incur high health opportunity costs in budget - constrained settings as the programme under evaluation could affect existing public health activities . In low - and middle - income coun - tries , substantial uncertain remains around the appropri - ate cost - effectiveness threshold [ 63 , 66 ] . In this study , for simplicity , we assumed conditions where ICERs account for more than 50 % of GDP per capita are less likely to be considered cost - effective [ 63 , 66 ] . We ran additional multivariable regression analyses to explore the country - specific metrics that can link to ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita . We tested pop - ulation size [ 26 ] , proportion of population over 60 years [ 26 ] , proportion of population non - susceptible at the start of vaccine roll - out ( model fitted in this study ) , vac - cine unit cost ( estimated in this study ) , government gen - eral health expenditure [ 33 ] , and income group [ 34 ] . In this study , we defined the relative affordability of a vaccine programme in a given year as the annual incre - mental cost of the programme divided by annual gov - ernment general health expenditure [ 7 , 8 ] . The annual incremental cost of a programme is calculated by the sum of vaccination programme costs and the corre - sponding COVID - 19 - related healthcare costs minus the COVID - 19 - related healthcare costs without any vaccine during the entire time horizon and then standardised to the annual level . Since the external donor contribution may be uncertain ( or redirected through different fund - ing schemes ) in the COVID - 19 era , only domestic health - care budgets were considered . We estimated ICER as a proportion of GDP per capita and relative affordability to evaluate COVID - 19 vaccina - tion programmes . The two underlying streams of data used , GDP per capita and government general health expenditure , are not strictly correlated . As a result , cost - effectiveness and affordability outcomes may lead to different conclusions—vaccination programmes may be cost - effective but not affordable , and vice versa . Results The fitted model could broadly reproduce the observed epidemic history of COVID - 19 before vaccine roll - out by country ( see Additional File 1 : Fig . S4 - 6 for model fits and S7 for fitted parameter distributions ) . The projected impacts of viral vector vaccines on cases , deaths , and DALYs by roll - out scenario are presented in Fig . 2 ( see Additional File 1 : Fig . S8 - 10 for intermediate results and results for using mRNA vaccines ) . We calculated rela - tive reduction in disease burden instead of absolute dif - ferences to allow the comparison across countries with varying population sizes . For a given vaccination programme start date , faster roll - out rates are associated with a substantially greater disease burden averted compared to the no - vaccination scenario . For example , compared to the no - vaccination scenario , vaccination programmes starting in August 2021 ( when more than half of African Union member states with data ( n = 53 ) reached 1 % population - level vac - cine coverage ) could have reduced deaths by an average of 11 . 06 % [ median = 8 . 80 % , interquartile range : 5 . 87 – 16 . 20 % ; n = 27 ( countries ) ] under slow roll - out , 24 . 19 % [ 24 . 43 % , 21 . 78 – 27 . 18 % ] under medium roll - out , and 31 . 29 % [ 32 . 57 % , 25 . 72 – 36 . 68 % ] under fast roll - out . For a given vaccine roll - out rate , earlier roll - out start dates are associated with greater disease burden averted compared to the no - vaccination scenario . For example , under medium roll - out , starting in January could have reduced deaths by a mean of 50 . 30 % [ 51 . 29 % , 48 . 97 – 54 . 95 % ] . However , starting the same programme in August 2021 could only have reduced deaths by a mean of 24 . 19 % [ 24 . 32 % , 21 . 78 – 27 . 18 % ] . These decreasing trends in relative impact reduction are steeper for more severe outcomes , which reflects different vaccine effica - cies by outcome and the features of emerging variants of concern . Given the same start date , faster programmes may be associated with lower ICERs in relation to GDP per cap - ita ( Fig . 3 ) . At all income levels , medium and fast roll - out Table 3 Health service costs Summary of the vaccine unit costs by country ( n = 27 ) estimated for vaccine roll - out efforts starting 01 August 2021 using medium and fast roll - out rates by vaccine types .

BMC Medicine ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 scenarios are associated with lower ICERs relative to GDP per capita compared to slow . However , medium roll - out scenarios may result in lower ICERs relative to GDP per capita compared to fast . This can be explained by differential marginal effectiveness by age group as the fast roll - out scenarios quickly move into younger adult populations ( which are less cost - effective to vaccinate ) after vaccinating older adults ( Additional File 1 : Meth - ods S10 ) . Compared to older adults , younger adults are less susceptible and less likely to progress to more severe outcomes . The results of multivariable regression analysis linking country characteristics and ICER as a proportion of GDP per capita revealed that a country’s income group was statistically significant ( using type I error rate of 0 . 05 ) and had the largest explanatory power ( i . e . effect size , Addi - tional File 1 : Fig . S11 ) . Higher income groups were asso - ciated with low ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita . In upper - middle - income countries , ICERs account for , on average , − 2 . 52 % and 20 % of GDP per capita using viral vector and mRNA vaccines , respectively ( Fig . 3C ) . Vaccination programmes may be cost - saving . In low - income countries , ICERs account for , on average , 82 . 59 % and 313 . 52 % of GDP per capita using viral vector and mRNA vaccines , respectively ( Fig . 3A ) . These vaccination programmes are unlikely to be considered cost - effective . In low - income countries , only viral vector vectors and only when vaccination programmes start in the first half of 2021 could the average ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita have fallen below 50 % ( Fig . 3A ) . The proportion of population above 60 years of age and the proportion of non - susceptible individuals at the start of vaccination programmes were also statistically signifi - cant and had the next largest effect sizes . Higher propor - tions of population above 60 years of age were associated with lower ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita . Higher proportions of non - susceptible population at the start of the vaccination programme were associated with Fig . 2 Outcomes associated with different vaccine roll‑out scenarios for 27 African Union Members using viral vector vaccines . This figure presents the relative reduction in outcomes as a result of different vaccine roll‑out scenarios ( i . e . combinations of vaccination programme start dates and vaccine roll‑out rates ) . Relative reduction is defined as ( 1 ‑ outcome with vaccination / outcome without vaccination ) . Greater relative reductions indicate more effective vaccine roll‑out scenarios .

All other variables , except for government general health expendi - ture , were statistically significantly associated with ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita but had smaller effect sizes relative to the aforementioned three variables . Our sensitivity analyses around the time horizon show that drawing the line on 31 December 2022 affects how ICERs compare to GDP per capita ( Fig . 4 , top panels ) . Of 972 country and roll - out scenario combinations ( 27 countries × 36 scenarios ) , 34 . 88 % and 19 . 65 % returned different results when we extended the time horizon by 6 months while using viral vector and mRNA vaccines , respectively . These differences are expressed as devia - tions from the diagonal line in Fig . 4 . Deviations above the diagonal line indicate by extending the time horizon ICERs got larger . Stratified analyses revealed that most deviations above the diagonal lines had late start dates ; most deviations below had early start dates . An extended time horizon makes the observed contrast in ICER over start date ( Fig . 3 ) more extreme , indicating the robust - ness of our results to the analytical window . Using lower vaccine efficacies affects ICERs as pro - portions of GDP per capita to a much lesser extent . We expect low vaccine efficacy to be associated with high medical costs and low overall QALYs averted compared to the no vaccine used scenario and thus high ICERs as proportions to GDP per capita . This is the case with both viral vector and mRNA vaccines ( Fig . 4 , bottom pan - els ; non - empty cells exist to the top left of the diagonal line ) . While using mRNA vaccines , lower vaccine effica - cies may lead to lower ICERs as proportions to GDP per capita ( Fig . 4 , bottom right panel ; non - empty cells exist on the bottom right of the diagonal line ) . In these cases , lower vaccine efficacy leads to larger outbreaks earlier on , resulting in more individuals being protected by hybrid immunity by the time that the more transmissible strain emerges . The median relative affordability estimates for vac - cination programmes involving mRNA vaccines imple - mented with slow , medium , and fast roll - out rates are 3 . 85 % [ interquartile range : 1 . 26 – 10 . 24 % ] , 12 . 42 % [ 3 . 43 – 29 . 84 % ] , and 26 . 13 % [ 7 . 82 – 61 . 61 % ] , respectively , and for viral vector vaccines 1 . 09 % [ 0 . 18 – 3 . 02 % ] , 3 . 24 % [ 0 . 61 – 6 . 61 % ] , and 5 . 28 % [ 0 . 70 % - 10 . 98 % ] , respectively . In the context of low - and middle - income countries , scenarios where ICERs account for more than 50 % of GDP per capita are less likely to be cost - effective ( Fig . 5 , dotted cells ) [ 63 , 66 ] . Scenarios where ICERs account for less than 50 % of GDP per capita and where programme cost less than 10 % of government general health expendi - ture may be favourable policy options ( Fig . 5 , pattern - free cells ) . Some scenarios have negative net costs and ICERs , Fig . 3 ICERs in relation to GDP per capita by vaccine roll‑out scenarios . A . Low‑income countries . B . Lower‑middle‑income countries . C . Upper‑middle‑income countries . Each y ‑axis tick represents a country ; the y ‑axis is arranged based on ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita . The baseline for comparison is the no‑vaccination scenario ( 01 January 2021 – 31 December 2022 ) Page 9 of 15 Liu et al . BMC Medicine ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 indicating they are cost - saving and health - improving . Other scenarios ( 5 . 22 % and 1 . 11 % of country - and - roll - out - scenario combinations for viral vector and mRNA vaccines , respectively ) have low ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita but cost more than 10 % of government health expenditure ( Fig . 5 , striped cells ) . In these cases , some COVID - 19 vaccination programmes may still be cost - effective yet unaffordable . Decision makers may need to adjust their perceived health opportunity costs for a DALY , given COVID - 19 is now a new and leading source of health burden [ 7 , 8 ] . The need for this adjust - ment may be mitigated by shifting costs to external Fig . 4 Results from sensitivity analyses . Univariable sensitivity analysis dimensions : ( top ) time horizon ; ( bottom ) vaccine efficacies . In each panel , a total of 972 data points ( 27 countries × 36 vaccine roll‑out scenarios ) have been allocated into each cell based on value , with colours indicating the overall count of data points in that cell . In the bottom right panel , for example , the dark cell on the top right indicates there are approximately 500 country‑and‑vaccine‑roll‑out‑scenario combinations where the ICER relative to GDP per capita is greater than one in both the baseline analysis and when low vaccine efficacies were implemented . Deviations from the diagonal line indicate there are country‑and‑vaccine‑roll‑out‑scenario combinations returning different results in terms of ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita resulting from the univariable sensitivity analysis Fig . 5 ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita and relative affordability of COVID‑19 vaccine roll‑out scenarios . In each panel , a total of 900 data points ( 25 countries × 36 vaccine roll‑out scenarios ) have been allocated in each cell , with colours indicating the overall count of data points in that cell . Only 25 of 27 countries with ICER results also had relative affordability results . Data on government general health expenditure for Somalia and Libya were not available . In the top panel , for example , there are over 150 country‑and‑vaccine‑roll‑out‑scenario combinations where the ICERs account for 0 – 10 % of the GDP per capita and where incremental costs of the vaccination programmes account for 0 – 10 % of the country’s general healthcare expenditure . An unfavourable conclusion ( dotted pattern cells ) is extremely unaffordable ( > 100 % of general healthcare expenditure ) or one where ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita are too high ( > 0 . 5 ) ; a favourable conclusion ( pattern‑free cells ) is one where ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita are low ( < = 0 . 5 ) and programme costs are also low ( < = 10 % of general healthcare expenditure ) ; a mixed conclusion ( striped pattern cells ) is one where ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita are low ( < = 0 . 5 ) , but programme costs are high ( > = 10 % of general healthcare expenditure ) ( See figure on next page . ) Page 10 of 15 Liu et al .

Discussion Using a combined epidemiological and economic mod - elling approach , we explored how the timing and speed of implementation ( i . e . vaccination programme start date and vaccine roll - out rates ) affect vaccination pro - grammes’ health benefits , cost - effectiveness , and rela - tive affordability among African countries . We found that vaccination programmes with earlier start dates lead to greater health benefits and are more likely to result in small ICERs in relation to GDP per capita . Fast vac - cination roll - out leads to the greatest health benefits but does not always lead to the smallest ICERs in relation to GDP per capita . This is due to differential marginal effectiveness by age . Fast scenarios quickly move beyond the vulnerable and thus prioritised population ( defined as 60 + years of age in this study , see Additional File 1 : Methods S10 ) . These results should not be extrapolated to other parts of the world without further validation ; these results also should not be extrapolated to other vac - cine products due to the fundamental differences in the underlying epidemiology . Higher income groups and greater proportions of pop - ulation over 60 years of age were associated with lower ICERs as proportions to GDP per capita . Greater propor - tions of populations non - susceptible at the start of vac - cination programmes were associated with higher ICERs as proportions of GDP per capita . The proportions of populations non - susceptible at the start of vaccination programmes were estimated by fitting a dynamic trans - mission model in this study . In practice , decision - making based on this metric requires accurate serological sur - veys , which is particularly challenging to conduct in pan - demic response settings . There were missed opportunities in early - to mid - 2021 for COVID - 19 vaccination to save more lives in Africa . However , even with a late start , certain vaccine types and roll - out rates combinations may still generate rela - tively low ICERs . Two factors could further increase the economic value of vaccination programmes . First , our results are based on the known immune dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 and the performance of current COVID - 19 vaccines . New vaccines with better effectiveness against emerging variants could decrease ICER by increasing health benefits . Emerging variants with the protection advantage of vaccine - induced immunity over infection - induced immunity may have the same effect . Second , our results show that vaccine roll - out sce - narios are much more likely to be cost - effective when using viral vector vaccines than mRNA vaccines . The relatively similar vaccine efficacy estimates against severe health outcomes ( Table 1 ) and the drastically different vaccine unit costs ( Table 2 ) may explain this . The main driver of vaccine unit costs is vaccine price . Some low - income countries may struggle to find COVID - 19 vac - cination programmes cost - effective after factoring in budget constraints and potential health opportunity costs . This highlights the importance of achieving even lower vaccine purchasing prices than those we assumed in this analysis . In this study , we estimated that the price of viral vector vaccines may be reduced by 10 . 32 – 28 . 69 % and mRNA vaccines by 36 . 91 - 60 . 96 % to reduce ICERs to 10 – 50 % of GDP per capita ( Additional File 1 : Fig . S12 ) . We found a small number of countries where ICERs were small in relation to GDP per capita , yet the pro - grammes were relatively unaffordable . The implication is that the investment in managing COVID - 19 , a new and leading cause of disease burden , may risk opportunity costs for existing public health and health service issues . Our affordability estimates are from a health sector per - spective and have not explicitly accounted for the poten - tial externalities on the local health systems and essential health services . Unless development partners provide subsidies that compensate for these effects , the perceived opportunity cost of a DALY , which is often approxi - mated using a fraction of GDP per capita , may need to be further adjusted down from what we already know them for in low - and middle - income settings ( which are low ) [ 7 , 8 , 63 , 66 ] . Affordability and ICERs in relation to GDP per capita are two of many metrics that stakehold - ers base their decisions on while planning for vaccine programmes . This is the first study to examine the role of timing in the cost - effectiveness of COVID - 19 vaccination pro - grammes . We highlighted key issues to consider in the next pandemic ( or next epidemic waves triggered by emerging variants of concern ) to come . Timing has already been shown to influence the health impacts of vaccination programmes . Incorporating it into economic evaluation would lead to more accurate and realistic cost - effectiveness assessments [ 67 , 68 ] . We fit a mathematical model with a range of plausible vaccine effect mecha - nisms to the COVID - 19 epidemic histories in 27 African Union member states . Most existing modelling studies on the economic evaluation of COVID - 19 vaccination strategies have either focused on a single country [ 69 ] or city [ 15 ] or used hypothetical epidemic histories that are Page 12 of 15 Liu et al . BMC Medicine ( 2023 ) 21 : 85 not based on data from any country [ 70 ] , which hinders the interpretability and generalisability of their results . It is not the objective of this study to directly inform COVID - 19 vaccine policies in individual countries . A regional analysis constrained us to use only data streams available in all countries under consideration . Thus , although we provided country - specific estimates in our GitHub repository , we caution national - level stakehold - ers against interpreting these results out of the regional context . Evidence for informing policies in individual countries may be generated by better - fitted transmis - sion models ( e . g . channelling more locally available data streams , such as more detailed non - pharmaceutical interventions and ICU occupancy ) using the modelling framework we presented here ( code available through our GitHub repository ) . Our study has several limitations . First , our epi - demic model has not captured the full complexity of the immune dynamics against SARS - CoV - 2 , which involves both vaccination and infections . For example , our model assumed that vaccinated individuals who had prior infec - tion histories were completely protected against SARS - CoV - 2 . This design is intended to ensure that most individuals within the model receive a maximum of two doses of vaccine . However , we cannot capture a small number of breakthrough infections that may still happen . These tend to be mild cases and , thus , should not alter our results substantially [ 71 ] . Despite best efforts , there may be additional factors that may affect the epidemiol - ogy of COVID - 19 that we have not implemented in this model ( e . g . baseline prevalence of chronic health con - ditions ) . Second , we assumed the vaccine supply short - age was the only reason for slow uptake . In practice , uptake may also be slowed down by factors such as vac - cine hesitancy [ 72 ] . The vaccine delivery unit costs may have been underestimated in this study as the vaccina - tion programmes may require greater efforts in terms of social mobilisation . Third , we did not use observed costs of different vaccination programmes , as this data is not yet available . The normative approach ( i . e . per - protocol ) we took did not account for the resource wastes incurred in operations or the increased prices of scarce resources that may be associated with the pace of the roll - out , healthcare utilisation rate , or potential structural changes to local health systems as a result of COVID - 19 pandemic response . As a result , ICERs may have been biased . Fourth , the cost - effectiveness analysis we presented is from a country’s perspective and does not consider COVID - 19 transmission in nearby countries ( e . g . transmission spillover ) . Finally , our analysis took on a health sector perspective and did not account for soci - etal elements such as changes in productivity or the pres - ervation of key functions ( e . g . labour market , emergence response , healthcare , and education ) . These societal ele - ments specific to the COVID - 19 pandemic have been difficult to estimate and may vary substantially between countries—additional data and research on these ele - ments could improve the comprehensiveness of vaccine policy evaluation in the future . Conclusions We assessed the impact of COVID - 19 vaccination pro - grammes’ timing and speed on the health benefits , cost - effectiveness , and relative affordability in 27 African countries . We found that earlier vaccination programmes led to greater health benefits and generated lower ICERs in relation to GDP per capita . Although fast vaccination programmes yielded the greatest health benefits , they did not always generate the lowest ICERs in relation to GDP per capita as they covered larger proportions of individu - als who were less vulnerable . Lower vaccine purchasing costs and improved vaccine efficacies may improve the overall cost - effectiveness and affordability of COVID - 19 vaccination programmes .
