However , the regulatory mechanism and physiological significance of phosphorylation remain unclear . Herein , we identify ULK1 as a kinase responsible for phosphorylation of p62 . ULK1 co - localizes with p62 bodies , and directly interacts with p62 . This phosphorylation allows KEAP1 to be retained within p62 35 bodies , activating NRF2 . p62 S351E / + mice are phosphomimetic knock - in mice in which Ser351 corresponding to human Ser349 is replaced by Glu . These mice , but not phosphodefective p62 S351A / S351A mice , exhibit NRF2 hyperactivation and growth retardation , the latter caused by malnutrition and dehydration due to obstruction of the esophagus and forestomach secondary to hyperkeratosis . p62 S351E / + mice are a 40 phenocopy of systemic Keap1 - knockout mice . Our results expand our understanding of the physiological importance of the redox - independent NRF2 activation pathway and provide new insight into the role of phase separation in this process . Keywords : p62 / SQSTM1 ; ULK1 ; NRF2 / NFE2L2 ; KEAP1 ; liquid - liquid phase separation 45 Ikeda et al . , Page 3 Introduction Liquid - liquid phase - separated biomolecular condensates , liquid droplets play an important role in many biological processes , such as gene expression , protein translation , stress response , and protein degradation , by incorporating a variety of RNA and client proteins into 50 their interior depending on the intracellular context 1 . Autophagy is involved in the degradation of several cytoplasmic liquid droplets , including stress granules and P bodies , and defects in this process are thought to cause transition of these droplets to the solid phase , resulting in the development of intractable diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancer 2 , 3 . Of the droplets that have a unique biological function and are degraded by 55 autophagy , p62 bodies ( also called p62 droplets ) are liquid droplets formed by liquid - liquid phase separation ( LLPS ) of p62 and its binding partners , ubiquitinated proteins 4 , 5 . p62 bodies are involved in the regulation of intracellular proteostasis through their own autophagic degradation , and also contribute to the regulation of the major stress - response mechanism by sequestration of a client protein , kelch - like ECH - associated protein 1 60 ( KEAP1 ) 6 , 7 . An Unc - 51 - like kinase 1 ( ULK1 ) phosphorylates p62 at Ser407 , inhibiting dimer formation of the UBA domain of p62 8 , 9 , and subsequent phosphorylation of Ser403 by TBK1 , CK2 , TAK1 , and ULK1 allows binding of ubiquitinated proteins 8 , 10 - 12 . These phosphorylation events are thought to promote LLPS 4 , 5 . In the degradation of p62 bodies , 65 the ULK1 protein kinase complex consisting of FIP200 / RB1 - inducible coiled - coil protein 1 ( hereafter as FIP200 ) , ULK1 , ATG13 , and ATG101 is translocated onto the bodies by binding of the FIP200 Claw domain to p62 13 . Alternatively , the ULK1 protein kinase complex is recruited to p62 bodies through the interaction of FIP200 with TAX1BP1 , which localizes at p62 bodies through the interaction with a p62 binding partner NBR1 14 . 70 Subsequently , ATG proteins assemble around the bodies 15 . In the end , the p62 bodies are surrounded by autophagosomes due to the wetting effect 16 and the binding of LC3 or GABARAP to p62 on the isolation membrane 15 , followed by lysosomal degradation . KEAP1 is an adaptor protein of cullin 3 ubiquitin ligase for nuclear factor ( erythroid - derived 2 ) - like 2 ( NRF2 ) , which is a key transcription factor for a series of genes encoding 75 anti - oxidative proteins and enzymes 17 . In the canonical pathway , KEAP1 is inactivated by the modification of oxidants , and NRF2 is then activated via redox - dependent regulation 17 . This redox - dependent pathway has been shown to be important in redox , metabolism , and protein homeostasis , as well as in the regulation of inflammation and cellular protection against many pathological conditions 17 , 18 . In addition to this canonical pathway , a specific 80 region of p62 directly interacts with KEAP1 , competitively preventing the interaction Ikeda et al . , Page 4 between KEAP1 and NRF2 19 . The phosphorylation of Ser349 locating at the KEAP1 - interacting region of p62 enhances the interaction of p62 with KEAP1 , sufficiently resulting in full activation of NRF2 independently of redox conditions 20 . However , the kinase ( s ) and regulatory mechanism underlying the redox - independent pathway , as well as its 85 physiological significance , remain unclear . Herein , we show for the first time that ULK1 is a major kinase for Ser349 of p62 , both in vitro and in vivo . ULK1 directly interacts with p62 and phosphorylates Ser349 of p62 . ULK1 localizes in p62 bodies in vitro and in vivo in a FIP200 - independent fashion . While this phosphorylation does not affect the influx of KEAP1 into p62 bodies , it inhibits KEAP1 90 outflow , keeping KEAP1 in the p62 bodies and activating NRF2 . Knock - in mice with a phosphomimetic mutation , but not those with a phosphodefective mutation , exhibit persistent activation of NRF2 , which causes hyperkeratosis and consequently obstruction of the esophagus and forestomach , and eventually severe growth retardation due to malnutrition . Taken together , these results indicate the physiological importance of p62 body - and ULK1 - 95 dependent and redox - independent stress response . Ikeda et al . , Page 5 Results ULK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates p62 To clarify whether the UKL1 kinase itself has an effect on physical property and physiological role of p62 bodies , we first studied physical interaction of p62 with ULK1 or 100 its yeast homologue Atg1 using high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) ( Fig . 1 ) . ULK1 has a serine - threonine kinase domain ( KD ) at the N - terminus and two microtubule interaction and transport ( MIT1 and 2 ) domains at the C - terminus , all of which are conserved between yeast and mammals ( Fig . 1a ) . The KD and MIT1 / 2 domains are linked by an intrinsically disordered region ( IDR ) ( Fig . 1b ) . p62 has an N - terminal Phox1 and 105 Bem1p ( PB1 ) domain and C - terminal ubiquitin - associated ( UBA ) domain as well as several interacting regions such as LIR and KIR located in an IDR between the PB1 and UBA domains ( Fig . 1a and b ) . We purified recombinant p62 ( 268 – 440 aa and 320 – 440 aa ) and SNAP - tagged ULK1 and Atg1 ( Fig . 1c ) . HS - AFM of SNAP - ULK1 revealed that it contains two globular domains consisting of a KD and two tandem MIT domains , which are linked to 110 each other with an IDR , like Atg1 21 ( Supplementary Fig . S1a and Supplementary Movie S1 ) . Meanwhile , HS - AFM of p62 ( 268 – 440 aa ) visualized the homodimeric structure mediated by the dimerization of the UBA domain , forming a hammer - shaped structure with IDRs wrapped around each other ( Supplementary Fig . S1b and Supplementary Movie S2 ) . When each SNAP - ULK1 and SNAP - Atg1 was mixed with p62 ( 268 – 440 aa ) , the p62 homodimer 115 directly bound to SNAP - ULK1 and SNAP - Atg1 via dynamic IDR - IDR and IDR - globular domain interactions ( Fig . 1d and e , Supplementary Fig . S1c , and Supplementary Movie S3 and 4 ) . Consistent with this , ULK1 and Atg1 directly phosphorylated recombinant p62 ( 268 – 440 aa and 320 – 440 aa ) at Ser349 ( Fig . 1f ) . Although Ser403 was hardly phosphorylated ( Fig . 1f ) , it was also phosphorylated when mCherry - tagged full - length p62 was used ( Fig . 120 1f ) , indicating that the N - terminal PB1 domain of p62 is required for efficient Ser403 phosphorylation by ULK1 and Atg1 . These data suggest that ULK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates p62 . Localization of ULK1 in p62 bodies 125 p62 undergoes LLPS upon interaction with ubiquitinated proteins in vitro , forming p62 condensates 4 . We examined whether SNAP - Atg1 and SNAP - ULK1 associate with p62 condensates in vitro . Consistent with previous reports 4 , 5 , 15 , mixing mCherry - p62 with linear octa - ubiquitin ( 8xUb ) resulted in the formation of condensates ( Fig . 2a ) . Their size was increased by phosphomimetic p62 mutations ( S403E and S407E ) ( Fig . 2a ) that are known to 130 increase the binding affinity of p62 to ubiquitin 8 , 10 , 11 . SNAP - Atg1 and SNAP - ULK1 were Ikeda et al . , Page 6 recruited to p62 condensates when all were incubated together ( Fig . 2b ) , implying that both Atg1 and ULK1 associate with p62 even in the droplet form . We next studied the localization of ULK1 in Huh - 1 cells . Immunofluorescence analysis with an anti - ULK1 antibody showed the significant signal of ULK1 in p62 bodies , 135 which was diminished by ULK1 depletion ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Together with FIP200 , ATG13 , and ATG101 , ULK1 forms an initiation kinase complex for autophagosome formation 22 , and p62 interacts with FIP200 through the Claw domain 13 , raising the possibility that the localization of ULK1 to p62 bodies is indirect and depends on the interaction of p62 with FIP200 . To test this hypothesis , we developed FIP200 - deficient 140 Huh - 1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . Remarkably , we observed ULK1 localization to p62 bodies even in these cells , and ULK1 signal intensity was significantly higher than in wild - type Huh - 1 cells ( Fig . 2c ) , probably due to increased ULK1 protein in the FIP200 - knockout cells . Exogenously expressed green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged ULK1 and ULK2 also localized on p62 bodies regardless of the presence of FIP200 ( Fig . 2d ) . Correlative light and 145 electron microscopy with Huh - 1 cells harboring GFP - ULK1 revealed that GFP - ULK1 localizes on round structures composed of filamentous assemblies ; these structures were previously identified as p62 bodies 15 , 23 ( Fig . 2e ) . Taken together , these data suggest that ULK1 localizes in p62 bodies through the direct ULK1 - p62 interaction . 150 Significance of ULK1 within p62 bodies To investigate the significance of ULK1 and ULK2 within p62 bodies , we utilized MRT68921 , which is the most potent inhibitor of ULK1 and ULK2 , with IC 50 values of 2 . 9 nM and 1 . 1 nM , respectively 24 . As predicted , the treatment of Huh - 1 cells with MRT68921 decreased not only the level of phosphorylated ATG13 , but also those of the Ser349 - and 155 Ser403 - phosphorylated p62 forms ( Fig . 3a and Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . Similar results were obtained with ULK - 101 , another inhibitor of ULK1 and ULK2 25 ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . We observed extensive co - localization of the Ser403 - phosphorylated form in p62 bodies ( Fig . 3b ) . The signal intensity of Ser403 - phosphorylated p62 in p62 bodies became weaker when Huh - 1 cells were treated with MRT68921 ( Fig . 3b ) . MRT68921 treatment 160 slightly but significantly decreased both the size and number of p62 bodies ( Fig . 3b ) . These results suggest that while ULK1 and ULK2 contribute to the LLPS of p62 through the phosphorylation of Ser403 of p62 , the dephosphorylation of Ser403 within p62 bodies hardly have an effect on already formed p62 bodies . Next , we tested whether the inhibition of ULK1 and ULK2 affected KEAP1 - 165 localization within p62 bodies . Huh - 1 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of Ikeda et al . , Page 7 MRT68921 and immunostained with anti - p62 and anti - Ser349 - phosphorylated p62 - specific antibodies . The p62 bodies in Huh - 1 cells contained the Ser349 - phosphorylated form ( Fig . 3c ) . Upon exposure to MRT68921 , the signal intensities of phosphorylated p62 on p62 bodies markedly decreased ( Fig . 3c ) . Double immunofluorescence analysis with anti - p62 170 and anti - KEAP1 antibodies showed extensive localization of KEAP1 in the p62 bodies ( Fig . 3c ) . The signal intensity of KEAP1 in the bodies was significantly attenuated by treatment with MRT68921 ( Fig . 3c ) , suggesting release of KEAP1 from the bodies to the cytoplasm and subsequent NRF2 inactivation . Indeed , gene expression of NRF2 targets such as glutamate - cysteine ligase catalytic subunit ( GCLC ) , NAD ( P ) H quinone dehydrogenase 1 175 ( NQO1 ) , UDP - glucose 6 - dehydrogenase ( UGDH ) , superoxide dismutase 1 ( SOD1 ) , and p62 itself was decreased by MRT68921 treatment ( Fig . 3d ) . These data suggest that ULK1 and ULK2 in p62 bodies contribute to the activation of NRF2 by phosphorylating p62 at Ser349 and promoting sequestration of KEAP1 within p62 bodies . 180 Dynamics of KEPA1 in S349 - phosphorylated p62 bodies In the next series of experiments , we sought to determine whether Ser349 phosphorylation of p62 affects KEAP1 dynamics in p62 bodies . To do this , we generated p62 KEAP1 double - knockout Huh - 1 cells ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) and expressed GFP - tagged wild - type p62 , phosphomimetic p62 S349E 20 , phosphodefective p62 S349A 20 , or KEAP1 interaction - defective 185 p62 T350A 19 together with mCherry or mCherry - tagged KEAP1 . The fluorescence analysis revealed that in the absence of mCherry - KEAP1 , wild - type GFP - p62 and all GFP - p62 mutants formed round , liquid droplet - like structures ( Fig . 4a ) . When we coexpressed wild - type GFP - p62 or the mutants with mCherry - KEAP1 in the double knockout Huh - 1 cells , mCherry - KEAP1 co - localized well with GFP - p62 - positive structures except those composed 190 of GFP - p62 T350A ( Fig . 4a ) . We measured the circularity of each GFP - p62 - positive structure composed of wild - type p62 or the mutants in the presence or absence of mCherry - KEAP1 . Circularity values close to 1 were associated with liquid droplets , while lower values correlated with gels or aggregates 26 , 27 . In the absence of mCherry - KEAP1 , all GFP - p62 - positive structure values were close to 1 ( Fig . 4b ) , suggesting that they were liquid droplets . 195 Remarkably , the circularity of GFP - p62 S349E bodies but not others was significantly decreased when these bodies co - localized with mCherry - KEAP1 ( Fig . 4b ) . Further , in vitro LLPS assay revealed that introduction of the S349E mutation in p62 S403E S407E resulted in the formation of amorphous aggregates rather than liquid droplets , but only in the presence of KEAP1 ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . These data suggest that strong binding of 200 Ikeda et al . , Page 8 KEAP1 to p62 as a result of the S349E mutation changes the biophysical properties of p62 bodies . We hypothesized that once mCherry - KEAP1 was incorporated into S349 - phosphorylated p62 bodies , KEAP1 efflux from the bodies would be significantly reduced due to the close interaction between the phosphorylated p62 and KEAP1 . To prove this , we 205 used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) and fluorescence loss in photobleaching ( FLIP ) 28 to evaluate KEAP1 influx and efflux into p62 bodies consisting of GFP - p62 S349E or p62 S349A . To measure the influx of mCherry - KEAP1 into GFP - p62 bodies , the whole fluorescence of mCherry - KEAP1 in GFP - p62 S349E or p62 S349A bodies was photobleached , and the fluorescence recovery was measured . It is common to characterize 210 molecular dynamics in FRAP experiments by the half - time of recovery ( t50 ) and the mobile fraction 29 . Based on these parameters , the influx of mCherry - KEAP1 from the surrounding environment was comparable between p62 S349E and p62 S349A bodies ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Movies S5 and S6 ) . Next , to examine the efflux of mCherry - KEAP1 from GFP - p62 bodies , we carried out FLIP analysis . When approximately 80 % of the cellular 215 region is photobleached , the fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm is transiently reduced , followed by a gradual recovery due to influx from the non - bleached region . If there is an outflow of mCherry - KEAP1 from p62 bodies , the fluorescence intensity of mCherry - KEAP1 within p62 bodies in the non - bleached area should decrease after photobleaching . While the signal intensity of mCherry - KEAP1 in p62 S349A bodies decreased about to 58 . 2 ± 0 . 05 % of 220 the baseline value at 30 min after the photobleaching , it remained higher ( 72 . 0 ± 0 . 07 % ) in the case of p62 S349E bodies ( Fig . 4e and Supplementary Movies S7 and S8 ) . Finally , to investigate the inner fluidity of mCherry - KEAP1 in GFP - p62 bodies , we measured the fluorescence recovery of mCherry - KEAP1 after photobleaching of the central portion of GFP - p62 bodies . The t50 of mCherry - KEAP1 in p62 S349E bodies was 8 . 51 ± 4 . 83 min , which 225 was much slower than that seen with p62 S349A bodies ( 3 . 32 ± 1 . 23 min ) ( Fig . 4f and Supplementary Movie S9 and S10 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that Ser349 phosphorylation of p62 results in the retention of KEAP1 in p62 bodies , and when this sequestration is prolonged , the inner fluidity of these bodies is decreased . 230 Physiological significance of Ser349 phosphorylation of p62 in mice To clarify the physiological role of Ser349 phosphorylation of p62 in vivo , we generated knock - in mice that expressed p62 in which Ser351 ( corresponding to human Ser349 ) was replaced by Glu ( p62 S351E / + mice ) or Ala ( p62 S351A / + mice ) . Initially , we tried to use the CRISPR / Cas9 system to generate both knock - in mice , but could obtain only p62 S351A / + mice . 235 Ikeda et al . , Page 9 We therefore attempted to use prime editing , a recently developed system , to generate p62 S351E / + mice using mouse embryonic stem cells ( mES cells ) 30 . Even with this method , however , we were unable to obtain chimeric mice with high chimerism . We did succeed in generating a male chimeric mouse with low chimerism and germline transmission . In vitro fertilization using sperm from the chimeric mouse was performed to obtain a sufficient 240 number of heterozygotes for the experiments . The resulting p62 S351E / + mice showed severe growth retardation and mild hepatomegaly at P12 and P15 ( Fig . 5a - c ) , which is probably why knock - in mice could not be obtained by the above method . RNAseq analysis of wild - type and p62 S351E / + mouse livers demonstrated increased gene expression of NRF2 targets ( Fig . 5d ) . Consistent with these results , real - time PCR analysis showed that the gene 245 expression of NRF2 targets such as glutathione S - transferase Mu 1 ( Gstm1 ) , Nqo1 , Ugdh , and p62 was much higher in the liver of p62 S351E / + mice than in wild - type mice ( Fig . 5e ) . We also found that the levels of GSTM1 , NQO1 , and UGDH , and the nuclear level of NRF2 , were markedly higher in p62 S351E / + mice than in wild - type mice ( Fig . 5f ) . These results indicate that the expression of p62 S351E at half the level of endogenous p62 is sufficient for 250 KEAP1 inactivation and subsequent NRF2 activation in vivo . Anatomical analysis revealed that the forestomach wall of p62 S351E / + mice was obviously thickened compared with that of wild - type mice ( Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . Hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) staining indicated that the esophagus and forestomach of p62 S351E / + mice had a remarkably thicker stratum corneum than those of wild - type mice , but such differences were not observed in the skin ( Fig . 5g ) . In 255 the forestomach , the epithelial layers below the stratum corneum were slightly thicker in p62 S351E / + mice than in wild - type mice , but this was not evident in the esophagus . Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) revealed that in the epithelia of the esophagus and forestomach , the intensity of NQO1 was higher in p62 S351E / + mice than in wild - type mice ( Fig . 5h ) . The staining of the cell proliferation marker Ki - 67 showed no significant 260 difference between mutant and wild - type organs ( data not shown ) . Serum data from p62 S351E / + mice indicated a slightly but significantly elevated aspartate aminotransferase level , signs of malnutrition ( low blood glucose and high cholesterol ) , and signs of dehydration ( increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ) ( Fig . 5i ) . These results strongly suggested that p62 S351E / + mice are a phenocopy of Keap1 - deficient mice 31 , and that impaired 265 nutritional intake due to hyperkeratosis in the esophagus and forestomach could be the primary cause of the severe phenotype of p62 S351E / + mice . In striking contrast to these mice , p62 S351A / + and p62 S351A / S351A mice were fertile and showed no obvious growth retardation ( Supplementary Fig . S7a - c ) . Morphological and biochemical analyses indicated no differences in phenotypes ( including NRF2 activation ) between wild - type and p62 S351A / S351A 270 Ikeda et al . , Page 10 mice ( Supplementary Fig . S7d - g ) , implying that Ser351 phosphorylation of p62 is unnecessary for mouse development and survival . Taken together , these results indicate that Ser351 phosphorylation of p62 is physiologically important for the control of NRF2 activity in vivo , most likely by regulating the redox - independent KEAP1 - NRF2 pathway . 275 Discussion The ULK1 kinase complex functions as the most upstream factor for autophagosome formation 22 , 32 . In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , nutrient deprivation causes phosphatase - induced dephosphorylation of Atg13 , which results in the formation of higher - order structures of the Atg1 kinase complex ( the ULK1 kinase complex in mammals ) and 280 subsequently the formation of a liquid - droplet , pre - autophagosomal structure 33 , 34 . Nutrient starvation activates the ULK1 kinase complex , which phosphorylates ATG proteins , including Beclin 1 35 , ATG14 36 , 37 , and ATG9 38 , and contributes to the initiation of autophagosome formation 22 , 32 . On the other hand , ULK1 phosphorylates substrates that are not directly involved in autophagosome formation , such as SEC16A 39 , glycolytic enzymes 40 , 285 and STING 41 . p62 is also in this category , and it is closely involved in the LLPS , the p62 body formation 42 . In this study , we showed that ULK1 localized to p62 bodies ( Fig . 2 ) and phosphorylated Ser349 of p62 ( Fig . 1 ) , the latter of which is required for KEAP1 localization and retention to p62 bodies and subsequent NRF2 activation ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . Thus , ULK1 modulates the formation and degradation of p62 bodies and also plays a role in the 290 antioxidative - stress response . When does ULK1 phosphorylate p62 ? Since ULK1 was localized in p62 bodies both in vitro and in vivo ( Fig . 2 ) , it is plausible that ULK1 phosphorylates Ser349 of p62 located in p62 bodies . Indeed , we hardly observed phosphorylation of the p62 K7A D69A mutant , which is not capable of LLPS ( data not shown ) . How does ULK1 recognize p62 bodies ? Our HS - 295 AFM showed that the p62 homodimer directly bound to ULK1 via dynamic IDR - IDR and IDR - globular domain interactions ( Fig . 1f ) . It is known that IDRs specifically interact with multiple target molecules through a binding mode called " coupled folding and binding " 43 . This binding mode may facilitate conformational changes and phosphorylation of large numbers of p62 molecules in p62 bodies , because substitutions between IDRs that bind to 300 target molecules occur very rapidly 44 . With the phosphomimetic p62 mutant p62 S349E , influx of KEAP1 into p62 bodies predominated over efflux ( Fig . 4d and e ) . The coexpression of p62 S349E and KEAP1 in p62 KEAP1 double - knockout Huh - 1 cells reduced the circularity of p62 bodies compared to the expression of p62 S349E alone ( Fig . 4a and b ) , and also decreased the fluidity of KEAP1 molecules within p62 bodies ( Fig . 4f ) . When the sequestration of 305 Ikeda et al . , Page 11 KEAP1 within p62 bodies surpasses a certain threshold level , these bodies convert from liquid - like to gel - like droplets . What does this mean ? Since autophagy is known to target gel - like rather than liquid - like droplets 15 , 45 , 46 , it is possible that incorporation of a certain number of KEAP1 molecules into p62 bodies changes them into gel - like aggregates and enhances autophagic degradation . This is consistent with two findings : adding KEAP1 to 310 p62 condensates consisting of p62 S349E resulted in amorphous aggregates in vitro ( Fig . 4c ) , and p62 S351E / + mice had reduced levels of not only Ser403 - phosphorylated p62 representing p62 bodies but also KEAP1 ( Fig . 5f ) . Once p62 bodies are degraded by autophagy , the interaction between Ser349 - phosphorylated p62 and KEAP1 should be suppressed because Ser349 phosphorylation of p62 occurs mainly in p62 bodies . As a result , KEAP1 remains in 315 the cytoplasm , and NRF2 is degraded . In other words , the retention of KEAP1 in p62 bodies above a threshold level is thought to suppress NRF2 activation in a feedback regulation process . Nrf2 - / - mice grow normally and are fertile 47 , though they are susceptible to oxidative stress and reactive electrophiles 17 . In addition , they show tooth decolorization due to 320 defective iron transport in the enamel 48 , which makes them easily distinguishable from wild - type and heterozygous mice . p62 S351A / S351A , the phosphodefective p62 knock - in mice in which p62 - mediated NRF2 activation should be impaired , were also fertile and did not differ from wild - type mice for 1 year , at least under specific pathogen - free conditions ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . However , their incisors were brownish - yellow , in contrast to the greyish white 325 incisors in Nrf2 - deficient mice ( data not shown ) , indicating that p62 S351A / S351A mice retain NRF2 activity . p62 - mediated NRF2 activation was not required for development or survival , at least under steady - state conditions . The redox - independent antioxidative stress response might have an anti - aging effect since p62 bodies are thought to increase when the activities of both autophagy - lysosomes and the ubiquitin - proteasome system decrease with aging . 330 Further research is needed to determine whether the redox - independent stress response is activated with aging , and if so , which tissues are affected . In sharp contrast to p62 S351A / S351A mice , the phosphomimetic p62 knock - in mice p62 S351E / + , in which p62 - mediated NRF2 activation is persistently activated , showed severe phenotypes . The mice had impaired nutritional intake due to hyperkeratosis in the esophagus 335 and forestomach , which led to malnutrition and dehydration ( Fig . 5 ) . This represented almost a phenocopy of Keap1 - deficient mice , which exhibit hyperactivation of NRF2 and show hyperkeratosis in the esophagus and forestomach 31 . One difference is that p62 S351E / + mice do not develop skin hyperkeratosis , which is observed in Keap1 - knockout mice 31 . Why does constant activation of NRF2 , which has an inherently cytoprotective role , cause a severe 340 Ikeda et al . , Page 12 phenotype ? The esophagus and stomach are exposed to a variety of toxic foods and drinks . This may cause wounds that require NRF2 for healing , and a redox - independent p62 - mediated pathway may be at work . Meanwhile , the healing of skin wounds may be mediated by redox - dependent NRF2 activation 49 . It is plausible that transient activation of NRF2 in response to toxicity , whether redox - dependent or redox - independent , is important for 345 biological defense , and that persistent activation leads to excessive defense responses ( e . g . , excessive keratinization ) . In the case of redox - independent stress response , the transient activation would be regulated by phosphorylation , dephosphorylation , and autophagic degradation of p62 body . In conclusion , we showed for first time that the redox - independent NRF2 activation 350 pathway , which is mediated by p62 bodies and their phosphorylation , is physiologically important . Methods Cell culture 355 Huh - 1 cells ( JCRB0199 , NIBIOHN ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum , 5 U / mL penicillin , and 50 μg / mL streptomycin . For overexpression experiments , Huh - 1 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( L3000015 , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Huh - 1 cells were authenticated using the STR profile and tested for mycoplasma contamination . 360 Mice To generate p62 S351A knock - in mice , CRISPR RNA ( crRNA ) was designed to recognize the target site ( 5’ - ACTGGAGTTCACCTGTAGAT - 3’ ) . The synthetic crRNAs ( Alt - R CRISPR - Cas9 crRNA ) , trans - activating CRISPR RNA ( tracrRNA ) ( Alt - R CRISPR - Cas9 tracrRNA ) , 365 and Cas9 protein ( Alt - R S . p . Cas9 Nuclease V3 ) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies , Inc . ( IDT ; Coralville , IA , USA ) . The 120 - mer single - stranded oligodeoxynucleotide ( ssODN ) carrying the intended base substitutions ( TCT to GCC ) was synthesized by Eurofins Genomics K . K . ( Tokyo , Japan ) . The CRISPR / Cas9 solution was prepared as previously described 50 , with minor modifications . Briefly , lyophilized crRNAs 370 and tracrRNA were resuspended in nuclease - free duplex buffer ( IDT ) to a concentration of 240 μM . Equal volumes of crRNA and tracrRNA were combined , heated at 95°C for 5 min , and then placed in room temperature ( RT ) for about 10 min to allow formation of crRNA - tracrRNA duplex . Lyophilized ssODN was resuspended in nuclease - free water to a concentration of 4 mg / mL . crRNA - tracrRNA duplex was mixed with Cas9 protein to form a 375 Ikeda et al . , Page 13 ribonucleoprotein complex , and then mixed with ssODN in Opti - MEM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The final concentrations of Cas9 protein , crRNA - tracrRNA duplex , and ssODN were 1 μg / mL , 30 μM , and 1mg / mL , respectively . To induce CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated mutation , we applied a method called improved genome editing via oviductal nucleic acid delivery ( i - GONAD ) 50 . Approximately 1 . 5 mL of CRISPR / Cas9 solution was injected into 380 the oviductal lumens of female C57BL / 6N mice on day 0 . 7 of pregnancy . Immediately after the injection , the oviduct regions were grasped with a tweezer - type electrode ( catalog no . CUY652 - 3 ; Nepa Gene Co . , Ltd . , Chiba , Japan ) and then electroporated using the NEPA21 square - wave pulse generator ( Nepa Gene ) . The electroporation parameters used were previously described 50 . Pregnant female mice were allowed to deliver their pups . Biopsies of 385 pup tails were performed for genomic DNA isolation , and mutations were validated by sequencing of PCR products amplified from genomic DNAs . To generate p62 S351E knock - in mice using mouse embryonic stem ( mES ) cells , we applied the recently developed prime editing system 30 . Details of the methods for establishment of edited mES cells will be published elsewhere ( Manabu Abe , et al ) . Briefly , 390 we designed prime - editing guide RNA ( pegRNA ) containing the following sequences : spacer sequence , 5’ - GACUGGAGUUCACCUGUAGA - 3’ ; reverse transcription template , 5’ - GUGGACCCAGAG - 3’ ; primer - binding site , 5’ - ACAGGUGAACUCC - 3’ . The CAG promoter - driven prime editor 2 ( PE2 ) and the U6 promoter - driven pegRNA expression vectors were originally constructed using pCMV - PE2 - P2A - GFP ( # 132776 , Addgene ) and 395 the hU6 - sgRNA plasmid 51 . These vectors were co - transfected into RENKA4 , a C57BL / 6N - derived mES cell line , using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Knock - in mutations in transfected mES clones were validated by sequencing of PCR products amplified from genomic DNAs . Culture of mES cells and generation of chimeric mice were carried out as previously described 52 . 400 Purification of recombinant protein mCherry - p62 , mCherry - p62 mutants , SNAP - KEAP1 , and SNAP - 8xUb were prepared as described previously 15 . The gene encoding 8xUb was purchased from GenScript , New Jersey , USA . Purified proteins were stored at −80 °C until use . 405 Recombinant SNAP - Atg1 proteins were prepared as described previously 34 . To construct the expression plasmid encoding TwinStrep - CS - SNAP - ULK1 - His6 ( CS ; HRV 3C protease recognition site ) , the genes and pCAG - neo vector ( FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation ) were amplified by PCR . The PCR fragments were assembled using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix ( New England BioLabs ( NEB ) , Ipswich , MA ) . The 410 Ikeda et al . , Page 14 construct was subjected to sequencing analysis to confirm its identity and transfected into Expi293 GnTI − cells using Screen F ect™ UP - 293 ( FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation ) . The cells were collected after 5 days and sonicated in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 8 . 0 ] , 300 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % glycerol , 1 mM TCEP , 1x protease inhibitor cocktail ( Nacalai Tesque , Kyoto , Japan ) ) on ice and centrifuged 415 at 16 , 000 g for 40 min at 4 °C . The supernatant was purified with a Strep - Tactin®XT resin column ( IBA Lifesciences Göttingen , Germany ) . The protein was eluted with 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM NaCl , 50 mM biotin and concentrated using Vivaspin 500 ( Cytiva , Massachusetts , USA ) . 420 HS - AFM The procedure for HS - AFM observation was described previously 53 . HS - AFM images were acquired in tapping mode using a sample - scanning HS - AFM instrument ( MS - NEX , Research Institute of Biomolecule Metrology Co . , Ltd . , Ibaraki , Japan ) . We used cantilevers measuring ~ 7 µm long , ~ 2 µm wide , and ~ 0 . 08 µm thick with electron beam - deposited 425 ( EBD ) tips ( tip radius < 10 nm ) ( USC - F1 . 2 - k0 . 15 , NanoWorld , Neuchâtel , Switzerland ) . Their resonant frequency and spring constant were 1 . 2 MHz in air and 0 . 15 N / m , respectively . Imaging conditions were as follows : scan size , 120 × 120 nm 2 ( Fig . 2f , Fig . S3a , b ) or 150 × 150 nm 2 ( Fig . S3c ) ; pixel size , 100 × 100 pixels ( Fig . 2f , Fig . S3a - c ) ; imaging rate , 8 . 33 frames / sec ( Fig . 2f , Fig . S3a ) or 6 . 67 frames / s ( Fig . S3b , c ) . Imaging was 430 performed at 23 °C . HS - AFM images were viewed and analyzed using the Kodec4 . 4 . 7 . 39 54 and ImageJ software systems . Sample preparation for HS - AFM imaging For imaging of SNAP - ULK1 and p62 _ 268 – 440 , SNAP - ULK1 ( 50 nM ) or p62 _ 268 – 440 ( 10 435 nM ) was deposited onto freshly cleaved mica glued to the top of a glass stage ( diameter , 1 . 5 mm ; height , 2 mm ) . After incubation for 3 – 5 min , the mica was rinsed and immersed in the liquid cell containing ~ 90 μL of imaging buffer A ( 20 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES - NaOH [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP ) or imaging buffer B ( 20 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES - NaOH [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 1 mM MgCl 2 ) , respectively .

The mixed protein solution was deposited onto freshly cleaved mica and incubated for 3 – 5 min . After rinsing with imaging buffer A , the mica was immersed in ~ 90 μL of imaging buffer A . 445 Ikeda et al . , Page 15 In vitro kinase assay Purified p62 ( 268 – 440aa ) , p62 ( 320 – 440aa ) or mCherry - p62 was incubated with purified SNAP - Atg1 or SNAP - ULK1 in kinase buffer ( 20 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM DTT ) containing 200 μM of ATP per reaction for 30 min at 37 °C . The reaction was terminated by adding LDS sample buffer ( NP0007 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) 450 and subjected to SDS - PAGE followed by immunoblot analyses with p62 Ser349 - 20 , Ser403 - ( GTX128171 , GeneTex ) , and Ser407 - 8 specific antibodies . In vitro LLPS assay For the in vitro LLPS assay , fluorescence observation was performed on glass - bottom dishes 455 ( MatTek , Massachusetts , USA ) coated with 0 . 3 % ( w / v ) bovine serum albumin using an FV3000RS confocal laser - scanning microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . Lasers with wavelengths of 488 , 561 , and 640 nm were used for excitation of Alexa Fluor 488 , mCherry , and Alexa Fluor 649 , respectively . To observe p62 - 8xUb condensates , mCherry - p62 wild - type ( WT ) or mCherry - p62 mutant was mixed with SNAP ( 649 ) - 8xUb ( SNAP - 8xUb labeled 460 with SNAP - Surface 649 ) . Each final protein concentration was 10 μ M . To observe p62 - 8xUb condensates in the presence of ATG1 or ULK1 , SNAP ( 488 ) - ATG1 or SNAP ( 488 ) - ULK1 ( SNAP - ATG1 / ULK1 labeled with SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 488 ) was premixed with mCherry - p62WT / p62S403 _ S407E before mixing with SNAP ( 649 ) - 8xUb . The final concentrations of SNAP ( 488 ) - Atg1 / ULK1 , SNAP ( 649 ) - 8xUb , and mCherry - p62WT / 465 p62S403E _ S407E were 0 . 2 μ M , 10 μ M , and 10 μ M , respectively . To observe p62 - 8xUb condensates in the presence of KEAP1 , SNAP ( 488 ) - KEAP1 ( SNAP - KEAP1 labeled with SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 488 ) was premixed with mCherry - p62 mutant before mixing with SNAP ( 649 ) - 8xUb . The final concentrations of SNAP ( 488 ) - KEAP1 , SNAP ( 649 ) - 8xUb , and mCherry - p62 mutants were 5 μ M , 10 μ M , and 10 μ M , respectively . The buffer solutions 470 used for the in vitro LLPS assay were 200 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES - NaOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 10 % glycerol , and 1 mM TCEP . Each mixed solution was incubated for 50 min at ~ 23 °C before imaging . The % area of p62 condensates ( the sum of the areas of p62 condensates divided by the total area ( 106 . 7 μ m × 106 . 7 μ m ) ) ( Fig . 2a ) was calculated using the “analyze particles” 475 tool of ImageJ software . Statistical analysis was performed by Welch’s t - test . Immunoblot analysis Cells were lysed in ice - cold TNE buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl [ pH 7 . 5 ] , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA ) containing 1 % Triton X - 100 and cOmplete EDTA - free protease inhibitor cocktail 480 Ikeda et al . , Page 16 ( 5056489001 , Roche ) . After centrifugation twice at 15 , 000 g for 10 min , the supernatant was collected as the cell lysates . Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid ( BCA ) protein assay ( 23225 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The lysate was boiled in LDS sample buffer , and the samples were separated by SDS - PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes .

Cells were imaged using the FV1000 520 confocal laser - scanning microscope with FV10 - ASW 04 . 01 ( Olympus ) and a UPlanSApo ×60 NA 1 . 40 oil objective lens . Contrast and brightness of images were adjusted using Photoshop 2021v25 . 0 ( Adobe , California , USA ) . The number , size , and circularity of p62 - positive punctae in each cell and the mean fluorescence intensity of each signal on p62 - positive punctae were quantified using a Benchtop High - Content Analysis System ( CQ1 , 525 Yokogawa Electric Corp . , Tokyo , Japan ) and CellPathfinder software ( Yokogawa Electric Corp . ) . Correlative light and electron microscopic analysis Huh - 1 cells on coverslips etched with 150 - µm grids ( CS01885 , Matsunami Glass Ind . Osaka , 530 Japan ) were transfected with pMRX - IP - GFP - ULK1 or pMRX - IP - GFP - ULK2 . After 24 h , cells were fixed with 2 % PFA – 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde ( GA ) in 0 . 1 M PB ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Then , phase - contrast and fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal microscope ( FV1000 ) . After image acquisition , the cells were fixed again with 2 % PFA and 2 % GA in 0 . 1 M PB ( pH 7 . 4 ) , processed according to the reduced - osmium method 55 , and embedded in 535 Epon812 . Areas containing cells of interest were trimmed , cut as serial 80 - nm sections , and observed using an electron microscope ( EM ; JEM1400 ; JEOL ) . Light microscopy and EM images were aligned according to three p62 bodies using Photoshop CS6 ( Adobe ) . Histological analyses 540 Mouse livers were excised , cut into small pieces , and fixed by immersion in 4 % PFA – 4 % sucrose in 0 . 1 M PB , pH 7 . 4 . After rinsing , they were embedded in paraffin for immunostaining . Paraffin sections of 3 - µm thickness were prepared and processed for HE staining or IHC . For IHC , antigen retrieval was performed for 20 min at 98 ˚C using a microwave processor ( MI - 77 , AZUMAYA , Japan ) in 1 % immunosaver ( Nissin EM , Japan ) . 545 Sections were blocked and incubated for 2 days at 4 ˚C with the following primary antibodies : rabbit polyclonal antibody against NQO1 ( Abcam ) , followed by N - Histofine simple stain mouse MAX PO kit ( NICHIREI BIOSCIENCES , Tokyo , Japan ) using 3 , 39 - diaminobenzidine . Images of the stained specimens were acquired with a microscope ( BX51 , Olympus ) equipped with a cooled CCD camera system ( DP - 71 , Olympus ) . 550 Ikeda et al . , Page 18 FRAP and FLIP assays p62 / KEAP1 double - knockout Huh - 1 cells expressing GFP - p62 S349E or GFP - p62 S349A in a doxycycline treatment - dependent manner were generated using a reverse tet - regulated retroviral vector , as previously reported . To induce the expression of GFP - p62 S349E or GFP - 555 p62 S349A , the cells were treated with 50 ng / mL of doxycycline ( Dox , Sigma - Aldrich ) for 24 h . Thereafter , mCherry - KEAP1 was transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and cultured for 24 h . In FRAP assays , GFP - p62 bodies that were positive for mCherry - KEAP1 were bleached using a laser intensity of 10 % at 488 nm , and then the fluorescence recovery of mCherry was recorded . In FLIP assays , almost 80 % of the total cell 560 area was set as the region of interest for photobleaching ( excitation output level : 10 % at 561 nm ; iterations : 3 – 5 ) using FV31S - SW software ( Olympus ) , and then the fluorescence loss of mCherry - KEAP1 in GFP - p62 S349E or GFP - p62 S349A bodies was recorded . The fluorescence intensity of mCherry - KEAP1 within the p62 bodies in the photobleaching area recovered to 32 % at 15 min after photobleaching and reached equilibrium . Therefore , the fluorescence 565 intensity of mCherry - KEAP1 within the p62 bodies in the non - photobleaching area was measured at 30 min after fluorescence loss . Olympus FV31S - SW software ( version : 2 . 4 . 1 . 198 ) and cellSens Dimension Desktop 3 . 2 ( Build 23706 ) was used for image collection and analysis . The mobile fraction was calculated from 10 measurements by the following equation : Mf = ( F∞−F0 ) / ( Fi−F0 ) , where Mf is the mobile fraction , F∞ is the fluorescence 570 intensity after full recovery ( plateau ) , Fi is the initial fluorescence intensity prior to bleaching , and F0 is the fluorescence intensity immediately after bleaching .
