Tropomyosins are coiled - coil dimers that form head - to - tail polymers along actin ﬁlaments and regu - late interactions of other proteins , including actin - de - polymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlins and myosins , with actin [ 2 – 5 ] . In mammals , > 40 tropomyosin isoforms can be generated through alternative splicing from four tropomyosin genes . Different isoforms display non - redundant functions and partially non - overlap - ping localization patterns , for example within the stress ﬁber network [ 6 , 7 ] . Based on cell biological studies , it was thus proposed that tropomyosin isoforms may specify the functional properties of different actin ﬁlament populations [ 2 ] . To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the properties of actin ﬁlaments decorated by stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosins ( Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm1 . 7 , Tpm2 . 1 , Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 , and Tpm4 . 2 ) . These proteins bound F - actin with high afﬁnity and competed with a - actinin for actin ﬁlament binding . Importantly , total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy of ﬂuores - cently tagged proteins revealed that most tropomy - osin isoforms cannot co - polymerize with each other on actin ﬁlaments . These isoforms also bind actin with different dynamics , which correlate with their effects on actin - binding proteins . The long isoforms Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 displayed stable interactions with actin ﬁlaments and protected ﬁlaments from ADF / coﬁlin - mediated disassembly , but did not acti - vate non - muscle myosin IIa ( NMIIa ) . In contrast , the short isoforms Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 , and Tpm4 . 2 dis - played rapid dynamics on actin ﬁlaments and stimu - lated the ATPase activity of NMIIa , but did not efﬁ - ciently protect ﬁlaments from ADF / coﬁlin . Together , these data provide experimental evidence that tropomyosin isoforms segregate to different actin ﬁlaments and specify functional properties of distinct actin ﬁlament populations . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Actin ﬁlaments assemble into diverse three - dimensional arrays to execute a wide variety of processes in eukaryotic cells . These actin ﬁlament arrays are characterized by distinct protein com - positions and dynamic properties , but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood [ 1 , 8 ] . To elucidate the principles by which functionally distinct actin ﬁlament popu - lations can be generated in cells , we focused on analyzing stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosin isoforms . Stress ﬁbers are contractile actomyosin bundles that contribute to cell morpho - genesis , adhesion , migration , and mechanosensing [ 9 ] . Stress ﬁber assembly depends on several proteins promoting actin ﬁla - ment nucleation and polymerization , and different stress ﬁber types are decorated by partially non - overlapping sets of actin - binding proteins [ 7 , 10 – 14 ] . Six tropomyosin isoforms ( Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm1 . 7 , Tpm2 . 1 , Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 , and Tpm4 . 2 ) associate with stress ﬁbers in osteosarcoma cells ( Figures 1A and 1B ; Fig - ure S1A ) . Importantly , these isoforms display partially different localization patterns along stress ﬁbers and , based on RNAi ex - periments , are functionally non - redundant [ 7 ] . Therefore , they may specify functionally distinct actin ﬁlament populations within the stress ﬁber network . However , whether distinct tropomyosin isoforms indeed segregate to different actin ﬁlaments has not been experimentally demonstrated . Moreover , the biochemical properties of actin ﬁlaments decorated by different tropomyosin isoforms have not been systematically studied . To examine the six stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosin iso - forms , we expressed and puriﬁed them as non - tagged versions and as superfolder GFP ( sfGFP ) - or mCherry - fusion proteins . In all cases , an alanine - serine extension was introduced to mimic amino - terminal acetylation [ 15 ] . In the ﬂuorescent fusion pro - teins , sfGFP / mCherry was linked to the N termini of the tropomy - osins because such fusion proteins localize properly to the stress ﬁber network in cells and can rescue the knockout phenotype ( Figure S1B ) [ 7 ] . Moreover , a recent biochemical study demon - strated that an amino - terminal S . pombe tropomyosin ﬂuores - cent fusion binds actin ﬁlaments and forms similar end - to - end interactions compared to endogenous acetylated tropomyosin Current Biology 27 , 705 – 713 , March 6 , 2017 ª 2017 The Author ( s ) .

The actin ﬁlament co - sedimentation assay was ﬁrst applied to examine the binding of non - tagged and sfGFP - tagged tropo - myosins to non - muscle b / g - actin ﬁlaments . Consistent with earlier work [ 17 ] , the stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosins bound b / g - actin ﬁlaments with high afﬁnity ( K d < 1 m M ) and the N - terminal sfGFP fusion did not interfere with F - actin binding ( Figure 1C ; Figure S1C ) . This was also supported by in vitro total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy experiments demonstrating that the ﬂuorescent fusions of tropomyosins decorated non - labeled b / g - actin ﬁlaments . However , tropomyo - sins do not efﬁciently interact with rhodamine - labeled actin , because tropomyosins and rhodamine - actin segregated on ﬁla - ments in experiments where only a small fraction ( 5 % ) of actin monomers was labeled ( Figure S1D ) . Whereas sfGFP fusions of Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm1 . 7 , Tpm2 . 1 , Tpm3 . 1 , and Tpm3 . 2 interacted strongly with individual actin ﬁlaments in the TIRF microscopy assay , sfGFP - Tpm4 . 2 bound only to actin ﬁlament bundles , induced either by methylcellulose or myosin II , with high afﬁnity ( Figures S2A and S2B ; data not shown ) . Mechanistic principles by which Tpm4 . 2 preferentially interacts with actin ﬁlament bun - dles ( at least in our TIRF setup ) remain to be elucidated . A simple interpretation is that , unlike the other tropomyosins , Tpm4 . 2 promotes ﬁlament bundling and only interacts strongly with actin ﬁlaments that are bundled . This property may be linked to its cellular function in myosin II recruitment to stress ﬁbers [ 7 ] . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) was applied to examine the dynamics of stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosins on actin ﬁlaments . The assay was ﬁrst performed on individual actin ﬁlaments with Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm1 . 7 , Tpm2 . 1 , Tpm3 . 1 , and Tpm3 . 2 . Interestingly , sfGFP fusions of Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm1 . 7 , and Tpm2 . 1 displayed only very slow recovery on bleached actin ﬁlament segments , whereas the ﬂuorescence re - covery of sfGFP fusions of Tpm3 . 1 and Tpm3 . 2 on actin ﬁla - ments was relatively rapid ( Figures 1D and 1E ) . Because Tpm4 . 2 does not bind individual actin ﬁlaments with high afﬁnity , the FRAP assay was also performed on actin ﬁlament bundles induced by methylcellulose . To conﬁrm that we indeed measured the dynamics of actin - ﬁlament - associated tropomyo - sins , samples were spiked with 5 % rhodamine - labeled actin to visualize the ﬁlament bundles . Importantly , sfGFP - Tpm4 . 2 displayed similar rapid recovery on actin ﬁlament bundles compared to sfGFP - Tpm3 . 1 and sfGFP - Tpm3 . 2 , whereas the ﬂuorescence recoveries of sfGFP - Tpm1 . 6 , sfGFP - Tpm1 . 7 , and sfGFP - Tpm2 . 1 were very slow , further conﬁrming the differences in the dynamics of actin ﬁlament association between these tropomyosins ( Figures S2C and S2D ) . Together , these data reveal that the long stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosin iso - forms derived from the Tpm1 and Tpm2 genes display stable as - sociation with actin ﬁlaments , whereas the short isoforms derived from the Tpm3 and Tpm4 genes display dynamic asso - ciation with actin ﬁlaments . This correlates with the stronger co - operativity of actin binding observed with long tropomyosins compared with short isoforms [ 17 ] . We next asked whether the spatial segregation of tropomyosin isoforms is an intrinsic property of the tropomyosin proteins . To test this , we examined whether different tropomyosin isoforms , when incubated in combination with each other and actin ﬁla - ments , bind to same ﬁlaments or whether they segregate into different actin ﬁlaments or ﬁlament segments . Control experi - ments performed with sfGFP and mCherry fusions of the same tropomyosin isoform demonstrated that the two proteins with different ﬂuorescent tags do not segregate along actin ﬁlaments . This indicates that the N - terminal ﬂuorescent fusions do not alter the ability of tropomyosins to form end - to - end oligomers . Please note that the number of tropomyosin - decorated actin ﬁlaments appeared to differ in the case of distinct tropomyosin isoforms . This may arise from differences in the cooperativity of actin ﬁla - ment association between these tropomyosin isoforms . Impor - tantly , when sfGFP and mCherry fusions of different tropomyosin isoforms were co - incubated with actin , the two proteins often segregated into different segments along the actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 2A ; Figure S3 ) . Quantiﬁcation of co - localization indices of different tropomyosin pairs provided evidence that whereas the tropomyosin isoforms generated from the same gene ( Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 as well as Tpm3 . 1 and Tpm3 . 2 ) can co - polymerize on actin ﬁlaments , the isoforms generated from different tropomyosin genes are generally not capable of co - polymerizing on actin ﬁlaments and thus form segments along the ﬁlaments . The only exception was Tpm2 . 1 , which appeared to be able to co - polymerize with Tpm3 . 1 and Tpm3 . 2 but not with Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 ( Figure 2B ) . These data provide evidence that different tropomyosin isoforms can segregate into different actin ﬁlaments / ﬁlament segments and are capable of generating actin ﬁlament populations that are decorated by a speciﬁc tropo - myosin isoform or a speciﬁc combination of tropomyosin isoforms . Do actin ﬁlaments decorated by different tropomyosin iso - forms display functional differences ? We ﬁrst approached this question by examining the effects of stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosins on coﬁlin , because these two proteins have been shown to compete for F - actin binding both in vitro and in cells [ 5 , 18 – 20 ] . The only exception reported so far is Tpm1 . 2 , Figure 1 .

Current Biology 27 , 705 – 713 , March 6 , 2017 707 which , based on cell biological work , can associate with actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin on actin ﬁlaments [ 6 ] . Co - sedimentation assays and in vitro TIRF microscopy demon - strated that all stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosin isoforms compete with coﬁlin for F - actin binding , and that the two proteins interact with ﬁlaments in a mutually exclusive manner ( Figure 3A ; Figure S4 ; data not shown ) . Dual - color TIRF microscopy movies also demonstrated that in most cases , mCherry - coﬁlin clusters grew co - operatively along actin ﬁlaments toward the pointed end , simultaneously replacing sfGFP - tropomyosin from ﬁla - ments ( Figure 3B ; Movie S1 ) . These data are in agreement with recent high - speed atomic force microscopy work proposing that coﬁlin induces a unidirectional conformational change in actin ﬁlaments toward the pointed end of the coﬁlin - decorated segment , thus promoting the growth of a coﬁlin cluster toward the ﬁlament pointed end [ 21 ] . Coﬁlin did not induce frequent severing of tropomyosin - decorated actin ﬁlaments in our TIRF setup because non - labeled b / g - actin was used in our study , and severing events of bare ﬁlament segments could not be visu - alized . Thus , we examined the effects of tropomyosins on coﬁlin - mediated actin ﬁlament turnover by monitoring the decrease of pyrene - actin ﬂuorescence resulting from ﬁlament disassembly in the presence of coﬁlin and vitamin D - binding protein ( DBP ) [ 22 ] . Interestingly , the tropomyosin isoforms tested here had very different effects on actin ﬁlament disassembly by coﬁlin . Tpm2 . 1 , Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 , and Tpm4 . 2 were relatively inefﬁcient in protecting actin ﬁlaments from coﬁlin , and only two isoforms , Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 , efﬁciently protected actin ﬁlaments from coﬁlin - mediated disassembly ( Figure 3C ) . This is consistent with the TIRF assays , suggesting that although all tropomyosins compete with coﬁlin for actin binding , Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 were the most efﬁcient isoforms in competing with coﬁlin ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . Similar to the non - tagged tropomyosins , also sfGFP - Tpm1 . 6 and sfGFP - Tpm1 . 7 protected actin ﬁlaments from coﬁlin more efﬁciently compared to other isoforms ( Figure S4C ) . Tropomyosins and an actin ﬁlament cross - linking protein , a - actinin , display typically mutually exclusive localizations in contractile actin ﬁlament structures such as myoﬁbrils and stress ﬁbers . However , Tpm1 . 6 co - localizes , at a light microscopy level , with a - actinin in the non - contractile dorsal stress ﬁbers of migrating cells [ 7 ] . Thus , we performed actin ﬁlament co - sedi - mentation assays to test whether the stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosins compete with non - muscle a - actinin - 1 for actin ﬁlament binding in vitro . In these assays , actin ﬁlaments were pre - incubated with tropomyosins , and the ability of a - actinin to subsequently replace tropomyosins from ﬁlaments was exam - ined . The amount of all tropomyosin isoforms on actin ﬁlaments decreased in a concentration - dependent manner after addi - tion of a - actinin - 1 , suggesting that all stress - ﬁber - associated A B Figure 2 .

The concentrations of sfGFP and mCherry fusions of tropomyosins were 150 – 360 nM and 300 nM – 1 . 4 m M , respectively ( sfGFP - Tpm1 . 6 , 150 nM ; sfGFP - Tpm1 . 7 , 150 nM ; sfGFP - Tpm2 . 1 , 150 nM ; sfGFP - Tpm3 . 1 , 360 nM ; sfGFP - Tpm3 . 2 , 360 nM ; mCherry - Tpm1 . 6 , 300 nM ; mCherry - Tpm1 . 7 , 300 nM ; mCherry - Tpm2 . 1 , 1 . 4 m M ; mCherry - Tpm3 . 1 , 800 nM ; mCherry - Tpm3 . 2 , 800 nM ) .

The order in which the proteins were added on actin ﬁlaments did not affect their competition , because similar displacement was also observed when actin ﬁlaments were ﬁrst incubated with a - actinin - 1 before addition of tropomyosins ( data not shown ) . Based on cryo - elec - tron microscopy work , the binding sites of a - actinin and tropo - myosins on actin do not overlap [ 3 , 23 ] , and thus the molecular mechanism of competition between tropomyosins and a - actinin for actin ﬁlament binding needs to be elucidated . Tropomyosins are well - established regulators of myosin II ac - tivity in muscle sarcomeres . Also , many non - muscle tropomy - osin isoforms can affect the MgATPase activity and motility of myosins along actin ﬁlaments [ 24 – 28 ] . However , the effects of different stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosin isoforms on myosin II have not been systematically compared . To elucidate how the decoration of actin ﬁlaments with different tropomyosin isoforms inﬂuences their interaction with myosin II , we measured the actin - activated ATPase activity of non - muscle myosin IIa heavy meromyosin ( NMIIa - HMM ) during steady state . These ex - periments revealed that whereas Tpm4 . 2 , Tpm3 . 1 , and Tpm3 . 2 efﬁciently increased the actin - activated ATPase activity of NMIIa - HMM , the other tropomyosin isoforms had no detectable effect on myosin IIa activity . Similar results were obtained in assays carried out with either skeletal muscle a - actin or non - muscle b - actin ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . Together , these experiments demonstrate that actin ﬁlaments decorated by different tropomyosin isoforms display distinct functional properties . Filaments decorated with Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 do not activate myosin IIa but efﬁciently protect ﬁla - ments from coﬁlin - induced disassembly . On the other hand , Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 , and Tpm4 . 2 stimulate the actin - induced ATPase activity of myosin IIa but do not efﬁciently protect actin ﬁlaments from coﬁlin . The effects of Tpm 3 . 1 and Tpm4 . 2 on myosin IIa activity are also consistent with cell biological data providing evidence that these tropomyosin isoforms can recruit myosin II to stress ﬁbers [ 6 , 7 ] . Interestingly , the functions of tropomyosins in ﬁlament stabilization versus myosin II activation appear to correlate with the dynamics of their actin interactions . This is because Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 display very stable associ - ation with actin ﬁlaments , whereas Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 , and Tpm4 . 2 exhibit dynamic interactions with actin ( Figure 4E ) . Whereas other stress - ﬁber - associated tropomyosin isoforms eitheractivatemyosinIIorprotectﬁlamentsfromcoﬁlin - mediated disassembly , Tpm2 . 1 does not display strong effects on either of these activities . We propose that this tropomyosin isoform regu - lates some other aspects of stress ﬁber assembly , dynamics , or contractility by controlling the activity or localization of another protein ( s ) within the stress ﬁber network . Moreover , it is possible that Tpm2 . 1 works only in concert with some other stress ﬁber proteins , such as caldesmonandcalponins , incells . Interestingly , Tpm2 . 1 accumulates at focal adhesions at the distal ends of dor - sal stress ﬁbers , and recent studies demonstrated that it controls mechanosensitive sarcomere - like contractile units at these sites [ 7 , 29 ] . In the future , it will be interesting to examine the interplay of different mammalian tropomyosin isoforms with a wider range of actin - binding proteins , including different ﬁlament cross - linkers , other myosins , the Arp2 / 3 complex , and proﬁlin , which in other organisms were shown to exhibit interplay with tropomy - osins on actin ﬁlaments [ 30 – 33 ] . Please note that , although different tropomyosin isoforms display distinct localization pat - terns along non - contractile dorsal stress ﬁbers , they all localize to myosin II - containing foci in contractile ventral stress ﬁbers . Thus , in addition to other actin - binding proteins , tropomyosins mayalsoworkinconcertwitheachothertogenerateandmaintain complex actin ﬁlament arrays in cells . In the context of the stress ﬁber network , it is possible that the non - contractile dorsal stress ﬁbers need protection from ADF / coﬁlin - induced ﬁlament disas - sembly and are thus composed of Tpm1 . 6 - decorated actin ﬁla - ments [ 7 ] . Ontheotherhand , actinﬁlamentsthatareundermyosin II - generated tension are protected from ADF / coﬁlins [ 14 , 34 ] . These ‘‘myosin II - associating’’ actin ﬁlaments may not , therefore , requireTpm1 . 6orTpm1 . 7toinhibittheirseveringby ADF / coﬁlins . Itisalso importanttonotethatﬁlamentseveringbyADF / coﬁlinsis greatly enhanced by their co - factors , including coronin , and Aip1 in cells [ 35 ] , adding more complexity to the system . Our in vitro TIRF microscopy experiments also provide the ﬁrst evidence that most tropomyosins cannot co - polymerize with each other on actin ﬁlaments but instead segregate into different ﬁlaments or ﬁlament segments . Thus , tropomyosins have the intrinsic ability to generate distinct actin ﬁlament populations that are decorated by a speciﬁc tropomyosin isoform ( s ) , which subsequently can modulate the interactions of other proteins with these ﬁlaments . These biochemical data also provide an explanation for distinct subcellular localizations of different tropomyosin isoforms within cellular actin ﬁlament networks of motile cells [ 7 , 36 ] . The molecular mechanism underlying tropo - myosin isoform segregation along actin ﬁlaments remains to be elucidated . This can arise from the chemical differences of tropo - myosin N and C termini that either allow or prevent end - to - end association of different tropomyosin molecules . Alternatively ( or in addition ) , this may involve different positioning of distinct tropomyosin isoforms on actin ﬁlaments or their effects on Figure 3 .

The method for calculating the relative actin ﬁlament disassembly rates is described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures . 710 Current Biology 27 , 705 – 713 , March 6 , 2017 the conformation of actin ﬁlaments . The latter alternative is sup - ported by the fact that tropomyosins decorate the two structur - ally identical grooves along an actin ﬁlament , and thus their segregation cannot be solely determined by head - to - tail associ - ations ( i . e . , some coordination must exist between the two tropo - myosin - binding grooves when ﬁlament segments decorated by only one tropomyosin isoform exist ) . This may reciprocally also explain why Tpm2 . 1 and Tpm3 . 1 / 2 , which exhibit major differ - ences in their N - terminal sequences , do not segregate to different actin ﬁlaments in our TIRF assay . Furthermore , the mechanisms by which different tropomyosin isoforms are targeted to their speciﬁc cellular destinations Figure 4 .

Current Biology 27 , 705 – 713 , March 6 , 2017 711 remain to be elucidated . Good candidates for this task are for - mins , which at least in ﬁssion yeast can induce assembly of actin ﬁlament structures that are decorated by speciﬁc tropomyosin isoforms [ 37 ] . Intriguingly , at least four different formins are linked to the assembly of the stress ﬁber network in motile cells [ 7 , 10 , 11 , 13 ] , and thus these formins may provide the link between actin ﬁlament nucleation and incorporation of speciﬁc tropomyosin isoforms into the different regions of the stress ﬁber network .

The actin and Tpm4 . 2 concentrations were 8 m M and 1 m M , and the concentration of a - actinin - 1 was varied from 0 to 4 m M . S = supernatant and P = pellet . SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES DNA constructs The open reading frames of the human stress fiber associated tropomyosins [ S1 ] were amplified with appropriate primers and cloned into pBAT4 vector , appropriate for expression of non - tagged proteins in bacterial cells . A region encoding an Ala - Ser extension , mimicking the N - terminal acetylation modification of native tropomyosins [ S2 ] was also introduced to all constructs . To generate constructs expressing N - terminally sfGFP - and mCherry - tagged tropomyosins , sfGFP - and mCherry - sequences with an N - terminal 6xHis tag were introduced to the 5’ - prime ends of the constructs described above . Special attention was paid to creating the same linker sequence in all constructs , which is identical to the one used in GFP - Tpm 4 . 2 rescue construct applied in the previous work [ S1 ] . Protein purification Non - tagged tropomyosins were expressed in E . coli BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) cells , grown at 37 o C in 800 ml LB broth , containing carbenicillin ( 100 μ g / ml ) and chloramphenicol ( 50 μ g / ml ) until OD 0 . 6 . Expression was induced by the addition of isopropylthio - b - D galactosidase ( IPTG , Sigma ) to final concentration of 2 mM and the cells were grown for 3h at 37 o C . Tagged tropomyosins were also expressed in E . coli BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) cells , grown at 37 o C in 800 ml LB broth , containing carbenicillin ( 100 μ g / ml ) and chloramphenicol ( 50 μ g / ml ) until OD 0 . 5 . Cultures were then cooled and expression was induced by the addition of isopropylthio - b - D galactosidase ( IPTG , Sigma ) to final concentration of 2 mM , and the cells were incubated with shaking overnight at 16 o C . The cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets were frozen at - 80 o C until purification . The non - tagged tropomyosin pellets were re - suspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Hepes pH 8 , 25 % Sucrose , 5 mM EGTA , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM DTT , 500 mM NaCl , 1 mM PMSF , 10 % Glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton , complete protease inhibitor tablet ( Roche ) ) and the sample was homogenized at EmulsiFlex according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . The cell suspension was incubated for 15 minutes with 27 m M MnCl 2 , 1 mg DNaseI ( 100 m l of 10 mg / ml to 15 ml of cell lysate ) , followed by 20 minutes incubation with 1 : 1 volume of lysis buffer containing 2 M NaCl . The cell suspension was subsequently incubated at + 85 o C for 7 minutes , cooled on ice for 15 minutes , and centrifuged at 30 . 000 g , at 4 o C for 1 hour . To precipitate the tropomyosins , NaAc pH 4 . 8 was added to final concentration of 80 mM in the supernant , and the solution was incubated for 30 - 60 minutes at 4 o C on a shaker . The precipitated tropomyosins were collected by centrifugation at 30 . 000 g , at 4 o C for 1 hour . The pellet was re - suspended and dialysed against buffer A ( 50 mM Hepes pH 8 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM β - mercaptoEtOH , 1 mM DTT , 100 mM NaCl , 10 % Glycerol , 0 . 1 % Triton ) overnight , with two buffer changes . The dialysed protein was centrifuged at 26 . 700 g , for 20 minutes , at 4 o C to remove aggregates , and the supernatant was loaded on equilibrated 10 ml HiTrap Q HP anion exchange column . After extensive washing , the tropomyosins were eluted via linear gradient from 0 – 1000 mM NaCl over 10 column volumes , peak fractions were combined , concentrated and loaded on Superdex - 75 gel filtration column , equilibrated with 50 mM Hepes pH 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 10 mM DTT and 1 mM β - mercaptoEtOH . The protein - containing fractions were pooled , concentrated , frozen , and stored at - 80 o C or - 20 o C . The his - tagged sfGFP / mCherry fusions of tropomyosins were purified with Ni - NTA agarose beads ( Qiagen ) according to manifacturer’s instructions . Briefly , pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer , containing 50 mM Hepes , pH 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM Imidazol , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 15 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 1 % Triton - X , 2 % glycerol , 0 . 1mM PMSF , complete protease inhibitor tablet ( Roche ) , homogenized at EmulsiFlex , the cell debris were separated from the cell lysate via centrifugation and the supernatant was incubated with Ni - NTA beads , equilibrated with lysis buffer . The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer , containing 20 mM Imidazol , and the bound protein was eluted with lysis buffer , containing 500 mM Imidazol . The eluates were concentrated when needed , aggregates were removed by quick centrifugation , and the samples were loaded on Superdex - 200 gel filtration column , equilibrated with gel filtration buffer ( 50 mM Hepes , pH 8 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM DTT , 20 % glycerol ) . The peak fractions were collected , concentrated , and stored at - 80 o C or - 20 o C . Non - muscle actin ( β / γ - actin ) and profilin were prepared from bovine spleen as described in [ S3 ] with minor changes . In brief , fresh bovine spleen was homogenized and profilin : actin complex was extracted by using poly - L - proline column . Actin was separated from profilin by polymerization - depolymerization cycles and both proteins were stored at - 80 o C until further use . Human a - actinin - 1 construct in pET8C vector was a kind gift from Kristina Djinovic - Carugo lab . Protein was expressed in auto - induction media ZYP5052 and purified according to the previously described protocol [ S4 ] . Mouse cofilin - 1 and mCherry - cofilin - 1 were expressed and purified as described in [ S5 ] . Co - sedimentation assays Actin co - sedimentation assay was carried out essentially as described earlier [ S5 ] . Briefly , different amounts of β / γ - actin were polymerized together with 1 µM of each tropomyosin isoform for 30 minutes at RT in the presence of G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 with 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) by addition of 5 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 1x Imidazole buffer ( 10x Imidazole buffer : 100 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM DTT , 100 mM β - mercaptoEtOH and 2 mM PMSF ) . To sediment the polymerized actin filaments and bound proteins , the samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation ( 30 minutes , 20 o C , 156425 g ) . For competition assays with tropomyosin isoforms and α - actinin - 1 , β / γ - actin ( 8 µM ) was pre - polymerized in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 with 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 ) for 30 minutes at room temperature by addition of MgCl 2 to the final concentration of 5 mM , in the presence of 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 1x Imidazole buffer . One µM of various tropomyosin isoforms and 1 . 6 µM of α - actinin - 1 were sequentially added to the pre - polymerized actin with 30 minutes incubation at room temperature in between . Final samples were further incubated for 30 minutes . Actin filaments were sedimented by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 20 o C in a Beckman Optima MAX Ultracentrifuge at 100000 rpm for Tpm2 . 1 , Tpm4 . 2 , Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 and at 60000 rpm for Tpm1 . 6 and Tpm1 . 7 in a TLA100 rotor . Equal proportions of supernatants and pellets were run on 4 - 20 % gradient SDS - polyacrylamide gels ( Mini - PROTEAN TGX Precast Gels , Bio - Rad Laboratories Inc . ) , which were stained with Coomassie Blue . The intensities of tropomyosin bands were quantified with QuantityOne program ( Bio - Rad Laboratories Inc . ) , analyzed and plotted as tropomyosin bound to actin ( μ M , tropomyosin in pellet ) in the absence and presence of α - actinin - 1 . Please note that a - actinin - 1 addition did not significantly increase the amount of actin in the pellet fraction . FRAP experiments The experiments on individual filaments were performed on a confocal spinning disk from Roper Scientific , based on an inversed Nikon Eclipse TI and equipped with a Photometrics EMCCD Evolve camera . For sfGFP imaging , a 491 - nm laser line ( 100mW ) and a Plan APO ON 100x / 1 , 4 objective was used . Images are recorded through Metamorph with binning 1 . Briefly , non - labeled actin ( 0 . 6 m M ) was polymerized for 20 minutes and 0 . 8 µM sfGFP - labeled tropomyosins were added to the pre - polymerized filaments , and the samples were injected into TIRF chamber . Few pre - bleaching frames were imaged before the filament was bleached for 15 seconds and then followed for 10 minutes with images recorded at every 15 seconds . Protein recovery was analyzed with ImageJ software for 5 - 6 filaments / sample . Actin filament bundles were induced with increasing the percentage of methylcellulose in TIRF fluorescence buffer as previously described [ S6 ] . Briefly , 3 . 3 µM sfGFP - fusions of tropomyosin isoforms were mixed with 0 . 9 µM b / g - actin ( containing 5 % of rhodamine lysine - labelled human platelet actin , Cytoskeleton Inc . ) in the presence of 5 % methylcellulose to induce bundles and incubated for 30 minutes prior to imaging in a TIRF chamber . Imaging was performed on Leica TCS SP5II HCS A confocal microscope , equipped with PMT and LasAF software . For sfGFP visualization a 488 nm ( 35mW ) laser line and HCX PL APO 63x / 1 , 2 W Corr / 0 , 17 CS ( water ) Lbd . bl objective were used . Prior to bleaching with full laser power for 3 frames , 3 frames were recorded , and then the fluorescence recovery was followed for 12 minutes after bleaching by obtaining images every 5 seconds for the first 24 frames , and every 15 seconds for 40 frames . Protein recovery was analyzed with ImageJ software for 5 - 6 filaments / sample . In vitro TIRF microscopy In vitro TIRF experiments were performed essentially as previously described [ S7 ] . Briefly , 0 . 8 m M of β / γ - actin , sfGFP - Tpms and mCherry - Tpms were diluted in fluorescence buffer containing 10 mM imidazole - HCl pH 7 . 8 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 3 mg / ml glucose , 20 μ g / ml catalase , 100 μ g / ml glucose oxidase , and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose . The concentrations of each sfGFP and mCherry isoform was titrated to obtain maximum filament labelling without intense background staining . This resulted in final concentrations between 150 and 360 nM of sfGFP and 300 nM to 1 . 4 m M of mCherry fusion proteins . After addition of the proteins to G - actin and fluorescent buffer , the solution was injected into TIRF chambers and imaged after 5 minutes incubation . Each video was recorded for 20 - 30 minutes , and images were acquired with a minimal delay ( 0 . 2 m seconds ) or every 5 - 10 seconds . For in vitro TIRF experiments with cofilin - 1 , 150 nM of sfGFP - HMW - Tm isoforms ( Tpm2 . 1 , Tpm1 . 6 , Tpm1 . 7 ) and 300 nM of sfGFP - LMW - Tm isoforms ( Tpm3 . 1 , Tpm3 . 2 ) were added to G - actin and polymerization mix , and incubated for 5 minutes at RT , then 150 nM of cherry - cofilin 1 was added to the reaction and imaged immediately . All experiments were imaged at Nikon Eclipse Ti - E TIRF microscope , equipped with 100x Apo TIRF 1 . 49 Oil Objective , 65mW Argon laser , 150mW 561nm laser , Andor iXon + 885 EMCCD camera and NIS elements software . Huygens software was used for very light deconvolution ( 2 cycles ) to remove noise from the TIRF data and calculate the percentage of red pixels co - localizing with green pixels . β / γ - actin disassembly assay The steady - state rate of β / γ - actin filament disassembly was measured using a modified protocol described for muscle actin in [ S5 ] . Samples of polymerized pyrene actin ( 4 μ M ) were mixed and incubated for 5 minutes with 1 . 25 µM of various tropomyosins before the addition of 1 μ M cofilin - 1 followed by further 5 minutes incubation . All protein mixtures were assembled in 1 . 5 ml Eppendorf tubes and after initialization of the reaction by the addition of 6 µM DBP were moved to the fluorometric cuvettes . During the experiments , buffer conditions were constant : 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 1x Imidazole buffer ( 10x Imidazole buffer : 100 mM Imidazole pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM DTT , 100 mM β - mercaptoEtOH and 2 mM PMSF ) . All measurements were carried out using Perkin Elmer fluorometer or Agilent Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer with BioMelt Bundle System ( Agilent Technologies ) with excitation at 365 nm ( Ex . Slit = 10 nm ) and emission at 407 nm ( Em . Slit = 20 nm ) . Origin 7 . 5 software ( OriginLab Corp . ) was used to analyze the data . To calculate the relative actin filament disassembly rates in the presence of different tropomyosins , linear region of each curve during 170 – 400 seconds time interval was fitted with equation y = a·x + b , where coefficient “a” represents speed of the process . Please note that the first 170 seconds of the data were excluded from the analysis due to the possible effect of the short mechanically broken actin filaments . Steady - state ATPase measurements The regulatory light chain of NM - 2A - HMM was phosphorylated for 30 minutes at 30 °C in ATPase Buffer ( 20 mM MOPS pH 7 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 15 mM EGTA , 2 mM DTT ) containing 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 μ M calmodulin ( CaM ) , 2 μ M essential light chain ( MYL6 ) , 2 μ M regulatory light chain ( MYL12b ) , 1mM ATP and 50 nM myosin light chain kinase ( MLCK ) . The steady - state ATPase rates were measured in an NADH - coupled assay using 0 . 3 μ M NM - 2a - HMM in ATPase buffer containing 1 mM ATP , 0 . 8 mM NADH , 0 . 5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate , 20 μ g / ml lactate dehydrogenase and 50 μ g / ml pyruvate kinase . All combinations were tested with and without the addition of NM - 2A - HMM , and the actin ATPase rate was then subtracted from the NM - 2A - HMM ATPase rates . Muscle actin or b - actin was pre - incubated with the different tropomyosins for 30 minutes at RT , before addition to the assay mix . The assays were performed with final concentrations of 20 μ M actin and 20 μ M tropomyosin . The change in absorption at 340 nm was recorded in a 96 - well plate on a microplate reader at 25 °C . Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 7 software . The Gaussian distribution of ATPase assay data was confirmed and a one - way ANOVA was performed comparing all conditions to the bare - actin control ( * p < 0 . 05 , * * * p < 0 . 001 ) . RNAi – rescue experiments Tpm1 . 6 / 1 . 7 , Tpm 2 . 1 and Tpm3 . 1 / 3 . 2 knockdown U2OS cells were generated with specific Alexa Fluor - 488 labelled siRNA oligonucleotides and the cells were transfected with sfGFP - Tpm constructs essentially as previously described [ S1 ] . Tropomyosins were detected with the following antibodies : TM311 monoclonal antibody ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for Tpm 1 . 6 / 1 . 7 , CG β 6 for Tpm 2 . 1 and sheep polyclonal γ / 9D for Tpm 3 . 1 / 3 . 2 , and actin filaments were visualized with Alexa Fluor 647 – phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) . The samples were imaged at Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 upright epifluorescence microscope equipped with 100x / 1 . 3 oil EC Plan Neofluar objective , Hamamatsu Orca Flash 4 . 0 LT camera and Zen software or Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope equipped with LCI Plan - Neofluar 63x / 1 . 30 glycerol objective , 639 nm / 5mW , 555 nm / 10mW , 488 nm / 10mW laser lines and Zen software . To quantify the number of stress fiber per cell , the line profile tool of ImagePro Plus 5 . 1 was applied to draw lines perpendicular to the dorsal stress fibers , lamella or ventral stress fibers , and the intensity peaks along the lines in the phalloidin channel were counted as previously described [ S1 ] .
