Their universality and concurrency suggest a unifying 4 mechanism to exist causing all of them . We search for that mechanism by investigating trajectories of MDA - MB - 5 231 cells on Fibronectin lanes . We also find multistability caused by the clutch mechanism of retrograde flow . 6 Control of the clutch parameters by integrin signalling causes the biphasic adhesion - velocity relation . Protrusion 7 competition based on the clutch causes direction reversal events , the statistics of which explains the UCSP . We 8 suggest that F - actin polymerisation , clutch mechanism of retrograde flow , protrusion competition via membrane 9 tension and drag forces cause the multistability and dynamic cell states , state transition statistics causes the 10 UCSP and the control of this dynamic system by integrin signalling entails the adhesion - velocity relation . 11 The motion of eukaryotic cells is essential for embryonic development , wound healing , immune responses , and 12 tumour metastasis [ 1 ] . Much effort has been devoted to the study of mesenchymal migration with prototypical in 13 vitro motion of cells on 2 - dimensional adhesive substrates . Cell migration starts with polarisation breaking the spatial 14 symmetry and the formation of a lamellipodium , which is a protrusion of a thin sheet of cytoplasm ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 3 µ m thick ) 15 covering tens to hundreds of square micrometres [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . The lamellipodium is mechanically stabilised by 16 adhesion with the substrate [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ] and is constructed from a network of actin filaments [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 17 , 18 ] . Polymerisation of filament barbed ends at the leading edge of the lamellipodium generates motion and 18 pushes the edge forward [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 ] . Further back , the pointed ends depolymerise and replenish the pool of 19 actin monomers [ 17 , 18 ] . Once cells are moving , their shape is determined by internal force generation patterns and 20 adhesion [ 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] . 21 Many cell types obey both the adhesion - velocity relation and the universal correlation between speed and persis - 22 tence ( UCSP ) . The dependency of the cell velocity on adhesion exhibits a velocity maximum at intermediate strength , 23 1 and slower velocities both at weak and strong adhesion [ 29 , 31 , 32 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 33 , 25 , 30 ] . Results on the 24 UCSP , describing the relation between cell velocity and persistence time , suggest it to be of similar universality [ 34 ] . 25 The faster cells move the more persistent they move . Maiuri et al . report this observation for many different cell 26 types and suggest persistence time to depend exponentially on cell velocity [ 34 ] . These types of relations describing 27 the response of a system to external parameters are called constitutive relations in Physics and Engineering . The 28 stationary force - velocity relation is another constitutive relation we will discuss . 29 Another general observation is that both the shape and the motile state of cells is highly dynamic . Cells stop 30 and start to move again , develop new protrusions , and change direction [ 35 , 44 , 24 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 36 , 28 , 37 , 31 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 ] . In addition to these states of motion , there exist states distinguished by the dynamic regime 32 of front protrusion and cell back and / or back protrusion . Stationary and oscillatory dynamic regimes with one or 33 several protrusions have been observed , and caused a surge of interest in multistability in cell motility [ 42 , 53 , 54 , 34 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 5 , 59 , 43 , 38 , 51 , 52 ] . 35 Multistability with its state dynamics , biphasic adhesion - velocity relation and the UCSP appear to describe the 36 motile behaviour of many different cell types . Mechanisms have been suggested for multistability [ 52 , 51 , 55 , 56 , 37 58 , 59 , 38 ] , the biphasic adhesion - velocity relation [ 29 , 10 , 33 , 30 ] , the UCSP [ 34 ] and the stationary force - velocity 38 relation [ 60 ] each separately . However , the generality and concurrency of multistability and the constitutive relations 39 strongly suggest that a single mechanism should explain all three of them . 40 In search for such a mechanism , we carry out a series of experiments with MDA - MB - 231 cells on 1d lanes in a 41 range of Fibronectin concentrations and formulate our suggestion for a mechanism as a biophysical model based on 42 the studies [ 30 , 61 ] . The mechanism involves the force balance at the protrusion edges , the clutch mechanism of 43 retrograde flow , competing protrusions and integrin signalling . Our key finding is that the intracellular dynamics 44 generating multistability also determine the constitutive relations . We will introduce basic experimental observations 45 in section 1 . 1 , characterise cell states and compare experimental and simulated data in section 1 . 2 and explain state 46 transitions and their relation to the UCSP in section 1 . 3 . We will explain the ideas defining the theory and compute 47 the force - velocity relation and adhesion - velocity relation in section 3 . 6 . 48 1 Results 49 1 . 1 Dynamic cell states 50 We monitored MDA - MB - 231 cells migrating in Fibronectin coated lanes using scanning time - lapse microscopy . 51 Movies from several fields of view were recorded with typically 10 min intervals over 48 h collecting in total more 52 than 20 . 000 cell trajectories as described in the methods section . A representative kymograph of the 1 - dimensional 53 cell motion is depicted in Fig . 1A . We find 4 different dynamic states ( Fig . 1B - E ) : a spread state with steady length 54 ( SS ) , a spread state with oscillatory protrusions at both ends ( SO ) , a moving state with steady length ( MS ) , and 55 2 Figure 1 : Four dynamic states and two motion directions form the multistability of MDA - MB - 231 cells on homogeneous Fibronectin lanes . ( A ) Kymograph from a typical 48h - trajectory . ( B ) A spread ( S ) cell with steady length ( S ) . We call this state SS . ( C ) A spread cell with oscillatory length ( O ) . We call this state SO . ( D ) A moving cell ( M ) with steady length - state MS . ( E ) A moving cell with oscillating length - state MO . ( F ) Transition from a downward moving MS state to an upward moving MS state . ( G ) - ( K ) The cells undergo a MS → SS , MS → MO , SO → MS , MO → SS and SO → SS transition , resp . All kymographs are shown with a time resolution of 30 s . Time goes from left to right . The vertical scale bars represent 100 µ m , the horizontal scale bars 60 min . 3 a moving state with an oscillating back protrusion ( MO ) . The two moving states exist as up and down going , so 56 that we observe 6 states in total . We also exemplify 6 different state transitions . All of them occur on homogeneous 57 Fibronectin lanes and without any stimulation . Therefore , we call them spontaneous transitions . The states SS and 58 MO have also been found with RPE1 cells and NIH - 3T3 fibroblasts [ 42 ] , and all four dynamic states with C6 glioma 59 cells . 60 The oscillatory dynamics in SO and MO does not exhibit a regular period in many cases . This irregularity of 61 repetitive protrusion events indicates rather a noisy excitable regime than regular oscillations in the strict sense of 62 dynamical systems theory . We will see in section 1 . 2 that we find regular oscillations , noisy oscillations and a noisy 63 excitable regime in our biophysical model . 64 Spread cells are symmetric and exhibit protrusions at both ends . Moving cells of course display protrusions at the 65 front . However , we can identify additional back protrusions easily by the occurrence of negative back edge velocities 66 in the oscillatory states as the cells in panels E and J of Fig . 1 exhibit . Hence , also moving oscillatory cells exhibit 67 protrusions at the front and back . We cannot tell from panel F , whether a protrusion exists at the back of a cell 68 in state MS while it moves steadily . If steady protrusions at the back exist , they are most likely shorter than front 69 protrusions ( see below ) . However , the emergence or extension of a back protrusion precedes the direction reversal 70 in panel F by about 30 min . Hence , protrusions at front and back exist at the time of the transition which supports 71 the idea of direction reversals being the result of the competition of front and back protrusions as we will see below . 72 1 . 2 Analysis of dynamic cell states 73 We analyse cell states on the basis of our biophysical model . Its components are explained in Fig . 2 and the equations 74 are introduced in section 3 . 6 and the supplemental material . Eqs . 1 - 3 together describe the cell dynamics in terms 75 of cell length and the retrograde flow friction coefficient κ determined by the number of bonds between the F - actin 76 network and structures stationary in the lab frame of reference , i . e . the clutch state . 77 Our model reproduces the adhesion velocity relation in agreement with experiments ( Fig . 2B , section S5 ) . This 78 relation has been discussed in detail in Schreiber et al . [ 30 ] for cells with one protrusion in the direction of motion . 79 The reproduction of this fundamental relation by the two - protrusion model supports our choice of modelling of the 80 effect of Fibronectin signalling on friction and drag forces . The model predicts a stationary force - velocity relation of 81 cell motion as shown in Fig . 2C . Our results are very similar to relations predicted earlier [ 60 , 30 ] . All predictions 82 agree in the point that this relation reflects the retrograde flow friction law [ 60 , 30 ] . 83 Analysis of cell states starts with appointing stretches of trajectories to one of the 4 dynamic states . The method 84 of state classification is explained in section S2 . 1 and Fig . S1 in detail . It analyses cell behaviour described by 85 kymographs . Deducing states from behaviour requires to define a minimal time of consistency . If the behaviour 86 qualifies for this time as belonging to a specific state , we appoint this state to the cell . We have chosen 1h as this 87 time ( see section S2 . 1 ) . We do not classify the state of simulated cells on the basis of the known dynamic regime of the 88 4 Figure 2 : Model constituents . ( A ) Cartoon of a cell moving on a 1d Fibronectin lane ( top ) , force balances ( middle ) and the mechanical components of the model ( bottom ) . Front and back protrusion edges move with velocities v f and v b , resp . The F - actin networks flow with the retrograde flow rates v r , f and v r , b , resp . The forces F b = κ b v r , b and F f = κ f v r , f arise from polymerisation of F - actin , act on the protrusion edge membrane and drive retrograde flow against the friction forces . The front and back edge membrane experience drag with the coefficients ζ f and ζ b , resp . Elastic forces E ( L f − L 0 ) and E ( L b − L 0 ) act between the cell body and the edges ( equilibrium length L 0 ) . The balance of the elastic forces determines the motion of the cell body against the drag force ζ c v c . Bottom panels illustrate types of essential relations of the model . The de - attachment force of the back F de is linearly related to velocity . The friction force between F - actin network retrograde flow v r and stationary structures exhibits a maximum in its dependency on retrograde flow ( clutch ) . The polymerisation force F p is logarithmically related to the network extension rate v e due to the force dependency of the polymerisation rate . Two constitutive relations .

( B ) Fraction of cells in the cell states in experiment ( 2878 h of trajectories ) and in simulations sampled from experiments on a range of Fibronectin concentrations ( see section S1 . 2 for details ) . ( C ) , ( D ) Cell states of the noise - free model illustrated by their value of the friction coefficient κ in the stationary state ( C ) and the cell velocity v ( D ) for Fibronectin concentration B . Only the state SS exists at low B . At the concentration denoted as branch point , moving states appear and coexist with the spread state . Oscillations start ( dashed lines ) at the Fibronectin concentrations marked as Hopf bifurcations . All moving states exist as up and down moving ( D ) .

( F ) Measured time course of edge velocity and cell length in state MO ( blue front , orange back ) . ( G ) The steady states MS ( upper panel ) and SS ( lower panel ) are excitable . They behave steadily with noise free dynamics . Noise is switched on at the time marked by the red line . It causes behaviour very similar to noisy oscillations ( Fig . S2 ) . Parameters of all simulations are listed in set 1 in Table S2 . 6 model , but rather apply the same procedure to experimental and simulated data in order to maximise compatibility 89 of outcome . 90 We draw our mechanistic conclusions on the basis of the agreement between model results and experiments . 91 The model reproduces all 4 dynamic states of MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 3A ) . Both quantitative characteristics with 92 regard to fraction of cells in the different states ( Fig . 3B ) , oscillation period , oscillation amplitude and velocity , 93 and qualitative ones like the back edge but not the front oscillating in the moving state are met by the model 94 ( Fig . 3A , E , F ) . 95 The force generation machinery at front and back protrusion work asymmetrically in the motile states MS and 96 MO . This polarisation between protrusions does not require any signalling to be established . It is based completely 97 on the mechanical properties of retrograde flow . Retrograde flow is always faster at the back than at the front , 98 since it needs to keep up with cell motion ( Figs . 2A , S7 ) . Therefore , the biphasic friction force - retrograde flow 99 velocity relation ( Fig . 2 , Eq . S19 ) entails that the strongest coupling between F - actin network and substrate via 100 adhesion structures forms in the front protrusion . The value of κ f is always higher and forces are stronger in the 101 front protrusion than in the back protrusion ( Fig . 3E ) . 102 Driven stick - slip systems robustly generate oscillations [ 62 , 63 ] . A stick - slip transition of the clutch is also here 103 the core of the oscillation mechanism of the protrusions similar to earlier studies [ 42 , 52 , 51 ] . We describe it in detail 104 in section S4 . Whenever the forces driving retrograde flow drive it up to v cr , the flow slips causing the peaks in 105 edge velocity and retrograde flow rate in Fig . 3E , F and a sudden drop of the friction coefficient and all forces . The 106 recovery of κ afterwards is slow and takes the larger part of the period . 107 Retrograde flow velocity v r is equal to the network extension rate in the state SS . It is a tense state with 108 two balanced opposing forces . This tense state is unstable against supercritical fluctuations in κ , which may arise 109 from the concurrent snapping or formation of bonds between the F - actin network and stationary structures , and 110 other perturbations as we will see below . The protrusion goes through one protrusion - retraction cycle upon a 111 sufficiently strong perturbation . If these perturbations occur randomly , they are called noise . Chemical noise from 112 random formation and breakage of bonds is omnipresent and represents relevant perturbations in systems as small 113 as protrusions [ 64 ] . The relevance of noise for adhesion and retrograde flow dynamics has been demonstrated by a 114 variety of studies [ 61 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 ] . 115 States in which small ( but supercritical ) perturbations may cause a large response are called excitable . Both the 116 state SS and MS are excitable ( Fig . 3G ) . The protrusion - retraction cycle after a perturbation in the excitable regime 117 is very similar to the oscillation cycle of noisy oscillations ( Fig . S2 ) . Therefore , the permanent noise in the bonds 118 between the F - actin network and adhesion structures may cause oscillation - like behaviour in the model cells even if 119 they are in states SS and MS ( Fig . 3G ) . Whether the noise is supercritical - causing oscillations - or not depends on 120 the specific parameters of the cell and the noise amplitude . Thus , the states SS and MS with low noise amplitude 121 coexist with oscillation - like states at higher noise amplitude . 122 7 The experimental and simulated oscillations shown in Fig . 3A are both rather smooth with subcritical noise , but 123 noise may have a strong effect on state MO as we show in Fig . S2 . It not only renders the time course irregular , 124 but also substantially shortens the average period . Interestingly , we find examples for both smooth ( Fig . 3A ) and 125 noisy oscillations ( Fig . 1 ) in the experimental data indicating that noise amplitude is a cellular parameter and varies 126 between individual cells . Accordingly , we have put the model noise in the clutch mechanism of retrograde flow , which 127 is an intracellular process . 128 Figure 3C shows the existence of the dynamic states of the noise - free model cell in a systematic way for a range 129 of Fibronectin coating densities . At coating densities below the value of B marked as branch point , only the spread 130 state SS exists . Above it , spread and moving states coexist . Co - existence of several observable states for one set of 131 parameters is multistability . At the Fibronectin density values marked as Hopf bifurcation points , oscillations start 132 and we observe the states SO and MO . Between the branch point and the Hopf bifurcation of the spread branch , the 133 spread state SS and moving state MS coexist . The Hopf bifurcation of the spread state occurs at smaller Fibronectin 134 density ( B ) than the one of the moving state , and thus we find a range of coexistence of SO and MS . This order 135 of bifurcation points is swapped at other parameter values and therefore SS can also coexist with MO ( see Fig . S3 , 136 section S6 ) . SO and MO coexist at large B - values . 137 An individual cell is described in the model by a set of parameter values . The population of cells in a given 138 experiment represents many different parameter value sets due to cell - to - cell variability . Therefore , we may find all 139 possible pairings of coexistence in a single experiment and both moving states can coexist with both spread states 140 ( Figs . 3C , S3 ) . 141 In correspondence to its versatile experimental observation , multistability of the four morphodynamic states 142 appears to be a very robust property of mathematical models of cells on 1d lanes including the clutch . Sens [ 52 ] 143 and Ron et al . [ 51 ] also report very similar steady and oscillatory states ( but not the excitable regime ) and their 144 coexistence in noise - free models . Hennig et al . report the states SS and MO and the irregularity of oscillations in a 145 noisy stick - slip model [ 42 ] . 146 1 . 3 Transitions between cell states 147 All possible transitions are illustrated in Fig . 4A . The fractions of transitions out of a given state are shown in 148 Fig . 4B for the experimental data . The simulations in Fig . 4C show good agreement with the measurements . The 149 same applies to the comparison of theory and experiment with Latrunculin A and Blebbistatin applied shown in 150 Fig . S4 . 151 Transitions between the dynamic states demonstrate that an individual cell can be in different states at given 152 fixed conditions ( or at the same parameter values in modelling terms ) . They are the experimental manifestation 153 of multistability . The multistability in the biophysical model is shown in Figs . 3C , D , S3 . Both spread states SS 154 and SO can coexist with either MS or MO in the biophysical model . The upward - moving states coexist with their 155 8 Figure 4 : The transitions between the cell states . ( A ) The states MS moving steadily , MO moving oscillatory , SS spread steadily , SO spread oscillatory are introduced in Fig . 3 and the text . Arrows distinguish moving up and down . Solid lines mark transitions in the sense of dynamical systems theory of multistability , i . e . , between states coexisting in the noise - free mathematical model . The state changes along dashed lines are explained in the text . ( B ) , ( C ) Statistics of state transitions in experiments ( B ) and simulations ( C ) . The bars belonging to a specific state listed at the bottom of the panel show the fraction of transitions out of this state to one of the other states . Transition types are colour - coded as in panel A . MO ↓ and MS ↓ indicate direction change in the transition . Analogous results with experimental data with Blebbistatin and Latrunculin A applied are provided in Fig . S4 . Sample size is indicated by the numbers inside the chart . Parameters of all simulations are listed in set 1 Table S2 . downward - moving analogues ( Fig . 3C ) . 156 Transitions between these coexisting cell states are caused by noise in the adhesion variable in the biophysical 157 model . For several reasons we assume that noise causes also the transitions in the MDA - MB - 231 cells . Cells with their 158 typical volume in the fl range are microscopic systems subject to thermal noise in many aspects of their behaviour [ 69 , 159 70 , 71 , 72 ] . Since adhesion sites are discrete spots , their length scales are even two orders of magnitude smaller 160 than cell size rendering them even more susceptible to thermal noise . Our model results show that we can reach 161 good agreement between theory and experiment by noise in the clutch mechanism of retrograde flow . In addition , 162 transitions occur apparently spontaneously on homogeneous Fibronectin lanes without any obvious signalling event 163 or stimulation . 164 We showed above that both motile states can coexist with both spread states in the model . However , SS does 165 not coexist with SO , and neither MS coexists with MO in the bifurcation schemes in Figs . 3C , S3 . How come we see 166 transitions within these pairs of states in experimental and simulated data ? 167 Oscillation - like protrusion events in the excitable regime occur randomly . Due to this randomness , cells may 168 exhibit the characteristics of steady behaviour for a time sufficiently long to qualify as a state , and then switch 169 to oscillation - like behaviour or vice versa . Thus , steady ↔ oscillatory - transitions come out of the state analysis of 170 the data . However , they are not state transitions in the sense of dynamical systems theory for multistable systems 171 9 but correspond to the onset or termination of random phases of consistent behaviour . Simulated and measured 172 data behave very similar in regard to state classification and transitions - including steady ↔ oscillatory - transitions . 173 Therefore , the mechanistic ideas formulated in the model reproduce the statistics of state transitions both in the 174 sense of multistability and the statistics of phases of consistent behaviour of MDA - MB - 231 cells . 175 The identification of steady ↔ oscillatory - transitions in simulated data implies that their occurrence in experimen - 176 tal data does not necessarily indicate parameter value changes . Changing parameter values might be an additional 177 reason for these transitions in experiments , since cells constantly develop , and their cellular parameter values might 178 change within the duration of an experiment of up to 48 h . 179 This section dealt with spontaneous state transitions . We present state transitions caused by Fibronectin steps 180 in the supplementary material section S11 . The biophysical model offers an explanation also for their characteristics . 181 1 . 4 Reversal of direction and the UCSP 182 Fig . 5A shows front and back edge velocity during a direction reversal averaged over many such events including both 183 MS and MO reversals ( see Fig . S7 for the retrograde flow , Fig . S2E for the network extension rate ) . The moment 184 of reversal t rev is the time when the cell nucleus changes direction of motion . The back edge starts to slow down 185 about 10 min prior to t rev and is already moving in the new direction ( negative velocity ) at the time of reversal . 186 The front slows down after the back edge . It still moves in the old direction at t rev and reverses direction only 187 a few minutes later . Finally , it collapses in an event appearing as a negative velocity peak in Fig . 5A . After the 188 recovery of the protrusion , both edges move in the new direction with the same velocity . In agreement with this 189 scenario , the likelihood of back protrusions increases before t rev and the frequency of occurrence of front collapses 190 after t rev . Both experiments and simulations show the same scenario . A supercritical protrusion event at the back 191 pulls sufficiently strong to collapse the front protrusion . The back protrusion event is caused by noise in the state 192 MS . In the MO state , protrusions occur periodically but noise generates supercritical protrusion events . We discuss 193 forces and retrograde flow during reversal events additionally in section S9 and Figs . S2 , S7 , S8 . 194 Random direction reversal events are the reason why cells do not move permanently in their initial direction . 195 Hence , the statistics of direction reversal events shapes the universal correlation between speed and persistence 196 time ( UCSP ) which we show in Fig . 5B . We find an increase of persistence time with cell velocity ( in agreement 197 with earlier results [ 34 ] ) . Application of Latrunculin A increases persistence time . Latrunculin reduces the F - actin 198 polymerisation rate and its application has been modelled accordingly by decreasing the force free polymerisation 199 rate V 0 e ( set 2 in Table S2 ) . We find good agreement between experiment and simulations both for control and 200 Latrunculin A conditions , and also with Blebbistatin applied ( see Fig . S5 ) . 201 The velocity scenario in Fig . 5A , the observation that direction reversals happen only when protrusions at the 202 front and back exist , and a strong robustness of the front protrusion against noise at the front all suggest direction 203 reversal events to arise from competition between the front and back protrusion . As a first step in disentangling the 204 10 Figure 5 : Direction reversal mechanism . ( A ) Front ( v f ) and back ( v b ) velocities during reversal transitions averaged over many tracks ( thin lines , 2878 h experimental trajectories ) , including both MS and MO states . The cell nucleus changes direction at t rev . ( B ) The relation between cell velocity and persistence time in control cells ( 96577 h experimental trajectories ) and with Latrunculin A applied ( 54809 h experimental trajectories ) . Latrunculin A application was modelled by decreasing the network extension rate V 0 e from 3 . 0 to 2 . 2 µ ms − 1 . ( C ) Basin of attraction of the steady protrusion state ( grey area ) and state trajectories ( black lines ) in κ - L plots . Trajectories outside the basin of attraction ( brown ) go to small values of the friction coefficient κ and then to small protrusion length L with fast retrograde flow , which is the collapse . Trajectories starting within the basin of attraction ( purple ) lead to the steady state ( yellow dot ) without collapse . B is 20 ng cm − 2 , velocities of fast and slow cells are 0 . 015 and 0 . 005 µ ms − 1 , respectively . ( D ) Cartoons illustrating definitions of duration of back excitation and front resistance length . Lower panels show simulations of these characteristics . Each dot marks the result of a simulation with parameter values randomly drawn from large parameter ranges ( see section S1 . 2 ) . ( E ) The relation between duration of back excitation and cell velocity , and front resistance length and cell velocity in experiments and simulations ( 2878 h control experimental trajectories , 2343 h Latrunculin A experiments ) . ( F ) Cartoon relations between velocities . Network extension rate ( green ) is the sum of cell velocity ( blue ) and retrograde flow velocity ( red ) in the front protrusion . Retrograde flow velocity is the sum of extension rate and cell velocity in the back protrusion , and therefore always faster than retrograde flow in the front protrusion . ( G ) Cartoon illustrating the effect of Latrunculin A . It reduces the network extension rate . Therefore , Latrunculin A treated cells have slower retrograde flow than control cells with the same cell velocity ( colours as in F ) . This increases back pulling slightly and front resistance substantially ( compare panel D ) and thus renders the cells more persistent than control cells . Parameters of simulations in Table S2 ( set 1 and 2 for control and Latrunculin conditions ) . Error bars represent the standard error of the mean . 11 competition mechanism we provide a picture of protrusion stability exemplified with the state MS . The values of 205 the two dynamic variables friction coefficient κ and protrusion length L describe the state of the model protrusions . 206 Upon a perturbation away from its steady state , a protrusion might just go back to the steady state or collapse 207 ( Figs . 5C , S6 ) . The basin of attraction in a κ - L plot quantifies these two possibilities . If the protrusion is perturbed 208 to a state within the basin of attraction , it relaxes back to the steady protrusion state . It collapses upon larger 209 perturbations . Fig . 5C shows that the basin of attraction of the front protrusion of fast cells is larger than the one 210 of slow cells and vice versa for the back protrusion . Hence , the front protrusion is more stable in fast cells than in 211 slow ones , and the back protrusion is less stable in fast cells than in slow ones . 212 The pulling of the back protrusion on the nucleus and the front during the direction reversal scenario described 213 above increases the front protrusion length L f . If the back pulls strong enough , it shifts the state of the front 214 protrusion from the stationary state to a trajectory outside the basin of attraction , which entails the collapse . The 215 collapse is a rapid decrease of κ due to breaking of bonds between the F - actin network and stationary structures 216 followed by rapid shrinkage of protrusion length due to the elastic force as shown in Fig . 5C ( see also description in 217 section S8 ) . Remarkably , the stochastic event inside the back protrusion , which in the end causes the front protrusion 218 collapse and direction reversal , typically happens minutes before the moment of direction reversal . 219 The back pulls on the front by protruding ( Fig . 5A ) , i . e . , by going through an excitation in the state MS . The 220 slower the retrograde flow in a back protrusion , the longer the excitation lasts ( Fig . 5D ) . Whether it can collapse 221 the front is determined by how long the front can resist the pulling . The slower the retrograde flow in the front 222 protrusion , the longer it can resist . Symbols mark the retrograde flow values of typical fast and slow cells . Back 223 excitations of fast cells are shorter and their fronts can resist longer than slow cells . These properties of front and 224 back protrusion hold for a large parameter range , i . e . these relations between stability characteristics and retrograde 225 flow are fundamental and robust features . 226 The front resistance length is the length the front edge moves after motion arrest of the cell body . Fig . 5E 227 compares values for the duration of back excitation and front resistance length between our experimental data and 228 simulations , and shows the qualitative agreement . Panel F summarizes our insights from the individual investigations . 229 Fast cells have slow retrograde flow in the front protrusion and very fast retrograde flow in the back . This entails 230 strong front protrusions and short excitations at the back and hence long persistence times . Slow cells have slower 231 retrograde flow at the back and faster retrograde flow at the front , causing long back excitations and short front 232 resistance length . They are therefore less persistent . 233 At a given velocity , Latrunculin A increases persistence ( Fig . 5B ) . Application of Latrunculin reduces the network 234 extension rate , and therefore reduces retrograde flow both at front and back compared to control . This increases the 235 duration of back excitations but even more the resistance time and resistance length of the front and thus renders 236 the cell more persistent ( see Fig . 5B , E for experimental data and simulations ) . Fig . 5G summarises the Latrunculin 237 action graphically . We conclude that reducing network extension rate increases persistence in agreement with our 238 12 mechanistic ideas . 239 In summary , the protrusion competition mechanism based on elastic mechanical interaction between protrusions 240 and cell body , non - linear friction of retrograde flow ( clutch ) and noise in the clutch mechanism offers an explanation 241 for the UCSP . The faster cells move , the slower is retrograde flow in the front protrusion , the faster is it in the back 242 protrusion and the more persistent the cell migrates . 243 2 Discussion 244 We analysed multistability of MDA - MB - 231 cells on Fibronectin lanes , and found in our experiments coexistence of 245 states with oscillatory or steady cell shape , spread or moving , moving up or down . We combined the experiments 246 with quantitative theory , which suggests mechanistic ideas for several basic and general observations of mesenchymal 247 motility comprising the biphasic adhesion - velocity relation , stationary force - velocity relation , UCSP , random migra - 248 tion and steady , oscillatory or excitable morphodynamics . Restricting cell motion to 1d made the relation between 249 basic phenomena of cell motility very obvious . Random migration and the UCSP arise from random state transitions 250 between the states ‘moving up’ and ‘moving down’ , and the control of the parameters of the noisy clutch by integrin 251 signalling generates the biphasic adhesion - velocity relation . 252 Our theory comprises three constituents , all of which are well established experimental observations . The first 253 one is the force balance at the protrusion edge ( Eqs . S2 - S4 ) . It establishes the link between polymerisation rate , 254 cell velocity and retrograde flow velocity [ 73 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 74 , 75 ] . The second constituent is the noisy non - linear 255 friction between retrograde flow of the F - actin network and stationary structures ( Eqs . S13 , S14 ) known as clutch 256 mechanism [ 76 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 61 ] . It is crucial for oscillatory dynamics and multistability . Given a cell with protrusions 257 at front and back and symmetry with regard to parameters of the protrusions , the clutch mechanism introduces the 258 mechanical polarisation into a front protrusion with slow retrograde flow and a back protrusion with fast retrograde 259 flow [ 65 , 52 ] . We find that noise in the clutch mechanism due to random bonds between the F - actin network and 260 stationary structures suffices to offer an explanation for state transitions and thus for the UCSP . 261 Multistability , oscillations and mechanical polarisation are all generated by the interaction of non - linear F - actin 262 flow dynamics and membrane tension without any signalling processes . Signalling sets the parameters of this system 263 and thus determines the dynamic regime ( steady , excitable or oscillatory ) and the cell velocity . A representation of 264 the net effect of integrin signalling on drag and friction coefficients by Hill functions is the third constituent of the 265 theory ( Eqs . S17 , S18 ) . Integrin signalling together with friction and force balance determine the adhesion - velocity 266 relation [ 30 ] . We know from Schreiber et al . [ 30 ] , that a large part of cell type specific detail enters via this signalling 267 constituent . 268 We were able to reach good quantitative agreement between simulations and experimental results with a single 269 parameter set for control experiments and changes to parameter values describing drug applications corresponding 270 13 to the known biochemical action of the drug . We could reach good agreement with regard to the types of states , the 271 ( temporal ) characteristics of states , state fractions and transition probabilities , characteristics of reversal behaviour , 272 the UCSP , protrusion stability , the adhesion - velocity relation and the behaviour on Fibronectin steps . The large 273 variety of observations agreeing between theory and experiment is a major reason for our assumption that we assem - 274 bled the model constituents dominating the observed behaviour , and that the mechanisms we suggest recapitulate 275 the cellular processes . We review and discuss alternative mechanisms from literature in the supplement Section S13 . 276 Our experimental data confirm the UCSP for MDA - MB - 231 cells and thus add another cell type to the many 277 listed in Maiuri et al . [ 34 ] obeying this relation . Fast cells are more persistent than slow ones . Maiuri et al . explain the 278 UCSP by a mechanism centered around the network extension rate : the fast network extension in fast cells advects 279 an F - actin - binding inhibitor of network growth away from the protrusion tip and thus renders random protrusion 280 collapse unlikely . Maiuri et al . conclude that the faster the network extension rate the more persistent the cell 281 moves [ 34 ] . However , the data in Maiuri et al . from mature bone marrow dendritic cells migrating in a confined 282 environment exhibiting a positive correlation between network extension rate and persistence time do not obey the 283 UCSP [ 34 ] . Furthermore , an endogenous F - actin binding inhibitor of network extension has not been identified . 284 Contrary to these ideas , reduction of the network extension rate by Latrunculin entails an increase in persistence in 285 our experiments and model . We found retrograde flow to be the most important indicator of stability ( Fig . 5D ) . With 286 our approach and our data , the noisy clutch is sufficient to explain the UCSP by spontaneous direction reversals 287 based on protrusion competition . 288 The mechanism suggested by Maiuri et al . implies that increasing network extension rate necessarily accompanies 289 increasing protrusion velocity , i . e . the authors require proportionality of the velocities v e = av f with a being constant 290 across experimental conditions . Direct measurement of protrusion velocity and retrograde flow in keratocytes [ 33 ] 291 and PtK1 cells [ 25 ] , and the theoretical analysis of adhesion - velocity relations for keratocytes , PtK1 cells , CHO cells 292 and MDA - MB - 231 cells [ 30 ] come to the conclusion that this proportionality is violated . For example , increasing 293 adhesion strength can reduce retrograde flow entailing increasing protrusion velocity with constant or even decreasing 294 network extension rate . Data by Jurado et al . [ 76 ] and Vicente - Manzanares et al . [ 11 ] report the relation v e = v r , f + v f 295 ( our Eq . S5 ) , which is different from proportionality since all three velocities depend on experimental conditions ( see 296 also Fig . S2F ) . Eq . S5 is obvious by geometrical reasons ( Fig . 2 ) and also compatible with a variety of measured 297 adhesion - velocity relations [ 30 ] . 298 The stationary force - velocity relation of cell motion represents the cell response to external force and therefore a 299 basic cell property . Due to technical problems of controlling either force or cell velocity to stay constant , it has not 300 been measured yet , in difference to measurements and analyses of the dynamic relation , which allows both parameters 301 to change during the experiment [ 19 , 20 , 21 ] . Our results are very similar to relations predicted earlier [ 60 , 30 ] . All 302 predictions agree in the point that the stationary relation reflects the retrograde flow friction law [ 60 , 30 ] . 303 We suggest as a main conclusion of our study that the basic phenomena multistability with its dynamic regimes , 304 14 adhesion - velocity relation and UCSP can all be explained on the basis of the three model constituents force balance 305 at the protrusion edges , noisy clutch and integrin signalling . They also entail a specific prediction for the stationary 306 force - velocity relation of cell motion . All three model constituents are observations which have been established 307 earlier and in other contexts . Our study connects them and thus reveals their explanatory power . The universality 308 of the model constituents offers a simple explanation for the universality of the constitutive relations . 309 3 Methods 310 3 . 1 Cell culture 311 We cultured MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells stably transduced with histone - 2B mCherry ( gift from Timo Betz , 312 WWU Münster ) in L15 medium with 2 mM Glutamax ( Thermo Fisher ) plus 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Thermo Fisher ) 313 at 37 °C . Cells were passaged every 2 - 3 days using Accutase ( Thermo Fisher ) . For experiments about 5000 cells 314 were seeded per dish . After 2 - 3 h cells adhered to the micropatterns and we exchanged the medium to L15 medium 315 without phenol red . Then , we transferred the samples to the microscope and started measurements within 1 - 2 h . 316 For inhibitor experiments 10 µ M ( + / - ) - Blebbistatin ( Cayman Chemicals ) , 100 nM Latrunculin A ( Merck ) , 0 . 25 nM 317 Calyculin A ( Thermo Fisher ) were added 2 h before the start of the experiment . As control we used DMSO ( life 318 technologies ) equal to the amount used for the dilution of the inhibitors . 319 3 . 2 Micropatterning 320 15 µ m wide lanes which were homogeneously coated with Fibronectin ( FN ) were applied on an imaging dish with a 321 polymer coverslip bottom ( ibidi ) using a micro - contact printing protocol . The production of the polydimethylsiloxane 322 ( PDMS ) stamps and the subsequent printing has been described previously [ 80 ] . For all experiments a range of FN 323 densities was covered . 324 3 . 3 Determination of Fibronectin densities 325 We determined the Fibronectin density via fluorescence intensity as described previously by us [ 30 ] . Lyophilised 326 FN batches were resuspended and conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 NHS ester ( Thermo Fisher ) . We measured the 327 concentration of FN in solution by optical absorption at 280 nm ( Nanodrop , Thermo Fisher ) . The calibration factor 328 that enables the conversion of fluorescence intensity to FN density was determined using microfluidic channel slides 329 that were filled with a FN solution of known concentration . 330 15 3 . 4 Microscopy 331 We performed time - lapse imaging on an inverted fluorescence microscope ( Nikon Eclipse Ti ) equipped with an XY - 332 motorised stage and a heating chamber ( Okolab ) set to 37 ◦ C . Imaging was done using a 10x CFI Plan Fluor DL 333 objective ( Nikon ) , a CMOS camera ( PCO edge 4 . 2 ) and the acquisition software NIS Elements ( Nikon ) . Before the 334 start of the time - lapse measurement epi - fluorescence images of the FN patterns were taken . Then , phase contrast 335 images and epi - fluorescence images of the cell nuclei were taken for 48 h at 10 min or 30 s intervals as indicated in 336 the text . 337 3 . 5 Image analysis 338 Image analysis was performed using a combination of MATLAB R2020a ( MathWorks ) scripts and FIJI ( ImageJ ) 339 macros , based on previous work [ 30 ] . Fibronectin lanes are detected using a Hough transformation of the fluorescence 340 signal of the labelled Fibronectin . The position of the nuclei is tracked by setting a threshold after applying a 341 background correction and band - pass filter to the fluorescent images of the nuclei . The coordinates of the nuclei 342 are converted such that the x - coordinates are parallel to the Fibronectin lanes . The position of the front and back 343 of the cells is determined via kymographs that are created along the centre of the FN lane . Then the cell edge is 344 manually segmented . Code used to generate results in the current study is available from the corresponding authors 345 upon reasonable request . 346 3 . 6 Biophysical Model 347 We define the model constituents and their rate laws in this section . This will result in differential equations for 348 the protrusion lengths L f , b and friction coefficients κ f , b for the front ( f ) and back ( b ) protrusion . Protrusion edge 349 velocities v f , b , cell body velocity v c , retrograde flow velocities v r , f , v r , b and protrusion edge forces F f , b are determined 350 by algebraic equations of L f , b and κ f , b , all listed in the supplement . Algebraic equations also relate the parameters 351 of these dynamics to integrin signalling and the Fibronectin density . 352 Motivated by the observations presented in Fig . 1 , we formulate a cell model with front and back protrusions 353 moving on a 1d Fibronectin lane ( Fig . 2A ) . The model is based in part on our previous work on steady cell motion 354 in Schreiber et al . [ 30 ] . The main extensions of the model compared to Schreiber et al . [ 30 ] are the cell body , the 355 back protrusion and the noisy clutch . The requirement for the noisy clutch from a modelling point of view follows 356 from the dynamics we consider here , while we considered stationary properties in [ 30 ] . 357 The force balances ( see Eqs . S2 - S4 and Fig . 2A ) applying to the front and back edge and cell body have been 358 established in a variety of studies [ 73 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 74 , 75 , 60 , 81 ] . They comprise the drag forces resisting motion 359 ζ f , b v f , b and ζ c v c , the retrograde flow friction force κ f , b v r , f , b and the elastic forces ( Fig . 2A ) . The drag coefficients ζ f , b , c 360 and the retrograde flow friction coefficients κ f , b are affected by adhesion and integrin signalling ( Eqs . 2 , 3 , S17 , S18 ) . 361 16 The cell body velocity v c is determined by the forces acting on it from front and back protrusions and the drag 362 coefficient of the cell body ζ c . 363 We choose a linear dependency of the force between protrusion edges and cell body on the protrusion length 364 ( elastic force ) based on the results in [ 30 ] ( see Eqs . S2 - S4 ) and [ 42 ] . We assume that the force is transmitted by 365 membrane tension and consider as its most likely cause volume homeostasis in 1d [ 82 ] . 366 The network extension rate v e is equal to the vectorial difference of the edge velocity and retrograde flow velocity . 367 It is fixed by polymerisation , which is force dependent with the well known Arrhenius factor [ 73 , 75 , 83 ] ( see Eqs . 368 S5 , S6 ) . 369 The lengths of the protrusions L f , b are dynamic due to velocity differences between the edges and the cell body dL f dt = v f − v c , dL b dt = v c − v b . ( 1 ) The noisy clutch has been reported in a variety of studies [ 84 , 85 , 86 , 76 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 61 ] and is due to the 370 retrograde motion of the treadmilling F - actin network inside the protrusion [ 87 , 16 , 88 ] . This flow causes friction 371 with all structures relative to which it moves , in particular also with stress fibres and the intracellular interface of 372 adhesion sites [ 76 , 89 , 90 ] . The friction of the F - actin flow transmits the protrusion force to the substrate [ 91 , 31 , 373 92 , 77 , 90 , 89 , 76 , 21 ] . The value of the friction coefficient can be perceived as the state of the clutch , with large 374 values corresponding to an engaged and low values to a disengaged state . 375 The relation between friction force and retrograde flow velocity exhibits increasing friction force at small velocities 376 up to a critical velocity value v r , cr beyond which friction force decreases ( Fig . 2A , Eq . S19 ) . The force maximum 377 entails stick - slip transitions of sudden acceleration at the critical velocity due to the decrease of the force resisting 378 motion while the force driving motion is maintained . Stick - slip behaviour is a versatile phenomenon generating sound 379 in bowed string instruments [ 62 , 63 ] , causing earthquakes [ 93 ] and wear in articular joints [ 94 ] . Recent theoretical 380 studies suggested it to be relevant also for protrusion dynamics [ 61 , 65 , 66 , 52 , 51 , 42 ] and polarisation [ 65 , 52 , 42 ] . 381 The friction force is proportional to the number of transient bonds between the F - actin network and stationary structures in the protrusion . Its biphasic character is due to fast dissociation of these bonds at fast retrograde flow ( the clutch disengages ) [ 95 ] . They have to rebind to reach their equilibrium density after a high velocity phase . This motivates the κ dynamics adapted from [ 61 ] dκ f dt = c 1 ( κ limf − ( κ f − κ 0 ) ) − c 2 e | vr , f | c 3 ( κ f − κ 0 ) + η f ( t ) ( 2 ) dκ b dt = c 1 ( κ limb − ( κ b − κ 0 ) ) − c 2 e | vr , b | c 3 ( κ b − κ 0 ) + η b ( t ) , ( 3 ) with an exponential acceleration of bond dissociation by retrograde flow velocity c 2 e | vr , b | c 3 [ 95 ] . 382 The maximum values κ lim f , b of κ f , b and ζ f , b exhibit a Hill - type relation to the Fibronectin substrate density B f , b , c , 383 17 as specified by Eqs . S17 , S18 . This type of relation has been concluded from an earlier analysis of the adhesion - 384 velocity relation [ 30 ] . As justified in detail in section 1 . 3 , we assume that bond formation and breakage cause some 385 noise on top of the deterministic dynamics , and added the noise terms η f ( t ) and η b ( t ) ( see also Eq . S16 ) . The 386 stationary states of Eqs . 2 , 3 represent the biphasic friction force - retrograde flow velocity relation Eq . S19 . The 387 detailed equations are provided in the supplementary material .
