The Caenorhabditis elegans unc - 60 gene en - codes two functionally distinct isoforms of ADF / coﬁlin that are implicated in myoﬁbril assembly . Here , we show that one of the gene products , UNC - 60B , is specif - ically required for proper assembly of actin into myo - ﬁbrils . We found that all homozygous viable unc - 60 mu - tations resided in the unc - 60B coding region , indicating that UNC - 60B is responsible for the Unc - 60 phenotype . Wild - type UNC - 60B had F - actin binding , partial actin depolymerizing , and weak F - actin severing activities in vitro . However , mutations in UNC - 60B caused various alterations in these activities . Three missense mutations resulted in weaker F - actin binding and actin depoly - merizing activities and complete loss of severing activ - ity . The r398 mutation truncated three residues from the COOH terminus and resulted in the loss of severing activity and greater actin depolymerizing activity . The s1307 mutation in a putative actin - binding helix caused greater activity in actin - depolymerizing and severing . Using a speciﬁc antibody for UNC - 60B , we found vary - ing protein levels of UNC - 60B in mutant animals , and that UNC - 60B was expressed in embryonic muscles . Regardless of these various molecular phenotypes , ac - tin was not properly assembled into embryonic myo - ﬁbrils in all unc - 60 mutants to similar extents . We con - clude that precise control of actin ﬁlament dynamics by UNC - 60B is required for proper integration of actin into myoﬁbrils . Key words : myoﬁbrils • thin ﬁlaments • ADF / coﬁlin • actin polymerization • unc - 60 I N striated muscles , actin and myosin are precisely aligned in a striated pattern so that they coordinately generate contractile forces . During the development of myofibrils , the assembly of these contractile proteins must be accurately regulated , but little is known about its mechanism . To control the uniform length of thin fila - ments , tropomodulin , which caps pointed ends of actin fil - aments , has been shown to be required ( Gregorio et al . , 1995 ) . CapZ , a barbed end actin - capping protein is also in - volved in myofibril assembly ( Schafer et al . , 1995 ) , which probably terminates actin assembly ( Eddy et al . , 1997 ) and regulates the length of actin filaments ( Xu et al . , 1999 ) . Another important issue in myofibrillogenesis is how the assembly of actin into myofibrils is regulated . The as - sembly of actin in embryonic skeletal muscle is negatively regulated . Consequently , (cid:122) 40 % of actin is present in a monomeric form ( Shimizu and Obinata , 1986 ) . However , as muscle develops , the concentration of monomeric actin decreases , while the total amount of actin increases by 10 - fold in adult muscle ( Shimizu and Obinata , 1986 ) , indicat - ing that myofibrillar actin is assembled from the monomer pool of both existing and newly synthesized actin mole - cules in developing muscle . In chicken embryonic skeletal muscle , profilin ( Ohshima et al . , 1989 ) , actin depolymeriz - ing factor ( ADF 1 ) ( Abe and Obinata , 1989 ) , and cofilin ( Abe et al . , 1989 ) have been identified as G - actin binding proteins that are postulated to regulate actin assembly into myofibrils . In addition , mammalian skeletal muscles ex - press a muscle - specific isoform of cofilin ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) , implicating its role during myofibril assembly . How - ever , how the assembly of actin is initiated and how these actin binding proteins are involved in the process of actin assembly are not understood .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 492 ADF ( Bamburg et al . , 1980 ) and cofilin ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) are homologous proteins and belong to the ADF / co - filin family ( Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) . They have been shown to bind to both G - and F - actin at a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 and enhance turnover of actin subunits within actin fil - aments by severing F - actin and increasing the off rate of actin subunits from the pointed ends ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Du and Frieden , 1998 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 , 1998 ) . ADF / cofilin is necessary for cytokinesis ( Abe et al . , 1996 ; Gun - salus et al . , 1995 ) , actin turnover in comet tails of Listeria monocytogenes ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Rosenblatt et al . , 1997 ) , and for in vivo actin turnover in yeast ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , overexpression of cofilin in Dic - tyostelium enhances cell motility ( Aizawa et al . , 1996 ) . These observations show that ADF / cofilin regulates dy - namic aspects of the actin cytoskeleton in vivo . A study us - ing systematic mutagenesis of yeast cofilin has shown that actin - depolymerizing activity of cofilin is essential for its in vivo function ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Lappa - lainen et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , multiple isoforms of ADF / cofilin have been found in vertebrates , C . elegans , and maize , and show different patterns of tissue distribution ( Moriyama et al . , 1990 ; Hayakawa et al . , 1993 ; McKim et al . , 1994 ; Ono et al . , 1994 ; Lopez et al . , 1996 ) . Interestingly , expression of a mammalian muscle - specific isoform ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) and maize pollen – specific isoforms ( Lopez et al . , 1996 ) are restricted in particular differentiated tissues , suggesting their specialized roles in the regulation of cer - tain types of actin cytoskeleton . To understand the in vivo regulation of actin assembly , we have taken genetic and biochemical approaches to ana - lyze the C . elegans unc - 60 mutants that show abnormal as - sembly of actin filaments in muscle cells ( Waterston et al . , 1980 ; McKim et al . , 1988 ) . Two isoforms of ADF / cofilin , UNC - 60A , and UNC - 60B , are generated by alternative splicing from the unc - 60 gene ( McKim et al . , 1994 ) and have different effects on rabbit muscle actin in vitro ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) . UNC - 60A shows actin - depolymerizing activity and an inhibitory effect on actin polymerization , whereas UNC - 60B binds to F - actin without significantly depolymerizing it and accelerates actin polymerization ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) . These properties of UNC - 60A and UNC - 60B strongly suggest that they are functionally distinct in vivo . Here , we report that UNC - 60B is required for myofibril assembly and its normal function is to regu - late a dynamic state of actin filaments . Our results provide the first evidence of an isoform - specific requirement of ADF / cofilin for assembly of a differentiated actin cyto - skeleton . Materials and Methods Nematode Strains Wild - type C . elegans strain N2 was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Ge - netics stock center . unc - 60 mutants were obtained from various colleagues and their origins were described previously ( McKim et al . , 1988 ) . All mu - tant animals used in this study were homozygous for each allele . Motility Assay A motility assay was performed as described by Epstein and Thomson ( 1974 ) . In brief , adult nematodes carrying eggs in a single row were placed in a droplet ( 10 (cid:109) l ) of M9 buffer . One beat was counted when a worm swung its head to either right or left . The total number of beats in 1 min was recorded . The data were taken only when the worms kept beating for 1 min . Sequencing of Genomic DNA Genomic DNA for unc - 60A ( 1 kb ) and unc - 60B ( 2 . 5 kb ) were amplified from two adult worms from each strain ( Barstead and Waterston , 1991 ) with Pfu DNA polymerase ( Stratagene Inc . ) and all of the exons were se - quenced with an automated sequencer ( ABI373 ) . Sequencing was per - formed on at least two independent PCR products to insure that there were no PCR - induced errors . After we identified the mutation sites in e677 , m35 , and r398 , we focused only on unc - 60B because a fine structure map showed that the other mutations were located between e677 and m35 ( McKim et al . , 1988 ) . Production and Purification of Recombinant Mutant Proteins Site - directed mutagenesis was performed on pET - UNC - 60B ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) , a bacterial expression construct for wild type ( that ex - presses UNC - 60B without any additional sequences ) , with a mutagenesis kit ( Quick - change ; Stratagene ) . Recombinant proteins except UNC - 60B ( m35 ) were expressed and purified as described previously for wild - type UNC - 60B ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) . Because a large portion of UNC - 60B ( m35 ) was insoluble after induction of expression , the insoluble proteins were solubilized by 6 M urea . After urea was removed by dialysis , the pro - tein was purified with DEAE - cellulose ( DE - 52 ; Whatman ) , followed by gel filtration ( Sephacryl S - 200 ; Pharmacia Biotech ) . The concentrations of UNC - 60B proteins were spectrophotometrically determined using a cal - culated extinction coefficient ( Gill and von Hippel , 1989 ) of 8 , 040 M (cid:50) 1 cm (cid:50) 1 at 280 nm . Actin Binding Assays Actin was purified from wild - type C . elegans as described previously ( Ono , 1999 ) . This actin preparation probably contains both muscle and nonmuscle actins . Nonetheless , we expect that most of this actin prepara - tion consists of the muscle isoforms because of extensive extraction of nematodes in the early steps of the purification ( for review see Ono , 1999 ) . C . elegans actin was used in this study because UNC - 60B interacts with C . elegans actin differently than rabbit muscle actin ( Ono , 1999 ) . Copelleting assays of wild - type and mutant UNC - 60B proteins with C . ele - gans F - actin were performed as described previously ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) in a buffer containing 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 . Ultracentrifugation was performed with a Beck - man Airfuge at 28 psi for 20 min . Control experiments were performed by replacing actin with 0 . 4 mg / ml BSA and nonspecific sedimentations of wild - type and mutant UNC - 60B proteins were determined and subtracted from the data of the assays with actin . For the actin polymerization assays , C . elegans G - actin at 5 (cid:109) M was incubated with UNC - 60B proteins for 2 min in a buffer containing 2 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 , and polymerization was initiated at time 0 by adding salts at final concentrations of 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 . The kinetics of actin polymerization were monitored as changes in turbidity at a wavelength of 310 nm ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) at 20 (cid:56) C . To determine the effects of UNC - 60B proteins on the ex - tent of actin polymerization , C . elegans G - actin at 5 (cid:109) M was polymerized in the presence of UNC - 60B proteins in a buffer containing 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , for 4 h and the concentrations of the remaining G - actin were quantified with a DNase I inhibition assay as described ( Blikstad et al . , 1978 ; Heacock and Bamburg , 1983 ) . It was established previously ( Ono , 1999 ) that a DNase I inhibition assay is a valid measurement of C . elegans G - actin concentration . Assay for Nucleation of Actin Polymerization To determine whether wild - type and mutant UNC - 60B proteins sever ac - tin filaments and increase the filament ends , effects of UNC - 60B proteins on the activity of F - actin to nucleate actin polymerization were examined as described ( Hawkins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ; Maciver et al . , 1998 ) . C . elegans F - actin at 10 (cid:109) M was mixed for 30 s with 0 – 10 (cid:109) M of wild - type or mutant UNC - 60B in a buffer containing 0 . 1 M KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 20 mM Hepes - NaOH , pH 7 . 5 . These Ono et al . Role of ADF / Cofilin in Myofibril Assembly 493 mixtures were added as nuclei at 1 . 25 (cid:109) M actin to 2 . 5 (cid:109) M pyrene - labeled G - actin and the changes in fluorescence of excitation at 366 nm and emis - sion at 384 nm were monitored over time . The rates of nucleation for actin polymerization were determined as the initial rates of the increase in fluo - rescence intensity . The nucleation rates in the presence of UNC - 60B pro - teins were divided by the rate of F - actin alone and expressed as the rela - tive nucleation rates in Fig . 5 . Pyrene - actin was prepared by labeling rabbit muscle actin with N - ( 1 - pyrene ) iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes Inc . ) by the method of Kouyama and Mihashi ( 1981 ) and finally purified by gel filtration with Sephacryl S - 300 . The labeled G - actin was mixed with nonlabeled G - actin to make 10 % pyrene - labeled G - actin and converted to MgATP – actin by incubating 5 (cid:109) M of G - actin with 15 (cid:109) M MgCl 2 and 0 . 2 mM EGTA for 3 min before the assay . Production of Antibodies Synthetic peptides that correspond to 15 amino acids from the COOH ter - minus of UNC - 60A and UNC - 60B and cysteine at the NH 2 terminus were synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by the Micro - chemical Facility at Emory University . The rabbit antisera against these conjugates were raised at Spring Valley Laboratories , Inc . , and affinity - purified with Sepharose - 6B columns to which the synthetic peptides had been immobilized . Western Blot Total SDS - soluble protein extracts from each strain ( mostly adults ) were prepared as described in Benian et al . ( 1996 ) . Protein concentrations were determined by a filter paper dye - binding assay ( Minamide and Bamburg , 1990 ) . 10 (cid:109) g of each lysate was separated on a 15 % SDS – polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane ( Immo - bilon - P ; Millipore Corp . ) . The membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat milk in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with anti – UNC - 60A , anti – UNC - 60B , or antiactin ( clone C4 ; ICN Pharmaceuticals , Inc . ) antibodies followed by treatment with peroxidase - labeled donkey anti – rabbit or mouse IgG ( Amersham Life Science ) . The reactivities were detected with a chemiluminescence reagent ( Renaissance ; NEN ) . Immunofluorescence Microscopy Immunofluorescent staining of whole adult nematodes was performed es - sentially as described ( Benian et al . , 1996 ) . Immunofluorescent staining of embryos was performed by two methods . For double staining of myosin and UNC - 60B , embryos were obtained by cutting gravid adults on poly - lysine - coated slides , freeze - cracked as described ( Albertson , 1984 ; Epstein et al . , 1993 ) , fixed with (cid:50) 20 (cid:56) C methanol for 5 min , washed with PBS , and incubated with antibodies . The staining of actin was performed using the method of Barstead and Waterston ( 1991 ) with slight modifications . In brief , embryos were collected by a hypochlorite treatment of gravid adults , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min , permeabilized with (cid:50) 20 (cid:56) C methanol for 5 min , washed with PBS and 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , and incubated with antibodies . In addition to anti – UNC - 60B , we used an - timyosin A mAb ( clone 5 . 6 ) ( Miller et al . , 1983 ) and antiactin mAb ( clone C4 ; ICN Pharmaceuticals , Inc . ) . Results Identification of UNC - 60B as the Responsible Isoform for the Unc - 60 Phenotype To understand the function of a particular gene , availabil - ity of several different alleles allows us to correlate the properties of the gene products and the phenotypes . Via - ble unc - 60 alleles were previously described ( Waterston et al . , 1980 ; McKim et al . , 1988 ) and the homozygous mu - tant animals show a wide range of phenotypic severity based on mobility ( Fig . 1 A , Table I ) . Based upon our quantitative motility assay , they are from strongest to weakest alleles : e677 , m35 , s1309 , r398 , and s1307 . All of them are recessive and hypomorphic because they exhibit more severe phenotypes when placed over a deficiency ( McKim et al . , 1988 ) , suggesting that the mutations cause partial defects in the function of the unc - 60 gene product . Sequence analyses of the genomic DNA from the unc - 60 mutants showed that mutations in the unc - 60B but not in the unc - 60A coding region cause the Unc - 60 pheno - types ( Fig . 1 B ) . s1309 , m35 , and s1307 have missense mu - tations within a region homologous in sequence to the (cid:97) - helix that contains the putative actin - binding surface of the members of the ADF / cofilin family for which struc - tures have been solved ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991 ; Hatanka et al , 1996 ; Fedorov et al . , 1997 ; Leonard et al . , 1997 ; Van Troys et al . , 1997 ) . e723 , s1310 , and s1331 have the same mutation as m35 . The missense mutation in e677 lies close to the NH 2 terminus . r398 has a premature stop codon that truncates three amino acids from the COOH terminus . Both the NH 2 terminus and the COOH terminus of ADF / cofilin have been implicated in binding to actin ( Lappa - lainen et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , these sequence alterations sug - gest that the actin - binding activity of UNC - 60B is changed in the unc - 60 mutants , but these alterations do not allow us to correlate the properties of the mutant proteins with the phenotypes . Therefore , we produced recombinant mutant UNC - 60B proteins and examined their activities in vitro . Effects of Mutant UNC - 60B Proteins on F - actin Mutant UNC - 60B proteins showed various alterations in Figure 1 . Motility of unc - 60 mutants and identification of muta - tion sites . ( A ) Motility of the adult unc - 60 mutant animals were scored by their beating frequencies in liquid . Values are the means (cid:54) SD , n (cid:53) 10 . ( B ) Sequence alterations in the unc - 60 mu - tants . The mutations are designated as the original residue , the position , the converted residue . The asterisk designates a stop codon . The gray region shows a putative actin - binding (cid:97) - helix that was predicted from the homology between UNC - 60B and yeast cofilin for which a structure has been solved . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 494 their effects on F - actin as compared with wild type . Wild - type UNC - 60B partially depolymerizes and also binds to C . elegans F - actin ( Ono , 1999 ; Fig . 2 A ) . The extent of de - polymerization of F - actin was consistent regardless of the concentration of UNC - 60B and binding of UNC - 60B to F - actin was saturated at a 1 : 1 molar ratio . e677 , m35 , and s1309 showed weaker activities in both partial depolymer - ization and F - actin binding than wild type ( Fig . 2 , B – D ) . Maximum depolymerization was achieved by 5 (cid:109) M of wild type ( Fig . 2 A ) , but e677 and s1309 required 10 and 20 (cid:109) M to reach the same level of depolymerization ( Fig . 2 , B and D ) . m35 did not cause the equivalent level of depolymer - ization even at an extremely high concentration ( 80 (cid:109) M , Fig . 2 C ) . These weak actin - depolymerization phenotypes probably indicate weak affinities of these mutants with ADP – G - actin . Weak binding of these mutants to F - actin was obvious because the amounts of these mutants that cosedimented with F - actin were lower than wild type at any equivalent concentrations examined here . Binding of m35 and s1309 to F - actin was so weak that saturation was not reached until 50 to 80 (cid:109) M ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . Both r398 and s1307 showed stronger actin - depolymer - izing and weaker F - actin binding than wild type ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . When the concentrations of these mutants were in - creased , more F - actin was depolymerized ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . In contrast , these mutants were poorly cosedimented with F - actin . However , a marked difference between these mutants was detected in the extent of depolymerization when their concentrations were substoichiometric to actin . At 5 (cid:109) M of the mutants to 10 (cid:109) M of F - actin , s1307 showed greater actin - depolymerizing activity than r398 ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . Effects of Mutant UNC - 60B Proteins on Actin Polymerization Wild - type UNC - 60B strongly accelerated the rate of spon - taneous polymerization of C . elegans actin ( Fig . 3 A ) . However , all the mutant proteins were less potent in this effect than wild type to different extents ( Fig . 3 , B – F ) . In the presence of wild - type UNC - 60B , the elongation phase of actin polymerization ( 200 – 1 , 000 s ) was accelerated and the kinetics reached a plateau much earlier than actin alone ( Fig . 3 A ) . This effect was obvious when UNC - 60B was present at a concentration as low as 20 % of actin in a molar ratio . The increases in turbidity in the later phase ( after 1 , 000 s ) were caused by binding of UNC - 60B to F - actin that resulted in an increase in the mass of actin fil - aments ( Carlier et al . , 1997 and we confirmed by a pellet - ing assay ) . In contrast , m35 and s1309 showed only minor effects on the kinetics when these mutants were present at 1 : 1 molar ratio to actin ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . Interestingly , r398 had an inhibitory effect on the polymerization kinet - ics ( Fig . 3 E ) . Although e677 and s1307 accelerated poly - merization kinetics , both of them did not cause strong ef - fects when they were present at 20 % of actin , at which wild type can accelerate polymerization ( Fig . 3 , B and F , compare with A ) . In addition , acceleration by e677 was less steep than wild type at the equivalent concentrations ( Fig . 3 B ) . Acceleration by s1307 was comparable to the effect of wild type , whereas the timing when the accelera - tion began was later for s1307 ( 500 – 600 s ) than for wild type ( 200 s ) ( Fig . 3 F ) . Effects of wild - type and mutant UNC - 60B proteins on the concentration of unassembled actin at steady state were determined quantitatively by a DNase I inhibition assay . In the presence of wild - type UNC - 60B , the concentration of G - actin was increased ( Fig . 4 , closed circles ) . However , all the mutant proteins at 1 (cid:109) M did not increase the con - centration of G - actin in 5 (cid:109) M of total actin ( Fig . 4 ) . m35 and s1309 did not affect the level of G - actin at any concen - trations examined in this study . e677 and r398 increased the G - actin level to lesser extents than wild type only when they were present at 1 : 1 molar ratio to actin ( Fig . 4 , open circles and closed squares ) . Therefore , m35 , s1309 , e677 , and r398 are less active than wild type in this re - gard . However , s1307 increased the G - actin concentration greater than wild type when s1307 was present at (cid:46) 50 % of actin ( Fig . 4 , open squares ) . Therefore , s1307 is less active than wild type at low concentrations , but at high concen - trations it shows hyperactivity in increasing the level of un - polymerized actin . Table I .

Role of ADF / Cofilin in Myofibril Assembly 495 Severing Activities of Mutant UNC - 60B Proteins Acceleration of actin polymerization by ADF / cofilin has been interpreted as its severing activity that increases fila - ment ends ( Du and Frieden , 1998 ; Maciver et al . , 1991 , 1998 ) . Therefore , we tested whether wild - type and mutant UNC - 60B sever actin filaments . As shown in Fig . 5 inset ( closed circles ) , the elongation rate of actin polymeriza - tion from F - actin nuclei was increased by preincubating the nuclei with wild - type UNC - 60B . This effect can be ex - plained by fragmentation of the F - actin nuclei by UNC - 60B that increased the number of filament ends ( Maciver et al . , 1998 ) . The rate was increased by 30 % at a 1 : 1 molar ratio of UNC - 60B to actin subunits , suggesting that UNC - 60B weakly severs actin filaments . In contrast , the s1307 mutant remarkably increased the elongation rate to a much greater extent than wild type ( Fig . 5 , open squares ) . There was a threefold increase in the elongation rate at a 1 : 1 molar ratio of s1307 to actin subunits , indicating that this mutant has much stronger actin - severing activity than wild type . The other mutants , e677 , m35 , s1309 , and r398 did not increase the elongation rates ( Fig . 5 ) . It should be noted that r398 decreased the elongation rate ( Fig . 5 inset ) , sug - gesting that some actin filaments were depolymerized without being severed . These data provide supportive evi - dence for the turbidity measurements in Fig . 3 that wild type and s1307 enhanced actin polymerization by severing actin filaments , whereas e677 , m35 , and s1309 increased the turbidity by decorating actin filaments . However , a four - to fivefold increase in the polymerization rate in the presence of wild - type UNC - 60B ( Fig . 3 A ) cannot be fully explained by a weak severing activity ( a maximum of 30 % increase in filament ends ) . Therefore , wild - type UNC - 60B may also enhance association of actin monomers to barbed ends of actin filaments as reported for Arabidopsis ADF1 ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ) . Our observations and inter - pretations are inconsistent with the report by Du and Frieden ( 1998 ) that fragmentation of actin filaments by yeast cofilin is sufficient to explain the enhanced rate of actin polymerization with the assumption that cofilin Figure 2 . Effects of the mutant UNC - 60B proteins on F - actin . C . elegans F - actin ( 10 (cid:109) M ) was incubated with various concentrations of wild - type or mutant UNC - 60B proteins ( horizontal axes ; note that the scaling of C and D is different from the others ) and the mix - tures were examined by copelleting as - says . On the vertical axes are plotted the sedimented portions ( expressed as concentrations assuming that the pel - lets were reconstituted in the original volumes ) of actin ( closed circles with solid lines ) and wild - type or mutant UNC - 60B ( open circles with dashed lines ) . Nonspecific sedimentations of wild - type or mutant UNC - 60B were determined by control experiments as described in Materials and Methods and subtracted from the data of assays with actin . Data represent the average of two separate experiments . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 496 tightly binds ATP - G - actin and prevents polymerization . This inconsistency needs to be clarified by considering dif - ferences in experimental conditions , methods of analysis , and possible variances in the biochemical properties of ADF / cofilin isoforms . Mutations in unc - 60 Affect the Protein Levels of UNC - 60B As tools to identify UNC - 60 proteins , we produced spe - cific antibodies against UNC - 60A and B using synthetic peptides as antigens ( Fig . 6 A ) . Western blot analyses us - ing these antibodies showed that the levels of UNC - 60A were consistent among the homozygous mutant animals , whereas those of UNC - 60B were variable ( Fig . 6 B , Table I ) . The mutants , m35 and s1307 , contained moderately in - creased levels of UNC - 60B as compared with wild type ( Fig . 6 B , lanes 3 and 5 ) . However , r398 and s1309 con - tained three - and fourfold larger amounts of UNC - 60B as compared with wild type ( Fig . 6 B , lanes 4 and 6 ) . In con - trast , e677 had (cid:44) 10 % ( the lower limit of quantification of this Western blot ) of UNC - 60B as wild type ( Fig . 6 B , lane 2 ) . Although the band of UNC - 60B in e677 is not visible in Fig . 6 B , it appeared after a longer exposure of the blot . UNC - 60B Is Expressed in Embryonic Body Wall Muscle UNC - 60B was expressed in embryonic body wall muscle cells , supporting its function as an essential regulator of myofibril assembly during development . Although weak maternal expression of UNC - 60B was observed ( data not shown ) , its expression was remarkably upregulated in de - veloping body wall muscle cells from the 1 . 5 - fold stage ( Fig . 7 , a and b ) , when nascent myosin filaments were formed before obvious striations of myofibrils were estab - lished ( Epstein et al . , 1993 ) . As myofibrils are assembled beneath the hypodermis in two - to threefold stages ( Fig . 7 d ) , UNC - 60B was localized both in diffuse cytoplasm and stri - ated myofibrils ( Fig . 7 c ) . The spindle - shaped outline of the muscle cells were visible by the UNC - 60B staining , but the nuclei were devoid of staining ( Fig . 7 c ) . In contrast , Figure 3 . Effects of the mu - tant UNC - 60B proteins on actin polymerization . C . ele - gans G - actin ( 5 (cid:109) M ) was in - cubated with the indicated molar ratios of wild - type or mutant UNC - 60B , polymer - ization was started by adding salt ( time 0 ) , and the rates of polymerization were mea - sured as changes in turbidity ( absorbance at 310 nm ) over time . Ono et al . Role of ADF / Cofilin in Myofibril Assembly 497 myosin staining was limited to the myofibrils . Because of the bright UNC - 60B staining of diffuse cytoplasm , local - ization of UNC - 60B in myofibrils was visible only in some areas of the image ( Fig . 7 c , arrow ) . These data indicate that most of UNC - 60B is diffusely located in the cyto - plasm of embryonic muscle cells , suggesting that UNC - 60B functions as a soluble regulator of actin polymeriza - tion in the cytoplasm of developing muscle cells . In wild - type threefold stage embryos , actin was localized in myofibrils and the striation patterns were evenly distrib - uted throughout the arrays of body wall muscle cells ( Fig . 8 a ) . The staining of UNC - 60B was found in body wall muscle cells in the same embryos , but it was diffuse and wider than the staining of actin , suggesting that UNC - 60B was diffusely localized in cytoplasm , whereas actin is mostly assembled into myofibrils . We have noticed that the formaldehyde - methanol fixation optimized for actin staining gives less sharp staining of UNC - 60B than the freeze - crack – methanol fixation ( shown in Fig . 7 ) . Espe - cially , striated staining of UNC - 60B and outlines of nuclei that were often clear by the freeze - crack – methanol fixa - tion ( Fig . 7 c ) were not preserved in the formaldehyde – methanol - fixed embryos ( Fig . 8 b ) . Disorganization of myofibrils was observed in embry - onic muscle cells of the unc - 60 mutants ( Fig . 8 ) . In the unc - 60 mutant embryos of the threefold stage , actin was found in discrete thick bundles that were not in the normal posi - tions of thin filaments ( Fig . 8 , c , e , and g ) . Although e677 shows a much more severe phenotype as adult worms than Figure 4 . Effects of the mutant proteins on the concentration of unassembled actin . C . elegans actin at 5 (cid:109) M was polymerized in the presence of wild - type or mutant UNC - 60B for 4 h and the concentration of unpolymerized actin was quantified with a DNase I inhibition assay . Data represent averages of three exper - iments . Error bars are not included in the figure because they make the graph difficult to read . SDs of these data are (cid:44) 0 . 17 (cid:109) M . Figure 5 . Effects of mutant UNC - 60B on the nu - cleating activity of F - actin . C . elegans F - actin was mixed with wild - type or mutant UNC - 60B and used as nuclei to induce polymerization of pyrene - labeled G - actin . The fluorescence of pyrene was measured over time and the initial rate of the increase in the fluorescence was taken as a nucleation rate . The inset is the same data with different scaling . The data are expressed as relative nucleation rates to that of F - actin alone . Data represent the average of two separate ex - periments . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 498 r398 ( Fig . 1 A ) , they exhibited similar degrees of disorga - nization of actin in embryonic stages . The weakest mutant , s1307 , also showed a high degree of disorganization of myofibrils in embryos ( Fig . 8 g ) . The aggregates of actin in s1307 were slightly larger than e677 and r398 , whereas the distribution of actin was discontinuous and was not found as organized myofibrils . In e677 , only a trace level of UNC - 60B protein was detected by the antibody staining ( Fig . 8 d ) , which is consistent with the result of Western blot ( Fig . 6 B ) . However , in r398 and s1307 , the immu - nostaining of UNC - 60B was indistinguishable from that of wild type although the staining was not quantitative . These results suggest that the proper function of UNC - 60B is critical for the process of actin filament assembly into myofibrils during embryonic stages . unc - 60 Mutants Show Aggregates of Actin and Disorganized Thick Filaments in Adult Body Wall Muscle In adult animals carrying unc - 60 mutations , myofibrils of body wall muscle were highly disorganized , but exhibited a variety of disorganization depending upon the mutant al - leles . In wild - type animals , myosin and actin were orga - nized into striated sarcomeres ( Fig . 9 , a and b ) . Some UNC - 60B was localized in a striated pattern ( Fig . 9 c ) and colocalized with actin by confocal microscopy ( data not shown , see Discussion for details ) . In contrast , in unc - 60 mutant animals , large aggregates of actin were found at the ends of body wall muscle cells and myosin was also dis - organized ( Fig . 9 , d – r ) . In the most severe mutant , e677 , most of the actin was associated with the aggregates ( Fig . 9 e ) and myosin failed to form clear striations ( Fig . 9 d ) . The staining of UNC – 60B was only found in small dots in the muscle cells ( Fig . 9 f ) , which was consistent with the low level of UNC - 60B protein as shown by the Western blot ( Fig . 6 B ) . In the second most severe mutant , m35 , myosin was relatively aligned in striations ( Fig . 9 g ) , al - though it was not as tight as in wild type ( Fig . 9 a ) . How - ever , most actin in m35 was included in the large aggre - gates with UNC - 60B and the occurrence of actin in striations was rare ( Fig . 9 h ) . In the intermediate mutants , s1309 and r398 , actin was found in the aggregates with UNC - 60B , whereas some actin formed a striated pattern ( Fig . 9 , k and l for s1309 , n and o for r398 ) . Myosin ( Fig . 9 , j and m ) was disorganized to similar extents as m35 ( Fig . 9 g ) . The weakest mutant , s1307 , showed relatively clear striations of myosin ( Fig . 9 p ) , although the width of the striations were often greater than in wild type . The striated pattern of actin was clearer than in any of the other mu - tants ( Fig . 9 q ) . Aggregates of actin in s1307 were smaller than in the other mutants ( Fig . 9 q ) . However , the mutant UNC - 60B was associated preferentially with the aggre - gates rather than the thin filaments ( Fig . 9 r ) . Thus , there was correlation between the severities in the slowness of movement and the extents of disorganization of myofibrils ( Fig . 1 A and Table I ) . However , it is likely that these vari - ous phenotypes in adult muscles were caused by effects in the growth and / or the maintenance of myofibrils , because these mutants showed similar phenotypes in embryonic stages . Discussion Here , we described an essential role of a particular iso - form of ADF / cofilin for proper assembly of actin into myofibrils . This was concluded from three major findings : mutations in UNC - 60B , one of the two ADF / cofilin iso - forms encoded by the unc - 60 gene , were sufficient to cause Figure 6 . Changes in UNC - 60B protein levels in unc - 60 mutants . ( A ) Specificity of anti – UNC - 60A and anti – UNC - 60B antibodies . Total lysates of wild - type nematodes were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred onto a membrane and reacted with anti – UNC - 60A or anti – UNC - 60B antibodies . Each antibody specifically reacted with a single band of expected size , which was further confirmed by reactivity with either recombinant UNC - 60A or UNC - 60B ( data not shown ) . Molecular mass markers in kD are indicated on the left . ( B ) Levels of UNC - 60A and UNC - 60B pro - teins in the unc - 60 mutant alleles . Only the level of UNC - 60B protein varied among the alleles . The intensities of the bands of UNC - 60B were quantified and shown in Table I . No alteration in the level of actin was observed .

( a – d ) Specific expression of UNC - 60B in embryonic body wall muscle cells . 1 . 5 - fold ( a and b ) and threefold ( c and d ) stage embryos were double - stained for UNC - 60B ( a and c ) and body wall muscle – specific myosin heavy chain A ( myoA ) ( b and d ) .

Role of ADF / Cofilin in Myofibril Assembly 499 disorganization of myofibrils ; these mutations resulted in abnormal actin - regulating activities of UNC - 60B ; and UNC - 60B was primarily expressed in body wall muscle cells during embryonic stages . Function of UNC - 60B as a Regulator of Actin Filament Dynamics We detected three major in vitro functions for UNC - 60B as an actin binding protein : F - actin binding activity , partial F - actin depolymerizing activity to maintain a high concen - tration of unassembled actin , and weak F - actin severing activity to accelerate actin polymerization . The combina - tions of biochemical and phenotypic consequences of each unc - 60 mutation as summarized in Table I suggests that UNC - 60B is required to maintain a dynamic state of actin filaments . The most severe phenotype of e677 is probably caused by its low level of UNC - 60B protein rather than its reduced activity . The m35 mutation also caused a severe phenotype , yet UNC - 60B ( m35 ) protein is present at an equivalent level to that of wild type . The severity of m35 is due to its poor activity to enhance actin filament turnover . Although this mutant protein weakly binds to F - actin , it has no significant actin - depolymerizing activity ( the weak - est of the mutants ) and no severing activity , which makes actin filaments poorly dynamic . This explanation also can be applied to s1309 , whereas a weak actin - depolymerizing activity detected in a pelleting assay and a fourfold in - crease in the protein level probably improves its pheno - type in the adult muscle as compared with m35 . The phe - notype of the r398 mutant probably is caused by a lack of actin - severing activity in the mutant UNC - 60B protein that failed to increase the number of barbed ends of actin where polymerization preferentially occurs . Nonetheless , its phenotype in adult muscle is not as severe as e677 and m35 , because the r398 mutant protein has a stronger actin - depolymerizing activity than wild type probably by in - creasing the off rate of actin subunits from the pointed ends as previously demonstrated for other ADF / cofilins ( Carlier et al . , 1997 ; Maciver et al . , 1998 ) . However , this actin - depolymerizing activity is likely to be important in late development ( larvae to adults ) , because the embry - onic myofibrils of r398 were highly disorganized and Figure 8 . Disorganization of embryonic myofibrils in unc - 60 mu - tants . Immunofluorescent localization of actin ( a , c , e , and g ) and UNC - 60B ( b , d , f , and h ) in threefold embryos of wild - type ( a and b ) , unc - 60 ( e677 ) ( c and d ) , unc - 60 ( r398 ) ( e and f ) , and unc - 60 ( s1307 ) ( g and h ) were observed by double staining and the same fields from each image are shown . Actin in wild - type ( a ) is continuous along the arrays of the body wall muscle cells . How - ever , in the unc - 60 mutants ( c , e and g ) , actin is found in discrete thick bundles . The extent of disorganization of myofibrils was in - distinguishable between the most severe ( c , e677 ) and second mildest ( e , r398 ) mutants . The weakest mutant , s1307 ( g ) , showed somewhat larger bundles . Bar , 10 (cid:109) m . Figure 9 . Disorganization of adult myofibrils in unc - 60 mutants . Localizations of myosin ( myoA ) , actin , and UNC - 60B in adult body wall muscle of the unc - 60 mutants were observed by immu - nofluorescence microscopy . Actin and UNC - 60B were observed by double staining and the same fields from each image are shown . Bar , 10 (cid:109) m . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 145 , 1999 500 nearly indistinguishable from those of e677 , suggesting that the severing activity is important during the assembly of myofibrils . In contrast , the s1307 mutation caused higher actin - depolymerizing and severing activities than wild type . Therefore , we can interpret that the phenotype of the s1307 animals are caused by overenhancement of actin turnover , suggesting that the dynamics of actin fila - ments need to be maintained at a finely tuned level in or - der to assemble and maintain an organized actin cytoskel - eton . This idea is supported by a report that microinjection of a high concentration of cofilin into nascent myotubes can disrupt myofibrils and induce formation of rodlike structures containing actin ( Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ) . However , it remains unclear why all the unc - 60 muta - tions cause similar phenotypes in embryonic muscle de - spite showing a variety of effects on the properties of UNC - 60B protein . One possibility is that actin polymer - ization during myofibril assembly must be controlled tightly by UNC - 60B , so that either hypoactive or hyperac - tive UNC - 60B can easily disrupt the process of proper in - tegration of actin into myofibrils . Even though the phe - notypes of unc - 60 mutant embryos appeared similar by immunofluorescence microscopy , the other possibility is that the nature of the aggregates of actin in the mutants might be different . Studies on yeast cofilin mutants that are defective in the actin - depolymerizing activity have shown that these mutations cause slower actin filament turnover in actin patches ( Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , aggregated actin fila - ments in e677 , m35 , and s1309 may be static , but those in r398 and s1307 may still be dynamic . To understand the physiological relevance of our bio - chemical data , it would be informative to know the molar ratio of actin and UNC - 60B in developing muscle cells . However , this is technically difficult to determine because methods to dissect embryonic worm muscle cells and / or culture systems for worm muscle are not available . The molar ratio of ADF / cofilin to actin varies from 0 . 17 to 0 . 64 in embryonic chicken tissues ( Bamburg and Bray , 1987 ) . In 10 – d - old chicken embryonic muscles , the ratio of ADF / cofilin ( the sum of ADF and cofilin ) to actin is 0 . 14 ( Na - gaoka et al . , 1996b ) . Assuming that embryonic muscles of the nematode maintain the similar ratio to chicken mus - cles , our data at an UNC - 60B to actin ratio of 0 . 2 : 1 show that wild - type UNC - 60B is able to accelerate actin poly - merization ( Fig . 3 A ) and partially depolymerize F - actin ( Fig . 4 ) , but unable to significantly sever F - actin ( Fig . 5 ) . Nevertheless , we speculate that severing activity is an im - portant function of UNC - 60B because we observed that the r398 mutation that abolished severing activity but not G - actin binding causes disorganization of myofibrils . This discrepancy is probably explained by the cooperative na - ture of binding between ADF / cofilin and F - actin ( Mc - Gough et al . , 1997 ) . We preliminarily have observed that UNC - 60B binds F - actin cooperatively by electron micros - copy ( McGough , A . , and S . Ono , unpublished data ) . In ad - dition , the sigmoidal curves of F - actin severing activity by wild - type and s1307 mutant UNC - 60B in Fig . 5 suggest that UNC - 60B severs F - actin cooperatively . Therefore , it is possible that severing of a subset of actin filaments in muscle cells is important for actin filament dynamics in vivo . Implications for the Interaction of ADF / Cofilins with Actin Our studies on mutant UNC - 60B provide important in - sights into the structural basis of the interaction of ADF / cofilins with actin . Four missense mutations that we identi - fied occur at amino acid residues that are highly conserved among ADF / cofilin species ( sequence alignments with other ADF / cofilins are shown by McKim et al . , 1994 ) , but none of these residues have been characterized by previ - ous site - directed mutagenesis on ADF / cofilins ( Moriyama et al . , 1992 ; Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Nagaoka et al . , 1996a ; Jiang et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . Although a mutant maize ADF3 , in which both Ala - 104 ( equivalent to Ala - 111 of UNC - 60B that is mutated in s1309 ) and Tyr - 103 are al - tered , it has been shown to reduce its affinity to both G - actin and F - actin ( Jiang et al . , 1997 ) , a role for this ala - nine on its own has not been characterized previously . However , we should consider that the mutations we iden - tified here were selected for their effects on muscle func - tion from a random mutagenesis and were not designed for a systematic mutagenesis , so that these mutations may alter or disrupt the structure of UNC - 60B . It is quite infor - mative that three mutations ( s1309 , s1307 , and m35 ) occur within a putative actin binding helix that has been pro - posed by molecular modeling ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ; Wriggers et al . , 1998 ) and a biochemical study using syn - thetic peptides ( Yonezawa et al . , 1991 ; Van Troys et al . , 1997 ) . Because these mutations changed small side chains ( alanine or serine ) to larger side chains ( valine , phenylala - nine , or leucine ) , they are likely to interfere with the inter - action of the helix with actin , alter the integrity of the he - lix , or disrupt the intramolecular interaction of the helix with some other regions in UNC - 60B . We are interested in the s1307 mutation ( S112F ) that causes hyperactivity . Re - cent structural analysis by electron microscopy suggests that this mutant alters rabbit muscle actin filament by a greater extent than wild type ( McGough et al . , 1997 ; Mc - Gough , A . , and S . Ono , unpublished data ) , which is a likely reason why this mutant causes stronger F - actin sev - ering activity than wild - type . Currently , we are trying to understand this from molecular modeling of the structure of the mutant protein and reconstruction of the actin fila - ments that are decorated by the s1307 mutant . Our result that a small COOH - terminal truncation by the r398 mutation impaired F - actin binding and severing activities provides evidence that the COOH terminus of ADF / cofilin is involved in F - actin binding . This is in agree - ment with the mutational analysis of yeast cofilin that has shown that mutations of charged amino acids in the COOH - terminal (cid:97) – helix - 4 abolished only F - actin binding but not G - actin binding ( Lappalainen et al . , 1997 ) . How - ever , the portion that is truncated in the r398 mutant ap - peared to be closer to the COOH - terminal end than these mutations in yeast cofilin based on sequence alignments ( McKim et al . , 1994 ) . Currently , it is difficult to predict how the COOH - terminal region is involved in F - actin binding , because this region is quite divergent among ADF / cofilin species and a high resolution structure of a complex of actin and ADF / cofilin has not been deter - mined . Also , it is important that the r398 mutation affects both F - actin binding and severing activities . This result Ono et al . Role of ADF / Cofilin in Myofibril Assembly 501 strongly supports the idea that two actin - binding sites are required to change the twist of F - actin resulting in the de - stabilization of actin filaments ( McGough et al . , 1997 ) . Expression and Localization of UNC - 60B in Muscle Cells UNC - 60B was found to be expressed in embryonic body wall muscle cells before obvious myofibrils were formed , suggesting that UNC - 60B is involved in the process of myofibril assembly . Localization of UNC - 60B diffusely in the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 , a and c ) rather than in a structural component suggests its function as a regulator of actin fila - ment dynamics in the cytoplasm . However , we noticed that intensity and location of the immunostaining of UNC - 60B was variable depending on the methods of fixation . Among the methods that we tested , freeze - crack – metha - nol fixation that was used in Fig . 7 gave the brightest and sharpest staining of UNC - 60B and appeared to reflect the real localization of UNC - 60B . Permeabilization of worms by a detergent ( 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ) tended to lose UNC - 60B and result in unclear diffuse staining of UNC - 60B . For example , the staining patterns of UNC - 60B in Fig . 8 showed slightly vague images , in which embryos were fixed with formaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol and 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 to optimize the immu - nostaining of actin . Therefore , although we found localiza - tion of UNC - 60B to adult myofibrils in Fig . 9 , diffusely localized UNC - 60B probably was lost in the course of ex - tensive washing of fixed worms by 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . Ac - tually , when adult worms were fixed and permeabilized by a freeze - crack – methanol method , we observed a diffuse bright staining of UNC - 60B in the cytoplasm , whereas the structures of myofibrils were not preserved well ( data not shown ) . Our observation that UNC - 60B is mainly local - ized in diffuse cytoplasm agrees with reports that ADF / co - filin is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of cultured chicken skeletal muscle cells ( Abe et al . , 1993 ; Ono et al . , 1993 ) . Isoform - specific Function of ADF / Cofilins Our finding that mutations in UNC - 60B specifically cause defects in myofibril assembly provides the first evidence of an isoform - specific requirement of ADF / cofilin for assem - bly of a particular differentiated cytoskeletal structure . This is , in part , explained by the muscle - specific expres - sion of UNC - 60B . In contrast , UNC - 60A was detected in almost all cells in embryos and a wide variety of cells in adult worms including body wall muscle ( data not shown ) . However , more importantly , a functional difference be - tween UNC - 60A and UNC - 60B probably contributes to the specific function of UNC - 60B in muscle cells . We have reported previously that these two isoforms regulate actin filament dynamics in different manners ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) , suggesting that UNC - 60B can enhance actin fila - ment dynamics to an optimal range for proper assembly of myofibrils . This speculation is supported by our results that either hypoactive or hyperactive mutant UNC - 60B can cause defects in myofibril assembly , Mammals have a muscle - specific isoform of cofilin ( M - cofilin ; Ono et al . , 1994 ) . M - cofilin is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle and upregulated upon differenti - ation of cultured myogenic cell lines ( Ono et al . , 1994 ) . Al - though its intracellular localization and function are yet to be characterized , we expect that M - cofilin has functional similarity to UNC - 60B . However , an alignment and a phy - logenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of the ADF / cofi - lin family has shown that UNC - 60B does not exhibit out - standing similarity to M - cofilin ( Lappalainen et al . , 1998 ) . The sequence of UNC - 60B is most related to UNC - 60A and equally similar to three vertebrate ADF / cofilins ( ADF , M - cofilin , and nonmuscle - type cofilin ) . Also , we could not detect any regions commonly unique to UNC - 60B and M - cofilin . Therefore , M - cofilin probably has been evolved specifically for the structure and function of skeletal mus - cle in vertebrates . Nevertheless , because of the conserva - tion of muscle components and architecture in all animals , we believe that there should be a protein , possibly M - cofi - lin , with a function similar to UNC - 60B in mammalian cells .
