However , the complete repertoire of m 6 A - modified RNA interacting RBPs in the synaptic compartment , and whether they are involved in fear extinction , have yet to be revealed . Using RNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry , we discovered 12 novel , synapse - specific , learning - induced m 6 A readers in the medial prefrontal cortex of male C57 / B6 mice . m 6 A RNA - sequencing also revealed a unique population of learning - related m 6 A - modified RNAs at the synapse , which includes a variant of the long non - coding RNA ( lncRNA ) metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ( Malat1 ) . m 6 A - modified Malat1 binds to a subset of novel m 6 A readers , including cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2 ( CYFIP2 ) and dihydropyrimidase - related protein 2 ( DPYSL2 ) and a cell - type - specific , state - dependent , and synapse - specific reduction in m 6 A - modified Malat1 disrupts the interaction between Malat1 and DPYSL2 and impairs fear extinction . The consolidation of fear - extinction memory therefore relies on an interaction between m 6 A - modified Malat1 and select RBPs in the synaptic compartment . Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse Main The extinction of conditioned fear , the reduction in responding to a feared cue , which occurs when the cue is repeatedly presented without any adverse consequence , is an evolutionarily conserved behavioural adaptation that is critical for survival . Like other forms of learning , long - lasting memory for fear extinction depends on coordinated changes in gene expression , particularly in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex ( ILPFC ) [ 1 ] [ 2 , 3 ] . We and others have shown that this process involves a variety of RNA - based mechanisms , including the activity of microRNAs [ 4 ] as well as the localised regulation of transcription by long noncoding RNAs [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] . However , there other regulatory mechanisms that can influence RNA metabolism and the capacity of neurons to adapt in response to learning . In particular , the RNA modification N6 - methyladenosione ( m 6 A ) is dynamic and reversible [ 8 ] and regulates many aspects of state - dependent RNA metabolism in the central nervous system , including RNA stability , localisation , and translation [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] . This epitranscriptomic mark is enriched in the adult brain [ 12 ] , directly involved in the acquisition of fear - related learning and memory [ 13 ] , spatial memory consolidation [ 14 ] [ 15 ] and involved in dopaminergic signalling [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] . In addition , a population of synapse - enriched m 6 A - modified RNA has recently been discovered in the adult prefrontal cortex [ 19 ] ; however , the functional relevance of localised m 6 A - modified RNA and its interacting partners in the context of fear extinction has not been elucidated . Many RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) recognise and interact with m 6 A - modified RNA , and several , including the YTHDF family of proteins , have been shown to be m 6 A readers [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] . Whether there are m 6 A readers in the synaptic compartment that support specific forms of learning and memory , including fear extinction is completely unknown . Given the increasing recognition that m 6 A - modiifed RNAs play important roles in brain function [ 11 ] , we therefore considered their impact on this important learning process . Using RNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry , we discovered 12 novel extinction learning - induced m 6 A readers that are primarily associated with in synaptic remodeling and synaptic vesicle endocytosis . This was accompanied by the detection of a unique population of learning - related m 6 A - modified RNAs at the synapse , including a variant of the long non - coding RNA ( lncRNA ) metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 ( Malat1 ) . In addition , we found that the synapse - enriched m 6 A - modified Malat1 interacts with a subset of novel m 6 A readers , including cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2 ( CYFIP2 ) and dihydropyrimidase - related protein 2 ( DPYSL2 , also known as CRMP2 ) , and that a cell - type - specific , state - dependent , and synapse - specific reduction in m 6 A - modified Malat1 disrupts the interaction between Malat1 and DPYSL2 and impairs fear extinction . The formation of fear - Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse extinction memory therefore relies on direct interaction between m 6 A - modified Malat1 and a select number of novel m 6 A readers in the synaptic compartment . Results Novel synaptic m 6 A readers associated with fear - extinction learning . Previous studies have identified m 6 A - modified RNA binding proteins , including YTHDF2 / 3 , YTHDC1 , ELAVL1 , FMRP and IGF2BP1 [ 27 ] [ 24 ] [ 28 ] with some being expressed at the synapse [ 19 ] . However , no study has determined whether there are learning - specific m 6 A - modified RNA interacting RBPs in the synaptic compartment . Using synthetic biotinylated control and m 6 A - modified oligonucleotides , we set out to determine whether there are synaptic m 6 A readers that might be specific to fear - extinction learning . C57 / BL6 mice were trained using a standard cued fear - conditioning task followed by either novel context exposure ( retention control , RC ) or extinction ( EXT ) training . Immediately after training , the mPFC was extracted and four were pooled for the isolation of synaptosomes followed by m 6 A - modified RNA - immunoprecipitation followed by mass - spectrometry ( m 6 A - RIP - MS ) . In the synaptic fraction derived from RC - trained animals , we identified 76 proteins that interacted with the m 6 A - modified RNA , with many proteins associated with mitochondrial function ( Fig . 1A ) . In comparison , within the synapse - enriched fraction of EXT trained animals , 61 proteins were found to interact with m 6 A - modified RNA ( Fig . 1B ) . These proteins are functionally distinct from those in the RC group , and included proteins involved in synaptic vesicle clustering ( SYN1 , SYN2 ) and budding ( SNAP91 , DNM1 , DNM3 ) , neuron projection morphogenesis ( DPYSL2 , TUBB3 , CRMP1 ) and translation elongation activity ( EEF1A1 , EEF1A2 ) . Overall , we identified 12 synapse - specific m 6 A readers that were unique to EXT ( Table 1 ) . These included proteins associated with the synapse ( CYFIP2 , ADD1 ) , and involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis ( PACSIN1 , SH3GL1 ) and calmodulin binding ( CAMKV , PLBC1 ) .

Given that the pattern of RNA expression can differ based on its cellular localisation and context , we next examined the levels of m 6 A - modified RNA following fear extinction learning . tissue derived from either RC or EXT trained animals was used to isolate RNA from the synaptic compartment and subjected to low - input RNA m 6 A - sequencing . 24 libraries ( input and RNA m 6 A enriched after either RC and EXT ) with 3 biological replicates each ( where each replicate was a pool of four PFCs ) were sequenced . The peak distribution along modified transcripts in the non - synaptic fraction showed an accumulation of m 6 A in the 3’UTR ( Fig . 2A , B and F ) . In contrast , the majority of peaks along transcripts in the synaptic fraction were found in the CDS ( Fig . 2A and C ) . The difference in distribution of m 6 A marks in different compartments suggests the possibility that m 6 A - modified RNA serves a functionally distinct role in the synapse compared to other neuronal compartments . As such , a GO term analysis for significantly modified transcripts revealed that the non - synaptic m 6 A - modified RNA was associated with cellular transmission and nerve impulse transmission whereas the synaptic m 6 A - modified RNA was related to translation ( Fig . 2D ) . In the non - synaptic fraction , a total of 15 716 m 6 A peaks were identified , mapping to 7250 genes , where 506 transcripts were significantly enriched in comparison to input after EXT training ( Fig . 2E ) . Many of the m 6 A modified transcripts including Camk2a and Grin2b [ 9 , 19 ] as well as Shank1 and Homer1 [ 42 ] are known to be functionally related to plasticity and memory . In the synaptic fraction , a total of 2126 m 6 A peaks were identified , which mapped to 1639 genes . Out of these , 64 were significantly enriched in comparison to input after EXT training ( Fig . 2A ) . In addition to several known m 6 A - modified RNAs , including Kif5a , Atp1a2 , and ribosomal subunits Rpl13 , Rpl21 , Rpl23a and Rpl26 , which have been previously identified at synapse under baseline conditions [ 19 ] , we discovered novel , extinction learning - related m 6 A - modified transcripts , including Trim2 , Calr , Man1a2 , Malat1 and Ncam2 . Previously thought to be selectively expressed in nuclear speckles and associated with the alternative splicing of Nlgn1 and SynCam1 [ 43 ] , Malat1 has recently been shown to traffic to the synapse [ 44 ] , suggesting that local activity of Malat1 may contribute to neural growth and synaptogenesis [ 45 ] [ 46 ] . Our finding that m 6 A - modified Malat1 accumulates at the synapse ( Fig . 2G ) in response to extinction learning agrees with this observation and supports the growing appreciation of the multidimensional functional capacity for lncRNAs .

Since m 6 A - modified Malat1 localises to the synapse in response to fear - extinction learning , we next investigated whether there are m 6 A readers that may be specific to m 6 A - modified Malat1 at the synapse . In the RC group , 92 proteins uniquely bound to the Malat1 oligos compared to 100 proteins in the EXT group . The proteins which interact with Malat1 in the RC group are associated with RNA binding ( EIF4A2 , RPS15 , RPS16 ) , nucleotide binding ( CNM1 , SYN3 ) and glycolytic processes ( ALDOA , PDK ) ( Fig . 3A ) . In comparison , EXT dependent Malat1 RBPs were associated with nucleotide binding ( DDX1 , ACTG1 ) as well as neurotransmitter secretion ( STXBP1 , SYN1 , SYN2 ) and translation ( RPS16 , RPS20 , EIF1A2 ) . These data suggest that the proteins which bind to Malat1 at the synapse also differ based on the learning - context . To determine which of the 100 EXT Malat1 proteins are also m 6 A readers , we compared them with the 62 m 6 A proteins identified at the synapse after EXT training . 32 overlapping proteins were found to recognize both m 6 A and Malat1 at the synapse , and were associated with ADP binding ( GLUD , PGK ) , extracellular exosomes ( CYFIP2 , TUBB4A , EEF1A1 ) and protein binding ( DPYSL2 , STXBP1 , SYN1 ) ( Fig . 3C ) . Of particular interest were the m 6 A readers CYFIP2 and DPYSL2 ( also known as CRMP2 ) that show a strong interaction with Malat1 at the synapse . CYFIP2 and DPYSL2 belong to the WAVE complex and serve to influence actin dynamics at the synapse and axonal growth [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] both of which are critical for memory consolidation [ 51 ] . To confirm that the interaction is m 6 A - dependent , using an adaptation of the CIRTS system , Malat1 was site - specifically demethylated in primary neurons by directing the m 6 A demethylase FTO to three m 6 A sites along the Malat1 transcript ( CIRTS - FTO Malat1 ) . Upon KCI stimulation and collection of neurons , fRIP - qPCR was performed using CYFIP2 and DPYSL2 antibodies . Though the level of Malat1 bound to CYFIP2 did not change ( Figure 3D ) , there was a decrease in binding with DPYSL2 following Malat1 demethylation ( Figure 3E ) . Together , these data suggest that the interaction between m 6 A - modified Malat1 and DPYSL2 at the synapse may be important for regulating localized activity - dependent synaptic processes underlying memory formation .

Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse Targeted degradation of m 6 A - Malat1 at the synapse leads to impaired fear - extinction memory . To explore whether m 6 A - modified Malat1 and its protein interactions at the synapse are required for fear - extinction memory , we again used the CIRTS system to trigger the degradation m 6 A - modified Malat1 at the synapse by targeting the m 6 A reader YTHDF2 to m 6 A modified Malat1 at the synapse . The viruses were initially validated in primary cortical neurons ( Fig . 4A ) followed by in vivo tests to determine whether the selective degradation of m 6 A - Malat1 at the synapse influences fear - extinction memory . Knockdown of m 6 A - modified Malat1 prior to EXT training had no effect on within session performance ( Fig . 4G ) . However , when testing for memory , those mice with the control virus who underwent EXT training show significantly decreased freezing scores ( Fig . 4H ) . This same significant decrease in freezing scores is not observed in the EXT trained mice infused with the Malat1 viruses , indicating an impairment in fear - extinction memory consolidation ( Fig . 4H ) . Therefore , these data demonstrate that m 6 A - modified Malat1 is critical for fear - extinction memory , and imply a role for the interaction between m 6 A - modified Malat1 and specific RBPs in this process .

This effect was blocked in animals treated with CIRTS - YTHDF2 virus and extinction trained ( EXT CIRTs Malat1 , n = 8 ) . Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse Discussion In this study , we have discovered that there are extinction - learning - specific m 6 A readers at the synapse . In addition , we found a unique population of synapse - enriched m 6 A - modified RNA that accumulate in response to fear - extinction learning . Fear extinction drives the expression of m 6 A - modified lncRNA Malat1 to the synapse and promotes its interaction with novel m 6 A readers CYFIP and DPYSL2 . Both proteins are critically involved in memory formation via actin polymerization at synapses and axonal growth . Consequently , upon targeted removal of the m 6 A mark on Malat1 and degradation of m 6 A - modified Malat1 at the synapse , RNA - protein interactions can no longer occur and fear extinction memory is impaired , suggesting a direct role for m 6 A - modified Malat1 in the consolidation of fear extinction memory . A significant number of novel m 6 A readers in the synaptic compartment after fear - extinction learning was revealed . These RBPs , which are a combination of indirect and direct m 6 A RBPs , include the endocytosis related protein SNAP91 [ 39 ] , CAMKV and SEPTIN8 which are important for vesicle formation [ 32 ] [ 38 ] , and CYFIP2 , which is necessary for synapse formation [ 36 ] . Interestingly , all these processes are associated with memory consolidation , suggesting m 6 A facilitates the formation of memory through direct effects on proteins involved in various aspects of synaptic plasticity . Many of the m 6 A - modified RNAs detected at the synapse in previous studies , such as Homer1 , Shank1 and Camk2a were not detected at the synapse after EXT learning , but rather in the non - synaptic fraction . This is likely due to the time point at which PFC tissue were collected . Tissue was collected immediately after EXT training ; however , it is possible time after training is required for the localisation of transcripts to the synapse . In agreement with previous data , the majority detected in the non - synaptic fraction contained m 6 A peaks in the 3’UTR [ 52 ] whereas m 6 A peaks were more likely to occur in the CDS of RNAs detected in the synaptic fraction . The variation in the distribution of m 6 A peaks among transcripts suggests the functional role of m 6 A - modified RNA depends on RNA localisation . This is supported by the finding that non - synaptic transcripts were associated with cellular transmission . In contrast , m 6 A - modified synaptic transcripts were associated with translation , which confirms previous observations regarding the presences of m 6 A in the CDS [ 53 ] . The functional relevance of m 6 A is likely dictated through interactions of m 6 A - modified RNA with unique reader proteins in each subcellular compartment . Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse One of the most interesting synapse - enriched m 6 A - modified targets was Malat1 . Initially , Malat1 was discovered in cancer cells but also found to be abundant in neurons . Malat1 , a lncRNA , has previously been demonstrated to be m 6 A - modified [ 54 ] [ 27 ] [ 55 ] [ 12 ] . This m 6 A mark is believed to change the secondary structure of Malat1 such that proteins such as HNRNPG and HNRNPC , which are involved in splicing can bind to the lncRNA [ 56 ] [ 57 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] . Interestingly , Malat1 is enriched in nuclear speckles where it recruits splicing factors to genes such as Ngln1 and SynCam1 . These genes are involved in synapse formation and maintenance thereby enabling an indirect influence of Malat1 on the synaptic density of hippocampal neurons [ 43 ] . Malat1 has also been detected in the synapse , in agreement with our findings [ 44 ] although its functional relevance was not determined . Beyond HNRNPG and HNRNPC as m 6 A readers , we found m 6 A - modified Malat1 interacts with numerous m 6 A reader proteins , at the synapse , in the context of fear - extinction learning . m 6 a - modified Malat1 binds to CYFIP2 and DPYSL2 . CYFIP2 protein expression at the synapse [ 60 ] contributes to actin polymerisation and therefore synaptic plasticity through changes in spine morphology [ 61 ] . In fact , reduced Cyfip2 levels impair spine maturation in CA1 pyramidal neurons and prevents the retention of spatial memory in water maze tasks [ 62 ] . DPYSL2 has also been detected in dendritic spines [ 63 ] and is associated with axonal growth , neurotransmitter release and synaptic physiology [ 64 ] . Crmp2 conditional knock - out mice exhibit impaired hippocampal dependent learning and memory impairments in the Y - maze test , fear - conditioning and Morris water maze test [ 65 ] . Both CYFIP2 and DPYSL2 are associated with the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) . This complex is composed of five components – CYFIP1 and / or CYFIP2 , NAP1 or HEM2 or KETTE , ABI2 , HSPC300 or BRICK1 and WAVE1 or SCAR [ 66 ] . Loss of function of this WRC in vivo or in cultured neurons results in a decrease in mature dendritic spines [ 50 ] . Also , electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices of WAVE1 null mice showed altered synaptic plasticity and mutant WAVE1 mice have impaired hippocampal - dependent spatial memory as evaluated by the Morris water maze test [ 51 ] . In this complex , CYFIP1 is a key regulator of neuronal actin dynamics , by regulating mRNA translation and actin polymerisation [ 61 ] [ 67 ] . In addition , CYFIP proteins also recognise FMRP , which is a known m 6 A reader , involved in the export of modified RNA [ 24 ] . However , DPYSL2 is involved in the kinesin - 1 dependent transport of the WAVE1 complex . Upon DPYSL2 knockdown ( KD ) axonal growth is inhibited and for this DPYSL2 - induced axonal growth to occur , WAVE1 is required [ 68 ] . Furthermore , KD of DPYSL2 and kinesin1 resulted in the delocalisation of the WAVE1 complex from growth cones of axons . Thus , suggesting Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse DPYSL2 mediated localisation of the WAVE1 is critical for axon formation [ 49 ] . As it is known that lncRNAs bind to proteins to promote their localisation [ 69 ] , it is likely the m 6 A mark on Malat1 acts as beacon for the binding of WAVE complex proteins . Once bound , Malat1 may localise these proteins to the same location , to form the complex and ultimately influence synapse formation and maintenance , which is critical for memory consolidation . Therefore , the RNA - MS data suggests that m 6 A modified Malat1 contribute to the consolidation of fear - extinction memory through RBP interactions and protein localisation at the synapse . Finally , upon targeted degradation of m 6 A - Malat1 at the synapse in the context of fear - extinction learning an impairment in fear - extinction memory is observed . Many of the functional m 6 A studies in the brain have relied on the manipulation of m 6 A methyltransferases and demethylases [ 13 ] [ 9 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 70 ] . Very few studies have looked at the effect of manipulating a single RNA at a specific time and place [ 71 ] particularly in the context of fear - extinction learning . Here we used the CIRTS - YTHDF2 single plasmid system with slight [ 72 ] modifications to degrade m 6 A - modified Malat1 at the synapse . The CIRTS - YTHDF2 construct was modified to include a Calm3 intronic region ( 3’UTR ) which can localise the construct to the synapse . As the guide ( either control or Malat1 ) is expressed everywhere , only the construct is localised to the synapse , so once the CIRTS - YTHDF2 is at the synapse it can recognise Malat1 to have its degradative effects . Indeed , binding of YTHDF2 to m 6 A modified RNA has been shown to result in the localisation of RNA from the translatable pool to decay sites ( i . e . processing bodies ) . The carboxy - terminal of YTHDF2 determines selective binding to m 6 A - modified RNA and the amino - terminal domain allows localisation of the entire YTHDF2 - RNA complex [ 73 ] . As such , the degradation of m 6 A - Malat1 at the synapse resulted in the impairment of fear - extinction memory . The impairment in fear - extinction memory is likely through the lack of m 6 A - Malat1 interactions occurring between CYFIP2 and DPYSL2 proteins , thus inhibiting localisation of the proteins to form WAVE complexes and ultimately reducing synapse formation . In summary , we have the discovered that m 6 A - modified Malat1 at the synapse is critical for fear - extinction memory , a finding that deepens our understanding of the mechanistic role of m 6 A - modified RNA and its interaction with specific RBPs in subcellular time and space . Together these data support the idea that the state dependent activity of m 6 A - modified RNA is critically important for the consolidation of fear extinction memory .

All authors discussed results and revised the manuscript . Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse Materials and Methods Animals Adult , male C58BL / 6 mice ( at 9 - 10 weeks old , 20 - 25g in weight ) were used for experiments . Mice were housed 4 animals per cage on a 12 - hour light : dark cycle ( lights on 0700h ) in a humidity and temperature - controlled vivarium , with rodent chow and water given ad libitum . All animal behavioural testing was conducted during the light phase in red - light illuminated testing rooms . Mice were culled by cervical dislocation , the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) was dissected from whole brains snap frozen on liquid nitrogen and transferred to - 80 storage . All procedures were conducted according to protocols and guidelines approved by the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee . Synaptosome isolations Synaptosomes were isolated from PFCs of 60CS 12 RC and 12 extinction trained adult mice ( 10 weeks of age ) , using a discontinuous Percoll - sucrose density gradient with modifications . 4 PFCs were dissected and homogenised in ice - cold GM buffer ( 2 . 5M sucrose , 1M Tris - HCI ) for one synaptosome isolation , leaving 3 RC and 3 EXT samples . A 250uL aliquot of this total cell homogenate was taken and the rest of the homogenate centrifuged at 1 , 000g for 10 minutes at 4C . After centrifuging , the supernatant was applied to a discontinuous Percoll gradient , comprising of 3 % , 10 % , 15 % and 23 % Percoll layers ( GE Healthcare ) in GM buffer and RNaseOUT ( 1 : 1000 ) . The gradient was centrifuged at 18400 rpm for 5 minutes at 4C in a fixed - angle rotor . Four major fractions were separated from the Percoll gradient , where synaptosomes were collected from layers 3 and 4 . These layers were pooled for each sample and diluted fourfold with cold GM - buffer and pelleted by centrifuging 14 , 800 rpm for 30 minutes at 4C . Pellet was transferred to a new tube and stored at - 80C until ready for use . RNA - immunoprecipitation and mass - spectrometry Two previously published biotin - labelled RNA oligonucleotides were used in this assay ( Dominissini 2012 ) . Streptavidin - conjugated agarose beads were pre - blocked using 1 % BSA for 30 minutes at 4C . After 30 minutes , BSA was discarded and beads were resuspended in 1X RNA capture buffer ( 20mM Tris , pH7 . 5 , 1M NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 1ul RNAse OUT ) and 2ug of oligos were added per reaction . Beads and oligos were incubated for 2 hours at 4C . After incubation , beads were washed 3 times with 20mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 5 - 10 minutes per wash . After washing , 1X protein - RNA binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , 100U / mL RNAseOUT , 1M DTT , 1X PIC ) was added to the beads and incubated at 4C until lysates are ready to add to the beads . Nuclear and synaptosome lysates from trained mouse PFC tissue were washed with 1X PBS ( 8000rpm , 2 minutes , 4C ) . Lysates were Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse resuspended in RNA immunoprecipitation buffer ( 150mM KCI , 25mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 5mM EDTA , 0 . 5mM DTT , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 100U / mL RNAseOUT , 1M DTT , 1X PIC ) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes . After 30 minutes , lysates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 10 000g ( 4C ) . Keep the supernatant and add protein - RNA binding buffer and 30uL of 50 % glycerol to each lysate . Now the lysates are ready to add to pre - bound beads and oligos . Nuclear or synaptic tissue lysates were incubated with beads for 2 hours at 4C then UV crosslinked for 2 minutes at 120 , 000kJ . After crosslinking , beads were washed 2 - 3 times with wash buffer ( 20mM Tris , pH7 . 5 , 10mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , RNAseOUT , 1M DTT , 1X PIC ) for 5 minutes per wash . After the last wash , the beads were sent for LC - MS / MS at the Institute of Molecular Biosciences Mass Spectrometry Unit . Three replicates were conducted for each group ( RC - control , RC - m 6 A , EXT - control and EXT - m 6 A ) . This same method was used for the Malat1 protein pull down assay but this time using probes against Malat1 . Each group was manually sorted for high confidence proteins ( i . e . > 2 hits of the same protein in each replicate and the same protein had to be detected in two or more replicates to be included in further analysis ) . All proteins were analysed by STRING to determine functional protein association networks and clusters . Low - input m 6 A - sequencing m 6 A - immunoprecipitation was performed as previously published by Dominissini et al . , ( 2012 ) , with slight modifications . Up to 100ng of non - synaptic and synaptic RNA was used . RNA was chemically fragmented into approximately 100 nucleotide fragments by 5 - minute incubation at 94C in fragmentation buffer ( 10mM ZnCl2 , 10mM Tris - HCI pH 7 ) . The fragmentation was stopped with 0 . 05M EDTA . Input samples were stored at - 80C . m 6 A - enrichment samples were incubated overnight at 4C with 5ug of affinity purified anti - m 6 A polyclonal antibody ( Abcam ) in IPP buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 10mM Tris - HCI pH 7 . 4 ) . The mixture was then immunoprecipitated by incubation with protein - G beads at 4C for 2 hours . After extensive washing , bound RNA was eluted from beads in 10uL of water . For m 6 A - enrichment of RNA for qRT - PCR , there were four groups of RNA - input , m6A enriched , unbound RNA or IgG control . RNA was not fragmented . An overnight incubation was also conducted with either the anti - m 6 A antibody or IgG control and the supernatant or “unbound” RNA fraction ( i . e . the RNA which did not bind to the m 6 A antibody conjugated beads ) was also saved . All samples were washed and eluted in 12uL of water and used for cDNA synthesis . 8uL of RNA was used for library generation with the SMARTer Stranded Pico Input Mammalian Takara kit , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Each library was subjected to AMPure XP ( Beckman Coulter ) purification to remove primer - dimers and fragments larger than 500bp . The final libraries ( size distribution from 200 - 500bp , with the Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse peak at approximately 400bp ) , were run on a single - flow cell on Hiseq 4000 ( Illumina ) for paired - end sequencing . m 6 A - sequencing data analysis Cutadapt was used to trim off low - quality nucleotides ( Phred quality < 20 ) and adaptor sequences at the 3’ end . All reads were then aligned to further filter reads mapped to rRNA or Phi X genomes . HiSAT ( v2 . 1 . 0 ) was used to align the filtered reads to the mouse genome ( mm10 ) . Once aligned , significantly modified transcripts in RC vs . EXT groups were determined using ExomePeak ( v2 . 16 . 0 ) . All bioinformatic analysis was performed by Dr . Qiongyi Zhao . These transcripts were used in Gene Ontology functional analysis using the DAVID Bioinformatic Resources . Also , the Integrative Genomics Viewer software was used to view m 6 A peaks in each sample . Neuronal culture Cortical neurons from embryonic day 16 ( E16 ) mice were prepared and maintained in neurobasal medium containing 2 % B28 , 2mM Glutamax , 50U / mL penicillin and 50ug / mL streptomycin . Neurons were transduced with lentivirus at 3 days in vitro and harvested for experiments 10 days in vitro , after a 4hr , 20mM KCI stimulation . fRIP Formaldehyde RNA immunoprecipitation was performed with modified protocols from [ 75 ] and Rinn et al . , ( 2018 ) . Samples were homogenised in PBS and cross - linked using 0 . 1 % formaldehyde ( methanol free ) for 5 minutes at room temperature . Cross - linking was quenched using 125mM glycine . Samples were centrifuged at 8000rpm for 2 minutes and then washed extensively using PBS and 1X protease inhibitor . Samples were resuspended in 1mL lysis buffer ( 25mM Tris - HCI pH7 . 5 , 150mM KCI , 5mM EDTA and 0 . 5 % NP - 40 with 1 : 1000 RNaseOUT , 1M DTT and 1X PIC fresh ) . 56uL of each sample was reserved as the input material ( i . e . does not undergo immunoprecipitation ) and the rest was split in half ( one half undergoes IP with DPYSL2 antibodies and the other half with CYFIP2 antibodies ) . 5ug of antibody was added to each IP and rotated at 4C for 2 hours . After the 2 - hour incubation , 50uL of Protein G beads were added to the antibody - lysate mix and rotated for 1 hour at 4C to isolate protein bound RNA from the beads . Beads were washed with native lysis buffer and resuspended in 56uL of ultrapure water , which was reverse - crosslinked . 33uL of reverse - crosslinking buffer ( 3X PBS , 6 % N - Lauroyl Sarcosine , 30mM EDTA , 15mM DTT , 1 : 1000 RNaseOUT and 1X PIC ) was added to all samples and incubated at 42C for 1 hour then 55C for another hour to separate cross - linked RNA and protein . RNA was extracted using RNAClean XP beads and DNAse treated ( using the Zymo DNase enzyme and buffer as per Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse manufacturer’s protocols ) . RNA was eluted in 11uL of RNAse - free water and used for qRT - PCR . RNA extraction For all RNA samples ( from neuronal cultures and PFC tissue ) RNA was first extracted using Nucleozol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , as per manufacturer’s protocol . At the phase separation step , where the nuclei and protein are pelleted , the supernatant was combined with an equal volume of 95 - 100 % ethanol and transferred to a RCC5 column part of the RNA Clean and Concentrator kit from Zymo Research and manufacturer’s instructions were followed . qRT - PCR Up to 1ug RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the Quantitect Reverse transcription Kit ( Qiagen ) . qPCR was performed on a RotorGeneQ ( Qiagen ) using SYBR - Green Master Mix ( Qiagen ) , with primers for target genes ( Malat1 ) on a RotorGeneQ ( Qiagen ) real - time PCR cycler . All transcript levels were normalised to input RNA using the % input method and each PCR reaction was run in duplicate for each sample . Cloning The CRISPR - Cas - Inspired RNA targeting system ( CIRTs ) was used to demethylate or degrade modified RNA , because it is a single construct of which the protein component is much smaller than earlier iterations of CRISPR - Cas ( Rauch 2019 ) . The pFsy ( 1 . 1 ) GW lentiviral expression vector ( addgene # 27232 ) , containing the synapsin 1 promoter , was used to make the Syn1 - Cirts - Calm3 construct . Upon synaptic activity , it has been demonstrated that STAUFEN binds to the 3’UTR of Calm3 to mediate localisation of Calm3 to dendrites [ 76 ] . Therefore , after transcription of the components and neuronal activation , the addition of the Calm3 3’UTR allows the entire construct to be localised to the synapse . As the guide is expressed everywhere , upon localisation of the construct to the synapse , the construct can be used to degrade / demethylate m 6 A - Malat1 at the synapse . The CIRTs pin nuclease construct , containing a C - terminal Flag tag and nuclear export signal ( NES ) , was a kind gift from Bryan Dickinson group ( Rauch et . al . 2019 ) . The CIRTs cassette was PCR amplified and cloned into AgeI and XbaI site . A NheI site was generated upstream of XbaI using PCR primer . The Calm3 dendritic localization sequence was PCR amplified from psiCheck2 - Calm3 ( a kind gift from Michael Kiebler’s lab ) , and cloned into the NheI and XbaI site . Finally , the U6 - gRNA scaffold was PCR amplified from CIRTS pin nuclease construct and inserted in the XbaI site to make the final construct . For the CIRTs YTHDF2 Calm3 plasmid , the above Syn1 - CIRTs - Calm3 construct was digested using AgeI and NheI . The original CIRTs - 6 : B - defensin 3 - TBP6 . 7 - YTHDF2 plasmid Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse ( # 132544 ) was purchased from Addgene and the YTHDF2 domain was PCR amplified and cloned into the AgeI and NheI sites . The CIRTs FTO plasmid was constructed similarly , using the full - length FTO sequence synthesised by IDT . GFP was PCR amplified and cloned into AgeI site along with a 2A peptide signal . Finally , to clone the gRNAs into the plasmids , DNA fragments were synthesised by IDT . Three gRNAs against Malat1 ( corresponding to m 6 A peaks identified in Fig . 2 ) or a control guide were cloned into the constructs to generate three individual Malat1 targeting constructs and one control construct . Each guide had the U6 promoter ( with the XbaI site ) , followed by TBP fold ( RNA hairpin binding domain ) , guide sequence and overhang with a EcoRI site . Guides were PCR amplified and cloned into the plasmid using XbaI and EcoRI sites . Lentiviral Surgery Lentivirus was prepared as previously described ( Li et al . , 2014 ) . Double cannulae ( PlasticsOne ) were implanted in the anterior posterior plane , along the midline into the infralimbic prefrontal cortex ( ILPFC ) , a minimum of 7 days prior to viral infusions . Injection coordinates were centred at + 1 . 85mm in the anterior posterior ( AP ) plane and - 2 . 5mm in the dorsal - ventral ( DV ) plane . A total of 2uL of lentivirus was introduced via two injections , delivered at a rate of 0 . 1uL / min , 48 hours apart . 24 - hours prior to lentiviral infusions animals were fear conditioned . One - week after lentiviral infusions mice were extinction trained . Behavioural tests Two contexts ( A and B ) were used for all behavioural fear testing . Both conditioning chambers ( Coulbourn Instruments ) had two transparent walls and two stainless steel walls with a steel grid floors ( 3 . 2mm in diameter , 8mm centres ) ; however , the grid floors in context B were covered by flat white plastic transparent surface . This surface is used to minimise context generalisation . Digital cameras were mounted in the ceiling of each chamber and connected via a quad processor for automated scoring in a freezing measurement program ( FreezeFrame ) . Fear conditioning ( context A ) was performed with a spray of lemon - alcohol ( 5 % lemon and 10 % alcohol ) . The fear - conditioning protocol started with a 120 sec pre - fear conditioning incubation which was followed by three pairings of a 120 sec , 80dB white noise conditioned stimulus ( CS ) with a 1 sec , 0 . 7mA foot shock ( US ) . Based on fear conditioned freezing percentages mice were matched into equivalent treatment groups ( Malat1 virus or control virus ) . For extinction ( context B ) which was performed with a spray of vinegar , mice were again allowed to acclimate for 2 minutes and then extinction training involved 60 non - reinforced 120sec CS presentations ( a 60CS training protocol ) . For the behaviour control experiments , animals did not receive the CS ( this group is known as the retention control - RC ) . Memory was tested by returning animals to context B ( 24 hours apart ) with a 3CS - only Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse presentation protocol . In these tests , the CS was presented but no foot shock ( US ) was delivered . Memory was calculated as the percentage of time spent freezing during the tests . For tissue collection for synaptosome isolations , 24 mice were fear - conditioned then 12 were taken as RC and 12 were 60CS extinction trained , 24 hours later . Immediately after extinction training , mice were sacrificed and PFC tissue was snap frozen for synaptosome isolations . Each replicate had non - synaptic and / or synaptic fraction for subsequent experiments . Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 . Two - tailed unpaired Student’s t - test was used comparison between - KCI and + KCI groups in m 6 A enriched , unbound and IgG control fractions as well as CIRTs Control and Malat1 groups . One - way or two - way ANOVA was chosen for multiple comsparisons where appropriate . All post - hoc analysis was performed using Dunnet’s multiple comparison test . Error bars represent SEM where significance was taken as p < 0 . 05 . Novel m 6 A readers at the synapse References 1 . Martin , S . J . et al .
