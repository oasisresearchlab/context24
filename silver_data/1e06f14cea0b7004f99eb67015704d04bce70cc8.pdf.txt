Rao 3 Abstract Introduction : In response to the ongoing COVID - 19 pandemic , countries have adopted various degrees of restric - tive measures on people to reduce COVID - 19 transmission . These measures have had significant social and economic costs . In the absence of therapeutics , and low vaccination coverage , strategies for a safe exit plan from a lockdown are required to mitigate the transmission and simultaneously re - open societies . Most countries have outlined or have implemented lockdown exit plans . The objective of this scoping review is to ( a ) identify and map the different strate - gies for exit from lockdowns , ( b ) document the effects of these exit strategies , and ( c ) discuss features of successful exit strategies based on the evidence . Methods : A five - step approach was used in this scoping review : ( a ) identifying the research question and inclusion / exclusion criteria ; ( b ) searching the literature using keywords within PubMed and WHO databases ; ( c ) study selection ; ( d ) data extraction ; ( e ) collating results and qualitative synthesis of findings . Results : Of the 406 unique studies found , 107 were kept for full - text review . Studies suggest the post - peak period as optimal timing for an exit , supplemented by other triggers such as sufficient health system capacity , and increased testing rate . A controlled and step - wise exit plan which is flexible and guided by information from surveillance sys - tems is optimal . Studies recommend continued use of non - pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing , use of facemasks , and hygiene measures , in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown , even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained . Conclusion : Reviewed studies have suggested adopting a multi - pronged strategy consisting of different approaches depending on the context . Among the different exit strategies reviewed ( phase - wise exit , hard exit , and constant cyclic patterns of lockdown ) , phase - wise exit appears to be the optimal exit strategy .

Background The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) caused by the severe acute respiratory syn - drome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has been responsi - ble for infecting 362 million people . Around 5 . 6 million people have lost their lives [ 1 ] . To mitigate the effects of this pandemic , most countries have implemented various degrees of population movement restrictions . This has involved closing borders , closing non - essential workplaces and schools , restrictions on gatherings and movements of people ( road , air , sea ) . Some of the miti - gation strategies ranged from complete lockdown as seen in India [ 2 ] to moderate strategies like in the United Kingdom supported by increased testing , tracing , and quarantining [ 3 ] . Other mitigation measures included age - selective distancing . For instance , in New Zealand and South Africa , the older population and those with co - morbidities were recommended to be isolated at Open Access * Correspondence : mmisra2 @ jhu . edu 1 Johns Hopkins India Private Ltd , Flat 57 , India International Centre , 40 , Max Muller Marg , New Delhi 110003 , India Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 16 Misra et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 home , while the younger population were allowed to go to work [ 4 ] . These restrictive measures have significant social and economic consequences , especially in low income , and low - and middle - income countries ( LMIC ) . These meas - ures adversely affected the disadvantaged population as it led to the shutdown of economic activities , loss of employment , disruption in education , challenges in access to essential health services and other public ser - vices , including food insecurity [ 5 ] . There is , therefore , a need to exit from lockdowns while simultaneously mitigating the COVID - 19 transmission . In the absence of therapeutics and a significant vaccination coverage , a situation that is commonly seen in many LMICs , there is a need for strategies for a safe exit from the restriction measures . To circumvent the challenges faced following the lockdowns , countries have attempted to devise optimal strategies to exit from lockdowns . Many countries have defined graded exit plans with each phase informed by triggers such as case numbers , infection rate , health sys - tem capacity , etc . Other countries have relied on sero - prevalence studies and increased testing prior to opening up . The phase - wise exit plans are usually structured by type of business , school , and size of gatherings , etc . The timing and containment measures during exit also varied . Almost all exit strategies studied suggest the continued use of non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs - These include physical distancing , use of face mask , and hygiene measures , and other restrictive measures such as stay at home , school closures , travel restrictions , border closures , and steps to address ventilation measures espe - cially in closed spaces ) in various combinations suited to country contexts . Countries such as New Zealand and South Korea began relaxing restrictions only after the number of new daily cases reached almost zero . Austria began implementing its exit plan when the daily caseload fell below 100 , so the health system wasn’t overwhelmed [ 4 ] . However , many countries have opted to open up when transmission rates were falling , but had significant daily case numbers . Therefore , measures for containing the spread of disease need to be in place while opening , to avoid the health system from being overwhelmed by another wave . The objective of this scoping review is to systematically document the evidence regarding exit strategies related to COVID - 19 lockdowns . This scoping review has the following specific aims : ( a ) to identify and map the dif - ferent strategies that have been adopted by countries , and are suggested from modelled scenarios of exit from COVID - 19 related lockdowns , ( b ) document the effects of these exit strategies , and ( c ) discuss features of suc - cessful exit strategies based on the available evidence . Countries are at different stages of the COVID - 19 pan - demic . While increasing vaccination coverage is a global goal , many countries have not been able to achieve this due to constraints related to vaccine availability and affordability . With new variants emerging such as Omi - cron in November 2021 , some countries responded with a knee - jerk reaction of imposing travel bans and strict lockdowns [ 6 , 7 ] . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has criticized travel bans , as they affect lives and livelihoods more than the spread of virus [ 8 ] . Planning how best to exit from lockdowns is an important policy and public health decision . Depending on the local health system capacity , ongoing calibration of restriction meas - ures is required . There is limited evidence so far on the effects of different exit strategies and findings from this scoping review can guide countries in identifying optimal exit strategies . Methods Search strategy and selection criteria This scoping review was based on searches conducted on the PubMed ( https : / / pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov ) and WHO ( https : / / www . who . int ) databases in the interest of time ( Electronic search strategy for PubMed data - base provided as Additional file 1 ) . The inclusion cri - teria for the search included studies from all countries and the time frame was the start of the pandemic in Table 1 Inclusion and Exclusion criteria ( PICOS framework ) Criteria Inclusion Exclusion Population All countries None Intervention Effectiveness of exit strategies on COVID - 19 outcome , effective - ness of vaccination in relation to opening up / lockdown strate - gies All clinical , hospital - based studies , drug trials , effectiveness of strate - gies on non - COVID 19 outcomes , vaccine effectiveness Comparator None None Outcome COVID - 19 incidence / prevalence , transmission factor Non - COVID 19 outcomes Study design Observational studies , modelling studies , reviews Randomized controlled trials , opinion editorials , commentaries , and letters to the editor Page 3 of 16 Misra et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 2020 till May 2021 ( refer to Table 1 on PICOS frame - work ) . The most recent electronic database search was conducted on 7th June 2021 . Full - length , peer - reviewed and pre - print literature available in the English language related to exiting from a lockdown / opening from a lockdown / removal of lockdowns was included . All clinical studies including drug trials , hos - pital - based studies , and vaccine efficacy studies were excluded . Data synthesis After removing the duplicates , two reviewers ( MM and HJ ) independently examined the abstracts and selected 197 articles for full - text review . Ninety articles were removed as they did not match inclusion criteria as per PICOS and 107 articles were retained for the review . The exclusions after full - text review were discussed among the two reviewers . Data from the included arti - cles were extracted in an excel sheet under pre - pop - ulated themes on the timing of exit , determinants for exit , process of exit , components of exit strategy , and effects of opening up . Qualitative synthesis of findings was undertaken and reviewed by all four authors ( MM , HJ , RS and KR ) . Results Search outcomes The search yielded 555 articles using keywords such as Covid , non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) , exiting from lockdown , and exit strategies . We found 406 unique studies combining both databases and after reviewing the abstracts and full - text review , retained 107 studies as a part of this review ( refer to Fig . 1 on study selection flow chart ) . Description of the included studies Of the 107 studies , 98 ( 91 . 5 % ) were original research studies , seven ( 6 . 5 % ) were reviews and two ( 2 % ) were policy papers . Of the 98 original research studies , 82 studies ( 84 % ) were based on mathematical modelling , and 16 ( 16 % ) were observational studies ( refer to Fig . 2 on types of studies found ) . Fig . 1 Study selection flow chart Page 4 of 16 Misra et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 The majority of the studies ( 68 % ) were from high - income countries ( as per the World Bank classification of countries by income , accessed from https : / / datah elpde sk . world bank . org / knowl edgeb ase / artic les / 906519 - world - bank - count ry - and - lendi ng - groups ) , about 18 % of studies were based in middle - income countries and only two stud - ies were based in low - income countries . The review found eleven studies ( 11 % ) that had used global databases . Types of exit strategies and their effects Based on the review , we have identified the following key themes to describe an exit strategy ( refer to Table 2 ) . 1 . Timing of exit - Here the focus is on pre - requisites for opening up after lockdown and determinants for deciding the timing of exit . 2 . Process of exit - This section covers strategies adopted to exit from lockdown and the effect they have had on COVID - 19 outcomes . 3 . Supporting conditions for exit strategies - This section reports on the types of public health measures for con - tainment , and use of NPIs during exit from lockdown . 1 . Timing of the exit Post peak period‑ reducing number of cases and better health system capacity Two review articles based on global data [ 9 , 10 ] observe that most countries have opted for opening during the ‘post - peak period’ . In this period , a plateauing of cases and hospital admissions are main - tained for 2 weeks , implying that the health system can cater to the cases without a crisis . However , this approach risks the formation of new clusters , triggering the next wave of the pandemic , as most of the population is likely not exposed yet to the virus . A strong surveillance system to classify the epidemiological situation is required dur - ing the post - peak period . Petersen et al . [ 10 ] have adopted the WHO guideline to classify new cases in the post - peak period as imported ( from other countries ) , part of a known cluster , or those with an unknown source . An article [ 9 ] has highlighted that governments need to take into account individual healthcare , economic and social considerations while deciding on the timing of open - ing , emphasizing that context is important .

BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 [ 4 ] has summarized various triggers to determine the tim - ing for exiting from lockdowns such as ( a ) health system capacity ( number of beds , equipment available ) , ( b ) health system demand ( e . g . ICU admissions ) , ( c ) death rate ( e . g . New York’s plan to ease restrictions after 14 days continu - ous fall in death rate ) , ( d ) mode of transmission ( New Zea - land’s plan explicitly relates easing levels with change in the mode of transmission - to households only ) , and ( e ) cost - benefit analysis . Cuschieri [ 11 ] has described Malta’s expe - rience of reopening from the COVID - 19 lockdown where the government considered gradual relaxation of lockdown when the ‘Reproduction number’ ( R - The effective repro - ductive number is the average number of secondary cases per infectious case in a population made up of both sus - ceptible and non - susceptible hosts . If R > 1 , the number of cases will increase , such as at the start of an epidemic , and where R < 1 there will be a decline in the number of cases [ 12 ] ) ’ went below one . Raje et al . [ 13 ] have found crosso - ver time point ( when the case recovery rate is greater than case active rate ) as an effective trigger to initiate relaxation of restrictions , based on country experiences . Importance of an evidence - based approach for the timing of exit , which takes into account prevalence and spread of the disease has been advocated in several studies [ 14 , 15 ] . Findings from modelling studies are corroborated by empirical studies ( refer to Table 3 ) . These stud - ies demonstrate the postponing of restrictions , far - ther beyond the peak may have additional benefits in reducing the number of cases . A US based [ 16 ] and an India - based [ 17 ] modelling study shows benefits of prolonged removal of restrictions possibly due to progressive exhaustion of the infectious pool in the population . Findings from an Italy - based modelling study [ 18 ] sug - gest that the stricter the period of lockdown , the longer it might take to exit from the lockdown . In this scenario of a strict lockdown , the subsequent wave is anticipated to be stronger as well . Similarly , if the lockdown is lifted before reaching the peak of the COVID - 19 cases , the next wave of cases will have a sharper peak .

[ 18 ] Peak in number of COVID - 19 cases , Strength of lock - down , Geography • Premature exit before the peak can result in the next wave with a higher peak . • Increasing the strength of the lockdown can delay the time for opening • Epidemic dynamics vary between regions and are independent of each other , therefore , lockdown lifting time is to be evaluated regionally . 4 Global Roy [ 19 ] Peak in number of COVID - 19 cases and health system capacity • Premature exit following a brief reduction in cases can result in quicker , sharper , and higher secondary peak • Continuing lockdown till the peak reduces to health system capacity level can lead to a secondary peak which is above the health system capacity • Reopening after the cases have plateaued , and are well below the health system capacity will lead to a much lower secondary peak . 5 UK Nekovee [ 20 ] Peak in number of COVID - 19 cases Premature lifting of mobility restrictions can result in the return of COVID - 19’s exponential growth 6 Italy Li et al . [ 21 ] True number of infected cases and relative testing capacity Local testing capacity should be more than 16 times the estimated true number of newly infected cases for opening - up 7 UK Moore et al . [ 22 ] Vaccine efficacy , vaccine uptake • Early relaxation of NPIs before sufficient immunity has been achieved can lead to a larger wave of infection • If all restrictions are removed only after the entire adult population has been offered two doses ( assuming vac - cine provides 85 % protection against infection ) , there will still be a next infection wave . ( Except , when vaccine uptake is 95 , 90 , and 85 % in those aged 80 years and older , 50 – 79 years , and 18 – 49 years , respectively ) Page 6 of 16 Misra et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 in different contexts [ 18 – 20 ] have modelled scenarios of premature exit and demonstrated the risk of sharper and rapid infection peaks . Another modelling study from Italy [ 21 ] hypothesized that the true number of infected cases and relative test - ing capacity are better determinants to guide lockdown exit strategies . It concludes that decisions on open - ing should be taken at the local / regional level based on capacity to identify new cases and social contacts . Based on a modelling exercise on data from different regions of Italy , local testing capacity was suggested to be more than 16 times the estimated true number of newly infected cases if a decision to re - open is to be taken . Sufficient health system capacity to cater to sta - ble daily cases was emphasized as a determining factor for opening up [ 23 ] . Vaccination coverage / immunity Vaccines to protect from COVID - 19 are now an important part of the exit strategy . Moore et al . [ 22 ] estimate the effects of vac - cination coverage and lifting of restrictions in the UK - based modelling study . The study finds future waves of infection and deaths can be reduced by increasing lev - els of vaccine - derived immunity in the population . Early relaxation of NPIs before sufficient immunity has been achieved can lead to a larger wave of infection . Further - more , the study adds vaccination alone cannot bring R below one , and control the epidemic . As per the mod - elling exercises , with assumptions of vaccine offering 85 % protection against the infection and vaccine uptake above 75 % , R would reduce to 1 . 58 , which is still greater than the required value of below one . Therefore , NPIs such as face masks , physical distancing , and hygiene measures are required , even after the adult population is fully vaccinated and a stricter lockdown has been lifted . 2 . Process of exit Thirty - six studies in the review examined different pro - cesses of exit - a ) phase - wise / progressive / gradual , b ) hard exit ( resuming all activities at one time ) , c ) cyclic exit ( short cycles of opening and closing ) and , d ) zonal lock - downs ( containment in clusters ) . The majority of studies have identified phase - wise exit as the most appropriate strategy ( refer to Table 4 ) . Six studies [ 24 – 29 ] included comparisons of different exit strategies . Out of these , four studies [ 24 , 26 , 28 , 29 ] compared hard exit with gradual exit and concluded gradual exit to be effective . One study [ 25 ] compared zonal strategy with cyclic strategy and concluded zonal strategy to be effective in LMIC settings . The sixth study [ 27 ] was inconclusive about the findings . Findings related to the process of exit from the select studies have been listed in Table 5 . Phase‑wise Studies done in Belgium [ 30 , 31 , 38 ] , Ger - many [ 32 ] , US [ 33 ] , Netherlands [ 39 ] , Spain [ 40 ] , and India [ 34 , 35 ] show evidence for a phase - wise opening . A study from Germany [ 41 ] suggests phase - wise opening should be reversible ( i . e . , if the reproduction number - R starts going up , the lockdowns can be easily re - imposed ) and be pilot tested for four - eight weeks before complete opening up of all restrictions . Cyclic / rolling lockdown • To get to an optimal exit strategy , a study from Ger - many [ 37 ] suggests repetitive or rolling lockdowns for up to two - three years by which time herd immunity is reached as this would keep the R under one . This study suggests policymakers must weigh the extent of restrictions against the economic con - sequences . The conflict between health protection and economic interests needs reconciliation while opening from the lockdown . • Another modelling study from France [ 36 ] proposes a cyclic or a zig - zag schedule of four - day work and 10 - day lockdown which can prevent a resurgence and also provide part - time employment . This strat - egy suggests a drastic , cautionary , or a relaxed approach to lockdowns that must be supported by strict implementation of NPIs ( hand hygiene , face mask use , physical distancing , and testing , contact tracing , and quarantine ) . • These studies suggest considering economic and social costs before implementing a cyclic or roll - ing lockdown which has logistic challenges . They caution that periodic lockdown and openings do not lead to herd immunity . Transitioning from one phase to the next is made after measuring the impact of deconfinement by estimating the daily R . Table 4 Summary of studies examining processes of exit Sr . No .

N o n e g i v e n Page 9 of 16 Misra et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 Zonal lockdown [ 25 ] • Zonal lockdowns are local lockdowns where specific ‘hotspots’ have a sudden outbreak cluster ( high num - ber of cases ) which have been identified in real - time . Such clustered social distancing works by dividing the population into “zones” according to the geospa - tial distribution . The disease clusters are contained within these zones so that interactions within a zone are significantly greater than interactions between them . An India - based study [ 42 ] suggests that con - tainment zones with a higher case - load should remain even during the exit phase . • Although effective in developed countries , a study based in LMICs [ 25 ] suggests zonal lockdowns with the relaxation of restrictions in remaining places has challenges in LMIC , due to the absence of large - scale population surveillance system and limited testing facilities . A modelling study [ 28 ] compared the effectiveness of different types of exit strategies - hard exit , progressive exit , and cyclic exit ( 2 weeks of lockdown and 2 weeks of opening over four cycles ) and maintaining status quo . Evolution of the Rt ( effective reproduction number at a particular time is the expected number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in a population where some individuals may no longer be susceptible [ 12 ] ) val - ues for the four exit strategies modelled for Luxembourg , Italy , and Japan found that progressive exit offered better outcomes in terms of little impact on the economy and reduced number of cases . A Singapore - based study [ 43 ] concludes the effectiveness of gradual relaxation in flat - tening the curve compared to a sudden resumption of social interactions . 3 . Supporting conditions for exit strategies Steps supporting the exit strategy and facilitating its successful implementation include public health ( these include testing , contact tracing , quarantine and isolation , and surveillance ) , pharmaceutical ( such as treatment , drug therapies , and vaccination ) , and non - pharmaceuti - cal interventions ( NPIs - these include physical distanc - ing , use of face masks , and hygiene measures ) . Other restrictive NPIs such as stay at home , school closures , travel restrictions , border closures , and steps to address ventilation measures especially in closed spaces are implemented in varying degrees depending upon the number of cases ) . This review is focused on public health and NPIs as measures of exiting from a lockdown . Health system and public health capacity Along with ensuring physical distancing and reducing contacts to control the transmission , the purpose , and justification for lockdowns have been to strengthen the capacity of health systems . This would include not only the facility level capacity , but also the public health capacity in terms of testing , tracing , quarantine and isolation . a ) Testing and surveillance In the studies reviewed [ 10 , 17 , 24 , 44 – 52 ] , upscaling the antigen testing capacity is identified as a critical require - ment while planning for exiting the lockdown . Coun - tries that implemented testing at an early stage along with tracing and quarantine could effectively control the spread of COVID - 19 . For example , South Korea relied on ‘trace , test and treat’ strategy to control the epidemic without imposing nationwide lockdown [ 53 ] . This implies the need for extensive testing capacity before considering reopening ( refer to Table 6 ) . Review articles [ 10 , 24 , 48 , 49 , 51 ] included in this scop - ing review have emphasized the need for greater access to testing to allow the identification of new cases and clus - ters as early as possible . Massive testing of the healthy and infected population would be essential to inform policymakers about the effect of interventions during reopening . Modelling studies included in the review [ 17 , 21 , 45 – 47 , 54 – 57 ] have identified different effective testing strategies ( listed in Table 6 ) to support opening , post lockdown . Randazzo et al . [ 58 ] used wastewater surveillance and wastewater - based epidemiology to estimate the pres - ence and prevalence of COVID - 19 in communities . Findings suggest environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities as a tool for mapping high - risk areas during exit . Digital technology has been suggested for large - scale surveillance [ 59 ] and moni - toring of epidemic [ 60 ] to support exit strategies in the reviewed studies . b ) Contact tracing , quarantine , and isolation Improved health systems and public health capacity for contact tracing and ensuring quarantine and isolation are identified as prerequisites for opening up in the reviewed studies . This was necessary to identify and contain emerging clusters [ 26 , 27 , 61 – 64 ] . Page 10 of 16 Misra et al .

Country Study Testing strategy Effect of testing strategy to support existing from lockdown 1 Switzerland Muller et al . [ 45 ] Daily random testing • Daily random testing will reduce the delay between changes in policy and the observa - tion of their effects • Additional testing capacity of 15 , 000 per day carried out randomly would provide data about the evolution of the epidemic during exit . 2 UK Panovska - Griffith et al . [ 46 ] Active testing of symptomatic population Increased levels of testing ( between 59 and 87 % of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID - 19 infection ) and effective contact tracing and isolation for infected individuals can prevent rebound of the epidemic during reopening of schools and society in UK . 3 Mendoza , Argentina Mayorga et al . [ 47 ] Extensive testing capacity to detect asymp - tomatic individuals Massive COVID - 19 screening to detect around half of the asymptomatic and very mildly affected individuals would not need strict suppressive actions - if 45 % of asymp - tomatic individuals are detected through testing and are isolated , there would not be a need for lockdown . ( This modelling exercise was undertaken with assumptions - a ) imposing lockdown when ICU beds occupancy reaches 50 % , and b ) relaxing restrictions when this value reaches 30 % ) 4 India Gupta et al . [ 17 ] Increased testing Lower restrictive measures along with increased testing during lockdown relaxation have the same effect as stricter physical dis - tancing measures with lower levels of testing . 5 Italy Li et al . [ 21 ] Upscaling the testing capacity • True number of infected cases and relative testing capacity are better determinants to guide lockdown exit strategies , compared to R . • Testing capacity of at least 16 times the number of newly infected cases is required before considering exit at regional levels in Italy . 6 Australia Lokuge et al . [ 54 ] Community - based surveillance strategy using pooling of samples • Exhaustive testing of patients with respira - tory symptoms in the community is the most efficient and feasible means of detecting community transmission of COVID - 19 during relaxation of measures . • Pooling allows increased case detection when testing capacity is limited , even given reduced test sensitivity . 7 Italy Pernice et al . [ 55 ] Targeted testing in high - risk groups and contact tracing • Contact tracing and targeted testing in high - risk groups would provide the same result as larger number of untargeted ( or less targeted ) tests . • Targeted testing approach is more efficient and feasible . 8 NA Bej et al . [ 56 ] Pro - active testing ( testing beyond those who show symptoms ) • Compared effects of different exit strategies with high / low levels of pro - active testing . Strategies that lack high levels of pro - active testing led to a second wave of infection . 9 USA Tam et al . [ 57 ] Expanding testing capacity and encourag - ing early testing • Infection rate can be decreased by increas - ing the sum of testing rate and recovery rate of asymptomatic individuals , after lifting the stay - at - home orders . Page 11 of 16 Misra et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 Kretzschmar et al . [ 61 ] have examined different scenarios of isolation and contact tracing settings in combination with social distancing levels for a safe exit strategy . Their modelling study results emphasize tracing non - house - hold contacts during relaxation of restrictions . If not feasible due to public health system constraints , tracing and isolation of only household contacts is also found to significantly reduce the doubling time of the epidemic . A US - based modelling study [ 62 ] finds that increasing the capacity for detection , contact tracing and quarantine by at - least two folds would control the cases from ris - ing during medium risk reopening ( effective contact rate increased by three – five folds was considered as medium risk opening in the study ) . Contact tracing using digital technologies has been sug - gested in some of the reviewed studies [ 24 , 51 , 65 ] . The acceptability of tracing apps has shown mixed results in this review . A study in Germany [ 66 ] , found that people preferred to avoid mandatory tracing apps during exit strategy , while a cross - country study [ 67 ] from France , Germany , Italy , the UK , and the US found strong support for use of apps . Non‑pharmaceutical interventions a ) Lifting restrictions on physical distancing Ensuring strict physical distancing through lockdowns has helped to control the pandemic ; however , this has had a profound ill effect on the economy . Reviewed stud - ies examined various options for lifting physical distanc - ing without increasing COVID - 19 cases . We categorize these as below . Segmenting and shielding at‑risk population Continuing the restrictions and ensuring physical dis - tancing for at - risk population ( those above 65 years of age , people living in care institutions , and those with chronic conditions ) for an extended period compared to other individuals in society has been suggested in reviewed studies . For example , a UK - based modelling [ 68 ] study found that if restrictions are continued only for older ( 60 + ) and vulnerable people , there will be reduc - tion in hospitalization by 50 % , while if restrictions are continued for 50 + population with chronic diseases , the reduction will be by 57 % . Few other studies based in the UK [ 69 – 71 ] , France [ 26 , 72 ] , China [ 73 ] , Pakistan [ 74 ] , and Italy [ 75 ] have suggested a similar age - selective restriction strategy for opening up . A study from Bra - zil [ 76 ] refers to age - specific confinement as “vertical confinement” . This study finds “vertical confinement” would only be effective for all those over 50 years of age but this would then include the population in the work - ing - age group and thus is not recommended . A modelling paper [ 77 ] based in the UK suggests the strat - egy of segmenting and shielding the vulnerable . Dividing the population into groups that are relatively homoge - nous in healthcare needs is defined as segmenting . Those above the age of 70 years in receipt of government advice to shield / in care homes / receiving care at home are cat - egorized as vulnerable . A study done in Nepal [ 44 ] rec - ommends targeted closure and shielding of vulnerable and at - risk populations such as migrants , core case con - tacts , and family members . The exposure levels of house - hold contacts / contact with confirmed cases , exposure of border security forces , airport staff , health workers , and front - line workers should all be categorised in terms of high , medium , low , and no identifiable risk . This should be followed by active case management and monitoring based on asymptomatic and symptomatic cases . The principle supporting the theory of protecting the vul - nerable and allowing the healthy ones to carry out regular tasks assumes that it could help a majority of the popula - tion to return to normal . Risk classification tools to identify individuals who would require shielding during relaxation of interventions have been suggested in the studies [ 78 , 79 ] . Although effective , this strategy may not be acceptable and feasible in all contexts . As observed in study findings from Brazil [ 76 ] , such a strict age selective containment would not be possible in multi - generational households , especially in LMICs . Similarly , the implications of this strategy need to be interpreted along with considerations for its practical feasibility and potential wider benefits and drawbacks . Categorizing high‑risk places From the studies reviewed , mapping of places with high transmission risk , super - spreading events , hotspots , and predicting mobility patterns is suggested before opening [ 80 ] . This information would help in designing policies to keep active surveillance of such places or to keep these areas closed while lifting the lockdown . A review article [ 81 ] based on global data has identified indoor settings linked to increased risk of COVID - 19 transmission . Large numbers of cases were from hospi - tals and elderly care settings in Europe . Other clusters with more than 100 cases included large religious gather - ings , food processing plants , shopping places , and large Page 12 of 16 Misra et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 cohabiting settings ( worker dormitories , prisons , and ships ) . Settings with 50 - 100 cases included weddings , sports venues , bars , shopping places , and workplaces . Only a small number of clusters were related to schools and cases were most often reported among teachers and staff . An observational study [ 82 ] from eight high - income countries concurred with these findings . Other studies [ 83 – 85 ] based in high - income countries have identified schools as low - risk settings with minimal effect on transmission after their opening compared to other indoor settings . A UK - based modelling study [ 86 ] examined the effect of opening schools along with removing restrictions on differ - ent occupation groups and concluded increased transmis - sion , i . e . , R0 above one ( the basic reproduction number , R0 is the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population where every - one is susceptible [ 12 ] ) . Continued restriction on recrea - tional activities ( e . g . , restaurants and bars ) during exiting has been suggested in a modelling study based in high - income countries [ 87 ] . Daily contact rates Some modelling studies have suggested a combination of optimal daily contacts to bring R below one . A study based in the UK [ 88 ] suggests that while opening up , if the daily contact rate of an individual is maintained at five - six people , R would be reduced below one . For a contact rate of six - seven people , R may increase above one . For eight - nine people contact rate , health system capacity would be insufficient and may require another lockdown . Creating social bubbles A UK - based modelling study [ 89 ] examined the use of social bubbles or contact clustering to reduce contacts while opening from a lockdown . This means that two households would have exclusive contact and form a social bubble . Findings suggest that such a strategy can reduce COVID - related fatality by 42 % as opposed to unrestricted socializing . The study shows epidemic risk can be further reduced if the transmission risk within the bubble is minimised . In the reviewed studies , the importance of continuing some form of physical distancing during exit has been reiterated . E . g . , one of the modelling studies [ 90 ] con - cludes sensitivity of the second wave to physical distanc - ing rather than movements in the UK . Thus , indicating a need for physical distancing while opening up . b ) Use of Face Masks The universal use of face masks after relaxing restrictions has been suggested as an effective exit strategy . Wearing masks by at least 60 % of people was found to be a reason - able public health goal and at the same time a plausible strategy . It was found to be much easier than enforcing physical distancing in a modelling study in Australia [ 91 ] . This study found using only face masks reduced infec - tions by 54 % while using only physical distancing reduced infection by 24 . 7 % . Especially in dense areas , face mask use is effective . Another study [ 92 ] has shown that face mask use by infectious as well as the susceptible individuals is most effective as it reduces infection chances to 10 % compared to 90 % if none were wearing a mask . Wang et al . [ 93 ] con - ducted a modelling study using data from China , Italy , UK , and USA concluding the most effective exit strategy would be a combination of physical distancing and face mask use along with intense monitoring of the epidemic . c ) Relaxing travel restrictions During opening up , a sustainable border control policy should be in sync with internal control measures . A mod - elling study [ 94 ] based on global data suggests opening of borders of countries and states where COVID - 19 spread has already been successfully contained by internal meas - ures . Pre - departure screening and testing on arrival are sufficient to keep imported cases in check without any border / travel restrictions [ 95 ] . Another modelling study [ 96 ] based in the EU correlates a mobility model to pas - senger air traffic and finds unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID - 19 . This was especially so in Central Europe , Spain , and France . Network epidemiology can inform political deci - sion making and help countries exit from total lockdown . Discussion Two years since the first outbreak of COVID - 19 , and after almost a year and a half of varying restrictive meas - ures , countries had begun to open up from lockdowns in mid - 2021 . Countries that implemented moderate to severe measures to control the COVID - 19 transmission faced challenges . In particular , to devise a safe exit plan , which would limit the transmission and have minimum social and economic costs . Some countries have been reimposing restrictions in light of increasing cases and emergence of newer variants in November - December 2021 . Synthesis of the available evidence on exit strategies Page 13 of 16 Misra et al . BMC Public Health ( 2022 ) 22 : 488 can help in policy decision making and analysis of this was found lacking . This scoping review was undertaken to understand the different strategies that countries adopted to exit from lockdowns to mitigate the spread of COVID - 19 and to document the effects of these exit strategies . The majority of the studies adhering to the inclusion criteria were from the high - income countries ( 68 % ) and were based on epidemiological modelling exercises ( 76 % ) , and therefore the results need to be interpreted with caution . We have described the exit strategies around the themes of timing , processes , and supporting conditions for exit answering key questions about when , how , and what . We find the relaxation of restrictions is most appropriate when there is a decrease in the number of cases after the peak period for at least 2 weeks . This would prevent the health system from being overwhelmed . Determinants such as reduction in the reproduction number , a smaller susceptible population , considerations for the economy , liveli - hoods , and health system capacity are additional considerations before opening up . This corresponds to the WHO recommendation [ 97 ] to undertake a situational assessment of the intensity of transmis - sion and health system capacity , before deciding to lift restrictive measures . WHO’s guidance on imple - menting and adjusting the public health and social measures , emphasizes the importance of flexible decision making for exiting at local levels , in coor - dination with neighbouring areas at the sub - national as well as the national level [ 97 ] . Most of the reviewed studies suggest phase - wise exit to be more effective compared to a hard exit or cyclic lockdowns , considering public health , clinical and social factors . WHO has repeatedly suggested [ 97 , 98 ] slow , controlled and step - wise relaxation of measures . More - over , an interval of 2 weeks has been recommended to identify any adverse effects of such measures and adjust the next steps accordingly . This review suggests the importance of sufficient testing capacity and the need for extensive testing as necessary conditions while exiting . Almost all stud - ies recommend continued use of non - pharmaceu - tical interventions in different combinations when exiting from a lockdown , which need to be in place even after optimal vaccination coverage has been attained . This is also in line with the WHO recom - mendation [ 97 ] for continuously monitoring the transmission levels and adopting appropriate public health measures , even when vaccination has begun . The studies reviewed also suggest the need for the maintenance of strong infection control measures in health establishments . For international travel - lers coming from countries with an active outbreak , strict quarantine rules should continue . Strengthen - ing the public health system for detection , tracing , and quarantine should continue till vaccine coverage improves . Adopting a multi - pronged strategy consisting of these different approaches as per the context is rec - ommended by most studies we reviewed . In the high - income countries , there is a relatively larger proportion of formal sector workers and better health system capacity . Here , we note a reliance on increased testing capacity , and better surveillance to aid the phase - wise opening . In the low - and - middle - income countries , while the principles for opening up remain the same , studies have additionally suggested zonal lockdowns , local and context - specific identification of high - risk places and vulnerable individuals , and more adherence to non - pharmaceutical measures . This scoping review has a few limitations . First , only two databases were included in the search strat - egy , likely missing out on other published evidence . However , we expect to have covered the majority of published studies . Second , the review has included studies on the effects of exit strategies on COVID - 19 related outcomes . Effects on other outcomes such as social and economic aspects were not included . Effects of vaccination coverage on opening up weren’t studied as literature on this was in early stages while undertaking the review . Recent literature does point to significant effects of existing COVID vaccines on reducing disease severity ( hospitalization and deaths ) [ 99 ] , and on newer variants such as Omicron [ 100 ] . Improving vaccination coverage thus becomes an important component of exit strategy . However , due to global vaccine divide , ‘vaccination’ may not be a feasible strategy for many countries at the moment . Further research needs to be undertaken to under - stand effects of vaccines on exiting from lockdowns in different contexts . Conclusion Different approaches for exit strategies have been adopted by countries or suggested via modelling exer - cises in the review findings . These vary from imposing a phase - wise exit to a hard exit . Other strategies which consider vaccination coverage include constant partial lockdowns or a cyclic strategy for lockdown and relaxa - tion till optimum immunity is achieved . Out of these , the phase - wise exit with continuation of non - pharma - ceutical interventions appears to be optimal , as per the review findings . Page 14 of 16 Misra et al .
