Little is known about the mechanisms that control the organization of recycling endosomes and how they connect to receptor endocytosis . Here , we follow the endocytic journey of the T cell receptor ( TCR ) , from internalization at the plasma membrane to recycling back to the immunological synapse . We show that TCR triggering leads to its rapid uptake through a clathrin - independent pathway . Immediately after internalization , TCR is incorporated into a mobile and long - lived endocytic network demarked by the membrane - organizing proteins ﬂ otillins . Although ﬂ otillins are not required for TCR internalization , they are necessary for its recycling to the immunological synapse . We further show that ﬂ otillins are essential for T cell activation , supporting TCR nanoscale organization and signaling .

Central to the two - way relationship between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments is endocytic recycling 1 . Recycling returns endocytosed receptors to the plasma membrane and by doing so controls their level of surface expression and consequently the sensitivity of the cell to extra - cellular stimuli . Many cellular processes such as cytokinesis , transcytosis , morphogenesis , or synaptic transmission rely on recycling 2 . Targeted endocytic recycling to functionally distinct areas of the plasma membrane is one of the main mechanisms through which polarized cells generate and maintain a spatially distinct distribution of membrane proteins 2 , 3 . Polarized recycling is especially critical for cell migration 4 , cell cytokinesis 5 , the basolateral polarity of epithelial cells 3 , and T cell activation 6 , 7 . However , little is known about recycling endosome structure , composition , or how they ful ﬁ ll their function . In activated T cells , polarized endocytic recycling is the result of a sequence of cellular events starting with kinase - mediated signaling 8 and ending with the translocation of the microtubule - organization center ( MTOC ) and associated endosomes to the immunological synapse 9 . Endocytic recycling plays a funda - mental role in T cell activation 7 , 10 – 14 , ﬁ ne - tuning levels of T cell receptor ( TCR ) and effectors available for signaling , spatially organizing the immunological synapse 15 , 16 and directly con - tributing to signaling 17 – 19 . Despite their essential contribution to T cell activation , cellular mechanisms that coordinate inter - nalization of surface receptors with sustained delivery to the plasma membrane remain incompletely understood . The recy - cling machinery delivering TCR to the immunological synapse is complex . Several Rab GTPases 6 , the intra ﬂ agellar transport sys - tem protein IFT20 7 , 20 and sorting nexin 17 21 have been reported to bring TCR back to the cell surface . What uni ﬁ es these various elements of TCR recycling into a coherent molecular mechanism , and how TCR is sorted for recycling in intracellular compart - ments is currently unknown . The membrane organizing protein ﬂ otillins have been reported to de ﬁ ne a clathrin - independent endocytic route 22 , 23 and support the recycling of cell surface proteins 24 – 26 . Here we used a com - bination of approaches to investigate TCR at each step of its endocytic journey ; from the plasma membrane to endosomes and back at the cell surface . We show that in activated T cells TCR is internalized through a clathrin - independent pathway into a mobile and long - lived endocytic network supported by ﬂ otillins , which controls its recycling to the immunological synapse . In contrast to clathrin - coated vesicles , which dissociate after cargo delivery to intracellular compartments , ﬂ otillins were incorpo - rated at the level of the plasma membrane within the vesicles , building - up the TCR endocytic network . Our results further suggest that the recycling supported by ﬂ otillin - positive endo - somes provides a critical contribution to T cell activation by regulating the nanoscale organization of TCR at the immunolo - gical synapse and promoting phosphorylation of signaling proteins , and the nuclear import of transcription factors . Results T cell activation promotes T cell receptor complex subunit ζ ( TCR ζ ) but not Lck internalization . Internalization of T cell receptors and associated signaling proteins has been measured predominantly by ﬂ ow cytometry , which involves bulk mea - surements and provides no access to the dynamics of vesicle generation or movement . Here , we used a photoactivation approach to visualize and quantify the internalization of TCR ζ , and kinase Lck in resting and activated T cells ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Jurkat T cells expressing TCR ζ or Lck fused to a photoactivatable mCherry ( PA - mCherry ) were deposited on non - activating ( poly - L - lysine ) or activating ( antibodies against CD3 ε and CD28 ) cover glasses and imaged between 10 and 40 min after initial surface contact on a confocal microscope at 37 °C . Restricted areas of the plasma membrane were brie ﬂ y illuminated with 405 nm light to trigger localized photoactivation of PA - mCherry . Internalization of photoactivated TCR ζ or Lck was measured using a custom - made analysis routine that quanti ﬁ es the number of vesicles detected in each frame of the time series . This approach showed that TCR ζ underwent constitutive internalization in resting cells ( Fig . 1a , c and Supplementary Video 1 ) , in accordance with previous observations 13 , 27 . Endocytosis of Lck was less pro - nounced than that of TCR ζ . In activated cells , we observed that TCR ζ was rapidly internalized , with most initially photoactivated molecules incorporated into vesicles within 20 s after photo - activation ( Fig . 1b , c , and Supplementary Video 2 ) . By contrast , photoactivated Lck molecules were strictly retained at the cell surface in activated cells ( Fig . 1b , c and Supplementary Video 3 ) . We next investigated how the rapid endocytosis of TCR ζ was connected to TCR signaling , using Jurkat T cell lines lacking essential components of early TCR signaling ; the kinases Lck ( JCaM1 ) , and Zap70 ( P116 ) or the adaptor protein Lat ( knock - out by CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing ) . In the absence of Lck or Zap70 , TCR ζ was internalized signi ﬁ cantly less upon TCR activation than in wild - type cells , forming a similar number of vesicles as in resting cells ( Fig . 1d , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . However , knocking - out Lat , which is directly downstream of Zap70 in the TCR signaling cascade , did not impair TCR ζ endocytosis ( Fig . 1d ) . Altogether , these results demonstrate that kinase - mediated early signaling events immediately downstream of TCR activation promote fast and selective endocytosis of TCR ζ . TCR ζ complete endocytosis requires dynamin and actin . We next investigated the mechanisms responsible for scission of TCR ζ containing vesicles from the plasma membrane . Cells expressing TCR ζ - PA - mCherry were activated as in Fig . 1 and treated with 80 µM of the dynamin inhibitor dynasore 28 or 100 µM of the actin branching proteins Arp2 / 3 inhibitor CK666 29 . Neither treatment affected the number of vesicles detected with the analysis routine ( Supplementary Fig . 2a , b ) . However , the punctate TCR ζ - PA - mCherry structures identi ﬁ ed as vesicles were completely static — as demonstrated by the quanti ﬁ cation of their track length ( Fig . 1e , f ) — and showed increasing ﬂ uorescence intensity during the time series , even when located outside of the area initially illuminated with 405 nm light ( Fig . 1g , h ) . This can be explained if these vesicles were still connected to the plasma membrane in the dynasore / CK666 - treated cells , enabling them to accumulate photoactivated molecules of TCR ζ - PA - mCherry coming from the photoactivated region of the cell . Together with the fact that ﬂ otillin vesicles have been shown to rely on microtubules rather than actin for their mobility 26 , 30 , these observations suggest that the immobility of TCR ζ - PA - mCherry vesicles upon inhibition of dynamin activity and actin branching results from incomplete scission from the plasma membrane . TCR ζ endocytosis is clathrin independent . There is con ﬂ icting evidence as to whether TCR is internalized through a clathrin - dependent 31 , 32 or clathrin - independent 11 route . Thus , we used the clathrin inhibitor pitstop2 33 to investigate the role of clathrin in the rapid , activation - dependent endocytosis of TCR ζ . 6 µM pitstop2 drastically reduced the number of vesicles de ﬁ ned by clathrin - EGFP ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) and prevented internalization of transferrin ( Supplementary Fig . 2d ) , but did not ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 04088 - w 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 1597 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 04088 - w | www . nature . com / naturecommunications a b c f 0 10 20 30 50 M a x no . o f v e s i c l e s 40 TCR ζ Lck TCR ζ Lck Resting Activated 0 10 20 30 50 40 Jcam1 P116 LATKO 0 1 2 3 V e s i c l e s t r a ck l eng t h ( µ m ) Dyna - sore CK666 Untr .

On the contrary , clathrin inhibition increased the number of TCR ζ endocytic vesicles , suggesting a cross - regulation between clathrin - mediated endocytosis and an alternative clathrin - independent endocytic route 34 . We further tested the clathrin dependence of TCR ζ internalization in cells co - expressing TCR ζ - PA - mCherry and the c - terminal domain of AP180 ( AP180 - C ) , which blocks clathrin - coated pit formation 35 . AP180 - C did not prevent TCR ζ internalization ( Fig . 2a , b ) , further indicating that TCR ζ endocytosis does not require the formation of clathrin - coated pits in activated T cells . To con ﬁ rm these ﬁ ndings , we assessed to what extent clathrin - coated vesicles coincided with endocytosed TCR ζ .

Taking into account the average size of vesicles and the resolution of confocal microscopy , a vesicle in the ﬁ rst channel was considered to be the same vesicle as that in the second channel if its nearest neighbor in the second channel was within 320 nm . In accordance with the results obtained with pitstop2 , endocytic vesicles de ﬁ ned by TCR ζ - PA - mCherry did not coincide with vesicles de ﬁ ned by clathrin - EGFP more than with vesicles randomly distributed throughout the cell ( 11 % , Fig . 2c ) . Importantly , vesicles de ﬁ ned by clathrin - EGFP did overlap in space and time with the canonical clathrin cargo transferrin , labelled with Alexa488 , signi ﬁ cantly more than they did with randomly distributed vesicles ( 41 . 7 % , Fig . 2c ) . TCR ζ is internalized in vesicles positive for ﬂ otillin - 2 . In order to further characterize the clathrin - independent endocytic route mediating TCR internalization , we investigated the membrane - organizing proteins ﬂ otillin - 1 and 2 that are known to support clathrin - independent endocytosis 22 , 23 .

In line with these results , ﬂ otillin - 2 positive vesicles shared the same actin requirement as TCR ζ for ﬁ ssion from the plasma membrane ; Arp2 / 3 inhibition by CK666 did not affect the movement of clathrin - coated vesicles but resulted in immobilized punctate structures de ﬁ ned by ﬂ otillin2 - EGFP ( Fig . 2e , f ) . Interestingly , pitstop2 had the same positive regulation on vesicles de ﬁ ned by ﬂ otillin - 2 ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) than it had on TCR ζ endocytic vesicles ( Fig . 2b ) .

TCR ζ is internalized into a ﬂ otillin - positive endocytic network . To gain a better insight into the endocytic pathway demarked by ﬂ otillins in T cells , we compared internalization of clathrin - PA - mCherry and ﬂ otillin2 - PA - mCherry in activated T cells . Shortly after photoactivation , we detected a similar number of vesicles for clathrin and ﬂ otillin ( Fig . 3a , b ) . The number of clathrin - PA - mCherry vesicles decreased with time ( Fig . 3c , d ) , probably due to the dissociation of the clathrin coat 37 . By contrast , the number of ﬂ otillin2 - PAmCherrry vesicles remained stable for at least 250 s following photoactivation ( Fig . 3d ) . In activated T cells , vesicles containing TCR ζ show a radial movement to and from a central endosomal structure visible at the center of the immunological synapse , whose location coincides with the MTOC 16 ( Supple - mentary Fig . 4a ) . Vesicles de ﬁ ned by ﬂ otillin2 - PA - mCherry moved continuously between the periphery ( out ) and the center ( in ) of the immunological synapse ( Fig . 3e , g ) and did not accumulate in the central endosomal region that was identi ﬁ ed by its high ﬂ uorescence intensity ( Fig . 2e , Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Consistent with coat dissociation , clathrin - coated vesicles did not display the same dynamics , as their number decreased equally over time at the center and periphery of the cell ( Fig . 3f , g ) . Similar to vesicles de ﬁ ned by ﬂ otillin2 - PA - mCherry , the number of vesicles containing photoactivated TCR ζ remained stable up to 250 s after photoactivation ( Fig . 3i ) and moved continuously between the periphery and center of the immunological synapse ( Fig . 3j ) . The number of TCR ζ - PA - mCherry containing vesicles remained stable for even up to 450 s after the initial photo - activation ( Fig . 3h ) . Repetitive photoactivation of TCR ζ - PA - mCherry at the same plasma membrane area every 8 s led to a constant increase in the number of TCR ζ - PA - mCherry vesicles ( Fig . 3h , i ) . This suggests that TCR ζ - PA - mCherry molecules diffused fast enough to at least partially replete the photoactivated region of interest within the 8 s between the photoactivation pulses . The steady number of vesicles for 450 s following one activation and the increasing number of vesicles resulting from repetitive photoactivation indicate that , following internalization , TCR ζ is not returned to the plasma membrane and remains in endocytic compartments for a signi ﬁ cant amount of time . Alto - gether , these data suggest that ﬂ otillin - positive vesicles de ﬁ ne a mobile endocytic network that contributes to TCR ζ intracellular traf ﬁ cking . Importantly , ﬂ otillins remain in the vesicles con - stituting this network after endocytosis , in contrast to clathrin that is not incorporated into the intracellular compartments to which it delivers cargo 37 . Flotillins are required to recycle but not to endocytose TCR . We set out to determine the precise contribution of the endocytic network de ﬁ ned by ﬂ otillins in TCR ζ endocytic traf ﬁ cking . We generated a Jurkat T cell line in which both ﬂ otillin - 1 and ﬂ otillin - 2 were knocked - out using CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Surprisingly , photoactivation experiments did not reveal any difference in the dynamics or extent of the formation of TCR ζ - PA - mCherry endocytic vesicles in ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO T cells compared to WT T cells ( Fig . 4a – c , Supplementary Video 4 ) , suggesting that ﬂ otillins do not con - tribute to TCR endocytosis . Flotillin knock - out had no observable effect either on the clathrin - mediated transferrin internalization ( Supplementary Fig . 5b - d ) . The ﬂ otillin - independence of TCR endocytosis was further con ﬁ rmed using a ﬂ ow cytometry - based internalization assay . TCR complexes present at the cell surface were labeled with activating anti - CD3 ε biotinylated antibody in the presence of co - stimulatory anti - CD28 antibody at 4 °C to prevent endocytosis . T cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 0 , 5 , 10 , or 20 min and the amount of non - internalized cell - surface TCR was detected with ﬂ uorescent streptavidin ( Fig . 4d and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . In line with the data obtained using photoactivation , ﬂ ow cytometry revealed no difference in TCR internalization between ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO and WT T cells ( Fig . 4e , f ) . While our data clearly showed that TCR ζ is internalized in an endocytic network marked by ﬂ otillins , ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO T cells did not show any impairment in TCR endocytosis . Thus , in order to identify the function of ﬂ otillin - positive endosomes in intracel - lular traf ﬁ cking of TCR , we investigated how knocking - out ﬂ otillins impacted TCR endocytic recycling . To do so , we measured recycling of TCR complexes back to the plasma membrane using a ﬂ ow cytometry - based antibody feeding assay 14 . T cells were incubated with activating biotinylated antibody against CD3 ε in the presence of co - stimulatory anti - CD28 antibody at 37 °C for 40 min to allow TCR internalization . Antibodies bound to the remaining TCR at the cell surface were then blocked with unlabeled streptavidin . Recycled TCR com - plexes were detected at different time points after the surface block using ﬂ uorescently labeled streptavidin ( Fig . 4g ) . T cells lacking ﬂ otillins showed a signi ﬁ cant reduction in the number of TCR complexes recycled to the plasma membrane from 10 min after the beginning of the recycling in comparison with WT T cells ( Fig . 4h , i ) . To determine if the defect of recycling in the ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO T cells would lead to an accumulation of endosomes containing TCR ζ , we measured the number of TCR ζ - PA - mCherry positive vesicles 10 min after photoactivation . At this time point , Flotillin1 / 2 KO T cells had a higher count of TCR ζ - PA - mCherry positive vesicles than the WT cells ( Fig . 4j , k ) . This ﬁ nding suggests that TCR ζ accumulated in intracellular compartments because of the recycling defect in cells lacking ﬂ otillins . These results demonstrate that although ﬂ otillins do not mediate TCR internalization , they are essential to TCR endocytic recycling during T cell activation . Flotillins spatially organize TCR ζ endosomes in activated T cells . In order to understand the role played by ﬂ otillin - mediated recycling in delivery of TCR to the immunological synapse upon activation , Jurkat T cells expressing TCR ζ - mCherry Fig . 4 Flotillin expression is required for recycling of TCR but not for its internalization . a Flotillin knock - out Jurkat T cells expressing TCR ζ - PA - mCherry , activated on anti - CD3 ε - coated and anti - CD28 - coated surfaces , photoactivated on outer membrane region of interest , and subsequently imaged for 250 s . b Number of PA - mCherry vesicles detected for each frame during the time of acquisition . c Maximum number of PA - mCherry vesicles detected in a given frame for Flotillin1 / 2 KO T cells and WT T cells ( dotted line ) . d Diagram of internalization ﬂ ow cytometry assay . e Mean ﬂ uorescent intensity ( MFI ) at the surface of 50 , 000 Jurkat T cells ( Left : wildtype ; Right : Flotillin1 / 2 KO ) stained with an activating antibody against CD3 ε and allowed to internalize TCR complexes for 0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 min . f Decrease of MFI at indicated time points relative to t = 0 . g Diagram of antibody feeding assay . h MFI of 50 , 000 Jurkat T cells ( Left : wildtype ; Right : Flotillin - 1 / - 2 KO ) allowed to recycle TCR for 0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 min after having internalizing TCR complexes labelled with an activating antibody against CD30 ε for 40 min . i MFI increase at indicated time points relative to t = 0 . j Images of WT and ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO cells on activated surfaces and expressing TCR ζ - PA - mCherry at 1 and 10 min after photoactivation . k Number of PA - mCherry vesicles detected at 10 min after photoactivation .

To quantify TCR ζ subcellular localization , we measured mCherry ﬂ uorescent intensity in three different regions of the cells : ( a ) at the immu - nological synapse , ( b ) directly behind the synapse , and ( c ) in the plasma membrane distal to the immunological synapse ( Fig . 5a ) . Intensities at the immunological synapse and endosomes were normalized to the intensity measured at the distal region to correct for different expression levels . We detected ﬁ ve times less TCR ζ at the immunological synapse and endosomes in Flotillin1 / 2 KO than in WT T cells ( Fig . 5b ) , illustrating that ﬂ otillins are required for delivery and recruitment of TCR to the immu - nological synapse . We further used total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscopy ( TIRF ) to quantify the spatial organi - zation of TCR ζ subsynaptic endosomes in cells expressing TCR ζ - mCherry and ﬁ xed after 10 min of activation on anti - CD3 ε - coated and anti - CD28 - coated glass surfaces . To assess the distribution of TCR ζ - mCherry signal , we developed a measure that re ﬂ ected the signal compaction relative to the cell area . The most concentrated the signal could theoretically be if it resided within a single pixel ( intensity compactness = 1 ) in contrast to being equally distributed across all pixels within the cell ( intensity compactness = 0 ) . Cells lacking ﬂ otillins showed signi ﬁ cantly more dispersed TCR ζ endosomes than WT cells ( Fig . 5c , d ) . Together with the data obtained with Jurkat – Raji B - cell conjugates , this result demonstrates that ﬂ otillins play a determinant role in the spatial organization of TCR ζ endosomes in activated T cells . Flotillin controls TCR ζ cell surface nanoscale organization . We next used single molecule localization microscopy to investigate how the absence of ﬂ otillin could affect the spatial organization of TCR at the plasma membrane . Jurkat WT and ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO T cells expressing TCR ζ fused to the photoswitchable ﬂ uorescent protein PS - CFP2 were ﬁ xed with paraformaldehyde 10 min after contact with non - activating ( antibody against CD90 ) 38 and activating ( antibodies against CD3 ε and CD28 ) coated surfaces 39 , 40 . Using a DBSCAN approach to identify clusters 39 , 41 , we found that ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO T cells had a signi ﬁ cantly lower number of TCR ζ clusters per µm 2 at the area of activation than their wildtype counterpart ( Fig . 6a , b ) .

The 30 ± 4 nm population — promoted by T cell activation — was completely absent from ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO cells ( Fig . 6d ) . The 16 ± 2 nm cluster population seemed to be insen - sitive to ﬂ otillin depletion , suggesting that the larger 30 ± 4 nm population does not result from concatenation of the smaller 16 ± 2 nm clusters . Pharmacological inhibition of recycling with primaquine 42 led to a similar reduction in the number of TCR ζ molecules , cluster number and importantly to the disappearance of the 30 ± 4 nm cluster population as observed in ﬂ otillin - 1 / - 2 KO cells ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Taken together , these results show that ﬂ otillins contribute to the spatial organization of TCR ζ molecules at the cell surface by promoting a speci ﬁ c activation - related population of TCR ζ clusters . Flotillins are required for T cell activation . Beyond the nanos - cale organization of TCR at the immunological synapse , TCR polarized endocytic recycling is required at almost every step of T cell activation for cellular mechanisms such as formation of T cell – antigen - presenting cells conjugates 43 and TCR - triggered signaling 14 , 15 . To determine the contribution of ﬂ otillin - mediated TCR recycling in conjugate formation , we stained Jur - kat T cells in red using cell viability dye and Raji B - cells in green using CFDA .

Flotillin1 / 2 KO T cells showed a signi ﬁ cant reduction in phosphorylation of TCR ζ , Zap70 , and extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) upon T cell activation compared to WT cells ( Fig . 7c ) . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of T – B cell conjugates with antibodies against phosphorylated TCR ζ and phosphorylated Zap70 revealed the same tendency , suggest - ing that the conjugates that were formed had impaired signaling but were at least partially functional ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Arti ﬁ cially aggregating ﬂ otillin - positive endosomes with the optogenetic tool Cry2Clust as recently done for Rab11 44 , 45 reduced the percentage of Jurkat T cells positive for phosphory - lated TCR in response to TCR activation ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . This suggests that impaired T cell activation in ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO T cells is the result of the impaired TCR recycling observed in these cells . c 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 5 10 15 20 I n t eg r a t ed T SA d den s i t y o v e r nu c l e u s 0 60 40 20 80 WT FlotKO # 1 FlotKO # 2 TCR stim : – + – + – + WT FlotKO # 1 FlotKO # 2 e WT FlotKO # 1 N on - a c t .

Quanti ﬁ cation of the levels of NFAT or TSAd co - localizing with the nucleus identi ﬁ ed by Hoechst staining showed that their nuclear translocation following T cell activation was abolished by ﬂ otillin knock - out ( Fig . 7d – g ) . We con ﬁ rmed the importance of ﬂ otillins for T cell activation in primary CD4 T cells isolated from the spleen of Flotillin2 KO mice 48 . Because splenocytes isolated from these mice had no detectable ﬂ otillin1 expression ( Fig . 8a ) , T cells isolated from these mice were de facto double KO . CD4 T cells were stimulated on anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 surfaces for 20 and 36 h and stained with antibodies against CD69 and CD25 , which are canonical markers of T cell activation . T cells isolated from ﬂ otillin - 2 KO mice had signi ﬁ cantly less surface expression of CD69 and CD25 after 20 and 36 h , respectively . This demonstrates a role for ﬂ otillins in activation of primary T cells . Altogether , our investigation of the functional consequences of ﬂ otillins KO suggest that ﬂ otillin - mediated TCR endocytic recycling is required for various cellular events critical to T cell activation , from conjugation with antigen - presenting cells to early and late signaling events . Discussion How endocytic recycling operates is incompletely understood , despite its importance in many cellular processes . In this work , we uncovered a novel role for the membrane - organizing ﬂ otillins in organizing the recycling of cell surface receptors . We showed that TCR triggering leads to its rapid , clathrin - independent uptake . Immediately after internalization , TCR endocytic vesicles are incorporated into a network of mobile intracellular compart - ments de ﬁ ned by the membrane - organizing proteins ﬂ otillins . We further showed that although ﬂ otillins are not required for TCR internalization , they are necessary for recycling TCR to the immunological synapse and for its nanoscale organization at the plasma membrane . More importantly , our results suggest that the recycling supported by ﬂ otillin - positive endosomes could be essential to full T cell activation in Jurkat and in primary CD4 T cells . Flotillins are indeed required for conjugation of T cells with antigen - presenting cells , phosphorylation of TCR signaling proteins and the nuclear import of transcription factors , as well as for CD69 and CD25 surface expression in primary CD4 T cells . Collectively , our data support a model in which specialized endocytic sorting machinery underpinned by ﬂ otillins promotes the recycling of internalized TCR complexes to the immunolo - gical synapse to support T cell activation . A central aspect of endocytic recycling is the sorting of cargo to membrane domains that eventually bud from recycling endo - somes to return to the plasma membrane . Sorting in endosomes relies on soluble tetrameric adaptors , such as AP - 1 , AP - 3 and the Golgi - localizing γ - ear containing ADP ribosylation factor - binding protein ( GGA ) family 49 , 50 . These adaptors initiate for - mation of recycling vesicles by recruiting cargos , directly binding to consensus sequences on the cargo cytosolic domains 51 . While it has been shown that ﬂ otillins can in ﬂ uence endosomal sorting through binding to this type of cytosolic consensus sequence 52 , TCR ζ does not display such a binding motif . Instead of direct binding , TCR and ﬂ otillins interact within cholesterol - enriched membrane domains , an association increased upon TCR triggering 53 , 54 . These interactions could for instance be respon - sible for the change in TCR clustering at the plasma membrane that we observed in the ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO T cells . Similarly , con - centration of TCR complexes in ﬂ otillin - rich membrane domains at the surface of intracellular compartments could support a mechanism to sort them for recycling to the immunological synapse . In the same line , it has recently been shown that cargos internalized through a clathrin - independent route bene ﬁ t from facilitated sorting in endosomes by remaining compartmentalized within endosomal membrane domains 55 . Our data suggests that such a compartmentalization of TCR throughout internalization and recycling is a key element of T cell activation . In this context , it is possible that the recycling of TCR complexes within ﬂ otillin positive vesicles contribute to organize the clustering of TCR at the plasma membrane . Unlike AP - 1 and AP - 3 and GGAs , whose subcellular locali - zation is con ﬁ ned to endosomes , ﬂ otillins are present at the plasma membrane and in TCR ζ endocytic vesicles . Our results suggest ﬂ otillins might provide an identi ﬁ cation mark to the endocytic cycle of TCR , allowing speci ﬁ c TCR complexes from the plasma membrane to be incorporated into speci ﬁ c recycling compartments . A similar mechanism has been observed in adherent cells where loss of adhesion triggers internalization of lipid raft components and GPI - anchored proteins through clathrin - independent route , while re - adhesion promotes their Arf6 - mediated recycling to the plasma membrane 56 . Like our observations on ﬂ otillin - mediated recycling , Arf6 is often required for recycling of cargos internalized through a clathrin - independent pathway , but not for their endocytosis 57 . This sug - gests that the relationship between Arf6 and ﬂ otillins in polarized recycling is worth further investigation . Arf6 - associated recycling and recycling of proteins internalized through clathrin - independent pathways are associated with endosomes of speci ﬁ c morphologies and dynamics 57 – 60 . Our data revealed that the TCR endocytic network delineated by ﬂ otillins has a distinct morphology and dynamics , consisting of long - lived vesicles that persistently move behind the immunological Fig . 7 Flotillin expression is required for conjugate formation and T cell signaling . a Representative ﬂ ow cytometry dot plots of wildtype and Flotillin1 / 2 KO Jurkat T cells conjugated to SEE pulsed Raji B cells and stained with cell viability dye and CFDA , respectively . b Percentage of stable T – B cell conjugates determined as violet dye and CFDA double positives , relative to total cell population . c Flow cytometry quanti ﬁ cation of WT and ﬂ otillin1 / 2 KO Jurkat T cells activated with soluble CD3 ε and CD28 and ﬁ xed prior or 5 , 10 , and 20 min after activation .

Hence , ﬂ otillins might further control TCR recycling by establishing a previously unobserved type of endosome . In summary , we show that compartmentalization of TCR into a specialized sorting compartment demarked by ﬂ otillins controls recycling of TCR to the immunological synapse . Consistent with our ﬁ ndings , multiple evidence supports the idea that clathrin - independent endocytosis of surface proteins is connected to a speci ﬁ c recycling apparatus 55 , 56 , 58 , 60 , 61 . It would be interesting to determine if the endocytic network we uncovered contributes to the polarized recycling of cell surface proteins in other cell types during processes , such as cell migration 4 , cell cytokinesis 5 , and maintaining of basolateral polarity of epithelial cells 3 . Many questions remain as to which molecular mechanisms drive the clathrin - independent endocytosis of TCR , how the mobile endocytic network demarked by ﬂ otillin functions , and how TCR recycling actually supports signaling events and the nuclear translocation of transcription factors .

For live cell imaging , cells were imaged within 20 min after their deposition on the coverslips . For pitstop2 ( Abcam ) treatment , Jurkat T cells were seeded on 10 µg / ml anti - CD3 ε - coated and anti - CD28 coated coverslips and 6 µM of the inhibitor was added 5 min after activation . T cells were allowed to activate for further 5 – 10 min before imaging . For dynasore and CK666 treatments , cells were activated on 10µg / ml anti - CD3 ε and anti - CD28 coverslips for 10 min and the inhibitor was added to cells at a concentration of 100 and 80 µM , respectively . For photo - activation localization microscopy ( PALM ) , cells were subsequently ﬁ xed in 3 . 7 % EM - grade paraformaldehyde ( C004 , ProScitech ) for 15min at RT , washed , and resuspended in RPMI culture medium . For transferrin internalization , transfected Jurkat T cells were washed once with 1xPBS , resuspended in serum - free OptiMEM medium ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , and placed on ice for 10min to prevent endocytosis . Alexa488 - conjugated transferrin ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , USA ) was added to T cells at 25µg / ml ( 5 µl / ml ) and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min . After incubation , cells were washed with 1xPBS , resuspended in OptiMEM medium , activated on 10 µg / ml anti - CD3 ε and anti - CD28 - coverslips for 10min at 37°C and imaged . For immunostaining , cells were ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % EM - grade paraformaldehyde ( C004 , ProScitech ) for 15 min at RT . After ﬁ xation , cells were permeabilized with 100 μ g / ml lysolecithin , blocked in 5 % BSA and probed with primary and secondary antibodies sequentially . We used DAPI ( 62248 , 1 : 10 , 000 , Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) for nuclei , phospho - TCR ζ ( Y142 ) ( 558486M , 1 : 20 , BD Biosciences ) with secondary antibody Donkey anti - Goat DyLight488 ( ab96935 ; 1 : 200 , Abcam ) , TSAd ( bs - 3858R ; 1 : 100 , Bioss antibodies ) , NFAT and phosphor - Zap70 ( Y319 ) ( D43B1 and 2701 ; 1 : 100 and 1 : 100 , Cell Signaling Technologies ) with secondary antibody Goat anti - Rabbit Alexa647 ( 111 - 606 - 047 ; 1 : 100 , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) . For the conjugation assay , 1 ×10 6 / ml Raji B - cells were incubated with 2µg / ml highly puri ﬁ ed staphylococcal enterotoxins ( SEE ; Toxin Technology Inc . ) for 1h at 37°C , washed , and pelleted ( 200g , 5min , 37°C ) with equal amount of Jurkat T cells ( or derived knock - outs ) . Subsequently , the mixture of T - cells and B - cells is incubated for 10 min at 37°C . Hereafter , the pellet was carefully resuspended and ∼ 0 . 5 ×10 6 cells were applied on a poly - L - lysine - coated coverslip . The cells were allowed to adhere on the coverslip prior to ﬁ xation with 3 . 7 % ( vol / vol ) EM - grade paraformaldehyde ( C004 , ProScitech ) for 15min at RT . Poly - L - lysine coverslips were prepared by incubating clean 18 mm coverslips ( Marien ﬁ eld ) for at least 1 h at 37°C with 0 . 001 % ( vol / vol ) poly - L - lysine ( P4957 ; Sigma ) . Flow cytometry . For the CD3 - internalization assay , Jurkat T cells ( WT or ﬂ otillin - 1 / - 2 KO ) were incubated with 1µM biotinylated CD3 ε ( 16 - 0037 ; eBioscience ) and 1µM non - biotinylated CD28 ( 16 - 0289 ; eBioscience ) antibodies in solution at 4°C to allow binding but not internalization . Upon removal of unbound antibodies by extensive washing of the cells with PBS , T cells were incubated for 5 , 10 , or 20 min at 37 °C . Antibody bound and surface - exposed CD3 ε molecules were stained by Alexa647 - streptavadin and the percentage of internalized CD3 ε molecules is the mean ﬂ uorescent intensity ( MFI ) of timepoint 0 minus the MFI at the indicated timepoint . To determine the recycling of CD3 molecules , T cells were incubated with 1µM biotinylated CD3 ε ( 16 - 0037 ; eBioscience ) and 1µM non - biotinylated CD28 ( 16 - 0289 ; eBioscience ) antibodies in solution at 37°C to allow binding and internalization . Subsequently , surface - exposed CD3 molecules were blocked by unlabelled streptavidin . Hereafter , re - surfacing of unblocked biotinylated CD3 ε molecules was determined by staining with Alexa647 - streptavidin after 5 , 10 , or 20 min incubation at 37°C . The increased MFI relative to timepoint 0 correlates with the amount of recycled CD3 molecules . In order to determine T cell receptor signaling , we activated Jurkat T cells ( WT or Flotillin1 / 2 KO ) for the indicated time with 1µM biotinylated CD3 ε ( 16 - 0037 ; eBioscience ) and 1µM non - biotinylated CD28 ( 16 - 0289 ; eBioscience ) in solution . Subsequently , these activated cells were ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % ( vol / vol ) PFA ( 20 min RT ) and permeabilized for 30min on ice by slowly adding ice - cold methanol to a ﬁ nal concentration of 90 % ( vol / vol ) . Hereafter , the cells were stained with antibodies against phosphorylated TCR ζ ( 558489 ; BD Phos ﬂ ow ) , Zap70 ( 2704S ; Cell Signaling Technologies ) , and ERK ( 9101S ; Cell Signaling Technologies ) . To quantify conjugate formation , Jurkat T cells and Raji B - cells were prepared as described above with minor modi ﬁ cations . T cells were stained with Fixable Violet Dead Stain kit ( L - 34963 ; Life Technologies ) and B cells with carboxy ﬂ uorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ( CFDA ; Invitrogen ) prior to conjugation . Conjugates were de ﬁ ned as the double - positive population . For the primary cell assay , cells were collected at the indicated time points and prepared for surface labelling . Cells were stained with BV - 421 anti - mouse CD25 ( Biolegend , Cat . 102033 ) , APC anti - mouse CD3 ε ( BD Biosciences , Cat . 553066 ) , and FITC anti - mouse CD69 ( BD Biosciences , Cat . 557392 ) . Samples were acquired using an LSR - II ﬂ ow cytometer ( Becton - Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) and analyzed using FlowJo software 10 ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR ) . All ﬂ ow - cytometry - based assays were performed on a BD FACSCanto II or a BD LSR II . Auto ﬂ uorescence in a dump gate and the size of the population in FSC and SSC dot plot are used to distinguish live and dead cells . Doublets were eliminated by using a pulse geometry gate with FSC - H and FSC - A , except in the conjugation assay in which it con ﬁ rmed formed conjugates . Microscopy . Fixed and live - cell confocal microscopy were performed on a Zeiss LSM780 and / or LSM880 laser - scanning confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Germany ) that is equipped with an argon laser ( 405 , 488 nm ) , a diode pump solid state laser ( 561 , 647 nm ) , and a live - cell incubation chamber ( Pecon ) . GFP constructs were exited using the 488 nm line of the argon laser source , while PA - mCherry tagged proteins were excited with the 561 nm laser line . Images were acquired with a 100 ×1 . 4NA DIC M27 Apo - Plan oil immersion objective ( Zeis , Germany ) and GaAsP - PMTs in simultaneous , bidirectional scanning mode , resulting in two - color frame recording almost every 10 s . For each channel the pinhole was set to 1 Airy Unit . Live - cell TIRF and PALM images were acquired on a total internal re ﬂ ection ﬂ uorescence microscope ( ELYRA ; Zeiss ) with a 100× oil - immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1 . 46 . For PS - CFP2 , 8 μ W of 405 - nm laser radiation and imaging of green - converted PS - CFP2 with 18mW of 488 - nm light were used for photoconversion . For PALM , 20 , 000 images were acquired per sample with a cooled , electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( iXon DU - 897D ; Andor ) with an exposure time of 18 ms . Recorded images were analyzed with Zeiss ZEN Black software . Drifting of the sample during acquisition was corrected relative to the position of surface - immobilized 200 - nm colloidal gold beads ( BBInternational ) placed on each sample . Photoactivation was achieved by illuminating a subset of the cell outer membrane with a 7 . 2 µW 405nm laser pulse with 12 . 24 µs per pixel dwell time . Optogenetic clustering . Flotillin2 - ECFP - CIB1 and ﬂ otillin2 - mCerulean - Cry2Clust were designed based on Nguyen et al . 44 and Park et al . 45 , respectively . Jurkat T cells were transfected with either ﬂ otillin2 - ECFP - CIB1 or ﬂ otillin2 - mCerulean - Cry2Clust 24 h prior to use . In a ﬂ at bottom 12 - well plate ( 3513 , Corning ) , transfected cells were exposed to 470 nm blue light from an LED tran - silluminator ( LB - 16 , Maestro Gen ) with a 10 s on / off pulse for 10min at 37°C prior to activation , following which 1µl of anti - CD3 ε and anti - CD28 were added to induce T cell activation . Blue light exposure was continued for a further 5 min , following which cells were transferred onto ice , pelleted and resuspended in cold 3 . 7 % PFA and ﬁ xed on ice for 30 min . Untransfected WT and ﬂ otillin - KO Jurkat T cells were simultaneously activated for 5min without blue light exposure , fol - lowed by ﬁ xation . Cells were then washed 3× in cold PBS and permeabilised with Cytoperm Plus ( 554715 , BD Bioscience ) for 10 min . Following ﬁ xation , cells were washed 1× with PBS and incubated with anti - phosphorylated TCR diluted in PBS + 5 % BSA for 2 h at 4°C . Cells were subsequently washed prior to ﬂ ow cytometry . Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FacsCantoX20 . Intact sells were gated using FCS and SSC . Gating for transfected and anti - phosphorylated TCR647 - stained cells was determined using untransfected , unstained cells , and adjusted using transfected only and activated , anti - phosphorylated TCR647 - stained only cells . Cyan ﬂ uorescence was excited with 450 nm laser and detected using a blue / green 535nm ﬁ lter , while Alexa647 ﬂ uorescence was excited with 640 nm laser and detected with a red 670 nm ﬁ lter . Imaging analysis . Vesicle count & cross channel nearest neighbor distances : Images were analyzed with custom written Matlab vesicle tracking and cross - channel nearest - neighbor distance evaluation software . From the two - channel images , the EGFP channel served as a mask for the cell body , as well as marking the central endosomal region , if necessary for analysis , using user - set thresholds . Vesicles in both channels were separated by intensity - based thresholding from the background of the spatial band - pass - ﬁ ltered image ( pass band of 2 – 9 pixels ) and localized . Counts in each channel and cross - channel nearest - neighbor distances for all vesicles were evaluated . Random cross - channel nearest - neighbor distances were calculated by shuf ﬂ ing the time information for the vesicle localizations before performing the nearest - neighbor calculations . A GUI application and all source code for this analysis is freely available from the author ’ s GitHub repo at https : / / github . com / PRNicovich / PAVesT . git . Nuclear translocation of transcription factors NFAT and TSAd was determined by using ImageJ / Fiji Plugin TANGO 62 and its included Nuclear Edge Detector for nuclear segmentation and determining integrated intensity density . Vesicle tracking : we used DiaTrack 3 . 04 PRO [ Vallotton et al Tritrack ] . At ﬁ rst , we ﬁ ltered the image with a Gaussian ﬁ lter to obtain one kernel per vesicle . Secondly , we manually selected the region covering the inside of the cell . Hereafter , DiaTrack tracks the vesicles and tracks with appropriate speed and lifetime of at least ﬁ ve frames were selected . Displacement and speed was exported in . mat ﬁ le into MATLAB R2014b ( Mathworks ) and relevant ﬁ gures were generated from this data in Graphpad Prism 6 . 00 for Windows ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla CA ) . Vesicle membrane intensity measurements were performed using Fiji based on the channel containing the PA - mCherry - labeled proteins of interest . PA - region was determined in frame three ( ﬁ rst frame after 405nm pause - mediated ﬂ uorophore activation = 17 s after start of acquisition ) and added to ROI manager . Average pixel intensity in PA region was measured at the indicated timepoints / frames . Intensities were normalized to the measured intensity of frame 3 ( ﬁ rst frame after 405 nm pause - mediated ﬂ uorophore activation = 17s after start of acquisition ) . Plasma membrane mCherry - labeled protein intensity was measured with Fiji after background substraction in selected ROIs that mark the plasma membrane , a directly attached region underneath the surface ROI , and a region of the membrane opposite from the cell – cell interaction site ( distal region ) . For comparison , immune NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 04088 - w ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 1597 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 04088 - w | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 13 synapse and directly attached region intensities are normalized using the distal region its intensity . Intensity compactness : The compactness of intensity was measured on the premise that the most compact a signal can be is if it were all concentrated within a single pixel . This measure ranges from 1 , representing all the intensity residing within a single pixel , to 0 , where the signal is equally distributed across all pixels . Intensitycompactness ¼ P x (cid:2) x j j 2 P x ð Þ (cid:2) 2 x The single - molecule localization microscopy data was ﬁ rst analyzed with Zen 2012 Black edition software ( Zeiss MicroImaging ) . After Gaussian and Laplace ﬁ ltering , events were judged to have originated from single molecules when I − M > 6 S , where I is event intensity , M is mean image intensity and S the s . d . of image intensity . The center of each point - spread function was then calculated by ﬁ tting to a two - dimensional Gaussian distribution . After correction for sample drift with immobile 200 nm gold ﬁ ducial markers ( BBInternational ) , the x – y particle coordinates of each molecule were stored in a table . Two - dimensional molecular coordinates were cropped into nonoverlapping regions of 3 μ m ×3 μ m in area . It is known that individual ﬂ uorophores , both in PALM can ‘ blink ’ , which results in multiple localizations of the same molecule . Therefore , we discard ‘ blinks ’ that are present within the same 100 nm circle region in more than ﬁ ve continuous frames or that reappear within 10 frames at this region . We used DBSCAN analysis 41 to identify individual clusters within the 3 μ m ×3 μ m regions . The DBSCAN method detects clusters using a propagative method , which links points belonging to the same cluster based on two parameters ; the minimum number of neighbors ε ( ε = 3 ) in the radius r ( r = 20 nm ) . The DBSCAN routine was implemented in MATLAB and subsequently coded in c + + and compiled in a MEX ﬁ le ( Matlab executable ﬁ le ) to improve the speed of processing as we were working with large data ﬁ les .
