insight review articles 268 NATURE | VOL 410 | 8 MARCH 2001 | www . nature . com N etworks are on our minds nowadays . Sometimes we fear their power — and with good reason . On 10 August 1996 , a fault in two power lines in Oregon led , through a cascading series of failures , to blackouts in 11 US states and two Canadian provinces , leaving about 7 million customers without power for up to 16 hours 1 . The Love Bug worm , the worst computer attack to date , spread over the Internet on 4 May 2000 and inflicted billions of dollars of damage worldwide . In our lighter moments we play parlour games about connectivity . ‘Six degrees of Marlon Brando’ broke out as a nationwide fad in Germany , as readers of Die Zeit tried to connect a falafel vendor in Berlin with his favourite actor through the shortest possible chain of acquaintances 2 . And during the height of the Lewinsky scandal , the New York Times printed a diagram 3 of the famous people within ‘six degrees of Monica’ . Meanwhile scientists have been thinking about networks too . Empirical studies have shed light on the topology of food webs 4 , 5 , electrical power grids , cellular and metabolic networks 6 – 9 , the World - Wide Web 10 , the Internet backbone 11 , the neural network of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans 12 , telephone call graphs 13 , coauthor - ship and citation networks of scientists 14 – 16 , and the quintessential ‘old - boy’ network , the overlapping boards of directors of the largest companies in the United States 17 ( Fig . 1 ) . These databases are now easily accessible , courtesy of the Internet . Moreover , the availability of powerful computers has made it feasible to probe their structure ; until recently , computations involving million - node networks would have been impossible without specialized facilities . Why is network anatomy so important to characterize ? Because structure always affects function . For instance , the topology of social networks affects the spread of informa - tion and disease , and the topology of the power grid affects the robustness and stability of power transmission . From this perspective , the current interest in networks is part of a broader movement towards research on complex systems . In the words of E . O . Wilson 18 , “The greatest challenge today , not just in cell biology and ecology but in all of science , is the accurate and complete description of complex systems . Scientists have broken down many kinds of systems . They think they know most of the elements and forces . The next task is to reassemble them , at least in mathematical models that capture the key properties of the entire ensembles . ” But networks are inherently difficult to understand , as the following list of possible complications illustrates . 1 . Structural complexity : the wiring diagram could be an intricate tangle ( Fig . 1 ) . 2 . Network evolution : the wiring diagram could change over time . On the World - Wide Web , pages and links are created and lost every minute . 3 . Connection diversity : the links between nodes could have different weights , directions and signs . Synapses in Exploring complex networks Steven H . Strogatz Department of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and Center for Applied Mathematics , 212 Kimball Hall , Cornell University , Ithaca , New York 14853 - 1503 , USA ( e - mail : strogatz @ cornell . edu ) The study of networks pervades all of science , from neurobiology to statistical physics . The most basic issues are structural : how does one characterize the wiring diagram of a food web or the Internet or the metabolic network of the bacterium Escherichia coli ? Are there any unifying principles underlying their topology ? From the perspective of nonlinear dynamics , we would also like to understand how an enormous network of interacting dynamical systems — be they neurons , power stations or lasers — will behave collectively , given their individual dynamics and coupling architecture . Researchers are only now beginning to unravel the structure and dynamics of complex networks . Dynamical systems can often be modelled by differential equations d x / d t ! v ( x ) , where x ( t ) ! ( x 1 ( t ) , … , x n ( t ) ) is a vector of state variables , t is time , and v ( x ) ! ( v 1 ( x ) , … , v n ( x ) ) is a vector of functions that encode the dynamics . For example , in a chemical reaction , the state variables represent concentrations . The differential equations represent the kinetic rate laws , which usually involve nonlinear functions of the concentrations . Such nonlinear equations are typically impossible to solve analytically , but one can gain qualitative insight by imagining an abstract n - dimensional state space with axes x 1 , … , x n . As the system evolves , x ( t ) flows through state space , guided by the ‘velocity’ field d x / d t ! v ( x ) like a speck carried along in a steady , viscous fluid . Suppose x ( t ) eventually comes to rest at some point x * . Then the velocity must be zero there , so we call x * a fixed point . It corresponds to an equilibrium state of the physical system being modelled . If all small disturbances away from x * damp out , x * is called a stable fixed point — it acts as an attractor for states in its vicinity . Another long - term possibility is that x ( t ) flows towards a closed loop and eventually circulates around it forever . Such a loop is called a limit cycle . It represents a self - sustained oscillation of the physical system . A third possibility is that x ( t ) might settle onto a strange attractor , a set of states on which it wanders forever , never stopping or repeating . Such erratic , aperiodic motion is considered chaotic if two nearby states flow away from each other exponentially fast . Long - term prediction is impossible in a real chaotic system because of this exponential amplification of small uncertainties or measurement errors Box 1 Nonlinear dynamics : terminology and concepts 97 © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd the nervous system can be strong or weak , inhibitory or excitatory . 4 . Dynamical complexity : the nodes could be nonlinear dynamical systems . In a gene network or a Josephson junction array , the state of each node can vary in time in complicated ways . 5 . Node diversity : there could be many different kinds of nodes . The biochemical network that controls cell division in mammals consists of a bewildering variety of substrates and enzymes 6 , only a few of which are shown in Fig . 1c . 6 . Meta - complication : the various complications can influence each other . For example , the present layout of a power grid depends on how it has grown over the years — a case where network evolution ( 2 ) affects topology ( 1 ) . When coupled neurons fire together repeatedly , the connection between them is strengthened ; this is the basis of memory and learning . Here nodal dynamics ( 4 ) affect connection weights ( 3 ) . To make progress , different fields have suppressed certain complications while highlighting others . For instance , in nonlinear dynamics we have tended to favour simple , nearly identical dynamical systems coupled together in simple , geometrically regular ways . Furthermore we usually assume that the network architecture is static . These simplifications allow us to sidestep any issues of structural complexity and to concentrate instead on the system’s potentially formidable dynamics . Laser arrays provide a concrete example 19 – 24 . In the single - mode approximation , each laser is characterized by its time - dependent gain , polarization , and the phase and amplitude of its electric field . These evolve according to four coupled , nonlinear differential equations . We usually hope the laser will settle down to a stable state , corresponding to steady emission of light , but periodic pulsations and even chaotic intensity fluctuations can occur in some cases 19 . Now suppose that many identical lasers are arranged side by side in a regular chain 20 or ring 21 , interacting with their neighbours by evanes - cent coupling or by overlap of their electric fields 22 . Will the lasers lock their phases together spontaneously , or break up into a standing wave pattern , or beat each other into incoherence ? From a technolog - ical standpoint , self - synchronization would be the most desirable outcome , because a perfectly coherent array of N lasers would insight review articles NATURE | VOL 410 | 8 MARCH 2001 | www . nature . com 269 Replication Skp1 CBF3 primasep68Pol α P PCNA RPA cycE p27 P cycD P T286 cdk4 / 6 P P p16 cycA cycB cdk1 P T14Y15 p21 cdc25A P P T380 cdk2 P cdc25C P S216 C - TAK1 Chk1 Wee1 P P T161 Myt1 P Y15 Skp2 14 - 3 - 3 Cyclin box DMP1 P Cks1 P C1 C2 C2 C3 C4 C5 p57 C7 C6 C8 C9 C10 C11 C12 C13 C15 C16 C17 C18 C19 C20 C21 C22 C23 C24 C25 P S76 C28 C29 S9 Gadd45 C30 CycH Cdk7 P p53 Mdm2 P R2 P C26 R1 C14 p53 box P C32 C34 C35 Myc : Max C36 SL1 P SL1 C37 C38 C39 C40 APC P Plk1 C37 C41 C41 C41 P26 R11 R6 C11a C11b p19ARF P42 cyclins , pol α p19ARF D M P 1 E 2 F p53 F o s E20 C31 PCNA C27 Transcription C42 C42 ?

But in practice , semiconductor laser arrays are notoriously prone to both spatial and temporal instabilities 20 , 21 . Even for a simple ring geometry , this problem is dynamically complex . The first part of this article reviews what is known about dynami - cal complexity in regular networks of nonlinear systems . I offer a few rules of thumb about the impact of network structure on collective dynamics , especially for arrays of coupled limit - cycle oscillators . The logical next step would be to tackle networks that combine dynamical and structural complexity , such as power grids or ecological webs . Unfortunately they lie beyond our mathematical reach — we do not even know how to characterize their wiring diagrams . So we have to begin with network topology . By a happy coincidence , such architectural questions are being pursued in other branches of science , thanks to the excitement about the Internet , functional genomics , financial networks , and so on . The second part of this article uses graph theory to explore the structure of complex networks , an approach that has recently led to some encouraging progress , especially when combined with the tools of statistical mechanics and computer simulations . Needless to say , many other topics within network science deserve coverage here . The subject is amazingly rich , and apologies are offered to those readers whose favourite topics are omitted . Regular networks of coupled dynamical systems Networks of dynamical systems have been used to model everything from earthquakes to ecosystems , neurons to neutrinos 25 – 32 . To impose some order on this list , consider the dynamics that each node would exhibit if it were isolated . Assuming it is a generic dynamical system , its long - term behaviour is given by stable fixed points , limit cycles or chaotic attractors ( Box 1 ) . If we now couple many such systems together , what can be said about their collective behaviour ? The answer is not much — the details matter . But I will propose some rough generalizations anyway . If the dynamical system at each node has stable fixed points and no other attractors , the network tends to lock into a static pattern . Many such patterns may coexist , especially if the nodes have competing interactions . In that case the network may become frustrated and display enormous numbers of locally stable equilibria . This kind of complex static behaviour is seen in models of spin glasses , associative memory neural networks and combinatorial optimization problems 33 . At the opposite extreme , suppose each node has a chaotic attractor . Few rules have emerged about the effect of coupling architecture on dynamics in this case . It is known that networks of identical chaotic systems can synchronize their erratic fluctuations , a curious phenomenon with possible applications to private commu - nications 34 , 35 . For a wide range of network topologies , synchronized chaos requires that the coupling be neither too weak nor too strong ; otherwise spatial instabilities are triggered 34 . Related lines of research deal with networks of identical chaotic maps , lattice dynamical systems and cellular automata . These systems have been used mainly as testbeds for exploring spatiotemporal chaos and pattern formation in the simplest mathematical settings , rather than as models of real physical systems . Identical oscillators The intermediate case where each node has a stable limit cycle has turned out to be particularly fruitful . Much of the research has been inspired by biological examples , ranging from the mutual synchronization of cardiac pacemaker cells , to rhythmically flashing fireflies and chorusing crickets , to wave propagation in the heart , brain , intestine and nervous system 25 . Arrays of identical oscillators often synchronize , or else form pat - terns that depend on the symmetry of the underlying network 36 . Other common modes of organization are travelling waves in one spatial dimension , rotating spirals in two dimensions and scroll waves in three dimensions 25 , 26 . For fully connected networks where each node is coupled equally to all the others , the completely synchronized state becomes likely . These heuristics apply to systems coupled by smooth interactions akin to diffusion . But many biological oscillators communicate by sudden impulses : a neuron fires , a firefly flashes , a cricket chirps . Hence the recent interest in pulse - coupled oscillators 37 . This thread began with Peskin’s model of the sinoatrial node , the heart’s natural pacemaker , as a collection of N identical integrate - and - fire oscilla - tors 38 . For the simple case where each oscillator is connected to all the others , Peskin conjectured that they would all end up firing in unison , no matter how they started . He gave a proof for N ! 2 oscillators ; it was later demonstrated 39 that the conjecture holds for all N . Peskin also conjectured that synchronization would occur even if the oscillators were not quite identical , but that problem remains unproven . Peskin’s model has been used as a caricature of coupled neu - rons 40 – 42 by including synaptic delays , refractory periods , inhibition and local coupling ; these realistic features also remove some of the undesirable discontinuities in the mathematics . In an example of scientific cross - fertilization , Hopfield 43 pointed out that the locally coupled version of the model is closely related to slider - block models of earthquakes and should therefore display self - organized criticali - ty . That observation suggested intriguing links among neurobiology , geophysics , synchronization and self - organized criticality , and sparked a burst of research activity , as reviewed in ref . 37 . Non - identical oscillators While modelling populations of biological oscillators , Winfree discovered a new kind of cooperative phenomenon , the temporal 270 NATURE | VOL 410 | 8 MARCH 2001 | www . nature . com insight review articles Figure 2 Spontaneous synchronization in a network of limit - cycle oscillators with distributed natural frequencies . The state of each oscillator is represented geometrically as a dot in the complex plane . The amplitude and phase of the oscillation correspond to the radius and angle of the dot in polar coordinates . Colours code the oscillators’ natural frequencies , running from slowest ( red ) to fastest ( violet ) . In the absence of coupling , each oscillator would settle onto its limit cycle ( circle ) and rotate at its natural frequency . However , here all the oscillators are also pulled towards the mean field that they generate collectively ( shown as an asterisk at the centre of the population ) . Time increases from left to right , and from top to bottom . Starting from a random initial condition , the oscillators self - organize by collapsing their amplitudes ; then they sort their phases so that the fastest oscillators are in the lead . Ultimately they all rotate as a synchronized pack , with locked amplitudes and phases . The governing equations describe a mean - field model of a laser array 23 . ( Simulation provided by R . Oliva . ) © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd analogue of a phase transition 44 . He proposed a mean - field model of nearly identical , weakly coupled limit - cycle oscillators and showed that when the coupling is small compared to the spread of natural frequencies , the system behaves incoherently , with each oscillator running at its natural frequency . As the coupling is increased , the incoherence persists until a certain threshold is crossed — then a small cluster of oscillators suddenly ‘freezes’ into synchrony . For still greater coupling , all the oscillators become locked in phase and amplitude ( Fig . 2 ) . Kuramoto 26 refined this connection between nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics . He proposed an exactly solvable model of collective synchronization , given by ! d d " t i ! ! # i $ ! N K ! !

In other words , the oscillators are desynchronized completely until the coupling strength K exceeds a critical value K c . After that , the population splits into a partially synchronized state insight review articles NATURE | VOL 410 | 8 MARCH 2001 | www . nature . com 271 b a c d Figure 3 Schematic illustration of regular and random network architectures . a , Ring of ten nodes connected to their nearest neighbours . b , Fully connected network of ten nodes . c , Random graph constructed by placing nnodes on a plane , then joining pairs of them together at random until mlinks are used . Nodes may be chosen more than once , or not at all . The resulting wiring diagram ( not shown ) would be a snarl of criss - crossed lines ; to clarify it , I have segregated the different connected components , coloured them , and eliminated as many spurious crossings as possible . The main topological features are the presence of a single giant component , as expected 51 – 53 for a random graph with m > n / 2 ( here n ! 200 , m ! 193 ) , and the absence of any dominant hubs . The degree , or number of neighbours , is Poisson distributed across the nodes ; most nodes have between one and four neighbours , and all have between zero and six . d , Scale - free graph , grown by attaching new nodes at random to previously existing nodes . The probability of attachment is proportional to the degree of the target node ; thus richly connected nodes tend to get richer , leading to the formation of hubs and a skewed degree distribution with a heavy tail .

Figure 4 Solvable model of a small - world network . The model starts with a ring lattice of nnodes , each connected to its neighbours out to some range k ( here n ! 24 and k ! 3 ) . Shortcut links are added between random pairs of nodes , with probability * per link on the underlying lattice . In the limit n " 1 , the average path length between nodes can be approximated analytically . ( Adapted from ref . 75 . ) © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd consisting of two groups of oscillators : a synchronized group that contributes to the order parameter r , and a desynchronized group whose natural frequencies lie in the tails of the distribution g ( # ) and are too extreme to be entrained . With further increases in K , more and more oscillators are recruited into the synchronized group , and r grows accordingly . Twenty - five years later , the Kuramoto model continues to sur - prise us ( see ref . 45 for a review ) . First , the incoherent state with r ! 0 was found to be neutrally stable below threshold , despite its apparent stability in simulations ; the analysis reveals a connection to Landau damping in plasmas . Second , the square - root critical behaviour of r , almost a cliché for mean - field models in statistical mechanics , turns out to be non - generic ; if the sinusoidal coupling is replaced by a periodic function with second harmonics , the scaling changes to r ~ K % K c . Third , although the model was motivated originally by biological oscillators , it has appeared in such far - flung settings as the flavour evolution of neutrinos 32 , and arrays of Josephson junctions 27 and semiconductor lasers 24 . The main unsolved problem is the stability of the partially synchronized state for K > K c . Numerical simulations indicate that it is globally stable , in the sense that it attracts almost all solutions , but even the linear stability problem has yet to be solved . Another issue concerns the extension of the model to nearest - neighbour coupling on a d - dimensional cubic lattice . Simulations 46 and renormalization arguments 47 indicate that the synchronization phase transition persists for d ) 3 and vanishes for d ! 1 ; the results are ambiguous for d ! 2 . All of this awaits a mathematical resolution . In contrast to the mean - field models of Winfree and Kuramoto , Ermentrout and Kopell’s classic work deals with one - dimensional chains of oscillators , first in connection with neuromuscular rhythms in the mammalian intestine 48 , and later in their model of the central pattern generator for the lamprey eel 49 , 50 . The main phenomena here involve travelling waves , rather than the synchrony found in mean - field models . This is not accidental , as wave propagation is essential for the generation of peristalsis in the intestine , and for the creation of the swimming rhythm in lamprey . Ermentrout and Kopell introduced several deep mathematical innovations , but perhaps their most impressive result is a counterin - tuitive biological prediction . Their lamprey model suggested that the tail - to - head neural connections along the spinal cord would be stronger than those running from head to tail , despite the fact that the wave associated with swimming travels from head to tail . To everyone’s delight , that prediction was later confirmed by their experimental collaborators 50 . Complex network architectures All the network topologies discussed so far — chains , grids , lattices and fully - connected graphs — have been completely regular ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Those simple architectures allowed us to focus on the complexity caused by the nonlinear dynamics of the nodes , without being burdened by any additional complexity in the network structure itself . Now I take the complementary approach , setting dynamics aside and turning to more complex architectures . A natural place to start is at the opposite end of the spectrum from regular networks , with graphs that are completely random . Random graphs Imagine n " 1 buttons strewn across the floor 51 . Pick two buttons at random and tie them together with thread . Repeat this process m times , always choosing pairs of buttons at random . ( If m is large , you might eventually select buttons that already have threads attached . That is certainly allowed ; it merely creates clusters of connected buttons . ) The result is a physical example of a random graph with n nodes and m links ( Fig . 3c ) . Now slowly lift a random button off the floor . If it is tied to other buttons , either directly or indirectly , those are dragged up too . So what happens ? Are you likely to pull up an isolated button , a small cluster or a vast meshwork ? Erdös and Rényi 52 studied how the expected topology of this random graph changes as a function of m . When m is small , the graph is likely to be fragmented into many small clusters of nodes , called components . As m increases , the components grow , at first by linking to isolated nodes and later by coalescing with other components . A phase transition occurs at m ! n / 2 , where many clusters crosslink spontaneously to form a single giant component . For m > n / 2 , this giant component contains on the order of n nodes ( more precisely , its size scales linearly with n , as n → ( ) , while its closest rival contains only about log n nodes . Furthermore , all nodes in the giant component are connected to each other by short paths : the maximum number of ‘degrees of separation’ between any two nodes grows slowly , like log n . In the decades since this pioneering work , random graphs have been studied deeply within pure mathematics 53 . They have also served as idealized coupling architectures for dynamical models of gene networks , ecosystems and the spread of infectious diseases and computer viruses 29 , 51 , 54 , 55 . Small - world networks Although regular networks and random graphs are both useful ideal - izations , many real networks lie somewhere between the extremes of order and randomness .

Movie actors : 449 , 913 actors linked by mutual appearances in 151 , 261 feature films , as specified by the Internet Movie Database ( www . imdb . com ) as of 1 May 2000 . Biomedical collaborations : 1 , 388 , 989 scientists linked by coauthorship of at least one of 2 , 156 , 769 biomedical journal articles published between 1995 and 1999 inclusive , as listed in the MEDLINE database . The clustering coefficient C is defined as the probability that a connected triple of nodes is actually a triangle ; here nodes correspond to people , as in the unipartite representation shown in Fig . 7b . Intuitively , C measures the likelihood that two people who have a mutual collaborator are also collaborators of each other . The results show that the random model accurately predicts C for the corporate director network , given the network’s bipartite structure and its degree distributions ; no additional social forces need to be invoked . For the networks of actors and scientists , the model accounts for about half of the observed clustering . The remaining portion depends on social mechanisms at work in these communities ( see text ) . ( Adapted from ref . 91 . ) © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd where the original links are replaced by random ones with some probability 0 + * + 1 . They found that the slightest bit of rewiring transforms the network into a ‘small world’ , with short paths between any two nodes , just as in the giant component of a random graph . Yet the network is much more highly clustered than a random graph , in the sense that if A is linked to B and B is linked to C , there is a greatly increased probability that A will also be linked to C ( a property that sociologists 58 call ‘transitivity’ ) . Watts and Strogatz conjectured that the same two properties — short paths and high clustering — would hold also for many natural and technological networks . Furthermore , they conjectured that dynamical systems coupled in this way would display enhanced signal propagation speed , synchronizability and computational power , as compared with regular lattices of the same size . The intuition is that the short paths could provide high - speed communication channels between distant parts of the system , thereby facilitating any dynamical process ( like synchronization or computa - tion ) that requires global coordination and information flow . Research has proceeded along several fronts . Many empirical examples of small - world networks have been documented , in fields ranging from cell biology to business 9 , 14 , 59 – 64 . On the theoretical side , small - world networks are turning out to be a Rorschach test — different scientists see different problems here , depending on their disciplines . Computer scientists see questions about algorithms and their complexity . Walsh 65 showed that graphs associated with many diffi - cult search problems have a small - world topology . Kleinberg 66 introduced an elegant model of the algorithmic challenge posed by Milgram’s original sociological experiment 67 — how to actually find a short chain of acquaintances linking yourself to a random target person , using only local information — and he proved that the problem is easily solvable for some kinds of small worlds , and essentially intractable for others . Epidemiologists have asked how local clustering and global contacts together influence the spread of infectious disease , with implications for vaccination strategies and the evolution of virulence 68 – 71 . Neurobiologists have wondered about the possible evolutionary significance of small - world neural architecture . They have argued that this kind of topology combines fast signal processing with coherent oscillations 72 , unlike either regular or random architectures , and that it may be selected by adaptation to rich sensory environments and motor demands 64 . Perhaps the strongest response to the Rorschach test comes from the statistical physicists , who sensed immediately 73 that the toy model of Watts and Strogatz 56 would yield to their techniques ( see ref . 74 for a review ) . In its improved form the model starts with a ring of n nodes , each connected by undirected links to its nearest and next - nearest neighbours out to some range k . Shortcut links are then added — rather than rewired — between randomly selected pairs of nodes , with probability * per link on the underlying lattice ; thus there are typically nk * shortcuts in the graph ( Fig . 4 ) . The question is : on average , how many steps are required to go from one node to another along the shortest route ? If ! denotes that average separation , we find that ! drops sharply near * ! 0 , confirming that a few shortcuts do indeed shrink the world dramatically . One of the most striking results is the following formula derived by Newman , Moore and Watts 75 : ! ! ! n k ! f ( nk * ) where f ( x ) ! ! 2 $ x 1 2 $ 2 x % ! tanh % 1 ! $ x 2 x $ 2 x % ! This solution is asymptotically exact in the limits n → ( ( large system size ) and either nk * → ( or nk * → 0 ( large or small number of insight review articles NATURE | VOL 410 | 8 MARCH 2001 | www . nature . com 273 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 Indegree 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 10 8 F r e q u e n c y 1 10 100 Number of coauthors 0 5 10 15 20 Transmission lines 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 C u m u l a t i v e p r o b a b ili t y 0 100 200 300 Acquaintances 10 1 10 0 a b c d Figure 6 Degree distributions for real networks . a , World - Wide Web .

The negative derivative of this cumulative distribution is the degree distribution , also an exponential . ( Adapted from ref . 62 . ) d , Social network . Nodes are 43 Mormons in Utah ; undirected links represent acquaintances with other Mormons 79 . The linear – log plot of the cumulative distribution is well fit by an error function ( solid line ) , so the degree distribution is a gaussian . ( Adapted from ref . 62 . ) © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd shortcuts ) . Figure 5 shows that it also gives the correct qualitative behaviour for nk * ≈ 1 . Barbour and Reinert 76 improved this result by proving a rigorous distributional approximation for ! , along with a bound on the error . Scale - free networks In any real network , some nodes are more highly connected than others are . To quantify this effect , let p k denote the fraction of nodes that have k links . Here k is called the degree and p k is the degree distribution . The simplest random graph models 52 , 53 predict a bell - shaped Poisson distribution for p k . But for many real networks , p k is highly skewed and decays much more slowly than a Poisson . For instance , the distribution decays as a power law p k ~ k % ’ for the Internet backbone 11 , metabolic reaction networks 9 , the telephone call graph 13 and the World - Wide Web 10 ( Fig . 6a ) . Remarkably , the exponent ’ ≈ 2 . 1 – 2 . 4 for all of these cases . Taken literally , this form of heavy - tailed distribution would imply an infinite variance . In reality , there are a few nodes with many links ( Fig . 3d ) . For the World - Wide Web , think Yahoo ; for metabolic networks , think ATP . Barabási , Albert and Jeong 77 , 78 have dubbed these networks ‘scale - free’ , by analogy with fractals , phase transitions and other situations where power laws arise and no single characteristic scale can be defined . The scale - free property is common but not universal 62 . For coauthorship networks of scientists , p k is fit better by a power law with an exponential cutoff 14 ( Fig . 6b ) ; for the power grid of the western United States , p k is an exponential distribution 62 ( Fig . 6c ) ; and for a social network of Mormons in Utah 79 , p k is gaussian 62 ( Fig . 6d ) . Nevertheless , the scale - free case has stimulated a great deal of theorizing . The earliest work is due to Simon 80 , 81 in 1955 , now independently rediscovered by Barabási , Albert and Jeong 77 , 78 . They showed that a heavy - tailed degree distribution emerges automatical - ly from a stochastic growth model in which new nodes are added continuously and attach themselves preferentially to existing nodes , with probability proportional to the degree of the target node . Richly connected nodes get richer , and the result is p k ~ k % 3 . More sophisticated models 82 – 84 include the effects of adding or rewiring links , allowing nodes to age so that they can no longer accept new links , or varying the form of preferential attachment . These general - ized models predict exponential and truncated power - law p k in some parameter regimes , as well as scale - free distributions . Could there be a functional advantage to scale - free architecture ? Albert , Jeong and Barabási 85 suggested that scale - free networks are resistant to random failures because a few hubs dominate their topology ( Fig . 3d ) . Any node that fails probably has small degree ( like most nodes ) and so is expendable . The flip side is that such networks are vulnerable to deliberate attacks on the hubs . These intuitive ideas have been confirmed numerically 10 , 85 and analytically 86 , 87 by examining how the average path length and size of the giant component depend on the number and degree of the nodes removed . Some possible implications for the resilience of the Internet 79 – 81 , the design of therapeutic drugs 9 , and the evolution of metabolic networks 9 , 59 have been discussed . Generalized random graphs As mentioned above , the simplest random graph predicts a Poisson degree distribution , and so cannot accommodate the other types of distribution found in real networks . Molloy and Reed 88 , 89 introduced a more flexible class of random graphs in which any degree distribu - tion is permitted . Given a sequence of non - negative integers { d k } , where d k denotes the number of nodes with degree k , consider the ensemble of all graphs with that prescribed degree sequence , and weight them all equally when computing statistical averages of interest . For this class of graphs , Molloy and Reed derived a simple condition for the birth of the giant component 88 , and they also found an implicit formula for its size as a fraction of n , the total number of nodes 89 . Specifically , let n " 1 and define Q ! ! ( k ! 1 p k k ( k % 2 ) where p k ! d k / n . If Q < 0 , the graph consists of many small compo - nents . The average component size diverges as Q → 0 from below , and a giant component exists for Q > 0 . ( In technical terms , these results hold ‘almost surely’ ; that is , with probability tending to 1 as n → ( . ) Aiello , Chung and Lu 90 applied these results to a random graph model for scale - free networks . For p k of power - law form , the condition on Q implies that a giant component exists if and only if ’ < 3 . 47 , which holds for most scale - free networks measured so far . If ’ < 1 , there are so many high - degree hubs that the network forms one huge , connected piece . They also proved theorems about the number and size of small components outside the giant component , and compared these to a real graph of about 47 million telephone numbers and the calls between them in one day . They found that the data are best fit by an exponent ’ ≈ 2 . 1 , which predicts correctly that the call graph is not connected but has a giant component . The papers by Molloy and Reed 88 , 89 and Aiello et al . 90 are mathematically rigorous . Newman , Strogatz and Watts 91 recently developed a more heuristic approach based on generating functions . By handling the limit n → ( in an intuitive way , their approach yields elementary derivations of the earlier results , along with new exact results for graphs with additional structure , such as directed or bipartite graphs . insight review articles 274 NATURE | VOL 410 | 8 MARCH 2001 | www . nature . com M = 4 N = 11 D E F G H I J K 1 2 3 4 C B B D A C E F G H I J K A a b Figure 7 Bipartite versus unipartite representations of the corporate director network . a , In the bipartite approach , directors and boards are treated as distinct kinds of nodes . The schematic example shows 11 directors and 4 boards . Links indicate which people sit on which boards . By definition there are no links between pairs of people , or between pairs of boards . b , The more familiar unipartite representation depicts the people as nodes , with links between those on the same board , forming cliques . This approach discards important information and can conflate different structures . For example , the triangle FHI corresponds to board number 3 , as seen in a , whereas the similar - looking triangle FGI does not correspond to any single board . Another confusing effect is the large number of cliques that occur automatically in this projection of the full bipartite graph . Such cliques account for much of the high clustering observed in real affiliation networks 58 . The random graph model teases out this generic source of clustering from that indicative of more interesting social interactions . ( Adapted from ref . 91 . ) © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd The bipartite case is especially interesting for applications 58 . By definition , in a bipartite graph there are two types of nodes , with links running only between different kinds ( Fig . 7 ) . For example , consider the network of the boards of directors of the Fortune 1 , 000 compa - nies , the largest US corporations ranked according to revenues . This network is fascinating because the boards ‘interlock’ — some impor - tant people sit on several of them — and this overlap knits virtually all large US firms together into a giant web of corporate governance 17 . Let p j denote the probability that a director sits on exactly j boards , and let q k denote the probability that a board consists of k directors . Figure 8 shows that p j is approximately exponential , with most directors sitting on only one board , whereas q k is strongly peaked around k ! 10 , indicating that most boards have about ten members . As a null hypothesis , assume that the Fortune 1 , 000 network is a random member of the ensemble of all bipartite graphs with the same p j and q k . Then generating functions yield predictions for various quantities of interest 91 . For example , suppose we want to calculate r z , the probability that a random director works with a total of z other co - directors , summed over all the boards on which he or she serves . Let f 0 ( x ) ! ! ( j ! 0 p j x j g 0 ( x ) ! ! ( k ! 0 q k x k be the generating functions associated with the empirical degree distributions p j and q k . If we now choose a random edge on the bipar - tite graph and follow it to the board at one of its ends , the distribution of the number of other edges leaving that board can be shown to be generated by g 1 ( x ) ! g 0 , ( x ) / - , where - ! g 0 , ( 1 ) . Then for a randomly chosen director , the generating function for z is given by G 0 ( x ) ! f 0 ( g 1 ( x ) ) . If we expand G 0 in a series as G 0 ( x ) ! ! ( z ! 0 r z x z , the coefficients r z are exactly the quantities we seek . They can be extracted by repeated differentiation : r z ! ( 1 / z ! ) ( d z G 0 / d x z ) . x ! 0 . Figure 8c shows that the predicted r z agrees almost perfectly with the actual distribution . Similarly , the clustering coefficient 56 predicted for the directors lies within 1 % of the observed value ( Table 1 ) . Clearly the random model captures much of the structure of the real network . However , for two other bipartite graphs — film actors and the movies they appeared in , and biomedical scientists and the papers they coauthored — the model 91 underestimates the clustering coefficients by half ( Table 1 ) . The reason is that the random model quantifies only the generic portion of the clustering ; it reflects the cliques that are formed automatically whenever a bipartite collabora - tion graph is projected onto the space of people , as in Fig . 7b . For the corporate board data , those cliques account for essentially all the clustering ( simply because most directors sit on only one board , thus preventing clustering across boards ) . But for the scientists and actors , some further mechanisms must be at work . One possible explanation is that scientists tend to introduce pairs of their collaborators to each other , engendering new collaborations . In this way the random model allows us to disentangle the generic features of bipartite graphs from those that could reflect sociological effects . Beyond their benchmarking role , generalized random graphs provide a promising new class of substrates on which dynamical processes can be simulated and even approached analytically . Using this approach , Watts 92 has given an intriguing explanation of fads and normal accidents as the natural consequence of cascade dynamics on sparse interaction networks . Outlook In the short run there are plenty of good problems about the nonlin - ear dynamics of systems coupled according to small - world , scale - free or generalized random connectivity . The speculations that these architectures are dynamically advantageous ( for example , more syn - chronizable or error - tolerant ) need to be sharpened , then confirmed or refuted mathematically for specific examples . Other ripe topics include the design of self - healing networks , and the relationships among optimization principles , network growth rules and network topology 82 – 84 , 93 – 96 . In the longer run , network thinking will become essential to all branches of science as we struggle to interpret the data pouring in from neurobiology , genomics , ecology , finance and the World - Wide Web . Will theory be able to keep up ? Time to log back on to the Internet . . . ■■ 1 . Western Systems Coordinating Council ( WSCC ) .

The data shown here comprise 7 , 673 directors and 914 boards . Most directors serve on the board of only one company , but about 20 % sit on two or more boards , thereby creating interlocked directorates . This has potentially important consequences for business practices in the United States 17 . a , Distribution of the number of boards per director .
