The actin - binding ability of cofilin is inhibited by inositol phosphates ( PIP 2 ) , and the PIP 2 - and actin - binding site ( s ) has been localized in residues W 104 – M 115 of the cofilin primary sequence ( Yonezawa et al . 1991 ) . In the present study , in order to further clarify the functional domains in cofilin molecule , we constructed expression vectors containing cDNAs of different size with deletion at the 3 ¢ - region of the open reading frame . The truncated cofilin molecules produced in E . coli were purified and examined for their actin - binding and PIP 2 - binding ability . We found that the truncated cofilin molecule without C - terminal residues # 100 – # 166 including the previously - described actin - binding site could be cross - linked with actin by EDC , a zero - length cross - linker . In addition , these truncated peptides as well as synthetic peptides corresponding to the N - terminal sequence of cofilin suppressed the inhibitory action of PIP 2 on actin - cofilin interaction . These results strongly suggest that additional actin - and PIP 2 - binding sites exist in the N - terminal region of cofilin .

Actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) with a slightly smaller size is also known to have a similar function [ 2 ] . The two proteins have been categorized in the same protein family , the cofilin / ADF family , because of their high sequence homology , [ 3 – 5 ] and functional similarity [ 1 , 6 , 7 ] . Proteins of this family have been detected in both muscle and non - muscle cells of a variety of eukaryotes ( for review , see [ 8 ] ) and recently considerable information has accumulated regarding their possibly essential role for the structure and function of actin organization ; for example , mutations that inactivate the cofilin / ADF genes in Drosophila melanogaster [ 9 ] , Caenorhabditis elegans [ 10 ] , and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 11 , 12 ] severely damage their viability . Cofilin seems to be deeply involved in actin dynamics during cytokinesis , since it is accumulated in the contractile ring [ 13 , 14 ] . This protein is also important as a regulator for reorganization of actin in developing and degenerating muscle cells [ 15 – 17 ] . It has been demonstrated that the activity of cofilin can be regulated in several ways . For example , cofilin remains associated with F - actin at neutral pH but disassembles F - actin rapidly into G - actin at alkaline pH [ 1 , 18 ] . Further , phosphoinositides , especially PIP 2 , have been considered as a suppresser of cofilin activity [ 17 , 19 ] . Phosphorylation is Address for offprints : T .

In the oocytes of Xenopus laevis , almost 100 % of Xenopus ADF / cofilin ( XAC ) is phosphorylated , but more than 60 % of the protein is dephosphorylated within 30 min after fertilization [ 13 ] . The phosphorylated form of cofilin is free from actin filament in vivo and lacks binding ability to actin in vitro [ 20 ] . Biochemical analyses revealed that phosphorylated ADF neither binds to G - actin nor affects the rate or extent of actin assembly , but removal of phosphate from phosphorylated ADF restores full activity to depolymerize F - actin [ 21 ] . The basic functional domains have been localized in the cofilin and ADF sequences ; that is , it was established that the sequence Trp 104 – Met 115 is responsible for actin - binding and that Lys 112 and Lys 114 in this sequence are crucial for this [ 22 , 23 ] . The sequence Trp 104 – Met 115 is also known to interact with phosphoinositides [ 23 ] . A stretch of basic amino acids , K 30 KRKK 34 , functions as a signal for heat shock - or dimethyl sulfoxide - induced nuclear translocation of cofilin [ 24 , 25 ] . The functional phosphorylation site of both ADF and cofilin was recently determined as Ser 3 in the N - terminal side [ 20 , 21 ] . In the primary structure , however , the phosphorylation site is considerably apart from the actin / phosphoinositides - binding site . In the present study , assuming that additional sequences involved in the interaction with actin might exist in a cofilin molecule to enable the complicated regulation of cofilin - actin interaction , we examined the sequence in the N - terminal side from a functional viewpoint . We report here that a sequence responsible for actin - binding and phospho - inositide - binding is present in the N - terminal side of cofilin , near the phosphorylation site . Materials and methods Construction of expression vectors Full - length chicken cofilin cDNA cloned into pBluescript IIKS + ( pCMC - 16 ) [ 3 ] was digested with Nco 1 and Bam H1 . The construct for expression of wild - type cofilin ( pET - 3d - COF ) was obtained by ligating the cDNA into pET - 3d vector linearized with Nco 1 and Bam H1 as described previously [ 17 ] . Four C - terminal truncated mutant cDNAs ( CDN - 66 , CDN - 110 , CDN - 116 , and CDN - 146 ) and an N - terminal truncated mutant cDNA ( CD66 - C ) of cofilin were created by using restriction enzymes and Klenow polymerase ( see Fig . 3 ) ; CMC - 16 was digested with Eco 471 for CDN - 66 and CDN - 146 , with Sau A1 for CDN - 116 , and with Dra 1 for CDN116 , and blunted with Klenow polymerase . The frag - ments were excised by digesting with Kpn 1 for insertion into the Ban 111 / Kpn 1 site of pBluescript IIKS + vector . The CDN - 110 was created by ligating the Dra l - Eco RV fragment of CMC - 16 into pBluescript IIKS + vector which had been digested and blunted with Xba 1 and Klenow polymerase . For CD66 - C , CMC - 16 was digested with Eco O1091 and blunted with Klenow polymerase . The fragment excised by subsequent digestion with Pst 1 was ligated into pCMC - 16 , the insert of which was removed by digestion with Pst 1 and Neo 1 , and the Nco 1 site was blunted with Klenow polymerase . The truncated cDNAs in pBluescript IIKS + vector were digested with Nco 1 and Bam H1 and ligated into the Nco 1 and Bam H1 sites of pET - 3d vector . The constructs were confirmed by sequencing and restriction enzyme mapping . Expression and purification of r - cofilin BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells transformed with expression con - structs were grown at 37°C in an LB medium containing 5 mg / ml of ampicillin . IPTG was added to a final con - centration of 0 . 5 mM , when OD 600 of the cell suspension reached 0 . 6 . Cells were harvested at 3 h post - induction by centrifugation at 10 , 000 g for 30 min . The cells were washed once with TEN solution ( 0 . 1 M NaCl , 20 mM EDTA , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) and resuspended in a solution composed of 10 % sucrose , 20 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and incubated for 30 min at 40°C . The cells were then lysed in a solution containing 5 % Triton X - 100 , 31 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF and 25 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 at 40°C . Wild type r - cofilin was purified by the method described previously [ 17 ] with slight modification . Briefly , the lysate was centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 1 h at 40°C and r - cofilin was precipitated from the supernatant with ammonium sulfate of 60 – 80 % saturation . The pellet was dissolved in a solution containing 0 . 2 M KCl , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , dialyzed against the same buffer at 40°C , and the protein solution was applied to a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with the same solution . r - cofilin was eluted with 0 . 6 M KCl - 10 mM K - phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 0 . The eluate was con - centrated with a YM3 membrane ( Amicon ) and subjected to a Sephadex G - 75 column equilibrated with 0 . 1 M KCl , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 . The fractions containing cofilin of high purity were collected by monitoring by SDS - PAGE . The purified r - cofilin was dialyzed against an assay buffer ( 0 . 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , 2 mM HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 0 ) . The protein was further purified by centrifugation at 130 , 000 g for 2 h at 40°C before use . The truncated r - cofilin became mostly insoluble by forming inclusion bodies when expressed in E . coli . Therefore , the bacterial cells were sonicated after being lysed as described above , and centrifuged at 20 , 000 g for 30 min at 40°C . The pellet was washed repeatedly with a solution containing 0 . 1 M NaCl , 2 % Triton X - 100 , 20 mM EDTA , and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , and then with a solution containing 50 mM KCl , 5 mM EDTA , 10 mM DTT , and 20 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 . The inclusion bodies were solubilized in a solution of 8 M urea ,
