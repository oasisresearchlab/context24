Increased Eps15 homology domain 1 and RAB11FIP3 expression regulate breast cancer progression via promoting epithelial growth factor receptor recycling Dandan Tong 1 , Ya - Nan Liang 1 , 2 , AA Stepanova 3 , Yu Liu 1 , Xiaobo Li 1 , Letian Wang 4 , Fengmin Zhang 1 and NV Vasilyeva 3 Abstract Recent research indicates that the C - terminal Eps15 homology domain 1 is associated with epithelial growth factor receptor – mediated endocytosis recycling in non - small - cell lung cancer . The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of Eps15 homology domain 1 gene expression in relation to phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression in patients with breast cancer . Primary breast cancer samples from 306 patients were analyzed for Eps15 homology domain 1 , RAB11FIP3 , and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression via immunohistochemistry . The clinical significance was assessed via a multivariate Cox regression analysis , Kaplan – Meier curves , and the log - rank test . Eps15 homology domain 1 and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor were upregulated in 60 . 46 % ( 185 / 306 ) and 53 . 92 % ( 165 / 306 ) of tumor tissues , respectively , as assessed by immunohistochemistry . The statistical correlation analysis indicated that Eps15 homology domain 1 overexpression was positively correlated with the increases in phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor ( r = 0 . 242 , p < 0 . 001 ) and RAB11FIP3 ( r = 0 . 165 , p = 0 . 005 ) expression . The multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis demonstrated that the expression of Eps15 homology domain 1 alone is a significant prognostic marker of breast cancer for the overall survival in the total , chemotherapy , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( − ) groups . However , the use of combined expression of Eps15 homology domain 1 and phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor markers is more effective for the disease - free survival in the overall population , chemotherapy , and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( − ) groups . Moreover , the combined markers are also significant prognostic markers of breast cancer in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( + ) , estrogen receptor ( + ) , and estrogen receptor ( − ) groups . Eps15 homology domain 1 has a tumor suppressor function , and the combined marker of Eps15 homology domain 1 / phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor expression was identified as a better prognostic marker in breast cancer diagnosis . Furthermore , RAB11FIP3 combines with Eps15 homology domain 1 to promote the endocytosis recycling of phosphorylation of epithelial growth factor receptor .

It is activated by epithelial growth factor ( EGF ) and subse - quently induces tyrosine kinase activity in the intracel - lular domain by triggering dimerization ; the downstream signal transduction pathways are subsequently activated to complete the transmembrane signal transduction pro - cess . 5 – 8 EGFR signals , which enter cells , may arrive late lysosome and degradation , the termination of the signal transduction process , or through dephosphorylation , fol - lowed by endocytosis - recycling return to the plasma membrane for recycling . Many studies have demon - strated that EGFRs are increased in tumor tissues . However , it remains unclear whether this increase is a result of increased EGFR expression or an increased speed of return to the cell membrane via endocytosis recycling . EGFR - mediated endocytosis recycling is a highly organized transport process regulated by numerous pro - teins , including the Rab family of small guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) - binding proteins and the C - terminal Eps15 homology domain ( EHD ) - containing proteins . 7 , 9 – 16 The C - terminal EHD / receptor - mediated endocytosis ( RME ) - 1 family is a new type of endosomal scaffolding molecules . Many studies across species , which have examined the normal cells of plants , fruit flies , and mam - mals , have demonstrated that it adjusts the recycling of membrane cargo from endocytosis recycled vesicles ( ERC ) to the plasma membrane . 17 – 21 However , in tumors , EHD1 expression has only been demonstrated to be increased in lung cancer . 22 , 23 Rab proteins play major roles in vesicle budding , delivery , tethering , and fusion , and Rab11FIP3 abounds in the Rab11 - positive ERC . During interphase , FIP3 localizes to the ERC and maintains the structural integ - rity of the ERC . 15 , 16 , 24 , 25 During cell division , FIP3 par - ticipates in membrane delivery from the ERC to the site of membrane insertion . 15 , 25 – 27 The Rab11 GTPase effec - tor protein FIP3 interacts with a part of the motor pro - tein complex and subsequently drives membrane transport from the periphery sorting endosome to the central ERC . 28 In BC , whether Rab protein and EHD1 are involved in the regulation of endocytosis recycling , as well as the function of EHD1 and Rab11FIP3 , are unclear . This article will address these issues . Materials and methods Primary tumor specimens A total of 50 pairs of primary BC and adjacent non - tumor - ous tissues were collected by snap freezing immediately following surgical resection at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University ( Heilongjiang , China ) . The tissue samples used in this study were approved by The Hospital Ethics Committee for Ethical Review of Research Involving Human Subjects at Harbin Medical University ( Harbin , China ) . Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry Archives of paraffin blocks from 306 patients , including 50 adjacent normal tissues with female BC , were obtained from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University ( Heilongjiang , China ; age : 27 – 82 years , median age : 49 years ; operated on between January 2007 and December 2007 ) . None of the patients in this study had received radiation or chemotherapy prior to surgery . The tissue microarray ( TMA ) blocks were constructed according to a previously described method . BC TMAs used for immunohistochemical ( IHC ) were analyzed for this study based on the data from 306 tumor samples and 50 adjacent normal tissues . Primary cancers were evaluated in accordance with the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ) staging system ( tumor / node / metastasis ( TNM ) ) . Estrogen receptor ( ER ) - positive , progesterone receptor ( PR ) - positive , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) - positive , P53 - positive , and Ki67 - positive patients were identified by pathology reports . The median follow - up time for overall survival ( OS ) of the 306 patients was 68 . 27 months ( range : 3 . 85 – 75 . 02 months ) , and the median follow - up time for dis - ease - free survival ( DFS ) of the 306 patients was 69 . 41 months ( range : 2 . 14 – 75 . 02 months ) . Follow - ups for all patients were conducted until December 2013 or the time of death . The clinicopathological characteristics of the 306 included patients are summarized in Table 1 . In brief , paraffin - embedded BC TMA sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated . The TMA sections were subsequently submerged in citrate ( pH 6 . 0 ) and autoclaved at 120°C for 2 min . The samples were then quenched with 3 % H 2 O 2 for 10 min and blocked with goat serum for 10 min at room temperature ; a cooling period of 30 min pre - ceded the primary antibody incubation . The samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4°C : a rabbit polyclonal antibody for EHD1 ( ab51504 ; Abcam , Hong Kong ) , diluted at 1 : 80 ; a rabbit monoclonal instant antibody for pEGFR ( [ EP774Y ] ( ab40815 ) ; Abcam’s RabMAb ® technology ) , diluted to 1 : 200 ; and a mouse monoclonal RAB11FIP3 ( ZM - 0442 ; ZSGB - BIO , Tong et al . 3 China ) . Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase – linked secondary antibody for 20 min at room temperature , the tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin , dehy - drated in alcohol , and mounted . The degree of immu - nostaining was determined and scored separately for all samples by two independent investigators without prior knowledge of the clinicopathological data . IHC staining was scored according to the following criteria : − , 0 % – 5 % ; + , 6 % – 25 % ; + + , 26 % – 50 % ; and + + + , 51 % – 100 % of the cells stained . To optimally balance the multitude of the two sides divided based on the positive staining rate , a cutoff of 25 % was used for RAB11FIP3 and pEGFR , and 5 % was used for EHD1 . “Positive” indicates that the positive stain - ing cell rates were increased compared with the cutoff value , whereas “negative” indicates that the rate was lower or equal to the cutoff value . Two independent observers determined the percentage of stained cells and interpreted the results in a blinded fashion . Western blot analysis A total of 30 pairs of primary BC fresh tissues and cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) lysis buffer ( strong ; Beyotime , China ) in the presence of protease inhibitors ( Roche ) . Equal amounts of cellular pro - teins were loaded into each well and resolved using 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) gels . The samples were heated for 5 min at 95°C . Polyvinylidene fluoride membrane blotting was sub - sequently performed under standard conditions . For immu - noblotting , the following primary antibodies were used against pEGFR ( ab40815 ; Abcam , US ) , EHD1 ( ab51504 ; Abcam , Hong Kong ) , RAB11FIP3 ( ZM - 0442 ; ZSGB - BIO , China ) , and glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; Sigma ) . The primary antibody solution was diluted 1 : 1000 and incubated with the membrane overnight at 4°C . The primary antibody against GAPDH ( Sigma ) solution was diluted 1 : 5000 and incubated with the mem - brane overnight at 4°C . The membrane was subsequently washed three times for 10 min with a mixture of tris - buffered saline and Tween 20 ( TBS - T ) prior to adding a 1 : 5000 dilution of the secondary antibody , which was diluted in the TBS - T solution at room temperature . The membrane was then incubated on a swing bed for 1 h prior to three 10 - min washes with TBS - T . Statistical analysis Statistical calculations were conducted with the SPSS sta - tistical software package ( Version 17 . 0 ; SPSS , Inc . ) . The p - values of < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Correlations between expression levels were identified using Pearson coefficients . Chi - square tests were used to analyze the relationships among EHD1 , other proteins , and clinicopathological features . Cumulative OS curves were generated according to the Kaplan – Meier method , and the relationship between each variable and survival was assessed using a log - rank test in a univariate analysis . The parameters were subsequently tested via a multivari - ate Cox proportional hazard model , which was performed to identify independent variables that predict survival . Results Expression of cytoplasmic EHD1 , pEGFR , and RAB11FIP3 in BC tissues EHD1 expression is frequently up - regulated in human BC tissues . To determine whether EHD1 also plays a role in EGFR - mediated endocytosis recycling of human primary BC , we determined the expression patterns of EHD1 , pEGFR , and RAB11FIP3 and their clinicopathological fea - tures in breast carcinoma patients . Using IHC , we first determined the EHD1 , pEGFR , and RAB11FIP3 expression levels in the cytosol in a sample of patients . As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1 , we determined that the protein levels of EHD1 and pEGFR were significantly increased in the BC tissue ( p = 0 . 003 and p < 0 . 001 , respectively ) . RAB11FIP3 was not significantly different in the tumor tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues . IHC analysis indicated that the cytosolic EHD1 expression was increased 60 . 46 % in the BC samples , whereas EHD1 up - regulation only occurred in 38 . 00 % of the tumor - adjacent normal tissues . The frequen - cies of positive staining were 53 . 92 % for pEGFR and 37 . 25 % for RAB11FIP3 in the BC samples . Clinical significance of EHD1 , pEGFR , and RAB11FIP3 expression in BC tissues The protein levels of the variables are associated with the known clinicopathological characteristics of BC ( Table 2 ) .

The expression of pEGFR was positively correlated with HER2 expression ( p = 0 . 015 ) and Ki67 expression ( p = 0 . 015 ) ; however , the combined expression of EHD1 and pEGFR markers was not corre - lated with the clinical pathological correlation . The IHC scores indicated that the overexpression of EHD1 was strongly correlated with increased expression of pEGFR ( r = 0 . 242 , p < 0 . 001 ) and RAB11FIP3 ( r = 0 . 165 , p = 0 . 005 ) ( Table 3 ) . Thus , these findings suggest that a high expression of EHD1 is associated with an increase in EGFR - mediated endocytosis recycling , which likely con - tributes to the aggravation of EGFR - mediated endocytosis recycling in breast carcinoma . Consistent with the immu - nohistochemistry results , the Western blot analyses of the 30 pairs of primary BC and non - tumor samples indicated that mutant EGFRs exhibited increased levels of pEGFR , EHD1 , and RAB11FIP3 . The EHD1 expression increased to 36 . 67 % ( 11 / 30 ) in the BC tissues compared with 86 . 67 % ( 26 / 30 ) in the adjacent normal tissues from the control group ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Moreover , an up - regulation of pEGFR was identified in the BC tissues compared with their cor - responding normal samples , which ranged from 83 . 33 % ( 25 / 30 ) to 33 . 33 % ( 10 / 30 ) , respectively ( p < 0 . 001 ; Figure 2 ( a ) and ( b ) ) . OS / DFS univariate and multivariate analyses The expression level of EHD1 was closely associated with BC prognosis in the total group . To determine the prognosis of EHD1 in EGFR - mediated endocytosis recycling in the study population , we subsequently examined the asso - ciations among the expression of EHD1 , pEGFR , and RAB11FIP3 proteins and patient survival . We analyzed both the DFS and OS . In the univariate analysis , most char - acteristics were significant ( Figures 4 – 13 , Tables 5 – 7 ) . In general , the average DFS and OS durations in the patients with EHD1 up - regulation in the tumors were significantly shorter than the patients with overexpression of EHD1 in the tumors ( Figure 3 ) . In the multivariate analyses using a stratified Cox’s regression , differentiation ( poor / moderate vs well hazard ratio ( HR ) 3 . 421 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1 . 403 – 8 . 339 ) , TNM clinical stage ( III / IV vs II / I ; HR : 2 . 795 , 95 % CI : 1 . 573 – 4 . 965 ) , P53 expression ( positive vs negative ; HR : 1 . 977 , 95 % CI : 1 . 149 – 3 . 400 ) , EHD1 expres - sion ( positive vs negative ; HR : 3 . 147 , 95 % CI : 1 . 376 – 7 . 168 ) , and pEGFR expression ( positive vs negative ; HR : 2 . 084 , 95 % CI : 1 . 109 – 3 . 915 ) were identified as independ - ent prognostic factors for unfavorable OS in the total cohort ( n = 306 ; Figure 4 ) . As a consequence of the described results , the DFS rates were significantly lower in the patients with poor / moderate differentiation ( poor / moderate vs well ; HR : 5 . 163 , 95 % CI : 1 . 883 – 14 . 158 ) , a more advanced TNM clinical stage ( III / IV vs II / I ; HR : 4 . 393 , 95 % CI : 3 . 735 – 14 . 635 ) , P53 - positive expression ( positive vs negative ; HR : 2 . 463 , 95 % CI : 1 . 269 – 4 . 778 ) , and cluster A ( pEGFR + and EHD1 + ) combined markers ( cluster A vs cluster B ; HR : 5 . 174 , 95 % CI : 2 . 452 – 10 . 916 ; Figure 5 ) . The survival curves are shown in Figure 6 . The four subgroups were classified according to the combined expression status of the two proteins ( Figure 6 ) . For the OS and DFS , the patients with concordant increased pEGFR and EHD1 expression ( n = 117 ) were distinctly isolated from the other three groups ( p < 0 . 001 and p = 0 . 001 , respectively ) , including low pEGFR / high EHD1 ( n = 70 ) , high pEGFR / low EHD1 ( n = 49 ) , and low pEGFR / low EHD1 ( n = 70 ) . To simplify the data and illustrate a mechanistic framework , we consolidated the four groups into cluster A ( pEGFR + and EHD1 + , n = 117 ) and cluster B ( either pEGFR− or EHD1− , n = 189 ) . Regarding the clinicopathological variables , there was no significant difference . We divided the patients into two groups ( adjuvant chemotherapy - treated patients , n = 252 ; non - adjuvant Figure 1 .

In the multivariate analyses using a stratified Cox’s regression ( Figure 7 ) , the OS of the adju - vant chemotherapy - treated patients had a significantly worse prognosis in the patients with poor / moderate differ - entiation ( poor / moderate vs well ; HR : 3 . 042 , 95 % CI : 1 . 179 – 7 . 845 ) , a higher TNM clinical stage ( III / IV vs II / I ; HR : 11 . 583 , 95 % CI : 1 . 590 – 84 . 375 ) , P53 - positive expres - sion ( positive vs negative ; HR : 2 . 523 , 95 % CI : 1 . 359 – 4 . 689 ) , and EHD1 - positive expression ( positive vs negative ; HR : 4 . 723 , 95 % CI : 1 . 848−12 . 071 ; Figure 8 ) . Differentiation , AJCC stage , P53 expression , and com - bined expression of EHD1 and pEGFR markers were 6 Tumor Biology significant independent prognostic factors for the DFS of the adjuvant chemotherapy - treated patients with HRs of 3 . 834 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 277 – 11 . 512 ) , HRs of 10 . 285 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 400 – 75 . 552 ) , HRs of 2 . 853 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 405 – 5 . 794 ) , and HRs of 4 . 625 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 130 – 10 . 041 ) . Notably , the com - bined marker expression was the strongest independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis ( Figure 9 ) . For the non - adjuvant chemotherapy - treated patients , pEGFR , EHD1 , and combined expression of EHD1 and pEGFR markers were not significantly correlated with the OS in the multivariate analysis . We also divided the patients into two groups ( HER2 - positive patients , n = 252 ; HER2 - negative patients , n = 54 ) Figure 2 .

Tong et al . 7 Figure 3 . Kaplan – Meier survival plot of OS and DFS stratified according to EHD1 and pEGFR expression in all patients . The positive EHD1 , positive pEGFR , and cluster A ( EHD1 + and pEGFR + ) groups were associated with significantly shorter OS and DFS than the negative EHD1 , negative pEGFR , and cluster B ( non - EHD1 + and pEGFR + ) groups . based on the HER2 status ( Figure 10 ) . The multivariate anal - ysis indicated that differentiation , TNM clinical stage , P53 expression , EHD1 expression , and pEGFR expression were significantly independent prognostic factors for the OS of HER2 positive with HRs of 4 . 656 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 406 – 15 . 414 ) , HRs of 12 . 085 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 640 – 89 . 065 ) , HRs of 2 . 025 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 019 – 4 . 022 ) , HRs of 2 . 945 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 253 – 6 . 923 ) , and HRs of 2 . 230 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 022 – 4 . 866 ; Figure 11 ) . Poor / moderate differentiation ( HR : 6 . 113 , 95 % CI : 1 . 519 – 24 . 607 ) , a high TNM clinical stage ( HR : 9 . 649 , 95 % CI : 1 . 299 – 71 . 670 ) , P53 - positive expression ( HR : 2 . 462 , 95 % CI : 1 . 136 – 5 . 335 ) , and combined expression of EHD1 and pEGFR markers ( HR : 7 . 559 , 95 % CI : 3 . 004 – 19 . 024 ) were identified as independent prognostic factors for an unfavora - ble OS in the HER2 - positive patients ( n = 252 ; Figure 12 ) . The pEGFR , EHD1 , and combined expression of EHD1 and pEGFR markers were not significantly correlated with the OS in the HER2 - negative patients ( n = 54 ) . Using the same method in the ER - positive patients ( n = 196 ) , the multivariate analysis indicated that age , differ - entiation , AJCC stage , P53 expression , and combined expression of EHD1 and pEGFR markers were significant independent prognostic factors for the OS with HRs of 2 . 584 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 174 – 5 . 687 ) , 17 . 025 ( 95 % CI : 4 . 879 – 59 . 409 ) , 18 . 962 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 228 – 161 . 395 ) , 2 . 237 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 042 – 4 . 801 ) , and 2 . 222 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 034 – 4 . 775 ; Table 5 , Figure 13 ) . The DFS rates of the ER - positive patients were signifi - cantly lower in the patients with poor / moderate differentia - tion ( HR : 20 . 099 , 95 % CI : 4 . 133 – 97 . 931 ) , a higher TNM clinical stage ( HR : 9 . 901 , 95 % CI : 1 . 122 – 87 . 374 ) , PR - positive expression ( HR : 0 . 184 , 95 % CI : 0 . 049 – 0 . 693 ) , P53 - positive expression ( HR : 4 . 389 , 95 % CI : 1 . 611 – 11 . 959 ) , and combined markers ( cluster A : pEGFR + and EHD1 + ; HR : 7 . 21 , 95 % CI : 2 . 265 – 22 . 947 ; Table 6 , Figure 13 ) . A sta - tistically significant improvement in the OS was identified in the ER - negative patients with a higher TNM clinical stage ( III / IV vs II / I ; HR : 3 , 95 % CI : 1 . 255 – 60 . 235 ) and combined markers ( cluster A : cluster A vs cluster B ; HR : 3 . 547 , 95 % CI : 1 . 613 – 7 . 800 ; Table 7 , Figure 14 ) . However , for the DFS of the ER - negative patients , the pEGFR , EHD1 , and com - bined expression of EHD1 and pEGFR markers were not significantly correlated with the OS in the multivariate anal - ysis ( Table 8 , Figure 14 ) .

EGF and EGFR may be sorted to late endosomes from sorting endosomes for degradation in lysosomes ; alterna - tively , it may return to the cell surface , and this process is referred to as recycling . There are two modes of recycling : one mode comprises direct return ( fast recycling pathway ) , and the other mode is indirect via the ERC to cell mem - brane ( slow recycling pathway ) . 6 , 30 In the slow recycling pathway , the important part of EGFR signaling is the regu - lation of receptor transportation and degradation . It has been demonstrated that EGFR undergoes rapid internaliza - tion and degradation following the stimulation of EGF in various cell types , and during this process , many proteins and lipids have critical roles , such as EHD1 and RAB11FIP3 . 13 , 15 , 31 Endocytosis recycling plays an important role in nor - mal human cell transportation , and it is an important medium of biological macromolecules and protein trans - port . EGFRs enter normal cells through EHD1 - mediated endocytosis recycling to return to the cell membrane for subsequent use . However , the function of EHD1 has rarely been reported in tumor tissues ; it has only been associated with endocytosis recycling in non - small - cell lung can - cer . 23 , 32 Overexpression of caveolin - 1 ( CAV - 1 ) promote EGFR endocytosis in the previous article without publica - tion has been confirmed . This finding is similar to the results of Qing wei Meng et al . 33 EHD1 expression was correlated with the histology type , TNM stages , nodal metastasis , and HER2 expres - sion , and its expression increased in the HER2 positive group . In BC cell lines with increased EGFR expression , the expression of EHD1 also increased . In addition , increased of EHD1 expression promoted the pEGFR to the cell membrane and accelerated it for subsequent use , whereas it promoted BC cell proliferation and malignant transformation . EHD1 mediated the internalization and degradation of EGFR , and it is conducive to the accumula - tion of EGFR on the cell surface , which eventually leads to an altered EGFR signal . Furthermore , cluster A ( EHD1 + and pEGFR + ) was associated with the state of HER2 . EHD1 and Rab11 regulate recycling from the perinu - clear ERC to the plasma membrane in normal cells , and RAB11FIP3 participation in recycling is located upstream of EHD1 . 15 , 34 This research has demonstrated that RAB11FIP3 was positively correlated with EHD1 and EGFR ; however , there was no significant difference between carcinoma and normal tissues , and it did not affect the prognosis . The study indicated that RAB11FIP3 is involved in endocytosis recycling in BC and promotes EGFR transportation . The Rab11 GTPase effector proteins FIP3 and cytoplasmic dynein mediate the transport of material from peripheral sorting endosomes to the cen - trally located ERC . 28 It is also demonstrated that the Rab11 effector , as a ligand of EHD , cooperates with EHD1 adjust - ment of the exit from the ERC to the plasma membrane 35 and is associated with the expression of ER , HER2 , and Ki67 in clinical pathology . In this study , we also demonstrated that the RAB11FIP3 expression was positively correlated with Ki67 , and there were differences between the negative and positive groups of Ki67 in BC , in which the expression was increased in 16 Tumor Biology the positive group . Normal cell division in mammals is homologous with fruit fly NUF , and RAB11 combined with RAB11FIP3 ( also referred to as FIP3 ) to control cyto - plasmic division . 14 However , it has not been reported whether RAB11FIP3 is related to tumors . As an important indicator of cell proliferation , Ki67 influences the progno - sis of BC . 36 , 37 In this research , we analyzed all samples , including the chemotherapy , HER2 - negative , and ER - positive and ER - negative groups , via multivariable analysis of the DFS and OS . With the exception of the histological grade , the TNM stage , P53 , EHD1 , and pEGFR represent independ - ent factors that affect the prognosis . Furthermore , for the DFS , cluster A ( EHD1 + and pEGFR + ) has a greater influ - ence compared with EHD1 and pEGFR alone in the prog - nosis ( with the exception of the DFS of the ER group ) . These findings indicate that the combined expression of EHD1 and pEGFR markers may help physicians predict the time from postoperative to disease recurrence and sub - sequently judge patient prognosis .
