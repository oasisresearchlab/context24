REVIEW ARTICLE OPEN Neutralizing antibodies for the prevention and treatment of COVID - 19 Lanying Du 1 ✉ , Yang Yang 2 and Xiujuan Zhang 1 © The Author ( s ) 2021 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) initiates the infection process by binding to the viral cellular receptor angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 through the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) in the S1 subunit of the viral spike ( S ) protein . This event is followed by virus – cell membrane fusion mediated by the S2 subunit , which allows virus entry into the host cell . Therefore , the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein is a key therapeutic target , and prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) have focused on the development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( nAbs ) that target this protein . In this review , we summarize the nAbs targeting SARS - CoV - 2 proteins that have been developed to date , with a focus on the N - terminal domain and RBD of the S protein . We also describe the roles that binding af ﬁ nity , neutralizing activity , and protection provided by these nAbs play in the prevention and treatment of COVID - 19 and discuss the potential to improve nAb ef ﬁ ciency against multiple SARS - CoV - 2 variants . This review provides important information for the development of effective nAbs with broad - spectrum activity against current and future SARS - CoV - 2 strains .

The major clinical features of COVID - 19 include fever , shortness of breath , cough , headache , and fatigue , which can lead to severe pneumonia , lung injury , acute respiratory / multiorgan failure , and death [ 1 – 4 ] . A variety of risk factors , including older age , hypertension , obesity , diabetes mellitus , and cardiovascular comorbidities , are associated with COVID - 19 [ 5 – 8 ] . As of July 16 , 2021 , the WHO had reported over 188 . 6 million con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 cases and more than 4 million deaths worldwide , resulting in devastating damage . Although several vaccines , including two mRNA vaccines ( BNT162b2 and mRNA - 1273 ) and one adenovirus - based vaccine ( Ad . 26 . COV2 . S ) , have been authorized by the U . S . FDA for immunizing persons 16 years and older ( BNT162b2 ) or 18 years ( mRNA - 1273 ) and older to prevent COVID - 19 [ 9 – 11 ] , effective countermeasures are still needed to control the global COVID - 19 pandemic . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) is the causative agent of COVID - 19 . It belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family in the order Nidovirales . SARS - CoV - 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) , two other highly pathogenic corona - viruses ﬁ rst reported in 2002 and 2012 , respectively [ 12 , 13 ] , are also betacoronaviruses . Both SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS - CoV have limited transmission among humans , leading to case fatality rates of approximately 10 % ( 774 / 8098 ) for SARS - CoV - 1 [ 14 ] and approximately 34 . 4 % ( 886 / 2574 ) for MERS - CoV . Compared to SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS - CoV , SARS - CoV - 2 exhibits superior human - to - human transmissibility [ 15 – 17 ] , potentially contribut - ing to its widespread infection and the global COVID - 19 pandemic . Similar to other coronaviruses , SARS - CoV - 2 is an enveloped , single - stranded , and positive - sense RNA virus [ 18 ] . The viral genome encodes four major structural proteins ( spike ( S ) , membrane ( M ) , envelope ( E ) , and nucleocapsid ( N ) ) ( Fig . 1a ) , several nonstructural proteins ( NSP1 - 16 ) , and a series of accessory proteins , including 3a , 6 , 7a , 7b , 8 , and 10 [ 18 , 19 ] . NSP proteins form replication - transcription complexes and mainly participate in biological processes , such as viral replication , protein processing , transcription , and proteolysis . Some function as RNA - dependent RNA polymerases , in addition to binding ATP and zinc ions [ 19 , 20 ] . The E and M proteins may be involved in RNA packaging and virus assembly and release ; the E protein has evolved to include a robust membrane topology , and it forms either a cation channel regulated by pH or an ion channel potentially inhibited by gliclazide and memantine [ 19 , 21 – 23 ] . The N protein , which is located inside the virion , is responsible for RNA packaging and virus replication . It contains phosphorylation and protein kinase sites and might be important in modulating antiviral immunity and inhibiting interferon production by targeting the retinoic acid inducible gene - I - like receptor pathway [ 24 – 26 ] .

The S protein contains the S1 and S2 subdomains ( Fig . 1a , b ) , which are responsible for host cell receptor binding and membrane fusion , respectively , mediated through the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) in the S1 region ( Fig . 1c ) and heptad repeat region 1 ( HR1 ) and HR2 in the S2 region [ 27 , 28 ] . The N - terminal domain ( NTD ) is located on the S1 subunit ( Fig . 1c ) and has the potential to bind sialic acids or coreceptors [ 29 , 30 ] , but its speci ﬁ c function is still not fully understood . The RBD is composed of a core and a receptor - binding motif ( RBM ) , and the latter is responsible for binding to the SARS - CoV - 2 receptor [ 28 , 31 ] . Similar to SARS - CoV - 1 and some SARS - like bat coronaviruses , such as W1V1 - CoV , SHC014 - CoV , and RaTG13 , SARS - CoV - 2 utilizes angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) as its functional cellular receptor to enter target cells to initiate the virus infection process [ 28 , 32 ] . In addition to ACE2 , SARS - CoV - 2 also uses the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming [ 33 ] . Moreover , neuropilin - 1 , a cofactor for binding furin - cleaved substrates , facilitates SARS - CoV - 2 cell entry and infectivity [ 34 ] . Cryo - EM and / or crystal structures of the SARS - CoV - 2 S - trimer / ACE2 and RBD / ACE2 complexes have been resolved ( Fig . 1d ) . The prefusion conformation of the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein in cryo - EM analysis presents as a trimeric structure consisting of three RBDs , with one RBD in the “ up ” conformation , allowing access to the ACE2 receptor [ 35 , 36 ] . ACE2 recognizes the RBD through polar residues in its extracellular peptidase domain [ 37 ] . Analysis of the crystal structure of the RBD / ACE2 complex has identi ﬁ ed critical residues in the RBD that are essential for binding to the ACE2 receptor , eight of which are identical in the SARS - CoV - 2 and SARS - CoV - 1 RBDs ; the RBM contains most of the amino acid residues necessary for binding to ACE2 [ 31 ] . Relative to the SARS - CoV - 1 S RBD , the SARS - CoV - 2 S RBD has a higher binding af ﬁ nity for ACE2 [ 28 , 35 , 38 ] , partially explaining the more ef ﬁ cient human - to - human transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . During SARS - CoV - 2 infection , the RBD in the S1 subunit of the S protein ﬁ rst binds the cellular receptor ACE2 to form an RBD / ACE2 complex ( Figs 1 and 2 ) . This binding event leads to conformational changes in the S protein and subsequent dissociation of the S1 and S2 subunits . Mediated by the HR1 / HR2 domains in the S2 subunit , the viral and host cell membrane fusion process occurs , allowing the virus to enter the host cell and release viral RNA [ 39 ] . Subsequently , newly synthesized viral RNA – N complexes and S , E , and M proteins are further assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum – Golgi intermediate compartment to form mature virions , which are released from host cells [ 40 ] . Relative to SARS - CoV - 1 , SARS - CoV - 2 demonstrates better membrane fusion ability , and changes in several amino acid residues in the HR1 domain potentially contribute to the increased protein – protein interac - tions with the HR2 domain [ 27 ] . A better understanding of the viral life cycle and associated infection process will be helpful for designing effective vaccines and therapeutic agents to control the COVID - 19 pandemic .

Du et al . 2294 Cellular & Molecular Immunology ( 2021 ) 18 : 2293 – 2306 1234567890 ( ) ; , : SARS - COV - 2 - SPECIFIC NEUTRALIZING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND THEIR MECHANISMS OF ACTION Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( nAbs ) serve as key therapeutic agents for the rapid prevention and treatment of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Anti – SARS - CoV - 2 human nAbs can be isolated from antigen - speci ﬁ c B cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of individuals who have been infected with SARS - CoV - 2 ( Fig . 2a ) . They can also be generated by screening naive or synthetic phage - displayed human antibody libraries ( Fig . 2b ) [ 41 – 51 ] . Most of these antibodies target the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein , including its sub - domains , and they present different mechanisms of action in the inhibition of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Generally , nAbs targeting the S protein block receptor binding or membrane fusion , thereby preventing viral entry into host cells . Speci ﬁ cally , RBD - targeting nAbs bind to the RBD in the RBM region and inhibit RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor , thus blocking the subsequent viral entry process ( Fig . 2c ) . Some non - ACE2 mimics target the RBD without inhibiting RBD - ACE2 binding and may instead inhibit SARS - CoV - 2 infection by blocking S protein conformational changes . NTD - targeting nAbs bind to the NTD of the S protein , and the recognition sites may contain N - glycosylation sites [ 52 , 53 ] . They neutralize SARS - CoV - 2 infection by potentially preventing the interaction of the NTD with C - type lectin receptors , such as L - SIGN , inhibiting S protein or NTD conformational changes , or interrupting virus postattachment steps ( cell – cell fusion ) ( Fig . 2d ) [ 41 , 52 , 54 – 56 ] . However , these nAbs do not generally block the receptor binding and viral attachment steps . In contrast to NTD - speci ﬁ c nAbs that neutralize SARS - CoV - 2 infection , some NTD - targeting non - nAbs can induce the open conformation of the RBD , resulting in enhanced binding of the RBD to the ACE2 receptor and thus increasing SARS - CoV - 2 infectivity [ 57 ] . Both NTD - and RBD - targeting nAbs may activate Fc - mediated effector functions , antibody - dependent cellular phagocytosis , or antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity , which are potentially required for optimal protection against SARS - CoV - 2 challenge [ 41 , 54 , 58 , 59 ] . S2 - targeting nAbs may inhibit HR1 or HR2 from forming a six - helix bundle structure , thereby blocking subsequent membrane fusion and the viral entry process ( Fig . 2d ) . ANTIGENIC VIEW OF THE NTD AND RBD OF SARS - COV - 2 S PROTEIN AND NAB BINDING SITES Antigenic view of SARS - CoV - 2 NTD and nAb binding sites The NTD of the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein is an immunodominant target to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies , although the neutralizing activity of nAbs targeting the NTD is generally much lower than that of the nAbs targeting the RBD . Antigenic and / or epitope mapping of the NTD has identi ﬁ ed several supersites of SARS - CoV - 2 recognized by NTD - speci ﬁ c nAbs [ 41 , 52 ] . NTD - speci ﬁ c nAbs can be categorized into two distinct groups : a group with high potency against SARS - CoV - 2 infection and a group with less potency but displaying glycan - dependent neutralizing activity [ 53 ] . Antigenic view of SARS - CoV - 2 RBD and nAb binding sites The RBD of the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein is an immunodominant target for inducing the production of highly potent and speci ﬁ c neutralizing antibodies . Analysis of the binding between the RBD and RBD - speci ﬁ c nAbs , as well as the inhibition of RBD - ACE2 binding by nAbs , reveals different antigenic regions on the RBD . These regions can be clustered based on the site for antibody attachment that overlaps the ACE2 binding site , as well as the antibody binding site that does not compete with ACE2 binding [ 60 ] . Nevertheless , the N and C termini of the RBD generally have less ability to bind nAbs [ 60 ] . Accordingly , RBD - targeting nAbs are classi ﬁ ed into different groups based on the recognized epitopes Fig . 2 Generation of SARS - CoV - 2 - targeting human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( nAbs ) and their mechanisms of action . nAbs speci ﬁ c to SARS - CoV - 2 can be generated by single B cell cloning ( a ) or phage display library screening ( b ) . c nAbs targeting the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) of the spike ( S ) protein bind to the RBD in the S1 subunit and block its binding with the angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) receptor , thus preventing virus entry into host cells through endocytosis or cell surface fusion processes . d nAbs targeting the N - terminal domain ( NTD ) in the S1 subunit or S2 bind to the NTD or S2 subunit , thus inhibiting the conformational change of the S protein or NTD or the formation of a 6 - helix bundle ( 6 - HB ) structure mediated by heptad repeat region 1 ( HR1 ) and HR2 in the S2 subunit , further blocking membrane fusion and virus entry into the host cell L .

Du et al . 2297 Cellular & Molecular Immunology ( 2021 ) 18 : 2293 – 2306 on the RBD . These groups include nAbs binding to the RBD site distal to the ACE2 receptor - binding site ( normally having low neutralizing activity ) and nAbs directly competing with the ACE2 binding site at the RBM region ( generally presenting the most potent neutralizing activity ) ; other RBD - speci ﬁ c nAbs recognize epitopes partially overlapping with or further distal from the above sites [ 53 ] . Following the COVID - 19 pandemic , an increasing number of human nAbs targeting SARS - CoV - 2 proteins were identi ﬁ ed and developed as therapeutics . The majority of these nAbs target different regions of the S protein , including the NTD and RBD , whereas a few antibodies target other proteins . In the rest of this review , we will summarize the SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c nAbs currently developed based on the domains they target in the viral proteins . Neutralizing antibodies targeting the NTD of SARS - CoV - 2 S protein As part of the S1 domain of the S protein , the NTD is a key target for the development of COVID - 19 nAbs , and several of the currently developed human nAbs bind to this region . These NTD - targeting nAbs may neutralize SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vitro or protect animals from viral challenge ( Table 1 ) [ 41 , 44 , 54 , 55 , 61 ] . However , it appears that none of these NTD - targeting nAbs have been tested in humans . Binding ability of SARS - CoV - 2 NTD - targeting nAbs . NTD - targeting nAbs bind to the SARS - CoV - 2 NTD and S1 fragments of the S protein and / or S protein trimer . Cryo - EM and crystal structure analyses have identi ﬁ ed critical neutralizing epitopes for several SARS - CoV - 2 NTD - targeting nAbs ( Fig . 3a – f ) [ 41 , 44 , 55 , 56 ] . For example , cryo - EM and crystal structures of the S2L28 / S , S2M28 / S , S2X28 / S , S2X333 / S , and S2M28 / NTD complexes reveal that these nAbs recognize overlapping epitopes within a structurally identi ﬁ ed antigenic supersite in the NTD of the S protein [ 41 ] . In addition , cryo - EM and / or crystal structures of NTD - speci ﬁ c nAbs , such as 5 - 24 , 1 - 87 , and 2 - 51 , in complex with S or the NTD reveal a single supersite surrounded by glycans at N17 , N74 , N122 , and N149 , which is located at the periphery of S facing away from the viral membrane [ 56 ] . Thus , structural analysis of nAb / S and nAb / NTD complexes is helpful for determining which residues are important for nAb binding to the NTD of S and identifying neutralizing epitopes recognized by these nAbs . Neutralizing activity of SARS - CoV - 2 NTD - targeting nAbs . SARS - CoV - 2 NTD - targeting nAbs can neutralize wild - type pseudotyped and / or authentic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vitro . Pseudotyped and authentic SARS - CoV - 2 have been found to be neutralized by nAbs 4 - 8 and 5 - 24 with a half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC 50 ) of 8 – 9 ng / ml [ 44 ] . nAb 4A8 also has been shown to neutralize both pseudovirus and live SARS - CoV - 2 infection with a half - maximal effective concentration ( EC 50 ) of 0 . 61 and 49 μ g / ml , respectively [ 55 ] . 89C8 has been found to neutralize infection of pseudotyped SARS - CoV - 2 , with an IC 50 of 4 . 5 nM [ 61 ] , whereas nAbs BLN1 , BLN12 , and P008 _ 056 have been shown to neutralize authentic SARS - CoV - 2 infection with IC 50 values of 8 , 8 , and 14 ng / ml , respectively [ 52 , 53 ] . Moreover , S2L28 , S2M28 , S2X28 , and S2X333 have been found to potently neutralize infection of both pseudotyped and live SARS - CoV - 2 with an IC 50 value as low as 2 ng / ml [ 41 ] . The differences in potency of these nAbs against SARS - CoV - 2 infection might result in part from differences in the neutralization assays and virus strains used for detecting neutralizing activity . Protective ef ﬁ cacy of SARS - CoV - 2 NTD - targeting nAbs . Several NTD - targeting nAbs have demonstrated prophylactic and ther - apeutic protective ef ﬁ cacy against SARS - CoV - 2 infection in animal models , such as hACE2 - transgenic ( hACE2 - Tg ) mice and hamsters [ 41 , 54 ] . For example , COV2 - 2676 and COV2 - 2489 , which bind to a common antigenic site on the NTD and inhibit pseudotyped and authentic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vitro , have been found to prophylactically and therapeutically protect hACE2 - Tg mice from SARS - CoV - 2 infection . These animals exhibited reduced weight Fig . 3 Structures of SARS - CoV - 2 spike ( S ) in complex with N - terminal domain ( NTD ) - targeting neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( nAbs ) . a – e Cryo - EM structures of the SARS - CoV - 2 S trimer bound to NTD - targeting nAbs a S2L28 ( PDB 7LXZ ) , b S2M28 ( PDB 7LY2 ) , c S2X333 ( PDB 7LXY ) , d 4 - 8 ( PDB 7LQV ) , and e 4A8 ( PDB 7C2L ) . f Crystal structure of the SARS - CoV - 2 NTD in complex with the nAb S2M28 ( PDB 7LY3 ) L .

Du et al . 2299 Cellular & Molecular Immunology ( 2021 ) 18 : 2293 – 2306 loss , decreased viral titers in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and heart , or reduced cytokine and chemokine levels in the lung [ 54 ] . NTD - targeting nAbs 159 , BLN12 , and BLN14 have been shown to therapeutically protect against SARS - CoV - 2 infection in antibody - treated hACE2 - Tg mice , preventing weight loss , with reduced viral titers and / or RNA copies in the nasal washes , lung , and other tissues [ 52 , 60 ] . Moreover , S2X333 has been found to prophylactically protect hamsters from SARS - CoV - 2 infection ; these animals had reduced viral RNA copies and / or viral titers in the lung [ 41 ] . Cross - reactivity and cross - neutralizing activity of SARS - CoV - 2 NTD - targeting nAbs . SARS - CoV - 2 NTD - targeting nAbs may cross - react with other coronaviruses and / or cross - neutralize their infection to some extent . This phenomenon is observed for S2L28 , S2M28 , S2X28 , and S2X333 , which strongly bind to the S protein of RaTG13 ( a bat coronavirus most closely related to SARS - CoV - 2 ) and neutralize infection by pseudotyped RaTG13 expressing the viral S protein . However , their ability to bind to other coronavirus S proteins , such as those from Pangolin Guangxi 2017 and Pangolin Guangdong 2019 , is reduced , and none of them neutralize infection by human SARS - CoV - 1 , Pangolin Guangxi 2017 , Pangolin Guangdong 2019 , bat W1V1 , or bat W1V16 pseudoviruses [ 41 ] . These differences in binding af ﬁ nity and subsequent viral neutralization may result from sequence variation within the S protein NTD regions for each coronavirus . Neutralizing antibodies targeting the RBD of SARS - CoV - 2 S protein The SARS - CoV - 2 S protein RBD is a critical target for the development of effective COVID - 19 antibodies . SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs have been extensively studied , and most of the currently developed human nAbs are speci ﬁ c to this region . These nAbs bind to the RBD of SARS - CoV - 2 S , neutralize SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vitro , and / or protect animals from SARS - CoV - 2 challenge ( Table 1 ) . However , most of these nAbs are in preclinical development , and only a few have progressed into human clinical trials [ 62 ] . Binding and cross - reactivity of SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs . RBD - targeting SARS - CoV - 2 nAbs generally have high binding af ﬁ nities to the RBD of SARS - CoV - 2 S . Most of the RBD - targeting nAbs , including P2C - 1F11 , P2B - 2F6 , P2C - IA3 , P5A - 1B8 , P5A - 2G7 , MD62 , MD65 , COVA1 - 18 , COVA2 - 15 , IgG1 ab1 , CV07 - 209 , MV05 , CA1 , CB6 , CT - P59 , Ab6 , ab8 , V H - Fc ab8 , m397 , and 1212C2 , bind to the ACE2 - binding region of the RBD , directly blocking the binding interaction between the RBD and the cellular receptor ACE2 [ 43 , 47 – 49 , 59 , 63 – 68 ] . Other nAbs , including TAU - 1109 , MD29 , and MD47 , strongly bind to the RBD but at regions distal to the ACE2 binding site ; hence , they do not compete with ACE2 for RBD binding [ 48 ] . Only a few SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - speci ﬁ c nAbs , such as CV38 - 142 , COVA1 - 07 , COVA1 - 16 , COVA2 - 02 , COVA2 - 44 , and CoV2 - 12 , cross - react against SARS - CoV - 1 S and / or RBD proteins , potentially because they recognize conserved epitopes within the SARS - CoV - 2 and SARS - CoV - 1 RBDs [ 43 , 51 , 64 ] . Cryo - EM and crystal structures are available for several SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs in complex with the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein RBD ( Fig . 4 ) [ 44 , 47 , 49 , 64 , 65 , 69 ] . Cryo - EM structures of the nAb Fab or IgG and SARS - CoV - 2 S trimer complexes reveal that the binding of nAbs with the three RBDs can result in multiple conformations : three “ down ” RBDs , one “ up ” and two “ down ” RBDs , one or two “ up ” RBDs , two “ up ” RBDs , or two or three “ up ” RBDs ( Fig . 4a – e ) [ 44 , 63 ] . Relative to the Fab nAb , the IgG nAb exhibits more potency in neutralizing SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 63 ] . Crystal structures of CT - P59 , CV07 - 250 , or CV07 - 270 ( Fab / IgG ) and RBD complexes show that CT - P59 and CV07 - 250 directly interact with or obscure the ACE2 binding sites , while CV07 - 270 only partially overlaps with these binding sites ( Fig . 4f – g ) [ 47 , 64 ] . Crystal analysis of the P2B - 2F6 Fab / RBD complex reveals that the epitopes recognized by the nAb are in the RBM region ( Fig . 4h ) , demonstrating that the blockage of viral entry by this nAb is achieved through inhibiting ACE2 binding [ 49 ] . The crystal structure of the CV30 Fab / RBD complex also indicates that CV30 binds to epitopes necessary for ACE2 receptor binding ( Fig . 4i ) [ 69 ] . A crystal structure of the CB6 Fab / RBD complex reveals an epitope on the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein RBD that overlaps with the ACE2 binding sites ( Fig . 4j ) [ 65 ] . Accordingly , structural analyses of the binding interactions between human nAbs and the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein and / or RBD can map the common neutralizing epitopes recognized by these nAbs within the RBD , reveal the similarities between nAb / RBD binding and ACE2 / RBD binding , and explain the differences , if any , between these antibodies in competing with the ACE2 receptor [ 64 , 70 – 72 ] . These structures also help to elucidate the mechanisms by which these nAbs neutralize SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Neutralizing and cross - neutralizing activity of SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs . Most , if not all , nAbs speci ﬁ c to the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein RBD potently neutralize wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 pseudovirus and / or live virus infection in vitro , and they present more potent neutralizing activity than nAbs targeting non - RBD epitopes . These nAbs , including COVA1 - 18 , COVA2 - 15 , CV07 - 209 , CC6 . 29 , CC6 . 30 , CC12 . 1 , P008 _ 108 , 1212C2 , and V H - Fc ab8 , have been found to neutralize pseudovirus and / or live SARS - CoV - 2 infection with high potency ( IC 50 ≤ 40 ng / ml ) [ 43 , 53 , 64 , 67 , 68 , 73 ] . The TAU - 1145 , TAU - 2189 , TAU - 2230 , and TAU - 2303 nAbs , which recognize a key residue ( G466 ) in the RBD , have been shown to neutralize both pseudotyped and live SARS - CoV - 2 infection , inhibiting cell death or syncytium formation [ 45 ] . It has been noted that some RBD - targeting nAbs also neutralize infection by mutant variants of SARS - CoV - 2 but at different potencies . CT - 59 has been found to neutralize wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 and the D614G mutant with IC 50 values of 8 . 4 and 5 . 7 ng / ml , respectively [ 47 ] . Other nAbs , such as J08 , I14 , F05 , G12 , C14 , and B07 , have been shown to neutralize D614G and B . 1 . 1 . 7 variants to different extents , and J08 has been found to also neutralize the E484K variant , albeit with relatively lower neutralizing activity [ 62 ] . Among the identi ﬁ ed SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs , CC6 . 33 , COVA2 - 02 , and COVA1 - 16 also neutralize SARS - CoV - 1 but at relatively high IC 50 values of 162 , 610 , and 2 , 500 ng / ml , respectively [ 43 , 73 ] . Most other SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs appear to have low or no cross - neutralizing activity against infection with SARS - CoV - 1 , MERS - CoV , or other coronaviruses [ 49 ] . Protective ef ﬁ cacy of SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs . A number of SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - speci ﬁ c nAbs have demonstrated protective ef ﬁ cacy in different animal models , including mice ( wild - type mice , adenovirus - hACE2 ( AdV - hACE2 ) - transduced mice , and hACE2 - Tg mice ) , hamsters , ferrets , and nonhuman primates ( NHPs ) [ 44 , 47 , 59 , 64 , 67 , 68 , 74 – 76 ] . RBD - targeting nAbs without Fc engineering protect against SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vivo . For instance , IgG ab1 and V H - Fc ab8 have been found to prophylacti - cally protect wild - type mice from infection with mouse - adapted SARS - CoV - 2 and / or hACE2 - Tg mice from infection with authentic SARS - CoV - 2 [ 51 , 59 , 67 ] . IgG ab1 , V H - Fc ab8 , 1212C2 , CV07 - 209 , and CC12 . 1 have been shown to prophylactically and / or therapeutically protect hamsters from wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 59 , 64 , 67 , 68 , 73 ] . CT - 59 has been found to exhibit therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy in preventing authentic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in ferret , hamster , and NHP models , whereas 2 - 15 , COV2 - 2196 , and COV2 - 2381 have been shown to prophylactically protect hamsters or rhesus macaques from SARS - CoV - 2 infection by inhibiting viral replication [ 44 , 47 , 75 ] . It has been reported that Fc - engineered SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs also provide protection against SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vivo . For example , J08 - MUT , which contains an Fc - engineered fragment of J08 , has been found to L . Du et al . 2300 Cellular & Molecular Immunology ( 2021 ) 18 : 2293 – 2306 prophylactically and therapeutically protect hamsters from wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 62 ] . In addition , the Fc - engineered MV05 and CB6 nAbs , with LALA mutations in the Fc domain , namely , MV05 - LALA and CB6 ( LALA ) , respectively , have been shown to prophylactically and therapeutically protect NHPs from SARS - CoV - 2 viral challenge [ 65 , 74 ] . In addition to using the intraperitoneal ( I . P . ) route and parenteral routes , including intramuscular , subcutaneous , and intravenous injections , SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs can be administered via inhalation without reducing protective ef ﬁ cacy [ 47 , 59 , 62 , 68 , 73 , 74 ] . For example , inhalation administration of Fc - engineered 1212C2 has been shown to eliminate viral loads in the lungs of SARS - CoV - 2 - challenged hamsters , resulting in better ef ﬁ ciency than injection via the I . P . route [ 68 ] . It is worth noting that the effective concentrations of nAbs required for the protection of animals against SARS - CoV - 2 infection vary depending on the differences in nAb potency , viral titers , and strains and the animal models used for the challenge . It has been reported that serum concentrations of ~ 22 and 12 μ g / ml ( pseudovirus neutralization IC 50 ×1160 and 630 , respectively ) of CC12 . 1 nAb protect hamsters challenged with SARS - CoV - 2 ( USA - WA1 / 2020 strain , 1 × 10 6 plaque - forming units ) from weight loss ( 100 % or 50 % , respectively ) [ 73 ] . It appears that the neutralization potency of nAbs in vitro does not always correlate well with their protective ef ﬁ cacy in vivo [ 77 ] . This discrepancy might be because the Fc effector function of nAbs affects their ability to neutralize SARS - CoV - 2 in vivo ; thus , identi ﬁ cation of optimal nAb concentrations in monotherapy or combinatorial therapy is needed to maximize nAb protection against SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 77 ] . Combination treatments with SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs . Combination treatments with SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs have exhibited synergistic effects in preventing infection by escape mutants or improving their neutralization in vitro and / or protecting against SARS - CoV - 2 infection in animal models . In vitro , a cocktail of CoV2 - 06 and CoV2 - 14 has been found to effectively prevent SARS - CoV - 2 infection by escape mutants , but neither nAb had this effect individually [ 51 ] . The combination of TAU - 2212 ( which recognizes an unknown conformational epitope on the S protein ) with an ACE2 - competing , RBD - binding nAb ( such as TAU - 2230 , TAU - 2189 , TAU - 1145 , or TAU - 2303 ) , and a non - ACE2 - competing / RBD - targeting nAb ( TAU - 1099 ) has been shown to improve its ef ﬁ ciency in inhibiting SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 45 ] . Furthermore , the RBD - targeting nAbs COV2 - 2196 and COV2 - 2130 , which block RBD - ACE2 binding but recognize the nonoverlapping sites on the RBD of SARS - CoV - 2 , have been shown to synergis - tically neutralize SARS - CoV - 2 infection with improved neutralizing activity compared with each of the two nAbs alone [ 75 ] . In vivo , treatment with COV2 - 2196 and COV2 - 2130 , individually or in combination , has been found to prophylactically protect AdV - hACE2 – transduced mice from infection with wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 ; these mice exhibited no weight loss and had reduced viral titers and in ﬂ ammation in the lung . Prophylactic and therapeutic combined treatment with COV2 - 2196 and COV2 - 2130 has been shown to improve protection against authentic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in AdV - hACE2 - transduced mice and protect wild - type mice from infection by a mouse - adapted SARS - CoV - 2 variant [ 75 ] . Hamsters and NHPs treated prophylactically or therapeutically with REGN - COV2 , a combination of REGN10987 and REGN10933 , exhibit a reduction in viral load and pathology [ 78 ] . Despite these promising results , the combinatorial concentrations of nAbs required for in vivo protection against SARS - CoV - 2 infection still need to be optimized for individual nAbs . Neutralizing antibodies targeting other regions of the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein Although a large number of nAbs identi ﬁ ed to date target the SARS - CoV - 2 RBD and the NTD , several nAbs target other regions ( Table 1 ) [ 44 , 55 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 S2 - targeting antibodies have been identi ﬁ ed ; however , the majority of them have no neutralizing activity . For example , among the 0304 - 3H3 , 9A1 , L19 , P008 _ 004 , P008 _ 005 , P008 _ 006 , P008 _ 016 , P008 _ 023 , and P008 _ 032 anti - bodies that bind to the SARS - CoV - 2 S2 fragment , only L19 neutralizes infection by SARS - CoV - 2 , including variant strains ( D614G and B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) and the wild - type strain [ 53 , 55 , 62 ] . Several of these SARS - CoV - 2 S2 - targeting antibodies also cross - react with SARS - CoV - 1 S protein , but none of them show neutralizing activity against SARS - CoV - 1 infection [ 53 ] . In addition , nAbs binding to the S - trimer and other regions have been identi ﬁ ed . For instance , the nAbs 2 - 43 and 2 - 51 bind to the SARS - CoV - 2 S - trimer complex , recognizing non - NTD and non - RBD epitope ( s ) [ 44 ] . Other nAbs ( such as I21 , J13 , D14 , I15 , F10 , F20 , and P008 _ 060 ) bind to the S - trimer complex and / or non - RBD S1 proteins and are capable of neutralizing wild - type and / or the aforementioned variants in vitro [ 53 , 62 ] . In general , the binding af ﬁ nity and neutralizing activity of non - RBD and non - NTD epitope - speci ﬁ c nAbs against SARS - CoV - 2 infection are lower than those of nAbs targeting the S protein NTD or RBD of SARS - CoV - 2 . It appears that no nAbs targeting non - NTD or non - RBD regions have yet been tested for protection against SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vivo . It is worth noting that the structures of a few nAbs targeting the non - NTD and non - RBD regions of the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein have been solved [ 44 ] . Identi ﬁ cation of neutralizing epitopes outside the S protein NTD and RBD regions of SARS - CoV - 2 is expected to lead to the design of novel and effective COVID - 19 therapeutics and vaccines based on these epitopes . Neutralizing antibodies targeting other SARS - CoV - 2 proteins Only a few monoclonal antibodies developed to date target other proteins of SARS - CoV - 2 , and most do not have neutralizing activity against SARS - CoV - 2 infection . However , they can be used for other applications , such as diagnosis and epidemiology . For example , monoclonal antibodies speci ﬁ cally targeting the SARS - CoV - 2 N protein increase the detection sensitivity of ELISAs , providing a tool for the early and accurate diagnosis based on clinical samples and for epidemiological studies of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 79 , 80 ] . In addition , the NP - monoclonal antibody system and related test strips can be utilized for large - scale screening of COVID - 19 samples [ 81 ] . Multimeric neutralizing antibodies targeting multiple regions of SARS - CoV - 2 proteins SARS - CoV - 2 nAbs can also be constructed by combining two or more neutralizing antibodies speci ﬁ c to SARS - CoV - 2 proteins and / or antibody fusion with the receptor ACE2 . The resultant multi - meric ( dimeric , trimeric , or tetravalent ) nAbs may bind to their respective regions with neutralizing activity . A dimeric nAb , 89C8 - ACE2 , was designed by combining the SARS - CoV - 2 NTD - targeting mAb 89C8 and the ACE2 ectodomain [ 61 ] . This nAb binds to the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein RBD , inhibiting the S1 – ACE2 interaction ; it also neutralizes pseudotyped and authentic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in vitro . Neutralizing antibodies to prevent and treat COVID - 19 in humans A variety of non – SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c nAbs , such as anti - CD6 ( itolizumab ) , anti - IL - 6 receptor ( tocilizumab ) , anti - IL17A ( ixekizu - mab ) , and anti - C5 complement antibodies , have been used in patients with COVID - 19 , with the purpose of reducing or eliminating SARS - CoV - 2 – induced cytokine storms and in ﬂ amma - tory responses or treating SARS - CoV - 2 – related pneumonia [ 54 , 82 – 93 ] . By comparison , only a few SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c human nAbs , including REGN - COV2 , LY - CoV555 , LY - CoV016 , AZD7442 , AGD20 , 47D11 , 2B04 , and CT - P59 , have been tested in clinical trials and / or approved for emergency use to prevent and / or treat COVID - 19 disease in humans [ 94 – 98 ] . Almost all of the nAbs under clinical trials target the RBD of SARS - CoV - 2 . L . Du et al . 2301 Cellular & Molecular Immunology ( 2021 ) 18 : 2293 – 2306 REGN - COV2 , a cocktail of two SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs , REGN10933 ( casirivimab ) and REGN10987 ( imdevimab ) , has been studied in a phase 1 – 3 clinical trial for outpatients with COVID - 19 , and the treatment resulted in reduced viral load without notable safety problems [ 94 ] . A phase 3 trial with subcutaneous administration of this nAb combination showed prevention of COVID - 19 progression from asymptomatic to symptomatic disease in early SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 99 ] . In addition , patients with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 exhibited reduced hospital utilization after receiving REGN - COV2 treatment within a few days of symptom onset , and a low - dose REGN - COV2 infusion has been shown to improve COVID - 19 symptoms [ 100 , 101 ] . In addition to treatment , REGN - COV2 has been tested for the possibility of preventing SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Subcutaneously injected REGN - COV2 pre - vented SARS - CoV - 2 infection and the presence of COVID - 19 symptoms in high - risk individuals who had close contact with SARS - CoV - 2 - infected persons [ 102 ] . LY - CoV555 , an RBD - speci ﬁ c nAb also known as LY3819253 or bamlanivimab , has been evaluated in treating outpatients with COVID - 19 , and a phase 2 trial of bamlanivimab concluded that it decreased the viral load in these patients [ 95 , 103 ] . In a phase 2 / 3 clinical trial , combinatorial treatment with bamlanivimab and another RBD - speci ﬁ c nAb , LY - CoV016 ( also known as LY3832479 , etesevimab , or CB6 ) , reduced the viral load in nonhospitalized patients with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 illness , whereas there was no signi ﬁ cant reduction in the viral load with monotherapy bamlanivimab treatment [ 97 ] . However , when coinjected with remdesivir , bamlanivimab does not exhibit therapeutic ef ﬁ ciency in patients hospitalized with COVID - 19 [ 104 ] . As prophylactic prevention , bamlanivimab has been shown to reduce the incidence of COVID - 19 among residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in a randomized phase 3 trial [ 105 ] . Clinical trials based on other SARS - CoV - 2 RBD - targeting nAbs are ongoing . A phase 3 trial ( NCT04723394 ) was conducted for coadministration with AZD7442 ( a nAb combination of AZD8895 + AZD1061 ) to assess its safety and ef ﬁ cacy for the treatment of outpatient adults with COVID - 19 and prevention of severe COVID - 19 or death . Two additional phase 3 trials ( NCT04625725 and NCT04625972 ) are planned to evaluate the safety and ef ﬁ cacy of preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis of this mAb combination in adults with COVID - 19 . In addition , a phase 2 / 3 trial ( NCT04859517 ) has recruited to determine the ef ﬁ cacy and safety of the nAb AGD20 in the prevention ( preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis ) of COVID - 19 , and a phase 2 / 3 trial ( NCT04805671 ) is planned to evaluate the ef ﬁ cacy and safety of this nAb in treating ambulatory participants with mild or moderate COVID - 19 . 47D11 and 2B04 nAbs have been used as monotherapy or combinatorial therapy in a phase 1 trial ( NCT04644120 ) to evaluate their safety , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics in adults with COVID - 19 , whereas the nAb CT - 59 has been applied in a phase 2 / 3 trial ( NCT04602000 ) to evaluate its therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy and safety in outpatients with mild - to - moderate symptoms of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Currently , bamlanivimab , etesevimab , and REGN - COV2 have been approved via Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) by the U . S . FDA for the therapeutic treatment of mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 in adults and pediatric patients ( ≥ 12 years of age ) from high - risk populations [ 106 – 109 ] . Moreover , the EUA also limits the use of these nAbs to treat only individuals who are hospitalized due to COVID - 19 or other health concerns . Potential challenges and improvement of SARS - CoV - 2 - speci ﬁ c nAbs Similar to other coronaviruses , including SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS - CoV , SARS - CoV - 2 has continually developed mutations during the COVID - 19 pandemic , and different mutants have been found in all four structural proteins and other viral proteins [ 110 ] . Multiple strains that are variants of concern ( VOCs ) ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , P . 1 , and B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) have been identi ﬁ ed that carry single or combined amino acid mutations or deletions , including K417N / T , E484K , N501Y , L452R , and T478K in the RBD ; L18F , T20N , P26S , 69 - 70del , D138Y , 144del , 156 - 157del , R158G , R190S , and 241 - 243del in the NTD ; and D614G in S1 of the S protein [ 111 , 112 ] . In addition , variant of interest ( VOI ) strains ( B . 1 . 427 , B . 1 . 429 , B . 1 . 525 , B . 1 . 526 , B . 1 . 617 . 1 , B . 1 . 617 . 3 , and P . 2 ) have also been de ﬁ ned , which carry mutations , such as L452R , S477N , E484K , and E484Q in the RBD ; 69 - 70del , T95I , G142D , 144del , W152C , E154K , F157S , and D253G in the NTD ; and D614G in S1 of the S protein [ 111 , 112 ] . Among these variants , P . 1 and P . 2 belong to the B . 1 . 1 . 28 lineage . These VOC and VOI strains may exhibit enhanced viral replication and / or transmission . Furthermore , other mutations that could cause escape from antibody recognition have been found in the S protein RBD or NTD regions through mapping , recombinant chimeric VSV / SARS - CoV - 2 reporter viruses , polyclonal human plasmas antibodies , and other approaches [ 113 – 115 ] . Mutations in the SARS - CoV - 2 RBD or NTD may lead to escape from antibody recognition and decreased neutralizing activity of nAbs against virus infection [ 113 ] . Many of the currently available nAbs speci ﬁ c to the prototypic SARS - CoV - 2 , including those targeting the NTD or RBD of the S protein , have reduced neutralizing activity against newly emer - ging SARS - CoV - 2 variants with substitutions in the NTD or RBD , particularly when they are used alone [ 41 , 116 – 120 ] . For example , the RBD - targeting nAbs 2 - 15 and C121 exhibit a complete loss of neutralizing activity against the P . 1 variant [ 121 ] . Neutralization of the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant by the RBD - targeting nAbs COVA2 - 15 , COVA1 - 18 , and S309 has also been found to be reduced , which might be potentially due to the N501Y mutation [ 119 ] ; nevertheless , this mutation has minimal effect on the neutralizing activity of the nAbs IgG ab1 and V H - Fc ab8 [ 122 ] . In contrast to RBD - speci ﬁ c nAb ab6 , which can neutralize a pseudotyped SARS - CoV - 2 variant containing a triple mutation ( K417N , E484K , N501Y ) , the nAbs COV2 - 2196 , COV2 - 3025 , COV2 - 2381 , and S2E12 exhibit reduced neutralizing ability against the B . 1 . 351 variant containing the E484K and N501Y mutations [ 117 , 123 ] . Notably , the RBD - targeting nAbs COV2 - 2050 , 1B07 , COVOX - 384 , and S2H58 exhibit loss of neutralizing activity against the Wash SA - B . 1 . 351 variant containing the full S sequence of the South African strain [ 117 ] . In addition , the NTD - speci ﬁ c nAbs COV2 - 2676 and COVD - 2489 also exhibit loss of neutralizing activity against the Wash SA - B . 1 . 351 variant [ 117 ] . Other NTD - speci ﬁ c nAbs , such as 5 - 24 and 4 - 8 , show completely abolished neutralizing activity against the B . 1 . 351 variant , whereas the 159 nAb exhibits reduced neutralizing ability against the P . 1 variant , potentially due to the mutations in the residues recognized by this nAb ( L18F , T20N , P26S , D138Y , and R190S ) [ 121 , 124 ] . Notably , clinically approved RBD - targeting nAbs , including LY - CoV555 , LY - CoV016 , REGN10933 , and AZD8895 , exhibit abolished neutralizing activity against the SARS - CoV - 2 P . 1 , B . 1 . 351 , or B . 1 . 1 . 7 VOCs in vitro [ 121 , 124 ] . This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that these nAbs are sensitive to mutations at residues 417 , 484 , and / or 501 of the SARS - CoV - 2 RBD [ 124 , 125 ] . In addition , LY - CoV555 and its combination with LY - CoV016 have been shown to exhibit reduced or loss of protective activity against VOCs , including B . 1 . 351 and / or B . 1 . 128 , in hACE2 - Tg mouse models [ 125 ] . A combination of clinically trialed nAbs , 2B04 / 47D11 , have been shown to have decreased protective ef ﬁ cacy against the B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , and B . 1 . 128 variant strains in hACE2 - Tg mice , and the protection was dose - dependent [ 125 ] . Apparently , the loss of neutralizing activity or protection by clinically approved nAbs against SARS - CoV - 2 VOC strains will signi ﬁ cantly affect the clinical use of these nAbs to treat COVID - 19 patients , particularly when persons are infected with variants carrying related mutations . It is plausible to identify the neutralizing activity of nAbs approved via EUA against all potential VOC and VOI variants , test their L . Du et al . 2302 Cellular & Molecular Immunology ( 2021 ) 18 : 2293 – 2306 combinatorial effects with other appropriate nAbs , or optimize injection dosages before use for clinical treatment of COVID - 19 patients . nAbs are engineered or fused to improve neutralizing activity to prevent and treat infection caused by SARS - CoV - 2 mutant strains . Remarkably , combinatorial nAbs can be constructed by fusing the heavy chain ( HC ) of one nAb with the engineered light chain ( LC ) of another nAb targeting conserved epitopes on the NTD , RBD , or S2 regions of the S protein of multiple SARS - CoV - 2 strains . It has been shown that the RBD - targeting nAb 222 with somatic mutations at the LC ( 222LC ) maintains neutralizing activity against P . 1 , B . 1 . 1 . 7 , and B . 1 . 351 variants and that a chimeric nAb ( 150HC / 222LC ) fused to the LC of the nAb 222 with the HC of another RBD - targeting nAb ( 150 ) restores or improves neutralization potency of the naive nAb against these SARS - CoV - 2 VOC strains [ 124 ] . In addition , cocktail treatments combining nAbs recognizing epitopes on the NTD , RBD , or S2 or different epitopes on the same fragments are expected to exhibit synergistic effects and reduce the prevalence of antibody escape mutants , potentially improving nAb ef ﬁ cacy in preventing COVID - 19 . Indeed , NTD - targeting nAbs may neutralize mutant viruses that exhibit RBD - targeting antibody escape , and vice versa [ 54 ] . A combination of RBD - and NTD - targeting nAbs limits the development of escape mutants [ 126 ] . In addition , combinations of two RBD - targeting nAbs ( such as REGN10933 and REGN10987 ) , particularly three noncompeting RBD - speci ﬁ c nAbs ( such as REGN10933 , REGN10987 , and REGN10985 ) , improve the ef ﬁ ciency of individual nAbs in neutralizing SARS - CoV - 2 VOC and VOI strains , preventing the development of escape mutants [ 127 ] . Moreover , treatment of hACE2 - Tg mice , 129S2 immunocompetent mice , and hamsters with combinations of RBD - targeting nAbs , such as S309 / S2E12 , COV2 - 2130 / COV2 - 2196 , and / or REGN10933 / REGN10987 , prevents infection with multiple SARS - CoV - 2 variants , including B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , B . 1 . 128 , and SARS - CoV - 2 containing N501Y / D614G muta - tions [ 125 ] . Crystal and cryo - EM structural analyses of the binding between nAbs and the SARS - CoV - 2 S protein , its functional fragments , or other proteins provide an effective tool to rapidly identify novel and conserved neutralizing epitopes across SARS - CoV - 2 variants , which will allow for the design of innovative countermeasures . CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS The global COVID - 19 pandemic has promoted rapid development and human testing of nAbs to prevent and treat SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Among all of the SARS - CoV - 2 proteins , S , particularly its RBD fragment , is the major target for the development of potent COVID - 19 nAbs , and nAbs targeting this region are generally more potent than those targeting other regions , including the NTD . Most of these nAbs have been evaluated preclinically and exhibit neutralizing activity against SARS - CoV - 2 in vitro and / or prophy - lactic or therapeutic protection of animals from SARS - CoV - 2 challenge . Some of these nAbs also prevent infection or can be used to treat SARS - CoV - 2 - infected individuals . Nevertheless , the emergence of mutations in the antibody target regions , particu - larly in the S protein RBD , combined with the presence of antibody escape variants , makes it essential to design monovalent and multivalent nAbs or nAb cocktails with improved neutralizing activity and protective ef ﬁ cacy . Moreover , it would be advanta - geous to generate large amounts of monoclonal antibodies with relatively low cost for clinical use . Hopefully , new nAbs with broad - spectrum neutralizing activity against multiple SARS - CoV - 2 variants and escape mutant strains will be developed , and more cost - effective manufacturing practices will be established . Ideally , these nAbs will provide safe and effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents that can be used to prevent and treat infection caused by current SARS - CoV - 2 strains and future variants that may develop .
