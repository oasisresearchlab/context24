At least four putative sensors have recently been proposed to trigger the HSR . They include a plasma membrane channel that initiates an inward calcium ﬂux , a histone sensor in the nucleus , and two unfolded protein sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum and the cytosol . Each of these putative sensors is thought to activate a similar set of HSR genes leading to enhanced thermotolerance , but the relationship be - tween the different pathways and their hierarchical or - der is unclear . In this review , we explore the possible involvement of different thermosensors in the plant response to warming and heat stress . Why is it important to study heat stress in plants ? Temperature is one of the key physical parameters affect - ing life on Earth . As a result , almost all living organisms have evolved signaling pathways to sense mild changes in ambient temperature and adjust their metabolism and cell function to prevent heat - related damage . Indeed , many features of the heat stress response ( HSR ) pathway are conserved among both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organ - isms [ 1 , 2 ] . The HSR pathway has been extensively studied in plants [ 3 – 8 ] , but many questions remain unanswered . Heat stress can have an adverse impact on almost all aspects of plant development , growth , reproduction and yield [ 9 – 14 ] . Because plants are sessile organisms that cannot escape heat , they are forced to invest valuable resources in modifying their metabolism to prevent damage caused by heat , in a process generally referred to as acclimation . Alternatively , plants can activate pro - grammed cell death in speciﬁc cells or tissues , a process that can lead to the shedding of leaves , the abortion of ﬂower or fruit formation , or even death of the entire plant [ 15 – 20 ] ( Figure 1 ) . Testimony to the severity of heat stress effects on plant growth and reproduction lies in the 1980 and 1988 US heat waves , which resulted in overall damages to agricultural production estimated at 55 and 71 billion dollars , respectively , and had a devastating economical and sociological impact [ 9 , 11 , 14 ] . Over the past three decades ( 1980 – 2008 ) , heat stress has caused a de - crease of 5 . 5 % and 3 . 8 % in the world yields of wheat and maize , respectively [ 14 ] . Although all plant tissues are susceptible to heat stress , the reproductive tissues are especially sensitive to heat waves , and a few degrees elevation in temperature during ﬂowering time can result in the loss of entire grain crop cycles [ 9 , 21 ] . Therefore , dissecting the HSR of plants and identifying key compo - nents of the heat stress sensing and signal transduction pathway are a high priority and could result in the devel - opment of plants and crops with enhanced tolerance to heat stress [ 9 ] . The development of plants with enhanced heat tolerance is also crucial in light of the current and anticipated climate changes , which are predicted to cause a gradual increase in ambient temperature and to enhance the frequency and amplitude of heat episodes [ 9 , 10 ] . How does heat stress affect plants ? Heat stress differentially affects the stability of various proteins , membranes , RNA species and cytoskeleton struc - tures , and alters the efﬁciency of enzymatic reactions in the cell , causing a state of metabolic imbalance [ 22 – 24 ] . Because most cellular reactions are coupled , disrupting the steady - state ﬂux of metabolites can cause the accumu - lation of toxic by - products , such as reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . Indeed , an intimate relationship exists between oxidative stress and the HSR in many organisms [ 22 – 27 ] . To counter the effects of heat stress on cellular metabolism , plants and other organisms respond to changes in their ambient temperature by reprogramming their transcriptome , proteome , metabolome and lipidome ; that is , by altering their composition of certain transcripts , proteins , metabolites and lipids ( Figure 1 ) . Such changes are aimed at establishing a new steady - state balance of metabolic processes that can enable the organism to Review Glossary Brassinosteroids : a group of plant steroid hormones that regulate growth , development and responses to different environmental stresses . bZIP : a family of TFs that contain a basic leucine zipper ( bZIP ) domain and regulate many central developmental and physiological processes in plants , such as photomorphogenesis , energy homeostasis , and abiotic and biotic stress responses .

Of course , a reverse process of deprogramming is required when the temperature shifts back to normal levels . Although members of the main families of molecular chaperones , such as the heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) HSP100s , HSP90s , HSP70s , HSP60s , HSP40s and the small HSPs ( sHSPs ) , play a key role in mitigating the effects of heat stress on plant metabolism [ 28 – 31 ] , the majority of transcripts upregulated in cells in response to heat do not encode molecular chaperones ( Box 1 ) . In fact , the plant HSR is thought to be mediated by multiple pathways , which are orchestrated by a selected group of regulatory proteins , and is triggered by one or more temperature sensors ( Figure 1 ) . What types of heat response exist in plants ? Various treatments have been used to study heat response in plants , the most common of which is to subject plants growing under controlled conditions to an episode of severe heat stress . In Arabidopsis thaliana , for example , this entails subjecting plants growing at 21 8 C to an abrupt 42 – 45 8 C treatment for a period of 0 . 5 – 1 h .

A schematic model for temperature sensing in plants . Increases in ambient temperature affect many different processes . Mild changes in temperature can alter membrane properties and activate a calcium channel . The inward flux of calcium that follows is thought to activate signal transduction events and alter plant metabolism in a process called acclimation . This pathway ( highlighted in yellow and linked by solid arrows ) may serve as the primary heat sensing mechanism of plants . Additional temperature - induced changes include alterations in protein stability and exposure of hydrophobic residues of proteins that may trigger the UPR sensors in the cytosol and the ER , histone eviction in the nucleus [ which clears the way for TF binding to HSR genes ( nuclear sensor ) ] , accumulation of ROS and alteration in cellular energy levels , and unfolding of RNA species that could act as riboswitches or affect spliceosome and microRNAs function . These pathways , ( indicated in light turquoise , ) are thought to trigger different signal transduction events and contribute to plant heat acclimation . An alternative to acclimation is the activation of programmed cell death , which could be triggered based on a compilation of different signal transduction pathways and conditions . The activation of calcium signaling by the PM channel is thought to allow the triggering of other sensor - derived pathways via the signal transduction box . Box 1 . What are the components of the HSR in plants ? About 5 % of the plant transcriptome is upregulated twofold or more in response to heat stress [ 3 , 33 , 77 , 80 ] . Only a fraction of these transcripts encode heat - induced chaperones : 88 out of 1780 in A . thaliana , and 117 out of 1509 in wheat [ 33 , 80 ] . The rest of the transcripts encode products involved in calcium signaling , protein phosphorylation , phytohormone signaling , sugar and lipid signaling and metabolism , RNA metabolism , translation , primary and second - ary metabolisms , transcription regulation and responses to different biotic and abiotic stresses . Heat - induced chaperones , although often massively induced by heat stress , are therefore only a minor component of the overall HSR of plants . Nevertheless , mutants lacking different heat - induced chaperones display reduced survival in response to heat stress [ 28 – 31 ] . Heat - induced chaperones belong to the larger family of molecular chaperones that are either constitutively expressed in non - stressed cells or induced at particular developmental stages , or more commonly by different environmental challenges . Under physiologi - cal conditions they control cellular signaling , protein folding , translocation and degradation , whereas under heat stress they prevent protein misfolding and aggregation and may protect membranes [ 81 ] . One of the regulatory networks that control the expression of chaperones is the HSF network , with 21 members in A . thaliana [ 7 ] . The regulation can be achieved by a single ‘master switch’ HSF ( e . g . HSFA1 in tomato [ 82 ] ) , or by the collective function of several HSFs ( e . g . HSFA1a to HSFA1e in A . thaliana [ 35 ] ) . HSF activity can be regulated at the transcriptional , post - transcriptional and post - transla - tional levels , including the dissociation of inhibitory chaperones , various degrees of phosphorylation and other post - translational modifications such as sumoylation . These post - translational modifica - tions can cause HSFs to oligomerize [ 78 ] , translocate to the nucleus , bind to the promoters of HSR genes [ 83 ] and recruit histone acetyltransferase HAC1 [ 7 ] , thereby indirectly contributing to the decreased occupancy of HSR gene promoters by inhibitory histones . The importance of HSR pathways outside the chaperone network has been demonstrated in mutants lacking the transcriptional factor MBF1c , in which the ethylene , salicylic acid and trehalose signaling pathways were affected [ 32 , 60 ] . The HSR therefore includes multiple pathways that may be redundant , depending upon the presence of an acclimation period , different environmental conditions and / or the developmental stage of the plant . Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences March 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 3 119 of plants to respond and successfully acclimate to such treatment is generally referred to as basal thermotolerance , and is assayed by measuring plant survival 5 – 7 days fol - lowing the severe heat stress episode ( Figure 2a ) [ 3 , 32 ] . The second type of treatment involves subjecting plants to a moderate level of heat stress ( called ‘priming’ ) , letting them recover for a few hours , and then subjecting them to an abrupt episode of severe heat stress . In A . thaliana , such treatment involves subjecting plants growing at 21 8 C to a 36 – 38 8 C treatment for a period of 1 . 5 h , letting them recover at 21 8 C for 2 h and then subjecting them to increas - ingly longer periods of severe heat stress ( 45 8 C ) , as de - scribed above ( Figure 2a ) [ 3 , 33 ] . The ability of plants to survive such treatment is generally referred to as acquired thermotolerance . Priming for acquired thermotolerance can also be induced in A . thaliana by a slow and continuous rise in temperature ( Figure 2a ) [ 3 ] . Such a gradual rise in temperature , which best mimics natural conditions , is much more effective in inducing acquired thermotolerance than the artiﬁcial and abrupt treatment described above ( Figure 2a and Supplementary Table S1 ) . The successful acclimation of A . thaliana seedlings to a noxious heat stress at 45 8 C correlates with a massive accumulation of certain transcripts during the previous abrupt or gradual priming stages ; most of these transcripts encode different molecular chaperones such as the sHSPs and HSP70s , as well as ROS and redox response enzymes , such as ascorbate peroxidase ( APX ) ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . The accumulation of most of these transcripts is much higher during the gradual priming treatment , which translates into a net gain of 1 - h survival of the plants following the noxious heat condi - tion ( Figure 2a and Supplementary Table S1 ) . Certain regulatory and acclimation proteins , such as the transcriptional regulator MBF1c ( see Glossary ) or the ROS detoxifying enzyme catalase , are required for basal ther - motolerance but not for acquired thermotolerance [ 32 , 34 ] . By contrast , some heat shock transcription factors ( HSFs ) , as well as the disaggregating chaperone HSP101 , seem to be required for both responses [ 28 , 35 ] . Differences between acquired and basal thermotolerance were revealed in a study in wheat that identiﬁed 1314 transcripts differen - tially expressed between heat treatments with or without preacclimation [ 33 ] . 4 2 0 6 25 30 35 40 45 50 T e m pe r a t u r e ( ° C ) Temperature ( °C ) Key : Survival ( % ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 8 S u r v i v a l ( % ) No priming ( a ) ( b ) 8 6 4 2 0 25 30 35 40 45 50 T e m pe r a t u r e ( ° C ) Time ( hours ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 S u r v i v a l ( % ) Gradual priming 8 6 4 2 0 25 30 35 40 45 50 T e m pe r a t u r e ( ° C ) 0 20 40 60 80 100 S u r v i v a l ( % ) Stepwise priming Log2 f o l d i ndu c t i on 1607 308 2456 Acquired thermotolerance Adaptation Heat sensor Warm sensor Priming heat - shock Physiological temperatures 2 4 6 8 10 12 2 4 6 8 10 12 Genes Warming Heating Log2 f o l d i ndu c t i on Genes T i BS Figure 2 . Different warming and heating pretreatments determine the effectiveness of plant thermo - adaptation and acquired thermotolerance . ( a ) Plant survival to a noxious heat stress correlates with a massive upregulation of chaperones and ROS response genes during a prestress heat - priming treatment . A schematic representation ( redrawn from [ 3 ] ) is shown of treatments designed to measure either basal thermotolerance ( no priming ) , acquired thermotolerance ( stepwise priming ) or acquired thermotolerance by way of a gradual increase in temperature ( gradual priming ) . Red lines are the temperature regimes . Blue lines are the percentage survival of the Arabidopsis seedlings measured 5 days after the heat treatments . Arrows indicate the time point before the noxious 45 8 C heat stress at which mRNA was collected for microarray analysis . The online Supplementary Table S1 presents a list of the most upregulated transcripts following a stepwise or gradual heat priming , compared to no priming , at T = 6 h ( indicated by an arrow in panel a ) . ( b ) Top : distribution and fold - expression level of transcripts that accumulate in response to warming ( left ) or heating ( right ) in A . thaliana . Microarray probes corresponding to bioinformatically predicted chaperones [ 77 ] are indicated in black . Microarray data for warming and heat treatments were extracted from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) under accession numbers GSE18624 [ 36 ] and GSE16222 [ 78 ] , respectively . To obtain transcript fold change for warming , the mean of the absolute units corresponding to the two technical replicates obtained at 27 8 C was divided by the mean of the absolute units from two technical replicates at 12 8 C . The logarithms of obtained quotients ( y axis ) were plotted against the corresponding genes ( x axis ) . Similarly , for the heat transcriptome profile , the mean of the absolute units corresponding to the two technical replicates obtained at 38 8 C was divided by the mean of the absolute units from two technical replicates at 23 8 C . The logarithms of the obtained quotients ( y axis ) were plotted against corresponding genes ( x axis ) using MS Excel . To obtain black labels for the chaperones in the graph , only the values for upregulated ‘chaperome’ transcripts were added as separate column in MS Excel and plotted as an overlay . Middle : a Venn diagram showing the degree of overlap between warming , left [ 36 ] and heat response transcripts , right [ 79 ] that are elevated twofold or more in A . thaliana . Bottom : a schematic model proposing the existence of two independent sensors , one for warming that would work within physiologically relevant temperatures , and one for heat stress that would be involved in acquired thermotolerance . Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences March 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 3 120 A different type of heat treatment should be referred to as mere ‘warming’ ( Figure 2b ) [ 36 ] . In this treatment , plants are kept at a temperature that is lower than the normal growth temperature ( e . g . 12 8 C instead of 21 8 C for A . thaliana ) and are then transferred to a physiological temperature that is slightly above their normal growth temperature ( 27 8 C instead of 21 8 C ) . Because 27 8 C is not a damaging heat stress for most plants and does not trigger the expression of many HSR markers [ 36 ] , this treatment cannot be considered a heat stress treatment . As shown in Figure 2b , the transcriptome response of A . thaliana to warming is remarkably different from that of a simple heat stress treatment ( e . g . heating from 22 8 C to 37 8 C ) , sug - gesting that different heat sensors , as well as distinct signaling pathways , are involved in the activation of these two plant responses to a temperature rise . In contrast to HSR priming , which leads to a relatively short - term accli - mation and acquired thermotolerance [ 3 ] , warming seems to result in longer - term adaptation of plants to warmer growth conditions and can include developmental repro - gramming , such as shedding leaves or early ﬂowering [ 36 ] . The differences in transcriptome footprints between warm - ing and heat stress ( Figure 2b ) , as well as the differences in protein requirements and transcriptome expression be - tween basal and acquired thermotolerance [ 32 , 33 ] , strong - ly suggest that different pathways and , importantly , different thermosensors are involved in triggering the different thermal responses in plants . How do plants sense heat ? When an A . thaliana leaf is exposed to a rise in ambient temperature , its large surface - to - volume ratio ensures that almost all macromolecules in the cells , such as protein complexes , membranes and nucleic acid polymers , ‘per - ceive’ the heat simultaneously . The increased kinetic movement of these macromolecules is expected to concom - itantly cause reversible physical changes , such as in - creased membrane ﬂuidity , partial melting of DNA and RNA strands , protein subunit dissociation and exposure of protein hydrophobic cores ( Figure 1 ) . Therefore , all macro - molecules might , in principle , serve as thermosensors by providing an output in the form , for example , of a transient loss of function [ 4 ] . Yet , to properly answer the question ‘How do plants feel the heat ? ’ , we need to identify which among the many heat - responsive macromolecules in the plant cell acts as a primary heat sensor . This sensor must be able to not only precisely perceive and differentially react to various temperature increments but also differen - tially trigger a unique signaling pathway that can speciﬁ - cally upregulate hundreds of HSR genes ( Figures 1 and 2 , and Supplementary Table S1 ) . The sensing of heat stress in plants could be mediated by different routes ( Figure 1 ) . The speciﬁc sensor molecule could be directly affected by heat , for example due to temperature - induced changes in its quaternary and tertia - ry structures . Alternatively , the sensor molecule could be indirectly affected by heat due to the effects of heat on other components of the cell . For example , a membrane protein might be affected by heat via temperature - induced changes in membrane ﬂuidity . Heat - related changes in plant metabolism , such as altered metabolic ﬂuxes , accumulation of ROS , release of ATP from cells , or reduced energy levels could also activate the heat sensor molecule . Energy depletion in A . thaliana is sensed via a pathway that involves SNF1 - related protein kinase ( SnRK1 ) [ 37 ] . Sensing of heat stress could also be mediated by the detection of unfolded proteins or RNAs in the cell [ 4 , 22 , 23 ] . In the classical model for heat stress activation , the presence of heat stress - induced unfolded proteins in the cell causes molecular chaperones to be released from their constitutive inhibitory association with HSF mono - mers [ 38 ] and to bind the unfolded proteins , while the free HSFs subunits trimerize , undergo phosphorylation , bind to HSR promoters and activate the HSR [ 7 ] . Although this model may function in certain cells or organisms , heat stress sensing in plants , especially at temperatures that do not unfold proteins , is much more complicated and could involve multiple pathways present in different compart - ments of the cell . In the next section , we summarize some of the new ﬁndings as they pertain to the sensing of heat in plants . Sensing heat at the plasma membrane The primary sensing event of heat stress in the moss Physcomitrella patens occurs at the plasma membrane ( PM ) [ 39 , 40 ] . A combination of electrophysiology , reporter gene assays and biochemical measurements [ 39 ] revealed that mild increases in temperature are sensed at the PM , lead to the opening of a speciﬁc calcium channel that triggers an inﬂux of calcium into the cell , and activate the HSR . The suppression of this pathway by calcium channel blockers or chelators indicates that the calcium channel that triggers the heat - induced calcium inﬂux serves as one of the primary heat sensors of plants ( Figure 1 ) . Because membrane properties are altered by heat stress and can adapt to different growth temperatures [ 41 – 44 ] , and because chemicals that ﬂuidize the membrane can induce the PM calcium - dependent HSR in the absence of a change in temperature [ 39 , 40 ] , the membrane calcium channel is probably activated by a temperature - induced increase in ﬂuidity of the PM [ 39 ] . Although the identity of the PM heat stress sensor in plants is unknown , studies in animal cells have indicated that some ion channels – such as stromal interaction molecule ( STIM ) , members of the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V ( TRPV ) and cyclic nucleotide - gated channels ( CNGCs ) – might function as temperature sensors [ 45 – 48 ] . The A . thaliana genome encodes over 40 putative calcium chan - nels , many of which are probably located in the PM and might serve as heat sensors [ 49 ] . Interestingly , many can - didate channels display a cytosolic C - terminus with a puta - tive calmodulin - binding domain , raising the possibility that a speciﬁc calmodulin may be involved in the ensuing steps of the heat stress signaling pathway . The suppression of HSR pathways in higher plants by calcium channel blockers and chelators is an additional indication that PM calcium sig - naling plays a key role in heat stress signaling [ 50 – 52 ] . A heat stress - induced inward calcium ﬂux can regulate multiple signaling pathways in plants ( Figure 3 ) [ 53 ] . In A . thaliana , the calmodulin AtCaM3 is required for heat stress signaling [ 54 , 55 ] and may be involved in the activa - tion of different transcription factors ( TFs ) such as Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences March 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 3 121 WRKY39 [ 56 ] and HSFs [ 35 ] . In addition , an inward ﬂux of calcium activates several calcium - dependent protein kinases ( CDPKs ) , which can , in turn , activate multiple mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) [ 57 ] or the ROS - producing enzyme NADPH oxidase [ 58 ] . AtCaM3 can also activate calcium / calmodulin - binding protein ki - nase ( CBK ) , which phosphorylates HSFA1a , a member of the HSF family [ 55 ] , whereas the phosphatase PP7 depho - sphorylates HSFA1a [ 53 ] . An HSP90 / FKBP - dependent kinase ( ROF1 , also known as FKBP62 ) can also mediate HSF phosphorylation resulting from calcium binding to calmodulin [ 59 ] . Phosphorylation of the key transcriptional regulator of basal thermotolerance , MBF1c , which functions upstream to the dehydration - responsive element - binding ( DREB ) transcriptional activator and certain HSFs , may be a direct or indirect result of CDPK activation [ 60 , 61 ] . In addition to activating PM ion channels , heat - induced changes in membrane ﬂuidity might trigger lipid signal - ing . Heat stress results in the activation of phospholipase D ( PLD ) and phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase ( PIPK ) and the accumulation of various lipid signaling molecules such as phosphatidic acid , phosphatidylinosi - tol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) and D - myo - inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - tri - sphosphate ( IP 3 ) [ 62 ] . Moreover , a reduction of phospholipase C9 activity correlates directly with reduced IP 3 concentration , downregulation of sHSPs , and reduced thermotolerance [ 63 ] . The accumulation of lipid signaling molecules could in turn cause the opening of channels and the triggering of a calcium inﬂux . However , the relation - ship , if any , between the PM channels that are directly or indirectly activated by heat and the channels that are activated by lipid signaling in plants is unknown . In addi - tion , the order of events in the heat stress sensing and signaling response is poorly understood . Some of the sig - naling pathways that probably function downstream to heat stress sensing at the PM are summarized in Figure 3 . Unfolded protein response ( UPR ) in the ER and the cytosol The UPR is a signaling pathway activated in cells in response to stresses that impair protein stability in the endoplasmatic reticulum ( ER ) [ 15 , 64 ] . In plants , there seem to be at least two UPR pathways , one in the ER and the other in the cytosol [ 65 – 67 ] . The UPR can be activated by heat stress , by chemicals that cause the unfolding of proteins , or by different abiotic stresses such as changes in salinity or osmotic stress [ 15 ] . The activa - tion of the ER UPR pathway in plants involves the proteolytic cleavage and release of different bZIP TFs from the ER membrane [ 66 , 67 ] . The displaced TFs enter ?

Heat stress affects membrane stability and activates a PM calcium channel , resulting in an inward flux of calcium ( left ) . Changes in membrane stability could also trigger lipid signaling through the lipid - modifying enzymes PLD and PIPK . Calcium binds the calmodulin CaM3 and activates multiple kinases as well as transcriptional regulators of the HSR , such as HSFs , MBF1c , WRKY and DREB . Increased levels of cytosolic calcium also activate the ROS - producing enzyme RBOHD , located at the PM , by direct interaction or through activation of a CDPK that phosphorylates RBOHD ( lower left ) . RBOHD - derived ROS [ i . e . superoxide ( O 2 (cid:2) ) , which is converted to hydrogen peroxide H 2 O 2 ] can cause membrane depolarization , as well as enter cells and trigger the ROS / redox signaling network , which would in turn activate MBF1c and HSFs . ROS may also accumulate in cells during heat stress because of metabolic imbalances , and trigger the same network . Two UPR pathways are shown in the model , one in the cytosol ( Cyt - UPR ) and one in the ER ( ER - UPR ) . The Cyt - UPR functions through HSFs whereas the ER - UPR functions through the sensor molecule IRE1 and the transcription factors bZip17 , bZIP28 and bZIP60 . In the nucleus , warming decreases H2A . Z histone occupancy at HSP promoters ( right ) . Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences March 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 3 122 the nuclei and activate the transcription of speciﬁc genes , which leads to the accumulation of ER chaperone transcripts and the activation of brassinosteroid signal - ing [ 67 ] . An ER chaperone ( binding immunoglobulin protein , BiP ) and the sensor molecule IRE1 regulate the cleavage of the different bZIP proteins in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER [ 66 ] . In contrast to the ER UPR , the cytosolic UPR , which is triggered by the presence of unfolded proteins in the cytosol , is primarily regulated by an HSF , HSFA2 , which binds to HSF - binding elements in the promoters of HSR genes ( Box 1 ) [ 65 ] . The UPR may not be as sensitive as the calcium channel PM response because few unfolded proteins are expected to accumulate at low and mild heat stresses . Moreover , HSR chaperones can accumulate in plant cells under non - dena - turing temperatures and in the absence of heat stress [ 68 ] , and activation of the UPR seems to require speciﬁc calcium signals from the PM [ 39 ] , suggesting that the UPR is not the primary heat sensor in plants . Metabolic changes and ROS signaling Because different metabolic pathways probably depend on enzymes with different sensitivities to excessive heat , it has been suggested that heat stress might uncouple some metabolic pathways and cause the accumulation of un - wanted by - products , such as ROS , that could act as signals to trigger the HSR [ 69 , 70 ] . Nevertheless , ROS accumula - tion during heat stress is also an active response that is mediated by speciﬁc ROS - producing enzymes [ 25 ] . ROS accumulation can be triggered in tobacco cells by chemicals that alter membrane ﬂuidity , and heat stress - induced ROS accumulation can be blocked by an inhibitor of the ROS - producing enzyme NADPH oxidase [ 25 ] . Moreover , heat stress survival and heat stress signal transduction require respiratory burst oxidase homolog D ( RBOHD ) , a ROS - generating NADPH oxidase located in the PM [ 26 , 71 ] . The activities of this protein are regulated by phosphorylation via protein kinases such as CDPKs [ 58 ] , and by direct binding of calcium to certain RBOHD domains that face the cytosol [ 58 ] ( Figure 3 ) . Therefore , an inﬂux of calcium mediated by calcium channels at the PM could activate RBOHD and result in the accumulation of ROS . The accu - mulated ROS might in turn activate downstream pathways via MBF1c , certain HSFs , MAPKs and / or SnRKs , and might alter the redox state of the cell [ 27 , 69 ] . Moreover , because ROS accumulation at the PM outer surface can cause mem - brane depolarization [ 27 ] , calcium - induced RBOHD activation and ROS accumulation could amplify the HSR by opening additional calcium channels at the PM ( Figure 3 ) . RBOHD is required for rapid sensing of heat stress in A . thaliana , which suggests that ROS and calcium signaling are highly interlinked in the activation of the HSR [ 27 , 72 ] . In addition , ROS accumulation in cells can trigger programmed cell death [ 16 – 20 , 58 ] and may explain some aspects of HSR - induced programmed cell death in plants ( Figures 1 and 3 ) . Temperature - induced changes in histone occupancy A screen of A . thaliana mutants impaired in heat sensing identiﬁed the gene ARP6 as involved in mediating responses to temperature change [ 36 ] . ARP6 encodes a subunit of the SWR1 complex , which is necessary for insert - ing the alternative histone H2A . Z into nucleosomes , instead of H2A , and could be involved in temperature sensing [ 73 – 75 ] . Mutants lacking ARP6 have a reduced content of H2A . Z bound to their chromosomes . Interestingly , the transcriptome of arp6 null mutants grown at 12 8 C is similar to that of wild - type plants grown at 12 8 C and warmed to 27 8 C , suggesting that H2A . Z - containing nucleosomes can modulate transcription in a temperature - dependent man - ner [ 36 ] . Accordingly , in wild - type plants , warming induces a dramatic decrease in H2A . Z occupancy in nucleosomes located at the transcription start site of warming - induced genes , a process expected to allow for enhanced transcrip - tion of these genes . However , it is unclear whether this mechanism is also responsible for heat sensing during more classical HSR treatments that lead to acquired thermoto - lerance . In addition , as suggested by the authors [ 36 ] , the decreased occupancy of H2A . Z at certain HSP promoters in the arp6 mutant might also result in alteration in the expression or DNA binding of a speciﬁc TF or other regula - tory proteins , which would trigger the transcriptome response . It would be interesting to examine whether heat still decreases the occupancy of H2A . Z at promoters of HSP - encoding genes during heat stress when PM - controlled calcium entry is suppressed ( for example by EGTA ) . Concluding remarks In plants , changes in ambient temperature seem to be sensed via a complex network of molecular sensors located in different cell compartments ( Figures 1 and 3 ) . The sensors include a rapid PM sensing mechanism that trig - gers a speciﬁc inward calcium ﬂux , UPR sensors in the ER and the cytosol , and histone decreased occupancy in the nuclei ( Figure 3 ) . The signals generated by these different sensors are probably integrated by a signal transduction network that involves calcium ﬂuxes , calmodulin , CDPKs , MAPKs , phosphatases and transcriptional regulators . Known transcriptional regulators include the HSF net - work ( with 21 members in A . thaliana ) [ 7 ] , MBF1c [ 32 ] and different TFs of the WRKY , DREB and bZIP families [ 56 , 66 , 76 ] ( Figure 3 ) . The activation of the different path - ways may be tissue speciﬁc and , in particular , may differ between reproductive and vegetative tissues . Despite recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in heat stress sensing in plants , many questions remain unanswered ( Box 2 ) . Per - haps the most important question is : how are the different heat - sensing pathways integrated ? It is unknown if the triggering of one pathway is required for the activation of the others . The ﬁnding that blocking the inward calcium ﬂux in the moss P . patens results in blockage of the HSR suggests that other heat stress sensors of plants , such as the UPR pathways , may depend on the triggering of the PM pathway [ 39 ] . Is calcium signaling at the PM a master sensor for the HSR ? According to such a model , the initial sensing of heat stress would occur at the PM , and the calcium signaling events that follow would enable the activation of the UPR and / or the histone decreased occu - pancy response . It is also possible that additional path - ways await discovery . Review Trends in Biochemical Sciences March 2012 , Vol . 37 , No . 3 123 Because different biotic and abiotic signaling pathways use calcium for signaling [ 53 ] , it would also be interesting to ﬁnd out how heat stress sensing is integrated with the sensing of other stresses in plants [ 9 , 11 ] and how it main - tains its exquisite speciﬁcity . Additional studies using genetic screens and protein structure – function analysis , as well as advanced RNA , protein and lipid labeling and microscopy tools , are needed to resolve some of these and other questions pertaining to the sensing of heat stress in plants ( Box 2 ) .
