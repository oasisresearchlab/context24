Microrheology is the natural method of choice for such studies due to its economy in sample volume , its wide frequency range , and its spatial sensitivity . In microrheology , the thermal motion of tracer particles embedded in a complex ﬂuid is used to extract the ﬂuid’s viscoelastic properties . Comparing the motion of a single particle to the correlated motion of particle pairs , it is possible to extract viscoelastic properties at different length scales . In a recent study , a crossover between intermediate and bulk response of complex ﬂuids was discovered in microrheology measurements of reconstituted actin networks . This crossover length was related to structural and mechanical properties of the networks , such as their mesh size and dynamic correlation length . Here we capitalize on this result giving a detailed description of our analysis scheme , and demonstrating how this relation can be used to extract the dynamic correlation length of a polymer network . We further study the relation between the dynamic correlation length and the structure of the network , by introducing a new length scale , the average ﬁlament length , without altering the network’s mesh size . Contrary to the prevailing assumption , that the dynamic correlation length is equivalent to the mesh size of the network , we ﬁnd that the dynamic correlation length increases once the ﬁlament length is reduced below the crossover distance . PACS numbers : I . INTRODUCTION Complex ﬂuids are intriguing materials , both from the structural and the mechanical point of view . Comprised of at least two components , these ﬂuids contain mesoscopic struc - tural features on the scale of nanometers to millimeters [ 1 ] . As a result their mechanical response to perturbations is both elastic - like and ﬂuid - like in nature . Conventionally , complex ﬂuids are characterized mechanically by bulk rheology [ 2 ] . Complex ﬂuids of biological origin , which are not readily available in large quantities , are usually characterized using a more material economic technique , microrheology , which uses the motion of embedded tracer particles observed by op - tical microscopy to extract the material properties [ 3 – 9 ] . An - other advantage of microrheology is its ability to characterize the viscoelastic properties of these ﬂuids on different length scales [ 10 – 12 ] . Utilizing this trait of microrheology , we re - cently showed that the mechanical properties of an example complex ﬂuid ( actin networks ) change from bulk to interme - diate behavior below a characteristic crossover length ( r c ) [ 13 ] . This new length scale depends both on structural features of the material as well as on its local and bulk viscoelastic prop - erties . The crossover length , r c , can be related to the dynam - ical correlation length , x d , of the complex ﬂuid . For polymer networks , x d , which is the length scale over which dynami - cal correlations decay in the network , is considered to be re - lated to the mesh size [ 14 , 15 ] , and is commonly measured by dynamic light scattering , requiring large sample volumes . ∗ Electronic address : roichman @ tau . ac . il Measuring x d with microrheology offers a means to connect mechanical properties of a polymer networks to their structure using microscopic quantities . Polymer networks made of cytoskeleton proteins have been thoroughly studied in an effort to understand their biological role in the cell [ 16 – 24 ] . The most researched of which is actin , which is the focus of this paper . We study the spatial depen - dence of the viscoelastic properties of thermally equilibrated F - actin networks , and their relation to the networks’ structure . We start by outlining our generalized analysis scheme of mi - crorheology experiments and its application to reconstituted actin networks of different mesh size . We then demonstrate how to extract the viscoelastic and structural properties of the networks , regardless of tracer particle size ( i . e . , its size rela - tive to the mesh size ) . We proceed to explore the dynamical correlation length’s relation to the networks’ mesh size , and investigate how x d is affected by the introduction of another relevant length scale , the average ﬁlament length h l i . Finally , we examine the relation between the viscoelastic plateau mod - ulus and the dynamic correlation length of the gels . II . EXPERIMENTAL We use entangled F - actin networks as a model viscoelas - tic ﬂuid . The rheological properties of this system have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoreti - cally [ 7 , 9 , 12 , 25 – 28 ] . F - actin gels are well described as networks of semiﬂexible polymers , and their mesh size , x s = 0 . 3 / √ c A , is easily controlled through monomer concentration c A ( c A in mg / ml and x s in m m [ 29 ] ) . G - actin is puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone pow - 2 der [ 30 ] , with a gel ﬁltration step , stored on ice in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris HCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , p H 7 . 8 ) and used within two weeks . The con - centration of the G - actin is determined by absorbance mea - sured using UV / Visible spectrophotometer ( Ultraspec 2100 pro , Pharmacia ) in a cuvette with a 1 cm path length and extinction coefﬁcient e 290 = 26 , 460 M − 1 cm − 1 . Polystyrene colloids with diameters of a = 0 . 245 , 0 . 55 m m ( Invitrogen Lots # 1173396 and # 742530 respectively ) are pre - incubated with a 10 mg / ml BSA solution to prevent non speciﬁc bind - ing of protein to the bead surface [ 31 ] . The average ﬁlament length , h l i , is controlled by addition of capping protein ( CP ) . Actin polymerization is initiated by adding G - actin in various concentrations , CP and beads to F - buffer solution ( 5 mM Tris HCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 05 M KCl , 200 m M EGTA , 1 mM ATP ) and mixing gently for 10 sec . Mesh size is varied by changing G - actin concentration between c A = 0 . 46 − 2 mg / ml , corre - sponding to x s = 0 . 44 − 0 . 21 m m ( at ﬁxed h l i = 13 m m ) . The average ﬁlament length is varied , at constant actin concentra - tion ( x s = 0 . 3 m m ) , by changing the concentration ratio of actin / CP . Filament length distribution is roughly exponential [ 32 ] . We estimate h l i = 2 − 13 m m assuming CP determines the number of actin nucleation sites [ 12 , 32 , 33 ] . Immediately after polymerization the samples were loaded into a glass cell , 150 m m high , and sealed with grease . The glass surfaces were coated with methoxy - terminated PEG to prevent binding of the network to the glass . After equilibrat - ing for 30 min at room temperature , samples were imaged at a plane distanced from the cell walls with an epi - ﬂuorescence microscope ( Olympus IX71 ) , at l = 605 nm , with 60x oil , and 40x air objectives for a = 0 . 245 m m and a = 0 . 55 m m , respec - tively . We recorded the motion of approximately 100 particles in the ﬁeld of view using a CMOS video camera ( Gazelle , Point Gray ) at a frame rate of 70 Hz with an exposure time of 0 . 003 sec . To insure high signal to noise ratio of two - particle displacement correlation measurements , we used data from approximately 8 · 10 5 frames per experiment . Particle track - ing was done using conventional algorithms with accuracy of at least 13 nm [ 34 ] . III . GENERALIZED MICRORHEOLOGY AND THE DYNAMIC CORRELATION LENGTH A . Microrheology at intermediate length scales Conventional microrheology is concerned with characteriz - ing the mechanical properties of a complex ﬂuid by analyzing the diffusion of tracer particles embedded in it [ 3 – 9 ] . We con - centrate on the passive variants of the technique [ 8 ] relating the thermal ﬂuctuations of the tracer particles to the viscoelas - tic properties of the characterized ﬂuid , using both one point ( 1P ) and two point ( 2P ) microrheology . In 1P microrheol - ogy the generalized Stokes Einstein relation ( GSER ) is used to connect the ensemble averaged mean - squared displacement of tracer particles , MSD 1P ≡ h D x 2 ( t ) i ( Fig . 1 ( a ) ) to the vis - coelastic moduli , G’ ( w ) and G” ( w ) ( Fig . 1 ( b ) ) [ 3 , 8 , 35 ] . This technique probes only the local environment of the FIG . 1 : Microrheology of entangled F - actin networks . ( a ) MSD 1P ( green ) and MSD 2P ( red ) as a function of lag time , for x s = 0 . 3 m m , a = 0 . 245 m m and h l i = 13 m m . ( b ) The storage modulus , G ′ ( w ) ( open symbols ) , and loss modulus , G ′′ ( w ) ( ﬁlled symbols ) , extracted from the MSD 1P ( green ) and MSD 2P ( red ) curves of panel ( a ) . tracer particle , which is the microscopic volume explored by the particle within the experimental time scale . Consequently , it is well established that 1P microrheology of actin networks underestimates the bulk viscoelastic moduli [ 7 , 12 , 26 – 28 ] . 2P microrheologywas developed to address this issue , by looking at the average correlated diffusion of two distanced particles . Speciﬁcally , one measures the ensemble - averaged longitudi - nal and transverse displacement correlations of particle pairs as a function of inter - particle distance r and lag time t [ 7 ] : D k ( r , t ) = h D r i k ( t , t ) D r j k ( t , t ) d ( r − R ij ( t ) ) i D ⊥ ( r , t ) = h D r i ⊥ ( t , t ) D r j ⊥ ( t , t ) d ( r − R ij ( t ) ) i , ( 1 ) where D r i k ( t , t ) ( D r i ⊥ ( t , t ) ) is the displacement of particle i during the time between t and t + t , projected parallel ( perpendicular ) to the line connecting the pair , and R ij ( t ) is the pair separation at time t . At sufﬁciently large dis - tances both correlations decay as r − 1 , D k ≃ A ( t ) / r and D ⊥ ≃ A ( t ) / ( 2 r ) . The common practice is to use this asymptote to deﬁne a ‘two - point mean - squared displacement’ , MSD 2P ( t ) ≡ 2 A ( t ) / ( 3 a ) [ 43 ] , and extract from it the vis - coelastic moduli using again the GSER [ 7 ] . Figures 1 ( a ) and ( b ) show the 1P and 2P MSD’s mea - sured in an actin network ( x s = 0 . 3 m m ) , and the moduli ex - tracted from them . The viscoelastic properties obtained from the two approaches are signiﬁcantly different , demonstrating the much softer local environment probed by the 1P tech - nique , as compared to the bulk response probed by the 2P one . These results are in accord , both qualitatively and quanti - tatively , with previous studies on F - actin networks [ 7 , 12 , 26 ] . We have recently shown [ 13 ] that the inter - particle distance at which the bulk response sets in is much larger than would intuitively be expected . For example , in our experiments ( Fig . 2 ( a ) and ( b ) ) a crossover to an intermediate regime is ob - served at r c = 3 . 5 m m , which is an order of magnitude larger than the network mesh size , x s = 0 . 3 m m , and the tracer parti - cle’s radius , a = 0 . 245 m m . The detailed theoretical descrip - tion of the viscoelastic behavior of complex ﬂuids at inter - mediate length scales , below r c , is given elsewhere [ 13 , 36 ] . Simply stated , a particle moving within a ﬂuid disturbs it in two ways : it generates a momentum perturbation that spreads in the bulk , and displaces mass locally [ 37 ] . These two con - tributions can be expanded in terms of inter - particle distance 3 10 0 10 1 r [ m m ] 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 D | | [ m m 2 ] 10 0 10 1 r [ m m ] - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 1 D ^ [ m m 2 ] r c ~ r - 1 ~ r - 3 x10 - 5 ( b ) ( a ) r c FIG . 2 : ( a ) Longitudinal and ( b ) transverse displacement correlations as a function of particle separation , r , at lag time t = 0 . 014 sec for x s = 0 . 3 m m , a = 0 . 245 m m and h l i = 13 m m . The crossover dis - tance r c ( blue dashed line ) is deﬁned at the intersection of the ﬁtted dominant ( r − 1 ) and subdominant ( r − 3 ) power - law decays of D k . and depend on the bulk and local viscosity respectively . For complex ﬂuids in which the local environment is much softer than the bulk , the leading terms in the mobility expansion are [ 13 , 36 ] : M k ( r , w ) = 1 4 ph b r + a 2 g ( x d / a ) 2 ph ℓ r 3 ( 2 ) M ⊥ ( r , w ) = 1 8 ph b r − a 2 g ( x d / a ) 4 ph ℓ r 3 , ( 3 ) where h b ( h ℓ ) corresponds to the bulk ( local ) viscosity and the function g ( x d / a ) arises from calculating the ﬂuid response to a forced rigid sphere of ﬁnite radius a . The ﬁrst term , the dom - inant response , arises from momentum conservation , while the second term , the sub - dominant response , describes mass transfer . At intermediate distances ( r . r c ) the viscoelastic properties of a complex ﬂuid are governed by the subdomi - nant term [ 13 , 36 ] . Equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) imply that the inter - mediate response should decay as 1 / r 3 in the longitudinal di - rection , and exhibit negative correlation in the transverse one . As a result the crossover between the asymptotic , dominant response in the longitudinal direction to the intermediate , sub - dominant one should appear at a distance : r c = a [ 2 ( h b / h ℓ ) g ( x d / a ) ] 1 / 2 , ( 4 ) where g ( x ) is a material speciﬁc function that satisﬁes the asymptotic conditions [ 13 , 36 ] : g ( x → ¥ ) = x 2 , and g ( x → 0 ) = 1 . The displacement correlation , D k , can be related to the mo - bility M k , using the ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem : D k ( r , w ) = − ( 2 k B T / w 2 ) M k ( r , w ) , ( 5 ) where k B T is the thermal energy . To minimize data manipula - tion the analysis is applied on the time ( rather than frequency ) domain and thus the expected expression for D k ( r , t ) is : D k ( r , t ) = A ( t ) r + B ( t ) r 3 ( 6 ) where A ( t ) = k B T 2 p F − 1 (cid:26) 1 − w 2 h b (cid:27) ( 7 ) B ( t ) = k B T p a 2 g ( x d / a ) F − 1 (cid:26) 1 − w 2 h ℓ (cid:27) ( 8 ) where F − 1 denotes the inverse Fourier transform . The crossover distance in the time domain is then given by : r c ( t ) = [ B ( t ) / A ( t ) ] 1 / 2 . ( 9 ) B . Dynamic correlation length measurement One outcome of the preceding theory is that the dynamic correlation length of a complex ﬂuid can be extracted from microrheology experiments , provided that : ( 1 ) the functional form of g ( x ) is known , ( 2 ) the crossover distance ( Eq . ( 9 ) ) is experimentally observed , and ( 3 ) the bulk and local viscosity are measured . We start our analysis by expressing A ( t ) and B ( t ) in terms of MSD 2P and MSD 1P respectively , A ( t ) = 3 a MSD 2P / 2 B ( t ) = 3 a 3 g ( x d / a ) MSD 1P . ( 10 ) To this end we assume that the local viscosity is a function of time and is related to the MSD 1P by the ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem MSD 1P ( t ) = [ k B T / ( 3 p a ) ] F − 1 { ( − w 2 h ℓ ) − 1 } . The bulk viscosity is related to the MSD 2P in a similar manner , and is given by A ( t ) ( Eq . ( 7 ) ) . 4 4 . 5 5 5 . 5 (cid:214) H (cid:190) 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 r c [ m m ] 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 t [ sec ] 2 . 5 3 3 . 5 4 r c [ m m ] ( a ) ( b ) FIG . 3 : Crossover distance as a function of ( a ) lag time , and ( b ) square root of H ( t ) , the experimental function characterizing the bulk to local viscosity ratio . Parameter values are the same as in Fig . 1 ; a = 0 . 245 m m , x s = 0 . 3 m m and h l i = 13 m m . Substituting these expressions into Eq . ( 9 ) we have , r c = (cid:20) 2 a 2 g (cid:16) x d a (cid:17) MSD 1P MSD 2P (cid:21) 1 / 2 = h 2 a 2 g (cid:16) x d a (cid:17) H ( t ) i 1 / 2 ( 11 ) where we deﬁne : H ( t ) ≡ MSD 1P MSD 2P . ( 12 ) as the time dependent observable , and g ( x d / a ) the structural element to be characterized . The functional form of g ( x ) for 4 actin networks was derived using the two - ﬂuid model of poly - mer gels [ 9 , 14 , 15 , 38 – 40 ] , and reads [ 13 , 36 ] ; g ( x ) = x 2 + x + 1 / 3 .

( a ) For all conditions r c is linear with √ H and increases with either x s or a . ( b ) All exper - imental results fall on a master curve once r 2 c is normalized by Ha 2 and presented as a function of scale function given by Eq . ( 13 ) and x d = 1 . 25 x s . Red ( Green ) symbols correspond to a = 0 . 55 ( 0 . 245 ) m m . Each symbol corresponds to a different mesh size : x s = 0 . 21 ( squares ) , 0 . 26 ( triangles ) , 0 . 3 ( circles ) , 0 . 35 ( diamonds ) , and 0 . 44 m m ( left triangles ) . The average ﬁlament length for all experiments was h l i = 13 m m . Recasting r c ( t ) as a function of p H ( t ) reveals their linear dependence ( Fig . 3 ( b ) ) , as predicted theoretically in Eq . ( 11 ) . This linear dependence holds for all our experiments , inde - pendent of tracer particle size and network mesh size ( see Fig . 4 ( a ) ) . Rescaling r 2 c by Ha 2 and presenting it as a func - tion of x s / a results in a collapse of our data on a single master curve shaped according to Eq . ( 13 ) ( see Fig . 4 ( b ) ) [ 13 ] . The only ﬁtting parameter used to ﬁt our data to Eq . ( 13 ) , was the ratio b ≡ x d / x s = 1 . 25 . This result provides an experimen - tal veriﬁcation of the scaling function g ( x d / a ) derived using the two - ﬂuid model for actin networks . Therefore providing a means to extract the dynamic correlation length from mi - crorheology experiments . In Fig . 5 the measured dynamic correlation length is plot - ted versus the networks’ mesh size for two different sizes of tracer particles . Both x d and x s are material properties and should not depend on the tracer particle size . The difference in the dynamic correlation length measured with the two dif - ferent particle sizes is used to gauge its experimental error ( see Fig . 5 ( b ) ) , which is of the order of h D x d i ≃ 50 nm . The fact that the relation between x d and x s is linear suggests that x d scales as the square root of actin concentration , as expected for semi - dilute polymer solution . IV . EFFECT OF FILAMENT LENGTH So far we have shown that the viscoelastic response of actin networks depends on the new emerging length scale r c , rather than directly on the network mesh size or tracer particle size . In this section we introduce a new relevant length scale to the system , the average actin ﬁlament length , h l i , which is controlled experimentally by introducing capping protein .

Black line , in both ﬁgures , corresponds to x d = b x s , where b = 1 . 25 is our ﬁtting parameter . Both x s / a > 1 and x s / a < 1 fall on the same line . Inset : Difference between x d s extracted from the two particle sizes ( D x d ) as a function of x s . Red ( green ) symbols correspond to a = 0 . 55 ( 0 . 245 ) m m . Each symbol corresponds to a different mesh size : x s = 0 . 21 ( squares ) , 0 . 26 ( triangles ) , 0 . 3 ( circles ) , 0 . 35 ( diamonds ) , and x s = 0 . 44 m m ( left triangles ) . show that h l i affects the viscoelastic response of the networks if sufﬁciently decreased . We study several networks made with the same actin monomer concentration but different aver - age ﬁlament length , h l i = 2 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 13 m m . All of these sys - tems create mechanically stable networks with a mesh size of x s = 0 . 3 m m , much smaller than the average ﬁlament length . While the mesh size is conserved in these systems it is not clear if their dynamic correlation length or their mechanical properties vary [ 12 ] . Since the mesh size is the same in all of these gels and the average ﬁlament length is much larger than the mesh size , we would naively expect the crossover length in these networks to be the same as well . In Fig . 6 the crossover length scale of the different networks is examined . Surprisingly , even though the length scale depends linearly on the viscosities ratio ( Fig . 6 ( b ) ) for each h l i , it depends also on ﬁlament length ( Fig . 6 ( a ) ) . 2 3 4 5 6 (cid:214) H (cid:190) 1 . 5 2 . 5 3 . 5 4 . 5 r c [ m m ] 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 t [ sec ] 1 . 5 2 . 5 3 . 5 4 . 5 r c [ m m ] ( a ) ( b ) FIG . 6 : Crossover distance , r c , as a function of ( a ) lag time , and ( b ) square root of H ( t ) for networks with different average ﬁlament length : h l i = 2 ( red squares ) , 5 ( magenta circles ) , 8 ( blue right tri - angles ) , 10 ( cyan diamonds ) , and h l i = 13 m m ( green triangles ) . All networks were polymerized at the same concentration ( c A = 1 mg / ml corresponding to x s = 0 . 3 m m ) . A closer inspection of the data in Fig . 6 ( b ) reveals that curves of different networks do not coincide , implying that the networks vary in dynamical properties . Since the func - tional form of g ( x ) was calculated from the two - ﬂuid model using a general , unspeciﬁed correlation length x d , without any 5 explicit reference to ﬁlament length , we can use it to extract x d of these networks . In Fig . 7 x d is plotted as a function of h l i ; for long ﬁlament length h l i > 5 m m x d does not depend on ﬁlament length , as expected . However , for shorter ﬁlaments , 0 2 4 [ Actin ] / [ CP ] 0 5 10 15 Æ l æ [ m m ] 0 . 35 0 . 4 0 . 45 x d [ m m ] · 10 3 FIG . 7 : Dynamic correlation length , x d , as a function of the average ﬁlament length , h l i ( bottom ) and actin / CP concentration ratio ( top ) . Actin concentration was held at 1 mg / ml , resulting in a x s = 0 . 3 m m , and a = 0 . 245 m m . h l i = 2 , 5 m m , x d decreases with ﬁlament length . Note that the length scale below which x d is affected by ﬁlament length is of the order of r c and one order of magnitude larger than either x s and a . These results further the notion that r c is the length scale which is most relevant in determining explicitly the viscoelastic response of a complex ﬂuid . The results also suggest that x d can be affected by other structural features of a polymer network , in addition to x s , such as its dependence on h l i demonstrated here . We characterize the viscoelastic properties of our networks in terms of the plateau modulus , G ′ ( w b ) , with the lowest ex - perimentally available frequency w b = 0 . 14 Hz , following Liu et al . [ 12 ] . In Fig . 8 ( a ) the plateau modulus , G ′ ( w b ) , is plot - ted as a function of the actin network mesh size . As expected [ 12 , 41 ] , results from the various experiments fall on a sin - gle line showing a power law decay , G ′ ( w b ) (cid:181) x a s , with a power a ≃ − 2 . 8 . However , the mesh size in these experi - ments is determined indirectly from the concentration of actin monomers used for gel preparation . We represent the re - sults of Fig . 8 ( a ) in terms of the directly measured correla - tion length x d ( Fig . 8 ( b ) ) . Here too all experiments fall on the same line with a ≃ − 2 . 8 , even for networks with small ﬁlament length for which x d 6 = b x s . V . CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented a new method to extract the dynamic correlation length of complex ﬂuids from microrhe - ology measurements , and demonstrated it on a model system of entangled F - actin networks . This new technique is based on the observation of a crossover between the bulk and interme - diate viscoelastic response of complex ﬂuids in two point dis - placement correlations ( D k , D ⊥ ) . Using a generalized frame - work of analysis of microrheology , we show that the measured dynamic correlation length is related , but not identical , to the network mesh size . Speciﬁcally , when a third length scale is FIG . 8 : The plateau elastic modulus , G ′ ( w b ) , of all actin networks studied here , as a function of : ( a ) x s estimated from monomer con - centration , and ( b ) x d extracted from measurements . Blue ( red ) sym - bols correspond to a = 0 . 55 ( 0 . 245 ) m m . Red squares correspond to h l i = 13 m m , and red triangles correspond to h l i = 2 , 5 m m . introduced into the problem , as demonstrated here with short ﬁlament lengths , x d depends on it as well as on x s ( Fig . 7 ) . This latter result raises several questions : how is the dynamic correlation length related to the structure of a complex ﬂuid , and consequently , how is it related to its viscoelastic proper - ties . More detailed experiments are required to address these issues . The technique provided here presents a platform with which to characterize in more detail the dynamics of active complex ﬂuids , such as biologically active actomyosin net - works and chemically active self healing gels [ 42 ] .
