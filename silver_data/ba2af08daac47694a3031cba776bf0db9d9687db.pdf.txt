Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions 17 - 20 August 2015 , Amsterdam , The Netherlands Multi - objective optimization for diversity and performance in conceptual structural design Nathan BROWN * , Stavros TSERANIDIS a , Caitlin MUELLER a * a Massachusetts Institute of Technology 77 Massachusetts Ave , Room 5 - 418 Cambridge , MA 02139 ncbrown @ mit . edu Abstract For most traditional applications of structural optimization and form finding for conceptual design , it is possible to pursue a single objective to arrive at an efficient , expressive form . However , when developing a modern building , the design team must consider many other aspects of performance , such as energy usage , architectural quality , and constructability in addition to structural efficiency . If used appropriately , multi - objective optimization ( MOO ) can accurately account for designers’ needs and guide them towards high - performing solutions , while highlighting trade - offs between structural considerations and other performance objectives . In response to this potential , this paper presents a new MOO process that can be integrated into the typical workflow for conceptual building designs . This MOO process is original in how it allows for interaction with performance feedback across separate design disciplines while generating diverse , sometimes unexpected results . This paper applies the MOO process to a long - span roof design example while focusing on two quantitative optimization objectives—structural efficiency and operational energy efficiency—in a variety of climate contexts . The results generated in this case study include a diverse range of designs that exhibit clear trade - offs between objectives . Overall , this paper illustrates new potentials of the MOO approach in conceptual design for producing context - responsive , high - performing , geometrically diverse design solutions . Keywords : structural optimization , conceptual design , multi - objective optimization , design diversity 1 . Introduction When an architect is exploring a conceptual building design , he or she must simultaneously consider and prioritize a multitude of design objectives . A variety of computational methods falling under the category of multi - objective optimization ( MOO ) have been developed to assist in this effort . However , since MOO is typically used in pure engineering applications where all objectives are quantitative and a single solution is desired , its application to architecture has often led to geometrically uninteresting design spaces with expected solutions . For a conceptual MOO process to gain traction with designers looking for creative , expressive forms , it must yield a diverse range of high - performing results that meet a variety of aesthetic preferences . These results must be generated and evaluated rapidly , while balancing allowances for designer preference with clear guidance towards the best solutions ( Mueller and Ochsendorf [ 12 ] ) . Although MOO has demonstrated Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions significant potential to assist conceptual designers in generating and deciding between high - performing , early - stage designs , it has seen only limited use in practice . There are a variety of reasons for this , including the complicated model translation process that must occur between design and analysis software , the often linear process in which members of the design team are only given small latitude to ‘optimize’ for their own performance goals without reference to other disciplines , and the difficulty of using optimization within a process that includes subjective preferences and design goals that are difficult to formulate numerically ( Flager et al . [ 6 ] ) . The goal of recent academic research in this field has been directed at overcoming these limitations , and at exploring the design outcomes generated by an MOO approach to better understand their broad implications for conceptual design . This paper makes a contribution in both areas , first by introducing a new process that can be integrated into existing design tools , and then by employing this process in a conceptual design case study that was selected because it has properties that are generalizable to a wide variety of architectural problems . The case study is tested for a range of climates and orientations to explore how the nature of these architectural problems changes with context . This research is intended as both an initial step in the long - term development of a practical design tool , as well as a means for better understanding trade - offs between the most important design objectives for the subset of architectural typologies in which structural considerations are especially significant . 1 . 1 Importance of structure and energy as early design objectives Although there are multiple architectural objectives in a given building design problem , and the general process established in this paper could be used to pursue many of them , this research focuses on two main objectives : structural efficiency and operational energy efficiency . For large buildings or design problems with specific spatial requirements , such as skyscrapers or long - span roofs , consideration of structural form can dominate the conceptual design phase . This is especially true because efficiency depends more on the geometry of a building than on material , sizing , and other building characteristics developed in later stages . Structurally efficient designs reduce material usage and lifecycle costs , and they are generally safer , more durable , and easier to build ( Mueller [ 13 ] ) . Structural efficiency also matters for these specific design cases because it can have a larger relative effect on cost , environmental impact , and constructability than in smaller , standard building designs . The second objective , operational energy efficiency , has perhaps the most sizable impact on whether or not a building can be considered sustainable . Broadly speaking , sustainable design in buildings is concerned with minimizing energy consumption throughout the four main stages of a building’s lifetime : materials manufacturing , construction , use and maintenance , and end of life ( Bayer et al . [ 3 ] ) . The International Energy Agency [ 8 ] estimates that buildings account for 32 % of total final energy consumption globally , and a large portion of this is used to keep buildings lit , heated , and cooled . The need for a reduction in energy consumption and carbon emissions due to buildings has been well documented , and although various aspects of building performance ( such as daylighting , envelope thermal performance , or ventilation ) could be optimized separately , total operational energy as a design goal most effectively addresses the overall needs of contemporary designers . 1 . 2 MOO for building design There are a number of researchers who have pursued multi - objective optimization in conceptual building design . Asl et al . [ 2 ] establish and test an optimization method for whole building energy Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions performance and daylighting using a parameterized BIM model , illustrating clear trade - offs in window size between usable daylight and thermal performance . However , the building parameterization is limited to the windows rather than controlling the overall form and massing of the building . Flager et al . [ 6 ] present the most complete example of an MOO building design optimized for structure and energy using a posteriori articulation in a process that crosses disciplines and engages a wider range of building performance criteria . Yet this research shares the same limitation of design diversity in that all solutions are restricted to a rectangular geometry , which reduces design freedom in cases where architects may want to be more expressive . With the introduction of ParaGEN , Von Buelow [ 14 ] combines performance feedback from a variety of simulation programs ( structural , lighting , acoustical ) with aesthetic preferences in design through the use of interactive evolutionary algorithms . By breeding designs that have different fitness functions and storing multiple alternatives in a searchable , graphical database , Von Buelow’s proposed workflow gives designers the opportunity to pursue multiple design objectives and visualize trade - offs . Additional researchers have used this powerful framework to explore a number of specific trade - offs in architectural design , including many related to energy performance , but none have tested how these trade - offs change with context or captured the whole - building performance for structurally dominated conceptual designs . A review of the literature and current state of design practice yields the following research question : how can architectural , conceptual MOO design problems be formulated and solved in a way that generates diverse , high - performing solutions ? Additional related research questions arise during the application of MOO to specific structural problems : what design knowledge about the importance of structural efficiency as it relates to other contemporary design goals is generalizable , and is it possible to establish common design rules for specific trade - offs in a given context ? 3 . Methodology To address design space formulation and exploration for structure and energy in the conceptual design of long - span roof structures , a case study model was developed and rigorously tested . The procedure for implementing the case study included the development of a parametric design space , sampling that design space , evaluating each design , visualizing each result , and analyzing the overall data ( see Figure 1 ) . Each of these steps is explained in the following sections . The design lessons learned from this case study could be applied to a variety of architectural programs that contain large , open , conditioned volumes , such as airports , convention centers , or stadiums . The initial case study selected for this paper is the conceptual design of an airport terminal structure . The terminal contains a free interior space of 45 m x 100 m , which is spanned by a series of steel arches in one direction and transverse beams between the arches in the other . The sides of the terminal consist of a panelized curtain wall system that mixes transparent glazed panels with spandrel glass panels concealing interior insulation . This structure allows for free occupant movement while providing design opportunities for tuning both natural daylighting and envelope properties for operational energy efficiency . The airport design problem was inspired by an existing bus terminal in Qingdao , Shandong , China that contains a similar ‘x - brace’ structural system ( see Figure 2 ) . This design example was selected because it explores two major generalizable design problems that trade - off between structural efficiency and operational energy efficiency . The first problem is the Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions enclosed arch , where greater arch height often leads to higher structural efficiency , but also to more volume that must be heated and cooled . The second problem is the cantilevered overhang , in which increased overhang length could lead to more efficient solar gains and lighting strategies for certain climates and orientations , but also requires more structural material . In testing the design , three model locations and two model orientations were selected to assess the response of various design options to different contexts . The first location , Boston , has both heating and cooling loads , but is heating dominated . The second location , Sydney , is in a more temperate climate where the required cooling load is slightly higher than Boston’s , but the heating load is very small . The third location is Abu - Dhabi , which has no heating load but is dominated by cooling loads that are roughly five times higher than those required by Boston and Sydney . For each of these locations , the model was simulated with both a west - east and south - north orientation to test differences in the impact of the overhang direction .

To prepare for evaluation of both structural and energy performance , the model included linear elements representing the structural pieces of steel as well as surfaces representing the exterior envelope of the building . The ranges for each parameter were determined based on general design problem constraints , such as a minimum requirement for structure clearance on both the interior and exterior of the building . Figure 3 : Design parameters for the case study 3 . 3 Performance evaluation The performance of each design was measured using plug - ins available for Rhinoceros and Grasshopper . The structural optimization objective was to minimize the weight of steel required , and the energy optimization objective used was to minimize the annual operational energy of the building , which includes requirements for lighting , heating , and cooling . Structural performance for each design was quantified using Karamba [ 9 ] , a finite element modeler that interacts with Rhinoceros geometry . To calculate the overall weight of structural material , Karamba’s sizing feature was used . This feature checks the allowable axial , bending , and buckling loads for each member and then searches through a structural section library to determine the smallest member that can adequately handle each load before outputting the total weight of the structural system . The energy evaluation for each model was performed using ARCHSIM [ 1 ] , a Grasshopper plug - in that connects Rhinoceros geometry with EnergyPlus , a widely used energy analysis and thermal load simulation program made available by the U . S . Department of Energy . ARCHSIM assigns material properties to each surface of the model , creates thermal zones , and runs a whole year simulation , returning the total amount of energy required to keep the building appropriately lit and temperature - controlled for an entire year . This model accounts for solar and temperature effects , and the envelope assumptions were created based on an energy code compliant building design for the Boston region ( see Figure 4 ) .

This case study uses the primary energy requirements , in Joules , for each performance metric as the standard unit of comparison . To arrive at this metric , the weight of the steel structure was multiplied by an embodied energy coefficient given by Hammond & Jones [ 7 ] . For the energy performance , the model captured each load ( lighting , cooling , and heating ) separately before multiplying them by on - site and transmission efficiencies and coefficients of performance as detailed in Bourgeois et al . [ 4 ] . Since the purpose of this case study is to explore relative designs within a specific design space , the primary energy requirements have been normalized to the average for each category . These normalized results are reported as scores , which represent the magnitude of the performance relative to the average , with lower scores considered to be better or more optimal . The Boston case was used as the standard for this normalization when comparing across climates , leading to cooling loads for Abu Dhabi in the range of 7 - 12 times the average . However , the design scores in every other case range from roughly 0 - 2 . To ensure a representative sampling of the design space , a Latin hypercube algorithm ( McKay et al . [ 11 ] ) was used and then scaled to the appropriate design variables . For each of the six contexts formed by the different locations and orientations , the parametric design was sampled at a rate of n = 999 . The simulations were completed in a loop within Grasshopper , with the sampling code inputting each design , triggering new evaluations , and recording the performance results . 3 . 6 Optimization and visualization In multi - objective optimization for design , there are a number of available methods for selecting the best design based on designer preference . These include using a priori articulation of preferences , where a composite weighted objective function is created at the outset , a posteriori optimization articulation of preferences , where the designer chooses from a number of near optimal designs after an optimization has been run , and interactive articulation of preferences , where a designer gives input while the algorithm is running ( Marler and Arora [ 10 ] ) . For this case study , it was most appropriate to consider post - optimization articulation of preferences , since the purpose of this paper is to show creative and generative potential rather than arrive at a single optimal solution . For each sample , the set of Pareto optimal designs was selected for presentation , since these are considered the ‘optimal’ designs in which the performance in one objective cannot be improved without decreasing the performance in another . The selected designs were found using Pareto Front , a MATLAB function that reads in a list of performances for each iteration and selects the ones that are not dominated by any other design ( Cao [ 5 ] ) . 3 . 7 Diversity For multi - objective optimization tools to be considered useful by creative architects in exploratory conceptual design , they must produce a wide range of high - performing solutions for potential selection . To quantify the diversity of each optimal set , this paper uses the formula : D = max | | X centroid – X i | | ( 1 ) Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions where X corresponds to the design vector of size n containing n design variable settings . This diversity metric calculates the Euclidian distance from the centroid of a set of designs to the furthest outlier ( Mueller and Ochsendorf [ 13 ] ) . A lower value for D indicates less choice and trade - off in design . The metric effectively measures how different a group of designs are from one another , since a group of similar designs converging towards one solution would have a low score , and a set with a wide range of solutions would have a high score . This metric takes into account each design by its contribution to the centroid calculation , but one particular outlier can heavily affect it . For this reason , the most numerically distinct design in each set is identified in the results section . 4 . Results and Discussion 4 . 1 Results in different contexts The performance and optimization results of the case study are presented in this section . Figure 5 gives the full results of the case study , including the structural performance for each design plotted against the energy performance in each of the different orientations and climates . In these plots , the entire sample set is shown in gray , while the Pareto optimal points are colored black . The plots are normalized , with 1 being the average in Boston ( west - east orientation ) and lower scores considered to be better performance . The first column presents the overall results for primary energy requirements on the y - axis , and the second column shows the same plot zoomed in on the best performing designs in the lower left hand corner of the objective space . The last three columns break out the lighting , heating , and cooling loads on the y - axis , showing the effect of climate and orientation on each separate performance factor . Figure 6 presents both a geometric and graphical representation of each design on the Pareto optimal front for the different contexts . They are ordered from best to worst in terms of structure , or left to right when moving across the graphs in Figure 5 . Due to the definition of Pareto optimality , the designs are also ordered from worst to best in terms of energy , a relationship which can be observed by noting the opposite trends of the performance bar graphs given for each design . The figure also gives the calculated diversity for each set and denotes the single design that is most distinct in each optimal set . The results for each location show a clear Pareto front , although these fronts vary in terms of diversity and number of optimal solutions . A large sample ( n = 999 ) was required to arrive at these Pareto fronts of in between 5 - 10 designs , which was computationally expensive . Each location and orientation shares a few common designs , including the solution ( 22 ) that scores the best overall in terms of structure . Most of the solutions are nearly symmetrical , although there is some noticeably patterned asymmetry in the south - north orientation for Sydney , in which the south ( left ) side windows are allowed to be larger . In every case , the designs trend from highly arched to more flat as the structural score worsens , and in the case of Boston the best energy solutions even have convex arches that allow in as much sunlight as possible . When looking at the loads individually , the Pareto optimal designs do not always form a clear front , but do trend towards the lower left of the graphs . The designs were most diverse in the Boston S - N orientation , followed by Sydney S - N , Boston W - E , Sydney W - E , and then both Abu Dhabi orientations . In Boston , which requires both heating and cooling loads , the designer appears to have the most choice , with high - performing designs ranging from arch - shaped to flat . Although Sydney fared well numerically in terms of diversity ( which can be Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions Figure 5 : Structural score versus energy metrics compared across contexts 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 Structure ( Embodied ) Score C oo li ng Load 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 Structure ( Embodied ) Score E ne r g y ( O pe r a t i ona l ) S c o r e 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 Structure ( Embodied ) Score H ea t i ng Load 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 Structure ( Embodied ) Score L i gh t i ng Load 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 5 10 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 5 10 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 3 22 27 516677717 758 904 959 Structure ( Embodied ) Score E ne r g y ( O pe r a t i ona l ) S c o r e 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 3 22 516677717 722 758 904 959 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1 22 59 141 475 690 959 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1 22 83 141225 457 480 652 873 959 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 3 1 . 5 1 . 7 22 44516677959 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 7 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 3 1 . 5 1 . 7 22 410 516 904 959 Full Energy Zoom Lighting Cooling Heating Load Scale x 5 Load Scale x 5 No Load No Load Boston W E S N Boston W E Sydney S N Sydney Abu Dhabi W E Abu Dhabi S N Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions Figure 6 : Pareto optimal design sets for each climate and orientation ES 1 . 050 . 43 ES 0 . 860 . 52 ES 0 . 880 . 5 ES 0 . 90 . 48 ES 0 . 830 . 68 ES 0 . 830 . 81 ES 0 . 831 . 07 E S 0 . 84 0 . 57 ES 0 . 910 . 47 ES 0 . 870 . 43 E S 0 . 610 . 56 ES 0 . 610 . 49 ES 0 . 610 . 71 ES 0 . 60 . 83 ES 0 . 610 . 47 ES 0 . 880 . 43 ES 0 . 590 . 69 ES 0 . 60 . 49 ES 0 . 590 . 52 ES 0 . 590 . 67 ES 0 . 590 . 73 ES 0 . 581 . 07 ES 0 . 590 . 59 E S 0 . 59 0 . 65 ES 0 . 60 . 47 ES 1 . 470 . 43 ES 1 . 260 . 49 ES 1 . 240 . 52 E S 1 . 250 . 5 ES 1 . 280 . 47 ES 1 . 490 . 43 ES 1 . 20 . 71 ES 1 . 220 . 52 ES 1 . 220 . 57 ES 1 . 230 . 47 22 ES 1 . 040 . 43 ES 0 . 850 . 71 ES 0 . 860 . 52 E S 0 . 88 0 . 5 ES 0 . 880 . 48 ES 0 . 840 . 81 ES 0 . 850 . 57 ES 0 . 910 . 47 959 * 717 677 516 904 27 758 22 959 717 677 516 904 722 758 875 * 22 * 959 141 475 690 59 Boston Sydney Abu Dhabi 22 959 141 225 652 457 83 480 562 * 873 22 959 * 44 677 516 22 410 516 904 * 959 Number of Designs = 5 Diversity = 0 . 57 Number of Designs = 6 Diversity = 0 . 61 Number of Designs = 5 Diversity = 0 . 41 Number of Designs = 8 Diversity = 0 . 69 Number of Designs = 10 Diversity = 0 . 79 Number of Designs = 9 Diversity = 0 . 85 W E * Most numerically distinct design in set Structure Score Energy Score 1 . 001 . 00 W E W E S N S N S N Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions partially attributed to allowances for asymmetry ) , it seems as though the temperate climate mostly favors large arches . The solutions for Abu Dhabi were not as diverse , and although they both included highly arched designs towards the left end of their Pareto fronts , the remaining three solutions seemed to be flatter and contain less volume . The S - N orientation yielded more diverse results than the W - E orientation in each set , which demonstrates the impact of the changing shading overhang on the sunniest face of the building . In general , these results support an argument that mixed heating / cooling climates force designers to pick a performance dimension in which they want to be most successful , whereas temperate climates offer an opportunity to explore pure structural optimization , and climate intense ( heating or cooling ) regions require designs that more directly respond to that climate . However , this conclusion would have to be further tested for other cases to be generalized . 4 . 2 Sampling and diversity The presence of Design 22 on the Pareto front of each sample indicates a weakness of brute force sampling methods . When setting up the problem , a designer can only ensure representative sampling across the design space , since he or she is blind to the objective space until samples are evaluated . Thus , although there are samples relatively close to Design 22 in terms of parameters , it appears isolated on the performance plots . Depending on the size of the sample set and the specific sampling algorithm used , the existence of isolated points could substantially change the shape of the Pareto plot . In Figure 7 , the design sample was expanded to include 40 additional designs that were very close to Design 22 in the design space . This manual , directed sampling is an approximation of how an evolutionary algorithm could quickly move towards the Pareto front and establish it at a higher resolution with less computational effort . Figure 7 : Comparison of the original sample and a directed sample near Design 22 for Boston ( W - E ) However , a clear strength of sampling a parametric design space for MOO is that many other potential designs exist slightly off of the Pareto front . In the previous section , only designs on the Pareto fronts were displayed visually . Yet in many cases , a conceptual designer may want even more geometric diversity than the Pareto front offers , and may be willing to pay a slight performance penalty for this 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 1 . 1 516 677 717 904 959 1001 1007 1011 Structure ( Embodied ) Score E ne r g y ( O pe r a t i ona l ) S c o r e 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 1 . 1 22 516 677 717 904 959 Structure ( Embodied ) Score E ne r g y ( O pe r a t i ona l ) S c o r e N - S Higher Resolution Sampling Around Design 22 Original Objective Space Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions extra diversity . As an example , Figure 8 shows a set including the 35 designs that are closest to the Pareto optimal points for Boston W - E . This new set exhibits an even higher measure of diversity ( 0 . 76 compared to 0 . 69 ) , while performing nearly as well as the points on the Pareto front . The threshold of proximity to the Pareto front could be adjusted until a designer is satisfied with the diversity of results their model is generating , unlocking additional creative capabilities within an MOO process .

Summary of contributions In conclusion , this paper presents a new multi - objective optimization process for structural conceptual design that can be used in cases where the overall form has a considerable effect on the success of the building design . This process was applied to a conceptual proposal for an airport terminal and used to generate a wide variety of high - performing , diverse design solutions based on an initial parametric design . Two significant and broad objectives , structural efficiency and operational energy efficiency , were pursued and trade - offs between the two were compared . A number of generalizable lessons were proposed for the design of enclosed arch structures , as well as open program structures with large exterior overhangs . Overall , the results indicate that trade - offs for these design problems depend significantly on climate . Although rules of thumb exist for designers concerning how these problems change for different contexts , MOO can help designers understand these trade - offs quantitatively and also reveal unexpected relationships between significant architectural objectives . This research could lead to a number of areas for future work . First , the methodology should be tested on other case studies that explore both arch and overhang trade - offs , as well as entirely different architectural problems . The methodology could also be changed to include other objectives based on what is most useful for designers . In addition , the metrics used in this paper could be expanded , such as calculating a performance penalty for diversity by how far off of the Pareto front a designer must go in the objective space before finding an appropriately diverse set . An evolutionary algorithm could also be employed to more quickly find and explore the Pareto front at a higher resolution . Ultimately , the goal of this research is the development of an effective , usable MOO process for conceptual designers , and the creation of a tool that implements this process . Further testing of such a tool will allow for more advanced knowledge of the main trade - offs between significant objectives in Proceedings of the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures ( IASS ) Symposium 2015 , Amsterdam Future Visions conceptual structural building design , as well as a greater understanding of how these trade - offs change with context . Each of these contributions has the ability to make MOO a more viable and valuable tool for conceptual designers , leading to successful , high performing designs .
