A RT I C L E S Isoform diversity in the Arp2 / 3 complex determines actin ﬁlament dynamics Jasmine V . G . Abella 1 , Chiara Galloni 1 , Julien Pernier 2 , David J . Barry 1 , Svend Kjær 3 , Marie - France Carlier 2 and Michael Way 1 , 4 The Arp2 / 3 complex consists of seven evolutionarily conserved subunits ( Arp2 , Arp3 and ARPC1 – 5 ) and plays an essential role in generating branched actin ﬁlament networks during many different cellular processes . In mammals , however , the ARPC1 and ARPC5 subunits are each encoded by two isoforms that are 67 % identical . This raises the possibility that Arp2 / 3 complexes with different properties may exist . We found that Arp2 / 3 complexes containing ARPC1B and ARPC5L are signiﬁcantly better at promoting actin assembly than those with ARPC1A and ARPC5 , both in cells and in vitro . Branched actin networks induced by complexes containing ARPC1B or ARPC5L are also disassembled ∼ 2 - fold slower than those formed by their counterparts . This difference reﬂects the ability of cortactin to stabilize ARPC1B - and ARPC5L - but not ARPC1A - and ARPC5 - containing complexes against coronin - mediated disassembly . Our observations demonstrate that the Arp2 / 3 complex in higher eukaryotes is actually a family of complexes with different properties . The Arp2 / 3 complex was originally identified in Acanthamoeba and consists of seven proteins ( actin - related proteins ; Arp2 and Arp3 , and Arp2 / 3 complex subunits ; ARPC1 – 5 ) that are conserved in all eukaryotes , with the exception of some algae , microsporidia and protists 1 – 3 . The complex plays an essential role in a wide variety of cellular processes including lamellipodia - mediated cell migration , endocytosis and phagocytosis , by virtue of its ability to generate branched actin filament networks 3 – 7 . Inisolation , theArp2 / 3complexhasweakintrinsicactinnucleating activity 6 , 8 . The discovery that ActA , the bacterial protein essential for actin - based motility of Listeria 9 , stimulated Arp2 / 3 - driven actin polymerization provided the first evidence that the complex needs to be activated to promote filament assembly 8 . Following this study , additional nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) have been identified 3 , 10 , 11 . Type I NPFs ( WASP , N - WASP , WAVE1 - 3 , WASH , WHAMM and JMY ) have a conserved carboxy - terminal VCA domain that interacts with actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex 12 – 17 . Type I NPFs are highlydivergentoutsidetheirVCAdomainsandcapableofinteracting with a variety of regulatory or scaﬀolding proteins to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex downstream of a variety of signalling pathways 3 , 11 . Cortactin , a type II NPF , binds to and weakly activates the Arp2 / 3 complex through its amino - terminal acid region 18 – 21 ( NtA ) . Cortactin also interacts with actin filaments through a set of central repeats , which help target the protein to Arp2 / 3 complexes at branch points 19 , 20 , 22 . At these sites , cortactin can act synergistically with N - WASP displacing it from Arp2 / 3 , to enable actin filament elongation and stabilize Arp2 / 3 at branches 19 , 20 , 22 – 25 . Cortactin also promotes stabilization of branched actin networks by protecting the Arp2 / 3 complex from coronin 1B - mediated debranching 26 . Type I coronins ( 1A – C ) are a conserved family of actin - binding proteins that inhibit the Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro and promote disassembly of branched actin networks 27 . Coronin 1B also enhances filament depolymerization by coordinating the activity of cofilin and AIP1 and indirectly promoting activation of cofilin by recruiting the phosphatase Slingshot 28 , 29 . Interestingly , in many higher eukaryotes , several Arp2 / 3 complex subunits are encoded by more than one gene ( Fig . 1a ) . For example , in mammals , Arp3 , ARPC1 and ARPC5 are each represented by two isoforms that are 91 , 67 and 67 % identical respectively 30 – 32 . The sequence diﬀerences between the two human ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms are spread throughout their length and many are surface exposed 33 ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 1A ) . This raises the possibility that there exist Arp2 / 3 complexes exhibiting diﬀerent properties . Using actin - based motility of vaccinia virus as a model system and in vitro pyrene actin assembly assays , we now show that the ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms aﬀect Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated 1 Cellular Signalling and Cytoskeletal Function , The Francis Crick Institute , Lincoln’s Inn Fields Laboratory , 44 Lincoln’s Inn Fields , London , WC2A 3LY , UK . 2 Laboratoire d’Enzymologie et Biochimie Structurale , I2BC , CNRS , 91198 Gif - sur - Yvette , France . 3 The Structural Biology Science Technology Platform , The Francis Crick Institute , Lincoln’s Inn Fields Laboratory , 44 Lincoln’s Inn Fields , London , WC2A 3LY , UK . 4 Correspondence should be addressed to M .

The two isoforms also diﬀerentially aﬀect the disassembly of branched actin filament networks by coronin 1B and 1C downstream of cortactin . RESULTS The human Arp2 / 3 complex is not a single species We identified antibodies that specifically recognize individual ARPC1 or ARPC5 isoforms by immunoblot analysis of short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) - treated cells and those expressing GFP - tagged constructs ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) . GFP - Trap pulldowns on extracts from HeLa cells expressing GFP - tagged ARPC1A , ARPC1B , ARPC5 or ARPC5L demonstrate that the diﬀerent isoforms can assemble in all four possible combinations ( Fig . 1c ) . Immunoprecipitation of ARPC1A and ARPC1B from HeLa cells confirmed that the endogenous proteins are found in complexes containing ARPC5 and ARPC5L ( Fig . 1d ) . ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms are also found in other routinely used cell types , albeit at diﬀerent relative levels ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . 1C ) . It is noticeable that in RNA - mediated interference ( RNAi ) - treated cells , the levels of ARPC1A and ARPC1B influence each other ( Supplementary Fig . 1B ) , as has been reported for some of the other subunits 34 , 35 . To explore the interdependence between the ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms we performed quantitative immunoblot analysis on RNAi - treated cells . Depletion of ARPC2 , encoded by a single gene , leads to loss of all complex subunits , including both ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms ( Fig . 1f and Supplementary Fig . 1D ) . In contrast , loss of ARPC1A consistently led to an increase in ARPC1B and a decrease in ARPC5 ( Fig . 1f ) . The levels of both ARPC1 isoforms were also reduced in cells treated with ARPC5 siRNA . Although there was some variation , in general , loss of ARPC1B or ARPC5L did not impact on the level of the other isoforms . Our analysis clearly demonstrates that multiple Arp2 / 3 complex species exist and that their relative levels vary between diﬀerent cell types .

( 4 . 83 ± 0 . 05 µ m ) or short actin tails ( 1 . 08 ± 0 . 02 µ m ) respectively , that are similar in length to those in cells depleted of the individual proteins ( Fig . 2c ) . In contrast , other combinations ( ARPC1A / C5L and ARPC1B / C5 ) yield actin tails similar in length to controls ( Fig . 2c ) . Collectively , these data show that all combinations produce functional Arp2 / 3 complexes and that the length of actin tails seen in infected cells represents the net output of the diﬀerent Arp2 / 3 complexes . Importantly , it also suggests that diﬀerent Arp2 / 3 complexes may have distinct actin nucleating activities . Actin nucleating activity depends on Arp2 / 3 subunit composition To examine whether isoform - specific tail lengths reflect diﬀerences in actin assembly , we measured the speed of vaccinia in cells lacking ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 2C ) . In cells depleted of either ARPC1A or ARPC5 , vaccinia moves with long actin tails 1 . 18 - fold and 1 . 28 - fold faster than controls ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 ) . Conversely , the absence of ARPC1B or ARPC5L results in slower motility . These diﬀerences might reflect the ability of N - WASP to recruit distinct Arp2 / 3 complexes to the virus . However , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) reveals that all ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms recruited to the virus in the absence of actin polymerization have a half - life of recovery of ∼ 6s ( Supplementary Fig . 2D ) . This suggests that Arp2 / 3 complexes containing ARPC1B or ARPC5L are more eﬃcient in promoting actin polymerization than those with ARPC5 or ARPC1A . To directly assess actin nucleating activity we performed in vitro pyrene actin assays with defined recombinant human Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Fig . 3a , b ) . We found that Arp2 / 3 complexes containing ARPC1B / C5L are more eﬃcient at stimulating actin polymerization when activated by the VCA domain of N - WASP than Arp2 / 3 complex purified from goat brain ( Fig . 3b , c ) .

( c ) The time course of actin ﬁlament debranching monitored after polymerization by recombinant ARPC1B / C5L and ARPC1A / C5 complexes . Data from two independent experiments were combined and error bars represent the standard deviation for n = 20 images . ARPC1A / C5 was less eﬀective . Arp2 / 3 complexes with ARPC1A / C5L or ARPC1B / C5 gave rates of actin assembly comparable to those obtained with Arp2 / 3 complex from goat brain ( Fig . 3b , c ) . This suggests that the activity of purified goat Arp2 / 3 in our assays represents the sum of the diﬀerent species within our preparation . Consistent with this , immunoblot analysis confirmed that purified Arp2 / 3 complex from goat brain contains both ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms , although the ARPC1B isoform was only weakly detected in our preparations ( Fig . 3a ) . The speed and length of virus - induced tails will depend not only on the actin nucleating eﬃciency of the diﬀerent Arp2 / 3 complexes but also their relative abundance . Using our recombinant Arp2 / 3 complexes , we determined the relative amounts of the diﬀerent isoforms in our HeLa cells by performing quantitative immunoblot analyses . We found that ARPC1B and ARPC5 are expressed at ∼ 2 . 3 - and 1 . 8 - fold higher levels than ARPC1A and ARPC5L respectively ( Fig . 3d ) . If all four combinations assemble equally well , the order of abundance would be ARPC1B / ARPC5 ( 45 % ) , ARPC1B / ARPC5L ( 25 % ) , ARPC1A / ARPC5 ( 19 % ) and ARPC1A / ARPC5L ( 11 % ) . On the basis of these predictions , only depletion of ARPC5 would be expected to give long tails . However , our analysis demonstrates that loss of either ARPC1A or ARPC5 results in long actin tails ( Fig . 2c ) , as well as concomitant loss of the other subunit ( Fig . 1f ) . These tail lengths would not be predicted to occur solely on the basis of the relative abundance of each isoform . Hence , additional factors must also influence how much of each complex is actually formed . Arp2 / 3 composition impacts on actin tail disassembly The length of an actin tail is determined by the balance between the rate of new actin polymerization and filament disassembly in the tail . To investigate whether the diﬀerent Arp2 / 3 complexes generate filament networks with diﬀerent stabilities , we took advantage of photoactivatable ( PA ) GFP – actin ( Cherry – GFP PA – β - actin ) to mea - sure the rate of actin disassembly in tails ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Video 3 ) .

These data indicate that actin tails are also more resistant to disassembly when nucleated by ARPC1B or ARPC5L - containing Arp2 / 3 complexes . Given that ARPC1 and ARPC5 contact the mother filament , we wondered whether the diﬀerent actin tail disassembly rates reflect the inherent stability of the diﬀerent isoforms at actin branch points . To examinethispossibilityweperformed invitro debranchingassayswith ARPC1A / C5 - and ARPC1B / C5L - containing Arp2 / 3 complexes 42 . Unexpectedly , we found that actin branches formed by ARPC1B / C5L - containing complexes were less stable than those nucleated by ARPC1A / C5 ( Fig . 4c ) . As these data do not reflect the stability of actin within tails , we reasoned that ARPC1B / C5L complexes must be stabilized by additional cellular factors , whereas the inherently more stable ARPC1A / C5 complexes may be more readily targeted by disassembly factors . 6 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Coronin promotes disassembly of actin nucleated by ARPC1A / C5 complexes Previous observations demonstrate that coronin 1B , which interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex , promotes disassembly of Arp2 / 3 - nucleated filament networks by inducing debranching 27 , 28 . Consistent with a possible role in actin tail disassembly , coronin 1B and 1C are recruited to vaccinia actin tails ( Fig . 5a ) . Moreover , depletion of coronin 1B or 1C results in the formation of long tails but has no impact on the speed of the virus ( Fig . 5b , c and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Loss of both coronin 1B and 1C did not further enhance tail length ( Fig . 5d ) , suggesting that they may function as a complex . Indeed , reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that endogenous coronin 1B and 1C are capable of associating with each other ( Fig . 5e ) . Co - depletion of ARPC5 with coronin 1B / 1C leads to similarly long actin tails as loss of ARPC5 or coronin 1B / 1C alone ( Fig . 5d ) . This suggests that ARPC5L - dependent complexes are inherently refractory to displacement by coronins , as tails do not become even longer on co - depletion of ARPC5 with coronins . However , depletion of coronin 1B or 1C with ARPC1B or ARPC5L is able to restore short actin tail lengths to those seen in controls ( Fig . 5f ) . To examine whether these diﬀerences in actin disassembly are specific to coronin 1B / C , we examined the impact of loss of cofilin on the length of vaccinia - induced tails ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . In agreement with previous results with Listeria 43 – 45 , we found that RNAi - mediated loss of cofilin results in long actin tails . However , in contrast to coronin 1B / C , there was no dependence on the ARPC5 isoform ( Supplementary Fig . 3B ) . Taken together our data suggest that the actin branches assembled by Arp2 / 3 complexes containing ARPC1A or ARPC5 are more susceptible to coronin 1B / C - mediated disassembly than those induced by ARPC1B or ARPC5L complexes . Cortactin regulates coronin - mediated actin tail disassembly The location of components in the actin tail can be indicative of their functional role in actin tails 46 . The lack of recruitment of GFP - tagged coronin 1B and 1C immediately behind the virus also provides further support for their role in actin tail disassembly as opposed to assembly ( Fig . 6a ) . Furthermore , the distribution of coronin 1B / C is independent of the ARPC1 or ARPC5 isoforms present or the length of the actin tail ( Fig . 6a ) . Cortactin antagonizes debranching by coronin 1B and also contacts the ARPC1 and ARPC5 subunits 26 , 47 . Hence , cortactin , which is recruited to vaccinia actin tails 48 , may be responsible for regulating the debranching activity of coronins towards the isoform - specific complexes . In contrast to coronin , cortactin is recruited immediately behind the virus at the NATURE CELL BIOLOGY ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION 7 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Unprocessed original scans of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 6 . site of actin tail nucleation ( Fig . 6b ) . To examine the distribution of cortactin and coronin in a quantitative fashion we averaged their fluorescence intensity along the actin tail with respect to the virus in an automated and unbiased approach using live cell imaging ( Fig . 6c and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . We found that peak intensity for cortactin and coronin 1C behind the virus is 360 – 385 and 1 , 095 – 1 , 225nm respectively ( Fig . 6c ) , so the separation between the two is in the range 710 – 865nm , which represents a 95 % confidence interval . The diﬀerence in the localization of cortactin and coronin in actin tails would be consistent with their antagonistic relationship . To investigate whether cortactin negatively regulates coronin on actin tails , we examined whether loss of cortactin leads to short tails . To our surprise however , we found that cortactin depletion does not impact on the length of actin tails ( 2 . 65 ± 0 . 03 compared to 2 . 62 ± 0 . 03 µ m ; Fig . 6d ) . Furthermore , co - depletion of cortactin and coronin 1B reverted the long tail phenotype induced by the loss of coronin 1B ( 4 . 15 ± 0 . 01 µ m ) back to wild - type lengths ( 2 . 66 ± 0 . 03 µ m ; Fig . 6d ) . These data suggest that cortactin is necessary for coronin - mediated debranching . We did not , however , detect any change in the localization of either coronin 1B or 1C in actin tails in the absence of cortactin in live cell imaging ( Fig . 6e ) . This suggests that although cortactin is required for coronin - mediated debranching it is not necessary for its recruitment to actin filaments within the tail . Cortactin preferentially stabilizes ARPC1B / C5L complexes in actin tails As cortactin stabilizes Arp2 / 3 complexes at branch points 20 , 22 , 23 , we wondered whether it is responsible for the enhanced stability of ARPC1B / C5L complexes in actin tails . To explore this possibility , we performed actin photoactivation experiments in cells depleted of ARPC5 or ARPC5L as well as cortactin ( Fig . 7a and Supplementary Fig . 5A ) . We found that the half - life of the activated GFP PA – actin signal seen in the absence of ARPC5 ( 12 . 09 ± 0 . 80s ) reverts to controls values ( 7 . 43 ± 0 . 23s ) when cortactin is also depleted 8 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved A RT I C L E S ( 7 . 67 ± 0 . 20s ; Fig . 7a ) . Conversely , the half - life of actin in the tail seen in ARPC5L siRNA - treated cells increases from 5 . 37 ± 0 . 23s to 7 . 42 ± 0 . 19s when both ARPC5L and cortactin are depleted ( Fig . 7a ) . The most straightforward interpretation is that cortactin promotes the recruitment of coronin to all Arp2 / 3 branches but is eﬀective at stabilizing only ARPC5L complexes . In support of this , the absence of cortactin reverts the long tail phenotype induced by ARPC5L - containing complexes to control values ( 2 . 73 ± 0 . 04 as compared with 5 . 00 ± 0 . 06 µ m ; Fig . 7b ) . In contrast , co - depletion of cortactin and ARPC5L rescued short actin tails induced by ARPC5 complexes back to wild - type lengths ( 2 . 55 ± 0 . 03 versus 1 . 00 ± 0 . 03 µ m ; Fig . 7b ) . Following this logic , when all Arp2 / 3 complex combinations are present , lossofcortactinresultsinlessstableARPC1B / C5Lcomplexes , but more stable ARPC1A / C5 complexes , so the net result is still the formation of wild - type tail lengths . As cortactin impacts on the branch stability of Arp2 / 3 complexes , we wondered whether loss of cortactin would aﬀect virus speed , which depends on actin nucleation beneath the virus . We found that cortactin depletion leads to faster virus speeds that are comparable to those seen on ARPC5 loss ( Fig . 7c ) . We reasoned that this could be due to the faster turnover rates of the pool of ARPC1B / C5L - containing complexes . Consistent with this , virus speeds are not further increased on co - depletion of both cortactin and ARPC5 ( Fig . 7c ) . Finally , ascortactindoesnotcontributetothebranch stability of ARPC1A / C5 complexes , its depletion has no eﬀect on the virus speeds induced by ARPC1A / C5 nucleation events ( Fig . 7c ) . To confirm that cortactin stabilizes ARPC5L - containing com - plexes , we examined the impact of the loss of cortactin on the stability of ARPC2 as a reporter for all Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Fig . 7d and Supple - mentary Fig . 5B ) . Using photoactivation , we found that the half - life of ARPC2 in the actin tail is 5 . 53 ± 0 . 34s ( Fig . 7d ) . This value did not change when cortactin was depleted ( 5 . 54 ± 0 . 2s ) . As expected , loss of ARPC1A / C5 , which increases tail length , also enhances the stability of ARPC2 ( 8 . 19 ± 0 . 40s ) , whereas in short tails induced by depletion of ARPC1B / C5L , the half - life of ARPC2 is reduced ( 3 . 80 ± 0 . 23s ; Fig . 7d ) . Importantly , these isoform - specific diﬀerences in Arp2 / 3 - branch stability are dependent on cortactin as combined knockdown of ARPC1A / C5 and cortactin reduces the turnover rate of ARPC2 to 5 . 38 ± 0 . 23s ( Fig . 7d ) . Conversely , the stability of ARPC2 in actin tails increases towards control values in cells treated with RNAi against ARPC1B / C5L and cortactin . We next examined whether the loss of ARPC1A / C5 - or ARPC1B / C5L - containing Arp2 / 3 complexes reciprocallyaﬀectedthestabilityofcortactinintheactintail . Wefound that the half - life of cortactin in actin tails is 2 . 65 ± 0 . 2s ( Fig . 7e ) , which is faster than actin ( 7 . 43 ± 0 . 23s ; Fig . 7a ) , as previously seen in lamellipodia 49 and ARPC2 ( 5 . 53 ± 0 . 34s ; Fig . 7d ) . In the absence of ARPC1A / C5 , the half - life of cortactin in actin tails increases to 3 . 47 ± 0 . 2s ( Fig . 7e and Supplementary Fig . 5C ) . Conversely , it drops to 1 . 58 ± 0 . 08s when cells are treated with RNAi against ARPC1B and ARPC5L ( Fig . 7e and Supplementary Fig . 4C ) . Importantly , isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complexes did not impact on the peak recruitment of cortactin to actin tails ( Supplementary Fig . 5D ) . Cortactin is clearly stabilizing ARPC1B / C5L - and not ARPC1A / C5 - containing Arp2 / 3 complexes . Collectively our data suggest that cortactin diﬀerentially regulatesthebranchstabilityofthediﬀerentArp2 / 3complexesinactin tails by modulating the ability of coronin to promote actin filament debranching ( Fig . 7f ) . DISCUSSION Our observations demonstrate that the Arp2 / 3 complex in higher eukaryotes is actually a family of complexes with diﬀerent properties . Moreover , our analyses of the role of the diﬀerent ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms in actin - based motility of vaccinia have uncovered a previously unappreciated complexity in the regulation of Arp2 / 3 - generated actin networks . We found that all combinations of ARPC1 or ARPC5 isoforms produce functional Arp2 / 3 complexes that can accelerate the in vitro assembly of actin albeit with diﬀerent eﬃciencies . Consistent with this , all isoform combinations can promote actin - based motility of vaccinia . Unexpectedly , however , the isoform composition of the Arp2 / 3 complex also impacts on the disassembly of the actin network . The length of vaccinia - induced actin tails depends on the balance between the rate of new actin polymerization and filament disassembly along the tail . Our isoform depletion experiments demonstrate that the length of vaccinia actin tails represents the net result of the diﬀerent activities of these four Arp2 / 3 complexes . The fact that combined loss of ARPC1A / C5 or ARPC1B / C5L leads to actin tail lengths similar to loss of individual isoforms , however , implies that ARPC1A / C5 and ARPC1B / C5L complexes may be favoured . This suggests that the relative amounts of each isoform we have measured in our HeLa cells is not a predictor of the actual abundance of the diﬀerent Arp2 / 3 complexes . This situation is likely to be even more complex because there are two isoforms of Arp3 , potentially resulting in 8 possible diﬀerent Arp2 / 3 complex combinations ( Fig . 1a ) . It is also highly likely that the relative amounts of each isoform and the Arp2 / 3 complexes they form will vary between diﬀerent tissues types as well as during development . Our in vitro assays with defined recombinant complexes clearly demonstrate that the ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms aﬀect the ability of an N - WASP VCA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex to induce actin assembly . The high - aﬃnity VCA - binding sites of N - WASP and WAVE are at the interface between Arp2 and ARPC1 , which is fully exposed in the inactive open conformation of the Arp2 / 3 complex 50 – 53 . Diﬀerences in the ability of the ARPC1 isoforms to interact with N - WASP could account for the variation in actin assembly in our in vitro assays . However , our FRAP analysis suggests that this is not likely to be the case , as the dynamics of each isoform are similar . Consistent with this , all of the residues in ARPC1A and ARPC1B at this interface are identical , suggesting that aﬃnities for the VCA domain of N - WASP as well as WAVE are unlikely to be very diﬀerent . Indeed , mammalian WAVE1 and WASP family proteins all bind to purified Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complexes with similar aﬃnities even though they result in distinct nucleation activities 54 . Hence , subunit composition more likely impacts on NPF - dependent changes in conformation that lead to Arp2 / 3 activation and / or how the complex interacts with actin filaments . OurdebranchingassaysdemonstratethatARPC1B / C5Lcomplexes are inherently less stable than ARPC1A / C5 complexes ( Fig . 4c ) . These in vitro stabilities presumably reflect diﬀerences in Arp2 / 3 complex interactions with filaments , as ARPC1 and ARPC5 contact actin subunits in the long pitch helix of the filament 55 , 56 . However , in cells , our observations clearly demonstrate that cortactin stabilizes ARPC1B / C5L - containing Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Fig . 7d ) . Cortactin bound to ARPC1B / C5L complexes is also more stable than with NATURE CELL BIOLOGY ADVANCE ONLINE PUBLICATION 9 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved A RT I C L E S ARPC1A / C5 ( Fig . 7e ) . Our data also suggest that cortactin does not stabilize ARPC1A / C5 complexes , as depletion of cortactin with ARPC1B and ARPC5L leads to enhanced branch stability of the remaining ARPC1A / C5 complexes and the actin network it generates ( Fig . 7a , d ) . The enhanced stabilization of ARPC1B / C5L - containing complexes , which are more eﬃcient at nucleating actin filaments , results in slower disassembly of the actin network and therefore , longer tails ( Fig . 7f ) . Several studies including recent single - molecule imaging demonstrate that cortactin - facilitated displacement ofN - WASPfromtheArp2 / 3complexisrequiredfordaughterfilament elongation 22 , 24 , 57 , 58 . Furthermore , attachment to both the mother filament and the Arp2 / 3 complex allows cortactin to stabilize the complex at branch points 20 , 22 , 23 , 25 . Structural analysis and modelling of cortactin bound to the Acanthamoeba Arp2 / 3 complex at branch points reveals that it wraps around the complex contacting ARPC2 , ARPC4 , ARPC1 and ARPC5 subunits 47 . Changes in surface residues between the ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms presumably account for diﬀerences in the ability of cortactin to both target and stabilize isoform - specific Arp2 / 3 complexes . Cortactin also regulates coronin 1B - mediated actin disassembly by stabilizing Arp2 / 3 complexes at branch points 26 . However , we made the surprising discovery that the ability of coronin to promote actin tail disassembly is dependent on cortactin ( Fig . 6d ) . As cortactin has a 300 - fold higher aﬃnity for branch points compared with filament sides 22 , one possibility is that cortactin bound to Arp2 / 3 actually facilitates the recruitment of coronin specifically to branch points . As ARPC1A / C5complexesareinherentlystable ( Fig . 4c ) , lossofcortactin would only reduce coronin - mediated debranching of these complexes , thus resulting in wild - type length tails ( Fig . 7b ) . Taken together , our observations suggest cortactin has two functions ( Fig . 7f ) . First , cortactin bound to Arp2 / 3 complexes promotes the recruitment of coronin 1B / 1C to all branch junctions . Second , it preferentially stabilizes ARPC1B / C5L - over ARPC1A / C5 - containing complexes against coronin - mediated debranching . Detailed biochemical , structural and single - molecule analysis with defined Arp2 / 3 complexes in the presence of cortactin and coronin will now be required to confirm whether this is indeed the case . Such analyses may also provide much needed insights into the conforma - tional changes occurring in the Arp2 / 3 complex during its activation , association with and disassociation from actin filaments . Finally the Arp2 / 3 isoform - specific diﬀerences we have documented are unlikely toberestrictedtovirus - inducedactintails . WhetherparticularArp2 / 3 complexes at appropriate concentrations are better suited to certain cellular processes than others remains an interesting open question .

Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 10min , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton / PBS for 2min , blocked in cytoskeletal buﬀer ( 1mM MES , 15mM NaCl , 0 . 5mM EGTA , 0 . 5mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5mM glucose , pH6 . 1 ) containing 2 % ( v / v ) fetal calf serum and 1 % ( w / v ) BSA , for 15min . Dilutions of primary antibodies were determined empirically . Secondary antibody dilutions were always 1 : 500 or 1 : 200 in the case of secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa647 . Immunofluorescence images were acquired and figures prepared as described previously 41 , 62 . Cell lines and siRNA transfection . Stable HeLa cell lines expressing GFP – ARPC1A , 1B , C5 , 5L , ARPC2 – GFP , coronin - 1B – GFP , GFP – coronin - 1C , cortactin – GFP , Cherry – GFP PA – β - actin , LifeAct – RFP , ARPC2 – Cherry – GFP PA and cortactin – Cherry – GFP PA were generated by lentivirus infection ( Trono group second generation packaging system , Addgene ) followed by 1 µ gml − 1 puromycin selection . HeLa GFP – N - WASP cells have been described previously 38 . The following RNAi were used : All - Star control ( Qiagen , SI03650318 ) , siRNA against ARPC5 ( MU - 012080 - 00 - 0010 ) , ARPC5L ( MU - 014690 - 00 - 0010 ) , ARPC1A ( MU - 012263 - 02 - 0010 ) , ARPC1B ( M - 012082 - 01 - 0010 ) , ARPC2 ( M - 12081 - 00 - 0010 ) CORO1B ( M - 010493 - 01 - 0010 ) , CORO1C ( M - 017331 - 00 - 0010 ) , cortactin ( MU - 010508 - 00 - 0010 ) and cofilin 1 ( M - 012707 - 00 - 0010 ) were purchased from Dharmacon ( siGenome pools of 4 ) and used at a final concentration of 20nM . HeLa cells were transfected with HiPerFect ( Qiagen ) using the fast - forward method in 6 - well plates . Immunoprecipitation and GFP - Trap pulldown assays . HeLa cells were treated with 200nM latrunculin A ( Sigma ) for 1h and then lysed in TGH buﬀer ( 50mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 1 . 5mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 % glycerol , 1mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride , 1mM sodium vanadate and protease inhibitors ( Roche ) ) also containing 200nM LatA . The soluble fraction was pre - cleared with Protein A – Sepharose beads ( Sigma ) , incubated with polyclonal antibodies against ARPC1A , ARPC1B , coronin 1B and coronin 1C for 2h at 4 ◦ C with gentle rotation . Proteins bound to Fast - flow Protein A – Sepharose beads ( Sigma ) were then washed three times in TGH buﬀer . HeLa cells stably expressing GFP – ARPC1A , 1B , C5 or C5L were treated with 200nM latrunculin A for 1h and then lysed in GFP - Trap buﬀer ( 10mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 5mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % NP40 ) . The pulldown was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( ChromoTek ) . Immunoblot analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies . Lentivirus expression constructs . The pLVX – LifeAct – RFP was constructed in the same manner as pEL – LifeAct – Cherry 39 . The pLVX – GFP PA – Cherry – β - actin expression vector was created by digesting pEL – Cherry - GFP PA – β - actin ( ref . 39 ) with BglII / XbaI and ligating this into pLVX - puro vector ( Clonetech ) digested with BamHI / XbaI . Human ARPC2 and mouse cortactin were cloned into pLVX – C – Cherry – GFP PA or pLVX – C - term - GFP ( see below ) vectors using XhoI / EcoRI and EcoRI / NotI sites respectively . pLVX – C – GPAC was constructed by PCR of GPAC variant 1 and cloning this into pLVX – C – GFP ( ref . 63 ) through NotI / BamHI sites . Human ARPC5 , ARPC5L , ARPC1A and ARPC1B ( GeneArt , Invitrogen ) were cloned into the NotI / EcoRI sites of pLVX – N - term – GFP . The pLVX – N - term – GFP expression vector was constructed by digesting pLVX - puro ( Clonetech ) with XhoI / EcoRI , blunting and filling the ends followed by re - ligation to create an intermediate vector . The N - term – GFP – MCS was released from pE / L – N – GFP with BglII / BamHI and inserted into the BamHI site of the intermediate vector . Mouse coronin 1B ( IMAGE ID : 40130221 ) and coronin 1C ( IMAGE ID : 4167810 ) cloneswerepurchasedfromIMAGEClone . pLVX – mCoronin1B – GFPand pLVX – GFP – mCoronin1C were constructed by PCR of coronin image clones that weresubsequentlyclonedintoEcoRI / NotIsitesofpLVX – C - term – GFPorpLVX – N - term – GFP . The pLVX – C - term – GFP expression vector was constructed by digesting thepE / L – C - term - Cherry / GFPvectors 62 withXhoI / BamHIandcloningthisintothe same sites of pLVX puro and therefore retaining the MCS of pE / L . Baculovirus expression vectors of Arp2 / 3 subunits . Synthetic constructs of human ARPC1A , 1B , C2 , C3 , C4 , C5 , C5L , ACTR2 and ACTR3 were obtained from GeneArt , Invitrogen . The internal BstZ171 and BamHI sites in ARPC3 as well as the internal XmaI , ClaI and HindII sites in ARPC1A were removed by silent mutations . The multibac expression vector pFL ( ref . 64 ) was modified to remove an internal NotI site ( pFL (cid:49) NotI ) to use a NotI site in the multiple cloning sequence . The following expression vectors were constructed using the pFL (cid:49) NotI vector : pFL – ARPC2 – ACTR3 , pFL – ARPC4 – ARPC1A – TEV – STREP , pFL – ARPC4 – ARPC1B – TEV – STREP , pFL – ARPC3 – ACTR2 – ARPC5 and pFL – ARPC3 – ACTR2 – ARPC5L . ARPC2 , ARPC3 , ARPC4 and ARPC5 were cloned into XhoI / XmaI sites , ACTR2 , ACTR3 and ARPC5L into BamHI / NotI sites and ARPC1A or ARPC1B ( without a stop codon ) into BamHI / EcoRI sites . A TEV cleavage site followed by two STREP sequences were subsequently ligated C - terminally to ARPC1A and ARPC1B through EcoRI / NotI sites . To make pFL – ARPC3 – ACTR2 – ARPC5 , pFL – ARPC3 – ACTR2 and pFL – ARPC5 vectors were first constructed ; the former was digested with BstZ171 and SpeI ( within the multiplication module ) and the latter with BstZ171 and AvrII . The ARPC5 fragment was then inserted into the multiplication module . To make pFL – ARPC3 – ACTR2 – ARPC5 , pFL – ARPC3 – ACTR2 and pFL – ARPC5 vectors were first constructed ; the former was digested with BstZ171 and SpeI ( within the multiplication module , MM ) and the latter with BstZ171 and AvrII . The ARPC5 fragment was then inserted into the MM . To make pFL – ARPC3 – ACTR2 - ARPC5L , pFL – ARPC3 - ACTR2 and pFL – ARPC5L vectors were first constructed ; the former was digested with BstZ171 and the latter with BstZ171 and PmeI . The ARPC5L fragment was then inserted into the multiplication module . Expression and purification of Arp2 / 3 complexes . The Arp2 / 3 complexes were expressed in Sf21 insect cells maintained in SF900 - III medium ( Life Technologies ) using the MultiBac system 64 . The purification procedure was adapted from ref . 65 . In brief , each isoform complex was expressed by co - infection with 3 of the following 5 viruses : pFL – ARPC2 – Arp3 ; pFL – ARPC4 – ARPC1A – STREP or pFL – ARPC4 – ARPC1B – STREP ; and pFL – ARPC3 – ARP2 – ARPC5 or pFL – ARPC3 – ARP2 – ARPC5L at an equivalent MOI . Cells were grown for 72hr post - infection . The ARPC1A / ARPC1B subunits are C - terminally tagged with a TEV - cleavable double Strep for purification and detection . Infected Sf21 cells were pelleted and resuspended in Buﬀer A ( 50mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 100mM KCl , 5mM EGTA , 1mM EDTA , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 2mM ATP , 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) glycerol ) . A protease - inhibitor tablet ( Roche ) was added to quench protease activity . The cells were lysed by sonication and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 80 , 000 g for 30min . The soluble material was loaded onto a 1ml StrepTrap HP disposable 1ml column ( GE Healthcare ) at 1mlmin − 1 , washedandboundmaterialelutedwithBuﬀerAcontaining10mM D - Desthiobiotin ( Sigma—D1411 ) . The eluted material was further purified by cation exchange using a Mono S 5 / 50 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) ; eluted Arp2 / 3 complex was diluted twofold using the Mono S - dilution buﬀer ( 20mM MES pH 6 . 1 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 5mM EGTA , 1mMEDTA , 0 . 5mMDTT , 0 . 2mMATPand10 % ( v / v ) glycerol ) . Theprotein NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb3286 M E T H O D S mixture was loaded onto the Mono S column at 1mlmin − 1 using Buﬀer B ( 20mM MES pH 6 . 1 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 50mM KCl , 5mM EGTA , 1mM EDTA , 0 . 5mM DTT , 0 . 2mM ATP and 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol ) as running buﬀer and Buﬀer C ( 20mM MES pH 6 . 1 , 2mM MgCl 2 , 500mM KCl , 5mM EGTA , 1mM EDTA , 0 . 5mM DTT , 0 . 2mM ATP and 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol ) as high - salt buﬀer for elution . The complexes elutedaround200mMKCl . Thefractionscontainingall7subunitswerepooledand subjected to a final Superose12 ( 10 / 300 ) size - exclusion step using Buﬀer D ( 20mM MOPSpH7 . 0 , 100mMKCl , 2mMMgCl 2 , 5mMEGTA , 1mMEDTA , 0 . 5mMDTT , 0 . 2mM ATP , 5 % ( v / v ) ) as the final buﬀer . Aliquots of the purified complexes were flash - frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at − 80 ◦ C . Pyrene actin assembly assays . Actin polymerization kinetic experiments were monitored by the increase in fluorescence of 10 % pyrenyl - labelled actin ( exc = 365nm , em = 407nm ; ref . 66 ) . All experiments were carried out at 20 ◦ C , on a Safas Xenius FLX spectrofluorometer ( Safas ) , using a multiple sampler device . Polymerization assays were performed in F - buﬀer ( 5mM Tris - Cl pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM DTT , 100mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 ) . Actindebranchingassays . Actindebranchingassayswereperformedaspreviously described 42 . Actin ( 4 µ M , 10 % Alexa488 - labelled , 10 % pyrenyl - labelled ) was rapidly polymerizedinthepresenceofVCAandappropriateconcentrationsofrecombinantArp2 / 3 complexes to reach 90 % polymerization after 180s . Aliquots were removed from the solution at time intervals , supplemented with phalloidin , diluted 500 - fold , andprocessedforimageacquisitiononanOlympusIX71microscopewitha60 × oil objectiveandaCascadeIIEMCCD ( Photometrics ) camera . Thenumberofbranches per micrometre of actin filaments was calculated at each time point . The graph represents the branch density ( % ) , normalized such that the branch frequency at t = 0 is 100 % , versus time . The data are fitted using a single exponential . The assays wereperformedinduplicate , with10imagespertimepoint , andanalysedaltogether at each time point . At each time point , a total filament length of 3 , 000 – 20 , 000 µ m and about 400 branches at the earliest time were counted . Errors represent the standard deviation . Measuring abundance of endogenous ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms . RecombinantARPC1A – ARPC5andARPC1B – ARPC5Lcomplexes wereusedtoset up titration curves for STREP – ARPC1A , ARPC5 , STREP – ARPC1B and ARPC5L respectively . HeLa cells were lysed in Laemmli buﬀer and the concentration determined using Pierce 660nm reagent ( with Ionic Detergent Compatibility Reagent ) . In triplicate gels , 10 µ g of HeLa whole - cell extract was loaded in duplicate , followed by increasing amounts of the indicated recombinant Arp2 / 3 complex and the corresponding amounts of each isoform were calculated from the following molecular weights : ARPC1A – STREP ( 45810 . 8 ) , ARPC1B – STREP ( 45191 . 3 ) , ARPC5 ( 16320 . 42 ) and ARPC5L ( 16941 . 2 ) . Immunoblots were analysed by chemiluminescence on an ImageQuant system ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) and band intensities were quantified on ImageJ . The following antibodies were used for these quantifications : ARPC5 ( Synaptic Systems ) , ARPC5L ( Abcam , ab169763 ) , ARPC1A ( Sigma , HPA004334 ) , ARPC1B ( Sigma , HPA004832 ) . A standard curve for each isoform from each membrane was plotted and the amount of each isoform present in 1 µ g of HeLa extract was extrapolated from the appropriate standard curve . The number of moles per microgram of HeLa extract was subsequently determined . Basedonthenumberofmolesofeachisoformper1 µ gofHeLaextract , the probability of all 4 possible complexes was calculated as follows . The probability that a complex will contain C5 or C5L : P ( C5 ) = 2 . 82 / ( 2 . 82 + 1 . 59 ) ≈ 0 . 64 P ( C5L ) = 1 − P ( C5 ) ≈ 0 . 36 The probability that a complex will contain C1A or C1B : P ( C1A ) = 0 . 66 / ( 0 . 66 + 1 . 55 ) ≈ 0 . 3 P ( C1B ) = 1 − 0 . 3 ≈ 0 . 7 . The relative abundances of the 4 complexes : P ( C5 - C1A ) = P ( C5 ) × P ( C1A ) = 0 . 64 × 0 . 3 = 0 . 19 P ( C5 - C1B ) = P ( C5 ) × P ( C1B ) = 0 . 64 × 0 . 7 = 0 . 45 P ( C5L - C1A ) = P ( C5L ) × P ( C1A ) = 0 . 36 × 0 . 3 = 0 . 11 P ( C5L - C1B ) = P ( C5L ) × P ( C1B ) = 0 . 36 × 0 . 7 = 0 . 25 . Live cell imaging and photoactivation . To determine virus speeds under the various RNAi conditions , HeLa cells stably expressing LifeAct – RFP and infected withYFP – A3virus ( acoreviralprotein , 62 ) wereimaged8hpost - infectiononanAxio ObserverMicroscopecontrolledbySlidebook ( 3iintelligentimaginginnovations ) as previously described 39 , 41 . Two - minute videos were captured at 1s intervals and viral particles were tracked using Metamorph ( Molecular Devices ) . Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean and were analysed by one - way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test using Prism 6 ( GraphPad Software ) . Photoactivation experiments were performed on HeLa cells stably expressing Cherry – GFP PA – β - actin or other photoactivatable constructs and infected with the YFP – A3 virus 39 , 62 . Cherry – GFP PA – β - actin was activated using a focused 405nm laser . Fluorescence intensity profiles for each activation event were thresholded to remove background noise and normalized . A nonlinear regression analysis was applied to the resulting data , to fit an exponential curve using Prism 6 software ( GraphPad software ) to measure the rate of actin turnover . All videos were created with Metamorph ( Molecular Devices ) . FRAP experiments were performed using a vector high - speed point scanner on the same microscope . The GFP - tagged ARPC1 orARPC5isoformsignalswerebleachedfor100msat80 % 488nmlaserpower ( Box size of 8 ) , and its recovery was measured using Slidebook software and analysed as previously described 38 . Generation of actin tail profiles . Images of vaccinia - infected HeLa cells stably expressing GFP - tagged proteins ( N - WASP , ARPC2 , cortactin and coronin 1C ) were acquired using a Dual View Multichannel Imaging System ( Optical Insights ) for simultaneous acquisition of RFP and GFP emission . Images of Tetraspeck Fluorescent Microspheres ( Molecular Probes T14792 ) were used to form a calibration grid for channel alignment using a procedure similar to that described previously 67 . Automated tracking of virus particles was performed using a method similar to that described previously 68 . Vaccinia virus fluorescence intensity profiles were fitted with a Gaussian function . LifeAct , ArpC2 , cortactin and coronin 1C intensity profiles were fitted with an exponentially modified Gaussian function . N - WASPprofileswerefittedwithasumofaGaussianandanexponentiallymodified Gaussian . Toderivemodelintensityprofiles , dataweredeconvolutedwithaGaussian corresponding to the point spread function of the microscope , determined by imagingtetraspeckfluorospheresandfitting2DGaussianprofiles . Virustrajectories were then constructed using a nearest - neighbour approach , taking consideration of particle position and projected velocity . The resulting trajectories were then used to construct ROIs that trace actin tails . These ROIs were straightened , aligned and averaged to produce an average profile for each tail component . All algorithms were written in Java and implemented as plugins for ImageJ . Statistics and reproducibility . For actin tail lengths , 10 tails from 12 cells , were measured for each experimental condition . Each experiment was always performed3times ( 360tailscountedintotal ) . Datafrom3independentexperiments were combined and error bars represent s . e . m . for n = 360 tails . Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used to determine statistical significances , where ∗∗∗ P < 0 . 001 . Analysis of live cell imaging was always performed over three independent experiments and the data subsequently combined . The error bars represent s . e . m . for the indicated number of tails . 59 . Hiller , G . & Weber , K .
