Magnetic hyperthermia ( MHT ) has the potential to provide sufficient heat for TSLs to release their contents . For the first time , we used computational modeling to simulate MHT combined with intraperitoneal ( IP ) delivery of doxorubicin - loaded temperature - sensitive liposomes ( TSL - Dox ) . Results indicate that this combination therapy can improve treatment efficacy . The results also indicate that using large and octahedral MNPs can increase drug penetration by ten folds against normal IPC . Keywords — Magnetic hyperthermia ; Intraperitoneal chemotherapy ; Drug delivery ; Temperature - sensitive liposomes ; Combination therapy I . I NTRODUCTION Although intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( IPC ) has been used for patients with peritoneal metastasis , drug delivery into tumor nodules remains restricted . The lack of an efficient lymphatic system , the dense extracellular matrix of solid tumors , reverse interstitial velocity , and high interstitial pressure at the center of the tumor are the main drug barriers in the IPC approach [ 1 ] . Recently , TSLs have widely been used to reduce the toxicity of Dox . These drug carriers can be operated in mild hyperthermia temperatures ( 39 - 40°C ) [ 2 ] . Administration of TSLs has shown a great potential to increase drug delivery efficacy compared to conventional drug delivery approaches [ 3 - 5 ] . Despite the advances in various thermal therapy methods , the treatment of large tumors remains challenging [ 6 - 8 ] . Administration of TSL - Dox in combination with thermal therapy methods such as microwave ablation , radiofrequency ablation , laser , and high intensity focused ultrasound have shown successful results [ 9 ] . The synergistic effects of thermal therapy and chemotherapy can improve treatment efficacy and may reduce side effects [ 10 ] . Magnetic nanoparticles ( MNPs ) have been widely used in a number of biomedical applications [ 11 ] . MHT , which exploits the generated heat by MNPs under the alternative magnetic field ( AMF ) , is now in clinical trials [ 12 ] . MHT can induce cancer cell death where the elevation of temperature reaches 40 – 43°C , which is not possible at tumor boundary [ 13 ] . The combination of MHT with IP delivery of TSL - Dox may kill cancer cells in the margin of the ablation zone by targeted drug delivery to this region . In the current study , due to the complex interplay between the tissue heating and the drug transport process , mathematical modeling is employed to estimate the feasibility and performance of MHT in combination with the IP delivery of TSL - Dox . The performance of combination therapy is compared with conventional IPC . The effect of different types of MNPs is also examined to assess the impact of dissipation power on drug delivery efficacy . II . COMPUTATIONAL MODEL The simulation framework consists of several modules describing the different physical processes involved in a TSL - Dox and MHT combination treatment . Our proposed treatment consists of two steps . First , MNPs are injected into the tumor by direct injection , then MHT and IP delivery of TSL - Dox , perform for 60 min . The volume fraction of MNPs is assumed 0 . 033 . Fig . 1 is illustrated the axisymmetric 2D model and a schematic of the combination therapy . A circular tumor is considered with a radius of 0 . 75 cm in which a necrotic core with a radius of 0 . 375 cm is assumed . The coupled bio - heat transfer equation and mass transport equations are employed . The governing equations are solved using a finite element model ( FEM ) via Comsol Multiphysics 5 . 3 . A . Numerical simulation of MNPs injection The Brinkman equation is used to calculate pressure and velocity gradient inside the tumor during injection [ 14 ] : ρ ffi 𝜀 𝑖 𝜕 ( 𝑣 𝑖 ) 𝜕𝑡 = ∇ ∙ [ −𝑝𝐼 + 𝜇 𝜀 𝑖 ( ∇𝑣 𝑖 + ( ∇𝑣 𝑖 ) 𝑇 ) − 2𝜇 3𝜀 𝑖 ( ∇ ∙ 𝑣 𝑖 ) 𝐼 ] − ( 𝑣 𝑖 𝐾 𝑖−1 + 𝑄 𝑏𝑟 ( 𝜀 𝑖 ) 2 ) 𝑣 𝑖 .

Q br is the mass deposition in the porous tissues . The continuity equation is given as follows [ 14 ] : 𝜕 ( 𝜀 𝑖 ρ ffi ) 𝜕𝑡 + ∇ ∙ ( 𝑣 𝑖 ρ ffi ) = 𝑄 𝑏𝑟 (  ) The mass concentrations of the particles are the solution of the convection - diffusion equation as follows [ 20 ] : 𝜕𝐶 𝑀𝑁𝑃 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐷 𝑒𝑓𝑓 ∇ 2 𝐶 𝑀𝑁𝑃 − ∇ ∙ ( 𝑣 𝑖 𝐶 𝑀𝑁𝑃 )  (  ) where 𝐷 𝑒𝑓𝑓 is the effective diffusion of particles , which is calculated by the fiber - matrix model [ 21 ] . B . Hyperthermia and drug delivery Once the MNPs injection process is simulated by solving ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) , MHT is applied . Pennies bio - heat transfer ( PBHT ) equation is used to calculate temperature distribution during 60 min MHT as follows [ 22 ] : 𝜌𝐶 𝜕𝑇 𝜕𝑡 = 𝑘∇ 2 𝑇 + 𝜌 𝑏 𝐶 𝑏 𝜔 𝑏 ( 𝑇 𝑏 − 𝑇 ) + 𝑄 𝑚 + 𝛼𝑄 𝑀𝑁𝑃  (  ) where 𝜌 is the mass density , 𝐶 𝑏 is the specific heat capacity of the blood , k is the thermal conductivity , and 𝑄 𝑀𝑁𝑃 is the amount of power dissipation by MNPs under an alternating magnetic field . For 10 nm injection of MNPs , this value is determined by linear response theory [ 23 ] . Due to the fact that larger MNPs do not locate in a single domain , the value of volumetric heating rate dissipated by the 16 nm spherical and 22 nm octahedral MNPs is evaluated by previous experimental studies . Drug delivery is defined by mass transport equations for encapsulated liposome drugs ( L ) , free drugs ( F ) , bound drugs ( B ) , and the drugs internalized to cancer cells ( I ) . The four mentioned concentrations are modeled by solving ( 5 ) - ( 8 ) as follows [ 16 ] : 𝜕𝐶 𝐿 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐷 𝑒𝑓𝑓 ∇ 2 𝐶 𝐿 − ∇ ∙ ( 𝑣𝐶 𝑙 ) − 𝐾 𝐸𝐿 𝐶 𝐿 + Φ  (  ) 𝜕𝐶 𝐹 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐾 𝐸𝐿 𝐶 𝑙 −∇ ∙ ( 𝑣𝐶 𝐹 ) + 𝐷 𝑓 ∇ 2 𝐶 𝐹 − 1 𝜑 𝐾 𝑂𝑁 𝐶 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝐶 𝐹 + 𝐾 𝑂𝐹𝐹 𝐶 𝐵  (  ) 𝜕𝐶 𝐵 𝜕𝑡 = 1 𝜑 𝐾 𝑂𝑁 𝐶 𝑟𝑒𝑐 𝐶 𝐹 − 𝐾 𝑂𝐹𝐹 𝐶 𝐵 − 𝐾 𝐼𝑁𝑇 𝐶 𝐵  (  ) ∂C I ∂t = K INT C B . (  ) where 𝐾 𝐸𝐿 is a temperature - dependent release rate . This value is achieved from experimental data by Tagami et al . [ 24 ] . Φ , defined as the drug extravasation through the microvascular network and also drug drainage via the lymphatic system , is considered as [ 25 , 26 ] : Φ = Φ 𝐵 − Φ 𝐿  (  ) in which Φ 𝐵 is the drug released from the blood capillaries , and Φ 𝐿 is the drug drainage rate , which is neglected due to the lack of efficient lymphatic system in tumor [ 27 ] . The term Φ 𝐵 is presented as follows [ 25 , 26 , 28 ] : Φ 𝐵 = 𝜙 𝐵 ( 1 − 𝜎 𝑓 ) 𝐶 𝑝𝐿 + 𝑃𝑆 𝑉 ( 𝐶 𝑝𝐿 − 𝐶 ) 𝑃𝑒 𝑒 𝑃𝑒 −1  (  ) The parameters 𝐶 𝑝𝐿 , 𝜎 𝑓 , and P represent the concentration in plasma , the filtration reflection coefficient , and the microvessel permeability coefficient , respectively . The peclect number is defined ( as : 𝑃𝑒 = 𝜙 𝐵 ( 1 − 𝜎 𝑓 ) / 𝑃𝑆 𝑉 ) to consider the ratio between convection and diffusion through the capillary wall . The parameters used in mass transport equations are listed in Table 1 . III . VALIDATION The simulation results compared with the previously published experimental studies to assess the accuracy of the mathematical model . The temperature elevation during MHT is modeled under the same conditions as performed by Rodrigues et al . [ 29 ] . MHT is applied to a sarcoma 180 murine tumor , which 3 . 9 mg of MNPs injected intratumorally at three injection sites The temperature recorded during 30 min hyperthermia under the frequency of 301 kHz and 220 G field amplitude . The concentration of released drugs compared against experimental data to examine the accuracy of mass transport equations and parameters . Au et al . [ 1 ] examined the total concentration of drugs for a 4 mm tumor after 6 hr IPC when the concentration of drugs at the tumor periphery was equal to 45 µM . The rate of change in drug concentration and the difference between simulation results and experimental data was acceptable . IV . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The feasibility of the suggested treatment technique was assessed by two critical parameters are calculated . First , the area under the curve ( AUC ) which is the integration of the average intracellular concentration of Dox versus time . TABLE I .

Validation of proposed model with previous experimental data Second , the half - width parameter W1 / 2 is calculated as the distance across the tumor boundary , where the concentration equals the half external concentration . The performance of MHT is evaluated by the temperature profile inside the tumor . A . Temperature Profile Fig . 3 shows temperature profile in tumor and intraperitoneal space around it after 60 min MHT . Hyperthermia is performed at the frequency of 400 kHz and 13 . 5 kA / m external field intensity . Under these conditions , the effective power dissipation from MNPs per unit concentration is 1 . 27×107 W / m 3 . Temperature level increases up to 44 . 5 °C at the tumor center , but cancer cells at tumor boundary experience lower temperature , around 39 °C , which is not sufficient for killing cancer cells . These cells may cause tumors to grow after treatment . Due to the biological and clinical restrictions increasing magnetic field amplitude and frequency or the dose of MNPs is not possible [ 8 ] . B . Evaluation of the feasibility of using MHT during TSL - Dox IP delivery The performance of the IP administration of TSL - Dox , in combination with MHT , is examined in Fig . 4 . The average percentage of the released drug inside the tumor is increased . The higher temperature causes TSLs to release their content at the tumor boundary , and the mean concentration of free Dox increases to 0 . 0256 mol / m3 . As shown in Fig . 3 , hyperthermia temperature has the minimum value at the tumor boundary . Fig . 3 . Temperature profile after 60 min MHT ( f = 400 kHz , H0 = 13 . 5 kA / m ) Fig . 4 . The mean percentage of unencapsulated and encapsulated drug On the other hand , maximum drug accumulation occurred at tumor boundary in IPC injection ( Fig . 5 ) . This synergistic effect can lead to improving treatment efficacy . Increasing drug concentration at tumor borders can compensate for the lack of enough temperature for killing cancer cells . The drug delivery performance parameters , namely AUC and W1 / 2 , are presented in Figs . 6 ( a ) - ( b ) . The value of AUC in TSL - Dox administration is 3 . 5 - folds greater than IPC . Moreover , drug penetration depth increases from 0 . 075 mm to 0 . 6 mm by the administration of TSL - Dox combination therapy . These results demonstrate the effectiveness of MHT and TSL - Dox combination therapy compared to conventional IPC . Because TSLs are capable of providing a sustainable drug supply to enhance drug penetration and delivery to solid tumors . C . Enhancing energy dissipation rates by using larger and octahedral MNPs The drug release rate from TSLs increases with rising temperature . Previous studies indicate that larger MNPs can improve specific absorption rate , and optimal size depends on many factors such as particle size and magnetic field [ 30 ] . For instance , the optimal diameter is evaluated about 12 nm and 17 nm for very low and moderates magnetic field amplitude , respectively . Larger MNPs are not located in the single - domain zone ; therefore , linear response theory cannot be used to calculate power dissipation [ 30 ] . One other approach to increase the power dissipation of MPNs is using octahedral MNPs [ 31 ] . The temperature profile for 10 nm and 16 nm spherical MNPs are presented in Fig . 7 . To have an insight on the shape 2020 27th national and 5th International Iranian Conference on Biomedical Engineering ( ICBME 2020 ) , Amirkabir University of Technology , Tehran , Iran , 26 and 27 November 2020 3 Fig . 5 . The concentration of internalized drug after 60 min combination therapy effect , 22 nm octahedral Fe 3 O 4 , which have the same volume as 16 nm spherical MNPs , is also examined . The power dissipation from 10 nm spherical MNPs , under the frequency of 400 kHz and 13 . 5 kA / m external field is calculated according to linear response theory [ 23 ] . The specific absorption rate ( SAR ) of 22 nm octahedral and 16 nm spherical Fe 3 O 4 MNPs are reported 5 . 5×10 7 W / m 3 and 2 . 5×10 7 W / m 3 , respectively . The experimental measurements evaluated under 358 kHz frequency and 200 Oe field strength [ 31 ] . The maximum temperature at the center of the tumor increases to 47 °C and 58°C , by using larger spherical and octahedral MNPs , respectively . Higher temperature facilitates cell death process in internal regions of the tumor . As expected , the cancer cells at the tumor periphery expose to a higher temperature ( in the range 42 - 46 °C ) can increase the drug release rate without substantial damage to the healthy tissue around the tumor . The effect of higher power dissipation by the administration of larger spherical MNPs is shown in Fig . 8 . The value of AUC increases from 33 mol . s / m 3 to 53 mol . s / m 3 in the case of using 16 nm spherical MNPs compared to 10 nm spherical MNPs . As shown in Fig . 7 , octahedral MNPs have better heating efficacy in comparison with spherical ones at the same volume . The value of AUC for octahedral Fig . 6 . Drug delivery efficacy in conventional IPC and TSL - Dox , which is presented by AUC ( a ) and W1 / 2 ( b ) . Fig . 7 . The temperature profile for three different types of MNP MNPs indicates that the tumor exposes to higher drug concentration and reaches to 70 mol . s / m 3 . Fig . 9 illustrates the impact of MNPs ' shape and size on drug penetration depth . Large spherical MNPs improve drug penetration by 33 % , compared to 10 nm MNPs . The drug penetration depth is maximized by using octahedral MNPs . Administration of octahedral MNPs improves penetration depth ( W1 / 2 ) by 10 % , and the value of AUC increases by 24 % . It can be concluded that increasing drug penetration is more challenging . The best treatment efficacy achieves by TSL - Dox combination therapy by using octahedral MNPs , because the efficacy of both hyperthermia and TSL - Dox delivery improve . V . C ONCLUSION The presented mathematical model allows revealing the viability of using MHT during the IP delivery of TSL - Dox . Due to the different physiological barriers , drug delivery to solid tumors is very low in IPC . Although MHT has evolved into an established treatment modality , the treatment of large tumors remains challenging , mainly tumor borders area . The goal of the current study is to evaluate the performance of the IP delivery of TSL - Dox and MHT combination . The results show that about three folds increase in AUC of combination Fig . 8 .

The administration of more efficient MNPs can improve both the thermal treatment zone and the IP delivery of TSL - Dox . The value of AUC is seven - fold and 2 . 1 - fold greater than conventional IPC and combination therapy with small MNPs , respectively . The combination of MHT and IP delivery of TSL - Dox can compensate for the limitations of each method . R EFERENCES [ 1 ] J . L .
