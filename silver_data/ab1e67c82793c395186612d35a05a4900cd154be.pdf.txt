“ Cortactin and tumor invasiveness” Alissa M . Weaver * Department of Cancer Biology , Vanderbilt University Medical Center , Nashville , TN 37232 - 6840 , U . S . A . Abstract Cortactin is a cytoskeletal protein and src kinase substrate that is frequently overexpressed in cancer . Animal studies suggest that cortactin overexpression increases tumor aggressiveness , possibly through promotion of tumor invasion and metastasis . Recently , many studies have documented a role for cortactin in promoting cell motility and invasion , including a critical role in invadopodia , actin rich - subcellular protrusions associated with degradation of the extracellular matrix by cancer cells . Here , I review the evidence and potential mechanisms for cortactin as a critical mediator of tumor cell invasion . Keywords cortactin ; tumor ; invasion ; migration ; invadopodia 1 . Introduction Cortactin was first identified as one of the major substrates for src kinase [ 1 ] . Because it localized to cortical actin structures , it was named cortactin [ 2 ] . At that time , little was known about its function , except that it bound to actin filaments , had an SH3 domain , and was phosphorylated in its C - terminus by src kinase [ 2 ] . Subsequently , the cortactin gene was found to be identical with Ems1 [ 3 ] , a gene that is frequently overexpressed in breast and head and neck cancers due to its presence in the 11q13 amplicon [ 4 ] . 11q13 amplification has been frequently tied to poor prognosis , including association with higher pathological stage , lymph node and distant metastasis , and decreased survival [ 5 – 13 ] . Although many other genes are present within this amplicon , the consistent overexpression of cortactin in 11q13 - amplified tumors along with its ubiquitous presence in cell motility structures , such as lamellipodia and invadopodia [ 2 , 3 ] , have generated a great deal of interest in the role of cortactin in tumor invasion . 2 . Domain structure and binding partners Cortactin has four major domains of interest : the N - terminal acidic ( NTA ) and tandem repeats domains , and the C - terminal proline - rich and SH3 domains ( Fig 1 ) . The N - terminus has generally been thought of as the actin - assembly region of the molecule , as binding sites for the Arp2 / 3 complex and for actin filaments are found in the NTA and repeats domains , respectively ( Fig 1 ) . These binding sites are both necessary and sufficient for direct regulation of Arp2 / 3 - complex - mediated branched actin assembly ( see below ) [ 14 , 15 ] .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t cortactin to sites of dynamic actin assembly in cells is frequently mediated through the Arp2 / 3 and F - actin - binding sites [ 14 , 16 – 18 ] , suggesting that cortactin is both a sensor and regulator of branched actin assembly . The C - terminus is generally thought to be the regulatory or signaling end of the molecule , as the proline - rich domain contains phosphorylation sites for a number of kinases and the SH3 domain mediates binding to a variety of other signaling proteins ( Table 1 ) . However , many cytoskeletal and membrane trafficking proteins also bind to the SH3 domain of cortactin ( Table 1 ) , suggesting a potential scaffold or regulatory role for cortactin in cytoskeletal arrangement and membrane trafficking . Many of these cortactin binding partners , such as N - WASp , dynamin , and WIP , bind each other via separate direct interactions , suggesting that they may all function together in large multiprotein complexes . 3 . Cortactin as a regulator of branched actin assembly The role of cortactin in actin assembly remained elusive for almost a decade after its discovery , when it was identified as a binding partner for the Arp2 / 3 complex through mass spectrometry analysis [ 18 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex is the molecular machine that nucleates branched actin filament networks in cells [ 19 ] . Branched actin provides structural support for the plasma membrane and provides the force for such processes as protrusion of lamellipodia , vesicle trafficking , pathogen motility and formation of cell - cell junctions [ 19 ] . Although the critical and strong activators of the Arp2 / 3 complex are members of the Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome family of proteins ( WASps ) [ 19 , 20 ] , cortactin promotes weak activation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin nucleation by enhancing the key step of association of the Arp2 / 3 complex with the side of mother actin filaments [ 14 , 15 ] . This activity may indirectly enhance WASp - induced nucleation at a variety of sites throughout the cell [ 20 – 22 ] . In addition , cortactin stabilizes branched actin networks after they are formed [ 15 ] . Inhibition of debranching appears to be unique to cortactin and is likely to be a major function of cortactin throughout the cell , since cortactin localizes to all cellular branched actin networks [ 15 , 23 , 24 ] . Regulation of debranching may be a critical step in processes that are dependent on branched actin , as recent work in budding yeast demonstrates that an Arp2 / 3 complex mutant that is defective in debranching has defects in endocytosis and actin network disassembly [ 25 ] . In addition to directly regulating actin assembly by the Arp2 / 3 complex through its N - terminus [ 14 , 15 ] , several studies have demonstrated that cortactin can activate its binding partner N - WASp , by binding of the cortactin SH3 domain to the N - WASp proline - rich domain and relieving autoinhibition [ 26 – 28 ] . This effect is particularly strong in the presence of Nck , a tyrosine - kinase adaptor that binds to phosphorylated cortactin via an SH2 domain ( Fig 1 ) and links to N - WASp through WIP [ 28 ] . In cells , the importance of these interactions may vary , as in some studies the SH3 domain and / or src kinase phosphorylation sites ( that link to Nck ) are critical for actin - based phenotypes [ 26 , 29 , 30 ] , whereas in others only the N - terminus is required [ 16 , 31 ] . Thus , it is likely that cortactin may regulate actin assembly through multiple mechanisms , including stabilizing branches and enhancing Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation through direct interactions of the N - terminus , as well through activation of N - WASp via interactions at the C - terminus . 4 . Cortactin promotes cell migration The strong localization of cortactin to cell motility structures such as lamellipodia and invadopodia [ 2 , 3 ] sparked an early interest in the role of cortactin in cell migration and invasion . Indeed , overexpression of cortactin has been shown to enhance cell motility in a variety of assays , including transwell migration [ 16 , 32 ] , wound closure [ 26 , 33 ] , and single cell motility [ 16 ] . Conversely , siRNA against cortactin inhibits cell motility in many of the same assays [ 16 , 34 – 36 ] . During Drosophila melanogaster oogenesis , the migration of border cells in egg Weaver Page 2 Cancer Lett . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2009 July 8 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t chambers is impaired in cortactin - deficient flies , indicating that cortactin can regulate cell migration in vivo as well as in vitro [ 37 ] . Mechanistically , cortactin regulates the persistence [ 16 ] , but not the ability to induce lamellipodial protrusions [ 16 , 30 , 36 , 38 , 39 ] . Cortactin also affects the ability of cells to form a dominant lamellipodium in response to growth factor stimulation [ 38 ] . In addition , our laboratory found that cortactin promotes the formation of new adhesions at the cell edge , which is likely to contribute to both the lamellipodial persistence and migration phenotypes [ 16 ] . The lamellipodial persistence , adhesion , and cell motility defects can be fully rescued by cortactin molecules that contain only the Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin binding sites , suggesting that direct regulation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin assembly and / or stability by cortactin is responsible [ 16 ] . However , other laboratories have reported a role for cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation [ 33 , 35 ] , or SH3 domain interactions [ 26 ] in cell migration . Thus , cortactin may have different effects depending on the cellular context . This is not too surprising , since cortactin may affect actin assembly in different ways , e . g . via direct regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex by the N - terminus vs . activation of N - WASp through C - terminal interactions . In addition , cortactin has increasingly recognized cellular roles outside of the lamellipodia that might affect cell motility , such as in cell - cell adhesion [ 31 , 40 , 41 ] and membrane trafficking [ 42 – 46 ] . For example , regulation by cortactin of endocytosis of integrins and growth factor receptors [ 47 ] or secretion of molecules such as proteases [ 48 ] or extracellular matrix ( ECM ) could have major effects on cell motility that would be cell context dependent . Future studies should address these possibilities . 5 . Cortactin in invasion : invadopodia and ECM degradation In vivo , cell movement through tissues frequently requires the degradation of ECM . Cortactin appears to play a central role in this process , as it is important for invasion through matrix barriers , such as Matrigel - or gelatin - coated transwell filters [ 16 , 34 – 36 ] . At the subcellular level , cortactin is a critical component of invadopodia , actin - rich protrusions associated with ECM degradation [ 49 ] . Invadopodia were first identified in src kinase - transformed cells and are thought to constitute the invasive cellular machinery . They are characterized by the colocalization of many proteins that are found in focal adhesions and lamellipodia , as well as membrane trafficking proteins and proteases [ 49 ] . Related structures , podosomes , are found in osteoclasts , macrophages , and other normal cells that must cross tissue barriers or remodel ECM [ 49 , 50 ] . Cortactin is frequently used as an invadopodia marker , based on its strong localization to sites of focal ECM degradation ( Fig 2 ) . Studies in both podosomes and invadopodia indicate that cortactin is a universally important player in their function [ 30 , 48 , 51 – 54 ] . As in other areas of cortactin biology , there are multiple potential mechanisms for the strong effect of cortactin in this organelle . Cortactin may be acting directly to promote actin assembly at invadopodia puncta [ 55 ] . In osteoclasts , cortactin was found to be essential for the formation of actin - based podosomes , but not for other actin - based structures such as lamellipodia [ 30 ] . Similarly in src - transformed or overexpressing cells , cortactin downregulation reduces the number of actin - rich podosome rings [ 54 ] and invadopodia puncta [ 51 ] . Many key invadopodia proteins are also cortactin - binding partners , including N - WASp , WIP , dynamin , ASAP1 / AMAP1 , and src kinase [ 49 ] , suggesting that cortactin may play a scaffolding function in invadopodia . Consistent with that idea , mutations in the cortactin C - terminal phosphorylation and binding sites have strong effects on invadopodia number and function [ 54 , 56 ] . Regulation of membrane trafficking by cortactin is likely to be a critical component of invadopodia - associated ECM degradation . Recent live cell imaging studies from Susette Mueller’s laboratory demonstrate that cortactin recruitment precedes by a few minutes the Weaver Page 3 Cancer Lett .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t trafficking of proteases to future sites of ECM degradation [ 51 ] . Interestingly , the presence of both cortactin and strong phosphotyrosine staining at invadopodia puncta was shown by the same group to identify a subset of invadopodia that are actively degrading ECM , suggesting that phosphotyrosine signaling and cortactin may be critical components of delivery and / or activation of invadopodia proteases [ 57 ] . Consistent with that idea , our recent data indicate that cortactin is essential for the trafficking of the key invadopodia proteases , MT1 - MMP , MMP2 , and MMP9 in head and neck squamous carcinoma cells ( HNSCC ) [ 48 , 58 ] . Although invadopodia - like actin puncta can still be formed in cortactin - KD cells , MMPs no longer localize to them and cell - associated ECM degradation does not occur [ 48 , 58 ] . At this point it is unclear whether cortactin function at the Golgi apparatus [ 43 ] or within invadopodial protrusions is more important for the delivery and targeting of proteases to invadopodia . 6 . Cortactin function in tumors Cortactin is overexpressed in many types of human cancers , including head and neck and esophageal squamous carcinomas , colorectal , gastric , hepatocellular , breast and ovarian cancers [ 9 , 11 , 59 – 61 ] . Most frequently cortactin overexpression occurs through chromosomal amplification of the 11q13 . 3 region [ 9 ] , however , overexpression has also been reported in tumors without that amplification [ 61 , 62 ] . In HNSCC 30 – 40 % of tumors contain the 11q13 amplicon and it clearly correlates with poor patient prognosis , including decreased survival [ 5 – 8 , 11 – 13 ] . In addition to cortactin , a number of interesting genes are present in this amplicon , including TPC2 , ORAOV1 / TAOS1 , FGF4 , CCND1 , FGF19 , FGF3 , FLJ10261 , FADD , PP1A1 , TMEM1GA , and SHANK2 [ 63 ] . Of these , cyclinD1 and EMS1 / cortactin have been considered to be the best candidates for promoting tumor aggressiveness , since unlike many of the other genes in the amplicon they are consistently overexpressed upon amplification [ 64 ] . Between these two genes , cortactin has been more highly correlated with poor prognosis in HNSCC and estrogen receptor - negative breast cancers , whereas cyclin D1 has been associated with poor prognosis in estrogen receptor - positive breast cancers [ 10 , 11 , 59 , 65 ] . However , since they are frequently overexpressed and amplified together they may function synergistically in many situations . Although there have been few studies to address the role of coexpressed 11q13 genes , Timpson et al . recently reported that cooverexpression of cyclinD1 and cortactin in HNSCC cells promotes resistance to gefitinib , an EGF receptor antagonist drug , as defined by IC50 for proliferation [ 66 ] . Rothschild et al . examined 11q13 - amplified HNSCC cells and found that cortactin plays a generally important role in migration and invasion in this context and also promotes resistance to gefitinib - induced inhibition of migration ; however it is unclear whether any of the other genes in the amplicon participate in this phenotype [ 35 ] . A recent study in HNSCC reports increased RNA expression of 6 additional genes within the 11q13 . 3 amplicon , suggesting a potential role for additional gene products in 11q13 - driven tumor progression [ 67 ] . Interestingly , mRNA for the cortactin binding partner SHANK2 was not significantly elevated , despite the presence of the SHANK2 gene within the amplicon and the validation of cortactin overexpression in the amplified cells [ 63 , 67 ] . A few studies have examined the function of cortactin in tumors grown in mice . In a spontaneous model of breast tumorigenesis , expression of cortactin under the MMTV promoter does not increase the number of new tumors , either in the absence or presence of cyclin D1 overexpression [ 68 ] . Thus , cortactin is unlikely to act as a tumor initiator . Since 11q13 amplification usually occurs as a late genetic change in cancer [ 9 , 69 , 70 ] , this finding is not inconsistent with the known biology and suggests that cortactin expression may be most important in promoting tumor progression . Experimental metastasis experiments using tail vein injection of breast or esophageal squamous carcinoma cells demonstrated that overexpression of cortactin increased the number of metastases to bone [ 71 ] or lung [ 60 ] , respectively . Overexpression of a cortactin with mutations in the src kinase phosphorylation Weaver Page 4 Cancer Lett . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2009 July 8 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t sites led to decreased metastasis in the breast cancer model [ 71 ] . In a third study , orthotopic injection of hepatocellular carcinoma cells overexpressing cortactin into the liver led to increased intrahepatic metastasis , compared to control cells [ 72 ] . All three of these studies examined the role of cortactin in tumor growth . However , whereas an increase in tumor size was reported for subcutaneously - injected esophageal cancer cells [ 60 ] , no change in size was found for tumors grown from orthotopically injected breast or hepatocellular cancer cells [ 71 , 72 ] . Thus , the strongest in vivo evidence is currently in support for a role for cortactin in metastasis , consistent with its well - characterized cell biological roles in cell motility and ECM degradation . 7 . Posttranslational modification of cortactin Cortactin is posttranslationally modified by many different kinases , including the tyrosine kinases src , fer , abl , fyn , syk , met , along with the serine / threonine kinases Erk , PAK , and MLCK [ 73 , 74 ] . Of these , the best characterized sites are in the C - terminus and include Y421 , Y466 , and Y482 that are phosphorylated by src family kinases [ 33 ] and S405 and S418 that are phosphorylated by Erk family kinases [ 27 , 75 ] . In the N - terminus , PAK phosphorylates cortactin on S113 in the first actin binding repeat , an interaction that leads to inhibition of actin - binding by cortactin [ 76 ] . Phosphorylation site mapping by mass spectrometry revealed additional sites , many of which are located in or near critical binding sites for the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments [ 77 ] . Because cortactin was originally identified from a phosphotyrosine Western blot screen for src kinase substrates [ 1 ] , the three src kinase phosphorylation sites [ 33 ] have been heavily studied . Those sites were subsequently shown to be phosphorylated by additional kinases , including Fer and Abl [ 74 , 78 ] . In vitro , the domain that contains these sites is not required for direct regulation of Arp2 / 3 activity by cortactin [ 14 , 15 ] . However , src phosphorylation may oppose the reported effect of Erk phosphorylation in promoting accessibility of the cortactin SH3 domain to binding partners such as N - WASp [ 27 ] . In addition , tyrosine phosphorylation of Y421 occurs first [ 79 ] and is thought to create an SH2 domain - binding site with affinity for additional signaling proteins such as Crk , Abl kinase , and Nck [ 80 ] . The interaction with Nck can lead to recruitment and activation of N - WASp by cortactin [ 28 ] . In cells , phosphorylation of cortactin by Abl is dependent on the presence of src kinases and is important for PDGF - induced dorsal wave formation [ 74 ] . However , since src kinase is important for separate activation of Abl downstream of growth factors [ 81 , 82 ] , the requirement for src kinase may not be for direct phosphorylation of cortactin . Consistent with that concept , cortactin is more efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by Abl than by Src kinase [ 74 ] . Based on the importance of the cortactin C - terminus in binding to a variety of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins , the strength of C - terminal phosphorylation mutant phenotypes might be indicative of the relative importance of cortactin as a scaffolding molecule at various subcellular sites . For example , cortactin C - terminal domains and phosphorylation sites were found to be important for invasive functions such as podosome - associated ECM degradation and experimental metastasis [ 53 , 54 , 56 , 71 ] , suggesting that ECM degradation may require cortactin to bring together C - terminal binding partners such as src kinase , dynamin , and N - WASp . By contrast , expression of C - terminal point or deletion mutants of cortactin have thus far given more modest and variable cell motility and adherens junction phenotypes than cortactin molecules with mutations in the N - terminal Arp2 / 3 complex or F - actin binding sites [ 16 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 41 ] . In these latter contexts , cortactin may function primarily to regulate branched actin stability or assembly through direct interactions with Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments . Recently , posttranslational modification of the N - terminus has been reported . A number of phosphorylation sites are located in key regions , such as in the Arp2 / 3 binding acidic domain Weaver Page 5 Cancer Lett . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2009 July 8 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t or in the critical 1 st – 4 th actin binding repeats [ 18 , 76 , 77 ] . Most of the kinases responsible for these N - terminal phosphorylations are unknown , with the exception of PAK . The PAK phosphorylation site is located in the first actin - binding repeat and has been shown to modestly affect the affinity of cortactin for actin filaments [ 76 ] and regulate invadopodia activity in melanoma cells [ 56 ] . Interestingly , acetylation may also regulate actin assembly by cortactin , as HDAC6 was recently shown to affect the ability of cortactin to bind to actin filaments by modifying a charge patch in the repeats region [ 83 ] . 8 . Future prospects In the 15 years since its identification as a src kinase substrate , cortactin has generated a great deal interest in the actin assembly and signaling fields . Indeed it appears to be a key regulator of branched actin assembly at a variety of subcellular sites , including in lamellipodia , invadopodia , cell - cell junctions , and at sites of vesicle trafficking . At this point , it is unclear which of the multiple potential mechanisms that have been demonstrated in vitro are operative in different cellular functions , e . g . direct or indirect activation of Arp2 / 3 complex , stabilization of branches and / or as a scaffolding protein . Careful studies with reexpression of mutant cortactin molecules in cortactin - deficient cells may provide some insight in this respect by demonstrating which binding partners are required for specific biochemical and cellular functions . Another important area of future research is likely to be investigation of the interactions between cortactin and cellular membranes , since cortactin may act as a bridge between branched actin and membrane trafficking molecules at a variety of sites . In tumors , cortactin is frequently overexpressed , usually through 11q13 amplification . To date , there have been few studies examining the role of cortactin in tumor function . Of these , most support a strong role for cortactin in tumor metastasis [ 60 , 71 , 72 ] but not in tumor initiation [ 68 ] . However , more studies are needed to understand the role of cortactin in diverse tumor types and microenvironments . In addition , it is not clear which of the many cellular functions or binding domains of cortactin is operative in promoting in vivo aggressiveness . Finally , the role of cortactin in the context of 11q13 - amplified tumors is not understood , since most studies have not used 11q13 - amplified cells . Given the strong correlation of 11q13 amplification with poor patient prognosis , this is clearly an important area for future research . Ultimately , connecting the cell biology of cortactin function in a variety of contexts with in vivo tumor studies may lead to rational therapeutic strategies for patients with 11q13 - amplified tumors .

Cortactin domain structure and binding partners Cortactin structure and domains is depicted in bright blue . Actin filaments ( F - actin ) is in light blue . Cortactin binding partners are indicated by labeling within the yellow boxes . The N - terminus of cortactin is composed of the N - terminal acidic ( NTA ) domain and the cortactin repeats ( each repeat is represented by a numbered diamond ) region . These two domains are notable for binding Arp2 / 3 complex and F - actin , respectively . The repeat is depicted binding to F - actin , because it is essential for that interaction ; however , the other repeat regions contribute to binding affinity [ 18 ] . In the C - terminus , the proline rich region contains well - characterized serine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites . SS indicates the Erk S405 and S418 sites , whereas YYY indicates the Y421 , Y466 , and Y488 sites that are phosphorylated by src and the other tyrosine kinases indicated in the yellow box . Some of the cytoskeletal , membrane trafficking , and signaling proteins that bind to the SH3 domain are indicated in the yellow box below it . Biochemical activities regulated by the N - terminus and C - terminus are indicated at the bottom of the figure . For a full listing of binding partners , see Table 1 .

Cortactin is a strong invadopodia marker Primary head and neck squamous carcinoma cells were isolated from tumors and plated , without previous culture , on coverslips coated with a thin film of crosslinked gelatin overlaid with FITC - Fibronectin , as previously described [ 48 ] . After 36 h , cells were fixed and immunostained with 4F11 mAb against cortactin , followed by an anti - mouse AlexaFluor - 633 secondary antibody ( Invitrogen ) ( blue in merge ) , and stained for actin filaments with rhodamine - phalloidin ( red in merge ) . Degraded areas of ECM are evident as dark holes in the FITC - Fibronectin ( green in merge ) image . An arrow points to an example invadopodia in each of the separated and merged images . Note the colocalization of cortactin and actin punta with focal degradation of the ECM . Arrowheads in the cortactin image point out cortactin localization to other sites of branched actin assembly : lamellipodia at the edge of the cell and cell - cell junctions . Scale bar = 10 µm .
