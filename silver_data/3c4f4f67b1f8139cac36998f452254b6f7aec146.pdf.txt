Parton 2 , 3 & Satyajit Mayor 1 , 7 Using real - time TIRF microscopy imaging , we identify sites of clathrin and dynamin - independent CLIC / GEEC ( CG ) endocytic vesicle formation . This allows spatio - temporal localisation of known molecules affecting CG endocytosis ; GBF1 ( a GEF for ARF1 ) , ARF1 and CDC42 which appear sequentially over 60 s , preceding scission . In an RNAi screen for BAR domain proteins affecting CG endocytosis , IRSp53 and PICK1 , known interactors of CDC42 and ARF1 , respectively , were selected . Removal of IRSp53 , a negative curvature sensing protein , abolishes CG endocytosis . Furthermore , the identi ﬁ cation of ARP2 / 3 complex at CG endocytic sites , maintained in an inactive state reveals a function for PICK1 , an ARP2 / 3 inhibitor . The spatio - temporal sequence of the arrival and disappearance of the molecules suggest a mechanism for a clathrin and dynamin - independent endocytic process . Coincident with the loss of PICK1 by GBF1 - activated ARF1 , CDC42 recruitment leads to the activation of IRSp53 and the ARP2 / 3 complex , resulting in a burst of F - actin polymerisation potentially powering scission .

Dynamin is responsible for vesicle scission in CME 6 , 7 and a host of clathrin - independent endocytic ( CIE ) pathways , such as the caveolar and fast endophilin - mediated endocytic pathway 8 – 10 . On the other hand , among CIE pathways , the CLIC / GEEC [ clathrin and dynamin - independent carriers which form GPI - enriched endocytic com - partments ; CG ] pathway functions independent of both clathrin and dynamin in multiple cell types and contexts 11 – 17 , while it is not present in others 18 . The actin polymerisation machinery has been implicated in the functioning of many CIE pathways at different stages 13 , 19 . Our focus , the CG pathway , is regulated by the small GTPases , ARF1 ( ADP - ribosylation factor 1 ) and CDC42 ( cell division control protein 42 ) 11 – 16 . It is responsible for the uptake of many glycosylphosphotidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins , a major fraction of the ﬂ uid phase , toxins such as Helicobacter pylori vacuolating toxin A 20 , cholera toxin 21 and viruses like adeno - associated virus 2 22 . The CLICs are formed in a polarised manner at the leading edge of migrating cells 23 and , the resulting GEECs subsequently fuse with the sorting endocytic vesicles via a Rab5 / phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase - dependent mechanism 24 . The CLICs / GEECs are high capacity endocytic carriers turning over the entire membrane surface in 12 min in ﬁ broblasts , highlighting the role of CG pathway in regulating membrane homoeostasis 23 . Recent evidence suggests that this is required for generating a tubular vesicular endocytic network during cytokinesis 25 and serves to deliver ligands to their signalling receptors in a common endocytic compartment 26 . The molecular machinery to form a CG endocytic vesicle involves activating ARF1 at the plasma membrane by GBF1 ( Golgi - speci ﬁ c brefeldin A resistance factor 1 ) 16 , a speci ﬁ c ARF - GEF ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) . GTP – ARF1 recruits ARHGAP21 ( a RhoGAP for CDC42 ) , which removes CDC42 from the membrane 14 . Cholesterol removal , in addition , reduces the recruitment of ARF1 and CDC42 , along with accelerated cycling of CDC42 13 , 14 . Lastly , the CG pathway requires dynamic actin since both stabilisation and de - polymerisation of actin ﬁ laments was found to affect endocytosis 13 . By visualising a forming CG endocytic vesicle , we wanted to understand the molecular mechanism responsible . We adapted a pH pulsing protocol that exploits the pH - sensitive properties of super ecliptic GFP ( SecGFP ) 27 , previously deployed to study CME 4 , 28 , 29 . We tagged the GPI - anchor with SecGFP to make model cargo SecGFP - GPI to assay , in real time , the sites of endocytic vesicle formation . We found that the CG endocytic vesicle formation was initiated by the accumulation of ARF1 / GBF1 followed by CDC42 and F - actin while dynamin and cla - thrin did not associate with forming endosomes . Hence , in the absence of a discernable coat 23 , alternate candidate proteins by generating / stabilising membrane curvature can assist in endocytic vesicle formation such as Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain - containing proteins ( BDPs ) 30 . Although several BDPs are involved in the CME pathway , only one has been identi ﬁ ed to be associated with the CG endocytic pathway so far 31 . Using RNAi - screening , we identi ﬁ ed two BDPs in particular , that affected CG endocytosis downstream of ARF1 and CDC42 . First , a CDC42 interaction partner and I - BAR protein , IRSp53 ( Insulin - responsive protein of mass 53 kDa ) was found to be necessary for CG endocytosis . Importantly , IRSp53 removal resulted in the disappearance of CLICs and loss of a GBF1 - dependent endocytic pathway . Second , an ARF1 interactor , PICK1 ( protein interacting with C kinase 1 ) emerged as a regulator of ARP2 / 3 activity in the early phases of CG vesicle formation . Lastly , ARP2 / 3 , an interaction partner of both IRSp53 and PICK1 , accumulated at the forming CG endocytic site and decreased CG endocytosis when inhibited . Together , the spatio - temporal dynamics of these proteins provided a mechanistic understanding of the forming CG endocytic vesicle . Results pH pulsing assay detects nascent CG endocytic sites . To monitor endocytic vesicle formation in real time , we employed the pH - sensitive ﬂ uorescence of super ecliptic pHlourin GFP ( SecGFP ) 27 attached to a GPI - anchor ( SecGFP - GPI ) to differ - entiate cell surface - resident molecules from the newly internalised molecules . The ﬂ uorescence of SecGFP is quenched reversibly when exposed to pH 5 . 5 4 , 27 – 29 . SecGFP - GPI expressed in AGS ( human gastric cell line ) was endocytosed along with the CG cargo , ﬂ uid phase ( 10 kDa dextran ) , but not with CME cargo , TfR , at both 37 °C and 30 °C ( Supplementary Fig . 1a – c and Supplementary Information ( S . I . ) ) as shown previously 15 , 32 . Endocytic events were identi ﬁ ed by alternately exposing the cells to buffers equilibrated to pH 7 . 3 ( pH 7 ) or pH 5 . 5 ( pH 5 ) every 3 s at 30 °C ( Fig . 1a , Schematic and Supplementary Movies 1 – 2 ) . SecGFP - GPI - containing endocytic events occurring during exposure to pH 7 remained ﬂ uorescent due to their near neutral luminal pH right after formation . However , the buffer exchange from pH 7 to pH 5 quenched the ﬂ uorescence of cell surface SecGFP - GPI . This enabled visualisation of the newly formed endocytic vesicle . The identi ﬁ cation of the site of endocytic vesicle formation paved the way for the character - isation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of molecular players by the co - expression of a ( mCherry / TagRFPt / pRuby ) - tagged molecule of interest , ‘ X - FP ’ ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Movies 1 – 2 ) . The dynamics of X - FP were extracted by looking at the history of the region , where vesicle formation was detected ( Fig . 1a montage ( bottom ) , see Methods and S . I . ) . To rule out the effect of pH 5 on the rate of endocytosis , we pre - treated the cells with either pH 5 or pH 7 buffer , followed by 5 - min pulse in pH 7 buffer and found no difference in CG endocytosis ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 1e ) . The pH pulsing movies were analysed using semi - automated scripts ( see Methods and S . I . ) . Brie ﬂ y , the centroid of new spots appearing in the pH 5 channel provided a ﬁ duciary marker for the time and location of the nascent endocytic vesicle ( Supplementary Fig . 1d , step 1 and S . I . ) . The relative enrichment of SecGFP - GPI and X - FP at the endocytic site was determined by normalising the average ﬂ uorescence of the nascent endocytic spot to its local background annulus ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , d , step 2 – 3 and see S . I . ) . The spots were then put through a series of automated and manual checks . The automated check ensured that the pH 5 intensity of the new spot had ( i ) signi ﬁ cantly higher intensity than the background , ( ii ) persisted for at least 6 s and ( iii ) did not show an increase in intensity in the subsequent frame . Subsequently , a manual check was performed on the montages , ( i ) to remove any false positives that might have been missed by the automated check and ( ii ) to classify the new SecGFP - GPI spots into two groups based on whether X - FP co - detection was observed or not ( see S . I . ) . The data at the site of the spot were represented as the average fold change over the surrounding background , as a function of time ( Fig . 1b , solid traces ) , and compared to the average fold change of arbitrary regions within the cell ( ‘ Random ’ ) ( Fig . 1b , dashed traces ) . The pro ﬁ le obtained ( pooled from multiple cells ) represented a spatial and temporal pro ﬁ le of the X - FP at SecGFP - GPI endocytic sites . Using the pH pulsing assay , we found that the rise in pH 7 SecGFP - GPI intensity occurred only ~ 3 s prior to vesicle ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 03955 - w 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 1835 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 018 - 03955 - w | www . nature . com / naturecommunications generation as opposed to nearly 40 s for CME , followed by monitoring SecGFP - TfR internalisation ( ref . 4 and Supple - mentary Fig . 2c ) . Furthermore , we observed a poor correlation ( r = 0 . 3 ) between pH 7 vs . pH 5 intensity per endosome , indicating that SecGFP - GPI is endocytosed without a major concentration in the endocytic vesicle ( Fig . 1c ) . In comparison to CME , it should be noted that we faced two main challenges , ( i ) lack of a cytoplasmic marker ( for e . g . , clathrin ) for the endocytic site , ( ii ) lack of strong concentration of the cargo prior to the endocytic vesicle pinching . Regardless , the protocol developed provided a reliable real - time assay for studying the spatio - temporal dynamics of the internalisation of GPI - anchored proteins ( see , S . I . ) .

We visualised the temporal dynamics of co - expressed CDC42 at the site of formation of nascent SecGFP - GPI endocytic vesicles . TagRFPt - CDC42 recruitment was quanti ﬁ ed as average fold accumulation of CDC42 relative to the local background in all the endocytic events recorded over a 40 s time window straddling the endocytic event . A signi ﬁ cant change in the intensity of CDC42 began at around − 9 s and peaked around 0 to + 3 s ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . Based on the presence or absence of a co - detected CDC42 spot ( within − 18 to + 18 s time window ) at the endocytic site , we identi ﬁ ed two populations via manual classi ﬁ cation ( see S . I . for a detailed description ) . We called them CDC42 Coloc ( co - detection of CDC42 and SecGFP - GPI ) and CDC42 NoColc ( the remainder ) . We compared the fold accu - mulation of all the CDC42 spots ( CDC42 All ) , CDC42 Coloc and CDC42 NoColoc with the Random . While the CDC42 Coloc pro ﬁ le was similar to that of CDC42 All , the CDC42 NoColoc pro ﬁ le was comparable to the Random ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) . Thus , the endocytic sites detected by our assay consisted of two populations wherein one fraction exhibited an accumulation of CDC42 while the second fraction failed to show a discernable accumulation . CDC42 Coloc corresponded to the 56 % ( of the CDC42 All ) SecGFP - GPI endocytic sites . As the removal of the events which did not coincide with the presence of CDC42 did not alter CDC42 recruitment pro ﬁ le ( compare , Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , they were discarded from further ana - lysis . While the reasons for not detecting CDC42 at all endocytic events is a function of both the signal and noise in the data , it may also re ﬂ ect a genuine lack of recruitment at some endocytic events ( see S . I . for a detailed explanation ) . Henceforth , for all X - FPs , we report pH pulsing traces that were classi ﬁ ed as co - detected with the SecGFP - GPI ( see Methods , S . I . and Table 1 , for methods and statistical details and analysis ) . We next examined another CG pathway regulator , ARF1 14 , and found that mCherry - ARF1 was already accumulated at the forming CG endocytic sites at − 36 s and peaked at 0 s ( Fig . 1e , Supplementary Fig . 6a and Table 1 ) . Predictably , mCherry - GBF1 , an ARF1 - GEF 16 , was also recruited to SecGFP - GPI spots ( Fig . 1f , Supplementary Fig . 6b and Table 1 ) . The temporal pro ﬁ le of GBF1 was correlated to ARF1 ( r = 0 . 6 , Table 2 ) . When we extended the time window of observation for ARF1 and GBF1 further back in time ( nearly 60 s before scission ) , we concluded that the accumulation of ARF1 and GBF1 at CG endocytic sites initiates as early as − 54 s ( Supplementary Fig . 2f – g ) . In absence of other molecules upstream of GBF1 and ARF1 , this pair currently serves as the earliest initiators of the CG endocytic pathway . Furthermore , when we assessed the ultrastructure of newly formed ﬂ uid - ﬁ lled endosomes by electron microscopy ( EM ) 23 in cells treated with the small - molecule inhibitor of GBF1 , LG186 33 , the number of CLICs and ﬂ uid uptake was drastically reduced , whereas , CME - derived vesicles and uptake appeared relatively unaffected ( Supplementary Fig . 1e – f ) . In contrast to ARF1 , GBF1 and CDC42 , we did not observe a frequent recruitment of clathrin and dynamin to the CG endocytic sites . The recruitment pro ﬁ le was comparable to random for > 65 % endocytic events for both mCherry - clathrin and dynamin ( Supplementary Fig . 2d – e and Table 1 ) . The remainder of the pro ﬁ les exhibited high levels of clathrin and dynamin at SecGFP - GPI endocytic sites . Never - theless , both fraction showed a temporal trend similar to that observed for random ( Supplementary Fig . 2d – e , compare grey , blue and random traces ) . Conversely , mCherry - dynamin was recruited to SecGFP - TfR endocytic sites proximal to scission in 80 % of the cases ( Supplementary Fig . 2c ) in agreement with a previous study 4 . Despite being responsible for the timed removal of CDC42 from the plasma membrane 14 , ARF1 ( and GBF1 ) was recruited long before the recruitment of CDC42 . The pH pulsing analysis thus revealed a surprising facet of the recruitment of ARF1 ( and GBF1 ) , which suggested a CDC42 - independent function ( s ) for ARF1 in CG endocytosis . Taken together , these results establish a reliable real - time imaging assay to follow newly formed CG endocytic vesicles containing SecGFP - GPI , correlated with recruitment of its known regulators , ARF1 , GBF1 and CDC42 . Identi ﬁ cation of BAR domain proteins in CG endocytosis . CLICs , visualised within 15 s of their formation , have a pleomorphic tubular appearance and lack a discernable protein coat when visualised by EM 21 , 23 . This prompted us to investigate Fig . 1 Identi ﬁ cation of newly formed SecGFP - GPI endocytic vesicles using a pH pulsing assay . a Schematic ( top panel ) of the pH pulsing assay depicting the effect of pH on SecGFP - GPI ﬂ uorescence during endocytic vesicle budding .

Additionally , BDPs contain domains that can bind lipids and / or regulate actin machinery , including RhoGTPases 30 . Thus , we performed a dsRNA screen in S2R + cells 15 , 16 to identify the BDPs involved in CG endocytosis using GBF1 ( garz ) and GFP dsRNA as positive and negative control , respectively . The screen yielded 10 ‘ hits ’ which affected ﬂ uid - phase uptake ( Fig . 2a , b and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) .

To address the function of IRSp53 we compared endocytosis between mouse embryonic ﬁ broblasts ( MEFs ) generated from IRSp53 − / − mice ( IRSp53 − / − MEFs ) and IRSp53 − / − IRSp53WT addback MEFs ( IRSp53WT MEFs ) 42 . Loss of IRSp53 caused a signi ﬁ cant reduction in ﬂ uid - phase uptake , without affecting TfR internalisation ( Fig . 3b ) .

By contrast , GBF1 inhibition in IRSp53WT MEFs decreased ﬂ uid - phase uptake to the levels observed in IRSp53 − / − MEFs ( Fig . 3c ) while endocytosed TfR remained unaffected ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . We con ﬁ rmed the lack of the CG endocytic pathway in IRSp53 − / − MEFs by ultrastructural analysis of endocytic structures marked by the ﬂ uid - phase marker , HRP using EM 14 , 23 . We observed a signi ﬁ cant reduction of CLICs in IRSp53 − / − MEFs when compared with WT MEFs , while the number of clathrin and caveolae - derived structures was relatively unaffected . Similar to Supplementary Fig . 1e , f , the CLICs were reduced signi ﬁ cantly upon LG186 treatment in WT MEFs as well ( Fig . 3d and Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . This led us to hypothesise that CG cargo would traf ﬁ c via CME in the absence of IRSp53 . Therefore , we looked at the traf ﬁ cking of GPI - AP ( GFP - GPI ) , ﬂ uid phase and TfR ( CME ) in the absence of IRSp53 at high resolution . We ﬁ rst counted the number of GFP - GPI and ﬂ uid endosomes , and found them to be signi ﬁ cantly lower in IRSp53 − / − MEFs relative to IRSp53WT MEFs ( Fig . 4a ) . Conversely , TfR endosomal number was unaffected ( Fig . 4a ) . We next , looked at co - localisation of GPI - AP / ﬂ uid phase with TfR .

Thus , removal of IRSp53 speci ﬁ cally affected ﬂ uid phase and GPI - AP endocytosis , while CME remained unaffected . Moreover , in cells lacking IRSp53 , GPI - AP and the residual ﬂ uid phase is endocytosed via CME . We next analysed the contribution of different domains of IRSp53 on CG endocytosis by re - introducing into IRSp53 − / − MEFs , GFP - tagged IRSp53WT and a number of mutants of IRSp53 speci ﬁ cally defective in various domains ( Fig . 4d , schematic ) . We found that GFP - IRSp53WT and GFP - IRSp53V522G rescued endocytosis while the rest of the mutants failed to do so ( Fig . 4d ) . In conclusion , these results indicated that IRSp53 is an essential and speci ﬁ c regulator of CG endocytosis that requires functional I - BAR , CRIB and SH3 domains . IRSp53 is recruited to forming CG endocytic vesicles . The complete absence of CG endocytosis in IRSp53 − / − led us to hypothesise that IRSp53 has a direct role to play in CG vesicle formation . Hence , we used pH pulsing assay and examined the recruitment of mCherry - IRSp53 to the forming SecGFP - GPI endocytic sites . A majority of ( > 60 % ) endocytic events exhibited prominent recruitment of IRSp53 ( Fig . 5a , Supplementary Fig . 6c and Table 1 ) . Since the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 has been shown to sense / induce negative curvature in a membrane tension and protein concentration - dependent manner 48 , we looked at changes in its spatial distribution during the formation of endocytic vesicle using two types of masks — a spot and a ring mask ( Fig . 5a , schematic ) . Unlike the intensity pro ﬁ les of CDC42 that did not exhibit any differential temporal patterns of recruitment between the two types of masks ( Fig . 5b , black vs . red trace ) , IRSp53 displayed a biphasic recruitment pattern ( Fig . 5a ) . In phase I ( − 36 to − 15 s ) , IRSp53 was ﬁ rst recruited over a large area indicated by an increase in intensity in both spot and ring traces . Subsequently , in phase II ( − 15 to 0 s ) , IRSp53 was con ﬁ ned at the centre indicated by a concerted decrease in the ring mask intensity and increase in the spot mask intensity trace ( Fig . 5a , black vs . red trace ) . The increase of IRSp53 was more prominent in phase II toward the centre ( Fig . 5a , black vs . purple trace ) and correlated with the recruitment of CDC42 ( r = 0 . 6 ; Table 2 ) . To visualise the recruitment of GFP - IRSp53 at high spatial resolution , we co - expressed a GBP - APEX reagent ( GFP - binding protein soybean ascorbate peroxidase ) and processed for EM as described previously 49 ( Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig . 4c and Supplementary Movies 3 – 4 ) . GBP - APEX binds to GFP and converts 3 , 3 ′ - diamino - benzamidine into an osmiophilic polymer in the presence of H 2 O 2 49 . Images of 3D rendering from the electron densities revealed that IRSp53 associated with tubular structures characteristic of CLICs as described previously 23 and as expected , with ﬁ lopodial structures 38 ( Fig . 5c , see Methods ) . In the 2D sections , IRSp53 was observed to accumulate as discrete patches at the plasma membrane ( PM ) ( Supplementary Fig . 4c i – ii , arrowheads ) and was frequently associated with tubulovesi - cular invaginations or tubular structures close to PM and ﬁ lopodial tips ( Supplementary Fig . 4c iii , double arrowheads ) . We further validated recruitment of GFP - IRSp53 with an alternate technique , protein - retention expansion microscopy ( ProExM ) 50 , a derivative of expansion microscopy 51 . Expansion microscopy enables imaging of diffraction - limited structures by physically separating them using a swellable polymer cross - linked with the cell . This allows multi - colour super - resolution imaging of a sample with conventional regents and microscope . Thus , structures of around 250 nm will be scaled to 1 μ m in a 4× expanded sample ( see Methods ) , providing a potential apparent resolution of around 70 nm 51 with conventional imaging technology . We stained IRSp53 − / − GFP - IRSp53 MEFs for CD44 and IRSp53 , processed the cells ( Methods and ref . 50 ) , and imaged the samples using ×100 objective in spinning disk microscope [ Supplementary Fig . 4e ( 1a – b ) and Supplementary Movie 5 ) ] . In accordance with our EM images , we observed enrichment of IRSp53 at the tips of the ﬁ lopodia [ Supplementary Fig . 4e ( 2a – c ) and Supplementary Movie 5 ] . Additionally , we could identify several invaginations of CD44 [ Supplementary Fig . 4e ( 3 – 8 , see arrowheads ) and Supplementary Movie 5 ] and found enrichment of IRSp53 . As the neck constriction is expected to develop [ Supplementary Fig . 4e ( 3 – 4 and 6 , arrowheads ) and Supplementary Movie 5 ] , we could see progressive enrichment of IRSp53 around the region of the constriction , relative to other regions of the invagination . The pH pulsing trace showed a speci ﬁ c pattern of enrichment of IRSp53 over time . This is consistent with two scenarios : ( 1 ) that IRSp53 enrichment occurs speci ﬁ cally at the neck which constricts over time and , ( 2 ) that IRSp53 coats the entire tubule with higher enrichment around the necks which in turn constricts over time . Our interpretation of EM and proExM data support the latter scenario . Thus , the complete loss of CG endocytosis in IRSp53 null cells , and localisation of IRSp53 to forming CG endocytic vesicles suggests a role of IRSp53 in the vesicle scission . Branched actin nucleation is required for CG endocytosis . A functional CG endocytic pathway requires dynamic actin since inhibition of actin polymerisation ( Latrunculin A ) , or ﬁ lament stabilisation ( Jasplakinolide ) , inhibited CG endocytosis 13 . CDC42 and IRSp53 are core components of a signalling axis that indir - ectly controls the location and activity of the ARP2 / 3 actin nucleation complex 39 , 52 , 53 . More pertinent , CK666 54 - mediated inhibition of ARP2 / 3 complex , impaired both ﬂ uid - phase and TfR uptake in a dose - dependent manner . However , the extent of Fig . 4 CG pathway is abolished in the absence of IRSp53 . a The box plot shows the number of endosomes per cells ( left ) for endocytosed GFP - GPI ( α - GFP Fab ) , ﬂ uid phase and TfR in IRSp53 − / − and IRSp53 WT cells when pulsed for 2 min along with representative images ( right ) .

By contrast SMIFH2 55 - mediated inhibition of formins , failed to inhibit CG endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . We next explored the spatio - temporal dynamics of F - actin and ARP2 / 3 complex using pRuby - lifeact 56 and mCherry - ARP3 , respectively , during the formation of the endocytic vesicle . ARP3 recruitment ( Fig . 6b , Supplementary Fig . 6d and Table 1 ) began earlier than − 35 s and peaked at − 6 s . This was unexpected since CDC42 , a key regulator of ARP2 / 3 57 was not recruited until − 9 s . Instead , the ARP3 pro ﬁ le was correlated with IRSp53 between − 9 s and + 9 s ( r = 0 . 8 ; Table 2 ) . This indicated that , at least initially , the ARP2 / 3 complex might be recruited in a CDC42 - independent manner . On the other hand , F - actin accumulation began around − 9 s and continued even after the scission event ( Fig . 6c , Supplementary Fig . 6e and Table 1 ) , highly correlated to the CDC42 pro ﬁ le ( r = 0 . 6 ; Table 2 ) .

These observations suggested that ARP2 / 3 complex might be ﬁ rst recruited in an inactive state , and then activated following the arrival of CDC42 . ARP2 / 3 is inhibited by PICK1 at nascent CG endocytic sites . To address how ARP2 / 3 complex was perhaps maintained at the forming endocytic pit in an inactive state , we analysed the role of PICK1 , another ‘ hit ’ in the screen ( Fig . 2 ) . PICK1 , a highly con - served protein , possesses PDZ and BAR domain ( Fig . 7a ) that by intra - molecular interaction , maintains PICK1 in an auto - inhibited state . This auto - inhibited state is further stabilised upon GTP – ARF1 binding to the PDZ domain 58 . Additionally , activated PICK1 negatively regulates ARP2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisa - tion 58 – 60 . The ability of PICK1 to inhibit ARP2 / 3 complex is suppressed by GTP – ARF1 58 . To con ﬁ rm a role of PICK1 in CG endocytosis in mammalian cells , we utilised a speci ﬁ c small - molecule inhibitor of PICK1 , FSC231 61 . CG endocytosis ( ﬂ uid phase ) was inhibited in a dose - dependent fashion ( Fig . 7b ) by this inhibitor . Additionally , in stable PICK1 knockdown lines , ﬂ uid phase and folate receptor ( FR - GPI , another GPI - AP ) endosomal number were lower than that measured in scrambled shRNA stable lines , while TfR endocytosis remained unaffected ( Fig . 7c , d ) . Predictably , GFP - ARF1 and TagRFP - PICK1 co - localised in punctate spots at the TIRF plane in accordance with previous reports 58 ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) . To test the effect of ARF1 activity on PICK1 recruitment we co - expressed TagRFP - PICK1 with either ARF1 - WT or dominant - negative ( ARF1 - DN ; T31N ) and active mutant ( ARF1 - DA ; Q71L ) and tracked the number and dynamics of PICK1 spots using TIRF microscopy ( see Methods ) . The residence time of PICK1 increased signi ﬁ cantly in the presence of ARF1 - DN while it was reduced in the presence of ARF1 - DA ( Fig . 7e ) . ARF1 - DN and DA have been shown to decrease and increase endocytosis , respectively 14 . Thus , the local presence of ARF1 - GTP resulted in the removal of PICK1 from the membrane . Thus , we hypothesised that PICK1 was recruited to forming CG endosome at the early stage , rendering ARP2 / 3 inactive . To explore this possibility , we utilised the pH pulsing assay to visualise PICK1 at the CG endocytic site . We found that TagRFP - PICK1 was recruited to the forming CG endocytic sites ( Fig . 7f , Supplementary Fig . 6f and Table 1 ) in a pulsatile fashion . Maximum enrichment occurred at − 12 s , with an eventual loss corresponding to the time of the rapid rise in ARF1 recruitment around − 9 s ( Fig . 1e , r = 0 . 6 , Table 2 ) . Thus , the pH pulsing assay has led to the realisation that in CG endocytosis , the interplay of two BDPs , PICK1 and IRSp53 , regulate ARP2 / 3 complex . These BDPs interact with the ARP2 / 3 complex ( Supplementary Fig . 5b , upper panel and Supplementary Fig . 4d ) regulate its activity at the forming CG endocytic sites , in opposing fashion under the in ﬂ uence of ARF1 and CDC42 . Discussion CG endocytosis was initially discovered as a route for the entry of toxins 62 , ﬂ uid phase and GPI - anchored proteins when CME was perturbed 11 , 12 , 63 , raising some concerns regarding its physiological role in unperturbed cells 18 . Using a pH pulsing assay we show , here , that a majority of SecGFP - GPI - containing endocytic vesicles form due to a stereotypical and temporally orchestrated recruit - ment of the key molecular machinery namely , CDC42 , ARF1 and GBF1 , which , in turn , mediate the coordinated assembly of speci ﬁ c BAR - containing , membrane deforming and actin regulatory pro - teins , IRSp53 and PICK1 . Notably , however , the vast majority of the endocytic vesicles are devoid of clathrin and dynamin . Thus , a dedicated complex protein machinery drives CG internalisation , similarly to that being observed in CME . The ability of the pH pulsing assay to provide a temporal pro ﬁ le for the recruitment dynamics of the molecular players has considerably extended our understanding of CG endocytic vesicle formation . The GBF1 / ARF1 pair is the earliest module to be assembled and judging by their recruitment pro ﬁ les , it takes around 1 min to assemble the molecular machinery for CG endocytosis . How this pair is concentrated at a forming CG endocytic site is an open question . The CG machinery includes CDC42 , ARP2 / 3 and F - actin along with BDPs , PICK1 and IRSp53 , and in the model ( Fig . 8 ) we propose a biphasic mechanism correlated with the ARF1 recruitment kinetics . In the ﬁ rst phase , the accumula - tion is slow , accompanied by the presence of PICK1 and absence of CDC42 . In the second phase , beginning around − 9 s ( before scission ) , the accumulation of ARF1 speeds up concomitant with the arrival of CDC42 and loss of PICK1 . How the kinetics of ARF1 recruitment is regulated is unclear since its GAP ( GTPase - activating protein ) is presently unknown , as is the GEF for CDC42 . Nevertheless , the presence of PICK1 provides an expla - nation behind ARP2 / 3 recruitment in an inactive state to the forming CG endocytic vesicles long before CDC42 . ARP2 / 3 is then induced to promote actin branching only upon the arrival of IRSp53 and CDC42 . The role of ARP2 / 3 in CG endocytosis is reminiscent of the endocytic process occurring in the budding yeast . In this system , the endocytic machinery strictly depends on Las17 , the yeast homologue of N - WASP but not so much on clathrin and dynamin 64 , 65 . There are however important differences . In CG endocytosis , the ARP2 / 3 complex appears to be activated inde - pendent of its canonical NPF , N - WASP , a CDC42 effector 57 . First , not only did N - WASP fail to recruit to forming CG endocytic sites ( Fig . 6d and Supplementary Fig . 6g ) , over - expression its dominant - negative mutants also failed to inhibit CG endocytosis ( Fig . 6e ) . By contrast , in CME , both ARP2 / 3 complex and N - WASP are recruited to budding CME vesicles , and in ﬂ uence endocytosis in some cell types 28 .

PICK1 operates in the early phases , and may func - tion as an inhibitor of ARP2 / 3 , consistent with the modest recruitment of F - actin in the presence of PICK1 observed here and as reported previously 59 , 60 . PICK1 recruitment occurs via its BAR domain since when mutated and overexpressed , it acts as a dominant negative for CG endocytosis ( Supplementary Fig . 5c ) . PICK1 recruitment is not only rapid , but also transient . We ﬁ nd that the localisation of PICK1 to the membrane was negatively correlated to the activity of ARF1 , similar to that observed in neuronal cells 58 , wherein GTP – ARF1 interaction with PICK1 rendered PICK1 incapable of inhibiting ARP2 / 3 complex . This is followed by the second phase characterised by the simultaneous recruitment of CDC42 / IRSp53 effector complex enabling the activation of ARP2 / 3 and subsequent polymerisation of actin at the site of endocytosis . However , the NPF linking IRSp53 and ARP2 / 3 activation is not yet characterised and is the subject of investigation . There is no single unifying theme for vesicle scission in CIE and multiple modules may co - exist . Recently , endophilin A has been shown to facilitate tubule scission by a combination of scaffolding , dynamin recruitment and dynein - mediated elonga - tion of membrane tubules leading to an increase in friction 66 . In the CG pathway , IRSp53 emerges as a major player .

A minimal model accounting for all these activities suggests that IRSp53 might be enriched at the vesicle neck , where it would regulate the actin machinery necessary to trigger CG vesicle scission . The spatio - temporal dynamics and ultrastructure analysis of IRSp53 recruitment at CG sites are consistent with such a model . However , the data does not permit an unequivocal picture ; better resolution and reagents are necessary to verify this speculation . Lastly , the complete and speci ﬁ c loss of CG endocytosis ( but not CME ) in the absence of IRSp53 makes the requirement for IRSp53 necessary for CG endocytic process . In summary , we propose that CG endocytic vesicle formation begins with GBF1 / ARF1 concentrating at sites of endocytic pits . Following this , though ARP2 / 3 is recruited , it is held in an inactive state by PICK1 ( Fig . 8a ) . Meanwhile , IRSp53 is recruited ( potentially via its I - BAR domain ) and activated by CDC42 leading to ARP2 / 3 activation via unknown effector ( s ) ( Fig . 8b ) . The loss of IRSp53 and ARP2 / 3 from the membrane as the endocytic vesicle is pinched is consistent with their role in endosomal neck dynamics , providing a new candidate for mole - cular machinery of the pinching process in the absence of dynamin . It is conceivable that the IRSp53 provides a scaffold for a friction - based scission mechanism as recently suggested 66 , with actin polymerisation providing driving force for tubule elonga - tion . Alternatively , this force could arise from the involvement of a microtubule - based machinery as recently advocated in the internalisation of cholera toxin 67 . The assays developed here and the identi ﬁ cation of a number of molecular players and their temporal recruitment pro ﬁ le provides a path towards under - standing a molecular mechanism for the formation of a CG endocytic vesicle . Methods Cell culture , reagents , and plasmids . See Supplementary Information . pH pulsing assay . pH pulsing assay was adapted for Nikon TE 2000 TIRF microscope ( for the details of the microscope , see microscope section in S . I . ) from a similar assay as described previously 4 . Brie ﬂ y , FR - AGS cells were plated on custom - designed coverslip bottom dishes and were transfected with SecGFP - GPI and X - FP constructs 12 – 14 h before the assay . The dishes were then ﬁ tted with a custom - designed holder to place inlet and outlet tubing . Tubing from a pH 7 . 4 ( HEPES ) and pH 5 . 5 ( MES ) buffers kept in a water bath at 38 °C went through a peristaltic ﬂ ow controller ( Bioscience Tools ) into the cell chamber . The tempera - ture of the cells in the dish was maintained at 30°C by maintaining the buffers , the objective and the microscope ( using a chamber ) at appropriately high tempera - tures . Imaging at 30 °C slows the endocytic process to match the time resolution achieved by the ﬂ ow setup ( 3 s ) . Images were captured using a script written in open source imaging software , Micromanager , to control the time of ﬂ ow and imaging . Typically , buffers are exchanged every 3 s and three images are collected sequentially before the end of 3s in two channels , GFP and RFP , using camera exposure of 100ms . The chamber around the microscope was built with the help of NCBS Mechanical Workshop , AC department and Dr Manoj Matthew ( NCBS - CIFF ) . Endocytic assay . Mammalian endocytic assays : All population - based endocytic assays were performed as described 14 . For endocytic assays in mammalian cells , 2 - day plated cells on poly - D - Lysine - coated dishes were used . The assays were performed in the water bath maintained at 37°C . The media was removed and replaced with media containing ﬂ uorescently labelled probes at appropriate dilu - tions for the required time ( TMR - Dextran was used at 1 mg / ml , α - GFP was used at 20 µg / ml , Cy3 - Mov18 was used at 5µg / ml and Tf was used at 10µg / ml ) . The cells were then transferred to ice and washed with ice - cold medium 1 buffer ( 140mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES , 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) . The cells were then stripped for surface - bound Tf with ascorbate buffer ( 160mM sodium ascorbate , 40 mM ascorbic acid , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM CaCl 2 , pH 4 . 5 ) . In the case of GPI - AP ( GFP - GPI and FR - GPI ) uptake , the surface was removed using PI - PLC which cleaves GPI anchor 14 . Cells were treated with PI - PLC ( 50 µg / ml ) for 1h on ice . The cells were ﬁ xed with 2 . 5 % paraformaldehyde and stained for surface TfR . BAR domain screen : RNAi screen for BDPs in Drosophila genome was done on S2R + cells stably expressing TfR 15 . Brie ﬂ y , the cells were plated in a 12 - well plate ( 0 . 5 million cells / well ) for 1h . The media was then replaced with 600 µl of serum - free media supplemented with appropriate dsRNA at ( ﬁ nal amount , 10 µg ) for 1h , post which 600 µl of serum containing media was added . After 4 days of depletion , the cells were assayed for endocytosis . On the 4th day , cells were deadhered from the well by manual pipetting and plated on coverslip bottom dishes . Cells were pulsed with TMR - dextran diluted in serum containing media for 5min . The cells were subsequently transferred to ice and washed with ice - cold medium 1 buffer ( supplemented with 1mg / ml BSA and glucose ) . The cells were then ﬁ xed using 2 % paraformaldehyde ( 5 min on ice and 15 min at room temperature ) . dsRNA was prepared from the Drosophila Open Biosystems library v1 15 . HRP uptake and electron microscopy : WT and IRSp53 − / − MEFs were serum starved for 45min in the presence or absence of 10 μ M LG186 compound . Cells were treated for 2 or 5 min at 37 °C with 10mg / ml HRP in serum - free medium , rapidly washed with complete medium on ice and subsequently ﬁ xed with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in PBS . Peroxidase development and further processing were performed as described previously 23 . Cells were sectioned parallel to the substratum and viewed unstained on a Jeol 1011 ( Tokyo , Japan ) transmission electron microscope equipped with a Morada Soft Imaging camera ( Olympus ) at two - fold binning . Quantitation was performed as follows : for 5 - min HRP uptake , images were captured at random across the monolayer by moving a de ﬁ ned distance across the grid to avoid user bias . For 2 - min uptake , whole cells positive for HRP were imaged and montaged to generate a high - resolution image encompassing the entire cell . Five cells were imaged and montaged for each replicate . HRP - labelled elements per image or per cell pro ﬁ le were classi ﬁ ed using the following criteria ; vesicular elements including clathrin - coated vesicles and caveolae — circular pro ﬁ les < 200nm in diameter ; early endosomes – circular and ring - shaped pro ﬁ les , including multivesicular structures > 200nm in diameter ; CLIC / GEEC – other pro ﬁ les including tubules and small ring - shaped structures < 200 nm in diameter . Ultrastructural localisation of IRSp53 . Thin sections : Localisation of GFP - tagged IRSp53 was performed as described previously 49 . Cells ( FR - AGS ) were seeded onto 30 mm tissue culture dishes ( TRP ) and transfected 24 h later using Lipofectamine Fig . 7 PICK1 is involved in CG endocytosis and is negatively regulated by ARF1 . a Schematic depicts domain organisation of PICK1 . b Histograms ( top ) show quanti ﬁ cation of ﬂ uid - phase and TfR uptake in AGS cells treated with DMSO alone ( 0 µ M ) or the indicated concentrations of PICK1 inhibitor , FSC231 , normalised to DMSO - treated controls , along with its representative images ( below ) .

Endocytic distribution at each time point was compared to the random distribution by Mann – Whitney U test and the log 10 ( p ) [ log 10 ( 0 . 05 ) is − 1 . 3 and log 10 ( 0 . 001 ) is − 2 . 5 ] is plotted below .

Cells were subsequently processed for electron microscopy 24 h after transfection . Brie ﬂ y , AGS cells were double transfected with GFP - tagged IRSp53 and an expression vector encoding for a GFP - binding peptide conjugated to APEX2 ( Addgene plasmid # 67651 ) . Cells were washed in PBS , ﬁ xed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buffer and subjected to the 3 , 3 ′ - diaminobenzidine ( DAB ; Sigma - Aldrich ) reaction in the presence of H 2 O 2 for 30 min . DAB reaction product was contrasted by 1 % osmium tetroxide for 2min . Cells were processed in situ and embedded in LX112 resin before sectioning parallel to the culture dish . Tomogram : Thick plastic sections ( 200nm ) were cut on an ultramicrotome ( UC6 , Leica ) and collected onto formvar - coated copper slot grids and lightly carbon coated . Dual - axis tilt series were acquired on a 120 kV TECNAI 12 ( FEI ) transmission electron microscope ﬁ tted with a LC - 1100 4k x 4k lens coupled CCD camera ( Direct Electron ) and a tilt rotate holder ( Fischione ) utilising a tilt range of − 60 to + 60° . Microscope control and image acquisition was accomplished using the software SerialEM 68 . Tilt series were later reconstructed using weighted back projection and ﬁ ducial markers ( 10 nm ) into a single volume with IMOD 69 . To examine areas with the greatest electron density in an unbiased manner , density - based thresholding was employed with the Isosurface render programme in IMOD as previously described 49 for APEX / DAB reaction product . The whole PM of the tomographic volume was rendered and tubular regions of interest were highlighted at greater magni ﬁ cation . Protein - retention expansion microscopy . The ProExM protocol was adapted from previous reports 50 , 51 . IRSp53 − / − GFP - IRSp53 addback cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days . The cells were ﬁ xed using 4 % PFA for 15min at room temperature ( RT ) . The surface CD44 was stained using α - CD44 ( Rat ) following which the cells were permeablised using 0 . 05 % Tween20 for 15min . IRSp53 was dual stained using α - GFP and IRSp53 antibodies both of which were generated in Rabbit . Following this , secondary antibodies against Rat ( Alexa - 568 ) and Rabbit ( Alexa - 488 ) were used . The cells then were treated with Acryloyl X - SE ( 10 mg / ml stock solution in DMSO , used 1 : 100 diluted in PBS ) for 12h at RT . The cells were washed with PBS 2× 15 min each before proceeding to gelation . For a 10 ml of monomer solution ( sod . acrylate ( ﬁ nal concentration 8 . 6g / 100 ml ) , acrylamide ( ﬁ nal concentration 2 . 5g / 100 ml ) , N , N ′ - methylenebisacrylamide ( ﬁ nal concentra - tion 0 . 15 g / 100ml ) , NaCl ( ﬁ nal concentration 11 . 7 g / 100ml ) were diluted in 1× PBS . Monomer solution ( 48 µl ) was mixed with water ( 1 µl ) , TEMED ( 1 µl ) and APS ( 10 % , 1µl ) was added on to the cells . The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min . The gel was incubated in the digestion buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 8M guanidine HCl , Proteinase K ( 1 : 100 , ﬁ nal con - centration 8 units / ml , added before use ) for 6h at 37 °C . The gel was washed with double distilled water for 3 – 5 times for 15min to achieve full 4× expansion . The gel was placed on a coverslip and was imaged using ×100 spinning disk microscope . Image analysis . In all cases , images were analysed with ImageJ and / or custom software written in MATLAB ( The Mathworks , Natick , Massachusetts , USA ) . The number of cells and repeats of the experiments are mentioned in the legends and ﬁ gures . Statistical signi ﬁ cance ( p ) was calculated by Mann – Whitney U test and two - sample Student ’ s t test , as reported in the legends . pH pulsing assay analysis : A semi - automated analysis was developed in MATLAB to identify newly formed endocytic vesicles in the pH pulsing assay and trace their intensity over time in pH 7 , pH 5 and RFP channels .

See S . I . for further details . Endocytic assay analysis : In all cases , images were analysed with ImageJ and custom software written in MATLAB ( The Mathworks , Natick , Massachusetts , USA ) . Each endocytic assay was performed with two technical duplicates . The number of repeats for each experiment is mentioned in its ﬁ gure legend . For a given experiment , weighted mean for the technical duplicates was calculated as mentioned previously 14 . The total number of cells taken for analysis is mentioned in the legends and ﬁ gures ( at least 40 – 50 cells were taken from each technical duplicates ) . Subsequently , the cell - wise endocytosis distribution was normalised by weighted means of the control . This allowed data to be pooled from different days to be depicted as average and standard deviation as error bars . The statistical signi ﬁ cance was calculated by Mann – Whitney U test . * represent p value < 0 . 05 . Co - localisation analysis : The analysis was performed by two methods . JaCoP ( Just another co - loc plugin ) . An ImageJ plugin which has multiple options by which co - localisation between two molecules can be measured 70 . The object - based overlap or Van Steensel cross - correlation function options were used . Brie ﬂ y , images were thresholded manually and were given appropriate parameters for either of the two options . Spotter33 . It is a custom MATLAB script ( in - house ) as described previously 11 . The algorithm consists of applying a top - hat ﬁ lter on the images , following which the structures are segmented . The threshold is manually determined for each channel . The segmented structures are then trimmed ( user determined ) until their are shape and size matched to the original structures . In a channel , each segmented particle mask ’ s centroid and pixel list is recorded , and the presence of a particle in that location is checked in the other channel . The number of pixels overlapped is normalied to the particle area . This value is averaged across all the particles for a given cell and reported . Residence time analysis : FR - AGS cells expressing the desired molecule tagged with a ﬂ uorescent protein was imaged for the appropriate time 37 °C in TIRF . TagRFPt - PICK1 was imaged for 100 frames with 200 ms exposure and 500 ms interval and Nyquist criteria was satis ﬁ ed . Spots were segmented and tracked using µ - track 71 . The residence time of TagRFPt - PICK1 spots per cell was calculated from the output of µ - track by custom MATLAB script . Brie ﬂ y , the frame in which the spot was detected and the last frame a given spot of tracked is recorded . Spots that appeared in the ﬁ rst and the last frame of the movie are discarded . Additionally , spots which appeared for only 1 frame are also discarded . The spots whose track end was the last frame was discared as well as the track may or may not have continued .
