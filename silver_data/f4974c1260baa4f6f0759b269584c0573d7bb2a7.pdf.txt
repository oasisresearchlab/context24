Abstract The latest meta - analysis of genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) identified 90 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) across 78 genomic regions associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) , yet the mechanisms by which these variants influence the development of the disease remains largely elusive . To establish the functional gene regulatory networks associated with PD - SNPs , we utilised an approach combining spatial ( chromosomal conformation capture ) and functional ( expression quantitative trait loci ; eQTL ) data . We identified 518 genes subject to regulation by 76 PD - SNPs across 49 tissues , that encompass 36 peripheral and 13 CNS tissues . Notably , one third of these genes were regulated via tran s - acting mechanisms ( distal ; risk locus - gene separated by > 1Mb , or on different chromosomes ) . Of particular interest is the identification of a novel trans - eQTL - gene connection between rs10847864 and SYNJ1 in the adult brain cortex , highlighting a convergence between familial studies and PD GWAS loci for SYNJ1 ( PARK20 ) for the first time . Furthermore , we identified 16 neuro - development specific eQTL - gene regulatory connections within the foetal cortex , consistent with hypotheses suggesting a neurodevelopmental involvement in the pathogenesis of PD . Through utilising Louvain clustering we extracted nine significant and highly intra - connected clusters within the entire gene regulatory network . The nine clusters are enriched for specific biological processes and pathways , some of which have not previously been associated with PD . Together , our results not only contribute to an overall understanding of the mechanisms and impact of specific combinations of PD - SNPs , but also highlight the potential impact gene regulatory networks may have when elucidating aetiological subtypes of PD . Introduction Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) is considered to be primarily an idiopathic neurodegenerative disorder , with monogenic forms contributing to just 5 - 10 % of all cases 1 . However , the idiopathic nature of PD is being questioned , as evidence increasingly supports a complex involvement of genetics in the development of the majority of cases 2 , 3 . Genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified > 200 PD risk loci 4 , with 90 PD - associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( PD - SNPs ) across 78 risk loci reported in the largest meta - analysis to date 5 . As is typically observed with GWAS variants , the majority of the PD - SNPs are located within non - coding regions of the genome , with no direct or obvious influence on protein structure or function 6 , 7 . Studies have shown that such non - coding disease - associated variants are more likely to be located within regulatory regions 8 , and thus contribute to risk through influencing gene regulation and expression , either locally or distally . These regulatory interactions are likely to be tissue specific , adding a further layer of complexity . Consequently , determining how these variants contribute to PD risk , both individually and in combination , poses a major scientific challenge 9 , 10 . Although PD is defined as a neurodegenerative disease , mounting evidence demonstrates the role of non - central nervous system ( CNS ) tissues in the development and presentation of such disorders ( i . e . Huntington’s 11 and PD 12 , 13 ) . Both alpha - synuclein ( αSyn ) protein pathology and modulation of PD - related genes have been identified in peripheral tissues ( e . g . the gastrointestinal tract and heart ) of PD patients 12 , 14 – 19 . The contribution of peripheral tissue in the origins of PD warrants further research , and thus the consideration of how PD - SNPs mediate risk should not be confined to tissues of the CNS . Spatial gene regulatory interactions are hypothesized to be drivers of complex trait heritability 20 , acting through both cis - ( nearby ) and trans - ( distal ; locus - gene separated by > 1Mb , or on different chromosomes ) mechanisms ( Figure 1 ) 19 , 21 , 22 . These cis - and trans - acting elements can regulate the transcription of one or more genes , in a tissue specific manner , and are commonly detected in the form of expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTL ) 23 . Genetic variation within elements of gene regulatory networks likely confer risk at different developmental stages , including during foetal neurodevelopment – a critical stage that has a growing body of support in neurodegenerative diseases 24 . Here we performed correlational analyses of experimentally derived data to identify eQTLs that physically connect PD - SNPs to the genes that they control , in three - dimensions , with the goal of understanding the putative functional impacts of known PD - SNPs 21 . The integration of spatial and eQTL data allows for the identification of trans - eQTL - gene associations 25 , thereby nominating genes which have not previously been implicated in PD . Our analysis identified 518 genes subject to regulation by 76 PD - SNPs across 49 tissues . Further , clustering analysis of the entire gene network revealed nine significant , intra - connected clusters , enriched for both novel and known PD biological pathways , highlighting putative disease - causative molecular mechanisms and areas for future research . Methods Data and reference files The 90 PD - SNPs ( across 78 genomic regions ; Supplementary table 1 ) investigated in this study were previously identified by a GWAS meta - analysis as being of genome wide significance ( p < 5x10 - 8 ) 5 . The human genome reference sequence used in this study was GRCh38 ( hg38 ) . Identification of eQTL - gene pairs The contextualise developmental SNPs using 3D information ( CoDeS3D ) 21 algorithm was used to identify genes whose transcript levels are putatively regulated by the 90 PD - SNPs . CoDeS3D integrates data on spatial interactions between genomic loci ( Hi - C data ; Supplementary table 2 ) with expression data ( genotype - tissue expression database version 8 ; GTEx v8 26 ) to identify genes whose transcript levels are associated with a physical connection to the SNP ( i . e . spatial eQTL ) . Hi - C captures regions of the genome that are physically interacting , and can be covalently connected by a cross - linking agent 27 . The hg38 reference genome was digitally digested with MboI , DpnII and HindIII to obtain all possible Hi - C fragment locations for the 90 PD - SNP loci . All identified SNP fragments ( tagged by the PD - SNPs ) were then queried against the Hi - C databases ( 70 different cell lines from 12 studies ; Supplementary table 2 ) to identify distal fragments of DNA that spatially connect to the SNP loci . Spatial SNP - gene connections are established when the SNP - containing fragment spatially connects to a fragment that overlaps any region between the start and end of a gene as defined by GENCODE . There was no binning or padding around restriction fragments to obtain gene overlap . The resulting spatial SNP - gene pairs were subsequently used to query the GTEx v8 eQTL database 26 to identify spatial SNP - gene pairs with significant eQTLs ( both cis - and trans - acting eQTL ; false discovery rate ( FDR ) adjusted p < 0 . 05 ) . We performed a ‘brain specific’ analysis by interrogating only the subset of Hi - C libraries derived from brain - specific cell lines ( 11 cell lines from 4 studies , highlighted in red in Supplementary table 2 ) 28 – 31 and only expression data from the 13 brain - specific tissues in GTEx v8 . Identification of neurodevelopmental - specific eQTL - gene pairs We performed a neurodevelopmental stage specific analysis by interrogating Hi - C libraries from foetal - specific brain cell lines ( cortical plate neurons ; germinal zone neurons ; Supplementary table 2 ; datasets no . 1 and 2 ) with expression data from a foetal cortex eQTL dataset 32 . Functional analysis of eQTL SNPs SNPnexus v4 33 ( https : / / www . snp - nexus . org / v4 / ; accessed 22 / 06 / 2020 ) was used to obtain known epigenomic annotations for the eQTL SNPs . Probability of gene loss of function intolerance The LOEUF ( loss - of - function observed / expected upper bound fraction ) 34 score for the genes , within the significant SNP - gene pairs , was obtained from gnomAD v2 . 1 . 1 35 ( https : / / gnomad . broadinstitute . org / ; accessed 21 / 07 / 2020 ) to determine the level of constraint on the identified genes . Protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) and Modularity clustering STRING 36 ( Search Tool for Retrieval of Interaction Genes / proteins ; https : / / string - db . org , accessed 22 / 07 / 2020 ) was queried to identify published information on interactions between genes , or their respective proteins . Only PPIs with a high confidence level ( > 0 . 700 , as defined in STRING ) were used for this analysis . A Louvain method was used to determine the syntality of each node , following four different criteria : 1 ) immediate connection ; 2 ) shortest path ( i . e . the minimum number of edges connecting any two nodes ) ; 3 ) node acting as a bridge ; 4 ) connections that nodes have in common . The proteins were then hierarchically clustered using the Louvain algorithm 37 , clusters were defined as significant if p < 0 . 05 . Pathway analyses & literature search The g : Profiler 38 database was used to identify enriched pathways . Queries were run on : 1 ) all genes’ 2 ) the ‘ cis ’ ; and 3 ) the ‘ trans ’ subsets of genes ( i . e . genes regulated only in cis , or only in trans ) . PubMed was used to search ( using “ [ gene name ] ” and Parkinson’s” ) the published literature for all identified genes and known PD associations . Additional analyses of genes and variants identified by Makarious et al Makarious et al recently utilised a multi - modality approach to identify genetic and transcriptomic features that contribute to risk predictions of PD 39 . They highlighted two SNPs ( rs10835060 and rs4238361 ) , and 29 genes . We performed CoDeS3D analysis on the two SNPs , across all Hi - C cell lines and GTEx tissues ( as previously described ) . The resulting eQTL gene pairs , along with the 29 genes highlighted through transcriptomic analysis , were combined with our set of 523 genes . Louvain clustering and PPI analysis were re - run on this combined list of genes to see how or if the subset of genes co - locate within the networks .

Results PD GWAS SNPs regulate the expression of > 500 genes Nalls et al . 5 identified 90 SNPs that were associated with PD at the level of genome - wide significance ( Supplementary table 1 ) , yet the mechanisms by which these variants influence the development of the disease remains largely elusive . We used the CoDeS3D algorithm 21 to identify SNPs that have evidence of physical interaction with the gene as captured by Hi - C ( Supplementary table 2 ) and also associate with changes in gene expression ( hereafter eQTLs ) and the genes whose transcript levels were affected ( Figure 1 ) . 76 ( 84 % ) of the 90 PD risk SNPs were identified as eQTLs associated with the regulation of 518 genes through 542 unique eQTL - gene pairs , across the 49 tissues ( Table 1 , Supplementary table 3 ) . The 76 eQTLs were individually associated with the regulatory impacts of as few as one , or as many as 39 genes in cis and trans ( Supplementary figure 1 ) . We identified 178 of the 542 genes as being associated with PD through trans - eQTL - gene connections . We did not identify eQTL interactions for 14 of the 90 SNPs . Conversely , 8 of these 14 SNPs are annotated as being eQTLs in the IPDGC GWAS Locus Browser 40 , and a further four are eQTLs in GTEx ( Supplementary table 1 ) . However , in these 12 instances , the eQTLs occur in cis - ( i . e . within 1Mb ) and are not supported by Hi - C data . PD SNPs Brain specific * All tissues * No .

Consistent with observations for SNPs associated with other traits 41 , at least one trans - regulatory interaction was identified for 81 . 6 % ( 62 of 76 ) of the eQTLs . Moreover , 92 . 7 % ( 165 of 178 ) of these trans - eQTL - gene interactions were identified in only one tissue . By contrast , the cis - interactions were identified in eight tissues on average ( range of 1 to 49 tissues ) . 11 . 8 % of the eQTLs ( 9 of 76 ; Supplementary table 1 ) were exclusively involved in trans - regulatory interactions . Trans - eQTL interactions regulated 18 . 1 % of the genes identified in the brain ( 30 out of 166 ; Supplementary table 4 ) , and 32 . 8 % of the genes amongst all 49 tissues ( 178 out of 518 ; Table 2 ; Supplementary table 3 ) . Collectively , these results highlight the importance of looking beyond the nearest gene to identify the regulatory effects of disease - associated variants . Genes subject to cis - or trans - regulation Brain specific * All tissues * Cis eQTL - gene pairs 136 ( 82 . 0 % ) 364 ( 67 . 2 % ) Trans - intrachromosomal eQTL - gene pairs 10 ( 6 . 0 % ) 56 ( 10 . 3 % ) Trans - interchromosomal eQTL - gene pairs 20 ( 12 . 0 % ) 122 ( 22 . 5 % ) Table 2 : Proportion of genes subject to cis - and trans - regulation . The proportion of eQTL - gene pairs that are either cis - , trans - intrachromosomal or trans - interchromosomal in ( a ) 13 GTEx brain - specific tissues and ( b ) all 49 GTEx tissues . Brain - specific indicates the eQTL dataset obtained through analysing Hi - C cell lines only from the brain , and eQTLs only from the brain tissues in GTEx . All - tissues indicates the eQTL dataset obtained through analysing all Hi - C cell lines , and eQTLs from all tissues in GTEx . There is a significant difference ( Chi square test p . value < 0 . 01 ) between brain tissues and all tissues for the proportions of the cis vs . trans eQTLs . We reasoned that SNPs that are involved in eQTLs likely mark enhancer or promoter sites 42 . We queried SNPnexus 33 to identify those eQTLs that were marked by histone modifications or fell within open chromatin regions , as indicated by DNAse accessibility . Consistent with our hypothesis , 91 % ( 69 of 76 ) of the SNPs were marked by histone modifications associated with either enhancers ( 58 ) and / or promoters ( 27 ) . 27 . 6 % of the SNPs were within accessible chromatin ( Supplementary table 5 ) . Collectively , these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the loci marked by these eQTLs may be involved in the regulation of gene expression . Pathway analysis was conducted on the complete set of 518 genes that were impacted by the eQTLs ( Supplementary table 6 ) . g : Profiler 38 identified significant ( adj . p < 0 . 05 ) enrichment within 10 known biological pathways ( g : GOSt ) , including response to interferon - gamma , synaptic vesicle recycling and endocytosis . The regulatory impact of PD - SNPs extends beyond the CNS Although PD is considered a degenerative disease of the brain , it has become apparent that dysfunction and or alpha - synuclein pathology is observed in non - CNS tissues of PD patients 13 – 15 . Our spatial eQTL analysis included an assessment of the tissue distribution of the effects of the identified eQTLs within 13 CNS and 36 peripheral tissues . We identified peripheral tissue - specific eQTLs for 28 % of the PD - SNPs ( 21 of 76 ) . Only 2 of the 76 PD - SNPs ( i . e . rs10756907 – SH3GL2 , brain cortex ; rs873786 – SLC26A1 , brain cerebellum ) had eQTLs that impacted gene expression levels exclusively in the brain . This supports a possible role for peripheral tissues in PD risk ( Supplementary figure 3 ) . The ability to detect eQTLs in specific tissues is known to correlate with tissue sample size within GTEx 43 . Consistent with this , we identified highly significant correlations between tissue sample numbers and a ) all - eQTLs in the brain tissues ( Figure 2a ; identified using brain specific Hi - C and eQTL data ; Supplementary Table 4 ) ; and b ) all tissues ( i . e . the 49 tissues included within GTEx ; Figure 2e ) . These highly significant correlations remained when analysing the cis - eQTL subsets in the brain ( R = 0 . 93 , p = 3 . 6e - 06 ; Figure 2b ) , and all tissues ( R = 0 . 9 , p < 2 . 2e - 16 ; Figure 2f ) . Similarly , the correlation was evident for trans - intrachromosomal eQTLs detected in all tissues ( R = 0 . 67 , p < 1 . 8e - 06 ; Figure 2g ) . By contrast , there was no observable correlation between the number of trans - interchromosomal interactions and tissue sample number ( Figure 2d , h ) . The substantia nigra and brain cerebellar hemisphere exhibited more trans - interchromosomal - eQTLs ( Figure 2d ) , while the thyroid exhibited more eQTLs than expected across all three categories ( Figure 2e - h ) . Genes subject to trans - regulation by PD - SNPs are more likely to be intolerant to loss - of - function mutations Genes that are intolerant to inactivation by loss - of - function variants are deemed essential for healthy development 44 . Intolerance to loss of function variants leaves changes to regulation as one of the few mechanisms that can be modified to introduce variation at a population level . The 117 trans - interchromosomal - eQTL regulated genes were significantly ( p < 0 . 01 , Kruskal - Wallis test ) more intolerant to loss - of - function mutations ( LOEUF 0 . 42 [ median ] ; a low LOEUF score is indicative of evolutionary constraint ) than those regulated by cis - or trans - intrachromosomal acting eQTLs ( LOEUF 0 . 83 and 0 . 85 respectively [ median ] ; Figure 3 ; Supplementary table 7 ) . This result is consistent with earlier observations that trans - eQTLs are enriched in regulating constrained genes with low LOEUF scores 19 . PD GWAS SNPs regulate expression of a subset of genes within the foetal cortex Emerging evidence suggests PD has a neuro - developmental aspect 48 , similar to recent observations in Huntington’s disease 24 . Therefore , we analysed the regulatory impacts of the PD - SNPs using foetal cell line Hi - C ( i . e . cortical plate neurons and germinal zone neurons 29 ) and foetal cortex eQTL datasets 32 ( Supplementary table 8 ) . 33 genes were found to be regulated by 22 PD - SNPs in the foetal cortex . Of these , sixteen genes were regulated by eQTLs involving PD - SNPs in the foetal cortex , without evidence of any eQTLs in adult brain tissues ( Figure 4 ; Supplementary table 4 ) . Ten genes were affected by eQTLs involving PD - SNPs in both the foetal and adult cortex , with effect sizes that were similar in both ( Figure 4 ) . Finally , seven genes were regulated by cis - eQTLs in the foetal cortex and adult non - cortical brain tissues ( Figure 4 ) . These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that development - stage specific eQTL patterns impact on disease - relevant mechanisms and thus may contribute to the proposed temporal phases of PD pathogenesis 47 . Louvain clustering highlights nine intra - connected protein clusters , enriched for disease - relevant , biological pathways Network representations of complex datasets can aid the identification of biological relationships that are often not identified by enrichment analyses 48 . We used a Louvain clustering algorithm to identify clusters of interacting genes and proteins from within a Protein - Protein Interaction Network ( PPIN ) generated from the 523 eQTL regulated genes ( 518 adult tissue eQTLs and the 5 unique foetal cortex eQTLs ; Supplementary table 9 ) . Nine significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) clusters consisting of 122 genes were identified within the high - confidence PPIN ( Figure 5 ) . The genes within each cluster were regulated by between 5 and 18 PD - SNPs ( Supplementary table 9 ) and every cluster contained at least two genes that were co - regulated by a single SNP ( Supplementary figure 4 ) . Notably , genes that were subject to trans - acting eQTLs were central to the definition and identification of several clusters ( Figure 5 ) . Pathway analysis ( g : Profiler ) of the genes within the individual clusters revealed enrichment in categories that included immunological surveillance ( cluster 7 ) , synaptic vesicle recycling ( cluster 5 ) and microtubule polymerisation ( cluster 3 ) ( Supplementary table 10 ) . Makarious et al recently used a multi - modal machine learning approach , incorporating multi - omics datasets , to inform and improve predictions of PD 39 . Beyond the 90 GWAS SNP signals ( which collectively were the top genetic feature ) , they also identified rs10835060 and rs4238361 as two SNPs that impact on PD biology . CoDeS3D analysis identified eQTLs for both rs10835060 ( KRTAP5 - AS1 , CCDC88A , KRTAP5 - 5 , BRSK2 ) and rs4238361 ( USP47 ; and RP11 - 507B12 . 2 and RP11 - 259A24 . 1 ) ( Supplementary table 11 ) . Notably , BRSK2 co - locates with cluster 2 through an established interaction with the Tau encoding MAPT gene 49 . The model also highlighted 29 genes through transcriptomic analysis . Three of these genes ( MMP9 , TRIM4 and SYS1 ) integrate into clusters 1 , 4 and 5 , respectively ( Supplementary figure 5 ) . The co - location of genes and eQTLs , identified as being important for PD diagnosis 39 , within the nine clusters supports the potential importance of the gene - gene interactions and enriched pathways in PD . 402 genes did not segregate in the nine clusters . Of note , 211 of the 402 genes ( 52 . 5 % ) had not previously been associated with PD GWAS loci ( iPDGC PD browser 40 ) . Of the 211 , 123 genes were regulated by trans - eQTL - gene connections . Notably , iPDGC identified five genes ( DNAI1 , EYA4 , LYVE1 , MYO5B , PDZRN4 ) as being regulated by cis - eQTLs yet . These five genes were exclusively identified through trans - eQTL regulatory connections in our analysis . Discussion Assigning functionality to PD - SNPs is a critical step towards determining how they contribute to the risk of PD development . In this study , we identified 518 genes whose expression was regulated in cis or trans by PD - SNPs , and the tissues where this regulation occurs . We also demonstrated that 22 PD - SNPs impact the regulation of a subset of 16 genes solely in the foetal cortex , and a further 10 genes in both the foetal and adult cortex . Of all 523 identified genes , a subset of 122 cis - and trans - regulated genes formed nine clusters within a protein : protein interaction network that were enriched for specific biological pathways , some of which have not been previously associated with PD . Our findings support the hypothesis that both cis - and trans - dysregulation of gene expression contributes to the risk of PD and provide insight into possible disease - causing mechanisms . SYNJ1 encodes synaptojanin - 1 , a presynaptic phosphoinositide phosphatase that dephosphorylates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to trigger the removal of the clathrin coat during synaptic vesicle recycling 50 . SYNJ1 is a highly constrained gene ( LOEUF score = 0 . 33 ) and rare missense mutations in SYNJ1 have been linked to early - onset Parkinsonism 51 . Despite this , GWA studies have not identified any SNPs proximal to SYNJ1 as being significantly associated with PD , nor have they attributed any significant PD SNP ( near or far ) to SYNJ1 . Critically , we identified that the PD - associated SNP rs10847864 acts as a trans - acting eQTL for SYNJ1 expression . rs10847864 is intronic to , and also acts as a cis - eQTL with , HIP1R , another gene that is involved in clathrin mediated endocytosis 52 – 54 . Our discovery of the trans - eQTL - SYNJ1 connection merges observations from population level ( i . e . GWAS ) and familial studies , reinforcing the potential importance of SYNJ1 in PD . Our analysis identified trans - eQTLs for approximately two - thirds of the known PD - SNPs . Of note , RAI14 ( retinoic acid induced 14 ) is regulated by two trans - eQTLs , involving two independent PD - SNPs ( rs2251086 , chr . 15 and rs55818311 , chr . 19 ) . Although not yet directly linked to PD , RAI14 ( and its encoded protein ankycorbin ) has been shown to play a role in the inflammatory response in glial cells 55 , and in the establishment of neuronal morphology 56 ; both of which are pathways of known importance in PD pathogenesis 57 . Retinoic acid , a regulator of RAI14 ( one of multiple roles of retinoic acid ) , is being explored as a potential therapeutic target for PD 58 . Our results provide support for the role of peripheral tissues in PD , notably the oesophagus and thyroid . Firstly , the oesophagus is enriched for cis and trans regulatory eQTLs . rs76904798 ( PD odds ratio ( OR ) = 1 . 155 ) is an eQTL that upregulates LRRK2 expression in 19 peripheral tissues , including in the oesophagus . Notably , this cis - eQTL with LRRK2 is not identified in any CNS tissues . Secondly , we identified the thyroid tissue as being enriched for eQTLs , many of which were not represented in CNS tissues . The thyroid is a component of the dopaminergic system and hypothalamic – pituitary – thyroid axis network 61 . A potential link between thyroid hormone disorders , PD risk , and symptom severity has been suggested 62 . Specifically , one study identified patients with hypothyroidism to have a two - fold elevated risk of developing PD 63 . Collectively , these findings support the growing body of evidence for the importance of the oesophagus 64 , 65 and thyroid 62 in PD . We hypothesised that genes regulated by PD - SNPs in foetal cortical tissue may contribute to potential neurodevelopmental aspects of PD 24 , 45 , 46 . Sixteen genes were regulated by PD - SNP eQTLs within the foetal cortex . Two of these genes , CNTNAP1 and GALC are particularly notable . CNTNAP1 encodes Caspr1 , a Neurexin family membrane protein . Reductions in Caspr1 concentrations delay cortical neuron and astrocyte formation in the mouse developing cerebral cortex 66 . GALC encodes a lysosomal galactosylceramidase that ensures normal turnover of myelin 67 and has been linked to neuronal vulnerability 68 . While connections between the remaining 14 genes and PD development are less clear , we speculate that SNP mediated regulation of these genes specific to the foetal cortex may contribute to early neuro - developmental disturbances that render an individual more susceptible to PD . Our analyses identified nine clusters that are enriched for specific biological processes and pathways , some of which have not previously been associated with PD . Dysregulated expression of the components within these pathways is potentially the basis of the risk conferred by the PD - SNPs . The clusters aid in understanding how PD SNPs mechanistically contribute to disease risk , and some interesting points can be drawn from these . For example , genes within cluster 6 are enriched for functions in DNA replication and repair , a pathway previously associated with the development of other neurodegenerative diseases 69 . Notably , BRCA1 and RPA2 ( both previously linked to DNA damage response and repair 70 , 71 ) are regulated in trans by PD - SNPs ( rs11950533 ; rs9568188 ; rs62053943 ) and are central to cluster 6 . It is notable that cluster 6 contains several factors associated with PARP1 activity ( e . g . the PARP1 binding protein ( PARPBP ) and BRCA1 ) that link this cluster to the repair of SSBs which are enriched at neuronal enhancers in post - mitotic neurons 72 . A further example is the regulation of autophagy initiation by PD - SNPs , highlighted in cluster 8 . Three interacting proteins within cluster 8 , encoded by VMP1 , BECN1 , and ATG14 are each regulated by a different PD - SNP ( rs12951632 chr . 17 ; rs11158026 chr . 14 ; rs10748818 chr . 10 ; Supplementary table 3 ) , including a trans - eQTL connection regulating VMP1 . rs12951632 ( OR = 0 . 93 ) and rs11158026 ( OR = 0 . 919 ) are protective PD - SNPs that respectively increase BECN1 and ATG14 expression , two interacting core components of the PI3 - kinase complex , required for autophagosome formation 73 . Individuals with both of these variants would potentially have increased autophagic capacity relative to individuals with one variant . The genes in cluster 7 are strongly enriched for antigen processing and presentation – which is increasingly being implicated in the progression of PD 74 . Both rs504594 and rs9261484 are associated with a reduced risk of developing PD ( OR = 0 . 8457 and OR = 0 . 9385 respectively ) . We identified a spatial eQTL between rs504594 and HLA - DRB1 in both the foetal cortex and adult brain ( including cortex and SN ) , implicating this regulatory eQTL - gene connection in both the neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative stages of PD . Interestingly , rs504594 ( previous ID : rs112485776 ) was recently validated in a SNP - level meta - analysis ( OR = 0 . 87 ) , with results displaying no residual HLA effect in adults after adjusting for the SNP 75 . Instead , three amino acid polymorphisms within the HLA - DRB1 gene were identified as drivers of the association between the HLA region and PD risk 75 . We agree that the impacts of rs504594 are contingent upon the HLA - DRB1 allele - both in terms of regulation and protein sequence . We contend that the effects of the rs504594 eQTL are developmental . Future studies must untangle these developmental effects and identify the neurodevelopmental stages that may prime certain individuals to be more vulnerable to later triggering mechanisms . We note that such interpretation should be taken with caution given the highly polymorphic nature of the HLA - region . We acknowledge several limitations to our analysis . Firstly , the Hi - C cohort and GTEx libraries were generated from unrelated samples that were not age or gender matched . Secondly , the sampled donors in GTEx are predominantly of European descent , limiting the significance of our findings to this ethnicity . However , the GWAS cohort also used individuals of European ancestry , meaning for this analysis the datasets were congruent . Thirdly , our eQTL analysis assumes that mRNA concentration correlates directly with protein levels . While it is true that protein levels are to some extent determined by their mRNA concentration , there are many post - transcriptional processes that can lead to a deviation from the expected correlation 76 . The fourth limitation is that eQTL data represent composite datasets across developmental periods ( e . g . foetal samples were aged from 14 - 21 weeks post - conception and the adult samples were from individuals aged 21 - 70 years ) . Despite such limitations , the identification of trans - eQTLs is a particular strength of our methodology , relying on captured contacts within the genome organisation to reduce the impact of multiple testing correction . As such , we contend that these limitations do not invalidate the significance of our findings of trans - acting eQTLs and the genes that they impact . Conclusions Understanding the functional impact of PD - SNPs is critical to our understanding of how these variants contribute to the development and clinical presentation of PD . Our functional interpretation of PD - associated SNPs integrates individual loci into a gene regulatory network , which includes genes with and without prior PD associations . The regulatory network includes clusters , and within them genes , that are enriched for biological functions that have known , putative or previously unknown roles in PD . Development - specific changes to this network ( within the foetal cortex ) are suggestive of roles for neurodevelopmental changes being early contributors to PD disease risk . Similarly , enrichments for regulatory changes within peripheral tissues may indicate a greater role for these tissues in PD than is currently appreciated . Collectively , our findings not only contribute to an overall understanding of the multiple biological pathways associated with PD risk loci , but also highlight the potential utility of gene regulatory networks when considering etiological subtypes of PD .

Rep . 5 , 1 – 9 ( 2015 ) . Figures Figure 1 : Methods workflow . 90 PD - SNPs were obtained from Nalls et al 5 . Spatial interactions between the 90 PD - SNPs and genes were identified from Hi - C libraries ( Supplementary table 2 ) . The resulting spatial SNP - gene pairs were then used to query GTEx v8 to identify significant eQTLs . The resulting SNP - gene pairs were then analysed for functional relevance using multiple tools and databases ( methods ) . Figure adapted from Schierding et al . 19 Figure 2 : Correlation between genotype samples per tissue and number of eQTLs present in the tissue ( a ) Correlation between the number of genotyped samples per tissue ( in GTEx ) and the number of eQTLs ( including cis , trans - intrachromosomal and trans - interchromosomal ) per tissue , in 13 brain - specific tissues ( b ) Correlation between the number of genotyped samples per tissue ( in GTEx ) and the number of cis - eQTLs per tissue , in 13 brain - specific tissues ( c ) Correlation between the number of genotyped samples per tissue ( in GTEx ) and the number of trans - intrachromosomal - eQTLs per tissue , in 13 brain - specific tissues ( d ) Correlation between the number of genotyped samples per tissue ( in GTEx ) and the number of trans - interchromosomal - eQTLs per tissue , in 13 brain - specific tissues ( e ) Correlation between the number of genotyped samples per tissue ( in GTEx ) and the number of eQTLs ( including cis , trans - intrachromosomal and trans - interchromosomal ) per tissue , in all 49 tissues ( f ) Correlation between the number of genotyped samples per tissue ( in GTEx ) and the number of cis - eQTLs per tissue , in all 49 tissues ( g ) Correlation between the number of genotyped samples per tissue ( in GTEx ) and the number of trans - intrachromosomal - eQTLs per tissue , in all 49 tissues ( h ) Correlation between the number of genotyped samples per tissue ( in GTEx ) and the number of trans - interchromosomal - eQTLs per tissue , in all 49 tissues . The tissues that fall furthest from the confidence interval are annotated . The grey dots show the correlation for all GTEx tissues . The 13 brain tissues ( from GTEx ) are indicated by the coloured dots , as shown in the legend . For information on all tissues outside of the 95 % CI see Supplementary table 12 . Figure 3 : Genes subjected to trans - regulation by PD - SNPs are enriched for Loss - of - Function Intolerance . Genes that are loss of function intolerant , as measured by a continuous LOEUF score , are enriched in trans - regulatory interactions involving PD - SNPs . The LOEUF score is a continuous value that indicates the tolerance of a given gene to inactivation . Low LOEUF scores indicate stronger selection against loss - of - function variation . The distribution is shown as a violin plot with the median ( LOEUF ) values for each eQTL group ( black text ) . The groups were compared using a Kruskal - Wallis test ( * * = P value < 0 . 01 ) ; the absence of a significance value indicates the LOEUF values of the two groups were not significantly different . No eQTL = all genes in gnomAD with an assigned pLI or LOEUF for which an eQTL was not identified in this study ( ~ 18 , 500 genes ) . Not all genes had LOEUF scores ( Supplementary figure 2 ; Supplementary table 7 ) Figure 4 : Gene regulation in the foetal cortex compared to the adult cortex . The leftmost section shows genes that are regulated only in the foetal cortex , with no eQTLs seen in any of the 13 adult brain tissues . The middle section shows genes that are regulated in both the foetal and adult cortex . The black dots show the regulation effect size of the gene in the adult cortex , and the grey dots show the regulation effect size of the gene across the different brain tissues ( where an eQTL is seen ) . The rightmost section shows genes that are regulated in both the foetal cortex and adult non - cortical brain tissue . Figure 5 : Louvain Clustering analysis highlights nine significant clusters , indicative of biological connectivity . The grey and orange shading of the nodes is indicative of whether the gene is subject to regulation via cis - or trans - mechanisms . The pink and turquoise shaded circles indicate genes that are regulated in adult brain tissue and foetal cortex respectively . STRING PPI confidence level = high ( 0 . 700 ) ; text - mining connections removed . The clusters were also analysed in STRING with an increased stringency ( including only experimentally determined and curated database connections , confidence level : 0 . 700 ) ; however , this led to very few changes , with cluster 6 the only cluster to lose any connectivity within the cluster ( WDHD1 , NCAPG and PARPBP no longer connect ) . Experimentally determined : imported from experimental repositories ; Gene neighbourhood : similar genomic context in different species suggest a similar function of the proteins ; Gene fusions : fused proteins are recognised by orthology of the fused parts to other , non - fused proteins ; Gene co - occurrence : indicates the presence of a specific gene pair is in agreement in all species – must be expressed together ; Co - expression : predicted association between genes / proteins based on RNA and / or protein expression . Supplementary Figures Supplementary figure 1 : Number of genes regulated per SNP . Each of the 76 SNPs has an eQTL with between 1 and 39 genes . The boxplot represents the median and interquartile range . Supplementary figure 2 : The proportion of genes that are loss of function intolerant increases as the eQTL distance increases . Not all genes have an assigned LOEUF score . The plot shows the percentage of genes that have no assigned score for each of the eQTL categories . Supplementary figure 3 : Genes subject to regulation in non - CNS tissues only . Our analysis identified a subset of 21 PD GWAS SNPs that regulate genes only within non - CNS tissues ( i . e . these SNPs had no regulatory connections within brain tissues ) . Supplementary figure 4 : SNPs co - regulate multiple genes within individual clusters . For each of the seven clusters there is at least one SNP that co - regulates more than one of the genes within that cluster . The SNPs do not co - regulate the genes in the same direction in most instances . In some cases where the SNP regulates the expression of one gene in multiple tissues , the regulation may be positive in some tissues , but negative in others . For example expression of STBD1 is down - regulated in 7 tissues but up - regulated in the testis and lung . Supplementary figure 5 : Genes and variants identified by Makarious et al connect into clusters 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 . Makarious et al identified a set of genes and variants that affect the polygenic risk score for diagnosis of PD . A subset of these genes connect into the clusters identified through our analysis , showing a convergence between the two datasets , and further confirming the importance of the enriched pathways to PD biology . Adapted from main figure 5 . The green shading of the nodes indicates genes that are identified from the Makarious et al dataset .
