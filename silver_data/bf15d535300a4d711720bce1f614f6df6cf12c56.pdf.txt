Qualitative research explores complex phenomena encountered by clinicians , health care providers , policy makers and consumers . Although partial checklists are available , no consolidated reporting framework exists for any type of qualitative design . Objective . To develop a checklist for explicit and comprehensive reporting of qualitative studies ( indepth interviews and focus groups ) . Methods . We performed a comprehensive search in Cochrane and Campbell Protocols , Medline , CINAHL , systematic reviews of qualitative studies , author or reviewer guidelines of major medical journals and reference lists of relevant publications for existing checklists used to assess qualitative studies . Seventy - six items from 22 checklists were compiled into a comprehensive list . All items were grouped into three domains : ( i ) research team and reﬂexivity , ( ii ) study design and ( iii ) data analysis and reporting . Duplicate items and those that were ambiguous , too broadly deﬁned and impractical to assess were removed . Results . Items most frequently included in the checklists related to sampling method , setting for data collection , method of data collection , respondent validation of ﬁndings , method of recording data , description of the derivation of themes and inclusion of supporting quotations . We grouped all items into three domains : ( i ) research team and reﬂexivity , ( ii ) study design and ( iii ) data analysis and reporting . Conclusions . The criteria included in COREQ , a 32 - item checklist , can help researchers to report important aspects of the research team , study methods , context of the study , ﬁndings , analysis and interpretations . Keywords : focus groups , interviews , qualitative research , research design Qualitative research explores complex phenomena encountered by clinicians , health care providers , policy makers and consu - mers in health care . Poorly designed studies and inadequate reporting can lead to inappropriate application of qualitative research in decision - making , health care , health policy and future research . Formal reporting guidelines have been developed for ran - domized controlled trials ( CONSORT ) [ 1 ] , diagnostic test studies ( STARD ) , meta - analysis of RCTs ( QUOROM ) [ 2 ] , observational studies ( STROBE ) [ 3 ] and meta - analyses of observational studies ( MOOSE ) [ 4 ] . These aim to improve the quality of reporting these study types and allow readers to better understand the design , conduct , analysis and ﬁndings of published studies . This process allows users of published research to be more fuller informed when they critically appraise studies relevant to each checklist and decide upon applicability of research ﬁndings to their local settings . Empiric studies have shown that the use of the CONSORT statement is associated with improvements in the quality of reports of randomized controlled trials [ 5 ] . Systematic reviews of qualitat - ive research almost always show that key aspects of study design are not reported , and so there is a clear need for a CONSORT - equivalent for qualitative research [ 6 ] . The Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( ICMJE ) do not provide reporting guidelines for qualitative studies . Of all the mainstream biome - dical journals ( Fig . 1 ) , only the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) has criteria for reviewing qualitative research . However , the guidelines for authors speciﬁcally record that the checklist is not routinely used . In addition , the checklist is not compre - hensive and does not provide speciﬁc guidance to assess some of the criteria . Although checklists for critical appraisal are available for qualitative research , there is no widely endorsed reporting framework for any type of qualitative research [ 7 ] . We have developed a formal reporting checklist for in - depth interviews and focus groups , the most common methods for data collection in qualitative health research .

A . Tong et al . 350 b y gue s t on J anua r y 27 , 2016 D o w n l oaded f r o m publications in health care describe the use of interviews and focus groups [ 8 ] . Interviews In - depth and semi - structured interviews explore the experi - ences of participants and the meanings they attribute to them . Researchers encourage participants to talk about issues pertinent to the research question by asking open - ended questions , usually in one - to - one interviews . The interviewer might re - word , re - order or clarify the questions to further investigate topics introduced by the respondent . In qualitative health research , in - depth interviews are often used to study the experiences and meanings of disease , and to explore per - sonal and sensitive themes . They can also help to identify potentially modiﬁable factors for improving health care [ 9 ] . Focus groups Focus groups are semi - structured discussions with groups of 4 – 12 people that aim to explore a speciﬁc set of issues [ 10 ] . Moderators often commence the focus group by asking broad questions about the topic of interest , before asking the focal questions . Although participants individually answer the facilitator’s questions , they are encouraged to talk and interact with each other [ 11 ] . This technique is built on the notion that the group interaction encourages respondents to explore and clarify individual and shared perspectives [ 12 ] . Focus groups are used to explore views on health issues , programs , interventions and research . Methods Development of a checklist Search strategy . We performed a comprehensive search for published checklists used to assess or review qualitative studies , and guidelines for reporting qualitative studies in : Medline ( 1966—Week 1 April 2006 ) , CINAHL ( 1982— Week 3 April 2006 ) , Cochrane and Campbell protocols , systematic reviews of qualitative studies , author or reviewer guidelines of major medical journals and reference lists of relevant publications . We identiﬁed the terms used to index the relevant articles already in our possession and performed a broad search using those search terms . The electronic databases were searched using terms and text words for research ( standards ) , health services research ( standards ) and qualitative studies ( evaluation ) . Duplicate checklists and detailed instructions for conducting and analysing qualitative studies were excluded . Data extraction . From each of the included publications , we extracted all criteria for assessing or reporting qualitative studies . Seventy - six items from 22 checklists were compiled into a comprehensive list . We recorded the frequency of each item across all the publications . Items most frequently included in the checklists related to sampling method , setting for data collection , method of data collection , respondent validation of ﬁndings , method of recording data , description of the derivation of themes and inclusion of supporting quotations . We grouped all items into three domains : ( i ) research team and reﬂexivity , ( ii ) study design and ( iii ) data analysis and reporting . ( see Tables 2 – 4 ) Within each domain we simpliﬁed all relevant items by removing duplicates and those that were ambiguous , too broadly deﬁned , not speciﬁc to qualitative research , or impractical to assess . Where necessary , the remaining items were rephrased for clarity . Based upon consensus among the authors , two new items that were considered relevant for reporting qualitative research were added . The two new items were identifying the authors who conducted the interview or focus group and reporting the presence of non - participants during the interview or focus group . The COREQ checklist for explicit and comprehensive reporting of qualitative studies consists of 32 criteria , with a descriptor to sup - plement each item ( Table 1 ) . COREQ : content and rationale ( see Tables 1 ) Domain 1 : research team and reﬂexivity ( i ) Personal characteristics : Qualitative researchers closely engage with the research process and participants and are therefore unable to completely avoid personal bias . Instead researchers should recognize and clarify for readers their identity , credentials , occupation , gender , experience and train - ing . Subsequently this improves the credibility of the ﬁndings by giving readers the ability to assess how these factors might have inﬂuenced the researchers’ observations and interpretations [ 13 – 15 ] . ( ii ) Relationship with participants : The relationship and extent of interaction between the researcher and their partici - pants should be described as it can have an effect on the participants’ responses and also on the researchers’ under - standing of the phenomena [ 16 ] . For example , a clinician – researcher may have a deep understanding of patients’ issues but their involvement in patient care may inhibit frank dis - cussion with patient – participants when patients believe that their responses will affect their treatment . For transparency , the investigator should identify and state their assumptions and personal interests in the research topic . Domain 2 : study design ( i ) Theoretical framework : Researchers should clarify the theoretical frameworks underpinning their study so readers can understand how the researchers explored their research questions and aims . Theoretical frameworks in qualitative research include : grounded theory , to build theories from the data ; ethnography , to understand the culture of groups with shared characteristics ; phenomenology , to describe the meaning and signiﬁcance of experiences ; discourse analysis , to analyse linguistic expression ; and content analysis , to sys - tematically organize data into a structured format [ 10 ] . Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research 351 b y gue s t on J anua r y 27 , 2016 D o w n l oaded f r o m ( ii ) Participant selection : Researchers should report how participants were selected . Usually purposive sampling is used which involves selecting participants who share particu - lar characteristics and have the potential to provide rich , rele - vant and diverse data pertinent to the research question [ 13 , 17 ] . Convenience sampling is less optimal because it may fail to capture important perspectives from difﬁcult - to - reach people [ 16 ] . Rigorous attempts to recruit participants and reasons for non - participation should be stated to reduce the likelihood of making unsupported statements [ 18 ] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

( iii ) Setting : Researchers should describe the context in which the data were collected because it illuminates why par - ticipants responded in a particular way . For instance , partici - pants might be more reserved and feel disempowered talking in a hospital setting . The presence of non - participants during interviews or focus groups should be reported as this can also affect the opinions expressed by participants . For example , parent interviewees might be reluctant to talk on sensitive topics if their children are present . Participant characteristics , such as basic demographic data , should be reported so readers can consider the relevance of the ﬁnd - ings and interpretations to their own situation . This also allows readers to assess whether perspectives from different groups were explored and compared , such as patients and health care providers [ 13 , 19 ] . ( iv ) Data collection : The questions and prompts used in data collection should be provided to enhance the readers’ understanding of the researcher’s focus and to give readers the ability to assess whether participants were encouraged to openly convey their viewpoints . Researchers should also report whether repeat interviews were conducted as this can inﬂuence the rapport developed between the researcher and participants and affect the richness of data obtained . The method of recording the participants’ words should be reported . Generally , audio recording and transcription more accurately reﬂect the participants’ views than contemporaneous researcher notes , more so if participants checked their own transcript for accuracy [ 19 – 21 ] . Reasons for not audio record - ing should be provided . In addition , ﬁeld notes maintain con - textual details and non - verbal expressions for data analysis and interpretation [ 19 , 22 ] . Duration of the interview or focus group should be reported as this affects the amount of data obtained . Researchers should also clarify whether participants were recruited until no new relevant knowledge was being obtained from new participants ( data saturation ) [ 23 , 24 ] . Domain 3 : analysis and ﬁndings ( i ) Data analysis : Specifying the use of multiple coders or other methods of researcher triangulation can indicate a broader and more complex understanding of the pheno - menon . The credibility of the ﬁndings can be assessed if the process of coding ( selecting signiﬁcant sections from partici - pant statements ) , and the derivation and identiﬁcation of themes are made explicit . Descriptions of coding and memoing demonstrate how the researchers perceived , exam - ined and developed their understanding of the data [ 17 , 19 ] . Researchers sometimes use software packages to assist with storage , searching and coding of qualitative data . In addition , obtaining feedback from participants on the research ﬁndings adds validity to the researcher’s interpretations by ensuring that the participants’ own meanings and perspectives are represented and not curtailed by the researchers’ own agenda and knowledge [ 23 ] . ( ii ) Reporting : If supporting quotations are provided , researchers should include quotations from different participants to add transparency and trustworthiness to their ﬁndings and interpretations of the data [ 17 ] . Readers should be able to assess the consistency between the data presented and the study ﬁndings , including the both major and minor themes . Summary ﬁndings , interpretations and theories gen - erated should be clearly presented in qualitative research publications . Discussion The COREQ checklist was developed to promote explicit and comprehensive reporting of qualitative studies ( inter - views and focus groups ) . The checklist consists of items speciﬁc to reporting qualitative studies and precludes generic criteria that are applicable to all types of research reports . COREQ is a comprehensive checklist that covers necessary components of study design , which should be reported . The criteria included in the checklist can help researchers to report important aspects of the research team , study methods , context of the study , ﬁndings , analysis and interpretations . At present , we acknowledge there is no empiric basis that shows that the introduction of COREQ will improve the quality of reporting of qualitative research . However this is no different than when CONSORT , QUOROM and other reporting checklists were introduced . Subsequent research has shown that these checklists have improved the quality of reporting of study types relevant to each checklist [ 5 , 25 ] , and we believe that the effect of COREQ is likely to be similar . Despite differences in the objectives and methods of quantitative and qualitative methods , the underlying aim of transparency in research methods and , at the least , the theor - etical possibility of the reader being able to duplicate the study methods should be the aims of both methodological approaches . There is a perception among research funding agencies , clinicians and policy makers , that qualitative research is ‘second class’ research . Initiatives like COREQ are designed to encourage improvement in the quality of reporting of qualitative studies , which will indirectly lead to improved conduct , and greater recognition of qualitative research as inherently equal scientiﬁc endeavor compared with quantitative research that is used to assess the quality and safety of health care . We invite readers to comment on COREQ to improve the checklist . References 1 . Moher D , Schulz KF , Altman D .
