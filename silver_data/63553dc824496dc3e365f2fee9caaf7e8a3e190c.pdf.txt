DOI 10 . 1016 / j . cbpa . 2009 . 03 . 022 Introduction Because most current chemotherapeutic agents distribute indiscriminately into virtually all cells of the body , they can damage both malignant and normal cells alike , often inducing sufﬁcient toxicity to cause the patient to dis - continue treatment . The obvious solution to these unwanted toxicities is to somehow focus the therapeutic potency on the cancer cells , preserving the healthy cells to perform their essential functions . While numerous strat - egies have been proposed to target drugs to tumor cells ( for reviews , see [ 1 – 9 , 10 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] ) , one approach that has received considerable attention has been the use of folic acid to deliver attached drugs selectively to folate re - ceptor - expressing cancer cells [ 10 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 11 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 12 ] . This review will discuss the strengths and weakness of this approach and offer insight into possible clinical applications of the technology . Folate receptor expression The vitamin , folic acid , is required in one carbon meta - bolic reactions , and consequently , is essential for the synthesis of nucleotide bases . Uptake of folates into virtually all cells of the body is mediated by either the reduced folate carrier [ 13 , 14 ] or the proton coupled folate transporter [ 15 ] . Because neither of these membrane - spanning transport proteins displays afﬁnity for folate conjugates , folate - linked drugs show no tendency to bind to most normal cells . Importantly , folic acid can also be internalized by a folate receptor ( FR ) that is expressed on surprisingly few cell types . The alpha isoform of the folate receptor ( FR - a ) is observed on the apical surfaces of several epithelial cells [ 10 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 11 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 16 – 19 ] where it is inac - cessible to parenterally administered folate and folate conjugates . FR - a is also overexpressed on (cid:2) 40 % of human cancers [ 17 , 18 , 20 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 21 , 22 ] where it is completely accessible to folate - linked drugs ( Table 1 ) . FR - b , in contrast , is expressed on activated macrophages and also on the surfaces of malignant cells of hematopoietic origin [ 23 , 24 , 25 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . FR - g and FR - d have been difﬁcult to detect in human tissues , but recent data suggest that FR - d may be found on regulatory T cells [ 26 , 27 ] . Folate and folate conjugates bind to FR - a and FR - b with high afﬁnity ( K d (cid:2) 10 (cid:4) 9 M ) and enter FR - expressing cells by receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 10 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 28 ] . Expression of FR on cancer cells may have arisen as a means to enable the cancer cells to compete more aggres - sively for the low folate concentrations ( (cid:2) 2 (cid:5) 10 (cid:4) 8 M ) normally found in human serum and extracellular ﬂuids [ 11 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . Nevertheless , expression of FR on cancer cells is surprisingly variable ( Table 1 ) , with some malignancies expressing FR ( primarily the alpha isoform ) at very high frequencies , others at intermediate frequencies , and still others not at all [ 11 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 20 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 21 , 22 ] . Because folate is needed in the synthesis of nucleotide bases , and since rapidly dividing cells require nucleotide bases to replicate their DNA , it is believed that malignant cells that do not express FR may upregulate their expression of the reduced folate carrier in order to acquire their needed amounts of the vitamin ( LH Matherly and PS Low , personal observations ) . Accessible FR on normal cells are limited primarily to activated macrophages / monocytes and the proximal tubules of the kidneys [ 10 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 11 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 12 , 23 , 24 , 25 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . Because activated macrophages normally accumulate only at sites of inﬂammation [ 23 , 25 , 29 – 32 ] , uptake of folate conjugates by activated macrophages is seen mainly in patients with inﬂammatory or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , Crohn’s disease , Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2009 , 13 : 256 – 262 www . sciencedirect . com atherosclerosis , sarcoidosis , osteoarthritis , organ trans - plant rejection , ulcerative colitis , and localized infection ( Figure 1a , b ) . In contrast , all individuals display uptake of folate conjugates in their kidneys ( Figure 1c ) , where FR ( a - isoform ) expression is limited to the apical surface of the proximal tubules . At this location , FR - a serves to capture folates ( and folate conjugates ) from the nascent urine and transcytose them back across the kidney epi - thelium to the blood stream [ 33 ] . Thus , kidney FR function as a salvage receptor to prevent loss of this important vitamin in the urine . Because most folate conjugates are not retained in the kidneys , no kidney toxicity has ever been observed in either animals or humans treated with folate - chemotherapeutic agent con - jugates [ 34 – 35 , 36 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 37 – 39 ] . In all tissues where FR is expressed , the receptor has been observed to internalize the attached vitamin / vita - min - conjugate via a process termed receptor - mediated endocytosis [ 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . In this process , multiple FR are seen to cluster on the cell surface , perhaps within lipid rafts , and invaginate to form an early endosome [ 11 , 43 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 44 ] . This early endosome is uniquely suited to assist in drug delivery , since it has been found to contain considerable reducing power , allowing for rapid release of drugs linked to folate via a disulﬁde bond [ 43 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . More importantly , the early endosomes do not remain long at the cell periphery , but rather trafﬁc immediately to a recycling center near the cell nucleus , where the vitamin is separated from its released cargo into distinct vesicles [ 43 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 44 ] . Thus , within this recycling center , the released drug is sorted into an endosome that remains near the cell nucleus , whereas the receptor is moved to a separate endosome that recycles back to the cell surface [ 43 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 44 , 45 ] . Since some researchers reading this article may be interested in targeting nanoparticles , dendrimers , lipoplexes , block copolymers , or liposomes , it should be emphasized that multivalent folate conjugates ( e . g . lipo - somes containing multiple attached folates ) do not follow Folate - targeted cancer therapeutics Low and Kularatne 257 Table 1 Folate receptor expression in selected solid tumors determined primarily by immunohistochemical analysis of cancer tissue microarrays using a monoclonal IgG to FR - a .

Instead , they trafﬁc quickly to lysosomes , where both FR and any digestable cargo are degraded by lysosomal enzymes . Whereas the average pH of endosomes along the monovalent folate conjugate trafﬁcking pathway is 6 . 8 , the average pH of compartments along the multivalent folate conjugate trafﬁcking pathway is 5 . 0 ( Figure 2 ) [ 46 , 47 ] . This lower pH along the multivalent folate conjugate trafﬁcking pathway can be readily exploited for pH - triggered drug release from multivalent folate - polymer complexes using acid labile linkers to tether the drug to the vitamin [ 47 ] . However , the obstacles to tumor penetration encountered by large particles should be carefully considered before switching from small folate conjugates to folate - targeted nanoparticles . Folate - targeted drugs in human clinical trials Because of the overexpression of FR on cancer cells , folate has been exploited to deliver attached drugs to a variety of human malignancies . To illustrate the diverse applications of this targeting technology for tumor - speciﬁc drug delivery , the ﬁrst four folate - targeted drugs to enter human clinical trials will be brieﬂy described below . The initial folate - targeted drug to be tested in humans was 111 In - DTPA - folate ( Figure 3a ) , a folate - conjugated chelator of 111 In that was demonstrated to bind FR with (cid:2) 1 nM afﬁnity [ 48 – 50 ] . As anticipated from the known biodistribution of FR in animals and humans [ 17 , 18 , 20 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 50 , 51 ] , 111 In - DTPA - folate was found to loca - lize speciﬁcally to cancer cells and the kidneys in non - inﬂamed cancer patients ( Figure 1d ) . Because the folate conjugate was observed to clear rapidly from FR - negative tissues with a t 1 / 2 of < 10 min [ 50 ] , it became obvious that folate conjugates not captured by FR would be rapidly excreted from the body ( 97 % via the kidneys in the case of 111 In - DTPA - folate ) [ 48 , 50 , 51 ] . This rapid clearance from FR - negative tissues was considered desirable , since imaging agents that remain in receptor negative tissues contribute only to nonspeciﬁc background , and thera - peutic agents that are retained in nontargeted tissues simply add to off - target toxicity . Because surprisingly little uptake was observed in the muscle , brain , heart , lungs , intestines , liver , bone marrow , and so on ( Figure 1 ) , clinical data obtained from the 111 In - DTPA - folate trial promoted considerable optimism that cytotoxic conju - gates of folic acid might cause less toxicity to normal tissues than their nontargeted counterparts . The rapid clearance of 111 In - DTPA - folate from FR - nega - tive tissues also argued that a radionuclide such as 99m Tc with shorter radioactive half - life ( 6 . 03 hours ) , superior energy of emission ( 140 keV ) , and preferred pathway of decay ( single gamma emission ) could be developed for folate - targeted imaging applications . EC20 , a folate con - jugate of 99m Tc ( Figure 3b ) , was therefore synthesized [ 49 ] , and introduced into the clinic for imaging of cancer patients [ 52 ] . As anticipated , EC20 demonstrated similar tumor selectivity and rapid clearance from FR - negative tissues to that seen with 111 In - DTPA - folate . Because the chemistries of the two folate complexes were signiﬁcantly different , these data suggested that the biodistribution of folate conjugates may be predominantly dictated by the distribution of FR and not by the nature of the folate - linked cargo . The ﬁrst folate - targeted therapeutic agent to enter the clinic was EC17 [ 53 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 54 ] , a folate - linked ﬂuorescent hapten that was designed to enhance the immunogenicity of FR - positive tumors ( Figure 3c ) . In this strategy , the cancer patient is ﬁrst immunized against the potent hapten , ﬂuorescein , by vaccinating the patient with KLH - ﬂuorescein . After induction of a high anti - ﬂuor - escein antibody titer , the patient is treated intravenously with folate - ﬂuorescein ( EC17 ) to label all FR - expressing 258 Next - generation therapeutics Figure 2 Histogram of endosomal compartment pH values encountered by monovalent and multivalent folate conjugates following their uptake by folate receptor - mediated endocytosis [ adapted from Refs . [ 46 , 47 ] . Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2009 , 13 : 256 – 262 www . sciencedirect . com Folate - targeted cancer therapeutics Low and Kularatne 259 Figure 3 Structures of initial four folate - targeted drugs to enter human clinical trials . For EC145 , the mechanism of drug release following intra - endosomal disulfide bond reduction is shown . www . sciencedirect . com Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2009 , 13 : 256 – 262 cancer cells with the immunogenic hapten . By ‘painting’ every cancer cell surface with millions of immunogenic haptens , it was reasoned that a normally immunologically ‘invisible’ malignant cell might be rendered highly ‘visible’ to the immune system , thereby triggering its removal by normal immune mechanisms [ 54 ] . Indeed , in animal tumor models , the targeted hapten strategy was found to promote the rapid inﬂux of antibodies and immune cells into the cancer mass , leading to complete elimination of advanced tumors with little or no toxicity to healthy cells [ 53 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 54 ] . In humans , the therapy has recently completed phase 1 clinical trials with no signiﬁ - cant toxicities , and it is now progressing through phase 2 clinical studies in kidney cancer . The fourth folate - targeted drug to enter clinical trials was EC145 ( Figure 3d ) , a folate conjugate of desacetylvin - blastine hydrazide [ 36 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . In contrast to the aforemen - tioned imaging agents and EC17 , where release of the folate - conjugated drug was considered undesirable , release of desacetylvinblastine hydrazide was essential for its therapeutic activity . Therefore , a reversible linker was required that would discharge the therapeutic war - head in unmodiﬁed form following uptake of the con - jugate by the cancer cell . As seen in Figure 3d , EC145 is equipped with a disulﬁde bond that connects the folate - spacer moiety to the desacetylvinblastine hydrazide . Importantly , this disulﬁde is positioned in the molecule so that reduction of the disulﬁde by endosomal reductases can trigger release of the desacetylvinblastine hydrazide in unmodiﬁed form ( Figure 3d ) [ 55 ] . As will be described below , this same self - immolative linker strategy can be exploited to tether other toxic warheads to a folate targeting ligand . EC145 has performed well in both preclinical and clinical studies . In animal tumor models , EC145 has demonstrated the ability to eliminate even the largest tumors without measureable toxicity to the treated animals [ 36 (cid:3)(cid:3) ] . In human clinical trials , EC145 has met all phase 1 objectives and is now nearing com - pletion of phase 2 trials for treatment of both ovarian and lung cancer . While detailed information on the clinical performance of EC145 will have to await pub - lication by the clinical investigators , one relevant lesson can be shared now that seems to be valid for folate - linked cytotoxic agents in general . Namely , folate tar - geting can resurrect otherwise useful drugs that have proven to be too toxic for human use in their normal nontargeted forms . Thus , whereas nontargeted desace - tylvinblastine failed its phase 1 clinical trial due to extreme toxicity to the ﬁrst few patients injected , its folate - targeted counterpart has demonstrated little toxicity at doses where evidence of anti - tumor activity is observed . Assuming that this observation can be extrapolated to other discarded hypertoxic drugs , ligand targeting may have the potential to return to human use many effective therapeutic agents that have failed initial examination in human subjects . Three additional folate - targeted drugs have more recently entered clinical trials ; however , lessons learned from their development are not signiﬁcantly different from those articulated above . Thus , all three drugs are tethered to folate via a hydrophilic spacer ( to confer water solubility on the entire conjugate ) and a disulﬁde bond ( to allow for facile release of the attached drug following uptake into reducing endosomes ) . Because the released drugs are each hydrophobic , they exhibit the ability to diffuse out of the FR - containing endosomes and distri - bute rapidly throughout the cytoplasm of the FR - expres - sing cell . And as with EC145 , each of the targeted drugs displays signiﬁcantly reduced off - site toxicity compared to its nontargeted counterpart , and this improved toxicity proﬁle is seen without loss in anti - tumor activity . Because most chemotherapies are limited by their toxicities , this reduced toxicity without loss of efﬁcacy can conceivably improve the therapeutic windows of currently useful cancer drugs . Finally , for the purpose of objectivity , it is also important to summarize the limitations associated with FR - targeted drug delivery . First and most obviously , the cancer to be treated must express FR , that is a property not charac - teristic of all cancers ( Table 1 ) . Second , because most FR + cancers express only 1 – 3 million FR / cell [ 20 (cid:3)(cid:3) , 21 , 22 ] , the attached drug must be highly toxic in order for FR endocytosis to deliver sufﬁcient concen - trations of drug to kill the cell . Third , the attached therapeutic cargo must be membrane permeable , since FR + endosomes contain no pores or channels through which hydrophilic or polymeric drugs can diffuse . And ﬁnally , the targeted drugs must contain a derivatizable moiety to which a releasable folate - spacer construct can be attached . Nevertheless , because these limitations are easily surmountable for many cancers and their preferred therapeutic agents , the prospects for clinical success of a folate - targeted drug seem promising . Conclusions In summary , folic acid displays multiple desirable charac - teristics for use in the targeting of cytotoxic drugs and imaging agents to cancer tissue . With careful selection of an ideal cytotoxic warhead and releasable hydrophilic spacer , a folate conjugate that not only reduces off - target toxicity but also improves therapeutic efﬁcacy can now be designed . Moreover , because folate receptors are also overexpressed and accessible on activated macrophages ( i . e . cells responsible for many inﬂammatory diseases ) , opportunities for folate targeting in the imaging and therapy of such pathologies as rheumatoid arthritis , Crohn’s disease , atherosclerosis , sarcoidosis , multiple sclerosis , psoriasis , osteoarthritis , and organ transplant rejection , etc . can now also be envisioned . With the 260 Next - generation therapeutics Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2009 , 13 : 256 – 262 www . sciencedirect . com use of folate and hopefully many additional targeting ligands yet to be discovered , the prospect of therapy without toxicity may soon be a reality .

Proc Natl Am Soc 2006 , 103 : 13878 - 13977 . This reference characterizes the itinerary of folate - drug conjugates following FR - mediated endocytosis and deﬁnes the intracellular com - partment where the disulﬁde bond linking folate to its attached drug is cleaved . It also demonstrates that folate is sorted into a different endosome from the attached drug , and that folate and FR are recycled back to the plasma membrane while the released drug is retained inside the cell . 44 .
