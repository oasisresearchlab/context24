OPEN ORIGINAL ARTICLE Transcripts involved in calcium signaling and telencephalic neuronal fate are altered in induced pluripotent stem cells from bipolar disorder patients HM Chen 1 , 5 , CJ DeLong 2 , 5 , M Bame 1 , I Rajapakse 3 , TJ Herron 4 , MG McInnis 1 , 6 and KS O ’ Shea 2 , 6 Bipolar disorder ( BP ) is a chronic psychiatric condition characterized by dynamic , pathological mood ﬂ uctuations from mania to depression . To date , a major challenge in studying human neuropsychiatric conditions such as BP has been limited access to viable central nervous system tissue to examine disease progression . Patient - derived induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) now offer an opportunity to analyze the full compliment of neural tissues and the prospect of identifying novel disease mechanisms . We have examined changes in gene expression as iPSC derived from well - characterized patients differentiate into neurons ; there was little difference in the transcriptome of iPSC , but BP neurons were signi ﬁ cantly different than controls in their transcriptional pro ﬁ le . Expression of transcripts for membrane bound receptors and ion channels was signi ﬁ cantly increased in BP - derived neurons compared with controls , and we found that lithium pretreatment of BP neurons signi ﬁ cantly altered their calcium transient and wave amplitude . The expression of transcription factors involved in the speci ﬁ cation of telencephalic neuronal identity was also altered . Control neurons expressed transcripts that confer dorsal telencephalic fate , whereas BP neurons expressed genes involved in the differentiation of ventral ( medial ganglionic eminence ) regions . Cells were responsive to dorsal / ventral patterning cues , as addition of the Hedgehog ( ventral ) pathway activator purmorphamine or a dorsalizing agent ( lithium ) stimulated expression of NKX2 - 1 ( ventral identity ) or EMX2 ( dorsal ) in both groups . Cell - based models should have a signi ﬁ cant impact on our understanding of the genesis and therefore treatment of BP ; the iPSC cell lines themselves provide an important resource for comparison with other neurodevelopmental disorders .

The social , personal and vocational consequences are frequently disastrous , 1 and the WHO ranks BP among the top causes of lifelong disability . 2 The heritability of BP is estimated at 80 % and adoption , twin and family studies have consistently identi ﬁ ed a signi ﬁ cant genetic contribution ; 3 , 4 many genes 5 and genetic mechanisms 6 have been implicated in BP , consistent with multiple disease loci , each contributing modest effects . 7 , 8 Genome - wide association studies have identi ﬁ ed a few replicated loci including polymorph - isms in CACNA1C , the alpha subunit of the L - type voltage - gated calcium channel , the strongest and most replicated risk . 5 , 9 – 13 Additional replicated polymorphisms have been identi ﬁ ed in ANK3 , which regulates assembly of voltage - gated sodium channels at the node of Ranvier , 14 , 15 and SYNE1 , which has a critical role in synaptic clustering . 16 Overall , available data suggest that alterations in membrane organization and / or ion channelo - pathies may contribute to BP ; in fact , dysregulation of Ca 2 + signaling is one of the most reproducible observations in BP . 17 Like many complex central nervous system ( CNS ) disorders , the roles of neuropathology , environment and trauma in BP are largely unknown ; there are reports of ventricular enlargement , gray matter , hippocampal and cerebellar hypoplasia , and anoma - lies of white matter tracts , 18 – 21 that are nonspeci ﬁ c and inconsistent . There is also evidence of abnormal neuronal cell migration 22 and of altered adult neurogenesis . 23 , 24 Because viable brain tissue is unavailable , and there is no well - de ﬁ ned genetic event or neuropathology , there are simply no good neural models to study BP . Since subtle alterations in developmental pathways can produce neurological consequences that only become apparent much later in life , 25 , 26 a developmental model to study neuronal differentiation in BP is required . Because they have tri - lineage differentiation potential similar to human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) , induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) provide the 1 Department of Psychiatry , University of Michigan Medical School , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ; 2 Department of Cell and Developmental Biology , University of Michigan Medical School , Ann Arbor , MI , USA ; 3 Center for Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics , Department of Mathematics , University of Michigan Medical School , Ann Arbor , MI , USA and 4 Department of Cardiology , University of Michigan Medical School , Ann Arbor , MI , USA .

The current investigation demonstrates that iPSC from BP patients are similar to controls ( C ) in their tri - lineage differentia - tion capacity and gene expression pro ﬁ les ; however , the expres - sion of membrane receptors and ion channel transcripts was signi ﬁ cantly increased in BP neurons , and different sets of neuronal lineage - speci ﬁ c transcription factors were induced . Consistent with changes in membrane composition , exposure of BP neurons to lithium produced signi ﬁ cant alterations in wave amplitude and calcium transient compared with control neurons . Transcripts involved in dorsal telencephalic fate ( the default identity ) were enriched in control neurons , whereas there was an increase in genes involved in ventral fate and GABAergic interneuron differentiation in BP neurons . The dorsal / ventral neuronal identity of both groups could be in ﬂ uenced by exposure of iPSC to dorsalizing or ventralizing factors . This work provides the ﬁ rst information on gene expression during neuronal differentiation in BP , a rich resource to identify alterations in the differentiation of glia and neurons , as well as an opportunity for comparisons with other neuropsychiatric disorders . MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient population The clinical sample was obtained from the Prechter Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder . 39 Subjects contributing a skin sample were from a psychiatric clinic in a mid - western college city , Caucasian , and were diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Disorder , or healthy unaffected controls were ascertained through advertising on the University of Michigan Clinical Studies website . All participants were assessed clinically using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies . 40 BP patients were determined by clinical evaluation to have a chronic disorder with mood symptoms most of the time , age of onset ranging from 15 to 23 years . Two of three Bipolar 1 Disorder patients were considered lithium responsive and all had exposures to antidepressant , anticonvulsants and antipsychotic medica - tions . One patient had comorbid panic disorder and a second patient was treated for metabolic syndrome with a statin ( rosuvastatin ) and an oral hypoglycemic ( pioglitazone ) . A second patient was receiving levothyrox - ine . Two patients and two controls were 50±5 years age and the other pair were aged 30 and 34 years at time of sample . Four patients were male and two were female . Fibroblast derivation Skin biopsies were obtained in the UM Clinical Research Unit . Samples were dissociated in trypsin , expanded in ﬁ broblast medium comprising Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM , 11965 – 092 ; Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY , USA ) containing 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen , 10082 – 147 ) , 1 % non - essential amino acids ( NEAA ) ( Invitrogen , 11140 – 050 ) , 2 m M glutamax ( Invitrogen , 35050 – 061 ) and 1× Penicillin / Streptomycin solution ( Invitrogen , 15140 – 122 ) to obtain dermal ﬁ bro - blasts . Stock ﬁ broblasts from each patient were banked and cells were analyzed for their expression of ﬁ broblast - restricted genes , pluripotency factors , lineage markers and mycoplasma . Virus preparation Retrovirus was made by transfecting 293FT cells with pUMVC and pCMV - VSV - g plasmids , and individual plasmids : pMXs - h KLF4 , pMXs - h SOX2 , pMXs - h OCT4 or pMXs - h cMYC ( Addgene , Cambridge , MA , USA ) at a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , 11668 - 019 ) . Virus supernatant was collected and combined , ﬁ ltered through a 0 . 45 - μ m ﬁ lter ( EMD Millipore , SCHVU01RE , Billerica , MA , USA ) and concentrated 80 – 100 - fold in a centrifugal ﬁ lter with a 1 00 000 MWCO ( EMD Millipore , UFC910008 ) . The concentrate containing all four factors was then used immediately to transduce ﬁ broblasts at a ﬁ nal concentration between 3 - and 12 - fold . iPSC derivation Fibroblasts at passage 5 – 6 were plated at 5×10 4 cells in 35 - mm tissue culture dishes in ﬁ broblast medium and transduced with retroviral constructs expressing the pluripotency factors OCT4 , SOX2 , KLF4 and c - MYC . 41 Fibroblasts were transduced on day 1 after plating , with daily medium changes from day 3 to day 6 . On day 7 , forming iPSC were trypsinized and passaged to mouse embryonic ﬁ broblast ( MEF ) feeders for expansion in hESC medium compromising DMEM / F12 ( Invitrogen , 11320 - – 032 ) , 20 % KOSR ( Invitrogen , 10828 – 028 ) , 4 ng ml − 1 FGF2 ( EMD Millipore GF003 ) , 1 % NEAA , 2 m M glutamax and 0 . 1 m M β - mercaptoethanol ( Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO , USA , M3148 ) . After 10 days on MEFs , medium was changed to MEF - conditioned hESC medium , then hESC - like colonies manually dissected and passaged to new MEFs for expansion in hESC medium . From each ﬁ broblast line , 5 – 10 colonies were selected for expansion to iPSC lines ; a minimum of 5 – 6 iPSC lines were derived from each ﬁ broblast ( patient ) sample . Pluripotency characterization Analysis of the expression of pluripotency factors NANOG , SOX2 and OCT4 , and cell surface expression of SSEA3 , SSEA4 , TRA - 1 – 60 and TRA - 1 – 81 , and alkaline phosphatase was carried out in immunocytochemistry and polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Controls for pluripotency and differentiation capability include parallel analysis of a well - characterized iPSC line ( UM - C2 ) and H7 or UM4 - 6 hESC lines . Differentiation capacity Assessment of the tri - lineage differentiation capability of the iPSC lines was done by 45 days of culture in non - adherent dishes in hESC medium lacking FGF2 to form embryoid bodies ( EBs ) . Lineage differentiation was assessed using cell - type restricted antibodies and PCR ( Supplementary Figure 1D , Supplementary Tables 1A and B ) . Ectoderm was identi ﬁ ed using nestin or β - III tubulin ; mesoderm : Brachyury , smooth muscle actin or decorin ; and endoderm : Sox17 , alpha - fetoprotein or Foxa2 . Neuronal differentiation iPSCs were manually dissected from MEF , then grown in suspension culture for 4 days in EB medium supplemented with 2 μ M dorsomorphin ( R & D Systems , 3096 ; Minneapolis , MN , USA ) and 5 μ M SB431542 ( R & D Systems , 1614 ) . Medium was then changed to neural induction medium consisting of DMEM / F12 , 1× N2 supplement ( Invitrogen , 17502 - 048 ) , 1× NEAA , 2 m M glutamax , 0 . 1 m M β - mercaptoethanol , 2 μ M dorsomorphin , 5 μ M SB431542 and 20 ng ml − 1 FGF2 for an additional 3 days in suspension . Neurospheres were then planted on laminin ( Sigma - Aldrich , L2020 ) - coated culture dishes for rosette formation . Rosettes were manually picked 2 – 3 times , dissociated in Accutase then re - plated on poly - D - ornithine - laminin - coated substrates for neuronal differentiation in medium composed of neural basal medium ( Invitrogen , 21103 – 049 ) , 1× B27 supplement ( Invitrogen , 17504 – 044 ) , 1 m M glutamine , 1 % NEAA and 1× Penicillin / Streptomycin for an additional 4 , 8 or 12 weeks . Medium was changed every other day . To determine whether dorsal – ventral fate could be respeci ﬁ ed , cells were grown with the Smoothened agonist ( Hedgehog pathway activator ) purmorphamine ( 1 μ m ; Cayman Chemical , Ann Arbor , MI , USA , 10009634 ) , or with the dorsalizing agent lithium chloride ( LiCl ; 1 m M ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Controls were exposed to DMSO ( carrier ) alone . 42 , 43 Reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction Total RNA from iPSCs , EBs or neurons was extracted with Trizol ( Invitrogen , 15596 - 0926 ) , ±5 μ g of UltraPure glycogen ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Waltham , MA , USA ) to enhance RNA recovery . RNA was treated with DNase ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) and reverse transcribed ( Superscript III , Invitrogen ) using random nonamers . The cDNA was then used in PCR ( primers in Supplementary Table 1B ) . Microarray analysis To characterize the iPSC and to determine whether there were differences in their gene expression pro ﬁ les with neuronal differentiation , total RNA iPSC models of BP HM Chen et al 2 Translational Psychiatry ( 2014 ) , 1 – 8 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited was isolated from six individual iPSC cell lines ( 3 BP patients and 3 controls ( C ) ) before and following 8 weeks of neuronal differentiation using the TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen , 15596 - 026 ) . RNAs were DNased followed by the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup reagent ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany , 74204 ) . RNA quantity and quantity were measured in an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) producing RNAs with an integrity measure > 9 . 5 . They were ampli ﬁ ed and hybridized to GeneChip U133 Plus 2 . 0 microarrays ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . Data quality control parameters included scaling factor , noise , background , percentage of present calls , 5 ′ / 3 ′ signal ratios observed in GAPDH mRNA and 5 ′ / 3 ′ signal ratios of spiking genes . Raw data ( U133P2 CEL ﬁ les ) were processed using the Bioconductor package ‘ Affy ’ for R . Normalized Log 2 transformed probe intensity Robust Multi - chip Average values were used in differential gene expression analyses and transcripts with signi ﬁ cantly altered expression ( P ⩽ 0 . 05 ) between BP and controls were identi ﬁ ed using t - test with R and David software . 44 To assess similarities between groups , the Symmetrized Stein Distance was calculated between estimated sample covariance matrices for each sample pair ( BP vs control iPSC , BP vs control neurons and iPSC vs neurons ) . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was calculated using the permutation test . 45 Validation of the microarray results was performed with TaqMan ‘ Assays on Demand ’ ( ABI , Foster City , CA , USA ) for seven genes selected based on fold changes between BP and control samples , using the 2 − ΔΔ Ct method . 46 Only complete sets of iPSC ( 3 BP and 3 C patients ) and neurons ( same 3 BP and same 3 C cell lines from 6 individuals ) were analyzed to minimize stochastic changes due to culture conditions . Calcium signaling To simultaneously measure action potential and wave propagation , we differentiated neurons as described above for an additional 4 – 8 weeks , loaded them with the intracellular calcium - sensitive dye Fluo - 4AM , ( 10 m M , Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , USA ) . After 30 min , non - bound dye was removed and cells were examined in a Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope system ( Nikon Corporation , Chiyoda , Tokyo , Japan ) to identify spontaneous activity . To evoke action potentials , 50 m M KCl was added to the dish and signaling was recorded . 47 To determine whether lithium pretreatment would alter signaling , sets of neurons ( 3 BP and 3 C ) were cultured in the presence of LiCl ( 1 m M ) for 24 h before loading and image Figure 1 .

Reprogrammed colonies of iPSC form and are passaged to MEFs . They downregulate Te - 7 ( c ; Cy3 - secondary antibody ) , and exhibit nuclear expression of Nanog ( d ; FITC - secondary antibody ) . For differentiation , cells are removed from MEF and grown in de ﬁ ned medium as neurospheres ( e ) , then plated to form rosettes ( f ) . Rosettes are picked twice , then differentiated in adherent culture in de ﬁ ned medium forming nestin + ( g ; FITC - secondary antibody ) neural progenitor cells , and with additional time in vitro undergo widespread differentiation to β - III tubulin + neurons ( h ; Cy3 - secondary antibody ) , with punctate expression of Synapsin 1 ( Syn1 ) along their processes ( i , Cy3 - secondary antibody ) . All cells , but a , are stained with Hoechst 23487 ( blue ) to identify nuclei .

For image analysis , regions of interest were de ﬁ ned as cell bodies or axons , and wave amplitude and propagation were measured from 5 to 10 regions per sample . RESULTS Cells Fibroblast lines have been derived from 22 BP and 10 C patients , expanded and banked to 12 stock vials ( or cryostraws ) from each patient . From 3 BP and 3 C ﬁ broblast cell lines , we have reprogrammed at least 3 iPSC lines per individual ( BP iPSC = 28 ; C iPSC = 14 ) . With reprogramming , ﬁ broblast - restricted genes were downregulated ( Figures 1a – c ; Supplementary Figure 1A ) and expression of pluripotency factors was induced ( Figure 1d ; Supplementary Figures 1B and C ) . Cells expressing markers of all three germ layers ( ectoderm , endoderm and mesoderm ) formed following EB differentiation ( Supplementary Figure 1D ) . With differentiation of neurospheres ( Figure 1e ) followed by neural rosettes ( Figure 1f ) Sox1 , Sox2 , Sox3 , Pax6 and nestin were expressed ( Figure 1g , Supplementary Figure 2 ) . After 4 weeks , neurons with dendrites and axons expressing MAP2 , TauAB and β - III tubulin ( Figure 1h ) formed . Neurons adopted a largely forebrain phenotype , with VGlut + pyramidal - shaped neurons , GABA + interneurons , scattered serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons present in the cultures . Many expressed punctate Synapsin1 along their neurites ( Figure 1i ) , with little glial ﬁ brillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) in the cultures . Microarray analysis Pooled data : BP and control . Analysis of the 54 676 probesets identi ﬁ ed 20 550 unique transcripts expressed in iPSC and 20 718 in neuronally differentiated cells . We replicated ﬁ ve out of seven genes selected from our microarray in quantitative reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction , supporting the validity of these results ( Supplementary Table 1C ) . In the iPSC samples , 2538 transcripts were expressed at signi ﬁ cantly different levels ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) . KEGG pathway analysis identi ﬁ ed one signi ﬁ cant pathway in the iPSC , calcium signaling , n = 39 , P ⩽ 2 . 5 × 10 − 2 , Bonferroni correction . Many of these transcripts are associated with neuroplasticity and development , others with stress - activated pathways ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Of the 20 718 transcripts identi ﬁ ed in neuronally differentiated iPSC , 1835 transcripts were differentially expressed between groups ( nominal P ⩽ 0 . 05 ) , but KEGG pathway analysis did not identify signi ﬁ cantly altered pathways in the neuronal population . Additional analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts did not identify signi ﬁ cant differences between BP vs control iPSC ( distance = 0 . 036 , P ⩽ 0 . 072 ) , not surprisingly pooled iPSC vs neurons were signi ﬁ cantly different ( distance = 0 . 174 , P ⩽ 0 . 012 ) . Interestingly , BP and control neurons were also signi ﬁ cantly different in their transcriptomes ( distance = 0 . 103 , P ⩽ 0 . 041 ) ; Supplementary Figure 3B . Within - groups analysis : BP iPSC vs BP neurons and control iPSC vs control neurons Transcripts expressed in iPSC and neurons : There were 14 993 unique transcripts that were signi ﬁ cantly differentially expressed in BP iPSC compared with neurons derived from them ; there were 15 311 transcripts in control iPSC vs control neurons that were signi ﬁ cantly altered . Of these , 7242 transcripts were expressed at twofold or higher levels in BP iPSC , 5120 were expressed at ⩾ twofold levels in BP - derived neurons . In control cells , 7098 unique transcripts were expressed at twofold or higher levels in iPSC and 5089 at ⩾ twofold levels in neurons . i . Transcripts enriched in iPSC Functional Annotation Chart Analysis identi ﬁ ed 475 Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms associated with genes expressed at signi ﬁ cantly higher levels in BP iPSC than in differentiated BP neurons ; 463 terms in control iPSC vs neurons . These included transcripts involved in cell cycle control , RNA binding and genes involved in development ( Table 1 summarizes clusters involved in early differentiation ) . Both sets of iPSC express similar pluripotency factors , positive regulators of cell cycle , genes involved in very early embryonic development , signaling molecules , and factors involved in proliferation . They express few anterior - posterior patterning factors ( HOX ) and numerous genes involved in chromatin modi ﬁ cation . There were slight variations in the expression of individual transcripts between groups , but the functional sig - ni ﬁ cance , if any , of these differences is not known . ii . Transcripts enriched in neurons Transcripts associated with 425 Gene Ontology categories were signi ﬁ cantly increased in BP neurons compared with BP iPSC ; 437 in control neurons compared with control iPSC ( Table 2 describes categories involved in neuronal differentiation ) . With neuronal differentiation , transcripts associated with pluripotency , positive control of the cell cycle , and many chromatin remodeling factors were downregulated , whereas genes involved in signaling , transcripts associated with anterior - posterior patterning ( HOX genes ) and SOX genes were induced with differentiation . Cell surface molecules , many involved in neurite outgrowth , and transcripts that encode membrane channels were also upregulated with neuronal differentiation . Transcripts involved in early neuronal differentiation including ELAVL1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; FOXP1 ; MAP2 ; MAPT ; MBD2 ; NEFL , NEFM and NRG1 – 4 were increased , whereas genes associated with glial lineage differentiation were not identi ﬁ ed in BP , but GFAP was present in controls . Transcripts previously suggested to be dysregulated in BP , including ANK3 , CACNA1C , GSK3 β ( glycogen synthase kinase 3 Table 1 .

Neurons differentiated from BP and control iPSC expressed similar sets of transcripts , many associated with neuronal differentiation , synapses and channel activity . iPSC models of BP HM Chen et al 4 Translational Psychiatry ( 2014 ) , 1 – 8 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited beta ) , MECP2 , NCAN , SYNE1 and ZNF804A , were signi ﬁ cantly upregulated as both control and BP iPSC differentiated to neurons , whereas BDNF and DISC1 were not changed . The ribonuclease DICER1 , which is involved in microRNA processing , was signi ﬁ cantly higher in BP but not control neurons . Factors involved in ventral neuronal fate such as NKX2 - 1 and PAX2 were signi ﬁ cantly induced in BP , whereas transcripts involved in dorsal fate such as EMX2 ( dorsal telencephalon ) , and HOX genes ( HOXA1 , 6 , 7 ) required for positional identity and regional differ - entiation of the hindbrain were signi ﬁ cantly higher in control neurons . These data demonstrate that with neuronal differentiation , cells withdraw from cell cycle , express different sets of signaling molecules than iPSC and express largely overlapping sets of neuronal lineage markers . Enrichment of dorsal telencephalic transcripts , such as PAX6 and EMX2 , and the cortical determinate LHX2 ( ref . 48 ) in control and expression of ventral determinates , such as PAX2 and NKX2 - 1 ( basal forebrain progenitors 49 ) , involved in formation of the medial ganglionic eminence and GABAergic interneuron differentiation 50 in BP neurons suggest that neuronal identity is altered , as mutual inhibition between PAX6 and NKX2 - 1 determines dorsal / ventral boundaries in the telencephalon . 51 Between - groups comparisons : BP vs control cells Analysis of pluripotent cells : There were 2547 unique transcripts expressed at signi ﬁ cantly different levels in iPSC derived from BP vs control individuals . i . Transcripts enriched in BP vs control iPSC One - hundred eighty - six transcripts were expressed at 1 . 5 - fold or greater levels in iPSCs derived from individuals with BP compared with control iPSCs . There were 14 signi ﬁ cant clusters of genes ( Table 3i ) in this group . Many transcripts previously associated with neurodevelop - mental / neuropsychiatric disorders or susceptibility loci for BP were identi ﬁ ed ( Supplementary Tables 3 – 7 ) . ii . Transcripts enriched in control vs BP iPSC Forty - six transcripts were expressed 1 . 5 - fold or higher in iPSC from control vs BP individuals , including genes involved in cell polarity and in lineage differentiation , including the TOR complex2 factor RICTOR , which regulates cell growth . There was one cluster of transforming growth factor - β - related transcripts that was signi ﬁ cantly increased ( Table 3ii ) . Members of this cluster included GDF3 and INHBE that have been associated with proliferation and pluripotency and are expressed in the ICM and / or in hESC , 52 whereas LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 are involved in nodal inhibition , neural induction and early embryo patterning . 53 None was previously associated with psychiatric or human neurodevelopmental disorders . These data indicate that iPSC from BP and control cells are strikingly similar in their transcriptional repertoire . No genes associated with the core regulatory mechanisms that maintain pluripotency were differen - tially expressed in these two populations . iii . Genes enriched in BP vs control neurons Of the 1312 unique transcripts that were altered in neurons , 140 transcripts were increased 1 . 5 - fold or greater in BP , including transcripts associated with cell – cell and / or cell – matrix interactions and with axon outgrowth , with neuronal differentiation , organization of synapses , secreted growth factors , and neurotransmitters and their receptors . Many membrane - associated channel genes , transcripts involved in methylation and control of gene expression and with the cytoskeleton were also increased in BP neurons . Functional Annotation Cluster Analysis identi ﬁ ed plasma mem - brane part and ion transport as signi ﬁ cantly increased in BP neurons ( Table 4iii ) . Both clusters ( Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 ) contained transcripts previously associated with neurode - velopmental / neuropsychiatric disorders , as well as BP susceptibility loci . Table 3 .

Enriched in control vs BP neurons Ninety - ﬁ ve transcripts were expressed 1 . 5 - fold or higher in control vs BP neurons , including genes involved in cytoskeletal organization and function , cell surface / extracellular matrix factors , apoptosis , DNA repair , in cell cycle , and in signaling . Genes involved in early neuronal differentiation and in dorsal patterning of the CNS including EMX2 , EOMES , TCF3 as well as VGLUT1 ( SLC17A7 ; previously reported to be decreased in BP 54 ) were enriched in control but not BP neurons ; there was a single signi ﬁ cant cluster of nuclear factors ( Table 4iv ; Supplementary Table 10 ) . Several patterning factors were altered in BP vs control neurons . HOXA1 , A6 and A7 that are expressed in the cerebellum and brainstem were signi ﬁ cantly increased in control neurons , consistent with clinical reports of cerebellar hypoplasia 20 , 21 , 55 in BP . Of transcripts associated with circadian rhythm , TIPIN , PENK and TAC1 were expressed at signi ﬁ cantly higher levels in BP vs control neurons ; whereas in iPSC NPAS2 was expressed at signi ﬁ cantly lower levels in BP vs controls ; CRY1 and RORA were expressed at higher levels . Comparisons with other data sets We previously examined gene expression in postmortem RNA samples from the premotor cortex of controls , from individuals with BP taking typical antipsychotic medications ( BP + ) , and from unmedicated patients with BP ( BP − ) . Remarkably , gene expression pro ﬁ les of BP + were more similar to controls than to BP − . 56 When differentially expressed transcripts from BP − brain were compared with those from BP iPSC - derived neurons , 151 signi ﬁ cantly altered genes were identi ﬁ ed ; 57 genes were expressed in a similar direction ( χ 2 = 651 ; P ⩽ 1×10 − 7 ) including transcripts involved in cell migration , calcium signaling and neurotransmitter receptors ( Supplementary Table 11 ) . Compared with the genes enriched in schizophrenia patient - derived iPSC neurons , 35 nine were signi ﬁ cantly different in bipolar vs control neurons in our study . SOX6 and FGFR3 were down - regulated in both , whereas FGF14 , LGALS8 , PDE4D , RHOBTB3 , SLC41A2 , UNC5C and ZMAT4 were expressed at higher levels in schizophrenia and BP than in control neurons . Compared with an analysis of neurons differentiated from iPSC from patients with Timothy Syndrome ( CACNA1C mutation 37 ) , 233 genes were expressed in a similar pattern as in BP neurons , including many transcripts involved in neuronal differentiation . Clearly , it will be important to compare our analyses with those of additional BP tissue , cell and mouse models . Patterning The MGE marker NKX2 - 1 was expressed within rosettes and in cells rapidly migrating from them , whereas EMX2 was expressed at the base of the rosette where cells were beginning to differentiate ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Control neurons expressed more EMX2 and less NKX2 - 1 than BP neurons regardless of culture conditions ; PAX6 was expressed in rosettes in both groups . Both BP and control iPSC could be patterned by exposure to the Hedgehog pathway activator purmorphamine by increasing the number of NKX2 - 1 - positive cells ( Supplementary Figures 4A and D ) or to LiCl by increasing the number of neurons expressing EMX2 ( Supplementary Figures 4C and F ) . Calcium signaling By 12 weeks , spontaneous neuronal ﬁ ring could be observed in these cultures . Lithium pretreatment of BP neurons signi ﬁ cantly decreased their calcium transient ( 101 . 65 ±31 . 64 vs 290 . 22 ±0 . 52 sec ; P ⩽ 0 . 007 ) and wave amplitude ( 0 . 76 ±0 . 07 vs 1 . 89± 0 . 26 Δ F / F 0 ; P ⩽ 0 . 004 ) compared with lithium - exposed control neurons ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . We also observed that clusters of soma were capable of clearing Ca2 + more rapidly than axon - and dendrite - rich regions . DISCUSSION There is a clear need for cell - based models of BP to test genetic and epigenetic factors , the role of the environment ( particularly stress ) , to determine when neuronal differentiation is affected , and to identify and test new therapeutic approaches . The recent discovery that four transcription factors can reprogram adult somatic cells into PSCs 41 has provided an important tool to study human disease . 31 , 57 , 58 In addition to interrogating the many hypotheses regarding the etiology of BP , the iPSC will be useful in modeling and comparing with other neuropsychiatric disorders that have developmental or affective phenotypes . The banked ﬁ broblast lines also provide a valuable resource for direct reprogramming of the desired cell or neuronal subtype and for alternative reprogramming technologies . The expression of factors associated with pluripotency as well as their tri - lineage differentiation capability , support the successful reprogramming of dermal ﬁ broblasts to iPSC . Not surprisingly , BP and control iPSCs did not differ signi ﬁ cantly in their transcriptional pro ﬁ les . Although there were many similarities in gene expression , there were differences that will allow us to begin to examine the pathways previously suggested to be affected in BP and those identi ﬁ ed in this study including calcium signaling and microRNA processing . Neurons differentiated from BP iPSC were signi ﬁ cantly different in their gene expression pro ﬁ le from those derived from control iPSC . BP neurons expressed more membrane receptors and ion channel genes than control neurons , particularly transcripts involved in calcium signaling . Subtle dysregulation of calcium signaling has been suggested to generate inappropriate neuronal responses and enhance the tonic excitability that maintains brain rhythms in BP . 59 Calcium signaling also has a critical role in development , synaptic plasticity and homeostasis of the CNS ; misregulation during development can produce subtle but widespread alterations in lineage differentiation and plasticity throughout the nervous system and may in ﬂ uence susceptibility to BP . 60 Our preliminary analyses suggest that calcium signaling is also altered in BP neurons and is sensitive to lithium pretreatment . Lithium acts both pre - and post - synaptically , can alter calcium uptake and intracellular levels , and via GSK3 β can be neuropro - tective . It will now be possible to examine the detailed effects of lithium exposure as well as effects of other BP drugs and other signaling pathways in these cells . These results support the concept that many complex , neuropsychiatric disorders that are identi ﬁ ed later in life , including BP , 61 – 63 may result from alterations in neural differentiation that occur during development . BP neurons expressed transcripts involved in the differentiation of ventral neuronal subtypes , including FOXP2 and NKX2 - 1 , the hallmark of the medial ganglionic eminence , 51 whereas controls expressed higher levels of factors that confer ( or maintain ) dorsal telencephalic neuronal identity , including EMX2 , PAX6 , TBR2 , TCF3 and ZNF536 . As telencephalic neurons are involved in a number of neurodegen - erative ( Huntington ’ s disease and Alzheimer ’ s disease ) and neurodevelopmental conditions ( autism spectrum disorder , schi - zophrenia , BP and Rett syndrome ) , alterations in subtype speci ﬁ cation may begin to explain the origin or susceptibility to these conditions . 64 Because lithium activates WNT pathway signaling , dorsalizing early CNS progenitors , 26 lithium treatment may re - direct neural stem cell fate to dorsal cortical derivatives . Many additional mechanisms may be involved , for example , FOXP2 ( expressed at high levels in BP , but not control neurons ) binds the DISC1 promoter , 65 thereby potentially affecting cell migrations and cortical layering . There were no obvious differ - ences in the expression of transcripts for Hedgehog , Wnt or BMP iPSC models of BP HM Chen et al 6 Translational Psychiatry ( 2014 ) , 1 – 8 © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited family members between groups , but the signi ﬁ cant increase in transcripts encoding transforming growth factor - β family mem - bers in control iPSC may suggest a mechanism underlying the observed differences in dorsal / ventral neuronal phenotypes between groups . Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an increase in the num - ber of BP neurons expressing the MGE marker NKX2 - 1 , whereas EMX2 was expressed by more control neurons . iPSC remained sensitive to patterning factors as demonstrated by treatment with the Hedgehog pathway activator purmorphamine or to LiCl . Interestingly , preliminary data also demonstrate that this early patterning is maintained with differentiation , with BP neurons expressing higher levels of somatostatin than controls . Consider - able research remains to be done to determine the timing and extent to which these alterations are maintained . The observation that DICER1 was signi ﬁ cantly increased in BP neurons suggests a potential mechanism to explain the growing consensus that multiple genes may be misregulated in BP . As microRNAs alter the translation of as many as 70 % of all human genes , 66 alterations in microRNA production would affect multiple gene products . MicroRNA levels are altered in postmortem brain tissue of BP patients , 67 , 68 and are sensitive to lithium . 69 – 72 MicroRNAs have critical roles in neural development , 73 – 75 as well as in the adult brain ; 76 misregulation would therefore be expected to produce both short - and longer term affects on CNS development and function . Current work is in progress to expand the patient sample , to examine microRNA expression , to determine the extent to which patterning can be in ﬂ uenced by growth factors 42 , 43 or by the complex three - dimensional microenvironment of the differentiat - ing and mature brain , with the longer term goals of developing new animal models , and ultimately to identify new therapeutic approaches to this intractable disorder .
