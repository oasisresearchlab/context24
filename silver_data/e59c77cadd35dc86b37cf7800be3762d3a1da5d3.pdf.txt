The 2 . 2 A˚ Resolution Structure of the O ( H ) Blood - group - specific Lectin I from Ulex europaeus { Gerald F . Audette , Margaret Vandonselaar and Louis T . J . Delbaere * Department of Biochemistry University of Saskatchewan 107 Wiggins Road , Saskatoon Saskatchewan , Canada S7N 5E5 The tertiary and quaternary structure of the lectin I from Ulex europaeus ( UE - I ) has been determined to 2 . 2 A˚ resolution . UE - I is a dimeric metallo - glycoprotein that binds the H - type 2 human blood group determinant [ a - L - Fuc a ( 1 ! 2 ) - b - D - Gal b ( 1 ! 4 ) - b - D - GlcNAc a - ] . Nine changes from the published amino acid sequence were necessary to account for the electron density . The quaternary structural organization of UE - I is that of the most commonly occurring legume lectin dimer . The tertiary structure of the monomeric subunits is similar to that in the conventional lectin sub - unit ; however , some structural differences are noted . These differences include a four - stranded anti - parallel ‘‘S’’ sheet in UE - I versus the ﬁve - stranded S sheet in other lectin monomers . The Ala residue of the Ala - Asp cis - peptide bond present in the carbohydrate - binding site of the conventional lectin monomer is replaced with a Thr in the UE - I structure . Also , a novel disulﬁde bridge linking Cys115 and Cys150 is present . There are two metallic ions , one calcium and the other manganese , per subunit . N - linked oligosaccharides are at residues 23 and 111 of each sub - unit . One molecule of R - 2 - methyl - 2 , 4 - pentanediol ( R - MPD ) is present in a shallow depression on the surface of each subunit . In order to examine the binding of the H - type 2 blood group determinant by UE - I , its b - methyl glycoside ( H - type 2 - OMe ) was docked into the binding site of R - MPD . The epitope previously identiﬁed for H - type 2 - OMe by chemical mapping proved , with only minor adjustment of amino acid residues , to be complementary to the shallow cavity occupied by R - MPD in the struc - ture . Several key interactions have been proposed between the H - type 2 - OMe and UE - I . # 2000 Academic Press Keywords : Ulex europaeus lectin I ; H - type 2 human blood group determinant ; protein - carbohydrate interaction ; X - ray crystallography ; chemical mapping * Corresponding author Introduction Lectins are a class of proteins which display a polyvalent afﬁnity for oligosaccharides . Their poly - valency arises from the association of their mono - valent subunits into mainly dimeric or tetrameric molecules . 1 The association of the individual lectin subunits within the molecule is normally by speciﬁc non - covalent interactions of complemen - tary oligopeptide regions on their surfaces . A wide variety of different lectins are present in living cells and tissues . Their carbohydrate speciﬁcity is akin to antigenic recognition by antibodies 2 and enzy - matic substrate speciﬁcity , 3 yet lectins are neither products of the immune system nor do they exhibit enzyme - like catalytic properties . The role of lectins appears limited to speciﬁc cross - linking inter - actions , which allow lectins to serve as recognition molecules for a wide variety of biological events . 4 Lectins from leguminous plants have come under considerable study in recent years . Though it has been suggested that legume lectins play roles in { This manuscript is dedicated to the memory of Professor Raymond U .

However , the speciﬁcity of carbo - hydrate recognition by legume lectins , coupled with their abundance in legume seeds , ease of puriﬁcation , and non - enzymatic action have made lectins attractive biochemical tools . The ﬁrst lectin from the seeds of Ulex europaeus ( common gorse ) ( UE - I ) has been shown to agglutinate type O erythrocytes . 7 These cells , being devoid of A or B activity , were originally desig - nated as having zero ( O ) activity . 8 In fact , the term - inal trisaccharide unit on the surface of O - type cells proved to be the precursor of the A and B blood group determinants . This terminal trisac - charide unit is the H - type 2 determinant , which is recognized by UE - I . 9 The agglutination of O - type erythrocytes by UE - I is inhibited by an H - type 2 blood group substance , a glycoprotein present in the saliva of about 80 % of normal individuals who are termed secretors . 10 , 11 Another H activity may be present on the red cells of normal individuals ; namely that expressed by H - type 1 antigens , which is only very weakly recognized by UE - I . 12 , 13 Indeed , UE - I is used in assays for H - type 2 deter - minants in the presence of H - type 1 substances ; 11 in clinics , the O designation is reserved for the H - type 2 activity . The H - type 1 determinant [ a - L - Fuc a ( 1 ! 2 ) - b - D - Gal ( ( 1 ! 3 ) - b - D - GlcNAc a - ] differs from the H - type 2 determinant ( Figure 1 ) only in the position of the linkage of the b - D - Gal to the b - D - GlcNAc unit of the trisaccharide . The H - type 1 substances are formed in epithelial cells by way of a fucosyl transferase that can complete the syn - thesis of both H - type 1 and H - type 2 trisaccharides . 14 Conversely , the H - type 2 determi - nant originates in the endothelia from a speciﬁc fucosyl transferase that does not synthesize the H - type 1 determinant . 11 UE - I is a homodimeric metalloglycoprotein ; each subunit is approximately 27 kDa in molecular weight based on the published primary sequence . 15 As a result of the present X - ray analysis , modiﬁ - cations to the primary sequence and the locations of the N - linked oligosaccharides were necessary to account for the electron density observed . Studies into the speciﬁcity of carbohydrate rec - ognition by lectins have been greatly assisted by the development of methodologies for the syn - thesis of complex oligosaccharides . 16 Inhibition stu - dies into the binding of H - type 2 and several congeners by UE - I ( Table 1 ) have revealed several key interactions between the lectin and carbohydrate . 13 , 17 A method was applied for the systematic chemical mapping for the detection of the H - type 2 epitope that is bound by UE - I . 18 The chemical mapping 19 is based on the crystal struc - ture of the fourth lectin from Griffonia simplicifolia ( GS - IV ) in complex with the Lewis b blood group determinant , a tetrasaccharide . 20 This method has proven successful for the delineation of the inter - actions between methyl a - isomaltoside and the glucoamylase enzyme as could be judged from the crystal structure of the inhibitor acarbose / enzyme complex . 3 The present project was initiated , in part , to provide further validation of the method by examination of UE - I in complex with the b - methyl glycoside of the H - type 2 deter - minant ( H - type 2 - OMe ) . Although the complex has been difﬁcult to crystallize , useful crystals of the native lectin were produced . 21 This report provides the details of the X - ray structure of UE - I to 2 . 2 A˚ resolution . It has been found that the H - type 2 - OMe epitope docked into the crystal structure of UE - I is in good agreement with that predicted by chemical mapping . Results and Discussion Quality of the final model The structure of UE - I reported herein was obtained by reﬁning the model with an initial data set at 2 . 8 A˚ resolution and subsequently with a separate data set to 2 . 2 A˚ resolution ( diffraction data in Table 2 ) . In the electron density maps , no electron density was observed for the ﬁnal two Figure 1 .

An N - linked heptasaccharide was found attached to Asn23 of subunit A , whereas a trisaccharide was located at Asn111 of both sub - units . A GlcNAc residue may be present at Asn23 of subunit B , however , the electron density was not well resolved . There are 192 solvent ( water ) molecules present in the ﬁnal model , and a mol - ecule of R - MPD was found bound in a shallow cavity on the surface of both subunits . The stereo - chemical quality of the ﬁnal model was analyzed using the program PROCHECK ; 22 89 . 0 % of the residues are within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot , and the remaining 11 . 0 % are in the additional allowed regions . Mean coordinate error from Luzatti plot analysis 23 is 0 . 1 A˚ . The ﬁnal reﬁnement statistics are summarized in Table 2 . The Structure of UE - I Nine amino acid residues in each subunit appear in the electron density maps to be different from those found in the published sequence . 15 Residues 23 and 111 , sequenced as Asp and Glu residues , respectively , were changed to an Asn residue because clearly carbohydrate was attached at those positions . Residues 115 and 150 , sequenced as Asp and Arg residues , respectively , were changed to a Cys residue due to a disulﬁde bridge connecting these two residues in both subunits . The other changes , Val65 to a Leu residue , Asp137 to a Trp residue , Gly218 to a Ser residue , Asn237 to a Thr residue , and Leu238 to a Phe residue were made on the basis of the shape of the electron density for the side - chains at a 2 s contour level . Asn116 was deleted from the model in both subunits because it could not be accommodated in the electron density map . The sequence from residue 117 to 243 was retained with the same numbering as the pub - lished sequence . Including the total 242 amino acid residues with the changes in the primary sequence , the resultant molecular weight of each polypeptide subunit is 26 , 606 Da . Subunit A is more ordered in the crystal than subunit B . The electron density map for the back - bone atoms in subunit A is continuous at a 2 s con - tour level while the map for the second subunit has many gaps in backbone density at 2 s but is continuous at a 1 s contour level . Subunit A has four side - chains : Glu28 , Lys83 , Asn240 , and Thr241 for which there is little electron density , while sub - unit B has six side - chains : Glu28 , Asp39 , Asn40 , Lys83 , Lys114 , and Asn240 . Residues at these pos - itions were replaced with alanine during structure reﬁnement . The average B - factors for subunit A are 22 . 5 A˚ 2 and 25 . 0 A˚ 2 for main - chain and side - chain atoms , respectively , while the corresponding B - fac - tors for subunit B are 45 . 8 A˚ 2 and 46 . 5 A˚ 2 , respect - ively . The lower B - factors of subunit A suggest stronger crystal packing interactions in the unit cell for this subunit . Indeed , examination of symmetry interactions indicates that there are 97 contacts ( < 4 . 1 A˚ ) between subunit A and symmetry - related molecules , whereas subunit B only makes 40 con - tacts with other molecules in the crystal . Legume lectins form several different quaternary structures , which are either dimeric or tetrameric in organization . Of the dimeric lectins , the most common quaternary structure is the dimer initially described for the concanavalin A lectin ( Con A ) 24 and subsequently described in several other lectins ( reviewed by Loris et al . ( 1995 ) ) . 25 Three other dimeric forms are described in the literature , these being the Erythrina corallodendron lectin ( EcorL ) 26 the lectin IV of Griffonia simplicifolia ( GS - IV ) , 20 and the stem / leaf lectin of Dolichos biﬂorus ( DB58 ) . 32 The tetrameric organization has been described for several lectins : the peanut lectin ( PNA ) , 27 , 28 soy - bean agglutinin ( SBA ) , 29 phytohemagglutinin - L ( PHA - L ) , 30 lectin II from Ulex europaeus ( UE - II ) , 31 and the seed lectin from D . biﬂorus ( DBL ) . 32 Although the quaternary structures of reported legume lectins differ widely , the secondary and tertiary structures of the lectin subunit are rela - tively constant . The legume lectin fold was initially described as consisting of two anti - parallel Table 2 . Summary of data collection and reﬁnement statistics A .

Ulex europaeus Lectin I 425 b - sheets , 24 , 33 a six - stranded back sheet and a 12 - stranded front sheet . More recently , this has evolved into a more detailed description of three b - sheets : a six - stranded back sheet , a seven - stranded front sheet , and a ﬁve - stranded ‘‘S’’ sheet which connects the front and back sheets . 25 , 28 The overall quaternary structure of UE - I ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) is that of the most commonly occurring legume lectin dimer . 25 The six - stranded anti - parallel back sheet of each monomeric subunit form a 12 - stranded anti - parallel b - sheet scaffold in the dimeric molecule . Upon this scaffold , the front and S - sheets of the monomeric subunits are located with the carbohydrate binding sites present at both ends of the dimer . Both subunits of the UE - I dimer are seen to have the expected legume lectin fold , with some noticeable differences ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . The six - stranded back sheet is present , consisting of residues Asp3 to Phe8 , Asn231 to Thr237 , Ala66 to Ser73 , Ala169 to Tyr175 , Thr181 to Thr187 , and Thr193 to Ser199 . The seven - stranded front sheet consists of residues Asp17 to Gly22 , Thr45 to Tyr51 , Val213 to Thr219 , Asp87 to Ala94 , Thr122 to Thr129 , His143 to Asn149 , and Ile154 to Arg158 . The ﬁve - stranded S sheet 25 is a four - stranded sheet in the UE - I structure ( highlighted in Figure 2 ( b ) ) , comprised of residues Phe74 to Gln77 , Glu224 to Leu230 , Val31 to Val37 , and Asn23 to Ile27 . A second difference between the UE - I structure and that of the conventional legume lectin subunit is the presence of a b - strand connecting the front and back sheets in each subunit . This strand , comprised of residues Arg158 to Gly164 , is an extension of the seventh strand of the front sheet , and connects to the fourth strand of the back sheet . Also , the amino acid Ala of the Ala - Asp cis - peptide bond seen in the binding site of many lectins for carbo - hydrate recognition 25 is a Thr in UE - I . Finally , the presence of a disulﬁde bridge ( between residues 115 and 150 ) in UE - I is novel for the legume lectin . N - linked carbohydrate Covalently attached oligosaccharides were found at Asn23 and Asn111 of subunit A ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . At position 23 on subunit A , a heptasaccharide commonly found in plant lectins , 34 namely a - D - Man - ( 1 3 ) - [ a - D - Man - ( 1 ! 6 ) ] - [ b - D - Xyl - ( 1 ! 2 ) ] - b - D - Man - ( 1 ! 4 ) - b - D - GlcNAc - ( 1 ! 4 ) - [ a - L - Fuc - ( 1 ! 3 ) ] - D - GlcNAc , could be ﬁtted into electron density which stretched across a solvent channel to interact with a symmetry - related molecule . In the case of subunit B , some electron density for N - linked oligo - saccharide was detected at Asn23 ; however , the Figure 2 . The structure of UE - I .

Figures 2 through 5 were produced using the program SETOR . 62 426 Ulex europaeus Lectin I electron density was not sufﬁciently resolved to allow for modeling of a GlcNAc residue . A trisaccharide , a - L - Fuc - ( 1 ! 3 ) - b - D - GlcNAc - ( 1 ! 4 ) - D - GlcNAc , could be ﬁtted into electron density at Asn111 of both subunits . The average B - factors for the attached oligosaccharides were quite high ; 59 . 7 A˚ 2 for subunit A and 77 . 6 A˚ 2 for subunit B . The carbohydrate - binding site Though leguminous lectins exhibit both sequence and structural similarities , their carbo - hydrate binding speciﬁcities differ widely . With regards to carbohydrate speciﬁcity , the legume lec - tins are separated into ﬁve classes based upon the monosaccharide which exhibits the highest binding afﬁnity , even though the binding of the monosac - charide is much weaker than that of the complete carbohydrate moiety recognized by the lectin . These classes are : Glc / Man ; Gal / GalNAc ; Fuc ; chitobiose ( GlcNAc ) ; and Complex , in which the lectin is speciﬁc for a complex oligosaccharide rather than a single monosaccharide moiety . X - ray crystallographic analysis of lectins from the Glc / Man , Gal / GalNAc and complex speciﬁcities encompass the majority of knowledge about lectins and their interactions with carbohydrate to date . 25 Recently , the quaternary structure of the second lectin from U . europaeus ( UE - II ) has been reported . 31 UE - II is a chitobiose - speciﬁc lectin , and a detailed X - ray analysis should shed light into the nature of its carbohydrate speciﬁcity . Very little structural information is known about the fucose - speciﬁc lectins , though the molecular modeling of UE - I has been reported . 35 Although the isolation of a second a - L - fucose - speciﬁc legume lectin has been reported , the lectin from Lotus tetragonolobus , 36 - 38 to date the X - ray structure of a fucose - speciﬁc legume lectin has not been available . Konami et al . 39 found that the peptide Asp128 to Trp137 of UE - I was retained on a Fuc - Gel afﬁnity column and concluded that these residues consti - tute the carbohydrate binding site . Other legume lectin - carbohydrate complexes 25 , 40 , 41 indicate that residues homologous with Asp87 , Asn135 and Gly104 of UE - I form hydrogen bonds with sugars . Residues involved in carbohydrate binding in the GS - IV lectin are Arg48 , Ser49 , Asp89 , Tyr105 , Gly106 , Gly107 , Phe108 , His114 , Asn135 , Trp138 , Tyr223 . 20 Figure 3 , showing the carbohydrate bind - ing site of GS - IV superimposed upon that of UE - I using the program LSQKAB of the CCP4 42 suite of programs , illustrates the homology between the binding sites of both lectins . The UE - I binding site is therefore taken to be a depression made up of residues Glu44 , Thr86 , Asp87 , Gly104 - Gly105 , Ile130 , Val134 , Asn135 , Trp137 , Tyr220 , and Arg223 . The binding of R - MPD A molecule of the crystallization precipitant , R - 2 - methyl - 2 , 4 - pentanediol ( R - MPD ) , was found to occupy a binding site in each subunit of UE - I . This observation proved to be of great assistance in the docking of the H - type 2 - OMe , especially since the structure of the epitope was known . 17 The binding of R - MPD by UE - I is very weak ( D . R . Bundle , per - sonel communication ) , and is a result of the large excess of the racemic diol being present during crystallization . Hydrogen bonds were observed between O2 of R - MPD and Glu44 OE1 , O2 of R - MPD and Gly105 N , O4 of R - MPD and Gly105 N , and O4 of R - MPD and Asn135 ND2 and OD1 . There are also distances of < 4 . 1 A˚ between non - hydrogen atoms of R - MPD and non - hydrogen atoms of residues Thr86 , Gly104 , Val134 , Asn135 , Trp137 , and Tyr220 of UE - I . Figure 3 . Overlay of the carbohydrate binding sites of UE - I ( red ) and the GS - IV lectin ( green ) . The letters U and G in residue labels denote UE - I and GS - IV , respectively . Ulex europaeus Lectin I 427 Cis - peptide bonds of the binding site There are two cis - peptide bonds within the UE - I structure , and both are involved in the carbo - hydrate binding of UE - I . These two cis - peptide bonds are between residues Thr86 and Asp87 and between residues Ser132 and Pro133 . The Thr86 - Asp87 cis - peptide bond is analogous to the Ala - Asp cis - peptide bond observed in other lectin structures . 25 This cis - peptide is present in order to position the side - chain of the aspartate residue in the binding site of the protein . It is possible that the hydroxyl group of the Thr86 side - chain is also involved in carbohydrate binding . In the present structure , the hydroxyl group of the Thr86 side - chain points away from the carbohydrate binding site and hydrogen bonds with the Asp87 side - chain . If this group is indeed involved in carbo - hydrate binding , it would require a rotation about the C a - C b bond to position it within the binding site ; however , in the present structure , this rotation about the Thr86 C a - C b bond is not in agreement with the observed electron density . The second cis - peptide bond in the UE - I structure involves proline , more commonly observed in protein structures , and is between Ser132 and Pro133 . This cis - peptide bond positions Val134 into the carbo - hydrate - binding site , and therefore contributes to the hydrophobic nature of the binding site . Calcium and manganese ions Positively charged metal ions form part of a building unit in legume lectins . Both a calcium ion and a transition metal ion , generally manganese , are present and are adjacent to the binding site . The presence of these ions is considered to help lock the tertiary structure of the lectin into a favor - able conformation for carbohydrate binding . As previously suggested by Delbaere et al . , 43 the posi - tive charges may induce electron delocalization favorable to the stability of the complex . Both a cal - cium and manganese ion are present in each sub - unit of UE - I ( Figure 4 ) . The manganese ion is in a octahedral coordination ; as is commonly found in proteins , 44 the calcium ion is coordinated by seven oxygen atoms in a pentagonal bipyramidal con - ﬁguration . The ions are 4 . 17 A˚ apart and are 7 . 8 A˚ ( Ca 2 (cid:135) ) and 11 . 6 A˚ ( Mn 2 (cid:135) ) from the carbohydrate binding site , using C3 of R - MPD as an approxi - mate center of the binding site . The comparison of the UE - I structure to the previously predicted model Gohier and co - workers 35 predicted the structure of the UE - I binding site by sequence alignment of several lectins with the published sequence of Konami et al . 15 and a structural superposition of previously determined lectin structures . In order to compare the previously predicted and actual observed binding sites , the previously modeled UE - I was superimposed onto the binding site of the present structure using the program LSQKAB of the CCP4 42 suite . The Asp87 , Ile130 and Tyr220 residues were observed to be in similar locations in both structures . The Phe136 residue of the pre - viously predicted UE - I structure was located in a position equivalent to that occupied by Trp137 , previously sequenced as an aspartate . 15 Also , the location of the Ser132 side - chain was observed to be very different between the two structures . These differences can mainly be attributed to anomalies between the previously published primary sequence of UE - I 15 and the observed electron density . The docking of H - type 2 - OMe into the carbohydrate - binding site of UE - I Studies into the interactions involved in the speciﬁcity of carbohydrate recognition by lectins have been greatly assisted by the development of methodologies for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharides . 16 The ability to chemically syn - thesize complex oligosaccharides provided access to congeners such as all the monodeoxy and mono - O - methyl derivatives . By determining the effects Figure 4 . Stereographic representation of the carbohydrate - binding site and metal ion coordination in the UE - I subunit . Main - chain atoms are in gray , the calcium ion in green , the manganese ion in yellow , the R - MPD molecule in goldenrod , water molecules are in red , and side - chains involved in carbohydrate binding and / or ion coordination are in purple . Amino acid residues and water molecules involved in metal ion coordination are labeled . 428 Ulex europaeus Lectin I of these slight structural changes on binding , a chemical map of the epitope , that is the groups which interact between the two molecules upon complexation , can be predicted . 19 It is known that UE - I speciﬁcally binds the H - type 2 blood group determinant [ a - L - Fuc a ( 1 ! 2 ) - b - D - Gal b ( 1 ! 4 ) - b - D - GlcNAc a - ] . Therefore , when both the deoxygenation and the O - methyl - ation of the H - type 2 - OMe essentially abolish bind - ing ( Table 1 ) , the conclusion can be made that these hydroxyl groups provide critical hydrogen bonds with the protein . Also , when deoxygenation signiﬁcantly decreases binding but the O - methyl - ation causes little change in ( and on occasion strengthens ) binding , the indication is taken that the parent hydroxyl group resides at the periphery of the binding site in the complex where it will interact with peripheral amino acid residues . Finally , when small changes in binding are seen as a result of the structural modiﬁcations , it may be interpreted as arising from changes in hydration of polar groups which remain in the aqueous phase . Noting the above interpretations , a chemical map of the H - type 2 - OMe ( Figure 1 ) can be pre - dicted . The inhibitory studies 17 indicate that the three hydroxyls ( O2c , O3c , O4c ) of the a - L - Fuc unit provide critical hydrogen bonds to UE - I , the 3b - hydroxyl group of the b - D - Gal unit is interacting at the periphery of the UE - I binding site , and that the 3a - hydroxyl group of the b - D - GlcNAc unit remains within the aqueous phase . In addition to these polar interactions , replacement of the 6a - OH group of the b - D - GlcNAc moiety by a hydrogen atom more than doubled the binding potency , indicating a hydrophobic interaction . Also , the hydrophobic C - 5 - CH 3 of the fucose is close enough to be a part of this hydrophobic region , and its replacement by hydrogen has a signiﬁcant deleterious effect on binding ( Table 1 ) . 13 It should be noted , however , that the replacement of the methyl group by a hydrogen atom may have a profound effect on the conformational preference of a building unit that provides three key hydroxyl groups to the binding region . In order to examine the interactions between UE - I and the H - type 2 blood group determinant , the H - type 2 - OMe was docked into the UE - I carbo - hydrate binding site and energy minimization was performed . It has been established that chemical alterations of the oligosaccharide cause no signiﬁ - cant change in the conformational preference . 17 It has also been shown that in the crystal structures of several complexes of Le b - OMe congeners with GS - IV , the occupancies of the congeners were found to be identical to that of the parent Le b - OMe ( M . Vandonselaar , personal communication ) . Therefore , the model used for the present studies was provided by the chemical map of H - type 2 - OMe predicted from the inhibitory studies , with coordinates obtained from hard sphere exo - anomeric ( HSEA ) calculations . 45 Several potential hydrogen bonds and potential van der Waals inter - actions between the H - type 2 - OMe and the binding site of UE - I were found in the model of the complex ( Figure 5 ) . The potential hydrogen bonding pattern of the fucopyranose unit of the modeled H - type 2 - OMe would explain the inhibitory studies into the bind - ing of the H - type 2 - OMe by UE - I . 13 , 17 All three hydroxyl groups of the fucopyranose unit are within the binding site and provide potentially critical hydrogen bonds with the protein ; O3c and O4c hydroxyls would provide direct hydrogen bonds to the protein , while O2c is likely involved in a water - bridged interaction with UE - I . Disrup - tion of these potential hydrogen bonds by altera - tion of these hydroxyl groups would lead to greatly diminished or abolished binding . The side - chains of Val134 , Trp137 and Tyr220 in the binding site of UE - I form a surface which helps to surround the polar interactions of the key hydroxyl groups . Figure 5 . Stereographic representation of the docked H - type 2 - OMe within the carbohydrate - binding site . All three hydroxyls of the fucopyranose unit are deep within the binding site and potentially provide critical interactions with UE - I . O3c and O4c would provide direct hydrogen bonds to G105 - N and N135 - ND2 . O2c likely interacts with Asp87 - OD2 and Asn135 - OD1 through a bridging water molecule . The H - type 2 - OMe is in green , main - chain atoms in gray , binding site residues in red . Hydrogen bonds between the H - type 2 - OMe and binding site are represented as dark gray broken lines . Ser132 , previously thought to be present in the binding site , 35 is in yellow . Ulex europaeus Lectin I 429 An ordered water structure in the combining site of lectins is thought to be required for carbo - hydrate binding . 46 - 49 This knowledge , as well as the unusually high entropy barrier to H - type 2 - OMe binding by UE - I ( T (cid:1) S (cid:136) (cid:255) 20 . 5 kcal / mol ) , allows for the inference that ordered water mol - ecules will be present within the UE - I - binding site and interact with both the protein and the bound H - type 2 trisaccharide . The ordered water mol - ecules are expected to be liberated upon complex formation and thus contribute signiﬁcantly to the high enthalpy of binding ( (cid:255) 29 kcal / mol ) . The term ‘‘hydraphobic effect’’ has been proposed 48 to ident - ify this water - related contribution to the binding of strongly hydrophilic surfaces in the presence of very large molar excesses of water , such as found at the surface of proteins . No ordered water molecules are seen in the carbohydrate - binding site of the present structure . It is believed that the bound R - MPD molecule is sufﬁciently hydrophobic in nature to extrude water from the binding site . It is likely that the O2c hydroxyl of the fucopyranosyl moiety of the H - type 2 - OMe hydrogen bonds to the protein through ordered water molecules within the bind - ing site . This potential water bridging is seen by the interatomic distances between O2c and Asp87 O d 2 ( 3 . 87 A˚ ) , and between O2c and Asn135 O d 1 ( 3 . 94 A˚ ) and N d 2 ( 3 . 98 A˚ ) of UE - I . Other possible water - mediated interactions are observed between O4c and Glu44 O e 1 ( 3 . 91 A˚ ) , O5c and Tyr220 OH ( 4 . 34 A˚ ) , and between O3b and Arg223 N e ( 3 . 85 A˚ ) and Arg223 NH2 ( 3 . 88 A˚ ) . Materials and Methods Ulex europaeus lectin I was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim ( lot # 13178220 - 07 ) in pure form , and no further puriﬁcation was performed . Crystals were grown by a sitting drop vapor diffusion technique in which 20 m l drops consisting of 5 mg / ml protein , 0 . 05 mM cal - cium chloride , 0 . 05 mM manganese chloride , 22 . 5 % R , S - 2 - methyl - 2 , 4 - pentanediol ( R , S - MPD ) , and 0 . 05 M sodium acetate buffer ( pH 4 . 0 ) were placed in sitting drop rods and equilibrated over reservoirs containing 45 % R , S - MPD , 0 . 1 M sodium acetate buffer ( pH 4 . 0 ) for one week . Washed seed crystals were then introduced into the protein drops and equilibration was continued until the seed crystals stopped growing ( 5 - 6 months ) . The crystals are in the monoclinic space group C 2 , with unit cell dimensions a (cid:136) 79 . 61 A˚ , b (cid:136) 70 . 67 A˚ , c (cid:136) 122 . 15 A˚ , and b (cid:136) 108 . 6 (cid:14) . This technique is a modiﬁcation of the one originally published . 21 Data from three crystals were collected on an Enraf Nonius FAST area detector . The X - ray source was an FR571 rotating anode generator operated at 45 kV , 95 mA , with copper radiation and a graphite monochroma - tor . The data from two crystals were merged to produce a data set which was 96 . 9 % complete to 2 . 8 A˚ resolution . A summary of the diffraction data is given in Table 2 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using as a starting model the G . simplicifolia lectin IV coordinates ( PDB accession code 1LEC ) 20 edited to remove all side - chains which were not homologous in the two sequences . The program AMoRe from the CCP4 suite 42 , 50 was used for the molecular replacement search . The rotation search , carried out with data in the 10 - 4 A˚ resolution range , produced two major peaks , 9 s and 7 s above background . A translation search on the ﬁrst peak alone yielded a solution with a correlation coefﬁcient 0 . 314 and R - value 0 . 526 . A translation search for the second rotation peak was then carried out with the ﬁrst peak ﬁxed . The correlation coefﬁcient for the two peaks together was 0 . 436 and the R - value was 0 . 490 . An AMoRe rigid body reﬁnement resulted in a solution with correlation coefﬁcient 0 . 596 and R - value 0 . 452 . The pro - gram LSQKAB from the CCP4 42 suite was used to apply the two rotational and translational solutions to the orig - inal model coordinates . The resulting model turned out to be the 12 - stranded beta - sheet dimer found in several other legume lectins 25 and was therefore accepted as the correct molecular replacement solution . X - PLOR 50 , 51 rigid body reﬁnement did not improve the R - value but gave a more interpretable 2 F O (cid:255) F C map than the one calculated from the AMoRe model . The X - PLOR map and a SIGMAA 53 , 54 map were used to begin manual rebuilding of the model with TURBO - FRODO . 55 Manual ﬁtting was applied to only one subunit ; the other was generated using a matrix found by superimposing one subunit onto the other , cal - culated with the LSQKAB program using coordinates from X - PLOR rigid body reﬁnement . New 3 F O (cid:255) 2 F C , SIGMAA , and non - crystallographic symmetry ( NCS ) averaged maps were calculated using programs in the CCP4 package . Three rounds of manual model building , alternated with new map calculations , resulted in a model which had 219 correct side - chains built into the electron density . At this stage , the model was subjected to X - PLOR simulated annealing reﬁnement consisting of a slow - cooling step from an initial temperature of 4000 K to a ﬁnal temperature of 300 K using steps of 50 K with a time step of 0 . 2 fs . This was followed by 120 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization and individual B - factor reﬁnement . Coordinates of only one subunit were given and strict NCS symmetry was imposed using the reﬁned matrix from the NCS - averaged program DM . 63 A ran - domly selected test set of 10 % of the reﬂections in the 10 - 2 . 8 A˚ range was excluded from the reﬁnement to evaluate R Free56 After further modeling , the resolution was extended to 2 . 2 A˚ by reﬁning with data from a third crystal . Simulated annealing with strict NCS symmetry gave an R Free of 0 . 415 and R - value of 0 . 350 . Simulated annealing of the dimer with NCS restraints gave an R Free of 0 . 331 and R - value of 0 . 284 . In subsequent cycles of manual ﬁtting , each subunit was rebuilt individually and NCS restraints were no longer used in reﬁnement . Three more rounds of model building and simulated annealing reﬁnement were carried out , during which covalently linked carbohydrate , solvent ( water ) mol - ecules , and one molecule of the precipitant , R - 2 - methyl - 2 , 4 - pentanediol ( R - MPD ) seen to be present within each binding site ( one R - MPD molecule per subunit ) , were added to the model . The program ARP 57 was used to locate water molecules in 3 F O (cid:255) 2 F C and 2 F O (cid:255) F C elec - tron density maps . Near the end of the model building process , only X - PLOR positional reﬁnement was carried out . The bond and angle parameters , reported by Engh & Huber 58 were employed throughout the reﬁnement . The ﬁnal R free and R - value were 0 . 242 and 0 . 185 , respect - ively , using reﬂections in the 10 . 0 - 2 . 2 A˚ range . A ﬁnal reﬁnement which included all data and a bulk solvent correction gave an R - value of 0 . 171 and an R Free of 0 . 217 . Examination of interactions between the ﬁnal model and 430 Ulex europaeus Lectin I symmetry - related molecules within the crystal was performed using the program CONTACSYM . 59 , 60 A summary of the ﬁnal reﬁnement statistics is shown in Table 2 . Modeling of the H - type 2 - OMe into the UE - I - binding site proceeded in the following fashion . Coordinates for the b - methyl glycoside of the H - type 2 trisaccharide ( H - type 2 - OMe ) molecule were obtained from hard sphere exo - anomeric ( HSEA ) calculations . 45 The H - type 2 - OMe was manually docked into the UE - I - binding site using TURBO - FRODO . The ﬁrst monomer of the UE - I dimer was used in modeling studies due to its lower B - factors in the structure . O4 of the a - L - fucose moiety was overlaid onto O2 of the R - MPD molecule , and the remainder of the H - type 2 - OMe was modeled into the binding site making the most favorable contacts . The protein ( minus R - MPD ) and docked carbohydrate were then subjected to 600 cycles of conjugant gradient mini - mization using X - PLOR . During this minimization , the X - ray term was turned off . Examination of the ﬁnal docked / minimized structure was performed using TURBO - FRODO , and interactions between UE - I and the H - type 2 - OMe were identiﬁed using the program CONTACSYM and manual inspection using TURBO - FRODO .
