l e t t e r s WAVE and Arp2 / 3 jointly inhibit filopodium formation by entering into a complex with mDia2 Petra Beli 1 , 2 , Debora Mascheroni 1 , 2 , Dalu Xu 1 , 2 , Metello Innocenti 1 , 3 lamellipodia / ruffles and filopodia are protruding organelles containing short and highly branched or long and unbranched actin filaments , respectively 1 – 3 . the microscopic morphology , dynamic development and protein signature of both lamellipodia / ruffles and filopodia have been investigated 2 , 3 ; however , little is known about the mechanisms by which cells coordinate the formation of these actin - based extensions . Here , we show that WAVe holds mDia2 and the Arp2 / 3 complex in a multimolecular complex . WAVe - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent ruffling induced by eGF does not require mDia2 . Conversely , the emission of mDia2 - dependent filopodia correlates with its disengagement from WAVe . Consistently , the ability of eGF , Cdc42 and serum to induce mDia2 - dependent formation of filopodia is increased in the absence of either the WAVe / Abi1 / Nap1 / PIr121 ( WANP ) or the Arp2 / 3 complex . reintroduction of WAVe2 into WANP - complex knockdown cells markedly reduces filopodia formation independently of actin polymerization . thus , WAVe and the Arp2 / 3 complex jointly orchestrate different types of actin - based plasma membrane protrusions by promoting ruffling and inhibiting mDia2 - induced filopodia . De novo actin polymerization is required for the formation of both lamellipodia / ruffles and filopodia , and provides the mechanical force pushing the plasma membrane forward 4 . The Arp2 / 3 complex and formins , including the diaphanous - related formins ( Drfs ) , function as actin - nucleation catalysts in overcoming the rate - limiting formation of actin dimers and trimers in vivo . The Arp2 / 3 complex is composed of the actin - related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 and five additional subunits ( p41 ARPC1 , p34 ARPC2 , p21 ARPC3 , p20 ARPC4 and p16 ARPC5 ; ref . 5 ) and has weak basal nucleation activity . The WAVE / WASP family of nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) and the side of pre - existing actin filaments synergistically activate the Arp2 / 3 complex 6 . Autocatalytic Arp2 / 3 - complex - dependent actin polymerization initiates the dendritic network observed within lamellipodia / ruffles 7 . On the other hand , Drf proteins may be locked in an autoinhibited conformation through an interaction involving their GTPase - binding and diaphanous autoin - hibitory domains ( GBD and DAD , respectively ) . Increased DAD lev - els disrupt this association by direct competition and activate Drfs in a constitutive and GTPase - unresponsive manner 8 . Active Drfs are thought to behave like a barbed - end cap and to stabilize the formation of an adjacent actin dimer 9 , 10 . The ‘leaky’ capping activity of Drfs allows this nascent filament to elongate from its barbed end 11 , 12 . Linear actin fila - ments , such as those of filopodia and of stress fibres , are produced by Drf - dependent nucleation 11 . The pivotal contribution of lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions to important biological processes , such as cell migration , invasion , wound healing and neuronal pathfinding , requires that the activity of different actin nucleators is tightly controlled . In this regard , Rho GTPase - and receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) - dependent pathways have an important role . Rho and Cdc42 modulate the actin cytoskeleton also through Drfs 13 and Rac controls the Arp2 / 3 complex through a physical interaction with the WANP complex 14 . The integrity of the Rac – WANP – Arp2 / 3 pathway is essential for both RTK - and Rac - induced ruffling 14 – 17 . Although these activities are integrated into a net - work determining the coordinated or selective emission of lamellipodia / ruffles and filopodia , little is known about the nature of these regulatory events . In this study , starting from the observation that mDia2 , WAVE and the Arp2 / 3 complex form a multimolecular complex , we uncov - ered a new mechanism through which the actin cytoskeleton undergoes structural rearrangements generating filopodia . Increasing evidence indicates that mDia2 is involved in filopodia formation 13 , 18 , whereas the essential contribution of the WANP – Arp2 / 3 cassette to ruffling has been established 14 , 17 , 19 . An interaction between mDia2 and either the WANP or Arp2 / 3 complex could efficiently orchestrate the emission of filopodia and ruffles . Indeed , immunopre - cipitation studies showed that mDia2 , but not mDia1 , interacts in an EGF - insensitive manner with WAVE in HeLa cells ( Fig . 1a ) . Moreover , an mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 multimolecular complex was detectable in vivo , and endogenous WAVE and mDia2 were recovered as Arp2 - co - precipitating proteins ( Fig . 1b ) . Very low overexpression of Myc - tagged mDia2 was used to circumvent the lack of antibodies able to immunoprecipitate endogenous mDia2 , and to mimic physiological 1 Institute of Biochemistry II , Goethe University Medical School , Theodor - Stern - Kai 7 , 60590 Frankfurt , Germany . 2 These authors contributed equally to this work . 3 Correspondence should be addressed to M .

The surfaces deter - mining the mDia2 – WAVE2 interaction were also identified ( Fig . 1f – g ) . The amino - and carboxy - terminal regions of mDia2 , the Scar homology domain ( SHD ) and proline - rich ( P - rich ) - region of WAVE2 are likely to represent low - affinity binding regions contributing to the forma - tion of the mDia2 – WAVE2 complex , which has a dissociation constant of 0 . 4 µ M ( Fig . 1h ) . Alternatively , a surface accessible to WAVE2 only when mDia2 is autoinhibited could account for these observations .

To investigate whether mDia2 is involved in ruffle formation , an RNAi - based loss - of - function approach was undertaken . Extensive mem - brane ruffling could be observed in both control and mDia2 knockdown HeLa cells treated with EGF ( Fig . 2a – b ) , demonstrating that mDia2 is not essential for ruffle formation . A partial reduction of WAVE , Nap1 and Abi1 protein levels in mDia2 knockdown cells ( Fig . 2c ) may account for the slightly different ruffle morphology shown by these cells . Silencing of mDia2 also led to a marked increase in cell area independently of the WANP complex ( Fig . 2a , d ) . Importantly , mDia2 downregulation was effective in both wild - type and Nap1 knockdown cells ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary Information , Fig .

Overexpression of Flag - tagged , full - length mDia2 in wild - type HeLa cells did not alter the actin cytoskeleton of serum - starved cells ( data not shown and Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) and EGF - induced ruffles could be readily observed in these cells ( Fig . 2e ) . This response was as efficient as that in untransfected cells ( Fig . 2f ) . Notably , filopo - dial protrusions often developed along with ruffles ( Fig . 2e – f ) . Together , these data indicate that mDia2 neither stimulates nor inhibits WAVE - and Arp2 / 3 - dependent membrane ruffling . Increased mDia2 levels induced filopodial protrusions when EGF was added , raising the question as to how endogenous mDia2 functions . The DAD and FH1 – FH2 fragments of mDia2 were used to gain insight into the molecular mechanism regulating mDia2 activity . DAD1041 , a mutant lacking GBD - binding ability 8 , was used as a control . The results collectively suggest that DAD overexpression is sufficient to activate Drfs and trigger formation of stress fibres but not filopodia ( Supplementary Information , Figs S1d , S2 ) . Therefore , one or more factors could repress mDia2 - induced filopodia . Instead , the FH1 – FH2 module of mDia2 induced both actin - based structures , being endowed with constitutive activity that is insensitive to those inhibitory factors ( Supplementary Information , Figs S1e , S2 ) . In this model , an increase in mDia2 - protein levels should be sufficient to titrate out inhibitors acting in trans , but not in cis , and to unleash filopodia after conversion to the active confor - mation . The ectopic expression of Flag – mDia2 induced filopodial pro - trusions accompanied by ruffles only when EGF was added ( Fig . 2e – f ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) , suggesting that filopodia are actively suppressed and not simply embedded in ruffles . Serum triggered Cdc42 activation ( Fig . 3a ) and induced formation of prominent filopodia in wild - type HeLa cells ( Fig . 3b ) , as previously reported for other cell types 21 , 22 . mDia2 knockdown almost completely abolished serum - induced filopodia , demonstrating that mDia2 has an essential role in this response ( Fig . 3b – c ) . Interestingly , the amount of mDia2 co - immunoprecipitating with WAVE , which holds mDia2 and the Arp2 / 3 complex together , was diminished after serum stimulation ( Fig . 3d – e ) . The reciprocal experiment gave similar results ( Fig . 3f ) . Overexpression of constitutively active Cdc42 was also used to trig - ger filopodia formation 1 . Silencing of mDia2 reduced the ability of activated Cdc42 to induce filopodia ( Fig . 3b – c ) . Moreover , Cdc42QL - induced formation of filopodia was accompanied by a decrease in the mDia2 – WAVE interaction ( Fig . 3d – e ) . Therefore , the outgrowth of mDia2 - dependent filopodia correlates with disassembly of the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex . These observations suggest that the dynamics of the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex control filopodia formation by regulating mDia2 activ - ity . The integrity of both WANP and Arp2 / 3 complexes is required for stability of their subunits 14 , 17 , 23 . Hence , RNAi was used to artificially perturb the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex . Silencing of Nap1 led to degradation of all the other components in the WANP complex 16 ( data not shown ) , and downregulation of Arp3 , but not p21 ARPC3 , destabi - lized the other Arp2 / 3 - complex subunits ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a – b ) . Serum - starved knockdown cells showed no major alterations in the actin cytoskeleton ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3c ) . When stimulated with EGF , control HeLa cells underwent ruffling ( Fig . 4a – b ) , as expected . Ruffles were absent in Nap1 knockdown cells stimulated with EGF , but protrusions resembling filopodia could readily be observed ( Fig . 4a – c ) . Downregulation of either p21 ARPC3 in wild - type HeLa cells ( Fig . 4a – c ) or WAVE1 in WAVE2 knockdown HeLa cells also gave rise to filopodia but not ruffles ( data not shown ) . Moreover , RNAi of Arp3 , p21 ARPC3 , either alone or in combination , resulted in EGF - induced finger - like extensions rather than ruffles ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3d – e ) . Knockdown of p21 ARPC3 also had similar effects on Cos - 7 and U2OS cells ( data not shown ) . Thus , downregulation of either the WANP - complex or Arp2 / 3 - complex subunits produces the same phe - notype . In Nap1 knockdown cells EGF induced finger - like and motile protrusions growing by extension ( Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) . Furthermore , endogenous VASP and Fascin , two molecular markers of genuine filopodia 3 , 24 , decorated the tip and the stalk , respectively , of some of these structures ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) . Hence , EGF elicits bona fide filopodia in cells where the WANP complex is absent . Notably , removal of mDia2 in Nap1 knockdown cells markedly decreased EGF - induced formation of filopodia ( Fig . 4d – e ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c – d ) , demonstrating that mDia2 has a fundamental role in this effect . Pre - treatment with the actin - depolymerizing drug latrunculin A before EGF stimulation completely inhibited filopodia formation ( data not shown ) , indicating that de novo actin polymerization is involved . Taken together , these data suggest that both the WANP and the Arp2 / 3 complexes are essential for inhibiting EGF - induced filopodia formation by mDia2 . We also compared the effects of Cdc42QL overexpression and serum stimulation ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5a , b , respectively ) in wild - type and Nap1 knockdown cells . Both filopodium - inducing agents were more efficient in Nap1 knockdown than in wild - type HeLa cells ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5c – d ) , as expected if WAVE were inhibiting mDia2 activity . In agreement with the data obtained in wild - type cells , RNAi of mDia2 decreased serum - and Cdc42QL - induced filopodia by 82 and 48 % , respectively ( data not shown ) . Together , these findings confirm that the filopodium - promoting activity of mDia2 is unmasked when the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex is disrupted . WAVE2 expression was restored in Nap1 knockdown cells to assess whether the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex suppresses the filopo - dium - promoting activity of mDia2 , or whether ruffles mask filopo - dia . Among the WANP - complex subunits , only WAVE2 significantly reduced EGF - induced filopodia formation ( Fig . 5a – b ) , although it did not rescue ruffling ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S6a ) . Many of the WAVE2 transfectants ( 58 % ) showed non - apoptotic actin - rich blebs ( Fig . 5a and data not shown ) , whereas the rest did not undergo any rear - rangement ( data not shown ) . Similar results were obtained with Flag - tagged WAVE2 ∆ VPH ( Fig . 5b – c ) , which binds to but does not activate the Arp2 / 3 complex or induce actin polymerization 25 ( data not shown ) . Importantly , WAVE2 - induced blebbing required mDia2 ( Fig . 5d – e ) . A similar phenotype was observed with overexpression of DIP ( Dia - interacting protein ) 26 or DAD in Nap1 knockdown cells ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S6b – c ) , suggesting that blebbing is linked to perturbed mDia2 activity . WAVE2 mutants retaining only the Arp2 / 3 - complex - activating ( WAVE2 ∆ P , VCA ) or mDia2 - binding ( WAVE2 ∆ CA ) capabil - ity ( Fig . 5f ) did not exert any effect ( Fig . 5a – b ) . These data indicate that the filopodium - inhibiting action of WAVE2 correlates with its scaffold - ing of the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex . Most importantly , WAVE2 - mediated suppression of filopodia in the absence of ruffling is consistent with the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex actively inhibiting mDia2 . The present study shows that WAVE and Arp2 / 3 jointly inhibit filo - podia formation by entering into a complex with mDia2 .

All rights reserved . l E t t E r s of filopodia and lamellipodia / ruffles requires distinct actin - nucleating machineries involving mDia2 and the Arp2 / 3 complex , respectively . Nevertheless , filopodia do not arise independently of the ruffle - making machinery . Indeed , WAVE and the Arp2 / 3 complex are both essential in maintaining inhibition of the filopodium - promoting activity of mDia2 . Interestingly , mDia2 inhibition does not require the NPF activity of WAVE . Formation of filopodia by mDia2 correlates with Cdc42 activa - tion and mDia2 dissociation from WAVE . Taken together , these observations reveal a previously unknown negative role of WAVE and the Arp2 / 3 complex in filopodium forma - tion . Thus , WAVE and the Arp2 / 3 complex fulfil both positive and negative functions in actin dynamics by promoting ruffling and , at the same time , repressing filopodia . Similar filopodium formation was observed when Cdc42L61 and RacN17 were co - transfected into either control , WANP - or Arp2 / 3 - complex knockdown fibroblasts 23 . This is not surprising as blockade of Rac - downstream pathways inhibits ruf - fling , increases Cdc42 activity and causes the formation of mDia2 - dependent and independent filopodia - like protrusions when EGF is added ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S6d – f ) . In this regard , it is important that filopodia induction by Cdc42QL was more effective in the absence of the WANP complex ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S5 ) . Recently , Yang et al . also showed that mDia2 is important for filopodia formation , but observed different effects of the WAVE - based complex . Their model for filopodia initiation postulates that the Arp2 / 3 and WANP complexes have a positive role 3 , 27 . The Arp2 / 3 complex is thought to provide a source of actin filaments to be rear - ranged into bundles , whereas the WANP complex is thought to control mDia2 localization . This function of the Arp2 / 3 complex was inferred from morphological studies whose conclusions have already been chal - lenged 23 . Intertwining between filopodial and lamellipodial filaments after mDia2 - dependent filopodium generation is equally possible and produces the same phenotypes . Yang and co - workers concluded that Abi1 is required for mDia2 - dependent filopodia formation as Abi1 knockdown cells have fewer filopodia per cell , compared with control cells . However , in their study , not only was there a marked decrease in mDia2 protein in Abi1 knockdown cells to a similar level as that in mDia2 knockdown cells , but filopodia number and length were increased in Abi1 , compared with mDia2 knockdown cells 27 . Thus , mDia2 activity is likely to be upregulated in their Abi1 knockdown cells . Notably , we did not observe any significant change in mDia2 expression when either Nap1 ( Supplementary information , Fig . S1c ) or Abi1 ( data not shown ) were downregulated . Both subunit availability and proficiency to assemble could affect the dynamics of the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 nano - machine at filo - podia . Actually , the Arp2 / 3 complex is excluded from filopodial projections in several cell types 28 , supporting the findings presented herein . Additional components are certainly required to achieve spatial segregation and locally controlled assembly of the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 - complex subunits . Therefore , other proteins are likely to belong to the mDia2 – WAVE – Arp2 / 3 complex and regulate mDia2 activity through either modality . Our results suggest that inhibition of mDia2 activity inside growing filopodia should occur through dif - ferent mechanisms . DIP , which interacts only with activated mDia2 and mediates filopodium inhibition independently of Arp3 ( ref . 26 ) , could contribute to terminating filopodium elongation in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex . Whatever the case , the ability of the ruffle - making machinery to gov - ern filopodial protrusions by controlling mDia2 activity represents a biologically economical and rapid means by which live cells adapt to continuous changes of the external environment . MetHODs Expression vectors . Myc - tagged full - length mDia2 , wild - type EGFP – DAD and 1041A were gifts from A . Alberts ( van Andel Institute , Grand Rapids , MI ) 8 . Full - length , FH1 – FH2 ( amino acids 531 – 1033 ) , N - terminal ( amino acids 2 – 530 ) and C - terminal ( amino acids 1034 – 1271 ) mDia2 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pCDNA3 – Flag or pGEX – 6P1 vectors ( GE Healthcare ) . The expres - sion vectors for the WANP - complex subunits , pDs - Red VCA , Myc - tagged and AU5 - tagged Cdc42QL have been described previously 14 . WAVE2 ∆ VPH 25 , WAVE2 ∆ CA and WAVE2 ∆ P , which lacks amino acids 172 – 409 , were obtained from wild - type WAVE2 by using PCR - based mutagenesis . All constructs were sequence - verified . Information on cloning procedures is available in the Supplementary Information , Table S1 . Antibodies and reagents . The following antibodies were used : monoclonal anti - Myc 9E10 and anti - AU5 ( Covance ) , anti - Nap1 ( ref . 14 ) , monoclonal anti - tubulin , anti - vinculin , anti - mDia1 and anti - p21 ARPC3 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , monoclonal and polyclonal anti - Flag , monoclonal anti - Arp2 and anti - actin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , polyclonal anti - WAVE2 , anti - Dia2 , anti - Arp3 , anti - Arp2 , anti - Cdc42 and anti - Abi1 , and monoclonal anti - GST ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , polyclonal anti - p34 ARPC2 ( Imgenex ) , monoclonal anti - Mena , anti - Arp3 , anti - VASP and anti - Fascin ( BD Bioscience ) , polyclonal anti - actin antibodies ( AbCam ) , anti - cleaved - caspase 3 ( New England Biolabs ) . Control anti - goat IgG and all chemicals were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . All antibodies were used according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Biochemical assays . Standard procedures for protein analysis , pull down , in vitro binding , protein purification , cell lysis , immunoprecipitation and CRIB assay were used and have been described previously 14 . For CRIB assays , total cellular lysates ( 500 µ g ) were incubated with GST – CRIB ( GTP - bound Cdc42 or Rac1 ) and a fraction of the input material was kept on ice for the same time ( total , 4 % ) , as described previously 14 . For immunoprecipitation and pull - down studies , if not otherwise stated , 1 mg of total protein lysate was used and 20 µ g of the starting material ( lysate ) was loaded onto the gel . Total cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection , unless otherwise specified . For in vitro binding studies , the input always corresponded to 10 % of the prey . Anti - GST antibodies were used to confirm correct loading in all pull - down experiments ( data not shown ) . Cleavage of full - length mDia2 and WAVE2 from GST was performed with the Pre - scission protease ( GE Healthcare ) according to manu - facturer’s instructions . Purified bovine Arp2 / 3 complex and muscle actin were from Cytoskeleton . Generation of HeLa knockdown cells . Nap1 knockdown cells were obtained by infecting wild - type HeLa cells with pRS – Nap1 ( ref . 17 ) , puromycin selec - tion ( 2 . 5 µ g ml – 1 ) and clonal isolation . Three single clones were selected and further characterized for Nap1 , WANP - complex - subunit protein levels and response to EGF . Similar results were obtained for all three clones and subse - quent experiments were performed with one clone . p21 and Arp3 knockdown cells were obtained with human ARPC3 siGENOME ( or ACTR3 On - Target plus SMARTpool ( Dharmacon ) , respectively . Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) was used to deliver siRNAs into cells . DIAPH3 siGENOME ( duplexes were individually transfected twice into cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions and mDia2 mRNA levels subsequently measured . The two most effective duplexes ( duplex 1 : 5´ - GUAUGCAGCUCAUCAAUGCUU - 3´ ; duplex 2 : 5´ - GUAGACAUUUGCAUAGAUCUU - 3´ ) did not inhibit EGF - induced ruffling but caused similar reductions in filopodia formation in Nap1 knockdown cells and WANP - complex protein levels in wild - type HeLa cells . Subsequent work has been carried out using duplex 1 ( the most effective duplex ) . Initially , parallel sets of cells were transfected with siCONTROL non - targeting siRNA ( Dharmacon ) or mock - transfected to provide essential controls . No differences could be found and thereafter only the latter was performed . mDia2 silencing was always confirmed by immunoblotting and it is morphologically indicated by the increased cell size . WAVE1 - specific siRNA was from Ambion 29 . 856 nature cell biology volume 10 | number 7 | JulY 2008 © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . l E t t E r s Quantitative RT – PCR analysis . Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) from wild - type or Nap1 knockdown HeLa cells transfected either with control - or mDia2 - siRNA duplexes . Total RNA ( 2 µ g ) was used as a template for SuperScript - mediated first - strand cDNA synthesis using random primers , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Drf3 , WAVE2 and Abi1 expression was assessed with the TaqMan assay system ( Applied Biosystems ) . Statistics .

Transfection and immunofluorescence microscopy . Cells seeded on gela - tine - coated coverslips were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using FuGene6 ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After 24 h , cells were processed for epifluorescence or indirect immunofluo - rescence microscopy , as described previously 14 . Control and mDia2 knock - down cells were detached with EDTA to preserve viability and re - plated on gelatin - coated coverslips 24 h before transfection with FuGene6 . 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method : for Fig . 1c , Myc – mDia2 was transfected together with empty vector in a 1 : 10 ratio ( mDia2 ) or with empty vector alone as a control . Unless otherwise indicated , cells were treated with either EGF ( 100 ng ml – 1 ) or serum ( 10 % ) for 7 and 15 min , respectively . Alexa Flour secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) were used . Actin remodelling was monitored as described in the Supplementary Information Methods . Confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510Meta set in the Multi - Track - acquisition mode with a ×63 ( 1 . 4 N . A . ) oil immersion objective .

Wild - type ( wt ) or Nap1 KD ( Nap 1 KD ) HeLa cells were plated on gelatin - coated coverslips and transfected with myc - tagged Cdc42QL . After serum starvation , cells were fixed and stained with phalloidin and anti - myc to detect F - actin or transfected cells , respectively . Representative Z - stack projections are shown . Bar is 10 µ m . ( b ) Phenotypes induced by serum stimulation in wild - type or WANP - complex knockdown cells . Wild - type ( wt ) or Nap1 KD ( Nap 1 KD ) HeLa cells were plated on gelatin - coated coverslips . After serum starvation , cells were stimulated with 10 % FCS and processed to detect F - actin as in a . Representative Z - stack projections are shown . Bar is 10 µ m . ( c ) The filopodium - promoting activity of constitutively active Cdc42 is stronger in Nap1 KD than in wild - type HeLa cells ( + 21 % ) . The analysis of the different phenotypes shown by myc - Cdc42QL - transfected cells in both wild - type and Nap1 KD cells was done as in Fig . 2f . Cdc42QL - induced ruffling was absent in Nap1 KD cells . Less than 5 % of untransfected cells showed filopodia . Ruffles were not detectable in untransfected cells ( not shown ) . Myc - Cdc42QL protein levels and transfection efficiencies were similar in both cell lines ( not shown ) . Similar results were obtained with AU5 - Cdc42QL ( 74 % vs 93 % of filopodium - forming cells , not shown ) . The increased filopodium - forming ability of AU5 - tagged Cdc42QL might be due to its slightly higher expression levels ( not shown ) . ( d ) Filopodia formation by serum is more effective in Nap1 KD than in wild - type HeLa cells ( + 24 % ) . The analysis was performed as in c .

( a ) Reintroduction of either WAVE2 or WAVE2 ∆ VPH into Nap1 KD cells specifically suppresses filopodium formation . Nap1 KD HeLa cells were plated on gelatin - coated coverslips and transfected with single WANP - complex subunits ( myc - PIR121 , EGFP - Abi1 , DS - HSPC300 or Flag - WAVE2 ) or Flag - WAVE2 ∆ VPH . After serum starvation , cells were stimulated with EGF , fixed and stained with phalloidin and , when appropriate , with anti - myc or anti - Flag to identify transfected cells ( not shown and Fig . 5a - c ) . The percentage of cells displaying filopodia upon EGF stimulation was determined for both WANP - complex - subunit - expressing and untransfected ( ctr ) cells . Data in the bar graph are expressed as the mean + / - SEM of three independent experiments in which at least 100 cells for every sample were counted . Transient EGFP expression did not affect the response to EGF ( not shown ) .

Nap1 KD cells were plated on gelatin - coated coverslips and transfected as in Fig . 5a . After serum starvation , cells were stimulated with EGF and fixed . Processing for epifluorescence and staining with phalloidin allowed detection of transfected cells ( EGFP ) or F - actin ( phalloidin ) , respectively . Representative Z - stack projections are shown . Bar is 10 µ m . ( c ) Overexpression of the DAD of mDia2 induces actin - rich blebbing accompanied by filopodia in Nap1 KD cells . Data in the bar graph are expressed as the mean + / - SEM of three independent experiments in which at least 100 cells for every sample were counted . The response of cells transfected with pEGFP - C1 ( not shown ) has been also included as a further control . ( d ) Rac functional inhibition reduces EGF - induced ruffling and causes the formation of filopodia - like protrusions . Control and mDia2 knockdown HeLa cells were obtained as in Fig . 2a . Cells were transfected with the myc - tagged RBD ( Rac Binding Domain ) of POSH 3 ( RBD - POSH ) in order to prevent endogenous Rac from binding to its effectors , as described in Fig . 3b . After serum starvation , cells were stimulated with EGF and processed for immunofluorescence . Staining with phalloidin ( red ) and anti - myc ( green ) allowed the detection of F - actin and transfected cells , respectively . Representative Z - stack projections are shown . Bar is 10 µ m . ( e ) The blockade of Rac - downstream pathways leads the formation of filopodia - like protrusions also via mDia2 . The analysis of the different phenotypes shown by myc - RBD - POSH - transfected ( + ) or untransfected ( - ) cells in both control ( ctr ) and mDia2 KD HeLa cells was done as in Fig . 2f . ( f ) Rac functional inhibition results in Cdc42 being more active after EGF stimulation . Wild - type HeLa cells were transfected with either myc - RBD - POSH ( + ) or an empty vector ( - ) . Quiescent HeLa cells were stimulated either with EGF for the indicated times ( 1 , 3 min ) or mock treated ( 0 ) . Equal amounts of total cellular lysates were either incubated with GST - CRIB ( GTP - bound Cdc42 ) or directly immunoblotted ( total , 4 % ) with the indicated antibodies .

The average cellular area was calculated as follows : total area / number of cells completely and partially included in the picture . Data in the graph ( Fig . 2d ) represent the mean + / - SEM of three independent experiments in which at least 50 cells per each condition were measured . Comparison of serum - starved and EGF - treated cells showed a small , but not statistically significant , area increase ( not shown ) . Densitometry In Fig 1h , the dissociation equilibrium constant ( K d ) was calculated with PRISM3 using the densitometric values of affinity - precipitated WAVE2 . In Fig . 3d , the mDia2 doublet and WAVE were measured . Values were obtained as the ratio between mDia2 and WAVE and normalized with respect to the co - immunoprecipitation observed in either serum - starved or empty - vector - transfected cells , respectively . Live - cell imaging Supplementary movie S1 was made with a 63x objective together with a 1 . 6x - magnifying Optovar lens in the DIC mode . Briefly , Nap1 KD cells were plated on gelatin - coated 25 - mm - round coverslips . After serum deprivation , they were transferred in an open 2 Attofluor cell chamber ( Invitrogen ) , stimulated with EGF and positioned on the microscope stage . An environmental control chamber maintained the temperature at 37 °C during the observation period . Three minutes later , recording at 6 frames per minute began and lasted ten minutes in order to highlight filopodial dynamics . Data were stored as 16 - bit digital images , analyzed and subsequently processed with ImageJ . Intensity plots Images were imported as tif files in ImageJ . After tracing a straight line along selected filopodia , the RGB profiler plugin permitted to obtain the graphs presented in Fig . S4 . Protein expression and purification All pGEX - based GST - fusion proteins were expressed in the BL21 E . coli strain . Briefly , overnight cultures were diluted 1 / 100 in LB broth supplemented with Ampicillin and incubated at 37ºC until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0 . 7 . Cells were then switched to 20ºC and induced with IPTG according to GE Healthcare’s instructions . After 14 - 16 hours cells were collected and lysed ( 10 ml of Lysis Buffer / l of culture ) , as previously described 1 . Clarified lysates were incubated for 2 hours with glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads . After extensive washes , beads were either stored in PBS and 10 % glycerol at - 80ºC or further processed . Dialysis was carried out overnight at 4ºC in 4 liters of Dialysis Buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT and 20 % glycerol ) . WAVE2 was not readily soluble at concentrations higher that 1 . 5 µ M . Attempts to further concentrate this protein resulted in considerable precipitation , thus giving only tiny amounts of 6 µ M WAVE2 . GST - WAVE2 Δ VPH was completely insoluble . Quantification of actin - based protrusions 3 The morphology of the actin cytoskeleton was analyzed using a wide - field microscope equipped with 63x ( 1 . 4 N . A . ) Oil objective . Cells were scored positive for filopodia when finger - like , actin - rich protrusions were clearly emerging from the surrounding edge ( i . e . when the shape was a spike but not a cone ) with lengths appreciable under the microscope ( i . e . approximately 3 . 5 µ m ) , and at least two of these protrusions per cell could be observed . In all quantifications we considered only those cells located at the periphery of islands and presenting free borders . In this manner we were able to determine accurately the presence / absence of filopodia . Percentages were always calculated as a function of the cells analyzed . Cells completely embedded in islands , often formed by HeLa , were excluded . EGF induces ruffles typically departing from the base of HeLa cells and protruding dorsally . Ruffles encompass also the apical membrane of HeLa cells and often are curled towards the center . These structures can be easily observed under the microscope by focusing on the upper part of the cell under inspection . Since ruffles are actin - rich and thick , they are clearly highlighted by phalloidin . Cells were scored positive for ruffles when at least one bright , actin - rich and thick curled structure could be unequivocally assigned to a cell . Cells were classified as “flat” when both filopodia and ruffles were absent . 4 Supplemental references 1 . Innocenti , M . et al .
