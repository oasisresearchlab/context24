Suomalainen and M . Y . Nakano contributed equally to this work Nuclear targeting of adenovirus is mediated by the microtubule - dependent , minus - end - directed motor complex dynein / dynactin , in competition with plus - end - directed motility . We demonstrate that adeno - virus transiently activates two distinct signaling path - ways to enhance nuclear targeting . The ﬁrst pathway activates integrins and cAMP - dependent protein kinase A ( PKA ) . The second pathway activates the p38 / MAP kinase and the downstream MAPKAP kinase 2 ( MK2 ) , dependent on the p38 / MAPK kinase MKK6 , but independent of integrins and PKA . Motility measurements in PKA - inhibited , p38 - inhibited or MK2 - lacking ( MK2 – / – ) cells indicate that PKA and p38 stimulated both the frequency and velocity of minus - end - directed viral motility without affecting the perinuclear localization of transferrin - containing endosomal vesicles . p38 also suppressed lateral viral motilities and MK2 boosted the frequency of minus - end - directed virus transport . Nuclear target - ing of adenovirus was rescued in MK2 – / – cells by over - expression of hsp27 , an MK2 target that enhances actin metabolism . Our results demonstrate that com - plementary activities of PKA , p38 and MK2 tip the transport balance of adenovirus towards the nucleus and thus enhance infection . Keywords : adenovirus / MAPK / microtubules / PKA / regulated nuclear targeting Introduction Eukaryotic cells have two principal mechanisms of intracellular motility : microtubule - and actin ﬁlament - based systems and their associated motor proteins . Microtubules have been proposed to serve as tracks for long - range transport of organelles and pathogens either towards or away from the cell center ( Sheetz , 1999 ) . Actin ﬁlaments seem to support local organelle transport preferentially . Both of these motility systems are exploited by intracellular pathogens ( Dramsi and Cossart , 1998 ; Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ; Sodeik , 2000 ) . Adenovirus ( Ad ) , which replicates in the cell nucleus , is an example of a pathogen that traverses the cytoplasm by microtubule - mediated motility when entering into a new host cell ( Suomalainen et al . , 1999 ; Leopold et al . , 2000 ) . Cytosolic Ad particles engage in both minus - and plus - end - directed motilities along stable microtubules . Minus - end - directed motions are mediated by the dynein / dynactin motor complex , but the plus - end - directed motor remains to be characterized . Switching between minus - and plus - end - directed motions occurs frequently . In model cell lines like HeLa and TC7 , the minus - end - directed motility is dominant , causing net movement of particles towards the perinuclear microtubule organizing center and the nucleus at population speeds in the order of micrometers per minute ( Suomalainen et al . , 1999 ) . At present , it is unknown how the balance between minus - and plus - end - directed motions is maintained . Signal transduction is emerging as an important regu - lator of early virus – host interactions . Two basic mech - anisms account for virus - induced cell signaling : the activation of surface receptor ( s ) during lytic or non - lytic replication and the deposition of signaling molecules into a target cell . Activation of viral receptors can stimulate or counteract cellular antiviral defenses , enhance apoptosis or facilitate virus entry and production ( Pelchen - Matthews et al . , 1999 ; Wallach et al . , 1999 ; Griego et al . , 2000 ; Krijnse Locker et al . , 2000 ) . Similarly , the delivery of activated MAPK by incoming HIV - 1 seems to facilitate early step ( s ) of virus infection ( Jacque et al . , 1998 ) . Studies on Ad support the importance of cell signaling in virus entry . Ad2 or Ad5 initially docks to the immuno - globulin gene family receptor CAR ( Coxsackie B virus adenovirus receptor ; Bergelson et al . , 1997 ) and initiates infection in the absence of the cytosolic and membrane - spanning CAR domains ( Wang and Bergelson , 1999 ) . Viral interactions with a v b 5 integrins activate the lipid kinase PI3K , the small G proteins cdc42 and rac1 , and trigger endocytosis ( Nemerow and Stewart , 1999 ) . Virus escapes to the cytosol by causing disruption of endocytic vesicles , and the particle then engages in bidirectional movement along microtubules ( Suomalainen et al . , 1999 ) . Here we show that incoming Ad2 triggers two distinct signaling pathways , which increase cytosolic motility and boost minus - end - directed motions of viral particles along microtubules . The upregulated signaling pathways are necessary for efﬁcient delivery of viral genome to the nucleus . Results Cytosolic Ads have two types of motility : bidirectional microtubule - dependent long - range motility and short - range microtubule - independent lateral motion . We ﬁrst asked whether incoming Ad2 signals to the host cell stimulate motilities of cytosolic particles . Texas red - labeled intact Ad2 ( Ad2 – TR ) particles were microinjected Adenovirus - activated PKA and p38 / MAPK pathways boost microtubule - mediated nuclear targeting of virus The EMBO Journal Vol . 20 No . 6 pp . 1310 – 1319 , 2001 1310 ª European Molecular Biology Organization into HeLa cells . Prior to injection , virus binding sites at the cell surface were saturated with an excess of soluble ﬁber knob fragments to preclude natural infections ( Louis et al . , 1994 ; Nakano and Greber , 2000 ) . Cells were imaged in live ﬂuorescence mode and individual viral particles traced at 15 – 70 min post - injection . Microinjected Ad2 particles showed homogeneous motilities at low levels . Vectorial velocities of elementary motion steps ( ES ; movement of a particle between two subsequent frames ) were center directed ( v c ) , periphery directed ( v p ) or directed to lateral sides ( v l ) and reached levels of 0 . 11 – 0 . 12 m m / s , giving a population velocity of – 0 . 05 m m / min towards the nucleus ( Figure 1A ) . The motility frequency ( % ES > 0 . 1 m m / s ) was 20 % . Challenging the injected cells by an infection with unlabeled Ad2 before adding ﬁber knobs increased the overall motility frequency of the ﬂuorescent particles to 52 % ( Figure 1B ) . The challenge also signiﬁcantly increased ( p < 0 . 01 ) the three vectorial ES components to 0 . 16 – 0 . 17 m m / s and shifted the population velocity to 0 . 21 m m / min towards the periphery . Stimulated motilities were not dependent on microtubule treadmilling and dynamic instability since stabilization of microtubules with taxol had no effect on viral motilities ( not shown ) . Complete disruption of the microtubule network by combined cold and nocodazole ( noc ) treatments reduced the population velocity to 0 . 03 m m / min and the motility frequency to 8 % , and also diminished v p , v l and v c ( p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 1C ) . Taken together , these results indicate that a wild - type infection predominantly stimu - lated microtubule - dependent motilities of intact cytosolic virus particles . Ad - induced PKA activity required for nuclear targeting Intracellular cAMP levels regulate microtubule - dependent transport of melanosomes in ﬁsh and amphibian chromato - phores ( Reilein et al . , 1998 ; Reese and Haimo , 2000 ) . We therefore tested whether interference with cAMP - dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) activity affected nuclear accumulation of incoming Ad2 . HeLa cells were pre - treated with a cell - permeable speciﬁc peptidic inhibitor of PKA ( PKI - myr at 55 m M ; Gamm and Uhler , 1995 ) . The subcellular localization of Ad2 – TR was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) at 70 min post - infection ( p . i . ) . Control untreated cells enriched Ad2 – TR in the cell center ( Figure 2A , a ) coincident with the nucleus ( not shown ) , whereas PKA - inhibited cells contained many virus particles near the cell periphery ( Figure 2A , b , arrows ) . Quantitative ﬂuorescence micro - scopy demonstrated that PKI - myr - treated cells contained signiﬁcantly more virus ﬂuorescence near the periphery and in the cytoplasmic area than control cells or cells treated with a control myristoylated peptide , autocamptide ( 80 m M ) , an inhibitor of calcium / calmodulin - dependent kinase II ( p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 2B ) . Conversely , PKI - myr - treated cells failed to enrich Ad2 at the nucleus ( p < 0 . 01 ) and the perinuclear region ( not shown ) . Viral DNA was found at reduced levels in the nucleoplasm of PKI - myr - treated cells ( Figure 2A , c and d ) . Other PKA inhibitors , such as KT5720 ( 5 m M ) and H89 ( 40 m M ) , which are directed to the ATP binding site , gave similar results ( not shown ) . The PKI - myr effects on Ad2 localization were largely reversible by washing out the inhibitor and stimulating PKA activity with forskolin and the diesterase inhibitor isobutyl methylxanthine ( IBMX ) for 60 min ( p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 2B ) . Washing out the inhibitor without PKA stimulation was not effective ( not shown ) , suggesting that efﬁcient nuclear targeting of Ad2 requires stimulated PKA . We tested whether incoming Ad2 activated cellular PKA . Virus was bound to HeLa cells in the cold and cells Fig . 1 . Ad2 infection stimulates microtubule - dependent motility of cytosolic microinjected Ad2 particles . Microinjected Ad2 – TR was analyzed by time - lapse ﬂuorescence microscopy and ES were analyzed for each particle ( n ) in control HeLa cells ( A ) , HeLa cells challenged with a normal Ad2 infection ( B ) or with Ad2 plus nocodazole ( C ) . Population velocities , population motilities , average vectorial velocities to the center ( v c ) , the periphery ( v p ) and lateral directions ( v l ) were determined based on the number of ES from n particles . Supplementary animation is available at The EMBO Journal Online . Regulated nuclear targeting of adenovirus 1311 were infected at 37 (cid:176) C for different times . PKA activity was determined using the kemptide assay and kinase activity expressed as a percentage of the total PKA activity measured in the presence of cAMP . In Ad2 - infected cells , we have observed a consistent , transient ~ 3 . 5 - fold upregulation of kemptide phosphorylation , which peaked at 15 – 30 min p . i . ( Figure 3A ) . This activity was largely due to stimulation of PKA , since the speciﬁc PKA inhibitor PKI a or a pre - treatment of cells with the cell - permeable inhibitor H89 ( 40 m M ) strongly reduced virus - induced kemptide phosphorylation ( Figure 3B and C ) . The Ad2 - induced kinase activity amounted to ~ 3 % of the total cellular PKA activity and was comparable to forskolin induction ( Figure 3B ) . Forskolin - but not virus - induced activity was further boosted by the diesterase inhibitor IBMX . Stimulation of PKA activity depended on the amount of input virus . A reliable readout was obtained at ~ 10 4 particles per cell and peaked at 10 5 particles per cell ( Figure 3C ) . Using radiolabeled Ad2 , we estimated that under these conditions ~ 2 % of input particles actually bound to the cells , thus suggesting that a few hundred virus particles per cell were sufﬁcient to allow PKA measure - ments . Importantly , binding and internalization of the non - infectious Ad2 mutant ts1 did not stimulate PKA , suggesting that wild - type virus stimulated cellular PKA levels rather than imported the activity into the cell ( Figure 3C ) . Accordingly , we did not detect any PKA activity in puriﬁed Ad2 particles ( data not shown ) . Activation of PKA required Ad2 contacts to surface integrins since blocking of these contacts by cRGD ( cyclic arginine - glycine - aspartate ) peptides ( 0 . 2 mM ) or treat - ment of cells with low Ca 2 + medium inhibited PKA stimulation ( Figure 3D ) . Since cRGD or low Ca 2 + medium also inhibits virus uptake and penetration into the cytoplasm ( Greber et al . , 1997 ; Nemerow and Stewart , 1999 ) , it was possible that some downstream event , rather than virus interaction with integrins , was required for PKA activation . However , this is unlikely since calphostin ( 1 m M ) , which targets protein kinase C and inhibits virus escape from endosomes ( Nakano et al . , 2000 ) , had no effect on PKA activation ( Figure 3D ) . Similarly , noc treatment of cells only moderately reduced PKA activation ( Figure 3D ) . Collectively , these observations show that incoming Ad2 transiently activates PKA by contacting cell surface integrins . This stimulation sets the stage for effective nuclear translocation of the incoming virus particles . Activation of p38 / MAPK but not ERK1 , 2 is needed for nuclear targeting of Ad2 Incoming Ad5 upregulates the Raf / MAPK signaling pathway 15 – 20 min p . i . , leading to a delayed production of interleukin ( IL ) - 8 ( Bruder and Kovesdi , 1997 ) . We ﬁrst tested whether activation of ERK1 , 2 was required for nuclear transport of Ad2 by infecting HeLa cells in the presence or absence of the MAPK kinase ( MEK1 ) inhibitor PD98059 ( PD ; 20 m M ; Alessi et al . , 1995 ) . Although PD completely eliminated activated ERK1 , 2 ( Figure 5E ) , nuclear transport of Ad2 was unaffected in PD - treated cells ( Figure 4A , e and f ) , demonstrating that activation of the MEK / ERK1 , 2 pathway was not required for virus entry . Accordingly , PD had no effect on the activation of PKA , indicating that MEK and ERK did not activate PKA in Ad2 - infected cells ( Figure 3D ) . Viral infections commonly induce cellular stress path - ways ( Miller and Raab - Traub , 1999 ; Tang et al . , 1999 ) . Recent results suggested that stress activation is linked to microtubule - dependent motor function ( Nagata et al . , 1998 ; De Vos et al . , 2000 ) . To determine whether the stress - activated p38 / MAPK pathway affected nuclear transport of Ad2 we treated cells with SB203580 ( SB ; 10 m M ) , a speciﬁc inhibitor of the a , b isoforms of p38 / MAPK ( Beyaert et al . , 1996 ) . Analysis of Ad2 – TR ﬂuorescence by CLSM and quantitative ﬂuorescence Fig . 2 . Nuclear targeting and DNA import of Ad2 are blocked by PKA inhibitors . ( A ) Control or PKI - myr - treated HeLa cells were infected with Ad2 – TR for 70 min ( a and b , red ) or with unlabeled Ad2 for 180 min ( c and d ) , ﬁxed and processed for tubulin staining ( a and b , green ) or for FISH analysis of viral DNA ( red ) using lamins A , B , C ( green ) as nuclear envelope markers ( c and d ) . The entire stack of Ad2 – TR images is shown in ( a ) and ( b ) . Three merged optical sections from comparable z - regions of the cells are shown for viral DNA ( c and d ) . Clustering of Ad2 – TR in the periphery of PKI - myr - treated cells is highlighted by arrows . Note the cytoplasmic background staining of the lamins in the FISH assays ( c and d ) . Scale bar = 10 m m . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of the subcellular localization of Ad2 – TR . Control cells and cells pre - treated with PKI - myr or myristoylated autocamptide ( atc - m ) were infected with Ad2 – TR for 0 , 60 or 120 min , followed by washout of PKI - myr and subsequent incubation in drug - free medium containing forskolin ( forsk ) and IBMX as indicated . The mean values of TR ﬂuorescence in the cell periphery , the cytoplasm and the nuclear areas are indicated , including the SEM , p values and the number of cells analyzed ( n ) . M . Suomalainen et al . 1312 microscopy indicated that nuclear targeting of Ad2 was inhibited in SB - treated cells ( Figure 4A and B ) . Cells treated with SB202474 , a pyridinyl imidazole related to SB but inactive on p38 ( Lee et al . , 1994 ) , had a slightly reduced nuclear targeting index of 2 . 9 , compared with 3 . 4 for control and 1 . 3 for SB - treated cells ( not shown ) . Importantly , the perinuclear localization of internalized transferrin was not affected by the p38 inhibitor SB , indicating that p38 was speciﬁcally required for intra - cellular targeting of Ad2 but not for microtubule - dependent endosomal transport ( Figure 4A , b and d ) . SB treatment increased the levels of virus particles in the periphery and the cytoplasm at 90 and 140 min p . i . , compared with control cells ( p = 0 . 025 and p < 0 . 01 ) , and decreased virus ﬂuorescence near the nucleus ( p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 4B ) and the perinuclear region ( not shown ) . This inhibition was partially reversed by SB washout and p38 stimulation by sorbitol ( see Raingeaud et al . , 1996 ) . Drug washout without sorbitol was not effective , suggesting that p38 induction was crucial for nuclear targeting of Ad2 ( not shown ) . Whether p38 activation was in fact required for Ad2 nuclear targeting was tested by transient transfection of dominant - negative ( dn ) MKK6 ( K82A ) ( Figure 4C ) . p38 is a major target of MKK6 and not activated in the presence of dn MKK6 ( Raingeaud et al . , 1996 ) . MKK6 ( K82A ) or constitutively active MKK6 ( EE207 / 211 ) , but not constitutively active MEK1 ( EE217 / 221 ) or eGFP alone ( not shown ) , blocked nuclear and perinuclear targeting of Ad2 , and increased the levels of peripheral ( p < 0 . 01 ) and cytoplasmic virus ( compared with non - transfected control cells of Figure 4B ) . The observation that constitutively active MKK6 was apparently a slightly better inhibitor of nuclear ( but not perinuclear ) targeting of Ad2 was most likely due to cell elongation ( spindle - like shape ) by MKK6 ( K82A ) overexpression , rather than a real difference in nuclear accumulation ( not shown ) . Importantly , overexpression of the phosphorylation - defective dn p38 ( T180A , Y182F ) also blocked Ad2 nuclear targeting ( not shown ) . Collectively , the results indicated that p38 stimulation by MKK6 is required for Ad2 nuclear targeting . Stimulation of the p38 pathway by inﬂammatory cytokines or stress conditions activates the p38 target MAPKAP kinase 2 ( MK2 ) , a serine / threonine protein kinase with both nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates . One of these substrates is hsp27 , a member of the a - crystalline family of small heat shock proteins , and a regulator of ﬁlamentous actin and cell contractility ( Stokoe et al . , 1992 ; Rousseau et al . , 1997 ; Schafer et al . , 1999 ) . We tested whether Ad2 entry required MK2 by evaluating nuclear targeting in mouse MK2 knockout ( MK2 – / – ) cells . Wild - type MK2 + / + cells efﬁciently transported Ad2 to the nucleus at 70 min p . i . , but MK2 – / – cells had signiﬁcantly lower amounts of perinuclear and nuclear Ad2 , and , Fig . 3 . Transient activation of PKA by incoming Ad2 requires cell surface integrins . Drug - treated or control HeLa cells were incubated in the cold with 6 3 10 4 Ad2 particles per cell ( or as indicated ) for 1 h , washed with virus - free medium and warmed up for different times . Kemptide phosphorylations ( representing PKA activity ) were determined in cell lysates at 15 min p . i . and normalized to the total cAMP - induced kemptide phosphorylations . ( A ) PKA stimulation by Ad2 is transient and peaks at 15 min p . i . Phospho - kemptide amounts are indicated as the mean values ( left axis ) including the SEM and number of independent experiments ( n ) . Fold activation of infected ( dark bars ) over non - infected ( light bars ) cells is indicated by the solid line . ( B ) Ad2 - stimulated PKA activation amounts to ~ 3 % of the total cellular PKA activity and is comparable to the levels in forskolin - stimulated HeLa cells , which can be boosted by the diesterase inhibitor IBMX . Recombinant PKI added to the cell lysates reduced both Ad2 - and cAMP - stimulated kemptide phosphorylations to near background levels . ( C ) PKA activation is dependent on Ad2 particle dose ( p / cell ) and diminished by pre - incubating cells with the PKA inhibitor H89 . The Ad2 mutant ts1 fails to stimulate kemptide phosphorylation . ( D ) cRGD or low - calcium medium , but not the PKC inhibitor calphostin ( calph ) , the MEK inhibitor PD or nocodazole block Ad2 - induced kemptide phosphorylation . Regulated nuclear targeting of adenovirus 1313 instead , increased levels of cytoplasmic and peripheral virus ( Figure 4D ) . Nuclear targeting of Ad2 in MK2 – / – cells was rescued by overexpression of hsp27 or hsp27 ( 3D ) , which mimics phosphorylated hsp27 . These results show that four components of the p38 pathway are involved in nuclear targeting of Ad2 : MKK6 , p38 , MK2 and hsp27 . To test whether incoming Ad2 upregulated the p38 pathway , MK2 was immunoprecipitated from infected and non - infected cell lysates and its activity determined using [ g - 32 P ] ATP and a peptidic substrate ( KKLNRTLSVA ) . Infected cells ( ~ 4 3 10 4 Ad2 added per cell ) contained up to 3 . 9 - fold higher MK2 activities than non - infected cells ( Figure 5A ) . Elevated activities were ﬁrst detectable at 15 min , peaked at 30 min and persisted at a 1 . 5 - fold higher level over non - infected cells up to 105 min p . i . Ad2 - induced MK2 activity was ~ 2 - fold lower than sorbitol - induced activity ( Figure 5A and D ) . MK2 stimulation was suppressed by ﬁber knobs , indicating that Ad2 binding to the target cells was required for MK2 activation ( not shown ) . We did not detect MK2 stimulation with the Ad2 mutant ts1 ( Figure 5B ) . This was probably not due to the penetration defect of ts1 , since elevated MK2 activities were detected with wild - type Ad2 in cells treated with jasplakinolide ( 180 nM ) , an F - actin - stabilizing drug that inhibits Ad2 uptake and penetration ( Figure 5C ; Nakano et al . , 2000 ) . As expected , the Ad2 - induced stimulation of MK2 was completely inhibited by 10 m M SB , but was only moderately affected by pre - treatment of infected cells with noc or the cell - permeable PKA inhibitor peptide PKI - myr or by the MEK1 inhibitor PD ( Figure 5C ) . MK2 was clearly activated by Ad2 in the presence of cRGD peptides or in low - calcium medium , albeit to somewhat reduced levels compared with control cells ( Figure 5C ) . MK2 activity was not induced by cRGD peptides alone or by the PKA stimulators forskolin or dibuturyl cAMP ( dBrcAMP ; 0 . 5 mM ) , a cell - permeable cAMP analog ( Figure 5D ) . This suggested that MK2 and PKA activations originate from two distinct pathways . Fig . 4 . Nuclear targeting of Ad2 requires MKK6 - activated p38 and the downstream p38 targets MK2 and hsp27 . ( A ) Control , SB - or PD - treated HeLa cells were infected with Ad2 – TR for 70 min ( a , c and e , red ) in the presence of transferrin – FITC ( tfn at 20 m g / ml from 40 to 60 min p . i . , b and d ) , ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde and analyzed by CLSM . Projections of all the optical sections are shown . One corresponding differential interference contrast image ( DIC ) is shown in ( f ) . Scale bar = 10 m m . ( B ) Quantiﬁcation of the subcellular localization of Ad2 – TR in serum - starved control cells and cells pre - treated with SB ( 10 m M ) . HeLa cells were infected with Ad2 – TR for 0 , 90 or 140 min , followed by washout of SB and subsequent incubation in drug - free medium containing sorbitol ( 0 . 4 M ) . The mean values of TR ﬂuorescence in the cell periphery , the cytoplasm and the nuclear area are indicated , including the SEM , p values and the number of cells analyzed . ( C ) Dominant - negative ( dn ) and constitutively active MKK6 block Ad2 nuclear targeting . HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding constitutively active MKK6 ( 2E ) , constitutively active MEK1 ( 2E ) and dn MKK6 ( K82A ) in the presence of limiting amounts of eGFP plasmid DNA . Ad2 – TR ﬂuorescence was quantitated in eGFP - positive cells . ( D ) Quantiﬁcation of the subcellular localization of Ad2 – TR in MK2 + / + , MK2 – / – and MK2 – / – cells transfected with plasmids encoding a myc - tagged hsp27 or a myc - tagged hsp27 - 3D . Cells were infected with Ad2 – TR for 70 min , stained for the myc tag using Alexa488 - labeled anti - mouse IgG and processed for subcellular analysis of Ad2 – TR . M . Suomalainen et al . 1314 PKA and p38 boost microtubule - dependent minus - end - directed motilities of cytosolic Ad2 We have shown so far that Ad2 infections enhance viral motilities and stimulate PKA and MK2 activities for efﬁcient nuclear targeting of incoming virus . Additional experiments , including quantitative electron microscopy analysis and kinetic uptake measurements , indicated that PKA , p38 and MK2 were not needed for virus delivery to the cytosol ( see Supplementary ﬁgure 1 , available at The EMBO Journal Online ) . To investigate whether these protein kinases regulated motilities of cytosolic Ad2 , we performed particle tracking analyses of Ad2 – TR in control or inhibitor - treated HeLa cells at 20 – 60 min p . i . , or in mouse MK2 – / – and control MK2 + / + cells at 30 – 45 min p . i . ( i . e . when virus is in the cytosol ) . ES were quantitated in terms of directionality and intensity , and results expressed as motility indexes and population velocities . In drug - free HeLa cells , the population velocity ( pop . vel . ) was directed to the center ( – 0 . 57 m m / min ) and the motility index was 44 % ( Figure 6 ) . In contrast , the PKI - myr treated cells transported virus particles towards the periphery ( pop . vel . + 0 . 20 m m / min ) by inhibiting both the fre - quencies and extents of the center - directed velocity v c ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The overall virus motility was also reduced in the absence of PKA ( p < 0 . 01 ) . PKI - myr , however , had no effect on the periphery - directed motility v p . v p required intact microtubules since combined noc and PKI - myr treatments collapsed the population velocity to – 0 . 05 m m / min , and decreased both the extents and frequencies of center - and periphery - directed motion steps ( p < 0 . 01 ) . To compare lateral motilities under different treatments we calculated the relative lateral motility indexes , deﬁned as 2 v l / ( v c + v p ) . This index was not affected by PKA inhibition ( lateral motility index = 0 . 74 ) , suggesting that PKA did not suppress lateral motions . The inhibition of p38 by SB had similar , but not identical effects to the inhibition of PKA ( Figure 6 ) . In SB - inhibited cells , v c was signiﬁcantly reduced and the net viral movement was directed towards the cell periphery ( pop . vel . + 0 . 12 m m / min ) , despite a reduced overall virus motility ( 30 % , p < 0 . 01 ) and a slightly reduced periphery - directed velocity ( v p = 0 . 11 m m / s , p = 0 . 05 ) . Like in the absence of PKA , periphery - directed net movement required intact microtubules , as indicated by combined SB and noc treatments ( Figure 6 ) . In these cells , the overall motility was signiﬁcantly higher than in cells treated with noc alone ( p < 0 . 01 ) . This is possibly due to increased lateral motility . Cells lacking both PKA and p38 activities had a near background population velocity ( 0 . 05 m m / min ) and signiﬁcantly reduced center - and periphery - directed motility frequencies ( Figure 6 ) . The relative lateral motility index increased compared with control cells ( 1 . 14 ) , but was similar to that obtained by SB treatment alone . Since inhibition of p38 alone also increased the Fig . 5 . Transient activation of MK2 by incoming Ad2 originates at the cell surface independent of integrins . Drug - treated or control HeLa cells were incubated in the cold with 4 3 10 4 Ad2 particles per cell ( or as indicated ) for 1 h , washed and warmed up for different times . Immunoisolated MK2 activity was determined at 30 min p . i . or as indicated and activity expressed as pmoles of [ g - 32 P ] ATP incorporated / min or fold activation over non - infected cultures . ( A ) MK2 stimulation by Ad2 is transient , peaking at 30 min , and detectable at least up to 105 min p . i . ( B ) Dose - dependent activation of MK2 by wild - type but not the mutant Ad2 ts1 . ( C ) MK2 activation is blocked by SB ( 10 m M ) , but not by PD ( 25 m M ) , PKI - myr ( 55 m M ) , cRGD peptides ( 0 . 2 mM ) , low calcium ( 0 . 1 m M ) , jasplakinolide ( Jas ; 180 nM ) or nocodazole ( Noc , 20 m M ) . ( D ) Ad2 - induced MK2 activity is in the range of hypertonic stress - induced MK2 activity , but no MK2 induction occurred by forskolin ( forsk , 5 m M ) , dBcAMP ( 1 m M ) or cRGD ( 0 . 2 mM ) alone . ( E ) Ad2 induces PD - sensitive ERK1 , 2 / MAPK phosphorylations . HeLa cells were treated with or without PD , infected with Ad2 for 15 min , and cell lysates were analyzed for phosphorylated and total ERK1 , 2 by western blotting . Regulated nuclear targeting of adenovirus 1315 lateral motility index , this indicates that in addition to enhancing the overall minus - end - directed viral motility , p38 also suppresses lateral Ad2 motions . This effect was independent of the p38 target MK2 , since MK2 – / – cells had the same lateral motilities as MK2 + / + cells ( Figure 6 ) . Like p38 - inhibited cells , MK2 – / – cells transported virus par - ticles preferentially to the periphery , albeit at higher speed ( pop . vel . = 1 . 33 m m / min compared with – 0 . 25 m m / min for control cells ) . This was mainly due to a strong decrease in the frequency of minus - end - directed motility steps ( p < 0 . 025 ) , and the slightly reduced center - directed and the increased periphery - directed velocities in SB - treated cells . MK2 – / – cells had a somewhat reduced overall motility frequency compared with control cells ( p = 0 . 025 ) . In summary , our results show that PKA , p38 and MK2 activations promote nuclear targeting of Ad2 either by stimulating the frequency and velocity of microtubule - dependent minus - end - directed motility steps or by redu - cing the velocity of plus - end - directed motilities in the case of p38 . Plus - end - directed motility frequencies were only affected by depolymerizing the microtubules , and not by PKA , p38 or MK2 activities . Discussion Cytoplasmic motility is crucial for nuclear targeting of incoming viral particles and infections ( Sodeik , 2000 ) . Here we show that incoming Ad2 upregulates two distinct cell signaling pathways , which lead to transient activations of PKA and p38 / MAPK pathways . Both of these pathways are required for efﬁcient nuclear targeting of infectious Ad2 . The signaling events function by tilting the balance of bidirectional microtubule - dependent movements to - wards the minus ends near the nucleus . Activation of PKA depends on RGD contacts between Ad2 and an integrin co - receptor , including the a v b 5 integrin ( Nemerow and Stewart , 1999 ) . The productive engagement of Ad2 with integrins is known to require an intact cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Nemerow and Stewart , 1999 ; Nakano et al . , 2000 ) . Activation of PKA through integrins has been linked to changes in the actin cytoskeleton and also to mechanical torsions of the plasma membrane ( Howe and Juliano , 2000 ; Meyer et al . , 2000 ) . It is , therefore , possible that Ad2 activation of PKA involves both integrins and functional F - actin . Although PKA activation roughly coincides with virus uptake , it does not function to facilitate viral endocytosis or escape from endosomes . Instead , it enhances the frequency and extent of microtubule - dependent , minus - end - directed virus transport steps . PKA is not required for plus - end - directed motility of virus , and in PKA - inhibited cells net virus movement is directed towards the cell periphery . Virus in the cell periphery can be rescued by artiﬁcial stimulation of PKA using forskolin and IBMX , implying that PKA activation rather than a basal activity is required Fig . 6 . Motility analysis of Ad2 – TR in HeLa cells treated with PKA or p38 inhibitors and in MK2 + / + and MK2 – / – mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts . Ad2 – TR was imaged in time - lapse mode and ES analyzed for each particle ( n ) in control or inhibitor - treated HeLa cells at 20 – 60 min p . i . , and in mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts at 30 – 45 min p . i . Population velocities , population motilities and the average fractions of the vectorial ES components ( mot c and mot p ) were determined as described in Materials and methods . v c and v p ( mean / SEM ) are the average vectorial velocity components to and from the center for each particle , respectively . v l depicts the mean lateral vectorial velocity and 2 v l / ( v c + v p ) is the relative fraction of the average lateral speeds . Light gray ( HeLa cells ) and dark gray shaded values ( mouse MK2 cells ) indicate signiﬁcant differences ( p < 0 . 05 ) to the control HeLa cells ( no drug ) and MK2 + / + cells , respectively . Note that the sum of mot c plus mot p approximates but is not identical to the population motility . Supplementary animation is available at The EMBO Journal Online . M . Suomalainen et al . 1316 to mediate minus - end - directed viral transport . The requirement of activated PKA for efﬁcient minus - end - directed motility of Ad is in marked contrast to regulated movement of pigment granules in melanophores , where activated PKA appears to facilitate the association of kinesin II - bearing granules with microtubules and inhibit microtubule association of cytoplasmic dynein but not dynactin ( Reese and Haimo , 2000 ) . Possibly , Ad2 inter - acts with another kinesin family member that is not subject to PKA regulation . Alternatively , PKA may regulate kinesin and dynein functions through accessory factors or act on only a subset of motor molecules ( Okada et al . , 1995 ; Reilein et al . , 1998 ) . Since Ad2 - or forskolin - induced PKA stimulations did not detectably affect endosomal transport of transferrin in human ( A549 , KB , HeLa ) or African green monkey kidney cells ( TC7 ; not shown ) , it is likely that PKA activation by Ad2 speciﬁcally enhances minus - end - directed transport of Ad . Further experiments are required to test whether PKA activation globally or locally enhances binding of dynein / dynactin to the viral cargo or the microtubules . The second pathway activated by incoming Ad2 is integrin - and PKA - independent , and includes p38 / MAPK , its upstream activating kinase MKK6 and the p38 target MK2 . MK2 activation peaks when most of the viral particles have arrived in the cytosol but not yet at the nucleus . The activated p38 pathway has several motility effects on cytosolic virus , complementing the PKA effects . If p38 is inhibited , both the frequency and the extent of the center - directed speeds are reduced . This is partially explained by lack of MK2 activation , since experiments in MK2 – / – cells indicated that MK2 is required for high - frequency minus - end - directed Ad2 motility . In contrast to PKA , which affects both the frequency and extent of minus - end - directed motility , MK2 appears to enhance the probability of dynein / dynactin - mediated transport . This function could be supported by the MK2 - target hsp27 , since nuclear targeting of Ad2 in MK2 – / – cells was rescued by overexpression of hsp27 or the phosphorylation state mimicking mutant hsp27 ( 3D ) . Since hsp27 affects a variety of processes , including microﬁlament modulation , cell migration , pinocytosis and also relief of cytotoxic stress ( Stokoe et al . , 1992 ; Rousseau et al . , 1997 ; Schafer et al . , 1999 ) , its role in the regulation of Ad2 trafﬁcking can be direct or indirect . Further experiments have to show how MK2 and hsp27 are involved in tilting the transport balance towards the nucleus . p38 also appears to regulate Ad2 motility independently of MK2 . Induction of p38 by constitutively active MKK6 ( EE207 / 211 ) abrogates nuclear targeting of Ad2 . Whether this is a direct or indirect effect due to autocrine activation of additional signaling pathways is unknown . Addition - ally , inhibition of p38 by the chemical SB or by catalytically dead dn MKK6 leads to virus accumulation in the cell periphery . This effect is not seen in MK2 – / – cells . It is possible that p38 activation reduces the activity of a plus - end - directed motor , such as kinesin . This possibility was recently suggested for mitochondrial transport to microtubule minus ends in mouse cells stimulated with tissue necrosis factor to induce p38 activation ( De Vos et al . , 2000 ) . However , p38 also appears to regulate microtubule - independent lateral motilities of Ad2 . These movements are processive and thus unlikely to be thermally driven Brownian motions . Their relative extent is increased in p38 - inhibited or noc - treated cells , but not in MK2 - deﬁcient or PKI - treated cells , suggesting that one function of p38 may be to suppress lateral motions and thus enhance nuclear target - ing of Ad2 . But why does incoming Ad utilize bidirectional microtubule - dependent transport ? Possibly , this motility helps to keep the viral particles on the microtubule tracks and reduces the possibility that the processivity of a particular motor becomes limiting . Such a mechanism might account for the high frequency of overall viral motility , similar to movements of lipid droplets in developing Drosophila embryos ( Welte et al . , 1998 ) . A switching mechanism could be subject to PKA , p38 , MK2 / hsp27 and additional factors controlling the activity of the motors . Such regulations may also depend on the viral structure , as suggested by our observation that the population velocity of microinjected intact Ad2 was directed to the periphery upon signaling by incoming virus , whereas partially uncoated Ad2 was targeted to the nucleus . Activation of stress responses is typical of viral infections and includes pro - inﬂammatory signaling lead - ing to tumor necrosis factor - a and IL - 6 production in macrophages ( Zsengeller et al . , 2000 ) . Whether , in addition to p38 , the Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) pathway also modulates Ad2 entry is not known . So far , we have failed to detect consistent activation of JNK using antibodies against activated JNK ( not shown ) . The Ad2 - activated classical MEK / ERK1 , 2 pathway , on the other hand , has no impact on the trafﬁcking of the incoming virus particles , but is implicated in the production of the inﬂammatory cytokine IL - 8 ( Bruder and Kovesdi , 1997 ) . The Ad2 - stimulated PKA and p38 pathways are likely to have nuclear effects as well , including a variety of transcriptional activations such as the phosphorylation of the cAMP - responsive element binding protein CREB ( Garrington and Johnson , 1999 ; Rolli et al . , 1999 ) . These events might create a favorable nuclear environ - ment for the incoming Ad genome . Interestingly , the p38 pathway was recently linked to the modulation of the splicing preference of the early Ad E1A pre - mRNA ( van der Houven van Oordt et al . , 2000 ) . UV or sorbitol - activated p38 appeared to favor the selection of distal rather than proximal splice sites and thus generated the long 12S and 13S E1A early transcripts , which are necessary to drive viral transcription and replication . In addition to the upregulated PKA and p38 / MAPK pathways described here , incoming Ad2 also stimulates PI3K and the small G proteins cdc42 and rac1 to facilitate its endocytic uptake ( Nemerow and Stewart , 1999 ) . Thus , different steps in Ad2 entry are highly coordinated by cell signaling . Future studies will explore the possibility that signaling pathways are common regulators of virus entry and may facilitate reﬁning gene delivery protocols and antiviral measures .

Transient transfections were carried out using TransFast (cid:212) ( Promega , Catalys , Switzerland ) in the presence of limiting amounts of eGFP – DNA ( InVitroGen , The Netherlands ) and cells analyzed 24 h later . Preparations and microinjec - tions of viruses were as described ( Nakano and Greber , 2000 ) .

For inhibitor experiments , cells were pre - incubated with drugs at 37 (cid:176) C for 30 min and drugs kept present throughout virus binding and internalization . In vitro PKA and MK2 kinase assays PKA activity was assayed in crude cell lysates using the peptidic substrate kemptide ( LRRASLG ; one - letter amino acid sequence code , porcine liver pyruvate kinase , Bachem AG , Switzerland ; Jans and Hemmings , 1991 ) . Brieﬂy , duplicate 30 mm plates of parallel infected and non - infected cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM 2 - [ N - morpholino ] ethane sulfonic acid ( MES ) – NaOH pH 6 . 9 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 on ice for 8 min . Insoluble material was removed by a 4 min full - speed centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 (cid:176) C ; supernatants of parallel samples were pooled and duplicate aliquots of the supernatants were assayed for kemptide phosphorylation activity in a reaction mixture containing 53 mM MES – NaOH pH 6 . 9 , 56 mM NaCl , 0 . 4 mM EDTA , 3 mM magnesium acetate , 1 . 3 mg / ml bovine serum albumin , 0 . 1 mg / ml kemptide , 0 . 1 mM ATP , ~ 1 m Ci [ g - 32 P ] ATP per assay . Samples were incubated at 30 (cid:176) C for 15 min and reactions stopped by spotting the liquid onto Whatman P81 ﬁlter papers . Filters were immersed and washed in 0 . 5 % phosphoric acid , air - dried and radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting using Ready - Safe ( Beckman Instruments ) . Background values of reactions lacking kemptide were subtracted from all values , and activities calculated as picomoles of ATP incorporatedinto kemptide / min / mg of protein . Results were expressed as a percentage of total PKA activity in cell extracts determined in the presence of cAMP ( 11 m M ) . The sensitivity of kemptide phosphorylations to the PKA inhibitor PKI was determined by including the full - length recombinant PKI ( 0 . 1 U / m l ; Calbiochem ) in the assay mixture . The protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using the DC assay kit ( BioRad ) . MK2 kinase activity was determined in immunocomplexes of lysates from infected and parallel non - infected cells using an acceptor peptide ( KKLNRTLSVA ; Upstate Biotechnology ) and [ g - 32 P ] ATP as indicated by the MK2 antibody supplier ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lucerna AG , Switzerland ) . Background values obtained from reactions lacking the acceptor peptide were subtracted from all values .

Activation of ERK1 , 2 Serum - starved HeLa cells were treated with or without PD , incubated with Ad2 in the cold , washed and warmed for 15 min in the presence or absence of PD .

Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10 000 g at 4 (cid:176) C , and supernatants were analyzed directly by SDS – PAGE and western blotting using monoclonal anti - active ERK1 , 2 antibody or rabbit anti - total ERK1 , 2 followed by goat anti - mouse – horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) and goat anti - rabbit – HRP ( Sigma , Fluka , Switzerland ) . Viral motilities , microscopy and entry Live data were acquired by a back - illuminated CCD camera ( Princeton Instruments ) using the MetaMorph software package ( Universal Imaging Corp . , Visitron GmBH , Germany ) and computed with Excel software ( Microsoft Corp . , USA ) as described ( Suomalainen et al . , 1999 ; Nakano and Greber , 2000 ) . Virus particles that underwent at least three ES > 0 . 1 m m / s during the sampling period of 1 – 2 min were randomly selected for analysis . ES < 0 . 1 m m / s were below the resolution of our tracking system and were scored as ‘no motility’ . Population velocities were calculated from the net distance traveled to and from the nucleus divided by the total time of sampling of the analyzed particles ( n ) . Population motilities represented the mean number of ES > 0 . 1 m m / s divided by the total number of ES of each particle . v c , v p and v l were deﬁned as the average vectorial velocity components to the center , the periphery and to lateral sides , respectively . mot c and mot p were deﬁned as the average fractions of the vectorial ES components > 0 . 1 m m / s directed towards the center ( c ) or the periphery ( p ) , including the SEM . p values were determined using one - sided t - tests . Quantiﬁcations of Ad2 – TR in subcellular regions of ﬁxed cells , CLSM and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridizations ( FISH ) were performed as described ( Suomalainen et al . , 1999 ; Nakano and Greber , 2000 ) . Internalization of [ 35 S ] methionine - labeled Ad2 into KT5720 ( 5 m M ) or SB ( 20 m M ) treated cells was carried out as described ( Greber et al . , 1993 ) . Ad2 localization at the plasma membrane , in endocytic vesicles and the cytosol of subconﬂuent control , PKI - myr ( 55 m M ) or SB ( 20 m M ) treated cells was determined by quantitative electron microscopy ( Nakano et al . , 2000 ) .
